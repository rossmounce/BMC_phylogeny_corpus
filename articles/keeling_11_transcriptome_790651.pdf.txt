Abstract
Background: In conifers, terpene synthases (TPSs) of the gymnosperm-specific TPS-d subfamily form a diverse
array of mono-, sesqui-, and diterpenoid compounds, which are components of the oleoresin secretions and
volatile emissions. These compounds contribute to defence against herbivores and pathogens and perhaps also
protect against abiotic stress.
Results: The availability of extensive transcriptome resources in the form of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and
full-length cDNAs in several spruce (Picea) species allowed us to estimate that a conifer genome contains at least
69 unique and transcriptionally active TPS genes. This number is comparable to the number of TPSs found in any
of the sequenced and well-annotated angiosperm genomes. We functionally characterized a total of 21 spruce
TPSs: 12 from Sitka spruce (P. sitchensis), 5 from white spruce (P. glauca), and 4 from hybrid white spruce (P. glauca
× P. engelmannii), which included 15 monoterpene synthases, 4 sesquiterpene synthases, and 2 diterpene
synthases.
Conclusions: The functional diversity of these characterized TPSs parallels the diversity of terpenoids found in the
oleoresin and volatile emissions of Sitka spruce and provides a context for understanding this chemical diversity at
the molecular and mechanistic levels. The comparative characterization of Sitka spruce and Norway spruce
diterpene synthases revealed the natural occurrence of TPS sequence variants between closely related spruce
species, confirming a previous prediction from site-directed mutagenesis and modelling.

Background
Conifer trees (order Coniferales; Gymnosperms) are
extremely long-lived plants that must confront a multitude of biotic and abiotic stresses that vary with the season and over their lifetime. Conifers have evolved
several resistance mechanisms that repel, kill, inhibit, or
otherwise reduce the success of herbivores and pathogens. These mechanisms include both mechanical and
chemical defences that can be present constitutively or
that are induced upon challenge [1,2]. As a major part
of their constitutive and inducible defensive repertoire,
conifers produce an abundant and complex mixture of
terpenoids in the form of oleoresin secretions and

volatile emissions [2,3]. The diversity of the terpenoids
in conifers suggests that, like in other plants [4], an
arms race has unfolded in the interactions of conifers
with other organisms through the production of specialized (i.e., secondary) metabolites. The diversity of conifer terpenoids includes predominantly monoterpenes,
sesquiterpenes and diterpenes, which originate from the
activity of a family of terpene synthases (TPSs), and
other enzymes, such as cytochromes P450, that may
functionalize some of the terpenes [2,5].
Despite much work on individual conifer TPSs [2], the
total number of TPSs present in any one conifer species
is not yet known since no conifer genome has been
sequenced to date. In contrast, the sequenced and annotated genomes of several angiosperm species provide an
indication of the diversity of TPSs we might expect to
see in any one plant species. For example, the genes

encoding putatively active mono-, sesqui-, and di-TPSs
number at least 32 in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis
thaliana) genome [6], at least 31 in the rice (Oryza
sativa) genome [7], at least 32 in the poplar (Populus
trichocarpa) genome [8], and at least 69 in the genome
of a highly inbred grapevine (Vitis vinifera) Pinot Noir
variety [9,10]. All of these angiosperm genomes contain
clusters of duplicated TPS genes. The large genome size
of conifers and the diversity of their terpenoid profiles
may suggest a similarly sized or potentially larger TPS
gene family in conifer species. However, targeted BAC
sequencing of a few conifer TPSs from white spruce
(Picea glauca) did not reveal any genomic clustering of
multiple TPS genes in this conifer genome [11,12].
Most of our current knowledge of the size, functional
diversity and phylogeny of gymnosperm TPSs is based on
targeted cDNA cloning and characterization in two conifer species, grand fir (Abies grandis) and Norway spruce
(P. abies), along with a few TPSs in other gymnosperms
[2]. In grand fir, 11 different TPS genes have been functionally characterized [13]. Martin et al. [14] described a
set of 9 different TPSs in Norway spruce (P. abies) and
examined the phylogeny of 29 gymnosperm TPSs, all of
which fell into the gymnosperm-specific TPS-d subfamily. A deeper understanding of the diversity and functional complexity of the conifer TPS-d subfamily requires
additional gene discovery by transcriptome mining. Large
collections of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and fulllength cDNAs (FLcDNAs) exist for several conifer species [15-17] and provide a rich resource for identifying
and functionally characterizing new TPSs.
Here, we have analyzed the ESTs and FLcDNAs from
Sitka spruce (P. sitchensis), white spruce (P. glauca), and
hybrid white spruce (P. glauca × P. engelmannii) to
identify a comprehensive set of expressed members of
the spruce TPS gene family. We have functionally characterized several members from each species for a total
of 21 newly characterized spruce TPSs. This work complements previous work in Norway spruce [14] and provides a molecular basis from which to explain much of
the chemical complexity of the oleoresin and volatile
terpenoids in spruce. Results of the functional gene
characterization are discussed in the context of previously reported terpenoid metabolite profiles of oleoresin and volatile emissions in Sitka spruce.

Results and Discussion
Identification of unique TPS sequences and isolation of
full-length TPS cDNA clones

The in silico analysis of 443,665 spruce ESTs identified
a total of 506 ESTs corresponding to putative TPSs
(Table 1). Assembly of these ESTs into contigs and singlets allowed us to estimate the minimum number of
actively expressed TPS genes in each of the three spruce
species of our analysis. We identified 69 unique TPS
sequences in white spruce, 55 in Sitka spruce, and 20
in hybrid white spruce. Although the rate of gene discovery was dependent on the depth of EST sequencing
(Table 1), the substantially deeper EST sequence coverage in white spruce (242,931 ESTs) did not result in a
proportional increase of TPS discovery relative to Sitka
spruce (174,384 ESTs) and hybrid white spruce (26,350
ESTs), suggesting that the majority of expressed TPSs in
the tissues sequenced were captured at the depth of
sequencing probed in white spruce and Sitka spruce.
The estimate of at least 69 TPSs in white spruce is comparable to the number of putatively active TPS genes
found in the sequenced genomes of angiosperms and is
perhaps a good approximation of the total number of
transcriptionally active TPS genes in a conifer species.
From the set of assembled TPS sequences, we examined
approximately 170 of the corresponding cDNA clones
by restriction digest, colony PCR and/or sequencing to
identify those which contained full ORFs. Eighteen
FLcDNA clones were selected for subcloning and functional characterization. In addition, three full-length
TPS cDNA clones were obtained by RACE cloning or
homology-based PCR cloning. As the Treenomix project
[16], which generated the available cDNA clones
focused its FLcDNA program on Sitka spruce, the
majority of the full-length TPS cDNA clones were from
this species (12 FLcDNAs). Five full-length TPS cDNA
clones originated from white spruce, and four from
hybrid white spruce.
Functional characterization of recombinant TPS enzymes

Most previously described conifer TPSs are multiproduct enzymes [14,18], and because the identity and
relative abundance of TPS products are very sensitive to
small changes in amino acid sequence [19-24], it is not
possible to accurately predict function based solely upon

*Conifer TPS protein sequences available from NCBI were used to query the three species-specific EST databases using the tBLASTn module of WU-BLAST 2.0 and
an E-value cut off of 1 × 10-5. The resulting outputs were filtered to exclude duplicates, and then assembled separately by species using CAP3 [49]. The total
TPSs represents an estimated minimum number of unique TPSs found in each species.

amino acid sequence similarity/phylogeny. While it
might be possible to infer a TPS gene function from the
chemical phenotype of a corresponding plant mutant,
the genetic resources for such an approach are available
only for a very few model systems such as Arabidopsis
[25]. Instead, in most systems, the functional annotation
of each TPS requires expression and enzyme characterization of recombinant protein.
Recombinant spruce TPSs were expressed in E. coli
and purified by Ni-affinity chromatography before assaying each individually with geranyl diphosphate (GPP),
farnesyl diphosphate (E,E-FPP), and geranylgeranyl
diphosphate (E,E,E-GGPP), the three respective transprenyl diphosphate substrates of conifer monoterpene

synthases, sesquiterpene synthases, and diterpene
synthases. Since two recent reports described the occurrence and conversion of cis-prenyl diphosphate substrates in tomato [26-28], we also assessed if spruce is
likely to produce these additional TPS substrates.
Mining of all available spruce EST sequences did not
reveal the presence of prenyltransferases for the formation of cis-prenyl diphosphate substrates (D. Hall and J.
Bohlmann; unpublished results).
In the following sections we describe the specific functional characterization of the 21 spruce TPSs (Figure 1).
With one exception, each of these TPSs only made
significant use of one of the substrates. Based upon
functional characterization, the 21 TPSs comprised

and 2 diterpene synthases. The product identities and
abundance for each TPS, including quantitative composition of multi-product profiles, is shown in Table 2,
and representative GCMS traces are shown in Figures 2,
3, and 4. A summary of the functional annotation along
with NCBI GenBank accession numbers appears in
Table 3. Results of the functional TPS characterization
are discussed in the context of previously reported
terpenoid metabolite profiles in Sitka spruce genotype
FB3-425 [see Supplemental Tables in [29]], from which
many of the functionally characterized TPS FLcDNAs
were isolated. Terpenoid profiles are also available from
a collection of 111 Sitka spruce accessions [30].

Functional characterization of monoterpene synthases:
(-)-a/b-pinene synthases

We characterized one new (-)-a/b-pinene synthase in
Sitka spruce (PsTPS-Pin) and two in white spruce
(PgTPS-Pin-1 and PgTPS-Pin-2; both originating from
the same genotype) (Tables 1 and 2). These three
enzymes clustered closely with the two previously

MONOTERPENE SYNTHASES

Functional characterization of monoterpene synthases:
(-)-b-phellandrene synthases

We identified four (-)-b-phellandrene synthases in Sitka
spruce (PsTPS-Phel-1, PsTPS-Phel-2, PsTPS-Phel-3, and
PsTPS-Phel-4), which shared 99% amino acid identity with
each other, suggesting that these genes represent nearly
identical allelic variants or very recently duplicated genes
in the two genotypes that they originated from (Table 3).
Interestingly, the Sitka spruce (-)-b-phellandrene synthases
were only 70% identical to the (-)-b-phellandrene synthase
from grand fir [13]. The phylogenetic distance between
the grand fir and Sitka spruce (-)-b-phellandrene synthases
(Figure 1) suggests that this specific gene function evolved
independently more than once. The identity and approximate quantities of the major [(-)-b-phellandrene,
(-)-b-pinene, and (-)-a-pinene] and minor products were
nearly identical between the four Sitka spruce (-)-bphellandrene synthases (Table 2), and the major products
and their approximate proportions were also the same
between the (-)-b-phellandrene synthases of grand fir and
spruce. To the best of our knowledge, a (-)-b-phellandrene
synthase has not previously been reported in any other
species of spruce [14,31]. In Sitka spruce, b-phellandrene
is a major component of the constitutive monoterpene
fraction in inner and outer stem tissue and in needles [see
Supplemental Tables in [29]]. In stems of Sitka spruce,
accumulation of b-phellandrene increased in response to
treatment of trees with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or insect
attack [29]. The Sitka spruce (-)-b-phellandrene synthases
identified here are likely responsible for this major monoterpenoid component of Sitka spruce oleoresin.

characterized (-)-a/b-pinene synthases from Sitka
spruce [32] and Norway spruce [14] in the TPS-d1
clade (Figure 1). The topology of this group of five
(-)-a/b-pinene synthases suggests that they represent
orthologs in the three spruce species of our comparison. The two pairs of (-)-a/b-pinene synthase genes in
white spruce and in Sitka spruce may represent
recently duplicated genes or allelic variants in each of
these two species. The two white spruce enzymes differed in only four amino acids between each other,
and the two Sitka spruce enzymes differed in only six
amino acids. The white spruce (-)-a/b-pinene
synthases were approximately 96% identical with the
(-)-a/b-pinene synthase in Norway spruce, and
approximately 96% identical with the (-)-a/b-pinene
synthases in Sitka spruce. The Sitka spruce (-)-a/bpinene synthases shared approximately 95% identity
with the Norway spruce enzyme. The (-)-a-pinene
synthase from loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) [33] and the
(-)-a/b-pinene synthase from grand fir [34] clustered
outside the group of the spruce (-)-a/b-pinene
synthases (Figure 1). These pine and grand fir
(-)-pinene synthases may be the corresponding orthologs outside of the spruce genus.
The two (-)-a/b-pinene synthases in white spruce
(PgTPS-Pin-1 and PgTPS-Pin-2) contained only four
amino acid differences: Q/R94, R/G217, S/N221, and
E/G599, but showed an opposing pattern in the relative amounts of a- and b-pinene produced by the
recombinant enzymes (67:33 and 29:71 a-pinene:bpinene, respectively, Table 2). Based upon homology
modelling with the limonene synthase from Mentha
spicata as a template [35], we examined whether any
of the four different residues were in or near the active
site. Only the residue at 599 (corresponding to M572
of the template) was near the active site. Although this
residue was not on the surface of the modelled active
site, it was directly behind the residues that contribute

to the active site surface near the tail of the substrate
analogue (approximately 8.5 Å away). One might
hypothesize that the E/G599 difference was the origin
of the observed product differences between the two
white spruce PgTPS-Pin variants. However, this residue
is glycine in a previously characterized (-)-a/b-pinene

synthase in Sitka spruce [32] and in a previously characterized (-)-a/b-pinene synthase in Norway spruce
[14], which all produce different ratios of a/b-pinene.
Therefore, the three other amino acid differences
further from the active site also contributed to product
profile differences.

In contrast to the white spruce enzymes PgTPS-Pin-1
and PgTPS-Pin-2, the newly characterized Sitka spruce
PsTPS-Pin enzyme produced a larger proportion of
(-)-b-pinene (more than 80%) and lesser amounts of
(-)-a-pinene (less than 13%), but also had four additional minor products not observed with the PgTPSPin enzymes (Table 2, Figure 2). This product profile
was substantially different from that of the second, previously characterized (-)-a/b-pinene synthase from
Sitka spruce, which is dominated by (-)-a-pinene
(more than 60% of total product) and lesser amounts
of (-)-b-pinene (less than 20% of total product) [32]. Of
all five spruce (-)-a/b-pinene synthases, the known
Norway spruce enzyme shows the greatest product
diversity with (-)-b-pinene (57%), (-)-a-pinene (27%),
and (-)-b-phellandrene (11%) as dominant products
along with five other minor constituents [14]. Similar
to the white spruce (-)-a/b-pinene synthase enzymes,
the previously characterized and more distantly related
(-)-a/b-pinene synthases from grand fir also produces

only (-)-a- and (-)-b-pinene (42% and 58%) [34]. The
known product profile of loblolly pine (Pinus taeda)
(-)-pinene synthase is substantially different, with
mostly (-)-a-pinene (79%) with lesser amounts of
(-)-b-pinene (4%) and additional minor products [33].
These comparisons of product profiles and ratios
across a set of orthologous, or likely orthologous, multiproduct (-)-pinene synthases show that overall
sequence relatedness is not a good indicator of the specific product profiles and ratios even for closely related
TPS enzymes.
The monoterpenes (-)-a-pinene and (-)-b-pinene are
prominent resin compounds in Sitka spruce [29,30] and
in Norway spruce [36,37]. In Norway spruce, induced
accumulation of these compounds in bark tissue of
MeJA-treated stems is the result of increased enzyme
activity, protein abundance, and transcript levels of
(-)-a/b-pinene synthase [38]. Previous work in
Sitka spruce also showed strong accumulation of transcripts detected with a (-)-a/b-pinene synthase probe in

(-)-Linalool was previously detected as the major volatile emission of MeJA-treated and weevil-attacked Sitka
spruce saplings in the genotype FB3-425 [29], similar to
the MeJA-induced emission of linalool from Norway
spruce [37]. Transcripts detected with a PaTPS-Lin
probe were strongly induced in needles of MeJA-treated
Sitka spruce [29]. Linalool volatiles are thought to function in indirect defence against herbivores. Apparently,
the (-)-linalool emissions in spruce do not originate
from the oleoresin reservoirs of severed resin ducts, but
from the induced de novo biosynthesis in other tissues.
The cloning of (-)-linalool synthase genes from Sitka
spruce and white spruce makes it possible to investigate,
in future work, the localization of these enzymes and
the corresponding transcripts in the needles using the
methods of laser-assisted tissue microdissection techniques [39] or immunofluorescence localization [40].

Functional characterization of monoterpene synthases:
(-)-Linalool synthases

We characterized two new (-)-linalool synthases in Sitka
spruce (PsTPS-Lin-1 and PsTPS-Lin-2) and one in
white spruce (PgTPS-Lin) (Tables 2 and 3, Figure 2).
Within the TPS-d1 clade, the Sitka spruce and white
spruce (-)-linalool synthases formed a group of orthologous genes with the previously cloned Norway spruce
(-)-linalool synthase (PaTPS-Lin) [14] (Figure 1). All of
these monoterpene synthases were single-product
enzymes producing exclusively an acyclic monoterpene
alcohol. They shared 86 to 98% amino acid sequence
identity, with Sitka spruce PsTPS-Lin1 and white spruce
PgTPS-Lin being the most closely related. Since the two
(-)-linalool synthases from Sitka spruce (91% identity
between them) originated from the same genotype (FB3425; Table 3), they are likely recently duplicated genes.

We recently identified a small clade of (+)-3-carene
synthases and sabinene synthases in two genotypes of
Sitka spruce that are resistant [genotype H898; PsTPScar1(R), PsTPS-car2(R), and PsTPS-sab(R)] or susceptible
[genotype Q903; PsTPS-car1(S), PsTPS-car3(S), and
PsTPS-sab(S)] to white pine weevil, Pissodes strobi [41].
Here, we identified two additional (+)-3-carene synthases,
one in a different genotype of Sitka spruce (genotype
FB3-425; PsTPS-Car1), and one in hybrid white spruce
(Pg×eTPS-Car1) (Tables 2 and 3, Figure 2). These two
(+)-3-carene synthases shared approximately 99% amino
acid identity to each other, and were likely the orthologues of the (+)-3-carene synthases PsTPS-car1(R) and
PsTPS-car1(S) recently described (Figure 1). Their product profiles were also highly similar for all of the major
and most of the minor products. These Sitka and hybrid
white spruce (+)-3-carene synthase genes were less similar to the previously characterized Norway spruce
(+)-3-carene synthase [42]. A (+)-3-carene synthase gene
has not yet been characterized for any conifer outside of
the genus Picea. The (+)-3-carene synthases were multiproduct enzymes, producing predominantly (+)-3-carene
synthase (approximately 53 to 66%) and terpinolene
(approximately 16%), with lesser amounts of (+)-sabinene
and several other minor products (Table 2). Despite the
similarity of product profiles, the Sitka spruce and hybrid
white spruce (+)-3-carene synthase both shared only 84%
percent amino acid sequence identity with the Norway
spruce TPS. This highlights how even enzymes with fairly
divergent primary sequence can share a similar, complex
product profile. The two most abundant products of the
Sitka spruce (+)-3-carene synthases, the monoterpenes
(+)-3-carene and terpinolene, have recently been identified as indicators for resistance against weevils in a

particular geographic region of Sitka spruce origin [30].
Substantial variation exists in the levels of (+)-3-carene
across the range of Sitka spruce [30]. The cloning of
(+)-3-carene synthases from resistant and susceptible
Sitka spruce enabled a detailed characterization of the
genetic variability and the molecular underpinnings of
(+)-3-carene formation in resistant and susceptible genotypes [41]. Previous work in Sitka spruce showed MeJAand weevil-induced accumulation of transcripts hybridizing to the Norway spruce (+)-3-carene synthase probe
[29]. Similarly, (+)-3-carene synthase was very strongly
induced at the transcript, protein, and enzyme activity
levels in Norway spruce treated with MeJA [38].
Functional characterization of monoterpene synthases:
1,8-Cineole synthases

In each of the three spruce species studied we identified
and characterized a single 1,8-cineole synthase, PgTPSCin, Pg×eTPS-Cin, and PsTPS-Cin (Tables 2 and 3, Figure 2). The three enzymes shared approximately 99%
sequence identity to each other and form a distinct
group in the TPS-d1 clade most closely related to the
linalool synthases. The 1,8-cineole synthases and the
linalool synthases are among only a few known conifer

monoterpene synthases that produce mainly oxygenated
monoterpenes instead of olefins. All three 1,8-cineole
synthases were multi-product enzymes with the amount
of the major 1,8-cineole product varying from approximately 60% of total product for PsTPS-Cin to approximately 90% for PgTPS-Cin. These three spruce enzymes
also had similar profiles of minor products (-)-aterpineol, (+)-a-pinene, b-pinene, myrcene and others
(Table 2 and Figure 2). Although 1,8-cineole has been
identified as a monoterpenoid component in needles
and MeJA-induced volatile emissions of Norway spruce
[37], and has recently been shown to inhibit attraction
in the field and response of an olfactory receptor neuron
to pheromone of a spruce beetle [43], this is the first
characterization of gymnosperm TPSs that produce this
compound.
Functional characterization of sesquiterpene synthases

A complex blend of sesquiterpenes is found in minor
quantities in the oleoresin of conifers, including Sitka
spruce [29] and Norway spruce [37]. Sesquiterpenes are
also present in the MeJA-induced volatile emissions of
Norway spruce [37] and in the MeJA- and weevilinduced volatile emissions in Sitka spruce [29]. For the

Keeling et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:43
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/43

three spruce species of our EST analysis, we cloned and
functionally characterized four FLcDNAs, PgTPS-Hum,
Pg×eTPS-Lonf, PsTPS-Lonp, and Pg×eTPS-Far/Oci, as
bona fide sesquiterpene synthases (Tables 2 and 3; Figure 3). PgTPS-Hum, Pg×eTPS-Lonf, PsTPS-Lonp only
used FPP as substrate and were typical multi-product
conifer sesquiterpene synthases such as those first identified in grand fir [18]. In contrast, Pg×eTPS-Far/Oci
was active both with GPP and FPP. This enzyme produced only (E,E)-a-farnesene, when assayed with FPP,
and (E)-b-ocimene and a small amount of myrcene,
when assayed with GPP. The previously characterized
(E,E)-a-farnesene synthases cloned from Norway spruce
[14] and loblolly pine [33] did not show this dual substrate utilization [14,33], although it has been observed
with apple (Malus × domestica) (E,E)-a-farnesene
synthase [44]. (E,E)-a-farnesene is major sesquiterpene
component of the MeJA- and weevil-induced volatile
emissions of Sitka spruce [29].
PgTPS-Hum produced predominantly a-humulene
(approximately 43%) and (E)-b-caryophyllene (approximately 38%), along with several minor products, similar
to the a-humulene synthase previously characterized in
Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) [45]. Pg×eTPS-Lonf produced longifolene (approximately 70%) and a-longipinene (approximately 30%). Unlike the longifolene
synthase from Norway spruce [14], this TPS did not
produce other minor products. Sitka spruce PsTPSLonp produced predominantly a-longipinene (approximately 48%) but also substantial amounts of longifolene,
g-himachalene, and other minor products. Longifolene
and a-longipinene were previously found in the resin of
untreated and induced Sitka spruce stems [29] and weevil attack caused an increase of these compounds.
PgTPS-Hum, Pg×eTPS-Lonf, PsTPS-Lonp belong to
the TPS-d2 clade of the gymnosperm TPS-d subfamily,
together with other conifer multi-product sesquiterpene
synthases (Figure 1). The hybrid white spruce Pg×eTPSFar/Oci appeared to be orthologous with farnesene
synthases from loblolly pine and Norway spruce in the
TPS-d1 clade.
Functional characterization of diterpene synthases

Two paralogous diterpene synthases, PsTPS-LAS and
PsTPS-Iso, were characterized in Sitka spruce (Tables 2
and 3, Figure 4). These TPSs shared 90% identity and
they are the orthologues of levopimaradiene/abietadiene
synthase (PaTPS-LAS) and isopimaradiene synthase
(PaTPS-Iso) from Norway spruce [14] (Figure 1). They
belong to the TPS-d3 clade of the gymnosperm TPS-d
family. PsTPS-LAS produced a similar multi-product
profile as its ortholog in Norway spruce, composed of
abietadiene (49%), levopimaradiene (24%), neoabietadiene (23%), and palustradiene (4%). In contrast to the

Page 10 of 14

single-product isopimaradiene synthase from Norway
spruce [14], Sitka spruce PsTPS-Iso produced minor
amounts of sandaracopimaradiene (2%) in addition to
isopimaradiene (98%) (Table 2, Figure 4). PsTPS-Iso is
the first gymnosperm TPS identified to naturally produce sandaracopimaradiene, albeit in minor amounts.
An ent-sandaracopimaradiene synthase has been characterized in rice [46].
PsTPS-LAS and PsTPS-Iso play an important role in
the overall diterpene resin acid defence systems of Sitka
spruce. The six products of the two Sitka spruce diterpene synthases are present as the corresponding diterpene resin acids in the oleoresin of Sitka spruce stem
tissues [29]. Accumulation of all of these diterpene resin
acids was induced by MeJA treatment or insect attack,
along with increased transcript levels detected with the
orthologous PaTPS-LAS and PaTPS-Iso probes [29].
The sequences of PsTPS-LAS and PaTPS-LAS differed
by only 12 amino acids, and PsTPS-Iso and PaTPS-Iso
differed by only 35 amino acids. In a detailed investigation of the PaTPS-LAS and PaTPS-Iso enzymes, using
reciprocal site-directed mutagenesis and domainswapping, we have recently shown that four amino acid
residues determine the different product profiles of
these Norway spruce diterpene synthases [24]. These
product-determining residues are identical between the
levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthases (PsTPS-LAS and
PaTPS-LAS) in Sitka and Norway spruce, consistent
with their similar product profiles. However, only three
of these residues are identical between the isopimaradiene synthases (PsTPS-Iso and PaTPS-Iso) in Sitka and
Norway spruce; the fourth residue (V732) is the same
as that found in the Norway spruce levopimaradiene/
abietadiene synthase. In our previous study [24], the
corresponding reciprocal L725V mutation obtained by
site-directed mutagenesis of PaTPS-Iso resulted in the
formation of sandaracopimaradiene as a minor product.
This product profile change is consistent with the new
observation that the isopimaradiene synthase from Sitka
spruce (PsTPS-Iso) naturally produced sandaracopimaradiene as a minor compound (Table 2, Figure 4).
Overall, these results highlight how mutations produced
in the laboratory that determine product profile differences also exist in nature and do result in the evolution
of altered TPS product profiles between species or
genotypes.
Phylogeny of gymnosperm TPSs

All known conifer TPSs of specialized (i.e., secondary)
metabolism are members of the gymnosperm-specific
TPS-d subfamily, which is a distinct clade of the larger
plant TPS gene family [47]. The TPS-d subfamily has
been subdivided into three clades TPS-d1 through TPSd3 based on a previous phylogeny of 29 gymnosperm

Keeling et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:43
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/43

TPSs [14]. Here, we have substantially expanded the
phylogeny of functionally characterized gymnosperm
TPSs to a total of 72 members (Figure 1), of which 41
are from spruce species with 20 different TPSs from
Sitka spruce. The number of TPSs functionally characterized in Sitka spruce is one of the largest for any species, but is not yet approaching our in silico minimum
estimate for the number of TPSs in a spruce genome (at
least 69 transcriptionally active TPS genes). The diverse
set of newly characterized spruce TPSs broadly represent the major TPS-d1, TPS-d2 and TPS-d3 clades, and
allowed us to identify groups of likely orthologous TPS
genes across the spruce species. Examples for such
groups of orthologous TPSs in the TPS-d1 clade are the
(-)-a/b-pinene synthases, the (-)-linalool synthases, (E,
E)-a-farnesene synthases; in the TPS-d2 clade are the
longifolene synthases; and in the TPS-d3 clade are the
levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthases and isopimaradiene synthases. These groups represent genes whose
functions had apparently evolved prior to speciation of
the spruce genus. In the TPS-d3 group of conifer diterpene synthases, the basal function of a multi-product
levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase had apparently
evolved prior to conifer speciation, as this function
exists in a group of closely related genes from the genera Abies, Pinus and Picea.
Overall, the large diversity of gene functions among
the many closely related genes of the conifer TPS-d1
group illustrates the many events of gene duplications
and sub- or neo-functionalizations that have occurred in
the evolution of this amazing family of conifer genes of
specialized metabolism. The functionally identified
spruce TPS genes account for many of the major and
minor terpenoid compounds of the defensive oleoresin
and volatile emissions. However, there are several distinct types of TPSs still to be found in spruce based
upon the terpenoid components identified in oleoresin.
Based on the current phylogeny of functionally characterized spruce TPSs, we predict that most of the
remaining TPSs to be identified will be highly similar in
sequence to previously identified TPS, but with the possibility of diverse function due to relatively minor
sequence divergence.
In contrast to the many duplicated TPS-d genes of
terpenoid specialized metabolism, the related spruce
TPS genes of general gibberellin phytohormone biosynthesis, specifically ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase
(TPS-c) and ent-kaurene synthase (TPS-e), appear to be
expressed as single copy genes [12]. These primary
metabolism TPS genes are basal to the specialized metabolism genes and are the descendants of an ancestral
plant diterpene synthase similar to the one found in the
non-vascular plant Physcomitrella patens [12,48]. The
mechanisms that suppress manifestation or retention of

Page 11 of 14

TPS gene duplication in diterpenoid primary metabolism and those that enhance TPS gene duplication and
functional diversification in specialized metabolism in a
conifer genome are not known but are worthy of future
investigation. The high functional plasticity of the TPS-d
family and the great diversity of terpenoids produced
may impart fitness advantages against a multitude of
pests and pathogens. We speculate that the TPS-d genes
of specialized metabolism originating from gene duplication are slower, or less likely, to become inactive pseudogenes compared to those genes with less functional
plasticity in primary metabolism.

Conclusions
Based upon estimates from EST and FLcDNA sequencing in three species of spruce, the TPS gene family in
conifers appears to be at least of comparable size to
those found in angiosperms with sequenced genomes.
This study highlights the great diversity of TPSs of specialized metabolism in conifers, which resulted from
gene duplication and functional diversification.
Functional differences can occur naturally due to small
differences in amino acid sequence.
Methods
In silico identification of spruce terpene synthases in the
EST and FLcDNA databases

Quality trimmed and filtered nucleotide sequences were
obtained from spruce genomic resources developed in
the Genome Canada-funded Treenomix (http://www.
treenomix.ca) and Arborea (http://www.arborea.ulaval.
ca) projects as follows: white spruce (242,931 ESTs),
Sitka spruce (174,384 ESTs), and hybrid white spruce
(also referred to as interior spruce; 26,350 ESTs) [15,16].
Conifer TPS protein sequences available from NCBI
were used to query the three species-specific databases
using the tBLASTn module of WU-BLAST 2.0 and an
E-value cut off of 1 × 10-5. The resulting outputs were
filtered to exclude duplicates, and then assembled separately by species using CAP3 [49] using an overlap of 40
bp and a percent identity of 95%. The assembled TPS
candidate sequences were then tentatively annotated
using NCBI BLASTx using the nr database (downloaded
Oct. 2008).
Selection of FLcDNA clones for functional characterization

Authentic cDNA clones corresponding to the aboveidentified TPS candidate sequences were examined
further by restriction digest, colony PCR, and/or sequencing. Those clones that potentially contained a full-length
TPS cDNA (i.e. complete ORF) were fully sequenced and
if a unique full-ORF TPS was found, the insert was subcloned for expression as described below. In one case,
two full ORFs (WS00725_G07c1, WS00725_G07c2) were

Keeling et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:43
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/43

obtained by 5’-RACE and the full-length genes were subsequently cloned into pCR Blunt II TOPO (Invitrogen).
Cloning of PsTPS-Iso

Because of our particular interest in conifer diTPSs
[12,24] and the low abundance of putative diTPSs in the
ESTs, we chose to isolate an isopimaradiene synthase
(PsTPS-Iso) cDNA from Sitka spruce using homologybased cloning to allow functional comparison with its
putative levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase paralog
(PsTPS-LAS, WS0299_C21, described here). Examination
of the spruce EST resources [15,16] identified a 3’-read
for clone WS00752_D05 from white spruce with high
similarity to the isopimaradiene synthase from Norway
spruce (PaTPS-Iso; [14]). Full sequencing of this cDNA
clone indicated that it was an incomplete transcript.
Using PCR with primers designed for the 3’-UTR of this
sequence and the 5’-UTR of WS0299_C21, we amplified
a 2,700 bp cDNA from the bark of methyl jasmonatetreated Sitka spruce (genotype Haney 898). The amplicon was cloned into pCR Blunt II TOPO and fully
sequenced (PsTPS-Iso, pSW06061903).
Expression and purification of recombinant TPS enzymes

TPS cDNAs were amplified using proof-reading polymerase (Phusion, Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) and subcloned into NdeI/HindIII-digested pET28b(+) (Novagen)
using a sticky-end PCR approach [50], or via topoisomerase-mediated insertion into pET100 TOPO/D or
pET200 TOPO/D (Invitrogen). All resulting recombinant proteins were full-length and N-terminally Histagged. Expression constructs were fully sequence
verified.
Plasmids were transformed into chemically competent
C41 E. coli cells (http://www.overexpress.com) containing the pRARE 2 plasmid (coding for rare tRNAs) prepared from Novagen Rosetta 2 cells (EMD Biosciences,
Inc., Madison, WI, USA). Luria-Bertani medium (5 mL)
containing appropriate antibiotics was inoculated with
three individual colonies and cultured overnight at 37°C,
220 rpm. Terrific Broth medium (50 mL) containing
appropriate antibiotics was then inoculated with 0.5 mL
of the overnight culture and grown in a 250 mL baffle
flask at 37°C and 300 rpm until an optical density at
600 nm of at least 0.8 was reached. Cultures were then
cooled to 16°C, induced with 0.2 mM IPTG, and then
cultured for approximately 16-20 h at 16°C and
220 rpm before pelleting and freezing.
Cell pellets were resuspended, lysed, and sonicated in
(1.5 mL g-1 pellet) ice cold 20 mM NaPO4, 500 mM NaCl,
30 mM imidazole, 0.04 mg mL-1 DNase, 1 mM MgCl2,
5 mM PMSF, and 0.5 mg mL-1 lysozyme, pH 7.4 and then
clarified by centrifugation (30 min, 12,000 × g, 4°C). The
cleared lysates were applied to His SpinTrap Ni-affinity

Page 12 of 14

columns (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and eluted
with 20 mM NaPO4, 500 mM NaCl, and 500 mM imidazole, pH 7.4 at 4°C following the manufacturer’s protocol.
Purified enzymes were desalted at 4°C into 25 mM HEPES
pH 7.2, 100 mM KCl, and 10% glycerol using PD MiniTrap G-25 desalting columns (GE Healthcare) and then
used immediately for enzyme assays.
Enzyme assays and gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GCMS) analyses

Single-vial enzyme assays were completed in triplicate in
2 mL amber glass GC sample vials as previously
described [51] in three different buffer/substrate combinations with approximately 60 μg of purified protein per
500 μL assay. Buffers consisted of: monoTPS assays;
25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mM KCl, 10 mM MnCl2,
5 mM fresh DTT, 10% glycerol, and 51 μM GPP (geranyl diphosphate, Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON); sesquiTPS assays; 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 10 mM MgCl2,
5 mM fresh DTT, 10% glycerol, and 43 μM FPP ((E,E)farnesyl diphosphate, Sigma-Aldrich); diTPS assays;
50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mM KCl, 7.5 mM MgCl2,
20 μM MnCl 2 , 5 mM fresh DTT, 5% glycerol, and
37 μM GGPP ((E,E,E)-geranylgeranyl diphosphate,
Sigma-Aldrich). Assays were overlaid with 500 μL of
pentane and incubated at 30°C for 90 min after which
they were vortexed for 30 s to denature the proteins
and extract the products into the pentane layer. To
completely separate the phases prior to GCMS analysis,
samples were frozen at -80°C and then the vials were
centrifuged for 30 min at 1,000 × g at 4°C.
Assay products were analyzed on an Agilent HP-5ms
column (5% phenyl methyl siloxane, 30 m × 250 μm ID,
0.25 μm film) at 1 mL min-1 He on an Agilent 6890N gas
chromatograph, 7683B series autosampler (vertical syringe position of 8 to sample the pentane layer), and 5975
Inert XL MS Detector. GC temperature program as follows: 40°C, hold 1 min, 7.5°C min-1 to 250°C, hold 2 min,
pulsed splitless injector held at 250°C. Samples were also
analyzed on an Agilent DB-WAX column (polyethylene
glycol, 30 m × 250 μm ID, 0.25 μm film) with the following temperature program: 40°C, hold 3 min, 10°C min-1
to 240°C, hold 15 min, pulsed splitless injector held at
240°C. Compounds were identified by comparison of
mass spectra and retention indices with authentic standards if available, and retention indices, and/or mass
spectra from Adams [52] and NIST, and combined mass
spectra and retention index library searches in MassFinder [53] if standards were not available.
When possible, stereochemistry of enzyme products
were compared to authentic chiral standards on an Agilent Cyclodex B column (permethylated b-cyclodextrin in
DB 1701 ((14%-cyanopropyl-phenyl)-methylpolysiloxane), 30 m × 250 μm ID, 0.25 μm film) with the following

Molecular modelling

We used Deep View/Swiss-PDBViewer (Mac version
3.9.1b) and SWISS-MODEL [55-57] to develop a 3D
homology model of WS00725_G07c1 truncated at Q63
based on the structure of limonene synthase from Mentha
spicata containing the substrate analogue 2-fluorogeranyl
diphosphate (Protein Data Bank 2ONGB) [35].
List of abbreviations
TPS: terpene synthase; EST: expressed sequence tag; FLcDNA: full-length
cDNA; GPP: geranyl diphosphate; FPP: farnesyl diphosphate; GGPP:
geranylgeranyl diphosphate; GC: gas chromatography; MS: mass
spectrometry; ORF: open reading frame; MeJA: methyl jasmonate; gene and
enzyme names abbreviations are shown in Table 3.
