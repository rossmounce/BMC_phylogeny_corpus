Novel histone deacetylase inhibitors in clinical
trials as anti-cancer agents
Jiahuai Tan1, Shundong Cang2, Yuehua Ma3, Richard L Petrillo1, Delong Liu3*

Abstract
Histone deacetylases (HDACs) can regulate expression of tumor suppressor genes and activities of transcriptional
factors involved in both cancer initiation and progression through alteration of either DNA or the structural components of chromatin. Recently, the role of gene repression through modulation such as acetylation in cancer
patients has been clinically validated with several inhibitors of HDACs. One of the HDAC inhibitors, vorinostat, has
been approved by FDA for treating cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) for patients with progressive, persistent, or
recurrent disease on or following two systemic therapies. Other inhibitors, for example, FK228, PXD101, PCI-24781,
ITF2357, MGCD0103, MS-275, valproic acid and LBH589 have also demonstrated therapeutic potential as monotherapy or combination with other anti-tumor drugs in CTCL and other malignancies. At least 80 clinical trials are
underway, testing more than eleven different HDAC inhibitory agents including both hematological and solid
malignancies. This review focuses on recent development in clinical trials testing HDAC inhibitors as anti-tumor
agents.
Background
Histones are among the most evolutionarily conserved
proteins and the most abundant proteins bound to
DNA in eukaryotic cells [1]. There are a total of five
classes of them (H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) organized
into two groups: core histones (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4)
and linker histone (H1). Two each of the core histones
form nucleosome particle by wrapping 147 base pairs of
DNA. Histone H1, as a linker, binds nucleosomes
together and thus participates in a higher-order of histones as chromatin [2-4]. Chromatin undergoes modifications by changing its structure and chemical
composition as cells differentiate, subsequently lead to
diverse patterns of gene expression and differences in
cellular function [5]. Such post-translational modifications are called epigenetic processes and are inheritable
changes in gene expression without alteration of the
nucleotide sequence [6]. These modifications in the
chromatin including genomic DNA and histones or
other chromatin-associated proteins comprise the addition of methyl, acetyl, and phosphoryl groups or even
larger moieties such as binding of ubiquitin or small
ubiquitin-like modifier [7,8]. Out of all the modifications

above, histone acetylation is the most widely studied and
has been shown to have diverse roles in the regulation
of the nucleosome. Lysine acetylation, for example, can
lead to changes in chromatin structure and may
decrease the histone-DNA interaction and promote
accessibility of the DNA for transcription activation [9].
The abnormal activation and deactivation of transcription based on histone acetylation status may be associated with tumorigenesis [10]. Several lines of evidence
indicated that HDACs are associated with a number of
well-characterized cellular oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes leading to development of many specific
forms of malignancy [11,12].
In the eukaryotic cells, 18 different HDACs are identified and they may reside either in the nucleus or in the
cytoplasm [13,14]. According to phylogenetic analyses
and sequence homologies with yeast proteins, HDACs
can be divided into four classes. Class I family of
HDACs consists of 1, 2, 3 and 8 proteins. They are
similar to yeast HDACs and locate in the nucleus of the
cells exclusively [15,16]. Class II family members include
4, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10, which are related to Hos3 in yeast.
They primarily localize in the cytoplasm, but can transfer to nucleus from cytoplasm [17,18]. Class I and II of
HDACs are evolutionarily related and share a common
enzymatic mechanism, the Zn-catalyzed hydrolysis of

the acetyl-lysine amide bond [19]. HDAC11 is located in
both cytoplasm and nucleus and belongs to class IV
[20]. It has a conserved domain in the catalytic region
and shares features with both class I and II. The class
III of HDACs is the so-called Sirts, consisting of seven
members. These proteins are similar to Sirts in yeast.
They are different with previous groups and are Znindependent and dependent on NAD as a cofactor [21].
Inhibitors of HDACs were found to have anti-cancer
function as a novel therapeutic class of drugs in many
different cancers [22-26]. Based on their chemical structure, these inhibitors can be subdivided into four different classes, including hydroxamates, cyclic peptides,
aliphatic acids and benzamides [27]. TSA, a compound
of hydroxamates, is the first nature product that has
been discovered to possess the HDAC inhibitor activity
in1990. Its structural analog, suberoyl anilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) was the first approved HDAC inhibitor for clinical treatment of T cell lymphoma. Other
compounds, for example, CBHA [28,29] and LBH589
[30-32], have been used in pre- and clinical trials in this
group. Another class of HDAC inhibitors is aliphatic
acid, including Valproic acid (VPA) [33-35], phenylbutyrate [36]. The third group is benzamide consisted of
MS-275 [25,37-41] and MGCD0103 [42-45]. The last
group is cyclic peptide including FK-228 [46-50].
Although not fully understood, the clinical activity of
these inhibitors is thought to be mediated in part by
induction of histone acetylation, resulting in a permissive or more open chromatin configuration and potential reactivation of aberrantly suppressed genes resulting
in growth arrest, cell differentiation, and apoptosis of
tumor cells [51-55]. The patterns of alterations of gene
expression are similar for different HDAC inhibitors,
but show definite differences induced by different agents
in various transformed cells [56-58]. Functionally,
HDACs regulate gene expression by at least three
mechanisms [59]. First of all, histone deacetylation
increases the charge density on the N-termini of the
core histones, thereby strengthening histone tail-DNA
interactions and blocking access of the transcriptional
machinery to the DNA template. In addition, histone
modifications are specifically recognized by chromatininteracting proteins [14]. A consequence of this alteration in nucleosome conformation is reduced accessibility
of the transcriptional regulatory machinery to the DNA
template, resulting in transcriptional repression [60-63].
A second mechanism by which HDACs regulate transcription is by catalyzing the deacetylation of sequencespecific DNA binding transcription factors. Acetylation
and deacetylation of sequence-specific transcription factors can either increase or decrease their DNA binding
activity, and subsequently may enhance or repress transcription [64-68]. Furthermore, a number of cytoplasmic

proteins, including tubulin and HSP90, have now been
shown to be acetylated by HDAC [69-73]
One of the HDAC inhibitors, vorinostat, has been
approved by FDA for treating cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) for patients with progressive, persistent,
or recurrent disease on or following two systemic therapies. Other inhibitors, for example, FK228, PXD101,
PCI-24781, ITF2357, MGCD0103, MS-275, valproic acid
and LBH589 have also demonstrated therapeutic potential as monotherapy or combination with other antitumor drugs in CTCL and other malignancies. At least
80 clinical trials are underway, testing more than eleven
different HDAC inhibitory agents including both hematological and solid malignancies. Vorinostat clinical trials
have been updated lately [13,74]. This review focuses on
recent development in clinical trials testing newer
HDAC inhibitors as anti-tumor agents.
PCI-24781

PCI-24781 (formerly CRA-024781) is a broad-spectrum
phenyl hydroxamic acid. It has been evaluated alone or
with ionizing radiation and other DNA-damaging agents
in pre-clinical studies [75]. Recent pre-clinical data have
suggested that it may act, in part, by inhibiting DNA
repair resulted in a synergistic effect on apoptosis when
combined with other agents [76,77]. Phase I clinical trial
in refractory advanced solid tumor patients showed that
PCI-24781 was well tolerated following intravenous or
oral administration. Adverse events included anemia,
thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, and vomiting. Only one patient in the final cohort had asymptomatic non-specific ST- T wave changes and had drug
discontinued. These were not dose-related. Mean oral
bioavailability was 0.28 (34%) with no difference
between solution and capsule. Tubulin and histone acetylation were documented in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Acetylation levels increased at 1.5 h
post dose and were sustained through 4 h in all patients.
Stable disease up to 8 cycles was seen in 5 of 13 evaluable patients [78].
ITF2357

ITF2357 is a synthesized HDAC inhibitor containing a
hydroxamic acid moiety linked to an aromatic ring.
Many reports demonstrated that it has inhibitory activity
in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well
as cytotoxic activity both in vitro on several human
tumor cell lines and in vivo in patients with hematologic
malignancies [79-83]. A phase II open label non randomized study was done at the National Tumor Institute
of Milan using the drug as third-line or higher treatment of heavily pretreated, relapsed or refractory, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients. Toxicity included: grade 1
leukopenia in 30%, grade 2 thrombocytopenia in 33%,
fatigue in 50%, grade 1 diarrhea and/or abdominal pain
in 40%; prolongation of QTc interval prompting

transient drug discontinuation in 20%. Thirteen patients
completed at least one cycle of therapy and were evaluated for response. Seven patients (54%) had stable disease by CT scan that was associated with a significant
reduction in FDG-PET uptake in 6 patients (46%) lasting a median of 3 months. Six patients had progression
of disease (POD). Preliminary results in this series of
very heavily pretreated HL patients showed that oral
ITF 2357 has anti-tumor activity and a good safety profile. The drug warrants additional studies, alone and in
combination, as salvage treatment for HL even with less
advanced disease [84].
MS-275 (SNDX-275)

MS-275 is a synthetic benzamide derivative that has
been shown to inhibit HDACs, and has anti-tumor
activity in many preclinical models [25,85-88]. Clinical
trial with this agent was first done in the patients with
advanced solid tumors or lymphoma in 2005 (Table 1).
They were treated with MS-275 orally initially on a
once daily Ã 28 every 6 weeks schedule. The starting
dose was 2 mg/m2 and the dose was escalated in threeto six-patient cohorts based on toxicity assessments.
With the daily schedule, the maximum tolerated dose
(MTD) was exceeded at the first dose level. Therefore,
once every 14 days schedule was implemented and
found reasonably well tolerated. The MTD was 10 mg/
m 2 and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were nausea,
vomiting, anorexia, and fatigue. HDAC inhibition was
observed in PBMCs. Preliminary pharmacokinetics (PK)
analysis suggested the half-life of MS-275 in humans
was 39 to 80 hours, substantially longer than predicted
by preclinical studies. Based on PK data, a more frequent dosing schedule, weekly Ã 4, repeated every 6
weeks is being evaluated [89]. A total of 22 patients
were enrolled on this schedule, and 19 were considered
evaluable for toxicity. The MTD was 6 mg/m 2 . No
grade 4 toxicities were observed. DLTs were reversible
and consisted of hypophosphatemia, hyponatremia, and
hypoalbuminemia. MS-275 was found to be well tolerated at a dose of 6 mg/m 2 administered weekly with
food for 4 weeks cycled every 6 weeks [90].
Three additional dose schedules were also studied:
once every other week, twice weekly for 3 weeks every

28 days, and once weekly for 3 weeks every 28 days.
MS-275 was confirmed to be safe and well tolerated at
doses up to 6 mg/m 2 every other week or 4 mg/m 2
weekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest. These
two schedules resulted in biologically relevant plasma
concentrations and anti-tumor activity. Levels of histone
H3 and H4 acetylation in PBMCs increased. Two of 27
patients showed partial remissions (PR), including one
patient with metastatic melanoma who had a PR and
has remained on study for >5 years. Six patients showed
prolonged disease stabilization (SD). Twice-weekly dosing was not tolerable due to asthenia, and further evaluation of this schedule was halted. The recommended
dose for further disease-focused studies is 4 mg/m 2
given weekly for 3 weeks every 28 days or 2 to 6 mg/m2
given once every other week [91].
Phase 1 study in advanced acute leukemias also
demonstrated that MS-275 was safe and can be tolerated at doses up to 8 mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks every 6
weeks. The patients were treated with MS-275 initially
once weekly Ã 2, repeated every 4 weeks from 4 to 8
mg/m2, and after 13 patients were treated, once weekly
Ã 4, repeated every 6 weeks from 8 to 10 mg/m2. DLTs
included infections and neurologic toxicity manifesting
as unsteady gait and somnolence. Other frequent nonDLTs were fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, hypoalbuminemia, and hypocalcaemia. Histone H3/H4 acetylation, p21 expression, and caspase-3 activation can be
induced by MS-275 in bone marrow mononuclear cells.
Even though MS-275 effectively inhibits HDAC in vivo
in patients with advanced myeloid leukemias, responses
by classical criteria were not seen [92].
Pre-clinical studies suggested that combining inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT), 5-azacitidine
(AZA), with inhibitors of HDAC, SNDX-275, synergistically induced re-expression of epigenetically-silenced
tumor suppressor genes and had anti-tumor effect. Clinical study revealed it safe and well tolerated in 10
patients with advanced non small cell lung carcinoma
(NSCLC). AZA was given subcutaneously on days 1-6
and 8-10 with SNDX-275 (MS-275) at a fixed dose of 7
mg/day on days 3 and 10 of a 28 day cycle. No DLT
was seen in the 30 mg/m2 dose cohort. At 40 mg/m2,

one subject was replaced due to rapidly progressive disease during week 1. One subject experienced a hematologic DLT (grade 3 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia).
No long term adverse outcomes from the DLT were
seen. Common low grade toxicities included injection
site reactions, nausea/vomiting, constipation, fatigue,
and cytopenias. A major and durable PR has been
observed in one patient, which is ongoing at >8 months.
Two patients had stable diseases through â¥2 cycles of
therapy; the remaining patients had PODs. This clinical
trial showed that AZA and SNDX-275 combination may
have clinical activity in advanced NSCLC patients after
failing at least one previous chemotherapy regimen [93].
Depsipeptide (romidepsin, FK228, FR901228)

Depsipeptide (FR901228) is a bicyclic peptide isolated
from Chromobacterium Violaceum and has demonstrated potent in vitro cytotoxic activity against human
tumor cell lines and in vivo efficacy against human
tumor xenografts. Sander et al first studied 37 patients
with advanced or refractory neoplasm by utilizing depsipeptide by a 4-h intravenous infusion on days 1 and 5
of a 21-day cycle in 2002 (Table 2). DLT included
grade-3 fatigue (3 patients), grade-3 nausea and vomiting (1 patient), grade-4 thrombocytopenia (2 patients),
and grade-4 cardiac arrhythmia (1 patient, atrial fibrillation). Reversible ECG changes with ST/T wave flattening were regularly observed. There were no clinically
significant changes in left ventricular ejection fraction.
The recommended Phase II dose is 17.8 mg/m2 administered on day 1 and 5 of a 21-day cycle. One patient
obtained a PR [94]. Other clinical study done in the
similar population confirmed that depsipeptide can be
safely administered when given as a 4-hour infusion and
further clinical trials are warranted [95].

Page 4 of 13

Patients with refractory renal cell cancer were enrolled
on a multi-institutional, single-arm, phase II study.
Patients received depsipeptide at 13 mg/m2 intravenously over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day
cycle with disease reevaluation performed every 8 weeks.
The most common serious toxicities were fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and anemia. Two patients developed a
prolonged QT interval, one patient each developed
grade 3 atrial fibrillation and tachycardia, and there was
1 sudden death. Two patients experienced an objective
response for an overall response rate (ORR) of 7% (95%
CI, 0.8%-23%). Depsipeptide at this dose and schedule
was concluded to have insufficient activity for further
investigation in this patient population [96].
Clinical trial in lung cancer exhibited minimal clinical
efficacy. Nineteen patients with lung cancer refractory
to standard therapy received 4-h depsipeptide infusions
(17.8 mg/m2) on days 1 and 7 of a 21-day cycle. Each
full course of therapy consisted of two identical 21-day
cycles. Nineteen patients were evaluated for toxicity
assessment; 18 were evaluated for treatment response.
Myelosuppression was dose limiting in one individual.
No significant cardiac toxicities were observed. Maximum steady-state plasma depsipeptide concentrations
ranged from 384 to 1114 ng/mL. No objective responses
were observed. Transient SD was noted in nine patients.
It may warrant further evaluation of this HDAC inhibitor in combination with novel-targeted agents in lung
cancer patients [97].
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells can be induced by depsipeptide into apoptosis in vitro. Clinical trial was done in
ten patients with CLL and 10 patients with AML who
were treated with 13 mg/m2 depsipeptide intravenously

on days 1, 8, and 15. Neither life-threatening toxicities
nor cardiac toxicities were noted, although the majority
of patients experienced progressive fatigue, nausea, and
other constitutional symptoms that prevented repeated
dosing. Depsipeptide effectively inhibits HDAC in vivo
in patients with CLL and AML. Several patients had evidence of anti-tumor activity following treatment, but no
PRs or complete responses (CRs) were noted. HDAC
inhibition and histone acetylation increases of at least
100% were noted. Its use in the current schedule of
administration is limited mainly by progressive constitutional symptoms [98]. Another study of depsipeptide
was done in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome
(MDS) or AML at a dose of 18 mg/m2 intravenously on
days 1 and 5 every 3 weeks. Twelve patients (nine with
AML, three with MDS) received one to five cycles of
depsipeptide. The most common grade 3/4 toxicities
were febrile neutropenia/infection (five patients), neutropenia/thrombocytopenia (nine patients), nausea (nine
patients), and asymptomatic hypophosphatemia (three
patients). No clinically significant cardiac toxicity was
observed. One of 11 assessed patients achieved CRs, six
in SDs, and four in PODs. The results showed that depsipeptide therapy can be administered with acceptable
short-term toxicity. Depsipeptide monotherapy however
appears to have limited clinical activity in unselected
AML/MDS patients [99].
Another phase I trial of depsipeptide was done following
a new schedule. It was administered on days 1, 3 and 5 to
a group of twenty six patients with radioactive iodine
(RAI)-refractory thyroid cancer. No grade 4 toxicities were
observed. Eleven patients had SDs for a median of 28
weeks. Four patients have undergone follow up RAI scans;
none had increased RAI uptake. The MTD was reached
on this new schedule. This protocol is open exclusively for
patients with RAI-refractory thyroid cancer [100].
The combination of depsipeptide and gemcitabine was
evaluated in patients with advanced solid tumors. Depsipeptide was administered as a 4 hour infusion followed
by gemcitabine over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of a
28 day cycle. Thirty-three patients (9 pancreatic, 8 breast,
7 NSCLC, 3 ovarian, 6 other) have received 104+ cycles
(median 2, range 1 - 8). Nonhematologic toxicities have
been mild to moderate. These consisted primarily of nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. One patient with ovarian cancer experienced a minor response (29%) and 12 patients
experienced SDs after â¥ 4 cycles. The phase II dose (depsipeptide 12 mg/m2 and gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 every
other week) is being expanded to further assess the safety
and activity of the regimen [101].
Panobinostat (LBH589)

LBH589, a novel hydroxamate analog HDAC inhibitor,
has been shown to induce acetylation of histone H3 and
H4, increase p21 levels, disrupt the chaperone function

Page 5 of 13

of hsp90, and induce cell-cycle G1 phase accumulation
and apoptosis of K562 cells and acute leukemia MV4-11
cells [102]. The anti-tumor effect by LBH589 was also
demonstrated in multiple myeloma, NSCLC as well as
castrate-resistant prostate cancer cell lines [30,103-107].
The first clinical trial was done in the patients with
hematological malignancy. LBH589 was administered
intravenously as a 30-minute infusion on days 1 to 7 of
a 21-day cycle (Table 3). Fifteen patients with AML,
acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), or MDS were treated
with LBH589 at the following dose levels (mg/m2): 4.8
to 14. The DLTs (grade 3 QTcF prolongation) were
observed in four at 14.0 mg/m2. QTcF prolongation was
asymptomatic and reversed on LBH589 discontinuation.
Other potentially LBH589-related toxicities included
nausea (40%), diarrhea (33%), vomiting (33%), hypokalemia (27%), loss of appetite (13%), and thrombocytopenia
(13%). In 8 of 11 patients with peripheral blasts, transient blast cell reductions occurred with a rebound following the 7-day treatment period. H3 and H2B
acetylation increase was significant in B-cells and blasts.
Intravenous administration of LBH589 was well tolerated at doses <11.5 mg/m2 with consistent antileukemic
and biological effects [108].
The patients with CTCL (stage IB-IVA) were enrolled
in an open-label clinical trial study to measure the safety
and toxicity of LBH589. Patients included Mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sezary syndrome (SS), who have failed
â¥2 prior systemic therapies. Patients were assigned to
two different groups: Group 1 previously treated with
oral bexarotene or Group 2 without bexarotene. Panobinostat (20 mg) was administered orally on days 1, 3, and
5 weekly until disease progression or intolerance. Most
common (>15%) side effects include diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, asthenia, hypertriglyceridaemia, dysgeusia, nausea and pruritus. Intensive ECG monitoring
for QTc prolongation was performed. Among 1578
ECGs analyzed, there has been no QTc >500 ms, one
QTc >480 ms, and one QTc >60 ms increased from
baseline. Best overall response is PR for 3 patients, SD
for 4 patients. Preliminary safety data suggest that panobinostat is generally well tolerated [109]. Microarray
data showed that panobinostat induced distinct gene
expression profiles over time following treatment, with
the majority of genes being repressed. Panobinostat
regulated twenty-three common genes in all patients
tested. A unique set of genes that can mediate biological
responses such as apoptosis, immune regulation, and
angiogenesis were commonly regulated in response to
panobinostat. These genes are strong candidates for the
future assessment of their functional role in mediating
the anti-tumor responses of panobinostat [105].
HDAC inhibitors can block androgen receptor
-mediated transcriptional activation of many genes and

thus may result in possible benefit in treating Castration-resistant prostate cancer [110]. Docetaxel is first
line therapy for patient with castration-resistant prostate
cancer [111]. Phase I Clinical study with oral panobinostat alone or in combination with docetaxel in castration-resistant prostate cancer showed that oral
panobinostat with and without docetaxel is feasible and
a drug-drug interaction is not apparent. 16 patients
were enrolled in this study. DLTs include dyspnea and
neutropenia. Three patients achieved a PR as best
response. Two of these three patients elected to hold
treatment due to fatigue. All evaluable patients at the 20
mg single agent dose (7/7) demonstrated accumulation
of acetylated histones in monocytes [112].
MGCD0103

MGCD0103 is a novel isotype-selective inhibitor of
human HDACs with the potential to regulate aberrant
gene expression and restore normal growth control in
malignancies. A phase I trial of MGCD0103, given as a
three-times-per-week oral dose for 2 of every 3 weeks,
was performed in patients with advanced solid tumors
(Table 4). DLTs consisting of fatigue, nausea, vomiting,
anorexia, and dehydration were observed in three (27%)
of 11 and two (67%) of three patients treated at the 45
and 56 mg/m 2 /d dose levels, respectively. SD was
observed after four or more cycles of treatments in five
(16%) of 32 patients assessable for efficacy. PK analyses
demonstrated inter-patient variability which was
improved by co-administration with low pH beverages.
Elimination half-life ranged from 6.7 to 12.2 hours, and
no accumulation was observed with repeated dosing.
Pharmacodynamic (PD) evaluations confirmed inhibition
of HDAC activity and induction of acetylation of H3 histones in peripheral WBCs from patients by MGCD0103.
The recommended phase II dose was 45 mg/m2/day. At
doses evaluated, MGCD0103 appears to be tolerable and
exhibits favorable PK and PD profiles with evidence of
target inhibition in surrogate tissues [113].
MGCD0103 was also studied in patients with leukemia and MDS. Patients were treated with 3 times weekly

schedule without interruption in this phase I study. The
MTD was 60 mg/m2, with DLTs of fatigue, nausea,
vomiting, and diarrhea observed at higher doses. Three
patients achieved a complete bone marrow response. PK
analyses indicated absorption of MGCD0103 within 1
hour and an elimination half-life in plasma of 9 (+/- 2)
hours. In summary, MGCD0103 was well tolerated and
had antileukemia activity [114].
MGCD0103 combined with gemcitabine had demonstrated more effective anti-tumor activity than alone in
pre-clinical studies. Phase I/II study with MGCD0103
alone or combination with gemcitabine were done in
patients with solid tumors recently. Phase I part of the
trial studied adults with refractory solid tumors. Phase II
part of the trial was limited to gemcitabine naive
patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic
cancer. Patients received MGCD0103 (3 times a week)
in 28-day cycles at sequential ascending doses using a 3
+3 design targeting a DLT rate of <33%. Gemcitabine
was administered at 1,000 mg/m2, weekly Ã 3 per cycle.
DLTs included fatigue, vomiting and abdominal pain as
well as thrombocytopenia and anemia. Inhibition of
HDAC activity was observed in patientsâ PBMCs. The
MTD and recommended phase II dose was 90 mg.
Among 14 response-evaluable phase I patients, there
were 2 PRs out of 5 pancreatic carcinoma patients and
2 PRs in a patient with nasopharyngeal cancer and a
patient with cutaneous T- cell lymphoma. Two patients
were observed with SD after receiving >2 cycles (1 lung
and 1 pancreatic). The combination may have clinical
activity in patients with solid tumors in general and
pancreatic cancer in particular. Phase II at the dose of
90 mg of MGCD0103 is ongoing in patients with pancreatic cancer [115].
Open-label, phase II trial in adults with relapsed or
refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or
follicular lymphoma (FL) also demonstrated significant
anti-cancer activity with manageable side effect profile.
Fifty patients received treatment; including 33 DLBCL
and 17 FL. Of 17 DLBCL patients with tumor reassessed

by CT, most had tumor reduction, including 1 CR & 3
PRs, with progression free survival (PFS) for responders
ranging from 168 to >336 days. Five DLBCL patients
with stable disease had PFS ranging from 112 to >336
days. One of 10 FL patients achieved PR. The most
common toxicities of grade â¥3 were fatigue (14%), neutropenia (12%), thrombocytopenia (10%), and anemia
(6%) [116].
Since Hodgkinâs lymphoma (HL) patients with
relapsed or refractory disease have poor prognosis, an
open-label, phase II trial in adults with relapsed/refractory HL was conducted. Patients received MGCD0103
at 110 or 85 mg 3 times per week in 4-week cycles.
Among 23 patients in the 110 mg cohort, 21 were evaluated, of whom 2 (10%) had CRs and 6 (29%) had PRs
for an ORR of 38%. The 2 patients with CRs had progression free survival lasting >270 and >420 days,
respectively, with both responses ongoing. One additional patient (5%) had SD >6 cycles. Among 10 patients
in the 85 mg cohort, 5 were evaluated for efficacy, all of
whom had tumor reductions of â¥30%; including 1 PR
and 2 SDs. MGCD0103 demonstrated significant antitumor activity in relapsed/refractory HL [117].
Belinostat (PXD101)

The activity of belinostat was investigated in many cell
lines, which include hepatocellular carcinoma, human
cancer, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, prostate cancer,
bladder cancer, head and neck squamous carcinomas
and ovarian cancer cells in preclinical studies [118-126].
In a phase I clinical trial, forty-six patients with
advanced refractory solid tumors received belinostat at
one of six dose levels (150-1200 mg/m2/d). DLTs were
fatigue, diarrhea, atrial fibrillation; and grade 2 nausea/
vomiting leading to inability to complete a full 5-day
cycle. The MTD was 1000 mg/m2/d. The intermediate
elimination half-life was 0.3 to 1.3 h and was independent of dose. SD was observed in a total of 18 (39%)
patients, including 15 treated for more than 4 cycles. Of
the 24 patients treated at the MTD, 50% achieved SD.

Belinostat exhibits dose-dependent pharmacodynamic
effects, and has promising anti-tumor activity (Table 5)
[127].
Sixteen patients with advanced hematological neoplasms received belinostat in another clinical trial at one
of three dose levels: 600 mg/m 2 /d, 900 mg/m 2 /d and
1000 mg/m 2 /d. The most common treatment-related
adverse events were nausea, vomiting, fatigue and flushing. No grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicity compared
with baseline occurred except one case of grade 3 lymphopenia. There were two grade 4 renal failure. Both
events occurred in patients with multiple myeloma. No
cardiac events were noted. No CRs or PRs were noted
in these heavily pre-treated patients. However, five
patients, including two patients with diffuse large-cell
lymphoma achieved SD after two to nine treatment
cycles. Intravenous belinostat at 600, 900 and 1000 mg/
m2/d was well tolerated. 1000 mg/m2/d on days 1-5 in a
21-d cycle was recommended for phase II studies in
patients with hematological neoplasia [128].
Simultaneously targeting two epigenetic pathways
using belinostat and the DNA hypomethylating agent
azacitidine (AZA) may lead to an additive or synergistic
effect in patients with advanced myeloid neoplasms.
AZA, 75 mg/m2/d, was given subcutaneously on days 15 followed by escalating doses of belinostat given intravenously over 30 minutes on the same days in a 28 day
cycle. Twenty one patients received at least 1 cycle and
are evaluated for response: 2 CRs, 1 PR and 4 with
hematologic improvement. Median time to response was
2 cycles. Increased platelets at 4 weeks were observed in
one-third of patients at all dose levels studied. The combination of belinostat with AZA is feasible. A randomized study was suggested to further investigate the
relative contribution of belinostat to clinical efficacy
[129].
Patients with low malignant potential (LMP) ovarian
tumors represent an understudied population whose
tumors are intrinsically resistant to radiation and

chemotherapy. Patients with platinum resistant epithelial
ovarian cancer (EOC) have low response rates to conventional chemotherapy too. Belinostat demonstrates
anti-tumor activity in ovarian cancer animal models.
Two patient populations, metastatic or recurrent platinum resistant (< 6 mo) EOC and LMP ovarian tumors,
were enrolled to assess the activity of belinostat. Belinostat 1,000 mg/m2/day was administered intravenously on
days 1-5 of a 21 day cycle. The most frequent grade 3
adverse events were bowel obstruction, thrombosis, dyspnea, fatigue, lymphopenia, elevated ALP and nausea.
Eighteen patients with EOC received a total of 50 cycles
of treatment. 9 patients had SDs, 6 PODs, 3 are non
evaluable and 2 remained on study. 12 patients with
LMP tumors received 68 cycles of treatment. 1 patient
had a PR, 9 SDs, and 2 are non evaluable. Belinostat
showed promising activity in LMP ovarian tumors [130].
Thirteen patients with advanced mesothelioma with
progression on one prior chemotherapy regimen have
been recruited to a phase II study using belinostat. SD
was seen in two patients. No objective responses were
noted. One patient died as a consequence of cardiac
arrhythmia. It was concluded that belinostat is not
active as monotherapy against recurrent malignant
pleural mesothelioma. Evaluation of combination strategies was suggested for further development of this novel
agent in mesothelioma [122].
Valproic acid

Valproic acid (VPA) can induce in vitro differentiation of
primary AML blasts in vitro. Seventy five patients with
AML/MDS were enrolled in a clinical trial (Table 6). Of
these, sixty six were started on VPA monotherapy, with
later addition of all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in
patients who did not respond or relapsed. Median treatment duration was 4 months for VPA and 2 months for
ATRA. Hematological improvement was observed in 18
patients (24%). Median response duration was 4 months.
ATRA exerted no additional effect in patients receiving
the combination. However, of ten VPA responders who

relapsed, four achieved a second response after addition
of ATRA. Response rates were strongly dependent on
disease type according to WHO classification. There was
a response rate of 52% in MDS patients with a normal
blast count. The response rate was 6% in refractory anemia with excess blasts (I + II), 16% in AML, and 0% in
chronic myelomonocytic leukemia [131]. Another clinical
study in similar patient population showed that treatment with VPA/ATRA combination results in transient
disease control in a subset of patients with AML that has
evolved from a myeloproliferative disorder but not in
patients with a primary or MDS-related AML [132,133].
In another study of 54 patients with AML/MDS, a fixed
dose of decitabine (15 mg/m 2 by IV daily for 10 days)
was administered concomitantly with escalating doses of
VPA orally for 10 days. A 50 mg/kg daily dose of VPA
was found to be safe. Twelve (22%) patients had objective
response, including 10 (19%) CRs, and 2 (3%) CRs with
incomplete platelet recovery. In summary, this combination of epigenetic therapy in leukemia appears to be safe
and active, and was associated with transient reversal of
aberrant epigenetic marks [134]. However, in a separate
phase I study, encephalopathy was seen in AML patients
treated with VPA plus Low-dose decitabine (20 mg/m2/d
for 10 days) [135].
Soriano et al. conducted a phase I/II study of the
combination of AZA, VPA, and ATRA in patients with
AML or high-risk MDS. AZA was administered at a
fixed dose of 75 mg/m2 daily for 7 days. VPA was doseescalated and given orally daily for 7 days concomitantly. ATRA was given at 45 mg/m2 orally daily for 5
days, starting on day 3. A total of 53 patients were treated. The MTD dose of VPA in this combination was 50
mg/kg daily for 7 days. DLT was reversible neurotoxicity. The ORR was 42%. Median remission duration was
26 weeks. In conclusion, the combination studied is safe
and has significant clinical activity [136].
The activity of VPA was also evaluated on solid
tumors. Twelve patients with cervical cancer were

enrolled for phase I trial in 2005. The patients were
treated with VPA after a baseline tumor biopsy and
blood sampling at the following dose levels (four
patients each): 20 mg/kg; 30 mg/kg, or 40 mg/kg for 5
days via oral route. At day 6, tumor and blood sampling
were repeated and the study protocol ended. Blood
levels of VPA were measured at day 6 once the steadystate was reached. Mean daily dose for all patients was
1890 mg. Depressed level of consciousness of grade 2
was registered in nine patients. Serum levels of VPA
ranged from 73.6-170.49 ug/mL. Tumor deacetylase
activity decreased in eight patients with a statistically
significant difference between pre and post-treatment
values of HDAC activity (p < 0.0264). No correlation
between tumor hyperacetylation with serum levels of
valproic acid was found [137]. Another phase I study in
Twenty-six pre-treated patients with progressing solid
tumors also showed that neurocognitive impairment
dominated the toxicity profile, with grade 3 or 4 neurological side effects occurring in 8 out of 26 patients. No
grade 3 or 4 hematological toxicity was observed. The
MTD of infusion VPA was 60 mg kg/day. Further investigations are warranted to evaluate the effect of VPA
alone and in combination with other cytotoxic drugs
[138].
In another phase I study, a sequence-specific combination of VPA and epirubicin in solid tumor malignancies
was done. Patients were treated with increasing doses of
VPA for three days followed by epirubicin in 3-week
cycles. The study evaluated PK and PD end points, toxicities, and tumor response. DLTs were similar to that
seen with single agent VPA. No exacerbation of epirubicin-related toxicities was observed. The MTD and
recommended phase II dose was VPA 140 mg/kg/d for
48 hours followed by epirubicin 100 mg/m2. PRs were
seen across different tumor types in nine patients (22%),
and SDs were seen in 16 patients (39%). Anti-tumor

[136]

activity was observed in heavily pretreated patients and
historically anthracycline-resistant tumors [139]. In
another phase I study in patient with metastatic
NSCLC, combination of decitabine at dose 5 mg/m2 for
10 days with VPA at 10 mg/kg/d on days 5-21 of a 28
day cycle was not well tolerated. Further study of decitabine at a five day schedule in combination with HDAC
inhibitors is ongoing [139,140].
A phase II study of hydralazine and VPA in treating
patients with advanced solid tumors revealed clinical
benefit. Primary tumor included cervix (3), breast (3),
lung (1), testis (1), and ovarian (7) carcinomas. Clinical
benefit was observed in 12 (80%) patients: four PRs, and
eight SDs. The most significant toxicity was hematological [141].

Conclusions
Targeted therapy is widely used nowadays for cancer
treatment. The targeting agents include inhibitors of tyrosine kinases, angiogenesis, mTOR, and epigenetic pathways, to name a few [142-145]. Besides vorinostat, there
are more than 8 other HDAC inhibitors undergoing
active clinical investigation. It is noteworthy that
ITF2357 showed significant anti-HL activity. Panobinostat showed consistent anti-leukemic effects. Belinostat
appears to be promising for treating LMP ovarian
tumor. The combination of AZA, VPA, and ATRA has
significant clinical activity in leukemia and MDS. Epigenetic agents in combination regimens for cancer therapy
are being actively studied.
