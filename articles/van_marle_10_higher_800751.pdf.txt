colon compared to blood and other
gastrointestinal compartments in HIV infection

Abstract
Background: The gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) is the largest lymphoid organ infected by human
immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). It serves as a viral reservoir and host-pathogen interface in infection. This
study examined whether different parts of the gut and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) contain different drugresistant HIV-1 variants.
Methods: Gut biopsies (esophagus, stomach, duodenum and colon) and PBL were obtained from 8 HIV-1 infected
preHAART (highly active antiretroviral therapy) patients at three visits over 18 months. Patients received AZT, ddI or
combinations of AZT/ddI. HIV-1 Reverse transcriptase (RT)-coding sequences were amplified from viral DNA
obtained from gut tissues and PBL, using nested PCR. The PCR fragments were cloned and sequenced. The
resulting sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analyses, and antiretroviral drug mutations were identified.
Results: Phylogenetic and drug mutation analyses revealed differential distribution of drug resistant mutations in
the gut within patients. The level of drug-resistance conferred by the RT sequences was significantly different
between different gut tissues and PBL, and varied with antiretroviral therapy. The sequences conferring the highest
level of drug-resistance to AZT were found in the colon.
Conclusion: This study confirms that different drug-resistant HIV-1 variants are present in different gut tissues, and
it is the first report to document that particular gut tissues may select for drug resistant HIV-1 variants.

Introduction
Science has been confronted with the problem of drugresistance virtually since the introduction of the first
antiretroviral drugs to treat infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (reviewed in [1]).
The first approach to antiretroviral therapy (ART)
used single nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors
(NRTIs) which were found to select for drug-resistant
variants very quickly [1,2]. The development of many
new NRTI, non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTI),
and protease inhibitors (PI) offered additional treatment options in cases of drug-resistance. It also
offered the possibility of combination therapies (i.e.
highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)) able to

suppress HIV replication and reduce the likelihood of
developing drug-resistance [1-3].
The ability of HIV-1 to rapidly develop drug-resistance
is linked to its highly divergent nature as a result of the
error-prone reverse transcription step in its life cycle [4].
Due to the high mutation rate, HIV-1 exists in the infected
individual as a collection of many different viral variants,
also known as a quasi-species [5]. The extent of quasispecies diversity during infection is amongst others
affected by factors such as viral fitness, availability of cells
for infection, selective pressure from antiretroviral therapy,
duration of infection, and host immune responses [5-8].
Studies of patients on antiretroviral therapy revealed
that viral sequences continued to evolve in genes not
targeted by the drugs, despite successful suppressive
therapy [9-11]. This phenomenon can be explained by
continued viral replication in other tissues and/or cell
compartments due to inefficient action or penetration of
the antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) in these compartments.

These inefficiently targeted compartments are referred
to as sanctuary sites (reviewed in [12-14]). The central
nervous system (CNS) is well known as a sanctuary site,
because certain antiretroviral drugs do not easily cross
the blood-brain barrier [13]. Recent studies postulated
the gut may also be an important sanctuary site, where
HIV-1 can persist despite successful antiviral therapy
[15,16]. This is consistent with observations in the SIV
model [17]. The gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT)
is known as a major site for viral replication, CD4 +
T-cell depletion, and immune dysfunction [18-22]. However, relatively little is known about the distribution of
HIV-1 antiretroviral drug-resistance across different
parts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. We recently
showed that HIV-1 quasi-species varied within different
parts of the GI tract of pre-HAART patients, indicating
that HIV-1 replication in the gut is compartmentalized
[23]. Now, we have extended these observations to show
that variability exists in the distribution of drug-resistant
variants in different gut tissues and peripheral blood
lymphocytes of these pre-HAART patients. The number
of drug-resistant HIV variants differed in the colon
compared to blood and other gut tissues, depending on
the antiretroviral therapy received. This suggests that
antiretroviral drug-resistance is highly variable in the
different gut compartments.

from only two gut-tissues and PBL could be obtained, in
particular for visit 1 (Additional File 1). In total, around
1000 RT-coding sequences were obtained and analyzed.
The mean total (d), and nonsynonymous (dN ) pairwise distances between patients were calculated for the
RT-coding sequences obtained from PBL, esophagus,
stomach, duodenum, and colon for all patients at all
visits (Figure 1). Although we were not able to obtain
sequences from the duodenum and colon for visit 1 for
a number of patients, the overall interpatient distances
(d) of RT coding sequences tended to decrease
(p < 0.05) at the last visit for sequences derived from
the PBL, esophagus, stomach, and the duodenum
(Figure 1). This suggested evolution towards a more
conserved RT coding region between patients in these
tissues in this particular sample of patients. In contrast,
the overall interpatient distance of the RT-coding
sequences in the colon increased over time (p < 0.05)
(Figure 1). A decrease in the d N values (i.e. codon/
amino acid changing substitutions) (p < 0.05) towards
the last visit between the patients was observed for the
RT-coding region for both PBL and duodenum, while in
the esophagus and stomach the dN decreased but fluctuated over time. In the colon the d N values increased
(Figure 1), suggesting greater interpatient diversity in
RT coding sequences in the colon in this group of
patients.

Compartmentalization of antiretroviral drug-resistance in

The samples were obtained from a preHAART cohort
study of HIV-1 seropositive men who have sex with
men (MSM) [24,25]. The 8 patients in the current
report were used in an earlier study of HIV-1 diversity
in the gut [23]. For the current study, gut and peripheral
blood lymphocyte (PBL) samples from these 8 patients
from 3 subsequent visits over 18 months were used
(Table 1). All patients were on mono- or dual therapies
of primarily AZT (azidothymidine, zidovudine) and ddI
(dideoxyinosine). One patient (#42) died during the
study and only samples from the first visit were available. This patient was still included in our analyses as a
patient with end stage disease and suspected drug resistance. In addition, five patients (#1, #3, #7, #8, #19)
were still alive at the time of this study (2007) and
received HAART. For patients #3, #7, #8, #19, year 2007
PBL samples (indicated as Visit 2007) were collected,
and drug-resistance mutations were assessed to get
insight in the drug resistance mutations 15 years after
the original visit. HIV-1 viral sequences were most consistently amplified from DNA from most PBL and
biopsy tissues, using our nested PCR protocol. Therefore, our analyses focused on these viral DNA derived
sequences. For some patient visits RT-coding sequences

The RT sequences were subsequently subjected to phylogenetic analyses. Neighbour-joining trees of all RT
sequences and bootstrap analysis revealed clustering of
some sequences by tissue and patient (bootstrap values
> 70). As we previously reported such clustering was
not consistent for most of the sequences [23] (data not
shown). Bootstrap analyses of RT sequences by individual patient and visit, revealed more consistent clustering on the basis of tissue (bootstrap values > 70),
although this also varied by patient (Figure 2). The
representative neighbour-joining trees for the RT
sequences for patient #3 (Visit 2), #42 (Visit 1), and #1
(Visit 2) revealed clustering of sequences (bootstrap
values > 70) on the basis of tissue (Figure 2). Similar
trees were obtained for the other patients and visits
(data not shown). Further analysis of the clustering pattern using the Slatkin-Maddison test [26-28] revealed
that there was no consistent significant compartmentalization of the RT sequences. However, many sequences
grouped together by tissue in the phylogenetic trees (for
example patient #7, Visit 2, Figure 2).
We analyzed the presence of mutations associated
with NRTI resistance using the Stanford HIV-1 DrugResistance Database [29]. As shown in Figure 2, distinct

drug-resistance mutations were found in each tissue
compartment for patient #3 (Visit 2), consistent with
grouping together of the nucleic acid sequences. For
patient #1 (visit 2), we observed grouping of sequences
by tissue, but very few drug-resistance mutations, probably due to the greater efficiency of therapy with two
NRTIs (AZT and ddI). For patient #42 (Visit 1), various
drug resistance mutations were found in the stomach,
colon, and PBL, which was consistent with the suspected viral failure due to antiviral drug resistance. Different or no mutations were present in the duodenum,

stomach and esophagus of this patient suggesting that
antiretroviral drug resistance can differ significantly
among tissues. Although the clustering of RT sequences
of Patient #7 (Visit 2) was not indicative of compartmentalization according to the Slatkin-Maddison criteria, the different tissue compartments could still be
separated and grouped based on drug-resistance mutations. This observation was consistent for all patients
and visits, as illustrated for patient #60 in Figure 3.

Figure 1 Viral interpatient diversity of the RT-coding region in the gut tissues (esophagus (E), stomach (S), duodenum (D), colon (C))
and PBL (L) of HIV-1 infected patients at different visits. Viral RT-coding sequences tended to a more conserved sequence among patients
in the esophagus, stomach, duodenum and PBL, as reflected by the lower mean total distance (d) between patients, while the sequences in the
colon became more diverse over time. Similarly, the decrease in mean total non-synonomous distance (dN, i.e. amino acid changing mutations)
for PBL and duodenum suggested evolution towards more conserved RT protein sequences over time among patients, while the increased dN
reflected the RT protein sequence becoming more diverse over time in the colon among patients. These observations indicated that the RTcoding region evolved differently in the different gut tissues and PBL in this group of patients. (*p < 0.05, Dunnett C post-hoc analysis)

Figure 2 Representative bootstrap Neighbor-Joining trees of RT-coding sequences obtained from gut tissues (esophagus (E), stomach
(S), duodenum (D), colon (C)) and PBL (L) (indicated by different shapes and shading). RT sequences grouped by individual gut tissue and
PBL to varying degrees in the different patients. Upon closer examination of the drug-resistance mutations indicated at each branch, grouping
of resistance mutations by gut tissue and PBL was observed. Differences in drug-resistance mutations were found in the different tissues and
PBL. Similar differences were observed for RT sequences recovered from the tissues of other patients, indicating difference in distribution of
drug-resistance in the gut. (Bootstrap values > 70 are indicated.)

resulted in the same tree topologies (data not shown),
indicating that the drug resistance conferring sites were
not solely responsible for the observed clustering of RT
sequences by tissue.
These observations strongly suggest a differential distribution of antiretroviral drug-resistance in the different
gut tissues, with drug-resistance mutations differing
from those observed in the blood. These observations
were further corroborated by sorting drug-mutations by
tissue compartment (summarized in Table 2 and Additional File 1), indicating drug-resistance mutations differed significantly between tissues within each patient
(p < 0.05 Chi-square test), and varied over time (p <
0.05, Chi-square test). Furthermore, the different tissues
also differed significantly in distribution of drug-resistance mutations in the viral quasi-species (p < 0.05 Chisquare test). Our analysis revealed no evidence for a

preferential presence of any specific drug-resistance
mutations for any individual tissue compartment.
Table 2 also shows the drug-resistance mutation profile
of the PBL samples for two surviving patients currently
on HAART, collected in 2007, 15 years after the original
study. Again, drug-resistance mutations differed from the
original historical samples (p < 0.05 Chi-square test), and
similar results were obtained for the other two surviving
patients (Additional File 1). This analysis confirms that
the changes observed in the viral DNA samples were the
result of changes in the viral population close to the time
of sampling and not the result of picking up viral DNA
sequences that were archived over many years.
Different drug-resistance levels in different parts of the gut

The development of drug-resistance is dependent on the
drugs used in therapy. We analyzed the percentage of

mutations (indicated at the tree branches) and grouping of RT-coding sequences was observed. However, at all visits differences were observed
in the drug-resistance mutations between the various tissues, consistent with differential distribution of drug-resistance in the gut. Similar results
were obtained for the RT-coding sequence of the other patients. (Bootstrap values > 70 are indicated.)

drug-resistant sequences and the average drug-resistance
score for all sequences recovered from each tissue, taking into account the antiretroviral therapy received prior
to the time samples were collected (Figure 4). The Stanford database was used to determine the drug-resistance
score for each RT sequence. RT sequences with a drugresistance score ≥ 30 were designated drug-resistant.
Following AZT or ddI treatment, different numbers of
respectively AZT- or ddI-resistant RT-coding sequences
were found in the GI tissues (esophagus, stomach, duodenum and colon) and PBL (i.e. blood) (p < 0.05, Figure
4A and 4B). Thus, the distribution of drug-resistant
sequences is diverse, and antiretroviral therapy selects
for different numbers of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants
in each tissue.
Next, we analyzed the average drug-resistance score of
all drug-resistant RT sequences (i.e drug-resistance
score ≥ 30) among the different tissues following AZT
or ddI treatment (Figure 4C and 4D). This analysis

revealed that RT sequences with the highest drug-resistance score for AZT were recovered from the colon
(Figure 4C, p < 0.05). No significant differences in ddI
resistance scores were observed following ddI treatment,
although they tended to be higher in the stomach (Figure 4D). Together with our other observations, these
results suggested that antiretroviral therapies (AZT and
ddI) affected each gut tissue compartment differently,
and that AZT preferentially selected for more AZT
resistant HIV-1 variants in the colon.

Discussion
The presence of HIV-1 antiretroviral drug-resistance in
different tissues, such as the CNS, has been well document [30-33]. However, little is known about HIV-1
antiretroviral drug-resistance in different tissues of
the gut, despite its importance as a reservoir for viral
replication and a host pathogen interphase in HIV/
AIDS [18-22]. To provide insight into the potential

distribution of HIV-1 drug-resistance at different locations in the gut (esophagus, stomach, duodenum and
colorectum) and in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL),
we analyzed the RT sequences from 8 HIV-1 infected
patients. Our previous study on compartmentalization
of HIV-1 replication revealed a greater compartmentalization of the viral quasi-species for the Nef region compared to the RT-coding region [23]. Similarly, the
current study indicated that compartmentalization is
less prominent for the RT coding region. The bootstrap
analyses clearly indicated clustering of RT sequences by
tissues in a number of patients but not all. Moreover,
the clustering could not be considered a sign of significant compartmentalization of RT sequences in the GI
tract according to the criteria of the Slatkin-Maddison
test. However, the current study clearly showed that patterns of HIV-1 drug-resistance significantly vary across

different gut compartments, distinct from what is found
in blood (i.e. PBL). This is indicative of a differential distribution of HIV-1 antiretroviral drug-resistance in the
GI-tract.
Varying viral diversity was observed for the RT-coding
region in gut and PBL over time. Despite the fact that we
were unable to obtain sequences for all lower GI tissues
for a number of patients at visit 1, we observed a tendency
towards a more conserved RT-coding region in the PBL,
esophagus, stomach and duodenum between patients at
the later visits. This may be a sign of adaptation of the
virus to the different tissues, as there are some indications
the RT-protein might affect cell tropism [34,35]. In addition, the host immune response could shape viral evolution and select for particular viral sequences in different
tissues [36-40]. In contrast, viral diversity for the RTcoding region between patients increased over time in the

Figure 4 Analysis of the effects of AZT and ddI treatment on drug-resistance in esophagus (E), stomach (S), duodenum (D), colon (C)
and PBL (L). Resistance mutations were recorded and scored using the Stanford Drug-Resistance Database for level of drug-resistance.
Sequences with intermediate to high-level resistance for AZT, or ddI were considered drug-resistant. The number of drug-resistance sequences
recovered after AZT (A) or ddI (B) treatment in each tissue was expressed as the percentage of all sequences recovered from the tissue.
Different numbers of AZT and ddI resistant sequences were found in the gut tissues and PBL following AZT treatment and ddI treatment,
respectively (* p < 0.05, Pearson chi-square test). The average drug-resistance score for each drug also varied in each tissue. AZT drug resistance
scores were the highest in the colon following AZT treatment (C). However, ddI resistance scores did not differ significantly in the different
tissues following ddI treatment (D). These observations are consistent with differential distribution of antiretroviral drug-resistance in the gut, and
indicated that the AZT and ddI treatment affected each tissue differently (* p < 0.05, Tukeys HSD post-hoc analysis).

colon. Although, we did not study variation over time and
only assessed one isolated visit in our previous study on
the compartmentalization of the gut viral reservoir [23],
the data of that study also suggested an increased diversity
in both the Nef- and RT-coding regions in the colon. We
explained this increased viral diversity by the higher levels
of HIV-1 replication that we and others have observed in
the colon [9-11,23]. Probably in part due to the activated
state of the GI tract in HIV-1 infection, lymphoid cells
obtained from the GI-tract are very susceptible to HIV
infection compared to blood or other tissue lymphocytes
allowing for an increased viral replication [41-43]. The
increased error prone replication would result in higher
viral diversity. Although these findings corroborate our
previous observations, we did observe that viral diversity
between patients fluctuated to various degrees over
time among the different tissues, indicating HIV-1 quasispeciesevolution in the different compartments is dynamic.
For our current study, we were only able to consistently amplify HIV RT sequences from the integrated
and nonintegrated viral DNA found in total tissue DNA.

Therefore, our study was restricted to an analysis of
HIV drug resistance of the banked viral reservoir and
potentially not actively replicating viruses. Despite this
limitation our data clearly indicated that antiviral drug
resistant mutations are easily detected in the gut viral
DNA reservoir. Furthermore, our data revealed that the
viral gut reservoir is variable and dynamic. Significant
changes together with selection for antiviral drug resistance occurred within a matter of weeks or months
under continuous antiviral therapy. These banked viral
reservoirs are clinically significant as they could be an
important source of drug resistant viruses.
As in our previous study [23], analyses of all RTcoding sequences did not reveal the same pattern of
clustering by tissue that we observed for the Nef encoding region. The bootstrap analysis of sequences by individual patient and visit revealed varying degrees of
clustering of sequences by tissue among the different
patients, but this clustering did not pass the SlatkinMaddison test for compartmentalization. The latter
would suggest that the different gut tissues are not

van Marle et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:74
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/74

strictly isolated reservoirs and viruses are exchanged
between the different compartments, similar to what has
been reported for HIV-1 in blood and lung compartments in Mycobacterium tuberculosis co-infected individuals [44]. However, NRTI drug-resistance mutations
grouped by tissue compartment, which is consistent
with compartmentalization of HIV replication in the gut
[23]. Moreover, drug-resistance mutations varied among
various tissues, and differed from those in the blood (i.e.
PBL). The levels of drug-resistance also varied across
the different tissues, as indicated by the number of
drug-resistant RT sequences recovered from the gut tissues and PBL, and the average resistance scores for
AZT and ddI. The drugs could target the tissues with
different efficiency, thereby selecting differentially for
drug-resistant viruses in each tissue. Alternatively, the
immune activated state of the GI tract during HIV-1
infection could also alter drug metabolism and turnover
in the different gut tissues. Other studies have observed
differential distribution of HIV sequences and antiviral
drug resistance amongst different immune cells in the
blood depending on the patient [45,46]. It is therefore
possible that the differential distribution of different
populations of immune cells in the gut is underlying the
differential distribution of drug resistance in our study.
For the immune cells in the blood compartment, Potter
et al. [45] postulated that differences in drug penetration
in the different cells and different cell turn-over due to,
for instance, differences in viremea or inflammatory
response could alter cell distribution. This could also
play a role in each gut tissue, and alter viral populations
and drug resistance in a patient and tissue dependent
fashion.
Based on our observations, one may conclude that
AZT resistant viruses may arise first in the colon, and
then start seeding the PBL and other gut tissues. The
current data does not allow us to determine this unequivocally and further studies will be necessary. Our
data did suggest that the colon selected for highly drugresistant viruses. This could be due to the different antiretroviral drug-concentrations in the different tissues.
Studies in rats have shown that after oral administration
the intestinal absorption of zidovudine is lower in the
colon compared to other parts of the intestinal tract (i.e.
duodenum and jejunum) [47]. To our knowledge it is
unknown how this effects drug concentrations in the
colon, although in prenatal foetal rats higher zidovudine
concentrations have been reported in the colon compared to plasma [48]. The higher number of target
immune cells in the colon compared to the esophagus,
stomach and duodenum [49-52], together with these
altered drug concentrations could facilitate the evolution
of highly drug-resistant viruses. Similarly, as part of the
adaptation processes of HIV-1 to these tissues, certain

Page 9 of 13

mutations in the RT protein may be required that also
happen to affect antiretroviral drug-resistance. The
increased level of AZT resistance in the colon is of
interest as various studies have shown that viral RNA/
loads can remain higher in the colon under antiretroviral viral therapy, even when the plasma viral loads are
effectively reduced [9,10,53-56]. Again further studies
will be necessary, but our observations would explain
why this is the case.
Our analysis focused on the primary drug resistance
mutations in the main body of the RT encoding region.
The sequencing method used did not analyze either the
connection or RNase H domains of RT, both of which
are known to contain sites that can affect levels of resistance to AZT [57-59]. It would be of interest to examine
how this important part of the RT region evolves in the
different gut tissues, as our current analyses may actually underestimate AZT resistance in the GI tract.
Finally, the patient samples for this study were collected during the preHAART era (1993-1996). Our analysis of antiretroviral drug-resistance in different parts of
the gut in this period of the HIV epidemic is extremely
relevant in the current era of HAART. Suboptimal treatment conditions still exist, in part due to patient noncompliance and toxicity of antiretroviral drugs. The data
gathered from our studies about preHAART HIV-1
infection of the gut is also of importance for the HIV-1
epidemic in the developing world, where comprehensive
HAART regimens may not be consistently available, and
the proposed antiviral strategies may not be fully suppressive. Moreover, our observations are also relevant
for other HIV-1 subtypes as they also have been shown
to replicate differentially in the GALT (reviewed in
[60]). The importance of viral reservoirs or archives in
antiretroviral therapy is illustrated by recent observations in the context of antiretroviral therapy to reduce
mother-to-child transmission. A single dose treatment
with the NNRTI inhibitor nevirapine was already
enough to establish nevirapine resistance in the latent
cell reservoirs in the blood of the HIV infected mother
[61]. This could complicate subsequent ART or HAART
treatments due to preexisting drug resistance. A better
understanding of the evolution of antiretroviral drugresistance in the different gut tissues and other cell
compartments will help optimize antiretroviral therapies
in both developed and developing countries.

Conclusions
It has been proposed that HIV-1 can “hide” from antiretroviral therapy in the gut, and drug-resistance may be
compartmentalized [15,16,62]. Our results showed that
antiretroviral resistance differed among the different gut
tissues and is highly variable. More importantly
it showed that drug-resistance in the gut can be

van Marle et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:74
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/74

completely different from what is observed in the periphery (i.e. blood). The differential distribution of antiretroviral drug-resistance in the gut and the differential
selection for drug-resistant viruses in the gut; support
the hypothesis that the gut could act as “hide-out” from
antiretroviral therapy [15,16].

Methods
Patients and gut biopsy samples

Samples for this study had been collected from patients
enrolled in a previous cohort study of HIV-1 seropositive men who have sex with men (MSM) followed at the
Southern Alberta Clinic (SAC), Calgary, Alberta from
1993-1996 [24,25]. All protocols were reviewed and
approved by the Office of Medical Bioethics of the University of Calgary and patients signed informed consent
documentation upon enrolment [25]. Patients were prospectively followed and laboratory analyses included
plasma viral load and CD4+ cell counts at each study
visit. At approximate 6 month intervals, upper and
lower gastrointestinal endoscopies were performed and
biopsies were collected from the esophagus, stomach,
duodenum, and colon and stored at -70°C [24]. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were isolated from blood
and stored in liquid nitrogen [24,25]. This cohort was
recruited prior to the introduction of HAART at the
SAC in 1997. The 8 patients described in this study
were used earlier in a study on HIV-1 diversity in the
gut (Table 1.) [23]. Gut tissue and PBL samples from
three consecutive visits were analyzed, covering a time
period of 18 months. Disease progressed in all patients
(mean age 36 yrs, range 30-44 yrs), with an average
CD4+ cell count of 125 ± 122 cells/μl, and plasma viral
load of 4.0 ± 0.8 log10 copies/ml at the last visit (Table
1). During the time interval studied, the patients
received monotherapy or dual therapy with the NRTIs:
azidothymidine (AZT, zidovudine), dideoxyinosine (ddI)
prior to and during the study period (Table 1). One
patient (#42) also received dideoxycitidine (ddC) in
combination with AZT during the period preceding the
study and died after the first visit (Table 1). Five patients
were still alive at the time of this study (2007) and
received HAART. PBLs from four of these patients (#3,
#7, #8, #19) were collected, and drug-resistance mutations (15 years after the original study) were assessed,
and are indicated as Visit 2007.
DNA Isolation and PCR Amplification of Viral Sequences
from Gut Biopsies

Total DNA was isolated from tissue using Trizol Reagent
(Invitrogen, Burlington, ON), and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT)-coding sequences (at nt. 2604-3251) were amplified from viral DNA by nested PCR as described previously
[23]. The amplification of integrated and nonintegrated

Page 10 of 13

viral DNA ensured that expressed, dormant and/or ‘banked’
varieties were included in our analysis [63-66]. Briefly, the
nested PCR protocol consisted of denaturation at 94°C for
5 min, 45 cycles of 1 min at 95°C, 1 min at the annealing
temperature of the primer set used, 2 min at 70°C, and a
final extension step of 10 min at 70°C. The primers used
for the first round were RT 2470 5′-GTA CAG TAT TAG
GAC CTA CAC CTG-3′ and RT 3261 5′-ATC AGG ATG
GAG TTC ATA ACC CAT CCA-3′ (Tm = 55°C), and for
the second round consisted of RT 2604 5′-CCA AAA GTT
AAA CAA TGG CCA TTG ACA-3′ and RT 3251 5′-AGT
TCA TAA CCC ATC CAA AG-3′ (Tm = 55°C). Both primary and nested PCR reactions were performed with a
high fidelity Taq polymerase to reduce the incorporation of
mutations during amplification. To avoid selective amplification of the most dominant viral sequences at the expense
of less frequent viral sequences due to high template concentrations or amplification of single viral DNA copies due
to low template concentrations, optimal template concentrations were determined by dilution experiments. We used
2 to 10 fold dilutions of template DNA (initial input 0.2
μg), and the dilutions that yielded the most abundant PCR
products were used for analyses. To prevent contamination
with amplicons, DNA isolation, PCR amplifications and
subsequent cloning steps, were performed in separated
rooms and laboratory areas. Negative (no viral DNA) and
positive (plasmid containing proviral DNA of HIV-1 strain
NL4-3) controls were included during all amplifications.
The PCR fragments were separated and isolated from agarose gels, and directly sequenced to ensure genuine HIV-1
viral DNA had been amplified.
Sequence Analysis

To analyze the HIV-1 quasi-species within each tissue
sample, the nested PCR products identified as amplicons
of genuine HIV-1 DNA were cloned into pCR2.1 TOPO
linearized vector using the TA cloning kit (Invitrogen,
Burlington, ON). Plasmids containing relevant inserts
were purified from bacteria using a Plasmid Mini-Prep Kit
(Qiagen, Mississauga, ON). The inserts were sequenced
on an automated ABI sequencer (Applied Biosystems,
Streetsville, ON) and a Li-Cor 4300 DNA Analysis sequencing system (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) according to
manufacturers′ protocols. For each compartment, 5-10
clones containing HIV-1 RT fragments were sequenced.
For a number of samples we repeated both PCR and subsequent sequence analysis, and similar results were
obtained, indicating our approach was reproducible.
Sequences have been submitted to Genbank (EF656787 to
EF656965, and EU931894 to EU932684).
Phylogenetic Analysis

The inferred amino acid sequence for the cloned DNA
fragments was obtained for each sample, and screened

van Marle et al. Retrovirology 2010, 7:74
http://www.retrovirology.com/content/7/1/74

for the integrity of coding sequences, i.e. stop codons,
deletions, and/or insertions. DNA sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis using the Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) version 4.0
software (http://www.megasoftware.net) [67]. Neighbour-joining trees were constructed using the Kimura-2parameter model with 5000 replicates for the bootstrap
analysis. Bootstrap values >70 were considered significant. Compartmentalization of sequences was assessed
using the Slatkin-Maddison test using the Mesquite
Software Package (http://mesquiteproject.org) [26-28].
Sequences of prototypic HIV-1 isolates (NL4-3, YU-2,
NDK) were included to rule out contamination with
laboratory strains and to root the bootstrap trees.
The MEGA software was used to calculate mean total
interpatient (d), non-synonymous (dN, codon changing
substitutions), and synonymous (dS, non-codon changing substitutions) distances [5] for the nucleic acid
sequences for each patient in regard to tissue compartments, as well as differences between patients at each
visit. All distances and phylogenetic analyses were calculated after pair-wise deletion and stripping of gaps in
the aligned sequences. Analysis of variance (ANOVA)
and Dunnett C post-hoc tests were performed to compare the distances.
Antiretroviral Drug-Resistance Analysis

All RT sequences were screened for drug-resistance
mutations (NRTI as well as NNRTI) using the Stanford
HIV-1 Drug-Resistance Database algorithm (http://hivdb.
stanford.edu/) [29]. Mutations not identified to be associated with resistance were also recorded. The Stanford
database assigns a numerical score to each sequence with
regard to individual antiretroviral drugs, i.e. susceptible
(0-9), potential-low level (10-14), low-level (15-29), intermediate (30-59), or high-level (≥60) resistance. Drugresistance scores assigned by the database for AZT, and
ddI, (as the most commonly used antiretroviral drugs in
this study) were tabulated and grouped for all patients
and visits. Visits of patients, in which patients did not
receive therapy, or other drugs then AZT or ddI, were
excluded from the analysis. For the purpose of this study,
we arbitrarily assigned clones to one of two nominal categories (resistant or not resistant) based on the drug-resistance score assigned by the database. Clones scoring
intermediate or high-level (≥30) were assigned to the
resistant category and isolates scoring susceptible, potential-low level, or low-level (<30) were assigned to the not
resistant category. The Pearson chi-square test was used
to test for differences in the number and distribution of
drug-resistant mutations and sequences between tissues.
ANOVA with Tukey’s HSD post-hoc analysis was used
to compare mean drug-resistance scores between tissue
compartments.
