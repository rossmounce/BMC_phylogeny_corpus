Abstract
Background: The phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS) plays a major role in
sugar transport and in the regulation of essential physiological processes in many bacteria. The PTS
couples solute transport to its phosphorylation at the expense of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and
it consists of general cytoplasmic phosphoryl transfer proteins and specific enzyme II complexes
which catalyze the uptake and phosphorylation of solutes. Previous studies have suggested that the
evolution of the constituents of the enzyme II complexes has been driven largely by horizontal gene
transfer whereas vertical inheritance has been prevalent in the general phosphoryl transfer proteins
in some bacterial groups. The aim of this work is to test this hypothesis by studying the evolution
of the phosphoryl transfer proteins of the PTS.
Results: We have analyzed the evolutionary history of the PTS phosphoryl transfer chain (PTSptc) components in 222 complete genomes by combining phylogenetic methods and analysis of
genomic context. Phylogenetic analyses alone were not conclusive for the deepest nodes but when
complemented with analyses of genomic context and functional information, the main evolutionary
trends of this system could be depicted.
Conclusion: The PTS-ptc evolved in bacteria after the divergence of early lineages such as
Aquificales, Thermotogales and Thermus/Deinococcus. The subsequent evolutionary history of the
PTS-ptc varied in different bacterial lineages: vertical inheritance and lineage-specific gene losses
mainly explain the current situation in Actinobacteria and Firmicutes whereas horizontal gene transfer
(HGT) also played a major role in Proteobacteria. Most remarkably, we have identified a HGT event
from Firmicutes or Fusobacteria to the last common ancestor of the Enterobacteriaceae,
Pasteurellaceae, Shewanellaceae and Vibrionaceae. This transfer led to extensive changes in the
metabolic and regulatory networks of these bacteria including the development of a novel carbon
catabolite repression system. Hence, this example illustrates that HGT can drive major
physiological modifications in bacteria.

Background
The phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase system (PTS) was originally described as a sugar
phosphorylation system [1] and it represents hitherto the
only example of group-translocating transport systems
[2]. The PTS couples solute transport to its phosphorylation at the expense of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and it
also plays a central role in the regulation of a number of
cell processes in some bacteria [3-6]. This system consists
of general cytoplasmic energy-coupling proteins, enzyme
I (EI) and HPr, and specific enzyme II complexes, which
catalyze the uptake and phosphorylation of solutes [3,7].
In turn, enzyme II complexes consist of three functional
subunits, IIA, IIB and IIC, although those belonging to the
mannose family contain an additional subunit, IID. These
complexes have been divided into seven classes on the
basis of their amino acid sequence and structural properties [3,7-9].
The PTS thus constitutes a phosphoryl-transfer chain that
starts at EI (Fig. 1), which can be phosphorylated by PEP
at a histidine residue in the presence of Mg2+. Phospho-EI
transfers the phosphoryl group to HPr, which becomes
phosphorylated at a conserved histidine-15 residue [10].
P~His-HPr functions as a phosphoryl donor to the different enzyme II complexes. In Firmicutes, HPr can undergo
a second ATP-dependent phosphorylation at a serine-46
residue, catalyzed by a metabolically activated HPr kinase
(HPrK; see Fig. 1) [11,12]. This ATP-dependent phospho-

rylation plays a major role in carbon catabolite repression
(CCR) in these bacteria [13]. HPrK monomers are constituted by two structural domains: the carboxyl terminal
domain displays the kinase and phosphorylase activities
and responds to all known effectors similarly as the entire
enzyme [14] whereas the function of the N-terminal
domain is unknown [15].
The PTS has been thoroughly studied in some Enterobacteriaceae and Firmicutes. These studies have shown that PTS
proteins participate in many other physiological processes
such as chemotaxis, regulation of carbon metabolism,
coordination of carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and
others [3,6,7]. In some bacteria, especially in Proteobacteria, a number of paralogs of the general cytoplasmic,
energy-coupling EI and HPr proteins are present. Some of
these paralogs are apparently specialized in a regulatory
role. For example, in Escherichia coli paralogs of EI (EINtr),
HPr (NPr) and a fructose-class IIA protein (IIANtr) constitute a parallel PTS-ptc that apparently functions only in
regulation [16]. Furthermore, some PTS proteins interact
with other non-PTS proteins modulating their activity [3].
For example, IIAGlu mediates CCR in enterobacteria by
interacting with adenylate cyclase together with an additional non-characterized regulatory factor [17]. In Firmicutes, P-Ser-HPr acts as a co-regulator of a LacI/GalR type
protein named CcpA [18,19], enabling its binding to the
cre sites preceding catabolite-controlled transcription
units [20].

The distribution and evolutionary origin of PTS components have been analyzed in a number of studies [7,2126] which have suggested that PTS is exclusively found in
bacteria. However, a gene cluster which encodes a complete PTS is present in the archaeon Haloarcula marismortui, harbored in the plasmid pNG700 [27]. Moreover, the
distribution of PTS among different bacteria is very uneven [7] and shows significant differences between the
components of the phosphorylation cascade and PTS
transporters: some bacteria possess complete PTS-ptc
although they lack PTS transporters [7,23]. These data suggest that the genes responsible for the PTS-ptc and the
transporters have different evolutionary histories. Furthermore, previous analyses of the constituents of the PTS-ptc
indicated that the evolution of these proteins would be
best explained by vertical inheritance in some bacterial
groups [23] whereas a study of the mannose-class PTS
transporters indicated that the evolution of these transporters has been driven primarily by horizontal gene
transfer (HGT) [26]. This difference, along with the central role in the regulation of gene expression in some bacterial groups played by PTS-ptc prompted us to study in
detail the evolution of PTS elements involved in the phosphorylation cascade (EI, HPr and HPrK).

Results and discussion
Genetic organization and distribution of pts genes
A total of 222 microbial genomes were screened for genes
encoding EI (ptsI), HPr (ptsH) or HPrK (ptsK). This data set
included 19 Archaea and 153 Bacteria species (Table S1,
Additional file 1). Eukaryotic genomes were also investigated with negative results, thus confirming the absence
of homologs of PTS proteins. The combination of TBLAST
and PSI-BLAST searches allowed us to identify all genes
and possible pseudogenes encoding the main components of the PTS-ptc. EI and HPr were found either as single polypeptides or as fusion proteins (multiphosphoryl
transfer proteins, MTPs), usually together with a IIA
domain (Table S2, Additional file 1), whereas HPrK was
present as a single polypeptide with the exception of Fusobacterium nucleatum, which encodes a fusion protein constituted by two HPrK domains in tandem. In contrast to
ptsK, which is present in a single copy with the exception
of Oceanobacillus iheyensis, a varying number of paralogs of
ptsH and ptsI could be found in some species, mostly Proteobacteria (Table S2, Additional file 1). For example, E.
coli K12 harbors five EI-encoding and six HPr-encoding
paralogs, either as single polypeptides or as domains of
MTPs (Supplementary Table 2).

The distribution of PTS genes has been reviewed recently
[7] and we will only consider it briefly here. The components of PTS-ptc (encoded by ptsH and ptsI) were found in
most groups of bacteria included in the data set (Table S1,
Additional file 1). Relevant exceptions were early differen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/147

tiated bacterial groups such as Aquificales, Thermotogales
and the Thermus/Deinococcus group. The presence of a PTS
cluster in Deinococcus radiodurans is not a primitive trait
and will be dealt with below. Furthermore, the PTS is
absent from Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes. In the
remaining groups, the PTS-ptc is incomplete or absent in
a few species, mostly obligate intracellular parasites or
bacteria with highly specialized lifestyles such as the
methanotroph Methylococcus capsulatus (γ-Proteobacteria),
the sulphate-reducing Desulfotalea psychrophila (δ-Proteobacteria), and the bacterial predator Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus (δ-Proteobacteria). The absence of these genes in
these species from groups where PTS genes are common
can be explained by gene losses associated to their specialized lifestyles. This hypothesis agrees with the phylogenetic reconstructions as discussed below.
Our results also showed a strong correlation in the pattern
of presence/absence of EI and HPr: only a few species such
as Bartonella and Ureaplasma urealyticum harbored ptsH
genes while lacking ptsI (Table S2, Additional file 1). This
correlation was not observed for HPrK, whose distribution is more limited: genes encoding HPrK are absent
from Actinobacteria and most species of γ-Proteobacteria.
The inspection of genome sequences revealed that PTS
proteins are absent from Archaea with the exception of
Haloarcula marismortui, which harbors a gene cluster
encoding EI, HPr and the IIA, IIB and IIC constituents of
a fructose-class PTS transporter in the plasmid pNG700
[27]. To our knowledge, this is the only case of a PTS
transporter in Archaea.
Phylogenetic information content of the data sets
EI, HPr and HPrK constituted quite heterogeneous data
sets: the EI alignment consisted of 201 sequences and 399
conserved positions after its refinement with Gblocks.
Two hundred and four putative homologs of HPr were
found in the 222 genomes analyzed. Due to its short
length, the initial multiple alignment of HPr was
improved only by manual refinement, resulting in a 93positions alignment. The HPrK alignment had only 77
sequences and 337 positions after manual refinement.

The phylogenetic information content of the sequences
was evaluated using two different approaches. Firstly, we
carried out a likelihood mapping analysis (Fig. S1, Additional file 2). Briefly, this analysis enables to estimate the
suitability for phylogenetic reconstruction of a data set
from the proportion of unresolved quartets in a maximum likelihood analysis. As expected from the low
number of positions in its alignment, HPr was the protein
with the lowest phylogenetic content (only 59.4% fully
resolved quartets). In contrast, both EI and HPrK had
higher phylogenetic information contents, with 88.4%

and 86.8% fully resolved quartets, respectively. Secondly,
split networks were obtained using the Neighbor-net algorithm implemented in Splitstree. The resulting network
contained not only the maximum-likelihood topology
but also additional splits not reflected in the phylogenetic
tree.
The networks derived from the three proteins (data not
shown; available upon request) showed considerable conflicting signal, particularly in the HPr network. In contrast,
the HPrK network showed a clearer tree-like structure with
better defined deep relationships, which will be discussed
later along with the corresponding phylogenetic tree.
Finally, the EI network presented a mixed picture. On the
one hand, several proteins presented no clear relationships to any of the main groups. On the other hand, network analyses limited to specific groups revealed that
conflicting signals concentrated in the most internal
nodes. As a whole, the three genes presented unresolved
deep phylogenetic relationships along with a number of
well defined groupings and lastly, a few taxa with no clear
phylogenetic relationships.
Phylogenetic reconstruction
For the three alignments, the best evolutionary model
under the AIC criterion was rtREV [28], a model originally
developed from the analysis of retroviral sequences but
which has been shown to be one of the most commonly
retrieved models for bacterial sequence alignments [29].
The large phylogenetic distances encompassed in the
three alignments resulted in the absence of a significant
fraction of invariant sites, and in consequence only the
gamma distribution was used to take heterogeneities in
evolutionary rates among sites into account. Although
maximum likelihood and Bayesian topologies were generally coincident there were also some remarkable differences in support values for nodes. For instance, some
groups were clearly better resolved in the Bayesian than in
the maximum likelihood topology. This is exemplified in
the EI topology (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2, Additional file 2)
where larger groups like EINtr (bootstrap support, BS =
52%; Bayesian posterior probability, BPP = 1.00), T (BS =
38%, BPP = 1.00) and R (BS = 25%, BPP = 0.79) were statistically supported only by the Bayesian analyses.

The EI topology was characterized by the low support of
its most internal nodes. Nevertheless, three large groups
could be delineated. Although none of these groups had a
bootstrap support value larger than 50% (Fig. 2 and Fig.
S2, Additional file 2), the bayesian analysis, genomic context analyses and the function of some of the corresponding products justify their use as units for analysis in this
work (see below). The first group (group Ntr; gene ptsP,
EINtr) is monophyletic and it consisted of genes from αand γ-Proteobacteria and Geobacter sulfurreducens (δ-Proteo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/147

bacteria) encoding EI proteins with an N-terminal GAF
domain. The second group (group R) encompassed ptsI
genes (denoted EIR to distinguish them from other EI)
present in organisms that lack PTS transporters or harbor
additional EI-encoding paralogs (mostly MTPs) clustered
with genes encoding PTS transporters. The third group (T)
consisted mainly of ptsI genes from Firmicutes and γ-Proteobacteria (EIT). Finally, a number of smaller groups
which encompassed mostly ptsI genes of Actinomycetes and
genes encoding MTPs could be delineated (Fig. 2).
In agreement with its low phylogenetic information content, the HPr tree (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3, Additional file 2) had
high support values only in some external nodes. For
example, the HPr paralogs associated to fructose transport
(FPr) form a well-supported monophyletic group (BS =
91%; BPP = 0.92) of sequences from Enterobacteriaceae,
Pasteurellaceae and Vibrionaceae. Therefore, on its own,
this phylogenetic reconstruction cannot be taken as a reliable reflection of the evolutionary history of these genes
and it was not possible to analyze the concordance/congruence between the larger groups described above for the
EI topology and their HPr counterparts. However, it is
worth mentioning that there was a good agreement
between the small, well-supported groups at the tips of
the HPr tree and their corresponding EI counterparts. The
analysis of their genomic context also supported the evolution of EI and HPr as a single unit, as we will detail
below.
The phylogenetic analysis of HPrK proteins was complicated by the presence of truncated proteins in α-Proteobacteria and Coxiella burnetti. These proteins have preserved
only the C-terminal domain of HPrK and introduced
numerous gaps in the alignment. α-Proteobacteria
sequences appeared as a long branch stemming from the
base of the Mollicutes cluster (Fig. 4). β-Proteobacteria
(including the HPrK sequence of C. burnetti, a γ-Proteobacteria) also constituted a distinct group, although their
position did not reveal a clear relationship with α-Proteobacteria (Fig. 4). On the other hand, sequences from Firmicutes were arranged in three distinct monophyletic clusters
corresponding to Bacilli, Clostridia and Mollicutes (Fig. 4),
with the exception of a second ptsK homolog encoded by
Oceanobacillus iheyensis (oiehyk2, Fig. 4). The last group
was constituted by a paraphyletic cluster which included
Spirochetes, Candidatus Protochlamydia amoebophila, Chlorobium tepidum and G. sulfurreducens, a δ-Proteobacteria.
Genomic context and functional information
The phylogenetic analyses of the different constituents of
the PTS-ptc were not sufficient, on their own, to explain
the evolutionary history of this system. Therefore, we considered the genomic context and the functional information available in order to better interpret the previous

phylogenetic results. The functional information available, the distribution of PTS transporters in different species and the genome context showed a noteworthy
correspondence with the groups observed in the phylogenetic reconstruction of EI. Therefore, we will start by discussing the phylogenetic relationships derived from EI
proteins in relation to the information available on their
functional role and the genomic context of the corresponding genes while HPr and HPrK will be discussed
subsequently in relation to these results.
The evolutionary history of the regulatory PTS-ptc: EINtr
and EIR are functional analogs
Group R genes were found in Proteobacteria and the related
taxa Chlamydiales, Chlorobia, Planctomycetes and the spirochaete Leptospira interrogans (Fig. 2). With the exception of
some Proteobacteria, none of these organisms harbors PTS
transporters [7]. Although group R was not well supported
in the phylogenetic analysis (EIR; Fig. 2, BS = 25%, BPP =
0.79), the similarity in their corresponding gene clusters
(Fig. 5 and Fig. S4, Additional file 2) and the topological
congruence between the EI phylogeny for group R and the
16S rRNA tree (p = 0.522 in the Shimodaira-Hasegawa
test; Fig. S5A and S6, Additional file 2) suggest that the
gene encoding EIR was present in the last common ancestor of Proteobacteria and, possibly, in that of Chlamydiales,
Chlorobia, Planctomycetes and Proteobacteria.

Genes belonging to the Ntr group (ptsP genes) are found
exclusively in Proteobacteria and they encode EINtr [30].
The phylogenetic analysis showed good support (BS =

52%, BPP = 1.00) and congruence between the branching
order of EINtr encoding genes and the expected organismal
descent according to the 16S rRNA phylogenetic tree (p =
0.363 in the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test; Fig. S5B and S6,
Additional file 2). These results suggest that this gene
evolved at an early stage in the evolutionary history of Proteobacteria, possibly predating the differentiation of δ-Proteobacteria (the most basal group in this clade).
In Enterobacteriaceae, and possibly in other Proteobacteria
as well, EINtr constitutes a phosphorylation chain together
with the product of ptsO (encoding an HPr paralog
referred to as NPr) and the product of ptsN (IIANtr). Interestingly, the phylogenetic analysis of HPr-encoding genes
showed that NPr sequences of α- and γ-Proteobacteria cluster together with HPr sequences of β-Proteobacteria, δ-Proteobacteria and Xanthomonadales (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3,
Additional file 2).
The inspection of the corresponding gene clusters also
points to a close relationship between NPr- and HPrencoding genes associated to EIR. In Xanthomonadales,
ptsH and ptsI (encoding EIR) constitute an operon together
with a gene encoding a IIAMan protein and next to the cluster of rpoN genes, which includes a ptsN homolog and
ptsK. Similar gene clusters encompassing ptsN, ptsO and
rpoN are also present in the other proteobacterial groups
(Fig. 5 and Fig. S4, Additional file 2).
From the results of phylogenetic reconstruction and cluster composition analyses we hypothesize that a cluster

encompassing rpoN, ptsK, ptsI, ptsO and ptsN genes, among
others, was assembled at an early stage in the evolution of
Proteobacteria (Fig. 5 and Fig. S4, Additional file 2). Subsequent gene rearrangements led to the clusters observed in
extant species (Fig. 5 and Fig. S4, Additional file 2). These
rearrangements included the loss of ptsI (EIR) in most αand γ-Proteobacteria and the loss of ptsK and the gene
encoding IIAMan in γ-Proteobacteria, with the exception of
Xanthomonadales which conserved both genes and C. burnetti which only conserved a ptsK gene lacking the N-terminal domain.
Considering the observed current distribution of ptsI (EIR)
and ptsP (EINtr) genes and the congruence of the topologies of both groups with the accepted branching order
observed in the 16S rRNA tree (Fig. S6, Additional file 2)
we hypothesize that ptsI (EIR) and ptsP were present in the
last common ancestor of α-, β-, δ- and γ-Proteobacteria, a
composition still found in G. sulfurreducens, and their current distribution is explained by vertical inheritance and
lineage-specific gene losses. Along the evolution of the
different proteobacterial lineages only one of these genes
was preserved: ptsI (EIR) was lost in α-Proteobacteria, except
in Gluconobacter oxidans (the ptsI genes present in Mesorhizobium loti and Bradyrhizobium japonicum are not
orthologous and they will be discussed separately), and
the same occurred in γ-Proteobacteria, with the exception
of Xanthomonadales. However, in G. oxidans, β-Proteobacteria and Xanthomonadales, the lost gene was ptsP.
There is no functional information on the role of EIR
although it has been proposed to participate, along with
HPr and HPrK, in a phosphoryl transfer chain involved in
the σ54 regulon [15]. Our analysis agrees with this proposal and provides an explanation for the displacement of
EIR by EINtr in some proteobacterial lineages. Indeed, there
are evidences indicating that EINtr is involved in regulating
the expression of genes belonging to the σ54 regulon both
in α-Proteobacteria [31] and γ-Proteobacteria [16,32].
In consequence, we hypothesize that EIR and EINtr are
functional analogs that play a regulatory role. However,
the presence of genes encoding a putative mannose-class
PTS transporter in D. vulgaris (see Fig. 5 and Fig. S4, Additional file 2) hints at the possibility that EIR also plays a
role in sugar transport [33]. Furthermore, a phylogenetic
reconstruction of IIAMan encoding genes shows that the
sequence of D. vulgaris, which is part of the putative PTS
transporter, clusters together with other IIAMan encoding
genes from α- and β-Proteobacteria located in the rpoN
gene cluster (data not shown). Therefore, these genes may
have been present in the ancestral proteobacterial cluster
and the genes encoding subunits IIB, IIC and IID were
subsequently lost in most proteobacterial lineages.

The PTS-ptc of Actinobacteria
The phylogenetic analysis of ptsI genes from Actinobacteria
shows that those genes from species belonging to the
order Actinomycetales constitute a monophyletic group
with strong support (Fig. 2). This clustering is not supported in the ptsH tree possibly due to its poor resolution
(Fig. 3). As a difference, ptsI and ptsH of Bifidobacterium
longum and Symbiobacterium thermophilum cluster separately from those of other Actinobacteria (Fig. 2 and 3).
Since the observed topology of the ptsI tree is congruent
with the expected order of organismal descent (Fig. S6,
Additional file 2) and both genes are present in most
actinobacterial species included in this study, it is likely
that both genes were present in the last common ancestor
of Actinomycetales and at least ptsI was inherited vertically.

However, the analysis of the genomic context shows different gene organizations and points towards possible
duplications or HGT events among actinobacterial species
which would have involved HPr (Fig. S7, Additional file
2). For example, Propionibacterium acnes harbors a ptsH
gene (pacneh2) which clusters with homologs from
Nocardia and Corynebacteria and it is located in a deoRfruK-fruA-ptsH operon identical to those found in these
species (Fig. 3 and Fig. S7, Additional file 2), whereas its
paralog (pacneh1) clusters with its counterparts of Streptomyces and Leifsonia xyli. Another example is given by the
fusion proteins encoded by L. xyli and Corynebacterium
diphtheriae which consist of a IIAMan domain and a C-terminal HPr domain (sequences cdiphtamh and lxylamh)
located in identical operons together with genes encoding
dihydroxyacetone kinase (Fig. S7, Additional file 2). Nevertheless, these sequences appear very distantly related to
each other and to similar proteins of Proteobacteria in the
HPr tree (Fig. 3). In summary, these results suggest that
HGT or lineage-specific duplications affecting ptsH have
occurred in Actinobacteria but currently available data are
insufficient to ascertain this point.
A PTS system in Archaea
H. marismortui harbors in plasmid pNG700 a gene cluster
encoding a fructose-class PTS transporter, EI and HPr (Fig.
6). Nevertheless, neither the phylogenetic analyses of EI
and HPr nor the structure of the cluster provided evidence
for a clear relationship to any of their bacterial counterparts. In contrast to other fructose PTS gene clusters discussed below, EI and HPr do not constitute a MTP;
likewise, the constituents of the transporter are not
encoded by fusion genes, in contrast to that found in the
other fructose clusters studied here (see Fig. 6 and Fig. S8,
Additional file 2). The phylogenetic analysis placed H.
marismortui EI as a basal branch of MTPs containing IIAMan
domains (Fig. 2) whereas HPr clustered with actinobacterial sequences. Furthermore, the lengths of the branches
of these genes in their corresponding trees are comparable

to those of their bacterial counterparts and far shorter
than it would be expected for archaeal genes (see for
example, Fig. S6, Additional file 2). Therefore, although
the phylogenetic analyses and the uniqueness of this
operon in Archaea indicate that this operon is of bacterial
origin, the currently available data do not allow a more
precise identification of its source.
MTPs containing IIAFru or IIAGlu domains
MTPs can be divided into three main groups: proteins
containing N-terminal IIAFru or IIAGlu domains, proteins
containing IIAMan N-terminal domains and proteins containing C-terminal IIAFru domains. MTPs containing one
or two N-terminal IIAFru domains (encoded by fruB) are
typically associated to fructose-class PTS transporters
(encoded by fruA) and 1-phospho fructokinases (fruK; see
Fig. 6 and Fig. S8, Additional file 2). The functional information available from E. coli [34], Rhodobacter capsulatus
[35], Salmonella typhimurium [36] and Xanthomonas campestris [37,38] indicates that all these transporters internalize fructose.

The prototypic FruB proteins (usually termed FPr) of
Enterobacteriaceae and Vibrionaceae are composed of a IIAFru domain separated by an intervening domain from a Cterminal HPr domain (Fig. 6 and Fig. S8, Additional file
2). In Pasteurellaceae, these proteins have undergone some
modifications: FPr proteins from Haemophilus influenzae
and Mannheimia succiniproducens carry duplicated HPr
domains which possibly resulted from a relatively recent

duplication [39]. In Pseudomonas, FruB proteins consist of
two IIAFru domains arranged in tandem and fused to a central HPr domain and a C-terminal EI domain (Fig. 6 and
Fig. S8, Additional file 2). This second IIAFru domain (IIAFru') is apparently absent in the closely related Acinetobacter
sp. However, the alignment of enterobacterial FPr proteins together with those of Pasteurellaceae, Pseudomonas
and Acinetobacter reveals that the intervening domain is in
fact a heavily altered, remnant of the IIAFru' domain (Fig.
S9, Additional file 2). Interestingly, the cognate FruA
transporters also possess duplicated IIB domains even in
those organisms whose phosphoryl transfer proteins carry
only one functional IIAFru domain [37,40]. At least in E.
coli both IIB domains are required for full activity [34].
The phylogenetic reconstructions of the EI domains of
these proteins along with the structure of the fru gene clusters strongly suggest that all FruB evolved from a common
ancestor consisting of duplicated IIA domains fused to
HPr and EI domains. This ancestral form is conserved in
Pseudomonas. FruB genes harboured by Chromobacterium
violaceum, D. radiodurans, Ralstonia solanacearum and Xanthomonas probably evolved from a common ancestor
where the IIAFru' domain was removed. Finally, the EI
domain was lost in Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae and
Vibrionaceae giving rise to FPr. Reasons for this proposal
will be discussed in the section dedicated to group T. The
phylogenetic relationships inferred from the sequences of
FPr proteins are in agreement with the most accepted
order of organismal descent represented by the 16S rRNA

phylogeny (Fig. S6, Additional file 2). Therefore it is reasonable to assume that the fru operon was present in the
last common ancestor of these families and FruB was
modified to its current structure before the differentiation
of these lineages.
Similarly, the phylogenetic position of proteins containing IIAGlu N-terminal domains suggests that they evolved
from a FruB ancestor by substitution of the IIAFru domain
by a IIAGlu domain. This hypothesis is based on their
branching within the FruB group (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2, Additional file 2).
In summary, the phylogenetic analysis does not allow
establishing a clear origin for MTPs containing N-terminal
IIAFru or IIAGlu domains. The strong support for this cluster
(BS = 97%; BPP = 1.00; see Fig. 2) indicates that they originated from a common ancestor and, since most MTPs are
harbored by Proteobacteria, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that these genes evolved from a proteobacterial
ancestor. However, the phylogenetic analyses do not provide evidence for a close relationship of either the EI or the

HPr domains of MTPs containing N-terminal IIAFru or
IIAGlu domains to any other EI or HPr paralogs present in
Proteobacteria.
MTPs with a IIAFru C-terminal domain constitute a monophyletic group with strong support in both EI and HPr
trees and with no clear phylogenetic relationship to other
MTPs. Hence, they were possibly assembled independently of MTPs containing N-terminal IIA domains.
MTPs containing IIAMan domains
MTPs containing IIAMan domains are invariably associated
to genes encoding dihydroxyacetone kinases (Fig. 7). This
group also includes the YcgC proteins present in E. coli
strains which lack the EI domain [41]. The phylogenetic
analysis of HPr domains showed strong support for this
group (BS = 97%; BPP = 1.00; Fig. 3) and indicated that
these proteins evolved from a common ancestor.

The phylogenetic reconstruction of ptsI sequences shows
that a gene encoding a fusion protein consisting of an HPr
N-terminal domain and an EI C-terminal domain from

Mesorhizobium loti (sequences mlotih3 and mloti1, HPr
and EI domains, respectively) clusters with this group.
This gene is located in an operon together with a cluster of
genes encoding a glucitol-class PTS transporter (Fig. 7). It
is feasible that the MTP present in the glucitol-class PTS
evolved from an ancestor containing a IIAMan domain
which was subsequently lost. Interestingly, M. loti encodes
a second EI (mloti2) which constitutes an operon with an
HPr encoding gene (mlotih2) and genes encoding dihydroxyacetone kinase. An identical cluster is present in
Bradyrhizobium japonicum (bjapo and bjapoh1; Fig. 7).
None of the EI and HPr present in these clusters grouped
with IIAMan MTPs. In order to determine whether these
sequences had a significantly accelerated evolutionary rate
in comparison to MTPs containing IIAMan domains, a
Tajima's relative rate test was carried out by comparing
sequences mloti1, mloti2 and bjapo with that of Vibrio
parahaemolyticus (vparaamhe) using an E. coli MTP with a
C-terminal IIAFru domain (ecolcheag) as an outgroup. The
test revealed that none of these sequences were significantly accelerated (p = 0. 346, p = 0.448 and p = 0.206, for
mloti1, mloti2 and bjapo, respectively). Therefore, the
origin of the ptsH and ptsI genes present in the dihydroxyacetone kinase-encoding clusters of M. loti and B. japonicum cannot be further elucidated from the available data.
The evolution of group T: vertical inheritance in
Firmicutes and transference to γ-Proteobacteria
The T group (EIT) includes all Firmicutes sequences, F.
nucleatum, Borrelia and EI encoding genes from Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellaceae and Vibrionaceae. This group had
low bootstrap support although it was strongly supported
in the Bayesian analysis (BS = 38%, BPP = 1.00). The phylogenetic analysis of ptsI indicates that Firmicutes constitute a monophyletic group although with low support in
some branches (Fig. S2, Additional file 2). The splits network (not shown, available upon request) also indicated
conflicting signals in this group deriving from the difficulties in determining the phylogenetic relationships among
Bacilli, Clostridia and Mollicutes. Despite the presence of
incongruence, the monophyly of Firmicutes is also
observed in the ptsH topology. Furthermore, the phylogenetic reconstruction of EIT of Firmicutes agrees with the
expected order of organismal descent for this group (Fig.
S6, Additional file 2). Taken together, these data suggest
that ptsH and ptsI evolved as a single unit in Firmicutes, as
reflected by the agreement of both topologies, and that
vertical inheritance has been their primary mode of transmission.

In contrast, the ptsK sequences of Clostridiales and Bacillales cluster together in the phylogenetic whereas Mollicutes
form a distinct cluster together with ptsK sequences of αProteobacteria (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, the inspection of ptsK
gene clusters suggests a closer relationship between Molli-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/147

cutes and other Firmicutes (Fig. 8 and Figs. S10 and S11,
Additional file 2). In Bacillales and Lactobacillales, ptsK is
always found with lgt, an arrangement also found in Mollicutes. Moreover, the common occurrence of ptsK together
with uvrA and uvrB on one hand and trxB on the other
observed in Bacillales is also found in many Mollicutes.
Group T genes are also present in a limited number of γProteobacteria families. In addition, the analysis of HPr
sequences provides evidence for a close relationship of
Shewanella oneidensis ptsH to this group (Fig. S3, Additional file 2) although the corresponding EI sequence did
not cluster within the T group (Fig. 2). On the other hand,
S. oneidensis harbors a ptsHIcrr operon identical to those
present in group T γ-Proteobacteria (Fig. 9 and Fig. S12,
Additional file 2). In order to better understand the basis
of this discrepancy a Tajima's relative rate test was carried
out by comparing the sequence of S. oneidensis (soneid)
with that of Vibrio cholerae (vcholer) using F. nucleatum
(fnucleat) as an outgroup. The test revealed that this
sequence (soneid) is significantly accelerated (p < 0.001)
with respect to their enterobacterial counterparts, a phenomenon that usually results in unexpected, and incorrect, positions in phylogenetic reconstructions. Therefore,
the ptsI gene of S. oneidensis possibly shares the same origin than other proteobacterial EIT encoding genes
although it has diverged extremely. In summary, phylogenetic and gene content analyses suggest that HPr and EIT
from Vibrionaceae, Pasteurellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae and
Shewanella (hereafter called VPES group) evolved from a
common ancestor.
Phylogenetic trees show that VPES sequences cluster
together with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Borrelia
sequences as their closest and basal relatives. This group
forms a sister clade with Firmicutes in both EI and HPr
trees (Figs. 2 and 3 and Figs. S2 and S3, Additional file 2)
and the network analyses also provided evidence for a
close relationship of these genes. The topology of the tree
of EIT sequences of VPES as an ingroup was compatible
with the order of organismal descent inferred from the
16S rRNA (p = 0.437 in the Shimodaira-Hasegawa test;
Fig. S5C, Additional file 2). Discrepancies between the
two trees were limited to the positions of some species
within the same family.
The observed clustering of genes from such distant lineages can be explained either by an ancestral duplication of
EI and HPr in their last common ancestor and subsequent
loss in all intervening lineages or by a transfer from Firmicutes or Fusobacteria to the last common ancestor of VPES.
We did not observe significant differences in nucleotide
composition or codon usage in EIT sequences from VPES
(results not shown) and, as far as we know, these genes
have not been detected as horizontally transferred by

other researchers [42,43], thus favoring the hypothesis of
an ancestral duplication. However, a HGT event is the
most parsimonious explanation since it requires a single
gain in the last common ancestor of the VPES group
whereas the alternative scenario requires multiple, independent losses in other lineages. In this sense, it is worth
noting that the group VPES coincides with the superorder
lower γ-Proteobacteria proposed by Jensen and collaborators [44] further substantiating the idea that VPES constitute a monophyletic group within γ-Proteobacteria. The
failure to detect ptsH or ptsI as horizontally transferred to
VPES by parametric methods can be explained by amelioration [45,46] since the putative HGT event would have
occurred before the differentiation of the VPES lineages.
In summary, the phylogenetic analyses and the observed
distribution of EIT and HPr-encoding genes suggest that
these genes were transferred to the last common ancestor
of VPES from Fusobacteria or Firmicutes.

On the other hand, Borrelia species harbor identical ptsHptsI-ccr operons to the ones found in VPES (Fig. 9 and Fig.
S12, Additional file 2). Furthermore, Borrelia possesses
additional ptsH genes (sequences bburgdh2 and
bgarinh2) which are very distantly related to their counterparts and are located in gene clusters together with rpoN
(Fig. 9). The presence of this second ptsH gene in a gene
cluster similar to that found in other Spirochaetales, the
absence of the ptsH-ptsI-ccr operon in other spirochaetes
and the phylogenetic positions of both ptsH and ptsI close
to their VPES counterparts suggest that Borrelia acquired
this operon via HGT from VPES.
The acquisition of the ptsH-ptsI operon by VPES possibly
propelled a number of evolutionary novelties in this
group. Members of VPES harbor the largest number of PTS
transporters in their genomes among Proteobacteria [7].
Phylogenetic analyses of some of these transporters have

revealed extensive gene exchanges between VPES and Firmicutes [26]. Furthermore, some MTPs are in a process of
reduction in VPES. As indicated above, FPr and YcgC
evolved from proteins which contained EI domains. We
hypothesize that the acquisition of the ptsH and ptsI genes
enabled the expansion of PTS transporters by HGT and/or
duplication and differentiation, and it also made the EI
domains of some MTPs dispensable as EIT took over their
function. Most relevantly, EIT and HPr also participate in
CCR in Firmicutes and VPES. Interestingly, CCR in VPES
differs markedly from other closely related proteobacterial groups such as Pseudomonadales [47,48]. Moreover,
VPES encode a particular type of adenylate cyclase not
related to other adenylate cyclases [49] and which is only
found in a few species outside this group. Hence, we
hypothesize that the transfer of EIT and its cognate HPrencoding genes was a key event in the appearance of a
novel CCR pathway, an evolutionary novelty only shared
by the VPES group.
Our hypothesis does not contradict the complexity
hypothesis which proposes that genes have different
probabilities of being transferred depending on how

many interacting partners their products have in the cell
[50]. The analysis of the metabolic network of E. coli has
shown that the success of a HGT event depends on the
pathway affected, so that laterally transferred genes that
intervene in a peripheral pathway [51] or having physiologically interacting partners already present in the receptor genome [52] are more likely to be fixed. However, the
complexity hypothesis does not preclude that a HGTacquired peripheral pathway might evolve into a complex
regulatory network. In our view, the EIT phosphoryl transfer chain would originally have a limited role in glucose
transport in VPES. However, the great plasticity of the EITHPr phosphoryl transfer chain would facilitate the expansion of a regulatory network in an environment where
PTS-ptc networks already existed. In this sense it is worth
noting that EIT and HPr can phosphorylate NPr and IIANtr
whereas EINtr and NPr cannot replace EIT [6].

Conclusion
Phylogenetic analyses were not sufficient to reliably disentangle the deepest relationships among the PTS-ptc genes
present in extant organisms. Nevertheless, the complementation of phylogenetic analyses with functional infor-

mation and analyses of the genomic context has allowed
us to derive several conclusions.
Our results have provided evidence for an early origin of
the PTS-ptc in Bacteria and have shown that, while in
some lineages such as Firmicutes this system has undergone very few modifications, in other lineages, such as
Proteobacteria, major changes have occurred including the
displacement of EIR by EINtr in some lineages and the
acquisition of a PTS-ptc from Fusobacteria or Firmicutes by
an ancestor of VPES which drove a number of evolutionary novelties in these bacteria. We consider that this is an
excellent example illustrating that horizontally transferred
components of peripheral metabolic pathways can evolve
into complex regulatory networks in the physiological
core of bacteria.

Methods
Sequences
We have analyzed 222 complete genomes from 172 different prokaryotic species (see Table S1, Additional file 1)
retrieved from the NCBI repository (on October 2004). EI,
HPr, and HprK encoding genes were retrieved from whole
genomes by using PSI-BLAST and TBLASTN [53,54]. The
PSI-BLAST searches were performed against the GenBank
database using the E. coli EI and HPr sequences (Acc. N°
NP_416911 and NP_416910, respectively) and the Bacillus subtilis HPrK sequence (Acc. N° NP_391380) as query
sequences with default settings. The searches were iterated
until convergence was attained. From all the sequences
retrieved, only those from whole genomes were selected,
and these sequences were subsequently filtered attending
to the presence of their characteristic domains
(pfam02896, pfam05524, and pfam00391 for EI;
pfam00381 for HPr and pfam07475 for HPrK) or a coverage of at least 75% of the query sequence. Subsequently,
additional PSI-BLAST searches using the most distant
selected sequences were performed in order to retrieve
possible homologs not identified in the first search.
Finally, TBLASTN searches were performed against the
available complete genome sequences using the same
query sequences as for the PSI-BLAST searches. The corresponding 16S rRNA sequences from each genome were
also downloaded. Detailed information on the sequences
used in these analyses, accession numbers, and domain
structure is provided in Table S2, Additional file 1. In a
few cases, possible frame-shifts in putative coding
sequences were corrected (see Table S2, Additional file 1),
and the translated products were used in this study. The
data sets were refined by excluding redundant sequences.
Alignment and phylogenetic information analysis
Multiple alignments were obtained with ClustalW [55]
and manually corrected where necessary. Positions of
doubtful homology or introducing phylogenetic noise

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/147

due to an excessive number of gaps were removed using
Gblocks [56] with default settings for the EI alignment.
However, due to the short length of HPr and HPrK
sequences we decided to apply only a manual refinement
to the corresponding alignments in order to keep a maximum number of positions for analysis. The final multiple
alignments used for the analyses are available from the
authors upon request.
The phylogenetic signal contained in the different data
sets was assessed by likelihood mapping [57] using TreePuzzle 5.2 [58] with the JTT model [59] of amino acid
evolution and a discrete gamma distribution to account
for heterogeneity in evolutionary rates among positions in
the multiple alignments. In addition, a phylogenetic network of each protein was reconstructed using the JTT
model to compute pairwise distances and the neighbornet algorithm [60]. Splitstree4 [61] was used to represent
the networks. This network analysis allows screening for
possible non tree-like evolutionary events and the influence of phylogenetic noise [62].
Functional annotation of genes associated to PTS-ptc
encoding gene clusters was verified by BLAST searches. In
addition, functional domains were identified using CDSearch [63].
Phylogeny reconstruction
In order to obtain accurate phylogenies, the best fit models of amino acid substitution were selected using the program ProtTest [64]. The Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC), which allows for a comparison of likelihoods from
non-nested models, was adopted to select the best model
[65] that was rtREV [28] for the three protein sets. The
selected model was implemented in PHYML [66] to
obtain maximum likelihood trees for the different alignments. Bootstrap support values were obtained from 1000
pseudo replicates.

MrBayes 3.1.2 [67] was used to obtain posterior probabilities of the nodes in the ML trees based on a Bayesian
methodology. The program approximates the posterior
probabilities of the phylogenetic trees using a Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. For the three alignments we used the same model used in PHYML in two
replicates running four chains during a number of generations enough to ensure convergence of the sampled
parameters. Convergence was verified using Tracer 1.4
[68] and accepted when the effective sample size of all the
parameters was larger than 100, the recommended minimum effective size [68]. EI, HPr and HprK required 2.4 ×
106, 2.8 × 106 and 1 × 106 generations, respectively. Once
convergence was assessed, the two runs were combined to
obtain an estimate of the posterior distribution of the dif-

ferent parameters and the tree topology, with the first 10%
samples discarded as burn-in.
For selected groups we carried out a comparison between
the gene tree phylogeny and the 16S rRNA topology as a
reference tree for the corresponding species. ShimodairaHasegawa's test [69] implemented in the program TreePuzzle 5.2 was used to determine whether the likelihood of
the data associated to the two test trees was significantly
different at an alpha level of 0.05 (a value above the
threshold indicating a non-significant difference). Phylogenetic trees of sequences encoding 16S rRNA were
obtained using the tools implemented in the Ribosomal
Database Project II [70] and compared to maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees of the corresponding EI
sequences obtained as indicated above. Since the Tree
Builder tool of the Ribosomal Database Project has a limit
of fifty sequences, in order to obtain a phylogenetic tree
encompassing all species encoding a PTS-ptc, sequences
of genes encoding 16S rRNA were aligned using ClustalW
and their phylogenetic relationships were inferred using
the PHYML maximum likelihood algorithm under the
GTR model of nucleotide substitution and proportion of
invariant and rate heterogeneity categories estimated from
the data set. Support for the nodes in the resulting topologies was assessed by analyzing 500 bootstrap pseudo
replicates.

Preliminary analyses suggested that some sequences
might have experienced an accelerated rate of evolution
with respect to other sequences in the alignment. In order
to explore this possibility, Tajima's relative rate tests [71]
were carried out.
