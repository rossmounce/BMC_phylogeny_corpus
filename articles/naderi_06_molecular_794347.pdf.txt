Abstract
Genetic and phylogenetic information on the HIV-1 epidemic in Middle-East Countries, and in
particular in Iran, are extremely limited. By March 2004, the Iranian Ministry of Health officially
reported a cumulative number of 6'532 HIV positive individuals and 214 AIDS cases in the Iranian
HIV-1 epidemic. The intra-venous drug users (IDUs) represent the group at highest risk for HIV-1
infection in Iran, accounting for almost 63% of all HIV-infected population. In this regards, a
molecular phylogenetic study has been performed on a sentinel cohort of HIV-1 seropositive IDUs
enrolled at the end of 2005 at the University of Mashhad, the largest city North East of Tehran.
The study has been performed on both gag and env subgenomic regions amplified by Polymerase
Chain Reaction (PCR) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and characterized by
direct DNA sequence analysis. The results reported here show that the HIV-1 subtype A is
circulating in this IDUs sentinel cohort. Moreover, the single phylogenetic cluster as well as the
intra-group low nucleotide divergence is indicative of a recent outbreak. Unexpectedly, the Iranian
samples appear to be phylogenetically derived from African Sub-Saharan subtype A viruses, raising
stirring speculations on HIV-1 introduction into the IDUs epidemic in Mashhad. This sentinel study
could represent the starting point for a wider molecular survey of the HIV-1 epidemics in Iran to
evaluate in detail the distribution of genetic subtypes and possible natural drug-resistant variants,
which are extremely helpful information to design diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

Background
The first case of HIV/AIDS in Iran was reported in 1987 in
a 6-year-old child with hemophilia and since then, the
number of HIV infections in Iran has increased exponentially within the hemophiliacs group [1]. After the introduction in 1989 of the mandatory blood (and its
derivatives) screening for HIV-1 positivity, the HIV-1

spread among hemophiliacs has dramatically dropped
and the intra-venous drug users (IDUs) have progressively
become the group at highest risk for HIV-1 infection
(62.8% of all reported infections) [1]. In particular, the
needle sharing among inmate IDUs represents a specific
high risk behavior for HIV-1 transmission in Iran [2,3].
Furthermore, in the last years the HIV infection is increas-

ingly spread in the Iranian population through sexual
route (7.3% of all reported cases), although a considerable number of infections (26.1%) are reported to be transmitted through unknown routes [4]. By March 2004, the
Iranian Ministry of Health officially reported a cumulative
number of 6'532 HIV positive individuals and 214 AIDS
cases [5,6]. However, the latest report from UNAIDS estimates a number of HIV/AIDS cases in Iran which could be
as much as four times higher than those officially registered [7].
Limited data are available on HIV-1 subtype distribution
in the Middle East region where the B and C subtypes are
prevalent, with the exception of Lebanon where the A subtype is predominant [8]. Molecular epidemiology studies
are extremely important to know the HIV-1 subtype distribution in a specific population/region which may significantly influence the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
In fact, a correlation between HIV-1 genetic subtypes and
natural resistance to antiretroviral drugs, as well as efficiency of diagnostic serological and molecular tests, has
been observed [9-12]. Moreover, the degree of cross-protection induced by vaccines, based on subtypes not predominant in the target population, is still a debated
matter [13].
In this regards, a molecular phylogenetic study has been
performed on a sentinel cohort of Iranian HIV-1 seropositive IDUs enrolled at the end of 2005 at the University of
Mashhad, the largest city northeast of Tehran. Blood samples were obtained from 12 HIV-1 positive patients
attending the Department of Infectious Diseases, Imam
Reza General Hospital where the HIV-1 infection was
diagnosed by immunological methods (ELISA, Western
blot) and the CD4+ T-cell population counted. At the
enrollment, all of them declared to live in Mashhad and
to be IDUs, except one patient who reported a homosex-

ual behavior. Some of them have spent few years in
prison, representing an IDU specific high risk group
within the Iranian HIV-1 epidemic [2,3]. The full designation of samples, according to WHO-proposed nomenclature, is MSH05.00XE or MSH05.00XG, where 05 stands
for the year of study and E (or G) stands for env (or gag).
For the sake of simplicity, however, in this paper the samples have been indicated only with the isolate's number
(e.g., 001) (Table 1).
DNA was extracted at the Imam Reza General Hospital
from 5 × 106 peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) by the QIAamp DNA blood kit (Qiagen,
Alameda, CA – USA), according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The quality of target DNA was verified by
PCR amplification of p53 housekeeping cellular gene as
routinely performed at the INT in Naples, prior to viral
genes amplification [14,15].
The hypervariable C2-V5 region of the HIV-1 env gene
(667 bp) and the fragment spanning the p24 and p7
region of the gag gene (460 bp) have been amplified from
approximately 1 μg of purified DNA (corresponding to
1.5 × 105 cells) by nested PCR, as previously described
[14,15]. The DNA nucleotide sequence analysis has been
performed on uncloned PCR products to identify the
prevalent viral quasispecie. Nucleotide sequences (appr.
300 nucleotides) were aligned using CLUSTAL W [16],
with minor manual adjustments, and pairwise compared
to HIV-1 reference standards of different subtypes available through the Los Alamos Database [17]. Sites with gaps
in any of the sequences, as well as areas of uncertain alignment, were excluded from all sequence comparisons. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the neighbor joining
method [18] and the Tree View software application was
used to draw dendrograms. Genetic distances were calculated with Kimura's two-parameter method [19].

All Mashhad samples were positive for the highly conserved p24 gag subgenomic region, with the exception of
the 005 sample; on the contrary, only 7 out of 12 samples
(58.3%) were positive for the C2-V5 env subgenomic
region. An alternative primer pair (ED5-ED12) in the first
amplification round and less stringent annealing conditions (45°C vs 55°C) yielded the amplification of the env
subgenomic region from 2 additional samples, from the 5
previously negative ones (Table 1). The negative amplification results in gag (MSH05) or env (MSH01, 09, 11)
subgenomic regions could be explained by a significant
number of nucleotide substitutions or deletions in the
primers' target sequence, resulting in an inefficient
primer-to-target annealing.
The HIV-1 samples identified in Mashhad were analyzed
by phylogenetic analysis performed on both gag and env

subgenomic regions (approx. 300 bp), which have been
repeatedly shown to be informative for an accurate subtype classification [14,15]. All Mashhad HIV-1 samples
phylogenetically cluster with reference sequences of A
subtype in gag as well as env subgenomic regions, showing
no close phylogenetic relations with reference sequences
of neither A sub-subtypes (A2, A3, A4) nor A-based circulating recombinant forms (Fig. 1A and 1B). Considering
that most of the CRFs show a discordant phylogenetic
classification in the gag and env subgenomic regions [20],
the consistent clustering in the A subtype observed in the
present study suggests the absence of intra-genomic
recombination events which, however, need to be confirmed by near full-length sequence analyses. The Mashhad samples group in a single cluster indicating a strong
phylogenetic correlation and a recent introduction of the
HIV-1 infection in this community with a limited genetic

evolution of the circulating virus. This observation is further confirmed by the overall low nucleotide divergence
in env (10.8%, ± 2.39%) and gag (3.56%, ± 1.52%) subgenomic regions of virus samples identified in the present
cohort study. In particular, within the Mashhad cluster, a
single variant pair (007 – 010) is observed in both gag and
env phylogenetic trees. The genetic relationship between
these two viral variants is further supported by the
extremely limited nucleotide divergence (10.1% in env
and 2.16% in gag), which strongly suggest a possible interpersonal direct transmission of the HIV-1 virus, although
this is not confirmed by anamnestic data.
In order to identify the possible geographic origin of the
founder virus of HIV-1 epidemic in Mashhad, a phylogenetic analysis was performed including a larger number of

A-subtype reference sequences from Sub-Saharan African
Countries along with sequences from Eastern European
and Middle-East Countries. Unexpectedly, the Mashhad
cluster is closely related to the African Sub-Saharan
viruses, with any phylogenetic correlation to the Eastern
European and Middle-East variants. In particular, the
Ugandan UG037 isolate is strongly correlated to the
founder of the epidemic (Fig. 2A and 2B). This is further
supported by the 100% homology in the amino acid composition of the V3 Loop tip between the consensus of
Mashhad and sub-Saharan sequences (GPGQAFYAT),
while the East European consensus sequence shows an Ato-T amino acid substitution (GPGQTFYAT) [21].

regions, suggest that the HIV-1 epidemic currently affecting the risk groups for HIV-1 infection in Iran (predominantly IDUs) is driven by viral variants of the A subtype.
Furthermore, the strong phylogenetic correlation between
the Mashhad and the sub-Saharan isolates (in particular
Ugandan) supports the possibility that the founder virus
has been introduced from African Countries more than
from the neighboring Countries, which instead represent
the main source of A-subtype variants in the whole European Continent. A similar phylogenetic link to African
isolates of A-subtype variants identified in Tehran has
been recently reported also by Sarrami-Forooshani et al.,
although a geographic origin from Former Soviet Union
Countries has been proposed [22]. Considering the African origin of all A-subtype HIV-1 epidemics, this hypothesis could be supported by a HIV-1 speciation occurred at
a different rate in the distinct regional epidemics, which,
at this stage, is not supported by solid epidemiological
data. Therefore, assuming a similar HIV-1 speciation rate
in Iran and neighboring Countries, the phylogenetic pattern described in the present study, together with the
results reported by Sarrami-Forooshani et al., would
strongly suggest an independent and more recent direct
introduction of African A subtype virus in Iran. This could
possibly be correlated to the relevant role played by this
Country, in particular Mashhad, in the Muslim religious
culture.
These results on a sentinel cohort need to be confirmed by
a nationwide molecular survey to verify the real distribution of A subtype in the country as well as in other risk
groups (Homo- and heterosexuals groups). This molecular epidemiological information will be extremely relevant to guide the development and implementation of
diagnostic as well as preventive/therapeutic approaches in
Iran.
