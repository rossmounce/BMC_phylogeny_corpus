Abstract
Background: Medicinal leeches became infamous for their utility in bloodletting popularized in the
19th century, and have seen a recent resurgence in post-operative treatments for flap and
replantation surgeries, and in terms of characterization of salivary anticoagulants. Notorious
throughout the world, the quintessential leech family Hirudinidae has been taken for granted to be
monophyletic, as has the non-bloodfeeding family Haemopidae.
Results: This study is the first to evaluate molecular evidence from hirudinid and haemopid leeches
in a manner that encompasses the global scope of their taxonomic distributions. We evaluated the
presumed monophyly of the Hirudinidae and assessed previous well-accepted classification
schemes. The Hirudinidae were found not to be monophyletic, falling instead into two distinct and
unrelated clades. Members of the non-bloodfeeding family Haemopidae were scattered throughout
the tree and among traditional hirudinid genera. A combination of nuclear 18S rDNA and 28S
rDNA with mitochondrial 12S rDNA and cytochrome c oxidase I were analyzed with Parsimony
and with Bayesian methods.
Conclusion: The family Hirudinidae must be refined to include only the clade containing Hirudo
medicinalis (European medicinal leech) and related leeches irrespective of bloodfeeding behavior. A
second clade containing Macrobdella decora (North American medicinal leech) and its relatives may
yet be recognized in Semiscolecidae in order to avoid paraphyly. The African distribution of species
from each of the divergent hirudinid clades suggests that a deep divergence took place in the history
of the medicinal leeches hundreds of millions of years ago.

Background
"Medicinal leech" is a common name that describes
bloodfeeding clitellate annelids in the family Hirudinidae
of the order Hirudinida. The use of leeches for bloodletting has been a part of Western medicine since Galen [1].
Indeed, the word "leech" is actually derived from the Old
English word, lœce, for physician (Merriam-Webster Dictionary). Their utility has also been recorded in several
Eastern traditions, having been documented in the Char-

aka Samhita (Maurya period, roughly 3rd century BCE) as
one of five treatments for an imbalance of humors and by
Wang Ch'ung (27-100 A.D) [2]. François-Joseph-Victor
Broussais, physician to Napoleon and his troops, was the
major proponent of leeching in Europe, particularly in the
early 1800s, during which he was infamous for using copious numbers of leeches during Napoleon's campaign
through Europe [3]. As little as five and up to 50 leeches
at a time were used for patients suffering from various

conditions until Pierre Charles Alexander Louis and contemporaries finally questioned the effectiveness of phlebotomy as a cure-all; the practice was not curbed until
approximately 100 years later [4,5].
As a result of their great medical popularity during the
18th and 19th centuries, European leech populations were
over-harvested and leeches became increasingly scarce in
parts of Western Europe. Consequently, various countries,
such as Italy, Hungary, and Poland, with seemingly abundant sources, began exporting large numbers in order to
satisfy the high demand. As early as 1823, restrictions
were put in place to manage the number of leeches being
exported through Hannover, Germany, and collecting seasons were instituted in Russia; these represent some of the
first measures in history meant to conserve an animal species [6].
The clinical use of leeches was revived by Derganc and
Zdravic [7] to relieve post-operative venous congestion in
patients recovering from tissue flap and replantation surgery. Their application in this regard proved so successful
that European medicinal leeches were approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration in June, 2004 as a medical
device due to their mechanically relieving venous congestion and delivering anti-coagulants [8]. The powerful anticoagulants in leech salivary secretions have been of interest since the anti-thrombin, hirudin, was purified [9]. The
first human dialysis treatment accomplished by Haas [10]
was only possible in light of the newly available purified
hirudin, though it would later be supplanted by widely
available and less expensive heparin.

The namesake of the family Hirudinidae, Hirudo medicinalis Linnaeus, 1758 (European Medicinal Leech), is the species most commonly referenced for its use in medicine,
though a recent study [11,12] found the commercially distributed leech used in most Western hospitals is Hirudo
verbana Carena 1820, not H. medicinalis. In fact, within the
family Hirudinidae, approximately 200 species have been
described from all continents, save for Antarctica. Some of
these species are used in medical practices in place of
Hirudo species where they are abundant (e.g., Richardsonianus australis (Bosisto, 1859), Hirudinaria manillensis (Lesson, 1842), and Hirudo nipponia Whitman 1886 [13]).

leech Macrobdella decora (Say, 1824) to be only distantly
related to H. medicinalis. Borda and Siddall's [17] analyses
found the family Hirudinidae to be split into two major
clades with the terrestrial leeches and the non-bloodfeeding Haemopidae falling in between. All taxonomic revisions of the family until now have been performed only
with morphological characters [e.g., [14,15,18]]. Here, we
revisit the phylogenetic relationships and systematics of
the family Hirudinidae while testing the monophyly of
the family, and for the first time utilizing an expanded
taxon sampling from each continent with representatives
of most previously proposed subfamilies.

Traditionally, the family Hirudinidae included any sanguivorous, swimming, freshwater leech with three jaws
(one dorsal and two ventrolateral) and a distinctively caecate crop. Richardson [14] separated the Hirudinidae into
five families, which Sawyer [15] made into new combinations and subfamilies of the family Hirudinidae based on
sexual morphology and geographic distributions (Figure
1). Apakupakul et al. [16] suggested that the Hirudinidae
is polyphyletic, finding the North American medicinal

Results
The combined dataset had a total of 6086 characters (18S:
2034 characters, 28S: 2162 characters, 12S: 575 characters, CO1: 1315 characters). The Parsimony analysis produced 9 equally parsimonious trees with 8266 steps while
the harmonic mean of log-likelihood values from two
runs of the Bayesian (BI) analysis averaged -44555.69. The
log-likelihood of the topology produced by the Maximum
Likelihood analysis was -43311.984.

Parsimony and BI methods largely agreed in terms of the
tree topology, including that the family Hirudinidae was
not monophyletic (Figure 2). In parsimony, monophyly
of an a priori presumed-monophyletic Hirudinidae would
require 179 extra steps (Templeton test: z = -8.299, P >
0.0001). The harmonic mean of log-likelihood values
constraining traditional hirudinids to be monophyletic
was -45054.72 (yielding a Bayes Factor of -998.06). Similarly, with this constraint under the likelihood criterion,
monophyly of Hirudinidae was rejected with Treefinder
[19], in that P-values were highly significant (ShimodiaraHasegawa < 0.000001, approximately unbiased test <
0.000001). The harmonic mean of log-likelihood values
constraining traditional hirudinids and traditional haemopids together to be a monophyletic group was 44589.01 (yielding a Bayes Factor of -66.64). Similarly,
with this constraint under the likelihood criterion, monophyly of Hirudinidae+Haemopidae was rejected with
Treefinder [19], in that P-values, while not as profound as
in the simple case of constraining Hirudinidae to be
monophyletic, still were significant at the 5% level (Shimodiara-Hasegawa = 0.0195, approximately unbiased
test = 0.0164).
Hirudinid taxa placed among two strongly supported
clades (Figure 2). One clade contained the genera Macrobdella, Philobdella, Oxyptychus, Semiscolex, Patagoniobdella,
Limnobdella, and Limnatis. A second clade contained the
genera Aliolimnatis, Asiaticobdella, Hirudinaria, Goddardobdella, Hirudo, Whitmania, and Haemopis. The precise placement of the genus Haemopis varied among analyses and
received little support in each of Parsimony (jackknife =
32) and BI (pp = 0.54) analyses. Between the two principal hirudinid clades was a paraphyletic assemblage of terrestrial leeches in the families Haemadipsidae and
Xerobdellidae. The Parsimony analysis found the genus
Haemopis to be sister to the Hirudo clade (including Whitmania laevis (Baird, 1869)), whereas the BI analyses found
the genus Haemopis sister to a clade comprised of the genera Aliolimnatis, Asiaticobdella, Goddardobdella, and Hirudinaria, exclusive of the genus Hirudo. Species-level
disagreements were apparent between the Parsimony
analysis and the BI analyses involving species of Hirudo as
well as species of Aliolimnatis and Asiaticobdella. Regardless
of optimality criterion, within the Hirudo clade were the
various European Hirudo species along with the Asian H.
nipponia, which itself was sister to the Asian non-sanguivorous W. laevis (traditionally Haemopidae). Within its
own clade, H. manillensis individuals were clustered by
locality with Caribbean individuals closely related to
those from Thailand. Representatives of the genus Asiaticobdella fell within, and rendered paraphyletic, the genus
Aliolimnatis. Regardless of optimality criterion, the genera
Macrobdella, Philobdella, and Oxyptychus each were monophyletic and together formed a clade that was sister to the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/246

non-sanguivorous Semiscolescidae (also traditionally
Haemopidae) as opposed to the bloodfeeding genera,
Limnatis and Limnobdella. Mexican leeches of the genus
Limnobdella formed a monophyletic group sister to the
monophyletic genus Limnatis with high support values
(jackknife = 100; pp = 1.00).

Discussion
The family Hirudinidae, long taken for granted to be
monophyletic, is not. Hirudinid leeches, characterized as
relatively large, vermiform, swimming leeches that feed
on blood by making an incision with three armed jaws,
fall into two separate clades: one typified by the North
American M. decora and the other by the European H.
medicinalis. The Hirudinidae is represented by two independent origins of aquatic medicinal leeches, each from a
terrestrial ancestor. Both groups create spongy cocoons
that are deposited on shore, leaving the hatchlings to
search for the water in a manner similar to newly hatched
sea turtles. Also, both groups have internal insemination,
a behavior common to terrestrial organisms to prevent
sperm desiccation, unlike the aquatic leech families Glossiphoniidae and Piscicolidae that exhibit external traumatic insemination. The clade containing M. decora
includes additional New World genera, such as the South
American Oxyptychus, Semiscolex, and Patagoniobdella, as
well as the North American Macrobdella, Philobdella, and
Limnobdella. Unexpectedly, within this otherwise New
World clade is the Old World bloodfeeding genus Limnatis distributed from Eastern Europe, throughout Africa,
and eastward to the Indian subcontinent. The second
hirudinid clade contains H. medicinalis and related genera
found only in the Old World including Africa (Aliolimnatis
and Asiaticobdella spp.), Asia (Hirudinaria spp., some
Hirudo spp., and Whitmania spp.), Australia (Goddardobdella spp.), and Europe (Hirudo spp.). This polyphyly of
the family Hirudinidae is further complicated by each of
the two clades' inclusion of non-bloodfeeding taxa heretofore assigned to the family Haemopidae [15].
The deep divergence between the two hirudinid clades
was hinted at by Borda and Siddall [17] in their findings
that the Old World Limnatis nilotica (Savigny, 1822)
placed closer to the North American M. decora than to
other African species of the genus Aliolimnatis. With our
addition of members of the genus Limnobdella that group
sister to Limnatis species, the nature of this relationship is
more precise. Prior work regarding the anticoagulant profiles of various medicinal leeches may have been prescient
regarding polyphyly of the so-called "medicinal leeches".
A variety of anticoagulants have been characterized from
hirudinid leeches, with each compound targeting a different point in the clotting process [20,21]. It is generally
held that the major protease inhibitors employed by
Hirudo species and their allies block thrombin, whereas

Page 4 of 11

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:246

that for M. decora targets platelet aggregation as opposed
to the clotting cascade itself [e.g., [22,23]]. Regarding the
close association of Old World Limnatis species and New
World Limnobdella species, generalized morphological
similarities have previously been noted. Richardson and
Oosthuizen lamented in personal letters (in the possession of MES) their inability to find a synapomorphy for
the two genera that might allow them to erect a new
family.
As noted above, in addition to the polyphyletic origin of
the medicinal leeches, both hirudinid clades are paraphyletic in light of members of the family Haemopidae
placing within each group. Previously, non-bloodfeeding,
relatively large, vermiform, swimming leeches were
grouped together on the basis of their macrophagous
feeding behavior, regardless of geographic distribution.
The family Haemopidae, among other non-bloodfeeding
taxa, included the genera Haemopis, Whitmania, Semiscolex, and Patagoniobdella [15]. Our analyses demonstrate
that this family is not phylogenetically corroborated
because haemopid genera fall variously within the two
independent hirudinid clades, thus rendering them paraphyletic. Whitmania laevis is sister to a bloodfeeding species within the genus Hirudo, and not even monophyletic
with the other nearby non-bloodfeeding species of Haemopis. The macrophagous genera Semiscolex and Patagoniobdella, while monophyletic, are sister to a clade
containing the sanguivorous taxa, Oxyptychus, Macrobdella
and Philobdella. Though the ancestral hirudinid was
clearly a bloodfeeder [17], what is remarkable is the
number of times that sanguivory has been abandoned by
this group of annelids otherwise notorious for its ectoparasitic dependence on vertebrate blood. Already the loss of
sanguivory has been inferred for other groups of leeches
such as Erpobdellidae, with a predilection for chironomid
larvae, and the glossiphoniid genera Helobdella, Glossiphonia, and Alboglossiphonia that prefer the hemolymph of
gastropods or other annelids. Even the terrestrial haemadipsid, Idiobdella seychellensis Harding, 1913 shifted away
from feeding on blood on remote islands where terrestrial
gastropods are more plentiful (and often larger) than resident anurans [24].
To reflect the phylogeny, the family Hirudinidae sensu
stricto must hereafter exclude those bloodfeeding taxa
unrelated to H. medicinalis and minimally includes those
more closely related sanguivores [e.g., Hirudo, Goddardobdella, Hirudinaria, Aliolimnatis, Asiaticobdella included
here], but must also include the non-sanguivorous genera
Haemopis and Whitmania if leech taxonomy is to avoid
both polyphyly and paraphyly of this family. The remaining genera previously included in the family Hirudinidae
are in want of a unifying taxonomic name. Macrobdellidae [14] could include the genera Macrobdella, Philobdella,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/246

and Oxyptychus so as to reflexively retain a family for the
non-bloodfeeding Semiscolescidae (Sciban & Autrum,
1934), their sister taxon. Yet, this would leave the genera
Limnatis and Limnobdella without a synapomorphy for any
family that would be required to include them. Conveniently, the Hirudinidae sensu stricto are easily differentiated from the hirudinid clade typified by M. decora by
virtue of their profoundly muscular ejaculatory bulbs in
the median male reproductive apparatus that are efferent
to the epididymes; a characteristic Hirudinidae shares
with the Haemadipsidae. In the absence of a clear morphological synapomorphy for the Limnobdella/Limnatis
clade, we acknowedge that the genera Macrobdella, Philobdella, Oxyptychus, Limnobdella, Limnatis, and Semiscolex
could presently be considered genera in the family Semiscolescidae (sensu lato), in that this family has taxonomic
priority over the alternatives. Ironically, such a revision
would leave the characteristically bloodfeeding Hirudinidae encompassing some non-bloodfeeding taxa and the
traditionally non-bloodfeeding family Semiscolescidae
(sensu lato) including notable bloodfeeders.
The genus Patagoniobdella is, by virtue of its relationships,
merely a junior synonym of Semiscolex. Asiaticobdella fenestrata (Moore, 1939) falls within the genus Aliolimnatis. It
is likely that these two genera will have to be synonymized, though we are presently reluctant in the absence
of either of the type species for the genera. Similarly,
though W. laevis falls within the genus Hirudo, formal
revision should require the inclusion of the type species,
Whitmania pigra (Whitman, 1884).
Both H. nipponia and L. nilotica are known to include multiple morphological variants [25] (Oosthuizen notes in
the possession of MES) over a wide distribution (the latter
from Eastern Europe through the entire continent of
Africa and parts of India, and the former throughout
much of East Asia) and so most likely these each represent
multiple lineages. Notably, our determinations of the
identity of leeches matching the description of L. nilotica
represent a paraphyletic assemblage relative to L. paluda.
More sampling across the range of these taxa is needed in
order to better define lineages and distinguish potentially
cryptic species.
While there are no fossil data for correlation in historical
interpretations of the Hirudinidae, geologic events can be
used as a rough estimate when considering the current distributions of leech taxa. Assuming a vicariance-dominated
explanation, both clades would have had to originate on
Pangea with significant diversification in all groups prior
to the supercontinent's breakup. The Semiscolecidaerelated group seems to have originated in South America
with diversification into the clades containing Oxyptychus,
Semiscolex, and Patagoniobdella on that continent before

approximately three Mya when North and South America
became proximal. Thereafter, the lineage leading to Macrobdella and Philobdella could have dispersed north, a pattern mirrored in other leech groups, such as Helobdella and
Haementeria [26]. Some diversification would have had to
occur prior to the breakup of Pangea in order to explain
the presence of the genus Limnobdella in the New World
and the genus Limnatis in Old World locales. Long distance dispersal of some ancestral Limnatis or Limnobdella
species should be considered, though presently this is
only known for terrestrial leeches in the family Haemadipsidae feeding on birds.
The clade containing H. medicinalis also seems to have
undergone an intense period of diversification around the
time of the breakup of Pangea. The node joining the Aliolimnatis/Asiaticobdella, Hirudinaria, and Goddardobdella
clades is short and unstable suggesting a rapid diversification associated with the continental breakup of Pangea
during the Cretaceous. Closely related taxa from Africa,
Australia, and Southeast Asia follow a Gondwanan vicariance distribution, distinctly separate from the Laurasian
Haemopis/Hirudo sector of the Hirudinidae sensu stricto.
The sister group relationship of H. nipponia and W. laevis
reflects the geologic history of Asia with their northerly
origin in Laurasia and a later dispersal of the non-bloodfeeder into southern regions following a period of isolation from the remaining Hirudinidae by the presence of
the Turgai Sea (93 - 89 Mya) [27]. The unusual recent distribution of H. manillensis in the Caribbean closely related
to the others from (for example) Thailand can only be
explained by H. manillensis having been introduced to the
Caribbean in the 1800s by physicians using leeches on
board galleons transporting goods and persons between
Spanish holdings in the Pacific and the New World
[28,29]. Clarity regarding this potentially invasive species
might be better assessed through haplotype analyses
involving individuals from the Philippines and Northern
Taiwan, which were under Spanish influence when leech
phlebotomy was heavily practiced by European surgeons.
Despite extensive collection efforts, the type species of several genera in the family Hirudinidae have not been
included in this analysis. These include Aliolimnatis diversa
Richardson, 1972, Asiaticobdella birmanica (Blanchard,
1894), Semiscolex juvenilis Kinberg, 1866, and Whitmania
pigra (Whitman, 1884). As such, definitive segregation of
genera, and even their proper familial designations
remain underdetermined. Approximately 15 genera, an
inordinate numberof which are monotypic taxa from Australia described by Richardson [14], are not yet included
in phylogenetic analyses. We anticipate that the addition
of these and the multitudinous, however poorly distinguished, species described by Sciacchitano from Africa

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/246

[e.g., [30-32]], might yet provide better support for some
nodes, and further our understanding of the interrelationships of these medically important annelids.

Conclusion
The finding that the two groups of medicinal leeches have
independent evolutionary origins is not surprising
because the two clades do have subtle morphological and
behavioral differences. Hirudo species when swimming
form a complete sine wave with their bodies, while M. decora forms a sine wave and a half. Also, different anticoagulants are produced by each group [21]. This division,
now supported by molecular data, calls for an extensive
revision of all hirudinid-like taxa. Each taxon will have to
be carefully evaluated as some are not placing as would be
expected; a prime example being members of the genus
Limnatis. This brings a large majority of leech systematics
into question, and has far reaching implications. The distinctions are critical to researchers who use members of
the Hirudinidae in their work, such as neurobiologists
who use H. medicinalis as a model organism. These findings will have a greater impact upon those interested in
characterizing the anticoagulants isolated from the members of the two clades, making knowledge of the proper
evolutionary history of the group essential to giving context to future results.

Methods
Taxon selection
A total of 48 species composing 61 terminal taxa were
used in the analyses (Table 1). Taxa new to phylogenetic
analyses include: Motobdella montezuma Davies, 1985,
Limnobdella mexicana Blanchard, 1893 from several localities, Limnatis cf. nilotica, Limnatis paluda (Tennent, 1859),
Semiscolex intermedius Ringuelet, 1942, Semiscolex lamothei
Oceguera-Figueroa, 2005, Asiaticobdella fenestrata (Moore,
1939), and Goddardobdella elegans (Grube, 1867). Species
involved in previous analyses, but in this study with new
material, include: Aliolimnatis michaelseni (Augener,
1936), Haemopis sanguisuga (Linnaeus, 1758), Hirudinaria
javanica (Wahlberg, 1856), Hirudinaria manillensis (Lesson, 1842) from several localities, Hirudo troctina Johnson, 1816, and Whitmania laevis (Baird, 1869).

Three arhynchobdellid outgroup taxa were included in
the analyses: Americobdella valdiviana (Philippi, 1872) of
the family Americobdellidae, Cylicobdella coccinea Kennel,
1886 of the family Cylicobdellidae, and Motobdella montezuma of the family Erpobdellidae. An additional 17
hirudiniform taxa from the families Haemadipsidae and
Xerobdellidae were used for comparative purposes. The
three outgroup taxa were selected based on prior phylogenetic work [16]. Locality data and GenBank Accession
Numbers are listed in Table 1.

Specimens were identified using morphological characters. These included examination of arrangement of eyespots, number of annuli separating the gonopores,
number of gastic caecae, and the size and shape of internal
reproductive organs such as the penis, vagina, testisacs,
ovaries, and common oviduct if present. During this process, it was determined that a specimen used in earlier studies previously identified as L. nilotica (18S: AY425470,
28S: AY425389, 12S: AY425430, CO1: AY425452) collected in Israel used in Borda and Siddall [17] was actually
L. paluda. The morphological differences between the two
species was verified by the examination of the morphology of the L. paluda specimen from Afghanistan.
DNA extraction and purification
Specimens were stored at either -20°C or at ambient temperature in 95-100% ethanol. Tissue was collected from
the caudal sucker rather than from gastric or intestinal
regions to avoid contamination of the host/prey DNA. A
DNeasy Tissue Kit (Qiagen Valencia, CA) was used for tissue lysis and DNA purification.
DNA amplification
Primers used in Borda and Siddall [17] were used for the
PCR amplification of nuclear 18S rDNA (18S) and 28S
rDNA (28S) and mitochondrial 12S rDNA (12S) gene
fragments. PCR amplification of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene fragments was accomplished using the primers COI-A and COI-B [33] or
LCO1490 and HCO2198 [17]. All amplification reactions
of gene fragments were made using Ready-To-Go PCR
Beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ)
with 0.5 μl of each 10 μM primer, 1 μl DNA template, and
23 μl RNase-free H2O (total volume 25 μl) and were performed in an Eppendorf® Mastercycler®. The following
amplification protocols were used: for 18S, 94°C for 1
min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C (30 sec), 49°C (30
sec), 68°C (2 min 30 sec) and a final extension at 68°C
for 1 minute; for 28S and 12S, 94°C for 5 min, followed
by 39 cycles of 95°C (1 min), 52°C (1 min), 70°C (1
min) and a final extension of 72° for 7 minutes; for COI,
94°C for 1 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C (30 sec),
48°C (30 sec), 68°C (45 sec), 68°C (1 min) and a final
extension of 68°C for 1 min. PCR amplification products
were purified with AMPure™ (Agencourt Bioscience Corporation).
DNA sequencing and alignment
Cycle sequence reactions were performed with an Eppendorf® Mastercycler® using one of two different strategies: 7
μl Rnase-free H2O, 1 μl ABI Big Dye™ Terminator (v1.1 or
v3.1), 1 μl Big Dye™ Extender Buffer (v1.1 or v3.1), 1 μl of
1 μM primer and 3 μl of cleaned PCR template (13 μl total
volume) or 0.5 μl ABI Big Dye™ Terminator (v1.1 or v3.1),
0.5 μl Big Dye™ Extender Buffer (v1.1 or v3.1), 1 μl of 1

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/246

μM primer and 3 μl of cleaned PCR template (5 μl total
volume). Sequences were purified by 70% isopropanol/
70% ethanol precipitation and analyzed with an ABI
PRISM® 3730 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). CodonCode Aligner (CodonCode Corporation) was used to edit
and reconcile sequences. Alignments of all genes were
accomplished using the European Bioinformatics Institute server for MUSCLE applying default settings (MUltiple Sequence Comparison by Log-Expectation) v. 3.7 [34].
Phylogenetic analyses
Parsimony analyses of the genes (18S, 28S, COI, and 12S)
in combination were performed using PAUP* [4.02b]
[35]. Heuristic searches used 500 replicates of random
taxon addition and tree-bisection-reconnection branch
swapping. All characters were left unweighted and nonadditive. Gaps were treated as missing data. Parsimony
jackknife values for combined analyses were obtained
using random taxon addition and tree-bisection-reconnection branch swapping with 36% deletion and 100 heuristic pseudoreplicates [36].

Bayesian Inference was performed on the combined dataset using MrBayes v. 3.1.2 [37]. The data were partitioned
by gene for 18S, 28S, 12S, and by codon position for COI
(three partition; 3p). A GTR+Γ +I model was assumed for
each unlinked data partition based on the AIC (via ModelTest v. 3.7) [38,39]. For the Metropolis-Coupled Markov
Chain Monte Carlo (MCMCMC) analyses, default prior
distributions of parameters were used twice with one cold
chain and three hot chains for 10 million generations and
sampled every 1000th generation. The BI analyses burnedin before 2,600,000 generations. Split frequencies of the
standard deviation of simultaneous BI analyses were well
below 0.01. As such, the burn-in was set to discard the first
three million generations, leaving 7,000 trees sampled for
estimation of posterior probabilities (pp).
Maximum Likelihood analyses were performed on the
combined dataset using Treefinder [19] with the GTR+Γ
+I model applied for each unlinked data partition with
default settings.
Monophyly of the presumed monophyletic family
Hirudinidae was tested with the Templeton test [40] as
implemented in PAUP* [4.02b]. Bayes Factors were calculated using the equation 2 [ln(harmonic mean of constraint) - ln(harmonic mean of original analysis)] in
which strongly negative values (below -10) indicate rejection of the constrained analysis [41]. In addition, topological tests were conducted under the likelihood criterion
with Treefinder [19] in which independent (unlinked)
models were employed for the locus and codon partitions
defined as above. Constraints that were compared to the
optimal solution included 1) all traditional Hirudinidae

taxa as monophyletic but excluding the non-bloodfeeding
haemopids, and 2) all traditional Hirudinidae taxa and
traditional Haemopidae taxa as monophyletic but not
constraining either of these two subgroups to individually
be monophyletic.
