Bacterial community diversity and variation in
spray water sources and the tomato fruit surface

Abstract
Background: Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) consumption has been one of the most common causes of produceassociated salmonellosis in the United States. Contamination may originate from animal waste, insects, soil or
water. Current guidelines for fresh tomato production recommend the use of potable water for applications
coming in direct contact with the fruit, but due to high demand, water from other sources is frequently used. We
sought to describe the overall bacterial diversity on the surface of tomato fruit and the effect of two different
water sources (ground and surface water) when used for direct crop applications by generating a 454pyrosequencing 16S rRNA dataset of these different environments. This study represents the first in depth
characterization of bacterial communities in the tomato fruit surface and the water sources commonly used in
commercial vegetable production.
Results: The two water sources tested had a significantly different bacterial composition. Proteobacteria was
predominant in groundwater samples, whereas in the significantly more diverse surface water, abundant phyla also
included Firmicutes, Actinobacteria and Verrucomicrobia. The fruit surface bacterial communities on tomatoes
sprayed with both water sources could not be differentiated using various statistical methods. Both fruit surface
environments had a high representation of Gammaproteobacteria, and within this class the genera Pantoea and
Enterobacter were the most abundant.
Conclusions: Despite the major differences observed in the bacterial composition of ground and surface water,
the season long use of these very different water sources did not have a significant impact on the bacterial
composition of the tomato fruit surface. This study has provided the first next-generation sequencing database
describing the bacterial communities living in the fruit surface of a tomato crop under two different spray water
regimes, and therefore represents an important step forward towards the development of science-based metrics
for Good Agricultural Practices.

Background
An increasing number of epidemic outbreaks caused by
contamination of produce by human pathogens have
been observed in the United States [1]. Between 1996
and 2008, a total of 82 produce related outbreaks were
reported. Bacterial species comprise the majority of
reported disease causing agents, with pathogenic Salmonella and E. coli strains implicated most frequently. Lettuce and tomatoes were the commodities associated
with the most outbreaks, followed by cantaloupe and

berries [2]. In recent years, tomatoes have been one of
the main products responsible for produce-associated
salmonellosis [3].
The phyllosphere has found itself at an intersection of
food safety concerns and research that examines the
microbial ecology of agricultural environments [4-6].
Human pathogens find their way to this environment
via diverse channels that remain poorly understood.
Human, animal, atmospheric, abiotic and xenobiotic
conduits have all been examined for their potential to
contribute to the precise factors needed to support
growth or simple persistence of human pathogens of
bacterial origin in agricultural commodities [7,8]. An
extremely important component of agricultural management that remains to be comprehensively examined

with culture-independent methods is the microbial ecology associated with water sources used in irrigation and
pesticide applications.
In the United States, the tomato industry’s Good Agricultural Practices guidelines, which are focused on
improving the food safety of the product, recommend
the use of potable water for applications that come in
direct contact with the crop [9]. Given that large
volumes of water are needed for pesticide applications
and overhead irrigation of vegetable crops, water
demand cannot always be met with the available potable
water. Consequently growers routinely use water from
other sources, such as farm ponds. Surface water is
highly susceptible to contamination due to direct discharge of sewage and the impact of runoff. In the midAtlantic region of the United States growers report routine visits to their farm ponds by Canada geese, a potential avian reservoir of Salmonella [10] and white-tailed
deer, a potential reservoir for E. coli O157:H7 [11]. This
region is home to a large poultry industry, which also
represents a potential source of Salmonella contamination. Groundwater sources, on the other hand, are less
likely to support enteric pathogens because of the natural filtering mechanisms of soils, although poorly managed wells are susceptible to contamination [12].
The type of irrigation system can influence the risk of
crop contamination: overhead irrigation, for instance, is
more likely to produce virus contamination than are furrow and drip irrigation [13]. Studies conducted in California found no significant differences in coliform
counts among crops spray-irrigated with two types of
treated wastewater or with well water. This was found
despite the fact that the treated waters used in this
study showed higher levels of total and fecal coliforms
than the well water [14]. The overall impact of using
surface water for direct crop applications on fruit surface bacterial communities has not been reported to
date.
Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis studies have
indicated that variables such as plant species and stage
of development can affect the composition of phyllosphere microbial communities. In addition, it was found
that these communities are far more complex than culture-based methods used in the past had indicated
[6,15,16]. Recent studies described the bacterial diversity
of phyllosphere samples from natural and agricultural
ecosystems using traditional cloning and sequencing
approaches, leading to the identification of many previously undescribed members of these communities.
These studies also indicated that phyllosphere communities can be altered by the application of diverse agricultural materials [16-18].
More recently next-generation sequencing technologies, including 454-pyrosequencing, have provided more

comprehensive descriptions of bacterial communities in
different environments due to the increased number of
sequence reads obtained [19-26]. A study of bacterial
diversity on tree leaves using 454 sequencing indicated
that tree and bacterial community phylogeny are associated, and that the geographic differentiation of bacterial communities on a single tree species is minimal [27].
To our knowledge, no such studies have been conducted
to date to describe the impact of water quality on bacterial populations in the phyllosphere of specialty crops.
We utilized 454-pyrosequencing to generate 34,016
16S rRNA gene sequences from 16 field samples: 10
tomato fruit samples that had been sprayed with either
surface water (ps), or groundwater (pg), three samples of
surface water (ws), and three samples of groundwater
(wg). Using these data, we sought to 1) compare the
bacterial profile of ground and surface water that was
used for pesticide applications and 2) assess the impact
of water quality on the fruit surface bacterial profile of a
tomato crop. A smaller preliminary dataset of 2008 fruit
surface samples generated through Sanger sequencing is
also included for comparison. Despite the significant differences between bacterial communities in surface and
groundwater, the surface communities on the tomato
fruits treated with these water sources could not be differentiated by a variety of statistical methods.

Results
Taxonomic distributions among samples

After screening our data for poor sequences and contaminants (see Methods), we recovered 27,757 highquality 16S rRNA gene sequences with an average of
1,734 ± 471 (SD) sequences per sample (results refer to
the 2009 data unless otherwise stated).
We taxonomically classified all sequences (from phylum to genus) using the RDP Bayesian classifier with a
confidence threshold of 80%. Examining the phylum
level distributions across samples, we found that nearly
all fruit surface samples appeared to have very similar
16S rRNA profiles. In these, Proteobacteria dominated
the observed sequences, with smaller representations of
Firmicutes and Actinobacteria. One surface water treated sample (ps4) was dominated by Firmicutes
sequences, most likely as a result of contamination with
internal fruit material. While the wg samples displayed
similar 16S rRNA profiles dominated by Proteobacteria,
the ws samples had a more even representation among
four dominant phyla. In addition, ws samples contained
a large number of sequences that could not be classified
even at the phylum level (Figure 1).
To compare environments for differentially-abundant
taxonomic groups, we ran the Metastats methodology
[28] on phylum, class, and genus level assignments. However, a limitation of the Metastats approach for q-value

Figure 1 Phylum level abundance profiles using 16S rRNA sequence classifications. Columns reflect the percentage of 16S rRNA
sequences assigned to each phylum using the RDP classifier. All ws samples show a more even representation of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes,
Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia, as well as a higher representation of sequences that could not be assigned to any phylum (with a
confidence threshold of 80%). We also observe a spike in Firmicutes abundance in a surface water-treated phyllosphere sample 4 (ps4). In all
other samples, Proteobacteria 16S rRNA sequences tend to dominate the profiles.

(individual false discovery rate) estimation is poor accuracy for datasets with < 100 features. To compensate, we
compute the overall false discovery rate (FDR) for taxonomic groups we have called significant in our analysis
using the method by Benjamini and Hochberg [29].
Results of Metastats runs comparing bacterial classes
among populations and accounting for intra-replicate
variability indicated that five taxonomic classes are
differentially abundant in the two water sources (P <
0.015), most notably Betaproteobacteria, which makes
up approximately 86% of sequences on average in the
wg samples, but only close to 9% of sequences in the ws
samples (Additional file 1). Of the five taxonomic classes
we call as differentially abundant between wg and ws
samples, the FDR ~0.12, so we expect less than one
false positive among these five. The most abundant
classes in ws profiles were Alphaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria and the unclassified group.
Betaproteobacteria was also the most differentially
abundant class when pg and wg were compared (10 vs.
86%), among nine differentially abundant bacterial
classes (FDR ~0.07). Fourteen bacterial classes were differentially abundant between ws and ps (FDR ~0.06),
most notably Clostridia, which was enriched for in ws.

Both fruit surface environments were enriched for Gammaproteobacteria. Despite the differences observed
between water sources, no significant differences were
found between the two fruit surface environments (this
includes an attempt in which the ps4 outlier was
removed).
At the genus level, significant differences were found
between water sources, with 30 genera showing differential abundance (P < 0.05). Table 1 lists the bacterial genera among these representing 1% or more of the
sequences in either of the water sources analyzed. Fruit
surface environments were highly variable and no significant differences were detected for the high abundance
genera, which included Pantoea, Enterobacter, Sphingomonas, Leuconostoc, Pseudomonas and Burkholderia
(Additional file 2). The less abundant genera Paenibacillus, Stenotrophomonas, Bacillus and Lactococcus were
more abundant in pg, while Frigoribacterium, Herbaspirillum, Rickettsia, Wautersiella and Cloacibacterium were
more abundant in ps. None of these genera represented
more than 0.2% of the population.
A statistical comparison of the 2008 and 2009 fruit
surface samples (not considering variability between
2009 replicates) indicated that in both the 454 and

Gammaproteobacteria is enriched in pg (Figure 2A). At
the genus level, Pantoea showed high abundance in
both years (Figure 2B). Enterobacter, Pseudomonas,
Sphingomonas and Burkholderia were more predominant in the 2009 samples, while a larger proportion of
the 2008 sequences remained unclassified. These results
indicate that we were able to detect similar bacterial
populations on the tomato fruit surface in both years,
despite the methodological differences, the differences
between growing seasons and the fact that different
tomato cultivars were sampled.

Figure 2 Most abundant bacterial classes and genera in
tomato fruit surface samples (2008 and 2009). A) Bacterial
classes in surface and groundwater treated fruit surfaces, indicating
a predominance of Gammaproteobacteria in both years. B) Bacterial
genera in surface and groundwater treated fruit surfaces.

To compute estimates of species-level diversity and perform comparisons between environments, all sequences
were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
using Mothur [30] and a similarity threshold of 95%
(see Methods). The total number of unique OTUs
within each environment was 494 (pg), 399 (ps), 228
(wg) and 1342 (ws). After computing rarefaction curves
for each sample (Figure 3A), we immediately observed
that the surface water samples were significantly more
diverse than the others, and that groundwater and fruit
surface samples are indistinguishable in terms of diversity. Additionally, the Shannon diversity index and
Chao1 estimator were calculated for each sample, and
again we see that the ws samples are the most diverse at
the OTU level (Figure 3B).
To assess the diversity captured with the samples, we
calculated the Good’s Coverage Estimator on the OTUs
from each sample using Mothur. Results indicated that
we captured between 93 and 98% of the species in all of

Figure 3 OTU-based bacterial diversity analysis of water and crop samples. (A) Rarefaction curves displaying the average number of OTUs
discovered by random sampling within each sample. We observe a higher diversity in all surface water samples (ws) relative to fruit surface and
groundwater samples. (B) This increased diversity is also apparent through the Chao1 and Shannon diversity estimators. To avoid bias due to
different sampling depths, we first rarefied the data by randomly selecting 1100 sequences from each sample. Note that Chao1 estimates for
total species-level diversity in surface water samples consistently exceed 1000 species, while all other environments fall below 500.

the samples except for ws samples, where we only identified between 70 and 73% of the species.
We then examined shared OTUs between individual
replicates and treatments. Fruit surface environments
shared approximately half their OTUs, and these represented more than 90% of the sequences in both samples.
In contrast, water environments shared only 31 OTUs,
which represented 2% of the OTUs present in surface
water and 14% of those in groundwater. These shared
OTUs corresponded to 62% of the sequences in groundwater, but only 6% of the sequences in surface water.
These results again point to the greater differences
between water-based microbial communities as compared to those in the treated tomato fruit surfaces.
A hierarchical clustering of all samples was performed
using the Jaccard index based on shared OTU composition (Figure 4). This tree indicated that the two fruit
surface communities are not uniquely distinguishable at
the OTU level despite the microbial differences in water
sources. However, water samples did cluster with their
associated environments.
Alternative methodologies

To test the sensitivity of the above results to any particular methodology, we re-ran our analysis using the new
automated 16S rRNA pipelines provided by the CloVR
software package (http://clovr.org). CloVR is a virtual
machine designed to run large-scale genomic analyses in
a cloud-based environment such as Amazon EC2. The
CloVR-16S track runs Mothur [30] and Qiime-based
[31] standard operating protocols in parallel complete
with alpha and beta diversity analysis of multiple
samples.

After running our high-quality sequence dataset
through the CloVR-16S pipeline, we saw remarkable
consistency with our initial results. All OTU analyses
confirm the enriched diversity of surface water samples
as compared to all others, as well as a lack of differentially abundant taxonomic groups between pg and ps
samples.
Using various unsupervised approaches, water samples
consistently clustered with their unique environments at
all taxonomic levels (Figure 5). There was persistent difficulty distinguishing between fruit surface samples treated with surface or groundwater. Even the UniFrac
metric, which arguably maintains the highest phylogenetic resolution of any method, was unable to resolve
this issue (Figure 6). The concordance among our methodology and the CloVR-16S methods suggests that our
results are not sensitive to modifications in the analysis
protocol.
Screening for Enterobacteriaceae pathogens

Less than 1% of the hits in the water samples were to
the family Enterobacteriaceae (Table 2). In fruit surface
samples 33 to 79% of the sequences were identified as
Enterobacteriaceae, with higher counts in pg than in ps
in 2008 and again in 2009. Among the Enterobacteriaceae genera, Pantoea was the most abundant in both
years. Enterobacter also showed high abundance, but
only in the 2009 samples.
We created a phylogenetic tree in order to compare
the Enterobacteriaceae species present in the different
samples (Figure 7). By populating the tree with several
genera we could not confidently assign sequences to
pathogenic species within the family. Based on our tree,

index. Using shared OTU profiles across all samples, we computed
Jaccard indices for clustering samples based on overall community
similarity. Samples from each water environment cluster well, but
even using OTU resolution, the fruit surface samples were not easily
distinguishable.

the 527 bp segment of the 16S rRNA gene used is not
enough to distinguish between several members of the
Enterobacteriaceae family.

Discussion
This study provides the first next-generation sequencing
survey of the bacterial community in the tomato fruit
surface. As such it has confirmed the presence of taxa
previously found to inhabit the phyllosphere of this crop
species, as well as identified many others not yet
encountered in this environment. The three most abundant bacterial classes in the tomato fruit surface environments compared in this study were Gamma, Alpha
and Betaproteobacteria. These were also found in higher
abundance in the phyllosphere of other plant species,
although the relative abundances for these classes vary
[16-18,27]. Genera here found in high abundance in the
tomato fruit surface, such as Pantoea and Enterobacter,
are also abundant in the phyllosphere of certain Atlantic
rainforest tree species and cottonwood, indicating a
wide distribution across different plant species [16,18].
Bacterial genera found in our 2009 fruit surface samples

Page 6 of 13

were also identified among the culturable bacteria on
leaves of field-grown tomatoes, including Pseudomonas,
Pantoea, Sphingomonas, Massilia, Xhantomonas and
Curtobacterium [32]. Two additional genera, Burkholderia and Leuconostoc, showed high abundance in our
study. Burkholderia was the most abundant genus in
our groundwater samples, representing 75% of the
sequences, and might have been introduced in the environment through groundwater applications. Leuconostoc
has been previously described as the predominant lactic
acid bacteria on tomato fruit surfaces [33].
Similar bacterial classes and genera were found in
high abundance in samples collected in 2008 and 2009,
with the largest differences corresponding to the unclassified sequences. Several different reasons could account
for this variation, including differences in DNA extraction, sequencing sample preparation and primers used
in both years, as well as potential growing season effects.
Of special interest is the high proportion of sequences
identified as Enterobacteriaceae, given that this family
includes important human pathogenic bacteria like Salmonella and E. coli. Similar representation of this family
was obtained in the phyllosphere of Trichilia spp. and
Pinus ponderosa, but not in that of Campomanesia
xanthocarpa [16,27]. The high adaptability of this family
to the tomato fruit surface environment might be associated to the higher risk of disease outbreaks associated
with this crop.
Differences between fruit surface environments do not
appear to be linked to the water applications, indicating
that plant conditions allow for only some of the bacterial groups present in water to establish themselves. Similar results were obtained when the fruit surface
communities living on apple trees under conventional
and organic management were compared, where only
low abundance groups differed between the two environments [17]. Similarly, no effect on the levels of fecal
and total coliforms was observed when reclaimed water
with higher coliform counts, and well water were
sprayed on six horticultural crops [14].
Several factors determine whether the microorganisms
arriving on the leaf surface can become established,
including leaf characteristics, environmental factors and
properties of the microorganisms themselves [8]. Pesticides are known to differentially impact bacterial survival and growth. In a study conducted to determine the
effect of pesticides on bacterial survival, Salmonella spp.
were best able to survive and Listeria spp. were least
able to survive in pesticide solutions, among all the bacteria tested. Bravo, the fungicide applied closest to the
sampling date in this study, has been found to reduce
bacterial growth, although it was less inhibitory than
other products tested [34]. The addition of pesticides to
the different water sources used in this study might

have reduced bacterial community differentiation in the
two resulting fruit environments. The smooth texture of
tomato skin may also prevent attachment and result in
bacteria being washed away by rain or spray water.
Although our results point to the lack of major effects
of the two water sources used for pesticide applications,
confirming this at the species level for human enteric
pathogens such as Salmonella, would be crucial for
establishing the potential safety of surface water use for
contact applications. In addition, our sampling depth
analysis suggests that deeper sampling is needed for all
the environments, but especially for the more diverse
ws, to capture at least 90% of the community members
Recent studies of analysis methodologies in bacterial
diversity and metagenomics projects have revealed that

small modifications or substitution of similar tools may
potentially result in significant changes in the overall
biological conclusions [35-37]. In the rapidly evolving
field of genomics, there are few concrete standards, and
the sophisticated computational protocols being developed certainly will always be sensitive to some uncertainty in the analysis parameters. To examine the
sensitivity of our results to the methodology employed,
we re-ran our analysis using two parallel 16S rRNA protocols from the CloVR package and found large agreement with our major results. Additionally, the 454
platform itself has ongoing issues regarding artificial
replicate generation [38] and homopolymer identification errors [39], both of which contribute to overestimation of species-level diversity in 16S rRNA-based

species-level diversity are indeed inflated, the consistency in relative diversity differences between samples
across multiple analyses is encouraging and lends support to the validity of our initial computational results
and final biological and ecological conclusions.

Conclusions
Our research has generated the first culture-independent next-generation sequencing data set for the

bacterial microbiology associated with the phyllosphere
of a tomato crop under agricultural management. There
are a myriad of agricultural practices that may play a
role in the contamination of tomatoes by human pathogenic bacteria. This work has provided valuable evidence
suggesting that water used for pesticide applications
does not represent a major modifier of the fruit surface
bacterial communities composition.
As previously reported for other plant species,
Gamma, Alpha and Betaproteobacteria and Bacilli comprised most of the 16S rRNA sequences identified in the
tomato fruit surface, while the most abundant genera
included Pantoea, Enterobacter, Leuconostoc, Pseudomonas, Weissella, Sphingomonas and Burkolderia. We suggest that the high representation of Enterobacteriaceae
in the tomato fruit surface might be associated with the
elevated food safety risks posed by this crop.
These results represent a major contribution to the
understanding of the tomato fruit surface ecology and
an important step towards the establishment of sciencebased metrics for Good Agricultural Practices that will
ensure the safety of horticultural products. The emerging role of tomato as a model organism further emphasizes the value of a deeper understanding of the
interactions between this crop species, its associated
microflora and the environment.

Figure 7 Neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree of reads mapping to members of the Enterobacteriaceae family. Screening our dataset for
putative E. coli/Shigella/Salmonella species we discovered most hits were from the fruit surface samples. We found that by including 16S rRNA
reference sequences from members of other related genera including Citrobacter and Cronobacter, we could not confidently assign any
sequences from our dataset to Salmonella due to poor phylogenetic resolution. However, we did determine that no reads mapping to the
Enterobacteriaceae family were from E. coli/Shigella. The E. coli/Shigella monophyletic clade is colored in red, the Staphylococcus aureus outgroup
is purple, and monophyletic clades of sequences from our dataset are colored in green.

(2008) and ‘Juliet’ (2009) grape tomato plants were
planted on black plastic mulch and trained using stakes
and a four-tier string system. The experimental design
was a randomized complete block design with five
blocks and three treatments. Seedlings were planted in
paired rows (only one of them used for this study), 1.8
m apart. Each paired row was 9.0 m apart from the next
set of paired rows. Within each row, each experimental
unit was 9.0 m from the next. An experimental plot was
composed of 3 grape tomato plants alternated with 2

‘Brandywine’ shipping tomato plants, which were not
used for sampling (2008) or 5 grape tomato plants
(2009) at an in-row spacing of 60 cm. In 2008, pesticides mixed in either ground or surface water were
sprayed on: June 21, June 29, July 7, July 15, July 23,
July 30, August 10 and August 30. In 2009, pesticides
were sprayed on July 2, July 14, July 28, August 9,
August 20 and August 30. Spray treatments were
applied with a CO2-pressurized boom sprayer, using a
separate sprayer manifold consisting of nozzles, hoses

Telias et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:81
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/81

and a tank for each treatment. These booms were used
throughout the season. Additional treatments (not used
for this study) included organic managed plots (2008)
and use of an additional pond as a source of surface
water (2009). Standard agricultural practices for the production of shipping tomatoes in the region were used.
Sample collection and processing

Samples consisting of 6 tomato fruits were aseptically
collected on September 1 2008 and August 31 2009.
Fruits were systematically harvested from different
locations within the experimental unit and placed in
Ziploc ® bags (2008) or Whirl-Pak ® bags (2009) by
using new gloves for each replicate and ethanol disinfection of pruning shears between samples. Samples
were then transported back to the laboratory at 4°C.
One hundred milliliters of sterile water were added to
the bags, and samples were agitated for 1 minute by
hand and then sonicated for 2 minutes. The microfloral wash was then transferred to polypropylene
tubes and centrifuged at 30,000 × g overnight at 4°C.
The pellet was then transferred to a microcentrifuge
tube and stored at -80°C until DNA extraction was
performed. Three liters of groundwater and 50 ml of
surface water collected on August 31 2009 were filtered through 0.45 μm Fisherbrand ® filters (Fisher
Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). Filters were aseptically
divided into four microcentrifuge tubes and stored at
80°C. DNA extraction from filters and pellets was performed using the Promega Wizard DNA extraction kit
(Promega, Madison, WI) in 2008, and the Zymo
Research fungal/bacterial DNA extraction kit (Zymo
Research, Orange, CA) in 2009.
Cloning and Sanger sequencing (2008)

PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene was
performed using forward primer GM5F 5’-CCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3’ [40] and reverse primer 907R 5’CCCCGTCAATTCCTTTGAGTTT-3’ [41], designed to
amplify a 588 base pair long region including the variable region V3. PCR reactions were performed using
TaKaRa premix (TaKaRa Shuzo Co., Shiga, Japan) in a
50 μl total volume (1 μl genomic DNA as template, 1 μl
each primer, 22 μl sterile water and 25 μl TaKaRa premix). PCRs used a denaturation step at 98°C for 5 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 minute, 55°C
for 1 minute, 72°C for 1 minute, with a final extension
step at 72°C for 5 minutes. PCR fragments were cloned
into the pGEM®-T Easy Vector (Promega) according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Bacterial colonies were frozen in 100 μl aliquots of Luria broth (Miller) solution
with 10% glycerol in 96-well plates and shipped on dry
ice to Agencourt Genomic Services, Beverly, MA, for
Sanger sequencing.

454 sequencing (2009)

PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene was
performed using forward primer Bact-8F (AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) [42] and reverse primer UNI518R
(ATTACCGCGGCTGCTGG) [16], designed to amplify
a 527 base pair long region including variable regions
V1, V2 and V3. The forward primer included the fusion
primer A (CGTATCGCCTCCCTCGCGCCATCAG) in
its 5’ end. The reverse primer included the fusion primer B (CTATGCGCCTTGCCAGCCCGCTCAG) in its
5’ end, followed by sample specific 10 bp barcodes.
Standard PCRs were performed using AmpliTaq Gold
LD™ (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a 50 μl
total volume (1 μl genomic DNA as template, 1 μM
each primer, 200 μM each dNTP, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0.60
units AmpliTaq Gold LD, 10 × buffer provided by manufacturer). PCRs used a denaturation step at 95°C for 5
min, followed by 30 cycles of 95°C 1 min, 55°C 1 min,
72°C 1 min, with a final extension step at 72°C for 5
min. Four independent PCR amplifications were performed for each sample. After a gel based confirmation
of PCR amplification, PCR products were purified using
the AMPure kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) following
manufacturer’s recommendations, and quantified using
a Qubit flurometer (Invitrogen). PCR products were
pooled and the average fragment size was assessed on a
2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) using a
DNA 7500 chip. Emulsion-based clonal amplification
and sequencing on the 454 Genome Sequencer FLXTitanium system were performed at the W. M. Keck
Center for Comparative and Functional Genomics at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign according to
the manufacturer’s instructions (454 Life Sciences, Branford, CT). The PCR products were sequenced on two
regions of a 16-region 70 × 75 picotiter plate. Signal
processing and base calling were performed using the
bundled 454 Data Analysis Software version 2.0.00.
Initial sequence preprocessing

Recent validation studies have demonstrated several
biases in analyses of 16S rRNA sequence datasets produced using 454-pyrosequencing technology [43]. We
have deposited the 454 raw data in NCBI-SRA under
the accession number SRX040888. To mitigate these
issues for this study, 454 sequences were processed and
analyzed using the following state-of-the-art procedures.
Sequences were first selected for length and quality
according to the following criteria:
(i) ≥100 nucleotides in length (not including samplespecific barcodes)
(ii) a perfect match to a sample-specific barcode
(iii) reads were trimmed at the beginning of a poor
quality region - defined as a 10 bp window containing 8
bp with a Phred-score ≤ 20.

Telias et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:81
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/11/81

Reads meeting the above criteria underwent rigorous
screening for chimeric reads (using ChimeraSlayer
(http://microbiomeutil.sourceforge.net/- Broad Institute)
and contaminants such as chloroplast and eukaryotic
DNA using BLAST [44]. The remaining set of highquality 16S rRNA sequences were assigned to specific
samples using multiplex barcodes incorporated during
PCR amplification.
Taxonomic assignment and OTU analysis

Each read was assigned a putative taxonomic identity
using the RDP Bayesian classifier [45] (minimum confidence of 80%) as well as a secondary assignment using
BLAST against the Greengenes database by using an E
value cutoff of 1e-10 and the Hugenholtz taxonomy
[46]. To describe the species-level structure of each
microbial community, all sequences were clustered into
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using modules
from the software package Mothur created by Pat
Schloss [30]. Specifically, unique reads were aligned to
the core Greengenes 16S template alignment using
NAST [46]. Evolutionary distances were computed
between all pairs of aligned sequences, which served as
input to a furthest-neighbor clustering algorithm utilizing a distance threshold of 0.05 (i.e. 95% similarity).
Good’s coverage estimator [47] was computed for each
sample using Mothur, which uses the following formula:
Ci = 1 −

length. NAST was then used to create a multiple
sequence alignment of all matching reads and a reference set of 68 Enterobacteriaceae species that spanned
Salmonella, E. coli, Klebsiella, Pantoea, Enterobacter,
Cronobacter, and Citrobacter. The resulting MSA was
trimmed by removing columns in the alignment with a
high percentage of gaps (> 20%). The trimmed MSA
was imported into Arb to create a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree, using Staphylococcus aureus as an
outgroup.
Comparing alternative methodologies

To investigate the sensitivity of our major results to our
particular methodology, we ran two alternate analyses
employed by the CloVR virtual machine software package (http://clovr.org - Institute for Genome Sciences University of Maryland Baltimore). These methodologies
run similar analyses using Mothur [30] and Qiime [31]
on a distributed cloud-computing architecture such as
Amazon EC2. The high-quality dataset created after
screening for contaminant and chimeras was used as
input to the CloVR-16S pipeline.

where Good’s coverage of the ith sample (Ci) depends
on the total number of sequences in the sample (N i )
and the number of singleton OTUs within that sample,

Statistical comparisons between environments were
made using Metastats [28] (with 1000 permutations) to
detect differentially abundant taxonomic groups at the
phylum, class, genus, and OTU levels. Unless explicitly
stated in the text, we employed a p-value significance
threshold of 0.05.
Enterobacteriaceae analysis

To perform a species-level analysis of the Enterobacteriaceae family, we created a database of 8,088 annotated
16S rRNA gene sequences from several Enterobacteriaceae species using the RDP database [48]. This database
includes 451 16S rRNA sequences from Salmonella species, 951 from E. coli or Shigella, 762 from Enterobacter,
725 from Pantoea, and various other associated genera
and environmental candidates.
We then searched all sequences from our samples
against this database using BLASTN with default parameters and isolated any reads matching one of the reference genes with ≥ 98% identity along ≥ 95% of its
