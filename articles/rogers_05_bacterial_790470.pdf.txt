Cystic Fibrosisbacterial infections16S rDNAT-RFLP profilingbacterial activity

Abstract
Background: Chronic lung infections are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality in Cystic
Fibrosis (CF) patients. Recent molecular biological based studies have identified a surprisingly wide
range of hitherto unreported bacterial species in the lungs of CF patients. The aim of this study was
to determine whether the species present were active and, as such, worthy of further investigation
as potential pathogens.
Methods: Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles were generated
from PCR products amplified from 16S rDNA and Reverse Transcription Terminal Restriction
Fragment Length Polymorphism (RT-T-RFLP) profiles, a marker of metabolic activity, were
generated from PCR products amplified from 16S rRNA, both extracted from the same CF sputum
sample. To test the level of activity of these bacteria, T-RFLP profiles were compared to RT-T-RFLP
profiles.
Results: Samples from 17 individuals were studied. Parallel analyses identified a total of 706
individual T-RF and RT-T-RF bands in this sample set. 323 bands were detected by T-RFLP and 383
bands were detected by RT-T-RFLP (statistically significant; P ≤ 0.001). For the group as a whole,
145 bands were detected in a T-RFLP profile alone, suggesting metabolically inactive bacteria. 205
bands were detected in an RT-T-RFLP profile alone and 178 bands were detected in both,
suggesting a significant degree of metabolic activity. Although Pseudomonas aeruginosa was present
and active in many patients, a low occurrence of other species traditionally considered to be key
CF pathogens was detected. T-RFLP profiles obtained for induced sputum samples provided by
healthy individuals without CF formed a separate cluster indicating a low level of similarity to those
from CF patients.
Conclusion: These results indicate that a high proportion of the bacterial species detected in the
sputum from all of the CF patients in the study are active. The widespread activity of bacterial
species in these samples emphasizes the potential importance of these previously unrecognized
species within the CF lung.

Introduction
The Microbiological analysis of clinical specimens has
relied traditionally on cultivation prior to identification.
However, recent genetic innovations promise to provide
dramatic advances in diagnosis and fresh insights into
infections that have previously been considered well characterised. The use of molecular biological approaches in
clinical scenarios obviates the requirement for in vitro culture prior to analysis and so removes problems associated
with microbial cultivation. In addition, these approaches
are ideal for cases such as trauma where predicting the
pathogen(s) responsible is challenging.
Molecular biological approaches have gained widespread
acceptance for the study of bacterial communities in natural environments [reviewed in [1-3]]. Here, nucleic acids,
extracted directly from samples, act as templates for PCR
amplification of phylogenetically-informative ribosomal
sequences using oligonucleotide primers "universal" for
the Domain Bacteria. This means that no prior assumptions are made about the identity of species present. Bacterial community composition can then be assessed
through sequence analysis of cloned ribosomal PCR products and by Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiling [4,5].
Here, we focus on bacterial infections within the lungs of
cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. There are more than 5,000
registered CF patients in the UK [6]. Although CF patient
life expectancy has steadily increased, the mortality rate
for patients aged between 26 and 30 years remains at
around 50 per 1000 per year [7]. Mortality is primarily
determined by repeated infective exacerbations. Ultimately, 80 to 95% of CF patients succumb to respiratory
failure brought on by chronic bacterial infection and concomitant airway inflammation [8]. The characterisation of
the bacteria present in the CF lung is critical if therapy is
to be advanced. Moreover, we suggest that this strategy
can benefit a diverse range of clinical scenarios.

tions [15]. In addition, many of the species identified,
including Abiotrophia adiacens, Mycoplasma salivarium, Ralstonia taiwanensis, Rothia mucilaginosus and Staphylococcus
hominis, had not been reported as previously isolated from
CF sputum. Although the role of these species in lung
pathogenesis has yet to be determined, the first step is to
establish whether they are active within the CF lung.
Although activity does not necessarily imply pathogenicity, it strongly suggests that further study is warranted.
Here, we assess the extent to which bacteria in sputum
sampled from the CF lung were active by exploiting the
difference in stability of DNA and RNA. As 16S rRNA is
inherently unstable, it can be used to define intact, metabolically active bacterial cells [16] with bacterial metabolic activity inferred from the level of transcription of
these sequences [17]. Reverse Transcription Terminal
Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RT-T-RFLP),
performed in parallel with T-RFLP provides an accepted
means of determining relative metabolic activity within
communities [18]. T-RFLP and RT-T-RFLP analyse the
same genetic sequence. The single difference is that in RTT-RFLP, complementary DNA (cDNA) copies, generated
from 16S rRNA, are used as the template instead of 16S
rDNA. Here, we wished to test the hypothesis that the
majority of the species identified in the CF lung are active.
To do this, two profiling approaches were used to study
DNA and RNA extracted directly from the same clinical
sample taken from 17 CF patients. Further, the T-RFLP
profiles generated from the 17 CF sputa were compared to
those generated from sputa obtained from 19 healthy,
non-CF individuals.

Materials and methods

Previous molecular biological studies have shown that the
level of bacterial diversity in adult CF sputum was much
higher than previously recognised [9-12] and that the
communities detected were distinct. This contrasts
sharply with wisdom informed by traditional screening of
sputa that focuses on only a few pathogenic species
including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus
and the Burkholderia cepacia complex.

Clinical samples and preparation for nucleic acid
extraction
Sputum samples were collected from 17 adult CF patients
attending Southampton University Hospital, with ethical
approval granted by the Southampton Research Ethics
Committee (067/01). 12 patients were suffering infective
exacerbation at time of sampling, whilst five were considered to be stable. Ten volumes of RNAlater solution
(Promega, Southampton, UK) were added to sputum
samples immediately following collection following
manufacturer's instructions. Prior to nucleic acid extraction, samples were prepared for nucleic acid extraction,
using a series of washes and sputasol treatment as
described previously [10].

Moreover, many of the species detected were anaerobes –
often obligate – from within the genera Bacteroides, Eubacterium, Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Rothia and
Veillonella. This agreed with earlier studies [13,14] and
may be of particular relevance given the increased recognition of the importance of anaerobic growth in CF infec-

DNA and RNA extraction
All reagents, glassware and plastics used in RNA work
were DEPC-treated prior to use. RNA was extracted as follows: 0.75 ml of Tri Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK)
were added to approximately 0.2 ml of each sample and
vortexed for 1 min. Samples were incubated at room

temperature for 5 min prior to the addition of 0.2 ml chloroform. Samples were vortexed for 15 sec. and incubated
at room temperature for 5 min. Phases were separated by
centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C.
i) DNA extraction
0.3 ml of 100% ethanol was added to precipitate the DNA
from the lower phase. The sample was mixed by inversion, incubated at room temperature for 3 min and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4°C. The pellet was
washed in 0.1 M sodium citrate, 10% ethanol solution
(during each wash the pellet was allowed to stand for at
least 30 min). Pellets were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5
min at 4°C and washed twice in 75% ethanol. The DNA
was vacuum dried, with the pellet resuspended in 100 µl
H2O and stored at -20°C.
ii) RNA extraction
The upper phase was transferred to a fresh microfuge tube
and 0.5 ml of propan-2-ol were added. Samples were
incubated for 10 min at room temperature and RNA was
pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C.
The supernatant was removed and the RNA pellet washed
once in 75% ethanol and re-pelleted by centrifugation at
7,500 × g for 5 min at 4°C. Pellets were air-dried for 10
min, resuspended in 30 µl distilled water and incubated
for 10 mins at 55°C. Purified RNA samples were stored as
aliquots at -70°C.

Prior to reverse transcription, any residual DNA was
removed using DNAseI (Epicentre, Madison, USA) in
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, with
PCR amplification controls performed as appropriate.
Reverse transcription
Two universal bacterial primers were used, namely; 8f700
(5'-AGA GTT TGA TCC TGG CTC AG-3') and 920r (5'CCG TCA ATT CAT TTG AGT TT-3') [5,10]. cDNA was generated from the isolated RNA using 920r and AMV reverse
transcriptase (Promega, Southampton, UK) in accordance
with the manufacturer's instructions. Double stranded
DNA was generated using 1 µl of this cDNA as template in
a 50 µl PCR reaction containing both primers (8f700 and
920r). PCR products amplified were verified by Tris-acetate-EDTA (TAE)-agarose gel electrophoresis on 0.8% (wt/
vol) TAE-agarose gels stained in ethidium bromide (0.5
mg/L) with images, viewed on a UV transilluminator
(Herolab, Wiesloch, Germany), captured by using a Herolab image analyzer with E.A.S.Y STOP win 32 software
(Herolab).
DNA quantification
Extracted DNA and restricted PCR products (below) were
quantified using a CytoFluor series 4000 multiwell plate
reader (PerSeptive Biosystems, Foster City, USA) using the

http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/49

PicoGreen DS DNA quantitation kit (Molecular Probes,
Lieden, Netherlands) following the manufacturer's
instructions.
T-RFLP amplification and profiling
PCR products for T-RFLP analysis were amplified using
primers 8f700 (labelled at the 5'end with IRD700) and
926r from c. 20 ng of extracted DNA as previously
described [10]. PCR products (c. 20 ng) were digested to
completion using 1 U of the restriction endonuclease CfoI,
with c. 0.7 µg of T-RFLP PCR products were separated by
length using a LI-COR IR2 automated DNA sequencer
again as previously described [10]. The gels were analysed
by using GeneimageIR v.3.56 (Scanalytics, Fairfax, USA).
When profile data were assessed, only peaks of ≥ 0.1% of
the total lane signal were classified as bands for further
analysis. The positions of these individual bands were calculated in relation to microSTEP 15 a (700-nm) size
marker (Microzone, Lewes, UK). A threshold of ×2 was
used as a means of identifying marked differences
between T-RFLP and RT-T-RFLP band volumes.
Band Quantification and calling
The IR signal level produced by each band was determined using Phoretix 1D Advanced v.5.10, (Nonlinear
Dynamics, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK). Due to the low volumes loaded, small errors could have lead to significant
variations in band intensity. To avoid such errors, band
volumes were determined as a percentage of the total
band volume detected in each profile.
Sputum from non-CF individuals
Sputum production was induced in 19 healthy, non-CF
individuals by the inhalation of nebulised saline for 5
min. Following nebulisation, subjects were asked to rinse
their mouths thoroughly with water and blow their noses.
Expectorated sputum was then collected and subjected to
the same DNA extraction, amplification and profiling protocols employed for CF sputum analysis. Individuals were
selected at random to provide sputum samples. Individuals that reported either acute or chronic respiratory problems were excluded.
in silico sequence analysis
Published bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence data, stored
at
GenBank
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/
query.fcgi?db_Nucleotide, were retrieved. MapSort (Wisconsin Package version 10.3; Accelrys) was used to predict
the band sizes for T-RFLP analysis. Mapsort, which locates
the position of restriction endonuclease recognition
motifs in a given sequence, was used to determine the
length (in bases) from the 5' end of primer 8f-700IR (see
below) to the first cleavage position of the restriction
endonuclease CfoI in each 16S rRNA gene sequence. This
process was performed on all of the bacterial entries in the

Respiratory Research 2005, 6:49

Genbank database that spanned the amplified region. In
this way, it was possible to predict the length of T-RF
bands generated from 853 separate phylotypes (data not
shown).
Statistical analysis
For each of the bands that were detected in a T-RFLP or RTT-RFLP profile unaccompanied by a band in the corresponding RT-T-RFLP or T-RFLP profile, the frequency of
unaccompanied detection was compared with the frequency of accompanied detection in the sample set as a
whole. The ratio of unaccompanied detection to total
detection was multiplied by unaccompanied detection.
This was performed because relatively frequently detected
bands, which were unaccompanied in a majority of
instances, would otherwise appear less significant. A score
≥ 2 was used as a threshold for the identification of bands
that differed notably between their detection by the two
techniques.

Hierarchical cluster analysis, with the Dice measure and
Chi-square test using Yates correction (SPSS for Windows
v.10.1, SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA) was used to construct a
dendrogram representing level of similarity between the
34 bacterial community T-RFLP and RT-T-RFLP profiles
studied here. Further, this process was used to compare
the similarity of T-RFLP profiles generated from CF sputa
with those generated from healthy, non-CF sputum.
Role of the funding source
The sources of funding of this study were not involved in
experimental design and interpretation. No influence was
exerted on the decision to publish.

Results
Electrophoretic gel images generated by T-RFLP and RT-TRFLP profiling from five sputum samples are shown in
Figure 1. An example of the identification of individual
bands within a region of electrophoretic profile is shown
for corresponding areas of a T-RFLP and RT-T-RFLP profiles in Figure 2.
T-RFLP and RT-T-RFLP profiling
Parallel T-RFLP and RT-T-RFLP analysis was performed on
17 sputum samples. A total of 706 individual T-RF and
RT-T-RF bands were detected in this sample set. Of these,
323 were detected by T-RFLP analysis and 383 were
detected by RT-T-RFLP analysis. This difference in the
number of bands detected was significant (P ≤ 0.001, Chisquare test, Yates correction). The number of bands
detected in profiles generated from each individual sample is shown in Table 1.

The banding positions generated through T-RFLP and RTT-RFLP analysis were compared for each sample. 178

http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/49

bands were detected in both a T-RFLP profile and the corresponding RT-T-RFLP profile (356 bands in total), 145
bands were detected in a T-RFLP profile but were absent in
the corresponding RT-T-RFLP profile, and 205 bands were
detected in an RT-T-RFLP profile but were absent in the
corresponding T-RFLP profile.
Where a band of a given length was detected in profiles
generated in a sample, it was present in both T-RFLP and
RT-T-RFLP profiles in 33.7% of instances. In 27.4% of
instances in was detected in the T-RFLP profile alone and
in 38.8% of instances it was detected in the RT-T-RFLP
profile alone.
The ratio of unaccompanied bands to total bands detected
was multiplied by the number of unaccompanied bands
detected. This process identified 7 band lengths with a
score of ≥ 2 in T-RFLP profiles, compared with 25 band
lengths in RT-T-RFLP profiles. The only band from either
group whose length corresponded to that of a recognised
CF pathogen was 209 bases (B. cepacia complex) had a
score of 2.0 in RT-T-RFLP profiles. No pattern was discerned between any of the other bacterial species whose
predicted T-RF length corresponded with these bands. No
band length had a score ≥ 2 in both T-RFLP and RT-T-RFLP
profiles.
The intensity of each of the T-RF bands detected was determined and placed in rank order (descending band volume) (Table 2, see additional file). The five highest rank
ordered bands represented 39.5% (± 21.1), 14.4% (± 6.2),
8.6% (± 2.6), 5.8% (± 1.6), and 4.5% (± 2.0) of the total
band signal in T-RFLP profiles respectively. For RT-T-RFLP
profiles, the top five rank ordered T-RF bands represented
35.2% (± 19.4), 14.4% (± 6.9), 9.2% (± 3.3), 7.0% (± 2.9)
and 4.7% (± 1.7), respectively.
Fifty five of the T-RF bands lengths detected by T-RFLP
profiling were in the five most intense bands in one or
more profile, compared with 53 T-RF band lengths in RTT-RFLP profiling. T-RF bands of a given length were
detected within the top five rank ordered positions of
intensity in an average of 1.5 T-RFLP profiles and 1.6 RTT-RFLP profiles. Of the T-RF band lengths identified in
this way, 26 were detected in the top five rank positions in
T-RFLP profiles but not RT-T-RFLP profiles, whereas 25
were detected in the top five rank positions in RT-T-RFLP
profiles but not in T-RFLP profiles.
In both cases, a T-RF band of 155 bases, corresponding to
that produced by P. aeruginosa, was the most frequently
detected band in the top five rank ordered positions,
being detected in 8.2% and 9.4 % of T-RFLP and RT-TRFLP profiles respectively. The second most commonly
detected T-RF band length was also the same in both

sputum samples within the sample set. By a process of automated comparison of band positions with those in marker lanes
allows their length to be determined and direct comparisons to be made between lanes.

profiling approaches – a T-RF band of 78 bases in length
was detected in one of top five rank ordered positions in
5.9% and 4.7% of T-RFLP and RT-T-RFLP profiles respectively. Computer-based band length predictions made
using published sequence data indicate that a 78 base TRF band would be consistent with that produced by
Ectothiorhodospira mobilis, Methylobacter psychrophilus,
Methylomicrobium agile, Methylomonas rfodinarum and
Methylomonas rubra.
The prevalence of other bacterial species that have been
considered traditionally to be key CF pathogens was determined. In general, it was found that these were not highly
represented in either the T-RFLP or RT-T-RFLP profiles. A

band corresponding to B. cepacia complex was detected in
one T-RFLP profile (patient 7), and one RT-T-RFLP profile
(patient 2). These bands represented 2.2% and 3.3% of
total band volume respectively. A band corresponding to
H. influenzae, representing 1.7% of the total band volume,
was detected in a single T-RFLP profile (patient 15). A
band consistent with that produced by S. maltophilia was
detected in the T-RFLP profiles generated from two
patients (patients 1 and 2), representing 1.6% and 5.5%
of the total band volume respectively. A band was also
detected in the RT-T-RFLP profile from a third sample
(patient 5), where it represented 18% of the total band
volume. No band of a length corresponding to S. aureus
was detected.

The number of T-RF bands detected above a threshold of 0.1% of the
total lane signal volume is shown for both the T-RFLP and RT-T-RFLP
profiles generated from each of the 17 samples. Standard deviations
for average values are shown in brackets.

Hierarchical cluster analysis
A dendrogram was derived by hierarchical cluster analysis
using the Dice measure for all of the T-RFLP and RT-TRFLP generated profiles (Figure 3). This showed that for
the majority (13 of 17) patients studied, the T-RFLP and
RT-T-RFLP profiles from the same sample clustered more
closely than any other profile. However, profiles were
observed in two instances that more closely matched
those of other individuals (patients 3 and 9 and patients
1 and 16, Figure 3).
Healthy, non-CF samples
Between 18 and 54 individual T-RF bands were detected
in the T-RFLP profiles generated from the healthy, non CF
sputa. On average 29 (± 10) T-RF bands were detected in
each profile.

A total of 556 individual T-RF bands were resolved in the
19 samples analysed. These represented 210 different T-RF
band lengths. T-RF bands of a given length were detected
in between 1 and 18 of the 19 samples, being detected in
2.65 samples (± 3.67) on average. Of these 210 T-RF band
lengths, 81 were detected in both the CF and non CF sputum profiles, 129 were detected in the healthy sample set
only, and 114 were detected in the CF only.

Profiles generated from healthy sputum were more similar than profiles generated from CF sputum, with a greater
level of overlap between the T-RF bands lengths detected
in the profiles generated. In the CF sample set, no T-RF
band length was detected in more than 41.1 % of profiles,
with 39% of T-RF band lengths detected in a single profile
only, and 22.2% of T-RF band lengths detected in two profiles, only. By comparison, only 21.9% and 12.2% of T-RF
band lengths were detected in one or two healthy sputum
profiles respectively. Further, 14 different T-RF band
lengths were detected in 50% or more of healthy profiles
and 4 were detected in more that 75% of healthy profiles.
Of the 14 T-RF band lengths detected in 50% or more of
healthy sample profiles, 5 were not detected in the CF
sample set at all, 3 were detected in a single sample only,
two were detected in two profiles, two in three profiles,
one in four profiles and one in 6 profiles.
None of the profiles generated from healthy sputa were
found to contain T-RF bands of lengths corresponding to
the recognised CF pathogens P. aeruginosa, B. cepacia complex, S. aureus, or H. influenzae. A T-RF band of 214 bases
was resolved in 5 of the 19 healthy profiles. This is consistent with the T-RF band produced by both five different
species (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Fusobacterium gonidoformans, Aeromonas hydrophila, Shewanella alga, Vibrio
wodanis), of which Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is a recognised CF pathogen.
Of the 209 band lengths detected in the RT-T-RFLP profiles, 118 (56.4%) were not detected in the profiles generated from the healthy sputum sample set whatsoever.
Hierarchical cluster analysis, using Dice similarity measure, was performed on the T-RFLP profiles generated from
CF and non-CF samples. The dendrogram that was generated is shown in Figure 4. It was found that there was complete separation of cluster groupings between CF and nonCF samples.

Discussion
This study addresses important questions about the activity of bacteria in infections. Recently, it has been shown
that many bacterial species not previously associated with
CF lung infections, could be detected when molecular
biological approaches were applied to the study of sputa
[10,19]. These studies also showed that many species in
CF sputum were facultative or obligate anaerobes. This
study shows that the majority of these species were
metabolically active. Potentially, this has important
implications for treatment and it is now critical to determine what impact these species have on lung disease and
to identify their clinical significance.

The application to clinical studies of the combined
approaches used here is novel. These approaches are
robust and have previously been shown to be highly
reproducible [data not shown, [10,12]]. Here it was found
that, on average, each patient had more than 22 metabolically active bacterial species per sputum sample. This represented a statistically significant difference over species
number identified through T-RFLP alone (P ≤ 0.001). This
finding makes it important to determine the role of metabolically active bacteria in lung pathogenesis. Some species may emerge as frank pathogens. However, even active
bacterial species that might be considered "avirulent" may
play an important indirect role; for example, it has been
demonstrated that avirulent oropharyngeal flora can
cause an upregulation of virulence genes and consequentially pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa [20].
In certain cases, the T-RFLP profile and RT-T-RFLP profile
were found by visual comparison to be similar. To provide
a more robust analysis, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis
(HCA) was used. HCA demonstrated that there was typically greater similarity between profiles generated from
individual samples than any other individual. This
implies that each patient has an individual collection of
typically active bacteria. The lack of HCA clustering
according to technique – i.e. discrete groups of T-RFLP
profiles and RT-T-RFLP profiles – suggests that the same
groups of species are not either "present" or "active" in different individuals. This reinforces the requirement for
management to be highly specific for each individual
patient, a concept that up to now has been put into practice based on clinical experience without particular scientific backing. Moreover, it may explain the differential
response of patients, at apparently similar stages of CF
lung disease, to antibiotic regimes.
Marked differences in T-RFLP and RT-T-RFLP profiles were
however observed in many cases. For example, in 39.6%
of banding positions, a signal was detected in the RT-TRFLP profile, but not in the corresponding T-RFLP profile.
This was not artefactual – there was no significant difference in the overall distribution of the total lane volume in
the profiles generated by T-RFLP and RT-T-RFLP profiling.
In the case of a signal not being detected in the corresponding T-RFLP profile, it is likely that cells of an individual species were present in low numbers, but exhibited
very high metabolic rates. When assessing relative levels of
metabolic activity, it should be noted the number of
ribosomal gene operons in different bacterial species varies. For example, Rickettsia prowazekii and Mycoplasma
pneumoniae have only one ribosomal operon [21,22],
whereas Clostridium paradoxum has 15 ribosomal operons
[23]. Therefore, in a diverse bacterial community such as
is present in the CF lung this variation will influence the
apparent abundance of individual bands in T-RFLP pro-

http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/49

files. The impact of this phenomenon on T-RFLP profiles
has yet to be determined as many bands have no species
assignation currently (only ~18% of T-RF band lengths
match a band length generated from published sequence
data). Moreover, even if all bands were associated with
individual species, currently just over one hundred species
[24] have been fully sequenced. Iteratively, this will
become less problematic as more band-species linkages
and genome sequences become available.
In the case of bands not being detected in the corresponding RT-T-RFLP analysis, it is likely that these bacteria were
either dead or active at very low metabolic rates. The identification of bands in RT-T-RFLP profiles but absent in the
corresponding T-RFLP profile from the same sample
therefore suggests that these species are highly active but
present in numbers below the threshold of detection. The
most interesting such case was the identification of a band
corresponding to B. cepacia complex, a known CF pathogen, in RT-T-RFLP profiles but not the corresponding TRFLP profiles. This suggests that B. cepacia complex is
present in relatively low numbers, but is highly metabolically active. Compared to P. aeruginosa, B. cepacia complex
infects only a small proportion of CF patients, but its
impact on survival is significant [25]. Further, the clinical
outcome of CF patients colonised by B. cepacia complex is
much poorer following lung transplantation than their
non-infected counterparts [26,27]. For these reasons, the
detection of strains of B. cepacia complex using these
approaches will therefore be carefully monitored in future
studies.
The lungs of all individuals are exposed to transient bacteria both that originate both in the oropharyngeal flora
and the wider environment. For the detection of such a
large number of metabolically active bacterial species in
CF sputum to be significant it must be established that
they are not due to contamination.
Strenuous attempts were made when processing the sputum samples analysed here to remove bacteria that may
have adhered to the sputum bolus during its passage
through the upper airways. Further comparisons between
the bacterial populations found in CF sputa with those
found in mouthwashes obtained from the same patients
(data not shown) suggest that there is no significant crosscontamination. Further, here we have analysed the bacterial communities found in sputum obtained from
healthy, non-CF individuals. It was found that the majority of the metabolically active bacterial species detected in
the CF sputa were not detected at all in non-CF sputa and
that bacterial profiles generated from healthy individuals
show both a high degree of conservation, and a distinct
dissimilarity to those generated from CF sputa. Further,
the detection of metabolically active bacterial species in

Respiratory Research 2005, 6:49

both CF sputum and either CF oropharyngeal community
or non-CF sputum is not necessarily an indication of contamination. Bacterial species colonising the CF lung
almost certainly derive from either transient bacterial species to which we are all exposed, or to oropharyngeal
flora. Therefore, their presence in sputum may well indicate genuine lung colonisation.

http://respiratory-research.com/content/6/1/49

that the majority of species detected in samples from the
CF lung may play important roles in lung infections. The
roles of these bacteria in the pathogenic process occurring
in the CF lung are therefore worthy of much further investigation. Moreover, this approach may prove very valuable
clinically in the study of many other microbial infections.

Authors' contributions
Like any other novel approach, data interpretation must
be carried out with caution. However, more studies using
this and complementary approaches will build upon this
characterisation of the complex bacterial community colonising the CF lung. Moreover, this approach can be
applied to many other infectious diseases of single or polymicrobial origin. Other diagnostic systems such as gene
array applications have clear diagnostic potential
[reviewed in [28]]. By their nature however, they can only
detect signature sequences for bacteria that have been
deposited on the supporting matrix and are, therefore,
"closed" systems. The RT-T-RFLP approach that we
describe here is an open system where no prior assumptions have been made about the species present in the
clinical sample and may, as such, be more flexible. For
diagnosis, the RT-T-RFLP system will be developed
through the construction of a large database containing
digest patterns for individual species. In turn, this will
provide clinicians with diagnostic identifications tied to
probability value scores. This process translates into more
rapid detection – providing results in hours rather than
days. This can be equated easily to cost savings in terms of
operator time and, where relevant, hospital bed occupancy. Also, there are benefits in terms of more
appropriate drug selection. Apart from likely cost savings,
this will be particularly important in reducing the impact
of long term antibiotic use on patients e.g. renal damage.

The RT-T-RFLP system can offer flexibility in other ways.
By switching the PCR primers used, it has the potential to
reveal diagnostic information at either the sub-species
level, or for fungal or viral infections. Moreover, RT-TRFLP system can be coupled with Quantitative PCR techniques [29]. With development, RT-T-RFLP has the potential to rapidly assess treatment efficacy by monitoring
bacterial viability within clinical samples taken from an
individual patient. This monitoring would provide clinicians with data with which to make informed decisions
e.g. on dosage modifications or more profound alterations in therapy. Through such studies, this may provide
fresh insights into the process of infection in a wide range
of respiratory diseases.
