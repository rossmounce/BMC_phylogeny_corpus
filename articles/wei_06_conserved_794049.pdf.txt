Abstract
Background: Staphylococcus epidermidis, long regarded as an innocuous commensal bacterium of the human skin, is the
most frequent cause of nosocomial infections associated with implanted medical devices. This conditional pathogen
provides a model of choice to study genome landmarks correlated with the transition between commensalism and
pathogenicity. Traditional investigations stress differences in gene content. We focused on conserved genes that have
accumulated small mutation differences during the transition.
Results: A comparison of strain ATCC12228, a non-biofilm forming, non-infection associated strain and strain RP62A,
a methicillin-resistant biofilm clinical isolate, revealed consistent variation, mostly single-nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs), in orthologous genes in addition to the previously investigated global changes in gene clusters. This
polymorphism, scattered throughout the genome, may reveal genes that contribute to adaptation of the bacteria to
different environmental stimuli, allowing them to shift from commensalism to pathogenicity. SNPs were detected in 931
pairs of orthologs with identical gene length, accounting for approximately 45% of the total pairs of orthologs. Assuming
that non-synonymous mutations would mark recent evolution, and hence be associated to the onset of the pathogenic
process, analysis of ratios of non-synonymous SNPs vs synonymous SNPs suggested hypotheses about possible
pathogenicity determinants. The N/S ratios for virulence factors and surface proteins differed significantly from that of
average SNPs. Of those gene pairs, 40 showed a disproportionate distribution of dN vs dS. Among those, the presence
of the gene encoding methionine sulfoxide reductase suggested a possible involvement of reactive oxygen species. This
led us to uncover that the infection associated strain was significantly more resistant to hydrogen peroxide and paraquat
than the environmental strain. Some 16 genes of the list were of unknown function. We could suggest however that they
were likely to belong to surface proteins or considered in priority as important for pathogenicity.
Conclusion: Our study proposed a novel approach to identify genes involved in pathogenic processes and provided
some insight about the molecular mechanisms leading a commensal inhabitant to become an invasive pathogen.

Background
Emerging diseases have been a matter of great concern
recently: the sudden appearance of SARS and the recent
spread of bird's flu raise the question of how microbes
evolve into pathogens to human not only an important
but also an urgent question to answer. Most microbes
have a benign symbiotic relationship with humans and
only cause infections to healthy individuals under limited
conditions. Staphylococcus epidermidis is such an opportunistic pathogen which is a common member of the normal
flora of our skin and mucous membranes. But on certain
occasions, the presence of S. epidermidis as a contaminant
of medical devices, or breach of the skin by trauma or
inoculation needles, makes it emerge as a causative agent
of infections [1]. As biomedical devices are increasingly
used in medical practice, a major complication due to S.
epidermidis infection when using these devices is affecting
several millions of patients worldwide each year [2].
The pathogenic process of foreign-body-associated infections with S. epidermidis is characterized by the ability of
this species to colonize polymer surfaces by the formation
of multilayered cell clusters, which are enveloped and
protected by an amorphous slimy material to form a biofilm [3-5]. Most genetic and biochemical evidence has
shown that polysaccharide intercellular adhesion (PIA)
production [6], mediated by the icaABCD operon [7-9], is
crucial in biofilm fomation. S. epidermidis does not produce components that are easily recognized as virulence
factors, such as toxins or aggressive degradative exoenzymes [10]. Genetic manipulation of S. epidermidis has
been difficult so far, limiting efforts that would elucidate
the molecular basic of its pathogenicity. The analysis of
bacterial genome sequences provides us with an alternative way to investigate some of the constraints that might
pave the way from commensalism to pathogenicity in this
species.
Staphylococcus epidermidis is one of the most commonly
isolated bacterial pathogens in hospitals because of its
large numbers and ubiquitous distribution. Environmental S. epidermidis strains differ significantly in their invasive and ability to form biofilm. Two complete genomes
of S. epidermidis strains have been sequenced, one is ATCC
12228, a non-biofilm forming/non-infection associated
strain, and another one is RP62A (also called
ATCC35984), an infectious and biofilm forming strain
[11,12]. Both strains are highly similar in genome
sequence, and we tried to see whether some particular features might be correlated with the surviving ability of the
organisms in certain environment, allowing us to uncover
processes that might be important for the transition
between a commensal life style, and a pathogenic behavior. In previous comparative genomics studies, the most
obvious differences between these genome pairs revealed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/112

the loss or gain of large DNA segments [13]. Further comparative studies of S. epidermidis with other staphylococcal
species indicated that the majority of the genes unique to
a given strain or species is also related to the presence or
absence of prophages and genomic islands. In the absence
of other criteria to define virulence, some of these genes
were proposed to be the main causes of pathogenicity and
virulence [12]. However, acquisition of those genes has
repeatedly been reported to be insufficient to trigger a
pathogenic response [14]. For example, it has been discovered that the ATCC12228 and RP62A strains share
most of the possible pathogenic factors. As a case in point,
the cap operon encoding the polyglutamate capsule and
being recognized as a major virulence factor in Bacillus
anthracis, has been found to be integrated into the
genomes of both S. epidermidis RP62A and ATCC12228,
while the latter is a non-infectious strain [12,15]. In addition to gross differences displayed as genomic islands and
unique genes, Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)
have also been found to widely exist in the chromosomes
of the two strains, especially in some genes with cell envelope functions [12]. Therefore, pathogenicity appears to
be a complex phenomenon which could be accounted for
not only by large genetic differences, but also by small variations in gene contents. This prompted us to perform a
detailed SNPs comparative analysis between S. epidermidis
ATCC12228 and RP62A, complementing the previous
approaches used to differentiate pathogenic strains from
non-pathogenic ones [16-18]. Assuming that pathogens
have evolved recently [19], the amount of small genetic
variations that would be accumulated in the genome
sequences might not have had time to undergo purifying
selection, thus revealing some of the genes that are important for pathogenic processes. Analyzing those variations,
mostly SNPs, we expected to find genes bearing landmarks of recent evolution, and which may contribute to
the pathogenesis of the bacterium. In this paper, we
focused on the systematic SNP analysis between a pair of
infectious and non-infectious strains of S. epidermidis, in
particular by comparing synonymous and non-synonymous mutations in orthologous gene pairs. The genes displaying higher dN/dS rate, including genes of unknown
function, were analyzed in relation with function possibly
associated to pathogenicity.

Results
Small variations between the genomes of two S.
epidermidis strains
The S. epidermidis RP62A and ATCC12228 chromosomes
are 2,616,530 bp and 2,499,279 bp long, respectively
[11,12]. Beside large segments coding for genes present in
one genome and absent in the other, many small scale
genetic variations which affected an individual gene or a
small numbers of genes (< 10 CDSs) were dispersed
throughout nearly all of both chromosomes, revealing

extensive divergence between both species. The comparison of the insertions and deletions (indels) differentiating
the two genome sequences showed that such events generally involved small-scale variations (see Additional file
1). In addition to indels, a total of 10,297 SNPs were
found in the genome of S. epidermidis ATCC12228 when
compared to that of strain RP62A [12]. These small-scale
variations, mostly SNPs, might contribute to the different
phenotypes of the two strains. We therefore focused on
the SNPs of the orthologous genes to explore how they
could contribute to adaptation of the bacteria to various
environmental stimuli allowing them to shift from commensalism to pathogenicity.

of identical length, 118 pairs were identical to each other
at the amino acid level, while the other 813 pairs (87%)
displayed some changes in their amino acid sequence. In
addition, more complex insertion/deletion events and
related variations were observed in 263 pairs of orthologs.
Pathogenicity-related genes and highly expressed proteins
genes evolve differently
Pathogenicity in warm blooded vertebrates is expected to
have arisen recently (at the living organisms evolution
time scale). Mutations occurring during that period
should have started more or less randomly, while selection pressure would have retained only some of them.
This prompted us to measure the contribution of synonymous mutations (presumably not changing the existing
fitness of the proteins) as compared to non-synonymous
mutations. In order to assess the effect of non-synonymous mutations upon the intraspecies differentiation of
the two S. epidermidis strains, we calculated the ratios of
total non-synonymous SNPs (N) vs total synonymous
SNPs (S) of all genes, with some emphasis on virulence
factors, surface proteins [12] and translation, ribosomal
structure and biogenesis-related proteins (see Additional
file 3 and file 4). This comparison would be a first proof

The S. epidermidis RP62A and ATCC12228 chromosomes
contain 2,494 and 2,419 predicted protein-coding
sequences (CDSs), respectively [11,12]. Of the 2,419 predicted genes encoded by the ATCC12228 chromosome,
2,053 (85%) have an ortholog in RP62A (Table 1). Most
of those genes are almost identical in sequence between
both organisms. SNPs were detected in 931 pairs of
orthologous genes with identical gene length, accounting
for approximately 45% of the orthologous genes set (see
Additional file 2). Among those orthologs with SNPs and

Distribution of dN vs dS of SNPs pairs of two S. epidermidis strains
Distribution of dN vs dS of SNPs pairs of two S. epidermidis strains. The distribution of dN vs dS mutations was represented according to the p-value calculated from the One-tail Z (or t∞) test. Figure 1A represents the numbers of SNPs pairs
falling into the different confidence level classes. Figure 1B shows the cumulative probability of all SNPs pairs. Figure 1C plots
the distribution of dN/dS of all SNPs pairs. All plots are color-coded according to different intervals: red for [0, 0.05), orange
for [0.05, 0.1), green for (0.9, 0.95], blue for (0.95, 1], pink for others.

of concept, while we were trying to uncover genes' illuminating or unexpected functions that would, in this way,
suggest a participation in the evolution of pathogenicity.
The N/S ratios for virulence factors and surface proteins
differed significantly from that of all SNPs. In contrast,
translation-related proteins also showed a significant bias
when compared to total SNPs, but displayed mostly synonymous substitutions, indicative of a selective stabilization process leading to purifying selection(Table 2). This
analysis shows that virulence factors and surface proteins
evolved quickly, in parallel with the pathogenicity environment. That this is significant is emphasized by the
observation that translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis-related proteins, which are submitted to considerable structural and functional constraints and are highly
expressed, evolved slowly (there is hardly any change in
protein sequence, while the gene sequence has evolved)
[20].
To identify groups of SNPs genes differing in their evolution pattern, the dS and dN of each SNPs pairs of the two
S. epidermidis strains were calculated and the distribution
of individual SNPs pairs were analyzed using the one-tail
Z (or t∞) test (see Additional file 5). Among 931 pairs of
orthologs with SNPs, 213 (23%) pairs had a majority of
non-synonymous substitutions (dN > dS), while the
remaining 718 (77%) pairs had a majority of synonymous mutations (Figure 1A and 1B). This suggested that
the majority of orthologs with SNPs suffer considerable

selection constraints, indicative of adaptation to similar
environments for both strains. The others, in contrast,
may contribute to the bacterial pathogenesis process during the establishment of infection. In those synonymous
pairs, we therefore restricted our analysis to the confidence interval of p < 0.1 of dS/dN to find what kinds of
genes significantly suffered purifying selection pressures.
As mentioned above, many genes of the translation
machinery and energy production were found in that category. It is worth noticing that genes involved in the translation machinery, such as ribosomal proteins and tRNA
methyltransferases, are expected to be expressed at a high
level in many transcriptome studies [21].
Genes potentially involved in pathogenicity
A total of 40 genes showed a significantly disproportionate distribution of dN vs dS with p-value < 0.10 (Figure 1A
and Table 3). In standard statistical analyses, p < 0.05 is
the level traditionally considered significant; however, if
we represented the relative amount of those genes, the
plot distribution of dN/dS (Figure 1C) shows a continuum that is worth exploring and may be relevant as providing putative signatures of adaptation to pathogenicity.
Because the organisms we have chosen are extremely similar, leading to very few differences between the two
genomes, the advantage of using a stringent statistical
constraint for discarding false positives will put aside false
negatives under conditions where we need to explore as
many paths as possible. Indeed, from the figure we can see

that 213 (23%) genes of the 931 SNP ortholog pairs are
under positive selection (dN/dS > 1), consistent with the
observation of other works [22] and strongly suggesting
that most, if not all of the retained non-synonymous
mutations are significant. Furthermore, the accumulation
of mutations in some genes can be the result of several
independent processes, with some submitted to positive
selection for variation, while others would only be
affected by drift, precluding, at this stage, a refined statistical analysis. We therefore decided for a compromise, and
chose a slightly larger sample, still significant at the p <
0.10 level (orange area), in order to see whether the genes
in that category pointed at particular functions non randomly, which would indicate that they are indeed significant. This approach is meant to propose genes as
candidates for further study of pathogenicity, and a small
number of false positives should not hinder further
research in the domain, while false negatives would eliminate important candidates. Interestingly, the genes thus
identified included phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) family peptides (SE0847), a Clp protease (SE0674), as well as
genes involved in osmoprotection. Finally, 16 of the nonsynonymous significant genes were of unknown function.
Careful analysis of these genes revealed however that they
were likely to belong to functions important for pathogenicity, as indicated in Table 3. Several of those genes
were counterparts of proteins generally conserved in Firmicutes (YvcD(SE0546), YheB(SE1527), YqfN(SE1247),
YlaF(SE0806),
YkyA(SE0790),
YfmM(SE2128),
YhfK(SE1745) and YqgE(SE1448)) and sometimes in
larger Bacterial clades (SE1986). YvcD is a TPR-repeat protein, which might interact with nucleic acids; YkyA has a
lipoprotein signal, and is similar to cell wall binding proteins; YqgE(SE1448) is similar to MultiDrug Efflux proteins and finally YfmM is likely to code for
polyphosphate-AMP phosphotransferase. The very fact
that they belong to this class of non synonymous SNPs
makes them interesting candidates for further studies of
pathogenicity.
Although the sequencing technique is quite accurate, the
error frequency in a finished sequence is thought to be
one error (frameshift or base substitution) in 103 to 105
bases [23]. To confirm the SNP sites identified in this
study, we chose the top 13 pairs of mostly non-synonymous substitutions proteins and carried out PCR experiments on their cognate gene to validate the corresponding
sequences. Sequences of the PCR products confirmed all
the SNP sites we identified from the orthologs analysis.
Two main groups were observed in the cluster of 40
orthologous pairs made of proteins with mostly non-synonymous substitutions: surface proteins, which are likely
under pressure to escape the host immune system, and
other genes that should be considered in priority as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/112

important for pathogenicity. Two conserved hypothetical
proteins (SE0265 and SE0378) predicted to localize in the
extracellular medium and several transmembrane proteins, such as transporter family proteins, belonged to the
first group. YkyA(SE0790), which contains a lipoprotein
signal and a hydrolase domain, might also be recognized
by the host immune defense. In the second group, several
proteins involved in lipid metabolism, likely to be important for S. epidermidis multiplying on skin, apparently
evolved faster in the pathogen. Genes encoding fosfomycin resistance protein FofB and beta-lactamase detected in
this group also may have evolved fast to benefit bacteria
trying to survive in their host. Genes involved in the formation of biofilms and osmoprotection were also found
in this group. PSMs belong to the class of surfactant peptides with putative biofilm-inhibitory properties. Repression of expression of PSMs in the biofilm stage enables
bacterial cells to adhere together and to evade the host
immune system. Several gene products were involved in
DNA recombination and repair (such as SE1170, SE1302
and SE1828) suggesting adaptation to some chemical
stress. A gene (coding for methionine sulfoxide reductase,
SE1042) involved in repair of Reactive Oxygen Species
(ROS) damage, a process supposed to be significantly
expressed upon infection [24], also suffered a high mutation rate. This prompted us to study the specific involvement of this process in the establishment of
pathogenicity. Although the exact in vivo process of
methionine oxygenation is not well established, it is supposed to be derived from ROS, in particular from reactions producing superoxide or H2O2 [25]. In an attempt to
explore whether this prediction could be substantiated,
both strains were challenged with increasing paraquat and
H2O2 concentrations: interestingly, we observed that S.
epidermidis ATCC12228 is indeed more sensitive to both
paraquat [26] and H2O2 than S. epidermidis RP62A, as predicted (Figure 2 and 3, see Additional file 6 and Additional file 7).
Finally, genes are often grouped in operons, forming functionally consistent transcription units. If our hypothesis
for the detection of genes important for pathogenesis is
correct, then we should expect that a mutation bias would
generally span entire operons when the corresponding
genes participate to the process of pathogenicity. We
found that genes making potential operons often displayed a collective increase in non-synonymous mutations (see Additional file 5). This is the case, for example,
of potA (se0797) and potB (se0798), which code for the
spermidine/putrescine ABC transporter.

Discussion
While an important topic for human health, pathogenicity is not the most prevalent development process for living organisms. Often, this particular way of life happens

as a new ecological niche (a possible host) is colonized by
organisms that were previously indifferent or simple commensals. Previous work concluded, in general, that
genome segments, often named pathogenicity islands,
were the landmarks of pathogenic processes [27]. These
islands are generally supposed to be the result of Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). HGT is a general process of gene
acquisition by bacteria, where it may be associated to control of the background mutation level [28]. In Firmicutes,
HGT is often the result of phage infection [29]. Bacteriophages can subsequently remain in the genome as functional (SPbeta in B. subtilis, for example) or more or less
defective prophages (PBX, Skin, and similar elements). In
the case of S. epidermidis, this type of analysis led Gill et al.
to conclude that HGT was the major contribution to pathogenicity in the pathogenic strain they analyzed [12].
However, acquisition of virulence genes has repeatedly
been found to be insufficient to trigger a pathogenic
response. As a case in point, the cap operon, encoding the
presumably virulence-associated polyglutamate capsule is
present in both the commensal and pathogenic S. epidermidis strains [15]. The absence/presence of the ica operon
that produces a biofilm exopolysaccharide was taken as
the clearest genetic difference contributing to the different
phenotype of two S. epidermidis strains [8,9]. However,
the prevalence of icaADBC in commensal strains did not
differ from that in invasive strains, indicating that other

factors should been involved in pathogenesis [14]. All this
indicates that important information about the development of pathogenic processes has been overlooked by the
standard approaches focusing on HGT analysis. The
small-scale variations which pepper the chromosomes of
the commensal and pathogenic strains were not explored
in detail. In order to gain further insight into the pathogenicity process, we studied the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) between the orthologous gene pairs of
the pathogenic and the commensal S. epidermidis strains
of interest.
SNP analysis rests obviously on the quality of the genome
sequences determination. The error frequency in a finished sequence has rarely been precisely measured. A
common belief is that anywhere between one error in 103
to 105 bases, depending on the project. In order to evaluate the impact of sequencing errors on our analysis,
approximately 23 kb of DNA sequence was re-sequenced
after PCR amplification of 13 pairs of orthologs from both
strains. 11 new SNP sites (5 and 6 in strains ATCC12228
and RP62A, respectively) were retrieved when the new
sequences were compared to published genome
sequences. If we take those new sites as sequencing errors,
and not PCR errors or recent mutations, then the average
error frequency is 4.8 errors in 104 bases. This shows that,
while we may have missed some interesting genes, our

approach is validated with the present available quality of
genome sequences.
Analysis of the ratios of total non-synonymous SNPs vs
total synonymous SNPs showed that N/S ratios for virulence factors and surface proteins differed significantly
from that of total SNPs. While random mutations and
evolutionary drift should not favor one type of mutation
over the other one, genes related to pathogenic processes
may have evolved recently due to positive selection to fit
the pathogenic conditions [30]. Their evolution could be
compared to that of genes belonging to translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis (labeled according to the
COG classification), which are submitted to purifying
selection because of the general optimization of the translation process in the course of evolution. As expected, the
latter were mostly submitted to synonymous mutations.
This is remarkable and consistent with the interpretation
of Drummond and colleagues who argued that highly
expressed proteins evolve slowly because of the severe
selective pressure on highly expressed proteins to avoid
misfolding even when they are mistranslated [20]. This
interpretation further supports the hypothesis that non

The percentages of identical vs. non-identical genes
among the orthologs of those groups (virulence factors,
surface proteins, translation-related genes and total genes)
were also compared (see Additional file 9). Interestingly,
the ratio of non-identical vs. identical genes coding for
surface proteins differs significantly from that in translation-related genes and total genes, following the same
trend as the ratio of non-synonymous vs. synonymous
substitutions. This is not the case for virulence factors. The
percentage of non-identical vs. identical genes reflected
differences at the nucleic acids level, while the non-synonymous vs. synonymous differences emphasized the DNA
mutations that result in a change protein sequences. Proteins are the ultimate functional entities in an organism,
and this makes it reasonable to focus on the DNA mutations that change the coded amino acids, rather than
silent mutations.
Of the 931 SNPs orthologous pairs identified in this
study, a total of 40 genes showed a disproportionate distribution of dN/dS. Most are probably significant, as we
consistently found that when present the imbalanced dN/
dS distribution extended to genes common to an operon.
That they may play important roles in pathogenic processes is suggested by the presence in the list of genes coding for proteins that are likely to influence pathogenicity,
such as phenol-soluble modulin (PSM) family peptides
(SE0847) or the Clp protease (SE0674). PSMs, a class of
surfactant peptides with proinflammatory and putative
biofilm-inhibitory properties, presumably represent key
factors controlling the switch between the colonization
and disseminative stages of the pathogen. Suppression of
production of PSMs in the biofilm stage enables cells to
stick together and to evade the host immune defense [31].
ATP-dependent Clp proteases are involved in regulation
processes by proteolysis in many bacteria. They consist of
a proteolytic subunit, ClpP, which confers substrate specificity through association with ATPase subunits. Signature-tagged mutagenesis screening experiments have
demonstrated that ATP-dependent proteases are key factors in bacterial adaptation to environmental stress,
including ROS [32]. Little is known about clp gene regulation in pathogenic bacteria, despite the fact that many of
these genes play important roles in virulence, such as
ClpX in Staphylococcus aureus [33] and ClpB in Leishmania
sp. [34]. It seems plausible that these bifunctional chaperones/proteases may also modulate the activity of other
virulence factors [35] and it is therefore interesting to have
observed that a member of this class is evolving fast in the
S. epidermidis pair studied here. Genes involved in osmoprotection which may respond to high salt conditions in
cell agglomerations on human skin, such as gbsA (glycine

betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase) were also found among
the non-synonymous significant genes.
Surface proteins play a fundamental role in the interaction between the bacterial cell and its environment. In the
present case, several of the 40 non-synonymous genes, in
particular some genes with unknown function, have features suggesting that they code for surface proteins under
the pressure of escaping the host immune system. Interestingly, SE1527 and SE0790 are orthologous to surface proteins experimentally identified in one of Group A
Streptococcus (GAS) strains (SPY0792 and SPY2018) [36].
It may also be significant that two ribosomal proteins, for
which there is also some evidence of extracellular functions, were also found in their surface proteome. This
makes RpsL (SE0309) and RplC (SE1824), the two ribosomal proteins which have more non-synonymous substitutions than expected in our analysis more interesting.
RpsL, protein S12 of the small subunit of the ribosome is
known to control accuracy of translation, and this might
indeed play a role in pathogenicity [37]. Further work is
required to investigate this aspect as we can expect that
some of the genes identified are simply the result of random deviation from the average.
Yao et al have used microaray-based genome-wide comparison of clinical and commensal strains to identify
putative virulence factors in S. epidermidis [38]. 39 genes
were found to be more frequent among clinical strains
than commensal strains. Interestingly, we find that after
detailed comparison our 40 high-non-synonymous substitutions genes have no overlap with those 39 high-frequent genes in clinical strains. This is probably not
unexpected, for the following reasons. Firstly, we looked
for conserved genes rather than genes that would differ in
a variety of strains, and our study involves only orthologous pairs of genes in the two stains, while Yao et al
focused on those genes which showed disproportionate
difference in distribution between clinical and commensal strains. Second, our 40 high non-synonymous substitution genes were identified because they carry SNPs,
small differences which may not be detected by hybridization with the oligonucleotides of the microarray.
Under laboratory growth conditions, with plenty of
metabolites available, bacterial gene expression is typically dominated by the highly expressed genes involved in
transcription, protein biosynthesis, maturation and folding. In contrast, as shown for example in a study by Rollenhagen and Bumann, most of the genes highly
expressed in Salmonella enterica cells recovered from the
caecum differ considerably from those highly expressed in
bacteria located in the spleen [39]. The overall functional
profile of highly expressed genes suggests a marked shift
in transcriptional activity upon change in growth environ-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/112

ment. In this respect, some pathogenicity related genes are
likely to be highly expressed during infection to fight
against the host. Interestingly, we found that one of the
non-synonymous significant genes of the present study,
gene se2269 encoding dihydropteroate synthase and
recovered as a virulence-related antigen of a Gram-positive fish pathogen [40], was significantly more expressed
in RP62A than in ATCC12228 (unpublished data).
Since pathogenicity is a recent form of lifestyle for an
organism in evolution, we expected that genes involved in
the process would show a significant mutation pattern
[41]. Furthermore, we could expect that many of the corresponding mutations would not yet be adapted to the
"self" of the bacteria, as they would result from non-synonymous mutations in codons, leading to alteration of
the polypeptide sequence of the corresponding genes. Our
observations substantiated this hypothesis, showing a significant number of genes, often grouped in operons,
affected by non-synonymous mutations. In parallel – and
this can be seen as an internal validation of our hypothesis – we observed that genes of the translation machinery,
expected to be expressed at a high level (and hence under
a "mutator" pressure) were indeed mutated, but that the
corresponding mutations were usually of the synonymous
class. This is easily accounted for by the enormous selection pressure operating on the translation machinery
(made of proteins interacting with each other and with
highly conserved RNAs), which cannot easily accommodate mutations resulting in alteration of the corresponding proteins. Even if important for pathogenicity, these
genes would become invisible because the functional constraints would result in a purifying selection process.
However not all genes can be equally submitted to purifying selection and our approach reveals several genes of the
general cell machinery, as possibly important for pathogenicity. As a case in point, we found one gene (se1042)
coding for peptide methionine sulfoxide reductase,
involved in protection against ROS, which could probably
be such an important candidate for adaptation to pathogenicity [24,25]. As the clpB gene found in our non-synonymous set also may point to adaptation to ROS, we
explored the differential resistance to H2O2 and paraquat
of the environmental species as compared to the pathogen
(Figure 2 and 3, see Additional file 6 and file 7) and our
experiments substantiated the interest of our approach to
identify specific pathways of evolution to pathogenicity.
In the same way a (presumably divalent) cation transporter SE0773 might be involved in the scavenging of
divalent metals such as magnesium, manganese, iron or
cobalt during infection. Gene se2128 might code for
polyphosphate-AMP phosphotransferase, an observation
that would support interest for the poorly explored role of
polyphosphate in cells and its possible involvement in
pathogenicity [42]. Others are involved in biofilm forma-

tion, an important contribution to virulence in several
pathogenic bacteria [43], as they considerably limit the
success of both antibiotic treatment and the human
immune defense. Gene expression profiling of the S. epidermidis biofilm was analyzed and some significant metabolic shift was found between the planktonic and the
biofilm modes of growth [31].

Conclusion
In this paper, a SNPs comparative approach was developed to identify conserved genes possibly involved in
pathogenicity by measuring their selective pressure in the
gene pairs of non-infection associated S. epidermidis strain
ATCC12228 and biofilm-forming strain RP62A. Our
approach identified new genes that may be involved in
pathogenesis, including some genes with unknown function. These results may provide fresh insight into discovering the genes that determine the success of S. epidermidis
as an opportunistic pathogen. Complementing the previous methodologies which mainly focused on horizontal
gene transfer, extensive SNPs investigations on more pathogens will facilitate our understanding of the path from
commensalism to pathogenicity, a crucial prerequisite for
designing therapeutic interventions directed to control
pathogen infections.

Methods
Orthologous genes identification
For the identification of orthologous genes, all predicted
CDSs from the S. epidermidis RP62A and ATCC12228
genomes were searched against each other locally using
BLASTP [44]. Those genes that matched a non-self
genomic sequence at P value of < = 10-5, and identity > =
35%, matching at least 75% of the length of both query
and subject sequences were considered homologous (non
strain-specific genes). Of these homologous pairs, the
bidirectional-best match was defined as an orthologous
group. Identical nucleic acid sequence pairs, SNPs and
insertion/deletions of the genes' pairs of orthologs
between the two S. epidermidis genomes were identified
using BLASTN.
SNPs analysis
The Nei-Gojobori (NG) method [45] was applied for estimating dS and dN of the SNPs pairs of S. epidermidis
strains with minor modifications. The ratio of transition
to transversion changes (R) was obtained by counting the
total numbers of transitions to transversions that were
observed in the entire set of orthologous pairs of the two
species and adjusted using Kimura's 2-parameters method
[46]. The adjusted R computed from our data was
2.330294 and used in the following computation. We
also applied the one-tail Z (or t∞) test to conduct the statistical test of the positiveness of dN – dS. The estimated
dS and dN, standard error (S.E.), Z-scores and their corre-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/112

sponding p-values were presented in the additional file 5.
To explore the distribution of dN/dS, we applied the
transformation f (k) = log(k + 0.001) as described in other
works[20,47].
H2O2 and paraquat sensitivity analysis
We grew the S. epidermidis strains at different concentration of H2O2 and measured the growth curve of the strains
by reading OD595 every one hour. Overnight bacterial cultures at (OD595 approximately 1.2) were added to fresh
TSB(Tryptone Soya Broth) at a 1:100 dilution, and different concentrations of H2O2 (0, 1%, 5%, 10% and 15%)
were added at the same time. Cells were grown at 37°C,
agitated at, 220 rpm and the absorbancy of the culture
(OD595) was followed every one hour.

MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) assay of
paraquat (sigma) by broth dilution was performed
according to NCCLS (National Committee for Clinical
Laboratory Standards) [48]. The bacterial inoculum was
prepared using a 3–4 h broth culture of each isolates
adjusted to a turbidity equivalent to a 0.5 McFarland
standard, diluted in CAMHB to achieve a final concentration of 5 × 105 CFU/ml in the test tube. Broth not containing an antimicrobial agent is inoculated as a control for
organism viability, and E.coli ATCC 25922 was used as a
test quality control strain. The bacteria were cultured in
MH broth (OXOID) with different concentration of
paraquat (from 1 mM to 8 mM) and incubated at 35°C
for 16–20 h. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of paraquat giving complete inhibition of visible
growth. The growth of bacteria incubated with lower concentration paraquat than MIC was measured by OD600.
PCR validation
In order to get PCR fragments containing SNPs, we
designed primers by Primer Premier 5.0. The primers
sequences are listed in Additional file 8. We used Pfu DNA
polymerase (Tiangen Biotechnology Co., Ltd) to ensure
high-fidelity synthesis. Amplifications were carried out in
a thermocycler (GeneAmp PCR system 9700) through the
following temperature program: 1 cycle of 5 min at 94°C;
30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 60 s at 55°C, and 60 s at 72°C;
and finally 1 cycle at 72°C for 7 min. The PCR products
were purified by agarose gel DNA purification kit (TaKaRa
Biotechnology Co., Ltd) and sequenced by Shanghai Invitrogen Biotechnology Co., Ltd.
