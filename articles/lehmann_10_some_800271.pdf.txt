Drosophila genes are caused by intron sliding or
tandem duplication

Abstract
Background: Positions of spliceosomal introns are often conserved between remotely related genes. Introns that
reside in non-conserved positions are either novel or remnants of frequent losses of introns in some evolutionary
lineages. A recent gain of such introns is difficult to prove. However, introns verified as novel are needed to evaluate
contemporary processes of intron gain.
Results: We identified 25 unambiguous cases of novel intron positions in 31 Drosophila genes that exhibit near intron
pairs (NIPs). Here, a NIP consists of an ancient and a novel intron position that are separated by less than 32 nt. Within a
single gene, such closely-spaced introns are very unlikely to have coexisted. In most cases, therefore, the ancient intron
position must have disappeared in favour of the novel one. A survey for NIPs among 12 Drosophila genomes identifies
intron sliding (migration) as one of the more frequent causes of novel intron positions. Other novel introns seem to
have been gained by regional tandem duplications of coding sequences containing a proto-splice site.
Conclusions: Recent intron gains sometimes appear to have arisen by duplication of exonic sequences and
subsequent intronization of one of the copies. Intron migration and exon duplication together may account for a
significant amount of novel intron positions in conserved coding sequences.
Background
Comparative studies of spliceosomal intron densities
have suggested relatively high rates of intron gain during
eukaryote evolution [1,2]. The establishment of introns
within fast-evolving genes appears to be an infrequent,
but common process involving, for example, intronization of exonic sequences [3-5]. However, recent gains of
introns inside of conserved coding sequences (CDS),
often equated with the usage of novel intron positions,
appear to be a rare and poorly understood phenomenon
[6]. At least six mechanisms (see Figure 1 for a schematic
overview) have been proposed to explain novel intron
positions within conserved open reading frames (ORFs):
(1) insertion of a self-splicing type II intron via reverse
splicing [7]; (2) insertion of a spliceosomal intron via
reverse splicing into a new position [8]; (3) partial tandem

duplication of an exon including a cryptic AG/GY splice
motif [7]; (4) insertion of a transposable element [9]; (5)
gene conversion from an intron-containing site into a
previously intron-less paralogous site [10]; and (6) intron
sliding [11]. Only the last three pathways are supported
by undisputed, albeit anecdotal, evidence [10,12,13].
Recently, a study on Daphnia populations [14] suggested
another intron gain mechanism: The repair of DNA double-strand breaks using small segmental insertions.
The analysis of near intron pairs [15] allows a systematic investigation of intron gain mechanisms. A near
intron pair (NIP) consists of two intron positions that
exist in orthologous genes at nearby locations. Exon sizes
smaller than about 50 nt are relatively rare [16] and in
general functionally detrimental [17]. Thus, such nearby
introns typically exclude each other within a single gene.
Accordingly, one of these introns must be evolutionarily
younger and should define a monophyletic group. By
using NIPs to determine the time at which the younger
introns were gained, it can be avoided to erroneously

Figure 1 Overview on mechanisms proposed for the emergence of novel intron positions within conserved ORFs. It is commonly assumed
that the first mechanism was responsible for the emergence of spliceosomal introns in ancient eukaryotes. More recent intron gains or intron position
changes may be caused by the other mechanisms shown.

identify those introns as novel that have been lost independently in multiple lineages.
Here we use the relatively recently diverged genomes of
12 Drosophila species [18] to identify recent intron gain
events in a comparative analysis of gene structures and
evaluate possible mechanisms of their origin. In contrast
to previous attempts to identify intron loss and gain in
Drosophila [19,20], we chose the NIP approach instead of
Dollo parsimony to restrict our analysis to introns for
which the evidence of intron gain is more unambiguous.
We could identify 31 NIPs within Drosophila.
Their distribution supports the known species phylogeny. Both introns of a NIP were evaluated for sequence
similarity to introns, neighboring exons and transposable
elements and screened for repetitiveness and potentially
meaningful secondary structures, using the ancient, plesiomorphic intron of the NIP as control. In addition, we
looked for cryptic splice signals in the adjacent exonic
and intronic sequences. There is evidence for intron sliding in 9 of the 31 Drosophila NIPs, while 5 other cases
probably arose by tandem duplications within the ORF. In
contrast, we found no evidence for any intron insertion
mechanism based on alien sequences in our data set.

Age of NIPs

Results and Discussion
Compilation and characterization of the NIP data set

NIPs are suitable phylogenetic markers for Drosophila
species

We started with 12386 sets of orthologous protein-coding
genes of Drosophila species (Methods). After an automatic NIP extraction alignment procedure, we obtained
122 NIP regions containing two or more near introns
(NIP distance < 50 nt). These were manually inspected
for splice site, alignment and conservation validity, resulting in 40 regions comprising 41 NIPs. Based on the frequency of short exons and NIP distances within
Drosophila (data not shown), we decided to decrease the
maximal allowed intron distance to 31 nt, which resulted
in 35 alignment regions comprising 36 NIPs (Additional
files 1 and 2).
Since there was an alternative site consistent with the
old (plesiomorphic) intron position that could not be
clearly excluded by splice site sequence analysis, we evaluated seven NIP candidates experimentally. As no EST
data supported these NIPs, we performed RT-PCR or
genomic PCR experiments in some crucial species (Additional file 3). Our analysis confirmed 2 of the investigated
NIPs (FBgn0015572, FBgn0046689). The remaining 5
cases were reducible to one intron position. Three of
these cases were based on sequence errors that could be
corrected by genomic PCR or RT-PCR (FBgn0036324,
FBgn0027055, FBgn0046689). One NIP candidate represented a frame shift mutation that led to an incorrectly
annotated splice site (FBgn0038858). In the last case
(FBgn0082831), intron sliding has happened only at the 3'
splice site.

NIPs were primarily introduced as reliable phylogenetic
markers for insect evolution [15]. The well-known phylogeny of Drosophila [18] opens the possibility to verify
the suitability of NIPs for phylogenetic analyses of recent
radiations (Figure 2). Phylogenetically informative NIPs
within Drosophila were identified using the aforementioned arthropod outgroup species. Together, 7 synapomorphic (shared derived) and 11 autapomorphic
(species-specific) NIP characters appeared during the
evolution of the genus Drosophila. The subgenus Drosophila, the species groups obscura and melanogaster, the
sister relationship between the melanogaster and the
obscura species groups and as well as the melanogaster
species subgroup are supported by at least one synapomorphically distributed NIP (Figure 2). For 4 remaining
internal nodes (subtrees) and 8 remaining external nodes
(species) of the tree no supporting NIP evidence was
found.
Out of 31 NIPs, only one character distribution
(FBgn0003607, intron positions 117-1 and 118-1) contradicts the established tree of the 12 Drosophila species.
This NIP is clearly associated with a sliding event (see
below). The local nature of sliding makes independent
changes of intron position with identical results much
more likely than any of the other mechanisms, which
require independent targeting of the same genomic position. We conclude that NIPs could be reliable phylogenetic markers also for recent radiations. However, short

Not all of the remaining 31 NIPs contain introns that necessarily have been gained during the evolution of the
genus Drosophila. Using the intron distributions among
Drosophila and the arthropod outgroup species Glossina
morsitans, Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, Culex pipiens, Bombyx mori, Tribolium castaneum, Apis mellifera,
Nasonia vitripennis, Acyrthosiphon pisum, Pediculus
humanus, Daphnia pulex and Ixodes scapularis, we discovered that at least 25 intron positions of the 31 NIPs
have arisen during Drosophila radiation. 17 NIPs contain
exactly one novel intron position, whereas 4 other NIPs
consist of two different novel intron positions, which are
supported by other nearby introns in the outgroup species. The phase distribution of these 25 novel introns is
similar to the average intron phase distribution in Drosophila [19]: 13 of these introns are in phase 0 (52%), and 6
in phase 1 and phase 2, respectively (24%). For the 10
remaining NIPs, the relative age of intron positions could
not be determined either due to a lack of sufficient local
sequence similarity to orthologous gene structures outside of Drosophila or due to a lack of nearby introns in
outgroup sequences.

branch lengths, as observed between Drosophila species,
could critically limit the number of available characters.
Intron sliding accounts for a low but detectable level of
homoplasy in this type of character.
Intron migration into novel positions

Next, we evaluated possible evolutionary mechanisms
that had produced introns at novel positions. For all the
introns of the 31 NIPs, we could not find any relevant
sequence conservation to other introns, to transposons,
or to exons (data not shown). To control whether some of
the intron position changes resulted from intron sliding,
we evaluated all introns of the NIPs concerning properties that would be expected if a coordinated migration of
both splice sites occurred in relation to the former intron
and the CDS. These properties are: (1) There is no intermediate, intron-less state in the tree; (2) NIP distance is a
multiple of 3 allowing a stepwise intron shift; (3) cryptic
splice sites occur at NIP distances and are supported by

amino acid conservation (Figure 3A); (4) one-sided shifts
or GYRGYR/NAGNAG splice sites in some species (Figure 3B); and (5) significant sequence similarity (Materials
and Methods) between introns of both positions (Figure
3C). The last criterion is sufficient on its own to support
intron sliding and was found in 3 cases (Table 1). Here,
we observed that the intron sequence had stayed in place,
but that the splice sites seem to have been migrated.
In another 6 NIPs, at least three of the other four criteria are fulfilled. While the first two conditions are also
consistent with mechanisms of intron gain (see below),
cryptic splice sites at the corresponding distance and
one-sided shifts of intron borders in some species are
specific requirements for intron sliding (Figures 3A and
3B). Thus, the fulfillment of at least three criteria argues
for sliding also in these cases. It should be noted that only
one case of sliding (FBgn0034221) has occurred within
about 6 million years of evolution (between D. yakuba

Figure 3 Examples for intron sliding. Note that all Drosophila species have an intron in these regions and that position changes may have taken
place in two steps as the frame would have been maintained in between. (A) NIP region of the gcm2 gene (FBgn0019809). Intron sequences are
shown in lower case. The amino acid sequence consensus of the CDS is given beneath the exon sequences. The second conserved glutamine codon
between both intron positions has probably supported the shift in a common ancestor of D. pseudoobscura and D. persimilis. This conserved, potential
3' splice site is highlighted in grey. (B) NIP of the CG8516 gene (FBgn0037757). Intron sequences are shown in lower case. The amino acid sequence
consensus of the CDS is given beneath the exon sequences. GYRGYR/NAGNAG sites corresponding to the intron shift are highlighted in grey. (C) Conserved part of the intron sequences 616-1 (D. melanogaster, D. ananassae) and 615-1 (D. pseudoobscura) of the CG8516 NIP. Each intron is larger than
300 nt.

and D. melanogaster) [21] and was, therefore, expected to
show sequence conservation between both introns of the
NIP. All other putative sliding events have occurred
between Drosophila lineages that diverged at least 14 million years ago (D. ananassae and D. melanogaster). No
footprint of internal sequence conservation across the
two intron positions has been retained in any of these
cases.
In summary, 9 out of 31 NIPs most likely originated by
intron sliding. This is surprising since earlier studies concluded that intron sliding is a very rare event [13]. On the
other hand, frequent intron sliding can be expected as a

consequence of the high abundance of tandem splice sites
(GYRGYR/NAGNAG) in eukaryotic genes [22].
Detection of strong proto-splice sites in a subset of novel
introns

Donor and acceptor site consensus sequences of spliceosomal splicing also include exonic parts. At the donor
(5') splice site, the last two exonic nucleotides (typically
5'-AG-3') could bind to the U1 snRNA [23] and the corresponding nucleotide positions are essential in some
human splice sites [24,25]. In contrast, the acceptor (3')
splice site appears to be functionally independent from
exonic parts of the consensus [26]. Surprisingly, there are

"nt" means NIP distance in nucleotides. Note that each of the 9 NIPs resulting supposedly from intron sliding shows at least three of the expected properties and/or a significant sequence similarity
between introns of both positions (Materials and Methods). Introns gained by tandem duplication show a proto-splice site. In addition, a plesiomorphic intron is not identifiable because both
introns probably have been gained by the same duplication.

nucleotide preferences nevertheless, typically 5'-RT-3'
[27]. Sverdlov et al. [28] reported that younger introns
exhibit a stronger signal in the exonic part of both splice
consensus parts than older ones, while the intronic part
of the splice signal is stronger for older introns than for
younger ones. Both observations are to be expected if
novel introns sometimes originate through tandem duplications within coding exons (exon duplication). Following
such an event, a duplicated proto-splice site (consisting of
a potential intronic splice acceptor immediately followed
by a potential intronic splice donor) could turn the
sequence between both sites into an intron (Figure 1)
[29]. In Drosophila, the role of the branch site and of
additional enhancer and silencer sequences is very limited [30] and typically does not interfere with an intron
definition by donor and acceptor site alone. Thus, an
intron could immediately emerge by tandem duplication
of a proto-splice site and will have the size of the duplication.
Concomitantly, such a duplication will allow differential splice patterns (intron retentions) as a temporary or
permanent alternative to the establishment of a constitutive intron if the duplication size is a multiple of three.
Alternatively, unspliced mRNA variants may be degraded
by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) [31]. Thus, NMD
may often serve as a backup for weak splicing of such
novel introns as recently suggested by Farlow et al. [20].
The mature mRNA will remain qualitatively unchanged
during such a process. Later on, the splice signals could
be improved by selection, whereas the other parts of the
novel intronic sequence are free to change by insertions,
deletions and substitutions.
Thus, we searched for coincidences of introns and
proto-splice sites supported by amino acid conservation.
We found 9 introns in 6 NIPs that are surrounded by an
AG/GY proto-splice site. For 7 of these introns (from 5
NIPs; referred to later on as TD introns), the proto-splice
sites are conserved also in Drosophila species having no
intron there, and should thus already have been present
at the time of intron origin. The potential functionality of
these sites both as donor and acceptor sites is supported
by their splice site scores (calculated from the exonic sites
-13 to +6, Materials and Methods) that reside within the
variability of functional splice sites of D. melanogaster,
but well above the splice site scores of typical exonic
sequences surrounding Drosophila introns (Figure 4A-C,
Table 2). For two of these 7 TD introns, regional repetitiveness enhances the probability of duplications in the
CDS (FBgn0002526 and FBgn0050101). In all 18 individual sequences of TD introns we found a premature termination codon, suggesting that NMD might have played a
role during their evolution.

Identified proto-splice sites support tandem duplication
rather than reverse splicing

The concept of the proto-splice site was proposed more
than 20 years ago [32]. Despite the simplicity of the tandem duplication mechanism (also known as exon duplication), intron gain was seldom explained in this way
[19,33,34, but see 35]. Instead, proto-splice sites were
introduced as preferential insertion sites for reversespliced introns [36]. This pathway requires four successive, rate-limiting steps, namely (1) germ line transcription of the target gene; (2) reverse splicing of an occasionally retained - intron lariat into a novel site of the
target mRNA; (3) reverse transcription of this now
intron-containing mRNA; and (4) homologous recombination of this cDNA with the target gene. To our knowledge, this reverse-splicing pathway has never been shown
to have produced a spliceosomal intron.
In contrast, tandem duplications frequently occur in
natural populations. Emerson et al. [37] compared 15 natural isofemale lines of D. melanogaster and detected 1901
duplications, mostly in tandem, with a median size of 367
nt in at least one line. Irrespective of the strong evidence
for purifying selection against this type of mutations, 624
of these duplications included some exonic sequences,
but not a whole gene. Given this significant amount of
function-challenging mutations, the gain of an intron
may compensate for a duplication simply if a proto-splice
site is included.
In order to further support the hypothesis that the 7
TD introns arose by tandem duplication rather than by
reverse splicing, we evaluated their proto-splice sites. If
splice sites had emerged directly by duplication of protosplice sites, (1) proto-splice and splice sites should be
similar to each other and (2) both should be functional
splice sites. If intronic splice sites stemmed from a
reverse-spliced intron, proto-splice sites would not need
to be similar to splice sites but should have provided a
preferential binding site for the spliceosome that has
inserted the intron. The sequence specificity of spliceosome-binding during forward splicing is mediated by
the binding of the U1 snRNP to the donor site [23]. However, the initial interactions of a spliceosome capable of
reverse splicing are unknown. Thus, alternatively, the U5
snRNP complex maybe binds first because this complex
interacts during the second splicing reaction with both
exon ends to ligate them [38]. For U5 snRNP, known
sequence preferences are weak and not consistent with
proto-splice sites [39]. Other sequence-specific binding
components of the spliceosome such as the U2, U4 and
U6 snRNPs exclusively interact with the intron. Reverse
splicing, therefore, might have produced proto-splice
sites that remember donor sites (nts -2 to +6: AG/
GYRAGT) or no proto-splice sites at all. Specifically, the

Figure 4 Scores of proto-splice sites. The distributions of splice site scores are shown separately for donor, acceptor, and the sum of donor and acceptor sites, displaying different sets of sites: (RS) 16766 reference splice sites of D. melanogaster, (TD) the 18 proto-splice sites from 7 apomorphic NIP
introns potentially arised by tandem duplications, (ON) the 236 proto-splice sites from all other NIP introns, (RP) 16506 potential proto-splice sites corresponding to the reference introns, and (IS) 52626 exonic AGGY motif surroundings which are located more than 31 nt apart from exon boundaries.
(A-C) Results that refer to complete splice consensus sites. TD proto-splice sites are potentially functional splice sites as (1) they are within the range
of functional splice site scores of the reference set (RS), and (2) they reside within the top range of proto-splice site scores of the intron reference set
(RP). (D-F) Scores determined as in (A-C) that refer to a partial splice consensus excluding the motif AG/GY. (G) Identical nts between the donor and
acceptor sites of each intron excluding the motif AG/GY. 15 nts (-13 to -3 and +3 to +6 in relation to start and end of each intron, respectively) were
compared between both sites. Given no similarity between both sites, 3.75 identical nt positions would be expected at random.

To distinguish between the two alternative pathways,
we evaluated the splice sites, the proto-splice sites and
the relative location of the new introns in more detail:
(1) We determined scores for reference splice sites and
proto-splice sites excluding the central AG/GY motif.
These scores are based on the nts +3 to +6 (donor site)

and the nts -13 to -3 (acceptor site). We found that such
partial proto-splice acceptor sites of TD introns show
intermediate scores between reference splice sites (RS) on
the one hand, and potential proto-splice sites surrounding reference introns (RP) and intron-less AGGY protosplice site motifs of exons (IS) (Figure 4E) on the other
hand. Moreover, the partial proto-splice acceptor site
scores of the TD introns are statistically significantly dif-

splicing, the acceptor-binding parts of the spliceosome
are occupied by intronic sequences, thus, these parts cannot be involved in target site selection in case of reverse

Figure 6 An example for exon duplication. Shown is the NIP region of the CG8105 gene (FBgn0030661). Intron sequences are shown in lower case.
The amino acid sequence consensus of the CDS is given beneath the exon sequences. While intron 211-0 of D. ananassae has probably risen by exon
duplication, the mechanism of origination of intron 214-1 (D. willistoni) remained unknown. Note that the 5' part of the proto-splice site in position
211-0 (highlighted in grey) strongly varies between the species. No other insect species has an intron within this region of the CDS, so both introns
are considered novel.

NIP number

(2) If the supposedly duplicated sequences of both
intron/exon borders of one intron are compared under
exclusion of the central AG/GY motif, these regions of
TD introns are significantly more similar to each other
compared to other NIP introns (ON) or reference introns
(RS/RP) (Welch two-sample t-tests, p = 0.001426 and p =
0.000798, respectively; Figure 4G). This finding is based
on the same data as the first one but they were used here
in a slightly different way. This result argues in favour of
tandem duplication.
(3) The location of the TD introns within the genes
does not support an origin by reverse splicing. A reversetranscription mediated pathway would imply a 3' biased
distribution of novel introns as the reverse transcriptase
should start primarily at the 3' end of the mRNA [40].
Apomorphic NIP introns, however, show a biased location in favour of the 5' and, to a lesser extent, 3' ends of
the genes (Figure 5). Whereas the average locations of
apomorphic introns of the TD and ON sets across the 10
bins were not significantly different (p = 0.431; two-sided,
Welch two sample t-test), there is a moderate significance
(p = 0.035; one-sided, binomial test; 5' -region: bins 1 to 5,
3' -region: bins 6 to 10) to reject the null hypothesis that
the 31 novel introns (of both sets ON and TD) are equally
distributed between the 5' -region and the 3' -region. This
is more consistent with an origin by tandem duplication,
which is indifferent to location, than by reverse splicing.
The above suggested cases of exon duplications are not
supported by sequence conservation of (surrounding)
exonic and unconstrained intronic sequences. This could

be due to the relatively large evolutionary age of all cases
of exon duplications reported here. The youngest intron
that may have originated by duplication has evolved in
the D. melanogaster lineage after divergence from the D.
erecta lineage and thus appears to be between 5 and 10
million years old (FBgn0002526, 1460-0). Accordingly,
the footprint of duplication might have been lost.
It has to be noted that intron gain by exon duplication
typically cannot be detected using the NIP approach
because in most cases an ancient intron will not be present. Thus, tandem duplication may be a more common
mechanism of intron gain than suggested by our specifically selected data [19]. However, two different intron
positions may arise in one duplicated region if two protosplice sites are included. In this case, the intron gains are
not independent. This may have occurred in
FBgn0038300 (introns 44-0 and 54-0) and in
FBgn0029747 (introns 200-0 and 207-0) before the divergence of the subgenera Drosophila and Sophophora.
Alternatively, there might have been an ancient intron
that was lost before the duplication (FBgn0050101). In
the remaining two cases, the other intron seems to be
novel, too, but has emerged in another lineage by an
unknown mechanism (FBgn0030661 and FBgn0002526,
Figure 6).

Conclusions
During our study of novel intron positions in evolutionarily conserved genes of Drosophila we confirmed that
near intron pairs (NIPs) are reliable phylogenetic mark-

ers. Furthermore, our results support that intron sliding
(migration) is one of the causes of recently emerged
intron positions within conserved protein-coding Drosophila genes. We also found evidence for the rise of novel
introns by tandem duplication of exonic DNA. The origin
for 17 out of 31 identified NIPs remains unknown (Figure
7). Contrary to expectations, the gain of novel introns by
other mechanisms could not be proved, for example, by
insertion of a spliceosomal intron via reverse splicing into
a new position, by insertion of a transposable element or
by gene conversion with an intron-containing paralog.
Recent origins of spliceosomal introns in eukaryotic
genes, therefore, often might be local mutations (Drosophila) or insertions of alien sequences (Daphnia) [14], but
not insertions of reverse-transcribed sequences. This is
supported by a recent analysis of intron gain through
intronization in Caenorhabditis [3] and should be evaluated also for other eukaryotes.

Methods
Compilation of the data set

We started with 12386 sets of 1:1 orthologous protein
coding genes extracted from FlyBase and the "FlyBase
melanogaster gene ortholog report" (release FB2009_01)
[41]. For each set, we obtained the available gene
sequences (genomic DNA) as well as their translations
(protein sequences). We run a NIP extraction alignment
procedure as described in more detail in the following,
which aims at identifying orthologous and nearby intron
positions within the data set.
Multiple codon alignment and subsequent extraction of
NIP region candidates

CDS were compiled according to the FlyBase peptide
annotations and aligned at the protein level. The translated multiple alignments (codon alignments) were performed using a slightly modified version of the
TransAlign utility [42]. Our modifications included the
usage of Muscle [43] for protein alignment and subsequent use of the realignment tool of Csurös et al. [44] to
optimize the recognition of conserved intron positions.
The other parameters used for the TransAlign utility
ensured the exclusion of sequences where stop codons
occurred within the CDS.
By mapping the various intron positions onto the multiple translated alignment, orthologous and nearby intron
positions become apparent. In cases where several translations (isoforms) for the reference species (D. melanogaster) are available, the annotation and reference protein
were selected according to highest sequence similarity to
all other species' translations. Intron positions within the
multiple alignments were named according to their absolute positions within the Dme reference peptide sequence
by using translated BLAT [45]. In a last step, only those

Page 13 of 15

intervals were extracted from each alignment where at
least two intron positions were included while separated
by less than 50 nt. Regions hereby were extracted including 30 nt flanking alignment sequence around the
regions' outmost intron positions.
Filter steps to remove low confidence and erroneous NIP
candidates

We obtained 4044 putative NIP regions each containing
at least two intron positions. We excluded NIPs from this
set that contained genes with both introns of a pair and
such which failed to show the splice rule consensus for
both donor (GYR) and acceptor (HAG). In addition, we
required at least 6 non-gap characters at both exon borders. This resulted in 959 candidate NIP regions, which
we ordered according to a conservation score collected
from the most similar pair of amino acid sequences representing different intron positions of the local multiple
alignment. The conservation score was calculated as the
average of relative sum-of-pair scores utilizing the
BLOSUM45 substitution matrix of Clustal W [46]. By
requiring a minimal conservation score of 0.75, we
reduced the candidate list to 138 potential NIP regions.
To enrich the candidates with information on available
EST data, we performed an automated search for ESTs
overlapping occupied intron positions out of these candidates for each species (NCBI-BLAST-2.2.19+ against
NCBI est_others database). Furthermore, we used Drosophila splice site matrices [27] and a weighted score cutoff
of 50 to remove sequences and consequently NIPs by
detecting obviously falsely annotated intron positions.
The computational filtering concluded with 122 NIP
regions that were then inspected manually for validity,
resulting in 36 NIPs. During this last step, we also
required the valid NIP distance to be less than 32 nt (initially < 50 nt), to obtain a more reliable data set, based on
a comparison of the abundances of short exons and NIP
distances (data not shown) within Drosophila. The manual analysis included the search for orthologous outgroup
sequences to infer the plesiomorphic and apomorphic
intron positions where possible. Additionally, 2 Drosophila sequences were manually added to the alignments
(e.g. Dmo to FBgn0002526), 8 sequences were removed
(e.g. Dgr from FBgn0015572), and one obvious misannotation/sequence error could be corrected (Der in
FBgn0046689) (see also comments in Additional file 1).
PCR analysis

We performed PCR to confirm the intron positions of 7
NIPs that were only weakly supported. For this purpose,
we isolated female whole body RNA and genomic DNA
from adults of the appropriate Drosophila species. In case
of Drosophila sechellia, D. willistoni and D. persimilis, we
used the strains (UC Drosophila Species Stock Center,

San Diego, California) that were originally used for whole
genome sequencing [18]. The total RNA was subsequently converted to cDNA (primed with Oligo dT) with
the RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Fermentas). The primers used for PCR are given in
Additional file 3. The resulting PCR products were
extracted from agarose gels (Invisorb Spin DNA Extraction Kit, Invitek) and directly sequenced using Big Dye
sequencing chemistry (ABI). For sequence analysis, Mac
Vector version 7.2 was used.
Construction of an intron pair distribution matrix

From the 31 remaining NIPs, an intron pair matrix was
manually created and analyzed in MacClade 4.0 [47]
(Additional file 4). Within the intron pair matrix, the
upstream intron is coded as "1", and the downstream
intron as "2" or "3" whereas intron less pair positions and
no data are coded as "?". Intron data from the insect outgroup species were combined into an "outgroup" row.
Novel intron sequence analysis

The intron sequences of all 31 final NIPs were compared
by BLAST with introns and exons of the corresponding
orthologous genes, to identify any similarities. Furthermore, Drosophila and Wolbachia genomic sequences,
repetitive sequences [48] and the complete GenBank
database (wgs/nr) were used as targets in BLAST analysis. By requiring a nearly complete coverage (max 5 nt
unmatched positions at both ends) of the intron query
sequence within the target sequences, and a standard Evalue cutoff of 0.0001, the BLAST results were filtered on
significant hits for probable sources of intron sequences.
Additionally, RNAz [49] was used to screen for potentially conserved (thermodynamically stable) secondary
structures within each set of aligned (positional orthologous) intron sequences (Clustal W, Muscle).

positions after the intron) and 13 intronic and 1 exonic
positions of the acceptor site (proto-splice site: 13 positions before and 1 position after the intron). The percentiles of these scores among the reference scores RS and
RP were collected (Table 2).

Reference data sets and splice site scores

Reference data sets of splice sites were compiled to compare the splice site strengths of potential proto-splice
sites. The reference set of in total 16766 splice sites (RS)
was created from introns of all transcripts of D. melanogaster with a maximal evidence of expression (15 points)
[41]. A second reference set of potential proto-splice sites
consisting of all exonic sequences immediately surrounding these introns (RP) was created. As a third reference
set (IS), all exonic sequences (from the D. melanogaster
transcripts) were sampled that contain the AGGY protosplice site motif and whose potential intron positions
would be located more than 31 nt from the exon borders.
Position weight matrices (PWMs) for splice site scoring
were generated from the reference splice sites (RS). For
each (proto-) splice site the score was calculated according to [27], i.e. using 3 exonic and 6 intronic positions of
the donor site (proto-splice site: 3 positions before and 6
