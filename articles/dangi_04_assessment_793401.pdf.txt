Abstract
Background: Various species of genus Trigonella are important from medical and culinary aspect.
Among these, Trigonella foenum-graecum is commonly grown as a vegetable. This anti-diabetic herb
can lower blood glucose and cholesterol levels. Another species, Trigonella caerulea is used as food
in the form of young seedlings. This herb is also used in cheese making. However, little is known
about the genetic variation present in these species. In this report we describe the use of ISSR and
RAPD markers to study genetic diversity in both, Trigonella foenum-graecum and Trigonella caerulea.
Results: Seventeen accessions of Trigonella foenum-graecum and nine accessions of Trigonella
caerulea representing various countries were analyzed using ISSR and RAPD markers. Genetic
diversity parameters (average number of alleles per polymorphic locus, percent polymorphism,
average heterozygosity and marker index) were calculated for ISSR, RAPD and ISSR+RAPD
approaches in both the species. Dendrograms were constructed using UPGMA algorithm based on
the similarity index values for both Trigonella foenum-graecum and Trigonella caerulea. The UPGMA
analysis showed that plants from different geographical regions were distributed in different groups
in both the species. In Trigonella foenum-graecum accessions from Pakistan and Afghanistan were
grouped together in one cluster but accessions from India and Nepal were grouped together in
another cluster. However, in both the species accessions from Turkey did not group together and
fell in different clusters.
Conclusions: Based on genetic similarity indices, higher diversity was observed in Trigonella
caerulea as compared to Trigonella foenum-graecum. The genetic similarity matrices generated by
ISSR and RAPD markers in both species were highly correlated (r = 0.78 at p = 0.001 for Trigonella
foenum-graecum and r = 0.98 at p = 0.001 for Trigonella caerulea) indicating congruence between
these two systems. Implications of these observations in the analysis of genetic diversity and in
supporting the possible Center of Origin and/or Diversity for Trigonella are discussed.

Background
The family Fabaceae includes many crops useful for food,
forage, fiber, wood and ornamental purposes. In this family, a few legumes such as chickpea, soybean, fababean,
fenugreek, lentil, pea etc. are consumed as grain legumes.
The grain legumes are plants used as food in the form of
unripe pods, mature seeds or immature dry seeds, directly
or indirectly [1]. The grain legumes not only provide variety to human diet but they also supply dietary proteins for
vegetarian populations that lack animal and fish protein
in their diet. Considering the growing problem of malnutrition, use of legume species as high-protein food is very
important. Moreover, legumes are also capable of symbiotic nitrogen fixation enriching the soil condition suitable
for a crop following the legume crop [2].
The genus Trigonella is one of the largest genera of the tribe
Trifoliatae in the family Fabaceae and sub-family Papilionaceae [3]. Among Trigonella species, Trigonella foenumgraecum (commonly known as fenugreek) is a flowering
annual, with autogamous white flowers occasionally visited by insects. Indigenous to countries on the eastern
shores of Mediterranean, fenugreek is widely cultivated in
India, Egypt, Ethiopia, Morocco and occasionally in England [4]. Trigonella foenum-graecum is extensively grown in
the tropical and subtropical regions of India. Different
parts of the plant such as leaves and seeds are consumed
in India. It is also used for medicinal purpose. According
to ancient medicinal system, the Ayurveda, it is a herbal
drugs that is bitter or pungent in taste. It is effective against
anorexia and is a gastric stimulant [5]. Fenugreek is
becoming popular around the world with its extract used
to flavor cheese in Switzerland, artificial maple syrup and
bitter-run in Germany, roasted seeds as coffee-substitute
in Africa, seed powder mixed with flour as fortification to
make flat-bread in Egypt, as an anti-diabetic herb in Israel,
whole seed and dried plant used as insect and pest repellent in grain storage, and oil used in perfumery in France
[6]. Research reports in recent years have indicated that
fenugreek can be a remedy to diabetes by lowering blood
sugar and cholesterol levels [7].
T. caerulae, from the same family and commonly known
as the Blue fenugreek, on the other hand, is a less commonly grown herb. This flowering annual with autogamous blue flower is found in Alps and in the mountains
of eastern and south eastern Europe. Terminal leaves are
mainly used for cooking while young seedlings are eaten
with oil and salt. Dried and powdered leaves as well as
flowers are used for flavoring and coloring bread, cheese,
etc in China and Germany. They are also used as a condiment in soups and potato dishes and a decoction of leaves
is used as aromatic tea [8].

Grain legumes like T. foenum-graecum and T. caerulea
although important in food and medicine are rarely
grown outside their native habitat. Across the world only
known and well-defined cultivars are grown in specific
areas. Gene banks also harbor scanty germplasm collection of Trigonella species [9]. The neglected and the underuse status of these locally important crops indicates a risk
of disappearance of important plant material developed
over thousands of years of cultivation. One of the important factors restricting their large-scale production and
development of better varieties is that very little information is available about their genetic diversity, inter and
intraspecific variability and genetic relationship among
these species. Therefore, attempts to analyze possible
untapped genetic diversity become extremely essential for
breeding and crop improvement. The present study was
undertaken with the objective of analyzing genetic diversity in various accessions of T. foenum-graecum and T. caerulea representing various countries where they are grown
using molecular marker technology.

Results
Assessment of genetic diversity in T. foenum-graecum
and T. caerulea using ISSR and RAPD markers
A set of 100 ISSR primers was used for initial screening of
7 accessions of T. foenum-graecum of which 40 gave amplification. However, only 14 ISSR primers detected intraspecific variation in I7 accessions of T. foenum-graecum
generating clear reproducible patterns and revealing 100
bands in the range of 500 bp to 2 kb. Among these seventy-two bands were polymorphic amounting to 72%
polymorphism [Table 3]. Furthermore, during ISSR analysis 11 unique bands were obtained, where 6 were contributed by accession TMP = 8714 from Yemen, 4 by
accession TMP = 8691 from Turkey, and 1 by accession
TMP = 8685 from Iran. Similarly, in T. caerulea, of the 100
ISSR primers used for initial screening, 47 gave amplification. Of these, 18 primers detected intraspecific variation
in 9 accessions of T. caerulea showing 93.64% polymorphism [Table 4]. With these 18 primers, 16 unique bands
were produced, where 9 and 7 bands were contributed by
accessions 206901 and 206486, respectively, from Turkey
alone.

In case of RAPD analysis, 100 RAPD primers were used for
initial screening in T. foenum-graecum of which 22 primers
generated polymorphic patterns revealing 70.12% polymorphism [Table 3]. Eight unique bands were produced
by these primers of which 3 were contributed by accession
TMP = 8714 from Yemen, 2 by accession TMP = 8698
from Egypt, 1 by accession TMP = 8707 from Afghanistan
and 1 each by accession TMP = 8691 and TMP = 8690
from Turkey. Similarly in T. caerulea of the 40 primers
used for initial screening, 10 primers produced polymorphic pattern giving 95.83% polymorphism [Table 4].

Eight unique bands were produced with these primers
wherein; the maximum numbers of unique bands (4
each) were again produced by the same accessions
206901 and 206486 from Turkey.
Dendrogram analysis for T. foenum-graecum and T.
caerulea
Genetic similarity was calculated from the Nei's similarity
index value for all the 17 accessions of T. foenum-graecum
considering ISSR and RAPD approaches individually as
well as together. Based on ISSR markers alone, the similarity index values ranged from 0.69 to 0.92. These values
were used to construct a dendrogram using Unweighted
Pair Group Method with Arithmetic averages (UPGMA).
In the ISSR based dendrogram T. foenum-graecum genotypes formed 4 clusters [Figure not shown]. The first cluster grouped together accessions from Afghanistan (8707),
Canada (1065), Pakistan (8717,8718), Iran (8675), and
Turkey (8690). The second cluster contained accessions
from India (8686,8689,8675). Remaining one accession
from India (8687) and one from Nepal (8706) formed
the third cluster. The fourth cluster contained accessions
from Egypt (8698,8679) and Turkey (8692). Accessions
from Ethiopia (8696), Turkey (8691) and Yemen (8714)
out grouped from the main clusters. Three accessions
from Turkey analyzed in the present study fell into different clusters.

Based on RAPD markers alone, the similarity index values
ranged from 0.71 to 0.91. In the RAPD based dendrogram, T. foenum-graecum genotypes formed 2 main clusters [Figure not shown]. The first cluster had two
subgroups, the first subgroup contained accessions from

Afghanistan (8707), India (8686,8687,8675), Turkey
(8690) and Egypt (8698) while the second subgroup contained accessions from Pakistan (8717,8718), Turkey
(8692), and Egypt (8679). The accession from Canada
associated with these clusters. The second cluster contained accession from Iran (8685) and Nepal (8706) and
the accession from India associated with this cluster.
Accessions from Ethiopia (8696), Turkey (8691) and
Yemen (8714) out grouped from these two clusters. In the
RAPD based dendrogram also accessions from Turkey fell
into different clusters.
Based on both the marker systems together the similarity
index values ranged from 0.65 to 0.89 [Fig. 1]. Here the T.
foenum-graecum accessions from Egypt (8698,8679) were
grouped together. Accessions from Pakistan (8717, 8718)
and Afghanistan (8707) were grouped together in one
cluster. Accessions from India (8686,8689,8675,8687),
Nepal (8706) and Iran (8685) were grouped together.
However, all the three accessions from Turkey fell in different clusters and did not group among themselves.
Bootstrapping was done using the WinBoot program to
estimate the relative support at clades. The robustness of
the cluster was not very strong in T. foenum-graecum (50–
70%).
In T. caerulea, genetic similarity was calculated from the
Nei's similarity index value considering ISSR and RAPD
approaches individually as well as together. Based on ISSR
marker system, the similarity index values ranged from
0.41 to 0.92 while that on the basis of RAPD markers
ranged from 0.34 to 0.93. Similarity indices values based
on both the marker systems together ranged from 0.38 to

0.92 indicating more diversity in case of T. caerulea. The
dendrograms based on ISSR and RAPD markers showed
similar clustering pattern when used individually [Figures
not shown] as well as together [Fig. 2]. Here the dendrogram showed two main clusters. The first cluster grouped
together accessions form Turkey (TMP = 8704) and Australia (PI = 186283). The second cluster contained 3 accessions of unknown geographic origin and 1 accession each
from U.S.A (PI = 345743) and Spain (PI = 244288). The
remaining 2 accessions i.e. accessions PI = 206486 and PI
= 206901 from Turkey, out grouped from these two main
clusters. Thus the accessions from Turkey did not cluster
together as observed in T. foenum-graecum. The bootstrap
values obtained using the WinBoot program in T. caerulea
were very high (90–100%).

using molecular markers were available in the genus Trigonella. In the present study, an attempt has been made to
examine the level of genetic variation within T. foenumgraecum and T. caerulea accessions obtained from germplasm collection centers at Saskatoon (Plant Gene
Resources of Canada) and Pullman (USDA-ARS Plant
Introduction Station, Washington). The T. foenum-graecum accessions were selected in order to represent most of
the countries where it is grown. In case of T. caerulea all
the nine accessions available at Saskatoon and Pullman
were used in present study.

Discussion

Analysis of polymorphism detected in T. foenumgraecum and T. caerulea
Polymorphism in a given population is often due to existence of genetic variants represented by the number of alleles at a locus and their frequency of distribution in a
population. Heterozygosity corresponds to a probability
that two alleles taken at random from a population can be
distinguished using the marker in question. Thus a convenient quantitative estimate of marker utility and the
polymorphism detected can be given in terms of the mean
heterozygosity and the marker index [18]. In T. foenumgraecum as well as in T. caerulea the Hav and the marker
index (MI) values for ISSR and RAPD markers [Table 3
and 4], respectively, did not differ significantly indicating
that similar levels of polymorphism were detected by both
the marker systems in the given germplasm pools. This
was also confirmed by the high correlation co-efficent for
ISSR and RAPD marker systems obtained for T. foenumgraecum and T. caerulea [Fig. 3 and 4]. Genetic diversity as
measured by the heterozygosity was higher in T. caerulea
(0.33) as compared to T. foenum-graecum (0.21). Based on
allozyme diversity, the estimated mean heterozygosity
values have been reported for self-pollinating species,
Vigna unguiculata, Hav = 0.027 [19] and Vicia tetrasperma,
Hav = 0.342 [20]. The heterozygosity value for Vigna
unguiculata was lower while that for Vicia tetrasperma was
higher as compared to T. foenum-graecum and T. caerulea.
Based on ISSR markers, the estimates of genetic diversity,
Hav = 0.358 reported in cultivated pawpaw (Asimia
triloba), was higher as compared to T. foenum-graecum and
T. caerulea [13].

The two marker systems, ISSR and RAPD used in the
present study have also been used as effective tools to
evaluate genetic diversity and to throw light on the phylogenetic relationships in Brassica napi [rapeseed, [10]],
Allium sect. Sacculiferum [Alliaceae, [11]] and Asimina triloba [pawpaw, [12] and [13]]. Genetic diversity analysis
using ISSR and RAPD markers in legumes like Cicer [[14]
and [15]] and Cajanus [[17] and [18]] has been carried out
in our own laboratory. These studies have given important clues in understanding species relationship, which
may further assist in developing and planning breeding
strategies. However, no such reports on genetic diversity

Estimation of genetic relatedness in T. foenum-graecum
and T. caerulea
Data collected with ISSR and RAPD marker systems were
used to compare genetic similarity between various accessions of T. foenum-graecum and T. caerulea. The accessions
could be a mixture of different genotypes. Therefore, to
have a complete representation of a specific accession,
DNAs from fifteen plants were mixed in equal proportion.
Thus within accession diversity was eliminated and a
complete banding profile of the accession was used for the
analysis.

Heterozygosity and marker index
Heterozygosity was calculated using ISSR and RAPD
marker systems individually as well as together as detailed
in Table 3 for T. foenum-graecum and in Table 4 for T. caerulea. In T. foenum-graecum the Hav values calculated for
ISSR, RAPD and ISSR+RAPD were 0.214, 0.203 and 0.211,
respectively. In case of T. caerulea the Hav values for the
same were 0.330, 0.346 and 0.338, respectively. For both,
T. foenum-graecum and T. caerulea, the Hav values for ISSR
and RAPD systems did not differ significantly. The marker
index (MI) values calculated for ISSR and RAPD for T. foenum-graecum were 1.53 and 1.51, respectively while in T.
caerulea they were 3.17 and 3.35, respectively. Thus MI
values in both the species did not differ significantly for
ISSR and RAPD systems.
Correlation between measures of similarity
In T. foenum-graecum, when the similarity matrices generated using ISSR and RAPD markers were compared, a
value of r = 0.78, at P = 0.001 indicated a good correlation
between data generated by both the systems [Fig. 3]. Similarly when the similarity matrices generated using ISSR
and RAPD systems were compared in case of T. caerulea, a
value of r = 0.98 indicated a very good correlation
between the two marker systems [Fig. 4].

In T. foenum-graecum, ISSR and RAPD could detect almost
similar level of polymorphism (72% with ISSR and
70.12% with RAPD). In the UPGMA analysis, T. foenumgraecum accessions from one country and the nearby
region grouped together in some cases while they were
placed in different clusters in certain cases. Accessions
from Pakistan and Afghanistan grouped together in one
cluster while accessions from India and Nepal grouped in
another cluster. Moreover, the three accessions from Turkey fell in different clusters inspite of being geographically
very close to each other. Thus, there was no clear
clustering pattern of geographically closer accessions in
the present study indicating that the association between
genetic similarity and geographical distance was less significant. However, it is necessary to use more number of
accessions from each geographical location to confirm the
available pattern.

In T. caerulea also, ISSR (93.64%) and RAPDs (94.83%)
detected almost equal level of polymorphism. T. caerulea
showed more polymorphism as compared to T. foenumgraecum. In case of T. caerulea also, the UPGMA analysis
showed that plants from different geographical regions
were distributed in different groups. Here again, the accessions from Turkey were not grouped together. Two accessions from Turkey out grouped from the main cluster
while one was grouped in the first cluster with Australia.
In T. caerulea we could obtain three accessions from Turkey and only one accession from other countries. Therefore, it would be premature to comment precisely about
the correlation of geographic distance and genetic diversity in this case. To confirm the available pattern it is necessary to use more number of accessions from each
geographical location.

Center of Origin and /or Center of Diversity for Trigonella
The place of origin of a species as explained by Vavilov is
an area that contains a large amount of genetic variability
of that species. According to him variation is a function of
time, hence the region containing the greatest variation in
a species would have supported and sustained that species
for a longer time than the other regions suggesting that
region to be the Center of Origin and/or Diversity. He set
up eight geographic centers, two of which namely the
Near Eastern and Mediterranean Centers extent into Turkey [21].

It has been postulated by Vavilov that the Near East region
extending from Israel through Syria, Southern Turkey into
Iran and Iraq and the Mediterranean Center including
Spain, Morocco and Turkey is the Center of Origin of Trigonella, Trifolium and Medicago species [22]. In the present
study both, T. foenum-graecum and T. caerulea accessions

from Turkey exhibited more diversity. These results support Vavilov's hypothesis. The Indian accessions of T. foenum-graecum i.e. accession number 8686 (Khandwa),
8685(Mumbai), and 8687 (Patiala) separated by an aerial
distance of 52 km, 104 km, and 135 km, respectively from
each other, were genetically more similar (similarity index
0.893) and clustered together [Fig. 1]. However, the accessions of T. foenum-graecum from Turkey i.e. accession
number 8692 (Malatya) and 8691 (Elbistan) separated by
a distance of 100 km (similarity index value 0.875-0.745)
were out grouped and were genetically more distant from
each other although morphologically they were similar to
each other as well to the accessions from other countries.
Turkey is one of the significant and unique countries in
the world from the point of view of plant genetic resources
and plant diversity. The country has more than 3,000
endemic plants and immense diversity has been reported

in many legumes such as Vicia, Medicago, Trifolium, Lathyrus, Onbrychis, Trigonella, Pisum, Cicer, Lens, etc [23]. Many
genera of cultivated plants like Cicer, Lens, Pisum, Amygladus, Prunus, Triticum, etc have their Center of Origin
and/or Diversity in this country [22]. Vavilov designated
southeastern Turkey and the adjoining Syria as the primary Center of Origin (now the center of diversity) for
chickpea [24]. Similar to chickpea (and other grain legumes also), in T. foenum-graecum the large seeded cultivars
are abounded around the Mediterranean region whereas
the small seeded cultivars are predominated eastwards.
Thus, Turkey may also be the primary Center of Origin of
T. foenum-graecum and T. caerulea. However, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed by considering more accessions distributed over a wide geographic range especially
from the Near East and the Central Mediterranean region.

Conclusions
In conclusion, molecular markers allowed us to estimate
the overall genetic diversity in T. foenum-graecum and T.
caerulea and simultaneously revealed molecular based
genetic relationship. In the UPGMA analysis, no significant correlation was observed between geographic distance and genetic diversity. Our data further supported the
hypothesis of the Near East and the Central Mediterranean to be the Center of Origin and/or Diversity for Trigonella as put forth by Vavilov.

Methods
Plant material and DNA extraction
Seeds of T. foenum-graecum accessions were obtained
from Plant Gene Resources of Canada (PGRC), Saskatoon, Canada. These accessions along with the TMP numbers and the country from where they have been collected
are outlined in Table 1. Seeds for various T. caerulea accessions were obtained from PGRC, Saskatoon, Canada and
USDA-ARS Plant Introduction Station at Pullman, Washington (W-6), and are detailed in Table 2. Fifteen plants of
each accession were grown in pots for DNA isolation. Two
gram of young leaf tissue was harvested for each plant and
frozen in liquid nitrogen for DNA extraction. Plant DNA
was extracted by the Doyle and Doyle method [25] and
equal amount of DNA from each of the fifteen plants was
pooled together for each accession.
PCR amplification
ISSR
A set of 100 anchored micro satellite primers was procured from University of British Columbia, Canada. PCR
amplification of 20 ng of DNA was performed in 10 mM
Tris-HCI pH 7.5, 50 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM
spermidine, 2% formamide, 0.1 mM dNTPs, 0.3 uM

turation at 94°C for 5 minutes, each cycle consisted of 30
seconds denaturation at 94°C, 45 seconds of annealing at
50°C, 2 minutes extension at 72°C along with 5 minutes
extension at 72°C at the end of 45 cycles.
RAPD
RAPD analysis was performed using arbitary decamer
primers procured from University of British Columbia,
Canada. The reaction mixture (25 ul) contained 10 mM
Tris-HCI pH 7.5, 50 mM KCI, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM
spermidine, 0.1 mM dNTPs, 15 pmoles of primer, 20 ng
genomic DNA, and 0.8 U of Taq DNA polymerase (AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, Perkin Elmer, USA). Amplification
was carried out using Perkin Elmer 9700 thermocycle for
40 cycles, each consisting of a denaturing step of 1 minute
at 94°C, followed by annealing step of 1 minute at 36°C
and an extension step of 2 minutes at 72°C. The last cycle
was followed by 5 minutes of extension at 72°C. Amplified products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gel
using 0.5× TAE buffer (10 mM Tris HCl and 1 mM EDTA
pH. 8.0) and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
The patterns were photographed and stored as digital pictures in gel documentation system. The reproducibility of
the amplification was confirmed by repeating each experiment three times.

ducibility of the amplification was confirmed by repeating
each experiment three times.
Data analysis
Unequivocally reproducible bands were scored and
entered into a binary character matrix (1 for presence and
0 for absence). The genetic similarity among accessions
was determined by Nei’s genetic distance [26]. A dendrogram was constructed based on the matrix of distance
using Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic
averages. Scores entered in matrix were analyzed using
TAXAN version 4.0 software based on the degree of bands
sharing. Similarity matrix was generated using Dice coefficient as SI = 2Nab/Na+Nb where Na = total number of
bands present in lane a, Nb = total of bands in lane b, Nab
number of bands common to lanes a and b [27]. The dice
values were then used to perform the UPGMA analysis. To
evaluate the robustness of the grouping formed the binary
data matrix was subjected to bootstrapping using WinBoot program [28]. The phenogram was reconstructed
1000 times by repeating sampling with replacement and
the frequency with which the groups were formed was
used to indicate the strength of the group. Correlation coefficient for the similarity matrices generated by ISSR and
RAPD data in both, T.foenum-graecum and T.caerulea,
were calculated by method of Smouse et al [29]. The
expected heterozygosity, Hn for a genetic marker was calculated as: Hn = 1 - pi2, where pi is the allele frequency of
the ith allele [26]. The arithmetic mean heterozygosity
Hav for each marker class was calculated as Hav = Hn/n,
where n = number of markers or loci analyzed [18]. The
average heterozygosity for polymorphic marker (Hav)p
was further derived as; (Hav)p = Hn/np; where np is the
no. of polymorphic markers or loci [18]. Marker index
(Ml) for each marker system was also calculated as, MI =
E (Hav)p; where E = effective multiplex ratio [E = nβ
where β is the fraction of polymorphic marker or loci,18].
