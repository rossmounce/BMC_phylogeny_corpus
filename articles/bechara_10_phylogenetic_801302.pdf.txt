Abstract
Background: The genus Arachis comprises 80 species and it is subdivided into nine taxonomic sections (Arachis,
Caulorrhizae, Erectoides, Extranervosae, Heteranthae, Procumbentes, Rhizomatosae, Trierectoides, and Triseminatae). This
genus is naturally confined to South America and most of its species are native to Brazil. In order to provide a
better understanding of the evolution of the genus, we reconstructed the phylogeny of 45 species using the
variation observed on nucleotide sequences in internal transcribed spacer regions (ITS1 and ITS2) and 5.8 S of
nuclear ribosomal DNA.
Results: Intraspecific variation was detected, but in general it was not enough to place accessions of the same
species in different clades. Our data support the view that Arachis is a monophyletic group and suggested
Heteranthae as the most primitive section of genus Arachis. The results confirmed the circumscriptions of some
sections (Caulorrhizae, Extranervosae), but raised questions about others. Sections Erectoides, Trierectoides and
Procumbentes were not well defined, while sections Arachis and Rhizomatosae seem to include species that could
be moved to different sections. The division of section Arachis into A and B genome species was also observed in
the phylogenetic tree and these two groups of species may not have a monophyletic origin. The 2n = 2x = 18
species of section Arachis (A. praecox, A. palustris and A. decora) were all placed in the same clade, indicating they
are closely related to each other, and their genomes are more related to B genome than to the A genome. Data
also allowed insights on the origin of tetraploid A. glabrata, suggesting rhizome appeared twice within the genus
and raising questions about the placement of that species in section Rhizomatosae.
Conclusion: The main clades established in this study in general agreed with many other studies that have used
other types of evidences and sets of species, being some of them included in our study and some not. Thus, the
relationships established can be a useful framework for future systematic reviews of genus Arachis and for the
selection of species to pre-breeding programs.

Background
The genus Arachis originated in South America, where
all the cultivated and wild species are found, and
includes 80 described species [1,2]. Groundnut, the allotetraploid species A. hypogaea (genome formula AABB),
is the most important species of the genus because it is
cultivated as an oilseed crop and as a direct source of
human food. The genus also includes species such as A.
glabrata (section Rhizomatosae) and A. pintoi (section

Caulorrhizae), which are frequently used in cultivated
pastures.
Many studies have focused on the taxonomy of genus
Arachis (Table 1). The first published classification
divided the genus into six sections, some of which were
sub-divided in series [3]. A taxonomic revision of this
genus resulted in the inclusion of section Triseminalae
[4]. Krapovickas [5] divided the genus into eight sections
and classified one of the series of section Erectoides,
established by Gregory et al. [4], as a new section called
Procumbensae. The genus is currently divided into nine
sections (Arachis, Caulorrhizae, Erectoides, Extranervosae, Heteranthae, Procumbentes, Rhizomatosae, Trierectoides, and Triseminatae) based on morphology,

geographical distribution and crossability [1]. In this last
revision, two species with trifoliolate leaves from section
Erectoides were transferred to a new section called
Trierectoides.
The systematic relationships among Arachis species
have been inferred using different molecular markers,
such as RAPDs [6], storage proteins [7,8], isozymes
[9,10], variation on sequence of desaturase genes [11],
RFLP [12], microsatellites [13-16], AFLPs [17], cytogenetic and molecular data from AFLP and the trnT-F
plastid region [18], FISH and GISH [19-21]. However,
most of these studies included only species belonging to
section Arachis. Just recently one study that included
species from all sections was published [22].
Understanding the phylogenetic relationships among
Arachis species would contribute to the systematics of
the genus, comprehension of the origins and evolution
of species and sections and the use of species of genus
Arachis. For instance, the circumscriptions of some sections are based in criterions that may not reflect phylogenetic relationships. The maintenance of species
associated respectively to the A and the B genomes of
the cultivated peanut in a single section does not seem
to be natural and it may be an artificial construction
derived from the existence of the peanut, a fixed amphidiploid gathering genetic material from species that
when crossed to each other produce unfertile hybrids at
the diploid level. Also, section Rhizomatosae, a very
important group from the standpoint of forage production, comprises polyploid species (A. glabrata, A. pseudovillosa, A. nitida) and one diploid (A. burkartii) that
RAPD [23] and microsatellite data [24] showed to be

very distinct from the other species in this section. As
mentioned before, phylogenetic information will also
have great impact in the utilization of the species,
mainly those from sections that comprise cultivated species. For instance, for many years A. batizocoi was considered the donor of the B genome of A. hypogaea and
that species was used with moderated success in prebreeding programs. However, molecular and cytogenetic
evidences showed that A. ipaënsis was the most probable donor of B genome of A. hypogaea and A. duranensis the donor of the A genome [25]. That information
was corroborated based on molecular cytogenetics [19]
and crossability [26]. The number of accessions of A.
duranensis is very large [1] comprising large variability
that could be used to improve A. hypogaea through
introgression into its A genome. Besides, the relationships between A genome species are well defined and
they show very good crossability to each other [1]. On
the other hand, there is an unique accession of A. ipaënsis available and the relationships among species of section Arachis that do not have the A genome is not well
defined. The non A genome species group is very
diverse comprising species with different degrees of affinity to the B genome of A. hypogaea [18,27]. Phylogeny
and genomic data also allow a better understanding of
the evolution in section Arachis. For instance, recently
the first comparative genomic study between the genomes of A. hypogaea using microsatellite markers and
two map populations resulting from crosses between
two A genome species and two B genome species was
published [28]. The comparison between the B genome
and A genome maps revealed a high degree of synteny.

The development of genetic maps for Arachis diploid
wild species with A and B genomes associated to phylogenetic studies effectively is a significant advance
towards the construction of a transferable reference
map for Arachis.
The DNA sequence variation observed in the internal
transcribed spacers (ITS1 and ITS2) of nuclear rDNA,
located between the 18 S and 26 S rDNA coding
regions, has been largely used for phylogenetic analysis
at plant genus and species discrimination levels [29-34].
The sequences are relatively easy to align because few
length variations have been observed at the genus level
in flowering plants, they are long enough to offer a sufficient number of potential characters for phylogenetic
reconstruction, and are flanked by regions that are
highly conserved within genera, thus simplifying the isolation and sequencing of the region through the use of
universal primers [35].
The objective of this work was to establish the phylogenetic relationships among species of the genus Arachis. The polymorphism in sequences of internal
transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2 and 5.8 S rDNA coding region was used to determine relationships among
45 species of genus Arachis.

Results and Discussion
We have analyzed 55 accessions encompassing 45 Arachis species and the nine taxonomical sections. Consensus sequences were obtained for each accession using
four to ten reads. The number of reads per accession
varied because their quality also varied. For some species only four reads were necessary to get a good quality
consensus sequence and for some ten reads were
necessary.
In spite of the large number of studies using ITS to
infer phylogeny in a very large number of genus and
families, some authors have criticized the use of these
genomic regions. ITS data may cause incongruence due
to the various mechanisms that can influence ITS variation [33]. Among the most prevalent complications for
phylogenetic inference is the existence in many plant
genomes of extensive sequence variation, arising from
ancient or recent array duplication events, genomic harboring of pseudogenes in various states of decay, and/or
incomplete intra- or interarray homogenization [32].
Despite that, we have used ITS region to infer phylogeny in genus Arachis and, to have insights in how
much the variation in this region may have interfered in
the species relationship establishment, we included
more than one individual from six species (A. pintoi:
two accessions; A. major: two accessions; A. paraguariensis: two accessions; A. magna: two accessions, A.
kuhlmannii: four accessions, A. hoehnei: three accessions). We also included species that are very related to

Page 3 of 12

each other based on different types of evidences, such as
A. hypogaea and A. monticola [12,16,36] and A. repens
and A. pintoi [37,38] and included groups of species
whose high affinity was demonstrated by many different
methods, such as the A genome species [21].
As it can be seen in Figure 1, there was variation
between accessions of the same species which may have
been caused by the ITS variation cited above. The variation found for three species (A. pintoi, A. major, A.
hoehnei) was not enough to place their accessions away
from each other. Arachis magna accessions were not
placed together but they were in the same clade. Arachis
paraguariensis and A. kuhlmannii accessions were, in
general, placed away from each other.
The two accessions of A. paraguariensis analyzed
belong to different subspecies (A. paraguariensis subsp.
paraguariensis and A. paraguariensis subsp. capibarensis). The differentiation between these two subspecies
based on morphology is very difficult but they are considered as different subspecific taxa based on their distinct geographic distribution [1] and SAT chromosome
morphology [39].
Four accessions of A. kuhlmannii were analyzed
(VPoBi 9375 - A. kuhlmannii 1; VSGr 6404 - A. kuhlmannii - 2; VPzRcSgSv 13530 - A. kuhlmannii 3;
VSPmSv 13721 - A. kuhlmannii 4). All of them were
placed in the A genome clade, but into three different
subclades. Arachis kuhlmannii 1 and 2 were placed
close to each other in a clade that also included A.
helodes and A. linearifolia. Arachis kuhlmannii 3 was
placed in a subclade with A. hypogaea, A. correntina, A.
microsperma, A. schininii and A. villosa, while A. kuhlmannii 4 in a clade with A. cardenasii, A. simpsonii, A.
monticola and A. duranensis. Accessions of A. kulhmannii were also placed in different subclusters based on
microsatellite and AFLP data [16,17]. In a dendrogram
obtained using RAPD data, A. kuhlmannii 1, 2 and 4
grouped together and A. kuhlmannii 3 was placed in a
different group that comprised accessions from Mato
Grosso do Sul State in Brazil [40]. Arachis kuhlmannii 4
was collected in Brazil near the frontier with Bolivia,
and probably is more distinct from the other A. kuhlmannii accessions and more related to A. cardenasii. In
the RAPD dendrogram, A. kuhlmannii 4 grouped to A.
simpsonii accession VSPmSv 13728, which was collected
in Bolivia, in the same population where the species
typus was collected.
Thus, the placement of A. paraguariensis and A. kuhlmannii accessions may have been due to factors not
related exclusively to the variation found in ITS regions
since our data corroborates previous studies demonstrating high variability within these species.
The closely related allopolyploid species A. hypogaea
and A. monticola were placed in different clades. It is

known that A. monticola is the closest related species to
A. hypogaea [1]. Despite that, A. monticola was considered as a distinct species from A. hypogaea [1]. However, some doubts about its classification still remain,
because this species has a high crossability with A. hypogaea [1,41]. It is also an allotetraploid and both species
have identical genomes [19,36,39]. Furthermore part of
their geographic distribution overlaps [1]. Molecular
marker data also confirmed the very close genetic relationship between these two species [6,11,13,15,17,42,43].
In our case, despite the causes of variation in ITS
regions, the observed placement of A. hypogaea and A.
monticola was certainly influenced by the fact that these
species have ITS regions from A and B genomes which
our results showed to be different and seem to be specific for each genome type found in genus Arachis. The
sequences of A. hypogaea and A. monticola included in
this study represent one of the genomes and may even
be a mixture of the sequences from both. As mentioned
above the close relationships between these two species
have been demonstrated using different evidences. Thus,
our data is limited to infer phylogenetic relationships
between the allopolyploids as well as their relationships
to the wild diploid species.

Section Heteranthae showed a basal position, followed
by Extranervosae, Triseminatae, Caulorrhizae, and Rhizomatosae Ser. Prorhizomatosae, Procumbentes/Trierectoides/Erectoides/Rhizomatosae and Arachis. Despite the
lack of dating analysis, the position of clades in relation
to the outgroups agreed with DNA content analysis
showing that species with greater DNA content were
included in sections believed to have a more recent origin (Procumbentes, Caulorrhizae, Rhizomatosae and
Arachis), whereas those with lower DNA content in the
most primitive or ancient sections (Extranervosae,
Heteranthae and Triseminatae) [44]. Sections Extranervosae, Heteranthae and Triseminatae are believed to be
among the oldest sections in genus Arachis based on
their affinity with genus Stylosanthes [1].
Section circumscriptions

The results confirmed the circumscriptions of sections
Caulorrhizae and Extranervosae and suggested some
sections may not be natural groups. The circumscriptions of sections Erectoides, Trierectoides and Procumbentes were not well defined, suggesting that these three
sections could be grouped in one or two sections. On
the other hand, our data suggested sections Arachis and

Bechara et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:255
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/255

Rhizomatosae could be divided into two new sections
each.
Sections Trierectoides, Erectoides and Procumbentes
seem to be a monophyletic group. Species from these
sections were distributed in two sub-clades. One of
them comprised three species of section Erectoides (A.
major, A. hermannii and A. brevipetiolata) and two species of section Trierectoides (A. guaranitica and A.
tuberosa). Arachis brevipetiolata was more related to
Trierectoides than to the other two species of Erectoides.
The other sub-clade comprised one species of section
Erectoides (A. paraguariensis), four species of section
Procumbentes (A. appressipila, A. kretschmeri, A.
matiensis, A. pflugeae, and A. sp. 2) and one species of
section Rhizomatosae (A. glabrata). As can be seen in
Table 1, species from sections Trierectoides, Erectoides
and Procumbentes were all put together in the same section for many years and after three taxonomic revisions
of genus Arachis. Only in 1990, some species were put
in a new section called Procumbensae that is the actual
Procumbentes section. Our data supported the first classification [3].
Section Arachis comprises species of three types of
genomes (A, B and D). The crossability and inter-specific hybrid fertility between A genome species and
between some B genome species are very high [12,18].
However, crosses between A and B genome species
result in unfertile hybrids [1]. The cultivated peanut is
fertile just because it had its chromosomes duplicated,
having a diploid-like meiosis, with no pairing of chromosomes from different genomes. Thus, based on the
use of crossability for the establishment of the taxonomic sections it may be considered that, if the peanut
have not evolved, most Arachis specialists would certainly assign the A genome and B genome species to
distinct sections.
The presence of rhizomes is the main reason for a
species to be in section Rhizomatosae, which comprises
three polyploidy species (A. glabrata, A. pseudovillosa,
A. nitida) and one diploid (A. burkartii). RAPD [23] and
microsatellite data [24] showed that the diploid species
is very distinct from the other species of this section.
The different ploidy levels and variation in the ITS
could result in the misplacement of A. glabrata or A.
burkartii. However, we observed in section Arachis,
which also includes diploid and polyploidy species that
ITS variation may result in some unexpected placement
of species, but that is not enough for their placement in
clades of different sections.
Sections Triseminatae and Heteranthae had just one
species analyzed but they were placed in the tree in
individual branches suggesting these sections are also
natural groups. Arachis burkartii had a placement very
similar to those species from sections Triseminatae and

Page 5 of 12

Heteranthae. Thus, based on ours and previous data
[23,24] the establishment of a new section for A. burkartii should be considered.
Section Arachis

The two genomes presented in domesticated peanut differ by one striking feature: one of the genomes (A) has
a pair of chromosomes, called A, which is conspicuously
smaller than the other chromosomes, while the other
genome lacks this small chromosome [25]. The species
of section Arachis are therefore classified as having A or
B genomes based on the presence or absence of the A
pair. A third genome was identified in the genus, the D
genome, which is only found in A. glandulifera [45].
The species of section Arachis were placed in two
clades. The first one was divided into sub-clades. The
first sub-clade comprised A. hoehnei (1,2,3), A. stenosperma (1,2), A. kuhlmannii (1,2), A. helodes and A. linearifolia; the second A. cardenasii, A. kuhlmannii (4), A.
simpsonii, A. monticola and A. duranensis and the third
comprised A. hypogaea, A. correntina, A. microsperma,
A. schininii, A. villosa and A. kuhlmannii (3). Arachis sp
(1) was very related to the A genome species but it was
not included in any of the above clades. The second
clade of section Arachis species was divided into two
sub-clades. The first included 2n = 2x = 20 species and
the other, species with 2n = 2x = 18 (A. decora, A. praecox and A. palustris). The species with 2n = 20 were
separated into two sister subclades, one of them being
formed only by B genome species (A. magna, A. valida,
A. ipaënsis and A. williamsii) and the other included A.
batizocoi (B genome), A. cruziana (B genome) and A.
glandulifera (D genome). Arachis batizocoi and A. cruziana were very recently described as having a K genome
based on FISH mapping of rDNA loci and heterochromatin detection [21].
The first clade of section Arachis included all the A
genome species and A. hoehnei. It was believed that A.
hoehnei did not present the small “A” chromosome pair
[39]. Arachis hoehnei also grouped to A genome species
based on the polymorphism of trnT-F region [18] and
RAPD markers [27], but grouped to other B genome
species based on microsatellite markers [13], and to the
aneuploid (2n = 18) species with AFLP markers [18]. In
our study, three different accessions of this species were
included in the analysis and all of them were placed
close to the A genome species, confirming that this species was correctly placed on the phylogenetic tree. The
cytogenetical analysis of A. hoehnei was recently re-done
and it was verified that this species has the A chromosome pair [21]. Thus, our data suggested A genome species are monophyletic.
The second clade comprised all species of section Arachis that do not have the A chromosome pair. This

Bechara et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:255
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/255

clade included the 2n = 20 species that are classified as
B genome species and the ones that possess 2n = 18
chromosomes (A. decora, A. palustris, and A. praecox).
The 2n = 2x = 18 species lack the small pair of chromosomes characteristic of the A genome species [46]. Lavia
[47] suggested that A. palustris was derived from a species with × = 10 chromosomes and these species are
phylogenetically related to the B genomes. Analyses
based on AFLP [18] and microsatellite [48] data placed
those 2n = 2x = 18 species closely to A genome species.
However, microsatellite markers [13] and sequencing of
the trnT-F region [18] and also our data showed those
species are more closely related to B genome species.
Thus, our study corroborates previous ones [13,18] and
suggested these species originated from B genome
species.
As mentioned above, the non A genome species from
section Arachis with 2n = 20 chromosomes were placed
in two clades. Molecular evidences based on markers
such as RFLPs [42,49], RAPD [6,50], AFLP [17], and
microsatellites [48] suggested that section Arachis
diploids lacking the small A chromosome pair comprise
a very diverse group, of which A. ipaënsis, A. magna, A.
williamsii, and A. valida, closely linked in the present
analysis, plus A. gregoryi [12] are those more closely
associated to the B genome of A. hypogaea/A. monticola.
Hybrids between A. ipaënsis and A. magna have shown
84% viable pollen [1]. Other kinds of evidences, such as
molecular [6,28,43] and morphological [51] data, showed
that these two species are closely related. Crossings
between A. williamsii and A. ipaënsis resulted in hybrids
with 66.9% of pollen stainability [52]. If the latter is the
donor of the B genome to A. hypogaea [25], our data
suggest that A. ipaënsis, A. williamsii, A. magna and A.
valida could be used for the improvement of the B genome of cultivated peanut. This would increase the variability available for this purpose since a single accession
of A. ipaënsis is available.
Arachis batizocoi was very close related to A. cruziana. Arachis batizocoi is considered a good genetic
bridge to transfer genes to cultivated peanut [53,54]. If
the phylogenetic relationships were correlated with the
crossability, as observed among the A genome species
[55,56], A. cruziana would have some crossability with
A. batizocoi and could also be used as bridge for gene
introgression in A. hypogaea. In fact, F1 hybrids between
these two species had 36.4% of pollen viability (male fertility) and 0.3 I (univalents) and 9.9 II (bivalents) [18].
Thus, our data suggested that A. cruziana also can be a
source of genes to A. hypogaea since it is very related to
A. batizocoi.
Arachis glandulifera is classified as D genome since it
does not cross with A. hypogaea and it has the most
asymmetrical karyotype in genus Arachis [45]. Arachis

Page 6 of 12

glandulifera, like the B genome species, does not show
the small pair of chromosomes found in the A genome
species. Isoenzyme [10], RFLP [42], RAPD [6], AFLP
[18] and cytogenetical [57] data also showed that A.
batizocoi and A. glandulifera were closely related. Our
data suggest that A. glandulifera may be derived from a
B genome ancestor species.
Through the analysis of the heterochromatic bands
and 45 S rDNA loci patterns, the species previously
classified as B genome were arranged into three groups
called B (A. ipaënsis, A. magna, A. gregoryi, A. valida
and A. williamsii), K (A. batizocoi, A. cruziana, and A.
krapovickasii) and F (A. benensis and A. trinitensis) [21].
Our data supported the classification in B and K genomes. We have not analyzed species of the new F
genome.
Sections Trierectoides, Erectoides and Procumbentes

As mentioned before the circumscriptions of these three
sections were not clear and because of that their results
were presented and discussed together. Our results
agreed with the classification proposed by Krapovickas
[3] which had all species from those three sections in
only one section, called Erectoides. The data partially
agreed also to a more recent classification proposed by
the same author [5], that divided section Erectoides in
two sections (Erectoides and Procumbensae), since as it
can be seen in Figure 1, species of Erectoides and Trierectoides were all in a same sub-clade and species of Procumbentes were placed all together with A.
paraguariensis and A. glabrata.
Arachis paraguariensis shows low genetic affinity to
the other species of section Erectoides and because it
shows some morphological peculiarities in the root,
flowers and fruits it was suggested that this species
should be segregated in an independent section [1]. Our
results also raised doubt about the classification of this
species, and suggested that A. paraguariensis might be
classified as belonging to section Procumbentes. The
segregation of A. paraguariensis from other Erectoides
species was also observed in phylogeny based on ITS
data using parsimony analysis [22].
The placement of A. glabrata in a clade with Procumbentes and Erectoides species will be discussed in the
section Rhizomatosae item.
The clade formed by sections Erectoides, Trierectoides
and Procumbentes was the most related to section Arachis. Crossability data between members of sections
Arachis and Erectoides suggest that these two sections
are more phylogenetically related to each other than to
the other sections of the genus since pollination has
lead to fertilization. Although there has been no development of the resulting proembryos [58], members of
the other sections do not even show such a degree of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/255

success on crossings with section Arachis [55]. Isozyme
and protein pattern data [8,10] suggested that section
Erectoides and Procumbentes are closely related to the
section Arachis.
Section Caulorrhizae

The morphological traits that have been traditionally
used to distinguish the two type specimens of A. pintoi
(GK 12787) and A. repens (GKP10538) are not sufficient
to differentiate all the accessions collected, as they show
intermediate phenotypes between the extreme types
[59].
The clade was formed by the two species of section
Caulorrhizae, confirming that A. pintoi and A. repens
are very closely related. There were no differences
between the sequences of A. pintoi (CIAT 22237 =
W132) and A. repens (V 5868), and few differences of
these two in relation to accession V 6791, also considered as A. pintoi. RAPD data also suggested they are
very closely related [37]. F1 hybrids between accession
GK 12787 of A. pintoi and accession GKP 10538 of A.
repens, which represent the extreme types, had 86.8%
pollen fertility [55], which is higher than the level of
pollen fertility found in intraespecific hybrids of crosses
between accessions of some other Arachis species
[45,60].
Section Triseminatae

The phylogenetic data showed that A. triseminata was
not closely related to species of any other sections, in
agreement with its placement in a separate section (Triseminatae) [1]. No successful crossings among A. triseminata and members of other sections were obtained
[1,55], showing its genetic isolation from other sections
of genus Arachis.
Section Heteranthae

Arachis pusilla, the only species of section Heteranthae
included in this study, had a basal position, on the first
radiation of genus Arachis (Figure 1) and closely related
to Extranervosae, which formed the second radiation in
the genus. The affinity of Heteranthae and Extranervosae sections agreed with floral morphology, geographical
distribution and crossability data, since the only known
intersectional hybrid of Extranervosae was obtained
from a cross with Heteranthae [1].

Page 7 of 12

hypogaea were placed in different clades, confirming
that the polyploid species evolved independently in the
genus.
Arachis glabrata was more related to species of section Procumbentes than to A. burkartii which is also traditionally allocated in section Rhizomatosae, although in
a series of its own. These species differed on the ploidy
level, since A. glabrata is a tetraploid (2n = 4x = 40)
and A. burkartii a diploid species. Crossings between A.
glabrata and diploid species from other sections
resulted in hybrids, in contrast to A. burkartii, for which
no hybrids were obtained from numerous attempted
crosses [55]. The other tetraploid species analyzed (A.
hypogaea) was placed close to diploid species that have
similar genomes and are certainly involved in its origin
[1,25]. Thus, the data indicated that the referred species
of section Rhizomatosae did not have a monophyletic
origin.
Arachis glabrata was placed in a clade with species
from section Erectoides and Procumbentes. Tetraploid
species of section Rhizomatosae were classified as EERR
[55], and at that time the EE crossing group was attributed to section Erectoides, which comprised all species
that, according to the last classification [1], are distributed in sections Procumbentes, Erectoides and Trierectoides. Thus, based in our and previous data we
suggested the following hypothesis to the origin of A.
glabrata: 1) A. glabrata originated from species of the
Erectoides group, with rhizomes appearing twice, independently, in the evolution of genus Arachis; 2) A. glabrata is an allopolyploid EERR, as previously suggested
[55], that resulted from a cross between one species
from section Erectoides and one species from section
Rhizomatosae, that had a genome not similar to the one
found in A. burkartii.

Conclusion
The main clades established in this study in general
agreed with many other studies that have used other
types of evidences (morphological, crossability, biochemical, cytogenetical and molecular) and different
species, being some of them included in our study and
some not. Thus, the relationships established do
reflects the affinity of the species, and that can be a
useful framework for future systematic reviews of
genus Arachis and for the selection of species to prebreeding programs.

Section Rhizomatosae

Cytogenetic data suggested that the origins of Arachis
tetraploid species (A. glabrata and A. hypogaea) were
independent [61]. An analysis using RFLP markers also
showed that A. glabrata was very distinct from A. hypogaea [49]. In the present study, A. glabrata and A.

Eventually, counts were obtained by the accessions listed.

Brazilian Arachis Germplasm Collection, maintained at
Embrapa Recursos Genéticos e Biotecnologia - CENARGEN (Brasília-DF, Brazil). All plants were grown from
seed or cuttings (sections Rhizomatosae and Caulorrhizae) under greenhouse conditions prior to DNA extraction. Stylosanthes capitata, S. hamata, S. viscosa,
Chapmannia gracilis and C. sericea were used as

outgroups, because these genera are considered to be
closely related to Arachis [1,30,31,62].
DNA extraction and PCR amplification

DNA was extracted from young leaflets of single plants,
using a procedure previously described [63]. Primers
ITS5 (5’GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG3’) and

ITS4 (5’TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC3’) were used to
amplify the two internal transcribed regions, ITS1 and
ITS2, and the 5.8 S gene [64]. Each amplification reaction contained 12 μl of water, 1.5 μl of magnesium
chloride (50 mM), 2.6 μl of 10× Taq polymerase reaction buffer, 1.5 μl of each primer (10 mM), 5.0 μl of a
5 ng/μl DNA dilution, 2.2 μl of dNTPs (2.5 μM each)
and 0.2 μl of Taq DNA polymerase (5 U/μl). The reactions were performed on a PTC 100 (MJ Research)
using the following program: an initial denaturing step
(2 min at 94°C) followed by 35 cycles of the following
steps: denaturing (1 min at 95°C), annealing (1 min at
55°C) and extension (1.30 min at 72°C); and a final
extension step of 10 min at 72°C. The PCR products
were purified using the kit Concert™Rapid PCR Purification System (Life Technologies) before sequencing.
DNA sequencing

PCR products were sequenced using the procedure proposed by Sanger et al. [65]. Each sequence reaction contained: 2 μl of Big Dye™Terminator (Applied
Biosystems), 1.5 μl of PCR product (5 ng/μl), 0.5 μl of
primer solution (0.25 mM) and water up to 10 μl. The
primers used on the sequencing reactions were the
same used on the amplification of the target fragments.
The sequencing reactions were performed on a PTC
100 (M.J. Research) using the following program: 1 min
at 96°C, 40 cycles of 10 sec at 96°C; 10 sec at 55°C; 4
min at 60°C. The sequencing was performed in an ABI
PRISM 377 Automated DNA Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer/
Applied Biosystems). Each DNA strand was sequenced
at least twice to ensure the accuracy of the results.
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis

The phylogenetic analysis was the Bayesian Inference
with the MCMC calculations implemented by Mr. Bayes
3.1 [66]. The best evolution model (GTR+G) was
selected using mrmodeltest [67] and PAUP 4b10 [68].
The model parameters were set in the alignment nexus
file and then ran in Mr. Bayes 3.1, which performed
20,000,000 of generations, sampling trees in each 100
generations. The first 1250 trees were eliminated as the
burn-in. The 50% majority consesus trees was inspected
and prepared in figtree software.
