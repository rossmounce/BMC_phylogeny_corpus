Abstract
Background -: Sucrose content is a highly desirable trait in sugarcane as the worldwide demand for cost-effective biofuels
surges. Sugarcane cultivars differ in their capacity to accumulate sucrose and breeding programs routinely perform crosses to
identify genotypes able to produce more sucrose. Sucrose content in the mature internodes reach around 20% of the culms dry
weight. Genotypes in the populations reflect their genetic program and may display contrasting growth, development, and
physiology, all of which affect carbohydrate metabolism. Few studies have profiled gene expression related to sugarcane's sugar
content. The identification of signal transduction components and transcription factors that might regulate sugar accumulation
is highly desirable if we are to improve this characteristic of sugarcane plants.
Results -: We have evaluated thirty genotypes that have different Brix (sugar) levels and identified genes differentially expressed
in internodes using cDNA microarrays. These genes were compared to existing gene expression data for sugarcane plants
subjected to diverse stress and hormone treatments. The comparisons revealed a strong overlap between the drought and
sucrose-content datasets and a limited overlap with ABA signaling. Genes associated with sucrose content were extensively
validated by qRT-PCR, which highlighted several protein kinases and transcription factors that are likely to be regulators of
sucrose accumulation. The data also indicate that aquaporins, as well as lignin biosynthesis and cell wall metabolism genes, are
strongly related to sucrose accumulation. Moreover, sucrose-associated genes were shown to be directly responsive to short
term sucrose stimuli, confirming their role in sugar-related pathways.
Conclusion -: Gene expression analysis of sugarcane populations contrasting for sucrose content indicated a possible overlap
with drought and cell wall metabolism processes and suggested signaling and transcriptional regulators to be used as molecular
markers in breeding programs. Transgenic research is necessary to further clarify the role of the genes and define targets useful
for sugarcane improvement programs based on transgenic plants.

Background
The importance of bioenergy-generating crops such as
sugarcane is increasing rapidly and is likely to play an
increasing role given the environmental and economical
challenges of fossil fuel usage. Sugarcane belongs to the
Saccharum L. genus, which derives from crosses of the
domesticated species S. officinarum (a group that has
sweet canes with thick and juicy culms), natural hybrids
(S. sinense and S. barberi) and S. spontaneum (a wild species
with no sugar and thin culms). All modern cultivars are
derived from a few intercrossings of these hybrids [1-5].
Sucrose content is a phenotypic characteristic selected
over centuries by breeding programs. Sugarcane cultivars
differ in both maximum sucrose accumulation capacity
and accumulation dynamics during growth [6]. Breeding
programs routinely perform crosses to identify genotypes
able to produce more sucrose early in the crop season to
allow for continuous sugar production throughout the
year. The internodes mature progressively towards the
base of the culms with an increasing concentration of
sucrose at the base. Sucrose content in the mature internodes can reach around 20% of the culms dry weight
while lower sucrose levels are observed in younger internodes where glucose and fructose are predominant.
The improvement of modern cultivars could be achieved
by identifying genes associated with important agronomic
traits, such as sucrose content. These genes can then be
used to generate transgenic plants or can serve as molecular markers for map-assisted breeding [7]. Internodes have
been expression-profiled during culm development [812], but differences between cultivars that contrast for
sucrose content have not been extensively reported.
Understanding differences in the regulation of genes
related directly or indirectly to sucrose accumulation in
different cultivars is an important step if we want to aid
breeding for sugar yield improvement. It is also important
to understand the impact of environmental stresses on
sucrose accumulation and the role of hormones in integrating stress signaling and developmental cues. Water
stress, for example, reduces yield drastically and therefore,
drought-tolerant sugarcane cultivars might be critically
important in a scenario of cultivation expansion since
much of the land available for sugarcane cultivation is
located in regions subjected to drought. Drought
responses include immediate protective measures and
long term growth alterations [13]. Modulation of gene
expression under this stress [14-19] involves ABA-dependent and independent pathways [13]. Carbohydrate
metabolism is also related to abiotic stress responses since
some aspects of the regulation of sugar metabolism are
mediated by ABA and fructose, raffinose and trehalose act
as osmoprotectants [20]. It is important to emphasize that
some sugars (such as glucose, trehalose and sucrose) are
important signaling molecules that affect plant growth

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/120

and development including germination, early vegetative
growth and flowering, as well as a variety of physiological
processes such as photosynthesis, resource partition and
defense responses [21-26]. The pathways activated by sugars cross-talk with other pathways, including those related
to hormonal, cell cycle control and nitrogen responses
[27-30]. ABA and sucrose were shown to be involved in
the control of sucrose levels in plant cells [21] but the
underlying mechanisms are still unknown.
We previously used cDNA microarrays to identify sugarcane genes that are responsive to drought and ABA [31].
The cDNAs are derived from a collection of 237,954 ESTs
developed by the SUCEST sugarcane EST project [32]
which were assembled into 43,141 putative, unique sugarcane transcripts that are referred to as Sugarcane Assembled Sequences (SAS). In this report we present the results
of a large-scale analysis of the transcriptome of thirty genotypes grown in the field. cDNA microarrays were used to
compare high- and low-Brix individuals and a comparison was made to reveal gene expression patterns that correlate with sucrose content, culm development, sugar
treatments, drought and ABA treatment. We performed an
extensive validation of cDNA microarray data using
pooled plants, as well as individual genotypes. The results
indicate a close relationship between sucrose content and
drought signaling.

Results
cDNA microarrays were used to identify genes that were
differentially expressed in genotypes contrasting for
sucrose content. The arrays preparation, validation and
analysis were done as previously described [31]. Multiple
crossings were performed for twelve years among S. officinarum and S. spontaneum (Population 1) and between
commercial varieties SP80-180 and SP80-4966 (Population 2) to generate genotypes with extreme values of sugar
content. The simplest way to access phenotypic differences with a high degree of confidence is to measure
sucrose in the culm juice. This can be done in the field
using a simple refractometer that evaluates Brix (soluble
solids content). In sugarcane most of the soluble solids in
the juice (70 to 91%) correspond to sucrose. Using this
approach, thousands of genotypes can be phenotyped
and contrasting individuals among the populations can
be selected for further agronomic evaluation. Brix measurements were taken from 500 individuals of each population and the extreme clones in this population were
selected and evaluated for sucrose content (see Additional
file 1). To evaluate gene expression samples were collected
from single individuals as well as from pools of seven or
eight plants grown for seven, ten and elevenmonths.
Two experimental designs were used to perform transcriptome comparisons: (I), internodes 1, 5 and 9 from high

Brix plants were compared to the same internodes from
low Brix plants (HB vs LB) in both populations or (II),
mature internodes 9 were compared to immature internodes 1 from plants with high or low Brix in population
2 [33]. Twenty six hybridizations were performed revealing 239 genes associated with sucrose content and regulated during culm development (see Additional file 2 and
Figure 1).
A total of 117 genes were found to be differentially
expressed in at least one comparison between high and
low Brix genotypes (internodes 1, 5 or 9), and ten genes
(SCCCLR1048F03.g, SCCCLR2003E10.g, SCCCRZ1001

Comparison of differential gene expression associated with sucrose content, culm development and
drought responses in sugarcane. Genes were identified
as associated with sucrose content if they were differentially
expressed when high Brix or low Brix pools of plants were
compared. Genes regulated during culm development were
identified by comparing Mature and Immature Internodes.
The drought-responsive genes were found to be induced or
repressed by drought after 24, 72 or 120 h of water deficit.
The figure represents a Venn diagram of the three differential
expression data sets. Technical replicates range from 2 to 16
since genes are spotted several times in the same array. The
credibility level used to define outliers was 0.96 in all three
data sets.

related to development. The gene expression comparison
between mature and immature internodes showed a total
of 173 differentially expressed genes (see Additional file 2
and Figure 1).
Table 1 lists a selection of the differentially expressed
genes along with the number of biological samples that
displayed altered expression when high and low Brix
pools of plants were compared (HB vs LB) and when
mature and immature internodes were compared (MI vs
II). The expression data sets were compared to those
obtained for plants exposed to drought conditions or ABA
treatment [31] (see Additional file 2). Comparison to ABA
treated plants yielded eleven differentially expressed genes
in common, including the ScPKABA1-3 (SCRFL
R1034G06.g) and the ScMAPK-4 (SCSBAM1084E01.g),
which were both more expressed in high Brix and
repressed by ABA, and a PP2C-like protein phosphatase
(SCEPRZ1010E06.g) which showed the opposite profile.
Comparison to drought-regulated genes showed an extensive overlap in differential expression between the two
datasets. Between 117 and 173 genes associated with high
sucrose content and internode development, respectively,
43.6% and 28.3% were previously shown to be altered by
drought while twenty-two genes were altered in all conditions analyzed (Figure 1).
Expression data of forty-two genes was also obtained
using qRT-PCR. We determined gene expression differences for pools of extreme individuals from both populations (Figure 2), in mature and immature internodes
(Figure 3) and in response to drought and ABA treatment
(Figure 4). The significance of the data obtained by qRTPCR was inferred statistically by calculating values of P for
expression differences against the reference sample (see
Methods for details). Overall gene expression data
obtained using cDNA microarrays was confirmed in qRTPCR experiments for over 80% of the genes tested, even
when the target RNA derived from a distinct biological
replicate. We also investigated, using qRT-PCR, how the
expression levels varied among the individual genotypes
from Population 1 (Figure 5). In this case, the value of P
was calculated against the average expression level across
genotypes and the validation rate was around 58%. Additional file 3 lists all the values of P for the validated genes.
In order to unravel signaling aspects of sucrose accumulation, we asked whether genes differentially expressed in
contrasting Brix genotypes or in mature-versus-immature
internodes could represent direct sucrose- and/or glucoseregulated genes and, therefore, be part of the sucrose- and
glucose-response pathways. To this end, sugarcane seedlings were treated with 3% sucrose or 3% glucose for 4 h
and the expression of thirty-four genes was analyzed by
qRT-PCR. The expression of thirty of these genes was

not considered as true sucrose-responsive genes (see Additional file 3). Figure 6 shows the expression pattern of fifteen of these genes. Among the twenty-four sucroseregulated genes, nineteen were also found to respond to

glucose, indicating a significant overlap between these
two signaling pathways (see Additional file 3 and Figure
6). This is not unexpected since sucrose can be readily
converted to glucose and sucrose-specific responsive pathways have been identified previously. The five genes, identified here as genuine sucrose-regulated genes, include

detected, since only three sucrose/glucose-regulated genes
were also modulated by ABA (Table 1). Finally, we
noticed that thirteen of the twenty-four genes exhibited
opposite regulatory responses in high Brix genotypes and/
or mature internodes as compared to the short-term
sugar-induced regulation in seedlings (data not shown).
Together, these data establish the existence of a correlation between high sucrose content and early sucrose and/
or glucose-responsive genes, some of which may be relays
of signal transduction pathways triggered by these sugars.

In addition, we sought to obtain some insight into the
extent to which the short term sucrose and/or glucose regulatory cascade is conserved between sugarcane, a monocot and Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), a model
eudicot organism. Therefore, we compared the data
obtained in this study on sugarcane seedlings with results
described for Arabidopsis seedlings under similar experimental conditions (3% glucose [30] or 0,5% sucrose
[34]). Among the twenty-four sugar-regulated sugarcane
genes, six of them, along with their eight orthologues in
Arabidopsis (forming five groups of orthologues) were
found to be similarly regulated by glucose and/or sucrose
(see Additional file 4 and Additional file 5). The groups of

Discussion
Sugarcane partitions carbon into sucrose that can accumulate to 0.7 M in culms [35]. This unique characteristic has
been exploited and improved by humans through breeding. Studies that shed light on the molecular mechanisms
behind this feature include gene expression and signaling
studies on sink and source regulation [36], QTL studies
for sucrose accumulation [37] and gene expression profiling during internode maturation [10-12,38]. Such studies
indicated that genes associated with sucrose metabolism
are not abundantly expressed in culm tissues while genes
related to synthesis and catalysis of sucrose are turned off
during internode maturation. Genes involved in cellulose
synthesis, cell wall metabolism and lignification are also
regulated during this process. The activity of genes associated with internode development was evaluated in genotypes of S. robustum (which does not accumulate sucrose
to high levels), S. officinarum and in a hybrid [39]. Mature
internodes of all three genotypes showed decreased
expression of cell wall metabolism-associated genes and
increased expression of genes related to sucrose metabolism. While the general conclusion of these studies does
not appear to be in agreement, it is important to note that
the genotypes, environment and age of plants used were
different and that a larger sampling may be necessary to
define gene profiles in sugarcane.
In this work, we evaluated mature and immature internodes of thirty genotypes using cDNA microrrays and
qRT-PCR. Genes associated with sucrose content were
defined through the analysis of segregating populations
selected for one or three generations [40]. Internodes 1, 5
and 9 (In1, 5 and 9) were collected from plants grown in
the field. Among the genes found to be differentially
expressed were those related to hormone signaling (auxin,
ethylene, jasmonates), stress responses (drought, cold,
oxidative), cell wall metabolism, calcium metabolism,
protein kinases, protein phosphatases and transcription
factors. We compared high Brix plants against low Brix
plants by hybridizing pairwise the In1, In5 and In9 tissues
directly (HB vs LB hybridizations) or by hybridizing
mature against immature internodes (MI vs II). We validated gene expression by qRT-PCR in pools of clones and
many individual genotypes. We also investigated if genes
associated with sucrose content were responsive to
sucrose or glucose treatments. Many of the sucrose-associated genes that are regulated during development are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/120

associated with drought responses or are modulated by
ABA or sugars, as discussed below (see Additional file 2
and Table 1).
Protein kinases and calcium signaling
Protein phosphorylation appears to play a predominant
role in sucrose accumulation and culm development. We
have previously categorized sugarcane proteins with a
PKinase domain using a phylogenetic approach and
named sugarcane protein kinases (PKs) according to the
groups obtained, similarity to other kinases and additional domains observed [31]. We now add evidence that
several of these genes are regulated during culm development.

A total of fifty-four genes corresponding to PKs, protein
phosphatases (PPases) or receptor-like kinases (RLKs)
were differentially expressed in high Brix plants or during
culm maturation (see Additional file 2). ScMAPK-4
(SCSBAM1084E01.g) was more highly expressed in high
Brix and mature internodes (Table 1). A MAPK kinase was
reported to be involved in the regulation of source metabolism by glucose and stress, which is an indication that
ScMAPK-4 might be important in establishing sink-source
relationships in sugarcane [36,41]. The most predominant PK category altered is the SNF1-like kinase family of
proteins. In yeast, SNF1 regulates the expression of genes
coding for carbohydrate metabolism and other metabolic
enzymes [42]. In plants, SNF1-related kinases have been
named SnRK1 [43] and comprise three distinct sub-families (SnRK1, SnRK2 and SnRK3). In sugarcane, we have
identified members of all three sub-families [31]. Analogous to SNF1, plant SnRK1s also regulate carbon metabolism at the level of gene expression. At least three
important biosynthetic enzymes have been identified as
biological substrates of SnRK1s: hydroxymethylglutarylCoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) [44]; sucrose-phosphate synthase [45] and nitrate reductase [46]. It is possible to make a direct parallel between sucrose
accumulation and the gene expression levels for an
ScSnRK1 (SCJFRZ2032G01.g). ScSnRK1-2 and four 14-33 proteins of the GF14 type (SCCCLR1022D05.g,
SCCCRZ1001D02.g,
SCEQRT1031D02.g
and
SCEQRT1025D06.g) were expressed at lower levels in
mature internodes (Table 1). 14-3-3 proteins, together
with a SnRK1, phosphorylate and inhibit the enzyme
sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) in vitro [45,47]. Our
findings suggest that the decrease in the expression of
these genes in the mature internodes may allow for
increased sucrose accumulation. We also observed that
ScSnRK1-2 was induced by sucrose treatment, while most
of the ScCIPKs and ScPKABA and ScOSAPK genes were
repressed (Table 1). This is an interesting finding that may

functionally distinguish the pathways triggered by these
kinases in response to sucrose and stress.
Members of the SnRK2 and SnRK3 sub-family including
two Osmotic Stress-Activated Kinases – OSA-PK
(SCEPRZ1009C10.g and SCCCST1004A07.g) and three
CBL-interacting Protein Kinases – CIPK (SCJFRZ
2032C08.g, SCMCRT2103B04.g and SCJLRZ1023H04.g)
were identified as developmentally regulated during culm
maturation (Table 1). Most importantly, three CIPKs
(SCBFSB1046D04.g, SCMC RT2103B04.g, SCCC
LR1C05B07.g) were more highly expressed in high Brix
plants. CBL are regulatory subunits similar to calcineurin
that bind to and respond to calcium signals [48]. It has
been shown that OSA-PKs and CIPKs mediate drought,
osmotic, saline and cold stresses in response to ABA and
calcium [49]. Among our differentially expressed genes we
found nine genes associated with calcium signaling
(SCVPLR1049C09.g, SCCCRZ1C01H06.g, SCJL LR1108
H07.g, SCEZLB1012F10.g, SCCCAM1001A03.g, SCAGL
R1043F02.g, SCCCCL3120G07.g, SCCC RZ1003A03.g,
SCRFLR2037F09.g) and a calcium-dependent protein
kinase (SCEQRT2099H01.g – ScCDPK-27) that also indicates a role for this second messenger in sucrose accumulation in sugarcane (Table 1). Sucrose synthesis control
depends on the activity of the sucrose phosphate synthase, which catalyses the synthesis of sucrose 6-phosphate from UDP-glucose and fructose 6-phosphate.
Sucrose breakdown depends on the activity of invertase,
which breaks down sucrose into glucose and fructose, and
on the activity of sucrose synthase, that converts sucrose in
fructose and UDP-glucose in the presence of UDP [35].
Several studies have shown that some CDPKs phosphorylate and regulate sucrose synthase [50-53]. Studies on the
maize sucrose synthase showed that phosphorylation of
this enzyme on the Ser-15 by CDPKs stimulates the
sucrose breakdown activity of this enzyme [50,52].
Besides, CDPKs can phosphorylate residue Ser-170 of this
enzyme directing it to the degradation pathway via proteosome 26S [52,54]. The decrease in expression of
ScCDPK-27 in the mature internode correlates well with
increased sucrose in this organ. The activity of sucrose synthase modulates the source-drain relationship [55,56],
which eventually determines sucrose content in sugarcane
internodes. Additionally, some CDPKs can phosphorylate
and inactivate the enzyme sucrose phosphate synthase
[57,58], which might contribute to lower sucrose in culms
when this enzyme is expressed in high levels, such as seen
in low Brix genotypes. Since sucrose biosynthesis is a process regulated by calcium, CDPKs and SnRKs, the genes differentially expressed observed in the high Brix genotypes
may all contribute and act as critical control points in
sucrose accumulation in this grass.

Drought signaling
We found a prevalence of gene families regulated by ABA,
drought and other stresses among the genes associated
with sucrose content [33]. Sixty-nine genes associated
with sucrose content were identified to be regulated in
response to drought and eleven to ABA (see Additional
file 2). This is a strong indication that some of the pathways associated with sucrose content and culm development may overlap with stress signaling pathways. A
similar finding was described by Casu and colleagues that
found many stress-related genes expressed in culms [11].
Overall, around 32% of the genes previously found to be
responsive to drought are associated with sucrose content
(Figure 1). It is generally known that sugarcane plants
maturation is favoured by the exposure to a period of low
water precipitation. It is possible that increased sucrose
content is dependent on a drought season and that plants
converge the drought and sucrose signaling pathways to
sustain growth even during the stress season. Sugars that
transduce stress signals or act as osmoprotectants, like
fructose, raffinose and trehalose [20] could be central
players during this process. A PP from the PP2C family
(SCEPRZ1010E06.g) similar to a PPase that transduces
the ABA signal was identified as associated with Brix,
drought and ABA (Table 1). This PPase was less expressed
in high Brix, reduced in the mature internodes and
induced by drought and ABA. A similarity search showed
that this PP2C is very similar to ABI1 and ABI2 from Arabidopsis thaliana. PP2Cs that are part of the ABA signaling
pathway, such as ABI1, ABI2, AtPP2CA and AtP2CHA,
have their transcript levels increased by this phytohormone [59,60]. Among the processes regulated by ABI1
and ABI2 is stomatal closure, which is certainly one of the
first protective measures during drought signaling. Moreover, some of the ABA biosynthesis enzymes are induced
by drought and osmotic stress [61]. The fact that sugarcane genes associated with ABA and drought signaling are
differentially regulated in plants with distinct sucrose
accumulation capacities is an indicative that the role of
ABA is well worth being further verified.

Drought responses vary depending on the duration and
intensity of the stimulus and comprehend protective alterations and long term growth changes [13]. Many genes
responsive to drought have been catalogued [14-18]. The
drought stimulus lead to transient calcium fluxes, the activation of calcium sensors, the accumulation of reactive
oxygen species, the activation of the MAPK pathway and
the induction of several transcription factors including
DREB2A, DREB2B [62] and NAC [63]. We have found,
among the genes associated with sucrose content, many
components of the gene families mentioned above. A
MAPK was more expressed in high Brix and in mature

internodes and repressed by ABA (SCSBAM1084E01.g), a
DREB
was induced during culm maturation
(SCCCLR1001D10.g) (Table 1) and over forty stress
responsive genes were identified (Additional file 2). A
DEHYDRIN TYPE 1 (SCQGLR1085F11.g) regulated by
the DREB signaling cascade [64] was dramatically
repressed in mature internodes of high and low Brix
plants and induced after 72 h and 120 h drought treatment (Table 1). A barley dehydrin gene, DHN1, was
highly expressed in cells cultured at 25°C and 2°C in
media containing high sucrose but our data indicated the
dehydrin expression may not be a consequence to high
sucrose since immature internodes do not have high levels of this sugar [65]. Overexpression of DREB2A in Arabidopsis thaliana led to the generation of transgenic plants
more tolerant to drought [66,67]. It is possible that some
of the genotypes may indeed be more resistant to drought
and thus able to grow and accumulate more sucrose, but
additional experiments are necessary to verify this hypothesis.
Transcription factors and hormone signaling
We have recently integrated and evaluated the SUCEST
and PlantGDB http://planttfdb.cbi.pku.edu.cn/web/
index.php?sp=so EST databases for putative Transcription
Factors and identified 2,406 candidate TFs. These were
classified into families and can be found at http://gras
sius.org[68]. We found twenty-one transcription factors
(TFs) regulated during culm development (Table 1). The
great majority was more expressed in the immature internodes, including two members of the Homeobox
Knotted1-homeodomain
(SCAGLR1021G10.g
and
SCRLAM1010D08.g), which have been shown to be
involved in developmental processes in maize [69].
Developmentally regulated genes include a homolog
(SCBFAD1046D01.g) to anthocyanin regulatory R-S protein containing a helix-loop-helix (HLH) domain, that
controls tissue-specific synthesis of anthocyanin pigments
[70]. Nine transcription factors were identified as differentially expressed when high Brix and low Brix genotypes
were compared including an ARF6 (AUXIN RESPONSE
FACTOR6a) (SCEZLB1010E10.g), a NAM (NO APICAL
MERISTEM) (SCCCLR2003E10.g) and an EIL (ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE) (SCCCRZ1004H12.g) (Table
1). The NAM transcript was less abundant in both populations analysed, negatively regulated by sucrose and glucose treatment and induced by drought (Table 1 and
Figure 4). NAM transcription factors in Oryza sativa have
been described as important regulators of drought tolerance [63]. This may indicate a connection between these
signaling pathways [71], possible co-regulation associated
with sucrose content and cross-talks or signaling overlaps
between sugar sensing, sugar mobilization and drought
responses.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/120

Among the genes more expressed in the immature internodes, we also found several genes similar to auxin, ethylene and giberellin-responsive TFs (Table 1). We found a
second TF related to ARF6 (SCCCLR1024F10.g) and four
AUXIN RESPONSE PROTEINS (SCCCRZ1001G10.g,
SCVPLR2005H03.g,
SCJFRZ2009F04.g,
SCJLLR1
054C09.g) more expressed in immature internodes. Signaling by auxins during culm development was also
pointed out by the altered expression of two nitrilase
genes (SCEQRT1028H06.g and SCRFLR1012D12.g) with
a putative role in this hormone's biosynthesis, an auxin
efflux carrier (SCCCAM2004G02.g) and a AUXIN
REPRESSED PROTEIN (SCCCLR2002F08.g) which is upregulated in mature internodes. One of the nitrilases
(SCEQRT1028H06.g) was induced after 72h of drought
[31] and its expression level was confirmed by qRT-PCR
(Figure
4).
Another
drought-induced
nitrilase
(SCCCCL6002B05.g) was found more expressed in high
Brix plants. This gene is highly similar to the maize
ZmNIT2 gene, which converts indole-3-acetonitrile to
indole-3-acetic acid [72]. Overall, differential expression
of auxin signaling genes during internode development
and/or association with sucrose content was observed in
twenty different biological samples.
Ethylene was observed as a putative modulator of this
process (Table 1). One EIL was found less expressed in
high Brix plants (SCCCRZ1004H12.g) and two were less
expressed in mature internodes (SCBGFL4052C11.g and
SCCCRZ1004H12.g). Besides, one ACC oxidase
(SCVPLR2012A10.g) was found to be more expressed in
high Brix plants and less expressed in mature internodes.
Jasmonic Acid biosynthesis also seems to have a relevant
role in culm development since several enzymes envolved
in methyl jasmonate biosynthesis were found to be more
expressed in immature internodes, two lipoxygenases
(SCCCRT1001E01.g and SCJFRT1007H07.g) and an
Omega-6 fatty acid desaturase (SCCCLR1C03G01.g)
(Table 1).
Cell wall biosynthesis
There were several genes with a putative function in cell
wall metabolism that were among the differentially
expressed
genes,
such
as
the
expansins
SCQGRT1040G03.g and SCCCLR2C02A05.g (Table 1).
Similar genes were found to be expressed in two-day-old
rice seedlings, a stage where rapid cell elongation occurs
accompanied by cell division [73]. The authors believe
EXP activity may be required for cell expansion. Expansins
may act in the relaxation of the cell wall, possibly by
breaking the bonds between cellulose microfibrils and
matrix polysaccharides [74,75] allowing for cell expansion. Our data indicates that, in sugarcane, a gene similar

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:120

to EXPA23 (SCQGRT1040G03.g) is more expressed in 7month old high Brix plants as compared to low-Brix
plants, and the EXPA11 (SCCCLR2C02A05.g) in turn, is
more expressed in low Brix plants (after 11 months of
planting) (Table 1). As mentioned above, we have evidence that auxin signaling is highly active in immature
internodes. Auxin signaling is associated with plant cell
expansion [76], which may be an additional evidence that
the high Brix plants selected have cell expansion alterations that might confer higher sucrose accumulation
capacity. These observations are corroborated by the identification of a XYLOGLUCAN ENDO-B-1,4 GLUCANASE
(XTH) (SCBFLR1039B05.g) that is more expressed in
immature internodes (Table 1). XTHs can hydrolyse
xyloglucans, major components of plant cell walls, and
transglycosylate residues into growing xyloglucan chains,
that may be important during tissue expansion [77]. Our
data is in agreement with previous findings from Casu
and colleagues [12] that identified five XTHs and four βexpansins less expressed in mature internodes, as well as
two caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferases induced in
mature internodes.
We found five genes of the lignin biosynthesis pathway
associated with sucrose content (Table 1). The first step in
lignin biosynthesis in plants is the deamination of L-phenylalanine by Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase (PAL) to
cinnamic Acid. PAL is the first enzyme of the phenylpropanoid pathway [78]. It converts L-phenylalanine into
trans-cinnamic acid (t-CA), which is further transformed
in plants into many phenylpropanoid compounds, such
as lignins, antioxidants, anthocyanins and flavonoid nodulation factors. We found three PAL genes associated with
sucrose content and more expressed in immature internodes (SCCCLR1048D07.g, SCEQRT1024E12.g and
SCSGAM1094D05.g). SCEQRT1024E12.g was induced
after ABA treatment and repressed after 72 and 120 h
drought stress. The second step in lignin biosynthesis is
catalyzed by a cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) [79]. We
found one SAS less expressed in high Brix similar to a C4H
(SCSGFL4193B05.g). Down the pathway p-Coumaroyl is
transformed into Caffeoyl CoA by a p-coumaroyl shikimate 3'-hydroxylase (C3H). One SAS similar to a C3H
(SCACSB1037A07.g) was found less expressed in high
Brix plants. We also observed a FERULATE 5-HYDROXYLASE (F5H) (SCEZHR1087F06.g) and a CAFFEIC ACID 3O-METHYLTRANSFERASE (COMT) (SCRFLR1012F12.g)
more expressed in mature internodes. F5H was less
expressed in high Brix while COMT was induced (Table
1). While all the above mentioned genes may have a role
in cell wall metabolism, it is important to note that transcinnamic acid can also be converted into salicylic acid and

anthocyanins [80] and, until the activity of these enzymes
is verified, the data can only indicate a putative alteration
in cell wall biosynthesis and modification in the accumulation of sucrose in culms.
Cell wall biosynthesis can reduce sucrose accumulation
since carbon fluxes directed to plant growth and cell wall
expansion may alter carbon partitioning into sucrose. It is
also possible that sucrose accumulation may trigger
increased lignification. One of the PAL enzymes was
induced by sucrose treatment up to 14-fold indicating that
this enzyme is highly responsive to sucrose. An induction
of a COMT gene has already been described during culm
maturation [12] but this is the first report implicating a
PAL, C4H, C3H, F5H and COMT in sucrose content. It is
possible that some of the genotypes analyzed also differ in
biomass content and a continued agronomic evaluation is
necessary to assess how gene expression in the selected
genotypes is related to other characteristics, such as cell
wall composition, growth rates, internode size and width,
number of internodes and drought tolerance, for instance.
Many parameters besides Brix may differ among the genotypes and have not yet been evaluated. It is possible also
that the high Brix genotypes may be more amenable for
acid and enzymatic hydrolysis and cellulosic ethanol production. Silencing of lignin biosynthesis genes has been
shown to benefit sugar release for lignocellulosic biomass
fermentation [81]; it will be thus interesting to test if
altered biomass has been selected for during the breeding
process. At any rate, the alteration of these cell wall biosynthesis genes in association to Brix content is an interesting indication of a correlation between these processes.
A relationship between high sugar content and sugar
signaling
We showed that a set of genes associated with sucrose content is also early sugar-responsive. Since most of these
genes are related to signal transduction (kinases, phosphatases, transcription factors, hormone synthesis) they
are likely to constitute upstream components of the sugar
regulatory cascade. These findings raise the interesting
possibility that sugar signaling may somehow influence
sugar accumulation capacity in sugarcane. How these
genes may influence sucrose accumulation is an open
question. Interestingly, between sucrose/glucose-treated
young seedlings and high Brix genotypes, contrasting
expression patterns were found for 15 genes, while the
remaining 9 genes presented similar regulatory trends
(Table 1 and data not shown). This latter set of genes may
be related to higher sugar fluxes and/or higher sugar sensitivity in high Brix genotypes. Opposite regulatory patterns between young seedlings and internodes of high Brix

genotypes are more difficult to explain, but could reflect
differential developmental-dependent controls. A comparative analysis with Arabidopsis showed that among the
twenty-four sugarcane genes tested, five Arabidopsis-sugarcane probable groups of orthologues and two pairs of Arabidopsis-sugarcane close homologues (sister clades) were
apparently regulated similarly by sugars in seedlings (see
Additional file 4). Orthologous genes of the signal transduction-class, such as those encoding transcription factors
or kinases with conserved regulatory features, are likely to
represent important players in the sugar signal transduction pathways and this can now be tested. Within this
framework, it should also be interesting to further analyze
the integration/interaction of the Arabidopsis CUC1/NACtype transcription factor (At3g1550), which controls
shoot apical meristem formation [82] in the sugar regulatory network.
Data validation across genotypes
To confirm gene expression and evaluate transcript levels
we performed qRT-PCR reactions for forty-two genes.
With a probability value higher than 0.95 we observed
that 80% of the gene expression data obtained using
cDNA microarrays were compatible with the qRT-PCR
data.

Validation of developmental regulation was elucidative of
differences among high Brix and low Brix populations.
ScCIPK-21 for instance, a gene more expressed in high Brix
and in mature internodes, was found to be much more
induced during culm development in the high Brix plants,
what may be an indicative that induction of this gene may
lead to higher sucrose levels. A category that was consistently more expressed in immature internodes and high
Brix and that has been seen to be responsive to drought in
other plants is the aquaporin family of proteins. We
wanted to verify if genes of this family could be useful
expression markers of sucrose content. Five aquaporins,
from both the MIP and PIP sub-families (SCCC
RZ1002E08.g, SCCCST3001H12.g, SCEQRT2100B02.g,
SCCCLR1024C03.g, and SCCCRZ1001F02.g) were regulated during culm development and two of them found to
be associated with high Brix (SCCCST3001H12.g and
SCEQRT2100B02.g) in population 2 (Table 1). This large
family of proteins is primarily involved in the regulation
of water movement between cells and cell compartments,
although many of them also facilitate the passage of small
solutes [83,84]. The accumulation of sucrose in such high
concentrations as seen in sugarcane cells certainly represents an osmotic challenge that demands efficient control
of solute compartmentalization and water transport out
of the vacuoles. As key players in the equilibration of
water potentials via regulation of membrane permeability, aquaporins may have a fundamental role in the proc-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/120

ess of sugar storage in sugarcane vacuoles. It has been
observed in Arabidopsis that loss of the aquaporin TIP1.1
severely affects carbohydrate metabolism and transport
[85], and the authors postulate that this aquaporin could
be involved in a vesicle-based routing of carbohydrates
towards the central vacuole. In our study, expression of
one aquaporin correlated to lower sucrose content in both
populations analyzed. Since differential expression was
determined in pools of seven or eight individuals we
decided to verify how many of the genotypes in those
pools presented the observed expression patterns. Expression data was obtained using qRT-PCR for twelve of the
sixteen extreme individuals of Population 1 (Figure 5).
We calculated the average expression levels across all
twelve
genotypes
for
the
Aquaporin
gene
(SCCCRZ1002E08.g) and observed that the gene was less
expressed in all high Brix genotypes and more expressed
in half of the low Brix genotypes. This is a strong indicative that low expression of this gene has been segregated
and selected by the breeding process and is strongly associated with high sucrose content. To verify if this would be
the case for other differentially expressed genes we evaluated the expression profiles of eleven genes in the twelve
extreme genotypes of Population 1. For some genes, such
as the HLH TF (SCCCRZ1001H05.g), expression was consistently lower than average in all low Brix genotypes, but
found to be higher in only two of the high Brix genotypes
(Figure 5). In this case, the two genotypes had almost
10,000 fold increased expression for the genes, which may
account for the differential expression observed in the
pool used for cDNA microarray analysis. This is an
extreme case and, in general, most of the data shows
around 50% of validation in the individual genotype validations.

Conclusion
Gene expression analysis of sugarcane populations contrasting for sucrose content indicated a possible overlap of
sugar, drought and cell wall metabolism processes and
suggested signaling and transcriptional regulators that
might be useful as molecular markers in breeding programs or as primary targets in a sugarcane improvement
program based on transgenic plants. This work is a first
survey on gene expression related to sucrose content and
some similarities point to conservation between monocot
and dicot sucrose responses. This observation can help to
point the important players in the sugar signal transduction pathways. Due to the diversity of roles described for
the identified genes, additional experiments will be necessary to elucidate their possible roles in the sugarcane
sucrose accumulation process. Our group is currently generating transgenic plants with modified expression levels
for these genes to confirm the hypothesis raised for their
function.

Methods
Biological samples
Population 1 was derived from two intra-specific polycrosses, one among 21 Saccharum officinarum genotypes
(Caiana Fita, IK76108, Lahaina, MZ151, MZ151 roxa,
Sabura, Salangor, Sinimbu, NG213, Fiji 47, Hinahina 18,
Manjri Red, Muntok Java, NG77142, Soff 8268, SS601,
Sylva, NG2880, Vae Vae Ula, IJ76315 and IN8425) and
the other combining 13 Saccharum spontaneum genotypes
(IN8458, IN8488, Krakatau, SES 147b, US56158,
US7440, US851008, UM721, UM691, SES 194, IK7686,
US56193 and US571723). The individuals of these polycrosses were crossed amongst themselves and for each
generation, 500 individuals were sampled for soluble solids (Brix degree). The extreme segregants of the F3 hybrid
individuals were planted in a field in single rows of 5 m
using standard sugarcane cultivation practices. Tissue
samples were collected in March of the following year,
when plants were 10 months old. The Brix degree content
of the 4th–5th internodes of each sugarcane stalk was measured with a portable refractometer (N1 model, ATAGO,
Japan). Additional file 1 lists Brix measurements for the
extreme individuals of both populations [33] and the corresponding sucrose concentration. The average Brix value
for high sugar individuals was 18.10 +/- 1.44 and for low
sugar individuals was 6.70 +/- 0.96 for Population 1.
Sucrose content was 9.2% in high Brix individuals and
1.1% in low Brix individuals for this population. Sugars
were determined as described [86,87].

Population 2 was derived from a cross between two commercial varieties (SP80-180 × SP80-4966). Five hundred
sugarcane F1 plants were field-grown. Seven plants with
extreme Brix values were selected. Population 2 was less
contrasting than Population 1, with an average high Brix
of 18.47 +/- 1.41 and average low Brix of 13.65 +/- 1.27.
Sucrose accumulating tissues (sink tissues, herein internodes) were collected from field grown plants. We have
previously determined using Pair-wise Pearson correlation calculations a high correlation of gene expression
between individuals collected at the same time or within
a short interval of time (0.84 to 0.88), and a lower correlation between individuals collected in different years
(0.61 to 0.64) [88]. Mature (In9), intermediate (In5) and
immature internodes (In1) were then collected from four
selected plants of each genotype at 7, 10 and 11 months
after planting. Tissue collected from the four plants was
pooled, therefore each biological sample corresponds to a
certain tissue derived from four plants, and the gene
expression data reflects the average expression of the
pooled plant tissue. A total of 132 biological samples were
selected for gene expression studies from both popula-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/120

tions. RNA was extracted from tissues of individuals or
pools of eight individuals as described [31].
The cultivar SP90-1638 (Internal Technical Report, CTC,
2002), sensitive to drought, was used for the water deprivation experiments. The experiments were previously
described [31]. Briefly, plants were transferred to pots
containing moist sand under greenhouse conditions. Regular watering was maintained for 90 days, being suppressed after this period for the experimental group. Aerial
parts of six plants for each experimental point were collected 24, 72 and 120 h after the onset of drought for the
control and experimental groups.
For ABA treatment, plants derived from shoot apex of 2month-old sugarcane plants were in vitro cultivated for
approximately three months in a growth chamber as
described [31]. ABA (Sigma Chem. Co) was added to the
culture medium to a final concentration of a 100 μmol.L
-1 whereas control plants were treated with distilled water.
Leaves were collected after 0.5h, 1h, 6h and 12 h of exposure to ABA. Six plantlets were sampled for each time
point.
For sucrose treatment, seeds obtained from a crossing
between SP891046 and IAC912195 varieties were
imbibed in water, incubated for 10 min at 52°C to open
the panicle and sterilized by a 5-min treatment in 70%
ethanol followed by 20-min in 2.5% sodium hypoclorite.
Seeds were then washed 5 times in sterile water and then
transferred to a Musharige and Skoog half-strength solid
growing media [89] containing 0.5% of sucrose. Plates
were incubated in continuous light for 12 days at 28°C.
Subsequently, _seedlings were transferred to liquid MS/2
growth medium without any sugar and further grown for
24 h under weak agitation (60 rpm) and constant light
before being treated with 3% sucrose or 3% glucose or 3%
mannitol (stock solution of 30% in water) or just with
water as control for 4 h. RNA was extracted using Concert®
(Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
Gene expression data
cDNA microarray experiments were conducted and data
extracted as described previously [31]. SUCEST SAS consensus sequences can be found at http://sucest
fun.iq.usp.br/sucestfun/database/Sugarcane-Clustering
.fasta. The corresponding Sugarcane Gene Index contigs

.csv. The designed microarray contains 1830 genes which
yielded 1545 good-quality PCR fragments. Reverse transcription, labeling and hybridizations were done using
the reagents provided with the CyScribe Post-Labeling kit
(GE Healthcare) or SuperScript™ Plus Indirect cDNA Labeling System (Invitrogen, USA). The microarrays were
scanned according to the manufacturer's instructions
using the Generation III System (Molecular Dynamics).
Hybridizations were carried out as described [33].
Two technical replicates were obtained for each microarray experiment. Data were collected using the ArrayVision
(Imaging Research Inc.) software. The fluorescence ratios
were normalized in the MxS space, where M is the base 2
logarithm of the intensities ratio and S is the base 2 logarithm of the average intensity of each spot. The M values
were normalized to account for systematic errors using the
LOWESS fitting. The identification of differentially
expressed genes was performed using a local implementation of the Outliers Search method [31]. The SAS presenting more than 70% of its replicates outside fold-change
cut-off curves were defined as differentially expressed.
Raw data can be found at https://sucestfun.iq.usp.br/pub/
brix/index.html.
Validation of microarray results by real-time PCR (qRTPCR)
Real-time PCR reactions were done essentially as
described [31]. The ratio between the relative amounts of
the target gene and the endogenous control gene in the
qRT-PCR reactions was determined based on the Ct
method [90] with modifications. The normalized expression level was calculated as L = 2-ΔCt and ΔCT = CT, target A
polyubiquitin
(PUB)
gene
CT, reference.
(SCCCST2001G02.g) was used as an endogenous reference in the qRT-PCR reactions of high Brix and low Brix
samples after verification that its mRNA levels were similar in the populations and individual tissues. This PUB
gene was also used for the sucrose-responsive gene expression validation. Drought samples were normalized using
a GAPDH (CA254672.1 [91]), PUB (SCCCST2001G02.g)
or Ubiquitin (SCCCLR1048F12.g) genes and ABA samples using a UBE2 (ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2)
(SCBGLR1002D06.g) or PUB gene (SCCCST2001G02.g).

To access the statistical significance of expression ratios,
we assumed a log-normal model and calculated the probability P = Pr(sample>reference) and P = Pr(sample<reference) for up- and down-regulated genes, respectively. The
expression profile was considered validated when P ≥
0.95. For validation of gene expression differences among
all different genotypes the probability value P of being
greater or smaller than the average expression across all
individuals was calculated depending on whether the con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/120

dition was respectively up- or down-regulated according
to the microarray data.
Comparative sequence analysis
Comparative analysis of sugarcane sugar-responsive genes
was done by constructing phylogenetic trees containing
the corresponding most similar plant sequences. A tblastx
search [92] with the sugar-regulated SAS against a green
plants protein data set including 365,187 proteins
sequences obtained from several genomes (Arabidopsis
thaliana, version 7.0 – http://www.arabidopsis.org; Populus trichocarpa, version 1.1 – http://genome.jgi-psf.org/

matches obtained if this number were lower than 40, were
selected for further analysis. The conserved domains
found among the 40 selected sequences were aligned
using ClustalW [93] to produce ungapped alignments.
The phylogenetic relationship of these aligned sequences
was then constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method
[94] using p-distance. All analysis were conducted in
MEGA4 software [95]. This process allowed identifying
the most probable orthologues sequences of the SAS. The
Arabidopsis orthologues and the Arabidopsis more
closely related homologues (usually one sister clade
which may include at least two Arabidopsis sequences)
were compared with the set of Arabidopsis genes regulated by glucose [30] and/or sucrose [34] using VennMaster 0.37.3 http://www.informatik.uni-ulm.de/ni/staff/
HKestler/vennm/doc.html.
