Abstract
Background: The mammalian heme peroxidases (MHPs) are a medically important group of
enzymes. Included in this group are myeloperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase, lactoperoxidase, and
thyroid peroxidase. These enzymes are associated with such diverse diseases as asthma,
Alzheimer's disease and inflammatory vascular disease. Despite much effort to elucidate a clearer
understanding of the function of the 4 major groups of this multigene family, we still do not have a
clear understanding of their relationships to each other.
Results: Sufficient signal exists for the resolution of the evolutionary relationships of this family of
enzymes. We demonstrate, using a root mean squared deviation statistic, how the removal of the
fastest evolving sites aids in the minimisation of the effect of long branch attraction and the
generation of a highly supported phylogeny. Based on this phylogeny we have pinpointed the amino
acid positions that have most likely contributed to the diverse functions of these enzymes. Many of
these residues are in close proximity to sites implicated in protein misfolding, loss of function or
disease.
Conclusion: Our analysis of all available genomic sequence data for the MHPs from all available
completed mammalian genomes, involved sophisticated methods of phylogeny reconstruction and
data treatment. Our study has (i) fully resolved the phylogeny of the MHPs and the subsequent
pattern of gene duplication, and (ii), we have detected amino acids under positive selection that
have most likely contributed to the observed functional shifts in each type of MHP.

Background
Heme peroxidases are readily abundant enzymes that can
be classified into two major families, namely the animal
and non-animal peroxidases, that have arisen from two
independent evolutionary events [1]. The non-animal
peroxidases include plant, bacterial, fungal and protist

[1]. The classical peroxidase cycle involves the reaction
sequence from native enzyme through compound I, then
compound II and finally back to native enzyme [2]. An
alternative and highly important pathway that mammalian heme peroxidases (MHPs) pass through, depending
on substrate availability, is the halogenation cycle [3]. In

the presence of H2O2 and a halide (especially iodide),
myeloperoxidase (MPO) can catalyse a halogenation reaction that plays an important role in the antibacterial activity of leukocytes [4]. Animal peroxidases are a medically
important group of enzymes implicated in many different
diseases including asthma [5], Alzheimer's disease (AD)
[6] and inflammatory vascular disease [7]. From biochemical studies it is believed that the heme peroxidases for
mammals arose following a number of gene duplication
events [3,8,9].
Gene duplication provides the raw material for evolution
of diversity and is believed to be the principal source of
new genes [10]. The process of gene duplication has a
number of alternative outcomes, and remains a controversial issue. Gene duplicates may become functionally
redundant [11], or functionally divergent. There are a
number of ways in which functional redundant duplicates
can be preserved [12,13]. It has been proposed that the
preservation of duplicates can be brought about by degenerative mutations in the regulatory elements of the duplicates, this is referred to as the Duplication-DegenerationComplementation model (DDC) [13]. The DDC model
does not allow a role for positive selection in the evolution of duplicates and is based solely on a neutral model
with degenerate mutations and subsequent negative selection. Under this model duplicates are preserved as each
accumulates degenerate mutations, resulting in specific
subfunctions that in toto ensure optimal fitness [13].
An alternative mode of duplicate retention is positive
selection. For example, in direct contrast to the predictions of the DDC model it has been shown for human and
mouse that the number of retentions and losses of duplicates fits more consistently with a model incorporating
positive selection [14]. Rapid divergence in gene expression profiles of duplicates following the duplication event
results in expression profiles as diverse as those of singletons. An example of this is the functional redundancy of
transcription factor inhibitors, Iκα and β, that have
acquired different functions through divergence of gene
expression rather than biochemical function [15]. Recent
studies have indicated that for mammalian genomes neofunctionalisation, be it independent of -, or coupled with
– subfunctionalisation, is the most common mode of evolution of gene duplicates [16]. These selective pressures

following the process of gene duplication are key to the
evolution of specificity of divergent multigene families,
such as the MHPs [17].
In those cases where having all duplicates is deleterious,
dosage requirements may cause the partitioning of subfunctions to be favored by positive selection resulting
from selective pressure for the fixation of nonfunctional
or subfunctional alleles. The divergence of function may
occur through neofunctionalisation [18], or, subfunctionalisation where the ancestral function is partitioned
between the duplicates [19] (for detail on current gene
duplication models see [20]).
We hypothesise that the selective pressures on MHPs following gene duplication events will, (i) still be traceable
in the extant sequences of these enzymes, and (ii), will
have contributed to the functional diversity observed in
these enzymes. A fully resolved phylogeny can provide a
basis for such comparative genomic analysis of these
heme peroxidases.
MHPs have been classified into four main families based
on their function; myeloperoxidase (MPO), eosinophil
peroxidase (EPO), lactoperoxidase (LPO) and thyroid
peroxidase (TPO). MPO, EPO and LPO function in antimicrobial and innate immune responses [21-23],
whereas, TPO plays a key role in thyroid hormone biosynthesis [24], see Table 1. A study of the structure-function
relationships of human heme peroxidases suggest that the
evolution of TPO succeeded that of MPO, EPO and LPO,
but that these families shared a common ancestor [3,8,9].
MHPs are present in various tissues and as such their peroxidase function varies depending on tissue of expression.
There are both structural and functional similarities
among this multigene family of enzymes particularly with
respect to their catalytic domains, this reflects their evolutionary relatedness. It has been shown that active site residues are conserved in all heme peroxidases [3,25].
To infer the phylogeny of the MHPs from sequence data,
it is fundamental to consider the challenges associated
with resolving mammalian gene phylogenies. The main
pitfalls include poor phylogenetic signal resulting from
mutationally saturated positions, inadequate modelling
of the evolutionary process and systematic bias due to var-

iable rates of evolution among species or within
sequences [26].
A systematic bias or systematic error is one that results in
greater support for an incorrect conclusion with the accumulation of more data. Long branch attraction (LBA) is
one of the most commonly occurring systematic biases
and is a consequence of unequal evolutionary rates across
lineages. This can occur due to the number of cell divisions per unit time being different in different species or
due to rapid fixation of mutations due to reduced population size, e.g., a bottleneck. Rodent species accumulate
many more mutations within a defined time frame than
larger mammals [27,28]. Therefore, rodentia are often
placed close to the outgroup species on a phylogeny due
to their increased number of mutations. There are a
number of ways in which the noise (LBA) can be minimised. Firstly, the addition of more taxa to the dataset:
denser sampling of species of intermediate generation
time can reduce the effect of LBA by reducing the overall
distances between taxa. Secondly, the use of improved
models of sequence evolution, i.e., models sensitive to
multiple substitutions at the same site and rate heterogeneity across the phylogeny. And finally, stripping the
alignment of its most rapidly evolving sites and using only
the remaining more slowly evolving sites to reconstruct
phylogenies reduces the amount of LBA noise in the dataset [29]. These approaches can be used in combination.
While databases such as Peroxibase [30] house all the upto-date peroxidase sequences [31], we have included only
those MHPs from completed mammalian genomes
(allows us identify species-specific gene birth and death).
We have used Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
methods of phylogeny reconstruction together with the
stripping of the most rapidly evolving sites in the dataset.
The major questions addressed in this study pertain firstly
to the resolution of the evolutionary relationships of these
MHPs using molecular sequence data, and secondly, to
the analysis of functional diversities among these superfamilies using the resolved phylogeny and ML methods
for testing selective pressures.
Selection can be classified as being neutral, purifying or
positive. Positive selection/Adaptive evolution is strongly
indicative of functional shifts within proteins [32]. To
determine what selective pressures may have influenced
the functional diversification of the MHP families, we
tested the data using a variety of ML models of evolution
with different properties. These included models that
allow for only purifying selection and/or neutral evolution, and those that allow for positive selection. Likelihood scores for all alternative models and their null
hypotheses are calculated. The likelihood scores for the
null hypothesis versus the alternative hypothesis for those

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/101

models that are extensions of each other were then compared using a likelihood ratio test (LRT) for goodness-offit. For those models that allow for the estimation of sitespecific evolution, we can identify those amino acids that
have undergone positive selection. The location of these
amino acid positions were estimated using Bayesian statistics and their location and possible functional significance were determined. In our analysis we have shown
that positive selection has contributed to the evolution of
these enzymes following gene duplication events.

Results
Phylogeny Reconstruction
The MHP dataset for this study consisted of 31 single gene
orthologues from MPO, EPO, LPO, and TPO classes, totaling 1,017 aligned positions. The species phylogeny for
the mammals has previously been fully resolved [33]. In
brief, the mammalian species phylogeny describes Marsupialia (i.e. Opossum in our dataset) as outgroup to all
other mammals, followed by the divergence of the Carnivora (i.e. Dog in our dataset) and the Cetacea (i.e. Cows
in our dataset), and finally the emergence of the Euarchontoglires clade (i.e. primates and rodents) [33], see
Figure 1a. The ML phylogenetic tree was estimated using
MultiPhyl [34] and MrBayes 3.1.2 [35], the results were
congruent, see Figure 2a. Each of the four superfamilies
branched into their respective functional groups, with the
members of the TPO superfamily taking the position of
outgroup with high support values. The topology shows
MPO, EPO and LPO shared a most recent common ancestor (MRCA) with a gene duplicate of TPO. The MPO and
EPO groups themselves shared a MRCA and functionally
diverged following a further gene duplication event.
Therefore these two peroxidases (MPO & EPO) are the
most closely related of all the MHPs in this study.

Despite the 4 major clades in the phylogeny corresponding to the 4 major groups of MHPs, the relationships of
the species within these clades conflicts with the previously published mammalian species phylogeny [33]. The
rat and mouse are members of the glires group, and as
such are a sister group to the primates, which together
form the Euarchontoglires mammalian superorder. The
topology seen here for the LPOs (see Figure 2a) suggests
that dog and cow are the outgroup to the primate clade.
This is a common error in mammalian phylogeny reconstruction, and has been proven to be an effect of LBA [36].
Also, for the TPO group opossum is placed next to rat and
mouse and not as the outgroup as expected, suggesting
that the opossum and the rodents have similar rapid rates
of evolution, see Figure 2a.
We adapted the site stripping method using the slowevolving positions for each species in the MSA to reconstruct the phylogeny, while still retaining adequate

amounts of signal [29]. This approach is similar to the
'Slow-Fast Method' [37] and is therefore an approximate
method that removes noise from the data by removing
those sites that are most likely to contain homoplasy and
focusing on the more evolutionary informative positions
for phylogeny reconstruction. Each site within the MSA
was classified according to rates of evolution (estimated
using ML based on a fixed phylogenetic tree). To determine what number of categories to remove, we progressively stripped each category from the most rapidly
evolving sites to the most slowly across the entire MSA.
We also combined removal of the fastest and slowest sites
from the dataset in our analysis, this was initially performed with the PXDN data included, see Figure 1b. Each
time a category was removed the phylogenetic tree was
estimated from the remaining MSA using ML. The ideal
tree was created by pruning the mammalian supertree as
published by Murphy et al. [33] (with the inclusion of
chicken) and is depicted in Figure 1a. The difference
between each site-stripped phylogeny and the ideal phylogeny was calculated using a nodal distance calculation
RMSD [38], see Figure 1b. From Figure 1b, it is seen that
the removal of rapidly evolving sites gradually removes

the noise from the data and the remaining signal moves
towards the canonical species phylogeny [33]. For the
dataset consisting of MHPs and PXDN sequences, the
RMSD value reaches a minimum at the removal of 4 site
categories (8, 7, 6 and 5) leaving a MSA of length 850 sites
(including gaps/missing data), see Figure 2b for resultant
topology, after this point the RMSD values rise, see Figure
1b. It is important to note that the slowest evolving positions can be misleading particularly with excessive
removal of sites, as the number of characters for reconstruction will decrease with every cycle, therefore caution
must be taken in applying this method. This analysis was
also performed on the dataset containing only MHP
sequences, and the RMSD value reaches a minimum at the
removal of 3 site categories (8,7, and 6) leaving a MSA of
length 613 sites (including gaps/missing data), see Figure
3a for resultant topology. The reduced MSA for MHP data
is given in Additional file 1 and the corresponding TOPD
results are given in Additional file 2. The nodal distance
(RMSD) calculation is based entirely on the branching
pattern and hence does not account for evolutionary rate
variation across the phylogeny. Using this site-stripped
MSA the phylogeny was estimated using both MrBayes

and MultiPhyl methods, both of which produced identical phylogenies*. (*We note here that the one exception,
using the Bayesian reconstruction method, was the TPO
primate monophyly was not fully resolved in the TPO
clade but instead supported a human-chimp-macaque
polytomy.)
All gene duplication events were verified using gene tree –
species tree reconciliation. We analysed the resolved MHP
phylogeny (Figure 3a), and identified in total 4 duplication events and 4 losses. This method over prescribes gene
losses as in the case of EPO, where the sequence data was
not available and therefore is assumed to be a loss. There
is an LPO specific duplication event predicted, see Figure
3b. Our results show differential retention and loss in the
LPO lineage following this gene duplication event resulting in the cow species retaining an alternative duplicate
copy to the other mammals in the dataset, as shown in
Figure 3b. This method must be used with caution as it
does not take into account rate heterogeneity amongst
species or sites in the data, and relies solely on the topol-

ogy. However, reciprocal BLAST analysis of the cow
sequence against the other mammal genomes identifies
this sequence as an ortholog.
Functional Diversity and Evolution of Specificity
We wished to test the hypothesis that following the gene
duplication events in the MHPs (as resolved in this study),
selective forces – specifically positive selection – have contributed to the observed changes in function in each of the
4 major groups of MHPs. Tests for heterogeneous selective
pressures were carried out on the resolved phylogeny
using the evolutionary models implemented in PAML
3.15 [39] and the complete MSA. The Dn/Ds ratios were
estimated in a likelihood framework at both site-specific
and lineage-specific levels. A total of seven tests of significance were carried out using χ2 tests of significance, five
site-specific comparisons and two branch-site comparisons were performed.

No positively selected sites were estimated for the one
ratio model (see Additional file 3). Strong purifying selec-

tion across sites was indicated with an ω of 0.1516. However, this model is a poor fit for the data (lnL = 34417.1085). Positive selection was tested in a site-specific manner across the dataset using the site models; M1
(neutral), M2 (selection), M3 discrete (k = 2), M3 discrete
(k = 3), M7 (beta), M8 (beta & omega > 1) and M8a (beta
& omega = 1). The results of the site-specific analysis are
shown in Additional file 3.
Poor likelihood values were achieved using the site-specific models of evolution, however, the most complex sitespecific model used, M8 yielded significant results when it
was tested with its null model M8a. A small proportion of
sites are under relaxed positive selection (Additional file
3). Through the use of Bayesian estimations, four positively selected sites have been identified across the alignment, with posterior probability (PP) > 0.50.
Results of the branch-site model B with each of the families individually labeled as foreground are shown here in
Table 2; see Figure 3a for corresponding foreground
branches. (Results for model A are given in Additional
files 4 and 5). To determine whether there is rate heterogeneity along different branches in the phylogeny, we
compared models allowing for only site-specific evolution with those allowing for branch-site specific evolution
(i.e. M3 K = 2 with Model B and M1 with Model A). Following LRT analysis it was found that both models A and
B were significant following χ2 test with two degrees of
freedom. The likelihood score from model B for each fam-

ily had improved significantly from those obtained using
model A, as a result, model B was determined as the best
fit model in each case tested and these results are summarized in Table 2. Positively selected sites identified with
model B were estimated using the Naïve Empirical Bayes
(NEB) method [40]. The results of which are discussed
now in detail.
Our results show that following gene duplication, each
individual type of MHP has undergone positive selection
in amino acid residues that are unique to that type of
MHP, see Table 2. As positive selection is closely associated with functional shift, we postulate that these positively selected sites have significantly contributed to the
evolution of the functional diversity of these MHPs.
For the MPO superfamily, a total of 19 positively selected
sites were identified (PP > 0.50). We have found functional information from the literature on 11 of these sites,
these are now discussed: Position 80 (Arg) is located
within the propeptide sequence and is under positive
selection. Previous studies indicate that propeptide in
MPO plays a key role in the processing and sorting of
human MPO [41]. Position 568 is under positive selection and is next to the polymorphic site R569W, mutations in position 569 have been shown to suppress
posttranslational processing in MPO [42]. The 2 positions
with strongest support, PP > 0.95, are separated by 8
amino acid residues on the MPO heavy chain, they are
Asn496 and Leu504. These 2 positions along with Tyr500

are in close proximity to the proximal heme ligand in
MPO, His502 [3]. Position 259 (Leu) is located between
two important distal residues, Gln257 and His261,
involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds [3]. His261
has an important role in the formation of compound I, a
redox intermediate of the peroxidase cycle [2]. A further
four sites (Leu630, Gln633, Glu652; (primates Lys652)
and Asn654 (primates Lys654) were identified as positively selected, PP > 0.70, these are located within a
disulfide bond linking helices 19 and 22 on the MPO
heavy chain. Disulfide bonds are associated with the folding and stability of proteins and as such are significant to
the overall function of that protein [43].
For the EPO clade, 28 sites are positively selected, PP >
0.50. We have found functional information for 15 of
these sites. One of these, Asp71, is located in the EPO
propeptide. The inferred phylogeny, shown in Figure 3a,
suggests that MPO and EPO are closely related enzymes,
therefore it may be possible that the EPO propeptide may
also be crucial for the function of EPO. The region separating the catalytic residues Arg377 and His474 [3], contains 8 positively selected sites (PP > 0.50). Arg377 is the
conserved prominent distal amino acid associated with
hydrogen bond formation. The proximal heme ligands
His474 (EPO), His502 (MPO) and His468 (LPO), are
conserved in all the MHPs [3,25]. Six of the 28 positively
selected sites, Arg584, Gln588, Arg591, Ala618, Gly626
and Ala627, are located on the EPO heavy chain within a
single disulfide bond region, this would suggest that they
are structurally and functionally important to EPO. Position 441 has been identified as under positive selection,
this residue has also been noted as being polymorphic in
the human population (Lys/Thr).
There are 18 positively selected sites for the LPO group
(PP > 0.95). We have found functional information on 13
of these sites. Residues Glu72, Asn87 and Trp91 are found
in the LPO propeptide sequence and have a probability of
greater than 0.95 of being positively selected. Residues
Asn255, Phe282, Ser312, Ser352 and Glu355 are all
located in the disulfide bond region (PP > 0.95). From
biochemical analysis both Arg372 (Arg377 in EPO) and
His468 are believed to have catalytic properties, and are
conserved in the MHPs [3,25]. We find positive selection

in His376 (PP > 0.99) just four amino acids downstream
of the first of these catalytic residues (Arg372), interestingly this site is specific to the primate lineage. Also we
have detected positive selection in Glu470 (PP > 0.98)
adjacent to the second catalytic site (His468). We have
also detected positive selection in Asp700 which is a
known genetic variant and Glu240 and Gln245 that are
located to the right and left of a known human polymorphism A244T.
With the TPO clade treated as foreground, 8 sites are positively selected, PP > 0.95. Of these 8 sites, 6 are missing
in the alternatively spliced TPO isoform 5, which exhibits
incorrect protein folding [44]. Asp228 (PP > 0.95),
Ala232 and Ala242 (both PP > 0.50) are in the region of
the TPO active site His239. Glu378 has also been identified as a novel mutational site (E378K) associated with
the common inherited deficiency total iodide organification defect (TIOD) and is under positive selection in our
analysis [45].
Independent analysis for positive selection using
DIVERGE [46] software further supports our findings, see
Table 3 for summary of results. Values greater than zero
for the coefficient of functional divergence, θ, indicate a
functional shift between clusters. Rate heterogeneity
among sites varies with respect to the gamma distribution
(α). We estimated θ for each of the four MHP clusters.
This analysis shows significant functional constraints
among the four MHP clades, with the null hypothesis θ =
0 being rejected for all clusters analysed. The analysis of
closely related MPO and EPO clusters result in the lowest
θ value (0.2833 +/- 0.0837), and both have microbicidal
activity (Table 1). θ increases at least 1.5 fold for the more
distantly related/functionally divergent clusters. These
results provide statistical evidence of the diverse functions
of these MHP enzymes.
We further test the relationship between positive/directional selection and functional shift by analyzing the
effect of these substitutions on the MPO 3D structure, see
Figure 4. Modeling the MPO human sequence using
SwissModel and using the mutate tool in DeepView v3.7,
we have performed in silico site directed mutagenesis on
those sites identified in our study as being positively

selected [47,48]. The structure with positively selected
sites and the heme binding site is shown in Figure 4a. We
find that mutating these positions from their positively
selected state to the ancestral state causes a variety of
effects on the hydrogen bond formation within the 3D
structure, see Table 4 for a summary of the effects on
hydrogen bonds. Hydrogen bonds play an important role
in maintaining the structural integrity of a protein, any
disruption of such forces is likely to upset the balance
between the structural and functional dynamics [49]. On
mutating each of these 19 positively selected amino acids
we find that 4 bonds are lost and 4 are independently
gained in the protein, for summary see Table 4. For the
mutations: N496F, Y500F, and L504T, the positions of the
losses and gains of hydrogen bonds are significant as these
amino acid are in close proximity to the proximal heme
ligand His502, shown in Figure 4a. The mutation from
leucine to threonine at position 504 results in the formation of an additional hydrogen bond between Gly501 and
Leu504. Gly501 is directly bound to the proximal heme
ligand. In addition, the N496F mutation illustrated in Figure 4b, results in the loss of the hydrogen bond with
Asn587. The Asn587 and His502 are connected by a
hydrogen bond [3]. The loss of the hydrogen bond, as a
result of the mutation at position 496, is likely to affect
the structural integrity of the link between Asn587 and

His502. Disruption to the hydrogen bonds in this catalytically important region may have direct implications for
functional divergence of the MPO enzyme. The A471R
mutation results in an increase in the number of hydrogen
bonds associated with this position. This position is
upstream from Asn483 which is thought to be responsible
for MPOs dimer interaction [3]. The mutation from
cysteine to serine at position 316 results in the formation
of a hydrogen bond with Gln329 and the loss of one of
the bonds to Asp593, see Table 4. Cys316 is next to the
single disulphide bridge (Cys319) that connects MPOs
symmetry-related halves [3]. The C316S mutation may
potentially disrupt this disulphide bridge.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/101

Initial ML and Bayesian phylogenies estimated here for
the MHPs support previous biochemical studies [3,8,9].
From Figure 3 the order of gene duplication events can be
traced, with an MPO-EPO-LPO MRCA arising from a gene
duplication with extant TPO; then a further duplication
event that gave rise to, (i) the MPO-EPO MRCA, and (ii),
the lineage leading to extant LPO; and the final and most
recent duplication of the MPO-EPO MRCA into extant
MPO and EPO clades. PXDN is the outgroup to the MHP
sequences and was included in the analysis to illustrate
that TPO is the most ancestral MHP (Figure 2a). However,
the species relationships estimated within these clearly
defined clades were in disagreement with the previously
resolved mammalian phylogeny [33].

rapidly evolving to the most slowly evolving. We observed
that the sequential removal of rapidly evolving categories
of sites from the alignment decreased the difference, in
terms of nodal distance RMSD, between the phylogeny
produced and the ideal phylogeny. This occurred only for
removal of the 4 fastest evolving categories of site from the
alignment. Further removal after this point resulted in
increased RMSD values between the phylogeny produced
and the ideal. The MHP phylogeny shown in Figure 3(a),
with maximum number of sites and minimum amount of
noise. We propose that a possible reason for the presence
of LBA in this dataset is the presence of taxa with vastly
different generation times. The rodentia have previously
been shown as "fast evolving" due to their short germ-line
generation time, whereas species such as dogs and
humans have longer germ-line generation times
[27,28,50]. In any given dataset there are sites that are variable and sites that are invariable, this pattern is conserved
across homologous sequences. In a dataset with a mixture
of germ line generation times, the mutation rate in the
species with shorter germ line generation times will be
higher, because the number of cell divisions per unit time
is greater. Therefore the number of mutations in the variable regions will increase for these species. The result is an
LBA effect derived from having a mixture of long and
short germ line generation times in the dataset, where the
species with a short germ line generation time assumes a
basal position in the phylogeny [26-28]. A number of
approaches have been explored to systematically deal
with fast evolving taxa the most popular include, (1)
reconstructing the phylogeny based on slow evolving sites
(applied here), (2) increasing the sample size, this is
based on the assumption that increasing the sample size
actually increases the number of slowly evolving positions, (3) decreasing the distance to the outgroup, and (4)
using more accurate models of sequence change such as
covarion derivatives.

Including all sites of the alignment in the analysis, we
have shown that the major types of MHP form monophyletic clades and are therefore the result of gene duplication events prior to speciation of modern day
mammals, see Figure 2(a). However, also evident from
Figure 2(a), species with more similar generation times
are clustered together, with species of shorter generation
times and therefore more rapid rates of mutation assuming a basal position in the phylogeny. This observed
branching pattern could be a result of LBA, incorrect
ortholog prediction or hidden paralogy.

Our gene tree – species tree reconciliation analysis has verified the duplication pattern amongst the MHPs. However, we believe that current methods of reconciliation
such as the one used here may be biased towards inferring
excess gene duplication and differential loss events, as is
the case here. The method only considers the topology
and not the corresponding alignment or any rate heterogeneity that may exist [51]. We would also like to highlight that the variation of the "Slow-Fast" method
employed here is an approximate method for a complex
evolutionary dynamic and is not without its limitations.

If a phylogeny is seen to approach the ideal by removing
the most rapidly evolving sites, then we propose that LBA
is most likely to have contributed to the misleading phylogeny. To test for the presence of LBA we calculated 8 categories of rates of evolution for all sites, from the most

Using this fully resolved phylogeny, positively selected
sites have been identified, through the use of Bayesian
estimation, unique to all four MHPs; MPO, EPO, LPO and
TPO. The majority of these sites are in close proximity to
catalytically important residues, suggesting that they may

Discussion and Conclusion
The MHPs are a functionally diverse family of enzymes
which are implicated in a variety of inflammatory and
neurodegenerative diseases such as asthma and AD
respectively. In this study the evolutionary history of the
four major groups of MHPs; MPO, EPO, LPO and TPO,
was investigated allowing for the analysis of their functional diversity.

potentially be linked to functional shifts across the MHPs.
The conserved proximal histidines in close proximity to
sites under positive selection in MPO, EPO and LPO are
crucial in preserving the redox properties of the heme iron
for catalysis [3]. The conserved distal histidines, also
shown here to be in the vicinity of positively selected sites,
act as both proton acceptors and donor to oxygen during
the formation of Compound 1, which is an integral step
in the peroxidase pathway [3]. A number sites identified
under positive selection are located in disulphide bond
regions, which are believed to be crucial to the structure
and function of a protein. Disruption of such regions can
be detrimental to the enzymatic stability and activity
[43,52]. In particular, six sites pertaining to the LPO family are linked to the same disulphide bond. This strongly
suggests that these sites are associated with the unique
function of LPO as they are not present in the two closely
related families MPO and EPO. In the TPO analysis the
majority of the sites with highest probability of being positively selected are located in exon 8 of the protein. Deletion of exon 8 results in misfolding of the TPO protein
[44]. Exon 8 is also believed to be part of TPOs catalytic
centre (exons 8, 9 and 10) [53]. TPO functional defects are
strongly associated with TIOD and several deleterious
mutations within this catalytic region have been reported
[44,53-55]. We also find that one of our positively
selected sites in TPO is associated directly with an inherited deficiency disorder [55].
Our detailed in silico site directed mutagenesis of the positively selected sites in MPO has shown that mutating
these positions from their positively selected amino acid
state to an alternative ancestral state results in loss/gain of
hydrogen bonds between alternative amino acid positions
for other sites in particular in the heme binding region of
the MPO structure. The sites we have identified as positively selected in the MHPs have played a major role in the
functioning of these enzymes as evidenced by mutational
studies, proximity to active sites and catalytic residues,
and inherited disorders.
The results of this study show for the first time from
molecular sequence data (i) how this medically important
group of enzymes are related to each other, and (ii) suggest that following gene duplication, positive selection
has led to the functional diversity observed for the MHPs.

Methods
Sequence Data
Protein coding sequences for MHPs were retrieved from
the Ensembl database for all available completed mammalian genomes using the pre-defined orthologues identified in Ensembl [56]. The mammalian genomes and the
corresponding genome versions used for each of the
major families in our dataset were as follows: Homo sapi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/101

ens v42.36d; Pan troglodytes v42.21a; Macaca mulatta
v42.10b; Mus musculus v42.36c; Rattus norvegicus v42.34l;
Canis familiaris v42.2; Bos taurus v42.2e (no EPO sequence
available), and, Monodelphis domestica v42.36c. Ensembl
identifies orthologues by performing a genome-wide
reciprocal WUBlastp+SmithWaterman search of each gene
across all completed genomes. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is then performed using the MUSCLE software [57] and the best reciprocal hits following the
sequence similarity search. The longest alternative transcript in each case was used. These sequences were combined into a single MHP dataset of 31 sequences. Two
amino acid sequences representing the peroxidasin
(PXDN) family, from the Pan troglodytes and the Gallus gallus genomes, were retrieved from the PeroxiBase database
[31]. The sequence data are given in Table 5.
Multiple Sequence Alignment
Each protein coding sequence in the MHP dataset was
translated to amino acid using in-house translation software. This protein sequence dataset and the two PXDN
sequences were combined to give a dataset of 33
sequences (complete dataset). Both MHP and "complete"
datasets were aligned in ClustalW 1.8 [58] independently
using default parameter settings. The corresponding
nucleotide sequences for the MHP dataset were aligned
with respect to the amino acid MSA with the use of inhouse software to insert gaps in the protein coding
sequence according to their positions in the amino acid
alignment. The nucleotide and subsequent protein MSAs
were manually edited by removing ambiguous regions
from the alignment using the sequence alignment editor,
Se-Al 2.0a11 [59]. The PXDN sequences served as an outgroup for the MHPs and therefore aided in determining
the earliest diverging MHP.
Site Stripping and Phylogeny Reconstruction
The phylogenetic tree for the dataset was estimated using
Bayesian statistics implemented in MrBayes 3.1.2 [35].
The model of amino acid substitution used was JTT [60]
because following model testing using MultiPhyl [34] this
was the model that was best-fit to the data. Using 4
Markov chains for 400,000 generations, trees were sampled every 10 generations with the first 20,000 sampled
trees discarded as burnin. The remaining trees samples
were summarized on a majority rule consensus tree with
clade supports given as Posterior Probabilities (PPs). ML
trees were also inferred using the high-throughput phylogenomics webserver, MultiPhyl [34]. The ML tree was generated using the nearest neighbour interchange (NNI) tree
search algorithm and 100 bootstrap replicates implemented in MultiPhyl [34] under the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) statistic, the selected substitution model
was JTT with invariable sites and a discrete gamma model
of rate heterogeneity. This was repeated a total of 10 times

to generate 1000 bootstrap replicates. (The Bayesian tree
reconstruction methods were applied to the MHP dataset
only).
The resulting phylogenies from both analyses (MrBayes
and MultiPhyl) were then analysed for signatures of LBA.
The rate of evolution at each site in the alignment was
placed into one of 8 categories, 8 being the most rapidly
evolving and 1 being the most conserved, using the maximum likelihood approach implemented in TreePuzzle
5.1 [61]. Sites were progressively removed from the protein MSA according to their evolutionary rate and the
resultant trees were analysed for changes in topology.

Nine separate site-stripped alignments were constructed
by successive removal of the most rapidly evolving sites
[29]. The aforementioned Bayesian method was used to
infer phylogenetic relationships for each of the nine alignments generated. The ML phylogeny was also estimated
for each of the site-stripped alignments from the model of
best-fit following hierarchical likelihood ratio tests
(hLRTs) of alternative models implemented in MultiPhyl
[34].
Nodal Distance Analysis
The pruned nodal distance method implemented in
TOPD/FMTS v3.3 [38] was used to calculate the distance
between each of the site-stripped trees and the ideal tree.

Page 12 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:101

The ideal tree was generated by pruning the resolved
mammalian phylogeny [33] to represent those taxa
present. A distance matrix is calculated for both the sitestripped phylogeny and the ideal phylogeny by counting
the number of nodes that separate every taxon from every
other taxon on the tree. Using the root means squared
deviation (RMSD) implemented in the TOPD/FMTS v3.3
[38] software package, the RMSD between the sitestripped phylogeny matrix and the ideal phylogeny matrix
is calculated. A RMSD value of zero indicates that the two
trees being compared are identical.
Gene Tree – Species Tree Reconciliation
Following nodal distance analysis, the gene phylogeny
with the lowest RMSD value (for the MHP sequences
alone), and the species tree were examined for gene duplication and loss events using the default settings for gene
tree – species tree reconciliation implemented in GeneTree 1.3.0 [62].
Selective Pressure Analysis
Analysis of variation in selective pressure following gene
duplication in the MHPs was carried out using codon substitution models implemented in PAML 3.15 [39]. Both
site-specific and branch-site specific models were applied.
The models used for this analysis allow for heterogeneous
nonsynonymous-to-synonymous rate ratios (ω = Dn/Ds)
across sites and amongst branches/lineages.

An ω-value > 1 indicates positive selection, ω < 1, purifying selection and neutral evolution when ω = 1. The statistically significant model for the data was selected using a
series of LRTs to compare models and their more parameter rich extensions. Tests of significance were carried out
using χ2 tests of significance, the comparisons performed
were; M0 (one ratio) with M3(k = 2)(discrete), M1(neutral) with M2(selection), M3(k = 2) with M3(k = 3) discrete models, M7 (beta) with M8 (beta & omega > 1), M8
(beta & omega > 1) with the null hypothesis M8a (beta &
omega = 1), M1 with model A (branch-site) and finally
M3(k = 2) with model B (branch-site). The models and
approach taken here have been described previously
[39,63].
The probability (PP) of a specific amino acid site belonging to the positively selected category is estimated using
the empirical Bayes method for each superfamily individually [40,64,65].
Functional Divergence analysis
Using the MHP gene phylogeny with the lowest RMSD
value, each of the four MHPs were selected as independent clusters. Using the MHP protein MSA and this MHP
gene phylogeny, statistical analysis implemented in the
software DIVERGE v 1.04 [66,46], was used to estimate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/101

the coefficient of functional divergence (theta ML or θ) for
all pairs of clusters. The following are the clusters used in
the analysis are taken from the resolved phylogeny (from
Figure 3a) (1) MPO Cluster, (2) EPO Cluster, (3) LPO
Cluster, and (4) TPO Cluster.
3D Modeling and In Silico Mutational Analysis
Homology modeling was performed using the human
representative sequence for the MPO family and the first
approach mode implemented by the homology-modeling
server, SWISS-MODEL [48]. The structure was modeled
using the crystal structure of bromide-bound human
MPO isoform C (PDB accession code 1d2vC). The positively selected sites identified from the PAML 3.15 (Yang
1997) analysis were highlighted (in gold) on the 3D structure generated using DeepView v3.7 [47]. The conserved
proximal heme ligand (His 502) was also highlighted (in
blue) on the 3D model. In silico mutational analysis on
these positively sites was carried out and their subsequent
affect on hydrogen bonding was assessed using DeepView
v3.7 [47].

Parameter estimates and likelihood scores for branch-site models:
MPO and EPO clades. This table summarizes the results of ML analysis
on the MHP data, using branch specific models of evolution. The MPO
and EPO clades are treated as foreground lineages independently and all
other peroxidase clades as background. The LRTs are performed between
model A and M1 and model B and M3K2 from Additional file 3.
