Abstract
Background: Carrot (Daucus carota) is a major food crop in the US and worldwide. Its capacity for
storage and its lifecycle as a biennial make it an attractive species for the introduction of foreign genes,
especially for oral delivery of vaccines and other therapeutic proteins. Until recently efforts to express
recombinant proteins in carrot have had limited success in terms of protein accumulation in the edible tap
roots. Plastid genetic engineering offers the potential to overcome this limitation, as demonstrated by the
accumulation of BADH in chromoplasts of carrot taproots to confer exceedingly high levels of salt
resistance. The complete plastid genome of carrot provides essential information required for genetic
engineering. Additionally, the sequence data add to the rapidly growing database of plastid genomes for
assessing phylogenetic relationships among angiosperms.
Results: The complete carrot plastid genome is 155,911 bp in length, with 115 unique genes and 21
duplicated genes within the IR. There are four ribosomal RNAs, 30 distinct tRNA genes and 18 introncontaining genes. Repeat analysis reveals 12 direct and 2 inverted repeats ≥ 30 bp with a sequence identity
≥ 90%. Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences for 61 protein-coding genes using both maximum
parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) were performed for 29 angiosperms. Phylogenies from
both methods provide strong support for the monophyly of several major angiosperm clades, including
monocots, eudicots, rosids, asterids, eurosids II, euasterids I, and euasterids II.
Conclusion: The carrot plastid genome contains a number of dispersed direct and inverted repeats
scattered throughout coding and non-coding regions. This is the first sequenced plastid genome of the
family Apiaceae and only the second published genome sequence of the species-rich euasterid II clade.
Both MP and ML trees provide very strong support (100% bootstrap) for the sister relationship of Daucus
with Panax in the euasterid II clade. These results provide the best taxon sampling of complete chloroplast
genomes and the strongest support yet for the sister relationship of Caryophyllales to the asterids. The
availability of the complete plastid genome sequence should facilitate improved transformation efficiency
and foreign gene expression in carrot through utilization of endogenous flanking sequences and regulatory
elements.

Background
The plastid is a nearly autonomous organelle because it
contains the biochemical machinery necessary to replicate
and transcribe its own genome and carry out protein synthesis. Within angiosperms the plastid genome includes
approximately 120 to 130 genes and usually ranges in size
from 120 to 170 kilobases (kb) [1-3]. Of the estimated
3000 or so distinct proteins found in the higher plant
plastid [4,5] only a small fraction are encoded by the plastid genome [6]. The bulk of the plastid proteome is
nuclear encoded, translated on cytosolic ribosomes and
subsequently translocated across the plastid envelopes
[7].
The circular plastid genome is divided into four regions:
large single copy (LSC), small single copy (SSC) and the
inverted repeat (IR) which is present in exact duplicate
separated by the two single copy regions. Restriction site
analysis indicates that the molecule exists in two orientations present in equimolar proportions within a single
plant [8]. The circular molecule undergoes interconversion into a dumbbell-shaped conformation that is facilitated by the IR. Concerted evolution within the IR [9,10]
suggests intramolecular recombination between the
repeats may be occurring.
The advantages of plastid transformation for bioengineering are several-fold and include the integration of multiple genes in a single transformation event [11-13], lack of
gene silencing [14-16], position effect due to site-specific
transgene integration [17], and minimization of pleiotropic effects due to compartmentalization of recombinant proteins [15,18,19]. The presence of many copies
of the plastid genome within the many plastids in each
cell contributes to high levels of foreign protein expression [14]. Plastid genetic engineering could minimize
transgene escape because of maternal inheritance of transgenes [17,20-24] and the possibility of employing cytoplasmic male sterility to contain transgenes [25].
The ability to transform the plastid genome of higher
plants has facilitated the accumulation of foreign proteins
previously found to be recalcitrant in plant expression systems [26]. Until very recently breakthroughs in this regard
have been limited to Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) where
plastid transformation has become routine [27,28]. As the
field progresses to encompass the expression of vaccine
antigens and other therapeutic proteins via the plastid
genome [29], there is a growing interest in developing a
crop system for oral delivery of these recombinant products. Daucus carota (carrot) has been proposed as an ideal
candidate for this application for several reasons. Cultivated carrot is a biennial, the reproductive structures are
not present until the second year, yet the root crop is suitable for harvest in the first year [30]. This feature further

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/222

ensures the ability to contain foreign genes in the field by
eliminating the possibility of dispersal by pollen and
seed. In terms of storage, the root may be realistically
maintained up to six months without any processing
under typical commercial conditions [31]. With an average annual value of over 70 million dollars, carrot ranks
in the top ten among commercial vegetable crops in the
United States adding to the interest in biotechnological
improvement of this species [31].
Transformation of the carrot plastid genome has been
accomplished, and expression of betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) from spinach in carrot plastids was
found to confer salt tolerance up to 400 mM NaCl [32]. In
this case native carrot plastid sequences flanking the integration site were amplified by PCR from primers derived
from the tobacco genome, due to the scarcity of carrot
plastid DNA sequences in the public databases. Despite
the potential of plastid genetic engineering, this technology has only recently been extended to a few major crops,
including soybean [33], carrot [32] and cotton [34], via
somatic embryogenesis, achieving transgene expression
initially via non-green plastids [28]. Most previous studies
focused on direct organogenesis by bombardment of
leaves containing mature green plastids [28].
Although overall gene content and order are highly conserved among land plants, this same conservation is not
observed in non-coding sequences such as introns and
intergenic spacers (IGS), which along with the untranslated regions of genes (UTRs), comprise about 50 % of the
plastome [35-38]. Genes for input traits such as insect
[14,39] and herbicide resistance [23], salt [32] and
drought tolerance [15] and pathogen resistance [40] as
well as output traits such as the production of therapeutic
proteins [19,41-43] are targeted to IGS regions to avoid
disruption of endogenous genes. Integration of foreign
sequences is dependent on homologous recombination
between the transformation vector and the plastid
genome. It is possible to achieve integration without
100% sequence identity between the vector and plastid
genome sequence but recombination and hence transformation efficiency is impaired when sequences are divergent [37,44]. Additionally, evaluations of UTRs from a
variety of species indicate the need to employ species-specific regulatory elements, such as promoters and translation sequences, to elevate the level of foreign protein
expression [45,46].
Completely sequenced plastid genomes also provide a
valuable source of phylogenetic data for resolving relationships among angiosperms [35,47-50]. The use of
DNA sequences from shared plastid genes provides many
more characters for phylogeny reconstruction relative to
previous molecular phylogenies based on one to several

In this paper, we report on complete plastid genome
sequence of Daucus carota, the first sequenced member of
the family Apiaceae. We describe the organization of this
genome and we present a phylogenetic analysis of Daucus
and 29 other angiosperm plastid genomes based on 61
shared protein-coding genes. This is only the second published plastid genome sequence of the species-rich euasterid II clade. The complete plastid genome sequence of
Daucus also provides valuable information for the application of plastid genetic engineering to this economically
important crop plant [46].

Results

* genes are located in the IR; + genes contain two introns

plastid genes. However, the use of complete plastid
genome sequences is constrained because of limited taxon
sampling, a phenomenon that can often lead to incorrect
tree topologies [e.g., [35,49,51-54]]. Thus, there is an
increased need to expand taxon sampling of complete
plastid genomes to overcome this problem. Currently
there are 35 published plastid genome sequences of
angiosperms [37,55]. Some major lineages have multiple
genome
sequences
available,
especially
basal
angiosperms, monocots, and rosids, whereas other major
clades are represented by only one or two taxa. The euasterid II clade represents one lineage that is undersampled.
This group, comprising four major subclades with approximately 35 families and 32,000 species [56], has only one
published genome sequence from Panax [57,58].

Size, gene content, order and organization of the carrot
plastid genome
The complete Daucus carota plastid genome is 155,911
base pairs (bp) in length (Fig. 1). The inverted repeat is
27,051 bp and the two copies are separated by two single
copy regions; the large single copy region is 84,242 bp
long and the small single copy region is 17,567 bp. There
are a total of 136 predicted coding regions, 115 of which
are unique and 21 are duplicated in the IR. On LSC/IRb
boundary, the IR extends into rps19, resulting in the duplication of a portion of this gene. There are 81 unique protein-coding genes, 10 of which are duplicated in the IR.
Also in the IR region is the ribosomal operon, which
includes all 4 rRNA genes as well as tRNA-Ile and tRNAAla. There are five additional tRNAs within the IR resulting in a total of 37 tRNA genes, 30 of which are unique.
There are 18 genes containing introns, with 15 of these
with only a single intron (Table 1). Non-coding
sequences, including IGS regions and introns, comprise

alignment due to length variation there were 39,490 characters.

Repeat analysis
Repeat analysis identified 12 direct repeats and 2 palindromes of ≥ 30 bp with a sequence identity of ≥ 90 %
(Hamming distance of 3). Repeated sequences were
found in IGS regions, introns and within coding sequence
(Table 2). There are 4 direct repeats in ycf2, with repeated
sequences ranging up to 70 bp in length.

Maximum Parsimony (MP) analyses resulted in a single,
fully resolved tree with a length of 54,140, a consistency
index of 0.44 (excluding uninformative characters) and a
retention index of 0.60 (Fig. 2). Bootstrap analyses indicated that 26 of the 28 nodes were supported by values ≥
95% and 19 of these had a bootstrap value of 100%. Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis resulted in a single tree
with – lnL = 312205.340. ML bootstrap values also were
also high, with values of = 95% for 24 of the 28 nodes and
22 nodes with 100% bootstrap support. The ML and MP
trees had very similar topologies but differed in three
places. (1) The MP tree placed Amborella as the sister
group to all other angiosperms, whereas the ML tree
placed Amborella sister to the Nymphaeales, and together

Phylogenetic analysis
Our phylogenetic data set included 61 protein-coding
genes for 31 taxa (Table 3), including 29 angiosperms and
two gymnosperm outgroups (Pinus and Ginkgo). The data
set comprised 45,582 nucleotide positions but when the
gaps were excluded to avoid regions with ambiguous

this group formed the sister group of all other
angiosperms. Support for the relationships of basal
angiosperms in the MP tree is strong (100%) but only
moderate in the ML tree (65%). (2) The MP tree placed
Calycanthus sister to the eudicots, whereas the ML tree
positioned Calycanthus as sister to a large clade that
included both monocots and eudicots. Support for the
different placements of Calycanthus was weak in both MP
and ML analyses. (3) Relationships among the rosids differed, especially the position of Cucumis and the monophyly of eurosids I. The MP tree (Fig. 2) provides strong
support for the monophyly of the eurosid I clade because

Cucumis is sister to the three legume taxa. In contrast, the
ML tree (Fig. 3) places Cucumis sister to the two examined
taxa of Myrtales, and support for this relationship is not as
strong (88% bootstrap value). These three differences
were detected in recent phylogenies based on complete
plastid genome sequences of basal angiosperms [49] and
rosids [35]. The remaining angiosperms formed two
major clades, one including monocots and a second
including the eudicots (Figs. 2, 3). Monophyly of the
monocots was strongly supported (100% bootstrap value
for both MP and ML). Ranunculales were strongly supported as sister to the remaining eudicots. There were two

Discussion
Implications for plastid genetic engineering
An important agricultural crop worldwide, carrot has long
attracted attention from the research community. It was
the first crop species in which somatic embryogenesis was
demonstrated [59]. This ability, to regenerate entire plants
from cell or tissue cultures, has helped to maintain inter-

est in carrot as our technology has advanced to include the
improvement of agronomic species via genetic manipulation. The carrot nucleus has been the recipient of foreign
genes to confer input characteristics such as pathogen
resistance [60] and herbicide resistance [61]. Recently an
extensive analysis of four Agrobacterium rhizogenes strains
and twelve Daucus carota genotypes examined the utility
of green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a selectable marker
for nuclear transformants [62] demonstrating continued
interest in this system for expression of foreign proteins.
Most interesting has been the exploration of carrot as an
ideal platform for the production of proteins of signifi-

cance to pharmacology. The small isoform of human
glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) has been identified
as a major autoantigen contributing to the onset of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) [63]. Expression
of the GAD65 cDNA in transgenic carrot and tobacco
resulted in an immunoreactive product which retained
appropriate enzymatic function. Unfortunately levels of
expression were quite low for both tobacco leaves and carrot taproots, on the order of 0.040 % and 0.012 % of total
soluble protein (TSP), respectively [64]. A heterologous
version of human GAD65 having the N-terminus substituted with GAD67 from rat was expressed in tobacco and
was able to achieve stable accumulation of functional
immunoreactive product up to 0.19% of the TSP.
Although oral administration of disease associated
autoantigens such as GAD65 can lead to the induction of
tolerance in the murine model, dosage on the order of
milligrams per week per mouse are required [65]. Expression levels and stable accumulation will have to be
improved by orders of magnitude to make oral dosage
truly feasible.

sequences that were PCR-amplified from the native carrot
plastid ribosomal operon, whereas the regulatory
sequences used to facilitate expression of the transgenes
were derived from tobacco and bacteriophage T7. When
assayed for BADH enzyme function, roots of carrot plastid
transformants showed activity up to 74.8 % of leaf tissue.
In root tissues, plastome copy number is generally about
5 % of the level in mature leaves. The notably high activity
is probably due to the elevated concentration of root
chromoplasts in carrot, the plastid type responsible for
the orange coloration. With the availability of the entire
carrot plastid genome sequence, it will now be possible to
incorporate native translation regulatory sequences into
transformation constructs to further enhance foreign protein accumulation in carrot plastids. Additionally,
detailed knowledge of this genome will allow the identification of optimal intergenic spacer regions for the integration of transgenes.

The need for an alternative expression system to obtain
high levels of protein accumulation in carrot roots
becomes apparent if efficacious oral delivery is to be
accomplished. Furthermore a system for oral delivery of
antigens should ideally include the adjuvant, limiting further the need for post harvest processing. Transformation
of the plant plastid has demonstrated the capacity to produce substantial quantities of functional and immunoreactive proteins [reviewed in [29]].

Receptor-mediated translocation of antigens and other
pharmaceutical proteins across the intestinal mucosa
offers the potential to make plant-produced, orally delivered vaccines and therapeutics a reality. The toxin of Vibrio
cholerae (CT) is recognized as one of the most potent
mucosal adjuvants. The holotoxin is composed of the A
subunit, responsible for toxicity, and the non-toxic homopentameric B subunit (CTB), which facilitates entry into
epithelial cells of the intestine by binding the GM1 receptor followed by endocytosis. Recombinant forms excluding the A subunit are rendered non-toxic, and when fused
to another antigen, the B subunit cannot only carry this
antigen across the intestine, but also strongly potentiate
the antigen's immunogenicity [72,73]. Recently a fusion
construct of CTB and GFP expressed in transplastomic
tobacco demonstrated the efficacy of CTB to deliver foreign proteins to the circulatory system of mice, which
were fed pulverized leaf tissue from plastid transformants.
Between the two protein sequences investigators included
the cleavage site for the ubiquitous protease furin to facilitate the intracellular cleavage of GFP. Quantitative ELISA
revealed accumulation of CTB-GFP in transgenic plants
ranging from 19.09 to 21.3% of TSP. Following oral
administration of CTB-GFP expressing leaf material to
mice, fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed the presence of GFP in the mouse
intestinal mucosa, liver and spleen while CTB remained in
the intestinal cells [74]. Remarkable levels of protein accumulation coupled to a receptor-mediated oral delivery
mechanism offers realistic hope for the possibility of
plant-derived, orally delivered therapeutic proteins.

Stable transformation of the Daucus carota plastid genome
via somatic embryogenesis has been demonstrated
recently [32]. Integration of foreign genes in these experiments was accomplished through the use of flanking

Genome organization and evolution

Vaccine antigens have been expressed in a number of
plant species [66-69], including carrot. Transformation
experiments have introduced a hemagglutinin glycoprotein [70] and a novel chimeric polyepitope antigen [71],
both for neutralizing immunization against measles virus
into the carrot nuclear genome. Extracted proteins demonstrated immunogenicity, raising antibody titers in sera
of injected mice. However, quantitative data on protein
accumulation in transgenic plants is lacking, especially for
taproots. An estimate based on ELISA of 2% of membrane
fraction in crude membrane preparations from carrot leaf
is offered, but no mention is made of protein content in
the root [70]. It is noteworthy that these extracts were
homogenized with Freund's adjuvant (1:1) prior to initial
injection and at each boost. Freund's adjuvant is
employed to enhance antibody formation suggesting that
plant extracts from nuclear transformants were insufficient to induce the desired immune response.

of the genome at 155,911 bp is also within the known
range for angiosperms, which generally vary from
150,519 [75] to 162,686 bp [47] for taxa that have both
copies of the IR. The size of the Daucus IR at 27,051 bp is
at the upper end of the size range of other sequenced
genomes, which vary from 23,302 (Calycanthus) [76] to
27,807 (Oenothera) bp [77]. Gene content and order of
the Daucus plastid genome are identical to Panax [58], the
only other published euasterid II genome.

Finally, the multiple plastid gene phylogenies also provide strong support for the monophyly of the euasterid II
clade (Figs. 2, 3). This result is not surprising given that
the Araliaceae (Panax) and Apiaceae (Daucus) have been
considered sister families for a long time based on both
morphological and molecular data [56]. Expanded taxon
sampling of the other three major clades of euasterids II is
needed to further test the monophyly and relationships of
this large, diverse angiosperm clade.

A number of recent comparisons of plastid genomes of
angiosperms have identified dispersed direct and inverted
repeats [35-37,78]. The carrot genome contains similar
numbers and sizes of repeats to these other angiosperms
(Table 2, Fig. 1). In most cases, these repeats are located in
intergenic spacer regions and in introns but several also
occur in tRNAs and protein-coding genes. Examination of
repeats in highly rearranged algal and angiosperm
genomes have demonstrated a correlation between both
the number and location of the repeats and the propensity
for rearrangements [79,80]. The role of dispersed repeats
in unrearranged plastid genomes remains unknown.

Conclusion

Phylogenetic implications
The phylogenies based on 61 protein-coding plastid genes
for 29 angiosperms (Figs. 2, 3) are largely congruent with
relationships suggested by previous studies based single
and multiple genes [56] and a number of recent phylogenies based on complete plastid genome sequences
[35,36,48-50,76,81]. There is strong support for the
monophyly the major clades of angiosperms, including
monocots, eudicots, rosids, asterids, eurosids II, asterids I
and asterid II. The three areas of incongruence between
the MP and ML trees regarding relationships of basal
angiosperms, Calycanthus, and eurosids I were identified
previously [35,49], and are likely due to limited taxon
sampling and misspecification of model parameters in
large concatenated, multigene data sets.

The position of Caryophyllales within angiosperms has
been controversial in the past. Previous molecular phylogenies clearly indicated that this order is a member of the
eudicot clade [56], but relationships of Caryophyllales to
other major eudicot lineages remains uncertain. The order
has been suggested to be allied to rosids, asterids, or simply as an unresolved major eudicot clade sister to the Dilleniaceae [82]. Two recent phylogenies based on 61
shared plastid gene sequences provided support for a sister relationship between the Caryophyllales and asterids
[35,36], however, only a single representative of the euasterid II clade was included. The addition of the Daucus
plastid genome to this data set increases the level of support for a sister relationship of asterids and Caryophyllales (Figs. 2, 3).

This is the first sequenced plastid genome of the family
Apiaceae and only the second published genome
sequence of the species-rich euasterid II clade. Both MP
and ML trees provide very strong support (100% bootstrap) for the sister relationship of Daucus with Panax in
the euasterid II clade. These results provide the best taxon
sampling of complete chloroplast genomes and the
strongest support yet for the sister relationship of Caryophyllales to the asterids.
The availability of the complete plastid genome sequence
should facilitate improved transformation efficiency and
foreign gene expression in carrot through utilization of
endogenous flanking sequences and regulatory elements.
The ability to express high levels of foreign protein, particularly those of clinical interest, makes plant plastids an
attractive target for biotechnology. As a biennial crop
which is amenable to relatively long term storage, carrot
taproots may provide a feasible platform for the production of pharmaceutical proteins for oral delivery. The
availability of the complete plastid genome sequence
should facilitate improved transformation efficiency and
foreign gene expression in carrot through utilization of
endogenous flanking sequences and regulatory elements.

Methods
DNA isolation and amplification
Daucus carota L. cv half long plants were purchased fresh
from a local market with leaves intact. Leaf tissue (10 g)
was collected for plastid isolation based on the sucrose
step gradient centrifugation method of Palmer [83]. Isolation was followed by whole plastid genome Rolling Circle
Amplification (RCA) using the Repli-g RCA kit (Qiagen,
Inc.) following the methods outlined in [84]. After incubation at 30°C for 16 hr, the reaction was terminated with
10-minute incubation at 65°C. Digestion of the RCA
product with BstXI, EcoRI and HindIII allowed verification
of successful RCA amplification of the plastome, as well as
assessment of its quality prior to genome sequencing.
DNA sequencing and genome assembly
DNA was sheared by nebulization, size fractionated to 4–
6 kb, linker ligated and cloned into pHOS2, a TIGR
medium copy vector. A total of 1231 high quality reads

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:222

with an average length of 808 bases was generated during
the random (1126 reads) and closure (105 reads) phases
of sequencing. Sequences were assembled using TIGR
assembler [85] and scaffolded using Bambus [86].
Sequence finishing included directed PCR to span gaps
and directed primer walking of clones to cover the entire
genome and to complete regions of low depth of coverage.
Annotation and analysis of repeat structure
The Daucus carota plastid genome was annotated using
DOGMA [87], which performs BLASTX searches against a
custom database of previously published plastid genomes
to identify putative coding sequences. The user submits a
FASTA-formatted input file of the complete plastid
genome sequence for analysis. DOGMA identified putative start and stop codons, which must then be confirmed
by the user for each putative protein-coding gene. Identification of intron and exon boundaries and tRNAs and
rRNAs must also be confirmed. The fully annotated plastid genome of Daucus carota was submitted to NCBI GenBank
with
the
following
accession
number
[GenBank:DQ898156].

Analysis of repeat structure was carried out using Comparative Repeat Analysis (CRA) [88]. The settings for identifying direct and inverted (palindromic) repeats included a
size range between 30–5000 bp and a Hamming distance
of 3 (limiting hits to sequence identity of ≥ 90%).
Phylogenetic analysis
The 61 genes included in the analyses of Goremykin et al.
[47], Leebens-Mack et al. [49], Lee et al. [36], and Jansen
et al. [35] were extracted from the plastid genome
sequence of Daucus using the DOGMA [87]. The same set
of 61 genes was extracted from plastid genome sequences
of 30 other sequenced plastid genomes (see Table 3 for
complete list of genomes examined). All 61 protein-coding genes of the 31 taxa were translated into amino acid
sequences, aligned using MUSCLE [89] followed by manual adjustments, and then nucleotide sequences of these
genes were aligned by constraining them to the aligned
amino acid sequences. A Nexus file with character sets for
phylogenetic analyses was generated after nucleotide
sequence alignment was completed. The complete nucleotide alignment is available online at Chloroplast
Genome Database [90].

Phylogenetic analyses using maximum parsimony (MP)
and maximum likelihood (ML) were performed with
PAUP* version 4.10b10 [91]. Phylogenetic analyses
excluded gap regions to avoid alignment ambiguities in
regions with variation in sequence lengths. All MP
searches included 100 random addition replicates and
TBR branch swapping with the Multrees option. Model-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/222

test 3.7 [92] was used to determine the most appropriate
model of DNA sequence evolution for the combined 61gene dataset. Hierarchical likelihood ratio tests and the
Akaike information criterion were used to assess which of
the 56 models best fit the data, which was determined to
be GTR + I + Γ by both criteria. For ML analyses we performed an initial parsimony search with 100 random
addition sequence replicates and TBR branch swapping,
which resulted in a single tree. Model parameters were
optimized onto the parsimony tree. We fixed these parameters and performed a ML analysis with three random
addition sequence replicates and TBR branch swapping.
The resulting ML tree was used to re-optimize model
parameters, which then were fixed for another ML search
with three random addition sequence replicates and TBR
branch swapping. This successive approximation procedure was repeated until the same tree topology and model
parameters were recovered in multiple, consecutive iterations. This tree was accepted as the final ML tree (Fig. 3).
Successive approximation has been shown to perform as
well as full-optimization analyses for a number of empirical and simulated datasets [93]. Non-parametric bootstrap analyses [94] were performed for MP analyses with
1000 replicates with TBR branch swapping, 1 random
addition replicate, and the Multrees option and for ML
analyses with 100 replicates with NNI branch swapping, 1
random addition replicate, and the Multrees option.
