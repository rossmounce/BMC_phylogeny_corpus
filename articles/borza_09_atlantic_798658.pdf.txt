Abstract
Background: Hemoglobin (Hb) polymorphism, assessed by protein gel electrophoresis, has been used
almost exclusively to characterize the genetic structure of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) populations and to
establish correlations with phenotypic traits such as Hb oxygen binding capacity, temperature tolerance
and growth characteristics. The genetic system used to explain the results of gel electrophoresis entails
the presence of one polymorphic locus with two major alleles (HbI-1; HbI-2). However, vertebrates have
more than one gene encoding Hbs and recent studies have reported that more than one Hb gene is
present in Atlantic cod. These observations prompted us to re-evaluate the number of Hb genes
expressed in Atlantic cod, and to perform an in depth search for polymorphisms that might produce
relevant phenotypes for breeding programs.
Results: Analysis of Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) led to the identification of nine distinct Hb
transcripts; four corresponding to the  Hb gene family and five to the  Hb gene family. To gain insights
about the Hb genes encoding these transcripts, genomic sequence data was generated from heterozygous
(HbI-1/2) parents and fifteen progeny; five of each HbI type, i.e., HbI-1/1, HbI-1/2 and HbI-2/2.  Hb genes
displayed more polymorphism than  Hb genes. Two major allele types (1A and 1B) that differ by two
linked non-synonymous substitutions (Met55Val and Lys62Ala) were found in the 1 Hb gene, and the
distribution of these 1A and 1B alleles among individuals was congruent with that of the HbI-1 and HbI2 alleles determined by protein gel electrophoresis. RT-PCR and Q-PCR analysis of the nine Hb genes
indicates that all genes are expressed in adult fish, but their level of expression varies greatly; higher
expression of almost all Hb genes was found in individuals displaying the HbI-2/2 electrophoretic type.
Conclusion: This study indicates that more Hb genes are present and expressed in adult Atlantic cod
than previously documented. Our finding that nine Hb genes are expressed simultaneously in adult fish
suggests that Atlantic cod, similarly to fish such as rainbow trout, carp, and goldfish, might be able to
respond to environmental challenges such as chronic hypoxia or long-term changes in temperature by
altering the level of expression of these genes. In this context, the role of the non-conservative substitution
Lys62Ala found in the 1 Hb gene, which appears to explain the occurrence of the HbI-1 and HbI-2 alleles
described by gel electrophoresis, and which was found to be present in other fish such as eel, emerald
rockcod, rainbow trout and moray, requires further investigation.

Background
Hemoglobin (Hb) polymorphisms, identified by means
of protein gel electrophoresis, have been used for decades
to assess the genetic structure of populations, to establish
relationships between genotypes and phenotypes, and to
understand the molecular bases of genetic diseases [1-3].
The Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) represents one of the
most valuable commercial resources for fisheries in the
northern Atlantic, contributing to the cultural identity of
people living in the costal areas of Atlantic Canada, Iceland and Northern Europe. In recent years, due to decline
in the worldwide catch and to the increase in the retail
price, Atlantic cod has become an attractive species for
aquaculture [4-6]. As a result of its economic importance,
many studies have investigated the relationship between
the Hb types revealed by protein electrophoresis and phenotypic traits such as Hb oxygen binding capacity, temperature tolerance and growth characteristics. Almost five
decades ago, Sick [7] demonstrated that Atlantic cod Hbs
can be separated by agar gel electrophoresis into two main
components, HbI and HbII, the first component showing
three different variants, HbI-1/1, HbI-1/2 and HbI-2/2.
The genetic model put forward to explain these polymorphisms was a two-allele system, with subsequent studies
suggesting that the distribution of Hb alleles in Atlantic
cod populations is strongly influenced by water temperature; the HbI-1 allele is dominant in warmer regions
(North Sea, southern part of the Norwegian Sea, western
part of the Baltic Sea and around the British Isles), while
allele HbI-2 is predominantly found in colder waters
(Greenland, Iceland, Canada, northern Norway and the
northern part of the Baltic Sea) [8-10]. North-south clines
in HbI allele frequencies were identified in the eastern
North Atlantic [3,8-11]. However, the existence of these
clines in the western North Atlantic was less conspicuous
[3,11,12]. Karpov and Novikov [13] provided a possible
physiological basis for this distribution by showing that
the temperature effect on in vitro hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curves differed substantially between the three
common HbI genotypes, a finding supported by other,
more recent, studies [14,15]. These studies show that the
affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is higher for HbI-2/2
individuals at low temperatures (<10°C) [13-15], that
hemoglobin-oxygen binding affinity becomes greater for
HbI-1/1 individuals at high temperatures (>14°C) [1315] and that the heterozygous hemoglobin type has oxygen affinity values that are intermediate between HbI-1/1
and HbI-2/2 [13]. There are many other reports on the
apparent selection effects on the HbI types, including the
age and seasonality of sexual maturation [16], annual
mortality [17], haematocrit [18] and number and diameter of muscle fibers [19]. Further, it is apparent that hemoglobin components undergo changes during ontogeny
and in response to various stimuli. For instance, Hb elec-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/51

trophoresis indicates that in juveniles the apparently
monomorphic HbII components are more visible than
HbI while in adult fish the main components are represented by the polymorphic HbI [20]. Also, acclimation to
lower (4 and 8°C) and higher (12 and 15°C) temperatures favours the expression of more anodic and cathodic
hemoglobin components, respectively [14].
However, research on Atlantic cod hemoglobin polymorphism has not always produced results that are consistent
with the apparent relationship between water temperature
and hemoglobin-oxygen binding characteristics. For
example, while Petersen and Steffensen [15] showed that
hemoglobin genotype correlated well with temperature
preference (juvenile HbI-2/2 Atlantic cod preferring a
temperature of 8.2°C while HbI-1/1 preferred 15.4°C),
Gamperl et al. [21] were unable to demonstrate that upper
temperature or hypoxia tolerance differed between hemoglobin genotypes when acutely exposed to these environmental challenges. In addition, although most growth
studies show that HbI-2/2 Atlantic cod have the highest
overall growth of the three Hb types [22,23], and that
temperature-related differences in growth among genotypes are photoperiod dependent [24], the temperature at
which Atlantic cod of all three variants was reported to be
growing best varies widely between studies, e.g., 12°C
[14], 14°C [25] or between 12.5°C and 14.5°C [23]. Discrepancies among the results of these studies might be due
to the fact that protein electrophoresis largely underestimates genetic variability [26] and that many polymorphisms present in Hb molecules are not detected using
this method. Moreover, the heterotetrameric hemoglobin
molecule of fish consists of two -globin subunits and
two -globin subunits that are encoded by different genes,
most of them being polymorphic [27,28], as seen in other
vertebrates. Indeed, more Hb variants have been
described in Atlantic cod after using more refined methods such as protein isoelectrofocusing [14,29], Hb purification by chromatography followed by amino acid
sequencing [30], and the characterization of hemoglobin
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using limited
sequence information [31]. However, no in depth
genomic studies of the Hb genes that are expressed in
Atlantic cod have been performed to date.
Canadian and Norwegian Atlantic cod genomics projects
have generated a large amount of sequence data [[6], Bowman et al, in prep]. The Cod Genomics and Broodstock
Development Project (CGP) recently produced 158,877
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) [Bowman et al, in prep]
using a large number of individuals and a variety of cDNA
libraries, including several blood, embryonic and larval
cDNA libraries. We decided to use this information to: 1)
to determine how many different Hb transcripts are
present in Atlantic cod; 2) find out if specific Hb tran-

scripts are expressed in discrete developmental stages and
3) uncover polymorphisms present in the Hb transcripts.
To gain more information about the Hb genes present in
Atlantic cod we also generated genomic sequence data
from fifteen individuals, five of each HbI type, i.e., HbI-1/
1, HbI-1/2 and HbI-2/2, from a family produced by crossing heterozygous parents (both HbI-1/2), and determined
the expression of individual Hb genes by quantitative PCR
(Q-PCR).

Results
Identification of different Hb transcripts
The search performed in the CGP database http://
www.codgene.ca, which comprises 160,228 Atlantic cod
ESTs, led to the identification of several clusters annotated
by AutoFact [32] as corresponding to Hb sequences. The
ESTs from these clusters were pooled with homologous
EST sequences retrieved from GenBank databases and reclustered. TBLASTX search in GenBank (survey performed
in June, 2008) revealed that approximately 1% of the
186,753 Atlantic cod ESTs deposited in GenBank by CGP
and other submitters correspond to different Hb transcripts. The final clustering of these ESTs produced 4 like and 5 -like unique sequences (contigs). Multiple
polymorphisms were evident in the contigs that resulted
from clustering the  Hb ESTs, suggesting that some of
these contigs might contain ESTs that are the product of
more than one gene, or that they correspond to multiple
alleles of the same gene.
Genomic data for the Atlantic cod Hb genes
To gain more information about the Hb genes present in
Atlantic cod and about the polymorphisms associated
with these genes, genomic data was produced by sequencing amplicons generated by PCR from five individuals of
each Hb type, i.e., HbI-1/1, HbI-1/2, and HbI-2/2, and
from their heterozygous parents (HbI-1/2)(for more
details on this family see the Methods section). Good
quality sequence data was obtained for the four  Hb
genes; in contrast, high quality data was obtained only for
two (Hb 2 and 5) of the five  Hb genes found in Atlantic cod. The chromatograms resulting from the sequencing
of the Hb genes 1, 3 and 4 were of poor quality or difficult to decipher. Analysis of these chromatograms
revealed numerous frame-shifting indels in intronic
sequences, as well as a large number of SNPs, suggesting
the presence of more than one allele/locus in each individual analysed. For this reason, the PCR products of these
 Hb genes had to be cloned before sequencing.

Atlantic cod Hb genes show an archetypal structure for
Hbs, having three exons and two introns. All introns display a standard GT-AC structure at the exon-intron junction and their position in the coding regions is rather
similar; however, the length of introns varies from gene to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/51

gene. Exceptionally long introns were found in the 3 Hb
gene (568 nt and 794 nt for intron 1 and 2, respectively)
while intron 2 of the 1 Hb gene contains a GT module
repeated up to 60 times.
Atlantic cod 1-4, 2 and 5 Hb genes, analysed by direct
sequencing of PCR products, show little or no
polymorphism in their coding sequence
However, apart from the 2 Hb gene (FJ666966), which
appears to be monomorphic, all the other  Hb genes display substitutions or indels affecting intronic sequences.
In the 1 Hb gene, two linked SNPs have been identified
in intron 1, yielding two alleles (GenBank acc. # FJ666964
and FJ666965). Analysis of the 3 Hb gene revealed two
SNPs in intron 2 producing 3 alleles, i.e. allele 1, 1165C/
1185A (FJ666967), allele 2, 1165C/1185T (FJ666968),
and allele 3, 1165T/1185T (FJ666969), respectively. In
addition to these polymorphisms and large intronic
sequences, this gene has other peculiar features: it encodes
a polypeptide that is only 141 amino acids long while
most  Hb genes in fish and other vertebrates encode
products consisting of 143 amino acids, and, relative to
the other Atlantic cod  Hb sequences, it shows less
sequence conservation. Finally, two alleles (FJ666970 and
FJ666971) were identified following the analysis of several 4 Hb sequences; the difference between the two alleles is a three nucleotide indel in intron 2.

The 2 (FJ666980 and FJ666981) and 5 Hb genes
(FJ666989 and FJ66690), for which genomic data was
obtained by sequencing PCR products, showed low levels
of polymorphism when compared to other Atlantic cod 
Hb genes. The polymorphisms found in 2 and in 5 Hb
genes consisted of a SNP located in exon 2 resulting in a
non-synonymous substitution, and a SNP located in
intron 2, respectively. The distribution of these  and 
Hb alleles within the family analysed in this study is summarized in Table 1.
Analysis of 1, 3 and 4 Hb genes was performed using
cloned PCR products as results indicated that frameshifting polymorphisms were present in these genes
Analysis of the cloned products of the 1 Hb gene
revealed multiple SNPs at synonymous sites and three
SNPs at non-synonymous sites, as well as many SNPs and
indels in intronic sequences, indicating that four alleles
for this gene were present in this family, and that both
progeny and parents were heterozygotes (Table 1 and
Additional file 1). The identification of two non-synonymous substitutions Met55Val and Lys62Ala, linked to several distinct silent substitutions, suggested the presence of
two main allele types (haplotypes), 1A and 1B (1A Met55/Lys62 and 1B - Val55/Ala62). Each of these main
allele types appear to be represented by two subtypes, i.e.,
1A1, 1A2 and 1B1, 1B2, respectively, which differ

Note: The HbI phenotype was determined by Hb electrophoresis on agar gels and by IEF, while genomic data was obtained from sequencing the
nine Hb genes. Transcript sequence data was produced only for the 1, 3 and 4 Hb genes. GenBank accession numbers for these genes/alleles
are FJ666964 to FJ666990. M, monomorphic locus; -, data not available/not determined

from each other by exhibiting dissimilar polymorphisms
at synonymous sites and intronic sequences. The third
non-synonymous substitution, Leu123Met, occurs only
in the main 1B allele type (1B1 Met123, and 1B2
Leu123)(FJ666974 and FJ666975, respectively) while the
1A type shows no polymorphism at this position; i.e.
1A alleles retain a Leu in position 123 (FJ666972 and
FJ666973). A small number of cloned 1 Hb sequences
(FJ666976-FJ666979), identified in both parents and
progeny, suggest that some additional 1-like sequences
might be present in Atlantic cod and that these sequences
likely occurred by gene rearrangements involving exon
and/or intron shuffling among alleles (Additional file 1).
The distribution of these 1A and 1B alleles among individuals was congruent with that of the HbI alleles determined by Hb gel electrophoresis: i.e the HbI-1/1
individuals displayed only alleles of the main 1A type,
the HbI-1/2 individuals alleles of the both types, and the
HbI-2/2 individuals alleles of the 1B type (Table 1).
The data for the 3 and 4 Hb genes was acquired using
the same pair of primers (Additional file 2), since the EST
data we used for primer design did not allow us to determine whether polymorphisms originated from one locus
with multiple alleles or from duplicated loci. Genomic
sequence data revealed 12 SNPs and an indel of 4 nucleotides in intron 1, and indicated the presence of 7 distinct
alleles in progeny and parents. Phylogenetic study of these
alleles (data not shown), together with genotyping analysis of four of these SNPs (Additional file 3) on a large
number of individuals from different populations (data

not shown), also gave evidence that at least two different
loci are required to encode these alleles. The two Hb genes
were labelled 3 and 4, with 3 and 4 alleles, respectively
(Table 1 and Additional file 3). The sequencing of more
clones from every individual and of RT-PCR products, as
well as Q-PCR experiments conducted with 3- and 4specific primers (Figure 1, Table 1 and Additional files 3,
4 and 5), provided additional support for this hypothesis.
RT-PCR experiments demonstrate that all nine Hb genes
are expressed in adult fish
RT-PCR products were obtained for all Hb genes identified in Atlantic cod after 35 cycles of amplification using
the total RNA isolated from progeny of the three different
HbI types. No information about allele-specific expression could be obtained for the  Hb genes and for 5 as
the polymorphisms identified in these genes are located
in intronic sequences. To determine if all of the alleles
found in the 1-4 genes are expressed, we sequenced the
RT-PCR products generated from the progeny. Transcripts
corresponding to all 2-4 Hb alleles were identified,
while the 1 Hb gene data indicated that four alleles are
expressed (the sequences corresponding to the GenBank
entries FJ666972 to FJ666975). Evidence for a recombinant transcript corresponding to GenBank FJ666976
(Additional file 1), could not be found.
Q-PCR analysis indicates gene- and HbI type-specific
expression
Q-PCR experiments were performed using the same samples employed in the RT-PCR experiments used for

sequencing, and with Q-PCR gene-specific primers (Additional file 4). Large differences were found when expression data from 1 and 2 Hb genes was compared with
that observed for the 3 and 4 Hb genes; the former
genes exhibited 10 to 100 fold higher expression (Figure
1, Additional file 5). Similar results where found when the
expression data for the 1-4 Hb genes was compared
with that of 5. Analysis of data coming from the three
HbI (HbI-1/1, HbI-1/2 and HbI-2/2) types showed a
strong bias in expression among these HbI types, with 2/
2 individuals consistently showing increased expression
of 1-3 and 1-4 Hb genes relative to the other two HbI
types (Figure 1, Additional file 5).

Abundance of the different types of Hb transcripts in EST
databases
We searched the CGP and GenBank databases to gain
information on the relative number of ESTs corresponding to the various genes and to the alleles/SNPs identified
by our sequencing of the 15 progeny and their parents.
The highest number of ESTs was found to match the 1
and 2 Hb genes, followed by 1B and 2 while the lowest number of ESTs was found to correspond to the 4 and
4 Hb genes (Table 2). These results are similar to data
obtained by Q-PCR, with the exception of a strong bias in
the relative number of ESTs matching the two main alleles
identified to be present at the 1 locus: the allele 1B was
represented by ten times more ESTs than allele 1A. This
difference, however, is likely to be the consequence of a
sampling bias, as most fish used to generate EST data in
our CGP laboratory had the HbI 2/2 type and, therefore,
it is likely that they harboured only the 1B allele. In addition, all the ESTs corresponding to the 4 Hb gene were
found to originate from a larval cDNA library, suggesting
that this gene is expressed at higher levels at this developmental stage.
Amino acid-based phylogenetic analysis of Atlantic cod
hemoglobins
Phylogenetic analysis of Atlantic cod Hb genes (Additional files 6 and 7) was performed using many of the teleost sequences used in other studies [30,33]; this rationale
was chosen in order to maintain the same general tree
topology and the main Hb groups [33]. Phylogeny of the
 Hbs resolved several clades; with the exception of three
sequences that form a strongly supported group which
was named "short"  Hbs, these clades were tentatively
assigned to the four Hb groups suggested by Maruyama et
al [33](Figure 2). The "short"  Hbs group includes the

Note: TBLASTN search against GenBank EST_others dataset (Gadus morhua, taxid: 8049) was performed using the entire amino acid Hb sequence
or with sequences 21 amino acids long: e.g. ten amino acids on each side of the polymorphic site. The search performed with the sequences 21
amino acids long was carried out in order to find ESTs associated with a particular polymorphism.

Atlantic cod 3 Hb and consists of  Hbs that encode
products that are only 141 amino acids in length. A
"short"  Hb sequence was reported previously in adult
medaka (Oryzias latipes) and was labelled as "unique"
[33]. However, this is the first instance where phylogeny
revealed that these sequences form a distinct, highly divergent group of fish Hbs. In agreement with their expression
pattern, Atlantic cod 1 and 2 Hb sequences clustered
with other Hbs that are expressed in adult fish [30], while
4 showed affinities with Hbs demonstrated to be
expressed in embryonic stages [34]. Phylogeny of the 
Hbs showed that Atlantic cod 1-4 Hbs have affinities
with other  Hbs expressed in adult gadids [30], while
Atlantic cod 5 Hb clusters with other embryonic teleost
sequences [33,34](Figure 3).

Discussion
Gene number and sequence conservation in Atlantic cod
hemoglobin
The primers used to amplify the Hb genes were designed
based on the data derived from ESTs; therefore, our results
are restricted to genes that are expressed in Atlantic cod.
We cannot formally rule out that other Hb genes may also
be expressed in Atlantic cod; however, taking into account
the depth of our EST sequencing from various cDNA
libraries, including different developmental stages such as
embryonic and larval, the expression of Hb genes not
detected here should be extremely low. Further studies,
including sequencing of the Hb genomic loci, are required
to determine the precise number of Hb genes present in
Atlantic cod and their genomic context, and to reveal if,
similar to other fish in which these loci are well characterized [27,35], Hb loci in Atlantic cod contain genes that are
not expressed (i.e. pseudogenes).

Our study expands the number of Hb transcripts
described in Atlantic cod from six [31] to nine, and suggests that the number of Hb heterotetramers present in
Atlantic cod, resulting from the combination of the various  and  chains, should be higher than two (the
number suggested by agar electrophoresis [7,9,10]) or
three (the number suggested recently by Verde and al.
[30]). This finding is similar to that of the rainbow trout
(Oncorhynchus mykiss) Hb system, which was considered
for decades to consist of four components [34,36-38].
Similar to Atlantic cod, the electrophoretic or chromatographic separation of rainbow trout Hbs allowed for the
identification of several components that can be adult- or
embryo/alevin-specific [34]. Functionally, the major fractions HbI and HbIV, which exhibit cathodic and anodic
migration upon electrophoretic separation, show radically different oxygen binding properties and pH sensitivity [38-40]. Several studies including crystal structures

chains were present in HbI and HbIV, respectively. How-

ever, the separation of trout hemolysate by chromatography followed by amino acid sequencing and mass
spectrometry analysis allowed for the identification of
nine different alpha and beta chains in these major fractions, and showed that the major rainbow trout Hb components represent a mixture of isoHbs that are made up of
more than one alpha and beta chain [41]. Other fish such
as carp (Cyprinus carpio)[42], goldfish (Carassius auratus)
[43], medaka [33,35] zebrafish (Danio rerio) [44,45] and
pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis) [46] have multiple  and
 genes, and multiple Hb components. Thus, the emerging picture is that the subunit composition of Hbs in
many fish is more diverse than previously documented.
Sequence conservation between 2-4 genes suggests
recent duplications
The search for Hb sequences in fish such as medaka,
zebrafish and pufferfish, for which extensive genomic
data exists, indicates that these taxa posses multiple  and
 genes [33,35,44-46]. In some cases these genes are
highly similar in both their coding and non-coding
regions; for example the alpha 0 and 1 genes from medaka
[33,35]. In most cases however, exons show more
sequence conservation than introns, with the 5' and 3'
untranscribed regions (UTRs) being responsible for most
of the sequence divergence among Hb genes. The exons of
2 and 3-4 Atlantic cod Hb genes show little differentiation, but both introns and UTR sequences are clearly
divergent between genes, with the most marked variation
occuring in intron 2, which is 213 nucleotides shorter in
3-4 Hb genes. When 3 and 4 Hb genes were compared, apart from a small number of SNPs that were
detected in exons and introns, but not in the 5' and 3' UTR
sequences, and a 4 nt deletion in intron 1 of 4 relative to
the 3 gene, no other differences were observed. However,
based on the fact that we identified 7 alleles upon
sequencing 27 cloned PCR products from parents and 15
progeny (Additional file 3), and on the segregation patterns of the 4 SNPs that were used in the genotyping of
more than 1000 fish (our unpublished data), it is clear
that at least two different genes encode these sequences.
Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the duplication of 24 Hb genes occurred relatively recently within gadids
(Figure 3), and suggests that other  genes might be
present in Arctic cod (Arctogadus glacialis) and polar cod
(Boreogadus saida), two close relatives of G. morhua.
The 1 Hb gene displays two major allele types correlating
with HbI-1 and HbI-2, together with several additional
polymorphisms
The 1A and 1B alleles are highly differentiated at both,
the nucleotide level (differing by 18 SNPs and multiple
indels) and the amino acid level (two amino acids different between 1A alleles and 1B1 and three amino acids
between 1A alleles and 1B2). The difference between

the two 1A alleles that are expressed affect only 4 sites
while 8 sites are variable between the two 1B alleles
(Additional file 1). The search of GenBank EST data indicated that while positions 55 and 62 are always linked
(i.e. the 1A alleles are always Met55/Lys62 and 1B alleles are Val55/Ala62) the third non-synonymous substitution, Leu123Met can be present in one or the other major
allele types. Large-scale sampling of different populations
using the GoldenGate genotyping assay that included
position 123 also indicated that the non-synonymous
substitution Leu123Met is not linked to the polymorphisms present in position 55 and 62 (data not shown).
In a paper published at the time this manuscript was
drafted, using a SNP assay, Andersen et al [31] analysed
the distribution of the substitutions Met55/Lys62 and
Val55/Ala62 in Atlantic cod populations from Norwegian
coast, Danish waters and western Baltic Sea. Based on statistical analysis they concluded that positions 55 and 62
are strongly linked; in contrast to our approach that comprised whole gene sequencing, their study was restricted
to the analysis of these two non-synonymous substitutions that were assayed separately by mass spectrometry
[31].
Is the substitution Lys62Ala unique to Atlantic cod?
Our finding that the polymorphism at the HbI locus correlates well with the non-conservative substitution
Lys62Ala in the 1 Hb gene is further supported by the
observation that almost all of the 1 ESTs produced by the
CGP correspond to the haplotype 1B (Met55/Lys62)
while the Norwegian sequencing project yielded a large
number of ESTs matching the haplotype 1A (Val55/
Ala62); these results are in agreement with the geographical distribution of the electrophoretic types HbI-2 and
HbI-1. Andersen et al. [31] suggested that the substitution
Met55Val might have an effect on the stability of the 11
heterodimer, while the substitution Lys62Ala might
explain the differences in temperature-dependent oxygen
affinity documented for HbI-1/1, HbI-1/2 and HbI-2/2
Atlantic cod using isolated erythrocytes or hemolysates.
Clearly, the effects of the substitution Met55Val at the 
interface are hard to predict in the absence of a crystal
structure of Atlantic cod Hb, as structure-function analyses of hemoglobins are notoriously difficult [47]. However, the substitution Lys62Ala is located next to the
highly conserved His63, which plays a key role in controlling the access of ligands to the heme pocket, and thus is
likely to have significant effects. As a more reliable inference cannot be achieved in the absence of a crystal structure for Atlantic cod Hbs, we decided to see if Hbs from
other fish display a similar substitution. Indeed, our
search in GenBank indicates that other fish, such as rainbow trout, eel (Anguilla anguilla), emerald rockcod (Trematomus bernacchii) and moray (Murena helena) have  Hb
genes that display the same polymorphism, Lys/Ala, in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/51

position 62 (Figure 4). Notably, while the Lys62Ala substitution in Atlantic cod is related to a genetic system consisting of 2 major alleles/one gene, in rainbow trout these
polymorphisms are associated with two genes expressed
in juveniles, and with a further two genes expressed in
adult fish [34]. Overall, as this substitution is present in
other fish it is likely to play a significant role in the biology of Atlantic cod Hbs. However, more studies are
needed to determine if any of the additional polymorphisms linked with the 1 Hb alleles can explain why the
genotypes described by Hb electrophoresis do not always
correlate with phenotypic traits such as acute temperature/hypoxia tolerance [21] or growth characteristics
[23,24].
Concerted changes in the expression of several Hb genes
might also be involved in thermal stress/hypoxia responses
Fish having multiple hemoglobin types, such as rainbow
trout [39,41,48], carp [42] and goldfish [43], have been
shown to alter the relative ratio of anodic to cathodic Hb
components over time. This form of acclimation is correlated with changes in temperature, and has been reported
in response to seasonal, diurnal, and random temperature
cycles [43,48]. In addition, goldfish have the ability to
assemble an extra Hb molecule by recombining dimers
from existing components [42,43,48]. Given that acclimation of Atlantic cod to different temperatures results in
changes in the expression of anodic vs. cathodic components (low temperatures favouring the expression of more
anodic hemoglobin components, whereas acclimation to
higher temperatures favours the expression of more
cathodic/less anodic components [14]), that the ratio of
cathodic to anodic hemoglobin components changes during ontogeny [20] and the plethora of Hb genes that are
differentially expressed in adult fish of the three hemoglobin genotypes (this study), we suggest that: 1) temperature and hypoxia tolerance may not be entirely
dependent on the expression of one or the other major 1
allele types as suggested recently [31]; 2) in the early stages
of Atlantic cod development Hb genes other than 1 are
likely to be preferentially expressed.

Conclusion
This study indicates that more Hb genes are present and
expressed in adult Atlantic cod than previously documented by using protein gel electrophoresis or protein
sequencing. Thus, the emerging picture is that the subunit
composition of Atlantic cod Hbs is more diverse than
indicated by Verde et al. [30]; this finding suggests that in
depth structure-function studies of the various Atlantic
cod Hbs are needed to better understand their functional
characteristics. The high number of polymorphisms, identified by sequencing the nine Hb genes and their transcripts, suggests that population studies of Atlantic cod
employing Hb protein electrophoresis largely underesti-

Alignment of the five Atlantic cod  Hbs and of the  Hbs from rainbow trout (O. mykiss), eel (A. anguilla) and
emerald rockcod (T. bernacchii) displaying the substitution Lys62Ala. In Atlantic cod, the two major alleles 1A and
1B display in position 62 the amino acids Lys (K) and Ala (A), respectively. In the other Atlantic cod Hbs position 62 is occupied by Ala (2-4 Hbs) or Asn (N; 5 Hb). The other non-conservative substitution identified in the 1 chain of Atlantic cod,
Met55Val, seems to have a distribution restricted to this species.
mated the level of polymorphisms present at Hb loci.
Expression data indicates that the major Hb genes
expressed in adult fish are 1-2 and 1-4 while EST distribution restricted to a larval cDNA library, Q-PCR and
phylogenetic analysis suggest that the 4 Hb gene can be
regarded as an embryonic/larval Hb that is likely transcribed in larger quantities during early stages of development and at low levels in adult fish; these characteristics
also seem to apply to the 5 Hb gene. The function and
timing of expression of 3 Hb remains elusive as this gene
belongs to an uncharacterized group of fish  Hbs that are
unique in encoding only 141 amino acids, two amino
acids less than the other  Hbs described in vertebrates.
The high number of Hb genes expressed simultaneously
in adult Atlantic cod suggests that the response to environmental challenges such as hypoxia and temperature
change might be achieved by modulating their expression.
In this context, the relative importance of the non-conservative substitutions Met55Val and Lys62Ala found in
1 Hb gene, which seems to explain the occurrence of the
HbI-1 and HbI-2 alleles described by gel electrophoresis,

needs to be explored in relation to the many additional
Hb genes and alleles, and in regard to expression
responses to environmental stimuli. Moreover, the fact
that we discovered that fish such as rainbow trout, eel,
emerald rockcod, and moray, have  Hb genes that display the same polymorphism, Lys/Ala, in position 62 but
which function as part of a different genetic system, i.e.
two genes and not two major alleles/one gene as in Atlantic cod, indicate a convergent evolution related to functional characteristics whose importance is waiting to be
deciphered.

Methods
Identification of Atlantic cod hemoglobin transcripts in
databases
The identification of hemoglobin (Hb) genes expressed in
Atlantic cod was carried out by analysing the EST data produced by the CGP (see: http://www.codgene.ca), and EST
data deposited in GenBank by CGP and other groups (see:
http://www.codgen.olsvik.info). Identification of Hb
transcripts in the CGP database was achieved using keyword searches of data automatically annotated by Auto-

Fact [32] while the search in GenBank was performed by
running a BLAST search with Hb sequences retrieved from
the CGP database.
Experimental fish
A single family of Atlantic cod consisting of all three
hemoglobin types (HbI-1/1, HbI-2/2 and HbI-1/2) identified using agar gel electrophoresis [7], was produced by
crossing heterozygous parents (HbI-1/2)*(HbI-1/2). The
progeny were produced by strip spawning parents (wild
caught from Cape Sable; 43 20' 04", 65 40 ' 45") at the St.
Andrews Biological Station (St. Andrews New Brunswick)
in December 2005. Approximately 800 juveniles were
transported to the Dr. Joe Brown Aquaculture Research
Building (JBARB) at the Ocean Sciences Centre of Memorial University of Newfoundland. At the JBARB, the fish
were kept until the beginning of November 2007 when fin
clips and blood samples were collected.
Fin clip DNA isolation and sequencing of Hb genes
Fin clip DNA from five individuals of each hemoglobin
type was isolated using the Gentra Puregene DNA isolation procedure (Qiagen, Burlington, ON, Canada). PCR
primers were designed based on EST data (Additional file
2). The initial sequencing was performed from PCR
amplicons. Good quality sequence data was obtained for
the four  Hb genes and for 5, but for 1-4 Hb genes
most chromatograms were of poor quality or unreadable.
To overcome this problem, the PCR products of 1-4 Hb
genes were gel purified, extracted using the Qiagen Gel
Extraction kit (Qiagen, Burlington, ON, Canada) and
cloned in pCR®2.1-TOPO® using the TOPO TA cloning kit
(Invitrogen, Burlington, ON, Canada). The sequence from
two or more clones from each gene and individual was
determined using M13 forward and reverse primers.
Sequencing was performed at The Atlantic Genome Centre (TAGC, Halifax, NS, Canada) using the MegaBace platform (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA)
and at Macrogen (Macrogen USA, Rockville, MD).
Sample preparation for protein and RNA isolation
Blood samples from 15 individuals (5 from each of the
three hemoglobin types) were collected in heparinized
tubes and red blood cells (RBCs) were separated from
plasma by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 1 minute. Twothirds of the pelleted RBCs were stored at -80°C and used
for protein electrophoresis, while remainder of the pellet
was resuspended in RNAlater (Ambion/Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX, USA) at a ratio 1:5 and used for RNA
extraction.
Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR)
Total RNA was extracted from RBCs resuspended in
RNAlater using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc.). RNA
quality was assessed by separating samples on 1% native

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/10/51

agarose gels. One step RT-PCR was performed using
Ambion's RETROscript kit following the manufacturer's
instructions. The primers used to distinguish among the
various hemoglobin genes are listed in Additional file 2.
Sequencing of the RT-PCR products was performed at
Macrogen (Macrogen USA, Rockville, MD).
Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain
reaction (Q-PCR)
Expression levels of the nine Hb genes were analysed by
quantitative PCR using Fast SYBR Green® and the StepOne
Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). For Q-PCR studies, we used 2-3 individuals of each
Hb electrophoretic phenotype. The primer sequence used
for gene expression analysis is presented in Additional file
4. Primers were first tested by PCR, using genomic DNA to
make sure that only one size product was obtained; the
amplicons were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and
stained with ethidium bromide. In addition, following QPCR amplification, melt-curves (0.3°C from 50°C to
95°C) were used to verify that a single amplicon was
obtained and no primer-dimer products were present. QPCR was performed in a 20 l reaction volume using 20
ng of cDNA, 1 uL 4 M each of forward and reverse primers and 10 uL 2× Fast SYBR Green® Master Mix. Expression
levels of hemoglobin genes were normalized to the ubiquitin gene. The decision to use ubiquitin as our endogenous control was based on experimentation we had
conducted comparing several housekeeping genes and on
supporting literature [49,50]. Cycling parameters consisted of one denaturing cycle of 95°C for 2 min., followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec. and 60°C for 1
minute. Cycled 48 well-plates contained target genes and
the endogenous control in duplicate. The fluorescence
threshold cycle (CT) was determined automatically using
StepOne software (version 2.0) for comparative CT experiments. Transcript abundance was determined using the
comparative CT method for relative quantification [51], by
employing the individuals of a particular HbI phenotype
with the lowest gene expression as calibrators. Amplification efficiency (E = (10)(-1/slope)) was assessed using serial
dilutions (1:4); the initial concentration of the template
was 20 ng of cDNA. The results were analysed with MiniTab software (version 14, Minitab Inc.). Data were tested
for normality using the Anderson-Darling normality test
and analysed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey's test.
Sample preparation for protein electrophoresis
For the protein analysis of hemoglobin phenotypes, 100
l of red blood cells (RBCs) were washed twice with two
volumes of ice-cold saline solution (1 mM Tris, pH 8.0,
200 mM NaCl) and collected by centrifugation at 3,000 ×
g for 5 min. at 4°C. The RBCs were lysed in 300 l of cold
buffer (1 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl
fluoride). To complete hemolysis, samples were placed on

Page 11 of 14

BMC Genetics 2009, 10:51

ice for 10 minutes and then at -80°C for 15 min. Cellular
debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15
minutes at 4°C and the hemolysate was stored in 100 mM
NaCl at -80°C. Protein concentration of the hemolysate
was measured using the Bradford method [52].
Agar gel electrophoresis
For agar gel electrophoresis 20 l of the hemolysate was
mixed with 10 l of 40% sucrose and 15 l of the samples
were run on a 2% agar gel at 10 V cm-1 for 2.5 to 3 hrs
using reverse polarity. Smithies buffer (45 mM Tris, 25
mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA) pH 8.6, was used as an electrode buffer, and diluted 1:1 with distilled water for the
gel buffer. Gels were stained in a Coomassie Blue R-250
solution for 2 hours, and then de-stained overnight in a
mixture of 40% methanol:10% acetic acid.
Isoelectrofocusing (IEF)
All individuals were analysed for the Hb electrophoretic
type by IEF to determine if this method could resolve
additional polymorphisms relative to those uncovered by
agar gel electrophoresis. Protein separation was performed using precast pH 3-10 and pH 5-8 IEF ready gels
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Mississauga, ON, Canada). The
cathodic buffer was 20 mM lysine and 20 mM arginine
and the anodic buffer was 7 mM phosphoric acid. Gels
were run for 2.5 hours using a stepwise protocol: 100 V for
1 hour followed by 250 V for 1 hour and 500 V for 30
minutes. Gels were fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid and
then rinsed in a solution of 40% methanol: 10% acetic
acid to remove the ampholytes. Staining was performed as
described above for the proteins separated by agar gel electrophoresis. IEF revealed more Hb components than agar
electrophoresis but no additional polymorphisms were
found within individuals of the three Hb electrophoretic
types.
Phylogenetic analysis
Multiple alignments were done using Clustal X [53] and
edited with BioEdit 7.0 [54]. Phylogenetic analyses
employed Neighbor-Joining (JTT model, pairwise deletion, bootstrap value 500), Maximum-Likelihood (JTT
model, gamma estimated, number of replicates 100), and
Bayesian inference (WAG model; 500,000 generations;
sample frequency 100; burnin 1000) and were performed
using MEGA 4.0 [55], PHYML [56], and Mr. Bayes 3.1
[57], respectively. The phylogenetic trees were displayed
using TreeView [58].
