Abstract
Background: Globin isoforms with variant properties and functions have been found in the pseudocoel,
body wall and cuticle of various nematode species and even in the eyespots of the insect-parasite Mermis
nigrescens. In fact, much higher levels of complexity exist, as shown by recent whole genome analysis
studies. In silico analysis of the genome of Caenorhabditis elegans revealed an unexpectedly high number of
globin genes featuring a remarkable diversity in gene structure, amino acid sequence and expression
profiles.
Results: In the present study we have analyzed whole genomic data from C. briggsae, C. remanei,
Pristionchus pacificus and Brugia malayi and EST data from several other nematode species to study the
evolutionary history of the nematode globin gene family. We find a high level of conservation of the C.
elegans globin complement, with even distantly related nematodes harboring orthologs to many
Caenorhabditis globins. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis resolves all nematode globins into two distinct globin
classes. Analysis of the globin intron-exon structures suggests extensive loss of ancestral introns and gain
of new positions in deep nematode ancestors, and mainly loss in the Caenorhabditis lineage. We also show
that the Caenorhabditis globin genes are expressed in distinct, mostly non-overlapping, sets of cells and that
they are all under strong purifying selection.
Conclusion: Our results enable reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the globin gene family in
the nematode phylum. A duplication of an ancestral globin gene occurred before the divergence of the
Platyhelminthes and the Nematoda and one of the duplicated genes radiated further in the nematode
phylum before the split of the Spirurina and Rhabditina and was followed by further radiation in the lineage
leading to Caenorhabditis. The resulting globin genes were subject to processes of subfunctionalization and
diversification leading to cell-specific expression patterns. Strong purifying selection subsequently
dampened further evolution and facilitated fixation of the duplicated genes in the genome.

Background
Globins are small globular proteins, usually consisting of
about 140–150 amino acids that comprise eight α-helical
segments (named A-H), displaying a characteristic 3-over3 α-helical sandwich structure that encloses an iron-containing heme group. Vertebrate globin genes predominantly contain three exons separated by two introns
inserted at highly conserved positions B12.2 (intron
located between codon positions 2 and 3 of the 12th
amino acid of globin helix B) and G7.0 (intron inserted
between the codons for amino acids 6 and 7 of helix G).
Organisms can express multiple globin molecules that
have variant properties and functions. Vertebrates typically express haemoglobin in red blood cells, myoglobin
in muscle, neuroglobin in nervous tissue [1] and
cytoglobin in a variety of non-neuronal cells [2]. Invertebrate globins constitute a more heterogeneous group in
terms of structure and function. They range from singledomain globins to large, multisubunit, multidomain
hemoglobins and can be fused with nonglobin subunits
forming chimeric proteins. Besides a conventional O2
storage and transport function, a wealth of diverse functions has been described for invertebrate globins [3,4].
Nematodes express distinct globin isoforms in the pseudocoel, body wall and cuticle [5]. The emergence of whole
genome analysis tools has revealed even higher levels of
complexity. In silico analysis of the C. elegans genome
identified 33 putative globin genes in this species using a
robust alignment procedure based on conserved structural
features of the classical globin fold. These globins feature
a wide diversity in gene structure, amino acid sequence
and expression profiles. Despite this remarkable variety
some of them display significant sequence similarity to
vertebrate myoglobin, neuroglobin and cytoglobin [6,7].
The availability of full genomic sequences of two additional Caenorhabditis species presents a unique opportunity to explore the evolutionary globin dynamics of these
species. In this study we provide a comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the Caenorhabditis globin gene family
and we document that globins are found in a broad range
of other nematode species.

Results and discussion
Occurrence of globins in the Nematoda
We identified globin gene sequences and exon-structures
from full genomic sequences of five nematodes: the
Caenorhabditis species C. elegans, C. briggsae and C. remanei
(Rhabditina, Rhabditidae) and the distantly related nematodes Pristionchus pacificus (Rhabditina, Diplogasteromorpha) and Brugia malayi (Spirurina, Spiruromorpha)
(Additional file 1). This allows comparison of nematode
globins across three levels – ortholog evolution within the
Caenorhabditis genus, ortholog evolution across more dis-

tantly related nematodes and evolution of paralogous
genes.
Ortholog conservation for C. elegans globins varied across
levels. We identified clear orthologs of all 33 C. elegans
genes in C. briggsae and C. remanei, but reciprocal blast
searches with the TBLASTN algorithm [8] and the C. elegans globin amino acid sequences identified only 24 and
13 globins in the genomes of Pristionchus pacificus and
Brugia malayi, respectively, reducing the number of
orthologs shared by all 5 species to 10.
By screening NEMBASE [9] we found 103 parasitic globins in several other parasitic nematodes with E-values
below e-05. Some matched sequences of already known
nematode globins from GenBank, while others lacked
parts of the A-or H-helix reducing the total number of different NEMBASE EST clusters to 85 (Table 1). Thus far, we
can conclude that globins are present in 31 different nematode species representing 4 nematode clades (I, III, IV
and V [10,11]). In addition to the species listed in Table 1,
partial globin sequences were also detected in Heterodera
schachtii, Litomosoides sigmodontis, Meloidogyne chitwoodi
and Strongyloides ratti.
Two separate globin classes?
Overall, we recovered over 120 new globin-like sequences
from exhaustive database searches. Globin domains were
extracted, aligned (Additional files 2 and 3) and subjected
to phylogenetic analysis. Bayesian inference of the globin
domains of all 33 C. elegans globins and globins from a
representative set of 26 non-Rhabditid, mostly parasitic,
species and globins from plants, trematodes and a sea
anemone (Nematostella vectensis) as outgroup taxa clearly
separated two classes of nematode globins. Class I globins
comprises C. elegans ZK637.13, well known globins from
other nematode species and novel related nematode
globin isoforms as well as the trematode globins and is
supported by 100% posterior probability. Class II globin
genes consist of the remaining 32 Caenorhabditis globins
and novel orthologs thereof, identified in parasitic nematodes (Figure 1). They form a more diverse clade that is
resolved from the sea anemone globins with moderate
support (p = 0.78). This pattern was essentially retained,
though not satisfactorily supported, when more globins
from distantly related eukaryotes were included in the
analysis (results not shown). We included the cnidarian
and trematode globins in this analysis because a recent
phylogenomic analysis resolved the Cnidaria as a sister
taxon to the Bilateria and the Lophotrochozoa (comprising the Platyhelminthes) as a sister taxon to the Ecdysoza,
to which the Nematoda belong [12]. Thus Bayesian inference seems to indicate that a class II ancestral globin
evolved before the divergence of the Platyhelminthes and
the Nematoda and radiated further in the nematode phy-

lum. Alternative phylogenetic methods, neighbor-joining
(MEGA [13]) and maximum likelihood (RAxML [14]),
were consistent with Bayesian analysis but statistical support was not significant (data not shown).
The finding that 9 parasite EST's resolve with class II globins feeds our expectation that many more are to be
detected as more nematode genome sequences will
become available. The phylogenetic trees represented in
Figure 2 and Figure 3 clearly illustrate that the divergence
of the globin genes preceded species divergence. Also,
molecular and species trees (Brugia separates first, followed by Pristionchus and next the Caenorhabdits cluster) agree very well for most globin genes. Of note are the
very short branch lengths from the Caenorhabditis ancestor to the three extant species, considering that these species diverged around 100 million year ago [15] (Figure 3).
These branch lengths are disproportionally short, relative
to the branch lengths generated for Brugia and Pristionchus and even more so to those representing the divergence of the globin genes. A likely explanation is that the
rate of evolution of the globin genes drastically slowed
down in Caenorhabditis. Alternatively, diversity within
Caenorhabditis could represent less of nematode history
(i.e. a much more recent divergence) than previously
appreciated. To distinguish between these possibilities we
explored the rate of evolution of several other gene families including astacins, superoxide dismutases, glutathione S-transferases, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,
hedgehog-related proteins and ATP-binding proteins. We
assembled a matrix of as many as possible five-way
orthologs for the five taxa and analyzed the resulting
matrix by Bayesian inference using partitioning of the
data (Additional file 4). The ratios of the branch lengths
from Brugia malayi or Pristionchus pacificus to the
Caenorhabditis internal node and the average branch
length of that node to the extant species suggest that the
evolutionary rate is quite variable among gene families
(Table 2). However, these results also suggest that four
(globins, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, astacins and
hedgehog-related proteins) out of the seven multigene
families tested evolved more slowly in the Caenorhabditis
lineage.
Tissue-specific expression
We constructed gene fusions of approx 800 – 3000 bp
upstream promoter and enhancer regions for all 33 globin
genes to the coding region of GFP. Spatial expression patterns were observed for 32 genes. Although we have not
yet unambiguously identified the specific cells expressing
these genes it is clear that these globins are expressed in
distinct, mostly non-overlapping sets of cells. Most globin
genes were expressed in neuronal cells in the head and tail
portions of the body, and the nerve cord. A minority of
the globin genes were expressed in non-neuronal tissues,

including body wall and vulval muscle and the pharynx;
only one globin gene, C26C6.7 was expressed in muscular
tissue exclusively. We never observed GFP expression in
the intestine or gonad (Table 3 and Figure 4).
Intron evolution
Analysis of the gene structures for conserved globin
domains for the 10 five-way conserved orthologs revealed
striking differences across evolutionary levels (Table 4).
Consistent with previous findings (e.g. [16]), most intron
positions (23/24) were conserved across Caenorhabditis
species. Orthologous gene structures were more diverged
between genera, but majorities of positions were shared
across genera for each species (17/24 Caenorhabditis positions were also identified in Pristionchus and/or Brugia,
25/48 Pristionchus pacificus insertion positions in
Caenorhabditis and/or Brugia, and 23/30 B. malayi positions in Caenorhabditis and/or Pristionchus). To determine
the relative contribution of intron loss and gain to these
patterns, we used previously published methods [17,18]
to reconstruct evolution (Figure 5). Estimated numbers of
gains and losses were similar (22 versus 34), in stark contrast to patterns observed within Caenorhabditis [19-22].
These reconstructions suggest very different histories in
Caenorhabditis (four losses for each gain) and P. pacificus
(60% more gains than losses).

The most striking pattern is seen at the level of divergence
between paralogs. In contrast to the generally conserved
intron positions of most eukaryotic globins, nematode
globins exhibit a tremendous variability in intron positions (Additional file 1). Interestingly, only one
Caenorhabditis globin (F21A3.6) displays the typical
ancestral intron positions common to vertebrates and
other eukaryotes (at positions B12.2 and G7.0), as do the
B. malayi and P. pacificus orthologs. In addition, the Brugia
ortholog of C. elegans globin gene ZK637.13, which has
only one intron inserted at E3.2, has B12.2 and G7.0,
whereas the Pristionchus ortholog contains B12.2 and
G7.0 as well as E3.2. Finally, we found no strong evidence
for or against any particular model of intron gain – consistent with the apparent age of the introns (most dating
to early nematodes), no clear sequence similarity was
observed to other genomic sequences (as expected by
transposition of existing introns or intron creation by
transposable element insertion) or to flanking exonic
sequences (as expected by transformation of duplicated
genomic sequence into a new intron). The diversity of
globin intron positions in nematodes stands in stark contrast to that observed in some other lineages. For instance,
in vertebrates, despite a degree of sequence divergence
among paralogous globins comparable to that in nematodes, intron positions are generally conserved. Notably,
intron-exon structure of nematode globins follows protein divergence; F21A3.6 is both the only gene to retain
both ancestral introns, and shows the highest sequence
identity to vertebrate globins (specifically, vertebrate
myoglobin; data not shown).
In total, then, nematode globin intron-exon structures
suggest a large amount of intron change (loss of ancestral
introns and gain of new positions) in deep nematode
ancestors, followed by differential loss and gain in individual subsequent lineages, with the Caenorhabditis lineage showing a pronounced excess of loss over gain. These
data deepen the mystery of atypical nematode intron evolution (including high rates of loss and gain, frequent
trans-splicing, and atypical intron splicing signals).
Mode of selective pressure
The striking diversity of nematode globins raises the question of the role of natural selection on the evolution of
these genes. We determined the ratio of non-synonymous
(Ka) to synonymous substitution (Ks) rates for each
orthologous briggsae/elegans pair (Table 5). The substitution ratio (ω) is expected to be near 1 for genes under neutral selection, greater than 1 for genes under positive
selection and smaller than 1 for those under negative
selection. All ω-ratios ranged from 0.0070 to 0.1876 with
an average of 0.0367, indicating functional constraint.
Similar results were found for the orthologous elegans/
remanei (average of 0.0359) and briggsae/remanei (0.0463

on average) pairs. No substantial differences were
obtained when this analysis was applied on the globin
domains only (results not shown). All C. elegans globin
genes are expressed [7]. Although pseudogenes have been
found in C. elegans with ω-ratios down to 0.4 (Ian Hope,
personal communication), the combination of these find-

ings refutes the possibility that some of them would be
pseudogenes.
We also asked whether the large N- and C-terminal extensions of many C. elegans globins are required for their specific function. To this end we searched for positive
selection on individual amino acids, because positive
selection is thought to act only on specific residues in a
protein that is under purifying selection [23]. No positive
selection was detected using the maximum likelihood
procedure of Thomas et al. [24,25], even in globin
Y75B7AL.1, which is a chimeric polypeptide composed of
a C-terminal globin domain and an N-terminal domain
that has all characteristics of a G-coupled sensor. This
domain contains 7 transmembrane helices and this structure is a candidate target for positive selection [25]. The
strong purifying selection acting on the globin genes is
consistent with the slowing of the rate of evolution of the
exon-structures in the genus Caenorhabditis.

Conclusion
Our study unveils an unexpected complexity of the globin
family in nematodes. Caenorhabditis species contain a very
large number of globin genes, and even distantly related
nematode species harbor orthologs to many of them. Our
analysis provides some evidence for a number of gene
duplication events giving rise to a class of globin genes
that is likely unique to the nematode phylum. It remains
to be seen whether this class will persist as more genomes
will become available.

It is generally accepted that gene duplication played a
major role in the evolution of eukaryotic genomes, particularly in the origin of multi-gene families [26]. Duplication events that gave rise to the radiation of nematode
globin genes most likely occurred too long ago to leave
behind obvious evidence of adaptive evolution. The dispersion of the globin genes over all six chromosomes of C.
elegans is consistent with this idea. Globins R102.9 and
F49E2.4 are exceptional in showing strong sequence conservation (Figure 2) and sharing 2 intron positions (Additional file 1). However, they are located on different
chromosomes, arguing against a very recent tandem
duplication event. Similarly, both C. briggsae orthologs
are found on different chromosomes.

Why would tiny animals like Caenorhabditis species need
up to 33 different globins? We have shown that they are
all expressed and subject to strong purifying selection.
Extensive gene duplication appears to be typical for
Caenorhabditis. Other surprisingly large gene families
include astacins [27], insulins [28], chemoreceptors
[20,21] and orphan nuclear receptors HNF4 [29]. Subfunctionalization is frequently invoked to explain the
retention of duplicate genes, and differences in gene
expression patterns of duplicate genes are generally
advanced in support of this hypothesis [30-33]. It is likely
that this mechanism was the driving force for the expansion of the Caenorhabditis globin family. We have demonstrated that these genes are expressed in distinct subsets of
cells and that they are subject to strong purifying selection, in line with this hypothesis. Further support is provided by differential expression of subsets of globin genes
in the dauer stage and upon oxygen deprivation [7]. Evidence is mounting that behavioral responses of C. elegans
to attracting or repelling chemicals including oxygen and
CO2 are generated by gene activities that are deployed in
different combinations of neurons [34-37]. Individual

worm neurons seem to have attained very high specialization which is in keeping with their expressing unique or
small subsets of globin isoforms.
To date the precise function of none of these globins is
known. It seems unlikely that they would all be required
for simple oxygen transportation or storage purposes.
Globins that are upregulated when oxygen supply is low
might serve this function [7]. Other functions are also
plausible. It has been shown that C. elegans senses molecular oxygen through the heme domain of a guanylate
cyclase homolog (GCY-35) and reacts rapidly to changing
oxygen levels with aerotaxis responses [37,38]. We expect
that some globins may play similar roles in distinct sensory neurons. One likely candidate is globin Y75B7AL.1
which has all characteristics of a G-coupled sensor. Still
other functions are worth consideration. Globin T22C1.2
oxidizes instantly to the ferric form in the presence of oxygen and is therefore not capable of reversible oxygen binding (unpublished results). We speculate that this globin
may participate in redox reactions with an as yet unidentified reaction partner. Alternatively, peroxidase activity

which is a latent but inherent property of globins might
have evolved to become the ultimate function of other C.
elegans globins. Finally, we cannot exclude a potential role
as an alternative oxidase during anaerobiosis, when levels
of oxygen drop below saturation of cytochrome oxidase,
as has been well documented for plant cells [39,40].

(AAL56427), Pseudoterranova decipiens (P26914). All
encoded globin sequences were aligned manually as
described previously [42,43].

Methods

Globin gene expression analysis
The putative promoter and enhancer sequences upstream
of the predicted start codon of each globin gene were
extracted from the UCSC Genome Browser database using
a repeat masker function [44]. PCR primers were designed
to amplify about 3 kb of N2 wild-type genomic DNA, this
size was reduced as needed to exclude any upstream gene
located at a shorter distance. Promotor-GFP fusion constructs were generated as described by [45]. pRF4 rol6(su1006) plasmid and promoter-reporter fusion construct were co-injected at 100 ng/μl and 50 ng/μl, respectively, into the gonads of young adult hermaphrodites.
Rolling F1 worms were transferred to fresh plates and rolling F2 progeny were examined for fluorescence using an
Axiovert 200 M (Zeiss) fluorescence microscope. At least 2
independent transgenic lines were examined for each
globin gene. These lines generally displayed very similar
GFP expression patterns. Primer sequences are available
upon request.

Sequence database searches
The BLAST algorithm [8] was employed to search the
sequence databases WormBase (Release WS182), TIGR
(Brugia malayi) and http://www.pristionchus.org (Assembly Freeze 1). NEMBASE 3, containing EST clusters from
37 different partial parasitic nematode genomes [9], was
searched for globin motifs (PF00041, PS01033 and
SSF46458). Additional EST sequences were searched from
EMBL-EBI parasite EST, and the NCBI parasite EST databases using the BLAST algorithm [8] with the Caenorhabditis globins as query sequences and cut off E-values of e05. In cases where the identification of a putative globin
was uncertain, searches employing FUGUE [41] were used
to determine whether the borderline sequence should be
accepted as a globin.

Additional sequences of known nematode globins were
obtained from GenBank: Trichostrongylus colubriformis
(AAA30102), Nippostrongylus brasiliensis cuticular globin
(P51536), Nippostrongylus brasiliensis body wall globin
(P51535),Toxocara canis body wall globin (AAL56428),
Toxocara canis perienteric globin (AAL56430), Ascaris
suum myoglobin (AAA64695), Ascaris suum hemoglobin

used the Yang and Nielsen [46] maximum likelihood
method implemented in the YN00 program of the PAML
package version 3.15 [47] since the Nei and Gojobori [48]
method was not applicable in some cases. Similar results
were generated in cases where both methods were applicable.
Phylogenetic analysis
Bayesian inference trees were obtained employing
MrBayes version 3.1.2 [49]; four chains were run simultaneously for 4 × 106 generations and trees were sampled
every 100 generations generating a total of 40000 trees.
The final average standard deviations of split frequencies
were stationary and in the range of about 0.016. Posterior
probabilities were estimated on the final 30000 trees. The
appropriate model of amino acid sequence evolution (JTT
model [50]) was selected by ProtTest [51] using the
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
