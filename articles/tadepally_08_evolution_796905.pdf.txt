Abstract
Background: C2H2 zinc finger genes (C2H2-ZNF) constitute the largest class of transcription
factors in humans and one of the largest gene families in mammals. Often arranged in clusters in
the genome, these genes are thought to have undergone a massive expansion in vertebrates,
primarily by tandem duplication. However, this view is based on limited datasets restricted to a
single chromosome or a specific subset of genes belonging to the large KRAB domain-containing
C2H2-ZNF subfamily.
Results: Here, we present the first comprehensive study of the evolution of the C2H2-ZNF family
in mammals. We assembled the complete repertoire of human C2H2-ZNF genes (718 in total),
about 70% of which are organized into 81 clusters across all chromosomes. Based on an analysis
of their N-terminal effector domains, we identified two new C2H2-ZNF subfamilies encoding genes
with a SET or a HOMEO domain. We searched for the syntenic counterparts of the human clusters
in other mammals for which complete gene data are available: chimpanzee, mouse, rat and dog.
Cross-species comparisons show a large variation in the numbers of C2H2-ZNF genes within
homologous mammalian clusters, suggesting differential patterns of evolution. Phylogenetic analysis
of selected clusters reveals that the disparity in C2H2-ZNF gene repertoires across mammals not
only originates from differential gene duplication but also from gene loss. Further, we discovered
variations among orthologs in the number of zinc finger motifs and association of the effector
domains, the latter often undergoing sequence degeneration. Combined with phylogenetic studies,
physical maps and an analysis of the exon-intron organization of genes from the SCAN and KRAB
domains-containing subfamilies, this result suggests that the SCAN subfamily emerged first,
followed by the SCAN-KRAB and finally by the KRAB subfamily.
Conclusion: Our results are in agreement with the "birth and death hypothesis" for the evolution
of C2H2-ZNF genes, but also show that this hypothesis alone cannot explain the considerable
evolutionary variation within the subfamilies of these genes in mammals. We, therefore, propose a
new model involving the interdependent evolution of C2H2-ZNF gene subfamilies.

Background
The sequencing of the human genome uncovered that a
large number of gene families are often arranged in a clustered organization [1-3]. C2H2 zinc finger (C2H2-ZNF)
genes make up ~2% of all the human genes and represent
the second largest gene family in humans after the odorant receptor family [4-7]. The first identified members of
the C2H2-ZNF family were Xenopus TFIIIA and Drosophila
Kruppel and thus genes of this family are often called zinc
finger genes of the TFIIIA or Kruppel type [6,8].
Most of the characterized C2H2-ZNF genes code for transcription factors which bind DNA through their zinc finger region; others bind RNA and their exact function is as
yet unknown [9,10]. The zinc finger region is composed
of a basic structural unit of 28 amino acids
(CX2–4CX3FX5LX2HX3–4HTGEKPYX, where X is any amino
acid), called the zinc finger motif that is often repeated in
tandem. The two cysteines and two histidines in this motif
interact with a zinc ion, stabilizing the proper folding of
this motif [11-13]. C2H2-ZNF proteins often contain an
effector domain that is always located N-terminal to the
zinc finger region, such as the KRAB (Kruppel-AssociatedBox), SCAN (SRE-ZBP, CTfin51, AW-1 and Number18
cDNA) and BTB (Broad-Complex, Tramtrack and Bric-abric) domains. The first two domains are vertebrate-specific [14-16], while BTB is also present in insects. The
KRAB domain includes the KRAB A box (~38 amino
acids) involved in transcriptional repression, and often a
second box, usually KRAB B (~32 amino acids) or in a few
cases KRAB b or KRAB C (~21 amino acids) box [17-20].
The KRAB A box and the second KRAB B, b or C boxes are
encoded by separate exons often prone to alternative
splicing. The SCAN, also called the leucine-rich (LeR)
domain (~84 amino acids) [21], mediates protein-protein
interactions through dimerization [22,23]. The BTB
domain (~120 amino acids) is a dimerization domain
that also acts as a repression domain in some cases [24].
In contrast to the SCAN and KRAB domains, which are
only present in C2H2-ZNF proteins, the BTB domain is
also found as a part of actin-binding proteins [16]. C2H2ZNF proteins are grouped into different subfamilies based
on the type of N-terminal effector domain present.
Initial studies on the C2H2-ZNF gene family focused on
human chromosome 19, which is particularly enriched in
clusters of these genes [25,26]. More recent studies dealt
more specifically with the KRAB subfamily [18,27-29].
The current view is that C2H2-ZNF genes have undergone
a massive expansion during vertebrate evolution, primarily by tandem duplication [18,27,29-32]. Yet, this view
may be biased, because it is extrapolated from subsets of
C2H2-ZNF genes.

In this report, we reconstruct a global picture of the evolution of the C2H2-ZNF gene repertoires during mammalian speciation that is based on a comprehensive
catalogue of all human C2H2-ZNF genes and their syntenic counterparts present in clusters in other mammals.
Our study clearly demonstrates that this gene family
expanded and contracted not only in human but across
mammals, and in a lineage-specific fashion. In addition,
we discovered evolutionary change of individual C2H2ZNF orthologs involving both differential duplication of
zinc finger motifs and loss of N-terminal effector
domains. This led us to propose a model for the interlinked evolution of SCAN, SCAN-KRAB and KRAB subfamilies, underlining the importance of comparing
complete gene repertoires rather than specific subfamilies
for gaining insights into the possible orthologous relationships between genes from various genomes. Our data
indicates that during speciation of mammals, divergent
evolutionary trends at the level of individual C2H2-ZNF
genes as well as the entire family characterized the evolution of the C2H2-ZNF genes.

Results
Compilation of a comprehensive catalogue of human
C2H2-ZNF genes
Previous studies reported the existence of at least 564
C2H2-ZNF genes in the human genome and suggested
that this family may include approximately 700–800
genes [7,14]. As a first step to study the evolution of
C2H2-ZNF genes, we established a comprehensive catalogue of the C2H2-ZNF genes in the human genome. By
conducting an extensive similarity search (see Methods
and Figure 1 for a flowchart of the study) we identified
718 C2H2-ZNF genes (see Additional File 1). Of the 718
genes, 66 are annotated as pseudogenes in GenBank. For
all genes, we determined their exact position on the chromosomes, their orientation, the number of finger motifs
and the effector domains.

C2H2-ZNF genes are distributed across all chromosomes
of the human genome (see Additional File 2). As reported
earlier, chromosome 19 has the highest number [2] and
density of these genes, i.e., 40% (289 of the 718), whereas
this chromosome corresponds to only 2.1% of the human
genome. More than half (58%) of the C2H2-ZNF genes
encode conserved N-terminal domains, the KRAB, SCAN
and BTB domains (see Figure 2A), typically involved in
transcriptional regulation [16,33] and form different
C2H2-ZNF subfamilies. Further, we discovered two additional domains typical of transcription regulators, the SET
and HOMEO domains that are also encoded by C2H2ZNF genes. While the KRAB subfamily represents almost
half of the C2H2-ZNF genes (45%), SET and HOMEO
C2H2-ZNF genes together with members of all the other

subfamilies account for only a small percentage (~12%)
of the C2H2-ZNF genes (see Figure 2A).
Clustered organization of human C2H2-ZNF genes
It was reported earlier that human chromosome 19 is particularly rich in tandemly duplicated C2H2-ZNF genes
and that KRAB C2H2-ZNF genes are also found in clusters
on several other chromosomes [32,34]. In order to trace
the duplication history of the entire C2H2-ZNF repertoire,
we studied the distribution of these genes across the
whole human genome. Two consecutive C2H2-ZNF genes
were considered to belong to a cluster if the distance
between them is ≤ 500 Kbp, regardless of the presence of
other genes or pseudogenes within the cluster (see Methods). Using this definition, we identified 81 human
C2H2-ZNF clusters accounting for 72% of the total
number of C2H2-ZNF genes (518 of the 718) (see Additional Files 2 and 3). The remaining genes are dispersed as
singletons. Among these clusters, 31% include exclusively
tandemly organized C2H2-ZNF genes with no other intervening genes (see Figure 2B and Additional File 3). The
number of C2H2-ZNF genes per cluster ranges from 2 to
76 with an average of 6. As illustrated in the Figure 2B,
about 75% of the total numbers of C2H2-ZNF clusters

have between two to six genes. Consistent with previous
reports, chromosome 19 not only has the largest number
of C2H2-ZNF clusters (see Additional File 2) but also
hosts the largest clusters (>12 genes) (see Figure 2B and
Additional File 3).
We find that the large majority of KRAB (89%) and SCAN
(90%) types of C2H2-ZNF genes are arranged in clusters
(see Figure 2A and Additional File 2). This contrasts with
the BTB subfamily of C2H2-ZNF genes or those lacking
effector domains, which occur more often as singletons in
the genome. An analysis of the composition of individual
clusters revealed that two-third of the clusters contains a
mixture of various C2H2-ZNF subfamilies (see 'mixed
clusters', Additional File 3). The few clusters made up of a
single C2H2-ZNF gene subfamily ('pure clusters') are of
small size (< 4 genes).
Identification and comparison of syntenic C2H2-ZNF
clusters across mammals

mammals are listed in Additional File 4, which also
includes information on the orientation of the genes in
the clusters, their associated domains, the number of zinc
finger motifs and the flanking genes.
Primates (Homo sapiens and Pan troglodytes) stand out for
their large number of both C2H2-ZNF clusters and genes
within them, as compared to rodents (Mus musculus and
Rattus norvegicus) and dog (Canis familiaris) (see Figure
3A). The most parsimonious explanation is that a large
expansion of C2H2-ZNF genes occurred in primates, and
more particularly in human (518 genes in human versus
397 in chimpanzee) after divergence from rodents and
canines. Rat has slightly fewer C2H2-ZNF genes than dog
(7%), but 25% less than mouse. Considering the evolutionary relationship of the species (see Figure 3A), these
data suggest not only species-specific duplication events,
as reported earlier [29,31,32], but also loss of family
members (suggested here in rodents) during the evolution
of mammals. Differential species-specific expansion was
reported previously for a subset of genes from the human
ZNF45 subfamily on chromosome 19 compared with its
mouse counterpart [29]. Furthermore, expansion of the
human KRAB C2H2-ZNF subfamily was also shown earlier based on draft versions of the genomes of chimpanzee, mouse and dog [27]. However, evidence of C2H2ZNF gene or cluster loss could not be obtained in these
previous studies as it required detailed analysis of more
than two completely sequenced genomes.

cluster. All the C2H2-ZNF genes found within the delimited syntenic regions were then identified using a
TBLASTN search (see Methods). The 81 human C2H2ZNF clusters and their syntenic counterparts in other

Comparing individual syntenic clusters in the mammalian
genomes
To distinguish whether differences in the number of
C2H2-ZNF clusters are due to species-specific gene gain or
loss, we systematically compared individual syntenic clusters in the five mammalian genomes studied. The results
of this analysis point to a differential evolutionary history
in mammals. About 60% of the human clusters (49) have
syntenically homologous counterparts in all the species
studied, indicating that these C2H2-ZNF clusters predate
the divergence of dog, rodents and primates (see Additional File 4 and Additional File 5). In addition, we found
(i) primate specific clusters (14, including 2 human specific clusters), (ii) clusters, present in primates and dog,
that were lost in rodents (8 clusters including 3 present in
mouse but absent in rat) and (iii) clusters present in primates and rodents but absent in dog (10 clusters) (examples in Figure 3B). Essentially all the primate clusters have
larger number of genes than rodent or dog clusters, which
reflect a global primate-specific expansion of C2H2-ZNF
genes (see Additional File 5). Further, in 40% of all primate clusters, those from human contain more C2H2ZNF genes than those from chimpanzee. This indicates
that most of the evolutionary changes (duplication and/or
loss) occurred late in the primate branch. A similar pattern

was seen in rodents, where almost all mouse C2H2-ZNF
clusters exhibit more genes than their syntenic rat clusters.
While these results illustrate that the C2H2-ZNF gene
family is rapidly and independently evolving within different lineages, insights into the role of gene duplication
and loss in the history of this gene family required rigorous phylogenetic analysis as described below.
Phylogeny of C2H2-ZNF clusters in mammalian genomes
To address the relative contribution of gene duplication
and loss in the evolution of C2H2-ZNF genes in mammals, we focused our study on selected large human
C2H2-ZNF clusters and their syntenic counterparts in four
other mammals. We expected that larger clusters would be
more informative and possibly more representative of the
whole genomes. Because of the clear evolutionary scenarios observed in the tree, we present here a detailed phylogenetic analysis of the second largest human C2H2-ZNF
cluster (43 genes) located on chromosome 19q13.4, that
we named cluster 19.12, and of its syntenic clusters (see
Additional Files 3 and 4) in other species. For phylogenetic analysis, we used the predicted amino acid
sequences of the zinc finger regions. Genes annotated as
pseudogenes in Genbank were not considered in the phylogenetic analysis. Our total data set of C2H2-ZNF
sequences from the human cluster 19.12 and their syn-

tenic homologs in chimpanzee, mouse, rat and dog consists of 101 protein sequences, including the outgroup
sequences from Xenopus and chicken. We constructed a
phylogenetic tree using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian methods. We subdivided the tree into three groups
(see Figure 5) based on the kind of evolutionary scenarios
observed i.e., one-to-one and one-to-many orthologous
relationships between genes as well as gene loss as defined
in Figure 4. The number of C2H2-ZNF sequences from
each species is highlighted for each group. Two of these
groups are monophyletic with significant (≥ 95%) support in both the Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian analysis (Group I and III).
A detailed analysis of the tree revealed four clades that
underwent species-specific expansion, and two clades,
with gene loss in some species. For example, a dog-specific
expansion is seen in the monophyletic Group I, which
includes three clustering genes from human (hZNF331),
chimpanzee (pZNF331) and dog (cZNF331), which in
turn grouped within a larger clade containing nine additional C2H2-ZNF genes from dog. In addition, this clade
indicates a loss in rodents, due to the absence of any
mouse or rat genes. Group I alone illustrates how both
species-specific duplication in dog and loss in rodents can

three genes suggests a loss in these species. For chimpanzee, however, loss by pseudogenization is possibly
involved (see physical maps described below); note that
the percentage of C2H2-ZNF genes annotated as pseudogenes was higher in chimpanzee than in human C2H2ZNF clusters (see Additional File 4: '62 chimpanzee vs. 25
human pseudogenes').
In Group III, the relationship of the four rodent genes
with the dog and primate genes could not be resolved
(bootstrap < 95%). Still, a rodent-specific clade revealed a
duplication exclusively in mouse (to the exclusion of rat),
and also exhibited a higher number of genes in mouse, as
seen in several other cases in our study.

account for the higher number of genes seen in dog
C2H2-ZNF clusters as compared to rodents.
Group II shows more pronounced expansion in human as
seen in several clusters. For example, one of the primatespecific clades includes 17 human genes and 7 chimpanzee C2H2-ZNF genes (see Figure 5). Of the 17 human
genes present in the clade, only 6 genes show a one-to-one
orthologous pairing with chimpanzee genes. Another well
supported clade (100% bootstrap) includes a single
human gene (hZNF677) clustered with two dog genes
(LOC484331 AND LOC476394). In this clade, the
absence of a chimpanzee or rodent counterparts to these

Superimposition of the phylogenetic trees on the physical
maps of clusters
Comparison of the species tree, gene trees and physical
map information of cluster 19.12 and its syntenic counterparts provide better insights into the processes underlying the evolution of the C2H2-ZNF clusters in the
mammalian species studied. The phylogenetic tree
obtained for cluster 19.12 (see Figure 5) suggests a simultaneous differential expansion and loss of C2H2-ZNF
genes throughout evolution. In perfect agreement with
the phylogenetic tree, genes of the monophyletic groups I
and III were found to be physically clustered together on
the chromosomes across mammals (see Figure 6). Evidence for a tandem duplication event is provided by the
comparison of the relationship within C2H2-ZNF genes
of Group I on the tree with their spatial relationships in
the physical maps, showing that the sequences of the dog
clade form a tandem array on the chromosome (see Figure
5). In addition to tandem duplication of individual genes
within this group, e.g., cLOC484324 and cLOC484323
(see Figure 5) which are next to each other on the chromosome and exhibit the same orientation (see Figure 6), we
also discovered tandem duplication of multiple genes. For
instance, three genes (LOC482273, LOC611599,
LOC480782; orientation -, +, +) appear as a tandem
repeat of three other genes (LOC611583, LOC484328,
LOC484326; orientation -, +, +) in this group (see Figures
5 and 6).

Group II mainly contains primate-specific C2H2-ZNF
genes that cluster on the phylogenetic tree in two well supported clades (≥ 97% bootstrap), plus a sub-group with
weaker support (93% bootstrap). Almost all these genes
also cluster physically together on the chromosome.
Human orthology assignments for ten of the twelve chimpanzee genes from Group II (underlined in Figure 6) were
corroborated by two lines of evidence i.e. from the phylogeny, and from the topology on the chromosome.
Noticeably, only 7 out of 10 of the C2H2-ZNF ortholog
pairs from this primate-specific cluster exhibit the same

Phylogenetic analysis of C2H2-ZNF genes in human cluster 19.12 and its syntenic counterparts in other mammals. A phylogenetic tree
was built using the amino acid sequences corresponding to the zinc finger regions of the various human C2H2-ZNF genes from cluster 19.12 and their syntenic counterparts in chimpanzee, mouse, rat and dog. The tree was generated using a maximum likelihood method (RaxML) and verified using a bayesian
method (MrBayes). 346 sites from 101 sequences (including the 20 outgroup sequences from chicken and Xenopus) were used in the analysis. The tree is
divided into three major Groups (I-III). A tabulation of the number of genes present in each group is indicated for each species (h: human, p: chimpanzee,
m: mouse, r: rat, c: dog). The bootstraps values are indicated for each node on the tree. A small black circle is also represented at each node in cases
where the posterior probability value is equal to 1.00. This cluster contains only C2H2-ZNF genes that are either from the KRAB subfamily or that do not
encode any conserved N-terminal domain. Next to the name of each C2H2-ZNF gene, the presence of an N-terminal KRAB domain is indicated by a K
and number of zinc finger motifs is mentioned. A clear evidence of differential expansion is seen in primates and dog. Loss of C2H2-ZNF in the rodent lineage is also observed.

number of zinc finger motifs and the same type of N-terminal domain, suggesting that gain or loss of zinc finger
motifs and effector domains often occurs within
orthologs.
Species-specific variation in the number of finger motifs
and the presence of N-terminal conserved domains
When analysing the C2H2-ZNF genes from the 81 human
clusters and their syntenic homologs in mammals, we
noticed that the average number of zinc finger motifs varied among the C2H2-ZNF gene subfamilies. Noticeably,
in all the mammalian species studied, genes with KRAB
and SCAN-KRAB motifs have a higher number of zinc finger motifs than those from the other subfamilies (see Figure 7A). For example, members of the KRAB subfamily
have an average of 10 to 17 zinc finger motifs, while members of the BTB subfamily have only 2 to 3 (see Figure 7A).
We also noted species-specific variation in the number of
zinc finger motifs within mammalian C2H2-ZNF genes.
In particular, dog tends to have a much higher number of
zinc finger motifs in most C2H2-ZNF gene sub-families
(see Figure 7). Strikingly, LOC484264, a KRAB C2H2-ZNF
gene from dog exhibits 70 zinc finger motifs, which is to

our knowledge the highest number reported. Study of
cluster 19.12 (see Figure 5) illustrates more specifically
the trend of dog genes to possess more zinc finger motifs;
the dog LOC484338 (Group III), for example, has six
times more zinc finger motifs than its human ortholog.
Furthermore, the dog LOC484326 has nearly twice as
many motifs as its closest paralog LOC480782 (Group I)
(see Figure 5). This indicates a quite recent and drastic
expansion of zinc finger motifs within dog C2H2-ZNF
genes, after the separation of dog from rodents and primates. In several cases, the C2H2-ZNF mammalian
orthologs revealed differences in their numbers of finger
motifs even within primate (as mentioned before) or
within rodent lineages (see finger motif numbers in Additional File 4 for genes presented in Figure 7B).
In addition to the difference in the number of finger
motifs in C2H2-ZNF orthologs and paralogs, we also
found a variation in the presence of the N-terminal effector domains. As an example, orthologs of the C2H2-ZNF
genes in the human cluster 6.2 show a variation in the
presence of the KRAB or SCAN domains (see Figure 7B),
suggesting frequent and multiple losses and/or gains of

Variation in the numbers of zinc finger motifs in mammals and in the presence of conserved N-terminal domains in orthologs
Figure 7
Variation in the numbers of zinc finger motifs in mammals and in the presence of conserved N-terminal domains in orthologs. A) The
average number of zinc finger motifs was calculated for all the C2H2-ZNF genes from the 81 human clusters identified and their corresponding syntenically
homologous clusters in the other mammals. For each species, the average number of zinc finger motifs for the total C2H2-ZNF genes (All) and for members of the various C2H2-ZNF sub-families is presented. For each category, the number of genes in each species is listed above the bars in the following
order (human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat and dog). B) For the human C2H2-ZNF cluster 6.2 (chromosome 6p22.1) and its syntenically homologous counterparts in chimpanzee, mouse, rat and dog, each C2H2-ZNF genes is represented by an open arrow which indicates its orientation on the chromosome
strands; this excludes the pseudogenes whose names appear in parenthesis. For these clusters which contain C2H2-ZNF genes that are from the KRAB or
SCAN subfamily or that do not encode any conserved N-terminal domain, the presence of a conserved N-terminal is indicated by as square for a KRAB
domain or an open circle for a SCAN domain both being positioned in front of the open arrow representing the gene. Genes identified as orthologs, based
on the phylogenetic tree and physical maps, are aligned vertically on their respective chromosomes. Cases where orthologs from the different mammals
do not consistently share the same effector domain (s) are marked by a grey box. C) Exon-Intron organization of most human C2H2-ZNF genes from the
SCAN-KRAB and SCAN subfamilies. 80% of SCAN-KRAB (11/14) and 55% of the SCAN (16/29) C2H2-ZNF genes found in clusters in human have the
presented exon-intron structures shown. The exons encoding the SCAN, KRAB (A box) and ZNF are indicated.

KRAB and SCAN domains during evolution. To reconstruct these events, we analyzed in detail the exon-intron
structure and sequences of these genes (see Methods). Serendipitously, this analysis led us to the observation that a
large majority of the C2H2-ZNF genes belonging to the
SCAN-KRAB or SCAN subfamilies had each a typical
exon-intron organization (see Figure 7C). The human
SCAN-KRAB ZNF192 and the chimpanzee SCAN ZNF187
and their respective orthologs in other species presented
in Figure 7B physical map exhibit these predominant
exon-intron structures. Among the orthologs of the
human SCAN-KRAB ZNF192, the dog LOC488318 (see
Figure 7B) seems to be an exception as it encodes only a
SCAN domain in spite of having a SCAN-KRAB exonintron structure. However, by comparing the sequences of
the third exon after the SCAN domain in dog with those
of human, mouse and rat which each encodes a KRAB
domain, we discovered significant nucleotide sequence
similarity (>82%) that was unrecognizable at the deduced
protein sequence level. This indicates that the loss of the
KRAB domain in dog was due to sequence degeneration.
Similarly, while the chimpanzee ZNF187 and its rat
ortholog encode a SCAN domain, a degenerate SCAN
domain was identified in the corresponding exon of their
human and mouse orthologs. For the human SCAN-KRAB
ZNF307, we noticed that it exhibits an exon-intron organization typical of SCAN-KRAB C2H2-ZNF genes (see Figure 7C), whereas its orthologs in the chimpanzee, mouse
and rat encode solely a SCAN domain and present an
exon-intron structure more typical of SCAN C2H2-ZNF
gene. However, it was found that in chimpanzee, a
sequence similar to the KRAB sequence (99% at the nucleotide level) was embedded in the intron preceding the
exon encoding the zinc finger domain, but no KRABrelated sequence could be detected in the rodent
orthologs. Thus, either the KRAB sequence was gained in
the primate lineage or lost in the rodent lineage. For reasons explained in the discussion (Model proposed in Figure 8), we believe that loss is the more likely hypothesis.

Discussion
Comparative studies in genome research have focused on
the extensive similarities existing between the human
genome and the genomes from various other model
organisms, which provide valuable insights into the biological function and the aetiology of human diseases.
However, differences among genomes have received less
attention, in spite of the importance they may have in the
physiological, morphological and behavioural traits that
distinguish species. A few studies on various gene families, such as the odorant receptor family, pointed to some
differences existing between genes of closely related species [35-39]. Our comprehensive study of the C2H2-ZNF
gene family reveals that there is an extensive variation of
the C2H2-ZNF gene content and organization, as well as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/176

in the domain composition of orthologous genes among
mammals. We also provide the first clear demonstration
of the contribution of gene loss in the C2H2-ZNF family
during evolution, which occurs at the level of clusters,
genes and their functional domains. We also provide the
first genome-scale confirmation of the rapid evolution of
C2H2-ZNF gene clusters that occurs independently within
related mammalian species, which also supports conclusions drawn from smaller-scale studies on individual
genes, clusters and C2H2-ZNF subfamilies [27,29,30,32].
Altogether our data led us to propose a new model for the
interdependent evolution of the main C2H2-ZNF subfamilies (see Figure 8B) as discussed below. Although it is
possible that the release of improved genome assemblies
of non-human sequences may lead to the detection of a
few new C2H2-ZNF genes or of incorrectly assembled
C2H2-ZNF loci, these are unlikely to change any conclusions drawn from this study.
Substantial variation in family size and clustering of C2H2ZNF genes across mammals
We report here the first complete catalogue of all human
C2H2-ZNF gene clusters and their syntenic homologs in
chimpanzee, mouse, rat and dog. This catalogue reveals
that in human, a large proportion of the genes from the
C2H2-ZNF family (>70%) are organized in clusters. Comparative studies of the five mammalian genomes indicated that the total number of genes found in clusters
varied considerably, from 172 in rat to 518 in human. Significantly, human and mouse have a larger number of
clustered C2H2-ZNF genes (>30%) as compared to chimpanzee and rat, respectively, indicating that independent
evolutionary events occurred after the divergence of the
two primates (within the last ~6–10 million years) and
two rodents (within ~30–46 million years). We distinguish two kinds of events: first, a variation in the number
of C2H2-ZNF genes in syntenically homologous clusters
and second, the existence of lineage- and species-specific
clusters in primates, rodents and canines. This can be
accounted for by independent evolution of C2H2-ZNF
genes in these closely related species. Previous studies
focusing on KRAB C2H2-ZNF genes from human chromosome 19 had identified and analyzed a primate-specific cluster [26] including members of the primatespecific ZNF91 subfamily of C2H2-ZNF [30]. Other studies on the KRAB C2H2-ZNF subfamily also identified a
differential expansion between a human KRAB C2H2ZNF cluster and its syntenic counterpart in mouse [29],
and more recently other species-specific expansions have
been found, from analyses based on draft sequences of
various mammalian genomes [27]. Here, we illustrate and
confirm at a larger scale the existence of an on-going process of genome dynamics including several lineage- and
species-specific rearrangements and a continuous repertoire expansion taking place independently in all evolu-

Figure 8
Model for the evolution of the SCAN, SCAN-KRAB and KRAB C2H2-ZNF subfamilies
Model for the evolution of the SCAN, SCAN-KRAB and KRAB C2H2-ZNF subfamilies. A) Sequential events leading to the birth of SCAN and
SCAN-KRAB and KRAB C2H2-ZNF subfamilies. Most of the SCAN, SCAN-KRAB and KRAB C2H2-ZNF genes have the exon-intron structure shown
(boxes represent exons). Birth of new families may have occurred presumably by an exon shuffling mechanism leading first to the acquisition of a SCAN
domain by a C2H2-ZNF gene and later of a KRAB domain by a SCAN C2H2-ZNF gene. In most SCAN-KRAB C2H2-ZNF genes, a single exon is found in
between the exon encoding the KRAB A box (identified as KRAB) and the exon encoding the zinc finger domain (ZNF). This exon encodes in most
instances the so-called KRAB B, b, or C boxes. KRAB C2H2-ZNF subfamily emergence involved the loss of the SCAN domain from SCAN-KRAB gene (s).
B) Dynamic evolution of C2H2-ZNF genes after birth of the SCAN and SCAN-KRAB subfamilies through gene duplication and recurrent loss of effector
domains. A first SCAN C2H2-ZNF gene appeared in an ancestor of vertebrates following the gain of a SCAN domain by a C2H2-ZNF gene; duplication
then led to the establishment of the SCAN C2H2-ZNF subfamily. The gain of a KRAB domain at the emergence of tetrapods by a SCAN C2H2-ZNF gene
gave rise to a SCAN-KRAB C2H2-ZNF gene. This was followed by duplication and establishment of the SCAN-KRAB subfamily. Loss of the SCAN domain
by deletion or sequence degeneration from some SCAN-KRAB C2H2-ZNF genes followed in many instances by duplication of the resulting KRAB C2H2ZNF genes led to the expansion of the KRAB C2H2-ZNF subfamily. Loss of SCAN or KRAB domains by deletion or degeneration from SCAN, SCANKRAB and KRAB C2H2-ZNF subfamilies is seen as a recurrent theme shaping the repertoires of the C2H2-ZNF subfamilies.

tionary branches, particularly in primates. This finding
was only possible through the analysis of a complete catalogue of all the subfamilies of C2H2-ZNF clusters and
their syntenic counterparts in five mammalian species.
Gene duplication and loss: two counteracting forces in the
evolution of C2H2-ZNF genes
An overview of the 81 human C2H2-ZNF clusters identified here revealed that a third of them are pure clusters
(containing 2 to 24 C2H2-ZNF genes), i.e., they are not

interspersed with other genes. Earlier observations of pure
C2H2-ZNF gene clusters have led to the hypothesis that
C2H2-ZNF genes in primates have expanded massively by
tandem duplication [25-27,40-42]. We revisited this question based on our catalogue of human C2H2-ZNF clusters
and their syntenic counterparts in chimpanzee, mouse, rat
and dog. Based on a reconciliation of both the superimposition of gene trees onto the known species trees [43] and
the physical maps, we confirm gene duplication and loss.
Our results clearly show that both gene gain and gene loss

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:176

events have occurred multiple times and independently in
all the mammals studied. Combined with physical map
data, our phylogenetic studies indicate that the expansion
of C2H2-ZNF genes that occurred during the evolution of
the five species studied, results from the combined action
of single-gene duplication and multiple gene duplication
(for instances, duplication of all or part of the genes
within a cluster). These duplication events were, however,
counteracted by the loss of individual genes or clusters as
exemplified in several cases where related genes or clusters
found in primates and canids were absent in one or both
of the two rodents studied. Our study represents the first
clear demonstration of the involvement of gene and cluster loss in the evolution of C2H2-ZNF genes and suggests
that during mammalian evolution the duplication events
outnumbered the loss events. Furthermore our results
provide convincing support to the idea that the C2H2ZNF gene family evolved according to a "Birth and Death"
model as proposed by Nei and colleagues [44,45]. According to this model, new genes are created by duplications,
including tandem duplication and block (multigene)
duplication (birth). While certain copies remain relatively
unchanged in the genome for a long time, others diverge
functionally by acquiring a new function. Some are
deleted from the genome or become pseudogenes following deleterious mutations (death through elimination or
inactivation). In the case of C2H2-ZNF genes, pseudogenization seems to be limited as suggested by expression
studies and statistical analysis, which showed positive
selection based on the analysis of specific clusters [27,40].
This sets the C2H2-ZNF family apart from other gene families such as the olfactory receptor gene family [36,46].
Noticeably, gene loss by pseudogenization is prominent
in the olfactory receptor family, with humans accumulating a higher number of pseudogenes as compared to other
primates and mouse [37-39]. These variations in the numbers of pseudogenes and functional genes have been associated with the differential chemosensory dependence in
these species [47,48]. In comparison, beyond their role as
transcription regulators, only a few C2H2-ZNF proteins
have known functions [49]. Further studies of C2H2-ZNF
genes in mammals are needed to shed light on the functional consequences of different repertoires of these genes
in different species. Until now, the clustered organization
of these genes has made knock-out studies in animal
models inefficient, likely due to redundancy. However,
based on a better knowledge of the organization/content
of C2H2-ZNF genes in the various genomes, large chromosomal deletions of pure C2H2-ZNF clusters or other
types of gene disruption or targeting approaches could
provide insights into the functions of these genes in various animals.

Evolution of C2H2-ZNF genes through gain and loss of
finger motifs and N-terminal effector domains
Evidence of the variation in the numbers of zinc finger
motifs among orthologs was previously reported for a
subset of C2H2-ZNF genes on human chromosome 19
and their mouse homologs [18]. It was shown that this
variation is due to both differential duplication of finger
motifs and loss by degeneration. In our study, such variation in the number of zinc finger motifs among orthologs
was observed repeatedly among all five mammals. Since
the zinc finger motifs are flexible, with the ability to bind
DNA, RNA and/or proteins, changes in the sequences of
zinc finger motifs and their number could differentially
alter binding specificities and thus protein function.
Changes in both the number of C2H2-ZNF genes and in
the number of finger motifs in orthologous genes may be
important determinants of species-specific functions.

The rapid evolution of the C2H2-ZNF genes observed in
the mammalian lineage was not limited to the variation in
the number of genes and zinc finger motifs. Variation was
also observed in the presence of N-terminal effector
domains, such as SCAN or KRAB, which could be
accounted for by either gain or loss of these motifs in the
various species. Loss by sequence degeneration of both
the SCAN and the KRAB sequences was confirmed in several cases in our study. In certain cases, loss or gain could
not be distinguished. A puzzling question that remains,
however, is whether gain of KRAB and SCAN sequences
occurred multiple times within C2H2-ZNF genes. It is
indeed difficult to explain why these effector domains are
always found in association with and N-terminal to the
zinc finger motifs of C2H2-ZNF proteins, and that the
SCAN domain is always positioned N-terminally to the
KRAB domain of SCAN-KRAB C2H2-ZNF proteins. Interestingly, by analyzing the exon-intron structure of C2H2ZNF genes from all clusters, we found that most SCAN
and SCAN-KRAB C2H2-ZNF genes have each a typical
exon-intron structure (see Figure 7C and Figure 8A). This
suggests that the acquisition of SCAN and KRAB
sequences by C2H2-ZNF genes are most likely singular
events. This led us to propose a new model described in
Figure 8. Considering that the SCAN domain is present in
all vertebrates and is more ancient than the KRAB domain
which is only present in tetrapods, we suggest that first, a
SCAN-C2H2 ZNF gene was formed in an ancestor of vertebrates through the gain of SCAN sequence and that later,
after the emergence of the tetrapods, the gain of a KRAB
sequence gave rise to a SCAN-KRAB C2H2-ZNF gene (Figure 8B). These two gain events possibly occurred through
an exon-shuffling mechanism. Diversification of the
C2H2-ZNF repertoires from each subfamily then occurred
through on-going gene duplications, and loss by deletion
or degeneration of the SCAN and/or KRAB sequences. As
implied by this model, the birth of the SCAN-KRAB

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:176

C2H2-ZNF subfamily occurred earlier than that of the
KRAB C2H2-ZNF subfamily. This is consistent with previous data showing that SCAN-KRAB-ZNF genes do not
group together onto one evolutionary clade but intermix
with KRAB-ZNF genes in phylogenetic trees of the KRAB
sequence [18,27,27]. On the whole, our model is in agreement with the fact that C2H2-ZNF orthologs often belong
to different C2H2-ZNF subfamilies as defined by domains
and with our observation of intermingling within many
C2H2-ZNF clusters of C2H2-ZNF genes from the SCAN,
KRAB and SCAN-KRAB subfamilies. Our study clearly
indicates that the evolution of C2H2-ZNF subfamilies is
tightly linked and stresses that the assignment of proper
orthology requires comprehensive analysis of all C2H2ZNF genes rather than the individual analysis of specific
C2H2-ZNF subfamilies. It also points to the importance
of loss/contraction, whose role in the dynamics of evolution is often underestimated. The underlying mechanisms
in the expansion of C2H2-ZNF genes and the functional
consequences of variation in their repertoires across mammals are yet unclear. It may be that these variations contribute to changes in the control of gene expression/
chromatin compaction leading to species-specific morphogenetic programs or cognitive functions in animals.

Methods
Collection of human C2H2 zinc finger genes
We conducted an extensive similarity search to identify
the complete repertoire of C2H2-ZNF genes in the human
genome (assembly NCBI 36). First, we identified all the
genes annotated as C2H2 and/or Kruppel zinc finger
genes by performing an initial text term search via Entrez
[50]. Second, we used PROSITE [51] to identify all the
proteins which had a zinc finger motif of the C2H2 type
as well as the N-terminal effector domain, if present.

From these searches, the genomic coordinates, chromosome number, position on the chromosome, number of
fingers and identified domains were collected for each of
the gene and protein sequences (initial dataset). A
TBLASTN [52] search (e-value cutoff 1e-3) was done
against the genome using each of the gene sequences from
the initial dataset as a query. The blast hits were used to
generate the final dataset of all the identified C2H2-ZNF
genes (see Additional File 1).
Identification of C2H2-ZNF gene clusters in the human
genome
We analyzed the relative positions of C2H2-ZNF genes in
the human genome in order to identify the C2H2-ZNF
clusters. A distribution of the distances between neighboring C2H2-ZNF genes in the human genome is presented
in Additional File 6. Two consecutive C2H2-ZNF genes
are said to belong to a cluster if the distance between them
is ≤ 500 Kbp regardless of the presence of other genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/176

within the cluster, a threshold classically used in gene
family studies [36]. Clusters were determined for each
human chromosome. For the cluster name, the first
number corresponds to the chromosome number on
which the cluster is found and the second to the number
attributed to the cluster.
Identification of mammalian C2H2-ZNF clusters
syntenically homologous to human clusters
We searched for clusters homologous to the human
C2H2-ZNF clusters (i.e. syntenically homologous clusters) in other mammals for which complete genome
sequences are available. The assemblies used for Pan troglodytes, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus and Canis familiaris
were chimpanzee Pan Tro- 2.1, mouse NCBI m36, rat
RGSC 3.4 and dog Can Fam 2.0. We used the linkage
maps of Ensembl [53]; assignment of syntenic clusters is
based on the genes flanking each human cluster and
which were mapped in all the species. Four flanking genes
at each extremity were mapped in most instances. Then,
we conducted TBLASTN analysis of the syntenic regions
comprised between the flanking genes, using as queries
the amino acid sequence of the zinc finger region from all
the human C2H2-ZNF genes from the corresponding
region identified in this study. A hit with e-value ≤ 1e-4
confirmed the respective homologous clusters in the five
mammalian genomes. A comprehensive catalogue of the
human C2H2-ZNF clusters and their syntenic counterparts in other mammals is compiled in Additional File 4.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using the amino
acid sequences of the zinc finger region (identified using
PROSITE) of C2H2-ZNF genes from selected human clusters and their syntenically homologous clusters in chimpanzee, mouse, rat and dog. Genes containing less than
three zinc finger motifs were not considered in the phylogenetic analysis (noise is expected to be too high if
sequences of only 56 amino acids corresponding to 2 fingers motifs or less were included-yellow goes to methods).
All multiple sequence alignments of the zinc finger
regions of the C2H2-ZNF genes were generated using the
program MUSCLE [54]. To resolve the challenging issue of
comparing sequences containing multiple copies of a
repeated finger motif sequence, that vary in copy number
from gene to gene and whose patterns of duplication may
differ from one species to the other, we used the following
procedure. As a first step, we performed a multiple alignment of all the zinc finger regions of the C2H2-ZNF genes
of interest; we removed all the sequences that were not
unambiguously alignable and generated a new alignment
allowing to visualize sequence similarity between the finger motifs of the various genes. As a second step, we performed individual pair-wise alignments of all the genes
used in the first step. Then, we conducted a multiple align-

ment of the individual finger motifs from all C2H2-ZNF
genes, to then determine if the similar finger motifs from
a given C2H2-ZNF gene group together. The final alignment was derived from the above three alignments combined and then edited to remove gaps using the program
GBLOCKS [55]. Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
Inference (BI) methods were used to infer the phylogenetic trees and estimate the clade support. For ML analysis, the program RAxML (RAxML-VI-HPC Version 2.2.1)
[56] employing the WAG model of amino acid substitution was used to reconstruct the best tree. Bootstrapping
of 100 datasets was implemented. The posterior probabilities were determined by a Bayesian MCMC method
implemented in the program Mr. Bayes v.3.1 [57] to test
the robustness of the topology of the tree inferred through
ML. One million generations were run and the trees were
sampled after every 10 generations.

cant identity with the nucleotide sequence of the domain
of interest. For this purpose, we conducted a BLAST analysis of the individual exon and intron sequences with the
nucleotide sequence of the various domains that are
present in the corresponding orthologs.

Additional material
To determine an appropriate outgroup for our analysis,
we searched the nr database to look for close homologs in
non-mammals using TBLASTN (e-value cut off 1e-4). In
addition to the Xfin sequence from Xenopus laevis, we
obtained a set of zinc finger genes from Chicken (Gallus
gallus, Assembly WASHUC2) specifically selected for each
human C2H2-ZNF cluster based on an extensive similarity search. To select the chicken outgroup, a TBLASTN (evalue cutoff 1e-4) search was done against the chicken
genome using each of the human C2H2-ZNF sequences
derived from the selected cluster of interest as a query. The
top 10 hits for each query sequence were all analysed
using a CD-HIT analysis (Identity threshold = 100%, 95%
and 90%) [58] to produce a final set of non-redundant
representative chicken sequences, all used as a part of the
outgroup.
Sequence analysis to confirm the loss of domains
In the case where loss of a domain was suspected, we conducted an extensive sequence analysis to rule out the possibility that these domains had remained undetected
either due to a frame-shift or inadequate exon-intron
splicing of the gene and thus inappropriate translation,
preventing recognition by PROSITE [51]. Firstly, for each
particular C2H2-ZNF genes where loss of an N-terminal
domain was suggested, we systematically collected the
nucleotide sequence of the region ranging from the stop
of translation of the previous gene to the start of translation of the next gene. We conducted a TBLASTN search of
this region using the amino acid sequence of the domain
of interest (present in the corresponding orthologs and
the consensus of the domains selected from randomly
selected sequences) as a query to confirm the absence of
the domain in the C2H2-ZNF gene of interest. Secondly,
we obtained the exon-intron structure of these genes using
the Ensembl Genome Browser [53], in order to search for
exonic or intronic sequences which may exhibit signifi-
