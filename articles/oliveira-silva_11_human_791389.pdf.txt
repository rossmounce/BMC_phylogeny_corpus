Human Papillomavirus in Brazilian women with
and without cervical lesions
Michelle Oliveira-Silva1†, Camila X Lordello2,3†, Lucília MG Zardo4, Cibele R Bonvicino1,3, Miguel AM Moreira3*

Abstract
Background: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) high-risk (HR) types are the causal factor for cervical cancer and
premalignant dysplasia. Data on frequency of HPV types provide a basis to design and evaluate HPV prevention
programs. Taking into account the heterogeneity of HPV types across and within populations this study aims to
access the HPV frequency in Brazilian women.
Results: We identified 24 different types of HPV, including a Betapapillomavirus and a likely new type, previously
reported, from 132 women positive for the virus analysed by Hybrid Capture II assay. These women were infected
by a single or multiple HPV types and 142 HPV strains were identified. HR types were found in 75% of women and
HPV types 16, 18, 45, 58, and 66 had the highest frequency. Significant differences in frequency of HR HPV types
were found for presence of cervical lesions, and for different HPV species and women age.
Conclusions: Compared with previous studies in Brazil, our data indicated differences in frequency and HPV type
diversity, a significant association of other HR-types but HPV16 and 18 and cervical lesions, and a trend for distinct
distribution of HPV types by age.

Background
Cervical cancer accounts for the third highest mortality
amongst cancers in women worldwide, with a higher
incidence and frequency in underdeveloped and developing countries [1]. The etiology of cervical cancer,
attributed to the high-risk types (HR) of Human Papillomavirus (HPV), has been well established by experimental and epidemiological studies [2-4]. Due to the
discovery of more than 100 HPV types and the association of some types with cancer, pre-cancerous lesions
and genital warts [5], a series of assays based on Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) amplification and nucleic
acid hybridization were designed for HPV detection.
HPV16 and HPV18 are the most types reported,
accounting for approximately 70% of all cervical cancers
[6] and are also frequent in women lacking cytological
abnormalities in different continents [7,8].
The high frequency of HPV16 and HPV18 in cervical
cancer and pre-cancerous lesions lead to development
of vaccines against L1 viral capsid proteins of these

types [9,10]. However, the distribution and prevalence of
HR-HPV types have been shown to vary among populations worldwide [7,11-13] and also in Brazil [14-24],
where most of studies were performed in Southeast
region, employing different methodologies for HPV
detection and typing showing, particularly for HPV18,
the largest variation in prevalence [25]. Considering the
use of different methodologies for HPV typing, the
DNA sequencing is the only procedure capable to
recognize all HPV types and variants present in a biological specimen. Despite of direct sequencing is not adequate for the identification of multiple infections,
preferentially detecting types over-represented in a sample [26], this method has been used in many studies on
HPV prevalence [27-30].
Taking in account that the characterization of HPV
types will be valuable to implement immunization
polices and to monitor the presence of different HPV
types, the present study aim to accesses the diversity of
HPV types in women from communities of low socioeconomic status of the Metropolitan region of the city of
Rio de Janeiro city, Brazil.

Methods
Study Subjects

We studied women from Duque de Caxias and Nova
Iguaçu, two municipalities with low socioeconomic status in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, assisted by the
governmental Family Health Program. They had been
visited by trained health care professionals and invited
to participate in studies for evaluating the efficacy of different methods for detecting cervical lesions [31], and
the Hybrid Capture II (HCII) assay for early detection of
cervical cancer [32], and also the quality of records on
cervical cancer in Brazil [33]. Socio-demographic, cytological data and endocervical samples of these women,
collected between December 2001 and July 2002, were
used in the present study. Pap tests had not been carried
out in any of these women in the last three years before
sample collections; they had not been pregnant, had not
given birth at least six months before inclusion, have
had sexual relation, had not gone through hysterectomy,
and were between 25 and 59 years of age. Endocervical
samples were obtained using a conical-shaped brush and
stored at -20°C in Digene Specimen Transport Medium™
under denaturing conditions. In this present study, only
HPV+ women diagnosed previously by HCII assay were
analyzed, totalizing 297 women. This study was
approved by the Ethics Committee of the Instituto
Nacional de Câncer (registration number 19/05).
The conventional cytology results was classified
according to the recommendations of Brazilian Ministry
of Health and Brazilian Society of Cytology [26], which
is based on Bethesda’s definition [34].
Extraction, Amplification and HPV DNA Typing

Samples were submitted to pH neutralization step with
addition of HCl 1N. DNA isolation was carried out with
QIAamp DNA Mini and Blood Kit (QIAGEN, Helden,
Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions,
modified at the elution step that was performed with
30 μL of AE buffer.
HPV DNA amplification was performed by nestedPCR with MY09/11 [35] and GP05/06+ [36] primers,
the amplicons were purified with the Illustra GFX PCR
and Gel Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare, UK)
before being submitted to direct sequencing, using Big
Dye Terminator Kit V3.1 (Applied Biosystems), in a ABI
3730 sequencer at the Genomic DNA Sequencing Platform (PDTIS) of FIOCRUZ [37]. The samples that
could not be typed by direct sequencing due to overlap
of sequence-peaks were cloned with pMOSBlue Blunt
Ended kit (GE Healthcare, UK) and eight clones were
sequenced for each patient.
Identification of HPV types was carried out with the
Blast software http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi
and by phylogenetic analysis within the MEGA 4.0

Page 2 of 6

software [38] applying Neighbor-Joining and Kimura’s2-Parameter (K2P) distance model. Phylogenetic
analysis included reference sequences from Alphapapillomavirus. Sequences from Betapapillomavirus and
Deltapapillomavirus were used as outgroups. The
strength of each node was evaluated by bootstrap test
with 1,000 replicates. HPV types were epidemiologically and phylogenetically classified following Muñoz
et al [5] and de Villiers et al [39], respectively.
Statistical Analysis

Association between HPV types and cytology results for
women with single infection was performed with the c2
test. Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used
to analyze differences between age at diagnoses and
HPV type for all women.

Results
A total of 297 women positive for HCII assay had samples available for DNA isolation and 132 of these had
HPV DNA successfully amplified. Despite this, there
were no significant differences in respect to the cytological results (ASCUS, AGUS, LSIL and HSIL) and age
between women that had HPV DNA successfully
amplified and those that not had. The mean age of the
132 women were 39.5 years, ranging from 25 to 59
years of age.
A total of 123 women had the HPV type identified
totalizing 142 HPV sequences corresponding to women
infected with single, multiple HPV types or by different
strains of the same type (GenBank accession numbers
HQ834551 - HQ834692). Infections by multiple HPV
types or by different strains were found among the 39
women that could not be typed by direct sequencing
due to overlap of sequence-peaks and were submitted to
molecular cloning and clone sequencing. HPV typing
carried out with Blast and confirmed by phylogenetic
analysis showed the presence of 24 different HPV types,
including HPV17, a Betapapillomavirus often identified
in cutaneous lesions [39], and a new likely type previously reported as SW1 [40]. One hundred and twelve
women were found to be infected by a single HPV type
and 11 showed co-infection, 9 of which by two types
and two by three types. Among 132 women that had
the HPV type amplified, 63.6% (84/132) had no cervical
lesions, 14.4% (19/132) had atypical squamous cells of
undetermined significance (ASCUS) or atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance (AGUS), 9.8% (13/
132) had low-grade squamous intraephitelial lesion
(LSIL) and 19.7% (26/132) had high-grade squamous
intraephitelial lesion (HSIL) (Table 1).
The frequency of HPV HR-types among HPV+
women was 75% (99/132 women), with a highest frequency for HPV16 (28%; 37/132), followed by HPV18

(14.4%; 19/132), HPV45 (7.6%; 10/132), HPV58 (6.8%; 9/
132), HPV66 (6.8%; 9/132), HPV31 (3.8%; 5/132) and
HPV33 (3.0%; 4/132). Considering only the 84 HPV+
women with normal cytology, we found frequencies of
28.6% (24/84) for HPV16 and 19.0% (16/84) for HPV18.
A significant lower proportion of LSIL and HSIL was
found among women infected by HPV16 and/or HPV18
when compared to the ones infected by other HR-types
(c2 test, p = 0.0411). Our data also showed that infection by alpha-7 (including HPV18, 39, 45, 59, 68 and
70) and alpha-9 species (including HPV16, 31, 33, 35,
52, 58 and 67) presented a significant distinct distribution by age at diagnosis respective to women positive
for other HPV types (Mann-Whitney test, p = 0.0187)

(Figure 1). However, separate comparisons among
alpha-7 infections, alpha-9 infection, and infections by
other HPV types, did not show a significant different
distribution by age (Kruskal-Wallis test, p = 0.06).

Discussion and Conclusions
All cervical samples included in the present study were
HPV+ by the HCII assay, which include probes for detection of 18 Alphapapillomavirus types (HR types: HPV16,
18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 68; LR types:
HPV6, 11, 42, 43 and 44). However, we identified 12 HPV
types (HPV17, 30, 53, 66, 70, 72, 74, 82, 83, 89, 90 and
SW1) not included in that set of probes. These findings
reinforced previous evidence of cross-hybridizations

among probes used in HCII test [41-45]. Interestingly, the
Betapapillomavirus HPV17 was also identified, a type
frequently associated to cutaneous lesions, indicating
that probes contained in the HCII test were capable of
cross-hybridizing with viruses not belonging to
Alphapapillomavirus.
In Brazil, most studies on HPV frequency used as
inclusion criteria the suspicion of HPV infection, presence of cervical lesions or cancer. In our study, these
criteria were not used, a reason why we compared our
findings with studies with similar inclusion criteria
[15,19-24]. Three of these studies were performed in
Northeast region, two in the same city (Recife), and the
HPV frequency reported were discrepant among them
and also in comparison with our study. Franco et al
[21], carried out a study with 122 HPV+ in João Pessoa
city, using dot blot hybridization method for typing and
found a lower frequency of HPV45 (3.1%) and higher
frequency of HPV33 (13.5%) than here reported (7.6%
and 3.0%, respectively). In Recife city, Lorenzato et al
[22] analyzing 214 HPV+ women and using PCR/RFLP
for HPV typing, found a higher frequency of HPV31
(21.4%) and a lower frequency of HPV18 (2.4%) in comparison with our findings (3.8% and 14.4%, respectively).
The third study by Baldez et al [20], also conducted in
Recife, analyzed 213 HPV+ women using specific primers for PCR amplification of four HPV types and
found a higher frequency of HPV16 (78%) and HPV31
(15.5%), and lower frequency of HPV18 (2.8%) in respect

to our data (28.0% of HPV16; 3.8% of HPV31 and 14.4%
of HPV18).
In a study performed in Metropolitan region of Rio de
Janeiro city at the Southeast region of Brazil, Oliveira
et al [19] analyzing 82 HPV+ young women (between
14 to 26 years old), using PCR/RFLP for HPV typing,
reported a higher frequency of HPV31 (12.2%) than the
one found by us (3.8%), and accounting for the second
most frequent type after HPV16. In addition, a lower
frequency for HPV16 (18.3%) and HPV18 (2.4%) were
observed in comparison to our data (28.0% and 14.4%,
respectively). In state of São Paulo, also in Southeast
region of Brazil, Lippman et al [15], analyzed 135 HPV+
women of 18 to 40 years of age, and employing PCR/
RFLP for HPV typing, detected a large diversity of HPV
types with lower frequencies for HPV16 (17%), HPV45
(2.2%), HPV58 (4.4%) and HPV66 (2.2%) in comparison
to our data (28.0% for HPV16; 7.6% for HPV45; 6.8%
for HPV58 and 6.8% for HPV66).
In two studies performed at the South region of Brazil,
the first by Krambeck et al [24] in the state of Santa
Catarina, using PCR/RFLP for HPV typing, in 29 HPV+
women, and the second by Rosa et al [23] in the state of
Rio Grande do Sul, using specific primers for typing
HPV16, HPV18, and HPV31, in 179 HPV+ women,
reported lower frequencies for HPV16 (17.2% and
18.6%, respectively) than the found here (28.0%). However, the second most frequent types identified in these
studies (HPV53 with 10.3% and HPV31 with 15.8%,
respectively) were found with higher frequencies than in
our study (HPV53 with 3.0% and HPV31 with 3.8%).
Furthermore, the HPV18 was not reported in state of
Santa Catarina although this type has been found in the
state of Rio Grande do Sul with lower frequency (3.3%)
than the observed by us (14.4%).
Concerning the 84 HPV+ women with normal cytology, we found a higher frequency of HPV16 (28.6%;
24/84) and HPV18 (19.0%; 16/84) than in a meta-analysis, restricted to women with normal cytology, carried
out for South America [7] with 15% and 5%, respectively. In addition, this meta-analysis found a frequency
of 7% for HPV58, the second most frequent type, similarly to our sample (6.0%; 5/84) in which this type was
the fourth most frequent. These data provide a complementary picture to studies of HPV type distribution in
women with cancer or precancerous lesions.
Our results indicated a trend for a higher proportion
of lesions in women infected by HR-types other than
HPV16 and/or HPV18, indicating that other HR-HPVs
must also be considered for further implement appropriate immunization and monitoring policies. Moreover,
the considerable difference in frequency of HPV types
amongst previous studies (e.g.: ranging from 17.2% to
78.7% for HPV16, and from 0% to 14.4% for HPV18,

Oliveira-Silva et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:4
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/4

among HPV+ women), evidences the need to further
investigations to improve information of geographical
distribution of HPV types in Brazil using standardized
methodologies to HPV detection and typing.
