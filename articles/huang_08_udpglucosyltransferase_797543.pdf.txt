Abstract
Background: Glucosidation plays a major role in the inactivation and excretion of a great variety
of both endogenous and exogenous compounds. A class of UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs) is
involved in this process. Insect UGTs play important roles in several processes, including
detoxication of substrates such as plant allelochemicals, cuticle formation, pigmentation, and
olfaction. Identification and characterization of Bombyx mori UGT genes could provide valuable
basic information for this important family and explain the detoxication mechanism and other
processes in insects.
Results: Taking advantage of the newly assembled genome sequence, we performed a genomewide analysis of the candidate UGT family in the silkworm, B. mori. Based on UGT signature and
their similarity to UGT homologs from other organisms, we identified 42 putative silkworm UGT
genes. Most of them are clustered on the silkworm chromosomes, with two major clusters on
chromosomes 7 and 28, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis of these identified 42 UGT protein
sequences revealed five major groups. A comparison of the silkworm UGTs with homologs from
other sequenced insect genomes indicated that some UGTs are silkworm-specific genes. The
expression patterns of these candidate genes were investigated with known expressed sequence
tags (ESTs), microarray data, and RT-PCR method. In total, 36 genes were expressed in tissues
examined and showed different patterns of expression profile, indicating that these UGT genes
might have different functions.
Conclusion: B. mori possesses a largest insect UGT gene family characterized to date, including 42
genes. Phylogenetic analysis, genomic organization and expression profiles provide an overview for
the silkworm UGTs and facilitate their functional studies in future.

Background
All organisms live in an environment that contains natural and man-made potentially harmful chemicals. Extensive studies of detoxification in the vertebrate liver
provide a framework to the study of detoxification mech-

anisms in other systems [1-3]. Several biotransformation
enzymes participate in the detoxification process, they are
cytochrome P450 superfamily [4,5], short chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR)1 family [6], glutathione S-transferases [7] and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases [2].

Biotransformation enzymes related to those found in vertebrates have also been found in insects and are likely to
play equally important roles. Cytochrome P450s and glutathione S-transferases in particular have been implicated
in insect resistance to pesticides [8]. UDP-glucuronosyltransferases are part of a superfamily of UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs, EC2.4.1.-) that are found in all living
organisms, including animals, plants, bacteria and
viruses, suggesting an ancient origin [9-11]. UGTs are a
superfamily of enzymes that mediate the transfer of glycosyl residues from activated nucleotide sugars to acceptor
molecules (aglycones), thus regulating properties of the
acceptors such as their bioactivity, solubility and transport
within the cell and throughout the organism. The UDPsugar may be UDP-glucuronic acid, UDP-galactose, UDPglucose, or UDP-xylose.
The mammalian UGTs using UDP-glucuronic acid as a
glycosyl donor have attracted considerable attention in
pharmaceutical and clinical research due to their central
role in the detoxification of foreign chemicals such as carcinogens and hydrophobic drugs. These enzymes are
located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and
are membrane-bound protein. In addition to the detoxication of exogenous substrates, they are involved in a
range of other physiological processes, including olfaction and metabolism of bile acids and steroids [12].
Like plant UGTs, insect UGT enzymes also use UDP-glucose rather than UDP-glucuronic acid as sugar donor [1315]. Also, similar to the vertebrates, both endogenous and
exogenous substrates are subject to glucosidation in
insects. UGT activity on endogenous and exogenous compounds has been reported in a range of insect species [16].
Insect UGTs play an important role in detoxication of
plant allelochemicals encountered by many insects in
their diets [14]. Consequently, UGT-catalyzed biotransformation of xenobiotics has been implicated in some
cases of insecticide resistance [17]. In addition, insect
UGTs play important roles in several processes, including
cuticle formation, pigmentation, and olfaction [18-20].
However, only limited molecular information on insect
UGTs is available.
Genome sequencing projects offer a new route into understanding multigene families both within a single species
and across different species. In the present study, we have
used the newly assembled 9× coverage genome sequence
http://silkworm.swu.edu.cn/silkdb/ to characterize the
UGT multigene family in silkworm. In total, the 42 putative silkworm UGTs were identified. The phylogenetic
relationships among these genes and the homologs from
the sequenced insect genomes were analyzed. Searching
available ESTs and microarray data, we found that 36 of
42 silkworm UGTs were expressed in different tissues, sug-

gesting that these genes are active and may have different
functions. In addition, the genomic structures of silkworm UGT genes were also investigated. Our data provide
the preliminary insights into evolution and functions of
the silkworm UGTs. This is the first time to describe this
gene family in a Lepidoptera species. The results may have
important implications for the study of insect UGTs.

Results
The UGT family number of silkworm
A signature sequence involved in the binding of the UDP
moiety of the nucleotide sugar has been identified as a
characteristic of UGT sequences from a range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. To gain insight into the size
of the UGT family in the silkworm, the amino acid
sequence corresponding to this signature motif in insect
UGTs was used to screen the predicted silkworm protein
database. The reported amino acid sequences of Drosophila melanogaster UGTs were also used as queries for the
BLASTP searches. We ultimately identified 42 UGT genes
from the silkworm genome (Table 1). The signature
motifs are well conserved in the silkworm UGT genes (Figure 1). Similarly, we also identified 22 and 12 UGT genes
from Anopheles gambiae and Apis mellifera genomes,
respectively. It has been reported that there are 33 UGTs
in the D. melanogaster genome. It is obvious that the B.
mori genome contains more members of the UGT family
compared with A. gambiae, A. mellifera, and D. melanogaster. Among all of the identified silkworm UGT
sequences, the N-terminal region is more variable than
the C-terminal region where the signature sequence
resides.
Phylogeny of the silkworm UGT superfamily
Phylogenetic tree of silkworm UGTs was reconstructed by
the neighbor-joining (NJ) method using a conserved Cterminal region. 5 major groups were defined by this
method with high bootstrap supports, we named them
groups I-V (Figure 2). Group I contains 12 UGTs; all these
genes are tandem arranged on chromosome 7 (Figure 3).
Group II contains 3 UGTs; BmUGT003817 and
BmUGT003835 are located on chromosome 24, but
genomic position of BmUGT001338 is unknown due to
the quality of the silkworm genome sequence. Group III
also contains 3 genes; BmUGT005442 and BmUGT005443
are tandem repeated on chromosome 8, while
BmUGT005046 is located on chromosome 25. Group IV
contains 6 UGTs; except for that the genomic locations of
BmUGT014622 and BmUGT1566 are unknown, other 4
genes are located on chromosome 18 (Figure 3). Group V
is the largest group that contains 16 genes; 13 of them are
tandem arranged on chromosome 28 (Figure 3), and
BmUGT009788, BmUGT007327, and BmUGT004965 are
located on chromosomes 2, 3 and 25, respectively. Gene
BmUGT002854 is located on chromosome 10, and it has

Multiple sequence alignment was performed with CLUSTALW and amino-acid shading with BOXSHADE 3.21 http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/BOX_form.html. A consensus is indicated in the region of the
UGT signature sequence. (FVA)-(LIVMF)-(TS)-(HQ)-(SGAC)-G- X(2) -(STG)-X(2)- (DE)-X(6)-P-(LIVMFA)-(LIVMFA)-X(2)-P(LMVFIQ)-X(2)- (DE)-Q, (all amino acids that can concur at a given position are listed inside brackets; X indicted any amino
acid; reviewed in [10])

the special intron position (Figure 4). The phylogenetic
analysis also shows that this gene was not clustered with
other silkworm UGT genes. Most of members of group I

come from the same chromosome, whereas groups II and
V are composed of genes located on different chromosomes.

Compared with D. melanogaster (33 UGTs), A. gambiae
(22 UGTs), and A. mellifera (12 UGTs), the silkworm
UGTs were greatly expanded in number. From the molecular phylogenetic tree of B. mori, D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, A. mellifera UGTs (Figure 2) we can see that group C,
D, and E, which defined by D. melanogaster UGTs, were
Diptera-specific classes, and that they were clustered by D.
melanogaster and A. gambiae UGTs only. The silkworm
groups III and IV are clustered with D. melanogaster groups
A and B, respectively, and each cluster also contains A.
gambiae and A. mellifera UGT genes. This indicates that
group A and B are common in Lepidoptera, Diptera and
Hymenoptera. In group A, BmUGT005046 was a probable
ortholog of Am15665 because they were phylogenetically
closely related (bootstrap value of 95%). BmUGT005046,
BmUGT005442,
BmUGT005443,
and
Am12751,
Am15163, Am12492, Am10367 formed a cluster, supported by a bootstrap value 67% (Figure 2), suggesting
that these genes may have a common ancestor. In addition, BmUGT005442 and BmUGT005443 are tandem
repeated on chromosome 8. Thus, BmUGT005442 and
BmUGT005443 might be created through local duplication. The similar phenomenon was also observed in
group B. Groups I, II, and V were silkworm-specific
classes. They did not form respective clusters with other
insect UGTs; genes of each group were tandem repeated
on chromosomes. This indicated that most of UGTs might
experience lineage-specific expansion in the silkworm.
Genomic distribution of UGTs in silkworm
39 of the 42 identified silkworm UGT genes were dispersed on 10 chromosomes and 3 genes on unmapped
scaffolds. The distinctive feature of the silkworm UGT
family is the grouping of genes into clusters with size ranging from 1 to 13 genes per cluster on different chromosomes (Figure 3) (The chromosomes with less than 3
UGTs not shown). The genes in any particular cluster
often show a high degree of sequence similarity each
other. There are two major gene clusters, located on chromosomes 7 and 28, which contain 12 and 13 genes,
respectively. In addition, there are 4 UGT genes located on
chromosome 18. Each of chromosomes 8 and 24 contains
2 UGT genes, while each of chromosomes 2, 3, 10, 12,
and 25 has one gene.

There are also clear examples of transpositional gene
duplications in the silkworm UGT family. For example,
BmUGT005046, BmUGT005442, and BmUGT005443
were of the same group III but located on different chromosomes. In the group V, the gene BmUGT004965,
BmUGT007327, and BmUGT009788 are respectively
located on chromosomes 25, 3, and 2.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/563

Intron gain and loss as well as intron positions and sizes of
silkworm UGTs
Our study revealed that all of 42 silkworm UGTs contained introns. Comparing intron positions with
sequence relationships revealed by phylogenetic analysis,
about eight independent intron insertion events appear to
have happened in the course of the silkworm UGT evolution (Figure 4). The widespread and probably the oldest
intron is intron 6, which is found in all of 42 silkworm
UGT genes. All other introns are found to be gained or lost
only within a single restricted subgroup or in only a single
gene. This suggests a general pattern of intron gain during
evolution of the UGT gene family. A clear case of one
recent intron loss is seen in the group I. Eight genes of this
group contain 7 introns, while other four genes have 6
introns. It is likely that the lost one is intron 7, which
exists in all other 38 UGTs. This implies that an intron loss
event might have occurred after the gene duplication.

In total, at least 180 introns could be identified for the 42
silkworm UGT genes (Figure 4). Each group revealed by
phylogenetic analysis almost has the same intron number
and the intron positions. Most members of group I have 7
introns with numbers from 2 to 8, while genes
BmUGT010295, BmUGT010098, BmUGT010099, and
BmUGT010099-2 contain 6 introns, which lost intron 7.
The members of group II also contain 7 introns and their
intron positions are the same as those of the group I. Each
gene of group III contains 3 introns and their intron positions are 3, 6, and 7. Each gene of groups IV and V also
contains 3 introns, but the intron positions were different
from group III; they were 6, 7, and 8 (Figure 4).
BmUGT002854 contains 6 introns. This gene has the special intron position 1. The silkworm UGTs have more
introns compared with Drosophila UGTs.
Intron size of silkworm UGTs ranged from several decades
bp to ten thousands bp, and its average was about 1700
bp. About 58.3% of the silkworm UGT introns have sizes
> 1000 bp. The silkworm UGTs have longer introns compared with the introns of D. melanogaster UGTs (Figure 5),
which the majority of introns were 50–99 bp long.
Expression of silkworm UGT genes
The expression of the identified silkworm UGT genes was
analyzed with known ESTs and microarray data. Of all
putative silkworm UGT genes, 29 have expression evidence confirmed by microarray data and 24 have EST evidence. In total, 36 genes were expressed. According to
microarray analysis we know that 21 genes have transcribed activity. Among them 16 genes were transcribed in
midgut. BmUGT013829, BmUGT014622, BmUGT001338,
BmUGT003817, and BmUGT003835 were widely
expressed in silkworm tissues. Some genes were expressed
in a tissue-specific pattern, for example, BmUGT004965

and BmUGT010289 were specifically expressed in silk
gland. BmUGT013834 and so on were merely expressed in
midgut. While BmUGT013860-2, BmUGT010100 and
BmUGT002854 were only expressed in two tissues midgut
and malpighian tubules. However, eight genes were not
expressed in 3-day-old fifth-instar larvae tissues based on
microarray data, such as BmUGT013833, BmUGT010288
and BmUGT005442 (Figure 6). The RT-PCR was also done
to analyze tissue expression patterns of some representative UGT genes on the fifth-instar day 3 larvae. The tissues
included testis, ovary, head, integument, fat body, midgut, haemocyte, malpighian tubules and silk glands,

which the same with microarray data detected. The results
further confirmed these observations (Figure 7A).

Discussion
Taking advantage of the newly assembled silkworm
genome sequence, we identified the 42 putative members
of UGT genes, including a reported silkworm UGT gene.
The number of UGT genes in silkworm is larger than D.
melanogaster UGTs, which contain 33 genes [21]. While in
plant of Arabidopsis there are about 120 UGTs and mammalian UGT gene superfamily currently has 117 members, they are all quite larger number than insects [22].

Both plant and mammalian UGT sequences contained a
signature sequence–a UDP-glycosyltransferase signature:
(FVA) - (LIVMF) - (TS) - (HQ) - (SGAC) - G - X(2)- (STG)
-X(2)- (DE) - X(6) - P - (LIVMFA) - (LIVMFA) - X(2) - P (LMVFIQ) -X(2)- (DE) - Q (all amino acids that can occur
at a given position are listed inside brackets; X indicated
any amino acid [11]). It was reported that this motif has
been identified in a range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic
organisms. There is no exception of insects UGTs. The signature motif is located on C-terminal of the protein
sequence.
So far all the identified UGTs comprise two major functional domains [23]. The N-terminal half, believed to be
responsible for binding the aglycone, tends to be less conserved than the C-terminal half, which is thought to bind
the UDP-sugar. Aglycones bound by UGTs are highly
diverse, hence the low amino acid sequence conservation
in the N-terminal region between the members of this
family. The silkworm UGTs followed the same pattern,
with the C-terminal half showing the highest similarity to
other UGTs.
The best-characterised UGTs are the mammalian UDPglucuronosyltransferases, which transfer glucuronic acid
to hydrophobic substrates. These enzymes localized in the
lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and are membrane-

bound [24]. Mammalian UGTs have two functional
motifs are thought to be important for the topology of
proteins within the cell. One is the mammalian UGTs
contain the N-terminal signal sequence cleaved on
cotranslational segregation into the endoplasmic reticulum [25,26]. The other is the putative hydrophobic transmembrane domain located near the carboxyl terminus of
the protein, this domain anchors the enzymes to the
membrane region [27,25,28,29]. The major portion of the
protein is located in the ER lumen, including the proposed substrate-binding domains and the catalytic site.
The silkworm UGTs also have these domains, an N-terminus signal sequence and hydrophobic transmembrane
domain either in N-terminal or C-terminal or in both terminals. Thus, these genes are most likely to be anchored
in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, no such motif
was identified in Arabidopsis UGTs [22], supporting that
the plant UGTs are cytoplasmic enzymes, different from
insect and mammalian UGTs.
42 members of the silkworm UGT gene family scattered
on 10 chromosomes. Phylogenetic analysis of these genes
defined 5 consistent groups. The genes on each cluster
often show a high degree of sequence similarity. This suggests that several gene duplication events took place during the evolution of this family. These duplication events
included both tandem events, where the duplicated cop-

events, where one copy is translocated to a different chromosomal location. Examples of both types of event can be
seen in the clade including BmUGT007327,
BmUGT002854 and BmUGT009788.

At least 180 introns were identified in 42 silkworm UGTs;
the average introns number of each gene is 4.5. However,
in D. melanogaster each UGT genes have 1.8 introns, quite
smaller number than silkworm UGTs; the size of UGTs
from the two organisms are similar, all about 500 amino
acids. The increase of number of introns in silkworm

UGTs is probably due to a fact that the silkworm genome
harbors a large proportion of repetitive sequences. And
the majority of these repetitive sequences were transposable elements or the remainders of transposable elements.
Insertions of transposition into the introns might result in
the increase of their lengths.
The micoarray data and RT-PCR results from fifth-instar
day 3 larvae tissues showed that the silkworm UGT genes
exhibited widely different patterns of expression. Different expression profiles indicate that these UGT genes
might have different functions. BmUGT001338 and
BmUGT003817 were expressed in all most tissues and different developmental stages according to microarray data,
this indicated that these genes might have important functions in silkworm development and play the housekeeping role. The RT-PCR results showed that BmUGT010286
were transcripted in all the tissues, just a low expression
was observed in head, silk glands, testis and ovary and
possessed similar tissue expression pattern with BmUGT1,
which reported play a major role in detoxication
responses [30]. In addition the two genes located on the
same chromosome and may have a common ancestor and
phylogenetic tree showed that they were classified into a
sub-group. These indicated that BmUGT010286 might
involved in the detoxication of plant allelochemicals. B.
mori larvae take up flavonoids into their cocoons from the
leaves of their host plant, the mulberry tree (Morus alba)
[31], but the flavonoids in mulberry tree leaves were different from that which isolated from the cocoon shell of
the silkworm [32]. In insects, the formation of glucoside
is the predominant pathway for dietary flavonoids [3336], and the glucosylation of polyphenolics in insects is
catalyzed by UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT) [14,15], B.
mori UGTs changed the flavonoids glucose conjugation
positions from 3-O-glucoside to 5-O-glucoside or other
forms to increase fitness for their own. Since a flavonoid
5-O-glucoside has not yet been reported in plants to other
animals. Transfer a glucose moiety to the C-5 position of
the flavonols, is functioning in B. mori [37]. It also was
reported that quercetin 5-O-glucoside was the predominant metabolite in the midgut tissue, while quercetin 5,4'di-O-glucoside was the major constituent in the haemocyte and silk glands [37]. The genes were highly or specific
expressed in silk glands, midgut and haemlymph such as
BmUGT010289,
BmUGT004965,
BmUGT013859,
BmUGT003835,
BmUGT013829,
BmUGT013830,
BmUGT013860, BmUGT013834, BmUGT010286 might
have functions in flavonoids metabolism in silkworm.
This may be a very important function for silkworm and
further study should be needed to confirm this inference
in future. The RT-PCR results also indicted that
BmUGT003835 gene was highly expressed in testis, ovary,
integument, fat body, midgut, malpighian tubules and
with lower expression in head, but hardly detectable in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/563

haemocyte and silk glands. This expression profile suggested this gene might have some functions in detoxication since the intergument, fat body, and midgut are the
main tissues correspond to such activity. We know little
about what roles this gene plays in the testis and ovary. It
is interesting and worthy of further study. In D. melanogaster, there were several UGT genes involved in olfaction; they were preferentially expressed in the third
antennal segment of D. melanogaster [20]. Both microarray data and RT-PCR indicated that BmUGT013829 has
high expression levels in silkworm head and RT-PCR also
shows that this gene is highly expressed in larval and adult
antennae (Figure 7B), suggesting that this gene may be
involved in olfaction, but the expression of this gene is
not antennae-specific. It can be also detected in fat body
and integument, suggesting this gene may have other
functions. With more and more insects UGT genes were
identified, individual silkworm UGTs functions can initially be determined through bioinformatic studies that
reveal homology to genes encoding enzymes of known
catalytic activity.
It is known that many plant phenolics can act as toxins or
feeding deterrents to insects and thus play an important
role in plant defense against herbivorous insects. The
detoxication of ingested plant phenolics is believed to be
one of the principle functions of insect UGT enzymes
[14]. Compared with A. gambiae, D. melanogaster, and A.
mellifera UGTs, B. mori has more UGTs. Probably this is
the result of competition between silkworm and its only
diet mulberry leaf. In order to defense B. mori, mulberry
leaf can produce some toxicant chemicals, while B. mori
can also evolve some mechanism to detoxicate the chemicals. UGTs probably are involved in this process, so the
number of the silkworm UGTs was expanded and also
produce the silkworm-specific UGT genes.

Conclusion
Biochemical evidence and comparisons with mammalian
and other systems point to a range of important functions
for the UGT genes of this family. Our results indicate that
the B. mori contains the largest insect UGT gene family
characterized to date compared with other insects. The
data presented in this study provide an overview for the
silkworm UGTs and facilitate their functional studies in
future.

Methods
Identification of silkworm UGT members
The new version of the silkworm genome sequence and
predicted protein database were used in the present analysis http://silkworm.swu.edu.cn/silkdb/. Complete protein sequences of A. gambiae and A. mellifera were
downloaded from Ensemble (AgamP3.45) and BeeBase
(release 2), respectively.

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:563

UGT protein sequences of D. melanogaster were downloaded from the GenBank http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
and used as queries to perform BLASTP searches against
the silkworm predicted protein database and TBLASTN
searches against the silkworm 9× genome sequence. A
UGT signature motif in a known silkworm UGT gene and
D. melanogaster UGTs was also used in a TBLASN search.
We collected all the candidates if they have UGT signature
motif that also exists in plants and mammals. We also
used the program SMART to identify whether UDPGT
domain exists in the protein sequences encoding by the
candidate genes. The same methods were used for identification of the A. gambiae and A. mellifera UGT genes.
Genomic sequences that showed even weak sequence
similarity to any query sequence and its flanking regions
were extracted, and put into Softberry database for predicting new genes by using FGENESH program taking the
available insect (A. gambiae, or D. melanogaster, or Tribolium castaneum, or A. mellifera) or the human genome
sequence as a reference. For those fragments which their
complete coding sequence could not be found by above
methods, we used the complete silkworm UGT protein
sequences as queries to perform TBLASTN searches
against the silkworm 9× genome database and defined the
sequence structure by hand.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Multiple sequence alignments were initially made using
the program ClustalX version 1.81 with default gap penalties [38]. These alignments were then reconciled and further adjusted by eye to minimize insertion/deletion
events. A conserved C-terminal region about 240–250
amino acids were used in the subsequent phylogenetic
analyses, which includes the UGT signature motif. Phylogenetic tree were reconstructed using the neighbor-joining
method [39] implemented in MEGA 4.0 program [40].
Bootstrap support was evaluated based on 1000 replicates.
Gene expression analysis with ESTs and microarray data
More than 184201 ESTs from B. mori were available in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
database. To search transcriptional evidence for individual UGT genes, a BLASTN search was conducted against
the silkworm EST database. The putative coding
sequences were used as queries. A 95% or greater identity
and minimum cut-off E-value ( e-20) were employed to
discriminate between duplicated genes. Methods for
microarray data analysis were mainly as described in Xia
et al. (2007) [41].
RNA extraction and RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted both from the fifth-instar day 3
larvae tissues including testes, ovary, head, integument,
fat body, midgut, haemocyte, malpighian tubules, silk

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/563

glands, larval antenna and adult tissues including testis,
wing, baenosome, abdomen, ovary, fat body, adult
antenna using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). The concentration of RNA was calculated by a spectrophotometer
(Gene Spec V: HITACHI, Japan). DNA within RNA samples were digested with RNase-free DNase I. The first
strand of cDNA was synthesized using M-MLV Reverse
Transcriptase following the manufacturer's instructions
(Promega, USA).
The Primers were designed on the basis of the coding
sequences of the silkworm UGTs (see Additional file 1).
Silkworm cytoplasmic actin A3 gene (forward primer: 5'AACACCCCGTCCTGCTCACTG-3'; reverse primer: 5'GGGCGAGACGTGTGATTTCCT-3') was used as an internal control. PCR amplification was performed in a total
reaction volume of 25 l, containing normalized cDNA,
15 pmol of each primer, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.25 mM dNTP, 1×
buffer and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. PCRs were
performed with the following cycles: initial denaturation
at 94°C for 3 min; then followed by 25 cycles of 30 s at
94°C, 1 min annealing (temperatures listed in Additional
file 1), 1.5 min extension (72°C), and a final extension at
72°C for 10 min. The amplification products were analyzed on 1% agarose gels.
