Abstract
Background: α- and β-tubulin are fundamental components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton and
cell division machinery. While overall tubulin expression is carefully controlled, most eukaryotes
express multiple tubulin genes in specific regulatory or developmental contexts. The genomes of
the human parasites Trypanosoma brucei and Leishmania major reveal that these unicellular
kinetoplastids possess arrays of tandem-duplicated tubulin genes, but with differences in
organisation. While L. major possesses monotypic α and β arrays in trans, an array of alternating αand β tubulin genes occurs in T. brucei. Polycistronic transcription in these organisms makes the
chromosomal arrangement of tubulin genes important with respect to gene expression.
Results: We investigated the genomic architecture of tubulin tandem arrays among these
parasites, establishing which character state is derived, and the timing of character transition.
Tubulin loci in T. brucei and L. major were compared to examine the relationship between the two
character states. Intergenic regions between tubulin genes were sequenced from several
trypanosomatids and related, non-parasitic bodonids to identify the ancestral state. Evidence of
alternating arrays was found among non-parasitic kinetoplastids and all Trypanosoma spp.;
monotypic arrays were confirmed in all Leishmania spp. and close relatives.
Conclusion: Alternating and monotypic tubulin arrays were found to be mutually exclusive
through comparison of genome sequences. The presence of alternating gene arrays in non-parasitic
kinetoplastids confirmed that separate, monotypic arrays are the derived state and evolved through
genomic restructuring in the lineage leading to Leishmania. This fundamental reorganisation
accounted for the dissimilar genomic architectures of T. brucei and L. major tubulin repertoires.

Background
Gene expression in kinetoplastids (Euglenozoa) takes a
peculiar form, quite unlike the system of promoter and
terminator signals typical of other eukaryotes. Expression
of several, contiguous loci occurs simultaneously through
polycistronic transcription [1-3] and regulation of individual genes is largely post-transcriptional [4]. Within this

context, an unusually large proportion of kinetoplastid
genes is arranged in tandem gene arrays and includes
transporter proteins [5], surface antigens [6] and the
spliced-leader sequence responsible for cleavage of the
polycistronic pre-mRNA [7]. This study addresses the evolution of α- and β-tubulin arrays in the parasitic kinetoplastids, Trypanosoma spp. and Leishmania spp., with a

comparative genomic approach. These unicellular flagellates are responsible for various human diseases around
the world, namely African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas' disease.
Tubulin is a fundamental constituent of kinetoplastid
cytoskeletons, cell division machinery and motile
organelles [8]. There is a large family of tubulin proteins
but the α/β heterodimer is the essential building material
for the microtubular cytoskeleton [9]. Trypanosomatid
parasites possess an extensive array of cytoplasmic,
mitotic and flagellar microtubules and recent evidence
suggests that tubulin expression varies greatly during the
life cycles of Trypanosoma and Leishmania spp., possibly as
the relative demand for these structures fluctuates [10-14].
Indeed, in certain species, different isoforms of tubulin
may have specific expression profiles related to the parasitic life cycle; for example, L. mexicana has a β-tubulin isoform unique to the amastigote stage found within human
macrophages [15].
Kinetoplastid gene expression is based on polycistronic
transcription, followed by 5' trans-splicing of pre-mRNA
and 3' poly-adenylation to form mature transcripts
[16,17]. A variety of structural motifs in untranscribed
regions have been shown to regulate mRNA levels posttranscriptionally by affecting trans-splicing, RNA-binding
capability and transcript stability [18-23]. Genes do not
generally possess individual promoters and therefore,
cannot be up-regulated through transcriptional initiation.
Instead, where high transcript levels are required, genes
may be duplicated to form tandem gene arrays, which are
co-transcribed. Such dosage effects may explain why tubulin genes, and other genes, such as the paraflagellar rod
proteins [24], are arrayed. However, it also seems possible
for specific isoforms to be differentially expressed through
regulation of particular repeats within the array, or of
additional, non-arrayed (i.e., singleton) loci elsewhere in
the genome [5,15,25,26].
In yeast, equal concentrations of α and β tubulin are
required for normal cellular function [27,28]. Assuming
that such coordination is desirable in trypanosomatids,
the precise arrangement of tubulin genes could be crucial.
Recently completed genome sequences have exposed the
full extent of tandem gene arrays in Trypanosoma brucei
[29] and Leishmania major [30] and these are illustrated in
Figure 1. Tubulin gene arrays have long been known and
used to understand gene regulation in these organisms.
Trypanosoma spp. possess a single array of alternating αand β-tubulin genes [31-35] (see Figure 1(a)), while Leishmania spp. possess separate α-tubulin and β-tubulin
arrays on different chromosomes [36,37] (see Figure
1(b)). The tandem repetition of these two character states
suggests that they are independent solutions to a common

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/261

need. Given that an alternating array is the more intuitive
means of maintaining transcriptional parity between the
α and β heterodimeric tubulins, quite how and why such
a fundamental genomic rearrangement occurred in one or
both lineages requires explanation.
This study examined the genomic architecture of tubulin
tandem arrays in a range of kinetoplastids and combined
this with bioinformatic analyses of various genome
sequences to identify the origin of the two character states
found in Trypanosoma spp. and Leishmania spp. It included
representatives of the three non-parasitic clades within the
Kinetoplastida, the 'bodonids', which together comprise
the natural outgroup of trypanosomatids [38,39]. A phylogeny for tubulin genomic architecture was created to ask
several questions: first, can the relatedness of tubulin loci
be traced through comparison of their genomic positions;
second, what is the polarity of the character transition, i.e.,
is one alternating array or two monotypic arrays the
derived state; and third, if one state is derived, what is the
model for the genomic rearrangement.

Results
Overview
The genomic arrangement of tubulin genes among kinetoplastids was examined in three stages. First, comparison of
the completed genome sequences for T. brucei and L.
major established the relationships between the distinct
tubulin loci in these two organisms. Second, specific and
degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers, able
to amplify the intergenic sequence (IGS) between any
combination of α- and β-tubulin genes in tandem were
designed from sequence alignments spanning the entire
Kinetoplastida. These primers were used for molecular
screening of various species, including the non-parasitic
bodonids. Third, bioinformatic screening of draft genome
sequences for tubulin loci in several other species allowed
their character states to be confirmed. The characters identified by the second and third parts are described in Table
1 and were mapped on to an evolutionary tree to infer the
ancestral state prior to the origins of Trypanosoma and
Leishmania, and thereby, determine the phylogeny of
tubulin tandem gene arrays.
Comparison of gene order in T. brucei and L. major genome
sequences
The gene order surrounding the alternating array in T. brucei was conserved on chromosome 20 of L. major. A string
of calpain-like genes, upstream in T. brucei, was contiguous with coatamer β-subunit and RNase-like genes, which
were downstream in T. brucei (see Figure 2(b)). Thus,
while there was a homoeologous position for the alternating array in L. major, there was no trace of tubulin, or the
adjacent histone gene array found in T. brucei.

Figure tandem gene arrays in trypanosomatid genome sequences
Tubulin 1
Tubulin tandem gene arrays in trypanosomatid genome sequences. a) An alternating tandem array of α- and β-tubulin repeats
on chromosome 1 in T. brucei, showing length (in base-pairs) of coding and intergenic sequences. b) Four tubulin loci in L. major
comprising a singleton β-tubulin locus on chromosome 8, a monotypic tandem array of α-tubulin (chromosome 33), a singleton β-tubulin locus on chromosome 21 and a β-tubulin tandem gene array (chromosome 13). Locus names refer to identifier
tags in GeneDB annotations.

There was also colinearity around the location of the L.
major arrays. The α-tubulin array on chromosome 13 was
flanked by an N-acetyl transferase subunit gene and a
long-chain fatty acid CoA ligase gene, as well as other
hypothetical loci. These genes are adjacent on chromosome 11 in T. brucei (see Figure 2(a)), and hypothetical
genes in syntenic positions showed sequence homology.
Likewise for the β-tubulin array; two hypothetical genes
that flank the array in L. major (LmjF33.0790 and
LmjF33.0840) showed high BLAST scores to contiguous
genes on chromsome10 in T. brucei: Tb10.26.0440 (7.9e34) and Tb10.26.0430 (8.4e-141) respectively. The position
of the singleton β-tubulin locus on chromosome 21 in L.
major was partially conserved in T. brucei. The upstream
gene order in L. major was recapitulated in the subtelomeric region of chromosome 10 in T. brucei; however, there
was no tubulin locus and no conserved synteny downstream, suggesting that the tubulin locus corresponds to a
strand break-point (see Figure 2(c)). No homoeologous
position was identified in the T. brucei genome for the
chromosome 8 β-tubulin locus in L. major.
Sequencing of tubulin arrays in further Kinetoplastida
Insect-parasitizing trypansomatids and non-parasitic bodonids were screened for tandem tubulin genes using spe-

cific and degenerate PCR, to provide outgroup
comparisons to character states in Trypanosoma and Leishmania. Products that were amplified and sequenced from
kinetoplastids without genome projects are shown in
Table 1; these were non-coding IGS for the most part,
although fragments of tubulin coding sequence (CDS)
were present at either end to enable positive identification
of gene order. L. mexicana, and C. fasciculata both possessed monotypic arrays and IGS from both α- and βtubulin arrays were at least partially homologous with
those from the existing Leishmania sequences. A monotypic α-tubulin gene array is also documented in Leptomonas seymouri, which is a close relative of Leishmania
[36], (this information is included in Figure 4). There was
no evidence of alternating arrays in any of these species.
Three stercorarian trypanosomes, T. grayi, T. pestanai and
T. cyclops, each possessed alternating arrays, with no evidence for monotypic arrays. While there are some gross
similarities in base composition and polypurine strings,
the IGSs from these species and T. cruzi did not align.
Alternating arrays were also identified in the endosymbiont-bearing Crithidia deanei and another insect-parasitizing trypanosomatid, the aposymbiotic Herpetomonas
megaseliae. Primers designed to amplify monotypic arrays
produced bands for these two species when visualised on

Comparison of gene order around tubulin tandem gene arrays between T.brucei and L. major
Comparison of gene order around tubulin tandem gene arrays between T. brucei and L. major. Chromosomes for each organism
are represented at left (L. major) and right (T. brucei); marked are the locations of tubulin loci (filled boxes), or the conserved
positions of deleted tubulin loci (open boxes). These locations are linked to a panel showing the gene order in T. brucei (shaded
blue) and L. major (shaded green) in each case: (a) α-α array, (b) α-β array, (c) single β-tubulin on chromosome 21 in L. major;
and (d) β-β array. Note that no homeologous location exists in T. brucei for the chromosome 8 single β in L. major. In each
panel putative CDSs are shaded black, hypothetical CDSs in grey. Genes showing reciprocal BLAST scores above 1.0 e-25 are
connected by arrows. Circled letters refer to gene names where available. For hypothetical genes, the identifier tags are given
next to each locus. The supposed positions of deleted tubulin loci, based on conserved synteny, are identified by dashed
arrows. The scale is given in base-pairs and refers to chromosomal position.

electrophoretic gels, but these were weak and inconsistent. Once sequenced, such bands from C. deanei were
shown to result from mis-priming downstream from
tubulin loci.
Table 1 includes many instances where a particular array
could not be found or amplified (denoted by 'x'). This
could reflect a genuine absence, as in the case of completed genome sequences, or it could reflect a failure of
particular reactions, perhaps due to poor primer annealing. For instance, it was not possible to amplify the β-α
IGS for T. pestanai, C. deanei, Neobodo designis or Bodo saltans; these sequences may or may not exist, for instance,
Bodo may have only single β- and α-tubulin genes in tandem, nonetheless, their omission does not prevent the
character states from being identified from the available
evidence.
A variety of degenerate primer combinations generated
products when applied to the non-trypanosomatid kinetoplastids, B. saltans, Parabodo caudatus and N. designis.
When applied at relatively low annealing temperatures
(around 52–58°C), this tended to permit priming at several sites, including on the wrong tubulin. However, this
partial specificity was sufficient to amplify fragments of
tubulin, which were then used to design secondary primers. These successfully generated specific products that
confirmed the presence of alternating arrays in all three
species. When sequenced, those products that had previously indicated monotypic arrays were shown to be IGS
from the same alternating arrays and therefore, the result
of mis-priming. IGSs from the three species could not be
aligned.
The IGSs between tubulin repeats varied greatly in size
and content, over relatively short evolutionary distances.
IGSs within Leishmania aligned but showed substantial
length variation, owing to repetitive DNA motifs. Beyond
this, there was no sequence homology among IGSs of any
array type. There were no obvious sequence motifs shared
by IGSs, although Figure 4 shows that polypyrimidine and
polypurine strings, as well as microsatellites, were very
common.
Arrangement of tubulin genes in Trypanosoma genome sequences
Mining the T. congolense genome sequence produced two
contigs that include alternating arrays of α- and β-tubulin
genes, as in T. brucei; these can be retrieved from geneDB
using
the
identifiers
congo819f03.q1k
and
congo_endsN14h02.p1k respectively. The nucleotide
sequence for the locus directly upstream of the array in T.
brucei (Tb927.1.2320) was used to search T. congolense
unassembled reads. Homologous sequences were identified and tiled together to complete the T. congolense
homolog to the upstream locus; this showed 67% identity

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/261

to the T. brucei gene. Tiling downstream from this gene
showed that the homolog to Tb927.1.2320 is 234 bp
upstream of an α-tubulin and then a further β-tubulin; it
also demonstrated that IGSs following α- and β-tubulin
copies are 353 bp and 443 bp in length respectively and
do not align. Copies of each IGS were identical except for
minor length differences in repetitive regions.
Two contigs confirmed that the situation is very similar in
T. vivax. The first, retrievable from geneDB with the identifier tviv499h03.p1k, comprised an α-tubulin gene and
homologs to loci directly upstream of the array in T. brucei, with conserved synteny. The second, identified by
tviv1885f05.p1k, included six tubulin genes in an alternating array. The IGSs again formed two classes following αand β-tubulin duplicates and were 332–339 bp and 492–
497 bp in length respectively. There was some length variation between repeats due to repetitive elements within
the IGSs.
No array is evident from the current release of the T. cruzi
genome sequence [30]. However, it is known that an alternating α-β array exists [40,41], and sequence data independently deposited in GenBank comprises β- and αtubulin genes in tandem (accessions [GenBank:
AF091836] and [Genbank: M97956], among others).
Otherwise, the genome sequence contained three contigs
that include tubulin. The first (Tc00.1047053506563.40)
showed a single β-tubulin and three other loci; together,
they were colinear with chromosome 1 in T. brucei, and
indicate that this single β-tubulin gene occupies a homoeologous position to the alternating array (shown in Figure
3). Given that an alternating arrangement is known to
exist in T. cruzi, and is not represented elsewhere, this contig is interpreted as the location of the alternating array in
T. cruzi. Since the array may start and end with a β-tubulin
duplicate, the single β-tubulin locus could represent a
'collapsed'
array.
The
second
contig
(Tc00.1047053509003.70) was a duplicate of the first,
although the β-tubulin is annotated as a pseudogene and
apparently lacks 700 bp from the 3' end. The third contig
(Tc00.1047053411235.9) included a lone α-tubulin
without any contextual information. In summary, these
three Trypanosoma genome sequences concurred with the
arrangement in T. brucei, showing an α-β alternating array,
with conservation of surrounding gene order. IGSs following the two isotypes were always dissimilar, but each class
of CDS and internal IGS were consistently concerted.
There was no evidence for further tubulin loci.
Arrangement of tubulin genes in Leishmania genome sequences
The above analysis suggested that the Trypanosoma tubulin
sequences were found only in a single alternating array.
The situation in Leishmania spp. is more complex with
multiple β-tubulin loci. The current release of the L. infan-

Figure 3 of gene order around the tubulin tandem array in T. brucei (shaded blue) and contig 5635 in T. cruzi (shaded red)
Comparison
Comparison of gene order around the tubulin tandem array in T. brucei (shaded blue) and contig 5635 in T. cruzi (shaded red).
Predicted CDS are shown in grey, hypothetical CDS in black. Genes with significant reciprocal BLAST matches are connected
by vertical lines and labelled, showing the relevant e score. The dashed line connects the putative tubulin homologs.

tum genome sequence includes homologs to each L. major
tubulin locus (shown in Figure 1). Searching with BLAST
located two α-tubulin genes in tandem on contig 2963;
comparison of the 958 bp IGS with L. major confirmed
that it shows 95.5% homology to the α-array on chromosome 13. Similarly, tandem β-tubulin genes on contig
4336 had an IGS of 2217 bp, which were 94.2% homologous to those on chromosome 33 in L. major. Contig 4108
included a single β-tubulin and upstream loci that showed
conserved synteny with chromosome 21. The 5' untranscribed region (UTR) of this single β-tubulin gene showed
partial homology with the β-array (as in L. major) but the
3'UTR was unique. Finally, contig 4260 included a single
β-tubulin gene with unique 5' and 3'UTRs that were 96%
identical to those around the chromosome 8 locus in L.
major.
At the time of writing, the draft genome sequence of L.
braziliensis was available as a preliminary, automated
assembly. This included partial α- and β-tubulin genes in

approximately homoeologous positions to those in L.
major. However, these genes did not comprise complete
coding sequences and many of the surrounding loci
present in L. major were not present in the draft assembly.
In fact, the presence of homologs to each L. major locus
was confirmed by manually assembling these loci in L.
braziliensis by tiling reads together, using the last 100 bp of
each read to locate the next. Three distinct 3' UTRs were
identified by searching the read catalogue with the C-terminus of the L. major β-tubulin gene.
Tiling downstream from the first of these distinct
sequences produced the N-terminus of another β-tubulin
gene. This indicated the presence of (at least) a tandem
pair of β-tubulin duplicates. It was not possible to confirm
this by tiling inwards from flanking loci due to sequence
gaps on both sides. The IGS between these duplicates was
1629 bp in length and showed sequence homology with
the L. major β-β tubulin array IGS throughout its length
(although its was substantially shorter due to indels).

The second distinct 3'UTR identified by BLAST also
appeared to tile into another β-tubulin gene but, on closer
inspection, this resulted from a section of repetitive DNA
on either side of the tubulin that caused one to tile back
into the N-terminus. In fact, this UTR corresponded to the
chromosome 8 locus, which was confirmed by searching
the read catalogue for the locus upstream of the chromosome 8 β-tubulin gene in L. major (LmjF08.1280). Tiling
downstream from this identified a putative ortholog to
LmjF08.1280 in L. braziliensis.
The third distinct UTR did not tile into another β-tubulin
gene but a homolog to histone deacetylase gene, which
was downstream of the chromosome 21 β-tubulin in L.
major. After locating a homolog to the upstream locus in
L. major (LmjF21.1855) and tiling downstream, the 5'UTR
of a β-tubulin gene was identified; this confirmed the
presence of an ortholog to the chromosome 21 locus. Tandem α-tubulin genes were identified with BLAST and
shown to occupy a homoeologous position to the array in
L. major, based on conserved synteny of surrounding loci.
In summary, all three Leishmania genome sequences supported the presence of one α-tubulin locus on chromosome 13 and three distinct β-tubulin loci; two singletons
are found on chromosomes 21 and 8, and an arrayed
locus on chromosome 33. In all three species the three βtubulin loci were flanked by distinct untranscribed
regions, except the 5' UTRs of the chromosome 33 and 21
loci, which were partially homologous.
Phylogeny of tubulin genomic architecture
Phylogenetic estimation using 18S rRNA sequences produced a resolved and robust topology, with high bootstrap values at most nodes; the topology is consistent with
previous reconstructions using this marker [38,42-45].
The rRNA phylogeny is shown in Figure 4, the genomic
architecture in each species is shown alongside, as well as
sequence motifs identified in intergenic sequences. The
figure demonstrates that the monotypic arrays in Leishmania spp., C. fasciculata and L. seymouri are the derived condition and have evolved from an ancestor bearing an
alternating array. This derivation occurred once and has
been maintained in all Leishmania species inspected here.
Conversely, all Trypanosoma spp. have maintained an
alternating arrangement. Alternating arrays in all three
non-trypanosomatid clades (Bodo, Parabodo and Neobodo)
suggests that this transition has only occurred once in the
Kinetoplastida.

Discussion
Through a combination of molecular screening of various
kinetoplastid genomes and bioinformatic screening of
trypanosomatid genome sequences, the genomic organisation of tubulin genes in these protists has been identified. The alternating tubulin array in T. brucei and the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/261

distinct, monotypic arrays in L. major are representative of
their respective genera and mutually exclusive, i.e., they
are not modified states of a common ancestral character.
Rather, two results confirm that the monotypic arrays of
Leishmania spp. and their close relatives (Crithidia fasciculata and Leptomonas seymouri) represent a fundamental
rearrangement of tubulin genes, formed de novo in novel
genomic locations. First, the presence of alternating arrays
in all three clades of non-parasitic kinetoplastids indicates
that this was the character state in the ancestral trypanosomatid. Second, gene order comparisons demonstrate
that, while the chromosomal locations of tubulin arrays
are reciprocally conserved, the alternating array has been
entirely abolished in L. major and T. brucei has no
orthologs to the monotypic arrays.
An important feature of this transition is that the alternating locus has been replaced by several novel loci without
any obvious links, other than the tubulin sequence itself,
between the ancestral and derived character states. Comparative genomics is beginning to generate a consensus on
the evolution of genomic structure, with a distinction
drawn between chromosomal rearrangements that cause
disruptions in macrosynteny and may affect karyotype,
and smaller, segmental duplications, inversions and
transpositions, (often accompanied by differential gene
loss), which all disrupt microsynteny [46]. These events
are taxonomically widespread and responsible for the creation of novel genes [47,48]; segmental duplication and
subsequent gene loss largely determines gene order evolution in comparisons of yeast genomes [49] and in primates [50], while gene order in Drosophila spp. is greatly
affected by paracentric inversions [51]. In addition to
these mechanisms, selfish elements have been frequently
implicated in the translocation of genomic DNA, for
example in most plants [52] and in trypanosomes [53].
In this case coding sequences have moved to new locations that otherwise retain colinearity between T. brucei
and L. major. The mechanism of translocation is unclear
since nothing else that may have transposed simultaneously has survived, i.e., no neighbouring genes of the
ancestral locus are seen at the derived loci to provide evidence for their source. The presence of 'calpain-like' proteins upstream of the alternating locus in T. brucei might
suggest that this locus could 'hitch-hike' to new locations
as a result of ectopic recombination between members of
the calpain-like gene family; but the absence of calpainlike proteins adjacent to any derived loci precludes this.
Breakpoints have been identified in otherwise excellent
synteny between trypanosomatid genomes [53]; it
emerged that breakpoints coincide with retrotransposon
hotspots, suggesting that changes to gene order are mediated by selfish elements known from these organisms. A
non-autonomous retroelement (RIME) sequence [54]

Evolution of the genomic architecture of tubulin loci in Kinetoplastida
Evolution of the genomic architecture of tubulin loci in Kinetoplastida. (a) A Maximum likelihood phylogram of relationships
among kinetoplastids, estimated from small subunit ribosomal RNA sequences (maximum of 2065 bp), with a GTR+I+Γ substitution model. Scale bar in substitutions per site. Values at nodes refer to non-parametric bootstrap values, out of 100. Terminal nodes are shaded according to their character state: alternating arrays (black) or monotypic arrays (white). The tree is

does occur at the end of the alternating array in T. brucei,
but this seemed to be associated with the movement of a
contiguous array of histone H3 genes rather than the
tubulin genes, as the RIME and histones were not found
in other species where gene order was otherwise conserved. The two singleton loci in Leishmania did occur at
the extreme 5' end of subtelomeric regions, where retrotransposons are frequently found [52-54], but beyond
this there is no evidence for the role of selfish elements.
The relationships of tubulin loci to strand-switches may
provide evidence of previous chromosomal rearrangements, or place tubulin loci in regions of frequent rearrangement. The α-β array is 40 kb downstream of the
nearest strand-switch. In L. major, the α-α array and chromosome 21 β-tubulin are only 25 Kb from a strandswitch, but for the β-β array and chromosome 8 β-tubulin,
the distances are 75 Kb and 60 Kb respectively [55].
Hence, the significance of chromosomal rearrangements

may yet become clear, but the proximity of strandswitches does not currently look unusual, as they are relatively frequent in these genomes.
Hence, the physical mechanism responsible for new tubulin loci is unclear. Clearly, segmental duplications caused
tubulin genes to be translocated from the ancestral locus
around the genome; this must have created some kind of
transitional structure in which both original and novel
loci coexisted, before the ancestral locus was abolished. A
future study should seek evidence in appropriate non-parasitic relatives of Leishmania, such as Herpetomonas
spp.,Crithidia spp. and Phytomonas spp.; these organisms
are the closest relatives to Leishmania still retaining alternating arrays; they could provide a transitional state
between alternating and monotypic character states, if
they possess other tubulin loci, perhaps additional arrays
or lone genes, and if the gene order around these addi-

tional features could be related to loci in Trypanosoma. In
other words, these organisms may retain elements of the
ancestral, transitional character states in a manner
expressly not seen in Leishmania. Genome structures
diverge faster than genome sequences due to a higher rate
of segmental duplication [46]; this suggests that most
duplications are removed through purifying selection but
also that there are regular opportunities for new loci. The
issue here is, regardless of how tubulin loci were duplicated, why the selective environment changed from purifying to promoting their establishment.
Given the likely difficulties ensuing from a monomer production imbalance in a polymer/dimer polymerisation
equation it is understandable that cells have developed
transcriptional and post-transcriptional controls to regulate equivalent amounts of α and β tubulin [56]. Coupled
with the fact that the trypanosome requires large amounts
of tubulin dimer, the T. brucei arrangement of a large
number of alternating genes provides a very reasonable
solution in an organism lacking transcriptional controls.
Thus, what drivers might cause Leishmania to discard this
structure? The first move appears to have been to separate
the α and β tubulin loci into new sites. If large and essentially equivalent gene numbers are maintained at these
sites and transcriptional passage is similar then this might
appear to offer little disadvantage to the organism. At this
time, we suggest that the alternating isoforms were separated to allow differential expression, and perhaps unilateral changes in regulation, of α- or β-tubulin or both.
Within the context of polycistronic transcription, this
would be the benefit of physical transposition, but the
need that this transition fulfilled is not known.
Certainly, the evolution of differential expression cannot
be related to the evolution of new life stages, since the
major lifecycle difference influencing the cytoskeleton
between T. brucei and L. major is that the latter produces
an amastigote form that lacks a motile flagellum. However, an amastigote is also formed by T. cruzi, which has
conserved the single array; furthermore, it is clear that the
monotypic arrays evolved before the amastigote phase in
Leishmania (as they are present in C. fasciculata and L. seymouri also). Equally, the derivation of monotypic arrays
cannot be related to the evolution of additional, singleton
loci on chromosomes 8 and 21 in Leishmania spp. [57],
since these too evolved in Leishmania, after the monotypic
arrays. Separation of the tubulin isoforms may have facilitated novel β-tubulin loci but it cannot have been derived
from the same fundamental causes.

Conclusion
The restructuring of tubulin repertoire in trypanosomatids
is an example of a very stable system being rapidly and
entirely replaced by a novel derivation. The evolutionary

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/261

causes of the replacement of an alternating α-β tubulin
tandem array by separate, monotypic arrays probably
reflects new expression regimes that became apparent in
the lineage leading to Leishmania, and segmental transpositions that gave the opportunity to craft new loci. The role
of transposition in the evolution of tubulin repertoire
may itself reflect a ubiquitous constraint in kinetoplastids,
and the reason why tubulin tandem arrays exist at all, the
absence of individual gene promoters. The arrangement
of tubulin genes in arrays ensures high expression levels in
the context of polycistronic transcription, but prevents the
divergence of non-coding regions and functional specialisation, probably due to repeated crossing-over between
duplicate alleles and, consequentially, concerted evolution [58]. Setting aside the exact reasons why new tubulin
loci were established, transposition events in the ancestor
of Leishmania may have been essential to overcome the
historical constraint inherited from non-parasitic kinetoplastids, and facilitate the evolution of novel expression
patterns. Furthermore, it was observed here that genomic
environments around tubulin loci, past and present, are
widely conserved across species while tubulin genes themselves are not. This suggests that, once transposed, these
new loci supplanted the original locus, leading to its rapid
eradication.

Methods
This study utilised the completed and draft genome
sequences of various parasitic kinetoplastids: Trypanosoma
brucei, T. cruzi, T. congolense, T. vivax, Leishmania major, L.
infantum and L. braziliensis. These supplemented the
molecular screening of related species that required cell
culture (see references for culture details): T. pestanai, T.
grayi and T. cyclops [45,59],Herpetomonas megaseliae,
Crithidia fasciculata, C. deanei, Bodo saltans (JC02 strain,
[39]), Parabodo caudatus and Neobodo designis (Longstock
strain, [39]). The completed genome sequences of T. brucei and L. major were first compared to establish the relationships (if any) of the genomic locations where tubulin
loci now reside. Various other parasitic trypanosomatids
and free-living bodonids were cultured and screened
using specific and degenerate PCR to establish their character states. Draft genome sequences were interrogated for
tubulin loci and to score each species for its character state
(i.e., alternating or monotypic array).
Comparing genomic location and gene synteny
The genomic location of the T. brucei array is specified by
gene order. This site was identified in L. major to establish
if the location was conserved through time or, alternatively, if tubulin rearrangements had evolved in new chromosomal environments. DNA sequences of up- and
downstream coding loci were used as queries for BLAST
searches of the L. major genome in GeneDB. Similarly, the
genomic locations of all four L. major tubulin genes were

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:261

located in the T. brucei genome. Comparisons were also
made between T. brucei and T. cruzi to establish if both
species share a homologous alternating array, on the basis
of chromosomal location. T. brucei sequences for flanking
loci were used to search among the partially assembled T.
cruzi contigs and locate their closest homologs as before.
Character scoring from genomic DNA
Where sequence data was gathered de novo, this required
cell culture, genomic DNA extraction, amplification by
PCR, molecular cloning and sequencing. Cell culture was
carried out at room temperature for free-living species (B.
saltans, P. caudatus and N. designis) in soil-extract solution,
enriched with 0.25% beef extract. Parasitic species were
cultured in standard media at 37°C: Warren medium
([60], for C. deanei and C. fasciculata), SDM-79 ([61], for
T. cyclops, T. grayi and T. pestanai) and liver infusion tryptose ([62], for H. megaseliae). Genomic DNA was prepared
from 50–100 ml of liquid culture (cell density: 1 × 106–
107 ml-1) by phenol-chloroform extraction and resuspension in 10 mM Tris [63].

Both specific and degenerate primers were designed to
anchor within the termini of tubulin CDSs at conserved
points identified from alignments of kinetoplastid α- and
β-tubulin genes, which included a natural outgroup
Euglena gracilis [64], ([GenBank: AF182555, GenBank:
AF182557]). Therefore, these primers could amplify
across the IGS of any potential array. Specific primers were
labelled: 'sensealpha' (GAGAAGGACTACGAGGAGGT);
'antialpha' (GAGTACCAGCAGTACCAG); 'sensebeta'
(CA(TC)TGGTACGTCGGATGAGGG) and 'antibeta'
(GGTGG(CT)ACTGGTCT(CT)). Degenerate primers were
labelled:
'alphaF'
(TCGA(CT)(CT)T(GCT)ATGTAC(AC)(GC)CAAGCG);
'alphaR'
(TCCTTGCC(AG)(GC)(AT)(GC)A(CT)CAGCTGC);
'betaF'
(AC(GCT)G(GCT)(GCT)ATGTTCCG(CT)CGCAAG) and
'betaR'
(CCAG(AT)CTG(AGT)CCAAA(GT)A(CT)(AG)AAGTTG).
In combination, these primer pairs could amplify across
the IGS of α-α, β-β, β-α and α-β tandem gene pairs in any
of the cultured species. All combinations of specific and
degenerate primers respectively were applied to each DNA
preparation. 'Touchdown' PCR was performed under the
following conditions: denaturation at 95°C, extension at
70°C and annealing at 58°C for 5 cycles, 56°C for 5 cycles
and 52°C for 25 cycles (for specific primary primers) or
68°C for 5 cycles, 64°C for 5 cycles and 60°C for 25 cycles
(for degenerate primary primers). Products were cloned
into pGEM T-easy plasmid vectors (Promega), purified
from bacterial culture and sequenced using an ABI 377
automated sequencer.

Character scoring from genome sequences: contig
assembly and inspection
Tubulin genes were identified for Trypanosoma congolense
and T. vivax by BLAST searching [65] within their draft
genome sequences, available from the GeneDB website
(Sanger Institute Pathogen Sequencing Unit [66]). T. brucei α- and β-tubulin DNA sequences were used as the
search query. Positive contigs were then inspected using
Artemis v5.0 [67] to establish if arrayed tubulin genes
could be found on a single contig. At this time, the Leishmania infantum and L. braziliensis genomes were available
as first draft assemblies, without any manual annotation
or checking of assembly. Prior to manual revision, a preliminary assembly can make errors, especially regarding
duplicate gene loci. For this reason, it was necessary for
these species to identify matches to tubulin by BLAST
searching among read catalogues, then use these matches
to search for overlapping reads and finally to assemble
contigs by tiling together individual reads. L. major α- and
β-tubulin DNA sequences were used as the search query.
Estimating species phylogenies
A comparative approach to the evolution of genomic
characters requires a species phylogeny. This was obtained
through phylogenetic analysis of small subunit ribosomal
RNA sequences for the species concerned. These were
selected from depositions to GenBank: T. cruzi [GenBank:
AF232214], T. pestanai [GenBank: AJ009159], T. congolense [GenBank: AJ223563], T. brucei [GenBank:
AJ009142], T. grayi [GenBank: AJ005278], T. cyclops [GenBank: AJ131958], T. vivax [GenBank: U22316], L. major
[GenBank: X53915], L. mexicana [GenBank: X53912], H.
megaseliae [GenBank: U01014], C. fasciculata [GenBank:
Y00055], L. infantum [GenBank: X07773], L. braziliensis
[GenBank: M80292], C. oncopelti [GenBank: AF038025],
B. saltans [GenBank: AF208889], N. designis [GenBank:
AY998646], P. caudatus [GenBank: AY490218] and L. seymouri [GenBank: AF153040]. Note that C. oncopelti, a
close relative of C. deanei, was used as a surrogate in the
rRNA alignment, given the absence of any SSU rRNA
sequence for C. deanei. Sequences were aligned by eye and
maximum likelihood phylogenetic estimation was carried
out using PHYML [68,69]. A general-time reversible (GTR,
[70]) model was applied, with six rate categories estimated from the data. An initial tree topology was selected
through neighbour-joining. Corrections were made for
both invariant sites and rate heterogeneity by estimating
the proportion of invariant sites and the gamma distribution parameter (α) from the data. 100 non-parametric
bootstrapped data sets were estimated.
