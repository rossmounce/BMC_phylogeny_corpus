Abstract
Background: Cyanobacteria produce a wealth of secondary metabolites, including the group of
small cyclic heptapeptide hepatotoxins that constitutes the microcystin family. The enzyme
complex that directs the biosynthesis of microcystin is encoded in a single large gene cluster (mcy).
mcy genes have a widespread distribution among cyanobacteria and are likely to have an ancient
origin. The notable diversity within some of the Mcy modules is generated through various
recombination events including horizontal gene transfer.
Results: A comparative analysis of the adenylation domains from the first module of McyB (McyB1)
and McyC in the microcystin synthetase complex was performed on a large number of microcystinproducing strains from the Anabaena, Microcystis and Planktothrix genera. We found no decisive
evidence for recombination between strains from different genera. However, we detected frequent
recombination events in the mcyB and mcyC genes between strains within the same genus. Frequent
interdomain recombination events were also observed between mcyB and mcyC sequences in
Anabaena and Microcystis. Recombination and mutation rate ratios suggest that the diversification
of mcyB and mcyC genes is driven by recombination events as well as point mutations in all three
genera. Sequence analysis suggests that generally the adenylation domains of the first domain of
McyB and McyC are under purifying selection. However, we found clear evidence for positive
selection acting on a number of amino acid residues within these adenylation domains. These
include residues important for active site selectivity of the adenylation domain, strongly suggesting
selection for novel microcystin variants.
Conclusion: We provide the first clear evidence for positive selection acting on amino acid
residues involved directly in the recognition and activation of amino acids incorporated into
microcystin, indicating that the microcystin complement of a given strain may influence the ability
of a particular strain to interact with its environment.

Background
Cyanobacteria produce a wealth of bioactive peptide
derivatives with a broad range of biological activities and
pharmacological properties [1]. Many of these are synthesized on nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS).
These megaenzyme complexes typically have a modular
architecture. A typical module contains specific functional
domains for activation, thioesterification, and condensation of amino acids [2]. Additional domains for the modification of activated amino acids such as epimerization,
heterocyclisation, oxidation, formylation, reduction or Nmethylation may also be present [2]. NRPS gene clusters
in some cyanobacteria can occupy up to 5 percent of the
genome [1].
The modular design of NRPS gene clusters promotes
homologous recombination, including recombination
within a gene cluster and intragenomic recombination
between different gene clusters within the same genome
or intergenomic recombination with DNA introduced
from other cyanobacteria [3-5]. The cellular consequences
of recombination will depend on several factors, including the phenotypic effects, if any, of the introduced DNA
segment. In order to be successful, the new gene variant
should at least not be detrimental to the host. For NRPS
systems, important factors will be whether the novel peptide can fulfil the biological role(s) of the original peptide
or provide new benefits to the host. Nonetheless, recombination within and among NRPS gene clusters potentially could constitute a mechanism for continuous
alteration of the synthetases and peptide products.
Among cyanobacterial NRPSs, the microcystin synthetase
gene clusters (mcy) have been extensively studied. Microcystins are cyclic heptapeptides with common structure
cyclo-D-Ala1-X2-D-MeAsp3-Z4-Adda5-D-Glu6-Mdha7
where D-MeAsp is D-erythro-β-methyl-aspartic acid, Adda
is 3-amino-9-methoxy-2,6,8-trimethyl-10-phenyl-(4E),
(6E)-decadienoic acid, D-Glu is D-iso-glutamic acid, and X
and Z are variable L-amino acids (Figure 1). Complete
gene cluster sequences are available from strains within
the Anabaena, Microcystis and Planktothrix genera [6-10].
Recombination in the mcy gene clusters has been reported
to involve equivalent modules, i.e. modules with the
same position in similar gene clusters [11-13], but also
modules in different positions in similar gene clusters or
from different gene clusters [3,14,15]. Although most
strains can produce a range of microcystin isoforms there
is a single mcy gene cluster in the genome [6-8,10,16,17],
indicating that recombination events involving equivalent domains must be intergenomic.
The substrate specificity of the adenylation (A) domain is
considered to be the primary determinant of substrate
selection (for a review, see [18]). Recombination events

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/256

involving A domains might lead to changes in substrate
specificity and subsequently in the microcystin profile
[3,15]. The A domains of modules McyB1 (the first module of the McyB protein) and McyC recognise and activate
the amino acids that are incorporated in the variable positions X and Z of microcystin (Figure 1). These A domains
have been extensively studied within Microcystis [13,15],
and Planktothrix [11,14]. Within Microcystis, recombination has lead to the presence of two types of A domains in
different strains [15]: a mainly Leu-activating A domain
and a mainly Arg-activating A domain that has a high
sequence similarity to the Arg-activating A domain in
McyC (in the following, these two types of A domains in
McyB1 are called B-type and C-like, respectively). Recombination involving A domain coding regions of mcyB1
and mcyC has been detected in Microcystis [13,15] and
Anabaena [3,9].
Here, we compare McyB1 and McyC A domains in strains
from the three main microcystin-producing genera: Anabaena, Microcystis and Planktothrix to investigate the role of
genomic processes in the reshaping of microcystin genes,
enzyme complexes and corresponding peptides. We have
looked for signs of recombination, both between equivalent and non-equivalent modules, as well as mutations
and selective forces acting on these A domains.

Results
In the present study, we have compared A domains of
microcystin synthetase modules McyB1 and McyC from
altogether 58 strains including 21 Anabaena, 19 Microcystis
and 18 Planktothrix strains with characterized microcystinisoform profiles, including two non-producers (Table 1).
The profiles made it possible to identify the amino acid
residue(s) incorporated by each of these modules.
Microcystin isoforms produced by different genera
In total, we identified 22 structural variants (Table 1),
mainly differing in the methylation status of D-Asp3 or
Dha7, but also the amino acid present at position X (Figure 1). Seven different amino acid residues were found at
position X, mainly Leu, Arg and homotyrosine (Hty), but
also Phe, homoisoleucine (Hil), homophenylalanine
(Hph) and Tyr, while only Arg was found at position Z
(Table 1).

The Anabaena strains mainly produce MC-LR variants, but
also several other isoforms, e.g. MC-RR and MC-HtyR
(Table 1). Nine Microcystis strains produce MC-RR, either
as the only isoform or together with MC-LR and/or MCYR. One strain produces only MC-YR isoforms, while
seven strains produce MC-LR isoforms (together with MCYR for two strains) (Table 1). Two of the Microcystis strains
examined here have a partial deletion of the mcy gene
cluster and do not produce microcystin [13]. Within
Planktothrix, 15 of 18 strains produce MC-RR, either as the
only isoform (5 strains), together with MC-LR (8 strains)
or together with MC-LR and MC-HtyR (2 strains). The
remaining three strains produce mainly MC-HtyR, one of
them together with MC-LR (Table 1).
Adenylation domain-encoding sequences of mcyB1 and
mcyC
Analysis of the McyB1 sequences from Anabaena and
Planktothrix revealed the presence of a single type of A
domain with a high degree of sequence similarity to the A
domain of McyC. Among Microcystis, 7 strains were found
to possess a B-type (activating mainly Leu) and 12 strains
a C-like (activating mainly Arg – like the McyC) A domain
in McyB1 (Table 1, indicated by B and C, respectively).
Phylogenetic analyses of cyanobacterial A domains have
shown that the McyB1 sequence from Microcystis strain
PCC 7806 (which is of B-type) does not cluster with McyC
A domain sequences as do McyB1 sequences from Anabaena and Planktothrix, but clusters with other Leu activating A domains [3,19]. Phylogenetic analysis of 115 McyB1
and McyC A domain sequences aligned with the remaining Mcy adenylation domains from Microcystis, Anabaena
and Planktothrix (acc. nos. AF183408, AJ536156 and
AJ441056, respectively) showed also that McyB1 B-type A
domains of Microcystis form a clade separate from other
McyB1 and McyC sequences (Additional file 1, Figure S1).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/256

Therefore, in the comparisons below of McyB1 sequences
from all three genera, only the C-like McyB1 sequences of
Microcystis were included.
The variation measured as percentage divergence and
nucleotide diversity (π) within the mcyB1 sequences was
similar in Anabaena (0–6%, π = 0.032) and Microcystis (0–
6.3%, π = 0.033) and slightly lower (0–3.6%, π = 0.023)
in the Planktothrix data set. The sequence variation within
mcyC was low in Anabaena (0–2.4%, π = 0.009) and Planktothrix (0–1.2%, π = 0.003) and similar to that of mcyB1 in
the Microcystis data set (0–7.1%, π = 0.035) (Table 2).
When C-like A domain encoding sequences in mcyB1 were
compared with the mcyC sequence from the same strain,
genus-specific differences in the genetic variation were
observed: 0.7–7.2% (π = 0.037) in Anabaena strains, 8.6–
12.4% (π = 0.035) in Microcystis strains and 29.8–30.8%
(π = 0.158) in Planktothrix strains (Table 2). Interestingly,
the sequences from the non-producing Microcystis strains
did not diverged from the rest, suggesting insufficient time
for any divergence or that the selective constraints still are
the same.
Variation in evolutionary rates between genera and
between McyB1 and McyC
Phylogenetic analyses of the amino acid sequence alignment of the 108 McyB1 and McyC A domain sequences
yielded a similar tree topology for all methods used (ML,
Bayesian and NJ, Figure 2). Five well-supported main
clades were observed: McyB1/McyC of Anabaena, McyB1
of Microcystis, McyC of Microcystis, McyB1 of Planktothrix
and McyC of Planktothrix. All clades were genus-specific.
The McyB1 and McyC sequences from Microcystis formed
two separate clades, as did the McyB1 and McyC
sequences from Planktothrix, but the A domains of Planktothrix were separated on longer branches. Interestingly,
within the Anabaena clade, no distinct, well-supported
McyC clade was inferred. Almost all Anabaena McyB1
sequences formed a clade with moderate support (PP
0.98, BS-ML 69%, BS-NJ 83%), except for the sequences
from strains 288, N-C 267/4 and 18B6. The McyB1
sequence from strain 18B6 clustered with the McyC
sequence from the same strain with moderate support (PP
0.93, BS-ML 65%, BS-NJ 84%).
Mutation rates and recombination within- and between
McyB1 and McyC adenylation domains
The mutation rates ranged from 0.0076 to 0.0359, being
lowest in mcyC of Anabaena and Planktothrix (Table 3).
Moderate recombination levels (0.010 ≤ ρ ≤ 0.027 per
base) (Table 3) were detected in all data sets except for
mcyC from Planktothrix. Low recombination levels were
estimated for this data set, but all three permutation tests
indicated that recombination rate was not statistically significant different from 0. Recombination rate/mutation

‡ Recombination detection between genera

rate ratios below 1 in the Microcystis and Planktothrix data
sets (Table 3) suggest that point mutations are the main
cause of genetic variation in McyB1 and McyC A domains
from these genera. In contrast, a recombination rate/
mutation rate ratio higher than 1 in the Anabaena data sets
indicates that recombination has had a major impact on
these A domains.
Recombination events were also suggested in all data sets
by the mosaic structure of informative sites, with the
exception of mcyC from Planktothrix (Figure 3). The reticulate phylogenies revealed by the split decomposition
analysis (Figures 4 and 5) were supported by Phi test
(Table 2) in all data sets except mcyC from Planktothrix.
Recombination detection programs (RDP, GENECONV
and MaxChi) identified several recombination breakpoints along the entire mcyB1 sequences in Anabaena and
Planktothrix strains, while only one single putative recombination event was detected within the Microcystis mcyB1
and mcyC data sets (Table 4). No recombination events
were suggested by recombination detection programs

within the mcyC alignments of Anabaena and Planktothrix.
The analyses of the combined mcyB1C data sets (Figure 6,
Table 5) suggested recombination events between mcyB1
and mcyC in Anabaena and Microcystis, but not in Planktothrix.
Substrate specificity of MycB1 and McyC adenylation
domains
McyB1 and McyC A domain sequences were aligned with
the Phe-activating A domain of GrsA [20] to identify the
binding-pocket residues. The binding pocket signatures of
McyC A domains (activating mainly Arg) were more or
less identical within the genus, while only five residues are
identical in binding pocket signatures from all three genera (Table 6). Binding pocket signatures are more diverse
in McyB1 A domains, reflecting the diversity of amino
acid residues incorporated in position X (Table 6). Some
McyB1 modules with identical binding pocket signatures
incorporate a somewhat different set of amino acid residues (e.g. Microcystis strains N-C 357 and N-C 496, Table
6), indicating that other residues in the A domain or other

domains, such as the condensation domain influence
substrate specificity. A role of the condensation domain in
substrate selection has been suggested by several studies
(for a review, see [18]).
Adenylation domains and selective forces
An excess of synonymous over non-synonymous substitutions (ω < 1) (Table 7) was observed in all data sets, indicating that the A domains of McyB1 and McyC overall are
under purifying selection in all three genera. Small fractions (0.3–10.4%) of codons under positive selection
were detected in all data sets except for McyC from Planktothrix (Table 7). The number of potential sites under positive selection with statistical support (P > 90%) ranged
from 3 to 8 (Table 7) and their positions in the A domain
alignment are shown in Figure 7. Interestingly, in both
Anabaena data sets as well as in the Planktothrix McyB1
data set, the binding pocket residue 278 (Figure 7, Table
7) appears to be under positive selection. In the Microcystis
McyC data set, this is also the case for the amino acid residue between binding pocket residues 299 and 301 (Figure 7). Among residues not present in binding pocket
signatures, site 205 in the McyC alignments in both Microcystis and Anabaena and site 350 in both Microcystis data
sets (Figure 7) were suggested to be under positive selection.

Branch-site models were used to detect possible positive
selection acting on the McyB1 sequences from Anabaena
and Planktothrix strains that incorporate Hty in position X.
(Table 1, Figure 2). There were no statistically significant
differences between the log-likelihood values of the alternative models and the null models (data not shown),
indicating no evidence for positive selection in domains
incorporating Hty.

Discussion
This study is so far the most extensive comparative analysis of microcystin synthetase adenylation domains for the

modules McyB1 and McyC. The phylogenetic trees of the
108 adenylation domain sequences showed clustering
according to module and genus (Figure 2). Our data set
revealed no signs of recombination between genera, in
agreement with previous studies on mcy genes [3,21] and
similar studies from other NRPS gene clusters [19,22].
This also is in line with other studies that show that the
rate of successful homologous recombination rapidly is
reduced with increased genetic distance [23-25].
The evolutionary history of the McyB1 A domain
It is not clear at present which of the two types of A
domains in McyB1, was present in the ancestral microcystin synthetase. A B-type ancestral A domain implies that
after segregation of the genera, some Microcystis strains
and all Anabaena and Planktothrix acquired a C-like type of
A domain in McyB1, most likely through intragenomic
recombination between mcyB1 and mcyC, as suggested for
Hapalosiphon hibernicus and Anabaena strain 18B6 [3]. If
the ancestral McyB1 A domain was C-like, some Microcystis strains must have obtained a novel McyB1 A
domain, presumably through recombination with a different NRPS gene cluster. Recently, the presence of a Leuactivating, B-type McyB1 A domain was reported in two
Nostoc strains [3] and this may in contrast strengthen the
hypothesis that the ancestral A domain in McyB1 was Btype. However, the B-type A domain sequences from
Microcystis and Nostoc seem to be separated by rather long
phylogenetic distances, suggesting that these A domains
were introduced in the McyB1 module by two independent recombination events [3]. Clearly, further studies are
needed to clarify the evolutionary history of the McyB1 A
domain.
Genomic processes reshaping the adenylation domains of
McyB1 and McyC
Our results suggest that recombinations as well as point
mutations contribute to variation in the A domains of
modules McyB1 and McyC. Within Anabaena and Microcystis, frequent recombination was suggested both within
and between mcyB1 and mcyC sequences (Figures 3, 4 and
5, Tables 4 and 5). The low sequence variation (0–1.2%)
within Planktothrix mcyC sequences makes it difficult to
detect recombination, since for the majority of methods,
a minimum sequence variation of 5% is necessary to
obtain substantial power [26]. The large sequence divergence between Planktothrix mcyB1 and mcyC sequences
might prevent homology-driven recombination, which
requires a relatively high level of sequence similarity
between the donor and recipient DNA. In Planktothrix, the
longest identical DNA segment shared by mcyB1 and mcyC
(18 bp) may be too short for initiation of RecA-mediated
recombination [27-29]. Within Anabaena and Microcystis,
the high sequence similarity between these gene segments
appears to be maintained by frequent recombination

events. Recombination between different domains, such
as mcyB1 and mcyC, has in some cases lead to replacement
of a nearly entire A domain (in Anabaena 18B6) and in
others to replacement of a functionally important part of
the domain in McyB1 (in Microcystis N-C 264) (Figure 3).
In both cases this has resulted in a change of functionality
(i.e. amino acid activated) and subsequent production of
microcystin-RR.

Our results, together with previous reports [3,11,15], indicate that various types of recombination lead to a continual restyling (remodelling) of the adenylation domains of
microcystin synthetase. Recombination within a single
domain appears to be frequent and may have little impact
on the type of amino acid activated. Recombination
between mcyB1 and mcyC appears to be frequent in some
genera and may result in changes in the microcystin pro-

for other segments of the mcy gene cluster [11,12,21],
indicating that mutations that affect the amino acid
sequence of these domains generally are deleterious.
However, the ω-values (0.2–0.49) observed in this study
are relatively high compared to ω-values reported for several cyanobacterial house keeping genes (mainly below
0.1) [30], implying a relaxation of selective constraints.
Amino acid residues in the A domains of McyB1 and
McyC that seem to be under positive selective pressure are
located throughout the entire analyzed sequence (Figure
7). Among the positively selected amino acids, residues
included in binding pocket signatures are particularly
interesting, since they may influence the active site selectivity [31,32]. The amino acid change Phe→Cys in binding pocket position 278 (Table 6) in the McyB1 sequences
of Anabaena is an example of this. According to the peptide profiles of the Anabaena strains (Table 1), this change
is associated with the incorporation of Hty/Leu, rather
than only Leu (or Leu/Arg). Also, the Leu→Phe exchange
at the binding pocket position 278 in the McyB1
sequences of Planktothrix (Table 6) is associated with a
change in incorporation from Hty to Arg. One could

hypothesize that positive selection of these and other residues in the synthetases reflect selection of a particular
peptide profile produced by the corresponding strains.
Such a causative relationship between these specific
genetic changes and phenotypic effects remains to be
demonstrated.
Interestingly, a binding pocket residue under positive
selection is also present in the McyC sequences of Anabaena (Figure 7). Since all McyC modules studied here
mainly incorporate Arg, the selection seemingly does not
concern gross substrate specificity. Other properties, like
NRPS catalytic efficiency or the ability to produce minor
variants, might be the properties selected for. Also in
McyB1 sequences from all genera there are several positively selected amino acid residues not associated with
substrate selectivity, indicating that some other property is
selected for in these A domains. This could for instance
again be changes in the catalytic efficiency or in the interactions between neighboring domains and modules.
Sequence comparisons show that the A domain of McyC
is more conserved than the McyB1 A domain – also

reflected by the lack of amino acid variation in position Z
of the produced peptides. Within Planktothrix, a lower
recombination rate and stronger purifying selection compared to Anabaena and Microcystis indicate stronger functional constraints.

Conclusion

Microcystis (B) and Planktothrix (C). Bootstrap values over

Our results revealed no clear indications of recombination across the genera, while frequent recombination
events both within and between mcyB and mcyC
sequences were detected between strains from same
genus, except for mcyC from Planktothrix. We demonstrate
remodelling of mcyB and mcyC genes including evidence
for positive selection acting at some sites, indicating that
the microcystin variant profile of a given strain is likely to
influence the ability of the strain to interact with its environment.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:256

Methods
Bacterial strains
Cyanobacterial strains were grown at the University of
Helsinki and Norwegian Institute of Water Research
(NIVA) under continuous white light at a photon irradiance of 7 μmol m-2 s-1 in Z8 medium [33].
Mass spectrometry
Microcystins were extracted from lyophilized biomass collected on glass fiber filters with 50% MeOH as extraction
agent. A detailed description of the method can be found
in Rohrlack et al. [34].

For the identification of microcystins liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS/MS) was
used. The instrumental setup included a Waters Acquity
UPLC System equipped with a Waters Atlantis C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm, 5 μm particle size) and directly coupled to a Waters Quattro Premier XE tandem quadrupole
MS/MS detector. The UPLC system was set to deliver a linear gradient from 20% to 60% acetonitrile in water, both
containing 0.1% acetic acid, within 8 minutes at a flow
rate of 0.25 mL min-1. The column and auto sampler temperatures were 20 and 4°C, respectively. At all times, the
MS/MS detector was run in positive electrospray mode
(ESI+). Other general settings included a source temperature of 120°C, a desolvation temperature of 350°C, a drying gas flow rate of 800 L hour-1, a gas flow at the cone of
50 L hour-1, and standard voltages and energies suggested
by the manufacturer for the ESI+ mode.
To screen extracts for microcystins, the detector was run in
total scanning mode for the mass range from 500 to 1100
Da over the entire UPLC gradient. At this stage, the cone
voltage was 60 V and the time for one scan 2 seconds.
Afterwards, all mass signals, that represented compounds
with a molecular mass within the range of 500–1100 Da,
were analyzed in fragmentation experiments. To this end,
the detector was run in daughter ion scanning mode and
the cone voltage and collision cell settings were optimized
to obtain as many fragments of the respective compound
as possible. In all cases, argon served as collision gas.
Microcystins were identified by their typical fragmentation patterns including a number of immonium ions of
amino acids, the characteristic Adda side chain fragment
(135 Da), and a number of ring fragments. Identification
was further supported by comparing fragmentation patterns with those of Microcystin LR, RR and YR standards
that have been purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and by
using the fragmentation simulation software HighChemMass Frontier (version 3). The precise positions of
demethylations in microcystin molecules were not determined.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/256

DNA extraction, PCR amplification and sequencing
For microcystin-producing Anabaena strains supplied by
the University of Helsinki strain collection, DNA was
extracted from dried cell matter with Qiagen DNeasy
Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany).
Strains from NIVA were lysed according to Chromczynski
and Rymaszewski [35] and PCR performed directly on the
lysate.

PCR was performed with DynaZyme II DNA polymerase
(Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) and BD Advantage™ 2
polymerase (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Primers
used for amplification of adenylation domains from the
mcyABC operon are listed in Table 8 and their relative
positions in the mcyABC operon are shown in Figure 1.
Genus-specific primers for Microcystis and Anabaena were
designed based on the publicly available mcy gene
sequences of Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 (AF183408)
and UV027 (AF458094) and Anabaena strain 90
(AJ536156). Primers used for amplifying the mcyB segment from Microcystis strains were placed as far as possible
apart from the region involved in the recombination
event between the A domain-encoding segments of mcyB
and mcyC [13,15]. The mcyB regions flanking the recombination site are highly similar in all Microcystis strains
(Additional file 1, Figure S1). The PCR products were purified using E.Z.N.A Gel Extraction Kit (Omega Biotek) and
Montage™ PCR Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The purified PCR products were
sequenced with both external and internal primers (Table
8). Sequencing was conducted under BigDye™ terminator
cycling conditions, and sequencing reactions were purified using ethanol precipitation and separated on an
Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer. Chromatograms were examined with the program CHROMAS 2.2
(Technelysium Pty Ltd.), while editing and contig assembly were performed with BIOEDIT sequence alignment editor. All sequences have been submitted to GenBank under
accession numbers EU009866–EU009922 (Table 1). Several sequences (for Microcystis strains PCC 7806, K-139,
UV027, NIES102 and Anabaena strain 90) were retrived
from GenBank together with A domain sequences from
Planktothrix spp. generated by Kurmayer and co-workers
[11,14] (Table 1).
Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses
Amino acid sequences of A domains from all genera were
aligned using ClustalW [36]. The best evolution model
based on the sequence alignment was determined using
ProtTest [37]. The sequences were used to infer the phylogeny in a Bayesian framework applying the program
MrBayes v3.1 [38]. Analysis with the following parameters
was performed: JTT model, gamma distribution, running
2 million generations and sampling trees every 100 generation, burn-in 3000 trees. The maximum likelihood (ML)

by ProtTest. The Neighbor joining (NJ) tree was obtained
under the JTT model and gamma distribution using MEGA
version 3 [40]. Bootstrap confidence limits were obtained
by 1000 replicates in both ML and NJ analysis. DnaSP version 3.51 [41] was used to estimate mutation rates, based
on the number of segregating sites, using the Watterson's
estimator of Θ [42] and the average nucleotide diversity
(π) [43].
Recombination analyses and nucleotide substitution
statistics
Recombination was investigated by split decomposition
analysis using SplitsTree version 4.8 [44] with default settings (uncorrected P method) and 1000 bootstrap replicates together with Phi test for recombination [45]. In
addition, the following statistical tests for detecting

recombination were used: GENECONV [46], RDP, and
MaxChi [47] analyses in the RDP version 2 b08 program
package [48]. For detecting recent and older recombination events using GENECONV G-scale values 0 and 1 were
used, respectively. Recombination was also detected by
visual analysis of informative sites (variable sites where
each variant occurs in at least two sequences) as described
by Rudi et al. [24].
The recombination rate, ρ = 2 Nr (N is the effective population size and r is the recombination rate per nucleotide
site per generation) was estimated for each data set using
the composite likelihood method proposed by Hudson
[49] and extended to allow for finite-site mutation models
[50]. The method is based on combining the coalescent
likelihoods of all pairwise comparisons of segregating
sites. The hypothesis of no recombination was tested
using the likelihood permutation test (LPT) as in McVean

Primers Microcystis-mcyC-F and Microcystis-mcyC-R were used in [13]

et al. [50] and the permutation tests which detect a
decrease in r2 and |D'|, measures of linkage disequilibrium, with an increase in the physical distance. Both the
composite likelihood analysis and the three permutation
tests were carried out using the LDhat package [50].
We used CODEML from the PAML v3.15 package [51] to
test for the presence of codon sites affected by positive
selection and to identify those sites under selection. A
likelihood ratio test (LRT) for positive selection [52,53]
compares two codon substitution models, one of which
accounts for positive selection and the other which does
not. The gene is inferred to be under positive selection if
(1) ML estimates suggests that there are codon(s) under
positive selection (with ω = dn/ds > 1) and (2) the LRT is
significant. Simulations by Anisimova et al. [54] showed
that high levels of recombination seem to affect dramatically the accuracy of the LRT test and that recombination
often mistakenly is seen as evidence of positive selection.
LRTs of M0–M3 and M1–M2 are heavily affected, while
LRT of M7–M8 is much less (positive selection was falsely
detected in only 20% of replicates). Therefore, models M7
(beta) and M8 (beta and ω) were considered in present
study. Under the model M7 (beta), the ω ratio various
according to the beta distribution and does not allow the
positive selected sites (< ω < 1), and thus serves as the null
model by comparing with model M8 (beta and ω). Model
M8 adds an additional site class to the beta model to
account for sites under positive selection (ω > 1). A Bayesian approach implemented in CODEML and shown to
be robust to recombination effects [54] was used to identify residues under positive selection. The average ω for A
domain sequences was calculated using the parameters of
the best fitting model.

Branch-site models [55] were employed to test for positive
selection acting on specific branches in the phylogenetic
tree. Branches of the tree were divided a priori into foreground and background lineages, and a LRT was constructed by comparing a model that allows positive
selection on the foreground lineages (alternative model)
with a model that does not allow such positive selection
(the null model).
