Abstract
Simian virus 40 (SV40) is a monkey virus that was administered to human populations by
contaminated vaccines which were produced in SV40 naturally infected monkey cells.
Recent molecular biology and epidemiological studies suggest that SV40 may be contagiously
transmitted in humans by horizontal infection, independently from the earlier administration of
SV40-contaminated vaccines.
SV40 footprints in humans have been found associated at high prevalence with specific tumor types
such as brain and bone tumors, mesotheliomas and lymphomas and with kidney diseases, and at
lower prevalence in blood samples from healthy donors.
Contrasting reports appeared in the literature on the circulation of SV40 in humans by contagious
transmission and its association, as a possible etiologic cofactor, with specific human tumors. As a
consequence of the conflicting results, a considerable debate has developed in the scientific
community. In the present review we consider the main results obtained by different groups
investigating SV40 sequences in human tumors and in blood specimens, the putative role of SV40
in the onset/progression of specific human tumors, and comment on the hypotheses arising from
these data.

Background
Simian virus 40 (SV40) is a monkey virus which was accidentally administered to humans, in the years 1955-'63,
through contaminated poliovirus vaccines. The subsequent findings of the transforming and oncogenity activities of the SV40 viral large T (Tag) and small t (tag)
antigens, have prompted investigations into the potential
of SV40 to induce cancer in humans. To date, hundreds of
molecular and epidemiologic studies aimed at investigating whether SV40 infects humans, its potential mode of

transmission and its putative role in human tumors, have
been published.
In this review we evaluate the biological, pathological and
clinical evidence of SV40 in human cancers, non-malignant diseases and blood samples.

names of the three representative viruses Papilloma, Polyoma, and Vacuolating agent. More recently, SV40 has
been considered a Polyomavirus, together with the
human BK (BKV) and JC (JCV) Polyomaviruses. The virion is about 45 nm, an icosahedral particle, with a density
of 1.34–1.35 g/cm3. The viral genome is a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule. SV40 codes, at least, for six
viral proteins: two early nonstructural polypeptides, the
large tumor antigen (Tag) and the small tumor antigen
(tag), an agnoprotein, probably involved in the assembly
of viral particles and processing of late mRNA and three
capsid proteins, VP1, VP2, and VP3 [1-3]. The early and
late genes are transcribed on different DNA strands in a
way that the transcription proceeds divergently from the
regulatory region. This region contains the origin of DNA
replication and binding sites for the transcription factors
that control viral gene expression, and terminates within
DNA sequences containing the polyadenylation signals.
Recently, a predicted late polarity pre-microRNA (premiRNA) to the untranslated region 3' of the polyadenylation cleavage site in the late pre-mRNA has also been
detected [4,5].
SV40 is phylogenetically closely related to the human JCV
and BKV. They evidence similarity with respect to size
(~5.2 Kb), genome organization and DNA sequence. The
Tags of SV40, BKV and JCV strongly cross-react with the
same antisera [6,7], while a less strong cross-reactivity is
observed in most structural antigenic determinants of the
viral proteins, named VP1, 2 and 3. A genus-specific capsid antigen, located on viral peptide VP1, has been identified [8]. The DNA sequences of SV40 share 70%
homology with BKV [9], and 69% with JCV [10]. The
greatest homology is found in the early region coding for
the Tags and tags, whereas a lower homology is detected
in the regulatory region.
SV40 Life Cycle in Host Cells
The cell infection starts by the binding of the SV40 virus
to a receptor on the cell membrane. This receptor has been
identified as the major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) [11]. In monkeys, initial lytic infection by SV40 is
controlled by the immune system. Then, SV40 persisting
infection occurs in the kidney cells where it may be reactivated by immunosuppression [12]. The life cycle of SV40
in humans is poorly understood [13]. After binding to the
cell surface, polyomavirus capsid undergoes endocytosis
and is transported to the nucleus where the viral DNA is
uncoated and transcription of the early region begins.
SV40 enters cells by caveola-mediated endocytosis [14].
The primary transcript from the early region is alternatively spliced to give two mRNAs that encode large Tag
and small tag. Tag is a nuclear phosphoprotein of 94 kD
and it is an essential factor for viral DNA replication. It
binds to the viral origin of replication (ori) where it pro-

http://www.infectagentscancer.com/content/2/1/13

motes unwinding of the double helix and recruitment of
cellular proteins that are required for DNA synthesis,
including DNA polymerase-α and replication protein A
[15-18]. SV40 relies on cellular enzymes and cofactors for
DNA replication and these proteins are expressed in S
phase. Tag modulates cellular signaling pathways to
induce cells to enter S phase and this accounts for the ability of Tag to transform cells. Large Tag is thought to stimulate the cell cycle through its ability to bind to several
cellular proteins that are involved in crucial signal transduction pathways that control cell cycle progression and
apoptosis [19]. The role of the small tag in the polyomavirus life cycle is less clear. Analysis of SV40 deletion
mutants revealed that tag is not essential for lytic infection
in culture [20]. However, tag cooperates with Tag in the
transformation of cells by SV40 [21,22] and increases
virus yield in permissive cells [23]. As viral replication
proceeds, the late genes begin to be expressed. In permissive cells, Tag acts to stimulate transcription from the late
promoter and represses transcription from the early promoter. The gene products of the late region are the capsid
proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3, which assemble with the replicated viral DNA to form virions, which are released upon
cell lysis. SV40 DNA can become integrated into the chromosomal DNA of the cell especially upon infection of
non-permissive cells [24]. Integration occurs at random
both in terms of the site in the cellular genome and in the
viral genome [25].
Different studies indicate that SV40 can replicate productively in human cells, including spongioblasts, fetal neural cells, newborn kidney cells [26], and some tumor cell
lines [27,28], although it grows poorly in human fibroblasts [29]. Some human cell types undergo visible cell lysis
in response to SV40 infection, whereas other cells fail to
exhibit cytopathic changes and produce low virus levels
[29]. Human mesothelial cells do not support the lytic
infection efficiently and are transformed at a high rate
(1,000 times higher than that of human fibroblasts) [30]
by SV40 or Tag alone [22,23], and release SV40 virions as
a result of the persistent infection [30,31]. The same
behavior has been observed in human lymphoblastoid Bcell lines where SV40 progeny is produced at a low level
[32]. This behavior peculiar to SV40 in specific human
cells, such as mesothelial cells, is uncommon for a DNA
tumor virus. Indeed, it is well established that DNA tumor
viruses either infect permissive cell lines with the production of an infectious viral progeny or infect and transform
non-permissive cells without a productive viral cycle.
SV40 Cell Transformation and Experimental
Tumorigenesis
Transformation of rodent and human cells by SV40 is
induced by the two oncoproteins, the large Tag and the
small tag, which display multiple functions. The main

activity of Tag for cell transformation and tumorigenesis is
to target key cellular proteins, such as the tumor suppressor p53 and pRB family proteins, inactivating their functions [13,19,33-40]. SV40 Tag may also lead to
transformation by inducing mutations to the cellular
genome [41] or numerical and structural alterations of
chromosomes [42,43], such as gaps, breaks, dicentric and
ring chromosomes, chromatid exchanges, deletions,
duplications and translocations [44].
The principal role of the small tag in transformation is to
bind the catalytic (36 kDa) and regulatory (63 kDa) subunits of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) [13,19], inactivating their function. Moreover, tag interacts with the
centrosome and blocks mitosis in human cells [45], suggesting that it may disrupt cell cycle progression. Recently,
it has been shown that in human mammary epithelial
cells tag activates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [46], an
enzyme involved in pathways crucial for cell proliferation
and transformation. In addition, SV40 tag is able to
enhance transcription from E2F-activated promoters of
early growth response genes [47,48].
The process of rodent cell transformation induced by
SV40 typically depends on the integration of the viral
DNA into the host genome where it produces a high level
of expression of the major viral oncogenic proteins, large
T antigen and small t antigen [13,19,33-36]. However,
human cells experimentally transformed by SV40 harbor
viral genomes in an episomal state, sometimes in great
number, in addition to integrated viral DNA [13,19,3336].
SV40 immortalized and transformed human cells [49-52]
are able to induce tumors when implanted subcutaneously in autologous hosts [51]. In some cases, SV40 Tag
needs cooperation of the catalytic subunit of telomerase
and the activated c-H-ras oncogene, for the complete
transformation of human cells, as shown in cotransfection experiments [53].
SV40 is highly oncogenic in rodents and when inoculated
subcutaneously, intracerebrally or intravenously in newborn hamsters induces soft tissue sarcomas, osteosarcomas, ependymomas and choroid plexus papillomas, and
neoplasms of the hematopoietic system, such as lymphocytic leukemia, histiocytic lymphomas and rarely, Bcell lymphomas [33,54-56]. Moreover, direct inoculation
of SV40 into the pleural space induces malignant mesothelioma in 100% of the injected hamsters [55]. The
oncogenic potential of SV40 is confirmed by the generation of transgenic mice in which polyomavirus large Tag
expression is regulated by the native viral early promoterenhancer [57]. SV40-transgenic mice, like rodents experimentally inoculated with the virus, develop ependymo-

mas and choroid plexus papillomas, as well as other
neoplasms [33,58-60].
Epidemiology of SV40 infection in humans
SV40 natural infection in humans is considered a rare
event, restricted to people living in contact with monkeys,
the natural hosts of the virus, such as inhabitants of
Indian villages located close to the jungle, and workers
attending to monkeys in zoos and animal facilities
[61,62]. A source of human exposure to SV40 occurred
between 1955 and 1963, when inactivated and live antipolio vaccines, prepared from polioviruses grown in naturally SV40-infected simian cell cultures, were administered to hundreds of millions of people in the United
States, Canada, Europe, Asia and Africa [63]. Soon it was
shown that children vaccinated with contaminated oral
polio vaccines (OPV) shed infectious SV40 in stools for at
least 5 weeks after vaccination [64]. However, some children, who received the same OPV, did not develop neutralizing antibodies even though they may have received
large doses of live SV40, compared with the potentially
inactivated SV40 in inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Further, SV40 human contamination occurred in experimental infection with live respiratory syncytial virus to adult
volunteers and a neutralizing antibody response in about
two thirds of the volunteers was shown [65]. Inactivated
vaccines against adenoviruses [66] and hepatitis A [67]
virus also exposed humans to SV40, although the amount
of infectious SV40 was almost certainly lower then that
administered with OPV or live respiratory syncytial virus.

Early serologic studies reported the presence of SV40 neutralizing antibodies, at different titles, in the population
that received IPV. Immune response appeared to correlate
with the amount of SV40 present in the vaccine; 30% to
50% of individuals reached a significant antibody
response against formalin-inactivated SV40 after three
doses of the vaccine. Antibody titles persisted for a period
of up to 3 years post-inoculation [68]. Additional serologic studies reported a SV40 seropositivity in individuals
with no history of immunization with contaminated IPV
or other possible route of SV40 infection [69-72]. Shah et
al., [72] detected antibodies to SV40 in children born after
1964, when IPV was free of SV40, as well as in people
born before 1954. These studies suggest that humans may
become infected by SV40 independently from poliovirus
vaccine exposure. However, most of these early serologic
studies were carried out before the discovery of the two
human polyomaviruses, BK and JC, which are close
related to SV40 and are ubiquitous in human populations. It is possible that the early serologic evidence of
SV40 antibody detection in human sera represents some
degree of cross reactivity with antibodies against the
highly related BK and JC viruses [73-75].

To date, the prevalence of SV40 infections in humans is
not known. Recent studies, based on PCR and serological
techniques, indicate that SV40 infection occurs both in
children and adults. (i) SV40 DNA sequences have been
detected in normal and neoplastic tissues of people either
too young (1 to 30 years) or too old (60 to 85 years) to
have been vaccinated with SV40-contaminated anti-polio
vaccines [19,33,76-81]. This finding may also explain the
lack of difference in cancer incidence between individuals
vaccinated with SV40-contaminated and SV40-free antipolio vaccines [82]. (ii) SV40 sequences and Tag were
detected in blood and sperm specimens from normal
individuals and oncologic patients [80,81,83-88] and in
lymphoblastoid cells [32]. These results suggest that
PBMCs could be a reservoir and vehicle of SV40 spreading
in the tissues of the host and among the individuals. (iii)
SV40 sequences were found in urine and stoole samples,
from children and adults [84,89,90], indicating that the
haematic, sexual and orofecal routes of transmission are
likely to be responsible for SV40 horizontal infection in
humans. (iv) Infectious SV40 was rescued by transfection
of permissive CV-1 monkey cells with the DNA of an
SV40-positive human choroid plexus carcinoma, one
blood and one HPV-infected normal vulvar tissue samples
[91,92]. Finally, specific antibodies to SV40 capsid antigens have recently been found in human sera [93-104].
Unfortunately there is no comparative data on the SV40
DNA prevalence in PBMC and antibodies presence to
SV40 antigens in sera from the same patients.

version to SV40 [100,101], suggesting that most of the
SV40 antibodies present in human sera are not generated
by infection with BKV or JCV. (iv) In sera from two immunosuppressed renal transplant patients, that were examined sequentially for antibodies to BKV, JCV and SV40
over a period of 82 and 51 weeks, respectively, a significant rise in SV40 antibody titers was detected [97], indicating that a latent SV40 infection, like BKV and JCV latent
infection, can be reactivated in humans by immunosuppression. Moreover, during the post-transplant follow-up,
the evolving profile of antibodies to SV40 was clearly different from that of antibodies to either BKV or JCV [97],
suggesting a specific immunological response to SV40 in
these two patients.

Among recent SV40 serologic investigations, some data
suggest that specific SV40 antibodies are present in
human sera: (i) in a collection of human sera from
Morocco, 100% of the samples had antibodies to SV40
[97], whereas in the same study other sera from Morocco,
Zaire, Sierra Leone and Poland contained SV40 antibodies
in 0.4 to 5.3% of the samples [97], a figure which corresponds with the results of other surveys [93,101]. All the
sera in the 100% positive Moroccan collection were from
cases of poliomyelitis in children under five years of age
[97]. These children, therefore, had probably not been
vaccinated against poliovirus. This result should not be
overestimated, especially because the collection of the
100% anti-SV40-positive sera was made up of only 29
samples. Nevertheless, this observation suggests that,
under particular circumstances, humans can display a
great specific antibody response to SV40. Perhaps, the
overt poliomyelitis syndrome has influenced the immunological reaction of affected patients to SV40. (ii)
Although it is obviously difficult, due to the ubiquity of
the two human polyomaviruses, to find a human serum
positive for SV40 and negative for both BKV and JCV antibodies, one such serum was detected [100]. (iii) While
seroconversion to BKV and JCV is age-dependent
[105,106], there is no data on the age-dependent serocon-

The antigenic cross-reaction of SV40 with the two human
polyomaviruses BK and JC has been, so far, the most difficult problem in studying the real diffusion of SV40 infection in humans. Carter et al. [108], using recombinant
SV40 VP1 virus-like particles (VLPs) as antigen in an
ELISA test, detected antibodies to SV40 in 6,6% of human
sera, whereas SV40 reactivity in the same sera disappeared
after serum pre-adsorption with BKV and JCV VLPs. Due
to the different results obtained before and after preadsorption with BKV and JCV VLPs, this study suggests
that most of the seropositivity for SV40 is actually caused
by cross reactivity to BKV or JCV [93-100]. The authors
concluded that authentic SV40 antibodies are absent in
human sera and therefore SV40 does not appear to be a
prevalent human pathogen. However, some considerations can be made on the validity of SV40 studies using
VLPs. Due to the sequence homology of the VP1 structural
proteins (i.e., more than 80% identical) in the three polyomaviruses, BKV, JCV, and SV40, it is not surprising that
the vast majority of the human antibody repertoire
against the VP1 protein of the three polyomaviruses can
largely overlap. This cross-reactivity, in turn, increases the
probability that immunodominant epitopes are present
within the family of VP1 antigenic determinants common
to all three polyomaviruses. Coexistence of immunodom-

Some other recent SV40 serological studies, using virus
neutralization and ELISA test, showed antibodies to SV40
in a limited number (1.3 to 15.6%) of normal human
sera, suggesting a low virus circulation in the human population [102-104,107]. Other studies have examined seroprevalence for SV40 in cancer patients compared with
controls using viral-like-particle (VLP)- based assays,
which detect antibodies that are specific to the major capsid protein VP1 of SV40, BKV, and JCV [97-104,107].
These studies showed that SV40 seroprevalence is similar
between cancer patients compared with controls (ranging
from 5% to 10%) and suggest that no association exists
between SV40 seroprevalence and either immunization
with poliovirus vaccine or cancer incidence [99,100,104].

inance and cross-reactivity has been largely documented
in the literature [109]. Thus, both qualitative and quantitative differences in the antibody response to the epitopes
present only in the SV40 VP1 structural protein may be
difficult to determine, particularly if an assay based on
serum preadsorption with BKV and JCV VLP is used as the
sole means of detection. Therefore, due to the great
homology of the VP1 structural protein in the three polyomaviruses, preadsorption with BKV and JCV VLPs may
have removed from human sera most of the SV40 antibodies, which cross-reacted with human polyomavirus
capsid antigens. Furthermore, it is worth noting that
ELISA tests can detect non-neutralizing antibodies and
some cross-reactivity is not unexpected among the three
polyomaviruses. In theory, VLPs should resemble native
virions and retain some of their immunological features.
However, polyomaviruses VLPs based assays used the VP1
capsid protein, a highly homologous structural protein
among the three viruses. Altogether these considerations
suggest that the validity of SV40 studies using VLPs assays
is problematic [110].
The site of SV40 latent infection in humans is unknown.
Detection of SV40 in human kidney and urine [84,85,89]
points to the kidney as a site of virus latency, like in the
natural monkey host [111,112]. Clues to the mechanisms
of SV40 transmission in humans may come from studies
of the natural infection in monkeys [112]. Since uninfected weaning animals do not frequently seroconvert
when grouped with the infected mothers or littermates, it
seems most likely that transmission of SV40 in monkeys,
under conditions of natural infection, occurs after weaning from the environment rather than directly from other
animals [112]. Interestingly, this observation would support SV40 transmission in humans from the contaminated general environment or from the home
environment [90]. Finally, SV40, as with other tumor
viruses, tends to establish long-term persistent infection,
as compared with the self-limited infection typical of
most common viruses [113]. Therefore, the response of
the host exerts constant pressure on chronic virus infection and, in defence, viruses contain genes that have the
potential to modulate such host responses. Indeed, recent
data indicate that SV40 miRNAs downregulate Tag, a target of the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response expression, promoting the CTL evasion in "in vivo" conditions
[4,5]. Thus, down-regulating the accumulation of unnecessary Tag, the SV40 miRNAs reduce CTL susceptibility
and local cytokine release. Although this down-regulation
is dispensable for viral growth in culture, it is likely to be
of considerable importance "in vivo". Predicted hairpin
structure for the pre-miRNA is not only found in all SV40
isolates, but also conserved in other primate polyomaviruses, including BKV and JCV [4,5].

SV40 in human non-malignant specimens
SV40 sequences were detected in kidney and cells of urine
sediments from patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and SV40 was isolated by co-cultivation of cells
from urine sediments of such patients with CV-1 monkey
cells [84,85]. SV40 DNA was localized to renal tubular
epithelial cell nuclei in renal biopsies of patients with
focal segmental glomerulosclerosis as determined by in
situ hybridization. Several strains of SV40 were rescued in
this study, including strain 776 and other strains bearing
mutations in the early and late regions [85]. One study
reported that SV40 and BKV sequences have been codetected in the kidneys of patients with post-transplantation interstitial nephritis thus suggesting that SV40 may
cooperate in the etiopathogenesis of this chronic disease
[84]. Moreover, the presence of SV40 in kidney tissue
[84,85] and urine [89] points to the kidney as a site of
virus latency, like in the natural monkey host [111,112].
Other studies showed that SV40 DNA sequences from the
viral regulatory region were detected and identified in the
allografts of immunocompromised pediatric renal transplant recipients and in the native kidneys of a young adult
lung transplant patient with polyomavirus nephropathy
[94,114]. Different studies have detected SV40 DNA
sequences in PBMCs from various patient populations
[32,80,81,83,85,88]. These results demonstrate the nephrotropic and lymphotropic properties of SV40 and indicate that the kidney can serve as a reservoir for the virus in
humans. It appears that patients with acquired and/or
iatrogenic immunosuppression are a population at risk
for SV40. However, the frequency, natural history, and
morbidity of the virus in this increasing patient population are unclear.
Association of SV40 with human tumor specimens
SV40 sequences have been found, mainly by PCR methods, in different human cancers including mesothelioma,
osteosarcoma, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and some
different lymphoproliferative disorders, a variety of childhood brain tumors such as ependymoma and choroid
plexus tumors, as well as thyroid, pituitary and parotid
gland tumors [32,76-81,87,115-140]. These human
tumors correspond to the neoplasms that are induced by
SV40 experimental inoculation in rodents [33] or by generation of transgenic mice with the SV40 early region gene
directed by its own early promoter-enhancer [57-59].
SV40 sequences were detected in most cases by PCR. However, in two independent studies SV40 sequences were
detected, by Southern blot hybridization, integrated in
human osteosarcomas and thyroid tumors [130,131]. In
addition, infectious SV40 was isolated from a choroid
plexus carcinoma as well as from one blood sample and
one HPV-infected vulvar tissue sample [91,92]. Two independent studies, conducted in human brain tumor samples [80] and kidney biopsies from patients affected by

post-transplantation nephritis [85], showed co-detection
of SV40 and BKV sequences in the same sample, suggesting a possible co-operation/helper function between the
two polyomaviruses in human cells. However, other studies examining polyomaviruses in brain cancers using
primers capable of detecting the three polyomaviruses
have not reported co-infection [76,115,117,126,135].
Different types of lymphomas and other lymphoproliferative disorders, from immunosuppressed/HIV+ patients,
tested positive for SV40 sequences and Tag expression
[87,119,120]. However, the SV40 prevalence in lymphomas from immunosuppressed/HIV+ and HIV-negative
oncologic patients did not differ substantially. The semipermissiveness of human cells to SV40 infections may
explain the restricted multiplication of the virus even in
the immunosuppression condition of the host.
Some of the above mentioned studies also demonstrated
the messenger RNA of SV40 Tag by RT-PCR and/or the
viral oncoprotein presence by immunohistochemistry in
tumor tissues [32,76,129]. On the contrary, other studies
failed to demonstrate both SV40 sequences and Tag protein using similar technical approaches in the same tumor
kind [122,141-144]. It has been suggested that different
techniques employed in DNA extraction and purification
from human specimens may account for the SV40-negative data [87]. Indeed, some popular commercial kits do
not allow the recovery of the small SV40 DNA (5.2 kb)
when present in a low amount and in the episomal state
[81]. In addition, it has been reported that SV40 DNA
sequences could be amplified by PCR with certain sets of
primers but not with others [76,77,122]. These discrepancies have led to questions regarding the sensitivity and
specificity of PCR-based detection of SV40 as well as the
possibility of false-positive results caused by laboratory
contamination. To settle this dispute, two multi-institutional studies were performed to examine the presence of
SV40 in human malignant mesotheliomas [136,142].
Unfortunately, the two investigations reached opposite
conclusions, leaving the question unresolved.
Recently, Lopez-Rios et al., [145] raised the possibility
that false-positive results could be amplified from common laboratory vectors which contain one or more of
SV40 viral DNA elements. Further, Manfredi et al., [146]
have failed to detect SV40 sequences in their tumor specimens. These authors call into question all previous studies
that have used PCR methods to detect SV40 in human
tumors, because they were conducted with primers that
can amplify DNA present in common laboratory plasmids. The issue of possible laboratory contamination of
specimens is not a new argument. It should be pointed
out that, in the recent years, rigorous precautions have
been taken in most studies. It is reasonable to suppose
that, if SV40-based plasmid contamination occurred dur-

http://www.infectagentscancer.com/content/2/1/13

ing sample processing, it would affect a very large number
of samples and frequency of SV40 detection by PCR in
human tumors would be higher than that reported. In this
context, it should borne in mind that in recent investigations SV40 Tag mRNA and/or Tag protein have been
detected both in fresh and paraffin-embedded tissues
[76,107,129,137]. Moreover, in human specimens
sequence variability in the SV40 Tag C-terminal coding
region and regulatory region have been detected [79,125130,147,148], thus adding additional support to the circulation of different SV40 strains in humans. Indeed,
many reports indicate that different SV40 strains and variants are distributed throughout the human population
and consequently in human specimens [149]. Variations
in the Tag-C gene region have frequently been detected in
human tumor associated sequences [79,150,151]. The
Tag-C sequence was shown to be stable during the tissue
culture passage of SV40 isolates [150]. In contrast, the
SV40 regulatory region may contain large insertions, deletions or duplications [151], and rearrangements have
been observed to occur within individual infected monkeys [152] and during the passage of SV40 in certain cultured cells [153]. Several SV40 genotypes from monkeys,
contaminated vaccines and humans, are common to different population sources. Interestingly, studies based on
known isolates and genomic fragments indicate that monkeys, vaccine and human populations contain SV40 genotypes both with one and two 72-bp repeats in the
enhancer domain of the regulatory region. Studies derived
from the United States mainly detected one 72-bp repeat
in human tumor tissues although SV40 regulatory region
sequences with two 72-bp repeats were also detected in
human osteosarcoma and mesothelioma samples
[78,151]. Moreover, SV40 wild type strain 776, which has
two 72-bp repeats in the enhancer domain of the regulatory region, was the main representative among the different SV40 strains detected in kidney, urine and blood
samples of an American group consisting of normal people and patients affected by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis [84]. In a recent study carried out in Italy, SV40
sequences were detected in peripheral blood lymphocytes
from Caucasian organ donors of different ages [154].
Interestingly, the SV40 regulatory region detected in these
human specimens showed DNA sequence variability. This
result confirms and extends previous data on the circulation of different SV40 strains and variants in different
populations. In addition, the presence of SV40 sequences
in people born before and after the introduction of SV40contaminated vaccine suggests that (i) SV40 is spreading
by horizontal infection and probably (ii) other unidentified sources of SV40 infection may exist [19].
It has been shown that some vaccine-derived SV40 genotypes overlap with those detected in monkey and in
human populations, supporting the hypothesis that con-

taminated vaccines may play a role in the introduction of
SV40 into the human population [155]. Moreover, it
should be noted that viral isolates from humans with one
72-bp in the regulatory region have not diverged from
monkey isolates, showing that adaptation is not essential
for viral survival in humans [155].
As mentioned above, SV40 sequences in human tumors
were often detected at low level, less than one genome
equivalent per cell [87], while the Tag expression when
detected was revealed only in a fraction of tumor cells
[87]. These data obtained with human specimens differ
from the results from rodent cells, where the SV40
sequences are present in each cell and the SV40 Tag must
be continuously expressed to transform the cell and then
to maintain transformation. In order to understand, at
least in part, these differences between human and rodent
models, some considerations should be made. It is well
established that the SV40 Tag induces chromosome aberrations [42,43] which are likely to affect the functions of
genes involved in tumorigenesis, such as oncogenes,
tumor suppressor and DNA repair genes [155-158]. Once
chromosomal damage has been triggered in tumors and
chromosomal aberrations have reached a threshold,
genomic instability ensues [158], due to the functional
alteration of DNA repair genes, leading to more genetic
lesions and tumor progression [158,159]. This process
does not need the long-period maintenance of the original oncogenic agent that caused the injury and initiated
the tumorigenesis process. Therefore, in human cells SV40
could initiate the tumorigenic process by hitting the cell
genome, then it could become dispensable and lost in the
progression phase of the tumor, when the accumulation
of genetic alterations renders the presence of viral transforming functions unnecessary. Immunoselection may
even be exerted against persistently SV40-infected cells,
while genetically mutated and uninfected cells may have
a proliferative advantage and become the prevalent population in the tumor tissue. This "hit and run" mechanism
was originally proposed to explain transformation of
human cells by the mutagenic herpesviruses [160,161],
and has been recently suggested to be effective in colorectal carcinogenesis associated with JC virus, a polyomavirus closely related to SV40 [162]. On the contrary, in
SV40-transformed rodent cells, SV40 sequences are not
lost. This difference mainly depends on rodent cells,
which are non-permissive to SV40 multiplication. Therefore, the input viral DNA is integrated into the cell
genome [33]. Since many human cells are semi-permissive to SV40 infection, the viral genome replicates poorly
in these cells. Consequently, the few replicated DNA molecules remain in the episomal state, or are even lost, in a
fraction of the cells [26]. Another mechanism of transformation, the paracrine mechanism, exerted by the SV40
Tag has been revealed in murine and canine cells. Indeed,

http://www.infectagentscancer.com/content/2/1/13

it has been shown that the insulin-like growth factor type
I (IGF-I) and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) are secreted
in SV40-positive cells [162,163] and may stimulate proliferation/transformation. Similarly, in human mesothelial
cells SV40 Tag activates an autocrine/paracrine loop,
involving the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its cellular receptor, which is the product of the oncogene c-met
[31], as well as the vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF) and its cellular receptor VEGFR [165,166]. HGF
and VEGF, released from SV40-positive human cells, bind
their receptors in neighboring and distant SV40-positive
and SV40-negative cells, driving them into proliferation
and tumorigenesis. In this human cell model only one cell
out of 100/1000 needs to express the Tag to transform all
the cells of the monolayer [31,165,166].
Suggestive data are available on the role of SV40 Tag in the
pathogenesis of human mesothelioma: (i) its ability to
bind in vivo p53 and RB family proteins in human mesothelioma samples [167,168]; (ii) activation of Notch-1,
a gene promoting cell cycle progression and cell proliferation, in primary human mesothelial cells [169]; (iii)
induction of apoptosis in mesothelioma cells transfected
with antisense DNA to the SV40 early region gene [170];
(iv) the presence of SV40 Tag-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in sera of patients affected by mesothelioma
[171]; and (v) the poorer prognosis of mesotheliomas
harboring SV40 early region sequences compared to
SV40-negative mesotheliomas [172]. Moreover, mesothelial cells are particularly susceptible to infection and transformation by SV40 [30,31]. Asbestos, which is the main
cause of human mesothelioma, cooperates with SV40 in
transformation of murine cells as well as of human fibroblasts and mesothelial cells [30,173,174], suggesting that
SV40 and asbestos may be co-carcinogens in the onset of
the mesothelioma. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis has indicated that the RB and cyclin E/CDK2 genes
undergo the same type of deregulation during the cell
cycle in asbestos treated and SV40-transformed human
mesothelial cells as well as in mesothelioma cells [175].
Recently, it has been shown that SV40 tumor antigens
induce telomerase activity in human mesothelial cells, but
not in human fibroblasts [174], suggesting that both SV40
oncoproteins specifically participate in the immortalization of mesothelial cells during mesothelioma development.

Conclusion
The problems related to SV40 infection in the human
population and to SV40 contribution to human cancer
have been summarized in the recent evaluation of the
"Immunization Safety Review Committee" established by
the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies [176].
The Committee stated that "the evidence is inadequate to
accept or reject a causal relationship between SV40-con-

taining polio vaccines and cancer". In fact, the epidemiological studies conducted in the past are flawed by the
difficulty in establishing which individuals received contaminated vaccines, in determining the dosage of infectious SV40 present in different lots of vaccine (due to
formalin inactivation of poliovirus which may have variably affected SV40 infectivity), and finally in observing
large cohorts of subjects for several decades after virus
exposure to monitor for cancer development [155]. The
Committee concluded that "the biological evidence is
strong that SV40 is a transforming virus, but it is of moderate strength that SV40 exposure from polio vaccine is
related to SV40 infection in humans and that SV40 exposure could lead to cancer in humans under natural conditions". The Committee also recommended the
development of specific and sensitive serologic tests for
SV40 and the use of standardized techniques that should
be accepted and shared by all laboratories involved in
SV40 detection. Although it may seem somehow a premature effort, the conviction that SV40 is implicated as a
cofactor in the etiology of some human tumors has
prompted programs to prepare a vaccine against the main
viral oncoprotein, the SV40 Tag [177]. A recombinant vaccinia vector containing a safety-modified SV40 Tag
sequence has been constructed [177]. Such a modified Tag
excludes the p53 and RB protein binding sites as well as
the amino-terminal oncogenic CRI and J domains [38],
but preserves the immunogenic regions. Tumorigenesis
studies carried out in vivo indicate that this vector can efficiently prime the immune response to provide effective,
antigen specific prophylactic and therapeutic protection
against SV40 Tag-expressing lethal tumors [178].
