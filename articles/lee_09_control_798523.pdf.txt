Abstract
Background: Dicer is an RNase III-ribonuclease that initiates the formation of small interfering
RNAs as a defence against genomic parasites such as retrotransposons. Despite intensive
characterization in mammalian species, the biological functions of Dicer in controlling
retrotransposable elements of the non-mammalian vertebrate are poorly understood. In this
report, we examine the role of chicken Dicer in controlling the activity of chicken CR1
retrotransposable elements in a chicken-human hybrid DT40 cell line employing a conditional lossof-Dicer function.
Results: Retrotransposition is detrimental to host genome stability and thus eukaryotic cells have
developed mechanisms to limit the expansion of retrotransposons by Dicer-mediated RNAi
silencing pathways. However, the mechanisms that control the activity and copy numbers of
transposable elements in chicken remain unclear. Here, we describe how the loss of Dicer in
chicken cells does not reactivate endogenous chicken CR1 retrotransposons with impaired RNAi
machinery, suggesting that the control of chicken CR1 is independent of Dicer-induced RNAi
silencing. In contrast, upon introduction of a functionally active human L1 retrotransposable
element that contains an active 5' UTR promoter, the Dicer-deficient chicken cells show a strong
increase in the accumulation of human L1 transcripts and retrotransposition activity, highlighting a
major difference between chicken CR1 and other mammalian L1 retrotransposons.
Conclusion: Our data provide evidence that chicken CR1 retrotransposons, unlike their
mammalian L1 counterparts, do not undergo retrotransposition because most CR1
retrotransposons are truncated or mutated at their 5'UTR promoters and thus are not subjected
to Dicer-mediated RNAi-silencing control.

Background
The chicken is an important model organism for the largescale analysis of vertebrate genome structure, function
and evolution. The chicken shares most of its biology with
mammals but, being evolutionarily distinct, it serves as a

useful resource for the discovery of a wide range of biological processes [1]. The recent release of a draft chicken
genome sequence has substantially increased our understanding of its genomic landscape and provided additional insight into the comparative analyses of the chicken

and mammalian genomes [2]. The chicken has a relatively
small genome of approximately 1200 Mb, roughly threefold smaller than that of mammalian genomes. Surprisingly, less than 9% of the chicken genome contains
transposable elements, compared with 40 to 50% in most
mammals [3]. It is not yet known whether the low density
of repetitive DNA elements in the chicken is due to low
transposable element activity or to a lack of active retrotransposons in the chicken genome. The mechanisms that
control the activity and copy numbers of chicken transposable elements remain unclear.
The most abundant transposable elements in the chicken
genome (approximately 80%) belong to the CR1 families
of LINE retrotransposons (Chicken Repetitive 1 Elements
or CR1). The CR1 element resembles the mammalian L1
element in having a 5'UTR, followed by two open reading
frames (ORFs) and a 3'UTR. A full-length CR1 element is
approximately 4.5 kb in length. ORF1 has potential to
encode a nucleic acid-binding protein of approximately
36 kDa containing a zinc-finger like motif; however, the
exact function of ORF1 is not yet known [4]. ORF2
encodes a protein of approximately 95 kDa with critical
endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities as found
in mammalian L1s, and is responsible for replication of
the element. The majority of CR1 elements are truncated
and mutated at their 5'ends, which is required for their
transcription; nonetheless, there are a few copies of CR1
elements potentially capable of retrotransposition in the
chicken genome [5,6]. Remarkably, the 3'UTR sequences
of all CR1 subfamilies lack polyadenylated tails and
instead contain two to four copies of a unique 8 bp
(ATTCTRTG) repeat [4,6]. Interestingly, polyadenylated
tails in mammals are potential substrates for L1 reverse
transcriptase, probably explaining the abundance of processed pseudogenes in mammals compared with the
chicken genome.
Little is known about the activity and function of chicken
CR1 elements. The first draft of chicken genome reveals
that at least 11 CR1 elements have the potential to produce functionally active elements, implying a role for
these elements in shaping the chicken genome [3,4]. To
date, more than 21 CR1 elements have been deposited in
RepBase (2005). The chicken genome probably contains
around 26,650 copies of the CR1 element (on the basis of
BLASTN searches against the CR1 consensus sequence
(accession no. U88211)) scattered throughout the
genome. Despite this high number, it has been a puzzle as
how these elements are transcribed and maintained in the
chicken genome [3,4]. Given the low density of interspersed repeats in the chicken, mechanisms must exist to
control the activity of CR1 retrotransposition. It remains
to be elucidated how the copy number of transposons is
controlled in the chicken genome and to what extent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/53

RNAi-mediated silencing mechanisms contribute to the
activity of CR1 elements.
RNAi silencing machinery is highly conserved across
eukaryotes. It may have initially evolved to defend the
genome against invading transposable elements and
other genomic parasites [7]. Recent studies in Caenorhabditis elegans [8], Drosophila [9,10] and cultured human
cells [11,12] have shown that knockdown of RNAi
machinery increases transcript abundance of retrotransposable elements. These findings all suggest that there is
ongoing control of retrotransposon proliferation in the
host [13]. However, it is not clear whether such controlling mechanisms of retrotransposons are currently active
in the chicken genome. To explore this hypothesis, we
knocked down Dicer gene expression in chicken DT40
cells and investigated the effects of siRNAs on CR1 transcripts. Here, we show that control of chicken CR1 is independent of the chicken RNAi machinery. The depletion of
chicken Dicer did not result in increased expression of
chicken CR1 elements. However, when we introduced
human L1 elements into DT40 cells, in which Dicer
expression was reduced, a cell culture-based retrotransposition assay showed a marked increase in L1 expression
and retrotransposition activity but not of endogenous
chicken CR1 transposons.

Results
A key step in the RNA silencing pathway is the cleavage of
double-stranded RNA precursors by Dicer to produce
functional siRNAs. In a number of organisms, siRNAs
have been implicated in silencing retrotransposable elements [7,14]. To understand the biological function of the
RNAi pathway against the chicken CR1 elements, we used
a conditional loss-of-Dicer function in a chicken-human
hybrid DT40 cell line that containing a single copy of
human chromosome 21 [15]. A conditional knockout of
Dicer was generated in which a tetracycline-repressible
promoter controlled the expression of Dicer. In the presence of doxycycline (Dox), a gradual loss of Dicer protein
was observed, with complete loss 48 h after addition of
Dox (Figure 1A). Quantitative RT-PCR with primers specific for chicken Dicer revealed that mRNA levels were up
to 92% lower in Dox-induced DT40 cells than in the control cells (Figure 1B; P = 0.001). Moreover, the Dicer-deficient chicken cells survived for up to 6 days and their
phenotype was almost indistinguishable from that of
wild-type DT40 cells (data not shown). To further confirm
the loss of Dicer function, we analysed the aberrant accumulation of transcripts from α-satellite DNA repeats in
Dicer-deficient DT40 cells (see Additional file 1, Figure
S1). Consistent with previous research [15], loss of Dicer
in chicken cells resulted in increased levels of transcripts
from α-satellite sequences through the disruption of
Dicer-related RNAi silencing machinery.

Upregulation of mammalian L1 transcripts in Dicerdeficient chicken cells
Dicer-mediated gene silencing is an evolutionally conserved system across eukaryotes. Previous studies in cultured human cells have identified that RNAi machinery
elicited by the antisense transcripts of L1 retrotransposons
can suppress L1 expression and retrotransposition efficiency [11]. To demonstrate the direct role of chicken
Dicer in transposon silencing, and also to rule out the possibility that chicken may have multiple Dicer enzymes (as
seen in Neurospora and Aspergillus [16,17]) that are redundantly responsible for transposon-specific silencing, we
used human chromosome 21 as a source of mammalian
L1 elements in chicken-human hybrid DT40 cells. This
system has two unique advantages: first, it allows us to
study L1 expression from a natural chromosomal environment rather than from transfected plasmids; second, as
human L1 sequences are completely different from
chicken CR1 elements, it is easy to identify the transcript
abundance of L1 retrotransposons by quantitative RT-PCR
analysis without interference from chicken CR1 transposable elements.

Human chromosome 21 contains 65 copies of a fulllength L1 element determined by TBLAST and L1Base
searches [18] using the consensus sequence of the active
L1 element (accession no. AF148856). Although the
majority of predicted L1 elements contain both ORF1 and
ORF2, all but one of them carry mutations and frame-shift
interruptions or in-frame stop codons. Only one copy of
the L1 element in human chromosome 21 (position
17669229 – 17676620) appeared to be functional with
an ability to produce both ORFs active proteins. Using
real-time quantitative RT-PCR, we first compared the
abundance of L1 transcripts in Dicer-deficient and control
DT40 cells. Remarkably, Dicer knockdown in chicken
cells resulted in a significant increase (around 1.6-fold) in
the levels of both ORF1 and ORF2 transcripts derived
from L1 element of human chromosome 21 (Figure 1D; P
= 0.005 and P = 0.006 for ORF1 and ORF2, respectively).
In addition, we also confirmed the increased expression of
L1 transcripts upon loss of Dicer by strand-specific RTPCR analysis (Figure 1C), suggesting that Dicer may be
required for silencing of human L1 retrotransposons.
These data also imply that the Dicer-mediated RNAi
silencing pathway is functional in chicken DT40 cells and
enables them to control the levels of human L1 retrotransposons.
Since Dicer is a crucial component in the RNAi pathway,
which processes dsRNA precursors to functional siRNAs,
loss of Dicer may contribute to an increased expression of
L1 transcripts due to the absence of, or poorly processed,
siRNAs against L1 elements. An equally important possibility is that loss of Dicer also affects miRNA processing,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/53

and thus the increased expression of L1 transcripts in the
absence of Dicer could be an effect of miRNA dysregulation that targets L1 expression directly, or indirectly
through miRNA-mediated regulation of cellular factors
that suppress L1 expression. Although bona fide siRNAs
or miRNAs that control the human L1 elements are yet to
be isolated, a previous study in cultured human cells [11]
has shown that the Dicer knockdown or deletion of L1's
antisense promoter increases the levels of L1 expression,
suggesting that the siRNAs derived from the active L1 promoter control L1 expression. To confirm that the Dicer
knockdown in chicken cells affects L1-derived small RNAs
processing and thus the increased expression of L1 transcripts, we analysed the accumulation of small RNAs in
control and Dicer-deficient DT40 cells (Figure 1E). Northern blot analysis shows reduced accumulation of L1-specific siRNAs in Dicer-depleted cells (up to 61 ± 3% as
measured by signal density quantification) compared
with control cells, but not their complete absence, even
though the level of Dicer was almost completely lost 48 h
after addition of Dox. It is not clear whether the leftover
small RNAs in Dicer-depleted cells are pre-existing siRNAs
or poorly processed siRNAs upon the loss of Dicer. Nonetheless, this study shows that the reduced levels of L1-specific small RNAs in Dicer-deficient cells correlate with
upregulation of the human L1 transcripts.
Dicer knockdown activated mammalian L1
retrotransposition
To further confirm that the Dicer is indeed required for
controlling human L1 expression and retrotransposition,
we introduced L1 expression cassettes harbouring a retrotransposition indicator for cell culture-based assay
[11,19]. This cassette consists of a full-length human L1
tagged at its 3'UTR with an antisense enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene, which is driven by a
cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter (Figure 2A). The EGFP
gene is disrupted by a γ-globin intron in the same orientation as the L1 transcript. This arrangement ensures that
EGFP expression occurs only after L1 transcription, splicing of the intron, reverse-transcription, and insertion of
the L1 copy back into chromosomal DNA (that is, after
the retrotransposition event).

The chicken DT40 cells were electroporated with an active
L1 element (pCMV-RP99-eGFP) and assayed for EGFP
expression in the presence or absence of Dox. An inactive
L1 (pCMV-ΔRP99-eGFP) that contained two missense
mutations in ORF1 [19] to abrogate retrotransposition
activity was used as a negative control. Cells expressing L1
were screened for EGFP expression by flow cytometry in
order to compare the L1 retrotransposition events
between Dicer-deficient and control DT40 cells. EGFPpositive cells were not detected in any of the control cells,
even after several passages; PCR analysis also confirmed

BMC Biology 2009, 7:53

the absence of the retrotransposed or spliced EGFP in control cells (Figure 2B). This observation suggests that no retrotransposition events occurred in the chicken cells that
contained intact Dicer and RNAi pathways. Strikingly,
Dicer knockdown in chicken cells resulted in a significant
increase in EGFP-positive cells (0.8 ± 0.07%) after 48 h
addition of Dox, indicating that Dicer is indeed required
for controlling the expression of human L1 elements. PCR
analysis of chicken genomic DNA also confirmed the
splicing of the intron in the EGFP gene in Dicer-deficient
cells; these cells remained EGFP-positive for 5 days in culture and then ceased to proliferate upon loss of Dicer and
subsequently died before 7 days by apparent cell death or
apoptosis [15]. Furthermore, we also observed a correlation between the relative abundance of L1 transcripts and
retrotransposition events by real-time quantitative RTPCR analysis (Figure 2C). The level of L1 transcripts was
almost doubled after Dicer knockdown (P = 0.004 and P
= 0.007 respectively for L1's ORF1 and ORF2) suggesting
that chicken Dicer gives rise to an inhibitory effect on retrotransposition by reducing the levels of L1 transcripts,
most probably via L1-derived siRNAs.
Dicer is not responsible for silencing of chicken CR1
transposons
If siRNAs were responsible for controlling the copy numbers of chicken CR1 transposons, one would expect that
depletion of siRNAs by Dicer knockdown would lead to a
higher level of endogenous chicken CR1 transcripts in the
chicken genome. To examine whether chicken Dicer is
responsible for processing siRNAs acting against the
chicken CR1 transposons, we used both strand-specific
RT-PCR (targeting the sense message) and real-time quantitative RT-PCR to assess the transcript levels of CR1-B elements in DT40 cells in the presence or absence of Dox for
2 days. Unexpectedly, there was no significant difference
in transcript accumulation of chicken CR1 elements in
Dicer-deficient cells compared with control DT40 cells
(Figure 3A). The mRNA levels of both ORF1 and ORF2 of
CR1-B elements in Dicer-deficient and control DT40 cells
were close to background levels, as determined by realtime quantitative RT-PCR (Figure 3B; P = 0.004 and P =
0.006 for ORF1 and ORF2, respectively). Consistently,
regardless of whether Dicer was weakly or strongly
depleted, Dicer knockdown did not increase CR1 mRNA
levels (data not shown). To further confirm this finding,
we analysed transcript levels of the functionally active
CR1-F element in chicken chromosome 6 (positions
2162180 – 2166909) [4]. Again, we found a basal level of
CR1 transcription that was similar in both control and
Dicer-deficient DT40 cells (Figure 3D). These data were
further confirmed by strand-specific RT-PCR analysis targeting the sense message of CR1 elements (Figure 3C),
suggesting that the Dicer-related RNAi machinery may not
be responsible for controlling the endogenous chicken
CR1 elements.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/53

Next, to determine whether the CR1 elements are able to
produce any transcription, we transfected the chicken
DT40 cells with luciferase reporter constructs whose
expression is driven by either functionally active CR1-B
5'UTR or L1 5'UTR as a promoter and performed the
Dual-Luciferase assay with the Renilla luciferase plasmid.
In this way, we measured promoter activity in the presence or absence of Dicer. As expected, transcript level of
the human L1 5'UTR promoter in Dicer-depleted DT40
cells was around twofold greater than that of control cells
but not chicken CR1-B 5'UTR promoter, whose level of
expression was almost comparable to that of the control
DT40 cells (Figure 3F). This observation suggests that the
chicken CR-1 elements may not be controlled by the
Dicer-mediated RNAi pathway. Interestingly, when we
reprobed the northern blot of small RNAs against the mixture of synthetic sense-strand CR1-B 5'UTR sequences, we
were not able to detect any CR1-specific antisense transcripts, regardless of whether the Dicer was present or
absent (data not shown). This suggests that the CR1 promoter may not produce any siRNAs like the human L1
5'UTR promoter. Remarkably, according to the luciferase
reporter assay, L1 promoter seems to be at least sixfold
stronger than that of the CR1 element (Figure 3E), indicating the existence of major differences between chicken
CR1 and other mammalian L1 elements in their 5'UTRs,
which
conceivably
function
as
promoters.
Very few CR1 5'UTR promoters are functional
Evidence from RNAi silencing of human L1 retrotransposons suggests that the first step for RNAi machinery is
synthesis of dsRNAs from the transcriptionally active
5'UTRs of retrotransposons [11,14,20]. The human L1
5'UTR is known to contain a bidirectional promoter (both
sense and antisense promoters) that leads to the production of dsRNAs, which are processed by Dicer into siRNAs.
To investigate the possibility that chicken 5'UTRs might
transcribe dsRNAs, perhaps through DNA hypomethylation, we analysed all putative 5'UTRs of chicken CR1 elements identified through literature and database searches.
A BLASTN search against a CR1 consensus sequence (GenBank Acc. U88211) suggests that the chicken genome
probably contains around 26,650 copies of the CR1 element scattered throughout the genome. To identify potentially active CR1 elements with intact promoters, the
5'UTRs of the previously identified active F and B subfamilies [4,6] were initially used for a Blast search against
the chicken genome. About 148 UTRs (136 from the CR1F and 12 from the CR1-B subfamilies) were identified and
used in the promoter analysis. Surprisingly, except for 15
UTRs (seven CR1-F and eight CR1-B), the vast majority of
CR1 5'UTRs (>90%) are found as short fragments (less
than half of the expected size) and are severely truncated
or mutated to varying degrees. Notably, most of the mutations or deletions occurred at putative transcription factor
binding sites as determined by TRANSFAC searches [21]

against the promoter sequences of the CR1 elements.
Unlike the functionally active CR1 sequences, these elements do not contain cis-acting elements or putative promoter-like sequences upstream of the start codon,
suggesting that the overwhelming majority of chicken
CR1 elements do not have the necessary functional promoter sequences for initiation of RNA transcription.
The 5'UTR of the potentially active CR1-B element is
approximately 240 bp long and contains two putative E
boxes, the cis-element for binding of the basic helix-loophelix family of proteins. E boxes have been noted as an
obvious feature of vertebrate CR1-elements [22]. In addition to the E boxes, other potential binding sites for C/
EBP, USF and Sp1 are also found in the promoter
sequence of CR1-B element (Figure 4B and Additional file
1, Table S4). Unlike other vertebrate CR1-elements such
as those in the turtle and puffer fish [22,23], there is no
obvious evidence of a 32-bp direct repeat sequence within
the CR1-B promoter sequence. Several deletions or insertions, ranging from several nucleotides to several dozen
nucleotides, were found in these regions of the CR1-B
direct repeats suggesting that this region might have
undergone frequent recombinational events. Direct repeat
sequences are often thought to be involved in dsRNA production, which are processed by Dicer into functional siRNAs. Interestingly, the 5'UTR sequence of CR1-F element
shows no resemblance to the 5'UTR of CR1-B elements.
Unlike the CR1-B element, there is no sequence corresponding to canonical E boxes (Figure 4C). Promoter
analysis of the CR1-F elements shows the presence of at
least three regions corresponding to the binding of Oct-1/
AP-1 (Fos/Jun activating protein-1) core elements within
the region of promoter. In addition, a potential binding
site for GR (glucocorticoid receptor) is also located at
upstream of the start codon. GR is a zinc-finger DNAbinding protein likely to be involved in the activation of
CR1-F elements through a Fos/Jun complex similar to that
found in the chicken vitellogenin and ovalbumin genes
[24]. This observation raises the possibility that cellular
transcription factors that bind to these genes might act in
concert to regulate the expression of CR1-F elements.
Sequence divergence of 5'UTR within each CR1 subfamily
The intact and functionally active CR1 elements identified
thus far belong to the CR1-B and CR1-F subfamilies. Our
study shows that the 5'UTR promoter sequence of B and F
elements are distinct and unrelated to each other, suggesting the existence of sequence diversity in the 5'UTR promoters in the chicken genome. The relationships among
the 5'UTRs of all other CR1 subfamilies (including the
previously described CR1 elements C, D, E, and H) are
poorly understood. To evaluate the biological significance
of all these CR1 promoters, we downloaded the 5'UTR
sequences of all CR1 subfamilies in the chicken genome

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/53

and aligned them using ClustalX (see Additional file 1,
Tables S2 and S3). Sequences that contained large truncations or deletions in the alignment of the 5'UTR
sequences were removed, resulting in a final set of 169
sequences that were used for the construction of a phylogenetic tree (Figure 5). The 5'UTRs of chicken CR1 elements cluster into six distinct subfamilies. The largest
group of 5'UTRs belongs to subfamilies D and G (with 75
and 51 elements, respectively) scattered throughout the
chicken genome. Except for a very few copies of B and F
subfamily members, none of the CR1 elements representing the C, D, G, and H subfamilies contain sequences that
might provide functionally active CR1 elements (data not
shown). This indicates that they are not retrotransposition
competent. The most notable finding that emerged from
our sequence analysis is that the 5'UTR sequence of the
functionally active CR1-F element has diverged from that
of the non-functional CR1-F elements (Additional file 1,
Table S5) indicating the existence of distinct promoter
sequences for functional elements within the CR1 subfamily of the chicken genome.
Functional CR1 elements are rare in the chicken genome
Next, we analysed whether the intact 5'UTR promoter
contains the genomic DNA sequence of full-length ORF1
and ORF2 sequences. For this analysis, the consensus protein sequence of ORF1 was initially used in a protein BLAT
search against the chicken genome. The regions that
showed similarity were isolated along with 6 kb of their
flanking sequences. In a second step, the resulting
genomic DNA sequences were screened for the presence
of an intact 5'UTR promoter. We identified only six fulllength CR1 elements with intact promoters (four belonging to the CR1-F subfamily and two to the CR1-B subfamily) that have a size of >4,200 bp; the others were
severely truncated at either the 5' or 3'region of ORFs. Out
of four CR1-F elements, three were found to contain intact
promoters capable of RNA transcription, but these elements are defective in the coding region of ORF1 and
ORF2 due to frame-shift mutations (see Additional file 1,
Table S6). Only one copy of the CR1-F element found on
chromosome 6 with an intact promoter (chr. 6: position
2161469 – 2166909) appears to be functionally active
with the ability to produce both ORF proteins. Its
sequences are also in agreement with previous report of a
functional 'mother' CR1 element [4]. Similarly, out of two
intact CR1-B elements, only one copy a of CR1-B element
with intact promoter and ORFs for both proteins was
found on chromosome 5 (position 5715277 – 5719735).
This element is 98% identical with the consensus
sequence of CR1-B (accession no. U88211), whereas the
other CR1-B element on chromosome 2 (51121971 –
51126431) was truncated at ORF1. Interestingly, two
additional CR1-B elements on chromosomes 5 and 2 contained intact ORF regions (Additional file 1, Table S6) but

these elements do not contain promoter sequences that
can serve as an initiation point for transcription. In summary, the overwhelming majority of chicken CR1 elements appear to be non-functional and thus unable to
replicate. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that there is at
least one copy of the CR1-F and B subfamily still potentially capable of active in the chicken genome.

Discussion
Silencing the activity of retrotransposable elements is
important for maintaining genomic integrity and stability
[25]. It is commonly thought that siRNAs derived from
repetitive elements can protect the genome against transposable elements. Supporting this notion, the first evidence in mammals [11] shows that siRNA derived from
both strands of active L1 sequences control expression of
L1 retrotransposons by Dicer-mediated RNAi silencing
pathways. It has also been shown that knocking down
Dicer expression in human cells can lead to a marked
increase in retrotransposition activity as well as accumulation of L1 transcripts, providing a direct link between the
RNAi machinery and suppression of transposable elements. A single copy of the Dicer gene is also present in
chicken and other vertebrates [26,27], although the biological functions of Dicer-mediated silencing pathways in
the chicken are not yet fully understood. Notably, until
now there has been no direct evidence of an involvement
of the chicken Dicer enzyme in controlling the activity of
endogenous chicken CR1 transposons.
In our current analysis, we evaluated the contribution of
the Dicer-mediated RNAi machinery to control of chicken
CR1 elements. In contrast to mammals, Dicer knockdown
in chicken cells did not result in increased expression of
endogenous CR1 elements. However, when we introduced transcriptionally active human L1 elements into
chicken cells in which Dicer expression was depleted, a
significant increase in the accumulation of L1 transcripts,
as well as retrotransposition, was observed. The ability of
chicken Dicer to perform RNAi silencing of mammalian
transposons but not chicken CR1 elements highlights a
major difference between the chicken CR1 and mammalian transposable elements. The response of chicken RNAi
machinery against exogenous L1s seems to be more subtle
than that of some other eukaryotes such as mouse, C. elegans and Drosophila, whose genomes can rapidly accumulate retrotransposon transcripts and acquire a mutator
phenotype through disruption of RNAi pathway [20,28].
This 'lying in wait' response of the chicken against human
L1 elements is reminiscent of the RNAi response against
the LINE-like Tad transposon in Neurospora [29,30]. Interestingly, like the chicken CR1 elements, most of the Tad
transposons are inactive in Neurospora due to mutation
and truncation. However, upon introduction of transcrip-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/53

tionally active Tad elements, siRNAs against Tad elements
are produced, prompting the activation of an RNAi-mediated silencing pathway. Thus, perhaps one role of the
RNAi machinery is to permit a rapid and potent response
to the sudden activation of L1 retrotransposons.
There are several possible explanations for our failure to
detect expression of endogenous CR1 transposons in
Dicer-deficient chicken cells. In one plausible model, we
considered the possibility that additional chicken Dicer
enzymes might be redundantly employed in CR1 transposon control pathways, similar to that seen in Neurospora in
which two Dicer enzymes are mutually able to control Tad
transposons [17]. Recent evidence from Drosophila and
Arabidopsis has also demonstrated that different Dicer
homologues can provide distinct substrate specificity
[31]. However, this does not seem to be the case in
chicken cells, which are known to contain a single copy of
Dicer on chromosome 5 [27]. In addition, Dicer deficiency in chicken DT40 cells has already been shown to
cause defects in heterochromatin formation and aberrant
accumulation of transcripts from α-satellite sequences
through disruption of RNAi-mediated silencing pathways
[15]. Moreover, our current data suggest that Dicer-deficient chicken cells retain their ability to control mammalian L1 retrotransposon expression.
Alternatively, as we see in mammals, activation of the
RNAi machinery may depend on initial transcription of
retrotransposons to produce dsRNAs, which serve as substrates for Dicer processing into siRNAs [11]. Surprisingly,
most of the chicken 5'UTRs (>90%) are found to be
severely truncated and mutated in the promoter regions of
CR1 elements; nonetheless, there remain a very few copies
of CR1-F and CR1-B elements still potentially capable of
retrotransposition. Our data show that except for one
copy of the CR1-F and CR1-B elements, almost none of
the chicken CR1s contain putative promoter-like
sequences upstream of the transcriptional start codon,
indicating that almost all chicken CR1 elements are not
functionally active. Only one functional CR1-F element
with an intact promoter sequence and ORFs for both proteins is found, on chromosome 6 (Repbase 2005) and is
flanked by 5-bp target site duplication. Similarly, only one
copy of the CR1-B element identical with the consensus
sequence of CR1-B (accession no. U88211) is found on
chromosome 5. This suggests that functionally active CR1
elements are very rare in the chicken genome. Of course,
it is possible that most of the CR1 elements have lost their
activity during the course of evolution and become nonfunctional. The drastic reduction of intact CR1 copies and
the lack of many active CR1 elements in the chicken
genome suggest that chicken CR1 elements may possibly
be approaching extinction.

Phylogenetic analysis of the 5'UTR promoters of all chicken
Phylogenetic analysis of the 5'UTR promoters of all
chicken CR1 subfamilies. The tree is constructed based
on sequence diversity of all 5'UTRs, including functional and
non-functional CR1 elements, using the neighbour-joining
method. Each CR1 subfamily is shown in different colours,
and CR1-F subfamily with more than one branch is shown in
the same (red) colour.
A recent study in mammalian oocytes suggests that
around 1,000 molecules of dsRNA are required to trigger
Dicer-mediated RNAi silencing pathways [32,33]. Production of such high levels of dsRNA is likely to correlate with
the level of RNA expression. Absence of large numbers of
functionally active CR1 promoters is probably one of the
reasons that even if a few copies of CR1-F and CR1-B do
function, they are not sufficient to trigger Dicer-mediated
silencing. Consistent with this, the present study shows
that the chicken CR1-B promoter is much weaker than
that of the human L1 promoter, by factor of sixfold. Interestingly, the evolution of CR1 in the chicken genome
seems to differ from that of L1 in mammals; unlike the
single L1 lineage in mammals, our analysis shows that the
chicken CR1 elements form six distinct subfamilies (CR1B, C, D, F, and H) that are considerably diverged from
each other in their 5'UTR regions. These results are also in
agreement with a previous report of the 5'UTR sequences
of chicken CR1-B and CR1-F elements [4,6]. Given the
low degree of sequence homology in the 5'UTRs of CR1
elements, if any siRNAs are produced from a single CR1
locus, they would not have the potential to target every
CR1 transcript for RNAi-mediated control. Indeed, our
data suggest that control of the activity of chicken CR1

It seems likely that the chicken has multiple mechanisms
to ensure suppression of CR1 silencing, similar to what is
seen in mouse oocytes in which retrotransposon silencing
is carried out by both siRNA and pi-interacting RNA
(piRNA) pathways [34]. One plausible mechanism is
Dicer-independent piRNAs. Unlike siRNAs, piRNAs do
not depend upon Dicer [7,35] and do not seem to be
derived from dsRNA precursors of active retrotransposons
[36]. Instead, they seem to arise from single-stranded
RNAs that are transcribed from piRNA clusters. The nuclease activity of the Piwi proteins (PIWI and Aubergine
orthologues) is required for piRNA processing. Recent
studies in mice and Drosophila showed that mutations in
Piwi proteins resulted in a loss of retrotransposon control
[35,37], suggesting a function for piRNAs in retrotransposon control. piRNAs are highly abundant in germ cells but
some evidence suggests that they are also active in somatic
tissues [38] and are involved in retrotransposon silencing
through chromatin modifications [13]. Given that piRNA
production is not dependent on either Dicer activity or
transcriptional activation of retrotransposons to produce
dsRNA precursors, it is plausible that silencing of CR1 elements in the chicken might primarily occur through
Dicer-independent piRNA pathways. An equally important possibility is cellular factors that can suppress the
expression of CR1 elements in the chicken genome. Further studies are required to provide the mechanistic support for CR1 silencing machinery.

Conclusion
The recent release of a chicken genome sequence revealed
that less than 9% of the chicken genome contains retrotransposable elements. It is not known whether the low
density of repetitive DNA elements in the chicken genome
is due to a lack of active elements or if chickens employ
small RNAi-mediated silencing pathways that control the
activity and copy numbers of transposable elements. We
analysed the loss of Dicer function on chicken endogenous CR1 elements with impaired RNAi machinery and
found that the control of chicken CR1 elements is independent of the Dicer-mediated RNAi silencing pathway.
In addition, our results strongly suggest that except for single copies of the CR1-F and CR1-B elements, almost none
of the chicken CR1 elements contain the necessary promoter sequences for initiation of RNA transcription. Phylogenetic analysis shows the existence of sequence
diversity at the 5'UTR promoters within each CR1 subfamily, indicating that they are not potential targets for
controlling the activity of every CR1 transcript by siRNA
pathway. Our results provide the first evidence that the

low level of repetitive elements in the chicken genome is
probably due to the absence of a large number of active
CR1 elements.

Methods
Gene targeting and cell culture
The chicken DT40 cell line containing a chicken Dicer
transgene under the control of a tet-repressible promoter
(Dicer-deficient/tet+; 2–49 cells) was a kind gift from Tatsuo Fukagawa (PRESTO of JST, Mishima, Japan). Detailed
descriptions of Dicer gene targeting and expression of
constructs are given in [15]. The Dicer-deficient DT40 cells
were maintained in PRMI 1640 (Gibco) with 2 mM Lglutamine, 10% fetal calf serum, 1% chicken serum, 50
μM β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mg/ml geneticin, 0.5 μg/ml
puromycin (Sigma), and 1 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitogen).
Expression of the tet-responsive Dicer transgene was suppressed by the addition of 2 μg/ml Dox (Sigma) to the culture medium.
Plasmids and transfection
The human L1 expression vector, pCMV-RP99-eGFP and
retrotransposition-defective vector, pCMV-ΔRP99-eGFP
were created by inserting a CMV promoter in frame
between NotI and SalI restriction sites of pRP99-EGFP and
pJM111-EGFP (obtained from HH Kazazian, University
of Pennsylvania). For transfection, exponentially growing
chicken DT40 cells (approximately 5 × 106) were harvested and electroporated with 15 μg of pCMV-99RPeGFP or pCMV-ΔRP99-eGFP at 250 V and 960 μF in a
Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) as described by Honda et al.
(2007) [39]. To examine the transfection efficiency in
chicken DT40 cells, pDsRed-N1 (Clontech) was used as a
reporter control. At 24 h after transfection, cells were
equally split and cultured in the presence or absence of 2
μg/ml Dox at the indicated times. GFP-positive cells were
analysed by sorting with a FACSVantage DiVa cell sorter
(Becton-Dickinson). Each experimental group was transfected in triplicate and repeated twice.
Retrotransposition assay
Genomic DNA was isolated from DT40 cells at 72 h after
addition of Dox or from control cells using QIAamp DNA
kit (Qiagen). PCR was carried out to examine the structure
of the EGFP reporter cassette integrated in this genomic
DNA with the Geno-5' and Geno-3' primers (see Additional file 1, Table S1). Amplifications were performed in
50 μl containing 1.25 U Taq polymerase, 2.5 mM MgCl2,
1× PCR buffer (Fermentas), 0.2 mM each dNTP, 5 μM of
each primer and 500 ng of genomic DNA or 5 ng of plasmid DNA template. After an initial step at 95°C for 5 min,
35 cycles of amplification were performed (95°C for 30 s,
58°C for 15 s and 72°C for 2 min), followed by a final
step at 72°C for 8 min. The amplified products were visualized on a 1.2% agarose gel. The genomic DNA of wildtype chicken DT40 cells was used as a negative control.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/53

Quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from the Dicer-deficient DT40
cells using an RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) and digested with TurboDNase-I (Ambion). A total of 2 μg of purified RNA was
used in cDNA synthesis with 0.1 μg of random decamer
primers using the RETROScript RT Kit (Ambion). The
resulting cDNAs (fivefold serial dilutions of cDNA; 100,
20, 5, 1 and 0.2 ng per reaction) were used as templates
for QPCR with the gene-specific primers (Additional file
1, Table S1). In this assay, performing cDNA synthesis in
the absence of reverse transcriptase served as negative controls. QPCR was performed by using SYBR Green PCR
master mix and 7900HT Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems) at typical amplification parameters (50°C for 2 min
and 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for
15 s and 60°C for 1 min). The fold differences were determined by comparing the ΔCT value of each gene normalized with the chicken β-actin as a reference control for
each reaction. Data generated was the average of three
independent experiments with each experiment performed in triplicate, and analysed using the Relative
Expression Software Tool (REST, version 2) [40].
Strand-specific RT-PCR analysis
One microgram of purified total RNA was reverse-transcribed with 2 μM of antisense-strand (internal) primers
(for targeting the sense message of transposons) and
SuperScriptase II (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Negative controls included carrying
out cDNA synthesis in the absence of reverse transcriptase
and primers. All the primer sequences used in this assay
are given in Additional file 1, Table S1. One microlitre of
the resulting cDNAs was used as template for subsequent
PCR analysis with the gene-specific primer sets. In these
assays, the chicken β-actin primer was used as a reference
control. The amplified products were visualized on a 2%
agarose gel. The intensity of the DNA bands was also
assessed with Gene-Snap software (Syngene, USA) following the manufacturer's instructions.
Small RNA isolation and northern blot
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen)
from control or Dicer-depleted chicken DT40 cells. About
100 μg of total RNA was subjected to enrichment of small
RNAs by adding 50% PEG-8000 and 5 M NaCl to a final
concentration of 5% and 0.5 M, respectively. The resulting
supernatant (that is, the small RNAs fraction) was precipitated by ethanol along with 2 μg glycogen (Promega) and
dissolved in 20 μl water. An equal amount of small RNA
sample was electrophoresed in a 15% urea-PAGE gel and
then transferred onto Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham
Pharmacia). L1 RNA probes were prepared by in vitro transcription using the Megascript T7 in vitro transcription kit
(Ambion) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
The resulting labelled dsRNA was hydrolysed to an average size of 50 nt by sodium bicarbonate treatments as

described by Nolan et al. [29]. RNA size markers were prepared from Decade Markers (Ambion) following the supplier's instructions and approximately one picomole of
radiolabelled size markers was loaded on a gel. For
chicken CR1 elements, a mixture of three sense-strand oligonucleotides, each 70 bp in size covering most of the
CR1-B 5'UTR region (see Additional file 1, Table S1), was
used as probe after end labelling with T4 polynucleotide
kinase (Fermentas). Hybridization and washing of the
northern blot were performed as described elsewhere
[29]. Signals were detected by exposure to PhosphorImager FLA-3000 system (Fuji, Tokyo) and density of the
signal was quantified by Fuji film's multi Gauge software.

subfamily were constructed based on multiple sequence
alignment and neighbour-joining trees using ClustalX.
The binding sites for transcription factors on each 5'UTR
CR1 subfamily were analysed using the MATCH programs
in the TRANSFAC 7.0 [20,44].

Luciferase assay
The 5'UTR of human L1 elements was amplified by PCR
from pRP99-EGFP and cloned into the reporter plasmid
pGL3 (Promega) upstream of the luciferase gene. A synthetic double strand DNA sequence covering the entire
region of 241 bp of the CR1-B 5'-UTR (chr. 5: position
5715277 – 5715518) was synthesized (Gene Work, Australia) and cloned into pGL3 at the SmaI site and confirmed by DNA sequencing. A Renilla luciferase vector,
pRL-CMV (Promega) was used to correct the transfection
efficiency. The chicken DT40 cells were cotransfected with
the modified pGL3 firefly luciferase (under the control of
either L1 5'UTR or CR1-B 5'UTR as a promoter) and the
Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid. Firefly and Renilla
luciferase assays were measured after 48 h in the presence
or absence of 2 μg/ml Dox with the Dual-Luciferase
Reporter assay system (Promega). Firefly activity was normalized to Renilla activity to control the transfection efficiency.

Authors' contributions

Western blot analysis
Total protein was extracted from the Dicer-deficient 2–49
cells using the M-PER reagent (Pierce). About 20 μg of
whole-cell extract was separated in a 10% SDS-PAGE gel,
transferred onto a Protran Nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and probed with anti-Dicer antibody,
DcR1 (1:500 dilution, Abcam) or anti-β-actin antibody,
clone AC-15 (1:4000 dilution, Sigma). The membrane
was then probed with secondary peroxidase-conjugated
anti-mouse (1:5000 dilution, Silenus) for 1 h and visualized with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences).
Computational analysis
For identification of the CR1 promoter sequences, the previously described repeat sequences of CR1 subfamilies
[4,6,41] were used as query sequences in DNA BLAT or
protein BLAT searches against sequences from the UCSC
chicken genome [42] and Gallus GBrowse [43]. The
sequences that aligned with the initial seed sequence were
grouped with it if they were at least 75% similar over 50%
of their length. The consensus sequences for each repeat
