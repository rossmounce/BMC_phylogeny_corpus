Background: In higher multicellular eukaryotes, complex protein domain combinations
contribute to various cellular functions such as regulation of intercellular or intracellular signaling
and interactions. To elucidate the characteristics and evolutionary mechanisms that underlie such
domain combinations, it is essential to examine the different types of domains and their
combinations among different groups of eukaryotes.

Protein domains are the basic building blocks that determine
the structure and function of proteins, and they may be considered the units of protein evolution. Furthermore, combinations of protein domains provide a broad spectrum for

potential protein function [1-4]. Eukaryotic genome sequencing projects have revealed complicated and varied domain
architectures [5]. In particular, the number of domains in a
protein sequence is greater in higher eukaryotes, which have
elaborate multicellular bodies. Sophisticated domain

Conclusion: Rapid emergence of animal-specific domains was observed in animals, contributing to
specific domain combinations and functional diversification, but no such trends were observed in
other clades of eukaryotes. We therefore suggest that the strategy for achieving complex
multicellular systems in animals differs from that of other eukaryotes.

Results: We observed a large number of group-specific domain combinations in animals, especially
in vertebrates. Examples include animal-specific combinations in tyrosine phosphorylation systems
and vertebrate-specific combinations in complement and coagulation cascades. These systems
apparently underwent extensive evolution in the ancestors of these groups. In extant animals,
especially in vertebrates, animal-specific domains have greater connectivity than do other domains
on average, and contribute to the varying number of combinations in each animal subgroup. In
other groups, the connectivities of older domains were greater on average. To observe the global
behavior of domain combinations during evolution, we traced the changes in domain combinations
among animals and fungi in a network analysis. Our results indicate that there is a correlation
between the differences in domain combinations among different phylogenetic groups and different
global behaviors.

combinations are thought to have contributed to complicated
multicellular functional systems, such as cell adhesion, cell
communication, and cell differentiation. Here we perform a
systematic survey of the eukaryotic genome sequence data
currently available to elucidate how domain combinations
evolved and how they are related to specific cellular functions
in eukaryotes.
It is already known that the number of combinations involving a particular domain is quite varied, and that the distribution of the number of combination partners follows a power
law distribution [6-10]. Preference for partner domains in
combination varies depending on the domain. Functionally
related genes frequently fuse and result in multidomain proteins that have multiple functions [11,12]. In addition, for the
three superkingdoms, namely eukaryotes, eubacteria, and
archaea, kingdom-specific domains tend to combine within
each other [6,7,9], and the domains that emerged later in
eukaryotes tend to have a large number of combination partners [8]. These observations are based on comparative analysis of extant eukaryotes or prokaryotes whose genomes have
been sequenced. With recent rapid progress in various
eukaryotic genome sequencing projects, comparative analysis
of the evolutionary relationships among phylogenetic groups
of eukaryotes, as opposed to among individual species, has
become possible. This allows more detailed examination of
the differences among specific domains and their combinations among phylogenetic groups of eukaryotes.
In this work, we focus on the relationship of domain combinations and functional diversification in eukaryotes, with
consideration of hierarchical classification based on their
phylogenies. We also explore how domains and their combinations are distributed and conserved in each group of
eukaryotes. In order to define specific domains and combinations for each phylogenetic group, we modified the method
developed by Mirkin and coworkers [13], which estimates
ortholog contents of ancestral species based on the most parsimonious method. The most parsimonious method is a commonly used approach to estimating ancestral ortholog
content [14-18].
Our analysis uncovers differences in specific domains and
their combinations among different phylogenetic groups of
eukaryotes. We observe a large number of animal-specific
and vertebrate-specific domain combinations. However,
those domains having a large number of combination partners are different in animals and vertebrates, and their functions are strongly linked to their characteristic functions that
evolved in the common ancestors of animals and vertebrates.
Examples include animal-specific combinations in tyrosine
phosphorylation systems and vertebrate-specific combinations in complement and coagulation cascades. In animals,
especially in vertebrates, the average connectivity of animalspecific domains is markedly high. In contrast, the older
domains tend to have greater average connectivity in other

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R121

groups of eukaryotes. These observations suggest that the
properties of domains are nonuniform in terms of generating
domain combinations.
Our findings also made it possible to reconstruct an evolutionary history of the domain combinations in each clade of
eukaryotes and to observe changes of combinations based on
a global network analysis. The global features of the reconstructed evolution of the network are consistent with the
observed differences in properties of group-specific domains.
Therefore, our analysis enables us to link local differences
among group-specific domains with the global features of
domain combination changes during evolution. From these
observations, it is suggested that the strategy for achieving
complex multicellular systems might be different, even
among eukaryotes, in terms of the preference for generation
of domain combinations.

Results
Assignment of domains and their combinations
We used the domains defined in the Pfam database [19]. Of
7,459 domains stored in its Pfam-A section (version 14.0),
4,315 were assigned to the protein sets of 47 eukaryotes,
including vertebrates, insects, worms, fungi, plants, and protists. Figure 1 summarizes the hierarchical classification of
these eukaryotes based on their phylogenetic relationships
and the number of domains found in them (Additional data
file 7 [Supplementary Table 1]). In almost all eukaryotic species, Pfam domains covered on average about 10% to 30% of
sequence length in each protein set. The coverage did not
greatly differ among phylogenetic groups, except for fungi,
which had slightly greater coverage. The average number of
domains in each protein in higher animals was generally
greater than those of other species.
Domain combinations can be defined in several ways, such as
by co-occurrence in a protein sequence. Here, in order to distinguish domain architectures possibly generated by individual evolutionary events, we defined a combination as two
consecutively located domains (Figure 2a). We also distinguished between combinations when the order of two
domains on a protein was inverted (Figure 2b). In total, 6,977
unique combinations were found in the 47 eukaryote protein
sets (Figure 1). The number of domain combinations found in
multicellular animals was large (>800), as well as in the multicellular fungi (Neurospora crassa and Magnaporthe grisea), land plants (Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa),
and Dictyostelium discoideum (about 700 to 1,500). It should
be noted that species with a large number of proteins do not
always have a large number of domain combinations; for
instance, Entamoeba histolytica and Trypanosoma cruzi
have large numbers of proteins and few combinations.

Estimation of group-specific domains and
combinations

We next identified group-specific domains for each group of
eukaryotes, where 47 eukaryotes were divided into 14 groups.
We classified the groups hierarchically, based on their

information

We first identified eukaryote-specific domains in the set of
4,315 domains found in 47 eukaryotes, among which 2,065
domains were also found in prokaryotes. Even if a domain is
found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, it may still be considered a eukaryote-specific domain in the case of horizontal
transfer from eukaryotes to prokaryotes. In order to discriminate those domains that presumably existed in the commonote, the common ancestor of eukaryotes and

prokaryotes, we reconstructed the most parsimonious scenario of gains and losses of domains during prokaryotic evolution using the method proposed by Mirkin and coworkers
[13]. As a result, 1,211 domains were assigned to the commonote (shown as shared by prokaryotes in Figure 3), and
3,104 domains were considered to be eukaryote specific.

We then examined group-specific domain combinations. In
contrast to the case of group-specific domains, a group-specific combination cannot be defined by simply tracing the last
common ancestor because identical combinations can arise
independently in different groups. We again used the method
proposed by Mirkin and coworkers [13] to reconstruct the
most parsimonious scenario and estimated that only 128
combinations were generated in multiple groups. In Figure 3,
we show the number of group-specific combinations in the
major eukaryote groups (also see Additional data file 7 [Supplementary Table 2]). In animals and deuterostomes, the
numbers of group-specific domain combinations were large,
at 875 and 610, respectively, in addition to the large numbers
of group-specific domains themselves. On the other hand, the
number of combinations specific to land plants was small
compared with the number of specific domains.

represented as a network. A domain corresponds to a node, and edges
refer to the co-occurrence or combination of a domain in the protein set
under consideration. In a domain co-occurrence network, two domains
are connected by an edge if they co-occurred in the same protein
sequence. Here, we considered a domain combination network in which
two domains must be located consecutively. Domain B is located between

phylogenetic relationships (for further details, see Additional
data file 1). We considered two additional groups, namely
deuterostomes (vertebrates plus ascidian) and opisthokonta
(animals plus fungi), in the hierarchical classification.
Because horizontal gene transfer among eukaryotes can be
disregarded [14,15,20], we assigned the domain to the ancestral group when derived groups and species possess the
domain. Among 3,104 domains in eukaryotes, 1,439 domains
were shared in all eukaryotes, but the rest were group specific
(Figure 3). We observed greater numbers of group-specific

Characterization of animal- and deuterostome-specific
domain combinations
Here we focus on the domains forming these animal-specific
or deuterostome-specific combinations. The 875 animal-specific combinations consist of 558 domains, and the 610 deuterostome-specific combinations consist of 478 domains.
Among them, 72 domains in animal-specific combinations
and 50 domains in deuterostome-specific combinations have
more than five partner domains, which we call hub domains.
Although 36 domains were commonly found in both groups,
the hub domains tend to have preferentially large numbers of
combination partners in each group. For example, the protein
kinase domain (Pfam ID: Pkinase) was found in 37 animalspecific combinations but only in eight deuterostome-specific
combinations. In Tables 1 and 2 we list the hub domains that
were preferentially found in animal-specific or deuterostomespecific combinations, respectively.
These hub domains in group-specific combinations are presumably involved in different functions that have evolved in
the common ancestors of respective groups. In animal-specific combinations, the protein kinase domain (Pkinase) was
found to have the greatest number of partners. Other hub
domains in animal-specific combinations include the SH2
domain, the protein-tyrosine phosphatase domain
(Y_phosphatase), and the phosphotyrosine interaction
domain (PID), which are all related to tyrosine phosphorylation signaling (Table 1) [21-24].

We consider two additional phylogenetic groups: *Deuterostomes and **Opisthokonta. Some eukaryote genome sequences are still in draft and the
number of proteins was smaller than estimated (such as C. familiaris). However, our method to define group specificity using the multifurcated phylogenetic
tree can reduce effects of incompleteness of genome sequences. Additional information is provided in Additional data file 7 (Supplementary Table 2).

domain is shared by prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

On the other hand, domains involved in the complement and
blood coagulation cascade were frequently found in deuterostome-specific combinations (Table 2). In the complement
and blood coagulation cascade, the trypsin-like serine protease domain plays an important role, and the cascade is distributed among species in deuterostomes. We observed the
trypsin-like serine protease domain (Trypsin) and its inhibitors (TIL, Kazal_1, Kazal_2, and Kunitz_BPTI) as hub
domains in deuterostome-specific combinations. Furthermore, other domains involved in the cascade, such as von
Willebrand factor type A domain (VWA), Lectin (lectin_C),
F5/8 type C domain (F5_F8_type_C), and kringle domain,
were also hub domains in deuterostome-specific
combinations.

Group-specificity and connectivity of domains
Figure 3 shows the numbers of group-specific combinations,
including 875 animal-specific and 610 deuterostome-specific
combinations, in the hierarchical classification of phylogenetic groups. To inspect contributing factors for generating
large numbers of domain combinations during the course of
evolution, we examined the number of combination partners
of group-specific domains plotted against the hierarchy of
phylogenetic groups (Figure 4). The average number of combination partners is plotted for individual species in the
groups of deuterostomes, plants, invertebrates, fungi, and
protists. First, as shown in the figure, different species within
each group exhibited similar variations. Second, the nonanimal groups (plants, fungi, and protists) exhibited decreasing
partners along the hierarchy, indicating that the average

Shown are hub domains preferentially found in deuterostome-specific combinations. We defined hub domains that are preferentially found in
deuterostome-specific combinations as those found in deuterostome-specific combinations more than twice as frequently as in animal-specific
combinations. Regarding the group specificity of the domains, the terms 'Euk', 'Ani', and 'Deu' refer to eukaryote, animal, and deuterostome,

Using this procedure we traced the changes of the Î³ value

combination partners (the degree of a node). The degree distributions of combination networks of all domains in Homo
sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, A. thaliana, and T. cruzi
are shown in Figure 5a, and the values of Î³ for all species are
shown as a bold line in Figure 5b (also see Additional data file

the Î³ values varied among major groups of eukaryotes. From
possible domain combinations of ancestral species estimated
using the method of Mirkin and coworkers [13], the degree
distributions can be obtained for ancestral species. Figure 5a
shows such distributions for the common ancestor of animals
and that of opisthokonta (animals plus fungi).

number of combination partners of older domains is generally higher than that of new domains. Third, the animal
groups (deuterostomes and invertebrates) exhibited characteristic variation patterns. The average number of combination partners of animal-specific domains is much higher in
animals, especially in deuterostomes. On the other hand, the
number of partners of deuterostome-specific domains is
small, despite the large number of deuterostome-specific
combinations. These observations indicate that the animalspecific domains (not the deuterostome-specific domains)
largely contributed to the emergence of new group-specific
combinations in deuterostomes or invertebrates.

The average number of combination partners of group-specific domains. This figure illustrates the difference in the number of combination partners among
each group-specific domain in extant species. Each line shows average number of combination partners of group-specific domains in extant species in
deuterostomes, invertebrates, fungi, plants, and protists. Euk, Ani, Opi, Deu, Pla, Fun, Lan, Alg, Ins, and Nem refer to eukaryote, animal, opisthokonta,

include domains specific to respective subgroups of them because these numbers are very small. Species* in the graph of Protists refers to each group of
protists such as alveolata and euglenozoa. The outlier in Deuterostomes (C. familiaris) reflects the incompleteness of its its genome sequence, and the
difference among distributions for three plants reflect their distant evolutionary relationship. The hierarchical classification of groups and the numbers of

age of S. cerevisiae the Î³ value gradually increased. In order
to examine this difference, we defined the union domain combination network in each lineage of H. sapiens and S. cerevisiae. All nodes and all edges were accumulated in the union
network along the phylogenetic hierarchy without considering the loss of domains or combinations. The Î³ values for the
union networks are shown in dashed lines in Figure 5c, indicating a much greater decrease for the lineage of S. cerevisiae.
Similar analyses were performed for all other lineages and the
result is indicated by the dashed line in Figure 5b. Fungi and
protists apparently exhibit a large decrease in Î³ value in the
union network, probably reflecting a large number of gene
losses.

Discussion
Specific domain combinations in animals and
deuterostomes
Using the 47 eukaryotic genomes now available, we were able
to analyze protein domains and their combinations that are
specific to different phylogenetic groups of eukaryotes. The
number of domains per protein increased in higher multicellular species, especially in animals (Figure 1). We also
observed large numbers of animal-specific or deuterostomespecific domain combinations (Figure 3). These observations
indicate a rapid increase in complexity in domain architecture, which is termed 'domain accretion' [5].
Analyzing the hub domains in these group-specific combinations, we found that domain architectures became more complex within the systems that rapidly evolved in the common

that the emergence of highly connected animal-specific
domains was essential for the evolution of animals. In
contrast, there are no highly connected domains in other multicellular species such as land plants and multicellular fungi,
although they actually have a large number of domain combinations. Therefore, in nonanimal multicellular eukaryotes, an
increase in complexity of domain architecture did not depend
on new group-specific domains. However, the number of
sequenced plant and multicellular fungi genomes is still very
small, and further analysis taking phylogenetic relationships
into consideration will refine our observations.

90 million years ago); VI, human-chimpanzee (6 to 7 million years ago); VII, extant human [33-36]. Unexpectedly, the periods between divergence points

In contrast, in the deuterostome-specific combinations, we

blood coagulation cascade, which is commonly known as a
deuterostome-specific innate immune system involving serine protease [28,29]. Note that invertebrates, such as arthropods, also have an independently evolved innate immune
system that involves serine protease, but its molecular mechanism is different from that of deuterostomes [30,31].

categorized separately in newer versions of Pfam because of
increased knowledge regarding that domain. Because group
specificity of the Pfam domains is affected by these subfamily
classifications, this granularity may have affected our results.
Therefore, we examined the consistency of our results by
using different definitions of domains in which we hierarchically classified eukaryote-specific Pfam domains into more
granular subfamilies (see Materials and methods, below).
Table 3 shows the number of each group-specific subfamily of
eukaryote-specific domains as well as combination partners
that are unique to each group-specific subfamily. As shown
here, the increase in unique combination partners of eukaryote-specific domains also occurred after the divergence of
animal-specific subfamilies. In the other direction, we also
examined lax definitions of domains by merging Pfam
domains according to evolutionary relationships based on
Pfam Clans [19] and all trends were conserved (data not
shown). From these observations, we claim that our results
do not depend on the granularity of the domains.
For completeness, we further analyzed the affect of the definition of the domain combination networks on our results. In
related work, domain combination networks were simply
defined as the co-occurrence of two domains in a protein
sequence without considering domain order. Using this definition, all trends in our results were conserved (data not
shown).

Comparison with previous findings on the connectivity
of domains
Wuchty [8] indicated that the connectivity of domains did not
correlate with their age and that domains with high connectivity emerged late in eukaryote evolution. These
observations were based only on results from a comparison of
prokaryotes, S. cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster. Therefore, the results indicating high
connectivity in late eukaryotes could not be generally
claimed; high connectivity was actually found mostly in animals, and not necessarily in fungi and plants. In animals, we
also found that the animal-specific domains have very high
connectivity, which correlated well with their work. However,
when considering group-specific domains in nonanimal

groups, we observed a correlation between connectivity and
age, in which the oldest domains inherited from the commonote had the greatest connectivity among nonanimal
eukaryotes (Figure 4). Note that we computed connectivity
based on the average domain connectivity for each age. That
is, although in principle older domains had more combination partners, domain combinations differed depending on
domain or clade identity, and as a result we could obtain these
correlations between connectivity and age.

Linking molecular analysis and network analysis
By tracing and comparing the changes of domain combination networks together with the phylogenetic relationships
between eukaryotes, we observed differences in the evolution
of the combination networks in H. sapiens and S. cerevisiae
(Figure 5c). In the H. sapiens lineage, the Î³ value decreased
after the divergence of animals from fungi. Evolutionary analysis using molecular clock and fossil data suggests that the
period between animal-fungi divergence and deuterostomeinvertebrate (insects plus nematoda) divergence was about
300 million years, and that the lengths of the periods differed
little from each other [33-36] (see the legend to Figure 5c). It
is therefore suggested that the decrease of the Î³ value
occurred rapidly. Such growth concurrent with the decrease
of Î³ is called accelerated growth, which is a general and widespread feature of growing networks [37,38]. Accelerated network growth during animal evolution is due to the high
connectivity of animal-specific domains.
In the S. cerevisiae lineage, the Î³ value of the domain combination network increased, whereas that of the union network
decreased. These observations suggest that there were more
complicated domain networks in the ancestral species of
fungi, and gene loss strongly affected network evolution in the
S. cerevisiae lineage. In our dataset, most fungi are unicellular yeasts, and it is suggested that the size of the yeast
genomes diminished by gene loss events during evolution
[39]. Similarly, the difference between the Î³ value of domain
networks and that of union networks in protists was large,
which can also be explained by gene loss events. Many of the
protists are parasitic, and it is suggested that they have come
to depend on their hosts, in the process losing a number of
genes [40-43].

Proteins, domains, and phylogenetic relationship

Although it is commonly believed that a new gene emerges
only once in a single lineage during evolution, genes can also
be gained through horizontal gene transfer [58]. Mirkin and
coworkers [13] developed an algorithm to estimate the most
parsimonious scenario by taking into consideration horizontal gene transfer and the differences in frequency between
gene gains and gene losses. Their method computes the scenario with the smallest number of events, taking into consideration the difference in frequency between ortholog gains
and losses.

The most parsimonious scenario with multifurcated
trees

deposited research

Comparison of group specificities of domains and their combinations in different phylogenetic groups of eukaryotes
revealed nonuniform properties that could be strongly correlated with the characteristics and evolution of the respective
groups. In plants, fungi, and protists, more ancestral domains
tend to be reused as hub domains, but the domains that
emerged early in animals tend to have large numbers of combination partners. These domain combinations apparently
contributed to the functional diversification of animals,
including the tyrosine phosphorylation signaling and the
coagulation cascades. The distinction of animal and nonanimal groups also helps reconcile two previously reported conflicting views on preferential attachment in the evolution
model for the domain combination network.

To define specific domains and combinations for each clade of
eukaryotes that are hierarchically classified (Figure 1), we
consider the most parsimonious scenario of gains and losses
of domains and their combinations by considering phylogenetic trees for eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Because of the
uncertainty of some phylogenetic relationships and the low
coverage rate of the draft genomes, we used multifurcated
trees. We inferred a multifurcated consensus tree among 47
eukaryotes based on the recent view of eukaryotic evolution
[56,57] as shown in Additional data file 1. On the other hand,
there was no clear consensus regarding the relationships
among prokaryotes. Therefore, the phylogenetic tree for
prokaryotes was inferred from 16S ribosomal RNA sequences
and was arranged as a multifurcated tree.

the HMMER assignments for proteins obtained from KEGG

reviews

Our findings indicate that the changes in domain combinations differed between periods of evolution as well as among
phylogenetic groups, implying that the evolutionary driving
force for domain combination generation changed during
eukaryotic evolution. Therefore we claim that simple comparison of extant species using a uniform model is insufficient in
this case. Consequently, individual species lineages, periods
of evolution, and differences in domain propensity for generating combinations must all be taken into consideration.

comment

To describe the scale-free behavior and evolutionary mechanisms of various biologic networks, evolutionary models have
often been studied [44-48]. The simplest of these models is
the preferential attachment model [49], in which new nodes
link to an existing node with a probability proportional to its
degree. In this model, older nodes have greater connectivity,
and the degree distribution is conserved during network
growth. However, our results show that the degree
distributions were not conserved during evolution because of
the accelerated growth in animals and the diminished
genome in fungi. Moreover, the connectivity of animal-specific domains was very high (although, in nonanimal groups,
average connectivity could be correlated with the age of specific domains). This apparent disagreement is supported by
findings reported by Przytycka and coworkers [50,51]; they
found the topologic structure of the observed co-occurrence
network of real biological data was to be different from synthetically generated random scale-free networks constructed
according to the preferential attachment model.

Estimation of the most parsimonious scenario of evolution in a multifurcated tree
Estimation of the most parsimonious scenario of evolution in a multifurcated tree. (a) At internal nodes having more than two children, we insert two
tentative nodes, Ïi and Ïn. We assume that children of Ïi (Ïn) always (do not) inherit the target gene from Ïi (Ïn). (b) Description of our modification for
multifurcated branching (see Materials and methods). (c) It is assumed that the gene is lost in Ïn when the gene is inherited from v. (d) It is assumed that
the gene is gained in Ïi when the gene is not inherited from v.

In step 3, graft the child c in Ci to Ïi and graft the child c in Cn
to Ïn. In step 4, consider two cases - Ïi and Ïn inherit the gene
(Figure 6c) and Ïi and Ïn do not inherit the gene (Figure 6d) and count the events for Ïi and Ïn. In step 5, apply the method
of Mirkin and coworkers [13] to bifurcated branching at v
with children Ïi and Ïn.
If the tentative nodes Ïi and Ïn inherit a gene from internal
node v, then the smallest number of events is satisfied when
the gene is lost in Ïn; this is because the numbers of events for
children ci become smaller when the gene is inherited from
their parent Ïi, and those for children cn become smaller when
the gene is lost in their parent Ïn and not inherited from Ïn
(Figure 6c). If Ïi and Ïn do not inherit the gene from v, then the
smallest number of events is satisfied when the gene is gained

in Ïi (Figure 6d). Any phylogenetic relationships within nodes
in Ci or within Cn do not affect the smallest number of events
because no event should occur among them.

Domains inherited from the commonote
Domains existing in eukaryotes include domains inherited
from the commonote, which is the common ancestor of
eukaryotes, eubacteria, and archaea. Horizontal gene transfer
often occurred from eukaryotes to prokaryotes, and hence it
may not necessarily be true that a domain emerged in the
commonotes, even if the domain is contained in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. So we estimated the most parsimonious
scenario of domain gains and losses in prokaryotes with the
method described above, to find domains inherited from the
commonote. As a result, domains in eukaryotes that existed

in the common ancestor of eubacteria or the common ancestor of archaea were estimated, and we assume that these
domains were inherited from the commonote to eukaryotes.

Identical domain combinations may have been independently generated in multiple clades. Thus, we estimate the parsimonious scenario with the method in the previous section
by using the consensus tree of eukaryotes. Then, as in the case
of specific domains, we defined a combination as being specific for the clade rooted at the common ancestor in which the
combination was generated.

Horizontal gene transfer between major clades of eukaryotes
can be disregarded [14,15,20]. Thus, the most parsimonious
scenario is that a domain emerged in the last common
ancestor of the existing species having proteins with the
domain and only gene loss followed. We defined that the
domain be specific for the clade rooted at the common
ancestor.

Estimation of specific subfamilies

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R121

S ( x ) := {sd | d â leaves(TxDomain )}.

information

Domain subfamily emergence was defined according to the
species included in the subtree of the dendrogram obtained
from hierarchical clustering of the domain sequences. To construct multiple alignments of each domain, we extracted
sequences corresponding to the domain defined by a hidden
Markov model profile in Pfam and aligned them to the profile
by using HMMalign in the HMMER package. After eliminating insertions not aligned to the profiles, we carried out hier-

Domains can be classified by hierarchical clustering based on
sequence similarity. However, it is impossible to define a general threshold of sequence similarity to divide subfamilies for
various domains. Thus, taking into account the generally
accepted assumption that subfamilies were created by duplication of paralogs, we comprehensively and automatically
defined subfamilies of Pfam domains by considering paralogous duplications of the domains based on the hierarchical
clustering of domain sequences. Comparing the phylogenetic
tree of eukaryotes TSpecies and the dendrogram TDomain
obtained by hierarchical clustering, we systematically defined
the emergence of subfamilies of the respective domains. Each
leaf d of the tree TDomain represents a domain sequence of a
species sd. Let S(x) be a set of such species for all leaves of a
subtree Tx Domain rooted at x as follows (also see Figure 7a):

To reduce the effect of noise in the data, we calculated the
cumulative distribution of the degrees in each domain combination network. The cumulative distribution of the power law
distribution also follows a power law, but with a different
exponent. When the exponent of the original distribution is Î³,
the exponent for the cumulative distribution becomes Î³ - 1
[59]. Thus, we obtained Î³ by least squares fitting of the cumulative distribution.

Alternative definition of domains
Alternative definition of domains. (a) Dendrogram of domains. S(x) was
defined as a set of species whose domains are included in the leaves
rooted at x. (b) Example of orthologous branching where S(c1) is a set of
mammals and S(c2) is a set of fishes. The divergence at v can be correlated
with the divergence of mammals and fishes. (c) Examples of paralogous
branching. In the upper case, where S(c1) is a set of mammals and S(c2) is a
set of vertebrates, it can be considered that domains are duplicated in
mammals but not in other vertebrates. We ignored serial duplication such
as in the bottom case.

Frequencies of gene gains and losses are not the same, and we
assume that gene losses occurred more frequently than gene
gains. It is crucial for parsimonious estimation to assess the
ratio of the frequency of losses to gains, and this ratio is
referred to as 'gain penalty' in the method proposed by Mirkin
and coworkers [13]. We implemented the gain penalty in the
same way. The ratio is not the same for individual genes and
domains, and hence it is difficult to estimate these values, but
we found that this was not essential for the present work
because all tendencies were found to be conserved when we
tested values between 1 and 3. Here, we show the results when
the gain penalty was set to 3 for all domains and
combinations.

Then, a branch at an internal node v on the dendrogram can
be one of the following two types, namely orthologous
branching by the divergence of species

where c1 and c2 are the children of v (Figure 7b,c). Here, we
defined subfamilies as having diverged with gene duplication,
and we only considered the first duplication if serial duplications occurred more than once in the same ancestral species.
Therefore, we extracted the internal nodes v at paralogous
branches satisfying the following condition:
lca(S(c2), TSpecies) â ancestors(c1, TSpecies)
Where lca(S, TSpecies) denotes the last common ancestor of a
set of species S, and ancestors(s, TSpecies) denotes the set of all
nodes in the path from the root to the parent of node s in the
phylogenetic tree TSpecies (all ancestral species at each branch
of the clade to species s in evolution). Then, the time when the
subfamily diverged was estimated to be lca(S(c1), TSpecies).
Because the domain sequences were hierarchically classified,
subfamilies were defined hierarchically.
