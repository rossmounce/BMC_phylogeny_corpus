Background
The apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is an
obligate intracellular human pathogen causing toxoplasmosis predominantly in immune-compromised hosts
such as cancer and transplant patients as well as
patients with AIDS [1]. A specific cGMP-dependent
protein kinase (TgPKG) which appears to be crucial for
host invasion has been identified in T. gondii and related
coccidial protozoa [2]. However, detailed structural and
biochemical analyses have been hampered due to the
inability to functionally express these kinases in high
yields in systems other than their parasite host
organisms.
Results
Here we describe the expression, purification and initial
characterization of the 911 amino acid (103 kDa) Histagged type II isoform of TgPKG using a bacterial
source. A phylogenetic analysis further reveals that
TgPKG2 belongs to an evolutionarily distinct sub-group
of the AGC-kinase family. The overall domain composition of TgPKG2 substantially deviates from its mammalian cousins at two regions. First, the 196 amino acid Nterminal/auto-inhibitory domain bears no resemblance
with any other PKG subfamily, and secondly the kinase
consists of three cGMP binding sites with the third
binding sites separated from the others by 135 amino
acids. Consequently, TgPKG2 illustrated a remarkable
level of cooperativity (nH = 2.9) accompanied by a 200400 fold cGMP-mediated activation utilizing the common PKG substrate TQAKRKKSLAMA (Km = 9 µM).

The associated activation constant was 1.7 µM which is
in full agreement with the isoforms obtained from T.
gondii parasite extract [3]. Interestingly, TgPKG2 was
completely insensitive to cAMP (K a » 100 µM).
Recently, the trisubstituted pyrrole 4-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-(1-methylpiperidine-4-yl)-1H pyrrol-3-yl] pyridine
(Compound 1) was shown to exhibit anticoccidial kinase
activity [3,4]. Compound 1 blocked kinase activity of
TgPKG2 with high potency (IC50 = 59 nM) and high
selectivity; the mammalian type Ia PKG showed an
approximately 1000-fold reduced IC50 of 45 µM.

Conclusion
This work demonstrates the first catalytically active
expression of any cGMP-dependent protein kinase from
E. coli and may provide a new platform for the functional and structural analysis, as well as evolutionary history, of PKG isoforms from apicomplexan parasites.
