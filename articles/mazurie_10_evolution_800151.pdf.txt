Abstract
Background: Comparison of metabolic networks across species is a key to understanding how evolutionary pressures
shape these networks. By selecting taxa representative of different lineages or lifestyles and using a comprehensive set
of descriptors of the structure and complexity of their metabolic networks, one can highlight both qualitative and
quantitative differences in the metabolic organization of species subject to distinct evolutionary paths or
environmental constraints.
Results: We used a novel representation of metabolic networks, termed network of interacting pathways or NIP, to
focus on the modular, high-level organization of the metabolic capabilities of the cell. Using machine learning
techniques we identified the most relevant aspects of cellular organization that change under evolutionary pressures.
We considered the transitions from prokarya to eukarya (with a focus on the transitions among the archaea, bacteria
and eukarya), from unicellular to multicellular eukarya, from free living to host-associated bacteria, from anaerobic to
aerobic, as well as the acquisition of cell motility or growth in an environment of various levels of salinity or
temperature. Intuitively, we expect organisms with more complex lifestyles to have more complex and robust
metabolic networks. Here we demonstrate for the first time that such organisms are not only characterized by larger,
denser networks of metabolic pathways but also have more efficiently organized cross communications, as revealed by
subtle changes in network topology. These changes are unevenly distributed among metabolic pathways, with
specific categories of pathways being promoted to more central locations as an answer to environmental constraints.
Conclusions: Combining methods from graph theory and machine learning, we have shown here that evolutionary
pressures not only affects gene and protein sequences, but also specific details of the complex wiring of functional
modules in the cell. This approach allows the identification and quantification of those changes, and provides an
overview of the evolution of intracellular systems.
Background
Networks are commonly used in biology to represent
molecular mechanisms occurring in the cell, from protein-protein interactions to enzymatic reactions (metabolic networks) and gene regulations (gene regulatory
networks). The use of tools derived from graph theory
has led to the successful characterization of some aspects
of the topology and organization of these networks and
the intracellular mechanisms they represent. The study of
intracellular networks so far has revealed their smallworldness [1] and scale-freeness [2], as well as the existence of network motifs, [3,4] and a strongly modular
organization [5-8]-see Barabasi et al. [9] for a review.
Network representations are also increasingly used to

characterize the function of the objects (genes, proteins,
metabolites) they interconnect. This has lead to applications such as inference of functional annotation [10] or
predictions of new disease-related or longevity-related
genes [11,12]-see Aittokallio et al. [13] for a review.
Networks are also used in comparative studies to highlight the differences and similarities existing in the organization of the intracellular mechanisms of multiple
species. Studies have been published that compare the
topological features of metabolic networks for taxa sampled from all three kingdoms of life [14-17]. These investigations shed light on how these metabolic networks
differ among the archaea, bacteria and eukarya, as a
result of natural selection processes [18]. The results
show that while some properties are shared by all taxa
(e.g., their metabolic networks are all scale-free), bacteria
species distinguish themselves over archaea and eukarya
by having a shorter network average path length [15,16].

Metabolic networks of archaea species also exhibit a
lower average clustering coefficient, betweenness centrality and scale-freeness [17] than those of other species.
Finally, the organization of the metabolism of species
appears to be impacted by the species lifestyle and phenotype; e.g., by the variability of their habitat [19], or their
optimal growth temperature [20]. Metabolic networks of
modern organisms have also been compared to inferred
ancestral ones [21]. These studies indicate that niche specialization and extreme environments tend to decrease
the modularity of the metabolic networks of taxa.
A comparison of intracellular networks on the basis of
their topological similarity is thus a promising approach
to study the evolution of species. It complements comparative genomics strategies that focus on comparison of
gene sequence and genome architecture. However, while
metabolic networks are a useful representation of the
metabolic capabilities of the cell, they are of low organizational level, i.e., at the level of individual enzymatic
reactions. We propose here to proceed from higher-level
organizational principles of cell metabolism, and determine how these principles change under evolutionary
pressures.

Results and Discussion
Comparison of metabolism organization

Proceeding from publicly available annotations, different
groups of taxa were selected for this study as representative of environments or lineages of particular evolutionary interest. Hence, the organization of the metabolism of
taxa from the three kingdoms archaea, bacteria and
eukarya was compared, with an additional comparison of
the superkingdom prokarya and the kingdom eukarya.
Unicellular eukarya were opposed to multicellular
eukarya to reveal how the more stable environment and
cellular differentiation that a multicellular body implies
impacted the organization of metabolism. Free-living
bacteria were compared to host-associated bacteria, as
taxa from the latter group typically inhabit less demanding environments-the host providing most nutrients,
while limiting competitors and predators. Immotile bacteria were compared to motile ones, motility being a key
competitive advantage allowing an active search for
nutrients and evasion from predators or harmful environments. Aerobic bacteria were compared to anaerobes
and to facultative aerobic bacteria as a potential negative
control; in Raymond et al. [22], the authors demonstrated
that aerobic metabolism had little impact on the rewiring
of metabolic network structure during evolution,
although network size was affected. Finally, bacteria living in environments of distinct salinity (halophiles versus
halotolerants) and temperature (mesophiles versus psychrophiles and thermophiles) were compared, to assess
any large-scale adaptation of their metabolic network to

these environments. Each group of taxa was thus selected
for being a result of evolutionary pressures, and opposed
to other groups either lacking their most prominent characteristics, or subject to distinct evolutionary pressures.
Networks of interacting pathways (NIPs) were constructed to represent the high-level organization of cellular metabolism in all taxa as described in Mazurie et al.
[23], using the latest version of the KEGG metabolic reactions database [24]. Then, for all taxa group comparisons
considered, classification models were built to assess the
effectiveness of a comprehensive set of 52 quantitative
descriptors of the structure and complexity of NIPs in
distinguishing the groups. Briefly, classification models
were trained to predict the group to which a taxon
belongs solely from the values of its NIP descriptors.
Good predictions, as assessed by the accuracy and Kappa
statistics of 10-fold cross-validation, would indicate that a
sufficiently large difference exists between the NIPs of the
different taxa groups to allow an accurate classification.
Results are shown on Table 1.
The high scores obtained for most of the taxa group
comparisons confirm that distinct evolutionary pressures
are reflected by distinct organizational principles of the
metabolism of species. Our results confirm the finding
from Raymond et al. [22] showing a lack of significant differences between metabolic networks of aerobic versus
anaerobic species. We also show that no distinction could
be made between bacteria living in an environment of
distinct salinity or distinct temperature, based on the
topology of their NIPs. In the first case, this could be
explained by a lack of representative taxa for halotolerant
bacteria (only 4, compared to 15 halophiles). In the second case, the large number of representative taxa suggests a genuine absence of significant differences in the
structure and complexity of NIPs of psycrophilic, mesophilic and thermophilic bacteria.
Significant changes of metabolism organization

We first investigated the differences in the structure and
complexity of the NIPs of species from different lineages
or environments. Among the 52 NIP descriptors used for
this investigation, we identified using feature selection
algorithms (see Methods) the smallest subsets of descriptors that best discriminate taxa. The scores obtained are
reported in Table 1. A list of these best discriminating
descriptors of metabolic organization, as well as the average value obtained for each group of taxa, is given in Figure 1; values for all descriptors are provided as Additional
file 1.
Prokarya versus eukarya

The transition from archaea and bacteria to eukarya is
associated with an increase in the NIP size as revealed by
the network radius, diameter, and the average distance
between pathways. The weighted edge and vertex

Scores obtained by training classification models to discriminate groups of taxa based on quantitative descriptors of the structure and
complexity of their Networks of Interacting Pathways (NIPs). Data given is the number of taxa considered for each group, as well as the
accuracy and Kappa statistics on 10-fold cross-validation of the best performing classification model when using all 52 NIP descriptors and, in
parentheses, those obtained with the best subsets of descriptors identified (see Figure 1).

betweenness centrality (fraction of all metabolic
exchanges going through a pathway) also increase, revealing not just larger but also more efficiently organized
NIPs. Thus, eukarya species have a hierarchically organized metabolism, with more central pathways located at
the cross-points of many pathway pair communications.
In contrast, the average pathway connectivity (number of
pathways a pathway is connected to) decreases from
prokarya to eukarya: bacteria species have denser NIPs
than both archaea and eukarya species as shown by the
total adjacency, average node degree, and connectedness
(or density). The higher density of bacterial NIPs also
results in higher local clustering-larger number and size
of cliques (subsets of pathways that are completely interconnected)-and higher weighted clustering coefficient,
showing more intensive pathway cross-talk in bacteria
than in eukarya species. It should be noted that due to the
fact that archaea annotations are the most recent and
likely incomplete, our conclusions concerning this kingdom should be considered preliminary.
The denser, but less organized metabolism of prokarya
is likely a consequence of higher evolutionary pressures
in these species, whose metabolic organization needs to
adapt to a greater variety of environments than that of
eukarya. Indeed, prokarya have a higher rate of horizontal gene transfer than eukarya [25]. Higher genome plasticity means less time to integrate newly acquired
metabolic capabilities with existing ones [26,27]. However, high plasticity allows fast responses to challenges
from the environment, when possessing a given metabolic capability is more important for the survival than its
fine integration in the cell.
We compared some of our results with those of Ma et
al. [15,16] and Zhu et al. [17]. A direct comparison is not
possible, as the cited authors investigated the entire net-

work of biochemical reactions-which is sparse-instead of
the more abstract and denser NIP, which reflects the
high-level organization of these reactions. Also, our study
is based on more recent metabolic datasets, with a larger
set of taxa. Yet, a comparison of the patterns in both types
of networks has its own merit. Our results do not confirm
the finding from Ma et al. about the metabolic network of
eukarya and archaea species having a longer average path
length (or average network distance) and lower OCCI
(overall closeness centralization index [28]) than those of
bacteria. Rather, we show a pattern of increasing average
network distance from archaea to bacteria to eukarya,
with values of 1.7, 1.8 and 1.9, respectively for their NIPs.
We observe a similar increase of the NIP diameter with
values of 3.7, 4.0 and 4.5. The average closeness centrality,
which is calculated from reciprocal distances, follows the
opposite trend with values of 0.61, 0.58 and 0.55. A comparison with the OCCI descriptor used in Ma et al. [16] is
not possible, however, due to the very different definition
of the two indices [28]. We also do not confirm for NIPs
the result of Zhu et al. [17] showing the metabolic networks of twelve archaea species as exhibiting lower average clustering coefficient and betweenness centrality than
those of bacteria and eukarya species. Our result for NIPs
averaged over 56 archaea species shows they have the
highest clustering coefficient (with values of 0.68, compared to 0.64 and 0.63 for bacteria and eukarya, respectively), and intermediate betweenness centrality values
(0.014, compared to 0.012 and 0.015). One may suppose
that besides the much higher connectivity of NIPs, the
considerably larger set of archaea in our study perhaps
contributes to these essentially different patterns.

Figure 1 Values of the NIP descriptors (abridged). For each group comparison, the descriptors of the structure and complexity of NIPs reported
are those shown to best discriminate the different groups of taxa considered. Bars represent the average value and standard deviation of a given descriptor for each group of taxa, based on metabolic networks extracted from KEGG. The hypothesis that the descriptor value is the same over all groups
was evaluated for each metabolic dataset either by a Kruskal-Wallis test (comparisons of three groups) or Mann-Whitney U test (comparisons of two
groups). Resulting p-values were corrected for multiple testing using Bonferroni correction. Values for all 52 descriptors are available in Additional file

number of vertices and edges, increased diameter, average network distance, and average node distance, respectively) with more central pathways (as shown by the
increased weighted betweenness centrality). However,
two other aspects of pathway centrality are found to be
less important in multicellular eukarya: the degree centrality (fraction of the network a pathway is connected
to), and the closeness centrality (inverse of the distance
between a pathway and all other pathways). The decrease
in degree centrality is independent of the network size,
and is a consequence of the smaller network connectedness. The decrease of closeness centrality is a consequence of the increased distance between pathways in the
network. Thus, we demonstrate that during the transition
from unicellular to multicellular eukarya evolution preferentially selected pathways with high betweenness centrality, which acts as switchboards for the intracellular
metabolites trafficking. Less favored were pathways
directly connected with many other pathways, and pathways with a short distance to other pathways.
Finally, we observe similar values for the average pathway connectivity and local clustering in unicellular and
multicellular eukarya as shown by the weighted and
unweighted average node degrees, and the average
weighted clustering coefficient and average information
on the distribution of the number and size of cliques,
respectively. With unicellular eukarya preceding multicellular eukarya, it appears that these two aspects of the
metabolic network topology have been conserved during
evolution as optimal organizational principles.
Free living versus host-associated bacteria

As expected, the transition from free living to host-associated bacteria is reflected by a smaller NIP. There are
fewer pathways, fewer connections between pathways
and fewer metabolites exchanged, as shown by the lower
values of the weighted NIP descriptors-which not only
takes into account the existence of links between pathways, but also the number of metabolites that are
exchanged. We demonstrate here that those descriptors
are crucial in comparing NIPs. Accounting in a more
complete manner for the cross-talk between pathways,
weighted descriptors increase the reliability of the identified pattern of change. This is best illustrated by weighted
betweenness centrality and weighted clustering coefficient, which reverse the trend of change shown by their
unweighted analogues from increasing to decreasing. The
most sensitive descriptors discriminating free living from
host-associated bacteria are those related with local clustering as reflected in the number, size and distribution of
cliques (Figure 1). Another group of descriptors with high
discriminative power are those related to connectivity
(Additional file 1). Thus, the metabolism of host-associated bacteria is sparser, and contains less 'hubs' (pathways

Page 5 of 10

with high connectivity), as shown by the smaller range of
vertex degree values.
Our results are consistent with the facts about bacteria
living under stable environments, such as within a host
body. They undergo major genome reduction [29], and
the host tissues provide a constant supply of metabolites,
eliminating the need to maintain the corresponding pathways. We show here that the adaptation to a parasitic or
symbiotic lifestyle also affects the degree of organization
of cellular metabolism, resulting in a less complex network and less communication between metabolic pathways. A similar process has been observed for gene
regulatory networks, with transcription factors-the key
organizers of the genes transcriptional activity-being
preferentially lost during the adaptation to a host-associated lifestyle [30]. In both cases the evolution toward a
less organized network certainly reflects the adaptation
to a less demanding and more static environment.
Indeed, varying environments have been shown, at least
in silico, to favor the re-use of existing metabolisms [19],
which can only be achieved through a denser and more
centrally organized wiring of metabolic pathways.
Immotile versus motile bacteria

The transition from an immobile lifestyle to a mobile one
is a major change, which causes metabolism reorganization similar to the evolutionary leap from unicellular to
multicellular species. Thus, motile bacteria have more
metabolic pathways, i.e., they are characterized by NIPs
having more vertices and edges, more (and larger)
cliques, larger average distance between pathways, and
larger ranges of vertex degrees and vertex distances than
immotile bacteria. Their metabolic network is also more
organized, with more central pathways as shown by the
weighted edge and vertex betweenness centrality descriptors. Yet, motility does not increase the diameter of the
network or the average closeness centrality, and it does
not change the network clustering.
Motile bacteria can forage for food (sugars and amino
acids), and are generally attracted or repelled by various
stimuli in their environments (e.g., chemotaxis). We show
here that the metabolism of motile bacteria evolved to be
bigger and more organized than those of immotile bacteria. As shown in Figure 2, the pathways that most benefits
from this higher organization are those related to amino
acid and carbohydrate metabolism. Although the characterization of the exact link between chemotaxis and a
centrally organized metabolism would deserve additional
investigations, this result is consistent with the increased
ability for motile bacteria to sense a shortage of intracellular nutrients, and to process extracellular ones.
Anaerobic versus aerobic bacteria

We compared the metabolic organization of bacteria living in anaerobic, facultative aerobic and aerobic conditions. Overall, aerobes and facultative aerobes have larger

Mazurie et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4:59
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/59

metabolic networks than anaerobes, as shown by the
number of vertices, edges, and total graph distance. The
characteristics of the facultative aerobes are found to be
closer to those of the aerobes than the anaerobes. However, few differences exist among the three groups in
terms of the vertex degree, distance, degree centrality or
closeness centrality descriptors. Thus, while aerobic conditions enlarge the metabolic network, its organization
remains basically the same, confirming the results from
Raymond et al. [22]. The only partial reorganization is an
increase of the average weighted betweenness centrality,
showing that some pathways acquired a more central
position in the network.
Significant changes in pathway importance

We next asked the question of how the importance of
pathways changed during the evolution of species. More
specifically, we are interested in pathways that are
acquired or lost, those evolving to be more (or less) connected to other pathways in the cell, and finally those
evolving to be more (or less) centrally located in the NIPs.
Thus, we calculated a frequency score for each metabolic pathway together with five descriptors of pathway
connectivity and pathway centrality. Frequency is the
fraction of taxa in a given subset that possess this pathway. Connectivity is represented by the weighted and
unweighted versions of vertex degree; i.e., the number of
connections with other pathways, and the number of
metabolites exchanged. Centrality is represented by the
closeness centrality and the weighted and unweighted
versions of betweenness centrality; i.e., distances to other
pathways, and fraction of the pathways cross-talk passing
through. Closeness centrality may be regarded as a measure of how long it will take in average for metabolites to
spread (through successive enzymatic conversions) from
a pathway to other reachable pathways in the NIP: the
higher the value, the shorter time needed. Betweenness
centrality is a measure of how much of the metabolite
traffic in the cell goes through a given pathway. High values reveal more efficiently organized metabolic networks,
with central pathways being reused in, and in control of, a
multitude of metabolic processes.
We tested the null hypothesis that the values taken by
these scores are not significantly different across subsets
of taxa. For each score and pair of subsets a p-value was
calculated (using the Fisher's exact test for the frequency
score, and Mann-Whitney U-test for the scores of connectivity and centrality) together with the amplitude of
variation of the score. Those p-values were corrected for
multiple testing using the Benjamini-Hochberg method
[31]. Finally, the median variation and p-value for pathways in the same functional category (as defined by
KEGG) was extracted. The results are shown in Figure 2

Page 6 of 10

and in Additional file 2. From those we made the following observations:
- Pathways related to lipid metabolism are better represented and integrated in the metabolism of multicellular
eukarya than unicellular eukarya. In the case of vertebrates, this evolution certainly allowed the apparition of
complex signal transduction systems based on products
of lipid metabolism, like steroid hormones [32].
- Pathways related to glycan metabolism are more frequent and more integrated in the metabolism of multicellular eukarya than unicellular eukarya. This can be
explained by the importance of extra-cellular matrix, of
which proteoglycans are an important structural component, for the formation of multicellular structures [33]. It
also supports the importance of glycosylation as a key
mechanism for cell-cell communications and interactions, as shown by the fact that nearly all membrane and
extracellular proteins are glycosylated [34]. Finally, this
result is consistent with some of the findings from Peregrin-Alvarez et al. [35] showing a higher conservation of
glycan-related pathways in eukarya.
- Similarly, pathways related to glycan metabolism are
more integrated in the metabolism of motile compared to
immotile bacteria. This supports the importance of glycans as a motility factor [36,37]. Motile bacteria also have
a higher integration of pathways related to the biodegradation of xenobiotics than immotile bacteria. Xenobiotics
are poisons in the surrounding or inside the bacteria cell.
Such metabolic capability is certainly advantageous for
the motile cell, allowing it to actively colonize polluted
environments with few or no competitors.
- The increase of metabolic capabilities associated to
the transition from an anaerobic to aerobic lifestyle [22]
essentially benefited to pathways related to lipid, amino
acids and xenobiotics degradation metabolism. These
pathways are also more connected and more integrated,
especially so for xenobiotic degradation. This better integration certainly results from the cross-talks between
many pathways that oxidative processes provide. E.g., the
oxidation of amino acids and lipids to produce energy or
intermediary metabolites, or the oxidation of xenobiotics
[38] as exemplified by the cytochrome oxidase family.
- The decrease of NIP density observed when transitioning from free living to host-associated bacteria
appears to be due in part to a significant decrease in the
frequency of pathways related to carbohydrate and
energy metabolism. Also, there is a general decrease of
connectivity and centrality of all pathways. This is consistent with results from Henrissat et al. [39], showing that
the lack of glycogen metabolism is a trait associated with
parasitic behavior in bacteria.
Finally, we report two observations, which we leave
open for possible interpretation. We observed a divergence between change of centrality and connectivity for

Figure 2 Effects of lineage and environment on pathway frequency, connectivity and centrality. The amplitude of variation of six scores of frequency, connectivity and centrality, and a p-value evaluating the significance of this variation are reported for all metabolic pathways. P-values were
calculated by either a Fisher's Exact Test (frequency) or Mann-Whitney U-text (connectivity and centrality), and corrected for multiple testing using
the Benjamini-Hochberg method [31]. The median variation and the p-value for pathways in the same functional category were pictured as either a
triangle or a diamond. A triangle pointing left (*) means the score increases from left to right (e.g., from Prokarya to Eukarya), while a triangle pointing
right (Ј) means the score decreases from left to right. A diamond means the score does not change. The position of the symbol is proportional to
the median corrected p-value, i.e. False Discovery Rate, and its size is proportional to the amplitude of variation. All values are available in Additional
file 2. B.C.: Betweenness Centrality.

pathways related to amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism when comparing unicellular and multicellular
eukarya, and pathways related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites when comparing prokarya and
eukarya. These pathways are less directly connected to
the rest of the metabolic network in the latter groups,
while being more central. It means that these pathways
process metabolites from and to a smaller range of neighboring pathways, while tunneling more of the overall
metabolic fluxes in the cell.

Conclusions
Addressing the effect of evolutionary pressures on the
metabolism of species, we used a higher representation of
metabolisms-the Network of Interacting Pathways, or
NIP-focusing on the logic of metabolic organization,
rather than on the details of the underlying molecular
mechanisms. In this study we demonstrate that specific
aspects of the structure and complexity of these NIPs are
discriminative of species from different lineages and lifestyle; i.e., species under distinct evolutionary pressures.
We found that species that evolved to accommodate
more complex lifestyles; e.g., eukarya compared to
prokarya, multicellular eukarya compared to unicellular
eukarya, motile bacteria compared to immotile bacteria,
developed not only bigger but also more structured metabolic networks. Communication between pathways is
typically enhanced by the addition of hubs (highly connected pathways, which convert metabolites for a
broader range of input and output pathways) and switchboards (centrally connected pathways, which capture a
large fraction of the whole metabolite traffic). As for the
transition from anaerobic to aerobic bacteria, we
observed only enlargement of networks with the inclusion of additional metabolic pathways, while the organization and complexity of the cross talk between pathways
remained mostly unchanged. The reorganization of metabolic networks is shown to be heterogeneous, with specific categories of pathways being promoted to more
central or connected locations. Thus, we demonstrated
the increased importance of lipid metabolism for multicellular eukarya, glycan and xenobiotics metabolism for
motile bacteria, and lipid, amino acid and xenobiotics
metabolism for aerobic bacteria. Conversely, we found
that the decrease in complexity of the metabolism of
host-associated bacteria significantly impacted carbohydrate and energy metabolism.
The unique combination of methods from graph theory, information theory, and machine learning used for
this study enabled the identification of statistically significant differences between the NIPs of species, as well as
the quantification of the relation between these differences and the species lineage or lifestyle. The same
method could as well be applied to other types of net-

work-based representations of species, as long as enough
experimental data are available to represent groups of
species of interest. The rapidly growing collection of protein interaction networks being published suggests this
dataset could be the next logical subject of study to track
how evolution shaped the molecular biology of cells.

Methods
Network of interacting pathways

Metabolic reactions for 1143 species were retrieved from
January 2010 release of the KEGG database [24] using the
KEGG API. All currency metabolites (except water) were
kept, based on the conclusion from Mazurie et al. [23]
that those common metabolites improve the capability of
metabolic networks to capture the phylogeny of species.
Out of these 1143 species, 1042 were selected as having
completely sequenced genomes according to GOLD 3.0
[40], and a consistent metabolic pathway annotation.
Consistency of pathway annotation was evaluated by
comparing the number of pathways for each species to
the logarithm of its number of ORFs. The resulting correlation was significant (r2 of 0.66, p-value below 2.2 × 1016). All species with a number of pathways below average
(species in the lowest 5% residuals) were filtered out.
Finally, these 1042 species were clustered into 743 taxa to
account for strains of the same species, subspecies,
pathovars and biovars. For each of these 743 taxa, Networks of Interacting Pathways (NIPs) were reconstructed
by linking overlapping metabolic pathways sharing at
least one metabolite. I.e., two pathways are connected if
the enzymes in the first pathway consume or produce at
least one metabolite that is produced or consumed in the
second pathway. The resulting links between pathways
were weighted by the number of metabolites exchanged
[23].
Groups of taxa

Based on the annotations from GOLD 3.0 [40] the 743
taxa were separated into the following groups: 656
prokarya (56 archaea and 600 bacteria) and 87 eukarya,
44 unicellular and 43 multicellular eukarya, 253 aerobe,
126 anaerobe and 170 facultative aerobe bacteria, 322
motile and 202 immotile bacteria, 4 halotolerant and 15
halophile bacteria, 525 free-living and 61 host-associated
bacteria, and 24 psychrophile, 508 mesophile, and 61
thermophile Bacteria. All annotations are available in the
Additional file 3.
Network descriptors

Four categories of quantitative descriptors of network
structure and complexity, based on the notions of degree,
centrality, distance and cliques, were used to characterize
the NIPs constructed to represent taxa (see Additional
file 4 and associated references for details on the 52

Mazurie et al. BMC Systems Biology 2010, 4:59
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/4/59

descriptors used-25 basic and 27 derivatives). This set
includes descriptors that have been successfully used in
other fields [41-46], as well as others specifically developed for the needs of our study. The latter include several
weighted descriptors characterizing the intensity of cross
talk between the metabolic pathways; they present a
more realistic picture of network connectivity, distances,
paths, and centrality at the higher organizational level of
NIPs. Complete subgraphs (cliques) and their distribution were another addition to the basic topological characteristics of metabolic networks. The extensive set of
network descriptors devised for this study thus enables
the covering of all potentially relevant features of intracellular networks when comparing taxa. The values of these
descriptors were calculated for each NIP using the NetworkX library https://networkx.lanl.gov/.
Machine learning

For each taxa group comparison a training set was constructed by reporting for each taxa the values taken by all
52 descriptors of its NIP together with the group it
belong to. These training sets are available as Additional
file 5. Supervised learning algorithms implemented in the
Weka toolbox (Witten et al. [47] and Additional file 6)
were applied on the training sets to predict the taxa group
membership from the NIP descriptors values. A score of
accuracy and Kappa statistic of the 10-fold cross-validation and that of the whole training set were calculated by
comparing known and predicted membership. For a
given training set, the accuracy and Kappa statistic were
then taken as the highest obtained among all classification models. A high accuracy and Kappa statistic would
mean the taxa group membership could be predicted
from the NIP's high-level organization of metabolic networks. The smallest subset of NIP descriptors that still
performs as well as the complete set of 52 was identified
using feature selection algorithms [48,49] and a heuristic
evaluation of subsets of descriptors on the classification
models identified earlier as the best ones. A tool, MetaClassify, was developed to automate the training of the
classification models and to retrieve the results http://
oenone.net/tools/.
