Abstract
Background: Metagenomic analysis provides a rich source of biological information for otherwise
intractable viral communities. However, study of viral metagenomes has been hampered by its
nearly complete reliance on BLAST algorithms for identification of DNA sequences. We sought to
develop algorithms for examination of viral metagenomes to identify the origin of sequences
independent of BLAST algorithms. We chose viral metagenomes obtained from two hot springs,
Bear Paw and Octopus, in Yellowstone National Park, as they represent simple microbial
populations where comparatively large contigs were obtained. Thermal spring metagenomes have
high proportions of sequences without significant Genbank homology, which has hampered
identification of viruses and their linkage with hosts. To analyze each metagenome, we developed
a method to classify DNA fragments using genome signature-based phylogenetic classification
(GSPC), where metagenomic fragments are compared to a database of oligonucleotide signatures
for all previously sequenced Bacteria, Archaea, and viruses.
Results: From both Bear Paw and Octopus hot springs, each assembled contig had more similarity
to other metagenome contigs than to any sequenced microbial genome based on GSPC analysis,
suggesting a genome signature common to each of these extreme environments. While viral
metagenomes from Bear Paw and Octopus share some similarity, the genome signatures from each
locale are largely unique. GSPC using a microbial database predicts most of the Octopus
metagenome has archaeal signatures, while bacterial signatures predominate in Bear Paw; a finding
consistent with those of Genbank BLAST. When using a viral database, the majority of the Octopus
metagenome is predicted to belong to archaeal virus Families Globuloviridae and Fuselloviridae, while
none of the Bear Paw metagenome is predicted to belong to archaeal viruses. As expected, when
microbial and viral databases are combined, each of the Octopus and Bear Paw metagenomic
contigs are predicted to belong to viruses rather than to any Bacteria or Archaea, consistent with
the apparent viral origin of both metagenomes.
Conclusion: That BLAST searches identify no significant homologs for most metagenome contigs,
while GSPC suggests their origin as archaeal viruses or bacteriophages, indicates GSPC provides a
complementary approach in viral metagenomic analysis.

Background
The study of metagenomes has provided important
insights into physiological processes and into the diversity
of microbial and viral communities in different environments [1,2]. Metagenomic analysis is based on highthroughput DNA sequencing of clone libraries of massisolated cells or viral particles from different ecological
environments, and is strictly defined as the study of those
organisms that inhabit a given biological niche. Such
community analysis has contributed to an improved
understanding of microbial community structure, and can
provide a broader perspective on microbial community
composition and function than analysis of 16s rDNA.
Over the past decade, it has become increasingly clear that
viruses are a significant component of every ecological
niche in which cellular life exists. Abundances ranging
from 104 to 108 virus-like-particles per milliliter have been
detected in virtually every aquatic environment studied
[3], although abundances in hot springs are generally at
the lower end of this range [4]. Estimates of viral diversity
suggest that several thousand different viral types exist in
a given pool, probably having a profound impact on population structure and genomic content of host populations [5-8].
Studies of viral diversity have been hampered by the
absence of universal signature sequences (e.g. 16S rDNA).
Metagenomic analysis has provided much of the population-level insight into diversity and distribution of viruses
in the environment [9]. The few studies addressing bacteriophage and archaeal viral assemblages have led to
deeper understandings of the diversity present in these
communities and may aid in the determination of how
the presence of certain viruses may shape microbial communities [7,10]; however, these studies also have highlighted the need for improved approaches in the analysis
of viral metagenomes. In each of the studied viral metagenomes, a large proportion of sequences had no significant
homologs identified in Genbank non-redundant database
[9,11-13]. Furthermore, in a recent viral metagenome survey in thermal environments, half of the sequences had
no BLASTx homolog in the Genbank nr database [12],
similar to results found in marine and estuarine environments [9,11], presumably due to the relative dearth of
annotated thermophilic viral sequences in Genbank.
While all of the unidentified sequences in thermal virus
metagenomes presumably represent bacteriophage or
archaeal viruses, neither the host nor types of virus can be
ascertained [4,12]. Since, to date, BLAST alignments [14]
have been the predominant means of associating a viral
metagenomic sequence with a likely host, the lack of significant homology between most of viral metagenomic
sequences and sequences in Genbank has impeded our
understanding of host-virus relationships.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/420

Genome signature analysis of DNA sequences measures
biases in DNA oligonucleotide composition rather than
sequence similarity, and is studied in an alignment-independent manner [15-18]. For each genome or portion of
genome with detectable differences, the genome signature
for each sequence analyzed will be unique [15,19]. Previous data has demonstrated that after their divergence,
microbes retain patterns of genome signature reflective of
their recent common ancestry similar to that of 16s rDNA
[15]. Utilizing this quality of the genome signature, the
technique now has been adapted to predict the ancestry of
eukaryal, archaeal, and bacterial metagenomic sequences
[20].
The classification of viruses has traditionally been based
on morphological characteristics [21,22]. This classification system is widely used for cultivated viruses, which
significantly biases our view of diversity [23]. Attempts
have been made to correlate sequences and morphologies
[24], but these have proven less useful in extreme thermal
environments. The absence of a universal signature gene
has hampered classification of viral genomes based on
genomic sequences Recent studies of bacteriophages have
identified conserved patterns of oligonucleotides used as
genome signatures unique to each genome analyzed that
appear to be co-evolving with their hosts [25]. In contrast,
these patterns are shared for groups of eukaryotic viruses
in a manner largely independent of their host [25].
Terrestrial thermal aquifers are vast ecosystems with abundances of microbes and viruses approaching those of the
ocean [4,12]. At temperatures > 74°Celsius, the hot
springs in this study are significantly above the temperature limit for eukaryotic life, generally accepted to be
around 62°C, and therefore, harbor communities strictly
composed of Bacteria, Archaea, and their respective
viruses [26]. While comprehensive studies of viral communities in these extreme environments are just beginning, culture-based studies have indicated the presence of
bacteriophages of the bacterial Genus Thermus [27,28], as
well as archaeal viruses of the archaeal Genera Sulfolobus,
Pyrobaculum, Acidianus, and Thermoproteus [29].
We sought to develop new methods based on genome signature to apply to analysis of viral communities from two
separate thermal pools, Bear Paw and Octopus Springs, in
Yellowstone National Park. Our goals were to: 1) develop
the technique of genome signature-based phylogenetic
classification (GSPC) to accurately predict the presumed
host/virus relationships of known bacteriophages, 2) analyze the differences between viral metagenomes from Bear
Paw and Octopus hot springs, 3) apply the GSPC technique to viral metagenomes to predict the microbial host
of unknown members of the viral community, and 4)

apply GSPC to classify the viruses present in Bear Paw and
Octopus hot springs.

ophages were classified based on the branches deep to
that paraphyletic position.

Results

Using a group of bacteriophages in which their bacterial
host has been well-described (Additional file 1), GSPC
was able to classify greater than 90% by Phylum, 70% by
Class and Order, and 50% by Family and Genus (Figure
1). When analyzing by specific oligonucleotide sizes,
tetranucleotide-based phylogeny classifies a higher percentage of bacteriophages than trinucleotides or pentanucleotides (Figure 1). Because of its increased sensitivity in
classifying bacteriophages according to their bacterial
hosts, tetranucleotide-based GSPC was used for all subsequent analyses.

GSPC for known bacteriophages based on a microbial
database
To compare viral genome signatures with those of Bacteria
and Archaea, we constructed a microbial database of oligonucleotide frequencies for all currently sequenced Bacteria and Archaea. The database contains frequencies of all
dinucleotide, trinucleotide, tetranucleotide, pentanucleotide, and hexanucleotide combinations for each
genome. To determine similarity between known bacteriophages and their potential hosts in the microbial database, Euclidean distances based on the sum of the
differences for all oligonucleotide combinations were
determined for each known bacteriophage and each database genome. The resulting distance matrix was subjected
to neighbor-joining analysis, and phylogenies were used
to classify the known bacteriophages. In cases where the
known bacteriophages were positioned monophyletically, the bacteriophages were classified based on the
Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, and Genus of
that monophyletic group. In cases where the known bacteriophages were positioned paraphyletically, the bacteri-

GSPC for hot spring metagenomes based on a microbial

We analyzed two separate hot springs, Bear Paw and Octopus in Yellowstone National Park, to gain a deeper understanding of the viral populations native to each habitat.
Each hot spring is located within 5 kilometers of the other,
with Bear Paw characterized by a surface temperature of
74°Celsius, visible pigmented microbial growth at the
surface, a pH near 8.0, and estimated phage abundance
from 105 to 106 particles per milliliter. The Octopus hot
spring is characterized by a pH near 8.0, a surface temper-

ature of 93°Celsius, an estimated viral abundances from
105 to 106 particles per milliliter, and no visible growth at
the surface [30]. Both thermophilic Bacteria and Archaea
previously have been identified in Octopus hot spring,
with Thermocrinis and Aquificales predominating among
the sediment and filament Bacteria [31-33]. Due to the
high temperatures, these hot springs are both devoid of
eukaryotic life [26].
Using GSPC based on a microbial database, the majority
of Bear Paw contigs are predicted to have bacterial hosts,
while few are predicted to have archaeal hosts (Figure 2,
Panels A and B). For Bear Paw contig 24, its phylogenetic
position supports a classification with Thermus thermophilus (Figure 3), a thermophilic Bacterium highly characteristic of hot springs of similar temperature and water
chemistry [34,35]. The closest homolog identified in Genbank for Bear Paw contig 24 belongs to another thermophilic Bacterium Aquifex aeolicus (Additional file 2).
Both Genera Aquifex and Thermus are closely related based
on genome signature-based phylogeny (Figure 3), despite
their apparent divergence based on other criteria [36]. The
fact that GSPC groups thermophilic Bacteria more closely
with thermophilic Archaea than with mesophilic Bacteria
is probably related to convergent evolution specific to
thermophiles [37,38], but should not impair the predictive value of the method. GSPC based on a microbial database predicts other Bear Paw contigs belong to host
bacterial Classes Bacteroidetes, Alphaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacteria, and Spirochaetes (Figure 2, Panels A and B).
When sequences from Octopus hot spring were analyzed
by GSPC based on a microbial database, most were predicted to have archaeal hosts (Figure 2, Panels C and D).
For Octopus contig 9974, its phylogenetic position supports a classification with Aeropyrum pernix, a hyper-thermophilic Archaeon belonging to the Class Thermoprotei,
(Figure 4). Based on Genbank BLAST, the most closely
related homolog of Octopus contig 9974 belongs to a
virus isolated from the Archaeon Sulfolobus islandicus
(Additional file 2), another hyper-thermophilic Archaeon
belonging to the Class Thermoprotei. Most contigs from
Octopus have substantial oligonucleotide similarity with
the archaeal Genus Pyrobaculum (Additional file 2), which
also belongs to the Class Thermoprotei. The abundance of
contigs predicted to belong to the Genus Pyrobaculum suggests that Pyrobaculum viruses represent the most abundant viruses in Octopus hot spring. This is highly
consistent with a previous metagenomic study of Octopus
and Bear Paw hot springs in which homology to nearly
the entire genome of Pyrobaculum spherical virus was
detected [12,39]. Other Octopus contigs are predicted to
belong to bacterial Classes Actinobacteria, Spirochaetes, and
Deinococci, which includes the thermophilic Bacterium
Thermus thermophilus (Figure 2, Panels C and D).

GSPC analysis classifies metagenomic contigs individually based on their similarity to other microbial genomes;
however, classification also can be performed on the collective metagenomes. When the Bear Paw metagenomic
contigs were analyzed collectively, the most recent common ancestor of each contig was found within the Bear
Paw metagenome (Figure 5a), with the exception of contigs 697 and 1538 (Figure 5b). A similar finding is present
for the Octopus metagenome, where the most recent common ancestor for each contig is represented in the Octopus metagenome rather than the microbial database
(Figure 6). The collective Octopus metagenome is
grouped paraphyletically to the archaeal Genus Pyrobaculum (Figure 6), consistent with the findings for each individual contig (Additional file 2).
Collective analysis of Bear Paw and Octopus hot springs
When analyzed separately, contigs from Bear Paw and
Octopus share a common genome signature with contigs
from their respective metagenomes, suggesting that patterns of genome signature may be relatively specific to
each environment. When metagenomes of Octopus and
Bear Paw were analyzed together based on a microbial
database, many of the Bear Paw contigs continue to demonstrate recent ancestry within the Bear Paw metagenome,
with similar observations for the Octopus metagenome
(Figure 7). Some overlap exists between groups of Octopus and Bear Paw contigs, suggesting the presence of
shared microbial flora between the habitats (Figure 7),
which is consistent with previous tBLASTx results [12].
GSPC for known bacteriophages based on a viral database
Previous data indicates that when analyzing genome signature for diverse groups of viruses, they segregate largely
according to their Family designation [25]. Furthermore,
double stranded DNA viruses, including bacteriophages
and archaeal viruses, cluster separately from other types of
viruses such as single stranded DNA viruses and RNA
viruses. Based on genome signature, bacteriophages typically segregate either according to their bacterial hosts or
their Family designation (e.g. Podoviridae, Myoviridae, or
Siphoviridae) [25].

To classify metagenomic contigs according to their respective viral Families, we created a database of oligonucleotide signatures for all available sequenced viruses, and
subjected a group of known bacteriophages (Additional
file 1) to GSPC. Because the viral database contains all
currently sequenced viruses, we selected random fragments of differing sizes from these viruses to evaluate their
predicted ancestry. When full-length bacteriophages were
evaluated, their predicted ancestry matches their ancestry
based on morphological features (Figure 8). For bacteriophage fragments of 10,000 nucleotides, nearly 90% have
predicted ancestry consistent with that of morphological

features at the Family level. Most fragments of 5,000
nucleotides are predicted to be bacteriophages, with
nearly 70% predicted according to Family. For fragments
of 2,000 nucleotides, most are predicted to be bacteriophages; however, many are predicted to be bacteriophages outside of the Caudoviridae Family (Figure 8 and
data not shown).

GSPC for hot spring metagenomes based on a viral
database
We sought to predict the viral Families present in the Bear
Paw and Octopus hot springs by subjecting contigs from
both metagenomes to GSPC based on a viral database. As
expected, the majority of the sequences from both Bear
Paw and Octopus metagenomes are classified as double

together near their bacterial hosts [25]. We hypothesize
that this clustering represents a limitation in the ability of
bacteriophages to fully ameliorate to their host genome
signature, and may be necessary for the bacteriophages to
maintain host range [25]. The metagenomes from Bear
Paw and Octopus hot springs, are limited to bacteriophages and archaeal viruses based on previous analysis
of the contigs [12]. We constructed a database containing
all sequenced Archaea, Bacteria, and viruses to determine
if Bear Paw and Octopus metagenomic contigs have viral
signatures or microbial signatures. Using GSPC based on
this combination database, each of the contigs from Bear
Paw and Octopus were classified similarly to their classification based on the viral database (Additional file 3), further suggesting their origin as bacteriophages and archaeal
viruses.

stranded DNA viruses (Figure 9), which is a result of selection due to the library construction method. Each of the
common bacteriophage Families, including Siphoviridae,
Myoviridae, and Podoviridae are predicted to be present in
both metagenomes. The archaeal virus Family Globuloviridae, including Thermoproteus spherical virus and Pyrobaculum spherical virus, is substantially represented in
Octopus hot spring (Figure 10), consistent with the predicted archaeal virus predominance when using a microbial database (Additional file 2). Another archaeal virus
Family, Fuselloviridae, also is predicted to have members
present in the Octopus metagenome (Figure 9). The
majority of the Bear Paw metagenomic contigs are predicted to belong to the bacteriophage Family Caudoviridae
(includes Myoviridae, Podoviridae, and Siphoviridae), with
no individual contigs predicted to belong to archaeal
viruses (Figure 9). The predicted bacteriophage predominance in Bear Paw and the predicted archaeal virus predominance in Octopus is consistent with the results of
Genbank BLAST, and with well described correspondence
between higher temperatures and higher predominance
of Archaea [36].
GSPC based on a combination database
Previous data indicates that when bacteriophages and
their bacterial hosts are included in genome signaturebased phylogenies, bacteriophages tend to cluster

Other methods of metagenomic classification
Using Genbank BLAST algorithms, much of the Octopus
metagenome has no identifiable homolog (Table 1).
Homologs to only 23% of the Octopus contigs were identified, while 86% of the Bear Paw contigs had identifiable
homologs (Table 1 and Figure 2, Panels B and D). Most of
the homologs to Bear Paw contigs were from Bacteria,
while Octopus contigs had many homologs to Archaea,
Bacteria, and Eukarya. The lower proportion of identifiable homologs in Octopus compared to Bear Paw, suggests
that an identification bias might exist based on a relative
paucity of thermophilic viral sequences present in the
Genbank database.

Another method for identification of metagenomic
sequence fragments based on oligonucleotide sequence
biases is the application Phylopythia, which uses a support vector machine to classify sequence fragments
according to its database of oligonucleotide biases that
includes Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya [20]. Previous
data has demonstrated that for both bacterial and
archaeal DNA fragments, the technique is quite robust in
assigning fragments to different taxonomic classes [20].
While not developed specifically for bacteriophages, we
applied Phylopythia towards the identification of metagenomic contigs from Bear Paw and Octopus. Phylopythia
classified 91% of the sequence contigs from Bear Paw, and
91% from Octopus (Table 1). Many of the sequences
could not be identified beyond the level of Kingdom or
Class (Additional file 2). Some sequences were classified
to eukaryotic Classes (including Ascomycota, Insecta, Sordariomycetes, and Arthropoda), bacterial Classes (including
Clostridia, Bacteroidetes, Gammaproteobacteria, Epsilonproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Spirochaetes), and
archaeal Classes (including Thermoprotei, and Methanomicrobia) (Additional file 2). Since no Eukaryotes previously
have been isolated at these temperatures [26], their viruses
are unlikely to be members of these communities.

Using GSPC, Genbank BLAST, and Phylopythia, many of
the metagenome contigs were classified to the archaeal
Class Thermoprotei. Because of the apparent similarities in
classifying contigs between each method, we used the
Spearman non-parametric test to determine if there was a
significant correlation between the classification predictions of each methodology. Because with certain methods, taxonomic classification was only possible at the
level of Class (Additional file 2), we used the predicted
Class of each contig for further evaluation. When examining the contigs, there was a high level of agreement
between contig classification by GSPC based on a microbial database using either trinucleotides or tetranucleotides (Table 2). When comparing GSPC based on a
microbial database using either criterion, both have significant agreement with those classification results of
Genbank. There is no significant agreement between
results of Genbank and Phylopythia, and less agreement
between GSPC and Phylopythia. Nearly identical results
were obtained using Kendall tau's non-parametric test
(data not shown).

Discussion and conclusion
The exploration of microbial assemblages through microbiome genome analysis has provided insights into both
community structure and physiology [1,2], but also has
revealed a greater need for advances in technology to identify community constituents without significant homology in Genbank. Viral metagenomic analysis currently is
substantially less well developed than that of cellular populations, and is limited by a low proportion of viral
sequences compared to cellular sequences. Genome signature analysis is independent of nucleotide or amino
acid alignments, and predicts relationships based on separate principles from those of BLAST search algorithms
[15].
We sought to create two separate databases based on oligonucleotide frequencies of all sequenced microbial cellular and viral genomes, respectively, to determine whether
known viruses could be used for accurate prediction of
host microbe or virus ancestry. Our data demonstrate that
when longer nucleotide sequences are available, GSPC

Genome signature phylogenetic classification of known bacteriophages using a viral database

Genome signature phylogenetic classification of known bacteriophages using a viral database. Each bacteriophage
fragment was subjected to genome signature classification as described in Materials and Methods. Each fragment was classified
according to its position on the genome signature phylogeny, and each position compared with that of its classification based
on morphological features. The percentage of bacteriophage fragments classified consistent with that of its morphological features is represented. Blue represents full length bacteriophages, red represents random bacteriophage fragments of 10,000

makes more accurate predictions of both host and viral
ancestry (Figures 1 and 8). As the length of nucleotide
sequences decreases, GSPC accuracy also decreases (Figures 1 and 8). The heterogeneity of oligonucleotide signatures across certain bacteriophage genomes may explain
why individual bacteriophage fragments are not always
representative of their viral or host genomes [19,25].
Because previously sequenced viral metagenomes [13,40]
are comprised mostly of single reads or smaller contigs,
they generally are not amenable to GSPC analysis. Bear
Paw and Octopus metagenomes are less diverse and have
larger contigs [12], thus providing a more suitable dataset
for GSPC. The GSPC method predicts many of the hot
spring metagenomic contigs as archaeal viruses and thermophilic Bacteria (Figure 2), a finding that is consistent
with the environment from which they were recovered.
When homologs to the metagenomic contigs could be
identified in Genbank, the presumptive hosts were generally consistent with the findings of GSPC (Additional file
2 and Table 2). While there was some agreement in contig
prediction between GSPC and Phylopythia, many of the
contigs were predicted to be derived from dissimilar
organisms. Because GSPC predicts the origin of many of
the contigs to be consistent with the known flora of these

hot springs, while Phylopythia predicts many to have
eukaryotic origin, we believe GSPC may provide a more
specific methodology for contigs from such extreme environments.
We chose to analyze the metagenomes of two separate hot
springs, Bear Paw and Octopus in Yellowstone National
Park. Their conditions at the surface differ, suggesting
there may be differences between the microbial flora
present in each environment. Genbank BLAST and GSPC
based on a microbial database both predict the origin of
many Bear Paw contigs to have bacterial origin, while the
viral database suggests the contigs are from bacteriophages (Additional file 3). In contrast, Genbank BLAST
and GSPC based on a microbial database predict many
Octopus contigs to have archaeal origin, with the viral
database indicating many contigs may belong to archaeal
virus Families Fuselloviridae and Globuloviridae (Additional
file 3). In support of this finding, a previous metagenomic
study of these hot springs detected homologs to nearly the
entire genome of Pyrobaculum spherical virus [12], a member of the archaeal virus Family Globuloviridae. Although
geochemistry has a large influence on the microbial composition of hot springs, microbial populations are highly
temperature dependent [36]. We believe the bacterial pre-

Figure 9signature phylogenetic classification of contigs from Bear Paw and Octopus metagenomes using a viral database
Genome
Genome signature phylogenetic classification of contigs from Bear Paw and Octopus metagenomes using a
viral database. Each contig was subjected to genome signature classification as described in Materials and Methods. The
resulting number of contigs or percentage of the Octopus or Bear Paw contigs is presented by Family. Panel A – number of
contigs and Panel B – percentage of contigs. Blue represents Octopus contigs and red represents Bear Paw contigs.

dominance in Bear Paw hot spring compared to Octopus
may be related to the lower temperature present in Bear
Paw.

particularly when those searches fail to identify significant
homology.

Methods
As greater numbers of viral communities are studied, new
techniques for assessing metagenomic constituents are
necessary. Previous studies of viral metagenomes have
underscored the need for new techniques, as most of the
available metagenomic sequences have limited detectable
similarity to sequences in Genbank [9,11-13]. GSPC provides an approach complementary to BLAST search algorithms, taking advantage of properties of DNA patterns of
nucleotide usage rather than nucleotide alignments.
While not applicable to most lower temperature viral
metagenomes due to the limited size of typical contigs in
most studies, GSPC will likely become more suitable for
analysis of these environments as next generation
sequencing platforms allow collection of much larger
amounts of sequence data and assembly of larger contigs.
This will substantially increase the sensitivity in viral
metagenomic studies in both predicting the host and classifying the types of viruses in the community. GSPC is a
facile approach for classifying viral metagenomic
sequences and inferring host relationships and is a highly
complementary alternative to traditional BLAST searches,

Virus collection and sequencing
Samples were collected in October 2003 from both Bear
Paw and Octopus hot springs in the lower geyser basin in
Yellowstone National Park. Viral particles were isolated,
and libraries were constructed and sequenced and
sequences were assembled as described [12]. Libraries
from each hot spring were constructed using methods that
select only for double stranded DNA viruses. We previously have based our minimum genome sequence length
for analysis on the assumption that 95% of tetranucleotide combinations should occur at least 10 times
[18,25]. The minimum genome length analyzed in this
study was 1.9 kb (3.8 kb when analyzing both strands),
which represents an assumption that 95% of tetranucleotide combinations should occur at least 7.5 times.
Approximately 19.3% of the Bear Paw metagenomic contigs and 39.0% of the Octopus metagenomic contigs conformed to these criteria. Since hundreds or thousands of
viral types inhabit Bear Paw and Octopus hot springs [12],
these contigs represent only the most abundant viral
types. Both metagenomes are available from the NCBI

Oligonucleotide analysis
To determine oligonucleotide frequencies for genomes
and metagenomic contigs, a Zero-Order Markov algorithm [41] was used, in which the expected number of oli-

gonucleotides was determined by removing biases in
mononucleotide frequencies, as determined by the equation: E(W) = [(Aa * Cc * Gg * Tt) * N], where A, C, G, and
T represent the frequency of the four nucleotides within
the window being evaluated, respectively, a, c, g, and t represent the number of nucleotides A, C, G, and T in each
oligonucleotide, respectively, and N represents the length
of the genome or contig being evaluated [15]. The frequency of divergence for each oligonucleotide is
expressed as the ratio of observed to expected, and were
determined for each genome studied using Swaap
Genome Search version 1.0.1 [42].
Microbial and viral databases
A database was constructed containing all di-, tri-, tetra-,
penta-, and hexanucleotide frequencies for all fully
sequenced bacterial and archaeal genomes available in the
Genbank database (383 genomes stored in the database
on 5-21-07). Including separate chromosomes for certain
organisms, there were 440 separate entries in the microbial database. A separate database was constructed for all
di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotide frequencies for
all known fully sequenced viruses using the Genbank
database (3866 genomes stored in the database on 8-1007).
Genome signature-based phylogenetic classification
Genome signature-based phylogenetic classification
(GSPC) was performed on individual metagenomic contigs, collective groups of metagenomic contigs, and viral
fragments. Briefly, oligonucleotide frequencies were
determined for all viral sequences, and Euclidean distances between each fragment and all frequencies in the
databases were determined. Distances were determined
by the equation: Dt = 1/NN * Σ|F1(W) - F2(W)|, where
F1(W) and F2(W) represent F(W) for each of the oligonucleotides for any organisms or fragments 1 and 2, and N is
the length of the oligonucleotide under evaluation
[15,16]. Bootstrapping was performed by sampling with
replacement of each of the oligonucleotide frequencies,

phylograms were created using neighbor-joining analysis
based on the resulting distance matrices using Swaap
Genome Search 1.0.1 [42], reviewed via Paup 4.0b10 [43]
or Treeview [44], and portions of phylogenies containing
branches of interest were displayed using Corel Draw 11
(Corel Corp., Ottawa, Canada).

Other analysis of metagenomic contigs
All metagenomic contigs also were subjected to classification analysis using Phylopythia and Genbank tBLASTx
analysis using the nonredundant database [14,20]. Hits
were considered significant if the Expect values were less
than 10-3.

For the microbial database, contigs were classified based
on their phylogenetic position, either monophyletic or
paraphyletic. In cases where contigs were grouped monophyletically, they were classified based on the Kingdom,
Phylum, Class, Order, Family, and Genus of that monophyletic group. When contigs were grouped paraphyletically, they were classified based on the Kingdom, Phylum,
Class, Order, Family, and Genus of branches deep to that
paraphyletic position. Example output of the sequence
classification for the microbial database is demonstrated
in Additional file 4. For the viral database, contigs were
classified based on the DNA type, host type (bacterial or
archaeal vs. eukaryal), viral type (Caudovirus vs. other),
Family, and virus designation (e.g. T-7 like virus, etc...)
based on the same principles as classification based on the
microbial database.

Spearman's rho correlation test was performed on
metagenome contigs using SPSS (SPSS Corp., Chicago,
IL). Briefly, metagenome contigs were classified using
Genbank, GSPC, or Phylopythia. The results of each
method were compiled using the predicted Class of each
contig, and each Class was coded using numbers 1 to 41.
The resulting tables were then subjected to Spearman's
rho correlation test or Kendall tau's correlation test using
SPSS (SPSS Corp., Chicago, IL). Results were considered
significant when p < 0.01.

Analysis of known viruses
Oligonucleotide frequencies for known complete and partial viral genomes were determined using Swaap Genome
Search version 1.0.1 [42]. A collection of 77 bacteriophages, for which hosts have been well described, were
used for analysis of known viruses (Additional file 1).
Each viral genome was assessed by GSPC using a microbial database, and results in accordance with their known
hosts were determined. The percentage of viruses identified by Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, and
Genus of their known hosts were then determined.

For analysis of known viruses with the viral database, fragments rather than full-length viral genomes were used.
Random bacteriophage and viral genomic fragments were
generated because the viral database contains all known
fully sequenced viruses, including the 77 bacteriophages
used in our dataset. Random bacteriophage fragments of
sizes 10,000 nucleotides, 5,000 nucleotides, and 2,000
nucleotides were generated using Swaap Genome Search
1.0.1 [42]. Five random fragments for each specified size
were generated for each genome, and each was subjected
to GSPC using a viral database. The percentage of viruses
classified according to DNA type, virus type (bacteriophage or archaeal virus vs. eukaryotic virus), viral type
(Caudovirus vs. other phage type), viral Family, and viral
designation (e.g. T7-like viruses etc...) were then determined. The standard error was determined based on the
compilation of 5 separate experiments.
