Abstract
Hepatitis B virus DNA was extracted from serum of a chronic carrier and polymerase chain reaction was performed on
S gene. Direct sequencing showed a variant HBsAg with additional 4-amino acid insertion, and clone sequencing
confirmed the mixture of variant HBsAg and wildtype HBsAg. Of 16 clones with 12-nucleotide insertion, 15 clones had
identical AGAACAACACAA insertion between nucleotide 494 and nucleotide 495, and one clone had GGAACAACTCAA
insertion in the same position plus 3-nucleotide deletion from nucleotide 491 to nucleotide 493. S114T, C121Y, T126S/
A, Q129K, G130R, T131N, M133T, G145R, N146D substitution and premature stop codon were also found in those
clones. However, the origin of HBV with 4-amino acid insertion in HBsAg was unclear.
Introduction
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a global health problem. It was estimated that more than 2 billion of the
global population had been infected. Of these, approximately 360 million were chronically infected and estimated 500 000-700 000 people died from complications
of infection each year worldwide [1]. HBV infection was
highly endemic in China, a national serosurvey conducted in 2006 showed 7.2% surface antigen(HBsAg)
prevalence in population aged 1~59 years old [2]. Control
and therapy of HBV-related diseases weighed great burden on both government and infected individual [3].
HBsAg, a main serological marker for diagnosis of HBV
infection, comprises 226 amino acids(aa), and contains a
highly conformational epitope cluster in major hydrophilic region(MHR) extending from aa99-aa169, where
common α determinant is located at aa124-aa147 [4-6].
Antibodies induced by natural infection or by administration of vaccine direct against α determinant and confer
cross-protective immunity to all subtype [7-9]. However,
aa substitution, insertion or deletion in MHR may cause
the loss of conformational epitope and altered antigenicity of HBsAg, renders HBsAg undetectable, or induces
immune escape variants to evade virus clearance [10-17].
In this study we reported a novel 12-nucleotide(nt) insertion between nt494 and nt495 in S gene, which led 4-aa

insertion between aa113 and aa114 compared with wildtype HBsAg.

Materials and methods
Sample selection and serological assay

HBV chronic carriers were identified in 2 counties(districts) of Sichuan province by serological assay and epidemiological investigation in a subnational sampling
serosurvey. Partial sequence analysis of S gene was carried out for total 50 sera [18]. The serum 06A26 was
selected in this study because it presented aa insertion in
MHR by partial S gene sequencing.
Blood sample was drawn from a 77-year-old male
patient. Serological assays were positive for HBsAg,
HBeAg and anti-HBc, negative for anti-HBs and antiHBe with available commercial ELISA kit(Wantai,
China).
PCR and sequencing

HBV DNA was extracted from serum with QIAamp DNA
Mini Kit(QIAGEN, Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. Primer pair(S006-sense, 5'-CCTGCTGGTGGCTCCAGTTC-3', postion 56-75; S007antisense, 5'-CCAATTACATATCCCATGAA-3', position
893-874) were used to amplify complete fragment of S
gene with Taq PCR Master Mix Kit(QIAGEN, Germany)
[14]. PCR was performed for 40 cycles, each cycle
included denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec, annealing at
55°C for 1 min, and extension at 68°C for 2 min, with initial denaturing step at 94°C for 3 min and final amplifica-

tion step at 68°C for 10 min. PCR amplicon was purified
with Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-up System(Promega,
USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. Cycle
sequencing reaction was performed bidirectionally with
same S006 and S007 primers using Bigdye Terminator
v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit(Applied Biosystems, USA).
After purification with Sephadex G-50 Fine (Amersham,
Sweden), sequencing products were analyzed on ABI
PRISM 3130 Genetic Analyzer(Applied Biosystems,
Japan).
PCR Amplicon of 06A26 was also cloned into PMD18T Vector(TakaRa, China), transformed into E. coli Electro-Cell DH5α(TakaRa, China) and then sequenced.
S gene sequence of 06A26 PCR amplicon and 20 clones
were deposited in GenBank under accession number
GU145104 and GU358454-GU358473, respectively.
Quantitation of serum HBV DNA

The amount of serum HBV DNA was measured 1.6 × 105
copies/mL on the basis of calculation from standard
curve with commercial quantitative realtime PCR
kit(Da'an, China) on 7300 Real Time PCR System(Applied Biosystems, Singapore).

Results
Nucleotide analysis of S gene

Alignment of nt sequences in S gene of 06A26 PCR amplicon and 20 clones with genotype A-H reference isolates
showed a 12-nt insertion between nt494 and nt495 in
PCR amplicon and clone1-clon16. Of 16 clones with 12nt insertion, 15 clones showed identical insertion
sequence, AGAACAACACAA. Another clone showed
otherwise insertion sequence, GGAACAACTCAA, and
contained a 3-nt(TCA) deletion from nt491 to nt493(figure 1). Phylogenetic analysis by Mega3.1 software indicated they belonged to genotype B.
Amino acid sequence analysis of HBsAg

aa sequences were deduced from S gene DNA sequences
of 20 clones. Lys122, Lys160 and Pro127 indicated they
belonged to subtype adw2.
Compared with consensus sequence of Chinese isolates
retrieved from GenBank with same genotype/subtype,
clone1-clone11 and clone13-clone15 had KNNT insertion, clone12 ENNT insertion and clone16 RNNS insertion between aa113 and aa114, respectively. In addition,
clone16 contained a deletion at aa113. N146D substitution(AAC®GAC) occurred in clone5-clon6 at aa146,
leading to loss of N-linked glycosylation site at this position. S114T substitution(TCA®ACA) occurred in all
clones with 4-aa insertion. This 4-aa insertion alone or
plus following aa114 substitution might form a possible
N-linked glycosylation site. Of 4 clones with wildtype
HBsAg, T131N(ACC®AAC) and M133T(ATG®ACG)

Page 2 of 5

substitution occurred in clon17-clone19, also forming a
possible N-Linked glycosylation site(figure 2).
C121Y(TGC®TAC), T126S/T126A(ACT®TCT or
ACT®GCT), Q129K(CAA®AAA), G130R(GGA®
AGA), G145R(GGA®AGA) and other aa substitution
compared with consensus sequence in MHR were also
showed in figure 2. Premature stop codon occurred in
clone13 at aa156 (TGG®TAG), aa191 (TGG®TGA) and
aa196(TGG®TGA), in clone14 at aa206 (TAC®TAG)
and in clone15 at aa223 (TGG®TGA), respectively.

Discussion
Carman proposed to separate MHR into functional areas
HBs1-HBs5 [19], which relate to antigenic effect of variants and their selective pressures. Since Yamamoto first
reported 8-aa insertion between aa123 and aa124 in S
gene [14], aa insertion/deletion in HBsAg had been
reported in following studies, they included 2-aa insertion between aa122 and aa123 [15,16], 3-aa insertion
between aa123 and aa124 [16], 1-aa insertion between
aa121 and aa122 [20], 3-aa insertion between aa118 and
aa119 [18], 2-aa deletion from aa110 to aa111 [17], 4-aa
deletion from aa119 to aa122 [17], 3-aa deletion from
aa113 to aa115 [21]. Those insertion/deletion were
located into HBs1-HBs2, so both HBs1 and HBs2 were
hot spots for aa insertion/deletion [5,16,17]. Recently,
Zhou reported 5-aa insertion between aa128 and aa129
[22], which located into HBs3(also in first loop of α determinant). As sequencing data accumulate, more aa insertion/deletion in HBsAg may be found.
HBsAg was detectable in serum of the patient in this
study, despite 4-aa insertion between aa113 and aa114,
compared with HBsAg negative sera described previously
[14,16,17,22]. Of note, HBsAg with 1-aa insertion behind
aa113 in a serum was reported to be detectable only at
low dilution(5 times), while HBsAg without aa insertion
in other sera was detectable at high dilution(at least 16
000 times) [23]. So PCR amplicon was cloned to find coexistence of wildtype HBsAg that might contribute to
HBsAg detection. Clone sequencing confirmed the mixture of variant HBsAg and wildtype HBsAg. High level of
serum DNA viral load(>1 × 105 copies/mL) and 20% of
wildtype HBsAg ensured HBsAg detection [16,24]. Other
experiment such as site-directed mutangenesis is needed
to confirm whether this 4-aa insertion alone or plus following aa114 substitution will alter HBsAg antigenicity
and affect the binding capacity of anti-HBsAg [25,26].
Due to overlapping of S gene with P gene, variation in S
gene may affect catalytic activity of reverse transcriptase(rt) domain in P gene and vice versa [27].
Deduced rt sequences were also analyzed. 12-nt insertion
caused 4-aa insertion(KEQH, REQH, KEQL, respectively) between rt121 and rt122 in clone1-clone16, and
another deletion at rt121 in clone16. Those insertion/

deletion were located in junction between conserved
region A and B [28]. No premature stop codon occurred
in corresponding rt domain. Some reported drug-resistant mutants, such as rtF166L and rtP177L [28], were
found in clone18 and clone15, respectively, and rtD205N
mutant(creating premature stop codon at aa196 in overlapping HBsAg) in clone13 led to change from YMDD
motif to YMND motif. However, high level of HBV DNA
rival load suggested this 4-aa insertion in rt domain was
less likely to be strong suppression of viral replication
[11,29].
PCR and direct sequencing on PreS1/S2 gene were also
performed, no insertion/deletion was found [14].
The origin of variant HBsAg was unclear. The patient
had no history of vaccination, therapy with interferon-α/
nucleoside analogues, administration of hepatitis B
immune globulin and blood transfusion. Knowing of his
infection status more than thirty years, the patient took
traditional Chinese medicine available for a long time.
Traditional Chinese medicine has been proven economi-

cal and efficient in liver protection and treatment, and
has less side effects compared with interferon α and lamivudine [30,31]. However, "Medicine is partly poisonous",
according to traditional Chinese medicine theory, they
may have unknown side effects, due to complex ingredients usually used in the formulas. Though anti-HBsAg
was negative in the patient serum, it might be existent
under detection limit for applied method. If more sensitive methods were applied, anti-HBsAg could been
detected in nearly all patients with chronic hepatitis B
infection [32,33]. It was possibility that the patient first
infected wildtype HBV, host immunity responded to
HBV infection but failed to clear virus. Selective pressure
from host immunity, traditional Chinese medicine and
other factors in combination favored the replication of
variant HBV with 4-aa insertion in HBsAg and outnumbered wildtype HBV.
In summary, we reported a novel 12-nt insertion in S
gene of HBV, which led to 4-aa insertion in HBsAg
between aa113 and aa114, but the origin of the variant

isolates with genotype B/subtype adw2(GenBank accession number AB033554, AF100309, D00329, AF397207, EU305547, EU589335 and
GU145102). One-letter code was used for amino acid in consensus sequence, homologous amino acids were indicated with dots, deleted amino acid
with dash, and premature stop codon with asterisk. Heterologous amino acids were specified. Inserted amino acids were indicated with grey boxes.

HBV was unclear. A well-documented immune escape
mutant G145R in one clone, might occur naturally due to
lack of proof-reading activity of rt domain and exist as
quasi-species viral population [34,35].
