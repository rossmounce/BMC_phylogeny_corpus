Abstract
Background: The globe artichoke (Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus L.) is a significant crop in the
Mediterranean basin. Despite its commercial importance and its both dietary and pharmaceutical
value, knowledge of its genetics and genomics remains scant. Microsatellite markers have become
a key tool in genetic and genomic analysis, and we have exploited recently acquired EST (expressed
sequence tag) sequence data (Composite Genome Project - CGP) to develop an extensive set of
microsatellite markers.
Results: A unigene assembly was created from over 36,000 globe artichoke EST sequences,
containing 6,621 contigs and 12,434 singletons. Over 12,000 of these unigenes were functionally
assigned on the basis of homology with Arabidopsis thaliana reference proteins. A total of 4,219
perfect repeats, located within 3,308 unigenes was identified and the gene ontology (GO) analysis
highlighted some GO term's enrichments among different classes of microsatellites with respect to
their position. Sufficient flanking sequence was available to enable the design of primers to amplify
2,311 of these microsatellites, and a set of 300 was tested against a DNA panel derived from 28 C.
cardunculus genotypes. Consistent amplification and polymorphism was obtained from 236 of these
assays. Their polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.04 to 0.90 (mean 0.66).
Between 176 and 198 of the assays were informative in at least one of the three available mapping
populations.
Conclusion: EST-based microsatellites have provided a large set of de novo genetic markers, which
show significant amounts of polymorphism both between and within the three taxa of C.
cardunculus. They are thus well suited as assays for phylogenetic analysis, the construction of genetic
maps, marker-assisted breeding, transcript mapping and other genomic applications in the species.

Background
The globe artichoke Cynara cardunculus is a member of the
Asteraceae (Compositae) family, and originates from the

Mediterranean basin [1]. The species is subdivided into
three taxa - the globe artichoke (var. scolymus L.), the cultivated cardoon (var. altilis DC), and their progenitor, the

wild cardoon [var. sylvestris (Lamk) Fiori]. The edible part
of the globe artichoke plant is provided by its immature
inflorescence, referred as a capitulum or head [2], and represents a significant component of the Mediterranean
diet. The cultivated cardoon is grown for its fleshy stems,
which are used in traditional cuisine. Leaf extracts of the
species contain a number of bioactive compounds (e.g.,
quercetin, rutin, luteolin, gallic acid, di-caffeoylchinic
acid, and sesquiterpene lactones) which have been shown
to have anti-oxidative and anti-carcinogenic activity, to
inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis, and to enhance lipid
metabolism [3-8]. The antioxidant content per serving of
globe artichoke ranks very highly among vegetables [9],
while the roots provide a source of inulin, a proven
enhancer of human intestinal flora [10,11]. In spite of its
economic importance, however, little breeding effort has
been applied to date in the globe artichoke.
Progress has been made in the development of DNA
marker based genetic maps in globe artichoke [12-14].
The most saturated map has been recently developed from
a set of F1 progeny of a cross between a globe artichoke
and a cultivated cardoon genotypes [14]. This map consisted of 20 linkage groups comprising 326 loci and
spanned ~1500 cM with a mean inter-marker distance of
~4.5 cM. A set of loci common to this map and a previously developed one [12] allowed for map alignment and
the definition of 17 homologous linkage groups, corresponding to the haploid chromosome number of the species.

a particular gene ontology term.

Results and Discussion
EST microsatellite discovery, frequency and primer design
Globe artichoke ESTs were trimmed, assembled, and
annotated using a customized bioinformatic pipeline
(Figure 1) into 19,055 unigenes (6,621 contigs and
12,434 singletons) spanning 15 Mbp. The transcript
assembly and unigene consensus sequences are supplied
as electronic supplementary materials (See Additional file
1, 2, 3: EST assembly, 19,055 unigenes, ACE assembly
file). The unigenes had a mean length of 786 ± 1.7 bp,
with a mean GC content of 43.9 ± 0.03% (range 24.7 67.9%, Figure 2) and a mean ambiguity code ratio of 0.51
± 0.01. Within the unigene set, 3,308 contained 4,219
uninterrupted tracts of (perfect) di-, tri-, tetra-, penta-, and
hexa-nucleotide repeats, delivering a mean microsatellite
density of one per 3.6 kb. Comparable microsatellite frequencies and densities have been discovered in the transcriptomes of other Compositae species [16-18]. Only
perfect repeats were selected, as these appear to be the
more prone to strand slippage and, consequently, tend to

It was long assumed that SSRs were primarily associated
with non-coding DNA, but it has now become clear that
they are more frequent in transcribed than non-transcribed sequences and equally frequent in the transcriptomes of plants with dramatically different nuclear DNA
contents [15]. EST databases therefore represent a convenient resource for the identification of microsatellites,
some of which, as a result of their presence within coding
DNA, have the potential to deliver informative within
gene markers, exploitable as COS (conserved orthologous
set) for genomic comparative analysis.
Here, we report: i) the unigene assembly based on the
globe artichoke EST database deposited in GenBank by
the Compositae Genome Project (CGP), ii) the identification of a wide set of EST-based microsatellite markers and
iii) the evaluation of the informativeness of a subset of
these markers using a panel of C. cardunculus genotypes.
Furthermore, we performed a comprehensive functional
annotation, inferred from sequence alignment (ISA), as
well as a gene ontology categorisation inferred from
sequence orthology (ISO) of the SSR-containing unigenes. At last we assessed whether motif type and relative
position within CDSs (Coding DNA Sequences)/UTRs

be more polymorphic than interrupted ones [19]. Sufficient flanking sequence (in terms of both length and read
quality) was present in 1,974 of the unigenes, containing
2,311 perfect microsatellites. The resulting PCR primers
designed for these loci are given in Additional File 4
(primer pairs designed).
Allelic diversity with the EST microsatellites
A subset of 300 microsatellites (ranging in length from 10
to 84 bp, and representative of a broad spectrum of the
repeat types) was surveyed for their informativeness. The
targeted amplicon length ranged from 98 to 456 bp and
the set was selected to optimize the possibility of multiplexing on the capillary genotyping platform employed.
The test germplasm panel consisted of twelve genotypes of
globe artichoke, nine of cultivated cardoon, and seven of
wild cardoon (Table 1). In all, 238 (79.3%) of the assays
were successful; of these, 236 were informative among the
taxa, while 215, 216 and 223 were polymorphic within,
respectively, globe artichoke, cultivated cardoon and wild

cardoon (Table 2 and Additional file 5: full statistics on
300 SSR-containing loci). A total of 1,546 alleles was generated from the 238 successful assays, giving a mean of 3.8
(range 1-15) alleles per locus. The largest range in amplicon length observed was 196 - 252 bp, observed for a
TCAn microsatellite (CyEM-171). In 85% of the loci, the
assay generated the predicted length of amplicon, in
12.2% the amplicon was longer than expected, and in
2.8% it was shorter. The allelic range (in terms of amplicon length) was greater for the wild cardoon (17.1 ± 1.0
bp) than for globe artichoke (13.6 ± 0.8 bp) or cultivated
cardoon (13.7 ± 0.7 bp).
Allelic diversity was, as expected given the breeding history of these taxa [2,20,21], greater in the wild than in the
two cultivated forms (Figure 3A). The frequency of taxonspecific alleles was two fold more in the wild cardoon, and
the polymorphic information content (PIC) was higher in
the wild cardoon (0.576 ± 0.015) than in either the globe
artichoke (0.484 ± 0.013) or the cultivated cardoon

The 28 C. cardunculus accessions assayed for genotypic variation.
Respectively 12 globe artichokes, 9 cultivated cardoons and 7 wild
cardoons were analysed.1Globe artichoke, cultivated cardoon and
wild cardoon clusters defined in [20,21,26], respectively.

(0.466 ± 0.015). The observed heterozygosity level (Ho)
was significantly less in the cultivated cardoon than in
globe artichoke, presumably because the globe artichoke
is primarily a vegetatively propagated plant, and thus able
to maintain a high level of heterozygosity over time
[20,21]; whereas cultivated cardoon is seed propagated
and has been subjected to purifying selection aimed at
increasing genetic uniformity for stabilizing its production. We previously developed three mapping population
for the development of C. cardunculus genetic maps by
crossing one globe artichoke non spiny genotype (common female parent) with a spiny genotype of globe artichoke or cultivated cardoon or wild cardoon. When the
parents of the three mapping populations were tested
with the set of microsatellites, 214 were informative in at
least one combination, while 153 across all the three combinations, thus supplying landmarks for comparative
mapping of phenotypic and quantitative trait loci (QTLs).
As expected, the most polymorphic combination (198
microsatellites) was the one involving the cross between

the most genetically divergent taxa: globe artichoke and
wild cardoon (Figure 3B).
Diversity analysis
The informativeness of the newly developed EST microsatellites was comparable with that described for microsatellite markers in globe artichoke [13,22], sunflower
[23,24] and lettuce [25]. A set of five EST microsatellites
was sufficient to discriminate between each of the 28
members of the germplasm panel (e.g. CyEM-10, -37, -54,
-105, -254). The inferred genetic relationships were in
good concordance with those derived from AFLP profiling
[20,21,26,27]. Thus, the globe artichoke accessions clustered with one another (Figure 4A, cluster A), but two subclusters, corresponding to the contrasting capitulum types
(i.e. non spiny vs. violet, spiny types), could be recognised. The clade most closely related to the globe artichokes contained the cultivated cardoons (Figure 4A,
cluster B), and among these, the most well differentiated
accession was 'Bianco Pieno Migliorato', as previously
observed [21]. The Spanish cultivated cardoon accessions
were genetically very similar to one another. The wild cardoon accessions formed a discrete, but rather loose group
(Figure 4A, cluster C). A principal co-ordinate analysis further illustrated the genetic relationships between members of the germplasm panel (Figure 4B). Axes 1 and 2
accounted for ~ 73% of the genetic variation, the former
contributing ~ 47%, and the latter ~ 26%. Axis 1 distinguished the globe artichokes from the cultivated and wild
cardoons, while Axis 2 separated the two cardoon taxa. As
expected, F1 progenies mapped to intermediate positions
with respect to those of their parents (Figure 4B).
Distribution of microsatellite
Of the 4,219 microsatellites, trinucleotide motifs
accounted for 49%, dinucleotides for 33%, hexanucleotides for 13%, tetranucleotides for 3% and pentanucleotides for 2% (Figure 5). Only ESTs (2,498 of the 3,308)
having a non-ambiguous ortholog in Arabidopsis thaliana
were taken forward for the purpose of annotation. The
position of the microsatellite tract (5'-UTR or 3'-UTR or
CDS) was derived from the BlastX result in conjunction
with the ORF (Open Reading Frame)-Predictor algorithm
[28]. About 33% of the microsatellites were present in the
5'-UTRs, ~ 20% in the 3'-UTRs and ~ 47% in the CDSs
(Figure 5), similar to the relative frequencies in both the
A. thaliana and rice genomes [15]. Most of the CDS microsatellites consisted of trinucleotides, while dinucleotides were the most abundant in the 5'-UTRs, and di- and
trinucleotides were equally represented in the 3'-UTRs.
Tetra- and pentanucleotide motifs were more frequent in
the 3'-UTRs than in either the CDSs or the 5'-UTRs (data
not shown). Trinucleotide (and hexanucleotide) motifs
are expected to predominate in the population of CDS
microsatellites, as variation in their repeat number is not

Main information reported: locus name, unigene (for contigs-derived loci)/Accession number (for singletons-derived loci), expected size, perfect
microsatellite motif, number of repeats, observed alleles range, number of observed alleles (no), effective alleles (ne), observed heterozygosity (Ho),
polymorphic information content (PIC) and mapping utility for the three progenies ["Romanesco C3" × "Spinoso di Palermo" (GxG), "Romanesco
C3" × "altilis41" (GxC) and "Romanesco C3" × "Creta-4" (GxW)]. Additional information are available in the electronic supplementary material. *Data
showing a multi-locus amplification were excluded from the analysis.

Allelic diversity revealed by the set of EST microsatellite markers
Allelic diversity revealed by the set of EST microsatellite markers. (A) Allelic patterns and the level of heterozygosity
within each taxon. Observed (no), effective (ne) and the number of taxon-specific alleles per marker are represented by bars.
PIC and Ho are indicated by points. (B) Markers showing segregation within the three mapping populations. GxG: within scolymus, GxC: scolymus × altilis, GxW: scolymus × sylvestris.

associated with a frame shift event [29]. The most abundant dinucleotide repeat was AG/CT, followed by AC/GT,
although AT/TA predominated in the 3'-UTRs. Among the
trinucleotides, the most frequent was AAG/CTT, followed
by ATC/GAT and CAC/GTG (Figure 6). This distribution is
consistent with the situation in A. thaliana and Brassica
spp. orthologs, in which a preference for AG/CT and AAG/
CTT motifs has been identified in the 5'-UTRs, thought to
be associated with the cis-acting regulation of transcription [30]. In the globe artichoke 5' UTRs, dinucleotide
motifs were over-represented, with AG/CT being the most
abundant (Figure 6), similar to the situation in the 5'UTRs of many plant (both mono- and dicotyledonous
species) genes [31,32], which has been reported to play a
role in post-transcriptional gene regulation at the RNA
level [33,34]. Dinucleotide motifs were also frequent in
the 3'-UTRs, possibly because AT-rich elements are able to
act as cis mediators of mRNA turnover [33]. Overall,
present data confirm that homopurine/homopyrimidine
repeats contribute markedly in 5'-UTR and CDS, as previously reported by Morgante et al [15].
The function of genes containing microsatellites
Microsatellites within coding sequences can have a major
effect on gene activity, since the expansion/contraction of
triplets within the coding sequence alters the gene product, thereby sometimes causing a significant phenotypic
change. In humans, the effects on phenotype due to the
presence of SSRs in coding regions of genes playing key
roles in neuronal disorders and cancer have been extensively studied [35]. Among the microsatellites in the globe

artichoke transcriptome, the six most frequent amino acid
stretches present in the CDS were poly-serine (94 unigenes), poly-aspartic acid (75 unigenes), poly-glutamic
acid (57 unigenes), poly-lysine (46 unigenes), poly-glycine (45 unigenes) and poly-threonine (35 unigenes). It
has been reported that particular amino acid repeats tend
to be associated with specific classes of proteins [36].
Acidic and polar amino acid repeats have generally been
associated with transcription factors and protein kinases,
whereas serine repeats are common within membrane
transporter proteins [37]. In the globe artichoke, poly-serine and poly-glycine stretches are particularly frequent in
the CDS. Poly-serine linkers are common in eukaryotic
genomes, and are thought to provide a flexible interdomain. They are frequently associated with modular proteins, and are involved in complex carbohydrate
degradation [38] and the binding of proteins with extracellular matrix components, such as the laminin binding
protein. Poly-glycine (also poly-asparagine and poly-proline) microsatellites may provide a domain for DNA binding or protein-protein interactions, and has been found to
be necessary for chloroplast envelope targeting. Polyglutamic and poly-aspartic acid tracts feature in many NLS
(nuclear localisation signal) proteins [39], and it has been
suggested that both basic karyophilic and acidic clusters
can enhance their selective binding to transport machinery components [40]. Poly-glutamic acid stretches have
also been implicated in transcription activation/de-activation [41-45], and microsatellite allelic variants of these
genes have been identified as the genetic basis of a
number of human diseases [46].

Position and motifs of EST microsatellites. (A) Distribution within specific regions of the unigenes. (B) Frequencies of
repeat motifs within the unigene set.

To support the occurrence of certain repeated motifs in
the assembled unigenes we have exploited sequence alignment and gene ontology in order to annotate their functions and assess whether their motif type and position are
preferentially associated with a particular gene ontology
term.
In preparation, the set of globe artichoke unigenes was filtered to include only those with a BlastX E-value of < 1e29 when matched with the A. thaliana reference protein set.
In all, 12,783 queries satisfied this criterion (Additional

rize the unigenes using TAIR gene ontology (data not
shown). The GoStat2 web interface was then used to identify gene ontology categories which were over-represented. By comparing either the set of microsatellitecontaining unigenes, or subsets of it (e.g.: genes including
di- or trinucleotide motifs in their CDS or UTRs) with the
complete set of annotated unigenes, it was possible to
identify over-representation in gene ontology (GO) categories (Table 3). Microsatellites appeared to be over-represented in loci involved in certain biological processes
and functions, while no significant association was found
with GO cell components (data not shown).
Most of the unigenes containing trinucleotide motifs in
their CDS were associated with nucleic acid metabolic
processes (GO:0006139), transcription (GO:0006350)
and the regulation of transcription (GO:0006355), consistent with the encoding by the GAT trinucleotide of
aspartic acid, since stretches of this residue are characteristic of 'karyophilic' acidic clusters in NLS (nuclear localization signal) proteins. Similarly, the AAG/TTC motif,
which occurred frequently in the CDS, encodes polyglutamate, which is thought to be involved in both protein-DNA complex assembly (GO:0065004) and heterocyclic metabolic processes (GO:0046483). Unigenes
carrying dinucleotide motifs in their CDS were found to
be specifically associated with the response to stimulus
(GO:0050896). The AG/CT repeats in the CDSs were overrepresented among genes responding to stress
(GO:0006950), involved in DNA repair (GO:0006281)
and in nucleic acid binding (GO:0003676). This is con-

GO terms statistically enriched (showed in percentage) for specific SSRs subsets. Fisher's exact test was performed between each SSRs subset versus the whole unigenes categorization; only
significant over-represented subset are reported (p < 0,01). Analysis is displayed referring to "biological process" and "molecular function" classifications; "cellular component" is not reported due
to the absence of particular enriched subsets.

sistent with the presence of domains involved in proteinRNA/protein-protein sticky interactions.
The commonest microsatellite motifs occurring in 5'-UTR
of unigenes were dinucleotide repeats (mostly AG/CT).
These unigenes were associated with nucleic acid metabolism (GO:0006139), the regulation of gene expression
(GO:0010468), transcription (GO:0006350) and the regulation of transcription (GO:0006355). AG/CT repeats
were also over-represented in genes involved in the
response to ABA (GO:0009737 and GO:0009738). Moreover, trans-acting elements (GO:0003700: "transcription
factor activity"), which show an over-representation of trinucleotidic (ATC/GAT) in their CDSs, were also frequently enriched in their 5'UTRs by AG/CT motifs,
suggesting a cascade of signal transmission. Trinucleotide
motifs were not common in the 5'-UTRs, except in genes
involved in the response to auxin stimulus
(GO:0009733).

Conclusion
We have demonstrated here the utility of a set of de novo
globe artichoke EST-based microsatellite markers for the
definition of genetic diversity, phylogeny and genetic
mapping. Since EST microsatellites lie within expressed
sequences, they have the potential to represent perfect
markers for genes underlying phenotypic variation. Most
of these assays are fully transferable to other C. cardunculus
taxa, providing anchor points for the integration of taxonspecific genetic maps. The functional annotation of these
EST sequences increases their utility as a source of genebased markers for the study of synteny and other applications.

Methods
EST microsatellites discovery and primer design
A collection of 36,321 EST, generated from the 'Green
Globe' variety of C. cardunculus var. scolymus, as part of the
output of the Compositae Genome Project http://compg
enomics.ucdavis.edu, was downloaded from the NCBI
database http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. To generate a set
of unique assemblies, the sequences were first trimmed to
remove any remaining vector fragments and polyA tails,
using the perl script SeqCleaner, and assembled adopting
a second perl script, TGICL, employing the following
parameters: p = 95 (identity percentage), l = 40 (minimum overlap length), v = 10 (maximum length of
unmatched overhangs); the maximum mismatch overhang was set to 10 bp, since the sequences had already
been purged of vector stretches and polyA tails. The two
scripts are available at http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/
tgi/software. The unigene set was then searched for perfect
microsatellite sequences using a modified SSRIT perl
script [47], with the minimum number of dinucleotides
set as five, of tri-, tetra- and penta-nucleotides set as four,
and of hexanucleotides as three. A sample of 300 non

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/454

redundant microsatellite-containing sequences, selected
to include the longer microsatellite motifs, was taken forward for PCR screening. Primer design was carried out
using
BatchPrimer3
http://probes.pw.usda.gov/
batchprimer with an optimal GC content of 50%, a maximum melting temperature difference of 3°C, variable
amplicon size (to allow multiplexing), and all other
parameters set to default values. The de novo microsatellite
markers were prefixed with 'CyEM' (Cynara Expressed
Microsatellite) and numbered sequentially.
Plant materials and genomic DNA isolation
DNA was extracted from young leaves following a modified CTAB method [48]. The primers were used to amplify
genomic DNA template extracted from a germplasm panel
consisting of twelve globe artichoke genotypes, representative of crops grown in the Mediterranean Basin [20]; nine
cultivated cardoon genotypes, representative of both the
Spanish and Italian gene pools [21]; and seven wild cardoon genotypes sampled from both Sicily and Sardinia
[26]. Full genotypes details are reported in Table 1. The set
also included DNA of the four parents of three established
mapping populations, i.e. two globe artichoke accessions
['Romanesco C3' (C3) and 'Spinoso di Palermo' (SP)],
one cultivated cardoon ('Altilis 41') and one wild cardoon
('Creta 4'); furthermore six F1 individuals from each of
the segregating populations (C3 × SP, C3 × Altilis 41 and
C3 × Creta 4) were included in the analyses.
Genotyping and diversity analysis
Primer pairs CyEM-001 to CyEM-300 (Additional file 4:
primer pairs designed) were tested for their informativeness on the germplasm panel. Amplification was carried
out in 10 μl reactions containing 7 ng template DNA, 1×
PCR Buffer (Qiagen Inc., Venlo, Netherlands), 1.0 mM
MgCl2, 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen), 40 nM 5'labelled (FAM, HEX or TAMRA) forward primer, 40 nM
unlabelled reverse primer and 0.2 mM dNTPs. A touchdown cycling regime was applied, consisting of 1 cycle at
94°C for 150 sec, 9 cycles at 94°C for 30 sec, 63°C for 30
sec (-0,7°C/cycle) and 72°C for 60 sec, then 30 cycles at
94°C for 30 sec, 57°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 60 sec, followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5 min.

Weakly amplified reactions were re-run using 1.5 mM
MgCl2 and applying a final annealing temperature of
55°C. Amplicons were separated on an ABI3730 capillary
DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystem Inc., Foster City, CA,
USA). Internal ROX-labelled GS500 size standards were
included in each capillary. Fragment data were analysed
using GeneMapper v3.5 software (Applied Biosystems).
The genotypic data were analysed using the GenAlex Excel
package [49]. Genetic diversity was calculated separately
for the globe artichoke, cultivated cardoon and wild cardoon genotypes on the basis of (1) the mean number of
alleles observed per locus (no), (2) the effective number of

alleles per locus (ne) as predicted by 1/Σpi2 where pi is the
frequency of the ith allele at the locus, (3) the mean
observed heterozygosity (Ho), and (4) the polymorphic
information content (PIC), estimated following [49]. A
co-phenetic distance matrix for co-dominant markers was
generated as described by Smouse and Peakall [50] and
used to construct a UPGMA-based dendrogram [51] by
means of NTSYS software package v2.10 [52]. Principal
co-ordinate analysis was based on the distance matrix,
with data standardization provided by the GenAlex package.
Annotation of the unigene set
The unigene set was aligned by a BlastX [53] search against
the A. thaliana reference proteins database (NCBI), applying an E-value threshold of e-29. The location within the
gene sequence of the microsatellite (5'-UTR, CDS or 3'UTR) was inferred from this alignment, while ORF-Predictor [28] was used to predict the position of the stop
codon. The frequencies of peptide repeat tracts within the
CDS were used to identify any over-representation of particular triplets. For this purpose, the unigenes were
divided into ten subgroups on the basis of the identity of
the trinucleotide motif present in the CDS. Each subgroup
was then subjected to an analysis based on the ORF-Predictor algorithm, considering only the positive reading
frames (+1, +2, +3), since the sequenced transcripts were
originally directionally cloned. All the unigenes were
assigned a function based on the GeneOntology tool
http://www.arabidopsis.org, using the A. thaliana
orthologs (from BlastX output) as input (using AGI codes
from TAIR). Enrichment within the GO hierarchical levels
by mean of different subset of unigenes was estimated
using the GoStat2 interface http://gostat.wehi.edu.au/cgibin/goStat2.pl based on Fisher's exact test [54], adopting
a threshold p-value of 0.01 and considering terms starting
from the 3rd hierarchical level of the DAG (directed acyclic graph; Table 3).
