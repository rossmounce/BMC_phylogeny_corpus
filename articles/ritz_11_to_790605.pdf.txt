To be or not to be the odd one out - Allelespecific transcription in pentaploid dogroses
(Rosa L. sect. Caninae (DC.) Ser)

Abstract
Background: Multiple hybridization events gave rise to pentaploid dogroses which can reproduce sexually despite
their uneven ploidy level by the unique canina meiosis. Two homologous chromosome sets are involved in
bivalent formation and are transmitted by the haploid pollen grains and the tetraploid egg cells. In addition the
egg cells contain three sets of univalent chromosomes which are excluded from recombination. In this study we
investigated whether differential behavior of chromosomes as bivalents or univalents is reflected by sequence
divergence or transcription intensity between homeologous alleles of two single copy genes (LEAFY, cGAPDH) and
one ribosomal DNA locus (nrITS).
Results: We detected a maximum number of four different alleles of all investigated loci in pentaploid dogroses
and identified the respective allele with two copies, which is presumably located on bivalent forming
chromosomes. For the alleles of the ribosomal DNA locus and cGAPDH only slight, if any, differential transcription
was determined, whereas the LEAFY alleles with one copy were found to be significantly stronger expressed than
the LEAFY allele with two copies. Moreover, we found for the three marker genes that all alleles have been under
similar regimes of purifying selection.
Conclusions: Analyses of both molecular sequence evolution and expression patterns did not support the
hypothesis that unique alleles probably located on non-recombining chromosomes are less functional than
duplicate alleles presumably located on recombining chromosomes.

Background
Polyploidisation is considered to be a major creative
force in plant evolution since approximately 70% of
angiosperm lineages underwent whole-genome duplications during their evolution [1]. In most cases genome
doubling comes along with interspecific hybridization
(allopolyploidy) and the genetic outcomes of these combined events are manifold and not easy to predict [1,2].
In principle the evolutionary fate of duplicated genes,
including homeologs generated by polyploidization, can
result in 1) the retention and co-expression of all copies,
2) loss or silencing of some copies (non-functionalisation), 3) development of complementary copy-specific
functions (sub-functionalisation) and 4) divergence

between copies leading to acquisition of new functions
(neo-functionalisation) [3,4]. In case of co-expression of
duplicated genes allopolyploids have to cope with negative effects of increased gene dosage, thus most genes
are expressed at mid-parent levels [5,6]. The potential
for reprogramming of genetic systems increases the
plasticity to react on changing environments, buffers the
effect of deleterious mutations and is probably responsible for the evolutionary success of polyploids [7]. A disadvantageous effect of polyploidy is the possible
disturbance of meiosis by doubled chromosomes which
may prevent correct bivalent formation [7]. However,
newly formed allopolyploids can maintain sexual reproduction in the majority of cases because stable bivalent
formation during meiosis is enhanced by the divergence
between homeologous chromosomes. Contrary, the
establishment of anorthoploid (odd ploidy) hybrids is
based on asexual reproduction, e. g. in Crepis L., Rubus

L. and Taraxacum F.H. Wigg [8]. Peculiar exceptions
among these anorthoploids are the mostly pentaploid
sexual European dogroses (Rosa L. sect. Caninae (DC.)
Ser.). Section Caninae originated by multiple hybridization events [9] and overcame the sterility bottleneck due
to odd ploidy by the development of a unique meiosis
mechanism regaining sexual reproduction [10-13]. This
meiotic system is unique in plants, but other meiosis
systems leading to comparable effects have been
observed e.g. in the sexual triploid plant Leucopogon
juniperinus R.Br. (Ericaceae) [8] and the triploid hybrid
fish Squalius alburnoides [14]. High ploidy levels and
sexuality have probably been the prerequisites for the
evolutionary success of dogroses after the retreat of
Pleistocenic ice shields, because dogroses are very widely
spread in Central Europe and occur on a broad range of
different habitats, whereas diploid and tetraploid species
of other sections of Rosa are mainly found in glacial
refugia [15].
The so-called canina-meiosis produces haploid pollen
grains (n = x = 7) and tetraploid egg cells (n = 4x = 28)
which merge to pentaploid zygotes (2n = 5x = 35; Figure 1). A very similar process is observed in tetraploid
dogroses (2n = 4x = 28), which form also haploid pollen
grains (n = x = 7) but triploid egg cells (n = 3x = 21).
Bivalent formation and thus recombination occurs
always between chromosomes of the same two highly
homologous sets, one transmitted by the pollen grain
and the other by the egg cell. The remaining chromosomes are exclusively transmitted by the egg cell and do

not undergo chromosome pairing [16-18]. Thus, caninameiosis unites intrinsically sexual reproduction (recombining bivalents) and apomixis (maternally transmitted
unrecombined univalents). Previous studies demonstrated that the number of different nuclear ribosomal
DNA families and microsatellite alleles was always lower
than the maximum number expected from ploidy level
of investigated plants, thus one allele is always present
in at least two identical copies [9,16-19]. Research on
artificial hybrids revealed that alleles with identical
copies are located on bivalent forming chromosomes
and refer probably to an extinct diploid Proto-Caninae
ancestor, whereas the copies located on univalents are
more diverged between each other [9,16,17,19]. Studying
expression patterns of rDNA loci within five different
dogrose species Khaitová et al. (2010) observed stable
expression patterns of rDNA families on bivalentforming genomes in contrast to frequent silencing of
rDNAs from univalent-forming genomes [20].
In this study we wanted to determine whether the differential behaviour of chromosomes during meiosis is
mirrored in gene divergence and expression patterns of
homeologs by the analysis of three marker genes in
Rosa canina L. Therefore, we analysed the extent of
molecular divergence between alleles of two single copy
genes: LEAFY and cytosolic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (cGAPDH); and between families of
nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers (nrITS-1).
LEAFY encodes a transcription factor which controls
floral meristem identity [21] and cGAPDH encodes an
essential enzyme of glycolysis. Nuclear ribosomal ITS is
part of the 18S-5.8S-26 S ribosomal DNA cluster, which
is organized in long tandem arrays in one nucleolus
organizer region (NOR) per genome in dogroses [22,23].
The apparent absence of interlocus homogenization
between NORs [19,24] allows tracking different dogrose
genomes by diagnostic ITS families [9,19,25]. The
sequence information obtained from the homeologs of
the three marker genes was then used for allele-specific
transcription analyses using pyrosequencing.

Results
Gene copy numbers

Figure 1 Diagram of canina meiosis. Dogroses with a pentaploid
somatic chromosome number (2n = 5x = 35) produce haploid
pollen grains (1n = 1x = 7) during microsporogenesis in the anthers
and tetraploid egg cells (1n = 4x = 28) during megasporogenesis in
the carpels. Fertilization of haploid pollen grains and tetraploid egg
cells restores the pentaploid somatic level of the next generation.
Bivalent forming chromosomes are presented in red, univalent
chromosomes are presented in white, grey and black.

Southern hybridizations were performed to estimate the
copy numbers of LEAFY and cGAPDH in Rosa canina
(additional file 1). One to three fragments were detected
in the digestions of genomic DNA by six different
enzymes hybridized against probes of LEAFY or
cGAPDH. The maximum number of three fragments
within the digestions did not contradict against the
expectation for LEAFY and cGAPDH to have one copy
per each dogrose genome, because we expected a maximum number of five bands in pentaploids. Variation in
the observed one to three bands result either from

within the range of the probe for some of the alleles or
from variation of the number of cutting sites between
dogrose genomes.
Allelic variation

We sequenced approximately 1990 bp of LEAFY in
seven individuals of Rosa canina; only the first about
50 bp downstream of the translation start codon and
the last about 50 bp upstream of the stop codon were
missing. We detected four different alleles of LEAFY
termed LEAFY-1, -2, -3 and -4 (Figure 2). We did not
sample the allele LEAFY-4 directly by cloning analysis in
the individuals H21, 194 and 378, but we detected it
with the help of PCR using LEAFY-4 -specific primers
(data not shown). Genomic sequences of alleles differed
between each other by 0.07% - 4.1%; their coding
sequences contained no premature stop codons and 29
amino acid substitutions in total (Table 1). The analysed
plants were pentaploid implying that one of the LEAFY
alleles had two copies, which was allele LEAFY-3 determined by pyrosequencing of an allele-specific single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in genomic DNA
(Figure 3).
We isolated approximately 2100 bp of the cGAPDH
sequence in five individuals of R. canina; only the first
about 120 bp downstream of the translation start
codon and the last about 120 bp upstream of the stop
codon were missing. We found four different alleles of
cGAPDH in individual H20 and three different alleles
in the other individuals (Figure 4). Using allele-specific
primers the allele cGAPDH-2 could be detected in all
individuals but the allele cGAPDH-4 only in individual
H20 (data not shown). Genomic sequences of alleles
were very similar to each other (0.08 - 2.42% sequence
divergence) and we detected only five amino acid substitutions and no premature stop codons in the coding
region (Table 1). Allele frequency determination of
genomic DNA indicated that allele cGAPDH-1 has
three copies in H13 and H19 and two copies in H20
(Figure 5).
We identified three different alleles of nrITS in the
plants H13 and H20 and four alleles in H19 (Figure 6).
The alleles Canina-1, Rugosa and Woodsii were identical
to sequences found in a previous study [9], but allele
Canina-2 was sampled for the first time. Whereas in
case of LEAFY and cGAPDH the same allele was present
in multiple copies in all plants we observed that the two
closely related alleles Canina-1 and Canina-2 (Figure 6)
had several copies. We determined three copies of the
Canina-1 allele in H13 and H20. We concluded from
base frequencies at the SNPs measured in the genomic
DNA samples of H19 that this individual had two copies
of the Canina-2 and one copy of the Canina-1 allele.

Page 3 of 14

However, base frequency at SNP 4 specific for the
Canina-1 and Canina-2 allele is higher (0.778) than
expected (0.6; Figure 7, additional file 2).
In all three marker genes we hardly observed any variation between sequences of one clade isolated from different individuals (referred as alleles, Figures 2, 4, 6).
Within the LEAFY-2 and LEAFY-3 clade sequences of
two individuals formed statistically supported sub-clades
(Figure 2). Sequences of LEAFY-3 H20 and H21 differed
from the remaining LEAFY-3 sequences by one substitution in intron 3; sequences of LEAFY-2 H19 and 378
differed by one synonymous substitution in the coding
region and three substitutions in the non-coding region.
Following a strict definition these sequences have to be
treated as different alleles. However, for pragmatic reasons we decided to summarize them as LEAFY-2 and
LEAFY-3 alleles, respectively, because sequences were
very closely related and the individuals contained only
one of the respective alleles. Tree topologies based on
genomic sequences (Figures 2, 4) were identical to those
based on coding regions only, but posterior probabilities
were higher using genomic sequences (data not shown).
In order to investigate the differential evolution between
alleles present in multiple copies and single copy alleles
we estimated the relative rate of substitutions between
different alleles of LEAFY and cGAPDH by Relative Rate
Test (RRT), but no pair of sequences rejected the null
hypothesis of equal branch lengths for all alleles (additional file 3). Selection analyses using codeml (PAML)
revealed that alleles of LEAFY and cGAPDH evolved
under purifying selection (Table 1). In both genes the
models assuming different selective regimes between
alleles with multiple copies and singly copy alleles were
not significantly better than the null hypothesis (same
selective regime for all alleles; data not shown).
Allele-specific transcription

We found five SNPs in the coding region of LEAFY,
three SNPs of cGAPDH and five SNPs of nrITS which
were specific for a certain allele and suitable for allele
frequency determination by pyrosequencing (additional
file 4). We compared the frequency of allele specific
bases between samples from cDNA pools and genomic
DNA to estimate the relative level of transcription for
each allele. Base frequencies obtained from genomic
DNA indicate the copy number of an allele and represent the null hypothesis (equal transcription for all
alleles with regard to their copy number). The frequency
of the allele-specific bases in cDNA-pools did not vary
between plants (with regard to the copy number of this
allele in a plant) and between small and large flower
buds (data not shown).
In LEAFY the frequency of the allele-specific bases of
all investigated SNPs differed significantly from the null

hypothesis (Figure 3, additional file 2). Transcription
level of the allele LEAFY-3 with two copies in all investigated plants was 2.3-fold lower, but transcription levels
of single copy alleles LEAFY-1 and LEAFY-4 was
approximately 2.9-fold higher than expected (Figure 3).
We could not estimate the transcription level of LEAFY2, because no suitable SNP was available.
Contrary to the results of LEAFY, transcription of
cGAPDH-1 with three copies in plants H13 and H19
and two copies in H20 was 1.2-fold higher than
expected under the null hypothesis (Figure 5, additional
file 2). Base frequency of allele cGAPDH-2 with presumably one genomic copy was slightly lower than expected,
but the difference was only marginally significant. Transcription level of allele cGAPDH-3 was significantly
higher than expected from genomic DNA. Transcription
of cGAPDH-4 sampled only in plant H20 could not be
analysed, because we detected no specific SNP in the
coding region suitable for pyrosequencing.
In nrITS we did not observe significant differences
between the frequency of allele-specific bases of cDNApools and genomic DNA in any of the alleles, so that
the null hypothesis of equal transcription was not
rejected (Figure 7, additional file 2).

Discussion
In this study we investigated by the analysis of two single
copy genes and one ribosomal DNA locus, whether
sequence divergence and transcription levels differ
between homeologous nuclear genes in pentaploid Rosa
canina. We were interested to determine whether the
fate of a homeolog depends on its copy number and thus
very likely on whether it is localized on bivalent forming
chromosomes undergoing recombination, or on univalent chromosomes, which are transmitted “apomictically”
(without recombination) to the offspring in dogroses.
Sequence divergence between alleles

We detected a maximum number of four different alleles in
the analysed genes in pentaploid Rosa canina (Figures 2, 4, 6)

suggesting that at least one allele has two or more identical copies, which is in accordance with previous
research [9,16-20]. These studies based on rDNA loci
and microsatellites from different linkage groups demonstrated that the alleles with identical copies were always
transmitted by pollen grains and egg cells and therefore
must be located on bivalent forming chromosomes,
whereas the remaining alleles are exclusively maternally
inherited via univalent chromosomes. It is assumed that
chromosome sets forming bivalents refer to a probably
extinct diploid Proto-Caninae progenitor characterized by
the Canina-ITS type (Figure 6) so far solely found in
polyploid dogroses (referred to as b clade in [9,19,20]).
However, this unique nrITS type might also have arisen
by mutation as shown for the hybrid-specific rDNA units
in Nicotiana allopolyploids [26]. The preservation of
homeologs in dogroses is not exceptional and has often
been used to track the hybridogenic origin of allopolyploids, e.g. [27-30]. However, loss of homeologs has been
observed in other very recently evolved hybridogenic species [31-35]. These cases of massive gene loss are mainly
documented in herbaceous plants, while dogroses are
woody and have much longer generation times. Our data
correspond with the situation found in allotetraploid cotton for which gene loss seems not to be a common phenomenon accompanying allopolyploidy [36].
The results found for the nrITS region are comparable
but more complicated than those of the single copy
genes LEAFY and cGAPDH, because nrITS is part of a
gene family, large tandem repeats of ribosomal DNA
loci, whose copies are normally homogenized by
mechanisms of concerted evolution [37]. However, in
dogroses homeologous rDNA clusters are also preserved, because sequences are mainly homogenized
within one locus but not between loci [22,23]. In contrast to this, some rDNA families were physically lost,
degenerated or were overwritten by more dominant
ones in other well studied allopolyploid systems [38-41].
During our analyses we found very few chimeric
sequences (< 5%) and all of them were unique, thus

these sequences originated most likely by stochastic PCR
recombination [42]. This apparent absence of recombinant alleles is concordant with the study of Khaitová
et al. (2010) [20] in dogroses and corresponds with
results from Nicotiana demonstrating that recombination
between nuclear glutamine synthetase sequences
occurred in diploid but not in allopolyploid Nicotiana
hybrids [30]. In contrast, recombinant alleles between

progenitor sequences were observed in allopolyploid
Gossypium [43] and Tragopogon [44].
In none of the investigated genes we observed signs of
loss of function for homeologs (e.g. premature stop
codons, deviating GC content; see also [9]). Moreover,
relative rate tests for LEAFY and cGAPDH did not
detect differential rates of sequence evolution between
alleles of one locus. Selection analyses revealed that all

the majority of homeologous genes in allopolyploid systems [5]. We found no evidence for complete epigenetic
silencing of a homeolog, which has been reported for
cGAPDH and ribosomal DNAs in allotetraploid

number (Figure 5). For nuclear ribosomal RNA we
detected no deviation from the expected transcription
level (Figure 7). These results demonstrate that transcription level is not directly related to copy number
of alleles. Analogous to results from microsatellites
and rDNA loci [9,16-20] we assume that alleles with
two copies are located on the bivalent forming chromosomes, even though alternative scenarios cannot be
completely ruled out at the moment. Following this
assumption our results suggest that there is no general
evolutionary fate for a homeolog located on a bivalentor univalent-forming chromosome. Comparable results
were obtained in case of the triploid hybrid fish Squalidus alburnoides for which silencing patterns for
dosage compensation were rather gene- than genomespecific [14]. According to the above cited studies we
presume that LEAFY homeologs with one copy are
located on the univalent chromosomes. The increased
transcription of these LEAFY alleles (Figure 3) provides
an example that genetic information from non-recombining genomes is functional and active. This contrasts
findings from Nicotiana allopolyploids for which an
inverse correlation between silencing and the intensity
of inter-genomic recombination has been proposed

[45]. It is a matter of speculation whether the pronounced transcription differences in LEAFY represents
an exception because LEAFY is an transcription factor
expressed in floral organs whereas the two other loci
cGAPDH and nrITS are expressed in every tissue, but
recent studies demonstrate that gene classification is
not a strong predictor for differential expression
patterns [46].
Contrary to our results Khaitová et al. (2010), who
investigated six different dogrose species based on
cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence (CAPS) analysis, concluded that nrITS-1 copies located on univalent
genomes are more frequently silenced than loci from
bivalent forming genomes [20]. Using the same marker
but pyrosequencing for transcription analysis we did not
find any differential transcription of rDNA loci in Rosa
canina. However, according to the results of Khaitová
et al. 2010, differences in transcription level of rDNA
alleles were less pronounced in R. canina compared to
other dogrose species, e.g. R. rubiginosa L. [20]. Differences between the two studies might be caused by the
origin of ribosomal RNA, which was extracted from
leaves by Khaitová et al. (2010) and from two different
stages of flower buds here [20]. Gene expression has
shown to be organ-specific [47,48] and varies strongly
between leaves and floral tissues in allopolyploids [49].
Moreover, rRNA genes which were silenced in leaves
were expressed in floral organs in Brassica [50]. We did

Figure 7 Allele-specific transcription of nrITS. Frequency of allele-specific bases for three SNPs in PCR products from genomic DNA and from
cDNA pools of small and large flower buds were obtained by pyrosequencing for the plants (H13, H19, H20) and are presented as boxplots
consisting of sample minimum, lower quartile, median, upper quartile and sample maximum. Black boxes refer to genomic DNA, white boxes to
cDNAs. Dotted lines represent the proposed frequency of an allele-specific base in genomic DNA and the null hypothesis of equal transcription
for all alleles referring to their copy number: Alleles with one copy have an expected frequency of 0.2; alleles with two copies have an expected
frequency of 0.4 and alleles with three copies have an expected frequency of 0.6 in pentaploids. SNP2 and SNP4 did not differentiate between
the Canina-1 and Canina-2 allele, thus boxplots of genomic DNA summarize the frequency of both alleles. Because allelic composition in the
genomic DNA varied between individuals H13, H20 and H19, results are presented separately. P-values of GLM statistics (additional file 2)

not find differences in expression patterns between very
young and elder flower buds, whereas such developmentally dependent expression patterns were shown in cotton
[51]. Our results might also be influenced by the method
of reverse transcription. We used oligo-dT primers,
which are suited for RNA polymerase II products with
polyadenylated 3’ ends but the poly(A) stretch is normally absent in functional rRNAs and present in intermediates of a RNA degradation pathway [52]. However,
we do not expect a strong impact of these rare degradation products on our results because conditions of
reverse transcription were not stringent and rRNAs were
highly overrepresented in RNA templates.

Conclusions
We analysed three marker genes to investigate homeologspecific transcription levels in pentaploid dogroses. Based
on previous research we assume that alleles located on
bivalent-forming (recombining) chromosomes have identical copies [16,17,19,20]. We could show that sequence
divergence and transcription intensity is not always
strongly correlated with the copy number of alleles. Thus
we found no evidence that genetic information on nonrecombining genomes is degraded or less functional than
genes from recombining chromosomes. The absence of
differential selection between dogrose genomes is surprising because it is assumed that sect. Caninae originated

during Miocene to Pliocene (approximately 6 Mya) [53]
and fossils of rose hips were found in deposits of the
Lower Oligocene (approximately 25 Mya) [54]). Contrary,
massive gene loss and heavily changed expression profiles
have been observed in other very young allopolyploids
even after a few generations [31-34]. Despite the preferential pairing of two homologous chromosome sets during
meiosis, dogroses are functional diploids in terms of chromosome pairing as suggested by Grant (1971) [8]; however, they are no functional diploids in terms of genome
activity, since they transcribe genes and thus use information from all involved genomes. This might be a selective
advantage because polyploid dogroses dominate Central
European rose populations and repel diploid wild roses
towards more or less isolated habitats [15]. Their success
could be caused by fixing heterozygosity on univalent genomes on one hand and escaping the evolutionary bottleneck of complete apomixis by maintaining recombination
between bivalents on the other hand. The heterogeneous
results from our analysis demand further research on the
transcriptome of dogroses which considers a broader sampling of species and genes and accounts also for possible
tissue-specific differences.

Methods
Plant Material

Five individuals of R. canina were sampled from a natural population “Himmelreich”, Jena, Germany (plants:
H13, H17, H19, H20, H21), and two individuals of
R. canina were taken from the dogrose collection at the
Botanical Garden Gießen, which were originally collected at the natural population “Einzelberg”, Groß
Schneen, Germany (plants 194, 378). Voucher specimens
have been deposited at the Herbarium Gießen (GIE).
Ploidy Determination

Flow-cytometry was conducted according to the method
described in [55] using a Cell Counter Analyzer CCA II
(Partec, Münster, Germany) and Rosa arvensis Huds. (2n =
2x = 14) as an internal diploid standard. A minimum of
10,000 nuclei giving peaks with a coefficient of variation of
approximately 10% were counted.
DNA and RNA Extraction

DNA was extracted from young leaf material according
to [56]. Total RNA was obtained from small and large
floral buds using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol
and its modifications described by [57]. First strand
cDNA was synthesized by RevertAid™ H Minus MMulLV Reverse Transcriptase (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot,
Germany) using an oligo-dT primer.

Sequence determination

Sequences of LEAFY, cGAPDH and nrITS-1 were
obtained from genomic DNA to identify polymorphisms
between alleles located on different chromosome sets.
Primers for the amplification of LEAFY were designed
from an alignment of cDNAs of LEAFY of different species of Rosaceae: LFYex1-fwd (5’-CAAGTGGGACCTACGAGGCATGG-3’) and LFYex3-rev (5’-TCGGCGT
GACAAAGCTGACGAAG-3’). Primers for the amplification of cGAPDH were designed from cDNAs of Rosa
chinensis Jacq. and Fragaria × ananassa (Weston)
Rozier taken from Genbank: GPDex2-fwd (5’-GCCAAGATCAAGATCGGAATCAACG-3’) and GPDex11-rev
(5’-CTCGTTCAATGCAATTCCAGCCTTG-3’). Primers
for amplification of nrITS were taken from [58]. PCR
was performed in 50 μl containing 2 μl of undiluted or
diluted genomic DNA, 2 units Taq-Polymerase (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany), 5.0 μl 10-fold polymerase buffer (Fermentas), 4.0 μl MgCl2 (25 mM), 2 μl of
each primer (10 μM), 5.0 μl dNTPs (2 mM). The following PCR protocol was performed: initial denaturation
cycle of 150 s at 94°C, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s
denaturation at 94°C, 60 s annealing [annealing temperature (T A ): T A = 58°C for LEAFY, T A = 51°C for
cGAPDH and TA = 48°C for nrITS-1], 180 s extension
at 72° C and a final extension for 10 min at 72°C. Purified PCR-products (Wizard SV Gel and PCR clean up
system, Promega, Mannheim, Germany) were cloned
into the vectors pGEMT (Promega) or pJET1 (Fermentas). Ligation products were electroporated into E. coli
JM109 or DH5a. Twenty positive clones of at least two
PCR products were sequenced in both directions using
the same primers as for amplification and additional
internal primers for LEAFY (LFYex2-fwd: 5’-CAAGAGAAGGAGATGGTTGGGAG-3’and LFYex2-rev: 5’GCTGCTTGGCAATGTTCTGGAC-3’) and cGAPDH
(GPDex6-fwd: 5’-GTCAATGAGCATGAATACAAGT
CC-3’ and GPDex6-rev: 5’-GACTTGTATTCATGCTCATTGAC-3’). Sequences of the alleles LEAFY-4,
cGAPDH-2 and cGAPDH-4 were only sampled in some
plants. To test for the presence of these alleles in the
remaining plants we performed allele-specific PCRs
according to the conditions described above using the
forward primers (LFYin1-al4-fwd: 5’-GGACATGTAAATAGGTCGAGAATATAT-3’, GPDin2-al2-fwd: 5’AGTTTTCGGATTTTGGTTTCGATC-3’ and GPDin3al4-fwd: 5’-ATCTTTGATGTTTTCGGAGTTATATG3’, respectively) spanning over allele-specific indels in
introns. Resulting sequences were assembled and aligned
using Bioedit [59]. New sequence information generated
within this study was deposited at the EMBL sequence
archive under accession IDs FR725963 - FR725973.

Southern Hybridizations

To estimate the copy numbers of LEAFY and cGAPDH
30 μg of genomic DNA of plant sample H20 was digested
with either EcoRI, HincII, HindIII, KpnI, PstI or XbaI,
separated on 1% agarose gels and blotted onto positively
charged nylon membranes (VWR, Darmstadt, Germany).
Membranes were hybridized with 32P-adATP-labelled
LEAFY or cGAPDH fragments according to NEBlot Kit
(NEB, Frankfurt, Germany). Hybridization probes were
prepared from pJET1 plasmids by PCR using the primers
LFYex2-fwd, LFYex3-rev and GPDx7F [27], GPDex11rev, respectively, under same conditions as above. Gene
fragments of LEAFY produced under these conditions
have an expected length of 1200 bp and those of
cGAPDH a length of 850 bp.
Phylogenetic analyses

The best fitting model according to the corrected
Akaike Information Criterion for each alignment was
estimated for exon and intron sequences separately with
MrModeltest v. 2.3 [60]. The parameters of the best
model for each partition were employed to reconstruct
phylogenies of LEAFY and cGAPDH with MrBayes
v.3.1.2 [61], additional file 5). We ran the analyses over
10,000,000 generations, sampling every 100th generation
and discarding the 100,000 trees as burn-in resulting in
a 50% majority rule consensus tree showing all compatible partitions supported by posterior probabilities (PP)
for each node. The phylogeny of LEAFY was rooted
with cDNA sequences of Fragaria vesca L. and other
species of Rosaceae, phylogeny of cGAPDH with a
cDNA sequence of Fragaria × ananassa and Arabidopsis thaliana L. (Heynh.). Alignments and phylogenies
were deposited in Treebase [http://www.treebase.org
(study accession: TB2:S11025)].
A phylogenetic network was calculated with TCS v.
1.2.1 [62] for the nrITS-1 sequence data including also
consensus sequences of different Rosa nrITS alleles
detected in a former study [9] under 95% connection
limit and gaps treated as missing data.
Selection analyses

Previous studies on microsatellite alleles demonstrated
that alleles with two or more copies are involved in
bivalent formation [16,17] and thus undergo recombination during meiosis. Therefore, we wanted to investigate
whether alleles of LEAFY and cGAPDH with two or
more copies evolve differentially from alleles with one
copy. We conducted Maximum Likelihood pairwise
Relative Rate Tests (RRT) implemented in the program
HyPhy [63] using the Muse-Gaut model (MG94W9 in
HyPhy [64] of codon substitution to estimate the relative rates of substitutions between different alleles of
LEAFY and cGAPDH, respectively, and out-group

sequences from Fragaria. The resulting parameter estimates were compared by a series of Likelihood Ratio
Tests (LRT). To control for the False Discovery Rate we
corrected original P-values with the BenjaminiHochberg [65] formula as recommended by the HyPhy
online discussion forum.
To test whether coding regions of LEAFY and
cGAPDH alleles with two or more genomic copies are
under other selective regimes than alleles with one copy
we estimated the ratio (ω) of the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions at non-synonymous sites (dN)
to synonymous substitutions at synonymous sites (dS).
The estimates of ω indicate whether an allele is under
purifying selection (ω < 1), positive selection (ω > 1) or
evolves neutrally (ω = 1). We conducted the analyses
based on an alignment of consensus sequences of the
coding region of LEAFY and cGAPDH alleles and an
unrooted topology of them using the program codeml
from the PAML package [66,67]. LRT was employed to
test, whether the model assuming different ω’s for the
allele with two or more copies than alleles with one
copy (alternative hypothesis) fits better to the data than
the model assuming the same ω for all sequences (null
hypothesis).
Allele-specific transcription

Allele-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
in the coding region were used to estimate the frequency of the different alleles in cDNA pools by pyrosequencing as a measure for their specific transcription.
Suitable pyrosequencing templates containing allelespecific SNPs were deduced from alignments of LEAFY,
cGAPDH and nrITS-1, respectively. We analysed the
same SNPs in genomic DNA to control for the copy
number of alleles in the plants. The expected frequency
in genomic DNA of an allele-specific base at a SNP is
0.2 for an allele with one copy, 0.4 for an allele with two
copies and 0.6 for an allele with three copies in pentaploid individuals. These expected frequencies represent
the null hypothesis of equal transcription of all alleles
referring to their copy number. Three PCR products
from cDNA pools of small and large flower buds of the
individuals H13, H19 and H20 were amplified with primers presented in additional file 6 according to the
cycling programs mentioned above. To control for contamination of RNA extracts with genomic DNA we performed PCR reactions using RNA extracts directly.
Additionally, two PCR products from genomic DNA of
the same plants were generated.
Template generation was done as described previously
[68]. Briefly, purified PCR products were ligated into the
vector pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany).
The recombinant DNA was used as template in a second
PCR using universal biotin-labelled primers bt-f or bt-r

Ritz et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:37
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/37

and sequence specific pyrosequencing primers (additional
file 7). Purification of biotin-labelled ssDNA was done
using streptavidin Sepharose (Biotage, Uppsala, Sweden).
Sequencing reaction and allele frequency determination
was carried out on a PSQ96 MA machine (Biotage)
following the manufacturer’s instruction.
Statistics

Statistical tests were performed with SPSS v. 17.0. To
test the influence of bud age and the investigated individual on transcription levels of alleles we performed Univariate ANOVA for each SNP in each locus. We
detected a significant impact of the individuals but no
significant impact of bud age on transcription level (data
not shown). Thus we performed General Linear Model
(GLM) analysis with “individual” as random factor to
test whether allele frequency measured in genomic
DNA differs significantly from allele frequency measured
in cDNAs for each SNP in each locus. In cases where
genomic allele composition differed between individuals
we performed the tests separately.
