Abstract
Background: Arenaviruses are a family of rodent-borne viruses that cause several hemorrhagic
fevers. These diseases can be devastating and are often lethal. Herein, to aid in the design and
development of diagnostics, treatments and vaccines for arenavirus infections, we have developed
a database containing protein sequences from the seven pathogenic arenaviruses (Junin, Guanarito,
Sabia, Machupo, Whitewater Arroyo, Lassa and LCMV).
Results: The database currently contains a non-redundant set of 333 protein sequences which
were manually annotated. All entries were linked to NCBI and cited PubMed references. The
database has a convenient query interface including BLAST search. Sequence variability analyses
were also performed and the results are hosted in the database.
Conclusion: The database is available at http://epitope.liai.org:8080/projects/arena and can be
used to aid in studies that require proteomic information from pathogenic arenaviruses.

Background
Arenaviridae are a family of viruses whose members are
associated with rodent-transmitted disease in humans.
Each virus usually is associated with a particular rodent
host species in which it is maintained. Arenavirus infections, occur when an individual comes into contact with
the excretions of an infected rodent, are relatively common in humans in some area of the world and primarily
cause hemorrhagic fevers, including Lassa fever (LF; Lassa
virus), Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF; Junin virus),
Bolivian hemorrhagic fever (BHF; Machupo virus), Venezuelan hemorrhagic fever (VHF; Guanarito virus) and Brazillian hemorrhagic fever (BrHF; Sabia virus) [1-6]. These

diseases can be devastating and often lethal. Lymphocytic
choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), a known human teratogen, can cause aseptic meningitis [7-9], and Whitewater
Arroyo Virus (WWA) was recently attributed to two deaths
in California [10,11].
The arenaviruses can be classified phylogenetically into
Old World (which includes LCMV and Lassa virus) and
New World; this latter group has been further divided into
three lineages, A-C [12,13]. Except for WWA virus which
belongs to lineage A, the four most pathogenic New
World agents (Junin, Machupo, Guanarito and Sabia
viruses) all belong to lineage B, suggesting that the highly

pathogenic phenotype may derive from a common ancestral virus [12,14]. All of these viruses cause significant
morbidity and mortality. Lassa virus and other hemorrhagic fever arenaviruses (Junin, Machupo, Guanarito and
Sabia) are included in category A of potential bioterrorism
microbial weapons [15].
Currently, there are no virus-specific treatments approved
for use against arenavirus hemorrhagic fevers. Ribavirin is
the only compound that has shown partial efficacy against
some arenavirus infections [16] (successful against
human Lassa infections only if given within the first week
following disease onset [17]), and to date only one vaccine (against AHF) has been evaluated in humans [2].
Because of its severe morbidity and high mortality
together with lack of immunization or effective treatment,
scientists and researchers are challenged with developing
containment, treatment, and vaccine strategies for arenavirus infection. For the purpose of developing diagnostic
reagents and designing novel vaccine constructs, our
group has been conducting active studies in identifying
MHC class I and II restricted T cell epitopes from patho-

genic arenaviruses. As a component of the studies, we
have compiled and developed a database of protein
sequences for the seven arenaviruses (Lassa, LCMV, Junin,
Guanarito, Sabia, Machupo and WWA) known to cause
disease in humans. Herein, we make this database available as a public resource to aid in studies that require proteomic information from pathogenic arenaviruses.

Construction and content
Arenaviridae are enveloped viruses with a genome consisting of two single-stranded RNA, the small (S) and the
large (L), segments. Each segment encodes two different
proteins. The S RNA encodes the nucleocapsid protein
(NP) and the glycoprotein precursor (GPC) which undergoes post-translational processing to yield two mature
proteins (GP1 and GP2) [18]. The L RNA encodes the viral
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and a zinc-binding
matrix protein (Z) [19,20]. These four proteins (GPC, L,
NP and Z) are the collection targets of our database.
The process of compiling arenaviral protein sequences for
the database includes 1) retrieving published sequences
from NCBI, 2) parsing for sequence information, 3) manually verifying the information and performing additional
annotations, and 4) removing duplicated entries. A schematic flow chart of this process is shown in Figure 1.
MySQL was used as the storage database engine, Tomcat
as the webserver, and Java servlets were used to develop
the web interface.
To obtain protein sequences encoded by the seven pathogenic arenaviruses, we first searched the NCBI database
through the use of an automated computer program
developed in our laboratory. This program was written to:
(1) search for protein sequence IDs, (2) retrieve protein
sequence records and (3) parse the records into annotated
fields. First, protein sequence IDs (GI numbers) were
retrieved via an NCBI Esearch programming utility using
NCBI taxonomy IDs as search parameters. Next, GI numbers were used to retrieve protein sequence records in the
GenPept format. "NCBISequenceDB" java class from biojava 1.4 package was used to programmatically retrieve
the GenPept sequence records. Finally, a customized java
class was written to parse each record into annotated
fields which include protein sequence data, source references, virus, strain and gene name.
Using the automated program, 525 protein sequences
were retrieved from NCBI. Next, verification of sequence
authenticity was performed via supporting publications
and/or written summaries. Finally, we conducted manual
protein sequence alignments to identify and remove
duplications. Of the 525 protein sequences from the initial cohort, a total of 333 unique protein sequences from
one or more strains of the seven pathogenic arenavirus

viruses were obtained (Table 1). At present, the Z protein
sequence has not been published for WWA virus. As a
result of renewed interests in arenaviruses, we anticipate
that more protein sequences will become available in the
near future. We plan to periodically monitor the scientific
literature and the NCBI database for new sequence depositions, and update our database accordingly.

Utility and discussion
Arenavirus protein sequence annotation
To maximize the usefulness of the arenavirus protein
sequence database to the scientific community, each
record was annotated with specific information, including
the host and geographical region from which each protein
sequence was isolated and the passage history of each viral
strains between its original isolation from its natural host
and the time it was sequenced. Inclusion of the host that

each protein sequence was isolated from is of potential
relevance in studies examining specific host-derived
immune pressure or host-specific viral adaptations. The
inclusion, if available, of the geographical region is relevant in determining whether the available viral strains are
represented in endemic locations. Finally, the passage history of each strain is relevant in the context of the high
mutation rates associated with these RNA viruses and the
potential for genetic changes to accumulate as a result of
in vitro passage. Mutations generated as a result of viral
passage in non-reservoir animals or cell lines would not
be representative of the natural variation present in field
or clinical strains. All annotated information was
obtained via collected publications and/or via direct correspondence with the authors of a given protein sequence.
Most protein sequences were derived from human infections, while the remaining samples came from naturally

diagnostics and/or vaccine constructs. A BLAST search was
also implemented allowing users to search for similar
sequences contained within the database (Figure 4).

Search Interface
The arenavirus protein sequence database has a convenient search interface allowing querying by virus, strain and
protein names (Figure 2). All entries in the database are
linked to the original NCBI records and cited PubMed references (if available). In addition, a tool utility is also provided that allows searching for arenavirus sequences
containing specific peptides or epitope sequences (Figure
3). For example, this would allow researchers to quickly
determine whether known epitopes are expressed by various arenavirus strains and species. This information could
therefore be used to develop arenaviral epitope-based

Arenavirus protein sequence variability analysis
Using the sequences in this database, we further investigated the arenaviral protein sequence conservancy/variability. Our goal was to identify conserved or variable
regions that could be targeted for development of a universal arenaviral vaccine or diagnostics, respectively. To
do this, we performed multiple sequence alignments and
entropy analyses between different strains of a virus and
between different viruses.

Multiple sequence alignments were performed using
CLUSTAL W program [21] using default parameters. To

estimate the diversity a multiple protein sequence alignment, Shannon entropy (H) was calculated using equation 1 [22]:
M

H = ââ Pi log 2 Pi
i =1

(1)

where Pi is the fraction of residues of amino acid type i,
and M is the number of amino acid types (20). H ranges
from 0 (only one residue in present at that position) to
4.322 (all 20 residues are equally represented in that position). Typically, positions with H â¥ 2.0 are considered variable, whereas those with H â¤ 2 are consider conserved.
Highly conserved positions are those with H â¤ 1.0 [23].
Shannon entropy analyses of protein sequences contained
in our database indicated that arenavirus protein
sequences are fairly conserved between different strains of

the same virus, but less so between different viruses. This
is consistent with the view that arenaviruses are relatively
stable genetically with amino acid sequence homologies
of 90â95% among different strains of the same virus species and of 44â63% for homologous proteins of different
arenavirus species [24]. As a result, to develop a universal
vaccine against different arenaviruses, a construct that
contains epitopes conserved within each virus should be
used. For the purpose of developing diagnostics, however,
epitopes derived from non-conserved regions would be
excellent candidates.
The most important arenaviral proteins are NP and GPC,
and the NP proteins have been known as being the most
conserved among arenaviruses. Our entropy analysis also
revealed that the NP protein has a highly distinct intervirus conserved region between residues 1â310 with average H â 0.5 (Figure 5). Another distinct conserved region

is in the GPC protein between residues 290â500 (Figure
6). As a result, epitopes derived from these regions have
high probabilities to be cross-reactive between different
arenaviruses. In contrast to long conserved regions
observed in the NP and GPC proteins, the L and Z proteins have much shorter inter-virus conserved regions
which could be related to the proteins' shared functional
homology.
As curated in the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB)
[25,26] and at the time of this analysis, epitopes derived
from arenaviruses (mainly Lassa and LCMV), were exclusively from NP and GPC proteins. The majority of these
epitopes were mouse MHC class I restricted and located in
the conserved regions of NP and GPC proteins (data not
shown). This indicates the identified T cell epitopes from
NP and GPC proteins may cross-react among different
arenavirus species. Nevertheless, whether these mouse
MHC restricted epitopes would also be reactive in humans

remains to be experimentally validated. It should be
noted here that the lack of L and Z derived epitopes, as
reported in IEDB, may imply that the curation is incomplete or more likely that no studies have yet been done to
look for epitopes in these proteins.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the database developed here, to our knowledge, is the only public resource that provides a nonredundant complete set of viral protein sequences for the
seven highly pathogenic arenaviruses. These protein
sequences can be used for epitope discovery studies, and
their specific annotations are highly relevant for consideration in the complex task of developing diagnostics and/
or vaccines. In another aspect, this database would also be
a useful resource for scientists to investigate functionsequence conservation relationships among the arenaviruses.
