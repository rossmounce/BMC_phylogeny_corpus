Abstract
Background: We advocate unifying classical and genomic classification of bacteriophages by
integration of proteomic data and physicochemical parameters. Our previous application of this
approach to the entirely sequenced members of the Podoviridae fully supported the current phage
classification of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). It appears that
horizontal gene transfer generally does not totally obliterate evolutionary relationships between
phages.
Results: CoreGenes/CoreExtractor proteome comparison techniques applied to 102 Myoviridae
suggest the establishment of three subfamilies (Peduovirinae, Teequatrovirinae, the Spounavirinae) and
eight new independent genera (Bcep781, BcepMu, FelixO1, HAP1, Bzx1, PB1, phiCD119, and
phiKZ-like viruses). The Peduovirinae subfamily, derived from the P2-related phages, is composed
of two distinct genera: the "P2-like viruses", and the "HP1-like viruses". At present, the more
complex Teequatrovirinae subfamily has two genera, the "T4-like" and "KVP40-like viruses". In the
genus "T4-like viruses" proper, four groups sharing >70% proteins are distinguished: T4-type,
44RR-type, RB43-type, and RB49-type viruses. The Spounavirinae contain the "SPO1-"and "Twortlike viruses."
Conclusion: The hierarchical clustering of these groupings provide biologically significant
subdivisions, which are consistent with our previous analysis of the Podoviridae.

Background
We recently described methods aimed at unifying classical
and genomic classification of bacteriophages by integration of protein sequence data and physicochemical
parameters. We developed two protein sequence similarity-based tools, CoreExtractor and CoreGenes [1], to
parse-out and quantify relationships between pairs of
phages resulting in a single correlation score [2]. This
analysis is followed by a deconstruction and literature
analysis of the known morphological and physicochemical characteristics of these phages. The biological interpretation of molecular correlations between 55 fully
sequenced Podoviridae show that this approach agrees
with the current phage classification of the International
Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and suggests
that, generally, horizontal gene transfer only partially
masks evolutionary relationships between phages. Using
a cut-off value of 40% homologous proteins, we verified
relationships between phages known to be similar and
identified several new bacteriophage genera. At the 2030% homology level, we identified relationships of a
higher order justifying the introduction of the subfamily
taxonomical category.
The Myoviridae in the VIIIth ICTV Report comprise five
genera of bacteriophages (Mu, P1, P2, SPO1, and T4-like
viruses) and one genus of archeal viruses, phiH. I3 and
phiKZ-like phages have been recently proposed as additional genera http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ICTVdb/Ictv/
fs_myovi.htm. These genera include only a small fraction
of presently known myoviruses with fully sequenced
genomes [3]. We analyze and interpret here the correlations between 102 Myoviridae genomes found in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
and the Tulane University T4 Genome databases.

Results and discussion
Figure 1 shows the correlation, based on the CoreExtractor
distance measure, among all available Myoviridae
genomes in the NCBI databases. To verify and more subtly
compare individual correlations, the CoreGenes approach
was applied to subsets of related phages, including several
genomes not currently available in public databases
(Table 1). As in previous analyses of the Podoviridae [2],
threshold values of 40% and 20% (and 0.6 and 0.8 relative dissimilarity, respectively) of homologous proteins
strongly suggest genus and subfamily boundaries, respectively (Additional file 1). They are corroborated by morphological, molecular or physiological data and discussed
in the paragraphs below.

A. Myoviridae Subfamilies
I. Teequatrovirinae
1. T4-like viruses nova comb
The ICTV currently lists only six sequenced viruses as
members of the T4 phage genus, namely enterobacterial
phage T4, Acinetobacter phage 133, Aeromonas phages
Aeh1, 65 and 44RR2.8t, and Vibrio phage nt-1. However,
the scientific literature and public databases abound with
descriptions of "T4-like" phages and the analysis of complete genome sequences indicates that the T4-related
phages constitute one of the largest groups of bacterial
viruses. This corroborates ecogenomic studies on the
diversity of these viruses as apparent in the heterogeneity
of capsid (gp23) genes in isolates from Japanese rice fields
[4], marine systems [5,6], and from Lithuania [7], Bangladesh and Switzerland [8]. These studies suggest that the
fully sequenced T4 phages are but a small fraction of the
T4-related genomes in nature. Nevertheless, there are clear
commonalities among all sequenced "T4-like" genomes
from different host groups, including the cyanophages,
namely a set of 33-35 genes that have persisted during the
evolution of genomes with sizes from 160 to 250 kb [9].
This core of genes seems to have resisted divergence
throughout evolution. Nevertheless, these horizontal substitutions do not erase the evidence of the global relationship between phages and clear hybrid phages within this
group have not been identified to date [10,11]. Work
done at Tulane University [10,11], led to the tentative
conclusion that it takes about 33 T4 genes to determine a
genetic program that controls lytic phage development in
the host cell.

Based on the Myoviridae cluster dendrogram (Figure 1),
the current ICTV genus "T4-like viruses" can be subdivided into two genera and several subgroups. By analogy
to the T7-related podoviruses, now named the Autographivirinae, the former ICTV genus was raised to the rank of a
subfamily, the Teequatrovirinae, named after the best-studied of these phages, coliphage T4. The first genus, the "T4like viruses", includes what were previously termed the Teven and "pseudo-T-even" phages [12,13]. Our name perpetuates the old ICTV nomenclature, but is now limited to
enterobacterial and Aeromonas phages. The KVP40 phages,
consisting of two former members of the "schizo-T-evens"
[14] form the other genus.
The "T4-like viruses" are morphologically indistinguishable and have moderately elongated heads of about 110
nm in length, 114 nm long tails with a collar, base plates
with short spikes, and six long kinked tail fibers. Within
this assemblage, we identified four distinct subtypes with
>70% protein similarity. These are the T4-type phages
(phages T4, JS10, JS98, RB14, RB32, RB51, RB69), 44RRtype (phages 44RR2.8t, 31, 25), RB43-type (RB43, RB16),
and the RB49-type viruses (RB49, JSE, 1). They can be

subdivided by the presence of specific encoded proteins as
outlined in Table 2. In the subtype T4 phages, three specific proteins with defined functions (Pin, MotB, ModA)
were found. Pin is an inhibitor of the host's Lon protease
[15,16], while the other two proteins function to modulate transcription [17,18].
Heteroduplex analyses indicate that coliphages T2, T4 and
T6 share >85% sequence similarity [19], warranting their
inclusion, in spite of lack of detailed sequence data for T2
and T6, into the T4-type subgroup. The DNA of the T-even
phages contains 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-HMC).
While this modified nucleotide is common in T4-related
phages [20], its presence has not been ascertained biochemically in the other phages (JS98, RB14, RB32, RB69)
included in this subgroup. T4 gp42 dCMP hydroxymethylase and Alc that blocks transcription from cytosine containing DNA are required for the incorporation of 5-HMC
rather than cytosine into T-even DNA. Genes specifying
homologs of the T4 gp42 and Alc proteins are also present
in the 44RR2.8t-type phages.
2. KVP40-like viruses
The KVP40 viruses comprise two marine vibriophages,
KVP40 and nt-1, with genomes of approximately 246 kb.
KVP40 infects Vibrio parahaemolytius and was isolated
from seawater. Phage nt-1 infects Vibrio natriegens and
originates from a coastal marsh. The phages differ from T4
in head length (137 nm vs. 111 nm), but are identical to
phage T4 in tail morphology. KVP40 has a feather of decoration proteins on its head [21,22].

Three other T4 phages do not fit into these groups: Acinetobacter phage 133, Aeromonas hydrophila phage Aeh1
and Aeromonas salmonicida phage 65. Morphologically,
phage 133 is identical to T4, whereas Aeh1 and 65 have

the same heads of 133 nm in length as Vibrio phages
KVP40 and nt-1. They were considered to be part of the
"schizo-T-even" group [23] and have a T4-type tail structure [20]. CoreGenes and our supplementary phylogenetical analyses indicate that these phages are too dissimilar,
by our criteria, to be included into one of the genera listed
above.
The four marine cyanophages (P-SSM2, P-SSM4, S-PM2
and Syn9) infect Synechococcus or Prochlorococcus strains
and harbor T4 genes causing this group to be named the
"exo-T-evens" [24,25]. These phages have isometric heads
and much longer tails than T4. CoreGenes analysis indicates that they form a group sharing >40% proteins in
common. While P-SSM2, P-SSM4 and Syn9 share 93 proteins, they show considerable dissimilarity in appearance,
size, and DNA content (Table 3). Phylogenetic analysis
based upon sequence alignments of gp20 (portal vertex
protein [26]) and photosystem II protein D1 [27,28] indicate considerable diversity exist among cultured and environmental cyanophages. This is also confirmed by an
analysis of data from the marine virome from the Sorcerer
II Global Ocean Sampling expedition [29]. Based upon
these observations, we feel that the creation of genera
within cyanophage myoviruses is premature at the present
time.
Rhodothermus marinus phage RM378 (NC_004735) is a
virus said to have a head of 95 × 85 nm and a tail of 150
nm in length [30]. It was called a "ThermoT-even phage"
by Filée et al. [6], but our CoreGenes analysis reveals that
its proteins shows minimal sequence similarity to any T4related virus.

II. Peduovirinae
This subfamily is a large phage group derived from the
ICTV genus "P2-like phages" and is named the Peduovirinae. Virions have heads of 60 nm in diameter and tails of
135 × 18 nm. Phages are easily identified because contracted sheaths tend to slide off the tail core. The subfamily falls into three different groups. As shown by
CoreExtractor and CoreGenes analyses, and using the
40% similarity criterion for inclusion into the same genus,
phage HP1 has only 9 genes in common P2. Even if other
P2 phages are considered, HP1 shares only 17 genes with
any phage of the "P2-like" genus. Using the 40% similarity criterion for inclusion into the same genus, it is therefore justified to consider P2 and HP1 as members of
different genera and to upgrade the present genus "P2
phages" to a subfamily.
1. P2-like viruses nova comb
This genus includes P2 itself and its extensively studied
relative, coliphage 186. Both originate from the Pasteur
Institute in Paris, France. Phage P2 is one of three phages
(P1, P2, P3) isolated by G. Bertani in the beginning of the
1950's from the "Li" (Lisbonne and Carrère) strain of E.
coli [31]. Later on, F. Jacob and E. Wollman isolated phage
186 and many other viruses from enterobacteria collected
by L. Le Minor [32]. The reason for the early interest in
these phages was that P2 and 186 are temperate. The analysis of the genetic control of these two modes was the
starting point for ongoing fertile research on phage biology and molecular biology in general.

The genomes of phage P2 and 186 were the first P2
genomes to be fully sequenced and analyzed. Almost all
P2 and 186 genes have been assigned a function [33-35].
Coliphages W and L-413C are very similar to P2 in both
gene content and gene order. They are closely related to

each other, sharing all but one protein. The only genes of
these phages that differ from P2 are the lysogeny-related
genes, which may have been horizontally acquired and
are totally different, but have been inserted at the same
locations into all genomes. The only exception to this is
that phage P2 has a 786 bp ORF (orf30) with unknown
function inserted between the S and V genes. There is no
such insertion in W and L-413C, but Pseudomonas phage
CTX (see below) has another uncharacterized ORF
located at this position. Enterobacterial phages 186, PSP3,
Fels-2, and SopE also share their overall gene order and
many genes with P2, but the genes are more diverged.
Unlike P2, these phages are UV-inducible due to the presence of the tum gene. In addition, they have a different
lysis-lysogeny switch region. P2 phages seem to have
either of two different proteins for repression of the lytic
cycle. P2, W and L-413C have the repressor gene C
whereas 186, PSP3, Fels-2, SopE, HP1, HP2, and K139
(below) instead have the sequence-unrelated genes CI and
CII, both of which are equally needed for establishing lysogeny.
Mannheimia phage -MhaA1-PHL101, Pseudomonas
phageCTX, and Ralstonia phage RSA1 have many P2
genes and an overall order of structural genes that is P2like, although interspersed with some uncharacterized
genes. Their presumed regulatory gene regions include
additional putative and uncharacterized ORFs. Phage
CTX has only the P2 regulatory gene ogr (transcriptional
activator of the late genes) and the recombination enzyme
int (integrase), -MhaA1-PHL101 has repressor (CI) and
antirepressor (Cro) equivalents which are most closely
related to the regulatory proteins of the P22-like enterobacteria phage ST104 than to P2.

Phage RSA1 seems to have only one P2-related regulatory
gene, the ogr gene, although it is more related to the Ogr/
Delta-like gene in CTX. The RSA1 integrase is more similar to the integrases of the P2-like Burkholderia phages
(E202, 52237, and E12-2 and P22-like viruses.
2. HP1-like viruses
The genome architecture of HP1 [36] and its close relative,
HP2, resembles that of P2 although their cos sites, as with
Pseudomonas CTX [37], are located next to attP rather
than downstream of the portal protein-encoding gene as
it is in P2. The P2 gene order is also conserved in Vibrio
phages K139 [38] and  and the Pasteurella phage F108
[39]. As in P2, the genomes can be divided into blocks of
structural and regulatory genes. The structural genes are
more similar in HP1 and HP2 than the regulatory genes.
The six genes coding for capsid proteins are arranged in
the same order in HP1 phages and many P2 phages. The
other structural genes, coding mainly for tail components,
show generally no similarity to those of P2 phages. Only
some of the regulatory genes are similar in both HP1 and
P2 phages, e.g., int, CI, and repA. Regulatory genes in general are more conserved within the HP1 group.

Aeromonas phage O18P [40] is included into the HP1
phages. It contains slightly more genes related to HP1
than to P2, although, when looking at individual proteins, it sometimes appears to have an intermediate position. Its Rep protein is very similar to the DNA replication
protein of Salmonella phage PSP3 and the A protein of
phages K139, F108, W, and P2 homologs. The O18P
major capsid protein is similar to the capsid proteins of
phages K139, CTX, 186, and the Burkholderia phages.

150 nm) [3,48], and, the DNA contains 5-hydroxymethyluracil (HMU) rather than thymine. The outliers of this
group comprise phages LP65 [41] and EF24C [42,43]. At
193 nm, the tail of phage LP65 is similar in length to that
of other members of this group, but its genome is not terminally redundant [41]. Lastly, the genome size (142 kb),
proteome and morphology of Enterococcus phage EF24C
is clearly consistent with membership in this group (head
diameter 93 nm; tail length 204 nm), but its genome is
circularly permuted. Their close relationship was discussed in a recent paper [44].
Using a BLASTP raw threshold score of 100 and CoreGenes 3.0 http://binf.gmu.edu:8080/CoreGenes3.0/ to
compare the proteomes of Twort, A511, LP65, and
EF24C against SPO1, we identified two clusters of genes
which are conserved. These corresponded to packaging
and morphogenesis genes (SPO1 gp2.11 to gp16.2); and
the cluster of replication genes, including helicase, exonuclease, primase, and resolvase (SPO1 gp19.5 - gp24.1).
The DNA polymerases (SPO1 gp31 and homologs) of
these phages are related more closely to bacterial-type I
DNA polymerases than other phage deoxynucleotide
polymerizing enzymes. The presence of host-related proteins in viruses has been observed by Dinsdale et al. [49]
and elegantly explained by Serwer [50]. Metagenomic
studies by the former group indicate the presence of
numerous host-related proteins, including those related
to motility and chemotaxis, in the virome fractions. While
the functional significance of photosynthetic protein psbA
in cyanophage genomes has been conclusively shown
[51,52], the presence of host-related sequences should
still be considered with healthy skepticism if the only data
is the presence of homologs.

III. The Spounavirinae
This proposed subfamily contains the ICTV-recognized
genus "SPO1-like viruses" and, on the basis of our results,
a proposed new genus (the "Twort-like viruses") and two
peripherally related viruses, Lactobacillus plantarum phage
LP65 [41] and Enterococcus faecalis phage EF24C [42,43].
All of these are virulent, broad-host range phages which
infect members of the Firmicutes. They possess isometric
heads of 87-94 nm in diameter and conspicuous capsomers, striated 140-219 nm long tails, a double base plate,
and globular structures at the tail tip. The latter have been
resolved as base plate spikes and short kinked tail fibers
with six-fold symmetry [44]. Members of this group usually possess large (127-142 kb) nonpermuted genomes
with 3.1-20 kb terminal redundancies [45,46]. The proposed name for this subfamily is derived from SPO plus
una (latin for "one").

1. SPO1-like viruses
The current ICTV genus "SPO1 viruses" comprises some
10 Bacillus phages and Lactobacillus phage 222a; only the
genome of SPO1 has been sequenced [53]. All SPO1-like
Bacillus phage genomes that have been studied contain 5hydroxymethyluracil (HMU) instead of thymine and
encode dUMP hydroxymethylase activity (SPO1 gp29).
This phage also contains the unique 171-amino acid head
decoration protein gp29.2. Whether this is unique to
members of this genus will require the sequencing of
additional genomes. Using cryo-electron microscopy,
Duda and coworkers [54] confirmed the earlier observation [47] that the icosahedral head of SPO1 head has the
triangulation number T = 16 rather than the more common T = 25. This feature is also shared with eukaryotic
herpesviruses.

While the head diameter of Bacillus phage SPO1, of 87 nm
[47], is consistent with membership in the group, its tail
is significantly shorter than that of most members (140-

2. Twort-like viruses
The phages form a fairly homogeneous group of virulent
phages infecting staphylococci (Twort, G1, K) [55] and

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:224

Listeria (A511, P100) [56]. The group is named after phage
"Twort," which may be a descendant of the original bacteriophage described by F.W. Twort in 1915 [57]. Apparently, this phage was deposited at the Pasteur Institute of
Paris in 1947 when Twort was invited there to retell the
story of his discovery (personal communication to H.W.A. by J.-F. Vieu, curator of the phage collection of the
Pasteur Institute; 1983).
B. Additional ICTV-recognized genera
1. Mu-like viruses
Phage Mu is morphologically almost identical to phage
P2. Although phage Mu shares features (e.g. replicative
transposition) with BcepMu [58] and two siphoviruses,
Pseudomonas phages B3 and D3112 [59,60], this phage
holds a unique position within the Myoviridae, since its
proteome displays only limited homology to any other
completely sequenced phage genome.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/224

group produce three types of head-size variants (small,
normal, intermediate).
C. Additional genera within the Myoviridae
1. Bcep781-like viruses
"Bcep" stands for Burkholderia cepacia, and phages with
this designation infect bacteria belonging to the B. cepacia
genomic complex. The Bcep781 phages form a group of
virulent myophages of which the genome sequence of five
members, Bcep781, Bcep1, Bcep43, BcepNY3 and Xanthomonas phage OP2, is known [68,69]. The Bcep781
phages are small viruses with distinctly shorter tails than
P2, Mu, and BcepMu [68].

Only coliphage D108, as shown by heteroduplex analysis,
shows significant similarity to Mu to warrant inclusion in
the Mu genus [61]. Unfortunately, only portions of the
genome of D108 have been sequenced. Putative Mu proviruses have been reported in a wide range of bacteria [6264]. CoreGenes analysis revealed that only some of them
can be reasonably described as Mu proviruses, namely,
Escherichia blattae prophage MuEb [65], Haemophilus influenzae Rd prophage Hin-Mu [66], and Shewanella oneidensis
prophage MuSo2 [NC_004347].

The genomes of these phages range from 46 to 49 kb in
size and encode 66 to 71 proteins. The four Bcep phages
encode a single tRNA each. They form a homogeneous
phage group not just in terms of sequence, but also by
their distinctive genome organization compared to other
groups. The genomes of the Bcep781 phages are divided
into four gene clusters encoded on alternate strands such
that, using Bcep781 as the example, genes 1 through 19
and 29 through 51 are present on the bottom strand while
genes 20 through 28 and 52 through 66 are present on the
top strand. Head genes are located in the first cluster and
tail genes are located in the third cluster. The virion major
capsid and decoration proteins, Bcep781 gp12 and gp13,
were identified by protein sequencing and show some
similarity to head proteins from the "PB1-like viruses"
group. Several tail morphogenesis proteins, corresponding to Bcep781 gp29 through gp52, can be linked to P2
tail genes by PSI-BLAST. In contrast to structural genes,
genes for DNA replication and lysis are scattered throughout the genome. The lysis genes of these phages are not
organized into a cassette but instead overlapping Rz and
Rz1 genes are separated from the endolysin and holin
genes [70]. A distinctive feature of these phages is the presence of highly, maybe completely, circularly permuted
genomes. The terminases of these phages are strongly
related to other pac-type phages that also have highly permuted genomes [71].

2. P1-like viruses
This small genus comprises coliphage P1, famous for its
cre recombinase and the large-insert cloning vectors engineered on the basis of the phage genome [67], P7
(AF503408) and its not yet sequenced putative relative
D7. Phage P1 stands out from any of the phages described
here by its morphology. Phage P1 differs from the phages
described here by size and morphology. It has a very large
head of approximately 85 nm in diameter and a very long
tail of 228 × 18 nm in the extended state. Tails have base
plates and 90 nm long, kinked fibers. The tails of related,
not yet sequenced phages of enterobacteria and Aeromonas
vary between 170 and 240 nm in length. All phages of this

2. BcepMu-like viruses
This group was named "BcepMu-like viruses" because,
like Mu and unlike most other phages, its members utilize
transposition for replication. The distinctive genomic feature implicating the use of replicative transposition is the
presence of random host DNA sequences at either end of
the packaged virion DNA [58]. These host sequences are
derived from excision of prophage DNA from random
sites scattered over the host genome. This requires fundamental differences in terminase function as compared to
more typical terminases that utilize concatemers of phage
genomic DNA as a substrate. This is reflected by the
homology between BcepMu TerL and Mu TerL. Another

Mu and P2 have only 4 proteins in common (overall 9.8%
similarity). P2 differs from Mu by genome size (33.6 kb
vs. 36.7 kp in Mu), the number of proteins (43 proteins
vs. 55 in Mu), gene order, and the presence of a single capsid protein and cohesive ends in its DNA. By contrast, Mu
has two capsid proteins and two sets of tail fiber genes and
replicates via transposition, which is a very rare mode of
replication. Mu shares this characteristic with BcepMu,
but BcepMu has no tail fiber inversion system and only a
limited proteomic correlation to Mu (9 gene homologs;
16.4% similarity).

Page 9 of 16

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:224

genome feature shared by BcepMu and Mu is the presence
of genomic terminal CA dinucleotide repeats, a feature
common in many transposons. Furthermore, BcepMu
and Mu seem to be morphologically identical.
Despite these similarities, BcepMu and its close relative
E255 have marked differences in genome organization
and minimal overall protein sequence similarity to Mu,
explaining why they have not been grouped together. The
putative BcepMu transposase is not related to the Mu
transposase, TnpA, but instead is a distant member of the
Tn552-IS1604 transposase family. The BcepMu genome is
organized into two clusters, with genes 1 through 13
encoded on the bottom strand and genes 17 through 52
on the top strand. The cluster of bottom strand genes
includes transcription regulators, the transposase, and a
number of small genes of unknown function. The lysogeny control region is likely to include genes 16 and 17,
located at the interface of the bottom strand/top strand
gene clusters. This is followed by a lysis cassette consisting
genes encoding a holin, endolysin, Rz and Rz1. Proteins
27 through 51 encompass the head and tail morphogenesis cassette. The BcepMu tail biosynthetic cassette proteins
are recognizably related both in sequence and in gene
order to those of coliphage P2.
BcepMu is present as a prophage in many B. cenocepacia
strains of the human pathogenic ET2 lineage [58,72].
Phage E255 is a phage of the soil saprophyte B. thailandensis [NC_009237]. BcepMu phages, however, are not
limited to Burkholderia hosts as related prophage elements
have been identified in the genomic sequence of many
other bacteria, for example Chromobacterium violaceum
[NP_901809].
3. Felix O1-like viruses
Salmonella phage Felix O1 has a relatively large head (70
nm in diameter) and a tail of 138 × 18 nm characterized
by subunits overlapping each other like roof tiles and
showing a criss-cross pattern like phages PB-1 and F8.
Notably, it exhibits small collars and eight straight tail fibers. Upon contraction, the base plate separates from the
sheath. The type virus Felix O1 is widely known as a diagnostic Salmonella-specific phage [21]. Until recently, the
genomic sequence (86.1 kb) of phage Felix O1 was
unique and was considered, as such, a "genomic orphan",
but two related genomes have been recently characterized,
though their sequences have yet to be deposited to the
public databases. They are coliphage wV8 and Erwinia
amylovora phage Ea21-4 (DNA sizes 88.5 and 84.6 kb,
respectively [73,74].
4. HAP1-like viruses
This genus contains two marine phages, Vibrio parahaemolyticus phage VP882 (NC_009016) and Halomonas aqua-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/224

marina phage HAP-1 [75]. Both are temperate viruses
possessing 38-43 kb genomes which lack integrase genes.
While our proteomic analysis and the literature suggests
that Vibrio harveyi phage VHML [76,77] should be
included in this genus, there is no evidence that this phage
can be propagated: it is only produced after induction,
does not plaque, and must be considered a defective
prophage. The data presented by Mobberley et al. [78]
show that HAP-1 exists as a linear prophage in lysogens
and
possesses
a
protelomerase
(ORF34,
YP_001686770.1) and a partitioning protein (ParA
homolog, ORF33, YP_001686769.1) which are homologous to proteins encoded by VHML and VP882. While
these viruses share some homology with the coliphage P2,
this is largely restricted to the genes associated with tail
morphogenesis V (gpV, W, J, I, H, G) and F operons (gpFI,
FII, E, T, U, D). Based upon their radically different life
cycle from the other P2 phages, we have chosen not to
include them in the Peduovirinae.
5. Bzx1-like or I3-like viruses
Myoviruses are exquisitely rare in the Actinobacteria (only
an estimated 1% of all attempts to isolate phages from
cultures was successful [79]). Phages I3, Bzx1 and Catera
are characterized by heads of 80 nm in diameter and unusually short tails of 80 nm in length with a cup-shaped
base plate. They do not resemble any other mycobacteriophages nor any other myovirus. We propose that this
genus contains the following eight Mycobacterium smegmatis bacteriophages: I3, Bxz1, Cali, Catera, Myrna, Rizal,
ScottMcG and Spud. Phage I3, which has been the first to
be described, is the type virus of the newly proposed myovirus genus although it has not yet been fully sequenced.
Within this assemblage, we identified a distinct subtype
which show >90% protein similarity to Bxz1 (Cali, Catera,
Rizal, ScottMcG and Spud) and genomes of 154-156 kb
[80,81]. Mycobacteriophage Myrna, with a genome of 164
kb, shares approximately 45% of proteins with the Bxz1
subgroup phages. Interesting features include the presence of adenylosuccinate synthase homologs among the
Bxz1 subgroup (gp250) and its absence in the genome of
Myrna. The latter possesses several proteins not present in
the Bxz1 group, including the large hypothetical proteins
gp187 (YP_002225066.1) and gp243 (YP_002225120.1),
a putative nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (gp263,
YP_002225140.1) and ATP-dependent protease (gp262,
YP_002225139.1).
6. phiCD119-like viruses
These are all integrative temperate phages of Clostridium
difficile with genomes ranging from 51-60 kb in size and a
mol%G+C of 28.7-29.4 [82-84]. The genus is named after
its first fully sequenced member. In each case, the electron
micrographs are of poor quality [84,85] or the measurements are very variable with large standard deviations

BMC Microbiology 2009, 9:224

[85]. Virus head diameters are given as 50-65 nm and tail
lengths are said to range from 110 to 210 nm [82-84]. In
certain cases, their annotation is also questionable, The
multiple repressor/antirepressors annotated in the
genomes of CD27 and C2 do not appear to contain
helix-turn-helix or other DNA binding motifs [86]; nor
the presence, in the latter phage, of ParA/ParB homologs.
What unites these viruses, in addition to similar proteomes, is the presence in each of a cytosine-C5 specific
DNA methylase (pfam00145, DNA_methylase, C-5 cytosine-specific DNA methylase; CD119 protein
YP_529611.1) and a DNA replication cassette composed
of three proteins: a DnaD (primosome recruiting protein,
presumably analogous to lambda gpO and P22 gp18;
CD119 protein YP_529603.1), a hypothetical protein
(misidentified in CD27 as a putative resolvase/integrase
and missed entirely in the annotation of CD119) and a
single-stranded DNA binding protein.
7. phiKZ-like viruses
Phages KZ and EL are members of a group of giant
phages isolated, to date, only in Pseudomonas species.
Their heads are isometric, 120 nm in diameter, and they
possess 190 nm-long tails. The phage heads contain an
inner body. The DNA of KZ is over 280 kb in size and has
306 ORFs, most of which are unrelated to ORFS of any
known protein [87], while EL contains 201 ORFs within
its 211 kb genome [88]. These two phages and Pseudomonas phage Lin68 have recently been proposed as part
of a genus "phiKZ viruses" [89]. We now consider that the
differences (number of ORFs, mol%G+C, protein
homologs) between KZ and EL exclude EL from membership in the same genus. Indeed, the recent analysis of
novel Pseudomonas phage 2012-1 [90] showed this phage
to have a strong correlation to KZ (167 similar proteins),
suggesting that it is a true member of the phiKZ virus
genus.
8. PB1-like viruses
This genus is named after the first isolated member of this
group (PB1) [91]. Morphological and DNA-DNA hybridization studies by V. Krylov indicated that the following
Pseudomonas phages were related: E79, 16, 109, 352, 1214,
FS, 71, 337, C17, SL2, B17 [92]. The sequences of a
number of viruses belonging to this genus, namely F8,
BcepF1, PB1, 14-1, LBL3, LMA2, and SN (P.-J. Ceyssens,
personal communication) have now been completed.
None of these phages encodes a recognizable integrase,
suggesting that they are virulent.

Phage F8 is one of the Pseudomonas typing phages from the
Lindberg set which includes six more similar phages
[93,94]. It possesses a 70-nm wide head with visible capsomers and a 138 nm-long tail, four short straight tail fibers and a base plate that separates from the sheath upon

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/224

contraction. The tail exhibits no transverse striations, but
presents a criss-cross pattern [95]. This criss-cross pattern
is a rare feature that has only been observed in phage Felix
O1.
BcepF1 was isolated from soil by enrichment culture [96]
using a Burkholderia ambifaria strain as its host (E.J. Summer and C.F. Gonzalez, unpublished). The BcepF1
genome is 72 kb in size and encodes 127 proteins while
the genome of F8 is 66 kb and encodes 91 proteins [97].
Both genomes are organized into four alternating, unequal gene clusters on the top and bottom strands. The
phages share 43 recognizable homologous proteins. The
shared proteins specify virion morphogenesis, DNA
metabolism and packaging and include a number of
hypothetical proteins of unknown function.
A striking feature of both F8 and BcepF1 is the large
number of small genes, all encoding hypothetical proteins
and clustered together. In BcepF1, the first 20 kb of the
genome, encoding 62 proteins, is devoted almost exclusively to these. In F8, there are two clusters of 8 kb (encoding gp1 through gp16, except gp4, TerL) and 4 kb
(encoding proteins gp77 through gp91) of primarily small
hypothetical novel genes. These heterogeneous regions
are largely responsible for the difference in genome size
and protein content between the two phages. It has generally been assumed that these small proteins are involved
in host take-over (E. Kutter, personal communications)
which appears to be substantiated by the results of Liu and
coworkers [98].
Phages F8 and BcepF1 have some similarity to myophage
BcepB1A, which is itself related in a mosaic fashion to the
Bcep781 group of phages [68]; however, these similarities
are essentially limited to morphogenetic proteins. As in
the Bcep781 phages, several putative tail assembly proteins of F8 and BcepF1 can be linked to those of P2 by PSIBLAST.
C. Single phages
In addition to the phage groups listed above, complete
genome sequences are available for phages without apparent relatives, namely Aggregatibacter (formerly Actinobacillus) phage Aa23; Bacillus thuringiensis phage 03058-36,
Clostridium phages c-st, Escherichia phages EcoM-GJ1 and
rV5; Microcystis phage Ma-LMM01, Ralstonia phage RSL1,
Rhodothermus phage RM378; Streptococcus phage EJ-1, and
Thermus phage YS40. References to these phages may be
found in the NCBI RefSeq database.

General summary
The comparison of proteomes by CoreGenes/CoreExtractor BLASTP programs appears to be a decisive progress in
classifying tailed bacteriophages, i.e., our results corrobo-

Comparison of our results with those of the ICTV (ICTV VIIIth Report, 2005), Proteomic Tree 2 (Edwards and Rohwer, 2005), Phage_Finder
(Fouts, 2006) and phylogeny of terminases (Serwer et al., 2004).

rate the existing ICTV classification of the Myoviridae and
are generally well compatible with other informaticsbased studies (Table 4), like the reticulate clustering based
on gene families [99] (Lima-Mendez, personal communication). Our studies also refine certain relationships and
suggest new ones. Specifically, we propose three new subfamilies (Peduovirinae, Teequatrovirinae, Spounavirinae)
and eight new genera (Bcep781, BcepMu, Bzx1, Felix,
HAP1, PB1, phiCD119 and phiKZ-like viruses). The individualization of genera containing two or three members
as well as of genomic orphans, e.g. coliphage P1 without
apparent homologs, is taxonomically as valuable and
important as the confirmation of the large T4 and P2
groups and in total agreement with previous informaticsbased classifications (Table 4). Our studies once again
prove the utility of the dual CoreGenes/CoreExtractor
approach to defining relationships between large numbers of virus genomes. These relationships carry evolutionary relevance, since our proteomic analyses,
combined with the phylogenetic studies [100], suggest
that the Myoviridae are mainly influenced by vertical evolution rather than by horizontal gene transfer. As observed
in the Cluster dendrogram, the clusters are populated unevenly - several include only one phage while two, the largest, include dozens phages. This reflects the fact that past
phage research has focused on coliphages, and suggests
that we should broaden our research to include phages
from a broader range of bacteria.
Among the 102 analyzed Myoviridae, phage Mu displayed
the most significant evidence of horizontal gene
exchange. This virus is related to three members of pilusspecific Siphoviridae infecting Pseudomonas aeruginosa
(DMS3, D3112, B3 [59,60,101]), sharing 20 to 40% of its
genes with each of them. These phages can be viewed as

true hybrids, produced by recombination of different
ancestors and, like the couple lambda/P22 (to be
described in a future paper), cross family boundaries
based on tail morphology. Nonetheless, the majority of
Myoviridae, when forced to cluster, do so in a logical manner: upgrading of the ICTV genus "P2 phages" to the Pduovirinae with two genera ("P2 viruses" and "HP1 viruses")
is a straightforward proposal and the same is true for the
Spounavirinae (SPO1 viruses and Twort viruses).
Relationships among T4-like phages are more complicated. We reject the postulated inclusion of the cyanophages since their overall similarity to T4 is too low for
consideration, at least according to our criteria. Comeau
and Krisch [29] have recently recognized three groups of
T4-related phages. The "Near T4" group containing the Tevens, Pseudo T-evens, and Schizo T-evens; the "Far T4"
clade including Exo-T4 phage RM378; and, the "Cyano
T4" assemblage. We believe that the latter are sufficiently
different from the other T4 viruses to be excluded from the
Teequatrovirinae at this time. This implies that this subfamily currently contains two distinct genera: T4 and
KVP40 viruses. Within our restricted "T4 phages" genus,
four subtypes were identified (T4-type, 44RR2.8t-type,
RB43-type and the RB49-type viruses). This is confirmed
by the phylogenetic studies of Filée et al. [5] and our
unpublished results. Since these subtypes include different species, no equivalent taxonomic level is currently
available in the official ICTV classification. Perhaps the
introduction of a "subgenus" level should be considered
in order to account for the complexity of T4-related
phages. Alternately, a general elevation of all taxonomic
levels (from the subfamily level) may be envisioned.

This study illustrates the great diversity and biological
richness of tailed phages. The number of independent
genera is not surprising in view of the antiquity of tailed
bacteriophages, which are found in archaea and bacteria
and may predate the separation of these domains. It can
be expected that many more phage groups will be found
or individualized in the future. For example, this study
does not include giant Bacillus phage G, the largest bacterial virus with a genome of 497,513 bp and 684 genes
[102] whose sequence is not yet available for comparison.
We reiterate our statement in our publication on the taxonomy of the Podoviridae, "We highly recommend that the
entire genome of any newly sequenced phage be thoroughly screened (BLASTX) against the Entrez Query
"Viruses [ORGN]" databases to reveal all similarities for
quick identification of potential relationships. A validation step using CoreGenes is essential and more precise
for individual comparisons [2]."

genes between two genomes. The BLASTP stringency setting was set at its default value (75). Proteins containing
at least 132 amino acid residues were subjected to BLASTP
analysis at NCBI or Tulane University.
Hierarchical cluster dendrogram
Cluster analysis was used to visualize the structure of the
proteomic data. We constructed a dissimilarity matrix
from the CoreExtractor matrix. The dissimilarity between
two phage genomes was taken as one (1) minus the average of the two reciprocal correlation scores in the CoreExtractor matrix (Figure S1B). Subsequently, single linkage
hierarchical clustering was performed using "The R Project
for Statistical Computing" software http://www.rproject.org/.

Authors' contributions
Conclusion
Myoviridae can be classified by their proteomes into subfamilies and genera. This classification is in close agreement with ICTV - and other informatics-based
classifications.

All the authors contributed to the writing of this manuscript. RL and AMK planned and executed the comparisons. RL, PM and DS developed the software used. Cluster
dendrograms were generated by PD.

Methods
Phages and bioinformatic tools
This study is limited to the genomes of completely
sequenced, viable Myoviridae from the databases of NCBI
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and the Tulane University
at New Orleans, LA (GT4P, "Genomes of the T4 Phages";
http://phage.bioc.tulane.edu/, excluding prophages without a virion stage. We follow here the ICTV which classifies viable viruses only. Prophages and proviruses,
prophage fragments, defective viruses, phage-like "bacteriocins", virus-like or phage-likes particles from sections or
the environment, viroids, satellite viruses, plasmids, or
transposons, or artificial virus hybrids are not considered.
CoreExtractor and CoreGenes software were used as
described previously [2]. In the case of CoreExtractor, the
BLASTX analysis of phage gene products was performed
using the NCBI Batch BLAST server, http://green
gene.uml.edu/programs/NCBI_Blast.html hosted by the
University of Massachusetts at Lowell, MA. Searches were
performed against the NCBI nonredundant database
(BLOSUM45 matrix, with a 0.05 expectancy cut-off value)
(Additional Figure 2). Several versions of CoreGenes are
available, with each upgrade incorporating previous functions, at http://www.binf.gmu.edu/genometools.html. In
particular, for the current study, a version,
CoreGenes3.0beta, was developed specifically for tallying
the total number of genes contained in the genomes. It
also displays a percent value of genes in common with a
specific genome. Additionally, this version finds unique
