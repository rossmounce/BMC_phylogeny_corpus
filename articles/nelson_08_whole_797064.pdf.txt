Abstract
Background: Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Ap) is an obligate intracellular bacterium and the agent
of human granulocytic anaplasmosis, an emerging tick-borne disease. Ap alternately infects ticks and
mammals and a variety of cell types within each. Understanding the biology behind such versatile
cellular parasitism may be derived through the use of tiling microarrays to establish high resolution,
genome-wide transcription profiles of the organism as it infects cell lines representative of its life
cycle (tick; ISE6) and pathogenesis (human; HL-60 and HMEC-1).
Results: Detailed, host cell specific transcriptional behavior was revealed. There was extensive
differential Ap gene transcription between the tick (ISE6) and the human (HL-60 and HMEC-1) cell
lines, with far fewer differentially transcribed genes between the human cell lines, and all
disproportionately represented by membrane or surface proteins. There were Ap genes exclusively
transcribed in each cell line, apparent human- and tick-specific operons and paralogs, and anti-sense
transcripts that suggest novel expression regulation processes. Seven virB2 paralogs (of the
bacterial type IV secretion system) showed human or tick cell dependent transcription. Previously
unrecognized genes and coding sequences were identified, as were the expressed p44/msp2 (major
surface proteins) paralogs (of 114 total), through elevated signal produced to the unique
hypervariable region of each – 2/114 in HL-60, 3/114 in HMEC-1, and none in ISE6.
Conclusion: Using these methods, whole genome transcription profiles can likely be generated
for Ap, as well as other obligate intracellular organisms, in any host cells and for all stages of the
cell infection process. Visual representation of comprehensive transcription data alongside an
annotated map of the genome renders complex transcription into discernable patterns.

Background
Arthropod-borne intracellular organisms that parasitize
the cells of mammalian hosts must be able to manipulate

a diversity of host cells to support their own growth and
life cycle. Revealing how they accomplish this will illuminate not only pathogenesis but also cell biology.AnaPage 1 of 16

plasma phagocytophilum (Ap) is a gram-negative obligate
intracellular bacterium, the agent of human granulocytic
anaplasmosis (HGA), an emerging tick-borne disease. Ap
has a 1.47 million base pair genome with 1411 annotated
features [1]. Clinically, membrane bound Ap colonies,
called morulae, are seen in peripheral blood neutrophils.
The white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) is considered to be the primary reservoir for the Ap variant responsible for HGA, but other mammals are also susceptible [14]. Ticks do not pass Ap to their offspring, but to mammals they feed upon, which transmit it back to ticks, and
so the organism cycles between tick and mammalian
hosts.
HGA is a potentially severe illness with symptoms, including pancytopenia and limb edema, that suggest other cells
or tissues, beside neutrophils, are infected [5-7] In mice,
Ap infects endothelial cells [8] and human bone marrow
cells support infection in vivo and in vitro [5,9]. The specific cells infected in ticks have not been unambiguously
identified, however evidence indicates they reside within
midgut and salivary gland tissues [10-12]. Tick cell lines
have been developed that support Ap replication, including ISE6, which was isolated from Ixodes scapularis, the primary vector of HGA in North America [13]. Susceptible
human cell lines include HL-60, a promyelocytic leukemia cell line that serves as a model for neutrophils, and
the microvascular endothelial cell line HMEC-1 [14]. Ap
produces distinct infection phenotypes and growth kinetics in these cell lines, suggesting, along with its broad host
range, that the organism adapts to each host by shifting its
gene expression.
The obligate intracellular lifestyle of Ap makes direct biochemical, genetic, and observational study approaches
inherently difficult. Transformation of Ap with fluorescent
reporters has recently been achieved and should improve
visualization of live bacteria, and open avenues for
directed genetic research [15]. Nevertheless, methods for
functional genomic analysis, for example, specific gene
knockout, are still lacking. Gene transcription and expression analyses in animal models are largely impractical
because Ap levels in tick and mammal tissues are too low
for recovery of sufficient bacterial RNA or protein. In vitro
studies have focused on characterization of the immunodominant p44/msp2 genes, which encode a large family of
major surface proteins whose expression varies according
to whether the organisms were derived from tick or mammalian host cells [16]. In addition, genes encoding the
type IV secretion system of Ap have been identified, transcriptionally analyzed, and described [17,18], but their
function and regulation remain undefined. DNA microarrays have been used to measure changes in host cell gene
transcription during infection, with an aim to infer the
mechanisms and strategies applied by Ap [19-24], but no

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/364

microarray studies that directly measure Ap transcription
have been published.
The release of an annotated Ap genome sequence [1], and
development of maskless, photolithographic, digital light
processor technology (DLP) [25] have made it feasible to
characterize global transcript levels in Ap using tiling
microarrays [26,27]. With these technologies entire
genomes can be probed instead of sampling only selected
sequences. The continuous data generated can be plotted
in genomic order as a line graph, with transcribed genes
appearing as peaks rising from a baseline of non-transcribed or intergenic sequence, and peak height corresponding to relative transcript abundance. A direct
alignment of this to a parallel, annotated map of the
genome can provide a visually striking and intuitive way
to assess the data. Through Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA)
and NimbleGen Systems, Inc. (Madison, WI), we
designed a tiling microarray for the entire genome of Ap
(1.47 Mbp) and characterized Ap gene transcription in
three cell lines representative of its life cycle (ISE6 tick)
and pathogenesis in humans (HL-60 and HMEC-1).

Methods
Cell lines, Ap strain, and growth conditions
Sterile and Ap-infected HL-60 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA; ATCC CCL-240) were
maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 25 mM HEPES. Cultures infected with Ap isolate HZ were subcultured weekly
by 1:50 (v/v) dilution of > 90% infected cells into sterile
HL-60 cultures [28]. The HMEC-1 cell line was received
from the Centers for Disease Control (Atlanta, GA), and
both sterile and infected cells likewise cultured in RPMI
1640 medium with 10% FBS and 25 mM HEPES [29].
Infected HMEC-1 cultures were fed daily and Ap subcultured 1:50 bi-weekly when > 80% of cells were infected.
HL-60 and HMEC-1 cultures were kept at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. ISE6 cells were
propagated in L15B300 medium with 5% tryptose phosphate broth (BD, Sparks MD, USA), 5% FBS, and 0.1%
lipoprotein concentrate (MPBiomedical, Irvine CA, USA)
at 34°C [13]. Ap-infected ISE6 cultures were fed twice
weekly with medium buffered to pH 7.6 using 0.25%
NaHCO3 and 25 mM HEPES, and subcultured 1:50 biweekly [13].

Ap strain HZ was cultured from the blood of a New York
state patient by co-culture with HL-60 [Goodman et al.
unpublished; [28] ] HZ-Ap-infected HL-60 cells (passage
8) were simultaneously inoculated into the three cell
lines. These infected parallel cultures were continuously
subcultured and served as the source of infected cell samples for tiling array analysis. All samples from each cell
line were from Ap cultures between passages 21 and 34.

Tiling array design and manufacture
Through consultation with Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA),
a library of 258,480 complimentary (perfect match) 25mer oligonucleotide probes covering both DNA strands of
the Ap genome (isolate HZ) [1] was designed. Each probe
overlapped its neighbor by 11 bases for a probe resolution
of 14 bases, the distance from the center of one probe to
the next. Probes were "hard pruned" – ridden of highly
repetitive sequence elements thought to be irrelevant
using an algorithm (Affymetrix) to identify, somewhat
subjectively, long repeat sequences. Probes for these were
not included, though probes for many "shorter" repeating
sequences were. Pruned sequences can be viewed easily in
the Artemis graphs. They are characterized by successive
data points with the same or similar value that together
produce large blunt peaks. For examples see additional
file 1 coordinates 665858–666184, 1025792–1026289,
and 645698–646032. NimbleGen Systems, Inc. (Madison, WI) synthesized the oligonucleotide probes in situ
using a photo-mediated, maskless process in which the
synthesis of each probe is directed by a digital light processor [25].
Isolation of RNA
Ap genomic transcription was measured in each of the
three cell lines when cultures were approximately 95%
infected. Typically, cells contained hundreds of bacteria
(Figure 1: Microscopic images of Giemsa stained cells
infected with Ap). RNA was extracted from three Apinfected and three uninfected samples of each cell line (18
samples total). Each sample was from a separate culture
and consisted of approximately 107 infected cells or uninfected control cells. Cells were suspended by pipetting
(HL-60 and ISE6) or with a cell scraper (HMEC-1) and
immediately centrifuged at 300 × g for 2 minutes. The
supernatant was aspirated and discarded; cell pellets were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/364

loosened by flicking and immediately dissolved in TRI
REAGENT™ (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA). All steps were
performed at room temperature. Total RNA was then isolated according to the TRI REAGENT™ product instructions. In brief, samples in TRI REAGENT™ were extracted
with chloroform and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 minutes at 4°C. RNA in the aqueous, upper phase was precipitated in isopropanol, collected by centrifugation at
12,000 × g for 10 minutes at 4°C, and washed twice in
cold 75% ethanol. RNA pellets were dissolved in 100 μL
RNase-free water, quantified by spectrophotometry, and
processed for array analysis.
Preparation of tiling array "target"
Total RNA from Ap-infected or sterile control cells was
processed for Ap transcript measurement according to the
Affymetrix "Prokaryotic Target Preparation" protocol
using random priming of total RNA to synthesize a single
strand of cDNA. The cDNA was recovered by column purification, fragmented with DNase I, and end labeled with
biotin. These biotinylated cDNA fragment "targets" were
hybridized to the "probes" contained on the tiling arrays,
labeled with a streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate, and
probe hybridization was quantified by laser scanning. The
detailed protocol was as follows.
cDNA synthesis
In a volume of 30 μL, 10 μg of total RNA (from Ap infected
or sterile control cells) was combined with random primers (25 ng/μL final concentration) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA), and, in a thermocycler, incubated 10 minutes at
70°C followed by 10 minutes at 25°C, then chilled to
4°C. To this reaction mixture was added 30 μL of the following master mix: 12 μL 5× 1st Strand Buffer, 6 μL 100
mM DTT, 3 μL 10 mM dNTPs, 1.5 μL SUPERaseIn™ (20U/
μL) (Ambion, Austin TX, USA), 7.5 μL SuperScript II (200

U/μL) (Invitrogen). Samples (60 μL) were incubated in a
thermocycler 10 minutes at 25°C, 60 minutes at 37°C, 60
minutes at 42°C, 10 minutes at 70°C, and chilled to 4°C.
cDNA isolation and fragmentation
To degrade RNA, 20 μL of 1N NaOH was added to each
sample, incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes, and neutralized by addition of 20 μL 1N HCl. MiniElute PCR Purification Columns (Qiagen, Valencia CA, USA) were used
according to product instructions to purify cDNA from the
samples. Typical cDNA yields were 3–4 μg. cDNA in 10 μL
was combined with 2 μL 10× One-Phor-All Buffer (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ), 0.6 U DNase I/μg
cDNA (Amersham Biosciences), plus sufficient water for
20 μL total volume, and incubated 10 minutes at 37°C.
DNase I was inactivated by heating to 98°C for 10 minutes. cDNA fragments produced were 50–200 bases in
length.
Biotinylation of 3' termini of cDNA fragments
The GeneChip® DNA labeling kit (Affymetrix) was used as
follows: 20 μL fragmented cDNA was combined with 10
μL 5× reaction buffer, 2 μL 7.5 mM GeneChip DNA labeling reagent, 2 μL terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase,
and 16 μL water and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.
The reaction was stopped with 2 μL of 0.5 M EDTA and
then frozen at -20°C until it was applied to an array.

graph of the entire, annotated Ap genome during infection
of HL-60, HMEC-1, and ISE6 cell lines). The complete
genome coverage provided by the overlapping probes on
the tiling array translates into 90 spot intensities generated for a 1000 base open reading frame (ORF). This large
number of intensities, coupled with the quality of data
suggested that creating a linear graph, and measuring the
area under the peaks in regions corresponding to annotated open reading frames – ORF transcription areas –
would be a simple and useful method to quantify transcripts for each ORF. To compute these ORF transcription
areas, the intensities were normalized via quantiles [30]
and imported into the IgorPro data analysis program
(WaveMetrics Lake Oswego OR, USA) along with the ORF
and structural RNA annotations available from http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. A script was written to index a
trapezoidal integration algorithm of the intensity list with
the start and end genomic positions indicated on the
annotation. This script operation generated a list of 1411
transcription areas.

Tiling array hybridization and scanning
Samples were hybridized to tiling arrays and scanned at
the BioMedical Genomics Center at the University of Minnesota using the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400. Arrays
were scanned using an Affymetrix Genechip 3000 scanner
according to standard Affymetrix protocols.

Statistical evaluation of area differences, T values & Fold
change
ORF transcription areas computed from the quantile normalized data (3 each for HL-60, HMEC-1 and ISE6) and
paired 2 tail Students t-test, were performed on: HL-60 vs.
ISE6, HMEC-1 vs. ISE6, and HL-60 vs. HMEC-1. ORF transcription area comparisons with p values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant for determination of the number and
identity of genes transcribed. Determination of differentially expressed genes utilized the additional requirement
that the mean ORF transcription area be at least twice the
mean ORF transcription area of the same gene of the compared cell line.

Tiling array data analysis
"Cel" files generated by the University of Minnesota's
microarray facility were joined to Affymetrix BPMAP files
specific to the tiling array using Affymetrix® Tiling Analysis
Software (TAS). TAS generated a list of signal intensities
and arranged them in order of genomic location and DNA
strand. The data are available at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (study #GSE11487 http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/query/
acc.cgi?acc=GSE11487).

The number of expressed ORFs was determined by T-test
comparison between the ORF transcription areas from
infected cell monolayers, and those of uninfected control
cell monolayers. The signal intensity of these arrays was
baseline corrected using the signal intensities of twelve
manually selected intergenic regions devoid of obvious
signal from across the span of the genome. ORF transcription area comparisons with p values ≤ 0.05 were considered significant for determination of the number and
identity of genes transcribed.

Graphical representation of these data along with their
annotations was accomplished with the JAVA based program "Artemis" http://www.sanger.ac.uk/. Using a script
developed internally, the intensity plots were reformatted
and imported into Artemis along with an annotation feature list http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The resulting
graphics give a visual overview of transcription as it relates
to genomic organization, and provide clues to operon
structure (see additional file 1: Artemis transcription

Validation of tiling array data by quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR)
Five Ap genes with known products were assayed for relative transcript abundance by qRT-PCR. Tiling data indicated that four of the genes had differential transcription
patterns between the human and tick cells: major outer
membrane protein (omp-1A; APH_1359), outer membrane efflux protein (APH_1110), major surface protein 4
(msp4; APH_1240), and the 60 kDa chaperonin

(APH_0240). The fifth gene, which codes for succinyl-CoA
synthetase beta subunit (APH_1052), was transcribed
equally in all three cell lines (Figure 2; Artemis transcription profiles for five genes chosen for assay by qRT-PCR).
Total RNA (from portions of samples prepared for array
analysis), from three separate cultures of each Ap-infected
cell line (9 samples), were assayed in triplicate by qRTPCR. To eliminate any DNA contamination, samples were
DNase I treated using DNA-free™ (Ambion). DNase I was
inactivated and RNA purified using RNeasy mini columns
(Qiagen, Valentia, CA). mRNA from each of the five genes
was reverse transcribed and amplified quantitatively with
primers designed using MacVector (Cary, NC) and
Netprimer (Palo Alto, CA) (see additional file 2: qRT-PCR
primers). The primers were tested by conventional PCR
on a Stratagene (La Jolla CA, USA) Robocycler with temperature gradient capability, using Ap strain HZ DNA as
target. Formation of appropriate product sizes was verified and a single annealing temperature (60°C) and
primer concentration (150 nM) suitable for all five primer
pairs were determined, allowing RNA from each of the cell
lines to be qRT-PCR-amplified together for best determination of relative transcript levels. Reverse transcription
and subsequent quantitative PCR were performed on 100
ng of each RNA sample in 96-well plates using the Brilliant II SYBR Green 1-step qRT-PCR kit (Stratagene), and
Stratagene's Mx3005P thermal cycler. To initiate the qRTPCR, reverse transcription was allowed to proceed for 30
minutes at 50°C, followed by heat treatment for 10 minutes at 95°C to activate DNA polymerase and deactivate
reverse transcriptase. cDNA was then amplified during 40
cycles of 30 seconds at 95°C, 1 minute at 60°C, and 1
minute at 72°C.

Percentage of Ap genes measured as transcribed in each
cell line
Of the 1411 annotated features [1] in the Ap genome, 983
(69.6%) were significantly transcribed (p-value ≤ 0.05) in
HL-60, 620 (43.9%) in HMEC-1, and 974 (69.0%) in
ISE6, compared to negative control samples (RNA from
uninfected cells).
Differential Ap gene transcription between cell lines
Between HL-60 and HMEC-1, 71 Ap ORFs (5%) were differentially (p-value ≤ 0.05) transcribed (see additional file
3: Ap-HL-60 vs. Ap-HMEC-1 differential transcription).
Between HL-60 and ISE6, 585 Ap ORFs (41.5%) were differentially transcribed. Between HMEC-1 and ISE6, 304
Ap ORFs (21.5%) were differentially transcribed. Adding
a fold change criterion of 2 or greater, only one Ap gene
between Ap from HL-60 (Ap-HL-60) and Ap from HMEC1 (Ap-HMEC-1) passed: APH_1342, one of the p44/msp2
paralogs. Between Ap-HL-60 and Ap from ISE6 (Ap-ISE6),

117 ORFs (8.5%), and between Ap-HMEC-1 and Ap-ISE6,
61 (4.3%) were at least 2-fold different (Table 1). The relatively low percentage of ORFs measured as transcribed in
Ap-HMEC-1 (43.9%) was probably due to lower average
signal intensity from those samples (850 vs. 2120 in HL60). We determined this to be the result of suboptimal
biotin labeling after using a particular batch of terminal
transferase. A new aliquot of terminal transferase used in
the preparation of one of the samples of Ap-HL-60 produced a particularly bright signal, resulting in a higher signal to noise ratio for the Ap-HL-60 data. Because of this,
and because differential transcription was low between
the human cell lines (compared to that between the
human and tick cell lines), subsequent descriptions of differential transcription in Ap-ISE6 are based on comparisons to Ap-HL-60.
Of the 117 Ap ORFs differentially transcribed (p ≤ 0.05, ≥
two-fold difference) between the HL-60 and ISE6 cells, 76
had higher levels in HL-60 and 41 had higher levels in
ISE6. The 76 Ap-HL-60 ORFs comprise 35 known and 41
hypothetical proteins (54%). All but three of the ORFs
that were up-regulated in Ap-ISE6 are annotated as hypothetical (93%) (see Table 2: Genes differentially transcribed between human (HL-60) and tick (ISE6) cells). By
comparison, 40% of all Ap genes are annotated as hypothetical.
The amino acid sequences derived from the 117 differentially transcribed genes were analyzed using the secretomeP CBS prediction server [31] and the CELLO
subcellular localization predictor [32] to determine the
probable cellular location of each of the gene products –
periplasm, inner or outer membrane, extracellular
(secreted), or cytoplasmic. While 25% of all Ap genes
products are membrane associated (non cytoplasmic),
43% of the 76 genes differentially transcribed in HL-60
cells and 46% of the 41 genes differentially transcribed in
ISE6 cells code for non cytoplasmic proteins. As illustrated
in Table 2, the greater a gene's differential transcription,
the more likely it was to encode a membrane associated
protein (i.e. differentially transcribed genes were over-represented by membrane associated proteins; see Table 2:

Summary of Ap-HL-60 vs. Ap-ISE6 differential gene transcription).
As illustrated in the Artemis transcript level graphs (see
additional file 1: materials for graphing transcript level
data in Artemis), when the data are displayed as linear
graphs alongside a map of the annotated genome, numerous transcription behaviors are revealed. Transcribed
sequences are seen to rise from the over-all flat baseline
and generally correspond well to annotated ORFs. However, there are examples of transcript signal extending
beyond ORF boundaries (APH_ numbers 0005, 0406,
0793, 0808, 0811, 0859, 0906, and 1151), transcription
apparently not associated with an ORF (coordinates
46672–46738, 944100–944549, 692299–692983, and
1306128–1306875), and transcribed unannotated ORFs
(875684–876751, 1445252–1445797 and 1241148–
1241727). The ORF identified between coordinates
1241148 and 1241727 is another p44/msp2 paralog,
bringing the total number of p44 loci now identified to
114 (113 were originally annotated; [1]. Peaks and plateaus of varying profile representing gene transcription are
clearly discernible. Often they slope downward from 5' to
3', but sometimes they are flat (Figure 3: Examples of flat
and sloped transcription peaks). There are also numerous
ORFs and operons that showed no significant transcription in any of the cell lines (see additional file 4: genes
and operons with no detected transcripts).
Paralogs of the p44/msp2 family of outer membrane proteins form a characteristic hybridization pattern that is
somewhat perplexing. Since p44 is abundantly expressed
in Ap, transcripts with sequences that correspond to the
conserved ends of the gene should bind to all the probes
on the array that are complimentary – i.e., those of over
100 genes. Signals associated with the conserved ends of
the p44 paralogs do rise sharply, while those that correspond to the hypervariable region (HVR) in between are
generally near baseline. This produces a double horn
shaped signature. Most paralogs are not expressed within
a population of bacteria [33] therefore those that display
bridged horns – representing transcript hybridization to
the HVR – are likely to be specifically transcribed. In HL60, APH_1152 (similar to p44-47) and APH_1351 (simi-

Genes differentially transcribed (p ≤ 0.05, ≥ two-fold difference) between human (HL-60) and tick (ISE6) cells. Gene products (117) are listed in
descending order of their transcript abundance in HL-60, with their fold change indicated in the right hand column. Gene products 1–76 were those
more highly transcribed in HL-60, and 77–117 were those more highly transcribed in ISE6. Gene products predicted to be membrane associated (in
bold) tended to be those most differentially transcribed – at the top (most abundant in Ap-HL-60) and bottom (most abundant in Ap-ISE6) of the
list. The percentages of hypothetical genes, and the percentages of gene products that are membrane associated are also indicated. (~25% of all Ap
genes code for proteins that are membrane associated.)

HVRs, suggesting those paralogs were expressed. Ap-ISE6
produced no significant hybridization to any of the p44
HVRs, however along with Ap-HL-60 and Ap-HMEC-1, ApISE6 produced strong signals to the conserved p44
sequences. In all three cell lines, signals to the conserved
p44 sequences were greater than those from the HVRs – of
the expressing paralogs noted in Ap-HL-60 and Ap-HMEC1. In addition, this pattern of excessive hybridization to
the conserved ends of the p44 ORFs, is "reflected" in the
non-coding DNA strand. Probes to sequences opposite
conserved p44 sense sequences are hybridized significantly in the human cell samples, and as strongly in the
tick cells as the sense probes, such that the horned profile
appears reflected in the opposite DNA strand. (Figure 4:

in APH_1343, but strong conserved sequence associated signals (horns), is typical of most p44 paralogs. An unannotated
segment of p44 conserved sequence lies between APH_1343
and APH_1344 (yellow) on the minus strand. It also showed
strong sense (B) and anti-sense (A) signals. APH_1344 and

sense strand (B) but not on the anti-sense strand (A).

1418814–1420199). Subtler reflecting was also seen in
several non-p44 ORFs, such as APH_1387, which codes for
outer membrane protein HGE2 [1], and the hypothetical
APH_0536 (Figure 5: Reflecting).
Like conserved p44 sequences, repeat sequences, which
are common throughout the genome, generally displayed
strong signals on both DNA strands (see additional file 5:
Repeat-sequence-based sense and anti sense signal).
At the p44 expression locus (APH_1221) both Ap-HL-60
and Ap-HMEC-1 showed strong transcription beginning
near base 1289280, just before the start of the omp-1N
gene, and continuing through the p44 expression site,
while Ap-ISE6 did not. The p44 "horns" seen in Ap-ISE6
within the expression locus, are likely examples of the
generalized hybridization to conserved p44 sequence
noted above. The tr1 gene (APH_1218) upstream of the
p44 expression locus, which encodes a putative transcription regulator [34], is well transcribed by Ap-ISE6 but not
by Ap-HL-60 or Ap-HMEC-1. The DNA binding protein

somewhat less so in Ap-HL-60, and only marginally in ApISE6. This Ap gene encodes a protein that is translocated
to the nucleus of infected HL-60 cells [35,36] and phosphorylated there within minutes [37], presumably as an
effector molecule delivered via the Ap type IV secretion
system [38]. Located between genome coordinates
1194300 and 1203600 are eight paralogs of the TrbC/
VirB2 gene family (pfam04956), six of which showed
measurable transcript levels either only in the tick cell line
(APH_1131 – APH_1134), or the human cell lines
(APH_1144 and APH_1145). The relationship by amino
acid sequence of these eight paralogs is illustrated in Figure 7 (Phylogenetic tree of eight virB2 paralogs by amino
acid sequence), and indicates those transcribed in ISE6 are
more closely related to each other than those transcribed
in HL-60 and HMEC-1. Amino acid sequence alignments
for the eight virB2 paralogs of Ap (see additional file 6)
show identities that rank from a high of 93% between tick

there is a ribosomal binding site at coordinate 1445120.
This upstream area shows significant amino acid sequence
homology with the N-termini of the other ORF members
of this putative operon, also suggesting the sequence is
part of that ORF. Between coordinates 1445252 and
1445797 an un-annotated ORF appears to be transcribed
only in the tick cell line, and also shows significant
homology to the other ORFs in this putative operon. If
this is a true ORF, and the start of APH_1380 is extended
to coordinate 1445107, the two putative ORFs APH_1381
and APH_1382 on the positive DNA strand may not be
true ORFs, since they are situated opposite coding
sequences in the operon and showed no transcription signal (see additional file 7 panel A). The other apparent tick
specific operon includes locus tags APH_0726 through
APH_0720 (see additional file 7 panel B). All but the
small locus tags APH_0721 and APH_0722 were transcribed. Although these genes are also annotated as
encoding hypothetical proteins, searches using SignalP
[39] and TMHMM [40] prediction servers indicated they
all have transmembrane domains. There was also a group
of Ap genes transcribed only in the human cells:
APH_0837, APH_0838, APH_0839, and APH_0842 (see
additional file 7 panel C). All encode hypothetical proteins and all are related by amino acid sequence, especially APH_0838, APH_0839, and APH_0842.
qRT-PCR
Relative transcript levels for the five selected Ap genes,
within and between cell lines, confirm those indicated by
the array data (Figure 8; Tiling vs. qRT-PCR graphs).

Discussion
cell expressed paralogs APH_1133 and APH_1134, and a
low of 22% between non-expressed APH_1136 and
human cell expressed APH_1145. Multiple alignment
showed higher identity and similarity between the C termini of paralogs, which contain the functional portion of
the proteins.
Two apparent tick-cell-specific operons were identified.
ORFs between coordinates 1448342 and 1445170, which
include locus tags APH_1386 through APH_1382, were
transcribed only in the tick cell line (see additional file 7:
Tick- and human-specific Ap operons). Locus tag
APH_1380 appears to be part of the operon and as such
was transcribed in the tick cell line, and, at a lower level in
the human cell lines. The functions of the hypothetical
proteins of these six ORFs are not known. However, a
BLAST homology search produced E values of 9e-18 to 4e9, indicating the six ORFs are related. The transcription
profile around APH_1380 and sequence characteristics
just up-stream, suggest that the ORF actually begins with
the methionine at coordinate 1445107. In support of this,

Total RNA from Ap infected human and tick cells was used
to establish host cell specific Ap transcription profiles by
hybridization to complementary oligonucleotides representing the entire genome of Ap on tiling arrays. The high
percentages of genes measured as transcribed (69.6% in
HL-60, 43.9% in HMEC-1, and 69.0% in ISE6), and the
low levels of hybridization produced by the uninfected
control samples, demonstrate that the method and array
design produced sensitive, consistent, and specific transcription measurements. This is encouraging since efforts
to fractionate or amplify RNA samples inevitably skew
results. However, the culture samples analyzed were heavily infected and therefore optimal for such a direct
approach. The three cell lines – HL-60 human promyelocytic, HMEC-1 human microvascular endothelial, and
ISE6 tick – each produced bacteria with distinct transcription profiles, suggesting that Ap gene expression is closely
dependent on the phenotype and genotype (species origin) of its host cell. The bacteria assayed were not synchronized, they were the result of 1:50 inoculations, and
therefore the transcription profiles generated were an

average, perhaps with a "late stage" bias, of the infection
process in each cell line.
Transcription profiles between the two human cell lines
appeared similar, however with better and more consistent biotin labeling the percentage of Ap ORFs transcribed
in HMEC-1 (43.9%) is predicted to be closer to that seen
in HL-60 and ISE6 (~70%), and differences in transcription profiles between Ap-HL-60 and Ap-HMEC-1 would
be magnified to reveal additional essential characteristics
of Ap transcription in the human promyelocytic versus
endothelial cells. Transcription differences between the
human and tick cells were extensive; there were many
genes and apparent operons transcribed in the tick cells
but not in the human cells, and vice versa. The fact that the
vast majority of tick cell specific transcripts are for hypothetical genes is tantalizing, and likely reflects our ignorance of the molecular patho-physiology of ticks and their
associated bacteria.
The observation that in all three cell lines some Ap genes
and operons remained inactive, is either an indication
that there are genetic capabilities not called for by these in
vitro infection conditions – the particular intracellular
environments of each cell line and the laboratory growth
conditions – or the failure of this method to measure the

transcription of those genes. Genes and operons that were
truly silent may, among other possibilities, encode products specific to earlier stages of infection, to colonization
of ticks following blood-meal uptake, or to parasitism of
different hosts. Given the distinct transcription profiles
produced between the human and tick cells, and the
diversity of animal hosts and cell types infected within
each, all are possible explanations.
The virB2 paralogs of the type IV secretion system (T4SS)
identified as differentially transcribed (6 of 8) between
the human and tick cells (APH_1144 and APH_1145, and
APH_1131 – APH_1134, respectively) represent host cell
specific usage of type IV secretion system components.
VirB2 is the major protein that makes up the T4SS pilus,
and has been shown to be necessary for full virulence in
Brucella abortus [41]. In Ap, seven of the eight virB2 paralogs are annotated as being TrbC/VirB2 (pfam04956) family members on the Entrez Protein entries for each
individual protein. APH_1145, although not annotated as
virB2, shares homology with and is located next to the
other seven. Several other bacteria within the family Anaplasmataceae also possess multiple paralogs of virB2,
which is unusual, as the majority of bacteria with type IV
secretion systems have only one or two virB2 genes. A
blast search done with APH_1133 shows, for example,

that Anaplasma marginale, as well as Ehrlichia and Wolbachia species, also have multiple loci annotated as TrbC/
VirB2 family members (see additional file 8: Examples of
other Anaplasmataceae bacteria with multiple virB2 loci).
These bacteria might also express specific virB2 paralogs in
a host cell dependent manner.
The absence of p44 transcription in ISE6 at the p44 expression locus and clear transcription in HL-60 and HMEC-1,
is consistent with the observation that the tick cell samples produced little or no hybridization to p44 HVRs,
while the human samples did, and indicates that in ISE6
little if any transcript was generated from any of the 22
full-length p44 genes. The lack of ApxR transcript in the
tick cells is consistent with the findings of Wang et al.,
who performed quantitative reverse transcription PCR on
Ap-infected ISE6 cells and tick salivary glands and found
that ApxR is not transcribed [34]. It was suggested that
ApxR generally regulates transcription in mammalian host
cells and specifically regulates p44 transcription by binding to the tr1 promoter. The strong transcription of tr1 in
the tick cells in this study may be due to a lack of suppression by ApxR, which is not transcribed in the tick cells. The
function of tr1, therefore, is unclear.
The apparent over-representation of transcript from conserved p44 sequences, along with its reflecting behavior in
the anti-sense strand, is unexpected. It may be the result of
transcriptional "read-through" followed by the formation
of stable double stranded, conserved sequence RNA. Bacteria are known to have poor control over transcription
termination, and transcription of anti-sense sequence has
been identified in Mycoplasma genitalium [42]. Since p44
paralogs are scattered throughout the genome on both
DNA strands, any adjacent gene transcription that continues into sense or anti-sense p44 sequences will create

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/364

"false transcripts," the conserved sequences of which are
complementary. Conserved anti-sense false transcript
may anneal to conserved sense "true" and false transcript
to form double stranded conserved sequence RNA, which
is relatively stable compared to single stranded RNA and
thus would accumulate in the bacteria (Figure 9: Diagram
of possible mechanism to explain the over-representation
of p44 conserved sequence transcripts and their anti-sense
counterparts). Sense and anti-sense p44 false transcripts
could come from many of the numerous p44 paralogs, but
a possible source of anti-sense p44 transcript in the tick
cells is via read-through from the msp4 gene (see additional file 9: msp4 transcription), which is opposite and
just downstream of p44-15b and p44-13, strongly transcribed in the tick cells, not transcribed in the human
cells, and has no obvious transcription terminator.
It is possible that the anti-sense transcription noted in
some genes, along with the prominent p44 transcription
phenomena, function to regulate gene expression. In
prokaryotes, cis- and trans-encoded anti-sense transcripts
regulate coding sequence lying directly opposite or elsewhere in the genome, respectively [43]. Although antisense mediated expression regulation mechanisms are
poorly understood, some possible modes have been discussed and include: imprinting through DNA methylation, RNA processing interference, and ribosome
interference [44,45]. In the case of p44, anti-sense transcripts may serve to silence leaky expression occurring
from any of the 22 identified full-length p44 paralogs [1],
which are apparently capable of being expressed independently from the p44 expression locus [46]. P44 silencing may be especially important in tick cells and account
for the particular abundance of anomalous p44 conserved
sequence transcripts in Ap-ISE6, which showed no p44
HVR transcription. Sense and anti-sense RNA homolo-

"Read through" transcription of genes lying just upstream of anti-sense p44 sequence (e.g. "Gene 1" and msp4) may produce
anti-sense p44 transcript, which, together with p44 sense transcript, forms double stranded RNA (dsRNA). Because the HVR
sequences are not complementary they do not form dsRNA and are therefore degraded. However, the conserved, complementary sequences do form dsRNA so are stabilized, accumulate in the bacteria, and are measured as over-abundant by the
arrays.

gous to the conserved ends of the p44 genes may even
facilitate the process of non-reciprocal recombination by
which p44 paralogs move into and out of the expression
locus [47]. If they are not purposeful, it is likely that these
gene transcription phenomena are the result of poorly
controlled transcription or are artifacts of the tiling arrays.
The repeat sequence associated sense and anti-sense "transcripts" do appear to be an artifact of the tiling arrays, as
they are consistently seen wherever repeat sequences
occur, whether inside or outside of coding sequences.
However, the transcription behavior of p44 is unique in
the genome, and most genes do not display anti-sense
transcription, therefore the over-representation of transcript to conserved p44 sequences and its reflection, and
the anti-sense transcription of some genes, are intriguing
and merit further investigation.

Conclusion
Obligate intracellular pathogens like Ap control the cells
they parasitize – to prevent immune attacks, divert cellular resources, and prevent host cells from apoptosing. Our
understanding of tick genes is poor so it is not surprising
that the up-regulated Ap genes in tick cells are nearly all
"hypothetical." Matched with our limited understanding
of Ap genes, the tick cell data are particularly difficult to
interpret. Conversely, it makes sense that the most differentially active Ap genes in HL-60 cells are better characterized, since human cell lines have mainly been used to
study the biology of Ap, and, perhaps, Ap genes evolved to
interact in human cells would tend to be related to characterized effectors. It also makes sense that the differentially transcribed Ap genes in HL-60 and ISE6 are overrepresented by membrane associated gene products, since
survival in such disparate host cells would seem to require
substantial specialization at the interface of the organism
with its host cell: the bacterial membrane. The fact that a
majority of Ap genes have no known function poses the
greatest challenge to interpreting these data. However,
some things are clear: 1. Genes differentially transcribed
between the human and tick cells disproportionately represent surface proteins (~45% compared to ~25% of all
proteins) (Table 2). 2. There are genes, paralogs, and operons exclusively transcribed in the tick and the human
cells, some of which may encode excellent vaccine candidates. 3. The particular paralogs of the p44 family of membrane proteins (114) expressed in a population of Ap may
be identified by the elevated signal produced within the
HVR of each as compared to silent paralogs. 4. Whole
RNA isolated from Ap infected host cells can be used to
reveal details of bacterial gene transcription, including
that from anti-sense sequences. 5. Global transcription
profiles can likely be generated for Ap in any host cells,
and for all aspects of the cell infection cycle – cell binding,
entry, growth, and escape – although some enrichment
for bacteria or bacterial mRNA may be necessary. Cou-

pling Ap transcription data with that of infected host cells
will facilitate the discovery of Ap and host cell gene functions.
Having transcription data for all of an organism's DNA
sequence allows a line graph display for both DNA strands
parallel to an annotated map of the genome. This way one
can readily see transcriptional behavior that may be less
accessible through other analysis tools. For example, antisense transcription, and the variation in transcription profiles of genes – sloped, flat, horned, and reflected – may
lead to important insights into Ap gene regulation, as well
as for other intracellular organisms that subvert host cell
processes for their own benefit.
