Abstract
Background: Methylation at certain human CpG rich sequences increases with age. The
mechanisms underlying such age-related changes are unclear, but methylation may accumulate
slowly in a clock-like manner from birth and record lifetime numbers of stem cell divisions.
Alternatively, methylation may fluctuate in response to environmental stimuli. The relative stability
of methylation patterns may be inferred through serial observations of the same colon.
Case presentation: A 22 year-old male with attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis received
neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation prior to surgery for rectal adenocarcinoma. Colon crypt
methylation patterns before and after neo-adjuvant therapy (62 days apart) were essentially
identical with respect to percent methylation and diversity. Consistent with previous studies,
methylation patterns recorded no evidence for enhanced colon crypt stem cell survival with a
germline mutation (codon 215) proximal to the mutation cluster region of APC.
Conclusion: The inability of neo-adjuvant therapy to significantly alter crypt methylation patterns
suggests stem cells are relatively protected from transient environmental changes. Age-related
methylation appears to primarily reflect epigenetic errors in stem cells that slowly accumulate in a
clock-like manner from birth. Therefore, life-long human stem cell histories are potentially written
within and may be read from somatic cell epigenomes.

Background
Recent studies reveal methylation of certain CpG rich
sequences increases with age in normal human colon
[1,2]. These CpG rich sequences, like most CpG islands
[3], are unmethylated at birth and appear to somatically
accumulate cytosine methylation over many years. The
etiology of such age-related methylation is uncertain, but
one possible mechanism is random somatic errors during
DNA replication [4]. By this mechanism, methylation
would inherently increase with cell division because the
CpG rich sequences are initially unmethylated. Consistent

with random replication errors, methylation patterns (the
5' to 3' order of methylation) differ between cells within
the same colon [4] and overall levels increase with age
[1,2].
Random epigenetic errors potentially records cell histories
because methylation exhibits somatic inheritance [3].
Daughter cells generally inherit the same methylation pattern as their parents, but rarely replication errors occur
which are subsequently passed to progeny (Figure 1).
Somatic errors can only accumulate within stem cells

Somatic 1 inheritance of methylation patterns
Figure cell
Somatic cell inheritance of methylation patterns. The tags used in this study are unmethylated at birth (unmethylated CpG sites
represented by open circles, with filled circles representing methylated sites). Generally the same methylation pattern is faithfully copied and passed on to daughter cells. However, random epigenetic errors may occur, and these errors are also subsequently inherited. Methylation patterns (5' to 3' order of methylation) potentially encode numbers of divisions since birth and
ancestral relationships between cells. Of note, new errors in non-stem cells will be lost during normal crypt differentiation,
migration and death.

because non-stem cells and their errors are lost within
days from normal crypt cell differentiation and migration
[4,5]. Therefore, CpG rich sequences, like sequences used
to reconstruct species evolution [6], potentially function
as somatic epigenetic molecular clocks that can be used to
reconstruct somatic cell evolution. Preliminary studies are
consistent with this hypothesis because seemingly random human colon crypt methylation patterns appear to
record life-long stem cell fates within crypt niches [4].
Although crypt methylation patterns from multiple different aged colons are consistent with a clock-like accumulation of epigenetic errors, environmental factors may also
alter methylation. Age-related methylation levels differ
between individuals of the same age [1,2,4], which may
represent life-long biological differences between individuals, stochastic differences, or transient responses to environmental changes. It may be possible to distinguish
between these alternatives through serial examinations of
the same colon. A somatic molecular epigenetic clock predicts the amount of additional methylation is a function
of the time between examinations. In contrast, if methylation is more labile, patterns may quickly change after a
severe environmental insult. Here we sample methylation
62 days apart in the same colon before and after cytotoxic
neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation for a rectal
adenocarcinoma. Methylation patterns were essentially

unchanged, suggesting crypt stem cell epigenomes are relatively protected from transient environmental changes.

Case presentation
A 22 year-old male presented with anemia. Colonoscopy
revealed eight hyperplastic to adenomatous polyps ranging in size from 0.6 to 3.0 cm scattered through the colon,
and a four cm, locally invasive, ulcerative rectal adenocarcinoma five cm from the anus. The clinical impression
was attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP),
with a germline heterozygous truncating APC mutation at
codon 215 (CAG to TAG; Gln to stop). The first sample for
methylation analysis (Day 1) was a biopsy of normal
appearing sigmoid colon.
The patient received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of three, two week cycles of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil, with the last cycle ending two weeks before
colectomy. The patient exhibited Grade 3 toxicity with
mucositis, stomatitis, diarrhea, and parasthesia. He also
received radiation therapy to the pelvis (2,500 centigrays
over five days), ending 19 days before colectomy. The
specimens obtained for analysis were outside of the primary radiation field.
Colectomy revealed approximately 50 scattered small
hyperplastic to adenomatous polyps (0.1 to 0.3 cm), and

a 0.7 cm ulcerative lesion at the site of the rectal adenocarcinoma containing a few residual neoplastic glands with
superficial invasion of the muscularis propria. Lymph
nodes were negative for metastatic carcinoma. The second
specimen for analysis (Day 62) was taken from a normal
appearing region of the sigmoid colon.
Methylation analysis
Individual crypts were isolated from the first (a colonoscopic biopsy) and last (a 1–2 cm2 patch of mucosa) specimens using an EDTA-containing solution as previously
described [4]. DNA, extracted from individual crypts
placed in microfuge tubes, was bisulphite treated (to convert C's to U's, whereas methylated-C's are unchanged),
and amplified by PCR at two different CpG rich regions
called CSX (nine different crypts) and BGN (eight of the
same crypts). PCR products were cloned into bacterial vectors and eight clones representing individual PCR products were sequenced from each crypt [4].

Crypt patterns (5' to 3' order of methylation) before and
after neo-adjuvant therapy were complex and seemingly
random, consistent with stochastic epigenetic errors (Figure 2). The CSX (cardiac specific homeobox) sequence or
"tag" is autosomal (5q34, also called Mint23 [7]) and has
eight CpG sites located in the 3' untranslated region and
256 possible patterns ([2]8 possible 5' to 3' orders of
methylation). The BGN (biglycan) tag is on the X-chromosome (Xq28, one allele per male cell) and has nine
CpG sites located just distal to the promoter and 512
([2]9) possible patterns. These tags are not expressed in
the colon and therefore any methylation is unlikely to
confer selection [4]. Crypt methylation patterns are summarized by two statistics: percent methylation (proportion of methylated CpG sites) and diversity or numbers of
unique tags per eight sampled from each crypt.
Methylation tag values differed between crypts sampled
before and after neo-adjuvant therapy, but these differences were not significant and did not follow a trend (Figure 2). Average CSX tag values were lower and BGN tags
values were higher after neo-adjuvant therapy. A model
[4] in which random methylation errors start to accumulate from birth is consistent with the lack of significant tag
differences between serial specimens and the observed
crypt variations. The model can be simulated on a computer (using previously published human colon crypt
parameters [4]) to estimate average tag values and intervals that include 95% of simulated individual crypt outcomes (Figure 3). Different crypts within the same colon
may have different methylation patterns because errors
are stochastic and independent between cells and CpG
sites. Methylation patterns before and after neo-adjuvant
therapy are predicted to be similar because additional
errors acquired in the 62 days between the samples are rel-

atively insignificant compared to the 22 years since birth.
Observed crypt tag values were generally consistent with
the predictions of the model (Figure 3).
In addition to numbers of divisions since birth, methylation patterns (Figure 2) may also record stem cell dynamics. For example, crypt diversity or unique tags per crypt
appears to reflect crypt stem cell numbers [4]. This AFAP
patient appeared to have normal numbers of crypt stem
cells because his crypt diversity (3.22 and 2.33 average
unique CSX crypt tags) was consistent with a normal
colon (Figure 3). In contrast, significantly greater crypt
diversity has been observed in some familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients, with an average of 3.9
unique CSX tags per FAP crypt compared to 3.0 with nonFAP crypts, which translates to about 4-fold more FAP
crypt stem cells [8]. Greater numbers of crypt stem cells
correlate with germline APC mutations around the mutation cluster region (MCR) that remove some but not all βcatenin binding repeats [8]. Consistent with this observation, this patient had a truncating germline mutation
(Codon 215, CAG (Gln) to TAG (stop)) that removed all
β-catenin binding repeats.

Conclusion
The ability to extract historical information from normal
appearing tissue is limited. However, recent advances in
molecular phylogeny illustrate that genomes automatically record ancestry and time [6]. Although sequences are
usually faithfully copied, errors rarely occur, which are
also passed from generation to generation (Figure 1).
Sequence comparisons can be used to reconstruct species
evolution that occurred thousands to millions of years
ago. The greater the differences between sequences, the
greater the likely time since they shared a common
ancestor.
Sequences comparisons depend on relatively constant
error rates (a molecular clock hypothesis [6]) because
time is proportional to the number of sequence differences. Although it is possible that mutation rates vary over
time from environmental changes, species histories
inferred from sequences are generally consistent with relatively constant mutation rates over millions of years [6].
In theory, molecular phylogeny can also be applied to
somatic cell evolution because somatic cell genomes are
also passed from cell to cell. Although somatic cell
sequence comparisons are impractical because mutation
rates are low relative to human lifetimes, epigenetic errors
also potentially record ancestry because methylation
exhibits somatic inheritance [3]. Epigenetic replication
fidelity is less than sequence fidelity because age-related
methylation is readily detected in the human colon [1,2].
Colon crypt methylation patterns have been used to infer
normal human crypt niche dynamics [4], and that most

Crypt methylation before and neo-adjuvant therapy
Crypt methylation before and neo-adjuvant therapy. There are eight tags per crypt with each tag arranged in a 5' to 3' horizontal order of CpG sites. CSX (eight CpG sites) and BGN (nine CpG sites) tags were sampled from eight of the same crypts.
Crypt methylation patterns are summarized by percent methylation and numbers of unique tags per crypt. Methylation patterns were not significantly different before and after neo-adjuvant therapy, with averages summarize in the Table. The seemingly random methylation patterns are consistent with a model [4] in which stochastic methylation errors start to accumulate
from birth.

Figure 3
Crypt methylation tags are consistent with a clock-like stochastic accumulation of methylation errors from birth
Crypt methylation tags are consistent with a clock-like stochastic accumulation of methylation errors from birth. Such a model
using previously published crypt parameters [4] can be simulated on a computer to yield expected individual (dotted lines
include 95% of simulated crypt outcomes) and average (solid grey line) crypt values. Little difference is expected between the
initial (black X 's are individual crypt values and black triangles are average values) and final specimens (red bars are individual
crypt values and red circles are average values) because by this model, methylation errors slowly accumulate from birth, and
few additional changes are expected to accumulate during the 62 days between specimens.

directly adjacent adult crypts are not closely related
because their methylation patterns differ [9]. Stem cell
survival can also be inferred from methylation pattern
diversity (number of unique tags). For example, increased
crypt diversity and enhanced crypt stem cell survival is
observed in some FAP patients with truncating germline
mutations that remove some but not B-catenin binding
repeats [7]. In contrast and as with this patient, germline
APC mutations in the N-terminus of APC have not been
associated with enhanced stem cell survival [7], and are
associated with fewer polyps and AFAP [10].

A general problem with the use of sequences to reconstruct ancestry is the stochastic nature of most errors. It is
difficult to prove stochastic sequence errors actually accumulate in a clock-like manner, and error rates may
potentially fluctuate in response to environmental
changes. Highly variable error rates would obscure ancestral information because many errors may accumulate in
relatively short periods.
Although it is difficult to test a molecular clock hypothesis
for species evolution, it is possible to test a somatic

epigenetic molecular clock through serial examinations of
the same individual. This Case Report experimentally tests
the hypothesis that age-related methylation predominantly reflect stem cell errors that start to slowly accumulate from birth. Consistent with this hypothesis,
methylation patterns were not significantly different after
62 days despite intervening neo-adjuvant therapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy targets rapidly dividing cells and
normal colon is relatively unaffected, although diarrhea
(Grade 3 toxicity) may and did occur in this patient. However, the therapy did not appear to alter stem cell methylation patterns, suggesting stem cells are protected from
this type of therapy. Therefore, age-related methylation
appeared to be relatively stable and primarily a function
of the time or number of stem cell divisions since birth.
Further serial examinations with more patients and longer
intervals may provide additional evidence supporting or
refuting this hypothesis.

In summary, age-related methylation appears to slowly
accumulate in a clock-like manner in stem cells from
birth. The stochastic nature of somatic epigenetic errors
requires an algorithm for interpretation, which essentially
translates the sophisticated methods used to extract ancestry from species genomes to reconstruct somatic cell histories. The unseen fates of human crypt stem cells may be
potentially read from anyone because methylation automatically records their autobiographies.
