Abstract
Background: Chromosomal rearrangements, such as translocations and inversions, are recurrent
phenomena during evolution, and both of them are involved in reproductive isolation and
speciation. To better understand the molecular basis of chromosome rearrangements and their
part in karyotype evolution, we have investigated the history of human chromosome 17 by
comparative fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and sequence analysis.
Results: Human bacterial artificial chromosome/p1 artificial chromosome probes spanning the
length of chromosome 17 were used in FISH experiments on great apes, Old World monkeys and
New World monkeys to study the evolutionary history of this chromosome. We observed that
the macaque marker order represents the ancestral organization. Human, chimpanzee and gorilla
homologous chromosomes differ by a paracentric inversion that occurred specifically in the Homo
sapiens/Pan troglodytes/Gorilla gorilla ancestor. Detailed analyses of the paracentric inversion
revealed that the breakpoints mapped to two regions syntenic to human 17q12/21 and 17q23, both
rich in segmental duplications.
Conclusion: Sequence analyses of the human and macaque organization suggest that the
duplication events occurred in the catarrhine ancestor with the duplication blocks continuing to
duplicate or undergo gene conversion during evolution of the hominoid lineage. We propose that
the presence of these duplicons has mediated the inversion in the H. sapiens/P. troglodytes/G. gorilla
ancestor. Recently, the same duplication blocks have been shown to be polymorphic in the human
population and to be involved in triggering microdeletion and duplication in human. These results
further support a model where genomic architecture has a direct role in both rearrangement
involved in karyotype evolution and genomic instability in human.

Background

Karyotype evolution was first studied by classical cytogenetics based on comparison of banding pattern and, more
recently, using molecular cytogenetic tools such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Chromosome painting
and reciprocal chromosome painting, in particular, have
delineated the organization of the karyotype in the primate
ancestor [1,2] and in the mammalian ancestor [3-7]. Chromosome painting libraries alone cannot detect marker order
arrangement along chromosomes. In contrast, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones in FISH experiments, defining the marker order, can be used in phylogenetically related
species to reconstruct the evolutionary history of chromosomal rearrangements in extant primates [8,9]. FISH experiments are dependent upon the genetic distance between
species. Species-specific BAC clones can be helpful in this
regard. If sequence data are available, overgo probes (two 24mer oligonucleotides that share eight base pairs of complementary sequence at their 3' ends) or specific sequence
tagged sites (STSs) are designed in conserved regions of a reference species to recover orthologous clones by library
hybridization [10]. Such orthologous probes facilitate comparison between more distant species and the definition of
breakpoints. Molecular analysis of breakpoint regions can
provide insight into mechanisms involved in karyotype evolution [11,12].
Recently, a nearly complete sequence of human chromosome
17 was obtained as part of the Human Genome Project. The
chromosome sequence is interrupted by nine euchromatic
gaps and one gap corresponding to the centromere [13]. It is
one of the richest chromosomes in terms of G+C and gene
content. It is also significantly enriched in segmental duplications, ranking fourth in duplication density after chromosomes Y, 22 and 16 [13-19].
Many of the blocks of intrachromosomal segmental duplication on 17p have already been described as involved in DNA
rearrangements associated with several well-studied microdeletion disorders. These include hereditary neuropathy with
pressure palsies at 17p12, Smith-Magenis syndrome deletions
at 17p11.2 [20-22], and the microduplication at 17p12 in the
case of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A [23-26]. More
recently, segmental duplication blocks on the long arm of
chromosome 17 have been implicated in recurrent microdeletions associated with mental retardation [27-29], diabetes
and renal disease [30]; further data have demonstrated the
structural complexity of the region surrounding one multiple
sclerosis susceptibility locus on chromosome 17q22-24
[20,31]. The complex architecture in this region is also
responsible for susceptibility to one of the most common
somatic rearrangement events characterized, isodicentric
17q, which is associated with several cancers of poor prognosis [32].

In the present paper, we describe the evolutionary history of
human chromosome 17 in primates and a detailed study of
the evolution of segmental duplications in 17q12 and 17q23. A
total of 58 human BAC clones and 27 macaque specific BAC
clones were used in FISH experiments on great apes and on
representatives of Old World monkeys and New World monkeys in order to delineate the chromosome 17 phylogeny in
primates using the domestic cat and mouse genome
sequences as representative non-primate mammalian outgroups. We characterized the paracentric inversion breakpoints by FISH and detailed sequence analyses, which show a
clear association between inverson breakpoints and intrachromosomal segmental duplication blocks. The assignment
of the breakpoint region to clusters of segmental duplications
furthers the claim that genomic architecture is a significant
factor in hominoid karyotype evolution [33-36].

Results
Evolutionary history of human chromosome 17
Chromosome 17 evolution was studied, initially, by two-color
FISH of 12 single copy human BAC clones evenly distributed
along the chromosome (Table 1). The probes were hybridized
on metaphase chromosomal spreads of great ape species
(chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) and
orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus)), rhesus macaque (Macaca
mulatta) as a representative Old World monkey, and three
New World monkeys (marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), dusky
titi (Callicebus moloch) and woolly monkey (Lagothrix
lagothricha)). We performed a parallel analysis on Felix
catus to serve as a mammalian outgroup. We designed
'overgo' probes corresponding to conserved sequence within
each human BAC probe [10] and retrieved corresponding
large insert genomic clones by hybridization against a cat
genomic BAC library (RP-86). This approach facilitated comparative mapping by assembling a panel of cat probes orthologous to each of the human BAC loci (Additional data file 1).
The cat clones were used in FISH experiments on metaphase
spreads of F. catus and marker order was determined. In
addition, we also compared the organization of human chromosome 17 and the finished sequence of the mouse (Mus
musculus) orthologue (chromosome 11), the first finished
mouse chromosome [13], in an effort to identify the likely
mammalian ancestral state. If the centromere position is
excluded, then orangutan, rhesus macaque and the New
World monkeys share the same marker order. F. catus differs
from this form for an inversion between the markers A and B.
Zody et al. [13] have reported the same marker order arrangement on mouse chromosome 11.
The macaque organization, therefore, could be considered to
represent the ancestral hominoid organization, with a paracentric inversion of the long arm responsible for the current
human chromosome 17. During our FISH analysis, we narrowed the breakpoints of this rearrangement between FISH
marker probes E and F and between marker probes J and K

(Table 1 and Additional data file 2). Our analysis confirmed
the location of the pericentric inversion in chimpanzee and
chromosomal translocation in gorilla [11,37]. Moreover, we
found evidence of two centromere repositioning events
[38,39] in F. catus and L. lagotricha. Figure 1 schematically
summarizes our FISH results and the most parsimonious
chromosomal changes necessary to reconstruct chromosome
17 evolution in primates.

Breakpoint definition and analysis
The most basic approach to investigate the molecular mechanism underlying evolutionary chromosomal rearrangements
is to characterize the breakpoint regions at the molecular
level. We used two different approaches to define and analyze
the breakpoint regions of the paracentric inversion in 17q.
First, we further refined the proximal and distal breakpoints
using additional human BAC probes, between marker probes
E and F and between marker probes J and K. We tested 23
BACs against human and macaque in search of a clone that
produced a single signal on human chromosome 17 and a
double signal on both sides of the inverted segment in
macaque (termed a split signal). As a result, we were able to
localize the proximal breakpoint region (PBR) between the
BACs RP11-115K3 (E, chr17:33,140,726-33,322,352) and
RP11-923C2 (E1, chr17:33,713,298-33,818,972). Both the

BACs gave a single signal in 17q12 on human metaphases. In
contrast, in the macaque, E gave a single signal in a proximal
not inverted position while E1 gave a signal in a distal position
and it was thus included in the inverted segment (Figure 2a).
We refined the distal breakpoint region (DBR) between RP11465I18 (J1, chr17:57,474,072-57,660,715) and RP11-50G1
(J2, chr17:57,765,687-57,954,835). Probe J1 gave a signal on
17q23 in human, but it was mapped proximally in macaque,
while the BAC J2 produced a FISH signal in a distal location
in both human and macaque, thus suggesting it was external
to the inverted segment (Figure 2b). The most informative
probes are reported in Additional data file 2 and the overall
results are reported in Figure 1.
Complex duplication blocks mapping to the interval in E-E1
(390 kb chr17:33,322,352-33,713,298, named DUPA) and J1J2 (100 kb chr17:57,660,715-57,765,687, named DUPB) complicated precise definition of the inversion breakpoints using
this strategy. Four human BAC clones (Ea, Eb, Ec and Ed)
spanning DUPA were tested by FISH on human and
macaque. Each BAC gave duplicated signals on human chromosome 17 on both sides of the inverted segment. Notably,
they also showed duplicated signals in M. mulatta in the
proximal region except for the clone RP11-678G7 (Ed), which

Additional data file 2).
To further refine inversion breakpoints and duplication
organization, we used a panel of 27 macaque-specific clones
obtained from the macaque library by in silico [40] and
overgo-probes/STS library screenings. Overlapping clones
covering the PBR and DBR were assembled by end-sequence
similarity searches against the human genome (Additional
data file 3). All clones were tested by FISH.
One overgo probe, BP1/BP2 (chr17:33,612,761-33,612,796)
was designed from human sequence for the PBR. We
obtained only two positive clones mapping in the inverted
segment (green in Additional data file 3). Gaps in the assembled human sequence prevent the further design of more useful overgo probes. BAC clone CH250-269k7 (AC140608) was
mapped by BLAST sequence similarity searches, proximally
(located closer to the centromere) respect to the overgo probe
BP1/BP2. It produced the same hybridization pattern of the
human E clone (not inverted clone) on human 17q12 and on
the orthologous region in macaque. It is noteworthy that
other macaque BAC clones covering the PBR gave duplicated
signals both in proximal and distal regions on human chromosome 17 and proximally in macaque, thus preventing the
further refinement of the PBR by FISH (Figure 2c and Additional data file 3).
We designed two STSs to the DBR: 20g10-51l5
(chr17:57,729,109-57,729,131)
and
SHGC-78807
(chr17:57,826,604-57,826,825). Three positive clones were
obtained using 20g10-51l5 STS (blue in Additional data file 3)
and further tested by FISH. They produced signals on human
17q23 and proximally on macaque, internal to the inversion.
In addition, three BAC clones obtained by SHGC-78807
screening produced FISH signals distally both in human and
macaque, thus mapping external to the inversion (Additional
data file 3). BAC clone CH250-466D2 (only one end mapped
by BLAST against human to chr17:57,734,101-57,734,926
distal to the 20g10-51l5 STS) produced signals distally in both
human and macaque.

Combined, our approaches allowed us to further refine the
PBR to an approximately 290 kb region between human BAC
clone E, RP11-115K3 (33,322,352) and the overgo probes
BP1/BP2 (33,612,761) and the DBR to an approximately 5 kb
region between STS 20g10-51l5 (57,729,131) and the macaque
BAC CH250-466D2 (57,734,101).

Organization and evolution of segmental duplications
We performed a series of bioinformatics and comparative
FISH analyses to provide further insight into the evolutionary
history of the duplication blocks mapping to the PBR and
DBR. Human duplication blocks are typically organized as
mosaic structures composed of duplications of diverse evolutionary origin [41]. We first considered the evolutionary
architecture of each of the regions based on a recently developed algorithm designed to delineate the most likely ancestral duplication events (duplicons) within each block (Figure
3). In silico analysis was performed in the regions flanking the
PBR and DBR and two more duplication clusters: DUPA'
(chr17:42,332,487-42,612,217)
and
DUPB'
(chr17:55,074,551-55,498,114) mapping between proximal
and DBRs. Each duplicated block, DUPA, DUPA', DUPB' and
DUPB showed a very complex organization, having unique
and shared duplicon modules. The most common duplicon

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R28

Cardone et al. R28.6

corresponded to the rapidly evolving TBC1D3 gene family,
which mapped multiple times to DUPA, DUPB and DUPB'.
We found four copies in DUPA, one in DUPB' and two entire
copies of the gene in DUPB. Interestingly, by comparing the
different copies of this gene both inside each block of
duplication and between the two clusters, we found that the
sequence similarity was higher inside each cluster (approximately 90%) than between DUPA and DUPB (87-88%). In
addition, sequence analyses showed copies of the same gene,
or part of it, also in 17p11/12 with a lower sequence similarity
(85-86%). Similar analyses were performed on the Rhesus
genome in the UCSC browser. We found five copies of the
TBC1D3 gene mapping in the region orthologous to 17q12,
where the PBR was previously defined, but no homologous
region was detected in the orthologous region of 17q23.
To estimate the age of each duplicon within DUPA and DUPB,
we analyzed the sequence identity between derived duplicons
mapping within each duplication block and the presumptive
ancestral loci. Within DUPA, we found that most of the duplicons showed 85-99% (mean 90.83%) sequence identity to
their ancestral loci (Figure 4a), while in DUPB a shorter range
of sequence identity was observed (range 87-99%; mean
95.0%; Figure 4b). Assuming a relative neutral molecular

Duplication architecture in 17q21-23. Structure of duplication regions: large (≥10 kb), high identity (≥95%) segmental duplications are shown between
DUPA, DUPA', DUPB and DUPB' (green-striped blocks in the first row) as pairwise alignments (blue lines). Underlying duplicon mosaic structure (second
bottom row) was defined using the program DupMasker [56]. The different colors represent the different cytoband locations for the ancestral loci of
duplications (see the color key code below; NA, ancestral locus not determined) [56]. DUPA-DUPB' share fewer high-identity duplications compared to
DUPA-DUPB (total aligned = 104.7 kb, average identity = 97.4%; Additional data file 6). The PBR and DBR are shown as red-striped blocks (third row).
The proximal and distal breakpoint regions found in microdeletion cases (PBR' and DRB', fourth row), according to Mefford et al. [30], are shown as
orange-striped blocks.

In order to further define the organization and the evolutionary history of duplication blocks, we performed a series of
comparative FISH experiments on great ape, Old World monkey and New World monkey metaphase and interphase chromosomes using human BAC clones corresponding to the
duplication blocks (Additional data file 2). Complex hybridization patterns were observed in chimpanzee and gorilla,
while the orangutan showed a pattern similar to macaque.
The exact order and localization of signals were defined by
FISH on interphase and stretched chromosomes. The overall
results are reported in Additional data file 4. Comparative
FISH analysis using the BAC clones covering DUPA' showed
duplicated signals on human chromosome 17q, but not on
macaque. BAC clone RP11-178C3, spanning DUPB', gave
duplicated signals also on macaque in the region orthologous
to 17q12 (Additional data files 2, 4 and 5).
In the New World monkey, only the BAC RP11-678G7 (Ed)
mapping in DUPA gave double signals in the proximal and
distal region (orange in Additional data file 4). In order to
understand if the cross-hybridization signal was due to an
existing duplication or a splitting signal, BAC clones flanking
clones to Ed were tested. Proximal human BAC RP11-493E8
(Ec) produced signals corresponding to the orthologous
17q12 region external to the inversion. The distal BAC, RP11923C2 (E1), gave a signal in an orthologous region to 17q23,
mapping internal to the inversion. FISH experiments using
BAC clones covering DUPA', DUPB' and DUPB did not detect
any duplication in New World monkeys. Finally, overgo
probes mapping in the duplicated regions were used to screen
a cat genome BAC library for evidence of segmental duplications. No evidence of duplications was found. Zody et al. [13]
have suggested a lower rate of duplication in mouse chromosome 11 orthologous to human chromosome 17, while a burst
of segmental duplications in the primate lineage on chromosome 17 has been reported by She et al. [19] and Bailey et al.
[14,41].

clock of evolution and the average degree of sequence identity
between macaque and human (94.5%) [42], these data suggest that duplicative transposition events began to form these
regions prior to the separation of human and macaque lineages in a common catarrhine ancestor. Our data further suggest that DUPA may be more ancient, composed of duplicons
that show greater divergence with respect to ancestral loci
when compared to DUPB. Surprisingly, an analysis of pairwise alignments between DUPA and DUPB show many segments with a high degree of sequence identity (97-99%),
perhaps as a result of gene conversion or recurrent reciprocal
duplication events (Figure 4c). We note, however, that these
high-identity alignments between DUPA and DUPB are significantly shorter when compared to ancestral-derivative
duplication events. We found no evidence of segmental duplication between DUPA' and DUPA or between DUPB' and
DUPB.

Discussion

In the present paper, we report the evolutionary history of
human chromosome 17, as well as a detailed evolutionary
study of the cluster duplications in 17q12 and q23. By using
probes distributed along chromosome 17 we have determined
the detailed marker order in seven primate species using the
cat genome as a representative mammalian outgroup. In all

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R28

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/2/R28

examined species, including mouse [13], the chromosome
homologous to human chromosome 17 was a single syntenic
group or a contiguous part of a larger chromosome. The
chromosome organization found in cat differed from this
organization by a single inversion between markers A and B,
also reported in mouse by Zody et al. [13]. We suggest that
this form may be assumed as ancestral to mammals (MA in
Figure 1). The inversion between markers A and B was not
found in any of the analyzed primate species, suggesting that
the macaque organization represents the ancestral primate
configuration (PA in Figure 1). Moreover, the present study
revealed that a paracentric inversion occurred in the ancestor
of H. sapiens/P. troglodytes/G. gorilla after divergence of
the orangutan (P. pygmaeus). Other species-specific rearrangements were found in the chimpanzee and gorilla lineage, as already described by Kehrer-Sawatzki et al. [11] and
Stankiewicz et al. [37], respectively (Figure 1).
The paracentric inversion breakpoint regions were accurately
defined and analyzed. Using molecular cytogenetics and bioinformatics approaches, we mapped the proximal breakpoint
to a 290 kb region and the distal breakpoint to an approximately 5 kb region. Precise definition was prevented due to
the presence of highly duplicated sequences in these regions.
Our analysis showed that both the PBR and DBR localize
inside large duplication blocks, named DUPA (approximately
390 kb) and DUPB (approximately 100 kb) in 17q12 and
17q23, respectively.
Sequence and FISH analysis detected four duplication blocks
in the human inverted region, named DUPA, DUPA', DUPB'
and DUPB, showing high sequence similarity, with the
exception of DUPA'. We found DUPA' duplicated only in
human and gorilla, thus suggesting this duplication occurred
in the H. sapiens/P. troglodytes/G. gorilla ancestor, but was
deleted in the P. troglodytes lineage.
Interestingly, our results demonstrated that the PBR, mapping in DUPA, is duplicated also in macaque, while no duplications were found in the distal region of the macaque
homologous chromosome. These findings are also consistent
with the presence of ancestral pairwise alignments of greater
sequence divergence (mean = 90%; Figure 4a). No duplications were found in New World monkeys. This strongly suggests that DUPA may be considered the original cluster and
the first event of duplication that occurred in the macaque
ancestor about 25 million years ago. A subsequent duplication event, mediated by duplicative transposition, may have
occurred in the great ape ancestor, thus creating paralogous
duplication blocks as revealed by the presence of both DUPA
and DUPB in all the analyzed hominoids. As reported by
Stankiewicz et al. [37] in gorilla and Sawatzki et al. [11] in
chimpanzee, paralogous sequences can trigger inversions by
non-allelic homologous recombination. As well, we hypothesize that DUPA and DUPB, as paralogous duplication blocks
in 17q12-17q23, triggered the paracentric inversion in the H.

sapiens/P. troglodytes/G. gorilla ancestor after the divergence of orangutan (12 million years ago) by non-allelic
homologous recombination. However, sequence comparison
demonstrated that the similarity is higher between DUPA and
DUPB compared to ancestral duplication loci, thus demonstrating that some duplication events or gene conversion
events occurred more recently during hominoid evolution.
Moreover, our data show DUPA, DUPB' and DUPB presumably derived from an ancestral sequence that was subjected to
multiple events of duplication during primate evolution. In
this regard, this supports the non-random distribution of the
segmental duplication within regions of a chromosome, thus
defining precisely 17q12 and 17q23 as duplication hubs or
acceptor regions [41].
Additional further events of gene conversion and duplication
could explain the hybridization pattern of great ape 17p, suggesting that extensive duplications occurred after the rearrangements in H. sapiens, P. troglodytes and G. gorilla.
Sequence comparison between the 17q clusters and 17p duplicons suggests that the copies on the p arm originated via more
recent duplication events, as suggested by Bailey et al. [41].
The cluster of duplications in 17q22-24 has previously been
described as being associated with a multiple sclerosis
susceptibility locus [20,31]. More recently, segmental duplications in 17q12 have been described as involved in the genesis of microdeletion associated with pediatric renal disease
and epilepsy and fetal renal dysplasia. Detailed analysis of
seven affected individuals with microdeletion [30] show distal breakpoints clustering in a region corresponding to the
DUPA described in the present paper (Figure 3). Further,
these segmental duplications are polymorphic in copy
number and structure among unaffected individuals, thus
showing high variability in the human population [30].
Recent data reported segmental duplications as predisposing
elements in genomic disorders associated with chromosomal
rearrangements [43-45]. Several cases have been reported
where segmental duplications triggered chromosomal rearrangements during evolution and in the human population
[34,46]. Other examples show that our findings may be applicable to a broad range of taxa. The evolutionary chromosome
translocation 4;19 breakpoints in G. gorilla, for instance,
have been associated with the Charcot-Marie-Tooth microduplication syndrome [37]. Furthermore, in humans segmental
duplications correspond to the location of a latent evolutionary centromere [38,39]. This 'centromere' can be reactivated
to a functional centromere when a chromosomal rearrangement carries an acentric fragment and a small marker chromosome is recovered. It is unknown if segmental duplications
can trigger this reactivation, but clearly they cluster around
regions of neocentromere formation and breakpoint regions
[38,39]. All of these data further support the link between

duplications and chromosomal rearrangements involved in
both genome evolution and genomic disorders.

Conclusion

The present study has tracked the evolution of human chromosome 17, showing specific paracentric inversion in the H.
sapiens/P. troglodytes/G. gorilla ancestor. The molecular
characterizaton of the inversion breakpoints pointed out the
role of segmental duplication in evolutionary rearrangements. Furthermore, the results defined important aspects of,
and the relationship between, the role of segmental duplications in evolution and human genomic instability.
In summary, our molecular and computational analysis has
revealed that genome architecture has evolved in a complex
manner involving serial segmental duplications and gene
conversion events that triggered evolutionary inversions.
These regions are involved in human genomic instability, further supporting the role of segmental duplication in both evolution and human diseases.

Materials and methods
Cell lines
Metaphase preparations were obtained from cell lines (lymphoblasts or fibroblasts) from the following species. Great
apes: common chimpanzee (P. troglodytes), gorilla (G.
gorilla), and Borneo orangutan (P. pygmaeus pygmaeus).
Old World monkeys: rhesus macaque (M. mulatta, Cercopithecinae). New World monkeys: wooly monkey (L.
lagothricha, Atelinae), common marmoset (C. jacchus,
Callitrichinae), and dusky titi (C. moloch, Callicebinae); and
cat (F. catus).

FISH experiments
DNA extraction from BACs was previously reported [38].
FISH experiments were performed essentially as described by
Lichter et al. [47]. Digital images were obtained using a Leica
DMRXA2 epifluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled
CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Trenton, NJ, USA).
Cy3-dCTP, FluorX-dCTP, DEAC, Cy5-dCTP and DAPI
fluorescence signals, detected with specific filters, were
recorded separately as gray scale images. Pseudocoloring and
merging of images were performed using Adobe Photoshop™
software.

Library screening
STSs (Additional data file 1) used for CH250 high density filter library-screening were chosen from the University of California Santa Cruz database (UCSC; May 2004 release) [48].
Library screenings, using the human PCR products, were carried out according to a published protocol from Pieter De
Jong [49]. The first segment of the CH250 macaque genomic
library is 6.0× redundant [50]. The identification of addi-

tional BAC clones specific for rhesus macaque took advantage
of specific genome browsers [40,48].
Fifteen overgo probes of 36-40 bp each were designed based
on conserved sequences between the human and mouse
genomes according to the HomoloGene database [51], using a
previously described protocol [52]. The probes were hybridized to high-density filters of F. catus BAC libraries (RPCI-86;
see Results) and the images were analyzed with ArrayVision
Ver6.0 (Imaging Research Inc., Linton, UK). The sequence
and location of overgo probes, along with clones they identified, are reported in Additional data file 2. Some overgo
probes were also used to screen the rhesus macaque library
(CHORI-250) to investigate the breakpoint regions (see
Results).
Marker order reconstruction took advantage of the GRIMM
software package, designed to outline the most parsimonious
scenario of evolutionary marker order changes [53,54].

Sequence and segmental duplication analyses
In order to show the sequence homology between the putative
breakpoints, we analyzed segmental duplication pairwise
alignments (size ≥10 kb and sequence identity ≥95%; build35
UCSC human genome Browser) defined by the whole genome
assembly comparison method [55]. The ancestral origin of
the duplications was determined as described [56]. The duplicons were color-coded based on the cytogenetic band location
of their ancestral loci. The age of the duplications at each
breakpoint was also estimated by calculating sequence identity between predicted ancestral and derived duplications.
