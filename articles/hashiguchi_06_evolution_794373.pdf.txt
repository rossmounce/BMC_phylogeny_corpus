Abstract
Background: In teleost fishes that lack a vomeronasal organ, both main odorant receptors (ORs)
and vomeronasal receptors family 2 (V2Rs) are expressed in the olfactory epithelium, and used for
perception of water-soluble chemicals. In zebrafish, it is known that both ORs and V2Rs formed
multigene families of about a hundred copies. Whereas the contribution of V2Rs in zebrafish to
olfaction has been found to be substantially large, the composition and structure of the V2R gene
family in other fishes are poorly known, compared with the OR gene family.
Results: To understand the evolutionary dynamics of V2R genes in fishes, V2R sequences in
zebrafish, medaka, fugu, and spotted green pufferfish were identified from their draft genome
sequences. There were remarkable differences in the number of intact V2R genes in different
species. Most V2R genes in these fishes were tightly clustered in one or two specific chromosomal
regions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the fish V2R family could be subdivided into 16
subfamilies that had diverged before the separation of the four fishes. Genes in two subfamilies in
zebrafish and another subfamily in medaka increased in their number independently, suggesting
species-specific evolution in olfaction. Interestingly, the arrangements of V2R genes in the gene
clusters were highly conserved among species in the subfamily level. A genomic region of tetrapods
corresponding to the region in fishes that contains the V2R cluster was found to have no V2R gene
in any species.
Conclusion: Our results have indicated that the evolutionary dynamics of fish V2Rs are
characterized by rapid gene turnover and lineage-specific phylogenetic clustering. In addition, the
present phylogenetic and comparative genome analyses have shown that the fish V2Rs have
expanded after the divergence between teleost and tetrapod lineages. The present identification of
the entire V2R repertoire in fishes would provide useful foundation to the future functional and
evolutionary studies of fish V2R gene family.

Background
Olfaction is a sense for recognizing environmental chemicals. In many animals, olfaction plays crucial roles in various activities, such as foraging, migration, and mating. In
vertebrates, odor chemicals are perceived by three evolu-

tionary distinct groups of seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Genes encoding the
main odorant receptors (ORs) form the largest multigene
family in vertebrates. For example, over 1,000 distinct OR
copies have been identified in the mouse genome [1,2]. In

addition to ORs, vertebrates have two distinct families of
GPCRs for chemical receptors, called vomeronasal receptors family 1 (V1Rs) and family 2 (V2Rs). In mammals,
these receptors are mainly expressed in the vomeronasal
organ [3-6], and are considered to be used for detecting
pheromones. The V1R gene repertoire has been described
in several mammalian species, the numbers of intact
genes varying from a few to over 150 [7,8] among species.
The repertoire of V2R genes has been described in mice
and rats [9]. The number of intact V2R genes is counted 61
in mice and 57 in rats [9].
In teleost fishes that lack a vomeronasal organ, on the
other hand, both main odorant and vomeronasal receptors are expressed in the olfactory epithelium [10-12].
Recent database studies have revealed that fish ORs and
V2Rs form multigene families with a hundred copies,
respectively [13-15]. In addition, one V1R homolog has
also been found in several fishes, and its expression confirmed in the olfactory epithelium [12].

V2Rs may provide some insights into the mechanisms of
sexual selection and speciation in fishes.
The purpose of this study is to understand the evolutionary dynamics of the fish V2R gene family. For this purpose, we identified V2R sequences in zebrafish Danio rerio,
medaka Oryzias latipes, fugu Takifugu rubripes, and spotted
green pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis from their draft
genome sequences by using several computational methods. Recent advances in the molecular phylogenetic study
of fishes have enabled us to infer the evolutionary process
of fish V2Rs with relatively reliable divergence time estimation (Figure 1) [27]. In this study, the comparison and
phylogenetic analysis of V2R repertoires in these fishes
implied the organization and evolution of the fish V2R
gene family. In addition, a possible evolutionary origin of
the fish V2R family was inferred by comparing the
genomic regions in fishes containing V2R genes with the
homologous regions in some tetrapod species.

Results
In the previous study, we identified 88 V2R genes and
pseudogenes in the zebrafish genome [15]. This number
is not small compared with the number of OR sequences
in this species (133 copies) [13]. Thus, in zebrafish, the
contribution of V2R to olfaction seems substantially large.
The repertoire of V2R genes in each fish is considered to
reflect the ability of olfaction in fish species, given that different V2Rs bind to different sets of odor chemicals. The
repertoire of V2R genes in fishes, however, is almost
unknown except in zebrafish [15] and fugu [16,17].
It has been indicated that fish V2Rs recognize mainly
amino acids [18-20]. Consequently, they are considered
to be receptors for naturally occurring odors, not pheromones, because, in fishes, amino acids are common odorant substances found in natural waters [21]. However,
recent studies on mammals have indicated that some
V2Rs recognize peptides released by individuals and are
used for chemical communication. For example, a peptide
pheromone secreted from the extraorbital lacrimal gland
of male mice (the peptide pheromone was contained in
the tears of male mice) was suggested to be recognized by
V2Rs [22]. V2Rs may also be used as receptors for small
peptides that serve as ligands for major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) molecules [23]. MHC-based sexual selection is also known to involve olfactory mechanisms in
fishes [24,25]. For instance, female three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus has been suggested to assess the
degree of MHC diversity of their potential partners by
sensing peptides for MHC ligands [26]. V2Rs in fish are
possibly also involved in chemical communication by
small peptides like MHC ligands as in mammals. Therefore, understanding the evolutionary dynamics of fish

Repertoires of V2R genes in zebrafish, medaka, fugu, and
pufferfish
In order to characterize V2R genes in teleost fishes, we
searched zebrafish, medaka, fugu, and pufferfish genomic
sequences using the trans-membrane (TM) domain of several representative fish V2Rs known in fugu [16], goldfish
[10], and zebrafish [15] as queries. In this study, we identified V2R genes by combining a low-threshold TBLASTN
search with profile hidden Markov model- (HMM) based
gene prediction. The identification procedure of V2R
genes/pseudogenes is shown as a flow chart in Figure 2.
Putative fish V2R sequences obtained by this search were
classified into two classes, putatively functional genes and
nonfunctional pseudogenes. In this study, a gene was considered putatively functional if it had a complete coding
sequence with up to two disruptions. If a gene had more
than two disruptions or lacked the regions from TM1 to
TM7, it was considered as a pseudogene. We confirmed
the exon/intron junctions by looking at the alignments of
predicted V2R sequences, because V2R genes contain multiple exons. Almost all exon/intron boundaries in our predicted genes were demarcated by standard GT/AG splice
sites. We identified several V2R sequences with the complete TM regions but with short N-terminal region. Particularly in fugu and medaka, these sequences were found
mainly in the scaffolds less than 3 kb. These short
sequences appear to be attributed to incomplete genomic
data in these fishes. In the present study, V2R sequences
less than 2,400 bp were considered to be "partial
sequences", and were not used in the phylogenetic analysis to avoid the loss of information. These partial
sequences are indicated in Supplementary tables [see
Additional files 3, 4, 5, 6]. These partial sequences were

also counted as putatively functional genes unless they
have more than three disruptions.
As a result of the database search and gene prediction, we
identified 57, 39, 38, and 23 V2R sequences in zebrafish,
medaka, fugu, and pufferfish genomes, respectively. In
these V2R sequences, 46 zebrafish, 22 medaka, 30 fugu,
and 12 pufferfish genes were considered to be putatively
functional. The proportion of putatively functional members in the V2R sequences in zebrafish (82%) and fugu
(78%) were higher than in medaka (56%) and pufferfish
(52%). However, these percentages may not be reliable
because some of the V2R partial sequences may be attributed to the redundancy of the draft genome sequences.
Indeed, several putative V2R partial sequences identified
in the previous version of the zebrafish genome assembly
(Zv. 4) [15] turned out to be redundant in the latest version of the genome assembly (Zv. 5) examined in this
study.
Phylogenetic relationships of fish V2R genes
Figure 3 shows a neighbor-joining (NJ) tree for 92 putatively functional fish V2Rs and several related GPCRs in
vertebrates. The phylogenetic tree indicated that the divergences of V2Rs (family A+B) [9], Ca2+-sensing receptors
(CaSRs), GPRC6A (fish 5.24 receptors and their putative
orthologs in mammals [28-30]), and family C V2R

(V2R2) receptors [9] predated the separation of tetrapods
and teleosts (solid circles in Figure 3). In the NJ tree, the
monophyly of each of these families was supported with
high bootstrap probability. This result was also supported
by maximum parsimony (MP) trees reconstructed by several representative V2R and related GPCR genes [see Additional file 1], although in maximum likelihood (ML)
analysis, the monophyly of V2R (family A+B) was not
supported [see Additional file 2]. However, this discrepancy may be attributed to the reduction of phylogenetic
information of the dataset (In MP and ML analyses, only
57 OTUs were used out of 134 OTUs in full dataset). In NJ
tree reconstructed by using full dataset, indeed, the monophyly of V2R (family A+B) was supported with a high
boostrap probability (87%). All four fishes examined in
this study had one CaSR, one GPRC6A, and one family C
V2R, although for CaSR in medaka and GPRC6A in pufferfish, only partial sequences were found in their draft
genome sequences [see Additional files 4 and 6]. In this
article, we consider two V2R families, family A+B and
family C V2Rs defined by Yang and colleagues [9], as distinct GPCR groups that diverged before the separation of
teleosts and tetrapods (Figure 3). In the following, the
term "V2R" is used simply to mean V2Rs family of the
A+B.

80% amino acid identity. As a result, all V2R pseudogenes
identified in this study could be assigned to one of the 16
subfamilies defined by phylogenetic analysis.
Table 1 shows the numbers of putatively functional genes
and pseudogenes belonging to each V2R gene subfamily
in the four fishes. The distribution of V2R genes in the 16
subfamilies substantially differed among species.
Zebrafish has many genes belonging to subfamilies 9 and
16 (14 and 19 genes, respectively). Medaka has a relatively
larger number of genes in subfamily 4 (7 genes and 7
pseudogenes). Fugu has a larger number of genes in subfamily 16 (7 genes and 1 pseudogenes), although some of
these genes may be redundant because four out of seven
genes are partial sequences [see 5]. Pufferfish have only up
to three putatively functional genes in any subfamilies.
Nine subfamilies (2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, and 16) were
common in all fishes, when pseudogenes were taken into
account (Table 1). Genes in subfamilies 1, 5, and 11 were
zebrafish specific, and were not found in medaka, fugu,
and pufferfish. In contrast, genes in subfamilies 6 and 15
were not found in zebrafish.

Figure 3 also indicated that all fish V2Rs formed a monophyletic clade with high bootstrap probability (96%). We
defined "subfamily" within the fish V2R family on the
basis of phylogenetic grouping into clades that diverged
before the divergence between the lineages of zebrafish
and other fishes. Within the fish V2R family, 11 subfamilies could simply be recognized (2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10,
12, 13, 14, and 16; open circles in Figure 3). In addition,
five monophyletic clades specific to zebrafish, or two or
three of other fishes were found (1, 5, 6, 11, and 15).
These clades also seem to have originated before the divergence of the lineages of zebrafish and other fishes, because
the divergences of these clades predated those of adjacent
subfamilies (Figure 3). Consequently, 16 virtually equivalent subfamilies could be identified within the fish V2R
clade (Figure 3) and any intact fish V2Rs were included in
one of these subfamilies. Almost all of these subfamilies
could also be identified in the MP and ML trees [see Additional files 1 and 2].
In addition, to determine the gene subfamily to which
each of "V2R pseudogenes" and "partial sequences"
belongs, a BLASTP search was conducted against putatively functional fish V2R amino acid sequences by using
the translated pseudogene sequences of fish V2Rs as a
query. Query sequences were assigned to the subfamily to
which the best hit of the query belonged with more than

Genomic distributions of V2R genes in zebrafish, medaka,
fugu, and pufferfish
Physical maps of V2R gene clusters in the four fishes are
shown in Figure 4. Most zebrafish V2R genes were located
on three different chromosomes, 5, 17, and 18. On chromosome 5, two putatively functional V2R genes were
found at ca. 1 Mb intervals, with the same transcriptional
orientation (not shown in Figure 4). Both of these genes
belonged to subfamily 16. On chromosome 17, nine V2R
genes and pseudogenes were encoded within a 400 kb
region. All genes shared the same transcriptional orientation. The largest V2R gene cluster was found on chromosome 18. Thirty-four zebrafish V2R genes/pseudogenes
and one family C V2R gene were located within a 4 Mb
region on chromosome 18. Twenty-nine genes and pseudogenes in this region were concentrated within a 1 Mb
region (Figure 4). On the other hand, in medaka and pufferfish, most of their V2R genes and pseudogenes found in
this study were encoded in one chromosomal region. In
medaka, 25 V2R genes and pseudogenes were clustered
within a 300 kb region of scaffold 10 of its draft genome
sequences. Surprisingly, in pufferfish, 22 V2R genes and
pseudogenes were clustered within only a 100 kb region
of chromosome 16. Similarly, in fugu, most of the V2R
sequences may also be encoded in a single gene cluster
with high density, although they were separated into several different scaffolds. A fugu V2R gene cluster was reconstructed by referring to that of pufferfish (Figure 4), but
the true relationship across the scaffolds has not been
known so far. In fugu, only four representative scaffolds
containing V2R genes are shown. In all fishes examined,
genes in the same subfamily tended to be located close to

one another (e.g. subfamilies 4 and 16), suggesting tandem gene duplication as the primary mechanism for
expansion of the gene family.
Comparison of the gene clusters among four fishes
revealed similarities in the arrangements of fish V2R genes
in the gene subfamily level (Figure 4). First, the arrangement of V2R genes in the middle of the cluster begins with
subfamilies 2, 14, 4, and end with subfamily 16, in all
four fishes. Second, the position and orientation of one
subfamily 12 gene also seems common to all species. Such
concordance is likely to reflect the gene order of the V2R
cluster in the common ancestor of the four fishes.
Comparison of the genomic region containing V2R gene
cluster in fish with corresponding regions in tetrapods
To find the tetrapod genomic region corresponding to the
fish region that contains the V2R gene cluster, putative
orthologs of several genes that are commonly located
proximal to fish V2R gene clusters were identified in tetrapod genomic sequences (Figure 5). Initially, we characterized neprilysin, phospholipase C-η2 (PLC-η2), acetyl
coenzyme A transporter 1 (SLC33A1), and GMP syntase
(GMPS) homologs in fish genomes, near the fish V2R
gene cluster. The V2R clusters in pufferfish and medaka
were located between neprilysin and PLC-η2 (Figure 5). In
zebrafish, PLC-η2 was found near the V2R gene cluster in
chromosome 18, but the neprilysin homolog was not
found. On the other hand, SLC33A1 and GMPS were

identified near the family C V2R gene on zebrafish chromosome 18, but not in medaka scaffold 10 and pufferfish
chromosome 16. Subsequently, putative orthologs of
these four genes were identified in the tropical clawed frog
(Xenopus tropicalis), chicken (Gallus gallus), mouse (Mus
musculus), and human (Homo sapiens) genomes. All four
genes (neprilysin, PLC-η2, SLC33A1, and GMPS) were tandem linked on specific chromosomal regions in all tetrapod species examined (Figure 5). The relative positions
and orientations of these genes in fishes were well consistent with those in tetrapods, indicating that the synteny of
the genomic region is highly conserved between teleosts
and tetrapods. However, the V2R gene cluster located
between neprilysin and PLC-η2 genes in fishes was not
found in any tetrapods. On the other hand, one or more
family C V2R genes near SLC33A1 and GMPS genes were
observed commonly in zebrafish, frog, mouse, and
human genomes, although not in the chicken genome.

Discussion
Large variation of V2R gene repertoire among fish species
In this study, we identified the V2R gene repertoire in
fishes by searching zebrafish, medaka, fugu, and pufferfish draft genome sequences. Our results provide the first
global outline of the fish V2R gene repertoire. In this
study, we showed that the numbers of functional V2Rs
varied substantially among fishes. We identified 46 putatively functional V2R genes in zebrafish, that were much
more than in other fishes (22 medaka; 30 fugu; 12 puffer-

fish). The larger number of V2R genes in zebrafish is
mainly attributed to species-specific gene duplication
events in subfamilies 9 and 16 (Figure 3). Table 2 shows
the numbers of putatively functional chemical receptor
genes identified in the four fishes. The size of the putatively functional V2R repertoire varies by 3.8-fold among
the four fishes. This size variation of fish V2R is larger than

that of OR (2.4-fold, Table 2). In addition, the numbers of
fish V1R and taste receptors (taste 1 and 2 receptors) are
almost the same in all fishes (Table 2); fish V1R gene, in
particular, is a single copy in all fishes examined [12].
Thus, the V2R family is considered to be the most variable
chemical receptor gene family in fishes. Such a high variation in sizes of the V2R gene family is also observed in

mammals. Sixty one and 57 functional V2R genes have
been identified in the mouse and rat, respectively [9],
whereas no functional V2R gene has been found in
human and other primates [34].
Recently, the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR) family has been shown to be used as odorant receptors in
mice [35]. Homologs of TAAR genes are also found in

fishes [33], and some of them are suggested to be
expressed in the olfactory epithelium in zebrafish [35].
Therefore, also in fishes, TAAR family is likely to be used
for perception of odor chemicals. Interestingly, the size of
the functional TAAR repertoire varies by 7.1-fold between
zebrafish and fugu (Table 2). It is possible that the differences of V2R and TAAR gene repertoires mainly cause the
difference of odor sensitivity among fish species.

Evolution of the fish V2R gene family
Phylogenetic analysis of V2Rs and several "V2R-related"
GPCRs (family 3 GPCRs) [36] revealed that the four
GPCR families, GPRC6As, CaSR, family C V2R, and V2Rs
(family A+B), were separated before the divergence of teleost fish and tetrapods (Figure 3). In fishes, GPRC6As and
CaSRs appear to be functionally distinct from V2Rs (family A+B) because their expression profiles seem different
from the fish family A+B V2R genes. It is known that in
fish, CaSR is expressed mainly in the kidneys and functions as a salinity sensor [37,38]. In goldfish, 5.24 receptor (GPRC6A ortholog) is expressed in olfactory cells,
responding to naturally occurring amino acids [28,29].
However, goldfish 5.24 receptor is expressed not only in
the olfactory epithelium, but also in the gills, tongue, and
other tissues [28]. In human, GPRC6A is reported to be
widely expressed in the brain and peripheral tissues with
highest levels in the kidney, skeletal muscle, testis, and
leucocytes [30]. Additionally, GPRC6A and CaSR were
single copy genes in the four fishes. This also suggest that
these receptors are not involved in the distinction of the
diverse array of odor chemicals. Fish family C V2R is also
a single copy gene in all four fishes (Table 1), and thus,
may be functionally distinct from other fish V2Rs (family
A+B); however, the expression of the fish family C V2R is
not yet known and further studies are needed.

The present phylogenetic analysis also indicated that fish
V2Rs were further subdivided into at least 16 subfamilies
that diverged before the divergence between the lineages
of zebrafish and three other fishes (Figure 3). The number
of V2R genes in each subfamily was remarkably different
among species as discussed above. Generally, the evolution of vertebrate odorant and vomeronasal receptors is
characterized by rapid gene turnover and lineage-specific
phylogenetic clustering [8,9,13,39]. These characteristics
are also observed in fish V2Rs. Indeed, the phylogenetic
tree shows that fish V2R genes tend to form species-spe-

cific gene clades (e.g. zebrafish subfamilies 9 and 16,
medaka subfamily 4; Figures 3 and 4). These V2R subfamilies unique to each species may be related to the
adaptation to species-specific environmental odor and/or
pheromonal signals. On the other hand, almost one-toone orthologous relationships were found among the four
fishes in four subfamilies, 2, 7, 10, and 12 (Figure 3).
These V2Rs may be used to perceive common odor substances to these fishes, like amino and nucleic acids [21].
In fishes, most V2R genes were located on one specific
genomic region as a gene cluster (Figure 4). Interestingly,
the arrangements of V2R genes in the cluster appear to be
well conserved among species at the gene subfamily level
(Figure 4). This suggests that the ancestral fish V2R gene
cluster was already present in the most recent common
ancestor of the four fishes. In zebrafish, two gene clusters
were found on chromosomes 17 and 18. Two indirect
pieces of evidence strongly suggest that the two zebrafish
V2R gene clusters originated from one chromosomal
translocation occurred in the zebrafish lineage. First,
genes in each of these clusters were not phylogenetically
clustered (Figure 3). Second, a genomic region near one
gene in subfamily 12 (12-1) that contains several genes in
subfamilies 7, 9, and 10 were lacking only in the zebrafish
chromosome 18 gene cluster (Figure 4), and these genes
were located on the chromosome 17 gene cluster (Figure
4).
From the synteny of neprilysin, PLC-η2, and several genes
between fishes and tetrapods, we could identify the
genomic region of tetrapods that corresponds to the fish
genomic region containing the V2R gene cluster (Figure
5). Physical maps of this region (Figure 5) show that the
V2R gene cluster located between neprilysin and PLC-η2 is
fish-specific and are not found in tetrapods. This indicates
that the V2R gene cluster in fishes has been originated
after the separation of teleost and tetrapod lineages. The

maps also show that one or more family C V2R genes are
located near SLC33A1 and GMPS genes commonly found
in the zebrafish, frog, mouse, and human in common.
This suggests that the family A+B of fish V2Rs has been
originated by a tandem duplication of the ancestral V2R
gene occurred before the divergence of teleosts and tetrapods (Figure 3), and the family C of V2Rs is the sister of
the family A+B (see also Figure 3). This may also indicate
that one of the ancestral V2R family A+B located in the
genomic region between neprilysin and PLC-η2 was
increased in their number by tandem gene duplications,
only in the lineage of teleosts, but not of tetrapods.
In the last part of this section, we summarize the longterm evolutionary scenario of the fish V2R gene family.
Before the divergence of teleost fish and tetrapod lineages,
an ancestral V2R (family A+B) gene and family C V2R
gene had diverged from one common ancestral V2R gene
by tandem gene duplication. After teleost-tetrapod divergence (ca. 480 MYA; Figure 1) [27], in the common ancestor of the four fishes, prototypes of fish V2R gene
subfamilies observed in the present fishes (Figure 3) had
been generated by tandem gene duplications from the
ancestral V2R (family A+B) gene. Then, these prototype
V2R genes formed a gene cluster. During the evolution of
the lineages of the four fishes, gene duplications and
losses occurred in each of these lineages. In the zebrafish
lineage that had diverged from other fish lineages at ca.
320 MYA, the V2R gene cluster separated into two, and
genes in subfamilies 9 and 16 have increased their numbers within the gene clusters in chromosomes 17 and 18,
respectively. In the medaka lineage (diverged from fugu
and pufferfish lineage at ca. 190 MYA), subfamily 4 genes
have increased their copies within the gene cluster. In the
fugu and pufferfish lineage, it appears that V2R sequences
in some subfamilies are pseudogenized only in the pufferfish (Table 1). For instance, in subfamily 4, fugu has five
putatively functional genes, but in pufferfish, four out of
five are pseudogenes. Similarly, in subfamily 16, fugu has
seven genes and one pseudogene, whereas pufferfish has
four pseudogenes and no functional gene. This implies
that, in the pufferfish lineage, after the separation from
the fugu lineage (ca. 85 MYA), some V2Rs might lose their
function by some biological reasons, such as the adaptation to freshwater environment. In the future, to elucidate
the more detailed evolutionary process of V2R (family
A+B) gene family, data from nonteleost fishes, namely
"ancient fish" [40], seem to be useful. In addition, to clarify the divergence period of V2R family to the other family
3 GPCR families, examination of Elasmobranchii fishes
(i.e. sharks and rays) may be one of important steps of
studies.

Functional significance of the genes located near the fish
V2R gene cluster
Two protein-coding genes, neprilysin and PLC-η2, are
located near the fish V2R gene cluster (Figure 5). Interestingly, it appears that the products of these genes can interact with V2Rs. Langenau and colleagues [41] reported that
the transcription of neprilysin was upregulated in the ovary
of yellow perch (Perca flavescens), incubating it with 17α,
20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (17, 20-P) that stimulated fish ovulation. Neprilysin is a membrane-bound
neutral peptidase expressed in various tissues [41]. Some
peptides that are cleaved by neprilysin may be released
into the water from individuals and spawned eggs, and
perceived by some V2Rs. Such peptides might be used as
a signal in reproduction and/or identity in fishes. Recent
studies in mammals have indicated that V2Rs are receptors for peptide sex pheromones [22] and MHC ligands
[23]. These studies may be consistent with the hypothesis
that fish V2Rs are also used to recognize peptides that
serve as reproductive and/or individuality signals. It is
also interesting that 17, 20-P is one of the components of
the pre-ovulately pheromone which affects male goldfish
[42].

PLC-η2 is one of the η-type phospholipase C, localized
specifically in neurons. V2Rs are included in the family 3
GPCRs, which is known to be coupled with phospholipase C [36]. Western blot analysis showed that, in mouse,
PLC-η2 protein was not localized in the olfactory epithelium or the vomeronasal organ [43]. This suggests that
PLC-η2 is not coupled with V2Rs; however, it was also
shown that PLC-η2 was localized in the main- and subolfactory bulbs [43]. This implies some functional relationship between PLC-η2 and the odorant recognition
system in vertebrates.
The close linkage between the genes encoding V2Rs and
neprilysin/PLC-η2 in fishes seems to be an intriguing
finding in light of the function of fish V2R genes. Functional studies of neprilysin and PLC-η2 could provide further information on the evolutionary mechanisms of fish
V2Rs.

Conclusion
In this paper, we have presented the repertoire of V2R
gene family in the four teleost fish species. The number of
intact V2R genes in these fishes varied from 12 in pufferfish to 46 in zebrafish. Phylogenetic analysis has shown
that the evolution of fish V2Rs are characterized by rapid
gene turnover and lineage-specific clustering, as known in
ORs and V1Rs [8,9,13,39]. Such evolutionary patterns
may suggest that fish V2Rs are involved in the lineage-specific adaptation to different odor environments for each
fish species. In addition, we elucidated substantial parts of
the long-term evolution of fish V2R gene family, by phyl-

ogenetic and comparative genome analyses. We believe
that our results provide one of the foundation to the
future functional and evolutionary studies of fish V2R
gene family.

Methods
Identification of fish V2R genes from draft genome
sequences
The 6.5× coverage of the zebrafish genome sequence
(Zv.5), 8.7× coverage of the fugu genome sequence (Fugu
version 4), and 8.3× coverage of the pufferfish genome
sequence (Genoscope Tetraodon 7) are available at
ENSEMBL [44]. The 6.7× medaka genome sequence is
available from the National Institute of Genetics (NIG)
DNA Sequencing Center, Mishima, Japan [45]. First, a
TBLASTN search was conducted with E-value 10-10 against
the genomic data by using the TM domain of several representative V2R amino acid sequences known in fugu,
goldfish, and zebrafish as queries. Obtained sequences
were confirmed by BLASTP searches against the NCBI
non-redundant (nr) database. In each of these sequences,
if the best hit in this search was a previously known fish
V2R, it was considered a V2R sequence. Second, each
region of BLAST similarity was extended in 5' and 3' directions to perform a detailed prediction of V2R coding
sequences. Each region of BLAST similarity was extended
4 kb in the 5' and 1 kb to the 3' direction. Gene prediction,
described as follows, was conducted in each of these
extended regions. After the first round of gene prediction,
if the total coding sequence of the V2R gene was not
included in this region, the 5' sequence was further
extended up to 10 kb.

For each of these regions, V2R coding sequences were estimated based on the profile HMM-based gene prediction
with the program WISE2 [46]. Seven full-length fugu [16]
and goldfish [10] V2Rs were aligned using the program
ClastalW [47] with the default settings. A profile HMM
was constructed from the alignment by using the program
HMMER software package [48], and used for gene prediction. In addition to V2R (families A+B and C) homologs,
CaSRs and a homolog of goldfish 5.24 amino acid receptors (GPRC6A) [28] were also identified. These "V2Rrelated" GPCR family 3 receptors were included in phylogenetic analysis. The obtained putative protein sequences
were examined by the TMHMM method [49] for the presence of seven transmembrane domains. Chromosomal
positions of putative V2R genes and pseudogenes in
zebrafish and pufferfish could be determined by mapping
them onto chromosome contigs. The list and sequences of
fish V2Rs are available as supplementary information
[Additional files 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

Phylogenetic analysis
Deduced amino acid sequences of 90 putatively functional V2R genes (including family C V2Rs) in zebrafish,
medaka, fugu, and pufferfish and several related GPCRs
(CaSRs, GPRC6As, and T1R taste receptors in some vertebrates) were aligned by using the program FFT-NS-i
(MAFFT 5.731) [50] and slightly modified by eyes. Seventeen vertebrate T1Rs were used as outgroups. Phylogenetic
tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method
[51] with JTT matrix distances [52] implemented in the
program MEGA 3.1 [53]. The reliability of each tree node
was assessed by the bootstrap method with 1,000 replications. The MP and ML trees were reconstructed by using
reduced dataset consisted of 45 representative fish V2R
(including family C) genes, three tetrapod V2R genes, and
nine related GPCR family 3 genes, because in these methods, it is virtually impossible to reconstruct trees from the
full dataset (134 OTUs). Initially, an alignment of nucleotide sequences of these genes were constructed based on
the alignment of corresponding amino acid sequences.
For the ML methods, the optimal model of sequence evolution was determined to be the Tamura-Nei + I + gamma
model by the hierarchical likelihood-ratio test implemented in MODELTEST 3.7 [54]. The ML tree was
searched by a heuristic-search algorism implemented in
PAUP 4.10 b [55]. Similar to the ML tree reconstruction,
the MP tree was also obtained by a heuristic-search algorism implemented in PAUP 4.10 b. The reliability of MP
tree nodes was assessed by the bootstrap method with
1,000 replications. In the MP and ML trees, the fugu T1R1
sequence was used as an outgroup.
Identification of tetrapod genomic regions corresponding
to the region in fishes with the V2R gene cluster
Initially, several protein-coding genes were characterized
around V2R gene clusters in zebrafish, medaka, and pufferfish, by using ENSEMBL genome browser [44]. Fugu was
not included in this analysis because fugu V2R clusters
were separated into at least four unconnected scaffolds
and thus we could not identify the gene order around V2R
clusters. Next, putative orthologs of these genes were identified in the genomic sequences of the frog, chicken,
mouse, and human by TBLASTN searches. The identities
of these putative orthologs were confirmed by "reciprocal
best hits" of TBLASTN searches between fishes and tetrapods.
