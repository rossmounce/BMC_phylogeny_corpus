Abstract
This paper is a commentary on "Species concepts for trypanosomes: from morphological to
molecular definitions?" by Wendy Gibson published in this journal [1]. Taxonomy has been
traditionally based on expert opinion which is influenced among other factors by the philosophical
and educational background of the expert concerned. This has resulted in widely different criteria
for species among the trypanosomatids when compared to the actual genetic diversity involved.
Gibson's paper presents an example of this within the trypanosome sub-genera. Although attempts
have been made to put taxonomy on a more objective basis expert opinion still appears to
dominate in the actual classifications in use.

Taxonomists have been traditionally divided between
"lumpers" and "splitters". The former tend to reduce species to the minimum number necessary and are extremely
wary of creating new divisions. The latter attach great
importance to variations between organisms and prefer to
name each variant discovered in the belief that otherwise
it may be lost. Although all taxonomists do not hold such
extreme views most will tend in one direction or the other.
As Gibson has pointed out in her paper [1] the biological
species concept provides no clear guidance on defining
species in groups such as the trypanosomatids, whose predominant mode of reproduction is asexual. It is therefore
left to the expert knowledge of taxonomists to make
judgements regarding which groups deserve species status. Other subjective factors however effect this judgement
besides the tendency to splitting and lumping mentioned
above. Taxonomists may be "idealists", such as some phylogeneticists who want their classification to reflect the
"true" evolutionary history of the organisms and therefore
their species to be phylogenetically monophyletic; Or
they may be "pragmatists", more concerned about the
utility of their classification and whether organisms assign

to given species provide information about those species
which usefully differentiates them as compared to other
species assignments.
The medical or conversely zoological interest of the taxonomist may also affect their judgement in creating species.
Clinicians often favour more conserved taxonomies, specially where the prognosis and treatment of the disease
caused by the differing aetiological agents is the same.
Zoologists frequently wish to create differing species to
correlate with ecological and host differences of the parasites. Parasites of medical and veterinary interest naturally
receive the most attention from taxonomists and are most
liable to splitting while less attention is paid to free living
and other parasitic trypanosomatids which may be
lumped into larger species groupings by neglect. It is
therefore not surprising that inconsistencies in the assigning of species among different subgenera such as reported
by Gibson occur. Similar examples can be found among
other genera of trypanosomatids. For example the genus
Leishmania with dozens of named species has a similar
genetic diversity to that of the single species T. cruzi .

Do these inconsistencies matter? Again there is no agreement. It can be argued using the previous example that the
absence of separate species or subspecies within T. cruzi
when there is clear genetic divergence within the group
has hampered research in elucidating the causes of the different clinical and ecological manifestations of the infection caused by that organism. On the other hand the
plethora of species in Leishmania have been criticized by
some as confusing to clinicians and complicating the
teaching of the subject to students.
Although there have been many attempts to make the discipline of taxonomy more objective, such as those by pheneticists and cladists in the previous century, at least for
the trypanosomatids expert opinion still seems to hold
the dominant position. It remains to be seen whether the
hope expressed by Gibson that molecular taxonomy
holds the key will be realized and a more evidenced based
systematics of trypanosomatids arise.
