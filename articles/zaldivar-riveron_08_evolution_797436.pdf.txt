Abstract
Background: The braconid subfamily Rogadinae is a large, cosmopolitan group of endoparasitoid wasps characterised by
'mummifying' their lepidopteran host larvae, from which the adult subsequently emerges. Rogadines attack a variety of both
macro- and microlepidopteran taxa, although the speciose genus Aleiodes almost exclusively attacks macrolepidopterans. Here,
we investigate the phylogenetic history of the Rogadinae, revise their higher-level classification and assess the evolution of their
host ranges and mummy types. We also assess the divergence times within the subfamily and discuss the reasons for the
extraordinary evolutionary diversification of Aleiodes.
Results: Our Bayesian analyses weakly support the monophyly of the subfamily. A clade comprising all Aleiodes species and some
other taxa is not nested within the tribe Rogadini as previously supposed, but instead is recovered as sister to the Yeliconini,
with the remaining Rogadini genera being recovered as sister to the Stiropiini. The Rogadinae is estimated to have originated
during the mid to late Eocene, 36.1–51.62 MYA. Molecular dating gives a more recent origin for the Aleiodes clade (17.98–41.76
MYA) compared to the origins proposed for two of its principal lepidopteran host groups (Noctuidae: 60.7–113.4 MYA;
Geometridae 48–62 MYA). The Bayesian ancestral reconstruction of the emergence habits from the mummified hosts weakly
recovered an anterior emergence as the ancestral condition for the subfamily. Producing a hard mummy has evolved at various
times independently, though most of the species with this biology belong to the Aleiodes clade.
Conclusion: Based on our results, we erect the tribe Aleiodini nov. to include Aleiodes and Heterogamus stat. rev.
Cordylorhogas, Pholichora and Hemigyroneuron are synonymised with Aleiodes. The molecular dating of clades and the ancestral
reconstruction of host ranges support the hypothesis that radiation within Aleiodes s. s. was due to host recruitment leading to
host range expansion followed by speciation, and not to parasitoid-host coevolution. Within the Rogadinae, variation in the site
of emergence from the mummified host probably evolved as a consequence of the mummy's site and mode of formation, and
the extent of mummy tanning/hardness to the degree of protection needed in relation to the cost of providing it.

Background
Approximately one out of ten insect species is a parasitoid,
that is, their larvae develop by feeding on or in other
arthropods, which they eventually kill. Most parasitoid
insects are hymenopterans, and an important fraction of
these belong to the family Braconidae. Study of insect parasitoids is important in order to characterise their biodiversity, understand their evolution, and in some cases
make use of their parasitic abilities for practical purposes,
such as biological pest control [1]. In this paper we focus
on the evolution of the Braconidae subfamily Rogadinae,
a cosmopolitan and highly diverse group of Lepidopteraparasitizing wasps with exclusively koinobiont biology,
i.e., allowing the recovery and subsequent temporary
development of the host after attack [2-4]. The rogadines
are currently divided into four tribes, the Clinocentrini,
Stiropiini, Yeliconini and Rogadini [5-7] (Figure 1). The
latter is by far the most diverse as it contains the highly
speciose and widely distributed genus Aleiodes Wesmael,
with more than 300 of the approximately 500 species currently described for the subfamily [5-7]. Rogadines are
currently defined only by a single biological synapomorphy, the 'mummification' of the host larvae [5], whereby
the wasp deposits her egg (or eggs in a few cases) inside a
host caterpillar which, after the parasitoid larva has completed feeding, turns into a variously hardened and
tanned mummy within which the parasitoid pupates. It
has been proposed that this complex strategy has resulted
from selective pressures that are intimately related to the
biology of a particular host species, and the results are
apparent from the observed variability of mummy type
within and between the tribes [8,9].
Despite the scant knowledge of host ranges within Rogadinae, a variety of lepidopteran host groups have been confirmed. Species of the Stiropiini, Clinocentrini and
Yeliconini are only known to attack 'microlepidopteran'
larvae [8,10,11], most of which are concealed feeders
[12]. On the other hand, members of Rogadini, as currently recognised [13], attack both micro- and macrolepidopteran larvae [8], the latter generally having exposed
feeding habits [12,14]. In Aleiodes, however, parasitism
has been observed to occur almost exclusively on macrolepidopteran hosts, although some microlepidopterans
with similar exposed feeding habits (e.g. species of Zygaenidae, Yponomeutidae and Pterophoridae) are also
attacked by a few species, and only in rare cases does Aleiodes attack macrolepidopterans living in semi-concealed
situations [7].
The few molecular phylogenetic analyses that have examined the evolutionary relationships within the Rogadinae
have been constrained by limited taxon sampling. Chen et
al. [15] presented the only molecular phylogenetic study
devoted exclusively to the subfamily but included only 20
species collectively representing nine genera, and the work

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/329

was based on a single DNA sequence fragment (449–482
bp of the D2 variable region of the 28S rDNA gene).
Although most of the relationships investigated could not
be resolved with confidence, the Rogadini and its subtribes were not recovered as monophyletic.
More recently, Zaldívar-Riverón et al. [16] carried out a
simultaneous molecular and morphological phylogenetic
analysis among the cyclostome subfamilies of Braconidae
(braconids have traditionally been divided into two major
groups, the cyclostomes and non-cyclostomes, based on
the presence/absence of an oral opening formed by a ventrally concave clypeus). They employed two gene regions
(28S rRNA and COI mtDNA genes) and included representatives of 15 rogadine genera and 19 species. They
recovered a weakly supported monophyletic Rogadinae
[16] and some relationships that were not concordant
with the existing classification of the group, including a
non-monophyletic Rogadini, with most members recovered as the sister group of Stiropiini, and with an Aleiodes
clade sister to Yeliconini.
Neither of the above studies dealt with the evolution of
mummification nor host ranges, nor did they estimate
divergence times. Here we reconstruct the first extensive
phylogeny for the Rogadinae using a combination of cytochrome oxidase I (COI) mtDNA and 28S rDNA gene
sequences. Based on the trees obtained, we evaluate the
current higher-level classification of the Rogadinae. We
also estimate times of divergence and assess the evolution
of host ranges and mummification within the group.
Finally, we discuss the driving force for the extraordinary
diversification within Aleiodes

Results
Molecular phylogenies
The Bayesian topologies obtained from the separate 28S
and COI analyses are shown in Figures 2 and 3. The 28S
topology has a considerably higher number of clades with
Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP) ≥ 0.8 compared to
the COI one (28S: PP 0.8–0.94 = 72, PP ≥ 0.95 = 61; COI:
PP ≥ 0.8–0.94 = 34, PP ≥ 0.95 = 44). The two separate
analyses recover a number of similar relationships, and
there are no significantly supported clades in conflict
between them. Among the similar relationships recovered
by both separate analyses are a clade with the species of
Aleiodes Wesmael, Cordylorhogas Enderlein, Hemigyroneuron Baker and Pholichora Achterberg ('Aleiodes clade' hereinafter) (PP: 28S = 0.69; COI = 0.45), a Yeliconini +
Aleiodes clade (PP: 28S = 0.7; COI = 0.52), and a clade
with the remaining Rogadini genera (PP: 28S = 1.0; COI =
0.96).

The phylogenetic affinities of the two examined members
of the non-rogadine tribe Cedriini, Cedria Wilkinson and
Carinitermus Achterberg, vary considerably between the

separate and simultaneous analyses. These taxa appear
weakly supported in the simultaneous analysis at the base
of the Aleiodes + Yeliconini clade, a highly unlikely relationship considering the extreme difference in morphological and life history features. We therefore carried out
an additional simultaneous analysis excluding both
Cedria and Carinitermus. The topology of the latter analysis was similar to the one that included the above two genera, and thus we only show the topology that excluded
them.
Figures 4 and 5 show the 50% majority rule consensus
tree derived from simultaneous analysis of the two gene
fragments. This has considerably more clades with PP ≥
0.8 (PP 0.8–0.94 = 101; PP ≥ 0.95 = 80) than either of the
topologies from the separate analyses. Among the significantly supported relationships that are congruent with the
current classification of Rogadinae are the monophylies of
Clinocentrini, Stiropiini, and Yeliconini (PPs = 0.93, 1.0,
and 1.0, respectively). The Rogadinae and Lysiterminae
were also found to be monophyletic, though with weak
support (PPs = 0.35 and 0.75, respectively). Some other
relationships, however, are in disagreement with current
taxonomy. Members of the Rogadini (sensu van Achterberg [13]) are grouped in two separate clades. One of
these, with significant support (PP = 1.0), consists largely
of the included species of Aleiodes (PP = 0.86), which form
the sister group to the Yeliconini (PP = 1.0). The second
clade (PP = 0.4) contains most of the remaining Rogadini
species (PP = 1.0) as sister group to the Stiropiini (PP =
1.0) and with the Clinocentrini (PP = 0.94) at the base.
The Betylobraconinae (sensu Belokobylskij et al. [17]) was
not recovered as monophyletic, with the Australian Mesocentrus Szépligeti and Betylobracon Tobias instead forming
a grade between Lysiterminae and Rogadinae, and with
Aulosaphobracon as sister group of all of them (PP = 0.53).
The Aleiodes clade additionally includes members of
another three genera, Pholichora, Hemigyroneuron and
Cordylorhogas. Relatively few of the species groups proposed by Fortier and Shaw [18] for which we included
more than one representative were significantly supported, but rather the relationships were congruent with
the currently recognised subgeneric classification of Aleiodes (Figure 5). Their A. dispar (Haliday) group (PP = 1.0),
with the exclusion of A. punctipes (Thomson), forms the
sister group to a clade with the subgenus Arcaleiodes + the
remaining Aleiodes species (PP = 1.0). The two other
groups proposed by Fortier and Shaw [18] that were
recovered were the A. gasterator (Jurine) and the A. circumscriptus (Nees) [including A. esenbeckii (Hartig) and A. sp.
8] groups. The species known to produce suspended
mummies [9] appeared significantly supported as monophyletic (PP = 1.0). The 28S motif TGCGT located at positions 264–268 [stems 3i'-3j of the 28S braconid secondary

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/329

structure model of Gillespie et al. [19]] in our alignment
is highly conserved within the Rogadinae and within the
Braconidae in general, and is retained in the dispar group;
however, the homologous positions in the remaining
Aleiodes species as well as in Pholichora, Hemigyroneuron
and Cordylorhogas display a derived AGCGT motif.
A clade with the members of the subtribe Spinariina with
the inclusion of Cornutorogas (PP = 0.56) appears deeply
nested within the clade including the remaining members
of Rogadini (defined in a restricted sense, i.e. excluding
the species assigned to Aleiodes together with Pholichora,
Hemigyroneuron and Cordylorhogas). The Neotropical species of Triraphis constitute a significantly supported clade
(PP = 1.0) that excludes the only Old World species of this
genus included here.
None of the credible set of trees obtained from the simultaneous analysis recovered Aleiodes as currently constituted as monophyletic, nor a monophyletic Triraphis,
Rogadini (including Aleiodes) and Rogadina (i.e. excluding Spinariina), and thus these alternative hypotheses are
statistically rejected.
Ages of diversification in Rogadinae
The times of divergence of selected clades (mean, standard
deviation and range) using the penalised likelihood (PL)
and Bayesian relaxed phylogenetics (RP) approaches are
given in Table 1 and the chronogram for RP is shown in
Figure 6.

Because of the uncertainty associated with the calibration
of the Aleiodes s. l. clade (see Figure 6 for identifying this
clade), we ran PL both including (PLiA) and excluding
(PLeA) the calibration associated to Aleiodes s. l. Ten of the
fifteen clades that were examined in the two PL analyses
have a PP value equal to or higher than 0.95 in our 28S +
COI Bayesian phylogeny, and thirteen of them higher
than 0.8 (Figures 4 and 5). The taxonomic composition of
the clades examined using the PL approach was the same
as for the 100 sampled trees except in two relationships,
which were not present in four and one of the sampled
trees, respectively (see Table 1).
The RP analyses including (RPiA) and excluding (RPeA)
the Aleiodes s. l. node calibration both recovered most of
the relationships found using MrBayes except for the
Rogadini + Stiropiini clade, which was not recovered in the
RPeA analysis. The age estimates of clades obtained by the
two RP analyses are generally similar; thus, we only show
the ultrametric tree derived from the RPiA analysis,
because it incorporated more node calibrations (Figure 6).
The age estimates derived from the two RP analyses are
generally earlier than those from the PL ones (Table 1).

The lineage that led to the extant members of the Rogadinae is estimated to have diverged during the late to mid
Eocene (36.1 to 51.62 MYA). Among the rogadine tribes,
the age of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of
the Stiropiini and Yeliconini diversified between the late
to mid Miocene (9.55 to 32.62 MYA) and the late Eocene
to early Miocene (16.79 to 41.58 MYA), respectively. The
MRCA of the Rogadini (excluding the Aleiodes clade) on
the other hand was estimated to diverge during the late
Miocene to mid Eocene (21.03 to 44.09 MYA). Of the four
molecular dating analyses performed, the PLeA had a considerably younger age estimate for the origin of the MRCA
of the Aleiodes clade (17.98 to 38.07 MYA; late Miocene to

early Eocene) in comparison to the remaining PL and RP
analyses (28.12 to 41.76 MYA; mid Oligocene to mid
Eocene).
Evolution of host ranges and mummification
The MP and Bayesian ancestral states of selected clades for
the three biological features examined – host and site of
emergence and hardening of mummy – are shown in
Table 2. The Rogadinae ancestral condition for the site of
emergence from the mummified host was recovered as
equivocal with MP but anterior with the Bayesian
method, though its ancestral posterior probability (APP)
was very low (APP = 0.21). The Stiropiini and the

emergence as ancestral conditions with MP and Bayesian
methods (APPs = 0.83 and 0.44, respectively). The ancestral reconstructions of the basal Rogadinae clades for the
degree of hardness of the mummy were recovered as
equivocal (MP) and with low APP values. Forming a hard
mummy, however, appears marginally as nonsignificant
in the Aleiodes clade. The latter condition also appears to
have evolved independently in a few members of the
Rogadini clade (Cystomastax and some species of Triraphis) and in some species of Clinocentrus.
Use of microlepidopteran hosts was recovered by both
methods as the ancestral condition for the Rogadinae, but

only with a low APP with the Bayesian method. In any
case, a shift to attack macrolepidopteran hosts appears to
have occurred independently in various lineages within
the Rogadini clade and once more in the Aleiodes clade.
Moreover, our analyses show an expansion to attack various lepidopteran host groups in the Aleiodes clade, with
the basal groups generally parasitising Noctuidae species
whereas the derived ones attack other macrolepidopteran
groups, including other families of Noctuoidea (e.g.
Notodontidae, Lymantriidae, Arctiidae) as well as species
of Geometridae, Thyratiridae, Lasiocampidae, Satyridae,
Hesperiidae and Sphingidae, and rarely also a few microlepidopterans with exposed larval feeding habits (see also
[7]).

Maximum parsimony and Bayesian (using the BayesTraits program) ancestral reconstructions of the three biological features examined in this study.
Ancestral posterior probabilities were obtained by multiplying the mean ancestral character state probability of the selected node across all trees
by the portion of the trees that recovered the node involved. Numbers on the first column correspond to selected clades that are indicated in the
28S + COI Bayesian topology (see Figures 4 and 5).

Discussion and conclusion
Phylogenetic relationships and taxonomic inferences
Here we present the most extensive phylogenetic analysis
within the Rogadinae to date based on DNA sequence
data. Our study covered representatives of the different
supraspecific taxa within the subfamily, as well as a
number of putatively closely related groups that have previously been considered to belong to this group (viz. Betylobraconinae, Lysiterminae, Pentatermus Hedqvist; e.g.
[13]). Our simultaneous analysis recovered a monophyletic Rogadinae as currently recognised, though with a
non-significant PP. This, and the placement of the betylobraconines Mesocentrus and Betylobracon at the base of the
Rogadinae clade leave the actual extent of the subfamily
unresolved and probably the Betylobraconinae ought to
be synonymised with the Rogadinae, especially if it were
found that they mummify their hosts. Further work is also
needed to confirm the phylogenetic position of the Clinocentrini. Unlike previous studies that recovered Clinocentrini at the base of the Rogadinae [15,16], in our study this
tribe appeared weakly supported as sister group of the Stiropiini + Rogadini clade.

In the separate 28S and COI analyses as well as in the
simultaneous analysis, the Aleiodes clade appears as the

sister group to the Yeliconini, whereas in the latter two
analyses a clade comprising the remaining genera of
Rogadini (i.e. in the new sense of excluding Aleiodes and
its close relatives) together with the Stiropiini was also
recovered (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5, respectively). Since these relationships are consistent between the two gene markers, we
propose the new tribe Aleiodini nov. for the members of
the Aleiodes clade, within which we recognise two genera,
Aleiodes and Heterogamus stat. rev. (see below).
The relationships recovered within Aleiodes s. l. were concordant with its subgeneric classification [13] except for
the only examined member of the subgenus Neorhogas,
which appeared deeply nested within a clade with the
members of the subgenus Aleiodes. Of the species groups
proposed for Aleiodes by Fortier and Shaw [18] based on
morphological evidence alone, only the A. dispar, A.
gasterator and A. circumscriptus groups were partially congruent with our molecular phylogeny. Of these groups,
the A. dispar group should be treated as a separate genus
according to its phylogenetic position and morphological
distinctiveness [Heterogamus stat. rev.: type species A. (H.)
crypticornis Wesmael = H. dispar (Haliday)]. Moreover, the
derived 28S AGCGT motif present in Aleiodes s.s. is absent
in Heterogamus. Members of Heterogamus can be morpho-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:329

logically distinguished from Aleiodes s. s. by having a considerably elongated hind trochantellus. Also, Heterogamus
species all have forewing vein r relatively long in relation
to vein 3-SR, though this state is also displayed by a range
of Aleiodes s. s. species. An elongate head with a low
clypeus (below lower level of eyes), narrow and usually
(in females) somewhat banded wings, and long pronotum are also distinctive features in Heterogamus, though
these are also occasionally present in some species of Aleiodes (Shaw and van Achterberg, unpubl. data). Further,
the venom gland apparatus in examined members of Heterogamus appears to be less modified than those present in
the species of Aleiodes s. s. [20], which is congruent with
the basal position recovered for this taxon within Aleiodini.
The three previously-recognised genera that were recovered as nested within Aleiodes s. s., i.e. Pholichora, Hemigyroneuron and Cordylorhogas, are distinguished by the
possession of various derived morphological features (e.g.
vein cu-a of fore wing strongly curved in Hemigyroneuron,
vein 1-1A curved subapically and subbasal cell with a pair
of patches in Pholichora, and posterior corner of first metasomal tergite acutely protruding and second tergite with
crest-like lateral carina in Cordylorhogas [13]). However,
these genera also possess morphologies characteristic of
Aleiodes, such as tarsal claws without a basal lobe, setose
hind tibial spurs, and otherwise similar wing venation
and metasomal carination [13]. Also Pholichora, Hemigyroneuron and Cordylorhogas have the derived AGCGT 28S
rDNA motiff (see above). Based on the latter information
and our molecular phylogeny, we therefore synonymise
the above three genera (Hemigyroneuron: type species H.
speciosus Baker; Pholichora: type species Hemigyroneuron
madagascariensis Granger; Cordylorhogas: type species C. trifasciatus Enderlein) with Aleiodes (syn. nov.), and all species currently classified within each of these are hereby
transferred to Aleiodes (comb. nov.). We therefore propose that Aleiodes s. s. should be represented by the subgenera Aleiodes (including Neorhogas and Cordylorhogas),
Chelonorhogas (including Hemigyroneuron), Pholichora and
Arcaleiodes.
Two further relationships recovered here are also supported by features of the venom gland apparatus [20].
One of them, supported by the presence of a hard secondary venom duct with filaments, consistently shows that
Spinariina is actually a derived group within the Rogadini,
and thus the subtribal names employed within Rogadini
(viz. Rogadina and Spinariina) should be eliminated. The
other relationship, supported by the presence of distinct
secondary venom duct branching patterns, suggests a
polyphyletic Triraphis, with the American species being
more closely related to other members of the Rogadini
rather than to the only examined Old World species of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/329

this genus. Members of Triraphis from the New World had
previously been assigned to Rogas (e.g. [20,21]); however,
a recent study based on van Achterberg's [13] definition of
rogadine genera revealed that all the examined species
from the New World previously assigned to Rogas actually
belong to Triraphis (sensu lato) and that Rogas may be
absent from this region [22].
Ages of diversification in the Rogadinae
The oldest cyclostome fossil that has been found to date
(93 MYA [23]) has a considerably more recent age than
the times of origin estimated for Ditrysia, which is the lepidopteran group that comprises all the taxa attacked by
rogadines and that has been calculated to have originated
157.6 to 191.9 MYA [24]. The available fossil evidence
thus indicates that the Rogadinae originated considerably
later than its host group, with our molecular dating estimates showing that its MRCA originated during the mid
to late Eocene. Our molecular dating estimates also show
that the Aleiodini has a more recent origin (late Miocene
to mid Eocene) than the origins estimated for two of its
most frequently attacked lepidopteran families,
Geometridae (48–62 MYA; mid Eocene to mid Paleocene
[25]) and Noctuidae (60.7 to 113.4 MYA; mid Paleocene
to mid Cretaceous [24]). Species of the remaining rogadine tribes often attack members of various basal ditrysian
families (i.e. microlepidopterans), and thus their origins
also are considerably more recent than those estimated for
their hosts.

The short internal branches and low support for several of
the relationships within the subgenus Aleiodes, which
comprises most of the known diversity within the genus
suggests a rapid radiation, although other factors, such as
lower phylogenetic signal may also explain this pattern
[26,27]. The inclusion of additional markers should help
to clarify whether there has been a rapid radiation within
the group. A rapid radiation has also been proposed
within Braconidae for the microgastrine group of genera
(40–50 MYA; [28]).
Evolution of mummification and emergence
characteristics
The lack of host records and/or preserved host mummies
for several rogadine genera, as well as our failure to
recover some key relationships (e.g. placement of Clinocentrini), prevent us from drawing strong conclusions
about the evolution of mummification characteristics
within the subfamily. However, whether Clinocentrini is
the sister group to the Rogadini + Stiropiini clade or the
sister group of the remaining rogadine tribes, a weak hardening of the mummy is most likely to be the ancestral condition for the subfamily. Producing a hard mummy could
have evolved repeatedly in separate lineages, though this
condition is mainly found in species of the Aleiodini. An

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:329

anterior site of emergence from the mummified host
would be the most plausible ancestral state if the Clinocentrini is confirmed as the sister group of the remaining
rogadine tribes.
The dorsal emergence from the mummified host observed
in all examined species of Stiropiini, Yeliconini and Aleiodini presumably occurs in response to the avoidance of
physical obstruction at other orientations. In the Stiropiini this may occur because the host is prepupal in a
cocoon ventrally attached to a hard substrate, and in Yeliconini because the prepupal mummy itself is curved
under at both extremities [8]. The particular shift to
exactly posterodorsal emergence in members of Aleiodini
might be associated with the anteroventral fixing of the
mummy (typically formed from an only partly grown caterpillar) to a hard substrate, which creates a barrier to
emergence through the mummy's more contracted and
harder anterior end.
This presumably derived feature is retained in the Aleiodini even in species that (apparently secondarily) have
adopted a mummification procedure that avoids this
source of obstruction (e.g. A. pallidator, which produces a
loose mummy in a host-produced roomy silk chamber;
and species of the 'suspended mummy' clade within Aleiodes s. s. [9]). Posterodorsal emergence orientations are
also retained in the few gregarious species of Aleiodes [8],
in marked contrast with the more chaotic emergence seen
in gregarious genera of Rogadini s. s. such as Colastomion
and Macrostomion [8,29]. On the other hand, in the species of the Clinocentrini and most Rogadini s. s. the host
is killed in its cocoon (albeit sometimes precocious in
Clinocentrus [2]), with typically no radial impediment,
and consequently the emergence position shows no
dorso-ventral restriction, but rather appears to occur more
or less at random. However, in Rogas, in which the configuration of the prepupal mummy positions the host head
capsule ventrally, and in Triraphis, in which the part grown
larval mummy is attached ventrally to a substrate, dorsal
emergence is seen.
The degree of hardening of the mummy produced by
rogadine species from their host's integument appears to
owe much to the need for protection of the parasitoid
metamorphosing within it bearing in mind that there will
be a cost in providing it. The known hosts of the Stiropiini, Clinocentrini, Yeliconini and most members of
the Rogadini are killed as prepupae, i.e. in prepared pupation sites, which probably offers substantial protection to
the parasitoid larvae and, especially when emergence is
rapid, little selection for the mummy to be especially
hard. Thus, relatively frail and pale-coloured mummies
are normal. A revealing exception is seen in the European
species Triraphis tricolor (Wesmael), whose part grown

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/329

host mummies are either fixed naked to a tree leaf and
emerge rapidly, when they are pale greenish yellow and
relatively frail, or fall from the leaf to overwinter on the
ground, in which case they are very well-tanned, dark
brown and tough (MRS, unpublished data).
Most known hosts of the Aleiodini, on the other hand, are
killed during early larval instars, and lack the protection of
the host's pupation site, with the result that the mummy
itself plays a more important role. Thus, the mummies of
these species are usually toughened and often strongly
darkened, whether or not the parasitoid diapauses in
them.
Evolution of host ranges
Use of microlepidopteran hosts was generally recovered
by the MP and Bayesian methods as the ancestral condition for both the Rogadinae and the Rogadini + Stiropiini
clade. Thus, our results suggest that a shift from attacking
semi-concealed microlepidopteran to exposed microlepidopteran (Zygaenoidea) or macrolepidopteran host taxa
has independently evolved in various lineages within the
Rogadinae.

Our ancestral reconstruction of host ranges and divergence time estimates contradict Fortier and Shaw's [18]
hypothesis of coevolution between Aleiodes s. l. and its
lepidopteran hosts. Based on their morphological estimate of phylogeny, they suggested that putatively basal
macrolepidopteran families (non-catocaline Noctuidae,
Sphingidae, Notodontinae) are attacked by basal species
of Aleiodes, whilst the most derived hosts ('trifine' Noctuidae) are attacked by derived parasitoid taxa. In our molecular phylogenetic estimate, however, Fortier and Shaw's
[18] supposedly derived A. dispar and A. gasterator species
groups appear instead, with significant support, to be at
the base of Aleiodini, and most of the species belonging
to their proposed basal A. circumscriptus, A. pallidator, A.
gastritor, and A. compressor groups are recovered in derived
clades.
Our results are more congruent with Shaw's [4,7] host
ecology hypothesis that explains the apparently rapid
radiation in Aleiodes s. s. In this hypothesis, the species of
Aleiodes s. l. that broaden their host range by recruitment
of new hosts, sometimes from additional lepidopteran
families, promote subsequent radiation within the group.
In contrast, other species of Aleiodes remain tied to phylogenetically restricted host taxa and so have less tendency
to radiate. In our molecular phylogeny, the most basal
clades (Heterogamus, the species assigned to the subgenus
Arcaleiodes and the A. gasterator and other species groups
of Fortier and Shaw [18] corresponding to the subgenus
Chelonorhogas sensu van Achterberg [13]), indeed do not
appear to be particularly species rich and seem to be

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:329

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/329

mostly restricted to attacking only Noctuidae, though the
hosts of Heterogamus and the subgenus Arcaleiodes remain
unknown (old published records, cf. [30] repeated in Fortier and Shaw [18], are almost certainly erroneous and
have never been repeated). In contrast, the intermediate
and derived clades (subgenus Aleiodes sensu van Achterberg [13]) comprise most of the species diversity within
the genus and exhibit a wide host range overall [7]. Within
this, specialist use of microlepidoptera taxa such as Zygaena (Zygaenidae), Ypsolopha (Ypsolophidae) and some
Pterophoridae, occurs infrequently, the species using
these hosts apparently being very closely related to species
that parasitise macrolepidoptera including morphologically similar species in similar feeding niches (MRS,
unpubl. data). Thus, the use of microlepidoptera by Aleiodes appears to be secondary. Moreover, in temperate
western European species (the biologically best known),
the expansions of host range that have been hypothesised
[4,7] to lead to speciation seem often to occur in species
having more than one generation a year, which often use
different and sometimes not closely related hosts successively. This plurivoltinism with 'discontinuous' host
ranges as defined by Shaw [7] is seen much more frequently in species of the subgenus Aleiodes than in the
subgenus Chelonorhogas. Members of the latter are mostly
univoltine and have 'continuous' host ranges.

terised by leaving their mummified hosts suspended
(known in three cases; unknown for A. sp. 7), which
appear to form a separate species group probably related
to the Asian A. buzurae He & Chen [9].

Methods

Molecular data
The gene markers analysed comprised a ~650 bp fragment
of the second and third domain regions of the nuclear 28S
rRNA gene, and a 602 bp fragment of the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) mitochondrial DNA gene. Most of the
sequences analysed were newly generated for this study,
but some were previously published elsewhere by us (see
Additional file 1). We also retrieved from GenBank the
28S sequence of A. (Arcaleiodes)aglaurus [15]. Genomic
DNA was extracted from alcohol-preserved specimens and
from dry-mounted material up to 15 years old. Detailed
information on the DNA extraction and PCR protocols
employed, primers selected and sequencing procedure of
PCR products is given in Zaldívar-Riverón et al. [16].

Taxon sampling
Our taxon sampling consisted of sequences from 34 genera and 118 species belonging to the previously recognised rogadine tribes Clinocentrini (4 genera, 4 spp.),
Stiropiini (3 genera, 3 spp.), Yeliconini (sensu Belokobylskij et al. [17]; 5 genera, 10 spp.), and Rogadini (22 genera, 101 spp.). Within the Rogadini, the species-rich genus
Aleiodes was represented by a total of 48 species. Our selection of the Aleiodes species included members from 13 of
the 17 species-groups proposed by Fortier and Shaw [18]
based on a morphological phylogenetic analysis that
comprised 208 species. The species groups not represented in our study were the A. gressitti (Muesebeck), A.
procerus Wesmael, A. pulchripes Wesmael and A. ufei
Walley groups. Our species sampling also represents van
Achterberg's [13] three proposed subgenera, Aleiodes
Wesmael, Chelonorhogas Enderlein and Neorhogas Szépligeti. We also included a specimen assigned to the subgenus Arcaleiodes Chen & He (sensu Belokobyslkij [31]),
which was originally described as a separate genus [15].
Moreover, we included a species belonging to the more
recently erected pilosus species-group [= Tetrasphaeropyx
Ashmead [32]] and 6 described and 15 undescribed morphologically diverse Aleiodes species without speciesgroup assignation. Among these are four Afrotropical species (A. mubfsi Quicke & Shaw, A. barnardae Quicke &
Shaw, A. travelyanae Quicke & Shaw, and A. sp. 7) charac-

Monophyly of the Rogadinae was tested by adding 40 terminal taxa belonging to most of the currently recognised
cyclostome braconid subfamilies. In particular, our outgroup sampling emphasised the small subfamilies Betylobraconinae, Lysiterminae, and Hormiinae, which appear
to be closely related to the Rogadinae according to previous molecular [16] and morphological [5,33] phylogenetic analyses. All the recovered trees were rooted using
Mesostoa kerri Austin & Wharton, of Mesostoinae. A Mesostoinae + Aphidiinae clade has been consistently recovered in previous studies as the sister group of the
remaining cyclostomes [16,34]. The Aphidiinae was not
represented in our study because the species of this group
display marked sequence length variation in the
sequenced 28S gene fragment, which considerably affects
the length of the unambiguously aligned positions in the
matrix.
The taxa examined, their localities and voucher and
EMBL/GenBank accession numbers are listed in Additional file 1.

Sequence alignment
Both 28S and COI sequences were aligned by eye. COI
alignment was confirmed by reference to the translated
amino acid sequence. The sequence length variable 28S
fragments were aligned following the braconid secondary
structure model of Gillespie et al. [19]. The ambiguously
aligned regions detected were further identified and characterised according to the categories proposed by
Gillespie [35]. Unfortunately, the vast number of terminal
taxa together with the extensive variation observed within
most of the detected 28S unalignable regions precluded us
from implementing the approach for recoding such
regions proposed by Zaldívar-Riverón et al. [16]. Thus, the

Page 14 of 20

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:329

11 unalignable regions that were delimited in our 28S
alignment were excluded from the subsequent analyses.
The 28S + COI matrix showing the braconid secondary
structure model followed for the 28S sequences is given in
Additional file 2. The above matrix and its resulting Bayesian topology can also be retrieved from the TreeBase web
page (http://www.treebase.org; study accession number
S2223).
Phylogenetic analyses
Separate and simultaneous analyses were carried out for
the 28S and COI data sets using the mixed-model Bayesian MCMC method as implemented in MrBayes version
3.1.2 [36]. Congruence between the two data sets was
assessed by detecting the significantly supported clades
[posterior probability (PP) ≥ 0.95] that were in conflict
between the two separate analyses [37,38].

All the Bayesian analyses were run for 30 million generations in Bioportal (University of Oslo; https://
www.bioportal.uio.no/). Each analysis consisted of two
searches, sampling trees every 1000 generations and using
four chains and default priors. The model of evolution
selected for the two data sets was the GTR+I+Γ, which was
determined based on the Akaike criterion implemented in
MrModeltest version 2.0 [39]. Five different partitions
were considered for the analyses, two for the stem and
loop 28S regions, respectively, and the three remaining for
the COI codon positions. Burn-in is usually determined
by stationarity of the likelihoods of the trees sampled,
which is usually reached quickly. This practice, however,
may not work so well for large data sets, where the appropriate sampling of the posterior distribution of the tree
topologies might take considerably longer [40]. We therefore took advantage of our large analyses and determined
the duration of the relevant burn-in phases based on the
constancy of the PPs for the 20 more unstable clades using
the online program AWTY [41]. Based on this conservative criterion, the burn-in phase in all analyses was determined to be after 20 million generations. We then
compared the topologies and PPs obtained in the two
independent searches run for the separate and combined
analyses. The independent searches were congruent in
their topologies and PP clade values in the three analyses,
and thus majority rule consensus trees (including compatible groups) of their pooled post burn-in trees were estimated. We considered clades as significantly supported if
they had a PP ≥ 0.95 [42].
A Bayesian approach for hypothesis testing [38,43,44]
was carried out to test the following hypotheses that were
absent in the majority rule consensus tree derived from
the simultaneous analysis of the two gene fragments: 1)
monophyletic Triraphis Nees (sensu Valerio [22]), 2)
monophyletic Aleiodes (including the species of the sub-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/329

genera Chelonorhogas, Neorhogas, Aleiodes and Arcaleiodes
and the species previously considered as Heterogamus, but
excluding Pholichora and Heterogamus), 3) monophyletic
Rogadini (sensu van Achterberg [13]), and 4) monophyletic Rogadina (considering Cornutorogas Chen,
Belokobylskij, Achterberg & Whitfield and Batothecoides
Watanabe as members of Spinariina, see results). A
detailed explanation of how this Bayesian approach was
implemented can be found in Zaldívar-Riverón et al. [45].
Divergence dates of clades
The molecular dating of selected clades was estimated
using two different relaxed molecular clock approaches:
the semiparametric penalised likelihood (PL; Sanderson,
2002) and the Bayesian relaxed phylogenetics (RP [46])
methods.

The PL method was performed with r8s version 1.7 [47].
The range, mean and standard deviation for PL were
obtained taking the last 50 trees (with their branch
lengths) sampled from each of the two independent
MrBayes runs (with 28S and COI combined; see above).
The truncated Newton algorithm was used, and a cross
validation [48] was first run on the majority rule consensus tree from the simultaneous Bayesian analysis to determine the optimal value of smoothing, which turned out
to be 10. Aspilodemon Fischer was deleted from the trees
examined to give a basal node separating Mesostoa Austin
& Wharton from the clade with the remaining terminal
taxa. The following terminal taxa were pruned from the
trees in order to avoid near zero branch lengths: A. sp.
near borealis (Thomson), A. gasterator (Jurine), A. cf. gastritor (Thunberg), A. pictus (Herrich-Schäffer), A. praetor
(Reinhard), A. ruficornis (Herrich-Schäffer), A. similis
(Curtis), A. (Heterogamus) sp. 2, A. spp 3, 9, and 10, Bulborogas sp. 1, Canalirogas sp. 1, Colastomion concolor (Szépligeti) specimen 2, species of Conspinaria Schulz except C.
sp. 4, Darnilia sp. 2, Gyroneuronella sp., Macrostomion sp. 2,
Rogas spp. 6 and 10, and species of Spinaria Brullé except
S. albiventris Cameron and S. sp.
The RP method was performed using BEAST [49]. The
data set was partitioned in four sets: 28S, and the first, second and third codon positions of COI. The same model
of nucleotide substitution was used for each of these partitions: GTR+I+Γ (selected by MrModeltest; see above).
Base frequencies were estimated by BEAST, and the
number of categories for the gamma distribution was
four. We included the same set of 129 taxa that we used
for the PL method. The relaxed molecular clock model
chosen was uncorrelated lognormal. The starting tree was
obtained with PAUP* using Maximum Parsimony [50]
and later linearised with r8s [47] with a tree height of 93
MYA (see below). We ran each analysis for 100 million
generations in eight separate runs, and with a sampling

frequency of 1/10,000 generations. Given the size of the
resultant files, and to make sure that the sampled chains
were stable, we discarded the first 80 million generations
of each run (burn-in), which was more than enough
according to what the chain inspector software Tracer v1.4
[51] suggested. We include the Beast files as Additional
files 3 and 4.
Fossil ages and node calibration
The correct identification of fossil taxa and an adequate
selection of calibration nodes are two of the most critical
steps in molecular dating estimation [52]. We fixed the
most basal node and set two or three different calibration
points based on the fossil taxa discussed below, which
were selected after a detailed examination of a number of
descriptions of cyclostome fossils. Several other cyclostome fossils have been described from different geological
periods [53], but unfortunately the generic assignations
for many of them are either incorrect or questionable.

The most basal node representing the cyclostome group
was fixed in the PL and RP analyses using the age of Protorhyssalus goldmani Basibuyuk, Rasnitsyn, Achterberg, Fitton & Quicke [93 million years ago (MYA) [23]]. An
apparently closely related fossil, Protorhyssalodes arnaudi
Perrichot, Nel & Quicke, of very similar age has been
recently confirmed to be a cyclostome and is the oldest
confirmed member of this group that has been found to
date (Perrichot, Nel and Quicke, submitted).
The MRCA of Aivalykus Nixon was calibrated based on the
fossil of A. dominicanus Zuparko & Poinar [54], which has
an age of 15–20 MYA according to the estimated age of the
Dominican amber [55]. Three species of Aivalykus were
included in the analyses in order to have a better representation of the oldest lineage within this genus. The MRCA
of Aivalykus was calibrated with a minimum age of 15
MYA in the PL analyses, whereas in the RP analyses this
was constrained to a normal prior distribution with a
lower bound of 15 MYA (5%) and a higher bound of 20
MYA (95%). We chose a normal distribution to reflect the
similar probability of the two bounds, and also to account
for the uncertainty associated with the long branch sustaining the node of Aivalykus' MRCA. That is, the dated
fossil might be from a time point considerably older than
Aivalykus' MRCA because of the long branch previous to
this MRCA (Figure 4), and therefore Aivalykus' MRCA
could not only be older than the fossil, as is always the
case due to the paucity of the fossil record, but also
younger.
We also selected the fossil ages of three rogadine species
that were described from the Baltic amber [56], Clinocentrus latitator Brues, C. latipennis Brues, and Rhogas (=
Rogas)fritschii Brues. Unfortunately, these fossils were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/329

destroyed during the Second World War and thus we
could not confirm the correct assignation of these taxa. A
detailed inspection of the original descriptions and the
Figures presented therein suggest the correct assignation
of the two first species within Clinocentrus, though they
show some atypical features that are absent in the extant
species of the genus. In the case of the fossil specimen
assigned to Rogas, its description unambiguously places it
within the Rogadinae but does not help to confirm its
generic assignation because is not clear whether it has the
only known external morphological feature known to distinguish Rogas from Aleiodes sensu van Achterberg [13], i.e.
tarsal claws with a basal lobe present. However, an examination of Brues' descriptions of other species assigned by
him to Rhogas revealed that his concept of the genus was
an idea (prevalent at the time) that encompassed Aleiodes
sensu van Achterberg [13]. For instance, R. bakeri Brues
and R. ecuadoriensis Brues have been subsequently reclassified as Aleiodes [57,58]. Moreover, according to Brues'
(1933) description, some of the morphological features
present in R. fritschii (e.g. ovipositor very short, antennae
with only 25 segments, though most extant species have
considerably more flagellomeres than this) appear to differ from the currently accepted concept of Rogas, but are
more similar to the ones displayed by Aleiodes sensu van
Achterberg (1991). Thus, it seems likely that the above
specimen belongs to Aleiodes sensu van Achterberg [13]
and not to Rogas. We therefore performed the PL and RP
analyses including the calibration ages estimated for the
Baltic amber to set the MRCAs of Clinocentrini and the
Aleiodes clade (i.e. Aleiodini; see results), and including
them to set the MRCA of Clinocentrini alone.
The age of the Baltic amber was originally proposed by
Kaplan et al. [59] to be of 37.7 ± 3 MYA based on the absolute age of the Prussian Formation, though it was subsequently changed by Ritzowski [60], who inferred for this
amber a Middle Eocene age (44.1 ± 1 MYA) based on radiometrically dated glauconite. The latter age estimate was
employed in a recent phylogenetic analysis among the
microgastroid genera [61]; however, it has been considered as doubtful by Perkovsky et al. [62] because it was
calculated based on an insufficient layer sampling. We
thus followed a conservative approach and set the MRCA
of Clinocentrus Haliday to have a minimum age of 34.7
MYA in the PL analyses. Given the uncertainties associated
with the fossil of Aleiodes s. l., we did two separate analyses
for the RP approach: including and excluding Aleiodini's
calibration. We used the same prior distribution for the
age of both Aleiodini and Clinocentrus MRCAs, an exponential distribution with a minimum age of 34.7 MYA
and a 45.1 MYA upper bound (95% limit). We chose an
exponential distribution with a zero offset of 34.7 to
reflect our higher confidence in this value than in the 45.1
MYA upper bound.

Evolution of host ranges and mummification
The evolution of lepidopteran host ranges and of two
mummification features (position of emergence hole and
degree of hardening of mummy) within the Rogadinae
were assessed using MP and Bayesian ancestral reconstruction methods. Reconstruction of ancestral states with the
MP method was performed mapping each character onto
our preferred Bayesian phylogeny with MacClade version
4.0 [63]. Bayesian ancestral reconstructions of selected
clades were carried with Bayestraits version 1.0 [64,65];
http://www.evolution.rdg.ac.uk), mapping each character
onto a posterior distribution represented by the last 250
topologies sampled from the two independent searches
(500 topologies in total) run for the simultaneous Bayesian analysis. Two searches of 10 million iterations each
were run for each character, sampling a reconstruction of
ancestral states every 500 iterations. We used a gammadistributed hyperprior of the transition probabilities
between states (rjhp exp 0.0 30) and a deviation rate of
the normal distribution of 2.0. Burn-in was determined to
be after 300,000 generations. The APP for the selected
nodes were obtained by multiplying the mean ancestral
character state probability of a given node across all trees
by the portion of the trees in which the node involved was
found [64,65].

Ten states were defined for the host ranges character [(0)
other insect groups, (1) Noctuidae, (2) other Noctuoidea,
(3) Geometridae, (4) Rhopalocera, (5) Sphingidae, (6)
Drepanidae + Thyratiridae, (7) Lasiocampidae, (8) Zygaenoidea, and (9) other microlepidopterans]. Four states
were defined for the site of emergence [(0) not applicable
because mummy absent, (1) anterior (Figures 7A, B), (2)
posterior (Figures 7C,E), and (3) gregarious, various irregular positions (Figure 7D)] and four for the hardening of
mummy [(0) absent, (1) weak (Figures 7C,D), (2) moderate, (3) hard (Figures 7E,F]. The host groups and mummification features recorded for the taxa examined are listed
in Additional file 5. We only accepted the host record
information that was confirmed after the direct examination of specimens and their host remains, though for a few
taxa we accepted literature records in the absence of other
evidence. In some cases, the host records given are those
known for the species sequenced; however, host assignations for the remaining species (species of taxa listed only
as genera in Appendix) were obtained from records of
