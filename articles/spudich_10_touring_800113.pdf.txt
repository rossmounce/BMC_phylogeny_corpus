Touring Ensembl: A practical guide to genome
browsing
Correspondence

Abstract
The number of databases in molecular biological fields has rapidly increased to provide a large-scale resource. Though
valuable information is available, data can be difficult to access, compare and integrate due to different formats and
presentations of web interfaces. This paper offers a practical guide to the integration of gene, comparative genomic,
and functional genomics data using the Ensembl website at http://www.ensembl.org.
The Ensembl genome browser and underlying databases focus on chordate organisms. More species such as plants
and microorganisms can be investigated using our sister browser at http://www.ensemblgenomes.org.
In this study, four examples are used that sample many pages and features of the Ensembl browser. We focus on
comparative studies across over 50 mostly chordate organisms, variations linked to disease, functional genomics, and
access of external information housed in databases outside the Ensembl project. Researchers will learn how to go
beyond simply exporting one gene sequence, and explore how a genome browser can integrate data from various
sources and databases to build a full and comprehensive biological picture.
Background
The ongoing increase in the number of databases in biological fields provides a large-scale resource. Last year
saw the development of nearly 100 new molecular biological databases, bringing the total number of popular databases in this field to over 1,000 [1]. However, different
formats and presentations of the GUIs (graphical user
interfaces) make it difficult to access data. Collecting biological information from various sources and comparing
them can be time consuming for the researcher. Genome
browsers provide an aid to the researcher by importing
biological data from various sources and presenting these
data in an integrated way.
Three multi-species genome browsers are widely used
by the scientific community: the UCSC genome browser,
NCBI Map Viewer, and Ensembl (Table 1). Others
include H-INvDB (for human) or the FlyBase genome
browser, and focus on one or a few species. These browsers not only display information, they tie together annotation from various sources and present it in an
integrated way to simplify the view of features along a
genome. This article focuses on the power of using a

genome browser to go beyond simple questions like
'where are histone modification sites found in the
genome' to a more integrated query such as 'where do
regulatory features and conserved regions match up in
the 5'UTR of a gene.' This allows a more hypothesisbuilding approach to determining new and undiscovered
regions of the genome that may confer function. Genome
browsers can be used to deduce function of novel proteins through association with other genes across species.
Scientists can use these data to support findings, or to
make new hypotheses to be tested through experimentation. The aim of this article is to show how information
annotated and presented in genome browsers can
enhance hypothesis-driven research.
We focus on the Ensembl genome browser in this article, though a similar approach can be used with other
genome browsers shown in table 1. The Ensembl project
focuses on the chordate genomes, with the inclusion of
additional model organisms that have been extensively
studied in biological research and have a reliable, manually annotated gene set (Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). In
addition to providing carefully predicted gene sets based
on experimental evidence (sequences from UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot [2], manually-curated sequences from NCBI
RefSeq [3], and sequences from UniProtKB/TrEMBL

(Table 1)), Ensembl includes annotation such as sequence
variation, comparative associations, mRNA and protein
from other databases, predicted features such as CpG
islands [4], and repeats and motifs mapped along the
genome. These annotations are graphically depicted
along the genomic assembly in order to allow easier visualisation of a gene neighbourhood or a stretch of
sequence.
Ensembl and other browsers provide displays of complex data sets that require time and computing power not
generally available to the researcher. Homology relationships based on gene comparisons across all annotated
species in Ensembl (53 species in release 55), along with
whole-genome alignments, such as alignments of 31
mammalian genomes, can be readily viewed in the
browser.

Case Studies
In the following four case studies, we use the Ensembl
genome browser to demonstrate how to view and predict
functional regions in the genome based on existing evidence. First, we examine known regulatory features for

the human IL2 gene and discuss how to display these features in Ensembl. These promoter and enhancer-related
elements can be readily exported using the BioMart tool
[5-7].
In study 2, we use human MYO6, a case in which gene
regulation is not well-understood. Using comparative
genomics, we show how the location of functional
sequences may be predicted. In case study 3, we demonstrate how the information in Ensembl can be extended
through DAS (the Distributed Annotation System)[8] to
view data from external sources. Finally, in study 4, we
explore a variation associated with disease phenotypes.
These case studies aim to show how data from different
sources can be viewed and compared for a gene or region
in Ensembl. For a walk-through of how to use the browser
to view comparative genomics, variations, and other
Ensembl resources, please see our videos[9] and previous
publications [10,11]

Case Study 1: Regulatory Regions for the IL2 Gene
We investigate IL2, the interleukin 2 gene, in human
(ENSG00000109471). Gene regulation has been studied

Spudich and Fernández-Suárez BMC Genomics 2010, 11:295
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/295

at the 5' end of the IL2 transcript and flanking sequence
[12-14]. Within only 200 bp upstream of the translational
start site, binding sites for proteins such as NF-κB, AP-1,
and NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells), DNase I
hypersensitive sites and a TATA box can all be found.
These regions have been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell mediated immune response[15,16].
The ENCODE pilot study [17]mapped promoter
regions and regulatory sequences in 1% of the human
genome, and this approach is now being extended to the
entire genome. Ensembl has made a first attempt at annotating these sequences genome-wide by producing a 'regulatory build' based on data from ChIP-Chip[18] and
ChIP-Seq [19] experiments (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis or sequencing,
respectively). The ensuing data in the 'Regulatory regions'
track in Ensembl are for specific cell types, and include
DNase I Hypersensitive sites, CCCTC-binding factor
(CTCF) sites, and Histone modification sites (including
methylation, acetylation, and alternate histone use)[20].
The IL2 gene possesses features from the regulatory build
on the flanking regions to the IL2 transcript (Figure 1).
Pop-up windows reveal more information for each
track if a feature is clicked. In figure 1, the pop-up window indicates a CTCF binding site in the regulatory features track. CTCF proteins are highly conserved zinc
finger proteins associated with transcriptional activation
and repression. Mutations in these genes are associated
with invasive breast cancers, prostrate cancers and
Wilms' tumours[21,22]. These sites have been recently
and extensively mapped onto the human genome[23] and
are included in Ensembl as part of the regulatory build.
Regulatory features can be exported using the BioMart
tool, or accessed via the Perl API from the Ensembl functional genomics database. An walk-through of the
BioMart web interface [24] is provided by Smedley et. al.
[5-7] Based on this, to download regulatory features,
choose the database as "Ensembl functional genomics"
and the dataset as the species of interest. Filters can be
applied to select by a region (for example chromosome)
or a specific type of regulatory feature (such as DNase I
hypersensitive site). Attributes output information (such
as chromosomal coordinates, or cell type) about these
specific features. For more information about feature
sources, and the Ensembl regulatory build, see Ensembl
documentation [25].
The "constrained elements" blocks (Figure 1, label 1)
are genomic regions that are highly conserved across 33
species, in this example. Constrained elements result
from GERP-scoring[26] of each base pair position within
a multi-species alignment. High GERP scores represent
the most conserved base pairs, and correspond to blocks
in the 'conservation' track. The constrained elements in
figure 1 align to the 5' and 3' ends of the Ensembl tran-

Page 3 of 10

script for IL2, and align with regulatory regions, indicating regions of high sequence conservation and thus,
possible function.
A third track displays data from 'CisRED'[27] a database of patterns and motifs associated with regulatory
regions, 'miRanda'[28] a collection of miRNA targets
identified in the genome, and the 'VISTA' enhancer set
[29] (Figure 1, label 2) Features in this track align to the
flanking regions to the IL2 coding sequence, and to the
conserved sequence blocks.
To look more closely at the nucleotide sequence itself,
we can view an alignment of the upstream region of the
IL2 gene across mammals at the base pair level (Figure 2).
To reach this page, click on 'Genomic alignments' at the
left of a gene or location page. The sequence in this
region is highly conserved across the eutherian mammals
shown. The presence of the NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) binding site and TATA box (in the promoter region) for the IL2 gene are boxed, along with the
translational start site (ATG). This is to illustrate how to
view conserved regions in a sequence, and how rich the 5'
sequence and flank can be in terms of binding sites and
regulatory elements.
The alignment display is highly customisable. Numbering can be turned on or off, and exons highlighted. Pairwise comparisons or multiple alignments can be
displayed at the nucleotide level. Alignments can be
exported using the export data link at the left of the view.

Case Study 2: Function for a Gene
In case 1, we investigated a gene for which there is information already known about promoter and enhancer elements. Although most human genes in Ensembl are
labelled as 'known', signifying a good match to a cDNA or
protein in a biological database such as UniProt or NCBI
RefSeq, many of these genes have un-investigated regulatory sequences. In addition, many proteins have
unknown function. How can we predict function for a
protein that is not well-understood in terms of its role in
the cell?
In this example we consider human MYO6,
ENSG00000196586, which has been studied in the mouse
model to understand its role in endocytosis and inner-ear
development[30,31]. What is known about this gene? We
can first look for mouse homologues for the human
MYO6 gene ENSG00000196586. Do so by clicking on the
orthologues link at the left of the gene tab for
ENSG0000196586. At the time of writing, one mouse
orthologue is known for human MYO6 (in Ensembl
release 55): ENSMUSG00000033577[32].
Orthologues and paralogues in Ensembl are determined using phylogenetic gene trees[33]across all available species (Figure 3). In these analyses, scores from
blast reciprocal hits are used to cluster proteins in

pair 123371793 to 123378703 [54], with the IL2 transcript in gold. Boxes show exons, and filled boxes show coding sequence. The direction of translation is indicated by the "<" next to the gene name, and the IL2 transcript is drawn under the blue bar (genome) showing it is on the reverse strand
of the chromosome. The constrained elements (label 1) are blocks of highly conserved base pairs resulting from whole genome sequence alignments
across 33 species. Regulatory regions from the cisRED and miRanda databases are indicated as coloured, vertical lines (label 2), and match well to the
5'UTR and 5' flank of the IL2 transcript. Regions such as histone modification, DNA methylation, CTCF binding, and DNase I hypersensitive sites are
shown as grey shaded boxes (for example, above and left of label 2). Clicking on a box will generate a pop-up window with more information (as
shown).

Ensembl for all species. The tree is built from high-scoring clusters. Paralogues result from gene duplications,
which are the red nodes in the tree. Orthologues result
from speciation events (blue nodes). Nodes in the tree
diagram can be clicked on for a duplication confidence
score (red nodes), the taxonomic group, and the protein
alignments within that branch (viewable through JalView
[34]).
The myosin 6 gene has been extensively studied in the
mouse. One way to quickly look for functions associated
with the myosin 6 gene is to observe the 'GO
terms'[35,36]. These terms are functional classifications
designated by the Gene Ontology project[37]. Classifications can be general (e.g. term GO:0005515 protein binding) or more specific (e.g. term GO:0014047 glutamate
secretion). GO terms are assigned either by manual curation or an electronic, gene-matching method. The GO
terms can be accessed through the transcript tab (the
gene ontology link at the left). Terms for one human myosin 6 transcript (ENST00000428345) are shown (Figure
4A). The method of GO term assignment is described by
a three-letter code. View this 'evidence code' next to the

GO term (click 'Help' or visit the GO website to read
more about the associations.) (Figure 4B) [38].
Many GO terms for the human MYO6 transcript have
been projected from mouse homologues (one example is
shown in figure 4A). Clicking on the mouse protein identifier ENSMUSP00000108893, then on the Gene ontology
link at the left shows the GO terms associated to the
mouse protein. Protein binding is 'inferred from physical
interaction
(IPI)'
in
transcript
ENSMUST00000113268[39].
The same GO term is listed for the human MYO6 gene
in figure 4A, based on homology to the mouse Myo6
gene. The evidence code 'IEA' or 'inferred from electronic
annotation' demonstrates a projected GO term. They
may aid in predicting functions for a protein, based on
homology.
Identifying sequences involved in gene regulation is
also important in understanding function. In case 1 we
looked at the region upstream of the IL2 gene, which is
rich with known regulatory regions. For the human
MYO6 gene, we can make some predictions using a similar approach to case 1.

Figure 2 Conserved Sequences for IL2. The sequence alignment between mutiple eutherian mammals is shown (Homo sapiens (human), Pan troglodytes (chimpanzee), Gorilla gorilla (gorilla), Pongo pygmaeus (orang-utan), Macaca mulatta (macaque), Mus musculus (mouse), and Rattus norvegicus
(rat)) [55]. Identical residues are shaded in blue, and the translation start for IL2 is shown by a yellow, highlighted box (ATG). Exons are indicated by red
sequence. A highly conserved TATA box [56]and NFAT binding site [57] are identified by the authors, and indicated in the figure (i.e. Ensembl does
not identify these). The view is accessible through the genomic alignments link at the left of the gene or location tabs.

The 'regulatory features' track in the 'region in detail'
view reveal DNase I hypersensitive sites and numerous
histone modification and methylation sites aligning to the
5'UTR and upstream region of MYO6 transcripts (Figure
5: see the pop-up window at the bottom centre of the figure).

into a tree diagram with clickable nodes depicting taxonomic clades,
evolutionary events, and links to protein alignments using JalView[34,58]. Red nodes correspond to duplication events, dark blue
nodes show speciation events, and light blue nodes are ambiguous
duplications. The filled green rectangles at the right demonstrate protein alignments. Light green alignments represent one protein, dark
green shading shows a consensus alignment for a collapsed node in
the tree. Black ticks in the green bars show positions of introns. Gaps
introduced in the alignments are white. Background colouring corresponds to clades, and can be switched off. The tree in the figure shows
the human MYO6 protein in red. The mouse orthologue is boxed.

Figure 5 Predicted Regulatory Features for Myosin 6. The upstream region and first exon for five myosin 6 transcripts are shown in 'Region in Detail' [60]. Regulatory features are drawn alongside the human genome along with MYO6 transcripts, which are on the forward strand. Variations are
also drawn and colour-coded indicating the position of the variation with respect to the gene (ie. intronic, upstream, coding). Clicking on variations
opens a pop-up box with specific information, and a link to the variation tab. The region shown is chromosome 6, base pairs 76441551 to 76501760.
Click on track names or annotation to reveal more information. In the diagram, the information boxes correspond to the regulatory features track.

The constrained elements track, and CisRED/
miRANDA/VISTA features are also selected in this
example. These indicate regions that may function in
gene regulation.
In addition, more elements associated with regulatory
regions can be displayed along the genome in this view.
For example, other elements associated with promoters
such as CpG islands[4,40,41], or those determined with
FirstEF [42] or Eponine[43] can be selected using the configure this page option at the left.
Conclusions from this case study can be drawn from
the GO term associations and the putative regulatory
regions. Proposed functions for the human MYO6 gene
and protein include actin filament binding and regulation
of secretion [39]. These are based on the known functions
of the human MYO6 gene homologous to mouse Myo6,
based on the gene tree. Furthermore, the regulatory build
indicates signatures of open chromatin such as CTCF
binding sites[21], DNase I hypersensitive sites, along with
histone modification sites. Open chromatin and histone
modification sites at the 5' end of MYO6 transcripts suggest a potential regulatory region (Figure 5). This

sequence could be further investigated for promoter
activity.

Case Study 3: Viewing information outside Ensembl
databases
The Distributed Annotation System (DAS)[8] allows
Ensembl to link out to and display information from
external databases in supported formats. DAS transforms
Ensembl into a framework where third party annotation
can be added and viewed alongside Ensembl annotation.
The DAS registry [44] provides a repository of external
sources, and makes it easy for users to select these data to
be displayed in Ensembl. These data can be viewed in the
browser along the genome, or as annotation for a gene or
transcript. This powerful system integrates data from
databases around the world, and is available for all species.
Figure 6 demonstrates how to view external data using
DAS along the genome. Data from the MICER[45] project (a resource containing vectors and information to
generate knock-out mice) is drawn for a region of the
mouse genome (Figure 6).

Figure 6 External MICER Resource. MICER clones have been selected in the configure this page menu for the mouse IL2 gene and surrounding regions (NCBIm37 chromosome 3, base pairs 37018158 to 37039973)[61]. The resulting blocks (arrows) represent data from the MICER database, and
contain links to MICER information.

To add DAS tracks to the Location views (Such as
Region in Detail, shown in figure 6), users can click on the
configure this page link at the left. A greater selection of
DAS tracks is found upon clicking manage your data at
the left, and then following the Attach DAS link to access
the DAS registry. In addition to viewing 'live' external
data with DAS, users may draw their own tracks along the
chromosome. User data can be displayed in Location
views, such as Region in Detail, a chromosome or karyotype[46].

Case Study 4: From phenotype to SNP- exploring
variation
A new feature in Ensembl is the ability to search with a
disease or phenotype. For example, searching for diabetes
in the main page results in 350 hits to genes, variations
and protein families across species. One of these hits is
rs2476601, which Ensembl reveals to have been implicated in Crohn's Disease and Rheumatoid Arthritis, in
addition to Type I Diabetes (Figure 7). This information
comes from the NHGRI GWAS catalogue [47], and links
to publications implicating the variation in the disease
and strongest risk alleles can be found in the phenotype
data section of Ensembl pages (Figure 7).
Population variation in Ensembl is imported from
NCBI dbSNP[48], among other sources[49], and is represented in a variety of views [50]. Clicking on a variation
identifier within the Ensembl website opens the variation
tab and brings the focus to data for one specific variation,
such as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or insertion-deletion (indel) mutation. Associated data such as
allele frequencies from genotype studies done by Hap-

Map [51] or Perlegen[52], or the phenotype information
described above can be found in this way.
Turning on the variation track in the region in detail
page reveals all SNPs, indels, and other variations stored
in Ensembl databases and mapped to the position viewed.
Position in and effect on the transcript is revealed by the
colour of the vertical line signifying the variation. In figure 8, non-synonymous variations (having an effect on
the amino acid sequence) are shown as yellow vertical
lines. The circled variation is rs2476601, the SNP
described above. This variation is within a coding exon in
two of the PTPN22 transcripts shown, and has a consequence on the protein sequence in these two splice isoforms. Clicking on the variation reveals a pop-up box
showing the ID, the genomic coordinates, and a link to
the variation tab shown in figure 7.

Results and Discussion
Genome browsers have gone beyond the simple display of
genes and transcripts, moving into the integration of biological data. Ensembl pages allow information annotated
on a genome to be shown alongside genes in one display.
This annotation comes from various sources and includes
sequence variation, conserved regions, motifs such as
CpG islands and sequences associated with regulatory
regions and promoters. DAS allows Ensembl to draw
together more information in more databases, displaying
data from external sources as an added layer of information. It also allows the biological community to display
and publish their data in an integrated framework. Furthermore, Ensembl itself is a DAS server, and other
browsers may display Ensembl data as a respective external source.

Figure 7 Variation information for rs2476601. A search for diabetes in the Ensembl main page shows 16,009 human variations associated with this
disease in the NHGRI GWAS catalogue. Searching for one of these, rs2476601, and then clicking on this hit, opens the variation tab for this SNP. The
phenotype data link at the left ([62]shown in the figure) reveals this variation is implicated in several diseases, including Rheumatoid Arthritis and
Crohn's Disease. Links to the GWAS catalogue entries are displayed along with studies in the PubMed database that show the associations. The risk
alleles for these diseases are not the same, revealing this position in the genome to be potentially highly important for function.

Figure 8 Region in detail for the rs2476601 locus. The region around rs2476601[63] is shown, with the non-synonymous SNPs in yellow. rs2476601
is circled, and it aligns with an exon found in two coding, and one non-coding, splice variants of the PTPN22 gene. Note that exons align well with
conserved regions, shown by the blocks in the constrained elements track (calculated from the whole genome alignments across 33 species). We can
see the deep evolutionary conservation of this region by displaying the human-chicken pairwise alignment (in pink at the bottom of the image),
which shows that this region of the genome is likely to be under strong evolutionary constraint throughout vertebrate evolution.

As demonstrated in the case studies outlined here,
experimentalists targeting potential functional regions
for a gene could use a quick display of a variety of
sequence features to form a basis for such predictions.
The whole genome alignments leading to comparison of
sequences across species can indicate important functional regions that are highly conserved. Regulatory features and associated motifs can be compared with these
conserved regions to direct researchers towards undiscovered, potentially functional sites.
