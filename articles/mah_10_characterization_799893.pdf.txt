element that modulates excretory cell
gene-expression in Caenorhabditis elegans

Abstract
Background: We have previously demonstrated that the POU transcription factor CEH-6 is required for driving
aqp-8 expression in the C. elegans excretory (canal) cell, an osmotic regulatory organ that is functionally analogous
to the kidney. This transcriptional regulation occurs through a CEH-6 binding to a cis-regulatory element called the
octamer (ATTTGCAT), which is located in the aqp-8 promoter.
Results: Here, we further characterize octamer driven transcription in C. elegans. First, we analyzed the positional
requirements of the octamer. To do so, we assayed the effects on excretory cell expression by placing the octamer
within the well-characterized promoter of vit-2. Second, using phylogenetic footprinting between three
Caenorhabditis species, we identified a set of 165 genes that contain conserved upstream octamers in their
promoters. Third, we used promoter::GFP fusions to examine the expression patterns of 107 of the 165 genes. This
analysis demonstrated that conservation of octamers in promoters increases the likelihood that the gene is
expressed in the excretory cell. Furthermore, we found that the sequences flanking the octamers may have
functional importance. Finally, we altered the octamer using site-directed mutagenesis. Thus, we demonstrated that
some nucleotide substitutions within the octamer do not affect the expression pattern of nearby genes, but
change their overall expression was changed. Therefore, we have expanded the core octamer to include flanking
regions and variants of the motif.
Conclusions: Taken together, we have demonstrated that octamer-containing regions are associated with
excretory cell expression of several genes that have putative roles in osmoregulation. Moreover, our analysis of the
octamer sequence and its sequence variants could aid in the identification of additional genes that are expressed
in the excretory cell and that may also be regulated by CEH-6.

Background
The Caenorhabditis elegans excretory system is composed of four cells: the excretory duct cell, the bi-nucleate excretory gland cell, the excretory pore cell, and the
excretory (canal) cell (EC). Each of these cells are descendents of the AB cell lineage [1]. The EC in particular
has a unique H-shaped structure consisting of two pairs
of bilaterally-symmetrical projections that protrude anteriorly and posteriorly from the central cell body. The EC
forms approximately 270 minutes after the first cellular
division near the centre of the embryo [2]. Subsequently,
two processes extend dorso-laterally, which then

bifurcate to form the anterior and posterior canal
branches. By the end of the first larval stage, the EC
canals have reached their full length relative to the
length of the nematode [3]. Further growth of the canals
is influenced by their attachment to the hypodermis,
which promotes extension of the EC canals following
the first larval stage [3]. Not surprisingly, because of
similarities in their structures, the EC and neurons share
many developmental cues that dictate elongation, guidance and outgrowth [4].
Even though the EC shares developmental cues with
neurons, it has a distinct function. The EC plays a role
in maintaining osmotic balance by collecting soluble
organic and inorganic metabolic waste substances and
expelling these to the environment [5]. For C. elegans,

osmoregulation is a critical function due to the continuous and unpredictable stresses placed upon worms in
their native soil habitat. To facilitate the exchange of
dissolved material, the fluid-filled EC arms are exposed
to pseudocoelomic fluid. The pseudocoelomic fluid in
turn is in contact with most of the cells in C. elegans,
presumably having a function analogous with circulatory
fluid. The pseudocoelomic fluid also provides the turgor
for the hydrostatic skeleton of C. elegans, which is
essential for locomotion. In addition to maintaining
osmotic balance, the excretory system is responsible for
secreting hormones [6] and fluids required for molting
[7]. Notably, the osmoregulatory function of the EC
resembles the role of the mammalian kidneys. Thus,
characterizing conserved mechanisms that govern EC
transcription may provide insight into regulatory circuits
that control kidney-specific transcription.
We are interested in the mechanisms that govern
transcriptional regulation in the EC of C. elegans. Our
laboratory has previously characterized two distinct
transcriptional regulatory mechanisms affecting EC gene
expression. One of these mechanisms relies upon binding of the transcriptional regulator DCP-66 to the Ex-1
cis-regulatory element (CCATACATTA). Together,
DCP-66 and Ex-1 drive EC-exclusive expression of pgp12, an ABC transporter-encoding gene [8]. However,
DCP-66 is a component of the transcriptional inhibitory
nucleosomal remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, which is typically associated with gene repression
[9]. The second mechanism, involves CEH-6, a class III
POU homeobox transcription factor (TF), which binds
to a cis-regulatory element called the octamer (ATTTGCAT) [10]. We originally characterized the octamer as
an element required for EC-expression of the aquaporin-encoding gene aqp-8. Of note, CEH-6 is also
expressed in the excretory cell (EC), thus fulfilling the
spatial requirements of a TF responsible for EC-selective
transcription. Additionally, CEH-6 is detected in the
bilaterally symmetric neurons (RMDDLR, RMDVLR,
AUALR and AVHLR), P.na cells (ventral nerve cord),
five rectal cells (B, Y, U, F and K) [11], two tail nerve
cells, ventral hypoderm, anterior body wall muscle, body
wall muscle cells, and intestine [12]. The broad expression of CEH-6 indicates that it likely regulates transcription in a several ectodermal cells as well.
Because CEH-6 interacts with the octamer to drive
aqp-8 expression in the EC, we wanted to determine
whether the octamer is generally linked to EC-expression. If so, octamer regulated genes could represent
novel candidates that function in the EC. Furthermore,
we also attempted to define the role of the octamer cisregulatory element as a driver of EC-selective transcription. Specifically, we determined whether the octamer is
under spatial restrictions within promoter regions,

identified genes that require the octamer for EC expression, and identified variants of the octamer that are able
to drive EC-expression. Thus, this work identified a set
of candidate genes that could be relevant to kidney
function in vertebrates. Overall, our data reinforce the
role of octamers and presumably their cognate transcription factors such as CEH-6 in directing osmoregulatory organ gene expression.

Results
The Location of the Octamer Sequence in the Promoter
can be Flexible

Previously, we found evidence that the octamer is spatially restricted in the aqp-8 promoter [10]. However,
we also determined that the octamer still had the capacity to drive EC-specific expression when placed in close
proximity to the ATG using the Δpes-10 minimal promoter [10] (note that we refer to the ATG because
many transcriptional start sites are poorly characterized
in C. elegans). Thus, we hypothesized that the octamer
might have different spatial restrictions in the promoter
regions of different genes. To assess spatial dependence
of the octamer within the promoter region, we used the
vit-2 promoter as a tool. vit-2 encodes a yolk protein
that is expressed at high levels in the intestine [13], but
is not normally expressed in the EC. A promoter
encompassing 247 bps directly upstream of the vit-2
ATG is sufficient for driving intestinal expression of vit2 [14]. Therefore, we used the intestinal expression to
assay for promoter function. We generated a series of
promoter constructs by appending tandem octamer
sequences to the 5’ end of vit-2 promoter truncation
constructs (258 bp to 700 bp upstream of the ATG)
(Figure 1A). These constructs were fused to GFP and
then injected into wild-type worms to generate transgenic nematodes. Subsequently, we monitored for GFP
expression in the intestine and in the EC.
We observed that the octamer was not able to drive
EC expression in constructs that contained less than
448 bp upstream of the vit-2 ATG. However, these constructs retained the ability to drive intestinal expression
indicating that the transgene was successfully generated
and functional (Figure 1B). Placing the octamer at the
5’-end of vit-2 promoter constructs larger than 448 bp
upstream of the ATG led to ectopic GFP expression in
the EC (Figure 1C). An exception to this was from a
transgene containing octamers 652 bp upstream of vit2’s ATG, which did not drive assayable levels of GFP.
This transgenic strain drove intestinal GFP, but failed to
drive GFP in the EC. The lack of EC-expression indicates that there may be a cis-linked element located
between 600 bp and 652 bp upstream of the vit-2 ATG
that represses EC expression. Alternatively, it is possible
that this transgene construct formed a concatemer

various lengths of vit-2 promoter fragment to assay the ability of the octamer to drive EC-expression at different places within promoters. A,

in vivo that is incompatible with the expression of the
GFP reporter. This second scenario is unlikely because
we did observe intestinal expression. In any case, these
data suggest that octamer function may be spatially
restricted in some promoters. Taken together, although
the above data did not allow us to conclude whether the
octamer has an optimal distance from the ATG for
influencing EC-expression, the data do suggest that
functional octamers can be present at various places in
different promoters.
Many EC-expressed Genes are not regulated by Octamers

Because functional octamers may be located at various
distances upstream of the ATG, we searched for genes
with upstream octamers within 1,200 bp upstream of
their ATGs; WormBase (WS195). Thus, we identified
1,340 candidate genes including promoters that contain
either the forward and/or the inverse of the octamer
(ATGCAAAT). To assess the function of these octamers, we selected genes from this set that are expressed
in the EC [14,15]. In addition, we assessed the function
of the octamer in the promoters of hlh-8 and ZC395.10,
genes with no known EC-expression. For these

seventeen genes, we tested if regions containing the
octamer are required for EC-expression by truncating
the promoter from the 5’-end and observing whether
the octamer regions affect the level of EC expression
(Additional file 1). However, we could not conclude
whether the octamers were functional in promoters of
Y69E1A.6, F36H1.2, Y48A6B.8, F29F11.6, B0334.4,
C02B8.6, H23N18.3, R13F6.3, and, Y53G8AR.3 because
EC expression was lost in worms carrying promoter
constructs that still had the octamer, suggesting that
there are other cis-linked elements that drive EC-expression of these genes (Additional file 1). Amongst the
other eight genes, our promoter truncation analysis
revealed three genes that are likely dependent upon the
octamer containing region for EC expression: ZC395.10,
C01B12.3, and hlh-8/C02B8.4. These results are not surprising as previous reports indicate that 12% of ECexpressed genes are predicted to be regulated by the
DCP-66/Ex-1 mechanism [8] Additionally, the nuclear
hormone receptor NHR-31 regulates most of the vacuolar ATPase (vATPase) components in the EC [16] pointing to multiple regulatory mechanisms that specify ECexpression.

The octamer in ZC395.10’s promoter region is located
120 bp upstream of the ATG. ZC395.10 is localized to
most neurons, intestine, pharynx, and vulva [14,15].
However, a ZC395.10 promoter construct containing the
octamer (5’-end 135 bp upstream of the ATG and in the
forward orientation) drove expression in a different pattern than the original longer promoter. In this shorter
promoter construct, we observed GFP in the EC, anterior neurons, intestine, and rectal epithelia (Figure 2A).
The differences between this and the construct with the
larger promoter indicate that there is a cis-linked repressor element(s) that modulates EC and rectal epithelial
tissue expression in ZC395.10’s promoter. Interestingly,
the EC and rectal epithelia expression pattern resulting
from the shorter construct overlaps with CEH-6’s
expression pattern [3]. Furthermore, deleting the octamer containing region leads to loss of expression in
both the EC and rectal epithelia. Additionally, there
must be an independent transcriptional regulatory
mechanism that drives ZC395.10 expression in anterior
neurons and the intestine (Figure 2B).
An octamer is located 1,055 bp upstream of the ATG
in C01B12.3’s promoter region. A transcriptional reporter
construct with a 5’-end 2,853 bp upstream of the ATG
leads to expression in the EC (Figure 2C), hypoderm,

Page 4 of 13

spermatheca, and the anal depressor muscle [14,15].
However, the EC-expression level is greatly decreased
when the promoter is truncated (879 bp upstream of the
ATG) corresponding to removal of a large portion of the
promoter and including an octamer (Figure 2D). Interestingly, the orthologs of C01B12.3 in C. briggsae and C.
remanei also have octamers in their promoters. Moreover, the distance of the octamers from the ATG are
similar (1,108 bp and 1,100 bp upstream of the ATG
respectively), suggesting that this element might also regulate EC-expression of C01B12.3 orthologs.
The hlh-8 promoter contains an octamer located 582
bp upstream of the ATG. It was previously shown that
hlh-8 is expressed in the intestine, anterior neurons, and
vulva [14,15]. A 5’ truncation that limits the promoter
to only seven bases upstream of the octamer (589 bp
upstream of the ATG) results in expression localized to
the EC and the second pharyngeal bulb (Figure 2E).
This change in expression pattern indicates the likely
presence of a repressor element(s) that blocks EC and
pharyngeal expression. Expression of hlh-8 in the EC is
completely abolished upon deletion of the octamer-containing fragment. In sum, our promoter deletion analysis
identified octamer-containing promoter regions required
for the EC-specific expression for the above three genes.

Conserved Octamer sequences in Promoter Regions
Strongly Bias for EC Expression

Due to the low success rate in finding octamer containing regions associated with EC-expression with the
above approach (only 3/17), we turned to phylogenetic
footprinting. Using this comparative method, we identified promoters with perfectly conserved octamers
between three closely related Caenorhabditis species (C.
elegans, C. briggsae, and C. remanei). This resulted in
the identification of 165 promoters that contain conserved octamers (Additional file 2).
Of the 165 genes, nineteen genes had previously characterized expression patterns [14,15]. To obtain a larger
sample size, we analyzed the expression patterns of an
additional 88 candidates (Additional file 3). From these
107 promoters, we identified 64 that could drive detectable levels of GFP expression, including 25 (39%) that
were EC-expressed. This represents a significant enrichment of genes expressed in the EC when compared to a
control dataset of 1,885 expression patterns, within
which only 10.2% (193/1,885) of all genes are expressed
in the EC [14,15]. Strikingly, twelve genes (19%) in our
set were expressed only in the EC. This is a vast enrichment over the control set which contains only 0.3% (6/
1,885) genes with EC-exclusive expression [14,15] (significance P < 0.01 as determined by 1-tailed Z-test).
Next we wanted to determine whether their ECexpression was dependent on the octamer containing
fragments. Using the same approach as in the previous
section (5’ serial promoter truncations), we selected 21
promoters that drove EC expression for further analysis
(Additional file 4). From this set, we identified four
genes that are completely dependent on fragments containing the octamer for EC expression (M176.5, aqp-8/
K02G10.7, twk-36/R12G8.2), C05D12.1) and two genes
that exhibit reduced EC expression upon deletion of the
octamer region (R02F2.8, and F16F9.1) (Additional file 4;

Page 5 of 13

Figure 3) (note: the aqp-8 promoter was identified in the
phylogenetic analysis, but was not subject to truncation
analysis as it’s octamer has been previously characterized
[10]).
Sequences Flanking Functional Octamers are
Likely Conserved

In the experiments described above, we identified genes
that may depend on the octamer for expression in the
EC. Thus, we used these promoters to study whether
the sequences flanking the octamer are conserved. We
aligned the nine octamer sequences along with 15 bp of
upstream and downstream flanking sequences. The
resulting alignments were displayed using WebLogo [17]
(Figure 4; note that the reverse complementary sequence
was used if the octamer was inverted). This analysis
revealed that, in general, octamers are flanked by ATrich regions. More specifically, regions upstream of the
octamer are biased towards being A/C-rich and downstream regions tend to be T-rich. Thus, our newly identified collection of EC-expressed genes has allowed us to
define additional specificity determinants related to the
octamer.
Intra-octamer Nucleotide Substitutions Have Different
Effects on EC Expression

Previously, we observed that the octamer is perfectly
conserved within the promoters of aqp-8 orthologs
among five Caenorhabditis species [10]. Therefore, we
hypothesized that the octamer sequence must be absolutely conserved to drive EC-specific expression. To
examine the octamer in more detail, we manipulated its
sequence using site-directed mutagenesis. We generated
variants of the octamer by targeting nucleotides -264 bp
and -263 bp of the octamer in the aqp-8 promoter (bold
residues ATTTGCAT). Every possible single-nucleotide
substitution and a dual nucleotide substitution were

Figure 3 The level of EC expression is decreased upon loss of the octamer in the region upstream of C05D12.1. The octamer is located
205 bp upstream of the ATG of C05D12.1. Loss of the octamer leads to a decrease in the GFP expression level. A, A -247 bp 5’ truncation leads
strong expression localized to the EC. B, A -141 bp 5’ truncation leads to a lower level of expression, but still localized to the EC.

Figure 4 Alignment of octamer and flanking regions of octamers responsible for EC expression reveals that flanking residues are A-T

tested at these sites. The mutated constructs were fused
to GFP to visualize changes in EC-expression. The 5’end of every construct was defined as 276 bp upstream
of the aqp-8’s ATG because truncation constructs ranging between 1.6 kb to 272 bp upstream of aqp-8’s
ATG provide consistent EC-specific expression patterns
[10]. Also, because the aqp-8 promoter produces consistent levels of EC expression, our reference transgene
construct is a 1.6 kb aqp-8 promoter region fused to
GFP (Figure 5A) [10].
At -264 bp, a G®A residue change (aqp-8 promoter
(-264G®A)
::GFP) did not alter the expression level or pattern (Figure 5B). However, a G®T change (aqp-8promoter
(-264G®T)
::GFP led to a significant decrease in the EC
expression level (Figure 5C). A G®C substitution (aqp8 promoter(-264G®C) ::GFP) led to a complete loss of ECexpression. At -263 bp, a C®A residue substitution in
aqp-8promoter(-263C®A)::GFP led to decreased EC-expression (Figure 5D). The C®G and C®T substitutions
(aqp-8promoter(-263C®G)::GFP and aqp-8promoter(-263C®T)::
GFP) both led to a complete losses of GFP expression.
Finally, replacing the GC pair at -264 with an AG pair
(aqp-8 promoter(-264GC®AG) ::GFP) led to decreased ECexpression (Figure 5E). In all constructs, the GFP signal
remained localized to the EC suggesting that some octamer sequence variants have the capacity to influence EC
expression.

Discussion
In this study, we demonstrate that octamer containing
regions are involved in driving EC-expression of several
genes. This builds upon our previous data demonstrating that aqp-8 is dependent upon the POU homeobox
TF CEH-6 and the octamer for EC-expression [10]. In
several nematodes, the position of the octamer relative
to the ATG is fairly well conserved among aqp-8 orthologs [10]. This is interesting as some cis-regulatory elements are spatially restricted within promoters. For

example, in C. elegans functional X-box motifs cluster
roughly 100 bp upstream of ATGs to drive neuronal
expression [18]. Likewise, the GC-box cis-regulatory element has an optimal distance in relation to the TATA
box. Moving the GC-box away from its optimal distance
leads to decreased expression levels of nearby genes
even though its cognate TF, Sp1, still bind with similar
affinities [19]. In addition to spatial restriction relative
to ATGs, relative positioning between cis-regulatory elements within the same promoter can affect expression.
For instance, the b-actin promoter contains the socalled CCAAT and CCArGG boxes. These regulatory
elements are binding sites for the TFs nuclear factor Y
(NF-Y) and serum response factor (SRF), respectively.
Manipulating the intra-element distance between these
two cis-regulatory sequences accordingly affects b-actin
message levels [20]. However, in the present study we
had also observed that the octamer could be placed at
different positions in a heterologous promoter and still
drive EC-specific expression. Therefore, unlike the
above examples, the octamer does not appear to be as
spatially restricted within promoter although there still
might be some tight limitations to octamer location.
In this study, we used different strategies to identify
novel genes that require upstream octamer containing
regions for expression in the EC. First, we identified
genes with octamer sequences in their promoters. Using
this strategy we identified a small number of genes that
are modulated by upstream octamer-containing fragments. Secondly, we used a more stringent approach to
identify octamers by relying on interspecies conservation. We discovered that the expression patterns of
genes in this filtered promoter set had a higher than
expected incidence of EC-expression. In these two
screens, we identified nine genes that are likely octamermodulated. Several of these genes likely have osmoregulatory functions, agreeing with the notion the EC is analogous to the kidney. In general, the genes we identified

fell into four categories: transmembrane channels/pores,
Hsp90 co-chaperones, proteins with unknown functions,
and TFs.
The largest group of genes encodes transmembrane
channels/pores, indicating that many genes regulated by
the octamer participate in substrate transport. The five
channels/pores are:
1) twk-36 encodes a C. elegans TWIK potassium ion
channel protein. In vertebrates, TWIKs are commonly
expressed in neuronal tissues and, to a lesser extent in
lungs, skeletal muscle [21], and tubular portions of the
kidney (proximal tubule, ascending limbs, distal convoluted tubules, and medullary collecting duct) [22]. The
mammalian TWIK, TASK, is sensitive to changes in
extracellular pH, indicating that some of these proteins
have roles in modulating cellular responses to pH flux
[23]. Also, because their conductance is osmotically
regulated, TWIKs can influence cellular volume [24].
The C. elegans genome has 42 twk genes. As in other
organisms, most of the C. elegans twks are expressed in

neurons [25]; however, twk-36 is the only twk expressed
in the EC [25]. Interestingly, another group has demonstrated that twk-36 is directly regulated by CEH-6 [26].
This independent study strengthens the notion CEH-6
is a bona fide regulator of EC expression that likely acts
through the octamer in the promoter of twk-36. Therefore, it is possible that CEH-6 regulation impacts at
least some of the octamer-dependent candidates identified here.
2) aqp-8, an aquaporin whose function and regulation
have been characterized previously [10,27].
3) C05D12.1 is a homolog of the cytochrome b561/
ferric reductase SDR-2. In mammals, SDR-2 is expressed
in the brain [28] and kidney where it aids in iron reabsorption via the accessory transporter, divalent-cation
transporter 1 (DCT-1) [29]. Cytochrome b561 proteins
transport electrons in an ascorbate-dependent manner.
Due to the role of SDR-2 in ascorbate regeneration,
C05D12.1 could be involved in vitamin C homeostasis
and/or oxidative stress responses.

4) R02F2.8 encodes a solute carrier (SLC) protein that
is most similar to the mammalian SLC36 subfamily.
SLC36 proteins are localized to intracellular and plasma
membranes [30] where they function as symporters.
SLC36 proteins transport small neutral amino acids
such as glycine, alanine, and proline. Because SLC36
proteins affect proton flux, they also contribute to intracellular pH homeostasis [30]. In mammals there are
four SLC36 genes, two of which are expressed in the
kidney (SLC36A1 and SLC36A2) [31].
5) C01B12.3 encodes a C. elegans Bestrophin 3 homolog. Bestrophins are transmembrane proteins that modulate calcium dependent transport of chloride ions across
cellular membranes. Bestrophins are enriched in the
plasma membranes of epithelial cells where they manage
cellular volume [32]. Bestrophins are also expressed in
exocrine gland tissues (e.g. pancreas, lacrimal and salivary
glands), lung, testis and kidney [33]. In these tissues they
facilitate trans-epithelial movement of chloride ions leading to water and electrolyte movement [33].
In addition to transmembrane channels and pores, we
uncovered several other genes that have less obvious
links to osmoregulation and kidney biology. One of
these, ZC395.10, is homologous to thehighly conserved
Hsp90 co-chaperone protein, p23. p23 interactions with
Hsp90 to ensure the proper folding and maturation of
many proteins including steroid receptors [34], telomerase [35], and proteins that are upregulated in cancers
[36]. We also identified M176.5, a gene with little prior
functional data. M176.5 is a nematode-specific gene that
is mainly composed of hydrophobic amino acids and is
therefore likely to be localized to cell membranes and/or
forms a globular protein.
Finally, we identified two TFs. The first, F16F9.1 is a
homolog of the mammalian protein lipopolysaccharideinduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor (LITAF; a.k.a.
SIMPLE/Small Integral Membrane Protein of Lysosome/
Late Endosome) [37]. LITAF is linked to Charcot-MarieTooth (CMT1C) disease, a heritable neuropathy characterized by loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation [38].
In CMT1C, LITAF is implicated in protein degradation
[39]. LITAF also functions in cytokine production [40].
We speculate that because F16F9.1 is expressed in the
EC, a tissue exposed to the environment, it could be
involved in innate immune responses. Also, because C.
elegans F16F9.1 is expressed in neurons, it is possible
that the nematode could act as a model for CMT1C.
The other TF we identified is hlh-8, a helix-loop-helix
TF related to human TWIST. TWIST was originally
characterized in Drosophila as a gene involved in dorsalventral patterning [41]. TWIST TFs bind E-box cis-regulatory elements. In C. elegans, HLH-8 is important for
regulating muscle, intestinal and anal muscle development. Consequently hlh-8 mutants exhibit defecation

Page 8 of 13

and egg-laying defects [42]. Several transcriptional targets of HLH-8 are known, including cdh-4, egl-15,
C18B12.6, F08D12.7, rbc-1, npr-10, dhs-5, sgcb-1, erv-46,
M60.6, R02E4.1, rev-1, and myo-3 [43]. Most of these
genes are unlikely to be transcriptional targets of HLH8 in the EC as they are not expressed in this cell. An
exception is cdh-4 [14,15], which encodes a widely
expressed cadherin, which is also expressed in the EC.
Due to the limited number of HLH-8 targets in the EC,
we can envisage a model where CEH-6 plays a role in
directing the precise transcriptional outcomes of downstream TFs (e.g. hlh-8). In this role, CEH-6 could modulate target genes (e.g. cdh-4) specifically in a subset of
ectodermal tissues including the EC.
Several of the genes that depend on their upstream
octamer containing fragments for EC expression are
also expressed in additional tissues. An interesting consequence of assaying the activity of truncated promoters
is that loss of the octamer containing fragment sometimes led to loss of expression in multiple tissues
including neurons as indicated in the cases of ZC395.10,
twk-36, M176.5, and F16F9.1 (Additional file 4). This is
not surprising as vertebrate orthologs of CEH-6 including Brn1 are involved in neuronal and kidney development [44,45].
Our strategy for studying the above genes involved
comparing the expression patterns resulting from promoter truncations that either contain or remove the
octamer. Analyzing promoter function by means of
these truncations imposes some significant drawbacks;
for example, we could not address the function of several candidate octamer elements because removing
regions upstream of the octamer led to loss of EC
expression. Also, because our promoter truncations
deleted the octamer and some flanking regions, we cannot be certain that loss of EC-selective expression is the
consequence of removing the octamer. However,
because the 5’ ends of the truncations were in general
fairly close to the octamer, and because loss of ECexpression correlated with octamer deletion, we believe
that these genes are likely dependent on octamers for
their expression in the EC. To address the issue of
whether these are indeed functional octamers, one could
introduce point mutations within the octamer and assess
the resulting consequences on EC-expression. However,
we demonstrated in our mutagenesis experiments that
certain point mutations are not sufficient to abolish EC
expression in the context of the aqp-8 promoter.
Another potential drawback from our approach is the
fact that much of our study is based on expression patterns arising from transgenic C. elegans strains containing extrachromosomal arrays. Such arrays are
susceptible to somatic transgene loss, which results in
mosaic reporter expression. This mosaiscism has the

Mah et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2010, 11:19
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/11/19

potential to confound our analysis by under-representing the expression pattern. However, expression patterns
resulting from genome-integrated transgenes (aqp-8promoter
::GFP) are identical to the expression patterns in
aqp-8promoter::GFP strains carrying extrachromosomal
transgenes. Therefore, mosaic loss of the extrachromosomal transgene array is not likely an issue for analyzing
changes in EC expression. Despite the potential shortcomings detailed above, our study revealed a set of
genes whose expression likely depends on the octamer
for expression in the EC; these genes are excellent CEH6 candidate targets. In agreement with this notion, twk23, one of the genes that we identified as dependent on
an upstream octamer fragement, has been demonstrated,
independently, to be regulated by CEH-6 [26].
Because our bioinformatic search did not bias the
direction of the octamer, we discovered promoters in
the forward and inverted orientation can be associated
with EC-expression. Octamers in a forward orientation
occur in the promoters of aqp-8, M176.5, twk-36,
ZC395.10, hlh-8, C01B12.3, and C05D12.1, whereas
inverted octamers are present in the promoters of
F16F9.4 and R02F2.8. Although we could not determine from our small sample set whether the direction
of the octamer has a functional consequence, there
are possible implications related to direction of the
octamer sequence. For example, octamers upstream of
immunoglobulin light and heavy chain genes have
directional preferences (ATGCAAAT and ATTTGCAT respectively) [46]. In addition, the human POU
homeobox gene Oct1 is auto-regulated by two
upstream octamers, which are also situated in inverted
orientations. Although each site binds Oct1 with equal
affinity, each of these sites has different effects on
Oct1 expression [47].
It appears that transcriptional auto-regulation is a
common mode of regulation among POU TFs [47-49].
Interestingly, we detected an octamer upstream of ceh6’s ATG in C. elegans. Likewise, there is an octamer
located in the regulatory region of the C. briggsae gene
encoding a putative CEH-6 ortholog, providing evidence
that auto-regulation might be conserved. However, these
octamer are located within a predicted non-coding RNA
gene (class RNAz) [50]. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to determine whether CEH-6, like other POU
TFs is auto-regulated.
With our set of nine candidate octamers, we had the
opportunity to determine whether residues flanking the
element are conserved. Globally, the G/C content of C.
elegans is 31% [51]. However, the regions flanking the
octamers-associated with EC-expression contain a
slightly higher G/C content (38%). Our alignments of
these octamers revealed that despite the higher G/C
content, some positions have preferences for A/T

Page 9 of 13

residues. Strikingly, directly 3’ to the octamer, an A or T
is always present. The conservation of this residue is
consistent with the results of a previous study, which
identified Oct1 binding preferences using a Systematic
Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Environment
(SELEX)-based in vitro binding approach [52]. Because
of the enriched G/C content in octamer adjacent
regions, it is likely that the observed preference for A/T
at certain positions have relevance.
We tested the effects of targeted-octamer mutations
on EC-expression. We found that several single-base
substitutions did not affect the cis-regulatory element’s
ability to drive expression in the EC. Interestingly, we
did not observe a change in expression level or pattern
when position five of the octamer was mutated from a
purine to purine (ATTTGCAT®ATTTACAT). This
variant of the octamer was demonstrated to be a binding site for the catfish class III POU TF, Oct2 [53].
Therefore, this residue change results in an octamer
variant which retains the ability to interact with the
POUS sub-domain binding consensus sequence (TG(C/
A)ATattc) [54]. At the same residue position, a thymine replacement (ATTTGCAT®ATTTTCAT), led to
weak GFP expression also restricted to the EC. This
sequence was able to bind to Oct1 in vitro in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) [55]. However,
in another study this variant of the octamer was not
able to drive reporter expression in human cells [56].
These results, taken together, indicate that this motif
variant is a sub-optimal POU TF binding site that can
drive weak EC expression in C. elegans. A mutation at
the sixth residue (ATTTGCAT®ATTTGAAT) also
led to weak EC-localized expression [10]. This octamer
variant is functional in the promoter of the Drosophila
gene, Choline Acetyltransferase (ChAT). In the ChAT
promoter, ATTTGAAT interacts with the POU
homeobox TF, dPOU-19 [57]. All other single nucleotide substitutions at these two locations led to loss of
GFP expression. However, a double residue replacement of these residues (ATTTGCAT®ATTTAGAT)
could still drive expression, as indicated by weak GFP
expression in the EC. There have been no previous
reports of this dual nucleotide substitution variant
associating with POU TFs and it is therefore a novel
POU TF binding site variant. Overall, our mutagenesis
assays indicate that the octamer cis-regulatory element
could have a range of functional variants in C. elegans.
Thus, identifying and characterizing promoters containing these octamer variants may reveal a larger
group genes expressed in the EC.
Because variants of the octamer can influence ECexpression, we examined the pgp-12 promoter region in
C. elegans more closely. Previously, it was demonstrated
that pgp-12 expression is regulated by DCP-66/Ex-1 [8].

Mah et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2010, 11:19
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/11/19

In this report, the TF/cis-regulatory element interaction
was confirmed using in vitro and genetic approaches.
Loss of either Ex-1 (located 238 bp upstream pgp-12’s
ATG) or DCP-66 resulted in loss of EC expression [1].
We detected an octamer like sequence (ATTTCCAT)
that partially overlaps the Ex-1 (-241 bp). We also identified this octamer-like sequence in the orthologous
regions of C. briggsae. Using the Transcriptional Element Search System (TESS) [58] to identify predicted
cis-regulatory elements, we found that the octamer-like
sequence is indeed a potential target for octamer binding proteins. Additionally this sequence binds Oct1 in
vitro [52]. In fact, Zhao et al. reported that promoter
constructs encompassing Ex-1 at -241 bp results in
strong reporter expression during all developmental
stages [8]. They also studied the expression pattern
resulting from a promoter region defined by a 5’-end
238 bp upstream of the ATG, thereby removing three
nucleotides from the octamer-like sequence. Although
this promoter still drove EC-expression, the intensity of
the GFP reporter was greatly decreased in adult and larval worms. Additionally, embryonic expression was
almost eliminated. Finally, a construct with a 5’-end 228
bp upstream of the ATG was not able to drive expression of GFP indicating the necessity of the Ex-1 (and
the octamer-like sequence) for EC expression. Therefore, not only did this prior study define the role of the
Ex-1 for EC-expression, but it also indirectly provided
evidence that the octamer upstream of pgp-12 might
affect EC-expression. This suggests that the DCP-66/Ex1 and the octamer-directed transcriptional regulatory
mechanisms co-operatively modulate the expression of
pgp-12 in the EC. This model of concerted and redundant regulation of EC-expression may have relevance in
other genes including, possibly, several genes within our
phylogenetically defined candidate set.

Conclusions
Overall, we determined that the octamer is likely
responsible for the expression of several genes within
the EC, an osmoregulatory organ analogous to the kidney. Because one of our candidate genes, twk-36, has
been demonstrated to be a bona fide target of CEH-6
regulation, it would be interesting to determine whether
CEH-6 is involved in the regulation of four other candidates. Although our candidates, for the most part, were
chosen based upon perfect conservation of the octamer,
we determined that several variants of the octamer can
drive EC-expression. The existence of functional octamer variants indicates that future searches for octamerdriven genes should use a loosely defined octamer
sequence. Overall, understanding conserved mechanisms
of gene regulation that determine appropriate EC
expression may provide insight into underlying

Page 10 of 13

transcriptional mechanisms that regulate transcription
in analogous organs including the kidney.

Methods
Nematode strains and maintenance

C. elegans strains were maintained at 20°C on nematode
growth media (NGM) plates inoculated with E. coli
OP50. All manipulations were conducted using standard
procedures [59]. For the list of promoter::reporter constructs used in this study, refer to Additional file 5.
Generation of transgene constructs and strains

DNA constructs were generated using fusion PCR as
previously described [60]. Promoter-containing
sequences were fused upstream of the GFP-coding
region in the pPD95.67 GFP-coding cassette. The octamer::vit-2promoter::GFP chimeric constructs were generated by PCR as follows. The forward PCR primers
contain three tandem repeats of the octamer at the 5’
end of a vit-2-promoterspecific sequence. The right primer of the vit-2 chimeric promoter constructs remained
consistent between strains (vit2reverse -AGT CGA CCT
GCA GGC ATG CAA GCT CGA CCT GAT GGC
TGA ACC G). The chimeric promoters were fused to
the GFP-coding region in the pPD95.67. The mutagenized octamer constructs were generated by substituting
target nucleotides in the forward PCR primer.
All C. elegans microinjections were conducted on
either an Olympus BH2-HLSH or a Zeiss 47 3016 invert
microscope. The PCR constructs were injected into the
syncitial region of the gonad. The final concentrations
of the injection mix are 30 ng/μl of the target construct
along with 100 ng/μl of the marker construct, pCeh361
(dpy-5(+)) [61], into the target strain dpy-5(e907)
(CB907). Transgenic F1s (Dpy-5 rescued) were individually plated. Wild type F2 lines were selected to establish
the transgenic lines. When available, we analyzed a second independently segregating transgenic line.
Identification of all C. elegans genes with upstream
octamers

All genes containing an octamer (ATTTGCAT or ATGCAAAT) within 1,200 bp upstream of a protein-coding
gene in C. elegans were identified in WormBase, WS195.
Identification of all genes with interspecies conserved
upstream octamer

1,000 bp upstream of the ATG of all orthologous gene
groups in the nematodes:C. elegans, C. briggsae, and C.
remanei (WormBase WS195), were searched for the presence of octamers. A C. elegans promoter was considered if its C. briggsae and C. remanei counterparts both
contain one or more upstream octamers. Sequences
flanking the ATGs from these three Caenorhabditis

species and the predicated motifs were loaded into a
MySQL database using the GFF3 format http://www.
sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml. The comparative analysis was performed in programs written in Perl. We
used the Bio::DB::GFF Perl module [62].
Microscopy

All GFP-expression analyses were conducted on a Zeiss
Axioscope equipped with a QImaging camera and the
appropriate GFP optical filter sets. Worms were immobilized with 100 mM sodium azide (in water) immediately prior to imaging. All images were captured at
400× with identical camera and fluorescence settings
for all images (exposure times are indicated in the Figures) using QCapture software. The GFP images from
each transgenic strain are representative of their
populations.
Additional file 1: 5’ deletion of regions containing upstream
octamers. Promoter regions that caused EC-expression were truncated
in a 5’-manner. The constructs were either truncated in an octamertargeted manner or in an unbiased manner. The 5’ ends of the PCR
primer and octamer locations are relative to the genes’ ATGs. The stages
of expression are designated as E: embryonic, L: larval, and A: adult. The
