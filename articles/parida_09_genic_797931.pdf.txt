Abstract
Background: Completely sequenced plant genomes provide scope for designing a large number of
microsatellite markers, which are useful in various aspects of crop breeding and genetic analysis. With the
objective of developing genic but non-coding microsatellite (GNMS) markers for the rice (Oryza sativa L.)
genome, we characterized the frequency and relative distribution of microsatellite repeat-motifs in 18,935
predicted protein coding genes including 14,308 putative promoter sequences.
Results: We identified 19,555 perfect GNMS repeats with densities ranging from 306.7/Mb in
chromosome 1 to 450/Mb in chromosome 12 with an average of 357.5 GNMS per Mb. The average
microsatellite density was maximum in the 5' untranslated regions (UTRs) followed by those in introns,
promoters, 3'UTRs and minimum in the coding sequences (CDS). Primers were designed for 17,966 (92%)
GNMS repeats, including 4,288 (94%) hypervariable class I types, which were bin-mapped on the rice
genome. The GNMS markers were most polymorphic in the intronic region (73.3%) followed by markers
in the promoter region (53.3%) and least in the CDS (26.6%). The robust polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification efficiency and high polymorphic potential of GNMS markers over genic coding and random
genomic microsatellite markers suggest their immediate use in efficient genotyping applications in rice. A
set of these markers could assess genetic diversity and establish phylogenetic relationships among
domesticated rice cultivar groups. We also demonstrated the usefulness of orthologous and paralogous
conserved non-coding microsatellite (CNMS) markers, identified in the putative rice promoter sequences,
for comparative physical mapping and understanding of evolutionary and gene regulatory complexities
among rice and other members of the grass family. The divergence between long-grained aromatics and
subspecies japonica was estimated to be more recent (0.004 Mya) compared to short-grained aromatics
from japonica (0.006 Mya) and long-grained aromatics from subspecies indica (0.014 Mya).
Conclusion: Our analyses showed that GNMS markers with their high polymorphic potential would be
preferred candidate functional markers in various marker-based applications in rice genetics, genomics and
breeding. The CNMS markers provided encouraging implications for their use in comparative genome
mapping and understanding of evolutionary complexities in rice and other members of grass family.

Background
Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats are tandemly
repeated 1–6 base-pair (bp) nucleotide motifs distributed
across the genome in many prokaryotes and eukaryotes
[1]. An increasing number of microsatellites have been
characterized in protein coding sequences (CDSs) and
non-coding untranslated regions (UTRs) of genes for several plant species. Alterations in these microsatellite
sequences are thought to have significant consequences
with regard to gene function [2]. Variation in the length of
microsatellite motifs in non-coding sequences of genes
(i.e. promoters, UTRs and introns) may affect the process
of transcription and translation through slippage, gene
silencing and pre-mRNA splicing as has been observed for
many diseases in humans, including cancers and neuronal
disorders [3-9]. Microsatellite markers based on such
sequence motifs would be useful as "functional genetic
markers" for various applications in genomics and crop
breeding. However, the identification and characterization of such microsatellites has been limited in plants.
Completely sequenced genomes provide scope for designing a large number of gene based microsatellite markers.
Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is the first cereal with a completely
sequenced genome that has enabled the development of a
large number of microsatellite markers [10]. Recently,
Zhang et al. [11] developed 52,485 microsatellite markers
polymorphic between indica and japonica. It is difficult to
choose useful and informative microsatellite markers
from large marker data-sets for genotyping applications in
rice. This can be overcome by constructing a smaller
informative microsatellite marker database comprising
markers located in potentially functional genic sequences
with relatively high polymorphic potential. However,
genic microsatellite markers when derived from proteincoding sequences are constrained by purifying selection
[12] and thus have less potential for revealing polymorphism particularly at the intra-specific level [13]. In contrast, markers derived from non-coding sequence
components (i.e. 5'UTRs, introns and 3'UTRs) are under
moderate selection pressure and thus expected to be more
polymorphic as genetic markers. Previous studies have
shown non-random and distinct patterns of microsatellite
distribution in non-coding sequence components of rice
genes predicted in the completely sequenced rice genome
[14]. In view of the excellent genetic attributes and higher
informativeness expected for genic non-coding microsatellite (GNMS) markers, development of such markers
from the protein coding genes predicted in the rice
genome would be of practical significance.
A comparative analysis of non-coding sequences, known
as phylogenetic footprinting [15-19], has provided useful
inferences about conserved non-coding microsatellite
(CNMS) repeat-containing regulatory sequence elements

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/140

and their significance in gene regulation in plant-specific
pathways [20]. These studies have suggested the use of
completely finished and recently annotated rice genomic
sequences for intra- and inter-genomic phylogenetic footprinting to detect a large number of paralogous and
orthologous CNMS motifs, respectively, in the 5' noncoding promoter regions of genes among cereals and Arabidopsis thaliana. Identification of such CNMS motifs
would help in understanding the pattern of regulatory or
non-coding promoter sequence evolution in plant
genomes.
We undertook this study to characterize the frequency and
relative distribution of GNMS repeat-motifs in different
sequence components of protein coding rice genes; design
primers flanking the GNMS repeat-motifs; physically
locate the markers on rice chromosomes, and evaluate
their efficiency in the assessment of molecular diversity;
detect and characterize CNMS motifs in the putative promoter regions of rice genes using intra- and inter-genomic
phylogenetic footprinting; and evaluate markers for their
utility in comparative physical mapping and establishing
molecular phylogenetic relationships among different rice
cultivar groups.

Results and discussion
Frequency and relative abundance of GNMS
We identified 19,555 perfect GNMS (excluding mononucleotides) in 18,935 protein coding genes including
14,308 putative promoter sequences predicted in the rice
genome. The density of perfect GNMS varied from 306.7/
Mb in chromosome 1 to 450/Mb in chromosome 12 with
an average of 356.7 GNMS/Mb (Table 1). This included
4,657 (32.5%) GNMS repeats in putative promoters,
4,843 (25.6%) in 5'UTRs, 8,996 (12.8%) in introns and
1,020 (5.4%) in 3'UTRs (Table 1). Of the promoterderived GNMS repeats, 342 (16.6%) were found in 2,060
TATA box containing promoter sequences. The average
density of compound GNMS in the rice genes was 78.3/
Mb with maximum density (99.8/Mb) in chromosome 12
and minimum density (68.5/Mb) in chromosome 4. The
perfect GNMS density in the promoters was maximum
(388/Mb) in chromosome 3 and minimum (249.5/Mb)
in chromosome 11, whereas in the 5'UTRs it varied from
816.1/Mb in chromosome 11 to 1360/Mb in chromosome 8 (see Additional file 1). The intronic GNMS density
was maximum (514.5/Mb) in chromosome 11 and minimum (237/Mb) in chromosome 3, while in the 3'UTRs
the GNMS density ranged from 96/Mb in chromosome 4
to 168.3/Mb in chromosome 12. The average microsatellite density was maximum (1144.8/Mb) in the 5'UTRs followed by introns (327.3/Mb), promoters (300.8/Mb) and
3'UTRs (135.9/Mb) compared to 182.4/Mb in the CDS
(Table 1). Thus, the overall GNMS density increased gradually from the upstream of the transcription start sites

(TSS) and reached a peak (about 3.8 times higher than the
GNMS density in the promoters) in the downstream of
the TSS (i.e. 5'UTRs). Subsequently, the density decreased
and dropped down in the coding region and showed
asymmetrical distribution along the direction of transcription. However, this asymmetry arose because of high
GNMS density in the introns; about 1.8 and 2.4 times
higher than that in the CDS and 3'UTRs, respectively. Our
results are in contrast to an earlier report from Fujimori et
al. [21], which suggested gradual lowering of microsatellite density along the direction of transcription based on
the analyses of 28,469 full-length cDNA sequences. This

may be because we used annotated rice gene sets having
UTRs, introns and promoter sequences predicted from the
completely sequenced rice genome that provided a better
evaluation of GNMS density in the different sequence
components studied. The most frequent occurrence of
GNMS motifs in the 5'UTRs is consistent with earlier
observations in rice and Arabidopsis genomes [14]. Interestingly, the majority (57.6%) of the GNMS motifs in the
5'UTRs were present in various transcription- and translation-related genes encoding transcription/translation initiation and elongation factors and ribosomal proteins.
This suggests a functional significance of the repeat motifs

present in the 5' UTRs, which needs to be further investigated.
Nature and distribution of GNMS
The GC-rich trinucleotide GNMS repeat-motifs were the
most prevalent class of microsatellites in the regulatory
regions (i.e. 5'UTRs and promoters), whereas the AT-rich
trinucleotide repeats were distributed evenly in all the
coding and non-coding sequence components. However,
the proportion of GC-rich trinucleotide motifs was maximum in the 5'UTRs (65.5%) followed by putative promoters (50.5%), 3'UTRs (42.8%) and introns (28.7%)
compared to 96.2% in the CDS (Table 1, see Additional
file 2). This trend corresponds to GC-rich microsatellites
being frequently detected in the regions downstream of
TSS possibly due to higher GC content at the 5'end of the
rice genes [22]. The GC-rich trinucleotide GNMS repeatmotifs in the 5'UTRs and promoters perhaps serve as
binding sites for nuclear proteins that are essential for regulating translation and gene expression, and thus are
expected to occur more frequently in these sequences
[23]. The high frequency of trinucleotide GNMS repeatmotifs in the coding regions could be due to selection
against frameshift mutations that limits expansion of
non-triplet microsatellites [24]. These results agreed well
with earlier observations on the relative abundance of
GC-rich trinucleotide repeat-motifs in the expressed
sequence tags and unigene sequences of cereal genomes
[25,26]. The dinucleotide and tetranucleotide repeatmotifs were predominant particularly in the intronic and
3'UTR sequences (see Additional file 2). The AT-rich dinucleotide repeat-motifs were most in intronic sequences
(64.5%) followed by 3'UTRs (49.7%), whereas the proportion of AT-rich tetranucleotide repeats was maximum
in 3'UTRs (6.7%; Table 1). The purine-rich dinucleotide
microsatellites, such as (GA)n, were abundant in 5'UTRs
(28.6%) followed by promoters (18.4%) compared to
28% in CDS (see Additional file 1). Our observations are
comparable to those from earlier studies on abundance of
GA-rich dinucleotide repeat-motifs in the coding [25,26]
and 5'-end flanking regions [14] and AT-rich dinucleotide
motifs in the intronic sequences in rice genes [27]. The
promoter sequences of rice genes frequently (22.3%) contained pyrimidine-rich microsatellites, especially (CT)n
dinucleotides (see Additional file 1), possibly due to their
potential role in activation of promoters for transcription
initiation [28].

The microsatellite with longer repeat-motifs is expected to
be more polymorphic due to high length dependent replication slippage [27]. We identified 4,559 class I GNMS
repeat-motifs in the protein coding genes predicted in the
rice genome with an overall density of 83.8 GNMS/Mb
(Table 1). The density of the class I repeat-motif containing GNMS varied from 67.7/Mb in chromosome 1 to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/140

101.4/Mb in chromosome 12 whereas its proportion
ranged from 18.8% (877) in promoters to 26.6% (2394)
in intronic sequences (Table 1). Thus, the potential of
microsatellite expansion in the genic non-coding
sequences of rice genes is not correlated with the frequency of GC-rich trinucleotide repeat-motifs in these
regions [27]. Our results revealed non-random and
strongly biased distribution of GNMS repeat-motifs across
the regulatory and non-coding regions of the rice genes.
Design and physical location of GNMS markers
Forward and reverse primers were designed from the
flanking sequences of the identified microsatellite repeatmotifs in each of the four genic non-coding sequence
components of rice genes (i.e. promoters, 5'UTRs, introns
and 3'UTRs). The structural organization of the various
sequence components and their implications for designing different types of GNMS markers are shown in additional file 3. Primers were designed for 17,966 (92%)
genic non-coding sequences – 4,278 (91.8%) in promoters, 4,484 (92.6%) in 5'UTRs, 8,370 (93%) in introns and
834 (81.7%) in 3'UTRs. The primer sequences for 4,288
(94%) hypervariable class I GNMS markers distributed
across 12 rice chromosomes are provided in additional
file 4 (sequences for the remaining primer-pairs are available on request). Class I markers included 829 in promoters, 953 in 5'UTRs, 2,275 in introns and 231 in 3'UTRs.
The GNMS markers were present in the rice genes that regulate biological and cellular functions. For example, we
identified 51 (7 in promoters, 12 in 5'UTRs, 27 in introns,
5 in 3'UTRs) GNMS markers including 10 class I types in
various disease resistance genes predicted in rice chromosome 11 (see Additional file 3) and 25 (4 in promoters, 9
in 5'UTRs, 11 in introns, 1 in 3'UTRs) GNMS markers
including 7 class I types in rice chromosome 12 (see Additional file 4). The GNMS markers when genetically associated with the target traits would facilitate gene cloning
and marker-assisted breeding, thereby accelerating rice
genetic improvement.

We determined the distribution of class I GNMS markers
designed from the 4 genic non-coding sequence components based on their physical location (bp) on rice chromosomes. We divided each rice chromosome into 1 Mb
interval sized physical bins and integrated 4,288 class I
GNMS markers present in 3,874 rice genes based on their
ascending order of physical location (bp) beginning from
the short arm telomere to the long arm telomere (see
Additional file 5). Detailed information regarding the
physical position of the various GNMS markers on the rice
chromosomes is provided in additional file 4. The map
density of class I GNMS markers varied from 126 kb (226)
in chromosome 11 to 74 kb (487) in chromosome 3 with
an average of 100.7 kb (see Additional file 6). The maximum map density in rice chromosome 3 could be due to

Page 4 of 14

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:140

its greater physical size, maximum gene density and least
transposon association compared to other rice chromosomes [10]. In general, mapped GNMS markers showed
more concentration on both arms and towards the telomeric ends of all rice chromosomes than in the centromeric
regions except for chromosomes 4, 9 and 10 (Figure 1).
This possibly showed correspondence with the higher
density of genes on the chromosome arms/telomeric
regions of most of the rice chromosomes than in the centromeres [10,29]. A maximum of 20 and a minimum of 2
markers were present per 1 Mb physical bin of rice chromosome (Figure 1). The low number of markers in some
bins could be due to either the absence of euchromatin
sequences or least class I microsatellite containing rice
genes at these intervals. The GNMS marker based rice
physical map would provide invaluable information on
the genomic distribution of these markers and thus aid
marker selection for many applications in rice breeding
and genomics.
Amplification efficiency and polymorphic potential of
GNMS markers
We used 15 microsatellite markers designed (see Additional file 7) from each of the 4 genic non-coding
sequence components as well as from CDS of rice genes to
understand their potential to amplify the target sequence
and detect polymorphism among a set of 18 rice genotypes (7 non-aromatic indica genotypes, 6 long-grained
traditional and elite Basmati cultivars, 3 short-grained
aromatics and 2 japonica genotypes). Fifty-six of the 60
markers gave amplification around 55°C annealing temperature with a success rate of 93.3% that suggested the
utility of genic non-coding sequences (with balanced GC
content of 48% to 52%) for developing large-scale microsatellite markers in rice. The remaining 4 primers (6.7%),
which were derived from the intronic sequences, did not
show amplification in any of the non-aromatic indica and
Basmati rice genotypes. However, amplification was
observed for these markers in the japonica genotypes from
which sequence the primers were designed. The occurrence of null alleles could be due to insertion/deletions
(InDels) in the corresponding genomic sequences of
indica and japonica [30,31]. It may also be the result of frequent association of intronic microsatellites with the
micropon family of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITES) in rice [27]. Thirty (53.6%) of the
56 GNMS markers that underwent amplification showed
polymorphism (see Additional file 3). The number of
alleles amplified per locus varied from 2 to 8 (Table 2).
Thirty polymorphic GNMS markers amplified 130 alleles
with a mean allele number of 4.33. Most (80%) of the
GNMS markers showing polymorphism were class I type
repeat-motifs. The polymorphism information content
(PIC) value ranged from 0.20 to 0.86 with an average of
0.66 (Table 2). The extent of polymorphism detected by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/140

the GNMS markers is comparable to that reported previously with random genomic microsatellite markers in a
set of rice genotypes [32-34].
We detected polymorphism with 11 (73.3%, PIC of 0.72)
markers from intronic sequences, 8 from promoters
(53.3%, PIC of 0.64), 6 from 5'UTRs (40%, 0.62), 5 from
3'UTRs (33.3%, 0.58) and 4 from CDS (26.6%, 0.10)
(Table 2). Among the intronic GNMS markers, the one
based on the ubiquitin gene (see Additional file 8)
showed the maximum PIC value (0.86) followed by that
on ribosomal protein S35 (0.84). The higher level of polymorphism we observed for the GNMS markers derived
from the promoters, UTRs and introns are expected due to
the presence of the most abundant and polymorphic class
of GA- or AT-rich dinucleotide microsatellite repeatmotifs in these sequence components. Further, a comparative evaluation of the polymorphic potential of 225
GNMS markers distributed over 12 rice chromosomes
with that of 600 rice microsatellite (RM) [35] series markers in two parental genotypes (Jaya and NPT-11) of a large
mapping population revealed higher efficiency for GNMS
markers (32%) over RM markers (19%) in detecting
parental polymorphism (unpublished results). The
GNMS markers, being more informative than the genic
coding and random genomic microsatellite markers
developed earlier would be of immediate use in efficient
large-scale genotyping applications in rice [36]. Twentysix (46.4%) of the 56 GNMS markers showed polymorphism between the indica and japonica genotypes, while
22 (39.3%) revealed polymorphism among the indica
genotypes. GNMS markers derived from the intronic
sequences showed maximum inter sub-specific polymorphism as reported for intron length polymorphisms in
rice [37]. Sequencing of the amplicons obtained with the
8 GNMS markers, from the genic non-coding and coding
sequence components that showed amplification for all
the 18 rice genotypes, confirmed the presence of target
repeat motifs (see Additional file 9).
Assessment of molecular genetic diversity among
domesticated rice cultivar groups
The pair-wise similarity index among the 18 rice genotypes, based on the combined profiles of all the 56 GNMS
markers, revealed a broad range from 0.15 to 0.74 with an
average of 0.33 (see Additional file 10). This level of diversity is much higher than that detected previously (0.32 to
0.58 with an average of 0.44 [33], 0.45 to 0.61 with an
average of 0.39 [34]) with random genomic microsatellite
markers. Our result indicates the greater efficiency of
GNMS markers, which assayed potentially functional
genetic diversity in the rice genome. The aromatic group
(including long- and short-grained aromatics) had a relatively higher average similarity (0.24) with japonica compared to indica genotypes (0.13). The results of higher

Figure distribution of bin-mapped GNMS markers on rice chromosomes
Physical 1
Physical distribution of bin-mapped GNMS markers on rice chromosomes. The distribution frequency of 4,288 class
I mapped GNMS markers on 12 rice chromosomes. The frequency corresponds to number of GNMS markers mapped per 1
Mb sized bins. In general, the mapped GNMS markers showed more concentration on both the arms and towards the telomeric ends of all rice chromosomes compared to those of centromeric regions except for chromosomes 4, 9 and 10, which are
known to be highly heterochromatic.

evolutionary closeness between japonica and aromatics are
consistent with earlier nuclear and chloroplast diversity
studies based on microsatellite [34] and single nucleotide
polymorphism [38] markers. The long-grained aromatic
cultivars were most divergent as reflected by their broader
similarity index (range: 0.29 to 0.58, average 0.42). This
could be due to the inclusion of both traditional and
improved Basmati cultivars in this group. The higher level
of diversity among long-grained aromatics further agreed
well with our observations of higher proportion of polymorphic loci in these cultivars. The relationship among
the 18 rice genotypes is depicted in an unrooted phylogenetic tree (Figure 2). It revealed two distinct clusters: one
comprising long-grained traditional and elite Basmati,
short-grained aromatics and japonica genotypes; and
another comprising only indica genotypes. The GNMS
marker based clustering clearly differentiated all 18 rice
genotypes from each other and resulted in a definitive
grouping with high bootstrap values (71 to 100) that corresponded well with their known phenotypic classification and evolutionary relationships [32-34]. These GNMS
markers could be used for establishing distinctness among
rice varieties.
Evolutionary significance of CNMS containing rice
promoters
Using inter-genomic phylogenetic footprinting we
detected 112 CNMS repeats (14.6% of the 767 microsatellites containing promoter sequences of rice genes) in the
putative promoter sequences of orthologous genes among
5 cereal genomes (viz. barley, maize, rice, Sorghum, wheat;
see Additional file 11) and 67 (8.7%) CNMS repeats in
the promoters of orthologous genes of rice and A. thaliana
(see Additional file 12). With intra-genomic phylogenetic
footprinting we identified 45 (5.9%) CNMS markers in
the promoters of paralogous rice genes (see Additional file
13). The CNMS markers identified among the 5 cereal
genomes included 43 in the promoters between orthologous rice and maize genes, 26 between rice and barley, 28
between rice and wheat and 15 between rice and Sorghum

(see Additional file 11). Results from intra- and intergenomic phylogenetic footprinting comparisons showed
that 11 CNMS motifs were conserved in the promoters of
both orthologous and paralogous rice genes (see Additional file 14). The CT-rich dinucleotide repeat-motifs
were the predominant microsatellite classes in the CNMS,
which is consistent with the characteristics of pyrimidinerich repeat distribution in the promoter regions of the rice
genes as observed in our study. A low frequency of CNMS
motifs indicated a relatively rapid evolution of rice promoters having such sequences, which could be due to
functional constraints and rapid adaptive changes in the
regulatory regions of homologous genes for imparting
specific roles in gene regulation. This may be why most of
the identified CNMS repeats were located in the orthologous and paralogous genes in the immediate upstream
region (1 to 200 bp) of the transcription initiation site
with preference for known regulatory binding sites as
characterized by PLACE and PlantCARE (see Additional
file 15). It is possible that these sequences are involved in
gene regulation in response to environmental stimuli
[21]. For example, the CNMS motif (GA)n in the promoters of rice gene cytochrome P450, contained sequences
similar to GAGA (AGAGAGAGA), a known regulatory element, which is involved in light responsive phototransduction regulation in plants. Complementary to (GA)n,
the CNMS motif (CT)n contained a different regulatory
element, C2C2-GATA (TCTCTCTCTCT), controlling similar light responsive gene regulation in the serine/threonine protein kinase gene. A comparative physical
mapping of CNMS markers of rice chromosome 1 and
homeologous chromosomes of 4 other cereal species
(barley, maize, Sorghum, wheat) and one dicot species (A.
thaliana) detected several collinear regions with complex
chromosomal syntenic relationships (see Additional file
16), which provide clues to the role of identified CNMS
markers in comparative genomics and in the understanding of evolutionary complexities in cereals and Arabidopsis.

Modal nucleotide substitutions for the 11 orthologous
and paralogous rice CNMS containing promoters indicated that barley, maize, Sorghum and wheat diverged
from rice after the rice genomic duplication events (72.4
Mya) and monocot-dicot speciation (124.7 Mya) (Table
3). The divergence time between rice and each of the 4
cereal species was consistent with the separation time
(about 50 Mya) of cereals [39], of which maize (22 Mya)
has diverged more recently (Table 3). An analysis of
modal nucleotide substitutions in promoter regions of 8
sequenced CNMS loci among the domesticated rice cultivar groups indicated high modal nucleotide substitutions
(0.0010) and thus wider divergence between indica and
japonica rice from a common ancestor at 0.40 Mya (Table
3). The divergence between long-grained aromatics and
japonica was more recent (modal substitution 0.000011,
0.004 Mya) compared to short-grained aromatics from
japonica (0.000017, 0.006 Mya) and long-grained aromatics from indica (0.000033, 0.014 Mya). Among the aromatics, the divergence of short- and long-grained types
(0.000029, 0.012 Mya) was in-between the separation
time of short- and long-grained aromatics from indica
(Table 3). Our results thus supported the earlier observations about the origin of indica and japonica from an
ancestral rice genotype [40] before their domestication
about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago [41,42], and the evolutionary closeness between japonica and aromatic varieties
[34]. Our results from molecular dating of divergence
showed that indica is most diverged from others and that
aromatics are an intermediate group between indica and
japonica subspecies; much closer, however, to japonica
than indica. The higher divergence time between shortand long-grained aromatics than between each of them
and japonica was suggestive of the higher allelic diversity
within the aromatics than in indica and japonica rice culti-

vars. However, earlier studies have observed lower genetic
diversity in aromatic rice relative to other cultivar groups
[33,34]. This contrasting result is due to inclusion of pooryielding traditional Basmati varieties, which are the products of selection from land-races and improved highyielding Basmati varieties developed through cross-breeding involving traditional Basmati and non-Basmati genotypes in the aromatic group in our study.

Conclusion
We studied relative distribution of microsatellites in different sequence components of protein coding rice genes,
designed 17,966 GNMS markers, including 4,288 hypervariable class I types from the promoter, 5'UTR, intronic
and 3'UTR sequences and determined their occurrence
and organization on the 12 rice chromosomes. The class I
markers were bin-mapped to guide the selection of markers with genome wide distribution for various genotyping
applications in rice. We demonstrated the utility of GNMS
markers by their robust PCR amplification efficiency and
high potential for detecting polymorphism over genic
coding and random genomic microsatellite markers, and
thus their immediate use in rice genetics, genomics and
breeding. The unrooted phylogenetic tree constructed
based on molecular diversity values of a set of GNMS
markers in rice genotypes clearly established molecular
genetic relationships among the domesticated rice cultivar
groups, thereby suggesting their utility in defining varietal
identity in commerce. The orthologous and paralogous
CNMS markers identified in the rice promoters would be
useful for comparative genome mapping and phylogenetic analysis in rice and other members of grass family

Methods
Accessing the genic non-coding sequences of the rice
genome
The latest annotated 28,763 non-transposable element
(TE)-related rice genes (individually for each of the 12 rice
chromosomes) were acquired in FASTA format from the
TIGR rice genome annotation database release 5.0 (24th
Jan' 2007) using an ftp server [43]. Of these, 25,447 genes
were found to contain defined UTR sequences. A set of
6,512 of the 25,447 rice genes identified to have alternatively spliced isoforms were excluded from our analysis.
To determine the density of microsatellites accurately, we
screened 18,935 rice gene models representing only one
splice form with defined UTRs, CDS and introns for further analyses.
Identification and characterization of promoter sequences
For identifying and characterizing the putative promoter
sequences, we assessed the genomic FASTA sequences
1000 bp upstream of the transcription start site chromosome-wise individually for 18,935 rice genes and used the
TSSP SoftBerry plant promoter prediction program [44].
The results from 16,738 rice genes containing defined
promoter sequences with a description of putative cis-regulatory elements were stored separately for the 12 rice
chromosomes. These predicted promoter sequences were
BLAST searched against the annotated 13,046 rice eukaryotic promoter database (EPD) [45] chromosome-wise and
compared with major databases namely, PLACE [46] and
PlantCARE [47] for the identification of transcription factor binding sites and cis-regulatory elements. Based on the
BLAST results (with matching E value = 0 and bit score ≥
500), 14,308 robust promoter sequences were finally
identified in the whole rice genome for further analyses.
Mining of microsatellites and primer design
The genic non-coding sequences of 18,935 rice genes
including 14,308 putative promoter sequences were
searched for microsatellites as described earlier [26] and
compared with those with the CDS in each of the 12 rice
chromosomes. The nature, frequency and relative abundance of various repeat-motif classes including hypervariable class I (≥ 20 nucleotides) and potentially variable
class II (12 to 20 nucleotides) types were determined individually for promoters, 5'UTRs, CDS, introns and 3'UTRs
of the rice genes. We designed primers from the flanking
sequences of the identified repeat-motifs in each of these
5 sequence components of rice genes as described earlier
[26].
Distribution of GNMS markers in the rice genome
The specific physical location of class I GNMS markers
designed from the promoters, 5'UTRs, introns and 3'UTRs
of rice genes was determined based on their annotated
physical positions (bp) on the rice chromosomes pro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/140

vided in the latest released TIGR rice pseudomolecule 5.0
database. Individual rice chromosomes were divided into
1 Mb interval sized bins and the class I GNMS markers
were plotted separately for each of the 12 rice chromosomes according to their ascending order of physical location (bp).
Evaluation of amplification efficiency and polymorphic
potential
The potential of GNMS markers to amplify the target
sequence and detect polymorphism was evaluated using
15 markers we designed from the flanking sequences from
each of the 5 sequence components (promoters, 5'UTRs,
introns, 3'UTRs and CDS) of the rice genes. Genomic
DNA was isolated from a set of 18 diverse rice genotypes
(see Additional file 17) – 7 indica, 9 aromatic and 2
japonica rice genotypes – and used in PCR to amplify 75
GNMS markers. The amplified fragments were resolved in
10% native polyacrylamide gel using 0.5× TBE buffer (4 h
at 220 V) and visualized under UV light after staining with
GelStar (CAMBREX BioScience, USA). We used allelic data
to estimate the number, range and distribution of amplified alleles, average polymorphic alleles per primer, percent polymorphism and PIC for all the amplified GNMS
markers. The PIC value was calculated using the formula,
PIC = 1 - ∑Pij2 [48], where Pij is the frequency of the jth
allele for the ith locus summed across all alleles for the
locus. Cluster analysis among the 18 rice genotypes was
based on Nei and Li similarity coefficient [49] by using the
un-weighted pair group method analysis (UPGMA) in
TREECON [50] software package. We determined the confidence limit of clusters by 500 bootstrap-replicates and
constructed an unrooted phylogenetic tree by bootstrap of
50% majority rule consensus. To confirm that the GNMS
markers did amplify the expected microsatellite repeatmotifs, 8 markers from each of the promoter, 5'UTR,
intron, 3'UTR and CDS regions of rice genes that amplified in all the 18 rice genotypes were purified and
sequenced. The high quality sequences were aligned and
further examined for the presence of predicted repeat
motifs.
Detection and characterization of CNMS containing rice
promoter sequences through intra- and inter-genomic
phylogenetic footprinting
The predicted microsatellite containing promoter
sequences of rice were BLAST searched against each other
and with the 5' non-coding sequence regions of genes/
expressed sequence tags annotated on completely
sequenced bacterial artificial chromosomes anchored on
the chromosomes and/bins of maize [51], Sorghum [52],
wheat [53], barley [54] and Arabidopsis [55]. The matching
sequences were aligned using a VISTA sequence alignment
algorithm program [56,57] for identification and characterization of paralogous and orthologous CNMS contain-

ing promoters. A minimum percent nucleotide identity
threshold of 70% and 20 bp as a minimal length criterion
were considered significant in VISTA [18] for our analyses.
The matching orthologous and paralogous CNMS containing rice promoter sequences were further characterized for known functional promoter regulatory elements
using PLACE and PlantCARE software tools. The candidate CNMS containing rice promoters for cereal and A.
thaliana genomes were identified. For comparative physical mapping, the physical positions (bp) of putative
CNMS motifs on rice chromosome 1 (that carried more
CNMS than other chromosomes) were determined and
their physical order compared with that on homeologous
chromosomes of 4 other cereals and A. thaliana.
Estimation of intra- and inter-specific CNMS divergence
The CNMS containing promoter sequences of orthologous and paralogous rice genes were polled into alignments of 100–200 bp on average and used as inputs in the
baseml program within the PAML version of PAL2NAL
software package [58] for estimating nucleotide substitution rates among the CNMS sequences of cereals and A.
thaliana. For estimating substitution rates among the
indica and japonica cultivar groups, the CNMS repeatmotifs containing high quality promoter sequences of 8
rice genes that amplified in all the 18 rice genotypes were
analyzed as described above. The modal nucleotide substitution obtained for the CNMS containing rice promoter
sequences were used to estimate time (T) since divergence
among the 5 cereals and indica and japonica cultivar
groups as T (Mya) = Ks/2λ, where λ = mean rate of synonymous substitutions equal to 1.243 synonymous substitutions per 109 years [59].
