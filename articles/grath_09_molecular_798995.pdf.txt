Abstract
Background: Genes with sex-biased expression often show rapid molecular evolution between
species. Previous population genetic and comparative genomic studies of Drosophila melanogaster
and D. simulans revealed that male-biased genes have especially high rates of adaptive evolution. To
test if this is also the case for other lineages within the melanogaster group, we investigated gene
expression in D. ananassae, a species that occurs in structured populations in tropical and
subtropical regions. We used custom-made microarrays and published microarray data to
characterize the sex-biased expression of 129 D. ananassae genes whose D. melanogaster orthologs
had been classified previously as male-biased, female-biased, or unbiased in their expression and
had been studied extensively at the population-genetic level. For 43 of these genes we surveyed
DNA sequence polymorphism in a natural population of D. ananassae and determined divergence
to the sister species D. atripex and D. phaeopleura.
Results: Sex-biased expression is generally conserved between D. melanogaster and D. ananassae,
with the majority of genes exhibiting the same bias in the two species. However, about one-third
of the genes have either gained or lost sex-biased expression in one of the species and a small
proportion of genes (~4%) have changed bias from one sex to the other. The male-biased genes of
D. ananassae show evidence of positive selection acting at the protein level. However, the signal of
adaptive protein evolution for male-biased genes is not as strong in D. ananassae as it is in D.
melanogaster and is limited to genes with conserved male-biased expression in both species. Within
D. ananassae, a significant signal of adaptive evolution is also detected for female-biased and
unbiased genes.
Conclusions: Our findings extend previous observations of widespread adaptive protein
evolution to an independent Drosophila lineage, the D. ananassae subgroup. However, the rate of
adaptive evolution is not greater for male-biased genes than for female-biased or unbiased genes,
which suggests that there are differences in sex-biased gene evolution between the two lineages.

Background
Sex-biased genes, i.e. those that differ in expression level
between males and females, may be subject to differing
selective constraints depending on the sex in which they

are expressed or they may experience conflicting selective
pressures in males and females (reviewed in [1]). Previous
studies of Drosophila melanogaster have shown that malebiased genes, especially those expressed in reproductive

tissues, consistently exhibit high levels of adaptive protein
evolution [2,3]. Genome-wide comparisons of the ratio of
the nonsynonymous substitution rate to the synonymous
substitution rate (dN/dS) also indicate that male-biased
genes are more functionally divergent between closelyrelated Drosophila species and are less likely to have identifiable orthologs between distantly-related species than
genes with female-biased or unbiased expression [2,4]. A
limitation of these studies is that they rely on gene expression data from D. melanogaster for sex-bias classifications
and, thus, are not informative with respect to differences
in sex-biased gene expression or sex-biased gene evolution
between lineages.
In contrast to the studies that focused primarily on D. melanogaster, a recent SAGE (serial analysis of gene expression) study found no accelerated rate of protein evolution
for male-biased genes in D. pseudoobscura [5]. This study
measured the rate of evolution by the proportion of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN) between species and confirmed a higher rate of protein evolution in genes that had
male-biased expression in both D. melanogaster and D.
pseudoobscura, but found no evidence for an increased rate
of evolution of genes that had male-biased expression
only in D. pseudoobscura. The latter genes were only about
half as divergent as the former and showed evolutionary
rates similar to those of female-biased and unbiased
genes. These results suggest that patterns of sex-biased
gene evolution may have changed since the split of the D.
melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura lineages. To further
investigate this possibility, we analyzed sex-biased gene
expression and DNA sequence polymorphism in D. ananassae, a species within the melanogaster group that serves as
an outgroup to all species within the melanogaster subgroup, but is more closely related to D. melanogaster than
D. pseudoobscura [6,7].
D. ananassae is distributed throughout the subtropical and
tropical regions of the world. In contrast to D. melanogaster, D. ananassae is a species displaying significant
population structure [8,9]. The demographic history has
been investigated previously, with the ancestral range of
the species being defined as a region of Southeast Asia that
existed as a single landmass (Sundaland) during the late
Pleistocene around 18,000 years ago [8-10]. Ancestral
populations are expected to have colonized Asia and the
South Pacific since the last glaciation and human migration to Oceania.
In this paper, we use species-specific microarrays to investigate sex-biased gene expression in D. ananassae for a set
of genes previously investigated in D. melanogaster. We
find that 60% of these genes show conserved sex-bias,
while 40% differ in their sex-bias classification between
the two species. Using multilocus statistical tests that com-

pare ratios of polymorphism and divergence at synonymous and nonsynonymous sites, we detect a general
signal of adaptive protein evolution in D. ananassae. However, this signal is not stronger for male-biased genes than
for female-biased or unbiased genes, which is consistent
with there being differences in sex-biased gene evolution
between the D. melanogaster and D. ananassae lineages.

Results
Sex-biased gene expression in D. ananassae
To investigate sex-biased gene expression in D. ananassae,
we designed a species-specific microarray of PCR-amplified exon sequences from 148 genes (Additional file 1)
whose orthologs had been previously classified as malebiased, female-biased or unbiased in D. melanogaster (see
Methods). This set of genes was of particular interest
because the vast majority (136 genes) had been studied at
the population-genetic level in D. melanogaster and estimates of the rate of adaptive evolution in the melanogaster
subgroup were already available [2,3]. After quality control, we obtained sufficient hybridization signal to reliably classify 60 genes (22 male-biased, 13 female-biased,
and 25 unbiased). Of the remaining genes, we were able
to classify 69 (21 male-biased, 10 female-biased, and 38
unbiased) using the D. ananassae whole-genome microarray data of Zhang et al. [11]. In total, 129 of the 148 genes
(87%) were classified, with 43 male-biased, 23 femalebiased, and 63 unbiased (Additional file 2).

To examine the conservation of sex-biased gene expression between species, we compared the above D. ananassae classifications to those previously determined for D.
melanogaster. The majority of genes (59%) showed a conserved expression pattern, with the same bias in both species (Figure 1A). However, 37% of the genes were
classified as sex-biased in only one species, and 4%
showed the opposite sex-bias in the two species (Figure
1A). Overall, male-biased genes showed the greatest conservation: 72% of the genes with male-biased expression
in D. ananassae also had male-biased expression in D. melanogaster, 65% of the genes with female-biased expression
in D. ananassae also had female-biased expression in D.
melanogaster, and 48% of the genes with unbiased expression in D. ananassae also had unbiased expression in D.
melanogaster. Of the genes that were sex-biased in only one
species, most (69%) were sex-biased in D. melanogaster,
but unbiased in D. ananassae (Figure 1B). Three genes
(CG13690, CG3024, CG4593) were male-biased in D.
ananassae, but female-biased in D. melanogaster, while two
genes (CG12684, CG7387) were female-biased in D. ananassae, but male-biased in D. melanogaster (Figure 1B). For
CG13690, the molecular function is described as ribonuclease H activity and RNA binding. It is involved in the
RNA metabolic process. The molecular function of
CG3024 (torp4a) is described as ATP binding and

unfolded protein binding. The gene is involved in protein

protein binding and heat shock protein binding. It is also
involved in protein folding. For the two remaining genes,
no functions or biological processes are described. All
described functions refer to what is known for D. melanogaster.
Phylogenetic relationship of the focal species
For analysis of evolutionary rates and tests for adaptive
evolution, it is critical to have an appropriate outgroup
species. Two recent molecular phylogenetic studies suggested that D. atripex and/or D. phaeopleura might serve as
an appropriate outgroup to D. ananassae for these purposes [12,13]. However, these studies used a small
number of loci that sometimes gave conflicting results. To
further investigate the phylogenetic relationship of these
species, we used the concatenated amino acid sequences
of 12 genes that we sequenced in both D. atripex and D.
phaeopleura (Additional file 3) and for which sequence
data were available from D. ananassae, D. melanogaster, D.
simulans, and D. pseudoobscura. The concatenated alignment of 3,446 amino acid positions was used to generate
a phylogenetic tree by Bayesian inference (Figure 2). The
tree topology was strongly supported (100% posterior
clade probabilities for each node) and indicated that D.
atripex and D. phaeopleura are more closely related to each
other than either is to D. ananassae. Thus, both of these
species can be used as an outgroup to D. ananassae. Furthermore, the divergence between D ananassae and D.

atripex/D. phaeopleura is similar to the divergence between
D. melanogaster and D. simulans, which facilitates the comparison of evolutionary patterns between the melanogaster
and ananassae subgroups (see below).
Levels of polymorphism and divergence
We surveyed DNA sequence polymorphism in a sample of
12 isofemale lines from Bangkok, Thailand for a subset of
43 genes used in our microarray analysis (Additional file
3). This set included 17 male-biased genes, 12 femalebiased genes, and 14 unbiased genes. Fourteen of these
genes differed in their sex-bias classification between D.
ananassae and D. melanogaster. In addition, we sequenced
all genes in a single strain of either D. atripex or D. phaeopleura to use as an outgroup. For 13 genes we were able to
get sequences from both D. atripex and D. phaeopleura,
revealing that both exhibit similar levels of divergence to
D. ananassae (on average, 20% at synonymous sites and
2% at nonsynonymous sites) and that the choice of outgroup does not bias estimates of interspecific divergence
(Table 1).

Comparison of the divergence between D. ananassae and
D. atripex/D. phaeopleura with the divergence between D.
melanogaster and D. simulans for the different sex-bias
classes of genes suggests that the accelerated rate of evolution of male-biased genes is limited to the melanogaster
subgroup (Table 1). When comparing D. melanogaster and
D. simulans, values of dN and dN/dS are consistently higher
for male-biased genes than for female-biased or unbiased

On average, synonymous polymorphism is slightly higher
in D. ananassae than in D. melanogaster, suggesting that the
former has a slightly larger effective population size (Ne).
This is consistent with the Bangkok population representing an ancestral population of D. ananassae [8]. Taken
together, levels of polymorphism and divergence suggest
that our D. ananassae population and outgroup species are
appropriate for comparison to the African D. melanogaster
population with D. simulans as an outgroup.

genes, which is not the case for comparisons of D. ananassae to either D. atripex or D. phaeopleura (Table 1).
However, there is no significant difference in dN/dS
between male-biased genes on the different lineages
(Mann-Whitney test, P > 0.05). It should be noted, however, that the number and identity of the genes are not
constant among the three comparisons.
Levels of DNA sequence polymorphism in the Bangkok
population of D. ananassae are comparable to levels in an
ancestral African population of D. melanogaster (Table 2).

We also investigated levels of synonymous polymorphism
on the X chromosome relative to the autosomes in both
D. ananassae and D. melanogaster. This provides an estimate of the effective population size of males and females
in each species. The ratio is expected to be 3/4 if there is
an equal number of breeding males and females in the
population. If there is sexual selection acting on males,
the male effective population size will be reduced and the
X:autosome polymorphism ratio will be increased above
3/4. After standardizing polymorphism by divergence to
correct for possible differences in mutation rate between
the X and the autosomes, we find that the X:autosome
polymorphism ratio is greater than 3/4 for both species
(Table 3). To test the significance of this, we multiplied
the X chromosomal values by 4/3 and compared them to
the autosomal values with a Mann-Whitney test. For D.
melanogaster, the difference was significant (P = 0.04),
indicating that the original ratio was significantly greater
than 3/4. For D. ananassae, an X:autosome polymorphism
ratio of 3/4 could not be rejected (P = 0.13). There was no
significant difference in the X:autosome polymorphism
ratio between D. ananassae and D. melanogaster (P = 0.42).

McDonald-Kreitman tests
To evaluate the type of selection operating on individual
genes, we applied single-locus McDonald-Kreitman (MK)
tests [14] to the 43 genes for which we had polymorphism
data from D. ananassae and divergence data from either D.
atripex or D. phaeopleura. In total, six genes (14%) gave a
significant MK test result (Additional file 3). Half of the
significant genes departed from neutrality in the direction
of positive selection (i.e. a relative excess of nonsynonymous divergence) (Table 4), while the other half departed
from neutrality in a pattern consistent with either balancing or weak purifying selection (i.e. a relative excess of
nonsynonymous polymorphism). These are likely to be
cases of weak purifying selection, as average values of
Tajima's D [15] are significantly negative at nonsynonymous sites (Table 5), which suggests that many segregating nonsynonymous polymorphisms are slightly
deleterious.

A comparison of our MK test results to those from D. melanogaster/D. simulans [2,3] revealed that, in all but one
case (CG10750), the individual genes showing significant
evidence for positive selection (i.e. those with MK-test Pvalues less than 0.05) differed between the two lineages
(Table 4). Most genes significant for positive selection
were male-biased in at least one of the species. However,
the proportion of positively-selected male-biased genes in
D. ananassae (1/17 = 6%) was not as high as in previous
studies of D. melanogaster where 7/33 (21%) of autosomal
male-biased [3], and 7/17 (41%) of X-linked male-biased
genes [2] gave significant MK tests for positive selection.
Of the three genes with significant MK tests for positive
selection in D. ananassae, one (CG6980) showed conserved male-biased expression between D. ananassae and
D. melanogaster, while two (CG14717 and CG10750) were
male-biased in D. melanogaster, but unbiased in D. ananassae (Table 4).
To further investigate expression class-dependent patterns
of evolution, we constructed 12 groups of genes (Table 6).
The first nine classes were partitioned with regard to sexbias in D. ananassae and D. melanogaster. This allowed us
to compare genes with conserved sex-bias between the
two species with genes showing sex-bias in only one speTable 3: Synonymous polymorphism and divergence at X-linked

cies or genes showing a reversal of sex-bias between species. The final three classes were partitioned solely on
expression in D. ananassae, without regard to expression
in D. melanogaster. Application of the MK test to the
summed values of polymorphism and divergence within
each group [16] revealed a significant departure from neutrality in the direction of positive selection for genes with
conserved male-biased expression and for genes with
male-biased expression private to D. melanogaster,
whereas the female-biased and unbiased genes did not
differ significantly from the neutral expectation (Table 6).
The genes with male-biased gene expression private to D.
ananassae also did not differ significantly from the neutral
expectation.
Estimation of the proportion of adaptive amino acid
replacements
We also used a multi-locus version of the MK test to estimate Î±, the fraction of amino acid replacements between
species that were fixed by positive selection [17]. For this,
we divided the genes into six different groups. First, we
considered male-, female-, and unbiased genes that had
conserved sex-biased expression between D. melanogaster
and D. ananassae. Second, we considered the genes
according only to their bias in D. ananassae. We could not
consider all 12 groups of genes mentioned above, because
some of the groups contained too few genes to allow maximum likelihood analysis (e.g. there were only two genes
with male-biased expression private to D. ananassae).
Because the segregation of slightly deleterious nonsynonymous mutations can lead to a downward bias in the estimate of Î±, we excluded all polymorphisms (both
synonymous and nonsynonymous) segregating at frequency â¤ 15% from our analysis [18].

For the genes with conserved sex-biased expression
between species, we observed a significant signal of positive selection only for those with conserved male-biased
expression, although in all cases the mean estimate of a
was greater than zero (Figure 3). However, when we considered the genes only by their sex-bias classification in D.
ananassae we found evidence for adaptive evolution in all
three classes of genes, with higher Î± estimates and more
significant departures from neutrality detected for femalebiased and unbiased genes than for male-biased genes
(Figure 3). Thus, the increased rate of adaptive evolution
seen for male-biased genes appears to be limited to those
with conserved male-biased expression between the two
species. For D. ananassae, estimates of Î± were 43%, 60%,
and 53% for male-biased, female-biased, and unbiased
genes, respectively.

Discussion
Although sex-biased expression was conserved between
D. ananassae and D. melanogaster for the majority of the
genes we analyzed, a large minority (40%) showed a gain,

loss, or reversal of sex-biased expression between species
(Figure 1). In a previous microarray study, Ranz et al. [19]
found that 20% of genes showed a gain, loss, or reversal
of sex-biased expression between D. melanogaster and D.
simulans. The higher percentage observed in the present
study is likely attributable to the greater evolutionary distance separating D. melanogaster and D. ananassae (Figure
2), which provides more opportunity for expression
changes. Consistent with this, a previous SAGE study
found that 34% of genes changed their sex-biased expression pattern between D. melanogaster and the more distantly-related D. pseudoobscura [5].
Several aspects of our experimental design might also contribute to the gene expression patterns described above.
First, the genes on our array were not a random set, but
instead were enriched for those showing strong sex-biased
expression in multiple, independent experiments in D.
melanogaster. Thus, we might expect to see an overrepresentation of genes that are sex-biased only in D. melanogaster, and an underrepresentation of genes that are sexbiased only in D. ananassae. Indeed, this is what we find:
of the 48 genes that are sex-biased in only one species, 33
(69%) are sex-biased in D. melanogaster, while only 15
(31%) are sex-biased in D. ananassae (Figure 1B). A second factor that may influence our results is that our D.
ananassae classifications come from a combination of our

own experimental data and those from a published
whole-genome microarray study [11] and the two studies
differ in their design and replication. Our own microarray
experiments examined only a small set of genes, which
allowed for many replicate probes per gene to be present
on each array. We also enforced strict quality control to
exclude genes with weak hybridization signal (which
would otherwise be classified as unbiased). The use of the
published whole-genome arrays allowed us to classify
more genes, but the classification may be less reliable due
to the lower replication and the increased problem of
multiple testing that weakens the statistical analysis.
Indeed, the whole-genome data classify a higher fraction
of unbiased genes (68% vs. 33% for our custom arrays),
which would be expected since the null hypothesis of
these comparisons is that there is no difference in expression level between males and females. Also, it should be
noted that the whole-genome arrays of Zhang et al. [11]
only identified ~12% of the D. ananassae transcriptome as
sex-biased, while the previous studies that our D. melanogaster classifications are based on identified 20-70% of
the transcriptome as sex-biased [19-22]. This difference is
most likely the result of differences in experimental design
and statistical power between the studies, not an underlying difference in the amount of sex-biased expression
between the two species, as Zhang et al. [11] also reported
similarly low percentages of sex-biased genes in six other
Drosophila species, including D. melanogaster.

Despite the presumably weaker power to detect sex-biased
expression in D. ananassae, we observed 15 genes that
were sex-biased in D. ananassae, but unbiased in D. melanogaster (Figure 1B). For 12 of these genes, the ancestral
expression state could be inferred using microarray data
from the outgroup species D. pseudoobscura [11] (Additional file 4). Interestingly, 11 of these 12 genes showed a
match between the D. melanogaster and the D. pseudoob-

was gained on the D. ananassae lineage in the vast majority of cases. The ancestral expression state could also be

sex-bias between D. melanogaster and D. ananassae. Three
of these genes were female-biased in D. melanogaster and
D. pseudoobscura, but male-biased in D. ananassae. One

nogaster, but female-biased in D. ananassae. However, this
gene (CG7387) also differed in its sex-bias classification
between our custom microarrays (female-biased) and the
whole-genome D. ananassae microarrays (male-biased)
[11]. Thus, it is possible that the sex-biased expression of
this gene is strain- or condition-dependent. This was the
only such conflict between the two D. ananassae expression datasets, although there were 26 cases where a gene
was classified as sex-biased in one dataset and unbiased in
the other.
Our survey of DNA sequence polymorphism in D. ananassae is the largest performed to date in terms of number
of loci investigated and the first to examine genes with
sex-biased expression. Overall, the level of polymorphism
in the D. ananassae population from Bangkok, Thailand is
similar to that in an ancestral African D. melanogaster population, which is consistent with Bangkok being within
the ancestral species range of D. ananassae [8]. When considering all loci we find that D. ananassae has slightly
more synonymous polymorphism than D. melanogaster
(Table 2), which suggest that the former has a larger Ne.
Consistent with this interpretation, nonsynonymous polymorphism and the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphism are lower in D. ananassae (Table 2).
This is expected if most segregating nonsynonymous
mutations are slightly deleterious, as is suggested by their
negative values of Tajima's D (Table 4), because purifying
selection is more effective at removing deleterious mutations when Ne is large.
Multi-locus analyses of polymorphism and divergence
indicate that adaptive protein evolution is prevalent in D.
ananassae, with estimates of Î± in the range of 50-60%
(Table 3 and Figure 3). These Î± values are remarkably similar to those estimated for other Drosophila species
(reviewed in [23]), which suggests that there is a consist-

ently high rate of adaptive protein evolution throughout
the genus. However, despite the strong overall signal of
positive selection acting on D. ananassae proteins, we do
not see clear differences in the prevalence of adaptive protein evolution among male-, female-, and unbiased genes.
This contrasts with previous results from D. melanogaster
that indicated an increased rate of adaptive evolution in
male-biased genes [2,3], but is consistent with the results
of Metta et al. [5], who found accelerated rates of evolution (as measured by dN) for D. melanogaster male-biased
genes, but not D. pseudoobscura male-biased genes. We see
the same general trend for dN (and dN/dS) values in our
data, which are highest for the male-biased genes of D.
melanogaster, but lower for the male-biased genes of D.
ananassae (Table 1). Taken together, these results suggest
that male-biased genes have experienced an increase in
the rate of adaptive protein evolution since the divergence
of the ananassae and melanogaster subgroups (Figure 2).
The above results could be explained if sexual selection
drives the evolution of many male-biased genes and the
prevalence of sexual selection differs between the two subgroups. In ancestral D. melanogaster populations, X-linked
synonymous polymorphism is significantly greater than
3/4 of autosomal synonymous polymorphism [24],
which is expected if sexual selection acts on males
(reviewed in [25]). We observe a similar pattern for D.
ananassae (Table 3), suggesting that sexual selection does
not differ greatly between the species. However, due to the
relatively small number of D. ananassae loci, we cannot
detect a significant difference between the observed
X:autosome diversity ratio and the expected ratio of 3/4,
nor can we detect a significant difference in this ratio
between D. ananassae and D. melanogaster. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that sexual selection is weaker
in the D. ananassae lineage. Mate-choice experiments,
however, indicate that there is significant female mate
preference in D. ananassae [26] and that male courtship
song plays a major role in female mate discrimination
[27]. Furthermore, it has been shown that D. ananassae
males are subject to stronger intrasexual selection than
females and that male mating success is correlated with
morphological traits, such as body size and sternopleural
bristle number [28]. These findings suggest that sexual
selection plays an important role in the species' evolution.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/291

female expression ratios across different experiments and
microarray platforms, it is likely that most of the genes
investigated had a stronger male-bias in D. melanogaster
than in D. ananassae. If the degree of male bias is correlated with the rate of adaptive evolution across the genus,
as it appears to be in the melanogaster subgroup [2], it
could explain differences in male-biased gene evolution
between the lineages. This possibility could be addressed
in future studies focusing on genes with exceptionally
strong male-biased expression in D. ananassae. However,
there is not a significant correlation between dN/dS and the
male/female expression ratio within our D. ananassae
dataset (Pearson's R = 0.10, P = 0.52). In general, the
female-biased genes included in our study showed weaker
sex-biased expression than the male-biased genes in D.
melanogaster (4-fold vs. 12-fold). This might explain why
expression conservation between D. melanogaster and D.
ananassae was greater for male-biased genes than femalebiased genes (Figure 1), as highly biased genes are more
likely to de detected as significant, while weakly biased
genes are more likely to be non-significant and classified
as unbiased.

Conclusions
Although sex-biased gene expression is abundant in Drosophila species, the sex-biased expression pattern of many
genes differs between species. Species-specific microarray
data indicate that 26% of genes with a strong sex bias in
D. melanogaster show no detectable sex bias in D. ananassae, while 12% of genes with unbiased expression in D.
melanogaster show significantly sex-biased expression in
D. ananassae. The accelerated rate of adaptive evolution
seen for male-biased genes in D. melanogaster is not
observed for male-biased genes in D. ananassae, which
suggests that there are differences in sex-biased gene evolution between the two lineages. This is in agreement with
a previous study on rates of protein evolution in D. pseudoobscura [5] and suggests that the rapid adaptive evolution of male-biased genes is unique to the melanogaster
subgroup and not a general pattern in Drosophilids.
Despite these differences, the overall signal of adaptive
protein evolution is strong in D. ananassae (Î± â 50%) and
is consistent with previous estimates throughout the
genus.

Methods
The observed differences in male-biased gene evolution
between D. ananassae and D. melanogaster could also be
influenced by the particular genes that were investigated.
Our initial gene set was enriched for genes that showed
strong and consistent sex-biased expression across multiple D. melanogaster microarray experiments. On average,
the subset of male-biased genes showed a 12-fold malebias in D. melanogaster, but only a 5-fold male bias in D.
ananassae. While it is difficult to directly compare male/

Microarray analysis
To analyze sex-biased gene expression in D. ananassae, we
designed a species-specific PCR-amplicon microarray. We
began with a set of 148 genes that had previously been
studied in D. melanogaster [2,3] and used the available D.
ananassae genome sequence (Assembly August 2005;
http://genome.ucsc.edu/[29]) to identify their orthologs
and design PCR primers that amplify exonic sequences
(mean length = 458 bp). A complete list of genes and PCR

primers is provided in (Additional file 1). PCR products
were purified using genPURE PCR 96 well filter plates
(Genetix) and spotted on UltraGAPS slides (Corning)
using a GeneMachines OmniGrid Accent microarrayer. D.
ananassae genomic DNA (gDNA) was also spotted as a
control. Eight replicates of each gene probe were spotted
per array, with each replicate in a different subarray. 12-14
control gDNA probes were spotted per subarray.
For hybridization, we extracted total RNA from four- to
five-day old males and females using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and the manufacturer's protocol. Two inbred
strains of D. ananassae from Kota Kinabalu, Borneo were
used for RNA extraction [8]. Reverse transcription was performed using 25 Î¼g of total RNA and an anchored
oligo(dT) primer. cDNA was labelled with fluorescent
dyes (Alexa Fluor 555 and 647) using the amino-allyl
labelling system (Invitrogen). Labelled male and female
cDNA was competitively hybridized to the arrays for 20
hours at 42 C. Arrays were scanned using a Genetix aQuire
2-laser microarray scanner and the Genetix Qscan software. In total, we performed 12 replicate hybridizations.
Six of these were biological replicates, i.e. from different
RNA extractions performed at different times, while the
other six were "dye-swap" replicates where we exchanged
the fluorescent dyes used to label male and female cDNA
within each biological replicate.
Prior to statistical analysis, normalization of the two dye
channels was performed. Since our arrays contained only
a subset of the genome with a non-random distribution of
sex-biased genes, we used the gDNA spots as controls for
normalization. The signal for each spot was calculated by
subtracting the median local background from the mean
spot intensity. If this result was negative for a given channel, that channel was assigned a value of 0.5 according to
the MINIMUM approach of LIMMA [30]. For each replicate subarray, the red/green ratio was calculated for each
of the gDNA control spots and the mean of these ratios
was taken as the normalization factor. The raw red value
of each spot was then multiplied by this factor to obtain
the normalized red value used to calculate the corrected
red/green ratio. Note that this is a local normalization,
with a different normalization factor for each replicate
subarray. As a quality control measure, only spots with a
mean intensity at least 20% above the mean local background in at least one of the channels were used. For any
one array, we required that at least half of the replicate
spots per gene (in this case four) displayed adequate signal as defined above. The median red/green ratio (after
normalization) of these replicate spots was used for statistical analysis using the BAGEL software [31,32]. To determine the P-value cut-off used to define significant sexbiased genes, we performed randomizations of the BAGEL
input file to estimate the false-discovery rate (FDR) for the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/291

dataset. For classification of sex-biased genes, we used a Pvalue cut-off of 0.01, which corresponds to a FDR of 10%.
All new microarray data have been deposited in NCBI's
Gene Expression Omnibus [33] and are accessible
through GEO Series accession number GSE19096 http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/
acc.cgi?acc=GSE19096.
Fly strains, polymerase chain reaction and DNA
sequencing
For the polymorphism survey, we used 12 inbred strains
of D. ananassae from Bangkok, Thailand. Like the Kota
Kinabalu strains used for the microarray experiments,
these strains were included in a previous population
genetic survey of intronic loci and found to be in the
ancestral range of D. ananassae [8]. Thus, we expect little
differentiation between these populations. We chose the
Bangkok population for the polymorphism survey
because a larger number of strains were available.

One strain each of D. atripex and D. phaeopleura (kindly
provided by M. Schug) were used as outgroups. We used
the D. ananassae genome (Assembly August 2005; http://
genome.ucsc.edu/[34]) to design PCR primers flanking
the coding sequence of 43 target genes. These genes were
chosen to represent different categories of sex-biased gene
expression on the basis of the microarray data described
above. Following PCR, the amplified products were purified with ExoSAP-IT (USB, Cleveland, OH) and sequenced
on both strands using BigDye version 1.1 chemistry and a
3730 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA). The PCR primers were also used as sequencing
primers in the polymorphism survey. A complete list of
primers is provided in Additional file 5. For some genes,
we were unable to get successful PCR or DNA sequence
from all 12 D. ananassae strains (Additional file 3). The
average number of strains sequenced per gene was 11 and
we required at least eight sequences for a gene to be
included in our analysis. All new DNA sequences have
been submitted to the GenBank/EMBL databases under
accession numbers FN546265-FN546780.
Analysis of polymorphism and divergence
Sequences were edited using DNAstar (Madison, WI) and
multiple alignments were calculated using MUSCLE
[35]http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/muscle/. Polymorphism
and divergence statistics were calculated using DnaSP 4.5
[36]. For McDonald-Kreitman (MK) table data we used
the number of segregating mutations instead of the
number of segregating sites as some genes had sites with
three segregating variants. For divergence, we considered
only sites with fixed differences between all D. ananassae
lines and a single D. atripex (or D. phaeopleura) sequence.
Multilocus Tajima's D tests were performed using the HKA

amino acid substitutions, a, with the method of [17], we
used the DoFE program http://www.lifesci.sussex.ac.uk/
home/Adam_Eyre-Walker/Website/Software.html.
For
MK tests and a calculations, the D. atripex sequence was
used as the outgroup whenever available. When the D.
atripex sequence was not available, D. phaeopleura was
used as the outgroup.
Phylogenetic analysis
For 13 genes we were able to get sequences from both D.
atripex and D. phaeopleura [Additional file 3]. In addition,
we downloaded the amino acid sequences of D. melanogaster, D. simulans, D. ananassae, and D. pseudoobscura
for the entire set of genes analyzed from Flybase http://fly
base.org/. For one gene (CG18418), we were unable to get
the orthologous sequence from D. pseudoobscura. This left
us with 12 genes that could be aligned across all species
(CG2577, CG3004, CG3024, CG4593, CG6459, CG7840,
CG8277, CG9135, CG10853, CG11379, CG15336, and
CG15717). Amino acid sequences of these 12 genes were
concatenated for phylogenetic reconstruction Bayesian
inference (BI), as implemented in MrBayes version 3.1.1
[37], was used to reconstruct the phylogeny with D. pseudoobscura set as the outgroup. For the BI analysis, two distinct 10,000 generation runs were conducted (three
incrementally heated chains with model jumping
between fixed-rate amino acid models were used and trees
were saved to a file every 10 generations). Identical topologies were recovered from both runs. A burn-in period of
2,500 generations was determined graphically by plotting
likelihood values for each sample. The results were presented in the form of a 50% majority-rule consensus tree
in which trees corresponding to the burn-in period were
discarded. Support for the nodes was given by posterior
probability estimates of clades. Using model jumping,
only the Jones (JTT) model [38] contributed to the final
result with 100% posterior probability. This was also supported by the program ProtTest version 2.0 [39], which
determines the best-fit substitution model for amino acid
data under a likelihood framework. Within this framework, the Akaike information criterion [40] selected the
JTT [38] model including the proportion of invariable
sites and the gamma distribution of rate variation among
sites (JTT + I + G) as the best-fitting model with an Akaike
weight of 0.54. The second-best model was JTT+G with an
Akaike weight of 0.46. Trees were visualized with
TreeView [41].
