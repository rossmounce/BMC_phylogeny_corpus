Abstract
Salamanders of the genus Ambystoma are a unique model organism system because they enable
natural history and biomedical research in the laboratory or field. We developed Sal-Site to
integrate new and existing ambystomatid salamander research resources in support of this model
system. Sal-Site hosts six important resources: 1) Salamander Genome Project: an informationbased web-site describing progress in genome resource development, 2) Ambystoma EST Database:
a database of manually edited and analyzed contigs assembled from ESTs that were collected from
A. tigrinum tigrinum and A. mexicanum, 3) Ambystoma Gene Collection: a database containing fulllength protein-coding sequences, 4) Ambystoma Map and Marker Collection: an image and database
resource that shows the location of mapped markers on linkage groups, provides information
about markers, and provides integrating links to Ambystoma EST Database and Ambystoma Gene
Collection databases, 5) Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center: a website and collection of databases
that describe an NSF funded salamander rearing facility that generates and distributes biological
materials to researchers and educators throughout the world, and 6) Ambystoma Research
Coordination Network: a web-site detailing current research projects and activities involving an
international group of researchers. Sal-Site is accessible at http://www.ambystoma.org.

Background
Salamanders of the genus Ambystoma are important model
organisms in biological research. Their seminal role in
experimental embryology and broad utility in laboratorybased science is well known [1]. Ambystomatid salamanders are currently used in multiple areas including olfaction, vision, cardiogenesis, embryogenesis, sensory
system development, genomics, and post-embryonic
development, including organ and tissue regeneration [2-

10]. Moreover, Ambystoma is very different from typical
laboratory models because much is also known about
their ecology, evolution, and natural history. The group is
a model in studies of life history and natural phenotypic
variation, infectious disease, evolutionary developmental
biology, and conservation biology [11-18]. In these
respects, Ambystoma is a complete model organism system
that offers integrative research opportunities spanning the
continuum of biological organization.

will enhance communication across the Ambystoma community and provide a translational mechanism for
researchers working in other model organism systems.
Below we describe six resources that are accessible
through Sal-Site.

Salamander Genome Project (SGP)
The SGP [25], supported by the National Center for
Research Resources at the National Institute of Health, is
currently developing Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) and
a genetic linkage map (see below). Expressed sequence
tags are multifunctional resources because they can be
developed for a number of uses, including population
and quantitative genetics, comparative genomics, in situ
hybridization, and functional genomics [21-23]. ESTs are
especially useful in the ambystomatid system because
sequence information from A. mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum can be easily extended to enable research in other
species [11,15,21], as well as in distantly related vertebrates [24]. Sequences deriving from assembled ESTs are
also providing the majority of markers for the Ambystoma
genetic linkage map [22]. The SGP website was originally
developed as a web-interface to allow registered members
access to EST and gene mapping data as it was collected.
These separate functions are now accomplished through
separate but integrated databases that are described
below, and there is no longer a requirement for users to
register to access these databases. The SGP website now
primarily functions to provide information about the
project and update progress made in developing genome
resources.

curated assemblies exclude mitochondrial transcripts.
Recent and on-going molecular resource development is
providing new tools for research using ambystomatid salamanders. The Salamander Genome Project (SGP) has
recently developed and annotated thousands of expressed
sequence tags (ESTs) for A. mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum
[19,20], generated complete mtDNA sequence for 5 different ambystomatid species [21], and completed the first
comprehensive genetic linkage map [22]. Markers that
have been developed from these ESTs are providing new
probes for molecular studies as well as markers for population and quantitative genetics, and phylogenetics
[11,15,23]. This recent flurry of resource development
stands to greatly increase the utility of ambystomatid salamanders, however there is a need to refine and integrate
new resources with existing databases and information.
To meet this need, we created Sal-Site [24], a web-portal
that functions to integrate new and existing ambystomatid resources. The collation of resources through Sal-Site

Ambystoma EST database (AESTdb)
Although all of the EST sequences developed under the
SGP [19,20] are available to the community through
NCBI, these ESTs represent an immense collection of
unedited data to sift through and sequencing errors are
common. The AESTdb [26] was developed in order to
organize Ambystoma ESTs into edited model RNA
sequences and integrate these sequences with related databases. To create the AESTdb, we first performed separate
automated assemblies for all available ESTs that have
been generated for the species A. mexicanum and A. t. tigrinum [see also [20]], including a subset of A. mexicanum
ESTs that are available as unedited contigs from the Axolotl EST Database [19,27]. Automated assembly methods
may efficiently correct sequencing errors when large numbers of ESTs are analyzed because it is possible to efficiently identify sequencing and assembly errors against
the backdrop of multiple overlapping sequences. However, the SGP has thus far generated an intermediate
number of ESTs (~55,000) and many of the assembled
contigs contained one or few EST members. As a result,
automated methods for error detection were less efficient
at detecting sequencing errors and many incorrect base

calls were detected upon visual inspection of assembled
trace data.
The prevalence of sequence errors among existing
Ambystoma assemblies necessitated development of a
quality-controlled manual editing methodology to minimize error rates within AESTdb contig sequences (Figure
1). All contigs were manually edited in two rounds by visually inspecting aligned trace files, removing low quality
sequence ends, and correcting base miscalls. After manual
editing, contigs were searched against the human RefSeq
and Xenopus UniGene databases using the BLASTx and
tBLASTx algorithms respectively. If a contig exhibited significant sequence similarity (E value > 1e-7) to a human
or Xenopus protein-coding sequence, the presumptive
ortholog, the reading frame, the translated sequence, and
alignment statistics were recorded in individual files that
also provide hyperlinks to associate contig sequences with
gene and marker files in the Ambystoma Gene Collection
(AGC) and Ambystoma Genetic Map and Marker Collection (AMAP) (Figure 2). For example, if the sequence of a
contig was used to develop a PCR amplifiable molecular
marker, a hyperlink was included to link the contig file to
the molecular marker file in the AMAP database (see
below). The AESTdb has a user-friendly web-interface that
allows BLAST or textual searching of contigs and access to
contig and associated raw EST sequence data.

Ambystoma Gene Collection (AGC)
Analyses of gene function are greatly facilitated by knowledge of full-length RNA and amino acid sequences. The
AGC [28] acts as a repository for presumptive full-length
sequences from multiple sources, including: AESTdb,
sequences parsed from existing databases (e.g. NCBI), and
sequences derived from the community at large. We have
identified several putative full-length sequences for A.
mexicanum (n = 940) and A. t. tigrinum (n = 717) contigs
using the program MuSeqBox [29]. Comparisons against
curated full-length protein-coding sequences from the
human RefSeq database were performed using three
length thresholds for variable amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal regions (20, 50, and 100 amino acids). The
majority of putative full-length sequences that were iden-

tified showed greater than 50% amino acid sequence
identity and greater than 80% sequence coverage when
compared to their best human BLASTx hit (Tables 1 and
2). Individual AGC files contain source RNA sequences
and predicted amino acid sequences, as well as supplementary fields that provide the best human RefSeq BLAST
hit used for analysis of sequence coverage, percent
sequence coverage of the best BLAST hit, and percent
sequence identity between human and Ambystoma amino
acid sequences. Files provided in the AGC are hyperlinked
to corresponding ESTs and marker sequences in the AESTdb and AMAP as well as NCBI sequence records for corresponding human RefSeq proteins.

Ambystoma Genetic Map & Marker Collection
(AMAP)
Although the genomes of ambystomatid salamanders are
approximately 10× larger than the human genome [30],
the first complete genetic linkage map for any amphibian
(including Xenopus) was recently assembled using an
interspecific mapping cross between A. mexicanum and A.
t. tigrinum. This resource is allowing the mapping of QTL
and mutant phenotypes, and the identification of conserved vertebrate syntenies [22,31]. The AMAP website
[32] provides images showing the location of mapped
markers on linkage groups that correspond to the 14 chromosome pairs in Ambystoma. Individual linkage groups
can also be accessed as separate datasets in tabular format.
These datasets provide precise map distances for all EST
and gene-based markers, as well as hyperlinks to separate
marker files that provide additional marker specific information including assembly source sequence (hyperlinked
to AESTdb records), primer, and polymorphism detection
information.

Ambystoma Genetic Stock Center (AGSC)
Recognizing the importance of A. mexicanum as a research
model, the National Science Foundation has funded continually since 1969 a genetically homogenous collection
of animals from which biological materials are distributed
throughout the world. This collection is currently housed
within the AGSC at the University of Kentucky (formerly
the Indiana University Axolotl Colony). The AGSC web-

site [33] provides a user-friendly interface to purchase A.
mexicanum biomaterials, including embryos, larvae, juveniles, adults, and soon, transgenics. This site also provides
a broad range of information including animal care and
handling protocols, a history of the axolotl (A. mexicanum) collection, descriptions of strains and mutants, staging series for embryos and limb development, and a
collection of detailed techniques and protocols. The
AGSC periodically distributes an electronic newsletter,
called Axolotl Newsletter that contains new developments
in Ambystoma research and husbandry as well as other
items of general interest to the Ambystoma community.

Ambystoma Research Coordination Network
(ARCN)
The Ambystoma Research Coordination Network (ARCN)
[34] is comprised of an international group of investigators from diverse organizations. One of the goals is to help
participants become better aware of available and emerging resources, biological information, and collaborative
opportunities. The ARCN website integrates, via a userfriendly interface, resources from multiple sites, including
research profiles and websites of faculty at other institutions, and collaborative research projects.

System implementation
Sal-Site is implemented using a number of open-source
software packages including Apache web server, Perl, CGI,
BioPerl, PHP and MySQL. Sal-Site is hosted on a SMP
(symmetric multi-processor) PC equipped with two processors, 4GB of RAM and running Linux 2.4.x. We use
MySQL 4.0 as the backend Relational Database Management System to store and manage all the information in a
robust and efficient way.

Future directions
Sal-Site is expected to evolve quickly over the next few
years as new research and informational resources are
developed for ambystomatid salamanders. New methodologies have been developed recently to better enable the
system, including the creation of the first transgenic A.
mexicanum (E. Tanaka, personal communication), techniques to alter gene function in vivo [8], and the construc-

tion of an Affymetrix GeneChip (Voss, unpublished data).
Sal-Site will provide databases and informational
resources in support of these and other emerging
resources to foster community efforts and make the
Ambystoma system more accessible to researchers working
in other model systems.
