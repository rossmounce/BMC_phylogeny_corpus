Abstract
Background: The species Azospirillum amazonense belongs to a well-known genus of plant growth-promoting
bacteria. This bacterium is found in association with several crops of economic importance; however, there is a lack
of information on its physiology. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the genomic features of this
species.
Results: Genes of A. amazonense related to nitrogen/carbon metabolism, energy production, phytohormone
production, transport, quorum sensing, antibiotic resistance, chemotaxis/motility and bacteriophytochrome
biosynthesis were identified. Noteworthy genes were the nitrogen fixation genes and the nitrilase gene, which
could be directly implicated in plant growth promotion, and the carbon fixation genes, which had previously been
poorly investigated in this genus. One important finding was that some A. amazonense genes, like the nitrogenase
genes and RubisCO genes, were closer phylogenetically to Rhizobiales members than to species of its own order.
Conclusion: The species A. amazonense presents a versatile repertoire of genes crucial for its plant-associated
lifestyle.

Background
The genus Azospirillum (a-proteobacteria class) encompasses free-living bacteria that can improve the growth
of many economically important plants, mainly cereals
(for an extensive review, see [1]). Therefore, these
microorganisms are considered as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Species of this genus are
widely distributed in nature, living in soils of tropical,
subtropical and temperate regions all over the world.
Several aspects of their physiology seem to be related to
a plant stimulatory effect, notably their ability to synthesize phytohormones. Although these microorganisms
are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, the exact contribution of this process to plant growth is still disputable
[1-3].
So far, fifteen species of the Azospirillum genus have
been described ([4] and references therein). However,

most research efforts have been dedicated to the species
Azospirillum brasilense, neglecting the potential offered
by the biological diversity of this genus.
The bacterium A. amazonense, the focus species of
this study, was initially isolated from forage grasses
grown in the Amazon region. Further studies revealed
its broad ecological distribution, as it is also found in
association with the roots of gramineous plants like rice,
maize, sugarcane and sorghum [5,6]. This species is phylogenetically closer to Azospirillum irakense and Rhodospirillum centenum (also known as Rhodocista
centenaria) than to A. brasilense. Unlike the latter, A.
amazonense can use sucrose as a sole carbon source
and is better adapted to acid environments [6].
In order to access the valuable information that genomic sequences can provide on the physiology of azospirilla, there have been independent efforts by research
groups in sequencing their genomes. Currently, the genomes of three members of the Azospirillum-R. centenum
group are available: Azospirillum sp. B510 [7], A. brasilense Sp245 [8] and R. centenum SW [9]. Although

many years have passed since the discovery of A. amazonense, there is scarce information about this species.
Nevertheless, a recent study under greenhouse conditions showed that especially A. amazonense Y2 (wildtype strain) contributed to the growth of rice plants by
means of biological nitrogen fixation [10], showing its
potential for use as an agricultural inoculant. Therefore,
the objective of our study was to sequence the A. amazonense Y2 genome and to analyze specific regions that
could exert fundamental roles in its survival in the soil
and in its ability to promote plant growth.

Results and Discussion
General features of the A. amazonense draft genome
database

The A. amazonense Y2 presents four replicons with the
following estimated sizes: 2.7 Mbp, 2.2 Mbp, 1.7 Mbp
and 0.75 Mbp [11] The genomic G+C content of A.
amazonense Y2 is 66.89%. The draft genome sequence
consists of 7.044.835 bp divided in 1617 contigs. The
average gene length is 1080. Currently, there are 3319
predicted CDS, where 2299 have sequence similarity to
known genes, 501 are homologs to genes of unknown
function and 519 are hypothetical genes exclusive to A.
amazonense.
Taxonomic features of A. amazonense

In this study, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using
the 16S rDNA sequences from microorganisms belonging to the orders Rhodospirillales and Rhizobiales (Figure 1). The resulting phylogenetic tree clearly shows a
split between these orders. The outermost clade containing all the Azospirillum species divides in two main
subclades: one containing A. amazonense, A. irakense,
Rhodocista pekingensis and R. centenum, and another
containing the other Azospirillum species. This result is
in agreement with previous studies, showing the close
evolutionary relationship between A. amazonense and R.
centenum [12-14], and is also supported by the greater
number of A. amazonense genes (22%) with best BLAST
hits (KEGG Database) to R. centenum genes.
Another relevant feature of the 16S rDNA phylogenetic reconstruction is that R. centenum does not cluster
with other Rhodospirillum species, suggesting that the
genus nomenclature of R. centenum is not appropriate,
as has been pointed out by previous publications [13,15].
Carbon metabolism

Azospirilla display versatile carbon metabolism in order
to support their lives in the soil. A. amazonense is capable of growing on various disaccharides, hexoses and
pentoses and a previous study suggested that A. amazonense is able to catabolize carbohydrates exclusively
through the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (ED pathway)

Page 2 of 14

[16]. The genes encoding the key enzymes of this pathway, 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase and 2-dehydro-3deoxy-phosphogluconate aldolase (KDPG aldolase)
(Additional file 1), were found in the A. amazonense
genome and seem to be organized as an operon. This
same study also suggested that the glycolysis pathway
(Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway) was inoperative in
A. amazonense, because no activity of 6-phosphofructokinase and fructose bisphosphate aldolase was detected
in crude extracts [16]. However, predicted genes encoding those enzymes were found in the A. amazonense
genome (Additional file 1). Therefore, although the
genomic approach indicates that most probably A. amazonense is also able to consume carbohydrates via glycolysis, this catabolic feature should be experimentally retested.
As stated previously, one of the main differences
between A. amazonense and A. brasilense is that A.
amazonense is capable of consuming sucrose as the sole
carbon source [6]. In the genome of A. amazonense, a
predicted gene that codes for a putative a-glucosidase
was identified (Additional file 1). This enzyme converts
sucrose to glucose and fructose, substrates that can be
promptly consumed by catabolic pathways.
The A. amazonense genome also harbors homologs of
the genes salB and salA of A. irakense (Additional file
1). These genes encode b-glucosidases, enzymes implicated in the acquisition of glucose by means of the
hydrolysis of aryl-b-glucosides, such as salicin [17].
Bacteria of the genus Azospirillum produce high levels
of poly-b-hydroxybutyrate (PHB), the energy and carbon
storage source utilized under nutritional stress conditions [2,18]. The essential genes for PHB biosynthesis
are present in the A. amazonense genome: phbA (bketothiolase), phbB (aceto acetyl coenzyme A reductase)
and phbC (PHB synthase) (Additional file 1). Furthermore, the phaZ gene that encodes a PHB depolymerase
(Additional file 1), the first enzyme of the PHB degradation pathway, was also found in its genome.
One of the most surprising features of the A. amazonense genome is the presence of a gene cluster implicated in carbon fixation (the Calvin-Benson-Basham
cycle) (Figure 2 and Additional file 1). The main genes
of this cluster are the genes cbbL and cbbS, and they
encode, respectively, the large and small subunits of
ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (RubisCO). This
enzyme is responsible for the incorporation of carbon
dioxide in a molecule of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate,
generating two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate, which
can subsequently be used in biosynthetic pathways. A
phylogenetic analysis of the concatenated RubisCO
small and large subunits of A. amazonense revealed
that they belong to the Form IC of RubisCOs (Figure
3). This type of enzyme is commonly found in a-

Proteobacteria and it is adapted to environments with
medium to high CO2 and the presence of O2 (in general, RubisCOs also have affinity to O2 and high levels
of this molecule can inhibit CO2 fixation) [19]. So far,
there have been no reports showing that A.

amazonense has autotrophic behavior. However, from
the Azospirillum group, at least R. centenum and A.
lipoferum are known to be capable of growing autotrophically by means of RubisCO [9,20], unlike Azospirillum sp. B510 and A. brasilense Sp245, which do not

cluster of A. amazonense resembles that found in Bradyrhizobium sp. BTAi1, contrasting with the genetic
organization of R. centenum. These incongruities, i.e. the
genetic organization and phylogenetic relationship closer
to Bradyrhizobiaceae members than to R. centenum,
suggests that horizontal gene transfer may be an important driving force in the evolution and dispersion of
RubisCOs in Proteobacteria.

contain Form I or II of RubisCOs ("true” RubisCOs)
encoded in their genomes.
The RubisCO phylogenetic reconstruction also indicated the close relationship of the A. amazonense
enzyme with those from members of the family Bradyrhizobiaceae (order Rhizobiales) (Figure 3), namely Rhodopseudomonas palustris and Bradyrhizobium spp. In
fact, the genetic organization of the carbon-fixation

Azospirillum species are able to utilize distinct nitrogen
sources, including ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, dinitrogen
and amino acids [3,21]. The A. amazonense species has
several genes implicated in nitrogen metabolism, which
encode transporters, enzymes and regulatory proteins
(Additional file 1).
Ammonia is the central compound of nitrogen metabolism and the preferred nitrogen source of many
microorganisms. In general, nitrogen sources other
than ammonia are converted into it to be assimilated
[22]. The A. amazonense genome contains genes that
are implicated in this conversion of alternative nitrogen sources, like nitrate/nitrite, urea and dinitrogen
(Additional file 1). Once available, ammonia can be
incorporated into the metabolism by the glutamine
synthetase (GS)/glutamine:oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GOGAT) pathway, the genes for which are also
encoded in the A. amazonense genome (Additional file
1).

Overall, the conversion of nitrogen compounds to
ammonia expends some energy and, therefore, the metabolic pathways implicated in this process are strictly
regulated to minimize energy waste. The central regulators of nitrogen metabolism are the PII proteins [22,23].
Three PII homolog genes (glnB, glnK and glnK2) were
found in the A. amazonense genome (Additional file 1).
The glnK gene and the glnB gene have ortholog counterparts in Azospirillum sp. B510, A. brasilense Sp245
and R. centenum. The glnK gene is upstream of the aat
gene (aminotransferase) and the glnB is upstream of the
glnA gene (glutamine synthetase) [24]. The third gene,
glnK2, which is located downstream of the amtB gene,
is absent in A. brasilense Sp245, Azospirillum sp. B510
and R. centenum, although this genetic association is
frequently found in diverse prokaryotes [25].
The PII protein interactions with transporters, transcription factors and regulatory enzymes are well-established in the literature (for a review, see [22,23]) and the
potential interaction targets found in the A. amazonense
genome will be briefly discussed. One putative target is
the glnD gene that codes for an uridilyl-transferase, an
enzyme that uridylylates the PII proteins under nitrogen-limiting conditions [23]. Other potential targets
found in the A. amazonense genome are two ammonium transporters, encoded by the amtB genes, which
in the presence of high nitrogen levels are inhibited by
PII proteins [26]. The adenylyltransferase enzyme
(encoded by the glnE gene, Additional file 1) which regulates glutamine synthetase via covalent modifications
[27] could also interact with PII proteins [28].
The analysis of the A. amazonense genome revealed
the presence of the NtrBC and NifA systems (Additional
file 1), which are PII-regulated signal transduction systems responsible for the coordination of genes implicated in the scavenging of alternative nitrogen sources
[23]. Both NtrC and NifA rely on the presence of the
sigma N factor (also known as RpoN, or sigma 54) to
activate the transcription of specific genes [29], which is
also present in the A. amazonense genome (Additional
file 1).
One of the main characteristics of the Azospirillum
species is that they are able to fix nitrogen, i.e. convert
N2 to ammonia, by means of the nitrogenase enzyme
complex. The main genes implicated in this process are
known as nif genes, and they are highly conserved
among nitrogen-fixing proteobacteria [30].
A preliminary BLAST analysis showed that the A.
amazonense nif genes exhibit high similarity with genes
of some species of the order Rhizobiales (Additional file
1). Since these observations were unexpected, the phylogenetic history of nifH was reconstructed utilizing
sequences from species of the orders Rhodospirillales
and Rhizobiales. The resulting nifH tree (Figure 4) was

Page 5 of 14

clearly incongruent to the 16S rDNA tree (Figure 1): in
the nifH tree, A. amazonense and A. irakense grouped
with Bradyrhizobium sp. BTAi1, Xanthobacter diazotrophicus and Azorhizobium caulinodans, instead of grouping with other Azospirillum species.
The genetic organization of the nif genes between the
Rhodospirillales and Rhizobiales bacteria is somewhat
homogeneous (Figure 5). As demonstrated in Figure 5,
some features of the nif cluster of A. amazonense are
exclusively similar to the homolog cluster of the species
Bradyrhizobium sp. BTAi1, such as the presence of
three conserved hypothetical genes that are indicated by
the numbers 2, 5 and 6. On the other hand, Azospirillum sp. B510 and A. brasilense have the aerC gene
between the nifHDK and nifENX operons and the draG
and draT genes in the upstream region of the nifH
gene, features not shared with the nif cluster of A. amazonense. The genes draG and draT code for a posttranslational control system of the nitrogenase, which
are not present in A. amazonense and R. centenum
[9,31].
The domain composition of the deduced NifE and
NifU proteins is also evidence that the nitrogenase complex of A. amazonense is more distantly related to Azospirillum spp. (with the exception of A. irakense) than to
some Rhizobiales species (i.e. those from the genus Bradyrhizobium, Xanthobacter and Azorhizobium). The
NifE protein of A. amazonense (like the Bradyrhizobium,
Xanthobacter and Azorhizobium proteins NifE) has a
bacterioferritin-associated ferredoxin [2Fe-2S] binding
domain (BFD), not present in the NifE protein from A.
brasilense Sp245 and Azospirillum sp. B510, and R.
palustris (Rhizobiales) (Additional file 2). Furthermore,
its NifU protein is smaller than those of A. brasilense
Sp245, Azospirillum sp. B510 and R. palustris CGA009
because it does not contain the BFD and an N-terminal
NifU domain, which are present in the NifU protein of
the latter species (Additional file 2).
Therefore, taken together, these results indicate that
complex events occurred in the evolution of the nitrogenase system in these bacteria, for instance, horizontal
gene transfers and/or gene duplication followed by differential gene loss, culminating in the current distribution of the nif genes among the members of these
taxonomic orders.
Nitrogen fixation is a very energy-demanding process
and it is not surprising that the nitrogenase system is
elaborately regulated. In all diazotrophic species of the
Proteobacteria examined so far, the transcriptional activator NifA and the sigma N alternative RNA polymerase-associated factor are the master regulators of
nitrogen fixation genes [32]. Sequence motifs similar to
the consensus region of sigma N and NifA binding sites
are present upstream of the nifH gene, the homolog of

orf2nifUSVorf4 cluster from A. brasilense [33] and the
nifB gene (Additional file 3).
Energy production and conversion for nitrogen fixation

Nitrogen fixation demands the systematic action of different genes. The fix genes are essential for this process,
and they encompass different functional categories.
These genes were found in the A. amazonense genome
divided into three main clusters, namely fixABCX, fixLJfixK and fixNOQP-fixGHIS.
The fixABCX genes from A. amazonense, responsible
for electron transfer to nitrogenase, are located downstream of the nifW gene (Figure 5). As seen in Figure 5,
this genetic cluster is highly conserved among the analyzed species, and it is tightly associated with the nif
cluster. Putative NifA and sigma N binding sites were
found upstream of the operon fixABCX from A.

amazonense (Additional file 3), indicating that these
transcription factors could be key elements for the
expression of this operon. This evidence is corroborated
by reports showing that the operon fixABCX is regulated
by the NifA protein in A. brasilense and Rhizobium spp.
[34-36].
The A. amazonense genome also possesses a gene
cluster including fixLJ and fixK. In symbiotic diazotrophs, the transcription of fix genes involves the oxygen-responsive FixLJ two-component system. The FixL
protein, in the absence of oxygen, autophosphorylates
and transfers the phosphate group to FixJ. Finally, the
phosphorylated FixJ activates the expression of FixK,
which activates the transcription of genes required for
microaerobic growth [32].
Molecular nitrogen reduction requires high levels of
energy under microaerobic conditions. The fixNOQP
and fixGHIS genes encode membrane-bound

cytochrome c oxidase and the redox process-coupled
cation pump, respectively, which are intimately implicated in respiration under microaerobic conditions, supplying energy for nitrogen fixation [37,38]. These
clusters were found in tandem in the A. amazonense
genome (Additional file 1), and they show identical
organization in many diazotrophic a-Proteobacteria, like
R. centenum, A. brasilense Sp245, R. palustris and Bradyrhizobium spp.
Nitrogen fixation forms molecular hydrogen (H2) as a
byproduct. Therefore, diazotrophic bacteria have several
hydrogenase systems that are responsible for oxidizing
molecular hydrogen to recover part of the energy
expended during nitrogenase activity. Genes encoding
for an uptake NiFe hydrogenase (hupSL) were identified
in A. amazonense (Figure 6). Furthermore, the accessory
proteins required for maturation of the subunits [39,40],
encoded by the hup and hyp genes, are situated downstream of the genes encoding hupSL (Figure 6). This
organization resembles that found in members of the
order Rhizobiales, where, in general, the hup and hyp
genes are clustered (Figure 6), although their ordering is
quite heterogeneous among the species. In contrast with
this observation, comparisons with closely-related species showed that Azospirillum sp. B510 and A. brasilense

Sp245 have their hup and hyp genes scattered across the
genome. Moreover, the bacteria R. centenum does not
have the hydrogenase gene cluster.
An integrated model relating the components discussed in this section with nitrogen metabolism is
depicted in Figure 7, taken into consideration the similarity of A. amazonense genes to those from other wellknown bacterial systems.
Phytohormone production

Species of the Azospirillum genus can positively influence plant growth and crop yield by the biosynthesis
and secretion of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) [2,41]. However, although A. amazonense strains are able to synthesize IAA [10], very little is known about the molecular
mechanisms responsible for this process.
In A. brasilense, at least three pathways for IAA biosynthesis exist, two tryptophan-dependent pathways
(indole-3-acetamide pathway (IAM) and indole-3-pyruvate pathway (IPyA)) and one tryptophan-independent
pathway [3,42]. Similarly, the genome of Azospirillum
sp. B510 contains genes responsible for the IAM pathway [7]. However, the iaaM, iaaH and ipdC genes,
related to the IAM or IPyA pathways, were not located
in the A. amazonense genome. Further analysis of the

Sant’Anna et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:409

genome sequence of A. amazonense revealed a gene
encoding a protein with about 70% similarity to nitrilases from plant species, like Arabidopsis thaliana and
Zea mays, which catalyze the conversion of indole 3acetonitrile to IAA [43,44]. Future studies may verify if
this gene is implicated in IAA biosynthesis in A.
amazonense.
Quorum sensing and biofilm formation

Quorum sensing is an intercellular signaling process
implicated in the regulation of several traits of bacteria,
notably antibiotic biosynthesis and biofilm formation.
The archetype for quorum sensing regulation is the
LuxIR system, which involves an acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) synthase (LuxI homolog) and an AHLdependent transcriptional regulator (LuxR homolog)
[45]. The quorum sensing phenomenon of Azospirillum
species is strain-specific and seems to regulate functions
linked to rhizosphere competence and adaptation to
plant roots [46].
The acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) biosynthesis ability of forty Azospirillum strains (including A. amazonense Y2) was previously investigated, and only four A.
lipoferum strains seemed of being capable of synthesizing these compounds [47]. However, the genome analysis of A. amazonense revealed the presence of genes
encoding for LuxI and LuxR homologs proteins (Additional file 1). Therefore, these results indicate that A.
amazonense Y2 could synthesize AHLs and respond to
its presence in the environment. The genome of A.
amazonense also presents a Klebsiella pneumoniae ahlK
homolog [48], a predicted gene that codes for a putative
homoserine lactonase (Additional file 1) implicated in
AHL degradation. Since bacterial plant pathogens rely
on quorum sensing mechanisms to infect plants [45], a
study of A. amazonense homoserine lactonase activity
on the deleterious activities of these pathogens would be
relevant.
Extracellular polysaccharides are loosely bound to the
cell surface and play an important role in bacteriumplant interactions through the firm and irreversible
anchoring of cells to the plant roots [3]. In the A. amazonense genome, two genes, noeJ (mannose-6-phosphate
isomerase, Additional file 1) and noeL (GDP-mannose
4,6-dehydratase, Additional file 1), which are related to
extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis and biofilm formation, were also found [49].
Chemotaxis/Motility

Different species of Azospirillum attach to and colonize
plant root surfaces and these processes depend on chemotaxis. Azospirilla exhibit chemotaxis towards sugars,
amino acids, organic acids and root exudates [50]. This

Page 9 of 14

ability offers the bacteria the advantage of moving
towards favorable nutrient conditions.
Genes encoding for the central signal transduction
pathway for chemotaxis (che) are present in nearly all
motile bacteria. This signal transduction system is composed of the conserved cheAWYBR genes and a group
of transmembrane chemoreceptors (known as MCPs or
methyl-accepting proteins) that perceive environmental
signals. Homologs of the cheAWYBR and MCP genes
were identified in the A. amazonense genome (Additional file 1), and some che genes display similar organization to those found in the model organism
Escherichia coli [51].
The A. amazonense Che1 gene cluster (cheAWYBR)
revealed a conserved organization with the major chemotaxis gene cluster from A. brasilense Sp245, which
modulates cell length and clumping behavior [52].
Apparently, this gene cluster also affects the production
of exopolysaccharide and flocculation of A. brasilense.
Other che-like genes (Che2 and Che3, Additional file 1)
are present in the A. amazonense genome, probably
encoding parallel signal transduction pathways that
could have distinct functions, similar to those found in
R. centenum [53,54].
It is also worth noting that genes encoding MCP
domain proteins are spread throughout the A. amazonense genome. Some of them were classified accordingly
to their similarities to E. coli chemoreceptors. All five
types of E. coli MCP receptors were found in the A.
amazonense genome (Additional file 1), and it is probable that some of them are related to cell motility by
regulating the histidine kinase CheA that phosphorylates
a response regulator, which in turn controls the rotational direction of the flagellar motor [55].
The flagellum is a key structure for the chemotactic
response. In the A. amazonense genome, 39 flagellar
genes were identified, and the majority of them are distributed among different gene clusters (Additional file
1). The reduced flagellar gene number in A. amazonense
compared to those of the closely-related A. brasilense
(79 annotated genes) and R. centenum (72 genes) species
is in agreement with previous evidence indicating that
A. amazonense synthesizes only the polar flagellum for
swimming motility [56].
Homologs of the A. brasilense and R. centenum genes
fliFHN-motA-flbD-flhAF-fleN [9,57] are present in A.
amazonense (Additional file 1). The A. amazonense genome also contains other flagellar genes that display similar organization to those found in Azospirillum spp. and
R. centenum (Figure 8).
Previous studies demonstrated that the transcription
factor FlbD is related to the biosynthesis of lateral flagella in A. brasilense and the polar flagella in R.

centenum [9,57]. The presence of the flbD gene in the A.
amazonense genome suggests that it could have a similar regulatory function as that found in R. centenum.
Transport, antibiotics resistance and lantibiotic
production

Transport systems allow the uptake of nutrients and
ions, excretion of end products of metabolism and communication between cells and the environment.
Several components of the cationic efflux pump, the
ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter superfamily,
the Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) and the TonBdependent transporters were identified in the A. amazonense genome.
TonB-dependent transport is a mechanism of active
uptake across the outer membrane normally related to
iron uptake, signal transduction and environmental perception [58,59]. A. amazonense has a high number of
genes encoding TonB receptors (Additional file 1) when
compared with other diazotrophs such as Azospirillum
sp. B510 (9 annotated genes) and R. centenum SW (32
annotated genes). Homology analyses suggest that a set
of putative TonB receptors for specific substrates like
ferrioxamine, cobalamin (B12 vitamin) and heme are
present in this bacterium.
Among the different families of transporters, only two
occur ubiquitously in all kingdoms of life: the Major
Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) and the ATP-Binding

Cassette (ABC) superfamily, representing the largest and
most distributed families of transmembrane proteins.
MFS proteins are single polypeptide secondary carriers
that utilize uniport, symport or antiport mechanisms to
transport various small substrates [60]. The ABC transporter proteins utilize energy from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to carry out the uptake of
essential nutrients and/or the extrusion of toxic substances [61]. In the A. amazonense genome, several
genes encoding for putative MFS and ABC transporters
were identified, and they could be implicated in the
transport of a wide range of putative substrates (Additional file 1).
Multidrug resistance (MDR) transporters increase
drug excretion through an efflux pump, which expels a
wide variety of toxic products from the cell, playing a
central role in bacterial drug resistance. The MDR
transporters belong to various transporter families [62].
In E. coli, the transport of diverse substrates out of the
cell by the AcrAB-TolC efflux transporter can confer
broad resistance to antibiotics [63]. The acrA and acrB
genes normally form an operon whose transcription is
regulated by the acrR gene product, and are found in
the A. amazonense genome.
Putative drug resistance transporters of the QacA subfamily were found in the A. amazonense genome (Additional file 1), which could confer resistance to
monovalent and bivalent cationic lipophilic antiseptics

Sant’Anna et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:409
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/409

and disinfectants such as quaternary ammonium compounds [64].
Further analysis revealed that, in addition to the MDR
transporters, a set of genes whose products could be
related to specific antimicrobial resistance are present in
the A. amazonense genome. Genes that code for penicillin, glyoxalase/bleomycin and tetracycline resistance are
also present in the A. amazonense genome (Additional
file 1). These findings corroborate the experimental data
that shows that A. amazonense is tolerant to tetracycline
and resistant to penicillin [6].
Lantibiotics are peptide-derived antibacterial substances produced by some bacteria, and are characterized by the presence of unusual amino acids like
lanthionines and dehydrated amino acids [65]. Lantibiotic biosynthesis is frequently coregulated as part of a
stress response when cells enter the late-log or stationary phase [66]. Most lantibiotics exert their antibiotic
effect by either forming pores in the target cell membrane or by inhibiting cell wall synthesis, and many lantibiotics are bactericidal against a variety of Grampositive bacteria [67]. Genes related to lantibiotic synthesis were found in A. amazonense genome (Additional
file 1).
The genes implicated in antibiotic resistance and in
lantibiotic production are probably essential for successful establishment of this microorganism in the soil due
to constant contact with niche competitors like fungi
and other bacteria.
Bacteriophytochrome

The A. amazonense genome also harbors a bacteriophytochrome gene (Additional file 1). Similarly, Azospirillum sp. B510 has two genes that code for distinct types
of bacteriophytochromes [7], and Bradyrhizobium sp.
possesses three bacteriophytochrome genes [68]. In
plants, phytochromes regulate the metabolic response to
the light environment, but a variety of functions is
found in other organisms [69]. The bacteriophytochromes in R. palustris regulate the biosynthesis of the
photosynthetic apparatus [70], while in Deinococcus
radiodurans and R. centenum, they regulate pigment
biosynthesis [71]. Subsequent studies must be carried
out to understand the role of the bacteriophytochrome
in A. amazonense physiology.

Conclusion
In order to thrive, bacteria must adapt readily to environmental shifts by means of a wide variety of genotypic
and phenotypic accommodations [72]. The rhizosphere
is a good example of a dynamic environment, where
fluctuations in its biological and chemical activities
demand an appropriate response from its inhabitants.
The species A. amazonense is a free-living plant growth-

Page 11 of 14

promoting rhizobacterium that is found in association
with plants of agricultural importance. In this study, we
identified a series of A. amazonense genes that could be
essential for adaptation to the competitive environment
of the rhizosphere. Its wide genetic repertoire confers a
versatile metabolism (e.g. the ability to use different carbon and nitrogen sources), as well as different mechanisms of perceiving and exploring its surroundings. These
characteristics could directly influence plant growth, for
instance, by providing nitrogen and stimulatory compounds to plants. Another important finding was the
greater similarity of some genes, e.g. nitrogenase and
RubisCO genes, to genes of members of the order Rhizobiales than to genes from other Azospirillum species.
This evidence illustrates the genetic plasticity of this
species and indicates that evolutionary phenomena like
horizontal gene transfer could be fundamental for adaptation to its environment.
The major impact of this work will be to guide subsequent studies for a better understanding of the potential
of A. amazonense.

Methods
Bacterial strain, culture conditions, and DNA isolation

A. amazonense Y2 (ATCC 35120) was cultured in M79
medium (10 g/L of sucrose as a carbon source, 0.1 g/L
of K2HPO4, 0.4 g/L of KH2PO4, 0.2 g/L of MgCl2.7H2O,
0.1 g/L of NaCl, 0.4 g/L of yeast extract, pH 6.5) [73]
with shaking at 150 rpm and 35°C for 18 hours. Genomic DNA was isolated as described by Wilson [74]. The
quality of the isolated genomic DNA was assessed by
agarose gel electrophoresis.
Genome sequencing, assembly, draft annotation

Total genomic DNA was sequenced using the Roche 454
pyrosequencing platform following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The contigs were assembled using Newbler
software version 2.3 with the default parameters. The
estimated coverage of the genome was 35x. Some gaps
present in the genes of interest were filled in by sequencing PCR fragments obtained from genomic DNA.
The annotation and analysis of the sequences were
carried out using the System for Automated Bacterial
Integrated Annotation (SABIA) [75]. This Whole Genome Shotgun project has been deposited at DDBJ/
EMBL/GenBank under the accession AFBX00000000.
The version described in this paper is the first version,
AFBX01000000.
Phylogenetic analysis

Gene sequences were retrieved from GenBank. Most of
the 16S rDNA sequences were retrieved from the Ribosomal Database Project [http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/]
[76,77]. The accession numbers of the sequences utilized

Sant’Anna et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:409
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/409

in the phylogenetic reconstructions are listed in Additional file 4.
Multiple sequence alignments were performed using
MUSCLE version 3.8 [78] and CLUSTALW (built into
the MEGA 4 software) [79]. Phylogenetic trees were
inferred using the neighbor-joining method (1000 bootstrap replicates) by the MEGA 4 software [80]. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum
Composite Likelihood method for the nucleotide
sequences and the Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) matrixbased method for the amino acid sequences. All positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated
from the datasets (complete deletion option).
