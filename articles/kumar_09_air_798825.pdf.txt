Abstract
Background: Large multigene sequence alignments have over recent years been increasingly
employed for phylogenomic reconstruction of the eukaryote tree of life. Such supermatrices of
sequence data are preferred over single gene alignments as they contain vastly more information
about ancient sequence characteristics, and are thus more suitable for resolving deeply diverging
relationships. However, as alignments are expanded, increasingly numbers of sites with misleading
phylogenetic information are also added. Therefore, a major goal in phylogenomic analyses is to
maximize the ratio of information to noise; this can be achieved by the reduction of fast evolving
sites.
Results: Here we present a batch-oriented web-based program package, named AIR that allows
1) transformation of several single genes to one multigene alignment, 2) identification of
evolutionary rates in multigene alignments and 3) removal of fast evolving sites. These three
processes can be done with the programs AIR-Appender, AIR-Identifier, and AIR-Remover (AIR),
which can be used independently or in a semi-automated pipeline. AIR produces user-friendly
output files with filtered and non-filtered alignments where residues are colored according to their
evolutionary rates. Other bioinformatics applications linked to the AIR package are available at the
Bioportal http://www.bioportal.uio.no, University of Oslo; together these greatly improve the
flexibility, efficiency and quality of phylogenomic analyses.
Conclusion: The AIR program package allows for efficient creation of multigene alignments and
better assessment of evolutionary rates in sequence alignments. Removing fast evolving sites with
the AIR programs has been employed in several recent phylogenomic analyses resulting in
improved phylogenetic resolution and increased statistical support for branching patterns among
the early diverging eukaryotes.

Background
A well-resolved phylogenetic tree demonstrating the relationships between species is one of the most important
goals in evolutionary biology, and the fundament for
comparative studies in many fields in life science. Multiple gene sequence data is increasingly being used to
resolve phylogenetic relationships, and frequently more
than 50 genes are being inferred to address key questions
about the early evolution of eukaryotes [1-8]. Recent studies have for instance shown support for the grouping of
known eukaryotes into a handful of supergroups [2,5,915]. The main reason for constructing multigene data
instead of using single gene data in phylogenetic reconstruction is to collect enough information to improve the
phylogenetic signal [9,16]. Accordingly, as the number of
genes increases, the tendency is that phylogenetic relationships are better resolved and receive higher statistical
support [2,5,16-18]. However, simply adding genes to an
alignment to increase statistical support does not necessarily lead to more accurate results; inconsistencies in
datasets may adversely lead to higher support for an incorrect topology. Reducing such stochastic errors is an important step in improving the phylogenetic resolution of the
sequence data [16,19-21]. Consistency in the data may be
improved by the removal of the fastest evolving sites; as
such sites may have over-representation of substitution
saturation causing homoplasies [22,23]. However, so far
only a few bioinformatics program has been reported that
allows for the concatenation of multiple single gene alignment files, identification of fast evolving sites and
removal of fast evolving sites in accordance with the users
needs.
Here we present a bioinformatics package, named AIR
that combines all these possibilities. AIR is divided into
three applications: AIR-Appender, AIR-Identifier and AIRRemover (Figure 1). AIR-Appender performs separate
processing of data by appending single gene alignment
files to a multi-gene alignment. AIR-Identifier identifies
fast evolving sites by calculating site-rates, and AIRRemover removes fast evolving sites from an alignment.
The AIR programs are interlinked with other applications
useful in the field of phylogenomics (i.e., multi-gene
BLAST, contig assembly of Sanger and 454 sequences,
alignment and phylogeny) through the Bioportal at the
University of Oslo.

Implementation
The AIR package is implemented on the Bioportal at the
University of Oslo. The Bioportal is a web-based bioinformatics service freely available to academic users at the following URL: http://www.bioportal.uio.no/. The Bioportal
uses SQL for maintaining information about users, files,
databases, and jobs. The Bioportal resources are deployed
on Linux with Apache HTTP server 2.2. The critical scripts

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/357

to maintain the Bioportal, e.g. cron jobs scripts and postprocessing scripts, are written in Perl v5.8, and python 2.3.
The web-interface for all available applications on Bioportal is written in PHP 4.3.
Each user of the Bioportal has access to several file directories and file administration functions. All files used as
input for analyses are stored in project folders defined by
the users. Once the user has created a project folder they
can upload data-files into its respective project folders.
The user can then use the web interface created for each
application on Bioportal to select their files, applications
(here for example AIR-Appender, AIR-Identifier, or AIRRemover) and parameter settings. For each analysis a
working folder is created in the working directory 'job
admin'. A 'copy home' function in the 'job admin' can be
used to transfer files from working directories to project
folders; hence result files from one process can be used as
input files in subsequent analyses, and to link different
applications in a semi-automated pipeline. For instance,
alignments made by MAFFT [24] can be used for phylogenetic analyses by one of the available phylogenetic programs e.g. RAxML, Treefinder or MrBayes [25-27]. The
Bioportal tutorial is available at the Bioportal website.
All successfully submitted Bioportal jobs are run in the
background, the execution time of each process varies
dependent on the file size and the nature of the selected
applications. To keep track of the status of submitted jobs
a manager module has been developed on the Bioportal;
this updates the users about the current status of all jobs.
Upon completion the results are returned to the respective
working directory where files can then be downloaded in
a compressed 'zip' format.
Currently the Bioportal is the largest high performancecomputing environment in Norway. The available computer resources are 320 dedicated cores on the TITAN cluster at the University of Oslo. In addition, the Bioportal has
access to all free or idle TITAN cores if needed (4000 at
present). The TITAN cluster has LINUX nodes with 16
gigabytes of memory and 2× quadcore CPUs or 2× dualcore CPUs.

Results
Appending single gene alignments
AIR-Appender merges multiple single gene alignment files
into one major multigene alignment; the program looks
for species with identical names and subsequently merges
these. If any of the single gene alignments are lacking taxa
in relation to one another, the program will automatically
replace the missing data with question marks '?'. The junction between genes will be marked with double hyphen
for easy identification of the sequence borders. The resulting output of AIR-Appender is a single FASTA and PAML

colored boxes depict input files (red), output files (green), and the AIR programs (Blue). Texts in Italics depict the filename and
respective extension of output files of AIR programs. A) AIR-Appender uses several single gene alignments for construction of
a multigene alignment. B) AIR-Identifier uses the output file from AIR-Appender and file containing one or more phylogenetic
trees for calculating site rates and rate categories. C. AIR-Remover deletes fast evolving sites according to settings defined by
the user. The output files from each of the AIR programs can be used in subsequent analysis by copying the files from the work
directory to project folder on the Bioportal using the copy home function. Five main output files are produced by AIR. In which
two are graphical html files with information about site rates and fast evolving sites (rates.html), and sites removed from the
alignment (outfile.html). File 'rates.html' shows the rate categories as different colors (up to 8 categories), while 'outfile.html'
shows the removed sites in red color (e.g. category 7 and 8 removed are shown in red), and rest sites in blue. Files namely
'rates' and 'out.ctl' are produced by PAML programs, which are implemented in AIR-Identifier. While 'outfile.ali' is the multigene
alignment with fast evolving sites removed.

formatted file containing the multiple gene alignment
(out.fasta in Figure 1); this can be used for downstream
processing with AIR-Identifier (or other programs available on the Bioportal) or downloaded to a local computer
as a compressed zip file.
Identifying site rate
After the user has made the multi-gene sequence file,
site-rates (i.e. posterior mean values) can then be identified for nucleotides, codons and amino acids sequences
with the program AIR-Identifier. AIR-Identifier applies
the PAML programs codeml (for codon and amino acid
sequences) and baseml (for nucleotide sequences)
[28,29]. The control file (out.ctl in Figure 1) is critical as
it is here that the user defines a set of parameters to be
used for estimation of site rates by codeml or baseml.
These programs are usually only available via the command line, and thus setting parameters for a successful

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/357

run can be a cumbersome task. We have therefore developed AIR-Identifier as a user-friendly web interface for
the PAML programs; here the users can define the parameters and their respective values (Figure 2). For instance,
the evolutionary model for calculation of site-rates, and
the number of rate categories (normally 8 categories) for
the analysis can be defined. Users still have an option to
use their own control file that can be uploaded to the
Bioportal.
Two types of files are used to calculate the site rates: 1) a
multigene alignment in FASTA format with file extension
'.fasta' or PAML format, and 2) a corresponding file containing a phylogenetic tree. The tree file should be generated with a suitable phylogenetic programs; the codeml
and baseml programs are not recommended to reconstruct trees (see the PAML manual [30]). The tree topologies accepted are typically specified using the parenthesis

codons, and amino acids. The sequence files can be in FASTA or PAML format, while single or multiple trees in the tree file
must be in Newick format and supplied in a single file.

notation such as the Newick tree format [31]. It should be
noted that some widely used programs such as PAUP or
MacClade [32,33] can produce tree files with limited compatibility, whereas other programs such as PHYLOBAYES
v. 2.3 [34] or RAxML-VI-HPC [27] generate output files
that are ready to use. Trees with or without branch length
are accepted by AIR-Identifier.
It can often be difficult to decide which phylogeny should
be used for estimating rates, especially when a dataset
gives differing trees from different evolutionary models,
parameters and tree searching algorithms. It has also been
proposed that the selection of phylogeny can have a major
impact on rate estimation [21]. For this reason we have
constructed the AIR-Identifier to calculate site rates and
rate categories from multiple phylogenetic trees.
The AIR-Identifier program produces two output files: 1)
A rate file, which contains information about the evolutionary rate (rate category) for each site in the alignment
(rates in Figure 1); 2) A html file (i.e. rates.html in Figure
1) that visually presents information about the rate pattern in the alignment and which allow the users to easily
evaluate the importance of the various rate categories and
the dispersal of the site rates along the alignment before
sites are removed; the file also includes an graphical overview of the alignment where different rate categories have
been color-coded.
Removing fast evolving sites
AIR-Remover is developed for the removal of fast evolving
sites. The sites can be removed based on either site-rate or
rate-category. The AIR-remover uses the alignment file
and respective rates file obtained as output from AIR-Identifier. The users can then decide which of the rates and categories of fastest evolving sites should be removed.
Multiple categories can be removed by using comma-separated numbers. The users can also remove sites that correspond to a fraction of the fastest evolving sites by
defining a percentage of the total rate distribution; it is
possible to remove e.g. the 5% fastest evolving sites (Figure 3). The AIR-Remover output files produces a main
result file containing the ready to use alignment file (outfile.ali in Figure 1) and an html file (outfile.html in Figure
1) that enables the users to visualize the removed sites
colored in red within their alignment.

Discussion and conclusion
The AIR package has been extensively used in recently
published phylogenomic studies of deeply diverging
eukaryote lineages [2,18]. In the study of Burki et al.,
2008, a global eukaryote phylogeny was reconstructed
from a dataset of 135 genes and 65 taxa, resulting in 73%
bootstrap support for a single "megagroup" comprising
nearly all photosynthetic lineages (including the super-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/357

groups Plantae, chromalveoalates and Rhizaria). When
the fast evolving sites were identified and removed from
the alignment with AIR, the same topology was recovered
but with a substantially increased bootstrap support
(97%) for the observed relationship. In the study of
Minge et al. 2008, the evolutionary position of an enigmatic lineage named Breviata was in question using 78
genes and 38 taxa. The lineage was placed with strong
bootstrap support as sister to the supergroup Amoebozoa,
however statistical testing i.e. AU-test [35] of alternative
placements in the eukaryote tree could not reject a sister
relationship to another supergroup, the Excavata. Once
fast evolving sites were removed using AIR the AU test
could reject an affinity to the Excavata and additionally
placed Breviata with the Amoebozoa with higher bootstrap support. Interestingly, the removal of additional fast
evolving sites (altogether the 3 fastest rate categories)
reduced the bootstrap support for the monophyly of Breviata and Amoebozoa, thus suggesting that the removal of
too many categories or sites can reduce relevant phylogenetic information in the data. It demonstrates the need for
detailed information about rates in the alignment provided by AIR.
The great need for efficient bioinformatic tools in reconstructing multi-gene alignments for phylogenomic inferences has over the last years been met by several new
applications, such as Concatenator, IDEA, SCaFoS, IDEA
and ASAP [36-40]. Several of these have overlapping functionalities with the AIR package, but the AIR is unique in
combining key steps for constructing multi-gene alignments and evolutionary rate estimations. Most importantly AIR allows trimming of alignments according to the
evolutionary rates and the users' preferences. Site rates
estimation can be based on multiple phylogenies that
account for uncertainties in the phylogeny. Several different criterions can be used for removing sites, either based
on rate categories or site rates, which reduces the possibility of removing too many or few sites from the alignment.
Monitoring of the site removal process is easy by using the
colored alignment output files from the AIR.
In contrast to the vast majority of other programs, the AIR
package is easily accessible on the web and does not
require cumbersome installation on local computers. AIR
is implemented on the Bioportal where users have their
own file directories and can access several widely used
programs in molecular evolution and ecology. The result
files from the AIR programs can also be easily downloaded and applied in downstream analyses at other webbased bioinformatics services (such as http://
www.phylo.org and http://bioweb2.pasteur.fr/). This
makes the AIR package user-friendly and efficient. As AIR
will process files on a large computer cluster, with the
prospect of being linked to a larger grid infrastructure in
