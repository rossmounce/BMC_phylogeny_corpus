Abstract
Background: Flesh flies in the genus Sarcophaga are important models for investigating
endocrinology, diapause, cold hardiness, reproduction, and immunity. Despite the prominence of
Sarcophaga flesh flies as models for insect physiology and biochemistry, and in forensic studies, little
genomic or transcriptomic data are available for members of this genus. We used massively parallel
pyrosequencing on the Roche 454-FLX platform to produce a substantial EST dataset for the flesh
fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis. To maximize sequence diversity, we pooled RNA extracted from whole
bodies of all life stages and normalized the cDNA pool after reverse transcription.
Results: We obtained 207,110 ESTs with an average read length of 241 bp. These reads assembled
into 20,995 contigs and 31,056 singletons. Using BLAST searches of the NR and NT databases we
were able to identify 11,757 unique gene elements (E<0.0001) representing approximately 9,000
independent transcripts. Comparison of the distribution of S. crassipalpis unigenes among GO
Biological Process functional groups with that of the Drosophila melanogaster transcriptome suggests
that our ESTs are broadly representative of the flesh fly transcriptome. Insertion and deletion
errors in 454 sequencing present a serious hurdle to comparative transcriptome analysis. Aided by
a new approach to correcting for these errors, we performed a comparative analysis of genetic
divergence across GO categories among S. crassipalpis, D. melanogaster, and Anopheles gambiae. The
results suggest that non-synonymous substitutions occur at similar rates across categories,
although genes related to response to stimuli may evolve slightly faster. In addition, we identified
over 500 potential microsatellite loci and more than 12,000 SNPs among our ESTs.
Conclusion: Our data provides the first large-scale EST-project for flesh flies, a much-needed
resource for exploring this model species. In addition, we identified a large number of potential
microsatellite and SNP markers that could be used in population and systematic studies of S.
crassipalpis and other flesh flies.

Background
Flesh flies in the genus Sarcophaga (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) have long been important models in insect physiology and biochemistry, particularly with respect to the
study of endocrinology [1,2], diapause [3,4], cold hardiness [5,6], reproduction [7,8], and immunity [9]. Larvae
of Sarcophaga flies typically feed on carrion or feces, playing an important ecological role in decomposition and
feature prominently in human forensic studies [10,11].
Sarcophaga species can cause myiasis in humans and livestock and therefore are of importance to medical and veterinary entomology [12]. In addition, Sarcophaga flies are
natural hosts of the parasitic wasp Nasonia vitripennis and
are often used in laboratory studies and for wasp culture.
Nasonia vitripennis parasitizes pupae of many species of
higher flies, including house flies and other filth flies,
making them economically important for biological control [13]. Furthermore, N. vitripennis is a popular model
for understanding host-parasite relationships, behavioral
ecology, development, and evolution, thus offering an
impetus for sequencing the genome of this wasp and two
congeners N. giraulti and N. longicornis [14-16].
Despite its prominence as a model in several sub-disciplines, there is currently no genome project for any Sarcophaga species, and genomic resources are limited.
Several laboratories have performed low-throughput EST
projects such as differential display [17] and subtractive
hybridization [18], but the mainstay of functional
genomic research on species in this genus has focused on
homology-based, gene-by-gene cloning. The genomic
resources developed for a handful of insects including
Drosophila, honey bees, mosquitoes, and Bombyx mori has
prompted much work on these species, pushing our
understanding of processes in these few models far ahead
of other insects. Development of such resources for Sar-

cophaga would greatly benefit the study of flesh flies as has
been done with other non-traditional model insects such
as Polistes wasps [19], Glanville fritillary butterflies [20],
and tobacco hornworm moths [21].
We describe an EST collection developed as a genomic
resource for the flesh fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis, a model
species for studying numerous processes including diapause, reproduction, endocrinology, stress tolerance, and
immunity. To facilitate identifying sets of genes involved
in a broad range of processes we developed our EST set
from a normalized whole-body library of numerous S.
crassipalpis life stages including diapause-destined and
non diapause-destined larvae, diapausing and non-diapausing pupae, and reproductive and non-reproductive
adults of both sexes (Table 1). We confidently identified
approximately 9,000 different transcripts involved in
numerous biological processes. Within these transcripts,
we identified more than 500 potential microsatellite loci
and over 12,000 SNPs that can be used for future population studies. Comparison of the distribution of S. crassipalpis unigenes among GO Biological Process functional
groups with that of the Drosophila melanogaster transcriptome suggests that our ESTs are broadly representative of
the flesh fly transcriptome. Combining our data with full
transcriptomes from D. melanogaster and A. gambiae, we
used a three-species comparison to test whether coding
sequences are evolving at similar rates across these GO
categories.

Results and discussion
Our normalized S. crassipaplis library was first subjected to
a one-quarter plate titration run on the 454 GS-FLX
machine that yielded 1,512,233 total bases from 5,727
sequence reads that assembled into 554 contigs and 3,182
singletons. Of these contigs and singletons 1,465 were

identifiable at an E ≤ 0.001 using BLASTX against the
NCBI non-redundant protein database (NR).
We followed this one-quarter plate preliminary run with a
full-plate production run that yielded 72,816,811 total
bases from 281,537 sequence reads and combined the
results of both runs into a single dataset which was assembled de novo. Files containing our results are available
from the National Center for Biotechnology Information
Short Read Archive (accession numbers SRR005065 and
SRR006884). After filtering adaptors and low-quality
sequences [22] we were left with 74,329,044 total bases
from 207,110 sequence reads with an average length of
241 bases. These data were assembled into 20,995 contigs
with a mean length of 332 bp and a range of 30 to 2,958
bp as well as an additional 31,056 singletons for a total of
52,051 high-quality sequences. A file of all assembled
contigs and singletons is available from the authors upon
request.
Subjecting these sequences to a BLASTX search against the
NCBI-NR protein database yielded 19,609 well-identified
sequences with at least one hit E ≤ 0.0001 (37%), 15,241
poorly-identified sequences with hits between E = 0.0001
and E = 10, and 32,433 with no useful hits (E>10). Subjecting these sequences to a BLASTN search against the
NCBI-NT sequence database yielded 6,321 well-identified
sequences with a hit E ≤ 0.0001 (12%), 44,268 poorlyidentified sequences with hits between E = 0.0001 and E
= 10, and 1,453 with no useful hits (E>10). Well-identified sequences (E<0.001) from both searches were combined and compared with each other using BLASTN,
reducing the number of well-identified sequences into
11,757 unique gene elements or unigenes. To estimate
how many of these unigenes represented unique transcripts as opposed to different non-contiguous fragments
of the same transcript we produced a file of the top 50 hits
for each unigene and used these lists to compare accession
numbers that overlapped among different unigenes with
an E<0.001 using a custom Excel macro followed by manual editing. This procedure identified 9,317 sequences
that are likely independent transcripts (Table 2).
While the ~9,000 identified transcripts are certainly less
than the entire transcriptome, we acquired many
sequences of interest. Because our groups, among others,
are particularly interested in diapause and stress biology,
we compiled a brief list of genes we expect play a role in
diapause (Additional file 1). Clearly, even this abbreviated list will provide fodder for years of functional genomics work on these candidate genes for our group and
others.
Our major goal was to generate a substantial representative sample of the transcriptome. To assess whether our

EST project was broadly representative of our expectations
for the Sarcophaga transcriptome, we used the annotations
for each of our contigs and singletons to assign it to one
of 14 major GO categories for Biological Process, producing assignments for 9,468 out of a total 52,051 transcripts
(Fig. 1). We also compared the distribution of our
sequences among these 14 GO functional groups within
Biological Process to the distribution of the 15,183 predicted genes for Drosophila melanogaster, 5,053 of which
are placed into those same functional groups (Fig. 2, FlyBase, version 2008_07). Although there are noticeable differences between the Drosophila and Sarcophaga data in the
percentage of transcripts within a few sub-categories, concordance in the overall distributions suggests that our
library sampled widely across sub-categories and provides
a good representation of the S. crassipalpis transcriptome.
As sequencing technologies improve, further exploration
of the S. crassipalpis transcriptome will likely include
sequencing of new libraries made from key tissues during
focal life stages that may not have high representation in
total body extracts, such as brains from diapausing pupae
or ovaries from pre and post-reproductive females, as well
as deeper sequencing to both reveal rare transcripts and
provide the additional information necessary to identify
more of the unannotated transcript fragments in our current whole-body library.
Because our EST database appears broadly representative
of the S. crassipalpis transcriptome, we compared it to the
available transcriptomes of D. melanogaster and A. gambiae
to assess whether coding sequences were evolving at
equivalent rates across GO categories. Non-synonymous
rates of substitution (dN) were roughly gamma-distributed across genes within each GO category for all three
pairwise comparisons. Median values across all GO categories were generally lowest in comparisons of S. crassipalpis to D. melanogaster (Fig. 3), reflecting their close
relationship within Cyclorrapha relative to the relatively
deep phylogenetic split between Cyclorrapha and Culicomorpha. The 95% confidence intervals of the median
(notches in Fig. 3) did not differ substantially across categories within any of the three pairwise comparisons (similarly shaded bars in Fig. 3), suggesting largely

homogeneous rates of amino acid substitution. However,
the median dN for Response to stimuli had the highest
(D. melanogaster to A. gambiae; S. crassipalpis to A. gambiae)
or second highest (S. crassipalpis to D. melanogaster) value
in the rank ordering among GO categories across all three
pairwise comparisons. This consistently high dN across
multiple comparisons of species diverged on the order of
200 million years ago [23] suggests that genes regulating
responses to stimuli may evolve relatively rapidly across
dipteran taxa. This divergence meshes well with obvious
differences in sensory strategies between these three species that must identify and locate very different nutritional
resources (rotting flesh, live animals for blood meals, and
rotting fruit). In addition, responses to pheromonal and
behavioural cues associated with reproduction vary
widely across taxa and are likely under strong diversifying
selection.

In addition to the focal animal, transcriptomics projects
can also provide insights into parasites, pathogens, and
other associated microorganisms. Because we used whole
organisms grown in non-sterile culture conditions we
expected a portion of our library to include microorganismal sequences, some which are directly associated with S.
crassipalpis and some that are inadvertent environmental
contaminants. We identified only 160 non-metazoan
sequences that appeared to be independent transcripts
with an E<0.0001 from our BLASTX and BLASTN
searches. Although we expect that flesh flies have a rich
microorgansimal community, our selection of poly-A
RNA as the starting material for our library likely eliminated many potential microbial sequences. Few hits were
ascribed to any single microorganismal taxa. Roughly
one-third of the sequences had high sequence similarity
to various eukaryotic microorganisms including yeasts

(e.g., Candida, Saccharomyces), filamentous fungi (e.g.,
Aspergillus, Neurospora), and protozoans (e.g., Plasmodium,
Theileria). Sequences having apparent bacterial origin
included many genera with species that have been associated with insects either as pathogens or as normal flora in
the gut (e.g., Burkholderia and Escherichia), but these
sequences could just as easily represent environmental
contamination. Perhaps most interesting of the nonmetazoan sequences were those for transposable elements, particularly sequences in the Mariner-Tc1 family
and several retroviral elements. With future development
such sequences may provide insight into new functional
genomics tools for Sarcophaga, potentially including
transgenic modification.
Another interesting feature of our 454 sequence data is
that a number of sequences appear to contain repeat
motifs (i.e., microsatellites) or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We searched for microsatellite motifs
within our sequences using the program MSATCOMMANDER [24] to identify sequences with di-, tri-, tetra-,
penta, and hexanucleotide repeats. Our search for repeat
motifs revealed 521 sequences containing some such
motif from the total set of 52,053 sequences (using a minimum repeat length of seven, Additional file 2). The high
levels of variation typically found for microsatellite markers have led to their widespread use for a broad range of

studies such as genome mapping, parentage analysis, and
analyses of gene flow and genetic structure. Because our
library was constructed from a long-standing laboratory
colony expected to harbor little standing variation compared to field populations, we did not screen any of these
loci for allelic variability. Similarly, to identify SNPs in our
contigs we used the program PolyBayesShort, a version of
the PolyBayes program [25] that has been optimized for
data from short read platforms such as 454, under the
default parameters. We found at total of 12,090 SNPs that
were distributed among 3436 of our 20,995 contigs, yielding an average of 7.23 SNPs per 10 kb. However, because
our samples were derived from a long-standing, inbred
laboratory colony our SNP estimates are likely a small
fraction of the variation existing in S. crassipalpis populations in the field. We hope that identification of candidate
microsatellite and SNP loci will be useful for others interested in field-based population studies of S. crassipalpis
and closely related Sarcophaga species, some of which are
important for forensic studies.

Conclusion
Studies of flesh flies in the genus Sarcophaga have contributed greatly to our understanding of diapause, stress
resistance, reproduction, and immunity in insects, but
work in this "non-traditional" model organism has been
hampered by a lack of genomic resources. Our use of
pyroseqencing to develop a new EST library containing
approximately 9,000 transcripts provides a new resource
for innovative work that we hope will draw renewed interest in using flesh flies as a model. We expect that these EST
data will provide the foundation for a proliferation of
functional work on flesh flies including "-omics"
approaches such as the development of microarrays for
large scale gene expression studies as well as serving as a
foundation for identifying previously unrecognizable proteins in proteomics studies. These data will also increase
our ability to explore specific gene and pathway-based
approaches such as transcript quantification by qRT-PCR
and RNA interference of candidate genes that have previously been refractory to homology-based cloning. Furthermore, these data compliment the growing number of
EST and genome projects in flies other than Drosophila and
mosquitoes, such as the medfly Ceratitis capitata and the
Hessian fly Mayetiola destructor [26,27], enhancing
resources for comparative studies of molecular evolution
across the Diptera. Our initial comparative analysis of
evolutionary rates across GO categories illustrates this
utility, and we anticipate that similar genome and transcriptome-wide analyses will yield important insights into
insect diversification.

tory for nearly 8 years before the onset of this project.
Non-diapausing pupae were obtained by rearing the colony under long-day conditions (15L:9D) with adults held
at 25°C and larvae and pupae at 20°C, whereas diapausing pupae were generated by rearing the maternal generation of adults, larvae and pupae under short-day
conditions (12L:12D) with adults held at 25°C and larvae
and pupae held at 20°C, as previously described [28].
We created a single normalized cDNA library from all life
stages to maximize representation of the S. crassipalpis
transcriptome. Because we are particularly interested in
pupal diapause and reproduction, we included both diapause-destined and direct developing individuals, and
among adults we included both protein-fed and proteinstarved males and females sampled from eclosion
through one reproductive bout (see Table 1 for full sampling scheme). RNA from each sample group was
extracted separately in Tri-reagent (Ambion) and the quality of total RNA was verified on 1.4% agarose-MOPS-formaldehyde denaturing gels. Poly-A RNA was extracted
from each total RNA sample using the Oligotex® mRNA
Midi Kit (Qiagen) and the quality again verified on a
denaturing gel. Because the total mRNA yield from each
pool differed, 1 μg of mRNA from each sample group was
combined into a single large pool and mixed well. This
single large, equally-mixed pool was the source of starting
material for the creation of the normalized cDNA library.
An initial cDNA library was constructed using the SMART
cDNA Synthesis Kit (BD Clonetech, Mountain View, CA)
and normalized using the Trimmer-Direct Kit (Evrogen,
Moscow). The quality of the normalized cDNA library was
checked on a 1.4% agarose gel.
Approximately 2.5 μg of the normalized cDNA pool was
used for a titration run using one quarter of a plate on the
Roche GS FLX sequencer and was followed by a whole
plate run on the same equipment using 15 μg of cDNA
and a full GS FLX plate at the Interdisciplinary Center for
Biotechnology Research at the University of Florida (UFICBR). The pyroluminescence intensity for each beadcontaining well was used to determine base calls for each
nucleotide incorporation step. Sequence assembly was
performed first using the Newbler Assembler v1.1.02.15
(454 Life Science, Branford, CT). Afterwards, Newbler
output, including all contigs and singletons, was subjected to a second assembly step using the Paracel Transcript Assembler v3.0.0 (Paracel Inc., Pasadena, CA).
Sequences were masked for oligonucleotide adaptors used
in SMART cDNA synthesis and normalization using a
threshold of 15. Low-quality data (base call score < 10)
was trimmed from the ends of individual sequences. Low
complexity sequence regions (simple sequence repeats)
were identified and excluded from consideration during
initial pair-wise comparison, but were included during

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/234

final alignment and consensus building. Assembly was
performed in two stages. The first stage used the "Haste"
algorithm to build groups (or clusters) of sequences sharing a minimal amount of identifiable sequence similarity
(threshold = 50). The second stage assembled sequences
within individual clusters into consensus transcripts using
the software defaults, except parameters MinCovRep
(500), InOverhang (30), EndOverhang (30), RemOverhang (30), QualSumLim (300), MaxInternalGaps (15)
and PenalizeN (0). For our dataset, an advantage of the
second assembly step using Paracel Transcript Assembler
was in cleaning-up the data by further masking any
SMART adaptor sequences or poly-A stretches that were
included in the initial Newbler assembly.
All contigs and singlets were annotated by BLAST search
against NCBI NR and NT databases where the e-value
threshold was set at 1e-4. For each query sequence, the top
100 BLAST hits were obtained if available and stored in
BlastQuest [29]. If a BLAST hit represented a NCBI Gene
database entry, it was used to map Sarcophaga transcripts
to putative homologs from Drosophila, human, mouse,
zebrafish, dog or other organisms. Gene Ontology (GO)
annotations were also derived based on sequence similarity. Transcripts were classified into 14 major Gene Ontology categories under biological process. If a transcript was
annotated with more than one GO category it was split
equally among them.
We also used our GO annotations to assess whether coding sequence divergence within Diptera is relatively
homogenous across GO categories. We obtained full
translation databases for D. melanogaster and A. gambiae
from FlyBase http://flybase.org/ and VectorBase http://
www.vectorbase.org/, respectively. We then used our S.
crassipalpis EST database as a query in a BlastX search
against each of these additional databases setting the evalue threshold to 1 × 10-4 and using default values for all
other parameters. The 454 sequencing technology is
prone to producing apparent frame-shift errors via erroneous insertions or deletions of extra bases [30], limiting the
quality and length of codon alignments and blastX hits.
Without correction, codons and proteins will align in
overlapping, frame-shifted segments, and to our knowledge no pyrosequencing study has previously addressed
this issue. We developed a procedure to identify and correct for 454 insertion (overcall) and deletion (undercall)
errors including the following steps: 1) Identify BlastX hits
with two frame-shifted, overlapping High-scoring Segment Pairs (HSPs) both with e-values less than 1 × 10-5 (if
present, we excluded additional, higher e-value HSPs
from our alignments). 2) Determine protein alignment
score for each HSP in the region of overlap. We calculated
alignment scores by assigning a value of 1 for identical residues, 0.5 for a positive alignment score in the

Page 7 of 9

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:234

BLOSUM62 scoring matrix, and 0 for non-positive
BLOSUM62 scores or a gap. 3) Retain the region of overlap in the HSP alignment with the highest alignment
score, and remove the region of overlap from both the unaligned nucleotide and aligned protein sequence of the
lower scoring HSP. 4) Remove one or two additional
nucleotides past the region of overlap in the un-aligned
nucleotide sequence for the lower-scoring HSP if the
frameshift is +1 or +2, respectively. These are nucleotides
in the 5' or 3' direction if the lower scoring HSP is more 5'
or 3', respectively. 5) Insert a single gap in the query protein sequence at the 3' end of the first HSP (or the 5' end
of the second HSP) if the frameshift is +2. 6) Concatenate
the highest scoring HSP (protein) with the lowest scoring,
truncated HSP. The procedure corrects for single insertion
and deletion errors to produce the best scoring full alignment based on our scoring criteria for the region of overlap. In the case of an insertion (+1 frameshift) error, a
single nucleotide is removed in the correction. In the case
of a deletion (+2 frameshift) two nucleotides are removed
and a gap in the protein sequence is introduced. This
effectively removes a codon from the alignment, reflecting
the uncertainty in reconstructing the translated amino
acid associated with the deletion. Out of 12,321 total
blastX hits from a Sarcophaga to Drosophila translation
database search, 1036 (8 percent) had putative frame-shift
errors, 681 +1 (insertion) shifts and 355 +2 (deletion)
shifts. Clearly correcting these frame-shift errors will substantially improve genome-wide alignments using any
454-derived transcriptome.
After applying frame-shift corrections, we retained the
top-scoring amino acid alignment from each BlastX hit
and produced the associated transcript alignments using
tranalign in the EMBOSS package [31] in conjunction
with transcription databases for D. melanogaster and A.
gambiae. Using the program YN00 from the PAML package
[32] we estimated synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dN) substitution rates for each alignment via the
method of Yang and Nielsen [33]. Our initial intention
was to estimate dN/dS ratios, but alignments were largely
oversaturated with synonymous substitution rates (often
inestimable). Thus, we retained only dN estimates.
Finally, we estimated the median, interquartile range
(IQR), and an estimate of the 95% confidence interval of
the median as ± 1.58 IQR/sqrt(n) for dN values from each
GO category (genes falling into more than one GO category contribute to estimates in all associated categories).
This particular 95% CI estimate provides a confidence
interval that is largely insensitive to the underlying distribution [34]. We also performed all of the above steps on
the pairwise comparison between D. melanogaster and A.
gambiae, yielding three pairwise comparisons in the complete analysis.
