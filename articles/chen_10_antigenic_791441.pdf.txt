circulating in China

Abstract
Background: Glycoprotein E2, the immunodominant protein of classical swine fever virus (CSFV), can induce
neutralizing antibodies and confer protective immunity in pigs. Our previous phylogenetic analysis showed that
subgroup 2.1 viruses branched away from subgroup 1.1, the vaccine C-strain lineage, and became dominant in
China. The E2 glycoproteins of CSFV C-strain and recent subgroup 2.1 field isolates are genetically different.
However, it has not been clearly demonstrated how this diversity affects antigenicity of the protein.
Results: Antigenic variation of glycoprotein E2 was observed not only between CSFV vaccine C-strain and
subgroup 2.1 strains, but also among strains of the same subgroup 2.1 as determined by ELISA-based binding
assay using pig antisera to the C-strain and a representative subgroup 2.1 strain QZ-07 currently circulating in
China. Antigenic incompatibility of E2 proteins markedly reduced neutralization efficiency against heterologous
strains. Single amino acid substitutions of D705N, L709P, G713E, N723S, and S779A on C-strain recombinant E2 (rE2)
proteins significantly increased heterologous binding to anti-QZ-07 serum, suggesting that these residues may be
responsible for the antigenic variation between the C-strain and subgroup 2.1 strains. Notably, a G713E substitution
caused the most dramatic enhancement of binding of the variant C-strain rE2 protein to anti-QZ-07 serum.
Multiple sequence alignment revealed that the glutamic acid residue at this position is conserved within group 2
strains, while the glycine residue is invariant among the vaccine strains, highlighting the role of the residue at this
position as a major determinant of antigenic variation of E2. A variant Simpson’s index analysis showed that both
codons and amino acids of the residues contributing to antigenic variation have undergone similar diversification.
Conclusions: These results demonstrate that CSFV vaccine C-strain and group 2 strains circulating in China differ in
the antigenicity of their E2 glycoproteins. Systematic site-directed mutagenesis of the antigenic units has revealed
residues that limit cross-reactivity. Our findings may be useful for the development of serological differential assays
and improvement of immunogenicity of novel classical swine fever vaccines.

Background
Classical swine fever virus (CSFV) is a small, enveloped,
positive-stranded RNA virus that causes classical swine
fever (CSF), a highly contagious disease of swine and
wild boars [1]. CSFV belongs to the genus Pestivirus of

the family Flaviviridae. The genus also includes bovine
viral diarrhea virus and border disease virus which are
important livestock pathogens [2,3]. CSF viruses can be
divided into three major groups with ten subgroups by
genetic typing [4]. Recent phylogenetic analyses indicated that there has been a switch in the virus population from the historical group 1 or 3 to the recent
group 2 in many European and Asian countries [4-9].

different countries belong to group 1 [4], including the
subgroup 1.1 Chinese lapinized vaccine strain (C-strain)
which was derived by serial passage of a virulent strain
in rabbits. The C-strain has been used for prophylactic
vaccination in China since 1954. Two independent studies also reported that subgroup 2.1 strains recently
branched away from the vaccine C-strain and became
dominant in China [10,11].
E2 is the major envelope glycoprotein exposed on the
surface of the virion. It is essential for virus attachment
and entry into the host cells as well as cell tropism
[12,13]. This glycoprotein has been implicated as one of
the virulence determinants [14,15]. In addition, it can
induce neutralizing antibodies and confer protective
immunity in pigs [16-21]. The antigenic structure of E2
has been identified using a number of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Two independent antigenic units, B/C
and A/D (residues 690-800 and 766-865, respectively)
have been identified in the N-terminal half of E2
[22,23]. In this context, deletion of the C-terminal half
did not affect antibody binding [22-24], and the first six
conserved cysteine residues as well as the antigenic
motif 771LLFD774 are important for the antigenic structure of E2 [22,25].
Genetic diversity of E2 among different groups has
been extensively studied [4,10,26-29]. The N-terminal
half of E2 is more variable than the C-terminal half [10],
suggesting that the antigenic units could be under positive selection apparently due to constant exposure to
high immunologic pressure. Different patterns of reactivity with mAbs provided clues of antigenic variation of
E2 among different CSFV isolates [11,25,30-33]. A study
using neutralizing mAbs to select mAb-resistant
mutants showed that, in most cases, single point mutations could lead to complete loss of mAbs binding [22].
Furthermore, amino acid (aa) substitutions at position
710 on the E2 proteins of different strains affected binding and neutralization by a panel of mAbs [34]. Single
amino acid exchanges between a group 1 vaccine strain
LPC and a group 3 field isolate could totally reverse the
mAbs binding pattern [35]. Taken together, variability
by one or more amino acids within antigenic units may
result in the antigenic variation of E2. To our knowledge, all studies that attempted to resolve antigenic variation of glycoprotein E2 utilized mouse mAbs
[11,25,30-35]. No attempt has been made to probe the
antigenic variation or group-specific antigenic determinants using anti-CSFV sera from pig, the natural host of
CSFV. In addition, little is known about how glycoprotein E2 variation among different CSFV groups and subgroups influences cross-neutralization.
In this study, we raised pig antisera against CSFV vaccine C-strain and a representative subgroup 2.1 strain
QZ-07 to assess the extent of antigenic variation within

antigenic units of glycoprotein E2. Rabbit polyclonal and
mouse monoclonal antibodies were raised against
recombinant E2 (rE2) protein from C-strain to evaluate
if antigenic variation of E2 results in differences in
cross-neutralization. A series of variant C-strain rE2
proteins with single substitutions based on amino acid
differences between the C-strain and group 2 isolates
were used to define residues involved in antigenic variation of E2.

Results
Evaluation of antigenic reactivity of the rE2 proteins
expressed in E. coli

The use of prokaryotic-derived truncated rE2 proteins
has been applied in antigen production, antigenic
domain identification and epitope mapping [24,36-40].
In this study, two types of truncated rE2 proteins were
expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells (Figure 1A and
Table 1). One protein, rE2-BC (aa 690-814), covered the
N-terminal 123 residues which are considered to constitute the minimal antigenic domain required for binding
to pig anti-CSFV serum [24]. The other protein, rE2-AD
(aa 690-865), contained both antigenic units B/C and A/
D [22,23]. Western blotting indicated that rE2-BC and
rE2-AD proteins of the vaccine C-strain had the molecular weights of 20 and 25 kDa, respectively, and
reacted strongly with pig anti-C-strain hyperimmune
serum (Figure 1B). Therefore, the prokaryotic-derived
rE2 proteins were suitable for use as immunogens to
generate polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies as well
as for the antibody binding assessments.
Reactivity of pig anti-CSFV sera with different rE2-AD
proteins

To assess the antigenic variation of E2 between the subgroup 1.1 C-strain and subgroup 2.1 field isolates, the
respective rE2-AD proteins were cross-examined by
ELISA with antisera collected from pigs at different time
points after immunization with the vaccine C-strain or
infection with strain QZ-07 (representing subgroup 2.1).
Figure 2 shows that each antiserum reacted much more
strongly with rE2-AD protein of the homologous strain
(used to prepare the serum) than that of the heterologous strain. Figure 3 further compares binding efficiency
of anti-C-strain and anti-QZ-07 sera (collected at 78
days post immunization with the C-strain and 25 days
post infection with strain QZ-07, respectively) to rE2AD proteins derived from C-strain and 8 subgroup 2.1
strains. The homologous binding efficiency was set at
100%. The anti-C-strain serum exhibited significantly
low efficiency of binding to subgroup 2.1 rE2-AD proteins (below 60% efficiency). Binding of anti-Q7-07
serum to the C-strain rE2-AD protein was even more
inefficient (below 20% efficiency), and the band was

barely visible on the blot. Binding of anti-QZ-07 serum
to heterologous subgroup 2.1 proteins was varied. While
binding with the majority of these proteins was strong
(above 80% efficiency), the efficiency of binding with
rE2-AD proteins of HZ1-08 and QZ2-06 was below 60%
efficiency resulting in faint bands on the blot.

Neutralization of different viruses by anti-CSFV sera or
E2-specific antibodies

A two-way neutralization analysis using the pig antiCSFV sera revealed that heterologous neutralization was
less effective, especially with sera collected at the early
days following vaccination or infection (Figure 4).

Interestingly, neutralization efficiency also differed
between subgroup 2.1 strains QZ-07 and HZ1-08. Since
strain variation influences the ability of antisera to neutralize heterologous viruses, and inefficient binding of
antisera to heterologous rE2-AD proteins was also
observed (Figure 3), we sought to determine whether
variation of glycoprotein E2 affects CSFV cross-neutralization. Thus, we raised a rabbit antiserum (polyclonal
antibodies) and three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)
against C-strain rE2-AD protein. The rabbit antiserum
neutralized the QZ-07 virus less efficiently (log10 1.8)
than the C-strain (log10 2.1). Furthermore, substitution
of cysteine residues in the antigenic unit B/C with serine
residues abolished the reactivity of mAbs 1E7 and 6B8
to E2. However, such mutagenesis did not affect the
reactivity of mAb 2B6 (Table 2). These results indicate
that these cysteine residues are involved in the

structural conformation of E2 [22,23] and that mAbs
1E7 and 6B8 bind to conformational epitopes. In addition, mAb 2B6 only bound to C-strain although its neutralization efficiency was low. The conformational mAbs
1E7 and 6B8 bound to both the C-strain and heterologous subgroup 2.1 viruses but they were less efficient at
binding to and neutralizing subgroup 2.1 strains (Table
2). Collectively, these data indicate that strain and glycoprotein E2 variation affect CSFV cross-neutralization.
Identification of amino acid residues associated with
antigenic variation of E2

To determine the amino acid residues responsible for
the observed antigenic variation, E2 sequences of 108
CSFV strains representative of each group were obtained
from GenBank and aligned. Twenty major variable residues were identified within the antigenic units. Table 3

Figure 4 Neutralization of different CSFV strains by pig anti-CSFV sera. Virus-specific neutralizing antibodies were cross-examined by
neutralization assay with antisera collected from pigs as indicated in Figure 2 legend. Two-fold serial dilutions of the different heat-inactivated
sera were mixed with equal volumes of 100 TCID50 of the viruses, incubated at 37°C for 1 h and subsequently transferred to confluent
monolayers of ST cells in 96-well plates. The starting dilution of each serum was 1:50. At 72 hours post-infection, the cells were fixed and stained
for the presence of E2 glycoprotein by immunofluorescence assay. Neutralization index (NI) is the log10 of the antibody dilution factor (reciprocal
of dilution) when 50% of the wells are protected from infection. Since the starting dilution factor was 50, the NI value of 1.7 is the detection
threshold of our neutralization assay. Neutralization indices below 1.7 are indicated as “†”.

shows the variability of these residues between vaccine
strains and representative group 2 strains.
We used site-directed mutagenesis to systematically
substitute amino acids in C-strain E2 protein with those
found at the same positions in subgroup 2.1 proteins
(Table 3 - 2nd last row). The binding of the wild type
and variant C-strain rE2 proteins to C-strain and strain
QZ-07 antisera was determined by binding ELISA.
Wells of plates were coated with equal quantities of proteins and the antibodies were above saturation levels to
ensure that antibody concentration was not limiting.
The binding of the wt C-strain rE2 protein to either of
the sera was set at 100%. None of the substitutions
changed the binding of the variant rE2 proteins to antiC-strain serum significantly (binding efficiency was
between 80%-130%), suggesting that these residues did
not contribute individually to the overall capacity of Cstrain rE2 protein to bind the antibodies (Figure 5A).
However, thirteen substitutions increased binding of the

variant C-strain rE2 proteins to anti-QZ-07 serum (i.e.,
above 150% binding efficiency threshold). Substitution
of D705N, L709P, G713E, N723S, or S779A caused a
significant increase in binding efficiency (i.e., above
200% threshold), while a moderate increase was
observed with D725G, N729D, N777S, T780I, D847E,
M854V, T860I, or N863K substitution (between 150%
and 200% efficiency). Remarkably, the G713E substitution dramatically enhanced binding of the variant rE2
protein to anti-QZ-07 serum as indicated by the more
than 5-fold increase in binding efficiency (Figure 5A)
and a strong reaction observed in the Western blot (Figure 5B). This residue is conserved within group 2 strains
but different from the vaccine strains (Table 3), implying
its role as a major determinant of antigenic variation.
The residues that caused significant or moderate
increase of binding efficiency formed three distinct clusters in the antigenic units (Figure 1A). The first cluster
is located in the N-terminus of antigenic unit B/C at the

Figure 5 Identification of residues and regions involved in antigenic variation of glycoprotein E2. (A) Binding of the wild type (wt) and
variant C-strain rE2 proteins to pig anti-C-strain or anti-QZ-07 sera. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to systematically substitute amino acids
in C-strain E2 protein with those found at the same positions in subgroup 2.1 proteins. The substituted amino acids are depicted on the x axis.
The y axis shows relative binding efficiency of individual rE2 proteins. For each of the variant C-strain rE2 proteins, the binding efficiency was
determined by normalizing to anti-his-tag binding first, and then to the wt C-strain rE2 protein binding to pig anti-C-strain and anti-QZ-07 sera,
respectively. Thus, the binding of the wt C-strain rE2 protein to either of the sera was set at 100%. rE2-BC proteins were used for A692S, D705N,
E706K, L709P, G713E, N723S, D725G, N729D, S736I, V738T, T745I, N777S, S779A, T780I, R788G, and S789F substitutions because these residues are
located in the antigenic unit B/C. rE2-AD proteins were used for D847E, M854V, T860I, and N863K substitutions since these residues are located
in the antigenic unit A/D. The binding efficiency is relative to C-strain rE2-BC or rE2-AD binding to the reference serum depending on the kind
of variant protein being compared. (B) Western blots of G713E variant rE2-BC protein using pig anti-QZ-07 serum and mouse monoclonal antiHis-tag antibody. The wt rE2-BC of C-strain and rE2-AD of strain QZ-07 are set as controls. (C) Hydrophilicity profile comparison of the antigenic
units of E2 between the C-strain and strain QZ-07. The vertical axis represents the hydrophilicity scores.

amino acid positions 702-731. The second cluster is at
the boundary between the two antigenic units at positions 774-799 and the third one is in the C-terminus of
antigenic unit A/D at positions 841-864. Interestingly,
hydrophilicity analysis further demonstrated that these
regions contribute to major hydrophilic differences
between CSFV C-strain and strain QZ-07 (Figure 5C).
Analysis of codon and amino acid diversity in the
antigenic units of E2

To get more insight into antigenic and genetic evolution
of the antigenic units, the diversity of codon and amino
acid was analyzed by a variant Simpson’s index [41]. Figure 6 shows that the thirteen residues associated with
antigenic variation (Figure 5 and Table 3) lie along the
diagonal (x = y), indicating that these residues are highly
diversified due to accumulation of large numbers of
nonsynonymous mutations in their codons. In contrast,
the six cysteine residues and residues in the 771LLFD774
motif [25] lie along the x axis due to high conservation
even though their codons have accumulated a moderate
number of synonymous mutations. However, the antigenic residues identified by mAb-resistant mutants

analysis [22] were mapped as having random distribution (Figure 6).

Discussion
Phylogenetically, CSFV consists of three major groups
[4]. Recent studies revealed that viral populations have
shifted from the historical group 1 or 3 to group 2 in
most European and Asian countries [4-10]. Glycoprotein
E2 is a principal target of neutralizing antibodies and an
important protective immunogen [16-21]. The E2 glycoproteins of three groups are genetically and antigenically
different [4,10,11,25-35]. However, the basis of this antigenic variation has not been clearly demonstrated at the
molecular level.
Our data show that both pig anti-C-strain and anti-QZ07 sera bound heterologous rE2-AD proteins (from CSFV
strain QZ-07 and C-strain, respectively) with <60% efficiency compared to homologous proteins (Figure 3A),
indicating that these proteins are antigenically different.
Further, the E2 protein of vaccine C-strain is antigenically
distinct from those of a wide spectrum of subgroup 2.1
strains. Antigenic variation was also detected among subgroup 2.1 strains as indicated by the inefficiency of pig

Figure 6 Analysis of codon and amino acid diversity of residues within the antigenic units of glycoprotein E2. Codon and amino acid
diversity was quantified using a modified Simpson’s index [41]. Antigenic residues identified in this study are colored according to the antigenic
regions (AR) where they occur. Residues of the antigenic motif of 771LLFD774 [25], the six conserved cysteine residues and the antigenic residues
identified by mAb-resistant (MAR) mutants analysis [22], are marked in yellow, green and grey, respectively. The other residues are shown in
black.

anti-QZ-07 serum to bind HZ1-08- and QZ2-06-derived
rE2-AD proteins (Figure 3). Our data further demonstrate
that the previously reported differences in antigenicity
detected by mouse mAbs [11,25,30-35] also occur in the
context of pig anti-CSFV sera.
We performed neutralization experiments to assess
whether the differences in the efficiency of antibody
binding to rE2 proteins (Figure 3) correlate with the
ability of the antibody to block CSFV infection. A
two-way neutralization determination showed that pig
anti-CSFV sera neutralized heterologous strains less efficiently (Figure 4). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against
purified C-strain rE2-AD protein also showed less efficiency at neutralizing strain QZ-07. Furthermore, two
conformational anti-C-strain-rE2-AD mAbs (1E7 and
6B8) had lower binding and neutralization efficiency
against the heterologous strains compared to C-strain
(Table 2), suggesting that the neutralization differences
seen with pig anti-CSFV sera were, at least in part, due
to differential expression of antigenic epitopes on the E2
glycoproteins of CSFV strains. Such antigenic variation
may explain why subgroup 2.1 CSFV strains persist in
China despite the wide use of vaccine C-strain. Antibody selection may be one of the reasons for the switch
of viral populations from group 1 to 2.
We used site-directed mutagenesis to introduce amino
acid substitutions in the C-strain rE2 proteins in order
to probe whether variable residues (Table 3) contribute
to the antigenic variation seen with subgroup 2.1 strains.
Unlike the mutations in the antigenic motif 771LLFD774
that disrupted the structural integrity of E2 protein [25],
none of the substitutions had a significant effect on
binding to anti-C-strain serum (Figure 5A). We infer
that the recombinant proteins were not grossly misfolded and the substituted residues may not be critical
for the overall structural stability of glycoprotein E2. In
contrast, of the 20 substitutions, 13 enhanced binding of
the variant C-strain rE2 proteins to anti-QZ-07 serum
(Figure 5A). The most dramatic increase in binding was
caused by the G®E substitution at aa position 713
(Figure 5A and 5B). Sequence alignment revealed that
all group 2 strains have residue 713E, while all the vaccine strains have 713G (Table 3). Chang et al. recently
reported that residues 713 E and 729 D were critical for
specificity of a group 3.4 field strain rE2 protein to
mAbs [35]. It appears that 713E is a common antigenic
determinant for both groups 2 and 3. Our work demonstrates that although residue 729D enhanced binding to
pig anti-QZ-07 serum, residues 705 N, 709 P, 723 S, and
779
A had much more significant contribution (Figure
5A). Notably, the same residues are found at positions
705 and 723 on E2 proteins of subgroup 2.1 and subgroup 3.4 strains. It is possible that these two residues
may also show superior contribution to the antigenicity

Page 10 of 14

of subgroup 3.4 glycoprotein E2 if probed with pig antisera against group 3 strains. In this study, we used polyclonal sera from pigs C-strain-immunized or infected
with a field strain which contained the full spectrum of
immunization- or infection-induced antibodies. This is
why these polyclonal sera could identify more residues
responsible for antigenic variation of glycoprotein E2
than mouse mAbs [35]. Furthermore, pairing of the
polyclonal antisera against the group 1 C-strain and
representative group 2 field strain could probe the residues that mediate antigenic variation between the two
groups, another advantage over mAbs.
Based on the data revealed by the site-directed mutagenesis analysis (Figure 5A), the antigenic variation
among subgroup 2.1 strains is not unexpected since
each of the 8 subgroup 2.1 strains used in this study has
some unique strain-specific substitutions (data not
shown). The C737R substitution in the antigenic units
of strain QZ2-06 appears to affect binding the most.
This can be explained by the fact that the cysteine residue at this position is critical for the antigenic structure
of the protein [22]. We speculate that E782V substitution in strain HZ1-08 is the key determinant of
antigenic variation between strain HZ1-08 and our
reference subgroup 2.1 strain QZ-07.
Three discrete antigenic regions were mapped at aa
positions 702-731, 774-799 and 841-864, in the antigenic units of E2 protein (Figure 1A). Several antigenic
residues identified by mAb-resistant mutants analysis
[22] or epitope mapping [35] and substitutions with significant increase in binding of variant rE2 proteins to
anti-QZ-07 serum examined in this study are clustered
in the 702-731 region (Figure 5A), implying that evolution of this region is the primary cause of antigenic variation of glycoprotein E2. The N-terminus of antigenic
region 774-799 contains the conserved antigenic motif
771
LLFD774 [25] and a conserved linear 772LFDGTNP778
epitope [39], suggesting its essential role in maintaining
the integrity of antigenic structure of E2 protein. In
addition, the substitutions of N777S, S779A, and T780I
in this region enhanced binding of variant rE2 proteins
to anti-QZ-07 serum (Figure 5A). Therefore, region
774-799 may have multiple functions in shaping the
antigenicity of E2.
Finally, we analyzed E2 sequences of CSFV in order to
compare codon and amino acid diversification in relation to antigenic evolution. We employed a variant
Simpson’s index that has been used to quantify codon
and amino acid diversity in the antigenic epitopes of
influenza virus hemagglutinin glycoprotein [41,42]. The
diversity of each of the thirteen amino acid residues
involved in antigenic variation is equivalent to that of
the corresponding codon (Figure 6: the unique distribution along the x = y diagonal), indicating a remarkable

Chen et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:378
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/378

correlation between genetic and antigenic evolution
within the antigenic units of glycoprotein E2 in nature.
In contrast, the antigenic residues identified by mAbresistant mutants analysis [22] are randomly diversified
(Figure 6: randomly distributed grey-colored residues),
suggesting that in vitro selection may not explain natural selection in pig. Co-diversification of codons and
amino acids involved in antigenic variation in the field
strains could be one of the immune evasion mechanisms
that CSFV employs under immune pressure as a result
of extensive vaccination [43].

Conclusions
This study demonstrates antigenic variation of CSFV
glycoprotein E2 between the vaccine C-strain and group
2 field strains or even within group 2 strains currently
circulating in China. Of the three discrete regions associated with antigenic variation, substitutions in the first
region (aa 702-731) are the primary determinants of the
antigenic variation of E2. Since glycoprotein E2 variation
affects CSFV cross-neutralization, subsequent work will
determine whether these antigenic residues contribute
to the observed neutralization differences. Our findings
may provide useful information for the development of
differential serological assays and novel CSF vaccines
with improved immunogenicity and efficacy.
Materials and Methods
Cells and viruses

Swine testicle (ST) cells were grown in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM, Gibco, USA) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The following CSFV
strains were used: the subgroup 1.1 vaccine C-strain
widely used for prophylactic vaccination in China and
two subgroup 2.1 strains recently circulating in China
(strains QZ-07 and HZ1-08). CSFV vaccine C-strain was
obtained from Zhejiang Jianliang Biological Engineering
Company (Zhejiang province, China). Two subgroup 2.1
strains were originally isolated from spleens of naturally
infected pigs and replicated in ST cells in our laboratory. These three viruses were propagated and titrated
in ST cells. Stocks were aliquoted and stored at -80°C
until use. The virus stocks were sequenced to confirm
that the E2 genes had the expected sequences. The
other 6 subgroup 2.1 strains were not isolated and only
their E2 genes were directly cloned in plasmids.
Sequence data is available in GenBank as listed in Table
3. Details of their molecular phylogenetic relationships
have been described elsewhere [10,26].
E2 sequence dataset

All E2 sequences covering the complete antigenic region
were retrieved from NCBI database. The nucleotide and
amino acid sequences were aligned using Clustal X

Page 11 of 14

software (version 1.83). Sequences with 100% nucleotide
identity were excluded. The remaining sequences
included 23, 82 and 3 sequences representing groups 1,
2 and 3, respectively. This dataset was used to identify
the major variable residues (see Table 3) and to analyze
the codon and amino acid diversity (Figure 6).
Construction of expression plasmids

The plasmids containing full-length E2 gene of the vaccine C-strain and eight subgroup 2.1 strains used in this
study were previously described [10,26]. The C-strain
specific primer sets C-E2-AD-f/C-E2-AD-r and C-E2BC-f/C-E2-BC-r were used to amplify the fragment covering the two antigenic units (B/C+A/D) and the fragment only containing antigenic unit B/C, respectively.
Primer set QZ-E2-AD-f/QZ-E2-AD-r was used to
amplify the fragments covering the two antigenic units
of group 2 isolates (Table 1). PCR amplicons were
digested with restriction enzymes BamHI and XhoI, gel
purified and ligated into prokaryotic expression vector
pET-30a(+). To construct the eukaryotic expression
plasmid, a 1212-bp cDNA fragment encoding the signal
sequence and full-length E2 of C-strain was amplified
with primer set C-E2-f and C-E2-r (Table 1), and cloned
into pcDNA3.1 following BamHI and XhoI digestion.
Expression and purification of the prokaryotic-derived,
His-tagged rE2 proteins

E. coli Rosetta (DE3) cells containing different recombinant plasmids were cultured to an optical density (OD)
between 0.6 and 0.8 at 600 nm. Expression of
His-tagged rE2 proteins was induced with 1 mM isopropyl-b-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG, Sigma-Aldrich). Cells
were harvested and disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation, the inclusion bodies with rE2 proteins were
resuspended with 1/10 volume of buffer (100 mM
NaH2PO4·2H2O, 10 mM Tris-base, and 8 M Urea). The
supernatant was collected after centrifugation and purified by Ni-NTA affinity column (Novagen, Madison,
WI) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Finally,
the proteins were refolded by washing the column with
40 ml of Tris-buffered saline (TBS, pH 7.4) containing
1 M urea and eluted from the column with 200 mM
imidazole in TBS. The purified rE2 proteins were confirmed by Western blotting with mouse monoclonal
anti-His-tag antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) and quantified by
the Bradford assay.
Production of antibodies against CSFV C-strain and
strain QZ-07

The pig hyperimmune serum against CSFV vaccine Cstrain was previously prepared and stocked in our
laboratory. The pig antiserum to the C-strain (pig antiC-strain) or to the strain QZ-07 (pig anti-QZ-07) was

Chen et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:378
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/378

induced by intramuscular immunization of 30-day-old
CSFV-free pigs with the attenuated vaccine C-strain by
prime-boost strategy or infection with 10 5 TCID50 of
strain QZ-07 in a biosafety level III facility, respectively.
The sera were collected at different times post-vaccination or infection and stored at -80°C until use. The sera
at highest titers collected at 78 days post immunization
with the C-strain and 25 days post infection with strain
QZ-07 (see Figure 2) were used for binding ELISAs in
Figure 3A and Figure 5A and Western blots in Figure
3B and Figure 5B.
The rabbit antiserum to the rE2-AD protein of
C-strain was generated as follows: New Zealand white
rabbits were immunized and boosted two times with
0.5 mg of the purified rE2-AD protein of C-strain
(expressed in E. coli) emulsified with an equal volume of
complete/incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (Sigma-Aldrich).
Blood was drawn for antiserum preparation once maximum level of antibody production was reached.
For monoclonal antibodies against the rE2-AD protein
of C-strain, four 5-week-old female specific-pathogenfree BALB/c mice were immunized subcutaneously with
0.1 mg of the purified rE2-AD protein of vaccine
C-strain emulsified in complete Freund’s adjuvant. The
mice were intraperitoneally boosted twice with rE2-AD
protein emulsified in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant at
2-week intervals. The mice were euthanized 2 weeks
after the last boosting and spleen cells were harvested.
Splenocytes were fused with SP2/0 myeloma cells using
50% (v/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG, Sigma-Aldrich). The
resulting hybridomas secreting antibodies against rE2AD protein were selected by immunofluorescence assay
(IFA), and then clonally expanded. Antibody subtyping
was performed using mouse mAb Isotyping Reagents
(Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Ascites were produced in pristine-primed
BALB/c mice. Experiments with animals were approved
by the Laboratory Animal Management Committee (animal welfare ethics is part of its duties) of Zhejiang
University.
Site-directed mutagenesis of the C-strain based E2
proteins

To identify the antigenic units recognized by mAbs,
cysteine codons of the C-strain E2 gene in eukaryotic
expression plasmid were mutated to serine codons by
site-directed mutagenesis as described previously [22].
Multiple E2 sequence alignment was used to identify
variable residues. Twenty major variable residues were
identified in the antigenic units (Table 3). These do not
include K®R or S®T substitutions (K720R, K734R,
K761R, S797T, and R845K substitutions). To substitute
C-strain residues for those found in group 2 isolates,
plasmids encoding individual mutations (listed in

Page 12 of 14

Table 3) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis.
Substitutions were made on plasmids encoding the antigenic unit B/C or two units (B/C+A/D) of C-strain E2
protein depending on where the residue being substituted is located in the antigenic units.
All substitutions were performed using QuikChange
Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The primers were designed via the QuikChange Primer Design
Program http://www.stratagene.com. The desired
nucleotide changes in each mutant were verified by
sequencing. Expression and purification of variant rE2
proteins was done as mentioned above.
Binding ELISA with recombinant E2 proteins

All ELISAs described in this study were performed in
triplicate under stringent conditions to avoid nonspecific
reactions. Antibodies were diluted using phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) containing 5% nonfat dry
milk (PBS/NFDM); each washing step included 5 washes
with PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (PBS/Tween).
Briefly, a 100-μl volume of different rE2 proteins (10 μg/
ml in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6) was
added into each well of 96-well microtiter plates (MaxiSorp, Nunc, Denmark) for overnight incubation at 4°C.
The wells were washed with PBS/Tween and then
blocked with PBS/NFDM at 37°C for 2 h. The wells
were washed and incubated with different antibodies for
1 h. The wells were washed again and then incubated
with horseradish peroxidase conjugated SPA at 37°C for
1 h. Thereafter, wells were washed and incubated with
100 μl/well of the chromogenic substrate 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB, Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for
4 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 2
M H 2 SO 4 . Finally, the OD 450 nm was measured using
spectraMax @M2 microplate reader (Molecular devices
Corp., USA).
The binding efficiency of rE2-AD proteins from Cstrain and 8 subgroup 2.1 strains with the two pig antisera to the C-strain and strain QZ-07 (Figure 3A) was
normalized to anti-His-tag binding first, and then
expressed as the ratio of antibody bound to individual
group 2 rE2-AD protein to that bound to the rE2-AD
proteins of C-strain or strain QZ-07, which was set at
100%. The mean binding efficiency of each individual
protein was calculated for three independent ELISA
assays.
For variant C-strain rE2 proteins in Figure 5A, rE2-BC
proteins were used for A692S, D705N, E706K, L709P,
G713E, N723S, D725G, N729D, S736I, V738T, T745I,
N777S, S779A, T780I, R788G, and S789F substitutions
because these residues are located in the antigenic unit
B/C. rE2-AD proteins were used for D847E, M854V,
T860I, and N863K substitutions since these residues are

Chen et al. Virology Journal 2010, 7:378
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/378

located in the antigenic unit A/D. The results were first
normalized to anti-His-tag binding and then expressed
as the ratio of their binding to the antibodies to that of
binding to C-strain wild type rE2-BC or rE2-AD binding
to the reference serum depending on the kind of variant
protein being compared. Relative binding of greater than
200% efficiency were designated as significant increases
in antibody binding. Binding efficiencies between 150%
and 200% efficiency were considered as moderate
increases whereas those between 50% and 150% efficiency were considered as limited effect on antibody
binding.
Western blot analysis

The antigenic reactivity of different rE2 proteins was
assessed by Western blotting. The proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (PALL Corp., USA). The membranes
were subsequently blocked (overnight at 4°C) in blocking buffer (PBS/NFDM) and then incubated at 37°C for
1 h with different antibodies. After incubation, membranes were rinsed for 20 min in PBS/Tween, and
bound antibodies were detected with SPA-conjugated
with horseradish peroxidase diluted at 1:2500. For color
development, 4-chloro-1-naphthol (4-CN, SigmaAldrich) was used.
Virus neutralization assay

The neutralization indices (NI) of the antibodies against
different CSFV strains were determined by virus neutralization assay. Briefly, ST cells were seeded in 96-well
tissue culture plates and incubated overnight at 37°C.
Two-fold serial dilutions of the different heat-inactivated
sera were mixed with equal volumes of 100 TCID 50
virus suspensions, incubated at 37°C for 1 h and subsequently transferred to confluent monolayers of ST cells
in 96-well plates. The starting dilution of each serum
was 1:50. At 72 hours post-infection, the cells were
fixed and stained for the presence of glycoprotein E2 by
immunofluorescence assay. The NI is the log10 of the
antibody dilution factor (reciprocal of dilution) when
50% of the wells are protected from infection. Since the
starting dilution factor was 50, the NI value of 1.7 is the
detection threshold of our neutralization assay.
Immunofluorescence assay

Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was used to verify the
reactivity of the CSFV strains or cysteine-mutated E2
proteins with different antibodies. Briefly, cells infected
with CSFV strains at 72 h or cells transfected with
cysteine-mutated recombinant plasmids at 48 h were
fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for
60 min and permeabilized for 10 min with 0.1% Triton
X-100 in PBS. The cells were incubated for 1 h with

different antibodies, and then stained with goat anti-rabbit antibody conjugated with Texas green or goat antimouse antibody conjugated with Alexa red (Molecular
Probes Inc., USA) for another 1 h. Cells were examined
under the IX71 inverted fluorescence microscope
(Olympus, Japan).
Hydrophobicity profile and evolution analysis within
antigenic units of E2

Hydrophobicity profile was generated using DNASIS
software by the method of Kyte and Doolittle [44]. Evolution analysis was performed using an information-theoretic method described by Plotkin and Dushoff [41].
Briefly, we plotted the diversity of codons found at each
residue against the diversity of amino acids found at the
same residue. The diversity of codons or amino acids
was quantified by a variant Simpson’s index: D = 1-pi2,
where p i denotes the relative frequency of the i-th
codon or amino acid at the residue in the multiple
sequence alignment.
