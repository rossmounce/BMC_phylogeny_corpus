Conservation and Loss of Ribosomal RNA Gene
Sites in Diploid and Polyploid Fragaria (Rosaceae)
Bo Liu and Thomas M Davis*

Abstract
Background: The genus Fragaria comprises species at ploidy levels ranging from diploid (2n = 2x = 14) to
decaploid (2n = 10x = 70). Fluorescence in situ hybridization with 5S and 25S rDNA probes was performed to
gather cytogenetic information that illuminates genomic divergence among different taxa at multiple ploidy levels,
as well as to explore the evolution of ribosomal RNA genes during polyploidization in Fragaria.
Results: Root tip cells of diploid taxa were typified by two 5S and six 25S rDNA hybridization signals of varying
intensities, providing a baseline for comparisons within the genus. In three exceptional diploid genotypes, F.
nilgerrensis (CFRA 1358 and CFRA 1825) and F. vesca ’Yellow Wonder’, two 5S but only four 25S rDNA sites were
found but with differing site losses. The numbers of 5S and 25S rDNA signals, respectively were three and nine in a
triploid F. ×bifera accession, and were four and twelve in three tetraploids, thus occurring in proportional 1.5× and
2× multiples of the typical diploid pattern. In hexaploid F. moschata, a proportional multiple of six 5S rDNA sites
was observed, but the number of 25S rDNA sites was one or two less than the proportionate prediction of
eighteen. This apparent tendency toward rDNA site loss at higher ploidy was markedly expanded in octoploids,
which displayed only two 5S and ten 25S rDNA sites. In the two decaploids examined, the numbers of 5S and 25S
rDNA signals, respectively, were four and fifteen in F. virginiana subsp. platypetala, and six and twelve in F.
iturupensis.
Conclusions: Among diploid Fragaria species, a general consistency of rDNA site numbers implies conserved
genomic organization, but highly variable 25S signal sizes and intensities and two instances of site loss suggest
concurrent high dynamics of rDNA copy numbers among both homologs and non-homologs. General
conservation of rDNA site numbers in lower ploidy, but marked site number reductions at higher ploidy levels,
suggest complex evolution of rDNA sites during polyploidization and/or independent evolutionary pathways for 6x
versus higher ploidy strawberries. Site number comparisons suggest common genomic composition among natural
octoploids, and independent origins of the two divergent decaploid accessions.

Background
The strawberry genus Fragaria belongs to the Rosaceae,
an economically important plant family, and includes
about 24 species distributed mostly throughout the temperate zone of Europe, Asia, North and South America
[1,2]. Historically, a basic chromosome number of seven
(x = 7) and the existence of multiple levels of ploidy,
ranging from diploid to octoploid, in this genus had
been documented by 1926 [3,4]. Only recently, a naturally occurring decaploid cytotype (2n = 10x = 70) was
revealed through chromosome counting and flow

cytometry [5] in the geographically isolated species F.
iturupensis, which had initially been described as an
octoploid (2n = 8x = 56) [6]. In addition, an accession
(CFRA 110) of F. virginiana subsp. platypetala has been
found by chromosome counting to be decaploid [7].
Currently, twelve diploid (2n = 2x = 14), five tetraploid
(2n = 4x = 28), a single hexaploid (2n = 6x = 42) F.
moschata , three octoploid (2n = 8x = 56) species,
including the main cultivated species F. ×ananassa and
its immediate octoploid ancestors: F. chiloensis and F.
virginiana [8], and a decaploid (2n = 10x = 70) F. iturupensis are recognized [1,5,9,10]. In addition, variableand odd-ploidy have been recognized in two hybrid
taxa: pentaploid/hexaploid/enneaploid (2n = 5x/6x/9x =

35/42/63) F. ×bringhurstii [11] and diploid/triploid (2n =
2x/3x = 14/21) F. ×bifera [12]. The higher level (> 4x)
polyploids are all considered to have at least partially
allopolyploid genome compositions; however, classifications of origins as auto- or allo-ploidy have not been
resolved at the tetraploid level [13].
Non-isotopic in situ hybridization (ISH) was introduced in plants in 1985 [14], and fluorescence-based
techniques (FISH) have subsequently become routine
methods for physical mapping of repetitive DNA
sequences and multicopy gene families [15] and other
DNA sequences onto chromosomes [16], as well as
for the identification of individual chromosomes (e.g.,
[17]). Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes have been the
most widely targeted probe sites due to their high
copy numbers, specific chromosomal positions and
the high degree of sequence conservation among different plant groups [18,19]. In eukaryotes, including
higher plants, nuclear 18S, 5.8S and 25/28S rRNAs
(25S in plants; 28S in mammals) [20,21] result from
processing of a 45S transcript encoded by rDNA
repeated units clustered at particular chromosomal
sites. The 5S rRNA results from transcription of distinct gene clusters located in different chromosomal
sites [22].
Previous reports on cytogenetics in strawberry are
mostly limited to chromosome counting, as initiated by
Ichijima [3] and Longley [4], and more recently to traditional karyotype analysis [7,23-26]. In the field of modern molecular cytogenetics, in which fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) techniques play a key role, work on
strawberry has been minimal. Feasibility of FISH with
rDNA probes was first established by Lim [27] in
diploid strawberry, with confirmation by Shulaev et al.
[28], but the technique has yet to be extended to the
genetically and cytologically more complex genomes of
the polyploid Fragaria species. As a genus that spans
ploidy levels from diploid through decaploid, the genus
Fragaria offers a previously untapped opportunity for
studying the evolutionary changes in chromosomal
rDNA arrays that have occurred during polyploidy evolution, and will contribute to ongoing efforts to define
the genomic composition(s) of the polyploid strawberry
species. Moreover, we anticipate that the study reported
here will contribute to further development of comparative molecular cytogenetics in Rosaceae, as strawberry is
one of the best-developed model organisms for this
family [29].
The objectives of this work were to characterize the
genomic distribution of 5S and 25S rDNA arrays in Fragaria species, and to assess the changes in rDNA site
number that are associated with polyploidization in
Fragaria.

Results
Numbers of 5S and 25S rDNA sites visualized by fluorescence in situ hybridization in one or more accessions
of each studied taxon are shown (Table 1). For each
accession, at least five cells with good chromosome
spreads and hybridization signals were observed. In all
the species including the diploids and polyploids, 5S
rDNA sites were all localized on proximal regions of
short chromosome arms, and 25S rDNA sites were all
localized on terminal chromosomal regions. The site
numbers of both rDNA types was consistent within
each level of ploidy, with the following exceptions. As
detailed below, five diploid cytotypes had less than the
number of 25S signals presented by the typical diploid
cytotype. The intensity and size pattern of 25S signals
displayed variability within the diploids. Also, a difference of 25S site number was observed between the two
hexaploid F. moschata (CFRA 157 and CFRA 376) genotypes. Finally, the two decaploid taxa differed from each
other in both 5S and 25S site numbers.
Genomic distribution of 5S and 25S rDNA sites in diploids

Among most diploid accessions examined, a common
distribution pattern of rDNA sites was observed, involving three chromosome pairs. In this pattern (Figures
1A-1G, Figure 2A) six 25S rDNA sites were localized on
three chromosome pairs, one of which was also marked
by a pair of 5S rDNA sites. Among these three chromosome pairs, we designated the medium-sized submetacentric pair that is “single-marked” by 25S rDNA signals
as the “M pair”. The other two marked pairs (S1 and
S2) were the smallest among the seven chromosome
pairs, and were either submeta- or subtelo-centric. A
pair of 25S rDNA signals was present on one of these
two small chromosome pairs, hereafter referred to as
the “S1 pair” (for the small-sized, “single-marked” pair),
while the small, “double-marked” pair with both 25S
and 5S sites was designated the “S2 pair” (Figure 2).
Besides the typical pattern shared by most diploid
strawberries, some distinct patterns involving reduced
numbers of 25S sites were seen (Figure 2). The S2 pair
typically carrying both 5S and 25S rDNA sites lacked
the 25S FISH signal on both homologs in all examined
cells of F. vesca subsp. vesca ’Yellow Wonder’, leaving
this accession with only four 25S signals along with two
5S signals (Figures 1K and 2C). Among the diploid
accessions, only ‘Yellow Wonder’ did not have any chromosomes double marked by 25S and 5S rDNA signals
(Table 1). In a parallel case, it was the typically singlemarked S1 pair that lacked the 25S FISH signal on both
homologs (Figures 1H and 2F) in F. nilgerrensis (CFRA
1358 and CFRA 1825). Contrastingly, only one homolog
of the S1 pair lacked a 25S signal in all examined cells

in F. nipponica (CFRA 1862, Figures 1I and 2E). Also,
although six 25S signals were observed in F. iinumae
(CFRA 1850, Figure 1G), the signal on one member of
the S1 pair was variable among cells, ranging from very
small (cells 1 to 3 in Figure 2D) to extremely weak (cell
4 in Figure 2D), and to even invisible (cell 5 in Figure
2D). Finally, in F. vesca subsp. americana ’Pawtuckaway’
(CFRA 1948) only one member of the S2 pair had a 25S
signal in 24 out of 26 cells (Figures 1J and 2B), while in
the other two cells, both S2 homologs had 25S signals
(e.g., cell 5 in Figure 2B).
In most diploid accessions, remarkable variability in
signal size and intensity was observed among the three

25S rDNA loci as well as between homologs at each 25S
locus. (Figures 1 and 2). Yet of the three typically
marked chromosome pairs, no one pair had consistently
the brightest or least bright 25S signals across the
diploid accessions. For instance, in F. vesca ’Hawaii 4’
the 25S rDNA FISH signals on the M pair were remarkably smaller and weaker than the ones on the S1 and S2
pairs, thus showing a “minor M - major S1 - major S2”
pattern (Figure 2A); while in F. nipponica the S1 pair
showed the smallest and weakest 25S rDNA signals,
thus presenting a “major M - minor S1 - major S2” pattern (Figure 2E). This variability in allocation patterns of
“major” and “minor” 25S rDNA signals were not only

observed among different diploid species but also
between subspecies (e.g., “minor M - major S1 - major
S2” in F. vesca subsp. vesca ’Hawaii 4’ versus “major M
- major S1 - major S2” in F. vesca subsp. americana
’Pawtuckaway’, Figures 2A and 2B), or even between different accessions within a subspecies (e.g., F. vesca
subsp. vesca ’Hawaii 4’ versus “major M - major S1 none S2” in F. vesca subsp. vesca ’Yellow Wonder’, Figures 2A and 2C). Within a single accession, on the
other hand, the allocation patterns were generally consistent among examined cells (Figure 2). Contrastingly,
one or two satellites and secondary constrictions, which
are cytological markers for transcriptional active rDNA
sites, are only sometimes visible in metaphase chromosome preparations in some diploids (Figure 1) and were
variously associated with either “major” or “minor” FISH
signals.
Number of 5S and 25S rDNA sites in polyploids

F. ×bifera is a naturally occurring hybrid species and
involves both diploid and triploid cytotypes [12]. The
accession (GS104) examined in our study was a triploid
as shown by chromosome counting. The numbers of 5S

and 25S rDNA sites in the triploid F. ×bifera were three
and nine, respectively (Figure 3A). Each of the three 5S
rDNA sites was co-localized with a 25 rDNA signal.
However, one 5S rDNA signal was obviously larger and
stronger than the other two.
The three tetraploid species shared the same numbers of rDNA sites, which were four for 5S and twelve
for 25S rDNA (Figures 3B-3D). These numbers are
twice the numbers of two 5S and six 25S sites detected
in most diploids, and each of the tetraploids’ 5S rDNA
sites was co-localized with a 25S rDNA site. Although
the number and position of rDNA sites was strictly
consistent among the tetraploids, differences in signal
size and intensity among sites were observed. In F.
gracilis (Figure 3C) and F. tibetica (Figure 3D), 25S
rDNA sites among three homologous chromosome
groups were not of noticeably different signal intensities, while in F. corymbosa (CFRA 1911, Figure 3B),
25S rDNA sites in one “single-marked” group of four
chromosomes had larger signals than those of the
other two groups. Also, among the total four 5S rDNA
sites in F. corymbosa, two were larger and stronger
than the other two.

Figure 2 Variable distribution patterns of 5S (green) and 25S (red) rDNA sites among diploid Fragaria genotypes. Five cells (numbered
1-5) are selected from each of six diploid accessions, which show divergent distribution patterns of rDNA sites. Only chromosomes displaying
(or “expected” to display) rDNA FISH signals are shown here (M: the medium-sized pair “single-marked” by 25S rDNA signals; S1: the small-sized
pair “single-marked” by 25S rDNA signals; S2: the small-sized pair “double-marked” by both 25S and 5S rDNA signals in the typical pattern). The
pattern represented by F. vesca ’Hawaii 4’ here (A) is the typical one (6 = 2M+2S1+2S2) shared by most diploid Fragaria taxa, while distinctly
divergent patterns are observed in very a few accessions shown in B. 5 = 2M+2S1+1S2 with an exception as 6 = 2M+2S1+2S2; C. 4 = 2M+2S1;
D. 6 = 2M+2S1+2S2 with an exception as 5 = 2M+1S1+2S2; E. 5 = 2M+1S1+2S2; F. 4 = 2M+2S2. Within each of most accessions, the
distribution pattern among cells is consistent, except for F. vesca ’Pawtuckaway’ and F. iinumae. In F. vesca ’Pawtuckaway’ (B), the S2 pair displays
only one 25S rDNA signal in cells 1 to 4 but two signals in cell 5. In F. iinumae (D), the S1 pair exhibits two distinct 25S rDNA signals in cells 1
to 3, one distinct and one weak signal in cell 4, and only one signal in cell 5.

In the hexaploid species F. moschata, two accessions
(CFRA 157 and CFRA 376) were examined. Although
eighteen 25S rDNA sites would be expected as a multiple of three times the number seen in most diploids,
only seventeen (in CFRA 376, Figure 3F) or sixteen (in
CFRA 157, Figure 3E) were detected. Six 5S rDNA sites
were found as anticipated in both accessions, but one of
them was not co-localized with a 25S rDNA site, and
one pair of 5S sites was always much larger and more
intensive than the other two pairs in both accessions.
We investigated seven octoploids that represent three
subspecies of F. chiloensis and three subspecies of F. virginiana, and found that each of the octoploid taxa
shared common 5S and 25S rDNA site numbers, which

were two and ten, respectively (only data for two representative taxa are shown here, in Figures 3G and 3H).
These numbers for both 5S and 25S rDNA sites were
much less than the anticipated multiples (eight and
twenty-four, respectively) of those in most diploids. In
addition, no double-marked chromosomes were
observed.
A wild genotype (CFRA 110) in F. virginiana subsp.
platypetala was found to be a decaploid by chromosome
counting [7]. Our work on the same accession confirmed the ploidy characterization of CFRA 110 by
showing 70 chromosomes in a mitotic spread. FISH
study detected four 5S and fifteen 25S rDNA sites distributed over 18 chromosomes, of which one was

double-marked by a 25S and a 5S rDNA signal (Figure
3I). In F. iturupensis, the other natural decaploid species
found so far in this genus, six 5S and twelve 25S rDNA
sites were detected over eighteen chromosomes, and no
chromosome was double-marked (Figure 3J). Both decaploids also presented variable signal sizes and intensities
among 5S rDNA sites.

Discussion
Molecular cytogenetic analysis of ribosomal RNA genes
by FISH has been performed in many plants, yet studies spanning an extensive polyploid series and

encompassing most of the species within a genus are
quite rare. In the strawberry genus Fragaria, prior to
our initial report on F. vesca subsp. vesca ’Hawaii 4’ in
Shulaev et al. [28], only one unspecified accession of
one diploid species, F. vesca, had been studied [27]. In
the present investigation, nine of the 12 known diploid
species as well as several polyploid taxa were studied
for genomic distribution of rDNA sites. In total, we
extended chromosomal localization of both 5S and 25S
rDNA clusters via FISH to 33 accessions representing
25 taxa (species and subspecies), covering ploidy levels
from diploid to decaploid.

Liu and Davis BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:157
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/157

In all the Fragaria species and subspecies examined
here, the 5S rDNA signals were displayed in proximal
regions of chromosome short arms, while the 25S rDNA
signals were on terminal chromosomal regions, indicating that the chromosomal positions of rDNA sites are
highly conserved across Fragaria. Yet, as detailed below,
marked variations in signal intensity were observed
among diploid taxa, and intriguing instances and patterns of signal loss were observed, both within and
between ploidy levels.
Typical and exceptional distribution patterns of 5S and
25S rDNA sites among diploid strawberry species

Among and within diploid taxa, the observation of two
5S and six 25S rDNA sites by FISH analysis (Figure 1)
was generally consistent with previous findings in F.
vesca [27,28]. Thus, at the diploid level, one copy of the
basic (x = 7) Fragaria genome is typified by the detectable presence of one 5S locus and three 25S loci, distributed such that one chromosome is “double-marked” by
a proximal 5S rDNA locus and a terminal 25S rDNA
locus, and two chromosomes are “single-marked” by
terminal 25S rDNA loci (Figure 2A). By reasonable
inference from its typicality, the described pattern may
represent that of the ancestral Fragaria genome.
Among diploids, the greatest departures from the typical pattern were two distinct instances of rDNA site
loss, each involving a different locus. First, absence of
the 25S rDNA signals from the S1 pair left both accessions of F. nilgerrensis with only four 25S signals (e.g.,
CFRA 1358 in Figure 2F). This divergence of F. nilgerrensis from the other diploid species contributes to its
status as a well-differentiated evolutionary unit, as suggested by the phylogenetic studies of Rousseau-Gueutin
et al. [13] and Harrison et al. [30], and also by the sterility of the hybrids resulting from its crosses with other
Fragaria species [31]. Second, F. vesca ’Yellow Wonder’
also displayed only four 25S signals, but the site losses
were from the S2 pair (Figure 2C), also making ‘Yellow
Wonder’ distinct among diploid taxa, including the
other studied genotypes of F. vesca subsp. vesca. Thus,
diminution of 25S rDNA site number from six to four
has occurred at least twice among diploid Fragaria.
Polymorphisms were also detected in size and intensity of 25S rDNA FISH signals, which we described as
“major” (large and strong) and “minor” (small and weak)
signals, between different loci in the various diploid
taxa. Yet of the three typically marked chromosome
pairs, no one pair had consistently the brightest or least
bright 25S signals across the diploid genotypes. Thus, in
contrast to the conservation of a typical pattern of
rDNA site distribution, the allocation pattern of 25S
rDNA signal intensities among chromosome pairs varied
among diploid genotypes to an extent that precluded

typification. Furthermore, polymorphism in signal intensity and/or presence versus absence was observed
between homologous 25S rDNA sites in many diploid
genotypes. Signal absences from one but not both members of a typically marked pair occurred in three cases:
F. nipponica (Figure 2E), F. iinumae (Figure 2D), and a
genotype (’Pawtuckaway’) of F. vesca subsp. americana
(Figure 2B). The latter pattern of variability between
homologs was consistently seen on separately prepared
slides suggesting that this variability was not due to
experimental artifact. Based upon available data, it
would be premature to speculate about the possibility
that unbalanced signal intensity between homologs is a
precursor to eventual locus loss, culminating in a
diminution of 25S site number from the typical six to
four. However, all the variations summarized above indicate that the 25S rDNA arrays in diploid Fragaria exist
in a dynamic state.
Characterization of 25S rDNA arrays in diploid
strawberries: conservation of site number and
chromosomal position vs. dynamics of copy number

As FISH is considered to be a semi-quantitative technique [32], it is reasonable to expect that size and intensity of hybridization signals is an indicator of targeted
sequence copy number. Thus, the polymorphism of 25S
rDNA signal intensities revealed among diploid Fragaria
may imply different repeat copy numbers among different rDNA sites. Loss of 25S rDNA signal(s) could be
due to a complete elimination of entire sites, or perhaps
only to the loss of most copies of 25S rDNA repeats at
the respective site(s), resulting in a diminished signal or
leaving too few repeats to be detected by FISH. Such
outcomes could be attributable to spontaneous deletion
of an rDNA-containing fragment from the short arm of
the chromosome(s) [33], or to unequal crossing over,
which could lead to a loss (and/or gain) of repeats from
different sites [34].
Any rDNA site is a stretch of DNA with sequence
homology to other rDNA sites on other chromosomes
[35]. Thus, physical association of rDNA clusters
between both homologous and nonhomologous sites is
possible, supported by the fact that rDNA-bearing chromosomes appear to be non-randomly associated with
each other at mitotic metaphase [36]. It is widely
accepted that association of genes with highly repetitive
sequences would increase the opportunity for unequal
exchanges. The distal chromosomal position of rDNA
sites in strawberry may facilitate this association, which
could lead to unequal exchanges and rDNA repeat
duplications/deletions, and therefore changes (both
increases and decreases) in copy number between both
homologous and nonhomologous sites. Size polymorphism of the hybridization signals, among and within

Liu and Davis BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:157
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/157

homologous sites could be explained by such events. On
the other hand, somatic exchanges taking place between
different sites could make homogenization and changes
in rDNA copy number occur especially quickly [36].
Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that the rDNA
repeats in strawberry are in a highly dynamic state
because of their terminal positions and potentially high
degree of association between sites. However, the high
conservation in rDNA site number and chromosomal
location, despite their apparent high dynamics of copy
number among sites, may indicate conserved genome
organization among strawberry species, at least for chromosomal segments involving rDNA sites.
When more than one pair of 18S-25S rDNA sites is
present in the genome, some sites may be inactive [34].
When sites are active, a secondary constriction is typically visible. Once genes are inactivated (silenced), the
constriction disappears, even though the sequence is
still present and detectable by FISH [37]. In strawberry,
satellites have been reported on a small pair of chromosomes in five diploid species in previous karyotype studies [23,24]. In our work, one or two satellites and
secondary constrictions are sometimes visible in metaphase chromosome preparations in some diploids (Figure 1), and were always associated with a 25S rDNA
FISH signal, irrespective of signal size. In reports on
some plants, active rDNA clusters that can form nucleolar organization regions (NORs) and produce large and
intensive FISH signals have been described as major
loci, while the ones without transcription activity but
are still detectable by FISH as weak signals are described
as minor loci (e.g., Hordeum) [38]. So far, whether all or
only some of the rDNA sites in strawberry are actively
transcribed and form NORs awaits resolution by further
work. The terms “major/minor sites” applied in the
Results section are not intended to refer to the transcriptional activity of rDNA sites, but only to relative
signal brightness.
Proportional increase of rDNA site number in lower (3x 6x) polyploid strawberries

The triploid cytotype of the hybrid F. ×bifera was previously inferred to possess one copy of the F. vesca genome and two copies of the F. viridis genome [12]. Three
5S and nine 25S rDNA sites observed in this triploid
cytotype constitute simple multiples of both rDNA site
numbers in its two diploid progenitors. The one larger
and stronger 5S rDNA site is probably from F. vesca,
while the two smaller ones are from F. viridis, in consideration of the copy number of subgenomes provided by
the two donors.
In three tetraploids, multiples of 5S and 25S rDNA
site numbers (Figure 3B-3D) are increased in proportion
to the increase in whole genome copy number (i.e., in

Page 8 of 13

comparison to the typical diploids, the tetraploids had
twice as many chromosomes and twice as many
detected 5S and 25S rDNA sites). To date, the alternate
possibilities of auto- or allo- polyploidy origin have not
been resolved in these tetraploids [13]. Various diploid
species occurring in respectively overlapping geographical areas have been proposed as putative ancestors. Due
to the highly conserved genomic distribution pattern of
rDNA sites among diploids, no specific species were
identifiable as putative ancestors of the tetraploids based
on rDNA-FISH data. However, variable allocation of
25S rDNA signal intensities among loci between these
tetraploids at least implies that the diploid ancestry of F.
corymbosa may be distinct from those of either F. gracilis or F. tibetica. Lundberg et al. [39] suggested that F.
corymbosa was an allotetraploid. The size polymorphism
of 5S rDNA signals in F. corymbosa observed in our
work is possibly supportive to this hypothesis.
In the hexaploid species F. moschata, six 5S and eighteen 25S rDNA sites would be expected as three times
those in most diploids. In fact, six 5S rDNA sites
appeared as distinct FISH signals, but one or two fewer
signals for 25S rDNA sites were shown in, respectively,
F. moschata genotypes CFRA 376 and CFRA 157 (Figure
3E and 3F). F. moschata was shown to be an allopolyploid and its subgenome donors include F. vesca and F.
viridis, which were suggested by DNA molecular studies
[13,39,40]. In F. vesca, some genotypes (e.g., ‘Yellow
Wonder’ and ‘Pawtuckaway’) have fewer 25S rDNA sites
than six. Thus, the 25S rDNA site number less than
eighteen in a hexaploid would not be surprising, if any
F. vesca genotype(s) having less than six 25S rDNA sites
were involved in its origin. Alternatively, one or two
rDNA sites could have been diminished or lost by loss
of most or all of its repeats during or after the arising of
the hexaploid. When Rousseau-Gueutin et al. [13] studied two low-copy gene sequences for the construction
of phylogenetic trees of Fragaria species, they linked F.
moschata to both F. vesca and F. viridis in the tree
based on the sequence analysis of the gene GBSSI-2, but
detected no affinity between F. moschata and F. viridis
in the tree from the DHAR gene, for which physical
elimination of one homoeologous copy of this gene was
proposed to be a possible reason.
In genotype CFRA 157, five of the six 5S rDNA sites
are co-localized with 25S rDNA sites, which means loss
of one 25S rDNA site (if the latter hypothesis discussed
above is true) has occurred on one of the six “doublemarked” chromosomes and the second one on a “singlemarked” chromosome. These two chromosomes could
not be homologs, suggesting that elimination of 25S
rDNA sites could occur simultaneously on non-homologous chromosomes. Therefore, in species with a high
site number, loss of rDNA copies could proceed very

Liu and Davis BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:157
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/157

quickly simply because there are many opportunities for
occurrence of this event. This speculation gains support
from the cases of octo- and deca-ploid strawberries, in
which eight 5S and twenty-four 25S rDNA sites, and ten
5S and thirty 25S rDNA sites, respectively, would be
expected but much less are actually observed.
Remarkable rDNA site number reduction in octoploid
strawberries

Each of the two wild octoploid species includes multiple
subspecies. In this work, we examined three subspecies
of F. chiloensis and of F. virginiana, respectively. Numbers of 5S and 25S rDNA sites are consistent among all
these subspecies, and a strong reduction in rDNA site
number for both kinds of rDNA was observed as compared with proportionate multiples of the typical diploid
numbers. The strong reduction in rDNA site number
might be attributable to two factors. First, more than a
half of the rDNA sites inherited from the lower-ploidy
ancestors might have failed to participate in associations
occurring among other rDNA-bearing chromosomes,
where homogenization through unequal crossing-over
and gene conversion could have maintained homology
of their DNA sequences and therefore their transcriptional function. Thus, susceptibility to loss of some
rDNA arrays may be due simply to the high initial number of rDNA sites. Though rDNA site number is
expected to be correlated with genome size, perhaps
only a restricted number of rDNA sites under a certain
threshold could be associated together and be maintained in homology, and this low number might be sufficient to support normal cellular activity. Thus, extra
sites beyond that restricted or necessary number would
suffer accumulation of mutations from lack of homogenization forces, and be subject to elimination.
A second possibility is nucleolar dominance, as originally described by Navashin [41] in some species of Crepis. This phenomenon occasionally occurs in natural
allopolyploids as well as synthetic interspecific hybrids
[42], which show exclusive transcriptional activity of
genes encoding 18S, 5.8S, and 25S rRNA that belong to
one of the parental genomes with concurrent lack of
expression of rDNA from the other parental genome
[43]. However, how fast one of the parental rDNA
repeat types may be removed from the hybrid genome
and by what evolutionary forces is currently unresolved.
If nucleolar dominance also occurs in strawberry, loss of
rDNA sites could be explained as occurring after loss of
the transcriptional activity of these sites.
As an explanation for rDNA site loss, the hypothesis
based on nucleolar dominance could be integrated with
that of high initial copy number if association of rDNA
sites is demonstrated to occur only between those
derived from a subset of the diploid ancestors. Although

Page 9 of 13

genome composition of octoploid strawberries has not
been fully elucidated [44], putative subgenome donors
including ancestors of F. vesca and F. iinumae have
been strongly supported by phylogenetic analysis on
DNA sequence data of multiple nuclear genes [1,13],
whereas in the phylogenetic tree constructed on nuclear
ITS sequences [45], F. iinumae is not clustered with any
octoploids but is a sister species to all the others. As
nuclear ITS is included in the 45S rDNA unit, it is reasonable to speculate that rDNA site loss could be subgenome-specific and that rDNA repeats from the ancestral
F. iinumae subgenome(s) were lost during or after the
establishment of the ancestral octoploid(s).
Davis et al. [46] noticed the evident diminution of
genome size by 12% to 16% in two octoploid cultivars
as compared with an expectation of four times the size
of a diploid genome. This diminished size could be due
to events, such as losses of DNA segments, that
occurred during or after the origination of the octoploids [46]. The marked loss of rDNA sites in octoploids
could have been a part of a broader, generalized loss of
DNA segments, or could have occurred via a separate
and distinct mechanism.
Origins of higher ploidy strawberries

Identical site numbers of both 5S and 25S rDNA among
all the octoploid subspecies of F. chiloensis and F. virginiana suggest that the wild octoploid species are closely related and very likely share a common genome
composition or even have a common ancestor, as proposed by phylogenetic analysis based on different DNA
sequences [13,30,45]. Moreover, conservation of 5S and
25S rDNA site numbers among the octoploid species
and subspecies suggests that site loss to observed levels
may have been an early event, preceding the divergence
of the various octoploid taxa from a common octoploid
ancestor. The origin of F. moschata may have followed
an independent and perhaps more recent evolutionary
pathway as compared with the octoploid lineage(s),
given that F. moschata still “maintains” most of its
rDNA sites.
The presence of four 5S and fifteen 25S rDNA sites
suggests that the decaploid cytotype for CFRA 110 of
the F. virginiana subsp. platypetala originated from
doubling of an interspecific hybrid between an octoploid
and a diploid species, which are probably F. virginiana
and an American subspecies of F. vesca, respectively,
due to the North American geographic collection site of
CFRA 110. Thus, this decaploid cytotype could be comprised of two 5S and five 25S rDNA sites from the F.
vesca progenitor, and two 5S and ten 25S rDNA sites
from the octoploid progenitor. Contrastingly, the site
numbers of six for 5S and twelve for 25S rDNA in decaploid F. iturupensis do not fit an origination model

Liu and Davis BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:157
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/157

involving a simple combination of an octoploid and a
diploid. In such an origin, the decaploid would be
expected to have fewer (four) 5S sites and more (15 or
16) 25S sites, as seen in decaploid CFRA 110. Instead,
the rDNA site numbers in F. iturupensis imply a different and probably more complex origin of this decaploid
species as compared with CFRA 110.
Identification of individual chromosomes by rDNA
markers

Due to the extremely small size (i.e., 0.61-1.85 μm for
strawberry) [25] and morphologically minimal differentiation of Fragaria chromosomes, chromosome-specific
markers provided by FISH are needed for the identification of individual chromosomes, and are critical for
tracking homo- or homoeo-logous chromosomes among
species and in polyploids.
A previous rDNA-FISH technique performed on F.
vesca enabled the construction of a karyotype with three
pairs of marked chromosomes in diploid strawberry
[27]. Confirmatory results were obtained in our lab
recently on F. vesca ’Hawaii 4’ [28]. For most accessions
of F. vesca, our data presented here are congruent with
the two previous studies. Among the three pairs of
chromosomes with rDNA markers, one pair is double
marked by 25S and 5S rDNA, and the other two single
marked pairs can be distinguished by their different size
and/or signal intensities of 25S sites they bear. The
other eight chromosomes in a diploid complement are
still challenging for even matching of homologs, except
for the largest pair, which can be grouped by its size in
most cells. To date, various genomic resources for F.
vesca including a fosmid library [47], mapped and annotated fosmid clones [10], a BAC library [48], and the
draft ‘Hawaii 4’ genome [28] have been established.
Assembly has been anchored to the genetic linkage map
into seven pseudochromosomes. These all give good
opportunities for developing new, chromosome-specific
probes that can expand the scope of karyotypic resolution in Fragaria.
We established several fosmid clones for identification
of more individual chromosomes besides the rDNA
marked ones in F. vesca (unpublished data). A comprehensive molecular karyotype in strawberry could be constructed. By finding sequence homology between 25S
and 5S rDNA probes used for chromosome identification and scaffolds mapped to the pseudochromosomes
of the ‘Hawaii 4’ linkage map, the chromosome pair
double marked by 25S and 5S rDNA sites and the other
small chromosome pair single marked by 25S rDNA signals correspond to pseudochromosome VII and pseudochromosome VI, respectively [28]. As additional probes
are developed, the seven linkage groups or pseudochromosomes will be assigned to each specific chromosome

Page 10 of 13

so that any sequences of interest defined in a certain
pseudochromosome could be verified cytologically along
real chromosomes with the assistance of chromosomespecific landmarks in the comprehensive molecular
karyotype.
rDNA site numbers in the Rosaceae family

Physical mapping of rDNA sites by FISH has been performed in several genera of the Rosaceae family, but
very few species have been examined within each of
these genera. In overview, the number of detected 25S
rDNA sites in diploid rosaceous species has been either
two (in Rosa and Rubus parvifolius) [49-52], four [49],
or six (in Prunus) [53-55]. Apple (Malus x domestica),
in which a relatively recent genome-wide duplication is
indicated [56], has a distinctively high chromosome
number of 2n = 34 in Rosaceae, and eight 25S rDNA
sites were observed in it [57]. For 5S rDNA, a constant
number of two for diploids has been observed in most
of these genera except for Prunus [53,54] and Rosa
[50,52], in which four sites have been found. In terms of
chromosome position, all the rosaceous species including Fragaria exhibit a similar distribution pattern, in
which 25S rDNA repeats are clustered at terminal
regions while 5S rDNA sites are in interstitial and proximal regions of chromosomes. However, “double-marking” by both 5S and 25S rDNA as seen in Fragaria was
only reported for diploid Prunus subhirtella [54] and a
pentaploid Rosa canina [50]. Comparative molecular
cytogenetic analysis in the Rosaceae will benefit from
the development of additional probes targeting conserved sequence sites at multiple chromosomal
locations.

Conclusions
This report describes the first molecular cytological
study of comparative genome organization in Fragaria,
and reveals the extent to which the genomic distribution
of rDNA sites is conserved among and within species
and ploidy levels, as well as dynamics of 25S rDNA
repeats, in this economically important genus. Per basic
genome copy, one proximal 5S and three terminal 25S
rDNA loci were largely but not uniformly conserved in
diploids (2x) and lower polyploids (3x, 4x and 6x), but a
marked reduction in site number was seen in higher
polyploids (8x and 10x). Based upon shared genomic
distribution patterns of rDNA sites, a common origin of
the Fragaria octoploids is suggested; however, the distinctly different patterns seen in the two recently identified decaploids suggest that these originated
independently. In the Rosaceae family, Fragaria was the
first genus in which a systematic molecular cytogenetic
study has been done, thereby providing a comparator
for genomic studies in other rosaceous species that

Liu and Davis BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:157
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/157

could, for instance, reveal common or differing trends in
rDNA locus evolution following polyploidy.

Methods
Plant material

Twenty-five taxa (species and subspecies) belonging to
Fragaria were sampled (Table 1). These included 12
diploid taxa, a triploid cytotype of F. ×bifera, three tetraploid species, hexaploid F. moschata, seven octoploid
taxa, and two decaploids. In total, 33 genotypes belonging to 17 Fragaria species were examined. The geographic distributions of Fragaria are described in Folta
and Davis [1] and Hummer et al. [58].
DNA isolation and probe preparation

Total genomic DNA was isolated from 0.1 g unexpanded leaf tissue using a modified CTAB protocol [59].
The primers for PCR amplification of 25S rDNA were
designed based on 25S rDNA from Arabidopsis thaliana
[60], and their sequences were: 25SF - 5’ACGGACCAAGGAGTCTGACATG; and 25SR - 5’CGCTTTCAC
GGTTCGTATTCG. Using genomic DNA of F. vesca
’Yellow Wonder’ as a template, PCR was performed
with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, followed
by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for 20 sec, and 72°
C for 2 min, followed by a 10-min 72°C final extension.
Products were purified by ethanol precipitation and
labeled by a nick-translation reaction using biotin-16dUTP (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana). The
5S rDNA primers were as in Brown and Carlson [61]
with modifications based on the 5S rDNA sequence
from strawberry of F. vesca ’Hawaii 4’ [28], and their
sequences were: 5SP1 - 5’GAGGGATGCAACACGAGGCC; and 5SP2 - 5’CGGATGCGATCATACCAGCA. The labeling reaction was performed by PCR
using template DNA from F. vesca ’Yellow Wonder’,
and dNTPs mixed with DIG-11-dUTP (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana). The reaction was initially
denatured at 94°C for 3 min, then subjected to 30 cycles
of 94°C for 30 sec, 50°C for 20 sec, and 72°C for 1 min,
followed by a 10-min 72°C final extension.
Chromosome preparation and Fluorescence in situ
hybridization

Pretreatment of strawberry root tips was performed as
described by Nathewet et al. [25]. Then the root tips
were rinsed briefly in 0.075 M KCl and fixed in 3:1
methanol:acetic acid at 4°C for at least 24 hrs. Fixed
root tips were digested in 2% Cellulase ‘Onozuka’ RS
(Yakult Honsha, Tokyo, Japan) and 0.05% Macerozyme R-10 (Yakult Honsha, Tokyo, Japan) at 37°C for
20 min and transferred to 0.075 M KCl for 10 min.
Then the root tips were fixed in 3:1 methanol:acetic
acid at 4°C. Chromosome spreads were made by the

Page 11 of 13

smearing method as described by Liu et al. [18], and
slides were stored at -80°C until FISH analysis. FISH
experiments were carried out with some modifications
of the procedure of Liu et al. [62]. Briefly, slides were
pretreated using RNase (100 ng/ml in 2xSSC) and
pepsin (0.01% in 10 mM HCl), then denatured in 70%
formamide for 3 min at 80°C. 25S and 5S rDNA
probes in 2xSSC, 50% deionized formamide, and 10%
dextran sulphate were denatured for 8 min at 90°C,
then applied to the denatured slides and hybridized
overnight at 37°C. After post-hybridization washes,
signals were detected using streptavidin-Cy3 (Sigma)
and anti-DIG-FITC (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis,
Indiana). Slides were mounted and counterstained in
Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) containing 2 μg/ml
4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Photographs
were taken with a ZEISS Axioplan 2 Imaging fluorescence microscope equipped with AxioCam MRm
CCD camera (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and AxioVision 4.8.1 software (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). The
images were analyzed with Adobe ® Photoshop ® CS3
and treated for color contrast and uniform brightness
only. At least 5 mitotic metaphase complements per
accession were scored.
