Abstract
Background: An understanding of the relation of commensal microbiota to health is essential in preventing
disease. Here we studied the oral microbial composition of children (N = 74, aged 3 - 18 years) in natural transition
from their deciduous to a permanent dentition and related the microbial profiles to their oral health status. The
microbial composition of saliva was assessed by barcoded pyrosequencing of the V5-V6 hypervariable regions of
the 16 S rRNA, as well as by using phylogenetic microarrays.
Results: Pyrosequencing reads (126174 reads, 1045 unique sequences) represented 8 phyla and 113 higher taxa in
saliva samples. Four phyla - Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria - predominated in all
groups. The deciduous dentition harboured a higher proportion of Proteobacteria (Gammaproteobacteria,
Moraxellaceae) than Bacteroidetes, while in all other groups Bacteroidetes were at least as abundant as
Proteobacteria. Bacteroidetes (mainly genus Prevotella), Veillonellaceae family, Spirochaetes and candidate division
TM7 increased with increasing age, reflecting maturation of the microbiome driven by biological changes with age.
Microarray analysis enabled further analysis of the individual salivary microbiota. Of 350 microarray probes, 156
gave a positive signal with, on average, 77 (range 48-93) probes per individual sample.
A caries-free oral status significantly associated with the higher signal of the probes targeting Porphyromonas
catoniae and Neisseria flavescens.
Conclusions: The potential role of P. catoniae and N. flavescens as oral health markers should be assessed in largescale clinical studies. The combination of both, open-ended and targeted molecular approaches provides us with
information that will increase our understanding of the interplay between the human host and its microbiome.

Background
The oral cavity is a complex ecological niche, as is
reflected by its complex microbial community. Recent
advances in sequencing technology, such as 454 pyrosequencing, have revealed an unexpectedly high diversity
of the human oral microbiome: dental plaque pooled
from 98 healthy adults comprised about 10000 microbial
phylotypes [1]. This is an order of magnitude higher
than previously reported 700 oral microbial phylotypes
as identified by cultivation or traditional cloning and
sequencing [2].

Studies have revealed that the various sites in the oral
cavity, such as the hard dental surfaces, mucosal sites,
and anaerobic pockets, house unique microbial communities [3,4]. The oral ecological system is dramatically
influenced by chemical and physical fluctuations as a
result of food and drink intake and oral hygiene measures. Nevertheless studies performed so far have
revealed a relatively stable oral microbial community
that shows fewer differences between individuals as
compared to the skin or gastrointestinal microbiomes
[5]. The oral microbiota is intimately related to oral
health. It is generally accepted that a shift in microbial
composition is an important step in the progression of
oral disease. However, there are few studies that have
actually demonstrated this ecological shift.

For an individual, birth is a borderline between the
sterile intrauterine life and the extrauterine existence
with a continuous exposure to microorganisms [6].
Microbiota are acquired via other individuals, animals
and the local environment [7]. The microbial community is further shaped by diet and personal oral hygiene.
Here we explored the effects of natural changes in the
oral ecosystem during the transition from the deciduous
to the permanent dentition of children on the microbial
composition of their saliva. We started with an openended approach: we sequenced tagged 16 S amplicons
of pooled saliva samples using 454 pyrosequencing technology. Then, by using a phylogenetic microarray that
targets small subunit (16S) ribosomal DNA of the predominant oral microorganisms, we obtained individual
profiles of each saliva sample. To assess the relation of
the oral health status of each child with their microbial
profile, we quantified the amount of certain oral pathogens and health-associated microorganisms by using a
q-PCR technique and compared that with the obtained
epidemiological data.

Results
Clinical findings

We collected saliva from 74 children, aged 3-18 years old,
and recorded their oral health status through clinical epidemiological examinations. Of these, 35 children had at
least one sibling who also participated in the study. Children’s saliva samples were divided into groups according
to four stages of their dentition: 1) deciduous (milk) dentition, 2) early mixed dentition (only permanent front teeth
and/or the first permanent molars were erupted or were
in the process of eruption), 3) late mixed dentition (cuspids, premolars and/or second molars were in the process
of eruption) and 4) permanent dentition (Table 1).
According to their oral health status, three groups of children were defined - ‘healthy’ or caries-free children (N =
27), ‘treated’ or children who have had caries lesions in the
past and have completed their dental treatment (N = 25),
and a ‘caries’ group or children with active dental decay
present at the time of examination (N = 22). The plaque
amount (Table 1) showed a trend to decrease with

increasing age (Pearson correlation, p = 0.04, r = -0.239)
and correlated with the number of carious surfaces
(p = 0.026, r = 0.259). The highest caries experience
was observed in the group with early mixed dentition
(Table 1).
Microbiome analysis

The oral microbiota were examined by parallel pyrosequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene on a GS FLX. In a
bar-coding approach, 12 distinct pools of samples were
sequenced and analyzed - deciduous, early mixed, late
mixed, and permanent dentition at healthy, treated or
caries state. Of all reads, 130572 reads (78.3%) passed
quality filtering and 126174 reads remained after a cutoff of 5 reads per sequence was applied. On average,
10515 reads per sample pool were analyzed. A total of
1045 unique sequences were identified. The sequences
represented 8 phyla and 113 higher taxa (genus or more
inclusive taxa when sequences could not be confidently
classified to the genus level) (Additional file 1). Four
phyla - Firmicutes, Bacteriodetes, Proteobacteria and
Actinobacteria - predominated in all groups (Figure 1),
while three phyla - Fusobacteria, candidate division
TM7 incertae sedis and Spirochaetes - were found in
relatively low proportions. Representatives of the eighth
phylum, Cyanobacteria, possibly reflecting plant chloroplasts, were found only sporadically, with the highest
number of reads in the pool of late mixed dentition
with caries (Additional file 1).
The deciduous dentition harboured a relatively high proportion of Proteobacteria compared to Bacteroidetes. In
all other groups, the Bacteroidetes were found to be
more abundant than Proteobacteria. In comparison to
adult saliva [1], child saliva appears to have a higher proportion of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria and a lower
proportion of Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, TM7 (Figure 1)
and Spirochaetes at all stages of the dentition.
Representatives of the Veillonellaceae family (unclassified Veillonellaceae, Veillonella and Selenomonas) and the
genus Prevotella increased with increasing age (Figure 2),
while Carnobacteriaceae (mainly representatives of genus
Granulicatella) showed the opposite trend.

Figure 1 Relative abundance of the main bacterial phyla (99.9% of the reads) identified in saliva of children at various developmental
stages of their dentition. Average and standard deviations from three pools of samples - healthy, treated and caries - per each developmental
stage. * - Adult saliva data are added for comparison from Keijser et al. 2008 [1].

The higher proportion of Proteobacteria in the deciduous dentition than at any other stage was mainly due
to a higher proportion of Gammaproteobacteria at this
stage of dentition. The order Pseudomonadales with
Pseudomonadaceae (genus Pseudomonas) and Moraxellaceae families (genus Acinetobacter, Moraxella and
Enhydrobacter) contributed the most to this difference.
At the deciduous dentition stage, about 8% of all reads
in the healthy dentition and 4% of the reads in the
group with untreated caries belonged to genus Acinetobacter while sequences belonging to this genus were
nearly absent from all other stages (Additional file 1,
Figure 2). Other groups that also showed a higher abundance in the deciduous dentition included the Enterobacteriaceae family and the genus Aggregatibacter
within the Pasteurellaceae family.
No significant differences were observed with respect
to species richness between the different sub-groups.
Rarefaction curves however (Additional file 2) did show
a decreased estimate in species richness in children with
caries compared to healthy or treated group.

Individual phylogenic profiles of saliva

The oral microbiota were analyzed at an individual level
using a taxonomic microarray based on discriminating
regions of the small subunit (16S) ribosomal RNA gene.
Of the 350 microarray probes, 156 gave a positive signal
(signal/background ratio at least 3) in any of the samples analyzed, with, on average, 77 probes (range 48 93, s.d. 10.4) per individual sample (Additional file 3).
All samples were positive for probes targeting the phyla
Actinobacteria (genus Actinomyces and Rothia), Bacteroidetes (genus Prevotella and order Bacteroidales), Firmicutes (genus Streptococcus, Veillonella, Lactobacillus,
Granulicatella) and Fusobacteria (genus Fusobacterium).
All but one sample were positive for probes targeting
the phylum Proteobacteria. Betaproteobacteria was the
most prevalent class (genus Neisseria - in 97% of the
samples), followed by Gammaproteobacteria (genus
Haemophilus) and Epsilonproteobacteria (genus Campylobacter). Probes targeting candidate division TM7 were
positive in 40% of the samples; the probes targeting
the domain Archaea (Additional file 4: probe o1311,

designed to target Crenarchaeota, Class Thermoprotei)
were positive in 44% of the samples. The occurrence of
Pseudomonas in the group of children with deciduous
teeth was confined to one individual, and did not reflect
a common feature of the oral microbiota of this group.
To assess which probe-signals in the salivary profiles
associate with any of the groups (the stage of the dentition and the oral health status), we performed the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM analysis) [8]. No
significant associations of microarray probe signals were
found with the stage of dentition (deciduous, early or
late mixed and permanent dentition). The health status
(healthy, treated or carious) did show significant association with the signal of three probes targeting the Porphyromonas group (Additional file 4: probes o1503,
o1504, o1506; the closest match with known species P. catoniae, P. gingivalis, P. gulae, P. macacae), and one
probe targeting Neisseria flavescens (o1486) (Figure 3).
The healthy group had higher signal values of these
probes than the group with active caries.
Dimensional reduction of the salivary profile data by
principal component analysis (PCA) explained 45% of
the total variance among the individual samples by the
first three components (Figure 4A, B). Principal components PC2 and PC3 (14% and 11.4% of variation, respectively) partly discriminated the treated and carious
samples from the samples that belonged to the healthy
group. The three probes that contributed most to
this difference were the same probes identified by the
SAM analysis - probes (probe o1486, p = 0.04; probe,
o1503 p = 0.04; probe o1506, p = 0.015; ANOVA,
Games-Howell post-hoc test) targeting N. flavescens and
Porphyromonas.
In our study group, 35 children had one or more siblings (brothers or sisters) participating in this study,
representing 16 families. To quantify the similarities
between salivary microbiota profiles of siblings and
unrelated individuals we calculated the sample distance

matrix (Additional file 5) and visualized it using hierarchical clustering (Figure 5). If two sample profiles
were identical, they would receive similarity value of 1.
The average similarity between the respective family
members was 0.87 (range 0.64 - 0.96; s.d. 0.09). The
similarity between saliva profiles of unrelated children
was slightly lower than the similarity between siblings
(0.85; range 0.51 - 0.98; s.d. 0.08), but this difference
was not statistically significant (Independent samples
T-test, p = 0.275). For a few siblings, a higher similarity
score was obtained, as for example members of family
number 9 that showed nearly identical oral microbial
communities (Figure 4).
Analysis of specific microorganisms by quantitative PCR

The SAM and PCA analyses of the microarray profiles
brought forward multiple probes targeting a group of
several species within genus Porphyromonas - P. catoniae, P. gingivalis, P. macacae and P. gulae - as significantly associated with health. P. gingivalis is known as
periodontal pathogen associated with destruction of periodontal tissue, and is phylogenetically closely related to
P. catoniae. To evaluate the abundance of P. gingivalis in
saliva, we used quantitative PCR. P. gingivalis could be
detected in only 3 samples, at 1.3 × 102, 4.5 × 104 and 2.7
× 105 cells/ml saliva. Although probe o1503 was designed
to specifically target P. gingivalis in our microarray it
showed positive signal/background ratio in 98% of samples, indicating general Porphyromonas sensitivity. The
pyrosequencing data confirmed the absence (or presence
below the detection limit of the method) of P. gingivalis,
P. gulae and P. macacae in our samples: the only Porphyromonas species identified was P. catoniae, and it
belonged to relatively abundant taxa (1.2 - 5.2% of all
reads). The q-PCR data of P. catoniae showed that saliva
samples contained between 105 and 108 of P. catoniae
cells/ml saliva. The number of P. catoniae cells correlated
significantly with the signal of both Porphyromonas

(Spearman’s correlation, p < 0.001; r = 0.618, p < 0.001; r
= 0.580 respectively). Both Porphyromonas probes of the
microarray hybridized thus with P. catoniae. The number
of P. catoniae cells correlated negatively with the total
number of decayed, missing and filled (DMFS & dmfs)
surfaces (p = 0.024, r = -0.266) and, although less
strongly, also with the number of surfaces with caries
lesions (p = 0.047, r = -0.235).

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first report on the oral
microbiome of children assessed at the depth of next
generation sequencing. This open-ended and high resolution approach provided us with the overview of the
taxa present in saliva of children, next to our existing
knowledge on the adult microbiome [1,4]. Being aware
of the current discussions on the artefacts that may be
introduced by pyrosequencing [9,10], we applied a stringent protocol for filtering sequences. Through a combined approach of pyrosequencing, as well as taxonomic
microarray analysis, we showed that salivary microbiome
of children is already complex by the age of 3, and it
matures with increasing age. However, at the age of
puberty it still differs from the adult microbiome.
Although the analysis of the adult oral microbiome was
performed on a different sequencing platform (GS20),
and the forward primers differed from the ones used in
this study, this is unlikely to account for the major differences we observed.
As in previous observations, the oral microbiome was
shown to be relatively stable, despite the significant biological changes that occur during the eruption of teeth.
However, some differences were observed, with the most
striking difference between the deciduous dentition and
the rest of the stages. The children in this youngest age
group harboured groups of microorganisms that are not

usually associated with healthy commensal oral microbiota (Pseudomonadaceae, Moraxellaceae, Enterobacteriaceae) at relatively higher proportions than older children.
Although from our sequencing data it is not possible to
draw any conclusions regarding the pathogenicity, it is
known from literature that the Moraxellaceae family
member Acinetobacter - the genus that contributed most
to this difference - is considered to be a major nosocomial respiratory pathogen and has been reported at high
prevalence in dental plaque and saliva of hospitalized
individuals [11,12]. Acinetobacter baumanii is infamous
due to its multiple resistance to antibiotics [13,14]. Studies on upper respiratory tract infections in children have
found an association between recurrent tonsillopharyngitis and another member within Moraxellaceae family Moraxella catarrhalis [15]. The occurrence of Pseudomonas was shown to be confined to one individual.
In addition to the differences in their salivary microbiome, the children with deciduous teeth also had the
highest amount of dental plaque among the four groups.
Nevertheless, the prevalence and severity of inflammation of oral tissues (gingivitis and periodontitis) is low in
healthy young children and gradually increases with
increasing age [16,17]. A classic example of age-related
susceptibility to gingivitis was presented three decades
ago by an experimental gingivitis study [18]: after discontinued oral hygiene measures for 21 days, both, children and adults accumulated increasing amounts of
dental plaque while signs of gingival inflammation were
large in adults and remained negligible in children. This
age-dependence has multiple natural reasons: the biological changes in tissues around the teeth during the
eruption and exfoliation of teeth, the gradual development of the immune defence system and the endocrine
system, all contributing to the maturation of the oral
microbial communities [19]. With increasing age the
proportions of periodontal pathogens also increase
[17,20]. We confirmed the maturation of microbial composition by detecting increased proportions of Bacteroidetes (mainly genus Prevotella), Spirochaetes and
candidate division TM7 with increasing age and found
the highest abundance of these obligate anaerobes in the
adult population [1].
Due to differences in the technological platforms it is
difficult to make a direct comparison between microarray and sequencing data. The taxonomic resolution and
‘dose response’ that is offered by both technologies is
quite different and does not allow a comparison of e.g.
taxa abundance. A comparison was made using hierarchical clustering results based either on microarray or
on 454 pyrosequencing data (Figure 6). For a number of
samples a similar clustering was obtained. Three main
overlapping clusters were identified, one composed of
samples derived from the deciduous healthy and

Page 7 of 13

deciduous caries groups, a second composed of early
mixed caries, early mixed treated, late mixed treated and
late mixed caries. The third group overlapping was composed of late mixed healthy and early mixed healthy
dentition. Discrepancies were observed in the classification of the permanent healthy, treated caries groups.
Since the microarray was designed mainly aiming at
children oral microbiota, it may be that the coverage of
the current taxonomic microarray is not fully adequate
for classification of the oral microbiota associated with
permanent teeth. When zooming in further, differences
in the clustering patterns were observed, that are likely
to be due to differences in the platform technologies.
Our microarray data suggested a positive association
between the signal of the probe targeting Porphyromonas catoniae with caries-free status of children. Quantitative PCR confirmed that all children in our study
harboured P. catoniae in their saliva, and that the
amount of this species correlated negatively with the
number of decayed, missing and filled surfaces in their
oral cavity. So far there are no other reports supporting
the health association of P. catoniae in relation to dental
caries. It has however been shown that in periodontitis
patients P. catoniae is specifically associated with shallow pockets and healthy sites and not the diseased, deep
pockets [21]. Another Porphyromonas species, P. gingivalis, one of the red complex organisms associated with
periodontal disease [22], was found in only three samples by q-PCR. Other authors have also found P. gingivalis to be in low prevalence and abundance in children
[20,23].
P. catoniae (previously Oribaculum catoniae [24] and
Bacteroides D26 [25]) are saccharolytic, Gram-negative
anaerobic rods and the only non-pigmented species
among Porphyromonas. Unlike other Porphyromonas
species, P. catoniae belongs to early colonizers among
obligate anaerobes: it has been detected in two monthold pre-dentate infants, and becomes a regular colonizer once the first teeth erupt [7,26,27]. P. catoniae differs from other Porphyromonas spp. in its frequent
ability to produce ß-lactamase [28], an enzyme that
inactivates ß-lactam antibiotics. Könönen et al [7] have
hypothesized that this, on one hand, may offer a reservoir of resistance genes potentially transferable to
pathogens, while on the other hand, this may allow
commensal microorganism as P. catoniae to remain in
the oral cavity after frequent ß-lactam antibiotic
courses and prevent the overgrowth of opportunistic
pathogens.
An interesting group to include in the study was the
group of siblings. Fourteen sibling pairs, one set of three
siblings (family number 9) as well as one set of four siblings (family number 8) participated in our study. From
genotyping studies it is known that both vertical (from

mother to child) and horizontal (among siblings and
between spouses) transmission of oral microorganisms
can occur, e.g., identical P. gingivalis genotypes among
siblings were found in 26% of the sibships [29], while in
two of the three families from which strains from siblings were available, a common Streptococcus mutans
ribotype occurred in all family members [30]. Recently
even the transmission of S. mutans between unrelated
children at public schools was reported [31]. Besides
microbial transmission, host genetic factors may influence the proportions of certain species in genetically
related individuals, as has been estimated from the
genetic contributions to the increased similarity of the
microbiota of twins as compared with microbiota of
unrelated people [32,33]. In general, our study did not
find higher similarity in saliva microbial profiles among
siblings than among unrelated individuals. One exception was the family number 9, where profiles of all three
siblings were highly similar (Pearson correlation 0.950.96) (Figure 4, Additional file 5). One should interpret

our findings with caution though, since the individual
saliva profiles in our study were biased by using targeted
approach and our study was not designed to trace different genotypes. Only studies using an open-ended
approach such as individually barcoded sample pyrosequencing [4] will allow full comparisons of individual
microbiomes.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that salivary
microbiota of children aged 3 to 18 years is still in the
process of maturation and that certain oral microorganisms may be associated with caries-free oral cavities.
This study indicates the potential for further studies,
preferably longitudinal clinical trials involving large
study populations in revealing the panel of microorganisms as potential oral health markers. With that knowledge oral health professionals will be able to perform
timely interventions in the oral ecosystem to prevent
the shift from health to disease.

Methods
Study Population and Clinical Screening

Children aged 3-18 years, living in the area of Oss, the
Netherlands, and being registered at the Youth Dental
Care clinic (Jeugdtandverzorging Noordoost Noord-Brabant) participated in the study. Ethical approval was
given by the independent Medical Ethics Committee of
TNO. Inclusion criteria were good general health, no
use of antibiotics in the last 6 months, no braces and
written consent of the parents/caretakers of the child.
The children were clinically examined in the dental
clinic by one calibrated dental epidemiologist as a part
of their regular dental check-up. The oral examination
included a visual inspection of the oral mucosa, caries
experience and plaque. The caries experience was
expressed by the dmfs-index. This index was calculated
by adding up the total number of decayed, missing and
filled surfaces. Surfaces with early enamel lesions (white
spots) were registered as sound. A tooth surface was
registered as carious if caries lesion had reached dentin
or if tooth enamel was undermined by underlying lesion
resulting in at least a 0.25-mm-deep surface defect. The
amount of dental plaque (plaque index) was assessed
using criteria of Greene and Vermillion [34]. In brief,
six dental surfaces - buccal surface of both upper permanent or deciduous molars, labial surface of 11 and 31
(permanent dentition) or 51 and 71 (deciduous dentition), and lingual surface of 36 and 46 (permanent dentition) or 75 and 85 (deciduous dentition) - were
inspected. If the selected tooth was missing, the contralateral tooth or the neighbouring tooth was assessed
instead. Amount of plaque was determined visually by
moving the probe along the tooth surface. The surface
received score 0 if no plaque was visible, score 1 if plaque was present only at the cervical third of the surface,
score 2 if plaque covered a cervical half of the surface,
score 3 if plaque reached the incisal or occlusal surface
of the tooth. A mean plaque index (average score per
number of surfaces scored) was calculated per child.

AGOWA, Berlin, Germany). Then 0.3 g zirconium
beads (diameter, 0.1 mm; Biospec Products, Bartlesville,
OK, USA) and 0.2 ml phenol were added to each sample. The samples were homogenized with a Mini-beadbeater (Biospec Products) for 2 min. DNA was extracted
with the AGOWA mag Mini DNA Isolation Kit and
quantified (Nanodrop ND-1000; NanoDrop Technologies, Montchanin, DE, USA).
PCR Amplification, Sample Pooling and Pyrosequencing

PCR amplicon libraries of the small subunit ribosomal
RNA gene V5-V6 hypervariable region were generated
for the individual samples. PCR was performed using the
forward primer 785F (GGA TTA GAT ACC CBR GTA
GTC) and the reverse primer 1061R (TCA CGR CAC
GAG CTG ACG AC). The primers included the 454 Life
Sciences Adapter A (forward primer) and B (reverse primer) fused to the 5’ end of the 16 S rRNA bacterial primer sequence and a unique trinucleotide sample
identification key per each sample group. This resulted in
12 distinctly labelled pools of samples - deciduous, early
mixed, late mixed, and permanent dentition at healthy,
treated or caries state. The amplification mix contained 2
units of Pfu Ultra II Fusion HS DNA polymerase and 1×
PfuUltra II reaction buffer (Stratagene), 200 μM dNTP
PurePeak DNA polymerase Mix (Pierce Nucleic Acid
Technologies, Milwaukee, WI), and 0.2 μM of each primer. After denaturation (94°C; 2 min), 30 cycles were
performed that consisted of denaturation (94°C; 30 sec),
annealing (50°C; 40 sec), and extension (72°C; 80 sec).
DNA was isolated by means of the MinElute kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). The quality and the size of the amplicons were analyzed on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser with
the DNA 1000 Chip kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) and quantified using Nanodrop ND1000 spectrophotometer. The amplicon libraries were
pooled in equimolar amounts and sequenced unidirectionally in the reverse direction (B-adaptor) by means of
the Genome Sequencer FLX (GS-FLX) system (Roche,
Basel, Switzerland).

Sample Collection

Unstimulated saliva, as the representation of an average
sample of the whole oral ecosystem [3,4], was collected at
the day of the dental check-up, at home, before breakfast
and toothbrushing, by drooling into a DNA-free, sterile
vial for 5 minutes. The parents were instructed to store
the saliva refrigerated (4-7°C) and take the vial to the
dental clinic, i.e., within 6 h after collection.
DNA Extraction

A 0.1-ml quantity of saliva sample was transferred to
a sterile screw-cap Eppendorf tube with 0.25 ml of
lysis buffer (AGOWA mag Mini DNA Isolation Kit,

Processing of the Pyrosequencing Data

GS-FLX sequencing data were processed as previously
described [35]. In brief, we trimmed sequences by
removing primer sequences and low-quality data
(sequences that did not have an exact match to the
reverse primer, that had an ambiguous base call (N) in
the sequence, or that were shorter than 50 nt after trimming). We then used the GAST algorithm [36] to calculate the percent difference between each unique
sequence and its closest match in a database of 69816
unique eubacterial and 2779 unique archaeal V5-V6
sequences, representing 323499 SSU rRNA sequences

Crielaard et al. BMC Medical Genomics 2011, 4:22
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/4/22

from the SILVA database [37]. Taxa were assigned to
each full-length reference sequence using several sources
including Entrez Genome entries, cultured strain identities, SILVA, and the Ribosomal Database Project Classifier [38]. In cases where reads were equidistant
to multiple V5-V6 reference sequences, and/or where
identical V5-V6 sequences were derived from longer
sequences mapping to different taxa, reads were
assigned to the lowest common taxon of at least twothirds of the sequences. Only sequences that were found
at least 5 times were included in the analyses. This strict
and conservative approach was chosen to preclude
inclusion of sequences from potential contamination or
sequencing artefacts.
Probe Design for the 16S rDNA Microarray

For the design of the taxonomic microarray literature
inventory was made on the description of the normal
oral microbiota [2,3,39-41]. The literature based inventory was compared to the 454 pyrosequencing data that
were obtained in this study. While the majority of taxa
observed by 454 sequencing were already included in
the literature inventory, a number of taxonomic groups
were found to be missing. These were included in the
list. Based on the list, probes were designed using ARB
[42]. The probes were 20-22 nucleotides in size, with a
predicted melting temperature of 60°C ± 5, and a GC
level between 40 and 60%. The full list of oligonucleotides is provided in Additional file 4.
Microarray Printing

Microarrays for this study were produced in house,
using the ArrayIt Nanoprint60 Microarray Robot. The
5’-amino-modifier-C6-linked oligonucleotides were
diluted to a final concentration of 25 μM in a 50 mM
Phosphate buffer (pH 7), and printed onto CodeLink
Activated Slides. Following incubation at 80% humidity
under ambient conditions, slides were blocked in a buffer of 0.1 M Tris Base and 50 mM ethanolamine (pH 9)
for 45 minutes at 50°C while shaking in accordance with
the manufacturer’s recommendations. After that, the
slides were rinsed twice in MilliQ purified water (MilliQ,
Millipore), washed in 4 × SSC (600 mM sodium chloride/60 mM sodium citrate), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS) for 30 minutes at 50°C, and washed in prewarmed (50°C) MilliQ water. Following that, the slides
were washed twice in MilliQ water at a room temperature, and dried under a stream of nitrogen. Slides were
stored under nitrogen until use.
DNA Labelling and Hybridization

For taxonomic microarray analysis, 16 S rDNA was
amplified by PCR as described above, using forward

Page 10 of 13

primers 8F (AGA GTT TGA TCH TGG YTC AG) and
8F-bif (TGG CTC AGG ATG AAC GCT G) and reverse
primer 1061R (TCA CGR CAC GAG CTG ACG AC).
Following PCR amplification, DNA was amplified by
random Klenow amplification with the BioPrime DNA
Amplification kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Klenow-amplified DNA was
passed through an Illustra AutoSeq G-50 column (GE
Healthcare G50) for purification and concentrated in a
speedvac. Following, the DNA was labelled by Terminal
Transferase coupling of Cy3-dUTP (Promega). Following
Illustra AutoSeq G-50 column purification, and vacuum
concentration, the labelled DNA was dissolved in 40 μl
Easyhyb hybridization buffer (Roche), and denatured for
2 min at 95°C. Printed slides were pre-hybridized in
0.45 μm-filtered pre-hybridization buffer [1% BSA, 5 ×
SSC, and 0.1% SDS] at 42°C for 45 min with rotation,
then washed twice with MilliQ purified water, dried
with nitrogen, and pre-warmed at 42°C. The microarrays
were placed in the ProPlate multi-array system (Grace
Bio-Labs). The hybridization mixture was then pipetted
in the individual wells, and incubated in a hybridization
chamber for four hours. Following hybridization, slides
were then thoroughly washed sequentially in 1 × SSC,
0.2% SDS for 10 sec at 37°C, 0.5 × SSC for 10 sec at 37°
C, and twice in 0.2 × SSC for 10 min at room temperature. Slides were dried with nitrogen and scanned using
a Scanarray Express 680013 Microarray Analysis System
(Perkin Elmers Life Analytical Sciences Inc.). Images
were obtained and quantified with ImaGene 4.2 software
(Biodiscovery).
Microarray validation

To validate microarray performance, a number of tests
were performed. These included: 1) Replicated analysis
of samples to test robustness of microarray data; 2)
Spiking DNA of underrepresented species to a complex
mixture followed by microarray analysis; 3) performing
a direct comparison between qPCR and microarray data,
and 4) performing a direct comparison between sequencing and microarray data.
Replicated Analysis

Technical replicates were included to verify robustness
of data. In the examples described below, three replicates were compared. Two were analyzed on slides of
the same printing series - sMF02-11, and one was analyzed on an older slide series (sMF02-9). The Pearson
correlation (r) between the three microarray analyses
was high, and varied between 0.91 and 0.93, and was
independent of the slide series. For comparison, correlation between different saliva samples ranged from 0.4
to 0.7.

Crielaard et al. BMC Medical Genomics 2011, 4:22
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1755-8794/4/22

DNA Spiking

To test the performance of the microarray with the complex oral microbial community, we performed a spiking
experiment. For this, DNA was isolated from saliva samples of a healthy adult donor as well as from pure cultures of Lactobacillus casei (ATCC 334). Following, DNA
was quantified, and pure culture DNA was added to saliva DNA at levels ranging between 0.01 and 1% of the
total community. Then the DNA was labelled, and used
to hybridize the microarray. A clear signal was detected
in all spiked samples for the L. casei spot on the microarray in a dose responsive manner. At the family level, also
a significant dose responsive increase in microarray spot
intensity was detected (with lower sensitivity).
Direct Comparison between qPCR and Microarray Data

A third method for validating microarray data was by
cross comparing species levels established by quantitative
PCR with the results obtained using the microarray. In
the current study, this was performed for Porphyromonas
catoniae in saliva samples obtained from the children.
During the study, 74 saliva samples were analyzed. The
q-PCR data of P. catoniae showed that saliva samples
contained between 105 and 108 of P. catoniae cells/ml
saliva. The fluorescence intensity for the P. catoniae
probes on the microarray ranged between 0 and 110. The
number of P. catoniae cells correlated significantly with
the signal of both Porphyromonas probes - o1503 and
o1506. The Spearman’s correlations were p < 0.001; r =
0.618 and p < 0.001; r = 0.580, respectively.
Direct Comparison between Sequencing and Microarray
Data

To enable a direct comparison between microarray and
sequencing data, both data sets were coupled by using the
probe and sequence data. For this, a string search was
used to identify matching probe sequences within the 454
pyrosequencing data. For 26 probes a direct match was
identified. This relatively low number of matching probe
sequences is due to the fact that the pyrosequencing data
span the V5-V6 region, while the majority of probes were
defined in the V2, V3 and V4 region of the 16 S ribosomal
gene. We then calculated the Pearson correlation between
the microarray and 454 sequencing data. Good (r = 0.85)
to excellent (p > 0.9) correlation was found for probes corresponding to relatively abundant taxa (>0.1% of all reads;
signal/background fluorescence value >20). The correlation for less abundant species was weak. No false positive
probes were found. Only two probes (o1402 and o1445)
were classified as false negatives.
Targeting of specific microorganisms by quantitative PCR

Quantitative PCR was performed on the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. The total

Page 11 of 13

microbial load was determined using the universal primer set described by Nadkarni et al [43]. The P. catoniae and P. gingivalis primer-probe sets were designed
using Primer Express (Applied Biosystems). To quantify
P. catoniae, the primer-probe set of P. catoniae-16S-F
(CGG TTG CCA TCAG GTA ATG C), P. catoniae16S-R (CAC CTT CCT CAC GCC TTA CG) and P.
catoniae-16S-probe (TCC GTA GAG ACT GCC G), a
minor-groove binding probe (MGB) labeled with 6-carboxy-fluorescein (FAM) was used. The P. gingivalis primer-probe set was composed of P. gingivalis-16S-F
(GCG CTCA ACG TTC AGC C), P. gingivalis-16S-R
(CAC GAA TTC CGC CTG C) and the FAM labeled
minor-groove binding (MGB) probe P. gingivalis-16Sprobe (CAC TGA ACT CAA GCC CGG CAG TTT
CAA). Quantitative PCR was performed using the Diagenode Universal Mastermix, in accordance with the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Standard controls
included a serial dilution series of purified genomic
DNA of P. gingivalis ATCC BAA-308 and P. catoniae
ATCC 51270.
Statistical analyses

To identify the probes that contribute significantly to
the different response variables (oral health status, the
stage of dentition), we performed the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM analysis) - a non-parametric
statistical technique for finding significant differences
between microarray data that are grouped based on
experimental conditions [8]. To reduce the dimensions
of the array data we performed the principal component
analysis (PCA). Similarities among individual sample
profiles were calculated using the sample distance
matrix. The SAM and PCA analyses were performed
using the MeV software package, as part of the TM4
microarray software suite [44]. The sample distance
matrix was calculated using Pearson correlation coefficient and visualized using hierarchical clustering with
the average linkage method. Independent samples Ttest, Pearson and Spearman correlations were calculated
using SPSS (Version 17.0). Abundances of probes that
showed significant differences in SAM and contributed
most to the PCA were tested by ANOVA, GamesHowell post-hoc test using SPSS (Version 17.0).
