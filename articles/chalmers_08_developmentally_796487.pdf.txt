Abstract
Background: The Sperm-coating protein/Tpx-1/Ag5/PR-1/Sc7 (SCP/TAPS) domain is found
across phyla and is a major structural feature of insect allergens, mammalian sperm proteins and
parasitic nematode secreted molecules. Proteins containing this domain are implicated in diverse
biological activities and may be important for chronic host/parasite interactions.
Results: We report the first description of an SCP/TAPS gene family (Schistosoma mansoni venom
allergen-like (SmVALs)) in the medically important Platyhelminthes (class Trematoda) and describe
individual members' phylogenetic relationships, genomic organization and life cycle expression
profiles. Twenty-eight SmVALs with complete SCP/TAPS domains were identified and comparison
of their predicted protein features and gene structures indicated the presence of two distinct subfamilies (group 1 & group 2). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this group 1/group 2 split is
zoologically widespread as it exists across the metazoan sub-kingdom. Chromosomal localisation
and PCR analysis, coupled to inspection of the current S. mansoni genomic assembly, revealed that
many of the SmVAL genes are spatially linked throughout the genome. Quantitative lifecycle
expression profiling demonstrated distinct SmVAL expression patterns, including transcripts
specifically associated with lifestages involved in definitive host invasion, transcripts restricted to
lifestages involved in the invasion of the intermediate host and transcripts ubiquitously expressed.
Analysis of SmVAL6 transcript diversity demonstrated statistically significant, developmentally
regulated, alternative splicing.
Conclusion: Our results highlight the existence of two distinct SCP/TAPS protein types within
the Platyhelminthes and across taxa. The extensive lifecycle expression analysis indicates several
SmVAL transcripts are upregulated in infective stages of the parasite, suggesting that these
particular protein products may be linked to the establishment of chronic host/parasite
interactions.

Background
Schistosomes are dioecious metazoan parasites of the
phylum Platyhelminthes, which are estimated to infect
more than 200 million people worldwide, with a further
600 million individuals living in the tropics and sub-tropics at risk of infection. The deposition of schistosome eggs
within host tissues and the subsequent immune response
elicited are the principal causes of chronic schistosomiasis, which can lead to a range of morbidities such as periportal fibrosis and granulomatous inflammation [1].
Despite the availability of a highly effective chemotherapeutic agent (praziquantel), recent reassessment of disease-related morbidity shows schistosomiasis to be a far
greater public health problem than previously estimated
[2]. This reappraisal of the impact of schistosomiasis and
the potential emergence of praziquantel-resistant strains
argues strongly for the identification and characterisation
of novel vaccine and drug targets.
Schistosoma mansoni is one of three schistosome species
that cause the vast majority of human infections and is the
most extensively studied in the laboratory. Large-scale
sequencing projects have created extensive S. mansoni
expressed sequence tag (EST) and genomic databases
leading to the identification of thousands of new genes, as
well as providing a repository of information useful for
post-genomic activities [3,4]. In our search for novel
chemotherapeutic and immunoprophylactic targets, we
have utilised these sequence databases for construction of
DNA microarrays to identify gender-associated and developmentally-regulated S. mansoni transcripts [5,6]. One
interesting finding from these investigations was the identification of two adult male-associated transcripts bearing
sequence similarity to the SCP/Tpx-1/Ag 5/Pr-1/Sc7 (SCP/
TAPS) family.
Members of the SCP/TAPS family (Pfam accession
number no. PF00188; [7]) encode structurally related proteins found throughout the eukaryotic kingdom. All
members contain a unique SCP/TAPS protein domain,
which varies in length between 120 and 170 amino acids.
Tertiary structural studies have demonstrated that this
domain adopts a highly conserved α-β-α sandwich conformation [8-13]. The strong conservation of the tertiary
structure and of particular residues within the domain
have suggested that all SCP/TAPS domain containing proteins share a common biological activity [9]. However, no
specific function has yet been ascribed to the SCP/TAPS
domain, despite some biological roles having been linked
to member proteins within the superfamily. Specifically,
superfamily members have been linked to diverse processes including immune responses [14-16], testis/sperm
development [7,17], envenomation [18-20] and parasitic
nematode invasion of definitive hosts [21-23].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/89

Collectively these data suggest that SCP/TAPS proteins
participate in various biological activities across phyla
and, as such, warrant further study in the Platyhelminthes
as potential modulators of immune function, components of sexual development and candidates for novel vaccine strategies. Towards this end, we present the molecular
characterisation of 13 SCP/TAPS family members in S.
mansoni, hereafter referred to as Schistosoma mansoni
Venom allergen-like 1–13 (SmVAL1-13). We additionally
describe a further 15 members of the SmVAL family predicted in the most recent S. mansoni genome assembly
[24] and confirm the transcription of eleven of these. Our
comparison of the 28 genes provides evidence for the partitioning of the SmVAL family into two groups based on
phylogenetic analysis, genomic structure comparison and
specific protein feature inclusion. Furthermore, examples
of both group 1 and group 2 SCP/TAPS protein types are
identified in several metazoan species, supporting an evolutionarily conserved superfamily division across phyla.
Analysis of SmVAL1-13 transcription across the schistosome lifecycle demonstrates a range of distinct expression
patterns, with a subset exhibiting transcription tightly
associated with the invasive stages of the parasite. The proposed functional role of individual SmVAL family members in host/parasite interactions and parasite-specific
activities is discussed.

Results
cDNA cloning and identification of SmVAL family members
To identify S. mansoni SCP/TAPS domain-containing family members, the Vespula vulgaris Wasp Venom Allergen 5
(Ves v 5, [Genbank:AAA30333]) protein sequence was
used in a tBLASTn search of S. mansoni ESTs and Phat [25]
predicted genes from version 1 of the publicly available S.
mansoni genomic database [24]. Thirteen different members with significant sequence similarity to Ves v 5 were
identified, twelve originating from EST contigs and one
from a Phat predicted gene. After PCR confirmation of the
sequences from parasite-derived cDNA, these transcripts
were named Schistosoma mansoni Venom allergen-like
transcripts (SmVAL1-13). The molecular details of these
thirteen sequences are shown in Table 1. The available
Hidden-Markov Model (HMM) consensus of the SCP/
TAPS domain (PF00188; [26]) was subsequently used in
a search of the most recent release of the genomic database (version 4). This identified 15 additional family
members with complete SCP/TAPS domains, and a further 7 with incomplete SCP/TAPS domains. The molecular details of these sequences are shown in Table 2.

Complete open-reading frames (ORFs) for SmVAL1-13
were predicted by inspection of genomic sequence data,
and these representative members (out of the total 28
with full SCP/TAPS domains) were confirmed by PCR
amplification from parasite-derived cDNA. Additional

presented herein for SmVAL14-28 is based on the predicted full length ORF obtained from S. mansoni GeneDB
(version 4).
Protein domain prediction using the SMART database
[27] identified a single SCP/TAPS domain (SMART accession number: SM00198) in all but one SmVAL transcript,
with SmVAL11 containing two. No other SMART predicted protein domains were identified in any of the
SmVAL proteins. The SCP/TAPS domains ranged between
135 and 153 AA in length and typically comprised about
60% of the total amino-acid sequence of an individual
SmVAL. SmVAL6 is an exception, as it contained a large
extension (~295AA) C-terminal to the SCP/TAPS domain.
Prediction of hydrophobic signal peptide sequences using
the SignalP program [28] identified twenty-one SmVALs
with strong evidence for signal peptides (D-score > 0.43),
two SmVALs (5 and 15) encoding possible signal peptides
(D-score > 0.38 but < 0.43) and five SmVALs (6, 11, 13, 16
and 17) showing no evidence of putative signal peptides
(D-score < 0.15) (Table 1 &2).
Comparative sequence and phylogenetic analysis of
SmVALs
Alignment of the amino acid sequences encoded by
SmVAL1-28 revealed significant similarity only over the
putative SCP/TAPS domains (Fig. 1). Here, seven residues
were found to be invariant among the SmVAL family
members (shaded amino acids, Fig. 1). The SMARTderived consensus sequence (indicated on the top of the
multiple sequence alignment, Fig. 1) for SCP/TAPS
domains indicates five of these seven invariant residues
are conserved across phyla (found in 80% or more of
superfamily members) and the other two are moderately
conserved (found in 50–79% or more of superfamily
members). The amino acids (displayed in black boxes)
present at the positions of the four residues proposed in
structural studies to be the SCP/TAPS domain putative
active site (e.g. His72, Glu77, Glu98 and His117 in Lycopersicon esculentum P14a [29]) are shown. These putative
active site residues show low levels of conservation within
the SmVAL family with only SmVAL6, 13, 16 and 17 containing all four residues. Sequence identity over the
SmVAL SCP/TAPS domain averages around 34% identity
and ranges from very similar (SmVAL1 is over 90% identical to SmVAL2) to weakly related (SmVAL6 has less than
20% sequence identity with SmVAL19).

The multiple sequence alignment also indicated that the
SmVAL family could be divided into two groups based on
features contained within the SCP/TAPS domain. The first
feature is the conservation of one deletion (D1, Fig. 1) and
one insertion (I1, Fig. 1) in SmVAL6, SmVAL11,
SmVAL13, SmVAL16 and SmVAL17. The second feature is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/89

the absolute conservation of six cysteine residues (C1-C6,
Fig. 1) in twenty-three SmVAL encoded proteins, which
are absent from SmVAL6, SmVAL11, SmVAL13, SmVAL16
and SmVAL17. Together with signal peptide presence/
absence, these data support the partitioning of SmVALs
into 2 distinct sub-groups (Table 1 &2): group 1, which
harbour a signal peptide, contain conserved cysteine residues and lack the D1 and I1 primary amino acid elements
and group 2 (SmVAL6, SmVAL11, SmVAL13, SmVAL16
and SmVAL17), which lack a signal peptide, lack the 6
conserved cysteine residues but contain the I1 and D1
regions.
Phylogenetic analysis of SCP/TAPS proteins
To investigate the phylogenetic relationship within the
SmVAL family, the predicted 29 complete SCP/TAPS
domains were used to construct a phylogram using Bayesian analysis of a conserved (within all 29 SCP/TAPS
domains) 84 amino acid region (split across six regions)
identified by GBLOCKs [30] (Fig. 2A). The derived phylogram contained two main SmVAL clades (with 100% support) – one harbouring the six SCP/TAPS domains from
the group 2 SmVALs and the other containing the 23 SCP/
TAPS domains from the group 1 SmVALs (Fig. 2A). These
two clades are also well-supported (99% bootstrap value)
in the consensus phylogenetic tree constructed by the
Neighbor-Joining algorithm (see Additional file 1). Phylogenetic analyses of this type have also been performed
for SCP/TAPS domain- containing proteins within Drosophila melanogaster [7] and clearly demonstrate that distinct group 1/2 sub-divisions exist within SCP/TAPS
family members of other species.

The presence of two distinct groups of SCP/TAPS domains
within both S. mansoni and D. melanogaster led us to question whether this relationship was conserved across
diversely related phyla. To study this split further, fourteen representative SCP/TAPS family members from species within Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Arthropoda,
Gastropoda and Chordata were used for extended phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2B). The derived phylogram again
contains two main clades (100% support), with the representative SmVAL group 1 member (SmVAL4) and the representative D. melanogaster group 1 member (DmAGR)
found in one clade whereas the group 2 representatives of
these species are clustered in the other clade (SmVAL6 and
Dm CG4270). An additional larger analysis examining
SCP/TAPS family members from 44 (out of 56 queried)
eukaryotic genomes using different phylogenetic methods
demonstrated the wide-scale presence and independent
segregation of group 1 and group 2 proteins throughout
the metazoan subkingdom (data not shown) and further
supported this observation.

Alignment of the 29 SCP/TAPS domains present in the deduced amino-acid sequences of SmVAL1-28 demonstrates a clear segregation of the family into two distinct groups. Group 1 and group 2 members of the SmVAL superfamily are indicated to the right of the MUSCLE-generated alignment. The row labelled 'consensus' represents the SMART
consensus sequence of the SCP/TAPS domain (SM00198) where conserved amino acids (50–79%) are indicated by lower-case
and highly conserved residues (> 80%) by upper-case letters. The amino acid numbering (indicated at right of alignment) begins
at the first residue of the SCP/TAPS domains. Invariant amino acids are highlighted in grey and the group 1 conserved cysteines
are boxed and labelled C1 to C6. Amino acids found at the positions of the four residues comprising the putative SCP/TAPS
domain active site are coloured in black with white text. The proposed conserved active site contains histidine residues at the
first and fourth positions and glutamic acid residues at the second and third positions. The regions of insertion and deletion
within the group 2 proteins are boxed and labelled I1 (insertion) and D1 (deletion).

Homology modelling of SmVALs
To explore the tertiary structural characteristics within the
SCP/TAPS domain of the SmVAL family, we created
homology models of the sequence verified SmVAL1-13
members using MODELLER [31] (Fig. 3). Two templates,
Necator americanus Na-ASP 2 [PDB:1u53] and L. esculentum p14a [PDB:1cfe] were used to model the group 1
SmVAL SCP/TAPS domains (represented in Fig. 3A by
SmVAL1), and one template, Homo sapiens GAPR-1
[PDB:1smb] was used to model the group 2 SmVAL SCP/
TAPS domain (represented in Fig. 3B by SmVAL13).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/89

Importantly, these derived models suggested that all
SmVAL SCP/TAPS domains will adopt the α-β-α sandwich
conformation common to all superfamily members
across phyla. Secondly, these models demonstrated that
the six conserved cysteine residues within the group 1
SmVALs are capable of forming three disulphide bonds
(yellow residues, C1-C5, C2-C3, C4-C6, Fig. 3A). Thirdly,
these models illustrated that the SmVAL group 2-specific
insertion and deletion domains are both found in the
loop regions between the α-β-α secondary structural elements (white regions, I1 and D1, Fig. 3). Finally, homol-

ogy model surface analysis demonstrated that both
SmVAL1 and SmVAL13 SCP/TAPS domains possess the
large cleft proposed to contain the active site [29] (Fig. 3C
and 3D). Within the cleft, the SmVAL1 model (Fig. 3C)
contains three of the four putative active site residues
(His84, Glu115, His131), with the first glutamic acid of
the active site being substituted by a glutamine (Gln97).
In the SmVAL13 model, all four proposed active site residues (His51, Glu59, Glu84 and His100) are present on
the surface within the cleft (Fig. 3D). In both models,
these four residues are found occupying a similar orientation to orthologous residues identified in previous crystallization studies of SCP/TAPS family members [12,13].
SmVAL gene characteristics
SmVAL1-28 genomic sequences were obtained from the S.
mansoni genome database [24] by comparing the laboratory derived cDNA sequences to the assembled genomic
sequences (version 4). To verify the current assembly,
complete genomic sequences for SmVAL1, SmVAL2,
SmVAL3, SmVAL5 and SmVAL7 and partial genomic
sequences for SmVAL4, SmVAL6 and SmVAL8-13 were
obtained by PCR amplification of S. mansoni genomic
DNA. When compared, these laboratory-derived

sequences confirmed the assembled genomic sequences
for each SmVAL gene from S. mansoni GeneDB. The gene
sizes of SmVAL1-28 ranged from 1182 bp (SmVAL23) to
~60 kbp (SmVAL6) (Table 1 &2). The gene structures of
the SmVAL family members were investigated by aligning
the cDNA sequences with the gene sequences from the
genomic database. With three exceptions, all exon/intron
junctions conformed to the consensus (GT/AG) splice
donor/acceptor sequences for eukaryotes. Exon 10 of
SmVAL6 and exon 3 of SmVAL11 use a 5' GC splice
donor, and in exon 38 of SmVAL6 the splice donor has
been replaced by AC. Given that cDNA sequences of
SmVAL6 and SmVAL11 are found to be spliced at these
locations, these divergent splice sites appear to be functional.
As with the group 1/group 2 split in conserved cysteines,
signal-peptide predictions and phylogenetic tree, the
group 1 SmVALs differed from the group 2 SmVALs in
gene structure (Fig. 4). All group 1 SmVAL genes possess
five exons interrupted by four introns (Fig. 4A). The positioning and phase of each of the four introns in relation
to the coding sequence of the genes was common to all
(Fig. 4A). The group 2 SmVAL genes varied in the number

of exons, but within the coding region for the SCP/TAPS
domain, two intron positions and their phases were conserved throughout all members (Fig. 4B).
Despite the conserved intron/exon structure (within the
group 2 SmVALs) comprising the SCP/TAPS domain of
SmVAL6, the intron/exon structure coding for the C-terminus of SmVAL6 is notable in its complexity. Unlike all
other family members, the large and extended genomic
DNA (gDNA) region 3' of the SCP/TAPS domain is composed of numerous small exons. In total, the gene encoding the SmVAL6 1302 bp transcript is comprised of 38
exons, with 17 smaller than 20 bp (Fig. 5).
SmVAL genomic clusters
Version 4 of the S. mansoni genomic assembly predicted
several SmVAL gene clusters to be spatially linked to distinct chromosomal regions (Fig. 6A). To experimentally
verify the existence of these distinct SmVAL gene clusters,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/89

BAC clones spanning the genome assembly were sought
for independent analysis. One BAC clone, Sm1-41J19,
was subsequently identified and PCR analysis of its DNA
sequence confirmed that the SmVAL2/SmVAL8/SmVAL12
gene cluster was indeed present (Fig. 6B). Subsequent fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) localized Sm141J19 (containing SmVAL2/SmVAL8/SmVAL12) to the
long arm of chromosome 6 and the short arm of chromosome W (Fig. 6C).
Developmental expression of SmVALs
Lifecycle expression profiles of the sequence-verified
SmVAL family members (SmVAL1-13) were obtained by
real-time RT-PCR using cDNA created from the mRNA of
selected S. mansoni life-stages (Fig. 7). Here, distinct examples of normalised SmVAL gene expression throughout
the lifecycle were revealed including those displaying
either developmental or ubiquitous patterns. One developmentally regulated pattern of SmVAL transcription

associated with invasion of the definitive host was found
for genes encoding SmVAL1, SmVAL4 and SmVAL10. Specifically, SmVAL1 expression was minimal in all stages
examined except mother sporocyst and cercaria, with
expression levels estimated to be 15-fold higher in cercaria
compared to mother sporocyst. SmVAL4 and SmVAL10
also displayed peak expression in stages associated with
vertebrate invasion (cercaria and 3 hour schistosomule)
although other life stages show minimal expression.
The real time PCR results also revealed a second pattern of
developmental regulation with SmVAL2, SmVAL3,
SmVAL5 and SmVAL9 showing expression associated
with the invasion of the intermediate host. Specifically,
SmVAL2, SmVAL3, SmVAL5 and SmVAL9 transcription
was restricted to egg, miracidia and sporocyst life stages,
with the miracidial stage showing an expression peak for
all four gene products. A third type of developmentally
regulated transcriptional profile was observed for
SmVAL8 and SmVAL12 mRNAs. Here, both genes were
up-regulated during worm maturation with peak levels of
transcription occurring in the 5-week worm. Finally, transcription of SmVAL6, SmVAL7, SmVAL11 and SmVAL13
appeared to be far less restricted, with measurable levels of
mRNA found in most life stages examined. SmVAL6 and
SmVAL7 were minimally transcribed in the egg, miracidial
and mother sporocyst stages, dramatically up-regulated in
the cercaria and intermediately expressed in all subsequent somule/worm samples. Ubiquitous (but variable)
transcription for SmVAL11 and SmVAL13 are seen in all
parasite samples with expression peaks observed in the
miracidial (SmVAL11) and adult female worm
(SmVAL13) life stages.
Developmentally regulated alternative splicing of SmVAL6
In the process of cloning SmVAL6, and likely due to its
genomic complexity (Fig. 5), many different individual
full-length ORFs were identified. Interestingly, all
sequence variability was limited to the region C-terminal
to the SCP/TAPS domain. We used primers (indicated in
Fig. 5) designed to amplify this specific region, both to
further examine the level of SmVAL6 variation and to
compare the diversity of SmVAL6 products expressed in
different developmental stages. Analysis of restriction
digests from SmVAL6 PCR amplicons throughout the life
cycle showed that the greatest qualitative differences in
RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) patterns existed between cercarial and 7-week adult worms
(data not shown). Therefore, clones derived from cercarial
and adult 7-week mixed-sex cDNA were subsequently isolated and sequenced. Analysis of the randomly-selected
clones, 32 from 7-week adult worm samples and 35 from
cercarial samples, showed that the SmVAL6 transcript is
highly variable in both developmental stages (Fig. 8).
From the 67 clones sequenced, 35 separate isoforms were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/89

observed (Fig. 8A). The variation observed was found to
be due either to the absence/presence of exons or alternative 3' splicing within an exon with none of the single
nucleotide polymorphisms detected shared by more than
one clone. No isoform was predominant; the most abundant isoform accounting for only 7 clones (data not
shown). To represent the different isoforms identified in
this study, each exon found in the SmVAL6 gene was
numbered (according to Fig. 5) and each isoform was
scored for the presence or absence of each exon (Fig. 8A).
Using the χ2 test, statistically significant developmental
regulation of exon expression was found for two exons –
20 (p < 0.001) and 26 (p < 0.001) (Fig. 8B). Interestingly,
these two exons were found specifically associated with
SmVAL6 transcripts expressed by the adult 7-week life
stage and encode very similar amino acid pentamers
(KDDQY & KDEQY, respectively) (Fig 8B).

Discussion
Critical to the development of novel schistosome intervention strategies is the identification of exploitable parasite gene products that functionally participate in
important biological niches such as host invasion, chronic
host/parasite interactions or immunomodulation. With
the availability of genomic information to support the use
of transcriptomic and proteomic tools [32], the discovery
of exploitable schistosome gene products can now proceed at a previously unattainable rate. We have capitalised
on this wealth of information to lead a study culminating
in the molecular description of twenty-eight S. mansoni
SCP/TAPS family members, designated SmVAL1-28.
While the exact function of each SmVAL family member is
currently unknown, the information provided in our
study suggests potential roles in larval penetration, host
immune response modulation and adult worm development.
One of the most striking observations in this study, mirroring a recent Drosophila melanogaster investigation [7],
was the clear segregation of the SmVAL superfamily into
two distinct phylogenetic groups (group1/group 2, Fig.
2A). Importantly, we now show this segregation was not
solely limited to the Arthropoda and Platyhelminthes, as
additional phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the
group 1/group 2 partition to be particularly well conserved and present in other phyla including Nematoda
and Chordata (Fig. 2B). SmVAL amino acid features (e.g.
signal peptides, cysteine residues, I1 and D1 regions;
Table 1, Table 2, Fig. 1 and Fig. 3) also segregated well into
the group 1/group 2 partition and further strengthened
the phylogenetic predictions. Evidence to support that
these group-specific amino acid features may impart distinct SmVAL tertiary structural characteristics originates
from the solved crystal structures of both group 1 [8,9,1113,33] and group 2 [10] members. Although similar α-β-

(spanning exons 4–38) were isolated and sequenced from parasite material: 32 clones were derived from 7-week mixed-sex
adult worm cDNA and 35 clones from mixed-sex cercarial cDNA (see Methods). A) Thirty-five distinct SmVAL6 isoforms were

lines in the exon 35 column indicate that this exon has been detected in previous studies but was not observed in any of the
transcripts in this experiment. B) Presence of exons 20 and 26 is associated with adult cDNA clones. Frequency of exon 20 and

α core SCP/TAPS domains can be formed, the domains
found in the group 1 proteins are stabilised by disulphide
bonds (mediated by the conserved cysteines), whereas the
domains formed in group 2 proteins do not need these
structural features. Disulfide bonds are frequently found
in extracellular proteins, but only rarely in intracellular
proteins. Therefore, the structural differences found in
group 1 and group 2 proteins are in accordance with different localisations/fates for the group 1/group 2 SCP/
TAPS domain containing proteins. This contention is supported by localization studies involving several SCP/TAPS
domain-containing proteins. Golgi-associated PR-1 protein, GAPR-1 (which, like the group 2 SmVALs, lacks a signal peptide and conserved cysteines) demonstrated
intracellular association with golgi membranes [34,35]
whereas Tex31, Allurin and Ac-ASP 2 (which, like the
group 1 SmVALs, contain both signal peptides and conserved cysteines) are detected in extracellular locations
[18,36,37]. Therefore, irrespective of the function(s), one
potential advantage of encoding two distinct SCP/TAPS
domains within the same organism is the ability to have
one protein type specialised for the extracellular environment (with signal peptide for secretion and stabilising
disulphide bonds) and another type specialised for functioning intracellularly. Indeed, diversification of this kind
has recently been reported for the annelid globin gene
family [38].
Comparison of the group 1 (SmVAL1) and group 2
(SmVAL13) SCP/TAPS domain homology models
showed similar overall structures except for subtle differences in two of the loop regions (I1 and D1). Both proteins also contain the large cleft (Fig. 3C and 3D) which is
thought to be the location of the SCP/TAPS domain active
site [29]. Four of the amino acids (two histidines and two
glutamic acids, positions indicated in Fig. 1 as black
boxes) present within the cleft have been proposed to
form an active site of undefined activity due to their location, surface accessibility and evolutionary conservation
[29]. Interestingly, all group 2 SmVAL proteins except
SmVAL11 contain all four residues (Fig. 1) within this surface cleft (e.g. SmVAL13, Fig. 3D) while none of the group
1 SmVAL proteins contain all four residues (Fig. 1) within
this cleft (e.g. SmVAL1, Fig. 3C). This suggests that any
potential activity (mediated by these four residues) across
the family could be variable and therefore, diverse functions within the SmVALs would be substantial.
SmVAL group-specific differences are also observed in the
expression of gene products during the parasite's life cycle
(Fig. 7). The real-time PCR analysis of SmVAL1-13
showed that many group 1 genes displayed developmentally-regulated expression patterns while all examined
group 2 genes demonstrated far less restricted transcription profiles. Group 1 members SmVAL2, SmVAL3,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/89

SmVAL5 and SmVAL9 all share a similar expression pattern with transcription peaking in miracidia, suggesting
roles for these gene products in the free-living stage or in
intermediate host invasion. The minimal presence of
these transcripts in the egg stage may be due to our use of
both immature & mature (miracidia-containing) egg
material. However, recent proteomic studies of S. mansoni
egg secretions have detected all four of these SmVALs, suggesting a potential secondary role in the egg [39]. The role
of SmVAL2, SmVAL3, SmVAL5 and SmVAL9 secretion
from unhatched eggs is currently being addressed as part
of ongoing experiments into the protein secretion and
localisation of SmVALs.
Unlike SmVAL2, SmVAL3, SmVAL5 and SmVAL9, the
developmental expression profiles of group 1 members
SmVAL1, SmVAL4, and SmVAL10 are linked to definitive
host invasion – SmVAL1 to the cercarial stage; SmVAL4
and SmVAL10 to both cercariae and 3-hour schistosomula (Fig. 7). The SmVAL4 and SmVAL10 transcriptional
results are corroborated by proteomic studies showing
that these gene products (as well as SmVAL18) are indeed
present in S. mansoni schistosomule secretions [40] further supporting a role in definitive host invasion. Overall,
the presence of SmVAL2, SmVAL3, SmVAL4, SmVAL5,
SmVAL9, SmVAL10 and SmVAL18 proteins in secreted
samples supports the signal peptide predictions for these
proteins and, on a more general level, suggests that many
or all of the SmVAL group 1 proteins are released from the
schistosome and capable of interacting with their immediate environment.
Release of group 1 SCP/TAPS proteins during parasitism
may not be limited to the trematodes as Ancylostoma caninum (Ac)-ASP 1-6, Haemonchus contortus (Hc)-24 & 40,
Ancylostoma ceylanicum (Ay)-NIF and Ac-HPI are also
secreted during nematode infective processes [41-44].
Given the biological activities of the hookworm proteins
Ay-NIF (neutrophil inhibitory factor) and Ac-HPI (platelet inhibitory protein), it is tempting to speculate that
some secreted group 1 SmVALs may have similar immunomodulatory roles acting, like NIF and HPI, via interactions with integrins. Other potential functions for group 1
SmVALs that may confer selective advantages during parasite invasion may relate to protease activity (Tex31 and
RTVP-1) or protease inhibition (P25TI) [18,45,46]. Studies are ongoing to ascertain SmVAL group 1 specific functions.
While all secreted group 1 SmVALs may indeed participate
in host/parasite interactions, there is also evidence suggesting that SmVAL1, SmVAL4, SmVAL10 and SmVAL18
(released into the definitive host) may be targets of the
adaptive immune response. For example, the hymenopteran venom component Ves v5 is a specific SCP/TAPS

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:89

allergen capable of activating basophils via an IgE
dependent mechanism in sensitised patients [47,48]. Furthermore, human IgE reactivity against the hookworm
ASP-2 protein (component of the vertebrate infective L3
stage excretory/secretory products [21,36]) is positively
associated with light hookworm infections in heavily
exposed endemic populations [49]. This data, as well as
successful vaccine experiments in animal models [49-52],
has led to ASP-2 becoming a major human hookworm
vaccine candidate [53]. Together, these observations suggest that secreted group 1 SmVALs (and possibly group 2
SmVALs [54]) may be specifically recognised by protective, anti-schistosome immune responses [55,56] and
imply that SmVAL1, SmVAL4, SmVAL10 and SmVAL18
proteins are potential S. mansoni vaccine candidates.
Although we report the identification of twenty-eight
SCP/TAPS family members in this study, the complete
number of SmVAL genes will be unknown until the final
genome build is released. Preliminary evidence that one
of the seven incomplete SCP/TAPS genes (smp_120670)
is transcribed (data not shown) does suggest more SmVAL
(with complete SCP/TAPS domains) genes will be identified as the genome assembly progresses. The completion
of the genome will also help in solving questions relating
to SmVAL gene duplication events. During the sequencing
of both cDNA and gDNA, we have identified two different
SmVAL8 transcripts, two different SmVAL7 genomic
sequences and evidence for at least four variations of the
SmVAL3/SmVAL23 family (data not shown). The FISH
localisation of the SmVAL2/SmVAL8/SmVAL12 BAC
clone to more than two chromosomal regions (Fig. 6C)
also seems to provide evidence for duplications events,
although recent reports of non-specific BAC clone hybridization to the short arm of chromosome W have been
reported [57]. Additionally, within the twenty-eight
SmVALs, there are several that display such striking
sequence conservation that a recent gene duplication
event is the most likely explanation. For example, genes
encoding SmVAL26 and SmVAL27 (both transcriptionally
confirmed, Table 2) are 90% identical over encoded
amino acid sequences (182AAs) and 93% identical over
complete genomic sequences. This high level of identity
over both exons and introns, suggests such genes have
been through recent gene duplication events and supports
the contention that the SmVAL family was expanded from
two ancestral genes containing group-specific intron/exon
structures (Fig. 4).
In the absence of biological functions for the SmVAL family, it is currently unknown why gene duplications have
persisted. However, arguments can be made for all three
of the main evolutionary conditions for copy retention –
beneficial increased production, subfunctionalisation or
neofunctionalisation [58]. The extra amount of an SmVAL

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/89

gene product gained by two gene copies could be advantageous despite functional redundancy between the two
proteins. This has been suggested for gene copies of S.
mansoni cercarial elastases, which all appear to encode
proteins of the same substrate specificity [59]. Subfunctionalisation describes a scenario where a protein
encoded by the ancestral gene either has two biological
functions or is expressed in two separate locations (physically or temporally). After the duplication event, each
copy can then specialise in a unique function or in a distinct location. Neofunctionalisation describes a situation
where one gene retains the original function while the
other evolves a new function. Both subfunctionalisation
and neofunctionalisation could explain at least one
SmVAL gene duplication event, that of the ancestral
SmVAL1/SmVAL2 gene. SmVAL1 and SmVAL2 are very
similar genes (85% genomic identity) but have radically
different expression profiles (Fig. 7) with SmVAL1 associated with vertebrate invasion and SmVAL2 associated
with invertebrate invasion. One hypothesis is that the
ancestral SmVAL1/SmVAL2 gene was expressed both in
the cercaria and the miracidia, and carried out the same
function during both invasive processes. After the duplication event SmVAL1 expression became restricted to cercaria and SmVAL2 became specialised for the miracidial
function. Alternatively, the SmVAL1/SmVAL2 ancestral
gene may have been expressed in only one invasive stage
and gene duplication led to one gene gaining a new function (though it could possess a very similar biological
activity) in the other invasive stage. Further work will be
needed to dissect the exact mechanism responsible for
SmVAL genomic expansion.
Previous results utilizing DNA microarrays demonstrated
SmVAL6 and SmVAL7 to be male-associated in the adult
worm [6]. The quantitative PCR assays reported here confirmed this finding with transcript levels 36-fold
(SmVAL6) and 3-fold higher (SmVAL7) in adult males
compared to adult females. Quantitative PCR also showed
an adult female-biased expression for SmVAL13 mRNA
(7-fold over adult male worms). Interestingly, several
SCP/TAPS proteins in other species are also gender-associated. These include the mammalian CRISP-1 and CRISP2 proteins, which are localised to the developing sperm
and the Xenopus Allurin protein, which is associated with
the egg [37,60]. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription
PCR of the Drosophila SCP/TAPS family members also
showed that the majority of the transcripts to be genderassociated with 18/26 showing male-associated expression and only one exhibiting female-associated expression [7]. Future experiments identifying SmVAL protein
localisation within the adult worms will elucidate
whether the connections between SCP/TAPS proteins
with reproductive organs exist in the schistosome or the

Page 15 of 20

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:89

gender-associated transcription is due to other developmental differences.
A final observation of this study was the high level of
developmentally-regulated alternative splicing found
within the region encoding the long C-terminus of the
group 2 member SmVAL6 (Fig. 8). The complex gene
structure encoding the SmVAL6 C-terminus (Fig. 5) allows
for alternative splicing of many small exons each in the
same phase, avoiding frameshifts. Though the relevance
of both the long C-terminus and the diversity observed
within it is unknown, the developmental regulation of
exon 20 and 26 suggests that the amino acid composition
within the C-terminal region may be important for
SmVAL6 function. Developmentally regulated alternative
splicing occurs for a few other S. mansoni genes such as
CA150 and SmHSF [61,62], although these examples
result in the introduction of premature stops changing
any resulting protein radically, unlike the small changes
of exon 20 and 26 within SmVAL6. One potential biological difference between cercarial and adult worm SmVAL6
transcripts is in phosphorylation. Exon 20 and 26 (statistically differentially expressed in the adult, Fig. 7) encode
highly similar amino acid pentamers (KDDQY and
KDEQY respectively) that are predicted to be phosphorylated at the tyrosine residue (data not shown). If these
are functional phosphorylation sites, many SmVAL6-associated biological processes (protein-protein interactions,
protein location within the cell, increased protein degradation and signalling) could be differentially affected in
the cercarial versus the adult life stage. Interestingly, group
2 GAPR-1 can be differentially phosphorylated and this
phenomenon has been associated with different cellular
locations [63]. Further work to ascertain the relevance of
SmVAL6 developmentally-regulated splicing, as it applies
to function, is ongoing.

Conclusion
In this study, we identified twenty-eight S. mansoni genes
encoding proteins containing SCP/TAPS domains, named
SmVAL1-28. Examination of protein features and gene
structures has revealed two distinct groups within the
SmVAL gene family and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated both group 1 and group 2 type SCP/TAPS proteins
to be present across the metazoan sub-kingdom. We also
obtained developmental expression profiles of SmVAL113, which suggested that several of the proteins are
involved in host invasion. Furthermore, we have discovered developmentally regulated alternative splicing
within the 3' region of SmVAL6. Further work is aimed at
functionally characterising this interesting schistosome
protein family in terms of host/parasite and parasite/parasite interactions.

Methods
Parasite Materials
A Puerto Rican isolate of Schistosoma mansoni is maintained by passage through Biomphalaria glabrata snails and
Tuck Ordinary (T.O.) mice (Harlan). The fifteen lifestages
(mixed sex unless stated) providing RNA for Real-time
quantitative developmental expression analysis were: Egg;
Miracidia; Mother sporocyst; Cercariae; 3-hour schistosomule; 18-hour schistosomule; 3-day schistosomule; 6day schistosomule; 3-week worm; 4-week worm; 5-week
worm; 6-week worm; 7-week worm; 7-week male, and 7week female.

Eggs were recovered from mouse livers infected 7 weeks
prior with cercariae as previously described [64]. To isolate miracidia, the eggs were then hatched in non-chlorinated
water
and
miracidia
were
separated
phototrophically. Mother sporocyst RNA was provided by
Dr. Tim Yoshino, of the University of Wisconsin [65]. Cercariae were shed from snails phototrophically, with schistosomula prepared by mechanical transformation of
cercariae as previously described [66]. Schistosomula
were cultured at 37°C in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's
medium (DMEM) (Sigma, UK) supplemented with 10%
FCS and 100 ng/ml penicillin-streptomycin for the time
periods indicated in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 [66]. Adult
worm lifestages (3 wk-7 wk) were obtained by perfusion
at the stated week from percutaneously infected T.O. mice
after challenge with 250 cercariae. After perfusion, worms
were counted and, in the case of 7 wk adults, separated on
the basis of gender.
Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was isolated using a modified TRIZOL (Invitrogen)/RNeasy (Qiagen) procedure [67] and subsequently
treated with DNase I (Ambion Inc.) to remove contaminating genomic DNA. RNA quality from each sample was
assessed by formaldehyde denaturing gel electrophoresis
and quantity determined by spectrophotometry at 260
nm.

Total RNA from the fifteen lifecycle stages were used as
templates to synthesise cDNA by reverse transcription as
described previously [68]. The efficiency and quality of
the cDNA obtained was tested using an alpha-tubulin
(SmAT1) specific primer-pair [69] to amplify SmAT1
cDNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
cDNA and gene sequence determination
Using S. mansoni Gene DB [24], the complete open reading frames (ORFs) of 28 SmVAL genes were predicted
(SmVAL1-28). The sequences of SmVAL1-13 ORFs were
confirmed by PCR amplification from parasite cDNA
using proof-reading enzymes (HiFi Platinium Taq (Invitrogen) or Phusion (GRI)), cloned into pCR4-TOPO vector

Page 16 of 20

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:89

(Invitrogen) and sequenced. In addition, Rapid Amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR was performed for
selected SmVALs using RNA from parasite lifestages processed into cDNA according to the manufacturer's protocol
(GeneRacer kit, Invitrogen). The ORF sequences for
SmVAL1-13 have been submitted to Genbank, accession
numbers are shown in Table 1. Additional S. mansoni
Gene DB interrogation using the Pfam [26] HMM model
for SCP/TAPS domain (PF00188) resulted in the discovery of a further 15 genes (SmVAL14-28) predicted to
encode full SCP/TAPS domains and 7 predicted to encode
incomplete SCP/TAPS domains (Table 2). PCR amplification from parasite cDNA and sequencing of the resulting
fragments confirmed transcription for 11 of the 15 gene
products containing full SCP/TAPS domains.
The genomic sequences of all SmVAL genes (start to stop
codons, including nucleotide discrepancies 'N', where
each 'N' was treated as an individual nucleotide) were
derived from analysis of S. mansoni Gene DB version 4
with regions of genomic sequences for SmVAL 1-13 confirmed by PCR amplification. The genomic DNA used for
PCR amplification of SmVAL1-13 was purified from S.
mansoni adult worm and cercarial material according to
the protocol provided with the DNeasy Tissue kit (Qiagen). Sequencing of the SmVAL cDNAs or gene fragments
was performed at the Department of Genetics, University
of Cambridge in both orientations using Big Dye v3.1 fluorescent chemistry and an Applied Biosystems 3100
Genetic Analyser.
Bioinformatic Analysis
Domain prediction was performed by the SMART
sequence analysis software [27] and was used, with manual alignment comparison, to define the limits of the SCP/
TAPS domain for each sequence.

The prediction of signal peptides was performed using the
software SignalP 3.0 [28] and presence/absence of signal
peptides was defined by the default Neural Network Dscore threshold of 0.43.
Alignment and Phylogenetic trees
Alignment of the twenty-nine SCP/TAPS domains from
the 28 SmVALs was created using MUSCLE software [70].
For comparison of sequence conservation within S. mansoni to a wide range of SCP/TAPS domain containing proteins, a consensus sequence was generated using the
family alignment for the SCP/TAPS domain (SM00198)
found in the SMART database [27].

For the phylogenetic analysis of the SmVAL family and
other metazoan SCP/TAPS family members, SCP/TAPS
domain regions were aligned using MUSCLE software and
interrogated to determine regions of conservation using

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/89

GBLOCKs 0.91b software [30]. For the SmVAL phylogenetic analysis six such regions covering a total of 84 amino
acids were chosen, whereas the metazoan analysis used
four regions containing a total of 54 amino acids. The
phylogenetic analyses were performed as described previously [69] using MrBayes (version 3.1.2 [71]) software
and the WAG protein substitution model [72]. The consensus phylograms were visualised using the TreeView
1.6.6 program [73]. Utilizing the same alignment and
conserved regions, phylogenetic trees were also constructed using the Neighbor-Joining method and the Poisson correction model, accompanied by bootstrap analysis
(1000 replications). The trees were produced by MEGA
v4.0 [74].
Homology modelling
The Na-ASP 2 (pdb: 1u53[13]) and p14a (pdb: 1cfe[8])
structures were used as templates to build models for
group 1 SmVAL proteins. The GAPR-1 structure (pdb:
1smb,[10]) was used as the template for the creation of
group 2 SmVAL protein models. An alignment of the protein sequences was initially generated by MUSCLE software and refined manually. Models were created using
MODELLER software [31] and the validity of the models
chosen were tested using WHATCHECK and PROSAII
[75,76]. Models were visualized using MacPyMOL
(DeLano Scientific LLC).
FISH
S. mansoni Gene DB version 1 was used to identify BAC
clones (obtained from the Sm1 library [77]) containing
SmVAL gene clusters. The presence of SmVAL2, SmVAL8
and SmVAL12 on Sm1-41J19 was confirmed by PCR
amplification, agarose gel electrophoresis and automated
DNA sequencing. Fluorescence in-situ hybridisation
(FISH) was used to identify the chromosomal localisation
of BAC clone Sm1-41J19, using a biotinylated probe
made from the BAC clone. The probe was hybridised to S.
mansoni chromosomes using established procedures [78].
Real-time RT-PCR analysis
The transcript abundance of each sequence-verified
SmVAL (SmVAL1-13) mRNA was quantified relative to
SmAT1 (alpha tubulin) in fifteen stages of the S. mansoni
lifecycle using real-time RT-PCR analysis. The cDNA from
15 different life stages was assayed by real-time PCR in
duplicate reactions using gene-specific primers. To confirm the absence of non-specific amplification in PCR
reactions, control reactions lacking template were run in
duplicate for each primer set. Reactions were performed
on a MiniOpticon real-time PCR thermal cycler system
(Bio-Rad) using iQ SYBR Green Master Mix (Bio-Rad)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amplification efficiency (E) of each primer set was determined
during assay development by plotting the cycle thresholds

Page 17 of 20

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:89

(Ct) from serial dilutions of a suitable cDNA sample and
inputting the resulting slope in the equation, E = 10(-1/
slope). For each real-time PCR reaction the following equation was used to calculate a normalised SmVAL expression
ratio:
ratio = (ESmAt1)CtSmAT1/(ESmVALx)CtSmVALx
where ESmAt1 is the amplification efficiency of the reference gene (alpha tubulin), ESmVALx is the amplification
efficiency of the target gene (SmVAL), CtSmVALx is the
cycle threshold of the target gene and CtSmAT1 is the
cycle threshold of the reference gene from the same cDNA
sample [79].
SmVAL6 splicing study
A primer pair (VAL6 var F/VAL6 var R) designed to
amplify the region containing all identified variability discovered in previous RACE and ORF sequencing of
SmVAL6 transcripts was used to examine SmVAL6
sequence variation (see Fig. 5 for primer locations). PCR
reactions using this primer pair with either cercarial or 7
wk mixed sex worm cDNA were carried out using Platinum High Fidelity Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR
products were ligated into the pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen).
Thirty-two 7-week adult clones and thirty-five cercarial
clones were picked at random and fully sequenced. The
sequences were then aligned to ascertain the exon usage of
each clone. Student's χ2 test was used to determine any
significant associations between exon usage and developmental life stage.
