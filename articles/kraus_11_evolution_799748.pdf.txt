Abstract
Background: Main waterfowl migration systems are well understood through ringing activities. However, in
mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) ringing studies suggest deviations from general migratory trends and traditions in
waterfowl. Furthermore, surprisingly little is known about the population genetic structure of mallards, and
studying it may yield insight into the spread of diseases such as Avian Influenza, and in management and
conservation of wetlands. The study of evolution of genetic diversity and subsequent partitioning thereof during
the last glaciation adds to ongoing discussions on the general evolution of waterfowl populations and flyway
evolution. Hypothesised mallard flyways are tested explicitly by analysing mitochondrial mallard DNA from the
whole northern hemisphere.
Results: Phylogenetic analyses confirm two mitochondrial mallard clades. Genetic differentiation within Eurasia and
North-America is low, on a continental scale, but large differences occur between these two land masses (FST =
0.51). Half the genetic variance lies within sampling locations, and a negligible portion between currently
recognised waterfowl flyways, within Eurasia and North-America. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) at
continent scale, incorporating sampling localities as smallest units, also shows the absence of population structure
on the flyway level. Finally, demographic modelling by coalescence simulation proposes a split between Eurasia
and North-America 43,000 to 74,000 years ago and strong population growth (~100fold) since then and little
migration (not statistically different from zero).
Conclusions: Based on this first complete assessment of the mallard’s world-wide population genetic structure we
confirm that no more than two mtDNA clades exist. Clade A is characteristic for Eurasia, and clade B for NorthAmerica although some representatives of clade A are also found in North-America. We explain this pattern by
evaluating competing hypotheses and conclude that a complex mix of historical, recent and anthropogenic factors
shaped the current mallard populations. We refute population classification based on flyways proposed by
ornithologists and managers, because they seem to have little biological meaning. Our results have implications for
wetland management and conservation, with special regard to the release of farmed mallards for hunting, as well
as for the possible transmission of Avian Influenza by mallards due to migration.

Background
The large-scale migration systems of temperate waterfowl (Anseriformes:Anatidae) have been extensively studied using ringing, telemetry, morphometrics, radar
tracking and isotope analysis [1]. In general, migration

routes are clearly defined [2]. Most have north-south
bearings, with populations travelling between northerly
breeding areas and more southerly non-breeding areas.
Many species follow similar routes and decades of studies on bird migration have led to the delineation of
major waterfowl ‘flyways’ [2-4]. Especially in NorthAmerica, flyways are managerial units created by agreements between adjoining states and provinces, and thus
are bounded by management requirements. The

boundaries of true migratory pathways (in a population
ecological sense) are much fuzzier. Populations and individuals within species may occupy different flyways, and
many migrants are flexible in migration routing [5], even
though these migration routes have been in place for
relatively long periods of time [6,7]. Especially in ducks,
‘irregularities’ in migration routes have been described,
such as individuals switching migratory trajectories,
termed ‘abmigration’ [8] or ‘flyway permeability’ [9].
The mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is the most numerous
Holarctic waterfowl species and distributed widely over
the whole Northern Hemisphere. Northerly breeding birds
are mostly migratory, wintering much further south, while
birds breeding in temperate regions, especially in parts of
Western Europe, can be resident [2]. Migratory mallard
populations often do not exhibit clearly defined routes,
even when breeding and non-breeding destinations are
thousands of kilometres distant [10]. Mallards play a significant role in the management and conservation of wetland habitats [11], are a very common bird in recreational
wetland parks as well as the major game species in wetland systems. Hunting of mallards is facilitated in many
countries by supplementary restocking wild populations
with farmed mallards [12], possibly with large-scale consequences for the population genetic structure, genetic
integrity and fitness of the wild populations [13].
Due to its wide range and large population sizes, the
mallard is considered the primary natural reservoir of
avian influenza (AI) [14]. It has been identified (along with
the black-headed gull Larus ridibundus) as the species
posing the highest risk to transmit AI to farm-birds [15].
Mallards may (among other bird species) contribute to the
spread of AI from Eurasia (Old World; OW) into NorthAmerica (New World; NW). Some studies propose transhemispheric movements of dabbling ducks between these
land masses [16] and that these facilitate AI transmission
[17,18] (but see [19,20]). The mallard is thus a prime candidate for spreading AI in the wild [21], and perhaps to
humans, and it is important to learn more about its ecology, movements and dispersion [22,23]. Analyses of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) show just two genetic clades:
clade A, mainly found in Asia, and clade B, found in
North-America [10,24], indicating widespread mixing
within but not between the Old and New World. However, to date no genetic studies have been carried out for
the complete native range of mallard, as data from Europe
and eastern North America were missing. A range-wide
survey of genetic diversity and connectivity between proposed mallard flyways could thus be useful to finally generalise findings of small-scale population genetic and
phylogeographic studies. Such a study would also add substance to an increasing body of literature on migration systems, flyways concepts, and genetic population structure
in other waterfowl.

In this study, we attempt to close existing gaps in the
knowledge of the genetic structure of female mallards by
providing large numbers of mtDNA sequences from previously unsampled regions throughout the whole native
distribution of the mallard. Due to the mallard’s high
mobility and examples of flyway permeability in closely
related duck species, we hypothesise weak barriers to dispersal between Asia and Europe. Thus, in Europe we
expect to find clade A haplotypes, as in Asia, and Europe
and Asia to form a joint Eurasian ‘Old World’ metapopulation, with possibly extensive east-west gene flow.
Additionally, we present many more samples from central and eastern Canada, which lacked in the most recent
analysis [10], to complete an mtDNA sequence data set
comprising samples from the whole Holarctic. A combination of population genetic analyses and coalescent
simulations in an isolation-with-migration framework
[25,26] enables us in this to measure genetic diversity
and geographic partitioning thereof, as well as population
histories and migration rates between Old World and
New World mallards, and to test the currently hypothesised flyways of mallards (see Table 1 and [2-4]).

Results
MtDNA control region sequencing

Our data set is comprised of mtDNA sequences from
346 mallard ducks around the world consisting of 195
newly sampled mallards and 151 sequences from previous studies [10,27] (for details on the sequences and
localities see Table 1 and methods section). 155 different
haplotypes were found in this data set, of which 101
were already contained in the data set of Kulikova et al.
[10,27], and 54 were novel. Of the 622 aligned nucleotide positions 93 (15%) were variable, 73 (11%) sites
were parsimony informative and four sites showed gaps.
Additional file 1 lists the haplotype names with corresponding sample IDs. Of the 155 haplotypes, 108 haplotypes were only represented by a single individual, 44
haplotypes by 2-7 individuals, one haplotype by 16 individuals (Hap 56), one haplotype by 20 individuals (Hap
57), and the most frequent haplotype (Hap A7) was
represented by 71 individuals (see Additional file 1 for
details). This A7 haplotype is found in both Old and
New World, in almost all localities. All new sequences
obtained in this study are deposited in GenBank [28]
with accession numbers JN029963-JN030157. In Table 1
we further list nucleotide diversity (π) and haplotype
diversity (dH). Nucleotide diversity is similar in all Old
World flyways (π between 0.003 and 0.005, and 0.008 in
Eastern Asia) but consistently higher in the New World
(π > 0.013). Samples from the Aleutians have intermediate nucleotide diversity somewhere between Old and
New World (π = 0.009). The Greenland samples are
very low in both nucleotide diversity (π = 0.0004) and

NulceotieNucleotide diversity (π) and haplotype diversity (dH) were calculated per flyway. Sampling locations within each flyway are coded by the two letter
country abbreviation (e.g., GB - Great Britain; NL - Netherlands, etc.) and a two letter locality abbreviation (GBAB - Great Britain, Aberdeen; NLFR - Netherlands,
Friesland). Details on coding are given in Additional file 2. Samples sizes per locality within flyways (n) are reported, as well as digital GPS coordinates (latitude,
lat. and longitude, long.; negative longitudes indicate westward direction).

haplotype diversity (dH = 0.2), whereas haplotype diversity is high (dH > 0.8) in all other flyways except in the
North-West Europe flyway (dH = 0.7).
Testing neutrality based on the frequency spectrum of
the haplotypes with Fu’s FS [29] revealed negative test
statistics for both measures when samples were partitioned into Eurasia (FS = -25.52, p < 0.001) vs. NorthAmerica (FS = -24.63, p < 0.001) Splitting Eurasia into

Europe (FS = -26.41, p < 0.001) and Asia (FS = -25.38, p
< 0.001) leads to statistics significantly smaller than zero
for both continents.
Two distinct mallard clades

An unrooted haplotype network (Figure 1) shows the
presence of two distinct clades. These clades correspond
well to a classification of sampling locations into Old

World (clade B haplotypes, mainly North-America).
Within these clades, a great variety of haplotypes was
sampled with relatively few missing intermediate ones,
represented by small black dots in Figure 1. Clade A
and clade B are separated by about ten substitutions.
Phylogenetic inference by building a Neighbour-Joining
[30] tree supported the split between clade A and clade
B haplotypes with 97% of the bootstrap replicates (Figure 2).
Low genetic differentiation within Eurasia and NorthAmerica, but large differences between them

Genetic differentiation between Eurasia and NorthAmerica (Aleutians and Greenland excluded, see methods section) and between all individual flyways (flyways
definitions are in Table 1) was assessed by Wright’s Fstatistics [31]. The F ST value between the two land
masses was 0.51. Pairwise FST values on the flyway-level
are given in Table 2. Not all flyways were significantly
differentiated from each other. In case of the Eastern
Europe flyway sample size was too low (n = 3) to make
any meaningful statement about the amount of

differentiation. None of the intra-North-American flyways was significantly differentiated from the others on
that continent. The same was found between the two
Asian flyways. In Europe, however, with the exception
of the Eastern European flyway which suffered from low
sample size, we observed significant structure, albeit low
in magnitude (North-West vs. Central Europe: F ST =
0.08). Notably, the Aleutian sample was most differentiated from the North-American Pacific and Central flyways but to a lesser extent from the Eurasian ones (in
some cases not even significantly; Table 2). Finally, the
Greenland sampling location displayed relatively high
and significant differentiation with each of the other
flyways.
An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed
little genetic variation within the various Eurasian or
North-American flyways compared to the amount of
variation between these two land masses. 50.2% of the
genetic variation lies between North-America and Eurasia, and 46.6% within the sampled localities. Only 3.2%
of the genetic variation was partitioned between flyways
within the continents (Table 3). Performing an AMOVA
in which localities are not pooled into flyways does not

lead to qualitative differences of this outcome (Table 3;
values in brackets).
When we assigned localities to flyways within continents, per-continent AMOVA showed that genetic variation was to a large extent partitioned within localities:
85% in North-America, 76.8% in Europe, 98.7% in Asia
and if combined into one land mass: 87.7% in Eurasia.
In none of these analyses there was a significant amount
of genetic variation between flyways (p > 0.2). In Europe, there was a significant (p < 0.001) genetic variance
component of 22.9% between the localities within the
flyways, in the other continents this was not statistically
significant.

1.8 × 10-6, see Figure 3). Table 4 summarises the results
in demographic units. Although 95% highest posterior
densities (HPD95) for population sizes of OW and NW
samples overlapped IMa2 calculated that there was a
66% probability that the effective population size of the
NW mallards (1.3 - 4.2 million) is larger than the OW
population (1.5 - 2.9 million). Further, even though the
HPD95 ranges of the migration rates peaked almost at
zero, there was a 76% probability that the migration rate
from OW into NW is higher than the other way around
in the few cases in which it may occur.

Discussion

Demographic history and gene flow

Conclusive assertion: There are two distinct mallard
clades

The runs of the coalescent simulation program IMa2
converged quickly in an optimal parameter space. Effective sample sizes for all parameters exceeded 300,000
and each newly sampled genealogy was independent
from the previous one (autocorrelations in all parameters were 0.05 and less). Pairwise correlations of
parameters were between -0.1 and +0.1, except between
q0 and q1 (the estimates of population size for Old
World (OW) and New World (NW)) where it was -0.19.
All parameter estimates had relatively sharp unimodal
posterior density distributions (Figure 3), except the
migration rates which were poorly estimated, with wide
ranges covering three orders of magnitude (mOW®NW
and mOW®NW: 5.1 × 10-9 - 4.7 × 10-6 and 5.1 × 10-9 -

Since Avise et al. first studied genetic structure in mallards in 1990 [24] it is hypothesised that no more than
two mitochondrially distinct clades exist among them.
Our phylogenetic analyses confirm this hypothesis for
mallard samples collected and analysed from the
numerically largest and geographically most complete
set of mallard mtDNA sequences to date. In addition to
previously analysed North-American and Asian samples
[10], we added substantial numbers of European and
Central and Eastern North-American mallard samples
and thus completed a data set spanning the whole
Northern Hemisphere. Through large-scale sampling of
mallards from all over their distribution range we can
now conclusively state that no more than two main

clades exist in mallard, also not in the previously
unsampled European populations.
Gene pool differentiation and diversity

Mallards are highly mobile and some studies suggest
that natal philopatry (i.e., philopatry in the sense of
[32]), which in waterfowl is usually strongest in
females, is less pronounced - even in female mallards than it is in related species [2,9,33] (but see [34-36]).
We found strong support for the hypothesis of ‘flyway
permeability’ [8,9] in mallards. The analyses of F ST

between intra-continental flyways strongly promote the
conclusion of female inter-flyway mixing. Neither
within North-America nor in Asia did we detect differentiation between the subcontinental flyways. We note
that for some comparisons the sample size was on the
low side. However, if this was causal to not finding significant differentiation between flyways within a continent, we would also not have found significant
differentiation between those flyways with lower sample sizes with flyways on different continents. Hence,
we believe our finding of a lack of differentiation is

For calculation of demographic units a generation time of one year was used. The mutation rate per locus per year was set to 2.9856 × 10-5. See main text for
further explanations. The demographic units are: population size (θ in effective individuals, splitting time (t) in years, migration rates (Nm) in effective individuals
per year. Estimates of the peak of the posterior parameter distributions (mode) are presented along with low and high bounds of the 95% highest posterior
densities (HPD95L/H).

valid. Yet, there is population structure in Europe
based on FST analysis (see below).
Confirmative evidence for the pattern of genetic population structuring found above stems from our analysis
of molecular variance (AMOVA). Almost no genetic
variation in our world-wide data set is explained
between flyways within continents. On this global scale,
about half the variation lies between North-America and
Eurasia, and the other half within the flyways. When
analysing genetic variance per continent, in NorthAmerica and Asia the largest proportion of variance
resides on the level of sampling localities but not within
or between flyways. However, notably, in Europe there
is an unexpected significant variance component
between localities within flyways, pointing at more
genetic structure than in the other continents. In general, these findings confirm the absence of strong female
philopatry in mallards. The population structure is not
shaped by female mallards returning to the place where
they were born, and hence lifetime dispersal seems high.
In that sense, currently recognised waterfowl flyways do
not depict well the movements and dispersal of mallards
- a pattern similar to other duck species [33,37,38] although it cannot be generalized for all ducks [39,40].
However, our findings show that indeed the European
mallard population seems to be more structured than
their conspecifics in other parts of the world. Geographic, micro-climatic and urbanisation structuring in
Europe may be different in Europe when compared to
Asia and North-America, shaping mallard population
structures in different ways. Future studies employing
genetic markers, probably at an even denser sampling
scheme, may be able to quantify such effects by making
use of GIS and remote sensing technology. A further
possibility to explain European mallard population
structure may be extensive release of farmed mallards
for hunting purposes in many countries in Europe.
These originally wild mallards are bred in captivity for
many generations, and even though looking quite similar to their wild relatives they can differ subtly in

morphology [12]. Such differences have been proven to
leak into wild populations by interbreeding with escaped
farmed mallards [41]. Obviously, this introgression of
genetic material of farmed animals has consequences for
the genetic identity of wild populations, especially when
translocation and release at distant localities takes place
[42]. Genetic introgression has been demonstrated for
mallards in Italy already [43]. Such manipulation of
local population structure may well explain our finding
of increased genetic structure in Europe.
Demographic history

Mallards from the Old World are different from those
in the New World, which is attributable to the differences in the distribution of clade A (Eurasia) and clade
B (North-America) haplotypes. In Europe and the largest part of Asia we only found clade A haplotypes with
the exception of a handful clade B haplotypes in the far
east of Asia (Figures 1, 2). Nevertheless, in a phylogenetic assessment in the original study in which these
sequences were determined, they were shown to be
characteristic for introgressed eastern spot-billed ducks
and likely do not indicate original North-American mallard clade B individuals [10,27] (removing these three
curious sequences from the demographic modelling analysis did not alter the results, though; data not shown).
On the other hand, in North-America, where clade B
dominates, also clade A haplotypes are relatively common, which is reflected in higher nucleotide and haplotype diversities. This suggests two factors shaping the
current genetic structure in mallards. From the deep
split into clade A and B haplotypes we infer that Old
World and New World have become separate with no
or little gene flow since then. Further, if genetic
exchange occurs - as indicated by clade A haplotypes
occurring both in Old and New World - it seems directional with larger rates from Old World into New
World. However, this directionality is not statistically
robust because in the IM analysis migration rates were
only estimated poorly. The split between mallards from

Kraus et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:99
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/99

Old World and New World was estimated to have
occurred between 43,000 and 74,000 years ago. This
dating coincides with the drop in sea level during the
last glacial period about 110,000 - 10,000 years ago.
During this time the Beringia land bridge fell dry and
extensive exchange of floras and faunas became possible.
When the glaciers melted again, this Beringia land
bridge connection got cut off and Eurasian and NorthAmerican faunas and floras became separated more
strictly. But also during the glacial maximum the continental ice sheet developed in North-America separated
northern from southern regions of this continent [44].
The estimated population size at that time (θ ancestral )
was about 30 times smaller than it is today (the sum of
θ OW and θ NW ). Such high growth rates in waterfowl
populations since the last glaciation has already been
demonstrated in several other studies, often proven to
be exponential [10,16,33,45] and connected to population size bottlenecks. This could explain the excess of
rare haplotypes as demonstrated especially by negative
Fu’s FS in Eurasia, but also in North-America. The present-day situation is a deep split into an Old World and
New World population, with migration rate estimates
statistically not significantly different from zero, indicating that the rise of sea levels after the last glacial maximum results in a potent barrier to female gene flow
between OW and NW. Numerically, the peak of the
density distribution of migration rates suggests 0.04 0.05 effective migrants per year in each direction. However, the posterior density plots of the migration rates
(Figure 3) are not bell-shaped as they should be. This
indicates that IMa2 did not find enough information in
the data to reliably estimate migration rates. If prior
ranges are too wide, software like IMa2 may estimate
parameters to be zero, but in our analysis the range of
the prior distribution (0 - 0.34) was not much wider
than the range of the estimated posterior distribution
(HPD95) for migration of Old World mallards to the
New World (0 - 0.16) (Table 4). Re-running the IMa2
analysis with a narrower prior (0 - 0.2) did not resolve
the issue (data not shown). We believe this is due to a
combination of very large extant population sizes as a
result of strong population growth and divergence.
Based on HPD95 migration rates could be as low as
zero, or as high as 23 (NW®OW) or 80 (OW®NW)
effective individuals. The failure of IMa2 to quantify
migration rates may be related to this issue. Irrespective
of this, the sharing of identical haplotypes indicates the
possibility that migrants do travel between the land
masses and establish genetic traces in the receiving
population. The nucleotide diversity of the Aleutian
samples, being intermediate between that of Eurasia and
North-America, is a good indicator for this. Even
though migration rates as such were poorly estimated

Page 9 of 15

with our data, the shapes of the migration rate curves
and the implemented probability test in IMa2 point at
directionality of migration from Old World into New
World.
Genetic exchange between Old World and New World

Based on the sharing of haplotypes between Old and
New World mallards and the results of the demographic
modelling, we propose that some genetic exchange of
mtDNA between the two land masses possibly occurs.
IMa2’s estimated migration rates, being not statistically
different from zero, may be biased downwards due to a
lack of statistical power for the migration rate parameters, or model violation of migration/drift equilibrium, but indicate directionality. Genetic differentiation
between Old and New World was high (F ST = 0.51)
indicating limited gene flow at most. We propose that
the route of this migration is mainly, if not completely,
via the Aleutian Islands. On these islands individuals
with clade A and B haplotypes intermix and form a haplotype cline [10], and genetic diversity (π) is intermediate between Eurasia and North-America. F ST values
between the Aleutians and the flyways indicate a closer
relationship between the Aleutians and Old World
populations than with the New World. This may be
explained by the Westerly winds (more regularly blowing from the west into the east), governing the Ferrel
cell of the global climatic circulation system. The Aleutian Islands are all well within the Ferrel cell that
reaches up to higher than 60° north [46,47], and characteristic winds are especially strong during the time in
which mallards migrate [48]. A note of caution is warranted here, because smaller scale terrestrial weather
conditions can be more important than the large atmospheric systems. Even if weak when compared to the
strength of flight abilities this effect can have a profound
impact on the regular “drifting off” of migrating birds in
general [48] and waterfowl specifically [49].
The alternative route, from Europe via the Atlantic
Ocean, along Iceland and Greenland, could be deemed
less likely on basis of this “drifting by wind” proposition.
Mallards travelling to North-America by the Atlantic
route would face headwinds more regularly [48]. However, the mallards sampled from Greenland all bear
clade A haplotypes implying a Eurasian origin. Additionally, genetic differentiation between mallards from the
Atlantic part of Canada and European mallards is only
half of what we measured between central or western
Canada and Europe. Once arrived in Greenland it would
not be hard to imagine crossing the last few hundred
kilometres to Canada. Unfortunately, we were not able
to analyse more samples from Greenland, especially
from different localities. Interpretations based on the
current Greenland data can only be tentative. Just two

Kraus et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:99
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/99

different haplotypes were found there and the sampling
location was a pond near the city of Nuuk, likely inhabited by closely related mallard families. Little is known
about the origin and movements of Greenland mallards
[2,50], and hardly anything (except from data in this
study) about their genetics (for a preliminary report, see
[51]). More studies into this population are certainly
needed to draw firm conclusions. Sampling of mallards
from Iceland and the Faroe Islands would make it possible to perform detailed analyses of a potential Atlantic
route of genetic exchange of mallard populations. Note,
however, that all results presented in this paper are
based on the analysis of mtDNA which is a maternally
inherited marker. Patterns discerned from our data are
thus only valid for the female part of the population.
Males are sometimes suggested to also possess a homing
instinct [52] but in contrast to females this is generally
believed to be much less pronounced [53]. It will thus
be important to study nuclear markers in mallard
[43,54-57] on large geographical scales which depict the
genetic structure of both sexes (Kraus et al., manuscript
in preparation). Some sex-bias in migration is not unusual [58] but can be extreme if males are much more
dispersive than females, as demonstrated in a famous
example of the white shark Carcharodon carcharias
[59].
Post-glacial colonization

Clade A is characteristic for Eurasia, and clade B for
North-America, although many individuals in NorthAmerica belong to clade A. Kulikova et al. [10] proposed two phylogeographic hypotheses to explain such a
haplotype distribution, termed “Asian invasion” and
“incomplete lineage sorting” (initially suggested by Avise
et al. [24]). In an Asian invasion scenario the occurrence
of clade B haplotypes in mallards is explained by Asian
mallards moving into a previously mallard-free NorthAmerica, followed by acquiring B-haplotypes by introgressive hybridisation with closely related indigenous
duck species (such as the black duck A. rubripes [60])
resulting in frequently observed mtDNA paraphyly
[27,61,62]. The incomplete lineage sorting hypothesis
rests on the proposed occurrence of a polymorphic
ancestral gene pool (at least with respect to mtDNA
clades) which is facilitated further by large populations
[63,64] and [Kraus et al., manuscript submitted]. These
two hypotheses offer different predictions about the
expected distribution of clade A and clade B haplotypes
in North-America: As a result of an Asian invasion one
would expect to find a gradual decline of clade A haplotypes from western to eastern North-America if we
assume that all immigration from Eurasia took place via
the Aleutian Islands and continues so. We cannot confirm this scenario; clade A haplotypes today occur in the

Page 10 of 15

whole of North-America. This, however, can also be the
result of large dispersal abilities of mallards in NorthAmerica, which can diminish genetic clines relative
quickly. Hence, an Asian invasion cannot be clearly
rejected, either. Kulikova et al. [10] imagine this further
to be due the impact of mallard farming, resulting in
anthropogenic translocation also of clade A mallards.
This explanation resembles one of the possibilities we
propose to explain genetic structure in Europe.
As an alteration of the Asian invasion scenario we
offer additional thoughts based on the extent of the
most recent continental glaciation in North-America.
The opening of the Beringia land bridge on the one
hand enabled exchange of fauna and flora between East
Asia and Alaska because these regions were to a large
extent ice-free. Coincident with the emergence of this
connection, though, the considerable North-America ice
sheet built up south of Alaska, what is today southern
Canada. An Asian invasion thus took place probably
only in the very north of North-America. The clade B
haplotype may have become fixed south of that ice
sheet due to the population bottlenecks. After the
retreat of the glaciers clade B mallards from the south
got into secondary contact with northern clade A mallards. It would thus be interesting to sample mallards
from central and southern North-America with this
hypothesis in mind. To account for and further study
mtDNA paraphyly in duck species such a study would
have to include samples especially from Black Ducks
[24,60], and if possible from other Anas species harbouring clade B haplotypes, too [61,62]. Avise et al.’s
incomplete lineage sorting hypothesis [24] would naturally account for a more even distribution of clades and
is consistent with the idea that a dichromatic (and mitochondrially polymorphic) mallard population gave rise
to its monochromatic sister species by peripatric isolation [65]. But as Kulikova et al. [10] point out it seems
unlikely that only the clade B haplotype gets fixed in all
sister species but not the “original” mallard. We thus
concur with Kulikova et al. [10] in concluding that a
complicated mix of historical, recent and anthropogenic
factors shaped the current world-wide mallard population structure. The results we can add from analysing
>100 additional European mallards and the outcome of
our demographic modelling study substantiate this
claim.

Conclusions
Many aspects of the biology of ducks are known when it
concerns ecological and management parameters (see
[11] and references therein for a recent overview), and
also their phylogenetic placement has frequently been
assessed, e.g. [61,66]. Surprisingly, only few studies have
contributed to discern population genetic patterns for

Kraus et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:99
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/99

ducks, especially mallards. The information collected in
this study is essentially representing the first complete
assessment of the world-wide mallard population genetic
structure in this duck. With more than 300 samples from
the whole distribution range of the mallard we do not find
intermediate haplotypes between clade A and B, or additional discernable clades. Our data and analyses corroborate the conclusion of Kulikova et al. [10] that a
complicated mix of historical, recent and anthropogenic
factors shaped the current world-wide mallard population
structure. Further, we offer an additional hypothesis on
how the current haplotype distribution emerged: a partial
Asian invasion that took place only in northern NorthAmerica, which was ice-free at the last glacial maximum,
followed by secondary contact with the southerly mallard
population in North-America in which clade B haplotypes
could have been fixed. A study to address this hypothesis
would need to additionally analyse mallard samples from
several well-spaced localities throughput central and southern North-America, as well to pay attention to Anas species closely related to mallards, often bearing clade B
haplotypes themselves [61,62]. Mallards form an enormously large population. In the northern hemisphere, the
population is structured deeply into two major clades, but
within these landmasses the populations are very homogenous (and perhaps panmictic) in which the concept of flyway do not contribute to a further understanding of
mallard population genetic structure. Homogeneity over
thousands of kilometres facilitates the spread of diseases
such as Avian Influenza. Between the two landmasses there
may be a little gene flow, apparently in west - east direction
across the Bering Strait. The genetic distinction between
the OW and the NW is not eroded away by this gene flow,
and apparently arose during the last Glacial Maximum.
Even though we refute the flyway concept for mallards
as a representation of biological realities of geographic
structuring of populations, we would like to point out
that waterfowl can very well be managed on the basis of
a flyway concept: the North American success story of
waterfowl population increases over the last century
underpins that success. In that sense, flyways ought to
be viewed as ‘problemsheds’ in the sense of the Ecosystem Approach of the Convention on Biological Diversity
and not so much as biological realities.

Methods
Sample collection

Blood from 195 mallards was collected on FTA cards
[67], in most cases by hunters. Exceptions are the localities from Greenland and Norway. There, mallards were
trapped, blood drops on FTA cards were sampled from
the wing or foot vein, and mallards were released again
(animal handling approved by the animal ethical committee of Wageningen University - DEC, the Greenland

Page 11 of 15

Home Rule and the Norwegian Food Safety Authority Forsöksdyrutvalget). Details on sampling localities and
samples can be found in Table 1 and Additional file 2.
A cautionary note is needed for the Greenland samples.
The trapping of these animals most likely resulted in
the catching of a few ducks with several of their chicks
which often entered the trap as a group. This may have
affected some measures of population genetic parameter
(see results and discussion).
For phylogenetic analyses samples were assigned to
continents to visualise their geographic region of origin.
Greenland and the Aleutian Islands were not assigned
to a specific continent, and Alaska and Canada were
treated as separate regions within North-America. For
population genetic analyses, sampling localities were
pooled into biological populations based on hypothesised mallard flyways in Europe [2], Asia [3], and NorthAmerica [4] (Table 1), allowing us to test our data
against these human-made classifications. Samples from
Greenland and the Aleutian Islands were classified as
separate populations for their intermediate status.
DNA isolation and sequencing

DNA was extracted from FTA cards using the Gentra Systems ‘Puregene DNA purification Kit’ (Qiagen, Valencia,
California). The manufacturer’s instructions were followed
with slight modifications for handling the FTA cards: up to
a quarter of the encircled area of the FTA cards (depending
on how much blood was preserved) was cut into small
pieces of approximately 2 mm2 and digested with 60 μg
Proteinase K (Sigma- Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) in 600 μl
Cell Lysis Solution (Gentra Systems) at 55°C over night.
Subsequently, proteins were precipitated with 200 μl Protein Precipitation Solution (Gentra Systems) and spun
down together with the FTA card material. DNA in the
supernatant was precipitated with isopropanol and washed
with 70% ethanol. Quantity and purity of the DNA were
measured using a Nanodrop ND1000.
PCR amplification targeted the 5’end of the mtDNA
control region which is homologous to positions 79-773
in the chicken (Gallus gallus) mitochondrial genome
[68]. In some duck species the presence of ‘numts’
(nuclear copies of mtDNA) was proposed in this region
[69] but previous examination of mallard sequences did
not reveal evidence for this [10]. Reactions were performed in 12 μl containing 30 ng genomic DNA as template, 3 μl STE buffer, 5.5 μl Abgene Mastermix
(ThermoScientific) and 0.25 μl of each primer (10 mM):
L78 [69] (forward) and H774 [70] (reverse). PCR amplification was done in a BioMetra Thermocycler (Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) under the following cycling
conditions: 7 minutes initial denaturation at 94°C, followed by 45 cycles of 20 seconds at 94°C, 20 seconds at
49°C and 1 minute at 72°C, completed by 7 minutes

Kraus et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:99
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/99

final elongation at 72°C. Quality and quantity of the
PCR product was determined by gel electrophoresis and
the product was purified by vacuum filtration on a
Millipore Multiscreen PCR plate. Forward and reverse
DNA strands were cycle-sequenced using the ABI Big
Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit 3.1 under the following cycling conditions: 1 minute initial denaturation
at 96°C followed by 25 cycles of 10 seconds at 96°C, 5
seconds at 49°C, and final elongation of 4 minutes at
60°C. The sequencing reaction products were precipitated by sodium acetate and ethanol to purify the product, followed by capillary sequencing on an ABI 3730
DNA Analyzer. The forward sequences were verified
with the sequence of the reverse strand in MEGA4 [71];
some manual corrections where needed. If the forward
sequence was absent, or only partially resolved, the
reverse strand was used and aligned with the other
sequences for verification. Additionally, 151 published
sequences from studies of Kulikova et al. [10,27] were
downloaded from GenBank [28] (accession numbers:
AY506868-AY506870; AY506873-AY506901; AY506904AY506908; AY506910-AY506917; AY506919-AY506944;
AY506974-AY506984; AY928831-AY928899). Altogether, these sequences were aligned in MEGA4 [71]
using the ClustalW algorithm [72] under default settings. Names of haplotypes defined in the studies by
Kulikova et al. [10,27] were preserved.

Demographic modelling

A phylogenetic tree of the haplotype sequences was constructed in MEGA4 [71], using the Neighbour-Joining algorithm [30] with 500 bootstrap replicates. Evolutionary
distances were computed under the Tajima Nei model
[73]. All positions containing alignment gaps and missing
data were eliminated from the dataset for tree construction
(complete deletion option). Further, a phylogenetic network
was constructed in TCS [74] (version 1.21) by statistical
parsimony, here, treating alignment gaps as fifth state.

To make inferences about the extent of migration
between Old World (OW) and New World (NW) we
modelled the demographic history of mallards by coalescent simulations under an “Isolation with Migration”
(IM) model [25,26], as implemented in the program
IMa2 (Linux version 10.13.10). OW and NW samples
were treated as belonging to distinct populations based
on their sampling locality. Greenland and Aleutian samples were excluded because of their possible intermediate status. Upper bounds for parameter priors were
estimated during consecutive preliminary runs of the
program, based on initial estimates of theta as advised
in the manual of IMa2. The final values used for population size, migration rate and splitting time were: -q
800, -m 0.34, -t 23.448. We ran 60 Markov chains in
parallel under a geometric heating scheme (option -hfg),
with the hottest chain being b = 0.5 and the coldest
chain b = 0.975. Estimated parameters in IMa2 are
scaled to the mutation rate. To convert them into
demographic units we used a mutation rate of 4.8 × 108
(confidence interval 3.1-6.9 × 10-8) substitutions per
site per year initially published for a wood duck [39].
This rate also produced sensible results in a study of
two other ducks of the genus Anas [81,82] and needs to
be multiplied by the number of nucleotides in the
sequence alignment (here, 622) to obtain the substitutions per locus per year to be used for IM analysis.
From the two sequence mutation models available in
IMa2 we chose HKY [83] which is the applicable model
for mtDNA control region sequences [84]. Several run
time settings with different heating schemes and durations were explored, all yielding essentially the same
outcome. The final simulation, for which we report the
results here, was run for a burn-in period of 360,000
steps (they reached convergence already after a few
10,000 steps), and afterwards 26,000 genealogies were
sampled every 100 steps from a total 2,600,000 steps.

Population genetic analyses

Additional material

Phylogenetic analyses

The basic population genetic parameters nucleotide
diversity (π) and haplotype diversity (dH) for each flyway was calculated with DnaSP [75]. Fu’s FS [29] was
calculated in Arlequin 3.5.1.2 [76], and evaluated for statistical significance by 16,000 simulated samples in order
to guarantee a less than 1% difference with the exact
probability in 99% of the cases [77]. Population differentiation was assessed by Wright’s F-statistics [31], and
partitioning of genetic variance among and within
groups was investigated by analyses of molecular variance (AMOVA [78-80]). Calculations were also performed in Arlequin 3.5.1.2 [76] from pairwise nucleotide
differences, and statistical significance tested by 16,000
permutations.
