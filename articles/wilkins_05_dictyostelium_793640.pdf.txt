information

Conclusion: These results suggest that the unexpectedly large number of RasGEF genes reflects
an evolutionary expansion of the range of Ras signaling rather than functional redundancy or the
presence of multiple pseudogenes.

interactions

Results: We have searched the genome for sequences encoding RasGEFs. Despite its relative
simplicity, we find that the Dictyostelium genome encodes at least 25 RasGEFs, with a few other
genes encoding only parts of the RasGEF consensus domains. All appear to be expressed at some
point in development. The 25 genes include a wide variety of domain structures, most of which
have not been seen in other organisms. The LisH domain, which is associated with microtubule
binding, is seen particularly frequently; other domains that confer interactions with the
cytoskeleton are also common. Disruption of a sample of the novel genes reveals that many have
clear phenotypes, including altered morphology and defects in chemotaxis, slug phototaxis and
thermotaxis.

refereed research

Background: Dictyostelium discoideum is a eukaryote with a simple lifestyle and a relatively small
genome whose sequence has been fully determined. It is widely used for studies on cell signaling,
movement and multicellular development. Ras guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (RasGEFs) are
the proteins that activate Ras and thus lie near the top of many signaling pathways. They are
particularly important for signaling in development and chemotaxis in many organisms, including
Dictyostelium.

Background

Ras proteins are small GTPases that sit at the center of
numerous signaling pathways in essentially all eukaryotes [1].
Their activity is controlled by which guanine nucleotide is
bound. When it is GDP, the Ras proteins are inactive and do
not bind to their targets. Guanine-nucleotide exchange factors (RasGEFs) catalyze the replacement of GDP with GTP
[2]. This makes the Ras proteins active, and able to bind multiple activators and signal transducers. RasGEFs are therefore the initiators of Ras signaling, and understanding their
behavior is the key to understanding Ras signaling.

Multiple roles of Ras pathways
The RAS gene was originally described as the cellular counterpart of a viral oncogene, v-ras [3]. The virally encoded protein, which is constitutively GTP-bound even in the absence
of RasGEFs and is therefore constantly active [4], causes
unchecked mitogenesis and proliferation in appropriate cell
lines. Normal mammalian cells encode three different Ras
families, Ha-Ras, Ki-Ras and N-Ras, all members of which
are highly similar to one another. Examination of tumors
from numerous patients has since confirmed that endogenous Ras has a key role in growth control - as many as 90%
of pancreatic carcinomas contain a mutated Ras gene similar
to v-ras.
The connection between Ras and growth has now been found
to be far more complex. In primary cultures, expression of
activated Ras causes apoptosis, not unrestricted growth, and
activation of Ras has been shown to cause a range of effects
including increased cell motility [5], macropinocytosis [6],
and alterations in cell identity [7]. These changes are mediated by a range of downstream effectors, most important of
which are the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K) and the protein kinase Raf [8,9].
RasGEFs were first identified in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
in which loss of the CDC25 gene was found to arrest growth
by blocking Ras activation of adenylyl cyclase [10]. This was
followed by the identification of Drosophila Son of sevenless
(Sos) [11] and mammalian hSos1 [12], each of which contains
a catalytic domain related to that in CDC25. Hundreds of RasGEFs are now known. All share a considerable stretch of
homology, including at least two discrete domains - an
amino-terminal domain of unclear function (although crystallographic evidence suggests a structural role [13]) and a
carboxy-terminal one that mediates GTP-GDP exchange.

RasGEFs and signaling
In general, RasGEFs are now seen as signaling adaptors and
integrators; they couple various signaling processes at the cell
membrane to Ras and thus to changes inside the cell. The best
understood signals to Ras derive from receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs). When RTKs are stimulated by their ligands,
they recruit adaptors such as Grb2 [14], which bind directly to
RasGEFs. This recruitment localizes the RasGEFs to the

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/8/R68

membrane and thus brings them into proximity with Ras [15].
Other RasGEFs are activated by different signals, for example
Ca2+ [16], but the underlying mechanism is thought to be similar. The domains that surround the RasGEF catalytic regions
are therefore critical, as they mediate membrane localization
and activation.
Several major families of RasGEFs can be found in the literature, classified by their domain structure. The most widely
known is typified by the product of the Drosophila Sos gene
[11]. Members contain one or two pleckstrin homology (PH)
domains, implying upstream regulation by membrane phospholipids. They also contain a Dbl homology (DH) domain,
which is also found in GEFs for the small GTPases Rho and
Rac, although these domains' association with Rac signaling
is far less clear than their proven roles as Ras regulators [17].
The EPAC family of GEFs contains cyclic nucleotide monophosphate binding domain (cNMP) motifs that bind cAMP
and activate the GTPase Rap when cAMP is present [18]. Similarly, the Ras-GRF family of RasGEFs contain EF hands and
activate Ras in response to calcium and diacylglycerol signaling [16]. A significant number of known RasGEF relatives
have no obvious signaling domains. The best known of these
is C3G, which is thought to activate the Ras-like GTPase Rap1
[19].

Ras pathways in Dictyostelium
The social ameba Dictyostelium discoideum uses Ras pathways to control multiple signaling processes including cell
movement, polarity and cytokinesis, chemotaxis, macropinocytosis and multicellular development [20,21]. It is notable
for the relatively large number of Ras subfamily members
(there are 15 encoded in the genome, including 11 that most
closely resemble Ras, three Rap and one Rheb [22]). All of the
six so far studied appear to have nonredundant and important roles in cell physiology [23-26] (although six of the
remaining ras genes are exceptionally similar [22]). This is
the more surprising as Dictyostelium does not encode RTKs
[27]. As described previously, RTKs are thought to be one of
the major inputs for Ras signaling in mammalian cells. In the
absence of RTKs, the best prospects for finding upstream regulators would appear to be through identification of adaptor
proteins and binding partners. Such proteins are presumably
responsible for recruiting RasGEFs to the membrane and
thus controlling their activity. However, two of the four Dictyostelium RasGEFs characterized thus far (aimless [28] and
rasgefB [29]) offer few clues to their regulation. Unlike nearly
all other RasGEFs described in the literature, which contain a
panoply of protein-interaction and regulatory domains
including SH3, PH, IQ, and PDZ domains, neither Aimless
nor RasGEFB contains recognizable signaling domains
[28,29]. Two other RasGEF family members, GbpC and
GbpD [30], on the other hand, contain multiple domains,
including cGMP-binding domains, and in GbpC, a kinase
domain, leucine-rich repeats, and a DEP domain. None of
these domains have been shown to regulate GEF activity in

Genome Biology 2005,

Dictyostelium, although in the mammalian EPAC family a
cAMP-binding cNMP domain is thought to regulate GEF
activity [31]. It therefore seems plausible that cGMP regulates
the activity of at least GbpC. The limited number of signaling
domains in the other RasGEFs has been a serious obstacle to
understanding Ras family signaling in Dictyostelium; to date,
no binding proteins or signaling partners have been
discovered.

Sequence and domain analysis

Identification of RasGEF genes

The only protein described in the literature that resembles the
Dictyostelium RasGEF homologs is the C3G RapGEF [19],
but as this similarity is based on an absence of other defined
signaling domains rather than any positive homology, it
seems uninformative. In particular, the Dictyostelium gene

Genome Biology 2005, 6:R68

information

Four further genes encode the carboxy-terminal RasGEF
homology domain but not the RasGEF amino-terminal
domain, and might therefore be expected to be specific for
Ras-related proteins which are not part of the Ras family
proper. We have named these gflA, gflB, gflC and gflD (full
details can be found in Dictybase [32]). It is not yet clear
whether these are likely to be RasGEFs with a subset of normal functions or GEFs for more distant relatives of Ras.

The third principal family of mammalian RasGEFs is the calcium-regulated Ras-GRFs [16]. These do not appear to be
present in Dictyostelium at all. Neither the EF hands present
in Ras-GRFs nor any other clear calcium-binding motifs are
found in any of the 25 RasGEFs examined here.

interactions

Four of the RasGEF genes we found have been described previously. The aimless and rasgefB genes have roles in chemotaxis and endocytosis, respectively [28,29], while the gbpC
and gbpD genes encode cGMP-binding proteins which are
thought to couple intracellular cGMP to other signaling pathways [30]. For the sake of consistency, we have renamed
these genes gefA, gefB, gefT and gefU.

The two previously described cGMP-binding proteins RasGEFT and RasGEFU (also known as cGMP-binding proteins
C and D [30]) have cNMP domains, like the mammalian
EPAC family. RasGEFU is somewhat similar to EPAC family
members, but the three cNMP domains lie beyond the RasGEF amino-terminal and RasGEF domains, unlike the usual
upstream location, and the G-protein-associated DEP
domain is replaced by a GRAM membrane-localization
domain. These large-scale changes make it seem unlikely that
EPACs and Dictyostelium cGMP-binding RasGEFs are evolutionary orthologs. It seems more likely that convergent evolution has selected independent cyclic nucleotide-regulated
GEFs. This is supported by phylogenetic analysis (see below),
which failed to group RasGEFT and RasGEFU with human
EPAC.

refereed research

An additional domain, known as RasGEF_N (hereafter called
RasGEF amino-terminal for clarity), is found in nearly all
'true' RasGEFs (proteins that clearly activate Ras in vivo) as
well as in GEFs for a number of related proteins such as Rap1.
After excluding sequences that did not contain complete copies of both RasGEF and RasGEF amino-terminal domains, we
were left with 25 sequences encoding Dictyostelium RasGEFs. There were no obvious pseudogenes - all 25 sequences
contain a clear open reading frame (ORF) and both domains
were complete and uninterrupted.

We were surprised to find that none of the Dictyostelium RasGEFs resembled members of known families with signaling
motifs. Only one of the 25 predicted proteins, GefC, includes
a DH/Rho-GEF domain like Sos family members [17]. However, unlike the Sos family, GefC does not contain a PH
domain. Instead, its amino-terminal region contains three
domains that resemble RCC1, a GEF for the small GTPase
Ran [37]. Ran is involved in the control of nuclear transport
and mitosis, and is unusual in that it does not contain lipid
adducts and is therefore not located at the plasma membrane
[38]. There is no clear precedent for a connection between
Ras and RCC1 signaling.

deposited research

The assembly of the Dictyostelium genome is now complete,
representing more than 99% of the genes [27]. This allowed
us to estimate the total number of RasGEF sequences. We
searched the assembled sequence using FASTA and
TBLASTN programs and the RasGEF catalytic sequence (also
known as the RasGEF domain) as bait. Approximately 30
sequences gave significant scores with these programs.

As described earlier, the presence of signaling domains separate from the RasGEF and RasGEF amino-terminal domain
has been a central part of the identification of Ras signaling
pathways in higher eukaryotes [33]. However, half of the 25
genes we have identified contain no such clues. Figure 1
shows the domain structure of the predicted products from
the 25 complete RasGEFs. Eight, including RasGEFB, contain
no domains detected by SMART [34] or PFAM [35], other
than the two RasGEF domains. A further five contain no additional domains other than the enigmatic LisH domain, whose
function is thought to relate to motility and microtubule function but is poorly understood [36], and one contains only two
F-boxes, motifs connected with ubiquitination and protein
breakdown rather than with upstream signaling.

In this paper we describe an unexpectedly large number - at
least 25 - of predicted RasGEFs in the Dictyostelium genome.
Several of these contain different known signaling domains
and others contain none. This suggests an unprecedentedly
complex and poorly understood network of Ras signaling in
an organism whose signaling otherwise appears relatively
simple.

products lack SH3-binding polyproline domains at their
amino termini, which suggests that they have no strong evolutionary relationship with C3G. Again, phylogenetic analysis
supports this view (see below).

Actin- and Rho-binding RasGEFs
Three members of the Dictyostelium RasGEF family have
domains that suggest a direct link with the actin cytoskeleton.
Two contain domains that are associated with direct binding
to F-actin. RasGEFF contains three tandem kelch repeats,
while RasGEFP contains a calponin homology (CH) domain.
A third, RasGEFD, contains a RhoGAP homology domain.
While most authors have associated this with inactivation of
Rac- and Rho-family members, there is some evidence that
some RhoGAP homology domains are found in downstream
effectors. We were intrigued to note that Saccharomyces
BEM2, a RhoGAP homolog that is required for cell polarity
and normal actin dynamics [39], also appears to contain RasGEF and RasGEF amino-terminal domains that have not
been described in the literature. This suggests that RasGEFD
might perform a similar role in Dictyostelium to BEM2 in
Saccharomyces, although no obvious phenotype was seen in
growing gefD knockouts (see below).

Phylogenetic analysis
We constructed phylogenetic trees using the conserved RasGEF domains of all the Dictyostelium proteins, both with and
without a selection of mammalian RasGEFs for comparison
(Figure 2). To our surprise, few groupings were strongly supported during bootstrapping. In general, it is clear that RasGEFF, RasGEFO and RasGEFH are the least similar to other
RasGEFs in Dictyostelium and elsewhere. RasGEFI and RasGEFJ are highly similar, suggesting they they arose from a
relatively recent gene duplication. Two other pairings, RasGEFs B and V and RasGEFs R and S, were also supported in
more than 50% of bootstraps. Other, larger groups that might
subdivide the RasGEFs according to function were conspicuously poorly supported, suggesting that the diversification of
RasGEF genes happened relatively early in the divergence of
Dictyostelium. There is also no evidence that the division of
mammalian RasGEFs into SOS, RasGRP, EPAC, C3G and
RalGDS families had occurred when Dictyostelium diverged
from the animal line.

Expression during growth and development

RasGEFs was connected with growth (the first role found for

dogenes or evolutionary relics, which are frequently not
expressed.
In general, three patterns of expression were seen. The largest
group of genes, which includes gefA, D, F, H, J and L, is
expressed in growing cells and with relatively slight changes
throughout development. A second group, comprising gefB
and K, is expressed at low levels during growth with a sharp
increase early in development, while the third, typified by
gefC and E, is only expressed after about 12 h of development.
These results are consistent with varied roles for RasGEFs in
multiple aspects of the Dictyostelium life cycle.

Disruption of a sample of RasGEF genes

Genome Biology 2005, 6:R68

information

All of the mutants we obtained grow normally, with the exception of gefB mutants, which grow relatively normally on bacterial plates but are unable to grow in axenic culture due to a
loss of fluid-phase endocytosis (Figure 3). The morphology of

While testing the late development of mutants, we observed
an apparent lack of slug phototaxis in gefE mutants, despite
morphologically normal slugs and fruiting bodies. We therefore assessed slug phototaxis in each of the mutants apart
from gefB, which does not form slugs. Figure 6a shows the
trails from a sample of slugs migrating towards a lateral light
source. Mutants in gefC, gefD, gefG and gefK (not shown)
exhibit normal phototaxis, but gefE and gefL mutants are
plainly aberrant. The problems with the two strains appear to
be different. gefE slugs migrate similar distances to the wild
type, but far less accurately towards the light source, whereas

refereed research

There are two obvious ways to explain the unexpectedly large
number of RasGEF genes in Dictyostelium. The first would be
that these genes are mainly redundant, and that each biological function of a RasGEF is mediated by several Dictyostelium genes. The other possibility is that Dictyostelium has
greatly broadened the scope of Ras signaling at some stage in
its evolution, and that most GEFs are required for a distinct
signaling process. To distinguish between these possibilities,
we disrupted a sample of RasGEF genes and searched for phenotypes. gefA (aimless) had already been disrupted [40] and
gefB was disrupted during the initial part of this work [41];
each mutant has a clear phenotype. We further attempted to
disrupt GEFs C, D, E, F, G, K and L. We were successful in all
cases except gefF, which could not be disrupted even after
several attempts. This suggests that gefF might have an
important role during growth, but confirmation will require
disruption in diploids [42].

growing cells is apparently normal for each strain apart from
gefB mutants, which appear flattened and polar (Figure 4) in
a manner reminiscent of growing nonaxenic cells. Similarly,
the chemotactic aggregation and development of all mutants
examined here except gefB were apparently normal (Figure
5), forming morphologically normal slugs and fruiting bodies
with the usual timing. As previously described, gefB mutants
aggregate but form no slugs and make highly aberrant fruiting bodies [41]. Three RasGEF mutants described elsewhere
show abnormal chemotaxis - gefA/aimless and gefT are both
seriously defective [28,43], though gefA can be coaxed to
make rather aberrantly shaped slugs, while gefU cells are
hyperpolar and better at chemotaxis than wild type [43].

Unusually for slug phototaxis mutants, the gefE and gefL
mutant slugs are also affected in thermotaxis, although the
severity of the phenotypes is reversed. Slugs from both
mutant strains show diminished but measurable thermotaxis,
but gefL mutant slugs seem particularly insensitive to temperature gradients (Figure 6c).

Discussion
gefB −

gefC −

We initiated this work to assess whether the large number of
RasGEFs in Dictyostelium were functionally redundant, or
whether each had a discrete function. Functional redundancy
would be caused by groups of RasGEFs having shared or
poorly differentiated functions. In particular, one model for
RasGEF action suggests that Ras signaling works as a
complex network in which specific signals can be transduced
by multiple RasGEFs, each of which can activate multiple different Ras proteins. If this model were correct, deletion of any
one RasGEF (or indeed Ras) would cause very slight effects,
with double and multiple mutants causing progressively
more significant deficiencies in a range of different Ras
pathways.

photographed using a dissecting microscope. The white bar represents 2
mm. Mutants in gefK and gefL were observed on different occasions but
were similarly comparable to the parental strain.

gefL slugs are both less accurate and migrate shorter distances, a phenotype that is frequently observed in phototaxis
mutants [44].
A more detailed analysis of slug photo- and thermotaxis is
shown in Figure 6b and 6c. Both gefE and gefL mutant slugs
are clearly poor in phototaxis assays at all cell densities, with
gefE mutants the worst affected (Figure 6b, inset) - gefE
mutant slugs are at least 20 times less phototactically accurate than wild type, though some orientation is clearly visible
(Figure 5a) and measurable (Figure 6b, inset). This behavior
is strikingly reminiscent of the phenotype of rasD mutants,
which also move normally but with greatly reduced accuracy
[25]. Taken together with the expression pattern of gefE,
which closely resembles that of rasD, this suggests that RasGEFE is the GEF that causes the most RasD activation during
phototaxis.

The work described in this paper, in agreement with previous
work from our labs (for example [42]) and others [43], suggests that RasGEFs have relatively precisely defined roles. Of
the RasGEF genes that have now been disrupted, six out of
ten had clear phenotypes. We presume that a more complete
study of the minute details of the life cycle would also reveal
phenotypes in some of the remaining four. This would not be
predicted if genetic redundancy was the rule. These results
are somewhat distorted, because the RasGEFs were in general named in the order in which they were isolated. The
majority of the genes we disrupted were identified relatively
early in the lifetime of the cDNA project in Tsukuba, Japan,
and therefore tend to be expressed at reasonably high levels.
Later genes were identified by screening sequences provided
by the genome project and are therefore likely to be either
expressed at lower levels or under non-standard conditions,
for example, environmental responses that are not seen
under laboratory conditions. Even with this caution in mind,
though, the clear phenotypes suggest that Dictyostelium uses
relatively simple Ras pathways.
This is further supported by the similarities between specific
Ras and GEF mutants. As previously described, Mutants in
gefB and rasS behave similarly [23,29]. Likewise, in this work
we show that gefE resembles rasD in both mutant phenotype
and expression pattern. The aimless/gefA phenotype is also
very similar to that of rasC [24,28], although one paper suggests a connection between rasG, gefA and the effector
protein RIP3 [45]. Again, this suggests that Dictyostelium
Ras pathways are relatively linear, with each GEF in general
acting on a single Ras protein, rather than the networks that
some might have expected.

members [22]. In mammalian cells, the catalytic domains of
RapGEFs are indistinguishable from RasGEFs, and frequently contain no obvious signaling domains much like several of the GEF genes described in this paper. We have
connected three of the RasGEFs with specific Ras proteins,
leaving 22 RasGEFs to couple to the smaller number of
remaining Ras family members. This inequality implies that

This, of course, raises the question of what role is played by
the other GEFs we describe. The rasB gene has not yet been
disrupted, despite multiple attempts. It is thus not currently
possible to discern its biological role. No RasGEF genes have
been found to cause phenotypes that resemble those of rasG
mutants. Finally, at least two other Ras-family proteins (RasX
and Rap1) are likely to be activated by RasGEF family

each Ras protein is likely to be activated by multiple
RasGEFs, perhaps explaining the slight phenotypes seen in
the unpaired RasGEF mutants.
We have not studied the gflA, gflB, gflC and gflD genes, which
encode carboxy-terminal RasGEF homology domains without RasGEF amino-terminal domains, and might therefore be
expected to be specific for Ras-related proteins that are not
part of the Ras family proper. It is not entirely clear what this
might mean for Dictyostelium. Two Ras proteins (RasG and
RasD) are most similar to the canonical mammalian Ras
families, and others (RasB, RasC, the as-yet unpublished
RasX, and RasS) are less closely related to mammalian Ras
while still plainly being part of the Ras family [22]. We suspect from the phenotypes of the gefB mutants that RasGEFB
acts directly upon RasS. This would imply that the gfl genes
act on more distant relatives of canonical Ras than RasS,
which would be characterized as unusual small GTPases (for
example the RasX family or RsmA-K [22]) rather than members of the Ras family proper.
Above all, the complexity in Ras pathways in Dictyostelium is
unexpected for a relatively simple organism with no receptor
tyrosine kinases [27]. It might be that the limited range of
receptors was a driving force for diversification of Ras signaling during evolution, or it might be that a large number of
RasGEFs are highly specialized for specific subsets of some
complex role (detecting and integrating starvation signals
and quorum factors, for example). A complete understanding
will require further analysis of RasGEF genes, but above all a
better knowledge of the range of signals that Dictyostelium
cells use in their normal biological context.

Conclusion

The clear suggestion from our work is that the unexpectedly
large number of Dictyostelium RasGEFs derive from an unusually diverse range of inputs to Ras pathways, rather than
large-scale redundancy or multiple pseudogenes following
gene duplications. Identifying the input signals, and the
mechanisms by which they connect to RasGEF activation, will
be a major future challenge for Dictyostelium biology.

Materials and methods
Identification of genes encoding RasGEFs
Known and previously identified rasGEF genes were used to
perform TBLASTN searches against the whole dataset generated by the Dictyostelium Sequencing Consortium [46-49].
In addition, IPRscan results for the predicted proteome of the
previously published chromosome 2 [50] were screened for
motifs IPR001895 (RasGEF) and IPR000651 (RasGEF
amino-terminal [51]). In addition, we applied hmmsearch
(HMMer package [52]) to scan the protein-translated predraft genome assembly (ORFs expected to be about 30 amino
acids) for Pfam motifs PF00617 (RasGEF) and PF00618

http://genomebiology.com/2005/6/8/R68

(RasGEF amino-terminal). Contig sequences generated as
described in [53] were extended and verified as described
[50] to obtain full and high-quality coverage of the genes.
Gene models were predicted using geneid [54]. The Dictyostelium genome is housed and curated at dictyBase [32].

Domain analysis
The predicted complete amino-acid sequences were analyzed
using the SMART program at the SMART website in Heidelberg [34]. In initial searches, borderline matches and
matches from other libraries were included to ensure that
important genes or domains were not excluded (in particular,
several of the RasGEF amino-terminal domains are close to
the borderline of significance, on either side). Images were
copied directly from the SMART website.

Cell growth and development
D. discoideum AX3 and AX2 cells were either grown axenically in HL5 medium or on a bacterial food source at 22°C
[55]. For bacterially grown cells, SM agar plates were inoculated with 105-106 Dictyostelium cells plus a suspension of
Klebsiella in LB. To follow differentiation, cells growing exponentially from bacterial plates or axenic growth media were
washed three times in KK2 (16.5 mM KH2PO4, 3.8 mM
K2HPO4 pH 6.0) and plated on KK2 agar or nitrocellulose filters (Millipore). Transformation was performed by a modification of Howard et al. [56]; briefly, cells growing
exponentially were mixed with 25 µg of linearized DNA and
electroporated in a BioRad gene pulser at 1.0 or 1.1 V, 3 µF
with a 5-ohm resistance in series. After 10 min incubation on
ice, cells were placed at 22°C for 15 sec in the presence of 2 µl
healing solution (100 mM MgCl2, 100 mM CaCl2) and then
HL-5 added. Blasticidin-S (ICN) or G418 (Calbiochem) (10
µg/ml) was added 24 h after electroporation. After 7-8 days
antibiotic selection, transformants were cloned on lawns of
Klebsiella growing on SM agar.

Gene-disruption constructs
Genes were disrupted using the blasticidin cassette from
pRHI100, a derivative of pBrs∆Bam [57] with additional
restriction sites. Clones for each RasGEF kindly provided by
the Japanese cDNA database were cut with an appropriate
restriction enzyme to generate a site near the middle of the
cDNA, and the Bsr gene was inserted into the gap using a
rapid ligation kit (NEB). The knockout construct was cut out
of the vector (usually using SalI and NotI) and electroporated
into axenic Dictyostelium as described above. Disrupted
genes were identified using Southern blots with the entire
cDNA used as a probe.

Northern blotting and RT-PCR
Development of D. discoideum cells, isolation of RNA at different time points of development (0, 4, 8, 12, 14 and 18 h)
and Northern blotting was performed as described [58]. RNA
(5 µg) from each time point was reverse transcribed with random prime hexanucleotides using M-MLV RNase H(-)

reports

Qualitative phototaxis tests were performed as described previously [44] by using sterile spatula-style toothpicks to transfer cells to charcoal agar plates from the edges of colonies
growing on Klebsiella aerogenes lawns. Phototaxis was
scored after 48 h incubation at 21°C with a lateral light source.
For quantitative phototaxis experiments, washed amebae
were inoculated onto the centers of charcoal agarose plates
(pH 6.5) at various densities and incubated with a lateral light
source for 48 h at 21°C. For quantitative thermotaxis experiments, washed amebae were inoculated onto the centers of
water agarose plates (~2.4 × 106 cells/cm2) and incubated for
72 h in darkness on a heat bar producing a 0.2°C/cm temperature gradient at the agarose surface. Arbitrary temperature
units correspond to a temperature range of 14°C (T1) to 28°C
(T8), as measured at the center of plates in separate calibration experiments. Slug trails were transferred to PVC disks,
stained with Coomassie Blue, and digitized. Slug orientation
was analyzed using directional statistics [60].
