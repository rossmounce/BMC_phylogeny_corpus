Abstract
Background: Vibrios, which include more than 100 species, are ubiquitous in marine and estuarine environments,
and several of them e.g. Vibrio cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus and V. mimicus, are pathogens for humans.
Pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus strains possess two sets of genes for type III secretion system (T3SS), T3SS1 and
T3SS2. The latter are critical for virulence of the organism and be classified into two distinct phylogroups, T3SS2a
and T3SS2b, which are reportedly also found in pathogenic V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 serogroup strains.
However, whether T3SS2-related genes are present in other Vibrio species remains unclear.
Results: We therefore examined the distribution of the genes for T3SS2 in vibrios other than V. parahaemolyticus
by using a PCR assay targeting both T3SS2a and T3SS2b genes. Among the 32 Vibrio species tested in our study,
several T3SS2-related genes were detected in three species, V. cholerae, V. mimicus and V. hollisae, and most of the
essential genes for type III secretion were present in T3SS2-positive V. cholerae and V. mimicus strains. Moreover,
both V. mimicus strains possessing T3SS2a and T3SS2b were identified. The gene organization of the T3SS2 gene
clusters in V. mimicus strains was fundamentally similar to that of V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae in both
T3SS2a- and T3SS2b-possessing strains.
Conclusions: This study is the first reported evidence of the presence of T3SS2 gene clusters in V. mimicus strains.
This finding thus provides a new insight into the pathogenicity of the V. mimicus species.

Background
The type III secretion system (T3SS) is possessed by
gram-negative bacteria, especially those occurring in animal and plant pathogens, e.g. Yersinia, Shigella, Salmonella, Pseudomonas and Escherichia species [1-3]. The
T3SS secretes and translocates effector proteins into the
cytosol of eukaryotic cells, thus contributing to bacterial
virulence against the host [1]. While the T3SS apparatus
is well conserved in these bacteria, the specific properties of the effectors which are secreted via T3SS and
symptomatic effects caused by the effectors on the host
organism vary widely [1].
Vibrios are gram-negative g-proteobacteria which are
ubiquitous in marine and estuarine environments [4,5].
Several of the more than 100 Vibrio species are

pathogens for fish, shellfish, coral, and mammals [6],
and Vibrio parahaemolyticus was the first species in
which the presence of T3SS was reported [7].
V. parahaemolyticus is a cause of food-borne gastroenteritis in humans, and almost all strains isolated from
diarrheal patients produce the thermostable direct
hemolysin (TDH) and/or the TDH-related hemolysin
(TRH), which are encoded by the tdh and trh genes,
respectively [8-10]. V. parahaemolyticus strains, which
exhibit the Kanagawa phenomenon (KP), a beta-hemolysis detectable on a special blood agar (Wagatsuma agar)
[11], possess two tdh genes, tdhA and tdhS, but not the
trh gene [10,12,13]. In contrast, KP-negative clinical V.
parahaemolyticus strains possess the trh gene only or
both the trh and tdh genes. Genome sequencing of the
KP-positive V. parahaemolyticus strain RIMD2210633
demonstrated that it possesses two sets of the genes for
T3SS on chromosomes 1 and 2 (T3SS1 and T3SS2,
respectively) [7]. It has further been demonstrated that
T3SS2 is involved in enterotoxicity of the organism, and

is considered to be an important factor in the pathogenicity of diarrheal illness [14]. The T3SS2 genes are located
on a pathogenicity island (PAI) known as Vp-PAI on
chromosome 2, and the genes were found in KP-positive,
but not in KP-negative strains [7,14,15].
After the discovery of the T3SS genes in V. parahaemolyticus, other vibrios such as V. alginolyticus, V. harveyi, V. tubiashii and V. cholerae were also found to
possess the genes for T3SS [14,16-18]. While the T3SSs
of V. alginolyticus, V. harveyi and V. tubiashii, are more
closely related to T3SS1 of V. parahaemolyticus [14],
that of V. cholerae is similar to T3SS2 of V. parahaemolyticus [17]. In addition, several studies have demonstrated that some V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139
serogroup strains, which do not possess the cholera
toxin gene, do possess a set of T3SS genes in a PAI
(VPI-2) on their chromosome [17,19]. It has further
been suggested that the T3SS of non-O1/non-O139 V.
cholerae is also involved in the pathogenicity of the bacterium [17].
In our most recently reported study, we used the
sequencing and PCR assay of the genomic DNA of the
TH3996 strain to detect the presence of a novel PAI
(Vp-PAITH3996) in trh-positive (KP-negative) V. parahaemolyticus strains [20]. The Vp-PAITH3996 was found to
contain a set of genes for T3SS, and the T3SS of the
TH3996 strain to be essential for the enterotoxicity of
this strain [20]. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the
T3SS genes of TH3996 are related to that of
RIMD2210633, but belong to distinct lineage, with the
former known as T3SS2b and the latter as T3SS2a [20].
Subsequent studies showed that T3SS2a and T3SS2b
are present in, respectively, KP-positive and trh-positive
V. parahaemolyticus strains and are also distributed
among pathogenic V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 serogroup strains [20].
A previous study examined the distribution of the
T3SS2-related genes in Vibrio species, but tested only
for the presence of the T3SS2a genes and in a limited
number of strains from each species [14]. In this study,
we re-investigated the distribution of the genes for
T3SS2 in various Vibrio species and targeted both the
T3SS2a and T3SS2b genes.

Results
Distribution of the T3SS2-related genes in Vibrio species

To analyze the distribution of the T3SS2-related genes
in Vibrio species other than V. parahaemolyticus, PCR
assays were performed using oligonucleotide primer
pairs (see Additional file 1) which target the T3SS2related genes present in the Vp-PAI, i.e., vscN2 (encodes
the ATPase), vscC2N2R2S2T2U2, vcrD2 (apparatus proteins of T3SS), vopB2D2 (translocons), or vopCLP (effectors) [14,21-24], for 32 Vibrio species. The design of the

Page 2 of 10

PCR primer pairs was based on the gene sequences in
strains RIMD2210633 or TH3996, representing T3SS2a
or T3SS2b, respectively (see Additional file 1). We
tested multiple strains of several species in the genus
Vibrio which are implicated as pathogenic for humans,
that is, V. vulnificus (10 strains), V. fluvialis (12 strains),
V. furnissii (12 strains), V. hollisae (5 strains), V. cholerae (46 strains) and V. mimicus (15 strains). For other
species, one strain of each was tested (see Additional file
2).
The assay demonstrated that, in addition to part of the
V. cholerae strains, as previously reported, amplicons of
the expected size of at least several of the T3SS2 genes
were obtained from all of the V. hollisae strains and
some of the V. mimicus strains. However, none of the
genes tested in any of the remaining 29 species could be
amplified (see Additional file 2).
Among the 46 non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae strains
isolated from patients (28 strains) or environments (18
strains), we obtained the amplicons of at least one gene
encoding the apparatus protein of the T3SS2a genes
from 10 strains (see below). In two V. cholerae strains,
which constitute the PCR products of T3SS2b genes, at
least six genes for the apparatus and two genes for the
translocons could be amplified (see Additional file 2).
We therefore concluded that the aforementioned 10 V.
cholerae strains were T3SS2a-positive and the two were
T3SS2b-positive. Of these 12 T3SS2-positive strains,
only one, the V. cholerae strain RIMD2214415, which
possesses T3SS2a genes, was isolated from the environment. Therefore, as far as we could determine in this
study, T3SS2 genes of V. cholerae tend to be found in
clinical strains rather than in environmental isolates.
In all of the five V. hollisae strains tested, the amplicons for three genes of T3SS2a, vscN2, vscR2 and
vscT2, were obtained with the PCR assay, but no other
T3SS2a genes or any T3SS2b genes could be amplified.
The PCR products for vscN2R2T2 could be partially
sequenced, which confirmed that the amplicons that
could be obtained are more closely related to the
T3SS2a than to the T3SS2b genes (data not shown).
The PCR products of the genes for T3SS2 were
detected in nine of 15 clinical or environmental V.
mimicus strains. The genes encoding the apparatus proteins of T3SS2, vscN2C2R2T2U2 and vcrD2, were amplified by PCR in all the T3SS2-positive V. mimicus strains,
although the amplicons for the genes encoding effector
proteins, i.e., vopCLP, could not be obtained in a few of
these strains (see Additional file 2). Of the nine T3SS2positive strains, at least six genes for the apparatus proteins and two genes for the translocons of T3SS2a
genes could be amplified from eight strains, while PCR
amplification led to the detection in a V. mimicus strain
of the amplicons of the T3SS2b genes, i.e., six genes

Okada et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:302
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/302

encoding the apparatus proteins vscN2C2R2T2U2 and
vcrD2, two genes encoding the translocons vopB2D2,
and two genes for the regulators vtrAB. In the other six
V. mimicus strains, no amplicons of the genes for either
type of T3SS2 could be obtained (see Additional file 2).
Of the nine T3SS2-positive V. mimicus strains, eight
were therefore identified as T3SS2a-positive, and one as
T3SS2b-positive. These findings suggest that, in addition
to their distribution in V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae strains, the genes for T3SS2 are found in V. hollisae and V. mimicus strains, although only three T3SS2
genes were detected in V. hollisae strains.
Distribution of tdh or trh in T3SS2-positive V. cholerae
and V. mimicus strains

In V. parahaemolyticus, the strains which possess the
T3SS2 gene cluster also possess the tdh and/or trh genes
[7,20]. To examine whether the tdh or trh genes also
coexist in T3SS2-possessing V. cholerae and V. mimicus
strains, we performed a PCR assay using the pair of primers (see Additional file 1) which target the tdh or trh
genes of V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633 or TH3996
strains, respectively. Among the T3SS2-possessing V.
mimicus strains, the tdh gene could be detected in all
T3SS2a-positive strains, although no amplicons of the
trh gene could be obtained in V. mimicus strains, while
neither of the amplicons could be obtained in the T3SS2positive V. cholerae strains. To analyze the distribution of
the tdh or trh genes in 12 T3SS2-positive V. cholerae
strains, we performed an additional PCR assay using the
primer set (see Additional file 1) targeting the region
between A33_1702 and the downstream region of the V.
cholerae AM-19226 strain which is homologous with tdh
of V. parahaemolyticus. PCR products could be obtained
for both the T3SS2a- and T3SS2b-positive V. cholerae
strains, except for the RIMD2214321 (T3SS2a-possessing) strain (data not shown). These results suggest that
the tdh gene may be related to the presence of the T3SS2
gene cluster in V. cholerae and V. mimicus strains.
Gene organization of the T3SS2 gene cluster in V.
mimicus

The results presented here demonstrated that some V.
mimicus strains possess the genes for T3SS2a or
T3SS2b. Since the gene organizations of the T3SS2 gene
cluster in the organism were completely unknown, we
attempted to analyze the gene organization of the
T3SS2 region in V. mimicus strains. To this end, we
performed PCR scanning against the genomic DNA of
T3SS2-positive V. mimicus strains RIMD2218080
(T3SS2a) and RIMD2218067 (T3SS2b) by using six
PCR primer pairs for each strain (see Additional file 3).
In the T3SS2a-positive strain RIMD2218080, PCR
products of the expected size were detected for all

Page 3 of 10

primer pairs (data not shown), thus suggesting that the
gene organization of the T3SS2 gene cluster in strain
RIMD2218080 is similar to that of the T3SS2a gene
cluster in V. parahaemolyticus strain RIMD2210633. In
the T3SS2b-positive strain RIMD2218067, amplicons of
the expected size were obtained for five primer pairs,
although the size of the product obtained for a primer
pair between the vopD2 and vopC genes was notably larger, by approximately 5 kb, than that of the region of
the V. parahaemolyticus TH3996 (data not shown).
However, the PCR product which was amplified
between vopD2 and vopP was the same size as that of
the V. parahaemolyticus TH3996 strain. This suggested
that the gene organization of T3SS2 of V. mimicus
RIMD2218067 is similar to that of T3SS2b of V. parahaemolyticus, while a genetic element of approximately
5 kb, which could not be detected in the region of V.
parahaemolyticus strain TH3996, may exist in the
region between the vopP and vopC genes in V. mimicus
strain RIMD2218067.
These findings suggest that the gene organization of
the T3SS2 gene clusters, both T3SS2a and T3SS2b, in
V. mimicus strains are basically similar to those of the
V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae strains.
Phylogenetic analysis of the T3SS2-related genes in V.
mimicus

Next, we analyzed the phylogeny of the T3SS2 genes
identified in V. mimicus strains. The purified amplicons
of the genes for vscN2R2T2 in the T3SS2-positive V.
mimicus strains were sequenced and the nucleotide
sequences thus obtained were used for phylogenetic
analysis. In addition, we used the nucleotide sequences
of the three T3SS2 genes of the two V. parahaemolyticus strains RIMD2210633 and TH3996, and the four V.
cholerae strains, AM-19226, 1587 and 623-39, as well as
V51, identified to date. Phylogenetic trees for each of
the genes were constructed with the Neighbor-Joining
(NJ) method.
The analysis demonstrated that the PCR products of
the T3SS2 genes in V. mimicus strains RIMD2218022,
2218042, 2218069, 2218070, 2218080, 2218081, 2218082
and 2218083 belong to the cluster containing the
T3SS2a genes of V. parahaemolyticus strain
RIMD2210633 and that of V. cholerae strains AM19226 and V51 (Figure 1). In contrast, the amplicons
obtained from the T3SS2 genes in the V. mimicus strain
RIMD2218067 were found to be closely related to the
T3SS2b genes in the V. parahaemolyticus TH3996 strain
and V. cholerae strains 1587 and 623-39 (Figure 1).
These findings confirmed that, similar to the findings
for V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae strains, the
T3SS2 of V. mimicus strains could be classified into two
phylogroups, T3SS2a and T3SS2b.

Presence and absence of the genes in VPI-2 and Vp-PAI

Both the T3SS2 gene cluster of V. parahaemolyticus and
the T3SS gene cluster of V. cholerae can be found on
PAIs [7,19,20]. In V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 strains
AM-19226, NRT36S, V51, 1587 and 623-39, the PAI
(VPI-2) contains the genes for sialic acid metabolism in
addition to the genes for T3SS (Figure 2) [19]. In V.
parahaemolyticus strains RIMD2210633 and TH3996,

on the other hand, the homologues for sialic acid
metabolism were not found in the Vp-PAI (Figure 2).
The gene compositions of the PAI cassettes in V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae, except for the T3SS gene
cluster, were thus clearly distinct. To compare the gene
organization of the PAI of V. mimicus with that of the
PAIs of V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae, we used
additional PCR assays to determine the presence or

absence of open reading frames (ORFs), which occur
only in the Vp-PAI of V. parahaemolyticus or the VPI-2
of V. cholerae, in T3SS2-positive V. mimicus strains.
The ORFs on the PAIs of V. parahaemolyticus and V.
cholerae strains, except for the T3SS2 genes, could be
amplified with the primer sets that were designed by
using the ORF sequences on the Vp-PAI in V. parahaemolyticus strains RIMD2210633 and TH3996 and those
on VPI-2 in V. cholerae strains AM-19226 and 1587 as
templates against the genomic DNA of nine V. mimicus

T3SS2-positive strains (see Additional file 4, 5, 6, 7).
Some of the ORFs on the Vp-PAI of V. parahaemolyticus strains, could be amplified in the V. mimicus strains
tested, but most could not (see Additional file 4, 5, 6, 7,
Figure 2). In contrast, most of the non-T3SS ORFs on
VPI-2 of V. cholerae could be amplified in the T3SSpositive, but not in the T3SS2-negative V. mimicus
strains (data not shown).
These findings suggest that the composition of the
V. mimicus PAIs containing the T3SS genes, if present,

Okada et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:302
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/302

may be more closely related to that of V. cholerae VPI-2
than of V. parahaemolyticus Vp-PAI (Figure 2).
Cytotoxicity assay of mutant strains

Previous studies have demonstrated that T3SS2s of
V. parahaemolyticus RIMD2210633 and TH3996 as well
as V. cholerae AM-19226 contribute to the pathogenicity of these organisms [14,17,20,22-24]. To determine
the possible contribution of T3SS2 to the pathogenicity
of V. mimicus strains, we compared the cytotoxicity of
the wild-type and mutant strains for cultured cell lines.
T3SS-deficient mutants were constructed by disruption
of the homologue of the vscN2 gene, which encodes an
ATPase of T3SS2, in V. mimicus RIMD2218042 (a type)
and RIMD2218067 (b type) strains. To confirm the deletion of the vscN2 gene, PCR amplification using oligonucleotide primer pairs was performed (see Additional
file 1 and 8). The growth of the mutant strains in LB
medium (1% NaCl) was indistinguishable from that of
the parental strains (data not shown). Both V. mimicus
RIMD2218042 and RIMD2218067 strains were cytotoxic
for Caco-2 cells at 3 h post-infection. The cytotoxicity
of both the T3SS2a- and T3SS2b-deficient mutant
strains tended to decrease, but there were no significant
differences between T3SS2a- and T3SS2b-deficient
mutant strains and their parental strains (see Additional
file 9).

Discussion
A recent study of ours demonstrated that two lines of
distinct lineage of the T3SS2 gene cluster, T3SS2a and
T3SS2b, are present in the KP-positive and trh-positive
V. parahaemolyticus strains, respectively [20]. Although
a previously reported study using dot blot analysis could
not detect the genes for T3SS2 in 16 Vibrio species, the
probes and PCR primers used in previous studies were
designed based on the sequence information of
the T3SS2a genes in V. parahaemolyticus strain
RIMD2210633 [7,14]. Since the T3SS2b genes cannot be
detected by either PCR amplifications or comparative
genomic hybridization analysis targeting the T3SS2a
genes [7,15], we re-investigated the distribution of the
T3SS2 genes, both T3SS2a and T3SS2b, in Vibrio
species.
To examine the distribution of the genes for T3SS2 in
vibrios other than V. parahaemolyticus, we performed a
PCR assay using PCR primer pairs targeting both the
T3SS2a and T3SS2b genes. Of the 32 Vibrio species
tested, the T3SS2-related genes were detected in three
species, V. cholerae, which was previously reported, as
well as V. hollisae and V. mimicus.
In V. hollisae strains, only three genes for T3SS2a,
vscN2, vscR2, and vscT2, were detected. Nevertheless,
the fact that the PCR reactions for these three genes

Page 6 of 10

were positive in all the five V. hollisae strains tested is
intriguing. We speculate that the other genes for
T3SS2a might be absent in these particular V. hollisae
strains, or that the sequences of the other genes
included variations that would make PCR amplification
with the primer pairs used in this assay difficult. These
possibilities should be examined in the future by more
detailed genetic analyses, e.g. sequencing of the region
flanking the T3SS2-related genes.
A previous study showed that the T3SS2-related genes
are present in V. mimicus strains [25]. In our study, the
PCR assay also demonstrated the presence of the T3SS2
genes in V. mimicus strains. Of the 15 V. mimicus
strains tested in this study, 12 strains were isolated from
patients and three from the environment, with all
T3SS2-positive strains isolated from patients. There
were eight T3SS2a-positive and one T3SS2b-positive
strain among the T3SS2-positive V. mimicus strains.
The gene organization of the T3SS2 gene cluster in the
V. mimicus strains containing T3SS2a or T3SS2b, was
basically similar to that of the V. parahaemolyticus and
V. cholerae strains. Ours is thus the first study to
demonstrate that the two distinct types of T3SS2 gene
clusters, T3SS2a and T3SS2b, are present not only in V.
parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae but also in V. mimicus strains. Furthermore, we could show that the structures of the V. mimicus PAIs containing the T3SS genes
may be more closely related to those of V. cholerae VPI2 than of V. parahaemolyticus Vp-PAI (Figure 2). In
contrast, the ORFs in VPI-2 were not detected in any of
the T3SS-negative V. mimicus strains. This implies,
therefore, that the similar PAI cassettes containing the
T3SS2 gene cluster were acquired through horizontal
gene transfer in V. cholerae and V. mimicus (Figure 3).
The PCR primer pairs used in this study were found
to be useful for detecting as well as distinguishing the
genes for T3SS2a and T3SS2b in Vibrio species. In particular, the PCR assays targeting the three genes, vscN2,
vscR2 and vscT2, produced stable and reliable results for
detection of T3SS2-related genes. We therefore consider
that, for determining the presence or absence of these
genes, PCR amplification using the primer pairs for the
vscN2R2T2 genes of T3SS2a or T3SS2b is effective and
rapid. Although only a limited number of strains of the
non-human pathogenic Vibrio species was examined in
this study, more extensive studies of those species using
more strains may well reveal the presence of the T3SS2
genes in vibrios other than the ones reported here.
Previous studies showed that the T3SSs of V. parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae contribute to their pathogenicity for humans [14,17,20,22-24]. In V. mimicus, a
bacterium which is known to be a causative agent of
gastroenteritis in humans, the hemolysin was previously
reported as a major virulence factor [26]. To assess the

function of T3SS of V. mimicus in pathogenicity in our
study, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of V. mimicus for
Caco-2 cells because V. parahaemolyticus had a T3SS2dependent cytotoxic effect on Caco-2 cells [22]. The
results indicated that both T3SS2a-possessing and
T3SS2b-possessing V. mimicus strains showed the cytotoxic activity on Caco-2 cells in this assay. Although we
could not detect statistically significant differences
between T3SS-deficient mutants and parental strains,
there was a tendency for the cytotoxicity of T3SS-deficient mutants to diminish than that of the parental
mutants. A previous report showed that the deletion of
the hemolysin gene in V. mimicus significantly reduced
fluid accumulation in rabbit ileal loop tests, but the
mutant partially retained this action, which suggests
that, besides the hemolysin, V. mimicus may contain an
additional virulence determinant(s) [26]. It is therefore
possible that T3SS is a candidate for the previously unidentified virulence determinant in pathogenic V. mimicus strains for humans. The observed ambiguous
differences in cytotoxicity between the mutants and the
parental strains may be due to insufficient expression of
T3SS of V. mimicus under the culturing conditions used
in this study, because it is still unclear what the optimal

conditions are for inducing T3SS of V. mimicus. This
possibility needs to be examined in future studies.

Conclusions
This study demonstrated the presence of the gene cluster for T3SS2a or T3SS2b in V. mimicus, a bacterium
which is known to be a causative agent of gastroenteritis
in humans. Since it was reported that the T3SSs of V.
parahaemolyticus and V. cholerae contribute to their
pathogenicity for humans, the T3SS in V. mimicus identified in this study also might be a candidate virulence
factor of this organism for humans. This possibility
needs to be examined in future studies.
Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions

All the Vibrio species strains were obtained from the
Pathogenic Microbes Repository Unit, International
Research Center for Infectious Diseases, Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University. The culture temperatures were 15°C for V. logei and V.
salmonicida and 10°C for V. wondanis, while all other
bacteria were cultured at 25°C. The bacteria were grown
with shaking in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (tryptone, 1%;

yeast extract, 0.5%) with 3% NaCl for V. parahemolyticus
and in Difco marine broth 2216 for V. nigripulchritudo,
V. pectenicida and V. halioticoli. Other bacteria were
grown in LB broth with 1% NaCl.
Oligonucleotide primers and PCR conditions

Additional file 1 shows the oligonucleotide primers used
in this study. Chromosomal DNA from Vibrio species
strains was extracted for PCR as previously described
[20]. For detection of the presence of the T3SS2 genes in
related Vibrio species, PCR using the EX-PCR Kit
(Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan) was performed. The PCR
conditions were as follows: after initial denaturation at
94°C for 3 min, a cycle of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s,
and 72°C for 30 s, 45 s, 1 min or 1.5 min was repeated 30
times. PCR scanning of the V. mimicus was performed
using genomic DNA as a template and with a long accurate (LA) PCR kit (Takara Shuzo) as previously described
[20]. Custom-synthesized oligonucleotides for the PCR
were purchased from GeneDesign (Osaka, Japan).

Cytotoxicity assays

For cytotoxicity assays, eukaryotic cells were seeded at 3 ×
104 cells well-1 in 96-well plates and cultured for 48 h to
confluency. The cells were co-cultured with PBS-washed
bacteria at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 10 for 2- 6 h.
The release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) into the medium was quantified by using a CytoTox96 non-radioactive
cytotoxicity kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The LDH release (per cent cytotoxicity) was
calculated with the following equation: [optical density at
492 nm (OD492) of experimental release - OD492 of spontaneous release]/(OD492 of maximum release - OD492 of
spontaneous release) × 100. Spontaneous release is defined
as the amount of LDH released from the cytoplasm of
uninfected cells, and maximum release as the total amount
of LDH released after the complete lysis of uninfected cells.
Statistical analysis

Statistical significance was determined with the t test. A
P value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

DNA sequencing and informatic analysis

Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

To sequence the DNA fragments amplified by PCR, the
fragments were purified with the PCR Gel Extraction
Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA sequencing was performed with
the ABI PRISM 3130 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA) and the BigDye v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied
Biosystems). The Genetyx sequence analysis program
(Software Development, Tokyo, Japan) was used for
computer analysis of DNA sequences. Homology
searches against deposited sequences were performed
with the aid of data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) using the BLAST network service http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and the
BLAST service at the Genome Information Research
Center http://genome.naist.jp/bacteria/vpara/. Sequence
information was obtained from the NCBI. The computer
program CLUSTAL W was used for the nucleotide
sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis.

The nucleotide sequence data reported in this paper will
appear in the DDBJ, EMBL, and GenBank nucleotide
sequence database under accession numbers AB560976,

Construction of vscN2 deletion mutant strains of V.
mimicus

A four-primer PCR technique was used to engineer an
in-frame deletion mutation as described previously [14].
Briefly, the upstream and downstream sequences of
vscN2 of T3SS2a or T3SS2b were amplified using the
pairs listed in Additional file 1. The two fragments,
amplified with primers 1 and 3, and 2 and 4, respectively,
were used as templates for a second PCR using primers 1
and 4, which generated a PCR product containing the
desired deletion. The amplified fragments were then
sequenced and subcloned into an R6K-ori suicide vector
pYAK1 and transformed into E. coli SM10lpir.
