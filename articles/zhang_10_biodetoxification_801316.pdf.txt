Biodetoxification of toxins generated from
lignocellulose pretreatment using a newly
isolated fungus, Amorphotheca resinae ZN1, and
the consequent ethanol fermentation
Jian Zhang†, Zhinan Zhu†, Xiaofeng Wang, Nan Wang, Wei Wang, Jie Bao*

Abstract
Background: Degradation of the toxic compounds generated in the harsh pretreatment of lignocellulose is an
inevitable step in reducing the toxin level for conducting practical enzymatic hydrolysis and ethanol fermentation
processes. Various detoxification methods have been tried and many negative outcomes were found using these
methods, such as the massive freshwater usage and wastewater generation, loss of the fine lignocellulose particles
and fermentative sugars and incomplete removal of inhibitors. An alternate method, biodetoxification, which
degrades the toxins as part of their normal metabolism, was considered a promising option for the removal of
toxins without causing the above problems.
Results: A kerosene fungus strain, Amorphotheca resinae ZN1, was isolated from the microbial community growing
on the pretreated corn stover material. The degradation of the toxins as well as the lignocelluloses-derived sugars
was characterized in different ways, and the results show that A. resinae ZN1 utilized each of these toxins and
sugars as the sole carbon sources efficiently and grew quickly on the toxins. It was found that the solid-state
culture of A. resinae ZN1 on various pretreated lignocellulose feedstocks such as corn stover, wheat straw, rice
straw, cotton stalk and rape straw degraded all kinds of toxins quickly and efficiently. The consequent simultaneous
saccharification and ethanol fermentation was performed at the 30% (wt/wt) solid loading of the detoxified
lignocellulosic feedstocks without a sterilization step, and the ethanol titer in the fermentation broth reached
above 40 g/L using food crop residues as feedstocks.
Conclusions: The advantages of the present biodetoxification by A. resinae ZN1 over the known detoxification
methods include zero energy input, zero wastewater generation, complete toxin degradation, processing on solid
pretreated material, no need for sterilization and a wide lignocellulose feedstock spectrum. These advantages make
it possible for industrial applications with fast and efficient biodetoxification to remove toxins generated during
intensive lignocellulose pretreatment.

Background
Pretreatment is a requisite step in overcoming the biocalcitrance of lignocellulose and remains one of the
most expensive steps for cellulosic ethanol production
[1]. This harsh step generally involves strong chemical
or physicochemical conditions to break the lignocellulose structure and release monosaccharide sugars by

Science and Technology, 130 Meilong Road, Shanghai 200237, China

cellulase enzymes [2]. Various lignocellulose derived
toxins, including furan derivatives (furfural and 5-hydromethylfurfural (HMF)), organic acids (acetic acid, formic
acid, and ferulic acid) and lignin derivatives (vanillin,
4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, guaiacol, and phenol), are generated during pretreatment processing [3,4]. These toxins severely inhibit the consequent enzymatic hydrolysis
and ethanol fermentation [2,5]. Therefore, a detoxification step to remove the toxins for the consequent
hydrolysis and fermentation is unavoidable.

Various detoxification methods had been tried, such as
water washing, overliming, vaporization and ion
exchange absorption [3,6]. However, these methods
resulted in many negative outcomes, including massive
freshwater usage and wastewater generation, loss of the
fine lignocellulose particles and fermentative sugars and
incomplete removal of inhibitors [7]. Among the most
frequently used methods, water washing, considerable
pretreated lignocellulose solids were lost during the
washing and liquid-solid separation step, thus leading to
the loss of ethanol of at least the same percentage.
Furthermore, the considerable amount of water used led
to high cost of the downstream wastewater treatment.
Finally, the high water content in the pretreated feedstock led to the low ethanol titer in the consequent fermentation and then the high energy cost in the
distillation.
An alternate option for removing toxins without causing these problems is biodetoxification, which relies on
microorganisms to degrade the toxins as part of their
normal metabolism by secreting peroxidase or laccase
enzymes into the hydrolysate [8-11]. Biodetoxification
has many advantages, such as no loss of cellulose solids,
greatly decreased use of water, and thus high concentrations of solids for fermentation. However, the current
biodetoxification method applied only to the liquid
hydrolysate system, in which the cellulose was hydrolyzed under toxin inhibition to cellulase enzymes and
the toxin concentrations had been diluted; thus the
degradation rate was decreased. Furthermore, the
reduced sugars in the hydrolysate at high concentrations
might be consumed. The slow biodegradation rate of
toxins significantly limited its practical applications. No
fermentation practice was carried out using the detoxified materials as the feedstock for ethanol production.
In this study, a unique fungal microorganism was isolated from the natural habitat environment on the pretreated lignocellulose material, which grew faster than
other microorganisms on the pretreated corn stover
material. After several rounds of screening, the biodegradation strain was selected and identified as the Amorphotheca resinae fungus, a species of kerosene strains,
and then named A. resinae ZN1. The inhibitor removal
of A. resinae ZN1 was tested, and it was proven that A.
resinae ZN1 adapted to the pretreated lignocellulosesbased environment perfectly, grew quickly using the sole
inhibitor as the carbon source and preserved the cellulose component well. Besides, in contrast to the previous
methods, the detoxification in this work was carried out
by the solid-state fermentation on the pretreated lignocellulose materials, thus directly degrading the toxins at
its high concentrations. The detoxification using A. resinae ZN1 was applied both on the steam explosion and
on dilute acid-pretreated corn stover, and then the

Page 2 of 15

detoxified corn stover was used for simultaneous saccharification and ethanol fermentation. The detoxification method was applied to various lignocellulose
feedstocks and was found to work perfectly. The detoxification strain and the method used in this work provided an effective detoxification method for the
utilization of lignocellulose for bioethanol production
with higher industrial application potential than previously used methods.

Methods
Raw materials and pretreatment

Corn stover (CS) was grown in Jilin, China, and harvested in fall 2007. Rice straw and cotton stalk were
grown in Hubei, China, and harvested in 2008. Wheat
straw and rape straw were grown in Henan, China, and
harvested in 2008. After collection, the materials were
milled coarsely on a beater pulverizer (SF-300; Ketai
Milling Equipment, Shanghai, China) and screened
through mesh with a circle diameter of 10 mm. The
milled raw materials were washed to remove the field
dirt, stones and metals; dried; and then stored in sealed
plastic bags for use.
The steam explosion pretreatment was performed on
CS only. The milled CS materials were steam heated to
210°C, 2.2 MPa, for 4 minutes, then the pressure was
released quickly [12]. Only saturated steam was used,
and no chemicals were added. The pretreated CS contained approximately 50% dry solid matter (DM) and
was stored at 4°C for use.
The dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment was performed
on all the materials, including CS, rice straw, wheat
straw, rape straw and cotton stalk. The pretreatment
reactor was a self-made stainless cylinder with the working volume of 10 L, and 800 g of each feedstock material were filled in each operation. The feedstock was
presoaked with diluted sulfuric acid solution with the
solid (dry material) to liquid (5.0% (wt/wt) sulfuric acid
solution) ratio of 2:1 (wt/wt). The presoaked wet materials were fed into the reactor, and the hot steam was
jetted directly into the reactor to 190°C, 1.2 MPa, for 3
minutes. All the sulfuric acid solution and the steamcondensed water were absorbed into the solid material
to give a DM content of 50% (wt/wt). No free water was
generated during the pretreatment. The pretreated
materials were released from the reactor and stored at
4°C. The most frequently used pretreatment method in
this work is the dilute sulfuric acid method unless mentioned otherwise.
Enzymes and ethanol fermentation strain

The cellulase enzyme used was Accellerase 1000 from
Genencor International (Rochester, NY, USA). The filter
paper activity and the cellobiase activity were determined

Zhang et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels 2010, 3:26
http://www.biotechnologyforbiofuels.com/content/3/1/26

to be 65.8 FPU/ml and 152.0 IU/ml, respectively. One
unit of filter paper cellulase (FPU) was defined as the
amount of enzyme which produces 2.0 mg of reducing
sugar from 50.0 mg of filter paper within 1 h. The
detailed procedures for determination of cellulase and
cellobiase activities were described in Zhang et al. [13].
A thermo-and inhibitor-tolerant mutant strain Saccharomyces cerevisiae DQ1 was used for ethanol fermentation. The culture solution was aliquoted into 1mL vials containing 30% (wt/wt) glycerol and stored in
a -80°C. A vial of S. cerevisiae DQ1 was taken from the
-80°C freezer and directly inoculated in the seeding culture for the purpose of keeping all the seeding strains
the same. The adaptation procedure of the strain S. cerevisiae DQ1 was described in detail by Zhang et al. [13].
Isolation of detoxification strains

The steam explosion-pretreated CS samples were
exposed to ambient air for 2 weeks and stored at 4°C in
a refrigerator for months after being transported from
the cold northeast China region to the warm southern
Shanghai area. The original detoxification strains were
isolated using a three-step screening procedure as
described in the next three subsections.
Strain isolation

Ten grams of the pretreated CS samples were diluted
with 90 ml of sterilized water and incubated for 2 h at
30°C and 180 rpm to obtain the 1 × 10-1 suspension. The
suspension was further diluted into 10-2, 10-3 and 10-4
suspensions. The 10 -4 dilution was streaked onto the
potato-dextrose-agar (PDA) plates containing 200 g/L
potato extract juice, 20 g/L glucose and 20 g/L agar for
enrichment culture. The plates were incubated for 5 days
at 25°C, and the colonies were restreaked onto the PDA
plates on the basis of the morphology and color of the
colonies. Then the single colony was isolated, and each
colony was restreaked for five generations to obtain the
purified single colony.
Initial screening

The screening medium was prepared by adding the
toxic compounds of 6.0 g/L acetic acid, 1.0 g/L furfural,
and 1.5 g/L HMF into the PDA medium. The isolated
colonies were streaked onto the screening medium and
incubated for 5 days at 25°C. Then the toxin tolerant
strains were selected from the PDA medium containing
toxins.
Detoxification screening

The selected colonies were further quantitatively
screened by their toxin degradation abilities on the
steam explosion-pretreated CS samples. Ten grams of
the pretreated CS were inoculated with 1 ml of diluted
suspension (about 1 × 106 spores/mL) and incubated in
the 250-mL flasks at 25°C for 4 days. A quantity of
44 ml of the citrate acid buffer (100 mM, pH 4.8) and

Page 3 of 15

1.25 ml of Accellerase 1000 (15.0 FPU/g DM) were
added to the flasks to reach solid loading of 10%
(wt/wt). The enzymatic hydrolysis lasted for 12 h at
50°C and 150 rpm in a water bath shaking incubator.
The steam explosion-pretreated CS without strain
inoculation was used as the control. The initially
selected strains with better inhibitor-degrading performance were selected for further experimentation.
Molecular identification of the detoxification strain

The selected strains were cultured in the PDA medium,
and 8 mg of the dry mycelia were collected. The genomic
DNA was extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Tissue Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and purified following the
“Yeast Genomic DNA Purification Protocol” discussed in
the attached handbook. The 18 S rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence was amplified by the universal primers ITS1 (5’-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG3’) and ITS4 (5’-TCCTCCGCTTAGATATGC-3’). The
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were purified
using the PCR Purification Mini Kit (Omega Biotek, Norcross, GA) and sequenced by Shanghai Biotech Service
(Shanghai, China). The ITS sequences were blasted in the
National Center for Biotechnology Information database
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, and the phylogenetic trees
were constructed using Bioedit 7.0 http://www.mbio.
ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.html and Mega 4 software
http://www.megasoftware.net/ using the neighbor-joining
method.
Growth assay of isolates on pretreated CS material

The growth performance under different pH and temperature conditions was assayed by counting the colony
numbers. One milliliter of the selected strain (1 × 106
spores) suspension was inoculated onto 10 g of the pretreated CS and incubated for 3 days at 25°C. The CS
was washed with 90 ml of sterilized water, shaken for
2 hours at 25°C and 180 rpm and then diluted to 10-3
or 10-4 fold. A quantity of 0.1 ml of the suspension was
taken, spread onto the PDA plates and incubated for
4 days at 25°C. Then the colony numbers on PDA plates
were counted. The growth assay under different oxygen
levels was operated using two flasks, one filled with
nitrogen and sealed with a rubber stopper and the other
covered only with a cotton stopper.
Growth assays of isolates using toxins as the sole carbon
sources

The detoxification performance of the isolates using the
inhibitor substances as the sole carbon sources was
assayed by observation of the mycelia growth on the
pretreated CS solids. The dilute sulfuric acid-pretreated
CS was thoroughly washed with deionized water until
no inhibitor substances from the washout solution were

Zhang et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels 2010, 3:26

found on performing high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Three grams of such thoroughly
washed, dried CS were mixed with various toxins (each
toxin was dissolved in 10 ml of sterilized water) and
used for the solid-state culture. Two milliliters of the
spore suspension (1 × 106 ml) were inoculated onto the
3 g of the mixed CS in 250-ml flasks and cultured for
9 days at 25°C. The mycelia formation in the flask was
observed periodically.
Detoxification assays of toxins by the isolates

The biodetoxification performance of the isolates was
assayed by mixing an extra amount of toxic inhibitor
substances onto the pretreated CS and then inoculated
with the spore suspension of the isolates. Five grams of
the pretreated CS were mixed with each of the inhibitor
substances, and then 8 ml of sterilized deionized water
was added. Next, 1 ml of the isolate suspension (1 ×
106 ) was inoculated onto the CS. The toxic inhibitors
supplemented included acetic acid, formic acid, levulinic
acid, furfural and HMF. First, the substances were
added separately, and then the toxin mixtures were
added. The culture was carried out for 5 days at 25°C,
then the cellulase enzyme was added for simultaneous
saccharification and ethanol fermentation (SSF) assay at
the conditions of 15.0 FPU/g DM, 10% (wt/wt) of the
detoxified CS solid loading, pH 4.8 (100 mM citrate buffer), 50°C and 150 rpm in the water bath shaking incubator for 12 h. Then S. cerevisiae DQ1 was added at a
10% (vol/vol) inoculation ratio for another 12 h at 37°C.
The samples were taken at 12-h intervals for HPLC analysis of toxins, glucose and ethanol.
SSF at high solids loading

Different lignocellulose materials, including CS, rice straw,
wheat straw, rape straw and cotton stalk were pretreated
using steam explosion or dilute acid methods and then
detoxified at 25°C for 3 days with the selected detoxification strain. The SSF at the solid loading of 30% (wt/wt, dry
base) was operated in a 5-L helical stirring bioreactor as
described by Zhang et al. [13]. In the prehydrolysis stage,
Accellerase 1000 was fed into the bioreactor at the dosage
of 15.0 FPU/g DM, followed by feeding of the detoxified
feedstocks into the bioreactor within 12 h at 50°C and
150 rpm. Then the temperature was reduced to 37°C, and
the S. cerevisiae DQ1 seeds were inoculated into the
hydrolysate at the ratio of 10% (vol/vol). pH was maintained at 5.0 using a 5 M NaOH solution and a 1 M
H2SO4 solution. The SSF operation continued for 60 h,
and the samples were withdrawn at regular intervals.
The procedure for the water-washing detoxification
was operated as follows. First, different amounts of tap
water were added to the pretreated CS and stirred for
1 h at 25°C. Then squeezed liquid out of the slurry until

Page 4 of 15

the solid content rose to 50% (wt/wt, dry base) by a
hydraulic press machine at 15 MPa (P-204; Dazhang
Filter Equipment, Shanghai, China) for SSF use.
Cellulose/hemicellulose measurement and yield
calculation

The contents of cellulose and hemicellulose were determined according to a two-step H 2 SO 4 hydrolysis
method put forth by the National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL) [14], with minor modifications. A
quantity of 100 mg of thoroughly washed and dried CS
were added with 1 ml of 72% (wt/wt) H2SO4, and the
mixture was stirred using a glass rod until the sample
was completely mixed with the acid solution. After incubation at 30°C for 1 h, the mixture was diluted by adding 28 ml of deionized water, and the diluted mixture
was hydrolyzed at 121°C for 1 h. The mixture was neutralized with CaCO 3 powder and then centrifuged at
10,000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant was used for
HPLC analysis.
The glucose yields were calculated according to NREL
LAP-009 [15] as follows:
Glucose yield = ([glucose] + 1.053 × [cellobiose])/
(1.111 × [fraction] × [biomass]) × 100%,
where [glucose] is the glucose concentration in the
broth after enzymatic hydrolysis, [cellobiose] is the cellobiose concentration in the broth after enzymatic hydrolysis, [biomass] is the dry biomass weight concentration at
the beginning of the enzymatic hydrolysis, [fraction] is
the cellulose fraction of the dry biomass (g/g), 1.053 is
the conversion factor for cellobiose to equivalent glucose
and 1.111 is the conversion factor for cellulose to equivalent glucose. The ethanol yields were calculated using the
method described by Zhang et al. [13].
Analysis of sugars, ethanol and inhibitors using HPLC

Glucose, ethanol and toxins such as furfural, HMF,
acetic acid, formic acid and levulinic acid were analyzed
using HPLC (LC-20AD, refractive index detector RID10A; Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with a Bio-Rad Aminex
HPX-87 H column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at the
column temperature of 65°C. The mobile phase was
5 mM H 2 SO 4 at the rate of 0.6 mL/min. All samples
were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and then filtered through a 0.22-μm filter before analysis.

Results
Screening and identification of the detoxification strains

In the isolation step, 14 colonies with different phenotypes were isolated from the air-exposed, pretreated CS
samples and were named ZN1 to ZN14, respectively.
Then all 14 strains were sent for further screening.
In the initial screening step, the total of 14 strains
was streaked onto the screening medium to select the

Zhang et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels 2010, 3:26
http://www.biotechnologyforbiofuels.com/content/3/1/26

toxin-tolerant strains. Since acetic acid, HMF and furfural were three major products during lignocellulose
pretreatment and the most toxic inhibitors to microbial growth [3,16], microbial growth behaviors on the
screening medium could be used as an index of toxin
tolerance. Table 1 shows that the growth performance
of the strains ZN1, ZN2 and ZN3 were significantly
better than the other 11 strains. Thus these three
strains were selected as the candidates in the next
round of detoxification screening. The morphology of
the colonies ZN1, ZN2 and ZN3 on the PDA plates
are shown in Figure 1.
In the detoxification screening step, the spore suspensions of the selected strains ZN1, ZN2 and ZN3 were
directly inoculated onto the steam explosion-pretreated
CS samples for 5 days in solid-state culture. The detoxified CS samples were enzymatically hydrolyzed at 50°C
for 12 h, and then the hydrolysate was analyzed to
check the toxin degradation and the glucose release.
The pretreated CS without inoculation of the selected
strains was used as the control. Table 2 shows that ZN1
degraded all three toxins most efficiently compared to
ZN2 and ZN3. The glucose yield after 12 h of hydrolysis
was increased by 53.7% using ZN1, while the glucose
yield using ZN2 and ZN3 increased by only 28.0% and
34.6%, respectively. Another finding was that ZN1 grew
faster than ZN2 and ZN3 and dominated the microbial
community at the end of the detoxification culture.
When ZN1, ZN2 and ZN3 were mixed equivalently
and inoculated on the pretreated CS material, only ZN1
survived after 1-day culture, while ZN2 and ZN3

diminished. Therefore, the strain ZN1 was chosen as the
most favorable candidate biodetoxification strain, both
for its best toxin degradation capacity and for growth
behaviors.
The ITS sequences of the three strains are shown in
Table 3. The result shows that ZN1 had 98% similarity
to Amorphotheca resinae AY251067.1 (also known as
Hormoconis resinae and Cladosporium resinae) and Cladosporium breviramosum AF393684.2. A. resinae was a
fungal strain known as “kerosene fungus” with a unique
property of degrading petroleum and kerosene [17].
ZN2 had 98% similarity to Penicillium polonicum
EU128628.1 [18], while ZN3 demonstrated 99% similarity to Eupenicillium baarnense AY213679 [19]. After
comparing the colonies’ morphology with that of related
species, constructing the phylogenetic trees and analyzing the sequence distances among the most related isolates, the three strains were designated as Amorphotheca
resinae ZN1, Penicillium polonicum ZN2 and Eupenicillium baarnense ZN3, respectively.
Phenotype characterization of A. resinae ZN1 on substrate
utilization

Two control experiments were carried out to characterize the growth behaviors of A. resinae ZN1. The first
control experiment was the effect of A. resinae ZN1 on
the cellulose content of the CS materials. The cellulose
contents of the fresh pretreated CS and the detoxified
CS after 4 days of solid-state culture of A. resinae ZN1
were determined to be 33.4 ± 1.4% (wt/wt) and 32.6 ±
1.1% (wt/wt), respectively, indicating that the cellulose
during the detoxification by A. resinae ZN1 was almost
untouched. The reason might be that no cellulase components were secreted out the cells of A. resinae ZN1 to
degrade cellulose in the pretreated CS. The second control experiment was the growth of A. resinae ZN1 on
the thoroughly washed, pretreated CS materials. The
result shows that no mycelia formation was observed
even 9 days after A. resinae ZN1 was inoculated. Therefore, the toxin degradation and growth assay experiments could be carried out with the thoroughly washed
pretreated CS as the substrate carrier by simply observing the mycelia formation without considering the cellulose degradation.
Table 4 shows the utilization behaviors of different lignocelluloses-derived sugars as the sole carbon sources
by A. resinae ZN1. The result shows that A. resinae
ZN1 could utilize all major lignocelluloses-derived
sugars as the sole carbon sources, including glucose,
xylose, mannose, arabinose and galactose. Particularly,
A. resinae ZN1 utilized the two most abundant lignocelluloses-derived sugars, glucose and xylose, as the sole
carbon sources quickly, while the capacity of utilizing
arabinose, mannose and galactose were relatively weak.

Figure 1 Morphology of the isolates with toxin degradation property. Culture conditions: 25°C for 5 days in the static incubator.

Tables 5, 6, 7 and 8 show the capacity of toxin utilization by A. resinae ZN1 as the sole carbon sources on
the thoroughly washed, pretreated CS. Table 5 shows
that A. resinae ZN1 grew well by utilizing the two major
growth inhibitors, furfural from xylose degradation and
HMF from glucose degradation, as the sole carbon
sources. Table 6 shows that A. resinae ZN1 utilized well
the major organic acids derived from lignocellulose as
the sole carbon sources, including acetic acid, formic
acid, ferulic acid and salicylic acid. Table 7 shows that
A. resinae ZN1 utilized well the major lignin derivatives
as the sole carbon sources in a wide concentration
range, such as vanillin, sesamol, 4-hydroxylbenzaldehyde, guaiacol and phenol. The concentrations of the
toxins used in Tables 5, 6 and 7 already well exceeded
the concentration range in the fresh pretreated CS
materials. For furfural, the concentration range was limited to less than 20 mg/g DM, indicating that furfural
might be the most toxic toxin for A. resinae ZN1
growth.
Table 8 shows that A. resinae ZN1 utilized well the
two hydrocarbon compounds, kerosene and dodecane (a
typical C12 alkane), as the sole carbon sources. The
result confirmed the unique and intrinsic property of A.
resinae species on hydrocarbon metabolism and provided the biological evidence of the strain identification,
besides the 18 S rDNA blasting result [17].

The above results indicate that the use of solid-state
culture on the pretreated CS solids by A. resinae ZN1
could be a reasonable option instead of submerged
liquid fermentation in the hydrolysate after hydrolysis of
the pretreated CS. The reasons include at least that (1)
higher toxin concentrations in the pretreated CS solids
accelerated toxin degradation compared to diluted toxin
concentrations in the hydrolysate slurry after the hydrolysis of the pretreated CS, (2) the sugar loss in the pretreated CS solids was reduced because of the very low
concentrations of the free monosaccharide sugars (especially glucose) in the pretreated CS solids compared to
that in the CS hydrolysate, (3) there was no observable
degradation of cellulose by the solid-state culture of A.
resinae ZN1 and (4) the toxin inhibition was alleviated
to the cellulase in subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis of
the pretreated CS after solid-state biodetoxification.

Figure 2 shows the growth behaviors of A. resinae ZN1
on the pretreated CS by measuring the colony numbers
formed during the solid-state culture. Figure 2a shows
that the growth temperature range of A. resinae was
between 20°C and 32°C, with the optimal range of
25-28°C, similar to most of the fungal strains. Figure 2b
shows that A. resinae grew well in a wide pH range with

an optimum of pH 4-6. The growth behaviors with different oxygen levels (data not shown) indicated that
A. resinae ZN1 grew well in both aeration conditions,
and, perhaps, the aerobic condition preferred its growth
slightly.
Figure 3 shows that the degradation performance of different single toxin supplemented onto the pretreated CS
solids by A. resinae ZN1. The detoxified CS was then used
for solid-state culture and SSF in flasks. Figure 3a shows
that at different acetic acid levels (2.0 g/L, 6.0 g/L and 8.0
g/L), the acetic acid concentrations in the detoxified CS
fermentation broth significantly decreased compared to
that found using nondetoxified CS. The glucose and ethanol yields also increased compared to the control. When
the acetic acid level reached 8.0 g/L, the detoxification by
A. resinae ZN1 became the inevitable step for ethanol fermentation: no ethanol formed in the control flask. Similarly, Figures 3b, 3c and 3d show that the formic acid,
furfural and HMF decreased, respectively, after the solid-

state detoxification of A. resinae ZN1 on the pretreated CS
and concomitantly the increase of glucose and ethanol
yields. At higher levels of the toxins, the biodetoxification
of A. resinae ZN1 showed its unique function for accelerating the SSF process rate.
Figure 4 shows the degradation of the mixed toxins
supplemented onto the pretreated CS solids by A. resinae ZN1. Figures 4a and 4b show the binary combination of acetic acid and furfural and of acetic acid and
5-HMF. Figure 4c shows the tertiary combination of
acetic acid, furfural and 5-HMF. The results show that
furfural was completely degraded prior to acetic acid
(Figure 4a) followed by HMF (Figure 4b). Figure 4c indicates that furfural degradation started first, HMF started
to be degraded after furfural was almost completely
degraded and acetic acid started to be degraded approximately after both furfural and HMF were completely
degraded. The ethanol titer increased with decreasing
toxin concentrations in all three cases.

SSF under high solid loading of biodetoxified CS

Figure 5 shows the SSF of the different pretreated CS
after biodetoxification by A. resinae ZN1 at solid loading
of 30% (wt/wt, dry base). Two feedstocks, the steam
explosion-pretreated and the dilute sulfuric acid-pretreated CS material, were detoxified using the solid-state
culture of A. resinae ZN1 for 4 days and then fed into
the helical stirring bioreactor for SSF. Figure 5a shows
that the glucose consumption and the ethanol production rates using the steam explosion-pretreated CS after
biodetoxification were greater than that using the fresh
pretreated CS within the first 48 h, although the final
ethanol concentrations reached the same level after 60-h
fermentation. The results indicated that the toxin
removal by biodetoxification lessened the toxin inhibition to the fermenting yeast to a large extent and thus
enhanced ethanol productivity. Figure 5b shows the SSF
using the dilute sulfuric acid CS after biodetoxification
was finished within 36 or 48 h, while the normal fermentation using the fresh dilute sulfuric acid-pretreated
CS did not occur. The result indicates that the solidstate detoxification of A. resinae ZN1 significantly
improved the SSF performance at high solid loading and

worked for different pretreated CS feedstocks. No
A. resinae ZN1 growth was found during the 60-h SSF
operation by spreading samples taken periodically on
the PDA plates, indicating that A. resinae ZN1 did not
survive in the anaerobic ethanol fermentation.
Figure 5c and Table 9 show comparisons between the
biodetoxification of A. resinae ZN1 and water washing
detoxification methods. Figure 5c shows that glucose
utilization and ethanol production using the biodetoxified CS were similar to that using water washing detoxification. The water washing method removed most of
the toxins; however, the water washing method resulted
in considerable loss of solids in addition to generating
massive sulfuric acid containing wastewater (Table 9). If
the solids loss in the water washing is considered, the
overall ethanol yield using the biodetoxified CS was
approximately 8% greater than the best result using the
water washing CS.

on different lignocellulose materials. Five lignocellulose
materials were collected, including three food crop residues, CS, wheat straw and rice straw, as well as two oil
and fiber crop residues, cotton stalk and rape straw. The
same mechanical milling, the dilute sulfuric acid pretreatment, the solid-state detoxification by A. resinae
ZN1 and the high solid loading SSF procedure were followed for all five feedstocks. No cell growth or ethanol
formation was detected in the SSF operation using the
fresh pretreated materials of all five lignocellulose feedstocks without biodetoxification, similar to the result in
Figure 5b with the nonbiodetoxified CS.
Figure 6a shows that the SSF performance for the
three food crop residues was similar, although the glucose utilization and the ethanol production rate showed
some minor differences, with the order of CS > wheat
straw > rice straw. Figure 6b shows that the performance of the two oil and fiber crop residues was relatively poorer compared to that of the food crop residues
with the lowered ethanol yield up to 20-30%, but still
worked for these residues. Perhaps the chemicals and
inherent structure of the food crop residues might be
different from the oil and fiber crop residues, and the
pretreatment and biodetoxification procedures for the
nonfood crop residues needed to be optimized on an
individual basis, while for food crop residues the procedures might be universal from pretreatment to biodetoxification and to SSF operation.

Discussion
Ethanol fermentation strains as well as cellulase
enzymes were severely inhibited by the toxic compounds
generated in the harsh pretreatment of lignocellulose.
Thus the efficient removal of the toxins is a requisite
step for the biological conversion using lignocellulose
feedstock. To avoid the drawbacks in routine detoxification, biodetoxification now is being considered as a promising method for toxin removal at mild conditions,
low energy input and zero wastewater release. Currently,
many bacteria and fungi were isolated and identified to
have toxin degradation capacity, but the ethanol fermentation practice using biodetoxified lignocellulose feedstocks has not been demonstrated.
In this study, the newly isolated A. resinae ZN1 from
the pretreated CS sample showed many advantages.
A. resinae ZN1 grew particularly fast and dominated the
microbial community during the detoxification culture
on the intensively pretreated lignocellulose material with
high concentration of inhibitors. This property lessened
the possibility of contamination by other microbial
organisms because of its fast growth advantage. A. resinae ZN1 was able to utilize all the known toxin inhibitors as the sole carbon sources for its growth and
showed a wide applicability to detoxification of various

Page 14 of 15

lignocellulose feedstocks. Also, no cellulose degradation
was observed during the A. resinae ZN1 culture on solid
CS, and thus the cellulose loss could be avoided in the
biodetoxification step. On the other hand, A. resinae
ZN1 diminishes spontaneously in the anaerobic
fermentation.
The solid-state culture model was applied for biodetoxification by A. resinae ZN1 on the solid pretreated
materials instead of performing biodetoxification in the
liquid hydrolysate. The solid-state culture fits the fungus
habitat with relatively sufficient oxygen supply compared
to the liquid fermentation in the hydrolysate. The conditions were also preferable for quick toxin degradation:
high toxin concentration, low sugar contents (xylose
was relatively high, but glucose formed was negligible),
no energy requirement and no wastewater generation.
In other words, the target inhibitors were in high concentrations and the unwanted sugars were low. This was
particularly important because this strain (and perhaps
most other strains) took up glucose better than inhibitor
substances, although it was able to take inhibitors as the
sole carbon sources. Finally, the solid-state culture of
biodetoxification proved to be a fast process: more than
half of toxins were degraded within 1-2 days, and 3-4
days could be long enough for performing the consequent SSF process normally.
The disadvantage of the current biodetoxification by
A. resinae ZN1 was its consumption of considerable
xylose contained in the pretreated feedstocks, although
it may be considered to be a partial solution for xylose
utilization. Also, the A. resinae ZN1 biodetoxification
rate was still slow compared to the best processing time,
which may be limited to 1 day.

Conclusions
In conclusion, biodetoxification by A. resinae ZN1 provided a fast and efficient biodetoxification method for
removing toxins generated during intensive lignocellulose pretreatment, and its advantages made it possible
for potential industrial application. The advantages over
the known biodetoxification include zero energy input,
zero wastewater generation, complete toxin degradation,
processing on solid pretreated material, no need for
sterilization and a wide lignocellulose feedstock spectrum. Mechanisms such as metabolites and pathways
responsible for detoxification are under investigation.
The genome sequencing of A. resinae ZN1 is on the
way, and bioinformation knowledge is expected to be
used for metabolism pathway elucidation and genetic
modification.
