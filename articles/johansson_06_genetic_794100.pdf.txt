Abstract
Background: Clostridium perfringens, a serious pathogen, causes enteric diseases in domestic
animals and food poisoning in humans. The epidemiological relationship between C. perfringens
isolates from the same source has previously been investigated chiefly by pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis (PFGE). In this study the genetic diversity of C. perfringens isolated from various
animals, from food poisoning outbreaks and from sludge was investigated.
Results: We used PFGE to examine the genetic diversity of 95 C. perfringens type A isolates from
eight different sources. The isolates were also examined for the presence of the beta2 toxin gene
(cpb2) and the enterotoxin gene (cpe). The cpb2 gene from the 28 cpb2-positive isolates was also
partially sequenced (519 bp, corresponding to positions 188 to 706 in the consensus cpb2
sequence). The results of PFGE revealed a wide genetic diversity among the C. perfringens type A
isolates. The genetic relatedness of the isolates ranged from 58 to 100% and 56 distinct PFGE types
were identified. Almost all clusters with similar patterns comprised isolates with a known
epidemiological correlation.
Most of the isolates from pig, horse and sheep carried the cpb2 gene. All isolates originating from
food poisoning outbreaks carried the cpe gene and three of these also carried cpb2. Two
evolutionary different populations were identified by sequence analysis of the partially sequenced
cpb2 genes from our study and cpb2 sequences previously deposited in GenBank.
Conclusion: As revealed by PFGE, there was a wide genetic diversity among C. perfringens isolates
from different sources. Epidemiologically related isolates showed a high genetic similarity, as
expected, while isolates with no obvious epidemiological relationship expressed a lesser degree of
genetic similarity. The wide diversity revealed by PFGE was not reflected in the 16S rRNA
sequences, which had a considerable degree of sequence similarity. Sequence comparison of the
partially sequenced cpb2 gene revealed two genetically different populations. This is to our
knowledge the first study in which the genetic diversity of C. perfringens isolates both from different
animals species, from food poisoning outbreaks and from sludge has been investigated.

Background
Clostridium perfringens, an anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium known to be a common pathogen in humans, in
domestic animals and in wildlife, is the primary cause of
clostridial enteric disease in domestic animals. The complete genome sequence of C. perfringens has been published previously [1]. C. perfringens has 10 rRNA operons
whose heterogeneity was investigated by Shimizu et al.
[2]. They found 18 polymorphic sites among the 16S
rRNA genes. A common feature of C. perfringens is the
large number of exotoxins produced; 17 different exotoxins have been described in the literature [3]. In addition,
C. perfringens produces an enterotoxin, CPE [4].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/47

The purpose of this study was to compare the genetic relationships of C. perfringens type A from eight different
sources by PFGE. A further aim was to investigate the distribution of the cpb2 and cpe genes. The cpb2 gene from all
cpb2-positive isolates was also partially sequenced. In this
study a generally wide genetic diversity of C. perfringens
isolates from eight different sources was found. Furthermore, PFGE clearly distinguished between unrelated isolates of C.perfringens and supported a clonal relationship
between related isolates. Sequence analysis of the partially
sequenced cpb2 gene revealed two genetically different
populations of the gene.

Results
Clostridium perfringens is subdivided into five toxinotypes
(A – E) based on the production of the four major exotoxins (viz. alpha, beta, epsilon, and iota). The major toxins
together with the enterotoxin and the beta2 toxin [5], play
an important role in several serious diseases [3,6]. CPE
causes food-borne disease in humans, canine enteritis and
porcine enteritis. Beta2 toxin, recently described [5], has
been associated with enteric diseases in domestic animals,
especially piglets [7-9] and horses [10]. However, two
recently published studies, by Jost et al. [11] and Vilei et al.
[12], demonstrated that beta2 toxin, encoded by cpb2, was
expressed by most porcine C. perfringens isolates, but seldom by isolates of non-porcine origin. The results of those
studies indicate that beta2 toxin does not cause enteritis in
animal species other than pigs. Vilei et al. [12] reported
that gentamicin and streptomycin induced expression of
an atypical cpb2 gene in a non-porcine isolate. In a recent
publication by Waters et al. [13], it was reported that cpb2
of C. perfringens from horses was transcriptionally active
and that the levels of cpb2 mRNA were 35-fold lower than
a high beta2 toxin producing pig isolate. Isolates originating from humans with gastrointestinal diseases carrying
both cpb2 and cpe have recently been described [14,15].
The epidemiological relationship between C. perfringens
isolates has previously been investigated primarily by
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and in most of
these studies a majority of isolates from food poisoning
outbreaks were examined [16-21]. C. perfringens isolates
originating from poultry have also been investigated previously by PFGE [22-24]. The general conclusions drawn
from the previously published articles, concerning both
food poisoning outbreaks and animals, is that isolates
from the same outbreak have very similar patterns while
the genetic diversity is high in non-outbreak isolates and
isolates selected randomly [17-19,21-24]. The problem of
DNA degradation of certain isolates due to endogenous
bacterial nucleases, which are rather common among
clostridial isolates, has been discussed elsewhere
[16,18,25,26].

PCR
Multiplex PCR detected only the alpha-toxin gene (plc)
and all isolates were therefore classified as C. perfringens
type A. Altogether 28 isolates carried the cpb2 gene and 17
carried the cpe gene (# 1). The cpb2 gene was found in 6 of
the 8 groups studied: pigs (83%), horses (60%), sheep
(50%), food poisoning outbreaks (20%), sludge (21%)
and poultry (10%). The cpb2 gene was not detected in any
of the isolates from roedeer or wild birds. The cpe gene was
found in all isolates originating from food poisoning outbreaks and in one isolate each from horse and roedeer.
Both cpb2 and cpe were found in three isolates originating
from outbreaks of food poisoning.
PFGE
Of the 101 isolates of C. perfringens examined in this
study, 88 were successfully characterized by PFGE after
genomic DNA digestion with SmaI (Table 1, Figure 1). The
SmaI PFGE patterns of some of these isolates are shown in
Figure 2. The genetic relatedness of the isolates ranged
from 57 to 100% and 56 distinct PFGE profiles were
observed. Cluster analysis of PFGE data showed no apparent relationship between the source of the isolate and its
PFGE profile. However, the isolates originating from food
poisoning outbreak formed distinct clusters in the dendrogram (Figure 1). Altogether, 17 PFGE profiles with
indistinguishable patterns were found. Most of the isolates having PFGE profiles with indistinguishable patterns
were from the same outbreak of disease. All of the eight
food isolates clustering with indistinguishable patterns
originated from the same outbreak of food poisoning. The
poultry and porcine isolates clustering with indistinguishable patterns were also isolated from the same outbreaks.
Two of the PFGE profiles with indistinguishable patterns
contained isolates with no obvious epidemiological correlation. Of the 28 cpb2-positive isolates, 22 were successfully characterized by PFGE. The SmaI PFGE patterns of
these isolates are shown in Figure 3. The overall genetic
relatedness of the cpb2-positive isolates was 63%. All the
10 isolates originating from pigs cluster together with a
genetic relatedness of 72%. This cluster was subdivided

Sequence data analysis
In the phylogenetic tree (Figure 4) two main groups of the
partially sequenced cpb2 gene (the distance matrix comprised 425 nucleotide positions, corresponding to positions 282 to 706 in the consensus cpb2 sequence) were

observed, I and II, each subdivided to three subclusters, a,
b, c. A total of six groups could be identified (Figure 4,
Table 2). Groups I and II are mutually related, with a
sequence similarity of 73.8%. All isolates in our study
were found in group I. The sequence similarities within
this group varied between 93.3% and 100%. Our cpb2
sequences from porcine (Ia) and from non-porcine (Ib)
cluster with the cpb2 sequences deposited by Vilei et al

isolate AN 5036/01 was found in group Ic. Most of the
isolates in group II were isolated in the USA, while most
of those in group I were isolated in Europe.
Sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed a very high
similarity among the 11 isolates analysed. As shown in
Table 3, altogether 18 polymorphic sites were detected in
the 16S rRNA region between nucleotide no. 91 and 1401

(based on the consensus sequence of the 16S rRNA gene
in the 10 rRNA operons of C. perfringens strain 13, rrnA –
rrnI). Seven of the polymorphisms found in our isolates
were also found in C. perfringens strain 13 [2]. At position
154 of the 16S rRNA genes, one nucleotide difference was
observed; at this position, isolates from food poisoning
outbreaks (AN 4279/01 455/99) had a T, whereas all others had a C. This was the only nucleotide difference

Discussion
Prevalence of the cpb2 and cpe genes
The high prevalence of the cpb2 gene in isolates from pigs
and horses is consistent with other studies reporting a
high prevalence of cpb2 in pigs and horses suffering from
gastrointestinal diseases [7-10]. The distribution of cpe in
isolates of animal origin is low, which also tallies with
data from other studies [27-29]. Isolates from food poisoning outbreaks typically carry a chromosomal cpe gene
[21,30,31]; in this study three of these isolates also carried
the cpb2 gene. In this study three of the isolates from food
poisoning outbreaks also carried the cpb2 gene. Isolates
originating from humans with gastrointestinal diseases,
carrying both cpb2 and cpe, have been described recently
[14,15].
PFGE analysis
The aim of this study was to elucidate the general genetic
diversity of C. perfringens type A isolated from a variety of
sources in Sweden and Norway. In the present study, any

band difference between two PFGE types was considered
sufficient to distinguish between two different PFGE
types. The results obtained by PFGE reveal a wide genetic
diversity and no definite relationship between the source
of the isolate and the positions in the dendrogram can be
established.
The wide genetic diversity revealed in this study was not
unexpected, because of the wide diversity of the isolates
analysed. Previous studies on C. perfringens by PFGE have
shown that isolates from the same food poisoning outbreak have a very similar pattern [18-20] and that C. perfringens isolated from retail food showed a high genetic
variation [17]. This has also been observed in poultry
where isolates from diseased birds showed a similar pattern, whereas the genetic diversity was considerable in isolates from healthy birds [22-24]. Those observations are
consistent with our results, where we can see that PFGE
profiles with indistinguishable patterns in almost all cases
contain isolates having a known epidemiological connection. Comparison of the PFGE patterns of the cpb2-positive isolates revealed a clonal relationship among the
porcine isolates (group Ia), which cluster together in the

enterica subsp. enterica serotype Braenderup, (Salmonella
Braenderup H9812), digested with XbaI as a size marker
made it easier to normalize tiff images, than by using a

could be established for isolates belonging to groups Ib
and Ic. The cpb2 gene is known to be located on several
low copy number plasmids [5,15]. The genetic diversity of
cpb2-positive isolates is therefore, not surprising, as PFGE
mainly reflects the chromosomal diversity.

Sequence analysis of the cpb2 gene (Figure 4) indicated
the existence of two evolutionary differing populations
based on 425 nucleotide positions, corresponding to
positions 282 to 706 in the consensus cpb2 sequence. A
relatively high sequence difference of 26.2% showed that
cpb2 evolved into two different variants (I and II). The isolates sequenced in this study all belonged to group I and
were divided into three sub-clusters: porcine isolates (Ia),
animal isolates of non-porcine origin (Ib), and isolates
from food poisoning outbreaks (Ic). One of the horse isolates AN 5036/01 clustered together with the food isolates. Most of the group I cpb2-positive isolates were of
European origin [12], while most cpb2-positive isolates
from group II had an American origin [11]. However, isolates containing cpb2 isolated from humans with a gastrointestinal disease were distributed in both groups (Ic
and IIa), irrespective of origin [15]. Groups I and II both
contained isolates capable of expressing CPB2 and also
isolates that express non-detectable levels of beta2 toxin

In this study 13% of the isolates were non-typable due to
DNA degradation. This problem has been reported previously [16,18,32]. It is a disadvantage when PFGE is used
as a subtyping method for clostridial species. However,
problems with DNA degradation have not been reported
previously when analysing poultry isolates by PFGE [2224]. As in this study none of the isolates from poultry,
horses or pigs were found degraded, PFGE is a very suitable method for epidemiological investigation of enteric
diseases caused by C. perfringens. The 16S rRNA gene was
sequenced for three of the isolates that were found
degraded. Neither DNA degradation nor the generally
wide genetic diversity was reflected in the 16S rRNA

[11,12,15]. Jost et al. [11] identified a cpb2 gene that was
present in most non-porcine isolates. The cpb2 sequences
deposited by Jost et al. [11] were all affiliated to group II
(IIa, IIb or IIc). Isolates from European animals carrying
the cpb2 gene were all affiliated to group I. It is interesting
that none of the cpb2-positive isolates from animals in
Europe carried the cpb2 gene, which are found in group II.
Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene
The reason for sequencing the 16S rRNA gene was to
ascertain whether the diversity found by PFGE analysis
was reflected in the 16S rRNA gene. Isolates that were
degraded and those found in different clusters in the PFGE
dendrogram showed a very high sequence similarity.
However, we found 18 positions with polymorphisms
among our investigated isolates (Table 3). These polymorphisms are caused by the fact that C. perfringens carries 10
rRNA operons and sequence differences exist between
them. Some of these polymorphisms were isolate specific.
Seven of those found by us were also found by Shimizu et
al. [2] who analysed all the 10 rRNA operons of C. perfringens strain 13. The polymorphisms found in the C. perfringens 16S rRNA genes reflect certain diversity. In a few other
bacterial species polymorphisms have been used for subtyping [34], but due to the 10 rRNA operons in C. perfringens, it is more difficult to use the polymorphism pattern
for subtyping.

Conclusion
In this study a wide genetic diversity of C. perfringens was
found when isolates from eight different sources were
analysed by PFGE. Degradation of DNA was observed in
13% of the isolates investigated. The considerable diversity found by PFGE was not reflected in the 16S rRNA
sequences, which were very similar. As expected, C. perfringens isolates from the same outbreak seemed to be similar genetically, while isolates with no obvious
epidemiological connection differed more noticeably.
The groups with the highest genetic relatedness were isolates from food-borne outbreaks and pig isolates carrying
the cpb2 gene. Isolates from the other sources were more
widely dispersed in the dendrogram. Two genetically differing populations of the partially sequenced cpb2 gene
were found by sequence analysis. Furthermore, isolates
causing enteric diseases in humans and other animals
seem not to have a strong genetic relatedness, based on
PFGE analysis. We conclude that PFGE is a reliable and
robust method for genotyping of C. perfringens isolates.

Methods
Bacterial isolates and growth conditions
Altogether 95 isolates of C. perfringens type A were
obtained from eight different sources: poultry (n = 20),
pigs (n = 12), horses (n = 10), sheep (n = 6), roedeer (n =
12), wild birds (n = 6), food poisoning outbreaks (n = 15)

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/47

and environmental samples (n = 14) (Table 1). The isolates were collected between 1994 to 2003 (Table 1), all
isolates from sludge were collected 2002. One C. perfringens type strain CCUG 1795 (A) and five reference strains,
CIP 106526 (A), CCUG 2035 (B), CCUG 2036 (C),
CCUG 2037 (D) and CCUG 44727 (E), were also
included in the study. CCUG strains were obtained from
the Culture Collection of the University of Gothenburg,
Sweden; the CIP strain was obtained from the Culture
Collection of Institute Pasteur, Paris, France. The C. perfringens isolates were identified as type A by applying
standard biochemical tests and multiplex-PCR [22]. The
isolates were stored at -70°C. Thawed isolates were grown
on fastidious anaerobe agar (FAA) (LabM, Bury, Lancashire, England) with 10% defibrinated horse blood and
incubated in anaerobic jars at 37°C.
PCR
The four major toxin genes plc, cpb1, iap and etx were
detected by a modified version of the multiplex PCR assay
of Engström et al. [22]. Template DNA (2 μl), prepared by
the direct lysis method of Herholz et al. [10] was added to
a 50 μl reaction mixture, with the following reagents: 50
mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 50
nM of each deoxynucleotide, 1 U of AmpliTaq Gold DNA
polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA), 50
nM of each plc (α-toxin) primer, 25 nM of each cpb1
primer, 100 nM of each etx primer and 25 nM of each iap
primer. The thermocycling (incubations for 1 min at
94°C, 55°C and 72°C, respectively, repeated 35 times)
was preceded by incubation for 10 min at 94°C. The presence of the CPB2 gene (cpb2) and enterotoxin gene (cpe)
was also determined. cpb2 primers (250 nM) from Herholz et al. [10] and cpe primers (50 nM) from Kadra et al.
[35] were used in a duplex PCR. The conditions were as in
the multiplex PCR, except for the annealing temperature,
which was 59°C. The amplicons were analysed by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose gel according to standard procedures.
PFGE
The isolates analysed by PFGE are listed in Table 1. The
PFGE protocol of Lukinmaa et al. [20] was followed in all
essentials. DNA was digested with SmaI. Electrophoresis
was performed at 6 V/cm with 2.0% AgaroseNA agar
(Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) by using the
CHEF-DR II system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond,
Calif, USA). Running conditions for SmaI-digested DNA
were 0.5 to 40 s for 20 h. Lambda ladder with a size range
of 0.13 to 194 kb (Low Range PFG Marker, New England
Biolabs Inc.) and Salmonella Braenderup (H9812)
digested with XbaI, which is described in greater detail by
Hunter et al. [33], were used as molecular weight standards. The DNA bands were visualized on a UV transilluminator and Polaroid photographs of the gels were scanned

and images in tiff file format were imported into GelCompar II (Applied Maths, Kortrijk, Belgium). Degrees of similarity between isolates were calculated with 1.4%
tolerance and 0.5% optimization by applying the bandbased Dice similarity coefficient. Clustering analysis was
performed with the unweighted pair group method
(UPGMA), by average linkages.
Sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA genes
The 16S rRNA genes of the isolates were amplified with
primers [36] suitable for members of the phylum Firmicutes (Table 4). The amplicons were used for cycle
sequencing with labelled terminators (Big Dye; Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, Calif, USA) and with the sequencing primers listed in Table 4. The sequencing products
were analysed with an ABI Prism 3100 genetic analyser
(Applied Biosystems) and contigs were generated with the
Contig Express program included in the Vector NTI Suite
(InforMax, Bethesda, Md, USA). The contigs were edited
manually with the Genetic Data Environment software
[37] before further analysis and deposition in GenBank.

Authors' contributions
AJ, KEJ, AA, VB, BEE participitated in the discussions on
the study design, the collection of isolates, analysis and
interpretation of the data, and in the writing of the manuscript. AJ and AA carried out the analysis and interpretation of PFGE data. Analysis and interpretation of sequence
data of the cpb2 gene and 16S rRNA gene were carried out
by AJ, KEJ and EB. AJ was the principal author of the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.

Sequence analysis of the cpb2 genes
The cpb2 gene of the 28 cpb2-positive isolates was amplified with the β2 primers (250 nM) from Herholz etal. [10]
and these primers were also used in the cycle sequencing
reaction, as described earlier. The cpb2 sequences determined in this work were aligned with sequences retrieved
from GenBank by the AlignX program in the Vector NTI
Suite. The alignment was checked with the Genetic Data
Environment software [37]. A phylogenetic tree comprising 88 cpb2 sequences was constructed by the neighbourjoining method [38] from a distance matrix that was corrected for multiple substitutions at single locations by the
two-parameter method [39]. A representative of cluster Ib
was chosen as outgroup. Only one representative for each
subgroup was included in the final tree. The distance
matrix comprised 425 nucleotide positions, corresponding to positions 282 to 706 in the cpb2 sequence of C. perTable 4: General PCR and sequencing primers used for amplification of 16S rDNA
