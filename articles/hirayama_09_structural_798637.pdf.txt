Abstract
Background: The combined sequences encoding a partial and putative rpsI open reading frame
(ORF), non-coding (NC) region, a putative ORF for the Campylobacter adhesin to fibronectin-like
protein (cadF), a putative Cla_0387 ORF, NC region and a partial and putative Cla_0388 ORF, were
identified in 16 Campylobacter lari isolates, using two novel degenerate primer pairs. Probable
consensus sequence at the -35 and -10 regions were identified in all C. lari isolates, as a promoter.
Results: Thus, cadF (-like) gene is highly conserved among C. lari organisms. Transcription of the
cadF (-like) gene in C. lari cells in vivo was also confirmed and the transcription initiation site was
determined. A peptidoglycan-associating alpha-helical motif in the C-terminal regions of some
bacterial cell-surface proteins was completely conserved amongst the putative cadF (-like) ORFs
from the C. lari isolates.
Conclusion: The putative cadF (-like) ORFs from all C. lari isolates were nine amino acid larger
than those from C. jejuni, and showed amino acid residues 137 -140 of FALG (50% identity), instead
of the FRLS residues of the maximal fibronectin-binding activity site demonstrated within C. jejuni
CadF. A neighbor joining tree constructed based on cadF (-like) gene sequence information formed
a major cluster consisting of C. lari isolates, separating from the other three thermophilic
campylobacters.

Background
Thermophilic Campylobacter species, primarily Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli, are curved, Gram-negative organisms, belonging to the ε-Proteobacteria, and are the most
commonly recognized cause of acute bacterial diarrhea in
the Western world [1-3].

Campylobacter lari is a relatively recently discovered thermophilic Campylobacter species that was first isolated from
mammalian and avian species, particularly seagulls of the
genus Larus [1,4]. C. lari has also been shown to be a cause
of clinical infection [5-9].

In addition, an atypical group of isolates of urease-positive thermophilic Campylobacter (UPTC) have been isolated from the natural environment in England in 1985
[10]. Thereafter, these organisms were described as a biovar or variant of C. lari [11,12]. Subsequent reports
described four human isolates in France [11,13]. Some
additional isolates of UPTC have also been reported in
Northern Ireland [14-16] in The Netherlands [17] and in
Japan [18,19]. Thus, these two representative taxa, namely
urease-negative (UN) C. lari and UPTC occur within the
species of C. lari [20].
Bacterial pathogens have the ability to bind to fibronectin
(Fn; a component of the extracellular matrix) [21-24].
Konkel et al. identified and cloned a gene encoding a
fibronectin-binding protein (Campylobacter adhesin to Fn;
CadF) from C. jejuni [22]. In C. jejuni and C. coli, the cadF
virulence gene encodes a 37 kDa outer membrane protein
that promotes the binding of these pathogens to intestinal
epithelial cells [15].
In relation to cadF of thermophilic Campylobacter other
than C. jejuni and C. coli described above, cadF and outer
membrane protein gene F (OprF) have been identified in
C. coli RM2228 (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession number
AAFL01000010 and ZP_00368187), C. lari RM2100
(AAFK01000002 and YP_002574995) and C. upsaliensis
RM3195 (AAFJ01000008 and ZP_00371707), following
whole genome shotgun sequence analysis [26]. However,
no detailed descriptions of the cadF (oprF) gene have yet
appeared for these thermophilic Campylobacter strains. In
addition, no reports on the cadF (-like) gene in C. lari
organisms have yet appeared.
Therefore, the aim of the present study was to clone,
sequence and analyze the full-length gene encoding the
Fn-binding (-like) protein (CadF) and its adjacent genetic
loci from several C. lari organisms (UN C. lari and UPTC).
We also aimed to confirm the expression of the gene in the
C. lari cells.

Results
TA cloning, sequencing and sequence analyses of the fulllength cadF gene and its adjacent genetic loci from the 16
isolates of C. lari
The two primer pairs (f-/r-cadF1 and f-/r-cadF2; Figure1)
successfully amplified PCR products of approximately 1.4
and 1.2 [kilo base pairs (kbp)], respectively, with all 16
isolates of C. lari employed (data not shown). Following
TA cloning and sequencing, the combined nucleotide and
deduced amino acid sequence data from the 16 isolates of
C. lari determined have been made accessible in the
DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank, with the accession numbers indicated in Table 1.

The combined sequences of an approximately 2.3 kbp
region encoding a partial and putative ribosomal protein
SI rpsI open reading frame (ORF) (165 bp), a NC region
downstream of the ORF (approximately 250 bp), a putative cadF (-like) ORF (984 bp), a Cla_0387 ORF (642 bp),
a NC region (approximately 120 bp) and a partial and
putative Cla_0388 ORF (126 or 128 bp) were identified
with all 16 C. lari isolates examined.
The present sequence analyses identified the putative ORF
for cadF (-like) gene to be 984 bp [nucleotide position
(np) 414-1,397 bp for the C. lari JCM2530T] with all 16 C.
lari isolates (n = 4 UN C. lari; n = 12 UPTC) and UN C. lari
RM 2100. With regard to the cadF-like gene, the sequence
commenced with an ATG start codon for all isolates and
terminated with a TAA for 13 isolates and with a TGA for
the other three isolates (NCTC12894, 12895 and 99).
Regarding putative ORFs for cadF (-like) gene, apparent
size differences occurred amongst the four thermophilic
Campylobacter species examined, 984 bp (328 amino acid
residues) for 16 C. lari isolates and C. lari RM2100 strain,
957 (319) for C. jejuni RM1221 and NCTC11168, 996
(332) for C. coli RM2228, and 948 (316) for C. upsaliensis
RM3195, as shown in Table 2, although in this limited
study a small number of reference strains of C. jejuni, C.
coli and C. upsaliensis were examined. Probable ribosomebinding (RB) sites, AGGA (np 404-407 bp) [Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequences] [27], that are complementary to a
highly conserved sequence of CCUCCU, close to the 3'
end of 16S rRNA, were also identified in all the C. lari isolates examined.
In the region upstream of the cadF-like gene, a most probable promoter consensus sequence at the -10 region
(TATAAT) (TAGAAT for UPTC isolates (271-276 for UPTC
CF89-12)) was identified at the locus between np 272 and
277 bp, with all 16 C. lari isolates and the C. lari RM2100
strain. In addition, probable -35 regions (np 243-248)
upstream of the -10 region were also identified, in all C.
lari isolates examined.
A putative ORF for the Cla_0387 gene was also estimated
to be 642 bp with all 16 C. lari isolates examined (np
1,404 - 2,045 bp). The Cla_0387 gene commenced with a
TTG and terminated with a TAA with all 16 C. lari isolates
and the C. lari RM2100 strain. Apparent small size differences of the putative ORFs for the Cla_0387 also occurred
amongst the four thermophilic Campylobacter species
examined (Table 2).
As shown in Table 3, the nucleotide sequences of the fulllength cadF (-like) structural gene from the 17 C. lari isolates showed 89.4-100.0% similarities to each other
(Table 3). The nucleotide sequences of the full-length
Cla_0387 structural gene from the 17 C. lari isolates

showed 85.1 - 100.0% similarities to each other (Table 4).
Thus, the nucleotide sequence similarities of the cadF-like
gene appear to be slightly higher than those of the
Cla_0387 gene, amongst the 16 C. lari isolates and the C.
lari RM2100 strain examined.
Moreover, the deduced amino acid sequence alignment
analyses were also performed for putative ORFs of the fulllength cadF (-like) gene of 16 C. lari isolates, as well as
those of C. lari RM2100, C. jejuni, C. coli and C. upsaliensis
strains. The putative ORFs from the 17 C. lari isolates
showed 90.9 - 100.0% amino acid sequence similarities to
each other, and 56.4 - 57.9% similarities, with those of
two C. jejuni strains (Table 3). They also showed 53.5 55.8% similarities with those of other thermophilic
Campylobacter organisms (two strains of C. coli and C.
upsaliensis; Table 3).
Thus, the putative ORFs of the full-length cadF (-like) gene
from the 17 C. lari isolates identified in the present study
are identical size (984 bp and 328 amino acid residues)
with sequence heterogeneity, at both nucleotide and
amino acid levels.
As shown in Table 4, the deduced amino acid sequence
similarities were also examined for the putative ORFs of

the full-length Cla_0387 gene among the 17 C. lari isolates (86.9 - 100.0%) and other thermophilic Campylobacter organisms (50.7 - 56.2%), employed as references
(data not shown).
Thus, cadF (-like) gene is highly conserved among C. lari
organisms isolated from humans and natural environments in several countries of Asia, Europe and North
America.
In relation to the NC regions, two NC regions of approximately 250 bp, including a promoter at the -10 region and
120 bp occurred upstream of the cadF (-like) gene and
downstream of the Cla_0387 gene, respectively, when
examined combined sequences from all 16 C. lari isolates.
Nucleotide sequences of approximately 250 bp from the
16 C. lari isolates and C. lari RM2100 showed 85.0 100.0% sequences similarities to each other (Table 5).
Nucleotide sequences of approximately 120 bp also
showed 85.6 - 100.0% sequence similarities among the 17
C. lari isolates. Thus, a considerable genetic heterogeneity
of nucleotide sequences in the 250 bp NC region, fulllength cadF (-like) gene, full-length Cla_0387 gene and
the 120 bp NC region identified in the present study also
occurred among the 17 C. lari isolates including the C. lari
RM2100 strain.

Northern blot hybridization, reverse transcription-PCR
and primer extension analysis
Northern blot hybridization analysis detected the cadF (like) gene transcription in the two C. lari isolates cells, UN
C. lari JCM2530T and UPTC CF89-12 (Figure 2A). Since
the positive signals of the hybridization were shown at
around 1,600 bp (Figure 2A), the cadF (-like) gene may
possibly be transcribed together with the Cla_0387 gene.
Thus, cadF (-like) gene transcription was confirmed in the
C. lari organisms. When RT-PCR analysis was carried out
for the RNA components extracted from the UN C. lari
JCM2530T and UPTC isolates CF89-12 cells with the
primer pair of f-cadF2 in the cadF (-like) gene and r-cadF3
in the Cla_0387 gene, as shown in Figure 1, a positive RTPCR signal was detected at around 800 bp region with
both isolates, respectively (Figure 2B).

The transcription initiation site for the cadF (-like) gene
was determined by the primer extension analysis (Figure
2C). The +1 transcription initiation site for the cadF (-like)
gene is underlined in the following sequence; 5'-TTTTATAATTTCAAAG-3', as shown in Figure 2C.

Deduced amino acid sequence alignment analysis and
phylogenetic analyses of the cadF (-like) ORF
We carried out deduced amino acid sequence alignment
analysis to elucidate the differences in CadF (-like) protein amongst the thermophilic Campylobacter. As shown in
Figure 3, the C. coli RM2228 strain carried a strech of 12
amino acid (VVTPAPAPVVSQ) from amino acid positions
190 to 201, as well as a Q at amino acid position 180, and
regarding the nine larger amino acid for C. lari isolates
than C. jejuni strains, four amino acid sequences (THTD)
from amino acid positions 80 to 83 and five [A(T for
UPTC 99) KQID] from 193 to 197 were identified to
occur.

When, in retation to a single Fn-binding domain localized
at four amino acid (FRLS; CadF amino acid positions 134137 for C. jejuni) [28], amino acid sequence alignment
analysis was carried out, the putative cadF (-like) ORFs
from all 17 C. lari isolates examined showed amino acid
residues of FALG (50% identity) within the amino acid
positions 137-140 instead of the FRLS residues, as shown
in Figure 4.

A dendrogram showing phylogenetic relationships constructed by the NJ method [29] based on nucleotide
sequence information of full-length cadF (-like) gene from
16 C. lari isolates and C. lari RM2100 and other thermophilic Campylobacter reference strains, the 17 C. lari
isolates forming a major cluster separating from the other
three thermophilic Campylobacter spp. (Figure 5). In addition, UN C. lari and UPTC organisms were not different
and similar based on the nucleotide sequence data of the
cadF (-like) gene, as shown in Figure 5.

Discussion
This is the first demonstration of the structural analysis of
the full-length gene encoding a CadF (-like) protein and
its adjacent genetic loci within C. lari.
Regarding the NC region upstream of the cadF (-like)
gene, this region is approximately 250 bp in length with
all 16 C. lari isolates and C. lari RM2100 strain. However,
the NC regions from the eight C. jejuni and a C. coli reference strains shown in Table 1 examined, are shorter than
those and approximately 150 bp in length with unknown
reason(s).
In 1995, Koebnik described a peptidoglycan-associating
alpha-helical consensus motif in the C-terminal regions of
16 bacterial cell-surface proteins (NX2 LSX2 RAX2 VX3L)
[30]. When we compared the corresponding amino acid
sequences of the putative cadF (-like) ORF from the 17 C.

lari and some C. jejuni isolates with this consensus motif,
the motif was completely conserved amongst the cadF (like) ORFs from the isolates (data not shown).
As shown in Table 2, the CMW of the putative cadF (-like)
ORF was estimated to be 36,578 to 36,869 Da for the 16
C. lari isolates and C. lari RM2100 reference strain (data
not shown). In addition, the value was also estimated to
be approximately 36 kDa for the two C. jejuni reference
strains (Table 2). These estimated CMW values are in
agreement with the previous description of the immunodetection of the CadF protein from five C. jejuni and C. coli
isolates [25].
When the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence
alignment analyses were carried out for the putative cadF
(-like) ORF, apparent size differences occurred amongst
the four thermophilic Campylobacter species, as described
above. Regarding the putative ORFs for cadF (-like) gene
between C. lari and C. jejuni organisms, nine amino acid
residues are shorter in C. jejuni strains than in C. lari isolates.
Recently, Krause-Gruszczynska et al. (2007) described that
the CadF protein from C. coli strains was 13 amino acid
larger than those from C. jejuni strains, based on the
deduced amino acid sequence alignment analysis [31].
This is consistent with our present results (Table 2). They
also indicated that C. coli strains carried a stretch of 13

addition, in the present study, the deduced CadF (-like)
protein was shown to be 328 amino acid from all 17 C.
lari isolates and were nine amino acid larger than CadF
from two C. jejuni strains (319 amino acid) (Table 2).
Then, we carried out deduced amino acid sequence alignment analysis to elucidate the differences in CadF (-like)
protein between C. lari and C. jejuni organisms. As shown
in Figure 3, the C. coli RM2228 strain carried a stretch of
12 amino acid (VVTPAPAPVVSQ) from amino acid positions 190 to 201 as well as a Q at amino acid position 180
(Figure 3). In relation to the nine larger amino acid for C.

lari isolates than C. jejuni strains, interestingly, four amino
acid sequences (THTD) from amino acid positions 80 to
83 and five [A(T for UPTC99) KQID] from 193 to 197
were identified, as shown in Figure 3.
Regarding the CadF in Campylobacter, the cadF virulence
gene, encoding 37 kDa outer membrane protein that promotes the binding of the pathogens to intestinal epithelial
cells, was identified and cloned [22,25]. In relation to
identification of the binding domain within C. jejuni

Amino acid sequence alignment analysisisolates (around a single-Fn binding domain within C. jejuni CadF) of the putative ORF
Figure (-like) gene from the 17 C. lari of part
for cadF 4
Amino acid sequence alignment analysis of part (around a single-Fn binding domain within C. jejuni CadF) of
the putative ORF for cadF (-like) gene from the 17 C. lari isolates. Amino acid sequences of those from the C. jejuni
and C. coli reference strains were aligned for comparison. FALG residues of C. lari and FRLS residues of C. jejuni and C. coli
strains were underlined, respectively. In this Figure, amino acid sequence of AdpB (aa 201-230) from Prevotella intermedia 17
[32] was also aligned for comparison. FNLG residues of P. intermedia 17 were also underlined. The alignment analysis data from
the UN C. lari isolates RM2100, 298, 300 and 84C-1, from the UPTC isolates NCTC12892, 12893, 12895, 12896, CF89-12, A1,
A2, A3, 89049 and 92251, and from C. jejuni strains RM1221, 81-176, 260.94, CF93-6, HB93-13, 8425 and ss doylei 269.97 were
omitted from the Figure, because of the occurrence of the identical sequences.

(CadF amino acid positions 134 -137), consisting of the
residues, phenylalanine-arginine-leucine-serine (FRLS)
[28]. However, when amino acid sequence alignment
analysis was carried out, the putative cadF (-like) ORFs
from all 17 C. lari isolates examined in the present study
showed amino acid residues of FALG (50% identity)
within the amino acid positions 137 - 140, instead of the
FRLS residues (Figure 4). No FRLS residues were also
detected within any other regions of the cadF (-like) ORF
from all 17 C. lari isolates examined. Interestingly, FNLG
residues within AdpB (Ad-adhesin in p-Prevotella, B-second identified adhesin) in Prevotella intermedia (a blackpigmented gram-negative anaerobe) [32] was 75% identical to the FALG from C. lari (Figure 4). Therefore, it may
be important to clarify if the CadF (-like) protein from C.
lari isolates can bind to fibronectin or not. An experiment
is now in progress to resolve this.
In the present study, for the first time, we have described
the cloning, sequencing and characterization of fulllength Cla_0387 from the 16 C. lari isolates. The CMW
values were estimated to be 23,689 - 23,875 Da for the 16
C. lari isolates and C. lari RM2100 strain and these values
were also equivalent to those from two C. jejuni and a C.
coli reference strains (Table 2). In addition, the cadF (-like)
gene and the Cla_0387 gene may possibly be functional
within C. lari isolates, based on the present northern blot
hybridization and RT-PCR observations, as shown in Figure 2A and 2B.
Thus, the cadF (-like) gene and the Cla_0387 gene could
be co-transcribed within C. lari organisms, consisting of
an operon. Since the Cla_0387 showed a high deduced
amino acid sequence similarity to the Escherichia coli
haloacid dehalogenase-like phosphatase [33], these two
may have an important biological relationship within the
C. lari cells.

In the present study, the authors designed two novel
primer pairs (f-/r-cadF1 and f-/r-cadF2) in silico for amplification of an approximate 2.3 kbp region, including the
full-length cadF (-like) gene and its adjacent genetic loci,
based on sequence information of C. lari RM2100, C.
jejuni RM1221 and C. coli RM2228 strains, resulting in
successful amplification, TA-cloning and sequencing of
those from the 16 C. lari isolates isolated from differencet
sources and in several countries. Therefore, the present
novel PCR primer pairs would be likely of value for, C.
jejuni and C. coli organisms, as well as for other C. lari isolates.
A dendrogram showing phylogenetic relationships was
constructed by the NJ method [29], based on nucleotide
sequence information of full-length cadF (-like) gene from
16 C. lari isolates and C. lari RM2100 and other thermophilic Campylobacter reference strains. As shown in Figure 5, the 17 C. lari isolates form a major cluster
separating from the other three thermophilic Campylobacter spp. In addition, the 17 C. lari isolates form some
minor clusters, respectively, based on nucleotide
sequence information from cadF (-like) gene (Figure 5).
Thus, nucleotide sequence information of full-length cadF
(-like) gene can be regarded as reliable in the molecular
discrimination of C. lari organisms from the other three
thermophilic campylobacters. In addition, Figure 5 also
indicated that NJ dendrogram of UN C. lari and UPTC
organisms were not different and similar based on the
nucleotide sequence data of the cadF-like gene.

Conclusion
The combined sequences encoding a partial and putative
rpsI open reading frame (ORF), non-coding (NC) region,
a putative ORF for the Campylobacter adhesin to fibronectin-like gene, a putative Cla_0387 ORF, NC region and a
partial and putative Cla_0388 ORF, were identified in 16

A phylogenetic tree constructed based on nucleotide sequence information of full-length cadF (-like) gene
from 17 C. lari isolates and other thermophilic campylobacters. The tree was constructed by the NJ method [29]. values, 0.02, in the figure represent evolutionary distances. Boot-strap values of 1,000 are shown at the branch point. Out-group
is C. upsaliensis RM3195.

Campylobacter lari isolates, using two novel degenerate
primer pairs. Transcription of the cadF-like gene in C. lari
cells in vivo was also confirmed and the transcription initiation site was determined. The putative cadF (-like)
ORFs from all C. lari isolates were nine amino acid larger
than those from C. jejuni, and showed amino acid residues 137 -140 of FALG (50% identity), instead of the
FRLS residues of the maximal fibronectin-binding activity
site demonstrated within C. jejuni CadF.

These isolates were cultured on Mueller-Hinton broth
medium at 37°C for 48 h in an aerobic jar on Blood Agar
Base No. 2 (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) containing 7% (v/v)
defibrinated horse blood (Nippon Bio-Test, Tokyo,
Japan) and Campylobacter selective medium (Virion,
Zurich, Switzerland). An atmosphere of 5% (v/v) O2 and
10% (v/v) CO2 was produced by BBL Campypak Microaerophilic System Envelopes (Bacton Dickinson, NJ,
USA).

Methods

Genomic DNA preparation, primer design and PCR
amplification
Genomic DNA was prepared using sodium dodecyl sulfate and proteinase K treatment, phenol-chloroform
extraction and ethanol precipitation [34].

Campylobacter isolates and culture conditions
C. lari isolates (n = 4 UN C. lari; n = 12 UPTC), which were
isolated from different sources and in several countries of
Asia, Europe and North America and used in the present
study, are shown in Table 1.

Two novel degenerate primer pairs (f-/r-cadF1 and f-/rcadF2) were first designed in silico to generate two PCR
products of approximately 1.4 and 1.2 kbp respectively,
corresponding to the full-length cadF-like gene and its
adjacent genetic loci, including full-length Cla_0387
(approximately 2.3 kbp) for the C. lari isolates, based on
the sequence information of C. lari RM2100, C. jejuni
RM1221 and C. coli RM2228 strains. A schematic representation of the cadF gene and its adjacent genetic loci for
C. lari RM2100 (AAFK01000002) [26], including the locations of the two primer pairs and nucleotide sequences of
the primers designed in silico in the present study, are
shown in Figure 1.
PCR mixtures contained 50 ng of template DNA, 10 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 400 μM of
each dNTP, 0.6 μM of each primer, and a total of 1 unit of
rTaq DNA polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan).
PCR was performed in 50 μl reaction volumes, for 30
cycles of 94°C for 1.0 min, 50°C for the f-/r-cadF1 and
45°C for the f-/r-cadF2 for 0.5 min, and 72°C for 1.5 min,
followed by a final extension at 72°C for 5.0 min.
TA cloning, nucleotide sequencing and sequence analyses
Amplified PCR products were separated by 1.0% (w/v)
agarose gel electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE at 100 V and
detected by staining with ethidium bromide. PCR products amplified by the newly constructed two primer pairs
were purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Tokyo, Japan) and inserted into the pGEM-T vector
using the pGEM-T Easy Vector System (Promega Corp.
Tokyo, Japan). Sequencing of the cloned cadF (-like) gene
fragments was performed with a Hitachi DNA autosequencer (SQ5500EL; Hitachi Electronics Engineering Co.
Tokyo, Japan), after dideoxy nucleotide sequencing using
a Thermo Sequenase Pre-Mixed Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo, Japan). Sequence
analysis of the PCR amplicons was carried out using the
computer software GENETYX-MAC version 9 (GENETYX
Co., Tokyo, Japan).
Total cellular RNA purification, reverse transcription-PCR,
northern blot hybridization and primer extension analysis
Total cellular RNA was extracted and purified from C. lari
cells by using RNA protect Bacteria Reagent and RNeasy
Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR was
carried out with a primer pair of f-cadF2 and r-cadF3 (Figure 1), by using the QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN). This primer pair is expected to generate a RT-PCR
product of the cadF (-like) structural gene segment of
approximately 780 bp including the Cla_0387 region.
Northern blot hybridization analysis was carried out
according to the procedure described by Sambrook and
Russell (2001) [34], using a PCR amplified cadF (-like)
fragment as a probe. The fragment was amplified using a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/192

primer pair of f-/r-cadF4 (Figure 1). Random primer extension was performed in order to prepare the fragment
probe using a DIG-High Prime (Roche Applied Science,
Penzberg, Germany).
The transcription initiation site for the cadF (-like) gene
was determined by the primer extension analysis with the
purified total cellular RNA of C. lari JCM2530T cells. The
primer that was selected for this assay was 5'-CTAAATTTCCTTCTGGMGTTGT-3', which corresponds to the reverse
complementary sequence of np 504 through 525. The
transcription initiation site was determined by primer
extension with the sizes of DNA fragments generated by
sequencing reactions. In the present study, the np which
the authors used, are for those of C. lari JCM2530T.
Phylogenetic analysis
Nucleotide sequences of approximately 980 bp of the fulllength cadF (-like) gene, from the isolates of C. lari and the
C. lari RM2100 strain, were compared to each other and
with the accessible sequence data from some other thermophilic campylobacters using CLUSTAL W software,
respectively [35], which was incorporated in the DDBJ.
Following this, a phylogenetic tree was constructed by the
neighbor-joining (NJ) method [29].
