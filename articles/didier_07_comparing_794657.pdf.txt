Abstract
Background: In general, the construction of trees is based on sequence alignments. This
procedure, however, leads to loss of informationwhen parts of sequence alignments (for instance
ambiguous regions) are deleted before tree building. To overcome this difficulty, one of us
previously introduced a new and rapid algorithm that calculates dissimilarity matrices between
sequences without preliminary alignment.
Results: In this paper, HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency
Virus) sequence data are used to evaluate this method. The program produces tree topologies that
are identical to those obtained by a combination of standard methods detailed in the HIV Sequence
Compendium. Manual alignment editing is not necessary at any stage. Furthermore, only one userspecified parameter is needed for constructing trees.
Conclusion: The extensive tests on HIV/SIV subtyping showed that the virus classifications
produced by our method are in good agreement with our best taxonomic knowledge, even in noncoding LTR (Long Terminal Repeat) regions that are not tractable by regular alignment methods
due to frequent duplications/insertions/deletions. Our method, however, is not limited to the HIV/
SIV subtyping. It provides an alternative tree construction without a time-consuming aligning
procedure.

Background
Almost all existing methods for comparing biological
sequences are based on certain implicit (and necessary)
assumptions about the kinds of changes sequences
undergo during their putative evolution. Under these

assumptions, some changes like permutations and inversions are often ignored (see however [1-3]) while other
kinds of changes (insertions/deletions, for instance) are
poorly evaluated because they do not follow regular evolutionary models. As a result, the regions in which these

changes occur are often treated as ambiguous and are
deleted from sequence alignments before further evolutionary analysis. In addition, as no single alignment
method copes with tremendous variety of sequence data,
expert editing (manual alignment) becomes often necessary. This is particularly important if the sequences have
successive duplications/deletions [4,5], and permutations.
To solve these problems, there has been work on methods
of comparing sequences without alignments. An intuitive
way of comparing sequences without alignments is to
compare their compositions, i.e. the frequency of nucleotides or amino acids appearing in the sequences, as two
sequences with significantly different compositions cannot be closely related. However, it is also true that two
unrelated sequences can have very similar compositions.
So the next step is to consider all N-words in a set of
sequences (an N-word consists of N consecutive letters in
a sequence) to calculate sequence dissimilarities [6]. This
can show some evolutionary relationships. The problem
is that the only straightforward relationship between two
words is that they are either identical or different. This can
be compensated by considering «imperfectly matched
words». The problem is then a combinatorial explosion:
as we all know, there are too many ways of being imperfect.
To track the evolutionary information embedded in
ambiguous regions of sequence alignments and to alleviate the burden of manual editing, one of us developed a
method that allows comparison by considering «local
decoding of order N» of sequences (also called «N-local
decoding method»), and keeping information of each set
of overlapping (step 1) N-words that cover each site in a
sequence [7]. The method is recapitulated in a recent work
describing a new algorithm that computes the «local
decoding of order N» of a sequence (or a set of sequences)
with a complexity linear in sequence length, both in time
and memory space [8].
The method was found useful for assessing a manually
constructed HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) LTR
(long terminal repeat) multiple alignment, which is
homology blocks based [5]. «Related sites» were found to
correspond to homology blocks between compared
sequences, leading us to think that the comparison of the
sequences «composition» in «locally decoded letters»
could yield a new method for calculating dissimilarities
between sequences without an alignment and consequently without taking into account the order of homology blocks in each sequence.
The new method has also been tested against 10 reference
alignment-based dissimilarity matrices calculated from 10

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/1

multiple alignments of DNA or RNA sequences: it gives
alignment-free dissimilarities in very good agreement
with the reference alignment-based dissimilarity matrices
(better than the correlation obtained when the alignmentfree dissimilarity matrix was calculated from the comparison of sequence compositions in words of length N) [8].
The aims of this paper are: (A) to give a concise description of this new method (see the section Methods) (B) to
apply it to a problem of biological interest, namely the
classification of HIV/SIV, two of the most variable organisms known so far (see Results and Discussion).

Results
The N-local decoding method on complete genome
sequences – tests on HIV/SIV complete sequences
The N-local decoding method was used to calculate dissimilarity matrices for all 70 sequences described in Methods section. Four incomplete genome sequences (HIV-2
subtype C, D, E, F) were also included here because these
sequences may have kept strong subtyping signals that are
in the complete genome sequences. Figure 1 shows a tree
obtained from the dissimilarity matrices calculated by our
method. Two types of HIV, representing independent
cross-species transmission events [9], are clearly distinguished: HIV-1 is closer to SIV-CPZ, and HIV-2 is closer to
SIV-SMM. Nine subtypes of HIV-1 group M cluster distinctly, with sub-subtypes significantly more closely
related to each other (A1 and A2, F1 and F2, B and D –
though B and D are regarded as subtypes instead of subsubtypes for historical reasons [10]). Subtype K is more
distant from sub-subtypes F1 and F2 than these are from
each other, but closer to F1 and F2 that to other subtypes,
i.e., in the range of subtype B and D distances [11]. HIV-1
groups N and O are in the expected distances from the M
group. The N group intercalates between HIV-1 group M
and SIV-CPZ (CPZ-CAM3, -CAM5, -GAB and -US), consistent with a suggestion that group N is a recombinant
between a SIV-CPZ strain and a virus related to the ancestor of group M [12]. The group O is intercalated between
these CPZ (CPZ-CAM3, -CAM5, -GAB and -US) and CPZANT that is the borderline in the HIV-1/SIV-CPZ lineages
[13]. HIV-2 subtypes also form clear clusters, respectively,
including subtypes C, D, E, and F that are about half of gag
region.

Consequently, the topology of the tree shown in Figure 1
agrees very well with existing knowledge [9-11,14,15] and
recognizes significant HIV/SIV evolutionary events.
The computational program used to calculate the dissimilarity matrices from which the trees can be constructed
has been tested for a wide range of values of N, which is
the only user-specified parameter of the local decoding
method. When N ranges from 13 to 35, there is no signif-

The N-local decoding method on short sequences – tests
on HIV/SIV gag, pol, env and nef sequences
HIV/SIV exhibit great variety in different parts of their
genomes, with env representing the most variable region.
All 70 sequences described in the Methods section were
used to test different sequence regions. For gag, 66 HIV/
SIV sequences (only the gag region is used) and 4 HIV-2
sequences that cover partial gag (sequence length 771–
781 nt, in contrast to 1473–1569 nt of the complete gag
sequences) were tested. For other genome regions, pol
(2993–3360 nt),env (2499–2658 nt) and nef (292–783
nt), only 66 sequences were selected because of unavailability of sequences in these regions from HIV-2 subtype C,
D, E, F. The trees of these four regions, based on the Nlocal decoding calculated sequence distance matrices (see
figures «gag18_tree», «pol22_tree», «env15_tree, and
«nef13_tree» at [16]), also agree well with the established
HIV/SIV phylogenetic trees in these regions [9-11,14,15]
with the exception of nef. A few discrepancies exist in nef:
in our method, HIV-1 group M sub-subtypes F1 and F2
mix together. Subtype K, depending on the chosen value
of N, either is still close to F1/F2 as expected, or is isolated
or loosely related to subtype J. SIV-CPZ-ANT is intermediary between HIV-1-M-N/SIV-CPZ-HIV-1-O and HIV-2/
SIV-SMM. These discrepancies may simply reflect uneven
sequence complexity in different genome regions, or just
reflect the differences in treating ambiguous alignment
regions: the N-local decoding method keeps all these
regions while the traditional alignment-based methods
have to delete those alignment regions in order to produce
an unbiased tree.

The best orders N tested in these regions are: gag, N = 11
to 23; pol, N = 11 to 30; env, N = 12 to 24; and nef, N = 11
to 20.
The N-local decoding method on sequences that
traditional alignment-based methods cannot deal with –
tests on non-coding LTR sequences
Forty-three of the 70 sequences (retrieved from the HIV
sequence database as described in Methods section) cover
the non-coding part of LTR (complete non-coding LTR
region or at least the 5' portion of this segment including
the polyadenylation signal AATAAA). The length of this
part ranges from 211 to 328 nt in the HIV-1/SIV-CPZ subset, and 433 to 508 nt in the HIV-2/SIV-SMM subset.
These short non-coding LTR segments contain many

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/1

duplications/insertions/deletions that make them difficult for traditional alignment-based phylogenic studies
[5].
There is no suitable reference tree available for this noncoding LTR region. Thus we built trees based on CLUSTAL-W [18] and DIALIGN-2 [19] alignments and compared them with the N-local-decoding-method-based
tree. In our method (Figure 2), two types of HIV are very
well characterized in terms of defining their relations to
their SIV origin (HIV-2/SIV-SMM and HIV-1/SIV-CPZ).
The sequence relations among different subtypes of HIV1, HIV-2, and SIV are clearly defined except for A1 and A2
that are not distinguishable from each other. CLUSTALW-based tree (Fig. 3), however, incorrectly clusters HIV-1/
SIV-CPZ, and HIV-1 M, N, O groups. In contrast, the tree
based on DIALIGN-2 (Fig. 4), a multiple alignment program based on homology blocks, features better HIV
clades than CLUSTAL-W-based tree. Subtypes in HIV-1
and HIV-2 are well separated from each other. But this
DIALIGN-based tree is far less satisfactory than the Nlocal-decoding-method-based tree (Fig. 2). For instance,
sub-subtypes in HIV-1 group M mix together; HIV-1 group
N is located inside HIV-1 group M and it is loosely related
to SIV-CPZ; subtype A and G of HIV-1 group M are not
closely related to each other as expected. In other words,
neither CLUSTAL-W- nor DIALIGN-based tree represent
better HIV/SIV sequence relations and distances than the
tree obtained by our method.
In our method, bootstrap values strongly support the clustering of HIV-2 (and their subtypes), SIV-SMM, HIV-1-M,
HIV-1-N, SIV-CPZ, and HIV-1-O. However, in contrast to
Figure 1, the values are low within HIV-1-M. This is not
surprising since these sequences are short and very similar
to each other. The parameter N tested here ranges from 10
to 21 in order to generate the most appropriate neighborjoining trees for those 43 sequences. For various subtypes,
however, this N sometimes falls into different ranges. For
example, N = 9–14, 27–43 and even further make HIV-1
subtype C cluster clearly defined; N = 10–60 and beyond
are needed for HIV-1 subtype G cluster; N = 8–60 and
above are necessary to cluster two J sequences of HIV-1group M. Finally, N = 9–17 are needed to clearly cluster
HIV-1-M/B and D subtype, and N = 19–25 are necessary
to distinguish HIV-1 subtype B and D.
In short, our HIV/SIV subtyping results confirmed the
good performance of the N-local-decoding method,
regardless the complexity of genome regions. The N values listed above not only are useful in making an Nparameter reference for future N-local-decoding method
applications, but also imply different evolutionary pressures in various HIV/SIV clades.

Similarity blocks displayed by the N-local decoding
method – an example of the HIV non-coding LTR
sequences
In our previous study of HIV LTR [5], a sequence alignment had to be manually constructed in order to take into
account the frequent duplications/insertions/deletions
events. This strategy is similar to the N-local-decoding
procedure described in this paper.

Here we use the HIV non-coding-LTR NFKB binding site
(GGGACTTTCCA/G) (see [5]) and its flanking sequences
obtained from 43 sequences (the same sequences used in
non-coding HIV LTR Results section just above) as an
example to show the relationship between the similarity
blocks and the N-classes.
Figure 5 shows the sequences re-written through the Nlocal decoding method definition (N = 11). Each letter
followed by a number identifies an N-class (# indicates a
number with more than one digit). Identical colours
allow easy identification of repeated identifiers in the
same column, and thus facilitate finding similar segments. Two kinds of similarity blocks have been identified
in these 43 sequences. One exists in the NFKB binding
sites, and the other is in NFKB flanking sequences.
(A) Similarity blocks in the NFKB binding sites reveal different duplication events of this site in various HIV clades.
Each HIV-1 group M subtype has two NFKB site copies,
with the exception of subtype C which exhibits an extra ≥
10-letter long fragment (GGG(g)CgTTCCA) with 9 letters
(here upper case letters) matching this NFKB site. Both
HIV-1 group N sequences have two NFKB binding sites
and one or two incomplete copy of such site
(GGGACTTT), and these N-group sequences are more
similar to SIV-CPZ and HIV-1-M than to other HIV clades.
All HIV-1 group O sequences display two copies of a
sequence fragment of 30 letters long (these two copies are
written in two lines to show their similarity in Figure 5).
Each fragment includes a NFKB binding site, a segment
G2A3C2A4 similar to that in HIV-2 subtype B, and a segment C3T#G#C5 similar to SIV-CPZ-GAB. The differences
in the similarity blocks in NFKB binding sites in HIV
clades may indicate an important role the NFKB binding
site played in different independent introductions of SIVCPZ from chimpanzees into the human populations to
establish HIV-1 M, N, O groups.
(B) Similarity blocks in NFKB site flanking sequences may
also provide helpful information in tracking evolutionary
relationships and distances between HIV clades. One
example is the pattern G#C5A1 before the NFKB site, that
only exists in HIV-2 and SIV-SMM sequences. Possibly
this well-preserved G#C5A1 participated actively in the
cross-transmission from SMM to human to establish the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/1

HIV-2. The other example is A2 A# G# G# G# pattern (in
blue) at the 3' end of HIV-2 subtype A flanking sequences.
This pattern distinguishes HIV-2 subtype A from other
HIV clades. This, again, may simply reflect different transmission influences in varied HIV clades.

Discussion
The current HIV sequence analyses usually involve obtaining a gap-stripped multiple alignment to construct an
unbiased phylogenetic tree. The alignment usually is first
generated by HMMER ([20,21] and/or other alignment
softwares, followed by a manual editing [22]. After deleting the ambiguously aligned positions from the alignment, the final alignment leaves about half the sequence
length [13]. This is a time-consuming procedure, and,
most importantly, the alignment quite often underestimates the sequence variabilities, especially those embedded in the ambiguously aligned positions.
In this paper, we introduced a tree building method without a sequence alignment requirement. This N-localdecoding method calculates sequence dissimilarity matrices, based on re-writing, and re-classifies input sequences.
Our HIV/SIV subtyping results showed that the classifications produced by this method agree very well with those
obtained by a combination of standard methods. Thus
comparing biological sequences without alignments
appears to be an alternative to better explore sequence
relationships.
However, there exist some discrepancies between our Nlocal-decoding-method-calculated trees and those
obtained from standard methods. The differences may
simply suggest that the N parameter used in N-localdecoding-method needs to be better defined, or they may
be a consequence of the fact that we include ambiguous
regions that are often ignored by traditional methods.
The N-local-decoding-method is particularly useful in the
analysis of sequence variety and in tracking the sequence
evolutionary events when a good sequence alignment is
not possible. Our N-local-decoding-method is meaningful from the evolutionary point of view. Its success in
sequence subtyping relies on capturing (im)perfect
repeats or conserved regions in sequences (similarity
blocks that are either closely or remotely related, and the
latter one is often undetected by traditional methods due
to removal of ambiguous alignment regions). The similarity blocks include internal repeats in one sequence or conserved regions among sequences, and these blocks are not
necessarily to appear in the same order in the original
sequences. In our method, the inversion could be detected
by including the reverse complementary sequences in the
sequence set.

Similarity blocks found by applying the N-local decoding method (for N = 11) to the HIV non-coding LTR sequences
Figure 5
Similarity blocks found by applying the N-local decoding method (for N = 11) to the HIV non-coding LTR
sequences. This is a nucleotide sequences alignment of the 43 non-coding LTR sequences that are used in the Results section
corresponding to Figures 2-4. The alignment is focused on the NFKB binding site (GGGACTTTCCA/G) and its flanking
sequences. Most often, the similarity blocks are aligned. In the left columns, the sequences are given by their database accession
numbers followed by their nomenclature (HIV-1; HIV-2; SIV-CPZ-CAM 3; -CAM 5; -GAB; -US; SIV-SMM; SIV-SMM-MAC) and
their groups, subtypes and sub-subtypes (for HIV-1 and HIV-2). The sequences are re-grouped according to the phylogeny as
seen in Figures 1-4. The letters are re-written by applying the N-local decoding method (N = 11). When the identifier contains
a number with more than one digit, this number is replaced by a #. Identical recoded letters that are in the same column are
written using the same colour. The sequences are written from the left to the right. The coordinate of the first letter in the file
hivltr.fsa [16], is indicated at the left of this first letter of each sequence displayed. When several sequences are re-grouped
because they are identical (for instance 6 HIV-2-A sequences), the lowest and the highest coordinates are indicated. The
sequences are often written in several lines to show similarities between sequences and parts of sequences.

This method is also practically applicable in terms of computing time and convenience to use. All the calculations
in this paper have been done within a few seconds on a
regular PC. The quality of the algorithm [8] is responsible
for this speed. This algorithm has a complexity linear in
the total length of the set.

(1) HIV-1 group M (subtypes A-D, F-H, J, K; subtype A is
further split into A1 and A2, and subtype F is divided into
F1 and F2),
(2) HIV-1 group N,
(3) HIV-1 group O,

The N value, the only parameter used in this method,
could be set empirically according to the N values listed in
the Results section.

(4) HIV-2 (subtypes A, B, G),
(5) SIV-CPZ, and SIV-SMM

Our method thus provides an alternative way of constructing sequence trees. It is helpful in tracking sequence
information embedded in ambiguous alignment regions.
In addition, the possibility of comparing sequences of varied lengths also suggests its direct use in detecting
sequence recombinants. Finally, the similarity blocks
found by this method could also be used as the anchor
points for those similarity-block-based alignment programs to refine the quality of the alignment.

Conclusion
The N-local-decoding method has shown its satisfactory
applications in HIV/SIV subtyping. The deduced classifications are in good agreement with our best taxonomic
knowledge, even for non-coding LTR regions that are not
tractable by regular alignment methods due to frequent
duplications/insertions/deletions. However, its application is not limited in HIV/SIV subtyping. In general, the
advantages of this method are:
1) It generates sequence dissimilarity matrices without
requiring sequence alignments.
2) It has only one user-specified parameter (N: the order
of the site neighborhoods).
3) It is fast.
Thus the N-local-decoding method provides a promising
approach to the rapid construction of trees without a
time-consuming step of aligning sequences.

Methods
Sequences
Our test sequences include 59 HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and 7 SIV (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus)
non-recombinant full length genome sequences and 4
incomplete non-recombinant HIV-2 sequences. Recombinants and non-recombinants are very well defined
sequences [23]. These 66 complete genome sequences
ranging in length from 8555 to 11443 nucleotides cover
the following clades:

Four incomplete genome sequences are obtained from
HIV-2 subtypes C, D, E, F, with lengths varying from 771
to 781 nucleotides, that cover about half of gag region.
Thus those well-characterized 70 sequences, representing
different HIV/SIV groups, sub-groups, subtypes, and subsubtypes, are good samples of the genetic variation of the
HIV/SIV world. These sequences can be retrieved from the
Los Alamos HIV sequence database [24]. Their accession
numbers are given in Figure 1. The sequence files are also
available from [16].
Algorithm
The sequence data described above were analysed using
the method introduced in [7,8], which we call «local
decoding of order N» of a sequence. Basically, the aim of
the method is to find local similarities between (and
within) the sequences of an input set. The input consists
of a set of non-aligned sequences or a single sequence. In
the input, any site of a sequence is occupied by a letter
(typically a base or an amino acid). In the output, every
site is occupied by an identifier that carries information
about the letter and its neighborhood. The details of this
method are described below.

A sequence S consists of letters S1...Si... with i running
from 1 to |S|, the length of the sequence. Let N be a chosen integer parameter, which determines the size of neighborhoods to be considered. Consider the set of all
overlapping words of length N (step 1) in the sequence S.
Given a site (i.e. an integer i with 1 ≤ i ≤ |S|), consider the
set of words that cover this site. Two sites are said to be
«directly related» if they appear at the same position in
two occurrences of the same word of length N (see example below). It is easy to see that two directly related sites
have to be occupied by the same letter. Note that two sites
may not be directly related but each of them may be
directly related to a third site. More generally, two sites are
said to be «related» (not necessarily directly) if they are
linked by a chain of direct relations. In mathematical terminology, we consider the transitive closure of the direct
relation. One can show that any two (even not directly)
related sites are also occupied by the same letter. Finally,
one obtains a decomposition of the set of all sites into dis-

(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:1

joint classes (so called «N-classes»), each class being
defined to be a maximal subset of sites that are pairwise
related. This decomposition is always finer than (or the
same as) the decomposition of sites into classes of sites
occupied by a same letter. In this sense, local decodings of
sequences are more informative. This method can be
extended to a set of sequences. A site is then labelled by a
pair (sequence name, position).
Using this method, we have re-written a set of HIV
sequences in a larger alphabet. A «letter» of the new alphabet at a given site of the sequences, can be for instance
«A215» where «A» is the letter in the input sequence at this
site, and where A215 is the N-class identifier used to distinguish «related sites» (i.e. all sites carrying the symbol
«A215») from non-related sites. This re-writing depends
only on the choice of the integer parameter N. In addition,
the re-writing of a set of sequences depends also on this
sequence set itself, and could be changed if sequences are
added or removed. In other words, «relatedness» is not an
intrinsic property of sites.
An example
Figure 6a shows three sequences, named seq1, seq2, seq3,
of length 30 nt, 20 nt, 20 nt, respectively. We choose N =
5. Consider the site at position 11 (letter T) in seq1. We
say it is related with the site at position 5 in seq2, and with
sites at positions 5 and 12 in seq3. Indeed, the site
(seq1,11) is at position 1 in the word TGGAC. The same is
true for (seq2,5) and (seq3,12). According to our «local
decoding of order N» definition, these three sites are
directly related to each other. The fourth site (seq3,5) is
directly related to (seq2,5), because (seq3,5) and (seq2,5)
are both at position 5 in the word CACTT. Consequently,
the four sites (occupied by the letter T) are all pairwise
related. They correspond to class_8 in Figure 6b and are
identified by T3 in the output sequences (Fig. 6c).

Figure 6b shows all classes of sites containing at least two
members, and Figure 6c shows the output of the program
based on the algorithm described in [8]. Each site in the
original sequences is replaced by the identifier of the Nclass to which the site belongs. As mentioned above, the
identifier consists of the letter occupying the site in the
original sequence, followed by a number.
Similarity and dissimilarity between sequences
Among many possibilities of defining a similarity
between sequences, we choose the one described in [8]. In
the program output (Fig. 6c), every site in the compared
sequences gets occupied by an identifier. We need an extra
notation here and denote by |w|x the number of occurrences of an identifier x in any sequence (w). Let us first
introduce a similarity score between two sequences u and
v. Each identifier x could occur in any alignment (align-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/1

ments are not used by our method) of u and v in at most
min(|u|x,|v|x), that is the smallest number of occurrences
of x in the two sequences u and v. Adding up this number
over all identifiers gives an upper bound of the maximum
number of possible matches between u and v (Fig. 6d).
Finally, we normalize the obtained similarity by dividing
it by the length of the shorter sequence (this makes it possible to subtype short sequence parts together with complete sequences, see Results first section). It is then
straightforward to obtain a dissimilarity score, that is 1
minus the normalized similarity (Fig. 6e). Figure 6d–e
outlines the method for calculating the dissimilarity
matrix between the three compared sequences re-written
in Figure 6c, by using the N-local decoding method. For
instance, when comparing seq1 and seq2, the sum of all
the min(|u|x,|v|x) equals 5, so that the corresponding dissimilarity is 1 - (5/20) = 0.75 (Fig. 6e). Here, the identifiers that correspond to classes containing only one site
have been omitted, since they cannot contribute to the
similarity (Fig. 6c).
Computational programs used in this study
A program implementing the N-local decoding method
was used for constructing HIV/SIV trees. It reads a set of
FASTA input sequences, and generates a tree based on the
dissimilarity matrix described above. This program is
available from [16]. A more recent program [8] written in
C, and the supplementary material are available upon
request from GD (address in the title page).

Other programs used in this paper are: CLUSTAL-W (version 1.8 June 1999) [18], DIALIGN-2.2.1 [19] and
PHYLIP [25]. Some of these programs have been used to
compute the alignment-based dissimilarity matrices from
which the trees have been constructed for Figure 3 (CLUSTAL-W) and for Figure 4 (DIALIGN-2.2.1).
Computing bootstrap values over trees
To assess the reliability of the trees computed from the
dissimilarity matrices, we use a bootstrapping procedure
similar to the one proposed in [26] which proceeds by
resampling the columns of an alignment. Though we do
not deal with an alignment but just a set of local decoded
sequences, a very similar procedure can be applied here.
Practically, from the local decoded set of sequences, we
resample a given number of bootstrap replicates. These
replicates are the sets in which each sequence of the initial
local decoded set is replaced by a sequence of the same
length. This sequence is generated by concatenating randomly selected sites in the sequence of the initial set
(some positions can be selected more than once, others
never selected). For all the resampled sets of sequences we
compute dissimilarities and associated neighbor-joining
trees. Those trees are finally combined using the «con-

Figure 6
The «local decoding of order N» computing strategy
The «local decoding of order N» computing strategy. Figure 6a (top): Four (N = 5)-related sites (containing the letter
T) are taken from three input nucleotide sequences seq1, seq2 and seq3. Each of the four boxed sectors (2N - 1 = 9 letters in
length) has T at its center (in bold face type) and is identified by the sequence where it is situated and the position of T in this
sequence (that is seq1,11, seq2,5, seq3,5 and seq3,12, see Figure 6a bottom). Figure 6a (bottom): each 9-letters-long segment (identified by the corresponding site containing a T in bold face type) is displayed with the set of corresponding overlapping (step 1) words of length N = 5 underneath the corresponding site (boxed). The four sites are 5-related; seq1,11, seq2,5
and seq3,12, are directly 5-related by TGGAC (in bold face type) at the position 1; seq1,11 and seq3,12 are also directly 5related by CTGGA at the position 2; seq3,5 is directly 5-related with only seq2,5 by CACTT at the position 5, so that it is connected by seq2,5 with the other two sites. Figure 6b: the symbols that identify each class containing at least two sites, are
shown together with the segments covered by the overlapping 5-words that lie over the letter (boxed). Figure 6c: the rewritten sequences generated by the program. The identifiers corresponding to classes containing only one site are only represented by their corresponding letter in the input sequence; in fact, they cannot contribute to calculating the similarities
between pairwise compared re-written sequences. Figure 6d: the double-entry table for constructing a pairwise distance
matrix between the three sequences (re-written in figure 6c). Each class identifier with at least two sites is indicated in the
corresponding row. For each row and for each of the three sequences that label the three columns, the table gives the number
of sites of this N-class that appear in the sequence. Figure 6e: similarity matrix and the corresponding normalized dissimilarity
matrix (see text) for the three sequences.

Authors' contributions
The local decoding algorithm and the program code were
developed by GD. LD and MP calculated the dissimilarity
matrix and implemented the user interface. IL initiated
and led the application to HIV/SIV on the basis of his previous work on the subject. IL wrote the manuscript
together with AG, CD and MZ. AG and CD contributed
mainly to the section about the method, while MZ played
an important role in the presentation and discussions of
biological aspects of the paper. All authors read and
approved the final manuscript.

Acknowledgements
We thank Alain Hénaut, Bernard Prum and Jean-Loup Risler for helpful discussions. In particular, we owe the initial idea of using the N-local-decoding
method for a classification without alignment to Alain Hénaut. This work
was supported by the «programme inter-EPST Bio-informatique 2001».
