Abstract
Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are essential for the manufacture of fermented dairy products. Studies
on the physiology, biochemistry and genetics of these microorganisms over the last century have
contributed considerably to the improvement of fermentation processes and have resulted in
better and safer products. Nevertheless, the potential of LAB is far from being maximized. The
sophistication of biotechnologies and the availability of complete genome sequences have opened
the door to the metabolic engineering of LAB. In this regard, the recent publication of the complete
genome sequences of two Streptococcus thermophilus strains will provide a key tool to facilitate the
genetic manipulation of this important dairy species.

Introduction
The souring of milk by microorganisms has been used for
thousand of years as a natural preservation procedure [1].
The method was domesticated to manufacture man-made
edible fermented products such as cheese, which appeared
in the human diet some 8,000–10,000 years ago. However, up to the beginning of the 20th century, milk fermentation was by no means a controlled process, and the
search for improvements was strictly empiric and based
on trial and error.
The discovery and characterization of lactic acid bacteria
(LAB) has tremendously modified the way fermented
milk products are made. Considerable efforts have been
devoted over the last fifty years to increase our knowledge
about the genetics, biochemistry, and physiology of LAB.
In addition to enhancing our understanding of microbial
life, these studies have allowed dairy microbiologists and
cheesemakers to select better strains and improve the productivity, quality, and safety of the final products. The

characterization of LAB has promoted the rational development of blends of defined bacterial strains, now known
as starter cultures, which are increasingly replacing the
undefined blends traditionally used by the dairy industry.
This strategy makes it easier to control acid production
and, to some extent, phage problems. Unfortunately, it is
also widely perceived that this approach reduces the much
sought-after rich, complex flavour of fermented products
made with undefined cultures. Thus, the search for LAB
strains that produce characteristic aroma and flavours
remains an attractive challenge for the dairy industry.
The increasing awareness of the population of the importance of a healthy diet has led scientists to revisit the century-old hypothesis that some specific fermented dairy
products may provide health benefits. A plethora of studies are underway to evaluate this concept and to improve
the health benefits of LAB. Also, the long history of the
safe use of these bacteria has made them very attractive
candidates as vaccine delivery vehicles [2,3]. Lastly,

thanks to their relatively small genome and simple metabolism, LAB can be exploited as food-grade cell factories to
produce molecules of industrial and therapeutic interest.
To meet some of these challenges and promises, it became
apparent that metabolic engineering was the best
approach. Owing to the industrial interest, the sound
knowledge of its genetic and the availability of genetic
tools, metabolic engineering of LAB has been carried out
mainly with Lactococcus lactis. The publication of the complete genome sequence of L. lactis in 2001 [4] was a boost
to speed up achievements in rerouting metabolic fluxes
with this LAB. For instances, it became possible to increase
the production of diacetyl and to transform this mesophilic bacterium from homolactic fermenter to
homoalanine fermenter. The innovative production of
vitamins by L. lactis via genetic manipulation [5,6] is a
convincing example of how metabolic engineering of LAB
can be beneficial for consumers. A number of reviews [712] provide a more comprehensive discussion of the metabolic engineering of L. lactis.
Recently, the complete genome sequence of two Streptococcus thermophilus strains were published [13] and a third
one is nearing completion [14]. S. thermophilus is a thermophilic LAB species widely used for the manufacture of
yogurt and cheeses that require elevated cooking temperatures such as Swiss and Italian types. The availability of
these genome sequences will make it possible to apply
genomic-related analytic methods such as functional and
comparative genomics, microarray technologies, proteomics, and bioinformatics to this species. These
genomic-based technologies will undoubtedly accelerate
the metabolic engineering of S. thermophilus, which is still
at its infancy. We will briefly discuss current studies that
will greatly benefit from these S. thermophilus genomic
sequences: food-grade vectors, optimization of lactose
metabolism and exopolysaccharide (EPS) production,
and resistance to bacteriophages.

Discussion
Food-grade vectors
Metabolic engineering often involves inactivation or overexpression of relevant chromosomal genes or stringent
control of an extrachromosomal foreign gene borne by a
plasmid artificially introduced into the host. Plasmids
thus play a central role in these studies because they are
the primary vehicles used to manipulate target DNA
sequences. However, these extrachromosomal genetic elements are naturally but infrequently observed in S. thermophilus strains[15].

Understandably, very few cloning tools are at hand, and
those that are available are based on similar replication
machinery. This lack of diversity poses significant prob-

lems for many genetic studies. While several types of
transformation methods have been developed to introduce foreign DNA into S. thermophilus, an efficient, stable,
food grade expression system is still lacking. The recent
discovery of a novel theta-type replicating plasmid [15] as
well as suitable selection markers effective in S. thermophilus, such as galactokinase [16] and alpha-galactosidase [17], suggest that help is on the way. The complete S.
thermophilus genome sequences also provide crucial information on transcription and translation initiation signals
and the codon usage of this bacterium. This may help in
the design of efficient expression systems.
Lactose metabolism
The ability of S. thermophilus to rapidly take up and metabolize lactose is crucial in several fermentation processes.
While S. thermophilus readily metabolizes the glucose moiety of lactose, it is unable to metabolize galactose, which
is expelled into the external medium. The presence of
galactose in yogurt and other dairy products might be
unwanted for different reasons. Notably, galactose is
poorly metabolized by humans and may cause, under certain conditions, health problems [18,19]. The release of
galactose by S. thermophilus results either from poor
expression of the gal operon [20] or inefficient translation
of the galK gene coding for galactokinase [16,21]. The
finding that the inability to grow on galactose was a consequence of poor galK translation was first suggested by a
comparative analysis of the S. thermophilus gal-lac operons
with the homologous genes from the phylogenetically
related oral bacterium Streptococcus salivarius. This is a convincing example of how comparative genome analysis
may help to decipher specific metabolic pathways of LAB.
While the introduction of a functional extrachromosomal
S. salivarius galK allele in S. thermophilus allows it to grow
on galactose, it does not prevent the expulsion of galactose during growth on lactose [16]. In this context, it is
noteworthy that 10% of S. thermophilus genes are not functional (pseudogenes) and that one third of these pseudogenes are dedicated to sugar metabolism [13]. It would be
interesting to determine whether reactivation of one or
several pseudogenes that were originally involved in sugar
metabolism could prevent or decrease galactose expulsion
during growth on lactose. In this context, the availability
of the complete sequence of the S. salivarius genome
would be welcome since many S. thermophilus pseudogenes involved in sugar transport are functional in S. salivarius [13].
Exopolysacharides
Some strains of S. thermophilus are widely used for the
commercial manufacture of yogurt because they produce
exopolysaccharides (EPS), which give a viscous texture to
the fermented dairy product. Other EPS-producing S. thermophilus strains can also enhance the functional proper-

ties of some cheeses such as Mozzarella. The organoleptic
properties of these products are largely due to the amount
and types of exopolysaccharide produced during the fermentation process. The yield and sugar constituents of
EPS are influenced by several factors and vary from strain
to strain [22]. S. thermophilus does not naturally produce
large amounts of EPS, which explains why considerable
efforts are being directed toward understanding the cellular mechanisms of EPS biosynthesis. Since low levels of
sugar precursors may limit EPS synthesis, a better understanding of S. thermophilus metabolic flux during sugar
metabolism may lead to new strategies to enhance EPS
production [22]. Levander et al. [23] showed that such
knowledge can be used to enhance EPS production in S.
thermophilus by metabolic engineering of central carbon
metabolism. Moreover, because EPS yields are growth
associated, efforts to increase production levels are likely
to require novel strategies to enhance biomass production. This task clearly requires a comprehensive view of
the cell machinery. The sequencing of a whole genome is
a mandatory step to achieve this goal. As our knowledge
of S. thermophilus continues to improve, novel EPS and/or
applications for EPS+ cultures are likely to emerge.
Phage resistance
Bacteriophages are the most significant cause of fermentation failures in the dairy industry worldwide. Dairy microbiologists have attempted for more than 70 years to
eliminate, or at least bring under better control, the bacteriophages that interfere with the manufacture of many fermented milk products [24]. The publication of the
complete genomes of two S. thermophilus hosts should
provide new insights in several areas of phage research.

The development of bacteriophage-insensitive S. thermophilus mutants is generally the first approach used to
transform a phage-sensitive strain into a phage-resistant
mutant, most likely following spontaneous chromosomal
mutation in the gene encoding the phage receptor.
Although progress has been made in identifying phage
proteins involved in S. thermophilus host recognition [25],
the identification of the phage receptors on the cell surface
has remained elusive. Based on the results of genome data
mining [26], a number of potential receptors can now be
experimentally verified.
At least eight complete S. thermophilus phage genomes are
now available [27,28]. Phage research has thus already
entered into the post-genomic era. Microarrays covering
the two main groups of S. thermophilus phages are already
available[29], meaning that it is now possible to design a
complete array containing host and phage genes to study
phage-host interactions on a novel and global scale during the infection process.

Conclusions
A thorough understanding of LAB metabolism and how it
is regulated by external stimuli is a prerequisite for maximizing the potential of LAB. The availability of complete
S. thermophilus genome sequences will obviously facilitate
our understanding of the metabolic potential of S. thermophilus. It will also make it easier to design rational
genetic manipulations of this important dairy bacterium
in order to produce added value cheeses and yogurts and
to use it as a cell factory. In addition, knowing the complete genome sequences should lead to the development
of new genetic tools that will provide insights into the
evolution of microbial communities, shifts in metabolism, and how each member adapts to the environmental
changes that occur during complex fermentation processes.
The exciting biotechnological developments in LAB and
studies that are already underway will benefit both consumers and the dairy industry. The availability of the complete S. thermophilus genome sequence have opened up
exciting, new possibilities that will build on an already
rich heritage.
