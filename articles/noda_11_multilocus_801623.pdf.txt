Abstract
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) was responsible for a worldwide pandemic
during the 1980s and 1990s; however, changes in the dominant lineage before and after this event remain
unknown. This study determined S. Enteritidis lineages before and after this pandemic event in Japan using
multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Thirty S. Enteritidis strains were collected in Japan between 1973 and 2004,
consisting of 27 human strains from individual episodes, a bovine strain, a liquid egg strain and an eggshell strain.
Strains showed nine phage types and 17 pulsed-field profiles with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. All strains had
homologous type 11 sequences without any nucleotide differences in seven housekeeping genes. These MLST
results suggest that S. Enteritidis with the diversities revealed by phage typing and pulsed-field profiling has a
highly clonal population. Although type 11 S. Enteritidis may exhibit both pleiotropic surface structure and pulsedfield type variation, it is likely to be a stable lineage derived from an ancestor before the 1980s and/or 1990s
pandemic in Japan.
Findings
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis
(S. Enteritidis) was responsible for a worldwide pandemic
during the 1980s and 1990s; however, changes in the
dominant lineage before and after this event remain
unknown. It is also difficult to explain why multiple clones
of S. Enteritidis (defined by phage types, (PTs)) infecting
chicken reproductive tissues emerged simultaneously in
geographically separate countries during this pandemic.
For example, PT 4 emerged in some European countries
during the late 1980s, including England and Wales [1],
France [2] and Germany [3], while PT 6 dominated Denmark [4]. PT 8, PT 13a and PT 13 were most common in
the USA [5] and in Japan, PT 1 and PT 4 were dominant
[6]. To understand the simultaneous emergence of this
pathogen, it is necessary to deduce whether these multiple
lineages co-instantaneously acquired the ability to colonize
chicken reproductive tissues or a single clone that

possessed this ability evolved into multiple lineages before
the pandemic.
Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) can be used to
accurately identify bacterial lineages [7,8]. The genetic distance between two strains can be quantitatively estimated
as allelic differences in the nucleotide sequences of housekeeping or virulent genes among bacterial strains [8].
MLST data have been used in evolutionary and population
analyses that estimate recombination and mutation rates
and also in the investigation of evolutionary relationships
among bacteria classified within the same genus [8]. Using
MLST, our study aimed to determine the lineages of
S. Enteritidis before and after the pandemic during the
1980s and/or 1990s in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan.
Salmonella strains used in this study are listed in
Table 1. Human strains from individual food-borne
disease outbreaks in 1973-1981 were isolated in the
Kanagawa Prefectural Institute of Public Health. Other
human strains (isolated from individual outbreaks), the
liquid egg strain and the eggshell strain were isolated
from different samples at the Fukuoka Institute of
Health and Environmental Sciences. The cattle strain

was provided by the Livestock Hygiene Service Center.
All strains were isolated in Japan between 1973 and
2004 (Table 1). We selected these strains to assess longterm alternation or rotation of S. Enteritidis genotypes.
The study has been approved by the Fukuoka Institute
of Health and Environmental Silences Ethics Committee.
Housekeeping genes, thrA (aspartokinase+homoserine
dehydrogenase), purE (phosphoribosylaminoimidazole carboxylase), sucA (alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase), hisD
(histidinol dehydrogenase), aroC (chorismate synthase),
hemD (uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase) and dnaN (DNA
polymerase III beta subunit) were used for MLST characterization. Each overnight-culture of the strains grown in
LB broth (Difco Laboratories, Sparks, MD., USA) was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min before the supernatant
was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in normal saline (1 ml) and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5 min. The

supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended
in 200 μl of 0.1 × TE buffer before being boiled for 10 min
and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was used as a template for the primary PCR. Primers
for the primary PCR were as follows: thrA F 5’-GTC ACG

Amplifications for all genes were carried out with 2 μl
DNA template, 2 μl of 2.5 mM (each) deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 5 μl of 5 × PrimeSTAR Buffer (5 mM Mg2+)
(Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan), 6.25 pmol of primer, and
0.625 U of PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase (Takara Bio
Inc.) in 25 μl reaction mixtures. Reaction conditions
involved 30 cycles of: (A) denaturation at 98°C for 10 s,
(B) primer annealing at 55°C for 10 s, and (C) extension at
72°C for 1 min. Reactions were performed using a PCR
Thermal Cycler SP TP 400 (Takara Shuzo, Co., Ltd.,
Kyoto, Japan). PCR products were purified using Microcon
(Millipore Corporation, Bedford, Mass., USA) and
sequenced using an ABI Prism BigDye Terminator v3.1

the complementary sense and antisense fragments were
aligned using the SeqManII program in the Lasergene
software package (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA).
Sequences were submitted to the MLST database website
(http://mlst.ucc.ie/) and assigned existing or novel allele
type numbers and sequence type numbers defined by the
database. Composite sequence types (STs) were assigned
based on the set of allele types derived from each of the
seven loci. Allele sequences for each strain were then concatenated in the order aroC - dnaN - hemD - hisD - purE
- sucA - thrA for a final composite length of 3,336 bp. Concatenated sequences were aligned using ClustalW software
[9] and a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the
neighbor-joining method (Center for Information Biology
and DNA Data Bank of Japan) to compare to other published STs. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using
NJplot (http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/njplot.html).
Phage typing was conducted on S. Enteritidis strains
recovered from samples in this study according to the
method of Ward et al. [10] at the National Institute of
Infectious Disease.
Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was conducted
as described in our previous report [11]. Strains were
considered different if variation in one or more DNA

Page 3 of 6

bands was observed. Using FPQuest Software (Bio-Rad
Laboratories Inc. Hercules, CA, USA), similarity and
cluster analyses were performed with Dice coefficients
of similarity and an unweighted pair group method
using average linkage, respectively.
Phage typing identified nine PTs (Table 1). PT 1 was
most dominant, while PT 3, PT 7 and PT 36 were individually detected in only one strain for each. For PFGE analysis, 30 strains generated 17 pulsed-field profiles (PFPs)
after restriction with BlnI (Table 1 Figure 1). PFP 1 was
most dominant (11 strains), followed by PFP 10 (three
strains). All other PFPs were only found in a single strain.
S. Enteritidis with PFP 1 consisted of PT 1, PT 4, PT 14b
and PT 36 strains.
MLST analysis did not detect any nucleotide differences among the 30 S. Enteritidis strains for seven genes
(thrA: 501 bp, pure: 399 bp, sucA: 501 bp, hisD: 501 bp,
aroC: 501 bp, hemD: 432 bp, and dnaN: 501 bp). All
strains were characterized as ST 11 according to the
MLST database (Table 1). The sequences of ST 11 are
available in the MLST database http://mlst.ucc.ie/. ST
11 consisted of strains with variable PTs and PFPs.
According to concatenated sequences analysis, ST 11
belonged to a clade that consisted of ST 11, ST 136,
and ST 183 (Figure 2).
For the first reported time, our study characterized all
tested S. Enteritidis strains between 1973 and 2004 as a
single ST (ST 11) and several PTs and PFPs. Two main
interpretations of these results include: (A) Rabsch and
colleagues speculated that S. Enteritidis acquired a niche
in chicken reproductive tissues before the 1980s [12];
(B) disease-associated S. Enteritidis had a higher clonal
population in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan. These hypotheses are further discussed below.
Persistence of S. Enteritidis clonality in Japan supports
the idea that the ST 11 lineage had possibly acquired a
niche within chicken reproductive organs before the pandemics (1980s and 1990s). It is reported that the process
of chicken oviduct colonization of S. Enteritidis is complex
and depends on many factors including fimbriae, flagellae,
lipopolysaccharide, cell wall structure and stress tolerance
[13]. Until now, it has not been clear as to why S. Enteritidis is specifically implicated in egg contamination [14].
Housekeeping genes potentially play a less important roll
in chicken oviduct colonization than genes of the abovementioned factors. However, the absence of changes in
the housekeeping genes suggests that the ST11 lineage
survived without any substantial genetic changes being
produced by the fundamental processes of mutation,
recombination, selection, drift, and migration [15]. Insufficient information was available for strains isolated before
the pandemic because only three isolates were tested.
Although ST 11 S. Enteritidis may produce some strain
variation in pleiotropic surface structures [16] defined by

Figure 1 Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis of fingerprints from genetically defined Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar
Enteritidis strains. Numbers on the right of the dendrogram indicate pulsed-field profiles (PFPs) and the phage types (PTs) associated with each
PFP. The scale indicates the percentage similarity, as determined using Dice coefficients. PFPs 1 and 10 include some strains. The center
diagrams are the PFPs of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Enteritidis strains with BlnI digestion.

PTs (such as PT 1, 3, 4, 6a, 7, 9, 14b, and 36) and genotypes defined by PFPs, it is likely to be a stable lineage that
was derived from an ancestor before the pandemic in
Japan. Our study therefore potentially supports the speculative assumptions made by Rabsch et al. [12].
Our study also suggested that food-borne diseaseassociated S. Enteritidis has a relatively higher clonal
population than other Salmonella. In another study, 81
isolates of S. Newport from humans, food animals, and
retail foods showed 12 STs [17], while in our present
study, S. Enteritidis populations showed a single ST lineage. As all typing systems are influenced by the tested
population [18], we can only discuss human and food
related strains in Fukuoka Prefecture, Japan, rather than
worldwide S. Enteritidis population genetics. However,
according to the international MLST database, among
the several distinct STs of S. Enteritidis in the world,
only ST 11 consists of human strains. These results

imply that human and food related-S. Enteritidis may be
a higher clonal population than S. Newport.
MLST is a useful method for analyzing the core genes
of pathogens that are of public health importance.
MLST can be used to analyze conserved core genes,
like housekeeping genes, which are universally conserved and provide fundamental genetic information
[19]. Our study has revealed that MLST is suitable for
evolutionary, basic relatedness or population studies,
however, in contrast with PFGE, this method is not
effective for epidemiological purposes. This is because
MLST cannot analyze a diverse range of Salmonella
strain specific genetic information that may be associated with niche adaptation. However, genetic variation
in pathogen populations is a major barrier to disease
control [20], and therefore, it is pertinent that we continue to survey the S. Enteritidis lineage in Japan using
MLST.
