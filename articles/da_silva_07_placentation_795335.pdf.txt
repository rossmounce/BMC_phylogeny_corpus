Abstract
A recent reassessment of the phylogenetic affinities of cetaceans makes it timely to compare their
placentation with that of the artiodactyls. We studied the placentae of two sympatric species of
dolphin from the Amazon River Basin, representing two distinct families. The umbilical cord
branched to supply a bilobed allantoic sac. Small blood vessels and smooth muscle bundles were
found within the stroma of the cord. Foci of squamous metaplasia occurred in the allanto-amnion
and allantochorion. The interhemal membrane of the placenta was of the epitheliochorial type.
Two different types of trophoblastic epithelium were seen. Most was of the simple columnar type
and indented by fetal capillaries. However, there were also areolar regions with tall columnar
trophoblast and these were more sparsely supplied with capillaries. The endometrium was well
vascularised and richly supplied with actively secreting glands. These findings are consistent with
the current view that Cetacea are nested within Artiodactyla as sister group to the hippopotamids.

Background
Little is known of placentation in whales [1]. Turner [2]
showed that they have epitheliochorial placentation. For
the baleen whales (suborder Mysticeti) our knowledge
has advanced little further [3], since available specimens
often have been in too poor condition for histology [4].
There is an excellent study of the early development of the
fetal membranes in the humpback whale [5], but it does
not extend to the establishment of the placenta. Rather
more is known about the toothed whales (suborder
Odontoceti), although based on descriptions of single
specimens of bottlenose dolphin [6], harbour porpoise

[7,8], killer whale [9], right whale dolphin [1] and Commerson's dolphin [1]. A brief account of placentation in
the Ganges river dolphin was based on examination of
four pregnant females [10].
Several lines of evidence point to a close relationship
between the mammalian orders Cetacea and Artiodactyla
(even-toed hoofed mammals). The argument is supported
by recent fossil evidence [11,12] as well as by molecular
phylogenetics, which has Cetacea nested within Artiodactyla and closely related to hippopotami [13-18]. This new
interpretation of the phylogenetic affinities of cetaceans

makes it interesting to re-examine their placentation and
ask what morphological transformations occurred in the
lineage of these aquatic mammals.
The Amazon River Basin is unusual in harbouring two
sympatric species of cetacean, the small gray dolphin or
tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis [19]) and the pink dolphin or
boto (Inia geoffrensis [20]). Features shared by Inia and
Sotalia include a reproductive cycle determined by the
annual flooding cycles of the Amazon. Calving takes place
when water levels are low or declining and fish more concentrated and susceptible to predation [21]. It is thought
that Inia entered South America in the Miocene, at which
time drainage of the Amazon Basin was towards the
Pacific [20]. Subsequent uprising of the Andes led to
clockwise reversal of the drainage of the Amazon. There
was also disruption of a much larger river system, resulting in the isolation of three populations of Inia in the Orinoco Basin, the Amazon Basin and, separated by a
waterfall barrier, in the Amazon tributaries of eastern
Bolivia [22]. Sotalia is thought to have entered the Amazon Basin more recently, from the Atlantic, becoming the
first non-platanistoid dolphin to live exclusively in fresh
water [23]. The speciation event that separated it from the
coastal S. guianensis has been dated to the Pliocene [23] or
early Pleistocene [24].
Information about reproduction in river dolphins is
sparse [21]. From time to time, individuals that have
drowned in fishermen's nets are brought to the National
Institute of Amazonian Research in Manaus and preserved
for different studies. We have examined the placentae of
these dolphins, which represent two distinct families: I.
geoffrensis is an Iniidae and S. fluviatilis is the only freshwater species of the marine dolphin family Delphinidae.

Methods
Three specimens of I. geoffrensis and one of S. fluviatilis
were available for study at the National Institute of Amazonian Research (Table 1). The uterus had been opened
and a large portion, with the placenta in situ and the fetus
attached by the cord, had been fixed in 10% formalin. An
additional specimen of I. geoffrensis from the Museum of
Anatomy, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of

Sao Paulo, consisted of fetus and membranes detached
from the uterus and fixed in formalin. After examining the
gross morphology, pieces of tissue were excised and processed for histology by standard methods. The paraffinembedded tissue was sectioned at 5 µm and stained with
haematoxylin and eosin (H.E.), Masson's triple stain, or
by the periodic acid Schiff reaction (PAS).

Results
Gross anatomy
Similar features were found for both species under discussion. The umbilical cord contained two arteries, two veins
and the urachus. After about 20 cm, the cord divided into
two branches each containing a single artery and vein. Pigmented tissue accretions of variable size and irregular distribution were found on the surface of the cord.

The amnion and allantois were translucent membranes
and appeared to be avascular. The allantois was the
thicker membrane and had a rugous surface. The two
membranes were juxtaposed over an extensive area, forming an allanto-amnion. The surface of the allanto-amnion
was covered with small accretions. In addition, accretions
occurred within the allantochorion and near its surface.
The uterine surface was trabecular in appearance. In most
places the placenta adhered closely to the uterine wall, but
there were areas where it readily detached. We also found
some areas of smooth chorionic membrane that were less
well vascularised, but were unable to ascertain their
extent.
Umbilical cord
The principal features of the cord are shown in Figure 1.
Most of the surface was covered by simple squamous epithelium. The surface accretions were plaques of squamous
metaplasia (Figure 2A). They were invested with stratified
squamous epithelium (Figure 2B) and sometimes contained macrophages. The urachus was lined with transitional epithelium. The major umbilical vessels, veins as
well as arteries, were endowed with vasa vasorum. The
stroma of the cord was supplied with small blood vessels
(Figure 2C). Smooth muscle bundles were seen within the
stroma at some distance from the tunica media of the
major vessels (Figure 2D) and running longitudinal to the
cord.
Fetal membranes
The amnion and allanto-amnion were avascular in both
species. The inner surface of the amnion was covered by
simple cuboidal epithelium, apparently with a brush border, and the outer surface with simple squamous epithelium (Figure 3A). Simple squamous epithelium also
covered the surface of the allanto-amnion. There were
large foci of squamous metaplasia at some places within

the allanto-amnion (Figure 3B). They were also found
near the chorioallantoic plate. They were invested with
simple cuboidal or squamous epithelium and housed
macrophages (Figure 3C).
Uterus and placenta
The interhemal membrane was of the epitheliochorial
type. The uterine trabeculae interdigitated with folds of
allantochorion that bore the fetal villi (Figure 4). Spaces
occurred between the trophoblast and uterine epithelium.
As discussed below, they likely were shrinkage artefacts.

The endometrium showed no sign of decidualisation. It
was well vascularised (Figure 5A) and richly supplied with
glands lined by actively secreting simple columnar epithelium. The cuboidal uterine epithelium was partly
indented by the maternal capillaries (Figure 5B).

The folds of allantochorion were invested with two different types of trophoblastic epithelium. Usually it was of
the simple low columnar type indented by the capillaries
with which it was so richly supplied (Figure 5C). We were
also able to observe areolar regions where the trophoblast
was of the tall columnar type with an apparent brush border (Figure 5D). These regions were more sparsely supplied with fetal capillaries. Columnar trophoblast also

lined the stretches of chorionic plate between the villous
trees (not shown). In some parts of the placenta the fetal
villi were short and during fixation had lost contact with
the maternal surface (Figure 3D).

Discussion
The features of the cord, including its bifurcation to supply a bilobed allantoic sac, are similar to those described
for other cetaceans [25]. The vascularisation of the stroma
is discussed at some length by Wislocki [7]. Bundles of
smooth muscle running longitudinally in the stroma of
the cord were also shown in Phocoena [7]. The allantoamnion was avascular in Inia and Sotalia as in Tursiops [6].
Small blood vessels were observed here in Phocoena [7].
Plaques of squamous metaplasia were found within and
near the allanto-amnion and allantochorion of Inia and
Sotalia, as has been described for other cetaceans [1].
Careful examination of the gravid uterus of Tursiops enabled Wislocki and Enders [6] to distinguish two regions of
the placenta that were thicker, better vascularised and
more closely adherent to the uterus. These were at the
tubal end of the left horn, which housed the fetus, and in
the right horn. Throughout most of the left horn the chorion was non-adherent and relatively avascular. As noted

we did find some areas of smooth chorionic membrane
with shorter villi and others that were less well vascularised, but were unable to ascertain their extent. In the
blocks of tissue taken for histology, the branched chorionic villi and endometrial folds are interlocked, but
spaces occur between the trophoblast and uterine epithelium. These appear in other studies [7,8] and it has been
suggested that they are not just shrinkage artefacts but
may represent natural spaces filled with embryotrophic
material. In another odontocete, Globicephala, the trophoblast appears closely apposed to the uterine epithelium, except in regions that were more clearly adapted for
embryotrophic nutrition. The latter are characterised by
columnar trophoblast enclosing spaces that contain uterine gland secretion [26]. As mentioned by Wislocki [7],
they tend to occur between the tips of the villi and the fundament of the crypts. In Inia and Sotalia, we found quite
extensive regions of branching villi lined by columnar trophoblast. Columnar epithelium was also found immediately beneath the chorionic plate.
In their brief description of Globicephala, Morton and Mulholland [26] mention that the maternal capillaries in
many crypt walls are intra-epithelial. This is borne out by
our own observations on Globicephala at the Mossman
Collection (University of Wisconsin Zoological Museum),

but was not seen in either Inia or Sotalia, although the
maternal capillaries did indent the epithelium. We agree
with Wislocki and Enders [6] that intraepithelial capillaries do not occur on the fetal side as had been suggested by
Ten Cate Hoedemaker [8].
In many odontocetes only the left ovary is active [27].
Consequently, the fetus is always found on the left side of
the uterus, although the placenta occupies both horns [6].
Unfortunately, we did not receive information about the
side of pregnancy in our specimens. This would have been
of interest, since Best and da Silva [21], found scars in
both ovaries of all four Inia that they examined. In the
franciscana, Pontoporia blainvillei, which is a close relative
of Inia [28,29], the right ovary was poorly developed [30].
In Sotalia fluviatilis ovarian scars were observed only in the
left ovary [21] although both ovaries are active in the
coastal species, S. guianensis [31].
Phylogenetic implications
Until quite recently mammalian phylogenetics dealt with
cladistic analysis of skeletal and dental characters. New
insights concerning relations between the various orders
have been provided by molecular tools, primarily analysis
of coding sequences in mitochondrial and nuclear genes
[13,15-18] often supplemented by molecular characters
such as short and long interspersed elements [14,32] that
are less subject to homoplasy. DNA sequence analysis
consistently finds Cetacea nested within Artiodactyla.
Therefore it is now common to consider cetaceans as part
of a wider ordinal clade called Cetartiodactyla. Secondly,
the whales and dolphins resolve as the sister group to hippopotamids. This contrasts with the traditional view that
hippopotamids are more closely related to pigs and tayassuids. The new arrangement receives robust support from
a meta-analysis for all living species of Cetartiodactyla
that incorporates morphological as well as molecular data
[33]. Recently it was shown that the foot bones of primitive Artiodactyla and early Cetacea exhibited shared,
derived characters or synapomorphies [11]. Finally,
renewed examination of the osteological characters of fossil and extant artiodactyls, including two early cetaceans,
found that pigs and tayassuids formed a monophyletic
group to the exclusion of hippopotamids, while cetaceans
and hippopotamuses formed another monophyletic
group [34].

These recent advances in phylogenetics have led to a reevaluation of fetal and placental membrane characters
[35-37]. Here we find that the placentas of Sotalia and Inia
share a common pattern similar to that described for
other cetaceans. It is apt to evaluate this pattern in relation
to concepts such as the newly erected superorder Laurasiatheria, the combined order Cetartiodactyla and perceived
relationships with the hippopotamids. Several characters

http://www.rbej.com/content/5/1/26

in the placentation of Cetartiodactyla are shared with two
other orders within Laurasiatheria, the horses and tapirs
(Perissodactyla) and the scaly anteaters (Pholidota).
These include the diffuse, villous and epitheliochorial placenta, and the presence of areolae [36,37]. Contrary to
common perceptions, recent cladistic analyses agree in
finding epitheliochorial placentation to be a derived state
and link it to another shared character, the birth of welldeveloped (precocial) young following a relatively long
period of gestation [35-40]. Indentation of trophoblast by
fetal capillaries, and uterine epithelium by maternal ones,
is common in these placentae and serves to reduce the diffusion distance [39]. Uterine gland secretions are an
important source of nutrients in epitheliochorial placentae [35]. Columnar trophoblast, which is able to absorb
these nutrients, is found in areolae and in the chorionic
fossae [41]. Vascularisation of the cord stroma seems to be
another common feature in Cetartiodactyla [7,25].
There are further resemblances in cetacean placentation to
that of pigs, tayassuids and hippopotami. However, some
characters are shared by hippopotami [42-44] and cetaceans, but not by pigs and tayassuids, in accordance with
the current view that hippopotamids are the sister group
to cetaceans. These features include a bilobed allantoic sac
occupying both horns of the uterus, paired umbilical
veins, and plaques of squamous metaplasia on the surface
of the cord and amnion. It is interesting that the hippopotamus placenta, like that of Tursiops [6], has several distinct areas. One, with intimate interdigitation of chorionic
villi and endometrial folds, is found mainly in the mesometrial region; the second is characterised by stunted
villi and thinner endometrium; finally there is some relatively avascular chorion at the poles of the chorion and
over the cervix.
In conclusion, placentation in Inia and Sotalia is similar to
what has been described for other toothed whales. The
limited variation in placental structures is consistent with
the view that Odontoceti are monophyletic and derived
from a small population of a common ancestral species
[32]. Secondly, the epitheliochorial placenta resembles
that of even-toed hoofed mammals [45] in accordance
with the current view that whales are nested within the
larger clade Cetartiodactyla [12]. Finally, some details of
the placenta and fetal membranes support the view that
whales are the sister group to hippopotamids [14].
