Abstract
Background: Mean phosphorous:nitrogen (P:N) ratios and relationships of P:N ratios with the growth rate of
organisms indicate a surprising similarity among and within microbial species, plants, and insect herbivores. To
reveal the cellular mechanisms underling this similarity, the macromolecular composition of seven
microorganisms and the effect of specific growth rate (SGR) on RNA:protein ratio, the number of ribosomes, and
peptide elongation rate (PER) were analyzed under different conditions of exponential growth.
Results: It was found that P:N ratios calculated from RNA and protein contents in these particular organisms
were in the same range as the mean ratios reported for diverse organisms and had similar positive relationships
with growth rate, consistent with the growth-rate hypothesis. The efficiency of protein synthesis in
microorganisms is estimated as the number of active ribosomes required for the incorporation of one amino acid
into the synthesized protein. This parameter is calculated as the SGR:PER ratio. Experimental and theoretical
evidence indicated that the requirement of ribosomes for protein synthesis is proportional to the RNA:protein
ratio. The constant of proportionality had the same values for all organisms, and was derived mechanistically from
the characteristics of the protein-synthesis machinery of the cell (the number of nucleotides per ribosome, the
average masses of nucleotides and amino acids, the fraction of ribosomal RNA in the total RNA, and the fraction
of active ribosomes). Impairment of the growth conditions decreased the RNA:protein ratio and increased the
overall efficiency of protein synthesis in the microorganisms.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that the decrease in RNA:protein and estimated P:N ratios with decrease in
the growth rate of the microorganism is a consequence of an increased overall efficiency of protein synthesis in
the cell resulting from activation of the general stress response and increased transcription of cellular
maintenance genes at the expense of growth related genes. The strong link between P:N stoichiometry,
RNA:protein ratio, ribosomal requirement for protein synthesis, and growth rate of microorganisms indicated by
the study could be used to characterize the N and P economy of complex ecosystems such as soils and the oceans.

Background
Although microorganisms are flexible in their nitrogen
(N) and phosphorus (P) content because of their ability to
store these nutrients, the mean P:N ratios and their variations indicate surprising similarity among and within
microbial species and even with plants and insect herbivores. For example, for marine phytoplankton, the variations in P:N ratio by mass are between 0.04 and 0.30, with
an overall average close to the Redfield ratio of 0.14 [1].
An average value of the ratio in terrestrial plants at their
natural field sites is in the range 0.07–0.08 [2-4]. Freshwater zooplankton and insect herbivores from terrestrial ecosystems also show similarity, with mean P:N ratios of 0.10
and 0.08 respectively [2].
Stoichiometric constraints are an important factor in the
regulation of microbial growth and in their interaction
with the environment. It has been proposed that an
increase in the growth rate requires an increase in protein
biosynthesis and, therefore an additional allocation of
cellular resources to the synthesis of ribosomes and ribosomal RNA, which comprise the main part of cellular RNA.
As a result of this allocation, the P:N ratio in the cell
increases. This idea is referred to as the growth-rate
hypothesis (GRH) [5-7]. In agreement with this hypothesis, the synthesis of rRNA in bacteria is maintained in proportion to the cell's requirement, and the number of rRNA
genes correlate with the rate at which phylogenetically
diverse bacteria respond to resource availability [8,9]. In
marine bacteria, species-specific growth rates may be estimated by measuring the rRNA content of the organisms
[10].
Ecological studies supporting the GRH usually consider
P:N stoichiometry, growth rate, and RNA content across
different organisms. A significant effect of the growth rate
of an individual unicellular organism on its macromolecular composition has also been well-documented [1116]. It was found that an impairment of growth in bacteria, yeast, algae, and fungi resulted in a decrease in their
total RNA, rRNA, protein contents, and RNA:protein ratio.
A direct proportionality between specific growth rate and
RNA:protein ratio was reported in Escherichia coli [11].
This finding is in agreement with the GRH, because N and
P in RNA and proteins dominate the total amounts of
these elements in cells of unicellular organisms [5]. We
can conclude from these studies that some molecular
mechanisms activated in the cells of an individual organism in response to environmental conditions may be
responsible for changes in P:N stoichiometry. At present,
however, these mechanisms are not clear. According to
studies of translational efficiency in vitro [17,18], the most
rapid bacterial growth demands maximally efficient ribosomes. Because the number of ribosomes is proportional
to cellular rRNA and RNA contents [19], the increased effi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/30

ciency of protein synthesis by ribosomes under the faster
growth reported in these studies may lead to a decrease in
the RNA:protein ratio in the cell. However, this view is not
in agreement with the GRH and is not supported by the
aforementioned studies of macromolecular composition.
In addition, studies of ribosomal, messenger, and transfer
RNA in yeast during a nutritional shift [20] show that,
although ribosomal RNA is significantly reduced after
growth inhibition, messenger and transfer RNA are
slightly increased [21]. These observations give indirect
support to the notion that synthesis of proteins in microorganisms under growth impairment may require fewer
ribosomes than under favorable growth, leading to a
decrease in RNA:protein and P:N ratios. This cellular regularity may underlie the effect of growth rate on RNA:protein and P:N ratios at the level of an individual organism.
The objective of this study was to investigate this hypothesis and to show that the cellular P:N ratio estimated from
the RNA:protein ratio reproduces mean P:N ratios
obtained experimentally for diverse microorganisms and
plants. We analyzed macromolecular composition,
number of active ribosomes, and peptide elongation rate
in a set of unicellular prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (bacteria, yeast, fungi, algae) as functions of their
growth rates. This information was used to calculate P:N
stoichiometry of unicellular organisms and the cellular
requirement of ribosomes for protein synthesis in different growth conditions.
It was found that the estimated P:N ratios derived from
the RNA and protein contents of these organisms were in
the same range as mean ratios reported for other, diverse
organisms. There was a direct proportionality between the
ribosomal requirement for protein production in the cell
and RNA:protein ratio, which may underlie this similarity
and the positive relationship of P:N ratio with the growth
rate of the microorganisms. A decrease in the ribosomal
requirement for protein production with an increase in
the growth rate could be explained in terms of the disposal soma theory.

Results
P:N ratios calculated from RNA and protein contents of
the unicellular organisms are in the same range as found in
the primary producers and have similar relationships with
growth rate
Experimental data for the analysis were obtained from
previous studies of macromolecular composition (protein
and RNA contents) of bacteria (E. coli, Streptomyces coelicolor, Mycobacterium bovis, Selenomonas ruminantium), budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae; two studies), fungi
(Neurospora crassa) and algae (Prototheca zopfii ) (Table 1).

The masses of RNA and proteins in the studies were determined under different conditions of exponential growth
characterized by a range of specific growth rates (SGR).
This parameter is a measure of the number of divisions
per cell per unit time. Between 1 and 12 growth conditions were considered in each study (Table 1), with SGR
varying from 0.029 to 1.73 per hour. The variation was
created by the use of different growth media. The P:N
ratios calculated from RNA and protein contents in the
studied organisms growing in such diverse conditions
were in the range 0.04–0.16, with an average value of 0.1
(Table 1). This range of values was similar to that of the
mean P:N ratios of the different organisms discussed in
the introduction. The different growth conditions analysed in the study resulted in changes in P:N ratios in the
microorganisms by factors of 5 and 4 only, whereas the
range of each nutrient varied by three orders of magnitude
(Table 1, columns 5–10). Smaller changes in P:N ratio at
the organism level may be demonstrated by expressing the
growth rate of the organisms as the relative growth rate
(RGR). This parameter is often used in ecological studies
[7], and is calculated as

In all organisms, except the algae P. zopfii and S. ruminantium ,an increase in growth was accompanied by a linear
increase in RNA:protein ratio (Figure 2) and P:N ratio
(Figure 1). The ratios in P. zopfii showed no correlation
with growth (Table 2), possibly because the RNA:protein
ratio varied only within the narrow range 0.22–0.28,
which corresponds to 0.09–0.13 for the P:N ratio. The
study of S. ruminantium included only three growth conditions, and, similarly to P. zopfii ,the P:N ratio of the
organism varied only slightly (from 0.072 to 0.081). In
agreement with the GRH, the P:N ratio calculated from
RNA and protein contents increased with an increase in
the specific growth rate of the unicellular organism. The
rate of increase in P:N ratio per unit of RGR, which was
estimated as the slope of the regression line (Table 2), varied among the unicellular organisms, from 0.06 in E. coli
to 0.28 in S. coelicolor. The intercept of the regression line
on the ordinate also varied among organisms, even
between different strains of S. cerevisiae. Considering the
strong correlations between P:N ratios and RGR for most
organisms, demonstrated by Figure 1, the regression intercepts may characterize the P:N ratios required to maintain
organisms in the stationary state.

RGR = SGR/SGRmax,
where SGRmax is the maximum SGR of the organism in the
study. Figure 1 and Table 2 illustrate the effect of RGR on
P:N ratio.

RNA:protein ratio using a common constant characterising
protein synthesis machinery in the cell
The mass of ribosomal RNA per cell (mrRNA) measured in
the studies of E. coli, S. coelicolor, M. bovis, S. cerevisiae (two
studies), and N. crassa (Table 3) allowed us to estimate the
cellular requirement of ribosomes for protein synthesis in
the organisms as functions of the growth conditions by
calculating the number of ribosomes and the peptide
elongation rate (PER). By definition, PER is the number of
amino acids incorporated into the peptide chain per second by one active ribosome. Therefore, it was calculated
as the rate of protein synthesis in the cell expressed in
amino acids per second divided by the number of active
ribosomes, or algebraically as

(1)

PER = naa × SGR/(FRa× nR),

where FRa is the fraction of active ribosomes (involved in
protein synthesis), naa is the cellular protein content
expressed in amino-acid equivalents, SGR is the specific

To characterize the cellular requirement of ribosomes for
protein synthesis under different growth conditions, we
calculated the increase in SGR per unit increase in PER, i.e.
the ratio SGR:PER (RSGR:PER). From equation 1, the following expression for this ratio was obtained:
(3)

RSGR:PER = (FRa× nR)/naa

According to this equation, RSGR:PER measures the number
of ribosomes in the cell required to incorporate one
amino acid into a new protein. The reciprocal of this
parameter (PER:SGR) is a measure of how efficiently synthesized ribosomes are used in the cell for protein production. In addition to the intrinsic translational efficiency of
ribosomes, which may be estimated by studies of translation in vitro [22,23], this parameter also includes the
effects of cellular environment on the stability of mRNA,
proteins and ribosomes. Therefore, the SGR:PER ratio
gives an indirect estimate of the overall efficiency of cellular protein synthesis in vivo. It makes the parameter more
suitable for estimating the effect of growth conditions on
the efficiency of protein-production machinery of the
microorganism. Values of RSGR:PER in the microorganisms
calculated in the studies are summarized in Table 3. Figure
3 presents experimental evidence for a close correlation
(R2 = 0.98) between the values of RSGR:PER, which characterizes the ribosomal requirement for protein production,
and the RNA:protein ratio (RRNA:Pr). Moreover, this relationship has the same coefficient of proportionality for all
organisms and growth conditions, referred to below as the
C value.
Next we considered which cellular parameters are responsible for the identified proportional relationship between
RSGR:PER and the RNA:protein ratio. Substitution of equation 2 into equation 3 gives

• nnuclR. The transcripts of ribosomal subunits also have
high sequence similarity. The number of nucleotides comprising the ribosome, parameter nnuclR, is rather conservative across a wide range of species. Only small differences
in the size of rRNA in different bacteria have been
reported [24]. The 16S rRNA varies between 1487 bp for
the cyanobacterium Anacystics nidulans and 1549 bp for
Bacillus subtilis. The size of the 23S rRNAs is in the range
2876 bp for A. nidulans to 3122 bp for Mycobacterium leprae. The 5S rRNAs are quite small, with an average size of
120 bp and a range extending from 107 bp in Mycoplasma
capricolum to 123 bp in Deinococcus radiodurans. In summary, the average value for nnuclR is 4632 nucleotides.
• FrRNA. It is believed that the rRNA fraction of total RNA
is independent of the growth rate. Specifically, it was
shown that in E. coli, synthesis of rRNA and tRNA are controlled by similar promoters, so that rRNA and tRNA represent 86% and 14%, respectively, of total stable RNA
[25]. Although there are differences between eukaryotic
and bacterial ribosomes in RNA sequences and in structure (bacterial ribosomes have two ribosomal RNA molecules, whereas eukaryotes have three), studies of the
amount of ribosomal and total RNA in yeast showed that
rRNA constituted about 85% of total RNA. This fraction
decreased only slightly (to about 83%) with decreasing
growth rate [13]. The calculation of rRNA as a fraction of
total RNA in the organisms under consideration (Table 3,
rows 4 and 5) also shows small variation in this parameter
(from 0.82 to 0.86) with an average value of 0.85.
• FRa. A messenger RNA that is being actively translated
usually has multiple ribosomes forming a polysome.
Translationally inactive mRNAs are often sequestered in
messenger ribonucleoprotein particles or associated with
a single ribosome. According to experimental observations, the number of ribosomes in the cell is approximately one order of magnitude greater than the number
of RNA molecules, but only 10–20% is free and available
to initiate translation. The remaining ribosomes are
engaged in translation and form polysomes [26]. It is not
clear at present how the number of active ribosomes
depends on growth conditions and the specific organism.
Considering the fact that all other parameters in equation
7 are constants and C is constant, the fraction of active
ribosome FRa may not vary significantly among organisms
and growth conditions. If we take the number of free
ribosomes to equal 15% (between 10 and 20%) then the
fraction of active ribosomes will be 0.85.
The C value was calculated by substituting estimated values of the parameters Mnucl, Maa, nnuclR, FrRNA, FRa in equation 7. The value of C, rounded to the nearest 1000, was
18,000. This number is close to the C value (19,630)
obtained by regressing RRNA:Pr against RSGR:PER (Figure 3).

In conclusion, the cellular requirement of ribosomes for
protein production in microorganisms may be estimated
as the RNA:protein ratio using a general constant to characterise protein-synthesis machinery in the cell. This constant is a function of the number of nucleotides per
ribosome, the fraction of ribosomal RNA in total RNA, the
fraction of active ribosomes in the cell, and the average
mass of nucleotide and amino acid.
Considering the proportionality between RSGR:PER and
RRNA:Pr, the ratios PER:SGR and RNA:protein will be also
proportional. Therefore, the overall efficiency of protein
production in the microorganisms is proportional to
RNA:protein. In conclusion, the effect of growth rate on
RNA:protein and P:N ratios actually reproduced and,
probably, followed the effect of growth rate on the overall
efficiency of protein production in the microorganisms.

Discussion
Explaining the similarity of RNA:protein and P:N ratios in
diverse organisms
According to equation 6 and Figure 3, the cellular requirement of ribosomes for protein synthesis in both prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes may be calculated from the
RNA:protein ratio using the same constant for different
unicellular organisms. This emphasizes the similarity in
the protein synthesis machinery of different unicellular
organisms. Specifically, parameters such as the number of
nucleotides per ribosome, the average masses of nucleotides and amino acids, the fraction of ribosomal RNA in
total RNA, and the fraction of active ribosomes are similar
in unicellular organisms. Conservation of these parameters is consistent with the conservative function of ribosomes. The basic functions of initiation, elongation, and
termination in ribosomes of bacteria closely resemble
those of eukaryotes. A conservative core of proteins and
genes is responsible for the basic "housekeeping" functions of the cell including metabolism, translation, DNA
replication and repair, and RNA processing [30,31]. This
implies a similarity in genomic mechanisms that regulate
growth and protein synthesis of organisms in response to
environmental changes and, thus, their RNA:protein and
P:N stoichiometry. The actual biomass P:N ratio in organisms is not necessarily equal to the P:N ratio derived from
RNA and protein contents. The accumulation of nutrients
when there is an excess supply, their reuse, and some
other processes may cause significant variation in actual
biomass P:N ratios. Averaging the ratios for the organisms
among diverse environmental conditions, however,
decreases the variation and causes the P:N values to
approach cellular growth requirements. It may explain
why mean P:N ratios of the microbial species and plants
reviewed in the introduction are rather similar to the P: N
ratios calculated from RNA and protein contents of the
unicellular organism.

Although taking averages of many species reduces N and
P variance, the estimation of P:N ratios from RNA:protein
for some specific organisms and growth conditions may
be invalid. Microorganisms in the studies were considered
under conditions of balanced growth or glucose limitation (in the case of S. ruminantium). Additional studies are
needed to investigate if N and P limitations have a similar
effect on the efficiency of protein synthesis, and RNA:protein and P:N ratios. Although the P:N concentrations of
many heterotrophic organisms are largely independent of
P:N concentrations in the growth media [7], in some
microorganisms luxury consumption of nutrients can
occur, which could affect the relationships considered in
the paper [32]. The relationships for phototrophs and
nitrogen-fixing organisms may be even more problematical. Phototrophs have large variations in P:N related to the
contents of rubisco and pigments, which vary with light
and nutrient supply. In nitrogen-fixing organisms, a large
proportion of protein is devoted to nitrogen fixation.
Therefore, there is a need for further studies in which both
RNA:protein contents and P:N ratios are measured
directly and a broader range of organisms and conditions
are considered.
Regulation of the cellular efficiency of protein synthesis,
RNA:protein and P:N ratios by trade-off between growth
and maintenance
We suggest that the decrease in the cellular requirement of
ribosomes for protein production with the increase in cell
growth rate reported in this paper may be explained by the
disposable soma theory. According to this theory, the
metabolic resources are limited in any one organism and
may be divided between two main activities, growth/
reproduction and maintenance/survival [33,34]. Cellular
growth requires a large expenditure of biosynthetic energy
in all organisms. Actively growing cells of prokaryotes and
low eukaryotes expend around 80% of total nuclear transcription effort in the assembly of translational machinery. About 10% of cell proteins are ribosomal, which are
mainly involved in stabilization of rRNAs, thereby facilitating the catalytic roles of ribosomes [35,36]. Thus,
microbial cells strictly control ribosome biogenesis by
quickly adjusting it to particular nutritional conditions
[35,37-39]. This adjustment occurs not only by a decrease
or an increase of rRNA transcription, but also by degradation of ribosomes under conditions of bacterial starvation, and by formation of 100S ribosome dimers, which
are believed to be a storage form for ribosomes in the stationary state. As stated in the introduction and demonstrated in this study, the mass of total RNA and rRNA in
organisms decreases when growth conditions are
impaired. Given the disposable soma theory, it may be
hypothesized that the reduction of these synthetic efforts
coincides with the redirection of metabolic activity in cells
from replication to maintenance, and that this redirection

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/30

is the main reason for a decrease in the RNA:protein and
P:N ratios. It is known that, although the activity of
"housekeeping" genes involved in ribosome production
and other processes related to proliferation decreases in
adverse growth conditions, the activity of genes encoding
general stress proteins involved in cellular maintenance
increases. A long line of evidence supports redirection of
this activity in bacteria [40,41].
In conclusion, a stressful environment causes unicellular
organisms to conserve cellular resources by directing them
into maintenance instead of reproduction. As a result, the
decrease in cellular RNA production at slow growth will
coincide with a more efficient use of cellular components
including ribosomes and synthesized proteins. In combination, these processes decrease the requirement of ribosomes for protein production with decrease in growth rate
and, as a result, decrease RNA:protein and P:N ratios.
RNA:protein ratio as a characteristic of P:N stoichiometry
of unicellular organisms and their interaction with the
environment
According to the GRH, the main reasons for the positive
correlation between P:N stoichiometry of organisms and
their growth rate lie in changes in the allocation of cellular
resources to the synthesis of ribosomes and ribosomal
RNA [6,7]. According to our study, this ecologically
important phenomenon may result not only from
changes in the production of rRNA, but also from changes
in the overall efficiency of protein synthesis. Our findings
support the view that, when growth of unicellular organisms is restricted, there is a decrease in the number of
ribosomes required to incorporate one amino acid into
synthesized protein. These changes decrease RNA:protein
ratio in the cell and, therefore, may be responsible for the
decrease in P:N stoichiometry of the organism after
growth impairment. In support of this mechanism, the
P:N ratios calculated from RNA and protein contents in
the studied unicellular organisms growing in very diverse
conditions were in the same range as the mean ratios
reported for different microorganisms, and were similarly
related to growth rate as stated in the GRH. The strong
links among P:N stoichiometry, RNA:protein ratio, ribosomal requirement for protein synthesis, and growth rate
of unicellular organisms indicated by the study have ecological implications. The relationships among the parameters may be used to characterize growth rate and the
overall efficiency of protein synthesis of the organism by
measuring RNA:protein ratio. In a wider context, it may
provide a means of elucidating the N and P economies of
complex ecological systems. An example is the N and P
economy of soil organic matter. P:N ratios of surface soil
organic matter reported in several studies [42-45] are in
the same range as the P:N ratio calculated from RNA and
protein contents in the studied microorganisms. The

other example is the average P:N ratio in oceanic waters,
which is close to the P:N ratio in marine phytoplankton
[1]. This ratio is equal to the canonical Redfield ratio and
also lies in the range indicated by the study. It is plausible,
therefore, that the cellular RNA:protein stoichiometry,
which characterizes the conservative protein synthesis
machinery of the cell, has an impact on the average P:N
ratios in different environments.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/30

in order to estimate their effect on RRNA:Pr and RP:N. The
total P and N contents were not measured in the studies.
We calculated these values from the mean weight percentage of these elements in RNA and proteins [5], namely
15% nitrogen and 8% phosphorous in RNA, and 17.2%
nitrogen in proteins.

Conclusion
Results of the study show that the environment of microorganisms affects their growth rate through trade-off
between growth and cellular maintenance. The change in
the allocation of the cellular resources in response to
growth conditions may affect not only the number of synthesized ribosomes in the cell as postulated by the GRH,
but also the overall efficiency of protein synthesis in the
cell and, therefore, the RNA:protein and P:N ratios of the
microorganisms. This regularity may underlie the similarity in the P:N ratios of diverse organisms. The P:N stoichiometry of organisms, in turn, appears to have a decisive
influence on the chemical composition of the natural
environment.

Methods
Experimental data used in the study were obtained from
the papers referenced in the Table 1. In all studies except
S. ruminantium, the organisms were cultured in different
growth media supporting their steady state growth at a
variety of growth rates. In the case of S. ruminantium, a
strictly anaerobic ruminal bacterium, the organism was
grown in a steady-state continuous culture, under energy
(glucose) limitation (as often occurs in the rumen) to control growth rate. No N or P limitation was reported in the
studies. The number of growth conditions, temperature,
and growth rates of the organisms are given in Table 1.
The total weights of proteins were determined in alkaline
and hot-acid extracts of cells. The total number of RNA
and DNA molecules was estimated in the perchloric acid
soluble fraction. In studies of E. coli, S. coelicolor, M. bovis,
S. cerevisiae (two studies) and N. crassa, the relative
amount of ribosomal RNA in total RNA was estimated by
spectroscopic methods or by separating rRNA on a linear
sucrose gradient. The number of active ribosomes in these
experiments was estimated as polyribosomes. The distribution of ribosomes in polyribosomes and ribosomal
subunits in the studies was determined using zonal
sucrose gradient centrifugation. PER were calculated from
experimentally determined rRNA contents and the fraction of active ribosomes by equations 1 and 2. The mass
of total RNA and proteins per cell were used to calculate
(i) the ratio between these parameters by mass (RRNA:Pr),
(ii) total P and N contents in RNA and proteins per cell,
and (iii) the ratio between P and N contents (RP:N). The
