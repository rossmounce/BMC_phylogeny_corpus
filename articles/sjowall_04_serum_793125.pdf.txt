Abstract
This study was performed to investigate the relation between
IgG autoantibodies against human C-reactive protein (antiCRP) and disease activity measures in serial serum samples
from 10 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), of
whom four had active kidney involvement during the study
period. The presence of anti-CRP was analysed by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay. The cut-off for positive anti-CRP
test was set at the 95th centile of 100 healthy blood donor
sera. Specificity of the anti-CRP antibody binding was
evaluated by preincubating patient sera with either native or
monomeric CRP. Disease activity was determined by the SLE
disease activity index (SLEDAI), serum levels of CRP, anti-DNA
antibodies, complement components and blood cell counts. Of
50 serum samples, 20 (40%) contained antibodies reactive
with monomeric CRP, and 7 of 10 patients were positive on at

least one occasion during the study. All patients with active
lupus nephritis were positive for anti-CRP at flare. Frequent
correlations between anti-CRP levels and disease activity
measures were observed in anti-CRP-positive individuals.
Accumulated anti-CRP data from all patients were positively
correlated with SLEDAI scores and anti-DNA antibody levels,
whereas significant inverse relationships were noted for
complement factors C1q, C3 and C4, and for lymphocyte
counts. This study confirms the high prevalence of anti-CRP
autoantibodies in SLE and that the antibody levels are
correlated with clinical and laboratory disease activity
measures. This indicates that anti-CRP antibodies might have
biological functions of pathogenetic interest in SLE. Further
prospective clinical studies and experimental studies on effects
mediated by anti-CRP antibodies are warranted.

Keywords: autoantibodies, C-reactive protein, disease activity, SLEDAI, systemic lupus erythematosus

Introduction
Although it is well known that hereditary as well as environmental factors are of aetiological importance in systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE), and despite a large body of
information, the disease remains an enigma and continues
to frustrate scientists, clinicians and patients [1]. Deviant
cytokine patterns and hormonal factors and abnormal T cell
and B cell function with a wide range of autoantibodies and
immune complexes (ICs) have all been implicated in the

aetiopathogenesis of SLE [2]. Recently, the roles of pentraxins, dysregulated apoptosis and deficient clearance of
apoptotic material in SLE have attracted much attention
[3–10]. The current view is that inefficiently removed
autoantigens from dying cells are immunogenic and result
in the occurrence of autoreactive lymphocytes and autoantibodies [11–14]. Apart from antinuclear antibodies, antibodies against cytoplasmic and extracellular antigens,
including plasma proteins, are commonplace [15].

Pentraxins are phylogenetically conserved pentameric
acute-phase proteins that are expressed during infection,
systemic inflammation or tissue damage [4]. The family
includes long pentraxins, such as pentraxin 3 produced by
mononuclear cells in response to lipopolysaccharide,
interleukin-1β and tumour necrosis factor-α, and liverderived short pentraxins, namely C-reactive protein (CRP)
and serum amyloid P component generated by stimulation
with interleukin-6 [4,16].

bodies have any biological relevance, but considering the
opsonic and complement-regulating properties of CRP,
there are several pathogenetic implications. The present
study was undertaken to analyse circulating levels of antiCRP autoantibodies (anti-CRP) in serial serum samples
from SLE patients in relation to biochemical and clinical
disease activity markers.

Materials and methods
Patient sera

The pentraxins share several properties, including the
ability to activate the complement system and to bind to
apoptotic cells [4,17]. Phosphocholine and antigens, for
instance chromatin, histones and small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), that are targeted during systemic
autoimmunity are recognised by CRP and serum amyloid
P component [4,18]. Furthermore, CRP binds ICs [19]
and facilitates the clearance of soluble or particulate
‘debris’ by means of phagocyte Fcγ receptors (FcγRs)
[3,20–22]. Some of these effects can be ascribed to
monomeric CRP (mCRP), which is assumed to be the
tissue-based form of the acute-phase reactant [23]. Native
pentameric CRP is irreversibly dissociated into monomers
when the pH is raised or lowered or in conditions with
high urea and/or low calcium concentrations [24].

R88

Circulating autoantibodies against mCRP are commonly
found in SLE [25,26]. It is not known whether these anti-

Sera from 10 patients with SLE who were taking part in a
prospective control programme at the Department of
Rheumatology, Lund University Hospital, Sweden, were
studied. Serial serum samples were drawn on five different
occasions and the sera were kept frozen (at −70°C) until
analysed. Clinical characteristics are summarised in
Table 1. The median number of ACR criteria was seven
(range four to nine) and the mean age when entering the
study was 38 years (range 10–69 years). Nine of the 10
patients were women. Four of the 10 patients (identified
as BÅ, HG, AM and CM) had active kidney involvement
with proteinuria (more than 0.5 g of albumin per 24 hours),
haematuria and/or cellular casts by urine analyses at some
time during the study.
On the occasion of each blood sampling, disease activity
was assessed by the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI)
[27]. The index was also modified (mSLEDAI) by the

Available online http://arthritis-research.com/content/6/2/R87

exclusion of laboratory items (complement and antibodies
against double-stranded [ds] DNA). All patients showed
signs of disease activity defined as a SLEDAI peak score
of at least 7 (median 16) for a median time of 16.1 months
(range 5–27 months). The term ‘flare’ was used to
describe the time-point of highest mSLEDAI score. Treatment with prednisolone, antimalarials, azathioprine,
cyclosporine A and cyclophosphamide was recorded. No
other corticosteroid-sparing agents were prescribed.
In seven patients, one or two samples were obtained
before the time-point of flare. The remaining three patients
were admitted with recent-onset disease and high disease
activity, and in these cases no ‘pre-flare’ samples were
available. In all patients, at least two samples were
obtained after flare.
One hundred sera from healthy blood donors (50 women,
50 men; mean age 36 years) served as controls.
Routine laboratory measures

Laboratory tests included serum measurements of CRP,
complement components (C1q, C3 and C4), anti-dsDNA
antibodies, blood cell counts and urinary analyses. AntidsDNA IgG antibodies were measured with three different
methods: Farr assay (DPC/Skafte Mölndal, Sweden), a
commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA;
Euroimmun, Lübeck, Germany) and an ‘in-house’ ELISA
based on plasmid DNA [28]. CRP was measured by turbidimetry, and C1q, C3 and C4 were determined by electroimmunoassay.

human IgG, specific for γ-chains (Dako, Glostrup,
Denmark) diluted 1:500 in PBS–Tween, was added to
each well and plates were incubated for 60 min. The substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma), diluted to 5.7 mM
in deionised water, was added to each well and the plates
were incubated in a dark room for 60 min at 20°C. Optical
densities (ODs) were measured at 405 nm and results
were expressed as a percentage of a positive reference
sample from an SLE patient at flare (‘SLE reference’) or as
the OD. The cut-off value for positive result was calculated
from the 95th centile obtained in the control material. The
SLE reference was always included. All results refer to the
net OD after subtraction of the background OD obtained
on uncoated plates. To avoid systematic errors, the
samples from SLE patients and those from controls on the
microtitre plates were always randomly mixed and
analysed at the same occasion.
Inhibition assays

Eleven patient sera with strong reactivity regarding antinucleosome antibodies as judged by our assay were used
for blocking experiments. The sera were preincubated
overnight with increasing concentrations of a mixture of
dsDNA (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and total
histones (Sigma) in the same proportions as that used for
microtitre plate coating in our anti-nucleosome antibody
ELISA [14]. Patient sera diluted 1:100 in PBS–Tween
were compared with sera preincubated overnight with
DNA–histones in PBS–Tween. The samples were then
analysed by a commercial anti-nucleosome antibody kit
(Anti-Nucleo; GA, Dahlewitz, Germany), using isolated
nucleosomes as the source of antigen.

Anti-nucleosome and anti-CRP assays

IgG-class antibodies against nucleosomes were measured as described by Mohan and colleagues [14]. Successful coating of ELISA plates with a DNA–histone
complex was confirmed by strong positive reactions with a
monoclonal mouse anti-nucleosome antibody (B6.Sle-1),
which was a gift from Dr Chandra Mohan (University of
Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, USA).
IgG antibodies against CRP were determined essentially
as described previously [25]. In brief, 96-well microtitre
plates (Immulon 2; Dynatech Labs, Chantilly, VA, USA)
were coated overnight at room temperature with native
human CRP (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) in
carbonate–bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6) at a concentration
of 1.0 µg/ml. Such binding of CRP to polystyrene surfaces
has been shown to cause conformational changes exposing non-native regions of the pentameric CRP molecule,
namely mCRP, unless the plates are precoated with phosphocholine bound to keyhole limpet haemocyanin [29].
Patient sera, diluted to a standard concentration of
0.3 mg/ml IgG in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing Tween, were added in triplicates and incubated for
60 min. An alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-

Human CRP (Sigma) was modified by treatment with 8 M
urea and 10 mM EDTA as described by Kresl and colleagues [24]. The preparation was then dialysed with
Slide-A-Lyzer (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA) versus Tris–HCl
buffer (pH 8.0), and finally centrifuged at 800 g for 10 min.
The capacity of urea/EDTA-modified CRP and native CRP
to block antibody binding to solid-phase CRP in sera was
measured by adding increasing amounts of native or
mCRP to 11 anti-CRP positive sera. Sera were diluted
1:100 and analysed in quadruplicate but were otherwise
treated as described above.
Quality of CRP

According to the manufacturer, human plasma was the
source of CRP, which had been isolated by gel chromatography and had a purity of at least 99% as measured by
SDS-PAGE. We also checked the CRP preparation by
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique for potential
DNA contamination [30]. No DNA was detected. However,
the CRP preparation was found to decrease the PCR
detection limit for DNA to 0.2%, meaning that at most
0.2 ng of DNA could have been present in the antigencoated microtitre plates (0.1 µg of antigen preparation/well).

Results of the anti-C-reactive protein autoantibody (anti-CRP)
analyses. Twenty of 50 systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) sera were
positive; 7 of 10 patients were positive on at least one occasion.
Positive samples are indicated by filled circles, negative samples by
open circles. The positive control (SLE reference) sample was defined
as 100%. All samples below 0% were considered negative.

Statistics

Correlations were calculated with Spearman’s rank correlation, and differences between groups were calculated
with the Mann–Whitney U test.
Ethics

Informed consent was obtained from each patient and the
study protocol was approved by the local ethics committee.

Results
As seen in Fig. 1, IgG reactive with human CRP was
detected in 20 of 50 serum samples (40%). Seven of 10
patients were positive on at least one occasion, whereas
three patients were consistently anti-CRP negative. Six of
10 patients were anti-CRP positive at flare (Fig. 2). In
three patients (HG, AM and DD), elevated levels of antiCRP preceded the flares (Fig. 3), whereas pre-flare
samples were not available for three patients (BÅ, CM and
MS). No significant differences in anti-CRP reactivity were
found between women and men in the controls (P = 0.7).
Three of five control sera that fell outside the 95th centile
originated from male blood donors.

All patients with active kidney involvement were anti-CRP
positive at flare, whereas four of six patients without
ongoing kidney involvement were anti-CRP negative at
flare (Fig. 2). None of the three consistently anti-CRP-negative patients (IS, AR and BB) showed signs of nephritis
during the study period (Table 1). Generally, AR and BB

had a milder form of disease with no history of nephritis,
fewer ACR criteria, low anti-DNA levels and SLEDAI
scores, but did not otherwise differ from other patients in
medication, CRP levels or antibody profiles (not shown).
In two of the anti-CRP-positive sera, signs of weak nonspecific IgG binding to the plastic surface of the microtitre
plates were found. However, the ODs achieved on
uncoated wells were much below the values obtained on
CRP-coated plates, and all results refer to differences
between ODs obtained on coated and uncoated plates.
Table 2 illustrates the associations between anti-CRP
levels (OD) and the different clinical and laboratory
disease activity measures on both individual and collective
bases. With accumulated data, positive correlations were
found for SLEDAI, mSLEDAI and anti-dsDNA antibody
levels, and significant inverse relations were noted for
complement factors C1q, C3 and C4, and with lymphocyte counts. Each anti-CRP-positive individual showed
correlation with at least one variable, and patients with
nephritis tended to have more and stronger correlations.
The capacity of native CRP and mCRP, respectively, to
block antibody binding to microtitre plate-bound CRP
were studied in 10 anti-CRP-positive SLE sera plus the
SLE reference sample and is shown in Fig. 4a. Soluble
native CRP showed no capacity to inhibit anti-CRP
binding, whereas mCRP caused a dose-dependent
decrease in antibody binding.

The levels of anti-CRP did not correlate with the levels of
anti-nucleosome antibodies (r = 0.0136), indicating that
anti-CRP does not reflect antibodies against nucleosomes
(not shown). Furthermore, preincubation of anti-nucleosome antibody-positive patient sera with DNA–histone
solution resulted in a dose-dependent reduction of reactivity in the commercial anti-nucleosome antibody ELISA
(Fig. 4b).

Discussion
The SLEDAI is helpful in assessing disease activity [27],
and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics
(SLICC) scores are of use in estimating disease severity
and damage due to medical side-effects [31]. Although
analysis of complement factor C1q and antibodies against
dsDNA can be helpful [15,32], there is a need for reliable
biochemical markers of disease activity in SLE. Acutephase reactants, such as CRP and serum amyloid A, are
far better markers of disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis
than in SLE [15].

Relations between anti-C-reactive protein autoantibody (anti-CRP) levels
and systemic lupus erythematosus disease activity index
(SLEDAI)/modified SLEDAI (mSLEDAI) scores in the 10 SLE patients.
Anti-CRP results are given as optical density (OD). In three cases (HG,
AM and DD), high levels of anti-CRP preceded the peak mSLEDAI score.

When we recently confirmed Bell’s finding of autoantibodies against mCRP in SLE sera [26], we noticed that some
patients were anti-CRP positive on one occasion and negative on another [25]. This raised the question of whether
anti-CRP levels might vary over time and be associated
with disease activity or flares, and/or certain disease manifestations.

vious study we did not find an association with anti-DNA
antibody levels [25]. The reason for this can be sought both
in methodological differences for anti-DNA antibody detection and in the different selection of patient sera.
Patients with SLE often show elevated serum levels of
nucleosomes [14,33], and because CRP binds to several
nuclear structures [21], including nucleosomal antigens, it
could be argued that anti-CRP in reality might reflect interactions between circulating nucleosomes and anti-nucleosome antibodies. However, our data strongly argue
against this possibility. Correlation analysis showed no
association between anti-CRP and anti-nucleosome antibody reactivity. Furthermore, no DNA was detected in the
CRP preparation. This, together with the fact that all three
consistently anti-CRP-negative patients (IS, AR and BB)
were anti-DNA antibody positive in 12 of 15 serum
samples, makes the chance that anti-CRP actually reflects
anti-DNA antibodies negligible.

Results of the inhibition assays. (a) Statistically significant differences
(P < 0.001) were seen in all three concentrations between C-reactive
protein (CRP) and monomeric CRP (mCRP) considering the ability to
inhibit anti-CRP binding, indicating that anti-CRP autoantibodies are
targeted to the monomeric form of the acute-phase protein.
(b) Increasing concentrations of soluble DNA–histones showed a
dose-dependent decrease in anti-nucleosome antibody reactivity.
Statistically significant differences (P < 0.001) between each
concentration of DNA–histones were seen. OD, optical density.

Although the material in this study is limited to 50 samples
from 10 patients, many interesting observations were
made. Generally, the serum levels of anti-CRP paralleled
the clinical disease activity, usually with high levels at the
time-point of flare. Both individually and collectively, significant correlations were found between anti-CRP levels and
several clinical and laboratory disease activity measures,
namely serum levels of anti-DNA antibodies, complement
factors C1q, C3 and C4, and SLEDAI scores, regardless of
whether complement components and anti-DNA antibodies
were included (Table 2). Strong correlations were found,
especially in individuals with kidney involvement. In our pre-

In conformity with earlier studies [25,26], the detected
anti-CRP antibodies do not bind native pentameric CRP
and are not correlated with circulating levels of CRP.
Others have shown that the limited CRP response seen in
SLE, despite active disease, is due to deficient production
rather than increased consumption [34]. Kidney involvement often results in more pronounced discrepancies
between CRP and disease activity [28]. However, the very
low CRP levels seen in SLE patients with glomerulonephritis, often contrasting with levels of other acutephase reactants, might in fact be due to the consumption
of CRP by ICs [35]. With this in mind we find the high frequency (4 of 4) of anti-CRP in patients with ongoing
kidney involvement interesting, given the pathogenetic
implications of ICs in lupus nephritis, but extended studies
on larger materials are needed. Prospective studies are
also needed to evaluate whether changes in anti-CRP
levels can predict disease flares.
It is open to speculation whether the presence of antiCRP autoantibodies is merely an epiphenomenon or
whether it actually reflects events of pathogenetic interest.
The binding of CRP to cellular FcγRs is believed to
account for its opsonising properties; pentameric CRP
binds primarily to the low-affinity FcγRIIa (CD32) and to
some extent to the high-affinity FcγRI (CD64), whereas
mCRP binds to the low-affinity FcγRIIIb (CD16)
[3,20,36,37]. It is conceivable that mCRP exposed on cellular surfaces might be a target for anti-CRP. In this connection, and in view of earlier findings of mCRP
expression on human peripheral blood lymphocytes
[38,39] and accelerated apoptosis of lymphocytes from
SLE patients [7], we find the inverse relation between high
anti-CRP levels and lymphopenia interesting. Hypothetically, this correlation might result from an opsonisation of
lymphocytes expressing mCRP on their cell surface,

leading to increased elimination through the reticuloendothelial system.
Defective clearance of apoptotic debris, including nuclear
constituents, is most likely to be important for the persistence of autoantigens in SLE [2,12–14,22,33,40]. High
levels of apoptotic peripheral blood mononuclear cells
have been shown in SLE patients [41], whereas correlation with disease activity scores has been reported only
for apoptotic neutrophils [42]. The functions of CRP
include binding to, and clearing from the circulation, chromatin, nucleosomes and snRNPs [4,21,22]; that is,
nuclear antigens to which antinuclear antibodies are commonly targeted [15]. Binding of autoantibodies to their
target antigens results in the formation of ICs in situ
and/or in the circulation. Under normal conditions, circulating ICs are eliminated through the liver after complementmediated binding to erythrocytes [43,44]. Deficient
complement-mediated IC handling increases the risk of
extra-hepatic IC deposition and subsequent complementmediated inflammation of the affected tissues [45].
CRP facilitates the clearance of ICs and apoptotic debris
by FcγR-mediated uptake in phagocytes [20,36], and
when the tissue microenvironment becomes acidic owing
to inflammation, CRP is dissociated to mCRP, which
further enhances the binding of ICs to FcγRs [19]. In addition, by binding C1q, CRP has complement-activating
properties, which also promote IC clearance [3,4,11].
Speculatively, anti-CRP autoantibodies could interfere
with the physiological mCRP-mediated removal of IC and/
or nuclear constituents [4,19,36,40]. Further prospective
clinical and experimental studies aimed at investigating
biological effects of anti-mCRP are merited to elucidate
these questions further.

Conclusion

16.

In this study of well-characterised patients we confirm the
high prevalence of autoantibodies against monomeric
CRP in SLE and show that the antibody levels are correlated with most disease activity measures. This indicates
that anti-mCRP might have functions of pathogenetic
interest in SLE.
