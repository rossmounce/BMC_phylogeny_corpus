A poxvirus Bcl-2-like gene family involved in
regulation of host immune response: sequence
similarity and evolutionary history
José M González, Mariano Esteban*

Abstract
Background: Poxviruses evade the immune system of the host through the action of viral encoded inhibitors that
block various signalling pathways. The exact number of viral inhibitors is not yet known. Several members of the
vaccinia virus A46 and N1 families, with a Bcl-2-like structure, are involved in the regulation of the host innate
immune response where they act non-redundantly at different levels of the Toll-like receptor signalling pathway.
N1 also maintains an anti-apoptotic effect by acting similarly to cellular Bcl-2 proteins. Whether there are related
families that could have similar functions is the main subject of this investigation.
Results: We describe the sequence similarity existing among poxvirus A46, N1, N2 and C1 protein families, which
share a common domain of approximately 110-140 amino acids at their C-termini that spans the entire N1
sequence. Secondary structure and fold recognition predictions suggest that this domain presents an all-alphahelical fold compatible with the Bcl-2-like structures of vaccinia virus proteins N1, A52, B15 and K7. We propose
that these protein families should be merged into a single one. We describe the phylogenetic distribution of this
family and reconstruct its evolutionary history, which indicates an extensive gene gain in ancestral viruses and a
further stabilization of its gene content.
Conclusions: Based on the sequence/structure similarity, we propose that other members with unknown function,
like vaccinia virus N2, C1, C6 and C16/B22, might have a similar role in the suppression of host immune response
as A46, A52, B15 and K7, by antagonizing at different levels with the TLR signalling pathways.

Background
Innate immune cells recognize pathogens through pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) [1]. PRRs include
Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors and
NOD-like receptors. Pathogen recognition activates an
immune response through signalling pathways that trigger the expression of genes encoding Type I IFNs and
pro-inflammatory cytokines. Poxvirus genomes contain
a large number of genes involved in avoiding the host
immune response to viral infection [2,3]. Known examples are vaccinia virus (VACV) genes coding for proteins
A46, A52, B15, K7 and N1, which interfere with TLR
signalling pathway at different levels. A46 contains a
putative Toll/Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain and
targets several TIR adaptors like MyD88, MAL (TIRAP),

TRIF and TRAM [4,5], thus blocking MAP kinase activation and TRIF-mediated IRF3 activation. A52 targets
IRAK2 and TRAF6, and has a greater effect than A46
on inhibiting the activation of NF-kappaB [4,6]. Strikingly, it has been reported that A52 also activates p38
MAPK and potentiates LPS-induced IL-10 [7]. Sequence
relationship between A52 and N1 proteins led to experiments that related N1 with the inhibition of NF-kappaB
activation by several signalling pathways [8]. N1 is an
intracellular homodimer that has been shown to associate with several components of the IKK complex and
with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) thus inhibiting
NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation, respectively [8,9],
although recent experiments could not reproduce these
interactions [10,11]. The crystallographic structure of
N1 reveals a surprising similarity to Bcl-2 family of
apoptotic regulators despite the absence of sequence
homology [11,12]. Moreover N1 binds with high affinity

to BH3 peptides from pro-apoptotic proteins Bid, Bim
and Bak [12] and even inhibits the increase in mitochondrial membrane permeability and caspase 3/7 activation after apoptotic stimuli [11]. B15 (named B14 in
VACV strain Western Reserve) is an intracellular virulence factor [13], and has been found to target the IKK
complex by avoiding IKKbeta phosphorylation and subsequent IKK activation which would lead to degradation
of IkappaB, the inhibitor of NF-kappaB [10]. The crystallographic structures of A52 and B15 have been
recently solved, showing that both are homodimers with
a Bcl-2-like fold similar to that of N1 [14]. But in contrast to N1 the BH3-peptide-binding groove in both
structures is occluded, what may explain why they cannot protect staurosporine-treated cells from apoptosis
[14]. Similarly to A52, K7 inhibits TLR-induced NF-kappaB activation and interacts with IRAK2 and TRAF6
[15]. Besides, K7 has been shown to modulate innate
immune signalling pathways by binding the cellular
DEAD-box RNA helicase DDX3, which forms part of a
complex with TBK1-IKKepsilon that activates IRF3, thus
inhibiting the IRF3-mediated IFNbeta gene transcription.
This interaction was not observed in the case of A52. A
NMR solution structure of K7 reveals a monomer that
adopts a Bcl-2 fold, although similarly to A52 and B15
its pro-apoptotic peptide binding groove is predicted
not to be functional [16]. The molecular details of the
K7-DDX3 interaction have recently been unveiled [17].
In the Pfam database of protein families and domains
[18] A46, A52, B15 and K7 are included in a single family
(Pox_A46) together with other poxvirus proteins like
VACV C6 and C16/B22, whereas N1 is classified in the
Orthopox_N1 family. Because of the importance of host
immune response modulation for poxviruses we hypothesized the existence of additional genes involved in this role
among those of still unknown function. Hence, in this
investigation we have searched for homologues of
Pox_A46 family within poxvirus genomes using bioinformatics tools. We have found a clear relationship of A46
family not only with N1 but also with poxvirus N2 and C1
protein families, suggesting that these proteins probably
adopt a common structural fold. The sequence relationship existing among these four families is presented. These
similarities indicate that VACV C6, C16/B22, N2 and C1,
whose function is currently unknown, may be involved in
suppressing the host immune response through the inhibition of either apoptosis or the TLR signalling pathway. In
addition we show that this family is present exclusively in
a monophyletic subset of vertebrate poxviruses. The
reconstruction of the evolutionary history of this gene
family indicates numerous gene gain events in more
remote ancestral genomes and a further stabilization of
the gene contents in extant genomes.

Results and Discussion
Poxvirus A46, N1, N2 and C1 protein families share a
common domain

In order to find remote homologues of the proteins
belonging to Pox_A46 family, we used sensitive Hidden
Markov Models (HMM) profile-based searches through
HHpred, a sequence homology search method based on
HMM profile vs. profile comparisons [19]. A Pox_A46
family multiple sequence alignment from Pfam database
was used as input to run HHpred against a database of
all Pfam HMM profiles. The results confirmed the relationship between the Pox_A46 and Orthopox_N1
families (97.6% probability, e-value 3.4E-06), but also
revealed the homology existing between the A46 family
and two other families of poxvirus proteins: Pox_N2L
(98.8% probability, e-value 1.6E-10) and Orthopox_C1
(72.5% probability, e-value 0.026). A similar search,
started with the multiple sequence alignment of
Pox_N2L family extracted from Pfam database, detected
the Pox_A46 (99.9% probability, e-value 2.5E-25),
Orthopox_C1 (97% probability, e-value 2.8E-06) and
Orthopox_N1 families (74.5% probability, e-value 0.4).
To detect every protein sequence related to these
families, an iterative HMM search was started with the
Pox_A46 HMM profile from Pfam database against a
poxvirus protein sequence database. This search
detected with significant e-values not only sequences
containing the Pox_A46 domain, but also proteins
belonging to other three Pfam families: Orthopox_N1,
Pox_N2L and Orthopox_C1 (Additional File 1). Thus
the sequence relationships among the four families were
confirmed and all sequences belonging to any of them
were collected. A multiple sequence alignment (Figure
1A) revealed that despite their size heterogeneity all
these proteins contain a common conserved region of
110-140 residues at their C-terminal ends, leaving Nterminal ends of diverse lengths outside this region. For
instance, in N1 (VACV-WR_028) the conserved region
spans its whole length, while A46 (VACV-WR_172) has
almost 90 extra N-terminal amino acids. A single HMM
profile was built from the common conserved region of
all these sequences and was used to refine the search. A
HMMer search with this profile vs. UniProt database
[20] found all and only the previously collected
sequences. All the significant hits detected were poxvirus proteins. This result confirms the validity of the
relationship among the four families (A46, N1, N2 and
C1) and suggests that these four families should be
merged into a single one.
Within this set of related poxvirus families threedimensional structures are known for VACV proteins
N1, A52, B15 and K7. They present a similar compact
structure, formed by 6-7 alpha-helices, with outstanding

similarity to the Bcl-2 family fold despite their lack of
sequence homology with these cellular proteins. Homology at the sequence level with A46 and N1 families
implies that members of the N2 and C1 families will
probably adopt the same Bcl-2-like fold. Interestingly,
the predicted secondary structure of the conserved
region in N2 and C1 proteins is compatible with this
fold (Figure 1A). To test the hypothesis that these proteins share the common domain of A46 and N1
families, multiple sequence alignments of N2 and C1
families were used to start HHpred searches against a
sequence profile database derived from proteins with
structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [21]. A
strong relationship was found between N2 and A52
structure (99.0% probability, e-value 1.3E-12). These
results were supported by predicting the structure of
this family with 3D-Jury [22], a fold recognition metaserver that obtains consensus predictions from different
threading servers. In all cases the best hits were structures belonging to A46 and N1 families. Only in the
case of C1 the results were not conclusive either with
HHpred (42.5% probability, e-value 0.35) or with 3DJury (not shown). However, given that C1 sequence
homology to N2 is evident from the HHpred searches,
both families will probably share the Bcl-2-like common
domain.
Conserved residues in the common domain of the
poxvirus protein families

Highly conserved amino acids of a multiple sequence
alignment usually indicate that these residues are important for protein structure and/or function. In addition,
amino acids that are conserved only in certain subfamilies are indicative of importance for specific functions
carried out by these proteins subfamilies. A multiple
sequence alignment of the common domain containing
representative sequences of the four families (A46, N1,
N2 and C1) was analyzed to get an insight of the conserved residues. The Proteinkeys web server [23] was
used to find both conserved residues in all families and
specific residues for individual families. Although the
minimum sequence identity between the most divergent
sequences of the four families can be as low as 15%, at
least three conserved motifs could be distinguished in
the multiple sequence alignment (Figure 1A): [LIVM]-xx-Y- [IFL]-x- [WY]- [RS] in alpha-helix 1, G-x-x- [FY]x-x- [LF]-x-x- [FYL]- [KD]-x-x-A in alpha-helix 2, and
[IV]-G- [LF]-x- [ASG] in alpha-helix 5 (alpha-helices
numbered according to N1). Since a common fold is
assumed for all families, the sequence information was
placed in the context of one of the known three-dimensional structures, that of N1 (PDB:2I39) (Figure 1B).
Interestingly, alpha-helices 1, 2 and 5 are packed in
close contact to one another in the common fold

structure. Most of these conserved residues are hydrophobic and buried inside the protein core, so they are
expected to have an essential role to preserve the
domain structure stability. Because of their level of conservation and their position in the structure they might
have been related to the pro-apoptotic peptide binding
site.
Alpha-helix 1 forms part of the dimerization surface
in N1, B15 and A52 proteins [11,12,14]. In the N1
homodimer residues Arg7 and Asp14 of alpha-helix 1 of
different monomers form a potential salt bridge, contributing to dimer stability. This interaction is not found
in A52 and B15 dimers as the relative orientation of
monomers varies. Alpha-helix 2 is an amphipathic helix
whose charged side is exposed and in the case of N1
contains several residues involved in BH3-peptide binding like Leu30, Glu32 and Leu33. The C-terminus half
of alpha-helix 5 contains mostly hydrophobic residues
and is buried in the protein core. One pair of amino
acids identified by Proteinkeys as being conserved specifically in one subset of proteins is that of charged residues Arg12 and Asp31, which are located in conserved
motifs in alpha-helices 1 and 2, respectively. These positions are highly correlated in the multiple sequence
alignment, where both are present in a large subset of
members of N1 and A46 families and completely absent
in others. These amino acids join alpha-helices 1 and 2
through a potential salt bridge and probably contribute
to the stability of BH3-peptide binding site structure.
The same interaction is also conserved in K7 (Arg37
and Asp61) and A52 (Arg67 and Asp87) proteins. On
the other hand there are a number of charged residues
which are exposed on the surface of the proteins with
known structure and seem relatively conserved in all
families. For instance the pattern of charged residues
alternating with hydrophobic residues in alpha-helix 2 is
observed in N1, K7, B15 and A52 structures and it can
be predicted in other proteins from their sequences. In
N1 protein residues projecting outwards from alphahelix 2 include Asp22, Lys25, Lys26 and Glu32, of
which only the last one belongs to the ligand binding
site [11]. Arg81 at the C-terminal end of alpha-helix 5
in N1 is exposed and charged residues at equivalent
positions are conserved in A46 and N2 families. Conservation of these exposed residues may indicate a possible
functionality, for instance an interaction with other proteins. Experimental data revealing detailed poxvirus-host
protein interaction mechanisms are still scarce and
more will be needed to confirm whether any of the conserved residues is functionally important.

the whole family first we built its complete phyletic

genes in the ten orthologue groups. For simplicity only a representative species of every poxvirus genus, as depicted in (B), was selected.

pattern, meaning by that the distribution of the subfamilies or groups of orthologues that integrate the gene
family across all species of chordopoxviruses. Our gene
set was divided into ten orthologue groups (Figure 2A).
These orthologue groups are exclusively present in a
monophyletic group that includes the genus Orthopoxvirus and a clade comprising five other genera (Yata-,
Capri-, Sui-, Lepori- and Cervidpoxvirus), named Clade
II by convention [24]. We could not find any remote

homologue of this gene family in the remaining taxonomic groups of the poxvirus phylogeny. The distribution and number of genes of every orthologue group
varies among different species (Figure 2B and Additional
File 2), although they are always restricted to both terminal genome regions, where genes involved in virus-host
interaction are usually located in poxvirus genomes
[25,26]. Eight of the orthologue groups can be found in
orthopoxvirus genomes: N1L, N2L, A52R and B15R can

González and Esteban Virology Journal 2010, 7:59

also be found in the Clade II species, whereas C6L, C1L,
K7R and A46R are unique to orthopoxviruses. On the
other hand two subfamilies are absent in this genus:
those of orthologous genes to myxoma virus m136R and
deerpoxvirus 159R, respectively.
The information provided by the phyletic pattern was
superimposed on a consensus phylogenetic tree built
from several single-copy conserved genes in all poxviruses. The topology of this tree was similar to other
poxvirus phylogenies [27,28]. The family gene content
evolution across the poxvirus phylogeny was reconstructed using the maximum likelihood method of Miklos and Csuros [29] implemented in the program Count
[30]. This method allows inferring the genome sizes and
gene repertoires of ancestral viruses, along with gene
gain and loss events. The reconstruction of the evolutionary history of the family (Figure 3) suggests that the
common ancestor of orthopoxviruses and the Clade II
would have contained three genes of this family. Which
orthologue group it could have belonged to cannot be
deduced since probabilities are low for all of them (p <
0.5). As a comparison, reconstruction by parsimony suggests that this ancestor would have had four subfamilies
(N1L, N2L, A52R and B15R). Less controversy exists
between both methods for more recent ancestors. The
common ancestor to all orthopoxviruses would have
contained eight genes, what implies five gene gain
events according to the maximum likelihood method. In
this occasion the gene content of the ancestral virus is
more evident as it most likely contained all eight orthologue groups present in practically every extant orthopoxvirus (with p = 1). In the branch leading to the
Clade II its common ancestor would have possessed
four genes belonging to this family, implying three gene
gains over the preceding node. The four genes present
in the ancestral genome were with p = 1 N2L, A52R,
m136R and B15R. More recent evolutionary events
include small gene gains and small gene losses in the
branches leading to extant species. Altogether these data
suggest that this gene family originated in the virus lineage leading to the common ancestor of orthopoxviruses
and the Clade II, where between three and four gene
gain events occurred. However it is unlikely that these
gene gains occurred independently in a single ancestral
virus. Furthermore, because of the evident sequence
similarity among the putative genes in the ancestral
virus genome, the most probable hypothesis would be
that a Bcl-2 protein had been acquired from a eukaryotic host by the common ancestor of the subset of vertebrate poxviruses previously mentioned and probable
events of gene duplication occurred within its genome
before speciation proceeded. After the divergence of
both poxviruses lineages new gene gain events increased
the number of orthologue groups, probably because of

Page 6 of 12

the evolutionary advantage that these proteins conferred
over the host organism in terms of regulation or suppression of antiviral immune response. However in
more recent ancestors the overall number of subfamilies
within poxvirus genomes appears to have stabilized. An
explanation for this stabilization might be that the gene
repertoire of this family was varied enough to accomplish its mission.
N1 is the only protein of this family with the same
functionality as the putative Bcl-2 ancestor gene so far.
While keeping the same basic tertiary structure these
proteins evolved until they managed to bind a diverse
range of cellular proteins involved in an important pathway in response to pathogen attacks. As yet the presence
of only other three families of Bcl-2-like genes has been
confirmed in poxviruses. They are vaccinia virus F1L [31]
with orthologues in all orthopoxviruses, myxoma virus
M11L [32,33] with orthologues in all genera of the Clade
II, and fowlpox virus FPV039 [34] with orthologues in
avipoxviruses. These are apparently single-copy genes
and have no sequence similarity with the A46 and related
Bcl-2-like families. Furthermore they lack sequence
homology among them and only the avipoxvirus protein
displays some sequence similarity with cellular Bcl-2 proteins. Very interestingly, these three families carry out
the same function, apoptosis inhibition by binding proapoptotic BH3 peptides, but do not coincide in any poxvirus genome. Whether the origin of every poxvirus Bcl2-like protein is independent or they arose from a gene
present in a common ancestor of chordopoxviruses and
any sequence relationship was lost during successive speciation events is undetermined. Nevertheless it is tempting to consider that the presence of other Bcl-2-like
apoptosis inhibitors in poxvirus genomes offered the A46
and related families the opportunity to freely evolve.
Functional considerations of the four protein families

The common structural core and the sequence homology to N1 might suggest that some of the other proteins
belonging to A46, N2 and C1 families could be involved
in an anti-apoptotic role as N1. However this functionality has yet to be proven. On the contrary, it has been
discarded for A52 and B15 [14] and probably for K7
[16]. However, the proteins A46, A52, B15, K7 and N1
target diverse host participants of the TLR signalling
pathway (Figure 4) that are apparently unrelated among
them, suggesting that the mechanisms of action of these
poxvirus proteins are heterogeneous. We describe below
the information available thus far on A46, N1, N2 and
C1 families regarding the functional characteristics of
these proteins, which might help to infer the molecular
mechanism of these functionalities and find whether
these functions can be transferred to other proteins in
these families.

Figure 4 Inhibition of host signalling pathways by VACV members of A46 and related families. TLRs are distributed in the plasma
membrane and endosomes. When a pathogen is recognized by a TLR adaptor proteins are recruited which transmit the signal further
downstream until specific transcription factors are activated and enhance the expression of genes encoding type I IFNs and pro-inflammatory
cytokines. VACV proteins belonging to A46 and N1 families interfere with the TLR signalling pathway at different levels. A46 targets all known
adaptor proteins: MyD88, MAL (TIRAP), TRIF and TRAM. A52 targets IRAK2 and TRAF6, intermediary between adaptors and transcription factors. K7
inhibits IRAK2, TRAF6 and also DDX3, which is part of the complex that activates transcription factor IRF3. B15 targets the IKK complex by
avoiding IKKbeta phosphorylation, what eventually causes the inhibition of NF-kappaB. N1 associates with several components of the IKK
complex and with TBK1, inhibiting NF-kappaB and IRF3 activation, respectively.

N1 is the only of these families with an experimentally
confirmed anti-apoptotic role. The N1 binding site to
BH3 peptides consists basically of a hydrophobic groove
flanked by charged residues [11]. Functional N1 residues
are scarcely conserved in the rest of related families
(Figure 1A). However, among the set of N1 residues
which putatively interact with BH3 peptides, there are
three residues (Ile75, Leu30 and Glu32) which belong to
conserved motifs in alpha-helices 2 and 5. Proteins A52
and B15 do not inhibit staurosporine-induced apoptosis
and this might be explained because in their surfaces
the BH3-peptide binding groove would be blocked due
to the greater length of alpha-helix 2, about one turn
longer in comparison with that of N1 protein [14].

Alpha-helix 2 in N1 has 12 residues while in A52, B15
and K7 it comprises 17 residues. In most members of
the families A46, N2 and C1, the length of alpha-helix 2
can be predicted because two conserved Gly residues
usually delimit it, and in all cases it would have approximately the same length as in A52. Thus none of these
proteins would be expected to have anti-apoptotic properties like N1, although experiments should be performed to confirm this hypothesis.
VACV A46 inhibits TLR signalling pathway by binding to MyD88 and TRIF adaptors, a TIR-like domain
being likely responsible for these interactions. This TIRlike domain has not yet been found in other VACV proteins or other poxvirus proteins apart from close A46

homologues in orthopoxviruses. Three conserved
sequence motifs of TIR domains were described along
the A46 protein sequence [4,5]: one in its unique N-terminus and the other two in the alpha-helices 1 and 7 of
the common domain with N1. Despite the sequence
similarity in these motifs the overall predicted structure
of A46 protein is not coincident with that of TIR
domains, which in the case of TLR1 and TLR2 contain
a central five-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by
five alpha-helices on both sides [35]. In fact we could
not find any relationship of A46 or any other VACV
protein with TIR domains by using tools for remote
sequence homology search or fold recognition (data not
shown). This seems to discard the straightforward explanation that A46 would have acquired its unique role by
grabbing a functional TIR domain from a host cell genome. In fact, if A46 had really evolved from a remote
Bcl-2-like ancestor and not from a TLR-like ancestor
the origin of the TIR conserved motifs might have probably been due to mutations which constituted an evolutionary advantage for viruses containing this gene.
A52 inhibits TLR-dependent NF-kappaB activation by
binding to both TRAF6 and IRAK2 [4,6]. Experiments
with different mutant proteins have produced some data
about A52 interaction with these host proteins at the
molecular level. A deletion mutant including its N-terminal 144 residues was sufficient for inhibiting NF-kappaB
activation and was able to interact with IRAK2 but not
with TRAF6 [6], although it is not clear whether TRAF6
interacts with the A52 C-terminus. Moreover the Nterminal 36 residues of A52 were not required to inhibit
IL-1alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation [14]. A small
peptide from VACV A52 has been shown to mimic the
function of the whole protein as it avoids TLR-dependent cytokine secretion [36]. Recent experiments
demonstrating that A52 inhibits NF-kappaB activation
by several TLRs only through its interaction with IRAK2 but not TRAF6 [37] support the hypothesis that this
peptide acts on IRAK-2. The sequence corresponding to
the peptide is moderately conserved among A52 orthologues and poorly conserved among other related poxvirus proteins. On the other hand we could not find in
A52 sequence a canonical TRAF6-binding motif, P-x-Ex-x-(acidic/aromatic), that was identified in several
TRAF6 cellular interaction partners [38]. This suggests
that A52 must bind TRAF6 through a different
mechanism.
The crystal structure of K7 in complex with a 20
amino-acid DDX3 peptide has determined the precise
details of their interaction [17]. DDX3 binds to a deep
hydrophobic pocket in a negatively charged face of K7
delimited by its N-terminus, alpha-helix 1 and a nonhelical segment equivalent to alpha-helix 6 in Bcl-2-like
proteins. Interestingly, this region corresponds to the

Page 9 of 12

dimerization interface in A52, which differentiates from
K7 in that it cannot bind DDX3. Like A52, K7 binds the
TRAF domain of TRAF6 [15] but our search did not
find a canonical TRAF6-binding motif in its sequence.
It is striking how proteins of these families evolved
from a common Bcl-2-like domain with anti-apoptotic
role to perform diverse functions always related with the
inhibition of the host immune response, more specifically the TLR signalling pathway, but at different levels
and using different mechanisms. These poxvirus proteins probably act at the level of subtle protein interaction to sequester a target protein or impede a complex
formation, but their mechanisms of action are mostly
unknown. Although the structures of some of these proteins have been elucidated, as yet only one of them
represents a complex with a host target peptide, what
still hinders the prediction of possible functions for
other members of these families.
Experimental data are scarce or even absent for VACV
proteins C1, C6, N2 and C16/B22. C6 protein has been
found in a very low proportion in vaccinia virus IMV
particles [39], as is the case of A46. One possible reason
for their presence in the virion could be that they are
necessary for the viral cycle early after virus entry. On
the other hand a VACV attenuated strain with a C6L
gene deletion has shown an enhanced immune response
in vivo (manuscript in preparation), indicating that this
protein may also be involved in the regulation of the
host immune response. An early study revealed N2 location in the host cell nucleus during virus replication and
discovered that a single nucleotide substitution in the
5’-UTR of N2L gene was responsible for an alpha-amanitin-resistant phenotype [40]. This data could suggest a
possible function of N2 in transcription, although this
hypothesis has not been confirmed yet. An experiment
performed to determine interactions between VACV
and host cell proteins revealed three possible interacting
partners for C6 and other three for N2, as determined
by yeast two-hybrid and validated by pull-down [41].
However none of them seems to be directly related with
the host immune response. One of the C6 binding partners was programmed cell death 6 interacting protein
(PDCD6IP/ALIX), which has been involved in apoptosis
regulation, cytokinesis and HIV-1 budding. VACV C6
also interacted with keratin 4 (KRT4) and troponin I,
skeletal, fast (TNNI2). In the same experiment three
possible binding partners were described for N2: karyopherin alpha 2 (KPNA2), that may be involved in
nuclear transport of proteins, phospholipid scramblase 4
(PLSCR4), that participates in the regulation of the
movements of phospholipids in membranes, and valosin
containing protein p97/p47 complex interacting protein
1 (VCPIP1), a deubiquitinating enzyme required for
Golgi and ER assembly. These interaction data can help

González and Esteban Virology Journal 2010, 7:59
http://www.virologyj.com/content/7/1/59

to uncover possible roles of C6 and N2, although they
must be taken cautiously until more specific experiments are performed. To our knowledge, no experimental data have been published yet about VACV proteins
C1 or C16/B22.
Recent studies on vaccinia virus transcription revealed
the existence of an immediate-early class of genes [42].
This class includes five genes of this family (A52R,
B15R, C6L, K7R and N2L), while other five (A46R, N1L,
C1L and C16L/B22R) belong to the early class. An
immediate-early or early expression pattern can be characteristic of proteins involved in immune response evasion. Thus, those data agree with the known functions
of A46, A52, B15, K7 and N1, and may support a possible role in immune response evasion of the members of
these families with still unknown function.
The above findings have implications in the use of
poxviruses as vaccines, in particular vaccinia virus attenuated strains MVA [43,44] and NYVAC [45] that have
been studied extensively [46]. In comparison with strain
WR, MVA lacks A52R and C1L genes while NYVAC
lacks C6L, N1L, N2L and C1L genes. However MVA
contains one (MVA189R) and NYVAC contains two
(C16L/B22R) additional genes with similarity to B15R
which are not present in strain WR. A major difference
in behaviour between these attenuated strains is that
NYVAC provokes greater cytopathic effect, phosphorylation of EIF2-alpha and apoptosis in infected cells [47].
C6L, N2L and N1L are among the genes present in
MVA and absent in NYVAC and thus could explain this
behaviour.

Conclusions
We have described the sequence relationship among
four families of poxvirus proteins, A46, N1, N2 and C1,
which share a common domain with a Bcl-2-like fold,
and proposed their integration into a single family. The
phylogenetic distribution and reconstruction of the evolutionary history of this family indicate that it originated
in the common ancestor of orthopoxviruses and a clade
formed by five other poxvirus genera. After initial
increases in the family gene content in the most ancestral viruses a balance between gene gains and losses
appears to have stabilized the number of family members in extant poxviruses. Their roles determined so far
indicate that these proteins have specialized in regulating the host immune response, clearly suggesting that
similar functions should be researched for other members of this family with still undefined function, like N2,
C1, C6 and C16/B22. The diversity of host targets and
the lack of precise data about what residues are involved
in poxvirus-host protein interactions hamper the prediction of new targets for these families. Nevertheless,
based on secondary structure predictions, our analysis

Page 10 of 12

foresees that practically all members of this family will
be unable to bind pro-apoptotic peptides and inhibit
apoptosis as N1 does. This study highlights the relevance of poxvirus protein families in innate immune
sensing and suggests, from a point of view of the application of attenuated poxviruses as vaccines, that to
avoid redundancy in related functions, gene deletions of
entire families should be considered when recombinant
vectors are developed with improved immune capacity.

Methods
Sequence homology analysis

Poxvirus protein sequences were obtained from the Poxvirus Bioinformatics Resource Center database [48,49].
Multiple sequence alignments of families were
retrieved from Pfam database version 23 [18] when indicated. A global sequence alignment was obtained with
MAFFT [50] using the L-INS-i mode with default parameters and including three-dimensional structures to
guide the alignment. The alignment was then manually
adjusted.
Profile versus profile searches were performed with
HHpred [19] in the global alignment mode and scoring
secondary structure. Searches were carried out against
Pfam-A_23 and PDB70 HMM profile databases available
in the same web server.
Iterative searches with HMMer [51], a method based
on HMM profile vs. sequence comparisons, were performed as follows. A single search was started with a
HMM profile against a database of poxvirus protein
sequences. All hit sequences below a threshold e-value
of 0.01 were automatically aligned and from the alignment a new HMM profile was built which was used to
start a new search. This was performed several rounds
until the search reached the convergence, i.e. no new
sequences were added.
Secondary structure predictions were performed with
PsiPred [52] starting from multiple sequence alignments
of single families.
Phylogenetic analyses

The Bayesian phylogenetic tree of representative proteins of orthologue groups was obtained by running
MrBayes v3.1.12 [53,54] for 100000 generations in two
rounds of two chains each through the Phylemon web
server [55]. Trees were visualized with Phylodendron
[56].
For the poxvirus phylogenetic tree concatenated alignments of proteins encoded by five single-copy conserved
poxvirus genes (E9L, J3R, J6R, H6R and D5R) from
every chordopoxvirus species with at least one fully
sequenced genome were used. An entomopoxvirus species was used as an outgroup to root the tree. The maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was built with

PhyML v3.0 [57] with the LG substitution model, four

invariable sites and branch support estimated by nonparametric bootstrap analysis with 100 replicates.

Reconstruction of the family gene content evolution

Competing interests
The authors declare that they have no competing interests.

Groups of orthologous proteins were detected by using
the bidirectional best hit method. Starting with a dataset
containing all poxvirus sequences, a BlastP [58] search
was performed with every sequence within or with
homology to the A46 family against the whole dataset.
Two proteins belonging to different species were considered orthologues if each was the best hit of the other in
their respective species. The orthologue groups obtained
were contrasted with the Poxvirus Orthologous Clusters
[59] from the Poxvirus Bioinformatics Resource Center
database. For simplicity, several paralogues were
included in orthologue groups in the cases of orthopoxvirus proteins in the B15R group and Clade II proteins
in the N2L group.
The gene content evolution was reconstructed with
Count [30]. Input data comprised a table with the distribution of the groups of orthologous genes across the
chordopoxvirus genomes (Additional File 2) and the
poxvirus phylogenetic tree (Additional File 3). The
ancestral reconstruction by likelihood maximization
based on a phylogenetic birth-and-death model was chosen [29]. Rate optimization was performed using a gainloss-duplication model with a Poisson family size distribution at the root. Family sizes and lineage-specific
events (gains, losses, expansions and contractions) were
computed using posterior probabilities in the optimized
gain-loss-duplication model.

from concatenated alignments of sequences of proteins encoded by five
single-copy conserved poxvirus genes (E9L, J3R, J6R, H6R and D5R) from
every chordopoxvirus species with at least one fully sequenced genome.
Protein sequences from an entomopoxvirus (AMEV-Moyer) were included
to root the tree.
