Abstract
Background: Helicobacter pylori is presumed to be co-evolved with its human host and is a highly
diverse gastric pathogen at genetic levels. Ancient origins of H. pylori in the New World are still
debatable. It is not clear how different waves of human migrations in South America contributed
to the evolution of strain diversity of H. pylori. The objective of our 'phylogeographic' study was to
gain fresh insights into these issues through mapping genetic origins of H. pylori of native Peruvians
(of Amerindian ancestry) and their genomic comparison with isolates from Spain, and Japan.
Results: For this purpose, we attempted to dissect genetic identity of strains by fluorescent
amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP) analysis, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of
the 7 housekeeping genes (atpA, efp, ureI, ppa, mutY, trpC, yphC) and the sequence analyses of the
babB adhesin and oipA genes. The whole cag pathogenicity-island (cagPAI) from these strains was
analyzed using PCR and the geographic type of cagA phosphorylation motif EPIYA was determined
by gene sequencing. We observed that while European genotype (hp-Europe) predominates in
native Peruvian strains, approximately 20% of these strains represent a sub-population with an
Amerindian ancestry (hsp-Amerind). All of these strains however, irrespective of their ancestral
affiliation harbored a complete, 'western' type cagPAI and the motifs surrounding it. This indicates
a possible acquisition of cagPAI by the hsp-Amerind strains from the European strains, during
decades of co-colonization.
Conclusion: Our observations suggest presence of ancestral H. pylori (hsp-Amerind) in Peruvian
Amerindians which possibly managed to survive and compete against the Spanish strains that
arrived to the New World about 500 years ago. We suggest that this might have happened after
native Peruvian H. pylori strains acquired cagPAI sequences, either by new acquisition in cagnegative strains or by recombination in cag positive Amerindian strains.

Background
Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that established itself in the human stomach possibly thousands of
years ago [1]. This opportunistic pathogen infects over
50% of the worlds' population, causing no harm to most
colonized people [2]. Only a small subset of infected people experience H. pylori-associated illnesses such as
chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric carcinoma,
and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Associations of various clinical outcomes with
disease-specific virulence factors remain dogmatic [3]
years after the completion of genome sequences [4]. The
debate has been further intensified as some studies have
posed the possibility that H. pylori infection has some protective effects in esophageal diseases [3]. Also, possible
symbiotic associations have been proposed based on the
finding that H. pylori harbor protective, bacteriocin like
effect and may therefore be beneficial to its host [5].
Subsequent to the decipherment of the potential of polymorphic DNA markers in reconstruction of human migration and phylogeography [6,7], pathogen genotypes were
successfully used in tracking and analyzing patterns of
human migrations [8-10] in different continents.
Recently, sequence variation in H. pylori has provided a
window into human population migration [11] and also
revealed that impact of religions on stratification of
human ethnic groups can be analyzed based on H. pylori
haplotypes [12].
Ancient origins and dissemination of H. pylori are quite
debatable in the context of the vast South American continent that has witnessed many different waves of population migration [13], especially in view of the fact that H.
pylori has been present in this continent since pre-Columbian times [14]. However, evolution of virulence and fitness in such 'ancient' strains that arrived first in the
Americas and then, possibly out-competed by the influx
of 'modern' strains from Europe [14] remains largely
unexplored.
A landmark study based on PCR based DNA motif analysis proposed that H. pylori jumped recently from animals
to humans and, therefore, the acquisition of H. pylori by
humans may be a recent phenomenon [15]. This study
has been the basis for the idea of 'H. pylori free New World'
[15]. However, two independent studies based on largescale analyses of candidate gene polymorphisms contrasted the idea of recent acquisition and suggest that H.
pylori might have co-evolved with humans [11,16]. In
view of these intriguing ideas on ancient origin of H.
pylori, additional evidences based on strains from different
geographical regions (especially those with a rich history
of multiple waves of human migrations such as the South
Americas) are clearly needed.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/191

We attempted to dissect gene pool diversity of Amerindian isolates of H. pylori from Peru with an objective to
explore ancient and modern features of the Peruvian H.
pylori strains corresponding to different waves of human
migration. We also looked if it is possible to link some of
the native Peruvian strains to their ancestors in Asia.

Results
FAFLP based genotyping, candidate gene sequence
analysis and multi-locus sequencing
Phylogenetic relationships assessed by FAFLP genotyping
of Peruvian isolates (Figure 1A) revealed 2 different lineages corresponding to the hp-Europe and hsp-Amerind.
Representative isolates from both the lineages obtained
by FAFLP were subjected to reconfirmation by MLST analysis. We observed that all the isolates corresponding to the
Amerind type FAFLP profile were found to be genetically
closer to strains from Alaska and were therefore, accepted
as genotype hsp-Amerind. All the other isolates from Peru
clustered with those from Spain and therefore joined
MLST genotype hp-Europe.

We looked at the geographic signatures of oipA gene
sequences in Peruvian isolates and found that 7 of the 27
isolates including the 2 hsp-Amerind isolates had an Eastern type oipA (CT < 6) signature; 4 of these had a non functional gene (frame out) (Table 1). Nineteen of the
Peruvian isolates had a western type oipA (CT ≥ 6), 15 of
which had a functionally intact coding frame. It appears
that oipA sequence conveys the European ancestry for a
majority of these isolates, including some hsp-Amerind,
however, oipA is a virulence linked gene and its resolution
power for lineage identification is not as robust as that of
the 7 housekeeping genes we used, or the babB gene. It is
likely that oipA might have been exchanged or recombined between different lineages (like most of the other
virulence genes such as the cagPAI) to give hybrid genotypes.
The babB gene sequences of our hsp-Amerind isolates were
compared to the sequences previously reported for Amerindian isolates from Venezuela by Ghose et al. [16] by
multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis
(Figure 1B). These phylogenies, when studied in the light
of MLST based inferences, revealed distinct affinities
between Peruvian Amerindian strains and Venezuelan
Amerind strains, pointing thus to their common Asian
origins (Figure 1B).
In summary, our overall phylogenetic analyses, demonstrated that about 20% of the strains from native Peruvian
patients that we examined share common genotypic patterns with Asian (Amerind) strains and therefore, Ancient
Asian gene pool must have been the origin of the present
day strains inhabiting the native Peruvians.

A. FAFLP analysis of H. pylori strains analyzed from native Peruvians (n = 27). The phylogenetic tree was developed based on
various amplitypes generated for individual isolates after allele scoring and generation of similarity profiles in the form of binary
tables. Genetic relationships in the form of a tree were deduced using MEGA 3.0 software using bootstrapping method at
10000 bootstrap trials. Two different lineages observed in the tree are colored as per the previous conventions [11, 20]. Six
isolates from among those represented in the FAFLP tree (highlighted with circles) were also analyzed subsequently by MLST.
B. Phylogenetic analysis of representative hsp-Amerind sequences from our isolates (SJM 83, 92) and those of other Amerind
and non-Amerind (western) H. pylori sequences previously described by Ghose et al. from Caracas and Puerto Ayacucho in
Venezuela [16]. SJM 83 and 92 formed a separate branch (maroon color) only with Amerind isolates (right). Both the Amerindian and western lineages (green color) are differentially colored as per previous conventions [11, 20]. Sequence alignment
(left) of these Amerind sequences revealed significant conservation at the level of nucleotides.

Table 1: Characteristics of 26 Peruvian H. pylori isolates obtained from Amerindians and distribution, presence/absence and or rearrangement of various gene loci in their
genomes; 0 – region not amplified, 1 – region present.

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:191

Analysis of the cagPAI and the cagA gene in isolates from
Spain, Peru and Japan
Overlapping primer amplification strategy to span entire
cagPAI worked very well with our hsp-Amerind isolates
(Figure 3A) where all the constituent genes of the PAI were
successfully amplified. This indicates that the 5 Amerind
strains we looked at represent a 'chimera genome' made
up of an ancient like core genome component (MLST and
babB typing) and a modern type flexible genome component (cagPAI and its right junction typing). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunodominant cagA protein is
known to occur at the EPIYA motifs at the C-terminus by
the SRC family of kinases [17,18]. This EPIYA motif consists of 4 distinct EPIYA sites – EPIYA-A, -B, -C and -D,
based on the amino acid sequence that neighbor it (Figure
3B). Based on the presence of these EPIYA motifs, cagA
can be distinguished into the Western type (W) in case the
-C site is present and the East Asian (EA) type in case
where the -C site is replaced by the -D site. Our data for the
type of EPIYA motifs present in Spanish (n = 6), Peruvian
(n = 27), and Japanese (n = 16) strains revealed that the
western type of cagA was predominant among all the
Spanish and Peruvian strains. The Japanese isolates alone
revealed East Asian type EPIYA D signatures (Figure 3B).

Results of the PCR of cagPAI from 26 Peruvian isolates
studied in the present context have been depicted in Table
1. Briefly, the strains from Peru and Spain did not readily
amplify regions of the cagPAI as did Japanese isolates, suggesting thereby a distinct allelic diversity at the primer
binding sites in the western PAI of these isolates. This
observation places native Peruvian strains closer to Spanish strains and therefore hints that both the Spanish and
Peruvian strains harbor a similar type of cagPAI.
The right junction of the cagPAI also revealed similar
acquaintances based on PCR based insertion deletion and
substitution analysis of the region spanning cagA right
junction to glr, for the 6 Peruvian isolates we analyzed.
Such genotypes for all the isolates we used from Spain,
Japan and Peru were determined earlier by Kersulyte et al
[15]. Collectively, this study and the previous observations [15] demonstrated that the cag right junction motif
types were shared by Spanish and Peruvian isolates and
that Japanese isolates did not share genetic affinities with
Peruvian strains. This observation again places native
Peruvian strains closer to Spanish strains and therefore
hints that both the Spanish and Peruvian strains share cagPAI insertion sites and the regions flanking them.

Discussion
H. pylori is presumed to be an ancient colonizer of the
human stomach which possibly co-evolved with its host.
We report that at least some of the H. pylori strains found
in Peru share considerable homology with strains found

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/191

in Asia. This supports the hypothesis that H. pylori was
associated with its host well before Asian people crossed
the Bering strait (20,000 years BP) to colonize America.
We also report that the cagPAI was acquired by native
Peruvian strains probably from a European source. This
might have occurred as a single import, most probably
during the last 500 years of the spread of H. pylori in the
South American continent. It is evident from the fact that
the Amerindian Peruvian strains, though of an Asian
descent, do not share characteristic features of Asian cagPAIs but show homology to the PAIs of European strains.
Alternatively, the Amerindian strains might have gained
the PAI through a series of recombination events over a
period of time. But this hypothesis appears weak when we
take into account the short time span of 500 years within
which the European strains spread in the Americas.
We tried to potentate these ideas and to provide evidence
in favor of the ancient origin of the pathogen and the possibility that some extraneous gene cassettes might have
been acquired by otherwise symbiotic H. pylori, sometimes during its natural history. To support this proposition, our methodology was targeted with a two pronged
approach to i) further substantiate ancient link of the
pathogen and ii) to prove that the pathogenicity island
was a 'recent' addition to the genome of H. pylori. Our
analyses based on FAFLP and MLST linked about 20% of
the Peruvian isolates to Amerindian genotype, and conveyed that H. pylori was most probably introduced to the
New World by Asian people. We, therefore, disagree with
the idea of an 'H. pylori free New World' [15]. This disagreement of interpretation arose possibly because Kersulyte et al. [15] looked at only a few loci in the genome and
stressed mainly on the motifs surrounding the cagPAI on
its right junction.
We also looked at the cagPAI of such strains and found
that the Peruvian isolates we tested carried western type
(EPIYA C) cag islands (Figure 3B). We did not record any
eastern type signature in the cagPAI (EPIYA D motif) in
Peruvian isolates, given a distinct presence of ethnic Japanese in Peru. This inference also came from MLST data
(Figure 2), where none of the Peruvian isolates clustered
with Japanese genotype hp-EastAsia (Figure 2). Similarly,
the absence of Asian/Amerindian type islands (or their
remnants in native Peruvian isolates we analyzed, leads us
to speculate that their ancestors in Asia were seemingly
benign due to (natural?) absence of functional cag genes.
This finding potentates the idea that cag genes in Peru
mainly originated in Europe and therefore confirms the
scenario proposed by Kersulyte et al. [15] as far as the cagPAI and its right junction is concerned.
Kauser et al., [19] from our group have previously
described PCR analyses of the cagPAI for more than 300

MLST analysis based on concatenated gene sequences of 7 housekeeping genes of H. pylori (Kimura-2 parameter)
MLST analysis based on concatenated gene sequences of 7 housekeeping genes of H. pylori (Kimura-2 parameter). The phylogenetic tree was based on a total of 19 sequence records (concatenated) obtained under this study (SJM, HUPB, HU, CPY) while
incorporating other ~400 sequence records from pubMLST database (pubmlst.org) which were specific to different genotypes
in the world (Courtesy, Daniel Falush). Different genetic populations (Hp) and subpopulations (hsp) or genotypes are named
and differentially colored after previous conventions [11, 20]. All SJM isolates, Amerindians (SJM23 and 92-highlighted) and
non-Amerindians (arrowheads) analyzed by us from Peru are highlighted in bold face black fonts with green twigs indicating
presence of a western type cagPAI.

Figure 3 PCR based analysis of whole cagPAI of hsp-Amerind isolates from Peru
A. (Top)
A. (Top) PCR based analysis of whole cagPAI of hsp-Amerind isolates from Peru. Overlapping primers spanning all of the constituent genes (see methods) amplified all the corresponding PCR products in the expected size range as described previously
[30]. M indicates molecular weight marker (100 bp ladder). (Bottom) Amino acid signature of cagA (phosphorylation motifs –
colored) – characteristic of modern cagA EPIYA (EPIYA C) as observed for all the SJM isolates from Peru. B. Pictorial depiction (right) of different types of cagA-EPIYA motif types prevalent in different H. pylori populations and their distribution in our

strains from different parts of the world. Of these, the
majority of strains from whom complete PAI was amplified were from Japan (57%) whereas only 18.6% strains
from Peru and 13.3% strains from Spain could support
amplification of an intact cagPAI, due mainly to allelic
diversity present at the primer annealing sites. These
observations were further endorsed by our present analysis that revealed that all the Peruvian isolates we analyzed
carried only the European type PAI.
It has been recently reported that true Amerind strains
either do not carry a cagPAI or carry only a vestigial,
incomplete PAI [20]. It is already well known that H. pylori
can import short stretches of DNA from strains from very
different populations when they (presumably co-) infect
individuals in the same location. However, it appears that
the cagPAI and the region surrounding it had been
exchanged by the Amerindian strains in Peru, where, the
human population underwent major changes in recent
history with the arrival of European conquerors and settlers. The long isolated Amerindian H. pylori strains thus
came in contact with the European strains, which harbored a cagPAI. It is established that the cagPAI might give
selective advantages during host colonization and therefore, "endogenous" Helicobacter, in Peru could be outcompeted in a human community with newly arrived cagPAI positive strains introduced by the European conquerors. The "endogenous" Helicobacter strains could
moreover acquire cagPAI during mixed infection with
western cagPAI positive strains leading to the observed
strains with Eastern-like core genome content and a western-type cagPAI. So this finding would really be interesting if it is clear that the entire cag-island had been
exchanged. Then, there would be a very interesting question about the mechanism by which an entire island had
been transferred; there is no doubt that such exchanges
have happened at some point, but if they happened
within the last 500 years, then, there would be much better chances of catching it in action. This is probably where
the present data lead us to, and, we suggest that future
efforts may be directed towards confirmation of this evolutionary mechanism.
Finally, it is possible that phylogenetic methods based on
highly recombining gene loci [21-27] may not be fully
perfect to predict genetic relationships in terms of inheritance from different ancestral populations, especially
when we use tools such as Mega 3.0 [28] which do not
support admixture analysis. Partly in view of this possibility and to ensure that our conclusions did not represent
shortcomings of a single approach, we adopted an integrated genotyping strategy for the cagPAI [29,30] as well as
the core genome through MLST of less recombining, neutral genes that encode cytoplasmic enzymes. Given the
fact that these housekeeping genes are selectively neutral

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/191

and uniform as compared to virulence associated loci
such as the flagellins and vacA [31], recombinant and
hybrid alleles that blur phylogeographic inferences, could
be a rare occurrence rather than a rule. Nonetheless, it will
be important to ascertain proportions of nearly pure and
hybrid alleles among native Peruvian H. pylori through
admixture analyses based on sophisticated population
genetics tools [32] that reveal contemporary gene flow
and proportion of different nucleotides inherited from
ancestral populations on an evolutionary time-scale.

Conclusion
In summary, our study based on profiling of several gene
loci and neutral markers revealed certain distinctive
genetic features of the H. pylori gene pool in Peru. Important among these features are a demonstrated genetic link
with Asian (Amerindian) strains and the presence of an
intact cagPAI with western type of gene motifs that point
to recent acquisition of this important pathogenicity
island. This indicates possible lateral gene transfers during
colonization of Peruvian Amerindians with both 'ancient'
and 'modern' strains for several generations. Such an
admixed gene pool could be an important source of
genetic information on pathogen evolution in real time to
possibly understand how gene acquisition and loss on a
population wide scale shape virulence and fitness in different pathogens.
This could also possibly provide for a reasonable model of
geographic evolution to understand acquisition of virulence in pathogenic bacteria over a period of time.

Methods
Bacterial strains, genomic DNA and diagnostic PCR
Genomic DNA preparations for strains originating from
Peru, Spain and Japan were provided by D. E. Berg and
Asish Mukhopadhyay (Washington University, St. Louis,
Mo.). These DNA were isolated from patients diagnosed
with gastric ulcers from Spain (HupB); gastric cancer and
DU cases from Japan (CPY, Hu); and from gastritis cases
alone from Peru (SJM). However, in the current study, the
clinical background of the individual isolates was not
taken into account. The Peruvian isolates we looked at (n
= 27) were originally from Native Peruvian people mainly
of Amerindian ancestry from Lima [15]. PCR based analysis of genes namely glmM, babB [16] and oipA was carried
out to ascertain the quality of DNA samples we used. Also
these PCR assays served as amplification level controls for
the analysis of insertion, deletion and substitution in the
cagPAI.
Integrated genotyping of H. pylori based on chromosomal
DNA signatures
Whole genome fingerprinting based on FAFLP genotyping
was performed as described previously [21-23]. Briefly,

Page 8 of 10

BMC Genomics 2006, 7:191

the profiling of whole genome micro-restriction fingerprints with EcoRI/MseI enzymes using fluorescence tagged
primer pairs EcoRI+A/MseI+0 and EcoRI+G or A/MseI+0
was performed for all the strains. The PCR amplified fragments for each of the strains were then subjected to electrophoretic separation on a 5% acrylamide gel and scoring
of the fluorescent markers was done using an automated
DNA analysis workstation (ABI Prism 3100 DNA
sequencer). Cluster analysis of DNA profiles was conducted on the basis of fingerprint characteristics. All the
data obtained through molecular genotyping and DNA
profiling were deposited in the genoBASE pylori database
[33]. The genoBASE pylori server was queried for comparative analyses.
Genotyping based on candidate genes oipA and babB was
carried out as described [24-26]. Short stretches of oipA
gene were analyzed to determine the 'geographic signature' based on CT repeat [27]. In addition, 600 bp region
each from the 7 housekeeping genes spread throughout
the genome [atpA, efp, ureI, ppa and mutY, trpC, yphC] was
amplified and sequenced for all the isolates exactly as
described previously [11]. Sequencing was performed
with both forward and reverse primers, using an ABI
Prism 3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, USA).
PCR and direct sequencing were performed at least twice
to determine and confirm the DNA sequences for each
isolate. Consensus sequence for each of the samples was
generated using Genedoc (version 2.6.002). Multiple
alignments of sequenced nucleotides were carried out
using Clustal X (version 1.81). Neighbor joining trees
were constructed in Mega 3.0 [28], using bootstrapping at
10000 bootstrap trials (FAFLP and babB) and through
Kimura-2 parameters (for MLST). For construction of phylogenetic trees based on MLST genotyping procedures,
sequences of 7 housekeeping genes of strains belonging to
different established genotypes were obtained from the
pubMLST database [34] (courtesy, Daniel Falush).
The nucleotide sequences of the 7 housekeeping genes for
the 6 hsp-Amerind isolates we analyzed have been deposited in the GenBank [Accession numbers, GenBank:DQ462362–462367 (atpA), GenBank:DQ462368–
462373 (efp), GenBank:DQ462374–462379 (mutY),
(ppa),
GenGenBank:DQ462380–462385
Bank:DQ462386–462391 (trpC), GenBank:DQ462392–
462397 (ureI), GenBank:DQ462398–462403 (yphC)].
These and other sequences can also be requested from the
authors.
Profiling of the cagPAI
PCR analyses were carried out to find the status of the cagPAI using 8 sets of primers that amplified the cagA gene,
its promoter region, the cagE and cagT genes and the left
end of the cagPAI [25,26,29]. We also analyzed whole cag-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/191

PAI of the representative isolates (SJM92 and SJM23)
from hspAmerind by PCR using overlapping primers as
described by Blomstergren and colleagues [30]. The 3' end
of the cagA gene was amplified using primers mentioned
elsewhere [17] and the amplified products for strains
from Spain, Peru, and Japan were sequenced with forward
and reverse primers. The consensus sequences were then
translated into amino acid sequences using GeneDoc software (version 2.6.002) and were then assigned to the
Western or the East Asian group based on the C or D
repeat present respectively in the EPIYA motif [18]. Chromosomal rearrangements are known to give rise to 5 types
of insertion-deletion and substitution motifs in the region
between the 3' end of cagA gene and the 3' end of the
glutamate racemase (glr) gene. Although the statuses of
these motifs for the Peruvian strains we analyzed were
described previously by Kersulyte and colleagues [15], we
re-assessed 6 of them by PCR exactly as described earlier
[15].
