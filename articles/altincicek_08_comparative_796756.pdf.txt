Abstract
Background: The planarian Schmidtea mediterranea and the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris have emerged
as valuable model organisms in regeneration and stem cell research because of their prominent
ability to regenerate a complete organism from any small body fragment. Under natural conditions
wounding may result from predator attacks. These injuries open their innermost to a wide array
of microbes present in the environment. Therefore, we established the hypothesis that
regeneration processes may be linked to or at least accompanied by innate immune responses. In
order to screen for septic wounding inducible genes we dissected individuals using a scalpel in the
presence of a crude bacterial lipopolysaccharide preparation that is commonly used to elicit innate
immune responses in animals and applied the suppression subtractive hybridization technique that
selectively amplifies cDNAs of differentially expressed genes.
Results: This analysis revealed the induced expression of 27 genes in immune challenged Schmidtea
and 35 genes in immune challenged Hydra. Identified genes from both animals encode proteins that
share sequence similarities with potential homologues from other organisms known to be involved
in signaling (e.g. calreticulin in Schmidtea and major vault protein in Hydra), stress responses (e.g.
Hsp20 in Schmidtea and a PRP19/PSO4 DNA repair protein in Hydra), or to represent potential
antimicrobial effectors (e.g. perforin-like protein in Schmidtea and PR-1-like protein and neutrophil
cytosolic factor 1 in Hydra). As expected, septic wounding also induces expression of genes in
Schmidtea and Hydra potentially involved in tissue remodeling associated with regeneration
processes (e.g. matrix metalloproteinase in Schmidtea and a potential von Willebrand factor in
Hydra).
Conclusion: We identified numerous immune-inducible genes in Hydra and Schmidtea that show
a similar distribution corresponding to their physiological roles, although lineages of both animals
split from their common ancestor for more than five hundred millions of years. The present study
is the first analysis of immune-inducible genes of these two phylogenetically distant model
organisms of regeneration and provide numerous candidate genes that we can use as a starting
point for comparative examination of interrelationships between immunity and homeostasis.

Background
To date, there is no satisfactory answer to the question
why some animals have higher regeneration capacities
than others. The ability to replace lost or injured body
parts is widely distributed among animals, whereas regeneration of a complete organism from any small body fragment is restricted to only few animal phyla and is
accompanied by the ability to reproduce asexually by
budding or fission [1,2]. These features have been attributed to a stable population of stem cells known as neoblasts in Schmidtea mediterranea [3,4] and to both stem cellbased mechanisms and transdifferentiation in Hydra vulgaris [5,6]. These two phylogenetically distant animals
with remarkable regeneration capacities attract renewed
attention as powerful model organisms since both, S.
mediterranea and H. vulgaris, are amenable to systemic
RNAi mediated gene silencing and other genetic tools for
functional gene analyses [7-11].
In their habitats Hydra and Schmidtea may be wounded
by attacks from predators. These natural injuries open
their innermost to a wide array of microbes present in the
environment. Therefore, we established the hypothesis
that regeneration processes may be linked to or at least
accompanied by innate immune responses. As a first step
towards understanding the immune defense reactions of
both model organisms we used the suppression subtrac-

tive hybridization (SSH) technique. This method has been
proven as a valuable tool for identification of novel
immune-inducible genes in a number of animal species,
including representatives of Ecdysozoa [12-18], Lophotrochozoa [19-22], and Deuterostomia [23,24]. Here, we
applied the SSH method to identify genes that are differentially expressed upon wounding in Cnidaria and Platyhelminthes. We selected Hydra and Schmidtea for
analyses because both are currently emerging as genetically tractable models in regeneration, development and
stem cell research. In addition, their complete genome
sequences have recently been determined and will be
available soon [25,26]. The phylogenetic relationship
between Hydra and Schmidtea and model organisms
whose septic-injury inducible genes have previously been
identified using the SSH-method supports comparative
approaches to reconstruct evolution and function of genes
that are linked to immunity (Fig. 1). Further reasons that
make Hydra and Schmidtea amenable to comparative
approach analyses are that both share similar body sizes
and colonize freshwater habitats allowing comparable
experimental conditions.
In this study, we report profiles of injury-inducible genes
from Schmidtea and Hydra, including genes that encode
proteins potentially involved in e.g. immune-inducible
signaling and defense reactions. Comparisons of potential

evolutionary divide occurs in the animal kingdom between the so-called radially symmetric animals, which includes the cnidarian Hydra, and the bilaterally symmetric animals, which includes Schmidtea. The phylogenetic position of these two model
organisms that have been selected for investigations in the present work (indicated by red color) promotes comparative analysis that may help to reconstruct functions and evolution of genes involved in regeneration and immunity. Previously, Branchiostoma belcheri [23], Danio rerio [24], Platynereis dumerilii [19], Biomphalaria glabrata [20,21], Thermobia domestica [12], Tribolium
castaneum [14], Eristalis tenax [13], Manduca sexta [17], and Galleria mellonella [15] have been analyzed by the SSH method.

calreticulin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), and perforin with homologues from other organisms provide

[28]. JNK is a prominent stress kinase that has been studied mostly in the context of cellular stress and apoptotic
cell death following, for example, heat shock, DNA damage, and inflammation [29].

Results and Discussion

Calcium signals in human immune cells participate in the
regulation of cell differentiation and influence lymphocyte motility, immunological synapse formation,
degranulation and phagocytosis [30]. In agreement, we
found several predicted proteins in Schmidtea and Hydra
that show similarities to members of the calcium signaling pathways suggesting that calcium pathways may be
important in immune responses in these animals. One
Schmidtea protein with highest similarities to ferlin family proteins that are known to be associated with both
plasma and nuclear membranes contains a C2 domain
that may play a role in calcium-mediated membrane
fusion events during membrane regeneration and repair
[31]. Additionally, we identified a Schmidtea cDNA that
encodes a potential calcipressin homologue. Vertebrate
calcipressins modulate the pattern of calcineurin-dependent transcription, and may influence calcineurin activity
beyond calcium to integrate a broad array of signals into
the cellular response [32]. The importance of calcineurin
in immunity is highlighted by the use of calcineurin
inhibitors such as cyclosporine as prominent immunosuppressive drugs in humans [33]. Furthermore, we found
a potential Schmidtea phospholipase C that may generate
inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol by hydrolyzing
phosphatidylinositol which in turn leads to raising the
level of intracellular calcium. In Hydra, we determined the
induced expression of a potential diacylglycerol kinase

Subtracted cDNA libraries of immune challenged S.
mediterranea and H. vulgaris
A subtracted cDNA library enriched in immune-inducible
genes from S. mediterranea and H. vulgaris, respectively,
was constructed by using the SSH method. A total of each
288 clones were randomly picked and subjected to colony
PCR. Plasmids of bacterial colonies that have been
screened positively in blot hybridization indicating
induced expression of corresponding genes were isolated
and sequenced. Here, we describe the identification of 27
septic wounding-inducible genes in S. mediterranea
(Table 1) and 35 septic wounding-inducible genes in H.
vulgaris (Table 2) potentially involved in antimicrobial
defense, signaling, and other immunity-linked cellular
processes (Fig. 2).
Signaling
In animals, hereditable receptors including the prominent
Toll-receptors recognize damage- or pathogen-associated
molecular pattern molecules and engage multiple
immune-related signaling pathways [27]. Here, we identified a Schmidtea cDNA encoding a protein that exhibits
highest sequence similarities to p21/Cdc42/Rac1-activated kinase 1 from Apis. In mammals, this kinase is
believed to act directly on the JNK (c-Jun N-terminal
kinase) MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase pathway

Arabidopsis thaliana calreticulin (NP_001031199). This phylogenetic analysis reveal that calreticulins are evolutionarily
conserved and that Schmidtea calreticulin (indicated by gray

that balances between two signaling lipids, diacylglycerol
and phosphatidic acid, by phosphorylating the former
one. Therefore, diacylglycerol kinases may be involved in
numerous lipid and calcium signaling pathways on transient or continuous demands, respectively [34].

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/6

In line with these findings, we identified a Schmidtea calreticulin homologue which is evolutionarily conserved
(Fig. 3). Although originally characterized as a regulator of
calcium homeostasis, more recently it has been shown to
be present on the surface of many mammalian cell types
and has been implicated in signal transduction events
associated with innate immunity, cell adhesion, angiogenesis, and apoptosis [35]. In regard to its immune functions, cell surface levels of calreticulin directly correlate
with the ability of human dentritic cells and polymorphonuclear phagocytes to mediate phagocytosis, and the
capacity of normal and tumor cells to adhere to components of the extracellular matrix [35]. Furthermore, calreticulin has recently been demonstrated to play a crucial
role in the loading of MHC class I molecules with optimal
peptide cargo in mammals [36]. This is a clear example of
ancient mechanisms co-opted by new ones such as the
acquired immunity of vertebrates in the context of the
evolution of the immune system. However, calreticulin is
also a prominent stress-inducible molecular chaperone in
the endoplasmatic reticulum. This is in agreement to our
further identification of stress-related proteins, including
a potential Hsp20/α-crystallin protein and a RAD50 DNA
repair protein from Schmidtea and a PRP19/PSO4 DNA
repair protein and a scythe protein (also known as Bat3)
in Hydra. The latter one is an important regulator of the
apoptogenic mitochondrial intermembrane protein AIF
(Apoptosis-Inducing Factor) in mammals [37] and may
have similar functions in Hydra.
Defense molecules
In this study we describe for the first time a platyhelminth
protein with a relationship to the mammalian perforin,
the macrophage-expressed protein, (Fig. 4) that probably
functions in the Schmidtea innate immune system. Similar proteins have also been identified in porifera and cnidaria [38,39] suggesting that perforins are evolutionarily
conserved defense molecules. That also applies for an
identified Hydra PR-1 (pathogenesis-related proteins-1)
protein that shares sequence similarities with immuneinducible plant PR-1 proteins. The PR-1 family is strongly
conserved in plants, fungi, insects, and vertebrates, including humans, and some recent studies suggest a role as signaling or effector molecule in antifungal defense reactions
in plants [40].

Generation of reactive oxygen species by phagocytes is an
essential mechanism of mammalian host defense against
microbial infections. Several protein kinase C isoforms
have been found to phosphorylate p47phox (neutrophil
cytosolic factor 1), resulting in its membrane translocation and activation of the NADPH oxidase [41]. Here, we
identified a Hydra protein with highest similarities to
p47phox from other animals suggesting that generation
of reactive oxygen species may also be important for anti-

microbial defense in Cnidaria. In addition, we determined several short open reading frames in Schmidtea
and Hydra that may encode potential antimicrobial peptides or signaling molecules. For example, one identified
cDNA encodes a putative antimicrobial peptide that is cationic with potential α-helical structure. It shows significant similarities to antimicrobial esculentin-1B from the
frog Rana esculenta (Fig. 5). This is in agreement with our

observations that H. vulgaris homogenates display inducible antimicrobial activities as determined by the inhibition zone assay against live Micrococcus luteus bacteria
(data not shown).
Interestingly, one immune-inducible transcript from
Hydra exhibits significant sequence similarities to major
vault proteins from other organisms. Very recently, major

vault protein were found to be rapidly recruited to lipid
rafts when human lung epithelial cells are infected with
Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Major vault protein has been
demonstrated to be essential for optimal epithelial cell
internalization and clearance of P. aeruginosa indicating
that it makes a substantial contribution to epithelial cellmediated resistance to infection in mammals [42] and
probably also in Cnidaria. However, the group of Thomas
C.G. Bosch has recently described that in Hydra, similar as
in humans, the immune system maintains a substantial
resident beneficial microbiota on their epithelia [43]. This
suggests that Hydra is able to discriminate 'friend' from
'foe' by killing entities that do damage and let those live
that are commensals or mutualists which is in agreement
to Poly Matzingers' proposed danger model of mammalian immunity [44] and our recent findings from insects
that endogenous alarm signals induce innate immune
responses during infection [45,46].
Cellular homeostasis, cell adhesion related proteins, and
regeneration

potentially involved in cellular homeostasis such as ribosomal proteins, myosin, actin, tubulin and metabolic proteins including Schmidtea isoprenoid biosynthesis

(HMG-CoA reductase) and Hydra glycolytic enzyme enolase. This may reflect the need of an increased cellular
metabolism during tissue regeneration. In addition, we
determined a Hydra dickkopf-like protein that is potentially involved as an antagonist in Wnt signaling [47].
Confirming our result, a recent study demonstrated that
the Hydra dickkopf-like protein expression is stimulated
by the injury signal itself [48]. In vertebrates, wound healing and formation of a specialized wound epidermis
require Wnt/β-catenin signaling and, additionally, the
action of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) [49]. In line
with this, we identified a septic-injury inducible MMP
homologue in Schmidtea that is evolutionarily conserved
(Fig. 6). In Hydra, MMPs were shown to be required in
extracellular matrix degradation and epithelial morphogenesis [50,51]. Members of this evolutionarily conserved
family of enzymes play well-established multifaceted
roles in tissue remodeling due to their capacity to degrade
the extracellular matrix [52] and have recently been recog-

nized as important modulators of immunity both in
mammals [53] and in insects [54].
In addition, we found a Hydra protein with highest similarities to vWF (von Willebrand factor) proteins from
other animals. This vWF protein is crucial for vertebrate
blood clotting by binding to platelet receptors and collagens [55] and, in Hydra, may be important for cell-cell or
cell-basement membrane adhesion processes.
Finally, we performed quantitative real time RT-PCR analyses using RNAs from untreated and immune challenged
Schmidtea to precisely determine expression levels of several selected immune-inducible genes that were identified
in the present study. This analysis confirmed the statictically significant induced expression of HMG-Co-A reductase, calreticulin, Hsp20, MMP, and perforin in response to
septic injury (Fig. 7). The mRNA levels of tubulin and
actin genes were elevated upon wounding but without statistically support due to higher variations of results from
different determinations.

Conclusion
Here, we report a comparative analysis of immune-inducible genes in two phylogenetically distant model organisms of regeneration and stem cell research. We selected
the cnidarian H. vulgaris and the planarian S. mediterranea
for targeted screening of genes that are up-regulated upon
large-scale septic wounding using the SSH method.
Obtained results highlight the ancient origin of some
genes (e.g. MMPs, calreticulin, p47-phox, perforin, and
major vault protein) known from vertebrate immunity.
This is consistent, for instance, with the findings that even
the most ancient animals, porifera, possess functional
Toll-like receptors [56] and with the recent report of a bioinformatic analysis of the immune repertoire in Cnidaria
[39]. However, screening for immunity-related genes in
genomic or EST databases only allows identification of
genes that share sequence similarities with known genes,
while the SSH-approach is particularly suitable for the
experimental screen for yet unknown or unexpected genes
and, therefore, complement the bioinformatic
approaches. Confirming this, the present study increases
the number of genes identified in Schmidtea and Hydra
(e.g. phospholipase C and perforin for S. mediterranea and

An identified Schmidtea MMP gene is related to Hydra MMP and to MMPs from insects and mammals. (A) All
known MMPs from the fully genome sequenced ecdysozoan Drosophila melanogaster and humans (Deuterostomia) were aligned
with the Schmidtea-MMP (AY068367) and the active site sequences are shown (MMP active site consensus sequence:
HEXGHXXGXXHS). (B) A Bayesian protein tree was generated and we found that the Schmidtea-MMP grouped together
with the MMP from H. vulgaris (AAD45804) nearest to MMP-1 from D. melanogaster. UniProt accession numbers for MMPs are:
Drosophila1, Q9GTK3; Drosophila2, Q8MPP3; Human19, Q99542; Human28, Q9H239; Human11, P24347; Human21,

major vault protein and vWF protein in H. vulgaris). In
addition, using the SSH-method we have recently identified novel insect antimicrobial peptides among which
some of them emerged as promising templates for the
rational design of second generation antibiotics [57] or as
transgenes for the generation of disease-resistant crops
[58]. Hence, identified immunity-related genes from

Schmidtea and Hydra may have also potential therapeutic
value. Additionally, it will be a challenge to elucidate
physiological functions of the presently identified genes
during immune responses and homeostasis and to
employ Schmidtea and Hydra as model organisms for the
investigation of molecular interactions of pathogens with
the host innate immune system.

Construction of subtracted cDNA libraries using the SSH
method
In order to identify genes that are differentially expressed
in response to septic injury we performed the suppression
subtractive hybridization method using RNAs from
immune challenged and untreated S. mediterranea and H.
vulgaris, respectively, the SMART PCR cDNA synthesis Kit
(Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), and the PCR-Select
cDNA subtraction Kit (Clontech), according to the protocols of the manufacturer. Colony PCR of each 288 randomly picked colonies and blot hybridization have been
performed similar as described recently [19].

Quantitative real time RT-PCR analysis of selected
Schmidtea genes that are up-regulated in response to
septic wounding. The mRNA levels of selected genes in
immune challenged animals (gray bars) were determined and
are shown relative to their expression levels in untreated
animals (black bars). The expression of the house-keeping
gene 18S rRNA was not significantly influenced by the treatment. Results represent mean values of three independent
determinations ± SD. Statistically significant differences were
determined using Student's t-test and are indicated by asterisks (p < 0.05) or the determined p values were inserted.

Methods
Immune challenge of Schmidtea mediterranea and
Hydra vulgaris and RNA isolation
The asexual strain of S. mediterranea (originated from a
fountain in Montjuïc, Barcelona, Spain) was kept at 18°C
in darkness and fed once per week with sheep liver. Oneweek-starved about 7-mm-long animals were used for
experiments. H. vulgaris (Zürich strain, originally isolated
by P. Tardent) was cultured at 18°C as described [59].
Septic wounding was performed by dissecting animals in
two parts using a scalpel in the presence of 50 μg/ml LPS
(purified Escherichia coli endotoxin 0111:B4, Cat. No.:
L2630, Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany). Total RNA was
extracted from 14 h post immune challenged animals
using the TriReagent isolation reagent (Molecular
Research Centre, Cincinnati, Ohio, USA) according to the
instructions of the manufacturer. RNA integrity was confirmed by ethidium bromide gel staining and quantities
were determined spectrophotometrically.

Sequencing and computer analysis of cDNA sequence data
Plasmid isolation of positively screened colonies was performed with the FastPlasmid Mini Kit (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and purified plasmids were custom
sequenced by Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, South-Korea). Blast
[60] was used to identify corresponding gene sequences in
the public sequence databases. InterProScan [61] was
used for an integrated search in PROSITE, Pfam, and
PRINTS databases at EMBL-European Bioinformatics
Institute and to predict signal sequences and transmembrane regions.
Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analysis
Multiple sequence alignments were computed using
blosum62 program [62]. For phylogenetic reconstruction,
we used the software package MrBayes 3.1.2 [63] which
combines Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte
Carlo convergence acceleration techniques known as
Metropolis coupling. The best fixed-rate model of amino
acid evolution was determined by model jumping among
nine possible models. The model with the overall highest
posterior probability was WAG model [64] for the MMPs
after 106 generations and for calreticulins after 2 × 106 generations. We used convergence diagnostic (i.e., the standard deviation of split frequencies) to determine whether
the run length is sufficient. The average standard deviation
of split frequencies was 0.0051 for MMPs and 0.0023 for
the calreticulins. This indicated that the two chains that
were run converged on similar results in all cases. The
50% majority rule tree presented here was constructed
from all sampled trees with the first 25% of all trees
ignored as burn in. Posterior probabilities plotted at the
nodes can be interpreted as the probability that the tree or
clade is correct [65].
Quantitative real-time PCR
Quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed with the
real-time PCR system Mx3000P (Stratagene, La Jolla, California, USA) using the FullVelocity SYBR® Green QRTPCR Master Mix (Stratagene), according to the protocols
of the manufacturer. 50 pg of RNA per reaction were used
to amplify 18S rRNA and 50 ng of RNA per reaction to
