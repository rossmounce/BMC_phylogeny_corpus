Abstract
Background: Tetrapods exhibit great diversity in limb structures among species and also between
forelimbs and hindlimbs within species, diversity which frequently correlates with locomotor
modes and life history. We aim to examine the potential relation of changes in developmental
timing (heterochrony) to the origin of limb morphological diversity in an explicit comparative and
quantitative framework. In particular, we studied the relative time sequence of development of the
forelimbs versus the hindlimbs in 138 embryos of 14 tetrapod species spanning a diverse
taxonomic, ecomorphological and life-history breadth. Whole-mounts and histological sections
were used to code the appearance of 10 developmental events comprising landmarks of
development from the early bud stage to late chondrogenesis in the forelimb and the
corresponding serial homologues in the hindlimb.
Results: An overall pattern of change across tetrapods can be discerned and appears to be
relatively clade-specific. In the primitive condition, as seen in Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes, the
forelimb/pectoral fin develops earlier than the hindlimb/pelvic fin. This pattern is either retained or
re-evolved in eulipotyphlan insectivores (= shrews, moles, hedgehogs, and solenodons) and taken
to its extreme in marsupials. Although exceptions are known, the two anurans we examined
reversed the pattern and displayed a significant advance in hindlimb development. All other species
examined, including a bat with its greatly enlarged forelimbs modified as wings in the adult, showed
near synchrony in the development of the fore and hindlimbs.

Conclusion: Major heterochronic changes in early limb development and chondrogenesis were
absent within major clades except Lissamphibia, and their presence across vertebrate phylogeny
are not easily correlated with adaptive phenomena related to morphological differences in the adult
fore- and hindlimbs. The apparently conservative nature of this trait means that changes in
chondrogenetic patterns may serve as useful phylogenetic characters at higher taxonomic levels in
tetrapods. Our results highlight the more important role generally played by allometric
heterochrony in this instance to shape adult morphology.

Background
What evolutionary mechanisms are responsible for differences in the relative size of body parts among organisms?
This basic question has long been confronted by biologists, for example, by J. S. Huxley, in his Problems of Relative Growth [1]. When considering the tetrapod limb, one
might ask why the forelimbs are relatively larger or
smaller than the hindlimbs in some species, and how
these differences have arisen during evolution.
Tetrapods exhibit great diversity in limb structures among
species and in differences between fore- and hindlimbs
within species, which typically are correlated with locomotor modes and life history [2]. Among mammals, the
relatively large wings of an adult bat exhibit a striking contrast in size and proportions to its legs, whereas the disparity in most other living eutherians (e.g. mice) is more
modest. Kangaroos represent the opposite situation, having relatively massive hindlimbs. These differences are not
restricted to mammals but characterize tetrapods as a
whole, as evidenced when considering a bird or a frog or
a turtle, or fossils such as Tyranosaurus rex, which has huge
hindlimbs and tiny forelimbs.

A largely unanswered question is how these differences
are reflected in the ontogenetic development of the limbs.
Limbs are one of the best studied systems in both evolution and development [3] and display a sequence of welldefined temporal events, such as formation of the apical
ectodermal ridge (AER) and the chondrification of skeletal elements. We examine here the extent to which features
of
early
limb
development,
especially
chondrogenesis, might be associated with obvious differences in forelimb and hindlimb size or function in the
adult. We concentrate on heterochrony, the evolutionary
change in developmental timing, a process which is
thought to be important and common in evolution [4]. In
particular, we examine the relative timing of developmental events during ontogeny across the phylogeny of the
species examined (sequence heterochrony; sensu [5]).

Results
The average event-pair score (EPS; see Methods) was plotted for each species (Table 1, Fig. 1). The two anurans
(Xenopus, Eleutherodactylus) show average EPS scores significantly less than one, indicating that hindlimb development generally precedes that of the forelimb (noted by
[6,7]). The two birds (Taeniopygia, Gallus) also tend to

Discussion
The relative timing of fore- and hindlimb development is
labile in evolution, but with the observed pattern of
change in timing showing a strong phylogenetic component. Different clades (anurans, diapsids, eutherians and
marsupials) each have evolved characteristic timing relationships (see also Figure 2) that show no apparent correlation to the diverse lifestyles and adult morphologies of
the species within each clade. The relative conservation of
timing relationships within clades in the face of disparate
adaptive needs is particularly striking among eutherians,
which included a flying species (Rousettus), a glider (Cynocephalus), and a terrestrial species (Mus). Although the

show an advance in hindlimb development – small differences between fore- and hindlimb timing can be detected
visually (for example, in the figures of Gallus in [8]) – but
are not significantly different from forelimb-hindlimb
synchrony together with the remaining diapsids Lacerta
and Emys. Among mammals, the marsupials (Trichosurus,
Dasyurus and Sminthopsis) and eulipotyphlan insectivores
(Erinaceus and Talpa) all show significant advances in
forelimb development. The generally smaller forelimb
advances among the remaining eutherian mammals were
not significantly different from synchronous development.

eulipotyphlan insectivores Erinaceus and Talpa do show a
significant forelimb advance within and with respect to
other eutherian mammals, this pattern is also consistent
for the clade despite the different locomotory modes of
the exemplars (terrestrial and fossorial, respectively). In
short, the strong selection for modification of the adult
limb morphology in eutherians did not produce correlated changes in the relative timing of forelimb-hindlimb
development.
The only exceptions to the general pattern of cladedependent conservation across tetrapods that we are
aware of occur in lissamphibians. In anurans, the limbs
develop approximately in synchrony in Rana temporaria
[9] in contrast to the hindlimb acceleration found in the
two species we examined. Among other lissamphibians, it
is known that in some urodeles such as the smooth newt
Triturus vulgaris, the forelimb is so accelerated relative to
the hindlimb that it is chondrified before the bud of the
latter has even appeared [10]. Forelimb advanced over the
hindlimb also characterizes the Iberian ribbed newt Pleurodeles watl [11]. In other urodeles, such as the Siberian
newt Salamandrella keyserlingii [12] and the clawed salamander Onychodactylus japonica [13], the forelimb is only
marginally advanced if at all or, as in the Mexican plethodontid Chiropterotriton magnipes, the two limbs reportedly
develop more or less simultaneously [14]. Increased species sampling may reveal yet additional variation within
Lissamphibia.
Altogether, there was little evidence that adaptations of
the adult tetrapod limb were associated with fore-/hindlimb sequence heterochrony during chondrogenesis.
Instead, it appears that post-chondrogenic differences in
growth rate (i.e., allometric heterochrony) play a more
deciding role in shaping the final adult morphology of the
tetrapod limb. A cogent example are marsupials, which
often display a much larger hindlimb in adults despite the
extreme acceleration of forelimb development in
embryos. Similarly, the bat actually displayed the least
degree of forelimb acceleration among the eutherians
studied, despite the forelimbs being greatly enlarged and
modified as wings in the adult. This morphology appears
to derive from allometric heterochrony instead: the initially conserved pattern of chondrogenesis is followed by
accelerated chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation,
with increased Bmp2 expression and Bmp signalling [15].
A similar phenomenon of allometric and not sequence
heterochrony was hypothesized by Jeffery et al. [16] to
account for eye development in the spectral tarsier (Tarsius
spectrum), a nocturnal primate with the largest relative
eye-size among mammals.
An important question, therefore, is what is driving the
changes in the early pattern of chondrogenesis among the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/182

major tetrapod clades, especially in light of the apparent
conservation of this trait within most of them. Similar
developmental pathways are responsible for the patterning and growth of fore- and hindlimbs, and covariation
between both has been recorded statistically at different
levels of the phylogenetic hierarchy in adults [17]. Yet, our
study shows that heterochronic changes and dissociation
have still occurred across major tetrapod clades and
within lissamphibians to occasionally override the common mechanisms underlying limb development.
One possible explanation for the inferred transformations
is that the different patterns are directly adaptive for the
embryo. This has been hypothesized for marsupials and
monotremes, where the greatly accelerated forelimb
development has been linked to the necessity for the
embryo to climb to the mother's marsupium to attach to
a teat for further development [5]. Similarly, marsupials
show another one of the few, clear instances of sequence
heterochrony in mammals, with many cranial structures
associated with feeding in the pouch also showing
advanced development [5,18,19]. Similar adaptive explanations are lacking for the remaining species, however.
This is particularly true for the two anurans examined here
(Eleutherodactylus, Xenopus), which show a conserved pattern despite their very different developmental modes
(direct versus indirect, respectively). Altogether, adaptive
explanations seem difficult to postulate in general and for
the amniotes in particular, the embryos of which develop
in the protected environment of the cleidoic egg and so
might be evolutionarily 'privileged' (sensu [20]) and
shielded from diversifying selection.
An alternative, but not mutually exclusive, explanation is
the presence of developmental 'constraints' [21] or that
the overall pattern is the 'by-product' of other developmental processes. Although our findings are consistent
with the existence of such constraints, they in no way can
be taken as evidence of their existence.
We would add that the general pattern of fore- and hindlimb developmental timing we present based on 10 developmental landmarks belies its actual complexity. In
Dasyurus, for example, although the forelimb buds appear
before those of the hindlimb, a clear hindlimb bud is
present throughout most of forelimb development. However, chondrogenesis does not start in the hindlimb buds
until forelimb development is nearly complete. The initial
timing difference between the appearance of fore- and
hindlimb buds correlates with the strong craniocaudal
developmental gradient observed at early stages of development [22]. However, the failure of the hindlimb bud to
progress after its initial formation (a period of developmental 'dormancy'), is likely to be caused by more local

factors, effectively maintaining a viable limb-bud whilst
temporarily suspending outgrowth.

Conclusion
We find that the relative timing of forelimb versus hindlimb development varies widely between major vertebrate
clades. However, such forelimb-hindlimb sequence heterochronies are largely absent within major clades, the Lissamphibia forming a notable exception. The sequence
differences that we did note between fore- and hindlimbs
were not easy to explain in terms of morphological differences in the adult fore- and hindlimbs. Rather, the latter
were more likely explained by allometric growth differences. The apparently conservative nature of forelimb versus hindlimb timing may mean that of skeletal
chondrogenesis sequences could provide useful phylogenetic characters at higher taxonomic levels in tetrapods.
Our data, and those summarized in Rabl [23] and Richardson [24] allow an initial attempt to reconstruct the
evolution of forelimb-hindlimb heterochrony across
tetrapods (Figure 2). The primitive tetrapod condition
appears to be for the forelimb to be advanced over the
hindlimb (see also [25]). This condition characterizes the
primitive condition for the homologous structures (the
pectoral and pelvic fins, although many tetrapod autopodial structures are most likely absent in fishes [26]) in
Chondrichthyes and Osteichthyes [24]. Thereafter, the
evolution of this trait is equivocal (as indicated by the
black branches in Figure 2), with two equally parsimonious solutions. One solution is for the forelimb advance to
be retained ancestrally throughout tetrapods, with the
individual groups (anurans, diapsids, marsupials, Rousettus, and Mus + Cynocephalus) independently deviating
from this pattern. The other solution is for a hindlimb

advance to be a shared derived feature (synapomorphy) of
amniotes, with marsupials and eulipotyphlan insectivores
independently regaining the primitive tetrapod hindlimb
advance.
Additional data will help clarify this picture, both by testing the reality of the apparent clade-specificity of forelimb-hindlimb heterochrony and by hopefully resolving
outstanding regions of uncertainty. Key among the latter
is within urodeles, where there is evidence that the pattern
we present might not hold in unsampled species [10-14].

Methods
We analysed developmental sequences in 138 embryos of
14 species, spanning a diverse taxonomic, ecomorphological and life-history breadth. Specimens were obtained
from the Zeilstra and M.K. Richardson collections, Institute of Biology, University of Leiden; Hubrecht Laboratory, Netherlands Institute for Developmental Biology
and Naturalis Museum, Leiden. We used whole-mounts
prepared using standard protocols and viewed through an
orange (G) filter to improve the contrast. Some histological sections were made to ensure that differences in staining time did not affect the scoring of skeletal elements. All
had been collected in accordance with local ethical rules.
Work on Eleutherodactylus was approved by the Harvard
University, Faculty of Arts & Sciences, Standing Committee on the use of Animals in Research and Teaching, animal experimentation protocol (AEP) 99-09.
A total of 20 events was scored (Table 2), providing landmarks of development from the early bud stage to late
chondrogenic events. All specimens were scored by JEJ. As
a control, MKR independently scored a subset of several
species; results were identical. The score '0' was assigned if

an event had not yet occurred, and '2' if it had occurred.
The score '1' was used to indicate an intermediate phase,
such as if a cartilage element was stained but lacked distinct boundaries (i.e., it was a diffuse patch that graded
imperceptibly into the surrounding tissue). We assumed
the homology of the events, both amongst species (primary homology), and between the fore- and hindlimbs of
individuals (serial homology).
Stylopodal and zeugopodal elements have clear homologues between the fore and hindlimbs (humerus/femur,
radius/tibia and ulna/fibula). A basipodial element
(ulnare/fibulare) also could be identified in most species.
The total number of phalanges on a particular digit, however, varies amongst species. We therefore chose to record
only the most proximal and distal phalanges, which provide proximal and distal landmarks for chondrogenesis in
a given digit. The AER is absent in one of the anuran species considered here (Eleutherodactylus coqui; [7]), and very
reduced in the other (Xenopus laevis; [27]).
Autopodials of the species studied vary in the number and
pattern of prechondrogenic primordia, the pattern of
fusion or regression during development, and in adult
morphology (e.g., the numbers of digits and phalanges).
We resolved these difficulties by looking at common (possibly plesiomorphic) patterns of development. In the forelimb, the digit adjacent to the ulna and ulnare is the first
to develop [28,29]. We therefore selected this digit (and
its associated metacarpal) as a proxy for overall digital
development. A similar pattern is seen in the hindlimb
with respect to the fibula and fibulare. In pentadactyl
amniotes this digit invariably is digit IV.
Reconstructing the developmental sequence
The embryonic age was unknown for most specimens.
Even so, the very existence of intraspecific heterochrony
means that absolute age usually cannot be considered to
be a reliable criterion for ordering specimens in a developmental sequence [30]. We therefore used the parsimonybased 'Ontogenetic Sequence Analysis' (OSA [31]) on the
limb character distribution amongst the specimens to find
the most parsimonious developmental sequence for each
species. OSA provides a rigorous framework for optimizing variations (polymorphisms) in the developmental
sequence of a species to yield a single, consensus
sequence. It relies on two assumed characteristics of development: (1) progressiveness – for any set of events, it is
possible to conceive an early embryo in which none of the
events has occurred, and a late embryo in which all the
events have occurred; and (2) irreversibility – the same
event cannot occur twice to the same organ.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/182

potentially equivalent scores (when missing data are
taken into account). Such embryos were excluded from
the analysis to reduce the computational time for OSA
without the loss of any novel information.
Intraspecific developmental rates
Comparisons of the relative rates of development between
fore- and hindlimbs within each species were made using
the event-pair method. This method encodes the relative
timing between any two developmental events, with 0
indicating that event A occurred before event B, 1 indicating that both occurred simultaneously, and 2 indicating
that event B occurred first. To highlight differential rates of
development between the limbs without regard to any
sequence changes within each limb we compared the 100
non-redundant event-pairs involving each homologous
forelimb and hindlimb event (for a data set of N serially
homologous events = N2; N = 10 here). All event pairs
were scored from the standard 'perspective' of hindlimbevent vs. forelimb-event (i.e., rather than forelimb event
vs. hindlimb event; cf. [18]).

The average event-pair score (EPS; i.e. the sum of all eventpair scores divided by the number of event-pairs) was analyzed to describe the overall timing of fore- and hindlimb
development in each species. If fore- and hindlimbs
developed synchronously, there would be 10 'simultaneous' event-pair scores (one for every pair of serially
homologous events, each scoring 1) and 45 scores each of
'before' (scoring 0) and 'after' (scoring 2). Thus, the average value of EPS would be (10 × 1 + 45 × 0 + 45 × 2)/100
= 1. If the forelimb moved late relative to the hindlimb,
the ratio of 'before' to 'after' scores would decrease, moving the average EPScloser to zero. Conversely, if the forelimb moved early relative to the hindlimb, the ratio of
'before' to 'after' scores would increase, moving the average EPS closer to two. The average EPS therefore provides
an indicator of the relative timing of fore- and hindlimb
development.
It is not clear precisely how the average EPS is affected by
lack of resolution in a developmental sequence, but, in
general, an increased number of simultaneous scores will
tend to push the value towards one. Any lack of resolution
is more likely to affect comparisons of events within the
forelimb or the hindlimb, rather than the homologous
events between the limbs, especially when the two sets of
limbs develop asynchronously.
