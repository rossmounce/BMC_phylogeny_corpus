Abstract
Background: Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are products of heat shock response and of other
stress responses, and ubiquitous in all three domains of life, archaea, bacteria, and eukarya. They
mainly function as molecular chaperones to protect proteins from being denatured in extreme
conditions. Study on insect sHSPs could provide some insights into evolution of insects that have
adapted to diverse niches in the world.
Results: Taking advantage of the newly assembled genome sequence, we performed a genomewide analysis of the candidate sHSP genes in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. Based on known silkworm
sHSP sequences, we identified 16 silkworm sHSP genes. Most of them are distributed on two
silkworm chromosomes 5 and 27, respectively. 15 of 16 silkworm sHSPs have expression evidence.
The comparative analysis of insect sHSPs from B. mori, Drosophila melanogaster, Apis mellifera,
Tribolium castaneum, and Anopheles gambiae revealed that there is only one orthologous cluster
whereas remaining clusters are species-specific on the phylogenetic tree. This suggested that most
of sHSPs might have diverged in function across insects investigated. In addition, the data presented
in this study also revealed that sHSPs in the insect orthologous cluster are highly conserved in both
sequence and expression pattern. In sum, insect sHSPs show a completely different evolutionary
pattern from that found in vertebrate sHSPs.
Conclusion: B. mori has the largest number of insect sHSP genes characterized to date, including
16 genes. The inference that most species-specific sHSPs might have diverged in function across
insects investigated will help us understand the adaptability of these insects to diverse
environments.

Background
It was in Drosophila that researchers observed the phenomenon of heat shock response (HSR) at the first time [1].

Then these proteins highly expressed in thermal stress
were defined as heat shock proteins (HSPs). Previous
studies suggest that the small heat shock proteins (sHSPs)

are abundant and ubiquitous in almost all organisms,
from bacteria to algae with single cell to the higher organisms including human [2-5]. HSPs can be divided into five
families, including HSP100, HSP90, HSP70, HSP60, and
sHSP. This classification is mainly based on the molecular
weight as well as the homologous relationship of HSPs.
All of these families are conserved, except for sHSP family
that is more diverse than other four. However, there are
some common characteristics in the function and structure of sHSP. The molecular weights of sHSPs range from
12 kDa to 42 kDa, usually bellow 30 kDa [2,4]. The sHSPs
have an α-crystalling domain comprising about 100
amino acid residues, which is the conserved structure of
all sHSP sequences [6-8]. There is a conserved β-sheet
sandwich in sHSP secondary structure, and it is these βsheet structures that help several subunits of sHSP to form
a large oligomer [2,9,10]. This stable multimeric structure
formed by sHSPs has the function of molecular chaperone, which binds to the proteins and prevents them from
thermal denaturation [10-12]. The low molecular weight,
the conserved secondary structure, and protein domain
are principal features used to identify a protein belonging
to sHSP family.
In addition to functioning as molecular chaperones to
protect proteins from being denatured in high temperature stress [10,13], sHSPs can also develop the protection
function in the conditions of other stresses, such as cold,
drought, oxidation, hypertonic stress, UV, and heavy metals [4,14], even high population density of organisms
[15]. The HSPs including sHSPs are playing the part of
chaperone function not only in stress conditions, but also
in normal development [13]. Although the sHSP family
has relatively conserved function of molecular chaperone
and the C-terminal of these proteins harbors the conserved α-crystalling domain, the N-terminal sequences of
these proteins are variable. This indicates that the conserved C-terminal sequence is a significant part for sustaining the chaperone and other functions of sHSP in cells
or organisms whereas the diverse N-terminal sequences
may be associated with the diverse expressions, functions,
and evolutionary patterns among sHSPs.
There have been numerous studies on HSPs in bacteria,
algae, plant, amphibians, birds, and mammalian, especially in the model organisms of Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila
melanogaster, zebra fish, Mus musculus[3-5]. Although the
heat shock response was fist discovered in insect [1], the
study of HSP in insects, especially for sHSP, is not as
extensive and penetrating as in other organisms. sHSPs
primarily have chaperone activity and reflect the response
machine of organisms to some extreme stresses existing in
environment. Insects are one of the most successful organisms in the world and have a strong ability to adapt to various habitats. So the study of insect sHSP is necessary.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/215

In this study, we first identified the sHSP genes of Bombyx
mori based on the new assembly of the silkworm genome
sequence [16]http://silkworm.swu.edu.cn/silkdb/. Then
we performed comparative analyses with the sHSPs from
other four insects whose complete genome sequences are
available. It was found that there is an orthologous cluster
including five sHSP genes that come from each of five
insects. This group of genes is so conserved in sequence
among insects, which is in sharp contrast to the other
sHSP genes that are species-specific and show the evolutionary pattern of lineage-specific expansion. In addition,
the expression patterns of the silkworm sHSPs were investigated by available microarray data. Our data provide
some new insights into evolution and functions of the
insect sHSPs.

Results
sHSP genes in silkworm and other insects
Previous studies have reported 7 silkworm sHSP genes
[17-19]. Using these known sHSP sequences as queries, in
total we identified 16 sHSP genes in silkworm through
homology search (Table 1). The molecular weight of each
silkworm sHSP gene was predicted by the online tool of
ExPASy website. Finally, we named these genes using their
predicted molecular weights, respectively.

The sHSP genes have conserved protein secondary structure and functional domain [13]. The molecular weight of
sHSP is usually between 12 kDa to 42 kDa [2]. There is an
α-crystalling domain comprising of about 100 amino acid
residues in secondary structure of silkworm sHSPs [6-8].
Silkworm has 16 sHSP genes, which is the largest number
in five insects investigated. α-crystalling domain harbors 9
β-sheet sandwich structures (Figure 1). These β-sheets are
numbered with β2 to β10 (Figure 1) which correspond to
the secondary structure of sHSP16.9 in wheat, Triticum
aestivum [9] and sHSP25 in Ca. elegans [5]. These features
in sequence structure can be used to identify the candidate
genes. It will be seen from Figure 1 that the candidates
identified in this study are indeed silkworm sHSP genes.
Compared with the conserved structure of C-terminal, the
N-terminal regions of silkworm sHSP genes are relatively
divergent in sequence length and order. However, there
are still some conserved amino acid residues in N-terminal.
B. mori has 28 chromosome pairs. It can be known from
Table 1 that the genes encoding sHSPs were distributed on
at least four chromosomes 27, 5, 19, and 13. Because the
scaffolds nscaf2803 and scaffold2784 could not be
located on the chromosomes in current version of the silkworm genome sequence, the locations of Bm21.6 (in
nscaf2803) and Bm20.1 (in scaffold2784) were not determined. It is clear that the distribution of the silkworm
sHSP genes in the genome is not homogeneous. There are
six sHSP genes located on the silkworm chromosome 27,

five genes on chromosome 5, two genes on chromosome
19, and only one gene on chromosome 13. In addition,
we found that genes distributed on the chromosomes 27
and 5 have no intron. One gene, Bm22.6 distributed on
chromosome 19, contains one intron (the intron length is
2982 bp), and another one, Bm21.4 distributed on chromosome 13, contains two introns (the lengths are 5263
bp and 620 bp, respectively). Compared with the fulllength (400~750 bp) of most of the silkworm sHSP genes,
these two genes containing introns are relatively too long,
especially for Bm21.4. In the previous report [18], the
complete gene sequence of Bm21.4 could not be amplified through PCR method using silkworm genomic DNA
as template. Probably, this is due to existence of a relatively big intron. Bm22.6, Bm21.4, and Bm42.3 are different from the other silkworm sHSP genes in chromosome
location and the existence of intron. It can be seen from
Table 1 that Bm20.8, Bm20.4, Bm19.1, and Bm19.9 are
tandem arranged on the middle region of chromosome
27 and there is no any other gene interrupting this
genomic region. Bm 23.8 is located on the near end of
chromosome 27. However, only two of five sHSP genes
on chromosome 5 are tightly tandem arranged (Table 1
and Additional file 1).
The sHSP genes of other four insects, D. melanogaster, Ap.
mellifera, T. castaneum, and An. gambiae, are listed in Table

2. We renamed these genes with their molecular weights.
It was found that D. melanogaster has 11 sHSP genes, Ap.
mellifera and T. castaneum have 10 genes, respectively, and
An. gambiae has 7 genes. The distribution patterns of the
sHSP genes in the genomes of four insects are similar to
that in the silkworm genome. That is, most of sHSP genes
in each organism are located on one chromosome, for
example, chromosome 3 of D. melanogaster (8 sHSP
genes), chromosome 2 of Ap. mellifera (8 genes), chromosome 8 of T. castaneum (7 genes), and chromosome 2 of
An. gambiae (6 genes). The remaining two or three sHSP
genes are distributed on other chromosomes. Furthermore, most sHSP genes located on one chromosome are
usually tandem arranged, and the remaining one or two
sHSP genes are separately distributed on the same chromosome with some distances from the tandem set (Table
2 and Additional file 1). Although the number of tandem
arranged genes varies among the insects, the chromosomes harboring most sHSP genes in each species exhibit
a similar gene distribution pattern.
Silkworm has the largest number of sHSP genes (16
genes) whereas An. gambiae has the least number of sHSP
genes (7 genes) among the insects investigated. With the
information of chromosome location and intron number,
we can roughly divide the sHSP genes into two types for
each of the species. One is that the genes clustered on the

same chromosome (two chromosomes for silkworm)
tend to have no intron and the other is that the genes (1
to 3 genes) dispersed on chromosomes tend to have
intron.
We also performed homology search in the genome of S.
cerevisia and found two genes that have high identity with
silkworm sHSP genes. One is Scer23.9, located on the
chromosome 2. This gene has been reported previously
and its NCBI accession number is NP_009628.1. We used
it as the outgroup in the phylogenetic analyses.
Phylogenetic analysis of insect sHSP genes
Programs MrBayes v.3.1.2 and MEGA 4.0 were used to
reconstruct Bayesian and NJ phylogenetic trees for the
insect sHSP genes. The topologies of phylogenetic trees
obtained by different approaches are similar. So, only the
Bayesian tree is shown in Figure 2 (additional file 2).

Figure 2 shows that there are two types of clusters on the
phylogenetic tree. One type is an orthologous cluster with
a very high supporting value measured by the posterior
probability, which includes five members that come from
each of five insects, respectively. These genes all have at
least two introns and dispersed in genomes without any
linkage relationships to other sHSP genes. The sHSP genes
of D. melanogaster (Dmel20.8) and An. gambiae
(Agam20.9) are located on the chromosome X, which is
the sex chromosome. The branching pattern of the orthologous cluster shows that Dmel20.8 and Agam20.9 are
closer in five orthologous genes and Amel25.6 and
Tcas21.8b are closer. Surprisingly, Bm21.4 did not cluster
closely to Diptera but was placed on the basal of the cluster, which is not consistent with the result of a recent study
on insect molecular systematics [20]. This may imply that
Bm21.4 might have experienced a specific evolutionary
process.

The other type on the phylogenetic tree is species-specific
clusters as a result of lineage-specific expansion. Silkworm-specific cluster includes 12 sHSP genes but has a
relative low support value. Most of these genes are located
on two chromosomes 5 and 27, however, Bm27.4 and
Bm26.6 located on chromosome 5 are not included in
this cluster. Bm42.3 is also contained in this cluster.
The posterior probabilities of the species-specific clusters
in other four insects are higher (Figure 2). In Ap. mellifera,

the species-specific cluster contains 7 sHSP genes and all
these genes are distributed on chromosome 2. Additionally, 6 of these genes have no intron except Amel21.3 contains one intron. It is interesting that Amel22.0 located on
chromosome 2 and with three introns is not the member
of this cluster. In D. melanogaster, sHSP genes distributed
on the left arm of chromosome 3 are all included in the

chromosome 2 is also in this cluster. All these genes have
no intron. Most of members of the species-specific cluster

of T. castaneum sHSP are located on chromosome 8 and
only Tcas22.2 is on chromosome 3. They are all single
exon genes. Three sHSP genes on the same chromosome
of An. gambiae formed a cluster and they all have no
intron. In addition, there are other sHSP specific genes in
An. gambiae, including Agam21.7, Agam21.6, and
Agam23.5b. These three genes have two or three introns
and are also located on chromosome 2. All tandem
arranged genes of each species except An. gambiae are
included in the species-specific cluster (Table 1, Table 2
and Figure 2).
Most strikingly, most members in each of species-specific
clusters are usually distributed on the same chromosome
in a tandem manner. This gene expansion may be the
result of gene duplication events created by unequal crossing over.
The orthologous sHSP genes in insects
The phylogenetic analysis of sHSP genes in five insects
reveals an orthologous cluster (Figure 2). This cluster contains five sHSP genes corresponding to five insects, respectively (Figure 3). These sHSPs have similar sequence
lengths of 183 to 190 amino acid residues except that
Amel25.6 has an extra and distinct exon containing 38
amino acid residues. The amino acid sequences of these
orthologous sHSPs are highly conserved not only in the Cterminal region of α-crystalling domain with chaperone
function but also in the N-terminal sequences that are
more variable in other sHSP genes (Figure 1 and 3). The
five conserved sHSP genes all have introns: Bm21.4 and
Agam20.9 have two introns and Dmel20.8, Tcas21.8b,
and Amel25.6 have three. Generally speaking, there are
four intron positions in the alignment of the orthologous
sHSP gene sequences. Intron 1 is conserved in these five
genes and has phase 2. Intron 2 only exists in honeybee
orthologous sHSP and also has phase 2. Intron 3 is special
for D. melanogaster and An. gambiae, both are Diptera.
Intron 4 is also conserved in orthologous sHSP genes of
these insects except An. gambiae which has no intron in
this position. Given that the orthologous sHSP genes have
the conserved features in sequence, the intron position as
well as the special and distinct phylogenetic relationships
with other sHSP genes, we suppose that these sHSP genes
are conserved in function across insects. They may play
important roles in basic biological processes.

We performed blast searching Genbank with these orthologous sHSP sequences to look for orthologous sHSPs in
other insects or distant species. We did find that many
other insects have this orthologous gene, such as Acyrthosiphon pisum (Accession no. XP_001949402), Aedes aegypti
Culex
quinquefasciatus
(XP_001657982),
(XM_001870731), Heliconius erato (ABS57447), Locusta
migratoria (ABC84493), and Nasonia vitripennis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/215

(XP_001607669). Furthermore, an arthropods of Ixodes
scapularis (EEC06453) belonging to Arachnoidea and four
nematoda organisms of Caenorhabditis
briggsae
(XP_001676833), C. elegans (NP_001024374), Brugia
malayi (U48407) and Dirofilaria immitis (AAB08736) also
contain the orthologous sHSP genes which are slightly
divergent from the insect orthologs. Compared with the
five orthologous sHSP genes in Figure 2, the homologous
genes mentioned above have not only high identity but
also a conserved N-terminal, which is the principal structure characteristic of the genes in the orthologous cluster
(Additional file 3). So, this kind of orthologous genes
exists not only in insects but also in other invertebrates.
To confirm whether the orthologous group genes exist in
vertebrate, we reconstructed a larger phylogenetic tree
including sHSP genes from above five insects, nematode,
amphioxus, mouse and human (Additional file 4). The
sequences of sHSP genes in nematode, mouse and human
came from previous studies [5,21,22]. 14 amphioxus
sHSP genes were obtained by searching the genome of
Branchiostoma floridae [23] using blast method. The phylogenetic analysis results indicated that, as expectation, a
nematode sHSP gene Ce25 was included in the highly
supported orthologous cluster but the human and mouse
sHSP genes were not in it. However, the HsapHspB11
from Human and MmusHSPB11 from mouse as well as
two sHSP genes from amphioxus formed a cluster
although the support value is low. Furthermore, this cluster seems to be close to the orthologous group (Additional
file 4). Therefore, it appears that a kind of highly conserved sHSP genes may exist even in vertebrates. In addition, we observed that there are many orthologous sHSP
clusters between human and mouse, which is consistent
with previous studies [21,22].
The species specific sHSP genes in insects, especially in the
silkworm
Our study revealed that most insect sHSP genes are species-specific (Figure 2). The silkworm contains the most
number of the species-specific sHSPs. They all have a conserved α-crystalling domain and a diversified N-terminal
region. Whether there are divergent expression patterns in
these paralogous genes is worthy to be detected for this
domesticated insect, B. mori.

We searched for EST evidences of sHSP genes through
SilkDB [24]. 14 silkworm sHSP genes have complete EST
sequences except Bm21.6 and Bm42.3. But Bm21.6 had
been cloned in previous studies, as well as the genes of
Bm19.9 [17,18], Bm23.8, Bm20.8, Bm20.4, Bm21.4, and
Bm20.1 [18], Bm24.2 [19], Bm19.1, Bm15.7, Bm 22.6,
Bm27.4, Bm20.2, and Bm19.5 (not published). So, 15
silkworm sHSP genes are certainly transcribed. In fact,
there is no EST sequence associated with Bm42.3. Several

possible reasons may explain the absence of EST evidence
for Bm42.3. One is that this candidate silkworm sHSP
gene is not expressed in usual conditions or its expression
is too weak to be detected. Another is that it might have
lost its regulatory elements. All of these should be confirmed in future.
We also investigated the expression patterns of sHSP
genes in silkworm through the microarray data in
BmMDB [25]. The database contains the expression information for more than twenty thousands genes in 9 silkworm tissues in day 3 of the fifth instar. However, all of
the expression data were obtained in a normal condition.
One candidate sHSP gene in silkworm, Bm42.3, is not
available in the database. So there are 15 silkworm sHSP
genes that have expression information of different tissues
(Figure 4). It can be seen from Figure 4 that the male and
female clustered together in each tissue, suggesting that

the sHSP expression patterns of male and female were
similar in most of the tissues. However, there are some
female upregulated sHSP genes, implying the sexually distinct expression pattern in silkworm [25], for example,
hsp20.8 and hsp19.9 in A/MSG, and hsp20.8, hsp20.1,
hsp19.9 in the PSG (Figure 4). In addition, Bm19.1 and
Bm22.6 had relatively high expression levels in integument, head and midgut. Bm20.1, Bm20.4 and Bm27.4
were highly expressed in gonad, either in testis or in ovary.
These sHSP genes expressed in special tissues without
stress may play an important role in keeping the normal
functions of the cell and tissues.

Discussion
In this study, we first identified 16 silkworm sHSP genes
based on the new assembly of the B. mori genome
sequence [16], which is the largest number of the sHSPs
of five insects in different orders that whole genome

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:215

sequences are available. Previous study based on six silkworm sHSP genes suggested that the sHSP genes in the
silkworm may be classified into two groups [18]. Similarly, the comparative analysis of sHSPs in five insects
revealed that there are two types of clusters of insect
sHSPs: one is orthologous and the other is species-specific. Interestingly, there is one orthologous cluster that
includes one sHSP from each insect whereas most insect
sHSPs are species-specific (Figure 2). These results suggested that most insect sHSPs might have experienced lineage-specific expansion and diverged in function at least
amongst insect orders. Nevertheless, a few insect sHSPs
such as those in orthologous cluster are highly conserved
in whole sequence as well as in gene structure, suggesting
that they may also have highly conserved function. The
phylogenetic relation of the orthologous cluster may be
interpreted as the speciation history.
Most members of species-specific cluster are tandem
arranged genes in each insect and there is no orthologous
relationship between tandem genes of different insects.
This case may occur if a primitive tandem set with several
genes existed in the ancient of the five insects, subsequently, frequent and general gene conversion events
homogenize the tandem sHSP genes in each insect after
the speciation, finally the originally orthologous sHSP
genes became species-specific. So we estimated the gene
conversion events of sHSP genes in each insect with Gene-

geneconv/[26]. Surprisingly, although the P values are
below 0.01, the predicted gene conversion nucleotide residues are no longer than 40 bp in our tests (most are
below 25 bp) except a gene pair in the silkworm of
Bm20.8 and Bm 20.4 (P value, 0.001; length, 128 bp).
These results imply that gene conversion is not the major
mechanism explaining the topology in Figure 2. Therefore, our observations do not support the assumption
above. Members of species-specific cluster or tandem
arranged genes might be the result of independent gene
expansion occurred during evolution of each insect.
The gene expansion process may associate with gene
duplication and loss events, which are known as a birthand-death model. This model was successfully used to
interpret some evolutionary process of most gene families
including HSP70 and cytochrome P450 [27,28]. If this is
the case, Figure 2 suggests that some gene duplication
events of sHSPs occurred before the radiation of insects,
and that one or two copies experienced lineage-specific
expansions through successive gene duplications after the
radiation of insects.
The tandem arranged pattern of sHSP genes is not exclusive in insects. For example, sHSP16 genes in C. elegans
and C. briggsae also show similar pattern [5]. The tandem
repeats of sHSP genes may facilitate organisms to rapidly
respond to changing environmental conditions because
of regulation reason. All the five insects have independently developed this strategy for sHSP genes, which is similar to the convergent duplication of the proneural genes
in insects [29]. However, the 10 sHSP genes in human are
separately distributed on eight chromosomes [21]. The
different arranged forms of sHSP genes may reflect different evolutionary processes that organisms experienced.
Tandem sHSP genes may be a better way for insects to regulate gene expressions in diverse environments.
It is known that the sHSPs are members of HSP family
with function of molecular chaperone. They are ubiquitous in all organisms and extremely conserved in the
sequence structure of α-crystalling domain resided in Cterminal. The conserved C-terminal region might be the
result of strongly functional constraint of sHSPs as a
molecular chaperone. sHSPs bind to other cellular proteins in thermal and other extremely devastating stresses,
and protect them from denaturation. They also have functions in protein folding and transportation, the embryo
development and immunization mechanism of organisms. The conservative degrees of sHSP genes are heterogeneous in different protein regions. In general, the Nterminal coding sequences are more variable than C-terminal with the α-crystalling domain. However, the sHSPs
in the orthologous cluster showed high conservation

along whole sequence. The orthologous sHSP gene
(Bm21.4) in silkworm was cloned and found to be not
induced by thermic stress (45°C), and it was expressed
constitutively in normal conditions (room temperature)
in fat body and other tissues of silkworm [18]. The microarray data also revealed the similar expression patterns
(the probe number is sw01265). So Bm21.4 is special in
sequence and expression compared with other silkworm
sHSP genes [18]. These observations suggest that insect
orthologous sHSPs may not be associated with response
of insects to environmental stresses. In contrast, they may
be involved in basically metabolic processes in insects.
One previous study based on the limited number of sHSP
sequences suggested that the phylogenetic relationship of
sHSP genes in insects is quite different from that of other
species or taxonomical groups [6]. Mammals have at least
ten sHSP subfamilies and they also have orthologous
genes in zebrafish [30]. The identified sHSP genes in
amphibians are also orthologous to those of mammals
[31]. In general, there are multiple orthologous sHSP clusters in vertebrate and angiosperm sHSPs also have similar
pattern [4,32]. However, insect sHSP genes principally
show one orthologous cluster that is composed of each
sHSP from each species investigated, and most of the
genes are species-specific (Figure 2). Thus, insect sHSPs
display completely different evolutionary pattern from
that of vertebrates or plants.
To determine whether the evolutionary pattern observed
in five insects is universal for other arthropods and nematode, we searched the GenBank for the orthologous sHSPs
in corresponding species. Indeed, we found orthologous
sHSP genes in many other arthropods and nematode
(Additional file 3). Most of these species are insects, such
as L. migratoria[15], He. erato [33], Ac. pisum, and Ae.
aegypti. These insects cover the orders Lepidoptera,
Hymenoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Coleoptera, and
Orthoptera. This ubiquitous existence in insects suggests
that all of the species of insecta may possess one copy of
this conserved gene in their genomes. There is a species of
Arachnida, I. scapularis, that contains this orthologous
gene. This gene is also detected within each of nine nematode species [34]. A species of chordate, Branchiostoma
lanceolatum, also contains this orthologous sHSP gene
named B1Hsp24.1 (GenBank accession number:
AJ616737) with relatively lower identity [32]. Insecta and
Arachnida belong to the phylum Arthropoda. Furthermore, Arthopods, Branchiostoma, and phylum Nematoda are all invertebrates. So, these orthologous sHSP
genes do exist in Arthropods and Nematode and probably
in all invertebrates.
That insects harbor orthologous sHSP genes is interesting.
To know how these gens are related to the vertebrate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/215

sHSPs, we performed the phylogenetic analysis on the
sHSPs from five insects, nematode, amphioxus, mouse
and human. Although no highly supported orthologous
cluster was found on the phylogenetic tree, it seems that
vertebrates also have the highly conserved sHSPs that are
close to insect orthologs. Therefore, it is important to
understand functions of these conserved sHSPs of different organisms in future.
The orthologous sHSP genes have not only the conserved
sequences but also the conserved gene structure across
insect orders probably and the sequences of α-crystalling
domains in these genes are more conserved than that in
species-specific genes, all of which is the result of strongly
purifying selection during evolution. P27, another orthologous gene of Bm21.4 in Di. immitis, is also constitutively
expressed in male and female adult worms and developmental phase such as L3–L4 molt and is located in hypodermal tissues. Additionally, it is not up-regulated by heat
shock at 43°C [34]. In C. elegans, Ce25 is also constitutively expressed in normal conditions and this protein is
principally located in body wall muscle specially bonding
to vinculin and α-actinin [35]. However, the orthologous
gene in migratory locust, hsp20.6, can regulate its expression associated with the population density, for example,
high density corresponding to an increased expression
[15]. We infer that these orthologous sHSP genes may be
constitutively expressed in organisms and may not be
involved in the heat shock response. It is likely that they
are house-keeping genes and important in the development, adaptability and metabolism of organisms.
Another important feature of insect sHSPs is that most of
them are species-specific in five insects investigated. This
suggested that functions of most sHSPs might have
diverged among the insects, reflecting that the sHSPs
might have contributed to adaptability of insects to different niches. Silkworm has the largest cluster of species-specific sHSPs which includes 12 genes although the cluster
has a relatively low supporting value measured by posterior probability. 12 silkworm species-specific sHSPgenes
diverged in sequences especially in N-terminal region
(Figure 1). There are several previous studies focused on
these proteins [17-19,36-38]. Silkworm sHSP genes
Bm20.4, Bm20.8, Bm19.9, Bm20.1, Bm24.2, Bm23.8,
and Bm19.5 have increased expression by heat shock
stress [17-19,38]. It is the sHSP genes belonging to species-specific cluster that principally participate in heat
shock response of silkworm and other insects. However,
these genes are also expressed in usual conditions without
extreme stress and have distinct expression levels in different tissues of silkworm (Figure 4). The expression of
Bm19.9 is significantly high in testis and ovary [17], and
Bm20.1 is highly expressed in testis of the fifth instar [38].
There are other sHSP genes having high expression inten-

sities in gonad through the microarray data (Figure 4).
Silkworm sHSP genes highly expressed in gonad may play
an important role in the development of germocyte.
Bm19.1, Bm15.7, and Bm23.8 are increasedly expressed
in midgut. Furthermore, Bm22.6, which does not belong
to the species specific cluster, is also highly expressed in
midgut (Figure 4). Additionally, Bm22.6 is one of the 11
genes significantly up-regulated in midgut following the
infection of BmDNV-Z, a densonucleosis virus [39].
Bm22.6 and Bm19.1 are also remarkably expressed in
integument (Figure 4). Integument and midgut are tissues
with immune function. Previous studies suggest that HSPs
may participate in the innate immune responses of silkworm [40]. So the silkworm sHSP genes highly expressed
in midgut or integument may have functions in immune
defense mechanism.
There are some changes in cellular physiology before and
after the heat stress. Bm20.1 principally located in nucleus
and Bm20.8 in cytoplasm, are all transferred to the membrane after heat shock, and then recovered to the previous
subcellular localization in normal conditions. This
implies that sHSP have functions in the membrane structure and metabolism in extremely conditions [41,42].
Silkworm sHSP genes also have been studied in embryonic development of diapause and non-diapause eggs
[43], silkworm parthenogenesis [44], and different silkworm breeds of bivoltine and multivoltine [45]. The studies in heat stress induced pattern, expression diversity in
tissues, and other functions without chaperone of silkworm sHSP genes suggest that there are divergences in the
biological functions among these genes. These speciesspecific sHSP genes may resist harmful stimulus for organisms and participate in the reproduction, development,
and the normal metabolism activities. It is believed that
the diversity and divergence of sHSP genes might have
facilitated the insects adapting to various environments.
The data presented in this study revealed that the majority
of insect sHSP genes in each species are located on one
chromosome except for that most silkworm sHSP genes
are located on two chromosomes 5 and 27. It is possible
that the distribution of most silkworm sHSP genes on
chromosomes 5 and 27 might be the result of split of an
ancient chromosome. However, there is opposed evidence against this scenario, which is that silkworm chromosomes 5 and 28 correspond to one chromosome in He.
erato and silkworm chromosomes 23 and 27 correspond
to another one [33]. So, the expanding process of sHSP
genes in silkworm is complicated. The silkworm has the
most number of sHSP genes, and An. gambiae has the
least. Whether there is relationship between the number
of the sHSP genes and the resistance to thermal or other
stresses is unknown. The multivoltine silkworms are more

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/215

resistant than bivoltine in thermal stress, and the expressions of some sHSP genes in multivoltine breeds are lower
compared with the bivoltine breeds after heat shock at
45°C [45]. The gregarious locust expresses more sHSP
genes than solitary locust due to different population density, and the former have a smaller body size and a weaker
fecundity [15]. Therefore, the sensitivity to heat and other
stresses may influence the development and reproduction
of various voltinism breeds in silkworm.

Conclusion
Based on known silkworm sHSP sequences and the newly
assembled genome sequence, we identified 16 silkworm
sHSP genes. 15 of 16 silkworm sHSPs have expression evidence. The comparative analysis with other insect sHSPs
revealed that there is only one orthologous cluster
whereas remaining clusters are species-specific. Our data
demonstrated that the evolutionary pattern of insect
sHSPs which is different from that found in vertebrates
and will provide some new insight into evolution of insect
sHSPs. It is believed that studies on the evolution, function and mechanism of stress response genes in insects
will help us understand the adaptability of insects to
diverse environments.

Methods
Identification of insect sHSP genes
We first retrieved 6 known sHSP sequences of B. mori from
Genbank [18] and then used these sequences as queries to
search the new assembly of the silkworm genome
sequence in SilkDB http://silkworm.swu.edu.cn/silkdb
for a complete list of the silkworm sHSPs. The E value for
evaluating all sequences in homology search is 10-4.
Finally, we obtained 16 sequences as candidate genes for
the silkworm sHSPs. The other four insect annotated gene
and protein sequences were downloaded from NCBI website http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/. The four insects are D.
melanogaster, Ap. mellifera, T. castaneum, and An. gambiae.
We used above 16 sHSP sequences of B. mori as queries to
perform the same homology search for other insect sHSPs
as above.

One sHSP gene sequences of S. cerevisiae was used as the
outgroup. This sequence was retrieved from Genbank
(Accession no. NP_009628).
The secondary structure and structural domains and
chromosome locations of the insect sHSPs
The information of protein secondary structure and
domain has advantage for helping researchers to understand the function of these proteins. So the structure information of B. mori candidate sHSP genes was predicted by

Phylogenetic analysis
The amino acid sequences of sHSP genes of five insects
were aligned by three methods, clustal X v.1.8, clustal W
v.1.83 [46], and muscle v.3.6 [47]. The resulting alignments were almost identical and one of them was selected
for further analyses. The phylogenetic tree for the insect
sHSPs was first reconstructed by Neighbor-Joining (NJ)
method in which distance was estimated by JTT amino
acid matrix implemented in the program MEGA 4 [48].
The pairwise deletion option was used in the NJ tree
reconstruction and the accuracy of the tree topology was
assessed by bootstrap analysis with 1,000 resampling replicates.

Using the amino acid sequences of the conserved α-crystalling domain with 100 residues, we also reconstructed
the phylogenetic relationship of the insect sHSP genes by
the program MrBayes v.3.1.2 [49]. MrBayes is a program
of reconstructing phylogenetic relationships based on
Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods. This program simulates the posterior distribution of the phylogenetic trees through the method of Metropolis-coupled
Markov Chain Monte Carlo [49]. WAG model was demonstrated to be the best model used in the MrBayes program to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree for the amino
acid sequences of insect sHSPs. After MrBayes program
with WAG model run 6500000 generations, the value of
average standard deviation of split frequencies became
stable below 0.01 and finally reached to 0.007103 at the
end of the running. So, the early 3500000 generations
data were seen as the burnin, which were deleted in the
analysis of the results. All the trees are rooted by the sHSP
gene sequence of S. cerevisiae, scer23.9.
Expression information based on microarray database
B. mori microarray database http://silkworm.swu.edu.cn/
microarray/ is composed of expression data for 22987
probes of 9 silkworm tissues on day 3 of the fifth instar in
silkworm [25]. We used blastn search to obtain expression
information of each silkworm sHSP gene in several tissues
at normal or some stress conditions. We also searched the
EST data for the silkworm sHSP genes in SilkDB to confirm whether these genes identified from the genome
search approach are expressed in the organism or not
