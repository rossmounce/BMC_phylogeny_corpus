Abstract
Background: As numerous diseases involve errors in signal transduction, modern therapeutics
often target proteins involved in cellular signaling. Interpretation of the activity of signaling
pathways during disease development or therapeutic intervention would assist in drug
development, design of therapy, and target identification. Microarrays provide a global measure of
cellular response, however linking these responses to signaling pathways requires an analytic
approach tuned to the underlying biology. An ongoing issue in pattern recognition in microarrays
has been how to determine the number of patterns (or clusters) to use for data interpretation, and
this is a critical issue as measures of statistical significance in gene ontology or pathways rely on
proper separation of genes into groups.
Results: Here we introduce a method relying on gene annotation coupled to decompositional
analysis of global gene expression data that allows us to estimate specific activity on strongly
coupled signaling pathways and, in some cases, activity of specific signaling proteins. We
demonstrate the technique using the Rosetta yeast deletion mutant data set, decompositional
analysis by Bayesian Decomposition, and annotation analysis using ClutrFree. We determined from
measurements of gene persistence in patterns across multiple potential dimensionalities that 15
basis vectors provides the correct dimensionality for interpreting the data. Using gene ontology
and data on gene regulation in the Saccharomyces Genome Database, we identified the
transcriptional signatures of several cellular processes in yeast, including cell wall creation,
ribosomal disruption, chemical blocking of protein synthesis, and, criticially, individual signatures of
the strongly coupled mating and filamentation pathways.
Conclusion: This works demonstrates that microarray data can provide downstream indicators
of pathway activity either through use of gene ontology or transcription factor databases. This can
be used to investigate the specificity and success of targeted therapeutics as well as to elucidate
signaling activity in normal and disease processes.

Background
Many diseases develop because of errors in signaling, and
newer therapeutics specifically target proteins involved in
cellular signaling [1,2]. However, these therapies are not
always effective [3], and the reason for failure, whether
inherent poor interaction or complex cellular response, is
unknown. In order to understand the development of disease and drug resistance in these cases, the recovery of the
process that led to the specific cellular malfunction must
be identified. Such errors generally involve the cellular signaling networks that control cell growth, differentiation,
apoptosis, and motility [4,5]. Because of the extreme
underlying biological complexity of these pathways, diseases that involve errors in signaling processes arise from
a myriad of different cellular malfunctions, for example in
cancers [6,7] and diabetes [8,9]. It is from this complex
background that functional genomics attempts to glean
insight to improve our understanding of diseases.
One of the major uses of microarrays has been elucidation
of gene expression in cancer, often focused on refining
cancer identification using computational and statistical
approaches [10-12]. In addition, the discovery of biomarkers in the form of differential levels of production of
mRNA has been a focus in a number of studies [13-15].
The fact that determination of the mRNA levels of a single
gene is easier than using an entire array has driven the
shift to the use of arrays to generate potential biomarkers,
so that the expression levels of these individual genes can
be screened for in a more economical way (see, for example, [16]). For diabetes, microarrays have been used to
elucidate gene expression in both type I and type II diseases, and customized chips targeting genes of interest
have been developed [17].
Many tools for statistical inference, pattern recognition,
and data mining have been developed for microarray data
analysis. Statistical tests include SAM [18], VERAandSAM
[19], ANOVA techniques [20,21], Bayesian approaches
[22,23], and rank tests [24]. Pattern recognition and data
mining techniques comprise both unsupervised techniques, such as hierarchical clustering [25], singular value
decomposition [26], multidimensional scaling [27],
Bayesian mixture models [28,29], and other clustering
methods [30-34], and supervised techniques, such as support vector machines [35] and artificial neural networks
[36], (for a review see [37]).
While these techniques are useful, they have certain limitations as regards more advanced uses in the elucidation
of mechanisms operating in diseased tissues. New therapeutics specifically target proteins involved in cellular signaling [1-3,38-40]. As noted above, these therapies are
not always effective, and a method to understand the reason for their ineffectiveness is highly desirable. If the fail-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/99

ure modes for the targeted therapeutics are understood,
new therapeutics can be designed or combination therapies undertaken. In addition, to design new therapies that
work alone or in combination with other therapies, an
understanding of signaling networks is required. Microarray measurements can provide insight into these issues.
Unfortunately, the recovery of pathway information from
transcriptional data requires complex analysis, since signaling protein activity is not generally linked to the mRNA
expression levels of genes encoding the signaling proteins
themselves [41], nor are protein levels tightly coupled to
transcript levels even in yeast [42,43]. This makes it
impossible to directly link an increase in mRNA expression of the gene encoding a signaling protein, such as the
therapeutic target, with activity of the protein and therefore of the signaling pathway. Instead, an analysis must
treat changes in mRNA levels as downstream indicators of
activity.
An important issue to resolve in order to correctly interpret patterns in microarray data is the underlying dimensionality of the data, since statistical analysis of genes in
groups relies on correct separation. The dimensionality
provides an estimate of the number of patterns required to
explain the variation in the data not related to noise,
which is equivalent to the number of basis vectors
required mathematically to describe the data or the
number of principal components required to span the
data.
We present here a new application of Bayesian Decomposition [44-48] and ClutrFree [49] that estimates dimensionality by measuring the consistency of assignment of
genes to patterns. With this approach, transcriptional signatures are linked to signaling activities through gene
ontology [50] using the MIPS database [51] and through
analysis of transcription factor activity [52]. We demonstrate this technique on the Rosetta deletion mutant dataset [53], which is a compendium of genome-wide
transcription measured for 6300 genes across 300 conditions (mostly deletion mutants, but some chemical treatments). Figure 1 details the workflow of our analysis.
Previous studies of the compendium were performed
using hierarchical clustering [53], non-negative matrix
factorization [54], and Bayesian Decomposition [44]. The
dimensionality of the data was estimated in various ways
in these studies leading to estimates from 7 to 50 dimensions.

Results
Dimensionality of the data
We propose a value for the Rosetta dataset dimensionality
based on the average persistence calculations at each tree
level made with ClutrFree using multiple Bayesian

Each mutant (a column of the P matrix) can belong to
multiple patterns, which models the fact that each mutant
will have many cellular functions active. Each gene (a row
of the A matrix) can be assigned to multiple patterns,
reflecting the fact that evolution has led to genes being
involved in multiple cellular processes. Interpretation of
the results involves identifying cellular processes from the
genes that are significantly expressed in a pattern (i.e.,
within a column of A).

The average persistence across all dimensions
The average persistence across all dimensions. The
average persistence across the dimensions is plotted for 3 to
25 dimensions. The significant drop between 15 and 16
dimensions suggests that 15 patterns provides the correct
dimensionality for analysis.

Decomposition simulations. The dimensionality has been
inferred from the average persistence defined in the Methods section. As the number of basis vectors (i.e., patterns)
k is increased, the curve shows a dramatic drop for k > 15
(see Figure 2). This drop is due to the reorganization of
the groups of mutants constituting the basis vectors for k
> 15 patterns, leading to an overly low average persistence.
The freedom to move between branches leads also to
some loss of consistency in the annotations as one moves
down a branch. This contrasts with the behavior of basis
vectors obtained for less than 15 patterns where biological
functions split logically as the number of patterns
increases. We also observed a reduction in the number of
genes related to each basis vector for 16 patterns in comparison to 15. Also, the standard deviation across samples
of the obtained vectors is significantly higher for 16 patterns (1.7 Ã 10-3) than for 15 patterns (7.9 Ã l0-4) indicating that the Markov chain sampling is not as tightly
constrained by the probability distribution. The behavior
observed occurs because of the potential to overfit the
data with 16 basis vectors allowing the algorithm to find
multiple configurations to explain the variation in the
data.
Identifying patterns and functions
Bayesian Decomposition retrieves the two linked matrices: the P matrix (pattern matrix) groups mutants that
share cellular functions, which can be deduced from the
genes linked to each pattern contained in the A matrix.

We proceed by using the dimensionality estimate of 15
patterns and exploring for each pattern the genes associated with that pattern. These genes are interpreted using
the MIPS ontology for yeast [51] in order to predict the
cellular processes associated with a pattern. In addition,
for patterns that can be linked to signaling pathways, we
discuss the use of data on genes regulated by specific transcription factors and validate the results by analysis of specific key deletion mutants. For each pattern that shows
enhancement of ontological terms we provide the terms,
the enhancement (as defined in the methods section),
and the p value for a hypergeometric test on the term.
We summarize the results in terms of patterns previously
identified in other studies using this data set, then we
present the new results isolating signatures for activity of
the mating and filametation pathways.
Patterns identified in previous studies
Examination of pattern 1 shows expression of the overall
common minimal processes necessary for survival, with
386 annotated genes associated with this pattern at a 3Ï
level. Measure of enhancement, e, of cellular functions,
reveals two highly represented functional groups: 1)
groups related to protein synthesis and 2) groups related
to DNA synthesis. Group 1 includes genes enhanced in
Protein Targeting, Sorting and Translocation (Term 14.04,
e = 1.84, p = 0.0022), Protein Synthesis (Term 12, e = 1.55,
p = 0.024), and Ribosome Biogenesis (Term 12.01, e =
1.60, p = 0.059). Group 2 includes DNA Processing (Term
10.01, e = 1.32, p = 0.097), DNA Recombination and
DNA Repair (Term 10.01.05, e = 1.31, p = 0.16), and DNA
Synthesis (Term 10.01.03, e = 1.58, p = 0.16). The p-values
for the ontology terms remain high, due to the large
number of genes associated with this pattern.

This pattern, which essentially includes genes necessary
for viability, contains all the mutants of the dataset,
although the Ssn6â mutant shows a lower level for this
pattern than other mutants. As the Ssn6â mutant exhibits
substantially greater overall expression than any other
mutant (including the Tup1â mutant with the second
highest level), this may reflect the high association of the
Ssn6â mutant seen in almost all patterns, which will have
some gene overlap with this pattern.

The strongly linked MAPK signaling pathways for mating and
filamentation are shown schematically with black arrows indicating mating pathway signaling and gray arrows showing filamentation pathway signaling. The mating pathway is initiated
by binding to Ste2p or Ste3p receptors, while the causative
molecular trigger for filamentation is unclear. The pathways
share many components.

Pattern 5 contains 172 annotated genes. Highly enhanced
ontologies include transport-related functions: Transported Compounds (Term 20.01, e = 2.02, p < 10-4), Ccompound and Carbohydrate Transport (Term 20.01.03,
e = 2.60, p < 3 Ã 10-4), and Cellular Transport, Transport
Facilitation and Cellular Routes (Term 20, e = 1.62, p < 6
Ã 10-4), in addition to other transport terms at p < 10-3.
The pattern contains the two deletion mutants, Ssn6â and
Tup1â, and represents the strong response seen in the
original study [53]. Ssn6p and Tup1p form a system of
transcriptional repression that appears to be highly conserved in eukaryotes [55]. In yeast, the complex acts as a
global transcriptional repressor over a large number of
genes (more that 150), coordinating several cellular systems, including haploid specific genes, glucose repressible
genes, and oxygen utilization genes [56]. Turning off this
repression leads to a large overall increase in gene expression (the overall expression in these two mutants is many
fold higher than in other mutants).

Pattern 7 is related to the lack of cell wall functions (Cell
Wall, Term 42.01, e = 0.0), as 28 cell wall genes (of 32
total) are absent from this pattern, while the other four
genes have multiple annotations suggesting they have
roles unrelated to Cell Wall function. Enhancement is
present for Protein Modification (Term 14.07, e = 4.7, p <
10-4) and Fermentation (Term 02.16, e = 4.5, p < 0.01).
This pattern contains the mutants Gas1â and Fks1â,
which impair cell-wall synthesis, as well as the mutant
YER083câ, annotated as disrupting the cell wall in the
original study [53]. The pattern contains other mutants
disrupting ergosterol biosynthesis as well, including
Erg2â, She4â, as well as YER044câ. In addition, the pattern includes yeast treated with the drugs that are known
to disrupt the cell wall, such as Tunicamycin and Glucosamine.
Pattern 11 is related to ribosomal function, with enhancements in terms for Ribosome Biogenesis (Term 12.01, e =
6.32, p < 4 Ã 10-4) and Protein Synthesis (Term 12, e =
3,89, p < 6 Ã 10-3). The pattern contains 8 mutants related
to ribosomal proteins, Rpll2aâ, Rpl27aâ, Rpl34aâ,
Rpl6bâ, Rp18aâ, Rps24aâ, Rps24aâ (haploid), and
Rps27bâ, as well as some mutants with deleted ORFs of
unknown function, YOR078wâ, YMR269wâ, and
YHR034câ, proposed to be involved in ribosomal functions [53].
Patterns related to cellular signalling pathways
The two patterns that represent new insights into this data
are 13 and 15, which appear related to two strongly coupled developmental pathways in yeast. Previous studies
[44,53] have identified the mating pathway transcriptional response, however this has included both the filamentation response and the mating response. It is difficult
to separate these signatures, as the mating and filamentation pathways share many common elements in a MAPK
cascade as shown in Figure 3[57-59].

Gene ontology (GO) was used to determine the biological
function described by each pattern, with a term added
specifically for transposable elements, as these are known
to play a role during filamentation [60,61]. The terms that
showed enhancement are summarized in Table 1. The
patterns show strong overlap, since many genes are shared
between the mating and filamentation responses. However, the filamentation ontology term is significantly
higher only in pattern 15, which also shows a strong signature of transposable element genes. Meanwhile, the GO
terms for meiosis and morphogenesis (such as for budding in S. cerevisiae) are significantly enhanced only in
pattern 13. This allows association of pattern 13 with activation of the mating pathway, and pattern 15 with activation of the filamentation pathway.

In addition, we analyzed the 10 genes whose expression is
most strongly linked to each pattern. These are shown in
Table 2, which summarizes which genes are known to be
regulated by the transcriptional activators related to the
mating (Ste12p) and filamentation (Ste12p-Tec1p complex) pathways. The results show that the top 10 genes
related to pattern 13 have 9 genes of known function, with
8 related to the mating response, of which five are known
to be regulated by Ste12p. For pattern 15, 7 of the top 10
genes are known to be transposable element genes, with
three other genes having unknown functions. This again
links pattern 13 to mating and pattern 15 to filamentation.

activation of Ste11p directly. For pattern 15, the response
is very similar. The signal is near zero for the deletion
mutants Ste2â, Ste11â, Ste7â, and Ste12â. The Fus3â
mutant shows a signal for pattern 15, as appropriate,
while the Fus3â, Kss1â double deletion mutant does not.
In addition, the Tec1â mutant shows no signal for pattern
15, indicating that Tec1p is required for filamentation
[61]. Finally, the signal is greatly reduced for the Ste20â
deletion mutant in pattern 15 relative to pattern 13, which
agrees with previous work suggesting that the filamentation pathway is more dependent on Ste20p signaling than
is the mating pathway [62].

Discussion
In order to validate that the patterns were actually measuring activity of the mating and filamentation pathways,
we explored deletion mutants related to these pathways
[61,62]. The mating response in S. cerevisiae is mediated
via a MAPK signaling cascade initiated by binding to the
Ste2p or Ste3p membrane receptors (Figure 3). The signal
is transduced through Ste11p, Ste7p, and Fus3p with
Ste5p serving as a scaffolding protein. The signal activates
the Ste12p transcription factor, leading to transcription of
mating response genes. In addition, the signal is transduced to the MAPK cascade from the membrane receptor
by a G protein complex or through the Ste20p protein.
Pattern 13 shows near zero signal for the deletion mutants
Ste11â, Ste7â Fus3â, Ste12â, Ste5â, and Ste2â, while
showing signal for deletion mutants of Ste20â and Tec1â.
This is exactly as expected, with the membrane receptor,
all signaling proteins in the cascade, and the transcription
factor necessary to generate the transcriptional response
related to the mating signal (note that the Ste3â mutant is
not in the data set). Ste20p is not necessary to raise the
mating response, since the G-protein complex can trigger

Microarrays and GeneChipsâ¢ have become the tools of
choice for the investigation of genome-wide transcription
in most biological systems. The resulting data comprises
noisy estimates of transcription levels for roughly 6,000
genes in yeast to more than 20,000 genes in typical mammalian studies. Numerous statistical and data mining
methods have been applied to this data in order to identify individual genes showing differential expression, to
identify patterns related to physiological states, and to
identify groups of genes comprising biological processes.
These studies generally have not focused on the estimation of cellular signaling from the data, despite the prevalence of cellular signaling in many diseases.
As noted in the introduction, the recovery of signaling
pathway information from transcription data requires
complex analysis, since protein levels do not correlate
well with mRNA levels and signaling protein activity is
not generally linked to the mRNA expression levels of
genes encoding the signaling proteins themselves. As
such, changes in mRNA levels are limited to being a

downstream indicator of activity. If a complete model for
the transcription of genes, including all known transcriptional regulators and biological processes regulating transcription, was available, the inference of activity would be
straightforward. Unfortunately, the network models and
even gene annotations are still far from being complete. In
addition, the growing evidence supporting the important
role of non-coding RNAs in regulation of gene expression
(including antisense transcripts and micro-RNAs, see for
example [63-65]) further undermines the potential of
using mRNA species as markers for proteins and their
activities [66].

in previous studies, the global transcriptional repressor
complex Ssn6-Tupl has been isolated in a single group. In
addition, patterns for cell-wall synthesis, ribosomal function, and the global functions necessary for continued viability of yeast were isolated. In contrast to previous
analyses of this data, two pathways related to the MAPK
cascade were isolated, one related to mating and the other
to filamentation. Once the correct dimensionality was
determined, Bayesian Decomposition was able to identify
transcriptional signatures unique for each pathway. The
assignment was validated by an investigation of the deletion mutants known to adversely affect these pathways.

In order to overcome this incompleteness, we have created the method described here. We couple identification
of transcriptional signatures with our Bayesian Decomposition algorithm to a consistency analysis for gene assignment to patterns determined by comparison of different
dimensionalities using ClutrFree. This allows the identification of the correct dimensionality to be applied to subsequent ontology and transcription factor analyses.
ClutrFree is also used to determine the ontological terms
enhanced within each pattern and to obtain a list of genes
tied to this pattern, which can then be linked to specific
transcription factors. In this way, the biological processes
associated with conditions can be identified, and inferences can be made on the activity of specific transcription
factors. This then allows inference on the activity of signaling pathways, which cannot be obtained with methods
previously applied to microarray data. Overall, the
method requires many separate steps, each modeling an
aspect of the biological system, in order to make proper
inferences on signaling from the data.

Conclusion
Microarray studies have been widespread in biological
and medical research, often focusing on identification of
genes significantly correlated with various disease states.
However, many diseases arise from disruptions in cellular
signaling, and in these cases gene expression only provides a downstream indicator of signaling activity. This
greatly complicates the analysis. The new approach introduced here recovered signatures allowing us to make validated inferences on strongly overlapping signaling
pathways.
The results demonstrate that for Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
the mating and filamentation pathways can be distinguished from transcriptional signatures determined from
analysis of microarray data, despite the intrinsic high
noise, confounding transcriptional activity, and tightly
coupled nature of the pathways. The next step will be to
apply these methods to more complex signaling networks
in worms, flies, and mammals.

In the application to the Compendium data presented
here, our analysis was able to extract the common features
for a set of mutants that eliminated related pathways. As

Methods
The Rosetta deletion mutant data set
The Rosetta Compendium comprises 300 conditions,
including 276 deletion mutants, 11 tetracycline regulated
genes, and 13 drug treatments, in S. cerevisiae growing in
rich medium [53]. The data were generated from a two
color cDNA microarray hybridization assay [67], and
transcriptional profiles were measured both with technical replication and biological replication (151 mutants).
In parallel with the 300 experiments, 63 controls of wildtype S. cerevisiae were grown in identical conditions and
compared against each other, permitting creation of a
gene-specific error model. The data was downloaded from
Rosetta Inpharmatics.
Data preprocessing
The data was filtered to retain only conditions characterized by at least a variation of 3 fold in a minimum of 2
genes. Then all genes that did not vary by 3-fold in at least
2 conditions were also removed, leading to a data matrix
comprising 764 genes and 228 conditions.

The data used by Bayesian Decomposition included both
the mean log ratio for each data point and the uncertainty
in this measurement determined by the Rosetta error
model. Since Bayesian Decomposition as applied here
requires positivity [45], the log ratios were converted to
ratios and the uncertainties propagated to uncertainties
on the ratios. Although analysis of residuals suggested
that seven dimensions fit the data [44], the analysis presented here suggests that this is due to overestimation of
uncertainty in the data. Bayesian Decomposition is not
highly sensitive to minor misestimations of noise however, so that this should not be a problem for this analysis.
Analysis with Bayesian Decomposition
Bayesian Decomposition (BD) has been applied to multiple types of data: in vivo spectroscopic data [68], medical
imaging [69], microarray data from single cell organisms
[44,45], mammalian model organisms [47], humans
[70], and on phylogenomic sequence data [71]. A detailed
description of the algorithm [46] and a review of applications [48] have been published.

Briefly, BD models the microarray data, comprising a
matrix of estimates of the ratio of expression between the
experimental condition and a control, as the result of the
multiplication of two matrices describing behaviors
across conditions (the P or pattern matrix) and the distribution of genes within those behaviors (the A or amplitude matrix). Naturally, the data, D, includes noise, so
that the full relationship is defined by

Dij â

K

â Aik Pkj + Îµ ij

[1]

k =1

where Dij is the estimated ratio for gene i in mutant j, Aik
is the strength of gene i in pattern k, Pkj is the strength of
mutant j in pattern k, and Îµij is the noise for gene i in
mutant j estimated by the Rosetta error model. BD estimates A and P by a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
simulation. For the fixed noise estimate, Îµ, A and P are
inferred from the marginal probability distribution
p (D | A,P) p (A,P)

[2]

where p(A,P) is the prior probability and p (D | A,P) is
given by the likelihood such that

The prior is used here to require positivity and to minimize structure in the estimates of A and P [46].
The analysis with BD is similar mathematically to an analysis with singular value decomposition (SVD) or with
principal component analysis (PCA), since all methods
estimate two matrices that together reconstruct the data.
In both PCA and SVD, orthogonality conditions force
each row of P to be linearly independent, deriving P from
either the data matrix (SVD) or the covariance matrix
(PCA) using deterministic algorithms. Since patterns of
expression related to biological processes will not generally be independent, BD uses the MCMC approach to
avoid orthogonality. The resulting rows of P are usually
easier to relate to biological processes than those from
SVD or PCA.
BD was run at each posited dimensionality, K (as in equation 1), between 3 and 25, generating a mean estimate
and an uncertainty (i.e., standard deviation from samples
of the posterior probability distribution) for each element
of A and P. The dimensionality is equivalent to the
number of patterns, as the patterns can be viewed as nonorthogonal basis vectors for D.
Persistence and dimensionality
The results of Bayesian Decomposition across the different estimated dimensionalities, K, were compared with
ClutrFree in order to visualize stable basis vectors and a
persistence measurement on them [49]. Each independent BD analysis provides a tree level, with each pattern
represented by a node (see Figure 4). The analysis with the
fewest patterns is placed at the top of the tree, and additional levels of analyses are added creating a tree from

Figure 4
Relationship of patterns across dimensionalities
Relationship of patterns across dimensionalities. The results for all patterns identified in all runs of Bayesian Decomposition are summarized here. The top row shows three patterns from an analysis with 3 dimensions, while the bottom row
shows 25 dimensions. The highlighted node is pattern 13 in 15 dimensions, which is the pattern identified as the mating
response. Nodes are connected as described in the text using Pearson correlation measures. The numbers within the nodes
are indices and have no intrinsic meaning. Each number provides the row index for P and column index for A for the analysis
at that level.

fewer to larger numbers of patterns. Connections in the
tree are created in a greedy way. Level N+1 (e.g., 4) is connected to level N (e.g., 3) by finding the node in level N+1
with the highest correlation to a node in level N. The correlation is given by the Pearson correlation for the
strength of the assignment of mutants to a pattern (i.e.,
between Pkj for the nodes). These nodes are connected and
removed. From the remaining nodes, the maximum correlation between a node at level N+1 and one at N is
found again, and this process is repeated until only a single node remains at level N+1. This node is then connected to the node at level N that yields the highest
correlation.
Following our previous work [49], we use a measure of
persistence to quantify the robustness of a pattern across
the variation of the number of patterns. An example calculation is shown in Figure 5. The assignment of a mutant
to a pattern (i.e., a node) is binarized based on the mean

and uncertainty of the assignment of the mutant to the
pattern determined by the MCMC sampling, using a
requirement that the mutant be assigned to the pattern at
greater than 3Ï above zero. In Figure 5, it is assumed there
are four mutants in a pattern, thus there are four binarized
values. Then at each node, each mutant is compared for
consistency in presence of the mutant in linked nodes
within the tree. For example, for the highlighted node in
Figure 5, the first mutant is present in the node above and
the node below, so it is present in all 3 connected nodes.
For the second mutant it is present in 2, and the third and
fourth mutants are absent. The average persistence for the
node is therefore (3+2+0+0)/4 = 1.25 as noted in Figure 5.
For branches, the mutant status is only required to agree
in a single branch to be counted. The average persistence
at a dimension is then the average of the persistence for all
nodes at that dimension (i.e., a row in Figure 4).

Figure 5
A sample calculation of the average persistence for a single node
A sample calculation of the average persistence for a single node. The average persistence is calculated by comparing
the persistence at each node in the tree given in Figure 4. Each assignment of each mutant (4 are shown here) to a pattern is
binarized as described in the text, then the average persistence for a node is calculated by checking on the number of times the
mutant assigned to the pattern occurs in the connected nodes. The mutant can occur in any branch below the node of interest
to be considered as present. If it occurs in multiple child nodes at a single level, that is still treated as a single occurrence for
that level. The average for a dimension is then the average of the persistence of all nodes at that level.

We assessed the dimensionality of the data using measurements of persistence. The persistence was measured for
analyses from 3 â 25 patterns and the dimension chosen
where a significant drop occurred in an otherwise slow
monotonic decline, which was expected due to the
branching nature of the tree. Figure 2 shows the significant drop between 15 and 16 dimensions, so 15 patterns
were chosen for further analysis.
Ontology and function
To assign ontological terms to the genes contained in
basis vectors, we annotated our data using the gene ontologies from the Comprehensive Yeast Genome Database
(CYGD) hosted at the Munich Information center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) [51,72]. The analysis here utilizes
the Functional Catalog (FunCat) format that describes
each gene using a hierarchical ontological model.

Similar to persistence, we defined enhancement as a
measure of the over-representation, or under representation, of a gene function in a subset of the data [47]. It is
the ratio of the frequency of occurrence of genes annotated by a particular ontological term in the pattern to the
frequency of occurrence of the same term in the whole
dataset,

e(t , p) =

g p / np
G/N

,

[4]

with gp being the number of genes annotated with the
term t in pattern p, np the total number of genes in the pat-

tern p, G the number of genes annotated by the term t in
the data, and N being the total number of genes in the
dataset. In addition, we apply a hypergeometric test to
estimate a p-value for each term. Function was then determined by inspection of enhanced ontological terms.
Transcription factor analysis
The genes were also analyzed for the patterns determined
to be related to signaling pathways by exploration of the
ten genes most strongly associated with the pattern. Each
gene was analyzed using the Saccharomyces Genome
Database [73] to determine whether it was known to be
associated with mating or filamentation processes and to
determine if it was directly regulated by the Ste12p transcription factor.

Authors' contributions
GB performed analysis with BD and ClutrFree, including
identification of biological processes from gene ontology
measurements. KS and JMC provided advice and guidance
on development of ClutrFree for these analyses. MFO
oversaw the project and did gene ontology and transcription factor analysis on patterns 13 and 15.
