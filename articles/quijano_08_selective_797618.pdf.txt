<p>Genes occurring in conserved, tandemly-arrayed clusters in Drosophila melanogaster are co-expressed to a much higher extent than
Gene duplicationgenes.</p>

Abstract
Background: The physical organization and chromosomal localization of genes within genomes is
known to play an important role in their function. Most genes arise by duplication and move along
the genome by random shuffling of DNA segments. Higher order structuring of the genome occurs
in eukaryotes, where groups of physically linked genes are co-expressed. However, the
contribution of gene duplication to gene order has not been analyzed in detail, as it is believed that
co-expression due to recent duplicates would obscure other domains of co-expression.
Results: We have catalogued ordered duplicated genes in Drosophila melanogaster, and found that
one in five of all genes is organized as tandem arrays. Furthermore, among arrays that have been
spatially conserved over longer periods than would be expected on the basis of random shuffling,
a disproportionate number contain genes encoding developmental regulators. Using in situ gene
expression data for more than half of the Drosophila genome, we find that genes in these conserved
clusters are co-expressed to a much higher extent than other duplicated genes.
Conclusions: These results reveal the existence of functional constraints in insects that retain
copies of genes encoding developmental and regulatory proteins as neighbors, allowing their coexpression. This co-expression may be the result of shared cis-regulatory elements or a shared
need for a specific chromatin structure. Our results highlight the association between genome
architecture and the gene regulatory networks involved in the construction of the body plan.

Background

The simple idea that the functionality of eukaryotic genomes
is determined solely by the content of genes and their regula-

tory regions has been gradually replaced by a more complex
view, which recognizes a crucial role for the way in which
these functional elements are distributed and organized. The

discovery that some groups of genes with particular organizations (normally neighboring genes) have been conserved over
long periods confirms that, at least in some cases, proximity
between genes is essential for their functionality. The fruitfly
Drosophila melanogaster contains several examples of
duplicated genes arranged in such a fashion and that are
involved in embryonic patterning; these include the en-inv
[1], ey-toy [2] and eyg-toe [3] pairs, the achaete-scute [4],
Enhancer-of-split [5] and iroquois clusters [6], and most significantly the Antennapedia and Bithorax Hox complexes [7],
whose genomic organization has been conserved since the
appearance of metazoans. The identification of substantial
overlap in the expression patterns between genes within these
groups suggests that these arrangements might be first fixed
and subsequently maintained by the need for certain shared
regulatory regions.
Beyond these specific examples, a number of large-scale computational studies have attempted to detect and measure the
level of gene organization within eukaryotic genomes. These
analyses searched for significant correlation between gene
order and co-expression, under the assumption that neighboring genes will be expressed in a concerted way (for a
review, see [8]). However, the results of these studies, normally consisting of rather weak correlation signals, are insufficient to provide an understanding of the overall gene
organization in eukaryotic genomes. This is the case not only
when comparing gene order with co-expression, but also
when comparing groups of genes belonging to different functional classes or involved in the same process or pathway [911]. In contrast to prokaryotes, where functionally related and
co-expressed neighboring genes (mostly arranged in operons) are abundant and easily identified, eukaryotic genomes
present an apparently much more complex organization, in
which genes with no obviously ordered distribution predominate and co-exist with a smaller class of clustered, coexpressed genes. An important limitation of previous analyses is that, because of their global nature, they were unable to
identify which genes require a particular genomic arrangement for their function and are, therefore, directly responsible for the detected correlation signal. Furthermore, many
large-scale studies have deliberately not considered duplicated genes in order to exclude a disproportionate co-expression signal due to recently duplicated genes [12-14], despite
the fact that most co-expressed neighboring genes in eukaryotes appear to have arisen by gene duplication. In fact, the
identification of these clusters of duplicated genes underlines
the importance of gene organization in eukaryotic genomes
[8], and provides important information about how genes
evolve after their duplication.
Here, we have combined computational and experimental
approaches to identify and characterize all detectable duplicated genes that have been conserved in close proximity in the
Drosophila genome. Through analysis of available in situ
expression data we have also evaluated the expression pattern

of the detected cases in order to determine their level of coexpression. We found that a number of duplicated genes have
been retained as tandems over a longer period than would be
expected in the absence of selective constraints, and that this
gene set is enriched in genes involved in developmental processes as well as those encoding transcriptional regulators.
Furthermore, we show that these ancient tandem duplicates
show a higher level of co-expression than other genes, even
recently duplicated tandem pairs.

Results and discussion
Identification and organization of duplicated genes in
Drosophila
As a first step towards the identification and characterization
of duplicated genes conserved in proximity, we evaluated how
duplicated gene pairs are generally distributed along the fly
genome. For this, we first identified duplicated gene pairs
(paralogues) by comparing Drosophila protein products (see
Materials and methods) and then evaluated the distance separating the duplicate genes on the same chromosome
(expressed as the number of 'intervening non-paralogous
genes': i-genes). This analysis showed that a predominant
fraction of paralogous genes have zero or few intervening
genes. The number of paralogous pairs decreases exponentially thereafter as the number of intervening genes increases
(Additional data file 1). This distribution probably reflects the
abundance of recently duplicated gene copies, which are still
arranged as they were formed, that is, in tandem.

Genes originated by tandem duplication separate with
time in a non-linear fashion
If we take as our null hypothesis that duplicated gene pairs
will gradually separate over time as the result of random
genome reorganization events, such as inversions and translocations [15], we can predict that the physical distance, or the
number of i-genes, separating duplicate genes that originated
in tandem should gradually increase with time. And indeed,
this general tendency is observed when we compare the
number of i-genes and the relative age (inferred from the
degree of neutral sequence divergence, dS) for each duplicated gene pair; the number of gene copies separated by many
i-genes (>100) appears to be higher for older duplicated pairs,
indicating that most duplicated genes are not under selection
pressure to remain in proximity and can separate over time
(not shown). However, the physical separation between the
copies does not appear to be gradual, because we do not
observe a linear correlation between genetic distance and age,
but rather an all-or-nothing phenomenon, whereby duplicate
genes are either co-localized or are dispersed at distant locations in the genome (Figure 1a). By comparing the exonintron structures of duplicated pairs, we further discarded
possible biases and ruled out that this pattern could be due to
a massive presence of retrogenes in Drosophila [16] (see
Materials and methods). This pattern of gene separation,
which implies profound remodeling of the genome, is consist-

sequentially with time, as estimated by dS values. The majority of gene
pairs are either very near or far apart. The most frequent profiles for
duplicated genes are (but not restricted to) consecutive (i-genes
approximately 0) or recently (dS approximately 0) duplicated genes or
both. Only pairs separated by up to 100 intervening genes and with dS < 5
are shown. (b) The proportion of pairs of duplicated genes that have
separated increases over time, reaching a point where more than 90% of
all duplicated genes are not physically linked. For example, there are 240
linked pairs in the dS 0-0.5 range, while there are only 19 for dS 4.5-5.0.

ent with the extreme degree of chromosomal rearrangement
found in Drosophila [17-19], rather than with a predominance of micro-inversions and small insertions, which would
move and shuffle genes gradually within chromosomes.

A high degree of gene duplication and arrangement of
duplicate genes in tandem arrays is found in the
Drosophila genome
To distinguish tandem from dispersed duplicates, we needed
to determine at what level of sequence divergence (that is, at
which relative age) we can expect any two duplicated genes to
have separated from each other. To answer this, we first classified all detectable gene copies into two groups: tandemly
arrayed duplicated genes (TDGs) and dispersed duplicates.
TDGs were conservatively defined as those separated by 10 igenes or fewer, based on a statistical comparison of the actual
distribution of duplicated gene pairs with 10,000 distributions of randomly arranged pairs (Additional data file 2).
Using these parameters, we found that of the 8,664 genes

Volume 9, Issue 12, Article R176

Quijano et al. R176.3

detected as duplicates in D. melanogaster (59% of all genes),
2,952 are organized in tandem, in agreement with previous
estimates [11]. This represents one in three (34%) of all duplicated genes, and one in five (20%) of the whole gene set, a figure only slightly higher than that observed in mammals and
plants [20,21]. When we explored how duplicated genes tend
to separate with time, we found that the proportion of gene
duplicates that are dispersed increases linearly with the level
of neutral sequence divergence, that is, with time. This relationship reached a maximum (roughly between dS values of 3
and 4), beyond which it appears that practically all duplicated
pairs that can freely separate from each other have done so
and remain apart (Figure 1b). These data follow an exponential distribution that reaches a plateau at 92.51% (p-value <
0.05, when compared to a distribution assymptoting at
100%), from which we can conclude that there is a fraction of
duplicated genes that do not separate over time. The same
behavior was observed using, instead of dS, dN (number of
non-synonymous substitutions per site) as an estimator of the
relative age of the duplicates, which is expected to be more
inaccurate than dS, as it depends on levels of purifying selection and these, on gene function (data not shown). This observation suggests that some of those gene pairs that show high
levels of sequence divergence and still remain as neighbors
could have been retained in tandem due to selective constraints. On the other hand, this behavior could also simply
reflect a passive and neutral retention of duplicates in tandem
over long time periods. As a way to distinguish between both
possibilities, we examined if there is any functional difference
in this set of genes that could derive from a selective retention
of certain classes of tandem duplicates.

Evolutionarily conserved tandem duplicates are
significantly enriched for developmental and
regulatory genes
Gene Ontology (GO) analysis [22] reveals that the set of TDGs
with a high degree of sequence divergence (2,012 genes with
dS > 4), likely representing 'old' linked genes, is significantly
enriched in genes encoding functions related to embryonic
development and transcriptional regulation when compared
to dispersed duplicated genes (Additional data file 3). This
association was not observed with younger gene duplicates
(1,523 genes with dS < 4), and even more, a high number of
these functions were observed among the under-represented
GO terms for TDGs with dS values between 0 and 2. This finding suggests that developmental and regulatory genes are
overrepresented among conserved linked gene copies, and
that the known examples previously described [1-7] are not
just anecdotal and known because of a biased sampling from
the literature.
However, the use of dS values beyond saturation (dS > 2 or 3)
should still be treated with great caution, despite being used
at large scale and to detect a general behavior of genes. For
this reason, we next used an alternative approach to accurately classify and select a collection of 'old' gene duplicates,

and re-evaluate them at the level of potential functional
enrichments. To do so, we obtained a collection of gene duplicates through a phylogenetic approach, searching for TDGs
that we are certain have been conserved as such during the
independent evolution of fly and mosquito since their divergence at least 250 million years ago [23]. This new set,
although limited in size, is expected to be more reliable and to
avoid the potential problems associated with the calculation
of the neutral divergence (dS) of 'old' duplicates [24]. To
obtain this new collection of conserved neighboring gene
duplicates, we first applied the same procedure described
above to identify and classify duplicate genes in the genome
of the mosquito Anopheles gambiae. Compared to the 2,952
TDGs identified in D. melanogaster, we found 2,637 in mosquito. We then compared the TDG sets from D. melanogaster
and A. gambiae and defined TDGs as evolutionarily conserved using orthologous duplicated genes that are arranged
in tandem in both species and that fit a phylogenetic model
consistent with the existence of the TDG group in a common
ancestor (see Materials and methods). In this way, we defined
the set of conserved TDGs, comprising 400 genes, grouped in
154 tandem arrays (the majority of which contained 2 or 3
duplicate genes; see Materials and methods). Consistent with
our previous analysis (Figure 1b), more than 95% of these
TDGs conserved between A. gambiae and D. melanogaster
have gene duplicates with dS values > 2. This confirms that
we are in fact dealing with a collection of gene duplicates with
ranges of ages where nearly all duplicates are expected to be
separated.
In order to further confirm that this set truly represents TDGs
conserved throughout the dipteran lineage, we additionally
checked for their presence in two other drosophilid genomes,
D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis, which have divergence times
from D. melanogaster of 27 and 40 million years ago, respectively. A minimum quality of genome assembly is crucial for a
correct estimation of TDGs, and prohibited the inclusion in
our analysis of other non-dipteran insect species with fragmentary genome assemblies [25,26]. We found that out of the
154 TDG arrays conserved between D. melanogaster and A.
gambiae, 131 (85.1%) are also present in D. pseudoobscura
and 122 (79.2%) in D. virilis. To determine whether or not
this degree of conservation with other drosophilids can be
explained by random processes of retention or loss of tandem
duplicates, we analyzed the organization of 526 pairs of tandemly duplicated genes from D. melanogaster that are not
conserved with A. gambiae in the genome of D. pseudoobscura. In order to ensure that the absence of conservation in
this comparison is due to a separation or loss of duplicates in
D. pseudoobscura and not to D. melanogaster-specific duplications, we did not count TDGs for which we could find only
one or no orthologues in D. pseudoobscura or D. virilis. This
gave us a group of 398 TDGs, of which 305 (76.6%) are conserved in D. pseudoobscura, showing that those TDGs that
have been formed before the split of A. gambiae and D. melanogaster and have been conserved together since then have

a higher probability to be also in tandem in a different drosophila than those TDGs of more recent evolutionary origin
(two-tailed Fisher's exact test; p-value < 0.05).
Of the conserved tandem arrays between fly and mosquito,
33% (132 genes) are included in syntenic regions where gene
order is conserved between D. melanogaster and A. gambiae
[27]. This figure coincides with the overall percentage of D.
melanogaster-A. gambiae orthologues remaining in synteny
[25], showing that the conserved TDGs cannot, therefore, be
explained by synteny alone.
We compared the GO distributions of TDGs and dispersed
duplicates, and of conserved TDGs versus dispersed duplicates and non-conserved TDGs. We did not find significant
differences in the distribution of functional categories
between TDGs and dispersed duplicates (Additional data file
4). However, as with the constrained TDG set defined by neutral divergence criteria, the conserved TDG set is enriched in
developmental and transcription factor genes in comparison
with both the dispersed duplicates (21 out of 30 overrepresented GO terms with p-value < 0.05) and the non-conserved
TDGs (30 out of 49 overrepresented GO terms with p-value <
0.05 (Additional data file 5)). To confirm that this trend held
for all genes categorized as developmental or transcriptional
regulators, we compared the abundance of genes annotated
with four higher-level GO terms in each duplicate gene set relative to their abundance in the whole collection of duplicated
genes (Figure 2; Additional data file 6). As expected, the relative abundance of genes annotated with 'catalytic activity'
[GO:0003824] and 'metabolic process' [GO:0008152] was
similar among all sets. In contrast, genes in the 'multicellular
organismal developmental' [GO:0007275] and 'transcriptional regulator activity' [GO:0030528] categories were notably more abundant in the conserved TDG set. We observed
these same trends when we removed from the conserved TDG
set those genes that are located in syntenic regions (see above;
data not shown). This further shows that the functional
enrichment observed is not due to a fraction of TDGs being
maintained as such because of evolutionary conservation of
larger regions of the chromosome with conserved gene order.
To validate this observation, we repeated the analysis using,
instead of GO categories, gene sets defined independently by
Nelson and co-workers for another purpose [28]. These gene
sets are 'complex' (genes with high regulatory complexity),
'HK' (house-keeping) and CDY (single genes in C. elegans, D.
melanogaster and yeast). In this case, we observed a relative
enrichment of 'complex' genes in the conserved TDG set
(Additional data files 6 and 7). We can therefore affirm that
certain classes of duplicated gene, mostly 'trans-dev' (developmental transcriptional factor) genes [29], are preferentially
retained over evolutionary time in a tandem organization
after duplication. Thus, the conservation of TDGs requires an
explanation involving evolutionary forces that favor certain

encompasses the expression, by whole mount in situ hybridization, of nearly half the genome [32]. While these data are
certainly scarcer than expression profiles based on DNA
microarrays, they are much more information-rich, and thus
a valuable complement to other studies [33]. For those gene
clusters for which in situ patterns were available, two or more
genes that share a characteristic expression domain in the
embryo were scored as positive for co-expression. Maternal
or ubiquitous expression was not considered as evidence for
co-expression (see Materials and methods). In total, we
scored the expression of 1,963 genes (Table 1).

functions of the duplicated genes, and not the neutral drift of
genome re-ordering.

Evolutionarily conserved tandem duplicates are highly
co-expressed
Considering our previous results, the conservation of tandem
duplicates could be explained by the existence of shared cisregulatory elements, making their separation deleterious for
the organism and, therefore, less probable or impossible to fix
in the population [30,31]. A prediction of this scenario is that
conserved TDGs would be more likely to be co-expressed in
time and space than other duplicate pairs. To test this hypothesis, we examined the database of gene expression patterns
during embryogenesis in D. melanogaster, which to date

Of the 154 evolutionarily conserved TDG clusters, in situ
hybridization evidence was available for 52, and of these, 19
showed co-expression (36.6%; Additional data file 8). We also
examined expression data for 179 dispersed duplicate gene
pairs for which clear orthologues exist for both genes in A.
gambiae. Of these groups, co-expression was found for 38
(21.3%). This analysis thus shows that tandemly arrayed
duplicated genes that have been conserved in proximity since
the divergence of D. melanogaster and A. gambiae are more
likely to share a characteristic expression pattern in the early
embryo than other duplicated genes (Chi squared; p-value <
0.05).
We next assessed whether co-expression was simply an effect
of both genes being in the same genomic location [11,34]. Of
198 groups of genes examined that are not related by duplication but are linked in both D. melanogaster and A. gambiae
(conserved neighbors), we found evidence of co-expression
for 37, or 18.7% (Additional data file 9). Comparison with the
figure of 36.6% for the evolutionarily conserved TDG clusters
demonstrates that co-expression of conserved TDGs cannot
be explained by being located in broader co-expression
domains of the genome (Chi squared; p-value = 0.01). We are
aware that this analysis is limited by the number of cases
examined (Additional data file 10) and also by the fact that we
can only use positive evidence, since two genes that are not
co-expressed in the embryo may be so at later stages. We nevertheless have confidence in the results because of restrictive
criteria use in the analysis, which would tend to underestimate the number of co-expressed conserved TDGs.

The set of evolutionarily conserved TDGs that are coexpressed includes many previously identified cases (Additional data file 11), such as en and inv [1], tin and bap [35], gsb
and gsb-n [36], srp and GATAe [37], the odd-drm-sob zincfinger cluster [38], and wg and Wnt4 [39]. However, a
number of previously unreported cases of co-expression were
also identified (Figure 3). Among these are four members of
the Osiris gene family, which are expressed in common
domains in the esophagus and the thoracic epidermis (Figure
3). These genes encode proteins of unknown function whose
conservation with orthologues in Anopheles has been previously reported [40]. We also identified a pair of genes that
encode previously undescribed proteins characterized by collagen-like triple helix repeats, and which are expressed at the
early blastoderm stage in a highly restricted domain in the
anterior pro-cephalic region (Figure 3). Another interesting
example is that of the Snail family zinc-finger gene scrt and
its duplicate pair CG12605 (Figure 3). Both genes are specifically expressed in the central nervous system, including the
cephalic anlagen. scrt is considered to be a pan-neural marker
in Drosophila development; however, its mutation produces
only a subtle eye phenotype [41]. The fact that a closely
related gene lies in its vicinity may indicate that the full function of scrt and CG12605 in neural development will not be
revealed unless both genes are mutated (or deleted) simultaneously. Given the high number of tandem duplicates we have
shown to be present in the Drosophila genome, this situation
may be more frequent than previously thought, and might
explain many cases of mutants that do not show the phenotype predicted on the basis of the wild-type gene's expression
pattern.

Conclusion

Our study provides evidence for the existence of evolutionary
constraints that determine the relative positions of a large
fraction of duplicated genes in the Drosophila genome; moreover our results show that this phenomenon is related to gene
functionality. We have shown that duplicated pairs are
extremely abundant, and that these pairs separate over evolutionary time according to an all-or-nothing pattern, which
indicates that genome remodeling in Drosophila does not
proceed by gradual separation. Despite the general trend for
neutral gene shuffling, we found that duplicated pairs that are
preferentially retained as neighbors are enriched in genes
involved in developmental processes and the regulation of
transcription. We further show that these conserved duplicated genes tend to be co-expressed in the early fly embryo,
which suggests the existence of shared cis-acting regulatory
regions that act as a selective brake to keep these gene copies
in proximity.
This does not imply, however, that duplicated copies will
remain fully redundant over time. It is not difficult to envision
subsequent processes of neofunctionalization or subfunctionalization occurring between copies, which would result in

Volume 9, Issue 12, Article R176

Quijano et al. R176.6

clusters of two or more genes with partially overlapping
expression domains and functions and at the same time specific and unique roles. This occurs with the Hox clusters,
which are a clear example of conserved TDGs.
Nevertheless, it is unlikely that shared cis-regulation is the
only mechanism acting to keep duplicates together, and it certainly does not exclude other constraints, such as chromatin
structure, which may also play a role in the evolution of gene
order.
Finally, the duplicated genes catalogued here will be of great
value for the Drosophila community, since many of them may
be involved in key developmental processes, and their characterization might help to uncover functions that are not apparent from simple forward genetics approaches, which overlook
potential redundant roles of duplicated copies.

Detection and classification of gene duplicates
We characterized the duplicate gene content of the D. melanogaster and A. gambiae genomes by following a series of
simple steps. We first obtained the protein sets for each species from the April 2007 release of the Ensembl genome
server [42] and, for those genes with multiple transcripts, filtered out shorter isoforms, retaining only the largest protein
sequence for each gene. Second, we performed an intra-species comparison of all protein sequences using BLASTp [43],
default options. In cases with several high scoring pairs
(HSPs) per query, we obtained a single sum scored E-value
for each matching protein pair by applying Karlin and Altschul statistics [44], which we also explain here. We have
defined co-ordered HPSs by what we call 'best HSP tracking',
which takes the best HSPs that are consistent with the coordinates of the immediately previous HSP, when they are
ordered by E-value, starting with the most significant HSP.
The E-value for one HSP is calculated with this statistic:
E-value = kmne-λS
where S is the score, m and n are the size of the query and the
database size, respectively, lambda is a matrix specific constant to normalize the score and k is an adjusting constant of
minor importance in the analysis. All the values can be captured from the BLAST output file. The sum score is calculated
as:
r

S sum = λ

∑S

r

− ln(kmn ) − (r − 1)(ln(k ) + 2 ln( g) − log(r !)

i =1

where m and n are the size of the query and the subject
sequences, respectively, and g the gap size. The corresponding p-value then is:

Conserved
Conserved TDGs show co-expression in the Drosophila embryo. The figure shows in situ hybridization data for TDGs whose expression has not
been previously described. Four genes from the Osiris cluster are expressed in the esophagus and in the ventral ectoderm, while three genes encoding
Elongation-of-very-long-fatty-acids synthases (ELOVL) are expressed in the large intestine. We also found two undescribed genes that encode proteins
with collagen-like repeats that are both expressed in a discrete domain at the anterior end of the syncitial blastoderm stage embryo, and two Ras-family
members that show expression in the procephalon and ventral ectoderm. We have also found that the scrt Snail-type zinc finger gene has a conserved
linked duplicate and both are expressed in overlapping domains in the central nervous system.

of two genes in tandem was considered sufficient to be scored

which can be corrected for multiple testing with:
p-value(corr) = p-value/β(r-1) (1-β)
to finally obtain the corrected E-value (beta is the gap decay
and 0.1 by default):
E-value(corr) = (effective_db_lengtth/n)p-value(corr)
Third, a gene pair was finally accepted as duplicated when
their detected relation passed one of these two conditions: an
E-value lower than 10-20; or the relation between identity and
alignable sequence length passed the criteria described by
Bukhard Rost [45] to exclude false positive relationships with
no biological meaning (distance to Burkhard Rost > 0; see as
follows). When the alignment length is lower than 300 amino
acids the distance from a multiple HSP BLAST alignment to
Burkhard Rost's homology estimation is:
dist = percent_identity - 10 480alignment_length(-0.32(1+exp(-alignment_length/1000)))
and for larger alignments we approximated the distance as:
dist = percent_identity - 30
TDGs were defined as duplicated genes separated by no more
than ten non-related intervening genes, which provides a
conservative value for significant linkage (Additional data file
2). Each chromosome arm was treated independently. An
array of two or more consecutively linked genes meeting this
criterion was defined as a TDG cluster or group. This step
generated 1,001 groups in Drosophila and 899 in Anopheles,
of which the vast majority are only composed of two or three
genes (838 and 740, respectively, more than 80% in both
cases; Additional data file 1).
To identify TDG clusters phylogenetically conserved between
Anopheles and Drosophila, we first performed an all-versusall BLASTp comparison of a joint collection of sequences containing all Drosophila and Anopheles proteins. We then
ranked all the sequence relationships between each TDG cluster in Drosophila and each TDG cluster in Anopheles by their
corresponding E-value. Conserved TDG clusters were defined
as those for which more than 50% of all the possible interspecies relationships have lower E-values than intra-species hits.
This filter ensured that practically all the Drosophila clusters
identified as conserved have an ancient origin and thus
avoided the inclusion of fly-specific duplicates. The conservation of TDG clusters with D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis was
manually inspected by examining the genomic location of
one-to-one orthologues with D. melanogaster on the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser [46].

Because retrotransposed gene copies could potentially have
an impact on our analysis and conclusions, we wanted to evaluate their relative abundance within our set of gene duplicates. A recently published work identifies only 94 retrogenes
in the fly genome [16], a fraction that appears to be negligible
if we consider all 8,664 duplicated genes used in this study.
Nevertheless, to rule out without doubt that the contribution
of retrogenes to our analysis is not relevant, we compared
gene structures between duplicates in order to detect all possible episodes of retrotransposition within our set of duplicates. In total, we found 566 cases that could be compatible
with a retrotranspositional origin (that is, that have no
introns and a multiexonic paralog). To minimize the interference of possible insertions or deletions of introns in one of the
copies with time, we repeated these comparisons by only considering 271 recent duplicates (dS < 0.1) and found that only
approximately 10% of the cases (25 in total) are consistent
with a retrotranspositional origin. This indicates that the contribution of retrotransposition in the appearance of gene
duplicates in fly is marginal. Furthermore, and in agreement
with this finding, we evaluated the distribution of the percentage of retrogenes (using this extremely relaxed definition)
within our set using bins of 0.1 dS and observed that the percentage of retrogenes within our set of duplicates is always
lower than 10% and normally between 5% and 6%. All the different sets of gene used in this study can be found in Additional data file 12.

Calculation of dS values
We calculated the rate of synonymous substitutions (dS)
between two particular gene copies by first extracting the
alignment derived from the best-scoring HSPs obtained from
their BLASTp comparison. Each of these alignments was then
used as a template to obtain a codon-based DNA alignment
(using their cDNA sequences and the pal2nal program [47]).
Finally, dS values were calculated from the DNA alignments
by maximum likelihood analysis using the codeml program
included in the PAML package for phylogenetic analysis [48]
(runmode = -2, seqtype = 1, and CodonFreq = F3 × 4).
In order to monitor potential issues derived from the saturation of high dS values, we also repeated all the analyses using
dN values as a rough estimate of the relative age of duplicates.
These dN values were extracted from the same alignments
and the same PAML settings that yielded dS values.
The data for Figure 1b were fitted to an exponential one-phase
association model using the GraphPad Prism© package (La
Jolla, California, USA), setting a Y0 value of 0 (to account for
the fact that we are examining duplicates originated in tandem, and that by definition these will all be linked at time =
0). In these conditions, the 95% confidence interval for the

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R176

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/12/R176

Genome Biology 2008,

plateau (asymptote) value was between 86.78% and 98.23%.
When compared to a model with a hypothetical plateau value
of 100%, the model where the distribution does not asymptote at 100% is statistically significant (p-value = 0.0242). If
we use all of the available data for higher dS values (dS 0-7, or
dS 0-10) we find that the distribution reaches a plateau at
89.89% of dispersed duplicates, with even higher significance
compared to the hypothesis of asymptoting at 100% (p-value
< 0.0001). Similar conclusions are reached if instead we
divide the distribution in a two-phase linear model (not
shown).

Random test of gene ordering
To distinguish tandem from dispersed duplicates we needed
to define the maximum distance (in i-genes) between two
duplicated genes for which the linkage was significant when
compared with a random distribution along the genome. For
this, we modeled 10,000 random replicates of the Drosophila
genome by shuffling all genes within the same chromosome
arm while retaining their similarity values calculated as
described above. We then calculated the probability of finding
a particular separation in i-genes between two gene copies by
chance by counting the frequency of such distances in all random models generated and dividing by the number of replicas
(n = 10,000; Additional data file 2). To discard the influence
of recently formed gene copies, which will mostly be in tandem (that is, at 0 i-genes) we also included, in addition to the
test considering all duplicated genes, another test considering
divergent gene copies only (taken here conservatively as copies with dS > 4).

Gene Ontology analysis
The distributions of functions associated with the different
subsets of gene duplicates were evaluated by analysis of GO
terms [22] using the Fatigo tool from the Babelomics data
analysis suite [49]. This tool provides an adjusted p-value
based on family wise error rate and false discovery rate methods in order to correct for multiple tests [49]. Four high-level
GO terms were selected for further examination. For a given
subset of duplicate genes, the proportion of genes in each GO
category was calculated by dividing the number of genes
annotated with that category by the total number of genes in
the subset. Values were normalized by dividing them by the
proportion of genes annotated with that GO term in the complete set of duplicated genes (Additional data file 6). A value
of 1 would indicate that the distribution of the GO term in
question was the same in the given subset as in the complete
set of duplicated genes. To compare the relative distributions
of GO terms in the gene sets derived from Nelson et al. [28],
values were normalized to the proportion of genes annotated
with each GO term in the whole genome. This is because, by
definition, the CDY set (single genes in C. elegans, Drosophila and yeast) is significantly underrepresented in the
complete duplicated gene set.

In situ analysis and scoring
For comparison of in situ hybridization staining patterns,
duplicated genes were first categorized into the following subsets. (a) Conserved TDGs (see above). (b) Non-conserved
TDGs. (c) Conserved non TDGs, defined as those dispersed
duplicates in Drosophila (that is, separated by > 10 i-genes)
for which each gene has a 1:1 orthologue in Anopheles (as
defined in the Ensembl database). This subset includes duplicated genes that, like conserved TDGs, were formed before
the separation of Drosophila and Anopheles lineages (and are
thus of comparable ages); however, in this case, the duplicates have separated at least in the Drosophila lineage. (d)
Conserved neighbors, which include genes not related by
duplication that are located in regions of synteny between D.
melanogaster and A. gambiae (obtained from the supplemental data to the honeybee genome analysis [27]) and that
had 1:1 orthologues in A. gambiae (obtained as above). All
TDGs were removed from this subset.
For each category, we identified those gene groups for which
at least two genes had been tested for embryonic expression
by whole mount in situ hybridization (Table 1). The expression data for all genes in a given group were visually inspected
and compared. A gene group was scored as positive if at least
two genes showed expression in a common domain or subdomain of the embryo. Other groups were scored as not
informative; we deliberately did not search for negative evidence, since we cannot exclude the possibility that two genes
that are not expressed in common domains in the embryo
stages examined do so at other unexplored stages or in the
adult. Therefore, we can only score for positive evidence of coexpression. Maternal or ubiquitous expression was not used
as positive evidence for co-expression.
