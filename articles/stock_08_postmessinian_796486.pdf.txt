Abstract
Background: Little attention has been paid to the consequences of the last landbridge between Africa and Sicily
on Mediterranean biogeography. Previous paleontological and scarce molecular data suggest possible faunal
exchange later than the well-documented landbridge in the Messinian (5.3 My); however, a possible African origin
of recent terrestrial Sicilian fauna has not been thoroughly tested with molecular methods. To gain insight into
the phylogeography of the region, we examine two mitochondrial and two nuclear markers (one is a newly
adapted intron marker) in green toads (Bufo viridis subgroup) across that sea barrier, the Strait of Sicily.
Results: Extensive sampling throughout the western Mediterranean and North Africa revealed a deep sister
relationship between Sicilian (Bufo siculus n.sp.) and African green toads (B. boulengeri) on the mitochondrial and
nuclear level. Divergence times estimated under a Bayesian-coalescence framework (mtDNA control region and
16S rRNA) range from the Middle Pliocene (3.6 My) to Pleistocene (0.16 My) with an average (1.83 to 2.0 My)
around the Pliocene/Pleistocene boundary, suggesting possible land connections younger than the Messinian (5.3
My). We describe green toads from Sicily and some surrounding islands as a new endemic species (Bufo siculus).
Bufo balearicus occurs on some western Mediterranean islands (Corsica, Sardinia, Mallorca, and Menorca) and the
Apennine Peninsula, and is well differentiated on the mitochondrial and nuclear level from B. siculus as well as from
B. viridis (Laurenti), whose haplotype group reaches northeastern Italy, north of the Po River. Detection of
Calabrian B. balearicus haplotypes in northeastern Sicily suggests recent invasion. Our data agree with
paleogeographic and fossil data, which suggest long Plio-Pleistocene isolation of Sicily and episodic Pleistocene
faunal exchange across the Strait of Messina. It remains unknown whether both species (B. balearicus, B. siculus)
occur in sympatry in northern Sicily.
Conclusion: Our findings on green toads give the first combined mitochondrial and nuclear sequence evidence
for a phylogeographic connection across the Strait of Sicily in terrestrial vertebrates. These relationships may have
implications for comparative phylogeographic research on other terrestrial animals co-occurring in North Africa
and Sicily.

Background
On the phylogeographic patterns of terrestrial Sicilian
fauna
Since Busack [1,2], the faunal relationships between
North Africa and Iberia have been the focus of numerous
molecular phylogeographic studies, yet little attention has
been drawn to the consequences that the last landbridge
between Africa and Sicily may have had on Mediterranean
biogeography. As was the Strait of Gibraltar, the Strait of
Sicily (no universally accepted name in English; other
names include Sicilian Strait, Sicilian Channel, Channel
of Sicily, Pantelleria Channel) is purported to have
formed at the end of the Messinian salinity crisis (5.3
Mya), at the Miocene/Pliocene boundary [e.g. [3-6], F.
Rögl pers. comm.]. The Messinian [4] was a geological
period from 5.59 to 5.33 Mya during which the Mediterranean Sea was isolated from the Atlantic Ocean, resulting
in a large decrease in the Mediterranean Sea level and the
formation of landbridges between Africa, Europe and
most Mediterranean islands. This included a well-documented landbridge between Africa and a landmass that
later became part of Sicily, which may be the last terrestrial connection between the African mainland and the
island. However, while it is known that Sicily and Tunisia
are at present approximately 140 km apart, low Pleistocene sea levels of about -120 m [7-9] would have repeatedly drawn the north African paleo-coast and the Sicilian
landmass closer than ~50 km (Figure 1). In addition, current shoals [10,11] may be remnants of Pleistocene "stepping stone islands" that may have facilitated terrestrial
animals, including humans [12], in overcoming the sea
barrier. Therefore, the phylogenetic depths of sister relationships between Sicily and Africa may vary as they do
for trans-Gibraltarian relationships [2,13]. Observations
of this pattern in widespread taxa might be explained by
multiple invasions across the Strait of Sicily and/or additional potential invasions from the region that now forms
the Italian (Apennine) Peninsula.

As expected for an island with a long Pliocene isolation
[14], endemic (island specific) forms in several animal
groups on Sicily have been revealed by molecular analyses
(e.g.: hedgehogs, Erinaceus [15]; shrews, Crocidura [16];
mice, Apodemus [17]; beetles, Pachydemidae [18]; terrapins, Emys [19]; skinks, Chalcides [20]). Using these methods, some of these species have been shown to be sister
taxa to populations from the Apennine Peninsula (e.g.
Apodemus, Erinaceus) or to be of very recent Apennine
peninsular (or Calabrian) origin (reviewed in [21]). This
pattern may be explained by "an intermittent filter barrier
in the area of the Strait of Messina [which] probably controlled the processes and timing of the Late Middle Pleistocene-Late Glacial vertebrate faunal dispersal in Sicily"
[Bonfiglio in: [22]]. Many Pleistocene fossil megafaunal
elements entered Sicily from peninsular Italy [Bonfiglio

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/56

in: [22]]. However, Bonfiglio [14] also hypothesized a
Lower Pleistocene African origin of fossil elephants
(Elephas falconeri) as a debatable alternative to derivation
from European/Italian E. antiquus [Bonfiglio in: [22]].
Other paleontologists have also discussed whether Sicily
had early Pleistocene connections to Africa, as in an, in
this respect, unresolved investigation of a Pleistocene
amphisbaenid lizard from Sicily [23]. All these authors
[22-24], however, refer to the lack of conclusive evidence
for a Pleistocene landbridge. Recent molecular data have
suggested phylogeographic links across the Strait of Sicily,
either based on very little data, or, with some speculation
on the dating of these divergences [[20,25]; see Discussion].
On green toads in the western Mediterranean region and
North Africa
Green toads are widespread in the Palearctic region where
they have differentiated into several lineages [26]. The
occurrence of three bisexually reproducing ploidy levels
[27] makes them a uniquely interesting vertebrate group.
A recent survey of mtDNA variation characterized a deeply
branched assemblage of at least twelve major haplotype
groups [28]. Other data on green toad variation from
North Africa have been relatively scarce [29,30]. Research
has been mainly restricted to faunistics [31-33] or analyses of single populations (Egypt [34]) without taxonomic
or phylogeographic focus. Green toad biology and ecology are relatively well known from the Balearic Islands
[35,36], Corsica [[37] incl. refs.], Sardinia and mainland
Italy [38]. In addition, morphometric analyses of green
toads in Italy have been restricted to peninsular and Sardinian (plus Corsican) populations [38,39] until morphometric data for a population from northwestern Sicily
became available [40]. Otherwise, regional research has
been restricted to classical biogeography and faunistics
including ecological and taxonomic remarks [41-43] and
studies on phenology [40,44].

To gain insight into the phylogeography of the region, we
test a wide range of possible substitution rates in order to
better date the African-Sicilian divergence of green toads:
Based on only two haplotypes from Sicily, Stöck et al. [28]
roughly calibrated their tree by "assuming that the last
landbridge between North Africa and Sicily broke about
5.3 Mya." Alternatively, this divergence could be younger.
Here, we examine genetic data from many individuals and
many more localities in Tunisia, Italy and Sicily, to scrutinize the North Africa-Sicily divergence employing a Bayesian coalescent demographic reconstruction method
(BEAST 1.4.6). Using two mitochondrial and two nuclear
sequence markers and additional morphological, phenological, bioacoustic and biogeographic data, we characterize green toads from Sicily as a separate evolutionary
lineage that is a sister taxon to African green toads, but

substantially different from other western Mediterranean
green toad forms. These phylogeographic relationships
substantiate scarce knowledge on western Mediterranean
terrestrial biogeography and may have implications for
comparative research on the phylogeography of other terrestrial animals in the region.

Results
Phylogeographic structure reveals a relationship across the
Strait of Sicily
We found genetic markers in green toads (Additional file
1) within our geographic scope (Figure 1) to indicate five
major spatially structured lineages (Figure 2). (I) The first
lineage was found on Corsica, Sardinia, the Balearic
Islands, Apennine Peninsula and the northeastern
extreme of Sicily. This clade (balearicus) was different from
other Eurasian mainland green toads (lineages II and III:
viridis and variabilis), whose ranges border northeast to the
Po River drainage and belong to widespread monophyletic groups in Eurasia [28]. (IV) Although geographically neighboring I, on most of Sicily and its surrounding
islands another lineage (Bufo n. sp.) occurs that is substantially different from the first. (V) The entire North African
range and the off-coast islands constitutes a fifth lineage
(boulengeri). The details of the results defining each lineage are described below.

In particular, our analyses shows a deep sister relationship
between African (V) and Sicilian (VI) groups and therefore a rarely studied phylogeographic connection across
the Strait of Sicily.
Characterization of the groups identified based on the
Bayesian phylogram
Here we consider and name lineages that maintain their
evolutionary integrity with respect to other lineages
through both time and space and name them as species
under the phylogenetic species concept.
Bufo balearicus Boettger, 1880
For details on taxonomy and nomenclature of Bufo balearicus [45] see supporting data in Additional file 2 (d). Analyses of mitochondrial 16S (not shown in tree) and control
region sequences of 50 green toads from the Balearic
Islands (loc. 5–7), Corsica (loc. 8–9), Sardinia (loc. 10–
12), the entire Apennine Peninsula (loc. 13–16), Apulia
(loc. 17), Calabria (loc. 18, 19), Marche (loc. 55, 56) and
northeastern Sicily (loc. 20) form one very well-supported
haplotype group (Bayesian posterior support: 100%; Figure 1, 2). Cloned tropomyosine intron alleles (Figure 2)
from four representatives each from Sardinia (loc. 10),
Calabria (loc. 18) and northeastern Sicily (loc. 20), as well
as fragments of RAG-1 in three individuals each from Corsica (loc. 9), Sardinia (loc. 10), and Calabria (loc. 18)
formed similarly highly supported clusters (Bayesian pos-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/56

terior support: 97% and 100%) and demonstrated that
nuclear and mitochondrial markers show essentially the
same signals.
The control region tree also revealed three well-supported
subclades: one comprising toads from Corsica and Sardinia which exhibit some geographic intermixing between
genetically differentiated lineages within the islands; a
second much-less structured clade including toads from
the entire Apennine Peninsula from Turin, Pavia and
Marche (loc. 13, 14, 55, 56) in the north to Apulia (loc.
17) and Calabria (loc. 19) in the far south; and a third
subclade (nested between the two others) containing
toads from the Balearic Islands. Subclade structure is evident in the average FST values between each of these subclades (Table 1): Analyses of population structure
confirmed high genetic differentiation (pairwise FST =
0.7585, p = 0.00000) between Italian mainland and
island toads (Corsica, Sardinia). Demographic analyses
performed in Fluctuate estimated a greater than ten-fold
exponential growth rate for the clade on the Apennine
Peninsula than for the mitochondrial group on Corsica
and Sardinia (767.1 > 51.7), suggesting population
expansion on the mainland. However, log-likelihood tests
did not reject a scenario of zero growth (Table 2). Growth
of the mainland population was also not significantly
supported by the mismatch distribution analysis in which
the observed distribution matched an expected distribution for an expanding population; however, the shape and
magnitude of the observed and expected distributions are
very similar, suggesting some support for expansion on
the mainland (Figure 3c). By contrast, this analysis, both
graphical and statistical, supports stable populations on
Corsica and Sardinia (Figure 3a, b). Tajima's D estimates
for all balearicus groupings were not significant, and thus
population expansion was not indicated by this test.
The Bayesian phylogenetic analysis shows B. balearicus to
be reciprocally monophyletic on the mitochondrial level,
albeit using a subsample of individuals within each
group, with respect to all other green toads; thus our data
corroborate the proposal that B. balearicus be given the
status of a separate species (see Additional file 2 for details
on nomenclature).
Bufo boulengeri Lataste, 1879 [46]
While exhibiting some internal structure, all North African control region (Figure 2) and 16S mitochondrial
sequences (Additional file 1) of toads between the Atlantic coast of Morocco (loc. 1–3) and the Nile Valley of
Egypt (loc. 37–40), including the off-coast islands of
Kerkennah (loc. 30, 31), Djerba (loc. 32) and Lampedusa
(loc. 26), form a well-supported monophyletic cluster
(posterior probability = 99%) that is a sister clade to mitochondrial sequences of toads from Sicily (loc. 21–25), but

population growth for the green toads on the African
mainland, as well as for all boulengeri considered together;
log likelihood tests rejected no growth scenarios for both
groupings (Table 2). Tajima's D calculated for the mainland group indicated some support for population expansion (-1.63869, 0.10 > p > 0.05); however, the mismatch
distribution analysis did not support a growth model.
Tropomyosine intron sequences in African samples from
Libya (loc. 36), Tunisia (loc. 29) and Lampedusa (loc. 26)
exhibit the same tree topology as the mitochondrial markers and constitute a highly supported clade (posterior
probability = 96%) that differs substantially from tropomyosine sequences from two Sicilian green toads (loc.
21). The very conserved RAG-1 marker shows two African
samples in a polytomy with Eurasian green toads, from
which both B. balearicus and two samples each from Sicily
and Lampedusa differ.
Bufo n. sp
This taxon was identified on most of Sicily (loc. 21-23a)
and two close islands (Favignana, loc. 25; Ustica, loc. 24).
Demographic analyses performed in Fluctuate estimated θ
to be an order of magnitude lower than that estimated for
all other green toad groups examined except the mainland
balearicus group (Table 2). Although the log likelihood
test did not permit rejection of a no growth scenario, the
very low initial θ estimated by the analysis indicates that
few individuals may have founded the lineage. Similarly,
the observed mismatch distribution is not statistically
identical to the expected distribution under a sudden
growth model (p = 0.077). However, the unimodal peak
is shifted to the left of the distribution and very tightly
matches the expected distribution for a recently expanded
population (Figure 3f). Finally, Tajima's D did not indicate deviation from neutrality, and thus a scenario of population expansion cannot be invoked with this measure.

Bufo n.sp. exhibits reciprocal monophyly for both mitochondrial markers (and using the tropomyosine intron
marker on a subsample of individuals) with all other
groups/taxa (Figure 2). The RAG-1 phylogram shows
toads from Sicily and Lampedusa forming a well-sup-

ported (posterior support = 100%) clade that differs from
all sampled African and Eurasian green toads (Figure 2).
For all mitochondrial and nuclear markers, Bufo n.sp.
shows a much greater genetic distance from Italian mainland B. balearicus than from B. boulengeri, which inhabits
all of North Africa. Taken together, as for the two preceding taxa, phylogenetic divergence of Bufo n. sp. is evident
and we acknowledge this by describing it as new species
(Bufo siculus, see below).
Bufo viridis (Laurenti, 1768) and old isolates
The haplotype group representing this taxon, as previously shown by Stöck et al. [28], was found exclusively in
the very northeastern part of Italy, northeast of the Po
River (loc. 41, 42). So far, two very well supported monophyletic and geographically widespread mtDNA groups of
green toads are known from the Balkan region. The haplotype group dominating Asia Minor (B. variabilis) and
that of B. viridis (Figure 1: blue and light green; [28])
apparently co-occur in Greece. However, neither of the
two was found off the Adriatic coast on the Croatian
islands of Krk and Cres (loc. 43, 44). Instead, a very well
supported separate clade (posterior support = 100%)
formed by two sequences of toads from those islands
revealed an apparent relict group, which is more closely
related to B. viridis than to B. variabilis (Figure 2), but further data are required to confirm this relationship.
Age of African-Sicilian vicariant separation
Divergence time estimates for the principal mitochondrial
(control region and 16S rRNA) clades recovered are
shown in Table 3. We provide the 95% highest posterior
density intervals (95% HPD, that is, the shortest intervals
that include 95% of the posterior sampled values) as well
as the mean of the sampled values. Time estimates are
based on the reconstruction of the most common recent
ancestor for the mtDNA control regions under the coalescent (see Material & Methods section for details). The 95%
HPD, although overlapping, show consistent values
within and between clades. Divergence between African
and Sicilian haplotypes falls within the range of 0.6 and
3.5 My [mean 1.8 My, around the Pliocene/Pleistocene
boundary (~1.8 My)] for the control region. Divergence

time estimates were also derived using the 16S data (see
Material & Methods for details). Results were similar to
those obtained using the mtDNA control region (divergence between African and Sicilian haplotypes: 95% HPD
from 0.164 to 3.603 My (mean: 2.051); split of balearicus/
viridis clades: 95% HPD from 0.18 and 3.795 (mean:
2.123). All the dates estimated in our analysis seem to represent post-Messinian divergence events.
Multivariate morphometric comparisons
A discriminant analysis using all 20 characters demonstrated the distinctness of toads from Sicily by correct
reclassification of 100% of individuals into the four
groups from: (i) Sicily, (ii) N-Africa, (iii) Corsica and Sardinia, and (iv) the Apennine Peninsula. Although
encoded as belonging to different geographic groups, the
genetically more closely-related groups (iii) and (iv) of
the B. balearicus clade showed fewer differences (Figure 4),
making us confident of the power of the analyses' and this
morphometric dataset. However, in order to test for
potential over-parameterization of the analysis, we also
reduced the number of morphometric characters to five,
which again reclassified 100% of the individuals into their
four respective groups.

Discussion
A phylogeographic relationship between Africa and Sicily
We have demonstrated a sister relationship on the mitochondrial and nuclear levels between green toads from
Sicily (B. siculus, see below) and those from the entire
North African range (B. boulengeri). The phylogenetic
depth of this divergence, which may range between 0.63
My and 3.5 My (mean 1.83 My) for the control region and

from 0.164 to 3.603 My (mean 2.051) for the 16S rRNA,
probably excludes human introduction and reveals an
infrequently-studied phylogeographic relationship in terrestrial vertebrates. This evolutionary connection may be
significant for the phylogeography of the Mediterranean
and have implications for research on other terrestrial animals. While some biogeographic studies have suggested
common ranges for terrestrial vertebrates (for example the
"Siculo-Maltese-Maghrebin" range type of Turrisi and Vaccarro [42]), and paleontologists discuss a possible early
Pleistocene faunal exchange with North Africa (see introduction), so far, very few molecular studies have suggested
any genetic relationships within terrestrial vertebrates
across the Strait of Sicily. Two examples come from species (e.g. Discoglossus [25]; Chalcides [47,20]), for which
human introduction elsewhere at circum-Mediterranean
sites has been demonstrated and for which African-Sicilian relationships have never been demonstrated using any
nuclear sequence data. Despite some recent speculation
(e.g. Crocidura sicula, potential Messinian origin from
North Africa [16]), a possible African origin of terrestrial
Sicilian fauna has rarely been thoroughly tested with
molecular methods, and never using any nuclear
sequence, and thus supported by both mitochondrial and
nuclear sequence data. To our knowledge, a genetic African-Sicilian link has only been inferred in two other terrestrial species, but even these have ambiguous
information on timing and direction: (i) Phylogenetic
inference based on allozymes regarding relationships
among Chalcides lizards from Sicily, Africa, the Apennine
Peninsula and Sardinia [47] showed Sicilian skinks most
closely related to Italian mainland skinks (Calabria in the
south to Liguria in the north), while lizards from Tunisia

appeared genetically almost identical to Sardinian Chalcides, interpreted as a human introduction from Tunisia
into Sardinia. Very recently, however, Giovannotti et al.
[20] found two Sicilian Chalcides mtDNA haplotypes to
have a sister relationship with Tunisian and Sardinian
haplotypes (the latter data not shown in the Chalcides
phylogeny) and interpreted this as a possible Lower Pleistocene (1.8 My) colonization event of Sicily (and Italy)
from North Africa. (ii) Using allozymes and cytochrome
b, Zangari et al. [25] assessed lineage relationships among
discoglossid frogs from multiple locations in the western
Mediterranean (including Sicily, Sardinia, Tunisia). These
authors showed a deep divergence of some mtDNA haplotypes across the Strait of Sicily, but also some nearly
identical haplotypes across Sicily, Tunisia and Algeria.
While the authors commented imprecisely (i.e., they did
not specify if the following referred to Gibraltar or Sicily
or both) that the "spread of Discoglossus between Europe
and Africa should have occurred at the end of the Messinian salinity crisis", they interpreted closely-related haplotypes across the Strait of Sicily as "little genetic
differentiation detected among Algerian and Tunisian D.
auritus with respect to Maltese and Sicilian D. pictus suggest [ing] a very recent isolation", without further interpreting or dating their results. The significance of land
connections for faunal exchanges between Africa and Sicily is mildly challenged by the well-known salt tolerance

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/56

of green toads. Gordon [48] experimentally demonstrated
survival of B. viridis in seawater for several hours or days.
Breeding and swimming in brackish (beach or desert)
pools and waters [49] as well as estuaries has been
observed [38]. Therefore, green toads may have the potential for transmarine dispersal. The distance from Africa to
Sicily (~140 km), however, can be considered a very
strong barrier, even during low sea levels (>45 km). In
addition, external fertilization (and absence of brood
care) requires that several adults or larvae disperse in
order to found new populations. This and the early divergence time (0.63 My < 1.83 My < 3.5 My) of African and
Sicilian lineages make it more plausible that toads with a
terrestrial life style dispersed via land connections than by
rafting. This hypothesis was supported in the recent study
of terrestrial Chalcides lizards (see above), which estimated a similar divergence between Tunisian and Sicilian
clades (1.8 My [20]) to the one we propose for green
toads. However, several papers have suggested the ability
of anurans to overcome large sea barriers [50,51], especially in the tropics, where swimming islands may facilitate rafting. Therefore, comparative phylogeographic data
from other terrestrial species in Sicily and North Africa
would be necessary to test the feasibility of competing
hypotheses.
Divergence time estimates based on molecular data normally rely on external calibration points from the fossil
record or from well-known paleogeographic events.
Because neither fossil nor paleogeographic calibration
points were available, we calculated divergence times
using an uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock and a range
of substitution rates for the two mitochondrial fragments.
We acknowledge a potential limitation, that is, the use of
only mtDNA to determine divergence times, which may
lead to overestimation of the splitting dates. This overestimation may occur because the most recent common
ancestor (MRCA) of the haplotypes (their coalescent)
does not necessarily correspond to the real temporal split
of the populations but may precede the actual divergence
of the populations [52]. We consider substitution rates
between 1% and 3% per lineage per My to be reasonable
values for amphibian mtDNA (for references see Materials
and Methods) although they have not been empirically
assessed in green toads. When regions with highly repetitive motifs are absent, as in green toads, the control region
tends to show higher rates of substitution than the rest of
the mitochondrial molecule [53,54]. Thus, the substitution rates selected here are conservative, higher than the
rate for the rest of the mitochondrial molecule, but lower
than the fastest observed rates for the control region in
other taxa. Higher rates would imply younger dates for the
splitting of the African and Sicilian lineages. This point is
illustrated by our temporal estimates from the mitochondrial 16S gene which we obtained applying a slower sub-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:56

stitution rate, which ranged from 0.03–1% per lineage per
My (see refs. in the Discussion). The two markers, with
different substitution rates, yield similar 95% HPD time
intervals.
Although the values reported should be regarded with the
caveats mentioned, it is highly improbable that the vicariant event that separated the African and Sicilian green
toads took place during the Messinian (5.3 Mya), that is,
earlier than the range of dates estimated by this method.
Instead, it is very likely that the Africa-Sicily divergence is
post-Messinian. In order to validate the hypothesis proposed here and to test competing paleobiogeographic scenarios, a formal comparative phylogeographic study
including more genetic markers and other terrestrial species in Sicily and North Africa would be necessary. Several
new comparative phylogeographic approaches have been
proposed [55-57], each requiring the inclusion of more
data for a more reliable statistical inference to be
obtained.
Historical biogeography of Bufo balearicus
The second major result of our study is that green toads
from most of the Apennine Peninsula, Corsica, Sardinia
and the Balearic Islands represent a separate taxon, which
is different from other Eurasian green toads on the mitochondrial and nuclear levels. Three B. balearicus subclades
emerged from our mtDNA control region data; the subclade on Corsica and Sardinia exhibited basal haplotypes
and the most substantial structure. These observations
suggest speciation of B. balearicus on these islands around
0.9 Mya to 1.8 Mya (Table 3). The earliest green toad fossils in Italy are known from the Late Miocene from the
northeast (Ravenna Province) and from the Pliocene in
the southeast (Gargano region) of the Apennine Peninsula [58]. They have also been identified from the Pleistocene of Corsica and Sardinia [59]. Corsica and Sardinia
had landbridges to (or were separated only by narrow
marine straits from) the Apennine Peninsula during several geological periods (~18 Mya; 9 Mya; 5.3 Mya [60]).
Although a narrow strait may have mostly separated Corsica/Sardinia from Tuscany [61], paleontological [62,63]
and phylogeographic data (Discoglossus [25], isopods
[64]) suggest limited early Pleistocene faunal (perhaps
oversea) exchange between these islands and the mainland.

This same signature is suggested by our data. The balearicus clade widespread on the Apennine Peninsula displayed a mismatch distribution visually, but not
statistically fitting that expected for a population that
underwent a sudden expansion (Figure 3). Similarly, the
coalescent simulation program Fluctuate estimated a
growth parameter ten times higher for the peninsular
group than for the island balearicus clade (Table 2), sug-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/56

gesting recent expansion, perhaps after its arrival on the
mainland; however, a no growth scenario could not be
rejected statistically. Tajima's D did not support a demographic expansion in either of the balearicus groups separately, or combined. The northeastern range limit of B.
balearicus appears to be the Po River drainage, which may
also be the southwestern boundary for B. viridis. Recent
mapping of green toad distributions in Italy [38], however, shows an apparently continuous range from the
northeast (probable haplotype group of B. v. viridis) to the
southwest (haplotype group of B. balearicus) across the Po
drainage. It is likely that the groups are in contact in that
area; discerning contacts and possible hybridization
dynamics represent challenging future research topics.
Indeed, the Po drainage seems to be a biogeographic border and/or contact zone between variously related taxa of
amphibians and reptiles (for overview [65]: Rana latastii/
R. italica; Hyla arborea/H. intermedia [66]; Bombina variegata/B. pachypus [67]; Rana lessonae/R. bergeri[68]) or, it is
considered a "source of genetic variability" [69].
Fossils demonstrate the presence of green toads on the
Balearic Islands from the Upper Pleistocene of Mallorca
[70], but early human introduction from Corsica was proposed as the source of green toads on these islands [35].
Our data show toads from Mallorca and Menorca to be
nested within the mitochondrial clades from the Apennine Peninsula and Corsica/Sardinia, and thus corroborate serum albumin data on toads from Mallorca and
Corsica that prove them more closely related to each other
than to green toads from Palestine, Africa, and Greece
[35]. We cannot locate the exact geographic origin of Balearic green toads with our current data; faster evolving
nuclear markers and denser sampling in regions of possible origin are required. Our data also corroborate provisional allozyme data (Lattes, A. 1997, Abstr. 3rd World
Congr. Herpetol., Prague: p. 123) that associated toads
from Corsica, Sardinia and NW-Italy (all from the B. balearicus range) with a ~0.25 Nei's distance from toads from
Vienna based on a UPGMA dendrogram (B. viridis; [71]
quoting Lattes' abstr.).
Although Calabria consisted of islands until the Pleistocene [72], episodic Upper Pleistocene faunal exchange
across the Strait of Messina is well documented by the fossil record [72]. While few amphibians crossed the Strait of
Messina [67], B. balearicus haplotypes have been detected
in northeastern Sicily (loc. 20).
Biogeography of Bufo siculus n. sp
Our phylogeographic findings agree with paleogeographic and fossil data [72], which suggest a long PlioPleistocene isolation of Sicily. After their "out of Africa"
origin, green toads apparently spread across most of Sicily, where they are well known from the Pleistocene fossil

Page 11 of 19

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:56

record [22]. So far, no phylogeographic signature of the
Pliocene subdivision of Sicily into two islands was
detected. The effective population size of mtDNA in Bufo
siculus n.sp., as inferred from θ (Fluctuate) is small (Table
2).
The distribution analysis indicated an observed distribution in the B. siculus clade that was unimodal and visually
congruent with the distribution of expected values for a
sudden population expansion, although not quite statistically significant (Figure 3f, p = 0.077). The distribution for
this clade is extremely compressed to the left, indicating
very low numbers of mismatches and low variance. This
profile may indicate an even more recent expansion in
this group than in the mainland B. balearicus group. The
Fluctuate analysis also did not statistically permit rejection
of a no-growth scenario for this clade, and Tajima's D did
not fit the expectation for an expanded population.
However, the high similarity among mtDNA haplotypes
across the entire island is consistent with the known high
mobility of green toads, exemplified by fast post-Pleistocene re-colonization of northern Europe by two haplotype groups [28]. The current range of B. siculus appears to
follow a pattern known in another Sicilian endemic, the
lizard Podarcis wagleriana, that is widespread across Sicily
but absent in the very northeast [42,73].

siculus exhibits strong variability in coloration with adult

Our data reveal taxonomic identity (B. siculus) of toads on
Favignana Island (loc. 25) and Ustica Island (loc. 24);
green toads on the Aeolian Islands may be members of the
geographically proximate B. balearicus (see Additional file
3 for further comments on Circum-Sicilian islands).
Detection of Calabrian B. balearicus haplotypes in northeastern Sicily (loc. 20) suggests their relatively recent invasion; either during Pleistocene sea level lows [72], by
rafting across the narrow Strait of Messina, or possibly by
human introduction. It remains unknown whether both
taxa (B. balearicus and B. siculus) occur in sympatry in
northern Sicily as range maps suggest [42], and whether
they would hybridize, given the considerable mtDNA and
breeding-phenology differences. Bioacoustic data in the
potential contact zone will also help to illuminate this
question.
Description of a new species
Mitochondrial and nuclear, morphometric and other preliminary biological data show that green toads from most
of Sicily represent a separate lineage. Sicilian green toads
have been physically separated by the Strait of Sicily from
their closest African relatives for long evolutionary periods. In order to acknowledge these facts, and to raise the
potential conservation status of this form, which represents an island endemic, we hereby describe it as a new
species.

males showing less contrast in marbled patterns than
females. Brownish to olive (but barely bright greenish)
spots often form light dorsal stripes (not to be confused
with a yellowish pigmented stripe), a character rarely
found in other green toads of Italy, but which is quite
common in B. boulengeri from North Africa. The new species is distinguishable from its geographic neighbor,B. balearicus (as defined by mtDNA haplotype group, Figure 1,
2), which exhibits pinhead-sized red (female B. balearicus)
or brownish (male B. balearicus) spots around tips of lateral glands, by the lack of these spots. Bufo siculus almost
never shows a reddish-orange coloration, characteristic of
many B. balearicus, the only form of the subgroup with
which it may co-occur on Sicily. In Sicily, the ratio VDT/
ED [vertical diameter of the tympanum (VDT) divided by
the diameter of the eye (ED)] is smaller in B. siculus [0.530
(max) ≥ 0.381 (mean) ≤ 0.247 (min) (N = 42)] than in
allo- or parapatric B. balearicus [0.622 ≥ 0.478 ≤ 0.345 (N
= 31)], but similar to that of African B. boulengeri [0.527 ≥
0.362 ≤ 0.25 (N = 29)]. In life, B. siculus has a dark yellowish-golden iris.
Variation
The morphometric variation of topotypic B. siculus with a
focus on sexual dimorphism has been recently studied by
Lo Valvo & Giacalone [40] in 354 males and 312 females.
In other parts of its range, stronger variability in size
occurs.
Karyotype
Diploid, 2n = 22 chromosomes; a mitotic metaphase is
shown in Figure 5b.
Advertisement calls
An advertisement call from the type locality (Figure 6,
recorded as described [75] at 16°C) shows a green toad
trill (similar to B. viridis; reminiscent of a canary trill) consisting of a series of up to 75 actively pulsed notes with a
constant duration separated by constant internote intervals (Figure 6b, c). Single notes show a symmetrical
amplitude increase and decrease as typical of actively
pulsed calls in Palearctic green toads. Note series are interrupted by ("inter-call") intervals of more than 12 s (at
16°C, Figure 6a). Sonagram and oscillogram (Figure 6)
reveal deviations in pulse structure at the beginning of the
call, with increasing frequency and signal intensity, as is
typical of the subgroup [75]. The fundamental frequency
of the advertisement call, from the topotypic male shown
in Figure 6, was 1600 Hz. The advertisement calls are similar in their note repetition rate ("pulse rate") to and typical of other diploid members of this complex [75,76] but
deserve further investigation with higher sample size
across a range of temperatures.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/56

Distribution
Figure 1 and this paper.
Breeding phenology
Breeding phenology may be explained by phylogenetic
history. Lo Valvo & Giacalone [74], and Sicilia et al. [44]
reported differences between Italian mainland (including
Calabrian, i.e.B. balearicus) and Sicilian green toads: B. siculus exhibits a much longer, potentially bimodal breeding
period (January-June and September-November), and
high plasticity similar to African B. boulengeri (scarce data
discussed in [44]), versus a short reproductive period in
spring (February-April) that is typical of B. balearicus.

Conclusion
Our findings on green toads give the first combined mitochondrial and nuclear sequence evidence for a phylogeographic connection in terrestrial vertebrates across the
Strait of Sicily. Given the available literature on substitution rates of the anuran d-loop and 16S rRNA, which
range conservatively from 1% to 3% to higher rates
[53,77] and from 0.3% to 1% [78,79], respectively, we
argue that the African-Sicilian divergence of green toads
may be younger (but not older) than estimated by the
present analyses. This points towards a post-Messinian (<
5.3 My) faunal exchange between Africa and Sicily. This
relationship may have implications for comparative phylogeographic research on other terrestrial animals that cooccur in North Africa and Sicily. We highlight the necessity for similar phylogeographic studies that use more
molecular markers to provide accurate estimates of the
potential vicariant events and barriers, as well as the precise dating of the splits between the lineages involved.

Methods
Sequencing of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA
Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen or ethanol preserved blood, liver, muscle tissue, tail tips (tadpoles) and
muscle of vouchers from scientific collections using the
Qiagen DNeasy™ kit. We either amplified most of the
mitochondrial control region (or "d-loop", ~860 bps
[28]) or a shorter fragment (577 bps) of the control region
using the primer pairs CytbA-L/ControlK-H (PCR: 95°C,
3 min, denaturation; cycle [94°C, 45 s, denaturation;
55°C, 45 s, annealing; 72°C, 60 s, extension] 35 times;
72°C, 5 min, final extension [28]).

In those individuals from which we sampled the shorter
control region fragment, an additional 611 bps of mitochondrial 16S rRNA were amplified using the primer pairs
16Sar-L/16Sbr-H (PCR: 95°C, 3 min, denaturation; cycle
[94°C, 45 s, denaturation; 55°C, 45 s, annealing; 72°C,
60 s, extension] 35 times; 72°C, 5 min, final extension
[80]).

1600 Hz and two harmonic vibrations are visible.

In representatives from all major mitochondrial clades,
we sequenced two nuclear markers. To amplify a fragment
of ~880 bps of RAG-1 (recombination activating gene),
we used the primers MartFL1 and AmpR1 [81] in a touch
down PCR (95°C, 4 min, denaturation; first cycle [95°C,
30s; decreasing annealing temperature from 60°C to
45°C of -1°C per cycle, 30 s; 72°C, 1:30 min] 15 times;
followed by a second cycle [95°C, 30s; 45°C, 30 s; 72°C,
1:00 min] 20 times; 72°C, 10 min). We also applied primers developed by Friesen et al. [82] for birds to amplify an
intron of alpha-tropomyosine, situated between the exons
5 and 6, for the first time (to our knowledge) to anuran
amphibians. PCR conditions for Friesen's primers proposed for "frogs" were adapted as follows: 95°C, 1:30
min; cycle [94°C, 30 s; 55.9°, 30 s; 72°C, 45 s] 30 times;
72°C, 5 min. All PCR products were sequenced directly
and apparent heterozygote genotypes of tropomyosine
were also cloned using the pGEM®-T vector system
(Promega). PCR product concentrations were quantified
(NanoDrop® ND-1000 spectrometer) and adjusted to 25
ng/µl. We mixed 1.5 µl template, 0.075 µl of vector (50
ng/µl), 2.5 µl 2× ligation buffer, 0.5 µl T4 ligase, and
0.425 µl water and ligated overnight (10°C). Transformations (2.5 µl ligation plus 12–25 µl competent cells) were
recovered in SOC for 1 h 30 min; 80–100 µl of cell sus-

pension was applied to small agar plates. After incubation
(18 h, 37°C), at least eight white colonies were amplified
with vector primers M13forw./M13rev. Nested vector
primers T7 and Sp6 (Promega) were used as sequencing
primers.
All PCR-products and clones were sequenced in both
directions and visualized on an ABI 3730 sequencer.
Sequences were aligned using Sequencher, v. 4.1.2 and
edited using MacClade 4.06.
Phylogenetic analyses
For each sequence fragment, the best fitting model of
sequence evolution was selected using MrModeltest [83].
Phylogeny was inferred for each locus separately, using
the program MrBayes (v. 3.0b4 [84]), running four chains
for 5 or 10 million generations, with tree sampling every
1000 generations. The "burnin"-value was selected by visualizing the log likelihoods associated with the posterior
distribution of trees in the program Tracer. All trees generated before the log likelihood curve flattened out were discarded. From the two different control region fragments,
we assembled an overlapping alignment of sequences
comprising 541 characters from all 148 individuals
included in this study; the best fitting model of evolution

Page 14 of 19

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:56

was HKY+G (AIC; 10 M generations; burnin = 1500, the
same settings were used for the 16S rRNA sequences). For
RAG-1 fragments (860 bp, model: GTR+G; AIC, burnin =
1000) and the alpha-tropomyosine intron (612 bp;
model: HKY+G; AIC; because of the occurrence of insertions and deletions, all missing and ambiguous data were
excluded and only 405 bp were analyzed; 5 M generations; burnin = 1000).
Because amplification or alignment of markers was not
equally possible for identical outgroup taxa from the
available material, more than one species had to serve as
outgroup. In previous analyses [[28] and unpublished
data], we demonstrated that all used taxa (Bufo surdus, B.
raddei, B. calamita, B. bufo) represent suitable outgroup
species.
Taxonomic subdivision
To evaluate the distinctiveness of genetic groups of WestMediterranean green toads of the B. viridis subgroup
[sensu [28]], and of further geographic subdivisions
within each genetic group, we calculated pairwise FST values between all groups using Arlequin 2.0 [85] based on
the mitochondrial control region.
Demographic analyses and divergence time estimates
We assessed the possibility of population expansion for
green toad groupings assembled into different geographical populations. We applied three different tests, each
with different strengths, to the mitochondrial control
region dataset (846 or 541 bp), to detect evidence of
recent expansion. First, we applied Fluctuate [86], a maximum-likelihood estimator of the parameters θ and g (θ =
2Ne/µ; g = exponential population growth rate parameter). The exponential growth parameter (g) was used to
estimate the size of the population at time in the past from
Nt = θe-(gµ)t where Nt is the effective population size at time
t in the past [86]. Using this equation, t was estimated by
substituting Nt with Nt/Nt = 0 = 0.1 (µ is DNA substitution
rate per site per generation, Nt is the female effective population size at time t). Repeated analyses to ensure stability of estimates were run as described by Stöck et al. [28].
Growth was inferred using logarithmic likelihood ratio
tests with one degree of freedom [87].

Second, DnaSP version 4.0 [88] was used to calculate and
show in graphic form the distributions of observed and
expected pairwise nucleotide site differences, also called
mismatch distributions, between all individuals within
each group, and the respective expected values for growing populations [89]. The model of sudden expansion
describes an initial population at equilibrium, with the
expected pairwise differences, θ0, (θ = 2Neµ) and assumes
rapid population growth, resulting in θ1 (Theta final).
Tau, τ, is the time of the growth measured in units of sub-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/56

stitutional time (τ = 2µt; t is the time in generations, µ the
substitution rate per locus and per generation [89]).
Graphically, the mismatch distribution of a recently
expanded population is unimodal and smooth; the waveshaped curve is centered nearer the y-axis the more recent
the expansion, moving away as the number of mismatches increases [89]. By letting θ1 become very large, θ0
and τ are estimated from the data [90]. We set θ1 to
1,000,000. We assessed the deviation of the observed distribution from the expected under a model of sudden
expansion by comparing the raggedness statistics of the
observed distribution with a simulated distribution to
determine the probability that the raggedness of the
observed distribution could have arisen by chance. Third,
we estimated Tajima's D [91] in DnaSP for each grouping.
Tajima's test of selective neutrality compares two θ estimators and its significance is evaluated by comparison of the
test statistic (D) with values randomly generated under
"neutrality." Significant values indicate the population
has deviated from neutrality, or that another demographic
force has caused the deviation from expectation, such as
population expansion (significant negative D).
Divergence times among the main mitochondrial lineages
were estimated using a Bayesian-coalescence approach, as
implemented in BEAST 1.4.6 [92-95]. In analysis of the
control region, we used a matrix of 60 individuals and 752
bp. We started the search with an UPGMA tree, constraining the clade B. boulengeri-B. siculus from Sicily to be
monophyletic. Because we were analyzing a species-level
phylogeny, we used a Yule tree prior, which assumes a
constant speciation rate per lineage. We applied an uncorrelated relaxed molecular clock, with the substitution rate
of the branch lengths being sampled from a prior normal
distribution with a mean value of 0.02 and a standard
deviation of 0.007 [94]. The search was conducted for a
range of substitution rates that varied from 1% to 3% per
million years. We ran four independent analyses for 20 ×
106generations. We checked for convergence and stationarity of the different analyses in Tracer 1.4 and combined
the results in the BEAST module LogCombiner 1.4.4 (after
removing the first 2 × 106 generations from each analysis
as "burnin").
In analysis of the 16S rRNA, we modified the search strategy to overcome the slow rate of convergence and stationarity of the MCMC chains. We analyzed a matrix of 80
individuals and 512 bp. We first constructed a UPGMA
tree with maximum likelihood distances (model selected
in Mr.ModelTest v.2: TrN + I), which was specified as the
starting tree in Beast. Previous studies have used values of
0.33% for the 16S rRNA or 0.7% more generally for a variety of different regions of the mitochondrial genome [e.g.,
[78,79]]. We specified the prior for the mean substitution
rate as a normal distribution, with a mean of 0.008 and

standard deviation of 0.003. This normal distribution
thus covered the relevant range from 0.3% to 1% substitutions per site per My. We conducted two independent runs
of 100 × 106 generations and combined the results with
LogCombiner 1.4.4, after discarding the first 50 × 106 generations from the two runs as burnin. Results were
checked using the program Tracer1.4.
Morphometric analyses
We measured most (20 out of 22) of the morphometric
traits described by Castellano and Giacoma [39]. As in
that paper, we only included male toads: 17 from North
Africa (from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt; collection
ZFMK), 21 males of the new species from Sicily and the
population means published by Castellano and Giacoma
[39] on 118 male green toads from six populations from
the Apennine Peninsula and NW-Italy [Vado L. (N = 18),
Pellice (N = 45), Isolabella (N = 13), Maremma (N = 21),
Calopezzati (N = 11), Leverano (N = 10)] and 56 male
toads from the islands of Corsica [Cirindinu (N = 18)]
and Sardinia [Barratz (N = 19), Portoscuso (N = 19)]. In
the discriminant analyses, we initially included all 20 variables. However, as this number of variables probably represents an over-parameterization of a discriminant
analysis with this number of specimens, we later reduced
this number to five variables to test for its effect. For statistical analyses, the program SPSS 11.0 for Windows was
used.
