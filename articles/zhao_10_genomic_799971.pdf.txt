Abstract
Background: Species of the bear family (Ursidae) are important organisms for research in molecular evolution,
comparative physiology and conservation biology, but relatively little genetic sequence information is available for
this group. Here we report the development and analyses of the first large scale Expressed Sequence Tag (EST)
resource for the American black bear (Ursus americanus).
Results: Comprehensive analyses of molecular functions, alternative splicing, and tissue-specific expression of
38,757 black bear EST sequences were conducted using the dog genome as a reference. We identified 18 genes,
involved in functions such as lipid catabolism, cell cycle, and vesicle-mediated transport, that are showing rapid
evolution in the bear lineage Three genes, Phospholamban (PLN), cysteine glycine-rich protein 3 (CSRP3) and
Troponin I type 3 (TNNI3), are related to heart contraction, and defects in these genes in humans lead to heart
disease. Two genes, biphenyl hydrolase-like (BPHL) and CSRP3, contain positively selected sites in bear. Global
analysis of evolution rates of hibernation-related genes in bear showed that they are largely conserved and slowly
evolving genes, rather than novel and fast-evolving genes.
Conclusion: We provide a genomic resource for an important mammalian organism and our study sheds new
light on the possible functions and evolution of bear genes.

Background
Studies of molecular evolution and the genetic basis of
physiological adaptations to extreme environments are
limited by the lack of comparative genomic resources
including non-model species. Species of the bear family
(Ursidae) are interesting and important organisms for
research in molecular evolution, comparative physiology
and conservation biology, but relatively little genetic
sequence information is available among species.
A major family in the order Carnivora, it consists of
eight extant species: giant panda, spectacled bear, and
six species within the Ursus genus (brown, polar, sloth,
sun, and Asiatic and American black bears). The phylogeny of the bear family has been intensively studied
using mitochondrial genomes [1-3], selected nuclear
gene markers [4], or fragmented nuclear DNA
sequences [5]. However currently, there are only 2,565

nucleotide sequences from the Ursidae family in the
NCBI database, mostly corresponding to mitochondrial
genes. The genome sequence of the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), a species that split off from the
Ursus bear genus about 12 million years ago (MYA) [2],
was released after the completion of this study [6]. The
availability of large-scale genomic resources for a bear
species should facilitate the study of molecular evolution
in the bear family and development of population
genetic markers to address conservation issues.
Bears are of interest for the study of the molecular
and genetic basis of mammalian hibernation. Brown
bear (U. arctos) and black bear (U. americanus) of both
sexes hibernate, and females of polar bears (U. maritimus), hibernate when pregnant [7]. Hibernation is an
energy saving adaptation that is utilized by at least
seven orders of mammals to survive in unpredictable or
seasonally extreme environments [8]. Entry into hibernation is signified by profound reduction in whole animal metabolism (to 2-25% basal rates), regulated
decreases in body temperature, heart beat and metabolic

rates that persist over hibernation seasons that can span
nearly eight months. Most hibernation studies conducted so far have focused on the hibernators of small
body sized such as ground squirrels (<1 kg) [9-12] and
marmots (<10 kg) [13,14]. However, bears (50-250 kg)
demonstrate a unique pattern of winter hibernation as
they remain at relatively high body temperatures and,
although they keep quiet and largely immobile, they are
capable of arousing and moving throughout the foureight month hibernation period. During hibernation,
bears do not eat, urinate, or defecate [15]. They hibernate with a 20-50% reduction in metabolic rate and the
reduction of heart rate from 60 bpm to 10 bpm [16,17].
Although they are largely inactive during hibernation,
they show no loss in bone mass and less loss in muscle
mass and function than is anticipated over such a prolonged state of immobilization [18]. In contrast to the
near-freezing body temperature in small-sized hibernators ([19], core body temperatures of black bears
(30-150 kg) only decrease to 30-36°C. The periodic
temperature cycling in hibernating bears is also much
less than in the torpor-arousal cycle of ground squirrels.
Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that
regulate bear hibernation could lead to creating novel
therapies for treating human conditions related to
resistance to trauma and recovery during rehabilitation.
To develop genomic resources for the American black
bear (Ursus americanus), the most common and widely
distributed bear species in North America, we have constructed cDNA libraries and sequenced nearly 40,000
Expressed Sequence Tag (EST). An initial study utilizing
these ESTs to construct cDNA arrays and detect gene
expression changes during bear hibernation has been
reported elsewhere [20]. In this study, we focus on the
in-depth analyses of the bear ESTs collection to obtain
the first insights into biological functions, alternative
splicing, tissue-specificity of expression, and molecular
evolution of genes in the bear genome.

Results and Discussion
Bear EST sequencing and alignments on the dog genome

A total of 38,757 EST sequences from Ursus americanus
were generated from cDNA libraries in brain, liver,
heart, skeletal muscle, and testis (Table 1) using a

normalization-subtraction method (See Methods). EST
lengths ranged from 13 - 1,042 base pairs (bps), average
500 bps (Additional file 1, Figure S1; NCBI dbEST database [21] with accession numbers: GW276093 GW314849).
To identify the relative genomic positions and the splicing patterns of bear ESTs, we mapped these 38,757
ESTs onto the dog genome by using the procedure
described in [22]. Dog (Canis familiaris) separated from
bears by about 59.2 MYA [23]. Bear ESTs were first
masked by RepeatMasker [24] and aligned on the dog
genome, downloaded from ENSEMBL, by BLASTN [25].
SIM4 [26] was used to identify splicing sites in corresponding BLAST-hit segments (See Methods). 32,561
(84.0%) bear ESTs can be mapped on the dog genome.
The distribution of the percentage of identities between
the aligned bear ESTs and dog genome is shown in Figure S2 (Additional file 2, Figure S2). On average, bear
EST sequences demonstrated a 91.0% sequence identity
with dog.
We further clustered the aligned bear ESTs with the
help of annotated dog mRNA transcripts. The clustering
process was based on the shared splice sites or the
length of overlap, i.e. two sequences were clustered
together if they shared at least one splice site at the
same orientation, or if they overlap more than half of
the length of the shorter sequence on the genome. After
clustering, we obtained 18,297 “primary EST clusters”.
The redundant “primary EST clusters” that aligned to
multiple genomic loci were further merged together.
Finally, we obtained 10,644 “unique bear EST clusters”.
We selected the primary cluster with the most ESTs to
represent “unique bear EST clusters”. Most of the
unique bear EST clusters (6,409 clusters, 60.2%) are singletons, i.e. containing only one EST. The average number of ESTs per unique bear EST cluster is 3.07. The
distribution of numbers of ESTs per unique EST cluster
is shown in Figure S3 (Additional file 3, Figure S3). The
low EST copy number per EST cluster and high numbers of unique EST clusters indicate that normalization
subtraction method used in cDNA library construction
has substantially increased transcript diversity in our
EST project.
The remaining 6,196 ESTs that failed to be mapped
onto dog genome were assembled into 4,846 EST clusters by CAP3 [27]. Most (4,352 clusters, 90%) of these
EST clusters were singletons. The average number of
ESTs per cluster is 1.28. In contrast to the EST clusters
mapped on dog genome, these clusters mostly represent
rare transcripts.
EST Annotation

All bear ESTs were aligned against human RefSeq
mRNAs http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ by BLASTN.

Zhao et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:201
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/201

A BLAST score higher than 100 was used as the criterion of homologous match. Annotation revealed that
29,160 (75.2%) ESTs matched human gene symbols.
A total of 14,984 (82%) “primary EST clusters” corresponding to 7,680 (72%) “unique bear EST clusters”
were annotated with human gene symbols. For the
remaining “unique bear clusters”, the longest EST in
each cluster was aligned against NCBI NT database,
which contains a much boarder collection of nucleotide
sequences. Using alignment score higher than 100 as
the cutoff, we annotated 778 “unique bear EST clusters”
with known gene symbols. Among the 1,490 “unique
bear EST clusters” without annotation, only nine contained more than five ESTs and seven had an alignment
score higher than 50 when aligned with NT sequences.
This suggested that they were mostly rare unknown
transcripts. In total, we obtained 8,458 (79%) “unique
bear EST clusters” with known gene symbols.
For the ESTs that did not align onto the dog genome,
the contig sequences generated by CAP3 were aligned
against the NT database with BLASTN and a cutoff of
score higher than 100 was used again. A total of 1,231
(25%) EST clusters were annotated with known gene
symbols.
A total of 7,986 EST non-redundant clusters from
black bear were annotated with known gene symbols
and submitted to PANTHER [28] for functional annotations. A total of 4,471, 4,558, and 1,013 genes were classified according to biological process, molecular
function, and biological pathway, respectively. Genes
involved in 11 categories of biological processes were
significantly over-represented (P-value < 1.0 × 10 -10 ,
Bonferroni-corrected) in the EST collection (Figure 1A)
[29]. “Protein metabolism and modification” and “Intracellular protein traffic” categories were the most significantly over-represented in terms of biological processes.
Genes involved in the two categories, “olfaction” and
“chemosensory perception”, of biological processes were
significantly under-represented. Genes assigned to 11
categories of molecular functions were significantly
over-represented in the EST collection. The “oxidoreductase” category was the most significantly over-represented molecular function, whereas “G-protein coupled
receptor” category was significantly under-represented
(Figure 1B). There was no biological pathway category
that passed the criterion (P-value < 1.0 × 10-10 ) to be
significantly enriched.

under the criteria (P-value < 10 -3 , odds ratio > 10).
Among them, six, 18, 15, 32, and one clusters are brain,
liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and testis-specific, respectively. Their expression levels estimated by EST copy
numbers are shown in Figure 2A. Myosin heavy chain
2 (Myh2) and troponin I type 2 (Tnni2), involved in
muscle contraction, were significantly over-represented
in skeleton muscle. Albumin (Alb), involved in fatty acid
transport, was significantly over-represented in liver.
Growth associated protein 43 (Gap43), associated with
neuronal growth cones, demonstrated highly brain-specific expression. Myosin light chain 2 (Myl2), associated
with cardiac myosin beta chain, was over-represented in
heart.
To compare our results with tissue specific gene
expression in other mammals, we downloaded gene
expression profiles estimated from EST copy numbers
of human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), rat
(Rattus norvegicus), dog (Canis lupus familiaris) and pig
(Sus scrofa) from the NCBI Unigene database http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/unigene. Data on expression of
108 homologous genes were obtained in all six species
across the same five tissues (Figure 2B, see Methods).
We first calculated the Pearson correlation coefficients
(r) in pair-wise comparisons of gene expressions as estimated from EST copy numbers between species for
each tissue. The gene expression is highly conserved in
liver across species with average correlation 〈r〉 = 0.87,
while the correlations are much lower in the other four
tissues with 〈r〉 as 0.44, 0.41, 0.45, 0.30 for heart, skeletal
muscle, brain, and testis respectively. We also calculated
the correlation coefficients in pair-wise comparisons
between tissue gene expressions among species for each
gene. A total of 54 genes had consistent expression profiles between bear and at least one out of five other species (Pearson correlation r > 0 and P-value < 0.05). Only
16 out of 108 genes are highly consistent in tissue specific expression profile between any two species among all
six species. For example, apolipoprotein A-I (Apoa1), a
major component of high density lipoprotein, was significantly over-represented in liver in all six mammals.
Proteolipid protein 1 (Plp1), encoding the most abundant myelin protein in the central nervous system, was
highly expressed in brain in all six mammals. However,
most of other studied genes demonstrated species-specific patterns of expression across tissues.
Analysis of splicing variants

Tissue-specific bear gene expression

We used EST copy numbers from brain, liver, heart,
skeletal muscle, and testis as an approximate estimate of
gene expression level across these five tissues [30]. We
performed Fisher’s exact test on 527 clusters with at
least 10 ESTs and identified 72 tissue specific clusters

Alternative splicing is an important mechanism that generates transcript diversity. It is estimated that 94% of
genes may undergo alternative splicing in humans [31].
The alignment of bear ESTs on dog genome provided the
opportunity to reveal alternative splicing patterns in bear.
After removing all ambiguously spliced and non-spliced

Figure 3 Four types of alternative splicing patterns: exon skipping, intron retention, alternative 5’ splicing site, and alternative
3’ splicing site.

bear ESTs, we obtained 2,512 unique bear EST clusters
with at least two spliced bear ESTs containing 15,458
bear ESTs for alternative splicing analysis. A total of 630
clusters (25%) showed alternative splicing and 504 alternative splicing events were classified into four typical
alternative splicing patterns [32]: alternative 5’ site (159
events), alternative 3’ site (141 events), exon skipping
(145 events), and intron retention (59 events) (Figure 3).
To estimate the proportion of conserved splicing
events between bear and dog, we compared the spliced
patterns in bear with those in annotated dog mRNA
transcripts. There are 4,311 unique bear EST clusters
containing at least one spliced bear EST and at least
one spliced dog mRNA transcript. Among 37,874 splice
sites in these clusters, 32,567 (86%) of them can be also
found in dog mRNA transcripts and 2,225 (52%) of
4,311 unique bear EST clusters contain splice sites completely identical to those in dog mRNA transcripts.

Kim et al. [32] reported that exon skipping is the most
abundant alternative splicing events in human, mouse
and rat, and that intron retention is the rarest event. To
compare our results to alternative splicing pattern in
other mammals, we normalized our EST database as
described in Kim et al. [32] by randomly selecting the
same number of ESTs from the EST collection (see
Methods). We observed that about 42% unique bear
EST clusters were alternatively spliced, consistent with
previous findings in other mammals [32]. Our result
revealed that alternative 5’site had the highest occurrence (35%), followed by alternative 3’site (29%), exon
skipping (24%), and intron retention (12%). The proportions of four typical alternative splicing patterns in four
mammalian species are shown in Table 2. Frequency of
alternative splicing patterns in bear was not significantly
different from distribution of splicing events in other
mammalian species (P = 0.3, Chi square test).

EST coverage of protein-coding regions

To estimate the coverage of protein-coding regions in
the bear EST collection, we selected spliced bear ESTs
with identical splicing sites with spliced dog transcripts
or unspliced ESTs overlapped with unspliced dog transcripts. We discarded dog transcripts with ambiguous
start and stop codons. Bear ESTs aligned on more than
one gene or completely fell into the non-coding regions
were also discarded. Finally, we obtained 7,461 bear
ESTs and calculated the positions of 5’ and 3’ ends of
bear ESTs on dog transcripts. For these ESTs, the average coverage of protein-coding regions was 59.2%. In
total, 1,619 ESTs contained complete protein coding
regions, corresponding to 395 ENSEMBL-annotated dog
genes. The distribution of the coverage of protein coding regions was shown in Figure 4A. There is no
obvious bias towards 5’ or 3’ end of protein-coding
regions in bear ESTs (Figure 4B).
Molecular evolution in bear

The phylogenetic relationships between bear and other
mammalian species have been previously inferred from
mitochondrial sequences and a few selected nuclear
gene markers [2,3]. Thus, we had the opportunity to
compare the phylogenetic results derived from the bear
mitochondrial genes with a phylogeny from a large collection of nuclear genes. A total of 15,304 bear ESTs
with coding regions were further assembled into 5,356
EST contigs by CAP3. The protein-coding regions
accounted for 72% of all assembled contig sequences.
The high-quality genome assemblies from three other
mammalian species: cow, dog, and human were downloaded from ENSEMBL. Orthologous gene annotations
were obtained from Ensembl-Compara database. Multiple sequence alignments of orthologous genes were generated by MUSCLE program.
Maximum likelihood method was used to reconstruct
the phylogenetic tree of the four species from a concatenated alignment of the coding regions of 2,655 nuclear
genes and 13 mitochondrial genes respectively with the
GTR nucleotide substitution model after multiple hit
corrections (Additional file 4, Figure S4). The phylogenetic tree derived from the bear nuclear genes has the
same topology as the one derived from mitochondrial

genes. Then, Ka (non-synonymous substitution rate)
and Ks (synonymous substitution rate) values of each
lineage were calculated under the free ratio model in
PAML package (Table 3). Although there are considerable variations of Ka and Ks among different mammalian lineages as estimated from nuclear genes as well as
mitochondrial genes, the ratios between Ka and Ks
(Ka/Ks) from nuclear genes showed smaller variation
among species compared to mitochondrial genes. Ka/Ks
in the bear lineage estimated from nuclear genes was
compatible with those in other lineages (Table 3), indicating that the selection constraint in bear did not show
significant differences from other mammals on the global nuclear genomic scale.
Next, we searched for specific genes with rapid evolutionary rates in the bear lineage using the likelihood
ratio test implemented by PAML program. In total, 154
genes had significantly higher Ka/Ks values (P < 0.05,
likelihood ratio test (LRT)) in the bear lineage than in
the other lineages (Additional file 5, Table S1). After
manually checking the alignments, the results of 18
genes with coding sequence (CDS) coverage larger than
80% were listed together with their biological functions
in Table 4. They are involved in diverse biological functions including PNPLA4 in lipid catabolism, CDC42SE1
in cell cycle, and TMED2 in vesicle-mediated transport.
In particular, three genes: Phospholamban (PLN),
cysteine glycine-rich protein 3 (CSRP3), and Troponin I
type 3 (TNNI3), are involved in heart contraction. PLN
inhibits cardiac muscle sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+
pump when it is unphosphorylated. Upon PLN’s phosphorylation, Ca 2+ pump will be activated leading to
muscle relaxation. Defects in PLN in human are a cause
of dilated cardiomyopathy 1P (CMD1P). CSRP3 is
expressed specifically in heart (Figure 2A). CSRP3 is
associated with regulation of heart contraction and skeletal muscle development. Defects in CSRP3 are a cause
of dilated cardiomyopathy 1M (CMD1M). TNNI3 is the
cardiac protein of troponin I, the inhibitory subunit of
troponin. Troponin I blocks actin-myosin interactions
and plays an important role in the relaxation of striated
muscle. Defects in this gene in human can lead to familial hypertrophic cardiomyophathy type 7 (CMH7) and
restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM).

Rates of evolution were estimated from the alignment of concatenated
nuclear and mitochondria coding sequences; (Ka) nonsynonymous
substitution per codon; (Ks) synonymous substitution per codon.

We then used branch-site model to test whether any
codon sites of the rapid evolving genes show positive
selection signal in the bear lineage. Two of 18 genes,
biphenyl hydrolase-like (BPHL) and cysteine glycine-rich
protein 3 (CSRP3), contained codon sites with the Ka/
Ks significantly greater than one (P < 0.05) as estimated
by the Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) method [33]. We
subsequently added protein coding sequences of BPHL
and CSRP3 from more mammalian species including
cat, mircobat, megabat, alpaca, horse and hedgehog, to
the four species and tested whether this would affect the
results of positive selection detection. The candidate site

(19I) in BPHL still showed 99.1% probability of being
positively selected. BPHL has hydrolase activity and may
be involved in detoxification process. The putative positive selected site (19I) in BPHL fell in the signal peptide
domain. For CSRP3, although the bear lineage still
showed a higher Ka/Ks value comparing to the rest of
the phylogeny (P = 0.02, LRT), the candidate site (60T)
was identified now with a lower probability (88.7%) of
being positively selected along the bear lineage. The
putative positive selected site (60T) in CSRP3 fell in the
zinc-binding domain. The multiple alignment of CSRP3
protein sequences was shown in Figure 5A and corresponding nucleotide sequence alignment shown in Figure S5 (Additional file 6, Figure S5). There was also the
substitution of valine by isoleucine at the 60th codon in
cat lineage. We obtained 3-D structure of human
CSRP3 proteins from Protein Data Bank (PDB) database
(PDB id: 2o13). The amino acid change from valine
(Val) in human, cow, horse, microbat, megabat, alpaca,
and dog to threonine (Thr) in bear at 60th amino acid
may potentially affect the structure of its N-terminal
LIM domain. This is likely to change the conformation
of domain by introducing a polar interaction between a
hydroxyl group of the threonine and the zinc ion

Figure 5 Protein sequence alignment and 3D protein structure of CSRP3. (A) Multiple sequence alignment of full-length CSRP3 protein
sequences in nine species. The LIM1 zinc-binding domain is marked with grey and the 60th site is highlighted in blue. The corresponding nucleotide
sequence alignment is shown in Figure S5 (Additional file 6, Figure S5). (B) 3D protein structure of human CSRP3 LIM1 domain obtained from Protein
Database (PDB id: 2o13). Two dash lines show distances between the zinc ion and the methyl groups of the valine residue.

(Figure 5B). In contrast, the substitution by isoleucine,
another aromatic acid, at this site in the cat lineage would
not change the conformation of LIM1 domain as much as
the threonine substitution does in bear lineage. Experiments in human have demonstrated that the altered conformation of CSRP3 from the mutations at 44th, 55th and

58th site in LIM1 domain can lead to a decreased binding
activity of muscle LIM protein (MLP) to a-actinin and
titin-cap (T-cap or telethonin) [34]. MLP/T-cap complex
is a key component of cardiac mechanical stretch sensor
system. The defect in CSRP3 may result in human dilated
cardiomyopathy and heart failure [35].

Evolution rate of hibernation-related genes

The phylogenetic distribution of hibernating and
non-hibernating species is wide-ranging and interspersed.
It is highly unlikely that hibernation phenotype has arisen
independently in these hibernating species. So far, there
has been no evidence for the creation of novel genes
responsible for hibernation phenotype. Therefore, it is
more likely that hibernation results from the differential
expression of existing genes that have widely and long
existed among mammals [8,12]. To address whether bear
genes involved in hibernation were evolving faster or
slower, we identified hibernation-related genes as those
genes that showed significant differential expression on
cDNA arrays between bears sampled during hibernation
and non-hibernation season (P < 0.05, one-way ANOVA)
[20]. Among the 18 genes that we identified as fastevolving genes in bear, there were four hibernationrelated genes: APOH (liver), PLN (skeletal muscle),
RBM8A (skeletal muscle), and ATP6V1F (heart). RBM8A
was over-expressed during bear hibernation, while the
other three genes were under-expressed.
To further examine the selection pressure on hibernation-related genes on a global scale, we compared the
Ka/Ks ratios (bear vs. dog) between hibernation-related
genes and other bear genes. The distributions of Ka/Ks
values of hibernation-related and other genes are shown
in Figure 6. We observed that hibernation-related genes
showed a significantly lower Ka/Ks values in heart
(P = 5 × 10-4, Wilcoxon’s rank test) and skeletal muscle
(P = 0.01) compared to the rest of the genes, indicating
a stronger level of evolutionary constraint on them. This
result was also consistent with our previous observation
that the proportion of genes involved in protein
biosynthesis and translation process was significantly
elevated among the over-expressed genes during hibernation [20]. Most of these genes such as ribosomal
proteins are housekeeping genes and typically experience highly negative selection [36]. Thus, the genes that
control key physiological processes in bear hibernation
tend to be more conserved rather than fast evolving.
Web-based Ursus americanus EST database

A web-based Ursus americanus EST database with a
user-friendly interface was constructed to provide assess
to the bear EST collection and demonstrate our analysis
http://www.picb.ac.cn/bearest/bearest.jsp. The queries of
bear EST IDs, annotations, tissue sources, and splicing
patterns on the dog genome are available on the
website.

Conclusions
In this study, we reported the first collection of 38,757
ESTs of American black bear from normalized

Page 11 of 16

subtracted cDNA libraries constructed from five tissues,
brain, liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and testis. Assembling
these ESTs onto dog genome yielded 10,644 “unique
bear EST clusters” indicating that our gene discovery
strategy has resulted in wide coverage and low redundancy of the EST collection. Functional annotation and
enrichment analyses showed that the EST collection
represents genes with diverse biological functions. Some
of genes showed significant tissue-specific expression
that is comparable with tissue-specific expression of
their orthologous genes in other mammalian species.
We also studied frequencies of four most common alternative splicing patterns in the bear ESTs sequences [32].
Similar to in other mammals, intron retention is the
least common alternative splicing event in the bear.
However, alternative 3’ or 5’ splicing site, instead of
exon skipping in other mammals, are the most frequent
splicing events in bear.
This first large-scale bear EST project provides a valuable genomic resource to study molecular evolution in
bear phylogeny. Using the bear EST collection, we compared the selection pressure exerted on nuclear genes in
the bear with those in other mammalian species and
identified the genes showing fast evolutionary rate in
the bear lineage. These genes have broad biological
functions such as metabolism, cell cycle, and vesiclemediated transport. Three of these genes (PLN, CSRP3,
and TNNI3) are associated with cardiac muscle contraction. Two of these genes, BPHL and CSPR3 contain
codon sites showing positive selection signal in the bear
lineage. The analysis on the 3D structure of CSRP3
zinc-binding domain indicates that this bear-specific
amino acid substitution in CSRP3 may have a significant
impact on its structure. As several heart disease-related
mutations have been observed in the same domain in
CSRP3, it is tempting to suggest that this bear-specific
substitution may confer adaptive advantage for bear
heart during biological processes such as hibernation.
However, molecular evolution leading to adaptation is a
complex issue and all fast-evolving and putative positive
selected genes identified in this study may or may not
be related to hibernation per se in bear. The real biological functions and implications related to these genes
have yet to be demonstrated. Genes differentially
expressed during hibernation showed signs of higher
negative selection pressure comparing to other genes.
This provides supportive evidence for the hypothesis
that the hibernation phenotype results from differential
expression of conserved genes, rather than rapid evolutionary origin of novel hibernation specific genes. Future
research combining gene expression studies, functional
studies, and genome sequencing will shed new light on
the evolution of molecular functions in bear species.

Methods

RNA preparation

Animals

Total RNA was extracted from frozen tissues by grinding in liquid nitrogen with mortar and pestle and using
RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). Skeleton muscle tissue was treated
by proteinase K and RNA was extracted by using
RNeasy Fibrous Tissue Kit (Qiagen). All RNA samples
were processed by DNase I (Qiagen) treatment. For
cDNA library construction, mRNA was selected from
total RNA with the oligo(dT) cellulose by the use of
Poly(A) Purist Kit (Ambion). RNA quality was assessed
by 1.2% agarose gel electrophoresis and concentration
was measured by using Nanodrop.

American black bears (31-143 kg) were captured in
May-July from the field either near McGrath or
Anchorage, Alaska. Bears were transferred to Fairbanks, Alaska, where they were held individually in a
shaded outdoor holding facility. After euthanasia, tissue samples were taken in 12 minutes and frozen
immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.
Animal protocols were approved by the University of
Alaska Fairbanks Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.

cDNA library construction and sequencing

Normalized cDNA libraries enriched for full-length inserts
were constructed from brain, liver, testis, heart, and skeleton muscle. For each library except for testis and liver
(hibernating animal only), we pooled mRNA samples isolated from hibernating and summer active bears. During
reverse transcription, adaptors containing the rare for
mammalian genomes, asymmetrical restriction sites for
SfiI were incorporated into the first strand of the cDNA
using a SMART template switching mechanism at the 5’end of the transcript [37]. In order to decrease redundancy, most libraries were normalized by hybridization of
the single strand cDNA with the same quantity of mRNA
that was used for first strand synthesis [38]. To further
decrease redundancy, two cDNA libraries from brain (007)
and liver (008) were subtracted in addition to normalization. To construct subtraction drivers, 1,000 - 2,000 clones
already sequenced from brain (001, 003) and liver (UAhib,
006) libraries were plated on LB-agarose and plasmid
DNA was extracted by using QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit
(Qiagen). Using the plasmid DNA as a template, the
cDNA inserts were amplified by PCR with M13 universal
primers. RNA subtraction drivers were obtained from
PCR product by using in vitro transcription with Maxi
Script T7 Kit (Ambion). The RNA subtraction driver was
pooled with normalization driver, labeled with biotin, and
hybridized with the first strand cDNA using the same protocol as used for normalization [38].
Second strand synthesis of cDNA was performed by
the use of primer extension PCR (Advantage 2 Taq
Polymerase, Clontech) with limited (10 - 15) number of
cycles. The double stranded cDNA was digested with
SfiI, size fractionated through Sephacryl - 500 column
(Amersham), and directionally cloned into the SfiI predigested vector DNR-LIB (Clontech). The first fulllength cDNA library from liver (UAhib) was constructed
without SMART template-switching and PCR amplification as described [39], and inserts were cloned into vector pCMV-SPORT6 (Invitrogen). Libraries were
transformed to DH10B E. coli (Invitrogen) by using
electroporation. Full details of the cDNA libraries constructed for this study are available at http://compbio.
dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/cgi-bin/tgi/T_release.pl?gudb=bear.
From each library, expressed sequence tags (EST) were
generated from the 5’-end with the universal M13 forward primer.
Genome Alignment of EST sequences and clustering

The genome sequence of 7.5X assembly of domestic dog
was obtained from ENSEMBL (release 50, http://www.
ensembl.org/Canis_familiaris/Info/Index). There are
23,550 genes annotated in the dog genome including
the protein coding genes, pseudo gene, miRNA, rRNA,

Page 13 of 16

and tRNA. The bear ESTs were masked by RepeatMasker (-species mammal -norna) and then aligned on the
dog genome by BLASTN with default parameters. The
output file was parsed using E-value of 1.0 × 10-10 as
the upper limit and obtained the corresponding genomic
sequences with 40 kb flanking region in both ends. We
mapped the original ESTs on the extracted genomic
sequences with SIM4 (A = 4, P = 1) to extract the alignment and splice site information. The ESTs alignment
lengths on the genome longer than 50% of ESTs lengths
and the alignment identity higher than 85% were used
as the cutoff for assigning significant homology.
The EST alignments were clustered together with dog
gene annotation (Canis_familiaris.BROADD2.50.gtf). We
obtained “primary EST clusters”, based on the same splicing sites and overlap, i.e., they were clustered if they
shared at least one common splice site or they overlapped at least 50% length of the shorter sequence.
Because of the duplication in the dog, there are redundancy existing in “primary EST Clusters”, and we clustered them further if one cluster was a subset of the
other and obtained “unique bear EST clusters”.
Bear tissue-specific gene expression

We carried out 2 × 2 fisher’s exact test for fives tissues
on 572 clusters which had at least 10 ESTs. P-value <
10 -3 and odds ratio > 10 were used as the criteria to
identify the tissue specific genes. The expression profiles
of five mammals (Canis lupus familiaris, Homo sapiens,
Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus and Sus scrofa) based
on ESTs were downloaded from Unigene ftp http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/unigene. We compared 572 bear
clusters with those of homologous genes in the other
five species. For the genes with more than one Unigene
clusters, the one with the largest EST copy number was
selected. We obtained Pearson correlations and P-values
under two-sided test between any two species.
Alternative splicing analysis

In the bear EST clusters, un-spliced ESTs or spliced
ESTs that had undetermined intron direction ("B” or
“N” in the result of SIM4) or opposite orientation were
discarded. Dog mRNA transcripts were filtered with
same criteria. We only kept clusters with more than two
transcripts which contained at least one bear EST. Splicing events were identified when two transcripts have at
least one common splice site and one different splice
site. An in-house script was used to identify the four
types of alternative splicing pattern.
We applied the normalization method described in
Eddo kim’s paper, i.e., EST clusters with at least 10
unambiguously spliced ESTs were selected, then we randomly extracted 10 ESTs and performed alternative

Zhao et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:201
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/201

splicing analysis. We repeated the process for 100 times
and the mean value of numbers of alternative splicing
was calculated.
Phylogenetic analysis

We selected the bear ESTs with identical splicing sites
in the overlapping genomic region with the corresponding dog transcripts. CAP3 program was use to assemble
the multiple ESTs of the same cluster into contig
sequences [27]. The longest contig sequence was chosen
to represents the longest bear transcript in each cluster.
Orthologous gene information in mammalian species
was retrieved from the ENSEMBL Compara database
[40]. Protein coding sequences (CDS) of each orthologous gene were also retrieved from three high-quality
genomes including human, cow and dog (ENSEMBL
Version 50.1). Bear protein sequences were obtained by
translating the bear transcripts using the same open
reading frame as in other species.
The alignments of orthologous protein sequences
from multiple species were done by the program MUSCLE using default parameters [41]. For each orthologous
gene, we calculated non-synonymous rate (Ka) and
synonymous rate (Ks) in pairwise species comparison
using the codeml program of the PAML software package [42]. The group with more than one pair showing
unusually high substitution rate (Ka > = 0.25 and/or Ks
> = 5) was discarded. A super CDS was generated by
concatenating the CDS fragments of aligned genes. For
the super CDS alignment as well as each individual CDS
alignment, the phylogenetic trees were generated by
maximum likelihood methods based on different substitution models (GTR, TN93, T92, HKY85, F84, F81 and
K80). Different substitution models yielded very similar
results and GTR model with multiple hit corrections
was eventually used in this study. Then, the Ka and Ks
rates of each lineage were estimated with the codeml
program under the free ratio model. For comparison,
the Ka and Ks rates for the protein coding regions concatenated from 13 mitochondrial genes were also generated as the same method above.
Likelihood ratio test for molecular evolution in bear

We removed the gaps and highly divergent regions showing contiguous mismatches in one lineage that could be
caused by alternative splicing or frame-shift indels. The
genes with the common length of multiple alignments
less than 80% of the human CDS regions were also eliminated. The underlying phylogeny was assumed to be
{{{bear, dog}, cow}, human} for all genes. The branch
model in codeml of the PAML package was used to estimate the Ka/Ks ratio (ω) along the bear lineage and all
other lineages. To test whether Ka/Ks ratio was significantly different between the bear lineage and other

Page 14 of 16

lineages, we computed the maximum likelihood ratio
between two hypotheses: two different Ka/Ks ratios and
constant Ka/Ks ratios along all lineages [42]. Two times
the log likelihood ratio (2Δ) was transformed into
p-values using chi-square test. P-value < 0.05 was used as
the criterion to select candidate genes showing significant
difference in Ka/Ks ratio. Further, branch-site model was
implemented to identify the specific coding sites under
positive selection. To increase the confidence of positive
selection detection, we then later added homologous fulllength coding regions available in other mammalian species including cat, microbat, megabat, alpaca, horse and
hedgehog to the four species tree. The likelihood ratio
test was based on the potential phylogeny {{{{{{bear, dog},
cat}, horse}, {microbat, megabat}}, {cow, alpaca}}, human}
for CSRP3 and {{{{{dog, bear}, {microbat, megabat}},
cow}, hedgehog}, human} for BPHL.
Database design

The web interface of the bear EST database was written
in JavaServer Pages (JSP). After we mapped EST
sequences to the dog genome, a track file containing the
physical positions of each exon was created and then
uploaded to UCSC web browser. The splicing patterns
of all ESTs could be visualized under UCSC annotated
platform.
