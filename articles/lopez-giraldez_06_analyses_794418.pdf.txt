Abstract
Background: The popularity of microsatellites has greatly increased in the last decade on account
of their many applications. However, little is currently understood about the factors that influence
their genesis and distribution among and within species genomes. In this work, we analyzed
carnivore microsatellite clones from GenBank to study their association with interspersed repeats
and elucidate the role of the latter in microsatellite genesis and distribution.
Results: We constructed a comprehensive carnivore microsatellite database comprising 1236
clones from GenBank. Thirty-three species of 11 out of 12 carnivore families were represented,
although two distantly related species, the domestic dog and cat, were clearly overrepresented. Of
these clones, 330 contained tRNALys-derived SINEs and 357 contained other interspersed repeats.
Our rough estimates of tRNA SINE copies per haploid genome were much higher than published
ones. Our results also revealed a distinct juxtaposition of AG and A-rich repeats and tRNALysderived SINEs suggesting their coevolution. Both microsatellites arose repeatedly in two regions of
the insterspersed repeat. Moreover, microsatellites associated with tRNALys-derived SINEs
showed the highest complexity and less potential instability.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that tRNALys-derived SINEs are a significant source for
microsatellite generation in carnivores, especially for AG and A-rich repeat motifs. These
observations indicate two modes of microsatellite generation: the expansion and variation of preexisting tandem repeats and the conversion of sequences with high cryptic simplicity into a repeat
array; mechanisms which are not specific to tRNALys-derived SINEs. Microsatellite and interspersed
repeat coevolution could also explain different distribution of repeat types among and within
species genomes.
Finally, due to their higher complexity and lower potential informative content of microsatellites
associated with tRNALys-derived SINEs, we recommend avoiding their use as genetic markers.

Background
Eukaryote genomes contain repetitive DNA sequences
that can be classified into two groups: tandemly repeated
sequences (e.g., micro- and minisatellites) and dispersed
sequences (e.g., long interspersed elements – LINEs – and
short interspersed elements – SINEs). Microsatellites
(MSs) are tandem repeats of a DNA motif, one to six bases
long, showing high levels of polymorphism based on
changes in the repeat number. They are highly abundant
and considered selectively neutral sequences and almost
randomly distributed in the mammalian genome [1]. In
spite of the wide applications of MSs and their importance
in genetic and evolutionary studies, the mechanisms of
the genesis of these sequences are still not fully understood. It is thought that point mutation is the dominant
source of generation of short repeat MSs before slippage
becomes the dominant mechanism [2-5]. However, based
on the close association described between retroposons
and MSs in several mammalian species (in sheep [6]; in
pig [7]; in primates [8]; in humans [9]; in horse [10]), a
completely different mechanism for MS generation has
been proposed: it is thought that retrotranscripts undergo
3' polyadenylation – similar to mRNA polyadenylation
[11] – prior to their incorporation into the genome, and
that the extension of this preexisting repeat can generate
A-rich MSs [8,9]. Nevertheless, this mechanism would not
explain the recent observations (in barley, [12]; in Dipterans, [13]) that MSs can also be associated with both 5' and
internal regions of some retroposons. An explanation for
the latter association is the mechanism described by
Wilder and Hollocher [13] which implies the conversion
of an existing sequence with high cryptic simplicity
located in Dipteran mini-me elements into tandemly
repeated DNA. The importance of repeat elements as MS
sources is still unclear. Whereas Nadir et al. [9] proposed
Alu elements as the preferential source for the origin of
human MSs, Morgante et al. [14] showed a significant

association between MSs and the single/low-copy fraction
of the plant genome.
In mammals, most retroposons can be classified into
three basic types: SINEs, LINEs, and LTR (Long Terminal
Repeat) elements, with SINEs being the most abundant.
SINEs are 80–400 bp long genomic repeats, apparently
originating from tRNA (with the exception of human Alu
and rodent B1 families which are derived from 7SL cytoplasmatic RNA, [15]). A typical SINE is flanked by short
direct repeats and consists of three regions: a tRNA-related
region, which contains an internal promoter for RNA
polymerase III; a central family-specific or tRNA-unrelated
region; and an A-rich tail (fig. 1; for a review of SINEs, see
[16]). In carnivores, the tRNA-derived SINEs (tRNA
SINEs), also known as CAN-SINEs, are thought to derive
from tRNALys [17]. They are also characterized by a
polypyrimidine region (poly-Y) in their central region,
and a polyadenylation AATAAA signal and the RNA
polymerase III TTTT or TCTT terminator in the A-rich tail
[17,18]. The tRNA-related region is more conserved than
the unrelated part and the RNA polymerase III promoter
is the most conserved, while poly-Y and A-rich tail are
highly variable both in sequence and in length [17]. At
first, it was thought that tRNA SINE distribution was limited to doglike carnivores (Canoidea superfamily; e.g.:
dogs, bears, raccoons, weasels, skunks, and seals). However, recent works [17,18] have detected the tRNA SINE in
the genome of several species of catlike carnivores (Feloidea superfamily; e.g.: hyenas, cats, mongooses, and civets)
but not beyond carnivores.
In this study we constructed a comprehensive database of
carnivore MS clones from GenBank to explore the role of
interspersed repeats in the generation of repeat arrays. We
focused on tRNA SINEs which constitute the best characterized and most abundant interspersed repeat element in

the carnivore genome. We observed two modes of MS
genesis in two regions of tRNA SINEs in which MSs have
repeatedly evolved. This observation led us to hypothesize
that SINEs generating MSs could explain part of the different repeat array content and distribution among and
within genomes. We also demonstrated that MSs associated with tRNA SINEs were more complex and had less
potential instability than those not associated. The observations reported here therefore have practical implications since the use of MSs related with tRNA SINEs calls
for special attention from the designing of experiments to
the interpretation of results.

Results
Database description
We obtained a non-redundant database of 1236 MS-containing clones for a total length of 515,359 bp representing 33 species from 11 of the 12 carnivore families (see
table 1). The Mephitidae family was not included. However, there was a clear overrepresentation of domestic cat
(Felis catus), contributing 40.8% of the total number of
clones and 33.6% of total length, and domestic dog (Canis
familiaris), with 15.0% and 23.7%, respectively. Each one
of these two distantly related species is representative of
the two major clades of carnivores: Feloidea and Canoidea superfamilies. The rest of the species contributed less
than 8% of the two values, number of clones and
sequence length.
Identification and characterization of interspersed repeat
elements
RepeatMasker masked 687 (55.5%) clones; of these, 330
contained tRNA SINEs, 292 LINEs, 93 LTR elements, 75
MIRs (mammalian-wide interspersed repeat), and 48
DNA transposons. It was possible for the same clone to
contain more than one kind of interspersed repeat. In the
330 tRNA SINE-containing clones, we found 362 tRNA
SINEs of which 47 were full-size. Thirty-two clones therefore contained two SINEs, in 27 of which they were oriented in the same way. We also explored the non-masked
clone sequences using pairwise comparisons with BLAST
to search for potentially new repeat elements but no new
elements were found.

We obtained a rough estimate of the number of tRNA
SINE copies per haploid genome for those species with
the highest number of clones (table 1). We estimated
2.1*106 tRNA SINEs in cat, 9.1*105 in dog, 2.3*106 in
badger, 2.0*106 in giant panda, and 4.5*106 in spotted
hyena.
Repeat motifs associated with interspersed repeat
elements
A Sputnik search in our database for MSs revealed 1695
repeat arrays in the 1236 clone sequences. Table 2 shows

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/269

the most abundant (found >5 times) repeat motifs. We
identified 58 out of the 151 possible motifs from monomer to pentamer. The 72.1% of the repeat arrays were
dinucleotides and 16.4% were tetranucleotides, while
mono-, tri- and pentanucleotides each accounted for less
than 5% of the total. None of the representatives of the
(CRG)n MS family, which are mainly located either within
or very close to coding sequences [19], was found. All tri, tetra- and pentanucleotides have an A in their repeat
unit.
When Sputnik was applied to the masked clones, we
found that 557 and 454 out of the 1695 repeat arrays were
associated with tRNA SINEs and other repeats, respectively. Out of 58 repeat motifs, 10 were not represented in
the masked sequences, but this could be due to their low
abundance in the whole database (each was found only 1
to 3 times).
Implications of tRNA SINEs for the genesis of MSs
Overall, the abundance of motifs differs among databases
(P < .0001; table 2). When pairwise comparisons were
conducted, there were no significant differences in motif
abundance between non-masked and other repeats clones
(P = .0862) but there were significant differences between
tRNA SINE and the other two databases (P values <
.0001).

The tRNA SINE clones had a highly significant lack of AC
repeats (22.5%, Fisher exact test, P < .0001) and an abundance of AG (65.9%, Fisher exact test, P < .0001) and
AAAT (86.4%, Fisher exact test, P < .0001) repeats compared with the combined values of the other two databases (table 2). To know in detail how these differences
were produced, we classified MSs in relation to the location in the tRNA SINE clones (fig. 1, fig. 2 and Supplementary Material table 1 [see Additional files 1]). Again,
we found high significant differences in the overall motif
distribution within the tRNA SINE clone sequence (P <
.0001) and in pairwise comparisons among the different
regions: poly-Y, A-rich tail and other parts (all three comparisons yielded a P < .0001). Poly-Y region had a highly
significant abundance of AG repeats (86.8%, Fisher exact
test, P < .0001) and the A-rich tail had a high number of
A (70.8%, Fisher exact test, P < .0001), AAAG (66.7%,
Fisher exact test, P = .0002), AAAT (85.5%, Fisher exact
test, P < .0001), and AAAAT (85.7%, Fisher exact test, P <
.0014) repeats. In addition, both regions showed a lack of
AC repeats (15.1% and 11.1% respectively, Fisher exact
test, P-values < .0001). No MSs were found in any other
parts of the SINE sequences.
These results were based on the 330 tRNA SINE-containing clones but only 188 of these (15.1% of the total
number of clones) had both poly-Y and A-rich tail (fig. 1).

In the other clones, these regions were either not clearly
distinguishable (N = 25) or there was only a fragment of
the tRNA related region (N = 117). Taking into account
only those clones containing SINEs with both regions, we
observed that 65.0% of the poly-Y and 53.2% of the A-rich
tail generated MSs. In these clones, 314 MSs were found
to be distributed as follows: 51.3% in poly-Y, 42.7% in Arich tail, and 6.1% downstream from the SINE. In a
detailed analysis of the SINE sequence (fig. 2 and Supplementary Material table 1 [see Additional files 1]), the
poly-Y tract produced 11 repeat motifs, which were
mainly AG (73.3%) repeats. On the other hand, A-rich tail

produced a higher motif diversity (17 repeat motifs),
although these were limited to A-rich MSs. Thus, although
only 188 clones had both regions, these differences in distribution of MSs among databases were mainly produced
by poly-Y region which concentrated 55.1% of the AG and
only 3.1% of AC repeats found in the whole database and
by the A-rich tail which concentrated 71.2% of the AAAT
and only 2.2% of AC repeats found in the whole database.
To discard that the observed significant tendencies were a
result of the bias in species composition, we repeated the
same statistical analyses with three different subsets of

data: one containing only domestic dog clones, the second including cat clones, and the third compiling clones
from other carnivore species. In all cases we observed the
same tendencies corroborating that our findings are a
common pattern in carnivores. The abundance of motifs
among the databases and the statistics for these three subsets are shown in the Supplementary Material Table 2–4
[see Additional files 2, 3, 4]. We also repeated all the following analyses for these subsets.
Implications of tRNA-SINEs for MS instability
Although we could not measure MS polymorphism,
repeat array length correlates well with MS instability.

Overall, dimers and tetramers presented highly significant
differences in size frequency distributions (fig. 3; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, N = 1500, Z = 8.326, P < .0001).
In general, the most common allele for dimer distribution
was shifted further from the minimum MS size than
tetramers (fig. 3). When comparing dimer distribution
between MSs in non-masked clones and poly-Y region –
which mainly produced dimers (see above) -, we observed
that poly-Y region became more truncated and had
shorter alleles (Fig 3). For tetramers, the shape of size frequency distribution is similar in both databases but A-rich
tail – which mainly produced tetramers (see above) – had
usually shorter alleles than non-masked clones (Fig. 3).
Mean array length can be used to summarize the location
of the frequency distribution, although this does not capture the entire spectrum of variation in these non-normal
distributions (fig. 3; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Dimers N
= 1222, Z = 1.938, P = .0011; Tetramer N = 278, Z = 4.736,
P < .0001). On average for dimers, arrays in non-masked
clones and poly-Y region had 17.0543 and 13.723 repeats,
respectively. For this class, poly-Y region contained significantly shorter arrays than non-masked clones (MannWhitney U test; N = 682, Z = -6.240, P < .0001). On average for tetramers, arrays in non-masked clones and A-rich
tail had 11.326 and 10.338 repeats, respectively. For this
class, the A-rich tail generated significantly shorter arrays
than non-masked clones (Mann-Whitney U test; N = 151,
Z = -3.709, P = .0002). As we did for the other analyses,
we also repeated these comparisons for the three subsets,
except for tetramer within cats, which have a small sample
size (N = 7). We obtained the same results with one exception (data not shown). We did not find significant differences when comparing tetramer MSs contained in nonmasked clones and A-rich tail within dog but this is
explained by an outlayer length value (Fig 3). When this
value is removed from the analysis, differences become
statistically significant (data not shown).
It is important to note that these comparisons do not represent assessments of orthologous loci, they represent one
randomly chosen allele from each of many microsatellite
loci within a species. Thus, the observed length variation
among our tRNA-SINE clones may be due to variation
among tRNA-SINE family or subfamily sequences. However, slippage occurs in MSs located in poly-Y and A-rich
region, generating length variability within species after
the insertion of the SINE. This can be observed in published tRNA-SINE clones containing a single variable MS
in either poly-Y and A-rich tail (e.g. doglike: domestic dog
[20], Eurasian badger (Meles meles) [21], American marten
(Martes Americana), wolverine (Gulo gulo), and American
badger (Taxidea taxus) [22]; catlike: spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) [23], Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) [24],
and small Indian mongoose (Herpestes javanicus) [25]).

Implications of tRNA-SINEs for MS complexity
To elucidate whether the contiguous existence of poly-Y
and A-rich tail or similar structures in other interspersed
repeats may be a source of compound MSs, we compared
the presence of this kind of MSs among databases. Out of
550 non-masked clones, 66 contained compound arrays.
The number of compounds was not significantly different
from that calculated from the tRNA SINE (46 compounds
in 330 clones, Fisher's exact test, P = .263) and other
repeats (50 compounds in 357 clones, Fisher's exact test,
P = .249) databases. Even when we calculated the number
of compounds in the tRNA SINEs database taking into
account only clones with both poly-Y tract and A-rich tail,
there were no significant differences between databases
(data not shown). Moreover, we did not find any significant increase in the number of compound MSs in the
SINE database when we changed the number of nonrepeat nucleotides separating two adjacent arrays (data
not shown). However, the presence of these two regions
(poly-Y and A-rich tail) should imply a source of multiple
arrays in the same clone. The number of clones with multiple arrays in tRNA SINE sequences was 146 which was
significantly higher than the number calculated for nonmasked sequences (128 multiples in 550 clones, Fisher's
exact test, P < .0001) and for other repeats (85 multiples
in 357 clones, Fisher's exact test, P < .0001).

On the other hand, of the 684 repeat arrays in nonmasked clones, 181 were imperfect and this number was
not significantly different from the number calculated for
tRNA SINEs (156 imperfects, Fisher's exact test, P = .2928)
and for other repeats (115 imperfects, Fisher's exact test, P
= .3613).
The same tendencies were apparent when the three species
subsets were analysed separately (data not shown).

Discussion
Our database was generated from MS-containing clones
of carnivore species which are generally used in population genetics and individual identification studies. These
MSs had been isolated following the traditional method,
which is known to produce a nonrepresentative sample of
the genome. Two common procedures repeatedly used in
traditional MS isolation that may cause biases in our database are: i) the use of Sau3AI restriction enzyme to fragment genomic DNA, and ii) the use of AC probes to screen
the libraries. However, and despite the biases inherent in
isolation methods, the drawn conclusions are still pertinent or in some cases even reinforced (see below).
Sau3AI recognizes sites that are well-conserved in dispersed repeats (e.g., in porcine PRE-1, in rat L1 elements),
and in the B-box of the tRNA polymerase III promoter of
our tRNA SINEs. As a result, the SINEs found in our data-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/269

bases were often truncated (87.0%), conserving the 5' end
in 127 cases and the 3' end, including the poly-Y and Arich tail regions, in 188 cases. We found 47 full tRNA
SINEs which could be used as phylogenetic markers. This
fact has led some authors (e.g. [26,27]) to state that the
use of Sau3AI may result in bias towards the isolation of
repeat-associated MSs. However, such a bias could not
exist taking into account the high frequency of cutting
owing to the restriction recognition site for Sau3AI
(^GATC) is only four nucleotides in length.
The preferential use of (AC)n probes for library screening
was reflected in the repeat motif content of our database
where 58% were AC repeats, clearly overrepresented [28].
However, in this work we have demonstrated that AC
repeats are not statistically associated with tRNA-SINEs –
only 5.3% of the AC repeats in the whole database were
located within the SINE sequence. Similar results have
been found in humans where more than 80% of AC
repeats are not associated with Alu sequences [8,9,29].
Using AC probes would therefore reduce the final number
of SINEs captured in the MS isolation process.
Our tRNA SINE copy estimates per haploid genome in
dog (9.1*105) were very similar to the values obtained
from the dog genome sequence (1.06*106 [30]). It seems
then reasonable to think that the values we obtained for
the other carnivore species (2.1*106 tRNA SINEs in cat,
2.3*106 in badger, 2.0*106 in giant panda, and 4.5*106 in
spotted hyena) may also be realistic approximations. Even
in the case where the above mentioned biases do apply –
probably reducing tRNA SINE captured -, it is unlikely
they would produce a difference of an order of magnitude
with published estimates (105 – 3*105 in mustelids, 2*105
in cats and true seals, and 1.5*105 – 4*105 in dogs and
bears [17,26,31,32]).
We also observed that poly-Y (65.0%) and A-rich tail
(53.2%) regularly gave rise to MSs. The different repeat
motifs derived from these regions (mostly AG and AAAT,
respectively) suggested two mechanisms for MS generation. The first mechanism was illustrated by the A-rich tail
and it has already been well described in human Alu
sequences [8,9]. This mode of genesis implies the presence of a pre-existing MS and subsequent modifications
by point mutation and slippage events. It has been suggested that the pre-existing MS could arise from the incorporation of the retrotranscript with an extended
polyadenylated tail, a feature which may also serve to
guide their retroposition in the genome [9]. Although the
pre-existing MS was an adenine tract, this evolved into
more complex structures where we observe certain variability in the repeat motif, mostly centered in A rich MS (A
12.6% and A2–4N 57.8%).

The second mechanism is based on the fact that the polyY region has a nucleotide composition highly biased
towards pyrimidines. It could therefore be defined as a site
with high cryptic simplicity [33], which is a DNA
sequence biased in nucleotide composition and made up
of short sequence motifs that, initially, are not tandemly
repeated. The functional significance of this structure currently remains unknown, but its presence in these elements makes the SINE an important source of MS genesis.
Generation of MSs at this site depends on base substitutions that create a tandemly duplicated motif, and on subsequent slippage mutations to increase the number of
copies. Thus, a few C ↔ T transitions, the most frequent
substitutions, are enough to transform cryptic simplicity
sequences into tandemly repeated DNA. The initial bias in
the base substitution was reflected in the repeat motifs
generated, 73.4% of which were AGs. This tendency for
invariability and the greater number of MSs produced by
the poly-Y region suggest that slippage mutation is active
during the early stages of MS genesis. This MS-generating
mutation process has also been shown in an internal
region of the mini-me elements of Dipterans [13]. The
poly-Y region has also been found to be specific of other
mammalian SINEs, such as rabbit C repeat [34], rodent
DIP [35], bat VES [36], and insectivore TAL, ERI-1 and
ERI-2 [37], showing that the action of the two mechanisms that generate MSs are not exclusive to the tRNA
SINEs.
It is known that different MS motifs, motif classes and
even abundances are not equally represented in species
belonging to different groups [28,38] or even within the
genome of any one particular species [39,40]. These differences are still not well-understood and it has been
hypothesized that they may be caused by species-specific
differences in the DNA synthesis and repair machinery
[41], selection [42], or base composition [43]. Although
tRNA SINEs are not the only source of MSs in carnivore
genomes, these elements could explain part of the differences in the distribution of MSs within a particular
genome due to their high abundance and their preference
for insertion at specific sites – such as around the R bands
[44,45] and clustering or insertion into other mobile
genetic elements [9,26,46]. They could also explain differences among phylogenetically distant species or groups,
since the interspersed repeat families generating MSs may
be lineage specific. Along these lines, our results would
indicate that tRNA SINEs have a significant effect on the
overall distribution of some repeat motifs in carnivores,
especially AG and AAAT repeats.
The strong association between repeat elements and MSs
has been largely used for different purposes, such as: i) to
develop new, codominant multiplex marker technologies
such as S-SAP [47] or inter-AluPCR [48]; ii) to build MS-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/269

enriched libraries by amplifying Sau3AI inserts with a conserved SINE primer and a flanking vector primer [49]; iii)
to discover new SINEs, especially in species for which little
information is available concerning their repeat element
content [50]; and iv) to discover new SINE loci which
could be used to reconstruct phylogenies [51]. In this
study we detected 47 completed SINEs whose flanking
regions are targets for primer design and could be used as
phylogenetic markers.
In spite of these applications, MSs associated with interspersed repeats not only distort estimates of the genomic
distribution of MSs useful for genome mapping [27], but
also entail some methodological disadvantages. Firstly,
genotyping with MSs associated with repeat elements is
very hard. Placing one of the PCR primers within a highly
repeated element might cause weak amplification, high
background and difficulty in locus-specific amplification
[10,27,52]. Moreover, if the primers were designed upand downstream from the repeated element, the expected
large size of the PCR product might cause problems in the
resolution of the amplified products [53]. Our results also
showed that potential instability in MSs associated with
tRNA SINEs was lower than in non-associated MSs. Several studies (e.g. [54-56]) have shown that MS mutation
rate increases with an increasing number of repeat units;
this is considered the single most important factor affecting the mutation rate. The isolation of non-masked MS
clones is therefore advisable on account of their high
potential informative content. It has been argued that
point mutations break up perfect repeats and reduce the
mutation rates of MSs [57]. Since there are not significant
differences in the number of imperfect repeat arrays
among databases, the higher content of short repeat arrays
in MSs associated with tRNA SINE cannot entirely be
attributed to imperfections. Finally, most of the applications involving MSs as genetic markers are based on variations in the length of the PCR product, which is expected
to vary according to single-step changes in the number of
repeats. However, it has been shown that poly-Y is responsible for variation in length in the MS flanking region
within species (López-Giráldez et al., unpublished data).
This is probably due to the fact that cryptically simple
sequences are susceptible to undergo slippage in a similar
manner to MSs, but at lower rates [58]. We also detected a
larger number of clones with multiple MSs in the tRNA
SINE database owing to the presence of poly-Y and A-rich
tail. This may also explain the non-neutral observation of
MS clustering [59]. Both cases mentioned preclude the
basic assumptions of MS mutational models. As a result,
the interpretation of the data obtained from MSs associated with tRNA SINEs may induce erroneous conclusions.
Thus, we propose avoiding the use of MS associated with
interspersed repeats as genetic markers.

not have a typical structure.

Conclusion
In this report we have shown how tRNA SINEs, the most
abundant carnivore and a lineage-specific SINE, are
clearly responsible for generating an important fraction of
carnivore MSs. More specifically, we have demonstrated
that not only the A-rich tails but also an internal region
(poly-Y) of these elements regularly expand into lengthy
MSs via two different mechanisms: the expansion of preexisting tandem repeats and the conversion of sequences
with high cryptic simplicity into tandemly repetitive DNA.
The MS genesis in tRNA-SINEs is not only involved in
complex patterns, such as multiple repeated arrays and
length variation in the flanking regions, and is responsible
for shorter repeat arrays, but may also explain differences
in MS distribution among and within species genomes.
The mechanism we have described in tRNA SINEs may
also be generalized to other interspersed repeats. Based on
the negative effect of the association between MSs and
interspersed repeats, we recommend avoiding the use of
these MSs as genetic markers. We suggest applying computer tools after initial sequencing in order to detect interspersed repeats in MS-containing clones and taking

special attention when designing isolation methods (e.g.,
not using Sau3AI and AG or AAAT probes).

Methods
Construction of a sequence database of MS-containing
clones
We constructed a non-redundant database of clone
sequences of carnivore MSs obtained from GenBank
(Release 146.0). Firstly, we performed an Entrez [60] MS
search limited to Genomic DNA and to carnivores. We
also arbitrary limited our sequences to a minimum length
of 200 bp to ensure the possibility of tRNA SINE detection
and to obtain a reasonably sized dataset of identified MSs
for analysis. We removed clone sequences which were not
obtained following the traditional method of MS isolation – i.e. isolation from partial genomic libraries
(selected for small insert size) or from MS-enriched libraries of the species of interest, and screening several thousands of clones through colony hybridization with repeatcontaining probes [61]. To ensure this, we checked all MS
publications and, for unpublished entries, we asked the
authors to provide information concerning their MS isola-

tion procedures. Secondly, we used the CLEANUP program [62,63] to detect and eliminate duplicated
sequences and to facilitate the identification of different
alleles of the same locus, as well as loci shared among species. Finally, we used the NCBI tool VecScreen [64] to
eliminate possible vector contamination. Sequences
which were reduced to below 200 bp after removing vector fragments were deleted from the database.

repetitive DNA sequences not included in Repbase
Update, the clones in which RepeatMasker did not find
interspersed repeat sequences were analyzed by pairwise
comparisons with the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLAST, [67] downloaded from NCBI BLAST ftp site [68]).
To compare the repeat array content and evaluate the
association between MSs and interspersed repeats, we further subdivided MS-containing clones into three different
databases based on the RepeatMasker output: i) nonmasked clones – i.e. not containing interspersed repeats;
ii) clones masked as tRNALys-derived SINEs; and iii) the
remaining masked clones- i.e. intimately associated with
other interspersed repeats.

Computer screening of the database for clones carrying
interspersed repeats
We used the RepeatMasker program (Smit, Hubley, and
Green, unpublished data; RepeatMasker open-3.0.8 at
[65]) to detect and classify interspersed repeats in the
clone database. To do this, RepeatMasker makes use of
Repbase Update [66] which is a comprehensive database
of repetitive element consensus sequences. We ran
RepeatMasker at low speed using the interspersed repeat
carnivore library as DNA source. In order to find possible

length (L) represented in the database, and 3 × 109 states
for the haploid length of a mammalian genome.
Computer identification and characterization of repeat
arrays
To identify all repeat arrays in the MS-containing clones
following a standard criterion, we used the modified version of the Sputnik program (Abajian, unpublished [69])
used in Morgante, Hanafey, and Powell [14]. We looked
for motifs of 1 to 5 bases repeated at least three times and
with a total length of at least 12 bases. We allowed up to
10% variation between MS and a perfectly repeated motif
of the same length (designated as imperfect and perfect
MSs, respectively). We also considered a compound MS
when two consecutive repeats detected by Sputnik were
separated by no more than three consecutive non-repeat
bases [70]. In all analyses, each repeat array of compound
MSs was treated as an independent unit, unless comparison of compound MSs among databases was performed,
in which case, the whole compound repeat was considered as a single array. Classification of MS sequences was
carried out according to their repeat unit outputted by
Sputnik, including all permutations on both strands (e.g.,
AAG represents the following: AAG, AGA, GAA, CTT, CTC,
and TTC). Thus, the total number of theoretically possible
repeat units is 151. Since two regions of tRNA SINEs have
been associated with MSs [17], we classified the MSs associated with tRNA SINEs into three subtypes whenever possible: i) those which were positioned 3' or 5' from a
transposable element; ii) those which had arisen at an
internal sequence (poly-Y) and thus had transposable element sequences on both flanks; and iii) those which were
part of the A-rich tail (fig. 1).

Statistical analyses
To evaluate the consistency with which repeat motifs were
represented among databases – and to overcome the
problem of low cell counts -, we used a Monte Carlo
approximation (N = 100,000) of Fisher's exact test. If differences were observed, we then used Fisher's exact tests to
compare differences in specific motifs. Significance levels
were adjusted using the standard Bonferroni method to
take into account multiple tests on the same data set. To
compare the length of the repeat array between different
databases, we performed a Mann-Whitney U-test, after
first conducting a normality test. To investigate whether
complex MS structures (e.g., compound and imperfect
MSs) were associated with the presence of interspersed
repeats, we compared the abundance of complex MSs
found in the different databases using Fisher's exact test.
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS v11.0.1
(SPSS Inc.).
