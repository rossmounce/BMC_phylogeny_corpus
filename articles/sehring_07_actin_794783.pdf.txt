Abstract
Background: A Paramecium tetraurelia pilot genome project, the subsequent sequencing of a
Megabase chromosome as well as the Paramecium genome project aimed at gaining insight into the
genome of Paramecium. These cells display a most elaborate membrane trafficking system, with
distinct, predictable pathways in which actin could participate. Previously we had localized actin in
Paramecium; however, none of the efforts so far could proof the occurrence of actin in the cleavage
furrow of a dividing cell, despite the fact that actin is unequivocally involved in cell division. This
gave a first hint that Paramecium may possess actin isoforms with unusual characteristics. The
genome project gave us the chance to search the whole Paramecium genome, and, thus, to identify
and characterize probably all actin isoforms in Paramecium.
Results: The ciliated protozoan, P. tetraurelia, contains an actin multigene family with at least 30
members encoding actin, actin-related and actin-like proteins. They group into twelve subfamilies;
a large subfamily with 10 genes, seven pairs and one trio with > 82% amino acid identity, as well as
three single genes. The different subfamilies are very distinct from each other. In comparison to
actins in other organisms, P. tetraurelia actins are highly divergent, with identities topping 80% and
falling to 30%. We analyzed their structure on nucleotide level regarding the number and position
of introns. On amino acid level, we scanned the sequences for the presence of actin consensus
regions, for amino acids of the intermonomer interface in filaments, for residues contributing to
ATP binding, and for known binding sites for myosin and actin-specific drugs. Several of those
characteristics are lacking in several subfamilies. The divergence of P. tetraurelia actins and actinrelated proteins between different P. tetraurelia subfamilies as well as with sequences of other
organisms is well represented in a phylogenetic tree, where P. tetraurelia sequences only partially
cluster.
Conclusion: Analysis of different features on nucleotide and amino acid level revealed striking
differences in isoforms of actin and actin-related proteins in P. tetraurelia, both within the organism
and in comparison to other organisms. This diversification suggests unprecedented specification in
localization and function within a unicellular eukaryote.

Background
Actin is described as one of the most abundant and highly
conserved proteins in eukaryotic cells. It may be present as
monomeric G-actin or as filamentous F-actin and is
involved in many vital cellular functions such as organelle
transport [1], cell motility (reviewed in [2]), cytokinesis
[3], cytoplasmic streaming in plants [4], in regulating trafficking of membrane proteins like the vacuolar H+-ATPase
[5], in exocytosis [6] and in different steps during endocytosis [7], phagosome/lysosome fusion [8,9] and postGolgi transport [10]. Nuclear actin is involved in transcription (reviewed in [11]). This functional diversification may be accounted for by the molecular
diversification of actin in the ciliated protozoan, Paramecium tetraurelia, where immuno-localization has
revealed numerous sites of actin enrichment [12].
The number of actin genes in a species can widely vary
[13]. Multicellular organisms have several isoforms of
cytoplasmic actin, which are coexpressed in most cell
types and share very similar sequences with each other
[14]. In addition, a range of actin-like (ALP) and actinrelated proteins (ARP) exist, which are conserved across
all eukaryotes [15-17]. ARP functions range from specialized effects on conventional G- and F-actin structures to
structural roles that are apparently independent of actin;
for example, ARP1 is a main component of the dynactin
complex [17]. Actins, ALPs and ARPs define a large family
of homologous proteins, the actin superfamily, which
share the same structural architecture, known as the "actin
fold", and an overall sequence similarity to actin [18]. The
actin fold is functionally characterized as an ATPase
domain with ATP-binding capacity in the presence of
Mg2+ or Ca2+. Monomeric actin binds ATP, which is
hydrolyzed to ADP after incorporation of the actin monomer into a filament. This hydrolysis is important for the
dynamic turnover of actin filaments. Also for several
ARPs, hydrolysis of bound ATP is necessary for their function [19].
A brief look into close relatives of Paramecium shows wide
variability. Although in most eukaryotes actin is encoded
by a multigene family, there are also organisms where
only one single actin gene is described so far, e.g. the parasitic apicomplexans, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium parvum [20,21], i.e. close relatives of ciliates. Several
studies on ciliate actin showed that it is different from that
of other eukaryotes and therefore described as "unconventional" [reviewed in [22]].
In P. tetraurelia, a first characterization of actin on the
molecular level was achieved when Diáz-Ramos et al.
(1998) cloned an actin gene fragment of 1,138 bp, i.e.,
more than 96% of the coding sequence of a standard actin
gene [23]. It was called α-actin as it had the highest

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/82

sequence identity to that form in other organisms.
Sequence data provided by a pilot sequencing project
[24,25], the sequencing of a macronucleic one-megabase
chromosome [26] and a current genome project at Genoscope [27] allowed us to search the P. tetraurelia genome
for further actin genes. We found 30 genes for actin, ARPs
and ALP, which could be grouped in 12 widely diverging
subfamilies, with varying intron numbers and positions,
ATP-, myosin II- and drug-binding sites.

Results
Definition of actin genes and subfamilies
Actin1 subfamily
In order to complete the missing ends of the first published actin gene of P. tetraurelia [23], we took advantage
of an indexed genomic library [27] by using a ~ 1 kb probe
designed from the sequence of this actin gene [Genbank:X94954]. By performing a two step hybridization,
several clones were retrieved and sequenced. One of them,
clone 87M3, corresponds to the incomplete actin
sequence previously published [23]. It contains the entire
actin sequence including the missing 5'- and 3'-ends, but
also 18 nucleotide substitutions (when compared to the
sequence published by Diáz-Ramos et al. [23]) predominantly at the ends of the sequence. This actin gene, actin
1-1 [Genbank:AJ537442], consisting of 1128 bp, encodes
a protein of 375 amino acids (aa), with a calculated
molecular weight of 41,700 (Table 1). We also have
cloned this gene from the cDNA synthesized from the
total RNA of vegetative cells. The coding sequence is interrupted by two short introns that display the characteristics
of P. tetraurelia introns, i.e., they are bordered by 5'-GT
and AG-3' and 21–31 nucleotides long.

By sequencing the other 6 clones, we found two other isoforms, actin1-2 [Genbank:AJ537443] and actin 1-3 [Genbank:AJ537444], which differ from actin1-1 by 4 to 8%
on the nucleotide level (Table 1). However, on the amino
acid level all three actins are identical and they all contain
the two introns at the same position. The presence of all
three genes in a cDNA library indicates that all three isoforms are expressed. For other actin subfamily 1 members,
see below.
Actin2 subfamily
Among the 722 protein encoding genes identified in the
course of the pilot sequencing project of the P. tetraurelia
macronuclear genome we also found a partial sequence
with homology to another mammalian actin. Sequencing
of the corresponding clone, M07D05u, resulted in the
identification of the 5'- end of this gene. To obtain the
missing 3'- end, we took advantage of the indexed
genomic library [28], which we analyzed in two sequential hybridization steps by using a specific probe designed
from sequence M07D05u. Among nine clones, 5 con-

tained the complete sequence information of this gene
and 4 that of a closely related actin isoform. The two genes
were called actin2-1 [Genbank:AJ537446] and actin2-2
[Genbank:AJ537447]. Sequencing from a Paramecium
cDNA-library revealed the cDNA information of the corresponding genes. The ORFs, which are interrupted by 5
short introns, encode proteins of 376 amino acids with a
calculated molecular mass of 42.4 kDa (Table 1).

Other actin subfamilies
During early steps of the P. tetraurelia whole genome shotgun sequencing undertaken by Genoscope, and by manual assembly of single reads extracted from the draft
assembly we used, we were able to identify further actin
coding genes, resulting in a total number of 30 genes
encoding actins, ARPs and ALP. They can be classified into
12 subfamilies, according to their sequence identity, their

length, and the number of introns as well as their position.
Interestingly, the megabase chromosome sequencing
project [25] revealed a cluster of three actin genes
(scaffold1; accession number CR548612; actin1-6, actin32 and actin8-1). On the related sister scaffold (scaffold 8)
only two actins were present (actin1-7, accession number
CR855973, and actin3-1, accession number AJ537448).
The incidence of two closely related isoforms is probably
due to recent whole genome duplication in P. tetraurelia
(J. Cohen and L. Sperling, personal communication;
[29]).
General features of Paramecium actin sequences
Based on an alignment of all 30 actin-related genes found
in P. tetraurelia (ClustalW alignment, see additional file
1), they can be divided into twelve subfamilies (Table 1):
seven pairs, one trio, three single genes, and a large subfamily with 10 members, one of which seems to be a pseudogene (see below). Within a subfamily, proteins are of
equal size. Exceptions are the members of the largest subfamily 1 which vary between 370 and 376 amino acids.
While several P. tetraurelia actin genes encode proteins
with the common actin length of 375 aa, there are also
some smaller (down to 332 aa) and some larger ones (up
to 394 aa). Both ARP2 and ARP3 isoforms, with 391 aa
and 426 aa, respectively, are in the range of the usual
length for those proteins. Additionally one gene encodes
a large actin-like protein with 658 aa (Table 1). Amplification with gene-specific primers (see additional file 2)
from P. tetraurelia cDNA indicates the expression of
selected isoforms and reveals cDNA information about
these genes. In detail, comparison of these sequences with
the genomic version allows us to determine number, size
and position of the introns. The number and positions of
introns varies between the different subfamilies, while
they are identical within a subfamily (Fig. 1). An exception is again subfamily 1, where six members possess two
introns, while two members contain only one, and two
members none. In subfamily 3, the two members do not
contain any introns. Subfamily 5, where the open reading
frame (ORF) is interrupted by six introns, has the highest
number of introns (Fig. 1, Table 1). For actin1-10, resequencing from cDNA confirms that within this part of
the SuperContig sequence a conserved 26 bp-intron contains an unusual 3' border ('ttg' instead of a 'tag') and
therefore cannot be spliced. As a consequence a frame
shift occurs, causing a termination signal and a truncated
protein (103 aa).

Members within a subfamily share more than 80%
sequence identity at the nucleotide level (Table 1; alignment with Clustal W). Exceptions are the members of subfamily 1 whose amino acid composition varies by up to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/82

34%. The different actin subfamilies are highly divergent
from each other. Comparing the amino acid sequence of
all of them to actin1-1, the isoforms of the actin2 subfamily have the highest identity with less than 60%. Members of other subfamilies have less than 50% identity, with
the most diverse isoform, actin9-1, sharing only 17.6%
identity. Actin1-1 was chosen as reference sequence as it
is, together with the identical (on amino acid level) isoforms actin1-2 and actin1-3, the most conserved actin in
comparison to actins from other organisms (Table 2).
Nevertheless, even these isoforms share less than 80%
identity with actins of selected model organisms. This
wide diversification of P. tetraurelia actins is manifested in
the differences found in several functional characteristics,
as shown below.
Actin-related proteins (ARPs)
For some P. tetraurelia actin isoforms, NCBI Blast searches
leads to hits for both actins and ARPs of other organisms.
Therefore, we additionally used ARPAnno, an actinrelated protein annotation server designed by Muller et al.
[18], for classification of our sequences. In general, the
results from NCBI Blast search and ARPAnno concur, only
in two cases different classifications were obtained (see
below). According to ARPAnno results, actin5 might be
classified as ARP1 (score: 47.5; score for actin: 44.0; score
ranging from 0 to 100). For ARP1, three isoforms (actin51, actin5-2 and actin5-3) exist, while both ARP2 and ARP3
are represented by two isoforms. The nuclear ARPs, ARP4
and ARP6, which are copresent in certain chromatin
remodeling complexes, are omnipresent in eukaryotic
organisms, except for the parasitic protozoan, Encephalitozoon cuniculi [18]. Similarly, in the P. tetraurelia genome,
we only found putative orthologs for ARP4 (actin7) but
none for ARP6. The designation as ARP4 is due to blast
search hits for ARP4 from the NCBI database. In contrast,
alignment with ARPAnno gave the best score for ARP2
(29.1), but the score for ARP4 is just slightly lower (28.8),
just as the score for actin (27.0). For the single ALP found
in the Paramecium database, NCBI blast search showed
also hits with nuclear ARP5, which is supported by a best
ARPAnno score for ARP5 (28.7; score for actin: 26.3). For
nuclear ARP8, we could not find any ortholog. The functionally obligate heterodimeric partners ARP7 and ARP9,
the two ARPs restricted to fungi so far [18], are not
present. Actin9, the most divergent isoform in P. tetraurelia, is difficult to classify due to different results obtained
with BlastP searches and ARPAnno alignments (actin/
ARP10 and ARP2 (score: 24.8)/orphans [sequences lacking common defining characteristics, score: 24.8; score for
actin: 23.2], respectively).
Phylogenetic distribution
The growing number of sequence data from different
organisms available allows us to investigate the phyloge-

netic distribution of P. tetraurelia actins and actin-related
proteins (Fig. 2). A phylogenetic tree with all actins and
ARPs of a set of sequenced genomes (P. tetraurelia, H. sapiens, D. melanogaster and S. cerevisiae) was created (Fig. 2)
using PhyloDraw [30], (matrix: neighbor joining). For a
clear arrangement, we have selected one member of each
P. tetraurelia subfamily; an exception is subfamily one,
where only the isoforms actin1-2 and 1-3 were excluded,
as they are identical to actin1-1 at amino acid level. The
first members of subfamily 1 cluster in one branch, while
actin1-8 and 1-9 group together in another branch. Subfamilies 3 and 8 build a similar small branch, while subfamily 2, 6 and 7 are single-standing. None of them
cluster together with any sequence from other organisms.
However, P. tetraurelia ARP3 clusters with ARP3 from
other organisms, as does ARP2. Likewise, P. tetraurelia
actin5, actin9 and ALP1 sequences, which all could be
classified as ARPs (ARP1, ARP2/10 and ARP5, respectively), cluster in branches with the respective ARP
sequences from the other organisms. The high diversity of
actin genes even within protozoa is indicated in a phylogenetic tree composed of actin and ARP sequences from
13 different protozoa (see additional file 3). The overall
distribution of P. tetraurelia sequences in both trees is similar. However, with an expanded tree, using 71 sequences
from 26 organisms, the clustering of possible P. tetraurelia
ARPs with ARPs from other organisms is clearly reduced
(see additional file 4). This observation was verified by a
phylogenetic tree with 40 additional sequences, which
resulted in the same isolated branches for P. tetraurelia
sequences (data not shown).

Actin consensus pattern
PROSITE [31] has developed three signature patterns
which detect most of the sequences known to belong to
actin. Two of them (ACTINS_1, [FY]- [LIV]-G- [DE]-E-AQ-x- [RKQ](2)-G, position 54 to 64, and ACTINS_2, W[IV]- [STA]- [RK]-x- [DE]-Y- [DNE]- [DE], position 357 to
365) are specific for actins, while one signature
(ACTINS_3, [LM]- [LIVM]-T-E- [GAPQ]-x- [LIVMFYWHQ]-N- [STAQ]-x(29-N- [KR], position 106 to 118)
selects actins, ARPs and ALPs. Most actin subfamilies,
namely 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, the ARPs and ALP, do not possess
any actin consensus pattern (Fig. 3). Actin signatures are
mainly present in the actin1 subfamily, where every isoform has at least one consensus pattern, but only the isoforms actin1-1 to actin1-5 have all three of them. The
ACTINS_1 and ACTINS_3 signatures are restricted to the
actin1 subfamily. The ACTINS_2 signature is the most
common, with an expression in nearly all isoforms of the
actin1 subfamily (except for actin1-6), in the actin3 subfamily and in actin8-1.
Amino acids influencing polymerization
Several specific amino acids were proven to be involved in
subunit interaction across the actin filament. An intermolecular coupling of the DNase I binding loop (residues
38–52) and the C terminus [32], and of the hydrophobic
plug (residues 262–274) and the C terminus [33] has
been suggested. Examples of intermonomer cross-linking
of F-actin are the residue pairs H40/E167, Q41/C374,
S265/C374, and Q41/C265 [34,35]. We aligned the P.
tetraurelia actin sequences with a number of actins from
other organisms (including those in Table 2, and in addition, another H. sapiens actin sequence [Gen-

Characteristic features of P. tetraurelia actins, ARPs and ALP. Characteristic features include consensus and drug
binding motifs. These are identical within subfamilies wherefore only one isoform of each is shown as an example. The actin
signatures (green) are based on the three actin consensus patterns according to PROSITE: ACTINS_1, [FY]-[LIV]-G-[DE]-E-AQ-x-[RKQ](2)-G; ACTINS_2, W-[IV]-[STA]-[RK]-x-[DE]-Y-[DNE]-[DE] and ACTINS_3, [LM]-[LIVM]-T-E-[GAPQ]-x-[LIVMFYWHQ]-N-[STAQ]-x(29-N-[KR]. Not all isoforms contain the typical consensus pattern found in most of the actin genes
described in other species. Also the three residues mediating the binding of phalloidin (G158, R177 and D179) are not present
in every subfamily (red). The same is true for the residues (blue) relevant for the binding of latrunculin A (D157, R183, D184,
R210, D211, K213, E214 and K215).

bank:CAG38753] and a P. falciparum sequence
[Genbank:PFL2215w]) and checked for the presence of
the above-mentioned residues. Most isoforms do not possess a pair of interacting amino acids (Table 3). Only in
subfamily 1 we could find such pairs. This is mainly due
to the lack of the residues in the DNase I binding loop,
H40 and Q41, respectively, in all other subfamilies. In
most subfamilies, the amino acid conservation in the
DNase I binding loop is generally weak (data not shown).
The same holds true for the hydrophobic plug. The amino
acid S265, which interacts intermolecularly with two residues, is only present in actin1-8.
ATP binding
Both actin and ARPs bind ATP. The hydrolysis of ATP to
ADP is proposed to induce a conformational change
required for their biological function [19,36]. The conservation of 17 key reference residues involved in nucleotide
binding was analyzed (Fig. 4). The isoforms can be clustered in three groups. The first group is composed of
actin1-1 to actin1-8, the subfamily actin2, actin5-1,
actin5-2, and the ARP subfamilies 2 and 3, all possessing
> 60% conserved residues. The second group, composed
of actin1-9, the subfamilies actin3, actin5-3, actin6, and
actin8, has 40–60% conserved residues. The third group
displays a very low level of conserved residues with less
than 30% (subfamilies actin4, actin7 and actin9).
Binding residues for myosin II
Actin binds a substantial number of proteins collectively
called actin-binding proteins (ABP). One of the best studied is myosin II. We looked for the expression of myosin
II binding residues [37] in P. tetraurelia (Fig. 5). The binding site is well conserved in subfamilies 1 (except act1-8),
2 and 4. In several members of subfamily one, all residues
are present. Most of the other subfamilies show at least
40% identity, only in some actin/ARP subfamilies the
conservation is weak.
Drug binding residues
Several drugs can interact with actin where they interfere
with polymerization and depolymerization. Phalloidin
binds to actin filaments and stabilizes them against depolymerization [38]. Using fluorescently labeled phalloidin
is a common approach to visualize actin filaments. Since
mutagenesis studies have identified drug binding sites, we
had a closer look at phalloidin binding sites. As such,
G158, R177 and D179 have been suggested [39,40].
Using the multiple sequence alignment of actins, we
found that only six actin isoforms possess all three of
these amino acids (Table 4, Fig. 3). While G158 is highly
conserved and exists in all isoforms, the other two residues are lacking in many subfamilies.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/82

Latrunculin is another actin binding drug for which mutagenesis studies revealed the binding residues. This drug
sequesters actin monomers by making 1:1 complexes
[41]. In yeast mutagenesis studies, three mutated alleles
(act1-112: K213, E214, K215; act1-113: R210, D211; act1117: R183, D184) lead to a complete resistance to latrunculin A [42]. Analysis of P. tetraurelia actin sequences
showed that the residues for latrunculin A binding are
mainly present in the actin1 subfamily, but no isoform
possesses all of them (Table 4, Fig. 3). Only sporadic binding residues can be found in the other subfamilies, and
none in actin subfamilies 3, 7 and 8. Amino acid D157,
which has also been implicated in the binding of latrunculin A [40], is not present in any of the P. tetraurelia actins
(Table 4).

Discussion
Extensive Paramecium database searches and analyses
allowed us to identify 30 genes in Paramecium as actins,
actin-related proteins or actin-like proteins, according to
NCBI Blast hits. They cluster in 12 subfamilies with varying intron positions and numbers, which range from zero
to six (Table 1). Genes encoding actin have been cloned
also in several other protists [43], including apicomplexans [44], which, together with ciliates such as Paramecium
and Tetrahymena, belong to the phylum Alveolata. In
Cryptosporidium, the actin gene is intronless, and in Toxoplasma it has one intron. In Plasmodium falciparum,
another Apicomplexan, there are two genes encoding
actin [44]. One gene (actin I) is intronless and is expressed
throughout the parasite life cycle, while the actin II gene
has one intron and is transcribed only in the sexual stages.
Identification of ARPs and ALPs
The amino acid sequence variation between the different
P. tetraurelia actin subfamilies is very high. When compared to actin1-1, which is most similar to conventional
actins, most of them show less than 50% identity. In the
literature, ARPs share between 17 and 60% amino acid
identity with conventional actins [16]. Due to contradictory hits with blast searches in the database, some P.
tetraurelia subfamilies could be assigned to both, actins or
ARPs. Most "double-hits" are confirmed by alignments
with ARPAnno. However, the scores obtained with
ARPAnno for their respective ARP classification were
below the value which was determined as highly reliable
by the designers (score > 55), and only slightly higher
than the scores for actin. Therefore, their assignment to an
established ARP family is critical and we rely on the NCBI
Blast search results for their classification. Hence, the
respective proteins are annotated as actins in the Paramecium database, with the indication ARP in brackets.

From the eleven ARP subfamilies described in the NCBI
database, six have presumably orthologs in P. tetraurelia.

G304, T305, M307, Y308, and K338) known to participate in
ATP binding to actin. For subfamilies in which the conservation pattern is identical for all members, only one is shown.

The lack of several subfamilies is not unexpected as some
of them are restricted to, or absent from different phyla
[18]. ARP1 (also called centractin), a major component of
the dynactin complex, is present in a wide range of organisms, from yeast to humans, but absent from Arabidopsis,
rice and possibly from other plants [18]. Yeast has a single
ARP1 gene, whereas higher eukaryotes have at least two or
perhaps three isoforms [16]. In P. tetraurelia, the three
members of the actin5 subfamily might be orthologs of
ARP1. They match the general length of ARP1 in vertebrates (376 aa), but they are less identical to conventional
actins than in general (~ 40% in comparison to 55–60%
[45]).
Besides ARP1, a second actin-related protein is found in
the dynactin complex – ARP10 (yeast) or ARP11 (fly and
vertebrates). According to NCBI database blast, actin9
could be an ortholog of ARP10. However, ARPAnno alignment resulted in an equally low score for ARP2 and
orphans, which makes an accurate classification difficult.
ARP2 and ARP3 form the ARP2/3 complex, which is a
major nucleator of actin polymerization [46]. Both ARPs
are present in P. tetraurelia, while they are both absent
from apicomplexans [47]. Additionally we found
sequences which are presumably orthologs of the nuclear
ARP4 (actin7) and ARP5 (ALP1). Admittedly, the classification of actin7 as ARP4 according to NCBI blast search

might be critical, as ARPAnno gave a slightly better score
for ARP2. Both, ARP4 and ARP5, are thought to be copresent in chromatin remodeling complexes with some other
ARPs. Surprisingly we could not find orthologs of the
respective partners (ARP6 and ARP8) in the database.
ARP4 and ARP6 are the most conserved ARPs regarding
the distribution among the eukaryotic phyla, while both
ARP5 and ARP8 are absent from several organisms [18]. It
would be interesting to determine if the lack of these ARPs
correlates with a lack of the corresponding complementary subunit, or if their functions are fulfilled by other proteins. However, despite extensive search in the fully
covered Paramecium database, we cannot definitely
exclude that potential genes may have escaped our data
mining approach. This could be due to high evolution
rates and/or disruption by many or unconventional
introns.
Actin isoforms
The high number of actin and ARP sequences in P. tetraurelia seems to be quite unusual for a unicellular organism.
While for several multicellular organisms, an exorbitant
number of actin genes was reported (for example, the
flowering plant Petunia was shown to have over 100 actin
genes [48]), the situation in protists seems to be rather different. Several genome projects (Leishmania major, Plasmodium berghei, Plasmodium falciparum, Trypanosoma brucei
and Tetrahymena thermophila) revealed only about 10
sequences related to the actin superfamily. However, in
the slime mold, Dictyostelium discoideum, also over 30
genes for actin and ARPs have been found [49].

Several possible reasons were discussed why organisms
have multiple actin isoforms [50]. One argument is that,
as actin plays a role in many cellular processes, organisms
need a large quantity of actin, and the best way to provide
enough actin may be to have multiple genes. In fact, in P.
tetraurelia, we found three isoforms which are identical on
amino acid level (actin1-1, 1-2 and 1-3), and they are all
expressed. While their existence could be explained with
genome duplications in P. tetraurelia [29], the expression
of all three of them might be a tool for gene amplification.
A related explanation is derived from the fact that, in Drosophila, two cytoplasmic actin genes show a differential
temporal and spatial expression [51]. Finally, amino acid
difference may be important, allowing the different isoforms to exert different roles in the same cell. The high
degree of divergence observed in P. tetraurelia actins might
be a hint to the last hypothesis. This may be exceptional
for an exceptionally complex cell. In contrast, in the
model plant Arabidopsis, there are eight actin genes, which
can be divided into vegetative and reproductive classes,
and are expressed in a tissue-specific manner [52]. The
spectrum of actin proteins may reflect the mixture of actin
functions and/or patterns of regulation in different plant

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/82

organs [48]. But also within a single cell, specialized function could be observed. For instance, within muscle cells,
muscle actins may be preferentially utilized for the formation of myofibrils, whereas cytoplasmic actin isoforms
may be used exclusively for some cytoskeletal functions
not related to contraction [52]. Several studies in other
systems also suggest that different isoforms do have specialized functions [14]. This may also be assumed for the
numerous isoforms we find in P. tetraurelia, considering
the multiple localization sites [12,53].
Another interesting point is the possible redundancy of
various isoforms. Assuming that the different subfamilies
have indeed different functions, could one isoform nevertheless compensate the loss of another? In Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii, the loss of the conventional actin is compensated by enhanced expression of a highly divergent actin
called "novel actin-like protein" (NAP), which is only negligibly expressed in stationary wild type cells [54].
Phylogenetic distribution
The diversity of P. tetraurelia actins and ARPs is well represented in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2). While the different
actin isoforms of H. sapiens and D. melanogaster, respectively, build defined branches, most P. tetraurelia actins
are isolated and scattered throughout the tree. They do
hardly cluster with actins from other organisms, not even
with those from other ciliates and protozoa (see additional file 3). Exceptions are ARP sequences and
sequences with uncertain assignments. Some of them
cluster in branches with the corresponding ARP sequences
from the other organisms, which emphasize their classification as such. However, apparently unambiguous assignments of those sequences are nevertheless critical due to
the above mentioned problems. Also, in an expanded tree
using 71 sequences from 26 organisms, the clustering of
possible ARPs with ARPs from other organisms is reduced
(see additional file 4). The findings agree with the diversity within ciliate actins recently reported from other species by Kim et al. [55]. Similarly, ARPs from
apicomplexans do not group with any of the known ARP
clades [47], although they are considered closely related
to ciliates.
Actin consensus pattern
Most P. tetraurelia actins do not contain any of the three
actin signatures (Fig. 3), and only five isoforms (actin1-1
to actin1-5) do possess all three. Neither ARPs nor ALP
possess the actin consensus pattern which usually serves
to detect them. One should keep in mind that these patterns detect most, but not all, actins, ARPs and ALPs in the
database. There are a number of known false negative hits
when these patterns are used in PROSITE search [31]. The
lack of any actin consensus pattern in most of the P. tetrau-

relia isoforms again illustrates the highly divergent character of actins and ARPs in this organism.
Amino acids influencing polymerization
Several amino acids of the DNase I binding loop, the
hydrophobic plug and the C-terminus region are involved
in the intermolecular interaction across the actin filament
[32,33]. In P. tetraurelia actin subfamilies, many of them
are lacking (Table 3). This is especially true of the residues
in the DNase I binding loop and the hydrophobic plug,
which in Paramecium are generally not well conserved.
Among Spirotricha (ciliates), these regions are segments
of increased nonconservative sequence variations [56].
The alteration of the residues H40 and Q41 in the DNase
I binding loop may affect filament formation [57]. Both
residues are best conserved in subfamily 1, together with
the corresponding partners. Concomitantly, immunolocalization with antibodies raised against subfamily 1
showed occurrence of several polymeric structures [12].
Moreover, as the antibodies were designed at a time where
not all isoforms had yet been found, it might well be that
they also recognize members of subfamily 2 and subfamily 3 (~ 60% and ~ 50% identity in the regions selected
for antibody production).

Residues mediating binding between adjacent monomers
are also largely altered in several apicomplexans, thus providing an explanation of the absence of stable, long filaments in these parasites [57,58], apart from sequestration
of monomers and capping filaments by ABPs [59]. The

absence of residues involved in intermonomer contact
does not necessarily mean that these isoforms are not able
to polymerize. One should keep in mind that the analysis
was based only on certain primary structures. It is still possible that, due to the different length of the isoforms, relevant amino acids may match in the respective overall
structures with the adjacent monomer. Indeed localization studies with ABs against actin4-1 showed polymerized actin in Paramecium cells [53]. Moreover, recall that
for several P. tetraurelia sequences an explicit classification
as actin or ARP is not possible. ARP1 would be the only
ARP able to form a homopolymer filament in vivo in
other eukaryotes [60].
ATP binding
Binding and hydrolysis of ATP is important for the function of actin and several ARPs [19,36]. In most actin subfamilies, the nucleotide binding capacity is well conserved
(Fig. 4), probably allowing binding and subsequent
hydrolyzing of ATP, thus allowing for actin turnover in filaments. The identities of binding residues in the different
ARP subfamilies in P. tetraurelia are in accordance with the
conservation pattern of the respective ARP subfamilies
shown in a comparative analysis (Fig. 4; [17]). The lowest
residue identity was observed in actin subfamily 7, which
also matches as ARP4. Indeed, a recent report suggests
that, in yeast, ATP binds weakly to ARP4 [61]. It remains
open whether actins/ARPs with a restricted number of
conserved residues are able to bind ATP, though with
lower affinity, or whether other residues are involved.

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:82

Interestingly, ATP binding may not be important for
nuclear ARPs, as several studies have shown that mutation
in nucleotide contact residues of several ARPs did not
impair their function [62,63].

centrations. Therefore, transferring tools commonly used
in other systems to P. tetraurelia, may be problematic
because the drug cannot bind to the responsible isoform.

Conclusion
Binding residues for myosin II
Regarding the variety and diversity of P. tetraurelia actin
isoforms, the question arises whether differences in actin
isoform structure determine which ABPs can bind.
According to automatic annotations performed with the
Paramecium database, myosin II is present in the Paramecium genome [27]. The myosin II binding site is quite
differentially conserved across P. tetraurelia subfamilies
(Fig. 5). Most subfamilies show conservation between 40
to 60%. The possibility of those isoforms to bind myosin
II with either lower affinity or via other residues needs to
be clarified. The lowest conservation could be observed in
orthologs designated as actin/ARP and ARPs, respectively,
which are not supposed to bind myosin II. Several members of subfamily 1 possess all of the necessary residues.
Immuno-localization studies with antibodies raised
against actin subfamily 1 showed cortical actin in P.
tetraurelia [12], both on the light and electron microscopic
level. Similar results were obtained using fluorescent phalloidin and heavy meromyosin [64]. The interaction of
cortical actin with myosin is essential for cyclosis, an actomyosin-based process, also in Paramecium.
Drug binding residues
Surprisingly, for cytochalasins, some of the most common
drugs used to influence the dynamics of actin, we could
not find any data on putative binding residues. However,
for the filament stabilizing drug phalloidin and for the
monomer sequestering drug latrunculin A, several studies
revealed specific amino acids involved in their binding
[39-41]. Jasplakinolide, another potent inducer of actin
polymerization, binds actin filaments competitively with
phalloidin, presumably due to common binding sites
[65]. In Paramecium, the binding residues for phalloidin
[39,40] are only well conserved in several members of the
actin1subfamily (Table 4, Fig. 3). Concomitantly, microinjection of fluorescent phalloidin in P. tetraurelia resulted
in a distinct labeling pattern [60], which was consistent
with localization studies with antibodies against subfamily 1 [12]. However, no staining of the cleavage furrow
could ever be achieved, although actin is unequivocally
involved in cell division. Indeed, immuno-localization
studies with an isoform-specific antibody against actin4, a
subfamily lacking the phalloidin binding site, resulted in
the labeling of the cleavage furrow [53].

The situation is similar for latrunculin A, where no isoform possesses all binding residues (Table 4, Fig. 3), suggesting low drug binding affinities. In fact, many studies
with Paramecium had to apply unusually high drug con-

Analysis of all the different features of actin and ARPs in
P. tetraurelia, on nucleotide and amino acid levels,
revealed exceptional differences in comparison to actins
and ARPs from other organisms. Also within this organism, members of several subfamilies are considerably different. The basis of this differentiation is likely gene
duplication, including a very recent one [29]. This may
also explain the occurrence of some silent mutations
(with identical derived amino acid sequences) as well as
the occurrence, on average, of two very similar members
per subfamily. The wide diversification may be reflected
by different functions and localization of the actin and
ARP subfamily members within a Paramecium cell.

Methods
Stocks and cultures
The wild-type strains of P. tetraurelia used were stock
strains 7S and d4-2, derived from stock strain 51S [66].
Cells were cultivated in a decoction of dried lettuce monoxenically inoculated with Enterobacter aerogenes, and supplemented with 0.4 μg· ml-1 β-sitosterol [67].
PCR of genomic DNA and cDNA
Total wild-type DNA from strain 7S for PCR was prepared
from log-phase cultures as published by Godiska et al.
[68]. The ORFs of individual actin genes were amplified
by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR using total RNA prepared according to Haynes et al. [69]. RT-PCR was performed in a programmable thermocycler T3 (Biometra,
Göttingen, Germany) using 3'-oligo dTT primer and the
SuperScript™ III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) for first-strand cDNA synthesis. 3'-oligo
dTT primer containing the artificial restriction sites EcoRI/
NotI
was:
5'-AACTGGAAGAATTCGCGGCCGCGGAATTTTTTTTTTTTTT-3'. The subsequent PCR reaction
(50 μl) was performed with the Advantage 2 cDNA
polymerase mix (Clontech, Palo Alto, California) using
actin specific oligonucleotides (see additional file 2: oligonucleotides used to study gene expression) with or
without the artificial restriction sites XhoI, HindIII or StuI
added at their 5'-ends. In general, amplifications were performed with one cycle of denaturation (95°C, 1 min),
40–42 cycles of denaturation (95°C, 30 s), annealing
(54–58°C, 45 s) and extension (68°C, 3 min), followed
by a final extension step at 68°C for 5 min. PCR products
were subcloned into the plasmid pCR2.1 by using the
TOPO-TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transformation into E. coli
(DH5 cells or TOP10F' cells), positive clones were
sequenced as described below.

Hybridization cloning
Hybridization cloning from an indexed library of Paramecium macronuclear DNA [28] was carried out as
described previously [70]. For the first published actin
gene of P. tetraurelia [23], 27 positive spots were detected
on type 1 filters, seven of which were also analyzed in
detail on type 2 filters and sequenced (47F1, 55B19,
87M3, 96J10, 107D11, 139C10, and 149A2 [internal designations; 28]). For another actin gene, named actin2, 10
positive spots were detected on type 1 filters, which were
analyzed in detail on type 2 filters (M07D05u, 15M16,
27N16, 27P11, 27P12, 47j22, 74C9, 87H1, 87J8, 93E10,
and 134L2).
Annotation and characterization of actin genes
In order to identify further actin genes in Paramecium, the
developing Paramecium database [71] was screened by
using the nucleotide and amino acid sequence of already
identified and annotated Paramecium actin genes. Positive
hits were further analyzed by performing BLAST searches
with GenBank at the NCBI database [72]. Additional classification was performed using ARPAnno, an actin-related
protein annotation server [18]. Conserved motif searches
were performed with either PROSITE [31], or with BLASTRPS using pfam entries of the corresponding CDD database [73,74]. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary
analyses were performed with either Clustal W and PhyloDraw (version 0.8; Department of Computer Science,
Putan National University, Korea [30], or the Mega version 3 program [75].
