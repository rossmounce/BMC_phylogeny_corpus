Abstract
Background: Several lines of evidence suggest that codon usage in the Drosophila saltans and D.
willistoni lineages has shifted towards a less frequent use of GC-ending codons. Introns in these
lineages show a parallel shift toward a lower GC content. These patterns have been alternatively
ascribed to either a shift in mutational patterns or changes in the definition of preferred and
unpreferred codons in these lineages.
Results and discussion: To gain additional insight into this question, we quantified background
substitutional patterns in the saltans/willistoni group using inactive copies of a novel, Q-like
retrotransposable element. We demonstrate that the pattern of background substitutions in the
saltans/willistoni lineage has shifted to a significant degree, primarily due to changes in mutational
biases. These differences predict a lower equilibrium GC content in the genomes of the saltans/
willistoni species compared with that in the D. melanogaster species group. The magnitude of the
difference can readily account for changes in intronic GC content, but it appears insufficient to
explain changes in codon usage within the saltans/willistoni lineage.
Conclusion: We suggest that the observed changes in codon usage in the saltans/willistoni clade
reflects either lineage-specific changes in the definitions of preferred and unpreferred codons, or a
weaker selective pressure on codon bias in this lineage.

Background
Codon bias refers to the unequal usage of synonymous
codons in protein coding sequences. Preferred codons are
believed to correspond to more abundant transfer
(t)RNAs [1]. In genes with high codon bias, the frequent
presence of preferred codons is believed to increase the
efficiency and/or fidelity of translation [2-4]. In Drosophila, empirical evidence suggests that the degree of
codon bias can have substantial effects on active protein

level; replacements of preferred codons with unpreferred
ones in the alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) gene result in significant decreases in levels of protein activity [5].
Within the genome of a particular species, the level of
codon bias for any given gene is thought to be governed
by the dynamic interplay among natural selection, mutation, and drift. Accordingly, codon bias levels will be
affected by the rate and dominance of mutations affecting

codon bias, the stochasticity associated with the population processes affecting these mutations (mediated
through factors such as effective population size and
recombination rate), and the strength of natural selection
on codon bias. Variation in codon usage within a single
genome is often associated with variation in one or more
of these factors. In Drosophila melanogaster, for instance,
codon bias is positively correlated with gene expression,
which is thought to reflect increased selective benefits of
translational efficiency for highly expressed genes [6-8].
Likewise, the negative correlation between codon bias and
protein length in this species may result from Hill-Robertson effects [9], or may occur because increases in codon
bias have stronger effects in short genes than in long genes
[7,10-12]. The increase in codon bias associated with
increased recombination rate in D. melanogaster is likely
due to a recombination-associated substitutional bias
[13-15], but Hill-Robertson effects may also play a role
[16-18].
The genome hypothesis [19] suggests that the definition
of "preferred" and "unpreferred" codons is the same for
all genes in the genome, as codon preferences likely reflect
tRNA abundances. Changes in codon usage patterns
between species may be due to the same forces that modulate codon bias within any particular genome, but may
also result from shifts in the definitions of preferred and
unpreferred codons. Such shifts are not very common in
evolution, and are generally observed only among very
distantly related organisms. Within Drosophila, for
instance, D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura, which
diverged 25–40 million years ago (MYA) [20], have nearly
identical definitions of major and minor codons [21].
In contrast, species in the D. saltans/willistoni lineages,
which diverged from D. melanogaster around 30–40 MYA
[20], show a substantially different pattern of codon usage
from that found in the melanogaster and obscura group species. The saltans/willistoni lineages diverged from D. melanogaster prior to the split of the melanogaster and obscura
groups but after the split of the Drosophila and Sophophora
subgenera (Figure 1). Phylogenetic analysis [22] suggests
that species within the melanogaster and obscura groups
show roughly the ancestral pattern of codon usage, while
there has been a significant reduction in the usage of G- or
C-ending codons in the common ancestor of the saltans
and willistoni lineages. In these species, the reduction of
GC content is evident not only at third codon positions
but also, albeit to a lesser extent, in introns and at first
codon positions [22-26].
One hypothesis for the pronounced change in GC content
in coding sequences is that the definitions of preferred
and unpreferred codons have changed in the saltans/willistoni group [27]. This hypothesis is supported by the obser-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/37

vation that some amino acids show a greater change in GC
content than do others [27]. However, a change in codon
preferences cannot be invoked to explain the change in
base composition of noncoding sequences.
One explanation for the concomitant shifts in GC content
of codon and noncoding sequences is a genome-wide
shift in the pattern of background substitutions [15] in
favor of lower GC content in the saltans/willistoni group
[22,25,28]. Such a shift could arise from either a change
in mutational patterns or an increased rate of fixation of
As and Ts mediated by biased gene conversion or natural
selection. However, it is difficult to reconcile a simple substitutional model with the observed heterogeneity of
change in GC content among amino acids.
To help distinguish between these two competing hypotheses, we investigated background patterns of nucleotide
substitution in nine species belonging to the saltans/willistoni clade. We inferred these patterns by investigating rates
of nucleotide substitution in nonfunctional fragments of
a novel Q-like retrotransposable element. Our results suggest a minor shift in the spectrum of background nucleotide substitution in saltans/willistoni group relative to that
found in D. melanogaster. The magnitude of this shift to is
sufficient to generate a reduction of 11.5% at most in the
GC content in the saltans/willistoni group. This is consistent with the reduction in GC content of intronic
sequences in this lineage, but contrasts with the observed
reduction in GC content of coding sequences of ~30%.
Consequently, we suggest that the change in noncoding
GC content in the saltans/willistoni group may result from
background substitutional patterns, whereas the change
in GC content of coding sequences reflects either novel
codon preferences or a weakening of selection on codon
bias.

Results
Identification of Q-saltans1
We isolated a novel retrotransposable element in the D.
saltans genome using degenerate PCR. This element
showed highest homology with a Q element originally
found in the Anopheles gambiae genome [29], and accordingly, we named this novel retrotranspon Q-saltans1.
Using PCR primers specific to Q-saltans1, we identified a
total of 58 paralogous copies of Q-saltans1 from individual flies from nine species in the saltans and willistoni species groups. Evolutionary relationships among the nine
species studied are presented in Figure 1[28]. Ten copies
of Q-saltans1 were isolated from D. saltans, six from D. prosaltans, seven from D. subsaltans, seven from D. neocordata,
eight from D. emarginata, five from D. tropicalis, five from
D. equinoxialis, five from D. paulistorum and five from D.
willistoni.

the saltans and willistoni groups diverged approximately 20 MYA [27]
Phylogenetic reconstruction in D. saltans
We built a phylogenetic tree using parsimony criteria to
reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among the 58
paralogs of Q-saltans1 (Figure 2). We mapped all 515
unambiguous changes to individual branches of the phylogeny. Changes mapping to the internal branches of the
phylogeny are shared among elements, which suggests
that they correspond to the constrained evolution of the
active lineages of Q-saltans1 [30]. Substitutions on terminal branches are unique to individual paralogs and, provided sampling is sufficiently dense, should reflect the
neutral evolution of the dead-on-arrival fragments commonly generated by non-long terminal repeat (LTR) elements [30,31]. In this model, substitutions on the internal
branches should show substantially more third-position
changes compared with the first and second positions,
while substitutions on the terminal branches should fall

into these classes with equal probability. For internal
branches, we did indeed observe a sharp overabundance
of third-position changes (81 third-position changes compared with 45 other (first + second) position changes, P
<< 0.001, G-test). In contrast, we observed 199 other (first
+ second) changes and 107 third position changes on the
terminal branches, which is not significantly different
from the expected 2:1 ratio (P = 0.67, G-test). We used the
identified terminal branch substitutions for all subsequent analyses.
Intraspecific variability of the rates of nucleotide
substitution in D. melanogaster
To test for a shift in the pattern of background nucleotide
substitution in the saltans/willistoni group relative to that
of D. melanogaster, we compared background substitutional patterns derived from phylogenetic analyses of

inactive copies of transposable elements (Q-saltans1 in the
saltans/willistoni group versus the retrotransposable element Helena [32] and the non-autonomous DNA element
DNAREP1_DM [15] in D. melanogaster). To ensure that
comparisons between the patterns estimated from Qsaltans1 and the D. melanogaster transposable elements
truly reflect interspecific differences, we first ascertained
the amount of variability in the substitutional patterns
that could result from differences in (i) the identity of the

10 substitutions

elements and their specific sequences, (ii) the genomic
location of these transposable elements, and (iii) potential errors of phylogenetic reconstruction.
To assess variation in background substitutional patterns
associated with different types of nonfunctional elements
and their genomic location, we compared the substitutional profiles inferred from three types of transposable
elements in D. melanogaster (Figure 3A). Two of the pro-

files were inferred from patterns of nucleotide substitution in DNAREP1_DM [15]; we present the spectrum of
single-nucleotide substitutions assuming a star phylogeny
for both heterochromatic and euchromatic elements [15].
The third estimate of background substitutional patterns
in D. melanogaster was inferred from the terminal branch
substitutions of the maximum parsimony tree for Helena
[32]. In each of these three cases, we normalized the estimate of each of the six rates by the estimate of the total
substitution rate (which is a function of the mutation rate
and of the age of the individual elements), resulting in the
estimate of the relative rates of single-nucleotide substitution.
The only significant difference among these three types of
data was in the rate of the T:A → C:G transition, which was
significantly lower in heterochromatic sequences of
DNAREP1_DM compared with euchromatic fragments of
this element (P = 0.002, two-tailed t-test). However, the
magnitude of the difference in the rate of this transition is

quite small (Figure 3A, Table 2). Equilibrium GC content
inferred from the patterns of substitutions does vary
between heterochromatic and euchromatic sequences of
D. melanogaster, although the magnitude of the difference
is quite small, on the order of 3% [15]. Overall, however,
the substitutional profiles estimated using heterochromatic fragments of DNAREP1_DM, euchromatic fragments of DNAREP1_DM, and nonfunctional fragments of
the retrotransposon Helena are very similar.
To estimate the sensitivity of the patterns of substitution
to errors in phylogenetic reconstruction, we compared
rates of nucleotide substitution based on terminal branch
substitutions of maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood (HKY85) and neighbor-joining (distance) trees. We
explored this potential sensitivity to phylogenetic reconstruction in both the Q-saltans1 elements and the Helena
elements. For both transposable elements, there were no
significant differences in rates of individual nucleotide
substitutions (P > 0.2, all pairwise comparisons, two-

tailed t-test) (Figure 4A and 4B). In addition, comparisons
of equilibrium GC revealed no significant differences (P >
0.4, all pairwise comparisons, two-tailed t-test).
These results give us confidence that variability in the
identity and genomic location of the studied transposable
elements or potential errors of phylogenetic reconstructions do not significantly affect estimated patterns of single-nucleotide substitution for these data. Therefore, the
comparison of patterns of substitution derived from Qsaltans1 and from the D. melanogaster transposable elements should primarily reflect interspecific differences in
the patterns of nucleotide substitution. In all subsequent
analyses, we used the maximum parsimony tree for Qsaltans1 and Helena and a star phylogeny assumed for
DNAREP1_DM elements.
Comparisons of substitutional profiles between saltans
and willistoni lineages
The shift in the pattern of nucleotide substitutions is
hypothesized to have occurred prior to the split of the saltans and willistoni groups. We thus tested whether the patterns of substitution are indeed similar in the saltans and
willistoni species groups. To do so, we identified terminal
branch substitutions on the maximum parsimony tree of
Q-saltans1, and separated those substitutions occurring on
branches leading to paralogs isolated from a species in the
saltans group from those occurring on branches leading to
a paralog isolated from a species in the willistoni group.
These two classes of terminal branch substitutions were
then used to infer patterns of substitution specific to the
saltans and willistoni groups, respectively.

The estimated relative rates of single-nucleotide substitutions are presented in Figure 3B. None of the six substitutions was significantly different in pairwise comparisons
(P > 0.09, all comparisons, two-tailed t-test). This homogeneity in background substitutional patterns justifies
aggregation of all of the terminal branch substitutions on
the Q-saltans1 tree to estimate the overall pattern of singlenucleotide substitutions in the saltans/willistoni lineage.
Comparisons of substitutional profiles between D.
melanogaster and saltans/willistoni lineages
For simplicity, we present the comparison of the saltans/
willistoni substitutional profile with the most robust D.
melanogaster estimates, those derived from heterochro-

matic and euchromatic fragments of DNAREP1_DM. The
resulting profiles are presented in Figure 3C and the comparisons of rates are presented in Table 1. Two nucleotide
substitution rates are significantly different between the
D. melanogaster (both in euchromatin and heterochromatin) and saltans/willistoni lineages. The relative rate of T:A
→ G:C transversion is significantly lower, whereas the rate
of C:G → T:A transition is significantly higher in the saltans/willistoni groups (Bonferroni-corrected P << 0.0001
and P < 0.03, respectively, both comparisons, two-tailed ttest). In addition, we have tentative support for lower rates
of T:A → A:T and G:C → T:A substitutions in the saltans/
willistoni lineages, although these differences are not significant after correcting for multiple tests (P < 0.025, Bonferroni-corrected P > 0.05, both comparisons, two-tailed ttest). We also estimated predicted equilibrium GC content
(GC*) in both lineages based on the rates of nucleotide
substitutions, which revealed that GC* in the saltans and
willistoni groups (28.4%) is lower than that in heterochromatic and euchromatic fragments of D. melanogaster
(32.0% and 33.3%, respectively), although not significantly so (Bonferroni-corrected P > 0.1, both comparisons, one-tailed t-test). GC* estimated from transitions
only, while lower in D. saltans/willistoni (29.4%), was not
significantly different from comparable estimates in D.
melanogaster (30.9% and 32.7% in heterochromatic and
euchromatic sequences, respectively) (Bonferroni-corrected P > 0.2, both comparisons, one-tailed t-test).
This analysis was carried out using the combined data
from DNAREP1_DM fragments taken from low-recombination and high-recombination portions of the euchromatic fraction of the D. melanogaster genome. The
aggregation of these data is justified given the lack of statistically significant differences in equilibrium base composition between these regions [15]. However, the best
estimate of equilibrium GC content in high-recombination regions of D. melanogaster euchromatin is higher than
that in low-recombination regions, and thus we might be
underestimating the magnitude of the shift in GC content
in the saltans/willistoni lineages. Importantly, equilibrium
GC content (GC*) estimated from fragments of
DNAREP1_DM in regions of high recombination (35.0%)
is also not significantly different from GC* in the saltans/
willistoni lineages (Bonferroni-corrected P > 0.05, 1-tailed
t-test).

* Fixation bias is measured in the effective strength of natural selection (product of effective population size and selection coefficient) that would
generate such a bias. Positive sign implies preference for A:T pairs and negative sign implies preference toward G:C pairs.
** The number in parentheses is the standard error.

Are differences in mutation rates or differences in the
probabilities of fixation responsible for the differences in
substitution rates between these lineages?
The observed changes in nucleotide substitutions may
result from changes either in the mutation rates or in the
probability of fixation of different mutations. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we employed the
forward-reverse test [33]. In the case of the comparisons of
the saltans/willistoni rates with the rates derived from
euchromatic DNAREP1_DM elements in D. melanogaster,
the 95% confidence limits of the ratios of the forward and
reverse substitutions do allow for the theoretical possibility of the differences in fixation biases explaining the patterns (Table 2). However, the forward-reverse analysis
indicates that such differences in fixation probabilities
require G:C nucleotides to be very strongly preferred
when we consider changes in the rates of transitions
(|Nes| > 4 in both lineages) and strongly unpreferred
when we consider changes in the rates of transversions
(|Nes| > 2 in both lineages) (Table 2). On balance, a shift
in mutational patterns appears to be a more likely explanation.

Discussion
Estimating patterns of substitution using dead-on-arrival
copies of non-LTR elements
Previous data on the base composition of coding and coding sequences suggest that GC content in the saltans/willistoni group differs from GC content in D. melanogaster [2225,27,28]. The shift in GC content in coding sequences
has been argued to result from novel codon preferences in
this species group [27]. However, the observation that
base composition of noncoding sequences shows a shift
in GC content in the same direction (although to a lesser
degree) has been used as evidence in favor of a mutational
shift [22,25,28]. To distinguish among these possibilities,
we assayed background patterns of nucleotide substitution in unconstrained sequences. This method of using
inactive fragments of transposable elements has been
used previously to investigate patterns of background
point substitution and insertion/deletions in Drosophila
and other organisms [15,30,34].

To estimate background patterns of single-nucleotide substitutions, we identified a novel non-LTR element in D.
saltans. We cloned and sequenced 58 paralogous copies of
this Q-like retrotransposon (Q-saltans1) in nine species
from the willistoni and saltans groups. We analyzed substitutions that map to the terminal branches of the phylogenetic trees reconstructed using these sequences, and
extracted estimates of the individual rates of single-nucleotide substitutions using a maximum-likelihood procedure [35,36].
The pattern of single-nucleotide substitutions estimated
from this procedure conforms to our expectations of
unconstrained sequence evolution. Changes were equally
likely in all three codon positions, giving us confidence
that we indeed observe background patterns of substitution using these sequences. Moreover, our estimates of the
spectrum of single-nucleotide substitution are robust to
errors in phylogenetic reconstruction. Comparing the profile of background substitutional patterns derived from
various methods of phylogenetic reconstruction (maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and neighborjoining) yielded no significant differences; in all cases the
estimates of individual rates of single-nucleotide substitutions were virtually identical (P > 0.2, all comparisons,
two-tailed t-test).
Comparison of the patterns of substitution in dead-onarrival copies of Q-saltans1 and inactive copies of D.
melanogaster transposable elements
Patterns of background substitution revealed by the analysis of the inactive copies of Q-saltans1 appeared similar
for saltans and willistoni groups (Figure 3B), which is consistent with the shift in GC content occurring prior to the
separation of these lineages [22,25]. Therefore, we combined all of the Q-saltans1 data to estimate the overall pattern of background substitution in the saltans/willistoni
lineage.

The pattern of nucleotide substitution in D. melanogaster
was estimated using two different transposable elements:
Helena [30] and DNAREP1_DM [15]. The profiles of sin-

gle-nucleotide substitutions estimated from these different elements are strikingly similar (Figure 3A), suggesting
that the species-specific pattern of background substitution is largely insensitive to the identity of the transposable element studied. While small in magnitude, there do
appear to be heterogeneities in background substitutional
patterns associated with genomic location [15], and
accordingly, we treated euchromatic and heterochromatic
copies of DNAREP1_DM separately in our analysis.
Overall, the saltans/willistoni pattern is quite similar to the
patterns estimated in D. melanogaster (Figure 3C) and D.
virilis [30]. In all cases, the most frequent substitution is
the C:G → T:A transition, whereas the reverse transition
(T:A → C:G) occurs at rates similar to that of transversions
[32]. Moreover, the G:C → T:A transversion appears to be
most frequent transversions in both D. melanogaster and
the saltans/willistoni group.
However, the saltans/willistoni pattern does differ in two
respects from the pattern observed in D. melanogaster.
There is a statistically significant increase in the rate of C:G
→ T:A transitions and a significant decrease in the rate of
the T:A → G:C transversion in the willistoni/saltans lineage.
Notably, both of these changes lead to a reduction in the
overall GC content in saltans/willistoni lineages. However,
the expected equilibrium GC content based on the saltans/
willistoni pattern (28.4%) shifts only modestly (roughly
4–7%) compared with that estimated using
DNAREP1_DM (32.0%, 33.3% and 35.0% for heterochromatic, low-recombination euchromatic, and highrecombination euchromatic sequences, respectively).
Given the errors on our estimates of GC* for both species,
we can say with 95% confidence that the magnitude of the
difference in GC* between these two groups is at most
11.5% and could in fact be nonexistent.

Note, however, that if the shift toward higher rates of G:C
→ T:A and C:G → T:A substitutions in the saltans/willistoni
lineages was due entirely to the decrease of the probability
of fixation of G:C alleles at the expense of A:T alleles
(either due to the effects of natural selection or biased
gene conversion), we would then also expect to see a concomitant decrease in the rate of the reverse (T:A → G:C
and T:A → C:G) substitutions in the saltans/willistoni lineage. However, this does not appear to be the case for the
rates of C:G → T:A and T:A → C:G transitions (both of
which are increased in the saltans/willistoni lineage), or for
T:A → G:C and G:C → T:A transversions (both of which
are both decreased in the saltans/willistoni lineage) (Figure
3C).
We employed a more rigorous test to distinguish between
mutational variation and fixation biases for the shift in
background substitutional patterns in D. saltans/willistoni.
The forward-reverse test [33] suggests that while fixation
biases can in principle explain the difference in substitutional patterns between D. melanogaster and D. saltans/
willistoni, this model would require novel G:C mutations
to be strongly preferred when generated by a transition,
while being strongly unpreferred when generated by a
transversion. This eliminates the possibility of differences
in the strength of natural selection acting on GC content
being responsible for these patterns (as it cannot distinguish between A:T versus G:C polymorphisms generated
by transitions or transversions). This leaves only the possibility of differences in the strength of biased gene conversion. However, the strength of the putative bias in rates
of gene conversion seems extreme and appears implausible, requiring for instance that the rates of forward and
reverse mutations be different by over a hundred-fold
[33]. Thus, the most probable explanation for the
observed differences in substitution patterns in D. saltans/
willistoni is a change in the rates of mutation.

Distinguishing between mutational generation and
fixation probability models
A background substitutional bias can be mediated
through a bias either in the generation of novel mutations, or in the fixation probabilities of novel mutations.

Role of novel background substitutional patterns in
modulating base composition of coding and noncoding
sequences
Although we have documented a minor shift in background substitutional patterns in the saltans and willistoni
species groups, the extent to which this shift is reflected in
the base composition of coding and noncoding DNA
remains to be seen. Note that, given the divergence time
between D. melanogaster and D. saltans/D. willistoni of
approximately 30–40 million years [20] and the rates of
neutral point substitution in Drosophila [37], we would
expect that base composition of unconstrained sequences
in D. saltans and D. willistoni genomes should have
approached the equilibrium values corresponding to the
derived patterns of point substitution in the saltans/willistoni clade.

The documented shift in base composition of intronic
sequences is similar between short and long introns, and
appears to be minor. For D. melanogaster, D. saltans and D.
willistoni, the GC content of short introns is slightly lower
than that of long introns (Table 3). Base composition
shifts in D. saltans and willistoni to similar degrees in both
intron classes towards ~7% lower GC content in D. saltans
and ~2% lower GC content in D. willistoni [27,38]. The
magnitude of this shift in the base composition of
intronic sequences is entirely consistent with our estimates of the change in patterns of background substitution, which could generate a difference in GC content of
up to ~12%, although it is likely to be smaller.
In contrast, GC content in coding sequences, particularly
at third-position sites, in the saltans/willistoni group show
a much greater depression in GC content relative to D.
melanogaster than do introns [22-26] (Table 1). On average, GC content at third-position sites in D. saltans and D.
willistoni is 23.6% (13–30%) lower than that at the same
sites in D. melanogaster. The magnitude of this change in
GC content is incompatible with our estimates of background substitutional patterns, which suggests that other
evolutionary forces must be at play.
However, we do believe that our documented shift in substitutional biases may serve to modulate base composition at coding sites to some degree. Indeed, it is intriguing
that the amino acids with the most significant shifts in
codon usage are those two-fold amino acids encoded by
C/U-ending codons, as the relative rate of C:G → T:A substitutions has increased significantly in this lineage (Figure 3C). However, given that GC* estimated using all
substitutions is very similar to GC* estimated using only
transitions, it is not likely that this single pair of complementary nucleotide substitutions is wholly responsible
for the exaggerated response of the two-fold degenerate
amino acids.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/37

The dramatic shift in base composition in coding
sequences might very well reflect novel codon preferences
in this species group, as suggested by others [27]. In support of this model is the observation that some amino
acids show more marked changes in codon usage than
other amino acids in this clade [27], which is seemingly at
odds with a mutational model given that almost all preferred codons in D. melanogaster are G- or C-ending. In
addition, assuming that orthologous genes in D. melanogaster and D. saltans/willistoni are under similar selection
pressures for codon bias, the changing codon preference
model predicts that genes with the most highly biased patterns of codon usage will experience the greatest deviation
in codon usage patterns relative to D. melanogaster, which
is precisely what is observed [27].
It is important to note that there are two other forces that
may be contributing to the evolution of base composition
of coding and noncoding sequences in the saltans and
willistoni lineages. First, transcription-associated mutational biases appear to be operating in several systems (for
review see Aguilera [39]). Were such a bias operating in
Drosophila, this could also shape GC content of genic
sequences in this system; however, the concordance
between the expected GC content based on background
substitutional patterns and the observed GC content of
intronic sequences suggests that transcription-associated
mutational biases are unlikely to play a significant role in
the evolution of base composition of genic sequences in
the saltans/willistoni lineages. Moreover, comparisons of
background substitutional patterns in transcribed and
untranscribed sequences in D. melanogaster also show no
evidence of transcription-associated mutational biases
[15].
Second, the marked reduction in GC content of exonic
sequences in D. saltans and willistoni could also result
from a relaxation of natural selection on codon bias in
these lineages. This could in principle result from a reduction in effective population size, but this model would
require a severe and prolonged bottleneck in the lineage
leading to the saltans/willistoni species group, or concomitant reductions in effective population size for all species
in this group. Alternatively, weaker selection on codon
bias in the saltans/willistoni group could reflect lineagespecific fitness effects for synonymous mutations. As is the
case in D. saltans and D. willistoni, several other species in
the D. melanogaster subgroup show significant changes in
codon bias in the absence of marked base-composition
heterogeneity of nearby noncoding sequences, which has
been argued to result from either a relaxation of selection
on codon bias mediated through lineage-specific changes
in effective population size, from fitness effects, [10,40] or
from positive selection [41].

BMC Biology 2006, 4:37

Like the changing codon preference model, a general
model of relaxation of selection on codon bias in D. saltans/willistoni would also predict that the genes with the
highest codon bias would experience the greatest deviation in codon usage in D. saltans/willistoni relative to D.
melanogaster. Formally distinguishing between the shifting
codon preference and relaxation of selection models by
specifically comparing codon usage preferences in lowly
and highly expressed genes between D. melanogaster and
D, willistoni at a larger scale will soon become possible,
once the D. willistoni genome has been assembled and
annotated.

Conclusion
Analysis of substitutional patterns inferred from nonfunctional fragments of transposable elements in the Drosophila saltans/willistoni lineage provides evidence in
support of a minor shift in patterns of nucleotide substitution towards decreased GC content of at most 11.5%.
These novel patterns of nucleotide substitution are likely
modulating the base composition of unconstrained
sequences in the genome, and are sufficient to account for
documented shift in GC content of noncoding sequences
such as introns. The base composition of sequences under
selective constraint such as coding sequences, however,
while governed in part by substitutional biases, appear to
be primarily modulated by other evolutionary forces. In
this particular instance, one likely explanation for the
reduction in GC content in coding sequences in the saltans/willistoni group is a shift in codon preferences combined with an altered substitutional profile. However,
general relaxation of selective pressure on codon bias in
this species group is also possible, and further investigation will likely reveal the relative strengths of substitutional biases and natural selection in the determination of
base composition of functional sequences.

Insect Science Stock center, which correspond to D. neocordata, D. emarginata, D. subsaltans, and D. prosaltans,
respectively.

Genomic DNA extraction
We extracted genomic DNA from single individuals taken
from these nine strains of Drosophila according to protocol
described by Greg Gloor and William Engels (personal
communication). Each fly was crushed with the end of a
pipette tip and subsequently immersed in a buffered solution (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.2, 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaCl,
200 µg/mL proteinase K). This was incubated at 37°C for
30 minutes, and then at 95°C for 2 minutes to inactivate
the proteinase K.
Species confirmation
To confirm the species assignment for each of the nine
strains, we amplified and sequenced a portion of the xanthine dehydrogenase (Xdh) gene (rosy in D. melanogaster).
The region of Xdh studied is approximately 725 bp in size
and includes part of exon II in addition to intron B, the
distribution of which is confined to the saltans and willistoni lineages [42]. Primer sequences were: XDHF: 5' -CGTTCYTTGGTWGTWAGYC-3'
and
XDHR:
5'
GCAAAGGCYTCCTCCACATT-3'.

Amplifying conditions for the Xdh regions for each of the
nine species are as follows: 94°C for 2 min, 35 cycles of
94°C for 30s, 52°C for 30s, 72°C for 30s, and a final
extension of 72°C for 7 min. All PCR reactions were 20 µl,
and each contained 10 µl ReadyMix REDTaq PCR Reaction Mix with MgCl2 (Sigma-Adrich, St Louis, MO, USA),
1 µl of each 20 µM primer, 7 µl H2O, and 1 µl genomic
DNA. PCR reactions were enzymatically cleaned with exonuclease I and shrimp alkaline phosphatase, and were
cycle-sequenced in half-strength half-reactions with Big
Dye terminator mix (Applied Biosystems) under standard
cycling conditions. These reactions were precipitated
using ethanol and sodium acetate and sequenced on an
ABI 377 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequences were
compared with the available sequences for this region in
each species [28], with intron B serving as a diagnostic
marker.
Identification of non-LTR elements
Degenerate primers designed for the reverse transcriptase
domain of non-LTR retrotransposable elements in Arabidopsis were used to amplify potential retrotransposons in
Drosophila saltans. Primer sequences were: DVO144: 5' GGGATCCNGGNCCNGAYGGNWT-3' and DVO145: 5' GGAATTCGGNSWNARNGGRYMNCCYTG-3' [43]. All
PCR reactions were 20 µl, and each contained 10 µl ReadyMix REDTaq PCR reaction mix with MgCl2 (SigmaAldrich), 0.8 µl of 25 mM MgCl2, 1.25 µl of each 20 µM
primer, 5.7 µl H2O, and 1 µl genomic DNA. Cycling conditions were: 94°C for 2 min, 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min,
47°C for 1 min, 72°C for 2 min, and a final extension of
72°C for 15 min.

The pool of PCR products was cloned using a TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen) for sequencing, and PCR (using vector
primers T7 and M13R) was used to screen for colonies
containing appropriately sized inserts. PCR products of
interest were enzymatically cleaned with exonuclease I
and shrimp alkaline phosphatase, and were cyclesequenced in half-strength half-reactions with Big Dye
(Applied Biosystems) under standard cycling conditions.
These reactions were precipitated using ethanol and
sodium acetate and sequenced on an ABI 377 sequencer
(Applied Biosystems).
These sequences were compared against sequences of all
known non-LTR elements using BLASTX to identify clones
containing inserts truly corresponding to retrotransposable elements. This technique yielded one clone containing
a 271-bp insert with high homology to reverse transcriptases from other organisms, and has highest homology to the Q retrotransposon isolated from Anopheles
gambiae [29]; specific primers for this putative Q element
were designed from the sequence of this clone.
Amplification of non-LTR elements in saltans and
willistoni clades
These element-specific primers were used to amplify paralogous copies of this Q element in several species in the
saltans and willistoni clades. Primer sequences are as follows: SaltansQF: 5' -CCGGATGGGATAGCTG-3' and SaltansQR:
5'
-GGTTAGCGGTAGTAGATGTA-3'.
Amplifications were carried out in 20 µl reactions. For species in the saltans clade, each PCR reaction contained 10 µl
ReadyMix REDTaq PCR reaction mix with MgCl2 (Sigma),
1 µl of each 20-µM element-specific primer, 7 µl H2O, and
1 µl genomic DNA. Cycling conditions were: 94°C for 2
min, 35 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 47°C for 1 min, 72°C
for 2 min, and a final extension of 72°C for 15 min.

For species in the willistoni clade, two rounds of PCR were
required for successful amplification. First, a 20-µl reaction using DVO144 and DVO145 primers was carried out
as described above. This PCR product was diluted 1:1000
and was used as template in a second round of PCR amplification using element-specific primers as described for
the species in the saltans clade.
Products from PCR reactions using element-specific primers were cloned for each of the nine species under study.
Colonies of interest were sequenced using T7 and M13R;
paralogs differing by <1% within an individual species
were not included in the analysis.
Analysis of background substitutional patterns
In total, 58 distinct paralogous fragments (271 bp in
length) of a non-LTR element were identified from the saltans and willistoni species groups. Sequences have been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/37

deposited to Genbank (under accession numbers
AY920638-AY920695). We aligned the sequences using
Sequencher software (version 3.1.1), and used PAUP software (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony; version
4.0b9) for the phylogenetic reconstruction of the relationships among the paralogous retrotransposons. Based on
this phylogeny, we inferred the ancestral sequence at each
terminal node; substitution frequencies were estimated by
comparing those ancestral sequences with the sequences
of the extant fragments.
The extant sequences show on average 5.2% divergence
from the ancestral sequences at their respective terminal
nodes on the phylogeny. For the estimation of the substitution frequencies, we used a maximum-likelihood
approach to include multiple and back substitutions
within one branch at the same site. Importantly, we cannot capture multiple substitutions on different branches.
However, owing to the low divergence among paralogs of
Q-saltans1, the associated error due to such processes is
likely to be quite small. All 12 possible single-nucleotide
substitutions have been estimated. Details on a more general version of this approach including neighbor-dependent substitution processes have been discussed by Arndt et
al. [35,36]. Once the 12 substitution frequencies are established, the stationary GC content (GC*) can easily be
computed [44].
Because we only have a finite amount of sequence data
from which to estimate the substitution frequencies, these
estimates will be affected by statistical errors; we can estimate these errors by bootstrapping our dataset. For a category with a total of n aligned base pairs we resampled the
data, drawing randomly and with replacement, n pairs of
aligned ancestral and daughter nucleotides. From this
resampled sequence data, we estimated the substitution
frequencies and the GC content as above. We repeated this
resampling procedure M times, and from the M estimates
of the above quantities calculated their standard deviation, which gave the statistical error due to the limited
amount of sequence data. In our case, we found that M =
500 samples is sufficient to estimate those errors [36].
Background substitutional patterns in D. melanogaster
Substitution patterns from D. melanogaster were inferred
in three ways. Two profiles are based on autosomal copies
of the element DNAREP1_DM [15], and we present data
from elements found in both heterochromatic and
euchromatic sequences. Although initial analysis of background substitutional patterns using DNAREP1_DM did
distinguish between elements in high- versus low-recombination areas of the genome, there were no significant
differences revealed between these two genomic locations
[15]. As a result, these data were combined in the present
analyses and are referred to as "euchromatic" elements.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/37

The pattern of substitutions does significantly differ
between heterochromatic and euchromatic regions in D.
melanogaster, but the differences are very small in magnitude [15].

We also present data from the retrotransposon Helena
[45], which is based on 22 paralogs of this transposable
element. These data were analyzed in the same way as the
data from D. saltans and willistoni; phylogenies were
reconstructed using PAUP, ancestral sequences at each terminal node were inferred, and substitution frequencies
were estimated by comparing those ancestral sequences
with the sequences of the extant fragments in a maximumlikelihood framework. Details on a more general version
of the maximum-likelihood model used to estimate substitutional patterns in D. melanogaster including neighbordependent substitution processes have been discussed by
Arndt et al. [35].
