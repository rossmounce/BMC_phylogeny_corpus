Clustering of classical swine fever virus isolates
by codon pair bias
Immanuel Leifer1*, Dirk Hoeper2, Sandra Blome2, Martin Beer2 and Nicolas Ruggli1

Abstract
Background: The genetic code consists of non-random usage of synonymous codons for the same amino acids,
termed codon bias or codon usage. Codon juxtaposition is also non-random, referred to as codon context bias or
codon pair bias. The codon and codon pair bias vary among different organisms, as well as with viruses. Reasons
for these differences are not completely understood. For classical swine fever virus (CSFV), it was suggested that
the synonymous codon usage does not significantly influence virulence, but the relationship between variations in
codon pair usage and CSFV virulence is unknown. Virulence can be related to the fitness of a virus: Differences in
codon pair usage influence genome translation efficiency, which may in turn relate to the fitness of a virus.
Accordingly, the potential of the codon pair bias for clustering CSFV isolates into classes of different virulence was
investigated.
Results: The complete genomic sequences encoding the viral polyprotein of 52 different CSFV isolates were
analyzed. This included 49 sequences from the GenBank database (NCBI) and three newly sequenced genomes.
The codon usage did not differ among isolates of different virulence or genotype. In contrast, a clustering of
isolates based on their codon pair bias was observed, clearly discriminating highly virulent isolates and vaccine
strains on one side from moderately virulent strains on the other side. However, phylogenetic trees based on the
codon pair bias and on the primary nucleotide sequence resulted in a very similar genotype distribution.
Conclusion: Clustering of CSFV genomes based on their codon pair bias correlate with the genotype rather than
with the virulence of the isolates.

Background
Classical swine fever (CSF) is a serious and highly contagious disease of pigs that can cause important economical losses in the pig industries [1,2]. The disease is
caused by the classical swine fever virus (CSFV), currently endemic in wild boars and in part also in domestic pigs in Asia, South America, and parts of Central
and Eastern Europe [1,3,4]. Depending on the isolate,
the disease can vary from an acute hemorrhagic fever to
a chronic or unapparent infection. An acute infection
with a highly virulent strain manifests with high fever,
respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, multiple haemorrhages, neurological disorders, and a high mortality
rate [5]. Chronic infections may not be immediately
recognized due to the mild symptoms. Infections with

low virulent isolates can remain unapparent. Thus CSFV
viruses are divided into strains of highly, moderately,
and low to avirulent strains (mainly vaccine strains)
[6,7], see also Table 1 with the references therein. A
number of live attenuated vaccines are available. These
vaccines are mostly based on the Chinese vaccine strain
(C-strain) and are completely avirulent [8-10].
CSFV is classified within the genus Pestivirus of the
family Flaviviridae together with Border disease virus
(BDV) and Bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) [33].
Pestiviruses possess a single-stranded positive-sense
RNA genome of approximately 12300 nucleotides, with
5’-terminal and 3’-terminal non-translated regions (5’NTR, 3’-NTR) [34]. The genome encodes one polyprotein that is co- and post-translationally processed by the
viral proteases Npro, NS2, NS3, and by cellular proteases
[34]. The polyprotein is cleaved in the four structural
proteins C, Erns, E1, E2, and in the eight non-structural

Virulence status: highly virulent (hv), moderately virulent (mv), low virulent (lv) or vaccine strains (va), and unknown virulence (uk) is indicated according to the
information available. If available, the references to the sequences are indicated.
1
Brescia M31768 lv1 is representing the sequence of strain Brescia C1.1.1 which is a low virulent strain obtained after the 30th passage of strain Brescia on PK-15
cells [31].
2
CAP X96550 lv2 is described as highly virulent strain in some publications, but was originally described as cell culture adapted strain of low virulence [15].
3
Glentorf U45478 lv3 is described as low virulent or as highly virulent strain, depending on the report. In this study it is considered to be low virulent according
to the publication of Handel et al. and Ahrens et al. [18,32]
4
CSF 39 AF407339 mv4 is a recombinant CSFV from China [27]. The virulence of this strain cannot be related to a particular genotype because the 5’NTR and the
3’NTR as well as the NS5A/B genes are homologous to genotype 1.1 strains, while the structural genes are homologous to genotype 2.1 strains. Furthermore the
sequence of the original isolate is not known since the 32nd cell culture passage was used for sequence analysis.

proteins Npro, p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and
NS5B [35-37].
By phylogenetic classification, the CSFV strains are
divided into the three different genotypes 1, 2, and 3,
every genotype consisting of three to four subgenotypes
[38]. The most recent CSFV outbreaks in the European
Community are associated essentially with isolates that
cluster in the genotype 2. In general, the genotype 2 isolates are of moderate or low virulence, as are the isolates
of genotype 3 [3,4,39]. To the best of our knowledge,
the CSFV strains with the highest virulence identified so
far all belong to genotype 1. However, there is no absolute relationship between genotype and virulence, as
there are also low virulent field isolates (e.g. “Glentorf”)
of genotype 1, and isolates within the genotype 2 group
(e.g. “Uelzen”) for which infection of piglets results in
higher mortality than with most genotype 2 isolates. In
addition, all vaccine strains belong also to genotype 1, as
they were derived from genotype 1 strains by attenuation through multiple passages in non natural hosts,
typically rabbits and guinea pigs, or in cell cultures
derived from them.
Various experimental approaches were implemented
with the aim of identifying the virulence determinants
related to a particular CSFV isolate. Numerous mutants
with deletions, insertions, peptide or amino acid
exchanges were analyzed and described in detail [40-46].
All mutants described so far were attenuated, leading to
the conclusions that the modified positions may be relevant for the virulence of a specific strain or of CSFV in
general. Certainly, strain-specific virulence factors determine whether an infection results in acute hemorrhagic
fever, chronic disease or subclinical infection. Whether
virulence determinants can be associated with particular
amino acid positions remains unanswered. From a general point of view however, one may speculate that virulence depends mostly on the speed and level of virus
replication. For poliovirus and influenza virus it was

shown that the codon pair bias can influence fitness and
virulence [47,48]. The codon pair bias refers to the non
random juxtaposition of codons, while the non random
usage of synonymous codons for the same amino acids
is referred to as codon bias. Previous studies showed
that differences in synonymous codon usage did not
relate to the virulence of CSFV isolates [7]. There is no
analysis of codon pair usage of CSFV available. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether
the codon pair usage of CSFV may relate to virulence or
simply cluster the isolates into their genotype.

Results
Sequencing of complete genomes of recent CSFV isolates

In order to include some of the latest European CSFV isolates in the codon pair bias analysis, the genome of three
recent field isolates were sequenced. The complete nucleotide sequences of the isolates CSFV/2.3/dp/CSF0821/
2002/HR/Novska, CSFV/2.3/dp/CSF864/2007/BG/Jambul,
and CSFV/2.1/dp/CSF1048/2009/LT/Penevezys were
deposited to the NCBI GenBank nucleotide database
[GenBank: HQ148061-HQ148063]. The genomes of the
newly sequenced isolates encode a polyprotein of 3898
amino acids. The 5’NTRs of the three isolates are 373
nucleotides long. The 3’NTR is composed of 225 nucleotides for the “Novska” isolate and of 226 nucleotides for
the two other isolates. These three sequences were
included in a phylogenetic tree together with 49 complete
CSFV genome sequences obtained from GenBank (Figure
1). The three newly sequenced isolates belong to the genotype 2, with the isolates “Novska” and “Jambul” clustering
with the subgenotype 2.3 strains and the isolate “Penevezys” belonging to subgenotype 2.1. With experimental
infections of pigs, the isolate “Penevezys” was classified as
low to moderately virulent whereas the two other isolates
were moderately virulent. Detailed information on the
genotype, virulence, and origin of the 52 CSFV isolates
analysed are provided in Table 1.

The relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) does not
vary among different CSFV isolates

In order to determine the variations in RSCU between
CSFV isolates of different genotypes and virulence, the

frequency of each codon was determined for the 52
complete genome sequences available. As an example,
the codon usage of three prototype isolates of different
virulence, the low virulent “Glentorf” strain, the highly

Leifer et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:521
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/4/521

virulent “Koslov” strain, and the moderately virulent
“Euskirchen” isolate is shown in Figure 2A-C . All
three virus isolates have a very similar RSCU pattern.
The two codons encoding the amino acid lysine (AAA
and AAG) are the most frequent codons appearing in
the CSFV genomes. The AAG triplet is slightly preferred. AAA is found in average 142,4 times/polyprotein with a standard deviation of 3.8 whereas AAG is
found in average 151,6 times/polyprotein with a standard deviation of 3.6, independently of genotype and
virulence. For the amino acid arginine there is a total
of six different codons possible: CGA, CGC, CGG,
CGU, AGA, and AGG. The four codons CGA, CGC,
CGG, CGU are amongst the rarest codons used in all
isolates. Thus, arginine is encoded almost exclusively
by AGA and AGG, but here again, no major differences between strains of different virulence can be
observed. Overall, no significant differences were
observed between the different isolates confirming

earlier results showing that the RSCU does not vary
between strains of different virulence [7].
The codon pair bias clusters CSFV into groups of different
genotypes

Since the analysis of RSCU did not reveal any obvious
differences among isolates of different virulence, it was
of interest to determine whether the codon pair usage
differs between CSFV isolates. To this end, the ANACONDA 2.0 software was applied to analyse the codon
pair bias of the polyprotein encoding sequences of the
52 CSFV isolates. As opposed to the RSCU, clear differences were observed between different isolates (Figure
3). The codon pair analysis clustered the isolates in two
groups, one representing the avirulent and the highly
virulent strains, and the other the moderately virulent
strains. The codon pairs CAA-AGA and GCA-GGG for
instance are preferred by moderately virulent strains,
but strongly rejected among vaccine viruses and highly

virulent strains. On the other hand, the pairs UACGGU, UAC-GAU, AGA-CUA, and GCA-GAA are preferred by vaccine and highly virulent viruses and are
rejected by moderately virulent strains. Remarkably, the
codon pairs with the pattern UAC-GGN and UACGAN strongly rejected among moderately virulent
strains. Pairwise comparison of the complete codon pair
context maps of vaccine strains among each other, and

those of vaccine and highly virulent strains revealed
similar degrees of variability (exemplified in Figure 4AD). Interestingly, the diversity within the group of vaccine strains is in some cases higher compared to the
diversity between vaccine strains and highly virulent
strains (Figure 4A-D).
It was also hypothesised that the codon pair bias may
affect specifically the genome replication efficiency. In

ANACONDA 2.0; 61 × 64 codon pair bias matrices are shown. Yellow spots indicate differences in the corresponding codon pair usage
whereas black colour means that codon pairs are used with similar residual values. Shown are codon pair overlays of the “GPE-“ vaccine strain
and the parental highly virulent “ALD” strain (A), of the highly virulent “ALD” and “Koslov” strains (B), of the “GPE-“ and “C-strain Riems” vaccine

order to determine whether the codon pair bias differs
between the replicase and the structural proteins,
which would suggest a potential effect of the codon
pair bias on replication efficiency and virulence, artificial open reading frames ORFs were constructed covering the structural proteins and the NS5B protein of
each CSFV strain. These ORFs were compared with
respect to codon pair usage. No obvious differences in
codon pair usage between structural and replicase
genes were found, irrespectively of genotype and virulence (data not shown). Therefore, analysis of the individual genes did not allow discrimination between
virulence either.
Finally, a phylogenetic tree based on the codon pair
usage of the complete polyprotein encoding nucleotide
sequences of the 52 isolates was constructed using the
ANACONDA 2.0 software (Figure 5). The codon pair
usage clusters the isolates in genotypes 1, 2, 3, and subgenotypes 2.1 and 2.3, similarly to the phylogenetic tree
based on the primary nucleotide sequence (compare Figures 1 and 5). Interestingly, some vaccine strains are
grouped with the highly virulent strains, e. g. the strains
“Alfort” and “Thiverval”. According to these data, the
codon pair bias clusters the CSFV isolates by genotype
rather than by virulence.

Discussion
Despite numerous efforts, CSFV virulence could not be
linked to any particular genome sequence signature so
far. Most if not all highly virulent CSFV strains belong
to genotype 1 as do the vaccine strains (Table 1 and the
references listed therein). Moderately virulent strains
belong essentially to genotypes 2 and 3. The genetic
variability within the genotype 1 is lower compared to
strains of genotype 2 and 3 [49,50]. This lets hypothesize that sequence signatures of virulence may be found,
especially with full sequence data of vaccine strains and
parental highly virulent strains [51].

From the functional point of view, virulence may
depend on viral replication efficiency, which can be
influenced by differences in protein expression. Codon
and codon pair bias can have an impact on translation
efficiency and protein expression as it was shown for
bacteria and yeast [52,53]. For poliovirus and influenza
A virus, the artificial use of rare codons and of underrepresented codon pairs reduced viral protein translation
and viral fitness, resulting in virus attenuation in vivo
[47,48]. Consequently, a potential influence of codon
usage and in particular of codon pair usage on CSFV
virulence was considered. The analysis of the RSCU of
52 virus isolates covering the whole spectrum of virulence did not reveal any relationship with virulence.
This confirmed earlier results obtained with the complete genome sequences of 35 isolates [7]. Thus codon
usage between CSFV isolates is very similar, which is in
agreement with the findings that RNA viruses of the
same host category have the same codon usage preferences [54]. For the human immunodeficiency virus type1, the RSCU is different from that of the human host.
Adaptation towards human RSCU was attributed to the
homogenization of the codon usage by mutation pressure rather than host adaptation [55].
Analysis of the codon pair bias of the complete coding
sequence of the 52 isolates revealed a clear clustering
(Figure 3). Vaccine strains and highly virulent strains
showed mostly the same pattern, differing from the
codon pair usage of moderately virulent strains. Because
highly virulent and vaccine strains belong to genotype 1
and moderately virulent strains belong essentially to
genotype 2, similarities in codon pair usage within a
genotype might be due to the high proportion of
sequence identity. Indeed, the genotype clustering
obtained with phylogenetic analysis based on the codon
pair usage and on the primary nucleotide sequence was
nearly identical (compare Figures 5 and 1). Nevertheless,
this does not exclude a possible relationship of the

codon pair usage with the virulence phenotype. The codon
pair UAC-GNN for instance is less preferred by CSFV
strains of genotype 2. Cytosin-phosphatidyl-Guanin (CpG)
dinucleotides are signals for DNA methylation in

eukaryotes and regulate gene expression [56,57]. A reduction of UAC-GNN codon pair usage could reflect a hostspecific adaption, as it might influence the host anti-viral
response as described for other viruses [58,59]. For CSFV

Leifer et al. BMC Research Notes 2011, 4:521

it is unknown whether adaptation to the host is linked to a
gain of viral fitness. One could hypothesize that highly
virulent CSFV strains would emerge through increased
viral replication in the host. However, adaptation to the
host is likely to result in optimized rather than in
enhanced replication since occurrence of higher virulent
strains has not been observed in CSFV field isolates during
the last years [3,4,39,60]. From the evolutionary point of
view, natural selection or adaptation towards a moderately
virulent strain makes sense, because the mortality of the
host is lower [39,60,61]. In addition, failure in early diagnosis due to mild clinical symptoms contributes to the dissemination and survival of the virus [59]. Thus, a
moderately or low virulent virus has a greater chance of
circulating in a pig or wild boar population without being
detected [62-64]. Hence the reduced virulence observed
with the CSFV isolates from the more recent outbreaks in
Europe could result from several driving forces representing advantages for the virus. In fact, during the last decades CSFV outbreaks in Europe and Asia were
increasingly caused by genotype 2 and 3 isolates, while the
older CSFV field isolates belong to genotype 1. This suggests that evolution of CSFV is directed towards genotype
2 and 3. However, it is unknown if this is applicable to
South American isolates since sequence information is
missing. The development of live attenuated CSFV vaccine
strains was based on isolates belonging to the genotype 1,
which explains the close phylogenetic relationship between
highly virulent and vaccine strains within the same genotype. Interestingly, there are nevertheless obvious differences in codon pair usage among strains of genotype 1 as
seen from the overlays of codon pair matrices. These differences are the most prominent between the two unrelated “GPE-” and “C-strain” vaccine strains attenuated in
guinea pigs and rabbits, respectively. It is likely that these
differences are in part caused by the propagation of the
viruses in different hosts.

Conclusions
The present results describe the first extensive codon
pair bias analysis of a representative number of CSFV
isolates covering the complete spectrum of virulence.
Overall, the CSFV strains can be grouped in two main
clusters according to the codon pair usage. Thus codon
pair bias analysis can support CSFV phylogeny. However, based on the data presented here, a direct link
between the codon pair usage and CSFV virulence cannot be established.
Methods
Sequencing of complete CSFV genomes

Nucleotide sequence analysis of complete CSFV genome
was performed by pyrosequencing with a FLX Genome
Sequencer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) as

Page 9 of 11

described previously [3]. Briefly, full CSFV genome
DNA fragments (obtained by long-range RT-PCR) were
separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified
using the Zymoclean™ Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo
Research Corporation, Orange, CA, USA) prior to analysis with the FLX Genome Sequencer. The 5’NTR and
3’NTR were sequenced using commercial kits for RACE
RT-PCR (5’RACE System and 3’RACE System, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturers
recommendations. Minor modifications were performed
as described previously [3]. The raw sequence data were
assembled using the GS assembler software newbler (v.
2.0.00.22; Roche, Mannheim). The nucleotide sequence
information was deposited to the NCBI GenBank
nucleotide database [65].
Sequence data source and additional sequence
information

Complete genome sequences of 49 different CSFV isolates were obtained from the NCBI GenBank nucleotide
database. Detailed information on the virus isolates is
provided in Table 1. Virus isolates were grouped in
highly virulent (hv), moderately virulent (mv), and low
virulent (lv) or vaccine strains (va). According to the
information available, 46 virus isolates were subdivided
into these three groups composed of 16 highly virulent,
14 moderately virulent, and 16 vaccine strains (Table 1).
For the remaining virus isolates virulence could not be
determined.
Analysis of RSCU and codon pair usage

The relative synonymous codon usage is expressed as
RSCU value of a codon [53]. The RSCU value expresses
the relationship between the observed and the expected
codon frequency and was calculated with the ANACONDA 2.0 software (Universidade de Aveiro, Portugal)
[66]. The codon context bias of the complete polyprotein encoding nucleotide sequence of 52 different CSFV
isolates was investigated using the software package
ANACONDA 2.0 as described [67-69]. In addition, different regions of the genomes were analysed separately.
To this end, artificial ORFs for the NS5B and the structural protein genes were constructed by adding a start
and stop codon to the corresponding coding regions.
Codon pair biases were analysed according to their relative occurrence. Statistical calculation of the codon pairs
is given in relation to its real occurrence and the
expected incidence independently of their distribution.
The ANACONDA 2.0 software displays a codon pair
context map for each viral ORF. This context map consists of 3904 possible codon pairs given in a vertical raw
with one coloured square for each codon pair. The colours represent the frequency of occurrence: red
coloured squares indicate codon pairs that are strongly

rejected, whereas preferred codon pairs are represented
in green colour. Codon pairs represented by black
squares are statistically not significant.
Phylogenetic trees based on codon pair bias were created with the ANACONDA 2.0 software. Neighbourjoining trees with the maximum composite likelihood
method using complete polyprotein encoding nucleotide
sequences were constructed with the MEGA4 software
(Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis, Center for
Evolutionary Medicine and Informatics, Tempe, USA)
software [69].
