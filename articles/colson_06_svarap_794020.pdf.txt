Abstract
Background: Simple computerized methods that analyse variability along alignments of nucleotide
or amino acid sequences can be very useful in a clinical microbiology laboratory for two main
purposes. First, to optimize primer selection, which is critical for the identification of infectious
pathogens based on gene sequencing: primers must target conserved nucleotide regions bordering
highly variable areas to ensure discrimination of species. Second, it can be of interest to reveal
mutations associated with drug resistance of pathogen agents. Our aim was therefore to test easy
and cost-free tools (SVARAP and aSVARAP) that require short hands-on work, little expertise, and
which allow visual interpretation and statistical analysis of results.
Results: We first tested SVARAP to improve a strategy of identification of streptococci species of
the Viridans Group targeting the groESL gene. Two regions with <500 nucleotides were identified,
one being significantly more discriminant than one of a similar length used in a previous study (mean
number of nucleotide differences between species, 113 (range: 12–193) vs. 77 (range: 14–109); p
< 10-3). Secondly, aSVARAP was tested on reverse transcriptase (RT) sequences from 129 HIV-1
clinical strains to identify natural polymorphisms and drug-selected mutations emerging under
nucleoside RT inhibitor (NRTI)-selective pressure. It revealed eleven of the 18 RT mutations
considered in a reference HIV-1 genotypic NRTI-resistance interpretation algorithm.
Conclusion: SVARAP and aSVARAP are simple, versatile and helpful tools for analysis of sequence
variability, and are currently being used in real practice in our clinical microbiology laboratory.

Background
Sequence variability is a major parameter when designing
primers and probes for a new PCR assay, even if various
other factors such as string-based alignment scores, melting temperature, primer length and GC contents are also
critical [1]. Indeed, nucleotide primers are designed to

specifically target a nucleotide region that must be conserved as much as possible in order to ensure their hybridization. Conversely, when nucleotide sequences are used
to identify or classify strains, the amplified and then
sequenced region has to be divergent enough for discrimination. Variability is also a very informative property of

nucleotide and protein sequences. For instance, it may
indicate if a region is targeted or not by a given selective
pressure or if mutations are occurring under drug-selective
pressure.
The analysis of the variability of a genetic or protein
region is generally impractical, exacting, and based upon
non-objective criteria when performed visually from a
multiple sequence alignment. Difficulties are compounded by the length of sequences and their diversity.
We therefore developed cost-free tools on Microsoft Excel
2000 software to improve identification and analysis of
variable regions in nucleotide and amino acid sequences.
These programs, SVARAP (for Sequence VARiability Analysis Program) and aSVARAP (for amino acid Sequence
VARiability Analysis Program), use a very simple
approach to analyse, reveal, and plot in graphics the variability along multiple nucleotide or amino acid sequences
alignments. They combine several advantages: (i) easy
handling and interpretation of results, which means quick
training of new users, (ii) brief hands-on work (<15 min);
(iii) visual interpretation of results that are plotted in
graphical windows; (iv) quantification of variability,
which allows statistical analysis; (v) versatility, with various targets, such as bacterial or viral genomes, and various
purposes, mainly primer or probe design for PCR assays
or study of natural and drug-selected polymorphisms. In
the present study, in order to illustrate the versatility of
our programs, two applications for clinical microbiology
were tested: firstly, to design primers for sequence amplification and identification in streptococci, and secondly,
to identify natural polymorphisms and drug-selected
mutations in HIV-1.

portion of sequences that differ from the consensus at a
given site. Variability is calculated as follows: 100 – (maximum frequency for each of the four nucleotides at a given
position). The data are also processed to calculate median,
mean, highest and lowest variability for a non-sliding
window of 50 nucleotides, with standard deviations.
Moreover, SVARAP calculates along the whole alignment
the mean variability for a sliding window of 25 nucleotides. This length was chosen because it approximately
corresponds to the length of a primer. Thus, simultaneous
site-by-site analysis and nucleotide window analysis can
be performed to reveal the regions with particular patterns
of variability. All of these data are available in different
sheets in tables or are plotted in graphical windows to
allow visual interpretation. All tables or figures are printable. Hypertext links allow access to these tables or plots,
and easy return to the home page. The quantitative results
obtained from SVARAP can be copied for further comparison of data obtained from several sets of sequences, or
graphical representation of the sequence variability for
longer regions (>4,000 nucleotides) than initially proposed. An example of the use of SVARAP is available on
the World Wide Web [4].
The aSVARAP is an in-house program derived from
SVARAP and dedicated to amino acid sequences, the principle and use being the same as for SVARAP. We first generate with ClustalX v.1.83 an alignment from a set of up
to 100 sequences with a maximal length of 1,000 amino
acids for each sequence. Then, our program calculates the
proportion of sequences harboring an amino acid at a
given position that is not the most frequently found in the
studied set of sequences.

Implementation

Results

SVARAP user manual is available on the World Wide Web
[2]. SVARAP can simultaneously process and analyse sets
of up to 100 sequences with a maximal length of 4,000
nucleotides for each sequence. All sequences of the studied set of sequences are aligned with ClustalX, version
1.83 [3]. SVARAP uses an alignment in GDE format
(Genetic Data Environment) generated by ClustalX.
Aligned sequences are copied, then pasted into a cell of
the main page of our Microsoft Excel file and automatically processed. Each nucleotide for each sequence is automatically assigned to a different cell in order to align
nucleotides corresponding to a given position in the
alignment in successive lines of the same column. The
SVARAP calculates for each nucleotide site in the alignment the consensus nucleotide (defined as the most common nucleotide at a site in the studied set of sequences),
the number of different nucleotides, the absolute number
of each of the four nucleotides (G, A, C, and T) or the
number of deletions or insertions, and their frequencies
(in percentages). We tabulated site variability as the pro-

Test of SVARAP on VGS groESL sequences
SVARAP was used on Viridans Group streptococci (VGS)
groESL sequences. VGS are examples of bacteria for which
it is important to accurately identify the species. Indeed,
they are capable of causing many serious infections such
as subacute infective endocarditis, and clinical significance and antimicrobial susceptibility may differ between
species [5,6]. Teng et al. studied ten species of VGS [7].
They previously amplified and sequenced VGS groESL
gene regions using degenerated primers and LA-PCR. This
strategy failed to amplify six out of ten VGS species, and
six other primers were thus used to target the groES and/or
the groEL genes of VGS. Four primers were used to amplify
and sequence the GroES gene and four other primers were
used for the GroEL gene. They finally determined VGS
groESL full-length sequences and a strategy for VGS identification using groES, groEL and the intergenic region
(spacer) between the groES and groEL genes. Then, they
studied nucleotide sequence similarity scores between
VGS species in the GroES and GroEL genes. We investi-

gated if better strategies to amplify and differentiate VGS
could be obtained using SVARAP. We used all of the
sequences determined by Teng et al. and the groESL
sequence from Streptococcus pneumoniae, which was also
analysed by these authors [7]. Sequences were obtained
from the GenBank sequence database. The accession
numbers were as follows: Streptococcus anginosus,
AF378195; Streptococcus constellatus, AF378196; Streptococcus intermedius, AF389515; Streptococcus sanguis,
AF378197; Streptococcus gordonii, AF338228; Streptococcus
oralis, AY38047; Streptococcus mitis, AF417589; Streptococcus bovis, AF389514; Streptococcus mutans, AF389516;
Streptococcus salivarius, AF389517; Streptococcus pneumoniae, AF117741. Sequences comprised between 1,963 and
3,666 nucleotides and were processed using ClustalX and
SVARAP as described above. Then, regions were chosen
for their variability features after visual analysis of the
graphics produced by SVARAP. Nucleotide variability for
both windows of 25 and 50 nucleotides and site by site
were considered. A more precise analysis was also possible
to be performed using numerical data available in tables.
When starting from ClustalX GroESL sequence alignment,
less than fifteen minutes were necessary to obtain the
results provided by SVARAP – this time mostly consisted
in formatting the GDE sequence alignment generated by
ClustalX to make it fit with SVARAP processing. The interpretation of SVARAP results was then performed in only
fifteen more minutes. Three interesting sites for primer
hybridization were clearly revealed and easily visualized
on the plot representing the mean variability for sliding

windows of 25 nucleotides (Figure 1). They were the most
conserved with mean variability ranging from 4 to 7%.
Moreover, they bordered two very polymorphic regions
with mean variability reaching 27% for the first nucleotide region (R1) and 22% for the second nucleotide
region (R2). R1 (up to 371 nucleotides) partially includes
the groES gene in its 3' region and the intergenic region
between groES and groEL. R2 (159 nucleotides) is located
in the groEL 5' region. SVARAP site-by-site analysis
showed precisely the location of variable positions in the
putative primer binding sites, their level of variability, as
well as the number and nature of nucleotides harbored.
The sequences of the three primers were as follows:
SVARAPfwd1:
5'-AAACCMTTRGGNGAYCGWRTSST;
SVARAPrev1/SVARAPfwd2:
5'-TGKCAAAAGAHATTAAATTTTCA; SVARAPrev2: 5'-GAAGAYCAYTTTGAAAAYATGGG.
In the groEL gene, the primer binding sites underlined by
SVARAP for amplification and sequencing of VGS are less
degenerated than those targeted by Teng et al. despite having been designed to hybridize with all eleven VGS species
[7]. The R2 forward primer SVARAPfwd2 has two (8.6%)
degenerated positions out of 23, involving two and three
different nucleotides. The R2 reverse primer SVARAPrev2
carries three (13.0%) degenerated sites out of 23, involving two different nucleotides each. In comparison, the
two primers used by Teng et al. for clinical isolates and in
a first step for VGS reference strains carried six (23.1%)
degenerated positions out of 26 for the forward primer, all
corresponding to N, and eight (30.8%) out of 26 for the
reverse primer (all but two corresponding to N) [7]; moreover, they failed to amplify six out of the ten VGS reference
strains and two others primers were used to obtain the full
length or near-full length sequence of the groEL gene; they
included three (14.3%) and four (16.0%) degenerated
positions. Overall, in the groEL gene, the number of
degenerated sites was significantly lower for R2 primers
pair compared with the one used by Teng et al. (5 vs. 14;
p = 0.046). For the groES gene, four primers were designed
by Teng et al.. The sequences of two were available and
comprised three (14.3%) degenerated positions for the
reverse primer and no degenerated site for the forward
primer. Two other primers were designed to amplify the
entire groES sequence and the groES-groEL spacer region.
The R1 forward primer SVARAPfwd1 carried eight
(34.8%) degenerated positions out of 23. However, in
seven cases they involved only two nucleotides. Of note,
if the two sequences of S. mutans and S. salivarius were
excluded, the number of degenerated positions would
decrease to three (13.0%). The R1 reverse primer
SVARAPrev1 corresponds to primer SVARAPfwd2 which
comprises two (8.6%) degenerated positions. Finally,
SVARAP strategy would use two primers, and could target
either the groES or the groEL region.

using SVARAP to discriminate between the different VGS species. a For sequences obtained by Teng et al., the numbers of nucleotide differences among VGS species were calculated based on the nucleotide sequence similarities and the
sequence lengths published [7]. b Partial groES-including sequences chosen using SVARAP (R1) were analysed to calculate
sequence similarities considering or not considering positions in the alignment where at least one sequence does not harbor a
nucleotide (gaps).

On the other hand, based on nucleotide sequence similarity scores between the eleven reference strains of VGS
described above, R1 was more polymorphic than the
groEL region analysed by Teng et al. (mean nucleotide
sequences similarity scores between species of 69.7%
(range: 48.0–96.8) vs. 81.7% (range: 77.2–95.2); p < 103), whereas it showed a tendency for higher variability
than groES full-length sequences (73.3% (range: 62.1–
95.1); p = 0.083) (Figure 2a). Also, the proportion of
nucleotide sequence similarity scores between VGS species that were <80% was significantly higher in R1 than in
Teng et al's groEL region (87.3% vs. 38.2%; p < 10-3).
When analyzing the mean number of inter-species nucleotide differences, R1 was significantly more discriminant
than groES full-length region used by Teng et al. (113
nucleotide differences (range: 12–193) vs. 77 (range: 14–
109); p < 10-3) (figure 2b). Moreover, R1 includes groES

and groEL intergenic spacer that vary according to the species in sequence and in length, ranging from 15 to 111
nucleotides [7]. R2 is also a very interesting region for differentiation of VGS species. Very conserved primer binding sites border it and it is a very short sequence. Fifty-four
(98.2%) of the sequence comparisons of VGS species
retrieved more than 10 nucleotide differences, and 51
(92.7%) retrieved more than 20 differences. The GroEL
region studied by Teng et al. displayed significantly more
nucleotide differences among VGS species than R2 and R1
(p < 10-3) (Figure 2b), but this is due to its length that
overruns 1,500 nucleotides. In fact, this is a strong drawback because, at the present time, routine sequencing
assays produce, in a single run, sequences of a maximum
length of 600 nucleotides. Conversely, R1 and R2 (up to
417 nucleotides for R1 and 205 nucleotides for R2,
including primers) would be easily sequenced. With

regard to R1 and R2 phylogenetic analysis, species within
a VGS group were found to be highly related, as found by
Teng et al.: for example, S. anginosus, S. constellatus and S.
intermedius were highly related (bootstrap values of 97
and 93 for R1 and R2, respectively), as were S. mitis, S. oralis and S. oralis (bootstrap values of 97 and 100 for R1 and
R2, respectively).
Test of aSVARAP on HIV-1 RT sequences
The version of SVARAP dedicated to analysis of variability
in amino acid sequences, called "aSVARAP", was used in
the setting of HIV-1 infection. Genotypic testing of resistance to antiretroviral compounds is recommended in
clinical practice to guide the therapeutic management of
HIV-1-infected patients [8]. This corresponds to the
amplification and sequencing of the reverse transcriptase
(RT) and protease coding regions in HIV-1 genome. RT is
one of the two enzymes targeted by antiretrovirals (ARV)
available to date [9]. Knowledge of amino acid changes,
especially under the selective pressure of antiretroviral
therapies, usually requires large-scale studies and clinical,
virological, and immunological results together with HIV
genotypic and phenotypic susceptibility data. We sought
to evaluate if aSVARAP was a reliable tool to characterize
the polymorphism of HIV-1 RT in the absence of drug and
to identify mutations emerging under NRTI-selective pressure.

HIV-1 RT coding regions from 29 HIV-1-infected patients
who had never received antiretroviral therapy and 100
HIV-1-infected patients who had been exposed to various
combinations of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) were studied. The treated patients who were
selected were the first 100 in alphabetic order for whom a
genotypic testing of resistance to antiretrovirals was prescribed during the previous year. The untreated patients
who were selected had been recently HIV-diagnosed. All
sequences were obtained from our HIV sequence database
[10]. Sequences comprised 717 nucleotides and were
processed using ClustalX and aSVARAP as described
above for nucleotide sequences and SVARAP. We studied
the 239 first codons of the HIV-1 RT gene from 129 HIV1-infected patients who were exposed or not to nucleoside
reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) (Figures 3). The
aSVARAP firstly helped to reveal that HIV-1 strains harbored areas of natural polymorphism. We observed that
99 (41.4%) nucleotide positions were variable in the
absence of NRTI-selective pressure (Figure 3a). Codons
35, 49, 83, 122, 123, 135, 167, 177, 200, 207 and 211
exhibited a variability >30% in the absence of antiretroviral therapy. In contrast, three regions from codons 71 to
82, 91 to 99 and 147 to 157 were fully conserved in the
absence of drug-selective pressure. These conserved
regions could be crucial for RT functionality and thus
appropriate targets for ARV. Secondly, when comparing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/6/21

variability in the presence or in the absence of reverse
transcriptase inhibitors-selective pressure (figures 3a and
3b), we observed differences exceeding 10% at 34
(14.2%) positions. Of the 16 positions where this difference was >20%, ten harbored previously well-defined
drug-resistance mutations (at positions 41, 67, 70, 74,
101, 103, 118, 210, 215, 219) [8] – two of which occurred
in the presence of non nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors (NNRTI) which were poorly represented in the
drug combination regimen of the 100 selected patients.
All five positions (41, 67, 74, 118, 210) where the difference between amino acid variability of HIV-1 RT from
treated and untreated patients exceeded 30% were associated with HIV-1 NRTI-resistance mutations. Moreover, we
considered positions where amino acid variability was significantly higher in RTI-treated versus naive patients (p <
0.05). Eleven positions (41, 44, 67, 69, 70, 74, 118, 184,
210, 215, 219) harbored previously well-defined NRTIresistance mutations, and four positions (101, 103, 181,
190) harbored well-defined NNRTI-resistance mutations.
Of seven other positions, four (20, 43, 98 and 203) were
highly conserved (variability <5%) in HIV-1 strains from
untreated individuals, and should be further analysed to
verify if they are not involved in drug-resistance. Seven
HIV-1 RT positions (62, 65, 75, 77, 115, 116, 151) previously described as harboring NRTI-resistance mutations
were not revealed by aSVARAP as being more variable in
treated patients than in untreated individuals. This could
be related to the low frequencies of mutations observed at
these sites in clinical practice, and indeed, they all displayed low variability between 2% and 7% under NRTIselective pressure.

Discussion
SVARAP and aSVARAP, two in-house programs, were used
in our clinical microbiology laboratory for two applications related to routine and clinical research assays. The
aim was to test their facility, rapidity and usefulness for
analysis of nucleotide or amino acid sequence variability.
SVARAP revealed two nucleotide regions R1 and R2 to
amplify all VGS and to identify VGS species. A single
primers pair could then be used for each of those two
regions. R1 is globally more discriminant with VGS species than groES full-length sequences, and tend to be more
discriminant than the large groEL region previously analysed by Teng et al. [7]. R2 is less variable but is also discriminant, and it has more conserved primer-binding
sites. Indeed, R2 primers targeting the groEL gene are significantly less degenerated than those used by Teng et al.
[7]. Moreover, R1 and R2 shortness (<500 nucleotides)
means time and cost-saving sequencing procedures. Each
could be used separately for PCR amplification and species differentiation. ASVARAP was helpful to characterize
the polymorphism of HIV-1 RT in the absence of drugs

and to identify mutations emerging under NRTI-selective
pressure, even if only 129 out of 7,000 RT sequences were
processed from our clinical database. Major data were
obtained easily and quickly without performing a largescale study, and aSVARAP revealed 11 of the 18 RT mutations that are considered in the HIV-1 genotypic NRTIresistance interpretation algorithm of the International
AIDS Society [8]. The seven mutations that were not
detected occur with very low frequency in clinical practice.
Several programs do exist that analyse variability in nucleotide and/or amino acid sequences. For instance, SWAN
performs very sophisticated analysis by estimating the variability in each column of an alignment of nucleotide
sequences as an entropy function of the nucleotide variation observed at this site [11]. It permits calculation and
representation of the first and second derivatives of variability, providing information about the regularity of

sequence variation in genomes. Several other programs
are available commercially or freely on the World Wide
Web to design primers for PCR assays. For instance, Oligo
Primer Analysis Software (Molecular Biology Insights,
Inc), which needs to be purchased, takes into account various other critical parameters than sequence variability,
including melting temperature, primer length, GC contents, or the formation of secondary structures, as hairpins
and self and cross dimers [1,12]. Nevertheless, extensive
expertise is required to take advantage of all these parameters. In contrast, SVARAP uses a very simple approach for
basic analysis of genetic variability. It reveals the most
conserved areas whatever the degree of divergence
between the studied sequences, and provides the frequencies of all different nucleotides at degenerated sites in
designed primers. Moreover, the variability of the amplified regions can also be considered. Thus, SVARAP allows
to seek at a glance for regions with high variability flanked

by conserved areas for sequence-based differentiation and
identification of various infectious pathogens.
Regarding programs that analyse variability in amino acid
sequences, the detection of mutations emerging under
drug selective pressure in HIV-1, which was performed
using aSVARAP in the present study, can be done using
the Stanford Drug Resistance Database Program
(SDRDP). SDRDP is in free access on the World Wide Web
[13], and is able to provide results based on a large
sequence database in a few seconds [14]. However, this
program is dedicated to the analysis of HIV-1 protease and
reverse transcriptase sequences, whereas aSVARAP is a versatile tool that permits to analyse any set of sequences
consisting in different regions of different infectious pathogens. Furthermore, aSVARAP is able to compare sets of
sequences in the absence or in the presence of several different selective pressures. AL2CO is another program that
analyses amino acid variability [15]. It can help to predict
functionnaly and/or structurally important sites, based on
the principle that these latter tend to be more conserved.
It attributes to each aligned amino acid position in a protein sequence alignment a conservation index that is
defined using three conceptually different approaches:
entropy-based, variance-based and matrix score-based.
Although aSVARAP performs less sophisticated analysis of
amino acid variability, it provides easy interpretable
results including the level of variability and the frequencies of the different amino acids at each position in a multiple sequence alignment.
It cannot be ruled out that, in biology, in silico studies are
not fully superposable to real practice. In fact, several
users from different departments of our clinical microbiology laboratory have tested SVARAP or aSVARAP successfully. Adekambi et al. used SVARAP in the setting of nonpigmented and late-pigmenting rapidly-growing mycobacteria (RGM), which are increasingly isolated in clinical
microbiology laboratories [16]. 16S rRNA gene sequence
analysis underestimates RGM diversity and does not distinguish between all taxa. Adekambi et al. therefore determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the rpoB gene,
which encodes the bacterial beta subunit of the RNA
polymerase, for 20 RGM type strains and they focused,
after using SVARAP, on a 723-bp variable region exhibiting 83.9 to 97% interspecies similarity and 0 to 1.7%
intraspecies divergence. The latter was further applied to
the identification of 63 RGM clinical isolates: 59 (94%)
exhibited <2% partial rpoB gene sequence divergence with
one of 20 species under study and were regarded as correctly identified at the species level. In another study,
Khamis et al. investigated the usefulness of rpoB sequencing for differentiation and identification of bacteria
belonging to the genera Afipia and Bosea which are
amoeba-resisting bacteria recently reported to colonize

hospital water supplies [17,18]. The major drawback of
rpoB sequencing is that the length of the gene (>4,000 bp)
does not allow routine molecular identification or detection in clinical samples. Conversely, SVARAP allowed the
design of universal primers for amplification and
sequencing of a 740- to 752-bp fragment containing a
hypervariable region of 408 to 420 bp for identification of
all species tested in the phylum. The version of SVARAP
dedicated to analysis of variability in amino acid
sequences, called "aSVARAP", was used in the setting of
infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 2
(HIV-2) [19]. Because of its limited worldwide spread, little data is available concerning the susceptibility of
human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) to protease inhibitors (PI) and the potential emergence of resistance [20]. Therefore, 56 HIV-2 protease sequences from
21 untreated or NRTI-treated HIV-2-infected patients were
analysed in our laboratory to identify mutations emerging
under PI-selective pressure [19]. We were confronted with
the difficulty of revealing drug-resistance mutations from
a limited number of sequences based on objective and statistical criteria. Finally, mutations were considered to be
selected under PI-containing antiretroviral regimen based
on the presence of at least the following criteria: (i) a significantly higher amino acid variability at a given position
in PI-treated versus naive patients; (ii) a statistically significant difference between the frequency of amino acids at a
given position in naive versus PI-treated patients. A significantly higher amino acid variability was found at positions 7, 62, 71, 90 and 99 in PI-treated patients than in
treatment-naive patients (p < 0.05). Moreover, the frequencies of amino acids 46I, 62A or T, 71I, 90M and 99F,
automatically calculated by SVARAP, were significantly
higher in the PI-treated patients than in the untreated
patients (p < 0.05). These drug-selected mutations were in
line with longitudinal studies of PI-treated patients in
therapeutic failure.

Conclusion
SVARAP and aSVARAP are very simple, versatile and helpful tools for analysis of genetic or protein variability. They
do not require time-consuming or extensive expertise for
manipulation or interpretation. At present, they are frequently used in our clinical microbiology laboratory by
different users for analysis of rapidly growing sequence
databases. Users mostly seek regions with high variability
flanked by conserved areas, optimal for PCR and sequencing, as well as natural polymorphism or drug-selected
mutations. However, SVARAP could be applied to various
other purposes. For instance, it could be used in multilocus sequence typing (MLST), an emerging typing method
based on sequence comparisons of multiple loci [21].
