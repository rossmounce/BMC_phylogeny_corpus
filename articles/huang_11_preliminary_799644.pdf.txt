Abstract
Background: Microbial communities inhabiting human mouth are associated with oral health and disease.
Previous studies have indicated the general prevalence of adult gingivitis in China to be high. The aim of this
study was to characterize in depth the oral microbiota of Chinese adults with or without gingivitis, by defining the
microbial phylogenetic diversity and community-structure using highly paralleled pyrosequencing.
Methods: Six non-smoking Chinese, three with and three without gingivitis (age range 21-39 years, 4 females and
2 males) were enrolled in the present cross-sectional study. Gingival parameters of inflammation and bleeding on
probing were characterized by a clinician using the Mazza Gingival Index (MGI). Plaque (sampled separately from
four different oral sites) and salivary samples were obtained from each subject. Sequences and relative abundance
of the bacterial 16 S rDNA PCR-amplicons were determined via pyrosequencing that produced 400 bp-long reads.
The sequence data were analyzed via a computational pipeline customized for human oral microbiome analyses.
Furthermore, the relative abundances of selected microbial groups were validated using quantitative PCR.
Results: The oral microbiomes from gingivitis and healthy subjects could be distinguished based on the distinct
community structures of plaque microbiomes, but not the salivary microbiomes. Contributions of community
members to community structure divergence were statistically accessed at the phylum, genus and species-like
levels. Eight predominant taxa were found associated with gingivitis: TM7, Leptotrichia, Selenomonas, Streptococcus,
Veillonella, Prevotella, Lautropia, and Haemophilus. Furthermore, 98 species-level OTUs were identified to be
gingivitis-associated, which provided microbial features of gingivitis at a species resolution. Finally, for the two
selected genera Streptococcus and Fusobacterium, Real-Time PCR based quantification of relative bacterial
abundance validated the pyrosequencing-based results.
Conclusions: This methods study suggests that oral samples from this patient population of gingivitis can be
characterized via plaque microbiome by pyrosequencing the 16 S rDNA genes. Further studies that characterize
serial samples from subjects (longitudinal study design) with a larger population size may provide insight into the
temporal and ecological features of oral microbial communities in clinically-defined states of gingivitis.

Background
Metagenomic techniques have recently revolutionized
our understanding of the plethora of microbes that coinhabit the human body, collectively known as the
human microbiome. Various body sites (e.g. the skin,
the gastrointestinal and vaginal tracts and the oral cavity) harbor distinct communities of microbes that vary
among host individuals as well as among the ecological
niches within each body site [1]. Interactions among
resident microbiota and between the microbiota and the
human host underlie human health and disease. Within
the oral cavity, the tongue, soft and hard palates, buccal
mucosa, supragingival and subgingival surfaces of the
teeth and saliva may represent different ecological
niches or habitats [2]. The composition and diversity of
microbiota in these habitats may contribute to oral
health [3-6] and oral diseases such as dental caries, periodontitis, and gingivitis [7,8].
Gingivitis is inflammation of the soft tissues of the
gum surrounding the teeth. It is believed to result from
the build-up of plaque [9] and the ensuing interactions
between the plaque microbiota and host tissues [10,11].
These tissues become erythematous and bleed upon
probing, but no apical migration of the junctional
epithelium occurs. Previous studies of gingival plaque
showed that as gingivitis develops, the microbial constituents of subgingival plaque shift from a population
dominated by Gram-positive streptococci to one with
elevated levels of Gram-negative anaerobes such as Actinobacillus, Capnocytophaga, Campylobacter, Eikenella,
Fusobactrium and Prevotella [2,12,13]. However, these
studies have been based on culture-based and molecular
methods that target only a limited and partial number
of culturable microbes, a bias that can be overcome by
metagenomic approaches. During the last decade, highthroughput sequencing approaches based on 16 S rDNA
amplicons have been used to survey the diversity of
human oral microbiota in health and disease. Notably,
these techniques revealed the microbial diversity within
the healthy subgingival crevice exceeds far beyond that
was characterized previously. Kroes et al. noted that less
than a quarter (24%) of phylotypes identified with metagenomic techniques could be recovered by cultivation
and that almost half of the subgingival phylotypes identified with a combination of molecular and culturebased techniques had not been characterized previously
[14]. In fact, another study estimated that in human oral
cavity approximately 68% of all bacterial taxa were still
uncultivated [6].
Although molecular techniques have been used to
compare subgingival plaques in healthy hosts and those
with oral diseases such as periodontitis [15], few studies
have investigated in depth the oral microbiota associated

with gingivitis. There are several reasons. First, the
depth and breadth of sampling for oral microbiota have
been insufficient in general, and the optimal parameters
not determined for that of gingivitis patients in particular. Second, regarding the selection of gingival sites for
plaque sampling, it was still not clear whether or which
of the different sites are clinically relevant (e.g., anterior
teeth or posterior teeth? supragingival plaque or subgingival plaque?). Such ambiguity severely limits meaningful
data analysis and comparisons across studies, and delays
the translation of the findings clinically. Third, most
oral microbial surveys that enumerated 16 S sequences
of PCR-amplicons have ignored potential PCR artifacts
[16-19]; as a result, a comprehensive and accurate organismal landscape of most oral microbiomes, particularly
those related to diseases, remained largely elusive. All
these factors have confounded the assessment of microbial factors associated with gingivitis.
Employing pyrosequencing of 16 S rDNA amplicons,
this article elucidated the diversity and population structure of the oral microbiota, sampled respectively from five
oral ecological niches from each of the three Chinese
adults with gingivitis and three without the disease. Microbiota of supragingival plaque, subgingival plaque, and saliva were characterized to test whether and how the
microbiomes from the various oral ecological niches distinguished healthy hosts and those with gingivitis. Our
study pinpointed a number of organisms as potential biomarkers of gingivitis, and provided important insights for
the sampling and analysis strategies for unraveling gingivitis-associated microbial risk factors in human populations.

Results
Study design

The six subjects were healthy, non-smoking adults in
age ranging from 21 to 39 years (Table 1). Group
assignment was based on the frequency of bleeding on
probing (BOP). Three subjects were assigned to the
healthy group (H) based on a BOP frequency ≤5 and
three subjects to the unhealthy (gingivitis) group (U)

of three women and Group U included two men and
one woman. Bleeding indices of the individual subjects
were shown in Table 1.
Sequence datasets

Five samples (each from a different oral site; see Methods) from each individual were collected and analyzed.
Barcoded 16 S-rDNA amplicon sequencing using 454
Titanium (average read length of 400 bp) yield a total of
494,988 raw reads, resulting in a dataset of 258,385 reads
(after stringent quality assessment and control measures;
Methods). The number of reads per sample ranged from
4,405 to nearly 13,562, with an average of 8,612 (Table 2).
Richness and diversity analysis based on Operational
Taxonomic Units

Clustering the unique sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at a 3% genetic distance resulted

in 464~737 different “species level” phylotypes per
microbiome (Table 2). For all of the oral microbial
communities analyzed, the number of OTU detected
was very close to the total number of OTU estimated
by Chao1 and ACE richness indicators. The average
level of Good’s coverage was over 97% in all samples,
indicating that about three new phylotypes would be
expected for every 100 additional sequenced reads.
This level of coverage suggested that the 16 S rDNA
sequences identified represent the majority of bacterial
members present in saliva and plaque samples in the
current study. The individual rarefaction curves
showed a similar pattern of increasing diversity that
has not yet reached saturation (Figure 1). Comparisons
of the rarefaction curves in the healthy (H) and gingivitis (U) populations for the sampled sites of saliva and
plaque showed that the two host-groups displayed
similar richness of bacterial OTUs at 97% identity
level.

Figure 1 Rarefaction curves for H and U groups at the sampled sites of saliva and plaque. For both saliva plaque microbiomes, H and U
Groups displayed similar phylogenetic diversity at 97% identity level (based on up to 4,000 sequences per sample).

To determine whether the microbiota from the saliva
and plaque distinguished healthy hosts and those with
gingivitis, multivariate analyzes were applied to compare
the overall structure of microbiota from each oral ecological niche based on FastUnifrac-derived and thetaYCbased distance matrices. FastUniFrac [20] allows pairwise comparisons of the evolutionary distances between
two microbial communities and measures similarities
among microbial community-structures. In the PCoA
analysis, under a weighted UniFrac scheme, segregation
between H and U groups was observed (p < 0.001)
when all samples or when only plaque samples were
considered, but not when only saliva samples were considered (Figure 2A). Moreover, regardless of their hostgroup affiliation, saliva microbiota formed a distinct
cluster from the plaque microbiota (p = 0.034) (Figure
2B, C). The thetaYC-based PCoA analysis showed consistent results (Figure 3A, B). When only plaque samples
were considered, the structural segregation between “H”
and “U” groups was more discriminating (p = 0.001)
(Figure 3C) than when all samples were included (p =
0.005) (Figure 3A). Therefore, gingivitis- and healthygingival-microbiomes can be distinguished based on the
distinct community structures of plaque microbiomes,
but not the salivary microbiomes.

cavity: Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and TM7 [6,21]. The relative
abundance of all plaque phyla detected in each of the
two host groups suggested that significant differences
for most of the phyla were found between hosts with or
without gingivitis, except for Firmicutes, Proteobacteria
and Spirochaetes (Figure 5). Among those gingivitisassociated phyla, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were
gingivitis-depleted while the remaining five phyla were
gingivitis-enriched (Figure 5).
A total of 70 genera were identified in the oral microbiota from the five sampled sites (Additional file 1). The
most frequently detected taxa at the genus level (the 12
most abundant genera that each represents at least 2%
of oral microbiome) were Streptococcus, Neisseria, Leptotrichia, Actinomyces, Prevotella , Veillonella, Rothia,
Fusobacterium, Lautropia, Selenomonas, Haemophilus,
Granulicatella.
Statistically, 26 genera were found differentially distributed between gingivitis plaques (Group U) and
healthy-gum plaques (Group H) (Table 3). Five genera
(Streptococcus, Veillonella, Prevotella , Lautropia and
Haemophilus) were significantly more abundant in
healthy-gum plaque microbiota than those from gingivitis plaque, while the remaining 21 genera were found to
be statistically less abundant.

Taxonomy-based characterization of oral microbiota

OTU-level comparisons of oral microbiota

Bacterial phyla and genera were identified and quantified through taxonomic assignment against reference
databases using MOTHUR, which reveal their relative
abundance in all of the plaque and saliva microbiota
(Figure 4; only phyla were shown). All sequences were
found distributed in 11 bacterial phyla that include six
predominant phyla commonly encountered in the oral

As the above comparisons on the relative abundance of
microbial taxa were derived from only those reads with
confidence value above 0.8 (Methods), essentially all
those reads without any reliable phylogenetic assignments (0.33~27.86% of the total reads in each sample)
had been masked. Therefore, we further compared,
between the two host-groups, the relative abundance of

all species-level OTUs in plaque microbiota, independently of their phylogenetic identity assignments. In
total, 98 OTUs (accounted for 5.38% of all OTUs) were
found differentially distributed at the significance cutoff
of 0.05 (both p-value and q-value of Metastats) in not
only each of the four plaque sites but in all the plaque
sites. Interestingly, among those 98 OTUs, 36 of them
were gingivitis-depleted and the remaining 62 were gingivitis-enriched (Additional file 2). Consensus taxonomy
of the OTUs was interrogated by MOTHUR based on
oral “CORE” 16 S rDNA Gene Database (Methods).
Twenty-four out of the 36 gingivitis-deplete OTUs while
57 out of the 62 gingivitis-enriched OTUs were supported by the taxonomy-assignment based results. Thus
results from the two methodologies are largely consistent. These gingivitis-depleted or gingivitis-enriched
OTUs represent a novel set of potential organismal markers for evaluation and prognosis of gingivitis, although

their validity and significance remain to be further
tested in larger human populations.
Correlation of microbial quantifications between
pyrosequencing and quantitative PCR (qPCR)

The abundances, in gene copies per ng of DNA, of two
genera (Streptococcus and Fusobacterium) in all of the
plaque and saliva samples were determined with qPCR.
The relative abundance of these two genera as determined by pyrosequencing showed a positive correlation
to the qPCR-based gene copies per ng of DNA (Streptococcus: r = 0.554; p < 0.002; Fusobacterium: r = 0.813; p
< 0.001) (Additional file 3).

Discussion
This study employed highly paralleled pyrosequencing of
16 S rDNA to assess and compare the diversity and
population structure of microbiota associated with

to that reported by Zaura et al (saliva; [5]). The Zaura
study employed a stringent and conservative read-trimming strategy, where only those reads present at least
five times in one sample were taken into analysis. In our
analysis, stringent quality-based read-trimming suggested by MOTHUR was performed, requiring average
quality score of over 35 in a 50 bp moving window
along the whole read (Methods). This conservative
selection criterion http://www.mothur.org/wiki/ significantly reduced the number of OTUs from the estimates
based on alternative read-trimming criteria such as
requiring average base quality score > 25 (data not
shown). Thus potential sequencing artifacts might inflate
the observed bacterial diversity. Furthermore, the estimated Good’s coverage showed that most of the bacterial phylotypes (> 97%) in the saliva and plaque of these
healthy and gingivitis hosts were already identified in

this study. The richness estimator of ACE and Chao1
also suggested that the majority of phylotypes (> 97%)
were already represented by the sequences in our study.
Our study firstly aimed to assess whether communities
from healthy and gingivitis-associated host populations
differ in any specific site(s) of oral cavity. Both FastUnifrac-based and thetaYC-based analysis showed that saliva and plaque samples represented distinct
microbiomes in the oral cavity. Regardless of disease status, salivary microbiota clustered distinctly from plaque
microbiota, in each of the two distance matrixes tested.
This likely reflected the different environmental conditions characterizing the two habitats. Plaque microbiota
reside in biofilms on the tooth enamel surface and are
affected by dietary composition, oral hygiene practices
[22], microbial interactions within the biofilm [8] and
interactions between microbes and host epithelial cells
[10,11,23]. In contrast, the salivary habitat was shaped
by food intake flux, transient microbiota, mucins, serous
exudate, sloughed epithelial cells, etc [3,4,24,25].

Relative abundance of phyla
Figure 4 Predominant phylotypes in each sample. Over 90% of the diversity in each sample was contributed by the six phyla. However,
variations were found in their relative abundances. See Methods for abbreviations.

Interestingly, a survey of global diversity of the human
salivary microbiome in ten individuals from each of
twelve geographic locations worldwide (including China)
reported a high diversity within and between host individuals but little geographic structure in the saliva
microbiomes [26].
Secondly, members of the bacterial communities were
identified. Furthermore, their contributions to the structural segregation of plaque microbiota between the two
host populations were evaluated. When plaque microbiota were considered at the level of phylum, Fusobacteria and TM7, two of the predominant phyla, were
more abundant in microbiota associated with gingivitis,
while Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were less abundant in gingivitis-associated microbiomes. At the level of
genus, several genera such as Leptotrichia and

Selenomonas were more abundant in gingivitis plaque
(21 such genera in total; Table 3), whereas only five genera, Streptococcus, Veillonella, Prevotella, Lautropia and
Haemophilus, were less abundant. At species level, phylogeny-assignment independent comparison of relative
abundances of OTUs between the healthy and gingivitis
hosts was performed for not only each of the four plaque sites but also all of the plaque sites. Consistent with
the above findings, 98 gingivitis-associated (both gingivitis-enriched and gingivitis-depleted) OTUs were pinpointed and found distributed in all sampled sites of
plaque. Moreover, 58 OTUs affiliated to the genera of
Leptotrichia (16), Selenomonas (12), Streptococcus (7),
Veillonella (6), Prevotella (6), Lautropia (2), Haemophilus (3) and the candidate division TM7 (6) were found
to be associated with gingivitis.

abundance of each taxon between the H and U groups were compared using Metastats (*: 0.01 <p <0.05; **: p <0.01; mean ± s.e.m).

Notably, several members of these gingivitis-associated
taxa were known to play a role in both oral health and
disease. The gingivitis-enriched genus Leptotrichia, of
the Fusobacteria phylum and Fusobacteriaceae family,
were Gram-negative non-sporing-forming, anaerobic,
saccharolytic rods. They were among the normal microbiota in the healthy oral cavity [27] and intestine [28].
Leptotrichia buccalis was found in high prevalence in a
study of the gingival crevice of Chinese patients with
gingivitis and necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis [29]. In a
model of experimentally induced gingivitis, children harbored three-fold greater proportions of Leptotrichia species and 2.3-fold greater proportions of Selenomonas
species in subgingival plaque than adults treated in the
same way [30]. Similarly, Selenomonas species are Gram
negative anaerobes normally found in the buccal flora
and associated with gingivitis [31,32] and periodontitis
[33,34]. TM7 is a prominent bacterial phylum of over
200 phylotypes without cultivated representatives
[35-37] and found in diverse environmental habitats
(such as soil, freshwater, deep sea and hydrothermal

vents). Members of the TM7 candidate division have
been recently detected in various human body sites
[6,38-40], and associated with the inflammatory pathogenesis of several diseases (periodontitis [41], vaginosis
[42] and inflammatory bowel diseases [43]). The subgroup I025 was found in subgingival plaque primarily at
diseased sites in periodontitis hosts, suggesting their
potential role in the multifactorial process leading to
periodontitis [41,44].
On the other hand, only five gingivitis-depleted genera
were detected in the current study. Streptococcus is one
of the most predominant genera in the human oral cavity. However, the “oral streptococci” are a highly heterogeneous group genetically [45]. Although most are
opportunistic pathogens and have been linked with a
variety of oral diseases [46-48], they are also considered
commensals. Similar to our results, Streptococcus sanguinis, as well as Lautropia mirabilis and Haemophilus
parainfluenzae, were recently associated with oral health
[34,47]. The genus Veillonella represents a group of
small, usually non-fermentative, strict anaerobic, Gram-

negative cocci. They are found in the human oral cavity,
the upper respiratory tract, small intestines and vagina.
In a survey of subgingival plaque from 22 subjects, the
majority of the subgingival Veillonella isolates were
identified as Veillonella parvula [49]. Prevotella species
are part of the normal human oral microbiota and are
frequently isolated from oral infections such as periodontitis, dental caries and abscesses [15,50,51]. Black-pigmenting members of Prevotella were associated with
oral diseases. Consistently, in this study, most Prevotella
OTUs detected in healthy hosts belonged to non-pigmenting species except Prevotella tannerae. Once validated in larger surveys, these gingivitis-associated
genera, including both gingivitis-enriched and depleted
ones, may represent valuable biomarkers for gingivitis.
Pyrosequencing techniques, such as the one employed
in this study, revealed vast phylogenetic diversity and
variability of bacterial communities in the human oral
ecosystem [20,52]. Characterization and quantification

of community components allowed distinctions in community structure between healthy and diseased states to
be explored for disease biomarkers and specificmicrobe-targeted therapy. To our knowledge, this is the
first organismal survey of gingivitis-associated microbiota using deep-sequencing techniques. Our preliminary findings formulate the basis for further studies that
feature a longitudinal design and include a larger number of subjects. Ongoing technical improvements on
phylogenetic-marker amplification (such as those targeting DNA-extraction bias, sequence chimerism caused by
PCR, bias of PCR amplification, sequencing errors,
unequal amplification of community members and the
typically unknown variations in the rDNA-gene copy
numbers among different residents [16-19,53]) and the
increasing coverage of oral 16 S rDNA reference databases [54] should allow the dissection of gingivitis-associated microbial factors at even higher sensitivity and
resolution.

Conclusions
This study revealed that, first, microbiota from the four
sampling sites for plaque (supragingival plaque and subgingival plaque from anterior teeth; supragingival plaque
and subgingival plaque from posterior teeth; Methods)
were similar to each other, yet were distinguishable
from salivary microbiota. Second, community structures
of plaque microbiota, but not saliva microbiota, can be
used to distinguish gingivitis. Thus plaque should serve
as the sampling site of choice in providing a microbial
perspective for the disease. Third, a number of organisms were identified as gingivitis-associated (with several
low-abundance gingivitis-specific genera detected; Table
3), which can serve as potential biomarkers. These
results have important implications in the sampling and
analysis strategies for surveying gingivitis-associated
microbial risk factors. Our findings now enable further
studies that examine the temporal development and epidemiology of microbial risk factors behind gingivitis.
Furthermore, based on the gingivitis-associated microbiota identified in this study, an integrated organismand gene-based survey of oral microbiomes at various
clinically defined states should unravel the nature of
microbial contribution to the development of gingivitis.
Methods
Study design

All oral samples were collected at the Hai Tai He Chang
Clinical Research Center in Beijing with approval from
P&G Beijing Technical Center (China) Institutional
Review Board and in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (1996 amendment). ICH Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice
(GCPs) were followed. Healthy subjects aged 18 years or
older who had a minimum of 18 natural teeth were
recruited from the Beijing area. Voluntary informed
consent was provided. Individuals meeting the following
criteria were excluded: current participation in another
clinical study; use of antibiotic, anti-inflammatory or
anticoagulant therapy within 30 days prior to examination; self-reported pregnancy or lactation; diabetes; a
history of hepatitis or blood disorders such as hemophilia or leukocythemia; the presence of orthodontic appliances or removable partial dentures; significant oral
pathology, such as advanced periodontal disease, hard or
tissue tumors, or other conditions considered significant
by the study director. Gingivitis was assessed using
Mazza Gingival Index (MGI) as defined by Mazza in
1981 [55]. Specifically, probing was performed by a dentist on the mesiobuccal and the distolingual sites of
each tooth, for a maximum of 56 sites. BOP (Bleeding
on probing) frequency and mean MGI were recorded
for each subject. The MGI is similar to the Loe and

Page 10 of 14

Silness Gingival index; both are validated indices for
describing gingivitis [55]. The merit, however, of using
MGI is that it combines measurements that address
both the signs of inflammation as well as the degree of
the severity of bleeding. Scores range from 0-5, with 0
assigned for normal appearing and healthy gingiva up to
a score of 5 for spontaneous bleeding (without provocation). Five individuals with healthy gums and another
five with extensive gingivitis were enrolled. Subjects
were assigned to the healthy group (H) if there were
less than ≤5 bleeding sites and to the unhealthy (gingivitis) group (U) when the frequency of bleeding sites was
≥ 20. No randomization among groups was performed.
Two subjects from each group did not return for follow-up examinations and were excluded from further
analyses. In the end, a total of six subjects (three in each
group) completed the full study.
Sampling procedure

Samples of dental plaque and saliva were collected in the
morning, 12 hours after evening tooth brushing. No oral
hygiene or intakes of food and drink were allowed in the
morning before sampling. Five samples were collected
from each subject: supragingival dental plaque from anterior teeth (3~4 upper incisors), denoted A-sup; subgingival plaque [2 mm below gingival margin] from the same
teeth, denoted A-sub; supragingival plaque from posterior teeth (2~3 upper molars), denoted P-sup; subgingival
plaque from the same teeth, denoted P-sub; and saliva,
denoted S. In the healthy group, plaque samples were
collected from non-bleeding sites; in the unhealthy (gingivitis) group, incisor plaques were collected from nonbleeding sites and molar plaque were collected from
bleeding sites. For unhealthy subjects, there are both
non-bleeding incisor sites and bleeding molar sites for
collecting plaque. We have considered the possibility that
samples from the bleeding sites might not represent a
complete picture of the microbiome of unhealthy gum.
Therefore, plaque samples from both non-bleeding and
bleeding sites were collected in our study.
Dental plaque samples were collected with sterile
Gracey curettes and then removed from the curettes
with a cotton-tipped swab. The tip of the swab was then
placed into 0.4 mL lysis buffer (20 mM pH 8.0 Tris, 2
mM EDTA, 1.2% Triton X-100) and vortexed for 30 s.
To collect salivary samples, subjects rinsed the mouth
with 10 mL 0.9% saline buffer for 1 min and expectorated into a 50 ml tube. All samples were stored under
-70°C before total genomic DNA extraction.
DNA extraction and PCR amplification

Bacterial pellets collected from dental plaque and saliva
were suspended in lysis buffer with lysozyme (20 mg/

Huang et al. BMC Oral Health 2011, 11:33
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6831/11/33

ml) and incubated with proteinase K. Bacterial DNA was
extracted using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR amplicon libraries of the small subunit
ribosomal (16 S) RNA gene V1-V3 hypervariable region
(Escherichia coli positions 5-534) were generated for
each individual sample. PCR were performed using the
forward primer (NNNNNNN-TGGAGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG)
and
reverse
primer
(NNNNNNN-TACCGCGGCTGCTGGCAC). Unique
heptad-nucleotide sequences (seven bases) were synthesized at 5’ end of each pair of primers as barcodes,
which helped to assign sequences to different samples.
The amplification mix contained 12.5 ul of Gotaq
Hotstart polymerase 2 × mix (Promega, USA), a 1 ul of
each primer (5 pM), 1 ul genomic DNA (0.1-10 ng μl-1)
and 9.5 ul H2O in a total volume of 25 μl. Cycling conditions were an initial denaturation at 95°C for 2 min,
25 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, at 56°C for 25 s, and at 72°C
for 25 s, followed by a final 5 minute extension at 72°C.
Samples were processed via separate PCR reactions (ABI
StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR Systems) and then
pooled. Each sample was amplified using one specific
barcoded primer. To assess quality, the PCR product for
each sample was subjected to electrophoresis (1.2% agarose, 5 V cm-1, for 40 min). Gels were stained with a buffer containing SYBR Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain
(Invitrogen, USA); DNA fragments of approximately 500
bp were excised from the gel and further purified using
Qiagen MiniElute kit. Concentrations of DNA in purified PCR products were further analyzed with PicoGreen
(Invitrogen, USA). The amplicons were pooled into a
single tube in equimolar ratios. Pyrosequencing of the
16 S PCR-amplicons was carried out on Genome
Sequencer FLX Titanium (Roche, USA) where, on average, 400 bp-long reads were produced.
Sequence processing

The sequences generated from pyrosequencing were
mainly analyzed with MOTHUR [56] for preprocessing,
identification of operational taxonomic units (OTU),
taxonomic assignment and community-structure comparisons. To minimize the effects of random sequencing
errors and avoid overestimates of the phylogenetic
diversity [57], relatively stringent quality-based trimming
of the reads was performed. First, the 454-reads were
removed if they were < 150 bp, had an average quality
score < 35 in each 50-bp window rolling along the
whole read, had an ambiguous base call (N), had any
homopolymers of more than eight bases or did not contain the primer sequence; reads were then sorted by the
tag sequences. To reduce sequencing noise from pyrosequencing data, we performed the pre-clustering step
[58] with the “pre.cluster” script in MOTHUR [56]. We

Page 11 of 14

also removed chimeric sequences detected by UCHIME
[59].
Operational Taxonomical Units (OTU) assignment and
taxonomic classification

The trimmed reads were assigned to clusters using
UCLUST http://www.drive5.com/uclust/. An in-house
perl script was used to convert UCLUST output into a
format recognized by MOTHUR [56]http://www.
mothur.org/ for further analysis. Reads were assigned to
OTUs (species-level). Calculation of coverage percentage
(Good), species richness estimators (ACE and Chao1)
and rarefaction analysis were performed using
MOTHUR [56]. The relative abundance of OTUs with
97%-identity between pair-wise samples or between
groups of samples were compared.
For taxonomic assignments, we used the “classify.seqs”
script in MOTHUR [56] to classify all trimmed reads
based on Naive Bayesian method with oral “CORE” [21]
taxonomy sequences as the reference database. The confidence score threshold was set to 0.8, such that those
with bootstrap value below 0.8 were assigned as unclassified. Relevant abundances of the bacterial taxa at the
phylum and genus level were calculated and compared.
The OTUs defined by a 3% distance level were phylogenetically classified using the “classify.otu” script in
MOTHUR [56] with oral “CORE” database [21] and a
taxonomy file describing the complete taxonomic information of each sequence in the database from domain
to species (using a 51% confidence threshold). The consensus taxonomy for each OTU was obtained in this
step.
Comparisons of microbiota community structures

FastUnifrac-based community structure comparisons
were performed [20]. In each sample, representative
sequences from each OTU were chosen by selecting the
longest sequence based on UCLUST. Each sequence was
assigned to its closest relative in a phylogeny of the
Greengenes core set [60] using BLAST’s megablast protocol. The resulting sample ID mapping file and category mapping file were used as inputs to the
unweighted and weighted FastUniFrac [20]. FastUniFrac
allows pairwise comparisons of distances between two
microbial communities in terms of the fraction of evolutionary history that separates the organisms. A distance
(a measurement of the similarity in community structure between two microbiota) was computed for each
pair of samples, both within a single population and
across the two populations, to create a matrix of pairwise distances among all samples. These distances were
then clustered to reduce dimensionality using PCoA
[61]. PCoA is a multivariate statistical technique for
finding the most important axes along which the

Huang et al. BMC Oral Health 2011, 11:33
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6831/11/33

samples vary. The principal coordinates (PC), in descending order, describe of the degree of variation that
each of the axes in the new space explains. ThetaYCbased community structure comparisons were performed in parallel with MOTHUR [56]. ThetaYC

dissimilarity between the structures of two communities
[62], where ST is the total number of OTUs in communities A and B, ai is the relative abundance of OTU i in

community B. A matrix of pairwise thetaYC-based distances among all samples was created for clustering and

Validation of 16 S rDNA pyrosequencing data by qPCR

Quantitative PCR assays on selected species were performed to test the degree of correlation with 16 S rDNA
pyrosequencing data. Two genera, Streptococcus and
Fusobacterium, were frequently identified based on our
taxonomy assignments of the reads. Therefore, we chose
two pairs of primers and probes targeting these two
genera to perform the quantitative assays for comparisons to the pyrosequencing data.
Genus-specific primers and TaqMan probes were
used, as listed in Additional file 4. The oligonucleotide
probes were labeled with the fluorescent dyes 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at the 5’ end and 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) at the 3’ end. The
specificities of the probe and primer sets for their target
DNA were tested in duplicate with the TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix. The optimized concentrations of
the forward primer, the reverse primer, and the fluorogenic probe in the 20-μl reaction volume were selected
to be 300 nM, 300 nM, and 200 nM, respectively.
Amplification and detection by quantitative PCR were
performed with the StepOnePlus™ Real-Time PCR Systems (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). For
each quantitative PCR, 20 μl reaction mixtures containing 2-μl sample DNA, forward primer, reverse primer
and TaqMan probe at the optimized concentrations (as
described above) were placed in each well of a 96-well
plate. Following the fast TaqMan thermocycling protocol, reaction conditions were set at 95°C for 20 seconds,
followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 1 second and 58°C for
20 seconds. Standard curves for each organism were
plotted in duplicate for each primer-probe set using the
Ct (the cycle number at which the threshold fluorescence was reached) values, which were obtained by
amplifying successive 10-fold dilutions of a known concentration of bacterial DNA (Streptococcus mutans
UA159 and Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum
ATCC25586). Copy-numbers of the target genes (tuf-

Page 12 of 14

elongation factor Tu and 16 S rDNA) in standard samples were calculated by the genome sizes (S. mutans 2.0
Mb and F. nucleatum 2.2 Mb) and the copy-number per
genome (one copy of tuf gene per cell of S. mutans and
five copies of 16 S rDNA gene per cell of F. nucleatum
[46,63]. One ng of S. mutans genomic DNA contains
4.63 × 105 copies of tuf gene while 1 ng F. nucleatum
genome DNA contains 2.10 × 106 copies of 16 S rDNA
gene. Based on these assumptions, the absolute copy
number of a target gene was determined by referring Ct
value to a standard cure measured on the same plate.
The relative abundance of these bacteria in the 30 different oral specimens was normalized by the absolute
quantity of DNA in the clinical samples.
Statistical analyses

AMOVA (Analysis of Molecular Variance) were used to
test whether two communities from H and U populations have the same centroid [64,65]. HOMOVA
(Homogeneity of Molecular Variance) was employed to
test whether the genetic diversity are similar between
the communities from the H and U populations [65,66].
Relative abundance of OTUs and phylotypes were
reported as mean ± SEM. Due to the small sample sizes of
these oral-site-specific datasets, features that are differentially distributed (i.e. abundant) between populations were
statistically detected using Metastats [67] via a web interface http://metastats.cbcb.umd.edu/detection.html. Frequency data of OTUs and phylotypes were converted into
a Feature Frequency Matrix as the input to this analysis
tool. To exclude the extremely sparsely-sampled features
(OTUs/phylotypes), tests were applied only if the total
number of observations of a feature (OTU/phylotype) in
either population is greater than the total number of subjects in the population (i.e. the average number of observations across subjects for a given feature is greater than
one). Metastats was performed using 1000 permutations
to compute p-values in statistical tests. We set p-value
threshold of significance as 0.05. To control the FDR
(False Discovery Rate) within the entire set of tests, we
only took those features whose q-values and p-values were
both below 0.05 into considerations. Levels of confidence
were denoted as: *: 0.01 <p < 0.05; **: p < 0.01.
In validating the pyrosequencing results, the relative
abundance of selected genera (Streptococcus and Fusobacterium) as measured via 16 S-amplicon pyrosequencing was compared to the corresponding gene copy
number as determined by qPCR. The Shapiro-Wilk statistics of the variables were statistically significant. The
degrees of correlation between the two measured parameters were determined from the Spearman’s nonparametric correlation coefficient, r. Statistical analyses were
performed with R (version 2.13.1). All reported p values
were two-sided, at a 95% confidence level.
