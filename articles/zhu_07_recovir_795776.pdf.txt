Abstract
Background: Most single stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses mutate rapidly to generate large number
of strains having highly divergent capsid sequences. Accurate strain recognition in uncharacterized
target capsid sequences is essential for epidemiology, diagnostics, and vaccine development. Strain
recognition based on similarity scores between target sequences and sequences of homology
matched reference strains is often time consuming and ambiguous. This is especially true if only
partial target sequences are available or if different ssRNA virus families are jointly analyzed. In such
cases, knowledge of residues that uniquely distinguish among known reference strains is critical for
rapid and unambiguous strain identification. Conventional sequence comparisons are unable to
identify such capsid residues due to high sequence divergence among the ssRNA virus reference
strains. Consequently, automated general methods to reliably identify strains using strain
distinguishing residues are not currently available.
Results: We present here RECOVIR ("recognize viruses"), a software tool to automatically detect
strains of caliciviruses and picornaviruses by comparing their capsid residues with built-in databases
of residues that uniquely distinguish among known reference strains of these viruses. The databases
were created by constructing partitioned phylogenetic trees of complete capsid sequences of these
viruses. Strains were correctly identified for more than 300 complete and partial target sequences
by comparing the database residues with the aligned residues of these sequences. It required about
5 seconds of real time to process each sequence. A Java-based user interface coupled with Perlcoded computational modules ensures high portability of the software. RECOVIR currently runs
on Windows XP and Linux platforms. The software generalizes a manual method briefly outlined
earlier for human caliciviruses.
Conclusion: This study shows implementation of an automated method to identify virus strains
using databases of capsid residues. The method is implemented to detect strains of caliciviruses and
picornaviruses, two of the most highly divergent ssRNA virus families, and therefore, especially
difficult to identify using a uniform method. It is feasible to incorporate the approach into
classification schemes of caliciviruses and picornaviruses and to extend the approach to recognize
and classify other ssRNA virus families.

Background
Most non-bacterial epidemic outbreaks are caused by single stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses. Typically, these viruses
undergo rapid genetic mutations that result in a large and
dynamic population diversity, which are seen as different
virus strains utilizing multiple hosts [1]. Relationships
among the strains are usually inferred through conventional homology based comparisons using complete capsid sequences or other genomic regions. Such
comparisons seek to identify clusters of similar sequences
that comprise major groups (genogroups or genera) and
sub-groups (species and serotypes). These groupings are
targeted by various diagnostics [2-13] to recognize and
classify the viruses.
Four calicivirus genera (noroviruses, sapoviruses, lagoviruses and vesiviruses) and nine picornavirus genera
(apthoviruses, cardioviruses, enteroviruses, erboviruses,
hepatoviruses, kobuviruses, parechoviruses, rhinoviruses
and teschoviruses) are known [14-18]. Further divisions
of these genera reflect more detailed sequence relatedness
among these viruses. For example, among caliciviruses,
noroviruses are divided into two genogroups GI and GII
each of which contains seven sequence clusters (GI.1–
GI.7 and GII.1–GII.7) [18-21], sapovirus sequences are
grouped into 2–5 genogroups, of which, each contains
several clusters [22-24], vesivirus sequences are known to
contain at least 40 immune response related antigenic
serotypes and lagovirus sequences cluster into proposed
sero-specific groups [25]. Similarly, the 9 picornavirus
genera are classified into several species, each of which
consists of a large number of serotypes (Table 1).
The total number of genera, species, serotypes and the
associated strains may be taken as a measure of the diversity of a given virus family. Based on this measure, the
picornaviruses and the caliciviruses are two of the most
highly divergent ssRNA virus families [14,15,17]. Within
the genomes of these two virus families, the coat protein
sequences show the lowest overall identity, possibly due
to the large number of mutations that the viruses undergo
to evade host immune responses.
The coat protein consists of a single subunit for the caliciviruses and four subunits (VP1–VP4) for the picornaviruses [15,26]. Structures of picornavirus coat protein [2731] show that the exposed parts of VP1 subunits contain
most of the important neutralization sites [29,32,33] thus
making VP1 the immunodominant regions. Additionally,
in comparison with the other genomic regions, VP1
sequences show the strongest statistical and phylogenetic
support in establishing consistent genetic and antigenic
relationships among picornaviruses [15,34]. Therefore,
VP1 sequences are most frequently used in molecular evo-

lution and strain characterization studies in picornaviruses.
Although caliciviruses appear to be relatively simpler
because of the presence of only one coat protein sequence
whose structure is known for a human and an animal
strain [35,36], experimental difficulties arise in identifying strains of human caliciviruses as these viruses cannot
be antigenically characterized due to their non-cultivability. Consequently, computational techniques offer the
most feasible ways to recognize and predict strains of
these viruses. Among the different parts of the genome,
the coat protein sequences offer the best choice in computation-based strain prediction methods in caliciviruses,
mainly because, of their highest overall variability and
antigenic correlations as compared with sequences of the
other genomic regions. This is true even for the human
caliciviruses for which antigenic relationships are often
deduced on the basis of antigen and antibody ELISAs
using expressed capsid proteins as has been done for
noroviruses [21,37-39]. We examine here a computational approach to predict strains in both picornaviruses
and caliciviruses on the basis of capsid sequences.
Strain predictions critically depend on sequence information. Most existing prediction methods for caliciviruses
and picornaviruses use sequence similarity cut-off values
derived from homology-based sequence comparisons
between target sequences and known reference sequences
[20,34]. Although recent reports indicate reliable estima-

tion of such cut-off values in distinguishing three peak
regions that correspond to the genogroups, clusters and
strains in noroviruses [40], no uniform criteria exist to
accurately estimate these values for the other caliciviruses.
Additionally, these cut-off values may be impossible to
estimate when different virus genera or families are analyzed together. These difficulties are further compounded
when only partial sequences from smaller and relatively
more conserved regions are available [12,20,41-44]. Even
for complete capsid sequences, homology based similarity scores pose limitations in determining strains of
viruses due to the exponential dependence of computation time on the sequence lengths and the number of
sequences thereby negatively impacting prediction accuracy.

evolutionary trace approaches [47]. The virus sequences,
obtained from public databases [26,48], were aligned
using ClustalW [49] in which the Gonnet-250 distance
matrix model [50] was used with penalties for gap opening, closing, extension and separation set to 10, -1, 0.2
and 4 respectively.

One approach to address the computational bottleneck is
to efficiently align sliding windows of target virus
sequences against databases of reference sequences and
use the highest overall alignment scores to genotype the
target sequences [45]. However, such methods critically
depend on parameters such as window sizes and reference
sequences. Incorrect choice of these parameters may introduce error-inducing biases while significantly increasing
the computation time due to repetitive runs using different trial values of these parameters [45].

Implementation

The topology of these trees, defined in terms of the connectivity and the relative branch lengths, was compared
with those of other trees generated using other neighbor
joining methods including the unweighted pair group
method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) distance criterion and the minimum evolution criterion using Poisson
distance models of amino acid residues as implemented
in the MEGA4 package [53,54]. Similar comparisons were
also done between the capsid sequence trees and the trees
constructed using non-capsid sequences such as those of
the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase regions or of the
non-coding regions. Because the topology of capsid trees
alone remained almost insensitive to the method used, it
was deduced that the capsid sequences were phylogenetically most robust. Therefore, any of the neighbor joining
methods could be used to draw the trees for capsid
sequences, and the Fitch-Margoliash based trees were chosen for further analysis. In contrast, the topologies of the
non-capsid trees were quite sensitive to the tree construction method used and hence, these trees were not considered.

Method
Basis
The method is demonstrated using calicivirus and picornavirus capsid sequences. Defining some of these
sequences as references, phylogeny based databases of
capsid residues that uniquely distinguish among the reference sequences were created. Residue-wise comparisons
of the input target sequences with the databases identify
those phylogenetic branches whose reference sequences
most closely resemble the target sequences. These
branches, in turn, yield the genogroup and other classification characteristics of the target sequences thereby identifying their strains.

Partitioning of phylogenetic trees yield groups of similar
sequences
The trees were divided into ten equally spaced partitions
P01–P10. The inter-partition spacing was calculated from
the maximum evolutionary distances within the trees. Ten
partitions were optimum for all trees as no significant
changes in node distributions were observed in any tree
with a further increase in partition numbers. The
sequences used to construct the trees are called "reference"
sequences and the corresponding trees are called "reference" or "genus" trees because each reference tree represents a calici or a picornavirus genus.

Phylogenetic trees of caliciviruses and picornaviruses
Partitioned phylogenetic trees were constructed for each
of the 4 calicivirus genera and the 9 picornavirus genera
following the procedure described earlier [46] based on

Each partition acts as a "similarity filter" by creating different sequence groups each of which contains similar
sequences emanating from a given node within the partition. Examples of such sequence groups are illustrated for

Thus, strain recognition methods using sequence identity
scores have not been easily amenable to reliable and
robust automation across ssRNA virus families. Based on
an earlier analysis of noroviruses [46], we describe here an
implementation of a residue-wise comparison approach
to automate strain predictions using both complete and
partial amino acid capsid sequences of caliciviruses and
picornaviruses.

The Fitch-Margoliash distance matrix was calculated for
each set of aligned sequences and phylogenetic trees were
constructed for each such distance matrix using the neighbor-joining Kitsch algorithm of PHYLIP package [51] as
implemented on the Cambridge server [52]. The mutation
rate was assumed constant throughout the tree. Each tree
was displayed with the branches horizontal, the 'root' on
the left and the tips on the right.

a hypothetical representative tree (Fig. 1a). Starting from
the root node, partition 1 contains all of the aligned
sequences. Sequence comparisons in this partition, therefore, are equivalent to conventional sequence comparisons that consider all of the sequences together. Partitions
2 and 3 are identical and contain the sequence groups s1–
s11 and s12 belonging to nodes A and B respectively. Similarly, the two nodes C and D belong to partition 4 while
nodes E and F belong to partition 5. Node C of partition
4 contains sequence groups s1 and s2 while node D of the
same partition contains nine (s3–s11) of the remaining
groups. Similarly, the eight groups (s3–s10) in partition 5
belong to node E while group s11 belongs to node F in the
same partition (Fig. 1a). Henceforth, sequence clusters or
sequence groups will be referred to simply as groups.
Comparisons among sequence groups reveal characteristic
residues within genus trees
For each tree, sequences belonging to different groups of
a given partition were separately aligned and the resulting
aligned classes were compared to obtain the consensus
residues for that partition. These consensus residues were
identified as "characteristic residues" that are conserved
within each group but not among the different groups of
the partition. For example, characteristic residue X1 at
location 1 of partition 2 of a given tree may be a conserved
Ala for Group A of node A in contrast to a conserved Gly
(X1') for Group B of node B (Fig. 1a). Such residues were
partition-wise generated for each tree.
Database creation
Entire information about the genus trees including their
partitions, all sequence groups for each partition and all
of the characteristic residues taken group-wise, were
stored in multiple 2-dimensional arrays that formed the
calici and the picornavirus databases.
Strain identification through partition-wise comparisons
To identify the strain of the input query ("target")
sequence whose genus is known, the program matches the
target residues with the characteristic residues of each
group of a given partition stored in the appropriate genus
database. This is done by first aligning the target sequence
with a database reference sequence. Next, starting with the
second partition from the root (partition 2 in Fig. 1a),
each characteristic residue of a given group in this partition is compared with the target residue at the corresponding location. Such comparisons are carried out for all
partition 2 groups. The input target sequence is assigned
to the partition 2 group with the maximum number of
matches.

The program proceeds to the next partition, where,
instead of testing all partition groups, the program tests
only those that are directly tree-linked with the most

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/379

recently accepted group. This greatly reduces the number
of groups to be searched. The process continues until all
partitions have been searched. Testing only a limited
number of connected groups per partition guarantees an
optimal tree search time, thereby making the program
computationally efficient.
Within a given partition, once input target sequence residues are matched, they are flagged as "marked" and not
considered in subsequent partitions. Exceptions to the
flagging procedure are carried out only in case of ambiguities. For example, if all of the groups in a partition show
an identical number of characteristic residue matches, an
ambiguity is declared and no match is flagged. This
ensures that all such matched residues of the input
sequence are available again for matching purposes in
subsequent partitions thereby helping resolve the ambiguity. Ambiguities may also occur when all groups within
a given partition show no matches with the input
sequence, or, if two successive partitions show identical
numbers of characteristic residue matches. In both these
cases, the program ignores the ambiguous partition(s)
and proceeds to the next one without marking any residue. This allows all of the unmarked residues in the current partition to be compared in subsequent partitions.
To illustrate the method, consider an input sequence corresponding to a known genus whose characteristic residues X1, X2 and X3 for partition 2 are Ala, Pro and Ser
respectively for group A and the corresponding group B
residues (X1', X2' and X3') are Gly, Thr and Met respectively
(Fig. 1a). If the aligned target sequence shows more
matches for X1, X2 and X3 of group A in comparison with
that of X1', X2' and X3' of group B, it implies that the input
sequence belongs to group A in partition 2 and not to
group B. Thus, residues X1, X2 and X3 are flagged and comparisons in subsequent partitions follow along those
branches that are connected to group A (Fig. 1a). The program therefore proceeds to groups C and D in partition 4
ignoring partition 3 as it is identical to the previous partition 2 (Fig. 1a).
In partition 4, if both groups C and D show equal number
of matches i.e. say, X4 and X4' are both Trp and X5 and X5'
are both Leu (Fig. 1a) and the aligned target sequence also
contains Trp and Leu at these locations, then the program
will not flag these characteristic residues but will instead
carry them over to partition 5 where these residues will
again be matched in groups E and F (Fig. 1a) to determine
which of these two groups maximally matches the target
sequence. Similar comparisons in subsequent partitions
6–10 unambiguously identify the database strain that
most closely resembles the input target sequence thereby
yielding its strain characteristics.

When the genus of the target sequence is not known, the
sequence is first compared with groups of representative
reference sequences (≤ 3 sequences per group) from each
of the genus trees in the database using ClustalW [49].
Alignment scores are computed for each group. The highest alignment score is used to select the most appropriate
genus tree from the databases. Detailed strain identification is then conducted as described earlier. The use of a
small number of representative sequences per group
ensures rapid genus determination regardless of the
number of reference sequences present in the genus tree.
Detecting recombination and spontaneous mutations
Partition-wise comparisons allow RECOVIR to detect
abrupt changes in phylogenetic sequence groupings
among trees constructed using sequences from different
genomic parts. Assuming that absence of recombination
creates similar phylogenetic relationships among
sequences from different regions of multiple sequence
alignments, these abrupt changes or incongruities indicate nodes that may possibly contain recombination sites.
For example, an abrupt change is schematically shown
using a pair of hypothetical phylogenetic trees constructed
using sequences from two different genomic regions of a
given set of virus strains (Figs. 2a &2b). A simple incongruity has artificially been built in by interchanging
sequences s1 and s10 between the two trees. Consequently, sequences belonging to nodes A and B that are
distinguished by residues (X1, X2, X3) and (X11', X21', X34')
in the two trees will not define the recombination sites.
However, subsequent nodes C, D, E and F which reflect
the incongruity between the two trees up to partition 5,
will likely define the recombination sites (Figs. 2a &2b).
For example, if nodes C and D are distinguished by residues (X4, X5, X6) and (X4', X5', X6') in one part of the
genome (Fig. 2a) and by (Y42, Y53, Y67) and (Y42', Y53',
Y67') in the other part (Fig. 2b), recombination events
must involve some of these residues to explain the incongruity between the trees. Similarly, nodes E and F that are
distinguished by residues (X7, X8, X9) and (X7', X8', X9') in
one part of the genome (Fig. 2a) and by (Y71, Y83, Y94) and
(Y71', Y83', Y94') in the other part must include the recombination sites (Fig. 2b). Similar systematic comparisons of
the strain distinguishing residues in nodes G through T of
the remaining partitions show that recombination events
can not involve sequences s3–s8 and s11–s12 as the
topology of the nodes involving these residues are identical in both trees (Figs. 2a &2b). Instead, interchange of
region 1 between sequences s2 and s9 may be a possible
recombination mechanism that leads to the incongruence
between the two trees (Fig. 2c).

In contrast, if there are changes in some of the strain distinguishing residues of a given region without changes in
the tree topology, it indicates possible spontaneous muta-

tions. Detection of possible recombination or spontaneous mutations is done manually at present as an
automated version of this feature has not yet been built
into the software.
Program testing and validation
RECOVIR was initially validated by identifying the closest
strains for five noroviruses and five enteroviruses of
known genera from their respective complete and partial
amino acid sequences of the capsids (Table 2). These
viruses were chosen because of their sequence diversity
and the availability of sequences of a large number of
strains or serotypes in public databases. The enteroviruses
included the complete VP1 sequences of Poliovirus-2
(serotype), human enterovirus (HEV)-B including the
Coxsackie viruses, serotypes of the HEV-D species and the
simian enteroviruses.

RECOVIR was further validated using more than 200
complete and partial sequences of different caliciviruses
and more than 100 such picornavirus sequences. Among
the calicivirus sequences, nearly 120 were of norovirus
strains with the remaining ones being of other caliciviruses. Of the picornavirus sequences, nearly 50 were
enterovirus partial sequences including those of echoviruses and other HEV-B serotypes [26], with the remainder
chosen from other picornavirus genera and species (Table
1). Most of the partial sequences were randomly chosen
from different regions of the capsid with some of the partial sequence lengths being only ~20% of the complete
capsid sequence lengths. All norovirus and enterovirus
sequences were selected from the NCBI databases [48].
None of the selected sequences were among those from
the program databases to minimize possible errors due to
biased sequence choices.
Software description
All functional modules of RECOVIR were written in Perl
programming language on Windows XP and the Linux
platforms. A Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) has
been designed to access all functionalities through userfriendly I/O options (Fig. 1b).
Program input and output
Input selections on the GUI have been divided into three
categories: sequence, databases and options to control
output (Fig. 1b). Any number of query sequences may be
input by either pasting them on the white board area or by
browsing one or more directories for single or multiple
sequence files. There is no limit to the number of input
sequence files. The present version reads sequences only
in FASTA format ignoring all white spaces and non-alphabet characters.

regions 1 and 2 of sequences s1–s12. The different nodes (A-T), partitions (1–10) and the hypothetical node-distinguishing residues (X1, X2, ...., Y1, Y2, ... etc.), are shown. Sequences s1 and s10 have been interchanged to create incongruous trees that
depict a simple hypothetical recombination event. (2c): Schematic representation of genomic regions 1 and 2 of sequences s1–
s10. Rectangular boxes denote the two regions. Different symbols are used to compare the two genomic regions in sequences
s1, s2, s9 and s10 that may cause incongruity between the two trees of figs. (a) and (b). Region 1 is similar in sequence pairs (s1,
s9) and (s2, s10) while region 2 is similar in sequence pairs (s1, s2) and (s9, s10). Interchange of region 1 between sequences s2
and s9 would remove the incongruity between the two trees as similar symbols will be brought together in a similar way in
both the trees. Blank boxes indicate that those sequences do not cause incongruities between the trees.
A dropdown menu in the GUI database section allows
specifying the input sequence genus, if known (Fig 1b). A
default reference sequence, used for aligning the input
sequences and for assigning the aligned location numbers
to the input sequence, then pops up in the "Select a reference" box (Fig. 1b). The default reference sequence may

be changed if required. In case the genus of the input
sequence is not known, the "unknown" option in this box
(Fig. 1b) allows the program to automatically determine
the genus and reference sequence from the built-in databases.

Input complete capsid sequences are shown in cols 1 and 2 while the input partial sequences are shown in cols 3 and 4. The corresponding closest
database strains detected by the program are shown in the last 4 cols whose headers are color matched with those of the input sequence cols. The
NCBI accession codes are enclosed within square brackets for all capsid sequences except for Norwalk virus whose PDB code is correspondingly
shown. The enterovirus capsid sequences refer to those of VP1 subunits. Abbreviations used: HEV: Human enterovirus; Cox; Coxsackievirus.

The "Run" button activates the program, displays a
progress bar of the percentage of input sequences processed and displays results in the output section of the GUI
(Fig. 1b). Depending on the "View results" options chosen, the output includes only a summary or the complete
details of partition-wise matches between the database
residues and the residues of the input sequences. Different
GUI options allow many other details of such matches to
be viewed (Fig. 1b).

Results and discussion
Strain identification of complete and partial norovirus
capsid sequences
Databases
Detailed strain identification results are described here for
selected norovirus strains among the caliciviruses and
some enterovirus strains among the picornaviruses. Complete details for the other caliciviruses and the picornaviruses can be found with the authors.

Sequences belonging to the norovirus genus tree have
been described elsewhere [46]. Briefly, these sequences
form a single group in partition P1 (Fig. 3a). Partition P2
splits this sequence group into the 2 known major genogroups GI and GII of noroviruses (Additional file 1)
[18,46]. Group GI further divides into GIa and GIb in partition P3 while group GII divides into GIIa and GIIb in
partition P4 (or P5 that is identical with P4) (Fig. 3a &
Additional file 1). Partition 6 further splits both GI and
GII groups. Group GIa is divided into GIa1 and GIa2
while group GIIa splits into 4 groups (GIIa1–a4). In partition 7, Group GIa splits into 4 groups GIa1–a4 while
GIIa3 splits further into the GIIa3_1 and GIIa3_2 groups
(Fig. 3a & Additional file 1). Groups GIb, GIIa4 and GIIb

do not split up any further in this partition. Details of the
remaining partitions P8–P10 are available with the
authors.
Characteristic residue comparisons and strain identification for
complete sequences
The characteristic residues of the norovirus genus tree
stored in the program databases unambiguously identified the closest strains of target norovirus complete capsid
sequences (Table 2). For example, comparisons of the
characteristic residue locations with the corresponding
residues of the norovirus "Seacroft" sequence (NCBI:
AJ277620) showed that the maximum number of
matches in partition P2 occurred in the aligned locations
70V and 203T of group GII and not for GI (Fig. 3a). The
corresponding GI locations were 70I and 201V respectively when mapped to the unaligned reference Norwalk
virus (PDB ID: 1IHM) sequence (Fig. 3b). Thus, the program searched only along the GII branch of the norovirus
genus tree in subsequent partitions. In partition P3, the
query sequence maximally matched the GII characteristic
residues 4A, 5S, 36V, 44P, 104A, 106G, 205S, 446I, 455P,
508R, 511N and 519F while the corresponding GI residues in the reference Norwalk virus sequence are 4A, 5S,
36V, 44A, 104V, 106N, 203A, 405L, 414F, 460H, 463D
and 471G respectively (Figs. 2a &2b). In partitions P4 and
P5, the maximum number of matches (102G, 206C,
228S, 482D, 562A) occurred in GIIa, indicating that further database searches in subsequent partitions should be
restricted only to those groups that originate from GIIa.

Of the 4 possible GIIa choices (GIIa1–a4) in the following
partition P6, the maximum number of characteristic residue matches occurred in group GIIa3 (Fig. 3a) corre-

420F, 447S, 448E and 504V of the unaligned reference
sequence (Fig. 3b). Similar comparisons in partitions P8–
P10 conclusively showed that the query sequence is most
similar to the minireovirus-like norovirus strain (Fig. 4)
Similarly, the input Appalachicola Bay, the Baltimore 'a'
and 'b' and the Boxer strain sequences most closely resembled the Chiba, minireovirus and the Potsdam strains of
noroviruses (Table 2). Strains were also correctly predicted after removing random stretches of 10–15 amino
acids from these sequences indicating thereby that the
strain prediction capability of the program is quite robust
and is independent of the locations of the input target
sequences.
Strain identification of input partial amino acid target sequences of
noroviruses
Strains of five partial amino acid capsid sequences of
noroviruses were consistently predicted using both the
"noro" and "unknown" database options of the GUI (Fig.

included the N-terminus residues while the remaining

Analysis indicates that the input sequence belongs to group/class 10 of partition 10.
This group consists of the following sequences

sequences 2JP1, 3JP2, 4JP3 and 5TP1 were from different
capsid regions (Table 3).
Despite the short sizes of the input partial sequences and
the variations in their capsid locations, the program
unambiguously recognized the strains of all of them from
their matches with the characteristic location residues.
Location 70 in partition P2 determined the major genogroup in all but one sequence. Sequences 1UK1 and 5TP1,
both containing 70V, belonged to genogroup GII while
2JP1 and 3JP2 belonged to genogroup GI based on the
corresponding 70I residue (Table 3; Figs. 2a &2b). All of
the GI residues (2JP1 & 3JP2) contained 20Q in partition
P2. However, the major genogroup of sequence 4JP3
appeared to be ambiguous as it showed features of both
GI and GII groups in partition P2 (ambiguity shown as **
in Table 3). It contained not only 70V, which is typical of
GII sequences, but also the GI-indicator 20Q. In addition,
this sequence also presented the additional ambiguity of
having an equal number of characteristic residue matches
in both GI and GII groups for partition P2 (Table 3). To
resolve this ambiguity, the program carried over the partition P2 matches of this sequence (4JP3) to partition P3.
In partition P3, the program examined characteristic residue locations 4, 5, 26, 36 and 44 for all of the sequences
(Figs. 2a, 2b). Residue 44 unambiguously confirmed the
distinction between the GI and the GII group sequences in
this partition. Sequences 2JP1, 3JP2 and 4JP3, by virtue of
44A, were all characterized as GI sequences similar to the
reference Norwalk virus sequence (Fig. 3b; Table 3). In
contrast, sequences 1UK1 and 5TP1, containing 44P, are
genogroup GII sequences. In addition, because 1UK1 has
4A and 5S and sequences 2JP1, 3JP2 and 4JP3 have 26N
in partition P3, choices of their genogroups were unambiguously confirmed in this partition (Figs. 2a, 2b; Table
3). Residue 36V, being conserved in all of the sequences
in P3, was not of much help in determining the sequence
groups in this partition (Table 3).
The program ignored partitions P4 and P5 for the 1UK1
and 5TP1 sequences due to ambiguities in residue
matches. The next partition P6 showed another ambiguity
of having more than one group with the highest number
of matches for both these sequences (Table 3). However,
matches in partition P7 clearly indicated that sequence
1UK1 belongs to GIIa1 while 5TP1 belongs to group
GIIa3_2 (Table 3; Figs. 2a &2b). Further matches in partitions P8–P10 (Table 3) confirmed that 1UK1 and 5TP1
were most similar to the Beeskow and the Bitburg strains
respectively (Tables 2, 3; Additional file 1).
Thus, the identified strain of the partial sequence 1UK1 is
consistent with its NCBI classification as a member of the
GII.4 cluster. However, 5TP1 appears to belong to the

GII.3 sequence cluster according to the present analysis
and not to GII.4 as shown in the NCBI database. Similarly, partitions P6–P10 allowed the program to confirm
that the remaining sequences 2JP1, 3JP2 and 4JP3 indeed
belong to genogroup GI (Tables 2 &3) which is consistent
with the NCBI classification of these sequences. In addition, the program determined from residue comparisons
that these sequences 2JP1, 3JP2 and 4JP3 are most similar
to the norovirus GI Chiba, Norwalk and the Potsdam
strains respectively (Tables 2 &3). Such detailed strain
information is seldom available for partial sequences in
public domain databases.

Strain detection for complete and partial amino acid
sequences of enterovirus and other picornavirus capsids
The program first correctly identified the strains for 5
complete and 5 partial enterovirus capsid sequences. The
complete capsid sequences were those of the VP1 subunits
of poliovirus, simian enterovirus, echovirus and the Coxsackievirus strains (one sequence per strain) (Table 2).
Different reference sequences were tested for use in alignment with the target sequences. The target sequence
strains were all correctly identified regardless of the choice
of the reference sequences (Tables 2 &3). As an example,
strain identification for the poliovirus strain (NCBI:

DQ841140) using the porcine enterovirus-8 sequence
(PEV-8: NCBI accession number AF406813) as reference
is briefly described. The second partition P2 of enteroviruses contains only 2 reference groups 1 and 2 in the program database (Table 4). Of these, group 2 contains only
the porcine enteroviruses (PEV) serotype 9 (PEV-9; NCBI:
AF363453) indicating that the PEV-9 strains are distinct
from the other enterovirus strains all of which (including
the PEV-8 strain) belong to group 1. This group is characterized by nine residues 40P, 42L, 44A, 46E, 48G, 72E,
124T, 125Y, 127R, 150Q, 155P, 157G, 169W, 176S, 191P,
199Y, 202F and 203Y (reference sequence PEV-8 numbering) in the database (Table 4). Because all of these residues match the corresponding locations in the target
poliovirus sequence, the program assigns group 1 to the
target sequence in partition P2 and skips the next partition
P3 as it is identical to P2 (Table 4).
The program detects the separation of group 1 into two
groups 1a and 1b in partition P4. This creates a total of 3
groups (1a, 1b and 2) in this partition (Table 4). While
group 1a contains only the PEV-8 sequences which have
independently diverged from group 1 of partition P2/P3,
group 1b contains the remaining group 1 sequences of
these partitions. Group 2 of partition P2/P3 remains unaltered in partition P4. On comparing the characteristic residues of these three groups, the program determines that
the target sequence most closely resemble group 2 in partition P4 because of the matches with residues 61L, 62Q,
78L, 106S, 115S, 131D, 152L, 170N and 174S (PEV-8

numbering) that characterize this group (Table 4). Similarly, matches with residues 43T 55G 64T 84L 156H in
partition P5 allow the program to assign group 6 to the
target sequence in this partition which contains nearly 60
other similar enterovirus sequences including those of
polioviruses (Table 4). Similarly, residue 158G distinguishes group 7 as the maximally matching group out of
the eight groups in partition P6. This group includes many
similar strains in the program database including 12
strains of different coxsackievirus serotypes, one echovirus
strain and strains of all 3 poliovirus serotypes (Table 4).
The three poliovirus serotypes, which remain clustered
with several other human enteroviruses in partition P7,
finally separate as an independent group in partition P8
(group details not shown). However, partitions P7 and P8
showed an ambiguity with reference to the input target
sequence. Both of these partitions have more than one
group having an identical highest number of residue
matches with the target. This ambiguity did not allow the
program to decide the best group in these partitions. Consequently, all group information of these partitions was
carried over to the subsequent partition P9 (Table 4).
Partition P9 contains a total of 72 sequence groups
including an independent group (#62) containing only
the poliovirus-2 strains. The program detected this group
to be the maximally matching group for the target
sequence and this detection was confirmed in the next
partition P10. Thus, the input target sequence was cor-

rectly detected as a poliovirus-2 strain (Table 4). Strains
for the remaining picornaviruses (Tables 2 &3) were also
unambiguously detected regardless of the choice of the
reference strains.
Spontaneous mutations and recombination
Spontaneous mutations
Partition-wise matches for the norovirus partial sequence
6ST1 indicated spontaneous mutations. While residue
20Q in partition P2 indicates that 6ST1 belongs to GI, residue 70V in the same partition indicates that this sequence
may belong to GII as seen for sequence 5TP1 (Table 3).
The program, therefore, checks both these possibilities for
maximum number of matches in subsequent partitions.
Each subsequent partition confirms that this sequence
indeed belongs to GI and is closest to the Potsdam strain
(NCBI accession AF439267). Therefore, location 70,
which is an isoleucine for other GI sequences (Table 3),
may be a spontaneous mutation site given the relatively
large number of matches found which, in turn, are
expected to maintain the topology of the tree. However, a
complete sequence would be required to completely rule
out the involvement of this site in recombination events.

Residue-wise comparisons may suggest that a few spontaneous mutations may be sufficient to force RECOVIR to
detect a wrong genogroup of the target sequences. For
example, it may appear that the single mutation 44A to
44P in sequence 6ST1 might switch it to a GII group
(Table 3). However, the fact that the program checks the
maximum number of matches of strain diversifying residues in each partition ensures that such single mutations
within the capsid does not randomly change the strain
type of the sequence. This is one of the major strengths of
the present method.
For the software to branch off to a different strain on the
phylogenetic tree, several mutations are usually required.
For example, if locations 11, 30 and 40 of sequence 6ST1
are mutated without changing the rest of the sequence, it
results in the synthetic GI sequence 6ST5 belonging to
group GIa1 in partition P6 instead of GIa2 that corresponded to 6ST1 (Table 3; Additional file 1). Comparisons of strain diversifying residues in further partitions
result in sequence 6ST5 belonging to a different GI cluster
than that of 6ST1 (data not shown). Thus, the present
method is able to identify spontaneous mutations that
may lead to subtle changes in the phylogenetic groups of
partial sequences.
Recombinations
Only a few enterovirus strains could be analyzed for
recombination using RECOVIR due to the manual nature
of such analysis in the present version of the software. Partition-wise comparisons of strain diversifying residues of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/379

VP1–VP3 genes of the hepatitis-A (HAV) strains at the
nucleotide and the amino acid levels indicated that the
SLF88 (AY032861) and the MBB (M20273) strains may
be putative parental strains that yield the recombinant
product strain 9F94 (AJ519487) (data not shown). This is
consistent with recent results obtained using conventional
topology comparisons of phylogenetic trees by sliding
windows across the corresponding multiple aligned
sequences [55].
Despite the limited results, it appears that the present
approach may be more efficient in detecting recombination sites than current methods which are inherently time
consuming as their accuracy depends on detailed topological comparisons obtained from multiple runs using different sequence windows. In addition, the entire
procedure must be repeated every time a new sequence
needs to be analyzed. In contrast, the present method
does not repeatedly compare phylogenetic trees using
sliding sequence windows. Instead, it efficiently performs
node-wise comparisons of the trees using a one-time created database of strain distinguishing residues.
Approximate processing times
The program rapidly identified the calicivirus and the
picornavirus strains. In typical runs on outbreak sequence
data available from public databases, it took only 6 and 9
minutes of real time respectively to identify the strains of
a number of norovirus sequences contained in 2 files. The
first file had 71 complete norovirus capsid sequences
while the second file had 117 norovirus capsid sequences
of which 22 were complete sequences while the remaining 95 were partial sequences each of which was between
75 and 85 residues long. This indicates a real time (including I/O) of approximately 5 seconds per sequence. Comparable speeds were also observed in processing mixtures
of calicivirus and picornavirus sequences when the
"unknown" database option (Fig. 1b) was required. Complete benchmark details of such strain identification runs
are available with the authors.
Advantages of the software
Trees based on complete capsid sequences are robust
A significant computational advantage of using complete
capsid sequences to construct the RECOVIR databases is
that these databases are very robust with respect to the
method used to construct the database trees. The overall
topology of the trees, described by the relative branch
lengths and the connectivity among the branches, remain
essentially unchanged regardless of the neighbor-joining
method used to draw the tree. For example, in all of the
trees constructed using the complete capsid sequences,
the sequence groups and the characteristic residues of the
groups remain unchanged for partitions P2–P9. Only the
P10 sequence groups show minor changes depending on

Page 13 of 17

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:379

the tree construction method used (data not shown but
are available with the authors). Consequently, strain identification results using RECOVIR are very reliable.
In contrast, trees constructed using a partial capsid
sequences or using amino acids of more conserved and
relatively smaller non-capsid regions (such as the
polymerase or the non-coding parts of the virus genomes)
are relatively unstable because the topology of these trees
critically depend upon the method of tree construction.
Therefore, databases generated from such trees are not as
reliable as the ones generated using trees of complete capsid sequences.
Tree-structured databases
The partitioned residue databases in RECOVIR confer
important advantages to this software over existing
homology-based strain identification techniques. Because
each partition and its nodes highlight branching orders
that provide evolutionary context of sequence relationships, the databases in RECOVIR most likely indicate biologically significant residues as seen for the noroviruses
[46].

More practically, searches using the database residues are
able to show increasing similarities between the target
sequences and appropriate database sequences as subsequent partitions are considered. Consequently, ambiguities in strain identification, such as those occurring due to
the partial nature of the sequences or those due to possible mutations in the target sequences, may be resolved at
least in the first few partitions where appropriately
matched sequence groups are found. Such matches are
not possible using conventional homology based
sequence comparisons.
Advantages in classification
Residues of the RECOVIR databases may be used to determine relatedness among the corresponding sequence
groups in a partition-dependent manner thus helping in
virus classification. For example, while the database residues of P2 distinguish among two of the major norovirus
groups and the murine norovirus group, the corresponding residues in subsequent partitions distinguish among
the more closely related sequence groups. Such residuebased distinctions among the sequence groups provide
useful ways to uniquely identify many tentatively classified sequences like those of the bovine and the alphatron
noroviruses.
Bovine and the alphatron norovirus groups
Our earlier analysis had indicated that the bovine noroviruses may belong to genogroup I while the alphatron-like
sequences may belong to genogroup II [46]. One way to
understand this is to compare the inter-group evolution-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/379

ary distances, measured in evolutionary units (eu),
between GI, GII and the groups containing the bovine and
the alphatron sequences. These distances refer to the
number of mutations among the sequences. In trees constructed using neighbor-joining methods and Gonnet250 distance matrices, the GI-GII distance, calculated
between the GI and the GII groups after excluding the
bovine sequences, is 0.20919eu while the corresponding
GI-bovine distance, calculated between the GI and the
bovine groups, is 0.18303eu (Fig. 5). Thus, the difference
between these distances (0.02586eu) is less than the partition width which results in clustering the bovine
sequences together with the GI sequences in the same P2
group. Similarly, the GI-GII distance, calculated after
excluding the alphatron-like sequences, is more than the
GII-alphatron distance calculated between the GI and the
alphatron groups thereby clustering the alphatron-like
sequences in the GII group of partition P2. Thus, the phylogenetic distances are consistent with the proposal that
the bovine sequences appear to share sequence similarities with the GI genogroup while the alphatron sequences
share GII sequence features [46].
These relative phylogenetic distances among the sequence
groups may be further understood by comparing the
sequences of the P2 groups. On aligning the three different P2 sequence groups, the conserved residues among
the bovine sequences show significant similarities with
those of the GI sequences but not with the conserved
sequences of GII. For example, the conserved GI residues
45T, 46A, 47G, 48Q, 49V and 50N (Norwalk virus numbering) are also conserved in the bovine sequences (Fig.
6). Similarly, the alphatron sequences show more residue
similarities with the GII sequences than with those of GI
(Fig. 6). Such similarities are further confirmed in subsequent partitions P3–P10 of RECOVIR. Therefore, the software places the bovine-like sequences in GI and the
alphatron-like sequences in the GII group. Although these
assignments are consistent with our earlier analysis [46],
they do not agree with recent sequence clustering studies
that assign independent genogroups to the bovine and the
alphatron sequences [40]. Experimental determination of
the possible biological roles of the conserved residues
(Fig. 6) will help resolve the issue.
Other advantages
Many of the RECOVIR database residues are involved in
putative capsid related functions in noroviruses [46]. This
indicates that these residues and the corresponding
sequence groups may critically identify subtle changes in
capsid related functions among the genogroups, species
and serotypes. Hence, RECOVIR may provide functional
insights not currently available with current classification
schemes of caliciviruses and picornaviruses.

slashes indicate the bovine branches AB, CD, CE and DF that
get excluded in the tree constructed without the bovine

are enclosed within green boxes while the corresponding
changed distances are enclosed within red boxes. All other
distances remain nearly identical in both trees. The bigger
green and the red boxes at the top left hand corner of the

and the GI-GII distance in the other tree. The green square

lengths are within the values shown. The sequences used in
the trees are identical with those used in earlier analysis
(Chakravarty et al., 2005). Both trees were drawn using the
same neighbor-joining methods under identical distance
models and sequence alignment parameters as described in
the text.

Software limitations
A limitation of the present version of the software is that
the implemented residue databases may become outdated
given the rapidly increasing number of emerging strains of
calici and picornaviruses. Therefore, the databases need to
be regularly upgraded. However, upgrades should be carried out only when changes become statistically significant. In our experience, this would mean that at least 50%
of the emerging sequences must show changes in the same

Conclusion
A software package RECOVIR that can efficiently and
accurately characterize strains of the highly divergent caliciviruses and picornaviruses is described. In contrast to
current techniques that largely rely on sequence similarity
scores to identify strains, RECOVIR implements a method
indicated previously for noroviruses [46]. The software
creates partitioned databases of capsid residues that
unambiguously distinguish among a large number of calicivirus and the picornavirus reference strains. Using efficient tree-based search techniques, residues of target
capsid sequences are compared with the residue databases
to rapidly identify strains of the target sequences of all caliciviruses and picornaviruses. Strains of more than 300
complete and partial capsid sequences of calici and picornaviruses were successfully identified with an average
time (real time including I/O) of approximately 5 seconds
per sequence. The method is general enough to be applicable to the nucleotide sequences of calici and picornavirus capsids thereby providing rapid and powerful
alternatives that complement current strain determination and classification techniques of these and other
ssRNA viruses.
