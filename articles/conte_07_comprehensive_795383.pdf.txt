Background: Embryonic development is coordinated by sets of cis-regulatory elements that are
collectively responsible for the precise spatio-temporal organization of regulatory gene networks.
There is little information on how these elements, which are often associated with highly conserved
noncoding sequences, are combined to generate precise gene expression patterns in vertebrates.
To address this issue, we have focused on Six3, an important regulator of vertebrate forebrain
development.

Conclusion: This report provides the first example of the precise regulatory code necessary for
the expression of a vertebrate gene, and offers a unique framework for defining the interplay of
trans-acting factors that control the evolutionary conserved use of Six3.

Progressive specification of the vertebrate prosencephalon
indeed follows this rule [1,2] and requires, among other factors, recurrent use of Six3, which is a member of the Six/sine
oculis family of homeobox transcription factors [3]. In all vertebrates, Six3 is expressed from the neurula stage in the ante-

riormost neural plate and then in its derivatives: the
developing eyes and olfactory placodes, the hypothalamic
pituitary regions, and the ventral telencephalon. In mouse
and chick, this distribution overlaps with that of its closely
related homolog, namely Six6 [3]. However, with time Six3
and Six6 expressions progressively segregate to different
brain regions, and Six3 - but not Six6 - is additionally
expressed in the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, midbrain, and cerebellum [4]. Consistent with this
expression, Six3-null mice die at birth, lacking most of the
head structures anterior to the midbrain, including eyes [5],
and mutations in SIX3 have been found in humans affected

Embryonic development is coordinated by networks of evolutionary conserved regulatory genes that encode transcription
factors and components of cell signaling pathways, which in
many instances are repetitively exploited in space and time to
generate appropriate outcomes in target cells.

Background

refereed research

Results: Using computational analysis and exploiting the diversity of teleost genomes, we identified
a cluster of highly conserved noncoding sequences surrounding the Six3 gene. Transgenesis in
medaka fish demonstrates that these sequences have enhancer, silencer, and silencer blocker
activities that are differentially combined to control the entire distribution of Six3.

by holoprosencephaly and aprosencephaly/atelencephaly
[6,7]. During mammalian lens induction, Six3 is essential in
the presumptive lens ectoderm to activate Pax6 and possibly
Sox2 expression [8]. In addition, morpholino-based knockdown of the medaka fish Six3 demonstrates the concentration-dependent need for the function of this transcription
factor for proximo-distal patterning of the optic vesicles [9].
Biochemical and functional studies have also shown that
Six3, as well as Six6, can induce ectopic retinal tissues and
control retinal neuroblast proliferation, acting as transcriptional repressors through the interaction with members of the
groucho family of transcriptional co-repressors [10-15]. Furthermore, Six3, but not Six6, functionally interacts with the
DNA replication inhibitor Geminin, controlling the balance
between cell proliferation and differentiation with a mechanism that is independent of transcriptional regulation [16].
How the activity of Six3 - or that of any other gene with multiple functions during embryo development - is diversified
remains to be elucidated. This could be facilitated by defining
the precise gene regulatory network that controls its spatiotemporal expression. It is now well established that control of
gene expression is executed through sets of cis-regulatory
regions within the noncoding DNA of animal genomes. These
cis-regulatory modules have variable length and contain clusters of DNA-binding sites for different transcription factors.
These modules work as promoter enhancers or silencers and
collectively constitute a unique code for the switching on and
off of gene activity [17-19].
The experimental definition of the organization of these specific cis-regulatory elements has progressed substantially in
both Drosophila and sea urchin [17]. In contrast, our understanding of how these modules are combined to generate precise gene expression patterns in vertebrates is still rather
limited. Possible causes of this are the increased genome
complexity and the slow and laborious process of testing the
functional significance of identified elements in mammals
[20]. Recently, however, computational approaches based on
multispecies genomic sequence alignments, combining both
closely related and highly divergent organisms, have facilitated identification of highly conserved noncoding sequences,
which in many cases appear to coincide with the regulatory
modules of genes that play critical roles in development.
Analyses of the complex regulation of genes such as Sox2,
Sox9, Otx2, Shh, and Irx provide some illustrative examples
[21-27]. Functional testing of 'enhancer' activity has also progressed, thanks to the use of alternative and relatively faster
'transgenic' approaches based on the use of nonmammalian
vertebrate model systems [20,25].
Here, we have taken advantage of both the power of computational analysis and the particular compact genome and high
transgenesis efficiency of the medaka fish (Oryzia latipes)
[28] to dissect the regulatory control of one of the two Six3
medaka homologs, olSix3.2, that we identified during the

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/7/R137

course of this study. olSix3.2 is more closely related to the
mammalian Six3 than the previously described medaka
homolog [29] (hereafter referred to as 'olSix3.1'). Similar to
other related studies [23-25], we identified and functionally
characterized sets of cis-regulatory modules that control the
olSix3.2 promoter, showing that at least some of these cisregulatory elements are conserved in other vertebrates,
although they are dispersed over a greater stretch of DNA.
Going a step further, we have also used combinations and
deletions of the identified cis-regulatory modules to elucidate
the regulatory code of olSix3.2, which is composed of two
enhancers, two silencers, and two 'silencer blockers' used in a
combinatorial manner. This comprehensive description of
the olSix3.2 cis-regulatory code provides a unique framework
for defining the network of trans-acting factors that control
the evolutionary conserved activity of Six3 during forebrain
development.

Results
Isolation, characterization, and expression of olSix3.2
In order to identify the elements that regulate Six3 expression
using the medaka fish (Oryzia latipes) as a model, we used
the available olSix3.1 coding sequence (AJ000937) as a query
to search public databases (see Materials and methods,
below) for the ortholog genomic loci of the closely related species Fugu rubripes, Tetraodon nigroviridis, and Danio rerio
(zebrafish). This search retrieved four different loci, one for
the fugu and the tetraodon, and two for the zebrafish (six3a
and six3b). Alignment of about 20 kilobases (kb) of the
retrieved sequences upstream of the Six3 translational start
sites identified a cluster of conserved noncoding blocks
roughly contained within the first 4.5 kb (data not shown). In
the case of the zebrafish, alignment of the six3a or six3b loci
yielded comparable results. This information was used to
amplify from genomic DNA a fragment of the medaka Six3
locus that contains the corresponding conserved noncoding
blocks and the entire first exon.
Interestingly, nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignment
of the partially amplified olSix3 coding region did not completely overlap with that reported for the previously identified
olSix3.1 [29] but identified - as in zebrafish and Xenopus
[30,31] - a second Six3-related gene in the medaka genome,
namely olSix3.2 (AM494407).
Cloning and sequencing of the entire olSix3.2 coding region
revealed a two-exon structure, similar to that of olSix3.1 and
the mouse Six3, in which the first exon encodes the Six and
homeobox domains. olSix3.1 and olSix3.2 exhibited 76% and
63% identity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. Interestingly, comparison of the amino acid sequence
(81% versus 59%; Additional data file 1) and genomic organization, together with phylogenetic analysis (Additional data
file 2), demonstrated that olSix3.2 was more closely related to
the mammalian Six3 than the previously identified olSix3.1,

telencephalon and optic vesicles (panels d to i), although olSix3.1 is more
abundant in the optic vesicles (panels d and g) and olSix3.2 in the
telencephalic region (arrowheads in panels e and h). From St22 onward,
when olSix6 mRNA also becomes detectable, the three genes are coexpressed, albeit at different levels, in the developing neural retina, optic
stalk, and pre-optic and hypothalamic area (panels j to r). In addition,
olSix3.2 is distributed in the developing lens, olfactory pits (panels k and n;
arrow), telencephalon, and anterior and posterior thalamus (panels k, n,
and q). During retinal neurogenesis, olSix3.2 and olSix6 are restricted to
the retinal ganglion and amacrine cells (panels t and u), whereas olSix3.1 is
restricted to the inner nuclear layer (panel s).

refereed research

Owing to selective pressure, functional elements in genomes
evolve at a slower pace than nonfunctional regions [36-39]. A
number of recent studies have functionally demonstrated
that a proportion of the highly conserved noncoding regions
present in vertebrate genomes correspond to regulatory elements with enhancer activity [21,39]. We therefore asked
whether the region containing the cluster of ten highly conserved noncoding elements was necessary and sufficient to
control the entire expression of olSix3.2.

On the basis of this expression pattern, we next searched for
the elements that could be involved in the regulation of
olSix3.2 expression. Alignment of the amplified olSix3.2
genomic sequence with the corresponding sequences from
fugu, tetraodon, and zebrafish (analyses involving six3a and
six3b yielded similar results) identified ten conserved noncoding blocks within the 4.5 kb upstream of the translational
start site olSix3.2 (Figure 2a).

In conclusion, the distribution of olSix3.2 appeared closely
related to that reported for the chick and mouse Six3
[4,32,33], whereas the combined expression patterns of
olSix3.1 and olSix6 resembled that reported for Six6 [34,35].

olSix3.2

comment

olSix3.1 is expressed in the anterior embryonic shield and the
developing eye [29]. To determine whether the newly identified gene and the initially identified homolog had similar distributions, we compared the expression domain of olSix3.2
with those of olSix3.1 and the related olSix6 [13] using wholemount in situ hybridization. As for olSix3.1, olSix3.2 was first
detected in the anterior neural plate at late gastrula stages but
was additionally expressed in the anterior axial mesoderm at
St16 (Figure 1a-c). At the optic vesicle stage, both olSix3.2 and
olSix3.1, but not olSix6, were expressed in the forebrain.
However, although olSix3.2 was more abundant in the presumptive telencephalon (Figure 1e,h), olSix3.1 was predominant in the optic area (Figure 1d,g). This distribution was
more evident at later stages of development, when both
olSix3.1 and olSix6, which first appears at the optic cup stage
(Figure 1l) [13]), were strongly expressed in the developing
neural retina, optic stalk, and preoptic and hypothalamic
areas (Figure 1j,l,m,o,p,r). In contrast, olSix3.2 mRNA was
distributed in the developing lens, olfactory pits, telencephalon, neural retina, anterior hypothalamus, and anterior
and posterior thalamus (Figure 1k,n,q). During retinal neurogenesis, olSix3.1 was mostly confined to the inner nuclear
layer (Figure 1s), and olSix3.2 and olSix6 to the retinal ganglion and amacrine cells (Figure 1t,u).

Conte and Bovolenta

To this end we fused this 4.5 kb genomic region, including the
first nine nucleotides of the coding sequence, in frame with a
nuclear EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) reporter
(Figure 2b). This construct, containing the ten conserved
noncoding blocks (termed A-L; Figure 2b), was used to generate three independent stable transgenic medaka lines,
which all exhibited a spatio-temporal distribution of the
reporter virtually identical to that observed for the endogenous olSix3.2 both at embryonic (compare Figure 1 with Figure 2c-n) and adult stages (not shown). We thus concluded
that this region was sufficient to control the entire expression
of olSix3.2.
In addition to regulatory elements, sequence conservation
could reflect the existence of natural anti-sense mRNAs [40]
or of alternative and yet uncharacterized exons of Six3. However, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) analysis and in situ hybridization studies excluded
these possibilities (data not shown). We thus assumed that
the ten modules, identified on the basis of their conservation
among teleosts (the precise nucleotide sequence of each module is provided in Additional data file 3), could all potentially
contain elements that are involved in the regulation of
olSix3.2. To test whether this assumption was correct, we
generated a series of constructs (named cI to cXXVII) carrying different combinations of the A-L modules, which were
then functionally assayed by generating and analyzing three
independent stable transgenic lines for the vast majority of
the constructs. In each case, the pattern of expression of the
EGFP reporter was compared with that observed with construct I (cI), containing the full 4.5 kb sequence (Figure 2i-n)
and was always consistent with that observed in F0 injected
embryos.
Embryos of a transgenic line carrying a construct in which the
A to C modules had been deleted (cII; Figure 3a) showed a
pattern of EGFP expression in the anteriormost neural tube
similar to that observed with cI. However, embryos consistently exhibited an additional transient expansion of EGFP
distribution to posterior mesencephalic regions (compare
Figure 3e,f with Figure 2i,j and Figure 1h,k), which disappeared after St22. EGFP fluorescence was also consistently
observed in the spinal cord starting from St34 (Figure 3d,g)

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/7/R137

up to adult stages. These observations suggested that, presumably, blocks D to L were sufficient to control normal
olSix3.2 expression, whereas the A to C modules contained a
silencer(s), the activity of which was necessary to restrain
olSix3.2 expression to anterior domains of the neural tube
throughout development. To determine the location of the
silencer activity, we generated and functionally analyzed
three different constructs containing the D to L modules in
combination with the A, B, or C block (cIII to cV; Figure 3a).
Only the presence of 134 base pairs (bp) of the A module could
repress the posterior EGFP expansion, restoring the normal
olSix3.2 distribution, which clearly identified the presence of
a cis-regulatory silencer(s) in this sequence. In spite of
sequence conservation, the B and C blocks instead did not
appear to contribute to the spatio-temporal control of
olSix3.2, at least in the context that we tested.

Early expression of olSix3.2 in the anterior neural
structures depends on one enhancer, whereas that in
the lens placode requires the additional activity of four
cis-regulatory modules
We then sought to determine the functional relevance of the
remaining D to L conserved modules. To this end we generated a series of additional constructs (named cVI to cXXII;
Figure 4a) based on selective deletion of one or more modules
at the time or by including different combinations of a few of
them. Transgenesis analysis of these constructs demonstrated that the D module was necessary (cVI to cXVII; Figure
4a,c) and sufficient (cXIX; Figure 4a,e) to drive EGFP expression in all of the anterior neural structures from St16 to St23.
In contrast, the D module was necessary but not sufficient
(cXIX; Figure 4e) to control EGFP expression in the lens placode/lens vesicle, as normally observed for the endogenous
olSix3.2 (Figure 4b). Indeed, the activity of modules E to H
was further required for EGFP expression in the lens (cVI and
cXVIII; compare Figure 4d with Figure 4e), because deletion
of either one of them was sufficient to abrogate the reporter
expression in the lens ectoderm (cXIX to cXXII; Figure 4a,e),
suggesting that multiple cis-regulatory sequences spread
along these four modules contribute to olSix3.2 expression in
this tissue. This is somewhat in contrast with the apparently
simpler regulation of olSix3.2 distribution in the early neural
tissue, which mostly depends on the D block.

absence of EGFP expression was observed in the cVIII to cXVII transgenic lines, all of which lack module D. Note also that the combination of modules D

Notably, modules D to H (cXVIII; Figure 4a) were also sufficient to induce caudal expansion of reporter expression, with
a pattern identical to that observed in the absence of the A
module (Figure 3e-g), indicating that modules I and L do not
contribute to this expansion or to early expression of the gene.

During organogenesis, appropriate expression of
olSix3.2 requires the combined activity of two silencers,
one enhancer, and two putative 'silencer blockers'
To determine whether these last two modules were functionally relevant to any other aspect of olSix3.2 expression, we
designed a number of constructs in which modules I and L
were assayed separately (cX and cXI), in conjunction (cIX),
and combined with the olSix3.2 endogenous promoter (cX) or
with the minimal tyrosine kinase promoter (cXI). Injections
of cX were not associated with EGFP expression in any region
of the embryo at any stage (Figure 4a). This indicates that, as
in the case of modules B and C, the L block had no enhancer
silencer activity relevant to the regulation of olSix3.2, at least
in the tested conditions, although its sequence is strongly
conserved among all vertebrates. In contrast, the activity of
block I was clearly linked to control of olSix3.2 distribution in
the forebrain starting from St26 onward, when EGFP was
gradually observed, with progressively increasing intensity,
first in the telencephalic, then in the hypothalamic, and
finally in the thalamic region (Figures 4a and 5c). This recapitulates the endogenous expression of the gene (Figure 1q).
To determine the minimal region of module I involved in the
control of this expression, we engineered five 5' to 3' stepwise
deletions covering the entire module (cXXIII to cXXVII; Figure 5a). Notably, deletions two, three, and four resulted in
progressive abrogation of EGFP expression in the thalamic,
hypothalamic (Figyre 5b-d), and telencephalic regions (not
shown). This strongly suggests that module I contains a 5' to
3' organized succession of cis-regulatory elements that control the posterior to anterior spatio-temporal organization of
olSix3.2 expression in the developing brain. This interpretation was further supported by the injection of two internal
deletion constructs (cXXVIII and cXXIX) in which the
stretches of nucleotides apparently responsible for hypothalamic and telencephalic expression were removed from cXXIII (Figure 5a). Indeed, in 11% (close to transgenic efficiency)
of the embryos analyzed in F0, EGFP fluorescence was not
detected in the telencephalon (cXXVIII; Figure 5f) or in the
hypothalamus and telencephalon (cXXIX; Figure 5g), clearly

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/7/R137

indicating that deleted elements are the main driver of
olSix3.2 expression in these regions.
The elements contained in the I module appeared to suffice in
terms of regulating late olSix3.2 embryonic expression in the
brain. Nevertheless, we considered whether any additional
module could modify their activity. Transgenic embryos carrying cXIV, in which the G module was combined with the I
module, had no reporter expression in the brain (Figure 4a),
raising the possibility that the G module contained a 'silencer'
that, in turn, could be normally regulated by a 'silencer
blocker', as previously proposed [41,42]. Addition of the H
block (cXII) proved that this was the case, because its presence restored reporter expression, although only from St26 to
St32. Further addition of the E block (cVII, containing E, G,
H and I) appeared to overcome the effect of the G silencer
from St32 onward. Thus, proper regulation of late olSix3.2
embryonic expression requires the participation of five different modules - one enhancer, one silencer, and two silencer
blockers - in addition to the silencer activity contained in the
distal A module (Figure 6c,d).
When tested alone, block I did not drive EGFP expression in
the differentiating retina, whereas activity of the D block was
sufficient to maintain reporter expression only in the prospective neural retina (Figure 4a,d,e). Thus, olSix3.2 expression in the differentiating retina appeared to depend on a
combination of modules different from those tested thus far.
The search for this code demonstrated that only the combined
activity of the E to I modules (cVII; Figure 4a) was effective in
supporting EGFP expression in the late developing retina.

Identification and characterization of conserved
regions among vertebrate
Altogether these data provide a detailed picture of the regulatory code that governs olSix3.2 expression during eye and
brain development in medaka. As summarized in Figure 6,
this spatio-temporal code is provided by the combined use of
at least seven different modules, all conserved among fishes,
with distinct enhancer, silencer, or silencer blocker activities.
The next logical question was whether this regulatory organisation was conserved in the Six3 locus of vertebrates other
than fishes.
To address this problem, we used the characterized olSix3.2
regulatory region as a query to search public databases

Summary of the regulatory code that control the entire expression of olSix3.2
Summary of the regulatory code that control the entire expression of olSix3.2. (a) Early expression of olSix3.2 in the forebrain and eye depends on
enhancers in module D and a silencer activity (activities) in module A. (b) olSix3.2 expression in the lens placode requires multiple elements distributed
along modules D to H. (c) During organogenesis, correct olSix3.2 expression requires the activity of different enhancer arranged in a 5'to 3' mode within
module I. The activity of I is repressed by module G, which, in turn, is neutralized initially by module H and at later stages (d) by the combined activity of
the E and H silencers. Module A is necessary at all stages analyzed to prevent reporter expansion to caudal central nervous system.

(Genome Bioinformatics UCSC [University of California,
Santa Cruz]) for the ortholog regions in vertebrates other
than fishes. This analysis showed that only part of the modules identified in teleosts were conserved among all vertebrate phyla (Figure 7a). Attempts to align each of the A to F
modules separately and enlarging the search to the 120 kb
flanking Six3 in the Xenopus laevi, chicken, mouse, and
human genomes were unsuccessful in detecting alignable
sequences using the VISTA and multialign software [43,44].
Thus, only the G and L modules were highly conserved and
similarly organized in all genomes, whereas the sequences
that constitute the H and I modules in fishes were conserved
but fragmented in a larger stretch of DNA in the other
genomes analysed (Figure 7b), with the exception of the marsupial opossum, in which the I block was co-linear with that

of fishes (data not shown). In spite of fragmentation, transgenic embryos, carrying the human sequence that included
the G module and the dispersed H and I sequences (Figure
7c), exhibited spatio-temporal EGFP expression in the developing brain identical to that observed in the equivalent
medaka genomic region (Figure 7d-i). In addition, reporter
expression was observed in the lens placode/vesicle. This
suggested that although control of at least part of Six3 expression in the brain has been conserved, its regulation during
lens development has undergone a reorganization of the
appropriate cis-regulatory elements during evolution (data
not shown).
Although the human construct (h-cI) we injected drove EGFP
expression only in the late olSix3.2 expression domain,

The availability of different genome sequences and the development of analytical bioinformatic tools have facilitated
study of cis regulation of a number of genes with evolutionary
conserved roles in vertebrate embryonic development. Some
of these studies have focused, as has ours, on a specific gene
or a gene cluster, identifying enhancers that are involved in
the control of specific expression domains [21,23,25,45-49].
However, possibly because of the size of the genomic regions
that are involved, or to the laborious and time consuming use
of mice, or the limitations of chick electroporation in validating regulatory activities, these studies have mostly focused on
each enhancer as a separate entity, thus missing the effects of
possible cooperative activities. Other recent and extremely
informative studies, based on medium or small throughput
screens in zebrafish, have instead systematically tested the
autonomously enhancing function of large numbers of highly
conserved noncoding elements positioned in areas surround-

Teleosts are the most diverse class of vertebrates with a huge
variety of different species; they are characterized by broad
size range and dynamic organization of genomes, which are
the result of an initial genome duplication followed by subsequent independent evolution of the different lineages [51,52].
Comparison of divergent teleost genomes largely separated in
the phylogenetic tree, such as the medaka and zebrafish
genomes (approximately 115 to 200 million years [28]), is
thus a powerful tool with which to study gene regulatory
mechanisms. Adopting this strategy, we identified a cluster of
potential regulatory modules in the Six3 locus, which were
barely identifiable in a comparison among mammalian
genomes (compare Figure 2a with Figure 7a). VISTA analysis
of the available genomic sequences flanking the homologous
vertebrate Six3 genes revealed several blocks of highly conserved noncoding sequences in the gene surroundings.
Although a few of these blocks were located downstream of
the coding sequence (data not shown), we demonstrated that
the pattern of olSix3.2 expression could be recapitulated by
4.5 kb of genomic sequence flanking the 5' end of the gene.
This conclusion is based on a relatively efficient (roughly 20%
of injected embryos) and highly reproducible (basically 100%,
albeit with different EGFP intensity, thus excluding chromosomal position effects) transgenic analysis using three independent and stable medaka lines generated for all of the
constructs we tested. Thus, we are fairly confident that we
identified the main regulatory region for olSix3.2, although
we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that additional or
duplicated regulatory elements positioned in untested
regions may contribute to a refinement of the main expression domain. Indeed, redundant cis-regulatory elements have
been reported to control specific expression domains in different genes, including Otx2, Shh, and Sox2 [22,23,25].

reports

Six3 is an important regulator of vertebrate forebrain development. Gene regulatory network models predict that the
precise spatio-temporal expression pattern of genes fundamental for embryo development must be orchestrated by the
interaction of various regulatory regions [17]. Supporting the
model, we functionally demonstrated that the entire expression of the newly identified olSix3.2 is orchestrated by the
combined use of seven different cis-regulatory modules (Figure 6) and that at least part of this regulation is conserved in
the Six3 locus of vertebrates other than fishes. Two main
'enhancer' modules (D and I) are responsible for olSix3.2
expression at early and late stages of brain development,
respectively. Their activity is spatially refined by the function
of two 'silencers' and two 'silencer blockers'. In addition,
olSix3.2 expression in the lens ectoderm and in the differentiating retina requires the combined activity of five different
cis-regulatory modules. This apparently simple regulation
may hide additional organization, as we have demonstrated
for the I enhancer, in which an organized sequence of cis-regulatory elements control the posterior to anterior expression
of olSix3.2 in the brain.

ing developmentally important genes, with positive identification only of a fraction of them [21,39]. Because each
element is tested in an unconstrained context, negative regulators as well as modulatory functions of surrounding endogenous elements are also undetected using these approaches
[39]. In contrast, possibly benefiting from the high transgenesis efficiency of the medaka fish [50] and its compact
genome, we were able to assign enhancer, silencer, and modulatory functions to the majority of the highly conserved noncoding elements surrounding the Six3 gene in fishes. Testing
different combinations of these elements, we have also established their required interactions for proper expression of the
gene. Thus, to our knowledge, we provide the first description
of the regulatory code necessary for the expression of a vertebrate gene and offer a unique framework to define the entire
interplay of trans-acting factors that control the evolutionary
conserved use of Six3 during forebrain development.

comment

according to what expected given the sole presence of modules G to L, we could not exclude that this human region
contained regulatory information not readable in fish. Thus,
to rule out possible cross-species interferences, we amplified
from genomic DNA the equivalent Xenopus region, in which
the G to L elements are organized as in humans (Figure 7a).
Transgenesis analysis in Xenopus embryos using a construct
containing this fragment (X-cI; Figure 7c) yielded results
equivalent to those observed with the human fragment; EGFP
reporter expression was detected only at later stages of brain
development in the expected domain of Xsix3.2 expression
(Figure 7j,k). This supports the idea that the regulatory information for early Six3 expression in vertebrates other than
fishes reside in as yet unidentified genomic regions.

The regulatory region we have studied belongs to a newly
identified medaka Six3 gene, namely olSix3.2. Genomic
organization and phylogenetic analysis suggests that olSix3.2
is more closely related to the mammalian Six3 than the previously identified olSix3.1 [12]. Like its mammalian homolog
[4], olSix3.2 is strongly expressed in various forebrain regions
where its paralog is not expressed. Our comparative expression study suggests that the combination of expression
domains of olSix3.1, olSix3.2, and the related olSix6 correspond to the combined tissue distribution observed for the
mouse and chick Six3 and Six6 [32-34], with a preponderant
expression of olSix3.1 in the eye, of olSix3.2 in the telencephalic and thalamic regions, and of olSix6 in the hypothalamus. Genetic abrogation studies in mice demonstrated that
Six3 is necessary for the formation of forebrain, which is
absent in homozygous embryos [5]. Genetic deletion of Six6
instead is associated with pituitary defects, absence or hypoplasia of the optic nerves, and chiasm and alteration in neural
retina proliferation [58]. How the functions of olSix3.1,
olSix3.2, and olSix6 relate to those described in the mouse for
Six3 and Six6 is still unresolved and knock-down analysis of
all three genes in medaka will be necessary to address this
issue. Thus far, morpholino-based knock-down of olSix3.1
results in forebrain and eye defects, including loss of optic
stalk markers [9], whereas preliminary analysis indicates that
olSix3.2 morphants are characterized by strong ventral forebrain defects with minor eye malformations (De la Torre A,
Conte I, Bovolenta P, unpublished observations), suggesting
that the two olSix3 paralogs may cover Six3 as well as part of
the mouse Six6 functions, a possibility that is also supported

deposited research

In silico comparison identified ten conserved modules in the
teleost Six3 locus. Transgenic analysis in medaka demonstrated clear regulatory activity for seven of them, whereas
modules B, C, and L did not influence EGFP reporter expression. Although these modules might have subtle regulatory
activities below the resolution of our analysis, their conservation could reflect other important roles in gene transcription
control, such as regulation of chromatin structure or - in the
particular case of module L - they may contribute to minimal
promoter functions.

reports

Alternatively, the short-range regulation of olSix3.2 may be
linked to the chromosomal localization of the Six genes,
which are organized in two evolutionarily conserved clusters
[56]. Although the expression of the other Six family members (Six1, Six2, Six4, and Six5) is mostly associated with tissues of mesodermal and ectodermal origin [3], it is possible
that genes within the same cluster (Six4, Six1, and Six6) will

share a few regulatory elements, which might have imposed
constrains against rearrangement during evolution [57].

reviews

region of 10, 100, and even 1,000 kb away from their promoters have been reported [23-27,53,54], even in the compact
Fugu genome [46]. Genes with complex patterns of expression are predicted to have more regulatory elements and
occupy significantly more space in the genome than those
with simpler expressions that are restricted to populations of
cells with similarities or shared identity [55]. It is thus possible that the compactness of the olSix3.2 regulatory region
might reflect the association that exists among the main territories in which the gene is expressed. Indeed, the specification of telencephalic and eye fields appears to be closely
linked [2], and the initial expression of olSix3.2 in both
regions appears to depend on the activity of a single enhancer
element (D) and a distal silencer (A), which constrains the
expression domain to the anteriormost neural tube. This
hypothesis could also explain why the combined activities of
five different modules (D to H) are instead needed to control
expression in the lens placode, which is the only non-neural
domain of olSix3.2 expression. Nevertheless, compactness
does not appear to be, at least in this case, a reflection of simplicity, because each of the conserved modules may include
additional regulatory organization. This is the case of module
I, which is the main enhancer involved in the late embryonic
expression of the gene. Stepwise and internal deletions of this
module have revealed a peculiar organization, in a 5' to 3'
direction, of a series of cis-regulatory elements that are
required for the posterior to anterior spatio-temporal expression of olSix3.2 in the thalamus, hypothalamus, and telencephalon. The activity of the I module is refined by a silencer,
G, the activity of which is modulated by two silencer blockers
that act in a temporal sequence, thus establishing an
elaborate control code. Furthermore, although the L module
per se has no activity, we cannot totally exclude the possibility
that this module might contribute, together with modules E
to H, to the regulation of I, because it was present in the constructs used for this analysis.

by the phylogenetic position of olSix3.1, which falls almost in
between the Six3 and Six6 branches of the Six gene family
(Additional data file 2).
Comparative analysis of the regulatory code of the three
medaka genes currently ongoing in our laboratory might be
useful in complementing these studies by providing insights
into the sub-functionalization or neo-functionalization of
olSix3.1, olSix3.2, and olSix6 as compared with their mammalian counterparts. Furthermore, they will help to elucidate
whether Six3 and Six6 have arisen from the duplication of a
common ancestor, as previously proposed [56], possibly
duplicating at least part of their regulatory region. This is an
important point because, with the comparison parameters
used, we were unable to identify in other vertebrate species
the conservation and distribution of the A to F regulatory
modules characterized in fishes. This is particularly important for the A and D modules, which are the main regulators
of early Six3 expression in fishes. Informatics searches of corresponding regions in mammalian genomes yielded no clear
information, suggesting that these modules might be present
outside the regions that we analyzed or they might have
evolved differently in other vertebrate genomes, making their
search even more difficult than that of the H and I modules.
Alternatively, these modules may represent a new acquisition
of olSix3.2 caused by teleost genome duplication.
In our study, we demonstrated strong functional conservation between fishes and other vertebrates only for the G, H,
and I modules, which control late expression of olSix3.2. The
sequences that compose the H and I modules in fishes were
intermixed and differently arranged in other vertebrate
genomes, although their function was strongly conserved
when assayed in medaka and Xenopus transgenesis. This suggests that sequences from different vertebrates are activated
by common transcription factors, although the binding sites
for these factors might be distributed, oriented, or represented in different numbers among species. An additional
explanation for the different arrangement of the H and I
modules might be species-specific nucleotide modifications,
which have been proposed to contribute to gene transcriptional evolution [59-61].

Conclusion

Our study established the cis-regulatory code required for the
proper expression of olSix3.2 and demonstrates that there is
a need to test different combinations of highly conserved
putative cis-regulatory regions to elucidate how each conserved element contributes to the spatio-temporal control of
gene expression. In fact, one limitation of previous studies
that have used transgenic analysis to test the function of
highly conserved noncoding sequences is the identification of
single enhancers uprooted from possible interactions with
the remaining regulatory elements. Our comprehensive
description of the olSix3.2 regulatory code is now a powerful
starting point from which to define the entire interplay of
trans-acting factors that control the evolutionarily conserved
use of Six3 during forebrain development. From a broader
perspective, this type of information will be necessary to elucidate the composition and evolution of vertebrate gene regulatory networks, as compared with those of invertebrates such
as Drosophila and sea urchin, in which this type of information is accumulating at a much faster pace [17].

Materials and methods
Microinjection and establishment of transgenic lines
Adult and embryonic medaka fishes (Oryzia latipes) from the
Cab inbred strain were used throughout the study. Fertilized
eggs were collected immediately and incubated at 4 to 10°C in
Yamamoto's embryo rearing medium to suppress further
development [66]. DNA was prepared using a High Pure Plasmid Isolation Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). DNA injections
(10 ng/μl DNA in ISceI enzyme reaction) were performed as
previously described [50]. Embryos were staged according to
the method proposed by Iwamatsu [66], raised to sexual
maturity, and transgenic founder fishes were identified by
out-crossing to wild-type fishes. Transcriptional activation of
the constructs was monitored by EGFP expression observed
in living embryos under UV fluorescent stereo-microscopy
(Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Xenopus laevis
embryos were obtained and raised as described previously
[21]. Xenopus transgenesis was performed following the
same procedures as used for the medaka embryos.

Whole-mount in situ hybridization
Conservation of regulatory function between human and fish
in the absence of clear sequence conservation has previously
been reported also for the RET gene. In this case, lack of
correlation between the two events was even more marked,
and different in silico analysis designed to detect shorter
stretches of sequence similarities or the existence of inversion
and rearrangement failed to detect alignable sequences [62].
Thus, our data, together with few additional observations
[63-65], strongly support the idea proposed by Fisher and
colleagues [62] that some relevant regulatory information
might be conserved among species at a level that is not detectable using genomic sequence alignment.

Whole-mount in situ hybridizations were performed as previously described using digoxigenin labelled riboprobes [29].
Anti-sense and sense riboprobes for medaka olSix3.1,
olSix3.2, and olSix6 and the Xenopus Xsix3.2 were used. A
minimum of 40 embryos were hybridized for each marker
and condition. In toto hybridized embryos were photographed, embedded in gelatine/albumine block, and further
sectioned using a vibratome (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar,
Germany).

Sequence analysis
The vertebrate Six3 genomic sequences were retrieved from
public databases: Genome Browser UCSC [67] and JGI [68].

Plasmid constructions
A 4.5 kb region of olSix3.2 genomic sequence containing nine
nucleotides (corresponding to the first three amino acids) of
the coding region was cloned in frame with EGFP reporter
gene into the pSKII-ISceI-EGFP vector [50], to create the cI
construct. Xenopus and human sequences were amplified
from corresponding genomic DNA and cloned in the pSKIIISceI-EGFP vector with the same strategy. The medaka
deleted constructs pSix3.2ΔXhoI (cII), pSix3.2ΔXhoI-NsiI
(cVIII), and pSix3.2ΔXbaI-HindIII (cIX) were obtained by
digesting the pSix3.2-4.5 kb construct using the indicated
enzymes. All the other deleted constructs (pSix3.2Δel1,
pSix3.2Δel2,
pSix3.2Δel3,
pSix3.2Δel4,
pSix3.2Δel5,
pSix3.2Δel6, and pSix3.2Δel7; cXXIII to cXXIX) were
obtained by PCR amplification from pSix3.2-4.5 kb and then
cloned into pSKII-ISceI-EGFP vector. The A, B, and C modules were deleted by restriction enzyme digestion (A, NarI/
KpnI; B, BtsI/BglII; and C, BamHI/ClaI) and inserted (in
sense and anti-sense orientations) into the polylinker of
pSix3.2ΔXhoI (cIII to cV), pSix3.2Δel1 and pSKII-ISceI-TkEGFP (containing the tyrosine kinase minimal promoter)
vectors to test their potential regulatory activity. All of the
other modules were amplified and cloned (in sense and antisense orientations) into the polylinker of pSix3.2Δel1 (cVI to
cVII, cX, and cXII to cXVI) and pSKII-ISceI-Tk-EGFP (cXI
and cXVII to cXXII). The primer sequences used to generate
these constructs are shown in Supplementary Table I. All constructs were verified by automated sequencing.
