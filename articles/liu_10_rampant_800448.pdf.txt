Abstract
Background: Mitochondrial introgression may result in the mitochondrial genome of one species being replaced by
that of another species without leaving any trace of past hybridization in its nuclear genome. Such introgression can
confuse the species genealogy estimates and lead to absurd inferences of species history. We used a phylogenetic
approach to explore the potential mitochondrial genome introgression event(s) between two closely related green
pond frog species, Pelophylax nigromaculatus and P. plancyi.
Results: DNA sequence data of one mitochondrial and two nuclear genes from an extensive sampling of the two
species were collected, and the genealogies of the three genes were constructed and compared. While the two
nuclear genes congruently showed mutual reciprocal monophyly of both species, the mitochondrial phylogeny
separated a Korean P. nigromaculatus clade, a paraphyletic central China P. plancyi assemblage, and a large wellsupported introgression clade. Within the introgression clade, the mitochondrial haplotypes of the two species were
mixed together. This reticulated pattern can be most parsimoniously explained by an ancient mitochondrial
introgression event from P. plancyi to P. nigromaculatus that occurred at least 1.36 MYA, followed by multiple recent
introgression events from P. nigromaculatus back to P. plancyi within the last 0.63 MY. The re-constitution of previously
co-adapted genomes in P. plancyi may be responsible for the recent rampant introgression events. The Korean P.
nigromaculatus clade likely represents the only surviving "true" mitochondrial lineage of P. nigromaculatus, and the
central China P. plancyi assemblage likely represents the "original" P. plancyi mitochondrial lineage. Refugia in the
Korean Peninsula and central China may have played a significant role in preserving these ancient lineages.
Conclusions: The majority of individuals in the two species have either introgressed (P. nigromaculatus) or reclaimed (P.
plancyi) mitochondrial genomes while no trace of past hybridization in their nuclear genomes was detected.
Asymmetrical reproductive ability of hybrids and continuous backcrossing are likely responsible for the observed
mitochondrial introgression. This case is unique in that it includes an ancient "forward" introgression and many recent
"backward" introgressions, which re-constitutes the original nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of P. plancyi. This
hybrid system provides an excellent opportunity to study cyto-nuclear interaction and co-adaptation.
Background
Historical mitochondrial introgression often results in
the mitochondrial genome of one species being replaced
by that of another species without leaving any trace of
hybridization in its nuclear genome. The introgressed
genome can become fixed in some populations and

extend to a large portion of the recipient species' distribution. Wilson and Bernatchez termed this phenomenon
"ghost of hybrids past" [1]. For example, Melo-Ferreira et
al. found mitochondrial introgression from the mountain
hare (Lepus timidus) to three other hare species, L. granatensis, L. europaeus and L. castroviejoi in the Iberian
Peninsula [2,3]. Although L. timidus is currently not sympatric with the three Iberian hares, distribution range
expansion and retraction during glaciation might have
created opportunities for the species to hybridize. Selective advantage of the L. timidus mitochondrial genome

over others was attributed to the widespread presence of
the introgressed mitochondrial genome. McGuire et al.
also presented a case study in lizards of the genus Crotaphytus [4]. The mitochondrial genome of C. collaris has
replaced that of C. reticulatus in approximately twothirds of its range via an ongoing selective sweep. A unidirectional mitochondrial introgression also took place
from C. collaris to C. bicinctores. Introgressive hybridization may have occurred repeatedly but was temporally
separated throughout at least the latter half of the Pleistocene. Other cases of mitochondrial introgression have
been reported in diverse metazoan taxa including carabid
beetles [5], fruit flies [6], brook charr [7], megophryid
frogs [8], Sika deer [9], African elephants [10], and pocket
gophers [11].
Such processes have a number of significant implications in biology. (1) Mitochondrial gene introgression can
confuse the estimated genealogy of a species, because an
introgressed genome will not reveal any history before
the introgression events [12] and the mix of introgressed
and original genomes within a species could lead to
absurd inferences of the species history. Therefore, cautions should always be exercised when using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) alone to infer demography and
evolutionary history of a species. This is important
because in the last three decades, we have witnessed a
great number of "phylogeographic" studies using mtDNA
as a sole marker [13,14]. (2) Introgression often disrupts
the co-evolution between the mitochondrial and nuclear
genomes. Genes from both genomes encode several proteins that are critical to metabolism and an abrupt disassociation between the genomes may interfere not only
their respective normal function but also the established
genomic interactions and co-adaptation [15]. (3) Massive
introgression events were often suggested to be adaptive
processes driven by natural selection [1,4,12]. The spontaneous breakdown and reconstruction of mitochondrial-nuclear genome associations may open a unique
window to examine the adaptation process of a newly
introgressed mitochondrial genome, as well as to better
understand the interactive dynamics and co-adaptive
functioning between mitochondrial and nuclear
genomes.
Kim et al. first suggested a possible mitochondrial
genome introgression between two green pond frog species, Pelophylax nigromaculatus and P. plancyi chosenicus
[16]. Using mitochondrial cytochrome b partial
sequences, they found that the Japanese P. nigromaculatus is more closely related to Korean P. plancyi chosenicus
than to Korean P. nigromaculatus, while their nuclear
gene data (allozymes) unequivocally group the P. nigromaculatus populations together. Subsequently, they

hypothesized a possible mitochondrial genome introgression event between the two species. Nevertheless, the
extent, timing and directions of introgression were unresolved because of their small sample size (n = 7). Green
pond frogs in the genus Pelophylax (formerly part of the
genus Rana) are no stranger to inter-specific hybridization. Pelophylax esculentus, a species of hybrid origin
between P. lessonae and P. ridibunda, is probably the best
studied case of inter-specific hybridization [17]. Both P.
nigromaculatus and P. plancyi are common and widespread in eastern Asia, and their distribution ranges
largely overlap (Figure 1). Ecologically, P. nigromaculatus
is a generalist and occurs in a wide range of habitats
including small to large ponds and rivers. On the other
hand, P. plancyi requires more specific habitats and is
most commonly seen in large well-vegetated ponds, particularly those with lotus plants. Both species are spring
breeders and occasionally use the same breeding sites.
The gross morphology of the two species is similar but
they can be easily distinguished. While males of P. nigromaculatus have a pair of external vocal sacs, males of P.
plancyi have a pair of internal ones or do not have vocal
sacs at all. In addition, P. plancyi has a conspicuous dark
line along the back of its thigh that is lacking in P. nigromaculatus. Several other names have been proposed for
geographic populations of P. plancyi, including P. fukienensis, P. hubeiensis, and P. chosenicus. Some authors treat
them as valid species [18] while others treat them as subspecies of P. plancyi ([19]; see Frost [20] for references
and comments). In this study, we refer all populations
allocated to these names as the P. plancyi complex to
facilitate our presentation.
Following the lead of Kim et al.'s study [16], we use a
phylogenetic approach to explore the potential mitochondrial genome introgression between P. nigromaculatus and P. plancyi, and to detail its extension in both time
and space by extensive sampling of both species across
their ranges. Recent development in DNA sequencing
technology allows us to obtain large amounts of sequence
data from both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.
By comparing their gene genealogies, gene introgression
events can be revealed. If there was no historical mitochondrial introgression between P. nigromaculatus and P.
plancyi, both the nuclear and mitochondrial genes would
group haplotypes from each of the two species respectively in the same fashion, and Kim et al.'s hypothesis [16]
would be rejected. If introgressions occurred between the
two species, a phylogeny based on nuclear genes would
group haplotypes from each of the two species, but part
or all of the mitochondrial haplotypes from one species
would nest within the other species.

Results
Nuclear proopiomelanocortin gene (POMC) and tyrosinase
gene (TYR) genealogies

Sequence data were collected from two nuclear genes
(POMC and TYR). We first conducted a recombination
test for the nuclear gene data and did not detect any
recombination event at both global and pairwise levels.
Therefore, all data were proceeded for phylogenetic analyses without modification. Both Bayesian inference and
maximum parsimony methods were used to construct
the gene genealogy.
A total of 66 POMC sequences from 59 samples for
Pelophylax nigromaculatus (including one from GenBank) and 488 sequences from 321 samples for P. plancyi
complex were gathered. Two sequences for two outgroup
taxa, Lithobates catesbeianus and Staurois latopalmatus
were gathered from GenBank. A total of 611 nucleotide

sites were confidently resolved and 139 haplotypes were
identified, including two for the outgroup taxa. Among
the ingroup members, 83 sites were variable.
For the Bayesian analysis, the HKY+I+G model was
selected as the best-fit model by the hierarchical likelihood ratio test. Figure 2 shows one of the Bayesian trees
with posterior probabilities of the basal nodes mapped on
the tree. Both the resolution of the Bayesian consensus
tree and the posterior probabilities were low (Figure 2);
this was not surprising given the small number of variable
sites. However, three clades were clearly depicted on the
tree with moderate to high nodal supports. A P. plancyi
clade included all haplotypes from P. plancyi complex
except P. fukienensis, and a P. nigromaculatus clade
included all haplotypes of P. nigromaculatus except
CNU5268. CNU5268 (site 15) was a heterozygote and its
two haplotypes were grouped in the P. plancyi clade and

the P. nigromaculatus clade, respectively. Both clades
received high posterior probabilities (0.99 and 1.00). A
third clade, the P. fukienensis clade, included all samples
from P. fukienensis, with a low posterior probability
(0.63). For the maximum parsimony analysis, 41 sites
were phylogenetically informative. The parsimony analysis found more than 400,000 equally most parsimonious
trees (MPTs) with 130 steps, a consistency index (CI) of
0.4538 and a retention index (RI) of 0.8483. The strict
consensus tree (tree not shown) was similar but less
resolved compared to the Bayesian consensus tree. Again,
a P. nigromaculatus clade and a P. plancyi clade were
resolved with exactly the same membership as the Bayesian tree. The relationships within each clade were largely
unresolved. However, the haplotypes of P. fukienensis
samples did not form a monophyletic group. Rather, they
formed a paraphyletic assemblage at the base of the tree.
A total of 77 TYR sequences from 60 samples for Pelophylax nigromaculatus (including three from GenBank)
and 481 sequences from 321 samples for P. plancyi were
gathered. Three sequences for three outgroup taxa,
Babina pleuraden, Rana shuchinae, and Pelophylax
lessonae, were gathered from GenBank. A total of 601
nucleotide sites were confidently resolved and 79 haplotypes were identified, including three for the outgroup.
Among the ingroup members, 42 sites were variable and
23 were phylogenetically informative.
The parsimony analysis found better-resolved trees
than did the Bayesian analysis, and therefore, a simplified

Figure 3 The simplified phylogram of the strict consensus tree
from the parsimony analysis of the TYR gene data. The numbers
above the branches are Bayesian posterior probabilities from the
Bayesian analysis and the numbers below the branches are bootstrap
proportions. Bold lines and the "K" indicate haplotypes from the Korean nigromaculatus clade; all these haplotypes are shared between
members of the Korean nigromaculatus clade and others.

phylogram of the strict consensus tree from the parsimony analysis is presented in Figure 3. The analysis found
more than 400,000 MPTs with 93 steps (CI = 0.5161; RI =
0.8193). Both the resolution of the tree and the bootstrap
supports were low, which was not surprising given the
small number of informative characters. However, two
clades, a P. nigromaculatus clade and a P. plancyi clade
(including P. fukienensis) were clearly depicted on the
strict consensus tree with moderate nodal supports (Figure 3). For the Bayesian analysis, a SYM+I+G model was
selected as the best-fit model by the hierarchical likelihood ratio test. Similar to the parsimony tree, the Bayesian tree also had low resolution and nodal supports (tree
no shown). All haplotypes of the P. plancyi complex,
including P. p. fukienensis, were grouped together, in the
same way as in the parsimony tree, with a posterior probability of 0.96. However, the haplotypes of P. nigromaculatus did not form a clade, rather they formed a
paraphyletic assemblage at the base of the tree.
Both POMC and TYR genes produced two well-defined
clades: a P. nigromaculatus clade that includes all haplotypes of the P. nigromaculatus samples excluding
CNU5268 and a P. plancyi clade that included all haplotypes of the P. plancyi complex excluding haplotypes of P.
fukienensis. Both clades received moderate to high supports from both genes. The TYR gene tree had a lower
resolution than the POMC gene tree; although the Bayesian analysis of TYR gene failed to group all haplotypes of
P. nigromaculatus together (parsimony analysis did),
members of the two clades were always well separated on
every tree. A third group, the P. fukienensis clade that
included all samples of P. fukienensis, was weakly supported by the POMC gene data, and not supported (neither contradicted) by the TYR gene data. Examining the
sequence data directly, we found several fixed differences
between the three clades. There were 2, 2, and 1 sites of
the POMC gene and 2, 1, and 0 sites of the TYR gene that
are fixed for the P. nigromaculatus clade, the P. plancyi
clade and the P. fukienensis clade, respectively.
One individual (CNU5268) appeared to be an F1 hybrid
between P. plancyi and P. nigromaculatus. Two haplotypes from this individual were obtained by cloning and
were grouped with the P. plancyi clade and the P. nigromaculatus clade, respectively. Directly examining the
sequences, we found that CNU5268 was heterozygous at
all polymorphic sites between P. plancyi and P. nigromaculatus. For example, at position 90 of POMC gene, all P.
plancyi samples had a "C" while all P. nigromaculatus
samples had a "T". CNU5268 was heterozygous on the
site with "C" and "T". However, we cannot eliminate the
possibility that this individual resulted from a recent
backcross, e.g. F 2 or F 3, because we only examined two
gene loci.

Mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (Cyt-b) genealogy

Sequence data were collected from one mitochondrial
gene, Cyt-b. A total of 335 Cyt-b sequences were gathered
for the P. plancyi complex, including 333 new sequences
from this study and two sequences from GenBank. A
total of 330 Cyt-b sequences were gathered for P. nigromaculatus, including 57 new sequences from this study
and 273 sequences from several published sources. In
addition, four sequences for three outgroup taxa, P. saharicus, P. lessonae, and P. porosus were obtained from GenBank. Sequences from different studies had different
lengths; approximately half of the sequences included
1,043 nucleotide sites (full length) while others has 670850 sites at various positions. To accommodate the
majority, a data set of 1043 sites was created. A total of
380 haplotypes were identified, including three for the
outgroup taxa, and 393 sites were variable and 269 were
phylogenetically informative. A GTR+I+G model was
selected as the best-fit model by the hierarchical likelihood ratio test. A Bayesian tree of Cyt-b along with the
posterior probabilities is provided in Figure 4.
The Bayesian tree revealed several interesting features
(Figure 4). Similar to the POMC gene trees (Figure 2), it
resolved a P. fukienensis clade (clade A) at the very base of
the tree. The member composition of the clade was
exactly the same as the POMC tree. One outgroup taxon,
P. porosus, was placed between the P. fukienensis clade
and the other ingroup members. Unlike the nuclear gene
trees, haplotypes of P. nigromaculatus and P. plancyi did
not form two monophyletic groups, rather, they were
intermingled and together formed one monophyletic
group. Within this plancyi-nigromaculatus group, a
Korean P. nigromaculatus clade (clade B) branched off
first, which included all the P. nigromaculatus samples
from the Korean Peninsula and adjacent locations of
China (sites 2 and 3 and surrounding area; Figure 1). The
sistergroup of the Korean P. nigromaculatus clade
included a paraphyletic assemblage (group C) of haplotypes of P. plancyi from central China (sites 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 22, 23, 24 and 25 but predominantly
sites 6, 7, 9, 15, and 16; Figure 1) at the base and a wellsupported monophyletic group (clade D: the introgression clade) nested inside the paraphyletic group C. Clade
D was the most interesting group and included the
remaining P. nigromaculatus and P. plancyi haplotypes.
Within this clade, again, haplotypes from P. nigromaculatus and P. plancyi failed to form respective clades; haplotypes of P. plancyi sporadically nested within "bushes" of
P. nigromaculatus at 20 different places, except at the top
of the tree where a large number of haplotypes of P. plancyi formed a clade (D3). The basal branches of clade D
comprised haplotypes of P. nigromaculatus. Two haplotypes of P. nigromaculatus from western Sichuan and five
haplotypes from Japan formed two well-supported

Page 6 of 14

groups (D1 and D2) at the very basal position of clade D.
Although the overall nodal supports within clade D were
low, some close associations between haplotypes of P.
nigromaculatus and P. plancyi were well supported. Eight
clades, where haplotypes from both species were found,
received BPPs greater than 0.90 (Figure 4). Within each of
these eight clades, haplotypes of P. nigromaculatus and P.
plancyi were found to be identical or only different by one
or two base pairs. In addition, the overall clado-pattern of
the haplotypes within clade D bore little association with
their geographic locations, except a few well-supported
sister groups in which both members came from the
same area.
The parsimony analysis found more than 400,000
MPTs with 879 steps (CI = 0.3936, RI = 0.8733). Similar
to the Bayesian tree, the MP tree also defined a P. fukienensis clade, clade (B+C+D), clade B, clade (C+D), a paraphyletic group C, and several other nodes within clade D.
Several close associations between P. nigromaculatus and
P. plancyi within clade D were also identified. However,
the other relationships among the haplotypes were poorly
resolved compared to the Bayesian tree.
The estimated times of divergences between the major
mitochondrial lineages were mapped on the Cyt-b gene
tree (Figure 4). In general, these estimates were largely
congruent with several other independent studies. For
example, Lymberakis et al. estimated that the European
and Far Eastern lineages were separated 15 MYA [21],
and Sumida et al.'s estimate for this dichotomy was 5.910.9 MYA based on allozyme data [22]. These results
were relatively close to our estimate of 13.40 MYA (CI
8.33-18.92). Sumida et al. estimated that the split of P.
nigromaculatus and P. porosus took place at least 3 MYA
[23], and it was again congruent with our estimate of 2.93
to 6.25 MYA for this event.
There were major differences between the nuclear and
mitochondrial gene trees. Both nuclear genes resolved
both P. plancyi and P. nigromaculatus as monophyletic
clades, but the mitochondrial gene tree mixed haplotypes
from the two species together. On the other hand, a major
agreement among the nuclear (POMC) and mitochondrial gene trees was that all of them resolved a separated
P. fukienensis clade. All new sequences are deposited in
GenBank (accession numbers: Cyt-b GU977277POMC
GU977670-GU978222;
TYR
GU977669;
GU978223-GU978775). Aligned data sets that used to
generate the phylogenetic hypotheses are presented as
additional files 1, 2 and 3.

4), despite the clear separation between the two species
on both nuclear gene trees (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Other
evidence, such as morphological and ecological traits,
also strongly supports the validity of the two species [18].
The conflicting patterns between the nuclear and mitochondrial gene trees support Kim et al.'s hypothesis [16]
that there were historical mitochondrial introgressions
between P. nigromaculatus and P. plancyi. To best explain
our data, we further propose a multiple mitochondrial
genome introgression hypothesis: one ancient "forward"
mitochondrial introgression event from P. plancyi to P.
nigromaculatus followed by rampant recent "backward"
introgression events from P. nigromaculatus to P. plancyi.
Our nuclear gene data conform to several previous
studies and suggest that the P. plancyi and P. nigromaculatus are sistergroups [18,21]. The Korean P. nigromaculatus clade (clade B) on the Cyt-b gene tree likely
represents the only "true" mitochondrial lineage of P.
nigromaculatus, and its sistergroup (clade C+D) likely
represents the mitochondrial lineage of P. plancyi (Figure
4). The paraphyletic group C (the central China P. plancyi
assemblage) likely represents the "original" mitochondrial
lineages of P. plancyi, which have always been associated
with P. plancyi nuclear genomes. The introgression clade
D, which nests within group C, represents an introgressed P. plancyi mitochondrial lineage (Figure 4).
Within this clade, P. plancyi individuals are sporadically
dispersed throughout the "bushes" of P. nigromaculatus,
and the four basal sub-clades comprise P. nigromaculatus
individuals exclusively. The most parsimonious explanation for this pattern is that all individuals in this clade
share a common mitochondrial ancestor derived from an
ancient hybridization event between a female P. plancyi
and a male P. nigromaculatus. The introgressed P. plancyi
genome subsequently expanded to the majority of the
distribution range of P. nigromaculatus except the Korean
Peninsula and its adjacent areas. The nested P. plancyi
lineages represent P. plancyi individuals, which "took
back" their mitochondrial genomes from P. nigromaculatus via recent hybridization events. Of the 20 nested
placements of P. plancyi, there are cases where the closest
P. nigromaculatus relatives are not identified due to the
unresolved relationships on the tree. Nevertheless, there
are eight well-supported sub-clades (BPP >0.90) that
embrace both P. plancyi and P. nigromaculatus individuals. Each of these sub-clades likely represents a recent
mitochondrial introgression event from P. nigromaculatus to P. plancyi. The introgressions between the two species appear to be bi-directional and, at present, the
majority of both species possess introgressed, rather than
"original", mitochondrial genomes.
Overall, the multiple mitochondrial genome introgression hypothesis most parsimoniously accounts for our
data and also immediately provides an explanation for the

rampant introgression within the introgression clade
(clade D). In this clade, all P. nigromaculatus individuals
do, in fact, possess historical mitochondrial genomes of P.
plancyi, and the mitochondrial introgression from P.
nigromaculatus to P. plancyi actually results in re-union
of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes of P. plancyi.
The two genomes are already co-adapted, and therefore,
the introgression might have little negative impact on the
fitness of the hybrids.
A re-examination of the mitochondrial gene tree of the
two species, by increasing the number of taxa or number
of informative characters (nucleotide sites), may change
the topology and favor a different explanation. However,
our sampling of taxa (populations) is robust and more
taxa are unlikely to change the topology. More data could
improve the resolution of the tree, particularly within
clade D. Those will unlikely change the essentials of the
current hypothesis but will likely help to resolve the number of recent introgression events within clade D. The
intertwined pattern of the mitochondrial gene tree may
also be explained by incomplete lineage sorting [12],
however, it is probably not valid in our case. Due to the
maternal mode of inheritance, mitochondrial genes are
expected to reach coalescence up to four times faster than
nuclear genes [24]. In our study, both nuclear genes (particularly POMC) have reached coalescence at the species
level, and it is therefore unlikely that the more rapidly
evolving mitochondrial genes have not.
Diversification and introgression of the P. nigromaculatusplancyi mitochondrial genomes in time and space

The Korean nigromaculatus clade (clade B), which
includes all samples from the Korean Peninsula and adjacent locations of China, was separated from the rest at
approximately 2.93 MYA (Figure 4). Since the Korean
nigromaculatus clade represents the only "true" P. nigromaculatus mitochondrial lineage while all other P. nigromaculatus and P. plancyi possess a P. plancyi
mitochondrial genome, this split may coincide with the
speciation event that separated P. nigromaculatus and P.
plancyi. All other P. nigromaculatus possess an introgressed P. plancyi mitochondrial genome. This "true" P.
nigromaculatus mitochondrial lineage might have survived in the Korean Peninsula refugium during ice ages
and expanded to nearby areas of China during the interglaciation periods (sites 2 and 3, Figure 1). The Korean
Peninsula is a well-recognized refugium during several
glaciation cycles and has provided shelters for many
ancient lineages [25,26]. A recent phylogeographic study
of P. nigromaculatus by Zhang et al. also identified two
major clades, a Korean clade including samples from the
Korean Peninsula and adjacent China and a main clade
including the Japanese and most Chinese samples [27].
Without realizing that the main clade of P. nigromacula-

Liu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:201
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/201

tus was actually descended from P. plancyi, they hypothesized that the Gunz glaciation (0.9-1.2 MYA) might be the
cause of allopatric isolation and lineage splitting. Our
divergence time estimate (2.93 MYA) is older than that of
Zhang et al.'s [27], and the observed divergence is not a
lineage split within P. nigromaculatus, rather, it represents the separation between the two species.
The central China P. plancyi mitochondrial lineages
share a most recent common ancestor with clade D at
approximately 1.52 MYA (Figure 4). The central China
lineages may represent the only survivors of the "original"
P. plancyi mitochondrial genome. The majority members
of these lineages are from sites 6, 7, 9, 15 and 16 in the
vicinity of Da-Bie-Shan Mountains (site 9; Figure 1). The
persistence of these ancient lineages may be attributed to
the Da-Bie-Shan refugium. The Da-Bie-Shan and surrounding area is hypothesized to have been a glaciation
refugium since the Tertiary and maintains many ancient
endemic species [28,29]. These P. plancyi mitochondrial
lineages may have survived in the refugium and expanded
to the surrounding area (sites 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15,
16, 22, 23, 24, and 25; Figure 1).
Clade D represents an ancient mitochondrial genome
introgression event that occurred at least 1.36 MYA (CI
0.74-2.05). Most previous reported cases of mitochondrial introgression are recent and the introgressed mitochondrial genomes in the recipient species are identical
or nearly so to those in the donor species [2,6]. The two
reported exceptions are crotaphytid lizards and Scutiger
frogs. McGuire et al. reported repeated introgression
events between Crotaphytus collaris and C. bicinctores
and some could be as old as 2.5 MYA [4]. Chen et al.
reported a case between two species of Scutiger, which
was dated at approximately 3.5-9.5 MYA [8]. With
increasing haplotype divergence, it becomes more difficult to discriminate between introgression and incomplete lineage sorting [30], but our data provide a
convincing case of ancient mitochondrial genome introgression. We could not locate where this introgression
event might have occurred from our data; repeated glaciation circles and associated range expansions/contractions may have rendered it difficult, if not impossible.
Within the introgression clade (D), multiple introgression events have taken place over time and space. There
are at least eight well-supported sub-clades that demonstrate close associations between P. nigromaculatus and P.
plancyi and represent at least eight independent introgression events. If we consider those sub-clades that did
not receive high nodal supports, introgressions from P.
nigromaculatus to P. plancyi may have independently
taken place as many as 20 times. All these introgression
events are probably recent. The common ancestor of the
clade that includes most of clade D excluding D1 and D2,
is 0.63 MYA (CI 0.28-1.02); therefore, all divergence

Page 9 of 14

within this clade should be younger than this time estimate. Within these eight well-supported sub-clades, the
differences between P. nigromaculatus and P. plancyi are
small: some are identical while the largest differences are
two of the 670 base pairs that were compared. Furthermore, the introgression events may have occurred at various locations. Within the eight well-supported subclades, closely associated haplotypes of P. nigromaculatus
and P. plancyi are often from the same area. For example,
all individuals of both species in sub-clade 2 are from
Zhang Jia Jie (site 26), and in sub-clade 3, all individuals
are from Zhejiang Province of China (sites 11 and 13).
Interestingly, the Korean P. plancyi is not closely related
to the Korean P. nigromaculatus, suggesting that the
Korean P. plancyi may not be indigenous, and is probably
recently established. In addition, the hybridization
between the two species appears to be an ongoing process and this is evidenced by an F1 hybrid identified in
the present study.
Mechanisms of mitochondrial genome introgression and
replacement

Asymmetrical reproductive ability of hybrids and continuous backcrossing are likely responsible for the observed
mitochondrial introgression and replacement between
the two green pond frogs. Kawamura and Nishioka
reported that all male F 1 hybrids between P. nigromaculatus and P. plancyi chosenicus were sterile, but half of the
female F 1 hybrids were probably fertile [31]. Both field
observation and lab experiments also confirmed that
among crosses between P. nigromaculatus and P. porosus,
females were partially fertile but males were completely
sterile [32]. Haldane's rule predicts that when in F 1 offspring of two animal species, one sex is sterile, the sex is
usually the heterogametic sex. Pelophylax nigromaculatus has an XX/XY sex determination [33], and therefore,
the above observations are consistent with Haldane's rule.
While frequent inter-specific hybridization is the necessary first step toward mitochondrial genome introgression, such asymmetrical reproductive ability of hybrids
would greatly facilitate backcrossing and the disappearance of hybridization signals in the nuclear genome while
the introgressed mitochondrial genomes remain intact.
Other mechanisms, such as asymmetries in species abundance or mating preferences and male-biased colonization [2,34] may also play a role in promoting
mitochondrial introgression between the two green pond
frogs.
The introgressed mitochondrial genomes in both P.
nigromaculatus and P. plancyi expanded to the majority
of their distribution ranges. McGuire et al. proposed two
non-exclusive explanations for mitochondrial replacement across an extended geographic area: frequent
hybridization events followed by genetic drift, or selective

Liu et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:201
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/201

sweeps associated with rare hybridization [4]. The introgression from P. nigromaculatus back to P. plancyi is
clearly a case of multiple rampant introgression events,
and hence is consistent with McGuire et al's hypothesis
[4]. On the other hand, the introgression from P. plancyi
to P. nigromaculatus (the ancient introgression event)
appeared to have occurred only once, so selective sweep
might have been involved but we do not have data for this
hypothesis. Thermal adaptation has been proposed for
selection in several cases [7]. Nevertheless, no direct evaluation of the selective advantage of introgression event
has so far been conducted. Theoretically, when species
invade a new area, capturing an already adapted mitochondrial genome from the local species may provide the
invader with a selective advantage [12].
Taxonomic implications

Considering information from all three genes, Pelophylax
fukienensis is a valid species. The nuclear gene POMC
indicates that all its samples form a monophyletic group
and possess fixed differences at several nucleotide sites
from P. plancyi. At site 17, P. fukienensis, P. nigromaculatus and P. plancyi are sympatric. Of the 22 specimens that
we examined, no hybrid was found, suggesting established reproductive isolation between the three species.
Furthermore, the P. fukienensis clade is separated from all
other P. plancyi by another valid species, P. porosus, on
the mitochondrial gene tree. Pope first named the species, "Rana" fukienensis [35], but most recent authors
considered it as a synonym of P. plancyi [19]. Based on
molecular data, Sumida et al. recently suggested that it is
a valid species, and is likely more closely related to P.
porosus than to P. nigromaculatus [22]. Its distribution
may include the island of Taiwan and the adjacent coast
region of mainland China. However, many populations
from inland of China, which were previously diagnosed
as P. fukienensis (e.g. sites 10, 11, 12, 16 in [18]), are in fact
P. plancyi.
Our data do not support the validity of P. hubeiensis
and P. chosenicus. Both mitochondrial and nuclear genes
failed to reveal any distinctiveness of the populations
under the two names. The Korean populations of P. plancyi (=P. chosenicus) may have only invaded the Peninsula
recently. Their reported morphological differences [18]
are likely geographic intra-specific variations.

Conclusions
There are multiple mitochondrial introgression events
between the two green pond frog species, including one
ancient "forward" introgression event from P. plancyi to P.
nigromaculatus followed by rampant recent "backward"
introgression events from P. nigromaculatus to P. plancyi.

Page 10 of 14

The majority of individuals in the two species have either
introgressed (P. nigromaculatus) or reclaimed (P. plancyi)
mitochondrial genomes while no trace of past hybridization in their nuclear genomes was detected. The mitochondrial introgression between these two species is
unique in several ways. First, one introgression event is
ancient, estimated at 1.36 MYA. Most previous reported
cases of mitochondrial introgression are recent [2,6]. Second, independent introgression events from P. nigromaculatus to P. plancyi result in re-constitution of cytonuclear association of P. plancyi. This is the first such
case. Third, there are multiple (as many as 20) but spatially and temporally separated introgression events. Such
introgression is likely an ongoing process; the F 1 hybrid
that we found suggests that hybridization between the
two species may frequently occur.
Mitochondrial genome introgression and replacement
may be more common than we previously perceived. For
example, inter-specific hybridization among amphibians
is common, and mechanism that can produce mitochondrial introgression, such as asymmetrical reproductive
ability of hybrids, is also commonly observed ([36,37];
Additional examples in Duellman and Trueb [38]). The
common occurrence of such hybridization events likely
has produced numerous mitochondrial genome introgressions in nature populations waiting to be detected.
Using mitochondrial genes alone to infer species history or to determine species status can be misleading,
and mtDNA only represents an incomplete history of a
species [12]. This message has been repeatedly demonstrated by numerous studies. A large number of mtDNA
based phylogeographic studies and their conclusions may
need to be revisited.
This mitochondrial introgression between P. nigromaculatus and P. plancyi provides a unique opportunity to
study cyto-nuclear interaction and co-adaptation. Within
P. nigromaculatus and P. plancyi, there are nuclear
genomes interacting with their "original" and "coevolved" mitochondrial genomes, and those interacting
with "introgressed" foreign mitochondrial genomes. If the
two genomes in every species were co-adapted, a recent
mitochondrial introgression would most likely create
mismatches between the mitochondrial vs. nuclearencoded components (e.g. subunits for the electron
transport chains) and cause functional disruption [15].
Such matches or mismatches can be examined and compared for different populations. Recent development in
proteomics have provided us powerful tools to model the
protein structure [39] and investigate the potential
impact of these mismatches on the function of the protein molecules, which in turn may have significant
impacts on the fitness of the hybrid lineages.

Methods
Sampling

An extensive coverage, particularly of the mitochondrial
lineages of the two species, is essential for investigating
the extent of mitochondrial introgression. A total of 333
specimens of the Pelophylax plancyi complex from 23
collecting sites were examined in this study, which
included all four subspecies (plancyi, fukienensis,
hubeiensis, and chosenicus), and covered most of the species' distribution (Figure 1). In addition, mitochondrial
Cyt-b gene sequences of one sample from the Korean
Peninsula (AF205087) and one from the island of Taiwan
(AB029941) were obtained from GenBank.
A total of 60 specimens of P. nigromaculatus from 29
collecting sites were included in this study, which covered
the majority of the species' distribution and represented
the three main lineages defined by a previous study [27].
In addition, 273 mitochondrial Cyt-b gene sequences representing samples from 75 locations were also obtained
from GenBank (DQ006233-DQ006267, AY803813AY803895, AJ880539-AJ880677, AY355755-AY355757,
AF205087, AF274929, AF467981, AB029937, AB036396,
AB043889, NC002805) and other published sources.
Most of the sequences were from four previous studies of
the species [16,23,27,40]. We did not sequence many new
individuals of P. nigromaculatus because a large number
of sequences were already available. Four nuclear gene
sequences (POMC AB360151; TYR D12514, AY322363.
DQ360045) were also obtained from GenBank.
Eight ranid species, Pelophylax lessonae, P. saharicus, P.
perezi, P. porosus, Babina pleuraden, Rana shuchinae,
Staurois latopalmatus, Lithobates catesbeianus, were
selected as outgroup taxa. Most of these species were
considered closely related to P. plancyi and P. nigromaculatus [18,20,21,41]. All their sequences were obtained
from GenBank (POMC AY819106, AB360150; TYR
DQ360042, DQ360057, AY322347; Cyt-b DQ474177,
EU047779, AB029938, AB036402). Different dataset used
different outgroup combinations depending on the availability of data. Detailed information of specimens and
collecting sites are listed in Additional file 1 and shown in
Figure 1.
Laboratory protocols

We sequenced one fragment from the mitochondrial
genome and two fragments from the nuclear genome.
The mitochondrial Cyt-b gene is one of most frequently
used genes in vertebrates for phylogenetic construction,
and several previous studies of P. nigromaculatus used
this gene fragment [27,40]. By using the same fragment,
we were able to incorporate the published data in our
analysis. From the nuclear genome, we selected the
POMC and TYR as markers because they have been
extensively used for ranid species and both demonstrate

Page 11 of 14

variability at population level. All primers used in this
study are listed in Table 1.
Genomic DNA was isolated from liver or muscle tissues using a standard phenol/chloroform extraction protocol [42]. Standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
amplification was performed with an annealing temperature that was optimized for each primer pair (Table 1). All
PCR products were verified on 1% agarose gels and purified using QIAquick PCR purification kits (Qiagen). The
purified products were directly cycle-sequenced with the
same primers from both directions. All DNA sequencing
reactions were performed using BigDye terminator
sequencing chemistry with an ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems) automatic sequencer.
Nuclear fragments that contained overlapping peaks
(double nucleotide calls), were cloned using a pGEM-T
Easy Vector System I (Promega) to verify the sequence of
each haplotype in heterozygous individuals. Restriction
enzyme reaction (EcoRI blue/white cloning qualified
EcoRI restriction enzyme, Promega) was first performed
using plasmid extraction in white clones to determine the
colonies that contain positive inserts. Bacterial-PCR was
then performed using selected positive individual clones
as templates. The PCR products were purified and
sequenced following the same protocols specified above.
Data analysis

All sequences were checked and edited using BioEdit
(version 7) [43]. All alignments were completed using
MacClade (version 4) [44]. All three fragments were from
coding regions and therefore the alignment was straightforward. Prior to phylogenetic analysis of the haplotypes,
recombination tests were conducted for all nuclear gene
sequences. If recombination occurs within a fragment,
phylogenetic methods that produce cladograms (bifurcating trees) would be inappropriate.
We used Sawyer's [45] method to test for recombination. Following the author's recommendation, the default
parameters of the computer program Geneconv (Version
1.81) [46] were used, which include the highest acceptable P value of 0.05, Bonferroni correction for multiple
comparisons, scanning sequence pairs, and a permutation of 10,000. The mismatch penalties parameter was
varied from small (gscale = 1) to infinite (gscale = 0) to
allow sequence mismatch within each potentially conversed gene fragment.
A phylogenetic analysis was conducted to establish the
genealogy of the DNA haplotypes. Both maximum parsimony method and Bayesian inference were used. The
parsimony analysis was conducted with PAUP* (version
4.0b10) [47]. All characters were equally weighted and
unordered. All phylogenetically uninformative characters
were excluded from analysis. Heuristic searches with
1000 random sequence addition replicates were used

with tree bisection reconnection (TBR) branch swapping.
Due to the large number of similar haplotypes, a
100,000,000 rearrangement limit was imposed on each
replicate to reduce the computation time. Nodal support
was estimated with bootstrap analyses [48] using 100 replicates. Within each bootstrap replicate, 10 random
sequence addition replicates were conducted with a
100,000,000 rearrangement limit on each replicate.
The Bayesian analysis was conducted with MrBayes
(version 3.2) [49]. A best-fit DNA substitution model was
first selected by MrModeltest (version 2.1) [50]. A flat
"prior" setting was used in MrBayes and four Markov
chains were executed. Each dataset was run for
10,000,000 generations and trees were sampled every 500
generations. We used the last 10,000 sampled trees to
estimate the consensus tree and the Bayesian posterior
probabilities, and all other trees were designated as
"burn-in". Tracer (version 1.4) [51] was used to plot the
resulting likelihood values and to determine when the
Markov chains reached convergence. Two separate runs,
which included a total of four independent tree searches,
were conducted and the resulting trees were compared
and pooled.
For divergence time estimates, a Bayesian method with
computer program BEAST (version 1.5.1) [52] was used.
We were only interested in the divergence times of the
major clades, therefore, a simplified data set was constructed for the BEAST analysis. Most similar haplotypes
of P. fukienensis, P. nigromaculatus and P. plancyi were
excluded, and only eleven haplotypes were included,
which represented the major lineages. Nine additional
taxa, Glandirana rugosa (AF205093), Pelophylax bedriagae (DQ474141), P. cretensis (DQ474147), P. epeirotica
(DQ474153), P. kurtmuelleri (DQ474156), P. lessonae
(EU047779), P. perezi (DQ902146), P. porosus (AB029938,
AB036402), and P. saharicus (DQ474177) were introduced to provide a calibration point and a root for the
tree. We used the separation of the island of Crete from

50°C

Bossuyt and Milinkovitch [57]

the mainland as a calibration point, which corresponds to
the separation of P. cretensis from the common ancestor
of P. bedriagae, P. epeirotica and P. kurtmuelleri [21].
Geological studies dated the separation at 5-5.5 MYA
[53,54]. A HKY+I+G was used to describe the substitution model, a Yule process was used to describe speciation and an uncorrelated lognormal (UCLN) model was
used to describe the relaxed clock [55]. BEAST was run
for 80,000,000 generations with samples taken every
1,000. Three independent MCMC runs were conducted.
