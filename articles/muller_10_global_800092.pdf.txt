Abstract
Background: Myxococcus xanthus is a Gram negative bacterium that can differentiate into metabolically quiescent,
environmentally resistant spores. Little is known about the mechanisms involved in differentiation in part because
sporulation is normally initiated at the culmination of a complex starvation-induced developmental program and only
inside multicellular fruiting bodies. To obtain a broad overview of the sporulation process and to identify novel genes
necessary for differentiation, we instead performed global transcriptome analysis of an artificial chemically-induced
sporulation process in which addition of glycerol to vegetatively growing liquid cultures of M. xanthus leads to rapid
and synchronized differentiation of nearly all cells into myxospore-like entities.
Results: Our analyses identified 1 486 genes whose expression was significantly regulated at least two-fold within four
hours of chemical-induced differentiation. Most of the previously identified sporulation marker genes were
significantly upregulated. In contrast, most genes that are required to build starvation-induced multicellular fruiting
bodies, but which are not required for sporulation per se, were not significantly regulated in our analysis. Analysis of
functional gene categories significantly over-represented in the regulated genes, suggested large rearrangements in
core metabolic pathways, and in genes involved in protein synthesis and fate. We used the microarray data to identify a
novel operon of eight genes that, when mutated, rendered cells unable to produce viable chemical- or starvationinduced spores. Importantly, these mutants displayed no defects in building fruiting bodies, suggesting these genes
are necessary for the core sporulation process. Furthermore, during the starvation-induced developmental program,
these genes were expressed in fruiting bodies but not in peripheral rods, a subpopulation of developing cells which do
not sporulate.
Conclusions: These results suggest that microarray analysis of chemical-induced spore formation is an excellent
system to specifically identify genes necessary for the core sporulation process of a Gram negative model organism for
differentiation.
Background
Many bacteria have evolved the ability to survive longterm environmentally unfavourable conditions by differentiation into dormant resting stages, most commonly
referred to as spores or cysts. Production of resting stages
involves major rearrangements of many fundamental
growth and cell-cycle processes and thus represents an
important tool for understanding core physiological
mechanisms themselves. Resting stage differentiation in

prokaryotes is phylogenetically diverse and, not surprisingly, there is a large variety in the mechanisms employed
[1].
The mechanism of sporulation has been most intensively investigated in Gram positive species such as Bacillus subtilis which forms endospores in response to
unfavourable environmental conditions. These spores
arise from an asymmetric cell division event which produces a prespore that becomes engulfed by, matured
within, and then released from, the mother cell [2]. The
complex, multi-layered spore surface which is important
for much of the endospore's extraordinary resistance

properties is assembled onto the pre-spore surface within
the protective compartment of the mother cell [3].
Most of the Myxobacteria, a group of Gram negative
soil inhabiting delta proteobacteria, are known to produce spores in response to starvation. The spores of
Myxococcus xanthus, the best characterized of the
myxobacterial species, are produced by remodelling the
rod-shaped cell into a sphere in the absence of a cell division event. The resulting spores are resistant to up to
60°C heat, desiccation, UV-irradiation, sonication, detergents and enzymatic digestion [4]. Thus, the M. xanthus
sporulation mechanism is significantly different from
that of endospore formation and serves as an important
model for alternate prokaryotic differentiation processes.
Because M. xanthus is a predatory bacterium whose
growth is facilitated by high population density, the cells
have evolved to sporulate in mounds to aid in dispersal of
groups of cells [5,6]. Differentiation into spores is thus
coupled to an approximately 72 hour starvation-induced
multicellular developmental program [7] in which cells
are first directed to aggregate into mounds of approximately 105 cells, and spore differentiation is induced at
the completion of aggregation and only within these
mature mounds (fruiting bodies). The developmental
program also includes cells that follow different cell fates
including lysis (~80% of the initial population), and formation of peripheral rods which remain outside of the
fruiting bodies and do not sporulate [8-10]. Thus, sporulation occurs in a minor proportion of the starving cells
and is indirectly dependent upon multiple factors necessary to produce fruiting bodies, such as a threshold population density, motility, and a complex cascade of interand intra-cellular signals (reviewed in [11]). It is, therefore, difficult to identify processes that are specific for
only the core sporulation mechanism. These factors
impede analysis of the core sporulation process via global
gene or protein expression analyses.
It is also possible, however, to artificially induce sporelike entities in exponentially growing nutrient-rich broth
cultures by addition of certain chemical compounds, such
as 0.5 M glycerol [12], 0.7 M dimethyl sulfoxide [13,14],
beta-lactam antibiotics, and D-amino-acids [15]. In particular, addition of 0.5 M glycerol induces differentiation
of virtually all of the cells in the culture into spores within
8 hours [12]. Glycerol-induced spores are not identical to
starvation induced spores; mainly, they have a considerably thinner spore protective layer [16,17], and they lack
certain proteins that have been previously identified in
starvation induced spores (ie. the surface spore coat proteins S and C) [18,19], and the internal poly-phosphate
storage Protein W [20]). Furthermore, in contrast to starvation induced spores in which the genome is duplicated,
glycerol-induced spores have a variable genome copies
likely due to the replication state of the vegetative cells at

Page 2 of 20

the time of glycerol addition [21]. Importantly, however,
glycerol-induced spores share several key features with
starvation-induced spores including morphogenesis into
spherical entities that are phase bright under light
microscopy, resistance to heat and ultrasound treatment,
and the ability to germinate into rod-shaped vegetative
cells [4]. Thus, although artificial induction of sporulation seems to have fallen out of favour as a tool [22], it
clearly remains a good model system for investigation of
the core mechanisms related to differentiation of vegetative rods into resistant, quiescent entities. In particular,
because the glycerol-induced sporulation process is synchronized and bypasses the complex signalling pathways
required for fruiting body formation, it is an excellent system in which to employ global gene profiling analyses to
identify genes essential for the core differentiation process.
In this study, we performed global transcription analysis on a time course of a chemically (glycerol)-induced
sporulation process with three goals: 1) to determine
whether microarray analysis of the chemically-induced
sporulation process can be employed as a useful tool to
understand the starvation-induced sporulation process,
2) to obtain an overview of the cellular processes that are
regulated during sporulation, and 3) to identify specific
genes necessary for the core sporulation process. We
report that 22% of the genes represented on the microarray chip were significantly regulated relative to vegetative
cells. Most of the known sporulation marker genes were
significantly upregulated in our data set. Analysis of the
functional categories of the regulated genes suggested
large proportions of the genes involved in energy metabolism, protein synthesis and fate, and in two-component
signal transduction are regulated. Using the microarray
data, we identified a locus of eight genes that are necessary for production of viable spores under both glyceroland starvation-induced development, which we termed
nfsA-G. Our data suggest these genes are transcribed
together in an operon, and a PnfsA::mCherry fusion demonstrated nfs is expressed within fruiting bodies during
starvation induced-development, but not in peripheral
rods. Consistently, nfs expression is altered in mutants of
several key developmental regulators necessary for
appropriate expression of sporulation genes.

Results and Discussion
Microarray analysis of glycerol-induced spore formation in
Myxococcus xanthus

To identify genes that function specifically during M.
xanthus sporulation, we performed microarray analysis
on a time course of the glycerol induced sporulation process using microarray chips generated by The Institute
for Genomic Research [(TIGR), now the J. Craig Venter
Institute (JCVI)] in which of 6 687 of the 7 380 M. xan-

thus protein coding genes assigned by JCVI (90.6%) are
represented in triplicate analyzable spots of 70-mer single
stranded DNA oligomers. Microarray analysis was performed using Cy™3/5-labelled cDNA generated from cells
harvested 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours after addition of glycerol
and was referenced to cDNA prepared from vegetatively
growing cells just prior to addition of glycerol. Genes
called significantly regulated were selected by a delta
value from SAM analysis where the false discovery rate
was 5% in combination with a two-fold cut-off criteria in
at least one time point.
Analysis of the resulting microarray data revealed a
total of 1 486 significantly regulated genes, corresponding
to 22% of the analyzable orfs included on the chip. Of
these regulated genes, 843 (13%) were upregulated and
643 (10%) downregulated. To validate the microarray
data, the expression patterns of certain up- (sigB, sigC,
mspC, prU), down- (Mxan_5543, atpE) and un-regulated
(devR) genes were confirmed by real-time PCR (Additional file 1). The 843 significantly upregulated genes
were next grouped into self organizing maps in which
genes were clustered based on similar transcriptional
expression patterns. Our analysis revealed two patterns
of expression: genes whose expression peaked either at
0.5 - 1 hour (class I; 366 genes) or at 2-4 hours (class II;
477 genes) after induction with glycerol. These results are
summarized in heat maps (Figure 1A) and in Additional
file 2.
Regulation patterns of known sporulation markers

To determine whether microarray analysis of the glycerol-induced sporulation process could be a useful tool to
understand the core sporulation process, we first examined whether genes encoding proteins or activities previously described to be involved in glycerol-induced
sporulation displayed the predicted regulation patterns in
our microarray data. Genes were designated as markers if
when mutated they failed to produce glycerol-induced
spores, if the respective proteins were shown to be upregulated, or if the respective enzyme activities had been
demonstrated as increased during glycerol induced sporulation (Table 1). Five previously described genes yield a
significant glycerol-induced sporulation defect when
mutated: four different genes coding for proteins that, as
members of the enhancer binding protein family, are
involved in transcriptional regulation (nla4, nla6, nla18,
and nla24) [23], and one gene (exo) encoding for a
homolog of a polysaccharide export protein [24]. Of these
genes, only nla6 is significantly upregulated in our data
(Table 1). exo (Mxan_3227) was considered an unreliable
spot on the microarray chip, but subsequent real-time
PCR analysis confirmed that the gene was indeed upregulated (data not shown), as has been previously demonstrated using a lacZ fusion reporter [24]. The remaining

three markers which were not significantly regulated
(nla4, nla18, nla24) also displayed mutant vegetative
growth or motility phenotypes [25-27], suggesting these
genes could be constitutively expressed.
It has also been previously reported that the spore coat
proteins Protein S1 (ops) [28] and Protein U (pru) [29]
can be detected in glycerol induced spores, while Protein
S2 (tps), and a putative phosphate storage protein, Protein W (prw) [20] are not (Table 1). Consistently, ops and
pru, but not prw, were significantly upregulated. In contrast to previous data, however, we observed that tps was
also upregulated 3.7-fold, suggesting ProteinS2 may be
post-transcriptionally regulated. Protein C has been identified in the spore coat of starvation induced spores, and
is absent from glycerol-induced spores; however, the corresponding gene has not yet been identified (Table 1).
Finally, of the enzyme activities that have been specifically shown to be upregulated during glycerol induced
sporulation, aceA and aceB, likely encoding isocitrate
lyase (EC 4.1.3.1) and malate synthase (EC 2.3.3.9; previously EC 4.1.3.2), were highly upregulated (Table 1). Consistent with accumulation of trehalose in glycerol induced
spores [30], genes involved in trehalose synthesis, (treY,
treS, and otsAB) were all detected in the significantly
upregulated genes (Table 1). Finally, a four-fold increase
in NADP-coupled isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.41)
activity was reported increased during glycerol-induced
sporulation [31], which is in contrast to the observed
down regulation of the corresponding gene (icd;
Mxan_3537). This inconsistency may be caused by posttranslational regulation of isocitrate dehydrogenase activity, likely via phosphorylation/dephosphorylation [32].
Thus, all of the examined glycerol-induced sporulation
markers either displayed the predicted regulation patterns (8/13) or deviated from the prediction with plausible explanations (5/13), suggesting that our global
transcriptional profiling analysis yielded data that correlate with empirically derived data. Importantly, these correlations suggest that transcriptional regulation patterns
can be used to predict functional importance during glycerol sporulation. An important caveat, however, is that in
addition to genes whose protein products are subject to
post-translational regulation, genes that function under
both vegetative and sporulation phases of the life cycle
(for instance, transcriptional regulators), may be overlooked.
Regulation patterns of starvation-induced sporulation
markers

An ultimate goal of this study was to generate a tool to
understand the core M. xanthus sporulation process.
Therefore, we next determined whether our global transcriptional profiling of glycerol-induced sporulation
could also be correlated to the starvation-induced sporu-

lation program. Genes previously demonstrated to be
"core" starvation-induced sporulation genes were examined to see if they were significantly upregulated in our
data. In the starvation-induced developmental program,
induction of sporulation is normally coupled to completion of aggregation. Therefore, mutants in many genes
that are not specifically involved in the sporulation mechanism (i.e. mutants that affect starvation- or population
density-sensing, motility, or coordination of fruiting body
formation) nevertheless produce a sporulation defect
[33]. We specifically avoided non-core sporulation genes
by choosing genes that, when mutated, significantly
reduce the production of viable spores but do not appreciably prevent the formation of fruiting bodies (summarized in Table 2); genes described in Table 1 were not
included here. Proteins MspA, MspB, and MspC were
previously identified via comparative proteome analysis
of spores and vegetative cells [34]. In our microarray data,
mspA and mspC were upregulated, while mspB was not
significantly regulated (Table 2). Genes cbgA and fdgA
encoding a homolog of a Bacillus sp. sporulation protein,
and a polysaccharide export protein, respectively, are
both necessary to form fully resistant spores [35,36] and
are both upregulated in the microarray data. Genes actA
and actB, both predicted to encode response regulators of
the two-component signal transduction family whose
function thus far is proposed to be regulation of the level
of CsgA (a key regulator of the aggregation and sporulation in the starvation-induced developmental program)

[37], were upregulated in our microarray data. Interestingly, both mutants fail to produce glycerol-induced
spores (data not shown). mrpA, encoding a histidine
kinase proposed to function as a phosphatase to regulate
sporulation through its cognate response regulator [38],
is also significantly upregulated. The dev genes, which are
exclusively expressed within fruiting bodies and are
required for sporulation [39,40], and aglU which when
mutated displays vegetative motility defects but is not
necessary to build aggregation centres [41], were both not
significantly regulated in our analyses. Therefore, the
majority (9/12) of this list of core sporulation genes were
significantly upregulated. These observations suggest
that upregulation of genes during glycerol-induced sporulation can be used to predict function during starvation-induced sporulation.
Out of interest, we also examined the expression profiles of 67 genes known to be involved in regulation of the
developmental program (and which were analyzable on
the chip) but which are not sporulation specific (i.e. are
not listed in Tables 1 or 2), and 60 of these genes were not
significantly upregulated under our analysis conditions
(Additional file 2). Among the exceptions were mrpC and
fruA, encoding two key developmental transcriptional
regulators which function early during the starvationinduced developmental program [38,42,43]. Mutants in
either mrpC or fruA fail to aggregate or sporulate. It has
been determined that MrpC induces fruA expression
[44], acts as an antitoxin to control programmed cell

death [10], and together with FruA regulates genes
expressed late in the developmental program [45,46].
Interestingly, we observed that ΔmrpC mutants are
unable to form glycerol induced spores (data not shown),
hinting that MrpC may also be necessary to induce core
sporulation genes. Taken together, these data suggest that
genes upregulated during glycerol induced sporulation
represent good candidates for the core sporulation mechanism and hint that genes involved only in regulation of
the developmental program are largely not significantly
upregulated.
Glycerol-induced sporulation involves major
rearrangements in transcription of metabolic and
housekeeping genes

To gain insight into the processes that could be upregulated during glycerol-induced sporulation, we examined
which categories of genes were significantly regulated. As
a general overview, we started with the main role categories assigned during annotation by JCVI which were further amended so that unassigned genes (largely
hypothetical genes) were assigned to a category, and
genes with multiple designations were assigned to one
category based on BLAST analysis (R. Hedderich, unpublished) (Additional file 2). A detailed analysis of the regulation patterns of gene categories is limited by the current
annotation, and some ambiguity and inconsistencies in
gene main role assignments, but these analyses nevertheless highlight certain core processes in which large
changes in regulation are observed. These analyses suggested that 40% (125/311) of the genes assigned to the
main role category "energy metabolism" were significantly regulated with a probability that this proportion
was obtained from chance of 2.5 × 10-14 (p = 2.5 × 10-14)
(Figure 1B and Additional file 2). Equal proportions (20%)
of these regulated genes were significantly over-represented in the up- and down-regulated genes (p = 9.9 × 105 and p = 1.9 × 10-10, respectively). Additionally, 37% (15/
41;p = 0.03) of the genes assigned to the "central intermediary metabolism" category were significantly regulated
with equal proportions down- and up-regulated.
Further examination of "energy metabolism" subrole
categories revealed that 35% (7/20; p = 1.1 × 10-3) and
30% (6/20; p = 3.0 × 10-2) of the genes assigned to the
TCA cycle subcategory were down- and up-regulated,
respectively. In addition, 39% (6/18; p = 1.8 × 10-2) of the
genes assigned to the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways were upregulated. Interestingly, 41% (13/39; p = 1.4
× 10-4) of the genes assigned to the "biosynthesis and degradation of polysaccharides" subrole category were
upregulated. To integrate these observations, we examined which genes were significantly up- or down-regulated in the context of M. xanthus metabolic pathways.
For these analyses, we started with the pathways assigned

Page 7 of 20

by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) Pathways database [47-49] and amended the
pathways based on previous literature and data from our
analyses (Figure 2). These observations strongly suggest
that during glycerol-induced sporulation, M. xanthus
cells downregulate large portions of the TCA cycle,
upregulate the glyoxylate shunt, and upregulate gluconeogenesis. Most of the upregulated genes in this pathway fall into the class I category of upregulated genes
(yellow bars, Figure 2) suggesting these metabolic
arrangements occur early in the glycerol-induced sporulation program. These data are consistent with previous
studies of specific enzyme activities [50,51]. The net
effect of these metabolic actions would likely be production of precursors to carbohydrate synthesis which is
important for two reasons: 1) M. xanthus cells do not
grow on carbohydrates [31] and obtain both carbon and
energy from amino acids and fatty acids [52,53], and 2)
carbohydrate production increases by 200% during glycerol-induced sporulation in both soluble and insoluble
fractions [51] likely corresponding to protective or storage compounds (e.g. trehalose [30] and glycogen [54])
and spore coat polysaccharides [16], respectively).
Consistent with net production of phosphoglucose
units, it has been previously demonstrated that the glycerol-induced spore coat consists of 75% carbohydrate
containing two-thirds N-acetyl-galactosamine and onethird glucose [16,55] and that enzyme activities involved
in converting fructose biphosphate to UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine are upregulated during sporulation [56].
The gene likely to encode the final epimerization reaction
(Mxan_3507) was also significantly upregulated in our
data (Figure 2). It is not known how the spore coat is
added to the surface of the cell, but good candidates
include a highly upregulated cluster of nine genes
(Mxan_3225-3233) some of which share homology to
polysaccharide export genes. Interestingly, fdgA and exo
(aka Ω7536) are in this locus; fdgA mutants aggregate but
do not sporulate [36], and exo has previously been characterized as a gene necessary for both glycerol and starvation-induced sporulation [24].
We also observed that three different pathways leading
to trehalose synthesis were upregulated represented by
otsAB (Mxan_1192), treY [Mxan_1533; treZ (Mxan_0541)
was not analyzable on the chip], and treS (Mxan_3684). It
has previously been demonstrated that OtsAB can convert glucose 6-P directly into trehalose [57], while TreY
and TreZ convert glycogen into trehalose [58,59]. Consistent with accumulation of glycogen, a gene encoding a
glucose-1 phosphate adenyltransferase (Mxan_1524)
which is necessary to convert Glucose-1-P to ADP-glucose, a precursor to glycogen, is also upregulated. Finally,

Figure 2 Representation of M. xanthuscore energy metabolism pathways significantly influenced at the transcriptional level during glycerol-induced sporulation. M. xanthus metabolic pathways identified by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathway database
[47-49] were amended as described in the text and were examined for significantly regulated genes. Genes are designated as the four digit Mxan_
number. Significantly downregulated, upregulated class I, upregulated class II, and not significantly regulated genes are identified by blue, yellow,
orange, and white outlined boxes, respectively. Entry sites of amino acids or fatty acids into the metabolic pathways are indicated in red. Consumption

more, trehalose into maltose [60,61] suggesting TreS may
also be necessary during spore germination.
In addition to large rearrangements of metabolic processes, analysis of over-represented functional groups in
the significantly regulated genes revealed that the categories "protein synthesis- ribosomal proteins: synthesis and
modification" [(25/52, p = 5 × 10-21)] and "protein fateprotein and peptide secretion and trafficking" (17/53, p =
3 × 10-8) were both over-represented in the downregulated genes (Additional file 2). In contrast, the category
"protein fate-degradation of proteins, peptides, and glycopeptides" category was significantly over represented
(27/136; p = 0.01) in the upregulated genes. Several categories representing cellular processes necessary only in
vegetative growth were significantly overrepresented in
the downregulated genes including "motility and chemotaxis" (13/62, p = 0.02), "siderophores" (5/5, p = 8 × 10-6),
and "biosynthesis of natural products" (13/51, p = 0.0008)
(Additional file 2). Together, these transcriptional patterns are consistent with down-shift of new protein synthesis and turn over of proteins required in vegetative
growth in preparation for spore differentiation and quiescence.
We also examined the proportions of significantly regulated genes involved in regulatory processes (i.e. gene regulation and signal transduction). It has been suggested
that in contrast to sporulation program in B. subtilus
which is regulated primarily by cascades of sigma factor
expression, the M. xanthus starvation-induced developmental program is regulated by cascades of signal responsive non-sigma transcriptional regulators [62]. In our
analyses of glycerol induced sporulation, the "transcription-transcription factors" category was not significantly
represented (11/60, p = 0.5) amongst the regulated genes,
although the sigma 54 transcription factor (rpoN;
Mxan_1061), sigB (Mxan_3357), sigC (Mxan_6209), as
well as two extracytoplasmic function (ECF) transcription factors (Mxan_2500 and Mxan_4733) were significantly upregulated (Additional file 2). rpoN fell into the
class I early upregulated genes, and correlates with the
observation that several enhancer binding proteins
(EBPs) are required for glycerol induced sporulation [23];
EBPs help RpoN form a transcription-competent open
promoter complex [63]. sigB (and the remaining upregulated transcription factors) fell into the class II later
upregulated genes, consistent with a role in spore maturation rather than spore formation [64]. Signal responsive
"one component" transcriptional regulators [65], mainly
lying in the "regulatory functions-DNA interactions" category, were significantly under-represented in the regulated genes (14/160; p = 4 × 10-5) (Additional file 2).
However, we cannot rule out that these genes are constitutively expressed or are not highly regulated at the transcriptional level. Examination of the representation of

Page 9 of 20

genes involved in signal transduction demonstrated that
the "signal transduction-two-component signal transduction (TCST)" category was over-represented in the upregulated genes (44/255, p = 0.03) and dispersed in both
class I (19/44) and class II (25/44) upregulated genes. It is
tempting to speculate that TCST systems, which contain
protein members that can act as EBPs or other transcriptional regulators, play a dominant role in regulation of the
core sporulation program. The relatively large family of
eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinase genes (predominant in the "regulatory functions-protein interactions"
category), were not significantly represented (23/106, p =
0.9) in the regulated genes (Additional file 2).
The most interesting aspect of spore formation in M.
xanthus is the reorganization of the rod-shaped cell to
form a spherical spore. Control of shape transition is not
understood, and none of the genes encoding proteins
putatively necessary for the rod shape (eg. mreB and
rodA) are significantly regulated in our analysis, although
we have observed that inhibition of the function of the
cell cytoskeleton protein MreB prevents glycerol induced
spore formation (E. Cserti, F. Müller, and P. Higgs, unpublished observations). Intriguingly, it was recently demonstrated that peptidoglycan is degraded during glycerolinduced sporulation [66]. Examination of the microarray
data indicated that genes encoding peptidoglycan synthesis enzymes [such as PBP1A (Mxan_5911), PBP1C
(Mxan_2419), DacB (PBP4; Mxan_1070) were significantly upregulated (Additional file 2), and we speculate
that the cells likely first rearrange peptidoglycan during
shape transition from rod to sphere and that peptidoglycan may be subsequently degraded after the spore coat is
in place; these hypotheses are currently being investigated in our group.
Identification of the nfs cluster necessary for efficient
production of viable spores

A third goal of our studies was to identify novel genes
which are specifically necessary for the core sporulation
process. To this end, we searched the significantly upregulated genes for candidates using the following criteria:
Genes should be 1) highly upregulated (≥ 16-fold), 2)
encode proteins that are predicted to localize to the cell
envelope, and 3) encode proteins whose function has not
been characterized (i.e. hypothetical proteins). These criteria were based on the rationalization that genes highly
expressed are usually important structural components
and that sporulation involves major rearrangements of
the cell surface in a process that is largely uncharacterized
in Gram negative spore formers. Approximately 20 genes
fit our criteria, including several genes that lay in a single
locus of eight consecutive genes (Mxan_3371 to
Mxan_3378) which were encoded in the same orientation
(Figure 3). Specifically, the microarray data suggested all

eight genes shared the same transcriptional pattern and
were at least 10-fold upregulated within 0.5 hours of glycerol induction (Table 3). The transcriptional pattern of
three of these genes (Mxans 3371, 3374, and 3378) were
confirmed by real-time PCR analysis (Table 3). All eight
genes were annotated as hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins (Table 3). Finally, at least six of the eight
genes were predicted to encode proteins that reside in the
cell envelope (Table 3).
To determine if these genes were indeed necessary for
glycerol induced sporulation, we generated a complete
in-frame deletion of Mxans_3371-3378 in the DK1622
wild type background, generating strain PH1200. To
assay for viable spore production in response to glycerolinduction, we induced both PH1200 and DK1622 cultures with glycerol for 24 hours, subjected them to heat

and sonic disruption, and examined the remaining cells
by phase contrast light microscopy. While the wild type
culture produced phase bright spherical spores, no spores
or cells could be detected in the mutant (data not shown).
Consistently, when equivalent proportions of the treated
cultures were incubated for 7 days on rich media plates,
the mutant formed only 0.001% of the wild type colonies
arising from the germinating spores. We could show that
this mutant phenotype arose from the deletion of the
nfsA-H genes and was not due to a secondary effect
because of the following reasons: 1) two additional independently generated mutants bearing the same in-frame
deletion displayed identical phenotypes (data not shown),
2) polar effects would not be observed since the adjacent
downstream gene is orientated in the opposite direction
(Figure 3) and is not expressed during glycerol induced

sporulation as assayed by real-time PCR (data not
shown), and 3) in-frame deletions of each single gene in
the locus generated the same mutant phenotype (manuscript in preparation). Thus, one or more of the genes in
the locus are necessary for glycerol-induced sporulation.
To determine whether the deletion mutant is also perturbed in starvation induced sporulation, the mutant was
induced to develop on nutrient-limited CF agar plates.
The mutant began to aggregate exactly as wild type and
formed similar looking aggregates from 0-24 hours (Figure 4A). However, by 48 hours, the wild type fruiting
bodies began to darken with the onset of sporulation,
whereas the mutant fruiting bodies failed to darken even
after continued incubation for 120 hours (Figure 4 and
data not shown). After 120 hours, harvested cells were
subject to heat and sonic disruption, and enumerated
using a hemacytometer. While the wild type produced 2.2
± 0.3 × 107 heat and sonication resistant entities, the
mutant produced 6.3 ± 1 × 106 entities (28 ± 16% of wild
type) which, when examined by phase contrast light
microscopy, were non-refractile, slightly misshapen
spheres compared to the spherical refractile wild type
spores (Figure 4B). Germination ability was assayed by
plating both wild type and mutant on nutrient rich agar,
the mutant produced 5 ± 34% of wild type germinating
spores.

Figure 4 The nfs locus is necessary for formation of viable starvation-induced spores. A. Starvation induced developmental phenotype of the wild type (DK1622) and Δ(nfsA-H) (PH1200) strains. 4 × 107
cells were spotted onto nutrient limited CF agar plates, incubated at
32°C, and development was recorded at the indicated times. By 24
hours development cells aggregate into mounds (fruiting bodies) of
approximately 105 cells. Fruiting bodies are displayed at higher magnification at 72 hours to illustrate that the Δ(nfsA-H) fruiting bodies fail to
darken. B. Heat and sonication resistant spores (wild type; DK1622) and
entities [Δ(nfsA-H); PH1200] isolated after 120 hours of development

When assayed for development under strict starvation
submerged culture conditions, the mutant behaved similarly as on nutrient limited CF plates: mutants cells aggregated with the same timing as wild type, but the fruiting
bodies failed to darken (data not shown). Interestingly,
under submerged culture conditions, the mutant formed
103 ± 12% of wild type heat and sonication resistant
spores (2.9 ± 0.7 × 106 and 2.8 ± 0.4 × 106 spores, respectively). However, the non-refractile misshapen mutant
entities only germinated at 3 ± 16% of wild type levels
(wt: 3.5 ± 0.6 × 106; Δnfs: 9.3 ± 2 × 104 germinating
spores) (data not shown). Together, these results indicate
that one or more of the eight genes in this newly identified locus are specifically necessary for the core sporulation process. We therefore propose that the eight genes in
this locus should be designated nfs (necessary for sporulation) A-H.
nfsA-H consist of a single transcriptional unit

The observations that the eight nfs genes are oriented in
the same direction and our finding that they share the
same glycerol-induced expression pattern suggested that
these genes could comprise a single transcriptional unit.
Careful examination of the gene sequences in this locus
strongly suggested that currently annotated start codons
for nfsD and nfsF were likely incorrect. In nfsD, the GTG
start codon is not preceded by a sequence that could fit to
a Shine-Dalgarno ribosome binding site, whereas an ATG
codon 48 bp downstream [base pair (bp) 3918630 of the
published genome sequence] is preceded by an appropriately positioned GCCAGGAGC sequence. In nfsF, the
start codon is predicted to be TTG, unlikely in the GC
rich M. xanthus, whereas the third codon downstream is
an ATG (bp 3923942).
Based on differential gene transcription patterns
between the upstream Mxan_3370 gene and nfsA, a promoter likely exists upstream of nfsA. However, significant
intergenic regions could be identified between nfsB and C
(23 bp), nfsC and D (214 bp), nfsE and F (207 bp), nfsF and
G (55 bp), and nfsG and H (152 bp). As per the current
annotation, we could not identify convincing open reading frames in these intergenic regions. To determine if
these genes are co-transcribed, we attempted to PCR
amplify these intergenic regions using cDNA generated
from 30 min glycerol-induced cells. PCR products could
be detected from all of these intergenic regions except
between nfsC and nfsD (Figure 5A). Control reactions in
which wild type genomic DNA was used as a template
produced the expected PCR product in all reactions; no
PCR products could be detected using ΔnfsA-G genomic
DNA or when mock cDNA samples in which either the
reverse transcriptase or template RNA was omitted was
used as template. These results suggest two putative pro-

Müller et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:264
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/264

moters in the nfs locus: upstream of nfsA and upstream of
nfsD.
To further examine whether these two putative promoters could drive gene expression, we generated
PnfsA::mCherry and PnfsD::mCherry fusions in which the
323 bp upstream of the first codon of nfsA (PnfsA) and 964
bp upstream of nfsD (PnfsD), respectively, were fused to
the second codon of the gene encoding the red fluorescent protein, mCherry. These constructs were inserted
into the heterologous Mx8 phage attachment (attB) site
in the wildtype DK1622 genome, resulting in strains
PH1220 and PH1227, respectively. As positive and negative controls, we also constructed strains bearing the

Page 12 of 20

essentially constitutively active pilA promoter (PpilA)
fused to mCherry (PpilA::mCherry) (PH1221) and the vector backbone (without the mCherry gene) (PH1222),
respectively. All strains exhibited the wild type glycerolinduced sporulation and starvation-induced development, indicating the respective plasmid insertions did not
generate a mutant phenotype (data not shown). These
strains were examined by fluorescence microscopy for
mCherry production in vegetative growth conditions and
at several time points after induction with glycerol. In the
PpilA::mCherry strain, fluorescence was detected in vegetative rods and throughout the differentiation process,
while in the vector control strain only low level of background autofluorescence was detected (Figure 5B).
Examination of the PnfsA::mCherry strain revealed that
fluorescence was not detected in vegetative rods, but
began to be detected between 0.5 to 1 hours after induction with glycerol (Figure 5B). In contrast, no significant
expression could be detected at any of the examined time
points in the PnfsD::mCherry strain (data not shown).
Similar results were observed when the cells were
induced to develop in response to starvation: specific fluorescence could be detected in the sporulating
PnfsA::mCherry strain (described below), while only nonspecific fluorescence could be detected in the
PnfsD::mCherry strain (data not shown). These results suggest that a second promoter does not lie in the intergenic
region between nfsB and nfsD and that the reverse transcriptase-PCR did not amplify this region perhaps
because of interfering secondary structure in the RNA or
cDNA. Thus, the nfsABCDEFG genes are most likely a
single transcriptional unit expressed from a promoter
lying within the 323 bp upstream from nfsA.
nfs is expressed late during starvation-induced
development specifically in sporulating cells

Figure 5 A promoter element upstream of nfsA likely drives expression of nfsA-H. A. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis on the intergenic regions (indicated by lines in Figure 3) between nfsB and nsfC (BC), nfsC and nfsD (C-D), nfsE and nfsF, (E-F), and nfsG and nfsH (G-H). PCR
products were amplified from genomic DNA (gDNA) from wild type
strain DK1622 (wt) or Δ(nfsA-H) strain PH1200 (nfs), and from cDNA
generated in the absence (-RT) or presence (+RT) of reverse transcriptase, or from a mock cDNA reaction in which RNA was omitted
(water). RNA from cells induced with glycerol for 0.5 hours was used to
generate cDNA. B. Expression of mCherry reporter constructs during
glycerol induced sporulation. Strains expressing mCherry fused after
the promoter from pilA (PpilA::mCherry; strain PH1221), the 500 bp upstream of nfsA (PnfsA::mCherry; strain PH1220) or the vector backbone
(vector; strain PH1222) were induced with glycerol, harvested at the indicated time points, and examined by fluorescence (left images) or DIC
(right images) microscopy.

To examine the expression pattern of the nfs mutants
during starvation induced development, we next measured the relative mCherry fluorescence of the
PnfsA::mCherry, PpilA::mCherry and vector control strains
by developing the cells in submerged culture in dishes
that could be inserted directly into a plate reader and thus
measured fluorescence at various times during the developmental program. The PpilA::mCherry fusion was
detected from 0 hours and gradually increased 2.5-fold at
36 hours of development (Figure 6A). In contrast, the
PnfsA::mCherry fusion began to be detected between 1218 hours of development increasing to 6.5 times at 36
hours. There was a gradual accumulation of autofluorescence in the vector control strain (Figure 6A) which may
correspond to build up of exopolysaccharides.
Two cell types have been observed during the starvation-induced development program in M. xanthus, cells

Müller et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:264
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/264

that aggregate into fruiting bodies and then differentiate
into spores, and cells that do not aggregate and remain as
undifferentiated peripheral rods. To examine whether
both cell types expressed the nfs locus, the
PnfsA::mCherry, PpilA::mCherry and vector control strains
were developed for 36 hours, fruiting bodies were separated from peripheral rods by low speed centrifugation,
and the cells from both fractions were examined by fluorescence microscopy. Both peripheral rods and spores
fluoresced in the PpilA::mCherry strain, while in the
PnfsA::mCherry strain, mCherry specific fluorescence
could only be detected in spores (Figure 6B). Together,
these results demonstrate that during the starvation
induced developmental program, nfs is expressed late in

Figure 6 nfs genes are upregulated late during starvation induced development and expressed only within sporulating cells.
A. The starvation-induced developmental program was induced in
submerged culture for strains expressing mCherry fused after the promoter from pilA (PpilA::mCherry; strain PH1221), the 500 bp upstream of
nfsA (PnfsA::mCherry; strain PH1220) or the vector backbone (vector;
strain PH1222) in the DK1622 background. At the indicated times,
mCherry fluorescence was recorded in a plate reader. B. Constructs expressing mCherry fused after the promoter from pilA (PpilA::mCherry;
strain PH1221), the 500 bp upstream of nfsA (PnfsA::mCherry; strain
PH1220) or the vector backbone (vector; strain PH1222) in the DK1622
background were induced to develop under submerged culture for 36
hours. Peripheral rods and fruiting body spores were separated and examined by fluorescence (left images) or DIC (right images) microscopy.

the developmental program and specifically within the
sporulating cells.
During the starvation induced developmental program,
the expression of many sporulation specific genes is
dependent, directly or indirectly, on several key developmental regulators which are necessary for inducing fruiting body formation and coordinating onset of sporulation
with completion of aggregation [11]. To determine if the
nfs locus fits this class of sporulation specific genes, we
next analyzed the PnfsA::mCherry expression pattern during starvation-induced development in strains bearing
disruptions in key developmental regulators (fruA, csgA,
devR, and exo (Mxan_3227). Both fruA and csgA mutants
fail to form fruiting bodies and cannot sporulate [42,67].
PnfsA::mCherry was not expressed in the csgA mutant, but
surprisingly, was induced earlier in the fruA mutant compared to the wild type background (Figure 7A). FruA is a
transcriptional regulator, and these results suggest that
FruA might, directly or indirectly, initially repress nfs
expression. dev mutants aggregate but fail to sporulate
and the dev genes are expressed exclusively in fruiting
bodies [39,40]. In the dev mutant background,
PnfsA::mCherry expression was similar to that in the wild
type background from 0-18 hours, but subsequently
failed to accumulate to wild type levels (Figure 7B).
Finally, like dev mutants, exo mutants aggregate but cannot sporulate, and exo is not expressed in dev mutants
[24]. In the exo background, PnfsA::mCherry was
expressed at slightly higher levels than in wild type but
followed a similar induction pattern (Figure 7B). These
results are consistent with the class of genes that are
expressed exclusively in fruiting bodies and dependent on
the coordination of sporulation to aggregation.
In summary, our experimental data indicates that the
nfs locus is necessary for the core sporulation process
based on the following observations: 1) the Δ(nfsA-H)
mutant is compromised in the ability to produce both
glycerol- and starvation-induced viable spores, but does
not affect formation of starvation-induced fruiting bodies, and has no obvious vegetative defect, 2) the locus is
upregulated during both sporulation pathways, and is
expressed specifically in the sporulating cell subpopulation during starvation-induced development, and 3) nfs
expression during starvation-induced development
shares a similar pattern of dependency on key starvationinduced developmental regulators as for other previously
described sporulation markers [24].
These genes encode proteins that contain no previously
characterized catalytic domains, and it is thus unclear
what exact role the proteins play in spore formation.
Although NfsE (Mxan_3225) has been annotated as
"putative adventurous motility protein T", presumably
because it shares some sequence similarity with a gene

membrane via a lipid attachment, and NfsD is predicted
to encode an amino-terminal transmembrane segment
suggesting it is anchored in the inner membrane. Furthermore, secondary structure analysis of NfsA and NfsH
predicts these proteins are beta-barrels consistent with
localization in the outer membrane. BLASTp analysis
indicates that NfsA-H contain orthologs in the Myxobacteria species Stigmatella aurantiaca (Stiau_2471 to
_2480) and the synteny of the locus is conserved. All
together, these observations, coupled with our experimental data, suggest the Nfs proteins are located in the
cell envelope and likely form a functional complex which
is necessary to produce viable spores. We are currently
confirming the localization and further analyzing the
function of the individual proteins during both glyceroland starvation-induced sporulation.

suggest that NfsD and NfsE contain multiple tetra-tricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains which play a role in mediating protein-protein interactions [69], and NfsG
contains a forkhead-associated (FHA) domain which also
mediates protein interactions to phospho-threonine containing proteins [70]. NfsA, B, C, and H contain putative
signal sequences consistent with export from the cytoplasm, NfsE is predicted to be anchored in the outer

Conclusions
Global transcriptional analysis of artificially-induced
spore differentiation in Myxococcus xanthus, a Gram negative bacterium, was shown to be an excellent model system for the core sporulation program which normally
occurs at the culmination of a starvation-induced multicellular developmental program. Examination of significantly regulated gene transcriptional patterns provided
an overview of sporulation associated rearrangements of
metabolic and physiologic processes. From the significantly upregulated gene pool, a locus of hypothetical
genes was identified and demonstrated to be essential for
the core sporulation process in both the artificial- and
starvation-induced developmental program.
Methods
Strains and growth conditions

Strains used in this study are listed in Additional file 3. M.
xanthus strains were grown vegetatively at 32°C on CTT
agar plates (1% Casitone, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM
potassium phosphate pH 7.6, 8 mM MgSO4, 1.5% agar) or
in CTT broth (CTT lacking agar) [71]. Plates were supplemented with 100 μg ml-1 kanamycin or 10 μg ml-1
oxytetracycline, where necessary. Escherichia coli cells
were grown under standard laboratory conditions in
Luria-Bertani broth supplemented with 50 μg ml-1 kanamycin, where necessary.
Microarray sample preparation, probe generation and
hybridization

To analyze global gene expression patterns during the M.
xanthus glycerol-induced sporulation process, microarray analysis was performed on three independent biological replicates in which samples from 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours
after glycerol-induction were compared to reference vegetative samples. To generate samples, M. xanthus
DK1622 cells were grown in CTT broth at 32°C with

Müller et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:264
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/264

shaking at 240 rpm on horizontal shakers. At an optical
density at 550 nm (OD550) of 0.5, half of the culture (for
reference) was removed and immediately added in 45 ml
aliquots to 5 ml stop solution (5% ethanol saturated phenol pH > 7), harvested by centrifugation at 4°C, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C. The remaining
culture was treated with 0.5 M glycerol (final concentration) with continued incubation as above. At 0.5, 1, 2 and
4 hours after addition of glycerol, samples were harvested
as above.
Total RNA from cells harvested at each time point was
isolated using the hot phenol method as previously
described [72,73]. RNA was then treated with DNase I
(Ambion) and purified via RNeasy column (Qiagen)
according to manufacture's instructions. RNA was confirmed to be free of contaminating DNA by PCR analysis.
Microarray probes were generated as previously
described in detail [73]. Briefly, RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer primers
(pd(N)6, Amersham) in the presence of a deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix (25 mM each dATP, dCTP, dGTP,
10 mM dTTP, 15 mM aminoallyl-dUTP), and Stratascript
reverse transcriptase (Stratagene). RNA was subsequently hydrolyzed, samples were purified, vacuum concentrated, and recovered in 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate,
pH 9.3. NHS-ester dyes Cy™3 or Cy™5 (Amersham) were
coupled to amino groups of the aminoallyl-dUTP incorporated cDNA. After purification, labelling efficiency was
determined photometricaly and the labeled probes were
either used directly for hybridization or stored at -20°C.
Microarray hybridization experiments were performed
as previously described in detail [73]. Briefly, M. xanthus
oligo arrays (JCVI) were first pre-hybridized in 5 × SSC
buffer (0.75 M NaCl, 75 mM sodium citrate pH 7.0), 0.1%
SDS and 1% (w/v) BSA fraction V at 42°C for 2 hours,
washed in water, submerged in isopropanol and dried by
low speed centrifugation. Cy™3- and Cy™5-labeled probes
(representing reference and sample of one particular time
point) were diluted in hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5 × SSC buffer, 0.1% SDS, 0.6 μg ml-1 salmon sperm
DNA), combined in equal volumes and heated at 95°C for
three minutes. Probes were applied to the prehybridized
arrays, covered with a LifterSlip™ (Erie scientific),
mounted into a hybridization chamber and incubated
submerged in a water bath for 16 h at 42°C. Arrays were
washed three times in the following buffers: Buffer 1: 2 ×
SSC pH 7.0, 0.1% SDS; Buffer 2: 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS; Buffer 3: 0.1 × SSC. Arrays were scanned with a
GenePix™4000B microarray scanner using GenePix™ Pro
6.0 image analysis software (Axon instruments) at 532
nm (Cy3™) and 632 nm (Cy5™) wavelengths simultaneously.

Microarray data analysis

Image analysis (block and spot finding, background
detection) and data acquisition were performed with
GenePix™ Pro 6.0 image analysis software. Each slide was
checked manually for correct positioning of the grid and
detection of each spot. Normalization and data analysis
were carried out with Acuity 4.0 software package (Axon
instruments) applying the following criteria: Normalization: Ratio based (mean ratio of medians = 1); Substance
name ≠ EMPTY; Substance name ≠ NULL; F532 Median
- B532 ≥ 100 OR F635 Median - B635 ≥ 100 in at least one
time point.
The biological replicates were analyzed with the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) software version
2.23 (Stanford University) to screen for significantly regulated genes. The pre-filtered datasets were first analyzed
using signed area regulation analysis. A median false discovery rate (FDR) of 5% (corresponding to a delta value of
0.89) was allowed to call a gene significantly regulated.
The three sets of regulated genes were then combined in
Acuity generating mean values for each gene at each time
point. Genes that displayed a mean log ratio < -1 or > +1
(corresponding to 2-fold up- or down-regulation) in at
least one time point with data present for all time points
were considered significantly regulated genes. Genes
whose spots are called unreliable by JCVI were subsequently removed. The microarray data was deposited in
NCBIs
Gene
Expression
Omnibus
http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/ under the accession
number GSE17912.
Genes considered significantly upregulated and analyzable were then analyzed by the self-organizing map clustering algorithm of Acuity software. To display expression
patterns of the significantly regulated genes graphically, a
heat map image file correlating the log ratio of expression
at each time point to colour intensity, where yellow and
blue colours correspond to up- and down-regulated
genes, respectively, was generated.
Analysis of regulated processes was performed using
the main role and subrole categories assigned to the 7200
M. xanthus DK1622 protein coding sequences by J. Craig
Venter Institute (JCVI) (formerly TIGR). Genes for which
no role category had been assigned by JCVI were termed
hypothetical and genes assigned to more than one role
category were examined individually, and assigned to one
category based on blast analysis (R. Hedderich) (Additional file 2). 692 Mxans were that were not represented
on the arrays either because they were not included on
the .gal file, were subsequently documented as unreliable
by JCVI, or were prefiltered out during data analysis were
removed from the subsequent analyses. The number of
genes either considered not significantly regulated, or significantly up-(class I), up-(class II), or down-regulated in

Müller et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:264
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/264

each main role category were represented as a percent of
the total genes in that category that were represented as
reliable on the chip. Genes assigned to the main role categories "disrupted reading frame" and "extrachromosomal
elements" were not included in the analysis. The Pearson's Chi squared test or Fischer's Exact Test (expect categories < 5) http://www.langsrud.com/fisher.htm were
used to determine the probability that the proportion of
regulated genes in each category could have happened by
chance. The CELLO subcellular localization predictor
[74]http://cello.life.nctu.edu.tw/ was used to predict the
subcellular localization of the proteins encoded by each
M. xanthus gene.
Real-time PCR analysis

Real-time PCR was performed in a 26 μl reaction volume
using SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems)
and 0.2 μM primers specific to the target gene in a 7300
Real Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). Template
cDNA for real-time PCR analysis was generated from 1
μg DNA-free RNA (prepared as described above for
micrarray analysis) and reverse transcribed into cDNA
using random hexamer primers (Amersham) and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a 20 ul
reaction according to manufacture's instructions.
Because an endogenous control for cDNA generation (ie
constitutively expressed marker gene) is not known for
M. xanthus cells undergoing development or differentiation, real-time PCR reactions were performed using
equivalent amounts of starting RNA as described previously [72,75-77]. The optimal cDNA template dilution
used in real-time PCR reactions was chosen which
yielded a cycle threshold (Ct) value after 25-30 cycles and
was determined for each gene target individually; equivalent dilutions were used for a time course. For each cDNA
sample, a control reaction was performed on an equivalent starting volume of RNA to be certain no contaminating DNA was present, and genomic DNA was used as a
positive control. Each reaction was performed in duplicate, and the average Ct value from the uninduced vegetative cells (T = 0) was subtracted from the average Ct
values at each time point (T = 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 hours after
induction) in order to present the expression relative to
the uninduced vegetative sample (T = 0). Each profile was
analyzed independently at least twice.
Real-time-PCR cycle conditions were as follows: 95°C
10 min, 95°C 15 sec, 40 cycles of 60°C 1 min and 95°C 15
sec. Melting and dissociation curves were determined at
60°C 30 sec and 95°C 15 sec. Ct values for each reaction
were assigned automatically by the system software (7300
System SDS software v1.2.3).
Target specific primers were initially tested for product
specificity by PCR using genomic DNA as a template.
Each primer pair was then tested for PCR efficiencies

Page 16 of 20

close to 2 by real-time PCR analysis on a standard curve
generated from four 10-fold serial dilutions of genomic
DNA. Average Ct values from duplicate reactions were
plotted versus the log of the target copy number. PCR
efficiencies (E) for each primer pair were then determined from the slope of the associated regression curve
(m) using the equation: E = 10^-(1/m). Only primer pairs
with efficiency close to 2 were used. Target specific primers for real-time PCR analysis are listed in Additional file
4.
Construction of mutants

Plasmids and mutant strains used in this study are listed
in Additional file 3. Complete deletion of the nfs locus
was generated by homologous recombination using the
pBJ114 kanamycin selection/galK counter-selection plasmid as described previously [78,79]. To generate pFM20
[pBJ114 Δ(nfsA-H)], approximately 500 bp upstream and
downstream from nfsA and nfsH, respectively, were separately amplified and fused by overlap PCR. The resulting
approximately 1000 bp fragment was digested with KpnI
and HindIII and ligated into the corresponding sites of
pBJ114. To generate pAL4 (PnfsA::mCherry), pSL8 was
digested with HindIII and NdeI to remove the PpilA::gfp
insert and generate a backbone vector consisting of the
kanamycin resistance selection marker and the Mx8 attP
sequence. A 323 bp fragment containing the putative promoter sequence upstream from the fist codon of nfsA was
PCR amplified from genomic DNA with primers containing HindIII and NdeI restriction sites and ligated into the
corresponding sites in the vector backbone. The mCherry
gene was subsequently PCR amplified from the plasmid
pXCHYN-1[80] such that 5' NdeI and 3' PstI sites were
incorporated and cloned behind the nfs promoter region
into the respective sites of the pSL8 PnfsA plasmid. To generate pAL8, pAL4 was digested with HindIII and KpnI to
remove the PnfsA::mCherry insert and replace it with a
PnfsD::mCherry insert. The PnfsD::mCherry insert was generated by overlap PCR in which the 964 bp upstream of
the reassigned predicted start codon of nfsD (codon 18 of
the existing annotation) was fused to the second codon of
the mCherry gene such that 5' HindIII and 3' KpnI restriction sites were incorporated. To generate pFM17, the
kanamycin resistance in pAL4 was replaced by the tetracycline resistance cassette from pSWU30. To generate
pFM16 (PpilA::mCherry), the pilA promoter was first PCR
amplified from pSL8 such that a 5 'HindIII site and a 3'
region complementary to the 5' mCherry sequence were
incorporated. Next, the mCherry gene was PCR amplified
from pAL4 such that a 5' region complementary to the 3'
end of the pilA promoter and a 3' NdeI site were incorporated. The two fragments were fused by overlap extension
PCR and ligated into a HindIII/NdeI sites of pAL4. To

generate the empty control vector pFM18, pSL8 was
digested with EcoRI and XbaI, treated with DNA polymerase I (Klenow) to generate blunt ends and then religated. To generate pFM44 (pCR2.1-exo), a 311 bp internal
fragment of the Mxan_3227 gene (exo) was amplified by
PCR and cloned into PCR2.1 TOPO® vector (Invitrogen).
M. xanthus strain PH1244 was generated by electroporating pFM44 into DK1622 and selecting for homologous
recombination into the Mxan_3227 gene by resistance to
kanamycin. Strains PH1220 (PnfsA::mCherry), PH1227,
(PnfsC::mCherry), PH1221 (PpilA::mCherry), and PH1222
(vector), were generated transforming DK1622 with
pAL4, pAL8, pFM16, and pFM18, respectively, such that
the plasmids integrated in the genomic Mx8 phage attB
site by site specific recombination were selected by resistance to kanamycin. Strains PH1223 (devR
PnfsA::mCherry), PH1224 (fruA PnfsA::mCherry) and
PH1225 (exo PnfsA::mCherry) were generated by transforming strains DK5279, DK11063, and PH1244, respectively, with pFM17, as above with oxytetracycline
selection. Strain PH1226 was generated by transforming
strain DK5208 with pAL4, as above with kanamycin
selection. Correct integration of all plasmids was confirmed by PCR using a primers specific to plasmid and
genomic DNA for integration via homologous recombination, and by primers specific to the attB/attP region for
site specific recombination [81].
Analysis of glycerol induced-development

To determine efficiency of glycerol-induced sporulation,
cells were cultivated in CTT media and induced at an
OD550 of 0.5 with glycerol to a final concentration of 0.5
M. At the indicated time points, 10 ml cells were harvested, pelleted at 4 620 × g, resuspended in 10 ml sterile
water, incubated at 50°C for 2 hours, and then sonciated
three times 30 pulses, output 3, 50% duty in ice water
with a Branson sonifier and microtip. Surviving spores
from 10 μl of the treated samples were enumerated in a
Thoma cell counting chamber (Hawksley, Lancing, UK).
Mutant sporulation efficiencies are represented as percent of wild type spores. Spore viability was determined
by pouring 10-fold serial dilutions of heat- and sonication
treated cells suspended in CTT soft agar onto CTT agar
plates. The resulting colonies arising from germination of
spores were counted after 5, 10 and 14 days of incubation
at 32°C. Mutant spore viability was calculated as percent
of wild type germinating spores.
Analysis of M. xanthus starvation induced-developmental
phenotypes

Starvation-induced development was assayed on nutrient-limited clone-fruiting (CF) agar plates [82], as
described previously [83]. Briefly, cells were grown to
mid-log phase in CTT broth, washed, resuspended to an

Page 17 of 20

OD550 of 7 in MMC starvation medium, and 10 μl of cells
was spotted onto CF plates and incubated at 32°C. Developmental phenotypes were recorded at the times indicated with a Leica MZ8 stereomicroscope and attached
Leica DFC320 camera. Development was induced under
submerged culture conditions as described previously
[84].
Analysis of mCherry reporter fusions

Strains were developed in submerged culture in black 24well glass bottom plates (Greiner Bio-One). At the indicated time points, fluorescence signal intensity was measured at 615 nm wavelength in a plate reader (Tecan
Infinite M200). Signals from cell-free, buffer containing
wells were subtracted from signals of developing cultures
to calculate absolute fluorescence intensities. Proper
development was checked at each time point using a stereo microscope. All experiments were carried out in triplicate.
Separation of peripheral rods from fruiting body spores
was performed as described previously [9], except development was induced under submerged culture conditions, and cells were harvested at 36 hours development.
For fluorescence microscopy, cells were spotted on
Agar pads (1% (w/v) agarose in A50 starvation buffer (10
mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 50 mM
NaCl) covered with a cover slip and examined under a
Zeiss Axio Imager.M1 microscope. mCherry-specific fluorescence signals were detected at 670 nm wavelength.
Images were recorded with an EM-CCD Cascade 1 K
(Photometrics, Tucson) camera, and images were processed with Metamorph ver7.5.
