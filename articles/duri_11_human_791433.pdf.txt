Abstract
Background: Expensive CD4 count and viral load tests have failed the intended objective of enabling access to
HIV therapy in poor resource settings. It is imperative to develop simple, affordable and non-subjective disease
monitoring tools to complement clinical staging efforts of inexperienced health personnel currently manning most
healthcare centres because of brain drain. Besides accurately predicting HIV infection, sequential appearance of
specific bands of WB test offers a window of opportunity to develop a less subjective tool for monitoring disease
progression.
Methods: HIV type characterization was done in a cohort of infected pregnant women at 36 gestational weeks
using WB test. Student-t test was used to determine maternal differences in mean full blood counts and viral load
of mothers with and those without HIV gag antigen bands. Pearson Chi-square test was used to assess differences
in lack of bands appearance with vertical transmission and lymphadenopathy.
Results: Among the 64 HIV infected pregnant women, 98.4% had pure HIV-1 infection and one woman (1.7%) had
dual HIV-1/HIV-2 infections. Absence of HIV pol antigen bands was associated with acute infection, p = 0.002. All
women with chronic HIV-1 infection had antibody reactivity to both the HIV-1 envelope and polymerase antigens.
However, antibody reactivity to gag antigens varied among the women, being 100%, 90%, 70% and 63% for p24,
p17, p39 and p55, respectively. Lack of antibody reactivity to gag p39 antigen was associated with disease
progression as confirmed by the presence of lymphadenopathy, anemia, higher viral load, p = 0.010, 0.025 and
0.016, respectively. Although not statistically significant, women with p39 band missing were 1.4 times more likely
to transmit HIV-1 to their infants.
Conclusion: Absence of antibody reactivity to pol and gag p39 antigens was associated with acute infection and
disease progression, respectively. Apart from its use in HIV disease diagnosis, WB test could also be used in
conjunction with simpler tests like full blood counts and patient clinical assessment as a relatively cheaper disease
monitoring tool required prior to accessing antiretroviral therapy for poor resource settings. However, there is also
need to factor in the role of host-parasite genetics and interactions in disease progression.

Background
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is currently one of the most devastating diseases caused by
HIV. Globally, in 2007 alone, 33 million people were living with HIV/AIDS and 20 million had died [1]. Studies
have shown a cross-species transmission of HIV from a
primate lentivirus to humans and the virus can be phylogenetically classified into two types; 1 and 2 [2]. This
distinction is essential for accurate surveillance and
diagnosis as well as administration of appropriate antiretroviral therapies within a population.
HIV type 1 (HIV-1) is the first in the class of human
retroviruses and accounts for more than 95% of the
world’s HIV infections. Its origin can be traced back to a
Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) isolated from a
Chimpanzee (cpz) sub-species, Pan troglodytes troglodytes (SIVcpz)[3]. Both HIV-1 and SIVcpz have a unique
Vpu gene in their respective genomic structures [2].
HIV-2 is the second in the same class and is largely confined to West Africa. Its closest relative is a monkey,
sooty mangabey (sm), Cercocebus atys, SIVsm. A unique
Vpx gene characterises both viruses’ gene structures
[4,5]. However, HIV-2 and HIV-1/HIV2 co-infections
have also been documented outside West Africa [6].
HIV-1 and HIV-2 are closely related viruses with nucleotide sequence homology of 58%, 59% and 39% in the
group specific antigen (Gag), Pol and Env genes encoding
the viral nucleocapsid, polymerase enzymes and envelope
glycoproteins, respectively [7]. Relative to HIV-1, HIV-2
has a reduced rate of transmissibility, disease development and has shown natural resistance to readily available non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors [8,9].
Classical algorithm of laboratory diagnosis of HIV
infection has been the detection of anti-HIV antibodies
using rapid tests with WB immunoassay as the gold standard method for validating screening test results [10,11].
However, in Zimbabwe, a large proportion of HIV diagnoses are currently being done without WB confirmation
yet its banding profiles can yield valuable patient information. In this setting, WB test is only used as a tiebreaker in cases of discrepancy in the results. Unlike
screening tests that detect antibodies to one or all HIV
antigen(s) without specifying which antigen reacts to
which antibody, the WB test with separated viral proteins
immobilized on a membrane, generates specific information on the reactivity of patient antibodies to specific
HIV antigens. Positive reactions appear as bands of
numerous patterns [12]. Variations in WB band intensities, numbers, or their sequential order of appearance
during different stages of HIV infection have been
observed [13]. Following sero-conversion, anti-gag antibodies to p17, p24 and its precursor p55 appear first and
tend to decrease with the onset of clinical symptoms
[14]. A reduced prevalence of core antibodies has also

Page 2 of 8

been shown to be associated with the development of
immunodeficiency [15]. In contrast, antibodies to env
antigens have been detected in virtually all HIV infected
persons regardless of clinical stage [16]. This sequential
appearance of specific WB bands offers a window of
opportunity to develop a simple and non-subjective disease assessment tool and also to predict the likelihood of
vertical transmission.
High cost of CD4 count and viral load tests has hampered the intended objective of accessing HIV therapy
in poor resource settings. Hence, there is a need for
alternative initiative towards development of simple,
accurate, affordable and non subjective disease monitoring tools. In view of the current brain drain challenge,
this development would complement clinical staging
efforts of inexperienced health personnel currently manning most healthcare centres.
WB test has been in use in Zimbabwe for some time
now, mainly for HIV diagnosis. However, critical analysis of the band profiles regarding their additional potential applications has been overlooked. This study aimed
to characterize HIV types among pregnant women using
the WB test and to determine whether the presence or
absence of particular band(s) correlated with HIV-1 disease progression or predicted vertical transmission.

Methods
Study Design and Setting

This was a nested case-control study in which the cases
and controls were sampled from a cohort of pregnant
women attending 3 antenatal clinics around the city of
Harare, Zimbabwe. All participants were part of a
national Prevention of Mother-To-Child Transmission
(PMTCT) program and were naïve to antiretroviral
therapy. The primary end point was an HIV-1 positive
mother who transmitted the virus to her infant, transmitting mother (case). Each case was matched to one
HIV-1 positive but non-transmitting mother (control).
Matching of cases and controls was done with respect
to important risk factors of HIV disease progression and
vertical transmission notably maternal age, baseline
sexually transmitted infections (STIs), clinical signs, the
date of last menstruation and single dose nevirapine
therapy, see figure 1.
Study Population and Procedures

Pregnant women were enrolled at 36 gestational weeks
between April and September 2002. Pre-and post-HIV
test counseling services were readily available. HIV-1
positive mother and infant pairs were offered 200 mg
single dose nevirapine during labour and 2 mg/kg body
weight within 72 hours post delivery, respectively.
Mothers were encouraged to exclusively breastfeed during the first six months post-delivery.

Figure 1 Summary of how the 32 Transmitters and 32 non-Transmitters were sampled from a cohort of pregnant mothers attending
antenatal clinics around Harare.

The study population consisted of two groups of pregnant HIV-1 positive women. The main group consisted
of pregnant women who were HIV-1 positive at enrolment, considered to be having chronic HIV-1 infection,
and a subgroup of pregnant women who were HIV-1
negative during pregnancy but sero-converted after delivery, thus regarded as having acute HIV-1 infection. Follow-up of HIV-1 negative mothers together with HIV-1
exposed infants was from delivery, 6 weeks, 4 and 9
months and thereafter 3 monthly until 2 years, thus generally coinciding with infant immunization visits. At each
subsequent follow-up visit, HIV-1 negative mothers and
exposed infants were re-tested for HIV-1 antibodies and
antigens, respectively. Besides HIV testing, serum samples of sero-negative mothers and their respective infants
were aliquoted and stored for further analysis.
Mothers’ and Infants’ Demographic characteristics,
Examination and sample collection

At enrolment all mothers answered a structured questionnaire and information regarding their socio-demographics,

sexual behavioural, obstetric and reproductive health
issues was obtained. A gynecologist performed physical
and gynecological examinations.
A pediatrician examined infants. Date of birth, birth
weight, gender and single dose nevirapine therapy were
recorded. Five milliliters of maternal venous blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes at baseline and each
follow-up visit in the cases of HIV-1 negative mothers.
Two milliliters of venous EDTA whole blood samples
were collected at each follow-up visit for HIV-1 negative
but HIV-1 exposed infants. Samples were stored at
-86°C until tested.
Mothers’ Tests

Serial HIV-1/-2 algorithm antibody tests were performed on plasma samples using Determine (Abbott
Diagnostics, Illinois USA) and Ora-Quick (Abbott Diagnostics, Illinois, USA) rapid kits. Confirmation of
screening HIV-1/2 rapid test results was done at the
Norwegian Institute of Public Health using the WB test
(HIV blot 2.2, MP Diagnostics, Singapore) according to

Duri et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:7
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/11/7

the manufacturer’s instructions. Interpretation of the
WB test results was done in line with the World Health
Organization guidelines [17]. A WB test was considered
positive if at least two of the three envelope antigen
bands for HIV-1 or glycoprotein (gp) 36 for HIV-2 and
any of the four gag antigens or at least any one of the
three pol antigens were present. A WB test result was
considered to show dual reactivity when sera reacted
with at least two env glyco-proteins and one core protein of each virus. Specimens with reactive gp36 antigen
were re-run on a WB test specific to HIV-2.
Full blood counts were done using Abbott Diagnostic
Cell Dyne 3500R SL Hematology Analyser. Plasma samples
were shipped on dry ice to the Institute of Microbiology in
Oslo to be quantified for HIV-1 RNA load using an automated TaqMan Roche Amplicor 1.5 Monitor Test (Cobas
AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan, Roche Diagnostics, Branchburg NJ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions as
previously described [18]. The first available HIV-1 positive
sample was quantified in the cases of sero-converters.
Infants’ Test

Detection of infants’ HIV-1 infections was performed
using qualitative 1.5 Roche Amplicor HIV-1 DNA PCR
kit (Roche Diagnostics). Since this was a breastfeeding
population, the criteria used to determine time of infection was similar to that used by Bertolli et al. [19].
Infants that tested HIV-1 DNA PCR positive on whole
blood collected within 10 days of birth were considered
to be infected in utero. Infants who had negative HIV-1
DNA PCR results within the first 10 days of life but had
positive results at six weeks were regarded as infected
during intra-partum and those testing positive thereafter
were considered infected after birth.
Statistical Analysis

Data were entered and analyzed using STATA version
10. The frequency of WB bands were determined among
the pregnant women in general and also after stratifying
by the time of HIV infection (acute or chronic) and vertical transmission, as transmitting or non-transmitting
mothers. A graph was plotted to show the frequency of
different WB gag antigen bands between the two groups
of mothers. Student-t test was used to determine differences in mean viral load and maternal hemoglobin
between mothers with and those without gag antigen
bands. Pearson Chi-square test was used to assess differences in the absence HIV gag antigen bands with vertical
transmission and lymphadenopathy. Comparisons of the
appearance of the HIV env, pol and gag antigens band
profiles of mothers with chronic and those with acute
HIV-1 infections were also done. Tests of statistical significance included the 95% confidence intervals of unadjusted relative risks and p values of less than 0.05 were
considered statistically significant.

Ethical Consideration

The study was approved by the Medical Research Council of Zimbabwe and the Ethical Review Committee of
Norway. Written consent to participate in the research
study was obtained from the mothers and they were free
to discontinue at any given time without any prejudice.

Results
Demography and Reproductive Health Characteristics of
the 58 mothers: 29 transmitting and their 29 matched
non-transmitting mothers with chronic HIV infection

Mean age (standard deviation) of the women was 26.6
(5.2) years, being 26.3 (5.6) and 25.6 (5.6) years for transmitters and non-transmitters respectively, p = 0.610.
All the women had at least 7 years in school and were
not formally employed. Ninety-three percent were married and 90% had at least one child. All the mothers had
spontaneous vaginal deliveries and were generally
asymptomatic for HIV infection at enrolment.
There were two stillbirths, one among the HIV-1
positive and the other within the HIV negative group.
These two were excluded from analysis. From the 176
HIV-1 positive mothers that delivered live births 126
(72%) mother-baby pairs were successfully followed up
and tested. There were no differences with respect to
socio-demographic characteristics, sexual behavior,
reproductive genital tract infections and medical history
between the 58 mothers with chronic HIV-1 infection
constituting the main group in this study population
and the rest of the mothers were HIV-1 positive at
enrolment but were excluded or lost to follow-up. However, these 58 mothers were more likely to have more
children, p = 0.016.
HIV Prevalence, Types and Vertical Transmission of the 29
Transmitting and their Matched 29 Non-Transmitting
Mothers with Chronic Infection

At baseline 691 pregnant women were enrolled of whom
177 (25.6%) and 514 (74.4%) were HIV-1 sero-positive
and sero-negative, respectively. Performance concordance of the two serial HIV-1 rapid test results was
100%. Confirmatory WB tests of the 58 women with
chronic HIV infection showed a 98.3% pure HIV-1 infection. None was found with solely HIV-2 infection. Only
one woman (1.7%) had dual HIV-1/HIV-2 infections.
Twenty nine (23%) mothers transmitted the virus to
their infants 10 (34%) and 19 (66%) during in utero and
intra-partum/postpartum transmissions respectively.
HIV Incidence, Type(s) and vertical transmission among 6
sero-converters: 3 transmitting and 3 non-transmitting
mothers

Out of the 512 HIV-1 negative mothers that delivered
live births, 24 sero-converted during the two year

Duri et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:7
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/11/7

follow-up period, giving an HIV-1 incidence rate of 2.3
per hundred women years. Eighty-five percent of the
mothers sero-converted after weaning their infants from
breast-milk. Mothers with acute HIV-1 infections were
generally younger relative to HIV-1 negative mothers in
the cohort, with mean ages of 21.8 (4.6) and 23.7(5)
years respectively, p = 0.06. More so, sero-converters
were generally younger compared with mothers having
chronic HIV-1 infection, mean (SD) ages, 21.8(4.6) and
26(5.5) years respectively, p = 0.04. There were no differences with respect to level of education, age of sexual
debut, reproductive tract infections and STIs between
the mothers with acute and those with chronic HIV-1
infections.
Among the 24 sero-converters with acute HIV-1
infection, three (13%) transmitted the virus to their
infants through breastfeeding around 9 months postpartum. All the three infants were exposed, through breast
milk for about three months before acquiring HIV-1
infection. All the sero-converting mothers had solely
HIV-1 infection. Neither HIV-2 nor HIV-1/HIV-2 coinfections were detected in this subgroup.
Frequency of HIV-1 WB Bands among 58 mothers with
chronic HIV infection

Reactivity to all the 10 WB HIV-1 proteins was observed
in 78% of the HIV-1 positive women. All specimens
showed a strong positive reaction to both the HIV-1
envelope glycoproteins (gp160, gp120 and gp41) and the
polymerase antigens (p31, p51 and p66). However, antibody reactivity to the gag core antigens varied among
the women, being 100%, 90%, 70% and 63% with the
p24, p17, p39 and p55 respectively. Absence of maternal

Page 5 of 8

antibody reactivity to HIV-1 gag demonstrated no
relationship with maternal age, marital status, age of
sexual debut, the number of sexual partners the women
had had, current nor history of STIs.
Gag p39 and p55 antigens were the most commonly
missing bands among transmitting mothers. Generally
band appearance was not significantly different when
compared with band profiles of the non-transmitting
mothers, see figure 2. Mothers who had gag p39 antigen
bands missing were 1.4 times more likely to transmit
the virus to their infants compared to those who had
this band present though their number was too small to
reach statistical significance, p = 0.104.
Lack of antibody reactivity to gag p39 antigen was significantly associated with disease progression as demonstrated by the presence of maternal lymphadenopathy,
anaemia and higher viral load, p = 0.010, 0.025 and 0.016
respectively, see table 1. Women with p39 gag antigen
band missing were about 6 times more likely to have a
viral load of more than 10 000 copies/mL relative to their
counterparts who had that band present, 5.58 [1.74-17.86].
Presence of gag p17 antigen band was associated with
established or advanced HIV-1 infection in mothers
with chronic HIV-1 infection p = 0.002, see table 2.
Frequency of HIV WB Bands among mothers with acute
HIV-1 infection

All the mothers with acute HIV-1 infection had antibody reactivity to all the 3 env antigens, gp41, 120 and
160. However, reactivity to HIV-1 gag antigens varied,
but because of the small number of women in this subgroup, it was difficult to make any conclusive remarks.
Lack of antibody reactivity to pol antigens, p31, p51 or

WB band Profiles of the mother with HIV-1/-2 co-infection

In addition to the weak HIV-2 specific p36 band, reactivity to all the env, pol and gag antigens was observed.
The mother was generally well with a relatively low
baseline viral load of 690 viral copies per mL and did
not transmit the viruses to her baby.

Discussion
This study is a first attempt to correlate simple WB
band profiles with disease progression and to some
extent vertical transmission in Zimbabwe. The WB test
is simple and easily interpreted by skilled users.

Nevertheless, rapid tests are even simpler and can be
conducted in rural settings without electricity. Although
WB test remains relatively more expensive compared to
rapid tests, it could be worthwhile using provided it
yields a wealth of information on patients’ serology.
Besides accurately predicting HIV infection, sequential
appearance of specific bands on WB test result offers a
window of opportunity to develop a less subjective tool
to monitor disease progression.
In our study of pregnant women recruited around
Harare, HIV 1 was the predominant type with only one
HIV-1/HIV-2 co-infected mother. This observation is in
agreement with a previous bigger study, coincidentally
also done in Harare in the same population that showed
an HIV-2 and HIV-1/HIV-2 prevalence of 1.3% and
0.5%, respectively [20].
A recent study has shown that serological cross-reactivity for HIV-2 in HIV-1 infected individuals is rare
when using synthetic peptide based assays which was
the case with the MP Diagnostic HIV BLOT 2.2 kit we
used in our study [21]. Similar to the findings of the
same study, a weak reactivity to gp36 band was observed
in the co-infected mother. However, a more specific
HIV-2 PCR should have been done to confirm the HIV2 immuno-blot test result. With the world fast becoming a global village, the possibility of importing and/or
exporting new HIV types is inevitable, more so for most
unemployed Zimbabweans who have resorted to crossborder trading with regional countries such as Mozambique and Angola with HIV-2.
Antibodies to the env and pol antigens were well
detected in all the HIV infected pregnant women. Similar findings of band reactivities were reported earlier
[13,16,22,23]. These results emphasise the importance of
considering both the env and pol antigens in the interpretation criteria of WB HIV positive test results at least

Duri et al. BMC Infectious Diseases 2011, 11:7
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2334/11/7

in this population. Antibodies to gag antigens, p17, p39
and p55 were not expressed efficiently in these women
as was the case with other previous related studies
[22,23]. Unlike the Indian study, where p55 antigen
band was not detected at all in the patients with WHO
clinical stage 1, our study observed a 63% expression of
this antigen [22]. Interestingly in our study population,
this antigen was the least expressed of all the WB test
HIV antigens. This difference could be due to the fact
that most of our women had surpassed the WHO clinical stage 1.
Fiebig et al., have classified primary infection of HIV
into seven stages incorporating WB test results. A characteristic band appearance indicative of an indeterminate
test result has been shown to occur at stage IV with a
true positive WB test result at stage V but without the
p31 antigen band which only appears in the final acute
infection stage VI [24]. Also observed in our study
amongst sero-converters, was the absence of reactivity to
pol antigens hence these could be predictors of sero-conversion. Analogous results have also been demonstrated
by Sudha et al., who have shown p31 antigen to be a predictor for early HIV infection [13]. Presence of p17 antigen band was associated with chronic infections and
hence could be a predictor of established HIV infection
contrary to the results observed by some studies [14,15].
Lack of antibody reactivity to p39 and p55 antigens was
associated with disease progression as confirmed by the
presence of lymphadenopathy, anemia, high viral load of
above 10 000 viral RNA copies per mL and a higher likelihood of vertical transmission. Similar findings were also
obtained elsewhere [25].
Without any intervention, majority HIV-1 positive
pregnant women do not transmit the virus to their
infants. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is
not yet readily available in PMTCT programs in
resource limited settings. The long term side effect of
single dose nevirapine therapy offered to most HIV
positive pregnant mothers poses a threat to the health
of the naturally non-transmitting mothers should they
require nevirapine later as part of their antiretroviral
combination therapy. Hence, it is critical to precisely
predict mothers who are likely to vertically transmit and
offer them nevirapine monotherapy. Accurately predicting pregnant mothers likely to transmit the virus to
their infants has long term benefits of saving on drugs
and minimizing drug resistance problems. Lack of antibody reactivity to gag p39 antigen during the last trimester of pregnancy could be a predictor of vertical
transmission although bigger studies are necessary to
verify this observation. The current small sample size
could not permit conditional logistic regression analysis
to control for variables that could have had an effect on
disease progression other than WB band profiles. Hence

Page 7 of 8

results should be interpreted cautiously because disease
progression and transmission also depend on other factors including host-parasite genetics and interaction.
Control of viral replication following infection has been
attributed partly to cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) CD8+
activity. Studies have shown that CTLs directed against
gag antigens correlate with improved clinical markers of
disease progression [26]. Hence absence of antibody
responses to p39 antigen could interfere with normal
host neutralization of virus and may contribute to disease
progression. Missing bands among the HIV chronically
infected women were likely to have been due to diminished antibody responses with progressive disease whilst
in recent sero-convertors the missing bands may have
been due to immature antibody responses or possibly
due to mutations in the pol gene [27].

Conclusion
These data support the rationale of using WB band profiles plus simple laboratory tests like differential counts
together with clinical symptoms such as lymphadenopathy in establishing and evaluating disease progression
before accessing antiretroviral therapy. This could have
important practical applications especially in resource
poor settings, where over 95% of the 40 million HIV
infected people live, who unfortunately cannot afford
costly viral load and CD4 cell tests. However, bigger studies are necessary to shed more light on the use of simple WB band profiles to determine the likelihood of
vertical transmission as an initiative to reduce HIV-1
vertical transmission in developing countries.
