Abstract
Background: Minisatellites are genomic loci composed of tandem arrays of short repetitive DNA segments. A
minisatellite map is a sequence of symbols that represents the tandem repeat array such that the set of symbols is in
one-to-one correspondence with the set of distinct repeats. Due to variations in repeat type and organization as well
as copy number, the minisatellite maps have been widely used in forensic and population studies. In either domain,
researchers need to compare the set of maps to each other, to build phylogenetic trees, to spot structural variations,
and to study duplication dynamics. Efficient algorithms for these tasks are required to carry them out reliably and in
reasonable time.
Results: In this paper we present WAMI, a web-server for the analysis of minisatellite maps. It performs the above
mentioned computational tasks using efficient algorithms that take the model of map evolution into account. The
WAMI interface is easy to use and the results of each analysis task are visualized.
Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, WAMI is the first server providing all these computational facilities to the
minisatellite community. The WAMI web-interface and the source code of the underlying programs are available at
http://www.nubios.nileu.edu.eg/tools/wami.
Background

Applications of minisatellite map analysis

Minisatellite maps

Minisatellite maps have manifold applications in forensics and population studies. Foster et al. [1] used minisatellite maps to resolve the dispute on the fatherhood of
President Jefferson to a son of his slave. They showed that
Jefferson is the biological father of her last son, but not
her first son as thought before. Based on the MS205 dataset, Armour et al. [2] confirmed the African origin for
modern humans, Alonso et al. [3] proved a European
affiliation for the Basques, and Rogers et al. [4] dated the
Eurasian population as 52000-66000 years and the oldest
European as 37600-56200 years. Using the MSY1 dataset,
which was first investigated by Jobling et al. [5], Brión et
al. [6] showed that European lineages are more similar
than North African ones. Bonhomme et al. [7] used
minisatellites to study house mouse population and provided a migration map for them. Very recently, Yuan et al.
[8] used the MS32 minisatellites to study the population
specificity among Thai, Chinese, and Japanese. They
showed that the MS32 minisatellite is an effective tool to
distinguish individuals from these populations.
The functional and medical roles of minisatellites have
also been addressed in many studies for the last two

A DNA region is categorized as a minisatellite locus if it is
composed of tandemly repeated DNA stretches and
spans more than 500 bp. Each of these stretches is called
a unit and it holds (by most definitions) 10-100 bp. The
units are not necessarily identical due to point mutations,
and their number and organization may vary among individuals as a result of subsequent evolutionary events. The
variant repeat mapping by PCR (MVR-PCR) is a popular
technique to reveal the structure of a minisatellite locus
as it enables unit typing and minisatellite map production. Unit typing is the classification of the variable units
into distinct types (called variants and denoted by different symbols) according to their DNA sequences. A
minisatellite map is a compact representation of the
minisatellite locus, where each unit is replaced with the
respective symbol. Figure 1(a) shows an example of a
minisatellite locus and the respective map.

decades, and the interest increases with more individual
genomes becoming available. To mention a few examples,
Thierry et al. [9] discovered a class of minisatellites
involved in cell adhesion and pathogenicity. Vafiadis et al.
[10] proved that the Insulin minisatellite plays an important role in the regulation of Insulin and the authors of
[11,12] showed that it is associated with polycystic ovary
syndrome, obesity, and type I diabetes. Raeder et al. [13]
showed that the mutations in the CEL minisatellite is correlated with exocrine dysfunction in diabetic patients.
Tsuge et al. conjectured that polymorphisms in minisatellites at the flanking region of SMYD3 are susceptible risk
factors for human cancer [14]. For more studies, we refer
the reader to the review of Vergnaud and Denoeud [15]
and the WikiGenes page in [16].
Computational challenges in minisatellite analysis

Researchers analyzing minisatellite maps usually perform
the following computational tasks:
1. Comparison of minisatellite maps by computing all
pairwise alignments.
2. Construction of a phylogenetic tree based on all
pairwise distances, to show the relatedness between
the involved individuals.
3. Studying structural variations, to examine how the
unit types vary and distribute along a minisatellite
map.
4. Studying duplication dynamics, to infer the type
from which the map originated and in which direction the map elongates.
Recent studies often relied either on visual inspection
or on heuristic methods. To our surprise, most did not
make use of the recent advancement in the bioinformatics methods developed for pairwise map comparison
[17,18]. We think this situation is mainly due to the lack
of both web-servers and open source tools performing
the aforementioned tasks. To the best of our knowledge,

there is currently just one server, called MS_ALIGN
(http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/ms_align/) for minisatellite map comparison [17]. It is, however, limited to computing all pair-wise alignments, with no post-processing
and visualization of map alignments.
In this paper, we present the web server WAMI for the
analysis of minisatellite maps. The server uses a recent
algorithm for map alignment, improved over the one in
MS_ALIGN, and provides a workflow for the execution
of the four computational tasks mentioned above, including visualization. These capabilities are demonstrated
here by the analysis of the MSY1 [19] and MS205 [2-4,20]
datasets.

Implementation
Model of minisatellite map evolution and alignment

Minisatellite maps can be studied in an independent or a
comparative fashion. In the former, a map is analyzed to
identify the evolutionary history that gave rise to the
observed sequence of units. In the latter, two maps are
aligned together to figure out regions of common and
individual evolution histories. However, both tasks are
entangled, since a region of individual evolution, juxtaposed to a gap in the map alignment, must have a plausible individual history. This makes minisatellite map
alignment algorithmically more challenging than the
standard sequence alignment problem.
Map evolution

Our evolutionary model of minisatellite maps includes
the following operations acting on the unit level:
• Unit mutation: This is the change of one unit type
into another. For example, the unit b in the map abd
mutates into c leading to the map acd. The unit
mutation is a consequence of point mutations (substitution and indels) acting on the DNA sequence of the
units. In the example of Figure 1, the differences
between the three unit types are attributed to nucleotide substitutions.
• Duplication: Duplication (also known as expansion
or amplification) is the generation of new copies of
the units by tandem duplications. Replication slippage, reciprocal exchange (unequal crossover or
unequal sister chromatid exchange), and gene conversion (including synthesis-dependent strand annealing, abbreviated by SDSA) are potential mechanisms
for unit duplications. The first is suggested for short
segments while the others are for long ones; see [2125] for more details. Figure 1(b) illustrates the
unequal cross over mechanism, where the paired
homologous chromosomes exchange unequal segments during the cell division. This results in the
duplication of the unit b in one chromosome and the
deletion (contraction) of it in the other. The singlecopy duplication model assumes that one unit can

Abouelhoda et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:167
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/167

duplicate at a time while the multiple-copy duplication model assumes that multiple adjacent units can
duplicate at a time. For example, the adjacent units bc
in the map abbc can duplicate in one event, leading
to the map abbcbc.
• Insertion/Deletion: Insertion is the appearance of
unit types, possibly due to errors or translocation
events. For example, insertion of unit z in the map ac
leads to the map azc. A dual operation to insertion is
deletion where one unit disappears, leading also to
map contraction. Potential mechanisms for these
events include the ones mentioned above except for
replication slippage.
Each of these operations is assigned a cost to reflect the
relative rate at which it occurs in nature. The cost of a
unit mutation is proportional to the Hamming/edit distance between the nucleotide sequences of the units. We
write dM(x,y) to denote this cost between two units x and
y. (Of course, dM(x,y) = 0 if x = y.) In Figure 1, dM(a,b) = 1
because of one mismatch at the last nucleotide, and
dM(a,c) = 2 because of mismatches at the fourth and the
last nucleotide. The costs of duplication, insertion, and
deletion are arbitrary and usually chosen such that the
duplication is less than the mutation, deletion and insertion cost.
Reconstruction of evolutionary history

The evolutionary history of a map is the series of evolutionary operations leading to the observed sequence of
units. This history is also called duplication history,
because the duplication is the main event contributing to
map evolution. The cost of a duplication history is the
total cost of the occurring operations. An optimal (most
parsimonious) history is one with the minimal cost. For
example, one history of the map bcaccbb originated
from the leftmost unit b is as follows: The leftmost unit b
duplicated three times to the right leading to the sub-map
bbbb. Then the second b mutates into c leading to the
sub-map bcbb. The unit c duplicates two times to the
right producing the sub-map bcccbb. The second c
mutates into a and the last c duplicates once again to the
right leading to the final observed map. Assuming that
dM(a,b) = dM(b,c) and dM(a,b) <dM(a,c), we leave it as an
exercise for the reader to verify that this scenario is
indeed an optimal one.
Map alignment

The alignment of the minisatellite maps includes the
operations of replacement (match/mismatch, where mismatch corresponding to mutation), free insertion/deletion (indel), and duplication. Given a cost for each
operation, an optimal alignment is the one of minimum
cost. An efficient algorithm for finding optimal map
alignments is ARLEM [18].

Page 3 of 9

An optimal map alignment delivers a three-stage scenario: The aligned units (match/mismatch) refer to common ancestors, the duplications refer to differences in the
individual duplication histories, and the indels may refer
to errors or translocations. Figure 2 (right), shows an
alignment of two maps where the replaced (matched/
mismatched) characters are put above each other and the
units evolved by duplications are attached to arcs. In this
representation, an arc connecting two identical units corresponds to a duplication event, and an arc connecting
two different units corresponds to a duplication followed
by a mutation. In this alignment, the sub-map bcaccbb
has emerged as a result of duplication/mutation events
from the leftmost unit b. This sub-map is the example
given above in the duplication history, and no indels exist.
Biologically, the map alignment, compared to individual map analysis, provides clues about the timing and
direction of map evolution as well as the type of operation. In the alignment, we can conclude that the replaced
units had appeared before the units evolved by duplications because of inheritance. We can also conclude that
the evolved regions emerged from the inherited units that
occur either on its left or right side. Furthermore, if we
know that one sequence is the ancestor of the other, then
we can distinguish better between the loss and gain of
units, i.e. contraction versus duplication and insertion
versus deletion.
Extension beyond the single-copy model

For WAMI, we extended ARLEM with a simple heuristic
algorithm to account for double-copy duplications, where
at most two different units can duplicate at a time, e.g.,
bcTbcbc. The idea of our algorithm is to pre-process the
map to locate each sub-array of units of the form "xyxy...",
where x ≠ y. We then create a new type X = xy and replace
the units in this array with the new type to yield the array
"XX...". The distance between the new type X and each
original type z is the cost of optimal duplication history of
xy emerged from or contracted to z. The distance
between two new types X = xy and X' = x'y' is the cost of
aligning xy and x'y'. Finally, the alignment algorithm of
ARLEM runs on the transformed map using the new distances between the map units. In WAMI, the use of double copy model is optional, because the single copy
duplication model is already sufficient for many data sets.
Computationally, it is infeasible to infer a history under
the still more general, multiple copy duplication, model
involving arbitrary number of copies [26].
Four tasks supported by WAMI
Fast computation of pairwise map alignment

The basic step in WAMI is the computation of all pairwise alignments of the input maps, uploaded or edited
online in multi-fasta format. The user can use default

of the President Jefferson's dataset is shown. The lower section sets the option for building a phylogenetic tree over the input map. Note that there
are other related tabbed pages, including introduction, web-service, download, and help/Blog pages. Right: The result page of WAMI. The output is
organized into three categories: Alignment, phylogeny, and batch retrieval. In the alignment category, all pairwise alignments can be displayed. Here,
an alignment between maps one and two (given in the left screen shot) is visualized. The replaced (match/mismatch) units are put above each other.
An arc connecting two identical units corresponds to a duplication event, and an arc connecting two different units corresponds to a duplication followed by a mutation events. The sub-map composed of the units " bcaccbb" of the lower sequence emerged from the leftmost unit b of this submap. The duplication history was the one explained in the subsection about duplication history and alignment model. The category showing the phylogenetic tree appears only if this option was set. We provide the tree in text, JPEG (shown image), and PDF format. Finally, we provide a link to a compressed file containing all the input/output files of a WAMI run.

parameters (costs of each operation) or specify other
ones through the use of a cost file uploaded to the server.
The map alignment model implemented by ARLEM
allows that aligned units duplicate either to the left or to
the right. For example, the sub-map dd in the aligned
lower sequence of Figure 2 (right) was originated from
the inherited unit c on the right, where c duplicated to
the left to produce cc, then the leftmost c mutated into d
which eventually duplicated to the left to produce
another d. Previous programs allowed duplication only in
left-to-right direction, where such a scenario cannot be
modeled. This leads to an alignment of higher cost. This
symmetric feature is crucial for studying the direction of
map elongation, discussed below.

Phylogenetic tree construction

WAMI uses the program BIONJ [27] to construct the
phylogenetic tree from the pairwise distances computed
by ARLEM. BIONJ is based on a neighbor joining algorithm. The program njplot [28] is then used to visualize
the tree.
Analysis of structural variation

In studying structural variation, researchers try to identify highly variable regions of the map. Most previous
studies showed that map extremities are more variable
than other map regions, a phenomenon known as
(bi)polar variability [2,5,20]. WAMI can automatically
provide evidence of (bi)polarized variation for a given
dataset based on a scramble (randomization) test.

Abouelhoda et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:167
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/167

The program ARLEM was augmented with an extra
option that determines the location associated with half
of the optimal score in the aligned maps. We call this
location the pivot-point. The rationale of the pivot point
is that if the variations were accumulated at one end, then
the pivot-point would be shifted towards this end. The
pivot-points are calculated for all pairwise alignments
and normalized with respect to the respective sequence
lengths. A histogram for the pivot-points is then generated. To qualify the results, WAMI computes another histogram for a randomized dataset obtained by shuffling
the units in each map of the input dataset. It is expected
that the histogram for uniformly distributed unit types
along the maps is close to the Gaussian distribution, centered around the value 0.5. WAMI produces a single plot
containing the two histograms overlaid on each other.
The results section contains examples of applying this
procedure to MS205 and MSY1 datasets.
Analysis of duplication dynamics

Determining the direction in which the units duplicate is
an interesting issue that can help in inferring the evolutionary processes and the source/origin unit of the map.
For the MSY1 dataset, for example, Jobling et al. [5] conjectured that Type 4 (4a) is the source of the map and
assumed that the units preferably duplicate in the 3' T' 5'
direction. WAMI has a procedure that can test this kind
of hypothesis based on another scramble test.
In ARLEM, units are allowed to duplicate towards the
left or towards the right to achieve the best alignment
score, while accommodating the most parsimonious
series of duplication events. We added an option to
ARLEM to restrict the duplications to originate either
from the leftmost or from the rightmost unit of a map
interval with duplication events. For example, if only the
option imposing left-to-right duplication origin was set,
then the sub-map "dd" in the aligned lower sequence of
Figure 2 (right) could not have been originated from the
unit "c" on its right, leading probably to increased alignment cost under this restriction.
To detect directional bias, WAMI invokes ARLEM
three times on the dataset: 1) with both duplication directions allowed, 2) with only left-to-right duplications
allowed, and 3) with only right-to-left duplications
allowed. The latter two cases tend to yield higher cost
than the first, because the duplications may be forced to
follow a non-parsimonious scenario. Then the number of
alignments in the second invocation with cost higher
than the optimal one (as determined by the first invocation) is counted. Let El denote this number. The analogous number Er for the third invocation is also computed.
A normalized value combining both figures En = (El - Er)/
El + Er) is then computed. The idea is that if El was differ-

Page 5 of 9

ent from Er, and Er was small, then En would converge to +
1, and one could argue that the duplications in the rightto-left direction are almost sufficient to yield alignments
close to the optimal ones. Hence, right-to-left duplications appear preferred in the evolution of the minisatellites at hand. To further validate the results, WAMI runs a
scramble test and computes the normalized En values for
many random datasets, obtained by shuffling the map
units. Finally, the En values are summarized in a histogram and plotted along with a peak representing En of the
original dataset. For random datasets where duplications
to the left and to the right occur in an equal rate, it is
expected that the distribution of En is close to the Gaussian distribution centered around the value zero.
The scramble test is compute intensive, because the
map alignment phase is repeated many times over scrambled datasets of the same size as the original. To speed up
the computation, we use an approximation technique. We
reduce each map to its modular structure, which is the
sequence of distinct units in the map. For example, the
modular structure of the map aaabbc is abc. This is reasonable because transitions between unit types strongly
indicate the direction of duplication. Because the modular structure is typically much shorter than the map, a significant speed up is achieved.
User Interface

WAMI has an easy to use and intuitive interface. The
main web-page contains four examples to help the user
format map data and cost file. (One example is about the
real dataset for the President Jefferson's fatherhood case,
mentioned above. Other two examples about some published maps of the MSY1 [4] and MS205 [2-4,20]. datasets.) Tool tips and a help menu are also provided. For
sustainability of service, we attached a blog to the website, to collect user feedback and learn about new features
requested by the community. A part of the main interface
is shown in Figure 2 (left).
Upon job termination, the user is directed to the results
page, where pairwise alignments are displayed and one
can toggle between them, see Figure 2 (right). The duplication events within optimal alignments are represented
by arcs. The images depicting the alignments are produced based on LaTeX. (The respective Tex files are
included in the batch download). If the phylogeny option
was chosen, the tree in Newick/JPEG/PDF format can be
retrieved. The results of structural variations and duplication dynamics options are summarized and presented
to the user in the form of histograms. For datasets larger
than 50 sequences, the user is prompted to enter an email
address to receive a notification when the job terminates.
All these results can be downloaded as a compressed file.

Computational efficiency

The program ARLEM uses a highly optimized algorithm
for map alignment. It is based on a compression technique to save redundant computations and its speed is
not affected by any increase in the number of types. In
[18], we reported that ARLEM is 18 to 24 times faster
than the previously available algorithm MS_ALIGN,
using real and artificial datasets. For further speed-up,
the options for computing phylogeny, analyzing structure
variations, and duplication dynamics run in parallel over
a computer cluster of four nodes, where each node contains two Quadcore CPUs (2.5 GHz each) with 64 GB
RAM.

Alignment and phylogeny

Table 1 shows the running times for real and artificial
datasets of varying sizes and for different scramble test
parameters. The number of iterations is the number of
random datasets analyzed for studying the directional
bias based on the modular map structure. The number of
iterations based on the non-modular structure is a multiplication of the alignment time. The time for constructing
the phylogenetic trees is not shown in the table, because
it is in the range of seconds, i.e., negligible compared to
other steps. The alignment time of the MSY1 dataset is
higher than that of the MS205 because the average length
of the MSY1 maps is higher than that of the MS205. But
in analysis of directional bias, MS205 takes more time
because the average length of its modular structure is
three times the one of MSY1 with much higher variability, and our approximation technique described above is
less effective for MS205. (The average modular structure
lengths is approximately 13 and 4 for the MS205 and
MSY1, respectively.) The random datasets were generated such that each map has an average length of 80 units
(minimum and maximum are 60 and 100 units, respectively) with average modular structure length of 12 units
to simulate difficult scenarios.
Figure 3 shows two phylogenetic trees produced by
WAMI for a subset of the MS205 and MSY1 datasets. In
these trees, we see that individuals from the same population are clustered together, which is in accordance with
published results [2,3,6].

Running times in minutes on WAMI for the MSY1 and MS205
(haplotype C) datasets. The column titled "Dataset" contains the
dataset used. "Random100", "Random200", and "Random400" are
datasets with 100, 200, and 400 artificial maps, respectively. The
column titled "Num." contains the number of pairwise map
alignments which need to be computed. The column titled "iteration"
includes the number of randomization steps (and hence increased
data size) in the analysis of duplication dynamics. The number of
iterations in the task of analyzing structural variation is 2 because it
runs one time on the original dataset and one time on randomized
dataset of the same size.

Structural variation

We applied WAMI to both datasets to investigate structural variation. When studying structure variation with
MS205, Armour et al. [2,20] noticed polarized variability
at the 3' end, where most of the differences between the
alleles (individual maps) accumulate at the 3' end. Figure
4(a) and 4(b) shows the histograms of the pivot points
obtained for the original MS205 dataset and a subset of it

including haplotype C. It is clear that the histograms of
the original datasets are biased to the right in comparison
to that of a randomized datasets. This bias indicates polar
variability towards the 3' end. These plots confirm the
results obtained by Armour et al. [2]. (The presented
results of MS205 are obtained using the double-copy

option, but the results under the single-copy model are
very similar.)
For the MSY1 dataset, lying on the Y chromosome,
Jobling et al. [5] noticed high variability at the 5' end in
contrast to the autosomal MS205 dataset, and they
noticed also that Types 4 and 4a, existing almost solely at
the 3' side, causes another source of variation at this end.
This suggests bi-polar variability of this dataset. For us it
was interesting to see how WAMI can thus help in spotting not only polar but also bi-polar variability. Figure
4(c) shows our observations for the MSY1 dataset. The
resulting histogram has peaks at both ends. This indicates
that the variations are bi-polar. To further verify our procedure on the MSY1 dataset, we removed Type 4 and 4a
from the 3' end and repeated the experiment. Figure 4(d)
shows biased histogram to the 5' end. That is, both
extremities of the MSY1 maps are highly variable, and the
unit types 4 and 4a already introduces another source of
variation, verifying the observation of Jobling et al. [5].
Duplication dynamics

We used WAMI to study duplication dynamics with the
MSY1 and MS205 datasets. Figure 5(left) shows the
resulting histogram for MSY1. The peak value on the
right shows En of the real dataset, where El = 876, and Er =
0. It is clear that this value is far from the En values of the
randomized datasets with expected equal rates of left-toright and right-to-left duplications. That is, the plot indicates that left and right duplications do not contribute
equally to the duplication history, and the units duplicate
preferably in the direction 3' T 5', as conjectured by
Jobling et al. [5]. In Figure 5 (right), we show the histogram for the MS205 dataset (haplotype C), which also
shows directional bias, but this time towards the right ( El
= 1940, and Er = 13318). These results for both datasets
may indicate the existence of unknown (chromosomespecific) dynamic constraints governing the duplication

Figure 5 Duplication dynamics histograms. Left: Histogram to detect directional bias for the MSY1 dataset. The distribution of En of the
randomized data is centered around zero. The peak at point 1 on the
x-axis is for En of the original dataset, and it is clearly far from that of data
with expected equal rates of left-to-right and right-to-left duplications.

Conclusions
In this paper, we presented WAMI, a web server for comprehensive analysis of minisatellites. The server provides
many of the functionalities needed by researchers in this
area. Future versions of the server are planned to provide
data-mining functionalities for associating the map comparison results to other features, like age, ethnicity, or
genetic markers on the chromosomes.
The algorithms of WAMI for minisatellite map analysis
can also be used for comparing arrays for tandemly
repeated units within proteins or gene sequences; the
work of Rivals et al. [29] shows an example of this application. The alignment part of WAMI can also be used to
compare parent/son microsatellite datasets, provided that
the microsatellite units are mapped to symbols, in analogy to the unit typing step of minisatellites. In addition to
its applications in parental tests, this comparison helps in
studying the mutation rates in association with other map
characteristics and helps in estimating parental ages. The
work of Dupuy et al. [30] is an example of such studies.
In this paper, we rely on a map evolution model based
on single- and double-copy duplications. In spite of the
computational difficulty, it is still interesting to incorporate the multiple copy duplication model in map alignment, eventually through heuristic algorithms.
Furthermore, it is also desirable to incorporate recently
suggested evolutionary operations, such as boundary
switch and modular structure change [31] appearing in
some minisatellite datasets. These operations could be
modeled by block exchange within the map, in an analogous way to the block exchange operation in genome
rearrangement studies. But a practical solution to this
problem is algorithmically challenging and remains a
subject of future research.
