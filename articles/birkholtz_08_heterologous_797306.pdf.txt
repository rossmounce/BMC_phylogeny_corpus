Abstract
Malaria remains the world's most devastating tropical infectious disease with as many as 40% of the
world population living in risk areas. The widespread resistance of Plasmodium parasites to the costeffective chloroquine and antifolates has forced the introduction of more costly drug combinations,
such as Coartem®. In the absence of a vaccine in the foreseeable future, one strategy to address
the growing malaria problem is to identify and characterize new and durable antimalarial drug
targets, the majority of which are parasite proteins. Biochemical and structure-activity analysis of
these proteins is ultimately essential in the characterization of such targets but requires large
amounts of functional protein. Even though heterologous protein production has now become a
relatively routine endeavour for most proteins of diverse origins, the functional expression of
soluble plasmodial proteins is highly problematic and slows the progress of antimalarial drug target
discovery. Here the status quo of heterologous production of plasmodial proteins is presented,
constraints are highlighted and alternative strategies and hosts for functional expression and
annotation of plasmodial proteins are reviewed.

Background
Malaria is a devastating disease and its long-term control
and eradication are still a long way off. There is no
licensed vaccine and our dispensary of affordable, effective drugs is in danger of being depleted in the short term

owing to increased drug resistance. The only solution currently is to resort to drug combinations coupled to insecticide spraying and/or the distribution of insecticidetreated bed nets. A number of novel drug targets have
been identified and/or validated, and are being pursued

for the development of new drugs. However, it is obvious
from the nearly 60% of hypothetical proteins in the parasite genome that have not yet been annotated, that relatively little of the biology of the parasite is known
compared to the biology of for example, humans, yeast or
plants [1]. The potential for the discovery of new and better drug targets is thus considerable. Bioinformatics tools
are useful in characterizing specific properties of selected
proteins and can even suggest possible functions of hypothetical proteins. However, protein function and structural properties can only be confidently inferred from
biochemical and cell biological experimentation, whilst
the design of inhibitors and evaluation of their interaction
with the protein of interest are ultimately dependent on
the availability of soluble and functional proteins. It is
widely accepted that a specific protein of interest can only
in rare instances be isolated in sufficient quantities from
the natural host cell for downstream studies. Heterologous expression of the selected protein is therefore of paramount importance. This review highlights the properties
that have been associated with difficult-to-express plasmodial proteins and provides insights into the variety of
options available for the heterologous expression of
malaria parasite proteins for structural and functional
annotation studies.
Escherichia coli as workhorse for plasmodial protein
expression
Escherichia coli is still the preferred host for the heterologous expression of recombinant proteins due to cost considerations, speed, ease of use and genetic manipulation.
However, for many proteins [2], including plasmodial
proteins, this approach is fraught with difficulties as
reflected by the paucity of plasmodial protein structures in
the Protein Data Bank (PDB, ~250), when compared to
the approximately 50,000 protein structures available in
the PDB. One of the major limitations of this system is the
expression of insoluble recombinant proteins sequestered
in inclusion bodies [3,4], as evidenced by the results from
several large scale protein expression endeavours [5-7].
The Structural Genomics of Pathogenic Protozoa group
(SGPP, University of Washington), selected 1,000 Plasmodium falciparum open reading frames for expression from
a modified pET vector in E. coli BL21 Star cells [5]. Of
these, expression was obtained for approximately one
third with only 63 proteins expressed in soluble form.
Another large scale attempt at expressing plasmodial proteins yielded only nine soluble, purified proteins out of 95
[6]. Lastly, the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC,
Toronto, Canada) selected 400 distinct P. falciparum target
genes representing different cellular classes, along with
orthologues from four other Plasmodium species as well as
Cryptosporidium parvum and Toxoplasma gondii [7]. From
the selected 1008 genes, 30% produced soluble proteins
from pET vectors and E. coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/7/1/197

cells of which ~100 crystallized, culminating in 36 crystal
structures. The most significant conclusion from this
study was that the percentage of pure protein, crystals and
structures could be doubled when orthologues from all six
genomes were included compared to those obtained from
P. falciparum alone.
The E. coli host expression system can be optimized to
ensure expression plasmid stability, the absence of harmful natural proteases and availability of the relevant
genetic elements, e.g. DE3 [8]. The most popular expression vector/E. coli strain combination seems to be based
on pET vectors and the BL21 (DE3) E. coli strain as evidenced by the experiences of structural genomics consortia with the expression and purification of more than 100
000 proteins from Eubacteria, Archea and Eukarya. These
include the recA negative strains (BLR strain) for the stabilization of plasmids containing repetitive sequences, lacY
mutants (Tuner series), which enable adjustable levels of
protein expression and the trzb/gor negative mutants (Origami) for improved cytoplasmic disulphide bond formation [8]. Gene expression is also controlled by the decay
rate of mRNA and host strains that are deficient in specific
RNases may enhance expression by protecting the mRNA
from degradation [8]. In addition, several counter strategies can be employed to overcome codon bias and to
assist disulphide bond formation, protein phosphorylation and protein refolding (reviewed in [9]). Furthermore,
fusion tags such as hexahistidine, Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and others (reviewed in [10]), often improve
solubility of the recombinant protein and their effect can
be predicted bioinformatically, which is useful to guide
the investigator in the selection of an appropriate vector.
New technologies include the Gateway System, which
uses the araBAD promoter designed for tight control of
background expression and L-arabinose-dependent
graded expression of the target protein. It also allows flexibility in terms of a rapid and highly efficient route to multiple expression and functional analysis options and has
been successfully applied for high-throughput recombinatorial cloning of P. falciparum functional molecules
(especially vaccine candidates) [6] and as a transfection
vector set [11].
Overexpression of proteins in E. coli frequently leads to
insoluble protein in inclusion bodies due to metabolic
stress and it is worthwhile to explore various expression
conditions such as lower incubation temperatures and
enriched media to promote expression of soluble recombinant proteins [9,12,13]. Interesting new advances,
which have thus far not been applied to plasmodial protein expression include the use of bacterial bioreactors utilizing a combination of the above-mentioned attributes,
as well as low temperature, and the induction of an
mRNA-specific endoribonuclease causing host cell growth

Malaria Journal 2008, 7:197

arrest and culture condensation. These bioreactors facilitate expression of heterologous proteins to ~30% of total
cellular protein in a stable, condensed fashion without
toxic effects due to the arrested state of the E. coli [14].
Recent experiments indicated that in response to expression of insoluble proteins, direct targets of the σ32 heat
shock sigma factor are highly expressed [15,16]. Manipulation of this functional response could provide a wideranging mechanism for improving recombinant protein
solubility. Thus the σ32-regulon would be induced before
the accumulation of insoluble proteins, producing a
larger pool of chaperones and a simultaneous increase in
protein folding [15].
Protein characteristics that jeopardized soluble expression
of recombinant plasmodial proteins were found to
include higher molecular weight (> 56 kDa), greater protein disorder, more basic pI (> 6) and lack of homology to
E. coli proteins. In addition, the presence of low complexity regions (SEG > 29%) and Plasmodium-specific inserts,
transmembrane regions, as well as signal peptides, transit
peptides and export motifs, have a negative impact on
protein expression [5-7]. The presence of conserved
sequences for prokaryotic promoters and ribosome binding sites within the plasmodial gene of interest, as well as
unusual mRNA and/or stable secondary structures should
also be avoided [17]. The difficulties of expressing plasmodial proteins in E. coli have also been attributed to toxicity of plasmodial proteins [7] and the difference in
amino acid content between proteins of the two species,
which imposes a metabolic burden on the bacterial host.
Ribosome stalling is triggered by the limited availability
of specific amino acids, which causes errors in and/or
truncated forms of the recombinant protein. The prevalence of codons rare in E. coli, especially Arg codons (AGA
and AGG), can also cause the ribosome to pause and bring
about the early termination of expression due to tRNA
exhaustion [18]. The marked A+T bias in the P. falciparum
genome [19,20] has also been implicated in low level
expression of proteins, although two large scale studies
revealed that A+T richness per se does not appear to affect
expression [5-7].
It is clear that the ability to predict soluble protein expression is limited, but bioinformatics analyses can guide the
design of strategies to deal with features associated with
difficult-to-express proteins in E. coli. Proteins of the apicomplexan species have unusually high contents of long,
disordered regions compared to other eukaryotes. In addition, the mammalian malaria parasites are particularly
enriched in intrinsically unstructured proteins when compared to those of the rodent species [21]. Intrinsically
unstructured and low complexity regions overlap with
each other to some extent but often coexist discretely in
the P. falciparum genome [22]. These regions, their
extraordinary lengths as well as the occurrence of bifunc-

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/7/1/197

tional plasmodial proteins expressed from one open-reading frame, impose significant constraints on the
probability of obtaining soluble expression of these proteins [19,20,23]. The intrinsically disordered regions in
proteins have distinct functions [24] and their complete
removal is not necessarily a viable option even if it occurs
at the N- or C-terminal ends of proteins [25] without prior
consideration to functional motifs that can be identified
by bioinformatics methods and retained in gene constructs [26]. Alternatively, systematic N- and C-terminal
deletions can be conducted to promote soluble expression
[27]. It is also worthwhile taking note of the application
of isolation methods specifically designed for isolation of
proteins with high structural disorder in soluble form
[28,29] and newer methods for co-expression of proteins
with interacting protein partners to improve soluble
expression of largely unstructured proteins [30-32].
Beyond the obvious removal of e.g. signal peptides and/or
minor genetic engineering of other interfering traits
[8,19,20,23] other options include searching for orthologous genes in other plasmodial species and apicomplexan
parasites with attributes more amenable to soluble expression (see e.g. [23]) or expression of single domains of
bifunctional or unstructured proteins [33-35].
Faced with the myriad of possibilities described above it is
gratifying to note that newer methods are available that
are especially applicable in academic laboratories for the
efficient parallel screening of multiple constructs with
minimal cost. These methods include novel expression
vectors, micro-expression in 96-well format, a colony filtration blot procedure and new shakers or fermentors
allowing for the simultaneous expression analyses of several different protein samples [13].
A survey was performed on the expression of potential
antimalarial drug targets from the WHO TDR Targets database [36]. From the 57 potential drug targets with druggability evidence indices above 0.7, 32 were chosen.
Hypothetical or putative proteins were excluded (Table
1). From these, no evidence for the expression of 19%
were obtained whereas all of the remaining proteins could
be expressed in E. coli, one in yeast and two proteins in
cell-free systems. His-tagging for isolation of the protein
had preference over other tags. Special conditions utilized
to express these plasmodial proteins include truncations,
codon optimization and tRNA additions. The following
sections introduce alternative strategies and expression
hosts worth exploiting.
Codon-optimization vs -harmonization of plasmodial
proteins
Codon bias refers to the high frequency preferential use of
a particular codon coding for an amino acid within an
organism. There is a high level of codon mismatch

The TDR Targets database (tdrtargets.org) were searched for P. falciparum genes with a druggability evidence index ≥0.7. Hypothetical or putative
proteins were excluded.

between P. falciparum and expression hosts, such as E. coli
and two different strategies have been used to minimize
codon bias. Firstly, the intracellular tRNA pool can be
expanded by using plasmids which encode rare tRNAs
used in certain organisms, for example E. coli [23]. Secondly, altering the codons of the target genes to suit the
codon preference of the non-natural expression host is a
process referred to as 'codon-optimization' [18,37-39].
This approach has met with some success, especially in
antimalarial vaccine targets [17,18,40,41], but unfortunately the expression of several other malaria proteins was
not improved through codon-optimization alone [42]. As
an example, SGPP [5] reported that nine out of the twelve
P. falciparum genes that had been synthesized with optimized codons could still not be expressed in E. coli, and
the three proteins that were expressed were in inclusion
bodies. This led them to conclude that codon usage did
not have a significant impact on protein expression.
During translation, ribosomes often encounter low frequency codons that may cause translational pausing. It is
the stalling at these essential pause sites that halts protein
expression and allows a predetermined interval which
permits correct folding of the protein [38,43]. The technique of codon-harmonization or translational attenuation refers to the process of recognizing the low usage
frequency codons within the natural host (P. falciparum)
and altering the code of the gene to be expressed to
codons recognized as low usage frequency codons by the
non-natural host [38,39]. These changes ensure the positional codon frequency of low/intermediate and high

usage codons to remain the same in the non-natural host,
which allows for the translational processes to match that
of the natural host. By allowing the translational machinery to move and pause at the correct sites, the folding of
the secondary and tertiary structures occur as in the natural host [39,43-45]. This approach has been remarkably
successful in the heterologous production of a liver-stage
antigen of P. falciparum (LSA-1) previously refractory to
recombinant expression even with codon-optimization as
well as co-expression with a rare frequency tRNA plasmid
[45].
Molecular chaperones to aid plasmodial protein
expression
One of the difficulties in heterologous expression of plasmodial proteins is incorrect folding of the proteins in the
non-natural host. Molecular chaperones of the heat shock
protein family (Hsp) ensure that proteins in a cell are
properly folded and functional (reviewed in [46,47]). Of
particular interest is the demonstration that the co-transformation of target genes and chaperones from the same
species cloned into different plasmids resulted in an
increased yield of soluble protein in E. coli [32,48].

Hsp70, a 70 kDa heat shock protein, is an important class
of molecular chaperones involved in protein folding by
ATP-controlled cycles of substrate binding and release. At
least six genes for Hsp70-type proteins have been identified in P. falciparum [49,50] and PfHsp70-1 has features to
justify its candidature as co-expression partner, including
successful overexpression in E. coli [51]. PfHsp70-1 was

Page 5 of 20

Malaria Journal 2008, 7:197

able to reverse the thermosensitivity of E. coli cells in an in
vivo assay, which suggests that it interacted with E. coli protein substrates, protecting them against heat stress
[50,52]. PfHsp70-1 is able to recognize typical Hsp70
peptide substrates [53], due to its ability to suppress protein aggregation in vitro [54]. A study of the interactome of
PfHsp70-1 showed that it potentially recognizes a wide
range of P. falciparum substrates, including apicoplast proteins [50,55,56] and mutating these residues on an apicoplast transit peptide led to the protein being mistargeted
[57].
Like other Hsp70 proteins, PfHsp70-1 needs an Hsp40 cochaperone partner to function as a refoldase, otherwise its
role during co-expression with a target protein in E. coli
would be a mere suppression of protein aggregation.
PfHsp70 and PfHsp40 have been identified in the parasitophorous vacuole and Maurer's clefts, implicating them
in erythrocyte quality control of parasitic proteins and
their possible export into the erythrocyte [49,58,59]. More
than forty Hsp40 proteins have been identified and the
PfHsp40 for PfHsp70 is predicted to be PF14_0359
[56,60]. It is therefore conceivable that molecular chaperones from P. falciparum could be harnessed as co-expression partners during the overproduction of target proteins
in E. coli to provide a specialized folding pathway.
Refolding of incorrectly folded, insoluble plasmodial
proteins
The immense drawback during high level protein expression in E. coli is the production of insoluble proteins in
inclusion bodies [4,61]. Due to the reversibility of protein
aggregation in bacteria, several strategies are employed to
isolate and refold inclusion bodies since they are a good
source of reasonably pure polypeptides, which could provide protein in the native conformation after refolding
[62]. Inclusion bodies almost exclusively contain the
over-expressed recombinant protein and very little host
protein, ribosomal components or DNA/RNA fragments
[63]. Protein refolding is a complicated procedure requiring several optimization steps [64]. Solubilization of
inclusion bodies results in soluble protein in its nonnative conformation, which needs to be refolded [64].
The inclusion of chaotropic reagents ensures the successful formation of the native structure [64,65] by allowing
intra-molecular interactions and/or preventing intermolecular
interactions.

Sirawaraporn et al showed that disaggregated and refolded
P. falciparum dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from inclusion bodies yielded active protein in sufficient amounts
for enzyme function determinations [34]. Optimal refolding of P. falciparum cysteine protease falcipain-1 resulted
in an enzymatically active monomeric form of this protein, which exhibited high immunogenic activity [66].

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/7/1/197

Refolding procedures were also used to obtain high levels
of P. falciparum cysteine protease falcipain-2, resulting in
the crystallization of this protein [67]. Immunologically
active P. falciparum 42 kDa MSP142 was obtained by
refolding of MSP142 as a fusion protein from inclusion
bodies [68]. Due to the undesirability of fusion tags in
clinical trials, refolding protocols were utilized to obtain
the first recombinant form of P. falciparum MSP142 without a 6× His affinity tag [69].
Extensive optimization is required to produce functional
refolded plasmodial proteins, but commercial kits are
now available, and refolding represents a valuable, underutilized tool to improve the yield of soluble recombinant
P. falciparum proteins.
Alternative systems for expression of plasmodial proteins
Yeasts
The commonly-used yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae
and Pichia pastoris have been exploited extensively for the
heterologous expression of plasmodial proteins, both for
preparative purposes and functional characterization. S.
cerevisiae is a popular choice as host owing to the ease with
which it can be manipulated genetically and to the
extraordinary amount of information accumulated about
its molecular biology and physiology [70]. The use of this
model organism varies from vaccine production [71] to
functional characterization, drug discovery and resistance
studies and elucidating parasite protein interaction networks ("interactomes") through high-throughput 2hybrid analyses (e.g. [55,72]).

Expression in S. cerevisiae is typically controlled by inducible promoters, e.g. ADH2 (a glucose-repressed alcohol
dehydrogenase promoter), while N-terminal fusion to a
pheromone results in efficient secretion of recombinant
protein from the yeast cells [73,74]. Coupled with carefully controlled growth in fermenters, impressive yields of
10 – 75 mg/L have been reported [75,76]. Secretion into
the culture medium represents a major advantage of the
yeast system over E. coli, as it circumvents formation of
inclusion body precipitates and simplifies subsequent
purification. Furthermore, trafficking through the yeast
secretory compartments facilitates appropriate disulphide
bond formation and protein folding, which is especially
important for malaria vaccine production [76-78]. However, the latter advantage may have a sting in its tail: disulphide bonding in individual proteins may be
heterogeneous, resulting in a population of structural
conformers, not all of which contain the conformationally correct epitopes [76]. In addition, the yeast secretory
pathway may result in spurious O- and N-linked glycosylation of the heterologous proteins [79]. The latter is
especially relevant for plasmodial proteins, since these are
rarely (if ever) glycosylated in their native state. The prob-

lem may be circumvented to some extent by altering the
coding sequence to remove potential N-glycosylation
motifs or inclusion of N-glycosylation inhibitors [80].
Limitations in yeast systems that can reduce the final yield
include the codon usage of the expressed gene, the gene
copy number, efficient transcription by using strong promoters leading to the depletion of precursors and energy,
translocation, processing and folding in the endoplasmic
reticulum and Golgi, as well as protein turnover by proteolysis [81]. Cells which produce high levels of proteins
can accumulate unfolded protein in the ER, which aggregates, overwhelms and eventually shuts down the secretory pathway [82]. The yeast proteins that assist in folding
and disulphide bond formation differ from their counterparts in higher eukaryotes, which may affect folding of
foreign proteins [83]. Saccharomyces cerevisiae moreover
recognizes distinct A+T containing codons as termination
signals which could lead to the truncation of encoded proteins especially of the P. falciparum genome. Due to this
codon incompatibility, synthetic genes incorporating a
yeast codon bias are often used [84].

terized in this fashion including integral membrane transporters [93-95]; phospholipid synthesis and modifying
enzymes [96-99]; cell cycle, transcriptional and translational regulators [100-103]; and possible drug targets e.g.
Vitamin B6 synthesis enzymes (PfPdx1 and PfPdx2,
[104]) and folate metabolism proteins, dihydrofolate
reductase-thymidylate synthase, (DHFR-TS) and dihydrofolate synthase-folylpolyglutamate synthase (DHFSFPGS, [105]). A highly informative series of experiments
focused on DHFR-TS demonstrated how yeast complementation may be used as a versatile alternative to preparing soluble purified protein for the characterization and
exploitation of parasite drug targets. The complementation system was employed to determine the effects of
DHFR mutations in parasite field isolates on sensitivity/
resistance to antifolate drugs [106,107], the contribution
of various DHFR mutations to antifolate resistance and
predict future resistance trends by using a PCR-based random mutagenesis approach [108], and to screen novel
antifolate compounds for activity against sensitive and
resistant alleles of DHFR [109,110].

Recombinant vaccine production in S. cerevisiae has
focused largely on the preparation of transmission-blocking vaccines [76]. The principal components of these
experimental vaccines that block transmission of malaria
parasites to Anopheles are the epidermal growth factor
(EGF)-like domains of Pfs25 (of P. falciparum) or Pvs25 (of
P. vivax), a glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored
surface protein of the mosquito-stage zygotes and ookinetes of the parasite [85-87]. Additional vaccine expression studies in S. cerevisiae have centred on the C-terminal
domain of the major GPI-anchored surface protein of
merozoites, merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP119)
[88,89]. Despite these promising efforts, S. cerevisiae has
largely been superseded by Pichia pastoris as the host cell
of choice for vaccine production (see discussion below).
Nonetheless, S. cerevisiae has remained relevant to malaria
research through its highly characterized biology and
amenability to genetic manipulation, which allows it to
be exploited for functional characterization through complementation experiments. In these studies, the ability of
the heterologously expressed plasmodial proteins to rectify or modify aberrant phenotypes of conditional yeast
deletion mutants is typically assessed. The studies are
aided by the fact that relevant yeast mutants may be
obtained from extensive repositories e.g. EUROSCARF
[90], the Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project [91] and
the ATCC [92]. Often, the plasmodial coding sequence is
modified to increase G+C content and improve yeast
codon compatibility, single-copy yeast episomal plasmids
are used to keep heterologous protein expression to physiologically relevant levels and expression is driven by constitutive (e.g. ADH1) or inducible (e.g. GAL1) promoters.
Several classes of plasmodial proteins have been charac-

Lastly, S. cerevisiae is widely used to determine protein
binding partners by yeast two-hybrid analysis which has
resulted in a characterization of the P. falciparum interactome and identification of a network of 2,846 interactions
between 1,312 plasmodial proteins which have minimal
similarity to interaction networks of other model organisms [55,72].
Some of the non-conventional yeasts, such as Kluyveromyces lactis and the methylotrophs Pichia pastoris and
Hansenula polymorpha (now known as Pichia angusta,
[111]) have also been developed as expression systems.
Pichia pastoris is now the most frequently used yeast species for heterologous protein expression in general. It
shares the underlying features and methodology of S. cerevisiae, with one notable exception: its biology is considerably less well characterized. Hence, it is used almost
exclusively for preparative expression as opposed to the
large number of functional studies that have been carried
out in S. cerevisiae. However, the same principles apply:
plasmodial sequences are altered to incorporate a yeast
codon bias; potential N-glycosylation sites in the plasmodial sequences are removed by mutation; expression is
driven by an inducible promoter (the methanol-inducible
alcohol oxidase promoter, AOX1); efficient secretion into
the culture medium is afforded by N-terminal fusion to
the S. cerevisiae prepro-α-factor leader peptide and C-terminal tags are incorporated to facilitate purification from
the medium. The redox environment and co-factors in the
yeast secretory pathway should enhance correct folding,
solubility and intra-molecular disulphide bonding of vaccine proteins that rely critically on conformational
epitopes to generate a protective immune response; the

Page 7 of 20

Malaria Journal 2008, 7:197

latter may be compromized by spurious and unpredictable O-glycosylation of the heterologous protein, as well as
the formation of disulphide bond conformers with
reduced protective immunogenicity [112,113]. It appears
that the use of Pichia pastoris may improve heterologous
protein yield, compared with S. cerevisiae, and levels of 30
mg/L to more than 1 g/L of purified protein have consistently been reported, especially when combined with
batch-fed fermentation [113-121]. In addition, the ratio
of desirable/undesirable conformers may be improved in
Pichia pastoris [113]. In one study, this was further
enhanced by co-expressing the heterologous protein with
P. falciparum or Pichia pastoris protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), which improved yield as well as reducing Oglycosylation [121]. Exoprotease truncation of heterologous proteins may also be encountered in Pichia pastoris,
but was circumvented in one case by alteration of the Nterminal sequence of a P. falciparum circumsporozoite
protein (CSP)-derived vaccine product prone to digestion
[122].
A number of plasmodial vaccine proteins have been successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris, notably merozoite
proteins required for erythrocyte invasion (AMA-1, EBA175, MSP-1, MSP-3), the sporozoite-stage antigen CSP,
and transmission-blocking mosquito-stage antigens
(Pfs25) [41,112-120,123-127]. A notable exception to the
vaccine preparation studies in which Pichia pastoris has
been used almost exclusively in malaria research is the
functional characterization of P. falciparum transporters
thought to be involved in quinoline drug resistance,
PfCRT (P. falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter)
and a P-glycoprotein homologue, Pgh-1 [128-131]. In
addition to optimizing the codon usage for yeast expression, the plasmodial sequences were altered to remove
poly(A) stretches, potential yeast-specific premature termination signals and predicted stem-loop structures. A 5'
Kozak sequence was added, as well as C-terminal fusions
to bacterial biotin acceptor domains to enable subsequent
detection and/or purification. Successful membranelocalized expression of the transporters was followed by
functional characterization of these proteins.
Baculovirus
The use of baculovirus-infected insect cells to express
recombinant proteins is well established [132]. A lytic
virus, Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus, is
most commonly used. The gene of interest is cloned into
a transfer vector, which is co-transfected with viral DNA
into Spodoptera frugiperda (usually Sf9 or Sf21) insect cells.
In a homologous recombination event, the foreign gene,
under the control of a strong viral promoter such as polh
or p10, is integrated into the viral genome and recombinant protein is produced in the infected cells. A C-terminal or N-terminal fusion tag is incorporated into the

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/7/1/197

protein to facilitate purification. The large size of the viral
genome makes it amenable to the insertion of large segments of foreign DNA. Numerous baculovirus systems,
including a variety of transfer vectors, are now commercially available and technological improvements have
simplified the production and isolation of recombinant
baculovirus.
This approach has been successfully applied to several P.
falciparum proteins. In one large study, 17 proteins that
were expressed as insoluble inclusion bodies in E. coli
were transferred to a baculovirus/Sf21 system, which
resulted in high levels of soluble protein in one case (11.7
mg/500 ml culture) and lower levels of six other proteins,
ranging from 0.6 to 7.2 mg/500 ml culture [5]. The low
yield can easily be overcome by scaling up the procedure.
The baculovirus system uses eukaryotic insect cells to
express recombinant proteins and thus the folding and
assembly of newly synthesized polypeptides may be similar to the natural process in Plasmodium. As a result, soluble recombinant baculovirus P. falciparum proteins are
likely to fold correctly to produce immunologically active
proteins that are recognized by conformation-specific
monoclonal antibodies. This feature is vital when assessing the immunogenic response of the host to a recombinant Plasmodium protein that is considered to be a
vaccine target and several studies on P. falciparum antigens
illustrate this aspect. Recombinant domains of merozoite
surface protein MSP-1 [133,134], CSP [135,136] and a
erythrocyte membrane protein PfEMP1 variant [137]
retained their native conformational epitopes and elicited
antibody responses. In contrast, recombinant PfMSP-1
expressed in yeast had a different conformation to the
native protein and was immunologically inactive [133].
Erythrocyte binding antigen (PfEBA-175) has also been
expressed in a baculovirus system in soluble form that was
functionally active [138,139]. Additional examples are
apical membrane antigen (PfAMA-1), which was successfully purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells [140]
and recombinant serine repeat antigen (PfSERA), which
was subsequently processed into several fragments that
reflect the in vivo situation in the parasite [141].
The genes coding for two P. falciparum aminopeptidases
were chemically synthesized using codons optimized for
the yeast Pichia pastoris, but expression in yeast was unsuccessful. In contrast, when these constructs were transfected into Sf9 insect cells, soluble recombinant proteins
that were enzymatically active were produced in sufficient
quantities to perform kinetic and biochemical analyses
[142,143]. A subtilisin-like protease (PfSUB-1), involved
in merozoite invasion, was expressed and secreted in a
baculovirus system and used in functional studies to
assess the interaction with its cognate propeptide [144]. A

micronemal protein present in Plasmodium berghei ookinetes (von Willebrand factor A domain-related protein,
PbWARP) was produced in a baculovirus system and
retained its function and oligomeric structure [145]. This
protein plays a role in the motility and attachment of the
ookinete in the mosquito midgut and homologues of this
protein exist in P. falciparum and P. vivax [145].
An important aspect of the baculovirus/insect cell system
is that it recognizes eukaryotic targeting signals, which
allows expression and processing of different classes of
proteins, including those that are secreted, localized to the
plasma membrane or nucleus, and cytoplasmic proteins
[135,146]. The host insect cell can also perform most
post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acylation and glycosylation. The high expression levels of recombinant proteins in the late stages of the viral
life cycle can however lead to incomplete post-translational processing, resulting in, for example, hypophosphorylation of some proteins. Glycosylation can also be
problematic [132], especially since N- and O-glycosylation only seem to occur at very low levels in P falciparum
[147]. Native PfEBA-175 is essentially unglycosylated,
despite the presence of putative sites, whereas 20% of the
recombinant baculovirus protein was N-glycosylated,
although this did not affect its immunogenicity [139]. The
major carbohydrate modification in Plasmodium is the
addition of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor
to the C-terminal amino acid of a protein [147]. GPIanchored proteins play an important role in numerous
cellular functions and are essential for parasite survival.
Baculovirus may not be ideal for expressing GPI-anchors
since recombinant CSP was devoid of the GPI moiety,
despite the presence of a potential GPI cleavage/attachment site in the DNA.
A modification of the baculovirus system is to use a virus
specific for silkworm larvae, as opposed to cultured insect
cells. The yield of biologically and immunologically active
PfMSP-142 recombinant protein from these larvae was >
100-fold higher than from Sf cells [148]. However, expertise in handling silkworm larvae is currently centred
mainly in China.
The baculovirus system is a valuable tool for the expression of Plasmodium proteins and represents a viable alternative to explore, especially since it is difficult to predict
which heterologous host will be optimal for a specific protein and also because a universally applicable method to
express recombinant malaria proteins is not available
(Figure 1). In addition, the system lends itself to automation and scaling up of protein production. However, it
requires a considerable investment in time and financial
resources and it is technically more demanding than
manipulating E. coli.

Dictyostelium discoideum
The single-celled amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum has
become an important and accessible model organism for
studying numerous aspects of eukaryotic cell biology,
such as cell division, locomotion, signal transduction and
vesicular trafficking, [149]. From the point of view of plasmodial expression, D. discoideum offers several attractive
features: 1) The relative ease with which it can be cultured
and manipulated genetically may be second only to yeast
amongst eukaryotic systems, hence its popularity as a
model organism [149]; 2) It contains the canonical
organelles and cell biological features of eukaryotic cells,
and could be used to infer the functional attributes of heterologously expressed plasmodial proteins by their interaction with endogenous proteins. It may be particularly
useful for integral membrane protein expression. For
example, expression and targeting of PfCRT to the digestive compartments of D. discoideum provided evidence for
the role of mutations in this membrane protein in reducing chloroquine (CQ) accumulation and hence mediating
CQ resistance in parasites [150]; 3) The relative ease with
which endogenous D. discoideum genes may be disrupted
by homologous recombination or silencing offers the
potential to create mutants for use in the functional characterization of heterologous proteins by complementation. For example, adenylate cyclase null mutants were
used to demonstrate the properties of PfACα, an integral
membrane protein possibly involved in gametocytogenesis [151]; 4) Plasma membrane anchoring via endogenous signal sequences and GPI-anchoring motifs could
be used to study the adhesion properties of malaria proteins, e.g. CSP [152]. Additionally, such recombinant D.
discoideum strains may be explored as potential live, nontoxic, non-pathogenic "sporozoite-mimicking" vaccines
[152]; 5) Dictyostelium discoideum originally became an
attractive vehicle for heterologous plasmodial protein
expression due to the unusual A+T bias of its gene coding
sequences: a feature it shares with P. falciparum [153]. The
organism was first used for the preparative expression of
malaria vaccine candidates including P. falciparum CSP
and, subsequently, the C-terminal portions of CSP from P.
yoelii and P. falciparum and a fragment of MSP1 of P. vivax
[152,154,155]. Although codon optimization was not
performed, it was noted that expression was considerably
improved by the N-terminal addition of D. discoideum
leader sequences or fusion partners. Unfortunately, the
paucity of reports on the use of D. discoideum for the preparative expression of plasmodial proteins prohibits an
assessment of the advantages conferred by the organism's
A+T bias and its utility in this regard over the more conventional yeast expression systems. Nonetheless, it is possible that D. discoideum is underexplored as an alternative
to mammalian cells and Xenopus oocytes for the functional expression of plasmodial membrane proteins and
transporters (see discussions below).

Generalized strategy for the successful expression of plasmodial proteins
Figure 1
Generalized strategy for the successful expression of plasmodial proteins. Extensive sequence analysis of a gene
could facilitate genetic manipulation of the gene if needed. E. coli should remain the starting point for the expression of soluble
proteins due to its ease of use and Xenopus remains the preferred choice for membrane protein expression. Several optimizations including codon adaptation, plasmodial chaperone co-expression and small sequence changes might be particularly necessary for the expression of the plasmodial protein of interest. Various other expression hosts including mammalian, baculovirus,
yeasts, Toxoplasma, Dictyostelium and cell free systems have been used with various levels of success and might include an iterative process incorporating necessary optimizations.

Toxoplasma gondii
Toxoplasma gondii is an important parasite pathogen in
immuno-compromized individuals and during pregnancy. Like malaria parasites, it belongs to the phylum
Apicomplexa, with the advantage that it is considerably
more susceptible to experimental manipulation by standard molecular genetic approaches [156]. Phylogenetic
relatedness notwithstanding, the differences in host cell
niche, pathogenesis and life-cycles (in addition to a G+C
vs. A+T codon bias) makes it debatable to what extent the
cell biology and metabolic pathways of T. gondii are
related to those of the various life-cycle stages of malaria
parasites. Nonetheless, Toxoplasma and Plasmodium share
the same mechanism of locomotion as well as the specialized secretory organelles and mechanisms required for
host cell invasion [157]. Consequently, T. gondii may be a
useful host for the heterologous expression and characterization of malaria proteins involved in locomotion, invasion and biogenesis of the specialized secretory organelles
(rhoptries, micronemes and dense granules). Per illustration, expression of a dominant negative mutant form of
PfVps4 led to the identification of a multi-vesicular body
endosomal compartment involved in rhoptry biogenesis
in Toxoplasma and suggested the existence of similar
organelles and their functions in malaria parasites [158].
A further potential use of T. gondii expressing plasmodial
sequences is as an attenuated live vaccine. Experiments in
Rhesus monkeys and mice have demonstrated the promising utility of T. gondii strains expressing P. knowlesi and

P. yoelii CSP in this regard [159,160]. From a preparative
point of view, the P. falciparum cGMP-dependent protein
kinase (PfPKG) was expressed and purified from T. gondii
to characterize its enzymatic properties and susceptibility
to inhibitors [161]. Nonetheless, it is unlikely that T. gondii will challenge E. coli or yeast systems as a first choice
for this type of application.
Mammalian cells
To a significant extent, mammalian cells share with S. cerevisiae the features of being well characterized, having versatile reagents and protocols for transgene expression and
analysis as well as potentially aiding correct folding of heterologous proteins in secretory compartments and
imparting post-translational modifications (e.g. lipid
modifications, GPI-anchoring, etc.). However, the substantially lower yields of recombinant proteins minimize
their use for preparative expression. An advantage of
mammalian cells is the ability to target heterologous
membrane proteins to subcellular compartments and the
cell surface. As a result, the large majority of studies
reporting the expression of plasmodial proteins in mammalian cells have focused on the identification and characterization of parasite surface ligands that mediate host
cell binding. These experiments have significantly contributed to our understanding of erythrocyte invasion by
helping to identify merozoite proteins and their domains
that mediate erythrocyte binding, notably EBA-175, AMA1, Duffy-binding protein, JESEBL, MAEBL, MSA-1 and

Malaria Journal 2008, 7:197

PfAARP (e.g [162-170]). In addition, the studies have
characterized regions of PfEMP-1 involved in binding to
host chondroitin sulphate A (CSA), ICAM-1, CD36 and
uninfected erythrocytes, thus mediating parasite sequestration to the placenta and vascular endothelium as well
as erythrocyte rosetting in infected individuals [171-174].
A concomitant advantage of surface expression has been
to map out conserved epitopes recognized by inhibitory
monoclonal antibodies and human sera (e.g. [175-177]).
To facilitate the surface binding experiments, parasite protein domains are modified by N- and C-terminal fusion to
mammalian or viral secretory signal sequences and transmembrane domains/GPI-anchoring motifs, respectively,
and tagged with an epitope tag and/or GFP to monitor
expression. The COS-7 green monkey kidney cell-line has
generally been used for these (and other plasmodial
expression) experiments, but the well-known CHO-K1
and HeLa cell lines have also been employed. Interestingly, with few exceptions (e.g. [174,177]), the plasmodial sequences were rarely altered to rectify A+T-codon
bias and remove potential N-glycosylation sites.
The second most numerous application of mammalian
cell expression in malaria research is to support the development of DNA plasmid-based vaccines. Transfection of
mammalian cells with the vaccine plasmids is used to verify expression of the relevant plasmodial sequences prior
to proceeding with animal vaccination. In addition, mammalian cell expression may also be used to assess the generation of the desired specific antibodies subsequent to
vaccination (e.g. [178-181]). Again, codon optimization
is rarely reported. This raises the possibility that mammalian cells may be more accommodating for the expression
of the A+T-biased plasmodial sequences.
Despite the advantages offered by the extensive characterization of mammalian cell biology, the cells appear to be
rarely used for functional characterization of plasmodial
proteins, beyond the ligand binding studies described
above. One likely reason is the comprehensive difficulty
of preparing functionally compromized mutants, which
hampers the complementation studies that have been
extensively done in S. cerevisiae (and potentially D. discoideum). A prospective (unreported) alternative may be to
use post-transcriptional silencing (e.g. RNAi-mediated) to
generate deficient cells for complementation assays. In
addition, provided the functional readout is sufficiently
sensitive and robust, overexpression of plasmodial proteins above the endogenous background may yield useful
results. A further advantage for functional characterization is the high transient transfection efficiencies that can
be achieved with current transfection reagents and cell
types (e.g. COS cells), which may increase the turnaround
time from transfection to analysis. Examples have
included the cytoplasmic expression of CDP-diacylglyc-

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/7/1/197

erol synthase (PfCDS), mannosyl transferase (PfPIG-M),
PfVPS4 and histidine rich protein II HRPII, which has
shed light on the potential roles of these parasite proteins
in phospholipid synthesis, GPI-anchor synthesis, endocytic trafficking and pH-sensing, respectively [158,182184].
Both Plasmodium membrane transporters implicated in
CQ resistance, Pgh1 and PfCRT, have been functionally
expressed in mammalian cells. Although the intracellular
location of Pgh1 expressed in CHO cells could not be
determined accurately, it increased CQ uptake and sensitivity in these cells, whilst Pgh1 incorporating CQ resistance-associated mutations did not [185]. After
synthetically introducing a yeast codon bias into the
PfCRT cDNA sequence, the protein was expressed in HEK
293 cells and faithfully targeted to lysosomal membranes
[186]. Surprisingly, in contrast to the results obtained in
D. discoideum ([150]; see earlier discussion), PfCRT did
not alter CQ accumulation in the host cells but increased
acidification of lysosomes, an effect which was enhanced
when the CQ resistance-conferring mutation K76T was
included in the protein. The latter contradiction highlights the possibility that conclusions drawn from characterization in heterologous cell types may not always
translate to accurate functional prediction in the parasite
and does not substitute for characterization in the parasite
itself.
Xenopus laevis
Once the technical and logistical challenges of Xenopus
oocyte micro-manipulation and cRNA injection have
been overcome, the cells may be extremely useful for the
functional expression and characterization of membrane
proteins, notably transport proteins. It has become the
method of choice for characterizing Plasmodium transporters, particularly since the oocytes appear to be more tolerant than other eukaryotic cells to the peculiar codon
preferences of Plasmodium genes [187,188]. The expression system has been used most extensively to characterize PfHT1, the principal hexose transporter of P.
falciparum [188], in order to define its substrate specificity,
probe structure-function relationships by mutational
analysis with a view to therapeutic inhibitor design and
confirm it as a potential drug target [189-191]. The substrate specificity of PfENT1, one of the four equilibrative
nucleoside transporters encoded by the P. falciparum
genome, was also determined using Xenopus oocyte
expression and compared favourably with results
obtained from transport experiments using isolated parasites, thus validating the oocyte system as a more convenient surrogate for studying this transporter [192-195]. A
similar comparison of properties between isolated parasites and heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes was
obtained for Na+- and membrane potential-dependent

Malaria Journal 2008, 7:197

transport of inorganic monovalent phosphate by PfPiT
[196]. Additional transporters characterized by expression
in Xenopus oocytes coupled with oocyte swelling assays
include the aquaglyceroporins of P. falciparum and P.
berghei (PfAQP and PbAQP) [197,198].
A significant contribution of the Xenopus oocyte expression system to malaria drug discovery was the identification and characterization of the foremost target of the
artemisinins, PfATP6, a SERCA-type Ca2+ ATPase [199].
The study followed on the characterization of PfATP4, a P.
falciparum P-type membrane Ca2+-ATPase, vis-à-vis its susceptibility to inhibitors and Ca2+ concentration-dependent activation [200]. Of further relevance to drug
discovery was the use of Xenopus oocyte expression to
investigate the role of PfCRT in conferring CQ resistance.
The findings led the authors to propose that PfCRT affects
CQ susceptibility in parasites by a modulation of food
vacuole transporters, rather than by directly affecting vacuole pH or transporting CQ [201].
It should be noted that, although the Xenopus oocyte
expression system has been used almost exclusively to
characterize malaria membrane transporters, it is a functional cell and can be a useful system for studying other
cellular functions as well, for example, cell signalling.
After expression in oocytes, the parasite leucine-rich
repeat antigen (PfLRR1) was found to bind to the endogenous Xenopus protein phosphatase PP1 and disrupt the
oocyte G2/M cell cycle arrest, observed as germinal vesicle
breakdown. By inference, PfLRR1 probably regulates protein phosphatase activity and cell cycle progression in
malaria parasites [202]. In addition, measurement of
cAMP levels in oocytes was used to characterize the properties of a X. laevis codon-optimized version of the parasite adenylyl cyclase (PfACα) and confirm results
obtained by complementation assays in Dictyostelium
[151].
Plants
The use of plants as expression hosts for foreign proteins
has received increasing attention. Several heterologous
proteins have been expressed in plants due to their ability
to successfully express, fold and post-translationally modify foreign proteins. The real potential lies in the possibility of transgenic plants as bioreactors for the production
of vaccines since the feasibility and low cost have been
validated in several human and animal disease vaccines. It
is therefore attractive to speculate that plants may be a
host for 1) the transient production of functional plasmodial proteins or 2) the transgenic production of e.g.
malaria vaccine targets. The latter has been under investigation with reports by Ghosh et al. (2002) in which they
successfully obtained constitutive expression of a 19 kDa
proteolytic product of P. falciparum MSP1 in tobacco

http://www.malariajournal.com/content/7/1/197

plants resulting in the same immunogenic properties as
an E. coli expressed form of the protein [203]. More
recently, the concept of edible vaccines derived from antigen production in plants was supported by evidence from
Hepatitis-B trials in humans and mice and has now been
extended to the P. yoelii MSP4/5 expressed in transgenic
tobacco [204]. This protein was codon optimized for production in plants and resulted in the high level expression
of the antigen that could elicit protective antibodies in
mice fed orally. These reports therefore indicate the feasibility of exploiting plants for the production of malaria
proteins.
Cell-free protein expression
Cell-free transcription-translation systems have been
exploited with varying degrees of success for numerous
proteins including membrane proteins and cytotoxic proteins (reviewed in [205,206]). Advantages include production of proteins that undergo proteolysis or that
usually accumulate in inclusion bodies, as well as allowing selective labelling. Of recent interest is the wheat germ
cell-free platform [206], which allows the high-level
expression of eukaryotic proteins that can not be
expressed in E. coli cells/cell-free systems. Optimized
wheat germ systems have been created by removal of
ribosomal protein synthesis inhibitors (tritin) from the
wheat embryo to allow the robust production of proteins.
This technology has been adopted by structural genomics
consortia (e.g. Centre for Eukaryotic Structural Genomics,
Madison, WI). The difficulties experienced over many
years in obtaining significant soluble expression of PfDHFR-TS are well-documented [207]. In a recent study it
was shown that a wheat germ cell-free expression system
yielded bioactive protein as an obligate dimer without the
associated toxicity observed in cell-based systems [207].
Moreover, several malaria vaccine targets (Pfs25, PfCSP
and PfAMA-1) were successfully expressed in both native
and codon-optimized forms which did not seem to influence the efficiency of expression, at least of Pfs25 [208].
Yields between 50 and 200 μg/ml of soluble protein were
obtained which was subsequently shown to be immunogenically active in raising specific antibodies in mice.
Ambitiously, this study was expanded to include 124
additional P. falciparum blood stage proteins that were
expressed in their native forms. Of these, 75% of the proteins were produced with an average yield of 1.9 μg/150
μl reaction mixture and 65% solubility. Inverse correlations were observed between soluble protein production
and protein size, frequency of low-complexity regions and
pI of the proteins.

Conclusion and future perspectives
Heterologous expression of plasmodial proteins as
described above is principally carried out for preparative

ies, preparation of recombinant vaccines, drug screening,
antigen preparation, enzymatic and other in vitro functional assays, etc. However, in light of our poor understanding of parasite cell biology and the fact that the
majority of malaria proteins predicted by the genome
have unknown or uncertain functions, an important concomitant activity is the elucidation of Plasmodium in vivo
protein function by heterologous expression in experimentally tractable, well-characterized eukaryotic model
organisms and cell types. Model eukaryotes are especially
favoured for the expression and characterization of integral membrane proteins, for which prokaryotes are generally ill-suited, provided that spurious, incorrect posttranslational modifications (notably glycosylation) in the
secretory pathway of the host cell can be avoided or tolerated. In addition to in situ functional characterization of
malaria proteins, eukaryotic cells have also been explored
for preparative expression in an attempt to circumvent
problems experienced in prokaryotes, notably incorrect
protein folding, insolubility and codon incompatibility,
as described in the preceding sections.
From the above, it is evident that each protein has to be
assessed on an individual basis since there is no universal
procedure for the heterologous expression of malaria proteins or proteins of other organisms. However, a protocol
is suggested worthy of consideration when attempting to
express a plasmodial protein (Figure 1). Bioinformatics
analyses of the gene and its encoded protein is clearly of
paramount importance to guide the selection of the
appropriate gene construct, the host/vector combination
and the expression and isolation procedures. Expression
of proteins from E. coli systems is clearly the first choice
due to its ease of genetic manipulation and the availability
of a variety of different vectors and E. coli strains. Fortuitously, new strains, vectors and methods are continuously
being developed to address the multitude of challenging
impediments revealed by structural genomics consortia in
their endeavours to determine the three-dimensional
structures of proteins encoded by the genomes of Eubacteria, Archea and Eukarya.
Alternative hosts including yeasts, baculovirus and cellfree systems, with or without codon adaptation strategies,
are additional options to be explored if expression from E.
coli systems is problematic. For preparative expression of
soluble proteins, Pichia pastoris, baculovirus and cell free
systems may be the most successful whereas alternatives
such as Saccharomyces, Dictyostelium and mammalian systems may be more beneficial for functional analyses with
the first two additionally having the major advantage of
complementation studies thereby circumventing soluble
protein isolation. Attempts to express transmembrane
proteins for functional analyses should be focussed on
systems including Xenopus and mammalian systems with
a potential application of Dictyostelium as host.

The introduction and ongoing development of reverse
genetics methodology for P. falciparum [e.g[209]], coupled with sporadic reports of successful post-transcriptional silencing by antisense RNA, RNAi and ribozymes
[e.g. [210,211]], provides the primary tools for elucidating protein function in the parasite. Nonetheless, transgene expression in more tractable heterologous model
organisms (notably through mutant complementation in
yeast and surface expression in Xenopus oocytes and mammalian cells) offers a powerful parallel approach to aid
functional characterization. These transgene expression
strategies are especially useful for determining substrate or
ligand specificity, structure-function relationships
through mutational analysis, and inhibitor sensitivity/
resistance, and, under optimal circumstances, may even
replace the requirement for preparative expression of purified soluble protein.
It is clear that numerous options are available, and will
continue to be developed, for the successful expression of
plasmodial proteins. This facet of research, however, still
represents a major challenge to scientists in the malaria
field, but it is a vital first step in the post-genomic functional and structural characterization of these proteins.
This knowledge is crucial to identify new proteins that
may serve as potential drug or vaccine targets, which will
enhance our chances of producing new therapies to combat malaria in the future.
