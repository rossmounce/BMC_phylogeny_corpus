Abstract
Background: Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are a set of chromatin-modifying proteins that play
a key role in epigenetic gene regulation. The PcG proteins form large multiprotein complexes with
different activities. The two best-characterized PcG complexes are the PcG repressive complex 1
(PRC1) and 2 (PRC2) that respectively possess histone 2A lysine 119 E3 ubiquitin ligase and histone
3 lysine 27 methyltransferase activities. While PRC2-like complexes are conserved throughout the
eukaryotic kingdoms, PRC1-like complexes have only been described in Drosophila and
vertebrates. Since both complexes are required for the gene silencing mechanism in Drosophila
and vertebrates, how PRC1 function is realized in organisms that apparently lack PRC1 such as
plants, is so far unknown. In vertebrates, PRC1 includes three proteins, Ring1B, Ring1A, and Bmi1 that form an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. These PRC1 proteins have an N-terminally located Ring
finger domain associated to a poorly characterized conserved C-terminal region.
Results: We obtained statistically significant evidences of sequence similarity between the Cterminal region of the PRC1 Ring finger proteins and the ubiquitin (Ubq)-like family proteins, thus
defining a new Ubq-like domain, the RAWUL domain. In addition, our analysis revealed the
existence of plant and worm proteins that display the conserved combination of a Ring finger
domain at the N-terminus and a RAWUL domain at the C-terminus.
Conclusion: Analysis of the conserved domain architecture among PRC1 Ring finger proteins
revealed the existence of long sought PRC1 protein orthologs in these organisms, suggesting the
functional conservation of PRC1 throughout higher eukaryotes.

Background
Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are epigenetic gene regulators implicated in important cellular and developmental processes. In animals, PcG proteins were primarily
known for their role in maintaining cell identity during

the establishment of the body plan [1], but recently they
have also been implicated in other important processes
like stem cell self-renewal and cancer [2,3]. In plants, the
PcG proteins are involved in the repression of flowering
during vegetative development [4,5], seed development

[6], and in the vernalization response [7]. Hence, PcG proteins play an essential role in the proper development of
multicellular organisms.
Biochemical and genetic characterizations of PcG proteins
have revealed that they exist in distinct multi-protein
complexes [8,9], of which the two best characterized are
the PcG repressive complex (PRC)1 and PRC2. The core
components of PRC2 are conserved throughout higher
eukaryotes. The complex mediates histone H3 methylation at lysine 27 [10-12]. Similar complexes have been
found in Caenorhabditis elegans [13,14], vertebrates [1012,15,16] and plants [4,5].
Unlike PRC2, PRC1-like complexes have only been
described in Drosophila and vertebrates. Drosophila
PRC1 core complex contains Posterior sex combs (Psc),
Polyhomeotic (Ph), Drosophila Ring finger protein 1 or
Sex combs extra (dRing1/Sce) and Polycomb (Pc) [17,18].
The complex can inhibit in vitro both chromatin remodeling by the human SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable
(hSWI/SNF) complex [19,20] and transcription of a chromatin template by RNA polymerase II [21]. The human
PRC1 complex is composed of B lymphoma Mo-MLV
insertion region 1 homolog (Bmi-1), PH2, PC3, and the
Ring finger proteins (Ring1A/RING1 and Ring1B/
RING2), homologs of Drosophila Psc, Ph, Pc, and dRing,
respectively. Human Bmi1, Ring1A and Ring1B proteins
form an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that mono-ubiquitinates lysine 119 of nucleosomal histone H2A (H2AK119) [22,23]. The H2A-K119 monoubiquitination is
required for the PcG-mediated in vivo gene silencing, but
its role in the mechanism is not yet known [23]. Drosophila PRC1 presumably possesses ubiquitin E3 ligase
activity as well, since dRing was found to co-localize with
ubiquitinated H2A at the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) promoter
[22].
In Drosophila and vertebrates the PcG-mediated gene
silencing mechanism requires the action of both PRC2
and PRC1. The apparent lack of homologs of PRC1 components in organisms such as plants or worms and the
conflicting information on histone ubiquitination in
these organisms led to the speculation of alternative PcGmediated gene silencing mechanism in which other proteins undertake PRC1 functions [4,24-29]. Ubiquitination
at lysine 119 of H2A in human was observed within the
consensus peptide sequence PKKT [22]. Arabidopsis
genome contains 13 histone H2A genes (HTA1-13) [30],
among them just HTA10 displays conservation of the
PKKT consensus sequence. Although H2A ubiquitination
has not been detected in Arabidopsis using western blot
analysis so far [31], a recent report showed the presence of
ubiquitinated H2A in maize [32]. On the other hand,
ubiquitinated H2A has been detected in C. elegans [29],

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/308

indicating that some proteins may be involved in H2A
ubiquitination.
The catalytic subunit of the mammalian E3 ubiquitin
ligase complex is Ring1B, but Ring1A and Bmi-1 are also
required for the in vivo H2A ubiquitination [31]. Bmi-1,
Ring1B and Ring1A contain a Ring finger domain located
at the N-terminal region. Biochemical analyses showed
that the N-terminal Ring finger domain of Ring1B is sufficient for the E3 ligase activity in vitro [22,33,34] and that
Bmi-1 displays no detectable ubiquitin ligase activity but
it greatly stimulates the E3-ligase activity of Ring1B. It was
also described that in vitro Ring1A can replace Ring1B
[34]; however, the in vivo function must be distinct, as
most of the ubiquitinated H2A is depleted upon lost of
Ring1B [31,35]. Structural analysis revealed that Ring1B
interacts with Bmi-1 via their Ring fingers [33,34].
The PRC1 Ring finger proteins also share a conserved Cterminal region [36,37] that seems to be implicated in the
interaction with Ph and Pc [38-40]. To gain mechanistic
insight into the assembly and the enzymatic activity of the
PRC1 proteins we performed a detailed computational
sequence analysis of the C-terminal region of these proteins. Our findings result in the identification of a new
ubiquitin-like domain that unveiled PRC1 Ring fingerlike proteins in plants and worm.

Results and discussion
Detection of a new ubiquitin-like domain in the PRC1 Ring
finger proteins
To analyse the conserved C-terminal region of the Ring
finger PRC1 proteins, we first performed BLAST searches
[41] against different sequence databases located at UniProt [42], NBCI [43], ENSEMBL [44] and JGI [45], starting
from the human Bmi-1. Alignments were generated with
T-Coffee [46] and checked manually. Additional profilebased sequence searches were performed against the
Uniref50 and Uniref 90 protein sequence databases [47]
with the defined global hidden Markov models using
HMMer [48]. Using extensive profile to sequence
(HMMer) and profile to profile comparisons analyses
[49] we identified statistically significant E-values of
sequence similarity between the C-terminal conserved
regions of PRC1 Ring finger proteins and the C-terminal
region of the WDR48-p80 protein family (Figure 1 and 2).
The WD repeat domain 48 or p80 (WDR48-p80) family
are WD40 repeat-containing endosomal proteins found
in all eukaryotes including yeast and are present in only
one copy per organism (Figure 1 and 3). Except for the
previously described interaction between the human
WDR48-p80 protein and a tyrosine kinase interacting protein from Herpesvirus saimiri virus (Tip), the exact function
of the WDR48-p80 family remains unknown but has been

suggested to be related to endosome/lysosome traffic [5052].
The statistical significance of profile to profile comparisons was evaluated in terms of an E-value. Significant Evalues connected all these sequences and reciprocal
searches produced convergent results (Figure 2). The
Bmi1/Mel18 subfamily profile search finds the Ring1A/1B

subfamily with a 3.2e-11 E-value and the global profile of
the PRC1 Ring family (including both Bmi1/Mel18 and
Ring1A/1B subfamilies) detected the WDR48-p80 and the
Ubl families with E-values of 3.7e-10 and 4.7e-07, respectively. The RAWUL HMM profile of the WDR48 family
have less capability to detect remote protein homologies
and localize the ubiquitin family with poor statistical significance (with an E value of 0.21), although RAWUL

the Ubq-like domain of the human Bmi-1 protein (Uniprot-id: BMI1_HUMAN, residues 131 to 226) to an independent fold assignment software (mGenThreader [56]).
mGenthreader consistently recognised only Ubq-like proteins as possible templates (8 out of the 10 proposed hits
are Ubq-like folds). This consistency in the threading output additionally supports the relationship between Ubq
and the conserved PRC1 Ring C-terminal domain. Third,
we generated a structural model (see Additional file 1) of
the human Bmi-1 putative Ubq-like domain based on
alignments including ubiquitin superfamily sequences of
known structure (Figure 1). The model was evaluated
using statistical mean force potential and found to have a
Z-score of -6.5, in the upper range of good model for this
length [57], strengthening the assignment of the Ubq fold.

domain is more conserved inside the WDR48 family than
in PRC1 Ring family. Nevertheless, the homology of the
WDR48 RAWUL domain with the UBL family is statistically supported, when using as intermediate the RAWUL
HMM profile of PRC1 Ring family.
This result defines a new conserved domain present in the
PRC1 Ring finger and WDR48 families. In all of those proteins the domain is always observed in a C-terminal location (Figure 3), suggesting that this is somehow important
for its function.
Statistically significant sequence similarity offered by profile-profile comparisons linked this domain with ubiquitin superfamily (Figure 1 and 2). Ubiquitin (Ubq) is a
highly conserved 76 amino acid residue protein found in
all eukaryotic cells and whose sequence is extremely well
conserved from protozoa to vertebrates [53]. The overall
topology of the Ubq-like fold is β1, β2, α1, β3, β4, α2, β5
(where β indicates beta strand and α alpha helix); however, there may be deviations from this common core
[54].
Although those E-values are significant per se, we performed three additional analyses. First, secondary structure predictions were performed independently for the
conserved C-terminal regions of PRC1 Ring finger and
WDR48-p80 families [55] (Figure 1). These predictions
showed good agreement with the Ubq and Ubq-like structures (Figure 1). Second, to investigate whether fold recognition analysis generated consistent results, we submitted

Despite the low sequence identity between this domain
and the Ubq (below 20%), the hydrophobic core and key
secondary structural elements of the Ubq fold are conserved (Figure 1) [54]. However, the PRC1 Ring finger
family displays a higher degree of sequence variability in
the C-terminal Ubq-like domain than the WDR48-p80
family. The domain secondary structural elements are rich
in charged residues and are separated by loops of variable
length (Figure 1 and Additional file 2), which are likely to
be the reasons why this domain escaped detection until
now. The fact that the domain shows insertions of variable length is not in contradiction with a stable fold [58];
even more, small folds, such as Ubiquitin [54], Immunoglobulin [59] or SBDS [60], share a high degree of
structural conservation in a scenario of high sequence
divergence and long loop insertions.
The most characteristic features of this domain is the α2
that is a bit larger in its C-terminus compared to classical
Ubq-like proteins and contains a conserved pair of Thr/
Leu that might have a structural role in capping the alpha
helix (Figure 1). Preliminary structural characterization of
the C-terminal region of Ring1B showed that this domain
folds independently and is a combination of alpha-helix
and beta-sheet secondary structures [61], which is in
agreement with our analysis.
In summary, considering the profile-profile comparisons
E-values (Figure 2), secondary structure predictions (Figure 1), fold assignment detection and the results of the
homology model building and evaluation (see Additional
file 1), we are confident that this domain is a new member
of the Ubq superfamily. Since we found this new Ubq-like
domain associated to two different domain architectures,
Ring-finger domain (in PRC1 Ring family) and WD40
repeats (in WDR48-p80 family), we named it RAWUL
(Ring-finger And WD40 associated Ubiquitin-Like)
domain.

(0.1). The main bootstrap values for PRC1 Ring family classification are indicated. Schematics of domain architecture are represented with the localization of the RAWUL, Ring domains and WD40 repeats according to this analysis, Pfam [91] and REP
web servers [92], respectively.

The ubiquitin related proteins fall into two separate
classes [62]. Ubq-like proteins (UBLs; eg, SUMO, NEDD8,
etc.) that function as modifiers in a manner analogous to
that of ubiquitin and exist either in a free form or attached
covalently to other proteins by their C-termini, and the
ubiquitin-domain proteins (UDPs) that bear domains
related to ubiquitin but are otherwise unrelated in
sequence to each other (i.e. parkin, Rad23, DSK2). In con-

trast to the UBL modifiers, the UDPs are not conjugated to
other proteins.
RAWUL domain lacks the characteristic C-terminal diglycine motif required for enzymatic conjugation of the Ubq
domain to an acceptor lysine. Neither are conserved the
three most common acceptor lysine residues involved in
polyubiquitination (Figure 1, represented in ubiquitin

(PDB:1aar) as K29, K48, and K63). Hence, it appears
unlikely that this domain functions as a traditional UBL
modifier. PRC1 Ring finger and WDR48-p80 proteins
therefore could be included in the group of UDPs. There
are two classes of UDPs as well [63] differentiated by their
location and sequence similarity to ubiquitin of their
Ubq-like domains.
The Ubq-like domain (UBD) proteins have the Ubq-like
domain located at or close to the N-terminus of the protein and defined by a stretch of 45–80 residues with significant sequence homology to ubiquitin, while the
Ubiquitin regulatory X (UBX) domain proteins have the
Ubq-like domain at the C-terminus consisting of ~80
amino acids that shares common secondary structure
organization with ubiquitin despite the lack of significant
sequence homology [64,65]. The UBD proteins have been
shown to bind to ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs),
like parkin protein. Defective parkin protein is responsible for a common familial form of Parkinson's disease.
Parkin encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase that contains two
Ring finger domains at its C-terminus and one Ubq-like
domain at its N-terminus [65,66]. Binding of the parkin
ubiquitin-like domain to the Eps15 UIM is required for
parkin-mediated Eps15 ubiquitination [66].
Conversely, only very few UBX domain proteins have
been studied in detail and no general function for the UBX
domain has yet emerged. Most of the UBX domain proteins identified so far can be grouped into four evolutionary conserved protein families represented by the human
Fas-associated factor-1 (FAF1), p47, Y33K, and Rep8 proteins [67]. Recent reports showed that the UBX domains
may act as general binding modules for p97 and/or p97
homologs, possibly representing a first common role for
UBX domains [68]. RAWUL domain seems to fall into the
UBX domain protein family since it is located at the C-terminus, comprise about 80 residues and the conserved
hydrophobic core of the Ubq fold. However, as far as we
know, UBX domains have not been found together with a
Ring finger domain or a WD40 repeat domain.
In the case of the poorly characterized WDR48-p80 family
[50-52], the association of WD40 repeats and RAWUL
domain could point out to a E3-ligase related function,
since WD40 repeats containing proteins are commonly
implicated in protein-protein interaction [69] and these
repeats have been recently described as key elements in E3
ubiquitin ligase complexes [70].
On the other side, our analysis revealed that the combination of a Ring finger domain at the N-terminus and a
RAWUL domain at the C-terminus is a key feature to
define the PRC1 Ring finger protein family, since no other
protein presents this domain architecture. The Ring finger

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/308

domains of the Ring (Ring1A and 1B) and Bmi1 proteins
are responsible for the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity [33,34],
whereas the region corresponding to the RAWUL domain
has been shown to mediate protein-protein interaction
with Pc and Ph [38-40]. The identification of an Ubq-like
domain in this region raise the possibility that these interactions could be establish through a yet uncharacterised
UIM present in Pc and Ph. However, due to the structural
similarities between the RAWUL domain and ubiquitin, it
is also possible that RAWUL could act as an auto-inhibitory domain, by direct competition with the substrate,
regulating specificities and/or ubiquitination capabilities
of the E3 ligase complex, as previously suggested for Ubqlike domains fused to ubiquitin-specific proteases [71], or
as a bridge, linking the proteasome and histone posttranslational modifications, as suggested for the Ubq-like
domain in the Ubiquitin plant homeodomain Ring finger
(UHRF) protein family [72].
Identification of plant and worm PRC1 Ring finger protein
orthologs
In the course of characterizing the PRC1 Ring finger proteins, we identified a set of proteins in Arabidopsis, Oryza
sativa, Vitis vinifera and worms that share the PRC1 ring
finger domain architecture, an N-terminal Ring finger
domain and a RAWUL domain at their C-terminal region
(Figure 1, 3 and 4). The preservation of domain architecture among these proteins indicates that these plant and
worm proteins are potential orthologs of animal PRC1
Ring finger proteins.

The Ring finger domain is highly abundant in plant proteins, with as many as 469 predicted Ring finger-containing proteins in the Arabidopsis genome [73]. The large
number of potential Ring finger proteins in Arabidopsis
suggests that target specific ubiquitination plays an
important role in protein regulation in plants. However,
the combination of the Ring finger domain and the
RAWUL domain, which is a specific feature of the PRC1
Ring finger proteins, is found in only a few plant proteins.
In Arabidopsis, there are four PRC1 Ring finger genes,
At1g03770, At5g44280, At2g30580 and At3g23060 that
codify the predicted proteins Q0WX00, estQ9FKW0,
Q94AY3 and Q9LS86, respectively. There are full length
cDNAs for these four genes with one open reading frame
predicted for each (the Arabidopsis information resource
(TAIR) database [74]. Online microarray expression data
proof that these genes are expressed [74].
Outside of these two domains, the plant proteins have
diverged significantly from their putative animal counterparts (Figure 4), but usually PcG protein orthologs do not
display sequence homology outside the conserved
domains, not only in evolutionary distant organisms but
also among paralogs in a given organism [75]. Taking into

account the fact that convergent evolution of domain
architectures is rare [76], the common domain architecture presented by the plants and animal PRC1 Ring finger
proteins (Figure 3) suggest a common evolutionary origin, raising the possibility that these plant proteins could

also take place in plant.

Pc, a subunit of PRC1 that recognizes and binds the
H3K27 marks created by PRC2. Similarly, PRC1 Ring finger proteins were thought to be missing in plants; however, our analysis revealed the presence of putative
orthologs to these proteins. All together these data suggest
that PRC1 is also conserved in plants, in agreement with
our analysis.

Plants were thought to have no homologs of PRC1 components. However, two recent reports (25,26) shows that

groups of PRC1 Ring finger proteins have been defined

and Mel18 and Drosophila Psc and Suppressor 2 of zeste
(Su(z)2), and the Ring subfamily that includes vertebrate
Ring1A, Ring1B and Drosophila dRing. In order to identify potential orthologous relationships between these
plant and animal homologous genes we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of this family. Due to the low degree of
sequence conservation in the C-terminal domain RAWUL
(see Figure 1), we add the N-terminal Ring domain, which
is highly conserved between plants and animals (Figure
4), to the phylogenetic analysis of the PRC1 Ring family.
The high confidence bootstrap value (997/1000) at the
connecting node (Figure 3) indicates that both subfamilies (Bmi1/Mel18 and Ring1A/1B) are clearly present
in plants (Figure 3). For instance, Arabidopsis Q0WX00
and estQ9FKW0 proteins are part of the Ring1A/1B subfamily, while Q94AY3 and Q9LS86 proteins are the
orthologs of the Bmi1/Mel18 subfamily. The identification of orthologous relationships between the two groups
including both plant and animal proteins suggests an
early gene duplication event, giving rise to Bmi1/Mel18
and Ring1A/1B subfamilies prior to the plant-animal
divergence. The plant and animal proteins therefore could
share a common biochemical function.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/308

characterizing the RAWUL domain allowed us to identify
putative PRC1 Ring finger proteins that were thought to
be missing in the plants and worms. The possibility that a
PRC1-like complex is also involved in PcG-mediated gene
silencing mechanism in these organisms is intriguing and
opens new avenues in PcG investigation.

Methods
Sequence analysis
We first performed BLAST sequence similarity searches
[41] against different protein sequence databases: UniProt
[42], NBCI [43], ENSEMBL [44] and JGI [45]. For the
sequence analysis we related distant protein families via
profile searches using global hidden Markov models:
HMMer [48] over the UniRef non redundant sequence
database [47] and HHpred over pdb70 profile database
[49]. The alignments were produced with the T-Coffee
and HMMer [46,48] using default parameters, slightly
refined manually and viewed with the Belvu program
[78]. Dendrogram were calculated with the neighbor-joining method [79] using ClustalW [80] and was edited with
Treetool [81]. The stability of different branches with
respect to different choices of subsets of residue positions
was checked by bootstrapping experiments (1000 replicates) [82]. For profile-profile comparison we used
HHpred software (version 1.2.0) downloaded from the
authors [49]. Global HMM profiles were done for each
family (PRC1 Ring and WDR48-p80) and subfamily
(Bmi1/Mel18 and Ring1A/B) using non-redundant alignments of the RAWUL domain (90% of sequence identity)
and removing gappy columns (>70%). We include these
profiles into the pdb70 HMM-database [49] before profile-profile searches were done. All the profile-profile
comparisons were done using default parameters and
without known (at Ubl family) or predicted secondary
structure information (hhsearch option – ssm 0).

Similarly, lower metazoans, such as nematodes, are also
thought to lack PRC1 homologs. In C. elegans, PcG-mediated gene repression has been proposed to require a
PRC2-like complex [77] and two novel proteins, Suppressor of Pal-1 (SOP-2) and Sop-2-related protein 1 (SOR-1)
[27,28]. Despite the lack of obvious sequence similarity,
several conserved properties between PRC1 and the putative SOP-2/SOR-1 complex suggested a conservation of
the mechanism [27,28]. However, these proteins are not
found in other organisms, including its closest related C.
briggsae [28], weakening the case for an alternative PRC1like complex. In addition, ubiquitinated H2A has been
detected by western blot analysis in C. elegans [31], indicating that some proteins may be involved in H2A ubiquitination. Interestingly, we found one PRC1 Ring finger
homolog in C. elegans and in C. briggsae (Figure 1 and 3).
The function of this PRC1 Ring finger homolog is so far
unknown. However, the conservation of the protein architecture, an N-terminal Ring finger and a C-terminal
RAWUL domain, suggest that the function of this protein
could be related to histone ubiquitination.

Protein-structure predictions and modeling
Secondary-structure predictions were performed with Predict Protein server [55]. Fold-recognition analyses were
performed with mGenThreader [56]. We generated structural models using Modeler [83] based on pdb structure
1gnu[84]. Models were evaluated using statistical mean
force potential [53]. The figure of the model was generated with Pymol program [85].

Conclusion

Authors' contributions

We detected statistically significant sequence similarity
between the ubiquitin superfamily and the conserved Cterminal regions of PRC1 Ring and WDR48-p80 families,
defining a new Ubq-like domain, the RAWUL domain.
The identification of an Ubq-like domain in the PRC1
Ring family offers new experimental approaches aimed at
elucidating their roles in important cellular processes,
such us, stem cell self-renewal and cancer. In addition,

LSP carried out the database search, sequence analysis and
drafted the manuscript. DD carried out the protein structure prediction and modelling, and helped to draft the
manuscript. ZRS participated in the coordination and
helped to draft the manuscript. MC conceived of the
study, and participated in its design and coordination and
