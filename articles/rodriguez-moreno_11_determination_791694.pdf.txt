having a nuclear origin

Abstract
Background: The melon belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, whose economic importance among vegetable
crops is second only to Solanaceae. The melon has a small genome size (454 Mb), which makes it suitable for
molecular and genetic studies. Despite similar nuclear and chloroplast genome sizes, cucurbits show great variation
when their mitochondrial genomes are compared. The melon possesses the largest plant mitochondrial genome,
as much as eight times larger than that of other cucurbits.
Results: The nucleotide sequences of the melon chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes were determined. The
chloroplast genome (156,017 bp) included 132 genes, with 98 single-copy genes dispersed between the small
(SSC) and large (LSC) single-copy regions and 17 duplicated genes in the inverted repeat regions (IRa and IRb). A
comparison of the cucumber and melon chloroplast genomes showed differences in only approximately 5% of
nucleotides, mainly due to short indels and SNPs. Additionally, 2.74 Mb of mitochondrial sequence, accounting for
95% of the estimated mitochondrial genome size, were assembled into five scaffolds and four additional
unscaffolded contigs. An 84% of the mitochondrial genome is contained in a single scaffold. The gene-coding
region accounted for 1.7% (45,926 bp) of the total sequence, including 51 protein-coding genes, 4 conserved ORFs,
3 rRNA genes and 24 tRNA genes. Despite the differences observed in the mitochondrial genome sizes of cucurbit
species, Citrullus lanatus (379 kb), Cucurbita pepo (983 kb) and Cucumis melo (2,740 kb) share 120 kb of sequence,
including the predicted protein-coding regions. Nevertheless, melon contained a high number of repetitive
sequences and a high content of DNA of nuclear origin, which represented 42% and 47% of the total sequence,
respectively.
Conclusions: Whereas the size and gene organisation of chloroplast genomes are similar among the cucurbit
species, mitochondrial genomes show a wide variety of sizes, with a non-conserved structure both in gene
number and organisation, as well as in the features of the noncoding DNA. The transfer of nuclear DNA to the
melon mitochondrial genome and the high proportion of repetitive DNA appear to explain the size of the largest
mitochondrial genome reported so far.

Background
The melon (Cucumis melo L.) is an important vegetable
crop grown in temperate, subtropical and tropical
regions worldwide. The melon belongs to the Cucurbitaceae family, which also comprises other vegetable
crops such as cucumber, watermelon, pumpkin and
squash, and whose economic importance among vegetable crops is second only to Solanaceae. C. melo is a
diploid species (2x = 2n = 24) with an estimated haploid
genome size of 454 Mb [1]. In recent years, extensive
research has been performed in melon to elucidate fruit
ripening processes, carotene accumulation and aroma
production [2]. In addition, genomic approaches to
melon breeding have been successfully applied to the
molecular characterisation of important agronomic
traits, such as pathogen resistance [3,4] and sex determination [5,6]. Recent research has increased the availability of genetic and genomic resources for melon [7], such
as the sequencing of ESTs [8,9], the development of an
oligonucleotide-based microarray [10], the construction
of BAC libraries [11-13], the production of mutant collections for TILLING analyses [14-16], the development
of a collection of near-isogenic lines (NILs) [17], the
construction of several genetic maps [9,18-22] and the
development of a genetically anchored BAC-based physical map [23].
The MELONOMICS project, aimed at sequencing the
complete melon genome using a whole-genome shotgun
strategy, was recently initiated by a Spanish consortium
[24]. Determination of the complete melon genome also
includes sequencing of the chloroplast (cpDNA) and
mitochondrial (mtDNA) genomes. As of 6 June 2011,
the NCBI databases contain 220 eukaryota plastid genome records [25]. Comparative studies have indicated
that the chloroplast genomes of land plants are highly
conserved in both gene order and gene content and are
moderately sized, between 130 and 150 kb [26]. In contrast, plant mitochondrial genomes range from 200 to
2,400 kb in size, which is at least 10 to 100 times the
size of typical animal mitochondrial genomes [27,28].
Cucurbitaceae possess the largest known plant mitochondrial genomes; however, species that belong to the
same genera within Cucurbitaceae and have similar
nuclear genome sizes show great size differences in their
mitochondrial genomes [27]. Experimental procedures
based on kinetic reassociation rate measurements have
predicted a melon mitochondrial genome of 2,400 kb,
the largest one among plants and animals and comparable in size to the genomes of many free-living bacteria
[27,29]. Recently, the mitochondrial genomes of Citrullus lanatus (watermelon) (379 kb) and Cucurbita pepo
(squash) (983 kb) have been determined [30]. Sequence
analysis of these mitochondrial DNAs has suggested

Page 2 of 14

that the increased genome size in this family reflects an
accumulation of chloroplast-derived and short repeated
sequences, whereas protein-coding regions are conserved across these species, with minor exceptions
[30,31]. In general terms, DNA transfer from organellar
genomes to nuclear DNA, and vice versa, appears to be
a common phenomenon associated with the redistribution of genetic material between nuclear and organellar
genomes [32-35]. Furthermore, a reduction in organelle
DNA content is linked to a gradual loss of the genetic
autonomy of organelles [34,36,37].
Next-generation sequencing platforms are rapidly
changing the field of genomics, allowing both re-sequencing and de novo sequencing of whole genomes with a
significant reduction in cost and time relative to conventional approaches. Nevertheless, only a few examples of
plastid genome next-generation sequencing have been
published so far and no plant mitochondrial genome
has been sequenced that way [38-44]. In this article, we
report the complete sequence of the melon chloroplast
genome obtained from BAC end sequences (BES), and
we report an estimated 95% of the melon mitochondrial
genome determined using Roche-454 sequencing technology. With a size over 2.7 Mb, the mitochondrial genome of melon represents the largest mitochondrial
genome sequenced so far. Data on the structure and
content of both organellar genomes and a comparison
to published cucumber chloroplast and watermelon and
squash mitochondrial genomes are presented.

Results and discussion
Organisation of the Cucumis melo chloroplast genome

The complete nucleotide sequence of the chloroplast
genome of melon (C. melo subsp. melo, PIT92) was
determined (GenBank Acc. No. JF412791). The genome
was 156,017 bp long and included a pair of inverted
repeats (IRa and IRb) of 25,797 bp separated by small
(SSC) and large (LSC) single-copy regions of 18,090 and
86,334 bp, respectively (Figure 1, Table 1). The GC content was found to be 36.9%, which is identical to that of
cucumber, the only other reported cucurbit chloroplast
genome [45-47], and to other sequenced plant chloroplast genomes.
The melon chloroplast genome contains 132 genes,
including 98 single-copy genes and 17 duplicated in IR
regions (Figure 1 and Table 2). The gene-coding regions
accounted for 59.7% of the genome and included 75
protein-coding genes and 6 conserved ORFs, 4 rRNA
genes and 30 tRNA genes, which represented 51.6%,
2.9% and 5.2% of the total sequence, respectively; cisspliced introns accounted for 12.1% of the genome. The
genes clpP, rps12 and ycf3 contained two introns, while
15 additional genes contained one intron each. The

Figure 1 Gene map of the Cucumis melo chloroplast genome. The nucleotide positions are numbered starting at the IRa/LSC junction and
extending clockwise. A pair of inverted repeats, IRb and IRa, located at coordinates 86,335 to 112,131 and 130,221 to 156,017, respectively,
separates the large single-copy region (LSC) from the small single-copy region (SSC).

rps12 gene was found to undergo trans-splicing, with
the 5’ exon located in the LSC region and the other two
exons located in both IR regions.
The border sequences between the IR, LSC and SSC
regions vary among different species. The pattern in
melon is similar to that in cucumber, as described in

[45]. In particular, IRa extended 1,199 bp into the ycf1
gene, and the IRb/SSC border was within the coding
regions of the ycf1-like and ndhF genes, which overlap
by 32 bp. The IRa/LSC border was located downstream
of the trnH-GUG gene, whereas the ψrps19 gene, present in that region in other species such as Arabidopsis
thaliana, was absent in both melon and cucumber.
Finally, the IRb/SSC border extended 2 bp into the 5’
coding region of the rps19 gene, as in cucumber.
The melon chloroplast genome was screened for simple
sequence repeats (SSRs), which resulted in the identification of 69 microsatellites that were at least 10 nt in length
(1 to 2 nt repeats) or contained at least four tandem repeat
units (3 to 6 nt repeats). All the microsatellites found were
shorter than 18 bp. SSRs accounted for 796 bp (0.5%) of
the total sequence, which was similar to the SSR content
estimated for the melon nuclear genome [48]. The poly
(A)/poly(T) microsatellite was the only mononucleotide
repeat found and represented 79.7% of all SSRs found.
Comparison of the cucumber and melon chloroplast
genomes

As of today, the chloroplast genome of only one cucurbit species, Cucumis sativus (cucumber), has been published [45-47]. Previous studies have suggested that
sequence analysis of chloroplast genes can be a valuable

tool for phylogenetic studies among closely related species [49,50]. Accordingly, and due to the highly polymorphic nature of the Cucurbitaceae family, a
comparison of the melon and cucumber chloroplast
genomes can provide useful information about the evolutionary relationships among cucurbit species.
The chloroplast genome sequence of the C. sativus
’Chipper’ line (GenBank Acc. No. DQ865976.1) was
compared to the melon genomic sequence reported

here. The cucumber genome was 494 bp shorter than
the melon genome, but overall only approximately 5%
of the nucleotide sequences were different, mainly due
to indels and SNPs (Table 3). Deletions in the melon
sequence, compared to cucumber, were found at 237
loci and represented 2,742 bp, or 1.76% of the cucumber
genome. Eighty-five percent of the deletions involved
the loss of less than 10 bp, while five deletions represented the loss of 125 to 379 bp. Insertions in the

melon sequence as compared to cucumber were found
at 188 loci representing 3,210 bp. Seventy-one percent
of these insertions involved the gain of less than 10 bp;
six insertions of 126 to 714 bp were also found. Additionally, we identified 2,250 SNPs, which represented
1.44% of the melon sequence.

Recombination mechanisms between direct repeat
sequences on the SSC/IR border regions have been
found to be responsible for the expansion/contraction of
the IR sequences, which can create large sequence variations in chloroplast genomes [45,51]. Significantly, the
area of highest diversity between the compared genomes

Rodríguez-Moreno et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:424

was found in the region located between the melon
sequence coordinates 126,000 and 130,000, close to the
SSC/IRa border. In particular, eight highly polymorphic
regions with a total length of 709 bp were found in this
region (Table 3).
An additional comparison between the amino acid
sequences of the melon and the cucumber chloroplastencoded proteins was performed, and the results are
shown in Additional file 1 Table S1. Except for ORF70
and the ycf1-like gene the annotation of both species
contained the same set of ORFs. Nevertheless, the published cucumber sequence contains ORFs homologous
to those of melon ORF70 and ycf1.
When the predicted protein sequences were BLASTed
against the non-redundant GenBank database, cucumber
was identified as the highest-scoring plant species for 72
of the 81 predicted coding genes (duplicated genes were
counted as one gene). With the exception of the rpl22
and accD genes, which had identity values of 91% and
82%, respectively, the rest of the 72 genes showed identity values higher than 95% when compared to their
cucumber homologues.
Five out of nine genes whose highest-scoring match
was not cucumber showed protein identities higher than
96%, although the identity values, when compared to
their cucumber homologues, were also high (Additional
file 1 Table S1). Finally, the predicted proteins with
lower identity to other plant chloroplast proteins were
those encoded by the clpP, ycf2 and, particularly, both
the ycf1 and ycf1-like genes.
Organisation of the Cucumis melo mitochondrial genome

After the isolation of intact mitochondrial organelles
from young melon leaves, mtDNA was extracted and
sequenced using the Roche-454 technology, and the
104,462 resulting reads were assembled as described in
the Methods section. BES from two different BAC
libraries [13] and whole genome sequences derived from
454 sequencing of 3-kb, 8-kb and 20-kb paired-end (PE)
libraries (unpublished) were also used to improve the
genome assembly.
The resulting sequence amounts to 2.74 Mb distributed
in five scaffolds of lengths 2,428,112 bp, 147,837 bp,
107,070 bp, 47,488 bp and 6,086 bp and four additional
unscaffolded contigs that totalled 1,809 bp. (Table 4).
The overall sequence coverage is 18-fold. The size of the
melon mitochondrial genome has previously been estimated to be approximately 2.4 to 2.9 Mb [27,30]. Based
on this estimate, we can assume that 95% of the mitochondrial genome has been assembled and that 84% of
the genome is contained in a single scaffold. Failure to
assemble all the reads in a single circular sequence can
be attributed to the high degree of repetitive sequences
found in this genome, as will be discussed later. However,

the existence of several subgenomic molecules that coexist inside the mitochondria, as has been described in
other species [52-54], cannot be ruled out. The contig
and scaffold sequences have been deposited in GenBank
under Accession Numbers JF412792 to JF412800.
The GC content of the mitochondrial genome was
found to be 44.5%, which is higher than that of the
chloroplast and nuclear melon genomes and similar to
the estimated GC content of the watermelon and squash
mitochondrial genomes [27]. Annotation of the
sequence was performed, and 67 genes were detected
(Tables 4 and 5). Gene-coding regions accounted for
1.7% of the genome (45,926 bp) and included 36 protein-coding genes and 4 conserved ORFs, 3 rRNA genes
and 24 tRNA genes, which represented 1.3%, 0.1% and
0.3% of the total sequence, respectively; cis-spliced
introns accounted for 1.8% of the genome. The genes
nad2, cox1, ccmFc, rpl2, rps3 and rps10 contained one
intron, nad4 contained three introns, and nad1, nad5
and nad7 contained four introns each. The nad1, nad2
and nad5 genes were found to undergo trans-splicing.
As of 6 June 2011, the mitochondrial genome
sequences of 32 Streptophyta have been deposited in
GenBank [25], including two cucurbit species: C.

lanatus (NC_014043) and C. pepo (NC_014050). Genes
homologous to all the predicted protein-coding genes
from the watermelon and squash mitochondrial genomes have been found in the annotated melon
sequence, with the exception of the rps19 gene. However, it is already known that this gene has been lost
from the mitochondrial genome in diverse species due
to transfer to the nucleus; in particular, cucumber,
which is phylogenetically closer to melon than both
watermelon and squash, has apparently recently lost this
gene [55]. Apart from the loss of the rps19 gene, some
differences were found regarding the number of tRNA
genes in the three cucurbit genomes. For example, while

two trnQ genes, two trnC genes and one trnK gene
were found in watermelon, only one trnQ gene and no
trnC or trnK genes were present in melon. However, it
is well known that even phylogenetically related species
differ substantially in their tRNA complement set (for
example, see [30] for cucurbits).
When the predicted protein sequences were BLASTed
against the non-redundant GenBank database, cucurbits
were identified as the highest-scoring plant species in
only 16 of all 40 predicted coding genes (Additional file
2 Table S2). This is in sharp contrast to the chloroplast
sequences discussed above, in which the majority of
melon proteins displayed the highest identity values

Rodríguez-Moreno et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:424
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/424

when compared to their cucumber homologues. The
identity values of the 16 proteins ranged from 78% (rps3
protein) to 99% (cob protein). However, RNA editing
events, which are known to frequently alter mitochondrial transcripts, have not been identified in melon
except for a limited number of cases. Therefore, the
actual identity values are expected to be somewhat
higher than our estimated values. Twenty out of 24
genes whose highest-scoring match was not a cucurbit
species showed protein identities higher than 90% for
the corresponding best hits. Finally, the predicted proteins with lower identity to other plant mitochondrial
proteins are those encoded by sdh3, ccmFn, rps1, rps4
and, particularly, ORF2, ORF3 and rps3.
For gene distribution along the mitochondrial chromosome, several small syntenic clusters are found when
the melon, watermelon and squash mitochondrial
sequences are compared (Additional file 3 Figure S1).
However, as has been described for watermelon and
squash, the distribution of these clusters reveals a high
level of genomic shuffling and rearrangement between
these three species [30].
Analysis of repetitive DNA, chloroplast and nuclearderived DNA

Although the gene content of melon is highly similar to
that of watermelon or squash, the melon mitochondrial
genome size is thrice that of squash and as much as
seven times that of watermelon. In fact, regions of DNA
as large as 600 kb could be found that contained no
protein-coding genes. Figure 2 shows a schematic representation of the gene density of the largest scaffold (2.43
Mb).
To establish the fraction of this huge genome that is
shared with the other two cucurbit mitochondrial genomes, all three sequences were cross-compared using
BLASTn. It has been previously reported that processes
such as nuclear or chloroplast DNA transfer to the
mitochondria and internal recombination of the mitochondrial genome lead to a high degree of sequence
rearrangement that can obscure any trace of homology
over time [30]. For this reason, a less conservative evalue of 1E-3 was chosen for the comparative analysis.
As a result, 173 kb (46%) and 163 kb (16.6%) of the
watermelon and squash mitochondrial genomes, respectively, were found to be homologous with the melon
sequence. In addition, 73% of these homologous regions
(119 kb from watermelon and 125 kb from squash)
were shared among all three species. Seventy-nine
regions longer than 500 bp accounted for 60% of the
total homologous sequence (1,000 homology regions
averaging 180 bp in length). These figures are in accordance with the generally accepted theory of watermelon
being phylogenetically closer to melon than to squash.

Page 8 of 14

The conserved mitochondrial-like sequence was found
to contain all the predicted ORFs except for ORF1 and
ORF4 (which are present in conserved regions in melon
and watermelon, but not squash), and so it can be concluded that the approximately 120 kb of conserved
sequence (32%, 12% and 4.4% of the watermelon, squash
and melon mitochondrial genomes, respectively) represented a core cucurbit mitochondrial genome present in
all three sequenced genomes. Also, the finding that
approximately 27% of the conserved melon and watermelon regions were not conserved in squash, and vice
versa, points to independent events that have directed
the evolution of these three genomes from a common
cucurbit ancestor. In any case, the previous data showed
that 95% of the melon mitochondrial genome had no
homology whatsoever with the mitochondrial sequences
of other cucurbits.
Previous reports have indicated that small, repetitive
DNAs contribute significantly to the expanded mitochondrial genome of cucumber, which is estimated to
be 1.8 Mb [31]. Therefore, the presence of SSRs, transposable elements, inverted repeat regions and tandem
and direct repeats was analysed. The mitochondrial
sequence contains 357 SSRs (one SSR every 7.7 kb) that
amounts to 4,071 bp (0.1% of the total sequence). All
the microsatellites were shorter than 21 bp, except for a
(GACT)7. This value is ten times lower than the estimated SSR content of the melon nuclear genome [48].
In comparison, the squash and watermelon mitochondrial genomes contain one SSR every 4.6 kb and 5.6 kb,
respectively (0.3% and 0.2% of the total sequence).
Therefore, microsatellites represent an insignificant portion of the melon mitochondrial genome and cannot
explain its large size. The presence of transposon-related
sequences was also investigated, but only small fragments that totalled 6,480 bp (0.23% of the total
sequence) were found to show homology to transposable
elements (mainly LTR retrotransposons). The search for
inverted repeat sequences (IRs) produced 427 pairs of
IRs, which amounted to 50,601 bp (1.8% of the available
mitochondrial sequence). Percent matches between IRs
were higher than 70%, with 137 pairs of IRs showing
values higher than 95%. The average repeat length was
82 bp; the longest IR found was 1,067 bp. In comparison, the IR contents of watermelon and squash were
also calculated, but only 14 IRs (1,497 bp) and 17 IRs
(2,096 bp) were found in those species, which is
between four and nine times lower than the melon IR
content. Therefore, the melon mitochondrial genome
was significantly enriched in sequences that can mediate
recombination events.
Regarding the tandem repeat content of the sequenced
genome, the analyzed sequence contained 449 tandem
repeats, which amounted to 41,212 bp or 1.5% of the

available sequence. The average period size and period
copy number were 39 and 3, respectively. The most
abundant type of tandem repeats were those with period
sizes of 29, 35 and 70, which totalled 40% of all tandem
repeats found and 56% of the tandem distributed
sequence. As a comparison, the tandem repeat contents
of watermelon and squash were also calculated, and 10
repeats (1,036 bp or 0.3% of the genome) and 236
repeats (19,060 bp or 1.9% of the genome), respectively,
were found. Therefore, while the relative tandem repeat
contents of melon and squash were similar, watermelon
showed a significantly reduced tandem repeat content in
its mitochondrial genome.
Additionally, the maximal repeat content and repeat
families of the mitochondrial genomes of watermelon,
squash and melon were calculated using two different programs (see Methods section). The RepeatScout program,
which detects repeats larger than 50 bp and excludes low
complexity sequences, predicted 101 repeat families (with
an average copy number per family of 35) in melon, 13
families (with an average copy number per family of 34) in
squash and 2 families (with an average copy number per
family of 3) in watermelon. The most abundant repeat

families for the compared mitochondria consisted of 365
copies of approximately 120-bp-long repeats for melon
and 90 copies of approximately 173-bp-long repeats for
squash. Only 3 repeats were found to be longer than the
average read length, which is 399 nt. Incidentally, the fact
that the most abundant repetitions are shorter than the
average 454 read length implies that, in those cases, the
454 reads extends the repetitions and result in the correct
assembly of reads. Therefore, although the existence of
mis-assemblies of repetitive sequences cannot be completely rule out, mis-assemblies probably affect our proposed
sequence to a much lower degree that could be guessed
based only on the high repeat content of the genome.
We also searched for exact repeats longer than 20 bp
using REPuter (results summarised in Table 6). Similar
to the findings reported for squash [30], we found a significant content of short repeats in the mitochondrion
of melon. Our numbers for squash and watermelon
were slightly lower compared to data obtained in [30]
because we looked only for exact repeats, but the differences among the genomes analysed are clear. The mitochondrion of melon is much richer in large repeats than
that of squash.

Chloroplast-derived DNA accounts for as much as 9%
of sequenced plant mitochondrial genomes [56]. The
melon chloroplast genome described above was used to
identify mitochondrial sequences of putative chloroplast
origin. In all, 35 mitochondrial regions that ranged from
61 to 10,578 bp (average 1.1 kb) and totalled 38.6 kb or
1.4% of the mitochondrial genome, showed homology
with the melon chloroplast sequence. On the other
hand, 54 kb or 35% of the melon chloroplast genome
showed homology to the mitochondrial genome. The
38.6 kb difference in the chloroplast-derived mitochondrial sequence was due to duplicated regions in the
chloroplast genome. As a comparison, watermelon’s
mitochondrion contains 23 kb of chloroplast-like
sequences, while squash’s mitochondrion contains 113
kb, which represents approximately 80% of other
sequenced cucurbit chloroplast genomes such as those
of melon and cucumber. Therefore, no correlation
seems to exist between the mitochondrial sizes of these
three species and their chloroplast-derived sequence
content.
Finally, nuclear-derived sequences have been detected
in several plant mitochondrial genomes and amount to
up to 7% of their size [30,57]. In watermelon and
squash, approximately 20 kb of nuclear-like sequences,
most of which resemble retrotransposable elements,
have been found. Although the contribution of retrotransposons to the expanded melon mitochondrial genome is negligible, as discussed above, the BLASTing of
361 Mb of the melon nuclear genome draft sequence
obtained in our laboratories (unpublished data) against
the mitochondrial sequence produced 1,114 mitochondrial regions that ranged from 193 bp to 10,355 bp and
that totalled 1,272,615 bp (46.5% of the available mitochondrial sequence). Significantly, even when only the
413 homologous fragments longer than 1 kb were considered, more than 33% of the available mitochondrial
sequence still showed homology with melon nuclear
regions. The analysis of those 37 mitochondrial homologous regions longer than 4 kb and totalling ca. 200 kb
showed that the average identity between the mitochondrial and nuclear regions was 91% with values ranging
from 84 to 96%. The detailed analysis of two of these

regions with lengths 4,220 and 4,044 bp and identities
of 94% and 89% relative to their nuclear counterparts,
showed a transition/transversion mutation ratio of 2.2
and 3.8 respectively, with C Mit ® T Nuc and G Mit ®
ANuc the most abundant mutations found, and CMit ®
ANuc the most representative transversion mutations.
Twenty-seven indels totalling 70 nt and five gaps of
between 11 and 60 nt were also found.
Interestingly, all 37 regions analyzed but three displayed high levels of sequence identity with at least two
different nuclear regions, therefore suggesting a relationship between the repetitive nuclear DNA and the mitochondrial DNA of putative nuclear origin.
A large fraction of the mitochondrial gene-containing
regions and some chloroplast-like regions in the mitochondria showed homology with the nuclear sequence,
as was expected because many mitochondrial genes
have homologous counterparts in the nuclear genome.
Also, DNA transfer from the chloroplast to the mitochondrion has been known to occur. When these
regions were not considered, 1.14 Mb of mitochondrial
sequence still showed homology to nuclear sequences.
In all, nearly half of the melon mitochondrial genome
seemed to be of nuclear origin; therefore, the transfer of
DNA from the nucleus can, at least partially, explain the
large size of this mitochondrial genome. However, the
nature of approximately 1.5 Mb of mitochondrial
sequence remains to be elucidated.

Conclusions
Whereas the size and gene organisation of the chloroplast genome were similar among cucurbit species, the
mitochondrial genomes showed a wide variety of sizes,
with a non-conserved structure both in gene number
and organisation, as well as in the features of the noncoding DNA; nevertheless, we identified a minimum
cucurbit genome core of 119 kb between melon, watermelon and squash with a high level of nucleotide
sequence conservation. In addition to a high proportion of repetitive DNA content in melon, compared to
watermelon and squash, the transfer of nuclear DNA
to the melon mitochondrial genome seems to explain
the size of the largest mitochondrial genome reported
so far.
Methods
Source of the chloroplast genome sequences

A melon random-shear BAC library had been previously
constructed and the BES from 16,128 clones determined
[13]. The average sequence length was 534 bp. The BES
were then filtered using the cucumber chloroplast genome sequence (GenBank Acc. No. DQ865976.1) as a
reference, and 5,785 BES totalling 3.2 Mb were found to
show homology with the cucumber sequence.

Chloroplast genome assembly, annotation and analysis

The selected BES were assembled using the Sequencher
4.1.1 software package with a minimum overlap of 15
and a minimum match of 85%. Due to the presence of
an inverted repeat in the chloroplast genome of plant
species, a final step of manual assembly was required to
obtain a final contig of 5,683 sequences that represented
the melon chloroplast genome.
The consensus sequence was then annotated using the
DOGMA online organellar annotation tool [58]. The
predicted ORFs, including cis- and trans-splicing sites,
were manually checked by comparison with all other
published chloroplast genes, and several changes were
then introduced into the DOGMA preliminary annotation to produce the final annotated sequence. A graphical representation of the annotated genome was
produced using the CGViewer Server [59].
The melon and cucumber chloroplast genome
sequences were aligned using MEGA4 software to detect
polymorphisms between these species. The predicted
chloroplast-encoded proteins were analysed for homology with other known proteins using the GenBank nonredundant protein database and the BLASTP software.
Microsatellites were searched using msatcommander
0.8.2 software [60]. SSRs considered for the final dataset
included 1- to 2-nt repeats of at least 10 nt in length
and 3- to 6-nt repeats with at least four unit repetitions.
Plant material

Melon seeds from the double haploid line PIT92
(derived from the cross PI 161375 × T111) were germinated inside a Petri dish in a dark growth chamber for 3
days at 25°C. After germination, the seeds were planted
in pots that contained synthetic soil and maintained in a
greenhouse at 26 ± 2°C and with day/night cycles of 16/
8 h, respectively. The PIT92 melon line was also used
for construction of BAC libraries [12,13] and has been
used for whole genome sequencing (Garcia-Mas et al.,
unpublished).
Isolation of mitochondrial DNA from intact mitochondria

Intact mitochondrial organelles were isolated from
young melon leaves according to a modification of a
previously described method [61]. Fifty grams of young
melon leaves were manually harvested, cut into 10- to
20-mm lengths and ground in a Polytron PT2000
homogeniser with 120 ml of grinding medium at 4°C.
The homogenate was filtered through four layers of
Miracloth, placed into 6 × 50 ml Nalgene tubes and
centrifuged for 5 min at 3,200 rpm with a JA14 rotor in
a Beckman Coulter centrifuge (Avanti J-26 XP). The
supernatant was then re-centrifuged for 20 min at
13,600 rpm, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in
5 to 10 ml of 1× wash buffer, transferred to a 50 ml

Page 11 of 14

Nalgene tube and centrifuged for 5 min at 3,200 rpm
with a JA17 rotor. After centrifugation, the supernatant
was transferred to a new tube and re-centrifuged at
13,600 rpm for 20 min. The resulting pellet was thoroughly dispersed with a fine paintbrush in 5 ml of washing buffer, layered over a 0 to 5% PVP gradient made
earlier and centrifuged for 40 min at 21,000 rpm in a
Beckman Coulter ultracentrifuge (Optima L-90 K). After
centrifugation, the mitochondria formed a white-yellow
colour band toward the bottom of the gradient, which
was carefully recovered with a syringe, transferred to a
new 50-ml Nalgene tube with 1× wash buffer and concentrated in a pellet with 3 wash centrifugation steps at
13,600 rpm for 15 min. After organelle isolation, mitochondrial DNA was lysed and purified as described [62].
Mitochondrial genome sequencing and assembly

Sequencing was performed using the Roche Genome
Sequencer FLX System on 1/8 of a Titanium Microtitre
Plate. The filtering process was passed by 120,802
sequences, which contained 48,154,028 bases with an
average length of 399 nt. Duplicate reads were identified
using the cd-hit-454 program [63], and 104,462 nonredundant reads were assembled using Newbler (version
2.5 beta) to produce a set of contigs totalling 2.711 Mb.
The obtained contigs (except for the 64 contigs out of
539 that had < 10× coverage) were used as a query for
BLASTing [64] against additional pools of sequences
(obtained from the same genotype, PIT92, used in this
study) that were available in our laboratory: BES from
two different BAC libraries [13] and whole genome
sequences derived from Roche 454 sequencing of 3-kb,
8-kb and 20-kb paired-end libraries (unpublished). Raw
BESs were filtered and trimmed for quality and vector
contamination using SeqTrim [65]. Only BESs that had
> 98% identity to the query for over 80% of their length
were considered. In cases in which the BESs were paired
(when both 5’ and 3’ ends of the same BAC insert were
available), both pairs were taken if only one pair met
the described conditions. At the end, there were 1,822
BESs (97.5% paired) used in this study. For the 454
whole genome PEs, we created a database from a subset
of nonredundant and “true” PEs (sequences that contained the 454 linker flanked on each side by > 50 nt of
sequence). We retrieved sequences that had > 99% identity to the query and ended up with 10,724 3-kb, 14,723
8-kb and 2,683 20-kb PEs.
Assemblies were performed using two different programs: Newbler (version 2.5 beta) and MIRA (version
2). Newbler is able to sort contigs into scaffolds using
the PEs but is often unable to incorporate conserved
repeats into these scaffolds, which leaves gaps of
approximated sizes based on paired-end insert distances
(repeats are often assembled into “collapsed” contigs

Rodríguez-Moreno et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:424
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/424

that remain orphaned after the assembly). In contrast,
MIRA is unable to build scaffolds, but it tries to differentiate copies of conserved repeats and include them
with the rest of non-repeat contigs. Therefore, contigs
derived from MIRA were used, when possible, to close
the gaps in the scaffolds obtained with Newbler or to
join two or more scaffolds. A detailed summary with the
metrics of the assembly process can be found in the
Additional file 4 Table S3.

Mitochondrial genome annotation and analysis

A nucleotide database was built that contained the predicted cDNAs from all the sequenced Streptophyta
mitochondrial genomes, as previously published [25].
BLASTN searches were performed, and each individual
ORF found was checked by comparison with all other
mitochondrial proteins published; several changes were
then introduced to produce the final annotated
sequence. Structural RNA genes were identified using
tRNAscan-SE 1.21 (for tRNAs) and RNAmmer 1.2 (for
rRNAs) software [66,67].
The predicted mitochondrially encoded proteins were
analysed for homology with other known proteins using
the GenBank non-redundant protein database and the
BLASTP software. Microsatellites were searched using the
msatcommander 0.8.2 software. SSRs considered for the
final dataset included 1- to 2-nt repeats of at least a 10 nt
length and 3- to 6-nt repeats with at least four unit repetitions. Transposable-related sequences were identified
using CENSOR online (with default sensitivity parameters
and Arabidopsis thaliana as a reference DNA source) [68].
Tandem repeats were analysed using the Tandem Repeats
Finder software [69] (min. align. score 60; max. period size
2,000). Inverted repeats were detected using the Inverted
Repeats Finder software [70] (match 2; mismatch 3; delta
5; match probability 80; indel probability 10; Minscore 40;
Maxlength to report 500,000; MaxLoop 500,000). Two different programs were used to look for duplicated DNAs
and to repeat family classification in the sequences of
interest: REPuter and RepeatScout, respectively, with
default parameters [71,72]. Results from REPuter were
analysed to avoid overestimating the total repeat content
due to repeat overlaps.
Nuclear-like mitochondrial regions were identified by
performing a BLASTN with e-value < 1E-100 (corresponding approximately to a hit of 200 nt and 90% identity or a 400 nt hit with 85% identity) against a melon
nuclear genome draft that has been produced in our
laboratories [Garcia-Mas et al., manuscript in preparation]. Chloroplast-like regions were identified by performing a BLASTN analysis with e-value < 1E-40
against the assembled melon chloroplast genome
reported in this paper.
