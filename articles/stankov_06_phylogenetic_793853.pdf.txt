Abstract
Background: For the purposes of phylogenetic inference from molecular data sets many different methods are
currently offered as alternatives for researchers in phylogenetic systematics. The vast majority of these methods
are based on specific topological assumptions relating to the resultant genealogical tree. Each of these has been
shown to perform effectively in special conditions and for specific data sets while yielding less reliable results in
other instances. Moreover, the majority of the methods include information from homoplastic characters in spite
of a universally accepted agreement in their ineffectiveness for phylogenetic inference, which may often lead to
inaccuracy and inconsistency. As an alternative to such methods, a strict mutational compatibility consensus tree
building method as a universally applicable and reliable method is reported.
Results: The analysis of a data set from a previously published experimental phylogeny demonstrates the
accuracy of the strict mutational compatibility consensus tree building method and illustrates its potential for
obtaining unambiguous and precise results with full resolution.
Conclusion: The universal applicability of a simplified compatibility method in its algorithmic form for
phylogenetic inference is described. Firstly, dismissal of topological assumptions creates a general potential for
agreement of inferred with true phylogeny. Second, exclusion of irregular characters from analysis repeatably
enables construction of consistent phylogeny. Third, a direct calculation of bootstrap proportion values for
individual nodes of the resulting tree is possible rather than their empirical estimation. Finally, guidance is given
for empirical assessment of the sample size necessary for full genealogical resolution and significant bootstrap
proportions.

[1-3]. The general strategy of current character-based
methods for an appropriate tree reconstruction from a
homologous sequence set relies in the first place on an
assumed tree for a given set of taxa. Next, this tree is fitted
by various optimality criteria to the partition of character
states of an individual character on the taxa, the procedure
is repeated for each character and finally a tree is used
which best fits all of the characters taken together [1,4].
But, is there a guarantee that all possible tree topologies
are considered in the first place? If not, there is also no
guarantee that the tree chosen will be the one that absolutely fits to the data. Looking at the topological assumptions made by the current phylogenetic methods, three of
them are commonplace in most cases:
a) Analysed taxa are placed exclusively at the terminal
nodes of a tree,
b) Each node is labelled by exactly one taxon (either one
from the analysed set or one representing a missing ancestor), and
c) The tree is strictly a bifurcating one.
However, there could be no justification for any one of
these assumptions. In order to find a tree which fits most
to the data, all these assumptions must be rejected, since
each of them unnecessarily restricts the set of possible
solutions to a particular set of possible topologies. Moreover, instead of first assuming a tree and then finding its
fitness to the data, one should start from the data, keeping
initial assumptions at a minimum and then let the data
create the tree themselves without any further inference
from the analyst.

Results
Results of the analysis by the Potomak algorithm of a
sequence set (Table 1 in [5]) of T7 phage experimental
phylogeny [6] at its consecutive steps are shown in Figures
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The accuracy of the resulting tree
topology was judged by the proportion of observed
monophyletic groups of known elements which have
counterparts in the experimental plan that are identical by
their composition. Figure 10 shows 15 planned monophyletic groups, while Figure 11 shows 13 observed

groups, each of which corresponds to one planned group.
Hence, the method yielded completely accurate topology.
Groups P3 and P12 were not retrieved on the resulting
tree indicating incomplete branching resolution because
of relatively small sequence length taken into account.
With regard to the statistical assessment of the topological
precision, there are 10 out of 13 nodes in total (except the
root) with significant support, with insignificant values
obtained for G7, G13 and G16.

Discussion
Parsimony and compatibility are often regarded as very
similar methods, hence their properties and utility are
generally considered almost equal [4]. The basic difference however, which is overlooked or neglected is the different treatment of homoplastic characters. Whilst
parsimony takes into account all characters equally, compatibility makes differences between regular and homoplastic characters and excludes the latter from primary
phylogenetic analysis. As a result of a compatibility
method, there is always a unique tree, truly reflecting the
evolutionary relationships between characters and consequently between analysed elements, whilst results of parsimony analysis are often ambiguous, being represented
by numerous equally parsimonious trees.
"If each site in a set of sequences has changed only once
in the evolution of a group, then the newly-arisen base
will be shared by all species descended from the lineage in
which the change occurred. If this were the case at all sites,
then the sets of species having the new bases would be
either perfectly nested or disjoint, never overlapping
unless one set of species was included in the other. It
would be possible to erect a tree on which we could
explain the evolution of the group with only a single
change at each site. This can be done by inspection of the
sets of species defined at each varying site. If some of these
sets of species overlap without being nested, then there is
conflict between the information provided by different
sites. Most of the interesting issues in phylogeny reconstruction are in how to resolve these conflicts." [4]
Strategies for resolving homoplasy as revealed by incompatible characters could be divided into two basic categories: a) adaptation of a tree to the full scope of the data, so

that the apparent homoplasy on the tree is minimal, and
b) recognition of incompatible characters and their exclusion from the phylogenetic analysis [7]. Both approaches
regard homoplasy as disturbing, adverse phenomenon.
Proponents of the first approach argue that exclusion of
homoplastic characters discards information which is still
informative regardless of its imperfection. Such a statement is very much alike to a statement that listening to a
noise mixed with a pure melody contributes to the artistic
value of the melody. As stated by Page and Holmes [8],
"homoplasy is a poor indicator of evolutionary relationships, because similarity does not reflect shared ancestry."
Since incompatible characters are irrelevant and add no
apparent benefit whilst imposing a substantial obstacle to
phylogenetic inference, their exclusion from at least primary genealogical analysis is fully justified. Once a regular
tree has been formed, irregular markers could be used for
elucidation of the natural history of reversions, parallelisms and also recombinations. Thus, reverse mutations
form paraphyletic groups rooted by the marker which has
subsequently reverted, whilst parallel mutations form
polyphyletic groups, each monophyletic subgroup of
which is being rooted by the same marker. Recombinations usually cause multiple parallelisms or multiple
reversions within a single element, whereby markers
placed between these are always younger, formed after the
moment of recombination. Hence, most of recombinations can also be detected on the resulting tree. A detailed

Absence of topological assumptions allows any tree topology to be deduced from the data, including polytomies of
unlimited size. Besides the strategy of tree construction
directly from the integrity of the (compatible) data at
hand, the presented method differs from the classical
compatibility methods in the creation of groups of equivalent markers to simplify the analysis. While the accuracy
of the SMCC tree in relation to the analysed data is
ensured by the presented Potomak algorithm, a tree
resulting from clique analysis, even in case that the maximal consensus clique is taken may not be true simply
because of topological restrictions imposed by individual
character state trees used for formation of the final tree.
Character state changes are here analogous to binary factors of directed non-binary cladistic characters. Multiple
markers at the same site must comprise mutually disjoint
haplotype sets because one haplotype can have only one
character state at one site. Consequently, a star phylogeny
for the respective character state tree is in principle
assumed. However, eventual irregular markers at this site
are subsequently discarded. SMCC tree is most closely
related to a tree obtained by clique analysis of binary data
when maximal consensus clique is used for tree construction. Thus, when the T7 data set as given in Figure 1 is analysed by program Clique, package Phylip version 3.64 [9]
the only topological differences of the output tree in relation to the SMCC tree in Figure 9 are placements of R and
K according to the unjustified assumption a) above at separate branches with zero character state changes for each
of them. Since their length equals zero, they are artificial,
i.e. non-existing in reality. Otherwise, designations of
character changes along each branch entirely correspond
to the ones on the SMCC tree (Additional file 1). The consensus of mutually compatible character state changes
should not be confused with consensus trees, namely trees
chosen by certain criteria from a forest previously
obtained by current tree-to-data adapting methods. So it
is the compatibility consensus, not a consensus tree which
is referred to here.

Accuracy of the method
Comparing the SMCC tree topology for the experimental
T7 phylogeny (Figure 9) with the phylogeny of T7 as
planned and conducted by Hillis et al. [6], one should
note that there are three points of disagreement: first, in
the SMCC tree there is no common ancestor for K and L
after X2; there is also no common ancestor for O and P
after X4; and third, L originates directly from K instead
from their common ancestor. How could these discrepancies be explained? First, one should make an accurate distinction between haplotype genealogy and reproductive
genealogy. What is directly revealed by the genetic charac-

ter analysis is haplotype genealogy. Conversely, reproductive genealogy could be directly revealed only by the direct
observation of reproductive history of organisms, as in
this case, which was undertaken throughout the experiment with T7 phage. In the absence of such a possibility,
haplotype genealogy is used for indirect inference of the
former. For the total agreement of two genealogies however, enough genetic markers for discerning each step in
the corresponding reproductive history of analysed elements must be observed. Here, a relatively small segment
of T7 genome yielded 13 regular groups in total. One
could expect that almost certainly the above mentioned
discrepancies would be solved with the inclusion of additional genome segments in analysis. However, it could
have also been the case that throughout the whole
genome only these 13 groups were recorded. In that case
it would have been impossible to reveal the true reproductive history by genetic analysis.

groups (G) comprise all markers (M) related to identical haplotype (H) sets given in parentheses. Numbers between designations for groups and markers denote numbers of
markers in each group.

Mutation model assumed
In reality, a genealogical method should take into account
the deterministic nature of the DNA replication process as
well as the exceptional nature of mutational occurrence.
This forms precisely the basis of the first step of any phylogenetic analysis – establishment of identity-by-descent
as a basic feature of homologous characters. An important
mutation model which has proven its value in population
genetics and which fully respects the exceptional nature of
mutational occurrence is the 'infinite sites model' [10,11].
It is a universally applicable model even when data comprises some fast-changing sites for the following reason.
Homology as an obligate pre-requisite implies identity of
a substantial proportion of characters across all taxa analysed. For these sites, the mutation rate equals zero. Since
there is no discontinuous transition from sites with zero
mutation rate to a high mutation rate, there is always a
class of sites with a minimal mutation rate fully conforming to the infinite sites model, and this class of sites is precisely the one most valuable for phylogenetic inference.
But what happens when numerous sites are identified
with high mutation rates? Fast-changing sites usually
imply the appearance of many irregular markers in the
data set, leaving paucity of regular ones for construction of
the SMCC tree. As a consequence, relatively low resolution is obtained. In such unpleasant situations we just
have to accept the fact that the available data are simply
not suitable and do not allow for proper phylogenetic
analysis. Such an example is shown in Additional files 2
and 3. The aligned bacterial ribosomal RNA sequences are
nearly randomized, with typical pairwise similarities
below 50%, yielding paucity of regular markers and
poorly resolved SMCC tree with insignificant BS values.
With such sets, any phylogenetic analysis reduces to a
pure guesswork – a procedure that could be equally well
conducted even without looking at sequence data, thus

saving the efforts and costs of sampling and DNA
sequencing.
Dependence of resolution on the sample size taken
Low resolution means that there are many analysed elements placed in groups of two or more at individual
nodes. One may refer to this kind of resolution as 'apparent resolution', which differs from the branching resolution (i.e. resolution between hidden ancestors) described
in the results section, however one should bear in mind
that both depend on much the same factor. How should

this problem be managed? "If the largest clade contains
very few characters, then skepticism concerning the suitability of the data set for promoting a valid estimate of evolutionary history is justified. The ability of character
compatibility analysis to fail in this manner should be
considered an advantage: One is less likely to propose a
tree based on insubstantial evidence." [12] The Potomak
algorithm offers a clue for the choice of the minimal
sequence length sufficient for full genealogical resolution
given the number of elements taken for analysis when a
pilot study revealing the occurrence and frequency of regular marker groups has already been conducted. In a tree
with full resolution, each node must be labelled by not
more than one element. The number of regular marker
groups must in that case be greater than the number of
elements analysed. Assuming that marker group frequency for an unresolved tree increases linearly with
sequence length for a fixed number of analysed elements
(N), and taking into account the analysed DNA length (l)
and the number of groups (n, less than N) obtained in a
pilot study, the minimal length needed would be (N/n) l.
However, if the objective were a tree with all its nodes
being significantly supported, a different criterion would
have to be used. For fully resolved trees, one could not
expect that the number of marker groups increases further.
Instead, with increasing sequence length g values rise linearly for each group, with highest increase rate for largest
groups and lowest rates for smallest groups as a consequence of different evolution rates for different branches.
One could in principle assume a linear distribution of g
values for a particular sample size yielding full resolution.
For a precise estimate of group sizes for any DNA length
one should have data from multiple sampling examples
so that the function of the slope change is elucidated.
However, for the most optimistic estimate one could rely
on one sampling example on assumption that the regression line slope does not change significantly. In our example, taking into account eleven g values in decreasing
order for non-singleton groups (for more precise calcula-

tion), one gets a linear regression function y = 8.04 - 0.57
x. Here, for x = 13 (corresponding to the last node) the
estimated value for the group size is 0.6. In order that the
estimated g value for the last group reaches 3 (sufficient
for significant BS), estimated group sizes should rise for
2.4, with the size of the largest group reaching 10.4. Taking the size of the largest group as most precisely correlating to the sequence length sampled, for achieving the
above mentioned condition one should take the sequence
length of (10.4/8) × 1091 = 1417 units.
Consistency of the method
One should also note that the tree is consistent in a sense
that all partitions found with a certain sequence segment
are preserved when longer segments which include the
first segment are analysed, along with further nested
grouping of elements within previously obtained groups.
This feature is analogous with taking pictures at increasingly higher resolutions. For example, on a low-resolution
picture of a man only head, trunk and extremities may be
discernible. At a higher resolution one could observe further details on the head – eyes and nose; on extremities –
hands and feet etc., whereby initial division of the body
into head, trunk and extremities as noted at low resolution remains preserved. The only case in which this tree
consistency might be disturbed is definition of a monophyletic group by a marker group which with a greater
sequence length turns out to be irregular. This can happen
most often with singleton groups, less frequently with
groups with two markers and extremely rarely with g values of 3 or more. A further example of the applicability of
the presented algorhitm on natural sequence sets is given
in Additional file 4, where the feature of consistency is
clearly shown.

No simulations were attempted with the described
method because "the conclusions of such studies all too

conditions for which they work well, and other conditions
for which they work poorly. It is relatively easy to identify
the optimal conditions of a favourite method, and then
present simulation results that compare competing methods only at this optimum. Such results are of very limited
interest, but the conclusions drawn from such studies
often are presented as if they were general." [13]

Method
Methodology for reconstruction of a strict mutational
compatibility consensus (SMCC) tree without topological
assumptions – general principles
Each individual (taxon, evolutionary unit, element) in a
given set is represented by a single nucleotide or amino
acid sequence. A character state change (point mutation,
insertion or deletion), defined as a triad of the ancestral
sequence unit, unit position and the derived sequence
unit is called a marker. Markers are in principle mutually
independent. However, deletions or insertions of two or
more consecutive bases are due to their interdependence
counted as a single marker. As with other methods, a necessary pre-requisite is the appropriate sequence alignment
[14,15].

Phylogenetic reconstruction begins with the designation
of the original sequence. Often, this sequence is not
known, so one has to choose a sequence which genealogically does not belong to the analysed group (outgroup),
but is similar enough so that the ancestral character states
are properly designated.
Once established derived state reproduces through next
generations, forming a set of haplotypes bearing the
derived state (marker's haplotype set, or simply marker
set). Further, a second marker formed within an element
of this set relates to a set of haplotypes which represents
its subset etc. In other words, regular marker set relationships are such that a haplotype set of a marker formed earlier in the course of the genealogical history completely
includes one formed later in an element already bearing
the derived state of the first marker. Such evolutionary scenario leads to the formation of 'compatible characters'.
Relations of compatibility concerning morphologic characters were given due consideration by Hennig [16] and a
procedure for testing compatibility of phylogenetic
hypotheses under the term "consistency" was developed
by Wilson [17]. The specific algorithm for the examination of character compatibility and selection of compatible binary characters was given by Le Quesne [18],
generalized later for multistate characters by Estabrook
[19,20]. Finally, Meacham and Estabrook [12] highlighted the importance of exclusion of incompatible characters for phylogenetic analysis. A phylogeny created by

List of haplotype paths
List of haplotype paths. Each haplotype (H) is associated
with a unique path formed exclusively from regular, mutually
compatible marker groups. Paths are represented by chains
of marker groups (G), haplotype sets of which all include the
respective haplotype. Each set in a chain completely includes
its right neighbor. Numbers in brackets denote numbers of
equivalent markers in respective groups. Groups without
numbers in brackets are singleton groups.
compatible characters has been called by computer scientists a "perfect phylogeny", one formed exclusively by
nested sets of elements such that for any two sets one
completely includes or excludes the other [7,21]. In contrast, markers formed by reverse mutations may only partially include smaller sets, while parallel mutations may
comprise marker sets which are only partially included by
larger sets. Since their relationships to other sets are not
regular with respect to perfect phylogeny, such markers
are referred to as 'irregular markers'. For proper construction of a regular tree, all irregular markers should first be
recognized and excluded from further analysis, so that a
strict consensus of compatible markers remains. Finally,
forking chains of immediate inclusions of regular marker
sets growing from the root form a unique strict mutational
compatibility consensus (SMCC) tree. Here, a marker
group uniquely labels each node, and haplotypes are
located at nodes labelled by the marker group with the
smallest haplotype set in which they appear. Looking at a
particular node, three possibilities for its resulting haplotype labels may arise. First, concerning the monophyletic
group rooted at the node, all mutually exclusive monophyletic subsets of the group rooted in neighboring distal
nodes together include all haplotypes of the group. In this
case the node is represented by an unknown haplotype,
not present in the given data set. Second, the above men-

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/5

tioned subsets taken together include all but one element
of the group, meaning that the node is represented by this
missing element. Finally, when two or more elements are
not included in any of the distal subsets, the node is
labelled by all of them at the same time.
Potomak – algorithm for SMCC tree reconstruction from
homologous sequence data with results from an example
of experimental phylogeny
For the purpose of clarity, the algorithm for construction
of an SMCC tree is here presented along with its results in
each step of analysis of a sequence set (Table 1 in [5]) of
T7 phage experimental phylogeny [6].

1. Sequences, including the original or outgroup, have to
be presented in the form of alignment (Fig. 1),
2. List of haplotypes is formed, where each element is represented by the first one in each group of identical
sequences (Fig. 2),
3. Designation of the original haplotype,
4. Marker list is formed on which each mutation in relation to the original sequence is shown as a marker. Each
marker on the list relates to the corresponding set of haplotypes bearing the marker, or more precisely its derived
character state (Fig. 3),
5. List of groups of equivalent markers (or simply marker
groups) is formed by grouping markers related to identical sets of haplotypes. Numbers associated with marker
groups denote numbers of markers included in each
group (Fig. 4),
6. Those marker groups whose haplotype sets partially
include each other are recognized as conflicting groups.
All conflicting relations are then summarized and presented in one summary table of conflicts. Then, the minimal combination of markers is chosen which, when
removed from the summary table removes all the conflicting relations so that the table disappears (Fig. 5). Markers
included in this minimal combination are designated as
irregular (homoplastic) markers, while the rest represents
the maximal combination of compatible characters. In
special cases when there are two or more minimal combinations which lead to removal of the table of conflicts, all
characters appearing in any one of them are considered
irregular and hence excluded from further analysis. In this
case one does not get a strict maximal set of compatible
markers, but strict consensus set of compatible markers
leading to a unique, unambiguous directed tree.
7. Next, the inclusion list for regular marker groups
presents for each group all other groups whose haplotype

group and a known haplotype at the end of the respective
haplotype path or for internal nodes by an unknown haplotype when known haplotypes are absent. Finally, designations of elements corresponding to haplotypes can be
shown in place of haplotype designations (Figure 9).
Here, each element corresponds to a unique haplotype,
but in other sequence sets this is often not the case.
The straightforwardness of this algorithm ensures that
there is only one unambiguously constructed genealogical
tree for each sequence set analysed. Since the topology of
the tree is determined exclusively by relations of regular
marker sets directly deduced from the data, the tree construction is devoid of any topological assumptions set in
advance to the algorithm itself.

sets are completely included in its own set (Fig. 6), with
initial notification of groups with sets not included in any
other set.
8. Immediate inclusion list is formed by choosing for each
group only those groups from the previous list whose sets
are not included in any other group's smaller set (Fig. 7),
9. Groups with sets not included in any larger set on the
latter list are placed in direct connection with the root.
Growing of the tree is then continued along forking
chains of immediate inclusions to their ends. Each haplotype is then placed with the marker group with the smallest set containing the haplotype (Figure 8). Thus, each
node except the root is represented by a unique marker

Assessment of bootstrap support values for a SMCC tree
One of the most widely accepted tests for the degree of
confidence in classification of taxa into subtrees (monophyletic groups) on a given tree is the determination of
the bootstrap support value [22]. On a SMCC tree, one
can for each subtree precisely calculate the theoretical
bootstrap support value, namely the value which would
be obtained if the number of bootstrap replicates reached
infinity. A particular subtree appears in a bootstrap replicate here if at least one site corresponding to a marker
defining the root of the group is sampled. Suppose that
this node is defined by a marker group of g equivalent
markers placed at g different sites. Then, since formation
of a replicate is equivalent to m times sampling one site
out of m sites in total with replacement, the probability
that neither one of g sites would be taken in one drawing
is (m-g)/m. Further, the probability that neither one of g
sites would be taken in m consecutive drawings (necessary
for formation of one bootstrap replicate) is ((m-g)/m)m.
Conversely, the probability that at least one of g sites
would appear in a bootstrap replicate is BS = 1 - ((m-g)/
m)m, as Felsenstein [22] noted for the case of a compatible
data set. This latter probability represents in this way the
theoretical bootstrap support value (BS) for a given node.
The precise values for BS are given in the Table 1 for ranges
of values g from 1 to 5 and m from 10 to 100000.

As is evident from the presented table, a node generated
by a group of three or more equivalent markers receives a
significant BS value of over 95 % for the sequence length
of at least 100000 units.

Conclusion
In summary, a rooted SMCC tree has the following essential properties:
a) It is devoid of any topological assumption except for
strict requirement for a tree-like structure without reticulations,

Comments from Eugene V. Koonin:
An attempt to develop an "ultimate" phylogenetic algorithm free of (almost) any assumptions is laudable. However, this paper does not offer any evidence that the
algorithm would produce informative results on simulated or real-life data of any complexity (see the review by
Yuri Wolf). A thorough revision including a detailed comparison to other algorithms and assessment of performance on various classes of data could change things.

Author response: The main objective of the paper was to present
the underlying principles of the phylogenetic method in its algorithmic form and to point out its main features by analysis of
one well known experimental data set. The algorithm allows the
sequence data to form a unique result by their own, without any
inference from the analyst. So the informativeness of the result
is here determined by the nature and extent (sample size) of the
sequence data analysed, not by the algorithm itself. The algorithm guarantees accuracy, whereby informativeness inasmuch
it relates to the obtained tree resolution depends on the analysed
data and not on the algorithm itself, as explained in the Discussion section. So the algorithm cannot be compared with other
algorithms that by themselves produce "informativeness" without ensuring accuracy. Assessment of performance on various
classes of data is surely needed, but this task might be too extensive for a single paper. Of practical importance here is the fact
that the paper offers a tool for obtaining objective results, thus
widening the choice of methods available for phylogeneticists
without precluding use of any other method as an alternative,
if preferred by the investigator.

d) All hidden ancestors at internal nodes are shown, and
Comments from Yuri I. Wolf
e) Numbers of regular markers arising between each two
nodes are given at their links, so that one can calculate the
number of regular mutations occurring between any two
elements on the same path. Therefore the tree could be
regarded as a metric one.
Provided the sequence length is greater than a certain critical size, this method yields unique, consistent, fully
resolved and well supported genealogical tree for individuals, populations or species with further possibility of
determination of nature and positions of irregular mutations.

The paper by SV Stankov describes a compatibility-based
algorithm proclaimed to be the "ultimate solution" of the
phylogenetic inference problem. The algorithm involves
grouping of haplotypes (unique sequences) according to
shared phylogenetic markers (directed mutations,
inferred from the ancestral or outgroup sequence) and
removing the minimal set of markers that form homoplasies (incompatible group assignments). Mutually compatible groups are assembled into a hierarchical tree-like
structure on the strength of inclusion of lower-ranked sets
into the higher-ranked ones. The algorithm is free from

Besides, one should in principle accept the fact that in reality,
genealogy is indeed star-like. Any parent with more than two
children forms with them a star-like tree (or a star-like subtree).

and other compatibility methods, in particular those that
rely on finding cliques.

tree topology constraints and can produce multifurcations
and place extant sequences in internal tree nodes.
The full assessment of the algorithm novelty requires a
review by a "hardcore" phylogeneticists and cannot be
provided by this reviewer.
Author response: This paper surely needs to be viewed and
reviewed by "hardcore" phylogeneticists since it presents the
very "hardcore" of phylogenetics.
The paper does not contain any extensive analysis of the
robustness of the reconstructed phylogeny and comparison with existing methods. The reviewer is skeptical about
the practical usefulness of strict compatibility reconstruction as complex data would tend to produce star-like trees
(where all extant haplotypes are attached to a single ancestral node) due to extensive incompatibility between makers. The paper does not contain any evidence suggesting
otherwise.
Author response: Star-like or any other SMCC tree topology can
in no case result from incompatibility between markers, since
incompatible markers are removed in advance, hence they cannot influence the tree construction procedure in any way.

Author response: Relevant statements were already included in
the manuscript version presented to the reviewer. These are
"Besides the strategy of tree construction directly from the integrity of the (compatible) data at hand, the presented method differs from the classical compatibility methods in the creation of
groups of equivalent markers to simplify the analysis." (page 4,
line 48 – page 5, line 1) and "Since the topology of the tree is
determined exclusively by relations of regular marker sets
directly deduced from the data, the tree construction is devoid
of any topological assumptions set in advance to the algorithm
itself." (page 9, line 21 – 24).
However, for a specific comparison of the presented method
with clique analysis, I inserted a new sentence on page 5, lines
1–5 in the final version:
"While the accuracy of the SMCC tree in relation to the analysed data is ensured by the presented Potomak algorithm, a tree
resulting from clique analysis, even in case that the maximal
consensus clique is taken may not be true simply because of topological restrictions imposed by individual character state trees
used for formation of the final tree."
Reviewer comments:
I would be satisfied with the example showing how clique
method is failing to obtaining the same results on the
same T7 dataset, and discussion of the difference.
2. All sites in the T7 dataset are two-state sites. What about
three and four states – if method becomes more complicated or not applicable, say so.
Author response: Relevant remark is given on page 5, lines 2–
6: "Multiple markers at the same site must comprise mutually
disjoint haplotype sets because one haplotype can have only one
character state at one site. Consequently, a star phylogeny for
the respective character state tree is in principle assumed. However, eventual irregular markers at this site are subsequently
discarded."

Reviewer comments:
1. Legend to Figure 1: the numbers attached to the references do not match the numbers in the reference list.
Author response: The mistake was correctly noticed, so I made
the appropriate changes in the final version.
Reviewer comments:
2. In the background section, the emphasis seems to be on
three common constraints on the tree topology, which the
current method seeks to overcome. The conditions a. and
c., however, are not hard to drop – there are methods that
do not require them – and I am not sure what condition
b. is all about. But, anyway, it is unclear what the rest of
the paper has to do with all this. Only a. seems to be relevant to the data that are analyzed, viz. K being the parent
of L without such assumption or sister group of L with it,
and even this is discussed only as the shortcoming of the
method, not as significant difference. I am confused.
Author response: The incomplete branching resolution (resulting in K being the parent of L) observed in the given example
is not a shortcoming of the method itself, but a consequence of
insufficient sequence length analyzed (i.e. insufficient sample
size). "enough genetic markers for discerning each step in the
corresponding reproductive history of analysed elements must
be observed. Here, a relatively small segment of T7 genome
yielded 13 regular groups in total. One could expect that almost
certainly the above mentioned discrepancies would be solved
with the inclusion of additional genome segments in analysis.
However, it could have also been the case that throughout the
whole genome only these 13 groups were recorded. In that case
it would have been impossible to reveal the true reproductive
history by genetic analysis." (page 5, lines 24–31).
Reviewer comments:
Nonetheless, I do not see how the critique of generally
assumed a., b. and c. is germane to the paper.
3. Implementation details and complexity analysis of the
algorithm would be helpful. Please provide.
Author response: I intend to present implementation details and
complexity analysis of the algorithm as soon as the appropriate
program is technically perfected (which is currently not the
case), along with a free presentation of the program on a web
site.

Reviewer comments:
The the best of my knowledge (I am not a character compatibility expert) the approach that is presented is new,
the most interesting point being the development of an
algorithm that identifies a set of strictly mutationally compatibel mutations in a set of aligned sequence data, and
deriving of a tree from that. The latter is in contrast to
methods that"test" all possible trees for their compatibility with a set of sequences. Because the algorithm derives
the tree, it allows a less strict definition of what a tree
should look like, a less strict definition of course leads to
more possible trees, and makes explicit testing computationally harder.
Looming behind the article is of course the perennial
debate how strict one should be methodologically in
deriving trees for sequence data. This manuscript takes a
rather extreme viewpoint, not even adressing the debate
between heuristic distance/clustering approaches, some of
which do allow for multifurcating trees, and characterbased approaches, but even within the character-based
approaches selecting only a set of markers (positions) that
is strictly compatibel with itself. I will not address this discussion here, however I do think that describing including
characters that are to some extent homoplastic as adding
pure noise to a pure melody does not contribute anything
to the discussion. We all would like to use only the perfect,
non-homoplastic characters, but in practice we often have
little choice: there are just not enough of those.
My first main concern is whether the algorithm is of any
practical use to people who regularly make phylogenies
from sequence data. One example is shown in which the
algorithm is succesfully applied to an experimental phylogeny of T7 sequences that was constructed by Hillis et al.
That set of sequences has the advantage that the initial
state is know for all sequences. Generally we do not know
the initial state of sequences, even if an outgroup is available. Specifically in the sequencing of genomes from species for which we do not have fossil data, or in situations
where Horizontal Gene Transfer might have occurred it is
often not possible to obtain an outgroup.

The author argues against the usage of simulation data to
test his method, because then he might generate those
data that would fit his criteria. I would still like to see the
method tested on a larger set of sequence data from "real
life": e.g. take a set of (aligned) ribosomal RNA sequences,
e.g. 50 from the bacteria, and run the method: how many
positions are useful?
My second main concern is the following: The algorithm
is presented as non-parametric: it chooses the largest set of
compatibel mutations, or, at least, it removes the minimal
combination of markers that when removed, leave all the
other positions compatibel with each other. But what if
the dataset contains multiple compatible sets that are
(almost) equally large? Furthermore, is the algorithm
guaranteed to find the largest compatible set? The second
concern actually is related to my wish to see the algorithm
tested on a set of biological sequences, to have an example
of how many positions there are in the compatibility consensus.
I guess the culprit lies in the remark that "Provided the
sequence length is greater than a critical size the method
yields unique, consistent, fully resolved and well supported genealogical tree(s, ed.) for individuals" A calculation about the "Dependence of resolution on the sample
size taken" gives theoretical values of the required
sequence length for a certain set of sequences. Again, how
do those numbers play out for biological sequences?

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/1/1/5

I think the paper is of importance in its field, provided the
algorithm is shown to be of partical use: i.e. applying it on
a reasonably large set of biological sequences there are
enough positions in the compatibility consensus set to
obtain a phylogeny.
I have no competing interests regarding the publication of
this paper.

Technical comment

Additional File 3

Homology, as detected by current day, profile-based
methods, does not require identity of a substantial proportion characters across all taxa.
In general the method is well described. The author puts
the emphasis on the fact that he has a less constrained tree
than do other methods, aside from the remark that e.g. a
method like Tree Puzzling does also not produce fully
resolved trees, I was most intrigued by the algorithm that
is used to get at the compatible set of characters, and
derive the tree from that.
Summarizing:
I would like to see a major revision that basically
addresses the questions above regarding practical usability and the issue of how the algorithm deals with multiple,
(almost) equally large sets of compatible markers in the
aligned sequences.
