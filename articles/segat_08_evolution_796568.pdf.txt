Abstract
Background: Hepcidin/LEAP-1 is an iron regulatory hormone originally identified as an
antimicrobial peptide. As part of a systematic analysis of the evolution of host defense peptides in
primates, we have sequenced the orthologous gene from 14 species of non-human primates.
Results: The sequence of the mature peptide is highly conserved amongst all the analyzed species,
being identical to the human one in great apes and gibbons, with a single residue conservative
variation in Old-World monkeys and with few substitutions in New-World monkeys.
Conclusion: Our analysis indicates that hepcidin's role as a regulatory hormone, which involves
interaction with a conserved receptor (ferroportin), may result in conservation over most of its
sequence, with the exception of the stretch between residues 15 and 18, which in New-World
monkeys (as well as in other mammals) shows a significant variation, possibly indicating that this
structural region is involved in other functions.

Background
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are phylogenetically
ancient and ubiquitous molecules that play an essential
role in many aspects of host defence [1]. In plants and
invertebrate animals they are central to protecting the host
from infection, while in vertebrate animals that have
developed an acquired immunity they not only provide a
rapidly mobilised first line of defence as part of the innate
immune system, but also act as signalling molecules to
cellular components of both innate and adaptive immunity [2]. Being at the interface between host and commensal or pathogenic microbes, they generally undergo an
accelerated evolution, which has resulted in many differ-

ent AMP families and a remarkable sequence variation
even within structural groups [3].
In some cases, molecules derived from AMPs have
acquired functions beyond host defence, although they
can maintain a role in the prevention of infection. The
recently identified peptide hepcidin/LEAP-1 is a good
example. It was independently isolated from human urine
and plasma ultra filtrate, respectively, by two groups
searching for novel AMPs. Both denominations thus
reflect its hepatic expression (hep- or Liver Expressed) and
its antimicrobial activity in vitro (-cidin, or Antimicrobial
Peptide) [4,5]. Subsequently, the observation that disruption or mutation of the hepcidin gene in mouse and man

results in severe forms of iron overload identified it also as
a negative regulator of iron absorption, recycling and
release from stores [6-8]. It functions by inducing the
internalisation of the ubiquitous, vertebrate, iron export
membrane protein ferroportin, at the major sites of iron
flow (enterocytes, tissue macrophages and hepatocytes),
causing a decrease in serum iron levels. It was thus proposed that hepcidin was the long sought iron regulatory
hormone, whose synthesis is controlled by iron levels and
erythroid demands [9,10]. Hepcidin maintains a role in
host defence by acting as a bridge between immunity and
iron-metabolism, as indicated by the fact that it is markedly induced by infection and inflammation [7,8,11].
This likely reflects an antimicrobial action via iron limitation rather than a direct antimicrobial activity [12,13].

pared it with the human one (HSS), so as to gain information about its evolution in primates and determine
whether it could usefully contribute to their phylogenetic
analysis. This study was carried out in the context of a
broader analysis of primate host defense peptide evolution, which has included the cathelicidin LL-37 and betadefensins, and which has shown remarkably varied patterns of molecular evolution, ranging from conservation
to positive selection for variation [15,16]. By investigating
the degree of variation of the hepcidins in the closely
related primate species we aimed to determine the extent
of purifying selection during the evolution of this gene in
primates and locate regions of variation that could provide useful information on the functional determinants of
this multifunctional peptide hormone.

In humans, hepcidin is encoded by three small exons in
the HAMP gene (19q13.1), and translates to an 84aa prepropeptide presenting a furin cleavage site. It is expressed
and processed predominantly in liver for plasma delivery,
and it is excreted by the kidney. In urine, the predominant
form is of 25 amino acids (hep-25) with a charge of +2,
but two shorter, inactive peptides (hep-22 and hep-20)
were also detected [4]. It does not show significant
sequence similarity to any other known AMP, but it has
been associated with the defensin family of host defence
peptides due to its salt-sensitive antimicrobial activity in
vitro, cationic and amphipathic nature, and the presence
of 4 disulfide bridges in its tertiary structure. However,
unlike defensins, it assumes a hairpin conformation
which is stabilised by four S-S bridges placed in a ladderlike manner, including an unusual and possibly reactive
vicinal disulphide. Structurally, it is therefore more reminiscent of AMPs such as protegrin [8]. It is not clear
whether the observed in vivo antimicrobial activity is biologically relevant, is simply a residue of a possible evolutionary origin as an AMP, or derives from the conserved
structural characteristics imposed by its function as an
iron-regulating hormone.

Results

Hepcidin homologues and putative hepcidin precursors
have been identified in several vertebrate animals, ranging
from mammals and birds to amphibians and fish
[11,13,14]. Homology amongst the mature peptide
sequences is quite high, reflecting a high degree of structural conservation and pointing to a role as iron regulatory hormones also in non-mammalian animals. Some
species however express more than one hepdicin gene,
whose products may have functions other than iron regulation, and in fish they may indeed still act as AMPs
[11,13]. It has in fact been hypothesised that the iron-regulatory hormones have evolved from ancient fish AMPs.

The HAMP gene nucleotide sequences obtained from the
analyzed primate species, and the deduced corresponding
amino acid sequences, are reported in Figures 1 and 2.
They clearly demonstrate a high identity to the human
sequence at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels.
The nucleotide identity for the entire coding and untranslated (UTR) regions ranges from 99.7% with chimpanzee
(PTR) to 92.6% with the NWM Ateles fusciceps (AFU). An
in-frame insertion of three nucleotides (namely GGA,
leading to the insertion of a glycine between residue 38
and 39 of the pre-propeptide) occurs in Hylobates.
At the amino acid level, identity ranges from 98.8% in
chimpanzee (PTR) to 83.3% in NWM Ateles (AFU) (see
Table 1).
The HAMP gene coding sequences were then used to compute an UPGMA tree with all primate sequences, using the
Canis lupus familiaris HAMP gene as the outgroup [17]
(Figure 3), which reflects the expected phylogenetic relationship both among families and between families. A
maximum-likelihood approach, using the PAML suite of
programs, was then used to determine if positive selection
acted on the primate HAMP genes, and globally found
that it has not (ω<1). However, a site-analysis found that
individual amino acid residues may be under positive
selection (ω>1), including the Gly insertion between residue 38 and 39, and Phe39Gln and Gln40Leu substitutions in the Hylobates sequences (see Figure 2), and the
His74Arg, Arg75Gln and Ser76Pro substitution specific to
the NWM sequences. A subsequent branch-analysis also
indicated that although the mean ω is <1 over the entire
tree, positive selection may act on the Hylobates and NWM
branches, confirming the site-analysis data.

Discussion
We have sequenced the hepcidin gene coding region (all
three exons) in 14 non-human primate species and com-

level in the different primates species could have func-

tional implications, these were analyzed in relation to the
available data for the structure and activity of the human
hepcidin, dividing the amino acid sequence into three
parts, namely signal peptide, pro-region and mature peptide region (see Figure 2).
The entire sequence is quite conserved, but more so at the
level of the mature peptide. In effect, the only significant
variation in the pro-region corresponds to the insertion
observed for the Hylobates species, whose effect is unpredictable as it falls outside the mature peptide. The putative
mature peptide sequence is identical to the human one in
great apes and gibbons, and shows a single conservative
Lys83Arg variation in Old-World monkeys. Interestingly,
a heterozygous Lys83Arg replacement leading to a peptide
identical to that of the OWMs has been found in a patient
with porphyria cutanea tarda and iron overload, but testing of the synthetic homologue revealed it to remain fully
functional in iron regulation, so the effective role of this
substitution is not yet clear [18]. Other mutations in the
hepcidin gene previously reported to be associated with
hemochromatosis in humans [19-21] were not found in

the primate species examined (at least 5 individuals per
species have been studied).
The pro-peptide convertase cleavage site, the functionally
essential N-terminal region [18] and residues Phe4, Pro5,
Phe9, and Met21 that are involved in the oligomerization
of hepcidin-25 [22] are all conserved, as well as all
cysteine residues that account for the formation of disulphide bond and confer hepcidin's characteristic structure.
Only the New-World monkeys show significant variation
in a stretch between residues 15 and 18 of the mature peptide sequence (74His, 75Arg and 76Ser, using the full propeptide sequence numbering) (see figure 3) which may be
under positive selection. Alignment of the primate
sequences with those of other mammals, as well as bird,
amphibian and fish sequences [11,13,14], indicate that
this region is in fact the most variable also with respect to
other mammalian sequences (see figure 4a). This stretch
is just C-terminal to the two Cys residues forming the vicinal disulphide at the peptide's hairpin turn (see figure
4b) [22], which may be functionally significant. While the
conserved N-terminal region is recognised to be essential

for interaction with ferroportin [18], the role of the C-terminal side is not well defined.
Shi et al [13] have hypothesized that, during vertebrate
evolution, hepcidin differentiated its functions towards
an iron-regulatory hormone starting from a more ancient
peptide characterized by antimicrobial activity. In this
respect, it is interesting to note that substitutions in the
variable region, concerning both primates and other animals, often concerns charged residues (see Figure 4);
moreover, it has been shown for different types of AMPs
that variation in charge are also favoured by positive selection [15,23]. Whereas for the latter peptides, charge modulation can be directly related to the efficiency of
interaction with microbes, thus affecting antimicrobial
activity, in the case of hepcidin, the effect of this variation
on function/s is an open question.

Conclusion
Our results indicate that hepcidin is quite conserved in all
primate species. This may derive from the fact that its role
as an iron regulating hormone requires interaction with
the conserved vertebrate iron transporter ferroportin [24].

In this context, while some types of residue variations,
such as those observed in mouse hepcidin 2 [13], can
result in a loss of the iron regulatory role, other variations,
such as those observed in the stretch between residues 15
and 18 in NWM and other mammals, can more freely
occur without apparently disrupting the hormonal function. It remains to be established whether these residues
are involved in other possible functions of the hepcidin
peptides, consistent with the possibility that they evolved
under positive selection.

We tried to minimize this risk of nucleotide intra-specific
variations, by analyzing more than one individual for
each species and determining a consensus sequence. This
method allowed us to clear our data for single nucleotide
polymorphisms variations in most species.

tissues of primates as described previously by Del Pero et

dNTPs and variant concentration of MgCl2 (from 1.5 to 3
mM). The amplification conditions were 30 sec at 95°C,
30 sec at variable annealing temperature between the different templates (from 52°C up to 60°C), 30 sec at 72°C
for 35 cycles. PCR products were observed, under UV
light, in a 2% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide.
DNA sequencing of PCR products was performed using
the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction
Kit v. 2.0 (Applied Biosystems). DNA sequences were
detected and analyzed on an automated ABI Prism 3100
Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems).
Sequence alignment and Data Analysis
Multiple alignment of the nucleotide and amino acid
sequences were performed using the program CLUSTAL
W [27].

A phylogenetic tree was obtained by the UPGMA method,
using the PHYLIP software package [28]. Maximum Likelihood analysis was performed with the PAML software
package [29] by comparing the log-likelihood ratios of the
data using different NS-sites models [30]. This type of
analysis is able to identify amino acid residues with high
posterior probabilities (greater than 0.95) of having
evolved under positive selection. ω ratios for the tree were
calculated using different models (free ratio, two- and
three ratio) [31].
