Abstract
Background: Burkholderia thailandensis is a non-pathogenic environmental saprophyte closely related to
Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative agent of the often fatal animal and human disease melioidosis. To study
B. thailandensis genomic variation, we profiled 50 isolates using a pan-genome microarray comprising genomic
elements from 28 Burkholderia strains and species.
Results: Of 39 genomic regions variably present across the B. thailandensis strains, 13 regions corresponded to
known genomic islands, while 26 regions were novel. Variant B. thailandensis isolates exhibited isolated acquisition
of a capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis gene cluster (B. pseudomallei-like capsular polysaccharide) closely
resembling a similar cluster in B. pseudomallei that is essential for virulence in mammals; presence of this cluster
was confirmed by whole genome sequencing of a representative variant strain (B. thailandensis E555). Both wholegenome microarray and multi-locus sequence typing analysis revealed that the variant strains formed part of a
phylogenetic subgroup distinct from the ancestral B. thailandensis population and were associated with atypical
isolation sources when compared to the majority of previously described B. thailandensis strains. In functional
assays, B. thailandensis E555 exhibited several B. pseudomallei-like phenotypes, including colony wrinkling, resistance
to human complement binding, and intracellular macrophage survival. However, in murine infection assays,
B. thailandensis E555 did not exhibit enhanced virulence relative to other B. thailandensis strains, suggesting that
additional factors are required to successfully colonize and infect mammals.
Conclusions: The discovery of such novel variant strains demonstrates how unbiased genomic surveys of nonpathogenic isolates can reveal insights into the development and emergence of new pathogenic species.

Background
The evolution of pathogen virulence is a complex process involving macrogenomic processes, such as largescale gene acquisition and loss, combined with more
subtle modifications of existing genes and regulatory
pathways. Previous studies have shown that microbial
pathogens can employ a variety of molecular factors to
enable human and animal infection, such as type III
toxin secretion systems, adhesins, and modulators of

host signaling pathways [1-4]. As the compendium of
virulence factors increases alongside the growing numbers of sequenced pathogen genomes [5], important
evolutionary questions that arise include understanding
how non-pathogenic species originally acquired these
virulence components, investigating relationships
between these virulence components to determine if
their sequence of acquisition is stochastic or stereotypic,
and identifying specific ecological forces in the host or
environment leading to virulence gene propagation and
maintenance in natural bacterial populations.

The closely related Gram-negative microbes Burkholderia pseudomallei (Bp) and B. thailandensis (Bt) represent a useful comparative system for studying the
intricacies of pathogen evolution. While both species
can be isolated from soil, Bp is the causative agent of
melioidosis, a serious infectious disease of humans and
animals with an overall fatality rate of 50% in northeast
Thailand and 20% in Northern Australia [6], while Bt is
generally considered non-pathogenic to mammals
[7-10]. Traditional methods for distinguishing Bt from
other Burkholderia species (including Bp) include differences in colony morphologies, arabinose assimilation,
latex agglutination and immunoflourescence assays
using monoclonal exopolysaccharide antibodies, along
with PCR detection of arabinose or type III secretion
genes and 16 s rRNA sequencing [11-22]. Previous genome comparisons have revealed several genetic differences between Bp and Bt, some of which are likely
required for Bp to colonize and infect mammals [23,24].
These include the gain of a Bp-specific capsular polysaccharide gene cluster [25], the loss of an arabinose assimilation operon [26], the gain of a phosphonate utilization
operon [24], the gain of a Yersinia-like fimbriae cluster
[24], and fine scale genetic modifications in certain virulence genes, most notably those related to type III secretion [24,27]. Amongst these factors, it is unclear as to
the timescale of acquisition and which are most important in precipitating mammalian virulence. Answering
this question is particularly challenging due to uncertainties concerning which ecological conditions in the
environment might have favored acquisition of particular virulence factors.
In this study, we hypothesized that due to its intrinsic
multi-factorial nature, it is likely that virulence and nonvirulence is not a black and white issue and that natural
bacterial populations should contain different shades of
grey corresponding to intermediate states of pathogenic
potential. Moreover, we reasoned that the identification
and genetic characterization of such variants, combined
with relevant ecological data, should present a promising
approach to addressing questions relating to the emergence of new virulent forms. To test this idea, we used
a novel Burkholderia pan-genome array covering 28
publicly available Burkholderia genome sequences to
profile a panel of natural Bt isolates. Remarkably, we
discovered the existence of variant Bt strains exhibiting
isolated acquisition of a capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis gene cluster (Bp-likeCPS) displaying features
highly similar to a comparable gene cluster in Bp known
to be essential for mammalian virulence [25,28-32]. Subsequent experimental, phylogenetic and genomic analyses revealed that these variant strains exhibit several
functional and molecular features that are distinct from
previously described Bt strains, and may represent a

significant early transition towards a new virulent form.
Our ability to uncover these novel variant strains
demonstrates the benefit of analysis of non-pathogenic
strains related to a particular pathogen of interest, and
how discovery of rare variant isolates possessing subsets
of virulence-related molecular features may prove useful
for studying early events in pathogen evolution.

Results
Design and validation of a Burkholderia pan-genome
array

We designed a Burkholderia pan-genome array (BPGA)
containing genomic elements from 28 Burkholderia genomes (Additional file 1). Using a custom species-specific
analysis pipeline, we identified regions of novel genetic
sequence from strains belonging to each species, and
concatenated these novel regions to the species reference genomes (K96423 for Bp and E264 for Bt; Additional file 2). On average, we identified 0.15 Mb of novel
genetic sequence for every new Bp strain, and 0.31 Mb
of novel sequence for every new Bt strain. No appreciable decrease in the rate of discovery was observed with
the successive addition of strains (Additional file 1), suggesting that the Bp and Bt genomes are ‘open’. The
composition of the BPGA was confirmed to be independent of strain order (Additional file 3). In addition to Bp
and Bt, we also incorporated genes found in Burkholderia cenocepacia (Bc strain J2315) [33] but not Bp
K96243. The final 22.3 Mb BPGA contained genomic
sequences from 23 Bp strains (12.34 Mb), 4 Bt strains
(7.35 Mb), including complete genome sequences of the
Bp K96243 and Bt E264 reference genomes, and 3,019
additional Bc J2315 genes (2.64 Mb). Experimental validation of the BPGA was achieved by performing a series
of array-based comparative genomic hybridization
(aCGH) experiments, hybridizing to the BPGA genomic
DNAs from strains of known genome sequence, and
considering the array results against independent in
silico predictions (Additional files 4 and 5). These
experiments confirmed the ability of the BPGA to
rapidly identify genomic regions of species- and strainspecificity in a single hybridization experiment.
Genomic variation in the B. thailandensis genome

Numerous studies have analyzed genomic variation in
Bp [34,35], but similar genome-wide comparisons have
not been reported for Bt. Using the BPGA, we performed aCGH on 50 Bt strains isolated from Thailand,
Cambodia, and the USA. All isolates were confirmed to
be Bt by multiple independent molecular analyses,
including multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), 16 S
rRNA analysis, and the presence of arabinose assimilation genes (Additional file 6). When analyzed on the
BPGA, the Bt strains exhibited several regions of

Sim et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R89
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/8/R89

genomic difference compared to the BtE264 reference
genome (see Figure 1a for representative strains). Many
of these regions corresponded to previously identified
‘genomic islands’ (GIs) in BtE264 (green bars in Figure
1a), referring to chromosomal regions frequently associated with horizontal gene transfer and exhibiting unusual sequence features, such as atypical codon bias or
GC content, or the presence of multiple prophage and
transposon-related genes [24]. We also discovered several previously unreported smaller regions of difference
across the strains, referred to as ‘novel genomic islets’
(nGis; red bars in Figure 1a).
Pairwise comparisons of the Bt isolates against the
BtE264 reference revealed that each individual strain differed from BtE264 by approximately 3 to 5% of genomic
content (mean = 3.4%), collectively representing 8% of
the BtE264 genome (Additional file 7). We focused our
analysis on regions exhibiting recurrent genomic variation, defined as a region exhibiting variability in at least
10% of strains. In total, we identified 39 recurrent
regions of variability (Figure 1b, blue bars). Confirming
previous reports that the GIs are highly mobile across
different Bt strains, 13 regions corresponded to known
GIs [24]. Interestingly, the exact genomic boundaries of
the GIs were often found to differ slightly depending on
either computational or microarray analysis. For example, the boundaries of four GIs (1, 4, 9, and 13) were
discovered to be variably larger (ranging from 200 bp to
2 kb) compared to previous in silico analysis (Additional
file 8 provides a complete list of all GIs). Because aCGH
provides a direct experimental measure of regional
variability in strains, these aCGH boundaries are likely
more precise and thus complement and refine in silico
analyses of bacterial genome plasticity.
Besides previously annotated GIs [24], we also discovered 26 recurrent nGis, ranging from 258 bp to 8.5 kb
(median nGi size = 1.4 kb). Supporting the notion that
many of these nGis are also likely to represent mobile
elements, 17 of the 26 nGis exhibited several features of
horizontal elements, such as insertion elements, transposases, and prophage genes, atypical GC base composition, or were located proximal to transfer RNA genes,
which can function as integration hot-spots (Figure 1b)
[34]. These results demonstrate that Bt genome variability between strains is not simply confined to the computationally predicted GIs, and provide a more accurate
assessment of the portion of the Bt genome that is variably present across strains (the Bt accessory genome).
Variant Bt strains exhibiting acquisition of a Bp-like
capsular polysaccharide gene cluster

A specific region on Bt chromosome 1 (BTH_I13241343) encodes an exopolysaccharide (EPS) gene cluster
(purple arrows in Figure 1) that in Bp has been replaced

Page 3 of 17

by a capsular polysaccharide gene cluster (Bp CPS)
known to be essential for mammalian virulence
[25,28-32]. The Bt EPS cluster was present in almost all
of the profiled Bt strains; however, two isolates (BtE555
and BtCDC3015869) exhibited decreased fluorescence
ratios in the Bt EPS region, suggesting absence of the Bt
EPS cluster in these strains (Figures 1a and 2a). Hypothesizing that the genomic loss of Bt EPS in these strains
might have been associated with the concomitant gain of
novel genetic material, we surveyed hybridization signals
for both BtE555 and BtCDC3015869 in the Bp-associated
region of the BPGA. Both strains exhibited enhanced
hybridization signals in Bp microarray probes representing Bp CPS genes (BPSL2787-2810) (Figure 2a), which
was not observed for the other Bt strains. These results
suggest that BtE555 and BtCDC3015869 may represent
variant Bt strains that have acquired genomic material
highly similar to Bp CPS genes. Moreover, the observation that two distinct Bt strains have gained this material
suggests that this acquisition may be a recurrent event.
To validate the aCGH results, we performed a series
of PCR amplification reactions using oligonucleotide primers designed against six Bp CPS genes (BPSL2791 to
BPSL2797). All six PCR reactions successfully amplified
PCR products from BpK96243 (positive control), BtE555
and BtCDC3015869, but not from the BtE264 reference
strain (Figure 2b). Subsequent DNA sequencing of the
PCR products from BtE555 and BtCDC3015869 confirmed nucleotide similarities of ≥92% to the Bp CPS
genes of BpK96243 (Additional file 9). To reflect the
similarity of these genes in BtE555 and BtCDC3015869
to Bp CPS, we will henceforth refer to this novel region
as a ‘Bp-likeCPS’ cluster.
We identified the genomic boundaries of the Bt EPS/
Bp-likeCPS exchange to occur at BTH_I1324 and
BTH_I1343 (Figure 2a). To explore the evolutionary
sequence of this genomic replacement event, we benchmarked patterns of nucleotide composition within the
Bp-likeCPS cluster against the general Bt chromosome
as a background model. Genes in the Bp-likeCPS cluster
exhibited a markedly lower G+C content (59.2%) compared to the G+C content of the general Bt chromosome (67.3% in Bt chromosome 1 versus 65.5% in the
Bt EPS), consistent with the Bp-likeCPS cluster being a
foreign element recently acquired through horizontal
gene transfer (Additional file 10). In contrast, genes in
the Bt EPS cluster (BTH_I1328 to BTH_I1337), found
in the majority of Bt strains, exhibited an average G+C
highly similar to the general Bt chromosome, suggesting
that this represents the ancestral genomic state. These
results suggest that the variant Bt strains have acquired
the Bp-likeCPS gene cluster, and that isolates containing
Bt EPS, constituting the majority of previously described
Bt strains, likely represent an ancestor population.

Functional expression of Bp-likeCPS in variant Bt strains

To assess if the Bp-likeCPS cluster might be functionally
expressed in the variant Bt strains, we performed immunoblotting analysis on a panel of Bp and Bt protein
extracts using anti-Bp CPS antibodies [36]. Immunoreactive bands of approximately 200 kDa corresponding
to Bp CPS were observed in BpK96243 positive control
strains, BtE555 and BtCDC3015869 (the two variant
strains), but not in BtE264 negative controls (Figure 2c).
Expression of Bp-likeCPS at the surface of BtE555 and
BtCDC3015869 bacteria was further confirmed by
immunofluorescence imaging (Figure 2d). These data
indicate that the Bp-likeCPS cluster is expressed in the
variant Bt strains, and with sufficient conformational
similarity to cross-react with antibodies directed towards
Bp CPS.
Genome sequencing of BtE555 confirms the presence of
the Bp-likeCPS cluster

The discovery of these variant Bt strains motivated us to
perform whole-genome sequencing for a representative
isolate (BtE555). Using paired-end deep sequencing (see
Materials and methods), we generated >2.5 Gb of mappable BtE555 genomic sequence. Mapping of the BtE555
reads to the BtE264 reference genome revealed that
approximately 90% of the BtE264 genome was covered
by a minimum of 20 independent reads (that is, 20× coverage, our threshold for calling SNPs, with an overall
mean genomic coverage of 170× (Figure 3a). Comparing
regions conserved between both strains, we identified
>29,000 SNPs between the BtE555 and BtE264 genomes.
Targeted Sanger re-sequencing of 50 randomly selected
SNPs yielded a false positive rate of <4%, confirming the
accuracy of the identified SNPs (Additional file 11).
Approximately 80% of the SNPs (23,767 SNPs) occurred
in genes, yielding an overall intragenic nucleotide diversity between BtE264 and BtE555 of approximately 4.0
SNP per kilobase. Interestingly, this value is elevated relative to the average intragenic nucleotide diversity
between different Bp strains (approximately 2.0 SNPs per
kilobase) [37]. Close to two-thirds of the intragenic SNPs
were synonymous, consistent with an overall strong
selection pressure to globally conserve protein sequence
and function (P < 2.2 × 10-16, binomial test) [38]. When
mapped across various functional pathways (COG categories), genes containing non-synomynous SNPs (SNPs
predicted to alter protein sequence) were found to be significantly enriched in pathways related to carbohydrate
metabolism, inorganic ion transport, and secondary
metabolism (P < 0.01 relative to all Bt genes, after multiple hypothesis Bonferroni correction) (Figure 3b).
The majority (64%) of BtE264 genomic regions exhibiting low coverage (< 20×) of BtE555 sequence reads
were associated with variable genomic elements such as

Page 6 of 17

GIs, nGis, or regions with repetitive sequence, which
can pose difficulties in mapping (Figure 3c). For example, we observed low coverage of the Bt EPS cluster
region in BtE264, confirming the absence of this region
in the BtE555 genome (Figure 3c). To identify genetic
elements specifically present in BtE555 but not BtE264,
we then performed de novo assembly of the BtE555
sequence reads and assembled 521 sequence contigs
with a median (N50) size of approximately 20 kb (Additional file 12). Filtering of these contigs against the
BtE264 genome identified approximately 300 kb of
BtE555-specific sequence, and several of the de novo
assembled contigs could be specifically assigned to particular low coverage regions in BtE264, such as GIs and
nGis (approximately 51% of all low coverage regions;
Additional file 13). For example, contig 19 (34 kb) was
found to map across the Bt EPS cluster and to contain
the Bp-likeCPS cluster (Figure 3d). A comparison of the
Bp-likeCPS cluster against the BpK96243 CPS cluster
(BPSL2787-BPSL2810) revealed an overall nucleotide
similarity of 94.4% (96% protein similarity). Besides the
Bp-likeCPS cluster, other notable genes found in BtE555
but not in BtE264 included a taurine metabolism gene
cluster, and various lipocalins, which are also found in
other Gram-negative bacteria like Vibrio cholera (Additional file 14).
Variant Bt strains expressing Bp-likeCPS behave as part of
a distinct phylogenetic subgroup

To define patterns of genetic relatedness between the
variant Bt strains and the general Bt population, we performed phylogenetic analyses where relationships
between the strains were inferred either by whole-genome aCGH data or MLST. Using unsupervised clustering, we grouped the Bt strains to one another based on
their overall patterns of genomic similarity computed
from the aCGH data, and obtained an unrooted aCGH
tree with six distinct clusters (Figure 4a). The robustness
of the aCGH clusters was confirmed by perturbing the
microarray data and computing kappa coefficients for
each cluster (see Materials and methods). A significant
degree of consistency between the original aCGH clusters and clusters obtained after data perturbation was
obtained ( for all clusters ranged from 0.94 to 1, P <
0.01; Additional file 15). Notably, while five of the six
clusters were roughly equidistant to one another in
terms of relatedness, one cluster (cluster 1) behaved as a
distant outlier group. Cluster 1 contains three Bt strains,
of which two are Bp-likeCPS-expressing isolates
(BtE555, BtCDC3015869), and BtCDC2721121. Besides
Bt EPS, other genes absent in all three cluster 1 strains
compared to BtE264 included various recombination
related genes, permeases, and DNA binding proteins
(Additional file 16). These aCGH clustering findings

Figure 4 Phylogenetic analysis based on aCGH and MLST. (a) aCGH clustering of Bt isolates. Clusters were based on whole-genome
microarray data. Six distinct clusters are observed, with cluster 1 containing both Bp-likeCPS-expressing strains. Strains are color-coded by the
sequence types (STs), also shown in brackets. (b) MLST network reconstruction of Bt genotypes. MLST clustering was performed on 21 STs, 18 of
which are shared with the aCGH data. 18 genotypes are represented by a highly reticulate network at the left of the figure, while three
genotypes (ST73, ST101 and ST696) segregate as a distinct phylogenetic clade.

suggest that the variant Bt strains appear to form part of
a distinct phylogenetic subgroup that is separate from
other Bt strains.
To further support the whole-genome phylogeny, we
repeated the phylogenetic analysis using MLST data
based on the concatenated sequences of seven housekeeping loci [39]. In addition to the 17 sequence types
(STs) associated with the 50 strains profiled by aCGH,
we also included MLST data for an additional 42 Bt
strains (Additional file 17). Collectively, the 92 Bt
strains were resolved into 21 STs. Comparisons of phylogenetic trees generated using aCGH or MLST data
revealed an overall concordance of 47%, with strain
pairs displaying high aCGH similarities also exhibiting
low MLST locus variance rates (Additional file 18).
These results are consistent with previous studies
demonstrating a significant degree of consistency

between strain clusters established by aCGH and MLST
[35,40,41]. Network reconstruction of the 21 ST genotypes revealed that a group of five Bt isolates, including
the two variant Bp-likeCPS-expressing Bt strains
(BtE555 (ST696), BtCDC3015869 (ST101)) and three
other strains (BtCDC2721121 (ST101), Bt1992/2572
(ST73) and Bt82172 (ST73)), segregated as a phylogenetic clade distinct from a second clade containing the
remaining Bt isolates, including all 83 isolates characterized from Thailand to date (Figure 4b). Similar results
were obtained in a rooted tree analysis using a Bp ST
(ST70) as an out-group (Additional file 19). Thus, using
both aCGH and MLST data, there appears to exist a
distinct subgroup of Bt isolates (STs 696, 101 and 73)
that are genetically distinct from the majority of previously described Bt isolates, and this subgroup contains
both Bp-likeCPS-expressing strains.

Correlation of the strain clusters to ecologic data
revealed that a common theme unifying the Bt strains
in the outlier subgroup was that they were all isolated
from atypical geographical and isolation sources, compared to the majority of Bt strains, which were recovered in Thailand and Australia. Specifically, BtE555
was isolated in Cambodia, BtCDC3015869 and
BtCDC2721121 in the USA, Bt1992/2572 in Kenya,
and Bt82172 in France. In addition to these geographic
differences, three of the outlier Bt strains were isolated
from not soil, the typical Bt reservoir, but from mammalian hosts - BtCDC3015869 and BtCDC2721121
were isolated from human patients associated with
clinical infection [42], and Bt82172 was isolated from
the intestines of a horse (see Discussion). These observations suggest that Bt strains in the outlier subgroup
may have an altered ability to survive in different
environments and may occupy separate niches compared to previously described Bt strains.
Bp-likeCPS-expressing Bt strains exhibit several Bpassociated phenotypes

The isolated gain of the Bp-likeCPS cluster in BtE555
provided us with the opportunity to test the sufficiency
of Bp-likeCPS in contributing to various Bp-associated
phenotypes. To facilitate comparisons in an isogenic
strain background, we created genetic mutants of
BtE555 CPS knockout (KO) where the Bp-likeCPS cluster was disrupted by the insertional mutagenesis of a
targeting vector into the wcbB gene (see Materials and
methods). Immunofluorescence studies confirmed that
the CPS KO exhibited severely attenuated to absent BplikeCPS expression (Figure 5a). In growth experiments,
the CPS KO strains exhibited slightly slower in vitro
growth rates than BtE555, although these differences
were marginal (Additional file 20).
Our previous survey of Bp isolates has shown that the
predominant colony morphology (morphotype) of Bp is
‘wrinkled’, with wrinkled colonies being observed for
approximately 75% of naturally occurring isolates [43].
In contrast, Bt colonies are typically round and smooth
(Figure 5b). When cultured on Ashdown medium,
BtE555 colonies exhibited a mixture of ‘smooth’ and
‘wrinkled’ colony morphologies, while CPS KO colonies
developed as round colonies with no wrinkling (Figure
5b). This result suggests that Bp-likeCPS expression
may contribute to the ‘wrinkled’ colony morphotypes of
the Bt variant strains, a phenotype similar to that
observed in the majority of Bp strains.
We then considered two mechanisms by which BplikeCPS might contribute to virulence - host immune
evasion and intracellular survival. First, Bp-likeCPS
might enhance virulence in organisms with an active
immune system by blocking deposition of host immune

Page 9 of 17

factors such as complement on pathogen surfaces,
thereby inhibiting detection by innate immunity pathways. In a complement deposition assay, BtE264 incubated with human serum exhibited significant binding
of C3b complement on microbial surfaces (Figure 5c),
indicating that Bt EPS is not capable of blocking complement deposition. In contrast, no C3b binding was
observed in wild-type BtE555, while CPS KO strains
exhibited C3b binding comparable to BtE264 (Figure
5c). These results suggest that Bp-likeCPS expression in
the variant strain is sufficient to block binding of host
complement proteins to microbial surfaces, thereby linking Bp-likeCPS to a possible virulence trait.
Second, Bp-likeCPS may also contribute to virulence
by facilitating intracellular survival and replication.
Using macrophage infection assays, we tested the ability
of BtE555 cells to survive in an intracellular host environment. Wild-type BtE555 exhibited an almost ninefold increase in their ability to survive and replicate in
RAW macrophage cells compared to isogenic CPS KO
strains (P = 0.002), indicating that the Bp-likeCPS is
required for survival in an intracellular environment
(Figure 5d). BtE555 also exhibited a significantly
enhanced ability to survive in RAW macrophages compared to BtE264 (P = 0.049). It is worth noting, however, that the absolute difference between BtE555 and
BtE264 is surprisingly modest.
Bp-likeCPS acquisition is not sufficient to enhance
virulence relative to other Bt strains

To directly test the in vivo virulence potential of BtE555,
we conducted animal infection experiments. We used
two established models: a murine intra-nasal assay and a
Caenorhabditis elegans co-culture assay [44,45]. We
infected BALB/c mice, which are highly sensitive to Bp
infection, to increasing intranasal doses of Bp
(BpK96243 or Bp22) and Bt (BtE264 or BtE555) and
monitored the infected mice up to 13 days post-infection (Table 1). The Bp strains were highly virulent, and
the majority of mice died within 13 days of receiving
initial Bp inoculums ranging from 100 to 500 colony
forming units (cfu; LD50 values 225 cfu and 16 cfu for
Bp K96243 and Bp 22, calculated on day 13). In contrast, almost every mouse recovered after either BtE264
or BtE555 infection, and the few deaths observed only
occurred when a massive inoculum was administered (>
106 cfu). Surviving BtE555-infected mice sacrificed at
day 13 exhibited no visible abscess formation in the
lungs, spleens, and liver, and no visible growth was
observed when undiluted homogenates from lung and
spleen were cultured on recovery plates. These data
point to an early clearance of the initial BtE555 infection. In the C. elegans model, BtE555 also exhibited low
levels of virulence in the worm infection assay, with

Figure 5 Bp-likeCPS confers multiple Bp-associated phenotypes to BtE555. (a) Immunofluorescence (IF) analysis of BtE555 and an isogenic
strain disrupted in the Bp-liksCPS region (CPS KO). Strains were stained with DAPI (to identify nuclei) and the anti-Bp CPS monoclonal antibody.
Wild-type BtE555 exhibits a clear distinctive halo of Bp-likeCPS expression around nuclei, while CPS KO strains exhibit either severely attenuated
or absent Bp-likeCPS expression. (b) Colony morphologies of strains on ashdown media. BtE264 colonies (top left) are relatively round, with
smooth contours, convex and glossy. In contrast, Bp K96243 colonies (bottom left) exhibit a wrinkled colony phenotype (white arrows). The
BtE555 strain exhibits a mixture of smooth and wrinkled colonies (top right, white arrows), and the Bp-likeCPS KO strain (bottom right) develops
small round violet colonies with no wrinkling. All strains were assayed after incubation at 37°C for 5 days. (c) Complement deposition assay.
Strains were assayed for their ability to avoid human complement C3b deposition on cell surfaces (red staining; see Materials and methods).
BtE264 is associated with abundant C3b deposition, while BtE555 exhibits minimal C3b accumulation. However, C3b deposition is clearly
observed in the Bp-likeCPS KO strain. (d) Macrophage survival assay. Strains were assayed for their ability to survive and replicate in RAW
macrophages, from 2 h to 8 h post-infection. BtE555 exhibits a highly significant ability to survive and replicate in macrophages compared to
the Bp-likeCPS KO strain (P = 0.002). BtE555 also exhibits a statistically significant enhancement for survival and replication compared to BtE264
(P = 0.049).

Discussion
In this study, we discovered variant Bt strains exhibiting
acquisition of a capsular polysaccharide gene cluster
(Bp-likeCPS) bearing striking similarities to a comparable cluster in Bp that is generally regarded as an essential mammalian virulence factor [25]. Analysis of the
Bp-likeCPS genes revealed that they are highly distinct
from preexisting polysaccharide synthesis genes normally found in Bt. Subtractive hybridization studies and
genomic comparisons have shown that that the majority
of the Bp CPS gene cluster is absent in Bt [24,25,46],
and the few polysaccharide-related genes in Bt exhibiting similarity to genes in the Bp CPS cluster
(BTH_I1343-1338 and BTH_I1327-1324) bear a relatively low similarity score of approximately 75% (74.8%
and 72.8% nucleotide and protein identity) to their Bp
homologs wcbT-wcbO and wcbC-manC. More importantly, the preexisting Bt genes are also by themselves
not sufficient to produce a capsular polysaccharide with
functional properties of Bp CPS (for example, evasion of
human complement binding, antibody cross-reactivity).
In contrast, the 34-kb Bp-likeCPS cluster acquired by
the variant Bt strains displays a general structure and
organization matching the intact Bp CPS cluster (wcbTmanC), and very high similarity scores to Bp CPS genes
(94.4% and 96% nucleotide and protein similarity). A
representative Bp-likeCPS-expressing Bt strain (BtE555)
also exhibited several Bp-like virulence traits (macrophage survival, resistance to complement deposition) in
a Bp-likeCPS-dependent manner, demonstrating that
the Bp-likeCPS is functionally expressed. To our knowledge, these variant Bt strains thus represent a novel subclass of strains that have not been described previously
in the literature.
Phylogenetic analysis using both aCGH and MLST
data revealed that the variant Bt strains occupy part of
an evolutionary clade that is genetically distinct from
the majority of Bt strains. Natural Bt populations from
Thailand are known to exhibit an MLST population
structure similar to that previously described for Bp
[47-49], where large numbers of closely related STs
(allelic combinations) appear to have been generated
through high levels of homologous recombination
between genetically conserved alleles. Supporting this,
the allele profiles of the 18 ST genotypes from Thai
strains are at linkage equilibrium (IAs = -0.0475; calculated using LIAN 3.0 [50]). Within the freely recombining Bt group, the reconstruction of robust relationships
is not possible by standard phylogenetic methods, and

Sim et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R89
http://genomebiology.com/2010/11/8/R89

thus the relatedness between these strains is more
appropriately represented as a network (Figure 4b). In
contrast, the three genotypes in the outlier evolutionary
subgroup represent a monophyletic cluster clearly distinct from this freely recombining group, a separation
that is further supported by whole-genome aCGH data.
Such phylogenetic divergence in the face of high recombination frequencies suggests that barriers to gene flow
may have emerged between strains in this outlier subgroup and the regular Bt population, which could be
either ecological or geographical (allopatry). For example, all three genotypes in the outlier subgroup were
associated with strains external to Thailand and Australia. These findings are consistent with the possibility
that we may be witnessing an incipient speciation event
leading to irreversible divergence between these two
groups.
Discovery of the variant Bt strains suggests that BplikeCPS acquisition may occur relatively freely in the
natural environment, but raises questions regarding the
ecological conditions under which Bp-likeCPS acquisition might have conferred a selective advantage. In the
literature, Bp CPS has been previously studied primarily
with respect to its role in facilitating mammalian infection by Bp, by facilitating bacterial attachment to pharyngeal epithelial cells [51] and evading complement
binding [31]. Bp CPS mutants have been shown to exhibit severely attenuated levels of virulence in multiple
mammalian animal models [25,28,29], and anti-Bp CPS
antibodies can also protect mice against extremely high
dosages of Bp [32]. However, BtE555 did not exhibit
enhanced levels of virulence relative to other Bt strains
in a highly sensitive animal model of acute melioidosis,
and recently, BtCDC3015869, another Bp-likeCPSexpressing variant strain, has also been shown to exhibit
low levels of virulence in hamsters and mice [10]. The
low levels of mammalian virulence associated with the
variant Bt strains, which are similar to regular Bt strains,
leaves open the possibility that the major ecological
force driving Bp-likeCPS acquisition in these variant
strains might not have been a specific requirement to
infect mammals. For example, as environmental microorganisms, Bt and Bp must have developed mechanisms
to survive environmental stresses encountered in soil,
such as desiccation, rapid changes in temperature, pH,
water content, and attack by other bacteria, nematodes
and amoebae, and it is tempting to speculate a need to
achieve improved environmental fitness might have provided the true evolutionary force for Bp-likeCPS acquisition. Under this concept, understanding the ‘function’ of
these genes, as viewed by natural selection, may thus
require consideration of the evolutionary forces acting
within the soil ecosystem. Probing this issue represents
an interesting area for future research.

Page 12 of 17

Finally, beyond their distinct geographical localities,
ecologic data also suggest that Bt strains in the outlier
subgroup (including the Bp-likeCPS expression strains),
may have a subtly altered ability to survive in different
environments and niches and possibly even survival in a
human host. For example, BtCDC3015869 (also known
as TXDOH or 2003015869) represents the only convincing example of Bt human infection in the literature,
albeit associated with an extreme scenario of near
drowning in a young infant, with subsequent rapid clinical recovery [42], and BtCDC2721121 was isolated from
the pleural wound of a 76 year old male from Louisiana
in 1997. Since exposures to new niche environments are
a well-known evolutionary force for the development of
novel functional adaptations [52,53], an enhanced propensity of the outlier strains to persist in novel geographical or ecological niches might have facilitated the
gain of subsequent genetic modifications, which may
have further enhanced virulence potential. Notably, our
data do not preclude the possibility that some of these
modifications may have involved the Bp-likeCPS cluster
itself. For example, there are >400 non-synonymous
SNPs between the Bp-likeCPS and Bp CPS clusters, of
which approximately 25% are predicted to cause nonconservative amino acid changes in the resulting
proteins. Such subtle alterations could also have contributed to slight differences in capsular polysaccharide
structure and ultimately enhanced Bp virulence. Addressing this will require detailed structural analyses of the
Bp and Bp-likeCPS products.

Conclusions
We have identified the existence of a unique set of variant Bt strains carrying molecular features of Bp, and
were also able to demonstrate, for the first time, the
presence of distinct phylogenetic clades in Bt. Our study
suggests that many virulence genes already exist as part
of the natural genomic reservoir available for microbial
recombination and lateral gene transfer (the species
‘pan-genome’). We note that compared to clinical
pathogens, comparatively less attention has been paid to
the large-scale genomic analysis of non-pathogens.
Expanded genomic surveys of both pathogenic and nonpathogenic Burkholderia species sampled from diverse
regions and isolation sources might allow further relationships among different virulence modifications to be
studied, and may prove useful in reconstructing the
genetic series of events associated with pathogen
evolution.

Bacterial strains and genomic DNA extraction

Bacterial cultures were grown in LB media and genomic
DNA was extracted using the Qiagen Genomic DNA kit
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For morphological characterization, strains were cultured on Ashdown medium at
37°C for 5 days. Appropriate species assignments were
confirmed by MLST analysis in this paper and [19] and
microbial phenotypes for Thailand strains (colony morphology, resistance to oxidase, colistin and gentamicin,
and assimilation of arabinose). Bt and Bp strains were
maintained in biosafety level environments BSL2 and
BSL3, respectively. BtE555 was also tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using a disk diffusion assay with the
exception of co-trimoxazole, which was assessed using
an E-test, and shown to be susceptible to amoxicillinclavulanate, ceftazidime, doxycycline, imipenem and cotrimoxazole.
Burkholderia pan-genome array construction

The BPGA contains 22.3 Mb of genomic sequence
derived from 23 Bp strains, four Bt strains, and one Burkholderia cenocepacia (Bc) strain (Additional file 1). Bp
and Bt pan-genomes were inferred by subjecting the
strains to a species-specific analysis pipeline (Additional
file 2). First, we aligned one strain genome to the appropriate species reference genome (K96243 for Bp and
BtE264 for Bt) using NUCmer [54]. Novel regions of
non-synteny were identified and concatenated to the
reference genome, forming a working pan-genome. Second, a new strain of the same species was then aligned
to this working pan-genome, and additional novel
sequences were further incorporated. This process was
iteratively repeated for all strains in that species, resulting in a 12.34-Mb Bp and 7.35-Mb Bt pan-genome.
Strains were aligned following the order in Additional
file 1; however, the specific strain order does not influence the final pan-genome size or composition (Additional file 3). For Bc, we performed a reciprocal BLAST
(BlastN, cutoff ≥ 1e-6) analysis between all Bc J2315 and
Bp K96243 genes to identify 3,019 Bc specific genes out
of 7,366, which were also added to the BPGA. BPGAs of
392,135 50-mer probes were constructed by maskless
photolithography (NimbleGen, Reykjavik, Iceland).
Besides Burkholderia-related probes (366,064), the
BPGA also contains 6,071 control probes of matching
GC content, melting temperature, and length, and
20,000 random sequence probes for background estimation and correction. The final composition of the BPGA
is shown in Additional file 2.

Array-based comparative genomic hybridization and data
analysis

Genomic DNAs were labeled with either Cy3 or Cy5
fluorescence dyes using a bacterial artificial chromosome
(BAC) array labeling kit (Kreatech, BV, Netherlands).
Two micrograms of labeled genomic DNA per strain
was hybridized to the BPGA at 52°C for 16 h in a
MAUI hybridization system (BioMicro Systems, Inc, Salt
Lake City Utah, USA). After hybridization and washing,
arrays were scanned on an Axon 4000B scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Signal intensity
files, generated by NimbleScan version 2.2 (NimbleGen
Systems, Madison, WI, USA), were normalized by the
LOWESS procedure (R console, Bioconductor package)
[55]. Technical validation of the array is presented in
Additional files 4 and 5. To detect regions of difference
between the Bt isolates and the BtE264 reference genome, log2 ratios of Bt isolate signals against BtE264 signals were processed using CGHScan 1.0 [56] using a
cutoff of log2 ratio ≤ (median - 2 × standard deviation,
significance level at 0.05). Recurrent regions of difference were defined as regions exhibiting variability in at
least 10% of strains (n ≥ 5). Circular chromosomal diagrams were generated using Circos [57]. The array data
were also visualized using SignalMap v 1.9.0.03 (NimbleGen Systems, Inc.). Microarray data and platform details
have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) database under accession number [GEO:
GSE18766].
BtE555 genome sequencing

BtE555 genomic DNAs were processed for paired-end
library construction and sequenced using a Genome
Analyser II instrument (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).
We mapped 100-bp paired-end reads to the reference
BtE264 genome initially with ELAND (Illumina) for
quality recalibration, and subsequently with Maq-0.7.1
under default parameters [58]. Sequence calls by Maq
were filtered to coordinates with ≥20× coverage after
PCR duplicate removal. Candidate SNPs were filtered
using the following rules: (1) discard SNPs within 5 bp
of a potential indel; (2) discard SNPs in reads of mapping quality <60; (3) discard SNPs in any 10-bp window
containing three or more SNPs; and (4) discard SNPs
with consensus quality calls of <60. SNPs occurring in
predicted GIs and tandem repeats were excluded. Functional classification of SNPs was performed using gene
co-ordinates from the BtE264 reference genome. De
novo assembly of the BtE555 paired-end reads was performed using PE-Assembler, an in-house toolkit (PA
and WS, manuscript in preparation). De novo assembled
contigs were mapped to the reference Bt E264 genome
using Nucmer [54] and Contig Aligner [59]. Genes on
contigs were predicted using FGENESB [60]. The

Sim et al. Genome Biology 2010, 11:R89

BtE555 sequence data are available in NCBI [GenBank:
AECN00000000].
Phylogenetic analysis (aCGH and MLST)

aCGH phylogenetic trees were based on regions of
variability detected by CGHScan, and generated using
Ward’s hierarchical clustering method and the Hamming distance between strains. Cluster robustness was
assessed by perturbing the aCGH data by either removing all STs represented by single strains or randomly
deleting 15% of the BtE264 probes over 100 iterations,
and computing consistencies between the perturbed and
original clusters using Kappa statistics (Additional file
15). MLST was performed as previously described [35]
on all 92 Bt isolates (Additional file 17), including 10
previously described Bt isolates [45] and 4 Bt isolates by
in silico analyses of genome sequences. Network reconstruction of the Bt genotypes was performed using
Splitstree 4.10 software [61]. In total, 17 out of 21 STs
are shared between the aCGH and MLST analyses.
Concordance between aCGH and MLST clusters was
determined based on correlating the segregation of specific STs within aCGH clusters, and the degree of ST
locus variance within each aCGH cluster (Additional
file 18) [40].
Western blotting and immunofluorescence

Crude extracts from strains were prepared as described
previously [62] and resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE. The
presence of EPS was examined by immunoblotting to a
nitrocellulose membrane and probing with monoclonal
antibody 4B11, which is specific to Bp CPS [36], followed by a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Dako A/S, Glostrup,
Denmark). Detection was performed using a chemiluminescence reagent (Roche Diagnostics GmbH,
Mannheim, Germany). For immunofluorescence studies,
log-phase bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Primary antibody incubations were performed at 37°C for 30 minutes in 1 ml of
hybridoma supernatant containing the 4B11 monoclonal
antibody at a dilution of 1:10. After pelleting and multiple
washings with 0.05% PBS-Tween20, secondary incubations were performed in 100 μl with Cy5 AffiniPure Fab
Fragment Donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immuno
Laboratory, West Grove, PA, USA) at 1:400 dilutions for
30 minutes at 37°C. After pelleting and multiple washings
with 0.05% PBS-Tween20, bacteria were then fixed with 1
ml of 2.5% paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes at 37°C
prior to staining with DAPI (1:2,000 dilutions from
20 mg/ml solution; Sigma-Aldrich Pte Ltd, Singapore) to
visualize nuclei. Samples were visualized on an Axiovert
200 m inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss) fitted with an
x-cite 120 Fluorescence Illumination system (EXFO,

Page 14 of 17

Mississauga, Ontario, Canada), and a Photometric
Coolsnap HQ high sensitivity system (Roper Scientific,
Friedland, Germany). Images were analyzed by Metamorph software (Molecular Devices Corporation, Downingtown, PA, USA).
Targeted disruption of the Bp-likeCPS cluster

The BtE555 CPS cluster was disrupted by an insertional
mutagenesis vector targeting the wcbB gene. Two fragments (sizes of 794 and 803 bp) upstream and downstream of positions 3,357,307 to 3,357,534 in wcbB were
PCR amplified from BtE555 genomic DNA, ligated to
one another, and cloned into the suicide vector pDM4
[63]. This vector (wcbBdel) was introduced into BtE555
by conjugation with a lpir + donor Escherichia coli
strain. Recombinants were selected on LB plates supplemented with chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml) and gentamicin (25 μg/ml). Strains exhibiting a recombination of the
wcbBdel vector into the endogenous wcbB gene were
confirmed by subsequent PCR analysis and sequencing.
Complement deposition assay

Log-phase bacteria were pelleted and incubated in 10%
normal human serum in a final 1 ml volume at 37°C for
15 minutes. Opsonization was terminated by the addition of EGTA (final concentration of 10 mM). After
three rounds of pelleting and washing with 1× PBS, bacterial pellets were fixed in 1 ml 2.5% paraformaldehyde.
Blocking was performed in 200 μl of PBS-0.05% Tween
20 overnight at 4°C. Primary antibody incubations were
performed at 37°C for 30 minutes in 20 μl of 0.05%
PBS-Tween20 with a monoclonal antibody to human
complement C3b-alpha (1:20 dilutions from 50 μg/ml;
Autogen Bioclear UK Ltd, Holly Ditch Farm, Mile Elm,
Calne, Wilts, UK). After washing, secondary antibody
incubations and imaging studies were performed as
described above (see Immunofluorescence).
Macrophage infection assay

We seeded 24-well flat-bottom plates with approximately 1 million RAW macrophage cells per well in
DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) and these were
allowed to adhere overnight. The adhered cells were
washed twice with PBS and exposed to log-phase bacteria at a 10:1 multiplicity of infection (MOI). After a
1-h infection period at 37°C, extracellular bacteria were
killed by replacing the medium with DMEM supplemented with fetal bovine serum and kanamycin (250 μg/ml).
At 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours post-infection, viable intracellular
bacteria were harvested by incubating the cells with
0.1% Triton-X100 at 37°C for 30 minutes, and quantified
by counting colony forming units (cfu) on plates serially
diluted with lysate. All experiments were performed in

duplicate on separate days. P-values between different
strains were calculated using a two-tailed t-test.

reference strain BtE264, BtE555 and the mutant CPS KO in rich

Intranasal mouse infection assays were performed as
previously described in [45]. For each bacterial strain, 30
BALB/c mice in groups of six were infected intra-nasally
with either Bp (5 to 3,600 cfu) or Bt (103-107 cfu). One
group was inoculated with PBS as a negative control.
Infected mice were monitored for survival at 4 and 13
days post-infection. LD50 values were then calculated
based on day 13 survival values using the method of
[64]. C. elegans assays were performed as described in
[44]. Forty L4-staged wild-type N2 Bristol C. elegans
were picked and exposed to a 100-μl bacterial lawn.
Infected animals were subsequently observed over a
5-day period.
