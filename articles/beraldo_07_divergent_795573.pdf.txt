Abstract
Background: We have previously reported that a Teiid lizard red blood cells (RBCs) such as
Ameiva ameiva and Tupinambis merianae controls intracellular calcium levels by displaying multiple
mechanisms. In these cells, calcium stores could be discharged not only by: thapsigargin, but also
by the Na+/H+ ionophore monensin, K+/H+ ionophore nigericin and the H+ pump inhibitor
bafilomycin as well as ionomycin. Moreover, these lizards possess a P2Y-type purinoceptors that
mobilize Ca2+ from intracellular stores upon ATP addition.
Results: Here we report, that RBCs from the tropidurid lizard Tropidurus torquatus store Ca2+ in
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pool but unlike in the referred Teiidae, these cells do not store calcium
in monensin-nigericin sensitive pools. Moreover, mitochondria from T. torquatus RBCs accumulate
Ca2+. Addition of ATP to a calcium-free medium does not increase the [Ca2+]c levels, however in
a calcium medium we observe an increase in cytosolic calcium. This is an indication that purinergic
receptors in these cells are P2X-like.
Conclusion: T. torquatus RBCs present different mechanisms from Teiid lizard red blood cells
(RBCs), for controlling its intracellular calcium levels. At T. torquatus the ion is only stored at
endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Moreover activation of purinergic receptor, P2X type,
was able to induce an influx of calcium from extracelullar medium. These studies contribute to the
understanding of the evolution of calcium homeostasis and signaling in nucleated RBCs.

Background
Calcium is an important intracellular messenger involved
in most physiological process from protozoa [1-5] to vertebrates [6,7]. In nucleated RBCs Ca2+ regulates several cell
functions including membrane permeability [8] and cell
differentiation [9,10]. The mechanisms of Ca2+ homeostasis involve the extrusion of this ion by a Ca2+-ATPase on
the plasma membrane and storage within intracellular

organelles. Most, if not all, intracellular organelles are
capable of storing Ca2+ including the ER, acidic pools, and
mitochondria among others [11,12]. Calcium uptake into
organelles proceeds against its chemical gradient and
requires energy to operate. In the ER there is a specialized
Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) [13]. In mitochondria the energy is
provided by the membrane potential [14]. The mitochondria have the capacity to store high concentrations of Ca2+,

not only by ATP hydrolysis but, mainly, by energy derived
from substrate oxidation.
Present in the immature stage of mammalian erythrocytes, birds, amphibians, fishes and reptiles, nucleated
RBCs differ from mature mammalian erythrocytes by the
presence of a nucleus and organelles. Despite this, few
studies of the mechanisms of Ca2+ homeostasis in nucleated RBCs have been performed [15,16]. By studying signal transduction pathways in lizard RBCs from different
families, we have been able to infer phylogenetic aspects
and mechanisms for these cells to maintain its Ca2+ homeostasis.
The squamates are divided in two large groups – Scleroglossa and Iguania. The first assembles the snakes,
amphisbaenas, and a diverse array of lizard families,
among them the Teiidae, while the last comprise a less
diverse assort of lizard families which includes the Tropiduridae. We have previously shown that RBCs from the
teiid lizards Ameiva ameiva and Tupinambis merianae (Scleroglossa) display two distinct types of intracellular compartments involved in calcium homeostasis. These cells
display the P2Y type purinoceptors that are probably coupled to G protein and promote an increase of [Ca2+]c
through the InsP3 pathway [17-20]. Here we show that
RBCs of the tropidurid Tropidurus torquatus (Iguania) store
calcium in the classical compartment ER and in mitochondria. Differently from the Teiidae studied, there is a
P2X purinoceptor in Tropidurus torquatus that promotes an
increase of [Ca2+]c by influx of Ca2+ from extracellular
medium.

Results
Intracellular Ca2+ stores in T. torquatus RBCs
By using spectrofluorimetry and loading RBCs from Tropidurus torquatus with Fluo-3 AM, we characterized the intracellular pools involved in calcium homeostasis within
these cells. We found [Ca2+]c in the RBCs of Tropidurus
torquatus around 51,2 ± 1,7 nM (n = 18). In order to verify
if T. torquatus RBCs contain intracellular Ca2+ stores compartments, the cells were treated with the tumor promoter
thapsigargin, known to specifically inhibit the Ca2+
ATPase from the sarco-endoplasmic reticulum (SERCA)
[21]. Fig 1A shows that the addition of thapsigargin (5
µM) resulted in a sustained increase of cytosolic Ca2+
([Ca2+]c) of 18.1 ± 2.1 nM (n = 6) when the cells were
incubated in Ca2+ medium (1 mM). Addition of thapsigargin in Ca2+-free medium (supplemented with 15 mM
EGTA) resulted in an increase of fluorescence in RBCs of
T. torquatus loaded with Fluo-3 AM. Subsequent addition
of ionomycin (10 µM) resulted in further increased fluorescence (Fig 1B) indicating the presence of other Ca2+stores. If the calcium pools were depleted by ionomycin,
thapsigargin does not elicit any further calcium release

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6793/7/7

(Fig 1C). The increase in arbitrary fluorescence units
observed on Fig 1B and 1C indicate an increase on intracellular Ca2+ on Tropiduridae lizards RBCs. As these experiments were performed in a free Ca2+ medium we
therefore could not calculate the intracellular changes on
Ca2+..
Differently from Teiidae family, RBCs from Tropiduridae
lizards are not sensitive to Monensine (ionophore Na+/
H+) (Fig 1D) nor Nigericine (ionophore K+/H+) (data not
shown).
Purinergic receptors in T. torquatus RBCs
ATP triggers calcium release in the RBCs of Ameiva ameiva
and Tupinambis merianae lizards. In these cells, we have
characterized the G-protein coupled P2Y type receptor as
ATP mobilized calcium from internal pools in a calciumfree medium. We also reported that the second messenger
InsP3 could be the signal for calcium mobilization from
internal pools within these cells. In Tropidurus torquatus,
the addition of ATP (50 µM) promotes a sustained
increase of [Ca2+]c of 26.4 ± 3.4 nM (n = 10) when the cells
are incubated with Fluo-3 AM in Ca2+ medium (CaCl2 1
mM) (Fig 2A). To verify if the purinergic receptor was a P1
(binding only adenosine) we have used a non hydrolysable ATP analogue ATPγS. In Fig 2B, we showed that ATPγS
(50 µM) induced an increase in the [Ca2+]c of 33.2 ± 3.4
nM (n = 4). To observe the presence of a P2Y purinoceptors we treated the RBCs with a specific antagonist to this
type of receptor. We have shown that addition of
α2MetATP (50 µM) did not induce an increase of [Ca2+]c
in RBCs from T. torquatus loaded with Fluo-3 AM (Fig 2C).
When the experiments were performed in a medium without Ca2+ in the presence of EGTA (15 mM) no effect was
observed in fluorescence with addition of ATP (50 µM),
although further addition of ionomycin (10 µM) promotes Ca2+ release (Fig 2D). When we incubated the
RBCs-loaded with Fluo-3 AM- with the purinergic receptors P2 type inhibitors such as Suramin (50 µM) (Fig 2E),
for 30 min, no [Ca2+]c increase was observed with addition of ATP (50 µM). These results indicate that the
increase of [Ca2+]c, promoted by purinergic receptors agonists, is from extracellular medium by activation of a Ca2+channel in the plasma membrane, probably a P2X type.
Role of mitochondria in Ca2+ homeostasis
To verify the role of mitochondria on Ca2+ storing in RBCs
from T. torquatus we loaded the erythrocytes with mitochondria indicator Mito Fluor Green (5 µM) (Fig 3A) (n =
3) and with Ca2+ mitochondrial indicator Rhod-2 AM (5
µM) (Fig 3B) (n = 3). Co-localization of the indicators (Fig
3C) denotes the presence of mitochondria around the
nucleus. Similar to ER in T. torquatus RBCs mitochondria
are able to store Ca2+. The disruption of mitochondrial

Mitochondrion has an important role on Ca2+ homeostasis in T. torquatus RBCs. These cells were incubated with
the citosolic Ca2+ indicator Fluo 4 AM and with mitochondrial Ca2+ indicator Rhod-2 AM. The addition of ATP (50
µM), as shown previously in Fig 2A, induced an increase
of intracellular Ca2+ by activation of a membrane purinoceptor P2X type that promotes an influx of the ion. Here
we show the increase of mitochondria [Ca2+]mt after an
increase of [Ca2+]c induced by ATP (50 µM) in T. torquaturs
RBCs loaded with both Fluo 4 AM and Rhod-2 AM (in the
Ca2+ medium) (Fig 4A) (n = 4). In contrast to what is
shown above, in a free Ca2+ medium, ATP did not induce
an increase of [Ca2+]c and in this case we did not observe
an increase of [Ca2+]mt. (Fig 4B) (n = 4). Similar results
were observed when we depleted the ER by the addition
of Thapsigargin (5 µM) (Fig 4C) (n = 4) or with the ionophore ionomycin (10 µM) (Fig 4D) (n = 4). The experiments in Fig. 5 provide evidence that there is a temporal
correlation between the mitochondrial Ca2+ rise and the
levels of NADPH. When we promoted an increase of
citosolic Ca2+ by ATP (Fig 5A) or ionomycin (Fig 5C) in a
Ca2+ medium, we observed an increase of mitochondrial

Ca2+ and a concomitant increase of auto fluorescence of
NADPH. However in a free Ca2+ medium ATP is not able
to induce an increase of [Ca2+]c and in this case there is no
increase of mitochondrial Ca2+ or NADPH (Fig 5B) (n =
3).

Discussion
The effect of SERCA inhibitor thapsigargin indicates that
in RBCs from T. torquatus ER can sequester Ca2+ and that
blockage of the pump results in a rapid release of this ion
to the cytosol. The fact of the increase of [Ca2+]c, induced
by thapsigargin, in T. torquatus was lower than the values
found for RBCs in the previously studied teiid lizards suggests that the capacity of the ER to sequester Ca2+ is higher
in the Teiidae, or the affinity of SERCA pump to thapsigargin is lower in T. torquatus. Differences on SERCA
pump sensitivity to thapsigargin have been reported in
different models. For example, micromolar concentrations of thapsigargin inhibit SERCAs in non-mammalian
vertebrate cells of turtles [22,23] and chicken granulosa
cells [24] or parasites [25,26]. Thapsigargin induced a sustained intracellular Ca2+ increase in a calcium medium.
Differently, in a calcium free medium a calcium spike
occurs. These data indicated that, in a calcium medium,
there is Ca2+ mobilization from ER and an activation of

influx of Ca2+ from extracellular medium. This mechanism, known as "Capacitative Calcium entry" is very common in non excitable cells [27] and our previous reports
have shown the presence of this mechanism on RBCs
from Teeidae family [28,29].
Not only ER but almost all intracellular organelles are able
to store Ca2+ The diversity of Ca2+ pools varies among different cell types. Here we show that endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria are able to store Ca2+ in RBCs from
T. torquatus. We also observed that ionomicyn was able to
deplete calcium stores after thapsigargin treatment. However reversing the addition do not result on calcium
release from thapsigargin. This data indicates the existence
of a third calcium pool in RBCs from T. torquatus. This
could be a Golgi-type Ca2+ pool – which is insensitive to
thapsigargin. Another possibility was the presence of uni-

dentified subcompartment of ER expressing an thapsigargin-insensitive Ca2+-ATPase [30,31].
The mitochondria, in most mammalian cells loaded with
fluorescent indicators, appear disperse in the cytosol
[32,33]. However, as we showed, in T. torquatus RBCs
mitochondria is located around the nucleus, similar to
other nucleated RBCs [34]. This indicates that this
organelle is concentrated in a small region of the cell. In
nucleated RBCs the advantage of organelles being concentrated in a small region of the cell leads to an increase of
hemoglobin storage and consequently increasing the oxygen transport to tissues. Mitochondria is able to accumulate Ca2+ by the increase of cytosolic Ca2+ induced by
influx of Ca2+ from intracellular medium or by mobilization from intracellular stores in several models [35-37].
The capacity of mitochondria accumulates Ca2+ at higher

purinoceptors cannot be ruled out. Possibly there are
other signaling pathways involved in the signal transduction in the lizard's RBCs. For example, RBCs from T.
torquatus could show a coupled G-protein purinoceptor
that promotes an increase or decrease of other second
messengers, such as cAMP or cGMP.
Probably these mechanisms appeared separately in the
evolution of these lizard's families.

Conclusion
In this work we founded that T. torquatus RBCs do not
store calcium at acidic pools and display different mechanisms for controlling intracellular calcium levels when
compared with RBCs from the Teiid family. Interestingly,
the purinergic receptors present in these cells was found to
be a P2X type. These receptors were activated in a medium
containing extracellular calcium.

concentrations, in response to an agonist, was explained
by Rizzuto et al (1993) [38]. The authors have demonstrated the proximity of mitochondria and ER and the
presence of microdomains in the cytosol where high concentrations of Ca2+ are observed. By loading of mitochondrial Ca2+ with Rhod 2 AM we show that in lizards RBCs
mitochondria has a fundamental role in Ca2+ homeostasis. There is an increase of mitochondrial [Ca2+]c promoted by mobilization of Ca2+ from ER or by influx of this
ion by activation of purinergic receptors in the plasma
membrane.

Lizards
Specimens of Tropidurus torquatus were obtained at Lageado, state of Tocantins, Brazil. The blood, collected from
the lizard's tail with a syringe, was centrifuged at 1500 g
for 5 min and washed in phosphate-buffered isotonic
saline (PBS: 7.5 mM sodium phosphate, 137 mM NaCl,
pH 7.2). Leucocytes were removed from RBCs by subjecting the blood to a cellulose powder column (Whatman
CF11, fibrous long Sigma, U.K.) adapted from Homewood and Neame (1976) [44]. The animals were bleeded
on intervals of 3 months and after 3 bleeding the animals
were sacrificed. The animals were used in accord with animal protocol approval 089/03 "Comparative studies of
cell signaling in malaria parasite diseases – Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation and Biomedical Sciences
Institute/USP-Ethical Committee for animal research"
(22/09/2003 Meeting).

In squamates all types of purinergic receptors have been
found. In the same organ or tissue most subtypes of receptor are present. For example, in the aorta the lizard Agama
sp (Iguania) (type P1 and P2) [39] and the snake Thamnophis sirtilis (type P2X and P2Y) [40]. In nucleated RBCs the
presence of purinoceptors (P2Y-coupled to G protein)
have been reported in avian species [41] and lizards from
Teiidae family [42]. In T. torquatus our results indicate the
presence of a P2X (ion channel) purinergic receptor that
promotes an influx of Ca2+ from an extracellullar
medium. We also show that P2 purinergic receptor antagonist Suramin [43] is able to block the effect of ATP in
RBCs from T. torquatus. The presence of other types of
