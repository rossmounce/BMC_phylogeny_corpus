Abstract
Background: Inactivating mutations of SMAD4 are frequent in metastatic colorectal carcinomas. In previous
analyses, we were able to show that restoration of Smad4 expression in Smad4-deficient SW480 human colon
carcinoma cells was adequate to suppress tumorigenicity and invasive potential, whereas in vitro cell growth was
not affected. Using this cellular model system, we searched for new Smad4 targets comparing nuclear
subproteomes derived from Smad4 re-expressing and Smad4 negative SW480 cells.
Methods: High resolution two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis was applied to identify novel Smad4 targets in
the nuclear subproteome of Smad4 re-expressing SW480 cells. The identified candidate protein Keratin 23 was
further characterized by tandem affinity purification. Immunoprecipitation, subfractionation and immunolocalization
studies in combination with RNAi were used to validate the Keratin 23-14-3-3ε interaction.
Results: We identified keratins 8 and 18, heat shock proteins 60 and 70, plectin 1, as well as 14-3-3ε and g as novel
proteins present in the KRT23-interacting complex. Co-immunoprecipitation and subfractionation analyses as well
as immunolocalization studies in our Smad4-SW480 model cells provided further evidence that KRT23 associates
with 14-3-3ε and that Smad4 dependent KRT23 up-regulation induces a shift of the 14-3-3ε protein from a nuclear
to a cytoplasmic localization.
Conclusion: Based on our findings we propose a new regulatory circuitry involving Smad4 dependent upregulation of KRT23 (directly or indirectly) which in turn modulates the interaction between KRT23 and 14-3-3ε
leading to a cytoplasmic sequestration of 14-3-3ε. This cytoplasmic KRT23-14-3-3 interaction may alter the
functional status of the well described 14-3-3 scaffold protein, known to regulate key cellular processes, such as
signal transduction, cell cycle control, and apoptosis and may thus be a previously unappreciated facet of the
Smad4 tumor suppressive circuitry.

Background
The inactivation of the tumor suppressor DPC4 (deleted
in pancreatic carcinoma, locus 4), also called SMAD4 or
MADH4 is most frequently found in ductal pancreatic
adenocarcinomas (approx. 50%) and metastatic colon
carcinomas (approx. 30%) [1,2].
Smad4 and its homologs mediate signals from cytokines of the transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b)
family from cell surface receptors to the nucleus where

they regulate a diverse array of target genes involved in
numerous biological functions including embryonic
development, cell growth and differentiation, modulation of immune responses, and bone formation.
Ligand induced TGF-b receptor stimulation leads to
the formation of a hetero-tetrameric receptor complex
of two identical heterodimers, which is comprised of a
type I and a type II receptor family member, each. Upon
receptor activation the receptor-regulated Smads (RSmads) can transiently interact with the type I receptor.
R-Smads are thereby C-terminally phosphorylated by
the receptor kinase and, once phosphorylated, they form
a hetero-oligomeric complex with the “common-

mediator” Smad4. This complex translocates into the
nucleus, where it regulates the transcription levels of
target genes by interacting with other transcription factors and by recruiting transcriptional co-activators or
co-repressors [3]. In addition to R-Smads there are also
inhibitory Smads (I-Smads) and other signaling molecules that feed into the TGF-b-Smad signalling cascade
such as ERK, JNK and PKC [4].
This rather complex mode of target gene regulation
involving Smad4 explains why currently more than 1000
genes were described to be either directly or indirectly
regulated by Smad4 [5]. Furthermore, it is obvious that
the cellular context will play a crucial role in defining
the subset of Smad4 target genes relevant in a particular
cellular differentiation state.
In the current work, we focused on colon carcinoma
(SW480) cells to define potential Smad4 target genes
involved in the neoplastic transformation process of this
particular cell type. For the detailed investigation of
Smad4’s tumor suppressor functions, we stably reexpressed Smad4 via gene transfer in human Smad4deficient SW480 tumor cells [6]. We were able to show
that re-expression of Smad4 in these colon carcinoma
cells was not sufficient to restore TGF-b responsiveness.
These cells have accumulated a number of other oncogenic alterations in addition to and presumably prior to
Smad4 inactivation [6,7], likely explaining the TGF-b
resistance of Smad4 re-expressing derivatives. However,
the re-expression of Smad4 in SW480 cells was sufficient to suppress tumor growth in vivo [6] confirming
that these cells provide an adequate model to investigate
Smad4 tumor suppressor function.
Here we focused on the study of the nuclear subproteome of Smad4 re-expressing SW480 cells in comparison to its Smad4 negative cells by establishing a
subfractionation strategy coupled with the difference gel
electrophoresis (DIGE) system and subsequent MALDIMS-based peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) to identify
differentially expressed proteins.
Of the proteins which were identified as highly upregulated in Smad4 re-expressing SW480 cells, we chose
to follow-up on the KRT23 protein. Keratins are major
structural proteins in epithelial cells. The keratin multigene family contains 50 individual members, which can
be divided in two groups: (i) acidic forms and (ii) basic
forms. The KRT9-23 belongs to the acidic group,
whereas KRT1-8 are basic keratins [8]. Generally, one
basic and one acidic keratin heterodimerize in order to
form a functionally active intermediate filament. It has
been postulated that the mechanical properties of these
dimers are regulated by their specific keratin composition [9]. An association of differential expression patterns of keratins with tumor progression and the utility
of measuring the keratin expression status for a

Page 2 of 14

differentiation between normal und tumor cells has
been established [10-13]. Furthermore, it has been
shown that in normal cellular senescence primary
KRT8/18, i.e. keratins that are expressed first during tissue development, become partly substituted by secondary or later keratins (e.g. KRT20, KRT7) in a tissue
dependent manner. This effect, however, is disrupted in
transformed cells and thus expression profiling of keratins can be used for cancer diagnosis, i.e. the type of
keratin detected allows the distinction between normal
and cancerous tissue and for the definition of the type
of carcinoma, even when the tumor is present as metastasis of unknown origin [14-16]. More recently, the classical structural role of keratins was extended to their
involvement in cell signalling, stress response and apoptosis, mostly through their interaction with other proteins and/or their phosphorylation, glycosylation,
transglutamination, caspase cleavage and ubiquitination
state affecting keratin organization, distribution, turnover and function [17]. In colorectal microsatellite
instable tumors the over-expression of KRT23 led to
cell death. Due to this cellular response KRT23 was
associated with a potential role as a tumor suppressor in
this subset of colorectal cancers [18].
In this work we present data showing the interaction
between 14-3-3 proteins and KRT23. The 14-3-3 protein
family consists of 7 isoforms in mammalian cells (b, g, ε,
h, s, τ, ξ) which form homo- and hetrerodimers with
each other [19]. These dimers bind preferentially to the
phosphorylated motifs RSXpSXP and RXXXpSXP present on most known 14-3-3 binding proteins [20]. The
universal nature of this protein family has been shown
using proteomic approaches [21-24]. The identified
broad spectrum of 14-3-3 interacting partners illustrates
the vast array of processes in which this protein family
is involved. Based on the discovery of cytoplasmic
sequestration of BAD a general sequestration model was
postulated [25]. The core of this sequestration model is
a nuclear export signal (NES)-like domain within the
14-3-3 molecules that bind to target proteins. Upon
binding, NES sequences of the target proteins become
exposed, which initiates translocation of the target protein from the nucleus into the cytoplasm thereby inhibiting the activity of the target molecule [26,27]. As
numerous 14-3-3 interaction partners have been implicated in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, it is not surprising that 14-3-3 proteins play a crucial role in
carcinogenesis. Examples are the sequestration of
CDC25s and p21 through 14-3-3ε [28-31].
Here, we report that re-expression of Smad4 in the
SW480 cells strongly induces KRT23 expression, both at
the transcript and protein level. A tandem affinity purification (TAP) assay with KRT23 as bait was performed
to identify KRT23 interacting proteins. This assay

Liffers et al. BMC Cancer 2011, 11:137
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/11/137

revealed that 14-3-3ε is part of the KRT23-binding complex and that Smad4 re-expression and KRT23 up-regulation correlates with cytoplasmic translocalization of
14-3-3ε. In summary, our data suggest that Smad4dependent KRT23 expression is probably important for
the cellular localization of 14-3-3ε. This, in turn, will
likely influence cellular signaling through 14-3-3 binding
partners involved - amongst others - in cell cycle, intracellular trafficking/targeting and signal transduction; all
these processes are known to be altered in
carcinogenesis.

Methods
Reagents and Cell culture - Monoclonal anti-tubulin
(TUB2.1) and anti-FLAG (M2) antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Anti-lamin B (C-20) and anti-VSVG (P5D4) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells as well as Smad4 negative
and re-expressing derivatives of the colon carcinoma
cell line SW480 [32] were cultured in DMEM media
supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics.
DNA Constructs and Transient Transfection - cDNAs
encoding the wild type FLAG-tagged KRT23 was amplified by PCR and ligated into the SalI-EcoRI site of the
pMT2SM expression vector. The expression vector for
VSV-G-tagged 14-3-3ε (pcDNA3-VSV-G-14-3-3ε) was
kindly donated by H. Hermeking (LMU München, Germany). Cells were seeded onto 10 cm dishes 18 to 24 h
prior to transfection and then transiently transfected at
60 to 70% confluence using FuGENE-6 transfection
reagent (Roche Diagnostics). 48 h after transfection,
cells were harvested for further assays.
Immunoprecipitation, Cell Fractionation and Immunoblotting - Smad4 re-expressing and Smad4 negative
SW480 cells were lysed in ice cold RIPA buffer to prepare whole cell lysates. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation. HEK 293T cells were transfected with FlagKRT23 and/or VSV-G-14-3-3ε expression vectors.
Transfected cells were lysed in RIPA buffer to prepare
whole cell lysates. Immunoprecipitation was performed
using ANTI-FLAG M2-affinity agarose, with constant
agitation overnight at 4°C. After extensive washes, proteins bound to the beads were eluted with denaturing
Laemmli buffer. To isolate nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions, cells were washed twice with cold PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of hypotonic buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl
pH 7.4, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1.5 mM KCl, 0.1% NP-40, 50
mM NaF, 2 mM sodium orthovanadate, and protease
inhibitors (Complete, Roche)). Cells were allowed to
swell on ice for 10 min and then passed several times
through a 26 1/2 gauge syringe needle, followed by centrifugation at 800 × g. The supernatants were further
centrifuged at 15,000 × g to remove insoluble pellets,

and the resulting supernatants were collected as the
cytoplasmic fractions. The pellets were resuspended in
100 μl of TKM buffer (20 mM Tris-acetate pH 7.4, 50
mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors). After centrifugation at 15,000 × g
for 10 min, the supernatants were collected like the
nuclear fractions. Whole cell lysates from SW480 cells,
immunoprecipitated proteins and proteins derived from
cell fractionation were subjected to SDS-PAGE and
transferred onto polyvinylidinedifluoride membranes
(Millipore), respectively. The membranes were incubated
with the indicated antibodies followed by the corresponding secondary antibodies. The membranes were
then developed with the ECL Western Blotting Detection System (Pierce).
Protein Isolation from Nuclear Fractions for 2D-PAGE
Analyses - For nuclear fractionation and protein isolation 10 cell culture dishes (10 cm) each from Smad4 reexpressing and Smad4 negative SW480 cells were harvested. Cell breakage was done following swelling cells
in hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mM NaCl,
5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100) with a dounce homogenisator. Broken cells were centrifugated (1,000 × g, 4°
C, 10 min) to collect a crude nucleus fraction. The
nuclei containing pellet was transferred onto an iodixanol density step gradient (25%, 30%, 35% (v/v)). Separation over the gradient was done by centrifugation
(16,000 × g, 4°C, 30 min) and the nucleus fraction was
collected at the interphase located approximately
between the 30% (v/v) and 35% (v/v) iodixanol. The collected fraction was subsequently diluted 1:2 in TKM
buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 250 mM Sucrose, 50 mM
KCl, 5 mM MgCl2; supplemented with protease inhibitors). Resuspended nuclei were centrifugated (1,000 × g,
4°C, 20 min) and washed two additional times in TKM
buffer. The harvested nuclei were snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80°C until 2D-PAGE separation.
2D Gel Electrophoresis - Collected nuclear fractions
were dissolved in DIGE buffer (30 mM Tris, pH 8.5, 2 M
thiourea, 7 M urea, 4% CHAPS). For a minimal labeling
of proteins with CyDyes (GE Healthcare) 50 μg protein
was incubated with 400 pmol CyDye dissolved in anhydrous DMF p.a. After 30 min of incubation in the dark
on ice 10 pmol lysine was added to stop the labeling reaction. Cy3 and Cy5 labels were used for Smad4 negative
and Smad4 positive samples, respectively. As internal
standard pooled lysates of nuclear fractions containing
equal amounts of protein, each, from Smad4 re-expressing and negative cells were Cy2 labeled. After combining
all three samples the mixture was applied on the IEF tube
gel (20 cm × 0.7 mm). The IEF was performed with carrier ampholyte tube gels with an ampholyte mixture ranging from pH 2-11 for 8.05 kVh. After IEF tube gels were
ejected, incubated in equilibration buffer (125 mM Tris

Liffers et al. BMC Cancer 2011, 11:137
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/11/137

pH 6.8, 40% (w/v) Glycerol, 3% (w/v) SDS, 65 mM DTT)
for 10 min and subsequently applied on the second
dimension gel (20 cm × 30 cm × 0.7 mm). The second
dimension (SDS-PAGE) consisted of 15.2%T, 1.3%C
polyacrylamide gels which were run in a Tris-Glycine
buffer system. For protein identification the preparative
gel format was: 20 cm × 1.5 mm for tube gels and 20 cm
× 30 cm × 1.5 mm for SDS-PAGE.
Image Analysis - CyDye labeled proteins were visualized by Typhoon 9400 laser scanner (GE Healthcare)
according to the user manual. Image analysis was performed with the DIA software tool (GE Healthcare) for
single gel comparison and the Biological Variance Analysis (BVA) software tool (GE Healthcare) in case of
matching gel sets. Parameters for significant changes in
the spot pattern were set as follows: changes in the spot
volume had to be two-fold, p-value of Student’s T-test
had to be ≤ 0.05 and the spot had to be detected in at
least five of six gel sets.
Tryptic in-gel Digestion and MALDI-MS Protein Identification - For protein identification, silver stained protein spots or bands of interest were cut from a
preparative gel, in-gel digested with trypsin (Promega,
Madison, WI) and extracted as described previously [33].
For MALDI-MS target preparation peptides were concentrated via ZipTips™, eluted on the MALDI-target
with 1.2 μL matrix solution (a-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid in ACN and 0,1% (v/v) TFA (1:2)) and analyzed using the UltraflexTM (Bruker Daltoniks). PMF
spectra were acquired in positive mode with 20 kV target voltage and pulsed ion extraction of 17.25 kV. The
reflector and detector voltage was set to 21 kV and 1.7
kV, respectively. Peak detection was carried out using
FlexAnalysis 1.2 (Bruker Daltonics) with a S/N threshold
of 2.5. The monoisotopic peptide mass values were
transferred to ProteinScape™ (Bruker Daltonics) for
subsequent protein identification via automated database
analysis against the human IPI (V3.27; 67528 entries) by
Profound (2002.03.01). To confirm the results obtained
a randomized database combined with a normal IPI
human database was performed. Searches were carried
out with a mass tolerance of 100 ppm. Furthermore,
propionamide (C, +71 Da) was set as a fixed and oxidation (M, +16 Da) as a variable modification and for the
cleavage enzyme (trypsin) one missed cleavage site was
allowed. Internal re-calibration of the obtained data was
performed using a calibrant list and contained mass
values were subsequently excluded prior database
search. A Z score of 1.65 was used as threshold for the
protein identification.
Protein Identification of TAP Purified Proteins - The
Protein identification of TAP purified proteins were
done by liquid chromatography (LC)-tandem MS (MS/
MS). LC-MS/MS measurements were done with tryptic

Page 4 of 14

peptide extracts in 5% (v/v) FA by using a LC Packings
Ultimate capillary LC system coupled to 4000 Q Trap™
(Applied Biosystems). Ionspray voltage was set to 3.0 3.2 kV in positive mode. EMS-scan was performed over
a mass range from 400 to 1400 m/z. For MS/MS-scans
the three highest signals were isolated and fragmentation was done with collision energy between 15-60 V
according to m and z. MGF data were extracted from
the raw data using Analyst 1.4.1 (Applied Biosystems)
and Mascot (2.2.0) was used for database searches
against the human IPI (V3.27; 67528 entries). To confirm the results, a randomized database combined with
a normal IPI human database was performed. The mass
accuracy was set to 1.5 Da for precursor ions and 0.5
Da for fragment ions. Further modification of cysteine
by propionamide (C, +71 Da) was set as a fixed modification and oxidation of methionine (M, +16 Da) was set
as a variable modification. One missed cleavage site for
the tryptic digestion was allowed. Proteins were identified with three different peptides with an ion score of 32
and higher.
RNA Isolation and Northern Blotting - Total RNA
was prepared from Smad4 re-expressing and negative
cells as described previously [6]. Briefly, 5 μg total RNA
was applied on 1% formaldehyde-agarose gel. Subsequently the gel was blotted onto Hybond N membranes
(Amersham) with SSC buffer (0.15 M Sodium citrate
pH 7.0, 1.5 M NaCl) and filters were hybridized at 50°C
overnight with radiolabeled probes using the following
oligonucleotides 5’-cgcgtcgaccaccatggactacaaggacgacgat
gacaagaactccggacacagcttcag-3’ and 5’-acagaattcaacaggcggaaactttcattg-3.
Production of Transgenic TAP-KRT23 SW480 Cells The coding region of KRT23 was PCR-amplified from
an image clone using the oligonucleotides 5’-caattgaactc
cggacacagcttcag-3’ and 5’-gtcgactcatgcgtgcttttggattt-3’.
The resulting PCR-products were inserted into the
MfeI, SalI site of retroviral vector pBabe-puro. The TAP
affinity tag was amplified from pRAV-FLAG (kindly provided by X. Liu, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO,
USA) with the oligonucleotides 5’-cgggatccatggcgcaacacgatgaagc-3’ and 5’-gccaattgcttgtcatcgtcgtccttg-3’. Resulting PCR-fragments were digested with BamHI and MfeI
and subsequently ligated into the pBabepuro vector containing the KRT23 sequence. The correct insert
sequences of the newly generated pBabeTAP-KRT23
vector were confirmed by cycle sequencing analysis.
Generation of the TAP-KRT23 expression cassette containing retrovirus was done in HEK 293T cells. Transfection of HEK 293T cells was done with FuGene
(Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
For retroviral virus particle generation the packaging
pHIT60 and the envelope pHITG plasmids were
cotransfected together with the pBabeTAP-KRT23

retroviral vector. Viral infection of SW480 cells was
done with filtered (0.45 μm pore size) retroviral particles
released from 293T cells. Transduced SW480 cells were
selected with 2 μg/mL puromycin (Sigma).
Tandem Affinity Purification (TAP) - SW480 cell lines
stably expressing the TAP-tagged KRT23 protein were
cultured in 14.5 cm culture dishes. Confluent SW480
cells from 15 dishes were used in each purification
experiment. Before lysis, cells were washed three times
with cold PBS and then lysed directly on the dish (50
mM Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM
DTT, 2% (v/v) Trition X-100, 50 mM NaF, 2 mM
NaVO4 and protease inhibitor cocktail (complete mini,
Roche)). After preclearing the samples (2 × 10 min, 1,000
× g, 4°C) the supernatants were incubated with 100 μL
IgG-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4°C, followed
by a washing step with cleavage buffer (50 mM Tris, pH
7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 2% (v/v)
Trition X-100, 50 mM NaF, 2 mM NaVO4) and subsequent TEV cleavage in 200 μl cleavage buffer with 100
units of TEV protease (Invitrogen). The TEV eluate was
transferred onto 50 μL ANTI-FLAG M2-Agarose (Sigma)
and incubated for 1 h at 4°C. After extensively washing
the agarose beads were treated with 50 μl elution buffer
(62.5 mM Tris pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (w/v) Glycerin) for 3 min at room temperature.
Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope Analysis - SW480
cells were seeded on glass coverslips. After 48 h cells
were fixed in 3.5% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100. Before primary antibodies were applied (a-Flag M2 (mouse, Sigma); a-14-33ε (rabbit, Santa Cruz); a-b-tubulin (mouse, Sigma)) cells
were blocked with 1% BSA. Secondary antibodies were
labeled as followed: a-mouse IgG-FITC (Dianova) and arabbit IgG-TRITC (Dianova). Images of immunostained
cells were generated with a Leica TCS SP2 confocal laser
scanning microscope and processed with the Leica Confocal Software Version 2.5, build 1227.
ShRNA Down-Regulation of Keratin 23 in SW480
cells - Keratin 23 expression cells was silenced in
SW480 cells by shRNAknock-down. The following oligonucleotide pairs KRT23-1506s: 5’-CCGGGCACGAAATCTGCTTTGGAAAGCTCGAGGTTTCCAA

into the EcoRI/AgeI site of the pLKO.1 puro vector
(kindly provided by Sheila Stewart). Lentiviruses were
made by transfecting packaging cells (HEK 293T) with a

3-plasmid system. DNA for transfections was prepared
by mixing 12 μg pCMVΔRR8.2, 1 μg pHIT G and 12 μg
pLKO.1 plasmid DNA with 62 μl of 2 M CaCl 2 in a
final volume of 500 μl. Subsequently 500 μl of 2x HBS
phosphate buffer was dropwise added to the mixture
and incubated for 10 min at RT. The 1 ml transfection
mixture was added to 50% confluent HEK 293T cell
seeded the day before into a 10 cm well plate. Cells
were incubated for 16 h (37°C and 10% CO2), before the
media was changed to remove remaining transfection
reagent. Lentiviral supernatants were collected at 36 h
post-transfection and for each infection 3 ml supernatant containing 4 μg/ml polybrene was immediately
used to infect target cells seeded the day before in 6
well plates to reach 70% confluency on the day of infection. Cells were incubated for 24 h, and the media was
changed to remove virus particles. To control infection
rate a parallel infection under the identical conditions
targeting the same cell line was prepared using a lentiviral GFP expression control vector (pRRLU6-CPPTpSK-GFP, kindly provided by Sheila Stewart). 6 days
after infection 2 μg/ml puromycin was added to the cell
culture media. The knock-down efficiency was monitored by qRT-PCR using the SYBR Green Master Mix
reagent (Applied Biosystems) and a 7700 Sequence
Detector System (Applied Biosystems). Relative Expression changes are calculated relative to B2M (B2Ms:
TGCTGTCTCCATGTTTGATGT ATCT and B2Mas:
TCTCTGCTCCCCACCTCTAAGT). The KRT23
expression was measured using the following oligonucleotide pairs: KRT23s: GAACTGGAGCGGCAGA ACA
and KRT23as: TTGATTCTTCCCGTGTCCCTT.

Results
Differential protein profiling of nuclear proteins from
Smad4 deficient and Smad4 re-expressing SW480 cells

Smad4 re-expressing SW480 cells served as a model system to investigate the effects of the tumor suppressor
Smad4 reconstitution on the nuclear protein composition of human colon carcinoma cells. Using 2D-DIGE
analysis, we compared nuclear protein fractions derived
from six independent replicates of Smad4 re-expressing
and Smad4 negative SW480 cells, respectively (Figure
1A-C). We generated 3 sample sets each, derived from
Cy3 labeled Smad4 re-expressing cell lysates and Cy5
labeled Smad4 negative cell lysates, whereas the second
sample set (again three lysates, each for Smad4 reexpressing and negative cells) was labeled vice versa to
minimize the identification of false positive protein
spots. On average about 2000 spots were detected per
gel. In the subsequent image analysis, using the DeCyder
software (GE Healthcare), a total of 17 spots were identified that show a reproducible differential expression
pattern. We considered intensity differences of factor

two and above as significant. These 17 differentially
expressed protein spots covered the entire pI and molecular weight range of the 2D-gels (Figure 1A). Of these
17 spots, 14 showed a higher and three a lower abundance in the nuclear fraction upon Smad4 re-expression.
The subsequent protein identification by MALDI-MS
revealed eight unique proteins (Table 1). The sequence
coverage of these proteins ranged from 12.6 - 60.2%
with Profound scores between 1.0 - 2.5 (1.3 being significant). The following proteins were found to be induced
upon Smad4 re-expression: tumor rejection antigen
(gp96), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein R,
eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1,
KRT23, KRT18 and Cyclophilin A. In contrast, the
amount of KRT8 and RbAp46 was found to be reduced
in the nuclear fraction.

the consequences of these changes have dramatic effects
on the morphology of the cells, we chose to study
KRT23 further. About this particular keratin very little
is known and our data clearly showed different expression levels in a Smad4-dependent context (Figure 1A,
Spot 10 and 11), i.e. a threefold up-regulation in Smad4
re-expressing cells (Figure 1B, C). Subsequent Northern
blot analysis of Smad4 re-expressing and negative
SW480 cells confirmed the Smad4-dependent up-regulation already at the transcription level (Figure 1D). Having identified and confirmed the proteome data of the
novel Smad4 target protein KRT23, we sought to identify protein interaction partners of this uncommon and
poorly characterized keratin as an initial step to gather
functional information for KRT23.

Protein Z domains. Due to the generally poor transfection efficiency of SW480 cells with standard plasmid
transfection strategies, we opted for retroviral gene
transfer to generate Smad4 negative and Smad4 reexpressing SW480 cells which stably express the transgenic TAP-KRT23 protein. This approach offered a
rapid and reliable means to purify native protein complexes and to identify the proteins by mass spectrometry
[34]. The successful expression of the TAP-KRT23 protein was monitored by Western blotting (data not
shown). In addition we analyzed the distribution of the
over-expressed TAP-KRT23 by confocal microscopy.
The immunofluorescence data revealed that the overexpressed protein is exclusively localized in the cytoplasm
and surrounding the nucleus. Furthermore we observed
a characteristic filamentous structure as expected for a
member of the keratin family (Figure 2A, B).

proteins correspond to typical keratin-associated proteins. Two protein bands of approximately 30 kD, which
were only detected in the Smad4 re-expressing cells,
were identified as 14-3-3ε and 14-3-3g, respectively.
Validation of Keratin 23-14-3-3ε-Interaction

To further investigate the Smad4-dependent interaction
between 14-3-3 and KRT23, we analyzed the endogenous

Tandem Affinity Purification of Keratin 23

KRT23 interaction partners were isolated following the
TAP-strategy. Therefore, KRT23 protein complexes from
Smad4 re-expressing and Smad4 negative cells were first
affinity purified using IgG-Sepharose prior to TEV cleavage, followed by a second affinity purification step using
immobilized ANTI-FLAG M2-Agarose. The FLAG eluates from the second purification step were separated by
SDS-PAGE and the proteins visualized by silver staining.
Five bands were present in both samples (Figure 2C,
Bands 1 - 4 and 6), whereas two protein bands were
unique to the Smad4 re-expressing cell line (Figure 2C,
Bands 7 and 8). All bands were excised and in-gel
digested with trypsin prior to analysis by nanoLC-MS/
MS (Table 2). We were able to verify that the common
bands contain the same set of proteins including, Plectin
isoform 11, HSP70, HSP60, KRT8, KRT18. These

expression of 14-3-3ε and 14-3-3g in Smad4 re-expressing
and Smad4 negative SW480 cells. The Western blot analysis showed that the expression of 14-3-3 proteins was
reduced in Smad4 negative SW480 cells, compared to
Smad4 re-expressing cells (Figure 3A). We chose to focus
on the 14-3-3ε isoform for further analysis, because 14-33g is known to form heterodimers with any other 14-3-3
family member whereas 14-3-3ε is only associated with
the 14-3-3g isoform. Using tagged proteins (Flag-KRT23
and VSV-G-14-3-3ε) in an immunoprecipitation experiment we were able to confirm our finding from the TAPassay showing that KRT23 is an interaction partner of 143-3ε (Figure 3B). Having confirmed that 14-3-3ε is a
KRT23 interaction partner, and taking into account previous findings by others showing that keratins
are important for nuclear redistribution of 14-3-3 proteins
[35,36], we went on to analyze whether KRT23 expression
is able to modulate the cellular distribution of 14-3-3ε or

Page 9 of 14

not. HEK 293T cells overexpressing VSV-G-14-3-3ε were
fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fraction and the
protein signal for VSV-G-14-3-3 could be recovered in
both fractions. The co-expression of Flag-KRT23 and
VSV-G-14-3-3 in turn lead to a decline of the VSV-G-143-3ε signal in the nuclear fraction, thus experimentally
supporting a model where KRT23 expression is indeed
influencing the cellular distribution of 14-3-3ε (Figure 3C).
Cellular distribution of 14-3-3ε in SW480 cells depends on
Keratin 23

Having shown a link between KRT23 expression and 143-3ε localization, we further hypothesized that Smad4
re-expression in our SW480 cell model system (also
shown to induce KRT23 expression) could have a similar effect on the endogenous cellular localization of 143-3ε. Indeed, confocal imaging revealed that in Smad4
re-expressing SW480 cells 14-3-3ε is more prominently

localized in the cytoplasm, whereas in Smad4 negative
cells (with a lower KRT23 expression level) 14-3-3ε
showed a pronounced nuclear localization (Figure 4A).
Next we wanted to test whether the Smad4 dependent
nuclear exclusion of 14-3-3ε could be rescued by
KRT23 knock-down experiments. The KRT23 expression was monitored by quantitative RT-PCR, because to
the best of our knowledge the direct monitoring of the
expression on the protein level is currently not possible
due to the lack of a specific antibody. KRT23 expression
was successfully reduced by both shRNA vector constructs; albeit to different levels depending on the

Page 10 of 14

KRT23 sequence targeted by the two different shRNA
vector constructs (Figure 4B). In line with the reduced
KRT23 expression following KRT23 knock-down, we
observed a partial rescue of the nuclear 14-3-3ε localization which became visible in the shRNA vector construct shKRT1010, showing also the best KRT23 knockdown efficiency (Figure 4A).

Discussion
Identification of potential Smad4 targets

In this study we aimed to identify and characterize
potential Smad4 target genes involved in colon

immunofluorescence images of SW480 cells. The cellular localization of 14-3-3ε was analyzed in Smad4 negative and Smad4 re-expressing
SW480 cells. KRT23 knock-down was achieved by stable overexpression of shKRT1010 in Smad4 re-expressing cells. The cells were double stained
with antibodies to 14-3-3ε (red) and the cytosolic marker tubulin (green). B) Validation of Keratin 23 knock-down efficiency. The Keratin 23
expression was monitored by quantitative RT-PCR in stably sh-KRT23 overexpressing SW480 cells as indicated. Each condition was measured in
triplicates and normalized to B2M.

carcinogenesis. In order to achieve this, we used our
previously described model system of Smad4 deficient
SW480 cells that re-express Smad4, thereby suppressing
in-vivo tumor formation and invasive potential of
SW480 cells [6]. Using high resolution 2D gel electrophoresis, we analyzed nuclear protein fractions from
Smad4 re-expressing and negative SW480 cells. The following MALDI-MS analysis of differentially expressed
protein spots revealed eight different proteins that can
be grouped according to their function in i) gene regulatory proteins (hnRNPR; RpAp46; eEFa), ii) stress proteins (gp96; cyclophilin A) and iii) keratins (KRT8;
KRT18 and KRT23). All of these proteins apart from
gp96 and the keratins are considered nuclear proteins,
whereas gp96 is an abundant protein located in the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Gp96 is the ER-paralog of
the cytosolic HSP90 with a role in housekeeping, i.e.
maintenance of protein homeostasis in the secretory
pathway [37]. The identification of an abundant ER protein is not surprising in this context because of the
architecture of the nuclear envelope (NE): The NE consists of two membrane systems, the outer and inner
nuclear membrane; the former being contiguous with
the rough ER. Thus, we expected in our nuclear fractions protein contaminations derived from ER proteins
as well as ribosomal proteins.
The observed presence of keratins in the nuclear fractions can be explained as a cytoplasmic contamination,
by direct interactions between the nuclear lamina and
cytosolic keratins [38] or by association of keratins with
the outer nuclear membrane protein nesprin-3 via the
cytoskeletal linker protein plectin [39]. The fact that our
TAP-experiment also identified plectin, suggests the
latter.
Smad4 modulates Keratin 23 expression

Following the 2D-DIGE analyses which identified the
altered expression of KRT23, we analyzed whether this
increased expression is transcriptionally or post-transcriptionally regulated. Based on the Northern blot analysis showing a good correlation of KRT23 transcript
and protein expression levels in SW480 cells (Figure
1D) it appears likely that KRT23 is mainly transcriptionally regulated. A subsequent test of eight human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines in which Smad4 expression
was reconstituted by a retroviral expression vector
revealed in three of the eight cell lines a similar Smad4dependent KRT23 up-regulation (U. Herbrand, unpublished observation), supporting the notion that KRT23
expression levels can be modulated in two major gastrointestinal tumor types directly or indirectly through
Smad4.
A connection between keratin expression and TGF-b
signaling was previously demonstrated in dominant-

Page 11 of 14

negative TGF-b type II receptor mice having elevated
K8/K18 protein levels [40]. In line with this mouse
model data we found that reconstitution of Smad4, a
key downstream component of the TGF-b signaling
pathway, lead to the down-regulation of KRT8. However, in our model we found that Smad4 reconstitution
increased in KRT18 expression.
In contrast to the increased KRT8/18 expression in
mice in the absence of functioning TGFb-signaling
Zhang et al. showed in a human pancreatic carcinoma
cell lines that sodium butyrate and trichostatin A treatment induces KRT23 expression at the mRNA level
[41]. This effect could be inhibited by RNAi-mediated
knock-down of p21 expression. Interestingly, Smad4
reconstitution in our SW480 model also led to a strong
up-regulation of p21 (I. Schwarte-Waldhoff, unpublished
observation). As p21 is a well described Smad4 target
involved in the TGFb-signaling pathway, these data
would support a model, where Smad4 and p21 are
upstream signaling components involved in the Smad4
dependent up-regulation of KRT23 described herein.
Clearly, more work will be needed in order to elucidate
the key proteins involved in our observed Smad4-dependend up-regulation of KRT23.
Bühler et al. recently reported that expression of
KRT18 caused an induction of adhesion proteins and a
regression of the malignant phenotype in KRT18 overexpressing breast carcinoma cells [42]. Smad4 loss is a
late event during tumor progression and correlates with
the development of a metastatic tumor in colon carcinogenesis [2,43], fitting well into a model where Smad4
induced expression of specific keratin types in colon
cells may help to maintain the cell to cell junctions
through desmosomes and hemidesmosomes and thus
supporting an epithelial phenotype. Our data hint
towards a model were Smad4 dependent KRT18 and
KRT23 up-regulation and KRT8 down-regulation mediates a tumor suppressor effect presumably by playing a
role in supporting the induction of the epithelial phenotype observed upon Smad4 reconstitution, which was
also accompanied by an up-regulation of the invasion
suppressor E-cadherin [32].
Keratin 23-14-3-3ε interaction is Smad4 dependent

Interestingly, Hesse et al. noted in a phylogenetic tree
analysis that KRT23 is an outstanding member of the
type I keratins localized on chromosome 17 [44]. These
data together with the increasing evidence that intermediate filaments are not only important as structural
proteins but are also involved in modulating and controlling cellular signaling processes and apoptosis mostly
through interaction with keratin associated proteins
(KAPs) prompted us to initiate a more detailed study of
KRT23 using the TAP methodology. Five of the seven

Liffers et al. BMC Cancer 2011, 11:137
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/11/137

identified KRT23 associated proteins (PLEC1, HSP70,
HSP60, KRT8 and KRT18) were found both in Smad4
re-expressing and negative cells. Both, the 14-3-3ε and g
proteins were only identified in the TAP eluate of
Smad4 re-expressing cells. However, we also found that
14-3-3ε and g protein expression levels are reduced in
Smad4 negative cells. Therefore, we hypothesis that this
reduced protein level was sufficient to prevent the
detection of 14-3-3 proteins by silver staining in our
TAP assay. Nevertheless we would also like to point out
that our data neither exclude nor clearly support the
alternative possibility that Smad4 is directly modulating
by any yet unknown mechanism KRT23-14-3-3 interaction. All of these proteins or their homologs have previously been shown to interact with other keratins [17],
indicating that our experimental conditions were appropriate to identify KAPs. Furthermore, they provide evidence that although KRT23 is more distant to other
KRT family members it is likely to share a number of
interaction properties described for other keratins.
Liao et al. showed that KRT18 is able to bind 14-3-3h,
ξ, and ε as well as HSP70. In their analyses KRT18-14-33 interaction was independent of HSP70 [45]. Ku et al.
reported that keratin-14-3-3ζ interaction is able to modulate the cellular distribution of 14-3-3 proteins [36]. Similarly, it has been shown that keratin 17, is rapidly induced
in wounded stratified epithelia and thus regulating cell
growth through binding to the adaptor protein 14-3-3s.
Furthermore, phosphorylation of KRT17 was important
for the redistribution of 14-3-3s from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm with concomitant stimulation of mTOR activity and cell growth [46]. These data prompted us to study
the influence of Smad4 reconstitution and thus induction
of KRT23 expression on the cellular distribution of 14-33ε in our model system.
Keratin 23 modulates the distribution of 14-3-3

By Western blot analysis we showed that 14-3-3ε requires
the presence of KRT23 for its cytoplasmic localization. In
addition, laser confocal microscopy showed that the reexpression of the tumor suppressor Smad4 led both to an
induction of KRT23 expression and cytoplasmic sequestration of 14-3-3ε. This cytoplasmic sequestration was partially released by KRT23 knock-down in Smad4 reexpressing cells. The close correlation between altering
keratin expression and changing of 14-3-3 distribution
was previously shown for hepatocytes [35]. In agreement
with the hypothesis of Tzivion et al. that intermediate filament proteins alter signaling pathways through 14-3-3
sequestration, it seems plausible that Smad4-dependent
up-regulation of KRT23 and/or KRT18 may have a similar
effect on 14-3-3 localization [47].
Margolis et al. provided evidence for a pivotal role of
keratins as potential drivers of mitotic entry of cells

Page 12 of 14

[48]. Due to the preferred binding of 14-3-3 to keratin
in the cytoplasm (designated by Margolis et al. as “the
14-3-3 sink”), the cytoplasmic availability of keratins and
its binding to 14-3-3 ensures that the 14-3-3 cargo proteins are released enabling them to control downstream
cellular processes. Furthermore, it has been shown that
14-3-3 is able to modulate cytoplasmic localization of
target proteins by directing them toward the CRM1mediated nuclear export pathway [26,49,50]. These data
together with our data are suggestive for a model where
KRT23-14-3-3 interaction can mediate the relocalization
of nuclear ligands by several mechanisms that ensure
cytoplasmic sequestration of the bound 14-3-3 complex.

Conclusions
In summary, we provide evidence that Smad4 is able to
induce either directly or indirectly KRT23 expression.
Furthermore, we were able to identify several novel
KRT23 interacting proteins among them 14-3-3ε and g.
Finally, we found that KRT23 expression in Smad4 reexpressing cells is able to cytoplasmic sequestration of
14-3-3ε. These findings together with the known signal
transduction modulator function of 14-3-3 family members suggests that our observed new regulatory circuit
of Smad4 dependent KRT23 up-regulation which in
turn modulates the cytoplasmic sequestration of 14-3-3
is a previously unknown facet of the tumor suppressive
response we observed upon Smad4 re-expression in our
colon cancer model. Therefore, it will be interesting to
determine in future experiments, which are the potential
proteins whose cellular localization and activity are
modulated by the Smad4 dependent KRT23 sequestration of the 14-3-3 complex to the cytoplasm in our
SW480 model system and what are their cellular functions in colon tumorigenesis.
