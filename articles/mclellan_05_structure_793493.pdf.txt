Abstract
Background: The pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (Psg) genes encode proteins of unknown function, and are
members of the carcinoembryonic antigen (Cea) gene family, which is a member of the immunoglobulin gene (Ig)
superfamily. In rodents and primates, but not in artiodactyls (even-toed ungulates / hoofed mammals), there have
been independent expansions of the Psg gene family, with all members expressed exclusively in placental
trophoblast cells. For the mouse Psg genes, we sought to determine the genomic organisation of the locus, the
expression profiles of the various family members, and the evolution of exon structure, to attempt to reconstruct
the evolutionary history of this locus, and to determine whether expansion of the gene family has been driven by
selection for increased gene dosage, or diversification of function.
Results: We collated the mouse Psg gene sequences currently in the public genome and expressed-sequence tag
(EST) databases and used systematic BLAST searches to generate complete sequences for all known mouse Psg
genes. We identified a novel family member, Psg31, which is similar to Psg30 but, uniquely amongst mouse Psg
genes, has a duplicated N1 domain. We also identified a novel splice variant of Psg16 (bCEA). We show that Psg24
and Psg30 / Psg31 have independently undergone expansion of N-domain number. By mapping BAC, YAC and
cosmid clones we described two clusters of Psg genes, which we linked and oriented using fluorescent in situ
hybridisation (FISH). Comparison of our Psg locus map with the public mouse genome database indicates good
agreement in overall structure and further elucidates gene order. Expression levels of Psg genes in placentas of
different developmental stages revealed dramatic differences in the developmental expression profile of individual
family members.
Conclusion: We have combined existing information, and provide new information concerning the evolution of
mouse Psg exon organization, the mouse Psg genomic locus structure, and the expression patterns of individual
Psg genes. This information will facilitate functional studies of this complex gene family.

Background
In mammalian pregnancy the interaction between the
maternal uterine tissues and foetal trophoblasts is regulated by a wide variety of cellular and endocrinological
mechanisms. These mechanisms underpin trophoblastic
invasion and remodelling of maternal tissues, placental
angiogenesis, and the modulation of maternal immune
responses. Central to these processes is the production by
trophoblast of a variety of hormones that are found in
abundance in the maternal bloodstream during pregnancy [1].
The pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSG) are the most
abundant foetal proteins in the maternal bloodstream in
late pregnancy [2]. They are synthesised in the syncytiotrophoblast of the human placenta and giant cells and
spongiotrophoblast in the rodent placenta [3-5]. The PSG
family of glycoproteins belongs to the carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA) family, which also includes the CEArelated adhesion molecules (CEACAMs). The CEA family
is itself part of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily [6].
The Ig domain structure of the human and rodent PSGs
differs. Containing both V-like Ig domains (N), C2-like Ig
domains (A and B) and relatively hydrophilic tails (C),
domain arrangements in human PSGs are type I (N-A1A2-B2-C), type IIa (N-A1-B2-C), type IIb (N-A2-B2-C),
type III (N-B2-C) and type IV (A1-B2-C) [7]. In contrast,
rodent PSGs are typically comprised of 3, and in a few
cases of 5 or 7 N-domains followed by an A-domain [8].
In the primate / rodent ancestor, the initial duplication of
the CEACAM / PSG primordial gene has been estimated to
have occurred about 90 Myr ago [9], approximately at the
time of human-rodent divergence. The most probable
PSG ancestor in rodents and primates is a CEACAM15like molecule based on the organisation of N and A
domains. CEACAM15 is not classified as a PSG because
comparisons of N and A domain sequence identity clearly
delineate members of the CEACAM and PSG subfamilies
(Roland Zebhauser, WZ, AM, TM, to be published elsewhere). It has been suggested that human and rodent PSG
multigene families evolved independently via further
gene duplication and exon shuffling events [10].
There are 11 members of the PSG family in humans that
are encoded by genes clustered on chromosome 19q13.2
[11,12]. PSG proteins have a similar domain structure to
the CEACAMs, but lack a membrane anchor and are therefore secreted. However, a few variants have been described
that are retained within the cell. Conversely, a small
number of human and mouse CEACAM variants lack a
membrane anchor and are secreted. Membrane-anchored
CEACAMs are widely expressed during embryonic development and in adult tissues, and are implicated in carcinogenesis, angiogenesis and regulation of immune
functions [13,14]. In contrast, PSGs and some CEACAMs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/4

are expressed almost exclusively in trophoblasts of the
haemochorial placenta of rodents and primates [4,5,15].
The biochemical properties and physiological functions
of the PSGs remain to be fully elucidated, although functional experiments and clinical observations are beginning to provide some clues. Low PSG levels in the
maternal circulation are associated with threatened abortions, intrauterine growth retardation and foetal hypoxia
[16-19]. The importance of PSGs for the maintenance of
pregnancy is also underlined by the observation that the
application of anti-PSG antibodies or vaccination with
PSG induces abortion in mice and monkeys, respectively,
and reduces the fertility of non-pregnant monkeys
[20,21]. The majority of PSG functional studies have
focussed on determining whether PSGs are able to modulate the maternal immune system to prevent rejection of
the allotypic foetus. Early studies with complex PSG mixtures isolated from placenta indicated an inhibitory effect
on phytohaemagglutinin or allogeneically stimulated
lymphocytes [22,23]. In further experiments it was shown
that human monocytes secreted anti-inflammatory
cytokines in response to PSG exposure. Moreover, recombinant mouse PSG18 was found to induce the production
of interleukin (IL)-10 in the mouse macrophage cell line
RAW 264.7 [24]. Human PSG1, PSG6 and PSG11 all
induced secretion of IL-10, IL-6 and transforming growth
factor (TGF)-β1 [25]. Whilst IL-10 and TGF-β1 are antiinflammatory [26], IL-6 is usually considered to be a
proinflammatory cytokine. However IL-6 does have some
well-described anti-inflammatory properties [27]. Furthermore, IL-6 has been shown to indirectly promote trophoblast growth by upregulation of human chorionic
gonadotropin (hCG) release by the trophoblast, and
induction of granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating
factor (GM-CSF) [28,29]. Further evidence implicating
PSGs in immune modulation arises from PSG mediated
suppression of T cells in purulent septic complications of
abortion [30] and elevated circulating PSG levels are correlated with improved symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis
[31]. PSG induction of alternative monocyte activation is
of particular importance as it implies a PSG-mediated
switching of the immune system from a predominantly
TH1 response to a predominately TH2 response which is
more compatible with a successful pregnancy [32].
The only PSG receptor identified to date is the integrinassociated CD9 receptor, which was found to bind the N1
domain of both PSG17 [33] and PSG19 (unpublished
data). Additionally, the presence of the conserved tripeptide motif Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) on a solvent-exposed loop
in the N-terminal Ig domain in the majority of human
and some lower-primate PSGs implicates a function that
involves integrin-related receptors [34]. Thus it has been
speculated that the RGD domain may enable some PSGs

Page 2 of 17

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:4

to disrupt cell-matrix interactions [35]. However, no
rodent PSG isolated to date possesses an RGD domain.
Evidence supporting the hypothesis that the RGD domain
may be involved in receptor binding was provided by the
discovery that a peptide containing the RGD motif, from
human PSG9, bound to a receptor on the surface of a
promonocytic cell line [36]. In common with integrin
interactions, this was dependent on the presence of divalent cations and showed sensitivity to cytoskeletal signalling. However, the expected sizes of the receptor subunits
differed from those of known integrins, therefore, the
identity of the receptor remains elusive.
Much current work has focussed on human PSGs due to
their possible relevance to disorders of pregnancy. However, the study of rodent PSGs is important because, the
evident differences between primate and rodent PSG protein domain structures notwithstanding, there appears to
be considerable conservation in terms of expression in
trophoblast, independent gene family expansions in
mammalian lineages with haemochorial placentation,
and postulated immune functions during pregnancy.
Moreover, the application of gene targeting and mutagenesis in the mouse is likely to be informative with respect
to elucidating the cellular and physiological functions of
PSGs. Such experiments will require an accurate genomic
map of the mouse Psg locus, which we undertook to produce in the work described herein. It is also pertinent to
ask whether the independent expansions of PSG gene
families in different mammalian lineages reflect selection
for increased gene dosage or for diversification of function
mediated through different protein structures or developmental expression patterns. We therefore undertook to
examine and correlate protein domain evolution and
expression profiles of the various mouse Psg genes to
attempt to address this question. Our results suggest that
different family members have very different expression
levels at different stages of development, which we consider may be supportive of the hypothesis that mouse Psg
genes may have evolved divergent functions in mammalian pregnancy. However, mutagenesis of individual family members will be necessary to rigorously test this
hypothesis.

Results
Identification of novel mouse Psg genes
For comparative studies of the human PSG family it is relatively easy to compare coding sequences (CDS) and peptide sequences because complete sequence information is
available. However the data available for mouse PSGs is
not complete, making such analyses difficult. Thus, we
firstly collated the currently available public data, and we
then attempted to identify sequences for PSGs that were
not completely resolved in the databases. Full-length
cDNA sequences of Psg17, Psg18, Psg19, Psg21, Psg23,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/4

Psg28 and Psg30 were identified via basic name searches of
the RefSeq RNA database. Their identity was then verified
by comparison to cDNA fragment sequences, which were
obtained during the course of this work and deposited in
GenBank [37], as misnaming of genes is commonplace in
the databases. The cDNA sequence of Psg22 was then
identified via BLAST analysis of the mouse RefSeq RNA
database using the GenBank partial sequence referenced
in Beauchemin et al. [37]. Psg31 was identified by BLAST
analysis of the same database using the full-length Psg30
sequence and found to be the XM_355864.1 predicted
transcript. However, there was a discrepancy between the
predicted transcript and the sequences of EST clones
CK032208 and CN694284. Comparison of these EST
sequences with genomic contig NT_039395.2, using pairwise BLAST analysis, revealed that there had been a duplication of the N1 domain exon. We refer to the two N1
domains of Psg31 as N1 and N1* hereafter.
The gene and full-length cDNA coding sequences of the
remaining mouse genes (Psg20, Psg24, Psg25, Psg26, Psg27
and Psg29) were deduced manually by systematic BLAST
analysis of the mouse genome database as described in
Methods. None of these predicted cDNAs were observed
in the mouse EST database, although all except Psg20 were
observed in the Trace Archive EST sequences. A novel
splice variant of Psg16 was also found. BLAST analysis of
the mouse High Throughput Genomic Sequences (HTGS)
database identified contig AC148976.2, which appears to
contain the whole Psg16 gene. An alternative exon 1 was
discovered upstream of the previously described initiating
exon by a pairwise BLAST comparison of this contig with
full-length Psg17 coding sequence. The use of this alternative exon 1 produced a transcript that encodes a typical
PSG polypeptide complete with a predicted secretory-peptide signal sequence and cleavage site. Multiple hits identified from subsequent BLAST analysis of the mouse EST
and Trace Archives EST databases provided evidence that
this novel splice variant was placentally expressed in vivo.
In contrast, only one hit was obtained by identical analysis using the coding sequence of the brain-specific transcript described in Chen et al. [38]. This transcript
(BC030357) was derived from a retinal cDNA library. The
brain-expressed splice variant is generated from an alternative initiation site within exon 2 of the dominant placentally-expressed form of the gene. Alternative promoter
usage would explain the brain and placenta-specific
expression patterns of these variants of Psg16. Unlike the
brain-specific variant, the placentally-expressed variant
possesses a predicted secretory signal peptide at the N-terminus, like most other Psg gene family members.
The comparison of the brain derived Psg16 coding
sequence with the genomic sequence (AC148976.2) also
revealed differences in the encoding of the A-domain. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/4

placental transcript is predicted to be encoded by 5 exons,
as are the majority of mouse Psg mRNAs. However, a weak
splice donor signal sequence within the fifth exon permits
splicing to a strong splice acceptor sequence downstream
of the sixth exon, as seen in the brain-expressed transcript.
Trace Archive EST data reveals multiple hits to sequences
from placental cDNA libraries using the 3' end of the placental Psg16 coding sequence as bait. This confirms the
existence of our predicted transcript. Conversely, similar
analysis using the brain-expressed variant yielded no hits.
The sixth exon is present on a separate randomly ordered
gene fragment within the AC148976.2 contig.

IgV-like domains. An unrooted phylogenetic tree indicates three main branches of IgV-like domain evolution
(Fig. 2). There is a group consisting of N1 domains, a
group of N2 domains and N2-derived domains, and a
group of N3 domains and N3-derived domains. Therefore, in agreement with the most common structure
observed in Fig. 1, the ancestral mouse Psg would be
expected to have had an N1-N2-N3-A arrangement of
domains. The expansion of Psg24, Psg30 and Psg31 has
occurred mostly through duplications of the N2 and N3
IgV-like domains, with the exception of Psg24 N5 and
Psg31 N1 domains.

Psg-ps1 was previously considered to be a pseudogene,
based on a point deletion at nucleotide position 30,
downstream from the canonical Psg translational start site
[8]. However, despite this frame shift, the open reading
frame of this unusual Psg continues 105 bp upstream of
the site of the mutation to an alternative ATG. Inspection
of the sequence revealed a Kozak consensus, and BLAST
analysis of the public EST and Trace Archive EST databases
yielded many mRNA clones that contain this region in
addition to downstream exons. Hence, this gene is clearly
expressed, and we now propose to rename Psg-ps1 as
Psg32 hereafter. We note that this mutation and amino
terminal extension abolishes the canonical PSG secretory
signal and peptide cleavage site. We therefore suggest that
if Psg32 is indeed translated, the resulting protein is
retained within the cytoplasm. To determine if the deletion observed in BALB/c mice was also present in other
murine strains, we amplified and sequenced a 146 bp
fragment by PCR using a set of primers specific for the 5'untranslated region and the leader peptide of Psg32. The
deletion observed in the Psg32 cDNA is also present in the
genomic DNA of A/J, C57BL6/J, YBR/Ei, and SWR/J
inbred mouse strains (data not shown).

In order to characterise the evolution of the mouse Psgs
with expanded domain numbers, Neighbor-Joining (NJ)
trees with bootstrap values of 1000 were prepared (Fig.
3A) and ClustalW amino acid sequence alignments (Fig.
3B) were studied to identify the origin of the novel IgVlike domains in these three exceptional Psgs. From examination of the data in Fig. 3A(i) it was not apparent from
which progenitor domain the Psg24 N5 domain evolved
due to lack of confidence in the branch on which it lies.
However, using the alignment identities in Fig. 3B(i) it
can be seen that, although generally poorly conserved, the
best match of 51.2% was obtained by alignment with the
N2 domain. Therefore, our evolutionary model assumes
that the Psg24 N5 domain arose from an early duplication
of the N2 domain. Also, based on agreement of the data
in Fig. 3A(i) and 3B(i), the N2 domain duplicated again
more recently to yield the N3 domain. This latter duplication explains why the Psg24 N4 domain is N3-like. The
order of these events is shown schematically in Fig. 3C(i).

The nomenclature (past and current) and accession numbers of nucleotide sequences of all the murine PSGs are
documented in Table 1. The genome sequence and predicted CDS and translation products for Psg16, Psg20,
Psg26 and Psg31 are listed in Additional file 1. The complete CDS data for all known mouse Psgs (except the
brain-specific splice variant of Psg16) are listed in Additional file 2. The complete protein primary sequences for
all known mouse Psgs (except the brain-specific splice variant of Psg16) are listed in Additional file 3.

Using a similar analysis we propose a model for the
expansion of domains within Psg30 and Psg31 (Fig.
3C(ii)). We suggest that the N4 and N6 domains of Psg30
and Psg31 are derived from a progenitor N2 domain. Similarly, the N5 and N7 domains are derived from a progenitor N3 domain. Expansion is predicted to have occurred
in 2 or 3 separate events in a common ancestor of Psg30
and Psg31. In the first instance the progenitor N3-like and
N2-like domains were duplicated, either at different
points in evolution or at the same time. The final step was
a duplication of both of these daughter domains to create
Psg30 and the precursor of Psg31. The precursor of Psg31
then underwent another duplication, this time of the N1
domain.

Domain structure of mouse PSG proteins
A schematic representation of the mouse Psg domain
structures is shown in Fig. 1. Of the seventeen mouse Psgs,
thirteen encode a common structure of three Ig variable
(IgV)-like domains (N-domains) and a single Ig constant
(IgC)-like domain (A-domain). Psg24, Psg30 and Psg31
have an expanded structure created by the duplication of

Expression of Psg genes in mouse placenta at different
developmental stages
On the basis that all mouse Psg genes originated from a
common ancestor, and expanded into a multigene family
by duplication and subsequent divergence, the question
as to whether the expression patterns have also diversified
is relevant to determining the selective forces underlying

Psg gene family expansion. As Psg genes are expressed predominantly in the placenta, cDNA was prepared from
total RNA extracted from mouse placenta at four stages of
development between E10.5 and E17.5. Psg cDNA
sequences were then amplified with PCR primers
designed to amplify Psg16 – Psg29 inclusive. Size fractionation of PCR products on an ethidium bromide-stained
agarose gel, indicates that mouse Psg genes are predominantly expressed from around E15.5, increasing in expression through to at least E17.5 (Fig. 4). However, after
blotting the products onto nylon membranes and hybridising radiolabelled oligonucleotide probes specific for
individual Psg genes (Table 2), we observed significant
differences in expression profiles of different genes during
development. This method is probably semi-quantitative
at best but does give some indication of relative expression levels. We observed that Psg16 and Psg26 are weakly
expressed at E15.5 but strongly expressed at E17.5. In contrast, Psg17, Psg18, Psg21 and Psg23 are expressed strongly

at E15.5, further increasing by E17.5. Psg27 shows a similar expression pattern to these four Psgs, but at a relatively
low level. Very weak expression was observed on E17.5 for
Psg19, Psg20, Psg24, Psg25 and Psg29, whereas Psg22 and
Psg28 were undetectable. Psg30, Psg31 and Psg32 domain
structures had not been finalised and therefore their
expression was not analysed in this experiment.
To supplement the PCR-based Psg expression studies, we
performed 'virtual northern' analysis in silico by screening
the public EST database for sequences matching Psg N1 or
A-domains and counting the numbers of matches (Fig. 5).
There was generally good concordance of the virtual data
with the RT-PCR data; notably, Psg21 and Psg23 are highly
represented in both datasets. However, disagreements
were also evident e.g. Psg16 expression was low in the RTPCR data, but high in the virtual data. A random sample
of twenty of the large number of Psg16 EST sequences in
the database indicated that all were of placental origin,

The relative position of potential N-glycosylation sites (consensus amino acid sequence: asparagine-X-threonine / serine; X any
amino acid except proline) were identified using the NetNGlyc 1.0 Server online software http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/
NetNGlyc/ and indicated by lollipops. Although PSG32 is probably not routed through the endoplasmic reticulum, the putative
N-glycosylation sites are shown for comparison. Of the two PSG16 splice variants, only the variant expressed in the placenta is
shown.

ruling out contamination with brain-derived sequences as
an explanation for the disparity between RT-PCR and virtual analysis. There was also generally good agreement
with the results from screening the EST database with N1
and A domain sequences, although the numbers of Adomain hits were 4–5 fold lower than the N1-domain
hits. The only exception to this observation was that Psg30
and Psg31 sequences were identified in 2-fold greater
abundance when screened with the A domain compared
with the N1 domain. Despite some discrepancies, therefore, the combined RT-PCR and virtual Northern data

demonstrate that developmental onset of expression, and
maximum expression levels, vary considerably within the
Psg family.
Mouse Psg locus genomic organisation
The published mouse Psg gene locus is contained on contig NT_039395. However, the complement of Psg genes is
incomplete and the majority of gene sequences within the
contig are unordered. We therefore decided to determine
the organisation of Psg genes within the locus by screening
BAC, YAC and cosmid clones using hybridisation with

Expression of Psg mRNAs during placental development. Total RNA (1 µg) from day 10.5, 12.5, 15.5 and 17.5 BALB/c
placentae was reverse transcribed using an oligo (dT) oligonucleotide (reverse PCR primer). After addition of the degenerate
Psg-all oligonucleotide (forward PCR primer), which anneals to the cDNA of all known members of the mouse Psg family, Psg
cDNAs were amplified by PCR (see schematic diagram depicting generalised mouse Psg cDNA amplification). Aliquots were
size-separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. a, PCR products were visualised by ethidium bromide staining. b-o, the amplification products were blotted onto nylon membranes and individual blots were hybridised with single gene-specific 32P-labelled
oligonucleotides from the N1 domain regions (Table 2). The location of the primers used for amplification of the Psg cDNAs
and the region from which the sequences of the gene-specific oligonucleotides were derived are shown together with a schematic representation of mouse Psg mRNA. The 5'- and 3'-untranslated regions are shown as bold lines. L, leader; N1-N3, IgVlike domains; A, IgC-like domain.

between the relative positions of the Psg genes at the locus
and their domain arrangements or expression patterns.

There is a discrepancy with respect to the distance between
the two subclusters. The currently poorly resolved data
covering this region in the the Ensembl assembly implies
the presence of a gap between Psg29 and Psg32. However,

meric) is about 460 kb long and contains only two Psg
genes which indicates the presence of a non-Psg genomic
region. We estimate the gap between the subclusters to be
approximately 400 kb based on the size of cosmids containing two Psg genes (ca. 40 kb).

Discussion
The human PSG genomic data in the public databases are
relatively complete. For each PSG gene, there are annotated RefSeq resources comprising information on
genomic structure, transcripts and translation products.
The nomenclature is also standardised [37]. Further, there
are accurate chromosome 19 locus assignments allowing
complete visualisation of the PSG locus and surrounding
genes. In contrast, a substantial quantity of mouse Psg
genomic data in the public domain is fragmented, incomplete and somewhat unreliable. We sought to collate the
existing genomic data, to present novel data to fill in gaps,
and to provide a coherent resource of mouse Psg genomic
data.
To determine whether the existing set of mouse Psg genes
was complete we performed systematic BLAST searches of

a variety of public DNA sequence databases. This analysis
revealed the existence of a novel expressed Psg gene, which
we name Psg31 in line with the accepted nomenclature
convention [37]. Psg31 apparently evolved from a duplication of the whole of the Psg30 gene followed by a subsequent internal duplication of the N1 domain. We were
also able to predict the complete coding sequences of four
Psg genes for which previously only partial fragments were
described. The gene, CDS and protein sequences of these
predictions, coupled with a complete reference of all
known mouse Psg CDS and primary protein sequences are
provided in three attached Additional Files.
Using the full CDS information obtained for the complete
set of mouse Psg gene sequences, domain structures for all
family members were predicted. All of the PSG proteins
possess previously described arrangements of Ig-like
domains. Except for two members, discussed below, all
are predicted to encode N-terminal secretory signal
sequences. Our predicted novel splice variant of Psg16 has
a complete N1 domain and secretory signal peptide
sequence. Trace Archive EST database BLAST analysis confirmed that this variant is expressed in the placenta. In

FigureNorthern analysis of the mouse Psg genes
Virtual 5
Virtual Northern analysis of the mouse Psg genes. The nucleotide sequences of the Psg exons encoding the N1 or the A
domains were used in NCBI-BLAST searches of the GenBank mouse EST database (March 16, 2004) for the presence of Psg
transcripts (virtual Northern analysis). A hit was registered when a 100% match for a sequence > 150 bp was observed. Obvious mismatches such as unidentified nucleotides (N) or single nucleotide insertions or deletions (especially at the end of a
sequence run) were ignored.

contrast, the brain-expressed variant [38] has only a partial N1 domain and no secretory signal peptide. The previously described Psg-ps1 pseudogene [8] was found to be
expressed in the placenta using Trace Archive EST database BLAST analysis and possesses an excellent Kozak
sequence at the predicted translational initiation site. This
evidence therefore indicates that this gene, which we
rename Psg32, is not a pseudogene but a bona fide
expressed Psg gene family member. The Psg32 transcript
may encode a protein that is retained within the cytoplasm. We note that a precedent in the human exists in the
form of a non-secreted splice variant of PSG11 [7].

Psg31 has the unusual N1-N1*-N2-N3-N4-N5-N6-N7-A
domain structure. This newly characterised Psg gene has
evolved from a duplication of the entire Psg30 gene followed by an internal duplication of the N1 domain. There
may be functional significance associated with the N1
domain duplication. The complex nature of Psg gene evolution, including putative gene conversion and recombination events between family members [34], makes it
difficult to analyse their evolution. Despite this, the data
generated from ClustalX alignments and NJ trees enabled
us to generate trees that allow prediction of the order of
events of domain duplications in Psg24, Psg30 and Psg31.
We note that the apparent route to domain number

on overlapping cosmid, BAC and YAC clones. The position of Psgs represented by filled boxes is unequivocal, whereas the
position of those represented by open boxes is ambiguous. Arrows between pairs of genes indicate that their order remains
unresolved. The distances between individual genes are not shown to scale. Chimeric YACs mapping to separate chromosomes are indicated by stippled and solid lines. The solid lines correspond to chromosome 7 regions containing the Psg genes
indicated above. The locations of the non-chromosome 7 regions are not known. Only the sizes of non-chimeric YACs have

expansion differed between Psg24, and Psg30 and Psg31.
The extra N-domains of Psg24 are derived from two duplications of the N2 domain. However, for Psg30 and Psg31,

independent duplications of each of the N2 and N3
domains were probably followed by a secondary duplication of the daughter domains, possibly as a single event.

Gene expression data from RT-PCR of placental RNA and
EST database analysis revealed considerable differences in
the expression levels of different Psg genes. In this analysis
Psg21 and Psg23 were the most abundant, consistent with
a previous report of abundant Psg23 expression [39].
Whilst there was generally good agreement between the
two methods of expression analysis we cannot determine,
based on current data, whether Psg gene expression differences reflect selection for divergent functions, or increased
gene dosage for enhancement of an existing function,
because expression levels were uniformly low for many
family members, and there was a general trend of
increased expression during gestation. Psg transcripts are
found from day 6.5 of embryonic development onward in
primary trophoblast giant cells, later (from day 10.5) in
spongiotrophoblast cells and, to a lesser extent, in a cell
population in the deciduas basalis at day 14.5 [40]. At
present, it is unclear whether the various Psg genes exhibit
different cellular expression patterns, which might indicate divergent functions of the various PSGs. There are
interesting parallels between the expansion of the Psg
gene family and similar expansions of other placentallyexpressed gene families such as the prolactin and growth
hormone families [1], and the aspartic and cysteine proteases [41]. Such duplications may be a manifestation of
parent-offspring conflict or inter-sibling rivalry over
maternal investment [42].
Having collated all known mouse Psg gene protein coding
sequences and protein domain structures, the mouse Psg
genomic locus on chromosome 7 remained to be determined to complete a comprehensive resource for the
analysis of Psg function. The NCBI build 32 composite
mouse assembly data revealed that only four Psgs had
been mapped. Other Psgs on contig NT_039395 are currently unordered. We therefore screened cosmid, YAC and
BAC libraries, and orientated Psg-containing clones to
identify, where possible, the order of Psg genes within the
locus. We were not able to resolve all ambiguities in gene
order on our map; however, where public database information is available, our data are in good agreement. We
found no clear relationship between gene location and
gene expression level suggesting that, within the Psg locus,
each Psg gene is autonomously regulated.

Conclusions
The evolution and physiological functions of the relatively understudied mouse Psg gene family are poorly
understood. This is a feature shared with other placentally-expressed, multigene families such as the prolactin
and growth hormone genes [1]. In order to provide a comprehensive resource to facilitate functional studies of
mouse Psg genes, including the generation of mouse
mutants with modified Psg gene expression profiles, we
have collated the entire set of mouse Psg genes, their pre-

The complete CDS data will enable the cloning, overexpression, and gene targeting of individual or multiple
mouse Psg genes. This will facilitate the elucidation of
their function and, by extrapolation, their human homologues, which may be involved in diseases of pregnancy.

Methods
Isolation of cosmid, YAC and BAC clones
Cosmid libraries in pWE15 which were made from liver
DNA of BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were obtained from
Dr. Edwin N. Geissler, Boston, MA, USA, and Stratagene
(Heidelberg, Germany), respectively. They were screened
for the presence of Psg gene-containing cosmids using a
32P-labelled, full-length Psg cDNA (2.1 kb KpnI/XbaI fragment of pCea2b [8]) as a probe. The final wash was in 4x
NaCl/Cit (1x NaCl/Cit is 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium
citrate pH 7.0), 0.1% SDS at 65°C. Psg gene-containing
YAC clones were identified by hybridisation of DNA from
YAC clones which were spotted at high density onto nylon
membranes [43] with the same Psg cDNA probe under
medium stringency conditions with a final wash in 4x
SSPE (1x SSPE is 180 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate pH7.4, 1 mM EDTA), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS) at 65°C. The membranes with arrayed YAC clone
DNAs were kindly provided by Dr. H. Lehrach, MaxPlanck-Institut für Molekulare Genetik, Berlin. Two libraries were screened, 902 and 903, both in the vector pYAC4
[44] composed of 9216 clones each, containing spleen
DNA of C3H and C57BL/6 mice, respectively. Filters with
arrayed BAC clones containing genomic DNA from the
embryonic stem cell line CJ7 (129/Sv strain) (CloneRanger™ BAC Human CTC, Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) were screened by hybridisation with a 32P-labelled
probe consisting of the N1 domain exon sequences of 14
mouse Psg genes (Psg17–Psg29 and Psg32). The N1
domain exons were amplified individually by PCR using
the degenerate primer pair PsgN1-F/PsgN1-R or Psg32N1F/PsgN1-R (4 mM each) for Psg32 (Table 2) and cosmid
clones (10 ng) with individual Psg genes as template in
the presence of 1 U Taq polymerase and 4 mM MgCl2 in a
total volume of 30 ml (annealing: 50°C, 30 s). N1 exons
of Psg28 and Psg29 were released by digestion with SalI
and KpnI from pUC18 (see below).
Southern blot analysis of cosmid and YAC DNAs
DNA from YAC clones was isolated by CsCl equilibrium
density gradient centrifugation in the presence of ethidium bromide, essentially as described [45], except that
spheroblast formation was achieved by incubation for 90
min with 0.17 mg/ml lyticase (approx. 6,000 U/mg) from
Arthrobacter luteus (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany). Two
mg of cosmid or 0.5 mg of YAC DNA were digested with
restriction endonucleases, size fractionated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels and blotted onto positively

charged nylon membranes. To identify N1 and A domain
exon-containing DNA fragments, the digested DNAs on
the membranes were hybridised with 32P-labelled N1
(cosmid DNA blots only) and A domain probes from
Psg17 and washed under medium stringency conditions
(4x SSPE, 0.1% SDS, 65°C). The Psg17 N1 and A domain
cDNA fragments used as probes were obtained by PCR
(denaturation: 94°C, 15 s; extension: 72°C, 3 min; 30
cycles) using the mPsg-5'/mPsg-3' (annealing: 50°C; 30s)
and Psg17A5'/Psg17A3' (annealing: 60°C, 30 s), primer
pairs respectively, and the Psg17 cDNA clone pCea2b as
template (Table 2; [8]).
Identification of new Psg genes from YAC clones
N1 exons from unknown Psg genes were amplified by PCR
(annealing: 52°C, 30 s; 30 cycles) in a total volume of 100
µl using 200 ng of YAC clone DNA as template, 1 U Taq
polymerase, 3 mM MgCl2 and 4 mM each of PsgN1-F and
PsgN1-R degenerate oligonucleotides (Table 2) which
bind to the N1, but not N2 and N3 exons of all known
mouse Psg genes (except Psg32). The product was purified
by electrophoresis on a 1.8% agarose gel and subcloned
into pUC18 after blunt-ending (SureClone ligation kit:
Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). The N1 exons from two
of the 10 newly identified Psg genes (Psg28, Psg29) were
analysed by sequencing recombinant plasmids which did
not hybridise with oligonucleotide probes specific for
known Psg genes (Table 2).
Mapping of the Psg locus
The presence of the different Psg genes within YAC, BAC
and cosmid clones was first determined by PCR followed
by hybridisation with oligonucleotides specific for individual Psg genes. DNA from Psg-containing YAC (100 ng)
and cosmid clones (10 ng) were used to amplify the N1
domain exons of all known Psg genes in a total volume of
60 µl as described above. The N1 exon of Psg32 was amplified in a separate reaction using Psg32N1-F and PsgN1-R
(Table 2) as primers under the same conditions used for
the amplification of the other N1 exons. For the analysis
of BAC clones, PCR was performed directly from the BACcontaining bacterial clones according to the supplier's
protocol. Aliquots (3.5 µl) from the various PCR reactions
were alkali-denatured, dot-blotted onto nitrocellulose
and hybridised with individual 32P-labelled (final
concentration: 0.3–1.2 × 106 dpm/ml), gene-specific oligonucleotides (Table 2) in 0.5 M sodium phosphate pH
7.2, 7% SDS, 1 mM EDTA over night at 40°C. The filters
were washed twice for 20 min each in 2x SSPE at room
temperature, followed by two washes in 6x SSPE, 0.1%
SDS at a temperature 4°C below the calculated melting
temperature of the hybrids [46]. Oligonucleotides containing at least 3 mismatches in comparison with the corresponding sequences of all known Psg and Cea subgroup
members were designed using the computer program

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/4

Primer [47]. The only exception is the Psg19-specific oligonucleotide which exhibits only 2 mismatches to the Psg22
sequence. However, the stringency of the post-hybridisation washes only allowed binding of oligonucleotides
with a maximum of one mismatch. The specificity of the
oligonucleotides and the hybridisation conditions was
demonstrated on cosmid DNAs containing individual Psg
genes. The identity of the Psg genes was verified by
sequencing. No cross-hybridisation with other Psg genes
was observed. The size of the YACs was determined by
pulsed field gel electrophoresis followed by Southern blot
hybridisation with the Psg17 cDNA clone pCea2b (see
above) essentially as described previously [48].
Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analyses
The chromosomal location and chimerism of YAC clones
were determined by FISH analyses, using B1-PCR of YAC
DNA for probe preparation essentially as described [49].
Orientation and order relative to the chromosome 7 centromere and to each other of the two Psg gene subclusters
was defined by FISH analysis using probes described in
Fig. 6. FISH was performed essentially as described [50]
on m5S cells [51] and concanavalin A-stimulated lymphocytes [52] from the C57BL/6CrS1c mouse strain.
RNA isolation, RT-PCR and specific detection of Psg
cDNAs
BALB/c mice were mated overnight, and the next day
plugged females were designated as day 0.5 of gestation.
Pregnant females were killed by cervical dislocation and
placentae were dissected free of maternal tissue, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70°C. Total
RNA was extracted by the acid phenol method [53]. The
expression of individual Psg genes was studied by RT-PCR
followed by hybridisation of the products with gene-specific oligonucleotides. Total RNA (1 µg) from placentae of
different gestational stages was reverse transcribed in a
total volume of 10 µl by avian myoblastosis virus (AMV)
reverse transcriptase (Promega, Mannheim, Germany) in
the presence of 6 U/µl RNasin (Promega) using a degenerate oligo (dT)30 oligonucleotide (1 µM) as primer (Table
2). The reaction mix was adjusted to 1x Taq buffer (20 mM
Tris-Cl, 16 mM (NH4)2SO4, pH 8.6), 3 mM MgCl2 and 0.4
mM dNTPs in a total volume of 100 µl. Amplification of
all known Psg cDNAs (except for the cDNA of Psg32
(Cea6), which at the time of the experiment was presumed
to be a pseudogene [8]) was achieved by PCR (denaturation: 94°C, 15 s; annealing: 58°C, 30 s; extension: 72°C,
3 min; 30 cycles) using Taq polymerase after addition of
400 pmoles of Psg-all (Table 2) and 50 pmoles of the
oligo (dT) oligonucleotide as 5'- and 3'-primer, respectively. Ten µl aliquots each were size fractionated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel, blotted onto a positively
charged nylon membrane (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) and hybridised with individual 32P-

described above.

oligonucleotide, Psg32-exon 1, which binds to a sequence
internal to the PCR primers were sequenced.

DNA sequence determination
Nucleotide sequences were determined on both strands
with flanking universal and internal oligonucleotides as
primers using a T7 polymerase sequencing kit
(Pharmacia) or a Taq Dye Deoxyterminator cycle sequencing kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

Authors' contributions

Assessment of availability of full-length mouse Psg
sequences in the public databases
All bioinformatics searches described below used the
online software and databases available at the NCBI http:/
/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. Where fully annotated, Psg
cDNA sequences were identified by name searches of the
RefSeq RNA database. Attempts were then made to identify remaining known Psg cDNA sequences via BLAST
analyses of the mouse RefSeq RNA database using the
GenBank partial-sequences referenced in [37]. Any PSG
cDNA sequences that could still not be identified by this
method were determined by BLAST analysis of the mouse
genome database using known fragments of the sequence
to be determined. This identified genomic contigs that
could be interrogated for the 'missing' exonic sequences
by pairwise BLAST analysis using the Psg17 cDNA
sequence, or fragments thereof, as a probe. A similar procedure was applied to situations where the existence of
alternatively spliced exons was suspected to reside within
in a Psg gene-containing contig. In the cases where Psg
mRNA sequences were built from genomic sequence, or
splice variants were predicted, evidence for the existence
of such mRNA species in vivo was tested by BLAST analysis
using the mouse EST and Trace Archive EST databases.
Bioinformatic analysis of the mouse PSG Ig domains
The coding sequences of the PSG domains were aligned
using Clustal X [54]. For the production of rooted neighbour-joining (NJ) evolutionary trees, alignments were
bootstrapped 1000 times. Evolutionary trees were constructed from the alignments using TreeView http://taxon
omy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html.
Analysis of the Psg32 exon 1 sequence
Four hundred nanograms of DNA obtained from four
inbred mouse strains (A/J, C57BL6/6J, YBR/Ei, and SWR/
J) (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, USA) were
amplified using the oligonucleotide primers 5'-AAGGAAGGACAGCAAAT and 5'- AGCTGTGAGCAGAAGAC
(denaturation: 94°C, 30 s; annealing: 50°C, 30 s; extension: 72°C, 30 s; 30 cycles) with Pfu DNA polymerase
(Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions.
The 146 bp PCR products were subcloned into PCR-Script
(Stratagene). Clones that hybridized to a Psg32-specific

ASM performed bioinformatics relating to Psg locus
organisation, phylogenetic analyses, Psg expression studies, and drafted the manuscript. BF characterized Psg
genomic clones and performed Psg expression studies. GD
isolated the Psg BAC clones and analysed Psg32 exon 1
sequences in mouse strains. MB and FW contributed to
Psg expression studies and YAC fragment assembly. TH
and KO performed FISH analysis for identification of orientation of Psg subclusters. TM co-conceived the project
and coordinated work performed in Cork. WZ co-conceived the project, coordinated all work performed in Germany, and performed bioinformatics relating to Psg
phylogeny and expression.
