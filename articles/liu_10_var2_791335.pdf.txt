A var2 leaf variegation suppressor locus,
SUPPRESSOR OF VARIEGATION3, encodes a
putative chloroplast translation elongation factor
that is important for chloroplast development in
the cold
Xiayan Liu1, Steve R Rodermel2, Fei Yu1*

Abstract
Background: The Arabidopsis var2 mutant displays a unique green and white/yellow leaf variegation phenotype
and lacks VAR2, a chloroplast FtsH metalloprotease. We are characterizing second-site var2 genetic suppressors as
means to better understand VAR2 function and to study the regulation of chloroplast biogenesis.
Results: In this report, we show that the suppression of var2 variegation in suppressor line TAG-11 is due to the
disruption of the SUPPRESSOR OF VARIEGATION3 (SVR3) gene, encoding a putative TypA-like translation elongation
factor. SVR3 is targeted to the chloroplast and svr3 single mutants have uniformly pale green leaves at 22°C.
Consistent with this phenotype, most chloroplast proteins and rRNA species in svr3 have close to normal
accumulation profiles, with the notable exception of the Photosystem II reaction center D1 protein, which is
present at greatly reduced levels. When svr3 is challenged with chilling temperature (8°C), it develops a
pronounced chlorosis that is accompanied by abnormal chloroplast rRNA processing and chloroplast protein
accumulation. Double mutant analysis indicates a possible synergistic interaction between svr3 and svr7, which is
defective in a chloroplast pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein.
Conclusions: Our findings, on one hand, reinforce the strong genetic link between VAR2 and chloroplast
translation, and on the other hand, point to a critical role of SVR3, and possibly some aspects of chloroplast
translation, in the response of plants to chilling stress.

Background
The photosynthetic apparatus of photosynthetic eukaryotic cells is the product of two genetic systems – the
nucleus-cytoplasm and the plastid. Nuclear-encoded
chloroplast proteins usually have an N-terminal targeting sequence and are translated on cytoplasmic 80 S
ribosomes as precursors; import into the organelle is
accompanied by removal of the “transit” peptide to
generate the mature protein (reviewed in [1]). The
chloroplast genome, on the other hand, has many prokaryotic-like features - a remnant of the endosymbiotic

origin of these organelles [2]. Chloroplast DNA-encoded
proteins are translated on prokaryote-like 70 S ribosomes, usually in their mature forms, and assemble with
nuclear-encoded counterparts to form a given multisubunit complex. The coordination and integration of the
expression of nuclear and plastid genes involve both
anterograde (nucleus-to-plastid) and retrograde (plastidto-nucleus) regulatory signals that are elicited in
response to endogenous cues, such as developmental
signals, and exogenous cues, such as light [3-5].
Variegation mutants are ideal models for studying the
mechanisms of chloroplast biogenesis. The Arabidopsis
variegation2 (var2) mutant displays green and white/yellow patches in normally green organs. The green sectors
contain morphologically normal chloroplasts while the

white sectors contain abnormal plastids that lack chlorophyll and contain underdeveloped lamellar structures
[6,7]. The variegation phenotype of var2 is a recessive
trait and is caused by the loss of a nuclear gene product
for an FtsH ATP-dependent metalloprotease that is targeted to chloroplast thylakoid membranes [7,8].
The function of FtsH-like proteases is best understood
in Escherichia coli and yeast mitochondria where they
play a central role in protein quality control and cellular
homeostasis [9,10]. FtsH is thought to play similar roles
in photosynthetic organisms, inasmuch as it is involved
in turnover of damaged or unassembled proteins,
including the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center D1
protein [11-21], the cytochrome b6f Rieske FeS protein
[22], light harvesting complex II [23], and in cyanobacteria, unassembled PSII subunits [24]. FtsH proteins
have also been implicated in membrane fusion and/or
translocation events [25], the N-gene mediated hypersensitive response to pathogen attack [26], heat stress
tolerance [27], and light signal transduction [28].
If VAR2 is required for chloroplast biogenesis, as evident by the formation of white sectors in var2, an intriguing question is how some cells of the mutant are able
to bypass the requirement for VAR2 and form functional chloroplasts, despite having a var2 genetic background. A threshold model has been proposed to
explain the mechanism of variegation in var2 [29]. This
model is based on the observation that leaf cells of var2
are heteroplastidic, i.e. each of the many plastids in an
individual cell acts in autonomous manner [6], and
assumes that there is a fluctuating level of FtsH activity
required for chloroplast function that reflects different
micro-physiological conditions of individual developing
plastids. In wild-type and the green sectors of var2, it is
hypothesized that above-threshold levels of FtsH activity
are present, and that these are sufficient for normal
chloroplast development. Below-threshold activities, on
the other hand, are not sufficient for chloroplast biogenesis and condition the formation of non-pigmented plastids. Our working hypothesis is that the green sectors of
var2 have compensating factors/activities that either
promote FtsH levels/activities or lower the FtsH threshold needed for chloroplast biogenesis. For example, the
VAR2 homolog AtFtsH8 is a compensating factor [29].
To further dissect VAR2 function and to identify the
factors/activities that enable normal chloroplast biogenesis in the absence of VAR2, we and others have carried
out genetic screens for second-site var2 suppressors
[30-32]. To date, a handful of suppressor mutants have
been characterized at the molecular level (reviewed in
[33]). Surprisingly, a majority of these have defects in
the linked processes of chloroplast rRNA processing and
chloroplast translation [31,32,34]. This argues for a linkage between VAR2 and these processes. It is also worth

noting that the various suppressor lines have distinct
accumulation patterns of chloroplast 23 S rRNA, suggesting that rRNA processing defects may not be a secondary effect of perturbed chloroplast function, but
rather that they are a consequence of disruption of specific regulatory steps governing chloroplast rRNA processing [34].
In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of a var2 suppressor line designated TAG-11. We
show that suppression of var2 in this line is caused by
disruption of SVR3, a gene that encodes a chloroplast
homolog of the E. coli TypA translation elongation factor. TypA is a member of the translation elongation factor superfamily of GTPases [35]. We show that
svr3 single mutants and the TAG-11 double mutants
(svr3 var2) have minor chloroplast rRNA processing
defects and a moderate reduction of chloroplast protein
accumulation at 22°C, with the exception of a sharp
reduction in the level of photosystem II D1 protein.
Interestingly, the svr3 single mutant has a chilling sensitive phenotype: at 22°C, it is pale green; while at 8°C it
is chlorotic and has greatly reduced amounts of chlorophyll, aberrant chloroplast rRNA accumulation and processing, and abnormal chloroplast protein accumulation.
Our findings suggest that SVR3 is involved in proper
chloroplast rRNA processing and/or translation at low
temperature. Taken together, the data presented here
strengthen the link between VAR2 function and chloroplast translation. Furthermore, the chilling sensitive phenotype of svr3 provides more evidence that higher plant
chloroplasts are intimately involved in the response of
plants to chilling stress.

Results
Phenotype of a var2 suppressor line, TAG-11

We have previously identified var2 suppressors via ethyl
methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis [30] and T-DNA
activation tagging [32]. In this report, we describe a
T-DNA-tagged var2 suppressor designated TAG-11
(Figure 1A). Analyses of F2 and F3 progeny from a
cross between TAG-11 (generated in var2-5 background) and var2-5 indicated that the suppression phenotype in TAG-11 is due to a recessive mutation that
co-segregates with a complex T-DNA insertion pattern
at a single locus (Additional file 1, Figure S1). We
named this locus SUPPRESSOR OF VARIEGATION3
(SVR3), and the allele in TAG-11 was designated svr3-1.
To isolate svr3-1 single mutants, TAG-11 (var2-5 svr3-1)
was backcrossed to wild-type Arabidopsis and the genotype of the VAR2 locus in the F2 progeny of the backcross was determined using derived cleaved amplified
polymorphic sequence (dCAPs) primers [30,36]. Figure
1A shows that TAG-11 is smaller than wild-type and
has pale green leaves due to significantly less chlorophyll

than normal (Figure 1B). TAG-11 is also slightly variegated at later developmental stages. On the other hand,
most of the phenotypes of svr3-1 are intermediate
between those of TAG-11 and wild-type, including size,
extent of variegation and chlorophyll content (Figure
1A-B). The exception is chlorophyll a/b ratios (Figure
1C), which are lower in svr3-1 than in the other lines.
These observations are in contrast to other reported
var2 suppressor lines, in which the svr single mutants
and the suppressor lines have very similar phenotypes
and the suppressor lines do not display visible variegation [30,32]. This suggests that the genetic interaction
between var2 and svr3 is more complex than the epistatic relationships we have observed before.
Identification of SVR3

The suppression of var2-5 leaf variegation in TAG-11 is
linked with T-DNA insertion events, suggesting that the
suppressor phenotype is likely caused by T-DNA insertions (Additional file 1, Figure S1). But due to the complexity of these events, plasmid rescue attempts were
not successful in cloning SVR3 (Additional file 1, Figure
S1). As an alternative approach, we used positional cloning to delimit the SVR3 locus to a ~123 kb interval on
chromosome 5 using a series of molecular markers we
designed using the Cereon genomics Indel and SNP
databases (Figure 2A; [37]; all unpublished primers used
in this report are listed in Additional file 1, Table S1).
We reasoned that mutations that can cause suppression
of var2 likely affect nuclear genes encoding chloroplast
proteins. Six such genes reside in the ~123 kb interval.
Because the mutation in TAG-11 is probably a complex
T-DNA insertion, PCR using primers flanking wild-type
genomic fragments containing the T-DNA insertion
should fail to amplify wild-type sized fragments. Using
this method we determined that At5g13650 is the gene
bearing the mutation: as illustrated in Figures 2A and
2B, primers F1 and R1-1 failed to amplify a wild-type
sized fragment of this gene from the mutant genomic
DNA. The other five genes, by contrast, gave rise to
wild-type sized fragments using other sets of primers to
amplify TAG-11 genomic DNA. We further found that
primers F1-1 and R1 amplified the same wild-type sized
fragments with either TAG-11 or wild-type genomic
DNA (Figure 2B), suggesting that the T-DNA insertion
in At5g13650 likely resides between primers F1 and
F1-1. Figure 2C shows that transcripts bearing the entire
predicted coding region of At5g13650 are not detectable
in TAG-11 by RT-PCR, suggesting that svr3-1 is a molecular null allele and offering further confirmation that
At5g13650 is the suppressor gene. Although our data
indicate that At5g13650 is disrupted by T-DNA insertion in TAG-11, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that the complex T-DNA insertion pattern in

Page 4 of 18

TAG-11 is a result of several individual insertion events
at closely linked loci.
Identification of svr3-2, a second allele of svr3

To verify that At5g13650 is the suppressor gene in
TAG-11, we searched for a second mutant allele from
publicly available collections of T-DNA insertion
mutants http://signal.salk.edu/cgi-bin/tdnaexpress. One
line (SAIL_170_B11; TAIL number CS871763) was
reported to have a T-DNA insertion in the 10th exon
of the gene [38]. The site of this insertion was verified
by PCR followed by sequencing and the allele was
designated svr3-2 (Figure 3A); homozygous svr3-2
plants resemble svr3-1 plants (Figure 3B). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR shows that the transcript of At5g13650
was not detectable in svr3-2 seedlings (Figure 3C). We
also obtained svr3-2 var2-5 double mutants, and found
that var2 variegation is suppressed in these plants
(Figure 3B). The svr3-2 var2-5 double mutants are also
paler and smaller than svr3-2 single mutant and wildtype plants. The genetic interaction between svr3-2
and var2-5 resembles those between svr3-1 and var2-5,
again suggesting that the interaction between these
alleles is complex. The acquisition of this second allele
of svr3 supports our conclusion that At5g13650 is
SVR3.
SVR3 encodes a putative chloroplast TypA translation
elongation factor

The translation product of SVR3 is predicted to contain
676 amino acids (~74.4 kDa), and it bears high similarity
to the E. coli translation factor TypA (also known as
BipA or YihK) (43% amino acid sequence identity, Additional file 1, Figure S2). TypA belongs to the family of
translation elongation factor GTPases that include EF-G,
EF-Tu and LepA [35]. A comparison of the domain
structures of TypA, LepA, EF-G, and EF-Tu from E. coli
and their putative chloroplast counterparts in Arabidopsis is shown in Figure 4A. It is notable that, with the
exception of a putative chloroplast transit peptide (CTP)
at the N-terminus of the chloroplast-targeted gene products in Arabidopsis (Figure 4A; Additional file 1, Figure
S2), the domains of each factor are highly conserved
between the two species. In addition, the four factors
have many domains in common. A GTP binding
domain (Domain I) is present in all factors, while TypA,
LepA and EF-G share an additional three domains
(Domains II, III and V) [39,40]. EF-G contains a unique
domain IV whereas LepA and TypA each have a unique
C-terminal domain (CTD). The overall domain structure
of TypA is most similar to LepA, which promotes back
translocation of peptidyl-tRNA from P site to A site and
deacylated tRNA from E site to P site, the reverse reaction that is promoted by EF-G [41].

The TypA translation factor is widely but not universally
found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes [35]. A phylogenetic
analysis was performed to investigate the relationship of
TypA homologs in representative photosynthetic organisms (Figure 4B). Only one copy of the TypA gene is
found in E. coli and the photosynthetic cyanobacterium
Synechocystis sp. PCC6803. However, two TypA-like genes
are present in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, rice and Arabidopsis. The products of these genes fall into two distinct
clades. The corresponding Arabidopsis and rice genes in

each clade having extraordinarily conserved exon structures in terms of exon numbers and sizes, suggesting a
common evolutionary ancestor and maybe related functions (Figure 4C). Interestingly, SVR3/At5g13650 is more
closely related to E. coli TypA than to the second Arabidopsis TypA-like protein, At2g31060 (Figure 4B).

to be a chloroplast transit peptide (CTP) of 57 amino
acids [42] and SVR3 has been identified as a chloroplast
protein in several chloroplast proteome studies [43-46].
To confirm the chloroplast location of SVR3, a construct was generated that contained the SVR3 Nterminal region (1-64aa) fused with eGFP under the
control of the CaMV 35 S promoter (designated P35S:
SVR3CTP:GFP), and the construct was transiently
expressed in wild-type Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts. A
control construct contained only eGFP (designated
P35S:GFP). Figure 5 shows that the green fluorescence
signal from the control construct is present in the cytosol (Figure 5A-C), but that the green fluorescence from
P35S:SVR3 CTP:GFP colocalized exclusively with

chlorophyll autofluorescence (Figure 5D-F). These
results indicate that the transit peptide of SVR3 is sufficient to direct a protein into the chloroplast, suggesting
that SVR3 is a chloroplast protein.
Chloroplast rRNA processing defects in TAG-11

Chloroplast rRNA genes (23 S, 16 S, 4.5 S and 5S) are
arranged in single transcription units, rrn operons in the
chloroplast genome (Figure 6A). After transcription, a
series of endonuclease cleavage and exonuclease trimming events are required for the maturation of each
rRNA species [47]. Because chloroplast rRNA processing
defects have been observed in several var2 suppressor
lines [32,34], we wanted to address this question in the

svr3 and TAG-11 plants. For these analyses, total cellular
RNAs were extracted from wild-type, var2-5, svr3-1, and
TAG-11 (var2-5 svr3-1) and Northern blot analyses
were carried out using rRNA gene-specific probes.
Accumulation patterns of the 23 S rRNA, 16 S rRNA
and 4.5 S rRNA species reveal that their processing
is not drastically altered in either TAG-11 or svr3-1
(Figures 6B, C and 6D respectively). However, higher
molecular weight precursor forms of all three accumulate to somewhat higher levels in TAG-11 and svr3-1
compared to wild-type or var2-5. Considered together,
our data suggest that svr3 has a small but measurable
impact on chloroplast rRNA processing.
Accumulation of chloroplast proteins in TAG-11

Though we did not find major defects in chloroplast
rRNA processing in svr3 mutants, we were interested in
determining whether the loss of SVR3 affects the accumulation of chloroplast proteins, given that SVR3 is a
putative chloroplast translation elongation factor. To
this end, we carried out immunoblot analysis on total
leaf proteins from two-week-old seedlings (wild-type,
var2-5, TAG-11, svr3-1 and svr3-2) using antibodies
against representative chloroplast proteins encoded by
both the nuclear and plastid genomes (Figure 7). We
found that the levels of the VAR2 and AtFtsH1 subunits
of thylakoid membrane FtsH complexes are considerably
reduced in amount in var2-5 and TAG-11. This is as

anticipated since reductions in the A pair of AtFtsH
subunits are matched by reductions in the B pair, and
vice versa, likely via post-translational turnover [29].
The coordinate reductions in VAR2 (Type B) and
AtFtsH1 (Type A) [19] further suggest that suppression
of variegation in TAG-11 is not due to enhanced expression/stability of FtsH subunit proteins. Figure 7 shows
that the levels of most other proteins we examined do
not appear to be significantly perturbed in the various
mutant lines, with the exception of the D1 protein of
PSII, which surprisingly was drastically reduced in
amount in TAG-11 and the svr3 single mutants. In
these plants, D1 is present at far less than 25% of the
wild-type amount. This suggests that SVR3 is important
for D1 accumulation.
SVR3 is required for normal chloroplast biogenesis under
chilling stress

Because compromised chloroplast translation often leads
to a chilling sensitive phenotype (e.g., [48,49]), we were
prompted to assess whether chloroplast biogenesis at
low temperature is affected in svr3; i.e. whether TypA
might be involved in the response to chilling stress.
Figure 8A shows the phenotypes of seven-week-old
wild-type, var2-5, TAG-11 and svr3-1 (grown at 22°C for
three weeks and then transferred to 8°C for four weeks).

all mutant lines have a pronounced chlorosis phenotype
due to decreased chlorophyll accumulation (Figure 8B),
suggesting a compromised chloroplast development.
The chilling sensitive phenotype of svr3-1 was further
confirmed in svr3-2 and svr3-1/svr3-2 plants, indicating
that they are allelic (Additional file 1, Figure S3).
To investigate whether the chlorosis phenotype of svr3 is
due to perturbed chloroplast translation under chilling
stress, Northern blot analysis were used to profile the accumulation of several chloroplast rRNA species in samples of
total cellular RNA from yellow leaf tissues that developed at
8°C (Figure 8C-E). RNA samples from emerging wild-type

leaves (green) served as control. Inspection of ethidium bromide-stained RNA gel shows that chloroplast mature rRNA
species are greatly reduced in abundance in svr3-1 and
svr3-2 but not in wild-type when grown at 8°C (Additional
file 1, Figure S5D-F). The accumulation pattern of 23 S
rRNA is shown in Figure 8C. In agreement with the stained
RNA gel, the mature forms of 23 S rRNAs (1.2 kb, 1.0 kb
and 0.5 kb) are greatly reduced in amount in both svr3
alleles while the precursor forms (3.2 kb, 2.9 kb and 2.4 kb)
have an increased abundance. In addition, close examination of the blot revealed that there is a shadowy band (indicated by the asterisk) below the 2.9 kb processing

TAG-11 (var2-5 svr3-1), svr3-1 and svr3-2 grown under the same conditions as in Figure 1A. A dilution series of the wild-type samples were
loaded. Other samples were standardized to equal amounts of fresh tissue. Immunoblots were performed using polyclonal antibodies against
chloroplast proteins of representative complexes: FtsH complex (VAR2, AtFtsH1), PSII (D1, PsbP), PSI (PsaF, PsaN), ATP synthase (ATPa), Rubisco
(large subunit [LS]), Light harvesting complex (Lhcb2) and Cytochrome b6f (Rieske Fe-S). Plastid encoded proteins are D1, ATPa and Rubisco
large subunit (LS). Nuclear encoded proteins are VAR2, AtFtH1, PsbP, PsaF, PsaN, Lhcb2 and Rieske Fe-S.

intermediate in svr3-1 and svr3-2 but not in wild-type, suggesting there might be an additional abnormal processing
site of 23 S rRNA in svr3 mutants. This was confirmed by
Northern blot analyses using 4.5 S rRNA as a probe: in
wild-type, only two bands, the 3.2 kb 23S-4.5 S dicistronic
precursor and the mature form of 4.5 S rRNA, can be
detected, whereas an additional band of ~2.9 kb is present
in svr3-1 and svr3-2 (Figure 8D). This indicates that 23 S
rRNA is abnormally processed closer to its 5’-end in the
mutants and this band likely is the shadowy band we
observed with 23 S rRNA probe. Figure 8E shows the
results of Northern blot analysis using the16 S rRNA probe.
As with 23 S rRNA and 4.5 S rRNA, the precursor form of
16 S rRNA accumulated to a much higher level in svr3
mutants while there was a reduction in the mature form.
Our results suggest that SVR3 is required for normal chloroplast rRNA processing at 8°C.
We next carried out immunoblot analysis to determine the levels of representative nuclear and plastid
encoded proteins in leaf tissues from the mutant and
wild-type plants that developed at 8°C (Figure 9). These

analyses revealed that the levels of most proteins are not
markedly affected by chilling temperatures in the wildtype, the exceptions being D1 and AtFtsH1, which were
reduced about 50% at 8°C versus 22°C. Figure 9 further
reveals that there are dramatic reductions in all proteins
in the mutant lines (var2-5, svr3-1 and TAG-11) compared to wild-type, but in particular in the amounts of
D1, PsaF, LS, and the Rieske Fe-S protein, which are
barely detectable at the chilling temperature. This
indicates that chloroplast-encoded proteins are not preferentially affected by the 8°C treatment. It is possible
that SVR3 affects the accumulation of chloroplast
DNA-encoded proteins at 8°C via disrupting chloroplast
translation, and that the failure to synthesize chloroplast-encoded subunits of photosynthetic complexes
might cause the turnover of unassembled nuclearencoded subunits of the same complexes.
Genetic interaction between svr3 and svr7

Distinct rRNA processing defects have been observed in a
number of different svr mutant lines [34], suggesting that

this process requires various factors. One of these mutants
is svr7. The svr7 mutant, identified in our var2 suppressor
screen, has a pale green phenotype similar to svr3. It is
impaired in a chloroplast PPR protein containing a SMR
domain at its C-terminus [34]. PPR proteins are
RNA-binding proteins that are involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of organelle gene expression [50].
As an initial step to investigate the factors that are
required in chloroplast rRNA processing, we undertook
a genetic approach and generated double mutants
between svr3 and svr7. The genotype of the svr3-1 svr71 double mutant was confirmed by a PCR assay (Addition file 1, Figure S4). The svr3-1 mutant allele contains
a T-DNA insertion, so PCR will fail to amplify the fragment bearing the T-DNA insert from homozygous svr31 plant genomic DNA (Figure 2; Addition file 1, Figure
S4). The svr7-1 allele contains 10 bp deletion in the
SVR7 gene, and the size difference between the wildtype SVR7 allele and the svr7-1 allele can be distinguished by PCR (Addition file 1, Figure S4; [34]). The
phenotype of the svr3-1 svr7-1 double mutants was
examined at 22°C (Figure 10A) and 8°C (Figure 10B).
The double mutant is much smaller and yellower than
either of the single mutants at 22°C. At 8°C, even

though the svr7-1 single mutant is resistant to cold
treatment, the svr3-1 svr7-1 double mutant is susceptible
to it inasmuch that the double mutant shows a chlorosis
phenotype similar to that of the svr3-1 single mutant
(Figure 10B). Double mutant analysis suggests SVR3 and
SVR7 act in different pathways in promoting chloroplast
development.

Discussion
Possible functions of SVR3

In this report, we found that loss of SVR3, a putative
chloroplast TypA translation elongation GTPase, suppresses variegation mediated by var2, and that SVR3 is
essential for plants’ ability to develop functional chloroplasts under chilling stress (8°C), but not at normal temperature (22°C). The TypA translation factor is widely
conserved but not universally present in all prokaryotes
[35], suggesting that it is probably not an essential translation factor. This is consistent with our data that SVR3
is not essential for plant growth and chloroplast biogenesis at normal growth temperature. The subtle phenotype of svr3 at normal temperature and the fact that it
is expressed at this temperature suggest that it probably
plays a minor role in chloroplast translation at 22°C.

At low temperature, however, SVR3 may become more
intimately involved in chloroplast translation and the
lack of SVR3 leads to more pronounced growth defects.
Nevertheless, an alternative hypothesis is that SVR3/
TypA might be a general stress related protein in plants.
The function of TypA has been studied extensively in
prokaryotic systems and it is involved in a diverse array
of processes including response to bactericidal proteins
[51,52], virulence [53,54], capsule formation [55], symbiosis [56] and growth under adverse conditions such as
low pH, and the presence of SDS [56]. In Salmonella
enterica, TypA is able to compete with EF-G in ribosome binding, and the GTPase activity of TypA is stimulated in the presence of ribosomes [40]. It is notable
that TypA is required for several bacteria species to
grown at low temperatures [57-60], which is consistent
with our findings that SVR3 is required for chloroplast
biogenesis at low temperature. However, the exact role
of TypA or SVR3 at low temperature is still not clear.

In plants, TypA-like proteins have been linked to the
development of male reproductive organs [61,62]. The
expression of TypA in Suaeda salsa, a salt resistant
plant species, is responsive to oxidative stresses and
ectopic overexpression of this gene resulted in increased
oxidative tolerance in tobacco plants[63]. However, it is
not clear whether TypA directly regulates these cellular
processes, or alternatively, whether it primarily regulates
ribosome function under various abiotic stresses, and all
other processes are affected secondarily.
Translation elongation factors EF-Tu, EF-G, LepA and
TypA share a similar arrangement of functional
domains, especially the latter three, which share
domains I, II, III and V and each also contains a unique
domain (Figure 4A). Crystal structures of LepA and EFG revealed highly similar three-dimensional structures
[39,64]. Domains I and II are well conserved and provide sites for interaction with the 50 S and 30 S subunits
of the ribosome, while the remaining three domains

Liu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:287
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/287

mediate interactions between LepA, EF-G with the A
site of the ribosome [39,64]. A high resolution TypA
crystal structure is not yet available but based on the
extraordinarily conserved domain arrangement between
TypA and other two translation elongation factors, we
can predict that SVR3/AtcpTypA interacts with chloroplast ribosomes in a manner similar to those of LepA
and EF-G with bacterial ribosomes.
Despite the above discussed similarities between translation elongation factors, it is likely that each factor also
has its own features since each factor contains a unique
domain, which might mediate factor specific interactions
with the ribosome and facilitate different roles in translation. In the case of SVR3/AtcpTypA, the C-terminal
domain may play a crucial role in mediating specific
interactions between TypA and the ribosome at chilling
temperature by mediating specific translation events.
For example, we observed a specific reduction of photosystem II reaction center D1 proteins, but not of other
plastid genome encoded proteins, in svr3 mutants. This
certainly raises the possibility that SVR3 is specifically
required for D1 translation in the chloroplast.
Chlorosis is one common phenotype observed in chilling-injury due to various reasons [48]. Compromised
chloroplast translation is often found in chilling-sensitive
mutants. Early studies with maize mutants such as M-11
[65], v16 [66] and hcf7 [67], showed that these mutants
not only display chlorosis but also have more severe
defects in chloroplast ribosome assembly and/or translation while exposed to low temperature. In tobacco, a
mutant lacking the non-essential plastid coded ribosomal
protein L33 has defects recovering from chilling injury
[49]. Chilling stress in tobacco has also been associated
with the pausing and delay of chloroplast ribosomes during translation elongation of psbA mRNA which in turn
results in reduced synthesis of D1 protein [68,69]. In Arabidopsis, a decreased level of plastid protein accumulation has been described in the chilling sensitive1 (chs1)
mutant [70]. A second Arabidopsis mutant, paleface1
(pfc1), defines a gene encoding a homolog of yeast 18 S
rRNA dimethylase (DIM1). The phenotype of pfc1 is
similar to svr3 inasmuch as it is indistinguishable from
wild-type at normal temperature but displays a chlorosis
phenotype at chilling temperature. The source of this
chilling sensitivity was traced to an adenosine modification in chloroplast 16 S rRNA, which was abolished in
pfc1, providing direct evidence that chloroplast rRNA
processing defects can cause plant chilling-sensitivity
[48]. On the other hand, a perturbed chloroplast rRNA
processing and/or translation does not necessarily lead to
chilling sensitivity [34], suggesting that chilling sensitivity
is induced by defect(s) of a specific aspect(s) of chloroplast translation, rather than to a general compromised
translation.

Page 14 of 18

It is important to note that SVR3, as a translation
elongation factor, is not expected to be a basic protein
component of the chloroplast ribosome per se. Rather
we propose that SVR3 is a regulatory protein that plays
a role in translating specific proteins and that is more
crucial during stress conditions. It is thus interesting to
note that SVR3 protein levels have been found to be elevated in several chloroplast mutant backgrounds, such
as mutants of ClpR2 and ClpR4 protease genes, suggesting that SVR3 may be part of a response pathway that is
activated under stress and some other conditions
[71,72]. Although we do not know how the absence of a
regulatory protein such as SVR3 leads to impaired processing of chloroplast rRNA, our data add another factor to the growing list of proteins that have been
implicated in the processing of chloroplast rRNAs [32].
At this stage, we do not yet know why there is reduced
chloroplast rRNA/ribosome accumulation in svr3 at
chilling temperatures, nor why there is abnormal rRNA
processing and whether these two events are linked.
There are at least three possible scenarios. One is that
SVR3 might bind to ribosomes directly during ribosome
assembly at chilling temperature. This interaction might
protect the 23 S rRNA from being processed by endoand/or exo-nucleases. The abnormally processed 23 S
rRNA would destabilize ribosomes and eventually prevent them from achieving the maximum translation efficiency, which could be critical during the early stages of
chloroplast biogenesis under chilling stress. A second
possibility is that, instead of affecting chloroplast ribosome biogenesis directly, SVR3 might be important for
the robust translation of a factor(s) that is required for
chilling tolerance during the transition from proplastids
to chloroplasts, and that lack of this factor(s) could lead
to the abnormal processing event. Another possible
explanation is that the svr3 mutation slows down chloroplast translation at low temperature, which reduces the
rate of ribosomal protein synthesis, and in turn slows
down ribosome assembly and rRNA processing.
The dramatic rRNA processing defects and loss of
chloroplast proteins at low growth temperatures in svr3
are not common phenomena observed in other svr
mutants. For example, svr7, in which a chloroplast PPR
protein is disrupted, is quite resistant to cold stress and
shows similar chloroplast rRNA and proteins accumulation patterns under normal and cold growth conditions
[34].
Mechanism of var2 suppression in TAG-11

Previously, a number of studies have established a link
between compromised chloroplast translation and suppression of var2 [31,32,34]. The identification of SVR3,
which encodes a putative chloroplast TypA translation
elongation factor, reinforces this notion. However, one

Liu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:287
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/287

distinctive phenotype of TAG-11 is that the genetic
interaction between var2-5 and svr3 is not epistatic as
seen in other suppressor lines [30-32] in that the single
svr3 mutant resembles many other suppressor single
mutants and has a slightly pale green leaf color, but the
double mutant suppressor line TAG-11 is smaller than
svr3 single mutants and displays some variegation at
later development stages. This is true for both alleles of
svr3, indicating that it is specific for the SVR3 locus,
rather than due to independent mutations in the svr3-1
and svr3-2 backgrounds. The incomplete suppression of
variegation in TAG-11 raises the question about the
complexity of the interaction between chloroplast translation and VAR2 function.
Though the exact role of VAR2 in chloroplast translation is unclear, both ours and other’s genetic data have
clearly established a link between VAR2 and chloroplast
translation. The notion that VAR2 may be directly
involved in chloroplast translation is not far-fetched and
in fact is in agreement with findings in mitochondria,
where an FtsH-like protease m-AAA, consisting of two
homologous subunits YTA10 and YTA12, has been
shown to be involved in the degradation of a number of
mitochondrial inner membrane proteins [73]. In a landmark finding by Thomas Langer’s group, the authors
identified proteins that interact with the m-AAA complex [74]. Surprisingly, these include MrpL32, a ribosomal protein of the 50 S subunit of the mitochondrial 70
S ribosome encoded by the nuclear genome. The
authors were able to demonstrate that m-AAA is
responsible for processing of the MrpL32 precursor
after it is translocated into the mitochondria but prior
to its integration into the 70 S ribosome. Furthermore,
many defects of yta10 and yta12 mutants can be rescued by simply providing the mature form of MrpL32 in
the mitochondria, indicating that the failure to properly
process MrpL32 is the underlying cause of yta10 and
yta12 mutant phenotypes [74].
Currently there are no data suggesting similar direct
interaction between VAR2 and its homologues with
chloroplast ribosome. Early findings with chloroplast
ribosomes have established that there are at least two
sub-groups of chloroplast ribosomes: the stromal “free”
ribosomes and the thylakoid-bound ribosomes [75,76].
On the other hand, FtsH complex containing VAR2 is
situated in the thylakoid membrane. Thus it is conceivable that there might be functional relationships between
these two complexes, particularly so considering the
strong genetic link that has been established.

Conclusions
In this report, we demonstrated that the disruption of
SVR3, encoding a putative chloroplast TypA-type translation elongation factor, is the cause for the suppression

Page 15 of 18

of var2-mediated leaf variegation in TAG-11 suppressor
line. svr3 mutations do not lead to major defects under
normal growth temperature (22°C). However, at low
temperature (8°C), the loss of SVR3 leads to major
chloroplast rRNA processing defects and reduced chloroplast protein accumulations. This work identified a
new var2 suppressor locus, reinforced the genetic link
between VAR2 and chloroplast translation and also
revealed a novel role for SVR3 in plant’s responses to
chilling stress.

Methods
Plant growth and maintenance

All Arabidopsis thaliana plants were maintained at 22°C
under continuous illumination with a light intensity of
~100 μmol·m-2s-1. For the chilling treatment, plants were
germinated and grown at 22°C for three weeks and then
transferred to 8°C for another four weeks under the same
illumination conditions. The svr3-1 single mutant was
derived from var2-5 suppressor line TAG-11 while the
svr3-2 single mutant was identified from the SAIL TDNA insertion mutant library under the designation
CS871763 [38]. The svr7-1 single mutant used in this
study is derived from the var2 suppressor line 004-003
[34]. All Arabidopsis mutants used in this study are generated in the Columbia ecotype background.
Chlorophyll Measurements

Two-week-old seedlings were harvested, weighed and
frozen in liquid nitrogen. Plant tissues were ground in
liquid nitrogen and chlorophyll pigments were extracted
using 95% ethanol with gentle shaking at 4°C overnight.
Samples were then centrifuged at 14,000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The supernatants were diluted and used for
light absorbance measurements at 664 nm and 649 nm.
Chlorophyll content and chlorophyll a/b ratios were calculated according to [77].
Map-based cloning of SVR3

Map-based cloning was performed according to [37]. In
brief, suppressor line TAG-11 (var2-5 svr3-1) was
crossed with Landsberg erecta to generate an F2 mapping population. The suppressor gene in TAG-11 was
first mapped to a region adjacent to SSLP marker
nga151 on chromosome 5 by bulked segregant analysis
using pooled DNA from 100 F2 plants [78,79]. Additional molecular markers were designed based on Indel
or SNP polymorphisms between Landsberg erecta and
Columbia ecotypes [37] (Additional file 1, Table S1) to
fine map the gene to a ~123 kb interval using a mapping population of 570 F2 plants (1140 chromosomes).
PCR and RT-PCR primers that were used to confirm
the T-DNA insertion site are listed in Additional file 1,
Table S1.

Plasmid construction and transient expression in
protoplasts

A vector pTF486 (designated P35S:GFP) containing the
open reading frame of eGFP driven by the CaMV 35 S
promoter was used as a control construct [32]. The Nterminal region (1-64aa) of SVR3 encompassing the predicted chloroplast transit peptide was amplified using
primers 13650GFPF and 13650GFPR (Additional file 1,
Table S1) using pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene,
CA, USA). The PCR product was then cloned into the
BamHI and NcoI sites of pTF486. The resulting construct was designated P35S:SVR3 CTP:GFP. Both P35S:
GFP and P35S:SVR3CTP:GFP were introduced into
wild-type Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts and transient GFP
expression was observed [32,80]. The fluorescent signals
of GFP and chlorophyll autofluorescence were monitored by confocal microscopy (Leica TCS NT) using a
FITC-TRITC filter combination.

Generation of svr3 svr7 double mutants

The svr3-1 single mutant was crossed with svr7-1 single
mutant. The genotype of SVR3 and SVR7 loci in F2 progeny
derived from the cross was determined by PCR analysis:
PCR primers 13650F1 and 13650R1-1 was used to genotype
SVR3 locus; PCR primers 004-003F and 004-003R were
used to determine the genotype of the SVR7 locus.

Phylogenetic and gene structure analysis

Full-length protein sequences of SVR3/TypA homologs
were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Genbank. The alignment of the
sequences and the construction of the phylogenetic tree
were performed as described in [32]. Gene structures of
Arabidopsis and rice TypA homologs were constructed
based on the annotation of the Arabidopsis genome
from TAIR http://www.arabidopsis.org and rice genome
from NCBI Genbank.
Protein analysis

Total leaf proteins were isolated as previously described
[29]. In brief, two-week-old seedlings were harvested
and weighed, then ground in liquid nitrogen in 2 ×
SDS-PAGE sample buffer (0.125 M Tris, pH6.8, 4%
SDS, 20% glycerol, 2% b-mercaptoethanol and 0.02%
bromophenol blue) and centrifuged at 14,000 g for ten
minutes. The supernatants were resolved via 12% SDSPAGE, and the proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Immobilon-NC, Millipore, USA).
Polyclonal antibodies described in [32] were used in the
immunoblots. Proteins were detected using the SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescence kit (Pierce, USA).
Manipulation of nucleic acids

The CTAB method was used to extract Arabidopsis leaf
DNA [81], and the Trizol RNA reagent (Invitrogen, CA,
USA) was used to extract total leaf RNA. RNA gel analysis and Northern blots were performed as described in
[32]. RT-PCR was performed according to [29]. Primers
used for generation of probes used in Northern blots,
RT-PCR of ACTIN2, and internal PCR control were
described in [32]. Other primers used in this study are
listed in Additional file 1, Table S1.
