RCDI/eRCDI: a web-server to estimate codon
usage deoptimization
Pere Puigbò1*, Lluís Aragonès2, Santiago Garcia-Vallvé3

Abstract
Background: The Relative Codon Deoptimization Index (RCDI) was developed by Mueller et al. (2006) as measure
of codon deoptimization by comparing how similar is the codon usage of a gene and the codon usage of a
reference genome.
Findings: RCDI/eRCDI is a web application server that calculates the Relative Codon Deoptimization Index and a
new expected value for the RCDI (eRCDI). The RCDI is used to estimate the similarity of the codon frequencies of a
specific gene in comparison to a given reference genome. The eRCDI is determined by generating random
sequences with similar G+C and amino acid composition to the input sequences and may be used as an indicator
of the significance of the RCDI values. RCDI/eRCDI is freely available at http://genomes.urv.cat/CAIcal/RCDI.
Conclusions: This web server will be a useful tool for genome analysis, to understand host-virus phylogenetic
relationships or to infer the potential host range of a virus and its replication strategy, as well as in experimental
virology to ease the step of gene design for heterologous protein expression.

Findings
Some studies suggest that viral genomes may acquire
replicative fitness by selection in one of two ways. First,
a codon usage optimized genome, as observed for
viruses with high replication rates, such as Poliovirus
[1,2]. Alternatively, selection might favour codon usage
deoptimized genomes, as observed for viruses with low
replication rates, such as Papillomaviruses [3,4]. However, some viruses may have both codon optimized and
codon deoptimized genes which may be associated with
a lytic or lysogenic phase respectively [5]. In addition,
some authors propose that suboptimal codons may be
used as a complementary strategy to develop polio vaccines [6-8].
The Relative Codon Deoptimization Index (RCDI) was
developed by Mueller et al. (2006) as a measure of
codon deoptimization, by comparing the similarity in
codon usage of a given gene to reference genome.
Though the RCDI is a useful index for virus research, it
has never been implemented for public use. In this article we describe the web-server RCDI/eRCDI that calculates the RCDI of a set of genes using the codon usage

of a reference genome. However, the codon usage of a
gene may be the product of compositional biases such
as G+C or amino acids composition rather than a
codon usage adaptation [9]. Therefore, an expected
value of the RCDI (eRCDI) is implemented in order to
test the significance of the RCDI values.
Implementation

The RCDI/eRCDI program has been implemented in
PHP as a web-server and it is freely available as one of
the tools of the CAIcal server [10]. The program is also
available for local use as a Perl script to calculate the
RCDI and eRCDI for a great amount of sequences.
Data input/output

The inputs to calculate the RCDI are: 1) a gene (or set
of genes) in FASTA format; 2) the codon usage table of
the reference genome in codon usage database [11] format and 3) the genetic code. Other input parameters
are related to the calculation of the eRCDI and may
be modified according to user requirements. The webserver provides 4 outputs: 1) Genes’ parameters: the
RCDI values, the frequencies for all codons [(CiFa/CiFh)
Ni; see description below] and the %G+C of each gene;
2) Global parameters: the mean %G+C and amino acid

composition, and the number of sequences used to calculate the eRCDI; 3) Statistical tests: the RCDI/eRCDI
server performs a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality of the eRCDI and a Chi-Square Goodness-of-Fit test
to evaluate if the test sequences are homogeneous in %
G+C and amino acids composition and 4) Expected
RCDI: the mean RCDI value from random sequences
and the eRCDI value.
Algorithm
Relative Codon Deoptimization Index (RCDI)

The RCDI/eRCDI server calculates the RCDI by the
equation (1), where CiFa is the relative frequency of
codon i for a specific amino acid in the test sequence;
CiFh is the relative frequency of codon i for a specific
amino acid in the reference sequence; Ni is the number
of occurrences of codon i in the test sequence; and
N, the total number of codons in the test sequence. The
RCDI ranges from 1 (the codon usage of the test
sequence is completely optimized to the codon usage of
the reference genome) to N (increases with the deoptimization of the test sequence). If the reference genome
uses all 61 codons, the maximum RCDI value would be
equal to the inverse of the lowest synonymous codon
frequency value. E.g. for the human genome, the maximum RCDI is 17.64, in the case of a sequence made up
with solely TCG codons, which have the lowest synonymous frequency (0.0567).

Expected Relative Codon Deoptimization Index (eRCDI)

Since the codon usage of genes depends on their G+C
content, it is essential to discern whether codon usage
differences are statistically significant and arise from differences in codon preferences or whether they are
merely artifacts that arise from internal biases in the
G+C composition and/or amino acid composition of the
query sequences. For this purpose, the estimation of
expected values can be useful [9]. An expected value to
test codon adaptation was first described for the Codon
Adaptation Index (CAI) [9]. This expected value is calculated from N random sequences with a similar %G+C
and amino acids composition of the query sequences.
Random sequences are generated either by Poisson or
Markov methods [9]. Using the same principle, an
eRCDI can be calculated from the RCDI of each of
these random sequences. Therefore, the eRCDI value
corresponds to the upper-tolerance limit, based on the
mean and standard deviation, and the level of confidence and coverage introduced by the user. The eRCDI
estimated by our server provides a threshold value to

estimate if a gene is deoptimized and whether this deoptimization is the product of compositional biases (%G+C
and/or amino acid composition).
Interpretation of the results

RCDI values, based on the Mueller et al. (2006) article
[1], may allow for an estimation of the translation rate
of viral genes in particular, and the whole genome in
general. The higher the similarity between viral and host
genes (close to an RCDI value of 1), the higher the
translation rate is [1]. The first and most straightforward
application is to improve expression of proteins in heterologous expression systems, whether increasing the
translation rate or manipulating it to obtain proper folding by choosing a sequence with RCDI close to that of
the viral natural host. Furthermore, from a genetic point
of view, estimation of RCDI may provide insight into
the degree of coevolution between hosts and viruses.
A low RCDI might indicate high adaptation to a host.
Moreover, a high RCDI might also indicate that some
genes are expressed in latency phases or even that the
virus might present a low replication rate.
RCDI/eRCDI complements information from other indices

The information gained from the RCDI may be complementary to that of other common indices like CAI [12]
or the Effective Number of Codons (ENC) [13]. Figure 1
shows results of RCDI, CAI, ENC and G+C percentage
at the third position of the codon (%G+C3) of 2500 viral
sequences (chosen randomly from the NCBI genome
resources http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/genome).
CAI and RCDI were calculated using the mean codon
usage of the human genome as a reference set. As one
may expect, there is a certain correlation (R2 = 0.4023)
between the ENC and the RCDI (Figure 1a). However,
the ENC is a measure of how biased a gene is from an
equal use of synonymous codons and it is independent
of a reference genome, whereas the RCDI is genome
dependent. The indices CAI and RCDI, that are both
genome dependent, have a low correlation (R 2 =
0.0197), reinforcing the idea that these indices may be
complementary (Figure 1b). CAI is a measure of codon
usage adaptation to the most used synonymous codons
of a reference genome [14] and is commonly used to
predict highly expressed genes [15]. On the other hand,
the RCDI is used to assess if the codon usage of a gene
is similar to the codon usage of a reference genome. In
addition figure 1c shows that RCDI values and %G+C3
are linearly independent.
Both indices, CAI and ENC can be associated with an
expected value, the expected CAI by generation of random sequences [9] and an estimated ENC by a formula
that uses the %G+C at the third position of the codon
[13]. In this article we introduce the eRCDI as a

reference genome and to test deoptimization levels in
viral genomes. However, until now, it has never been,
implemented for public use. Therefore, the RCDI/
eRCDI server will be a useful tool for genome analysis.
For experimental virology, it will allow efficient gene
design for heterologous protein expression. At a genetic
level, it may help to establish and understand host-virus
phylogenetic relationships as well as infer the potential
host range of a virus and its replication strategy.
