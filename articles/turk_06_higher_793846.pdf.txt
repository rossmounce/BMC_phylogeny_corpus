Abstract
Background: HIV-1 is characterized by its rapid genetic evolution and high diversity as a
consequence of its error-prone reverse transcriptase and genetic recombination. This latter
mechanism is responsible for the creation of circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) found in nature.
Previous studies from our lab group have shown that the epidemic in Argentina is characterized by
one highly prevalent circulating recombinant form, CRF12_BF, and many related BF recombinant
forms. Since transcriptional transactivation of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter
element requires the essential viral Tat protein, since these genetic structures underwent
recombination in variants widely spread in South America, the aim of this work was to study
transcriptional activity associated with the recombinant LTR and Tat elements.
Results: Differential transcriptional activity was measured for the BF recombinant LTR/Tat
complex that is present in widely spread viral variants was demonstrated. This analysis
demonstrated a higher activity for the BF complex when compared to its B subtype counterpart.
Conclusion: This study indicates structural and functional consequences of recombination events
within the LTR promoter and Tat transactivator protein of a naturally occurring HIV-1
recombinant form.

Background
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a diploid retrovirus whose genome consists of two RNA molecules per virion. This viral RNA serves as the template for
proviral DNA synthesis by the virus-encoded reverse transcriptase (RT) enzyme.
HIV-1 is characterized by its rapid genetic evolution and
high diversity, as demonstrated by the large number of

different HIV-1 strains isolated around the world. This
rapid genetic variation provides the virus with maximum
adaptation efficiency and presents serious challenges for
chemotherapy and vaccine development against HIV-1
infection.
Major mechanisms that contribute to HIV-1 genetic variation include: a high mutation rate as a consequence of its
error-prone reverse transcriptase, and recombination

[1,2]. Genetic recombination plays an important role in
the evolution of HIV-1 [3]. Since two RNA molecules are
packaged into each virion, RT can use portions of each
RNA as template during reverse transcription to generate
a recombinant viral DNA, redistributing the genetic information. Therefore, rapid recombination of the HIV-1
genome creates a vast advantage for viral evolution and an
enormous difficulty for the host to control the infection.

Previous studies from our lab group have shown that the
epidemic in Argentina is characterized by a circulating
recombinant form, CRF12_BF, and many related BF
recombinant forms [7-9]. The analysis also showed that
HIV-1 BF recombinant viruses have diverse mosaic structures that are phylogenetically related in their F and
selected B fragments to the F1 subtype and with BF recombinant viruses from Brazil, respectively [9,10].

Accumulating evidence has confirmed the existence of
recombinant HIV-1 in nature [4]. Some of these recombinant viruses have become fixed in the human population and are referred to as circulating recombinant forms
(CRFs), and in a few cases CRFs have become the predominant strain in specific geographic areas [5,6].

After HIV-1 gains entry to its target cell, the virus integrates
into its host genome. Once integrated, the provirus serves
as a template for transcription of viral genes. Regulation of
early events in viral transcription is mediated by direct
interaction between cellular transcription factors and cisacting elements located in the HIV promoter or LTR (Long

Terminal Repeat) region. At this early phase, the HIV-1
promoter is under control of local chromatin environment, which determines the basal transcriptional activity
(reviewed in [11]). As the viral Tat protein accumulates in
the nucleus, it dramatically increases transcriptional rate
by modifying chromatin conformation at the integration
site, adjusting the activity (initiation and elongation) of
RNA polymerase II and promoting NF-κB activation [1215]. Other mechanisms of Tat-mediated activation of viral
transcription have been described [14,16-18].
As both viral elements mainly involved in HIV-1 transcriptional transactivation (Tat protein and the LTR promoter) underwent intersubtype genomic recombination
in variants widely spread in South America, the following
questions can be addressed: What are the implications of
intersubtype recombination on both the Tat protein and
LTR promoter sequences and their activities? How may
these modifications in transcriptional properties influence viral infectivity? The aim of this work was to reveal
possible transcriptional variation due to the LTR and Tat
recombinant structures. In this study we report not only
structural but also functional consequences of recombination events in the LTR promoter and transactivation protein of the BF recombinant form.

fulfilment of her Ph.D. degree, School of Medicine, University of Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina).

Structural analysis of Tat protein and LTR promoter from
BF samples
Primary structure of tat variants from HIV-1 BF intersubtype
recombinant forms
As it has been reported, BF recombinant forms show different mosaic patterns at the pol region [10]. When analyzing the tat coding region of previously reported full length
sequences corresponding to BF intersubtype recombinant
forms, 4 different structures, named Tat1, Tat2, Tat3 and
Tat4, were found (Figure 1A). Tat1, the most prevalent
variant, was observed in CRF12_BF prototypic strains
(ARMA159, ARMA185, URTR23 and URTR35) and in
other 14 sequences. In these samples, the tat coding
region is predominantly F subtype with a B segment in the
second half of the first exon. Tat2 and Tat3 are each represented by only 2 sequences (ARCH014, AF408632 and
ARMA070, AF408628, respectively). In samples showing
the second Tat variant, each exon clustered with a different
subtype. Tat3 shares the same BF recombinant exon 1
with Tat1, whereas exon 2 is pure B subtype. Tat4 was only
found in ARMA062 and it clustered entirely with the B
subtype, showing no recombination breakpoints.

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/14

As regards the polymorphisms observed in our samples,
we firstly focused on target residues for post-translational
modifications (See Figure 1B for primary sequence
details). Tat undergoes multiple post-translational modifications, such as acetylation, ubiquitination and methylation, which are responsible for the regulation of its
interaction either with RNA and/or cellular factors such as
cyclinT1, p300/CBP and PCAF [19]. Our analysis revealed
that most of these target sites are conserved among BF
viral variants circulating in our country. For instance, K28,
K50 and K51 have been widely described as targets for
PCAF and p300 acetyltransferases and they are crucial for
transcriptional activation. These residues are highly conserved in all the sequences analyzed here, pointing out the
importance of these residues for optimal Tat activity. K71,
a residue whose ubiquitination results in a non-proteolytic mechanism controlling Tat activity [20], is also
highly conserved among all our samples but 3
(ARMA036, AF408628 and AY037280), which showed
substitutions to either arginine (R) or glutamic acid (E).
Finally, Tat is also substrate for arginine methylation at its
basic domain. This domain spans residues 49 to 57, it is
composed of 6 Rs and includes K50 and K51. Residues at
positions 49 and 55 are conserved in all the analyzed samples meanwhile R52, R53, R56 and R57 are conserved in
all but 1, 2, 1 and 5 samples, respectively. It is worth noting that all these substitutions are shown in different samples, i.e. none of the samples have more than one
simultaneous R substitution at the R rich motif. Another
interesting feature is that the most polymorphic residue at
the basic domain is R57 which is the most distant residue
from K50. It may be hypothesized that residues closer to
K50 are important for Tat biological activity while the others are more dispensable.
Another noteworthy polymorphism was found at K29.
Substitutions in this position were present in 19 out of 23
analyzed samples, mostly to R or glutamine (Q). Eleven
out of 19 samples showed a simultaneous change at position 24 (N to K) while the remaining 8 showed an N to R
change.
As regards Tat domains, the N-terminal or acidic domain
is predicted to form an α-helix [21]. In addition to the
negatively charged amino acids placed in this domain, B
subtype Tat has 2 positively charged residues (R7 and
K12) that are likely to stabilize the secondary structure.
Twenty out of 23 BF samples showed asparagine (N) substitutions in one (n = 2) or both (n = 18) residues. As N
has no charge at physiological pH, these substitutions
change the net charge of the whole domain. When analyzing the core and basic domains, no major changes were
observed.

LTR maps for transcription binding sites
LTR maps for transcription binding sites. Organizations of HIV-1 subtype B, F and CRF12_BF recombinant LTRs are
shown. Subtype B has been used as a reference for protein binding sites.

The C-terminal domain (aa 73–101), encoded by the second exon of the gene, shows a considerable variability
among different viral strains and only a few biological
activities have been attributed to it. The first functional
motif identified in this domain was the RGD motif which
is involved in integrin-mediated cell adhesion [22]. Only
7 of the samples examined here-in preserved this motif
intact where most of them showed mutations to RGN. It
was also observed that motif ESKKKVESKA is strikingly
conserved among Argentinean sequences, although the
functional significance of such motif has not been examined in detail yet. This amino acid sequence is present in
the F subtype Tat but is not present in the B clade Tat.
LTR sequences from BF recombinant variants
DNA samples previously characterized as BF intersubtype
recombinant forms at the vpu locus (F02 to F121),
obtained from newly infected individuals between 2003
and 2004, were used as template for LTR amplification
(HXB2 nt -327 to 179). Direct sequencing was performed
on the PCR products, and subtyping was performed by
aligning with reference sequences from different subtypes.
The population-based phylogenetic analysis showed that
11 out of 24 samples clustered together with B subtype
references, and the remaining 13 clustered with F subtype
references, confirming its BF recombinant nature (Figure
2). Distance scanning and bootscanning analysis were
performed for all samples. This analysis further confirmed
the information given by the phylogenetic tree, even for
samples ARCH003, F2, F34, F55, F72 and F108 that

seemed to be less phylogenetically related to their corresponding clusters (data not shown).
To investigate the presence of transcription factor bindings sites (TFBS) in these recombinant LTRs, sequences
were analyzed using the TFSEARCH program (available at
http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html). Major
TFBS were included in this analysis, i.e. USF, TATA box,
RBEIII, SP1, AP1 and NFκB (Figure 3). Sample ARMA 159,
prototype of the CRF12_BF, showed an additional TATAA
box located at position -136. Also sample F121 turned out
to have the additional TATAA sequence. It is remarkable
that both sequences, F121 and ARMA 159, clustered
closely in the phylogenetic tree (see figure 2). This additional TATAA sequence has also been reported for subtype
E LTR and it has been shown as functionally inactive in
this subtype [23]. van Opijnen et al have also shown that
a CATAA box is the actual regulatory sequence at the LTR
promoter, and it was present in all the samples analyzed
here [23].
RBEIII is a cis-acting element known to be binding site for
RBF-2, the Ras response element binding factor 2, recently
described as the USF1/USF2 heterodimer [24]. This site
was found in duplicate in only 1 of the 24 samples studied
(F14). Even though this duplication has been described
previously [25,26] and it is one of the most frequently
occurring polymorphism of the HIV-1 LTR, its clinical
implications are still not clear. Estable et al suggested that
this polymorphism would be selected in vivo because it

but they contribute to the stabilization of the RNA-protein
complex.

Nucleotide changes are highlighted. Changes were found at
positions 31 (U31), 32 (G32) and 33 (G33) in these isolates.

could down-regulate the HIV-1 transcription during
monocyte to macrophage differentiation or T-cell activation [25]. On the other hand, no significant differences
were found in number and structure of USF, SP1, AP1,
and NFκB sequences.
The TAR RNA element is positioned immediately after the
transcription start site (nt +1 to +59) while forming a stable hairpin structure, and having a wide natural variation
that has been described previously [27]. This element was
analyzed and changes in relevant nucleotide positions in
the loop region were found (Figure 4). Nucleotides in this
loop have been shown to be essential in the Tat-CyclinT1/
CDK9 interaction for activating transcription elongation
from HIV-1 LTR. Changes in this region (nucleotides 30–
35) have been related to variations in the interaction with
CyclinT1 while changes at positions 23–24 (bulge region)
have been shown to affect the interaction with Tat [28].
Four of the analyzed samples (F27, F55, F67 and F92) presented changes in the highly conserved 6-nucleotides
sequence (CUGGGA) and changes located at positions
23–24 that form another loop in the TAR stem. Changes
were found at positions 31 (U31), 32 (G32) and 33
(G33). Nucleotide positions 32 and 34 in the loop region
are essential for CycT1-Tat interactions with TAR RNA.
The identity of nucleotides U31 and G33 is not critical,

Functional analysis of of Tat protein and LTR promoter
from BF samples
GFP transactivation in GHOST cells
With the purpose of evaluating both protein expression
and activity of our full length tat-coding constructs,
GHOST cells were transiently transfected with
pTATBF(ARMA159) and pTATB(NL4-3). Forty-eight hours posttransfection tat mRNA was detected by using a qualitative
RT-PCR (Figure 5A). As regards Tat biological activity, it
was invariably found (after four independent assays, each
one in triplicate) that there is no significant difference
between TatB(NL4-3) and TatBF(ARMA159) to transactivate the
expression of an HIV-2 LTR-driven reporter gene (Figure
5B).
Tat capability to restore viral transactivation in HLM1 cells
In order to evaluate if Tat derived from a pure HIV-1 subtype or a prototypic recombinant form share the same
ability to transactivate viral production, HLM1 cells were
either pTATBF(ARMA159) or pTATB(NL4-3) transfected. Viral
production was evaluated at several time points after
transfection in cell culture supernatants. Qualitative RTPCR showed that tat mRNA was readily detected as early
as 6 hs post transfection (Figure 6A). However, viral production was not evident until 12 hs post-transfection (not
shown). Up to 36 hs post-transfection, TatB(NL4-3) – and
TatBF(ARMA159) – driven viral transactivation reached similar levels (Figure 6B). However, at this time point, it was
consistently seen that TatB(NL4-3) tended to show higher
transactivation levels (although non-significant). In
agreement with this observation, 48 hs post-transfection it
was observed that TatB(NL4-3) showed a significantly
improved capacity to drive viral production (p = 0.004).
Transcriptional levels of BF recombinant LTRs
Previous study has shown that LTRs from different subtypes have slightly different transcriptional capacities
[29,30]. By co-transfecting 293T cells with plasmids containing either the LTRB(NL4-3) or LTRBF(ARMA159), and plasmids pTatB(NL4-3) or pTatBF(ARMA159) their transcriptional
activities were tested and compared. FACS analysis, performed 48 hs after transfections, showed an increased
transcriptional level associated to the BF recombinant LTR
when compared to the subtype B LTR (p = 0.02). This difference was evident when pLTRBF(ARMA159) plasmid was cotransfected with pTatBF(ARMA159) (LTRBF(ARMA159) /
TatBF(ARMA159) vs. LTRB(NL4-3)/TatB(NL4-3) and LTRBF(ARMA159)
/TatB(NL4-3) vs. LTRBF(ARMA159) /TatBF(ARMA159)). Slightly but
not significant differences in transcriptional levels were
observed when LTRs were co-transfected with a Tat of different subtype (LTRBF(ARMA159) /TatB(NL4-3) vs. LTRB(NL4-3)/
TatBF(ARMA159)) (Figure 7).

efficiency. Data presented here is representative of 4 independent assays.

ARCH003 and ARCH005 are samples obtained from vertically infected children whose genetic structure suggested
the circulation of the BF recombinant forms since the
mid-1980's [31]. ARCH003 has a B subtype LTR and a BF
recombinant structure in the tat coding region while
ARCH005 has a BF-like LTR and Tat structures. When LTR
transcriptional activity from ARCH003 sample was analyzed it turned out to be higher when it was transactivated
by the B subtype Tat protein than when its own BF Tat protein (pTatARCH003) was used (p = 0.001). ARCH005 LTR
was only evaluated using the B subtype Tat and it did not
show significant differences when compared to the
LTRB(NL4-3)/TatB(NL4-3) complex. Unfortunately, the tat
region from this sample could not be amplified.

LTR diversity among different HIV-1 subtypes may affect
the binding of both cellular and viral transcription factors,
thus influencing the transcription level. This effect, in
turn, may have biological consequence for the different
HIV-1 clades. Although studies on LTR transcriptional
activity of different HIV-1 subtypes have been previously
performed [23,29,30], the consequences of intersubtype
recombination on HIV-1 transcriptional activity has not
been analyzed in much detail. Moreover, most studies
that involved the analysis of LTRs from different subtypes
always used the B subtype Tat protein as transactivator,
which hampers the proper evaluation of the results in
terms of transcriptional advantages, due to sequence
changes in Tat protein activity due to recombination
events. In this in vitro study, a differential transcriptional
activity associated to the BF recombinant LTR/Tat complex found in widely spread viral variants in Argentina was
shown. This analysis demonstrated a higher activity for
the LTRBF(ARMA159) /TatBF(ARMA159) complex when compared to its B subtype counterpart. It also showed that LTR
and Tat proteins from different subtypes (B vs. BF) rendered a lower activity when Tat and LTR did not match in
their subtype, i.e. LTRB(NL4-3)/TatBF(ARMA159) and
LTRBF(ARMA159) /TatB(NL4-3). Phylogenetic analysis of LTR
sequences from the prototypic CRF12_BF sample
(ARMA159) demonstrated that it clustered together with
F reference sequences. The improved transcriptional levels
measured for BF recombinant LTRs are consistent with
previously reported high activity of the F subtype LTR
[29].
Several substitutions were found in the tat gene and in the
LTR sequence from BF samples when compared to their B
subtype counterparts, which may account for the
improved transcriptional potential observed here. When
the Tat sequence was analyzed in detail, it was found that
previously reported elements considered to be crucial for
Tat activity were conserved among BF viral variants thus
stressing the key role of K28, K50, K51 and the basic and
core domains in transactivation. These 2 regions are particularly important for Tat function as they are involved in
cyclin T1 binding, nuclear localization, Tat-mediated proapoptotic-effects and interaction with a wide subset of
transcriptional coactivators and modifying enzymes [1618]. More recently, it was found that Tat is also able to
abrogate RNA silencing by inhibiting the ability of DICER
to process precursor double-stranded RNAs into siRNAs.
Authors demonstrate that K51 is a key residue for Tat suppressor of RNA silencing activity [32].

teins from E and C subtypes are the most active in transactivation [33,34]. Higher transactivation potential of
subtype E Tat was attributed to its longer half-life, which
in turn, was postulated to be dependent on its ubiquitination pattern [33]. Since the E subtype Tat protein contains
more lysine residues acting as ubiquitin acceptor, ubiquitination could occur more readily and contribute to its
extended half-life. Most BF Tat variants (14 out of 23),
including CRF12_BF prototypic strains have a lysine at
position 24 instead of the asparagine residues that characterize B subtype isolates. K24 is a shared feature with the
E subtype Tat and, although speculative, this may partially
account for the higher activity observed for Tat BF.
In order to assess the transactivating capacity of TatB(NL4-3)
vs. TatBF(ARMA159) proteins we used GHOST cells as a
reporter system and also HLM1 cells to observe restoration of viral production. In GHOST cells, we were not able
to observe differences between TatB(NL4-3) and
TatBF(ARMA159). As reporter gene expression in these cells is
driven by the LTR promoter from HIV-2, it is possible that
both proteins, although structurally distinct, share the

same mechanism to modulate transcription in this system. In HLM1 cells, TatB(NL4-3) showed an improved ability to rescue viral production from the Tat-defective
provirus (which harbours a B-matched LTR). This is consistent with the results obtained from the co-transfection
assays where the LTRB(NL4-3)/TatBF(ARMA159) combination
had the lowest transcriptional potential. A naturally
occurring LTRB(NL4-3)/TatBF(ARMA159) combination was
observed in sample named ARCH003. Transmission of
this viral variant can be tracked back to the year 1986. It
was isolated from a vertically infected child with no evidence of reinfection. In vitro co-transfection assays
showed that the LTRARCH003/TatARCH003 complex had significantly lower transactivation potential when compared
to other LTR/Tat combinations but when LTRARCH003 was
co-transfected with Tat B, higher expression of the reporter
gene was obtained. According to the extensive molecular
epidemiology data in our region, we suggest that early BF
recombinant forms had a recombination breakpoint at
the Vpu/Tat region but conserved the LTR of B subtype.
This would render the emerging variants less competent
for transcriptional activation, and natural selection would
have forced the gaining of an F-like LTR. In other words, it
is possible to speculate that F subtype sequences present
in the BF recombinant would be advantageous for the
virus since these changes would increase its fitness, in
terms of transcription. Nevertheless it is not clear yet if
this advantage correlates with what is observed in the field
of the epidemiology.
The LTR analysis showed moderate diversity between the
sequences analyzed. An extra TATA box was found in
CRF12_BF sample and in other patient isolate (F121).
Although this extra sequence is postulated to be inactive
in other HIV subtype, i.e. E subtype, in vitro studies on this
issue are currently in progress. Nucleotide changes were
also found in the TAR region. This region is important for
the Tat/TAR/cellular factor interactions implicated in the
activation of transcription. Base changes at positions 31,
32 and 33 of the loop may affect the interaction with proteins Cyclin T1 and CDK9. Major TFBS appeared to be
conserved between samples with the exception of RBEIII,
which was found in duplicate in one sample. This factor is
important for transcriptional silencing in resting infected
cells and this is the most common polymorphism in clinical isolates. These changes could be, at least in part,
related to the differential transcriptional activities
observed in the BF recombinant variants.

Conclusion
In summary, data presented here shows transcriptional
differences linked to the LTR and tat coding region of BF
recombinants circulating in Argentina. Transcriptional
improvement may be a consequence of the recombination process between 2 different HIV-1 subtypes and selec-

DNA samples and amplification
Extensive HIV-1 genotyping studies have been conducted
by our group. Genomic DNA from HIV-1 infected patients
involved in these studies was used to amplify the LTR
region and tat full coding sequence. Samples previously
characterized as BF intersubtype recombinant forms at the
vpu locus (F02 to F121) were obtained from newly
infected individuals between 2003 and 2004. ARMA159 is
the prototypic strain for CRF12_BF (GenBank accession
N° AF385936; [9]), ARCH003 and ARCH005 (GenBank
accession N° AY037267 and N° AF454487, respectively)
were obtained from children born to HIV-1 infected
mothers. Full length and partial sequences of ARCH003
and ARCH005 samples are available, respectively. Both
samples show recombination between B and F subtypes
although ARCH005 seems to be closely related to
CRF12_BF [31]. HIV-1 molecular clone pNL4-3 was used
as B subtype template. LTR region (HXB2 nt -327 to 179)
and first and second Tat exons were amplified by nested
PCR. All reactions were conducted using the proof-reading Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, USA).
Primers are listed in Table 1. Pasting of tat exons was performed in one further PCR round using primers TECORI
and TXHOI. This allowed us to place both exons together
in frame in one final amplicon.

tion forces favouring the spreading of these recombinant
forms. The fitness of BF primary isolates is currently being
evaluated in our laboratory. Preliminary results indicate a
certain replicative advantage of BF over B isolates, in dual
infection-competition assays (Rubio AE et al, manuscript
in preparation). The correlation between these in vitro
data and the patients' clinical outcome is still not clear
due to the lack of follow-up studies in BF infected
patients. Studies on viral load set-point, disease progression as well as transmissibility of BF variants will be helpful to estimate the impact of emerging recombinant HIV1 genotypes on the spreading epidemic.

Cloning and sequencing
Constructs
named
pLTRB(NL4-3),
pLTRBF(ARMA159),
pLTRARCH003 and pLTRARCH005 were generated by cloning
the LTR amplicons into the pGLOW reporter vector (Invitrogen, USA), upstream of the GFP reporter gene. Full
length tat amplicons were cloned into the commercial
expression vector pTARGET (Promega, USA) generating
pTATB(NL4-3), pTATBF(ARMA159) and pTATARCH003. Colony
screening was performed by colony-PCR and restriction
analysis. Minipreps of positive clones were obtained
(QIAprep Miniprep kit, QIAgen INC, USA) and
sequenced using the Big Dye Terminator sequencing kit
(Amersham, Sweden) on an automatic sequencer
(Applied Biosystems DNA sequencer 3100). Nucleotide
sequences were analyzed and manually adjusted using
Sequencher 4.0.5 software (Gene Codes Co, USA).
Selected constructs were large-scale prepared using the
HighSpeed Midiprep kit (QIAgen INC) and quantified in
agarose gels.
Cells and DNA transfection assays
HLM1, GHOST and 293T cell lines were used in this
study. HML1 cells are HeLaT4+ cells stably transduced
with a tat-defective HIV-1 molecular clone and were
obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH: HLM30
cells from Dr Reza Sadaie [35]. HLM1 cells are negative for
virus particle production but they can be induced to

express high levels of non-infectious HIV-1 and syncytial
cells after transfection or coculture with tat-expressing
clones. GHOST is a human osteosarcoma (HOS) derived
cell line stably transduced with MV7neo-T4 retroviral vector and stably co-transfected with the HIV-2 LTR driving
GFP construct (Kewalramani VN, unpublished data).
293T is a highly transfectable kidney-derived epithelial
cell line.
Cells were grown at 37°C and 5% CO2 in a humidified
incubator. 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Gibco BRL, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco BRL), 2
mM L-glutamine (Gibco BRL), 100 U/ml penicillin
(Gibco BRL) and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Gibco BRL).
GHOST cells were grown in the same medium plus 400
µg/ml geneticin (Gibco BRL). HML1 cells were cultured in
DMEM supplemented with 10 µg/ml gentamicin (Gibco,
BRL) and 10% FBS.
HLM1, GHOST and 293T cells transient transfections
were carried out using Lipofectamine2000 (Invitrogen),
following manufacturer instructions. For single transfections experiments confluent cells grown in 60 mm Petri
dishes were transfected with 8 µg of the corresponding
pTAT construct. For 293T co-transfections, 5 µg of pLTR
and 0.5 µg of pTAT were used. Untransfected cells as well
as cells transfected with empty vectors were always used as
negative controls. Also, empty vectors were used to keep
DNA amount constant in dual transfection experiments.
RT-PCR
Total cellular RNA was extracted from 107 cells using Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL). Three µg of RNA were reverse
transcribed using MMLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen)
and an oligo-dT primer. The mix was supplemented with
RNAse inhibitors (Invitrogen) in a final volume of 20 µl.
Two µl of cDNA were used for tat PCR amplification using
TECOI and TXHOI primers. Amplification of β-actin was
used as RNA quality control. Actin PCR was also performed on 2 µl of the RT reaction using primers β1 and
β2-actin (Table 1).
GFP transactivation in GHOST cells
The use of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene as a
reporter molecule has been widely used to study the transcriptional activity of the HIV LTRs from different isolates.
The fluorescence intensity of GFP is a direct measurement
of the transcriptional activity of the promoter that directs
the expression of the protein. Upon infection or transfection of cultured cells with a Tat coding plasmid, GFP
expression can be measured using a fluorescence activated
cell sorter. One of the main advantages in using this system is that it is possible to simultaneously measure transfection efficiency and fluorescence intensity of the

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/3/1/14

transfected live cells without the need of co-transfection of
a reference plasmid [36,37].
Tat constructs were used for single transfections of
GHOST cells. Expression of the reporter gene was analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS Coulter Epics XL, Becton
Dickinson, USA) in cells harvested 48 hs post-transfection. Living cells were gated by forward angle and sidescatter light. A minimum of 10,000 events were collected
for each histogram. Analytical gates were set such that 1%
or fewer of negative control cells fell within the positive
regions. Data analysis was carried out using System II software (Beckman Coulter INC, USA). Four independent
assays were conducted, each in triplicate. Data was
expressed as the Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MeanI)/%
of GFP positive cells ratio.
Restoration of transactivation in HLM1 cells
Tat constructs were used for single transfections of HLM1
cells. Cell culture supernatants were collected 6, 12, 24, 36
and 48 hs post-transfection in order to evaluate viral production. p24 titers were subsequently determined
through a commercial ELISA assay (Murex, Abbott, USA)
including a calibration curve. Three independent assays
were conducted, each in triplicate.
Subtype-specific LTR transactivation assays
293T were double transfected with different pLTR and
pTat constructs. Expression of the reporter gene driven by
the interaction between Tat and the corresponding LTR
sequence was analyzed by flow cytometry as described
above.
Statistical analysis
All data was expressed as mean ± SD unless, otherwise
stated. Significance (p < 0.05) between means of two
experimental groups was evaluated using the Student's t
test for independent samples (through the Primer of
Biostatistics version 4.02 software).
Phylogenetic and TFBS analysis
A multiple alignment of the newly generated LTR
sequences with selected reference sequences was performed using ClustalX, and visually corrected with the
BioEdit version 5.0.9 http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/
bioedit.html. Subtype ascribing of LTR sequences was performed by constructing phylogenetic trees by Neighborjoining using the Kimura 2-parameter model with the
MEGA v.3.0 program http://megasoftware.net. Bootstrap
analysis was done to assess the stability of the nodes.
Recombinant analysis was performed by bootscanning by
using
the
SimPlot
v.2.5
program
http://
www.welch.jhu.edu and visual inspection of alignments
were used in order to identify breakpoints in recombinant
sequences. After identification of the breakpoints, sub-
