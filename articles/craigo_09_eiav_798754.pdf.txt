Abstract
Background: Equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV), a lentivirus that infects horses, has been
utilized as an animal model for the study of HIV. Furthermore, the disease associated with the
equine lentivirus poses a significant challenge to veterinary medicine around the world. As with all
lentiviruses, EIAV has been shown to have a high propensity for genomic sequence and antigenic
variation, especially in its envelope (Env) proteins. Recent studies have demonstrated Env variation
to be a major determinant of vaccine efficacy, emphasizing the importance of defining natural
variation among field isolates of EIAV. To date, however, published EIAV sequences have been
reported only for cell-adapted strains of virus, predominantly derived from a single primary virus
isolate, EIAVWyoming (EIAVWY).
Results: We present here the first characterization of the Env protein of a natural primary isolate
from Pennsylvania (EIAVPA) since the widely utilized and referenced EIAVWY strain. The data
demonstrated that the level of EIAVPA Env amino acid sequence variation, approximately 40% as
compared to EIAVWY, is much greater than current perceptions or published reports of natural
EIAV variation between field isolates. This variation did not appear to give rise to changes in the
predicted secondary structure of the proteins. While the EIAVPA Env was serologically cross
reactive with the Env proteins of the cell-adapted reference strain, EIAVPV (derivative of EIAVWY),
the two variant Envs were shown to lack any cross neutralization by immune serum from horses
infected with the respective virus strains.
Conclusion: Taking into account the significance of serum neutralization to universal vaccine
efficacy, these findings are crucial considerations towards successful EIAV vaccine development and
the potential inclusion of field isolate Envs in vaccine candidates.

Background
Equine Infectious Anemia Virus (EIAV), a macrophagetropic lentivirus of the family Retroviridae, causes a persistent and potentially fatal infection in equids and a
chronic disseminated disease that is of worldwide importance in veterinary medicine (reviewed in Craigo, et al.
2008 and Leroux et al. 2004). Natural and experimental
infection with EIAV results in a rapid and dynamic disease
process that differs markedly from the slowly progressive
degenerative diseases associated with other lentiviral
infections including HIV-1 infection of humans. EIAV
infection can be transmitted via iatrogenic sources such as
contaminated syringe needles, but is predominantly
spread by blood-feeding insect vectors (mainly horseflies
and deerflies). Hence, disease is most problematic in
regions with warmer climates [1,2]. The actual number of
infected animals in various geographical regions is not
precisely known due to a lack of routine testing. Since its
inception, testing in the United States has generally
increased on an annual basis [3], but the number of animals tested still represents a small proportion of the total
equine population.
EIA disease in equids emerges as a vigorous progression
through three stages: acute, chronic, and inapparent. The
acute and chronic stages of EIA are defined by episodes of
clinical disease that are triggered by waves of viremia and
distinguished by fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia,
edema, diarrhea, lethargy, and various wasting signs. By 812 months post-infection, horses typically progress to lifelong (long-term) inapparent carriers, presumably due to
the development of enduring protective host immunity
[4]. These inapparent carriers, however, remain infected
for life with the maintenance of markedly different levels
of steady state virus replication in monocyte-rich tissue
reservoirs [5-7]. Stress or immune suppression of EIAV
inapparent carriers can induce an increase in viral replication and potentially a recrudescence of disease [7-9].
Thus, EIAV offers a unique model for characterizing natural immunologic control of lentivirus replication and disease, for elucidating the nature and role of viral variation
in persistence and pathogenesis, and ultimately for developing and modeling lentiviral vaccines.
Among virulent lentiviruses, EIAV is unique in that greater
than 90% of infected horses progress from a chronic disease state to an inapparent carrier stage despite aggressive
virus replication and associated rapid antigenic variation.
However, the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) along with state animal regulatory agencies
require euthanasia or strict lifelong quarantine for EIAV
seropositive horses. Within the US, each state drafts its
own requirements with reference to EIAV and the movement of horses as well as changes in ownership of horses.
All seropositive horses must be registered with the state

veterinarians and the federal Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service (APHIS) office [3,10]. Given EIAV's
role as an animal model for HIV vaccine studies, the associated costs of equine testing, and the general issue of
equine health, the development of an effective EIAV vaccine holds a multifaceted significance. Like all lentiviruses, the roadblock to effective vaccine development for
EIAV is the high level of antigenic variation that occurs
during viral replication throughout all stages of infection
and disease.
Studies of EIAV variation during persistent infection in
experimentally infected equids have clearly identified
characteristic changes in envelope sequences that alter
viral antigenic properties, evidently as a result of immune
selection [11-14]. The predominant site of EIAV variation
during persistent infection is the gp90 surface envelope
glycoprotein. The pattern of gp90 nucleotide and amino
acid variation has been analyzed to define distinct conserved and variable protein domains [13,15-17] as
observed with other animal and human lentiviruses
[13,18-21]. Variation of the EIAV envelope gene has therefore served as a distinct marker for analysis of viral population evolution and can hence be utilized as a marker of
variant isolates.
Despite the worldwide prevalence of EIAV infections,
experimental studies to date have centered on relatively
few viral isolates. Analyses of viral pathogenesis have
essentially focused on a strain of EIAV termed Wyoming
(isolated in North America) and its derivatives while a
minority of reported studies have utilized a Chinese variant. In fact, in the last thirty years, 97% of published studies on EIAV natural isolates have been based on the
Wyoming isolate directly, or on in vivo/in vitro derivatives
of this strain (based on a PubMed search on EIAV natural
isolates or experimental derivatives of those isolates
within the last 30 years: approximately 548 publications;
the percentage of the overall number published for each
"strain" was calculated). The variant nature of the antigenicity of EIAV which has thus far obstructed successful
vaccine development mandates that a larger pool of viral
strains be analyzed both for consideration of pathogenesis and determination of immune correlates of protection.
In the current study, we report on the characterization of
the Env genomic sequences of an EIAV field isolate recovered from a long-term inapparent carrier in the state of
Pennsylvania in the United States. The observed variation
of the EIAVPA Env compared to published EIAV isolates
indicates that the current understanding of genomic divergence is greatly underestimated. Further, functional analyses of how the gp90 variation affected antigenic
specificity demonstrated that the observed genomic alterations rendered the isolate neutralization distinct to

immune sera from horses experimentally infected with a
Wyoming-derived virus strain (EIAVPV [22-24]). The
observations of extensive Env variation and neutralization
differences in a primary EIAV isolate indicate the need for
EIAV vaccine strategies that can elicit enduring broadly
reactive host immune responses to protect against diverse
strains of virus.

Clinical and virological profile of plasma transfer recipient #9807
An outbred, mixed-breed naïve horse (#9807) was
infected with EIAVPA by transfer of infectious plasma (5
ml) intravenously. The recipient horse was monitored
daily for clinical signs of EIA (fever, lethargy, petechiation,
diarrhea) and blood samples were taken at regular intervals for measurement of platelets, plasma virus, and EIAVspecific serum antibodies. At approximately 70 DPI the
horse experienced an acute clinical EIA episode characterized by concurrent thrombocytopenia and fever accompanied by a viremic episode of 105 copies RNA/ml (Fig. 1).
Over the course of the observation period (approximately
1.5 years), clinical disease progressed from acute to
chronic to inapparent. Over the 550 day observation

Recovery of a primary EIAV field isolate
To characterize EIAV viral populations of naturally
infected horses, we contacted the local USDA office for
information on regionally identified EIAV positive carriers
that were under quarantine. They identified a 25-year-old
Coggins positive horse that had been infected for 15 years,
but had been clinically inapparent for several years. Analysis of the serum from this donor horse indicated an antibody titer of 104 in ELISA assays against the EIAVPV
reference strain, consistent with the seropositive results
also observed in AGID diagnostic assays (data not
shown). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of plasma from the
donor horse revealed a viral load in the periphery of
approximately 5 × 103 copies of RNA/ml plasma. To characterize the viral population of the field isolate, EIAVPA,
viral RNA was pelleted from the plasma. We designed consensus primers (see additional file 1: Table S1) to reverse
transcribe and PCR amplify the EIAVPA genome based on

currently available sequences in the Genbank repository.
RT-PCR amplification of viral RNA failed to yield products
for cloning and sequencing. It has previously been demonstrated that a blood transfer performed between an
inapparent carrier and an EIAV naïve equine results in
febrile EIA disease [7]. We also previously demonstrated
that a majority of the viral quasispecies found in the first
febrile episode reflect the same genomic sequence as the
infectious inoculum [11-13]. Taken together, we chose to
characterize the EIAVPA population of the inapparent carrier via a plasma transfer between the naturally infected
animal and an EIAV naïve recipient horse.

Clinical and virological profiles of experimentally infected horse #9807. Horse #9807 was experimentally infected
with EIAVPA by intravenous inoculation with 5 ml of plasma from the reference Pennsylvania field isolate inapparent carrier.
Rectal temperatures (red line, right Y axis) and platelet counts (blue dashed line, 1st left Y axis) were followed daily for approximately 550 days (X-axis). Quantitation of the virus load (green diamond, 2nd left Y axis) was performed on viral RNA
extracted from plasma at periodic time points during throughout the initial infection, fever episodes and asymptomatic stages.
Febrile episodes were defined by a rectal temperature above 39°C in conjunction with a reduction in the number of platelets
below 100,000/μl of whole blood and other clinical signs of EIA disease. The acute phase of disease (74DPI) from which viral
populations were sampled is indicated (pink arrow).

period there was a total of five fever episodes. The viral
loads exhibited typical fluctuations averaging around 103
copies RNA/ml plasma in periods of steady state replication and increasing to about 105 -106 copies RNA/ml
plasma during febrile episodes (Fig. 1).
Isolation, cloning, and sequencing of EIAVPA clones
To characterize the viral quasispecies of EIAVPA, we isolated viral RNA from plasma taken during the acute episode, or 74 days post infection (DPI), in the recipient
horse. The majority of EIAV genomic variation occurs in
the 3' half of the viral RNA that encodes the envelope, rev,
and the long terminal repeat (LTR) [2,4,7]. Thus, utilizing
the consensus primers described in 3.1, we RT-PCR amplified the entire 3' half (~3 Kb) of the genome. The purified
fragments were cloned, and a total of 18 positive clones
subjected to sequence analysis.
Population analyses of EIAVPA quasispecies
Our primary goal was to explore natural EIAV diversity
that directly affects vaccine development by examining
the env gene, specifically the gp90 region. Three other
prime regions of relevance, but not of primary significance for vaccine development, namely the env gp45, S2,
and rev genes, as well as the LTR were also sequenced; and
the results are included in the additional files 2, 3, 4 and
5. Once nucleotide sequencing was completed, the
deduced amino acid sequences were visually inspected to
determine the phenotype of the viral quasispecies (Fig. 2
and additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, Figs. S1-S4). Immediately,
the primary observation is the vast difference in the EIAVPA sequences as compared to the widely utilized Wyoming-derivative EIAVPV and the published Chinese
vaccine strain (Fig. 3). The EIAVPA Env sequences varied
well outside of the currently designated gp90 "variable"
regions [13,15,17]. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated
that the observed sequence differences between the EIAVPA isolates and other known EIAV strains cluster the
reported Env populations and the EIAVPA population into
a star phylogeny reminiscent of the clades distinguished
in HIV-1 subtypes (Fig. 3). Calculated diversity between a
consensus EIAVPA amino acid sequence and Wyoming
gp90 was approximately 40%, compared to the current
13% maximum reported divergence among published
EIAV gp90 sequences from Wyoming- derived and Chinese strains. Variations within the gp90 amino acid residues included the shifting of potential N-linked
glycosylation sites among the EIAVPA quasispecies as compared to the Wyoming-derivative gp90 sequences. Lentiviruses utilize dense glycosylation to shield the envelope
proteins from immune recognition. The number of potential glycosylation sites observed in the EIAVPA gp90 ranged
from 15-21, depending on the individual Env clone. On
average there were 19 potential glycosylation sites in the

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/95

EIAVPA gp90, approximately 10% higher than what is
observed with the Wyoming-derivative EIAV species.
Notable, however, is the relative conservation of the
approximate location of these glycosylation sites among
the variant gp90 quasispecies. For example, in the "V3"
region the EIAVPA population maintained three potential
N-inked glycosylation sites in all variants, however, the
exact location of the sites "shifted" within the respective
V3 domains of the variant Env species. As observed previously, there appears to be a complete preservation of all
cysteine locations in the EIAVPA gp90 compared to published Env sequences despite the marked variation among
these gp90 species. This conservation of cysteine residues
appears to be indicative of secondary structural conservation, presumably related to their role in disulfide bridges
and loop formations within the gp90 protein. Furthermore, comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences
determined for the gp45, Rev, and S2 proteins also reveals
a conservation of critical structural features despite the
substantial variation in protein sequences and high levels
of average divergence (gp45, 44%, Rev, 39%, S2, 54%)
from the Wyoming strain (additional files 3, 4, 5, Figs. S2S4). For example, in gp45 all extracellular potential Nlinked glycosylation sites are maintained between species
although the amino acid make-up of the site may vary.
Similarly, in spite of the significant differences in the
amino acid sequence of EIAVPA Rev compared to published Rev sequences, the published RNA binding domain
and nuclear export signals of Rev are conserved in EIAVPA.
Characterization of EIAVPA envelope antigenic properties
To characterize the effects of the observed EIAVPA gp90
variation on antigenic properties of the Env protein, we
next evaluated the Env-specific serum antibody responses
of horse #9807 utilizing two separate methods, end point
titer analyses (heterologous) and neutralization (homologous and heterologous) assays. We have previously characterized a complex and lengthy maturation of immune
responses to viral envelope proteins during the first six to
eight months post-infection that appears to be a distinctive feature of lentiviral infections as steady state infection
and host immunity levels are established [25-28]. The
serum of the inapparent carrier cross-reacted in ELISA
with the Env proteins of our reference strain EIAVPV as
demonstrated in earlier analyses (c.f. section 3.1). Hence,
we initially characterized the development of serum antibodies in horse #9807 by longitudinal analyses of serum
end-point titers to the Env protein of the reference strain
EIAVPV. The evolution of the end-point titer of EIAV-specific serum antibodies demonstrated a characteristic
development of a mature response that gradually
increased throughout the first 6 months of infection, at
which time the end point titer reach a steady state of
approximately 104 (Fig. 4A).

We have reported a moderately slow development of
serum neutralizing antibodies over a several month
period following experimental EIAV infection of horses,
with average maximum neutralization titers averaging
1:300 [5,27]. To examine the ability of the EIAVPA strain to
elicit homologous and heterologous serum neutralizing
antibodies, we assayed the ability of serum samples taken
from horse #9807 (428 DPI) and the original Pennsylvanian inapparent carrier (two months post transfer to
#9807) to neutralize EIAVPA and EIAVPV gp90 species, as
presented on otherwise common proviral constructs (Fig.
4B). The neutralization activity of a reference immune
serum taken from a horse experimentally infected with

EIAVPV (1,574 DPI) was assayed in parallel as a control.
Interestingly, immune sera from the experimentally EIAVPA and the EIAVPV infected horses were able to neutralize
only virus containing the homologous virus gp90; there
was no detectable neutralization of the virus containing
the heterologous gp90 species. In contrast, however, the
immune serum from the naturally infected inapparent
carrier displayed neutralization activity against both the
EIAVPA (1:200 titer) and EIAVPV (1:55 titer) gp90 Env species. Two-way ANOVA analyses of the neutralization
results indicate a significant difference between the ability
of the inapparent carrier serum to neutralize the two different gp90 Env proteins (P < 0.0001).

Discussion
EIAV in addition to being an animal model for HIV/AIDS
studies is a potentially fatal and economically significant
infectious disease of equines found in populations of
horses worldwide. We have thoroughly explored the evolution of Wyoming-derivative EIAV strains [11-14,29-35]
and investigated in detail EIAV interactions with the
immune system [5,28,36] as well as mechanisms of protection towards the development of a vaccine [28,36-43].
Vaccine development is essential to the global control of
EIA. A common problem to all lentiviral vaccine development is the obstacle of viral evolution and more specifically viral Envelope variation and diversity.
To address this problem of Env variation and vaccine efficacy, it is essential to develop a more detailed characterization of the natural level of variation in the primary
protein conferring vaccine protection, gp90. The overall
level of envelope divergence observed for other common

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/6/1/95

lentiviruses such as the small ruminant lentiviruses
(SRLV), FIV, SIV and HIV have averaged between 10-35%
[44-51]. Present understanding of the variation of EIAV
has been based on a very limited number of natural field
isolates. The current study of the EIAVPA isolate represents
the first characterization of the Env protein of a natural
primary isolate. The data reveal a much greater extent of
Env variation than previously deduced from published
Env sequences from a limited number of reference viral
strains, all cell-adapted. The observed variation of the EIAVPA inapparent carrier population was very similar to what
we have recognized in inapparent carriers from experimental infections. The level of diversity was at the same
average level (data not shown) and the included phenotypic changes of a similar nature to previously observed
evolution in experimental infections. While the largest
amount of variation previously reported among published Env sequences indicated a maximum divergence of
up to 13% variation [11,12], the EIAVPA gp90 sequence
reveals a divergence of about 40% from EIAVPV and other
published Env sequences. In addition to the presumed
effects of this extent of Env variation on vaccine development, it is important to note that the EIAVPA gp90
sequence is derived from a primary virus isolate that has
never been passaged in cell culture. Thus it may be
assumed that the EIAVPA Env species may in fact be more
representative of natural Env populations than the currently published Env species that are derived from virus
isolated by cell culture. In this regard, the EIAVPA may be
considered a better candidate for vaccine development
compared to other cell adapted strains of EIAV.
Recently we published a report detailing the specific
affects of envelope sequence variation on vaccine protection [42]. In that study we identified for the first time a significant, inverse, linear correlation between vaccine
efficacy and increasing divergence of the challenge virus
gp90 compared to the vaccine virus gp90 protein. The vaccine study demonstrated approximately 100% protection
of immunized horses from disease after challenge by virus
with a homologous gp90, but only 50% protection
against challenge by virus with an Env that was 13% divergent from the vaccine strain. The calculated linear relationship predicted a complete lack of protection of
immunized horses from disease upon challenge with a
virus gp90 that is 23% divergent from the vaccine strain.
Thus, these data suggest that the 40% divergence observed
with the EIAVPA strain would present a substantial obstacle to the development of a broadly protective vaccine
against EIA.
The extensive divergence observed between the EIAVPA
and EIAVPV Env would predict differences in immunogenicity and antigenicity, including neutralization sensitivity. The current data indeed indicated distinct

neutralization specificities for the two variant Env species.
However, the current immune assays also indicated a substantial amount of cross reactive serum antibody as measured by ELISA assays, indicating common antibody
epitopes in the variant Env proteins, despite the 40%
divergence in gp90 amino acid sequences (Fig. 4A). Why
this antibody cross-reactivity did not confer neutralization
of variant infectious viruses remains to be determined by
more rigorous characterization of the neutralization
epitopes of the Env protein and the effects of sequence
variation on antibody binding to and inactivation of virions.

positive horse. The horse had been EIAV seropositive for
approximately 15 years at the time of sampling, as determined by repeated serum testing in the present USDA reference AGID diagnostic assay [52]. Per Pennsylvania
statutes and regulations, the horse was maintained in isolation and was under the surveillance of the local USDA
Office with annual EIAV retesting. Under the supervision
of the local USDA veterinarian, 500 ml of whole blood
was drawn from this inapparent carrier by venipuncture
into an ACD vacuum bottle. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), plasma, and sera were collected and
stored as previously described [13].

It is of interest to note that only the immune serum from
the long-term inapparent carrier displayed significant
neutralization activity against both the EIAVPA and EIAVPV
Env species (Fig. 4B). Since this immune serum reflects at
least 25 years of persistent EIAV infection, it is possible
that the broad neutralization activity is due to a maturation of antibody responses to constantly changing EIAV
populations with variant Env quasispecies over this time
period. While the mechanism of this cross neutralization
is uncertain, it may be attributed to the collection of antibody responses to immuno-dominant type specific variable domains of the viral gp90 protein or alternatively to
the slowly progressive development of antibody to
immuno-recessive conserved domains of gp90. Experimental differentiation between these alternative mechanisms will provide important fundamental information
relevant to the design of optimal Env protein for vaccine
development.

Attaining an EIAV field isolate
Initial attempts to amplify and clone EIAV from the
plasma of the inapparent carrier yielded insufficient levels
of viral genomic PCR products (data not shown), probably due to a very low level of viremia at the time of isolation [12]. We have previously demonstrated that the viral
population associated with the initial febrile episode in an
experimentally infected horse fundamentally represents
the species present in the infectious inoculum [11-13] and
provides a much higher viral level to obtain samples for
analysis. Thus, we transferred plasma from the inapparent
carrier to a naïve recipient horse to amplify the viral quasispecies for subsequent isolation and characterization.

Conclusion
The ability of the immune serum from the long-term inapparent carrier to ultimately neutralize viruses expressing
either the EIAVPV and EIAVPA gp90 protein species indicates that it is possible for the horse immune system to
develop broadly neutralizing serum antibodies. Based on
this observation, it will now be possible to experimentally
identify the specific Env sequences that are reactive with
cross-neutralizing antibodies and that may be used in vaccines to develop enduring broadly reactive antibody
responses. Whether we can incorporate this new EIAVPA
sequence information into an immunogen that can confer
the level of protection observed in long-term infected animals such as the Pennsylvania animal is the challenge to
vaccine development and remains to be seen. What is definite is that additional field isolates need to be evaluated
in order to develop EIAV vaccines that have a chance of
being broadly protective to EIAV infection.

Methods
Identification of a natural EIAV inapparent carrier
The USDA local office (Allegheny County, Pennsylvania)
identified a naturally infected, clinically inapparent, EIAV-

Experimental infection of naïve horses
An outbred, mixed-breed naïve horse (#9807) was
infected with the Pennsylvanian EIAV (EIAVPA) field isolate by transferring 5 ml of infectious plasma from the
identified naturally infected donor animal. The animal
was monitored daily and maintained as described previously [13,14]. Platelet numbers were determined using
the Unopette microcollection system (Becton Dickinson,
Rutherford, N.J.). Clinical EIA (fever) episodes were determined on the basis of rectal temperature and platelet
count in combination (rectal temperature > 39°C; platelet
number < 100,000/μl of whole blood) with the presence
of infectious plasma virus [2,7,13,14]. Samples of whole
blood, serum, and plasma were collected weekly and daily
during fever episodes. Plasma samples were stored at 80°C until used to determine plasma viral RNA level and
to perform genetic analysis of viral RNA. Serum samples
were stored at -20°C until being tested for antibody reactivity.
Field isolate viral RNA purification and amplification
Viral RNA was extracted as described previously
[12,13,41]from plasma taken during the acute disease episode in the recipient horse at 74 DPI. Reverse transcription of 2 to 5 μl of purified viral RNA was performed with
the SuperScriptII PreAmplification System (GibcoBRL,
Rockville, MD) as previously described [13]. Multiple
nested amplifications of the 3' half of the genome were

Retrovirology 2009, 6:95

performed as reported [13] using the Elongase mix (Gibco
BRL, Rockville, MD). Primers for primary and nested
amplifications are detailed in additional file 1, Table S1.
PCR products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel prior to
purification and cloning.
Quantitative Viral RNA determinations
Plasma samples were analyzed for the levels of viral RNA
per milliliter of plasma using a previously described quantitative real-time multiplex RT-PCR assay based on gagspecific amplification primers [53]. The standard RNA
curve was linear in the range of 101 molecules as a lower
limit and 108 molecules as an upper limit.
Cloning and Sequencing
Several independent RT-PCR products (3 independent RT
reactions and 8 independent nested PCR reactions) were
generated (refer to 2.2.2), gel-purified using Qiagen's
Qiaex (Valencia, CA), and cloned individually into the
pCR2.1-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Individual clones were screened by PCR. Positive colonies
were consequently grown, plasmid DNA was extracted,
and clones automatically sequenced (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) using internal EIAV primers (see additional file 1, Table S1). DNA sequences were resolved with
an ABI Prism 373 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA).
Sequence Analysis
Sequences were assembled and error checked using GeneJockey II (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK). Nucleotide and
deduced amino acid sequences from each clone were
aligned using the ClustalW multiple sequence alignment
program from the GCG Wisconsin software package and
edited manually when necessary. Alignments were performed for each genomic region with the reference strains:
Wyoming, Wyoming derivative strains EIAVPV and
EIAVWSU5, and the Chinese vaccine strain. The amino acid
divergence calculations were determined using the
Kimura distance correction.

Distance analyses were conducted using Distance software
as implemented in the GCG Wisconsin software package
[54]. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences were constructed
by the neighbor-joining method with the optimality criterion set to distance as measured in PAUP [55]. Statistical
significance of branchings and clustering were assessed by
bootstrap re-sampling of 1000 pseudoreplicates on the
complete data set represented in a 75% majority-rule consensus tree. The tree was edited for presentation using
Treeview68 K version 1.5.
Nucleotide Sequences
All sequences have been submitted to GenBank. Nucleotide accession numbers are GBQ855742-GBQ855758.

Construction and production of EIAVPAgp90
To compare the neutralization properties of the EIAVPA
envelope to those of the EIAVPV, we generated a chimeric
clone in which the gp90 of the representative predominant EIAVPA clone (associated with the first disease cycle)
was substituted into the proviral backbone of our reference EIAVUK3 molecular clone [56] utilizing standard
molecular biology techniques [57]. Briefly, the gp90 gene
of clone 2 from the PA field isolates derived from horse
#9807 was digested with PasI and BtsI. The purified digestion product was ligated into the EIAVUK3 backbone,
which had also been digested with BtsI and Pas I (partial
digestion with PasI). Clones were screened by sequencing
using internal EIAV primers. Chimeric virus (EIAVPAgp90)
was produced by transfecting a 4-μg sample of purified
DNA from the chimeric proviral clone into 105 fetal
equine kidney (FEK) cells as specified by the manufacturer
of the GenePorter Transfection kit (GTS, San Diego,
Calif.). The number of infectious units per ml of supernatants from transfected FEK cell cultures was then determined in a standardized infectious-center assay that uses
a cell-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection system to study FEK cells [58].
Serological Analyses
Detection of serum antibody reactivity to the EIAV capsid
protein p26 was conducted using the ViraCHEK®/EIA kit
per the manufacturer's instructions (Synbiotics Laboratory, Via Frontera, San Diego, CA). Serum samples were
also evaluated for seroreactivity by the standard Coggins
AGID diagnostic assay for EIA. Serum IgG antibody reactivity to EIAV envelope glycoproteins was assayed quantitatively (end point titer) using our standard concanavalin
A (ConA) ELISA procedures [27]. Virus neutralizing activity to EIAVPV [22-24] and EIAVPAgp90 (refer to 2.6) mediated by immune sera was assessed in an indirect cellELISA based infectious center assay using a constant
amount of infectious virus and sequential 2-fold dilutions
of serum [27,58]. Statistical significance was calculated
using GraphPad software (GraphPad software Inc.,
LaJolla, CA.).
