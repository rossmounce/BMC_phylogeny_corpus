Abstract
Background: In Mexico, primary pulmonary histoplasmosis is the most relevant clinical form of the disease. The
geographical distribution of specific strains of Histoplasma capsulatum circulating in Mexico has not been fully
established. Outbreaks must be reported in order to have current, updated information on this disease, identifying
new endemic areas, manner of exposure to the fungi, and molecular characterization of the causative agents. We
report a recent outbreak of histoplasmosis in treasure hunters and the molecular characterization of two isolates
obtained from these patients.
Methods: Six patients admitted to the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER) in Mexico City
presented severe respiratory symptoms suggestive of histoplasmosis. They acquired the infection in the
Veracruz (VZ) endemic zone. Diagnosis was made by X-ray and Computed tomography (CT), liver function,
immunological techniques, and culture. Identification of H. capsulatum isolates was confirmed by using
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted with a probe from the M antigen, and the isolates were
characterized by means of Random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR employed the 1253
oligonucleotide and a mixture of oligonucleotides 1281 and 1283. These were compared to eight reference
strain isolates from neighboring areas.
Results: X-ray and CT revealed disseminated micronodular images throughout lung parenchyma, as well as
bilateral retrocaval, prevascular, subcarinal, and hilar adenopathies, hepatosplenomegaly, and altered liver function
tests. Five of the six patients developed disseminated histoplasmosis. Two H. capsulatum strains were isolated. The
same band profile was detected in both strains, indicating that both isolates corresponded to the sole
H. capsulatum strain. Molecular characterization of the isolates was similar in 100% with the EH-53 Hidalgo
human (HG) strain (reference strain integrated into the LAm A clade described for Latin America).
Conclusions: The two isolates appeared to possess the same polymorphic pattern; they are indistinguishable from
each other and from EH-53. It is important to remain updated on recent outbreaks of histoplasmosis, the manner
of exposure to the fungi, as well as the molecular characterization of the isolates. The severity of cases indicates
that this strain is highly virulent and that it is probably prevalent in Hidalgo and Veracruz states.

Background
Histoplasma capsulatum develops in bird excrement or
bat guano in closed areas (caves, mines, tunnels) or in
open spaces (parks, orchards, and abandoned homes,
among others). The organic material found in these
waste materials under humid conditions and optimal
temperatures establishes the ecological niche for the
mycelial phase of development, and microconidium constitutes the infectious form of the fungus [1-3]. There
have been three distinct genotypes and varieties of
H. capsulatum, and two have infected human beings:
H. capsulatum var. capsulatum, and H. capsulatum var.
duboisii; in addition, one has infected equines (H. capsulatum var. farciminosum). These exhibited different clinical manifestations and geographical distributions [4-6].
However, a phylogenetic study by Kasuga and colleagues
[7,8] was conducted in an attempt to resolve the relationships among the major classes and three varieties of
H. capsulatum. At least eight clades were identified: (i)
North American class 1 clade; (ii) North American class
2 clade; (iii) Latin American group A clade; (iv) Latin
American group B clade; (v) Australian clade; (vi) Netherlands (Indonesian?) clade; (vii) Eurasian clade, and
(viii) African clade. Seven of the eight clades represented
genetically isolated groups that may be recognized as
phylogenetic species.
This fungus is the etiological agent of systemic mycosis histoplasmosis. The mycosis is an endemic disease of
tropical, subtropical, and temperate areas throughout
the world. Histoplasmosis has been described as present
in all of the 32 states of the Mexican Republic, with
highly variable prevalence [3,9-19]. Veracruz is one of
the federal entities with the greatest number of cases
reported [18]. In Mexico, histoplasmosis is considered
an occupational disease that especially affects miners,
farmers, guano collectors, cockfight breeders, geologists,
speleologists, anthropologists, and biologists. Primary
pulmonary histoplasmosis (PPH) is the most relevant
clinical form of the disease with the highest mortality
rate worldwide [10,11,18,20]. The clinical manifestations
of this mycosis may range widely, from being clinically
benign to severe, even fatal, depending upon the amount
of propagules inhaled, the immunological state of the
infected host, and the strain’s virulence [3]. It is important to report outbreaks of histoplasmosis in order to
know the current status of this disease, identify new
endemic areas, and for molecular characterization of the
causative agents. This study reports on an outbreak of
histoplasmosis in treasure hunters in the endemic zone
of Veracruz and the molecular characterization of two
isolates from these patients.

Methods
Case studies

Six patients (two children and four adults), one with
type 2 diabetes mellitus, were admitted to the Instituto
Nacional de Enfermedades Respiratorias (INER) in Mexico City in August 2007 with severe histoplasmosis-associated respiratory symptoms. On questioning, patients
referred having family ties among themselves and that
they were residents of Naucalpan, near Mexico City.
They had traveled to the town of Tamarindos, Ciudad
Cardel, Veracruz (a histoplasmosis endemic zone)
(Figure 1) in a search for treasure. They had slept for 3
consecutive days in a house and also mentioned that
they excavated for 2 days with constant exposure to
dust, migratory bird excreta, as well as bat guano in
surrounding areas.
Informed consent was obtained from patients or their
parents or guardians, and the Human Experimentation
Guidelines of the Institution were followed according to
clinical research conduct.
Isolation and identification of H. capsulatum and
detection of anti-H. capsulatum antibodies

The specimens analyzed included bronchial washings,
sputum, and blood. All samples were sent to the laboratory for immediate processing. Direct examination from
specimens with 15% potassium hydroxide was performed, as well as cytological tests with methenamine
silver (Grocott) and Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining,
in Sabouraud dextrose-agar (SDA) cultures, and SDA
with antibiotics (chloramphenicol, 50 mg/L, and

cycloheximide, 500 mg/L). Isolates were identified on
the basis of colonial and microscopic morphology. Serological tests for anti-H. capsulatum antibodies included
Capillary tube precipitation (CTP) [21], gel Immunodiffusion (ID) [22-24], and the indirect Enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method according to
Voller et al. [25]. Immune cell response was assessed by
means of skin testing; this method evaluates the reactivity of the patients to histoplasmin. Changes observed in
lungs, liver, and spleen were assessed utilizing X-rays
and CT scans.
Molecular identification and characterization of isolates

Molecular typing of the two isolates was performed
employing Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). H. capsulatum reference strains were used from Mexican patients
with disseminated histoplasmosis: EH-53 from Hidalgo
(HG) and EH-317 human from Morelos (MS), and the
following isolates from infected bats: EH-397 Pterotus
davyi, and EH-398 Leptonycteris curasoae from Oaxaca
(OC); EH-406 Leptonycteris novalis and EH-408 Leptonycteris novalis from Puebla (PL), and EH-437 Desmodus rotundus and EH-449 Leptonycteris novalis from
Morelos (MS), all of these areas located near the state
of Veracruz. All of these strains are labeled as follows:
“Histoplasma capsulatum Strain Collection of the Fungal Immunology Laboratory of the Department of
Microbiology-Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, National
Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM)”, which is
registered in the World Data Centre for Microorganisms
(WDCM) database under the acronym LIH-UNAM
WDCM817. Information on strains is available at the
website [26].
DNA extraction

The biomass from each isolate was obtained by filtering
the mycelial growth developed in GYE medium (glucose
2%, yeast extract 1%), and DNA was obtained as
described by Reyes-Montes et al. [27].
PCR

The reaction was carried out utilizing the oligonucleotides reported by Guedes et al. [28] with the following
modifications: in a 25-μL final reaction volume, we used
30 ng of genomic DNA, 2.0 mM MgCl2, 200 μM dNTPs
(Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA, USA), 1.0 U
Taq polymerase (Applied Biosystems), and 50 pmol/μL
of each oligonucleotide. The amplification program
comprised one 3-min cycle at 95°C followed by 35 1min cycles at 95°C, 1 min at 55°C, 1 min at 72°C, and a
final 5-min cycle at 72°C to ensure full extension of all
amplified products. The amplified products were analyzed in 1.5% agarose gel. Electrophoresis was conducted
at 100 V in TBE 0.5 × buffer. The molecular size

Page 3 of 7

standard employed was 100-bp DNA Ladder (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA).
RAPD-PCR

Random amplification polymerase DNA (RAPD) H. capsulatum DNAs were amplified employing the oligonucleotides 1253 (5′-GTTTCCGCCC-3′) and a double initiator,
1281 (5′ AACGCGCAAC-3′) and 1283 (5′GCGATCCCCA-3′) (Operon Technologies, Inc., Alameda,
CA, USA) according to Kersulyte et al. [29] and Woods et
al. [30]. The reaction was performed according to ReyesMontes et al. [27] and Taylor et al. [31]. Amplicons were
observed by staining the gels with ethidium bromide (10
μg/mL). A 100-bp DNA Ladder (Invitrogen) was utilized
as standard molecular size. Images of the gels were registered in a Synoptics Photodocumenter (Syngene, Cambridge, MA, USA). A dendrogram was constructed from
the molecular profiles obtained to correlate the percentage
of similarity among strains. The dendrogram was generated using the Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA), and Jaccard co-efficient was
estimated from a band presence-and-absence matrix.

Results
Case Studies

The infection site is located in the town of Tamarindos,
Ciudad Cardel, Veracruz state, in a histoplasmosis endemic zone (Figure 1). Average time for symptoms to
appear was 7 to 20 days. Main clinical manifestations
included fever, bouts of dry cough, chest pain, dyspnea
with medium effort, shivering, diaphoresis, myalgias,
arthralgias, headaches, weight loss, nausea, vomiting
(these latter two symptoms are rare in this infection)
[32,33], and an overall deficient health state. The clinical
forms of the disease and organs affected are listed in
Table 1. Disseminated histoplasmosis was considered
when patients had hepatosplenomegaly and elevated
liver enzymes, especially alkaline phosphatase. In all
cases, chest x-rays and high-resolution CT scan showed
micronodular images in both lungs. Moreover, in
patients with disseminated histoplasmosis, the chest CT
scan divulged bilateral retrocaval, prevascular, subcarinal, and hiliar adenopathies, and hepato- and
splenomegaly.
Isolation and Identification of H. capsulatum and detection
of anti-H. capsulatum antibodies

Cytology of the specimens exhibited the yeast phase of
the fungus. Only two isolates were obtained from different patients: LFD, clinical isolate (bronchial lavage), and
EVP clinical isolate (sputum), which were totally identified based on inclusion criteria for the H. capsulatum
(type B colonies) species and its characteristic macroand micromorphology. Serologic results were the following: PT, 1:32 to 1:256; ELISA, >1:320; H and M bands

histoplasmin (>5-mm induration) was noted in all cases.
Molecular Characterization of the Isolates

Molecular identification of the isolates was confirmed by
PCR on amplifying a specific 279 base-pair (bp) band
corresponding to the codifying region for the H. capsulatum-immunodominant M-antigen gene [28] (Figure 2a).

Molecular characterization of the two clinical isolates of
H. capsulatum from VZ was conducted oligonucleotides
1253 (figure 2b) and 1281 and 1283 (figures 2c and 2d)
RAPD-PCR assays. The figure 2d shows the molecular
profiles of these two isolates, compared with those of the
eight H.-capsulatum reference strains. The bands
obtained were located in the 800 to 200-bp range (Figure

2d). Relatedness among isolates through the polymorphic
DNA patterns was analyzed by using the UPGMA program to elaborate a dendrogram (Figure 3) and three
groups, according to RAPD-patterns, were identified.
Group I is made up of two subgroups: subgroup 1a,
which includes VZ (LFD [bronchial lavage] and EVP
[sputum]) isolates, and the EH-53 (HG) reference strain,
which exhibited 100% similarity, while subgroup Ib comprised bat isolates from PL. Both subgroups are related at
85% similarity. Group II comprises of EH-397 and -398
bat isolates from (OC) with 100% similarity between
them. This group is related to group I with 82% similarity. Group III is made up of two subgroups: subgroup
IIIa is formed by EH-317 and EH-437 bat isolates from
MS, with a 100% similarity ratio, and subgroup IIIb consists of isolates from the State of Morelos (EH-449),
which were 73% related to subgroup IIIa strains Finally,
group III is related to the previous groups with 52%
similarity.

Discussion
In Mexico, the first probable outbreak of histoplasmosis
was described and recorded in a Public Health Acts ledger from the state of Nuevo León at the end of the 19th
century (ca. 1885) when certain clinical scenarios were
described that led to the suspicion that there was an
epidemic of this mycosis in mine workers from areas
containing a large amount of bat guano. In 1943, Martínez-Báez reported the first proven case of histoplasmosis in Mexico, while the first officially described
outbreak was observed in subjects who had entered into
“El Refugio”, an abandoned mine located in Lampazos,
Nuevo León; both data were referred by AguirrePequeño [34].

From studies by Aguirre-Pequeño [34] and GonzálezOchoa [9-13], histoplasmosis in Mexico is considered an
occupational disease because a relationship has been
established between severe Primary pulmonary histoplasmosis (PPH) in miners exposed to high concentrations of H.-capsulatum propagules from bat guano.
Histoplasmosis outbreaks have reported with a death
rate as high as 100% in affected individuals [18-20].
Despite that the number of histoplasmosis outbreaks
continues to rise, there are no official records of the
majority of these. The most recent outbreak reported
occurred in Spring-Break student tourists in Acapulco
between March and May 2001 [35]. During this outbreak, H. capsulatum was isolated from compost
employed as fertilizers in ornamental plants at the hotel
where the students stayed [17].
The results of our study show that the patients had
acquired histoplasmosis in the town of Tamarindos,
Ciudad Cardel, Veracruz (Figure 1). Patients’ signs and
symptoms were clearly associated with chest x-ray
images and chest CT scans. The etiological agent was
clearly identified utilizing macro- and micromorphology
and assessment of anti-Histoplasma antibodies, and IDR,
and its identification was confirmed by PCR (Figure 2a).
In addition, using RAPD-PCR, the two isolates were
observed to possess the same polymorphic pattern based
on their genetic material, indicating that the patients
were infected with the same H. capsulatum strain prevalent at this site (Figures 2b and 2c).
In this study, five of the six patients developed disseminated histoplasmosis. The severity of the infection in
these patients can be attributed to factors such as i)
extreme physical effort, ii) inhalation of a large number
of infectious propagules (when digging to find a treasure, the moving of the bat and bird excreta found at the
infection site), iii) long exposure time (patients remained
for 3 full days excavating and sleeping at the same site),
iv) low socioeconomic status of the workers with severe
nutritional and immunological deficiencies, and v) a
probable high virulence of the strains present at the
infection site. The EH-53 reference strain is highly virulent, proceeding from HG, Mexico, and isolated from a
patient with fatally disseminated histoplasmosis.
Although the molecular characterization of isolates was
not carried out in full, 100% similarity (observed in the
dendrogram) between the two VZ isolates and the EH53 strain (Figure 3), and the severity of the patients’
clinical problems, could suggest the presence of the
strain in this geographic area. Several authors have
reported a high virulence rate of H. capsulatum strains
in Mexico [10,11,18,20,36].
Molecular typification of the two isolates from this
outbreak was compared with the polymorphic DNA patterns of strains collected from VZ-neighboring areas.

EVP and LFD isolates presented 100% similarity to the
EH-53 HG strain (Figure 3), which was isolated in 1977;
therefore, the two isolates are considered as probably
the same strain. The EH-53 strain is included in the
Lam A clade (forming a monophyletic group for Latin
America) according to Kasanuga et al. [8]. Due to that
these isolates were not characterized by four genes as
utilized by Kasuga because we did not possess the
appropriate primers, it was not possible to perform a
definitive classification.
The Ciudad Cardel, La Antigua, Municipality, Veracruz (Figure 1), endemic zone where patients acquired
the infection is located in the central coastal zone of the
state of Veracruz at coordinates 19°22′ latitude North
and 96° 22′ longitude West, and at an altitude of 20 m
above sea level. Its climate is warm with an average
temperature of 25°C. Average annual rainfall is 1,500
mm. In this municipality, fauna is mainly comprised of
rabbits, foxes, coyotes, armadillos, raccoons, and bats;
reptiles such as rattlesnakes, migratory birds, and other
birds are often found to be H. capsulatum reservoirs.
The house where the patients slept was surrounded by
trees in which bats and migratory birds roosted overnight. Maintenance of this strain in the environment, in
the neighboring areas of both HG and VZ, could probably be explained by the very important role that bat
guano plays in spreading H. capsulatum, as reported by
Taylor et al. [16], in which the authors mention that
H. capsulatum propagules can be dispersed at different
distances. In general, it appears that bats are the ideal
candidates for spreading H. capsulatum in both short,
as well as in long, distances. The cave-colonizing behavior of bats, their ability to fly, and their habit of
remaining in the same caves for long periods are important factors that explain the dynamics behind the dispersion of the fungus in nature. For example, infected bats
can act as dispersers of the parasite and incorporate the
fungus into new, favorable environments, possibly
through cadavers [15]. Additionally, the wide diversity of
the fauna present, which is characteristic of the infectious site, also contributes importantly to maintenance
of H. capsulatum in the environment.
The therapeutic scheme administered to three patients
was amphotericin B deoxycholate (0.7 mg/kg/day every
7 days), and methylprednisone (1 mg/kg/day every
7 days), prior to administering amphotericin B, to avoid
collateral effects; afterward, itraconazole 600 mg/day
was administered for 3 days, and finally, itraconazole
400 mg/day was given every 12 weeks), while the
remaining three patients were only administered itraconazole (200 mg/day every 12 weeks). Symptoms and
lesions in all patients resolved. The symptomatology of
the febrile respiratory disease is not specific for pulmonary histoplasmosis, and on occasion, a mistaken

Page 6 of 7

diagnosis is reached, with subsequent administration of
the inappropriate treatment.

Conclusions
The two isolates were observed as possessing the same
polymorphic pattern, indicating that the patients were
infected with the same H. capsulatum strain prevalent
at this site. It is important to remain updated on recent
outbreaks of histoplasmosis and the manner of exposure
to the fungi, as well as to emphasize molecular characterization of isolates located in this endemic zone. The
severity of cases indicates that these strains are highly
virulent, and it is probable that these isolates are prevalent in Hidalgo and Veracruz states. People residing in
or visiting this endemic area should be aware of the
health risks of histoplasmosis infection to which they
might be subjected, to as well as health care personnel
for them to exercise the necessary preventive measures.
