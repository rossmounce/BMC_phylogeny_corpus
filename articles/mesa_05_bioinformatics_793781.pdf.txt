Phylogeographic approach focuses in the description and
interpretation of relationships between the genealogy of
populations or closely related species, estimated from
DNA sequences, and the corresponding geographic distributions. Bioinformatics implementation of coalescent
theory predictions has been in the forefront of this field
for some years now, which, on the other hand, has important practical applications such as in conservation genetics
and epidemiology. Sampling and field work is followed
by obtaining data in the wet lab (usually a longer-thanexpected period) and by the use a panoply of computer
programs to determine phylogenetic relationships of the
sequences and/or specimens collected, estimating gene
flow within populations, inferring historical events and
population dynamics. Different methodologies implemented in several computer packages are available. For
the average Ph-student, several questions soon arise: what
methodology and which programs to use? Assumptions
and limitations of those? How to assess the reliability of
the results obtained? We present data on studies focused
in the phylogeography and population dynamics of beetles endemic to the Canary Islands. Inferences obtained of
inter-island colonisations; population expansions and
restricted gene flow within particular islands are assessed
in the light of available ecology and geology data of the
archipelago. The results obtained show the benefits and
potential perils of this approach applied to low-vagility
organisms in oceanic islands.
