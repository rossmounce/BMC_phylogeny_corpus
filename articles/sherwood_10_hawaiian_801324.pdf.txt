Abstract
Background: The Hawaiian red algal flora is diverse, isolated, and well studied from a morphological and
anatomical perspective, making it an excellent candidate for assessment using a combination of traditional
taxonomic and molecular approaches. Acquiring and making these biodiversity data freely available in a timely
manner ensures that other researchers can incorporate these baseline findings into phylogeographic studies of
Hawaiian red algae or red algae found in other locations.
Results: A total of 1,946 accessions are represented in the collections from 305 different geographical locations in
the Hawaiian archipelago. These accessions represent 24 orders, 49 families, 152 genera and 252 species/
subspecific taxa of red algae. One order of red algae (the Rhodachlyales) was recognized in Hawaii for the first
time and 196 new island distributional records were determined from the survey collections. One family and four
genera are reported for the first time from Hawaii, and multiple species descriptions are in progress for newly
discovered taxa. A total of 2,418 sequences were generated for Hawaiian red algae in the course of this study 915 for the nuclear LSU marker, 864 for the plastidial UPA marker, and 639 for the mitochondrial COI marker. These
baseline molecular data are presented as neighbor-joining trees to illustrate degrees of divergence within and
among taxa. The LSU marker was typically most conserved, followed by UPA and COI. Phylogenetic analysis of a
set of concatenated LSU, UPA and COI sequences recovered a tree that broadly resembled the current
understanding of florideophyte red algal relationships, but bootstrap support was largely absent above the ordinal
level. Phylogeographic trends are reported here for some common taxa within the Hawaiian Islands and include
examples of those with, as well as without, intraspecific variation.
Conclusions: The UPA and COI markers were determined to be the most useful of the three and are
recommended for inclusion in future algal biodiversity surveys. Molecular data for the survey provide the most
extensive assessment of Hawaiian red algal diversity and, in combination with the morphological/anatomical and
distributional data collected as part of the project, provide a solid baseline data set for future studies of the flora.
The data are freely available via the Hawaiian Algal Database (HADB), which was designed and constructed to
accommodate the results of the project. We present the first DNA sequence reference collection for a tropical
Pacific seaweed flora, whose value extends beyond Hawaii since many Hawaiian taxa are shared with other tropical
areas.

Background
The Rhodophyta, or red algae of Hawaii represent one of
the best studied red algal floras worldwide from a morphological perspective [1], making it an ideal flora for
molecular characterization. Endemism estimates for the
marine (19.5%) and freshwater (20.0%) algal floras of the

islands are based on species lists from compiled traditional
taxonomic surveys, and the potential for unrecognized
genetic diversity is high [1,2]. It is almost certain that
these estimates will change as molecular techniques are
applied on a more routine basis to the Hawaiian flora and
in other areas of the tropical Pacific. Until this survey, only
a small proportion of the published studies of Hawaiian
Rhodophyta employed molecular approaches, although
those few resulted in substantial taxonomic revision to the
Hawaiian representatives of the genera Akalaphycus,

Galaxaura, Ganonema and Liagora [3-5]. Additionally, a
new red algal order (the Pihiellales) was described from
Hawaiian material as a result of molecular phylogenetic
analyses [6].
There has also been a bias toward the study of large,
conspicuous members of the Hawaiian seaweed flora
[1]. The red algae, however, display a vast array of
morphologies and reproductive strategies [7], and the
breadth of this diversity is often overlooked in general
survey efforts. It is certain that more concentrated
study of the less conspicuous turf and crustose
morphologies, as well as the epiphytic and parasitic
representatives, will yield unrecognized diversity [1,8].
Indeed, examination of a number of red algal taxa
using molecular techniques has revealed cryptic diversity that was previously unrecognized based on morphology and anatomy, e.g. [9,10].
Red algal systematics and taxonomy are fraught with a
number of issues, often making identification difficult.
Since the end of the 19th century, the classification of
red algae has been largely based on female reproductive
anatomy and post-fertilization events [7,11,12]. Later
additions to the suite of taxonomic characters included
the ultrastructure of pit connections between cells [13]
and the use of DNA sequence data [14,15]. Current red
algal systematics usually employs a blend of biological,
morphological and evolutionary species concepts,
depending on the subgroup under study. For example,
although the ability to interbreed and produce fertile
offspring is not usually explicitly tested in phycological
studies, some researchers have shown the biological species concept to be applicable [16,17]. Morphology continues to play a key role in red algal systematics,
although these data are now typically viewed in an evolutionary context, and the inclusion of molecular data
has become commonplace in the last two decades.
The traditional system of relying exclusively on reproductive characters for taxonomic purposes has several
disadvantages. These characters can be evaluated only
for those taxa that undergo sexual reproduction, which
may be encountered rarely in some taxa. Furthermore, a
number of red algae from Hawaii are believed to be
strictly asexual, including the genera Stylonema, Chroodactylon, Erythrocladia, Erythrotrichia, Compsopogon
and Hildenbrandia [1,18,19]. For others, only asexual
stages have been found in Hawaii, even though they are
known to be sexually reproductive in other geographical
regions (e.g. Peyssonnelia [1]). Some taxa are also highly
seasonal in their timing of reproduction, meaning that
collections must be made in a narrow window of the
year to observe the necessary characters (e.g. Acrosymphyton, Dudresnaya and Naccaria [1]). Still other taxa
rarely undergo sexual reproduction, with no apparent
seasonal pattern (e.g. Acrochaetium [1]).

Heteromorphic taxa (those with morphologically
distinct gametophyte and sporophyte life history phases)
present another challenge for red algal systematics and,
in Hawaii, include members of the Bangiales, Batrachospermales, Bonnemaisoniales, Gigartinales and some
members of the Nemaliales [1,2,20]. Until recently,
researchers have relied on culturing methods to link
heteromorphic counterparts of the same taxon, and this
approach has had profound impacts on the taxonomy of
red algae [21,22]. A number of taxa in the Hawaiian
Islands are known for which these two phases are spatially separated and morphologically distinguishable, and
collecting often results in the recovery of only one of
these phases. Often the gametophyte is the more conspicuous of the two generations, as an upright phase,
while the tetrasporophyte is an overlooked filamentous
or crustose stage [1,23]. In cases like these, DNA
sequences associated with each morphological specimen
can reveal molecular identity of morphologically distinct
life history stages.
Biodiversity research is based on the ability to apply
taxonomic names to collections. This is often not simple for the red algae, for reasons described above.
DNA barcoding is a more recent development in biodiversity studies that has the potential to allow greater
discrimination among cryptic species than traditional
taxonomic methods. DNA barcodes are short, speciesspecific DNA sequences from one or more genetic
loci, allowing for differentiation of individuals at the
species level [24]. The purpose of a DNA barcode is to
assign unknown individuals to species and to enhance
the discovery of new species [25,26], both of which are
fundamental aims of this project. One of the major
components of the present study is the acquisition and
analysis of short DNA marker sequences from the
nuclear (partial 28 S rRNA gene, or LSU [27]), plastidial (partial 23 S rRNA gene, Universal Plastid Amplicon, or UPA [28,29]) and mitochondrial (partial
cytochrome c oxidase I gene, or COI [9]) genomes of
Hawaiian red algae to assess intraspecific variation and
to provide a DNA sequence framework for the Hawaiian Rhodophyta.
The Hawaiian Rhodophyta Biodiversity Survey
(2006-2010) was undertaken to document and archive
the marine, freshwater and terrestrial red algae of the
Hawaiian Islands with an unprecedented depth of analysis and coverage by vouchering morphological samples
and total genomic DNA extracts and undertaking an
assessment of DNA sequence diversity for as many samples as possible. Compilations of freely available taxonomic data sets such as this fulfil the mandate of the
âBiodiversity Commonsâ [30]. Resulting archived collections are invaluable for studies into the phylogenetic
relationships among taxa, species-level descriptions of

the flora, preliminary population genetic analyses, and
biogeographic studies within the Hawaiian Islands and
among other tropical Pacific island systems.
The Hawaiian archipelago extends in a northwesterly
direction for almost 2,400 km, includes a series of small
islands, atolls and seamounts [31], and is well known as
a center of endemism and biological uniqueness [32]. In
2006 the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands were declared
the Papahanaumokuakea National Marine Monument,
and this large portion of the archipelago is understudied
for most algae. An imminent need exists to document
the biodiversity of this unique island chain in the face of
threats from ongoing alien and/or invasive species, algal
blooms, climate change and corresponding sea-level rise
[33,34]. Characterizing native biodiversity provides
essential baseline data for future detection of algal introductions, and for monitoring changes in assemblages at
particular sites. To this end, we undertook a series of
collecting expeditions and analyses to document the
Hawaiian red algal diversity, and here present a
summary of our findings.

Results
Diversity of sampling locations

A total of 305 sites were sampled in the Hawaiian
Rhodophyta Biodiversity Project; 293 from the Main
Hawaiian Islands (MHI) and 12 from the Northwestern
Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) (Figure 1, Additional file 1).
The vast majority of the collecting sites were marine or
brackish (290), while a much smaller number of freshwater (13) and terrestrial (2) locations were also
included. Marine and brackish water sites were typically
located in the intertidal and shallow subtidal areas,
although some collections from SCUBA depth (up to ca.
60 m) were also included. Hawaii Undersea Research
Laboratory (HURL) submersible collections (a total of
20 âsitesâ, or container collections) were labelled according to dive and container data and provided representation from Hawaiian deep water habitats, but are not
included in the above site totals since they are not
accompanied by GPS data.
Seventeen sites yielded large numbers (â¥25) of accessions (red algal individuals), including two from the

island of Hawaii, three from Kauai, three from Maui,
one from Molokai and eight from Oahu (Figure 2).
Although the high number of accessions from these
sites is partly based on accessibility (especially those
from Oahu, which is where the authorsâ laboratories are
based), they are still highly diverse locations that, in
most cases, were surveyed multiple times because of
their impressive numbers of taxa.
Summary of Rhodophyta collections

The vast majority of accessions analyzed were from
marine and brackish locations (1,928), while 16 were
from freshwater habitats and two were from terrestrial
locations. A total of 24 orders, 49 families, 152 genera
and 252 species/subspecific taxa of red algae are represented in the collections (species counts do not include
those identified only to genus as âsp.â). Additional file 2
presents a checklist of taxa collected, identified and analyzed as part of the biodiversity survey, including new
island and state records.
New records reported here do not include most of the
coralline red algae (orders Corallinales and Sporolithales), which are being studied in detail by other
researchers. In our new records, we included specimens
from the Bernice P. Bishop Museum (BISH) that were
not reported in Abbottâs 1999 [1] assessment of distributional records, and also compared our distributional

data to publications since this treatise and to those not
covered therein. Included are those for freshwater red
algae [35-39], descriptions of more recently recognized
species of marine algae (e.g. Dasya atropurpurea [40];
the order Pihiellales [6]) and reports of previously
unrecognized taxa (e.g. marine species of the genus
Hildenbrandia [19]).
One new order of red algae (the Rhodachlyales) was
recorded from our survey collections, although a
number of additional new ordinal names are
applied compared to those listed in Abbott [1] due to
nomenclatural revision and inclusion of previously
unreported taxa (i.e. the orders Acrosymphytales,
Batrachospermales, Colaconematales, Compsopogonales, Halymeniales, Hildenbrandiales, Nemastomatales, Peyssonneliales, Pihiellales, Plocamiales,
Rhodachlyales, Sporolithales, Stylonematales and Thoreales). The family Rhodachlyaceae is reported for the
first time, as are the genera Chroothece, Madagascaria,
Pseudobangia and Rhodachlya. Species designations for
most of these newly reported genera are still being
assessed, but it is likely that many of them represent
undescribed species. Many new island distributional
records (196 in total) were determined from the survey
collections (Additional file 2).
Abbott [1] listed 343 species of marine red algae in
the Hawaiian Islands, of which 218 were also identified

evidenced by the abundance of high divergences, or
long branches), the LSU marker being relatively divergent at higher taxonomic levels but conserved for closely related species, and the UPA marker being
approximately twice as conserved as COI, but with a
similar topological pattern (Figure 4).

DNA sequence diversity of Hawaiian Rhodophyta

Sequence data for each of the three markers sequenced
(UPA, COI and LSU) were employed to investigate the
molecular diversity of Hawaiian red algae. Sequence
diversity for each sampled taxon for the three markers
is presented as a series of neighbor-joining (NJ) trees in

the Bangiales, Compsopogonales, Erythropeltidales and
Stylonematales, since very few sequences were obtained).

Taxa are grouped by order (or groups of related orders),
or by family (or parts of families, or groups of families)
in the case of the Ceramiales (due to tree size). Since
only short molecular markers were used (COI, which is
employed as the DNA barcode for red algae [9,41] and
UPA and LSU, which are also <700 bp in length), we
did not attempt to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships among our collections for the individual marker
data sets, nor assess branch support, but instead focused
on patterns of diversity for species and groups of closely
related species (i.e. DNA barcoding analyses [9,41,42]).
Thus, higher order relationships in the NJ sequence
diversity trees should not be evaluated.
Some trends of marker utility are evident. Overall, a
pattern of #LSU sequences > #UPA sequences > #COI
sequences was observed in a number of instances,
including for the Acrosymphytales, Gigartinales, Nemastomatales, Peyssonneliales, Plocamiales and Pihiellales

to this, the large number of COI sequences for the

analyses, in order to clarify which of these processes
accounts for the diversity observed in the NJ trees.

Discussion
The Hawaiian Rhodophyta Biodiversity Survey yielded
only a few new taxonomic records for the Hawaiian
Islands, but many new distributional records. The flora
has been remarkably well-studied from a morphological
and anatomical perspective, most notably by Abbott [1],
and many of her designations are supported by our
molecular investigations. However, many taxa have also
been revealed to be in need of in-depth taxonomic
study based on our molecular survey data due to
instances of suspected cryptic or incipient speciation (e.
g. Amansia glomerata and Spyridia filamentosa; see
results for full list), or conspecificity (e.g. Gracilaria
eppihippisora and G. salicornia). As such, our survey
data provide a unique opportunity to flag Hawaiian red
algal taxa for further study. Although identification of
these taxonomic issues, rather than full resolution, was
the goal of the Hawaiian Rhodophyta Biodiversity Survey, several of these flagged taxa have been investigated
in detail under the auspices of the project (e.g.
[8,10,43]), and we hope that other researchers will be
able to make use of the data for similar purposes, for it
is detailed taxonomic studies that will ultimately lead to
a floristic revision of the Hawaiian red algae. Also, additional taxonomic expertise for some of the lineages of
red algae investigated during the project (in particular,
for many of the Ceramiales), will be needed for taxonomic resolution. However, despite adding relatively few
new taxa to the species list, we have substantially
updated the reported range of many taxa, with 196 new
island-level distributional records included from our
sampling records.
The vast majority of accessions analyzed were from
marine and brackish locations (1,928, or 99%), while 16
were from freshwater habitats and two were from terrestrial locations. This breakdown is close to the accepted
consensus that, worldwide, approximately 97% of red
algal species are marine [46].

both their degree of conservation and ease of amplification/sequencing, based on the protocols that were
applied to our survey samples. Since the Hawaiian

Rhodophyta Biodiversity Survey encompassed an evolutionarily diverse set of samples, and we aimed to generate a large number of sequences (i.e. >2,000), we were
constrained by the need for minimal variations of protocol for each marker (including primer design, PCR cocktail components/concentrations and amplification

conditions). The LSU and UPA markers were sequenced
without modification (i.e. according to the primers and
conditions described in [27] and [29] respectively), and
these first two markers yielded the highest and second
highest overall number of sequences, respectively. In
contrast, the COI marker required the design of an
additional reverse primer, and yielded the lowest number of sequences. Ease of data acquisition and performance characteristics of each of the three markers are
further examined and discussed in [47], as well as below.
All clean sequences (those with clearly readable chromatograms that could be assembled with confidence)
were retained in HADB, regardless of whether or not
they corresponded to the taxon under study; contaminant sequences (e.g. from epiphytes) were re-labelled as
such and given new accession numbers. All three markers yielded some contaminant sequences, but the UPA
marker yielded the highest number (30), followed by
LSU (15) and COI (7).
The LSU marker was the simplest for which to reliably
obtain clean sequence data; only a single pair of primers

was needed, and most samples were successfully
sequenced on the first attempt. The disadvantage of the
LSU marker, however, was a lack of reliable species-level
resolution (e.g. Figure 21, Nemaliales LSU sequence data
show no divergence between some members of the genera
Akalaphycus, Ganonema, Izziella, Liagora and Trichogloea). A recent investigation of the characteristics and
phylogenetic âperformanceâ of the LSU, UPA and COI
markers based on this same data set confirmed that the
LSU marker is the most conserved of the three, that it was
the easiest for which to obtain sequence data, and illustrated that florideophyte red algal sequence data for the
marker became saturated at F84 distances of approximately 0.30 (although there was variation when individual
orders were examined) [47]. The LSU marker was
included in the survey to provide representation from the
nuclear genome (both the UPA and COI are organellar
markers). However, given that the level of resolution for
the LSU marker differs so strongly from the other two
markers (Figure 4), it would be difficult to recommend its
inclusion in future biodiversity surveys.

The UPA marker, which was first described in 2006
[28] and tested for a selection of algal lineages in 2007
[29], can be amplified and sequenced for most cyanobacterial and plastid-containing algal lineages, with only
a few genus-level exceptions noted to date (e.g. Cladophora, Symbiodinium). This universality is exceptional
among algal primers, and lends great potential for the
use of this marker in assessment of environmental samples that contain multiple algal lineages [48]. For this
reason, we believe it is important to continue to generate framework data for this marker for as many algal
representatives as possible. Recent work has shown that
the UPA marker falls between in the COI and LSU markers in terms of ease of data acquisition, that it is quite
conserved (although slightly less so than LSU), and that
saturation is not an issue for any group of the florideophyte red algae based on UPA sequences [47].
The COI marker was somewhat more difficult to
amplify and sequence across red algal lineages, and two
combinations of primers were used to obtain the 639
sequences reported here (although new primers have
been designed recently that are generally more successful; G.W. Saunders, pers. comm.). Others have reported
requiring up to seven primer combinations to obtain
COI sequences for samples within a single family of red
algae [49]. However, the COI marker is widely recognized as the DNA barcode for red algae [9,41,49], and
as such, provides a useful sequence data set due to the
immediate comparative power of COI sequences against
the 11,925 red algal DNA barcode sequences in the Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) v.2.5 database
(accessed 05 November 2010 [50]). This trade-off
between universal amplification and resolution has been
noted in the past [42,49]. We recently reported that
these COI florideophyte red algal sequence data were
the most difficult of the three markers to obtain (i.e.
low ease of acquisition), but that the COI marker is the
least conserved (and is especially variable at the third
codon position), and that saturation of the entire data
set occurs at F84 distances of approximately 0.11
(although this number varies substantially depending on
which order is being examined) [47].
Maximum likelihood analysis of the concatenated LSU
+UPA+COI sequences yielded a phylogenetic tree that
included support for most of the florideophyte red algal
orders and families included in the data set (i.e. 3/17
orders and 4/37 families were not recovered as monophyletic; Figure 40). A number of explanations may be
responsible for the lack of full resolution in the phylogeny, including insufficient sequence data [47,51], insufficient taxonomic representation, or unresolved
identifications of some specimens. Verbruggen et al.
[51], in their recent research on the data requirements
for resolving the red algal tree of life, indicated that up

Page 24 of 29

to 2.8 Ã 10 5 nucleotides of sequence data may be
required to resolve some regions of the phylogeny,
which is orders of magnitude more data than that provided by our concatenated three-marker data set. We
[47] preliminarily evaluated the phylogenetic performance of the three markers with the same data set by
assessing changes in neighbour-joining bootstrap support with the addition of marker data (progressing from
UPA, to UPA+LSU, to UPA+LSU+COI), and also concluded that the fully concatenated phylogeny was supported largely at the family and ordinal level, with
higher level relationships not resolved. Nonetheless, the
sequences of the three markers will make a valuable
addition to the red algal species assignment framework
of data, and in concatenated form are useful for examining phylogenetic relationships at lower taxonomic levels.
Considering the taxa studied using statistical parsimony analysis (Figure 41), the debate arises as to
whether observed breaks in networks represent strong
phylogeographic signal or species boundaries. It has
been suggested that the 95% connection limit under statistical parsimony, which is commonly used in phylogeographic studies, is a useful criterion for indicating
biological species boundaries [52]. Applying this criterion to our analyses suggests that cryptic species may be
common in the Hawaiian red algal flora. Only one of
the four taxa investigated formed a single haplotype network at the 95% connection limit (Dasya iridescens),
while the remaining taxa formed two (Asparagopsis taxiformis and Dichotomaria marginata) or three networks
(Amansia glomerata). If this pattern holds true for a
number of other Hawaiian red algal taxa (which will
only be determined as more taxa are studied in depth),
then there may be many more species than currently
recognized in the flora. Sorting out phylogeographic signal from species boundaries requires an understanding
of the limits of phenotypic plasticity for each case. Most
of our identifications were made, at least preliminarily,
based on morphology and anatomy. We largely relied
on the detailed descriptions of Abbott [1] but supplemented these with more recent or taxon-specific studies
that were relevant to each taxon (a list of this additional
literature can be found in [44]). Nonetheless, lately there
have been a number of cases in the phycological literature where cryptic species complexes have been revealed
through molecular data, and in a number of these
instances other characters (morphological, anatomical,
life history, physiological, etc.) have later been identified
that allowed recognition of the species on grounds other
than molecular data, e.g. [49,53]. More detailed phylogeographic, morphological/anatomical and life history
analyses of suspected species complexes will be necessary for confirmation, but the DNA sequences from the
present survey provide a valuable starting point for

Sherwood et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:258
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/258

identification of these phenomena, and pave the way for
taxonomic revision of the floristic checklist.
Interestingly, not all common Hawaiian Rhodophyta
species have notable intraspecific sequence variation.
Eight taxa representing three different orders (Table 1)
were reported to have little to no sequence divergence
for the three markers sequenced. Although these taxa
require stronger sampling for confirmation and resolution of these trends, one important finding from the
survey is that phylogeographic patterns are likely to
vary, even for taxa considered to be native to the Hawaiian Islands, and that histories of individual taxa need to
be studied (e.g. time since colonization or speciation,
colonization order of the islands, interisland dispersal
vectors, introduction events from other regions) to
obtain a fuller understanding of intraspecific molecular
patterns. It does not seem to be the case that increased
within-taxon sampling will always reveal obvious phylogeographic patterns. This difference could be due to
many factors, including the length of time since colonization of the species (or speciation, in the case of endemic taxa), ease of dispersal, dispersal vectors and type of
life history (i.e. whether there is an easily spread life history stage, such as a floating, filamentous form), habitat
and physicochemical parameter tolerances.
Ekrem et al. [54] emphasized that DNA barcode data
will only ever be as useful as the reference library of
sequences against which comparisons are made. This is
a compelling argument for support of biodiversity surveys of entire floras, such as this one, that attempt to
account for the diversity of a region with both morphological and molecular sequence characterizations, and
that make these data available to others in easily-accessible formats for comparisons. Zhang et al. [55], however,
rightly point out that sample sizes for most DNA barcode studies are insufficient to assess genetic diversity of
a species, and the level of intraspecific sampling for our
project is no exception. Given the limited time and
funds for the survey, we aimed to strike a balance
between representation of as many taxa as possible and
sufficient coverage of common taxa to assess intraspecific diversity. We emphasize that the patterns discussed
here are largely preliminary, and that a more thorough
examination is warranted to reveal the full story.
The value of the Hawaiian Rhodophyta Biodiversity
Survey is multifaceted: through this project we have generated baseline molecular diversity data for much of the
flora, revealed taxa requiring further systematic investigation (both in terms of possible cryptic species that have
not been previously recognized, and morphologically/
molecularly similar taxa that may be synonymous), begun
to elucidate phylogeographic patterns for Hawaiian red
algae, revised the species checklist for Hawaiian Rhodophyta, and reported a number of new records (both

taxonomic and distributional). All of these data (our own
collections plus those from BISH), as well as photographs
and micrographs, specimen details and collecting site
information, are available via the publicly accessible
Hawaiian Algal Database [56], and the data have also
been shared with the Global Biodiversity Information
Facility [57] and GenBank [58]. Voucher specimens and
the DNA extract library are available to other researchers, enhancing the long-term value of the survey collections. The value of the survey will also increase as other
studies make use of the data and our initial observations
are developed into additional projects.

Conclusions
Here we describe the principal findings of the Hawaiian
Rhodophyta Biodiversity Survey, a four-year effort to
inventory and assess the species of red algae from the
Hawaiian Islands. Numerous new taxonomic and distributional records resulted from the collections, which
allowed for an updated taxonomic checklist of Hawaiian
red algae. Three molecular markers (one each from the
nucleus, plastid and mitochondrion) were sequenced for
numerous collections, and the data from each marker
compared to establish baseline molecular diversity profiles for the flora. A number of cases were highlighted
where the molecular data helped to identify taxa or
groups of taxa in need of systematic revision, illustrating
the value of constructing this baseline molecular diversity data set. In the case of widespread and common
species, the sequence data were also helpful in beginning
to elucidate phylogeographic patterns, which differed
substantially depending on the taxon. A maximum likelihood analysis based on concatenated sequence data for
17 red algal orders yielded a tree topology that is largely
consistent with current understanding of red algal phylogeny, but with lower support at deeper nodes, indicating that the DNA barcode-like markers have
phylogenetic utility at and below the ordinal level. The
value of each of the markers for biodiversity surveys was
also assessed, and recommendations made for inclusion
or exclusion in future surveys of algal floras.
Methods
Sampling strategy

Samples were field-collected or subsampled from accessioned material at the Bernice P. Bishop Museumâs Herbarium Pacificum (BISH). Annual collecting expeditions
to the islands of Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Maui, Lanai and
Hawaii were undertaken to survey nearshore coastal
areas and streams. Samples from the Main Hawaiian
Islands of Niihau and Kahoolawe were processed as they
were opportunistically obtained, as were those from the
Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. We aimed to collect
three specimens per species, although there was

Sherwood et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:258
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/258

variation around this number due to rare or, conversely,
extremely widespread taxa.
Sample processing and analysis

Field-collected samples were processed as described in
Sherwood [43]. Samples were examined using light
microscopy (Olympus BX-41 compound microscope
[Olympus, Center Valley, PA, USA] and a Zeiss SteREO
Discovery.v12 stereomicroscope, Carl Zeiss Microimaging Inc., GÃ¶ttingen, Germany). Identifications were
made using the most current sources, with [1] forming
the foundation for identifications and more recent primary literature being added where appropriate [3-6,40].
Material analyzed from BISH was labelled as per the
assigned identification on the herbarium sheet, except in
cases of obvious mis-identification or where microscopic
examination revealed the sample to belong to a different
taxon (herbarium sheets were subsequently annotated to
reflect these changes).
DNA was extracted from field-collected and herbarium material following the methods described in [27].
All DNA extracts are housed in the Hawaiian Algal
DNA Library at the University of Hawaii at Manoa,
which is maintained at -80Â°C in the Sherwood Laboratory. Duplicate DNA extracts of material from herbarium sheets housed at BISH are maintained at Bishop
Museumâs Pacific Center for Molecular Biodiversity.
Three short DNA markers were amplified and
sequenced for as many of the collections as possible;
these markers were selected to represent different genomes within the cell (i.e. nucleus - part of the 28 S
rRNA gene (LSU), plastid - the Universal Plastid Amplicon (UPA) [28,29], and mitochondrion - the cytochrome
oxidase I barcode region (COI) [9]). PCR primers and
cycling conditions used for each of the markers are
referenced in [27], with information on additional LSU
and COI primer derivation as follows.
We aligned the entire GenBank content for Rhodophyta LSU (>650 sequences ranging from ~800-2700
bp) and designed primers to amplify a central portion
where most of the data overlapped. These primers,
nu28SF (5â-GGAATCCGCYAAGGAGTGTG-3â; Tm =
56.9Â°C) and nu28SR (5â-TGCCGACTTCCCTTA
CCTGC-3â; Tm = 59.7Â°C) produced an amplicon of variable length; 580-650 bp depending on the taxon. Cycling
conditions for this amplicon were as follows: 94Â°C for 2
min, 40 cycles of 94Â°C for 20 s, 55Â°C for 30 s, 72Â°C for
50 s, and a 5 min final extension at 72Â°C.
We experienced inconsistent sequencing results for
COI using the published primer pair GazF1-GazR1 [9].
For the same PCR product, reverse chromatograms
(GazR1) were regularly lower in quality than the forward
reads (GazF1). We suspect that GazR1 polyA 3âend (5âACTTCTGGATGTCCAAAAAAYCA-3â; Tm = 53.9Â°C)

Page 26 of 29

poses specificity problems, mispriming and/or mismatching with several polyTs located near the GazR1 priming
site. A search for suitable priming sites in the first 863 bp
of COI did not reveal any single 10-15-bp unit fully conserved across red algal taxa, making the design of universal
primers a challenge. However, we identified a GC-rich
region nested upstream of GazR1 containing successive
CCs and GGs, theoretically offering stronger specificity
(Figure 42). We designed an alternate reverse primer
within this region, R686 5â-CCACCWGMAGGATCAA-3â
(Tm = 49.7Â°C). GazF1-R686 produces an amplicon of 616
bp (vs. 720 bp for GazF1-GazR1) that still contains the 500
bp required by BOLD for barcode designation [50]. We
prioritized amplifying with GazR1 for the longer amplicon
it produces, and used R686 to re-sequence low quality
reads and/or re-attempt amplification when the former
failed. PCR thermal profiles were optimized for COI with
GazF1-R686: 94Â°C for 1.5 min, 40 cycles of 94Â°C for 30 s,
47Â°C for 40 s, 72Â°C for 40 s, and a 5 min final extension at
72Â°C. PCR products were purified and sequenced, and
resulting chromatograms manually assembled according to
previously published protocols [27].
Data storage and dissemination

All relevant project data (photographs and micrographs,
locality information, DNA sequences, identifications,
voucher type and archival information) were entered
into the Hawaiian Algal Database (HADB); a database
that was specially designed and constructed for the project to allow organization and accessibility of the data.
HADB is internet accessible at http://algae.manoa.
hawaii.edu and is fully described in [59].
Data analyses
Mapping of GPS data

Collection locality data (GPS points) were downloaded
from HADB and plotted on a map of the Hawaiian
Islands using GPS Visualizer [60]. All coastal, freshwater
and terrestrial MHI points were included, while those
from the NWHI were excluded since most were only at
island-scale resolution.
Construction of DNA sequence diversity trees

Sequences for each marker were downloaded from
HADB and aligned using Clustal X [61]. Neighbor-joining trees of sequences for the UPA, COI and LSU markers were constructed based on the maximumlikelihood composite model in MEGA v.4 [62]. Separate
trees were constructed for each marker, and for each
red algal order (or groups of related orders when sample
numbers were low enough to still visualize taxon labels
on trees), or by family (in the case of the order
Ceramiales, which accounts for approximately half of
the Hawaiian red algal diversity). Summary labels
were added to the trees to indicate the following: a)

Sherwood et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:258
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/258

previously identified lineages of species from the literature (in these cases the citations are given in the figure
legends), b) groups of sequences that, to the best of our
knowledge, belong to the same species although some
sequence divergence is present (e.g. Chroodactylon
âornatumâ; Figure 5), c) groups of sequences that do not
have a consistent taxonomy but nonetheless likely represent a single taxon (e.g. Platoma sp.; Figure 16), and d)
groups of sequences that do or do not have a consistent
taxonomy and likely represent multiple species (e.g.
Peyssonnelia spp.; Figures 16 and 17).
Phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequence data

All accessions for which sequences of all three markers
were available (n = 284) were concatenated using the
software package APE [63] with R [64]. Fast evolving
loops of LSU (indel rich regions) were removed because
sequence homology could not be ascertained with confidence, leaving only stems for this marker. Similarly, a
very short segment of UPA, which aligned ambiguously
on the scale of the entire data set, had to be removed.
Concatenated sequences were analyzed with the rapid
bootstrap (RBS) and maximum likelihood (ML) search
algorithm of the RAxML Blackbox server http://phylobench.vital-it.ch/raxml-bb/ [65]. RAxML uses a hillclimbing algorithm that searches the tree space using
Lazy Subtree Rearrangement [66] while allowing specification of partitioned models useful for concatenated
data sets. An exploratory analysis of the sequences can
be found in [47] which demonstrates the varying levels
of substitution saturation and substitution rates for
UPA, LSU, and all three codon positions of the COI
marker. Following this five-partition scheme, the
RAxML analysis was launched with a GTR+G4 model
and branch length optimization per partition with the
default 100 RBS. The returned ML tree was summarized
by family and order in MEGA [62] and RBS values
â¥70% were illustrated.
Phylogeographic analyses

Phylogeographic patterns for Amansia glomerata, Asparagopsis taxiformis, Dichotomaria marginata and Dasya
iridescens (representatives of widespread Hawaiian red
algae with evident structuring at the molecular level)
were estimated using COI marker sequences (which is
commonly used for phylogeographic inference, e.g. [24]
and the statistical parsimony method of Templeton et
al. [67] using TCS v.1.21 [68], employing a 95% connection limit and treating gaps as a 5 th state. Sequence
divergences for the widespread taxa Acanthophora pacifica, Champia parvula, Coelothrix irregularis, Haliptilon
subulatum, Laurencia majuscula, Lithophyllum insipidum, Polysiphonia howei and Tolypiocladia glomerulata
were calculated based on p-distances using MEGA v.4
[62] and reported as percent identities.
