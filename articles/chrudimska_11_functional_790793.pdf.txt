isoforms of the hard tick Ixodes ricinus

Abstract
Background: The immune system of ticks is stimulated to produce many pharmacologically active molecules
during feeding and especially during pathogen invasion. The family of cationic peptides - defensins - represents a
specific group of antimicrobial compounds with six conserved cysteine residues in a molecule.
Results: Two isoforms of the defensin gene (def1 and def2) were identified in the European tick Ixodes ricinus.
Expression of both genes was induced in different tick organs by a blood feeding or pathogen injection. We have
tested the ability of synthetic peptides def1 and def2 to inhibit the growth or directly kill several pathogens. The
antimicrobial activities (expressed as minimal inhibition concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration
values) against Gram positive bacteria were confirmed, while Gram negative bacteria, yeast, Tick Borne Encephalitis
and West Nile Viruses were shown to be insensitive. In addition to antimicrobial activities, the hemolysis effect of
def1 and def2 on human erythrocytes was also established.
Conclusions: Although there is nothing known about the realistic concentration of defensins in I. ricinus tick body,
these results suggest that defensins play an important role in defence against different pathogens. Moreover this is
a first report of a one amino acid substitution in a defensins molecule and its impact on antimicrobial activity.

Background
Ticks are known as vectors of severe human and animal
diseases caused by viruses, bacteria and protozoa. Their
immune system offers effective mechanisms against
pathogenic microorganisms in the event of their permeation into the tick body. Some pathogen species (Babesia
sp., Borrelia sp., Tick Borne Encephalitis Virus, etc.) can
survive and colonize tick tissues and to be further transmitted to animal or human hosts during feeding [1].
The immune system of ticks and other arthropods possesses two sets of immune responses. The first one
includes cellular responses represented by hemocytes and
including encapsulation, nodulation and phagocytosis [2,3].
Hemocytes were shown to be one of the sites of immune
molecule synthesis that play a role in humoral immune
pathways [4]. The second set of immune responses in ticks
consists of humoral responses, which involve the proteins
that represent molecular factors of self/non-self recognition
as well as effector molecules.

Defensins, naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides
(AMPs), form the first line of defense against pathogens
and have been found in a broad spectrum of living organisms: plants [5], mammals [6], insects [7-9], scorpions [10],
mollusks [11] and several tick species [12-21]. Invertebrate
defensins were first isolated from cultured cells of the
flesh fly Sarcophaga peregrina [7]. Their amino acid
sequence shows conservations across a broad phylogenetic
range (ticks, insects, mollusks, and scorpions) suggesting
these AMPs are relatively ancient effectors of innate
immunity. Arthropod defensins are generally cationic
AMPs having six cysteine residues forming disulfide
bridges with the same pairing Cys1-Cys4, Cys2-Cys5, and
Cys3-Cys6 [22]. In ticks, defensins are mainly expressed in
the midgut after blood feeding or pathogen invasion
[14,23,24]. Their antimicrobial activity is primarily directed
against Gram-positive bacteria, but some isoforms are also
effective against Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts and protozoa [24-27]. The initial interaction of defensins with bacterial cytoplasmic membranes involves electrostatic forces
followed by permeabilization of the membranes and subsequently leading to bacterial lysis. It is thought that there
may also be other, secondary, potential targets inside

bacteria cells for cationic AMPs, such as nucleic acids or
some enzymes [25,28].
Recently, multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterial strains
have emerged and have rapidly spread in the environment,
therefore the discovery of a novel class of antibiotics is
urgently needed. During the course of evolution, nature
has generated many molecules with conserved motifs that
may represent specific probes for design of the new therapeutic agents. Characterization of these structures is of
particular interest in order to produce molecules by chemical synthesis or recombinant systems, which may be
candidates for new drug development [29]. Membraneactive cationic AMPs, like defensins, have the potential to
become a new class of antibiotics with a new mode of
interaction and promising therapeutical effects. These peptides are not yet affected by antibiotic-resistance mechanisms and, with various possible targets, the development
of resistance might be difficult [28].

Results
Antimicrobial and hemolytic activities of the synthetic
defensin isoforms

In the preliminary agar diffusion test, both synthetic isoforms of Ixodes ricinus defensin def1 and def2 revealed an
antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria
Staphyloccocus xylosus, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis and a clinical isolate of MDR strain of S. aureus (data
not shown), but did not show any effect on Gram-negative
bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and
yeast (Candida albicans). Subsequently the minimal inhibition concentrations (MICs) and the minimal microbicidal concentrations (MMCs) for selected sensitive bacteria
species were determined. Synthetic def1 and def2 had an
ability to inhibit Gram-positive bacteria in very low concentrations-specifically M. luteus (MIC 0.75 μM and 0.37
μM, respectively), B. subtilis (1.5 μM and 0.75 μM, respectively) and a methicilin resistant clinical isolate of S. aureus

- MRSA (50 μM, and 25 μM, respectively). The minimal
bactericidal concentrations were measured as the ability to
kill 99.9% of bacteria in the culture. Both peptides showed
the ability to kill tested bacteria within one hour, thought
the MMCs of both peptides were slightly higher than the
MICs. The values are summarized in Table 1.
Def1 as well as def2 isofoms exhibited no virucidal effect
on the Tick Borne Encephalitis virus (TBEV), and West
Nile virus (WNV). Moreover, no significant inhibition of
TBEV, and WNV growth in a culture of PS cells was seen
in the presence of the compounds. The only decrease
(approx. 1 log10 pfu/ml) in WNV titer was seen in PS cell
culture at 24 hours post-infection (p.i.) in the presence of
def2 when compared to untreated control. However, no
difference in virus titer between cultures treated with def2
and untreated controls was seen at 48 hours p.i. (data not
shown). In conclusion, I. ricinus defensin isoforms did not
reveal any substantial antiviral activity against TBEV, as a
representative of tick-transmitted viral pathogens, and
WNV, as a representative of mosquito-borne viruses.
To determine the effects of I. ricinus defensins on
mammalian cells, we measured the level of hemolysis
caused by def1 and def2 in concentrations effective at
killing Gram-positive bacteria. The results show that both
peptides are harmless to human erythrocytes in concentrations of up to 12.5 μM (p < 0.05). In these concentrations def1 and def2 caused 2.9% and 2.0% hemolysis,
respectively. The hemolysis rose to 75% and 64.6%
respectively, when the highest concentrations of def1 and
def2 were used (Figure 1).
The amino acid sequences of def1 and def2 differ only
in one amino acid residue in position 8, where phenylalanine exists in case of def1 and arginine in case of def2.
This substitution results in slightly different antimicrobial potential of def1 and def2. Def2 isoform is more
effective in the inhibition of bacteria cell growth and
killing of bacteria than def1 peptide. However, no

Determination of MICs and MMCs for each peptide and bacteria was performed at least 3-times in doublets. Def2 peptide was significantly more efficient in the
inhibition of growing G-positive bacteria (G+) in cultures and in microbicidal experiments. Gram negative bacteria (G-), as well as yeast, WNV and two strains of
TBEV (Hypr and Neudoerfl), were not influenced by these peptides (a no effect up to 50 μM; b no effect up to 100 μM).

Stage- and tissue-specific expression profiles of I. ricinus
defensin isoforms

Semi-quantitative two step RT-PCR was performed to
determine defensin gene expression in all developmental
stages and in selected tissues before and after blood feeding or hemocel injection of different substances. Expression of def1 mRNA was induced by blood intake at all life
stages - larva, nymph and imago, while def2 mRNA
expression was detected only in adult females with a significant increase after a blood meal (Figure 2). Def1 was
expressed in mitgut in both cases-before and after blood
meal, while its expression in Malphigian tubes and ovaries
was induce after blood intake or injection of different

compounds into blood fed female, respectively (see Figure
2, 3a). Results of tissue specific expression patterns analysis for I. ricinus def2 isoform in response to blood feeding,
injection of bacteria or sterile water (Figure 2, 3a,) showed
that expression of def2 isoform was present in midgut and
ovaries of unfed female after injection and blood feeding
was a big stimulus for def2 expression in all tested organs
(Figure 2, 3b) House-keeping gene, b-actin, was expressed
at the same expression levels in all samples (Figure 2, 3c).
Newly designed primers for amplification of I. ricinus
b-actin gene were confirmed as specific not only for I.
ricinus, but also for the I. scapularis and Dermacentor
marginatus b-actin gene. The obtained products were
sequenced and partial sequences of b-actin gene of I.
ricinus and D. marginatus were submitted to GeneBank
(accession no. HQ682101; HQ645110, respectively).

Discussion
Functional characterization of def1 and def2

Molecules involved in the mechanism of innate immunity
of invertebrates are a rich source of potential novel candidates for antibiotic development. Antimicrobial proteins
(AMPs) - mainly defensins, play an important role in
invertebrate immunity pathways. Recently there has been
greater attention paid to this protein family. Here, we present the functional characterization of Ixodes ricinus
defensins (def1, def2), previously described in our lab
[18,19]. Defensins are known to be effective mainly against
Gram-positive bacteria [24,25,27]. Our results confirmed
this statement showing that I. ricinus defensin isoforms
possess an effective antimicrobial activity against Gram
positive bacteria S. xylosus, M. luteus, B. subtilis and
MRSA clinical isolate S. aureus. Def1 and def2 isoforms
show a strong ability to inhibit Gram-positive bacteria
growth in low doses (see Table 1). Furthermore, def1 and
def2 antimicrobials have the advantage of being bactericidal. Within one hour, 99.9% of tested bacteria were killed
and observed MMCs corresponded to MICs, showing

Figure 2 Life cycle and tissue gene expression of I. ricinus def1 and def2 isoforms. Semi-quantitative two steps RT-PCR was performed with
specific primers for each defensin. Tissues for examination were obtained from blood fed female and were as follows: HM-hemocytes, SG-salivary
glands, MG - midguts, MT - Malphigian tubes, OV - ovaries. Negative control was done without cDNA. Life stages of I. ricinustick used were
larvae, nymphs and adult females (N-unfed, F-fed). Gene for tick b-actinwas used as a positive control.

Figure 3 Expression patterns of I. ricinus defensins isoforms def1 (A) and def2 (B) after various stimuli in comparison to house-keeping
gene actin (C). Before (NF) or after a completed blood feeding (BF), ticks were inoculated intrahemocoelly with a suspension of bacteria (E. coli,
M. luteus, O.D.600 = 0.2; Borrelia burgdorferisensu stricto, 4.8 × 107spirochetes/ml; volume 0.5 μl). As a negative control one group of ticks was
injected with the same volume of sterile water. RNA from all groups of ticks was isolated the next day. Expression of genes for def1(A) and def2
(B) were determined by semi-quantitative two steps RT-PCR (30 cycles for BF ticks, 33 cycles for NF ticks) in salivary glands (SG), midgut (MG)
and ovaries (OV). Gene for tick b-actin(C) was used as a positive control (27 cycles).

high efficiency of I. ricinus defensins. Neither def1 nor
def2 affected the growth of tested Gram-negative bacteria
(E. coli and a multi-resistant clinical isolate of P. aeruginosa) and yeast C. albicans in tested concentrations (Tab.
1). Generally, Gram-negative bacteria are more resistant to
treatment of cationic antimicrobial peptides. Their cell
wall, mainly the outer membrane, is known to be an effective permeability barrier [27,30]. It is possible that this is
the reason the peptides cannot directly interact with the
cell membrane. Despite the fact that the majority of findings showed tick defensins as mainly anti Gram-positive
bacteria peptides, longicin, the defensin of the Asian tick
Haemaphysalis longicornis, was also able to inhibit Gramnegative bacteria (P. aeruginosa, E. coli), a fungus (Pichia
pastoris) and merozoites of an intracellular parasite Babesia equi [26]. Weak antibacterial activity of I. persulcatus
defensin was observed against the Gram-negative bacterium E. coli [24].
Bacteria naturally co-existing with the tick, such as the
symbiotic bacterium Stenotrophomonas maltophila

(from the midgut of the tick I. persulcatus), the pathogenic spirochete Borrelia garinii (Ixodes ticks) or I. persulactus- derived Bacillus sp., revealed the natural
resistance to tick defensins [27,31]. Here we have
demonstrated that TBEV (virus derived from I. ricinus
tick) and its life cycle were not influenced by tick defensins def1 and def2. Lyme disease spirochetes (B. garinii),
classified as Gram-negative bacteria, were not sensitive
to defensins synthesized according to the sequences
derived from vector (Ixodes ricinus, def1) and non-vector ticks Haemaphysalis longicornis or Ornithodoros
moubata (defC). [27].
Although the antiviral activity of several defensins
(human, murine) was reported, the I. ricinus defensins
did not substantively influence WNV and its life cycle
in addition to TBEV [32,33].
Therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of multidrug resistant bacteria infections are restricted to antibiotics introduced recently to clinical practice [34].
Recently, many human pathogens have emerged with

Chrudimská et al. Parasites & Vectors 2011, 4:63
http://www.parasitesandvectors.com/content/4/1/63

multi resistance to known antibiotics [35]. Therefore,
the basic antimicrobial testing should be a part of all
research with probable or expected antimicrobial molecules. As was mentioned earlier, I. ricinus def1 and def2
showed antibacterial activity against G-positive bacteria.
A methicilin resistant clinical isolate of S. aureus
(MRSA) was sensitive to these peptides as well. Even if
the MIC and the MMCs values of def1 and def2 peptides against S. aureus (MRSA) were higher than in
other tested Gram-positive bacteria, this finding showed
the ability of defensins to inhibit and kill pathogenic
bacterium with multi-drug resistance. In contrast,
S. aureus strain Wood was more sensitive (MICdef1 40
μg/ml; MW 4231.9; equivalent 9.45 μM concentration)
than the MRSA strain to Ixodes ricinus def1 peptide
treatment [27].
These findings, supplemented by the fact that these
defensins have relative low toxicity to human cells (measured by the degree of red cell hemolysis; Figure 1),
suggest that I. ricinus tick defensins (mainly def2 isoform) are possible candidates for new antimicrobial
(especially anti-MRSA species) drug development with
potential topical application.
Impact of defensin primary structure on its function

The importance of forming the intra-molecular disulphide bonds between six cysteine residues in the defensin
molecule had been reported before and was summarized
by Ganz and Lehrer [22]. Specific S-S formation (between
Cys1 - Cys4, Cys2 - Cys5 and Cys3 - Cys6) is vital for
defensin function. The linear synthetic defensin from
I. persulcatus displayed weak antibacterial activity in the
growth inhibition test in comparison to the folded peptide with a confirmed tertiary structure of the same
defensin peptide [31]. Nevertheless, Tsuji and colleagues
[26] showed that the most important part of defensin
molecule responsible for antimicrobial activity is the
sequence of the C-terminal 20 amino acids. This shorter
peptide (signed as C4 peptide) exerts the same antibacterial activity as a full length and folded recombinant
mature defensin.
Here we have shown that a single amino acid substitution on the N-terminal of defensin molecule also influences the function of the peptide. Def1 and def2 isoforms
differ in position 8 of the amino acid sequences. The substitution affects the ability to kill previously mentioned
bacteria: def2 (Arg8) possesses greater ability to inhibit
bacterial growth and kill bacteria than def1 isoform
(Phe8). While the substitution doesn’t affect the predicted tertiary structure of both peptides (Figure 4a, b),
the peptide surface has changed: the amino acid residues
of Phe8 and Arg8 are present on the surface (see Figure
4c, d). The two peptides also differ in cationicity - def 2

has higher predicted positive charge (7.052; at pH 7.0)
and could probably be more efficient in bacteria cell
membrane depolarization than isoform def1 (6.052; at
pH 7.0).
Defensins expression patterns

During feeding, ticks are naturally exposed to host blood
environment possibly containing infectious agents. Activation of the tick innate immune responses is necessary for a
successful defense against invading pathogens, and consequently for completing blood intake and the life cycle.
Defensins, as a part of humoral immunity pathway, are
induced by many stimuli. They are mainly up-regulated in
the midgut by blood feeding [13,14,24,26]. It is speculative
if defensins may play a role in blood digestion - our results
show that def1 as well as def2 are able to slightly lyse erythrocytes up to 12.5 μM concentration. In our opinion a
more probable explanation for the up-regulation of defensin gene expression after blood intake is the activation of
the immune system due to history events of simultaneously intake of pathogens and blood meal. The results
of gene expressions show defensins as the first line defense
molecules in tick immunity. Gene for def1 was predominantly expressed in the midgut, while def2 was detected in
all tested organs after different treatments. Our observations reveal that the immune system of I. ricinus females
(measured by defensin expression) reacts on different
pathogens almost equally. Analogously, there were reports
of up-regulation of defensins gene expressions after a bacterial treatment in several other ticks. In the soft tick,
Ornithodoros moubata, four defensin isoforms were
induced by injection of different bacteria or bacteria cell
wall components. These O. moubata defensin isoforms
react slightly different to treatment of Gram positive or
Gram negative bacteria [25]. Infection of the hard tick D.
variabilis by Gram-negative bacteria Anaplasma marginale also leads to increasing defensin gene mRNA levels
[23].

Conclusions
In conclusion, I. ricinus defensins (def1, def2) play an
important role in the tick’s innate immunity. Their expression is mainly induced by a blood feeding - the most
important process for pathogen entry. Therefore, the
expression of both defensin isoforms is predominantly
found in the midgut but sometimes in other organs such
as salivary glands or ovaries as well. Both I. ricinus defensin isoforms possess bactericidal properties with potency
predominantly against Gram-positive bacteria; the def2
isoform was found to be more effective in killing bacteria
with the same level of human erythrocyte hemolysis as the
def1 isoform. Generally, with the increasing emergence of
multi-resistant bacteria, tick defensins as well as other

The predicted 3D structures (A, B) show no significant differences, but the amino acids residues of Phe8 (def1) and Arg8 (def2) projected out of the
molecule surface (C, D; respectively). Because the arginine carries out the positive charge, the impact on molecule def2 cationicity is without doubt.
Seeing that the defensins mode of action is a thorough depolarization of the bacteria cytoplasm membrane [25], the cationicity of peptides could be
the explanation for def2 higher efficiency in killing bacteria. The predicted tertiary structures of def1 and def2 peptides were based on the template
1fjnA - 3D structure of defensin MGD-1 from the mollusk Mytilus galloprovincialis[43]. Sequence similarity between MGD-1 and def1, def2 were 48.65%
in both cases.

arthropod defensins can be expected to be introduced to
the medical field as new molecules with antibacterial
activity.

Methods
Tick samples

I. ricinus ticks were provided by the Biological Centre,
Institute of Parasitology, Academy of Science of the
Czech Republic. Uninfected ticks of different life stages
(larva, nymph and imago) were fed on adult guinea pigs
(infection-free animals treated in accordance with the
Animal Protection Law of the Czech Republic no. 246/
1992 Sb). Ticks were collected after completing blood
feeding (self-separation from the animal).
Semi-quantitative two step RT-PCR analysis

Semi-quantitative two-step reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed
to analyze the gene expression of Ixodes ricinus defensins. Total RNA was extracted from all tick samples

using the TRI reagent (Sigma, USA) according to the
manufacturers’ recommendations. RNA samples were
obtained from unfed and fed larvae, nymphs and adult
females and from dissected tissues unfed and fed
females (hemolymph, midgut, salivary glands, ovary, and
Malphigian tubes).
Single strand cDNA was prepared from the total RNA
with random primers (0.2 μg per reaction) using RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (MBI
Fermentas, Lithuenia). Five micrograms of total RNA
was used per each reaction. Synthesis of the first strand
cDNA was carried out at 42°C for 60 minutes according
to the manufacturers’ recommendations.
Primers were designed according to I. ricinus defensin
isoforms sequences previously obtained in our laboratory
[18,19]. The mature defensins isoforms (def 1, def 2) were
amplified using specific primers: Def1ma forward 5’GGT GGC TAC TAC TGC CCA TTT TTT-3’, Def2ma
forward 5’- GGT GGT TAC TAC TGC CCA TTC CG3’. The reverse primer (DefRma) sequence (5’- TCA GAC

GCA GAT GCA GGT CTT TT-3’) was the same for
both defensin isoforms. The tick housekeeping gene
encoding b-actin was used as a control in RT-PCR using
the gen-specific primers; the primers were designed
according to Dermacentor variabilis (EF488512) and Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus (AY255624) actin
sequences and were as follows (forward primer 5’-ATG
TGT GAC GAC GAG GTT GCC GC-3’, reverse primer
5’-GTA CAG CGA CAG CAC GGC CTG G-3’). To
amplify the target gene, the single strand cDNA (150 ng
per reaction) was used. Amplification was performed
with GoTaq Colorless Master Mix (Promega, USA) in 20
μl. PCR conditions were as follows: 5 min at 96°C, followed by 28 cycles at 96°C for 25 s, 53°C (defensins) or
50°C (actin) for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min. Final extension
step was at 72°C for 5 min. PCR was performed in a Mastercycler (Eppendorf, Germany) thermal cycler. Products
of the reaction were separated by electrophoresis on 1.8%
agarose gel electrophoresis.
Def1 and def2 PCR products, as well as the b-actin gene
PCR product, were cut off the gel and purified using the
QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, USA) and subsequently cloned into pCR ® 4-TOPO vector (Invitrogen,
USA) for sequencing to proof defensin isoform primers
specificity. DNA sequencing was performed using ABI
3130 Sequencer and the Big Dye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, USA) with M13 forward/reverse primers. Sequences were analyzed with
DNASTAR software (DNASTAR, United Kingdom).
BLAST programs of the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (Bethesda, USA) were used for similarity
search using the data available in GenBank®.
Preparation of synthetic tick defensins

Peptides def1 and def2 (mature parts, both 37 amino acid
long) were custom synthesized according to putative
amino acid sequences (accession numbers AAP94724 and
ABC88432, respectively) by the Peptide 2.0 Company
(Chantilly, VA, USA). Purification by reversed-phase highperformance liquid chromatography and MS analyses
were performed by the vendor. According to the data
reports supplied with the products, synthetic Def1
(GGYYCPFFQDKCHRHCRSFGRKAGYCGGFLKKTCICV) was 93.84% pure and its molecular weight was
4.237 kDa, while synthetic Def2 (GGYYCPFRQDK
CHRHCRSFGRKAGYCGGFLKKTCICV) was 85.82%
pure and its molecular weight was 4.247 kDa. The products were supplied as lyophilized trifluoroacetate salt
which was stored at -76°C. Before experiments, the peptides were dissolved in PBS buffer containing 0.05%
Tween 20 (Loba Feinchemie, Austria) and 1 μM b-merkaptoethanol (Bio-Rad, CA, USA) to final 1 mM
concentration.

Biological activity assays

Following organisms were used for determination of
basic antimicrobial activity profile: Bacillus subtilis (B. s.)
168, kindly provided by Prof. Yoshikawa (Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, USA); Escherichia coli (E. c.) B No.
CCM 7372 and Micrococcus luteus (M. l.) No. CCM 144
from the Czech Collection of Microorganisms, Brno; Staphylococcus aureus (S. a.) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
(P. a.) were obtained as multi-resistant clinical isolates,
No. 4231 and 8567, respectively, from Liberec Hospital,
Czech Republic; and Borrelia burgdorferi (B.b.) No.
ATCC 35211 from American Type Culture Collection,
Manassas, VA, USA. Yeast, Candida albicans F7-39/
IDE99, kindly provided by the Institute of Organic
Chemistry and Biochemistry, was a clinical strain from a
collection of fungi at the Institute of Microbiology,
Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacký University
Olomouc, Czech Republic. For antiviral activity assay,
two representatives of TBEV (strains Neudoerfl, and
Hypr) and one isolate of WNV were used. The strain
Neudoerfl was originally isolated from I. ricinus tick in
Austria in 1971 [36], and the strain Hypr was isolated
from the blood of a 10-year-old child with tick-borne
encephalitis in 1953 [37]. Low-passage TBEV strains
were used in this study. WNV isolate used in this study is
of unknown origin and underwent 28 passages in brains
of suckling mice.
Antimicrobial assay

Qualitative estimates of the antimicrobial activities of
both synthesized I. ricinus defensin isoforms were performed by the agar dilution double-layer technique. One
hundred micro litters of fresh bacterial culture (approximately 107 colony forming units per Petri dish) prepared
in LB broth were added to 2 ml of melted soft agar (0.5%
LB agar) once temperature decreased to approximately
42°C. Subsequently, soft agar was poured over the surface
of the Petri dish containing 20 ml of 2% LB agar. Synthetic defensins 1 and 2 were diluted to concentration of
100 μM in physiological buffer and one microliter of
either peptide was dropped on the surface of the solidified upper layer containing bacteria. As a negative control, dissolving buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20
and 1 μM b-merkaptoethanol) was used. Plates were
incubated at 37°C overnight.
Minimal inhibition concentratins (MICs)

Quantitatively, MICs were established by observing bacteria growth in multi-well plates. Stock solutions (1 mM)
of def1 and def2 were diluted in LB broth and put into
the wells of multi well plates. Bacteria in mid-exponential
phase were diluted (1 × 10 5 CFU/ml) and added to the
wells with peptides (0.1 ml of diluted peptide and 0.1 ml
of bacteria culture), final peptide concentration ranged
from 0 to 100 μM. Diluted dissolving buffer in LB broth

was used as a negative control. Multi-well plates were
incubated in a Bioscreen C instrument (Helsinki, Finland)
for 20 h (or 24 h for M. luteus) at 37°C, with constant
shaking. The absorbance was measured at 540 nm every
15 min, and each peptide was tested in 3 independent
experiments.

calculated in correlation to negative and positive controls
(%hemolysis = (A N - A 0 /A 100 - A 0 ) × 100; A 0 = 0%
hemolysis in PBS; A 100 = 100% hemolysis obtained by
incubation with 0.2% solution of Triton X-100 in PBS).

Minimal micorbicidal concentrations (MMCs)

The significance of any differences obtained between
def1 and def2 peptides, concentrations used and controls was evaluated by the Mann-Whitney U test, nonparametrical (Statistica 6.0, Statsoft, Inc. Tulsa, USA).
The results represent 5 similar doublet experiments for
hemolytic activity and 3 doublet tests for antimicrobial
activity.

The overnight bacterial cultures of M. luteus, B. subtilis
and S. aureus were subcultured in fresh LB media at 37°C
with shaking to obtain log-phase bacterial cells. Subsequently, bacteria cells were diluted to 1-2 × 106 cells/ml in
PBS (pH 7.4). One hundred microlitres of cell suspension
were mixed with 100 μl of peptide def1 or def2 solutions
(0 - 200 μM) and incubated 1 hour without shaking at
37°C. Afterward the bacteria samples were diluted either
100 or 1000 times, spread on LB agar plates and incubated
overnight at 37°C. Grown colonies were counted, CFU per
ml and percentage of dead bacteria relative to controls
was calculated. MMCs were evaluated as the lowest peptide concentration able to kill 99.9% of bacteria in 3 independent experiments.
Antiviral activity

Virucidal effect of defensin 1 and 2 on TBEV was investigated by incubation of 105 pfu of the virus in L15 medium (3% FCS) in the presence or absence of the def1 and
def2 compounds at final concentration of 100 μM for
1 hour at 37°C. The residual infectivity was determined
by a plaque assay as described previously [38].
The inhibitory effect of def1 and def2 on TBEV replication was investigated on PS cell monolayers (porcine kidney stable) [39]. The cells in 96-well plates were infected
with 105 pfu per well in L15 medium (3% FCS). After one
hour of adsorption at 37°C, the inoculum was removed
by washing the cells with PBS. Subsequently, the cells
were incubated in L15 medium in the presence or
absence of the peptides. The concentration of defensins
used in the experiment was 100 μM. Supernatant media
from the wells were collected at 24 and 48 hours postinfection and stored at -70°C until processing. Virus titer
was determined by the plaque assay as described previously [38].
Hemolytic assay

EDTA-anticoagulated human venous blood was obtained
from 2 young healthy volunteers. Erythrocytes were harvested by centrifugation (2000 rpm, 10 min, and 20°C)
and washed three times with sterile PBS. Suspension of
erythrocytes (2%; vol/vol) was used for the assay. Stock
solution of peptides def 1 and 2 were diluted in PBS and
co-incubated with erythrocytes (37°C, 2 hours) in the
final volume of 200 μl and final concentrations from 0.37
μM to 100 μM. After incubation, the suspension was centrifuged (2000 rpm, 10 min, and 20°C), 100 μl of supernatant was removed, and the absorbance of samples was
measured at 405 nm (AN ). The hemolytic activity was

Statistical analysis

Tertiary structure prediction

For prediction of the 3-D structure of both def1 and
def2 peptides, the Swiss-Model Protein Modeling Server
was used [http://swissmodel.expasy.org/SWISS-MODEL.
html] to find the homologues for I. ricinus molecules. A
pdb file of the molecule (according to the similar
sequences of structures from the protein databank) was
downloaded and used in RasWin Molecular Graphics
program (Version 2.7.5; http://www.rasmol.org/) to view
the 3D structure of both peptides.
