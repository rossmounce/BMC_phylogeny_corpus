Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic patterns show the presence or absence of certain genes or proteins
in a set of species. They can also be used to determine sets of genes or proteins that occur only in
certain evolutionary branches. Phylogenetic patterns analysis has routinely been applied to protein
databases such as COG and OrthoMCL, but not upon gene databases. Here we present a tool
named PhyloPat which allows the complete Ensembl gene database to be queried using
phylogenetic patterns.
Description: PhyloPat is an easy-to-use webserver, which can be used to query the orthologies
of all complete genomes within the EnsMart database using phylogenetic patterns. This enables the
determination of sets of genes that occur only in certain evolutionary branches or even single
species. We found in total 446,825 genes and 3,164,088 orthologous relationships within the
EnsMart v40 database. We used a single linkage clustering algorithm to create 147,922 phylogenetic
lineages, using every one of the orthologies provided by Ensembl. PhyloPat provides the possibility
of querying with either binary phylogenetic patterns (created by checkboxes) or regular
expressions. Specific branches of a phylogenetic tree of the 21 included species can be selected to
create a branch-specific phylogenetic pattern. Users can also input a list of Ensembl or EMBL IDs
to check which phylogenetic lineage any gene belongs to. The output can be saved in HTML, Excel
or plain text format for further analysis. A link to the FatiGO web interface has been incorporated
in the HTML output, creating easy access to functional information. Finally, lists of omnipresent,
polypresent and oligopresent genes have been included.
Conclusion: PhyloPat is the first tool to combine complete genome information with phylogenetic
pattern querying. Since we used the orthologies generated by the accurate pipeline of Ensembl, the
obtained phylogenetic lineages are reliable. The completeness and reliability of these phylogenetic
lineages will further increase with the addition of newly found orthologous relationships within
each new Ensembl release.

Background
Phylogenetic patterns show the presence or absence of certain genes or proteins in a set of species. These patterns
can be used to determine sets of genes or proteins that

occur only in certain evolutionary branches. The use of
phylogenetic patterns has been common practice as
increasing amounts of orthology data have become available. One example is Clusters of Orthologous Groups

(COG) [1] which included a Phylogenetic Patterns Search
(PPS) on its web interface. This phylogenetic pattern tool
was further enhanced with the Extended Phylogenetic Patterns Search (EPPS) [2] tool, providing the possibility of
querying the phylogenetic patterns of the COG protein
database using regular expressions. The newest release of
the OrthoMCL database, OrthoMCL-DB [3], also offers
this possibility. However, suchs tool have only been available for querying proteins, and not for genes. The advantage of looking at gene families instead of protein
families, is that the view on expansions and deletions is
not distorted by any alternative transcripts and splice
forms. The PhIGs [4], Hogenom [5] and TreeFam [6] databases all offer phylogenetic clustering of genes, but do not
have the functionality of phylogenetic patterns. Here we
introduce a web tool named PhyloPat that creates the possibility of querying all complete genomes of the highly
reliable Ensembl [7] database using any phylogenetic pattern.

Construction & content
We generated a set of phylogenetic lineages containing all
of the genes in Ensembl [7] that have orthologs in other
species according to the EnsMart [8] database. This set
covers all of the 21 (eukaryotic) species available in EnsMart version 40 (pre-versions and low coverage genomes
not taken into account). We collected the complete set of
orthologies between these species: 420 species pairs,
446,825 genes and 3,164,088 orthologous relationships.
These orthologies consist of 2,000,706 one-to-one,
795,723 one-to-many and 367,659 many-to-many relationships, created by the very extensive orthology prediction pipeline [9] from Ensembl. This pipeline starts with
the collection of a number of Best Reciprocal Hits (BRH,
proven to be accurate [10]) and Best Score Ratio (BSR) values from a WUBlastp/Smith-Waterman whole-genome
comparison. These are used to create a graph of gene relations, followed by a clustering step. These clusters are then
applied to build a multiple alignment using MUSCLE [11]
and a phylogenetic tree using PHYML [12]. Finally, the
gene tree is reconciled with the species tree using RAP [5].
From each reconciled gene tree, the above mentioned
orthologous relationships are inferred. After the collection
of all orthologous pairs, we generated phylogenetic lineages using a single linkage algorithm. First, we determined
the evolutionary order of the studied species using the
NCBI Taxonomy [13] database. The phylogenetic tree of
these species, together with some phylogenetic branch
names, can be seen in Figure 1. Second, we used this phylogenetic tree as a starting point for building our phylogenetic lineages. For each gene in the first species (S.
cerevisiae), we looked for orthologs in the other 20 species.
All orthologs were added to the phylogenetic lineage, and
in the next round were checked for orthologs themselves,
until no more orthologies were found for any of the genes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/398

This process was repeated for all genes in all 21 species
that were not yet connected to any phylogenetic lineage
yet. The complete phylogenetic lineage determination
generated 147,922 lineages. Please note that the phylogenetic order that we have determined here does not affect
the construction of the phylogenetic lineages in any way:
changing the order only influences the numbering of the
phylogenetic lineages but not the contents of the lineages.
This is due to our clustering method, in which each
orthologous relationship is treated symmetrically. Figure
2 shows the database scheme: the phylogenetic lineages
and some extra information have been stored in four
tables, optimized for fast querying.

Utility & discussion
Utility
We developed an intuitive web interface (Figure 3) named
PhyloPat to query a MySQL database containing these
phylogenetic lineages and derived phylogenetic patterns.
As input a phylogenetic pattern is used, generated by clicking a set of radio buttons or by typing a regular expression,
or a list of Ensembl or EMBL identifiers. The application
of MySQL regular expressions provides enhanced querying. The output can be given in HTML, Excel or plain text
format. A link to the FatiGO web interface has been incorporated in the HTML output, creating easy access to functional information. Each phylogenetic lineage can be
viewed separately by clicking the PhyloPat ID (PPID).
This view gives all Ensembl IDs within the phylogenetic
lineage plus the HUGO [14] gene names. The web interface also provides some example queries, the 100 most
occurring patterns, and numerical overviews of lineages
that are present in 1) all species 2) almost all species and
3) only one or two species. Finally, a phylogenetic tree of
all included species is provided, through which each
branch can be selected to view a list of branch-specific
genes. This tree can be downloaded in PHYLIP [15] format.
Omnipresent genes
An analysis of all lineages with the phylogenetic pattern
'111111111111111111111' (or MySQL regular expression '^1+$') gives a list of 'omnipresent' genes, i.e. present
in all 21 species. We found 1001 omnipresent genes,
which are most likely involved in important functions,
since they are present in all species. Figure 4 shows the GO
annotation [16] for all 2185 human genes within these
omnipresent phylogenetic lineages, generated by FatiGO
[17]. When human genes are present in the output,
FatiGO can be queried by clicking a button below the output. To compare the results, we also show the GO annotation for the complete set of human genes (31,718 in
Ensembl v40). Lines are drawn between similar GO classifications, to facilitate easy comparison between the
omnipresent genes and all human genes. It is clear from

nigroviridis and T. rubripes (1572 oligopresent genes) and
A. gambiae and A. Aegypti (1058 oligopresent genes).
These results correspond perfectly with the current opinion on evolutionary relationships. It should also be noted
that the number of genes present in only one species is
this high because of the incomplete orthology information contained in the EnsMart database. This will improve
with each new Ensembl release, as orthology information
and functional annotation are expanded in each release.

the 6th level GO biological process annotation (Figure 4a)
that omnipresent genes are less often involved in transcription compared to a human gene chosen at random,
but more often in cellular protein metabolism and establishment of cellular localization. We suggest that the process of transcription does not need that many genes in the
'lower' species, but in the 'higher' species, like human,
many transcription related gene families have expanded
([18], table 1). Analysis of the 6th level GO molecular
functions (Figure 4b) shows that many omnipresent
genes have ATP binding or pyrophosphatase activity,
while the human gene set consists for almost 10% of
genes with rhodopsin-like receptor activity. The latter is
due to the fact that the GPCR class A family has expanded
greatly in mammals ([19], table 2). Finally, the 6th level
GO cellular components (Figure 4c) show that a lesser
fraction of the omnipresent genes are integral to the
plasma membrane.
Oligopresent genes
The distribution of 'oligopresent' genes (genes that exist in
only one/two species) can be used to determine which
species are evolutionary most related, as the number of
shared genes, that are absent in other species, can be used
as a measure for the phylogenetic distance [20]. It is
apparent that are the closest relatives are C. savignyi and C.
intestinalis (1737 oligopresent genes), followed by T.

Polypresent genes
A second measure for evolutionary relatedness is the distribution of 'polypresent' genes: genes that are missing in
only one or two species. S. cerevisiae has the highest
number of missing polypresent genes: 961 polypresent
genes do not occur in S. cerevisiae only, and 854 polypresent genes are not present in S. cerevisiae and a second species. Other high-scoring pairs include both Ciona species
(47 absent polypresent genes) and the combination of
one of these Ciona species with G. gallus (16 and 14 absent
polypresent genes). The relatively high number for the latter pair is striking, because these species are not closely
related. One would suspect such a high number only for
two species that are relatively closely related, which is the
case for the two Ciona species.
Case study: Hox genes
As a case study we used the highly researched and from an
evolutionary point-of-view very interesting Hox genes.
First, we searched the Ensembl database for human genes
with the term 'hox' in the annotation. We found 44 genes,
which were entered into PhyloPat. The output is shown in
Table 1. The lists of Ensembl IDs have been replaced by
the number of IDs. 32 phylogenetic lineages were found,
one of which were already present in C. elegans:
PP022041. This lineage contains the Msh homeobox-like
proteins. PP024984 and PP027791, containing the
HOXC4 and TLX lineages, are only found in the Coelomata: A. gambiae and further. No less than 22 lineages
originated in the early vertebrates, presented by T. nigroviridis. HOXD12 and HOXB13 are only present in mammals.

Striking observations can be made with the fish species:
all three species have significantly more Hox genes than
the mammals. T. nigroviridis, for example, has 57 genes in
this lineage, while M. domestica has only 35. These numbers correspond well with the fact that Teleost fish have at
least seven Hox clusters, whereas mammals have only
four [21]. Mammals also have less Hox genes per cluster,
demonstrating that there has been gene loss within the
Hox clusters since the evolution from a vertebrate ancestor to present-day mammals [22]. Table 2 shows the further analysis of the Hox genes using the PhyloPat output.
H. sapiens misses the genes HOXA8, HOXB10, HOXB11,

HOXC1, HOXC2, HOXC3, HOXC7, HOXD2, HOXD5,

agreement with current knowledge of human Hox genes
(figure 3A of [22]). Two exceptions exist: HOXC8 instead
of HOXC7, and the absence of HOXA12. The HOXA12
gene cannot be found in the other mammals either.

The web interface has the menu on the left and the input/
results page on the right. On the pattern search page, the
user can generate a phylogenetic pattern by clicking a radio
button for each species. 1 = present, * = present/absent, 0 =
absent. The buttons directly below put all 21 species on the
corresponding mode. MySQL regular expressions offer the
possibility of advanced querying. The user can choose to
show any number of lineages and choose the output format:
HTML, Excel or plain text.

Functional annotation
PhyloPat can be used for annotation of genes with
unknown functions. When a gene with unknown function is clustered in a certain phylogenetic lineage, the
function of other genes in that lineage can be assigned to
the gene with unknown function. For example, the
PP001723 lineage [23] contains a number of genes that
have an unknown function, under which the
ENSANGG00000008970 gene from A. gambiae and the
ENSCING00000000880 gene from C. intestinalis. By using
the orthology information provided by Ensembl and the
PhyloPat clustering into one lineage, we can see that all of
these genes are connected to the human gene KLHDC4.
This function can now be assigned to the genes with
unknown function.

Discussion
The above examples show that PhyloPat is useful in evolutionary studies and gene annotation. It continues on the
concept of phylogenetic pattern tools like EPPS [2], and
on gene databases like TreeFam [6] and Homogen [5]. The
originality of PhyloPat lies in the combination of these
two aspects: phylogenetic pattern querying and gene family databases. In PhyloPat it is possible to determine a species set that should be included (1), a species set that
should be excluded (0) and a species set which presence is
indifferent (*). This, and the use of regular expression
queries, enables quite complicate phylogenetic patterns
searches and clustering. For example, with PhyloPat it is
quite easy to find two sets of genes that have completely
anti-correlating
patterns
(like
'001111100011000000000'
and
'110000011100111111111'). Some of these genes from
the different sets might turn out to be analogous, i.e. performing the same function but having different ancestor
genes. Such kind of analysis is very hard to do with Tree-

Fam or Hogenom. Furthermore, we aim to provide an
easy-to-use web interface in which the Ensembl database
can be queried using phylogenetic patterns. In just one
second, users can see which gene families are present in a
certain species set but missing in another species set. The
output of our application can be easily analyzed by the
FatiGO tool, like we demonstrated in figure 4. Finally,
PhyloPat has the advantage of only relying on the
Ensembl database. Treefam and Hogenom use a wide
range of gene and protein databases, each with their own
standards and methodologies. By using only the Ensembl
database (considered by many to be the standard genome
database) as input, we create a non-redundant database,
through which it is possible to easily study lineage-specific
expansions of gene families.

Conclusion
The analyses of the oligopresent, polypresent and omnipresent genes, as well as the small case study of the Hox
genes, are just a few examples of what can be done with

phylogenetic patterns in general and PhyloPat in particular. Using this tool, it is easy to find genes that e.g. occur
for the first time in vertebrates, occur only in a specific
number of species, or are unique for a certain species. It
will be of help in the annotation of genes with unknown
functions. By comparing the genes in lineages with anticorrelating patterns, it will also help finding analogous
genes. PhyloPat will be completely recalculated with each
major Ensembl release to ensure up-to-date and reliable
phylogenetic lineages.
