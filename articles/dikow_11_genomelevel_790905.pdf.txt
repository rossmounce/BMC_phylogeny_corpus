Genome-level homology and phylogeny of
Shewanella (Gammaproteobacteria:
lteromonadales: Shewanellaceae)
Rebecca B Dikow1,2

Abstract
Background: The explosion in availability of whole genome data provides the opportunity to build phylogenetic
hypotheses based on these data as well as the ability to learn more about the genomes themselves. The biological
history of genes and genomes can be investigated based on the taxomonic history provided by the phylogeny. A
phylogenetic hypothesis based on complete genome data is presented for the genus Shewanella
(Gammaproteobacteria: Alteromonadales: Shewanellaceae). Nineteen taxa from Shewanella (16 species and 3
additional strains of one species) as well as three outgroup species representing the genera Aeromonas
(Gammaproteobacteria: Aeromonadales: Aeromonadaceae), Alteromonas (Gammaproteobacteria: Alteromonadales:
Alteromonadaceae) and Colwellia (Gammaproteobacteria: Alteromonadales: Colwelliaceae) are included for a total
of 22 taxa.
Results: Putatively homologous regions were found across unannotated genomes and tested with a phylogenetic
analysis. Two genome-wide data-sets are considered, one including only those genomic regions for which all taxa
are represented, which included 3,361,015 aligned nucleotide base-pairs (bp) and a second that additionally
includes those regions present in only subsets of taxa, which totaled 12,456,624 aligned bp. Alignment columns in
these large data-sets were then randomly sampled to create smaller data-sets. After the phylogenetic hypothesis
was generated, genome annotations were projected onto the DNA sequence alignment to compare the historical
hypothesis generated by the phylogeny with the functional hypothesis posited by annotation.
Conclusions: Individual phylogenetic analyses of the 243 locally co-linear genome regions all failed to recover the
genome topology, but the smaller data-sets that were random samplings of the large concatenated alignments all
produced the genome topology. It is shown that there is not a single orthologous copy of 16S rRNA across the
taxon sampling included in this study and that the relationships among the multiple copies are consistent with
16S rRNA undergoing concerted evolution. Unannotated whole genome data can provide excellent raw material
for generating hypotheses of historical homology, which can be tested with phylogenetic analysis and compared
with hypotheses of gene function.

Background
Shewanella is a genus of marine and freshwater gramnegative Gammaproteobacteria within the monogeneric
family Shewanellaceae Ivanova et al., 2004. While members of Shewanella have been recognized since 1931 (e.
g. Achromobacter putrefaciens Derby and Hammer 1931
now Shewanella putrefaciens), the genus Shewanella has

only been recognized with its present name since 1985
[1] and 39 of the 52 currently recognized species have
been described since 2000 [2]. There are also multiple
strains that are commonly studied but have not been
given a proper name (some of these have been included
below and will be referred to by their strain number).
Members of Shewanella have been described from
diverse habitats, including deep cold-water marine environments to shallow Antarctic Ocean habitats to hydrothermal vents and freshwater lakes (see Table 1[1,3-21]).
Shewanella has been of great interest due to the ability

of its species to convert heavy metals and toxic substances (e.g. iron, sulfur, uranium) into less toxic products by using them as electron acceptors in certain
respiratory situations, making them of interest for environmental clean-up (e.g. iron, sulfur: [22]; uranium: [23]).
To this end, 19 genomes have been fully sequenced and
deposited on GenBank as of 2009. Annotations suggest
that species possess approximately 5,000 genes and have
genomes of approximately 5 Mbp (details in Table 1).
The goal of the study presented here is to investigate
how we can use whole genome data, not only to build a
tree but to inform us of gene and genome history by

comparing the hypothesis of historical homology supported by the phylogenetic hypothesis to what is known
about gene function. There is a computational interest
in the ability to build large trees, both in number of
taxa and number of characters, e.g. [24,25]. The biological history of genes and genomes can be investigated
based on the taxomonic history of the bearers of these
characters. This goes further than just the prediction of
function of uncharacterized genes, but also includes the
potential to track changing function over gene history
and finding up- or down-stream segments of co-evolving DNA. Eisen and Fraser highlighted many of these

Dikow BMC Genomics 2011, 12:237
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/237

goals when they introduced the term “phylogenomics”
[26]. While these goals are broad and ambitious, it is
the hope that the present study represents a step in this
direction.
The presented approach also represents a shift for
phylogenetic systematics, in which historically one has
generally known all the characters of interest very well
and perhaps had a well-formed opinion about their history based on a lifetime of knowledge about their distribution and subtle variations. Even with molecular
characters in the form of one or a few genes, even with
many taxa, one gets to know the ‘reliable’ parts of an
alignment and often memorizes the DNA sequence after
having sequenced and edited the same marker for several years. The approach presented here proposes a new
perspective which is obligated by the new kinds of data
being gathered, particularly those from next-generation
and shotgun sequencing, which generate millions of
nucleotide base-pairs (bp) as opposed to thousands. Primary homology (sensu dePinna, [27]) must be determined in an automated fashion given the vast amount
of data and the few character states of nucleotide data.
The phylogenetic tree becomes an intermediate point it is built based on hypotheses of primary homology,
which it tests, and then is used as a framework for optimizing the character states and looking back to functional gene annotations to begin to answer questions
about gene and genome history. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers can provide hypotheses of primary
homology, as amplifications using primers target conserved flanking regions, which provide a sufficient level
of confidence that the ‘same’ regions are being
sequenced. With next-generation sequencing, we have
no such sense of location (particularly with bacteria), as
we expect rearrangement of genes or other genomic
segments over evolutionary history [28-31]. Annotations
can provide information about the function of genes
and the location of open reading frames, but these may
not lead us to historical homology and will miss much
of the homology present in the genome, for example
among genes of altered function or non-coding DNA.
A second goal of this study is to present an example
of comparative genomics for a closely related taxon that
is densely sampled. This helps to avoid some of the
downsides of comparative genomics when few, disparate
taxa are compared: leaps of faith with character homology and trivial phylogenetic topologies. Finally, as an
attempt to begin the investigation of gene history, 16S
rRNA is presented as a test case. 16S rRNA was chosen
because it is the marker that has defined prokaryote taxonomy for the past 30 years [32]. While it is not used
without some skepticism, e.g. [33,34], the way that primary homology is generated here provides an opportunity to test our assumptions about 16S rRNA. This

manuscript will address the outlined points in the following sections: Mauve primary homology [35], genome
trees, subset trees, and 16S rRNA investigation.

Methods
For all taxa of Shewanella for which the genome
sequence has been completed and deposited on GenBank, 16 species and 3 additional strains of one species
and for three outgroup taxa, unannotated genome
sequences were downloaded (strain and accession numbers in Table 1). Seven gene loci were also downloaded
individually for all 22 taxa from the same genome accession numbers. The genes are gyrB (DNA gyrase subunit
B), rpoA (DNA directed RNA polymerase subunit
alpha), recA (recombinase A), topA (DNA topoisomerase
I), mreB (rod shape-determining protein), gapA (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and atpA (ATP
synthase F1 subunit alpha). Those species for which
only one strain is included will hereafter be referred to
by only their species name. For Shewanella baltica, for
which multiple strains have been sampled, I will refer to
the strain numbers throughout. Annotations were also
downloaded from RefSeq (GenBank’s Reference
Sequence Collection, 2009). The sampled genomes
range in size from 4,306,142 nucleotide base-pairs (bp)
and 3,785 genes (Shewanella amazonensis) to 5,935,403
bp and 5,096 genes (Shewanella woodyi). All of the
below analyses were performed on a 2.8 GHz QuadCore MacPro with 20 GB RAM.
Mauve primary homology

Sequences were submitted to a genome alignment using
Progressive Mauve [35]. This program has been used
previously on fairly closely related members of Gammaproteobacteria [36]. Traditional multiple sequence alignment cannot be used on complete genome sequences
because significant rearrangement of genes or fragments
has been shown to occur over evolutionary history
[28-31]. Mauve addresses this issue by finding locally
collinear blocks (LCBs), or contiguous segments of
sequence within which there has not been rearrangement, but within a longer sequence that may have been
subject to rearrangement events. The default parameters
in Mauve were used. Mauve finds anchor points of similarity and then extends these matches outward. A single
LCB becomes two when a sequence segment is found
somewhere else in the genome for one of the taxa,
meaning that a rearrangement has occurred. Mauve
does not allow one sequence fragment to be homologous to more than one fragment in another species.
CGView [37] has been used to plot the genomic location of LCBs found common to all species and to project gene annotations onto LCB alignments. Resulting
LCBs were submitted to standard multiple sequence

alignment with MAFFT [38]. Mauve output XMFA files
include the base-pair ranges (e.g. bp 1-10,000) of each
LCB for each taxon. The base-pair locations were used
along with annotations to assess which genes were present in each LCB. At the suggestion of a reviewer,
Mauve was also run with a single outgroup taxon, C.
psychrerythraea, to compare the influence of one vs.
more than one outgroup on the percent of the genome
covered by the Mauve alignment.
Genome trees

Aligned LCBs were concatenated and submitted for phylogenetic analysis with parsimony in TNT [39], maximum likelihood in RaxML v. 7.0.4 [40], and Neighbor
Joining [41] in Geneious Pro 4.8.3 [42]. Long alignments
are challenging for phylogenetic tree building programs
as many of these programs have a limit on the number
of input characters or cannot access enough RAM to
read the alignment. Those programs mentioned above
were able to read the data analyzed here. The TNT
commands consisted of 1000 builds with SPR and TBR
followed by 1500 replicates of ratchet and tree fusing
[43,44]. RaxML was run under the GTRGAMMA model
of nucleotide substitution. Only a single bootstrap replicate was attempted at a time, as this seemed to be the
computational limit, at least for the used workstation, as
any additional searching caused an error. Neighbor Joining was run with Jukes-Cantor, Tamura-Nei, and HKY
genetic distance models in three separate analyses. Bootstrap resampling was attempted in TNT, with 5,000
pseudoreplicates. As an additional measure of support,
trees were built from individual LCBs and were used to
score whether nodes in the genome tree were also present in the individual LCB trees. Gaps were initially
treated as a fifth state in TNT but all genome-wide
data-sets were also reanalyzed with gaps treated as missing data. When not specified, the TNT analyses refer to
those in which gaps were treated as a fifth state.
Subset trees

In order to compare the phylogenetic signal from the
entire genome to signals from subsets of the genome,
three courses of action were taken. The first asks the
question whether localized signal is congruent with
whole genome signal. To this end, phylogenetic hypotheses were built for individual LCBs, as above, in TNT.
Second, in order to address whether the number of
characters has a direct result on the topology, scripts
using BioPerl were used to randomly sub-sample the
nucleotide alignment and produce data-sets of varying
size, 20,000 bp, 100,000 bp, 500,000 bp and 1,000,000
bp, which were submitted to the same phylogenetic
treatment as above. Finally, a seven-gene analysis was
attempted in TNT, as above, to compare a traditional

Page 4 of 14

phylogenetic analysis to the genome-level analysis that
was the main goal of the study.
16S rRNA investigation

16S rRNA copies were tracked throughout the Mauve
LCBs in order to establish for which of the 16S rRNA
copies Mauve made an hypothesis of homology. All
copies of 16S rRNA for all taxa (taxa have 8-11 copies
each, according to annotations, for a total of 200 terminal branches for the 22 taxa), whether or not present in
an LCB, were extracted from their respective annotated
genome files, aligned with MAFFT, and submitted for
phylogenetic analysis in TNT and RaxML, as above.

Results
Mauve primary homology

Mauve results are summarized in Table 1. Figure 1 is a
CGView plot, which shows the genomic locations of
those LCBs present for all taxa. Each circle represents a
taxon (genome) and the colored blocks represent the
individual LCBs. Blocks of the same color are putatively
homologous LCBs. White space represents the parts of
the genome within which Mauve did not find homology
among all taxa sampled. Mauve ran for approximately 7
days and 243 LCBs were found common to all taxa. The
length of individual LCBs after DNA sequence alignment ranged from 645 bp to 129,020 bp and the number of genes per LCB ranged from zero to 30 and the
mean was 6.07 genes per LCB for S. woodyi, for example. When added together, these 243 all-taxa LCBs
represented a range from 23.7 to 34.3% of the genomes
and 1096 and 1559 genes (as per annotations from
RefSeq) along with non-coding DNA (Table 1). For S.
sp. MR-7, for example, there are 218,403 non-coding
nucleotide base-pairs included, 14.8% of the unaligned
nucleotide base-pairs. The concatenated alignment was
3,361,015 bp (hereafter referred to as the 3 Mbp alignment). The sequence identity of the alignment is 48.7%.
If we also consider those LCBs shared among subsets of
taxa (at least 2) that contained >100 bp, there were
3004 LCBs, which represented 36.4 to 97.1% of the genomes (Table 1). The concatenated alignment of these
3004 LCBs was 12,456,624 bp (hereafter referred to as
the 12 Mbp alignment). When the only outgroup taxon
considered is C. psychrerythraea, there were 325 LCBs
and the concatenated alignment was 4,604,291 bp. C.
psychrerythraea had 1,690,088 unaligned bp present in
the Mauve alignment when it was the only outgroup, as
compared to 1,272,052, when the other two outgroups
were also included.

trees have the same topology (shown in Figure 2 - hereafter referred to as the ‘genome tree’), while the NJ tree
does not (Figure 3A). The only reason NJ was attempted
was to investigate the idea that when there are so many
data, phylogenetic hypotheses might converge on those
constructed from similarity only. In this case, the topologies are not the same. All three NJ genetic distance
models produced the same topology. The TNT tree for

the 3 Mbp alignment had 7,875,803 steps. Multiple individual RaxML runs all produced the same topology. The
likelihood score was -860351.367382. The 12 Mbp alignment and 3 Mbp alignment gave the same topology in
TNT, which is not unexpected given that the 3 Mbp
alignment is just a subset of the 12 Mbp alignment. The
12 Mbp alignment produced a tree of 29,512,322 steps
in TNT but a tree was not found in RaxML; the

program terminated with an error. The NJ trees for the
12 Mbp alignment had the same topology as the NJ
trees for the 3 Mbp alignment (Figure 3A). When gaps
are treated as missing data for the 3 Mbp alignment in
TNT (Figure 3C), S. amazonensis and S. loihica are no
longer sister, and the placement of S. denitrificans + S.
frigidimarina is much more derived. This tree had
4,274,327 steps. Shewanella formed a monophyletic
group in every case, however. Bootstrap values from

TNT are not shown for the genome tree, as they are
100% for every node. Above the branches in Figure 2 is

(from the 3 Mbp alignment) that contain that particular

C. psychrerythraea is the only outgroup taxon included
is shown in Figure 3D. The most parsimonious tree had
a length of 10,573,382 when gaps are treated as a fifth
state. The same topology resulted when gaps were

Subset trees

On the trees built from the 243 individual LCBs in
TNT, for which there were 286 most parsimonious trees
(MPTs), none had the topology of the genome tree with
gaps as fifth state. There are 285 unique topologies
represented in these 286 trees. None of these 286 trees
has the topology of the gaps as missing TNT analysis
either. While the individual LCB trees cannot be
referred to as gene trees per se, as the vast majority of
LCBs contain more than one gene as well as non-coding
DNA, the phenomenon of parts of a data-set not producing the same phylogenetic signal, is comparable. To
address whether it was an issue of number of base-pairs
versus different localized signals concentrated in different contiguous parts of the genome (i.e. each LCB), I
used the data-sets generated with BioPerl scripts, that
randomly selected nucleotide columns from the 3 Mbp
alignment and separately for the 12 Mbp alignment.
These data-sets consisted of 20,000 bp, 100,000 bp,
500,000 bp and 1,000,000 bp for each of the original
alignments. When I performed phylogenetic analyses on
these data-sets, all produced the same topology as the
phylogenetic (TNT and RaxML) genome tree; the same
topology that was not found for any of the 243 singleLCB data-sets. For the seven-gene dataset, genes were
aligned separately in MAFFT and then concatenated,
resulting in an alignment of 13,009 bp. The topology
resulting from this analysis is shown in Figure 3B with
bootstrap resampling frequencies shown below the
branches.
16S rRNA investigation

The next step was to associate the annotation, or list of
open reading frames (ORFs) and their locations, with
the list of LCB boundaries for each species. Of initial
interest was tracking the multiple copies of 16S rRNA
within these taxa and assessing their presence within the
LCBs. There were 13 LCBs that contained a copy of 16S
rRNA for at least one species. These are shown in the
grid next to the tree in Figure 2. The LCBs are 4 (S. sp.
MR-7, S. sp. MR-4, S. sp. ANA-3), 7 (S. halifaxensis, S.
pealeana), 19 (S. putrefaciens), 27 (A. hydrophila), 37 (S.
baltica OS195), 58 (C. psychrerythraea), 60 (A. hydrophila), 79 (S. amazonensis, S. loihica, S. baltica OS155,
S. baltica OS223, S. baltica OS 185, S. baltica OS195, S.
sp. W3-18-1, S. sp. MR-7, S. sp. MR-4, S. sp. ANA-3, S.
oneidensis, S. sediminis, S. woodyi), 142 (C. psychrerythraea), 197 (A. hydrophila), 219 (S. baltica OS185, S.
baltica OS195), 222 (S. frigidimarina, S. denitrificans, S.

ANA-3). The first obvious pattern is that, while all
copies of 16S rRNA are homologous (derived from a
single 16S rRNA ancestral copy), there was no single
copy of 16S rRNA aligned by Mauve across all taxa,
which would indicate the possibility of orthology. When
the LCBs present in subsets of taxa were considered,
and the subset of interest is all Shewanella species, there
was also no single 16S rRNA copy aligned across all
Shewanella taxa. It must also be noted that it is possible
that there is a single orthologous copy that Mauve is
unable to recover.
When all 16S rRNA copies were extracted from annotated genomes and subjected to multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis, for a number of species,
two 16S rRNA copies within a particular taxon were
identical, but there were never any copies identical
among different species. For S. baltica strains, however,
there were instances where one strain had a copy identical to a copy in another strain. The results of the phylogenetic analysis of all copies of 16S rRNA were, from
TNT, a MPT with 1275 steps (Figure 4). Out of the
1584 characters, 338 were parsimony informative. Topological differences between the TNT tree and that produced by RaxML will be addressed in the discussion.

Discussion
Mauve primary homology

The approach Mauve takes to assigning primary homology does not take function, gene boundaries, or ORFs
into account a priori. Mauve allows each sequence fragment to be homologous to only one other fragment.
Also, when we consider only the LCBs present in all
taxa, we avoid fragments that might be recently laterally
transferred, because these would not be present in all
taxa. Since Mauve does not consider annotation a priori,
one can compare the Mauve alignment to annotation
without following circular reasoning to ascertain which
genes are aligned to one another (putative gene homologies). Questions or hypotheses about probable function
for unknown genes and history of regions of conflicting
function can now be studied. Figure 5 illustrates this
approach. For LCB 27, which consists of 13,022 aligned
nucleotide base-pairs, the gene annotations have been
projected onto the alignment. What is obvious from this
plot is that in general, the gene boundaries match up
well and the gene content of LCB 27 is fairly consistent
across the taxa sampled. But there are areas of interest,
for example rpmD (or 50S ribosomal protein L30) is
present in most taxa, but absent in S. sediminis, filled

instead by non-coding DNA. This pattern is consistent
with multiple possible explanations, including (1) poor
annotation, (2) sequencing error, (3) this gene has
become inactivated or degraded significantly enough
that it is not recognized by annotation, or (4) this gene
has really been deleted from the genome. Furthermore,
the length variation in particular genes is put into context and we can see perhaps from what kind of material
(non-coding or gene) they have been transformed. The
length variation might not only indicate de novo insertions of material, but conversion from a neighboring
gene. This possibility is illustrated in rpsE and rpmD,
where rpmD spills into rpsE for two S. baltica strains
(Figure 5).
The allowance for variation within an LCB for basepair length and number of genes among different taxa is
how the estimates of primary homology considered by
Mauve differ from previous studies: they do not require
that a gene, which might look functionally the same, be
homologous (aligned) across all taxa simply because it is
present in these taxa. This is key in our beginning to
understand gene histories and how these histories interact with the functional roles of genes. The homologies
among fragments of non-coding DNA are also important, because if these kinds of analyses are extended to
eukaryotes, which have vastly more non-coding DNA,
we will be looking for ways to include these data and
not be limited to evidence of history only from genes,
which might have conflicting histories.
As can be seen in Table 1 in the all-taxa LCB dataset, the coverage by LCBs among included taxa ranges
between 23-34%. In the subset taxa LCB data-set, one
can track the coverage by phylogenetic position, with
the innermost nodes having the most complete coverage. This coverage (Subset taxa LCBs) ranges from 3697%. Outgroup taxa have a lower percentage of their
genome covered by LCBs than do ingroup taxa. This
pattern would be expected if the outgroups are indeed
more distant relatives than any of the ingroup taxa. The
inclusion of outgroups in a Mauve analysis decreases
the LCB coverage, because they are more distantly
related, but is essential to polarizing the characters
obtaining the optimal phylogenetic topology. The reason
three outgroup taxa were included was because there
had not been a previous study showing that Alteromonas and Colwellia were indeed basal to Shewanella.
One could not assume that Shewanella was monophyletic a priori; the seven-gene analysis (Figure 3B) finds a
non-monophyletic Shewanella. To address a reviewer
comment that using a single outgroup would increase
the amount of data considered in the phylogenetic

analysis, however, another Mauve run was attempted
with a single outgroup (C. psychrerythraea). This species
was chosen because it was found to be the most closely
related to Shewanella, and therefore would cause the
greatest increase in data if the other outgroups were
not included. If just the most basal outgroup was

included, one would not expect much of a change in
genome coverage. The initial analysis, in which all three
outgroup taxa are included, allows one to make the
most a posteriori claims about homology for the broadest range of taxa. The topological differences are discussed below.

Genome trees

The number of parsimony informative characters in the
3 Mbp alignment (26.48%) was within the range of
many molecular studies based on one or a few genes, e.
g. [45,46]. This fact provides a sense of confidence that
Mauve was finding real, or at least likely, homologies.
This percentage ranged from 1.4% to 53.6% when LCBs
were compared to each other. If the percentage of parsimony informative characters had been significantly
higher, I might be concerned that non-homologous and
non-similar sequences were being aligned. In the
RaxML analysis, gaps were treated as missing. Gaps
were treated as a fifth state as the default for the parsimony (TNT) analyses because gaps do represent evolutionary events. The nature of the Mauve analysis, in my
opinion, lends itself to the treatment of gaps as fifthstate characters because Mauve either breaks up a single
LCB into two or more if homologous fragments are
found in different positions in one or more genomes. If
Mauve has postulated one LCB instead of two, it is then
assumed that gaps represent the lack of homologous
DNA sequence, not missing data. As for statistical support, values of 100% on all nodes are not particularly
telling. By scoring the individual LCB trees for nodes
present in the genome tree, it is clearer which nodes are
the most and least robust. The relationships among
strains of S. baltica have low support (60/286 trees), as
might be expected if these have either recently diverged,
or are exchanging genes. Confidence in the topology is
also supported by the results of the random data-set
analyses, which amount to a jackknife technique (without replacement).
When gaps are treated as missing data, as well as
when C. psychrerythraea is the only outgroup taxon
considered, there are topological differences in the placement of S. amazonensis, S. loihica, S. denitrificans,
and S. frigidimarina, although S. denitrificans and S. frigidimarina are always sister. The remaining taxa retain
their relationships. The node that separates S. denitrificans, S. frigidimarina, S. amazonensis, and S. loihica
from the remaining species of Shewanella is the least
well supported node in the tree, with 34 out of 286 individual LCB trees containing that node, indicating that it
is not surprising that these four taxa are the ones that
are placed differently in the various permutations of
genome-wide data-sets. It is interesting that the RaxML
tree and the gaps as fifth-state TNT tree have the same
topology. There are multiple possible explanations for
this finding. A reviewer mentioned that if genes are lost
or gained in a single step, that considering gaps individually dramatically over-emphasizes the number of evolutionary events. It is also important to note, however,
that by treating gaps as missing, one is ignoring those
evolutionary events completely. It could be that a

Page 11 of 14

significant proportion of the evidence is lost in the gaps
as missing analyses, but that maximum likelihood is better at compensating for multiple hits. To address the
possibility that gaps, representing insertion/deletion
(indel) events are overwhelming the phylogenetic signal,
the number of parsimony tree steps resulting from indel
events at internal nodes has been calculated to be
814,304. This number is 23.6% of all indels (the rest
being at the terminal branches, autapomorphies that
provide no information on branching pattern in parsimony) and 10.3% of total tree length. These calculations
show that information from gaps does not make up a
dominant proportion of the phylogenetic signal. It is
entirely possible that the lack of indel data in the parsimony-missing data analyses leads to a different answer,
but the presence of indel data in the gaps as fifth-state
analysis and the ability of maximum likelihood to
account for saturation give the same tree. This just
argues for evidence that the genome tree (RaxML, parsimony gaps as fifth state) is the optimal tree.
For 22 taxa, there are 1.31 × 10^25 possible rooted
bifurcating trees [47]. It is surprising, then, that there
was an immediate convergence on the optimal topology
for the 12 Mbp, 3 Mbp, and random data-sets when run
in TNT. Wagner tree build plus TBR branch swapping
found the optimal tree very rapidly, within a minute. No
amount of ratcheting or tree fusing altered the topology
or tree length. The decisiveness of these data [48] marks
the difference between analyses consisting of one or a
few genes and the present analysis. Just as the idea of
support needs to be adjusted to accommodate whole
genome analyses, so do our expectations of tree search.
A recent paper considering the systems biology of
Shewanella based on the whole genome sequences of 10
taxa (a subset of those included here) produced a phylogeny for those 10 taxa based on 1507 single-copy orthologs identified through a combination of, “(i) proteinprotein pairwise reciprocal BLAST (blastp); (ii) reciprocal protein genomic sequence best match (tblastn); and
(iii) Darwin pairwise best hit” ([49], p. 15914). Their tree
had the same topological relationships for those 10 taxa
as the genome tree presented here. It is also interesting
that the number of genes found to be single-copy orthologs in [49] is comparable to the number of genes present in the LCBs for the ingroup taxa presented here
(Table 1). Future work might ask whether the sets of
orthologs are similar for these two data-sets and how
these two different approaches (ortholog identification
vs. unannotated homology detection) might complement
each other to best utilize whole genome sequence data.
Subset trees

It is interesting that none of the trees that resulted from
analysis of each LCB separately produced the same

Dikow BMC Genomics 2011, 12:237
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/237

topology as the genome tree, even though there are relatively few taxa, and that the randomly sampled data-sets
all produced the genome-tree topology, even though
some of the LCBs were longer than some of the randomly sampled data-sets. Sometimes Shewanella was
not monophyletic in individual LCB trees. What the
results highlight, is that with a genome approach, which
does not only focus on particular genes of interest, one
is able to discern a unique phylogenetic signal. The random data-set tree results demonstrate that localized
LCB signal might be a factor, even when an LCB contains 25 or more genes. One might expect that sampling
nucleotides across all LCBs produces a signal closer to
the optimum than does focusing on parts of the genome
with putatively different histories. The surprising insight
here was that 20,000 bp was enough to see this effect,
for the present taxon sampling. It should also be noted
that Mauve provides a kind of filter, in that the LCBs
consist of those parts of the genome that have passed
tests of similarity and co-linearity. The 3 Mbp data-set,
based on LCBs common to all taxa, represents a very
complete, ideal data-set; approximately one-third of the
genome (spread over the whole genome; Figure 1) for
which all taxa have data. This is perhaps part of the reason that 20,000 bp is enough to recover the genome
tree topology, in this case. As suggested by a reviewer,
the possibility exists that 20,000 bp is simply enough for
the model mis-specification artifacts caused by mixedtree signals or incorrect substitution models to consistently yield an incorrect topology. This explanation
would require, however, that all LCBs, or all LCBs
except one also had this problem because they all produce different topologies that are not congruent with
the genome tree.
For the seven-gene tree (Figure 3B), there is generally
high bootstrap support, but there are only two ingroup
taxa that retain the same sister-group relationships that
are also present in the genome tree (Figure 2). The
genes chosen for the analysis were the same (minus 16S
rRNA) as those chosen for a phylogenetic analysis for
Vibrionaceae, the most closely related family to Shewanellaceae [46]. Even the four S. baltica strains appear
scattered across the tree. The two large clades, which
are consistent across all other trees, containing (S. woodyi, S. sediminis, S. piezotolerans, S. halifaxensis, and S.
pealeana) and (S. baltica, S. putrefaciens, S. sp. W3-181, S. sp. MR-4, S. sp. MR-7, S. sp. ANA-3, and S. oneidensis) are not present in the seven-gene tree. C. psychrerythraea, a putative outgroup taxon is nested deeply
within the ingroup in the seven-gene tree.
16S rRNA investigation

The fact that Mauve does not generate a hypothesis of
positional homology for any single copy of 16S rRNA

Page 12 of 14

even though all copies are very similar speaks to the
challenges that occur when dealing with multiple gene
copies. The pattern of gene arrangement flanking
instances of 16S rRNA is not enough to assign a
hypothesis of positional homology. There is simply too
much rearrangement to have confidence in such a
hypothesis. The taxonomic relationships suggested by
the all-copy 16S rRNA tree from TNT (Figure 4) are
different than those suggested by the genome tree (Figure 2). Nodes of congruence are highlighted in Figure 4.
There are many similarities between the all-copy 16S
rRNA tree and the genome tree, however: Shewanella is
monophyletic, S. sp. MR-7, S. sp. MR-4, S. oneidensis, S.
sp. ANA-3 are monophyletic, S. halifaxensis and S. pealeana are sister, S. denitrificans and S. frigidimarina are
sister, S. sp. W3-18-1 and S. putrefaciens form a clade, S.
piezotolerans, S. halifaxensis and S. pealeana form a
clade, S. sediminis and S. woodyi are sister, Al. macleodii
and C. psychrerythraea are sister. The 16S rRNA copy
tree from RaxML shared many nodes in common with
the 16S rRNA tree from TNT, but found the Al.
macleodii and C. psychrerythraea clade within Shewanella and did not find S. denitrificans and S. frigidimarina as sister. The fact that the TNT and RaxML trees
are not completely congruent is not particularly surprising given that there are few parsimony informative characters in 16S rRNA and that there is no expectation that
a tree-like branching pattern exist for these gene copies.
For the TNT run, the gaps were treated as a fifth state,
so that a gap can be informative. RaxML treats gaps as
missing data, so that might also account for the
differences.
Haggerty et al., [50] constructed a similar 16S rRNA
copy tree, but did so for 17 species across four genera:
Escherichia, Shigella, Yersinia, and Salmonella (also
Gammaproteobacteria). They found the backbone of
this tree, i.e. the separation of genera, conforming to
their taxonomic expectations. They did not find widespread monophyly of copies at the species level, however. The tree shown in Figure 4, based on the present
analysis, does show monophyly for many species. The
following taxa formed monophyletic groups of 16S
rRNA copies: C. psychrerythraea, Al. macleodii, S. loihica, S. woodyi, S. sediminis, S. pealeana, S. amazonensis, S. putrefaciens, S. oneidensis, S. sp. ANA-3, S.
denitrificans, S. frigidimarina. These taxa formed paraphyletic groups: S. halifaxensis (S. pealeana nested
inside), S. sp. W3-18-1 (S. putrefaciens nested inside).
The following taxa had gene copies scattered among
those of other taxa, S. sp. MR-7, S. sp. MR-4, S. baltica
OS155, S. baltica OS185, S. baltica OS195, S. baltica
OS223.
There is no expectation that this is the actual evolutionary history of these gene copies, or that it should

Dikow BMC Genomics 2011, 12:237
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/237

provide the correct relationships among taxa, because
multiple gene copies cannot all be orthologous to one
another, and are homologous only at the level that there
was one initial copy of 16S rRNA, but that is not informative at this phylogenetic level of inquiry. It was
merely an exercise to see if the copies from one species
group more closely with the other copies for that species or with copies from another species. The former is
most often the case. The notable exceptions are the S.
baltica strains, which are classified as strains of the
same species and the S. sp. MR-4 and S. sp. MR-7. S. sp.
MR-4 and MR-7 were isolated from different depths of
the Black Sea [14]. It follows that these may have been
separate lineages for a much shorter period of time than
the other taxa included in the analysis, or that there
continues to be gene exchange. The major pattern, that
of monophyly of within-species copies, might be
explained in multiple ways. Haggerty et al., 2009 suggest
that such a pattern might reflect “homogenization” of
16S rRNA copies such that each species has its own
unique suite of copies of the gene. This is also known as
concerted evolution [51]. The question remains as to
why Haggerty et al., 2009 do not recover a concerted
evolution type pattern, even though they consider taxa
not so distantly related to Shewanella and with similar
16S rRNA copy numbers. It is possible that because
they included only 17 species covering all 4 genera, their
taxon sampling was too sparse to recover the true pattern. They also removed parts of the 16S rRNA alignment that were “ambiguous”, further lowering the
number of characters, probably the informative characters, in their analysis.
Putting the issue of multiple copies aside, it is not surprising that any of the copies individually is able to
group with its species, given that 16S rRNA sequences
are a significant part of how prokaryotic species are
defined. What is more important for evolutionary studies, however, is that because there are multiple copies,
and because in the analysis presented here no one single
copy among the sampled taxa is found to be positionally
homologous, as well as the whole genome topology and
the all-copy 16S rRNA topology do not agree, 16S
rRNA should not be considered a reliable marker for
positing evolutionary relationships. Whether it performs
well diagnostically is unrelated to this question.

Conclusions
Recent phylogenetic studies have been published that
rely on many more gene loci than has been customary
in the past [e.g. 52-54]. These studies also begin to ask
and answer questions regarding the number of genes
sufficient to obtain the ‘true’ tree. Gene-tree concordance methods have also been adopted by many to this
end [55,56]. The study presented here, which takes a

Page 13 of 14

different approach, can also begin to add to this discussion. Here, it is shown that unannotated whole genome
data can provide excellent raw material for generating
hypotheses of historical homology, which can be tested
with phylogenetic analysis and compared with hypotheses of gene function. The future possibilities include
the ability to quantify lateral gene transfer and gene tree
effect, track changing function over gene history and
find segments of co-evolving DNA. It is through the
combination of methods of phylogenetic systematics and
comparative genomics that we can best use the whole
genome data to reconstruct the histories of genes, genomes, and taxa.
