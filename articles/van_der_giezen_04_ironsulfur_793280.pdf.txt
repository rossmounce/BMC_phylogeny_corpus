Abstract
Background: Iron-sulfur (FeS) proteins are present in all living organisms and play important roles
in electron transport and metalloenzyme catalysis. The maturation of FeS proteins in eukaryotes is
an essential function of mitochondria, but little is known about this process in amitochondriate
eukaryotes. Here we report on the identification and analysis of two genes encoding critical FeS
cluster (Isc) biosynthetic proteins from the amitochondriate human pathogen Entamoeba histolytica.
Results: E. histolytica IscU and IscS were found to contain all features considered essential for their
biological activity, including amino acid residues involved in substrate and/or co-factor binding. The
IscU protein differs significantly from other eukaryotic homologs and resembles the long type
isoforms encountered in some bacteria. Phylogenetic analyses of E. histolytica IscS and IscU showed
a close relationship with homologs from Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter jejuni, to the exclusion
of mitochondrial isoforms.
Conclusions: The bacterial-type FeS cluster assembly genes of E. histolytica suggest their lateral
acquisition from epsilon proteobacteria. This is a clear example of horizontal gene transfer (HGT)
from eubacteria to unicellular eukaryotic organisms, a phenomenon known to contribute
significantly to the evolution of eukaryotic genomes.

Background
After malaria, Entamoeba histolytica is the second leading
cause of death due to parasitic disease in humans [1]. E.
histolytica has been cited as infecting one tenth of the
world population, although it is now known that these
infections are caused by two very similar species, E. histolytica and E. dispar. The former is the cause of all invasive
disease, with an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 fatalities
each year [2]. This human parasite was traditionally considered a classic example of a primitive eukaryote due to
its apparent lack of `typical' eukaryotic cell structures such
as mitochondria, peroxisomes, Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum [3]. The lack of morphologically iden-

tifiable mitochondria led to the suggestion that its
ancestors predate the endosymbiotic acquisition of this
organelle [4], despite the observation that Entamoeba
branches after well established mitochondrial groups in
ribosomal RNA phylogenies [5].
The "primitively amitochondrial" view was overturned by
the discovery of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins
(e.g., chaperonin 60 (Cpn60), mitochondrial-type Hsp70
(mtHsp70), pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase
(PNT)), and by the demonstration that mitochondrial
remnant organelles (mitosomes) housing chaperonin
Cpn60 have been retained in this organism [6-9]. Several

lines of evidence support the mitochondrial ancestry of
mitosomes: i) Cpn60 and mtHsp70 cluster with mitochondrial homologs to the exclusion of prokaryotic
sequences in phylogenetic reconstructions; ii) Cpn60,
mtHsp70 and PNT contain amino terminal regions rich in
hydroxylated and positively charged amino acids, reminiscent of mitochondrial/hydrogenosomal targeting
presequences; iii) Deletion of amino acids 2–15 from the
putative targeting presequence of Cpn60 leads to an accumulation of the truncated protein in the cytosol, a phenotype that can be reversed by the addition of a functional
mitochondrial targeting signal from Trypanosoma cruzi
Hsp70 to the truncated protein [8].
Since the discovery of mitosomes in E. histolytica, mitochondrial remnant organelles have also been identified in
the microsporidian Trachipleistophora hominis [10], the
apicomplexan Cryptosporidium parvum [11] and, most
recently, in the diplomonad Giardia intestinalis [12]. Giardia mitosomes have been shown to function in FeS cluster biosynthesis and FeS protein maturation [12], essential
mitochondrial functions of eukaryotic organisms [13].
FeS proteins are involved in energy metabolism, DNA
repair, transcriptional regulation, and biosynthesis of
nucleotides and amino acids [14]. The identification of
genes encoding putative Isc proteins in the genomes of all
amitochondrial protists sequenced so far [15-19] suggests
that this mitochondrial function might have been
retained in all amitochondrial protists and may be a general functional feature of all mitochondrion-derived
organelles [12,16,20-22].
Here we report on the cloning, structural characterization
and phylogenetic analysis of E. histolytica genes encoding
Isc proteins. Both E. histolytica IscU and IscS homologs
were found to contain all the structural features required
for their biological activity, including substrate and co-factor binding sites, suggesting a fully operational FeS cluster
biosynthetic pathway in E. histolytica. Phylogenetic analyses show that both Isc proteins have a different evolutionary history to that of mitochondrial homologs, indicating
their lateral acquisition from bacteria. Moreover, the
observation that both proteins seem to have been
acquired from the same bacterial taxon might suggest a
single transfer event of a small bacterial Isc operon.

Results and Discussion
Identification and primary sequence analyses of E.
histolytica genes encoding the FeS assembly proteins IscS
and IscU
BLAST searches of preliminary data generated by the E.
histolytica genome-sequencing project revealed clones
with extensive sequence similarity to the G. intestinalis iscS
gene. PCR amplification of E. histolytica genomic DNA
using primers based on these putative E. histolytica EhiscS

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/4/7

sequences and on a putative EhiscU sequence (accession
number: AY040613) generated products of the expected
size. DNA sequencing confirmed the identity of the
amplified clones. The 5' untranslated regions of EhiscU
and EhiscS contain distinct putative promoter elements
reported to be typical for E. histolytica [23]. All three conserved regions are present in the first 40 bases upstream
the initiation codon of iscU and iscS (Fig. 1), suggesting
both genes are functional, although the GAAC-element is
less well conserved in the iscU promoter region. The E. histolytica IscU protein is 348 amino acids in length and has
a predicted molecular mass of 38.9 kDa and a predicted
isoelectric point of 5.71. Its large size indicates it is a longform IscU, similar to the one described for Azotobacter
vinelandii [24], and not a short form as found in other
eukaryotes (Fig. 2). For IscS these values are 390 amino
acids, 42.8 kDa, and 5.92, respectively. The GC values for
the iscU (iscS) genes are 33 % (32 %) for the coding
region, 29 % (25 %) for the 5' untranslated region and 29
% (18 %) for the 3' untranslated region (250 bp each).
These values are in agreement with GC values reported for
other E. histolytica genes based on 75,615 codons analyzed
[25]. Codon usage is also similar to E. histolytica codon
usage and no introns are present in either of these two
genes.
Both E. histolytica IscU and IscS contain structural motifs
typical of FeS assembly proteins. Pfam (PF01106,
PF01592), PRODOM (PD002830), and InterProScan
(IPR001075, IPR002871) motifs characteristic of IscU
and NifU proteins are present in the E. histolytica homolog
(Fig. 2A) [26-28]. E. histolytica IscS contains Pfam
(PF00266), PROSITE (PS00595), and InterProScan
(IPR000192) motifs that are normally associated with
aminotransferase class V proteins, a subfamily of the aminotransferase proteins. IscS is one of the eight members of
the class V subfamily (Fig. 2A). As indicated above, IscU
has an extension at the carboxy-terminus relative to most
IscU homologs. This extension is also present on the A.
vinelandii NifU gene whose amino-terminal part is homologous to that of IscU. In addition, this C-terminal extension is similar to a completely different gene from
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Nfu1 (NifU-like in Fig. 2B). Since
Nfu1- and Isu-like sequences are part of the same gene in
Azotobacter, Campylobacter, Entamoeba and Helicobacter it
could be inferred that both proteins interact with each
other when found on two separate genes. Such informative fusion proteins (or Rosetta Stone sequences) indicate
an interaction between protein pairs [29]. The existence of
long IscU isoforms would therefore suggest that the Nfu1
and Isu1/2 proteins do interact in yeast as postulated by
Garland et al. [30].
Both proteins align along their whole length to homologous proteins from other organisms (Fig. 3). Residues

Figure 1 of the 5'-flanking region of E. histolytica iscU (A) and iscS (B) encoding genes
Overview
Overview of the 5'-flanking region of E. histolytica iscU (A) and iscS (B) encoding genes. The three typical upstream
regulatory elements are depicted as by Purdy et al [23]; the putative initiator element, double underlined; the `GAAC'-element,
grey box; and the putative TATA element, boxed.

implicated in function are conserved in both IscU and IscS
proteins. The three cysteine residues that are conserved in
Escherichia coli IscU which provide a scaffold for the
assembly of iron-sulfur clusters [14] are conserved in the
E. histolytica protein (Fig. 3A). In addition, in E. coli one of
these IscU cysteines interacts with a conserved cysteine
from IscS which is also present in the E. histolytica IscS
(Figs. 3A and 3B). Most residues considered to be important for IscS function are also present on the E. histolytica
protein (Fig. 3B). To test whether the E. histolytica IscS protein assumes a normal three-dimensional conformation,
this protein was modeled on the solved NifS protein structure from Thermotoga maritima. The overall topology of
both proteins is quite similar and the force field energy of
the computed E. histolytica IscS model is -13,800 kJ/mol,
indicating an energetically plausible model [31]. The
putative active site architecture of E. histolytica IscS and the
solved active site of T. maritima NifS show similar structures (Fig. 4). The ring of the cofactor vitamin B6 (or pyridoxal-5'-phosphate; PLP) is sandwiched between
EhHis106/TmHis99 and EhThr184/TmVal179 and further fixed by residues EhAsp182/TmAsp177 and
EhGln185/TmGln180. The phosphate-group is anchored
by six hydrogen bonds from EhThr76/TmThr71,
EhHis207/TmHis202,
EhThr198/TmSer200,
and
EhThr243/TmThr238 [32]. The presence of all residues
considered to be important for IscU and IscS activity on
the E. histolytica proteins suggest that these proteins are
indeed involved in FeS cluster assembly.
No N-terminal or C-terminal organelle targeting domains
could be unambiguously identified in E. histolytica IscS/U
proteins using subcellular localization and targeting prediction software (e.g., PSORT II [33], MitoProt [34],
NNPSL [35]). The C-terminal signature motif which is
considered to be characteristic of proteobacterial and
eukaryotic IscS proteins [20] is not present in homologs

from E. histolytica, Campylobacter or Azotobacter (Fig. 3B).
Because these organisms all possess the long-type IscU
isoforms, it is possible that the extended IscU protein
might negate the need for the C-terminal signature residues on the interacting IscS protein. However, functional
studies using deletion mutants are needed to confirm this
hypothesis.
Phylogenetic analyses of the E. histolytica FeS cluster
assembly proteins
Bayesian and maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic
analyses of E. histolytica IscU and IscS protein sequences
revealed that the Entamoeba Isc proteins form a well supported clade with Helicobacter pylori and Campylobacter
jejuni – two bacteria encountered in the human digestive
tract – to the exclusion of all other prokaryotic and
eukaryotic homologs (Fig. 5). All three independent Bayesian analyses converged on the same tree with similar posterior probabilities. For IscU, the ML tree had a slightly
better likelihood than the Bayesian tree, while for IscS
both trees had similar likelihoods. The overall topologies
of IscS and IscU phylogenetic trees are very similar to each
other and major taxonomic clades like plants, animals,
and fungi are well conserved. The position of the microsporidium Encephalitozoon cuniculi in the IscU tree is
poorly resolved as indicated by the very low support for
this node at the base of the metazoa, contrary to its welldocumented association with fungi [36].

The position of Rickettsia prowazekii IscS basal to the
eukaryotes suggests that eukaryotic IscS proteins originated from the mitochondrial endosymbiont, since this
bacterium is considered to be a close relative to the mitochondrial ancestor. Indeed, the mitochondrial ancestry of
E. cuniculi, T. vaginalis and G. intestinalis IscS proteins is
strongly supported by their clustering with mitochondrial
homologs [15,20,37]. For IscU, the base of the eukaryotic

clade is not well resolved. Animals and plants cluster
together with a proteobacterial sister clade containing the
α-proteobacterium R. prowazekii, while fungi, G. intestinalis, and the alveolates are basal to this clade. However, the
well-supported clustering of E. histolytica Isc proteins with
homologs from the bacteria H. pylori and C. jejuni, to the
exclusion of all other eukaryotes, suggests that E. histolytica acquired its isc genes laterally from ε-proteobacteria
(Fig. 5). This suggestion is further supported by the fact
that Campylobacter, Helicobacter and E. histolytica all
possess long form IscU proteins to the exclusion of the
short isoforms found in eukaryotic organisms and in
many bacterial taxa (see orange branches in Fig. 5).
Mitochondrial-type IscS/U proteins have been identified
in several amitochondrial eukaryotes including Giardia,
Encephalitozoon, Trichomonas and Cryptosporidium, and
there is significant direct and indirect evidence that these
proteins are targeted into their highly derived mitochondrion-related organelles [12,15,16,20]. Thus, E. histolytica
appears to be unique amongst eukaryotic organisms that
contain mitochondrion-related organelles in harbouring
bacterial-type IscS/U proteins. That no mitochondrial-

type IscS/U proteins have thus far been identified in E. histolytica would suggest that its original mitochondrial-type
iscS/U genes were replaced during the course of evolution
by the more recently acquired bacterial homologs. However, since the E. histolytica genome has not yet been fully
sequenced, the possibility that mitochondrial type iscS/U
genes might have escaped detection cannot be formally
excluded.
Since both E. histolytica Isc proteins form a strongly supported clade with homologs from gut bacteria, we
investigated whether other intestinal inhabitants would
form part of this clade. The genomes of 23 bacterial and 2
eukaryotic inhabitants of the human gut were screened
using E. histolytica IscU and IscS as query sequences, but
no additional homologs were identified. Only a fraction
of the estimated 400–500 bacteria species living in the
human intestine [38] have been sequenced and therefore
we may not have been able to identify any other members
of this clade due to sampling limitations. Nevertheless,
the most parsimonious explanation for the clustering of E.
histolytica Isc proteins with those of bacteria is that E. histolytica, or its ancestors, acquired its iscS/U genes by
horizontal gene transfer (HGT), a well-documented contributor to prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome evolution.
In higher eukaryotes the most obvious example of HGT is
the relocation of genes from endosymbiosis-derived
organelles to the cell nucleus, which might be regarded as
a special case of HGT. However, over the past few years
evidence has accumulated of the frequent incorporation
of genes into the genomes of microbial eukaryotes by
HGT [39-47]. The transfer of bacterial genes into eukaryotes might occur in several possible ways. One hypothesis
is the `you are what you eat' gene transfer ratchet of HGT
which suggests that when a genome is continuously bombarded with DNA, some of these genes might eventually
replace the host's own genes [48]. Since both Helicobacter
and Campylobacter occupy the same ecological niche as E.
histolytica, an avid consumer of gut bacteria, HGT via this
mechanism seems plausible. Establishing unequivocally
the timing of HGT will be important to test this
hypothesis.
Analysis of the organization of Isc/Nif loci on the
genomes of several bacteria revealed the presence of a
small Isc operon consisting exclusively of IscU and IscS in
H. pylori and C. jejuni, whilst the well-studied E. coli and
A. vinelandii isc operons contained several other genes
involved in FeS cluster assembly (see Fig. 6). This observation provides a mechanistic explanation for the presence
of two interacting proteins with similar ancestry in the
genome of E. histolytica. It is possible that E. histolytica
might have incorporated the entire isc operon from Helicobacter/Campylobacter, or from their ancestors, into its
genome in a single transfer event. Once freed from the

Alignment
Alignment of the putative E. histolytica IscU and IscS with homologs from C. jejuni, A. vinelandii, R. prowazekii,
S. cerevisiae, and H. sapiens. A. Alignment of the E. histolytica long-form IscU with similar isoforms from C. jejuni and A. vinelandii. In addition, short-form IscU homologs from R. prowazekii, S. cerevisiae, and H. sapiens are aligned concatenated with their
Nfu1 homologs (arrow indicates start of Nfu1 homologs) which resemble the C-terminal extension found on the long-form
IscU. The conserved cysteine residues which provide a scaffold for the IscS-directed sequential assembly of labile FeS-clusters
[14] are boxed. The cysteine residue that forms a disulfide bridge with a conserved cysteine residue on IscS (see B) is indicated
by a closed square (■). The yeast Nfu1 mitochondrial transit peptide has been deleted. B. Alignment of the E. histolytica IscS
with homologs from the above mentioned organisms. Important residues for function are as described by Tachezy, Sánchez
and Müller [20]; the conserved lysine involved in co-factor binding (pyridoxal-5'-phosphate, PLP) is indicated by a closed circle
(●), other residues involved in PLP interaction are indicated by open circles (❍), the cysteine residue that forms a disulfide
bridge with a cysteine residue on IscU (see A) is indicated by a closed box (■), residues involved in substrate binding (Lcysteine) are indicated by open squares (ᮀ), the conserved histidine involved in substrate deprotonation is indicated by an
arrow. Typical eukaryotic/eubacterial conserved cysteine and C-terminal residues are boxed. Note that organisms that contain
a long-form IscU (see Fig. 2B and 3A) do not have these conserved residues suggesting that the C-terminal IscU extension
might take over the role of these residues. Part of the mitochondrial transit peptides from the yeast and human IscS homologs
have been omitted (~) for reasons of clarity. Amino acids were shaded according to similarity/identity scores: dark grey indicates fully conserved residues while light grey indicates similar residues according to the PAM250 matrix [59].

Model of the active site of E.histolytica IscS and Thermotoga maritima NifS
Figure 4
Model of the active site of E. histolytica IscS and Thermotoga maritima NifS. The E. histolytica IscS putative threedimensional structure (A) was deduced using the conceptually translated iscS sequence. The previously solved crystal structure
of T. maritima NifS (B) [PDB accession number: 1EG5, [32]] was used as a template. The E. histolytica IscS sequence was aligned
to the T. maritima NifS sequence using DeepView v3.7 [http://www.expasy.org/spdbv/, [60]] and manually improved based on
an independent Clustal W alignment [54]. Only residues involved in co-factor (PLP) and substrate (Cys) binding were selected
in order to show the active site.

constraints of operon-type prokaryotic gene expression,
the iscS/U genes might have become separated in the E.
histolytica genome during the course of evolution.

Conclusions
E. histolytica or its ancestors appear to have acquired their
iscS/U genes by HGT from ε-proteobacteria. The apparent
absence of mitochondrial-type IscS/U proteins in an
organism with mitochondrion-bearing ancestors such as
E. histolytica suggests that its original mitochondrial iscS/U
genes might have been replaced with the more recently
acquired bacterial homologs. This finding, like several
other recently reported cases of prokaryote to eukaryote
gene transfers [39-47], highlights the important role
played by HGT in protozoan genome evolution. Since no
recent HGT events from prokaryotes to humans have been
detected in the human genome [49], HGT from bacteria
to protozoan parasites might have important implications
for public health. Targeting enzymes or metabolic pathways of bacterial origin in human pathogens should have
more severe consequences for the parasite than for its
host, making these proteins promising targets for
chemotherapy.

Methods
Organism and DNA isolation
E. histolytica HM-1:IMSS clone 9 was maintained axenically by subculture in YI-S medium with 15% adult
bovine serum as described [50]. Entamoeba genomic DNA
was isolated using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide
(CTAB) according to Clark [51].
Cloning and sequencing of the E. histolytica iscS and iscU
genes
Standard recombinant DNA techniques were used as
described elsewhere [52]. PCR was performed on isolated
E. histolytica genomic DNA. Primers were designed using
Primer3 [53]. The EhiscU gene was amplified using primers based on a NifU-like E. histolytica sequence (accession
number AY040613). The primers were Eh_IscU_936F, 5'CCA ACG TAT CGC CAC GAA AA-3' and Eh_IscU_2270R,
5'-GCA AAA CAA AGT ATG GCA GAA GCA-3' for forward
and reverse primers, respectively. The EhiscS gene was
identified on the E. histolytica genome by BLAST searches
of preliminary data generated by the Entamoeba genome
sequencing project [17] using G. intestinalis GiiscS (accession number AAK39427) as the query sequence. Putative

Phylogenetic analysis of E. histolytica IscS and IscU protein sequences using a similar taxonomic sampling
Figure 5
Phylogenetic analysis of E. histolytica IscS and IscU protein sequences using a similar taxonomic sampling.
Depicted are unrooted maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees of 29 IscS (left) and 28 IscU (right) protein sequences. The E.
histolytica sequences are recovered as part of a well supported monophyletic group comprising the gut bacteria H. pylori and C.
jejuni. The orange branches represent those sequences containing the long IscU isoform. Numbers in red represent posterior
probabilities as determined by MrBayes [55] where a value of 1.0 represents maximum support (only values above 0.75 are
shown). Values in blue represent bootstrap values as determined using PHYML [57], only bootstrap values above 50% are
shown.

EhiscS gene sequences (1000 bases up- and downstream
of the ORF) were used for primer design. The EhiscS coding region was amplified using primers Eh_IscS_681F, 5'CAA GTG CGA ATA CCC AAT TTG AA-3' and
Eh_IscS_2515R, 5'-GGC TGA AGC CAT GAC ACC TC-3'
(forward and reverse primers, respectively). The resulting
PCR fragments were all cloned into pGEM-T-Easy
(Promega) and sequenced to confirm their identity. The
new E. histolytica IscS sequence has been deposited in
Genbank (accession number AY277946).
Phylogenetic analyses
The conceptually translated E. histolytica IscS and IscU
amino acid sequences were aligned using Clustal W [54]
to reference sequences from Genbank. The alignments
were manually refined and only unambiguously aligned
regions without gaps were used for phylogenetic analysis,

leaving data sets of 28 taxa with 116 amino acid positions
(IscU) and a similar taxon set consisting of 29 taxa with
326 amino acid positions (IscS). Likelihood searches were
performed in a Bayesian framework under the JTT-f substitution model accommodating site rate variation (fraction of invariable sites plus four variable gamma rates)
using the program MrBayes [55]. All analyses started with
randomly generated trees and ran for 200,000 generations, with sampling at intervals of 100 generations that
produced 2,000 trees. To ensure that the analyses were not
trapped on local optima, the data set was run three times
independently, each run beginning with a different starting tree. The log-likelihood values of the 2,000 trees in
each analysis were plotted against the generation time
(not shown). Although the likelihood model stabilized
very rapidly, only the last 1,500 trees in each of the three
independent analyses were used to estimate separate 50%

majority rule consensus trees for these. The frequency of
any particular clade, among the individual trees contributing to the consensus tree, represents the posterior probability of that clade [55]. For the maximum likelihood
analyses, protein data sets were resampled 100 times
using SEQBOOT from PHYLIP [56]. These resampled
datasets were analysed using PHYML [57] with alpha and
invariant sites parameters optimized on the Bayesian tree
in TREE-PUZZLE 5.0 [58] with a mixed four-category discrete gamma plus invariable sites model of rate heterogeneity. The JTT substitution model was used in the protein
analyses. Majority rule consensus trees were obtained
from the resulting 100 trees using CONSENSE (PHYLIP).
