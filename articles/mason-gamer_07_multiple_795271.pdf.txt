Abstract
Background: Stowaway elements are short, non-autonomous DNA transposons categorized as
miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs). The high MITE copy number in grass
genomes suggests an active history of amplification and insertion, but ongoing MITE activity has only
rarely been seen, and ongoing Stowaway activity has never been observed. Thus, a phylogenetic
perspective on presence vs. absence of elements in an aligned data set can provide valuable
historical insights into the dynamics of MITE acquisition and loss.
Results: A Stowaway-like element resides within the fourth intron of a β-amylase gene in
representatives of five genera in the wheat tribe, Triticeae. Its presence vs. absence was examined
with reference to the β-amylase gene tree topology, and in light of sequence comparisons of the
β-amylase elements to Triticeae Stowaway elements in the Entrez nucleotide database. Among the
sequences lacking the element, there are five distinct putative excision footprints (one widespread
and four restricted to unrelated lineages) and two flanking deletions. The sequences that do contain
elements are polyphyletic on the β-amylase tree, and their elements are divergent at the sequence
level. The β-amylase elements do not form a monophyletic group relative to other Stowaway
elements in Entrez; most are more similar to elements from other loci in other Triticeae genomes
than they are to one another.
Conclusion: Combined, the phylogenetic distribution, sequence variation, and Entrez database
comparisons indicate that a Stowaway-like element has undergone multiple deletions from and
insertions into the same site in β-amylase intron 4 during the history of the tribe. The elements
currently at the site represent multiple, distinct lineages that transcend generic boundaries. While
patterns of Stowaway polymorphism across a phylogenetic data set do not allow evolutionary
mechanisms to be inferred with certainty, they do provide insights into the dynamics of element
evolution over an extended time scale. The historical perspective provided by a phylogenetic
approach is complementary to the few studies in which ongoing MITE activity has been
documented.

Background
Transposable elements (TEs) are divided into two main
classes depending on their mode of transposition [1]:
class I elements transpose through an RNA intermediate
using a reverse transcriptase, while class II elements transpose through a DNA intermediate. Class II elements are
further classified as either autonomous elements, which
include a gene encoding a transposase, or non-autonomous elements, which do not encode a functional transposase. Miniature inverted-repeat (IR) transposable
elements (MITEs) are members of a highly repetitive category of class II non-autonomous elements, and are
extremely abundant in plant genomes [2-4]. These small
(<500 bp) elements are recognized by their by short terminal inverted repeats (TIRs), and 2–3 bp target site
duplications (TSDs).
MITEs are further grouped into families based on differences among their TIR sequences and TSDs, and on their
relationships to known autonomous elements from
which the families appear to have been derived [5]. The
subset of MITEs categorized as Stowaway elements [6]
share similar 10-bp TIRs (consensus CTCCCTCCRT), a 2bp target site preference (5'-TA-3'), and the potential to
form secondary structures [7,8]. Transposition of Stowaway elements is hypothesized to be associated with autonomous mariner-like elements based on their TIR
similarities [8], on the discovery of Stowaway elements
with open reading frames that share sequence similarity
with known mariner transposases [9-11], and on the
observed interaction between mariner-like transposases
and Stowaway MITEs in rice [12].
Because very few MITEs have been observed to be actively
transposing, the dynamics underlying their gain, loss, and
high copy number are not well understood [5]. Aligned
sequence data, however, can help clarify certain aspects of
MITE evolution over a longer time scale [13]. The present
study uses phylogenetic information to analyze patterns
of sequence diversity and presence vs. absence of Stowaway-like elements in the fourth intron of a β-amylase gene,
using aligned sequences from a broadly representative
sample of the wheat tribe, Triticeae. Two main observations reveal a complex history of multiple losses and multiple gains of the element. First, the sequence variation
adjacent to the empty sites, and its phylogenetic distribution, suggests numerous independent losses. There are
five distinct putative excision footprints: one that is widespread throughout the sample, and four that are restricted
to unrelated lineages. Two additional empty sites, in unrelated sequences, are associated with deletions flanking
intron sequence. Second, the occurrence of divergent elements at the same site in the gene, and their phylogenetic
distribution, suggest multiple acquisitions of elements at
the site. The sequences that have elements, representing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/92

five Triticeae genera, are polyphyletic on the β-amylase
gene tree. More strikingly, four of the five β-amylase elements show greater similarity to elements in other genes
and in other Triticeae genomes than they do to one
another; i.e., the elements at this site do not form a monophyletic group relative to other known Stowaway elements. Taken together, these sequence comparisons
highlight the complex evolutionary history of Stowawaylike elements at this locus.

Results

Short, palindromic insertions were found in β-amylase
intron 4 in representatives of five Triticeae genera (Fig. 1).
They appear to be Stowaway elements, based on their size,
their conserved 10-bp terminal repeats, their palindromic
structure, and their TA insertion site [7]. From sequence
information alone, however, it is impossible to determine
whether these specific palindromic structures behave like
true Stowaway elements, i.e., whether they have the potential to be excised by mariner-like transposases, or whether
they occur in the very high copy numbers characteristic of
Stowaway elements. Based on results of searches of the
Entrez nucleotide database (see below), the five elements
vary in their frequency of occurrence at non-homologous
sites in Triticeae genomes, yielding between 3 and 81 hits
in the database. However, while Stowaway elements are
collectively numerous, there is no reason to assume that
every Stowaway variant will have a very high copy number.
This is a highly dynamic group of rapidly-evolving
sequences, and their history (in rice, at least) appears to
have involved several temporally-separated waves of
amplification [8]. Thus, abundances of different Stowaway
variants are expected to vary widely (and change through
time).
Although the characteristic TIRs and TSDs of the five βamylase elements are easy to align, the regions between
the TIRs (excluded from Fig. 1 alignment) are variable in
both length and sequence (Fig. 2). Australopyrum retrofractum and Au. velutinum have nearly identical 158-bp elements (98.7% sequence identity), Aegilops comosa
contains an 83-bp element, Peridictyon sanctum has an 82bp element, Henrardia persica has a 71-bp element, and
Crithopsis delileana contains a 100-bp element. (Aegilops
uniaristata contains a 38-bp partially degraded element
that is 94.7% similar to the 5' end of the Ae. comosa element.) The Ae. comosa and P. sanctum elements are easy to
align (1 bp length difference; 89% identity), as are the C.
delileana and H. persica elements, though these differ in
length (29 bp length difference, 94.4% identity excluding
gaps; Fig. 2). Other pairwise combinations of the β-amylase elements cannot be unambiguously aligned (Fig. 2).
Most of the β-amylase sequences show evidence of element excision and/or degradation, including several dis-

tinct footprints that are consistent with the proposed
mechanism of excision of a rice Tc1/mariner element in an
experimental yeast system [14]. Nearly all of the empty
sites, and all of the element-containing sites, are flanked
by TA...GTA (Fig. 1, black italics). In addition to this widespread footprint, sequences representing four genera have
distinct excision footprints consisting of short TIR fragments (Fig. 1, red italics). These flank empty sites in Pseudoroegneria
spicata
(footprint
TACTCC...AGTA);
Psathyrostachys juncea (TATCC...AGTA); Thinopyrum elongatum (TACT...AGTA); and a now-occupied site in Australopyrum retrofractum and Au. velutinum (TACTC...AGTA).
Finally, two sequences lack the element along with portions of the intron flanking the empty site (Fig. 1), including Aegilops tauschii (missing 6 bp 5' and 10 bp 3' of the
putative insertion site), and Psathyrostachys fragilis (miss-

ing only the original TA insertion site). It is not clear
whether the deletions are associated with element loss.
Although the β-amylase elements differ from one another,
BLAST searches of the Entrez nucleotide database reveal
that each shows marked similarity to one or more putative
Stowaway elements at other loci in other Triticeae
genomes (Table 1). The Australopyrum elements yield 81
close matches (with "close match" defined here as a
sequence that covers 85–100% of the query sequence with
85–100% identity); this is the largest number of close
matches obtained. These are found at multiple loci in the
genomes of barley, wheat, rye, and in two diploid wheat
progenitors, thus illustrating the broad distribution of this
particular element type throughout Triticeae genomes.
Three of these are shown (Fig. 3a, Table 1), including one

some diploid wheat relatives (not shown), including:

matches to the Ae. comosa β-amylase element, the closest
is the P. sanctum β-amylase element (1 bp length difference, 89% identity), but the closest match (out of six) to
the P. sanctum element is from barley, near a hypersensitive-induced response (HIR) gene (equal in length and
93.9% identity; Fig. 3b, Table 1). Of the 22 close matches
to the H. persica element, one of the closest is in a barley
gene for a putative RNA binding protein (1 bp length difference, 95.8% identity; Fig. 3c, Table 1). The C. delileana

though slightly less similar in sequence, to an element in a Hordeum starch synthase II gene (black, bottom line). Table 1 provides details about the length and sequence comparisons shown here.

element is 95% identical to the H. persica element (Fig. 3c,
Table 1), but is a full 29 bp longer. Because of the length
difference, it is not among the 14 closest matches as
defined above; one of these is near a barley starch synthase (SSII) gene (7 bp length difference, 92.5% identity;
Fig. 3c, Table 1).
The phylogenetic analysis of the β-amylase data set
yielded a single ML tree with a score of -lnL = 8846.175
(Fig. 4) [15]. The branching pattern is consistent with the
recovery of a single β-amylase homolog, in that most of
the genera from which multiple accessions have been
sampled form monophyletic groups (Secale, Australopyrum, Dasypyrum, Hordeum, Pseudoroegneria, and Taeniatherum); this pattern is indicative of orthology. Most of the
non-monophyletic genera on this tree are non-monophyletic on other gene trees (Eremopyrum, Aegilops, and
Thinopyrum) [15]; thus, their non-monophyly on the βamylase tree does not suggest paralogy. The polyphyletic
placement of H. jubatum reflects its tetraploid origin. The
most unexpected result is the placement of sequences
from Aegilops comosa and Ae. uniaristata far from their
expected relatives in Aegilops and Triticum. These outlying
copies were not recovered from any other Aegilops species,
despite repeated attempts. A duplication event deep
enough in the tree to explain the two Aegilops outliers as
paralogs (i.e., a basal duplication) should be apparent in
most, if not all, of the genera. Thus, as discussed earlier
[15], the Aegilops outliers are more consistent with introgression than with ancestral duplication. The interpretation of the β-amylase tree with respect to the evolution of
the Triticeae, and relative to other molecular phylogenetic
analyses of the tribe, has been discussed [15]; the present
paper focuses on its significance with regard to the evolution of the Stowaway elements in intron 4.
Sequence variation among empty sites and among complete elements, and their distributions on the β-amylase
tree (Fig. 4), suggest a complex history of acquisition and
loss. A single early acquisition of an element would
explain the broad phylogenetic distribution of footprints
and elements throughout the tribe, but would require as
many as 11 independent losses to explain the phylogenetic distribution of the widespread TA...GTA footprints,
in addition to the four losses leaving distinct footprints
(Pseudoroegneria spicata, Psathyrostachys juncea, Thinopyrum
elongatum, and Australopyrum retrofractum and Au. velutinum). A scenario involving multiple insertions into the
same site would require as many as five independent
acquisitions, or at least three if nodes with low bootstrap
support are discounted. If all of the sequences that may
have formerly had elements were included (those with
putative footprints or deletions of the flanking intron;
labeled in Fig. 4), then additional acquisitions (followed
by excisions) must be inferred. Note that this scenario

not account for the sequence differences among the elements, or their similarities to Triticeae Stowaway elements
at non-orthologous loci.

Discussion
The utility of phylogenetic information for understanding
the evolutionary dynamics of Stowaway excision was demonstrated in another example from the Triticeae, which
provided evidence for multiple losses of an element from
a gene encoding a disrupted meiotic cDNA 1 (DMC1)
protein [13]. The present study, based on elements and

Page 6 of 10

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:92

excision footprints in the fourth intron of a β-amylase
gene, provides evidence that both losses and gains have
occurred repeatedly in this intron.
In general, multiple independent losses of Stowaway elements seem feasible, and even likely. First, the elements
are palindromes, and DNA palindromes have long been
recognized for their instability. Their tendency to form
hairpin structures appears to facilitate slipped-strand mispairing by bringing short, terminal direct repeats into
close proximity [16-18]. Thus, their inverted-repeat structure may facilitate their degradation. Second, Stowaway
elements could be excised during transposition. Although
they do not encode a transposase, the resemblance
between the TIRs and subterminal sequences of Stowaway
MITEs and mariner-like class II elements [5,8], and the
demonstrated physical interaction between mariner-like
transposases and Stowaway MITEs from rice [12], support
a mechanism of Stowaway excision by a mariner-encoded
transposase [19]. No Stowaway elements have been demonstrated to be currently active, but the DMC1 [13] and βamylase gene data sets, both of which sample broadly
throughout the Triticeae, reveal losses occurring over the
time scale of the tribe's history, which by one estimate
began between 13 and 25 million years ago [20]. The halfelement in Ae. uniaristata shows a clear case of degradation of an element similar to the one in Ae. comosa. Otherwise, the inferred sites of element loss fall into two
categories: (a) five different apparent excision footprints,
consisting of 2–4 bp adjacent to the 5' terminal TA duplication, and 1–2 bp adjacent to the 3' TA duplication; and
(b) two small deletions of the intron sequence flanking
empty element sites.
Because active Stowaway excision has not been observed,
and MITE excision in general observed only rarely, exactly
what a Stowaway excision footprint should look like is not
known. Transposition footprints from the rice MITE
mPing, the only group of MITEs observed to be actively
transposing, have been characterized in several recent
studies [21-24]. However, mPing is associated with a different transposase superfamily (PIF/Harbinger) than is
Stowaway (Tc1/mariner); thus, mPing footprints might not
be good predictors of Stowaway footprints. Here, inferences are drawn from historical losses of Stowaway from a
different Triticeae gene [13], and from observed excisions
of Osmar5, a rice Tc1/mariner element, in an experimental
yeast system [14]. The inferred Stowaway footprints from
the Triticeae DMC1 gene [13] are similar to those
observed in the β-amylase dataset, with 1–4 bp TIR fragments internal to the terminal TA duplications. Like the βamylase dataset, the DMC1 dataset includes several distinct footprints at orthologous sites within the gene; these
were interpreted as evidence of either multiple excisions,
or evolution of an ancestral footprint following a single

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/92

excision event [13]. The putative footprints from both the
DMC1 and β-amylase data sets are consistent with the
proposed mechanism of excision of the rice Osmar5 element in yeast [14], which also yielded footprints with 1–
4 bp TIR fragments adjacent to the TA duplications.
Whether or not the two β-amylase sequences with deletions adjacent to the empty sites represent additional
cases of element loss is not clear, although one case of
Osmar5 excision from yeast did involve deletions of flanking sequence [14].
While multiple deletions of a transposon are to be
expected, there also appear to have been multiple independent insertions of Stowaway elements into orthologous sites within intron 4. This would explain their
polyphyletic distribution on the β-amylase tree, their
sequence diversity, and their marked similarities to elements at non-homologous sites in other genomes. In
addition, the Australopyrum sequences provide clear evidence of multiple insertions at the same site in the same
sequence: the current full element was inserted at the
same TA recognition site as an earlier element, which has
since been excised leaving a footprint. Transposons do not
generally integrate into random sites [25,26]; not only do
they insert at specific target site sequences, but available
target sites are not selected at random. Some Oryza and
Zea MITEs, for example, are more likely to be found
within other MITEs, and they sometimes target specific
sites within those MITEs [27]. Extreme specificity, involving multiple insertions into the exact same site in the
genome, has been demonstrated for a variety of transposons. Cases involve both class I elements, including
SINEs in Peromyscus [28] and ingi LINEs and RIME SINEs
in Trypanosoma [29], and class II elements, including a
Pokey element in Daphnia [30], hobo elements in Drosophila [31], and a striking example of six independent
insertions of two distinct PIF elements into the same location in an r-gene in Zea [32]. Site-specific insertions by
members of the Tc1/mariner transposon family (which
includes Stowaway) have been associated with features
adjacent to preferred TA insertion sites, including the specific sequence immediately flanking the insertion site of
Tc1 in Caenorhabditis elegans [33], and the predicted deformation of DNA at sites of Sleeping Beauty insertion during
interplasmid transposition in HeLa cells, and into Mus
sequences [34]. Specific features associated with Stowaway
insertion site preference in the Triticeae might be clarified
by extensive comparisons among the sequences flanking
multiple non-homologous insertion sites. No Triticeae
species have been fully sequenced, but there is extensive
sequence data available from wheat, barley, and rye. Thus,
while it would not be possible to carry out as thorough a
genome-wide survey of Stowaway elements as was recently
done for rice [8], the large number of sequenced Triticeae
elements in Entrez should provide an excellent starting

flanking

One alternative hypothesis to multiple gains is that there
was a single gain early in the history of the tribe, and that
the observed diversity among the β-amylase elements
arose at that site. Given the wide distribution of the
TA...GTA excision footprint, there probably was, in fact,
an ancestral element at the site, but that element is probably not ancestral to the present elements at the site. First,
all of the current elements are themselves enclosed within
TA...GTA footprints; thus, the putative earlier element was
excised, and did not evolve into the elements now in
place. Second, the five current elements are all palindromes, with strong predicted secondary structure. If a
single ancestral palindrome has simply evolved very rapidly, the resulting sequences would not maintain any palindromic structure. Similarly, if a large ancestral element
were to differentially decay into a series of independently
derived smaller elements, the derivatives would not be
palindromes. (One feasible exception to this assertion
would be a sequential deletion of the central portion of a
large palindrome, which would lead to a series of nested
palindromes of decreasing size, but this is not the pattern
seen here.) The second problem with the single-gain
hypothesis cannot be easily dismissed. The similarity of
the β-amylase variants to Stowaway elements at other loci
in other genomes, rather than to one another, strongly
refutes the monophyly of the β-amylase elements. Otherwise, whatever process produced the five β-amylase elements from a single ancestor would have to have been
operating in parallel at multiple loci in multiple genomes.
The similarity among Stowaway elements from different
genomes (e.g., Australopyrum, Hordeum, Secale, and Triticum; Fig. 3a), and diversity among elements within
genomes (e.g., the Hordeum elements in Fig. 3), highlight
a disconnect between the evolutionary relationships
among the elements and the relationships among the species and genera that harbor them. This disconnect is consistent either with the existence of multiple Stowaway
lineages in the ancestral Triticeae genome, or with horizontal transfer of elements among Triticeae lineages. The
observed high level of diversity among the Stowaway elements suggests that some of the distinct Stowaway lineages
are old, and possibly already present in the ancestral Triticeae genome. On the other hand, the close similarity
among some of the elements that are shared by phylogenetically distinct genera suggests recent movement of elements among genera. The history of hybridization and
introgression among divergent Triticeae lineages [35]
would facilitate horizontal transfer, and the spread of
Stowaway variants among species. Thus, ancestral polymorphism and ongoing introgression may both play a
role in the present element diversity, but it is difficult to

disentangle these possibilities, especially without a better
understanding of how the elements evolve. If, for example, they evolve extremely quickly, the suggestion that the
lineages are old based on their high level of divergence is
not valid. One possible way to gain additional insights
into the age of the Stowaway lineages of the Triticeae
would be to survey Stowaway variation in genera related
to, but outside of the tribe. Phylogenetic relationships
linking Triticeae elements to multiple lineages outside the
tribe would be consistent with shared ancestral polymorphism.
The high level of homoplasy exhibited by the intron 4
Stowaway elements is unmistakable, given the phylogenetic context provided by the β-amylase gene tree; there is
little correspondence between presence vs. absence of the
element and the phylogenetic estimate. In any case, the
character states "present" and "absent" have little meaning here because the elements that are present, though
found at orthologous sites within the gene, are not themselves related as orthologs, and sites from which the element is absent are variable in terms of sequence. Thus,
while the presence vs. absence of a Stowaway element has
been used for phylogenetic inference in AA-genome species of rice [36,37], the general utility of MITEs as phylogenetic markers at higher taxonomic levels should not be
assumed [13]. The specific genetic mechanisms underlying the homoplastic losses and gains cannot be determined from the observed historical patterns alone, but the
phylogenetic perspective does reveal the complexity of
MITE evolutionary dynamics over time, and complements
recent studies documenting ongoing activity of MITEs and
mariner-like elements.

Conclusion
Stowaway MITEs have undergone multiple deletions from
and insertions into the same site in β-amylase intron 4
during the history of the tribe. Multiple losses are supported by sequence variation among the putative sites of
element excision/degradation, and the phylogenetic distribution of those sites. Multiple gains are supported by
the polyphyletic distribution of five β-amylase elements,
and their non-monophyly relative to elements at nonorthologous loci in other Triticeae genomes. The complex
history of gains and losses contraindicates the use of
either the presence vs. absence of, or sequence comparisons among, these elements for organismal phylogeny
reconstruction. While phylogenetic analyses of historical
element activity do not allow genetic mechanisms of gain
and loss to be inferred, they do provide insights into the
long-term dynamics of element evolution. Thus, the historical perspective provided by a phylogenetic approach is
complementary to studies of ongoing transposon activity.

Methods

A set of aligned Triticeae β-amylase sequences [Genbank:AY821686–AY821734] was generated for a phylogenetic study of the tribe [15]; the taxon list with authorities
and accession numbers, and the laboratory methods used
for obtaining the sequences, are provided therein. Briefly,
a 1400-bp portion of the ubiquitously-expressed β-amylase gene [38] was amplified using primers in exon 2 (2afor, GCCATCATGTCRTTCCACCA) and exon 5 (5a-bac,
TCRGCTGCATGGTTTGGAAC) [15], and amplified products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vectors (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). Cloned products were amplified
directly from colonies and cleaned using shrimp alkaline
phosphatase and exonuclease I (USB, Cleveland, OH,
USA). After cleaning, fragments were sequenced with
BigDye Terminator v. 3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) using the amplification primers and four
internal primers (3a-bac, ATGAATTCTCCRAYGCCTGG;
3a-for, CCAGGCRTNGGAGAATTCAT; 4a-bac, CTGCTGCTGCTTTGAARTCTG; and 4b-for, TACCTRSAAGCAGACTTCAAAG) [15]. Sequence alignments were done
using Clustal V [39], with some manual adjustments.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/92

were done using a successive approximations approach
[48]. Bootstrap branch support was estimated using
PAUP* 4.0b10 [44] based on 100 ML bootstrap replicates
under the same model and model parameters as were
used for phylogeny estimation, and Bayesian posterior
probability values were obtained using MrBayes 3.0 [49].
The resulting tree is used to illustrate the phylogenetic distribution of Stowaway elements and excision sites.

References
Short transposable elements were initially recognized as
highly variable insertions with conserved termini in some
β-amylase introns. The basic local alignment search tool
(BLAST) [40] yielded significant alignments to Stowaway
elements from barley, wheat, and/or rye in the Entrez
nucleotide database [41]. Each of the five β-amylase elements was used for a separate nucleotide-nucleotide
BLAST search of all organisms in Entrez, with low complexity filter on, and a word size of 11. BLAST searches can
recover high-score (low E-value) matches based solely on
short regions of high similarity (including Stowaway TIRs),
so searches were run twice; the TIR sequences were first
included with, and then excluded from, the query
sequences. The best matches in terms of length and
sequence identity were similar for both sets of searches,
and the results based on the full sequences are presented.
The β-amylase elements' secondary structures (not
shown) were predicted using mfold v. 3.2 [42] on the
Rensselaer bioinformatics web server [43].

Phylogenetic distribution of elements was assessed relative to the β-amylase gene tree, which was estimated after
exclusion of the Stowaway elements themselves. Details of
the sampling, analysis methods, and interpretation of the
resulting phylogenetic tree are provided elsewhere [15]. In
brief, aligned sequences were analyzed with PAUP*
4.0b10 [44] using maximum likelihood (ML) under a
general time reversible model of sequence evolution [45]
with some sites assumed to be invariable, and with rate
variation among the remaining sites assumed to follow a
gamma distribution [46,47]. Model parameter optimization, and tree searches using fixed optimized parameters,
