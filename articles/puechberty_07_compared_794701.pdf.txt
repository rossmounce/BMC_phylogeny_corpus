Abstract
Background: Trypanosomatids exhibit a unique gene organization into large directional gene
clusters (DGCs) in opposite directions. The transcription "strand switch region" (SSR) separating
the two large DGCs that constitute chromosome 1 of Leishmania major has been the subject of
several studies and speculations. Thus, it has been suspected of being the single replication origin
of the chromosome, the transcription initiation site for both DGCs or even a centromere. Here,
we have used an inter-species compared genomics approach on this locus in order to try to identify
conserved features or motifs indicative of a putative function.
Results: We isolated, and compared the structure and nucleotide sequence of, this SSR in 15
widely divergent species of Leishmania and Sauroleishmania. As regards its intrachromosomal
position, size and AT content, the general structure of this SSR appears extremely stable among
species, which is another demonstration of the remarkable structural stability of these genomes at
the evolutionary level. Sequence alignments showed several interesting features. Overall, only 30%
of nucleotide positions were conserved in the SSR among the 15 species, versus 74% and 62% in
the 5' parts of the adjacent XPP and PAXP genes, respectively. However, nucleotide divergences
were not distributed homogeneously along this sequence. Thus, a central fragment of
approximately 440 bp exhibited 54% of identity among the 15 species. This fragment actually
represents a new Leishmania-specific CDS of unknown function which had been overlooked since
the annotation of this chromosome. The encoded protein comprises two trans-membrane
domains and is classified in the "structural protein" GO category. We cloned this novel gene and
expressed it as a recombinant green fluorescent protein-fused version, which showed its
localisation to the endoplasmic reticulum. The whole of these data shorten the actual SSR to an
887-bp segment as compared with the original 1.6 kb. In the rest of the SSR, the percentage of
identity was much lower, around 22%. Interestingly, the 72-bp fragment where the putatively single
transcription initiation site of chromosome 1 was identified is located in a low-conservation portion

of the SSR and is itself highly polymorphic amongst species. Nevertheless, it is highly C-rich and
presents a unique poly(C) tract in the same position in all species.
Conclusion: This inter-specific comparative study, the first of its kind, (a) allowed to reveal a novel
genus-specific gene and (b) identified a conserved poly(C) tract in the otherwise highly polymorphic
region containing the putative transcription initiation site. This allows hypothesising an intervention
of poly(C)-binding proteins known elsewhere to be involved in transcriptional control.

Background
The protozoan parasite Leishmania sp. is responsible for
significant worldwide human morbidity and mortality,
and the clinical features of diseases vary depending on the
causative species. The genus Leishmania belongs to the
family of trypanosomatids with, among others, Trypanosoma brucei and T. cruzi, responsible for sleeping sickness
and Chagas' disease, respectively. Taxonomically, it is separated into two sub-genera:L. (Leishmania) and L. (Viannia). The differentiation between both appears very
ancient, as it is estimated to be contemporary to the formation of the Gondwana, i.e. around 60 million years [1].
However, comparative genomics showed the general
structure of the genome to be remarkably stable within
this genus. Chromosomal synteny groups are entirely conserved for all Old World species (subgenus L. (Leishmania)) where 36 heterologous chromosomes have been
identified [2]. As regards the New World, only two and
one large chromosomal rearrangements, according to the
subgenus, have been shown as compared with Old World
species. This leads to a chromosome number of 34 and 35
for L. (Leishmania) and L. (Viannia) species, respectively,
but with all Old World species linkage groups remaining
conserved [3]. Similarly, chromosomal restriction maps
showed a complete conservation of collinearity of markers between species [4]. Finally, the sequencing of the 'TriTryp' genomes also demonstrated a high degree of synteny
among those three protozoa (L. major, T. brucei and T.
cruzi) [5].
Trypanosomatids exhibit a number of highly original
molecular and cellular biological features. Among those,
one may cite systematic trans-splicing, consisting in the
addition of a 39 nt-spliced leader RNA at the 5'end of all
mRNAs, and the near absence of promoters for polymerase II, implying an absence of regulation of gene expression at the transcriptional level. One of the most
extraordinary features revealed by these genome projects
was the gene organisation into large collinear clusters
present on a single strand and comparable to prokaryotic
polycistronic units, except that the genes present have no
common nor akin function [6-8]. These large directional
gene clusters (DGCs) are separated by short sequences of
a few kbs termed coding strand switches or strand-switch
regions (SSRs), where the transcription sense converges or
diverges. This remarkable position led several authors to

express different hypotheses upon the putative function of
these regions in Leishmania.
The comparative in silico analysis of several SSRs in L.
major only revealed low homologies at the structural as
well as nucleotide sequence level [5,8,9] that render difficult a common interpretation as for their putative role. AT
distribution and hairpin content analysis failed revealing
common features to different SSRs but allowed separating
them into two groups with respect to the adjacent gene
clusters transcription orientation (divergent or convergent) [9]. The same authors showed that the five SSRs analysed presented a very high intrinsic DNA curvature, the
latter being classically associated with transcription as
well as replication and centromere functions (reviewed in
[7]).
However, experimental data showed that the deletion of
the sole SSR of chromosome 1 did not affect mitotic stability, hence it was not necessary for chromosomal replication nor segregation [10]. This goes against the
hypotheses of this SSR being a single replication origin
[11] or a centromere [9]. It is noteworthy that, whereas in
T. cruzi, a 16-kb SSR, made for a large part of retroelements, has been identified as a centromere [12], in Leishmania, the centromeric function on chromosome 1 could
be attributed to a subtelomeric 20-kb satellite repeat cluster [13]. On the other hand, run-on experiments showed
that this same SSR on L. major chromosome 1 contained
a single site of bi-directional initiation of transcription for
both gene clusters [14]. This might explain why the deletion of this SSR could not be realised on the three copies
of chromosome 1 in the reference strain L. major 'Friedlin'
[10]. On the other hand, the expression of a reporter gene
inserted into one of both gene clusters was not affected by
the deletion of the SSR [10], which shows that transcription is possible without the presence of the SSR. Myler et
al. explained the latter fact by a minor 'residual' level of
expression on the chromosome that would not initiate at
the SSR itself [14]: still, this level of transcription is sufficiently high to allow the expression of the reporter protein.
Here, we bring new elements in the knowledge of the
structure and conservation of these regions using an infrageneric compared genomics approach. We have

sequenced the SSR of chromosome 1 in 15 highly divergent species of Leishmania and Sauroleishmania (of which
the inclusion within Leishmania remains uncertain) [15]
and show the presence of conserved structural elements
and motifs that were overlooked during sequence annotation or using inter-genera comparative genomics.

Results and discussion
The general structure of the "switch region" is conserved in
all Leishmania species
We have analyzed the SSR of chromosome 1 in 15 species
of Leishmania and Sauroleishmania. In each species, this
region was amplified by using PCR primers located on the
5' part of the two genes adjacent to the SSR in L. major:
PAXP and XPP (Fig. 1). For all species, a fragment of
expected size (approximately 1650 bp) was found. This
fragment was cloned and sequenced [GenBank™ accession
numbers DQ522034 to DQ522048]: this confirmed the
presence of both genes adjacent to the SSR. As expected,
the transcription direction of both genes is in opposite
sense and directed towards the telomeres in all species.
The distance between the start codons of both genes is relatively constant as it lies between 1640 and 1669 bp (for
L. aethiopica and L. amazonensis respectively) (Table 1).
Incidentally, our data allow repositoning the start codon
of the PAXP gene at position 79049 instead of 79145. The
SSR is thus remarkably size-stable since it varies of <2%
among both extremes. These results support previous
studies on the conservation of chromosomal linkage
groups [2,3], or the compared mapping of certain chromosomes in various species [4], showing a surprising
interspecific conservation of the organization of these
genomes. As described in L. major [6], the AT content of
this sequence in the various species is relatively high since
it ranges between 50% (L. enriettii) and 54% (Sauroleishmania) (Table 1). This relative AT-richness distinguishes
the SSR from the remainder of the genome where it is 35%
[6]. This physical characteristic may facilitate weaker binding of the two strands during either transcription or replication processes, and is classically found in the noncoding regions with a structural role such as centromeres
or replication origins [16,17]. The whole of these features
shows that the general structure of this region is highly
conserved among the 15 species studied here.
Presence of a conserved CDS in the switch region
An alignment of the 15 sequences amplified as above was
realised using ClustalW software. Figure 2 represents the
rates of conserved nucleotides (nt) among the 15 species
studied, at the level of the SSR on the one hand, and of the
adjacent genes on the other hand. The 5' part of both
genes is highly conserved, with a mean identity rate
among all 15 species of 74% and 62% for XPP and PAXP
respectively (analysed on 97 and 109 bp, respectively);
most mutations being silent, this yields identity rates at

with the genomes of Trypanosoma brucei and T. cruzi, we

the amino acid level of 80 % and 78 % respectively. It
should be noted that the comparison of 100 bps from a
Leishmania gene generally yields divergence rates representative of those obtained when one compares the whole
length of the gene (see Legend of Fig. 2). At the level of the
SSR, the overall nt divergence appears much more significant: only 30% of nt positions are conserved among the
15 sequences. Interestingly, this divergence is not distributed homogeneously along this sequence. Thus, a central
fragment of approximately 440 bp (429 bp in L. major),
termed B, exhibits 54% of identity among the 15 species
(Table 1 and Fig. 2). It contrasts with most of the rest of
the SSR (except fragment D, see below) where this percentage is much lower, being 23% and 22% for fragment
A (left) and C (right), respectively. The quality of the
alignment of fragment B is actually close to that observed
in the 5' parts of the XPP and PAXP genes (Fig. 2). A closer
analysis revealed that it actually corresponds to an ORF
conserved in the whole of the species, hence to a CDS [see
Additional file 1: Amino acid sequence alignment], whose
transcription orientation would be towards the 'left' of the
chromosome. BLAST analysis did not show any valid
homology of this sequence to any other SSR not to any
other organism, in particular in the genomes of T. brucei

and T. cruzi. This CDS, with no putative function, was
recently added in the L. major GeneDB database.
Another moderately conserved fragment, termed D, was
also noted in the ca. 120 nucleotides upstream of the
PAXP gene (Fig. 2) in the SSR. Of note on this fragment is
the putative spliced leader RNA addition site (AG) for
PAXP [14] which is conserved in all 15 species. By contrast, it is noteworthy that the putative trans-splicing
acceptor site (SAS) of the XPP gene, that was identified in
the same report 840 bp upstream of the methionine
codon [14], is not conserved amongst all species (only in
9/15 species) and is now located 50 nt upstream of the
newly identified CDS, hence was probably misidentified.
The putative conserved SAS of the new CDS is likely
located 20 nt upstream of its start codon. The sequence
alignment allows the identification of only one candidate
SAS for the XPP gene that would be conserved amongst all
Leishmania species (but not Sauroleishmania), 50 nt
upstream (L. major sequence) of the start codon of XPP.
Analysis of the Leishmania-specific CDS
As it is is not conserved among the Tri-Tryps (L. major, T.
brucei and T. cruzi), this CDS therefore appears Leishmania-specific. As such, it constitutes one example of a species-specific gene occurring at a synteny breakpoint
between these three organisms, since the SSR analysed
here forms such a breakpoint [5]. In T. cruzi, this SSR is
conserved as such (1211 bp, with the XPP and PAXP gene
located on the 'left' and 'right' of the SSR respectively); but

another unknown CDS is located upstream of the PAXP
gene, hence at the start of the 'right-oriented' directional
gene cluster (DGC) (like our novel gene is located at the
start of the 'left-oriented' DGC in Leishmania). This CDS in
T. cruzi is conserved in the same location and DGC in T.
brucei, suggesting that our novel gene likely is the result of
both a gene deletion (that of the CDS of T. cruzi and T.
brucei) and a gene insertion (that of our novel CDS) events
during evolution. By contrast, the region is not conserved
as such in T. brucei, where it sizes 8286 bp, bears several
'unlikely' CDSs and retroelements and, more importantly,
does not actually constitute a SSR; still, it is flanked downstream by the same DGC as in the other Tri-Tryps and
upstream by the upstream DGC of L. major chromosome
1 but entirely inverted [5].
The function of this new gene is unknown (like>60 % of
the Leishmania genes). The Protfun program allowed predicting its putative function in either energy metabolism
or cell enveloppe, and classified it in the "structural protein" GO category. Further bioinformatic analysis showed
that the encoded 143 amino acid protein (in L. major)
comprises two transmembrane helices (residues 32–54
and 104–126; probablity = 0.99 using TMHMM and InterProScan software). As regards post-transcriptional
processing, a signal peptide was identified at the N-terminus (according to Signal-P); and two serine and one threonine are potential phosphorylation sites (according to
NetPhos). Finally, TargetP shows a strong prediction for a
mitochondrial localisation, but targeting signals are often

respectively (black bars). Two segments of the SSR appear highly conserved (B and D, hatched bars) as compared with other
segments (A and C, open bars). It is noteworthy that the comparison of 100 bps from a Leishmania gene generally yields divergence rates similar to those obtained when one compares the whole length of the gene : e.g. here, for PAXP, the identity rates
between the sequences from L. major and L. braziliensis are 83.5% for the whole gene (now available in GeneDB) and 85.7% for
the 109 bps analysed here. XPP, PAXP, IS as in Fig. 1.

non-conserved in Trypanosomatids [[18]; our unpublished data].
We then constructed an episomal vector expressing a
recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fused version of the protein after transfection in L. major, in order
to observe its subcellular localisation. Combined cell
staining wih Mitotracker showed that, in opposition with
the predictions of TargetP, the protein is not addressed to
the mitochondrion (Fig. 3). By contrast, it localises to a
subpellicular, cytoplasmic and perinuclear network, that
is clearly not overlapping the mitochondrion, most likely
the endoplasmic reticulum. This localisation is compatible with the presence of two transmembrane domains. It
is noteworthy that no phenotype (cell growth, cell cycle,
morphology) could be associated with the episomal overexpression of the protein (not shown).
The putative transcription initiation site is located in a
highly variable segment
Martinez-Calvillo et al. [14] identified a 73-bp segment
on the SSR as the putative transcription initiation site on

chromosome 1 (position 78453–78525). Fig. 4 presents
the inter-specific alignment of the nt sequences corresponding to this segment. Interestingly enough, this
sequence is located in the portion of the SSR with the
highest inter-specific nt divergence (IS in Fig. 2). Moreover, the sequence itself is highly polymorphic amongst the
various species (Fig. 4). However, this segment shows
notable conserved features in all species: (i) as noted previously in L. major [14], it has the highest GC rate (ca.
70%) in the whole SSR, and particularly is highly C-rich;
(ii) it presents a unique poly(C) tract conserved in the
same position, although of variable length, in all species,
including in highly divergent species like L. enriettii or
MAR1 (see below). The presence of this poly(C) tract was
not specifically mentioned in the corresponding paper
[14]. Although it may be considered as a simple polypyrimidine tract, it is the only conserved tract in the whole
segment, and this conserved feature makes it is tempting
to speculate upon its possible role. The high C-content
may here induce a conformation of the DNA double helix
supporting RNA polymerase entry. Moreover, poly(C)binding proteins, a conserved subfamily of K-homology

domain-containing proteins, are known, among other
functions, to be involved in transcriptional control
through a variety of mechanisms [19] and in particular to
activate transcription of the human c-myc gene [20].
The switch region sequences alignment yields a coherent
taxonomic tree
The phylogenetic tree built from these SSR sequences
clearly identified the various groups classically defined in
the genus Leishmania (Fig. 5) [15]. Thus, a very high level
of homology can be observed within groups that comprise classically very closely related species such as L.
major-L. arabica-L. turanica and L. peruviana-L. brasiliensis-

L. guyanensis, with 98.8% and 97.6% of identical nucleotide positions over the whole SSR, respectively. Between
these two groups, which may be taken as representatives
of the L. (Leishmania) and L. (Viannia) subgenera respectively, the percentage of identity is only 69%, supporting
the current taxonomic dichotomy. A homology rate of
83.7 % for this SSR had previously been reported among
L. major, L. donovani, L. infantum, L. mexicana and L. amazonensis [14]. Interestingly, two species are shown clearly
differentiated at the basis of the tree: L. sp. MAR1 and L.
enriettii. The first one corresponds to extremely rare isolates from cutaneous leishmaniasis patients from the Caribbean [21]. The second one is an animal species isolated

on rare occasions from the guinea-pig [22] and was found
as the most external member of the genus Leishmania [23].
Both species also clustered together at a basal position for
all other Euleishmania by molecular phylogeny using
DNA polymerase alpha and RNA polymerase II geneencoding sequences [15]. Finally, it is noteworthy that
these sequence alignments strongly support the inclusion
of Sauroleishmania (of which the taxonomic position
remains controversial; reviewed in [1]) within Leishmania
and perhaps in an intermediary position between both
subgenera.

Conclusion
This study is the first of its kind in Trypanosomatids as it
is based on an 'inter-specific' study (comparing 15 Leishmania species), as opposed to the vast analysis that had
been published in 2005 that compared the "Tri-Tryps", L.
major, T. brucei and T. cruzi [5]. The interest of the first
approach is to identify Leishmania-specific genes that
would have been overlooked in the second approach, e.g.
this new CDS. This is a novel demonstration of the interest of a (here infrageneric) compared genomics approach
in identifying unknown genes or functional motifs. The
presence of this CDS might partly explain the difficulties
encountered in knocking-out the SSR [10], if this endoplasmic reticulum-restricted Leishmania-specific gene had
an essential role.
Considering its transcription sense, these data also actually shortens the 'proper' strand switch region to an 877bp segment (segment C in Fig. 2, position 78173 to 79049
on L. major Friedlin chromosome 1).
This study also sheds new light upon the putative function
of the SSR of chromosome 1. Surprisingly indeed, the

putative transcription initiation site (TIS) previously identified on this chromosome by run-on analysis [14] is
found in the most polymorphic portion of the SSR; yet, it
presents a conserved poly(C) tract in a highly conserved
position in divergent Leishmania species. These data both
question and reinforce the TIS hypothesis. The high nt
sequence polymorphism of this segment and the ubiquitous presence of poly(C) tracts make it difficult to define
structural features of TISs in Leishmania. Conversely, the
fact that a number of genes encoding K-homology
domain-containing proteins have been identified within
the Leishmania genome make it possible to hypothesize
that these proteins participate in transcriptional control.
Experimental analysis of these genes may help in understanding transcription initation mechanisms used by this
unusual parasite.

Phylogenetic analysis of 15 divergent Leishmania species obtained from the chromosome 1 strand switch
region sequence alignment. Unrooted tree produced from the chromosome 1 strand switch region sequence alignment by
the DNAMP program in DAMBE (see text for comments). Names represent different Leishmania species (see Table 1).

Sauroleishmania, S. tarentolae LEM351 (RTAR/DZ/39/TARVI). All strains were cultivated on blood agar (NovyMcNeal-Nicolle) medium. Their identity was checked by
examination of 15 isoenzyme systems immediately prior
to this study [24].
PCR conditions and sequences
Genomic DNA extraction of each strain was performed by
phenol-chloroform, followed by ethanol precipitation.
All DNA regions analysed were PCR-amplified from total
genomic DNA using the high -fidelity Platinum® Pfx DNA
Polymerase (Invitrogen®). Different primers were used for
targeting different areas of the acidocalcisomal exopolyphosphatase (XPP) gene, the poly(A) export protein
(PAXP) gene and the central part of the SSR: forward primers ccgacaatgctgtccatgt and gtggcaatgcaaatgggcagc; and
reverse primers gcaactcccgtcccacga, and tgagcgcgcgacttgtcg. After electrophoresis, PCR products were purified

from agarose gels and cloned into pGEMT-Easy
(Promega®), then sequenced on a Licor® automated
sequencer and later assembled using the Sequencher™
software (Gene Codes Corp.®). All sequences were double
strand reads and the quality of the sequence obtained was
carefully checked manually.
Sequence analysis
Nucleotide sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees
were realised using ClustalW [25] and Dambe software
[26]. Homologies were searched via Blast on two distinct
websites [27,28]. Bioinformatic analysis of the protein
was done using CBS [29] and EBI [30] software resources.
Expression of the recombinant protein
The coding region of the novel CDS, with the start and
stop codons removed, was PCR-amplified from L.major
'Friedlin' genomic DNA with specific forward and reverse

oligonucleotides containing the MfeI and HpaI restriction
sites respectively. The PCR product, purified and digested
with MfeI-HpaI, was cloned into the MfeI and HpaI sites
of the plasmid vector pTH6nGFPc [18], generating a construct where the CDS is fused to the GFP gene in its 3' end.
100 µg of episomal DNA plasmid were then transfected by
electroporation into 8 × 107 L. major 'Friedlin' promastigotes grown to mid-log phase, which were grown under
selection pressure with hygromycin at 30 µg/ml. Leishmania cells were then viewed in microscopy and photographed as described [18]. The mitochondrion was
visualised by incubating cultures in MitoTracker Red
CMXRos (Molecular Probes®) for 10 min prior to fixation.
