Most of the 6.5% - 10% of human DNA bases
that are functional now will soon be turned over

Background
Despite the availability of an increasing number of
mammalian genome sequences, and the considerable
effort devoted to their analysis, two key questions still
provoke much debate. (i) What fraction of a genome
confers biological function, as opposed to the remaining
proportion that has had no biological effect and thus
has not been subject to selection? By careful scrutiny of
protein-coding gene models it has become clear that
approximately 1.06% of the human genome encodes
(functional) protein- coding sequence. An even larger
fraction of the genome has been inferred to contain
functional sequence but estimates of this fraction’s size
have proved particularly contentious. (ii) Do genomes of
different species contain different amounts of functional
sequence, and is this measure related to organismal
complexity? Similar numbers of protein-coding genes
among diverse species suggests the possibility that our
naive notion of complexity is fundamentally incorrect,
and that many species are comparably complex, in a
sense yet to be defined. Alternatively, it may be that
much of the apparent differences in complexity between
species are reflected by varying amounts of functional
non-coding sequence.

to coding constrained bases of ~ 2. This suggests that,
rather than genome size or protein-coding gene complement, it is the number of functional bases that might
best mirror our naïve preconceptions of organismal
complexity. Furthermore, we observe that as the divergence between mammalian species increases, the predicted amount of pairwise shared functional sequence
drops off dramatically, approximately halving in 90 million years of eutherian evolution.

Conclusion
These results provide strong evidence for the existence
of substantial amounts of functional and mostly noncoding nucleotides that are specific to sub-clades of
the mammalian phylogeny. Furthermore, mammalian
genomes are predicted to contain greater amounts of
putative functional bases than genomes of fish and
fruit flies.

Results
By applying Lunter’s Neutral Indel Model to genomes
drawn from pairs of diverse metazoans, we have been
able to estimate that between 200 and 300 Mb (~6.5 10%) of the human genome is under functional constraint; this includes 5-8 times as many constrained
non-coding bases than bases that encode proteins. By
contrast, in Drosophila melanogaster only 56-66 Mb
appear to be constrained, implying a ratio of non-coding
