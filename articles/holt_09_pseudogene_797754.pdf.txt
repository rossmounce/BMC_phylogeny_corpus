Abstract
Background: Of the > 2000 serovars of Salmonella enterica subspecies I, most cause self-limiting
gastrointestinal disease in a wide range of mammalian hosts. However, S. enterica serovars Typhi
and Paratyphi A are restricted to the human host and cause the similar systemic diseases typhoid
and paratyphoid fever. Genome sequence similarity between Paratyphi A and Typhi has been
attributed to convergent evolution via relatively recent recombination of a quarter of their
genomes. The accumulation of pseudogenes is a key feature of these and other host-adapted
pathogens, and overlapping pseudogene complements are evident in Paratyphi A and Typhi.
Results: We report the 4.5 Mbp genome of a clinical isolate of Paratyphi A, strain AKU_12601,
completely sequenced using capillary techniques and subsequently checked using Illumina/Solexa
resequencing. Comparison with the published genome of Paratyphi A ATCC9150 revealed the two are
collinear and highly similar, with 188 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 39 insertions/deletions. A
comparative analysis of pseudogene complements of these and two finished Typhi genomes (CT18,
Ty2) identified several pseudogenes that had been overlooked in prior genome annotations of one or
both serovars, and identified 66 pseudogenes shared between serovars. By determining whether each
shared and serovar-specific pseudogene had been recombined between Paratyphi A and Typhi, we
found evidence that most pseudogenes have accumulated after the recombination between serovars.
We also divided pseudogenes into relative-time groups: ancestral pseudogenes inherited from a
common ancestor, pseudogenes recombined between serovars which likely arose between initial
divergence and later recombination, serovar-specific pseudogenes arising after recombination but prior
to the last evolutionary bottlenecks in each population, and more recent strain-specific pseudogenes.
Conclusion: Recombination and pseudogene-formation have been important mechanisms of
genetic convergence between Paratyphi A and Typhi, with most pseudogenes arising independently

after extensive recombination between the serovars. The recombination events, along with
divergence of and within each serovar, provide a relative time scale for pseudogene-forming
mutations, affording rare insights into the progression of functional gene loss associated with host
adaptation in Salmonella.

Background
Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A
(Typhi, Paratyphi A) are human-restricted bacterial
pathogens that cause related systemic diseases, known
as typhoid, paratyphoid or enteric fever [1]. Together,
these pathogens infect more than 25 million people
annually worldwide, resulting in > 200,000 deaths [2].
Historically, Paratyphi A was responsible for less than
20% of these infections [2], however Paratyphi A
infection rates have been rising, particularly in South
East Asia where this serovar is now responsible for 30–
50% of enteric fever cases [3-6]. This increase has been
associated with rises in antibiotic resistance among
paratyphoid infections [3, 7, 8]. It may also be associated
with vaccination against Typhi, which unfortunately
provides little cross-protection against Paratyphi A [9,
10]. Finished genomic sequence is currently available for
two Typhi isolates (recent clinical isolate CT18 and
laboratory strain Ty2) and one Paratyphi A isolate
(laboratory strain ATCC9150) [11-13].
Typhi and Paratyphi A are unusual among S. enterica, as
most serovars infect a broad range of host species and
cause self-limiting gastroenteritis, while Typhi and
Paratyphi A infect only humans and cause systemic
disease [14]. The basis for their unusual shared
phenotype is unclear. Whole-genome sequence comparisons suggest that the Paratyphi A and Typhi chromosomes are much more closely related at the DNA level
than other S. enterica serovars. Furthermore the genomes
of both organisms harbour a large number of pseudogenes (> 4% of coding sequences in each genome)
[11-13] compared to host-generalist relatives such as
S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (0.9%) or E. coli K12
(0.7%).
A recent study showed that the apparent similarity
between Paratyphi A and Typhi genome sequences is
due to low nucleotide divergence (mean 0.18%) across a
quarter of the genome, while the rest of the genome
sequences are as divergent as any other pair of S. enterica
serovars (mean 1.2%) [15]. The study used model-based
approaches to demonstrate that this is due to relatively
recent convergence via recombination between 23% of
the Paratyphi A and Typhi genomes, whose initial
divergence occurred around the same time as that of
other S. enterica serovars. It is possible that this extensive
recombination was responsible for the convergence of

Paratyphi A and Typhi on a human-restricted lifestyle,
however it is also plausible that the serovars followed
independent paths to host-restriction and the opportunity for recombination arose after they became isolated
together in this shared niche. The direction of recombination cannot be determined, and may have been uni- or
bi-directional.
Pseudogenes are coding sequences (CDS) that are putatively inactivated by mutations including nonsense
substitutions, frameshifts, or truncation by deletion or
rearrangement. Loss of gene function through pseudogene
formation and gene deletion appears to be a hallmark of
host-restricted pathogenic bacteria compared to their hostgeneralist relatives [11, 13, 16-19]. This is likely due to a
combination of adaptation (whereby loss of gene function
is selected for in the new host) and genetic drift associated
with population bottlenecks during or following adaptation to the new niche. It has been reported that Paratyphi
A and Typhi share some of their pseudogenes [13],
resulting in convergent loss of gene functions which may
be associated with adaptation to their shared niche. The
genomes of S. enterica encode two type III secretion systems
(TTSS), which mediate secretion of a range of effector
proteins into host cells [20]. Many of these effectors are
encoded in Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI-1
and SPI-2, reviewed in [20, 21]), including several that are
pseudogenes in Typhi and/or Paratyphi A. The inactivation
of these and other genes involved in interactions between
Salmonella and host is thought to play a key role in the host
adaptation of these serovars [11, 13].
Here we report the 4.5 Mbp genome sequence of a recent
clinical isolate of Paratyphi A, strain AKU_12601, allowing
the first comparative analysis between two Paratyphi A
isolates at the whole-genome sequence level. We also
present a novel comparative annotation of pseudogenes in
all four Paratyphi A and Typhi genomes. This is combined
with previously reported divergence data [15] in order to
tease apart the roles that recombination and pseudogene
formation have played in the genetic and phenotypic
convergence of Paratyphi A and Typhi.

Results and Discussion
Sequencing the Paratyphi A AKU_12601 genome
The whole genome sequence of Paratyphi A strain
AKU_12601 was assembled, finished and annotated as

described in the Methods section. The genome consists of a
4,581,797 bp circular chromosome, encoding 4,285 CDS,
and a 212,711 bp IncHI1 multidrug resistance plasmid
pAKU_1 [EMBL:AM412236] which has been described in
detail elsewhere [22]. The AKU_12601 genome was also
resequenced using the Illumina Genome Analyzer (Illumina), to a depth of 20-fold coverage. Short reads (35 bp)
generated by resequencing were aligned to the finished
sequence, which identified five high quality single base
discrepancies between the assemblies (see Methods). One
was found to be an erroneous base call in the finished
sequence following checking of trace files and was
corrected prior to EMBL submission. The remaining four
bases (6-, 8-, 10-, and 20-fold read depth in Illumina data)
may be errors in the Illumina resequencing, or reflect
genuine mutations arising during culturing in the
laboratory.
Data accessions
The finished sequence and annotation of the AKU_12601
genome is available in EMBL under accession FM200053,
and the Illumina resequencing data is available under
accession ERA000012 ftp://ftp.era.ebi.ac.uk/.
Comparison of Paratyphi A strains
AKU_12601 and ATCC9150
Comparative analysis revealed the two Paratyphi A
genomes to be collinear, with no rearrangements and no
acquisitions of phage or other large mobile elements. In
contrast, Typhi Ty2 contains an inversion of half the
genome between two rRNA operons and large-scale phage
variation compared to Typhi CT18 [12]. Several insertion/
deletion events and substitutions were identified between
the Paratyphi A genomes.
Insertions and deletions
A total of 39 insertion/deletion events, including
13 differences in homopolymeric tracts, were identified
between AKU_12601 and ATCC9150 (Table 1). Two
IS10 elements were inserted in AKU_12601, within the
nmpC gene and a hypothetical pseudogene (SSPA4008a/
SPA4318). Six variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs)
were identified, including one less tandem copy each of
the tRNA-Gly and rrT RNA genes in AKU_12601.

The largest single locus difference between the two
genomes occurs within the O-antigen biosynthetic
cluster rfb, where a 2.7 kb sequence including the 3'
end of putative O-antigen transporter rfbX (SSPA0733)
and two putative glycosyltransferase genes (rfbV/
SSPA0734 and 5' end of rfbU/SSPA0735) is present in
three tandem copies in ATCC9150. A single copy of this
sequence is present in other S. enterica serovars [23],
therefore the AKU_12601 sequence is assumed to be the

copies of a chimeric coding sequence, combining the 5'
end of rfbU with the 3' end of rfbX (Figure 1). These
genes are involved in synthesis and transport of
O-antigen [23], but it is unclear whether the increased
copy number and chimeric sequences generated by these
repeats cause any functional differences in O-antigen
expression between ATCC9150 and AKU_12601.

ATCC9150. Smaller VNTRs were identified within pduP
and rcnA, resulting in repeats of two and four amino acids
respectively in the encoded proteins. VNTRs are useful as
genetic markers for typing Salmonella enterica serovars, and
variability in the rcnA VNTR among Paratyphi A isolates
has been reported previously [24].
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
In addition to insertion/deletion events, 188 SNPs were
identified. These include 101 non-synonymous and 51
synonymous SNPs, giving a dN/dS ratio of 0.62, similar
to that observed between diverse Typhi strains [25].
While extreme care must be taken in interpreting dN/dS
ratios based on the comparison of two closely related
genomes [26], this ratio is consistent with some degree
of purifying selection in the Paratyphi A population.
Differences in pseudogene complements
The Paratyphi A AKU_12601 genome contains 204
pseudogenes, constituting 4.8% of annotated CDSs.
Although our comparative analysis revealed very few
sequence differences between the two Paratyphi A
genomes (188 SNPs, 39 insertion/deletion events),
these differences include 22 pseudogene-forming mutations (see Table 2). The mutations include six nonsense
SNPs and 16 insertion/deletion events, and were verified
by inspecting the capillary sequencing traces and
Illumina reads data for Paratyphi A AKU_12601. This
suggests that pseudogene-forming mutations are continuing to accumulate in Paratyphi A, as has been
observed in Typhi [12, 25].
Comparison of pseudogenes in
Paratyphi A and Typhi genomes
In order to comprehensively investigate the mechanisms
of convergent gene loss in Paratyphi A and Typhi, we

assembled a comparative table of pseudogenes present
in each serovar (Additional file 1). This analysis includes
all previously annotated pseudogenes, some additional
Typhi pseudogenes suggested previously [13] and some
novel pseudogenes identified by manually inspecting
Typhi and Paratyphi A sequences for all genes annotated
as pseudogenes in any of the AKU_12601, ATCC9150,
CT18 or Ty2 genomes (see Methods).
Shared pseudogenes
The resulting table includes 66 pseudogenes common
to Typhi (strains CT18, Ty2) and Paratyphi A (strains
AKU_12601, ATCC9150) (Additional file 1). This is
almost double the figure reported previously [13],
although many of the additional pseudogenes are
remnants of transposase or bacteriophage genes. By
aligning the Typhi and Paratyphi A DNA sequences for
the shared pseudogenes, we identified shared and
independent inactivating mutations (Additional file 1).
Contrary to previous reports [13], we found common
inactivating mutations in many of the shared
pseudogenes.

The functions of most of the shared pseudogenes was
discussed by the authors of the ATCC9150 genome study
[13] and need not be repeated here. Of particular note,
however, 20 of the shared pseudogenes (54% of nonphage/transposase shared pseudogenes) encode secreted
or surface-exposed proteins (Table 3), thus are likely to
have contributed to convergence upon similar patterns
of host interactions. Furthermore, inactivation of different genes in the same pathway will often result in similar
loss of function, thus the true contribution of pseudogene formation to phenotypic convergence between
Typhi and Paratyphi A is likely underestimated by
considering only shared pseudogenes. For example,
different members of the cbi cluster are inactivated in
Typhi and Paratyphi A, which may result in similar
inactivation of the cobalamin synthesis pathway [13].
Were pseudogenes shared by recombination?
Recombination has clearly been an important mechanism of convergence between Paratyphi A and Typhi [15].
The accumulation of pseudogenes is a convergent
trait evident in these genomes, and shared patterns of
pseudogene formation is a likely mechanism for
phenotypic convergence. But did recombination contribute to the sharing of pseudogenes?

More than 30% of the pseudogene complements of
Typhi and Paratyphi A were shared (Additional file 1),
consistent with the possibility that recombination of
23% of the genomes resulted in direct sharing of many
of their pseudogenes. We determined whether each

pseudogene lay in regions that were predicted to have
undergone relatively recent recombination between
Paratyphi A and Typhi (sequence divergence < 0.3%
between serovars according to [15]) (see Additional file
1). Of all the pseudogenes present in both Paratyphi
A AKU_12601 and ATCC9150, 24.3% lie in recently
recombined regions; of the pseudogenes present in both
Typhi CT18 and Ty2, 25.0% lie in recombined regions.
According to [15], 25.6% of genes in CT18 lie in the
recently recombined regions.
These observations are consistent with two scenarios,
illustrated in Figure 2: (1) most pseudogenes were
inactivated prior to recombination, and recombination
was random with respect to the location of pseudogenes
(Figure 2b); or (2) most pseudogenes were inactivated
after recombination, and these pseudogene-forming
mutations were random with respect to recombined
regions (Figure 2c). If (1) were true, we would expect
that (i) genes that are pseudogenes in one serovar but
intact in the other (i.e. serovar-specific pseudogenes)
would not lie in recombined regions, and (ii) most
pseudogenes in recombined regions would have been
shared during recombination, i.e. they would be
pseudogenes in both Paratyphi A and Typhi and share
common inactivating mutations in both genomes (red
circles in Figure 2b). If (2) were true, we would expect
that (i) serovar-specific pseudogenes would be distributed randomly with respect to recombined and nonrecombined regions, and (ii) very few pseudogenes

would have been shared during recombination, i.e.
very few pseudogenes in recombined regions would
share inactivating mutations (red circles in Figure 2c).
The distribution of serovar-specific and shared pseudogenes in recombined and nonrecombined regions is
shown in Figure 2a and summarised in Table 4. Pearson
c2 tests for each serovar based on this data give nonsignificant results (p - value > 0.2, Table 4), thus there is
no evidence of association between shared or serovarspecific pseudogenes and regions of recombination,
consistent with scenario (2). More than 20% of
serovar-specific pseudogenes lie in recombined regions
of each genome (Figure 2a, black lines in inner ring),
consistent with scenario (2) whereby serovar-specific
pseudogenes are expected to be randomly distributed
in the genome of which 23% has been recombined
(Figure 2c, black lines in inner ring). These observations
are extremely unlikely under scenario (1), which would
predict recombination to result in shared but not
serovar-specific pseudogenes being present in recombined regions (Figure 2b, inner ring).
We found only 18 pseudogenes in recombined regions
harboured the same inactivating mutations (red lines
and circles in inner rings, Figure 2a), less than 20% of
pseudogenes in the recombined regions of each genome
(Additional file 1). As illustrated in Figure 2, this is
consistent with scenario (2) but not scenario (1), which
would predict that most pseudogenes lying in

recombined regions would be shared by virtue of
recombination and therefore carry the same inactivating
mutations (red circles in Figure 2).
The patterns of pseudogene distribution we observe
therefore suggest that the majority of pseudogenes
present in the extant genomes of Paratyphi A and Typhi
accumulated after the recombination of 23% of their
genomes. Whether this relationship is causal though,
remains to be proven. The acceleration of pseudogene

formation is most likely due to a combination of hostadaptation and genetic drift associated with a population
bottleneck in the new human-restricted niche. However
whether the extensive recombination between Typhi
and Paratyphi A resulted in, or resulted from, humanrestriction of the two organisms, is unknown. It is
plausible that host-restriction occurred independently in
Typhi and Paratyphi A, providing both (a) an opportunity
for recombination soon after they became isolated
together in this shared niche, and (b) a trigger for

the recombination shown is uni-directional, but bidirectional exchange would result in similar patterns. (b)

accelerated pseudogene formation. Alternatively, a
chance recombination event may have led to hostrestriction of both organisms. It has been noted that
recombination between Paratyphi A and Typhi involved
sharing of intact serovar-specific or rare genes, resulting in

many more shared rare genes than would be expected
otherwise [15] and presumably promoting the sharing of
novel functions. It is plausible therefore that recombination between Paratyphi A and Typhi led to a combination
of gene acquisition and loss-of-function resulting in
restriction to the human host, bestowing upon these
serovars a unique and novel genetic profile that contributed to host restriction and the ability to cause
systemic infection. Such an event would likely set
Paratyphi A and Typhi on a similar trajectory of host
adaptation and associated population bottlenecks, which
might account for their similar profiles of rapid accumulation of pseudogenes through adaptive selection and
genetic drift.
Tracing pseudogene formation in the evolutionary
histories of Paratyphi A and Typhi
The recombination described between Paratyphi A and
Typhi provides a rare marker of relative time in the
evolutionary histories of these organisms. The recombination was discovered by analysing the distribution of
nucleotide divergence levels between different regions of
the two genomes, which clearly identified a distinct
sub-population of low divergence corresponding to the
recombined regions (mean 0.18% compared to genome
average of 1.2%) [15]. Although not providing a precise
measure of age, this suggests that the recombination
event happened approximately 15% (0.18/1.2 = 0.15) as
long ago as the initial divergence of Paratyphi A, Typhi
and other S. enterica serovars. This implies that recombination occurred well before the most recent common
ancestors of each serovar (see Figure 3), and thus prior to
the last population bottlenecks in the Paratyphi A and
Typhi populations.

We divided the pseudogenes into distinct categories with
different relative ages (Additional file 1): (i) ancestral
pseudogenes (shared pseudogenes inactivated prior to
the divergence of Paratyphi A and Typhi), (ii) recombined pseudogenes (shared pseudogenes in recombined
regions, with shared inactivating mutations assumed to
have arisen after initial divergence), (iii) recent conserved pseudogenes (including serovar-specific pseudogenes, and shared pseudogenes containing different
inactivating mutations in Paratyphi A and Typhi; the
majority of these are expected to have become pseudogenes after recombination) and (iv) recent strain-specific
pseudogenes (pseudogenes in some but not all strains
belonging to their respective serovar). Table 3 summarises the shared pseudogenes in each category
(excluding ancestral transposase/phage gene remants)
and Figure 3 shows their approximate timing overlaid on
a phylogenetic tree of S. enterica serovars. Note that some
serovar-specific pseudogenes (group iii) will likely be

shown to be strain-specific (group iv) as more strains are
sequenced (see below).
Ancestral pseudogenes
The inactivating mutations in group (i) pseudogenes are
assumed to have been inherited by Paratyphi A and Typhi
from a common ancestor (Figure 3). Alternatively some
may have been exchanged between Paratyphi A and Typhi
soon after their divergence from other S. enterica. Either
way, these pseudogenes were among the earliest to arise in
the evolutionary history of Paratyphi A and Typhi, thus
their inactivation has been well tolerated in these serovars
(most have also accumulated secondary mutations). This is

Typhimurium SL1344

unsurprising for the majority of ancestral pseudogenes
which are insertion sequence (IS) transposase and phage
genes/fragments. However the inactivation of seven genes
known to be functional in Typhimurium and other
Salmonella, in particular those that are secreted or surface
exposed (Table 3), is likely to have had significant
functional impact including potential modulations of
host interactions. It is also possible that the loss of these
genes had little effect on the pathogenic potential of
Paratyphi A and Typhi and that they had classic S. enterica
host-generalist lifestyles until much later on. However the
best described of these seven co-inherited pseudogenes is
the secreted effector protein sopD2, which in Typhimurium
is involved in host interactions and virulence [27] and
therefore constitutes a plausible candidate for an early
modulator of host interactions in Paratyphi A and Typhi.

[15], rooted using S. bongori and E. coli as outgroups. Scale
bar is nucleotide divergence. The timing of the
recombination between Paratyphi A and Typhi is an
approximation inferred from published divergence data [15].
Group (i) pseudogenes were inactivated prior to the
divergence of Paratyphi A and Typhi, some are also
inactivated in Typhimurium and Paratyphi B; following their
divergence Paratyphi A and Typhi likely accumulated few
additional pseudogenes; during the recombination of 23% of
their genomes (direction of transfer unknown) 18
pseudogene sequences were shared between Paratyphi A
and Typhi, including five non-ancestral pseudogenes (group
ii); many pseudogenes were formed during a period of
accelerated pseudogene accumulation in both serovars,
including most group (iii) pseudogenes; pseudogenes
continue to accumulate in individual sub-lineages after the
most recent common ancestor of each serovar (group iv).

Pseudogenes shared by recombination
Group (ii) contains five recombined pseudogenes (Table 3),
which display 0.14–0.25% nucleotide divergence between
the two serovars compared to a genome average of 1.2% and
thus were likely exchanged long after the initial divergence
of Paratyphi A and Typhi (Figure 3). One of these encodes
an IS transposase, leaving four candidates for convergence
via shared gene inactivation directly attributable to recombination. These include the secreted effector protein sopA,
which mimics mammalian ubiquitin ligase and is recognized and degraded by the human ubiquitination pathway
[28]. It is necessary for virulence in both murine systemic
infections and bovine gastrointestinal infections by Typhimurium [29, 30], thus is clearly important for interactions
between Salmonella and mammalian hosts. The loss of this
gene in Paratyphi A and Typhi may therefore have been an
important factor in the restriction or adaptation of these
serovars to the human systemic niche. SopA is also a
pseudogene in the sequenced Paratyphi B strain SPB7
[EMBL:CP000886], although this is difficult to interpret as it
is unclear whether this strain is of the systemic or enteric
pathotype (negative for tartrate fermentation, but also sopEnegative using PCR described in [31]). The other genes are
putative uncharacterised SPI-3 protein sugR, and two genes
not annotated previously in the ATCC9150 genome –
putative secreted protein SSPA0097 (interrupted by IS200
insertion) and putative L-asparaginase protein SSPA3228
(truncated at both ends by deletions).

Recent pseudogenes: convergence after recombination
In addition to > 100 pseudogenes specific to each serovar,
group (iii) includes 22 shared pseudogenes containing
different inactivating mutations in Paratyphi A and Typhi
(Table 3). While it is possible that some of those lying
outside recombined regions may have been present prior
to recombination, we propose that most of these mutations arose in the period of rapid pseudogene accumulation after recombination. These pseudogenes are examples
of convergent gene loss through independent mutation,
and are therefore good candidates for involvement in
adaptation to the human host. They include only one
transposase gene, the remainder being genes of known or
putative function, many of which have been implicated in
host interactions in serovar Typhimurium (e.g. fhuA, fhuE,
shdA, ratB, sivH) [13, 32]. Two of the independently
acquired pseudogenes, both members of fimbrial clusters
lying in Salmonella pathogenicity islands (safE in SPI-6, sefD
in SPI-10), were not identified in previous pseudogene
comparisons [13].

It is not possible to distinguish whether there has been
adaptive selection against the activity of these genes in
Paratyphi A and Typhi, or simply shared tolerance for
their inactivation. For example, it has been noted [13]
that three of these genes (shdA, ratB and sivH, part of the
25 kbp pathogenicity island CS54 [32]) are involved in
intestinal colonization and persistence, which does not
occur in typhoid or paratyphoid infection. However we
cannot distinguish whether the independent inactivation
of these genes in each serovar is due to selection against
colonization of the intestine (which may stimulate
host immune responses), or genetic drift since intestinal
colonization is not required to sustain a systemic
infection.

Ongoing accumulation of strain-specific pseudogenes
A recent comparative analysis of whole-genome variation in 19 Typhi strains inferred that their last common
ancestor harboured only 180 pseudogenes, while individual isolates had each accumulated at least 10–28
additional pseudogenes since their divergence from
that ancestor [25]. The number was predicted to be an
underestimate, as it did not take into account pseudogene formation via insertion/deletion of one or two
nucleotides which would introduce frameshifts. In our
comparison of the AKU_12601 and ATCC9150 genomes
we found 22 mutations resulting in strain-specific
pseudogene formation (10–12 per strain, Table 2), and
we predict that future comparative analyses of additional
strains will uncover further examples of recently acquired
strain-specific pseudogenes. These strain-specific pseudogenes must have arisen since the most recent common
ancestors of the respective Paratyphi A and Typhi

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/36

populations and are therefore more recent than those
that are conserved within the serovars (see Figure 3). It is
interesting to note that three genes were identified with
strain-specific mutations in one serovar and independent
mutations in the other serovar (see Additional file 1).
This may provide the opportunity for ongoing convergence between sub-lineages of the Typhi and Paratyphi
A populations as each serovar continues to evolve and
adapt.

Conclusion
The Paratyphi A AKU_12601 genome sequence presented here allowed the first whole-genome comparison
between Paratyphi A strains. By comparing the annotation of pseudogenes in these Paratyphi A genomes and
the two finished Typhi genomes CT18 and Ty2, we were
able to identify novel examples of pseudogenes that are
shared between these human-adapted serovars. Paratyphi A and Typhi have each undergone a parallel, rapid
accumulation of pseudogenes after extensive recombination of their genomes.
Although Paratyphi A and Typhi share 27 pseudogenes
over and above those inherited in inactive form from a
common ancestor, only five were shared via recombination while 22 are the result of more recent convergence
through independent adaptive mutation. Therefore
recombination and pseudogene formation have played
largely independent roles in the genetic convergence of
Paratyphi A and Typhi.
The recombination between Paratyphi A and Typhi
enabled us to identify different groups of pseudogenes
that have arisen in these genomes at different points in
their evolutionary histories. This implicates loss-offunction of a few genes in early restriction to the
human host (ancestral pseudogenes including sopD2)
and some in subsequent convergent adaptation to the
new niche (conserved and in particular shared conserved
pseudogenes including shdA, ratB, sivH). Pseudogenes
shared by recombination (e.g. sopA) may have contributed to host-restriction or host-adaptation.
While the analysis presented here considers only Paratyphi A and Typhi, there are other examples of humanadapted S. enterica serovars, including Sendai, Paratyphi
C and the systemic pathovar of Paratyphi B. It can be
expected that as genome sequences for these become
available, comparative analysis may yield further
insights into their mechanisms of host adaptation.
However the occurrence of relatively recent recombination between Paratyphi A and Typhi has afforded a
unique insight into the order of events and mechanisms
involved in their convergent evolution, a scenario which

has likely been played out in many other host-adapted
bacteria.

alignments were used to determine whether the same or
independent inactivating mutation(s) were present in
the different serovars.

Methods
Sequencing of AKU_12601
Paratyphi A strain AKU_12601 was isolated from a
Pakistani paratyphoid patient in Karachi, Pakistan in
2002. The whole-genome shotgun consisted of 83,857
paired-end reads from libraries of 2 to 2.8 kb in pUC19,
5 to 6 kb in pMAQ1, and 6 to 9 kb in pMAQ1, giving
9.8-fold coverage. A scaffold was produced using 1,180
paired-end reads from a 20- to 30-kb library in
pBACe3.6. The whole genome sequence was finished to
standard criteria [33], using 9,879 directed sequencing
reads. The sequence was annotated, and the annotation
was manually curated using Artemis software [34] as
previously described [33]. The sequence includes both
the chromosome, presented here, and the 212,711 bp
IncHI1 multidrug resistance plasmid pAKU_1 which has
been described in detail elsewhere [22]. AKU_12601 was
also resequenced using the Illumina Genome Analyzer
(Illumina), with 3,191,127 single-end 35 bp reads
providing 21.9-fold coverage of the chromosome.
Sequence comparisons
Maq [35] was used to map Illumina/Solexa 35 bp reads
to the finished AKU_12601 sequence and identify
potential errors (reported as SNPs by Maq using default
parameters). Capillary traces were manually inspected
for the five loci at which SNPs were reported by Maq
with consensus base quality > 20 and read depth > 5.

Pairwise whole-genome sequence comparisons were
generated with blastn and visualized using ACT [36].
Insertions, deletions and nucleotide substitutions
between the collinear Paratyphi A AKU_12601 and
ATCC9150 genomes were identified using diffseq
(EMBOSS [37]).
Comparison and annotation of pseudogenes
In order to compare annotated genomes of Paratyphi A
AKU_12601 [EMBL:FM200053] and ATCC9150 [EMBL:
CP000026], Typhi CT18 [EMBL:AL513382] and Ty2
[EMBL:AE014613] with Typhimurium LT2 [EMBL:
AE006468], pairwise whole-genome sequence comparisons were generated with blastn and visualized using
ACT [36]. Every gene annotated as a pseudogene in any
Typhi or Paratyphi A genome was manually inspected in
all five genomes, and its pseudogene status in each
genome reassessed. All pseudogenes identified in this
way are present in the AKU_12601 genome annotation,
although many such genes are not annotated in all of
ATCC9150, CT18 and Ty2. For coding sequences found
to be a pseudogene in more than one serovar, multiple

Data simulation
An initial set of 40 genes were selected at random to
represent ancestral pseudogenes. Additional sets of 20
and 150 genes were selected at random for each of two
serovars, to represent pseudogenes that accumulated
after initial divergence of the serovars (sampling with
replacement). The same random sets of pseudogenes
were used to simulate both scenarios, with only the
timing varying (set of 150 pseudogenes arising before or
after recombination). To simulate uni-directional recombination events depicted in Figure 2, serovar 2 pseudogenes lying in recombined regions were replaced with
serovar 1 pseudogenes lying in recombined regions. All
genes were selected at random from 4600 annotated in
Typhi CT18, and their status as recombined or nonrecombined was taken directly from the table of Typhi
genes provided in [15].
Phylogenetic analysis
Nucleotide sequences for genes that have not undergone
recent recombination between Typhi and Paratyphi A
(according to the table provided in [15]) were extracted
from the CT18 genome sequence using Artemis. Homologous sequences in other genomes were identified using
blastn, top scoring gapped sequence alignments for each
genome were assembled into a single multiple alignment
for each gene using Mview [38], which were then
concatenated. The analysis included Typhimurium
(strains LT2, SL1344) and S. enterica serovar Paratyphi
B SPB7 [EMBL:CP000886], S. bongori and E. coli K12
[EMBL:U00096] were included as outgroups to root the
tree. The S. bongori and Typhimurium SL1344 sequences
are available from the Wellcome Trust Sanger Insitute
[39]. MrBayes [40] was used to fit a phylogenetic model
to the concatenated multiple alignment of all (nonrecombined) genes (GRT+Γ model, 200,000 iterations),
Figure 3 shows the consensus tree.
