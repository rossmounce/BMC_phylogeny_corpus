A late origin of the extant eukaryotic diversity:
divergence time estimates using rare genomic
changes

Abstract
Background: Accurate estimation of the divergence time of the extant eukaryotes is a fundamentally important
but extremely difficult problem owing primarily to gross violations of the molecular clock at long evolutionary
distances and the lack of appropriate calibration points close to the date of interest. These difficulties are intrinsic
to the dating of ancient divergence events and are reflected in the large discrepancies between estimates
obtained with different approaches. Estimates of the age of Last Eukaryotic Common Ancestor (LECA) vary
approximately twofold, from ~1,100 million years ago (Mya) to ~2,300 Mya.
Results: We applied the genome-wide analysis of rare genomic changes associated with conserved amino acids
(RGC_CAs) and used several independent techniques to obtain date estimates for the divergence of the major
lineages of eukaryotes with calibration intervals for insects, land plants and vertebrates. The results suggest an early
divergence of monocot and dicot plants, approximately 340 Mya, raising the possibility of plant-insect coevolution.
The divergence of bilaterian animal phyla is estimated at ~400-700 Mya, a range of dates that is consistent with
cladogenesis immediately preceding the Cambrian explosion. The origin of opisthokonts (the supergroup of
eukaryotes that includes metazoa and fungi) is estimated at ~700-1,000 Mya, and the age of LECA at ~1,000-1,300
Mya. We separately analyzed the red algal calibration interval which is based on single fossil. This analysis produced
time estimates that were systematically older compared to the other estimates. Nevertheless, the majority of the
estimates for the age of the LECA using the red algal data fell within the 1,200-1,400 Mya interval.
Conclusion: The inference of a “young LECA” is compatible with the latest of previously estimated dates and has
substantial biological implications. If these estimates are valid, the approximately 1 to 1.4 billion years of evolution
of eukaryotes that is open to comparative-genomic study probably was preceded by hundreds of millions years of
evolution that might have included extinct diversity inaccessible to comparative approaches.

Background
Estimation of divergence dates for biological taxa from
molecular data is a perilous exercise fraught by artifacts
which become progressively more severe for events
further in the past [1,2]. There are many factors that
hamper molecular time estimates, especially for ancient

events. Some of the most important problems are violations of the molecular clock, uncertainty in tree topology and branch length estimates, and the paucity and
inaccuracy of fossil-based calibration points [2-4]. However, all these difficulties notwithstanding, knowing the
dates of the major events in the evolution of life as precisely as possible is indispensable to connect biological
evolution with the data of geochemistry and geology,
and so to reconstruct the history of life on earth.

Arguably, dating is particularly important and interesting when it comes to the earliest divergence events in
the evolution of eukaryotes. The deep phylogeny of
eukaryotes is an extremely difficult and controversial
problem. The concept of eukaryotic phylogeny that
comes closest to being the current consensus maintains
that there are 5 or, possibly, 6 distinct major branches,
or supergroups, in the eukaryotic domain of cellular life,
namely, unikonts (an assemblage that includes opishtokonts (metazoa, fungi, and related protists, and amoebozoa, with the latter considered a distinct supergroup in
some studies), plantae, chromalveolata, excavates, and
rhizaria [5-8]. Regardless of the exact status and composition of each individual supergroup, it appears that several major branches of eukaryotes diverged in a “Big
Bang-type” event, whereby the internal branches in the
tree are extremely short, so much so that the “true” tree
topology might be undecipherable [9-11] given the
intrinsic problems of deep phylogenetic reconstruction
[2,12]. Although several attempts have been made to
resolve the deepest eukaryotic branching by bringing
some of the supergroups together into “megagroups”
and rooting the tree [13-18], the relationships between
the supergroups currently cannot be considered
resolved, and the prospects for a conclusive solution are
uncertain.
If the supergroups of eukaryotes indeed diverged in a
rapid succession during an explosive phase of evolution,
the problem of estimating the age of the Last Eukaryotic
Common Ancestor (LECA) assumes a special importance. An accurate determination of this key date would
be essential for tying the primary radiation of eukaryotes
to specific events in the geological record and possibly
identifying the factor(s) that triggered the rapid
radiation.
The published time estimates for the divergence of
eukaryotic taxa based on protein sequence analysis vary
widely even for relatively recent evolutionary events due
to the uncertainty of the fossil record, substantial rate
variation and other problems of molecular dating
[1,2,12,19,20]. Not unexpectedly, the uncertainty of the
age estimates for LECA is much greater. The estimates
vary approximately twofold if not more, from the most
recent ones at ~1.1-1.2 billion years ago (Gya) [3,21,22];
to the most ancient ones at ~2.3-2.7 Gya [23,24]. Other
studies have estimated the date of the divergence
between phototrophic eukaryotic groups at ~1.6 Gya,
with the implication that the primary radiation occurred
before that date [25].
According to the fossil record, eukaryotes were already
well diversified by ~ 1,500 Mya at the latest; however,
these fossils cannot be clearly associated with any of the
extant eukaryotic lineages [26-29]. In contrast to these
findings of unclassifiable, even if apparently eukaryotic

Page 2 of 18

fossils, stands the single report the identification of a
distinct multicellular eukaryotic fossil that appeared
indistinguishable from the extant red algae of the genus
Bangia and has been named Bangiomorpha pubescens
n. gen., n. sp [30]. This fossil comes from the ca. 1.2
Gya Hunting Formation, so if this date is correct, the
divergence of the eukaryotic supergroups and the differentiation of the major forms, including multicellular
ones, within the supergroups obviously occurred earlier.
Macroscopic fossils thought to represent primitive multicellular eukaryotes have been recently discovered in
~2.1 Gya shales [31] but these claims need to be taken
with much caution considering the closely similar
appearance of cyanobacterial mats [32].
An even older origin of eukaryotes has been inferred
from the existence of apparent eukaryotic bio-markers
such as C27-C29 steranes as far back as 2.7 Gya [26,33].
However, several lines of subsequent evidence seem to
discredit these indications as artifacts [12,34,35].
We were interested in applying the genome-wide analysis of rare genomic changes associated with conserved
amino acids (RGC_CAs) [36] to date the divergence of
extant eukaryotes. Lately, the analysis of RGCs that can
be exemplified by diagnostic gene fusions, domain architectures of proteins, or features of genome architecture
such as insertions of mobile elements became an increasingly popular approach to study evolutionary relationships, given that these characters appear to be less prone
to various artifacts than standard methods of molecular
phylogeny [36-39]. Although it can be argued that RGCbased methods effectively employ parsimony and so
would be subject to the same artifacts as maximum parsimony methods in sequenced-based phylogenetic analysis,
this would not be the case if the RGCs were free of
homoplasy (parallel changes and reversals) which is the
primary problem for the maximum parsimony methods
[36,40]. Conceivably, if the analyzed changes are indeed
rare and their number is sufficiently large, the effect of
homoplasy would be minimized [36,41]. It should be
noticed that molecular phylogeny methods that employ
sophisticated models of sequence evolution, usually
within the maximum likelihood framework, are not without their own serious problems that are related, mostly,
to model over-specification and mis-specification (proverbial attempts to “fit an elephant”) [42-45]. Application
of sequence-based phylogenetic methods within the phylogenomic approach has the potential to substantially
increase the resolution power, but also poses challenges
owing to different optimal models of evolution for different genes [46-49]. The pitfalls that are inherent in even
the most advanced maximum likelihood and Bayesian
methods, in particular, in the phylogenomic setting, stimulate the search for RGCs that are most suitable for
phylogenetic analysis and molecular dating. In general,

Chernikova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:26

resolving complicated phylogenetic problems requires
reconciliation of conventional phylogenomic approaches
and RGC [12]. The RGC_CAs method combines some of
the advantages of RGC and traditional phylogenetic analysis because the analyzed characters are both rare
(amino acids that are conserved in multiple, distantly
related species) and sufficiently numerous to allow robust
statistical testing [36].
We applied the RGC_CA analysis to generate time estimates for some key events in the evolution of eukaryotes.
The combined results of RGC_CA analyses using different methods point to a “young” LECA (~1.2 Gya) while
yielding realistic and consistent time estimates for other
major divergence events in the evolution of eukaryotes.
Such a late date for the primary radiation of the extant
eukaryotes suggests a long stem phase in the evolution of
eukaryotes and has major biological implications.

Results
Approach and rationale

The RGC_CA approach [36,41] involved the analysis of
amino acid residues that are conserved in most of the
included eukaryotes, with the exception of a few species,
and the prokaryotic outgroup. The assumption is that
any character shared by the majority of eukaryotes and
the 10 diverse prokaryotes (the outgroup) is the ancestral
state, and accordingly, the species with a substitution in
the given position possess a derived state (one, two or
three nucleotide substitutions are allowed, Figure 1). Previous analyses have shown that amino acid changes that
meet these criteria are rare and therefore the frequency
of parallel emergence of such characters in different
lineages is expected to be low [36,41]. This property is
critically important for an RGC because homoplasy (parallel changes and reversals) is one of the primary causes
of artifacts in phylogenetic reconstructions [36,40]. To
assess the effect of homoplasy, we calculated the total
number of RGC_CAs (1339 characters) and the number
of RGC_CAs that are actually used for branch length
estimates (1132 RGC_CAs) (Figure 2) (see Methods and
Figure 3 for details). The difference between these two
values is the number of RGC_CAs that are not compatible with the species tree (Figure 2) and so are most likely
to result from homoplasy. Thus, the level of homoplasy
(~15% of the RGC_CAs) was relatively low although
some biases caused by homoplasy could not be ruled out.
The estimates of divergence times were obtained using
the respective calibration times (point or range) and the
branch lengths calculated from the RGC_CA analysis
(see Methods and Figure 3 for details). After calibrating
the RGC_CA approach using well established dates for
the divergence of vertebrate taxa, we employed it in
combination with four methods for molecular dating to
obtain time estimates for four major divergence events:

the primary radiation of the major eukaryotic lineages, i.
e., the age of LECA; the radiation of opisthokonts; the
radiation of animals; and divergence of monocot and
dicot plants. Although the deep topology of the eukaryotic tree remains uncertain, we assumed that the plantopisthokont divergence corresponded to the primary
split; this is compatible with the results of independent
attempts to root the eukaryotic tree. Accordingly, the
time estimate of this divergence was taken as a proxy
for the age of LECA. As discussed in the Introduction,
there is a single dated red algal fossil that seems to
point to an ancient origin of this group of eukaryotes.
We certainly could not ignore this data point but felt
that it had to be treated with special caution. So we first
describe date estimates made without the red algal calibration point and then, in a special section, address the
results obtained when this point is included. A detailed
description of the results obtained with the RGC_CA
approach is given in the Additional file 1.

Calibration of the RGC_CA approach using vertebrate
divergence dates

The concept of molecular clock-like behavior of phylogenetic characters is a controversial issue although these
characters are frequently used for divergence time estimates (see Introduction). In a previous study, we for
metazoans and demonstrated a reasonable consistency
of the time estimates for the divergence of metazoan
taxa obtained using RGC_CAMs [36]. The rates of
RGC_CAM appearance have been shown to be, approximately, the same in the analyzed terminal and internal
branches of three animal clades (nematodes, insects and
deuterostomes), suggesting that RGC_CAMs behave as
approximate molecular clock [36]. In the present work,

we calibrated the RGC_CA method using the dates for
vertebrate taxa divergence reported by Benton and
Donoghue [50] and compared the results with those
obtained using conventional sequence alignments. We
analyzed the alignments which included the original
data set of 716 KOGs [51] to which orthologs from 8
vertebrate species [Mus musculus (Mm), Canis familiaris (Cf), Monodelphis domestica (Md), Ornithorhynchus anatinus (Oa), Gallus gallus (Gg), Anolis
carolinensis (Ac), Xenopus tropicalis (Xt), Danio rerio
(Dr)] were added using the COGnitor procedure as
described in Methods.
The phylogenetic tree of vertebrates with branch
lengths measured in RGC_CAs and the appropriate calibration time intervals [50] is shown in the Additional
file 2. To analyze the molecular clock properties of
RGC_CAs, we plotted the rates of RGC_CAs accumulation (uncorrected for multiple changes) starting from all
terminal branches against midpoints of calibration intervals [50] (Additional file 2). The plot is nearly linear
with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.71. We also
calculated the standard Dayhoff distances from the sum
total of amino acid replacements in ungapped concatenated sequence alignments using the CODEML program
[52] (Additional file 2). The resulting plot was less linear
compared to the RGC_CA plot (Additional file 2), with
the correlation coefficient of 0.65. The observed better
performance of RGC_CAs compared to conventional
distances, in terms of linear dependence on divergence
time (Additional file 2), even for short phylogenetic distances (some internal branch lengths are effectively 0,
see Additional file 2) suggests that the RGC_CAs represent a reasonable approximate molecular clock and have
potential for molecular dating.
The primary radiation of eukaryotes: the age of LECA

The time estimates for the primary eukaryotic radiation
are shown in Table 1. The mean of the estimates from
all methods puts the age of LECA at ~1,130 Mya; the
distribution of all estimates is shown in the Additional
file 3.
Multidivtime [53] gave a rather narrow range of recent
Te estimates for the divergence of plants and opisthokonts (871 - 923 Mya), with the 95% confidence interval
from 719 Mya to 1,161 Mya (Additional file 1). The
PAML mcmctree program [52] yielded a broader range
of somewhat older dates (935 - 1,197 Mya), with the
95% confidence interval from 702 Mya to 1,808 Mya
(Additional file 1). The Te estimates produced by r8s
[54] pointed to yet slightly older dates in the range of
1,104-1,308 Mya (Additional file 1).
Maximum parsimony produced a relatively narrow
range of the T e estimates consistent with the results
obtained with other methods (1,021 - 1,384 Mya) when

the chicken calibration point was not used for time estimates (Additional file 1). With chicken included, a substantially wider (and unreasonable) range of the T e
estimates (1,470 - 3,053 Mya) was produced, probably
because of the major branch length differences (e.g., 36
RGC_CAs on the chicken branch compared to 18
RGC_CAs on the human branch) and the broad date
range (310-370 Mya) for that led to over-dispersion
(Additional file 1).
This problem prompted us to assess the reliability of
the calibration points using cross-validation analysis [55].
The general approach used for cross-validation is to
check the reliability of molecular clocks by comparing an
actual calibration point and a parsimony-estimated divergence time for a specific divergence event (using other
calibration points). Small differences between observed
and estimated values suggest that the molecular clock
assumption is (approximately) valid for a given dataset
and tree topology, whereas large differences indicate that
molecular clock is not applicable. The plot of Te vs. | Tc T e c |, i.e., estimates for the divergence times between
extant eukaryotes versus the absolute value of the difference between a calibration time X and the estimate for
the same divergence event, is shown in Figure 4. Clearly,
the extremely large Te values as well as the smallest Te
values correspond to poor estimates for the respective
calibration points, i.e., large differences between the estimates and calibration times. Thus, the extremely high Te
estimates obtained with the chicken calibration point
indeed are most likely artifacts caused by the long branch
leading to chicken.

In general, only a small fraction (4 out of 60) of the Te
estimates for the primary radiation of eukaryotes are
older than 1.6 Gya. The reasonable consistency of the
obtained time estimates and the typically narrow range
(with the exception of the outlier values given by the
calibration interval for the human-chicken divergence
discussed above; see Additional file 3) is compatible
with the approximate molecular clock properties of the

RGC_CAs (see above). Specifically, the rates of
RGC_CAs appearance were, approximately, the same in
the analyzed terminal and internal branches of the tree
except for some extreme cases of rate variability. This
conclusion is further supported by the observation that
the paths from LECA to different terminal branches of
the analyzed tree have similar lengths (Figure 2 and
Additional file 4). For example, the lengths of the paths
that lead from LECA to human (123 RGC_CAs) and to
Arabidopsis (118 RGC_CAs) (Additional file 4) are statistically indistinguishable (P = 0.75). Long branches are
characteristic of fast-evolving taxa such as unicellular
fungi and nematodes (Additional file 4). Apart from
these taxa, there were no substantial differences between
the lengths of paths from LECA to plants and animals
(Additional file 4) although the rate of evolution of
plants was systematically somewhat lower compared to
animals resulting in statistically significant differences
for some of the comparisons (Additional file 4).
Opisthokont radiation

Numerous molecular phylogenetic studies have convincingly shown that two major eukaryotic groups, Metazoa
and Fungi, derive from a common ancestor and form a
clade known as the opisthokonts [56-58]. The monophyly
of the opisthokonts is also supported by several shared
ultrastructural characteristics, such as the presence of a
unicellular motile stage bearing a single posterior flagellum and flattened mitochondrial cristae [57,58].
Although different methods produced a wide range of
estimates (761-2,336 Mya), in general, the results of
molecular dating with RGC_CA suggest a relatively late
divergence of animals and fungi: 39 out of 60 time estimates are less than 1,000 Mya (Additional file 1). The
average Te estimates for PAML, mcmctree, Multidivtime,
r8s and maximum parsimony were 774 Mya, 895 Mya,
1,014 Mya and 1,114 Mya, respectively (Table 1). The
95% confidence interval for Muldivetime was reasonably
narrow, from 622 Mya to 981 Mya (Additional file 1).
The PAML mcmctree 95% confidence interval was much
wider, from 601 Mya to 1,559 Mya (Additional file 1).
The mean of the estimates from all methods yielded a
divergence time for opisthokonts at 949 Mya (Table 2), a
value that is well compatible both with the age of LECA
estimated here, ~1,130 Mya, and the rapid divergence of
the major clades after the primary radiation of eukaryotes. Again, the only gross outliers appear in the parsimony analysis with the chicken calibration point, most
likely, for the reasons outlined above.
The radiation of bilaterian animal phyla and Cambrian
explosion

For the radiation of the bilaterian animal phyla, PAML
mcmctree, multidivtime and r8s produced consistent

Page 6 of 18

time estimates in the range of 495 - 719 Mya (Additional files 1 and 3). Maximum parsimony yielded a very
similar range of Te values for divergence of animals (473
- 691 Mya) when chicken calibration point was not used
for time estimates (Additional file 1). As in other cases,
a much wider range of Te values (501 - 1203 Mya) was
obtained when the chicken calibration point was
included, probably because of artifacts caused by large
branch length differences (see above).
In general, these time estimates are much more recent
than the previously reported early divergence dates for
animal phyla, i.e., 970-1,040 Mya [59,60]. The mean
RGC_CA-based estimate for the nematodes-insects-vertebrates divergence time is 619 Mya (Table 2 and Figure 5).
These time estimates for the radiation of the animal phyla
are better compatible with the Cambrian explosion, the
well-known phenomenon of the rapid, almost simultaneous
(on the geological scale) appearance of the animal phyla in
the fossil record during the Cambrian[61,62], than the previously reported older estimates from molecular data [63].
Paleontological evidence suggests rapid, compressed cladogenesis soon after the origin of Metazoa approximately 600
Mya, with poriferans [64], cnidarians [65], and many of the
bilaterian phyla making their appearance within 100 Mya
[66]. Thus, inferences from these two independent lines of
evidence (molecules and fossils) seem to support the origin
of the Metazoa in the immediate aftermath of the global
Neoproterozoic glaciation [64].
Divergence of monocotiledonous and dicotiledonous
plants

The divergence time of the monocot and dicot plants is
yet another controversial issue. Fossil evidence suggests
that flowering plants (angiosperms) first appeared ~140
million years (Mya) ago in the early Cretaceous [67]. The
time estimates for the monocot-dicot divergence based on
molecular data are highly variable but generally predate
the angiosperm fossil record, ranging from 140-190 Mya
[68,69] to ~200 Mya [70,71] or even 300-320 Mya [72-74].
Our time estimates (Figure 5) are consistent with those
reported by Martin et al. and Brandl et al. [72-74]: all
methods employed in this study produced a narrow range
of the T e values for the divergence of monocot-dicot
plants (306 - 433 Mya) except when the 370 Mya humanchicken calibration point was used for time estimates
using maximum parsimony (Additional file 1). With this
calibration point, substantial over-dispersion was observed
for all analyzed divergence time estimates, so these results
are likely to be a branch-length-related artifact (see above).

of the most important and controversial dates relevant
for the temporal mapping the evolution of eukaryotes.
Indeed, this appears to be the only report of a eukaryotic fossil from the early Proterosoic that belongs to an
extant taxon and as such implies an old LECA. Of
course, it has been reasonably argued that single fossils
bear their own load of uncertainty in taxonomy identification and age determination [75]. Cumulative geological studies of the last decade seem to suggest that the
safest age estimate for the Hunting Formation that contained the Bangiomorpha fossil is 1,100-1,222 Mya
(Linda Kah, personal communication 2010). Accordingly, in the present study, we used this date interval for
calibration after incorporating the orthologs from the
red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae into the analyzed
alignments.

Multidivtime 95% confidence intervals (in parentheses) are shown
next to the respective nodes. The size of the circles is approximately

The results obtained with and without using the red
algal calibration interval are summarized in Tables 1
and 2. Predictably, these time estimates were systematically older compared to the estimates without the red
alga (Tables 1 and 2) given that the length of the branch
red algae to LECA is not negligible (Additional file 5).
The distribution of time estimates for LECA was bimodal, with the substantial majority of estimated dates
located in the 1250 - 1300 Mya interval and a minority
of estimates around 1450 Mya (Additional file 6). This
bimodality is likely to be an artifact of the maximum
parsimony estimation which is based on the upper
bound of the calibration interval (all estimates are in the
range of 1448-1466 Mya) given that all other approaches
yielded more recent dates (Additional file 1). The same
bimodal shape is seen for the distribution of opisthokont
time estimates (Additional file 6). Time estimates for
bilaterian animal divergence were in the range of 710 790 Mya (Additional file 6) which is considerably older
compared to the results obtained without the red algae
(Table 1). A broad range of estimates was also obtained
for the divergence of monocot and dicot plants (Table 1
and Additional file 6). In general, although the estimated
dates were systematically older than those without the
red algal calibration interval, the resulting overall time
scale of eukaryotic evolution (Figure 6) was not dramatically different from that obtained without the red algal
data (Figure 5) and still compatible with a “(relatively)
young LECA”.

Discussion
Accurate reconstruction of the branching order for the
major eukaryotic lineages is an extremely challenging
task given the low information content of alignments of
highly diverged sequences and the compressed cladogenesis that seems to be characteristic of the primary
radiation of eukaryotes [5-7]. Dating these ancient divergences using molecular clock methods is even more difficult [1,2,19,20]. First, estimates of divergence dates are
only meaningful if the phylogeny they are based upon is
correct. Second, molecular dating requires accurate substitution models for the genes under consideration over

billion-year time-scales as well as models that account
for substitution rate variation across the tree branches
[1,2,19,20]. Finally, divergence time estimation obviously
requires reliable calibration points (dates) that only can
be extracted from the fossil record and are associated
with errors of several types including the error inherent
in the dating of the associated geological strata; a systematic bias due to the fact that the true divergence
date must be older than the first appearance of the descendant taxa in the fossil record; and the error associated with the extrapolation far outside the range of
the calibration points that is inevitable in the estimation
of ancient divergence times [2,19].
The use of RGCs has the potential to alleviate at least
one of the key sources of error in molecular dating,
namely evolutionary rate variation between branches of
the tree (violation of molecular clock). Indeed, here we
found that the rate of RGC_CA accumulation showed a
stronger linear dependence on calibration divergence
times inferred from the fossil record than the overall
rate of substitution accumulation, suggesting that the
RGC_CAs approximate molecular clock better despite
the smaller number of data points. Further, cross-validation analysis supports the approximate molecular clock
behavior of RGC_CAs because the rates of RGC_CA
accumulation are, approximately, the same in the analyzed terminal and internal branches of the tree except
for some extreme cases of rate variability. This conclusion is further buttressed by the narrow distribution of
the distances from LECA to extant species measured in
RGC_CA units.

Page 8 of 18

A specific advantage of the RGC_CA-based dating is
that this approach is relatively robust to errors in the
branching order. The overall tree topology is not critical:
what matters is only the correct topology of four
branches involved in a particular estimate (Figure 3).
With respect to the latter requirement, to estimate the
age of LECA, we assumed that the divergence of plants
and animals/fungi is the most ancient event in the evolution of eukaryotes. This assumption is compatible
with the results of the eukaryotic root inference by different methods as well as the detailed phylogenetic analyses that led to the proposals of megagroups [13,16-18].
Different methods used in this study generally produced highly consistent time estimates for the primary
divergence of eukaryotes (age of LECA), divergence of
the animal phyla, divergence of opisthokonts and the
dicot-monocot divergence. The distributions of all estimates span rather narrow time intervals, with the sole
exception of the estimates obtained with maximum parsimony and the human-chicken calibration point at 370
Mya (Additional file 3).
The means of the estimates from all employed methods are 339 Mya for the dicot/monocot split; 619 Mya
for the radiation of the Bilaterian animal phyla; 949 Mya
for the radiation of opisthokonts; 1130 Mya for LECA
(Figure 5). The inclusion of the still controversial red
algal calibration date [30] along with the corresponding
sequence data predictably pushed all the dates back
(Figure 6). Nevertheless, even with this ancient date
included, we obtained indications of a “young” age of
LECA, with the mean of 1173 Mya (the implication of
this estimate is a rapid, explosive post-LECA divergence
of the main eukaryotic lineages so that less than 100
million years separates LECA from the appearance of
red algae).
The origin and radiation of the angiosperms is a wellknown difficult problem that fascinated biologists since
the days of Darwin who called it “an abominable mystery” [76]. The current consensus in the plant evolution
community seems to be a relatively late crown angiosperm radiation, at 140-180 Mya [77]. Even these estimates predate the appearance of indisputable
angiosperm fossils that date to ~120 Mya [78]. Recently,
an uncorrelated relaxed-clock analysis yielded an older,
late Triassic date of approximately 217 Mya [79]. This
date is at the low boundary of the range see in the present work (Figure 5). However, earlier studies that
employed phylogenies of individual, highly conserved
genes and a careful interpolation from several calibration points gave an estimate of ~300 Mya for the dicot/
monocot split, in a good agreement with our present
estimates [72-74]. A recent detailed study has dated the
origin of the Coleoptera (beetles), i.e., the radiation of
the major lineages of the holometabolous insects, earlier

Chernikova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:26
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/26

than previously suspected, at ~285 Mya [80]. If the
radiation of angiosperms indeed predated the insect
radiation, as suggested by the comparison of the respective estimates, the attractive hypothesis of plant-insect
coevolution and the dependence of insect diversification
on herbivory, that has been dismissed owing to the
assumed late date of angiosperm radiation [80], might
become relevant again.
The radiation of animal phyla in relation to the Cambrian explosion is possibly an even more controversial
matter that the radiation of angiosperms. The appearance of the bilaterian phyla, which constitutes the
“explosion proper”, has been dated with considerable
precision to 542-520 Mya [81]. Several estimates using
molecular clock point to substantially older radiation
dates: the extensive variation notwithstanding, all these
studies estimated the divergence time between protostomes and deuterostomes to be >700 Mya [75,82,83],
leading to the idea of a long interval of “invisible” animal evolution before the Cambrian explosion. However,
the use of Bayesian relaxed molecular clock approaches
yielded younger date estimates of 582 +/- 112 Mya [84]
or 642-761 Mya (mean 695) [22] which are compatible
both with the estimate obtained here and with the fossil
record. Similar estimates have been obtained in another
study that employed molecular clock but used invertebrate rather than vertebrate calibration points [85].
These younger dates have been subsequently questioned
on methodological grounds [59]. Nevertheless, a comprehensive analysis using a variety of molecular clock
methods combined with Bayesian techniques yielded
estimates for the protostome/deuterostome split in the
range of 733-641 Mya [63] which, taking the confidence
intervals into account, is compatible with our RGC_CAbased estimate (although the inclusion of the red algal
data yields a wider range that at the outside is compatible with ancient divergence long preceding the explosion). These convergent younger dates for the radiation
of the bilaterian phyla support the hypothesis that the
bilaterian cladogenesis took place during the latest preCambrian period, the Ediacaran (635-542 Mya), whereas
skeletons that are best preserved as fossils evolved during the Cambrian, creating the appearance of explosion
[63,86,87].
The case of the fungi/metazoan split tells a story similar to that of the bilaterian radiation. Molecular clock
methods produce date estimates as ancient as 1,600
Mya [88] but the Bayesian relaxed molecular clock
approach gives much younger dates of 872-1,127 Mya
(mean 983 Mya) [22] which overlaps with our estimate.
The age of LECA arguably is the most consequential
date that we estimated. Our results suggests that the
primary radiation of eukaryotes occurred about 1.1-1.2
Gya, or around 1.4 Gya at the earliest (when the red

Page 9 of 18

algal fossil data are used for calibration), in agreement
with the results previously obtained with relaxed Bayesian molecular clock [3,22] but clearly not with estimates obtained with simpler molecular clock models
that point to an ancient radiation of eukaryotes at
~2,500 Mya [24]. Given the convergence of independent
dating approaches on the “young LECA”, buttressed by
the agreement between these methods on other key
dates such as the bilaterian radiation and the fungi/
metazoa split, it seems that the possibility that the diversification of all extant eukaryotes occurred no earlier
than ~1.4 Gya should be taken seriously. The implications of a young LECA are manifold and might substantially affect our understanding of the origin and early
evolution of eukaryotes.
The late origin of the extant eukaryotic diversity
implies a substantial time gap between LECA and the
earliest occurrence of (apparent) eukaryotic fossils which
are confidently dated to times in the early Proterozoic
(>1,500 Mya) [12,26-28,31]. Given that collectively the
evidence for the ancient appearance of eukaryotes seems
solid, the several hundred years of eukaryotic evolution
before LECA requires explanation. A simple, straightforward scenario has been put forward by Philippe and
Adoutte [89] who proposed that the diversification of
eukaryotes was intimately linked to the mitochondrial
endosymbiosis and that the beginning oxygenenation of
the oceans thought to have started ~1,000 Mya [90] was
the principal trigger of the evolution of the aerobic
eukaryotes [12]. This scenario implies that the earliest
eukaryotes were amitochondrial organisms, sometimes
denoted archezoa [91-93]. However, an alternative,
potentially more plausible scenario should be considered
in light of the arguments that the mitochondrial endosymbiosis probably was the cause of eukaryogenesis
rather than a relatively late capture of an a-proteobacterium by an archezoan [94-97]. The conclusion on the
young LECA adds credibility to the ideas that the original
main function of mitochondria was distinct from aerobic
respiration and could involve other forms of metabolic
symbiosis between the (archaeal) host and an a-proteobacterium (these hypotheses are also best compatible
with the latest geochemical data that date the beginning
of ocean oxygenation much later during the Neoproterozoic, perhaps, at 700-800 Mya [98]). Probably, the most
coherent scenario of this type is the hydrogen hypothesis
of Martin and Müller according to which the selective
advantage of the symbiosis consisted in the production of
molecular hydrogen needed for the host metabolism by
the endosymbiont [99].
It seems likely that during the pre-LECA stem phase
of eukaryotic evolution, the diversification of the primitive eukaryotes was limited as suggested by the fossil
evidence [28]. It remains unclear what factors would

Chernikova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:26
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/26

trigger the explosive radiation that, according to the
current estimates, occurred some 1.1 Gya. Regardless of
the exact scenario of the evolution of eukaryotes, young
LECA implies that we know next to nothing about a
long and formative early part of the history of eukaryotes. Even if the early diversity of eukaryotes is incomparable to that created by the post-LECA radiation,
there certainly were multiple lineages, and LECA
obviously belonged only to one of these, and we know
nothing about the rest. Indeed, inference of events that
occurred during these “dark ages” is a formidable task
because comparative genomics of eukaryotes cannot
directly look past LECA. However, there are still ways
to decipher some aspects of that early evolution, in particular, through detailed study of the numerous eukaryote-specific gene duplications [100] that, under the
young LECA scenario, could have accumulated gradually
over an extended period of time.

Conclusion
Molecular dating is a formidably difficult enterprise due
to multiple sources of intrinsic artifacts, yet there is no
alternative to it for associating events in the evolution of
life with the geological and geochemical history. Congruence between independent methods can greatly increase
the confidence in the inferred dates. We show here that
the RGC_CA behave like an approximate molecular
clock and, when different estimation methods are used,
consistently yield similar time estimates for key divergence events. In particular, these estimates point to a
relatively late divergence of the major bilaterian lineages
closely predating the Cambrian explosion and to a (relatively) young LECA, with the primary radiation of eukaryotes occurring between 1.0-1.4 Gya. The young LECA
scenario implies several hundred million years of “hidden” evolution of eukaryotes for which virtually no data
are available. If this is a valid depiction of the evolutionary history of eukaryotes, developing approaches to the
study of the pre-LECA stem phase of eukaryotic evolution is a major challenge for evolutionary biologists.
Methods
Amino acid sequence alignments

Each of the 716 protein alignments (488,157 sites altogether) constructed from a previously delineated set of
highly conserved clusters of eukaryotic orthologous
genes, or KOGs [101] analyzed here included orthologs
from 7 eukaryotic species with completely sequenced
genomes: Homo sapiens (Hs), Caenorhabditis elegans
(Ce), Drosophila melanogaster (Dm), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp), Arabidopsis thaliana (At), and Anopheles gambiae (Ag) [51]. To
these KOGs, probable orthologs from 66 prokaryotic
genomes from the COG database [102] were added

Page 10 of 18

using a modification of the COGNITOR method [103].
Briefly, all protein sequences from the prokaryotic genomes are compared to the protein sequences previously
included in the KOGs; a protein is assigned to a KOG
when two genome specific best hits to members of the
given KOG are detected. We added 10 prokaryotic
orthologs (denoted below P1, ..., P10) to each KOG and
required these prokaryotic orthologs to belong to 5 or
more major prokaryotic clades (see Additional file 7)
[104]. The requirement for the availability of 10 diverse
prokaryotic orthologs was satisfied for 330 of the initially selected 716 KOGs. To the resulting mixed C/
KOGs, probable orthologs from four other eukaryotic
genomes, namely, those of rice Oryza sativa (Os), moss
Physcomitrella patens (Pp), chicken Gallus gallus (Gg),
and red algae Cyanidioschyzon merolae (Cm) were
added using COGNITOR. For calibration of the
RGC_CA approach, we analyzed the multiple alignments
for the original data set of 716 KOGs [51] to which
orthologs from 8 vertebrate species [Mus musculus
(Mm), Canis familiaris (Cf), Monodelphis domestica
(Md), Ornithorhynchus anatinus (Oa), Gallus gallus
(Gg), Anolis carolinensis (Ac), Xenopus tropicalis (Xt),
Danio rerio (Dr)] were added using the COGnitor procedure [103]. To minimize misalignment problems, only
conserved, unambiguously aligned regions of the alignments were subject to further analysis. Specifically, we
only analyzed positions surrounded by segments of protein alignments containing no insertions or deletions
within a 5-amino acid window from each side.
Rare genomic changes, RGC_CAs

To use the RGC_CA approach for the purpose of divergence time estimation [36,41], we analyzed amino acid
residues that are conserved in most of the included
eukaryotes, with the exception of a few species, and the
prokaryotic outgroup. The assumption is that any character shared by the included 10 diverse prokaryotic outgroup species (P1, ..., P10) and the majority of eukaryotes
is the ancestral state, whereas the deviating species possess a derived state (Figure 1). To simplify further presentation, we use the following notation: S1 ≠ S2 = S3 means
that, for a conserved amino acid position in an alignment,
species S2 and S3 share the same amino acid that is different from the amino acid in the species S1. Under this
notation, for example, a human-specific RGC_CA is
denoted by Hs ≠ At = Os = Sc = Sp = Dm = Ag = Ce =
Pp = Gg = P1 = P2 = P3 = P4 = P5 = P6 = P7 = P8 = P9
= P10, whereas an RGC_CA shared by the fungi and animals is denoted by Sc = Sp = Hs = Dm = Ag = Ce = Pp =
Gg ≠ At = Os = P1 = ... = P10.
Three sets of RGC_CA alignments were used for
molecular dating using various approaches (see below),
one consisting of 19 species (chicken and red algae not

Chernikova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:26
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/26

included) and 1339 amino acids positions, and two other
alignments consisting of 20 species: 1) chicken included,
red algae not included, 1161 amino acid positions; 2)
chicken not included, red algae included, 1295 amino
acid positions. Amino acid sequence alignments are
available at the authors’ Web site at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/pub/koonin/RGC_CA/.
Tree topologies and calibration intervals

For the alignment with 19 species, we used two calibration points or ranges (the maximum parsimony methods
uses points whereas the other three methods we
employed use took ranges): 260 Mya (250-260 Mya) for
drosophila-mosquito divergence time [105,106] and 450
Mya (430-450 Mya) [107,108] for moss-angiosperm
divergence time. For the alignments with 20 sequences,
we used the above two calibration points/ranges and in
addition either the 370 Mya (310-370 Mya) divergence
time for mammals-chicken [109] or the unpublished PbPb date of the oldest red algal fossil, 1122 Mya (11001222) [30] (Linda Kah, personal communication, 2010).
The latter range is considered to be the most reliable
estimate of the divergence date between the red algae
and other plants (Linda Kah, personal communication,
2010; see discussion below). To estimate divergence
times, four methods were employed: PAML mcmctree
[52], Multidivtime [53], R8S [54], and an ad hoc implementation of maximum parsimony [36].
PAML mcmctree

PAML’s mcmctree [52] is a Bayesian phylogenetics program used for estimating divergence times with multiple
calibration points. This program implements the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, takes a bifurcating tree
and accepts an upper and a lower bound on calibration
points. A relaxed molecular clock (independent rates)
model was used for all analyses. Divergence times were
estimated using both the Dayhoff and the Jones-TaylorThornton (JTT) amino acid replacement models.
Multidivtime

Multidivtime [53] is used for Bayesian analysis of evolutionary rates and divergence times. It employs the multivariate normal distribution to approximate the posterior
distribution of divergence times. The program accepts
an upper and lower limits on calibration points. Divergence times were estimated using both the Dayhoff and
the JTT amino acid replacement models.
R8S

The R8S program [54] estimates absolute rates of molecular evolution and divergence times. One of the methods R8S utilizes is a semiparametric method that relaxes
the stringency of the clock assumption using smoothing

Page 11 of 18

methods. The semiparametric approach combines a
parametric model with a different substitution rate on
every branch with a nonparametric roughness penalty
which penalizes the model if rates change too quickly
from branch to branch. R8S uniquely does not take
sequences as input, but instead takes branch lengths
and tree topology. In the settings, we chose the Penalized Likelihood (PL) semiparametric method that utilized the Truncated Newton (TN) algorithm, which
according to the authors of the program as best to use
with the Penalized Likelihood method [54]. We used a
smoothing value of 1 because we assumed that our
model was not clock-like. Through the cross-validation
procedure we found that a smoothing value of 1 was
usually optimal. As the R8S program accepts only
branch lengths and tree topology as input, we utilized
branch lengths calculated by the maximum parsimony
method described below.
Maximum Parsimony

First, we estimated the branch length for each analyzed
taxon in RGC_CA units [36]. For each species or group
of species, we calculated the number of amino acid residues that are different from all other species (e.g., Sc =
Sp ≠ At = Os = Pp = Dm = Ag = Hs = Ce = Gg = P1 =
... = P10 for fungi). An example of eukaryotic phylogeny
adopted in this study with calculated branch lengths is
shown in Figure 2. To calculate divergence times, we
assumed a strict molecular clock, where branch lengths
corresponded to the number of molecular changes, and
thus a fixed amount of time. Then, by using one calibration point at a time, and one branch path emanating
from the chosen calibration point, we obtained the
divergence time estimates. This method results in a
number of estimates for any given divergence time, each
corresponding to a different calibration point and
branch path (Figure 3). The formula for the divergence
time estimation for the path in Figure 3 is:
Te = Tc × [(L1 + L2 + L3 )/L3 ]

Te corresponds to estimated divergence time, Tc is the
calibration point, and Ln corresponds to the length of
branch n. In this formula, L3 is the length of the branch
emitting from the calibration point (Figure 3).

Reviewers’ comments
Reviewer 1: William Martin, University of Duesseldorf

This is an interesting and worthwhile paper reporting
calculations aimed to date major events in eukaryote
evolution using a molecular clock approach to rare
genomic changes. The authors use a multiplicity of
methods, and get a range of values, which they openly
report. Any criticism that could be leveled at molecular
clocks of substitutions could be applied here. The

Chernikova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:26
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/26

authors recognize that, hence there is no need to get
into the technical aspects of molecular dating
approaches.
I have only a few points to discuss.
1. First, Bangiomorpha is probably the best early calibration point there is, and the authors even report here
the unpublished Pb-Pb age of the fossil. Yes it is a single
fossil, but it is probably the best early plant (red alga),
and the authors basically throw it out, reporting estimates for major events in the abstract from analyses
that exclude Bangiomorpha. In my opinion, this is a
mistake, and it is the same mistake that Philippe made
in ref 22, and that is why the present sets of estimates
are so similar to those in ref 22. At the end of results
we see much more reasonable ages for LECA, more
compatible with the Javaux et al 1.45 Ga (billion years
ago) material. The justification for excluding Bangiomorpha (a single find, yes, but well dates and exquisitely
preserved) is not sound in my view. My inkling would
be to report those dates using 1.2 Ga for plants in the
abstract, too, and put suppl. information on the Bangiomorpha-based dates in the main text, not in the supplementary where no one will see it. As it stands, the best
constrained early fossil is incompatible with dates put
forth in this paper.
Authors’ response: We followed these suggestions by
adding Table 2 and Figure 6 for the red algal calibration
interval. We also mention the red algal calibration interval in the revised Abstract. Predictably, including this
calibration point led to some revision of the time estimates but nevertheless, even with these data, LECA
appears to be 1.4 billion years old at the most.
2. I just outlined how Bangiomorpha was dismissed,
and that that led to early dates. But, the dates are also too
young to accommodate Tapannia and other finds from
Javaux et al. dated at 1.45 (On the basis of better preserved material, Butterfield has reinterpreted Tappania
from ref 26 as possibly being a fungus. Butterfield NJ
(2005) Probable Proterozoic fungi. Paleobiology; v. 31;
no. 1; p. 165-182). The criticism is severe, it is this: For
Bangiomorpha, the authors opted to basically throw out
the fossil because it does not fit their dates (when their
dates actually should have been included that fossil in my
view); for Javaux et al. ref 26, 1.45 Ga, the fossil material
also does not fit their dates, but in THIS case the authors
opt to interpret this as evidence for a long period of
eukaryote evolution before the major modern groups
appear. This is very inconsistent reasoning. Were they to
be consistent, they would either have to a) throw out any
unassignable acritarchs like those of ref 26 (too), just like
they throw out Bangiomorpha or b) include Bangiomoprpha in which case 1.45 Ga material would no longer be
outside the range. In the case of a) they loose their title
and abstract evidence for extinct eukaryotic microbes (or

Page 12 of 18

“late” extant ones) because they would no longer accept
the ref 26 or similar material as eukaryotes, putting them
very close to Cavalier-Smith in terms of eukaryote age. In
the case of b) everything is more or less normal, making
this paper less of a splash perhaps but more consistent
piece of work.
Authors’ response: As pointed out above, we have chosen
option (b) by including Bangiomorpha, which has changed
the estimated dates, but not that dramatically. The vast
majority of these converged to the 1-1.4 Gya interval
which is far from Cavalier-Smith’s estimates. The title
stands, accordingly.
3. Supplementary table 6 says “with or without the red
alga” but only one set of values is reported, presumably
“without”, because the ranges cannot possibly correspond
to the LECA data in Suppl8. Or maybe I have missed
something altogether here, which brings me to another
point.
This table was for all trees, with and without red
alga. We replaced it with the table for the tree with red
algal data. This table is consistent with the Additional
file 6.
4. There are 10 supplemental files upon which the text
and the arguments (hence the fabric of paper) rely. This
annoyingly makes the referee and the reader click around
through 12 windows to try to read the paper. I am tired
of doing that anymore, and I think I am not alone. If I
am not mistaken, J. Neurosci. has stopped accepting supplemental altogether, and that is a lead that one can consider. Biol. Direct is not printed, why not put all of the
data that is essential to the paper in the paper and take
out the stuff that is not essential? The axis labels in the
Supplemental are problematic is several spots.
Authors’ response: We have merged three supplementary tables into the main Tables 1 and 2 and moved one
supplementary Figure (now Figure 6) to the main text.
Still, several additional files remain. We believe that
these files are indeed necessary but not as part of the
main text which is already rather extensive and technical. Biology Direct has a convenient way to navigate
through additional files in the HTML format.
Points 1 and 2 seem severe in my view. My hunch is
that many readers will see it similarly. Maybe I am
wrong.
Authors’ response: As pointed out above, we took care
of these points. The conclusions may have become less of
a ‘splash” but still stand. We added several qualifying
remarks such as (relatively) young LECA etc.

I have three major problems with this manuscript that
prevent me to perform a careful examination of the dating analysis per se.

1) Problems with the dataset

Determining the orthology of genes is a very difficult
issue (especially with species that underwent whole genome duplications, such as vertebrates). However, the
methods used in this manuscript (716 KOGs from 7
eukaryotes plus a few additional taxa using COGNITOR-reference is missing-) are extremely rough and
very likely produced numerous alignments containing
non-orthologous copies. As an example, I analyzed the
gene displayed on Figure 1. First, it turned out that the
alignment is not from an RNA helicase but from carbamoylphosphate synthetase! Second, a phylogenetic analysis unambiguously demonstrated that sequences from
plants are of cyanobacterial origin; in other words, the
last shown RGC_CA is for a xenologous gene. It is
therefore necessary to perform in depth controls to verify orthology.
Another important problem with the use of nucleotide
sequences without quality controls is due to the existence of sequencing errors and incorrect intron/exon
predictions. My own experience with these genomic
data, obtained through the manual analysis of several
hundreds of conserved genes, is that this represents a
non-negligible problem, especially, in the case of
RGC_CA: if the intron/exon prediction is incorrect for a
single species at a highly conserved position, this will
generate a RGC_CA. I think that the less accurate annotation of the Gallus versus the Homo genome provides a
very likely explanation for the much longer branch of
Gallus (36 versus 16 RGC_CA). Because the RGC_CA
approach focuses on a very limited number of positions,
it is highly sensitive to orthology and annotation errors.
Therefore, these two problems must be carefully
assessed.
Authors’ response: We regret the problem with Figure
1. The original version of Figure 1was just an example of
an RGC_CA. This particular RGC_CA came from our
earlier studies but was never actually used for time estimates in the current work because, due to the relatively
high variability in prokaryotes, this KOG did not pass
the criteria applied for prokaryotic orthologs in the present study. We fully agree that it is only appropriate to
use an example from this particular study, so in the
revised version Figure shows the alignment for KOG0100
which is part of the present analysis.
Orthology identification certainly has its share of complications and pitfalls. We used a filtering procedure to
delineate genes with putative cyanobacterial origin:
KOGs with the best BLASTP hit to cyanobacteria were
not used in this study (see Methods).
We also compared different approaches for assigning
orthology using manual checking and information on the
location of introns. Our assessment indicates that the
current version of COGnitor is reliable. All alignments

Page 13 of 18

with multiple RGC_CAs were manually checked, and
several obvious cases of misidentification of orthology (e.
g. complete loss of all catalytic residues characteristic of
a given family of enzymes) were removed. Having said
this, we generally attempted to minimize the extent of
manual curation. The problem is that manual curation
does not always guarantee 100% success because different researchers may have very different ideas of “undesirable” alignments. The subjectivity that is inherent in
manual curation and elimination of “bad” alignments
has the potential to severely bias phylogenetic analysis,
so we attempted to limit the application of this
approach.
In order to increase the robustness of the RGC_CA
approach, we used reliable portions of amino acid alignments (no indels in region ± 5 aa around RGC_CAs).
We also have experimented with amino acid conservation in the regions ± 5 aa; this does not change results,
so the indel restriction appears to be rigorous enough.
2) Problems with the species sampling

I will not repeat all the comments made by Roy and Irimia (2008) and by referees of the Rogozin et al. article
(Biology Direct 2008). But the arbitrary selection of a
handful of eukaryotic and prokaryotic species when >100
and >1000 complete genomes are available is highly problematic. First, one should verify that the results are not
sensitive to the choice of the species, because it has been
abundantly demonstrated that evolutionary inference is
sensitive to taxon sampling, especially when few species
are used. Second, it is obvious that an extremely powerful
method to minimize the effect of homoplasy is to use a
large number of species. Let us assume that a position is
evolving extremely rapidly (more than one change over
each branch of the tree), but can only accept Ala and Thr
for functional reasons. If one samples only 4 species, the
probability to observe the same amino acid in all species
is 1/8. So if one uses 488,157 sites as here, one would
observe many “constant” positions that are in fact completely saturated. Obviously, if one uses 100 species, the
probability of observing the same amino acid for all the
species is almost 0 (1e-30). In contrast, if a position is
really slowly evolving, the use of 4 or of 100 species will
yield the same, correct, result. As a result, I don’t see any
reasons to use such a limited number of taxa: since the
authors claim that RGC_CA is minimally affected by
homoplasy, the results should remain identical.
Authors’ response: We experimented with different
numbers of outgroup species by including 5 species (from
at least three different lineages, this setting has been used
previously for RGC_CAMs [104]), 10 species (from at least
five different lineages, this setting also was has been previously for RGC_CAMs), 15 species (from at least five different lineages), and 20 outgroup (from at least five
different lineages). The overall homoplasy level (fraction

Chernikova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:26
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/26

of RGC_CAs which are inconsistent with the species tree)
was employed as the quality control criterion. We found
that using 5 outgroup species produced a higher level of
homoplasy (21%) compared to 10 species (15%), whereas
further increase of the number of outgroup species did not
substantially change the overall homoplasy level (13% for
15 species, 14% for 20 species).
The number of eukaryotic species also might influence
the homoplasy level of RGC_CAs. We analyzed eukaryotic species which we used in the previous paper [36]. We
did not observe substantial differences in the sum of parallel changes and reversals for RGC_CAs when the number of species varied between 14 and 19 (for 14, 15, 16,
17, 18, and 19 species the fraction of parallel changes
and reversals were 0.08, 0.09, 0.08, 0.0.7, 0.10, and 0.08,
respectively).
3) Problems with RGC_CA

RGC_CAMs were defined as “amino acid replacements
that require 2 or 3 nucleotide substitutions, in order to
reduce homoplasy” (MBE 2007 24:1080, ref. 41). This
was deemed necessary to address a relatively recent evolutionary history (Bilateria). I have to analyze
Figure 1 to discover that the authors relax the constraints of two or three nucleotide substitutions and now
work on replacements that require only a single substitution. In other words, they accept more homoplasy to
study a much more ancient phylogenetic question. I am
unable to find the rationale behind that choice.
More importantly, I am not convinced by the reliability
of the RGC_CA approach. As pointed out by Roy and Irimia, the fact that support for Coelomata is replaced by
support for Ecdysozoa, when adding a close outgroup
clearly demonstrates limitations of the RGC_CA
approach. This is confirmed by the analysis of the position of Figure 1. I rapidly looked at this position in a few
other species. In opisthokonts, which should have a
highly conserved T, I observed that:
• Acyrthosiphon displays a S
• Ashbya displays a L
• Pyrenophora and Phaeosphaeria display a Q
• Podospora, Sordaria, Chaetomium and Neurospora
display a A
• Cryptococcus and Trichosporon display a V
• there are 2 paralogs in Monosiga and they display A
and T
In bikonts, which should have a highly conserved A:
• All kinetoplastids (~10 species) display a Q
• Apicomplexa display 5 S and 3 A
• Stramenopiles diplay 7 T, 2 A and 1 S
• Ricinus displays a T
In ~10 randomly chosen Archaea, which should have
a highly conserved A:
• Natronomonas displays a T
• Sulfolobus diplays a S

Page 14 of 18

• Pyrococcus diplays a V
In ~40 randomly chosen Bacteria, which should have a
highly conserved A:
• Elusimicrobium, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Catenibacterium, Ktedonobacter,
Sorangium and Waddlia display a T
• Dictyoglomus, Bachyspira, Escherichia and
Methylobacillus
• Caulobacter display a G
• Ilyobacter and Bacteroides display a V
This quick analysis demonstrated that this position is
not a RGC_CA, but had accepted many different substitutions. It is therefore very likely that this position will
yield an unreliable signal when analyzed by maximum
parsimony with a few species (i.e. an approach inefficient to detect multiple substitutions).
Authors’ response: There is no need to re-investigate a
single RGC_CA in order to compare these characters with
RGC_CAMs. We have previously reported such an analysis for numerous RGC_CAs [36]. Predictably, this analysis
has shown that the homoplasy level of RGC_CAs is
roughly 1.5-2 times higher compared to RGC_CAMs. In
addition, below we present another RGC_CA vs.
RGC_CAM comparison which also suggests that the
homoplasy level is higher for RGC_CAs but not overwhelmingly so. However, there are two important reasons to
use RGC_CAs instead of RGC_CAMs in this study. First,
in this case, the dataset is much larger resulting in more
reliable results and allowing one to use conventional phylogenetic methods. Second, the two Bayesian methods
used in this study are not applicable to RGC_CAMs
because of the requirement of at least two nucleotide substitutions for amino acid substitutions.
These three major issues must be addressed before
using these characters for molecular dating. I have nevertheless a few comments on the results. They are poorly
presented, most of them being dispatched in several supplementary files, which make the evaluation difficult. I
must also acknowledge that I was not able to fully understand the cross-validation (Figure 4), which is insufficiently explained.
Authors’ response: Additional explanations have been
included on cross-validation in the main text and in the
legend of Figure 4. As pointed out above in the response to
Reviewer 1, three supplementary tables have been merged
into the main Tables 1 and 2, and one supplementary
Figure (now Figure 6) has been moved to the main text.
Still, several additional files remain. We believe that these
files are indeed necessary but not as part of the main text.
Biology Direct has a convenient way to navigate through
additional files in the HTML format. As also noticed
above, Biology Direct has a convenient way to navigate
through the Additional Files in the HTML format (we do

Chernikova et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:26
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/26

realize that it is less convenient during the review process
and regret this inconvenience).
Moreover, several statements are too vague (e.g.
“demonstrated a reasonable consistency of the time estimates”, “to be, approximately, the same in the analyzed
terminal and internal branches”); the most important
issue was the statement: “suggesting that RGC_CAMs
behave as a relaxed molecular clock” (by the way, there is
no comments in the text here on that fact that
RGC_CAM could behave differently from RGC_CA, and
the difference between the two approaches is not
explained). Any set of homologous characters DO behave
as a approximate molecular clock, even if it behaves as a
strict molecular clock. The authors mistake “relaxed
molecular clock” for “approximate molecular clock":
approximate molecular clocks correspond to model rate
variation over time (e.g. with autocorrelation).
Authors’ response: To the best of our understanding, the
statements marked “vague” by the reviewer are sufficiently
explained in the text, figures and tables. We agree with
the reviewer that the properties of the RGC_CAs are
appropriately described as those of “approximate molecular clock”, so the necessary changes have been made
throughout the manuscript. We regret this confusion
which originated from the fact that the relaxed molecular
clock assumption is involved in some of the methods used
in this study.
Finally, I have concern with this sentence: “Previous
analyses have shown that amino acid changes that meet
these criteria are rare and therefore the frequency of parallel emergence of such characters in different lineages is
expected to be extremely low [36,41].” My understanding
is that the authors consider that, because the number of
positions displaying RGC_CA is very low, homoplasy is
very rare at these positions. If my understanding is correct, there is a flaw in this logic. The only way to demonstrate that homoplasy is low at a given position is to
analyze thousands of species for which phylogeny is
approximately known and to verify that only a few substitutions are necessary to explain the data. On the other
hand, one can look for positions that have a different
amino acid in each of the 10 eukaryotic species under
study and a same, but different, amino acid in each of the
ten prokaryotic species. My prediction is that we will
observe very few such positions (probably much less than
RGC_CA positions), but this does not mean that these
positions are homoplasy free.
Authors’ response: In the revision, “extremely” has been
removed. As pointed out above, there is an inevitable
trade-off between the number of characters and the level
of homoplasy, so RGC_CAs are more homoplasy-prone
than RGC_CAMs. An important question asked by the
reviewer is how frequently RGC_CAs (which are 2-state
characters) are in reality 3, 4, 5 etc.- states characters.

Page 15 of 18

We analyzed all columns located in the conserved portions of alignments and are conserved in the outgroup
(similar to RGC_CA restrictions). We found for the
RGC_CAM restriction that 93% of characters are truly
2-state RGC_CAM characters (6% and 1% of 3- and 4state characters were found). The fraction of 3,4 et.-state
RGC_CA-like characters is higher compared to
RGC_CAMs (17%), however the fraction of 2-state
RGC_CAs is still high (84%). The 3- and 4-state characters were relatively rare (13% and 3%). These results suggested that RGC_CA-like characters rarely exist in many
states so RGC_CAs are truly rare genomics changes,
although they are prone to homoplasy as (almost) any
other phylogenetic character. The question is the homoplasy level which, in our opinion, is acceptable for
RGC_CAs. We cannot guarantee that other sites in
alignments have a homoplasy level low enough for efficient use of phylogenetic methods for long evolutionary
distances. In this case heuristic attempts to shred long
branches into shorter ones using as many species as possible might be important.
In addition to the mixing of RNA helicase and of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase in
Figure 1, there are some inconsistencies in this
manuscript:
• In additional file 2, a lizard is present, but this is not
indicated in the M&M.
Authors’ response: Corrected.
• “To the resulting mixed C/KOGs, probable orthologs
from three other eukaryotic genomes, namely, those of
rice Oryza sativa (Os), moss Physcomitrella patens (Pp),
chicken Gallus gallus (Gg), and red algae Cyanidioschyzon merolae (Cm) were added using COGNITOR.”
Replace three by four.
Authors’ response: Corrected
• In the legend of Figure 4, “Estimates for three calibration points are shown.” But I am unable to see them.
Authors’ response: We added an explanation: “Results
obtained for all three calibration intervals (Figure 2)
were pooled together”.
