Abstract
Background: Malaria has a devastating impact on worldwide public health in many tropical areas. Studies on
vector immunity are important for the overall understanding of the parasite-vector interaction and for the design
of novel strategies to control malaria. A member of the fibrinogen-related protein family, fbn9, has been well
studied in Anopheles gambiae and has been shown to be an important component of the mosquito immune
system. However, little is known about this gene in neotropical anopheline species.
Methods: This article describes the identification and characterization of the fbn9 gene partial sequences from four
species of neotropical anopheline primary and secondary vectors: Anopheles darlingi, Anopheles nuneztovari,
Anopheles aquasalis, and Anopheles albitarsis (namely Anopheles marajoara). Degenerate primers were designed
based on comparative analysis of publicly available Aedes aegypti and An. gambiae gene sequences and used to
clone putative homologs in the neotropical species. Sequence comparisons and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses
were then performed to better understand the molecular diversity of this gene in evolutionary distant anopheline
species, belonging to different subgenera.
Results: Comparisons of the fbn9 gene sequences of the neotropical anophelines and their homologs in the An.
gambiae complex (Gambiae complex) showed high conservation at the nucleotide and amino acid levels, although
some sites show significant differentiation (non-synonymous substitutions). Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of
fbn9 nucleotide sequences showed that neotropical anophelines and African mosquitoes form two well-supported
clades, mirroring their separation into two different subgenera.
Conclusions: The present work adds new insights into the conserved role of fbn9 in insect immunity in a broader
range of anopheline species and reinforces the possibility of manipulating mosquito immunity to design novel
pathogen control strategies.

Background
Mosquito-borne diseases, including malaria and arboviruses, such as dengue, depend on complex interactions
among pathogens, insect vectors, and hosts. Studies of
vector immunity are of particular importance to understanding these complex interactions and could lead to
the development of novel disease control strategies
[1-6]. Vectorial competence, which refers to the ability
of arthropods to acquire, maintain, and transmit microbial agents [7], is directly related to insect immunity.
Several immunity-related genes have been identified in

Old World vectors [8-10]. However, related studies in
neotropical anopheline species are still incipient.
Among the important immunity genes are the ones
enconding members of the fibrinogen-related protein
family (FREP or FBN), which are pattern recognition
receptors and have been considered as promising candidates for parasite control strategies [10-12]. Within this
family, the fbn9 gene was found to be upregulated when
Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes were fed on blood
infected with parasites (Plasmodium falciparum) or bacteria (Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus) [10].
Furthermore, when this gene was knocked-down, parasite loads significantly increased [10]. More recently, the
fbn9 gene was found to be conserved among members
of the An. gambiae complex [13]. The An. gambiae

complex comprehends seven closely related species (An.
gambiae, Anopheles arabiensis, Anopheles melas, Anopheles merus, Anopheles bwambae, and Anopheles quadriannulatus A and B), from which An. gambiae and An.
arabiensis have been described as important vectors of
human malaria [14].
In South America, the most important malaria vectors
comprise the Anopheles (Nyssorhynchus) darlingi, Anopheles albimanus, and members of the Anopheles albitarsis complex (An. albitarsis, Anopheles oryzalimnetes,
Anopheles marajoara, Anopheles deaneorum, Anopheles
janconnae, and An. albitarsis F) [15]. Secondary vectors
include Anopheles nuneztovari, Anopheles aquasalis and
other members of the same subgenera [16-19]. In Brazil,
of the 54 anopheline species that have been recorded, 13
were found to be naturally infected with Plasmodium spp.
[16,20], emphasizing the importance of further vector/
parasite studies, including laboratory-based infections.
The identification and characterization of the fbn9
gene partial sequences from four species of neotropical
anopheline mosquitoes has been performed in this
study, followed by comparisons to sequences of the An.
gambiae complex available in public databases. Further
comparisons of synonymous (silent) and non-synonymous (changing) substitution rates in its amino acid
sequence have been applied to try understanding its
molecular evolution. This study allowed a better understanding of the molecular diversity and predicted function of this immunity gene in a broader range of
mosquito species.

Methods
Mosquito collection and identification

Mosquitoes were collected from different locations (6070 specimens from each locality; Table 1). Anopheles
darlingi specimens were collected from larval breeding
sites and by capturing adults through traps in rural
areas of Manaus (Amazon, Brazil). Larvae were also collected and maintained in rearing conditions and adults
identified upon emergence. Anopheles albitarsis samples
were also collected in Porto Velho (Rondonia, Brazil).
Anopheles aquasalis was obtained from a laboratory colony reared at 27°C, 80% humidity and 12h L:D cycle
maintained at FIOCRUZ, Belo Horizonte-MG, Brazil.
Mosquitoes were individually identified according to
their morphology through taxonomic keys, which are
based on particularities on their tarsi, abdomen, and
wing veins [21]. The identification of specimens of the
An. albitarsis complex was confirmed by sequencing the
internal transcribed spacer 2, ITS2, as described below.
ITS2 genotyping

Genomic DNA has been isolated from pools of 10 mosquitoes following previously published protocol [22].

PCR reactions were performed using the primers CP16
(5’-GCGGGTACCATGCTTAAATTTAGGGGGTA-3’)
and CP17 (5’-GCGCCGCGGTGTGAACTGCAGGACACATG-3’) [23]. Each reaction contained 0.2 μM of each
primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, buffer (50 mM KCl, 10 mM
Tris-HCl pH 8.4. 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mg/mL gelatin),
milli-Q water to a final volume of 15 μL and 20 ng of
genomic DNA. Samples were subjected to 25 cycles of
94°C 1 min, 50°C 2 min, and 72°C 2 min and amplified
products were visualized on agarose gels. PCR reactions
were purified with the ExoSAP-IT® (USB), following the
manufacturer protocol. PCR products were cloned into
pGEM®-T Easy vector system (Promega) and after colony screening, positive clones were sequenced for the
ITS2 region. Sequencing reactions were performed using
the DYEnamic™ ET Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing
Kit and a MegaBACE™ DNA analysis system (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences).
Multiple sequences were obtained for each species
(Table 1) depending on the PCR colony screening
results and then further assembled. Sequences were analysed using PHRED/PHRAP/Consed [24] as well as by
the Crossmatch software to trim vector sequences [25].
Sequence similarity searches were performed using the
blastx program of the BLAST package against different
databases [26]. Further comparisons have been performed between sequences described in the present
work with those published elsewhere [23,27].
Identification of fbn9

The identification of the fbn9 gene sequences of four
neotropical anophelines (Table 1) was performed
through PCR and sequencing analyses as follows. First,
degenerate primers were designed based upon highly
similar regions between two fbn9 homologs in An. gambiae (AGAP011197) and Ae. aegypti (AY432284.1) translated sequences available in public databases. PCR
reactions were performed with 0.5 μM of each primer:
5fbn_deg4 (5’-AAYCARGCNCAYYTNGARAA-3’) and
3fbn_deg4 (5’-CANCCICCICCRAAYTTNGTYTG-3’)
with the following parameters: 94°C 5 min, 15 cycles
(94°C 30 sec, 50°C 30 sec, 72°C 1 min) where the
annealing temperature was reduced by 1°C per cycle;
followed by 20 cycles (94°C 30 sec, 50°C 30 sec 72°C 60
sec). Part of the amplified product was checked on agarose gel. In the absence of unspecific amplified bands,
PCR products were re-amplified.
Fragments from the positive PCR reactions were purified using the QIAEX II ® Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen)
and cloned into pGEM ® -T Easy vector system (Promega). Bacterial clones (E. coli - TOP10) were checked
by PCR using the T7 (5’-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3’) and SP6 (5’-ATTTAGGTGACACTAG-3’)
primers (94°C 2 min, 35 cycles of 94°C 30 sec, 45°C

30 sec and 72°C 60 sec; followed by 5 min at 72°C). PCR
products were sequenced as described above using T7
and SP6 primers. High quality consensus sequences
were subjected to sequence similarity searches using the
blastx program against an An. gambiae protein database
built in the present work. The top BLAST hits to the
An. gambiae fbn9 gene sequence (GenBank Gi:
167861677) were considered as potential orthologs for
further analysis.
Sequence analysis

All fbn9 gene sequences obtained from An. aquasalis,
An. darlingi, An. albitarsis, and An. nuneztovari were
aligned with ClustalX [28] and manually adjusted with
BioEdit [29]. Analyses of the alignment coverage, the
presence of conserved domains, the number of singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the percentages of
synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions, and the
rates of transitions and transversions among the nucleotide sequences were performed through MEGA software
[30].
For the studies on selection pressure, another multiple
sequence alignment was built including other additional

60 fbn9 sequences from the An. gambiae complex
deposited at the GenBank and described elsewhere [13].
Analysis of the alignments in terms of dN, dS, and dN/
dS ratio were again performed with MEGA. To calculate
the frequency of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions, we applied the Nei-Gojobori method with the
Jukes-Cantor correction [31,32].
Phylogenetic analysis

For the phylogenetic analysis, a total of 21 fbn9 nucleotide sequences from 10 species have been selected that
include: four partial sequences from An. darlingi, An.
aquasalis, An. nuneztovari, and An. albitarsis (Amazon
and Rondonia, Brazil) obtained in the present work
together with other 16 sequences from six species
belonging to the An. gambiae complex (Table 1). Multiple sequences from the same species, identified as A
and B, refer to different alleles of the same specimen or
different specimens collected.
The use of nucleotide sequences was chosen due to
the high level of conservation observed in the amino
acid sequences found in our species, which would result
in less informative output. Both 5’ and 3’ ends from the

Oliveira et al. Malaria Journal 2011, 10:21
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/10/1/21

An. gambiae sequences, which were not present in our
sequences, were removed from the final alignment. The
final alignment contained 365 sites, which corresponds
to 42.9% of the An. gambiae fbn9 gene sequence.
Bayesian analysis with the Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampling method as implemented in MrBayes
(version 3.1) [33] has been performed. MCMC analyses
were run as four chains (1 cold and 3 heated chains) for
1,500,000 generations, with sampling occurring every
1000 generations and with 25% of the initial samples
discarded as “burn-in”. The General Time Reversible
(GTR) model assuming a gamma distribution with variation rate between the sites and an invariable proportion
of the sites (GTR + inv + gamma) has been adopted.
The sequence of An. nuneztovari was used as outgroup
to construct the phylogenetic tree. Support values of the
recovered trees were estimated as Bayesian posterior
probabilities (pp). Well-supported clusters with the posterior probability of at least 0.80 were considered for
data interpretation. The consensus tree was visualized
and edited in FigTree, version 1.2 [34].

Results
In the present study, partial nucleotide sequences of an
important immune-related gene (fbn9) from four neotropical anopheline mosquito species have been
obtained. Sequencing of the ITS2 region of the neotropical mosquito specimens allowed the identification of
species with higher accuracy in addition to morphological identification [21]. Further comparisons of sequences
from neotropical anophelines with publicly available
sequences from the An. gambiae complex have been
performed to apply selection pressure studies and phylogenetic analysis.

where 11.33%correspond to the first, 7.59%to the second,
and 81.01%to the third codon positions. Of the 72 polymorphic codons, 64 correspond to synonymous substitutions and eight are non-synonymous. In total, 61
transitions and 25 transversions were detected. When
the An. gambiae complex sequences were included in
the analysis, 128 nucleotide polymorphisms and 104
polymorphic codons were observed, resulting in 75
synonymous and 29 non-synonymous substitutions. A
high degree of conservation among the amino acid
sequences from anopheline mosquitoes has been found
(Figure 2).
Phylogenetic analysis

Gene cloning and sequencing

The fbn9 gene was identified through PCR in An. aquasalis, An. darlingi, An. marajoara, and An. nuneztovari
mosquitoes (Figure 1). Results were confirmed through
DNA sequencing followed by similarity searches using
blastx. All sequences matching FBN9 protein sequences
as the top hit with significant E-values and high percentage of identity (See additional file 1: Table S1).
Sequences had around 360 nucleotides, corresponding
to 42.5% of the gene, from positions 84 to 444 of the
sequence (Gi: 167861677).
For An. aquasalis, a higher molecular weight band was
detected (Figure 1) and sequenced, but no significant
sequence similarity was detected through BLAST
searches.
Sequence analysis

The analysis of the sequences obtained for the neotropical mosquito species showed 79 SNPs in 360 nucleotides,

Phylogenetic relationships among 21 partial fbn9 gene
sequences from 10 distinct anopheline species (Table 1)
were reconstructed using a Bayesian approach as
described above (Methods). The tree topology (Figure 3)
suggests the presence of two well-supported sequence
groups (pp = 1) corresponding to the African (black) and
Neotropical (green) species analyzed in the present study.
The former group includes different lineages of five species of the Gambiae complex with two lineages of An.
merus (MER562_A and MER563_A) clustered together
with other two of An. quadriannulatus (QUA16 and
QUA24-B). Other relationships in the African group are
also well-resolved considering the posterior probability
cutoff (at least 0.80) adopted in our approach.
The phylogenetic relationships among the five neotropical species (green) are strongly supported by the analysis as showed in Figure 3. The two sequences of An.
albitarsis (An. marajoara) originated from Amazon and
Rondonia, Brazil, are closely related (pp = 1) and form a

sister group with sequences of An. aquasalis and An.
nuneztovari (pp = 0.98). The An. darlingi sequence
seems to be more divergent across the Neotropical species. Further phylogenetic analysis supported the orthology prediction performed through sequence similaritybased searches aforementioned.

Discussion
The unavailability of genomes from neotropical anopheline species hamper most of the studies related to function and evolutionary aspects of important genes in
mosquitoes, which makes the use of alternative techniques the only available solution to overcome this problem. Recently, studies on differential gene expression of
the coastal malaria vector An. aquasalis, infected with
Plasmodium vivax, have been performed and three fibrinogen-related genes have been found, which differ from
fbn9 [35].
In An. gambiae, FBN9 has been known to have an
important function on the mosquito immune system,
acting as a pattern recognition receptor. Its expression
is up-regulated when mosquitoes are infected with bacteria and Plasmodium species [11]. The participation of
this protein on the mosquito’s interaction with parasites
is very important because it determines the insect’s vectorial competence [36].

This study showed the high conservation pattern present in this protein in both An. gambiae and in neotropical species belonging to the subgenus Nyssorhynchus,
suggesting that this protein might have the same function in all these species. As recently stated, fibrinogen
related proteins (FREPs), where FBN9 belongs, are part
of the basal immune surveillance of mosquitoes by
interacting with mosquito bacterial flora [11]. This may
explain this conservation as all mosquito species ubiquitously harbour bacteria.
A comparison of synonymous and nonsynonymous
substitution rates in protein coding genes provides an
important means for understanding molecular evolution
[37]. When comparing the sequences in different Anopheline species, a higher frequency of polymorphic sites
on the third base of the codon reflects the higher presence of synonymous substitutions. The results presented here are in concordance with previous work
analyzing the patterns of molecular evolution in the
fbn9 gene using 60 sequences of six species from the
Gambiae complex [13]. Here, synonymous substitutions
are in higher frequency than non-synonymous substitutions resulting in a dN/dS < 1 ratio, which corresponds
to a negative or purifying natural selective pressure, perhaps limiting alterations at protein level. This observation suggests that this region may be important to

maintaining the function and/or the structure of this
protein. Recently, Lehmann and colleagues studied four
immunity-related genes (SP14D1, GNBP, defensin, and
gambicin) in An. gambiae and found no evidence to
prove that selection was mediated by pathogens that are
transmitted to humans [38].
The indication of conserved function of the fbn9 gene
between the Gambiae complex and the Brazilian anophelines is interesting if one considers that the separation of sub-genus Cellia and Nyssorhynchus occurred
around 94 my ago, based on mtDNA analysis [39].
Further studies on the expression of fbn9 in Neotropical
mosquito species and its role during infection with Plasmodium species will provide further information on this
important immune-related gene.

Conclusions
In the present work, the fbn9 gene sequences of four
neotropical anopheline species have been compared
with their homologs in the An. gambiae complex to
gain insights into insect immunity. Sequence analysis
shows a high degree of conservation of the fbn9 gene in
all species compared and suggests that these sequences

are under negative selection pressure. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis supports the hypothesis of neotropical
anophelines (subgenus Nyssorhynchus) and African mosquitoes (subgenus Cellia) forming two well-supported
clades. The present work suggests a possible conserved
role for fbn9 in the immune response of a broader
range of anopheline species. Identification of the genes
involved in the mosquito immune response to parasite
infections shall allow the design of novel pathogen control strategies.
