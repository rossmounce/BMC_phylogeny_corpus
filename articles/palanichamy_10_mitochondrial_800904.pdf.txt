Abstract
Background: Tracing the genetic origin of central European farmer N1a lineages can provide a unique opportunity
to assess the patterns of the farming technology spread into central Europe in the human prehistory. Here, we
have chosen twelve N1a samples from modern populations which are most similar with the farmer N1a types and
performed the complete mitochondrial DNA genome sequencing analysis. To assess the genetic and
phylogeographic relationship, we performed a detailed survey of modern published N1a types from Eurasian and
African populations.
Results: The geographic origin and expansion of farmer lineages related N1a subclades have been deduced from
combined analysis of 19 complete sequences with 166 N1a haplotypes. The phylogeographic analysis revealed that
the central European farmer lineages have originated from different sources: from eastern Europe, local central
Europe, and from the Near East via southern Europe.
Conclusions: The results obtained emphasize that the arrival of central European farmer lineages did not occur via
a single demic diffusion event from the Near East at the onset of the Neolithic spread of agriculture into Europe.
Indeed these results indicate that the Neolithic transition process was more complex in central Europe and
possibly the farmer N1a lineages were a result of a ‘leapfrog’ colonization process.

Background
The emergence of farming in the Near East and its spread
to Europe is one of the most significant processes in the
evolutionary history of Europeans. The question of how
agriculture spread into Europe and associated with the
genesis of the genomes of modern Europeans has been a
subject of debate and controversy among archaeologists,
anthropologists, and geneticists. Some have argued that
agriculture was introduced in large parts of Europe by
rapid movement of immigrant farmers from the Near East
[1]. Others have postulated the indigenous development of
farming by hunter-gatherers and only minimal immigration from outside [2]. Recently researchers have taken
steps to address this issue through direct comparison of
ancient mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from European
hunter-gatherers and early farmers [3,4].

Farming practices spread across Europe after the
domestication of plants and animals in the Near East
around 12,000 years ago. Archaeologists note that the
spread of farming into central Europe was accompanied
by Linear Pottery (Linearbandkeramik - LBK) and Alfödi
Linear Pottery Culture (AVK). These early farming cultures are thought to have originated in Hungary and
Slovakia about 7,500 years ago from where they spread
rapidly as far as the Paris Basin and the Ukraine. To
assess the Neolithic female contribution and associated
farming spread into central Europe we performed a
genetic study on the farmers skeletons remains from the
LBK/AVK area. The first hypervariable segment (HV1)
of the mtDNA control sequences information obtained
from 24 out of 57 Neolithic skeletons from various
LBK/AVK locations in Germany, Austria and Hungary
belonged to typical western Eurasian haplogroups (H or
V, T, K, J, U3, and N1a). Among them, six of the farmers’ skeletons had a distinctive and rare N1a mtDNA
type. Furthermore, five of these six individuals display
different N1a haplotypes and they were widespread in

the LBK area. But today this N1a mtDNA type is very
rare (0.2%) in Europeans, suggesting that first Neolithic
farmers did not have a strong impact on the genetic
population structure of the modern European female
lineages. Thus, this study result suggests that small pioneer farming groups carried farming into new areas of
Europe and the surrounding hunter-gatherers adopted
the new culture and then outnumbered the original
farmers, diluting their N1a frequency to the low modern
value [3].
However, previous studies did not address the question whether the mtDNA N1a-lineages of the skeletons
belonged to immigrant farmers or originated from local
Mesolithic peoples who adopted the farming [5].
Recently, researchers have presented important new
data on this question by direct comparison of ancient
mtDNAs from European hunter-gatherers and early
farmer skeletons [4]. The most striking result of this
study is that the mtDNA sequences of the early farmers
were genetically distinct from the hunter-gatherers, thus
confirming the hypothesis that the first farmers were
not the descendants of local hunter-gatherers but immigrated into central Europe. Thus, it is concluded that
outside colonizers brought farming to central Europe by
a major migration event [4,6]. Furthermore, the craniometric data of the Mesolithic and Neolithic skull from
Southwest Asia and Europe also suggest that the spread
of farming into Europe was mainly due to the active dispersal of people from Southwest Asia [7].
Nevertheless, Rowley-Conwy [5] postulated the appearance of farming in Europe was not a demic “wave of
advance” from the Near East, but rather a combination of
small-step migrations, in which indigenously agriculturalised hunter-gatherers played an important role in the
spread of farming in Europe. Further, he emphasized that
the non-local mtDNA lineages of central Europe’s earliest
farmers most likely were of Greek, Balkan, or Black Sea
hunter-gatherer descent rather than of the Near East origin. In addition, both central European farmer haplotypes
and the N1a haplotypes found in the modern Europeans
were not found in the Near East region, thus suggesting
that the farmer N1a lineages may be indigenous to central Europe and less likely that they were originated from
the Near East agriculturists [8]. To clarify the inconsistency on the farmers’ origin and associated farming
spread into central Europe, more detailed examination of
farmers N1a lineages is required.
Our combined mtDNA-HV1 network analysis of
farmer and modern N1a types reveals three phylogeographic branches- European, Central Asian, and African/
South Asian. The LKB farmer skeleton individualsDerenburg 1, 3 (DEB1 & 3), Halberstadt 2 (HAL2), Flowborn 1 (FLO1), and Unterwiederstedt 5 (UWS5) types
falls into the European N1a sub-branch. The AVK

individual- Ecsegfalva 1 (ECS1) belongs to the Central
Asian sub-branch. The African/South Asian branch is
characterized by control region motif 16147G, which differs from the European and the Central Asian branches
with the 16147A variant. However, a phylogeographic
pattern based only on the HV1 sequence variation is
insufficient to reveal the detailed genetic history of European farmers. On the contrary, the advance of complete
mtDNA sequence analysis seems to be extremely useful
for maternal phylogeny of farmer individuals reconstruction and thus may shed light on their origins and genetic
history; furthermore, it helps to understand the movements of Neolithic communities across Europe in the
past.
In order to reconstruct an unambiguous phylogeny of the
farmer N1a types, 12 mtDNAs (from 2 Russia, 1 TatarRussia, 1 Kazakh- South Siberia, 1 Hungary, 1 France, 1
Italy, 2 India, and 3 European ancestry living in United
States of America) were completely sequenced and compared with 7 previously published complete mtDNA N1a
sequences. Our sampling strategy was based on the preliminary obtained data on HV1 sequence variation; in particularly samples closely related to the farmers’ N1a
haplotypes were chosen for complete mtDNA sequencing
from the variety of modern populations (further details
refer the materials and methods). Further, based on farmer
lineage subclades information obtained, we have attempted
to trace the possible areas of their origin by comparison
with all available so far data from the European, Central
Asian, Near Eastern, and South Asian populations as well
as from the Caucasus.

Results and Discussion
A tree of the 19 complete mtDNA N1a sequences is
presented in Figure 1, which includes also 7 previously
published sequences. The phylogeny reveals an early
split of African/Near East lineages with the HV1 region
variant 16147G from the European and Central Asian
lineages, which carry the 16147A variant. In addition,
later lineages share a coding region transition at nucleotide position (np) 3336, which allows the definition of
subhaplogroup N1a1. Within the subhaplogroup N1a1,
we noticed that the farmer samples - DEB1, ECS1 and
other published sequences from Arabian Peninsula,
Armenia, Egypt, and Setoland lacks the HV-1 mutation
16320. We sequenced a single mtDNA genome (sample
17, figure 1) belonging to this group and the results
have allowed us to rename N1a1 of Derenko et al. [9] as
N1a1a. Now the revised phylogenetic tree points to
3336 and 16147A as the basal mutations for N1a1 subhaplogroup, whereas transition 16320 seems to be a
characteristic mutation for a whole N1a1a. We have
named the new haplotype sequence as N1a1b. Furthermore, previously established subgroup N1a1a defined by

Figure 1 Haplogroup N1a phylogeny. The tree is rooted in macrohaplogroup N. Mutations are scored relative to the revised Cambridge
reference sequence (rCRS) [30]. The prefix “@” indicates back mutation, recurrent mutations are underlined, transversions have a base suffix, “d”
deletions and “+” insertions, and the poly(C) region in HVS1 and -2 as well as 16519 is excluded. Sequences 1-2, 7-12, 14-17, are new while
others have been previously reported [9,31-33]. Samples names are denoted by numerals and their origin is described in the material and
methods section. The central European farmer samples N1a type affinities with respective subclades are mentioned on the top of the tree.

mutations 8164, 9300, and a back mutation 2702 were
absent in the lineages 11 to 16. This suggests that 2702,
8164 and 9300 are diagnostic mutations for one of the
N1a1a subbranches which is named N1a1a1 here [10].
Finally, our new data identify two additional subclades
that have not been reported earlier, these lineages are
designated as N1a1a2 and N1a1a3 (Figure 1).
From our complete mtDNA sequences phylogeny, five
different mtDNA haplotypes were observed within the
central European farmers by Haak et al. [3] were

classified into four subhaplogroups (Figure 1). The
farmer samples DEB3 and FLO1 have an identical HV-1
motif 16147A-16172-16223-16248-16320-16355. The
results of phylogenetic analysis of complete mtDNA
sequences exactly matched to modern samples suggest
that the farmer DEB3 and FLO1 lineages might belong
to subhaplogroup N1a1a1. The exactly matched
sequence with farmer HAL2 N1a haplotype (1608616147A-16172-16223-16248-16320-16355) was observed
in modern Portuguese population from south Portugal.

Nevertheless, in combination with specific HV-2 motif
152-199-204-207, a subset of closely related sequences
was found in the modern populations and results of
complete mtDNA sequencing of some of those samples
(samples 11 and 12, Figure 1) unambiguously placed the
farmer HAL2 lineage into subhaplogroup N1a1a2. Comparing the HV-1 motif of farmer sample UWS5 with the
modern complete mtDNA sequence phylogeny (sample
15 and 16, figure 1) suggests that the farmer UWS5
lineage belong to subhaplogroup N1a1a3. Finally, farmer
lineages DEB1 and ECS1 lacking the HV1 mutation
16320 belong to N1a1b branch.
In order to obtain a detailed picture of the central
European farmers N1a lineage origin, we have performed a systematic phylogeographic survey by comparison of mtDNA sequences associated with farmer
lineages with the published modern Eurasian data set
and the results of this survey are reported in Table 1.
As seen, mtDNA sequences of subcluster N1a1a1
related to the farmer DEB3 and FLO1 lineages are
widely distributed, accounting for nearly half (82 out of
166) of the total N1a data (Table 1). Lineages from
this subcluster were observed in populations of eastern/
central Europe, Volga-Ural region, central Asia, South
Siberia, Egypt, Yemen, Iran, Turkey, and eastern/
southern India (Figure 2a) [3,9,11-16]. The cumulative
frequency of N1a1a1 reaches a maximum in eastern
Europe and central Asia, and decreases in the direction
of central and northern Europe. The same occurs in the
southern direction, towards Anatolia and the Caucasus.
Furthermore, one of the N1a1a1 subclade, N1a1a1a,
characterized by 16189 and 6641 in the HV1 and coding region is restricted to Kazakhstan, Altai and Buryat
Republic, and European part of Russian Federation
[3,9,14,16-19], and it shows significant heterogeneity
(n = 42; c2 = 125.995; d. f. 81; p < 0.001) in the haplotype distribution, attesting that these areas were a center of expansion. The calculated expansion times of
N1a1a1 and N1a1a1a were between 6,800 - 10,600 years
(Table 2). Sequences from another N1a1a2 subcluster
related to farmer HAL2 haplotype were observed in
Denmark, Poland, Scotland, Norway, Switzerland,
France, Portugal, Hungary, Austria, and Volga-Ural
region [3,19-22] (Figure 2b). This subcluster shows a
very young coalescence age between 3,400 - 4,000 years
(Table 2). Overall, the observed phylogeographic distribution of farmer lineage related subclades N1a1a1 and
N1a1a2 suggests that the ancient farmer sample DEB3,
FLO1 and HAL2 may have been associated with local
central and eastern European origin rather than with
diffusion from Near East.
The farmer UWS5 lineage associated with subclade
N1a1a3 which is widespread in Italy, Yemen, Arabian
Peninsula, Austria, Germany, Slovakia, Sweden, and

Page 4 of 10

Norway (Figure 2c) [15,20,21]. So, based on the current
distribution of subcluster N1a1a3 haplotypes, it is rather
difficult to establish the exact geographic origin of the
farmer sample UWS5. Nevertheless, the preferential distribution of this haplotype in the Near East and central/
western Europe as well as its scarce observation in eastern
Europe suggests that the lineage ancestral to UWS5 dispersed probably from the Near East through the southern
Europe and then into central/western Europe. However,
the clarification of the most likely place of origin of farmer
UWS5 lineage requires further study. The farmer lineages
ECS1 and DEB1 belong to sub-branch N1a1b which is
found in the Arabian Peninsula, Armenia, and Italy
[3,14,20,23] (Figure 2d). Thus, the presence of this lineage
in central Europe may represent a Near Eastern influence
due to both a high frequency and a high degree of diversity
of this lineage in the Arabian Peninsula.
The ancestral haplotypes to European N1a1 (haplotypes with 16147G) are more common in the Arabian
Peninsula, northern Africa [3,20,23-26], with a limited
expansion around the Iran, Israel, Turkey, Greece
[13,19,27], and are relatively rare in Europe. The coalescence time for the whole N1a haplogroup based on
synonymous mutations rates as well as coding region
estimates was between 19,600-23,500 years (Table 2).
Overall the distinct phylogeographic distribution of N1a
subclusters and their coalescence times suggests that an
initial diversification of N1a occurred in the Near East,
followed by westwards dispersion of ancestors of particular subhaplogroup to southern Europe and northwards via Central Asian steppe zones to central Europe.

Conclusions
Based on the current N1a haplogroup phylogeny and phylogeographic information on the farmer mtDNA associated subclades distribution, we suppose that the farmer
lineages-DEB3, FLO1, and HAL2 might be derived from
local communities and that they would have adopted the
farming culture indigenously. Therefore, the results of
the present study are somewhat difficult to reconcile with
the hypothesis that the N1a lineages were brought into
central Europe by the Neolithic farmers from the Near
East by a major demic diffusion event. Moreover, the evidence from phylogeographic analysis of N1a lineages
emphasizes that European farmer N1a lineages might have
been originated from different sources- from eastern Europe (for N1a1a1), from Near East via southern Europe (for
N1a1b and perhaps for N1a1a3), and from local central
European source (for N1a1a2). It is thus clear that Neolithic farmers’ migration into central Europe did not occur
in a uniform way; indeed these results indicate that the
Neolithic transition process was more complex in central
Europe and possibly the farmer N1a lineages were brought
in through the ‘leapfrog’ colonization process [5,28].

Methods
Samples collection

We collected about 3,625 blood samples from the South
Asia region, including 64 from Nepal; 47 from Bhutan;
160 from Bangladesh and 3,354 from India. All DNA
samples analyzed in the present study were derived
from the blood samples collected with informed consent
according to protocols approved by the Universities of
North Bengal, West Bengal, India. We typed the
mtDNA control region (HV-1 and HV-2) and found
three individuals (one from Tamil Nadu-South India
and other two from West Bengal-East India) which
belonged to the N1a haplogroup. Of these three N1a
individuals, two were chosen for complete mtDNA
sequences analysis (sample No. 7 and No. 8 in figure 1).
To get clear picture of the extent of farmer and published haplogroup N1a diversity, a further ten mtDNAs
were chosen for complete sequence analysis. Those samples from Russian Federation (sample No.1- Kazakh, No.
9-Tatar, and No.10 & No.16 -Russia), No.2-Hungary,
No.12-France, No.17-Italy, and No.11, 14, & 15 the
United States of America have a European ancestry.
Samples 2, 11, 12, 14, 15 and 17 were selected from the
public participant pool through preliminary control
region information that was gathered from two websites:
Mitosearch http://www.mitosearch.org/ and mtDNA test
results log database http://www.kerchner.com/cgi-bin/
mtdna.cgi. We obtained informed consent from each
participant to use their data for scientific study.
Complete mtDNA sequencing

We obtained the complete mtDNA sequences via methods
previously reported [9,29]. Sequencing was performed on
3130 and 3730 Genetic Analyzers (Applied Biosystems),
and the resulting sequences were handled with the SeqScape (v. 2.5-Applied Biosystems) and DNASTAR software
(DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, USA). Mutations were scored
relative to the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence
(rCRS) [30]. The complete mtDNA sequences of sample
No. 1, 9, 10, and 16 were obtained by Genetics laboratory,

Institute of Biological Problem of the North, Magadan,
Russia. The remaining 8 mtDNAs complete sequences
were done in the Laboratory for Conservation and Utilization of Bioresources, Yunnan University, Kunming, China.
The complete mtDNA sequences reported in this paper
have been deposited in GenBank under accession numbers
GU123026, GU290206 - GU290216 http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/Genbank/index.html.
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic relationships among the complete mtDNA
sequences were established using the reduced median
network algorithm http://www.fluxus-engineering.com
and the tree was checked manually to resolve homoplasies. In addition to our twelve complete sequences,
seven published sequences were added to establish the
N1a phylogeny (Figure 1, sample No.3, 4, 5, 18-Accession number EF153778, EF486519, EF486518, EF486517
[9]; No.13-EF657753 [31]; No. 6-EF660937 [32]; and
No.19- EF184638 [33], respectively). The tree is rooted
in haplogroup N, using the revised Cambridge reference
sequence (rCRS) [30] as an outgroup.
Phylogeographic and Coalescence analyses

To assess the farmer N1a type variation and phylogeographic relationship, we performed a detailed survey of
modern published N1a types from West, Central and
East European, the Caucasus, the Near East, and West,
Central and South Asian groups. A total of 162 (excluded
4 public participants from United States of America) N1a
haplotypes were observed and are presented in the table
1. By using a motif recognition and matching and nearmatching strategy with our current N1a subclades phylogeny, all of the published N1a haplotypes were assigned
to their respective N1a subhaplogroup. The subclade
haplotype heterogeneity was evaluated with chi-square
statistics (computer software available from http://www.
quantpsy.org). The coalescence times were estimated
with r statistics (mean divergence from inferred ancestral
haplotype), and standard errors (s) were calculated

Palanichamy et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:304
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/304

following the method of Saillard et al. [34]. Each subclade
value of r ± s was converted into time with different calibration rates as described by authors [35-39].
