Abstract
Background: Human ART4, carrier of the GPI-(glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol) anchored
Dombrock blood group antigens, is an apparently inactive member of the mammalian mono-ADPribosyltransferase (ART) family named after the enzymatic transfer of a single ADP-ribose moiety
from NAD+ to arginine residues of extracellular target proteins. All known mammalian ART4
orthologues are predicted to lack ART activity because of one or more changes in essential active
site residues that make up the R-S-EXE motif. So far, no other function has been detected.
Results: Here we report the identification and characterisation of ART4 in chicken, which to our
knowledge is the first true non-mammalian orthologue of a mammalian ART family member. The
chicken ART4 gene has the same physical structure as its mammalian counterparts (three coding
exons separated by two introns in phase 0 and phase 1, respectively) and maps to a region of
conserved linkage synteny on chromosome 1. Its mRNA encodes a 289 amino acid protein with
predicted N-terminal signal peptide and C-terminal GPI-anchor sequences and 47% sequence
identity to human ART4. However, in striking contrast to its mammalian orthologues, the chicken
protein contains an intact R-S-EXE motif. Upon ectopic expression in C-33A cells, recombinant
chicken ART4 localized at the cell surface as a GPI-anchored, highly glycosylated protein, which
displayed arginine-specific ART activity (apparent Km of the recombinant protein for etheno-NAD+
1.0 ± 0.18 μM).
Conclusion: The avian orthologue of the "acatalytic" mammalian ART4 is a mono-ADPribosyltransferase with enzymatic activity comparable to that of other, catalytically active and GPIanchored members of the mammalian ART family.

Background
ART4 is structurally related to vertebrate ecto-ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs), which covalently modify extracel-

lular substrates by transferring a single ADP-ribose residue
from NAD+ to a specific amino acid in the target protein
[1,2].

The mammalian ART family which comprises five members (ART1 – ART5) has been extensively studied in mice
and humans [3]. In contrast to humans, which lack ART2
expression due to the presence of a non-functional ART2
gene [4], two ART2 proteins are expressed in mice as a
result of gene duplication [5]. Among the five known
ARTs, only ART1, ART2 and ART5 exhibit arginine-specific
enzyme activity. ART3 and ART4 appear to have lost their
catalytic activity, most likely due to the non-conservative
substitution of residues in the R-S-EXE motif, which is typically present in the active centre of arginine-specific ARTs
[6].
So far, no evidence for a potential other function has
emerged for either of the two "acatalytic" members of the
mammalian ART family, except that human ART4 has previously been demonstrated to be identical with the polymorphic Dombrock blood group antigen expressed on
erythrocytes as GPI (glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol)anchored glycoprotein [7,8]. In addition, we and others
have shown that expression of the human ART4 gene can
be induced by lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid and
peptidoglycan in monocytes and alveolar epithelial cells
[9-11].
Given the fact that the ART2 gene locus shows considerable genetic variation even among mammalian species
(one active gene in rat, two active genes in mice versus one
pseudogene in humans [4,5,12]), we sought to employ
bioinformatic means to search for other ART4 orthologues not only in mammals but also in lower vertebrates.
A tBLASTn search, in which the amino acid sequence of
human ART4 was compared to entries in NCBI's nucleotide sequence databases dynamically translated in all
reading frames, resulted in the detection of a predicted
gene transcript in chicken that potentially encoded a protein "similar to Dombrock blood group carrier molecule".
Intriguingly, this protein contained an intact R-S-EXE
motif, which raised the possibility that it represented an
active ART enzyme. As none of the ARTs identified in
chicken so far [13,14] was evolutionary related to mammalian ARTs, it was important to verify the orthologous
relationship between the putative chicken and the human
ART4 gene, before attempting to prove the enzymatic
activity of its protein.
Here we report for the first time the existence of a GPIanchored ART4 in chicken, which, to our knowledge, represents also the first real orthologue of a member of the
mammalian ecto-ART family in a non-mammalian species. Moreover, in contrast to its mammalian ART4 orthologues, chicken ART4 displays an arginine-specific monoADP-ribosyltransferase activity.

RNA isolation and reverse transcription
Total RNA was isolated from pieces of yolk sack (14 day
old embryo, breed: Italian), from chicken bone marrow
cells (2 × 106) (breed: German White Leghorn; German
White Leghorn × Rhode Island Red) or from HD3 cells (2
× 106) using the RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. Reverse transcription was performed as described previously [9].

gels (FMC Bioproducts, Rockland, MA, U.S.A.) containing
1.25 μg/ml ethidium bromide and visualized under UV
light.
5' inverse RACE-PCR
First strand synthesis was performed with total RNA isolated from the yolk sack of a 14 day old embryo. A total of
10 μl (approx. 4 μg) was used to prepare cDNA by annealing RNA with 1 μl (100 pmol) of gene-specific primer
RT_2_chART4. After denaturation for 10 min at 70°C
reverse transcription using RevertAid™ H Minus M-MuLV
reverse transcriptase at 37°C for 60 min was performed.
An inactivation phase of 10 min at 70°C was followed by
second strand synthesis, ring ligation, and inverse nested
PCR amplification (primer pairs chART4 inverse fwd1/
RT_chART4 and chART4 inverse fwd2/chART4 inverse
rev2 as described previously [15].
3' RACE-PCR
To amplify the 3'-end of chicken ART4 mRNA from HD3
cells, 3'RACE-PCR was performed according to Frohman
et al. [16]. Briefly, 10 μl total RNA (approx. 4 μg) were
reverse transcribed for 60 min at 37°C using RevertAid™
H Minus M-MuLV reverse transcriptase and the RT-RACEchick primer. Nested PCR (40 cycles) was performed
using an adaptor-specific primer (RACE reverse II) and
different forward primers (3'UTR fwd2, 3'UTR fwd3, and
3'UTR fwd4). PCR products were diluted 1:10 prior to the
next PCR step.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Different organs (lung, bone marrow, thymus, spleen,
caecum, liver, bursa of Fabricius) from five-day-old
chicken were stored in RNA-later (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) until use. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and contaminating DNA was
digested using the RNase-free DNase Set (Qiagen). RNA
was eluted in 50 μl RNase-free water per 20 mg tissue,
stored and analysed by spectral analysis (BioPhotometer,
Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Only samples with
mRNA purity of about 2 (ratio E260/280) or above 2
(E260/230) were used. The quantity of mRNA was
adjusted and the mRNA expression rates of ART4 (chA4
realtime3/chA4 realtime5) and GAPDH (GAPDH fwd/
GAPDH rev) was determined for each bird using the
QuantiTect™ SYBR® Green one-step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen).
Amplification and detection of specific products were performed on a Mx3000P™ real-time PCR equipment (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the following temperature-time
profile: one cycle at 50°C for 30 min, 96°C for 15 min,
and 45 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s followed by
72°C for 30 s. To check the specificity of amplification
products, the dissociation curve mode was used (one cycle
at 95°C for 1 min, 55°C for 30 s and 95°C for 30 s) subsequent to amplification and the amplicons were
sequenced. Final quantification was done using the comparative Ct-method and reported as relative gene expression to cDNA from bone marrow (calibrator). The
threshold cycle number (Ct) was calculated and the levels
of chicken ART4 expression were normalized to GAPDH
using the formula 2-ΔΔCt in which ΔΔCt = ΔCt (sample) ΔCt (calibrator) with ΔCt as difference between Ct of target gene (chicken ART4) and Ct of housekeeping gene
(GAPDH).
Cloning and sequencing of PCR products
PCR products were excised from agarose gels. The fragments were cloned using the TOPO TA cloning kit or the
CloneJET™PCR Cloning kit according to the manufacturer's instruction. Plasmid DNA was purified using a
GFX™ Micro Plasmid Prep Kit (Amersham Biosciences,
Munich, Germany) and sequenced on both strands.
Construction of a chicken ART4 expression plasmid
DNA from 1 × 107 chicken bone marrow cells (German
White Leghorn × Rhode Island Red) was isolated using
standard procedures. The coding sequence of chicken
ART4 was amplified using genomic DNA from chicken
bone marrow cells with primers derived from [GenBank:
AADN01052179]. PCRs were carried out using the High
Fidelity PCR Enzyme Mix with primers amplifying the
coding sequence of exon2 (fwd: 5'-GAC GAT GAC AAG

TCG AGT CAT TGC TTG GCC AAG CAC-3'). The resulting
PCR products (the sequences that are underlined represent complementary regions) were fused in a second PCR
reaction using the following primer pair (fwd: 5'-TTG GTA
CCG ACT ACA AGG ACG ACG ATG A-3' and rev: 5'-GAC
TCG AGT CAT TGC TTG GCC AAG CAC-3') and the High
Fidelity PCR Enzyme Mix. The chicken ART4 N-terminal
signal peptide was exchanged by the Flag-tag (DYKDDDDK) (sequences of the primers that encode the Flagtag are highlighted in italics). The resulting PCR product
was purified and used for Acc65I/XhoI cloning into the
pSecTagB plasmid. The construct-encoded chicken ART4
protein sequence was identical to the predicted protein
sequence of [GenBank: XM425453.1] except for a F267L
polymorphism.
The
polymorphism
([GenBank:
EU056570]) was located within the GPI-anchor signal
peptide and should have no effect on the mature protein.
Site-directed mutagenesis of human ART4
Following oligonucleotides were used to mutate the Y-SKKE motif: Y187R_for 5'-GAG GTG CAT AGG AGG ACG
AAG GAT-3' and Y187R_rev 5'-ATC CTT CGT CCT CCT
ATG CAC CTC-3' for exchanging the tyrosine187 by an

GTC TTG-3' and K242E_rev 5'-CAA GAC TTC CTT CTC
GAG GGA GAA G-3' for exchanging the lysine242 by a

template (20 cycles at 57°C) and the following primer
combinations: 1) Y187R_for and Expr_rev [10]; 2)
K242E_for and Expr_rev; 3) Expr_3 [10] and Y187R_rev;
4) Expr_3 and K242E_rev. The products were separated on
agarose gels, excised, and extracted from the gels. A second
PCR was performed (20 cycles, 54°C) using the PCR
products from combination 1 and 3 or combination 2
and 4 as templates together with Expr_3 and Expr_rev as
primer. The resulting PCR products were cloned into the
pcDNA3.1/Zeo (+) plasmid as described [10]. For each
mutagenesis the insert was sequenced to verify the mutation and to exclude the presence of other mutations.
Treatment of C-33A cells with bacterial phospholipase C
C-33A cells (4 × 107/ml) transfected with the chicken
ART4 containing plasmid or the empty plasmid
(pSecTagB) were suspended in PBS containing 5 U/ml
Bacillus cereus phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (Invitrogen GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany)
and incubated for 60 min at 37°C. Cells were washed
three times prior to the detection of chicken ART by flow
cytometry as described below.
Treatment of chicken ART4 with PNGase F
The supernatant of PI-PLC-treated C-33A cells transfected
with a chicken ART4 containing plasmid was incubated in

the presence or absence of PNGase F (20000 U/ml)
according to the manufacturer's instruction.
Expression of soluble, recombinant chicken ART4
An N-terminal Flag-tagged chicken ART4 (amino acids 20
– 270) was cloned (Asp718I/XhoI) into the pSecTagB plasmid. HEK-293T cells were stably transfected with the plasmid and grown in serum-free Panserin PX40 medium
(PAN-Biotech GmbH, Aidenbach, Germany) at 37°C and
10% CO2. After 3 – 4 days the supernatant was exchanged
by fresh medium and purified using the Anti-Flag® M2
affinity gel according to the manufacturer instructions.
Fractions (1 ml) were lyophilized, reconstituted in 100 μl
aqua dest., combined and dialyzed against PBS.

This crude purified recombinant chicken ART4 was used
for the ADP-ribosylation filter assay.
Determination of Km values
After incubating recombinant chART4 in the presence or
absence of PNGase F (20000 U/ml) for 1 h, ADP-ribosyltransferase activity was measured. The reaction mixture
contained PBS (pH 7.4), poly-L-arginine (1 mg/ml),
chART4 (7 μg/ml) and etheno-NAD+ (0.5, 1, 2, and 5
μM). Controls were run in the absence of chART4. The
reaction was started by the addition of etheno-NAD+, and
cleavage of etheno-NAD+ was measured after 0.5, 1.5, 2.5,
3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30 min in the
Fluorolog 3 spectrophotometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon
GmbH, Munich, Germany) The excitation wavelength
was 310 nm and the emission was recorded at 403 nm.
The fluorescence intensity was expressed as photons per
second (CPS).
ADP-ribosylation filter assay
The assay was performed in a total of 100 μl reaction mixture containing PBS (pH 7.4), 1 mM ADP-ribose, 50 μM
[32P]-NAD+ (10 μCi/assay) in the presence or absence of
100 μg poly-L-arginine and recombinant chicken ART4
(0.7 μg) for 30 min at 37°C. The reactions were terminated by adding 50 μl of ice-cold BSA (5 mg/ml) followed
by 1.2 ml 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. After 45 min at
4°C the resulting precipitates were recovered by centrifugation (10 min at 3000 × g). The pellets were resuspended
in 250 μl of 2 M KOH, precipitated again and collected on
Whatman GF/C glass-fibre filters. After washing, filters
were counted by liquid scintillation spectrometry.
Treatment of cells with etheno-NAD+
Cells (1 × 107/ml) were incubated in PBS for 30 min at
37°C with 200 μM of etheno-NAD+. After adding a 20fold volume of PBS cells were washed three times before
performing FACS- or Western Blot analysis.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/86

Antibodies and FACS analysis
The anti-Flag M2 antibody, IgG1 and IgG2a isotype control antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich. The anti ethenoadenosine specific antibody 1G4 (IgG2a) [17] was kindly
provided by Dr. Friedrich Koch-Nolte (University Hospital Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Cells were incubated
with the respective mAbs for 30 min at 4°C. After washing
in PBS containing 10% Haemaccel® (Hoechst, Frankfurt,
Germany), and 0.1% sodium azide they were incubated
for 30 min at 4°C with FITC-labelled goat-anti-mouse
antibody (SIFIN, Berlin, Germany). After washing and fixation in 1% formaldehyde, cells were analysed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA,
U.S.A.).
Western Blot analysis
Western Blot analysis was carried out as described previously [18]. Cells (1.5 × 107/ml) were suspended in lysis
buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v)
NP-40, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS (w/v) and
cOmplete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Mannheim,
Germany)) and sonicated. Samples were run on a 12%
SDS-polyacrylamid gel (MiniProtean II, BioRad GmbH)
and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes
(Amersham Biosciences, Munich, Germany). Membranes
were probed with an anti-Flag M2 antibody (10 μg/ml),
1G4 antibody (1/500) or anti-β-actin antibody (1/5000;
clone AC-74, Sigma-Aldrich) and detected with a PODconjugated goat anti-mouse (1/20000 Sigma-Aldrich) secondary antibody using the Western Blotting Luminol Reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, U.S.A.)
detection system.
Data analysis
Following programs were used: the standard nucleotidenucleotide BLAST [blastn] program [19] to screen the
database of expressed sequence tags (dbEST) and the
tBLASTn program to search translated nucleotide database
using a protein query [20], SIM4 software [21] to align
cDNA sequences with the genomic DNA sequence, CLUSTAL W software [22] for multiple amino acid alignment,
and both SignalP 3.0 [23] and GPI-SOM [24] program for
prediction of cellular localization and membrane anchorage, respectively.

Results
Identification of an ART4-related gene in chicken
In order to locate ART4-related genes in species other than
mammals, we made use of the tBLASTn program, which
compares a protein query sequence to nucleotide
sequences dynamically translated in all six reading frames.
A search of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) "nr" nucleotide database with the human
or mouse ART4 protein sequence uncovered a putative
chicken gene transcript of 870 nucleotides that translated

into a 289 amino acid protein "similar to Dombrock
blood group carrier molecule" ([GenBank: XM425453.1
GI:50729203, VRT 28-JUL-2004]). This record had been
generated by "automated computational analysis" of a
genomic contig ([GenBank: NW001471513]) on chicken
chromosome 1, which resulted in the prediction of an
ART4-related gene composed of three coding exons. As in
mammalian ART4 genes, the second exon encoded the
major part of the protein, but different from the situation
in mammals, it also coded for an intact R-S-EXE motif
indicative of a functional catalytic domain of an argininespecific ADP-ribosyltransferase [6]. Incidentally, [GenBank: XM425453.1] was since removed from the "nr"
database and on 06-Nov-2006 replaced by [GenBank:
XM425453.2 GI:118082577]. (The protein encoded by
the latter transcript differs at its C-terminus from the earlier version, because the new gene prediction lacks the
third exon. As a consequence, the open reading frame in
ex2 ends shortly after the ex2-intron2 junction predicted
in the first record. Thus, [GenBank: XM425453.2] could
reflect a splice variant.) To substantiate the presence of an
active ART4-related gene in chicken, RT-PCR was performed on total RNA from HD3 cells (a chicken erythroblast cell line) with primers, designed to amplify the
complete coding and additional flanking sequences of the
trancript shown in [GenBank: XM425453.1]. A weak PCRproduct of approx. 950 base pairs was obtained (data not

shown, [GenBank: EU269858]). It corresponded to the
transcript predicted in the original [GenBank:
XM425453.1] entry, thus, verifying the existence of an
avian ART gene with three coding exons as found in mammalian ART4 genes. Using the BLASTP program [25] to
compare the amino acid sequence of the chicken protein
with that of each member of the ART family in men and
mice, the highest degree of sequence identity exhibited
the ART4 orthologues, with 47% identity and 65% similarity between chicken and human or 45% identity and
64% similarity between chicken and mouse (Fig. 1). Figure 2A shows the actual amino acid sequence alignment
of the putative chicken ART4 with its presumed counterparts in mouse and man. As noted before, only the
chicken protein contains an intact R-S-EXE motif. Note
that in all three ARTs the X within the EXE tripeptide is a
lysine (K).
Phylogentic relatedness of ART4 in chicken and mammals
Having demonstrated the existence of an apparently
ART4-related gene in the chicken genome, we wanted to
establish its phylogenetic relatedness with mammalian
genes by analysing its location on chromosome 1 with
respect to the presence and order of genes surrounding it.
Employing NCBI's map viewer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/mapview/ and tBLASTn searches revealed that the
chicken gene mapped to a region syntenic to the portion

Amino acid sequence alignment of ART4 from men, mice and chicken
Amino acid sequence alignment of ART4 from men, mice and chicken. A) The deposited amino acid sequences from
human ([GenBank: NM021071]), mouse ([GenBank: NM026639.2]) and chicken ART4 ([GenBank: XM425453.1]) were aligned
using the CLUSTAL W (1.83) multiple sequence alignment program [22]. Residues corresponding to the R-S-EXE motif are
shown in grey. Residues that differ from this motif are highlighted in white on black background. The numbering of the amino
acids indicates the position of the single amino acids within the respective ART. Boxes indicate putative RGD sequence motifs
(solid lines) or stretches of residues that are highly conserved among ARTs (broken lines). " * " marks residues that are identical in all sequences; " : " marks conserved substitutions and " . " marks semi-conserved substitutions. B) Comparison of the
human and chicken ART4 loci. The genes are depicted as arrows with the ART4 genes shown as filled arrows. The gene order
at the human and chicken loci was obtained from the NCBI map viewer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/

on human chromosome 12, which harbours the human
ART4 gene (Fig. 2B). The analysed 83-kb Gallus gallus
locus comprises seven genes in addition to ART4. Six of
these genes were also found surrounding the human ART4
locus, whereas the gene (BGP) directly upstream of
chicken ART4 had no human counterpart (Fig. 2B). The
data presented so far strongly suggest that the predicted
chicken gene is orthologous to mammalian ART4 genes.
Analysis of the 5' and 3' untranslated region
To analyse the 5' end of the chicken ART4 mRNA we performed 5' inverse RACE-PCR on RNA derived from yolk
sack. Among the respective PCR products we obtained a
product of 422 bp (data not shown). According to the
sequence analysis of the product ([GenBank: EF626644])
which includes exon 1 and parts of exon 2 the 5' UTR consists of 206 bp.

The 3' UTR of the chicken ART4 mRNA was analysed by
applying 3' inverse RACE-PCR [26] or 3' RACE-PCR [16]
on mRNA from HD3 cells using primers derived from the
predicted ART4 sequence. As no ART4 specific transcripts
were obtained, possibly due to the length of the products
we applied conventional RT-PCR analysis to amplify
ART4 mRNA reaching into the 3' UTR as far as possible.
We obtained a PCR product ([GenBank: EU048538]) of
2199 bp (data not shown) consisting mainly of exon 3
and to a minor extent of exon 2. It contains three obviously unused polyadenylation signals. In a subsequent 3'
RACE-PCR analysis using primers derived from the above
described PCR product we detected a transcript (GenBank:
EU048537]), representing the 3' end of the chicken ART4
mRNA.
Figure 3A combines the genomic DNA and cDNA
sequences ([GenBank: EF626644, EU048538, EU048537,
and XM425453.1]) to depict the chicken ART4 mRNA. It
shows that chicken ART4, as predicted by computer prediction programs [23,24], contains N- and C-terminal signal peptides, characteristic of extracellular GPI-anchored
membrane proteins. The derived chicken ART4 gene structure is shown in Figure 3B.
Chicken ART4 is a GPI-anchored and glycosylated protein
C-33A cells were stably transfected with an expression
plasmid containing the sequence of ART4 encoding
amino acids 20–289. As shown by FACS analysis about
30% of the stably transfected cells were fluorescence positive (Fig. 4A). Treatment with PI-PLC resulted in a significant decrease from 30% to 9.4% positive cells, indicating
the existence of a GPI-anchored protein. Proteins of the
supernatant of the PI-PLC treated C-33A cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and ART4 was detected by Western
Blot analysis. The apparent molecular weight was 40 kDa,
about 10 kDa higher than predicted (Fig. 4B). As chicken

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/86

ART4 contains five potential N-glycosylation sites we
tested whether the higher mass could be due to glycosylation of the protein. We incubated the chicken ART4 containing supernatant with PNGase F, an enzyme that
cleaves the amide bonds between GlcNAc and asparagine
residues of N-linked glycoproteins [27]. The molecular
weight of ART4 detected in the supernatant by Western
Blot analysis was about 10 kDa lower than the untreated
protein (Fig. 4C), indicating the presence of asparaginelinked glycosyl moieties on chicken ART4. After having
probed the membrane with the anti-Flag M2 antibody,
the membrane was stained with Ponceau S. As seen in figure 4D there was hardly any difference between the
molecular weight of chicken ART4 and PNGase F. However, the anti-Flag antibody only detected chicken ART4 so
that any unspecific binding of the antibody to PNGase F
can be excluded.
Chicken ART4 is enzymatically active
In contrast to human ART4 the chicken ART4 contains the
R-S-EXE motif, a characteristic for arginine-specific ARTs
[6]. ART4 activity was measured by incubating ART4
transfected C-33A cells with etheno-NAD+, an analogue of
NAD+. Etheno-NAD+ can be used as an alternative substrate to monitor etheno-ADP-ribosylation of cell surface
proteins. The etheno-ADP-ribosylated proteins were visualized by flow cytometry using an etheno-adenosine specific antibody (1G4) [28]. As shown in Figure 5, transient
transfection of C-33A cells with chicken ART4 leads to an
ADP-ribosylation of cell surface proteins (Fig. 5A, C).
Transfection efficiency was monitored by staining the cells
with an anti-Flag antibody (Fig. 5B, D). About 14% of the
cells were ART4 positive and about 18% carried ADP-ribosylated proteins. As seen in Figure 5E ADP-ribosylated
proteins are also detectable on chicken erythrocytes indicating that ADP-ribosylation is not only mediated by
recombinant ART4 but also occurs endogenously.

To characterize the nature of the linkage between ADPribose and amino acid side chains cells were incubated in
the presence of etheno-NAD+. Cell lysates were prepared
and incubated under conditions known to cleave specifically the linkage of ADP-ribose to thiol groups (10 mM
HgCl2), or to arginine (1 M NH2OH, pH 7.0) [29,30].
SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using the
1G4 antibody [28] revealed that detection by the antibody
was not influenced by treatment with 1 M NaCl (Fig. 6A,
lane 2) and 10 mM HgCl2 (lane 4) but was abolished in
the presence of 1 M NH2OH (lane 3) strongly suggesting
that chicken ART4-catalyzed mono-ADP-ribosylation
occurred at arginine residues. As a loading control, the
membranes were stripped and reprobed with a β-actin
specific antibody (Fig. 6B).

Figure 4 of chicken ART4 transfected C-33A cells with PI-PLC and PNGase F
Treatment
Treatment of chicken ART4 transfected C-33A cells with PI-PLC and PNGase F. A) C-33A cells (4 × 107/ml) transfected with the chicken ART4 containing plasmid or the empty plasmid (pSecTag B) were stained with the anti-Flag antibody
(black bar) or the isotype control (white bar) after being incubated for 1 h at 37°C in the presence or absence of PI-PLC (5 U/
ml). Data show the mean of % positive cells ± S.E.M. of three experiments. ** p = 0.007 (Student's t-test) B) Western blot analysis using the anti-Flag antibody was performed with supernatants of chicken ART4 transfected C-33A cells after incubation in
the presence or absence of PI-PLC. Data show one representative experiment out of three. C) The supernatant of chicken
ART4 transfected cells was incubated for 1 h in the presence or absence of PNGase F (20000 U/ml) at 37°C. PNGase F alone
was run as a control. After boiling the samples in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, Western blot analysis using the anti-Flag antibody
were carried out. The membrane was stained with Ponceau S (D). Similar results were obtained in three separate experiments.

To verify that arginine-residues were modified by chicken
ART4, ADP-ribosylation of poly-L-arginine was determined by incubating chicken ART4 in the presence of
[32P]-NAD+, ADP-ribose and poly-L-arginine. ADP-ribose
was added to minimize the contribution of the non-enzymatic addition of free [32P]-ADP-ribose to poly-Larginine.

The finding that radioactivity was incorporated in poly-Larginine (Fig. 7) demonstrates that ART4 catalyzed monoADP-ribosylation occurred at arginine residues.
To further characterize chicken ART4 the Km value of the
enzyme was determined. Recombinant chART4 was used
for time- and dose-dependent determinations of enzy-

ADP-ribosylation of poly-L-arginine
ADP-ribosylation of poly-L-arginine. Recombinant
chicken ART4 (0.7 μg) was incubated in 100 μl PBS containing 1 mM ADP-ribose, 50 μM [32P]-NAD+ (10 μCi/assay) in
the presence or absence of poly-L-arginine (1 mg/ml) for 30
min at 37°C. After incubation the samples were precipitated
and collected on Whatman glass-fibre filters as described in
the materials and methods. Incorporated radioactivity was
measured by liquid scintillation counting. Data show the
mean ± S.D. (n = 3).

Mutation of the active site motif of human ART4
To test whether human ART4 containing an R-S-EXE motif
is enzymatically active three mutant proteins were constructed and tested for ADP-ribosyltransferase activity
using etheno-NAD+ as substrate. Expression plasmids
were generated which encoded for the wildtype ART4, an
Y187R mutant, a K242E mutant, and an Y187R, K242E
double mutant containing the R-S-EXE motif. C-33A cells
were stably transfected with the plasmids and those cells
carrying either the wildtype ART4, the single mutants or
the double mutant were enriched by cell sorting (more
than 90% positive cells) and used for further analyses.
FACS-analysis revealed that neither the mutants carrying a
single amino acid exchange nor the double mutant (R-SEXE) displayed any enzyme activity (data not shown).
Obviously additional residues besides the intact R-S-EXE
motif are involved in catalyzing the enzymatic reaction.

Tissue distribution of chicken ART4
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of chicken tissues
revealed that the highest amount of chicken ART4 mRNA
was present in spleen, liver and bone marrow, while in
thymus, bursa of Fabricius, and caecum it was hardly
detected. No mRNA was detected in lung (Fig. 9).

Discussion
Whereas most studies have focussed on ART genes and
activity in mammals expression of ARTs has also been
demonstrated in chicken. Chicken contain both soluble
ARTs (ART6.1 and ART6.2) and GPI-anchored ARTs
(cgART1 and cgART2). The nucleotide sequence of cgART2
was found to be identical with that of ART7 (ART7.2) and
the cDNA of cgART1 encoded a polypeptide which represents an ART7 homologue (ART7.1) [31]. The GPIanchored ARTs showed different enzymatic properties
than soluble ARTs and the tissue distribution of cgART1
and cgART2 revealed distinct expression patterns [31].
Besides ART6 and ART7 no other ARTs have been identified in chicken so far. Here we show that apart from ART6
and ART7 chicken also express a non chicken-specific
ART.
We describe the cloning and characterization of the ART4
(or DO) gene from Gallus gallus. Several lines of evidence,

Real-time RT-PCR analysis of chicken ART4 mRNA expresReal-time RT-PCR analysis of chicken ART4 mRNA
expression in different tissues. The mRNA was isolated
and mRNA levels of chicken ART4 were measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Levels were standardized to the
expression of GAPDH and mRNA concentrations from bone
marrow were set as the 100% reference. Data show the
mean ± S.D. of relative mRNA levels of two individual animals. n.d.: not detectable

such as conserved synteny, similar exon-intron structure,
and conserved residues show that the gene cloned is the
Gallus gallus orthologue of the human ART4 gene. The predicted chicken ART4 amino acid sequence only shares
47% and 45% identity (65% and 64% similarity) to
human and mouse ART4 respectively and among mammals ART4 also appears to be quite divergent with an
identity between human and mouse ART4 of 63% (75%
similarity). Thus the coding sequence of ART4 appears to
be evolving rapidly. Residues that are conserved during
evolution in such a rapidly evolving gene or gene family
are likely to be important for the function of the protein.
The amino acid sequence alignment of ART4 from
chicken, men, and mice uncovered several stretches of residues that are highly conserved, most strikingly the
S30FDDQY35 and K218EVLIPPYE226 residues (Fig. 2A).
Parts of these sequences namely the FDD and EVLIP
motifs are also strictly conserved within other members of
the ART family. The FDD sequence motif is located in the
N-terminus of the ARTs whereas the EVLIP stretch resides
in the 5th of the six conserved β-strands that make up part
of the core features of the ART fold in the catalytic
domain. Moreover a lysine residue (K) directly upstream

BMC Molecular Biology 2008, 9:86

of the catalytic E in the EXE motif is found in ART4 of men
(KKE244), mice (RKE223), and chicken (EKE219) but not in
the EXE motif of other mammalian ARTs [6].
Another common feature of the chicken and human ART4
gene is their genomic organization. Almost the complete
mature protein is encoded by exon 2, one of the three
exons that besides two introns make up the ART4 gene
[10]. Unlike human ART4 mRNA the 3' UTR of the
chicken ART4 mRNA comprises 2145 bp. Due to this
length the chicken ART4 gene overlaps with a hypothetical gene ([GenBank: XM416185]) located on the opposite
DNA strand.
The tissue distribution of chicken ART4 mRNA expression
is in part similar to that of human ART4 mRNA [6,7]. Haematological tissues including human fetal liver and
human and chicken bone marrow and spleen seem to be
preferential sites of ART4 mRNA expression. Furthermore,
the fact that HEL cells, a human erythroleukaemia cell line
[10] and human erythrocytes carry the ART4 protein and
that ART4 mRNA is present in chicken erythrocytes (data
not shown) may point to a role of ART4 in haematopoiesis in higher vertebrates.
GPI-anchoring of the chicken ART4 to the membrane was
shown by PI-PLC sensitivity. Treatment of chicken ART4
transfected C-33A cells with the enzyme led to the appearance of a 40 kDa protein (Fig. 4B) whose molecular
weight was higher than that predicted for chicken ART4
(29 kDa) lacking the N- and C-terminal signal peptides.
The decrease in molecular weight after the exposure to
PNGase F strongly suggests that the chicken ART4 is glycosylated. In fact there are five predicted N-glycosylation
sites in the amino acid sequence (Fig. 3A).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/9/86

We show that chicken ART4 contains residues corresponding to the R-S-EXE active site motif of arginine-specific ARTs [6] and that it displays arginine-specific enzyme
activity while human ART4 shows nonconservative amino
acid deviations in this motif. Furthermore, according to
the CLUSTAL W amino acid sequence alignment human
and mouse ART4 not only deviate in the glutamic acid (E)
two residues upstream of the catalytic glutamic acid (E) of
the R-S-EXE motif but also in the arginine (R) which is
replaced by histidine (H) in mouse and tyrosine (Y) in
men (Fig. 2A).
Considering the importance of the R-S-EXE motif in the
catalytic core of all arginine modifying ARTs we
exchanged two amino acids of the human ART4 Y-S-KXE
motif to obtain an intact R-S-EXE motif. Surprisingly C33A cells expressing human ART4 with the R-S-EXE motif
did not display any enzyme activity. Obviously the mere
presence of the correct motif in ART4 is not sufficient to
turn the protein into an active enzyme. Further mutational studies are necessary to identify additional amino
acid residues essential for restoring a functional catalytic
core.
It is conceivable that the common ancestor of birds and
mammals possesses an enzymatically active ART4 and
that the loss of enzyme activity of human ART4 may have
arisen due to some evolutionary advantages.
Having cloned and characterized an enzymatically active
ART4 orthologue we have provided important experimental tools to elucidate the functional role of ART4. Knowledge of such function in turn may help to explain the loss
of ART4 enzyme activity in mammals during evolution.

Conclusion
Determination of the apparent Km for etheno-NAD+ of
recombinant chicken ART4 revealed a value of 1.0 μM. It
is similar to the Km (3 μM) for etheno-NAD+ of ART2.2
expressed on DC27.10 cells [28] but it differs from the Km
values for recombinant ART7.2 (130 μM) [32] another
ART found in chicken and Pseudomonas aeruginosa toxin A
(275 μM) [33].
Interestingly, both human and chicken ART4 contain an
RGD sequence motif. This sequence (Arg-Gly-Asp) found
in various adhesive proteins (fibronectin, vitronectin,
fibrinogen, and Willebrand factor) serves as a cell attachment site [34]. In chicken the motif (RGD50) is found in
the N-terminal part of ART4 whereas in humans an
RGD265 motif is located in the C-terminus that aligns to
the chicken RGN240. In case ART4 should display adhesive
properties it would be of interest in how far the cell recognition signal Arg-Gly-Asp is involved in it.

Mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs) catalyze the transfer of a single ADP-ribose moiety of NAD+ to a specific
amino acid in a target protein. Mammalian ARTs consist
of five members (ART1 – 5) two of them ART3 and ART4
being enzymatically inactive, unlike the active members
they do not contain the R-S-EXE motif in the catalytic
domain typical of arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases. Here we identified the chicken ART4 as the first
real orthologue of a member of the mammalian ARTs in a
non-mammalian species. In contrast to the mammalian
ART4 the chicken ART4 contains an intact R-S-EXE motif
and exhibits the predicted enzyme activity. Thus, ART4 is
the first ADP-ribosyltransferase which displays different
biochemical properties in two higher vertebrate classes.
