Abstract
Background/Aim: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been the subject of intense research and clinical
investigation as its major role in human disease has emerged. Although homologous recombination
has been demonstrated in many members of the family Flaviviridae, to which HCV belongs, there
have been few studies reporting recombination on natural populations of HCV. Recombination
break-points have been identified in non structural proteins of the HCV genome. Given the
implications that recombination has for RNA virus evolution, it is clearly important to determine
the extent to which recombination plays a role in HCV evolution. In order to gain insight into these
matters, we have performed a phylogenetic analysis of 89 full-length HCV strains from all types and
sub-types, isolated all over the world, in order to detect possible recombination events.
Method: Putative recombinant sequences were identified with the use of SimPlot program.
Recombination events were confirmed by bootscaning, using putative recombinant sequence as a
query.
Results: Two crossing over events were identified in the E1/E2 structural region of an intra-typic
(1a/1c) recombinant strain.
Conclusion: Only one of 89 full-length strains studied resulted to be a recombinant HCV strain,
revealing that homologous recombination does not play an extensive roll in HCV evolution.
Nevertheless, this mechanism can not be denied as a source for generating genetic diversity in
natural populations of HCV, since a new intra-typic recombinant strain was found. Moreover, the
recombination break-points were found in the structural region of the HCV genome.

Background
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is estimated to infect 170 million
people worldwide and creates a huge disease burden from
chronic, progressive liver disease [1]. HCV has become a
major cause of liver cancer and one of the commonest
indications of liver transplantation [2,3]. HCV has been
classified in the family Flaviviridae, although it differs

from other members of the family in many details of its
genome organization from the original (vector-borne)
members of the family [1]. Like most RNA viruses, HCV
circulates in vivo as a complex population of different but
closely related viral variants, commonly referred to as a
quasispecies [4-7].

HCV is an enveloped virus with an RNA genome of
approximately 9400 bp in length. Most of the genome
forms a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes
three structural (core, E1, E2) and seven non-structural
(p7, NS2-NS5B) proteins. Short unstranslated regions at
each end of the genome (5'NCR and 3'NCR) are required
for replication of the genome. This process also requires a
cis-acting replication element in the coding sequence of
NS5B recently described [8]. Translation of the single ORF
is dependent on an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) in
the 5'NCR, which interacts directly with the 40S ribosomal subunit during translation initiation [9].
Comparison of nucleotide sequences of variants recovered from different individuals and geographical regions
has revealed the existence of at least six major genetic
groups [1,10-12]. On the average over the complete
genome, these differ in 30–35% of nucleotide sites. Each
of the six major genetic groups of HCV contains a series of
more closely related sub-types that typically differ from
each other by 20–25 % in nucleotide sequences [12].
Different genotypes and sub-types seem to correlate differently for susceptibility to treatment with interferon (IFN)
monotherapy or IFN/ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy. Only 10–20 % and 40–50 % of individuals infected
chronically with genotype 1 HCV on monotherapy and
combination therapy, respectively, exhibit complete and
permanent clearance of virus infection. These rates are
much lower than the rates of 50 and 70–80 % that are
observed on treatment of HCV genotype 2 or 3 infections
[3,13].
Until 1999, there was no evidence for recombination in
members of the family Flaviviridae, although the possibility was considered [14-16]. Accordingly, the vast majority
of work on members of this family, including vaccine
studies and phylogenetic analyses in which genotypes
were identified and sometimes correlated with disease
severity, has rested on the implicit assumption that evolution in the family Flaviviridae is clonal, with diversity generated through the accumulation of mutational changes
[17-19].
This assumption have shown to be invalid, as homologous recombination has been demonstrated in pestiviruses,(bovine viral diarrhoea virus) [20], flaviviruses (all
four serotypes of dengue virus) [21-24], hepaciviruses (GB
virus C/hepatitis G virus) [25], Japanese encephalitis or St
Louis encephalitis virus [26].
Recombination plays a significant role in the evolution of
RNA viruses by creating genetic variation. For example,
the frequent recovery of poliovirus that result from recom-

bination has the potential to produce "escape mutants" in
nature as well as in experiments [27].
Recombination has also been detected in other RNA
viruses for which multivalent vaccines are in use or in trials [21,24,28]. The potential for recombination to produce new pathogenic hybrid strains needs to be carefully
considered whenever vaccines are used or planned to control RNA viruses. Assumptions that recombination either
does not take place or is unimportant in RNA viruses have
a history of being proved wrong [24].
Recently, a natural intergenotypic recombinant (2k/1b) of
HCV has been identified in Saint Petersburg (Russia)
[29,30]. Phylogenetic analyses of HCV strains circulating
in Peru, demonstrated the existence of natural intra-genotypic HCV recombinant strains (1a/1b) circulating in the
Peruvian population [31].
Given the implications that recombination has for RNA
virus evolution [24], it is clearly important to determine
the extent to which recombination plays a role in HCV
evolution.

Results
Phylogenetic profile analysis of full-length HCV strains
To gain insight into possible recombination events, a phylogenetic profile analysis was carried out using 89 fulllength genome sequences from HCV isolates of all types
and sub-types (for strain names, accession numbers and
genotypes, see Table 1). This was done by the use of the
SimPlot program [32]. Interesting, when the analysis was
carried out for strain D10749 (sub-type 1A), two different
recombination points (detected at positions 1407 and
2050 of alignment) and two putative parental-like strains
(AF511949, sub-type 1A and AY651061, sub-type 1C) are
observed (see Fig. 1).

In order to confirm these results, the same sequences were
used for a bootscanning study. The basic principle of
bootscanning is that mosaicism is suggested when one
observes high levels of phylogenetic relatedness between
a query sequence and more than one reference sequence
in different genomic regions [33]. When strain D10749 is
used as a query, this is observed for this strain and the two
putative parental-like strains previously detected (see Fig.
2). The same positions are also observed for the same
recombination break-points detected in the similarity
index study (see Figs. 1 and 2).
Profiles of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions
among parental-like and recombinant HCV strains
To gain insight into how the recombination events may
have affected the mode of evolution of this HCV isolate,
the variation in the rates of synonymous (i.e. no amino
acid coding change) and nonsynonymous (i.e. changes in
the amino acid coding assignment) substitutions among
parental-like and the recombinant HCV strain were calculated for the genome region where the recombination
break-points were detected. Synonymous distances are
clearly significantly higher than nonsynonymous ones for
most of genome region analyzed (see Fig. 3). As a consequence, the ratio of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous
amino acid substitutions (Ka/Ks) is very low for most of
this genomic region (see Fig. 3).

Interestingly, the rates of synonymous substitutions in
AY651016–D10749 comparison are significantly lower in
the region spanned by the recombination break-points,
while significantly higher rates are obtained when
AF511949–D10749 comparison is performed (see Fig. 3).
The results of these studies show that even though recombination took place in the structural region of HCV
genome, is has not produced a drastic change in the mode
of evolution of the E1/E2 region, since the nonsynonymous substitution rate was maintained at very low rate
(see Fig. 3). Thus, at least on this basis, the E1/E2 genomic
region does not appear to have been perturbed by the
recombination event.

Discussion
In the present study, analysis of full-length sequences
from HCV strains of all types and sub-types provided the
opportunity to test the roll that recombination may play
in HCV genetic diversity.
The results of this study revealed that recombination may
not be extensive in HCV, since from 89 strains studied,
recombination was observed in only one case. This is in
agreement with the current methodology for HCV genotyping for the vast majority of the cases [10]. Nevertheless,
the true frequency of recombination may be underestimated because although there is comparative important
number of complete genomes sequences from common
genotypes, such as 1b, most studies of HCV variability in
high diversity areas are based on analysis of single subgenomic regions, making detection of potential recombination events unlikely [10].
On the other hand, this study reveals that recombination
can not be denied as an evolutionary mechanism for gen-

erating diversity in HCV (see Figs. 1 and 2). Moreover, an
infectious HCV chimera comprising the complete open
reading frame of sub-type 1b strain and the 5'- and 3' non
translated regions of a sub-type 1a strain has been constructed and is infectious in vivo [34]. A natural inter-genotype recombinant (2k/1b) has been identified in St.
Petersburg, Russia [29,30] and a natural intra-typic
recombinant (1a/1b) has been identified in Peru [31].
The recombination break-points for non-segmented positive-strand RNA viruses, such as polioviruses and other
picornaviruses [35-37] as well as members of the family
Flaviviridae, are often located in the part of the genome
encoding non structural proteins. More recently, recombination break-points have been found in genes encoding
structural proteins [38,39]. In the present study, we report
recombination events in structural genes (E1/E2 region)
between two different sub-types (1a/1c, see Figs. 1 and 2).
Recombination may serve two opposite purposes: exploration of a new combination of genomic region from dif-

ferent origins or rescuing of viable genomes from
debilitated parental genomes [40].
The recognition of recombination is important not only
for unraveling the phylogenetic history of genes, but also
for molecular phylogenetic inference. By ignoring the
presence of recombination, phylogenetic analysis may be
severely compromised [41,42]. For that reason, although
recombination may be not appeared to be extensive in
natural populations of HCV, this possibility should be
taken into account as a mechanism of genetic variation for
HCV.
The results of this study, as well as previous ones [29-31]
provide evidence that not only does recombination occurs
in HCV, but that it occurs in natural populations. In the
case of the recombinant described in this study, the distribution of non-synonymous substitutions showed very
low rates, revealing that the E1/E2 region of this isolate
might have not been perturbed by the recombination
events (see Fig. 3). This may also be related to the fact that
the differences in this region of the genome among subgenotypes 1A and 1C, at least in the case of the isolates

involved in these studies, are not particularly significant at
the amino acid level in the genomic region where the
recombination events have occurred.

Conclusion
Only one of 89 full-length strains studied resulted to be a
recombinant HCV strain, revealing that homologous
recombination does not play an extensive roll in HCV
evolution. A new intra-typic (1a/1c) recombinant strain
was found. The recombination break-points were found
in the structural (E1/E2) region of the HCV genome.
Whether new HCV variants may appear, as a result of
recombination events, remains to be established as well as
if their fitness permits them to be selected in an HCV population.

Methods
Sequences
Full-length genome sequences from 89 HCV isolates
where obtained by means of the use of the HCV LANL
database [43]. For names, genotypes and accession numbers see Table 1. Sequences were aligned using the CLUSTAL W program [44].

Recombination analysis
Putative recombinant sequences were identified with the
SimPlot program [32]. This program is based on a sliding
window method and constitutes a way of graphically displaying the coherence of the sequence relationship over
the entire length of a set of aligned homologous
sequences. The window width and the step size were set to
500 bp and 20 bp, respectively.

Bootscaning [33] was carried out employing software
from the SimPlot program [32], using putative recombinant sequence as a query. Mosaicism is suggested when
high levels of phylogenetic relatedness between the query
sequence and more than one reference sequence in different genomic regions is obtained.

Substitution rate analysis
The substitution rate along the open reading frame of the
HCV genome, from position 1 to 2490 (relative to the first
coding position of strain D10749), was measured using a
sliding window method according to the procedure
implemented by Alvarez-Valin [45]. Pairwise nucleotide
distances (synonymous and nonsynonymous) within
each window were estimated by the method of Comeron
[46] as implemented in the computer program k-estimator [47]. The window had a size of 150 codons and a
movement of 10.
