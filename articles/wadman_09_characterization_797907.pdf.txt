Abstract
Background: Aspergillus niger is an ascomycetous fungus that is known to reproduce through
asexual spores, only. Interestingly, recent genome analysis of A. niger has revealed the presence of
a full complement of functional genes related to sexual reproduction [1]. An example of such genes
are the dioxygenase genes which in Aspergillus nidulans, have been shown to be connected to
oxylipin production and regulation of both sexual and asexual sporulation [2-4]. Nevertheless, the
presence of sex related genes alone does not confirm sexual sporulation in A. niger.
Results: The current study shows experimentally that A. niger produces the oxylipins 8,11dihydroxy octadecadienoic acid (8,11-diHOD), 5,8-dihydroxy octadecadienoic acid (5,8-diHOD),
lactonized 5,8-diHOD, 8-hydroxy octadecadienoic acid (8-HOD), 10-hydroxy octadecadienoic acid
(10-HOD), small amounts of 8-hydroxy octadecamonoenoic acid (8-HOM), 9-hydroxy
octadecadienoic acid (9-HOD) and 13-hydroxy octadecadienoic acid (13-HOD). Importantly, this
study shows that the A. niger genome contains three putative dioxygenase genes, ppoA, ppoC and
ppoD. Expression analysis confirmed that all three genes are indeed expressed under the conditions
tested.
Conclusion: A. niger produces the same oxylipins and has similar dioxygenase genes as A. nidulans.
Their presence could point towards the existence of sexual reproduction in A. niger or a broader
role for the gene products in physiology, than just sexual development.

Background
The fungal kingdom comprises a large group of organisms
(estimated to consist of over 1.5 million species) with only
5% identified thus far. Fungal species can survive in virtually all biotopes on earth, as they have been identified in
water and soil, and on plants and animals. Part of their success comes from the ability to use different reproductive
strategies, which provide increased flexibility for diverse

environmental requirements. Fungal species can produce
sexual cells and/or asexual cells in distinct reproductive
structures. Some fungi are able to reproduce both sexually
and asexually depending on the circumstances, while others display one mode of reproduction, only. Sexual reproduction and recombination allows the repair of naturally
occurring mutations and results in new genotypes and phenotypes that allow for natural selection [5]. On the other

hand, asexual reproduction provides the ability to disperse
numerous genetically identical mitospores, without the
metabolic costs of sexual reproduction [5].
Aspergillus niger is an ascomycetous fungus that is considered to reproduce through asexual spores, only. Since A.
niger is used as a host for the production of homologous
and heterologous proteins and commercially important
compounds (such as citric acid), the potential presence of
a sexual cycle is highly significant for strain improvement.
Recent analysis of the A. niger genome has revealed the
presence of a full complement of genes related to sexual
reproduction [1]. It was therefore suggested that there
could be a latent sexual potential in A. niger. A similar
observation applies to Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus
oryzae, both only known to reproduce asexually, so far.
Comparison of the two genomes to the genome of
Aspergillus nidulans (please note that the holomorph is
correctly named Emericella nidulans, but is hereafter mentioned as A. nidulans), which has a known sexual cycle,
suggests that both A. fumigatus and A. oryzae may be capable of sexual reproduction [6]. It has yet to be determined
whether genes related to sexual reproduction in supposedly asexual fungi are functional.
Dioxygenase genes with homology to mammalian prostaglandin synthase (PGS) have been connected to the formation of oxylipins in A. nidulans. Dioxygenase genes and
oxylipins are linked to reproduction as they regulate the
balance between sexual and asexual sporulation [2-4]. The
goal of this study was to investigate whether or not oxylipins and dioxygenase genes related to sexual reproduction
are also present in the asexual fungus A. niger.

Results
RP-HPLC analysis
A crude extract of A. niger N402 biomass was incubated
with 18:2 and the reaction mixture was extracted with SPE
and analyzed on RP-HPLC. A typical HPLC chromatogram is shown in Fig. 1. Incubation with 18:2 resulted in
the appearance of three large peaks in the HPLC chromatogram and a smaller one. Similar results were obtained
for A. niger UU-A049.1, A. niger ΔppoA (UU-A050.3), A.
niger ΔppoD (UU-A051.26) and A. nidulans WG096 (data
not shown). For each strain, fatty acid reaction products
were fractionated on HPLC and after derivatization further investigated with GC/MS. Structures of oxygenated
fatty acids were deduced from the spectra of the TMS
ethers of methyl ester derivatives.
GC/MS analysis of dihydroxy fatty acids (RP-HPLC peak 1,
peak 2 and peak 2*)
Hydrogenated dihydroxy fatty acids as TMS ethers of
methyl ester derivatives from RP-HPLC peak 1 (Fig. 1)
were separated on GC and one dominant peak was
present in the chromatogram. The mass spectrum was

metabolites. RP-HPLC analysis and purification of the fatty acid
products were carried out on a Cosmosil 5C18-AR (5 μm;
250 × 4.6 mm i.d.; Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) reversedphase column using a gradient system (solvent A: methanol/
water/acetic acid (50:50:0.01, v/v/v); solvent B: methanol/
water/acetic acid (95:5:0.01, v/v/v)) with the following gradient
program: 45% solvent A for 1 min, followed by a linear
increase of solvent B up to 100% within 10 min and finally an
isocratic post-run at 100% solvent B for 10 min. The flow-rate
was 1 mL/min. Reference compounds of dihydroxy fatty acids
had a retention time of 9–11 min, whereas monohydroxy fatty
acid references eluted between 15–18 min.
similar that of the TMS ether of methyl 8,11-dihydroxy
octadecanoate [7]. The GC retention time and mass spectrum of the non-hydrogenated sample and the GC retention time and mass spectrum of TMS ether of methyl 8,11dihydroxy-9,12-octadecadienoate showed that the major
fatty acid product in RP-HPLC peak 1 (Fig. 1) was 8,11dihydroxy octadecadienoic acid (8,11-diHOD) [7].
Hydrogenated RP-HPLC peak 2 (Fig. 1) as TMS ether of
methyl ester derivative was separated on GC and one dominant peak was present in the chromatogram. The mass spectrum showed characteristic peaks stemming from cleavages
around the two oxygenated C atoms that indicated the presence of TMS ether of methyl 5,8-dihydroxy octadecanoate.
Comparison of the mass spectrum from hydrogenated and
non-hydrogenated samples showed that the TMS ether of
methyl 5,8-dihydroxy octadecanoate was derived from the
TMS ether of methyl 5,8-dihydroxy-9,12-octadecadienoate.
This was evidenced by the molecular ion at m/z 470 and by
the characteristic fragments resulting from cleavage around
the double bonds and oxygenated C atoms [8]. Thus RPHPLC peak 2 (Fig. 1) proved to be 5,8-diHOD.
RP-HPLC peak 2* was analyzed as a part of RP-HPLC peak
2, due to overlap. Hydrogenation of the TMS ether derivPage 2 of 9

ative showed peaks stemming from cleavage around an
oxygenated C-atom. The molecular ion at m/z 370 evidenced that this compound was TMS ether of lactonized
5,8-dihydroxyoctadecanoate. Comparing the hydrogenated sample with the non-hydrogenated sample showed
that TMS ether of lactonized 5,8-dihydroxy octadecanoate
probably originated from lactonized 5,8-diHOD.

very low when compared to the total ion-current of the
internal standard 17:0. Traces of 5,8-diHOD, 8,11diHOD, 8-HOD, 10-HOD, 13-HOD and 8-HOM were
detected, however, oxylipin levels were generally just
above background. Similar results were obtained for A.
niger UU-A049.1, A. niger ΔppoA (UU-A050.3), A. niger
ΔppoD (UU-A051.26) and A.nidulans WG096.

GC/MS analysis of monohydroxy fatty acids (RP-HPLC
peak 3)
In the GC chromatogram of the hydrogenated monohydroxy fatty acids of RP-HPLC peak 3 (Fig. 1) as TMS ethers
of methyl ester derivatives, one prominent peak was
present. The mass spectrum identified it as a mixture of
the TMS ethers of methyl 8-hydroxy octadecanoate,
methyl 10-hydroxy octadecanoate and a small amount of
methyl 9-hydroxy octadecanoate. Also, a small peak of
methyl 13-hydroxy octadecanoate was present in the GC
chromatogram. In the GC/MS analysis of the corresponding non-hydrogenated monohydroxy fatty acids as TMS
ethers of methyl ester derivatives, three peaks were visible
in the GC chromatogram. Reference compounds indicated that GC peak 1 (18.3 min) was TMS ether of methyl
8-hydroxy octadecadienoate because of the fragmentation
pattern and retention time of the non-hydrogenated sample [7]. The mass spectrum of TMS ether of methyl 10hydroxy octadecanoate, GC peak 2 (18.4 min), showed
that this compound originated from 10-hydroxy octadecadienoic acid (10-HOD). The mass spectrum of GC peak
4 (19.1 min) and the mass spectra of reference compounds showed that TMS ethers of methyl 13-hydroxy
octadecanoate and methyl 9-hydroxy decanoate were
derived from 13-hydroxy octadecadienoic acid (13-HOD)
and 9-hydroxy octadecadienoic acid (9-HOD), respectively. Thus, RP-HPLC peak 3 (Fig. 1) was composed of 8HOD (20), 10-HOD (18), 13-HOD (1) and 9-HOD (1).

Identification of three putative A. niger dioxygenase
genes, ppoA, ppoC and ppoD
A search of the A. niger N402 genomic database identified
three putative dioxygenase genes ppoA, ppoC and ppoD that
are located on chromosomes 6, 4 and 3, respectively, and
contained 6, 12, and 11 introns, respectively. The deduced
amino acid sequences of PpoA (1080 aa, 120 kD), PpoC
(1110 aa, 125 kD) and PpoD (1164 aa, 131 kD) represented proteins with strong homology to G. graminis LDS.
A. niger PpoA and PpoC were closely related to A. nidulans
PpoA and PpoC (Table 1). Comparing the sequence of A.
niger PpoD with those of PpoA, PpoB and PpoC from A.
nidulans showed that A. niger ppoD had strongest similarity to A. nidulans PpoA and PpoC and not to A. nidulans
PpoB (Table 1).

GC/MS analysis of monohydroxy fatty acids eluting after
RP-HPLC peak 3 (Fig. 1) as TMS ethers of methyl ester
derivatives showed that a small amount of 8-HOM was
also present (data not shown).
Characteristics of oxylipin formation
Incubation with [U-13C] 18:2 showed that all oxygenated
fatty acid products (RP-HPLC peak 1 to peak 3, Fig. 1) represented a mixture of converted 18:2 from endogenous
and exogenous sources. The conversion of 500 nmol exogenously supplied 18:2 was about 50% of the total conversion, as judged by the ratio of [U-13C] labeled fragments
to unlabeled fragments on GC/MS. In a reaction with 20:4
was shown that 20:4 it was not converted by an A. niger
N402 crude extract.
Endogenous oxylipins
Endogenous oxylipins of A. niger N402 biomass were
extracted and analyzed on GC/MS. Oxylipin levels were

In analogy with G. graminis LDS and A. nidulans Ppo's, A.
niger PpoA, PpoC and PpoD showed homology to animal
PGS (E-values > 7 × 10-21; > 3 × 10-24; > 3 × 10-18, respectively). A. niger PpoA, PpoC and PpoD also contained the
distal (202; 246; 265, respectively) and proximal (377;
424; 444, respectively) His, and Tyr (374; 420; 441,
respectively) residues, essential for catalytic activity of
PGS. Amino acid analysis of the predicted proximal His
domain revealed that PpoD differed from the other
Aspergillus Ppo's in having a Phe (443) instead of a Trp residue between the proximal His and Tyr residues and that
a Lys, conserved in the other Ppo's, was replaced by a Gln
(453) residue (Fig. 2)
Putative A. niger PpoA and PpoC contained the proline
knot motif that targets proteins to oil bodies in plants
[4,9]. In contrast A. niger PpoD did not contain the proline knot motif, the third Pro residue was replaced by an
Arg residue (Fig. 3).
Phenotypic characterization of A. niger transformants
To study the connection of the A. niger putative dioxygenase genes to oxylipin formation and reproduction, ppoA
and ppoD were inactivated by homologous recombination
of the domain encoding the catalytic site with the argB
cassette. A. niger ΔppoA and ΔppoD mutants had no alterations in radial growth. Also their response to osmotic, oxidative and temperature stress, and combinations thereof,
did not differ from the reaction of the wild type. No effect
on sporulation was observed for the ppoA and ppoD disruption strains or the ppoA multicopy strain. However, a
34% reduction in conidiospores was observed in the ppoC

added, all strains showed reduced conidiospore counts
compared to the wild type.
A. niger microarray analysis
Analysis of expression levels of A. niger putative dioxygenases ppoA, ppoC and ppoD showed that the three genes
were expressed from the center to the periphery of the A.
niger colonies grown on maltose, however, the level of
expression differed (Fig. 4). The genes ppoA and ppoD were
expressed mainly in the periphery, while levels of ppoC
expression were equally distributed throughout the colony and low in comparison to the expression of ppoA and
ppoD. Similar results were obtained during growth on Dxylose (data not shown). Since the A. niger strains were
grown in sandwiched cultures, the formation of conidia
was suppressed. Expression profiles of dioxygenase genes
may be different in sporulating colonies.

Discussion
The goal of this study was to investigate whether or not
oxylipins and dioxygenase genes, that are related to both
asexual and sexual reproduction, are present in the asexual fungus A. niger.
Using RP-HPLC and GC/MS, this study demonstrated that
A. niger converted 18:2 mainly into 8,11-diHOD, 5,8diHOD, lactonized 5,8-diHOD, 8-HOD and 10-HOD.
The reaction with [U-13C] 18:2 showed that these compounds were produced from a mixture of exogenously
added and endogenously present 18:2.
The presence of 5,8-diHOD, lactonized 5,8-diHOD, 8HOD and 10-HOD, but not the presence of 8,11-diHOD
were reported in A. nidulans [8,10-13] and related to sexual reproduction [2-4]. Interestingly, in the present study
8,11-diHOD was one of the oxylipins formed by A. nidu-

lans. During the preparation of this manuscript, a study
was published showing that the asexual fungus A. fumigatus also produced 5,8-diHOD, 8,11-diHOD 8-HOD and
10-HOD [13]. This indicates that A. niger, A. nidulans and
A. fumigatus all produce the same oxylipins.
Analysis of the A. niger genome revealed that this fungus
contains three putative dioxygenase genes, ppoA, ppoC and
ppoD. A ppoB homologue was not present. A. niger transformants lacking the ppoA or ppoD gene were not altered
in their ability to produce oxylipins and sporulation. A
reduction in conidiospore formation was observed in the
ppoC multicopy strain. In contrast, in A. nidulans ppoA,
ppoB or ppoC were found to be connected to oxylipin pro-

duction and to modification of sexual and asexual sporulation. Deletion of ppoA, ppoB or ppoC was demonstrated
to reduce the level of 8-HOD, 8-HOM and 8-HOM,
respectively [2-4]. But a later study showed that deletion
of ppoA led to a reduction of 8-HOD and 5,8-diHOD formation and that elimination of ppoC reduced 10-HOD
formation [13]. The removal of ppoB did not alter oxylipin
production [13]. In addition, deletion of ppoA or ppoB
from the A. nidulans genome increased the ratio of asexual
to sexual spores [3,4]. Elimination of ppoC on the other
hand, significantly reduced the ratio of asexual to sexual
spores [2]. Absence of a phenotype for the disruption
strains of A. niger for ppoA and ppoD, could suggest that
they are non-essential or that they in fact have the same
function. Future studies into these genes should include
construction of double-disruptants. The inability to isolate ppoC disruptants might suggest that this is an essential
gene in A. niger even though this is not the case in A. nidulans [2] and could possibly indicate significant differences in the role of these genes in different fungi. When
linoleic acid was added, all strains showed reduced asexual sporulation compared to the wild type, suggesting that
addition of linoleic acid could not be compensated for
when the production of the different Ppo's is altered in A.
niger.
A. niger PpoD had deviating amino acid residues in the
vicinity of the proximal His domain and did not contain
the proline knot motif (Fig. 3). This motif targets plant
proteins to oil bodies and it has been demonstrated that
fungi target such proteins to oil bodies as well [14]. In
addition, the proline knot is predicted to facilitate the formation of an antiparallel α-helix or β-strand [9]. Therefore, A. niger PpoD likely differs from the other Ppo's in its
three dimensional structure It could be argued that the
presence of ppoD instead of ppoB in A. niger is related to
the reproductive differences between A. niger and A. nidulans. However, this seems unlikely since the genomes of
Aspergillus clavatus, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus terreus,
all not known to reproduce sexually, do contain ppoB
homologues. Additionally, Histoplasma capsulatum, a fun-

gus belonging to the same class as the Aspergilli, contains
ppoD and also does not contain ppoB, but is able to produce sexual spores [3]. Expression analysis of A. niger
ppoA, ppoC and ppoD shows that these genes are expressed
and their expression levels depend on the fungus' developmental stage (Fig. 4). It should be noted that A. niger is
heterothallic and requires mating between two isolates
with different mating types. Despite the fact that A. niger
appears to contain all the genes required for a sexual cycle,
until now, no sexual cycle has been observed for A. niger
on any of a broad range of growth conditions (Paul Dyer,
personal communication). In contrast, A. nidulans is a
homothallic species in which both mating types are
present in a single strain and can therefore cross with
itself. This difference might hint towards different strategies for regulation of sexual and asexual development.
Studies of these genes in other homothallic and heterothallic Aspergilli, could demonstrate whether this is a general difference between homothallic and heterothallic
species. This could include the presence or absence of
expression of specific dioxygenase genes.
Strictly asexual species are considered an evolutionary
endpoint, and truly asexual species are thought to be
extremely rare [5]. Sequencing of fungal genomes and
comparative analysis of sexual and asexual species show
that fungi that have long been considered asexual organisms, may have a latent potential for sexual reproduction
[1,6]. Nevertheless, the presence of sex related genes
alone, does not confirm sexual reproduction.

Conclusion
This study shows that A. niger produces the same oxylipins
and has similar dioxygenase genes as A. nidulans. Even
though, the functionality of these genes remains as yet to
be proven, their presence could point towards the existence of sexual reproduction in A. niger or a broader role
for the gene products in physiology, than just sexual
development.

Methods
Materials
All chemicals used were commercially obtained and of
analytical grade. Linoleic acid (9Z,12Z-octadecadienoic
acid, 18:2, 99% pure), arachidonic acid, 5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z-

eicosatetraenoic acid, 20:4, 99% pure) and margaric acid
(heptadecanoic acid, 17:0, 99% pure) were obtained from
Sigma (St. Louis, MO). [U-13C] 18:2 (99% pure) was
obtained from Isotec (Matheson Trigas, Irving, TX). Solutions of 30 mM fatty acid were stored in methanol under
N2 at -20°C until use.
Strains, media and culture conditions
Aspergillus strains used are listed in Table 2. Cultures were
grown in minimal medium containing trace elements and
1% glucose as carbon source, unless otherwise indicated
in the text [15]. Appropriate supplements (8 μM nicotinamide, 1.5 mM leucine, 5 mM uridine) were added to the
media to complement auxotrophic mutations. Aspergillus
cultures were inoculated with 106 spores/ml and grown at
30°C on a rotary shaker (Inova 2300; New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) at 250 rpm. For growth on solid media
1.5% of agar was added. Strains were grown in 25 ml of
liquid medium in Petri dishes under stationary conditions
at 30°C. Alternatively, strains were grown in 50 ml of liquid medium at 30°C in a rotary shaker at 250 rpm. Mycelial mats were collected after 72 h, dried between filter
paper sheets and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Oxylipin characterization and analysis of enzymatic
capacity
For analysis of endogenously present oxylipins, samples
were lyophilized, weighed and homogenized mechanically using a microdismembrator (B. Braun GmbH, Melsungen, Germany). Free fatty acids and their derivatives
were extracted with 80% methanol 1:10 (w/v), centrifuged at 4°C, 2500 × g for 20 min and recovered by solid
phase extraction (SPE, Oasis HLB 200 mg; Waters, Milford, MA). 17:0 was used as an internal standard.

The enzymatic capacity to oxygenate fatty acids of Aspergillus strains was examined as follows. Samples were homogenized, extracted with phosphate buffer (50 mM sodium
phosphate pH 6.5, 5:1 w/v) and centrifuged at 4°C, 2500
× g for 20 min. The supernatant (crude extract) was filtered through cheesecloth and used immediately. Typically, 4 mL phosphate buffer was mixed with 1 mL crude
extract, rigorously stirred and incubated with 120 μM substrate for 30–45 min at room temperature under a contin-

uous flow of O2. Fatty acids and reaction products were
recovered directly by SPE.
RP-HPLC and GC/MS analysis
SPE eluates were concentrated under N2, and analyzed by
RP-HPLC. Analysis by GC/MS of the fatty acid products as
TMS ethers of methyl ester derivatives was performed as
described previously [16]. The fatty acid methylation reagent was diazomethane. For GC/MS analysis, samples
were analyzed before and after hydrogenation. Oxylipins
were identified by mass spectrum on the basis of their
fragmentation patterns.
Nucleic acid manipulations
The amino acid sequence of Gaeumannomyces graminis
linoleate diol synthase (LDS) [17] was used to perform a
BLASTp search of the A. niger N402 [18] genomic database (DSM food specialties, Delft, The Netherlands).
Three putative dioxygenase genes (ppoA; GeneID:
4990997, ppoC; GeneID: 4985482 and ppoD; GeneID:
4979282) were identified that predicted proteins with
high similarity to LDS. These genes were aligned to the ppo
genes from A. nidulans and to the LDS from G. graminis
and a phylogenetic tree was created using the ClustalW
program http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw. Pairwise scores
between amino acids were represented as the number of
identities and positives.

Primers to amplify fragments for complete gene (constructs containing promoter, gene and terminator) and
disruption constructs were based upon the A. niger N402
genome sequence. These primers introduced restriction
sites at either site of the amplified fragment during a PCR
reaction (Table 3). A. niger genomic DNA was isolated
using previously described techniques and used as the
PCR template [19]. PCRs were carried out with AccuTaq
LA™ DNA polymerase according to the manufacturer's
protocol (Sigma) and the annealing temperature varied
between 52°C and 60°C. Amplified PCR products were
cloned into the pGEMTeasy vector (Promega, Madison,
WI) and used to transform competent Escherichia coli
DH5α. Positive clones containing the fragments for complete gene or disruption constructs were analyzed by
restriction mapping and sequence comparisons to the
NCBI genetic database using the tBLASTn algorithm http:/
/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov.
Creation of disruption and complete gene constructs
Primers for fragments for disruption constructs were
designed at the 5' and 3' flanking regions of predicted catalytic domains of PpoA, PpoC and PpoD. These catalytic
domains were identified by ClustalW alignment of predicted PpoA, PpoC and PpoD to the LDS from G. graminis
of which the catalytic domain has been identified [17].

1010 for PpoD were deleted. These contained for both
PpoA and PpoD the distal (202; 265, respectively) and
proximal (377; 444, respectively) His, and Tyr (374; 441,
respectively) residues, essential for catalytic activity of
PGS. Primers for complete genes were designed approximately 80 bp outside of the coding region.
Disruption constructs for ppoA, ppoC and ppoD, including
the argB marker gene, were created as follows [20]. First,
the 5' and 3' flanking regions were amplified by PCR
introducing the indicated restriction sites (Table 3). The
amplified products were digested from pGEMTeasy, separated on 0.8% agarose gel and isolated. The flanks were
ligated into the pUC19 vector (Fermentas, Ontario, Canada) containing the argB cassette (pRV542) previously
digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes resulting in the disruption constructs for ppoA, ppoC and ppoD.
Disruption constructs were linearized by digestion with
KpnI/HindIII and used for A. niger transformations.
A. niger transformations
Protoplasts were prepared from A. niger UU-A049.1 as
described and transformed using polyethylene glycol
[21]. Transformation of A. niger UU-A049.1 with ppoA
and ppoD disruption constructs created transformants to
ArginineB prototrophy with the catalytic domain of the
corresponding gene product deleted. Three independent
Aspergillus niger transformations did not result in the isolation of a ppoC disruptant and we were therefore not able
to analyze this gene disruption. Transformants were purified by repeated streaking of conidia. Gene replacement
and ectopic integration of the argB marker gene were
checked by PCR and Southern analysis using internal fragments as probes.
Probe construction and Southern analysis
Constructs of complete genes of ppoA and ppoD were
digested with EcoRV and SphI, respectively, yielding internal probes for the encoding region of the catalytic
domain. Fragments were separated on an 0.8% agarose
gel, isolated and randomly labeled with [α-32P]dCTP. This
resulted in 1082 and 1146 bp fragments for ppoA and a
1241 bp fragment for ppoD. Chromosomal DNA of A.
niger transformants was digested with the appropriate
restriction enzymes. Hybridization with radioactive
probes was done as described, except that washing of the
filters was done at 65°C [22]. Positive transformants, lacking the signals from the internal probes on the Southernblot, were selected and used for further characterization.
Phenotypic characterization of A. niger transformants
Characterization of A. niger transformants was performed
on solid minimal medium containing 1% glucose and
supplemented with or without 1 M NaCl and/or 0.01%
H2O2 at 30°C and 42°C. Spots of 10000, 1000, 100 and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/59

10 conidia were pipetted on each plate and incubated.
Strains A. niger 49.1 and A. niger N402 were used as wild
type. Spore production studies were carried out on plates
containing 25 mL solid minimal medium and 1% glucose
[3]. For each plate a 5 mL top layer of cool melted 0.6%
agar minimal medium and 1% glucose containing 107
conidia of the appropriate strain was added. In some cases
1.5% methanol or 1.5% methanol and 10 μg/mL linoleic
acid were added to both agar layers. Cultures were incubated at 30°C. Cores of 16 mm diameter were removed
from each plates and homogenized for 1 min in 3 mL sterile water supplemented with 0.01% Tween-80 to facilitate
release of the hydrophobic conidia. Spores were counted
by using a haemacytometer.
A. niger microarray analysis
A. niger N402 was grown at 30°C as sandwiched cultures
[23] in minimal medium [15] with 25 mM maltose or 25
mM D-xylose as carbon source. Zonal mycelial samples
from 3 sandwich cultures were combined and used for
RNA analysis. Mycelium was ground using a microdismembrator and RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the instructions
of the manufacturer. RNA was purified using Nucleospin
RNA clean up (Macherey-Nagel GmbH, Düren, Germany). Concentration of RNA was measured at λ260.
Quality of the RNA was analyzed on an Agilent 2100 BioAnalyzer using the RNA6000 labchip kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Biotin-labeled antisense cRNA was
generated by labeling 20 or 2 μg of total RNA with the BioArray High Yield RNA transcription labeling kit (ENZO)
or the Affymetrix Eukaryotic One-Cycle Target Labeling
and Control Reagent package, respectively. The quality of
the cRNA was checked using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. The labeled cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix A.
niger Genechips. Absolute values of expression were calculated from the scanned array using the Affymetrix GCOS
software after an automated process of washing and staining. Microarray Suite Affymetrix v5.1 (Affymatrix Inc.,
Santa Clara, CA), Spotfire DecisionSite (Spotfire Inc,
Somerville, MA), GeneData Expressionist Analyst V Pro
2.0.18 (GeneData, Basel, Switzerland) and the R statistical
environment http://www.r-cran.org were used for data
analyses.
