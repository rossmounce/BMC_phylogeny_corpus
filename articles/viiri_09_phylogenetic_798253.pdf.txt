Abstract
Background: Deacetylation of histones plays a fundamental role in gene silencing, and this is
mediated by a corepressor complex containing Sin3 as an essential scaffold protein. In this report
we examine the evolution of two proteins in this complex, the Sin3-associated proteins SAP30L
and SAP30, by using an archive of protein sequences from 62 species.
Results: Our analysis indicates that in tetrapods SAP30L is more similar than SAP30 to the
ancestral protein, and the two copies in this group originated by gene duplication which occurred
after the divergence of Actinopterygii and Sarcopterygii about 450 million years ago (Mya). The
phylogenetic analysis and biochemical experiments suggest that SAP30 has diverged functionally
from the ancestral SAP30L by accumulating mutations that have caused attenuation of one of the
original functions, association with the nuclear matrix. This function is mediated by a nuclear matrix
association sequence, which consists of a conserved motif in the C-terminus and the adjacent
nucleolar localization signal (NoLS).
Conclusion: These results add further insight into the evolution and function of proteins of the
SAP30 family, which share many characteristic with nuclear scaffolding proteins that are intimately
involved in regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, SAP30L seems essential to eukaryotic
biology, as it is found in animals, plants, fungi, as well as some taxa of unicellular eukaryotes.

Background
The Sin3 multiprotein complex plays a central role in gene
silencing by deacetylating histones, and deletion of the
mouse SIN3A gene results in lethality at a postimplantation stage of development [1]. SAP30 was initially found
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human cells as a protein
which co-immunopurified with the Sin3 corepressor
complex [2-4]. In cultured cells, SAP30 is not necessary for
repression activity by the Sin3 complex, but it participates

in N-CoR-mediated repression by specific transcription
factors [4]. Thus, it functions as a bridging and stabilizing
molecule between the Sin3 complex and corepressors
such as N-CoR [4] and CIR [5], and DNA-binding transcription factors such as YY1 [6]. Mammals have one paralog of SAP30, named "SAP30-like" (SAP30L), which
shares 70% sequence identity with SAP30 [7]. SAP30L
also binds to the Sin3A complex and represses transcription when tethered to different promoters [8]. In S. cerevi-

siae, SAP30 has been shown to be involved in regulation
of transcription of the HMR, telomeric, and rDNA loci
[9,10], and SAP30-deficient yeast strains have defects in
ribosomal rRNA processing [11]. Consistent with a nucleolar function, we have previously identified nucleolar
localization signals (NoLSs) in human SAP30 and
SAP30L, and showed that they can direct Sin3A to the
nucleolus [8].
Recently, we identified by mass spectrometric studies a
C2CH-type zinc-binding module in the N-termini of
SAP30 and SAP30L [12]. An independent NMR-study also
confirmed the results that SAP30 proteins contain C2CHtype large zinc fingers [13]. This structure is essential for
the stability and DNA-binding activity of both proteins.
Close to the zinc-binding module resides a polybasic
region originally identified as a nuclear localization signal
(NLS) in SAP30L [7]. We showed that this region, together
with the preceding hydrophobic region, mediates specific
interactions of SAP30/SAP30L with the monophosphoinositides (PIPs) PdtIns3P, PtdIns4P and PtdIns5P.
Intriguingly, DNA- and PIP-binding occur in the same
region and compete with each other. Increasing the concentration of monophosphosphoinositides leads to the
release of DNA from SAP30/SAP30L, and reduced transcriptional repression [12]. Furthermore, we showed that
SAP30 and SAP30L interact with core histones and nucleosomes and that this interaction is partly mediated by the
central acidic region [12].
Nucleotide sequences belonging to the SAP30 family have
been found in many eukaryotic species, but most of these
putative homologs remain unrecognized and uncharacterized in databases, including those of the NCBI. Here we
present a phylogenetic analysis of proteins of the SAP30
family. Our analyses indicate that SAP30L is the ancestral
protein of this family and it is found in animals, plants,
fungi and some protists. A single duplication event of an
ancient SAP30L-bearing chromosome segment gave rise
to the SAP30 gene. The most conserved region in SAP30
proteins is in the C-terminus, and we show by biochemical experiments that this region is responsible for association with the nuclear matrix. Phylogenetic analysis reveals
that SAP30 has accumulated mutations in its C-terminus,
and this has reduced its association with the nuclear
matrix. This study suggests that proteins of the SAP30
family play a role in Sin3-mediated repression through
multiple interactions with the nuclear matrix, nuclear proteins and DNA.

1). Careful analyses reveal that similar genes flank the
SAP30 and SAP30L genes in their respective chromosomes and, in fact, these two chromosomes are known to
share duplicated segments [14]. The GALNT 10 and
GALNT7 genes are located upstream of the SAP30L and
SAP30 genes, respectively. On the downstream side, the
SAP30L gene is followed by HAND1, and the SAP30 gene
by HAND2. It is noteworthy that the degree of sequence
identity between the proteins encoded by these flanking
genes is similar to that between SAP30 and SAP30L, when
aligned by Clustal V. Since the occurrence of a chromosomal duplication event seemed likely, we analyzed other
organisms for the presence of this GALNT-SAP-HAND
block in order to estimate the time of the duplication
event. The mouse and chicken genomes were found to
have a similar, conserved GALNT-SAP-HAND organization. The zebrafish has a predicted GALNT gene upstream
of the SAP30L gene, and this most likely represents the
ancestral chromosome segment because the zebrafish has
only one member of the SAP30 family in its genome (see
below). In the human genome, the size of the duplicated
segment, vectoring the SAP30 family genes between chromosomes 4 and 5, is approximately 400 kb. Comparative
analysis of human chromosome 5 [15] has pinpointed
this particular 400 kb region as the interchromosomally
duplicated segment. Furthermore, our analysis confirms
that this region in chromosome 5 is in fact the donor template for the duplication which gave rise to the SAP30
family ~450 Mya, after the Actinopterygii-Sarcopterygii
separation [16]. Human chromosome 5 and linkage
group 21 (LG21) in the zebrafish have been shown to
share most of the conserved syntenies, indicating that
these are orthologous chromosomes [17]. Although the
genes in these chromosomes were syntenic in the last
common ancestor of the zebrafish and human, massive
intrachromosomal rearrangements have apparently
occurred in the fish and/or mammalian lineages since
their divergence. Such rearrangements are known to occur
in the SAP30L-harboring human chromosome 5q region
[18], which is frequently deleted in myeloid malignancies
such as the 5q- syndrome. The synteny between the
zebrafish LG21 and human chromosome 5 has been disrupted by intrachromosomal translocations and inversions of chromosome segments. The fact that the GALNTSAP microsynteny has been preserved between fish and
human chromosomes, and between human chromosomes 4 and 5, indicates that these genes may have some
kind of cooperative function. Perhaps they are under common regulation or even give rise to chimeric transcripts,
which are in fact predicted in the USCS database [19].

62 members of the SAP30 family were identified by PsiBlast searches with the human SAP30L sequence on a
non-redundant protein sequence database. SAP30 family
sequences were found in a variety of species from Animalia, Plantae and Fungi, as well as in several green algae but
not in any chloroplastless protist. In addition, one SAP30
family member in the ambiguous Mycetozoan group was
found. In the yeasts, our searches identified SAP30 family
members in only two subphyla within the phylum Ascomycota: Saccharomycotina and Pezizomycotina. The
third subphylum, Taphrinomycotina seems to have lost
SAP30 family proteins during evolution, as we could not
find any recognizable sequences from this subphylum,
when Schizosaccharomyces pombe, as a representative species whose whole genome has been sequenced, was analyzed (from the NCBI database or the S. pombe gene
database from Sanger Institute). The composition of the
Sin3 corepressor complex in S. pombe seems to be distinct
from that in other eukaryotes as its genome is reported to
also lack SAP18 and SDS3 [20], other core members of the
complex. According to a comprehensive analysis of yeast
evolution [21], Taphrinomycotina is the earliest diverging
clade within the phylum Ascomycota, and this divergence
is estimated to have occurred ~1140 ± 80 Mya [22]. However, SAP30L was also found in plants and the green algae
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (see alignment in additional
file 1). Molecular clock analyses indicate that plants separated from the lineage leading to the mycetozoans and
fungi about 1580 ± 90 Mya [22] and thus, this is also the
estimated age of the SAP30 family.
Multiple Clustal W alignment of sequences of the SAP30
family identified a highly conserved region in the C-terminus (Figure 2), which consists mainly of aliphatic (I, L, V),
aromatic (F, Y, W, H) and charged (H, K, R, D, E) residues.
Moreover, when the alignment is examined according to
the physiochemical properties of the amino acids, this
region shows 100% conservation in the nine C-terminal
residues. The consensus sequence of this conserved C-terminal motif is [hydrophobic]-x(2)-[hydrophobic][hydrophobic]-x(4)-[hydrophobic] -x-[amphoteric]-x(2)[hydrophobic]-[aliphatic]-x(2)-[hydrophobic]-[hydrophobic].

The Clustal W alignment of SAP30/SAP30L sequences
shown in Figure 2 also revealed that the nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) [8], which consists of basic amino
acids is quite conserved among the species studied.
Although there is no striking co-aligning NoLS in yeast
and plants sequences, they contain polybasic region preceding C-terminal motif. As a conclusion, the C-terminal
domain, NoLS motif and the Sin3-interacting domain
(SID) represent the most ancient region in proteins of the
SAP30 family, and this domain evidently appeared early
in the evolution of this family. Despite the apparent lack

of a co-aligning NoLS in yeasts, the reported functions of
SAP30 in rDNA transcription [9,10] and ribosome biogenesis [11] suggest that SAP30 is targeted to the nucleolus, and fulfills these functions in yeasts as well.
Conserved domain structure in proteins of the SAP30
family within animals
The alignment of animal SAP30 and SAP30L sequences
revealed several conserved regions in these proteins (Figure 2 and Additional file 2). One of these is the N-terminal zinc-dependent module, in which all four zinccoordinating residues (CCCH) [12] are strictly conserved.
The distances between these zinc-coordinating residues
are highly conserved as C-×(8)-C-×(35)-C-×(2)-H, suggesting that they are critical for proper folding of the zincbinding module. The amino acids at the DNA-binding
interface in the loop region are also well conserved, and
show mainly conservative substitutions consisting of
polar and basic residues. The DNA/PIP-binding domain
[12], which constitutes the NLS motif [7] and comprises
the polybasic region adjacent to the zinc-binding module,
is also well conserved, as are the NoLS motif, SID domain
and the acidic central region that contributes to histone
and nucleosome binding [7,8,12]. The high degree of conservation indicates that all these modules are probably
important for the function of the SAP30 family proteins.
Phylogenetic analysis and timing of the SAP30L gene
duplication
Phylogenetic trees were generated from the Clustal W
alignment (Figure 2) of the SAP30 protein sequences presented in Table 1 using the distance, parsimony and likelihood methods. Statistical confidence was measured by
Jackknife analysis with 1000 "delete-half jackknife" data
sets except in the likelihood method, in which case only
100 data sets were measured due to constraints imposed
by computation time. All three methods gave trees with
congruent topologies, the main discrepancies being the
varying positions of the single representatives from the

Echinodermata, Cnidaria and Mycetozoa. A reliable positioning of these sequences would probably require more
data from these taxa, and prefererably from the intermediate taxa as well, but the content of the current databases
does not allow this. The extensive sequence divergence
observed within the yeasts (Additional file 3) may also
explain the non-monophyly of the Ascomycota in the
both the parsimony and the likelihood trees. In the distance tree (Figure 3), as well as in the parsimony and likelihood trees (Additional files 4 and 5), SAP30 proteins
clearly fall into one group (with Jackknife percentage values of 93.4%, 99.8% and 88% for the distance, parsimony
and likelihood methods, respectively). This strongly supports a single origin for the SAP30 protein family. The
presence of SAP30L and the absence of SAP30 in the fish
(Danio rerio and Tetraodon nigroviridis) genomes suggests
that the SAP30 gene originated from the ancestral SAP30L
gene by duplication of a chromosome segment after the
divergence of fishes (Actinopterygii, ray-finned fishes) but
before the divergence of amphibians which belong to the
Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fishes). In fact, according to an
analysis by Friedman et al. 77.7% of the interchromosomal duplication events that can be seen in the human
genome have occurred prior to the amniote-amphibian
separation [14]. Careful inspection of the animal SAP30/
SAP30L sequences (Additional file 2) reveals that many
amino acid substitutions are characteristic for either
SAP30 or SAP30L (apomorphic), and therefore carry phylogenetic information about the duplication of the
SAP30L gene.
Functional divergence of the paralogous SAP30 and
SAP30L genes
It is noteworthy that the tetrapodan SAP30 orthologs
from frogs to humans (Sarcopterygii) are much more dispersed in the distance tree than are the SAP30L orthologs
in the corresponding species (Figure 4). This is also evident in the alignment of animal SAP30/SAP30L
sequences (Additional file 2). The sarcopterygian SAP30

proteins contain more amino acid substitutions, and
many more deletions and insertions, than the SAP30L
proteins. In fact, the divergence and amino acid identity
values for SAP30 protein sequences between Homo sapiens
and Xenopus tropicalis are 27.2% and 74.2%, respectively,
whereas the corresponding values for SAP30L are 9.5%
and 89%. It seems that since their divergence by segmental duplication from a common ancestor, the evolutionary
rate in SAP30 proteins has been much higher than in
SAP30L proteins. This is what is thought to occur more
generally in duplicated genes, where the new copy will
evolve unencumbered by the selective constraints
imposed on its progenitor [23]. Furthermore, the evolutionary rate of amino acid substitution may increase and
functional divergence may take place at the early stage of
evolution after separation [24]. This is followed by the late

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/149

stage, in which purifying selection plays a major role in
maintaining related, but distinct functions. This has
allowed SAP30 to gain more length, mainly by microsatellite expansion near its N-terminus. It is not known if this
has produced "gene innovation" (i.e. addition of a new
functional domain) to SAP30, because the function of this
N-terminal extension is currently unknown.
Since the cluster-specific residues between SAP30 and
SAP30L in the sarcopterygian clusters were prominent in
the alignment, we tested whether these residues are functionally relevant. Functional significance is highly correlated with evolutionary conservation [25]. If a particular
amino acid site is variable in both clusters, it is unlikely to
have any major functional role in either paralog. Conversely, conservation of an amino acid in one cluster and

lack of conservation in a sister cluster is assumed to contribute to functional differences between the paralogs.
This site-specific shift in the evolutionary rate between
clusters is known as type-I functional divergence [26]. In
type-II functional divergence, a particular site is conserved
in both clusters but the physicochemical property of the
amino acid is different between the clusters [27]. To test if
the cluster-specific residues in SAP30 and SAP30L are
indicative of type-I divergence, we estimated the coefficient of functional divergence (θ), which measures the difference in the evolutionary rate at amino acid sites
between gene clusters. Rejection of the null hypothesis (θ
= 0) is strong evidence for altered functional constraints
after gene duplication (or speciation) [28]. We found significant evidence for type-I divergence in the comparison
between sarcopterygian SAP30 and SAP30L clusters (θI =
0.46 ± 0.18, p < 0.01 Figure 5a), but not in the control
comparison between sarcopterygian and arthropodan
SAP30L clusters (θI = 0.25 ± 0.19, p > 0.19), which reflects
the situation before the gene duplication. Similarly, significant type-II functional divergence was detected only
between SAP30 and SAP30L clusters (θII = 0.12 ± 0.05, p <
0.05), whereas it was undetectable before the gene duplication (θII = 0.07 ± 0.08, p > 0.37). To put these findings
into perspective, the human SAP30 and SAP30L share
70% amino acid identity, whereas the human SAP30L and
the Drosophila melanogaster SAP30L share only 50% identity. This latter comparison clearly shows that it is mostly
the neutral amino acid sites with no functional role that
are variable, whereas after the gene duplication (i.e. the
emergence of SAP30), functional divergence has taken
place.
To conclude, after the sarcopterygian radiation around
450 Mya, the duplicated SAP30 has diverged functionally
from the ancestral SAP30L. In contrast, evolutionary constraints have kept SAP30L functionally unchanged for
~1000 My, since the separation of arthropods and sarcopterygians [29]. In spite of considerable divergence in
sequence, only functionally insignificant changes constitute the sequence differences in SAP30L between these
two clades. This presumably reflects the fact that purifying
selection has acted to conserve SAP30L.
The site-specific profile for the amino acid residues
deemed responsible for type-I and type-II functional
divergence (Figure 5b) show that most of the functional
divergence is found in the C-terminal region and between
the experimentally identified domains. However, previous experiments have shown that: i) the repression capacity of SAP30 is only half of that of SAP30L, ii) SAP30L is
able to self-oligomerize in vivo whereas SAP30 is not, and
iii) SAP30L is more concentrated in the nucleolus than
SAP30 in transfection experiments [8]. These biochemical
data, together with the molecular evolutionary analysis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/149

described here, suggest that the original functions are executed by SAP30L, but in SAP30 these functions are abandoned or suppressed.
The functional divergence between SAP30 and SAP30L is
due to differences in their association with the nuclear
matrix
Although the C-terminal region is the most conserved part
in proteins of the SAP30 family, considerable type-I and
type-II functional divergence has occurred in this region
after the separation of the SAP30L and SAP30 genes (Figure 5b). Our previous subcellular fractionation experiments showed that nuclear retention of SAP30L is
achieved by interaction with DNA through the N-terminal
domain [12]. We also demonstrated that the C-terminus
has a role in nuclear retention, because C-terminally truncated mutants of SAP30L leaked to the cytoplasm in transfection studies [8,12]. We therefore asked whether the Cterminal region constitutes a nuclear matrix association
sequence. When myc-tagged constructs of wild type (wt)
SAP30 and SAP30L were transfected into HeLa cells and
the nuclear matrix was isolated, we noticed that staining
of the perinucleolar ring was resistant to Triton-X and
DNAse I treatments, indicating that the proteins remained
attached to the nuclear matrix in the perinucleolar ring
region (Figure 6a). SAP30L1-120 was completely soluble,
while the 1–140 and 1–160 versions showed some attachment to the nuclear matrix (Figure 6a). Intriguingly,
SAP30L seemed to be bound more tightly than SAP30,
suggesting that SAP30 has accumulated mutations that
hinder its association with the nuclear matrix. In order to
gain more quantitative data, we performed subcellular
fractionation experiments and found that SAP30 was considerably more soluble than SAP30L, which accumulated
in the nuclear matrix/chromatin fractions. The 1–120
mutant of SAP30L showed markedly reduced accumulation in the nuclear matrix/chromatin fraction, and the 1–
140 and 1–160 mutants were also more soluble than wt
SAP30L (Figure 6b), indicating that an intact C-terminus
is necessary for the association with the nuclear matrix
(see Figure 6e for a schematic representation of the
domains identified in SAP30L). Since the nuclear matrix
participates in gene transcription [30] and repression
[31], the impaired association of the 1–140 version of
SAP30L with the nuclear matrix could explain its previously observed, reduced repression activity [8].

We recently showed that the N-terminal zinc-dependent
module and the following hydrophobic region together
with polybasic region/NLS are needed for DNA binding in
vitro and chromatin association in vivo [12]. As shown in
Figure 6c (left panel), solubilization of chromatin with
micrococcal nuclease does not detach wt SAP30 or wt
SAP30L from the nuclear matrix. Their attachment is
dependent on an intact C-terminus, which thus consti-

tutes a nuclear matrix association sequence (Figure 6c,
right panel). The association of SAP30 with the nuclear
matrix seems to be weaker than that of SAP30L. Alternatively, SAP30 may possess a less effective NLS or NoLS
and/or a more effective nuclear export signal (NES). Interestingly, Sin3A has also been reported to associate with
the nuclear matrix [32], and we used it as a control nuclear
matrix protein. Taken together, these findings show that
proteins of the SAP30 family are able to interact with corepressors (e.g. Sin3, N-CoR), associate with the nuclear
matrix, and bind DNA, and therefore possess many characteristics typical of nuclear scaffolding proteins [33]. A
well studied example of nuclear scaffolding proteins is
provided by members of the RUNX family of transcription
factors, which are tissue-specific regulatory proteins
involved in the control of hematopoiesis (Runx1/AML1),
osteogenesis (Runx2/AML3), and differentiation of neural
and gastrointestinal cells (Runx3/AML2) [34]. Their N-terminal parts bind specific DNA sequences, whereas the Cterminal domains interact with coregulatory factors and
associate with the nuclear matrix [34], a domain organization similar to that in proteins of the SAP30 family. In
addition, the subcellular localization of proteins of the
two families also bears similarities, as Runx proteins are
focally localized within the nucleus and some of them are
actually found in the nucleolus [35]. Interestingly, the
nuclear matrix association sequence in both protein families is comprised of a stretch of hydrophobic residues
flanked by hydrophilic residues (Figure 6d).
It is now widely accepted that in higher organisms such as
mammals, a particular function is often assigned to a gene
family rather than to a single gene. Many gene families are
thought to have originated by gene duplication at an evolutionary stage when most vertebrates were still aquatic
[36]. The members of a gene family perform the same or
similar function, but in slightly different and overlapping
ways. In the case of the SAP30 family, these subtle differences may be exploited during ontogeny, given the crucial
role reserved for the Sin3A complex in embryogenesis [1].

Conclusion
In this report, we have described the molecular evolution
of the SAP30 protein family and its genesis from a single
chromosome segment duplication event. Our analyses
indicate that the ancestral SAP30L protein is conserved in
animals, plants, fungi and some chloroplast-containing
protists. We have identified many new members of the
SAP30 family from different species and a conserved Cterminal domain which is responsible for association with
the nuclear matrix. The phylogenetic and biochemical
analyses have uncovered functional divergence between
SAP30 and SAP30L in the domain that associates with the
nuclear matrix. These data will facilitate further studies on
the functional role of proteins of the SAP30 family in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/149

Sin3-HDAC corepressor complex, and possibly other
complexes as well.

Methods
Protein sequence searches, gene locus data retrieval and
multiple sequence alignments
Protein Psi-Blast [37] searches with the full length human
SAP30L sequence were performed at the NCBI Web site
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/ on the non-redundant protein sequence database available on December 3,
2007. After six rounds of iteration, SAP30 and SAP30L
orthologs below an E-value of 0.005 (except for Phaeosphaeria nodorum, for which the E-value was 0.011) were
selected from metazoa, plants and fungi, and all redundant sequences were excluded. SAP30 and SAP30L proteins are encoded in four exons, and variable usage of
these exons is reported to yield multiple splicing variants
[38]. It is also predicted that the longer SAP30 and
SAP30L cDNAs are composed of additional spliced-in,
upstream exons. These predicted additional exons (Rattus
norvegicus SAP30L, gi|109490760) were excluded from
our analyses, all of which were done on protein sequences
that contained the four complete exons, for the sake of
clarity. All sequences were collected in FASTA format for
further analysis as shown in Table 1. The identification
and naming of the protein sequences as either SAP30 or
SAP30L is based on the phylogenetic analyses shown in
Figures 3 and 4. The SAP30 and SAP30L sequences were
aligned using the MegAlign 5.06© program (DNASTAR
Inc) with Clustal V [39] or W [40] at default settings. The
alignments were then shaded using the multiple sequence
alignment editor GENEDOC http://www.nrbsc.org/gfx/
genedoc/index.html. Gene locus data were retrieved from
the NCBI Map viewer http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
mapview/.
Phylogenetic analysis and detection of functional
divergence
PHYLIP version 3.67 [41] was used for the phylogenetic
analyses. Distance, parsimony and likelihood analyses
were performed using the protein alignment as input.
Jackknife values were obtained using SEQBOOT and creating 1000 or 100 "delete-half jackknife" data sets. The
distance analysis was performed by using PROTDIST and
subsequently NEIGHBOR with standard parameters, and
the parsimony analysis was performed using PROTPARS
with standard parameters. The Likelihood analysis was
performed by using PROML with standard parameters. In
all cases, the "M" option for the analysis of multiple data
sets created with SEQBOOT was invoked.

We used DIVERGE version 2.0 [42] for detecting type-I
[26] and type-II [27] functional divergence. Clustal W
alignments of the arthropodan and sarcopterygian clades
for SAP30L and the sarcopterygian clade for SAP30 were

created, and a distance analysis with 100 "delete-half jackknife" data set tests was performed using PHYLIP as
described above. It should be noted that we used tetrapod
sequences as representatives of the sarcopterygian clade
due to the lack of sequence data from the Dipnoi (lungfish) and Coelacanthimorpha infra- and subclasses. The
alignment and the neighborjoining tree were used as
input for the functional divergence analyses. P-values
were derived from the θ and standard error values using
the Z-score.
