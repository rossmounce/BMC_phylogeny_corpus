Abstract
Background: Two genotypically and microbiologically distinct strains of Mycobacterium avium subsp.
paratuberculosis (MAP) exist - S and C MAP strains that primarily infect sheep and cattle, respectively. Concentration
of iron in the cultivation medium has been suggested as one contributing factor for the observed microbiologic
differences. We recently demonstrated that S strains have defective iron storage systems, leading us to propose
that these strains might experience iron toxicity when excess iron is provided in the medium. To test this
hypothesis, we carried out transcriptional and proteomic profiling of these MAP strains under iron-replete or
-deplete conditions.
Results: We first complemented M. smegmatisΔideR with IdeR of C MAP or that derived from S MAP and
compared their transcription profiles using M. smegmatis mc2155 microarrays. In the presence of iron, sIdeR
repressed expression of bfrA and MAP2073c, a ferritin domain containing protein suggesting that transcriptional
control of iron storage may be defective in S strain. We next performed transcriptional and proteomic profiling of
the two strain types of MAP under iron-deplete and -replete conditions. Under iron-replete conditions, C strain
upregulated iron storage (BfrA), virulence associated (Esx-5 and antigen85 complex), and ribosomal proteins. In
striking contrast, S strain downregulated these proteins under iron-replete conditions. iTRAQ (isobaric tag for
relative and absolute quantitation) based protein quantitation resulted in the identification of four unannotated
proteins. Two of these were upregulated by a C MAP strain in response to iron supplementation. The iron-sparing
response to iron limitation was unique to the C strain as evidenced by repression of non-essential iron utilization
enzymes (aconitase and succinate dehydrogenase) and upregulation of proteins of essential function (iron
transport, [Fe-S] cluster biogenesis and cell division).
Conclusions: Taken together, our study revealed that C and S strains of MAP utilize divergent metabolic pathways
to accommodate in vitro iron stress. The knowledge of the metabolic pathways these divergent responses play a
role in are important to 1) advance our ability to culture the two different strains of MAP efficiently, 2) aid in
diagnosis and control of Johne’s disease, and 3) advance our understanding of MAP virulence.

Background
Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP),
the causative agent of Johne’s disease (JD) of ruminants,
often requires eight to sixteen weeks to see colonies in
culture - a major hurdle in the diagnosis and therefore
in implementation of optimal control measures. Unlike
other mycobacteria, which mobilize iron via mycobactins, MAP is unable to produce detectable mycobactin

in vitro or in vivo [1-3]. Although the reasons for the
in :vitro mycobactin dependency of MAP are currently
unknown, we have recently shown that the mycobactin
(mbt) operon promoter is active and that the mycobactin genes are transcribed by MAP inside macrophages
[4] and in tissues of naturally infected animals (accepted
for publication in BMC Genomics).
Pathogenic mycobacteria encounter a wide variety of
stressors inside the host cells and their ability to overcome iron deprivation and iron toxicity represents a
major virulence determinant [5]. Transcript and protein

in vitro iron stress is well documented [6-9]. While
MAP transcriptome or proteome profiles in response to
heat shock, pH, oxidative stress, hypoxia, and nutrient
starvation have been demonstrated [10-12], stress
responses to iron supplementation or starvation are
lacking.
Iron dependent regulator (IdeR) has been very well
studied as a global regulator involved in maintaining
iron homeostasis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)
[13]. Recently we have demonstrated that IdeR of MAP
in the presence of iron recognizes a consensus sequence
on the promoter called “iron box” and regulates expression of genes involved in iron acquisition (mbt) and storage (bfrA). More interestingly, we demonstrated that
polymorphisms in the promoter of iron storage gene
(bfrA) in S MAP strains relative to C MAP strains
results in a differential gene regulation [4]. IdeR dependent repression of bfrA in the presence of iron suggests
variations in iron storage mechanisms and/or iron
requirements in cattle and sheep MAP strains.
Comparative genomic hybridizations, short sequence
repeat analysis and single nucleotide polymorphisms of
MAP isolates obtained from diverse host species have
established and indexed genomic differences between C
and S strains of MAP [14-19]. Phylogenetic analysis of
sequences has identified C and S strains as separate
pathogenic clones that share a common ancestor
[20-23]. Furthermore, cellular infection studies show distinctive phenotypes between the two MAP strain types
[24,25]. We also recently demonstrated that S strains
have defective iron storage systems, leading us to propose that these strains might experience iron toxicity
when excess iron is provided in the medium [4]. Taken
together, the literature suggests that MAP strains vary
in their iron dependent gene regulation. To test this
further, we profiled their transcriptomes and proteomes
in response to iron and demonstrated that iron induced
metabolic pathways are significantly diverse.

Methods
Bacterial strains, DNA manipulations and media

Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis strains
MAP1018 (C MAP) and MAP7565 (S MAP) were
grown in Middlebrook 7H9 supplemented with OADC
enrichment medium and mycobactin J (2 mg/mL; Allied
Monitor, Fayette, MO).
To test the hypothesis that gene regulation may be
dependent on iron availability MAP strains were grown
in Middlebrook 7H9 medium without mycobactin J or
Sauton medium (0.5 g KH2 PO4 , 0.5 g MgSO4 , 4.0 g Lasparagine, 60 ml glycerol, 0.05 g ferric ammonium
citrate, 2.0 g citric acid, 0.1 ml 1% (w/v) ZnSO4 and 2.5
ml 20% Tween 80 in 1 liter). Growth of MAP strains in
the absence of mycobactin J took over 6 months to

provide sufficient material for proteomics and transcriptional profiling. For iron restriction, 2,2’-dipyridyl (Sigma
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was added at a concentration of
200 μM.
MAP7565 and MAP1018 have been genotyped by SSR
as well as comparative genomics using oligoarrays. They
represent the typical genomotypes of sheep and cattle
strains, respectively [18] and show distinct phenotypes
in both human and bovine macrophages [24,25].
M. smegmatis (mc2155) and E. coli TOP10F (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) competent cells were
grown in Luria Bertani (LB) medium and antibiotics
(kanamycin (20 μg/ml) or hygromycin (100 μg/ml))
were added when necessary. The open reading frames of
ideR (MAP2827) derived from C or S MAP strains were
cloned into pSM417 and M. smegmatisΔideR (SM3) was
complemented as previously reported [4]. Briefly,
MAP2827 from MAP1018 (cideR) or MAP 7565 (sideR)
was amplified via PCR using primers that carried restriction sites for BamHI and HindIII. Amplified products
were double digested with BamHI and HindIII and
ligated into a pre digested (BamHI and HindIII) expression plasmid pSM417. Accuracy of the ligation and
orientation of MAP2827 in pSM417 was verified by
sequencing. SM3 was transformed with pSM417 carrying MAP2827 from C or S MAP strains.
A seed stock from logarithmically grown (OD 600 =
1.0) cultures were diluted to fresh medium to yield an
OD 600 = 0.1. These were grown in various aliquots
under constant shaking (120 rpm) at 37°C. These cultures were monitored for their growth at weekly intervals by measuring their absorbance at 600 nm wave
length using SpectraMax M2 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) until they reached an absorbance of 1.0
(Additional file 1, Figure S1). At this point, the cultures
were then pelleted, washed in ice cold 1XPBS and resuspended in fresh culture medium (with or without the
addition of 2,2’-dipyridyl (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO)). Dipyridyl was added at a concentration of 200
μM. Following three hours of incubation at 37°C under
constant shaking, cells were pelleted and washed with
ice cold 1X PBS and either used in microarrays or
iTRAQ. The detailed experimental design is provided as
Additional file 1, Figure S2.
Nucleic acid and protein extraction

Log phase MAP or M. smegmatis cultures were pelleted,
washed and re-suspended in fresh culture medium with
or without 200 μM of 2,2’-dipyridyl. The cultures were
incubated at 37°C with shaking for 3 hr. immediately
prior to RNA and protein extraction.
For RNA, cells were homogenized in Mini bead-beater
for 4 min. by adding 0.3 ml of 0.1 mm sterile RNasefree zirconium beads followed by extraction using Trizol

(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). All samples were treated
with RNase-free DNase I (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX) to
eliminate genomic DNA contamination. The purity and
yield of total RNA samples was confirmed using Agilent
2100E Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa
Clara, CA). RNA was stored at -80 until used in microarrays and real time RT-PCR assays.
For protein, cells were re-suspended in minimal quantity (250 μL) of iTRAQ dissolution buffer (0.5 M TEAB
pH 8.5) and 0.1% SDS. The solution was transferred to
a 2 ml screw cap tube containing 0.1 mm zirconium
beads (Biospec) and disrupted in minibead beater (Biospec) for 4 × 1 minute pulses with samples kept on ice
between pulses. The lysate was then centrifuged at
12,000 × g for 10 minutes at 4°C. Supernatant was
transferred to a fresh tube without disturbing the pellet
and used in iTRAQ labeling for detection of proteome
(Additional file 1, Figure S3).
Microarray experiments

Gene expression profiling of S (1018) and C (7565)
MAP strains was performed using MAP K-10 microarrays obtained from Dr. Michael Paustian, NADC, IA.
Expression profiling of M. smegmatisΔideR complemented with c or sideR was carried out using M. smegmatis
mc2155 arrays provided via Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource Center (PFGRC) at J. Craig Venter Institute (JCVI). Array hybridizations and analyses were
performed as described previously and according to the
protocols established at PFGRC with minor modifications [26] and according to MIAME 2.0 guidelines.
Briefly, synthesis of fluorescently labeled cDNA (Cyanine-3 or Cyanine-5) from total RNA and hybridizations
of labeled cDNA to MAP K-10 or mc 2 155 oligoarray
was performed. Microarray hybridizations were performed from cDNA isolated from two independent
experiments. On each independent occasion, bacterial
cultures growing under iron-replete or iron-limiting
medium were used for RNA extractions, cDNA labeling
and array hybridizations. Each slide was competitively
hybridized with cDNA obtained from iron-replete
(labeled with cy3 or cy5) and iron-limiting growth medium (counter labeled with cy5 or cy3) to reveal relative
expressional differences. About 4 μg (2 μg each from
iron limitation or sufficient) of cDNA was used to hybridize onto the array. However, if the cDNA yield is low
for a sample the RNA from the same sample was used
to synthesize more cDNA, pooled and labeled onto the
arrays. Hybridized slides were scanned using HP Scan
array 5000 (PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA). The
images were processed and numerical data was
extracted using the microarray image analysis software,
BlueFuse (BlueGnome Ltd, Cambridge) and TM4 microarray suite available through JCVI. Genes differentially

regulated at a fold change of 1.5 or greater were identified at a false discovery rate of 1% by Statistical Analysis
of Microarrays (SAM) program [26]. Genes that showed
a fold change 1.5 or greater in all the replicate arrays
were retained and reported as being up- or downregulated in the presence of iron.
Realtime RT-PCR

RNA isolated from MAP strains grown under ironreplete or iron-limiting growth medium was used in real
time RT-PCR assays. Genes were selected based on their
diverse roles and microarray expression pattern. Selected
genes included siderophore transport (MAP2413c,
MAP2414c), esx-3 secretion system (MAP3783,
MAP3784), aconitase (MAP1201c), fatty acid metabolism (MAP0150c) and virulence (MAP0216, MAP3531c,
MAP1122 and MAP0475). RNA was treated with DNaseI (Ambion, Austin, TX) and one step Q-RT PCR was
performed using QuantiFast SYBR Green mix (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) and gene specific primers (Additional file
1, Table S1) in a Lightcycler 480 (Roche, Indianapolis,
IN).
iTRAQ experiments

Protein extracted from the two MAP strains grown in
iron-replete or iron-limiting medium was used in
iTRAQ analysis (Additional file 1, Figure S3). iTRAQ
labeling and protein identification was carried out as
described previously with minor modifications [27].
Briefly, cell lysate was quantified using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL) prior
to trypsin digestion. Peptides were labeled with iTRAQ
reagents (114 and 115 for MAP 1018 grown in ironreplete and iron-limiting medium respectively; 116 and
117 for MAP 7565 grown in iron-replete and iron-limiting medium respectively) at lysine and arginine amino
terminal groups. The labeled peptides were pooled,
dried and re-suspended in 0.2% formic acid. The re-suspended peptides were passed through Oasis® MCX 3CC
(60 mg) extraction cartridges per manufacturer recommendations (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) for
desalting prior to strong cation exchange (SCX)
fractionation.
Eluted peptides were dried and dissolved in SCX buffer A (20% v/v ACN and 5 mM KH2PO4 pH 3.2, with
phosphoric acid) and fractionated using a polysulfoethyl
A column (150 mm length × 1.0 mm ID, 5 μm particles,
300 Å pore size) (PolyLC Inc., Columbia, MD) on a
magic 2002 HPLC system (Michrom BioResources, Inc.,
Auburn, CA). Peptides were eluted by running a 0-20%
buffer B gradient for greater than 55 min. and 20%100% buffer B (20% v/v ACN, 5 mM KH2PO4 pH 3.2,
500 mM KCL) for 20 min. at a column flow rate of 50
μl/min. Several fractions were collected at frequent

intervals and seven fractions that showed mAU280 > 2
were analyzed by LC-MS/MS as previously described
[28].
Fractions were reconstituted in reversed-phase load
buffer (10 mM phosphate buffer) and analyzed in a
4800 MALDI TOF/TOF instrument (AB Sciex, Foster
City, CA). Protein pilot Software™ 3.0.1 (AB Sciex, Foster city, CA) which utilizes the paragon™ scoring algorithm [29] was used to identify and quantify the relative
abundance of the labeled peptides. Relative abundance
of proteins (iron-replete v/s iron-limitation) for each
MAP strain was determined by comparing the reporter
ion ratios (114/115 for C and 116/117 for S MAP).
iTRAQ experiments were repeated on two independent
experiments for each treatment of each strain. We
searched against the MAP K-10, non redundant (nr)
mycobacteria proteins and entire nr protein database
deposited in the NCBI along with the contaminants to
identify MAP specific peptides at a false discovery rate
of 1%.

Results
Transcriptional profiling of MAP IdeR

We recently characterized MAP IdeR and computationally predicted that IdeR in the presence of iron regulates
expression of 24 genes [4]. In the current study, we
identified that 20 of the 24 previously predicted genes
were differentially expressed in response to iron by
MAP microarrays. Mycobactin synthesis, transport and
fatty acid biosynthesis genes were repressed in the presence of iron by both cattle and sheep MAP strains
(Additional file 1, Table S2). However iron storage and
oxidoreductase genes were upregulated in the presence
of iron only in C MAP (Additional file 1, Figure S4).
We first confirmed if these differences are due to regulation via IdeR. IdeR is essential in MAP and attempts
to delete this gene failed [26]. We complemented M.
smegmatisΔideR (SM3) with C or S strain ideR and
compared regulational differences in the presence or
absence of iron. Genes that showed a log2 fold change
of 1.0 in SM3 or SM3 complemented with empty plasmid (negative controls) in the presence or absence of
iron while having a fold change >± 1.5 in the complemented strains (test) and plasmid carrying M. smegmatis
ideR and mc2155 (wild type) (positive control) were considered as being regulated by MAP IdeR. Fourteen of
the 20 genes were regulated by IdeRs of both MAP
strains in M. smegmatis. Furthermore, our results suggested that sIdeR functions by primarily repressing
genes in the presence of iron whereas cIdeR functions
both by repressing mycobactin synthesis and de-repressing iron storage genes in the presence of iron (Additional file 1, Table S3). These were further validated by
realtime RT-PCR in both M. smegmatis transformants

carrying MAP ideRs and MAP genetic background. The
data is presented only for MAP (Additional file 1, Table
S4).
We next compared the transcriptome and proteomes
of C and S MAP strains under iron-replete and ironlimiting conditions. Transcriptome analysis under two
independent observations identified that 94 and 57
genes were consistently expressed by the C and S MAP
strain respectively. Similarly, proteome data revealed a
consistent expression of 64 and 60 proteins by the cattle
and sheep MAP strains respectively. A comparison of
these consistently detected transcripts and proteins
revealed that, in the presence of iron, one third of the
differentially regulated genes (P < 0.05) were represented
both in the respective transcriptome and the proteomes
of the two strains (Figure 1).
Transcript profiles under iron-limiting conditions

Under iron-limiting conditions both the MAP strains
showed increased transcription of genes belonging to
mycobactin synthesis and esx-3, an essential secretory
system of mycobactin biosynthesis (Additional file 1,
Tables S2 - S5) [30].
C MAP showed increased transcription of genes
belonging to ABC type transporter proteins, suf operon
involved in Fe-S cluster assembly proteins (MAP1187MAP1192), fatty acid biosynthesis operon (MAP3188MAP3190) and a pyruvate dehydrogenase operon
(MAP2307c-MAP2309c) (Table 1 and Additional file 1,
Table S5) suggesting that the transcriptional machinery
is used to mobilize iron to maintain intracellular homeostasis. CMAP also upregulated expression of an
enhanced intracellular survival gene (eis) (MAP2325),
which was described as “deletion 3” in sheep strains of
MAP [16].
In contrast, the sheep strain of MAP in addition to
upregulation of putative iron uptake and transport genes
also expressed those belonging to heat shock proteins,
molecular chaperones, and a VapBC family of toxinantitoxin operon (MAP2027c, MAP2028c) suggesting
that iron deprivation might lead to a stringency
response (Table 2 and Additional file 1, Table S6).
Transcript profiles under iron-replete conditions

There is increased protein synthesis and turnover in
response to iron in M. tuberculosis (MTB) [31]. Similarly, the C strain upregulated as many as 25 rRNA
genes, lipid metabolism, and several virulence-associated
genes such as fbpA (MAP0216) of antigen85 complex,
soluble secreted antigen (MAP2942c), and oxidoreductase (MAP1084c) (Tables 3 and Additional file 1, Table
S7). There was also an upregulation of MAP3296c, a
whiB ortholog of M. tuberculosis that plays a role in
antibiotic resistance and maintains intracellular redox

(Additional file 1, Table S4).
Proteome

diagram showing the comparison of transcripts and proteins that

only in pathogenic mycobacteria and plays a role in cellcell migration of mycobacteria was upregulated [33]. A
hypothetical protein (MAP0860c) upregulated in the
presence of iron in the cattle strain of MAP has been
described as a part of MAP-specific large sequence polymorphism (LSP4) [22].
In contrast, we did not document any upregulation (at
a log 2 fold change of 1.5) in the S MAP under ironreplete conditions. The directionality of transcripts as

The following criteria were used for protein identification in each treatment - (1) peptides identified by mass
spectrometry were searched against the non-redundant
(nr) protein database deposited in NCBI); and (2) MAP
specific peptides reported with >95% confidence were
used to quantify the relative abundance (iron-replete v/s
iron-limitation) of each protein. A peptide with no hits
on the MAP genome but with identities with other
mycobacterial proteins was considered as unannotated
MAP protein.
Protein expression under iron-limiting conditions

Consistent with the transcription profile, the C strain of
MAP upregulated proteins belonging to SUF operon
involved in Fe-S cluster assembly, fatty acid metabolism
and a pyruvate dehydrogenase (MAP2307c). Transporter
proteins, two component systems, and cell division associated proteins (MAP1906c, MAP0448 and MAP2997c)
were also upregulated by the C strain (Table 1 and
Additional file 1, Table S8). The sheep strain also upregulated transporter proteins, fatty acid biosynthesis,
DNA replication protein (MAP3433), and stress
response proteins (MAP3831c, MAP2764) (Table 2,
Additional file 1, Table S9 and Figure S3).

The iron-sparing response to iron starvation occurs
when non-essential iron utilization proteins such as aconitase and succinate dehydrogenases are repressed and
intracellular iron is used to maintain essential cellular
functions [34,35]. Interestingly, during iron limitation,
the cattle strain but not sheep MAP downregulated
expression of aconitase (MAP1201c) and succinate
dehydrogenases (MAP3697c, MAP3698c) (Figure 2).
Repression of aconitase in response to iron starvation is
post-transcriptionally mediated via small RNAs [36].
Consistent with this finding, our results reveal an upregulation of aconitase transcripts (both by microarray
and Q-RT PCR) with a concomitant downregulation at
the protein level in the C MAP alone under iron-limiting conditions.
Protein expression under iron-replete conditions

The sheep strain upregulated as many as 13 unique peptides (>95% confidence) that were mapped to
MAP2121c. A representative peptide map is shown in
Figure 3A. Interestingly, none of these were differentially
regulated in response to iron by C strain of MAP.
MAP2121c was originally described as 35-kDa antigen
and is an immune-dominant protein involved in MAP

entry into bovine epithelial cells [37,38]. Although statistically not significant, further microarray analysis
revealed a two-fold increase of MAP2121c in both cattle
and sheep strains under iron-replete conditions (data
not shown) suggesting a possible post transcriptional
repression of MAP2121c by the cattle strain of MAP.
As expected, transcripts identified as upregulated
under iron-replete conditions in C MAP strain were
also upregulated in the proteome (Table 3, Additional
file 1, Table S10). There was increased expression of five
ribosomal proteins and a ribosome releasing factor
(MAP2945c) by cattle MAP under iron-replete conditions. As previously reported, BfrA was upregulated in
cattle MAP (Figure 3B). Antigen 85A and MAP0467c
(mycobacterial heme, utilization and degrader) were also
upregulated. However, MAP0467c and other stress
response proteins were downregulated in the S MAP
strain (Figure 4).

(DAVELPFLHK and EYALRPPK) that did not map to
any of the annotated MAP proteins but to the amino
acid sequence of MAV_2400. Further examination of
the MAP genome revealed that the peptides map to the

that were translated from other unannotated MAP

Discussion
Johne’s disease is a major animal health problem of
ruminant species worldwide and imposes significant
economic losses to the industry. Our ability to culture

the causative agent–Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP)–and therefore its rapid diagnosis
and our understanding of its virulence is limited. MAP
is difficult to culture because of its unusually strict iron
requirements. For optimal growth in laboratory media,
MAP requires a siderophore (mycobactin) supplementation that makes MAP fastidious [39]., often requiring
eight to sixteen weeks to produce colonies in culture - a
major hurdle in the diagnosis and therefore implementation of optimal control measures. Understanding iron
regulatory networks in the pathogen invitro is therefore
of great importance.
A tale of two strain types of MAP - A case to study iron
regulation

Several microbiological and genotyping studies and clinical observations suggest that Johne’s in certain hosts
such as sheep, goats, deer, and bison is caused by a distinct set of strains that show a relatively high degree of
host preference [18,40]. At least two microbiologically
distinct types of MAP have been recognized. A less
readily cultivable type is the common, but not invariable, cause of paratuberculosis in sheep (S MAP)
[39,41,42], while another readily cultivable type is the
most common cause of the disease in cattle (C MAP).
Cell infection studies have also revealed distinctive host
response phenotypes between cattle and sheep MAP
strains - the former elicit primarily a pro-inflammatory

S MAP strains under iron-replete conditions: Reporter ion
regions (114 - 117 m/z) of peptide tandem mass spectrum from
iTRAQ labeled peptides from the (A) 35-kDa major membrane

MAP1508-1509 and MAP2566-2567c. Quantitation of peptides and
inferred proteins are made from relative peak areas of reporter ions.
Several unique peptides (>95% confidence) were mapped to each
protein. However, only one representative peptide is shown for
each protein. Peptides obtained from cattle MAP cultures grown in
iron-replete and iron-limiting medium were labeled with 114 and
115 reporter ions, respectively. Peptides obtained from sheep MAP
cultures grown in iron-replete and iron-limiting medium were
labeled with 116 and 117 reporter ions, respectively. The peptide

response while latter strains suppress inflammation and
upregulate anti-apoptotic pathways [24,25]. In addition,
since MAP genome sequence was published in 2005,
very little research has focused on iron physiology and
its contribution to metabolic networks of this fastidious
organism.
Based on these classical microbiologic, genotypic, and
clinical observations, we addressed the hypothesis that
the iron dependent gene regulation is different between
cattle and sheep MAP strains using a systems approach.
Iron-sparing response to iron-limitation is unique to
cattle MAP strain

Iron is a critical component of several metabolic
enzymes [43]. Most bacteria respond to iron starvation
with a unique regulatory mechanism called the ironsparing response [35]. Iron-sparing is a physiological
phenomenon used by cells to increase the intracellular
iron pool by post-transcriptionally repressing the synthesis of non-essential iron using proteins and sparing
iron for essential cellular functions [44]. Therefore, the

conditions: Proteins upregulated in cattle MAP strain whereas
downregulated in sheep strain in the presence of iron. Fold change
for each target is calculated and represented as a ratio of ironreplete/iron-limitation. A negative fold change represents repression
and a positive fold change indicates de-repression of that particular
target gene in the presence of iron. MhuD = mycobacterial heme
utilization, degrader; USP = universal stress protein; CHP =
conserved hypothetical protein; MIHF = mycobacterial integration
host factor; CsbD = general stress response protein

paradigm is to transcriptionally upregulate all iron
uptake systems while repressing non-essential enzymes
via post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms to survive iron-limiting conditions. Both MAP strains upregulated genes involved in siderophore biosynthesis (mbt),
ability to acquire iron from synthesized siderophores
(esx-3), and to transport iron bound siderophores
(irtAB) into the bacterium (Additional file 1, Table S2).
Furthermore, cattle MAP strain under iron-limiting conditions upregulated transcription of aconitase (Additional file 1, Table S4) while downregulating its protein
expression (Figure 2). It is likely that targets for posttranscriptional repression of these non-essential iron
using proteins are mediated via small RNAs [34]. Studies to test this hypothesis in the two MAP strain types
are underway.
Differential metabolic responses of cattle and sheep MAP
strains to iron-limitation

Under iron-limiting conditions most other bacteria
including M. tuberculosis (MTB) upregulate SUF operon
[26,45]. SUF synthesizes [Fe-S] clusters and transports
them to iron-sulfur containing proteins involved in
diverse cellular functions such as redox balance and
gene regulation [46]. This is critical because unlike E.
coli, MTB and MAP genomes encode for only one such
system to synthesize all the [Fe-S] needed by the cell
and free iron and sulfide atoms are toxic to cells [47].
Our data revealed that cattle strain, but not S strain

Figure 5 Iron dependent metabolic programming in cattle and sheep MAP: Under iron-replete conditions, there is upregulation of
ribosomal proteins, bacterioferritin, mycobacterial heme, utilization and degrader proteins in cattle strain alone. Under iron limiting conditions,
siderophore synthesis and transport genes are upregulated in both cattleI and sheep MAP strains. However, under iron limitation there is
downregulation of aconitase, succinate dehydrogenases and superoxide dismutase in cattle MAP strain alone. This suggests an iron-sparing
response exclusively in cattle but not sheep strain.

upregulated SUF operon at the transcript and protein
level under iron-limiting conditions (Table 1).
Cattle MAP strain upregulated pyruvate dehydrogenase operon involved in catabolism of propionate a key
component of lipid biosynthesis under limiting iron conditions [48]. In contrast, sheep strain upregulated isoprenoid synthesis genes involved in cell wall biogenesis
[49]. The sheep isolate also upregulated oxidoreductase
and stress responses in its transcriptome and proteome
during iron-limitation (Table 2). CarD and toxin-antitoxin systems primarily function during unfavorable
conditions such as starvation or oxidative stress by
arresting cell growth [50,51]. Sheep strain upregulated
transcripts of toxin-antitoxin system involved in arresting cell growth, suggesting a trend toward stringency
response (Additional file 1, Table S6). Taken together,
our data suggests that cattle strain is able to efficiently
modulate its metabolism during iron-limitation - probably a survival advantage.
MAP2325, a hypothetical protein deleted in the sheep
strain was found to be upregulated under iron-limiting
conditions by the C strain (Additional file 1, Table S5).
This is interesting because an ortholog of MAP2325 in
MTB called enhanced intracellular survival (eis)

interacts with host T cells. Stimulation of recombinant
Eis from MTB results in increased production of IL-10
and decreased production of TNF-a thus contributing
to mycobacterial survival inside macrophages [52]. We
have also demonstrated a similar result in bovine or
human macrophages stimulated with diverse MAP
strains. Cattle strains produced relatively more IL-10
and less TNF-a and persisted for longer periods of time
inside macrophages [24,25].
There is increased protein synthesis and turn over in
response to iron in MTB [31]. Similarly, we observed an
increased expression of ribosomal proteins in the transcriptome and proteome in C MAP under iron-replete
conditions. In striking contrast, iron-limitation induced
a similar theme in sheep strain. Heme degradation is a
significant physiological phenomenon where in pathogens recycle iron and gain a survival advantage inside
the host [53]. Recently the crystal structure of Rv3592 of
MTB was solved and demonstrated its ability as heme
degrader [54]. We observed an upregulation of
MAP0467c protein (ortholog of Rv3592) under ironreplete conditions in C MAP while it was downregulated
in the sheep strain (Figure 4). Similar to our previous
reports, iron storage protein, BfrA was upregulated only

Janagama et al. BMC Microbiology 2010, 10:268
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/10/268

by C MAP under iron-repletion (Figure 3) [4]. Although
the reasons for differential iron storage mechanisms in
sheep compared to cattle strains of MAP are currently
unknown, differential role of ferritins in bacterial pathogens is not uncommon [55].

Conclusions
Our data revealed striking differences in metabolic pathways used by cattle and sheep strains of MAP to adapt
to iron starvation (Figure 5). We have identified and
characterized key iron dependent pathways of MAP.
Since iron metabolism is critical for the invivo and invitro survival of the bacterium, our current studies are
expected to improve our ability to provide better invitro
culture methods for MAP and provide an understanding
of iron regulation as a key virulence determinant of
MAP.
