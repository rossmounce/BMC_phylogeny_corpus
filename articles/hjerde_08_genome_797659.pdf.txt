Abstract
Background: The fish pathogen Aliivibrio salmonicida is the causative agent of cold-water vibriosis
in marine aquaculture. The Gram-negative bacterium causes tissue degradation, hemolysis and
sepsis in vivo.
Results: In total, 4 286 protein coding sequences were identified, and the 4.6 Mb genome of A.
salmonicida has a six partite architecture with two chromosomes and four plasmids. Sequence
analysis revealed a highly fragmented genome structure caused by the insertion of an extensive
number of insertion sequence (IS) elements. The IS elements can be related to important
evolutionary events such as gene acquisition, gene loss and chromosomal rearrangements. New A.
salmonicida functional capabilities that may have been aquired through horizontal DNA transfer
include genes involved in iron-acquisition, and protein secretion and play potential roles in
pathogenicity. On the other hand, the degeneration of 370 genes and consequent loss of specific
functions suggest that A. salmonicida has a reduced metabolic and physiological capacity in
comparison to related Vibrionaceae species.
Conclusion: Most prominent is the loss of several genes involved in the utilisation of the
polysaccharide chitin. In particular, the disruption of three extracellular chitinases responsible for
enzymatic breakdown of chitin makes A. salmonicida unable to grow on the polymer form of chitin.
These, and other losses could restrict the variety of carrier organisms A. salmonicida can attach to,
and associate with. Gene acquisition and gene loss may be related to the emergence of A.
salmonicida as a fish pathogen.

Background
Aliivibrio salmonicida (formerly Vibrio salmonicida) is a facultative pathogen of fish responsible for causing coldwater vibriosis (CV) in farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo
salar), sea farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)
and captive Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) [1]. At the peak
of its prevalence in the 1980s infected fish farms suffered
heavy losses reaching 50–90% [2]. CV appeared to be
effectively controlled in 1998 [3] but before vaccination
was introduced, A. salmonicida was estimated to have been
responsible for over 80% of disease related losses to the
Norwegian aquaculture industry [4]. Although the impact
of A. salmonicida on the aquaculture industry is primarily
on salmonoids there is concern it poses a risk to new commercially important species for which farming is at an
early stage or is planned. The decline in the wild Atlantic
cod population has lead to a massive expansion of cod
aquaculture. In Norway alone 7410 tons of farmed cod
were sold in 2005, which is more than twice the amount
from previous year [5]. So far the cod farming industry has
only suffered a few outbreaks of CV, and only in unvaccinated fish. However, despite this successful treatment the
CV vaccine is administered by intraperitoneal injection
and its use is associated with severe side-effects such as
impaired growth, intra-abdominal lesions [6] and adhesions in the abdominal cavity of the fish that may affect
physiological functions and reduce the quality of the final
product [7]. Hence, alternative approaches and vaccines
are essential.
The halophilic and psychrophilic bacterium belongs to
Vibrionaceae, which includes 85 species found in a wide
range of aquatic environments in free-living forms and
attached to both biotic and abiotic surfaces. Plankton
organisms, mainly copepods, host large populations of
bacteria. The attachment to zooplankton may enhance
environmental survival of Vibrionaceae which are able to

break down the chitinaceous exoskeleton and utilize the
polysaccharides as an abundant source of carbon and
nitrogen [8]. Vibrionaceae are also found associated with,
and are pathogens of, other aquatic organisms such as
fish, mussels, corals, molluscs, seagrass, shrimps and
squid [9]. Currently the genome sequences of nine Vibrionaceae have been published. We report here the complete
genome sequence of the first fish pathogenic Vibrionaceae.
During an infection A. salmonicida elicits tissue degradation, hemolysis and sepsis. Clinical symptoms such as
severe anaemia and extensive haemorrhages on the surface of all internal organs of the fish are commonly
observed. However, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that produce the pathology of these
infections and the genome should provide an insight into
evolution and mechanisms involved in mediating the disease. The cod isolate A. salmonicida strain LFI1238 taken
from the head kidney (lymphoid organ) of a diseased fish
was chosen for sequencing in order to better understand
pathogen-host interactions.

Results and discussion
I. General features of the genome
The general features of the A. salmonicida strain LFI1238
(LFI1238) genome are summarized in Table 1. The
genomic G+C content of 39.6% is relatively low in comparison to other sequenced Vibrionaceae. Characteristically for members of Vibrionaceae [10] the A. salmonicida
genome consists of two circular chromosomes of 3.3 and
1.2 Mb (chr I and chr II respectively) (Figure 1). The presence of essential genes on chr II indicates that this replicon is not a dispensable megaplasmid [11]. However
unlike the other Vibrionaceae sequenced LFI1238 also carries four circular plasmids designated pVSAL840 (83.5
kb), pVSAL320 (30.8 kb), pVSAL54 (5.4 kb) and pVSAL43
(4.3 kb) which represent 2.7% of the total genomic DNA

and harbour 111 protein coding sequences (CDSs; Table
1 and [Additional file 1A]).
The functional distribution of CDSs between the chromosomes is similar to that reported for other Vibrionaceae
[12]: chr I carries the majority of CDSs needed for DNA
replication, cell division, biosynthesis of amino acids and
nucleotides. Conversely, the majority of CDSs involved in
adapting to environmental changes, such as stress
response functions, proteins associated with the cell envelope and proteins that could not be assigned any function
are encoded on chr II (Figure 2). From similarity searches
comparing all of the LFI1238 CDSs against the CDSs from
the other published Vibrionaceae genomes, it is apparent
that A. salmonicida shares more orthologous genes with
Aliivibrio fischeri (70%) than the other Vibrionaceae compared (average 55–60% shared orthologs). These observations are consistent with 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis

data [13] and support the reclassification of these two species, together with Aliivibrio wodanis and Aliivibrio logei as
a separate genus [14].
The presence of multiple plasmids is characteristic of A.
salmonicida [15] with many which are common to isolates
from diverse geographical areas in the North Atlantic
Ocean (Norway, Canada, the Shetland Islands, Faroe
Islands). From plasmid profiles plasmids of the same size
as pVSAL43, pVSAL54 and pVSAL320 are common to isolates from all of the above regions. However, LFI1238
pVSAL840 appears to be restricted to isolates from the
northern parts of Norway where it is found in strains
alongside either pVSAL43, pVSAL54 and pVSAL320, or
together with pVSAL320 [16]. pVSAL840 harbours a tra
locus containing 21 CDSs with functions related to plasmid conjugation. This region is highly syntenic with the
tra locus of the conjugation plasmid pYJ016 identified in

Vibrio vulnificus [17] and plasmid pES100 in A. fischeri
[18], and suggests a similar function involved in conjugation for pVSAL840.
Plasmids pVSAL43 and pVSAL54 are predicted to encode
acyltransferases. Acyltransferases have the potential to
change the acetylation state of the lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) and so maybe important in providing antigenic variability of the cell surface to give better protection against

the host antibody immune recognition [19]. In a recent
study, the expression of an iron ABC transporter harboured on pVSAL320 was shown to be dependent upon
iron and probably regulated by the ferric uptake regulator
Fur [20]. pVSAL320 may therefore be important for the
non-siderophore based uptake of ferrous iron. Valla and
colleagues (1992) showed that a plasmid cured strain of
A. salmonicida when injected through the intraperetoneal
route was still able to cause CV in salmon [21]. Therefore

although these plasmids may contribute to colonisation
and virulence they are not essential, at least by this route
of infection.
The most striking feature of the A. salmonicida genome is
the high number of insertion sequence (IS) elements relative to other Vibrionaceae. In total A. salmonicida carry 521
CDSs (12.2% of all CDSs) representing 288 whole and
partial IS elements (Table 1), compared to only one IS element in A. fischeri. These IS elements can be subdivided
into 20 different types (denoted VSa1 – VSa20), and fall
into 12 different IS families based on sequence similarities
with defined families in the IS Finder database [22] [see
Additional file 2]. The relative proportion of transposases
is slightly larger in chr II than in chr I (14.8 and 11.4%,
respectively). IS element insertions have disrupted 183
CDSs (4.3% of the total CDSs) in the chromosomes and
plasmids. Most of these "natural knock-outs" are probably not translated to give functional products. The distribution of the IS elements suggests that the IS elements
present in high numbers on the chromosomes have
spread to the plasmids by transposition. However, VSa3
and VSa4 are found exclusively on pVSAL840, VSa19 is
restricted to pVSAL320 and pVSAL54 carries none of the
A. salmonicida IS elements. This suggests that these plasmids do not tolerate insertions or that they are relatively
recent acquisitions and that pVSAL54 is the most recently
acquired. However, Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) analysis, which measures the relative adaptiveness of the
codon usage of genes towards the codon usage of highly
expressed genes [23], revealed that genes on pVSAL840
(0.48) deviate more from the average genome composition (0.58) than the other plasmids (Table 1). In addition
the Codon Bias Index (CBI) versus CAI plot described in
[24] for A. salmonicida clearly showed that genes on
pVSAL840 deviate most from the genome background,
suggesting that this is likely to be the most recent acquired
plasmid [see Additional file 3].
II. Genome structure
Compositional asymmetries (GC deviation) in the leading and lagging strand of DNA, with bias towards G on the
leading strand of the bidirectional replication fork, is a
common characteristic of bacterial genomes [25]. It is evident from Figure 1 that both of the A. salmonicida chromosomes show anomalies in their GC deviation.
Significantly IS elements are found flanking all large
regions showing an aberant GC deviation. Since their
homologous DNA can serve as recombinational crossover points they are likely to be largely responsible for the
apparent anomalies [26]. Consistent with this, whole
genome comparison with A. fischeri also shows that these
anomalous regions represent breaks in synteny [see Additional file 4].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/616

By designing PCR primers to amplify across the borders of
these anomalous regions we discovered that several
genomic configurations may exist within a population of
any given isolate (data not shown). It has been suggested
that this type of interreplichore recombinations have an
effect on the gene dosage, whereby the continual initiation of replication folks leads to genes closer to the origin
being at a higher relative gene dosage than those at the terminus. It has also been shown that gene orientation is
under selection, with essential genes being preferentially
encoded on the leading strand; this is hypothesised to be
due to avoidence of the deleterious effects of collisions
between the transcription and translation machinery [27].
How stable any given genomic configuration is and what
affect this has on transcription in A. salmonicida is yet to
be determined, but similar rapid rearrangements have
been reported in other genomes with high IS element
loads [28].
Interestingly in addition to mediating homologous
recombination, IS elements also border three regions in
the chromosome that are found duplicated in the plasmids [see Additional file 1B]. Two such regions, each
encoding three CDSs from pVSAL840 and pVSAL320
respectively, are the flanking parts of the genomic island
GI-VS1 (Table 2). The duplicated CDSs displayed nucleotide sequence identity up to 100%, and the functions of
most are unknown. The third region carries four CDSs of
which two encode a hemolysin co-regulated protein
(Hcp) and a VgrG protein. Both Hcp and VgrG are virulence effector proteins secreted by the Type VI secretion
system. Codon usage analysis clearly showed that the
duplicated genes cluster more closely to the plasmid genes
than to the genome background [see Additional file 3],
which suggests that the genes originated from the plasmids. Thus this recombination between IS elements represents a mechanism by which to introduce new functions
into the chromosome from a highly variable complement
of plasmids.
1. Gene acquisition
In addition to the plasmids and the IS elements, the
genome of A. salmonicida carries other mobile genetic elements, including nine prophages as well as 16 regions
which have the characteristics of genomic islands (Table
2) [29]. The tailed phage ϕ VS4 present on chr I has an
overall GC content of 40.8%, slightly higher than the
chromosome average (39.8%). The majority of the 43
CDSs show considerable homology and synteny to the
K139 phage of Vibrio cholerae strain O139 [30] [see Additional file 5], but this phage is not found in any of the
other sequenced Vibrionaceae genomes. ϕ VS4 is likely to
be the only complete prophage within the A. salmonicida
genome (Table 2). The remaining 8 prophage-like regions
are likely to be remnants.

2A complete list of the CDSs are provided in [Additional file 10].

In total, 25 regions larger than 5 kb were identified as having atypical DNA compositional and being present in A.
salmonicida but absent the other Vibrionaceae genomes
(Table 2). Although the majority of CDS encoded on these
regions of difference are of no known function, some
encode proteins involved in secretion, biosynthesis of
capsular polysaccharides (CPS) and biosynthesis and
uptake of siderophores [see Additional file 6].
2. Duplications
In addition to the regions duplicated on the plasmids and
chromosomes Chr I also carries an additional perfect
duplication of approximately 29 kb. PCR analysis of 27
different A. salmonicida isolates confirmed the duplication
at the same locations in all tested isolates [see Additional
file 7]. Each duplicate contains 27 genes, the majority
encoding products involved in the biosynthesis of constituents of the LPS. L-rhamnose is present in the O-antigens

of Gram-negative bacteria [31]. Four genes, rmlBADC,
necessary for the conversion of D-glucose 1-phosphate to
dTDP-L-rhamnose are present in the repeat. Seven genes
are similar to those found in the wav gene cluster of V.
cholerae. The wav genes are responsible for the synthesis of
LPS core oligosaccharides [32]. Nesper and colleges suggested that genetic exchange of wav genes could improve
outer membrane stability by altering the structure of the
core LPS. In such case, it would provide for better adaptation to different niches. However, the duplicates in
LFI1238 are identical at the nucleotide level and homologous recombination would therefore not increase the variety of the surface molecules expressed in the bacteria. On
the other hand, in Haemophilus influenzae genes involved
in the capsule expression are located within an 18 kb cap
locus. Up to five copies of the locus have been detected,
and a relationship between the number of copies of the
cap locus and the production of capsule has been demon-

strated [33]. We speculate that the amplification may
increase the gene expression and lead to increased LPS
production. Espelid et al. observed that ball-shaped aggregates containing the protein/lipopolysaccharide VS-P1,
the dominant immunoreactive antigen of A. salmonicida,
were released in large quantities from the bacterial membrane inside the host [34]. It has been suggested that
much of the specific immune response of the fish may be
directed against this "smoke screen" [35]. Increased LPS
production by A. salmonicida could therefore be advantageous when entering a host.
3. Gene loss
In total we identified 185 pseudogenes (4.3% of the total
CDSs) containing frameshift and nonsense mutations
that might disrupt expression of functional products [see
Additional file 3]. Loss of functions seems to occur across
all functional classes of products, but a striking number of
transposases, transport proteins and proteins associated
with the cell envelope are included in this list (Figure 2
and [Additional file 3]).

The accumulation of pseudogenes is high for genes
involved in the utilisation of the polysaccharide chitin.
Chitin (GlcNAc)n is an insoluble homopolymer of Nacetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), and is highly abundant
in marine environments as constituents of the exoskeleton of crustaceans and zooplankton. Chitin is important
for the attachment of bacteria to a carrier organism such
as copepods [36,37] and known to be an important as a
nutrient source [38]. Furthermore in a recent study Hunt
et al. showed that the majority of genes involved in chitin
degradation are conserved among the Vibrionaceae [39].
In A. salmonicida seven of the pseudogenes represent key
components in the chitinolytic cascade (Figure 3 and
[Additional file 8]) including a methyl accepting chemotaxis gene (VSAL_I2601) that may be involved in motility
toward chitin [40], three chitinases (VSAL_I1942,
VSAL_I0902/I0763 and VSAL_I1414) involved in the
extracellular breakdown of chitin to chitin oligosaccharides [41,42], a chitoporin (VSAL_I2352) responsible for
mediating transport of chitin oligosaccharides into the
periplasma [43], and a chitodextrinase (VSAL_I1108)
involved in the periplasmic breakdown of chitin oligosaccharides [44].
In addition, several genes involved in the chitinolytic cascade are regulated by chitin oligosaccharides and a twocomponent chitin catabolic sensor/kinase encoded by
chiS [40,45]. The gene regulation on the transcriptional
level is not known, but the periplasmic chitin binding
protein (CBP) is required for ChiS-regulation (Figure 3).
The CBP orthologue in A. salmonicida (VSAL_I2576) contains a frameshift. The functional loss of genes thought to

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/616

be regulated by ChiS/CBP is likely to have preceded, and
perhaps facilitated, the degeneration of this gene.
To investigate whether the loss of these genes has
impaired the ability of A. salmonicida to utilize chitin, six
A. salmonicida isolates including LFI1238 were grown on a
minimal media containing either α-chitin (GlcNAc)n or
GlcNAc as the only source of carbon. As a control, A.
wodanis and Vibrio splendidus were grown in parallel. None
of the A. salmonicida isolates showed growth on (GlcNAc)n nor on GlcNAc [see Additional file 9]. In contrast,
the majority of controls grew on both the homopolymeric
and monomeric form of GlcNAc. This implies that the
loss of seven genes involved in the chitinolytic cascade
have probably affected processes such as sensing, degradation and transport of chitin and suggests that the ability to
catabolise chitin is no longer required by A. salmonicida.
Consistent with these findings preliminary studies looking for A. salmonicida in the environment have failed to
find this species associated with copepods (personal communication B. Landfald). Accordingly, this could also
confine the variety of carrier organisms A. salmonicida can
attach to, and associate with.
It should be mentioned that programmed frameshifting
and readthrough of premature stop codons are often used
as methods of bacterial gene regulation [46]. In addition,
homopolymeric DNA tracts can give rise to slipped-strand
mispairing during replication [47]. It is therefore possible
that some of the predicted pseudogenes could be translated into functional products, and are retained in the
genome for selective reasons. Two flagellar biosynthesis
genes, fliF (VSAL_I2308) and flaG (VSAL_I2316) are disrupted by premature stop codons. While the function of
flaG is unknown, the product of fliF is the major component of the M-ring, a central motor component of the flagellum. Despite the disruption of fliF and flaG the
sequenced strain is still motile. This could imply that
these genes are not essential in A. salmonicida, or that the
translational machinery is able to read through the premature stop codons and produce functional products.
IV. Quorum sensing
Bacterial cell-to-cell communication, or quorum sensing
(QS) is a sophisticated mechanism that can allow for a
synchronized gene expression of a whole community.
Bacteria can respond to environmental changes by monitoring the presence of other bacteria in the surroundings
by producing and responding to extracellular signal molecules (autoinducers). A. salmonicida has five QS systems
(AinR/S, LuxI/R, VarS/A, LuxM/N and LuxS/PQ), which is
more than reported in any other Vibrionaceae [48]. However, there is extensive evidence of gene loss in these systems: luxN and luxP encoding the autoinducer receptors of
the LuxM/N and LuxS/PQ systems, respectively are pseu-

Key steps in the chitinolytic cascade
Key steps in the chitinolytic cascade. Functional assignment of A. salmonicida CDSs are derived from bioinformatical analysis, and the abbreviated gene IDs are indicated at each step. Putative non-functional A. salmonicida products are boxed. Initially,
a methyl chemotaxis protein (VSAL_II0134) and a chitin binding protein (VSAL_I2601) are involved in sensing and attachment
to chitin respectively. Extracellular chitinases (VSAL_I0763/I0902, VSAL_I1414, VSAL_I1942, VSAL_I0757 and VSAL_II0217)
partly break down chitin. Chitin oligomers (GlcNAc)n are translocated across the outer membrane by chitoporin
(VSAL_I2352), while the transport of monomers and dimers (GlcNAc)1,2 is mediated by unspecific porins. In the periplasm, the
chitin oligomers are further degraded to yield (GlcNAc)1,2 by chitodextrinase (VSAL_I1108), N-acetylglucosamidase
(VSAL_I2583 and VSAL_II0052) and N-acetylhexosamidase (VSAL_II0575). (GlcNAc)1 are transported across the inner membrane by a permease (VSAL_I0831), while the transport of (GlcNAc)2 are mediated by an ABC-transporter (VSAL_I2577I2580). Deacetylated monomers (GlcN) are transported into the cytosol by a PTS transporter (VSAL_I0703- I0708). Cytoplasmic enzymes (VSAL_I2581- I2582, VSAL_I2584- I2585, VSAL_I0830 and VSAL_I2812) convert the transport products into
fructose-6-P, acetate and ammonia. In the absence of chitin, the perisplasmic chitin oligosaccharide binding protein CBP
(VSAL_I2576) binds to the chitin sensor/kinase ChiS (VSAL_I2575) and represses transcription of chitinolytic genes. In presence of chitin, the complex dissociates as CBP binds to the chitin polysaccharides and chitinolytic genes are expressed.

dogenes. In addition, A. salmonicida lacks luxM and luxL,
required for the production of N-(3-hydroxylbutanyol)-Lhomoserine lactone (HHL), the autoinducer of the LuxM/
N system [49] further indicating that this system is nonfunctional. However, since the frameshift within luxN
occurs within a homopolymeric tract (of 6 bp) it is possi-

ble that the function of this gene could be restored by programmed frameshifting. In the absence of LuxM and LuxL
this would allow the system to function as a "mute" system monitoring the presence of HHLs produced by other
bacteria.

V. Potential virulence factors
Little is known about the molecular mechanisms by
which A. salmonicida causes disease. Through detailed
analysis of the genome possible functions that may be
associated with mediating CV have been predicted [see
Additional file 10].

The roles of several important virulence factors have been
described for other Vibrionaceae, such as the cholera toxin
(CT) of V. cholerae [50], the thermostable hemolysin
(TDH) of V. parahaemolyticus [51] and the metalloprotease (VVP) of V. vulnificus [52]. Common for CT, TDH
and VVP is that they act extracellularly, and are exported
from the cell by various secretion mechanisms. Although
none of these factors were found in A. salmonicida, the tissue damage observed in fish with CV suggests that A. salmonicida secrets proteins during an infection like these
other pathogens. Several protein secretion systems were
identified in the genome, including three Type I secretion
systems (T1SS), one Type II secretion system (T2SS), two
Type VI secretion systems (T6SS) and one Flp-type pilus
system.
The CDSs of the Flp-type pilus are harboured on GI-VSA5
and show sequence similarities and high synteny to the
Tad (tight adherence) macromolecular transport system
of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. The tad system is
widely distributed in bacteria and secrets a pilus that is
involved in adherance to surfaces [53]. This function is
necessary for colonization and pathogenesis by A. actinomycetemcomitans. The tad genes are present and intact in A.
salmonicida, A. fischeri,V. parahaemolyticus and an incomplete operon is found in both V. vulnificus strains
sequenced.
Functional gene-loss is evident in one T1SS, and both
T6SSs gene clusters [see Additional file 10]. The products
of the pseudogenes of the T6SSs are not predicted to be
structural components of the secretion apparatus [54]. It
is therefore possible that these systems are functional in A.
salmonicida. T6SSI and T6SSII are located on GI-VS5 and
GI-VS6, respectively. Both systems show sequence similarities as well as considerable synteny to the V. cholerae T6SS
[54]. Virulence effector proteins secreted by T6SS lack an
N-terminal signal sequence and include a hemolysin coregulated protein (Hcp) and a VgrG protein [54]. By
sequence similarity we identified three VgrG
(VSAL_I1358, VSAL_p840_36 and VSAL_I1744) and
three Hcp (VSAL_I1357 and VSAL_I1202) homologs in
the genome. VSAL_I1744 is disrupted by the insertion of
an IS-element and is probably not expressed.
Among the predicted CDSs with the potential to cause tissue degradation and hemolysis in the fish, we have identified two CDSs, VSAL_I0993 and VSAL_I0411 with 77%

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/616

and 52% sequence identity to V. anguillarum hemolysins
VAH2 and VAH5 respectively [see Additional file 10].
VAH2 and VAH5 showed hemolytic activity against fish
erythrocytes and are suggested to contribute to the hemolytic activity of V. anguillarum [55]. To what extent
VSAL_I0993 and VSAL_I0411 can cause hemolysis of fish
blood cells, as observed in fish with CV is unknown. Similar to VAH2 and VAH5, no export signal sequence was
found for VSAL_I0993 and VSAL_I0411. It is possible that
the two putative hemolysins are exported by one or several of the A. salmonicida T1SS. In E. coli, export of hemolysin HlyA is mediated by the hemolysin secretion system,
which has been described as one of the prototypes of T1SS
[56].
A. salmonicida uses the siderophore bisucaberin to acquire
iron [57]. A complete siderophore biosynthesis/acquisition system is contained on GI-VSA3 (VSAL_I0141I0135), but whether it could be responsible for the production of bisucaberin remains to be clarified. We have
also identified a heme uptake system with high sequence
similarity and synteny to that of many other Vibrionaceae
[58]. Both transport of heme complexes, and ferricsiderophores across the outer membrane require a functional TonB system. Several members of Vibrionaceae possess two TonB systems [59,60]. A. salmonicida harbours
three TonB systems, named TonB1, TonB2 and TonB3. In
V. cholerae both TonB systems corresponding to A. salmonicida TonB1 and TonB2 are capable of mediating the
transport of heme and siderophores [59], while in V.
anguillarum only the TonB system homologous to A. salmonicida TonB3 is essential for the ferric-siderophore
transport and virulence [60]. In the TonB1 system, tonB1
(VSAL_I1751) contains a translational frameshift and is
probably not translated into a functional product. All
three TonB systems in A. salmonicida are located adjacent
to CDSs with functions associated with iron-uptake. This
indicates that more than one system may be involved in
iron acquisition.

Conclusion
The A. salmonicida genome displays a mosaic structure
(Figure 1) caused by large intra-chromosomal rearrangements, gene acquisition, deletion and duplication of DNA
within the chromosomes and between the chromosomes
and the plasmids. From our sequence analysis it is clear
that many of these events are mediated by homologous
recombination between IS elements.
Multiple lines of evidence, such as compositional
sequence differences, were used to identify recent gene
acquisitions. The majority of the horizontally acquired
DNA is flanked by IS elements. Although the direct influence the gene acquisitions have had on the evolution and
adaptation of A. salmonicida is not clear, some of the GIs

Page 9 of 14

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:616

carry genes that may have provided new functions to the
bacteria. For example, two T6SS and one Flp-type pilus
system that are involved in the export of proteins are
located on DNA segments that have the typical characteristics of GIs. T6SS have been recognized as a major virulence determinant in other pathogens were they have
been shown to be involved in the extracellular translocation of proteins required for cytotoxicity [54,61]. The Flppilus system is similar to the Tad macromolecular transport system of A. actinomycetemcomitans. The Tad system
has been proposed to represent a new subtype of T2SS and
is essential for biofilm formation, colonization and
pathogenesis [53]. Phylogenetic analysis of the Tad system shows a complex history of gene shuffling and multiple HGT among prokaryotes [62]. Our findings support
the hypothesis that the distribution of the tad genes is
explained by their location on a mobile GI (widespread
colonisation island, WCI) [53]. Whether the protein secretion systems are important for the virulence towards fish
remains to be elucidated.
Over 300 CDSs are disrupted by IS elements or contain
point mutations causing frameshifts or premature stop
codons [Additional file 11]. A large fraction of the degenerate CDSs have roles in the response to environmental
changes and in modulating the host-cell interaction. The
extensive loss of the same types of genes has been reported
for the pathogen species Mycobacterium leprae, Salmonella
Typhi, Bordetella pertussis, and others which have become
host adapted [26,63]. The DNA sequences of these CDSs
are still intact, which indicates that the gene losses are relatively recent events in A. salmonicida. IS expansion has
been related to genome reduction in the evolution and
emergence of pathogenicity [64], and accumulation of
pseudogenes has been described for several other hostrestricted pathogens [26,28,65], supporting the hypothesis that A. salmonicida may have also become hostrestricted through gene loss.
Taken together, the acquisition of novel genes and loss of
old functions may be related to the emergence of A. salmonicida as a pathogenic species for salmonids. The outcome
of the horizontal acquisition of genes could have allowed
for an expansion to a previously unexplored niche, and
the accumulation of pseudogenes and IS expansion resulting in massive loss of functional genes observed in A. salmonicida may be a result of selection against the
expression of genes not required in the new niche, or a
neutral process associated with the relaxation of selective
pressure due to the evolutionary bottleneck associated
with niche adaptation. The observations made for the A.
salmonicida genome are similar to those of other recentlyevolved host-restricted pathogens, suggesting that A. salmonicida has recently made the transition to the specific
niche of fish pathogenicity.

Methods
We applied the whole-genome shotgun strategy to
sequence an environmental isolate of A. salmonicida
(strain LFI1238) from cod provided by Elin Sandaker at
The Norwegian Institute of Fisheries and Aquaculture Ltd.
A single colony of LFI1238 grown on blood agar containing 2.5% NaCl was transferred to marine broth and grown
overnight with shaking at 12°C. Cells were collected and
total DNA (10 mg) was isolated using proteinase K treatment followed by phenol extraction. The DNA was fragmented by sonication, and several libraries were
generated in pUC19 and pMAQ1Sac using size fractions
ranging from 2.2 to 4.0 kb and 4.0 to 12.0 kb, respectively.
The whole genome was sequenced to a depth of 10 times
coverage using dye terminator chemistry on ABI3700
automated sequencers. End sequences from larger insert
plasmid (pBeloBACII, 50–70 kb insert size) libraries were
used as a scaffold.
The sequence was annotated using Artemis software [66].
Initial CDS predictions were performed using Orpheus
[67] and Glimmer2 [68] software. These predictions were
amalgamated, and codon usage, positional base preference methods and comparisons to the non redundant
protein databases using BLAST [69] and FASTA [70] software were used to refine the predictions. The entire DNA
sequence was also compared in all six reading frames
against the nonredundant protein databases, using
BLASTX to identify any possible coding sequences previously missed. Protein motifs were identified using Pfam
[71] and Prosite [72], transmembrane domains were
identified with TMHMM [73], and signal sequences were
identified with SignalP version 2.0 [74]. Stable RNAs were
identified using Rfam [75]. GIs and bacteriophages were
predicted using Alien Hunter [76]. The sequence is available from EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ with the accession numbers [EMBL: FM178379, FM178380, FM178381,
FM178382, FM178383 and FM178384].
Comparison of the genome sequences was facilitated by
using the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) [77], which
enabled the visualization of BLASTN and TBLASTX comparisons [69] between the genomes. Orthologous proteins were identified as reciprocal best matches using
FASTA with subsequent manual curation. Pseudogenes
had one or more mutations that would prevent correct
translation and each of the inactivating mutations were
subsequently checked against the original sequencing
data.
In order to determine if duplicated genes originated from
the plasmids or from the chromosomes and to predict the
order in which the plasmids were acquired we performed
a CAI and a CBI analysis: CAI and a CBI analysis: CAI used
the Highly expressed genes (encoding all ribosomal pro-

teins and tRNA synthetases in the genome) as the reference; CBI used the codon usage of all the genes in the
genome and measured the adaptation of each gene to
that. The CAI was done via EMBOSS cai and the CBI was
done via EMBOSS codcmp [27].
Amplification of genes from other isolates was performed
by PCR using Platinum Pfx DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) according to the protocol supplied by the
manufacturer. PCR amplification products were analyzed
in 0.8% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide.
Isolates of A. salmonicida, A. wodanis and V. splendidus were
grown in LB medium containing 2.5% NaCl, diluted in A.
salmonicida minimal medium (Vsmm [100 mM KH2PO4,
15 mM (NH4)2SO4, 3.9 μM FeSO4, 2.5% NaCl, 0.81 mM
MgSO4, 2 mM Valin, 0.5 mM Isoleucin, 0.5 mM Cystein,
0.5 mM Methionin, 40 mM Glutamate]) and transferred
to Vsmm agar supplemented with 10 mg/ml α-chitin
(Sigma-Aldrich) or N-acetyl-α-D-glucosamine (Calbiochem). Plates were incubated from 2 to 7 days at 12°C (A.
salmonicida and A. wodanis) and 22°C (V. splendidus) and
growth evaluated by visual examination.
