Abstract
Background: Tunicates represent a key metazoan group as the sister-group of vertebrates within
chordates. The six complete mitochondrial genomes available so far for tunicates have revealed
distinctive features. Extensive gene rearrangements and particularly high evolutionary rates have
been evidenced with regard to other chordates. This peculiar evolutionary dynamics has hampered
the reconstruction of tunicate phylogenetic relationships within chordates based on mitogenomic
data.
Results: In order to further understand the atypical evolutionary dynamics of the mitochondrial
genome of tunicates, we determined the complete sequence of the solitary ascidian Herdmania
momus. This genome from a stolidobranch ascidian presents the typical tunicate gene content with
13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs and 24 tRNAs which are all encoded on the same strand.
However, it also presents a novel gene arrangement, highlighting the extreme plasticity of gene
order observed in tunicate mitochondrial genomes. Probabilistic phylogenetic inferences were
conducted on the concatenation of the 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes from
representatives of major metazoan phyla. We show that whereas standard homogeneous amino
acid models support an artefactual sister position of tunicates relative to all other bilaterians, the
CAT and CAT+BP site- and time-heterogeneous mixture models place tunicates as the sistergroup of vertebrates within monophyletic chordates. Moreover, the reference phylogeny indicates
that tunicate mitochondrial genomes have experienced a drastic acceleration in their evolutionary
rate that equally affects protein-coding and ribosomal-RNA genes.

Conclusion: This is the first mitogenomic study supporting the new chordate phylogeny revealed
by recent phylogenomic analyses. It illustrates the beneficial effects of an increased taxon sampling
coupled with the use of more realistic amino acid substitution models for the reconstruction of
animal phylogeny.

Background
Mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs) of bilaterian animals
are short, circular DNA molecules of 14-16 kb in length,
typically characterized by the absence of introns and the
presence of only short intergenic regions, with the exception of the control region (CR), a non-coding region
assumed to contain the elements for the regulation of replication and transcription of the genome [1,2]. To date,
about 1,700 complete metazoan mitochondrial genomes
have been sequenced and used in comparative mitogenomics and phylogenetic studies on different taxonomic
scales [3-9].
The mitochondrial gene content is highly conserved
across the different bilaterian phyla, with typically 37
genes [1,2,10]. Among them, 13 genes encode for proteins
[ATP synthase subunits 6 and 8 (atp6 and atp8), cytochrome oxidase subunits (cox1, cox2, cox3), apocytochrome b (cytb), and dehydrogenase subunits (nd1, nd2,
nd3, nd4, nd5, nd6 and nd4L)]. The remaining genes
encode two ribosomal subunits (srRNA and lrRNA) and
usually 22 tRNAs. However, cases of duplication and loss
of tRNAs have been reported within bilaterians [11,12].
Tunicate mitochondrial genomes illustrate such exceptions and typically encode 24 tRNAs, apart from two Phallusia species which lack the tRNA-Asp [13], and
Halocynthia roretzi which encode two tRNA-phe [14]. The
two additional tRNAs present in tunicate mitochondrial
genomes when compared to vertebrates are (i) the tRNAGly (for AGR codons), which is necessary for the translation due to the derived tunicate mitochondrial genetic
code [15], and (ii) the tRNA-Met (for AUA codon), whose
presence might reduce the conflict between translation
initiation -- which requires a tRNA-Met (for AUG) -- and
translation elongation that involves AUG codons [16].
The mitochondrial gene order is highly conserved within
Deuterostomia [10,17], and particularly in chordate
genomes. Conversely, mitochondrial gene arrangement
shows an important plasticity in some animal phyla, (e.g.
molluscs and nematodes [1,2]), and especially in tunicates [2,13,18-22]. Tunicates, or Urochordates, are marine
deuterostomes characterized by markedly diversified
developmental and life history traits, and traditionally
encompass three major classes: Ascidiacea (sea squirts),
Thaliacea (salps) and Appendicularia (larvaceans). Ascidiacea, commonly referred to as ascidians, is the most speciose and widespread group. Several ascidian species have
been identified as invasive species, such as Styela clava and

Pyura praeputialis [23-26], and have a strong ecological
impact on the invaded marine ecosystems. Some species
are also widely used as model organisms in evo-devo studies like Ciona intestinalis and Botryllus schlosseri [27-31].
According to the traditional classification, the class Ascidiacea is subdivided into three major orders: Phlebobranchia, Aplousobranchia, and Stolidobranchia. In
contrast with this taxonomic view, 18S rRNA-based phylogenies have shown that ascidians are in fact paraphyletic
[32-34]. According to the 18S rRNA phylogenetic framework, Aplousobranchia, Phlebobranchia, and Thaliacea
are closely related, whereas Stolidobranchia forms a distinct and monophyletic group, which might be close to
Appendicularia, although the position of the latter is still
debated [32,33].
To date, complete mitochondrial genomes of tunicates are
mainly available for a single representative of Thaliacea
(Doliolum nationalis) and five ascidians [13,18-22], including four phlebobranchians (Ciona intestinalis type A and B,
C. savignyi, Phallusia fumigata, P. mammillata) and one stolidobranchian (Halocynthia roretzi). The available mitochondrial data suggest that several unique features
characterize mitogenomic evolution in tunicates relative
to other chordate phyla. Two main peculiarities can be
distinguished. The first refers to the highly variable gene
order observed within the group, which implies that
extensive gene rearrangements have occurred even at low
taxonomic levels [13,18,19]. However, since most available tunicate complete mtDNA sequences belong to phylogenetically-related species (except H. roretzi) according to
the 18S rRNA reference [32-34], it is not possible to evaluate whether mitochondrial gene rearrangements characterize the whole order or only the Aplousobranchia +
Phlebobranchia + Thaliacea clade. The second specificity
is that of an accelerated evolutionary rate of tunicates, as
revealed by the long branches of the group in mitogenomic topologies [35-37] and the associated composition
bias [37]. However, whether this accelerated substitution
rate is restricted to protein coding genes as in snakes [38]
or is a more general feature of the whole mtDNA of Tunicates, has yet to be investigated.
These two peculiar evolutionary features of tunicate mitochondrial genome evolution have hampered their reliable
phylogenetic placement within metazoans. Analyses of
mitochondrial protein-coding genes have almost always
systematically placed tunicates outside Bilateria
[20,35,36,39]. This is in sharp contrast with recent

nuclear-based phylogenomic studies that identified tunicates as the closest living relatives of vertebrates within
chordates [40-43]. Only two recent mitogenomic study
have found marginal support for chordate monophyly.
Bourlat et al. [37] grouped cephalochordates with vertebrates according to the traditional Euchordata hypothesis
using a concatenation of the 13 protein coding genes
under a site- and time-heterogeneous mixture model in
Bayesian phylogenetic reconstructions. Alternatively,
Zhong et al. [39] recovered the new chordate phylogeny
under the maximum likelihood framework when removing the fastest evolving vertebrates species and when considering only the four most conserved mitochondrial
proteins.
Here, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome
of the solitary ascidian Herdmania momus (Ascidiacea: Stolidobranchia: Pyuridae), an Indo-Pacific species that was
introduced into the Mediterranean Sea via the Suez Canal
[44]. We describe the structural and compositional features of H. momus mtDNA, discuss its evolutionary
dynamics with respect to other tunicate and chordate
mitochondrial genomes, and provide an updated metazoan phylogeny based on probabilistic analyses of the 13
mitochondrial proteins using site- and time-heterogeneous mixture models of amino acid substitutions.

Results and Discussion
General features of H. momus mtDNA
The mitochondrial genome of H. momus (Figure 1)
accounts for 15,816 base pairs (bp) in length which falls
within the typical range of other tunicate genomes; the
smallest genome being 14,579 bp long in P. fumigata and
the largest one 16,351 bp in D. nationalis. It presents the
typical tunicate gene content with all 13 protein-coding
genes of the mitochondrial respiratory apparatus, including atp8, which appears so divergent in Tunicates that it
had been difficult to annotate in the initial assemblies of
C. savignyi and H. roretzi [18,21,22]. It also encodes for the
two mitochondrial ribosomal genes, srRNA and lrRNA,
and a total of 24 tRNAs (Figure 2), among which are two
distinct tRNAs for the Gly (AGR and GGN), Leu (UUR and
CUN), and Ser (AGY and UCN) codons (Figure 2), which
is consistent with the modified mitochondrial genetic
code of tunicates. Finally, H. momus mtDNA contains an
additional tRNA-Met (AUA), similar to all other tunicate
genomes sequenced so far [13,18-22].

In contrast to other deuterostome mtDNA genomes, all
genes are encoded on the same DNA strand and thus
mitochondrial gene transcription shows only one orientation in H. momus, as in all other tunicate genomes
sequenced to date. In chordates, although the majority of
genes is co-orientated on one major DNA strand (Hstrand), a minimum set of tRNAs and the nd6 gene are
encoded from the minor one (L-strand) [2,17,45]. The

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/534

genome architecture of H. momus thus provides additional evidence in support of the hypothesis that gene
arrangement in only one strand is a shared derived feature
of tunicate mtDNAs [2].
With regard to genome organization, H. momus mtDNA
seems substantially less compact than other available
tunicate mitochondrial genomes. Adjacent genes overlap
in four cases: cox1 - tRNA-Val (9 bp), nd4L - tRNA-Leu (15
bp), atp8 - tRNA-Asp (1 bp) and nd2 - tRNA-Trp (2 bp).
The total gene overlap thus appears slightly lower with
respect to the average ~35 bp gene overlap of the other
tunicate genomes [13]. Interestingly, there is no proteinprotein gene overlap. Furthermore, H. momus shows a
high percentage of non-coding (NC) sequence (ca. 10%).
Concerning base composition, the mitochondrial
genome of H. momus is AT rich with a value of 63.5%. The
overall base frequencies as estimated in the coding strand
follow the decreasing order T, G, A and C. T is by far the
most abundant nucleotide with 41.3% in the genome.
Most tunicate mtDNAs present similar compositional ATrich profiles varying from 61.1% in D. nationalis to 78.6%
in C. intestinalis. The only exception concerns the mitochondrial genomes of species from the genus Phallusia,
which present more balanced AT and GC compositions
with 52.8% and 53.2% AT in P. mammillata and P. fumigata, respectively [13].
Protein-coding genes
The predicted protein-coding genes in the mtDNA of H.
momus present lengths that are overall similar to their
orthologues in the other tunicate genomes. Nevertheless,
H. momus was not predicted to carry any deletion at the Cterminal ends of nd4 and nd5 genes similar to those
reported in H. roretzi [21].

The base composition of protein-coding genes in H.
momus was measured as being A+T rich, as is the profile of
its entire genome. Consequently, the codon usage follows
the same pattern, with C-rich codons showing lower frequencies than those that are T- or G- rich. Extreme cases
are constituted by the CGC codon for Arginine, which is
never used, and by the UUU codon for Phenylalanine and
UUG codon for Leucine, which are the most frequently
used. The CGC codon is also never used in the two Ciona
genomes, whereas it is present in other tunicate genomes
[18,22].
The preferred start and stop codons in H. momus mitochondrial genes are GTG (6 genes) and TAG (7 genes),
respectively. In the other Pyuridae (H. roretzi), GTG is the
preferred start codon too, but TAA is the most frequent
stop codon (8 genes). Like in other tunicate genomes,
incomplete T-starting stop codons are predicted at the end
of the three genes coding for nd1, nd4 and nd4L. The comPage 3 of 16

plete TAA stop codon is probably created by polyadenylation.
rRNA genes
Because of high sequence divergence of tunicate rRNA
sequences, the boundaries of all tunicate mitochondrial
rRNA sequenced so far have been inferred from the flank-

ing genes. Likewise, the srRNA gene in H. momus is estimated at most as 673 bp long, thus being slightly shorter
than its acidian orthologues which range from 687 to 738
bp, and about 30 bp longer than the srRNA of D. nationalis
mtDNA. On the genome map, it is found located between
the tRNA-Ala and tRNA-Glu. The lrRNA, on the other
hand, appears to be at most 1,159 bp long, a length simiPage 4 of 16

lar to that of other tunicates, and is located downstream
of tRNA-Tyr and upstream of cytb (Figure 1).
Both lengths and locations of the two rRNA genes in the
H. momus mitochondrial genome provide additional evidence for two unique features of mtDNA evolution in
tunicates. The first is that tunicates present the shortest
mitochondrial rRNA genes among chordates, and more
generally among deuterostomes, with lengths varying at
most from 641 to 738 bp for the small ribosomal subunit
and from 1,059 to 1,279 bp for the large ribosomal subunit [13]. The corresponding lengths for the srRNA and
lrRNA genes in the other chordate lineages are estimated
as higher than 844 bp and 1,367 bp, respectively. The second feature shared by all tunicates concerns the location
of the two genes in the mitochondrial genome. In contrast
to all other chordates, where the two rRNA coding genes
are usually adjacent, srRNA and lrRNA are found rearranged and separated in all available tunicate mtDNAs
[2]. The distance between the two genes in H. momus
genome is about 5 kb. Distances of the same order of magnitude (5-7 kb) were also identified in the mtDNAs of
Cnidaria, some Protostomia, and some Echinodermata
[2].
tRNA genes
The predicted cloverleaf structures for the 24 tRNA genes
of the H. momus mitochondrial genome are presented in
Figure 2. As in H. roretzi, only two tRNAs are characterized
by an unusual structure: tRNA-Ser (AGY) and tRNA-Asn.
tRNA-Ser (AGY) appears to possess an 8 bp-long anticodon stem structure. Similar long stems (7-9 bp) have been
reported in Ciona ssp., D. nationalis, and H. roretzi tRNASer (AGY) [18,20-22]. However, this structure is absent in
Phallusia tRNA-Ser (AGY), which appears to have retained
the classical cloverleaf conformation [13]. Concerning the
tRNA-Asn gene, two alternative cloverleaf structures have
been inferred, as also previously reported for H. roretzi
[21]. The structure predicted by tRNA-scan (Figure 2) is
characterized by a two-nucleotide spacer between the

DHU and the anti-codon stem as well as a mismatch at the
start of the T stem. The alternative conventional cloverleaf
structure (Figure 2) appears less stable, in forming a mismatch at the start of the D arm. Similar two-nucleotide
spacers have also been found in the tRNA-Asn structures
of Phallusia ssp., H. roretzi, and D. nationalis, but not in
Ciona ssp [13,18,20-22].
Non-coding regions
Table 1 summarizes some attributes of the non-coding
(NC) regions in H. momus and the other available tunicate
mitochondrial genomes. In total, 28 NC regions have
been identified in H. momus mtDNA, with a total size of
1,457 bp (9.21% of the total genome). When compared
to other ascidians, the proportion of NC regions in H.
momus appears higher, with previous estimates varying
from 1.94 to 5.89%, in the mtDNAs of P. mammillata and
P. fumigata, respectively. The proportion of NC sequences
in the closely-related H. roretzi is three-fold lower (3.09%)
than that of H. momus, yet the total number of NC fragments is almost identical in both species, and the two
genomes differ by ca. 1 kb in length. Among tunicates,
only Doliolium nationalis has more non-coding regions
with 13.1% of the total genome length (Table 1).

Considering length distributions, 19 of the 28 NC regions
present lengths over 20 bp, with the longest accounting
for 197 bp and being located between the nd6 and tRNATyr genes (Figure 1). Three additional NC regions measuring more than 100 bp have been identified in H. momus
mtDNA, involving the disjunction of the following gene
pairs: cytb - nd2, nd4 - tRNA-His, and tRNA-Lys - nd3. The
remaining nine NC sequences are shorter intergenic spacers, mostly 3-10 bp long, distributed homogenously
through the genome.
The presence of palindrome sequences was checked by
sequence similarity searches and has been detected within
12 NC regions, and in particular within the three longest
NC regions of the H. momus mitochondrial genome.

However, no stem-loop structure similar to that of the
control region of vertebrate mt-genomes has been identified in H. momus. Further studies are necessary to establish
whether these regions are involved in the control of replication and transcription.
Sequence similarities searches have finally revealed the
occurrence of a duplication event in the NC regions of the
H. momus genome, similar to those previously determined
in Ciona intestinalis and Phallusia fumigata mtDNAs [13].
Here, a fragment of 89 bp was found duplicated in two
different locations of the genome: the first, situated in the
non-coding region downstream of the nd6 gene and
upstream of the gene encoding for the tRNA-Tyr (NC =
197 bp); while the second involved the non-coding region
downstream of the tRNA-Asn (NC = 88 bp) and 13 bp of
the 5' region of the tRNA-Lys. The estimated distance
between the repeated motifs is about 5 kb (Figure 1).
Gene order
The mtDNA of H. momus shows a novel gene arrangement
with respect to other tunicates, and is radically different
from that of its close relative Halocynthia roretzi (Figure 3).
Surprisingly, only one block containing two consecutive
genes is conserved between the two species: the pair tRNA-

Trp - tRNA-Ile. When considering only the relative
arrangement of protein-coding genes, an additional block
appears to be shared by the two members of Stolidobranchia, consisting of the three genes cytb - nd2 - nd5. In
H. roretzi, cytb and nd2 are separated by four tRNA-coding
genes, whereas in H. momus the two genes are separated by
a long non-coding region of 157 bp. Likewise, the number
of tRNA genes separating nd2 and nd5 as well as their
identities differ in each genome (two and five tRNAs separate these two genes in H. momus and H. roretzi respectively). Conversely, the pair cox2- cytb, previously
considered as unique and shared by all other tunicates is
absent in H. momus, as well as the pair tRNA-Arg - tRNAGln which is conserved in most tunicate genomes[13,1822].
Thus, the mitochondrial genome organization in H.
momus when compared to that of H. roretzi suggests that
extensive gene rearrangements occur within Stolidobranchia, similar to those observed in Phlebobranchia
[13]. Future work should determine whether co-generic
species in Stolidobranchia also present high variations in
gene order, as reported for the genera Ciona and Phallusia
within Phlebobranchia [2].

Phylogenetic analyses
The mitochondrial genome has been repeatedly used in
molecular phylogenetics of animals, principally due to
several convenient features, such as its relatively small
size, its cellular abundance, and its mostly uniparental
mode of inheritance facilitating orthology assignment [5].
However, the phylogenetic resolving power of mtDNAs is
often reduced by pervasive lineage-specific variations of
base composition and substitution rate [46,47]. Bilaterian
evolutionary relationships obtained from previous phylogenetic reconstructions based on mitochondrial genes
[35,36] are in relatively good agreement with the currently
accepted view of Protostomia phylogeny [48]. However,
the situation is more complex concerning Deuterostomia,
mainly because of the recurrent placement of tunicates as
sister-group of either the remaining Bilateria [35,36] or
the other chordates [37]. Such placement outside chordates is in direct contradiction to results from recent largescale phylogenomic studies, which strongly support the
clade Olfactores, i.e., the grouping of tunicates with craniates (jawed vertebrates + cyclostomes) to the exclusion of
cephalochordates [40-43]. The sister position of tunicates
relative to the remaining Bilateria is generally interpreted
as a long-branch attraction artifact caused by the peculiarities of tunicate mitogenomic evolution in terms of both
lineage-specific evolutionary rate and amino-acid composition [36,37,39].

In our mitogenomic dataset, the potential occurrence of
compositional biases was explored through a Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) of amino acid composition
of the 54 taxa (Figure 4). This statistical analysis shows
that tunicates have a markedly heterogeneous amino acid
composition that is clearly distinct from most other sampled taxa. Moreover, tunicates appear extremely divergent
from the other chordate representatives. Tunicates and
jawed-vertebrates are located at the extreme opposite sides
of the graph, with cephalochordates in an intermediate
position. There is thus a strong compositional heterogeneity in our amino-acid dataset that might cause phylogenetic artefacts if it is not specifically accounted for in
models of sequence evolution.
The maximum likelihood tree obtained on the 13 proteincoding genes concatenation using the site- and timehomogeneous mtREV+Γ4 model of amino-acid sequence
evolution places tunicates as the sister group of the
remaining Bilateria, as previously reported [35,36,39].
However, the bootstrap support for such a position is low
(BP = 61). This result is presumably the outcome of two
types of systematic biases: compositional heterogeneity of
the tunicate lineage compared to other chordate and animal phyla (see Figure 4) combined with accelerated evolutionary rates [37,39]. ML phylogenetic analyses were
also conducted under an empirical site-heterogeneous

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/534

CAT mixture model [49] which has been shown to alleviate long-branch attraction artefacts in the context of animal phylogenomics [50]. The ML tree inferred under this
model shows a dramatic topological shift in placing tunicates as the sister-group of craniates within monophyletic
chordates and deuterostomes, in agreement with phylogenomic studies [35,41]. However, this phylogenetic placement is not statistically supported (BP < 50).
In order to further explore the effect of model misspecification on mitogenomics tree inference, Bayesian analyses
have been conducted using a range of amino-acid
sequence evolution models (Table 2). There is a clear distinction between the results obtained using site-homogeneous models (mtREV+Γ4 and GTR+Γ4) on the one side,
and variants of the CAT+Γ4 site-heterogeneous model [51]
and the site- and time-heterogeneous CAT+BP+Γ4 model
[52], on the other side. Site-homogeneous models moderately support a sister-group relationship between tunicates and Xenoturbella (PP ≥ 0.83), whereas the different
CAT mixture models support the grouping of tunicates
with craniates (i.e., monophyly of Olfactores) with the
highest Bayesian posterior probabilities obtained using
the most complex and better-fitting models (PP ≥ 0.94).
These results exemplify the impact of the model of
sequence evolution on mitogenomic inference of phylogeny by showing that the new chordate phylogeny
[35,40,41] can be corroborated by using a model that
accounts for both compositional and evolutionary rate
heterogeneities.
The Bayesian consensus tree obtained under the site- and
time-heterogeneous CAT+BP+Γ4 model is detailed in Figure 5. The overall phylogenetic picture is consistent with
the common tripartite structure of Bilateria phylogeny
[53], with Protostomia and Deuterostomia, and Protostomia being further divided into Lophotrochozoa and
Ecdysozoa. Strong statistical support is obtained for the
monophyly of Protostomia (PP = 1), and for both of its
two major lineages Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa (PP ≥
0.99). The monophyly of Deuterostomia is less strongly
supported however (PP = 0.89), in agreement with recent
mitogenomic [37] and phylogenomic results [41,54].
Within Deuterostomia, Echinodermata and Hemichordata were both retrieved as firmly monophyletic (PP = 1)
and are strongly grouped into Ambulacraria, as suggested
by early mitogenomic studies [55] and later confirmed by
phylogenomics [35,41,43]. However, the position of
Xenoturbella within Deuterostomia remains unresolved in
our analysis (PP < 0.5) as also found in the latest mitogenomic analysis [37], whereas phylogenomics support its
sister-group relationship with Ambulacraria into a clade
named Xenambulacraria [35,41]. Strong statistical support is obtained for the respective monophyly of the three
chordate groups: Cephalochordata (PP = 1), Tunicata (PP

= 1), and Craniata (PP = 0.99). The monophyly of Chordata is strongly supported (PP = 0.96) for the first time in
a mitogenomic study, as is the monophyly of Olfactores
(PP = 0.94). These results are fully congruent with the
growing body of evidence coming from phylogenomic
studies that revealed the unexpected sister-group relationship between tunicates and craniates [35,39,40,42,43].
Although removal of fast-evolving gene and taxa has been
found to recover the new chordate phylogeny, such an
approach is not successful to solve relationships within
Tunicata [39]. Our mitogenomic analysis provided strong
evidence for intra-tunicate relationships, with the overall
phylogenetic scheme being well resolved despite the high
lineage-specific evolutionary rate (Figure 5). The inferred
relationships for the group were notably in concordance
with nuclear-based phylogenies and morphological data.
More precisely, Herdmania was unambiguously retrieved

in a sister-group relationship with Halocynthia (PP = 1), in
agreement with the systematic classification that places
these two ascidian genera within the stolidobranch family
Pyuridae [33]. Firm evidence was similarly obtained for
the respective grouping of the congeneric species of Ciona
and Phallusia (PP = 1), and high posterior probability is
retrieved for a sister-group relationship of the two genera
into Phlebobranchia (PP = 1). Finally, the thaliacean Doliolum is found to branch within ascidians with solid statistical support (PP = 0.99), favoring the hypothesis of
Ascidiacea paraphyly [20] as also supported by 18S rRNA
phylogenies [32,34,56].

comparison of branch lengths obtained on the proteinand rRNA-coding mitochondrial partitions, first demonstrates that tunicates are clearly the fastest evolving species
of the metazoan dataset on both partitions (Figure 6). It
also shows that the rRNA-coding partition evolves on
average about three times more slowly than the proteincoding gene partition (TBL ratio = 34.79/11.76 = 2.96).
However, in contrast to what has been observed in snake
mitochondrial genomes [38,57], there is very good correlation between root-to-tip distances inferred from the two
partitions (R2 = 0.88). These results reveal that tunicate
mitochondrial genomes have experienced a drastic acceleration of evolutionary rate that affects both protein-coding genes and ribosomal-RNA genes. This latter
observation seems therefore to exclude the occurrence of
adaptive evolution episodes in protein-coding genes,
recently reported for snake and agamid lizard mitochondrial genomes [58], as the ultimate cause behind the elevated substitution rates in tunicate mitochondrial
genomes. Nevertheless, the lineage-specific rate acceleration of tunicates probably explains the difficulties previously encountered in reconstructing their phylogenetic
position based on mitogenomic data.

Conclusion
The complete mitochondrial genome of the ascidian H.
momus shares several features with the other tunicate mtDNAs so far sequenced: (i) all genes are encoded on the
same strand; (ii) two additional tRNAs, when compared
with vertebrates, are present (one for Gly, one for Met);
(iii) the gene order is highly rearranged, and differs from
all other known tunicates, with the noticeable synteny dis-

ruption of the cox2--cytb gene block; and (iv) the evolutionary rate is elevated and involves both protein- and
rRNA-coding genes. From the phylogenetic viewpoint, the
analysis of the concatenated mitochondrial proteins
recovers the tunicates + craniates clade within monophyletic chordates, provided that site- and time-heterogeneous mixture models of amino acid replacements are
used.

Methods
Sampling and DNA extraction
The H. momus (Savigny, 1816) individual used for our
study was collected in June 2006 on the Eilat-Ashkelon
pipeline pier in Eilat, Red Sea 29°31' N 34°55' E at a
depth of 12 m [44]. Genomic DNA was isolated from
gonads by placing ~0.5 cm3 of tissue in 1 ml of lysis buffer
(100 mM Tric-HCl pH = 7.8; 100 mM EDTA; 0.5% SDS;
0.2 mg/ml proteinase K) overnight at 55°C. The digestion
was followed by Phenol:Chloroform:Isoamyl alcohol
extraction (25:24:1) and isopropanol precipitation [59].
DNA sequencing and gene annotation
Primers were designed to match conserved regions of
chordate genomes in the cox1, cox2, cox3, and cytb genes
(Table S1 in Additional File 1). PCR amplifications were
performed using the ExTaq polymerase (TaKaRa) in 25 μL
reaction mixture according to manufacturer's instructions
and were conducted in two steps. A first amplification was
performed with external primers followed by a re-amplification of the initial PCR product using different sets of
internal primers. Based on the partial sequences obtained
for the aforementioned genes, longer specific primers

Root-to-tip distances (protein-coding genes)

Figure 6
Comparison of lineage-specific evolutionary rates
Comparison of lineage-specific evolutionary rates. The graph is a plot of the 54 root-to-tip distances calculated from
branch lengths estimated under the GTR+Γ8 model on the reference topology (see Figure 5) for the concatenations of rRNAcoding (y-axis) and protein-coding (x-axis) mitochondrial genes. Symbols corresponding to non-bilaterian outgroups (green
squares), tunicates (red triangles), and all other bilaterians (blue diamonds) are indicated. The phylograms showing the branch
lengths inferred from each dataset are presented with the highly evolving tunicates figured in red. The linear regression dotted
line is figured with its associated equation and correlation coefficient. The y = x line is also indicated to underline the difference
in average evolutionary rate between the rRNA and protein mitochondrial partitions.

tigs were assembled using both ARACHNE [60] and Chromaspro (Technilysium Pty. Ltd.) programs. Regions of
low coverage in the assembly (i.e., fewer than three
clones) were confirmed by primer-walking sequencing
(~4 kb of the genome was re-sequenced) with the use of
specific primers and genomic DNA as template. The complete mtDNA sequence of H. momus was deposited under
the EMBL accession number FN296153.

Protein coding genes were identified using the ORFFinder tool of NCBI [61] and the DOGMA server [62]. Following Iannelli et al. [13], boundaries of protein coding
gene were inferred in such a way that overlap between
genes was minimized and similarity between tunicate proteins was maximized. ATG and non-standard initiation
codons [63] were considered as reliable start codons.

Both the tRNAscan-SE 1.23 program and the DOGMA
server were used to identify and infer the secondary structures of tRNA genes [64]. tRNAs that were not identified
by the above tools were sought by folding all putative
non-coding regions using the Mfold server [65]. All predicted cloverleaf secondary structures were manually
checked and compared with other known ascidian tRNAs.
The positions of the small (srRNA) and large (lrRNA)
ribosomal RNA genes were identified by the DOGMA
server and confirmed based on sequence similarity
searches to orthologous genes in other ascidians. Finally,
the boundaries of the rRNA genes were inferred from the
flanking genes.
Dataset assembly
The phylogenetic dataset was built upon the taxon sampling used by Bourlat et al. [35]. We expanded the tunicate
sampling to seven by including the newly-sequenced H.
momus and two recently published genomes from the
genus Phallusia [13]. The snake representative (Boa constrictor) was excluded because snake mitochondrial
genomes have been shown to be the subject of adaptive
evolution that can severely bias phylogenetic inference
[58]. The final dataset therefore comprises 54 taxa including 31 deuterostomes, 19 protostomes, and four non-bilaterian outgroups (cf. Additional file 1). The nucleotide
sequences of all mitochondrial genes were retrieved from
the Organellar Genome Retrieval (OGRe) database [66].
For the 13 protein coding genes, sequences were translated, and aligned at the amino-acid level using MAFFT
with default parameters [67]. Ambiguously aligned sites
were identified and removed from all individual genes
separately, using the program Gblocks [68] with the following parameters: minimum number of sequences for a
conserved position = 18; minimum number of sequences
for a flanking position = 29; maximum number of contiguous nonconserved positions = 8; minimum length of a
block = 2; allowed gap positions = with half. The concatenation of the 13 proteins yielded a phylogenetic dataset
including 54 taxa and 2136 unambiguously aligned
amino-acid sites, of which 1697 were variable (Additional
file 2).
Phylogenetic analyses
Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using Maximum
Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Inference (BI) reconstruction approaches on the concatenated amino acid dataset.
Maximum Likelihood (ML) analyses were performed
using the program PHYML 3 [69] under the models
mtREV+Γ4 and CAT+Γ4, with a 4-category Gamma (Γ4)
distribution of the among-site amino acid replacement
rate heterogeneity [70], and with the number of CAT categories set to 20 (C20) as recommended by Le et al. [49].
The heuristic ML searches were conducted by performing
Subtree Pruning and Regrafting (SPR) moves on a Neigh-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/534

bor-Joining (NJ) starting tree. Statistical support was estimated by Bootstrap resampling with 100 pseudoreplicates generated by the program SeqBoot of the
PHYLIP package [71]. In all replicates, ML analyses were
performed using PHYML through the same heuristic
search strategy. Nodal bootstrap supports (BS) were
obtained from the 50% majority rule consensus of the
100 reconstructed trees using the program TREEFINDER
[72].
Bayesian inference was conducted using the program PhyloBayes 3.1 [73] under both homogeneous amino acid
models (mtREV+Γ4 and GTR+Γ4) and variants of the siteheterogeneous CAT+Γ4 mixture model (CAT+Poisson+Γ4,
CAT+mtREV+Γ4, and CAT+GTR+Γ4) [51]. The program
nhPhyloBayes [74] was used to performed Bayesian analysis under a site- and time-heterogeneous model which
combines the break-point approach (BP) in order to
model variations of amino acid replacement rates along
branches and the CAT mixture model in order to account
for site-wise variations of these rates. In this CAT+BP+Γ4
analysis, the number of categories of the mixture component was fixed at 60 (C60), and the biochemical profiles
were those inferred by Le et al. [49], rather than being estimated.
In Bayesian analyses under mtREV+Γ4, GTR+Γ4, and
under the different variants of CAT+Γ4 (CAT+Poisson+Γ4,
CAT+mtREV+Γ4, and CAT+GTR+Γ4), three independent
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) were run in parallel,
whereas five MCMC were run for analyses under
CAT+BP+Γ4. Each MCMC was launched from a random
initialization and for a large number of cycles with parameters and trees saved every cycle. Priors were set to values
as described in Blanquart and Lartillot [52] concerning
the CAT+BP model, and in Lartillot et al. [73] concerning
all other applied models. Convergence of MCMC was
checked by monitoring the marginal likelihood through
cycles. Bayesian Posterior Probabilities (PP) were
obtained from the trees sampled during the stationary
phase of the different MCMC.
Branch length analysis
Two concatenated nucleotide datasets were constructed to
compare evolutionary rates of protein-coding and rRNAcoding mitochondrial genes. In both cases, the different
genes were individually aligned using MAFFT, and ambiguously aligned sites were removed using Gblocks before
building each concatenation. This led to a 13 protein-coding gene dataset containing 8,130 nucleotide sites and a
rRNA dataset including 806 sites (Additional files 3 and
4). Using the rooted topology obtained from the analysis
of the amino-acid sequences under the CAT+BP+Γ4 mixture model as a reference, ML branch lengths were optimized under the GTR+Γ8 model using PAUP* 4.0b10 [75]

on both the protein-coding and rRNA-coding nucleotide
concatenations. For each dataset, the root-to-tip distance
was calculated for each of the 54 taxa by summing the
branch lengths on the path going from the root of the tree
to each of its terminals. The two sets of root-to-tip distances were then compared graphically to evaluate the lineage-specific rate correlation between the two
mitochondrial partitions.
