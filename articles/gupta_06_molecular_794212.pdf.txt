Abstract
Background: The epsilon proteobacteria, which include many important human pathogens, are
presently recognized solely on the basis of their branching in rRNA trees. No unique molecular or
biochemical characteristics specific for this group are known.
Results: Comparative analyses of proteins in the genomes of Wolinella succinogenes DSM 1740 and
Campylobacter jejuni RM1221 against all available sequences have identified a large number of
proteins that are unique to various epsilon proteobacteria (Campylobacterales), but whose
homologs are not detected in other organisms. Of these proteins, 49 are uniquely found in nearly
all sequenced epsilon-proteobacteria (viz. Helicobacter pylori (26695 and J99), H. hepaticus, C. jejuni
(NCTC 11168, RM1221, HB93-13, 84-25, CF93-6, 260.94, 11168 and 81-176), C. lari, C. coli, C.
upsaliensis, C. fetus, W. succinogenes DSM 1740 and Thiomicrospira denitrificans ATCC 33889), 11 are
unique for the Wolinella and Helicobacter species (i.e. Helicobacteraceae family) and many others are
specific for either some or all of the species within the Campylobacter genus. The primary sequences
of many of these proteins are highly conserved and provide novel resources for diagnostics and
therapeutics. We also report four conserved indels (i.e. inserts or deletions) in widely distributed
proteins (viz. B subunit of exinuclease ABC, phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase, RNA polymerase β 'subunit and FtsH protein) that are specific for either all epsilon proteobacteria or different
subgroups. In addition, a rare genetic event that caused fusion of the genes for the largest subunits
of RNA polymerase (rpoB and rpoC) in Wolinella and Helicobacter is also described. The interrelationships amongst Campylobacterales as deduced from these molecular signatures are in
accordance with the phylogenetic trees based on the 16S rRNA and concatenated sequences for
nine conserved proteins.
Conclusion: These molecular signatures provide novel tools for identifying and circumscribing
species from the Campylobacterales order and its subgroups in molecular terms. Although sequence
information for these signatures is presently limited to Campylobacterales species, it is likely that
many of them will also be found in other epsilon proteobacteria. Functional studies on these
proteins and conserved indels should reveal novel biochemical or physiological characteristics that
are unique to these groups of epsilon proteobacteria.

Background
The epsilon (ε-) proteobacteria comprise one of the five
Classes within the phylum Proteobacteria [1-4]. These
bacteria inhabit a wide variety of ecological niches ranging from gastrointestinal tracts of animals to water reservoirs, sewage, oil-field community and deep-sea
hydrothermal vents [2,5-10]. Recent studies show that εproteobacteria comprise a significant proportion of the
microbial population in deep-sea hydrothermal vents
where, because of their ability to carry out different types
of metabolism using a variety of alternate electron donors
(e.g. H2, formate, elemental sulfur, sulfide, thiosulfate)
and acceptors (e.g. sulfite, elemental sulfur, nitrate), they
play important role in carbon, nitrogen and sulfur cycles
[7,9-13]. A great deal of interest in these bacteria stems
from the fact that many of these species are host-associated (Helicobacter, Campylobacter, Wolinella) and comprise
important human and animal pathogens [14-16]. Of
these bacteria, Helicobacter pylori is the causative agent for
gastric and peptic ulcers [17,18] and infections with this
and the related species H. hepaticus are important predisposing factors in gastric cancers in humans and liver cancers in rodents [16,19,20]. Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli
are the most common causes of food-born illnesses such
as diarrhea worldwide [15,21]. C. jejuni infection can also
lead to the neuromuscular disease Guillain-Barre syndrome [15,21,22], which causes weakness and paralysis of
muscles. In contrast to the pathogenic nature of Helicobacter and Campylobacter, Wolinella succinogenes is a commensal in the gastrointestinal tract of cattle and it is not
known to cause any illness in either animals or humans
[2,5,14,23]. In addition to the host-associated species,
many free-living members which include chemolithotrophic and autotrophic bacteria (e.g., Thiomicrospira denitrificans, Arcobacter, Caminibacter, Nautilia, Thiovulum)
also form part of the ε-proteobacterial group
[4,6,8,10,12,24].
The ε-proteobacteria are presently distinguished from
other bacteria based their branching in the 16S rRNA trees
[2,4-6]. Although most of these bacteria assume a spiral
shape sometime during their life cycle [5,25] and they can
also utilize a variety of electron donors and acceptors
(noted above), these characteristics are not unique to this
group [2,4-6,10]. Presently, there is no molecular or biochemical characteristic known that is unique to this group
of bacteria. Within ε-proteobacteria, two main orders,
Campylobacterales and Nautiliales, are presently recognized
[8,10,12,24] The Campylobacterales is made up of three
families, Campylobacteraceae, Helicobacteraceae and Hydrogenimonaceae, whereas the Nautiliales order is comprised
of three genera (Nautilia, Lebetimonas and Caminibacter)
[8,10,12,24]. Except for the 16S rRNA, very little sequence
information is available for species belonging to the
Hydrogenimonaceae family and the Nautiliales order.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/167

In the past few years, genomic sequences of several ε-proteobacterial species from the Campylobacterales order have
become available. The completely sequenced genomes
include those from: Helicobacter pylori 26695 [26], H.
pylori J99[27], H. hepaticus ATCC 51449 [28], Campylobacter jejuni NCTC 11168 [29], C. jejuni RM1221
[30],Wolinella succinogenes DSM 1740 [23] and Thiomicrospira denitrificans ATCC 33889 [31]. In addition, genomes
of several Campylobacter species (viz. C. lari, C. coli, C.
upsaliensis and C. fetus) and C. jejuni subsp. jejuni strains
(viz.HB93-13, 84-25, CF93-6, 260.94, 11168 and 81-176)
are now at assembly stage[30] and sequence information
from them is available in the NCBI database. The availability of these sequences has opened new windows for discovering novel molecular characteristics that are unique to
these bacteria and can be used for their diagnostics as well
as for biochemical and functional studies. Earlier comparative genomic studies on ε-proteobacteria have examined
a number of aspects of their gene/protein contents
[14,23,26-30,32-34]. Of these, the studies by Eppinger et
al. [14] and Fouts et al. [30] are particularly detailed. In
these works, genes/proteins that are unique to individual
genomes were identified as well as genes that are commonly shared by, but not uniquely present, in a number
of these bacteria (viz. H. pylori, H. hepaticus, C, jejuni and
W. succinogenes). Pair-wise comparison of the gene contents of these bacteria, functional classification of their
genomic inventory, synteny and co-linearity of genes in
various genomes, and examples of gene losses as well as
recombination were also reported [14,30]. Additionally,
Coenye and Vandamme [35] have carried out studies to
identify genes that have been laterally transferred between
ε-proteobacteria and other bacteria. However, thus far no
comparative study has examined or identified genes/proteins that are uniquely found in ε-proteobacteria at different taxonomic levels. Such genes and proteins, because of
their specificity, provide novel means for diagnostics and
taxonomic studies [36-39] and for discovering important
physiological characteristics that are unique to these bacteria.
In our recent work, we have used comparative genomics
to identify a large number of signature proteins that are
specific for either alpha proteobacteria [40], chlamydiae
[38] or Actinobacteria [39]. In the present work, we have
carried out systematic BLAST searches on all open reading
frames (ORF) in the genome of Wolinella succinogenes
DSM 1740 and Campylobacter jejuni RM1221 to identify
whole genes/proteins (i.e. signature proteins) that are
unique to ε-proteobacteria. These studies have led to identification of 49 genes/proteins that are uniquely present in
various sequenced ε-proteobacteria (including Thiomicrospira), as well as many other proteins that are limited to
certain subgroups within the Campylobacterales order.
Additionally, we also describe a number of conserved

indels in widely distributed proteins that are specific for
either all-available ε-proteobacteria or for certain subgroups among them. The identified signature proteins
and indels comprise rare genetic changes that have been
introduced at various stages during the evolution of
Campylobacterales (ε-proteobacteria) and their species distribution patterns are supported by the branching order of
these species in phylogenetic trees.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/167

which could be due to selective gene loss [33]. Of these 8
proteins, WS1211, WS1752 and WS2059 are present in
almost all sequenced ε-proteobacteria except T. denitrificans. The phylogenetic position of T. denitrificans within εproteobacteria is presently not clear (discussed later).
Hence, absence of these proteins in T. denitrificans could
be explained by either earlier divergence of this species in
comparison to other sequenced ε-proteobacteria, or due
to gene loss.

Results and discussion
These studies were undertaken to identify molecular characteristics that are uniquely shared by either all sequenced
ε-proteobacteria species, or their subgroups, but which
generally are not found in any other organism. Three different kinds of molecular signatures that are specific for εproteobacteria are described in the present work. The first
of these consists of whole proteins or open reading frames
(ORFs) that are uniquely found in ε-proteobacteria. The
other two characteristics are comprised of rare genetic
changes (RGCs) consisting of either conserved inserts or
deletions (indels) in widely distributed proteins that are
specific for the ε-proteobacterial homologs as well as a
gene-fusion event within this group of bacteria. A brief
description of these molecular signatures and their evolutionary significances are discussed below.
Whole proteins or ORFs that are unique for the epsilonproteobacteria (Campylobacterales order) and
Helicobacteraceae family
The ε-proteobacteria-specific proteins were identified as
described in the Methods section. Generally, a protein was
considered to be epsilon-proteobacteria specific if all significant alignments (or hits) in a PSI-BLAST search with
the query protein were from ε-proteobacteria species. In a
few cases, where the E values of 1 or 2 hits from other species also exhibited borderline significance, but there was a
large increase in E value from the last ε-proteobacteria hit
in the search to these other proteins, such proteins were
also regarded as ε-proteobacteria-specific. In Table 1, I list
some characteristics of 53 proteins that could be regarded
as specific for most sequenced ε-proteobacteria based on
these criteria. Forty-one of these 53 proteins were present
in all sequenced ε-proteobacteria genomes and for them
all significant alignments/hits were from this group. However, in three instances (viz. WS0216, WS0260 and
WS1495) the E value for one ε-proteobacteria was just
above the default threshold value (.005) for significance.
For three other proteins, WS0316, WS1874 and WS2146,
1–3 hits from other bacteria exhibited borderline significance, but there was a large jump in E values from the last
ε-proteobacteria hit to these other proteins (see Table 1),
indicating that these proteins are also ε-proteobacteriaspecific. Eight other proteins in this Table (WS0865,
WS1211, WS1235, WS1329, WS1640, WS1752, WS1771
and WS2059) are missing in 1–2 ε-proteobacteria species,

For the protein WS0230 listed in Table 1, in addition to
various ε-proteobacteria, homologs with very low E values
(e-90 range) were also found in two δ-proteobacteria
belonging to the Desulfovibrio genus. In phylogenetic trees
based on 16S rRNA [2,41], various proteins [42,43], and
in analyses based on conserved indels [44], δ-proteobacteria generally branch in close proximity to the ε-proteobacteria. Hence, the shared presence of the WS0230
homologs in Desulfovibrio genus and ε-proteobacteria may
reflect either a deep phylogenetic relationship that exist
between these two groups [43-45], or it could result from
lateral gene transfer [46]. Based on the available data we
are unable to distinguish between these possibilities.
However, it is interesting to note that a 1 aa insert in a conserved region of the RecA protein, which was previously
indicated to be specific for ε-proteobacteria [44], and is
present in all available ε-proteobacteria homologs, is also
commonly present in Desulfovibrio and Lawsonia species
(belonging to Desulfovibrionaceae family) (results not
shown).
Table 1 also lists the available information regarding possible cellular functions of these proteins. Most of these
proteins are of unknown functions. However, in a
number of cases weak but significant similarity is
observed to conserved domains found in other proteins in
the databases [47], or to particular COG families [48]. The
information of this kind, along with the genomic context
of these ORFs, provide useful leads for exploring the cellular functions of these conserved hypothetical proteins
[49-52]. Of the proteins that are found in all sequenced εproteobacteria, WS0266 and WS0802 were experimentally identified as plasminogen binding proteins [53]. It
has been suggested that these proteins may enable these
bacteria to coat their exterior surface with plasminogen
and thus they could be involved in enhancing their virulence. The putative functions of several other proteins are
indicated in Table 1 and they include a putative helicase
(WS0086), a Cbb3 type cytochrome oxidase (WS0180), a
protein related to the FixH family (WS0185) of Rhizobium,
a protein WS0316 containing the RDD domain, two proteins (WS0476 and WS0480) which contain
molybdopterin_binding (MopB) domain found in
NADH oxidoreductase I. Also found were two proteins
implicated in flagellar function (WS0490 and WS0575)

The species distribution of these proteins was determined by BLASTp and PSI-BLAST searches as described in the Methods section. Unless
otherwise indicated all of these proteins are uniquely found in the following sequenced genomes: H. pylori 26695, H. pylori J99, H. hepaticus ATCC
51449, C. jejuni (various strains: NCTC 11168, RM1221, HB93-13, 84-25, CF93-6, 260.94, 11168 and 81-176), C. lari, C. coli, C. upsaliensis, C. fetus, W.
succinogenes DSM 1740 and Thiomicrospira denitrificans ATCC 33889.

[23], a protein (WS0520) with TonB domain and another
protein (WS1874) containing a domain related to the
DNA polymerase delta subunit, a protein (WS2146)
showing some similarity to Sua5 domain involved in
binding to double stranded DNA, and a protein WS0230
showing similarity to deacylase domain. In addition, several proteins are predicted to be either periplasmic or
membrane proteins. It should be emphasized that most of
these functional predictions or annotations are based on
weak similarity to conserved domains (CD) as identified
by the CD search program implemented with the BLAST
program [47]. Although this information is very useful,
the actual functions of most of these proteins, which
exhibit very little similarity to other molecules in the database, remain to be determined. Among the proteins listed
in Table 1 that are missing in some ε-proteobacteria,
WS1211 is a homolog of the C. jejuni invasion antigen
(CiaB), which is recognized as an important factor in its
pathogenicity[14,54]. Of the proteins listed in Table 1, 10
proteins (WS133-WS134, WS184-WS185, WS447WS448, WS1039-WS1040 and WS1495-WS1496) are
present in clusters of two in the genome, and they could
be involved in related functions [51,52].

across various ε-proteobacteria species. A partial nucleotide sequence alignment for the WS0086 coding sequence
for various ε-proteobacterial species is shown in Figure 1.
A large number of positions in the alignments are completely conserved in various Campylobacterales species and
there are several long stretches (boxed) showing a high
degree of sequence conservation. The PCR primers and
other molecular probes based on these conserved regions
could provide novel and specific means for identification
of both new, as well existing Campylobacterales species and
possibly different ε-proteobacteria.

Several of the proteins listed in Table 1 (e.g., WS0086 and
WS2123) exhibit a high degree of sequence conservation

Our analysis also reveals that 99 proteins in the genome
of W. succinogenes DSM 1740 show no significant similar-

The comparative analysis of W. succinogenes genome has
also identified 11 proteins that are uniquely found in
Wolinella and Helicobacter species (Table 2). Of these 11
proteins, the first 7 are present in all 4 of the sequenced
species/strains from these genera, whereas the last 4 proteins are only found in W. succinogenes and H. hepaticus
but missing in the two H. pylori strains. All of these proteins are of unknown function. The Wolinella and Helicobacter genera are part of the Helicobacteraceae family and
these uniquely shared proteins provide potential molecular markers for this family.

Figurenucleotide sequence alignment for an ε-proteobacterial specific protein WS0086

Partial nucleotide sequence alignment for an ε-proteobacterial specific protein WS0086. The initial part of this alignment, which

ity to any other protein in the databases [see Additional
file 1]. Barr et al. [23] have previously indicated a much
higher number (i.e. 490) of such proteins. However, since
their analysis, genomes of several ε-proteobacteria as well
as numerous other organisms have become available
[28,30,31,55]. Because of this, and our employment of
more stringent criteria for identification of group-specific
proteins, the number of such proteins is considerably
smaller than indicated originally [23]. Sixteen of these
proteins are present in seven clusters (WS0261-WS0262;

Proteins specific for the Campylobacter genus
We have also performed BLAST searches on various proteins found in the genome of C. jejuni RM1221 to identify
proteins that are unique to the Campylobacter species.
Fouts et al. [30], who sequenced the genomes of several
Campylobacter species/strains had reported comparative

Homologs showing significant similarities to these proteins are only detected in the sequenced Wolinella and Helicobacter genomes (W. succinogenes

paper), but they did not look for proteins that were
uniquely shared by either all or different Campylobacter
species. Our analyses have identified 15 proteins (Table 3)
that are uniquely present in all of the sequenced Campylobacter species viz. C. fetus, C. lari, C. upsaliensis, C. coli and
C. jejuni (NCTC 11168, RM1221, HB93-13, 84-25, CF936, 260.94, 11168 and 81-176). Three additional proteins
listed in Table 3, CJE0368, CJE1499 and CJE1574 are
missing in only one of the Campylobacter species, which is
likely due to gene loss. Eighteen other proteins (Table 4)
are present in all of the Campylobacter species, except C.
fetus. Among the sequenced Campylobacter species, C. fetus
exhibits deepest branching in various phylogenetic trees
(see next section). Hence, the absence of these proteins in
C. fetus could be explained by their introduction in a common ancestor of the other Campylobacter species after
branching of C. fetus. Ten other proteins (Table 5) are
commonly present in C. upsaliensis, C. coli and C. jejuni
only indicating a closer relationship among these species.
The genes for these proteins were likely introduced or
evolved in a common ancestor of these three species. Likewise, 28 other proteins listed in Table 6, which are only
found in C. coli and C. jejuni (different strains) points to a
specific relationship between these species to the exclusion of all others. Most of these proteins are of unknown
function. However, in a few cases, where any similarity to
conserved domain present in other proteins has been
identified by BLAST searches, such information is noted in
various Tables.
These analyses have also identified a large number of proteins that are specific for the C. jejuni species (Table 7).
The first 5 proteins listed in this table are present in all
sequenced C. jejuni strains (NCTC 11168, RM1221,
HB93-13, 84-25, CF93-6, 260.94, 11168 and 81-176),
whereas the remainder are missing or have been lost from
a few of the strains.

Conserved indels and other rare genetic changes specific
for epsilon proteobacteria
Conserved indels in protein sequences provide another
useful kind of molecular signatures for taxonomic and
diagnostic studies. In our recent work, conserved indels
that are distinctive characteristics of many different
groups of bacteria (e.g., Chlamydiae, Proteobacteria,
alpha proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Deinococcus-Thermus, Aquificae, etc.) have been identified
[44,56-60]. To identify conserved indels that may be specific for ε-proteobacteria, the sequence alignments of various proteins constructed in earlier work were examined.
These studies have led to identification of 4 conserved
indels that are specific for this group. The characteristics of
these indels and of the proteins in which they are found
are briefly described below.

In Figure 2, I present sequence information for two conserved indels that are uniquely present in various
sequenced ε-proteobacterial homologs, but which are not
found in the corresponding proteins from any other
organism. The first of these indels is a 3 aa insert in the B
protein of the Uvr ABC system (Fig. 2A), which plays a key
role in the nucleotide excision repair process [61]. The second indel consists of a 2 aa deletion in the enzyme phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (Fig. 2B), which is required for
protein synthesis. Both these proteins are widely distributed in bacteria and sequence information for only representative species from other bacteria is presented. The
indels in both these proteins are flanked by highly conserved regions and the unique presence of these indels in
all available ε-proteobacteria homologs strongly indicate
that they are distinctive molecular characteristics of these
bacteria. Two additional conserved indels that are specific
for only certain ε-proteobacteria are shown in Figure 3.
The top panel in this Figure shows a 1 aa insert in the FtsH
protease that is uniquely present in all sequenced ε-pro-

teobacteria or other organism. This insert was likely introduced in a common ancestor of the Campylobacter after
branching of C. fetus.
In addition to these conserved indels, Zakaharova et al.
[62] have identified a rare genetic event that causes fusion
of two different genes within certain groups of ε-proteobacteria. The two largest and highly conserved subunits of
RNA polymerase (RpoB and RpoC, each approximately
1400 aa) are encoded by two distinct genes in various bacteria [62]. However, a rare genetic event has led to the
fusion of these genes in Helicobacter and Wolinella species,
such that RpoB and RpoC are now made as a single large
polypeptide (≈ 2900 aa) (Fig. 4). In contrast, in Campylobacter and T. denitrificans, similar to other bacteria, separate genes encode for these proteins. This rare genetic
event provides evidence of a specific relationship between
Helicobacter and Wolinella species, which are part of the
Helicobacteraceae family.
Evolutionary significance of the signature proteins and
conserved indels
It is important to understand at what point during the
evolution of ε-proteobacteria, the above-described molecular characteristics evolved or were introduced. To determine their evolutionary significance, phylogenetic trees
were constructed for the sequenced ε-proteobacteria spe-

cies based on 16S rRNA and a concatenated dataset of
sequences for 9 highly conserved proteins (viz. RpoB,
RpoC, Hsp70, Hsp60, elongation factor (EF)-Tu, EF-G,
Gyrase A, Gyrase B and alanyl-tRNA synthetase). In the
16S rRNA tree, the ε-proteobacterial species under consideration formed two clades (Fig. 5A). One clade consisted
of various Campylobacter species whereas the other clade
included Helicobacter, Wolinella and T. denitrificans. In the
latter clade, T. denitrificans formed a deep branching outgroup of the Helicobacter and Wolinella species, but a specific association of T. denitrificans to these species was not
supported by the bootstrap score of the node (<50%) (Fig.
5A) [8,12]. In contrast to the rRNA tree, in the tree based
on concatenated protein sequences, all of the internal
nodes were reliably resolved. In this tree, T. denitrificans
formed a deep branching lineage showing no specific relationship to either the Helicobacter/Wolinella clade or to the
Campylobacter species (Fig. 5B). A similar deep branching
of T. denitrificans in comparison to other sequenced ε-proteobacteria is observed in phylogenetic trees based on
Hsp70, RpoC, Gyrase A, Gyrase B and EF-Tu protein
sequences (results not shown).
Using the above trees as reference points, the evolutionary
stages where different ε-proteobacteria-specific genes/proteins or other molecular signatures likely evolved is
depicted in Fig. 5C. The genes for the first 49 proteins

as a single large polypeptide.

denitrificans but present in all (or most) other ε-proteobacteria were likely introduced in a common ancestor of the
Helicobacter, Wolinella and Campylobacter after the divergence of T. denitrificans. The insert in the FtsH protease
was also likely introduced at this stage. The proteins listed
in Table 2 were introduced in a common ancestor of the
Wolinella and Helicobacter genera, and it is expected that
some of them will constitute distinctive characteristics of
the Helicobacteraceae family. The rare genetic event leading
to the fusion of rpoB and rpoC genes also occurred at a similar stage. The proteins listed in Tables 3 to 7 that are
unique to either all sequenced Campylobacter species or
various species within this genus, were introduced at different stages in the evolution of this group (Fig. 5C). The
observed species distribution patterns of these proteins
strongly support the branching pattern of Campylobacter
species in the phylogenetic trees (Figs. 5A and 5B). The
inference from these proteins and the phylogenetic trees
that C. fetus is one of the deepest branching species within
the Campylobacter genus is also strongly supported by the
large insert in RpoC (Fig. 3B), which is present in all
Campylobacter species except C. fetus.

Conclusion

The comparative genomics of ε-proteobacteria reported
here have led to identification of a large number of molecular signatures (e.g., whole proteins, conserved indels and
a gene-fusion event) that are distinctive characteristics of
these bacteria. Our analyses indicate that these characteristics have been introduced at various stages in the evolution of ε-proteobacteria, but once introduced, they were
generally stably retained in various descendents of these
lineages with minimal gene loss or lateral gene transfer to
other bacteria. Sequence information for these proteins or
molecular signatures is presently available only from the
Campylobacterales species and no information is available

from the Nautiliales order, which comprise the other main
group within ε-proteobacteria. However, the genomes of
several ε-proteobacteria (e.g. Nautilia, Caminibacter, Arcobacter, Sulfurovum, Nitratiruptor) covering all of its main
groups are currently in progress (noted in ref. [10]). Based
upon our work on signature sequences for other groups of
bacteria [56-59], we expect that many of the signatures
identified in the present work (Table 1) will also be found
in different ε-proteobacteria, whereas several other will
prove to be specific for only the Campylobacterales order.
The primary sequences of many of these genes/proteins
are highly conserved and they provide novel diagnostic
tools for these bacteria by means of PCR amplification
and fluorescence in situ hybridization methods. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies based upon these proteins provide another means for their detection.
Additionally, these Campylobacterales or ε-proteobacteria
specific proteins also provide potential targets for developing therapeutics and vaccines that are specific for these
bacteria. The identified signature proteins and RGCs also
provide novel and definitive molecular means for circumscribing a number of taxonomic groups within Campylobacterales (ε-proteobacteria) and for identifying species
belonging to these groups.
The cellular functions of most of the ε-proteobacteria-specific proteins are not known. Although a number of these
proteins exhibit weak sequence similarity to conserved
domains in other proteins, their actual functions may be
quite different, and determining them constitute an
important task for the future. Likewise, it is also of much
interest to understand the functional significance of the
conserved indels in various proteins (viz. RpoC, PheRS,
FtsH, exinuclease B) that are specific for different taxonomic groups/clades of ε-proteobacteria. Since these
indels, which are located in highly conserved regions, are

highly likely that they are functionally important (and
essential) for these bacteria. Thus, it is of much impor-

tance to understand how the functions of these proteins
are modified by these indels and the physiological significance of these modifications for these bacteria. Further

studies on these ε-proteobacteria specific proteins and
indels thus may lead to the discovery of novel biochemical and physiological characteristics that are uniquely
shared by these bacteria.

Methods
Identification of proteins that are specific for epsilon
proteobacteria
To identify proteins that are specific for ε-proteobacteria,
all proteins in the genomes of W. succinogenes DSM 1740
[23] were analyzed. This genome was chosen for a
number of reasons. First, of the sequenced ε-proteobacteria genomes, W. succinogenes genome is among the largest
(2.11 Mb) with 2043 ORFs [23]. Hence, one expects that
minimal gene loss has occurred in this bacterium and that
it should contain maximal number of genes that may be
present in other ε-proteobacteria. Second, phylogenetic
and comparative studies have indicated that W. succinogenes forms an outgroup to various Helicobacter species
and thus lies in an intermediate position between members of the Helicobacteraceae and Campylobacteraceae families [6,14]. Thus, BLAST searches on proteins from this
genome should enable us to identify proteins that are
unique to the Helicobacteraceae family as well as those
shared with other taxonomic groups of ε-proteobacteria.
To identify proteins that are specific for the Campylobacter
species, the genome of C. jejuni RM1221 was analyzed.
The BLASTp searches were initially performed on each
individual protein or ORF in these genomes against all
available sequences in the NCBI sequence database, to
identify all related gene/protein in other organisms
[63,64]. These searches were performed using the default
parameters as set by the BLAST program, except that the
low complexity filter was turned off. The expected values
(E-values) of different hits from these searches were
inspected to identify putative ε-proteobacteria-specific
proteins [38,40]. The proteins that were of interest to us
generally involved large increase in E-values from the last
ε-proteobacteria hit in the blast search to the first hit from
any other organism. Further, the E values of these latter
hits were expected to be in a range higher than 10-4, which
indicates weak level of similarity that could occur by
chance. However, higher E-values are sometimes acceptable for smaller proteins as the magnitude of the E-value
depends upon the length of the query sequence [63]. All
promising proteins identified by the above criteria were
further analyzed using the position-specific iterated (PSI)
BLAST program [63]. This program creates a position-specific scoring matrix from statistically significant alignments produced by the BLASTp program and then
searches the database using this matrix. The PSI-BLAST
program is more sensitive in identifying weak but biologically relevant sequence similarity as compared to the
BLASTp program [63]. The output of the PSI-BLAST program divides the various hits into two categories, i.e.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/167

sequences producing significant alignment versus those
where the E values are worse than the threshold (default
value set at .005). For most of the proteins that are indicated to be specific for different subgroups within ε-proteobacteria, all significant alignments were from the
indicated groups. In a few cases, where an isolated hit has
an E value slightly below the threshold value (arbitrarily
set), but there was a large jump in E value from the last εproteobacteria hit, such proteins were also regarded as
specific for the indicated groups. All of the identified
group-specific proteins were also examined for the presence of any conserved domain [47] and this information
along with the genome identification number of the protein, its accession number, sequence length, etc. was tabulated. In the description of various proteins in the text, the
"WS" and "CJE" parts of the descriptors indicate the identification numbers of the proteins in the genomes of W.
succinogenes DMS 1740 and C. jejuni RM1221, respectively.
Identification of conserved indels that are specific for
epsilon proteobacteria
Multiple sequence alignments for large number of proteins have been created in our earlier work [44,56,60]. To
search for conserved indels that might be specific for εproteobacteria, these alignments were visually inspected
to identify any indel that was uniquely present in ε-proteobacteria species, and which was flanked by conserved
sequences. The indels that were not flanked by conserved
regions were not considered. The specificity of these
indels for ε-proteobacteria was evaluated by carrying out
detailed BLAST searches on short sequence segments (usually between 60–100 aa) containing the indel and the
flanking conserved regions. The purpose of these BLAST
searches was to obtain sequence information from all
available bacteria homologs to determine the presence of
the identified indels in various species. The sequence
information for these indels was compiled into signature
files such as those presented in Figures 2 and 3.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic trees for the sequenced ε-proteobacteria species were constructed based on 16S rRNA sequences as
well as a number of conserved proteins (viz. RNA
polymerase β subunit (RpoB), RNA polymerase β ' subunit (RpoC), DNA gyrase A subunit (GyrA), DNA gyrase B
subunit (GyrB), Hsp70, Hsp60, alanyl tRNA synthetase
(AlaRS), elongation factor-G (EF-G) and elongation factor-Tu (EF-Tu) proteins) The 16S rRNA and protein
sequences were downloaded from the Ribosomal Database Project-II site [65] and NCBI databases, respectively

was constructed by the Juke's and Cantor [67] method.
The sequences for various proteins were concatenated into

a large dataset containing 7919 aligned positions (RpoB
(1440), RpoC (1559), GyrA (880), GyrB (814), Hsp70
(661), Hsp60 (552), AlaRS (912), EF-G (698) and EF-Tu
(403)) and a neighbor-joining bootstrap tree based on
this was constructed by Kimura's methods [68]. All gaps in
the sequences were omitted during phylogenetic analyses.
The trees were constructed using the PHYLIP [69] and the
TREECON programs [70] and they were rooted using the
chlamydiae species which is a deep branching group in
comparison to ε-proteobacteria [41-43,45].
