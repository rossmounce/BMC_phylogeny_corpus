Characterization of phylogenetic networks with
NetTest
Software

Miguel Arenas*1, Mateus Patricio1, David Posada1 and Gabriel Valiente2

Abstract
Background: Typical evolutionary events like recombination, hybridization or gene transfer make necessary the use of
phylogenetic networks to properly depict the evolution of DNA and protein sequences. Although several theoretical
classes have been proposed to characterize these networks, they make stringent assumptions that will likely not be
met by the evolutionary process. We have recently shown that the complexity of simulated networks is a function of
the population recombination rate, and that at moderate and large recombination rates the resulting networks cannot
be categorized. However, we do not know whether these results extend to networks estimated from real data.
Results: We introduce a web server for the categorization of explicit phylogenetic networks, including the most
relevant theoretical classes developed so far. Using this tool, we analyzed statistical parsimony phylogenetic networks
estimated from ~5,000 DNA alignments, obtained from the NCBI PopSet and Polymorphix databases. The level of
characterization was correlated to nucleotide diversity, and a high proportion of the networks derived from these data
sets could be formally characterized.
Conclusions: We have developed a public web server, NetTest (freely available from the software section at http://
darwin.uvigo.es), to formally characterize the complexity of phylogenetic networks. Using NetTest we found that most
statistical parsimony networks estimated with the program TCS could be assigned to a known network class. The level
of network characterization was correlated to nucleotide diversity and dependent upon the intra/interspecific levels,
although no significant differences were detected among genes. More research on the properties of phylogenetic
networks is clearly needed.
Background
The evolution of DNA or protein sequences that have
been the subject of reticulating events like recombination, gene transfer, or hybridization cannot be depicted
with a single phylogenetic tree [1-3]. On the contrary,
phylogenetic networks allow reticulations among
branches rather than imposing a strictly bifurcating
structure, and therefore are much more suitable for this
task [4-6]. There are different types of phylogenetic networks [5]. Among these, split networks (implicit representation) are obtained as a combinatorial generalization
of phylogenetic trees, and are designed to represent
incompatibilities within and between data sets. In order

to be able to accommodate incompatible splits, they contain internal nodes that do not represent ancestral genes
or sequences. On the other hand, reticulate networks
(explicit representation) represent evolutionary histories
in the presence of reticulate events such as hybridization,
horizontal gene transfer, or recombination, and every
internal node represents an inferred ancestor. Most often,
phylogenetic networks estimated from real data are
depicted as unrooted, especially at the intraspecific level.
Research on phylogenetic networks is just starting,
especially if we compare it with all the work that has been
done on bifurcating trees, which, indeed, are much simpler structures. This means that many of the calculations
that can be easily implemented for bifurcating trees are
not available for phylogenetic networks. For example,
typically researchers are interested in contrasting different biological hypotheses through the comparison of

alternative evolutionary histories. In the absence of reticulation a variety of appropriate metrics exist to measure
the distance between two phylogenetic trees (see [7-10]),
but in the case of networks this issue is much more complicated.
"Perfect" -that is, that obey non-negativity, separation,
symmetry, and triangle inequality-comparison metrics
for networks have already been proposed [11-18],
together with recognition algorithms that allow for the
classification of networks into specific categories. Indeed,
the formal characterization of phylogenetic networks is
important if we want to compare reticulate hypotheses
within a sound framework. For example, a web server
http://dmi.uib.es/~gcardona/BioInfo/alignment.php was
recently developed by G. Cardona to compare and align
explicit phylogenetic networks based on the μ-distance
metric [19]. The problem is that from the evolutionary
point of view, these categories imply stringent assumptions. We have shown that population genetic models like
the coalescent with recombination can result into
uncharacterizable phylogenetic networks [20]. However,
it is unknown whether this is also the case for networks
estimated from real data.

Implementation
Implementation of the NetTest server

The NetTest web server is composed of an HTML frontpage in which the user can upload or paste the network in
different formats (see Results). The analysis pipeline was
developed in Perl using CGI (Common Gateway Interface). The network classification uses the BioPerl module
Bio::PhyloNetwork [13]. The web server uses the Apache
HTTP server and was tested and verified using Firefox,
Safari, and Internet Explorer.
Characterization of Reticulate Networks from Empirical
Data

We used NetTest to analyze a large group of nucleotide
alignments from the PopSet database at the NCBI http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=popset (Figure 1).
We downloaded all available data sets for four genes: POL
(viral polymerase), COX1 (mitochondrial cytochrome
oxidase I), 18S ribosomal RNA (small eukaryotic ribosomal subunit), and ITS1 (ribosomal internal transcribed
spacer). In total, we analyzed 565, 1407, 2294, and 191
data sets, respectively, each containing between 9 and 50
sequences. All data sets were aligned using MAFFT [24].

Definitions

A network contains nodes (vertices) and branches (edges)
connecting them. Here we will refer to rooted networks
(rooted directed acyclic graphs) with a temporal reference that allows for the identification of parent and child
(descendant) nodes. Internal nodes have one or two children while external nodes (leaves) have none. The oldest
node is called the root and has no parents. Tree nodes and
hybrid nodes have one and two parents, respectively.
Internal tree nodes have two children, while hybrid nodes
have only one child. Nodes that share the same parent are
siblings. Networks can be classified as tree sibling [12,13],
where every hybrid node has at least one sibling that is a
tree node; tree child [11,13,14], in which every internal
node has at least one child that is a tree node; galled-trees
[15,16,21], where the paths from the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the parents of a hybrid node
down to the hybrid node form disjoint cycles; and
(binary) trees, which only contain tree nodes. These network classes are nested: tree-sibling ? tree-child ? galledtrees ? trees, meaning a tree is also a galled-tree, a treechild network, and a tree-sibling network, and so on.
Networks that cannot be included in any of these categories are considered uncharacterizable. There is also a
nested classification of networks as level-k networks [22],
where a level-0 network is a tree, a level-1 network is a
galled-tree, and, in general, a network is a level-k network
if every biconnected component has at most k hybrid
nodes. Perfect metrics have also been proposed for levelk networks [23].

For each gene, the table indicates the total number of data sets studied (both databases), the total number of networks generated by TCS,
the total number and mean (per network) of reticulate nodes and the number of networks classified as tree, galled-tree, tree-child, and treesibling. In parenthesis we indicate the number of networks in that category that did not belong to the previous category and the percentage
of characterized networks. In brackets we indicated the number and mean (per network) of reticulate nodes. The last row indicates the
number of uncharacterizable networks (i.e., more complex than tree-sibling).

In addition, we also gathered 516 alignments from the
Polymorphix database [25], representing a variety of
nuclear genes from Homo sapiens. This database uses
ClustalW [26] to generate the alignments.
All the alignments were fed into the TCS program [27]
for the estimation of statistical parsimony networks [28]
under the default 95% connectivity limit, which is the
maximum number of mutational connections between
pairs of sequences justified by the "parsimony" criterion
[28]. Note that the presence of divergent sequences can
result in the generation of several TCS (sub)networks, in
which case were analyzed independently. In a few cases
(<1%) the program crashed before completing the analysis, and the corresponding data sets were excluded from
the analyses. The resulting networks were rooted accord-

ing to the node with the highest outgroup weight (i.e., the
rooting probabilities described in [29]).

Results
NetTest: A web server for the characterization of explicit
networks

We have developed a web server called NetTest, available
from the software section at http://darwin.uvigo.es, able
to classify phylogenetic networks into several formal categories (tree, galled-tree, tree-child, and tree-sibling). As
far as we know, no other similar programs or servers
implement this analysis. All the submitted networks have
to be rooted (directed), but they can be specified in different formats:

composition.

• Directed GML: The Graph Modelling Language is
the standard file format in the Graphlet graph editor
system (see http://www.infosun.fim.uni-passau.de/
Graphlet/GML/).
• TCS-GML: The program TCS [27] can generate
unrooted networks in GML format (saved as *.graph
files). In this case, the network is automatically
directed by NetTest assuming that the "root" is the
node with the highest outgroup weight. If the file submitted to the server contains several networks, NetTest analyzes them in a sequential fashion.
• NEXUS-SplitsTree: The program SplitsTree [30] can
produce rooted networks using the "rooted equal
angle algorithm" that can be exported in NEXUS format (*.nex) and feeded directly to NetTest.
• Extended Newick (eNewick) [19]: This is the type of
representation used for the directed networks simulated with Netgen [31] or estimated with Phylonet

diversity. Error bars indicate 95% confidence intervals.

[32]. The leftmost occurrence of each hybrid node in
an eNewick string corresponds to the full description
of the subnetwork rooted at that node.
• DIMACS standard [33]: This is a widely used format
for representing graphs, developed for the DIMACS
Challenge
http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Challenges/.
NetTest will consider that all edges are directed and
that the first node of each edge is the parent node.
• Branch list: A simple list of connections node x to
node y, where x corresponds to the parent node and y
to the descendant node.
The main output of NetTest is a depiction of the network and an indication of whether it can be characterized
under the tree, galled-tree, tree-child, and tree-sibling
categories. The results of the analysis can also be downloaded. NetTest also implements a feedback for questions, requests, and bug reports, and a help page is
included with detailed information.
Network classes resulting from empirical data

Using NetTest we found that most networks (98.5-99.6%)
could be characterized regardless of the gene analyzed
(Table 1). The analysis of the human data sets also
resulted in a high number of characterizable networks
(Table 1). For PopSet data sets, those networks containing
a majority of sequences corresponding to the same species (intraspecific data sets) resulted in a significantly
higher percentage (χ2 P-value < 2.2e-16) of characterization for any class assignment (especially for tree, galledtree, and tree-child) than networks derived from data sets
where several sequences belonged to more than one species (interspecific data sets) (see also Figure 2). Also, the
level of characterization depended on nucleotide diversity (ANOVA P-value < 2 × 10-16). In particular, data sets
resulting in trees were significantly less diverse than data
sets resulting in more complex networks (Figure 3).

Discussion and Conclusions
NetTest is able to analyze rooted phylogenetic networks
in several formats and assign them to different network
classes -those for which perfect metrics exist. The application is useful not only for theoretical studies, for example in the design of new metrics, but also for measuring
the complexity of the evolutionary processes in real or
simulated data sets.
Using NetTest we have shown that most of the TCS
networks resulting from the analysis of real data can be
classified as tree-sibling, tree-child, or galled-tree networks. Indeed, this result is dependent on the fact that
TCS was designed for the analysis of closely related
sequences. The TCS connection limit forces complex
networks to break apart into simpler ones, therefore
favouring their assignment to known network categories.
This also explains why the TCS networks are simpler than

Arenas et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:268

the ancestral recombination graphs simulated with the
coalescent [20].
Appropriate metrics exist for the comparison of empirical characterizable networks (see for example [13]) like
those produced by TCS, allowing us to contrast reticulate
hypotheses in a formal fashion. Only a small fraction of
the TCS networks estimated here were more convoluted
than any of these classes, suggesting that more research is
needed if we want to compare and analyze more complex
phylogenetic networks estimated from real data.
