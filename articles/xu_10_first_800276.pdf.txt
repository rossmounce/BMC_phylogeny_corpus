Abstract
Background: Chemokines, a group of small and structurally related proteins, mediate chemotaxis of various cell types
via chemokine receptors. In mammals, seven different CXC chemokine receptors denoted as CXCR1 to CXCR7 have
been reported. However, the chemokine receptor CXCR5 has not been reported in other vertebrates.
Results: In the present study, the genomic sequence of CXCR5 was isolated from the grass carp Ctenopharyngodon
idella. The cDNA sequence of grass carp CXCR5 (gcCXCR5) consists of 1518 bp with a 43 bp 5' untranslated region (UTR)
and a 332 bp 3' UTR, with an open reading frame of 1143 bp encoding 381 amino acids which are predicted to have
seven transmembrane helices. The characteristic residues (DRYLAIVHA) and conserved cysteine residues are located in
the extracellular regions and in the third to seventh transmembrane domains. The deduced amino acid sequence
shows 37.6-66.6% identities with CXCR5 of mammals, avian and other fish species. The grass carp gene consists of two
exons, with one intervening intron, spaced over 2081 bp of genomic sequence. Phylogenetic analysis clearly
demonstrated that the gcCXCR5 is clustered with those in other teleost fish and then in chicken and mammals. Realtime PCR analysis showed that gcCXCR5 was expressed in all tested organs/tissues and its expression level was the
highest in trunk kidney, followed by in the spleen. The expression of gcCXCR5 was significantly modulated by
immunostimulants such as peptidoglycan (PGN), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid sodium salt
(Poly I:C) and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA).
Conclusion: The cDNA and genomic sequences of CXCR5 have been successfully characterized in a teleost fish, the
grass carp. The CXCR5 has in general a constitutive expression in organs/tissues examined, whereas its expression was
significantly up-regulated in immune organs and down-regulated in brain, indicating its potential role in immune
response and central nervous system.
Background
Chemokines are a family of small (8-14 kDa), inducible,
structurally related proteins, which mediate chemotaxis
of various cell types including neutrophils, monocytes,
lymphocytes, basophils, eosinophils and fibroblasts to
sites of inflammation [1] and are implicated in many biological processes, such as migration of leukocytes,
embryogenesis, angiogenesis, hematopoiesis etc [2-5].
The biological activities of chemokines are mediated via
chemokine receptors, which belong to a large family of

rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled, seven transmembrane
domain receptors [6,7]. Chemokines and their receptors
were divided into four families (CXC, CC, C, and CX3C)
on the basis of cysteine residues in the ligands (here C
represents cysteine and X/X3 represents one or three nocysteine amino acids) [1]. Recently, a system of nomenclature was introduced in which each ligand and receptor
is identified by its subfamily with an identifying number
[8]. Thus, there exist CCR1-11, CXCR1-7, XCR1 (the
lymphotactin receptor), and CX3CR1 (the fractalkine
receptor) [9].
In human and mouse, seven different CXC chemokine
receptors denoted as CXCR1 to CXCR7 have so far been
reported, and these CXC chemokine receptors have roles
in chemotaxis of neutrophils, attraction of Th1 cells, or

effector of T cell generation [10]. Genomic structure and
expression of five CXCRs including CXCR1, 2, 3, 4, 7
have been characterized either in model fish and/or in
economically important fish species. For example,
CXCR1 has been reported in several species of fish, such
as common carp Cyprinus carpio and mandarin fish Siniperca chuatsi [11,12]; CXCR2 in common carp [12];
CXCR3 in grass carp Ctenopharyngodon idella [13];
CXCR4 in sea lamprey Petromyzon marinus, zebrafish
Danio rerio, common carp, rainbow trout Oncorhynchus
mykiss, sterlet Acipenser ruthenus [14-18], CXCR7 in
zebrafish and medaka Oryzias latipes [19,20]. In teleost
fish, the literature on the function of CXC chemokine
receptors is rather limited. It was only recently reported
that two CXCR4 genes, CXCR4a and CXCR4b, isolated
in zebrafish had roles in the development and migration
of cranial neural crest cells [21]. Similar to CXCR4, it was
demonstrated that CXCR7, which was recently revealed
to recognize the chemokine, stromal cell-derived factor-1
(SDF1) [22], played an essential role in primordium
migration [23], and CXCR4 and CXCR7 are antagonistic
in control of cell migration in the development of the
posterior lateral line [23].
CXCR5 was first reported from human Burkitt's lymphoma [24], whereafter the murine homologue of CXCR5
was cloned and its expression was found in a pattern similar to human CXCR5 [25]. In mammals, CXCR5 and its
ligand CXCL13 are responsible for the organization of B
cell follicles and the migration of B and T cells [26,27],
and involved in other functions such as in the attraction
of human metastatic neuroblastoma cells to the bone
marrow [28]. However, CXCR5 has not been identified in
any species of fish so far. In this study, CXCR5 was cloned
from the grass carp C. idella, an important fish in aquaculture industry of China [29]. Furthermore, its expression was examined in different organs/tissues, and in
response to the stimulation of peptidoglycan (PGN),
lipopolysaccharide (LPS), polyinosinic-polytidylic acid
sodium salt (Poly I:C) and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA).

Results
Cloning and characterization of grass carp CXCR5 cDNA

The grass carp CXCR5 (gcCXCR5) cDNA (GenBank
accession no. FJ825363) consists of 1648 bp with a 43 bp
5' untranslated region (UTR) and a 332 bp 3'-UTR with
poly(A) addition signal (AATAAA) and two mRNA instability motifs (ATTTA). The open reading frame of
gcCXCR5 cDNA encodes 381 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 43.34 kDa and an isoelectric
point of 8.40. Analysis of the putative amino acid
sequence by TMpred program suggests that gcCXCR5 is
a membrane protein with seven transmembrane helices
between amino acids 65-87, 99-121, 136-155, 176-198,
230-252, 272-294 and 314-336 (Figure 1). The extracellu-

lar regions of the gcCXCR5 contain four cysteines, presumably forming disulfide bonds. In the transmembrane
regions TM3-TM7 existed respectively two other
cysteine residues. Moreover, there are two cysteine intracellular regions at the carbon terminal. Analysis using
Signal P-N program showed that gcCXCR5 has no signal
peptide, but has a potential N-glycosylation sites at N34.
Using the Scanprosite programs in PROSITE database
http://ca.expasy.org/prosite, a sequence CGSLLLACISVDRYLAI (145-161 amino acids) containing the G-protein-coupled receptor family 1 signature was identified. It
was also revealed that the gcCXCR5 sequence contains
cAMP- and cGMP- dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites (at amino acids 85-88), tyrosine kinase
phosphorylation site (at amino acids 206-214), N-myristoylation sites (at amino acids 72-82, 125-130 and 215220), protein kinase C phosphorylation sites (at amino
acids 13-15, 224-226 and 255-257), and casein kinase II
phosphorylation sites (at amino acids 7-10, 30-33 and
367-370) (Figure 1).
The deduced amino acid sequence of the gcCXCR5
protein was compared with other chemokine receptors
by calculating the sequence identities using the MEGALIGN program. The full-length amino acid sequence of
gcCXCR5 has the highest identities with zebrafish
CXCR5 (66.6%), followed by stickleback CXCR5 (53.5%)
and fugu CXCR5 (51.6%). The identifies of gcCXCR5
with CXCR5 from human, mouse, rat and chicken are
38.8%, 37.8%, 37.6% and 37.6%, respectively. The identity
between gcCXCR5 and other reported chemokine receptors, CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3, CXCR4, CXCR6 and
CXCR7, ranges among 27.3-33.2%, 31.2-34.0%, 35.043.5%, 27.8-30.4%, 26.4-28.0%, and 36.5-37.1%, respectively. In the phylogenetic tree based on amino-acid
sequences from four CXCR1, three CXCR2, eight
CXCR3, six CXCR4, seven CXCR5, two CXCR6 and four
CXCR7 sequences, the gcCXCR5 was clustered closely
(bootstrap value > 99%) with CXCR5 in other fish species, and then with other CXCR5 in higher vertebrates
(Figure 2), and all other CXCRs with same identified
number were clustered into a same clade, except that
CXCR1 and CXCR2 were clustered together.
Characterization of gcCXCR5 genomic DNA

The gcCXCR5 gene has a length of 2081 bp (GenBank
accession no. FJ825364). Using BLAST2, the alignment of
gcCXCR5 cDNA sequence with gcCXCR5 genomic
sequence revealed that the gcCXCR5 gene is composed of
two exons and one intron. The first exon is 109 bp in
length, containing a short 5'-UTR and ORF of 23 amino
acids (Figure 3). The second exon is 1384 bp in length,
coding for the all seven transmembrane domains of
gcCXCR5. The intervening intron is 588 bp. The exon-

donor and acceptor sites for splicing (Figures 1 and 3).
Expression of gcCXCR5

In normal fish, the expression of gcCXCR5 was observed
in all the organs/tissues examined, with strong expression
in trunk kidney, spleen, intestine, head kidney, brain,
muscle, but almost undetectable expression in liver and
heart (Figure 4).
As shown in Figure 5, PGN injection significantly
induced gcCXCR5 expression in spleen, thymus and
trunk kidney, decreased expression in brain, gill, liver and
blood (P < 0.05), but no significant difference in other
organs/tissues (P > 0.05). LPS stimulation significantly
increased gcCXCR5 expression in spleen, trunk kidney,
blood, intestine and head kidney (P < 0.05), but decreased
expression in brain (P < 0.05), with no significant difference in other organs/tissues (P > 0.05). The induced

expression of gcCXCR5 by Poly I:C was observed in trunk
kidney, head kidney and gill (P < 0.05), decreased expression in brain and blood (P < 0.05). PHA significantly
induced gcCXCR5 in most organs/tissues (P < 0.05)
except brain and liver. The decreased expression of
gcCXCR5 by PHA was observed in brain (P < 0.05).

Discussion
CXCR5, also known as BLR1, has been identified as a
member of the lymphocyte-specific GPCR family [30].
The present study for the first time reported the cDNA
and genomic sequences of CXCR5 and its expression pattern in a teleost fish, the grass carp. In general, the
sequences of chemokine receptors have 25-80% aa identity. However, many other G-protein-coupled peptide

receptors (GPCRs) also have around 25% aa identity with
chemokine receptors, suggesting that the structural
boundary is not very sharp. Although they lack a single
structural signature, there are several features that
together are found more frequently among chemokine
receptors than in other types of GPCRs. These include a
length of 340-370 aa, an acidic N-terminal segment, the
sequence DRYLAIVHA or a variation of it in the second
intracellular loop, a short basic third intracellular loop,
and a cysteine in each of the four extracellular domains.
In addition, chemokine receptors contain numerous serines and threonines in the C-terminal tail that become
phosphorylated after receptor-ligand interaction [8,31].
The sequence of gcCXCR5 contains all these characters
except for the length of amino acid sequences. The alignment of gcCXCR5 amino acid sequence with CXCR5
sequences from other vertebrates revealed some conserved structural features. The presence of N-linked gly-

cosylation sites at N-terminus and/or in the second
extracellular loop is a common feature of chemokine
receptors, as recognized by other authors [7,13,32], and
all the CXCR5s including gcCXCR5 contain a conserved
N-linked glycosylation sites at N terminus. Furthermore,
the close phylogenetic relationship between gcCXCR5
and zebrafish CXCR5, and then other teleost fish CXCR5
may indicate their close evolutionary relationship. This,
together with other CXCR members, i.e., CXCR3,
CXCR4, CXCR5, CXCR6, which were clustered respectively into different clades, may reveal to some extent the
conservation of these members in vertebrates, except that
CXCR1 and CXCR2 were clustered in a same clade, as
shown also by other reports [22,33], which may imply a
similar evolutionary origin of these two receptors.
Similar to the genomic structures of CXCR5 in fugu
(ENSTRUG00000011814), human (Gene ID 643), mouse
(Gene ID 12145) and cow (Gene ID 497021), the

Xu et al. BMC Immunology 2010, 11:25

gcCXCR5 consists of two exons and one intron. Compared with the size of mammalian CXCR5 genomic
sequences, fish CXCR5 is much smaller in length. Despite
the difference in genomic size, vertebrate CXCR5 have
similar size in exons.
In mammals, much effort has been focused on identifying CXCR5 expression in different organs/tissues and
also in cell types [25,30]. Murine homologue of CXCR5
has been described as being expressed in lymphoid
organs, and murine CXCR5-specific RNA is detected
consistently at low levels in secondary lymphatic organs.
The CXCR5 gene is expressed regularly and strongly in
lymphomas of mature B cells but not in plasmacytomas
[25,30]. In the present study, constitutive expression of
CXCR5 was observed abundantly in trunk kidney, spleen,
head kidney, intestine, muscle and brain. In vivo, grass
carp CXCR5 expression was up-regulated mainly in
immune organs such as spleen, trunk kidney, head kidney
and blood, suggesting the potential function of gcCXCR5
in immune response. The induced expression of
gcCXCR5 in a wider range of organs/tissues containing
lymphocytes was consistent with the function of mammalian CXCR5, as reported to attract T lymphocytes
[26,27]. The immunostimulants used in the present study
include PGN, LPS and Poly I:C, which are derived from
Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacterial endotoxin and a synthetic double stranded RNA (dsRNA)
mimicking viral dsRNA, respectively; and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), known to cause leucocyte agglutination
and to stimulate the proliferation of lymphocytes [34].
The modulated difference of gcCXCR5 by different
immunostimulants may be owing to the effect of different
pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) which recognize
different bacterial and/or viral elements on different cell
types.
On the other hand, it is difficult to explain the downregulation of gcCXCR5 expression in brain after PGN,
LPS, Poly I:C and PHA stimulation. However, the higher
expression of gcCXCR5 in brain was similar to gcCXCR3
which also had abundant expression in brain [13]. Based
on the observation in mammals that CXCR2, CXCR3 and
CXCR4 were expressed in central nervous system by neurons and microglial cells etc [31,35-37], it is suggested
that brain chemokine receptors may promote the recruitment of haematopoietic cells from circulation, both as
part of normal surveillance and immunological control
within the brain, and as a component of the inflammatory
response [38]. Whether this is the case for fish CXCR5
and other fish CXCRs requires further study.
In addition, CXCR5 may be modulated by other cytogenes. Krumbholz et al. [39] reported that about 20% of
CSFCD4+ cells and almost all B cells expressed the
CXCL13 receptor CXCR5. In vitro, CXCL13 was produced by monocytes and at a much higher level by mac-

Page 6 of 10

rophages. CXCL13 mRNA and protein expression was
induced by TNF alpha and IL-1beta but inhibited by IL-4
and IFN gamma [39]. However, it would be interesting to
know if this is the case in fish.

Conclusions
In summary, gcCXCR5 consists of 1518 bp, encoding 381
amino acids which are predicted to have seven transmembrane helices. The characteristic residues (DRYLAIVHA) and conserved cysteine residues are located
predominantly in the extracellular regions and in the
third to seventh transmembrane domains. The gcCXCR5
was expressed in all tested organs/tissues. The expression
of gcCXCR5 was significantly modulated by peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid
sodium salt and phytohaemagglutinin.
Methods
Cloning of cDNA and genomic sequences

Based on the zebrafish and Tetraodon sequences of
CXCR5 homologues from Ensembl website, one pair of
degenerate primers F1 and R1 were designed to obtain
the internal region of gcCXCR5. The PCR cycling conditions were 1 cycle of 94°C for 5 min, 35 cycles of 94°C for
30 s, 57°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s, followed by 1 cycle of
72°C for 10 min. The resultant product was isolated using
the Gel Extraction Kit (Omega, USA), cloned into
pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa, Japan) and transformed into
Escherichia coli strain M15 competent cells by following
the manufacturer's instruction. Putative clones were
screened by PCR using the above primers under the same
PCR cycle conditions, and the selected clones were
sequenced. To obtain the full-length cDNA sequence of
gcCXCR5, 5' RACE and 3' RACE were performed by
using the gene-specific primers and adaptor primers. The
universal primers mix (UPM) was the mixture of the long
form (UPM Long) and short form (UPM Short).
For the first 3'-RACE, the PCR was initially performed
with primers UPM/3-F1 followed by a nested PCR with
primers UPM/3-F2. The annealing temperature of first
and second PCR was 63°C and 65°C, respectively. For the
second 3'-RACE, the PCR was performed with primers
UPM/3-F3 followed by a nested PCR with primers UPM/
3-F4. The annealing temperature of first and second PCR
was 63°C and 66°C, respectively.
For 5'-RACE, first strand cDNA synthesis is primed
using a gene-specific antisense primer (5-R1). Following
cDNA synthesis, the first strand product is purified from
unincorporated dNTPs and 5-R1. TdT (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) is used to add homopolymeric
tails to the 3' ends of the cDNA. Tailed cDNA is then
amplified by PCR using gene-specific antisense primer
(5-R2) and 5' abridged anchor primer (AAP). The annealing temperature of PCR was 55°C. A dilution of the origi-

nal PCR (0.1%) was re-amplified using a gene-specific
antisense nested primer (5-R3) and abridged universal
amplification primer (AUAP). The annealing temperature
of PCR was 65°C. All primers are listed in Table 1.
The genomic DNA was purified from trunk kidney of
healthy grass carp using Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega). Based on the full-length cDNA
sequence, D-F1 and D-R1 were designed to obtain the
full-length genomic sequence of gcCXCR5. PCR was performed using the primer pairs listed in Table 1.
Sequence analysis

Protein prediction was performed using software at the
ExPASy Molecular Biology Server http://www.expasy.ch/.
The putative ORFs were analyzed for the presence of signal
peptides using the algorithms Signal P 3.0. The intron/exon
structure of the identified genomic sequence was determined by alignment of the full-length cDNA to the genomic
sequence using BLAST2 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
blast/bl2seq/wblast2.cgi. The transmembrane regions

Page 7 of 10

were identified by the Tmpred http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/
services/TMHMM/. Putative domains and the G-protein-coupled receptors family 1 signature were identified
by PROSITE http://ca.expasy.org/prosite. A multiple
alignment was generated using the CLUSTAL W program. Sequence identities were calculated using the
MEGALIGN program within DNASTAR. Phylogenetic
analysis was performed using the neighbor-joining

trunk kidney, brain, liver, head kidney, intestine, spleen,
blood, gill and muscle from three grass carp were used for
RNA isolation using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) in
order to analyze the expression of gcCXCR5 in healthy
grass
carp.
To study the effect of different immunostimulants on
the expression of gcCXCR5, four stimulants with different origins and different functions were chosen. Phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) is an extract from plant with roles

in stimulating lymphocyte proliferation, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PGN) were derived from
Gram- negative and positive bacteria, respectively, while
Poly I:C mimics virus. Five groups of fish (three fish each)
were injected with either 500 μl PBS, 500 μl PGN (1 mg/
ml), 500 μl PHA (1 mg/ml), 500 μl Poly I:C (2 mg/ml), or
500 μl LPS (2 mg/ml). Twenty-four hours after injection,
total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Gibco) as
described by the manufacturer from organs/tissues of

interest, including brain, spleen, gill, trunk kidney, liver,
intestine, head kidney, thymus and blood from both
injected and control groups.
After treatment with RNase-free DNase I, 2 μg of total
RNA was reverse-transcribed respectively with Revert
Aid TM First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas). All
cDNA samples were stored at -20°C until used in realtime PCR assays.
Real-time quantitative PCR

Primer premier 5.0 was used for designing forward and
reverse primers. The primers which performed best in
real-time PCR were: gcCXCR5 Forward (RT-F1), Reverse
(RT-R1); β-actin Forward (β-actin F), Reverse (β-actin R)
(Table 1). The annealing temperatures for gcCXCR5 and
β-actin were 58°C, and resultant amplicons of both were
266 and 221 bp, respectively. The gcCXCR5 and β-actin
cDNA fragments were generated by PCR. Amplicons
were gel-purified, cloned into pMD18-T vector and
transformed into Escherichia coli strain DH5α competent
cells. Cloned amplicon sequences were confirmed by
sequencing. Plasmid DNA was obtained by using the
Plasmid mini kit I (Omega) by following the manufacturer's instructions. Serial tenfold dilutions of plasmid
DNA were used in PCR for establishing a standard curve.
PCR reactions were performed using Chromo 4™ Continuous Fluorescence Detector from MJ Research. Amplifications were carried out at a final volume of 20 μl
containing 1 μl DNA sample, 10 μl 2 × SYBR green Real
time PCR Master Mix (Toyobo, Japan), 2 μl of each
primer and 5 μl H2O. PCR amplification consisted of 5
min at 95°C, followed by 45 cycles consisting of 10 s at
94°C, 15 s at 58°C, 20 s at 72°C and plate-reading at 80°C.
The reaction carried out without DNA sample was used
as control. Melting curve analysis of amplification products was performed at the end of each PCR reaction to
confirm that a single PCR product was detected. Each
sample was run in triplicate. Standard curves were run on
the same plate.
Statistical analysis was performed using a one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA). A probability level of P <
0.05 was considered significant. Fold change was calculated as (Ts/Tn)/(Cs/Cn) where Ts equals the treated
sample assayed for the specific gene and Tn equals the
treated sample assayed for β-actin gene, and Cs and Cn
equal the calibrator group with the specific and normalizing gene, respectively [40]. All statistical analyses were
based on comparisons between the control and injection
groups.
