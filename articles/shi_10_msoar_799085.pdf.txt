MSOAR 2.0: Incorporating tandem duplications
into ortholog assignment based on genome
rearrangement
Guanqun Shi1*, Liqing Zhang2, Tao Jiang1

Abstract
Background: Ortholog assignment is a critical and fundamental problem in comparative genomics, since
orthologs are considered to be functional counterparts in different species and can be used to infer molecular
functions of one species from those of other species. MSOAR is a recently developed high-throughput system for
assigning one-to-one orthologs between closely related species on a genome scale. It attempts to reconstruct the
evolutionary history of input genomes in terms of genome rearrangement and gene duplication events. It assumes
that a gene duplication event inserts a duplicated gene into the genome of interest at a random location (i.e., the
random duplication model). However, in practice, biologists believe that genes are often duplicated by tandem
duplications, where a duplicated gene is located next to the original copy (i.e., the tandem duplication model).
Results: In this paper, we develop MSOAR 2.0, an improved system for one-to-one ortholog assignment. For a pair
of input genomes, the system first focuses on the tandemly duplicated genes of each genome and tries to identify
among them those that were duplicated after the speciation (i.e., the so-called inparalogs), using a simple
phylogenetic tree reconciliation method. For each such set of tandemly duplicated inparalogs, all but one gene
will be deleted from the concerned genome (because they cannot possibly appear in any one-to-one ortholog
pairs), and MSOAR is invoked. Using both simulated and real data experiments, we show that MSOAR 2.0 is able to
achieve a better sensitivity and specificity than MSOAR. In comparison with the well-known genome-scale ortholog
assignment tool InParanoid, Ensembl ortholog database, and the orthology information extracted from the wellknown whole-genome multiple alignment program MultiZ, MSOAR 2.0 shows the highest sensitivity. Although the
specificity of MSOAR 2.0 is slightly worse than that of InParanoid in the real data experiments, it is actually better
than that of InParanoid in the simulation tests.
Conclusions: Our preliminary experimental results demonstrate that MSOAR 2.0 is a highly accurate tool for oneto-one ortholog assignment between closely related genomes. The software is available to the public for free and
included as online supplementary material.

Background
Orthologs and paralogs are two different types of homologous genes that differ in the way that they evolved.
Orthologs are genes in different species that evolved
from a common ancestral gene due to speciation events
while paralogs are duplicated genes in the same genome
[1]. To better understand the evolutionary process, paralogs are further divided into two subtypes: outparalogs
and inparalogs [2]. With respect to a given speciation

event, outparalogs are genes duplicated before the speciation while inparalogs are genes duplicated after the
speciation. These concepts as well as the relationship
among orthologs, outparalogs and inparalogs are illustrated in Additional file 1, Figure S1, which depicts the
evolution of globin genes in human, mouse and rat.
Note that the orthology between two species is in general a many-to-many relationship. In other words, for a
pair of genomes, an ortholog group consists of a pair of
sets of inparalogs, one from each genome. The inparalogs in one set are co-orthologous to all the inparalogs
in the other. For each set of inparalogs on a genome,

there usually exists a gene that is the direct descendant
of the ancestral gene of such a set, which is referred to
as the “true examplar” by Sankoff [3], while the other
inparalogs in the set are duplicated from the true examplar gene. Therefore, for each ortholog group, we may
select a representative from each set of inparalogs (e.g.,
the exemplar gene) and define a one-to-one ortholog
pair consisting of the two representatives. Such an
ortholog pair may contain the two genes, one from each
set, that correspond the best in terms of their positions
on the genomes [4] or sequence similarity [2]. This
allows us to think of orthology as a one-to-one relationship, which could help simplify the discussion in many
cases and makes it possible to evaluate an ortholog
assignment result against the orthology benchmark
defined by gene symbols (which is a one-to-one
relationship).
Moreover, the one-to-one orthology relationship is
critically used in many comparative genomics studies,
such as the reconstruction of accurate gene trees [5],
alignment of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks
across multiple species [6], identification of functional
orthologs [7], evolutionary, comparative and systematic
studies in plants [8], and mapping of biological pathways
[9]. (One-to-one orthologs are called “true orthologs” in
[7] and “single copy orthologous genes” in [8].) Note
that once a one-to-one ortholog pair is specified for an
ortholog group, all other pairs of genes from the group
will be regarded as false positives (with respect to the
one-to-one orthology relationship). In this paper, we are
interested in assigning orthologs as a one-to-one relationship. To avoid ambiguity, we will add the prefix
“one-to-one” in front of such orthologs.
Clearly, it is easy to identify the one-to-one ortholog
pairs between two species if the duplication history of
the genes on the two genomes is given (relative to their
speciation event). Unfortunately, this evolutionary process is unknown. What we know is all the genes in the
contemporary genomes. In order to find the most probable one-to-one ortholog assignment between two genomes, we need to reconstruct the true evolutionary
history.
Existing Work on Ortholog Assignment

There exist many algorithms and tools for ortholog
assignment, including the well-known COG system [10],
InParanoid [2,11], OrthoMCL [12], HomoloGene [13],
TreeFam [14], PhyOP [15], and Ensembl Compara [16],
just to name a few. A recent comprehensive review on
ortholog assignment tools in the public domain can be
found in [17]. The first four tools, i.e., COG, InParanoid,
OrthoMCL and HomoloGene, are basically sequence
similarity based methods that calculate pairwise similarity scores and employ some simple clustering algorithms
to identify ortholog groups. For example, InParanoid

Page 2 of 14

assigns main ortholog pairs as the pairs of protein
sequences with the highest bidirectional BLASTp scores
(i.e., bidirectional best hits, or BBHs), and uses them as
“seeds” to identify inparalogs from both species by
applying a heuristic clustering algorithm [2]. TreeFam,
PhyOP and Ensembl Compara, on the other hand, explicitly reconstruct phylogenetic trees to infer the orthology relationship. Ensembl Compara, in particular, is a
computational pipeline that combines some clustering
method with phylogenetic tree reconciliation. It provides
one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many orthology
relationships for more than 30 eukaryotic species [16].
However, none of these methods take gene order and
genome rearrangement into account when they assign
orthologs. It has been shown that genome rearrangement is very common between two closely related genomes [18-21], and thus the gene order information may
help improve the accuracy of ortholog assignment.
By combining both sequence similarity and gene order
information, a high-throughput one-to-one or-tholog
assignment system called MSOAR [4,22] has recently
been developed. The system attempts to reconstruct the
evolutionary history of the genes in the input genomes
in terms of genome rearrangement and gene duplication
events, and tries to minimize the RD (rearrangement
and duplication) distance under the parsimony principle.
MSOAR considers four genome rearrangement events
including reversal (i.e., inversion), translocation, fusion,
and fission, and assumes that a gene duplication event
inserts a duplicated gene into the concerned genome at
a random location (i.e., the random duplication model).
For the convenience of the reader, an outline of the
major algorithmic steps in MSOAR is sketched in Figure
1. In particular, MSOAR attempts to remove false oneto-one ortholog pairs that involve genes randomly duplicated after the speciation in the “noise” gene pair detection step. Such a (false) ortholog pair usually incurs a
great cost in the rearrangement distance between the
genomes, and thus we would be able to reduce the RD
distance by “uncoupling” (i.e., removing) the pair. However, in reality, randomly duplicated genes only account
for a part of all duplicated genes. Recent studies have
shown that at least 30% of duplicated genes are found
next to their original copies (i.e., in tandem positions)
[23,24].
Gene Duplication Models

The importance of gene duplication in molecular evolution is well established [25,26]. However, the biological
mechanism behind gene duplication has been unknown
for quite many years. Recently, biologists proposed three
different mechanisms for gene duplication based on the
size of the duplication and whether they involve an
RNA intermediate [27,28]: retrotransposition, tandem
duplication, and genome duplication.

Figure 1 An outline of MSOAR.

Retrotransposition describes the integration of a
reverse transcribed mRNA into the genome in a random
manner (see Additional file 1, Figure S2), and is the
cause of random duplications. Tandem duplication is
one of the possible outcomes of “unequal crossover”,
which results from the homologous recombination
between paralogous sequences (see Additional file 1,
Figure S3). As a result, genes are duplicated next to
their original copies in tandem arrays on the genome,
which are known as TAGs (i.e., tandemly arrayed genes)
[23]. Genome duplication is probably due to the lack of
disjunction between daughter chromosomes after DNA
replication, and occurs more in plants than in animals.
Recent studies show that there is another type of largescale duplications, segmental duplication, which involves
1 kb~400 kb nucleotides, though the molecular mechanism of segmental duplication is still unclear [27].
An Improved Ortholog Assignment System

Although MSOAR is able to identify most randomly
duplicated inparalogs in the “noise” gene pair detection
step, it is incapable of catching inparalogs that are produced by tandem duplications, which prevents MSOAR
from identifying false one-to-one ortholog pairs that
involve two duplicated inparalogs in TAGs from both
genomes. See the examples in Figures 2 and 3.
In Figures 2 and 3, we assume that the genes with the
same letter from the two genomes represent true oneto-one orthologs, and all duplications happened after

the speciation in both genomes. For example, in Figure
3, (a1, a1) is a true one-to-one ortholog pair while (a2,
a3) and (a4, a5) are not. The genes a2 and a3 in Figure 2
and genes a2, a3, a4 and a5 in Figure 3 are all duplicated
from gene a1 after the speciation, and thus are inparalogs of a1 . In both cases, MSOAR first tries to assign
one-to-one orthology between all pairs of genes and calculates the RD distance between the two genomes.
However, in the “noise” gene pair detection step,
MSOAR is able to identify the false one-to-one ortholog
pair (a2, a3) in Figure 2 since the RD distance between
the two genomes will decrease by 1 (i.e., 3 fewer reversals and 2 more duplications) if this pair is removed.
However, if the duplicated genes are in TAGs, as shown
in Figure 3, removing any of the pairs (a2, a3) and (a4,
a 5 ) will not affect the number of reversals but will
increase the number of duplications by 2, thus increasing the RD distance between the two genomes. Since
MSOAR tries to find an assignment to minimize the RD
distance between the two genomes, it will correctly
identify the false one-to-one ortholog pair (a 2 , a 3 ) in
Figure 2 while incorrectly keep both false one-to-one
ortholog pairs (a 2 , a 3 ) and (a 4 , a 5 ) in Figure 3 in the
assignment.
In this paper, we incorporate the tandem duplication
model into MSOAR, and develop an improved system,
simply called MSOAR 2.0, to assign one-to-one ortholog
pairs between two genomes. The idea is to consider

tandemly duplicated genes first and try to identify the
inparalogy relationship among them using a simple phylogenetic tree reconciliation method. For each set of
inparalogs (on the same genome), all but one gene will
be deleted from the concerned genome before MSOAR
is invoked. Our experimental results demonstrate that
this pre-processing step could indeed remove many false
positives correctly and thus greatly improve the specificity of MSOAR.

Results and Discussion
The system MSOAR 2.0 has been implemented as a C+
+ application on a standard Linux system. Its main
steps, as outlined in Figure 4, include: (i) the construction of gene families using a clustering approach, (ii) the
identification of inparalogs in TAGs using a simple phylogenetic analysis, (iii) the invocation of MSOAR after
removing inparalogs in TAGs, and (iv) the identification
of additional one-to-one ortholog pairs in a post-processing step. The detailed description of each of the main
steps is given in the Methods section. The software is
available to the public for free and included as an online
supplementary material in Additional file 2.
In order to test the performance of MSOAR 2.0, we
apply it to both simulated and real data, and compare
our results with MSOAR [4], the popular ortholog
assignment tool InParanoid [11], Ensembl ortholog database [16] and the orthologs extracted from the wholegenome multiple alignment program MultiZ [29].
Simulation Results

To assess the accuracy of one-to-one ortholog assignment, we simulate two input (single-chromosomal) genomes by using duplications, reversals, and point
mutations. The simulation is controlled by a set of 4
parameters (k, p, a, b), where k denotes the number of

duplications in the ancestral genome before the speciation, p is the total number of genome-level evolutionary
events (i.e., duplications and reversals) on each genome
after the speciation, a is the percentage of duplications
among the p events, and b is the percentage of tandem
duplications among all duplications. A detailed description of the actual simulation process is given in the
Methods section.
After generating two input genomes, we run MSOAR
2.0, MSOAR, and InParanoid separately. From the outputs of the three programs, we can easily compare their
prediction accuracies in terms of sensitivity (i.e., the
number of true positive pairs assigned divided by the
total number of assignable true positive pairs) and specificity (i.e., the number of true positive pairs assigned
divided by the total number of assigned pairs). Note
that InParanoid actually outputs ortholog groups. For
each ortholog group, we take the first pair of genes in
the group as the one-to-one ortholog pair (which is
referred to as the main ortholog pair in [2]).
Since different parameters produce different input
genomes, which may affect the prediction accuracies of
the three programs, the parameters are varied as follows.
We use a default parameter set and change the value of
one parameter at one time. Based on recent studies on
the relative ratios of various genome-level evolutionary
events [23,30], we choose to use (10, 50, 75%, 50%) as
our default parameter set. For each parameter set, 50
random datasets are simulated and the average prediction accuracies of the three programs are calculated.
The performance of the three programs on various parameter sets are shown in Figures 5, 6, 7, and 8.
From Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8, we can see that parameter
k has little effect on the prediction accuracies of the
three programs as it only defines the number of

outparalogs. Parameter p, on the other hand, has a great
impact on the performance of all the programs. With
the increase of p, the prediction accuracies of all the
three programs sharply decrease. This is because when
the number of evolutionary events increases, it is more
difficult for MSOAR and MSOAR 2.0 to correctly
reconstruct the evolutionary history based on the parsimony principle. Also orthologous genes may become
less similar to each other for InParanoid to correctly
identify them based on sequence similarity. Parameter a
defines the ratio between duplications and reversals. As
a goes up, the number of duplications increases while
the number of reversals decreases. It becomes easier for

MSOAR and MSOAR 2.0 to correctly identify reversals
and assign one-to-one orthologs while it becomes
harder for InParanoid to differentiate main orthologs
from their duplicated inparalogs due to the large number of duplications. Parameter b defines the ratio
between tandem duplications and random duplications.
As the ratio of tandem duplications goes up, the sensitivities of all three programs increase. This is due to the
definition of true positives (TPs) in the simulation test.
For each pair of orthologous TAGs from the two genomes, any pair of genes consisting of one gene from
each TAG could be counted as a TP since these pairs
are indistinguishable. However, at most one pair in the

orthologous TAGs is counted as a TP. So, when the
number of tandem duplications increases, all three programs output more TPs. As for specificity, since
MSOAR 2.0 removes most of the inparalogs in TAGs
based on the phylogenetic analysis and only the main
ortholog pairs found by InParanoid are considered, the
two programs do not introduce more false positives
(FPs) when the number of tandem duplications
increases. Thus, the specificities of these two programs
both increase. On the other hand, MSOAR may tend to

assign more than one one-to-one ortholog pairs between
two orthologous TAGs. This results in more FPs for
MSOAR and an almost unchanged specificity.
The simulation results show that, in general, MSOAR
2.0 and MSOAR are more accurate than InParanoid in
terms of both sensitivity and specificity on randomly
simulated data. The sensitivity of MSOAR 2.0 is slightly
better than that of MSOAR while its specificity is significantly (2% ~ 5%) higher than that of MSOAR. Note
that the design of our simulation study was rather simplistic and the genomes simulated were not of real genome sizes. Hence, the above simulation results might
not faithfully reflect the relative performance of InParanoid, MSOAR and MSOAR 2.0 on real data.
Real Data Experiments

In order to evaluate the performance of MSOAR 2.0 on
real data, we apply MSOAR 2.0 to several real datasets.
Since the human genome is the best annotated genome
and has been used as the reference genome to assign
gene symbols for other species, we use it as the “center”
in our pairwise comparisons and compare it with four
other mammalian genomes, mouse, rat, chimpanzee,
and macaque that have been completely sequenced. The
detailed procedure for downloading and pre-processing
these genomes is described in the Methods section.
Results on Human, Mouse and Rat

For the one-to-one ortholog assignments between
human and mouse and between human and rat, Table 1
shows the contributions of each major step in MSOAR
2.0. The phylogenetic analysis step is able to identify
more than 1,000 duplicated inparalogs in TAGs in each
species (1,232/2,675 for human-mouse and 1,354/2,216
for human-rat), and remove most of them before
MSOAR is invoked. Then one-to-one orthology is
assigned by MSOAR on the remaining genes on each
genome. Finally, in the post-processing step, MSOAR
2.0 is able to catch a few hundred one-to-one ortholog
pairs (113 for human-mouse and 112 for human-rat)
from the “gaps” between consecutive orthologous blocks
on each genome.
In order to validate the prediction results of MSOAR
2.0, we choose to use gene symbols. Gene symbols are
used by researchers to refer to a specific gene of interest
across species. Each symbol for a species should be
unique and each gene within a genome should be given
only one approved gene symbol [31]. The nomenclature
of a gene is done by the nomenclature committees for
each species. At present, there are only three official
nomenclature committees in the world, for human,
mouse, and rat respectively. So only these three species
have official gene symbols. To obtain the most accurate
gene symbol lists, we download the most recent gene
symbols for human, mouse, rat from HGNC http://
www.genenames.org/, MGI http://www.informatics.jax.

org/, and RGD http://rgd.mcw.edu/ respectively, all of
which are the official nomenclature committees for the
involved species. Note that since some gene symbols
were assigned using information from some orthology
databases, we should take the validation results based
on gene symbols with a grain of salt. However, everything considered, gene symbols may still be the best
available benchmark for validating genome-wide one-toone ortholog assignment results.
To compare the performance of MSOAR 2.0 with that
of MSOAR, InParanoid, the Ensembl ortholog database,
and MultiZ, we consider the gene symbols of each output ortholog pair. Some genes may not have official
gene symbols. Some symbols may not be meaningful, e.
g., when they are composed of “LOC” and gene ID, or
when the gene functions have not yet been validated. In
the latter case, the genes only have transcript identifiers
(e.g., gene symbols with the prefix “OTTMUSG” or the
suffix “RIK” in the mouse genome). For each pair of
orthologs, if both genes have identical official gene symbols, we count it as a true positive pair (i.e., TP). If the
genes have different official gene symbols, we count it
as a false positive pair (i.e., FP). If only one gene in the
pair has an official gene symbol and another gene on
the other genome (which is not in the pair) has the
same gene symbol, then this pair is also considered as a
false positive pair. For all other cases, we deem the pair

as an unknown pair and ignore it in the accuracy assessment. We also calculate the assignable true one-to-one
ortholog pairs between two species by counting the
number of identical gene symbols. The performance of
the five methods validated using gene symbols is shown
in Table 2. The actual one-to-one ortholog assignment
results of MSOAR 2.0 as well as the raw data and the
MSOAR 2.0 software source code can be downloaded
from the MSOAR website http://msoar.cs.ucr.edu/.
Table 2 suggests that MSOAR 2.0 achieves the best
sensitivity among the five programs although its specificity is slightly worse than that of InParanoid. A detailed
analysis on the differences among the ortholog assignment results by these programs is given in Table 3.
Since InParanoid is a sequence similarity based method,
it produces ortholog groups solely based on sequence
similarity. In order to compare the performance of InParanoid with MSOAR 2.0 properly, we take the first pair of
each ortholog group output by InParanoid, i.e., the main
ortholog pair [2], as the one-to-one ortholog pairs assigned
by InParanoid. As a result, all of the main ortholog pairs
assigned by InParanoid are BBHs. Although many of the
true one-to-one ortholog pairs may be indeed BBHs, some
of them are not. In fact, more than 80% of the true oneto-one ortholog pairs assigned by MSOAR 2.0 but missed
by InParanoid in the human-mouse and human-rat comparisons (408/487 for human-mouse and 400/429 for

In order to assess the accuracy of InParanoid, we take the first pair of genes in each ortholog group (i.e., the main ortholog pair of the group) as a one-to-one
ortholog pair. For the Ensembl ortholog database, we directly download all the ortholog pairs from Ensembl Biomart Browser, which includes one-to-one, one-tomany, and many-to-many orthology relationships. In order to extract the orthology information from MultiZ, we download the whole-genome multiple alignment
for human, mouse and rat from UCSC genome browser, and map the annotated genes to the alignment based on their coordinates on each genome.

human-rat) are not BBHs as shown in Table 3 (the first
two columns). An example from the human-mouse comparison can be seen in Figure 9. Here, the true one-to-one
ortholog pair (ITIH2, Itih2) is missed by InParanoid since
ITIH2 and Itih2 are not BBHs. But MSOAR 2.0 was able
to catch this pair correctly.
While we mainly focus on finding the one-to-one
orthology relationship between two genomes, the
Ensembl ortholog database presents orthology in general
as a many-to-many relationship. Thus, for each ortholog
group, it outputs all pairs of genes consisting of one
gene from one genome and another from the other. As
a result, the specificity of the Ensembl ortholog database
is quite low because each large ortholog group may
result in many false positives. (Hence, our measure of
specificity is unfair to Ensembl since it treats orthology
as a one-to-one relationship.) What is interesting is that
even though it outputs a large number of ortholog pairs,
its sensitivity is still a little bit worse than that of
MSOAR 2.0 in both human-mouse and human-rat comparisons as shown in Table 2. It is interesting to observe
that most of the false positive pairs output by Ensembl
but not by MSOAR 2.0 (i.e., 2,664/2,997 for the humanmouse comparison and 2,366/2,681 for the human-rat
comparison) were actually found by MSOAR 2.0 to be
inparalogs that appear in some TAGs, as shown in
Table 3 (the two middle columns). See Figure 10 for an
example of inparalogs in TAGs caught by MSOAR 2.0.

The last two columns of Table 3 clearly demonstrate that MSOAR 2.0 achieves a better specificity
than MSOAR because of its treatment of TAGs, since
most of the false positives output by MSOAR but not
by MSOAR 2.0 (312/330 and 299/311 for the humanmouse and human-rat comparisons, respectively)
were identified as inparalogs in TAGs by MSOAR
2.0. For a detailed example where MSOAR 2.0 is able
to catch false positives output by MSOAR, see again
Figure 10.
MultiZ is generally viewed as a whole-genome multiple alignment program, but we can easily extract
orthology information from the multiple alignment
produced by MultiZ. To compare with the performance of MultiZ in one-to-one ortholog assignment,
we download the human, mouse and rat genome alignment by MultiZ from UCSC genome browser, and
map the annotated genes to the alignment according
to their coordinates on each genome. If a gene contains several regions which are aligned to different
locations belonging to different genes on another genome, then it forms a one-to-many orthology relationship and all pairs are counted in the same way as we
dealt with the Ensembl ortholog database. Table 2
shows that MultiZ is worse than InParanoid in both
sensitivity and specificity. Since both methods are
based on sequence similarity, we will not include
MultiZ in further comparative studies.

Figure 9 A real example of non-BBH true one-to-one ortholog pairs in the human-mouse comparison caught by MSOAR 2.0 in the
post-processing step. Four one-to-one ortholog pairs were assigned by MSOAR between two corresponding orthologous blocks on human
chromosome 10 (7,244,255 bp-7,900,507 bp) and mouse chromosome 2 (9,977,663 bp-10,636,794 bp). The genes ITIH2 and Itih2 were not
assigned orthology by MSOAR, since ITIH2 is not among the top hits of Itih2. However, because Itih2 is the best hit of ITIH2 and the genes are
located in corresponding “gaps”, MSOAR 2.0 outputs them as an additional one-to-one ortholog pair.

Figure 10 Comparison of ortholog assignments made by Ensembl, MSOAR and MSOAR 2.0 for the two segments of human
chromosome 2 (178,123,219 bp-178,685,428 bp) and mouse chromosome 2 (75,773,906 bp-76,192,000 bp). Among the 7 pairs of genes
illustrated in the figure, only (TTC30B, Ttc30b) and (PDE11A, Pde11a) are known one-to-one ortholog pairs according to gene symbols, as
indicated by solid lines. Since the Ensembl ortholog database includes many-to-many relationship, it outputs 7 ortholog pairs, i.e., (TTC30B,
Ttc30b), (TTC30B, Ttc30a2), (TTC30B, Ttc30a1), (TTC30A, Ttc30b), (TTC30A, Ttc30a2), (TTC30A, Ttc30a1), and (PDE11A, Pde11a), introducing 5 false
ortholog pairs, as indicated by dashed lines. MSOAR assigns three one-to-one ortholog pairs as indicated by the arrows in the figure, i.e.,
(TTC30B, Ttc30b), (TTC30A, Ttc30a1), and (PDE11A, Pde11a), including one false one-to-one ortholog pair. MSOAR 2.0, however, identifies TTC30A
as an inparalog of TTC30B on the human genome and Ttc30a2 and Ttc30a1 as inparalogs of Ttc30b on the mouse genome during the
phylogenetic analysis of TAGs, and removes them before invoking MSOAR. Thus, MSOAR 2.0 only outputs two one-to-one ortholog pairs, i.e.,
(TTC30B, Ttc30b) and (PDE11A, Pde11a), both of which are true positives.

Results on Human, Chimpanzee and Macaque

Since chimpanzee and macaque do not have official
gene symbols, we only compare our assignment results
with those of InParanoid and the Ensembl ortholog
database. Figures 11 and 12 use Venn diagrams to show
the commonality and difference among the ortholog
pairs assigned by MSOAR 2.0, InParanoid, and the
Ensembl ortholog database. We see that the three programs share more than 75% of the ortholog pairs. InParanoid outputs the least number of unique ortholog pairs
while Ensembl has the most. More than 70% of the
ortholog pairs unique to Ensembl are found to be inparalogs in TAGs (results not shown).
Table 4 shows the number of ortholog pairs output by
MSOAR 2.0 that are shared by at least one of the other
two programs. We observe that the closer the compared
species is to human, the more support the result of
MSOAR 2.0 receives from the other programs. For a
pair of very closely related species, such as human and
chimpanzee, the one-to-one ortholog pairs assigned by
MSOAR 2.0 have nearly 99% support from at least one
of the other two programs, which is consistent with our
expectation, and confirms that MSOAR 2.0 is a highly
accurate tool for one-to-one ortholog assignment
between closely related species. (Note that the same
claim can be made for the other two programs. In other
words, ortholog assignment in general becomes easier
for closely related species.)
Finally, we also observe that the number of inparalogs
found in human by MSOAR 2.0 increases with the
increase of evolutionary distance between human and
the other species, as shown in Table 5. This is consistent with the definition of inparalogs.

Conclusions
In this paper, we have incorporated a new gene duplication model, the tandem duplication model, into
MSOAR, and developed an improved system of one-toone ortholog assignment by combining gene phylogeny
and genome rearrangement. By comparison with
MSOAR, InParanoid, the Ensembl ortholog database,
and MultiZ on both simulated and real data, we showed
that MSOAR 2.0 achieves the best sensitivity while
maintaining a high specificity. Although MSOAR 2.0 has
a slightly lower specificity as compared to InParanoid on
real data using gene symbols as the benchmark (e.g., in
the human-mouse comparison, 90.13% for InParanoid
vs. 89.50% for MSOAR 2.0), it nevertheless identified
several hundred of true one-to-one ortholog pairs that
were missed by InParanoid. Because the majority of the
“missed” one-to-one orthologs are not BBHs, which are
what the InParanoid assignment is based on, MSOAR
2.0 clearly addresses a weakness of InParanoid. Moreover, MSOAR 2.0 shows a better specificity in the simulation tests. Note that MSOAR 2.0 also reconstructs the
evolutionary history in terms of gene duplication and
genome rearrangement, which could be of independent
interest. Although Ensembl tends to assign a higher
number of ortholog pairs than both InParanoid and
MSOAR 2.0, MSOAR 2.0 outperforms it in terms of not
only specificity but also sensitivity.
We evaluated the performance of the programs by
computer simulations and gene symbols. However,
simulations could be limited because the real evolutionary processes are much more complicated than what we
can simulate. Furthermore, the use of gene symbols is
not always feasible as many species do not have

standard gene symbol assignment. We need to develop
additional validation methods such as incorporating
other available information, e.g., gene functions. In addition, with the discovery of more mechanisms of gene
evolution, new models of gene duplication (e.g., segmental duplications) and genome operations (e.g., double cut
and join or DCJ), have been proposed. How to incorporate these new gene duplication models and operations
into MSOAR 2.0 is our next challenge.

Methods
Gene Family Definition and Construction

A gene family is defined to be the set of genes that are all
descended from a common ancestral gene [4,14]. Given
two input genomes, our improved system starts by constructing gene families for all the genes on both genomes.
We mix all protein sequences on both genomes and calculate the pairwise similarity scores by applying an allversus-all BLASTp comparison [32]. By analyzing the
results of BLASTp, we obtain a square similarity matrix,
whose elements contain sequence similarity measurements for each pair of proteins in the dataset. Gene
families can be calculated using the MCL (Markov clustering) algorithm [33] with default parameters.
Based on probability and graph flow theory, MCL
simulates random walks on a graph using Markov
matrices to determine the transition probabilities among
the vertices of the graph. Unlike many other protein
sequence clustering algorithms, MCL is able to deal
with the presence of multi-domain proteins, promiscuous domains and fragmented proteins, making it one of
the most widely used clustering algorithms in bioinformatics [33,34]. Some papers use MCL directly to identify ortholog groups such as OrthoMCL [12], while
some others use TribeMCL (an extension of MCL) as a
tool to find paralogs within a genome [23]. In our

system, we apply MCL to cluster all homologous genes
on both genomes (including all possible orthologs and
paralogs) into gene families.
DNA-based Gene Tree Reconstruction

For each gene family, we perform multiple sequence
alignment using MAFFT [35,36] on the amino acid
sequences of the genes and then calculate a DNA-based
distance matrix. MAFFT is a rapid multiple sequence
alignment tool based on fast Fourier transform, which
has shown to be more accurate than other available
tools including TCoffee [37] and ClustalW [38]. Moreover, MAFFT (with the fast mode) is able to align a
large number (e.g., several hundred) of sequences on a
standard desktop PC in a few minutes.
Since DNA-based distance measure is shown to be
more accurate than either protein-based distance or dSbased distance (i.e., synonymous substitution rate) [5],
we calculate the DNA-based distance for each gene
family using the PHYLIP’s DNADIST program [39] with
the F84 nucleotide substitution model [40,41]. To obtain
DNA sequence alignments, we reverse translate the
amino acid sequence of each gene into its corresponding
codon sequence using the program PAL2NAL [42] and
the given genome sequences and then map the codon
sequence onto its respective protein sequence alignment.
After getting the DNA-based distance matrix, we use
the algorithm BIONJ [43] to reconstruct a gene tree for
each family. Not only is BIONJ the best neighbor-joining
algorithm for phylogenetic reconstruction, it was found
to have a competitive (if not better) accuracy as many
other popular phylogenetic reconstruction methods
including PHYML [44], MrBayes [45] and PAML [46] in
genome-wide reconstruction of gene trees according to a
recent study [5]. Although maximum-likelihood methods
are known to be more accurate than distance-based
methods in general phylogenetic reconstruction, we
chose a distance-based method here mostly because of its
efficiency since MSOAR 2.0 has to deal with many large
gene families consisting of very long sequences on real
data. In order to produce a rooted gene tree for each
family, we introduce before BIONJ is run an artificial
outgroup gene whose distance to each of the other genes
in the family is twice the maximum distance in the original distance matrix. This can be achieved by simply adding a new row and a new column in the original distance
matrix. Running BIONJ on this expanded distance matrix
is equivalent to mid-point rooting [47].
Gene Duplication Dating on the Gene Tree

Once a gene tree is reconstructed, we need to label each
of its internal nodes as either a duplication event or a
speciation event. This process is a special case of the
gene duplication dating problem, or the problem of
reconciling a gene tree with a species tree. The phylogenetic tree reconciliation problem has been studied

Shi et al. BMC Bioinformatics 2010, 11:10
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/11/10

extensively in the literature, and many exact and heuristic algorithms have been proposed (see, e.g., [48]). In
our case, since only two species are involved, we propose a straightforward algorithm to date the duplication
events in linear time.
To avoid postulating unnecessary gene losses, every
internal node with descendant genes from the same species is labeled as a duplication event. Then, the lowest
internal nodes with descendant genes from both species
are labeled as speciation events. All ancestral nodes of
the speciation nodes must be labeled as duplication
events since there are only two species. An example of
such a gene duplication dating algorithm is shown in
Additional file 1, Figure S4.
Identification of Inparalogs in TAGs

After dating duplications in a gene tree, we may deem
each set of genes duplicated after the speciation event as
a potential set of inparalogs (e.g., M A and MB in Additional file 1, Figure S4). In order to confirm a potential
set of inparalogs, we need to consider the positions of the
genes on the concerned genome. If the potential inparalogs are adjacent to each other on the genome, i.e., they
appear in the same TAG, then we define them as inparalogs. For each such set of inparalogs, at most one gene
can be included in a one-to-one ortholog pair. Since
these genes appear in tandem, it would make no difference to the RD distance (which is the objective function
of MSOAR) which of them is chosen to represent the set
in the one-to-one ortholog pair. Thus, we will keep the
gene that has the highest similarity score against any
gene in the other genome and remove the other inparalogs in the same set so they will not be considered by
MSOAR later on. If some potential inparalogs are separated by other genes on the genome, they will all be kept
at this step and dealt with by MSOAR later on.
Invocation of MSOAR and Post-Processing

After removing duplicated inparalogs in TAGs on each
genome, MSOAR is now invoked on the remaining
genes. To further improve the performance of MSOAR,
we use a post-processing step. If we consider the positions of the one-to-one orthologs assigned by MSOAR
on each genome, we find that in many cases a large
consecutive block of assigned genes on one genome are
orthologous to a consecutive block of assigned genes on
the other genome with the same or reverse orientation.
However, in some cases, there is a single unassigned
gene (called a “gap”) in each of the blocks forming an
orthologous pair, and the gap appears at the same relative location in both blocks (see Figure 9 for an illustration). If the sequences of the two genes in the
corresponding gaps are sufficiently similar (e.g., at least
one of the genes is the best hit of the other), then we
deem the two genes as a one-to-one ortholog pair and
add the pair to the output list.

Generation of Simulated Data

The simulation is controlled by a set of 4 parameters (k, p,
a, b) which are defined in the Simulation Results section.
The simulation is performed as follows. We first generate
an ancestral genome G with 100 genes, each of which is a
random sequence of 3000 nucleotides (i.e., 1000 codons).
We randomly perform k duplications in G to obtain
another genome H. Then, a speciation happens and the
genome H evolves into two contemporary genomes H1
and H2. The evolution from genome H to each of the contemporary genomes involves p evolutionary events, including p·a duplications and p · (1 - a) reversals. Among all
duplications, b of them are tandem (i.e., we randomly
choose a gene and insert its copy next to it) while the
others are random (i.e., we randomly choose a gene and
insert its copy randomly into the genome). In order to
simulate the sequence change of each gene along the evolutionary process, we set a constant mutation rate μ = 1%
to allow each gene on the genomes to have up to 3000 μ =
30 random mutations of its nucleotides between every two
evolutionary events (i.e., 15 random nucleotide mutations
would be performed on the average).
Real Data

Protein sequences, transcripts, and gene locations for all
five species, human (Homo sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), rat (Rattus norvegicus), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) and macaque (Macaca mulatta) (version 52,
December 2008) were downloaded from Ensembl genome browser http://www.ensembl.org/. Genes annotated
as novel, supercontig, or mitochondrial are removed,
and only protein-coding genes with known chromosome
locations are kept. For genes with alternative splicing
variants, we use their longest transcripts. Similar methods have been used in the previous studies [23,49].
After such pre-processing, we obtained 21,164, 23,228,
22,490, 18,572, and 21,023 genes for human, mouse, rat,
chimpanzee, and macaque, respectively.
