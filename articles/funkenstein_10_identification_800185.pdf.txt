Identification of a novel transforming growth
factor-β (TGF-β6) gene in fish: regulation in skeletal
muscle by nutritional state
Research article

Bruria Funkenstein*1, Elena Olekh1 and Sonia B Jakowlew2

Abstract
Background: The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) family constitutes of dimeric proteins that regulate the
growth, differentiation and metabolism of many cell types, including that of skeletal muscle in mammals. The potential
role of TGF-βs in fish muscle growth is not known.
Results: Here we report the molecular characterization, developmental and tissue expression and regulation by
nutritional state of a novel TGF-β gene from a marine fish, the gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata. S. aurata TGF-β6 is
encoded by seven exons 361, 164, 133, 111, 181, 154, and 156 bp in length and is translated into a 420-amino acid
peptide. The exons are separated by six introns: >643, 415, 93, 1250, 425 and >287 bp in length. Although the gene
organization is most similar to mouse and chicken TGF-β2, the deduced amino acid sequence represents a novel TGFβ that is unique to fish that we have named TGF-β6. The molecule has conserved putative functional residues,
including a cleavage motif (RXXR) and nine cysteine residues that are characteristic of TGF-β. Semi-quantitative analysis
of TGF-β6 expression revealed differential expression in various tissues of adult fish with high levels in skin and muscle,
very low levels in liver, and moderate levels in other tissues including brain, eye and pituitary. TGF-β6 is expressed in
larvae on day of hatching and increases as development progresses. A fasting period of five days of juvenile fish
resulted in increased levels of TGF-β6 expression in white skeletal muscle compared to that in fed fish, which was
slightly attenuated by one injection of growth hormone.
Conclusion: Our findings provide valuable insights about genomic information and nutritional regulation of TGF-β6
which will aid the further investigation of the S. aurata TGF-β6 gene in association with muscle growth. The finding of a
novel TGF-β6 molecule, unique to fish, will contribute to the understanding of the evolution of the TGF-β family of
cytokines in vertebrates.
Background
The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily
constitutes of a large number of structurally related,
extracellular polypeptide growth factors that regulate a
diverse spectrum of biological processes [1]. The TGF-β
superfamily consists of over 50 structurally related
ligands, many of which are categorized into three major
subfamilies: TGF-β, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)
and activin/inhibin. Three TGF-β isoforms are known in
mammals (TGF-β1, -β2, -β3) [2-7] and in birds (TGF-β2,

-β3 and -β4) [8-11], and two in amphibians (TGF-β2,
TGF-β5) [12,13].
Preliminary results from our laboratory showed expression of a TGF-β-like transcript in a marine fish, the gilthead sea bream Sparus aurata during early larval
development [14,15]. The partial cloned fragment
showed high similarity to chicken and mammalian TGFβ3. In recent years, evidence has accumulated suggesting
the presence of at least three types of TGF-β in fish.
Based on homologies with mammalian TGF-βs, it was
suggested that TGF-β1 is present in rainbow trout, goldfish, carp, hybrid striped bass, plaice, gilthead sea bream
and zebrafish [16-23]. TGF-β2 has been found in the
carp, zebrafish and plaice [20,24,25]. TGF-β3 (partial
sequence) was identified in Siberian sturgeon, rainbow

trout, European eel and plaice [20,26] and in zebrafish
[27]. The identification of fish TGF-β2 is somewhat confusing. First, two Genbank entries appeared for zebrafish
TGF-β2, having 72% identity in the amino acid sequence
of the mature TGF-β. Second, carp mature TGF-β2 is
reported to be highly similar (93% identity) to human
TGF-β2 [24].
TGF-β isoforms have overlapping biological actions
and play critical roles during development, soft tissue
repair, bone remodeling, inflammation and carcinogenesis. These isoforms are widely expressed and play a role
during amphibian, avian and mammalian development
[12,28,29]. Skeletal muscle regeneration and development
are influenced by signal transduction pathways initiated
by growth factors such as TGF-β, insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), and fibroblast growth factors. Major advance
had been made in understanding the role of TGF-β and
its closely related family member, myostatin (MSTN), in
skeletal muscle ontogeny and postnatal physiology
[reviewed in [30]]. Skeletal muscle express all three mammalian TGF-β isoforms (-β1, -β2 and -β3) [31,32]. In
vitro, TGF-β1 mRNA is reduced while TGF-β2 and TGFβ3 are increased after differentiation (fusion) of the myoblast cell line C2C12 [31]. Others have shown that TGF-β
inhibits muscle differentiation through functional repression of myogenic transcription factors by the TGF-β
intracellular effector Smad3 [33]. Recently, the effects of
TGF-β1, -β2 and -β3 on proliferation and differentiation
of skeletal muscle myoblasts were compared using the
C2C12 cell line and it was shown that all three TGF-β isoforms delay myoblast differentiation while increasing cellular proliferation [34]. TGF-β1 has been also implicated
in muscle fibrosis following muscle injury [[35] and references therein].
Research on TGF-β in fish has been limited to its
involvement in the immune system [23,36-38] and in
reproduction [21,39,40], but no information is available
to date (to our knowledge) on the possible involvement of
TGF-β in fish muscle growth, which in fish that attain
large body size is unique. In contrast to mammals and
birds, fish skeletal muscles grow significantly after
embryogenesis in post-larval life through continuous
hyperplasia and hypertrophy (giving rise to the characteristic 'mosaic' of small- and large-diameter fibres in the
white muscle), contributing to their large adult size [41].
To identify growth factors regulating muscle growth in
fish of agricultural value, we report here on the cloning of
a novel form of TGF-β from the gilthead sea bream
Sparus aurata that we named TGF-β6 (following TGF-β4
and -β5 in chicken and Xenopus, respectively), which is
expressed also in zebrafish, Tetraodon, Takifugu, medaka
and stickleback. This TGF-β is expressed in various tissues including muscle and undergoes induction in white

skeletal muscle following starvation, in a similar way to
another member of the TGF-β superfamily, MSTN.

Methods
Materials

Oligonucleotides were prepared by Sigma (Rehovot,
Israel) and The Midland Certified Reagent Company
(Midland, TX). Restriction and modifying enzymes were
purchased from Gibco BRL (Gaithersburg, MD, USA),
New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA, USA) and Promega
(Madison, WI, USA). T3, T7 and SP6 RNA polymerase
primers were purchased from Promega and from Sigma.
Radionucleotides were obtained from Amersham (Little
Chalfont, UK) and from Dupont NEN (Boston, MA,
USA).
Fish and Tissues

Staged larvae and embryos of S. aurata were obtained
from the National Center of Mariculture (Eilat, Israel)
and from The Salt Company, Atlit. Juvenile fish were
obtained from Kibbutz Ma'agan Michael, The Salt Company, Atlit and Mevo'ot-Yam School, Michmoret and kept
in 700-L tanks at IOLR, Haifa at ambient temperature
(20-25°C) in flow-through seawater and fed ad libitum.
Embryos, larvae and tissues removed from decapitated
fish were snap-frozen on dry ice and kept at -70°C until
RNA extraction.
For evaluating the effect of nutrition and growth hormone (GH) on gene expression, juvenile fish (mean body
weight 23 gr) were divided into 3 groups: (i) fasted for 5
days and then injected with PBS; (ii) fasted for 5 days and
then injected with recombinant S. aurata GH (saGH, 1
μg/gr body weight); (iii) fed 2% of their body weight. All
fish were sacrificed six hours after GH injection and
white muscle was removed and snap-frozen for RNA
extraction.
RNA isolation, RT-PCR and Northern blot

Total RNA was extracted from different tissues of a single
fish or pools of whole bodies of larvae and embryos by
the guanidinium thiocyanate-cesium chloride gradient
method, guanidinium-rapid method or by using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH),
depending on the experiment. Poly(A+) RNA was
obtained by affinity chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose columns (5 primeT3 prime, Inc, Boulder, CO).
RNA was separated by electrophoresis on 1% agarose
gels, transferred to nylon membrane and hybridized
essentially as described earlier [42]. Total RNA (10 μg) or
poly(A+)RNA (1.2 μg) were reverse-transcribed into
cDNA using oligo(dT)12-18 primer (500 ng) (Invitrogen,
Paisley, UK), oligo(dT)17-adaptor primer (1 μg) or random hexamers (200 ng), depending on the experiment,

and 200 units of Superscript II Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen).
Aliquots of 400-500 ng cDNA were used for PCR
amplification of TGF-β using 2.5 U of Taq Polymerase
(Sigma or New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol each of
TGF-11 and TGF-12 primers (list of primers and their
sequences are detailed in Additional file 1), which amplify
a fragment of 489 bp. To verify that the amplified fragment in the expression studies is indeed the novel cDNA
cloned in this study, fragments amplified from 7-day larval RNA and heart RNA were cloned and sequenced. An
identity was found between the sequences of the cloned
PCR fragments and the combined sequence obtained by
3'RACE and RI genomic fragment (see scheme in Fig. 1
for primers position and description of gene cloning
below), thus confirming the identity of the amplified fragment as being novel TGF-β. Amounts of RNA in the RTPCR reactions were controlled by amplification of β-actin
also, as described earlier [43]. PCR products were analyzed on 1-2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV illumination.
Conditions for PCR were optimized by using different

amounts of cDNA and different number of cycles to
ensure linearity. In some experiments transcripts of
growth and differentiation factor-11 (GDF-11) and myostatin-1 (MSTN-1) were amplified as well using gene-specific primers (see Additional file 1).
Densitometric analysis

Quantification of TGF-β, GDF-11, MSTN-1 and β-actin
gene expression was performed using LISCAP (1995)
Capture Application, version 1.0 and TINA version 2.07d
program for densitometric analysis. Significant differences were determined by Tukey test after ANOVA using
SPSS version 12.02 for Windows and Microsoft Excel
2000.
Cloning of S. aurata TGF-β cDNA and gene

Cloning of full-length S. aurata novel TGF-β (TGF-β6)
cDNA was performed using several steps as depicted in
Fig. 1. Initially, a 225 bp PCR fragment of TGF-β was
obtained by amplification of reverse-transcribed
poly(A+)RNA (1.2 μg) extracted from larvae aged 7 days
post-hatching [42,44] and degenerate oligomers designed

Figure 1 Schematic structure and cloning strategies of TGF-β6. TGF-β6 precursor contains a signal peptide (SP), an N-terminal peptide (prodomain) and a C-terminal mature peptide. Partial sea bream TGF-β6 cDNA sequence was initially obtained by using a pair of degenerate primers TGF1
and TGF2. The 3' end was obtained by 3'RACE using primers TGF7 and TGF8. Several genomic clones, containing exons 2-5 and part of exon 6, were
obtained as described in detail in the Methods section. The 5' end was obtained by 5' RACE using primers TGF15 and TGF16. For clarity the MSTN gene
and deduced protein have not been represented in their real proportions. Primers sequences are presented in Additional file 1.

on the basis of a conserved region of chicken TGF-β3 [8],
spanning amino acids 330-335 (TGF-1) and amino acids
399-404 (TGF-2). The sequences of all primers are
detailed in Additional file 1. Sequence analysis of the
amplified fragment revealed high similarity to chicken
TGF-β3. Based on the sequence obtained, several genespecific primers were synthesized as detailed in Additional file 1.
The 3' end of the cDNA was obtained using FirstChoice
RLM-RACE kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin,
TX, USA) according to the manufacturer instructions
using total RNA (1.3 μg) from 7-day larvae reverse-transcribed using 3'RACE-adapter (Additional file 1). Amplification by PCR was performed by two successive
reactions, using primers 3'RACE outer (Ambion) and
gene-specific TGF-8 and followed by amplification using
3'RACE inner primer (Ambion) and the gene-specific
primer TGF-7 (see scheme in Fig. 1). A fragment of about
400 bp was amplified, purified and cloned in pGEMTeasy. BLAST analysis of the deduced amino acid
sequence of the 3' end fragment revealed high homology
with two GenBank entries (accession number
XM_683088 and NM-194385), both annotated as
zebrafish TGF-β2.
Since repeated attempts to clone the 5' end of the
cDNA by 5' RACE method failed, most of the sequence
was obtained by amplification of genomic DNA, essentially as described recently for cloning S. aurata MLC2
promoter by a linker-mediated PCR method [45].
Genomic DNA that was digested by several restriction
enzymes: BamHI, EcoRI, EcoRV, HindIII, PstI, SacI,
SmaI, HincII, PvuII, SspI and HpaI and was modified by
T4 DNA polymerase to generate blunt ends, when
needed. Following ligation with a linker DNA (oligo1 and
oligo2), nested PCR was performed by gene walking
using two linker-specific primers (L1 and L2) and several
pairs of gene-specific primers, complementary to the 5'
end of the already cloned S. aurata TGF-β. These pairs
were: TGF-8R and TGF-5 to generate an amplified fragment from DNA digested with EcoRI, TGF-9 and TGF-10
to generate an amplified fragment from DNA digested
with HincII, TGF-13 and TGF-14 to generate a fragment
from DNA digested with SmaI, TGF-14 and TGF-15 to
generate an amplified fragment of DNA digested with
EcoRV (schematically illustrated in Fig. 1). The amplified
genomic PCR products were separated by agarose gel
electrophoresis. Fragments (as detailed above) in each
round were gel-purified, cloned in pGEM-Teasy and
sequenced. Over-lapping between the clones was verified
by Clustal analysis.
The 5' end of the cDNA, including the signal peptide
and 5' untranslated region were ultimately cloned by
using 5' RLM-RACE Protocol of The FirstChoice RLMRACE kit (Ambion) as recommended by the manufac-

turer, using total RNA (10 μg) from S. aurata 7-day larvae, 5'RACE adaptor (Ambion) and random decamers for
reverse transcription. Amplification by PCR was performed by two successive reactions, using primers
5'RACE outer (Ambion) and gene-specific TGF-15 followed by a second PCR using primers 5'RACE inner
(Ambion) and the gene-specific TGF-16 (see Fig. 1). The
1200 bp amplified fragment was gel-purified, cloned in
pGEM-Teasy and sequenced.
Sequence analysis

Similarity searches of the sequenced DNA fragments and
deduced amino acid sequence were done by BLASTN
and BLASTX using nr/nt database of NCBI http://
blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi[46]. A multiple-sequence
alignment was performed using ClustalX version 2.0.8
[47]. A neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree was constructed using Clustal X version 2.0.8 and MEGA version
4.0 [48]. Signal peptide length was predicted using SignalP 3.0 Server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/.
N-glycosylation sites were predicted using NetNGlyc 1.0
Server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NetNGlyc/. Chromosomal localization of TGF-β genes and synteny analysis were performed using Ensembl release 56 http://
www.ensembl.org/index.html[49].

Results
Characterization of S. aurata TGF-β cDNA and gene

Studies in mouse and chicken demonstrated TGF-β1, -β2,
-β3 and -β4 expression in early developmental stages;
hence, poly(A+)RNA isolated from 7-day larvae of S.
aurata was hybridized to mammalian TGF-β1, TGF-β2
and TGF-β3 cDNAs. Only mouse TGF-β3 detected a
transcript with an estimated size of 7-10 kb (data not
shown). In order to determine the most suitable developmental stage for cloning TGF-β, poly(A+)RNA prepared
from three different developmental stages (early
embryos, late embryos and 7-day larvae) was hybridized
with mouse TGF-β3 cDNA [50]. A transcript of the estimated size of 7-10 kb could be detected in early and late
embryos as well as in 7-day larvae (Fig. 2). The levels of
this mRNA transcript increased as development of the
fish progressed.
PCR with degenerate TGF-β primers yielded a fragment of the predicted size (225 bp) using RNA from 7day larvae. A BLAST analysis following cloning and
sequencing of this fragment revealed strong homology
with several vertebrate TGF-βs. The highest homology
was found with chicken TGF-β3 (76%). This sequence
was used to design primers in order to clone full-length
TGF-β cDNA. The strategy for cloning S. aurata TGF-β
sequences is presented schematically in Fig. 1 and
described in more detail in the Methods section. The

Figure 2 Northern blot analysis of fish RNA hybridized with
mouse TGF-β3 cDNA. Poly(A+)RNA (2.5 μg) extracted from S. aurata at
different developmental stages (early embryo, blastula/gastrula stage;
late embryos, shortly before hatching; 7d, larvae collected 7 days after
hatching) was hybridized to mouse TGF-β3 cDNA as described in
Methods. Ethidium bromide staining shows 18S and 26S rRNA as a
loading control.

ends of the cDNA were obtained by 3' RACE and 5'
RACE of RNA from 7-day larvae (Fig. 1).
The cDNA sequence reported herein and presented in
Fig. 3 had been submitted to GenBank database (Accession No. FJ966093). The cDNA is 2215 bp long and contains an open reading frame of 1260 bp, with a deduced
420 amino acid long preproTGF-β. The signal sequence
for secretion is predicted to be 23 residues; the prodomain is predicted to be 283 aa long and the carboxy-terminal mature TGF-β is 114 amino acid residues long as
illustrated schematically in Fig. 1. The prepropeptide
contains an RKKR proteolytic processing site in accordance with other members of the superfamily. The pro-

domain region of TGF-β precursor contains three
potential N-linked glycosylation sites (N-X-T/S), similar
to the two zebrafish TGF-β2, but is in contrast to S.
aurata TGF-β1, which has four such sites. The mature
TGF-β contains 7 cysteines common to other TGF-β
superfamily members; however, like other TGF-βs,
activins, GDF-8 (MSTN) and GDF-11, TGF-β6 contains
one extra pair of cysteine residues (Fig. 3). Additionally, S.
aurata TGF-β6 predicted mature peptide also displays
the characteristic cysteine knot signature (CXCX-STOP)
found in other species, as shown by the presence of a
STOP codon at the second position after the sixth knotforming cysteine. The first cysteine of the mature peptide
appears at position 9, as in Tetraodon nigroviridis, Takifugu rubripes, medaka (Oryzias latipes) and stickleback
(Gasterosteus aculeatus) but differs from other known
fish TGF-β sequences in which the first cysteine appears
in position 7 or 8 (Fig. 4). Within the 3' UTR, two potential polyadenylation signals are found: a distal one
AATAAA and a second site, ATTAAA, located 16 bp
upstream of a short polyadenylation sequence. The 5'
untranslated region obtained by 5'RACE was found to be
672 bp long and this is predicted to be the transcription
start site.
Alignment of the predicted mature bioactive peptide of
the new S. aurata TGF-β revealed a very high homology
of 93%, 93.9%, 96.5% and 98% amino acid identity with
annotated sequences from Fugu, Tetraodon, medaka and
stickleback, respectively. An identity of 86.8% was found
with one entry of zebrafish TGF-β2 but a lower (69.3%)
was found with a second zebrafish TGF-β2 entry (Fig. 4
and Table 1). Level of amino acid sequence identity with
mammalian and chicken TGF-β2 and TGF-β3 mature
peptide was similar (67.5-69.3%) (Table 1 and Fig. 4). In
contrast, a very low identity was seen upon comparison
with S. aurata TGF-β1 (45.6%) and zebrafish TGF-β3
(47.4%), supporting our conclusion that this TGF-β represents a novel TGF-β which was cloned also from
zebrafish (Accession number XM_683088), but mistakenly was identified as TGF-β2. We called this novel peptide TGF-β6 because it is not similar to TGF-β1, 2 or 3
from fish. Multi-sequence alignment by CLUSTAL of
deduced amino acid sequences of precursor TGF-β from
S. aurata, the two zebrafish TGF-β2 sequences and predicted novel TGF-β from Tetraodon, Fugu, medaka and
stickleback is presented in Fig. 4 and Table 2. A high
homology with these four sequences from fish with
reported genomes was retained and also with one of the
two zebrafish TGF-β2, confirming our suggestion that the
TGF-β that we have cloned is a novel TGF-β which is
unique to fish and is different from the three known isoforms of fish TGF-β. The mature novel TGF-β is 114 aa in
S. aurata, Tetraodon, Fugu, medaka and stickleback but

TGF-β3 formed three additional separate clusters (Fig. 5).
Full names and accession numbers used in this analysis
are detailed in Additional file 2.
Synteny analysis of the novel TGF-β6 in five teleost
genomes available to date revealed a conserved synteny
around this locus. A graphic view of the syntenic relationships in zebrafish, medaka, stickleback, Teraodon and
Fugu, is shown in Fig. 6 and the chromosomal location of
the different markers is shown in Fig. 7. No orthologues
were identified in tetrapode genomes, confirming our
conclusion that this is a novel fish TGF-β. However, few
of the markers used in our synteny analysis were identified on mouse Chr 19 but no TGF-β was found. The
mouse Chr 19 data is included in Fig. 6 (although the
scale is 3 mb in mouse compared to 500 kb in fish). TGFβ1 is on mouse Chr 1, TGF-β2 on Chr 7 and TGF-β3 on
Chr 12.
During cloning of the amino-terminus of S. aurata
TGF-β, several genomic fragments were obtained by
genome-walking strategy. This approach has proven to be

successful primarily due to the relatively short introns.
Exon-intron boundaries of S. aurata TGF-β6 were identified by sequence analysis of the PCR amplified genomic
DNA fragments and a comparison with known TGF-β
sequences using BLAST and CLUSTAL programs. Our
results revealed that S. aurata TGF-β6 gene is longer than
4 kb and consists of seven exons of 361, 164, 133, 111,
181, 154, and 156 bp in length. The exons are separated
by six introns of >643, 415, 93, 1250, 425 and >287 bp in
length. The gene structure is illustrated schematically in
Fig. 8. Exon 1 forms the largest exon, whereas exon 4 is
the smallest. The 23 amino acid signal peptide and 97
amino acids of the predicted propeptide are encoded by
exon 1. The remaining 186 amino acids of the predicted
propeptide are encoded by exons 2 to 5. The last 11
amino acids of exon 5 together with exons 6 and 7, code
for the predicted mature peptide (see Fig. 3).
The gene organization in terms of exon length is identical to that of Tetraodon, Fugu and medaka, followed by
zebrafish and stickleback. Among other vertebrates, the

Figure 5 Phylogenetic tree obtained by amino acid sequence comparison of different TGF-βs. The phylogenetic tree was constructed from a
single multiple alignment, using neighbor-joining method with Clustal X 2.0.8 and MEGA 4.0 tools. Numbers at the tree nodes represent percentage
bootstrap values after 1000 replicates. *denotes the cloned TGF-β from S. aurata in the current study. For each sequence, NCBI or Ensembl accession
number and species abbreviation are shown. Few fish species with only partial sequences available were included as well and are denoted by #. Full
scientific names of species abbreviations, common names and their respective accession numbers are detailed in Additional file 2.

gene structure is most similar to that of mouse and
chicken TGF-β2 genes (Table 3).
Tissue distribution and developmental expression of TGFβ6

Expression pattern of TGF-β6 in different tissues was
determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and normalized to the expression of β-actin. Densitometric analysis
of TGF-β6 expression relative to β-actin in various tissues
is shown in Fig. 9A. TGF-β6 was detected in all tissues
studied with highest levels found in skin and muscle, followed by brain, eye and pituitary, gonad, spleen, kidney,
gill filament, heart and pyloric caeca. Very low levels were
detected in liver. This analysis used tissues collected from
a single fish.
Ontogeny of TGF-β6 during S. aurata development
revealed presence of transcript as early as day one after
hatching. The levels of expression increased as development progressed. A representative gel of the first 4 days is
shown in Fig 9B. TGF-β6 transcripts could not be
detected during embryonic stages (data not shown). As a
control, expression of another member of the TGF-β
family (GDF-11) is included, which is high on early days
post-hatching and decreases progressively with age. The
levels of β-actin expression are included as well. Densitometric analysis of TGF-β6 and GDF-11 expression, rela-

tive to β-actin, during early post-hatching period, is
shown in Fig. 9C. TGF-β6 and GDF-11 displayed an
inverse pattern of expression: while TGF-β6 increased
gradually, that of GDF-11 was high and decreased gradually. The pattern of TGF-β6 expression during early posthatching period was verified by using four different preparations of RNA from pools of larvae. The mean of these
four determinations is shown in Fig. 9D.
Effect of food deprivation on TGF-β6 and MSTN expression
in S. aurata skeletal white muscle

Starvation of juvenile fish for 5 days resulted in 5-fold
increase in TGF-β6 transcript levels in skeletal white
muscle, compared to that in control fed fish. A similar
effect of food deprivation was observed with respect to
MSTN transcript levels, although the increase was only
2.6-fold. Injection of recombinant GH to fasted fish had
minor effects on this elevation, when gene expression levels were determined 5 hours after injection (Fig. 10A, B).

Discussion
In the present study, we have cloned and characterized
cDNA and gene encoding a novel TGF-β from the marine
fish S. aurata, which we named TGF-β6. The gene
encodes a preproTGF-β of 420 amino acid long precursor.
The signal sequence for secretion is predicted to be 23

residues; the prodomain is predicted to be 283 aa long
and the carboxy-terminal mature TGF-β is 114 amino
acid residues long. This novel TGF-β was identified in
genomes of five fish species: Tetraodon, Fugu, medaka,
stickleback and zebrafish, and in all but zebrafish the
mature peptide is 114 residues long. Most mature TGF-βs
have 112 residues, with the exception of chicken TGF-β4
mature peptide that contains 114 amino acids [10]. The
114 amino acids include nine conserved cysteines, eight
of which are known to form four intrachain disulfide
bonds and the ninth cysteine forming an interchain disulfide bond, resulting in a TGF-β dimer [51,52].
The precursor TGF-β6 contains three potential Nlinked glycosylation sites (N-X-T/S), similar to human
TGF-β1 and TGF-β2 [53] but differing from S. aurata
TGF-β1 that has four potential N-linked glycosylation
sites [22]. No RGD integrin binding site was found in the
novel S. aurata TGF-β, in contrast to several other TGFβs, including that of S. aurata TGF-β1 [22]. This site is
also absent in human TGF-β2 but is present in both
human TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 precursors [53]. Computer
prediction suggests that the cleavage site between the
leader sequence and the prodomain is between Gly23 and

Iso24, immediately in front of the INTC motif, in accordance with other TGF-β sequences in which the cleavage
site is typically predicted to be immediately in front of the
LSTC motif. Moreover, out of the ten residues in human
TGF-β3 found to be directly involved in binding to the
type II receptor: R25, K31, W32, H34, K37, Y90, Y91,
V92, G93, R94 [54], eight residues are conserved in S.
aurata mature TGF-β6.
The novel S. aurata TGF-β6 gene is organized in seven
exons and six introns, in accordance with several other
known TGF-β genes like human TGF-β1 and TGF-β3,
chicken TGF-β2 and TGF-β3, zebrafish TGF-β3 and
Xenopus TGF-β5 [27,53,55-58]. An exception is TGF-β1
from S. aurata which consists of 5 exons only [22]. So far,
only four teleost TGF-β genes have been characterized
(including the current study), although during our synteny analysis we identified the novel gene in genomes of
Tetraodon, Fugu, medaka, stickleback and zebrafish. The
new S. aurata TGF-β gene is more than 4.4 kb long (the
exact size could not be determined since the first and last
introns were not sequenced in full). The overall gene
organization of TGF-β6 in terms of exon length is conserved in all six novel fish genes and also similar to mouse

and chicken TGF-β2 genes [56], but differs substantially
from two of the fish genes reported: S. aurata TGF-β1
(with five exons) and rainbow trout TGF-β [16,22]. In
contrast, the organization of S. aurata TGF-β6 is similar
(but not identical) to that of zebrafish TGF-β3 [27]. The
most conserved exons among vertebrates including
zebrafish TGF-β3 and S. aurata TGF-β6 are exon 6 (154
bp) and exon 7 (156 bp). The two other fish TGF-β genes
that were reported appear to be organized in a completely
different way: S. aurata TGF-β1 has five exons and rainbow trout TGF-β gene has seven exons, but lacks vertebrate intron 2, resulting in exon 2 comprising of
vertebrate exon 2 and 3. It has instead a sixth new intron

splitting the seventh exon into two shorter exons, with a
similar length to that of S. aurata TGF-β1 [16,22]. In light
of our results regarding S. aurata TGF-β6 gene organization and that of zebrafish TGF-β3 [27] as well as the five
novel fish TGF-β6 genes from the database, it seems that
the conclusion that intron 2 of human, chicken and Xenopus TGF-β isoforms is not present in the teleost TGF-β
[22] is true only in these two TGF-β1 genes. Additional
fish TGF-β genes need to be cloned in order to resolve
this important issue. Interestingly, zebrafish predictedTGF-β2 gene has very long introns 1, 4, 5 and 6 (range
2,500-8,900 bp), while introns 2 and 3 are short (less than
200 bp). Zebrafish TGF-β3 gene also has very long

introns [27]. This contradicts an incorrect generalized
statement put forward that introns in lower vertebrates
are much smaller in size [22].
An extensive BLAST and CLUSTAL analyses and the
resulting phylogenetic tree that was generated showed
that the novel S. aurata TGF-β precursor is clustered
together with a zebrafish TGF-β identified mistakenly as
TGF-β2 (accession no. XP688180) and four additional
fish genes identified through synteny analysis: Tetraodon,
Fugu, medaka and stickleback. Other vertebrate TGF-βs
were clustered into main three groups: TGF-β1, TGF-β2,

and a cluster of TGF-β3. The synteny analysis indicated a
high conservation in the region of the novel gene between
the five fish genomes. The markers used in this synteny
analysis were found also in mouse but no TGF-β was
found in this region. Taken together, these results led us
to the conclusion that the TGF-β cloned in the current
study represents a novel TGF-β, unique to fish which we
named it TGF-β6. The percent identities of the mature
new peptide with mammalian and chicken TGF-β2 and
TGF-β3 were in the range of 67.5 to 69.3% while that with
the novel zebrafish TGF-β was 86.8% and with the four

novel S. aurata TGF-β precursor scored 89-92 with the
Tetraodon, Fugu, medaka and stickleback predicted TGFβ and 74 with novel zebrafish TGF-β while scores of 33,
46 and 51 were obtained for pairwise alignments with S.
aurata TGF-β1, zebrafish TGF-β2 and zebrafsih TGF-β3,
respectively. These comparisons reinforce our conclusion
that we have identified a new TGF-β isoform which is not
one of the already characterized fish TGF-β isoforms.
Human genes for TGF-β1, -β2 and -β3 map to chromosmes 19q3.1-13.3, 1q41 and 14q23-24, respectively [5961], and to chromosomes 7, 1 and 12 in the mouse

Figure 10 Effect of starvation on TGF-β6 gene expression in
white muscle. Juvenile fish were starved for 5 days and then injected

All fish were sacrificed six hours after injections. Total RNA from white
muscle of experimental fish was reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT)
and subjected to PCR amplification of TGF-β6. β-actin was used as a
control for equal amounts used in RT-PCR. Amplified products were

mosome 5 [57]. As discussed above, the zebrafish TGF-β
gene homologous to the novel S. aurata TGF-β gene is
localized on chromosome 14 and that of Tetraodon
homologous gene on chromosome 1. The chromosomal
localization of the TGF-β genes suggests that they have
become widely dispersed during their evolution. It had
been suggested [64] that the TGF-β family has evolved
from a series of gene duplications and the genes became
separated through chromosomal translocations.
The expression studies in the current report used a set
of primers that span introns 5 and 6, thus ensuring that
the amplified fragment by RT-PCR is the result of RNA
amplification and not genomic amplification. Expression
was found in all tissues studied with various levels of
expression. The broad tissue distribution of TGF-β6
shown here suggests that it may have a role in a variety of
tissues, and further studies should be carried out in order
to shed light on possible roles for TGF-β6 in various tissues in fish. Nevertheless, this wide pattern of distribution is consistent with a wide expression reported for
TGF-β1 in rainbow trout [17], S. aurata [22] and grass
carp [37]. It is noteworthy, however, that whereas no
expression was seen for TGF-β1 in S. aurata and grass
carp liver, consistent with our current study showing very
low expression of TGF-β6 in liver, rainbow trout liver
expressed TGF-β1. The semi-quantitative assay in grass
carp showed high expression of TGF-β1 in immune system-related organs: thymus, head kidney and spleen [37].
Skeletal muscle is a dynamic tissue that demonstrates
great plasticity in response to environmental and hormonal factors. Recent studies indicated that contractile
activity, nutrients, growth factors, and cytokines all contribute to determining muscle mass. Muscle responds not
only to endocrine hormones but also to the autocrine
production of growth factors and cytokines. Skeletal
muscle synthesizes anabolic growth factors such as IGF-I
and inhibitory cytokines such as TGF-βs and MSTN.
These self-regulating inputs in turn influence muscle
metabolism, including the use of nutrients such as glucose and amino acids.
The natural life cycle of many fish species includes seasonal cycles of low temperature coupled with restricted
food supply in the winter leading to reduced protein synthesis and slower growth. Although numerous laboratory
experiments in fish tested the effects of food deprivation
(starvation) and re-feeding on the expression of the GHIGF system and several muscle regulatory factors [65-70],
this is the first report on a possible involvement of TGF-β
in fish muscle growth as well as in the effect of food
deprivation. Following a 5-day period of starvation,
steady state levels of transcripts for both TGF-β6 and
MSTN increased in skeletal muscle, compared to fish fed
normally. The immediate cause for this increase in transcript levels in fish skeletal muscle in response to starva-

Funkenstein et al. BMC Molecular Biology 2010, 11:37

tion is not clear and more studies should be done in the
future. Nevertheless, a similar effect of increased expression levels of MSTN in skeletal muscle was reported after
a prolonged starvation of sea bass [69] and underfeeding
in sheep [71]. Since the IGF axis is nutritionally sensitive
in vivo and since IGFs, TGF-βs and MSTN are important
regulators of vertebrate muscle growth, we can speculate
that also in the starved fish in the current study an interaction exists between the IGF axis and TGF-β/MSTN,
resulting in elevated expression of TGF-β6 and MSTN in
skeletal muscle. One way for such an interaction might be
a cross-talk between the mediators or regulators of IGF-I
and MSTN, as IGF-I induces expression or activity of
myogenic regulatory factors like MyoD and myogenin
[72] and MSTN is a downstream target of MyoD [73].
Another explanation might be the known effect of starvation on lowering circulatory IGF-I and GH, resulting in
removing a possible inhibitory effect known to be exerted
by GH on skeletal MSTN levels in vivo and in vitro [74].
Moreover, IGFs suppressed expression of the myogenesis-inhibiting TGF-β in vitro [75]. Information on TGF-β
expression during fish ontogeny is available to date only
for TGF-β3 in the laboratory model, the zebrafish [27],
but not for other fish species or other TGF-β isoforms. In
the zebrafish, TGF-β3 was expressed at extremely low
levels in embryos from 64-cell (2 hpf ) stage up to the 10somite (14 hpf ) stage, with significant higher expression
observed only in the 18-somite (18 hpf ). These results
differ from our current study, in which we could not
detect TGF-β6 transcripts earlier than day of hatching
and then the levels were very low. A continuous increase
in expression was seen as development progressed. This
observation is not due to technical problems, since high
levels of GDF-11, a TGF-β superfamily member, were
found in S. aurata embryos aged 15-16 h and 30 h (data
not shown) and the levels of GDF-11 expression
decreased as development progressed from day 1 to day 4
post-hatching. For comparison with other vertebrates, in
chick embryos very low expression of TGF-β2 was
reported during first 6 days [76], while in the rat TGF-β2
expression was high in skeletal muscle of embryonic day
14, decreased on postnatal day 3 and was negligible in
adult rat. A similar pattern of decrease was observed for
TGF-β2 peptide in skeletal muscle during postnatal
development [32,77].

Conclusion
A novel TGF-β isoform was cloned and characterized
from S. aurata and named TGF-β6. The deduced amino
acid of the precursor showed very high homology with
five entries in the database for Tetraodon, Fugu, medaka,
stickleback and zebrafish TGF-βs, but less identity with
other known vertebrate TGF-βs. The gene organization is
conserved among these fish species but also similar to

mouse and chicken TGF-β2 genes. Putative functional
sites have been recognized in the translated peptide and
in the nucleotide sequence. TGF-β6 transcripts are ubiquitously expressed with high expression seen in skeletal
muscle. It is developmentally regulated and is also
affected by nutritional state. The importance of TGF-β6
for skeletal muscle growth in fish needs to be further
investigated, and in particular, its response to food deprivation.
