Abstract
Background: Snake venoms are complex mixtures of pharmacologically active proteins and
peptides which belong to a small number of superfamilies. Global cataloguing of the venom
transcriptome facilitates the identification of new families of toxins as well as helps in understanding
the evolution of venom proteomes.
Results: We have constructed a cDNA library of the venom gland of a threatened rattlesnake (a
pitviper), Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii (Desert Massasauga), and sequenced 576 ESTs. Our results
demonstrate a high abundance of serine proteinase and metalloproteinase transcripts, indicating
that the disruption of hemostasis is a principle mechanism of action of the venom. In addition to
the transcripts encoding common venom proteins, we detected two varieties of low abundance
unique transcripts in the library; these encode for three-finger toxins and a novel toxin possibly
generated from the fusion of two genes. We also observed polyadenylated ribosomal RNAs in the
venom gland library, an interesting preliminary obsevation of this unusual phenomenon in a reptilian
system.
Conclusion: The three-finger toxins are characteristic of most elapid venoms but are rare in
viperid venoms. We detected several ESTs encoding this group of toxins in this study. We also
observed the presence of a transcript encoding a fused protein of two well-characterized toxins
(Kunitz/BPTI and Waprins), and this is the first report of this kind of fusion in a snake toxin
transcriptome. We propose that these new venom proteins may have ancillary functions for
envenomation. The presence of a fused toxin indicates that in addition to gene duplication and
accelerated evolution, exon shuffling or transcriptional splicing may also contribute to generating
the diversity of toxins and toxin isoforms observed among snake venoms. The detection of low
abundance toxins, as observed in this and other studies, indicates a greater compositional similarity
of venoms (though potency will differ) among advanced snakes than has been previously
recognized.

Background
The advanced snakes (superfamily Colubroidea) consist
of a monophyletic group of four families: Atractaspididae,
"Colubridae", Elapidae and Viperidae [1]. These snakes
have evolved biochemical weapon (toxins), rather than
mechanical means of handling prey. Phylogenetic studies
show that the venom gland (where toxins are produced)
evolved once at the base of the Colubroidea about 60–80
million years ago and has undergone extensive "evolutionary tinkering" of delivery systems and compositions
of venom [2,3]. Phylogenetic reconstruction between
toxin genes and snake families showed that the recruitment of toxin families into the venom gland has occurred
multiple times by both basal (e.g. metalloproteinases,
CRISP, Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors, NGF) and
independent (e.g. PLA2, natriuretic peptides) recruitment
events [4]. Approximately 26 families of toxins have been
catalogued in snake venom proteomes, and several families appear to be specific to a particular family of venomous snakes (Additional file 1). Sarafotoxins are found
only in venoms of Atractaspididae; serine proteinases
related to blood coagulation factors Xa, cobra venom factor, waprins and AVIT (prokineticin) family peptides
appear to be limited to the Elapidae; and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), disintegrins, waglerins,
dipeptidyl peptidase IV and crotamine occur primarily in
venoms of the Viperidae (Additional file 1). The occurrence, relative abundance and pharmacological potency
of various members of these toxin families in venom
make envenomation remarkably complex. Envenomation
by elapid snakes is usually characterized by rapid neurotoxic complications due to presence of large amounts of
postsynaptic neurotoxins [5], while envenomation by
viperid snakes evokes complex hemorrhagic, hypotensive
and inflammatory effects caused by the actions of numerous serine proteinases, metalloproteinases and C-type
lectins (CLP) [6-9]. Effects of envenomation by snakes in
the genus Atractaspis can include vasoconstriction, resulting in cardiac arrest [10]. Despite overall similarity in clinical symptoms exhibited after envenomation by members
of a particular family of snakes, there exists considerable
species-specific variation in absolute effects within each
group, contributing to the difficulty in assessing and treating envenomated victims.

ESTs. Using this approach, new toxin genes in known
families as well as several completely new families of toxins have been discovered, and the spectrum of snake toxin
proteome is gradually expanding [11-28]. To search for
novel and low abundance toxin genes or new families of
toxins, we constructed a cDNA library and sequenced ESTs
from the venom gland of Sistrurus catenatus edwardsii
(Desert Massasauga).
Sistrurus catenatus (Massasauga Rattlesnake) is a small pitviper broadly distributed across the North American prairies from Ontario, Canada and New York to extreme
southeastern Arizona, with an apparently disjunct population in northern Chihuahua, Mexico [29,30]. One subspecies, S. c. edwardsii (Desert Massasauga), occurs
primarily in arid and desert grasslands, occasionally
occurring in dune formations and desert scrub [31-33].
Populations of S. catenatus generally are threatened or
declining rangewide, primarily as a result of habitat loss
and human encroachment, and therefore endangered species status has been recommended [34,35]. In a systematic
study, Holycross and Mackessy [33] showed that among
Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico populations of S. c.
edwardsii, lizards are the major prey, followed by small
mammals and centipedes. In the present work, the venom
gland has been collected from snakes originating from the
Colorado population.
General symptoms of envenomation resulting from many
North American pitvipers bite are pain, local tissue effects
(progressive edema, erythema and necrosis) with coagulopathy (hypofibrinogenemia and prolongation of prothrombin time) and thrombocytopenia as systemic
effects. However, there is no specific report to date in the
literature concerning envenomation by S. c. edwardsii.
Profiling of toxin expression of this threatened snake species will give a global view for the expression of all genres
of toxins, including variation in coding/noncoding
sequences and their evolutionary trends. The results of
this study will also help in the understanding of envenomation processes of rattlesnake bites, which in turn will
be important for more effective clinical treatment and
antivenom management in cases of snakebite.

Results and Discussion
Previously, identification and characterization of venom
components relied primarily on various methods in protein chemistry or on cloning of individual genes. However, neither approach is well-suited to detect toxins that
are found in low abundance. Therefore, the apparent
absence of a particular family of toxins from venom could
be due either to their very low abundance or to the lack of
expression in the venom gland. The genes of low abundance toxins are best discovered by the construction of a
cDNA library and sequencing of a sizeable number of

A total of 518 out of 576 ESTs produced readable
sequences. The sizes of sequences showed a distribution
between 300 and 2000 base pairs, with an average of 800
base pairs (data not shown). A total of 232 clusters were
obtained and subsequently all clusters checked manually
(Table 1; Figures 1a and 1b and Additional files 2 and 3).
A large number of ESTs matched with snake toxins (360
ESTs in 76 clusters; 69.4%). Others code for cellular (nontoxin) proteins (107 ESTs in 106 clusters; 20.65%), and

The variations observed among toxin isoforms in this library are not due to population level diversity as they are derived from the venom gland of
a single snake

42 hypothetical ESTs (8.1%). Nine ESTs (1.7%) matched
with mitochondrial genes. Fifteen ESTs did not significantly match with any sequence available in non-redundant databases. Further, they do not have any ORFs and
may represent either long UTRs (3' or 5') or regulatory
RNAs and may have important functions in the rapidly
expressing gland tissues. The library contains a large portion of putative toxin genes (69.4%) compared to the cellular EST population (20.6%). We determined the
complete sequence of the longest EST of each cluster and
sequences were confirmed by repeated sequencing. We
completed the sequencing for all major toxins and two
low abundant toxin-like transcripts (described below).
The existence of genes of particular interest, especially singletons, was confirmed by RT-PCR, using a separate pool
of RNA that was used to make cDNA library as template,
followed by sequencing.

chondrial ribosomal RNAs are commonly used in the
classification of snakes [37]. Three ESTs for the 12S RNA
gene (DQ464268, Additional file 4) in our library show
100% identity to the reported S. c. edwardsii ribosomal
sequence (AF057227) [38], confirming the venom gland
used to make the library is of S. c. edwardsii origin. Interestingly, we observed that the ribosomal RNA sequence
has poly(A) tail and therefore they appeared in the cDNA
library. Polyadenylation of ribosomal RNA has been
observed in yeast (Candida albicans), fungus (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), protistan parasites (Leishmania braziliensis
and L. donovani) and human (Homo sapiens) cells, and it is
proposed to have a quality control role in rRNA degradation [39-42]. This is a preliminary report showing the possibility of polyadenylation of ribosomal RNA in a
reptilian system. On closer examination, we found a putative polyadenylation signal (AATAAA, Additional file 3)
[43] sequence six bases upstream of the poly(A) tail.

Confirmation of species
Taxonomic identification at the molecular level is essential to ensure species identity [36], and 12S and 16S mito-

Identification of toxin families
Serine proteinase
The serine proteinases in the venom gland library of S. c.
edwardsii are expressed with the highest transcript abundance (38% of 360 ESTs) (Figure 1a) and belong to 19
clusters. Multiple clones appeared in 12 clusters, while 7
were singletons (Additional file 2). One representative
EST from each cluster was completely sequenced
(DQ464238–DQ464248, DQ439973). One of the clusters (DQ439973) contains only 3'UTR (2 ESTs). This cluster shows 90% similarity with the 3'UTR of a serine
proteinase from Bothrops jararaca venom gland [44].

Most snake venom serine proteinases (SVSPs) to date are
single polypeptide chains, except for two fibrinolytic
enzymes from the venom of a Korean Viper, Agkistrodon
blomhoffi brevicaudus (brevinase, AJ243757 and salmonase, AF176679). In both cases, a single chain precursor is most likely cleaved by proteolysis [45]. In our
library, one cluster (DQ464244) shows 90% and 83%
sequence identity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels
respectively to salmonase. It is not clear whether or not it
is also processed to form a heterodimeric serine proteinase in S. c. edwardsii venom.
The SVSPs are found in all families of snakes and in general, they perturb the hemostatic mechanisms of prey.
They act on diverse protein substrates such as fibrinogen,
kininogen and platelet receptors [46,47]. Some SVSPs
exhibit more than one activity. For example, in addition
to their thrombin-like activity, bothrombin, crotalase and
LM-TL induce platelet aggregation, kinin release and gyratory activities, respectively [48-50]. We constructed a
neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree with 11 newly
identified SVSP isoforms from S. c. edwardsii, to assign
putative functions and to examine trends in the evolution
of new isoforms [47] (Figure 2). The phylogenetic tree
showed a scattered distribution of various isoforms with
different pharmacological activities from several species
of pitvipers. This pattern indicates that SVSPs diverged
after snake lineages speciated. Many SVSPs are commonly
considered as thrombin-like enzymes (TLEs) because they
mimic the fibrinogenolytic function of thrombin, promoting blood coagulation. Therefore, in most cases only
fibrinogenolytic function of SVSPs is tested and the SVSP
is categorized as a TLE. However, some thrombin-like
enzymes, in addition to releasing fibrinopeptide A and/or
B from fibrinogen, also activate protein C [51], complement C3 [52] and platelets [53]. Therefore, it would be
interesting to determine the specific pharmacological
properties of various SVSP isoforms within each group
and map these on their evolutionary relationships.
SVSP genes belong to a multigene family, and the proteincoding regions have been shown to be experiencing accel-

erated evolution within the venom glands of pitvipers
[54]. Such accelerated evolution could lead to the changes
in surface loops surrounding the substrate binding site,
resulting in the variation of substrate recognition and
hence, the function of the protein. The ratio between nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution (dN/dS) of the
protein coding sequences of serine proteinase isoforms of
this species was found to be 0.99, indicating a trend
toward accelerated evolution and therefore divergence in
pharmacological function during envenomation.
Metalloproteinase and Disintegrin
A total of 44 ESTs fall into 7 clusters and 7 singletons for
this family of proteins (12% transcript abundance) (Figure 1a, Additional file 2). One representative EST from
each cluster was sequenced (DQ464249–DQ464255).
Snake venom metalloproteinase (SVMP) precursors are
classified into four groups according to size and domain
composition: PI (metalloproteinase domain only); PII
(metalloproteinase and disintegrin domains); PIII (metalloproteinase, disintegrin and cysteine-rich domains); and
PIV (PIII type domains linked to a lectin-like domain by
disulfide bonds) [55]. None of the clusters encode PI type
SVMPs.

The PII isoform from S. c. edwardsii (DQ464254) matches
(83–85% identity at the protein level) with the precursors
of contortrostatin (Q9IAB0) and acostatin β chain
(Q805F6) from A. contortrix contortrix venom. Contortrostatin and acostatin are homodimeric and heterodimeric disintegrins, respectively [56,57]. The α chain
of acostatin is independently encoded and unlike other
disintegrins, it is not derived by proteolytic processing
[56]. However, we did not identify any ESTs matching the
α chain of acostatin. Phylogenetic analysis shows that
DQ464254 is closer to dimeric than monomeric disintegrins (Figure 3a). In the dimeric disintegrins, C246 and
C251 form disulfide bridges with the other subunit
[58,59]. However, in the monomeric disintegrins, C233
and C235 form disulfide bridges with C246 and C251, respectively, making them unavailable for dimerization (Figure
3b). Thus, characteristic Cys residues (C233 and C235) are
present in all monomeric disintegrins but are absent from
dimeric disintegrins [60]. The PII SVMP of S. c. edwardsii
(DQ464254) contains C233 and C235 in the disintegrin
domain and is likely the precursor of a monomeric disintegrin. Other monomeric disintegrins, barbourin and
tergeminin, were characterized previously from the
venom of S. miliarius barbouri and S. c. tergeminus, respectively [61].
The main integrin receptor binding motif of disintegrins,
RGD, is found to be at the tip of a flexible hairpin loop.
Variation of amino acid residues in this motif (R/K/M/W/
VGD, MLD, MVD or K/RTS) on the flexible loop confers

specificity towards specific receptors, e.g., replacement of
R with a K in RGD motif of barbourin and ussuristatin 2
significantly increases the selectivity for αIIbβ3 (fibrinogen
receptor) without affecting its binding to α5β1 (fibronectin receptor) or αvβ3 (vitronectin receptor) [62,63]. Additionally, the residues immediately adjacent to the RGD
loop also influence both selectivity and affinity for
integrin receptors [64,65]. For example, disintegrins with
RGDW and RGDNP have selectively higher affinity for
αIIbβ3 and αVβ3, respectively [63]. The RGDNP-containing
disintegrins are 10-fold more potent than RGDW-contain-

ing disintegrins in blocking the adhesion of cells mediated by α5β1. The putative disintegrin from S. c. edwardsii
has RGDNP, compared to RGDW and KGDW in tergeminin and barbourin, respectively. Therefore, further studies
of the physiological relevance of variation in receptor
selectivity among disintegrins from the same genus will be
very informative.
The PIII class of SVMPs are functionally more diverse: they
exhibit hemorrhagic activity, inflammatory effects, inhibition of platelet aggregation, apoptosis and prothrombin

activation [66-73]. All members of the PIII class of SVMPs
have six conserved Cys residues at positions 126, 166,
168, 173, 190 and 206 in their metalloproteinase
domain, and some isoforms have a seventh Cys residue at
three variable positions (195, 181 or 100) [60,74]. The
presence of the seventh Cys residue at position 195 (subgroup PIIIa) results in proteolysis/autolysis, producing a
product comprised of the disintegrin-like and cysteinerich domains (DC domain), whereas when it is present at
position 181 (subgroup PIIIb), the formation of a
homodimeric structure results [60]). We have not found
any isoform having a Cys residue at position 100 (103 in
our alignment, Additional file 5) in our library. Two isoforms (DQ464249 and DQ464255) from S. c. edwardsii
venom possess a seventh Cys residue in positions 195 and
181, and they can be grouped as PIIIa and PIIIb SVMPs,
respectively (Additional file 5). Two other isoforms
(DQ464250 and DQ464251) do not possess a seventh
Cys residue and hence cannot be grouped with any subgroups. Some other isoforms, such as HR1a [75,76] and
HF3 [68,77], also do not have the seventh Cys residue in
the metalloproteinase domain. We propose that these
metalloproteinases be grouped under PIII0 (suffix '0' to
indicate the absence of the seventh Cys residue) (Additional data file 5). The isoform DQ464253 is a partial segment and it cannot be assigned to any subgroup.
However, it shows identity with the A chain of a heterodimeric metalloproteinase identified in the venom of
Vipera lebetina which induces apoptosis in endothelial cell
lines [78]. Overall, the venom of S. c. edwardsii appears to
have significant molecular variation among metalloproteinases and their derived components.
Phospholipase A2
Interestingly, in our cDNA library only one cluster of PLA2
(DQ464264) was found, despite having the second highest transcript abundance (28%) (Additional file 2, Figure
1a). It matches with an acidic PLA2(AAS79430) of S. c.
tergeminus, with only one amino acid residue (nucleotide)
difference at position 80, P(CCG) → Q(CAG), in the
mature form. Thus there is no diversity of PLA2 in S. c.
edwardsii venom, though snake venom PLA2 is one of the
most rapidly evolving enzyme families. In most species,
several isoforms of PLA2 are observed in cDNA libraries
and venoms [79-81], and these have acquired diverse
physiological functions [82-84]. This observation is also
supported by proteomic analysis of S. c. edwardsii venom,
while venoms from individuals of other species of Sistrurus contain multiple PLA2 isoforms [85].
Phosphodiesterase
Sequence of a partial singleton EST (transcript abundance
0.28%; Additional file 2, Figure 1a) (DQ464266) shows
60% identity to the C-terminal region of the phosphodiesterase gene from chimpanzee (XP_001168685). This is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/115

the first cDNA sequence for a phosphodiesterase from
snake venom. Phosphodiesterase activity has been
observed in venoms of Elapidae, Viperidae and Colubridae snakes [86-88]; however, the role of this enzyme in
envenomation is not yet clear. Venom phosphodiesterases hydrolyze 5'-phosphodiester and pyrophosphate
bonds in nucleotides and nucleic acids and release 5'diphosphates, 5'-monophosphates and purines [89]. Free
purines are also present in snake venoms, and they may
contribute to envenomation sequelae [90].
L-amino acid oxidase
We obtained one cluster having 13 ESTs (transcript abundance 3.5%) (Additional file 2, Figure 1a). The complete
sequence (DQ464267) shows high sequence identity
(96%) with LAO of Crotalus adamanteus venom. LAOs are
widely found in snake venoms and in addition to catalyzing the oxidative deamination of amino acids, they affect
platelets, induce apoptosis and have hemorrhagic effects
[91].
C-type lectin
In our library, CLP account for approximately 1.4% abundance and have one cluster (DQ464256) and two singletons (DQ464257 and DQ464258) (Additional file 2,
Figure 1a). On BLASTP search, they match with the β subunit of mamushigin (Q9YI92; 80% identity), CHH-B
(P81509; 83% identity), and the A chain of Factor IX/Factor X binding protein (IX/X-bp) (2124381A; 86% identity) respectively. Mamushigin, CHH-B and IX/X-bp are
heterodimeric; however, in our library, we did not find
any match to ESTs encoding the corresponding complementary subunits. Therefore, it may be interesting to
examine the CLP-related proteins in this venom and
determine their biological properties.
Growth factors
We obtained one cluster (transcript abundance 7%)
encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
(Additional file 2, Figure 1a). Sequencing of 8 clones from
this cluster showed there are two isoforms (DQ464259
and DQ464260) with only two amino acid residue
(nucleotide) differences at positions 105, Q(CAG) →
E(GAG), and 114, K(AAG) → E(GAG). We also sequenced
a singleton (DQ464261) encoding nerve growth factor
(NGF). Another singleton (DQ464277) matched with the
C-terminus of connective tissue growth factor-related protein (CTGF). This is the first report of CTGF-related protein in a venom cDNA library. Its origin in the venom
gland, instead of other surrounding tissues, needs to be
verified.
Cysteine-rich secretory protein
We obtained one cluster (transcript abundance 7%)
(Additional file 2, Figure 1a) for a CRISP (DQ464263)

Page 7 of 17

BMC Molecular Biology 2007, 8:115

which matches with Catrin (AAO62995, 87% identity)
from C. atrox venom. CRISPs are widely distributed in
mammals, reptiles, amphibians, arthropods, nematodes,
cone snails and plants, and they exhibit diverse biological
functions [92]. They are single chain (MW of ~20–30
kDa), highly conserved proteins organized in three
domains: a PR-1 (Pathogenesis Related proteins of group
1) domain, a hinge domain and a cysteine-rich domain
(CRD). They contain 16 Cys residues forming eight conserved disulfide bonds. A few snake venom CRISPs have
been shown to act upon various ion channels through the
CRD domain [93-96]. However, the function of the
majority of CRISPs from snake venom is unknown [97].
Therefore, it may be interesting to examine the biological
properties of the CRISP found in S. c. edwardsii venom.
Bradykinin-potentiating peptide and C-type natriuretic peptide
We found a singleton (transcript abundance 0.28%; Additional file 2, Figure 1a) encoding a BPP-CNP (DQ464265)
which showed 80% identity with a BPP-CNP precursor
from Lachesis muta [98]. The BPP-CNP family of proteins
lowers the blood pressure of prey during envenomation.
Its low abundance in our library indicates that BPP-CNP
may not have a significant role in envenomation by Sistrurus, unlike bites by other pitvipers (Bothrops and Lachesis)
in Southern America [15,98].
Three-finger toxin like transcripts
We obtained three individual singletons (Additional file
2, Figure 1a) in the library (transcript abundance 0.83%)
which belong to the 3FTx family of proteins. As 3FTxs are
very uncommon in viperid venoms, using targeted
approach we performed RT-PCR using a separate pool of
RNA as template and sequenced 96 clones. We found a
total of five isoforms of 3FTx-like trancripts (DQ464281,
DQ464282, DQ464283, DQ464284 and DQ464285)
(Figure 4). They have a signal peptide followed by a
mature protein consisting of 64–68 residues. They appear
to belong to the non-conventional 3FTxs [99], with five

disulfide bridges, and the fifth disulfide bridge is in loop
1 (Figure 4). All isoforms have the potential N-glycosylation motif, N-X-T/S (Figure 4).
3FTxs were thought to be found only in elapid/
hydrophiid venoms, though the origin of recruitment to
the elapid/hydrophid venom proteome is not clear [100].
A polypeptide toxin (8 kDa) which crossreacts with αbungarotoxin and binds with high affinity to nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor (Kd of 7.3 × 10-10 M in competition
with α-bungarotoxin) was isolated from the venom of A.
halys (a pitviper) [101]. However, no sequence information of this protein is available. Recently, three clones
(DY403363, DY403848 and DY403174) were obtained
from a cDNA library of L. muta venom gland which potentially encode polypeptides similar to 3FTx fold proteins
[98]. However, only one clone (DY403363) has the start
and stop codons (complete ORF); the other two do not.
These sequences do not have any homology, at either the
nucleotide or protein levels, to those obtained from S. c.
edwardsii (this study).
Phylogenetic analysis of 3FTXs from three families of
snakes (Elapidae, Colubridae and Viperidae) was
achieved using PAUP 4.10b [102]. Trees obtained using
Neighbor Joining (bootstrapping) or Parsimony Analysis
(strict consensus, tree is not shown) were somewhat different, but major topological features were retained (Figure 5). One transcript from S. c. edwardsii (DQ464283)
does not cluster with the other four but falls within a separate clade containing Naja and Bungarus (both elapids)
3FTxs. Four other transcripts of S. c. edwardsii form a
monophyletic clade within an exclusively elapid clade.
Interestingly, both methods place L. muta (a viperid)
clones (DY403363 and DY403174) and Coelognathus
radiatus (a colubrid) 3FTx as basal to all other 3FTxs, suggesting a common origin followed by diversification of
3FTxs among all advanced snakes. Very similar trees, with
the same topology of family groups, were obtained using

This family of proteins was not observed in a detailed proteomic characterization of S. catenatus and S. miliarius barbouri venoms [14]. cDNA libraries of other viper venom
glands, including B. jararacussu, B. insularis, A. acutus and
Deinagkistrodon acutus, do not show their presence
[15,16,22,26]. This could be due to either low abundance
transcripts and proteins or non-uniform recruitment of
3FTx into the venom proteome within Viperidae. In S. c.
edwardsii, the low transcript abundance (0.83%) suggests
that 3FTx are minor components of the mature venom.

In snake venoms, 3FTXs exhibit diverse pharmacological
effects due to their ability to target various receptors and
ion channels [103]. It is important to note that the βsheeted loops play crucial roles in binding to various targets, and these regions are the most variable among S. c.
edwardsii 3FTXs. Further, the dN/dS ratio of 0.98 (close to
1) for their coding sequences indicates that a trend
towards accelerated evolution is present, as with the serine
proteinases. If the variations in the β sheet loop regions
are the result of positive selection (accelerated evolution),
they may exhibit distinct and novel biological activities.

Novel toxin-like transcript
In our library, we obtained one singleton (Additional file
2, Figure 1a) (DQ464286, transcript abundance 0.28%)
with an ORF encoding a signal peptide (24 residues) and
a mature protein (128 residues). The putative mature protein is rich in Cys residues, similar to many other snake
venom toxins. Its N-terminal domain matches with
Kunitz/BPTI toxins (53–68% identity) and the middle
domain matches with waprins (45–58% identity), and
the novel transcript has an extended C-terminus (Figure
6). Both Kunitz/BPTI [104] and waprins [105,106] are
found separately as single domain proteins in snake venoms. Two of the Cys residues, which form one of the four
disulfide bonds in waprins, are missing in the new transcript (Figure 6). RT-PCR using a fresh RNA (other than
used to make cDNA library) as template and sequencing
experiments show the presence of this fused transcript in
the venom gland and hence it is not an artifact due to template switching by the Reverse Transcriptase used for making the cDNA library [107-109]. Although a number of
cDNA sequences of Kunitz/BPTI from snake venoms have
been completed, none of them have the waprin domain
and the C-terminal extension. Currently, cDNA sequences
of waprins are not known. However, this is the first experimental evidence for the presence of a waprin domain
(though fused with another toxin) in viperid venom.

The longer ORF having Kunitz/BPTI and waprin domains
together could be due to the fusion of two individual
genes encoding Kunitz/BPTI and waprin. Gene fusion
mediated by exon shuffling (intron mediated recombination or retrotransposition) has been established as an
essential genetic mechanism for the origin of new genes in
invertebrates, vertebrates and plants [110,111]. Recently,
a new genetic process, transcription-induced chimerism
(TIC), in cases of tandemly located gene pairs has been
shown to be responsible for gene fusion in the human
genome, producing chimeric proteins [112,113]. It is not

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/115

clear at this stage how this novel fused gene has originated
in the snake venom gland. This fused transcript may code
either for a precursor which is processed to form two individual classes of venom proteins (Kunitz/BPTI and
waprin) or a novel toxin with two distinct domains and
having a new biological function. It has been observed
that new genes often give rise to new biological functions
driven by adaptive Darwinian selection [114-116]. The
mechanism of fusion of these apparently independent
genes, the evolutionary trajectory of this fused gene and
the potential new toxic function of the chimeric protein
are all areas for future investigation.
Iron-binding protein
Four ESTs (Additional file 2, Figure 1a) (dbEST:
SCEHYPO1, transcript abundance 1.11%) showed
homology with an iron-binding protein with a potential
signal peptide. Although most iron-binding proteins are
generally categorized as storage protein, some of them,
such as ovotransferrin and lactoferrin, have antimicrobial
activities [117-119]. It is not clear whether or not this protein is found in the venom. However, omwaprin, a member of the waprin protein family, and the C-terminal
region of a myotoxic PLA2 were both shown to have antimicrobial activity [105,120].
Identification of cellular transcripts
We obtained 106 clusters (transcript abundance 21%, 107
sequences) which are involved in various cellular functions, including transcription and translation, secretion,
post-translational modification, general metabolism and
other functions (Additional file 3, Figure 1b). Similar
house-keeping protein products have been observed in
other snake venom glands [13,15,22]. One of the ESTs
(SCE438) matches (74%) a calcium- and integrin-binding
protein which assists platelet spreading [121]. Although
modulation of platelet and integrin functions is a key
activity of several snake venom components, we do not

believe that this protein is present in venom, as it lacks the
signal peptide.
Overall, results from our cDNA library demonstrate extensive molecular diversity in the venom composition of S. c.
edwardsii. Serine proteinase and metalloproteinase isoforms are the most abundant components and in the
venom, they exert diverse pharmacological activities, particularly disrupting hemostasis. The numerous minor
components likely play an ancillary role in envenomation. These diverse toxin isoforms, together with minor
components, may be characteristic of venoms from species utilizing different prey types, such as lizards (ectotherms) and birds and mammals (endotherms) [122].
Venom composition and genetics of their origin
Snake venoms consist of a diverse range of pharmacologically active protein and peptide toxins which are primarily used in prey capture and secondarily as defense
weapons. To date, the majority of the work on toxin identification and characterization has been concentrated on
snakes of the families Elapidae and Viperidae because
they are often abundant, produce high yields of venom
and represent a significant risk to human health worldwide. Recent studies of venom transcriptomes and proteomes indicate that our knowledge of venom
composition is partly limited by experimental detectability. For example, 3FTxs, which were thought to be found
exclusively in elapid venoms, were detected in viperid
venom gland transcriptomes only recently [[98] and in
this study]. Similarly, CLP, thought to be limited to
viperid venoms, have been detected recently in the venom
gland of Philodryas olfersii (Colubridae) and Bungarus species (Elapidae) [27,106,123,124]. Further, a new family of
low abundance toxin (vespryns) was identified in both
elapid and viperid venoms [98,123], Therefore, with the
application of advanced techniques like EST sequencing,
"compositional specificities" between families of venomous snakes may become less distinct (Additional file 1).
Multiple recruitment events may lead to an increase in the
spectrum of known and unknown toxin families, decreasing the compositional specificities among venomous
snakes. However, differential contribution of specific toxins to the overall expressed proteome of venomous snakes
does lead to significant differences in venom composition
between species.

A central theme in the evolution of venom systems is complete duplication of toxin genes, followed by accelerated
evolution which favors nonsynonymous amino acid substitution towards neofunctionalization. Modification of
selected surface areas of toxins [82] is responsible for producing the functional diversity in animal (invertebrates:
snails and scorpions; vertebrates: snakes) toxin multigene
families [125]. However, one important observation in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/115

the present report is the occurrence of a novel toxin-like
transcript generated by fusion of two individual toxin
genes, Kunitz/BPTI and waprin, in a snake venom gland.
Though the mechanism for creation of this fused gene
needs to be studied further, it clearly indicates that other
genetic processes (gene shuffling or TIC) are also operating in the venom gland to create novel toxin genes. Genes
originating by other genetic processes such as exon shuffling are recent [111], and therefore the addition of this
fused toxin-like transcript to the venom proteome is perhaps new. At this stage, it is tempting to speculate that the
origin of modular organization of different classes of
SVMPs, which appears to be the result of gene fusion
events, may be due to a genetic process other than gene
duplication. SVMPs are very abundant toxins and carry
out a principal role in envenomation by viperid snakes,
and therefore studies of their genetic origin and organization will be of great interest. Circumstantial evidence of
trans-splicing for the generation of serine proteinase isoforms in the venom gland of V. lebetina has been presented [126]. Kopelman et al.[127] have shown that
alternative splicing and gene duplication are inversely correlated evolutionary mechanisms. According to Parra et al.
[113], only 4–5% of the tandem gene pairs in the human
genome can produce chimeric proteins. It is obvious that
these alternative genetic processes responsible for expanding functional proteomes are uncommon among biological systems, and it is therefore not surprising in our case to
have just a singleton of the fused transcript out of 576
ESTs (transcript abundance 0.28%). This also demonstrates that to detect rare genetic processes operating in the
venom gland, the library generated must be of high quality and that subsequent analyses must be performed very
carefully. In turn, these analyses help elucidate in detail
the principles of evolution of snake venom transcriptome
which have led to the evolutionary success of the
advanced snakes [128].

Conclusion
The composition of snake venoms has been shown to be
dependent on numerous factors, including phylogeny,
diet, age, geography and even sex [129-132]. In general,
greater similarity of venoms will be observed along broad
phylogenetic lines (e.g., within-family than between-family). However, as this study has demonstrated, some toxins classically considered to occur in only one family, such
as the 3FTxs, are actually broadly distributed among the
advanced snakes (Colubroidea). The present capacity to
detect low abundance toxins indicates a greater compositional similarity of venoms among advanced snakes than
has been previously recognized. Further, we have demonstrated that in addition to gene duplication, exon shuffling or transcriptional splicing may also contribute to
generating the diversity of toxins and toxin isoforms
observed among snake venoms. Overall, the elucidation

BMC Molecular Biology 2007, 8:115

of the venom gland transcriptome of S. c. edwardsii contributes to a broader picture of toxin expression which
complements and extends proteomic analysis of this
venom [85]. These approaches can lead to the identification of new toxins and provides mechanistic explanations
for their evolution and diversification. An unresolved
question involves the relationship between the venom
gland transcriptome and how this is ultimately translated
to the final proteome. This variable proteomic composition in turn determines the complex and often difficult to
resolve sequelae which frequently develop following
envenomation by the different species of venomous
snakes.

Methods
Venom extraction and collection of venom glands
Specimens of Sistrurus c. edwardsii (Desert Massasauga)
were collected in Lincoln County, Colorado, USA under
permits granted by the Colorado Division of Wildlife to
SPM (permits #0456, 06HP456). Venom was extracted
from adult snakes using standard manual methods [133];
venoms were then centrifuged to remove particulates, frozen and lyophilized. Prior to gland removal, snakes were
extracted of venom. Four days later, when mRNA levels
are presumed maximal [134], two snakes were anesthetized with isofluorane and then sacrificed by decapitation.
Glands were then rapidly dissected from the snakes, cut
into small pieces and placed in approximately 0.5 mL
RNAlater (Qiagen) and frozen at -80°C until used.
cDNA library construction and sequencing
Total RNA was extracted from a single venom gland using
the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The
integrity of total RNA was confirmed using agarose gel
electrophoresis. The mRNA was purified using an mRNA
isolation kit (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). The purified total mRNA was used to make the
cDNA library following the instructions of the SMART
cDNA library construction kit (Vector used: λ TriplEx2)
(Clontech, Mountain view, California, USA). Small size
and incomplete cDNAs were removed by passing the
library through CHROMA SPIN-400column. The library
was packaged using Gigapack gold packaging extract
(Stratagene, Cedar Creek, Texas, USA). Individual clones
were rescued from randomly selected white plaques and
grown in Luria broth + ampicillin medium. Plasmids were
purified using the QIAprep spin miniprep kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany). Purified plasmids were sequenced by
cycle sequencing reactions using the BigDye Terminator
v3.1 kit (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, California, USA)
and an automated DNA sequencer (Model 3100A,
Applied Biosystem, Foster City, California, USA).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/115

RT-PCR
RT-PCR was performed in order to search for isoforms of
3FTx sequences in the venom gland. In brief, total RNA
was isolated from venom glands as above and was used as
template. The following primers were used for amplification: forward primer, 5' ATGAAAACTCTGCTGNTGATCCTGGNG 3' (N = A/C/G/T); reverse primer, 5'
GGTTTATGGACCATCCTGTGGTAAAGGC 3'. Reverse
transcription and subsequent amplification reactions
were done using the one step RT-PCR protocol of Qiagen
(Hilden, Germany). The amplified product was cloned
into pDrive vector (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and 96
random clones were sequenced. RT-PCR was also performed to confirm the presence of fused toxin transcript
in the venom using same procedure with the following
primers: forward primer, 5' ATGTCTTCTGGAGGTCTTCTGCTG 3'; reverse primer, 5' TCCAG GACAGAAGAAGGCTCTGAT 3'.
Bioinformatic analysis
Clustering of the ESTs was performed using the CAP3 program [135] after removing poor quality sequences and
vector sequences using VecScreen from NCBI. We looked
for Sfi I (A & B) recognition sequences in the ESTs and
manually removed upstream and downstream sequences
of these sites as well as poly(A) tails (at least 10 A's in a
row) from the 3' ends. A minimum overlap of 50 bp and
100% identity in the overlap region were selected as criteria for the clustering. All clusters and singletons were subjected to BLAST searches (BLASTN and BLASTX as
required) against the non-redundant database of NCBI (evalues cutoff < 10-5 and having a good coverage of minimum 100 base pairs and >98% identity) for the putative
identification of the genes [136]. Presence of signal peptides was predicted individually by submission of the
sequences to the SignalP server as available in the Expasy
website. Gene and protein alignments were done using
the programs ClustalW and DNAMAN (Lynnon Corporation, Vaudreuil-Dorion, Quebec, Canada). The ratio
between nonsynonymous (dN) and synonymous substitution (dS) were calculated using the SNAP program [137].
The program SNAP has been developed based on the
method of [138] with incorporation of statistical analysis
developed by [139].
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the program
MEGA version 3.1[140], using Poisson-corrected distances, and trees were constructed applying bootstraps of
1000 replicates. PAUP 4.0b10 [102] was also used for
Bootstrap, Neighbor Joining and Parsimony analyses. For
the Bayesian inferences of phylogeny (based upon the
posterior probability distribution of the trees: Markov
chain Monte Carlo methods), MrBayes v3.1.2 [141] was
used. The analysis was run for 5 × 106 generations in four

Page 12 of 17

BMC Molecular Biology 2007, 8:115

chains and sampled every 100 generations, resulting in
50,000 sample trees. The log-likelihood score of each
saved tree was plotted against the number of generations
to determine the point at which the log-likelihood scores
of the analysis reached the asymptote. The posterior probabilities for the clades were established by constructing a
consensus tree of all trees generated after the completion
of the burn-in phase.
We included the following sequences from three families
of snakes in our analyses: the newly identified 3FTx
sequences out of this study from S. c. edwardsii (Viperidae)
DQ464282,
DQ464283,
[GenBank:

DQ464284 and DQ464285]; L. muta (Viperidae) [GenBank: DY403363, DY403174], α-colubritoxin [SwissProt: P83490] from Coelognathus radiatus (Colubridae),
and non-conventional 3FTx sequences [Swiss-Prot:
P81783, O42255 and P82935], 3FTx-like sequences
[Swiss-Prot: Q02454, P62375, P24778, P24777, P24776,
P01471, P62390, P01473, 229475, P01448, P01474,
Q8UUK0 and Z54231] [142] and 3TFx sequences [SwissProt: P10808, P01433, P01427, Q9YGC7, P10456,
Q9YHV0, P80958, P60772, P34076, P01419 and
P60237] from Elapidae. All these sequences belong to the
short chain 3FTx family. A BLASTP search using [GenBank: DY403174] from L. muta venom found that a rat
peptide sequence [GenBank: AAH63176] showed the
highest homology to Ly6 antigen, which has been proposed to be a potential ancestor of snake venom 3FTxs
[100,143], and this peptide was used as outgroup in our
analysis.
