Abstract
Background: The synaptic cell adhesion molecules, protocadherins, are a vertebrate innovation
that accompanied the emergence of the neural tube and the elaborate central nervous system. In
mammals, the protocadherins are encoded by three closely-linked clusters (α, β and γ) of tandem
genes and are hypothesized to provide a molecular code for specifying the remarkably-diverse
neural connections in the central nervous system. Like mammals, the coelacanth, a lobe-finned fish,
contains a single protocadherin locus, also arranged into α, β and γ clusters. Zebrafish, however,
possesses two protocadherin loci that contain more than twice the number of genes as the
coelacanth, but arranged only into α and γ clusters. To gain further insight into the evolutionary
history of protocadherin clusters, we have sequenced and analyzed protocadherin clusters from
the compact genome of the pufferfish, Fugu rubripes.
Results: Fugu contains two unlinked protocadherin loci, Pcdh1 and Pcdh2, that collectively consist
of at least 77 genes. The fugu Pcdh1 locus has been subject to extensive degeneration, resulting in
the complete loss of Pcdh1γ cluster. The fugu Pcdh genes have undergone lineage-specific regional
gene conversion processes that have resulted in a remarkable regional sequence homogenization
among paralogs in the same subcluster. Phylogenetic analyses show that most protocadherin genes
are orthologous between fugu and zebrafish either individually or as paralog groups. Based on the
inferred phylogenetic relationships of fugu and zebrafish genes, we have reconstructed the
evolutionary history of protocadherin clusters in the teleost fish lineage.
Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the exceptional evolutionary dynamism of protocadherin
genes in vertebrates in general, and in teleost fishes in particular. Besides the 'fish-specific' whole
genome duplication, the evolution of protocadherin genes in teleost fishes is influenced by lineagespecific gene losses, tandem gene duplications and regional sequence homogenization. The dynamic
protocadherin clusters might have led to the diversification of neural circuitry among teleosts, and
contributed to the behavioral and physiological diversity of teleosts.

Background
A long-standing mystery facing neurobiologists is the
molecular mechanism underlying the highly-diversified
neural network in vertebrate brains [1]. The discovery of
three closely-linked protocadherin (Pcdh) clusters in
mammalian genomes has led to an intriguing speculation
that these genes may provide a profound molecular code
for specifying neuron-neuron connections in the central
nervous system [2-4]. Each of the three clusters, designated Pcdh α, β, and γ clusters, contains different numbers
of large (~2.4 kb each) 'variable' exons. Each of these
exons encodes an extracellular domain comprising six
repeats of calcium-binding ectodomain (EC1-EC6), a
transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic segment. The 3' ends of the α and γ (but not the β) clusters
contain three 'constant' exons each, that are alternatively
spliced to individual variable exons in their respective
clusters. The constant exons encode the main part of the
cytoplasmic domain shared by all members in the same
cluster [2,3]. In many ways, this type of genomic organization resembles the immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor
gene loci, which are widely known for their ability to generate a remarkably diverse repertoire of antigen recognizing molecules. Pcdh genes are expressed mainly in the
neurons, and their proteins are highly enriched on synaptic membranes [2,5,6]. The transcription of Pcdh genes is
controlled by individual promoters located adjacent to
each variable exon [7,8], which contribute to the differential expression patterns of individual Pcdh genes in the
central nervous system [5]. The Pcdh genes also appear to
be under a higher order of complex regulation since their
expression seems to be allele-selective [9], and individual
neurons, even of the same kind, express an overlapping
but distinct combination of Pcdh genes [7,8]. More
recently, two long-range cis-regulatory elements in Pcdhα
cluster have been identified and proposed to underlie the
monoallelic expression of the Pcdh genes [10]. Taken
together, these features of Pcdh genes indeed suggest that
they have the potential to play a fundamental role in
establishing neural diversity in the brain.
The Pcdh clusters are essentially a vertebrate innovation
that accompanied the emergence of the neural tube and
the elaborate central nervous system. No such Pcdh cluster
has been identified in invertebrate genomes [11]. Mammals contain a single Pcdh locus consisting of about 60
genes [3,6,12-15]. The lobe-finned fish, coelacanth, which
is believed to be a forerunner of tetrapods, also contains a
single Pcdh locus organized into α, β, and γ clusters similar
to mammals, with a total of 49 genes [16]. In contrast, the
teleost fish, zebrafish, contains two unlinked Pcdh loci
(DrPcdh1 and DrPcdh2), presumably due to the 'fish-specific' genome duplication [17,18]. The zebrafish genes in
each locus are organized into only α and γ clusters. The
two loci collectively contain at least 107 genes. The mas-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/49

sive expansion of Pcdh genes in zebrafish has been attributed to lineage-specific expansion of individual genes in
some Pcdh clusters [19,20]. Interestingly, the zebrafish
Pcdh genes have experienced concerted evolution through
adaptive selection and gene conversion [20]. Thus, the
structure and organization of Pcdh clusters in zebrafish is
quite divergent from that in lobe-finned fish and mammals. It has been speculated that the differences in the
complement of Pcdhs in zebrafish and mammals could be
related to the anatomical differences of their brains [20].
However, it is not known whether the organization of
Pcdh clusters in zebrafish is typical of all teleost fishes or
unique to the zebrafish lineage. Teleosts are the largest
and most successful group of vertebrates. The extant teleosts include almost the same number of species as all
other living vertebrate species combined. Teleost fishes
also exhibit wide diversity in their habitat, morphology,
behavior, physiology and adaptations [21]. Given the
possible function of protocadherins in the formation of
neural complexity, it would be of interest to characterize
Pcdh clusters from diverse groups of teleost fishes.
In this study, we report the sequencing and comparative
analysis of Pcdh clusters in the pufferfish, Fugu rubripes.
Pufferfishes are unique in having the smallest genome
among vertebrates. The reduction in the genome size of
pufferfish is attributed to a paucity of repetitive sequences
and short intergenic regions and introns. At 400 Mb, the
fugu genome is one-eighth the human genome and onequarter the size of the zebrafish genome. A 'draft'
sequence of the fugu genome was completed in 2002
purely by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy
[22]. However, we found that most of Pcdh genes were
misassembled in the 'draft' genome sequence, most likely
due to the presence of a highly similar 3' region (identity
>99% across about 750 bp) shared by all the variable
exons in the same paralog subcluster (see Results and discussion below). We therefore sequenced overlapping cosmid and BAC clones and meticulously assembled the
complete sequence for the Pcdh loci. Our results show that
there are two unlinked Pcdh loci in fugu, similar to
zebrafish, and they contain at least 77 genes. The Pcdh1
locus in fugu has undergone an extensive degeneration,
resulting in the complete loss of the γ cluster. Based on the
inferred evolutionary relationships of fugu and zebrafish
Pcdh genes, we were able to reconstruct the two Pcdh loci
in the common ancestor of fugu and zebrafish and the
ancestral single Pcdh locus in the teleost fish lineage prior
to the 'fish-specific' whole-genome duplication. Our data
indicate that Pcdh clusters in teleost fishes have undergone
extensive diversification largely through lineage-specific
degeneration, tandem gene duplication, and gene conversion.

Results and discussion
Two unlinked protocadherin loci in fugu
We searched the fugu 'draft' genome assembly for scaffolds containing Pcdh genes by TBLASTN using the human
Pcdh protein sequences as the query. Altogether we identified about 70 scaffolds with high similarity (p value < 1010) to Pcdh sequences. A closer inspection of the scaffold
sequences showed that most of them were either misassembled Pcdh cluster sequences, due to the presence of a
stretch of nearly identical sequences across about 750 bp
shared by multiple Pcdh variable exons, or contained nonclustering Pcdh genes. Only three scaffolds (scaffold_6,
scaffold_160 and scaffold_480) contain reliably-assembled sequences equivalent to the Pcdh constant regions.
Detailed examination of scaffold_6 (~3.4 Mb long)
revealed that this scaffold contains a small Pcdhα cluster,
consisting of three variable exons followed by three constant exons, but no Pcdhγ genes (Fig 1). These genes are
flanked by several non-Pcdh genes, indicating that this is a
complete Pcdh locus (Fig 1). To verify this, we have identified three overlapping cosmid clones that span this
region (Fig 1). The sizes of these cosmid clones, as inferred
by mapping their end sequences to scaffold_6 sequence,
range from 40.2 to 48.7 kb. These are typical sizes of cosmid clones and thus indicate that there are no large scale
deletions or insertions at the Pcdh locus on the assembled
scaffold_6 sequence. To confirm this, we analyzed cosmid
clone c112D15, whose sequence spans the entire Pcdh1
locus, by restriction mapping using three enzymes (EcoRI,
HindIII and EcoRV) and found that it contains 46 kb
insert and its restriction map exactly matches that predicted from scaffold_6 sequences (data not shown). This
confirms that the Pcdh cluster on scaffold_6 represents a
complete fugu Pcdh locus, and contains only three Pcdhα
genes and no Pcdhγ genes. Phylogenetic analyses of the
variable (see below) and constant (data not shown) exons
showed that these genes are orthologous to zebrafish
DrPcdh1α genes. We thus designated this Pcdh locus as
FrPcdh1 (Fig 1). We filled gaps in the Pcdh constant region
in scaffold_480 and scaffold_160 by PCR using fugu
genomic DNA as a template and extended the sequences
by identifying and sequencing overlapping cosmid or
BAC clones (see Methods). This approach resulted in two
contiguous sequences of length 331 kb and 86 kb.

The larger contig includes a complete Pcdhα cluster containing 37 variable exons and three constant exons, followed by the first 23 variable exons of a Pcdhγ cluster (Fig
1). We identified three non-Pcdh genes, fEtf1, fFbxw11 and
fFgf18 upstream of the Pcdhα cluster indicating that the α
cluster on this contig is complete (Fig 1). The shorter contig contains 14 variable exons and three constant exons of
a Pcdhγ cluster, followed by two non-Pcdh genes, fDiaph1
and fTrpc7 (Fig 1). RT-PCR with forward primers corresponding to variable exons of the Pcdhγ cluster of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/49

larger contig and a reverse primer for the constant region
of Pcdhγ in the shorter contig (data not shown) showed
that the two contigs belong to the same locus. We designate this locus as FrPcdh2 locus (Fig 1). We were unable to
fill the gap between the two contigs due to the lack of a
genomic clone spanning the two contigs. Attempts to fill
the gap by long-template PCR using fugu genomic DNA as
a template also failed, presumably due to the large size of
the gap between the two contigs. The FrPcdh2 locus contains 37 α variable exons and at least 37 γ variable exons.
The exons downstream of the gap have been numbered
with a prime sign (24' to 37') to indicate that the numbers
may not represent their actual positions in the cluster.
Thus, fugu possesses two unlinked Pcdh loci, Pcdh1 and
Pcdh2.
The two Pcdh loci in fugu apparently resulted from segmental duplication from an ancestral Pcdh cluster. Phylogenetic analyses using constant (data not shown) and
variable (see below) regions of fugu and zebrafish Pcdh
genes show that the two Pcdh loci in fugu are orthologous
to the duplicate zebrafish Pcdh loci, respectively, indicating that the locus duplication took place before the divergence of the two lineages. This duplication is most likely
the result of the "fish-specific' whole genome duplication
event that occurred early during the evolution of rayfinned fishes [17,18]. Like the two zebrafish Pcdh loci,
both fugu Pcdh loci lack β cluster genes. The presence of a
β cluster in the lobe-finned fish and tetrapods, and its
absence in fugu and zebrafish suggest that the β cluster
either evolved in the lineage that led to the lobe-finned
fish and tetrapods, or was already present in the common
ancestor of these vertebrates and was subsequently lost in
the teleost lineage before the divergence of the fugu and
zebrafish lineages.
The two Pcdh loci in the fugu and zebrafish show significant differences in their gene content and organization.
For instance, FrPcdh1 cluster is highly degenerate compared to the zebrafish Pcdh1; as a result, it contains only
three α genes compared to ten α genes in zebrafish Pcdh1
cluster [12,19,20]. More strikingly, the fugu Pcdh1 locus
completely lacks a γ cluster (Fig 1), whereas the zebrafish
Pcdh1 locus contains a γ cluster with at least 28 genes
[12,19,20]. Thus, unlike the zebrafish genome which contains two Pcdhγ clusters, fugu genome contains a single
Pcdhγ cluster that is located in the Pcdh2 locus. The wholegenome sequence of a second pufferfish, Tetraodon nigroviridis, has recently been completed [23]. To determine
whether Tetraodon contains a single Pcdhγ cluster like the
fugu, we performed a BLASTX search of the Tetraodon
genome database and discovered that Tetraodon also contains two sets of α constant exons belonging to two putative Pcdh clusters but only a single set of γ constant exons
similar to fugu. Thus the second copy of Pcdhγ cluster

associated with the Pcdh1 locus seems to have been lost
before the divergence of the fugu and Tetraodon. The
highly degenerate nature of the Pcdh1 locus in pufferfishes
is consistent with the trend of pufferfish genome towards
compaction. The complete loss of the second copy of
Pcdhγ cluster in pufferfish suggests that these Pcdhγ genes
may be redundant. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the loss of this cluster in pufferfishes might
have an effect on their phenotype with regard to the structure and function of the central nervous system.
Phylogenetic relationships of fugu, zebrafish and
coelacanth protocadherin genes
The FrPcdh2 locus contains 37 α genes and at least 37 γ
genes, as compared to 38 α genes and at least 31 γ genes
in the zebrafish Pcdh2 locus [16,19,20]. In order to determine the phylogenetic relationships of these genes and to
trace the evolutionary history of Pcdh clusters in teleosts,
we performed phylogenetic analyses using the Neighborjoining method. We used only EC1-EC3 sequences,
instead of the entire ectodomain region (EC1-EC6) for the
analyses, because the C-terminal ectodomain (EC4-EC6)
of some fugu and zebrafish genes have undergone extensive regional sequence homogenization due to repeated

gene conversion events (see below), and using such
homogenized regions would bias the tree and the inferred
relationships. We first determined the relationships
among fugu Pcdh1 and Pcdh2 genes (Fig 2). The topology
of the gene tree shows that FrPcdh2α cluster is mainly
comprised of three major paralog groups, FrPcdh2α3–7,
FrPcdh2α8–25 and FrPcdh2α26–36. The three α genes in
the Pcdh1 cluster, FrPcdh1α1-α3, are the inter-locus paralog of FrPcdh2α1, α2 and α37 of the Pcdh2 locus, respectively. FrPcdh2γ cluster also consists of three large paralog
groups, FrPcdh2γ1–17, FrPcdh2γ19–32' and FrPcdh2γ 33'36'. In addition, Pcdhγ cluster also contains two individual
genes, FrPcdh2γ18 and FrPcdh2γ37', that seem to be distantly related to the other genes in the cluster, suggesting
they are generated from ancient gene duplications. Interestingly, FrPcdh2γ37' appears to be more closely related to
the FrPcdh1α3 and FrPcdh2α37 in the Pcdhα cluster (Fig
2). Notably, such a phylogenetic relationship between
Pcdhα and Pcdhγ clusters is also evident in mammalian
Pcdh clusters [3,12,13]. The two genes, c1 and c2, at the
end of mammalian Pcdhα cluster are shown to be evolutionarily closer to the last three genes, c3-c5, of the Pcdhγ
cluster than any other genes in the Pcdhα cluster [3]. Interestingly, phylogenetic analyses show that FrPcdh1α3,

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:49

FrPcdh2α37 and FrPcdh2γ37 indeed belong to the mammalian c1-c5 gene group (see below). The remarkable
conservation of these genes suggests that they may play an
important role in protocadherin functions in all vertebrates. The overall structure of fugu Pcdh cluster gene tree
is highly similar to that of zebrafish, which also contains
three large paralog groups each of Pcdhα and γ clusters
[12].
To explore the orthology of fugu and zebrafish Pcdh genes
and their phylogenetic relationships with Pcdh genes from
other vertebrate groups, we next performed phylogenetic
analyses of fugu and zebrafish Pcdh genes together with
Pcdh genes from coelacanth. Coelacanth was selected as a
representative of lobe-finned fish and tetrapod lineages
since the single Pcdh cluster in coelacanth is likely to be
the closest to the ancestral Pcdh locus of the two teleost
lineages. We analyzed Pcdhα (Fig 3a) and Pcdhγ (Fig 3b)
clusters separately.
As shown in Fig 3a, Pcdhα genes of fugu, zebrafish and
coelacanth comprise three large paralog/ortholog groups.
The first group (group I in Fig 3a) contains genes localized
at the two ends of fugu and zebrafish Pcdhα clusters,
including fugu FrPcdh1α1–3, FrPcdh2α1–7, FrPcdh2α37
and zebrafish DrPcdh1α1–2, DrPcdh1α10, DrPcdh2α1–7,
DrPcdh2α38, besides all but one of the genes
(LmPcdhα14) in the coelacanth Pcdhα cluster. These fugu
and zebrafish genes are further divided into four subgroups. The first subgroup (Ia in Fig 3a) consists of two
fugu inter-locus paralogs, FrPcdh1α1 and FrPcdh2α1,
zebrafish DrPcdh1α1 and LmPcdhα1. The second subgroup (Ib in Fig 3a) is comprised of two fugu inter-locus
paralogs, FrPcdh1α2, FrPcdh2α2 and their zebrafish
orthologs, DrPcdh1α2 and DrPcdh2α1. The third subgroup (Ic in Fig 3a) contains fugu FrPcdh1α3 and
FrPcdh2α37 and their zebrafish orthologs DrPcdh1α10
and DrPcdh2α38, as well as the coelacanth ortholog,
LmPcdha21. An interesting feature of these Pcdh genes is
that they seem to be resistant to gene duplication. In spite
of the heavy turnover of genes in their neighborhood (see
below), they have been conserved as single-copy genes
throughout the evolution of these vertebrates. This suggests that they may play a fundamental role in the central
nervous system. The fourth subgroup (Id in Fig 3a) contains fugu FrPcdh2α3–7 and zebrafish DrPcdh2α2–7. No
direct orthologous relationship can be identified between
individual genes in this subgroup; instead, FrPcdh2α3–7
as a paralog group seems to be orthologous to
DrPcdh2α5–7. This type of phylogenetic relationship indicates that subsequent to the divergence of the two species,
the ancestral paralogs have undergone independent lineage-specific gene duplications, giving rise to a multi-gene
paralog group in each species. This phylogenetic tree also
suggests that the subgroup Ia and Ic are derived from a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/49

common ancestor, while subgroup Ib and Id share a common ancestor. Except LmPcdhα1 and LmPcdhα21, other
coelacanth genes in this group do not show any direct
orthology to fugu and zebrafish genes, suggesting that
these genes are either specific to lobe-finned fish and
tetrapods or have been lost from the teleost fish lineage.
The second paralog/ortholog group (group II in Fig 3a) in
the Pcdhα phylogenetic tree comprises fugu FrPcdh2α26–
36, zebrafish DrPcdh1α3–9, DrPcdh2α26–37, and a single
coelacanth gene, LmPcdhα14. The subtrees of this group
show that a subset of genes in the zebrafish Pcdh1α locus,
the DrPcdh1α(3–5,7–8), are generated from an ancestral
paralog of DrPcdh1α6 through multiple gene duplication
events in the zebrafish lineage. No fugu ortholog for
zebrafish DrPcdh1α3-9 genes is found in FrPcdh1 locus,
presumably due to the independent loss of this paralog
group of genes in fugu. On the other hand, FrPcdh2α31–
35 appear to be derived from a single common ancestor
through lineage-specific duplications in fugu. A single
fugu gene, FrPcdh2α36, seems to share a common ancestor with a cluster of zebrafish genes, DrPcdh2α(27,31–36),
indicating that while the fugu gene was retained as singlecopy, the zebrafish gene has undergone multiple duplications. The fourth subset of genes in this paralog/ortholog
group consists of multiple fugu and zebrafish genes
including FrPcdh2α26–30, DrPcdh2α(26,28–30) and
DrPcdh1α9. However, the orthologous relationship
between these subsets of genes cannot be inferred with
confidence since the bootstrap values at their branch
nodes are rather low (< 200). As these paralog/ortholog
group genes are closely related and are clearly segregated
from other fugu and zebrafish Pcdh paralog/ortholog
group genes, we consider the whole group as one large
paralog/ortholog group. The evolution of such paralog/
ortholog groups is likely to have involved many rounds of
lineage-specific gene duplication and degeneration. It
appears that LmPcdhα14 is a distant ortholog of this group
(Fig 3a). Interestingly, this coelacanth gene also shares
common ancestry with the entire mammalian α cluster
(except the c1 and c2 genes) [16], suggesting that this paralog/ortholog group of fugu and zebrafish genes is perhaps orthologous to the entire mammalian Pcdhα cluster.
The third paralog/ortholog group of Pcdhα genes (group
III in Fig. 3a) seems to be teleost-specific, containing only
fugu FrPcdh2α8–25 and zebrafish DrPcdh2α8–25. These
genes can further be divided into three subgroups. The
first subgroup (IIIa in Fig 3a) contains fugu FrPcdh2α8
and its zebrafish ortholog DrPcdh2α8, whereas the other
two subgroups (IIIb and IIIc in Fig 3a) that contain multiple fugu and zebrafish paralogs do not exhibit any manifest individual orthologous relationships. However, it is
clear that fugu FrPcdh2α (15,18–25) and FrPcdh2α (9–
14,16–17) as paralog subgroups are orthologous to

zebrafish DrPcdh2α19–25 and DrPcdh2α9–18, respectively.
Similar to Pcdhα genes, the Pcdhγ genes also form three
large paralog/ortholog groups (Fig 3b). Orthology
between multi-gene groups (between a single gene and a

subset of genes and between two subsets of genes in two
species) seems also to be a common feature of the Pcdh1γ
cluster. For example, the fugu FrPcdh2γ32' (group II in Fig
3b) is apparently orthologous to the entire zebrafish paralog group DrPcdh2γ28–31, whereas the fugu FrPcdh2γ1–
17 (group I in Fig 3b) as a paralog group is orthologous to

a zebrafish DrPcdh2γ1–13. Additionally, orthology
between two individual genes from two species is also
observed in the Pcdhγ cluster. For instance, fugu
FrPcdh2γ18 (group I in Fig 3b) is clearly an ortholog of
zebrafish DrPcdh2γ14. Consistent with the previous study
[16], the phylogenetic tree for Pcdhγ cluster also revealed
that coelacanth Pcdhγ genes comprise five paralog groups
(group III in Fig 3b), of which four, LmPcdhγ(1,3–
4,7,9,19), LmPcdhγ11–16, LmPcdhγ(2,5,8,17–18,20) and
LmPcdhβ1–4 are closely related to each other, whereas the
fifth group, LmPcdhγ21–24, is more closely related to fugu
FrPcdh2γ37' and zebrafish DrPcdh1γ28 (Fig 3b). Such a
phylogenetic relationship suggests that a massive expansion of Pcdhγ genes has occurred in the coelacanth lineage
subsequent to the divergence of these species.
Orthology between an individual gene in one species and
a group of genes in another and between groups of genes
in two species rather than between individual genes is a
characteristic of multigene families which have experienced continuous events of lineage-specific gene duplications and losses. Pcdh cluster is a typical example of such
a dynamic cluster of genes in vertebrates. The Pcdh clusters
from fugu and zebrafish include instances of orthology
between a single fugu gene and a group of paralogous
zebrafish genes (e.g., FrPcdh2γ32' and DrPcdh2γ28–31)
and between entire paralog groups of fugu and zebrafish
genes (e.g., FrPcdh2γ1–17 and DrPcdh2γ1–13). These types
of phylogenetic relationships among Pcdh genes in fugu
and zebrafish illustrate the exceptionally dynamic evolutionary changes at the Pcdh loci in the teleost fish lineage
following the 'fish-specific' whole genome duplication
event. Although the single Pcdh cluster in mammals and
the coelacanth have experienced gene duplications and
losses, the extent of turnover is much lower than that in
the fugu and zebrafish. Such variations in the complement of Pcdh genes show that Pcdh clusters are much more
dynamic in teleost fishes than in mammals and lobefinned fishes. Since teleost fishes are the most species-rich
and most diverse group of vertebrates, it is likely that the
evolutionarily dynamic Pcdh clusters in teleosts might
have contributed to morphological and behavioral diversity of teleost fishes.
Regional gene conversion in fugu protocadherin locus
A striking feature of fugu Pcdh cluster genes observed during the assembly of cosmid and BAC sequences is the
highly similar 3' region of variable exons (identity >99%)
shared by multiple paralogs. These paralogs, which can be
differentiated by their divergent 5' sequences, are generally located at close proximity on the chromosome and
segregate into subclusters. We have identified three such
paralog subclusters in each of the fugu Pcdh2α
(FrPcdh2α2–7, FrPcdh2α8–25 and FrPcdh2α26–36) and
Pcdh2γ (FrPcdh2γ1–17, FrPcdh2γ19–32' and FrPcdh2γ33'-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/49

36') clusters, respectively. To investigate the extent of
sequence similarity and differences in the 5' and 3' regions
of these genes, we aligned protein and nucleotide
sequences of individual paralog subclusters and calculated their pair-wise amino acid and nucleotide sequence
identities based on the multiple alignment. While the
sequence identity of the less similar upstream region
ranges from 60 to 80% at both amino acid and nucleotide
levels, the 3' sequences are nearly 100% identical among
members in each subcluster (Table 1). The two distinct
regions are separated by a discrete boundary located at the
coding sequence for domains EC4 or EC5 in different subclusters (Table 1). Because purifying selection for protein
function does not act on synonymous sites, the astonishingly high sequence similarity at the nucleotide level is
thus unlikely to be due to a greater functional constraint
on the protein sequence. Instead, such homogenized
sequences could have arisen from repeated regional gene
conversion events. There is evidence that tandem gene
arrays tend to embark on gene conversion that leads to
sequence homogenization among paralogs [24]. Indeed,
zebrafish and human Pcdh paralogs have been shown to
have undergone frequent gene conversions, resulting in
substantial sequence homogenization among paralogs
[12,20,25]. However, gene conversions do not seem to be
an inherent characteristic of all Pcdh clusters, because no
gene conversion signatures have been uncovered at the
coelacanth Pcdh locus [16]. To determine whether the
high similarity regions shared by fugu paralogs are generated through gene conversion events, we compared the
GC content at codon third positions (GC3) between the 5'
low similarity and the 3' high similarity regions among
paralogs in each group. It is known that repeated gene
conversions usually cause an increase of GC3 in converted
regions [26,27]. The GC3 in 3' regions of all the paralog
groups is above 50%, and is significantly higher than that
for their corresponding 5' regions (Table 2), indicating
that these high similarity regions are indeed the result of
gene conversion events.
Pcdhs have been proposed to provide molecular diversities for neuron-neuron connections through the combinatorial interaction of protocadherin proteins. For classical
cadherins, the trans-homophilic interaction (i.e. the interaction between cells) is mainly mediated by the EC1
domain [28]. Although yet to be demonstrated experimentally, it is generally believed that Pcdhs also engage in
a similar form of homophilic interaction as the classic
cadherins. However, unlike classic cadherins which contain five ectodomains in their extracellular region, the
extracellular region of Pcdhs contains six ectodomains. It
is possible that the molecular diversifying signals of Pcdhs
in fugu are encoded by the extracellular EC1-EC3 domains
since this region is more divergent among individual
Pcdhs as compared to the highly homologous C-terminal

extracellular domains. This is consistent with the observation that the EC2 and EC3 domains of zebrafish and
mammalian Pcdhs seldom undergo sequence homogenization processes and thus provide the most diversifying
signals for the molecules [20]. Interestingly, it has been
shown recently that EC2 and EC3 of mammalian Pcdhs
undergo diversity-enhancing positive diversifying selection [12]. Collectively, these observations imply that the
N-terminal ectodomains of Pcdhs play a crucial role in
mediating neuronal connections in the brain. Furthermore, in contrast to the virtually 100% identical C-terminal sequences of paralogs in the same fugu subclusters,
the converted regions are highly divergent between subclusters. The consensus sequences for the converted
regions between different subclusters of Pcdh2α and
Pcdh2γ exhibit on average only 37.7% and 38.9% identities, respectively. This implies that the converted regions
in different subclusters may have undergone adaptive
selection and acquired diverse functions specific to each
subcluster. In contrast to fugu Pcdh2 cluster genes, the

Pcdh1 cluster genes do not contain any signature for gene
conversion.
Reconstruction of protocadherin clusters in ancestral fish
lineage
Based on the inferred phylogenetic relationships of fugu,
zebrafish and coelacanth Pcdh genes, we have reconstructed models of the duplicate teleost Pcdh clusters in
the common ancestor of fugu and zebrafish, and the single Pcdh cluster in the fish lineage prior to the 'fish-specific' whole genome duplication event (Fig 4). These
models illustrate the dynamic nature of the Pcdh locus in
vertebrates. The Pcdh loci in teleost fishes and the coelacanth have repeatedly experienced lineage-specific gene
losses and gene duplications. The lineage-specific tandem
gene duplication is rather dramatic in the Pcdh2 locus of
teleost fishes, giving rise to at least 74 and 69 genes in fugu
and zebrafish respectively, compared to 49 genes in the
coelacanth. According to our model, the single Pcdh cluster in the fish lineage prior to the whole genome duplica-

tion contained at least six Pcdhα paralog groups (αI to
αVI) and ten Pcdhγ paralog groups (γI to γX) (Fig 4). In
contrast, coelacanth Pcdh cluster contains orthologs for
only three of these fish Pcdhα genes and one of the fish
Pcdhγ genes. On the other hand, two of the coelacanth
Pcdhα paralog groups (Lmα2–13 and Lmα15–20) and one
Pcdh paralog group containing Lmβ1–4 and Lmγ1–20
have no apparent orthologs in the ancestral fish Pcdh cluster. These comparisons show that the Pcdh loci have been
subject to dynamic changes since the divergence of the
lobe-finned fish and ray-finned fish lineages and have
been continuously undergoing lineage-specific degeneration and tandem duplications. Characterization of Pcdh
cluster from a more basal vertebrate, such as a cartilaginous fish, should shed light on the ancestral state of Pcdh
cluster(s) and help to reconstruct the evolutionary
changes in the basal lobe-finned fishes and teleost fishes.

Conclusion
We have identified two unlinked fugu Pcdh loci that collectively contain at least 77 Pcdh genes. The gene content
of the two fugu Pcdh loci is quite different from that of the
two Pcdh loci in zebrafish. We show that following the
'fish-specific' whole-genome duplication, regional
sequence homogenization due to repeated lineage-specific gene conversion processes, secondary gene losses and
tandem gene duplications are the major factors affecting
the evolution of Pcdh clusters in teleosts. Based on phylogenetic analyses, we predict that there were at least six α
and ten γ genes (or paralog groups) in the Pcdh locus of
the ancestral fish genome prior to the whole-genome
duplication event. Elucidating the origin and evolutionary
dynamics of Pcdh clusters in different lineage of vertebrates is an important endeavor as it may help to uncover
the molecular code for the complex central nervous system of vertebrates.

Methods
Sequencing and assembly of fugu Pcdh loci
To identify fugu Pcdh sequences in the fugu 'draft'
genome, we performed TBLASTN search of fugu genome
database using human protocadherin protein sequences
as the query [22]. We identified about 70 scaffolds that
showed similarity to Pcdh protein with an E-value of 1010 or less. Detailed examination of these scaffolds showed
that most of the resulting scaffolds were misassembled
due to the high sequence homology shared by multiple
fugu Pcdh variable exons. Only three scaffolds, scaffold_6,
scaffold_480 and scaffold_160, were found to contain
large reliably-assembled sequences. Gaps within the relevant regions of these scaffolds were filled by PCR using
fugu genomic DNA as a template. Scaffold_6 contained a
complete Pcdh cluster flanked by non-Pcdh genes. We
identified three overlapping cosmid clones that cover the
Pcdh-containing region on scaffold_6. These include:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/49

c117N19, c112D15 and c5N15. For the other two scaffolds, scaffold_480 and scaffold_160, we used only the
reliable Pcdh-containing sequences as the anchor
sequence for identifying overlapping cosmid and BAC
clones by BLASTN search of the cosmid or BAC end databases [22]. We first attempted to sequence these cosmid
and BAC clones by shotgun method. However, since this
resulted in piling up of many variable exons, we resorted
to cloning and sequencing restriction enzyme-digested
fragments to obtain contiguous sequences. The protocol
for shotgun sequencing of cosmid and BAC clones comprised of shearing DNA by ultra-sonication followed by
end-filling by Klenow treatment. The blunt-ended DNA
fragments were resolved on an agarose gel and 2–3 kb
fragments were isolated and subcloned into the EcoRV site
of pBluescript SK vector. Plasmid inserts were sequenced
from both ends using T3 and T7 primers and BigDye Terminator technology (Applied Biosystem). Sequence reads
were then edited and assembled using SeqMan (Lasergene). The Pcdh variable exons and non-Pcdh genes were
annotated based on the results of BLASTX search of the
non-redundant protein database at NCBI [29] and GENSCAN predictions [30]. Sequences of fugu Pcdh clusters
generated in this study have been submitted to GenBank
under accession numbers DQ986917 and DQ986918.
Human orthologs of the fugu non-Pcdh genes were identified by BLAT search of the human genome database at
the UCSC genome browser [31].
Phylogenetic analyses
The genomic sequences of zebrafish and coelacanth Pcdh
clusters were retrieved from the GenBank [29]. The
zebrafish Pcdh clusters were assembled from sequences of
AC144826,
AC144828,
AC146480,
AC144823,
AB075928,
BX005294
and
AL929558,
BX957322[12,16,19,20], whereas the coelacanth Pcdh
clusters were assembled from sequences of AC150238,
AC150284 and AC150308-AC150310[16]. Variable
exons were identified by BLASTX searches. We used the Nterminal protocadherin ectodomain sequences (EC1EC3) for constructing phylogenetic trees as this region is
structurally homologous in all species, which gives rise to
few gaps in the alignment and does not undergo gene conversion. The sequences of EC1-EC3 from various species
were aligned by ClustalX algorithm [32]. Phylogenetic
trees were constructed by the Neighbor-joining method
based on sequence distance matrix, and the trees were
drawn using NJplot [33]. The robustness of the tree was
determined by bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicate sample sequences.
Analysis for third position GC content
We used CODEML program in PAML package with
default parameters to determine the GC content at thirdposition of codons [34]. The nucleotide sequence align-

zebrafish as well as the inter-locus paralogs between the two Pcdh loci in fugu or zebrafish are shown in the same colors. 'Teleost Pcdh1' and 'Teleost Pcdh2' are the Pcdh clusters predicted in the common ancestor of fugu and zebrafish, and 'Fish Pcdh ancestor' is the single Pcdh cluster predicted in the ray-finned fish prior to the 'fish-specific' whole genome duplication. The
corresponding exons in the 'Fish Pcdh ancestor' and the inter-locus paralogs between 'Teleost Pcdh1' and 'Teleost Pcdh2' are
