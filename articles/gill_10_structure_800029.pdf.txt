Abstract
Background: Nucleosome assembly proteins (NAPs) are histone chaperones that are crucial for the shuttling and
incorporation of histones into nucleosomes. NAPs participate in the assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes thus
contributing to chromatin structure organization. The human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum contains two
nucleosome assembly proteins termed PfNapL and PfNapS.
Methods: Three-dimensional crystal structure of PfNapS has been determined and analysed. Gene knockout and
localization studies were also performed on PfNapS using transfection studies. Fluorescence spectroscopy was
performed to identify histone-binding sites on PfNapS. Extensive sequence and structural comparisons were done
with the crystal structures available for NAP/SET family of proteins.
Results: Crystal structure of PfNapS shares structural similarity with previous structures from NAP/SET family. Failed
attempts to knock-out the gene for PfNapS from malaria parasite suggest essentiality in the parasite. GFP-fused PfNapS
fusion protein targeting indicates cellular localization of PfNapS in the parasite nucleus. Fluorescence spectroscopy
data suggest that PfNapS interacts with core histones (tetramer, octamer, H3, H4, H2A and H2B) at a different site from
its interaction with linker histone H1. This analysis illustrates two regions on the PfNapS dimer as the possible sites for
histone recognition.
Conclusions: This work presents a thorough analysis of the structural, functional and regulatory attributes of PfNapS
from P. falciparum with respect to previously studied histone chaperones.
Background
In eukaryotic cells, DNA is present in a highly compacted
form called chromatin. The repeating unit of chromatin
is the nucleosome, formed from two histone H2A-H2B
dimers and one histone H3-H4 tetramer around which
147 bp of DNA are wrapped [1]. Chromatin is highly
dynamic, a characteristic that is vital in regulating nuclear
processes such as transcription and replication which
require access to DNA. Processes that influence chromatin fluidity include post-translational modifications of
histones, incorporation of histone variants, and histone
exchange by dedicated histone chaperones [2,3]. Histone

chaperones are proteins that regulate the interaction of
histones with other proteins and DNA and also prevent
the highly basic histones from forming inappropriate
aggregates [2,3]. In addition to playing an important role
in histone exchange during nuclear processes, histone
chaperones function in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of
histones, in histone storage, in nucleosome assembly and
they act as a link between chromatin remodeling factors
and histones [2,3]. Many different histone chaperones
have been identified, including nucleoplasmin, Asf1
(anti-silencing function 1), HIRA proteins (Histone regulator A), Spt6 (Transcription elongation factor), ACF
(ATP utilizing chromatin assembly and remodelling factor), CAF1 (Chromatin assembly factor 1), and NAP1
(nucleosome assembly protein 1) [2,3].

Malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases
and remains an enormous public health problem. Malaria
is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium, and the most serious form of the disease is caused
by Plasmodium falciparum [4]. Thus, it is important to
understand the fundamental biological processes of P. falciparum, which may provide avenues for the identification of new protein targets for development of new antimalarials. The human malaria parasite P. falciparum contains two nucleosome assembly proteins, orthologs of
eukaryotic NAPs, which have been previously termed
PfNapL and PfNapS [5-8]. It has been previously shown
that both PfNapL and PfNapS are present in all erythrocytic stages of the parasite [5,6]. It has also been shown
earlier that PfNapS forms complexes with both histone
tetramer and octamer and is predominantly localized in
the nucleus in the asexual and sexual stages of the parasite [5,6]. PfNapL and PfNapS do not interact with each
other and unlike PfNapL, PfNapS is able to deposit histones onto DNA [6].
In the present study, the structural basis of nucleosome
assembly activity in P. falciparum was addressed by determining and analysing the crystal structure of smaller
NAP in the parasite called PfNapS. Data are presented on
the attempted gene knockout of PfNapS, its cellular localization and its histone binding properties. Attempts to
generate parasites lacking PfNapS gene were unsuccessful
indicating the likely essential nature of this gene for parasite survival. Using GFP-fused PfNapS deletion constructs, it is shown that PfNapS is most likely resident in
the parasite nucleus. Fluorescence spectroscopy data
indicate differential modes of PfNapS interaction with
core histones versus the linker histone. Finally, a thorough comparative analysis of PfNapS is presented with
structures of NAP/SET family proteins which include PfNapL, yeast NAP-1, yeast NAP Vps75 (vacuolar protein
sorting 75) and the functional domain of human SET/
TAF-1b(β)/INHAT [7-12]. These studies provide basis
for further exploration of nucleosome assembly as a relevant new target for development of anti-malarials.

Methods
Protein crystallization and data collection

Full length purified PfNapS protein (aa 1-269, molecular
weight ~32 kDa) failed to crystallize and thus a shorter
construct of PfNapS was produced containing residues
29-221. PfNapS seleno-met crystals were then successfully obtained at 20°C by hanging drop vapour diffusion
[13] using l μl of 3 mg/ml PfNapS and l μl of 0.2 M diammonium tartrate with 20% PEG 3350 (mother liquor).
A single crystal was soaked in a cryoprotectant containing higher concentration of mother liquor (30% PEG 3350
and 0.3 M di-ammonium tartrate) for 5 min and flashfrozen under a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K. X-ray dif-

fraction data were collected to 3.2 Å at BM14 beamline,
ESRF, Grenoble. The seleno-met crystals of PfNapS
belong to orthorhombic space group P212121 with cell
dimensions of a = 96.18, b = 116.84, c = 138.65 Å having 3
dimers in the asymmetric unit (ASU). High-resolution
native diffraction data to 2.8 Å resolution were collected
at BM14 beamline, ESRF, Grenoble. These crystals also
belong to orthorhombic space group P212121 with different cell dimensions of a = 95.79, b = 114.89, c = 139 Å.
The diffraction images were processed and scaled with
the HKL2000 suite [14].
Phasing, structure determination, refinement and analysis

The structure of PfNapS was determined using seleniumSAD technique and phasing was achieved by utilizing a
total of 24 selenomethonines (8 per dimer) in the ASU to
3.2 Å resolution using SHARP [15]. Only a partial initial
model was built without side-chains using PHENIX [16]
and this model was subsequently rebuilt manually using
COOT [17]. The higher resolution structure was determined by molecular replacement technique using PfNapS
seleno-met model. This model to 2.8 Å was refined using
CNS ([18], Table 1). Final model was validated using
PROCHECK [19]. All figures were generated using Chimera [20]. Least square fittings and structural alignment
were carried out using LSQMAN [21]. Protein localization predictions were done using LOCtree [22].
Generation of plasmids and transgenic P. falciparum cell
lines

Transgenic parasites expressing GFP chimeras were generated by cloning either the full length PfNapS coding
region or truncated portions of it into the pARL vector
[23], where expression of chimeric protein is under the
influence of the crt promoter. Each DNA construct was
confirmed by sequencing. 100 ug plasmid DNA (Qiagen)
was transfected by electroporation into P. falciparum 3D7
parasites which were cultured in the presence of 2 nM
WR99210 [24]. To generate a PFI0930c (PfNapS gene)
deletion construct 5' and 3' targeting sequences were
amplified using the primer pairs aw771/772 and aw773/
774 respectively. The amplified targeting sequences (613
bp and 530 bp) were cloned into pCC-1 vector [25] using
SacII/SpeI for the 5' and EcoRI/AvrII for the 3' segment,
resulting in the pCC-1ΔPfNapS plasmid.

The plasmid DNA was proliferated in Escherichia coli
PMC103 cells and purified with a Qiagen Maxit kit,
before 80 ug were taken up in cytomix and electroporated
into 3D7 P. falciparum infected human erythrocytes (O+)
using standard procedures [24]. Parasites were cultured

using standard conditions and parasites containing the
plasmid were selected in the presence of 2 nM WR99210
[26]. The resulting parasite population was then subjected to two off/on drug cycles for 21 days each to
encourage the loss of free plasmid. After each addition of
WR99210, a subpopulation was selected on 231 nM 5fluorocytosine in the presence of WR99210 (to encourage
double recombination events) and analysed via Southern
blot.
SDS-PAGE and western blotting

Parasite cultures were synchronized by sorbitol treatment
[27] and saponin pellets of trophozoite parasites were
prepared. The parasite-derived proteins were fractionated on a 10% Bis-Tris precast gel (Invitrogen) using
MOPS buffer. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.22 um, Millipore)
before western blot was performed using standard procedures. Antibodies used were mouse anti-GFP (1:1000,
Roche) and horseradish peroxidase-coupled sheep antimouse IgG (1:2000, Chemicon, Melbourne, Australia).
Protein bands on the western blots were visualized using
a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL, GE).
Microscopy

GFP-expressing infected erythrocytes were tightly synchronized using sorbitol and studied live at ambient temperature. Cells were viewed with a Plan-Neofluar 100×
1.3 oil objective on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M Live Cell
Imaging Inverted Microscope equipped with a AxioCam
MRm camera and primarily processed with AxioVision
4.4 deconvolution software package. Captured images
were then further processed using Photoshop and ImageJ
software [28]. Pictures were adjusted to gain optimal contrast to visualize features of interest.

Protein expression, purification, fluorescent labeling and
ELISA-based binding studies

All histones (purchased from Roche diagnostics) were
dissolved in autoclaved distilled water. PfNapS protein
was expressed and purified using standard protocols
described previously [5,6]. Site directed mutagenesis was
carried out using QuickChange® II Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit. PfNapS was labelled with 6-acryloyl-2-dimethyl-aminonaphthalene
(acrylodan)
dye
(from
Invitrogen) using the protocol described by Prendergast
et al [29] and Hibbs et al [30] with a few modifications.
Acrylodan dye is an extrinsic fluorophore and its fluorescence emission is highly sensitive to its local microenvironment when bound to the protein. It exhibits changes
in both intensity and emission wavelength that reflects
the effective dielectric constant of the microenvironment
around the fluorophore. PfNapS was labelled with the dye
using the protocol described by Prendergast et al [29] and
Hibbs et al [30]. Stock concentration of dye was prepared
in dimethyl formamide. Purified protein was incubated
with excess of dye in phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH = 7.5)
overnight in the dark at 4°C. Unbound dye was removed
using Superdex® 75 10/300 GL (GE healthcare). Binding of
labelled PfNapS with H3 and linker histone H1 was studied using similar protocols described previously [6].
Steady state fluorescence measurement

Steady state fluorescence measurement was taken on Perkin Elmer LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer. The
sample was titrated with histones H3, H4, H2A, H2B, histone tetramer { [(H3-H4)2]} and histone octamer (two
heterodimers of H2A-H2B and a tetramer of H3-H4).
Fluorescence of buffer was subtracted as control. Excitation was done at 360 nm and emission was scanned from
400 to 550 nm. Both the slits were 5 nm wide open and
the scan speed was set to 100 nm per minute. All fluores-

cence emission data are calculated as mean of at least two
replicate experiments.

Results and Discussion
Structure determination of PfNapS and structural
comparisons with PfNapL, hSET, yNAP-1 and Vps75

A construct of PfNapS consisting residues 29-221 (molecular weight ~23 kDa) crystallized in orthorhombic space
group P212121 with solvent content of 55% (the asymmetric unit contains three dimers of PfNapS). Crystal structure of PfNapS was determined using selenium-SAD
(single anomalous dispersion) technique at 3.2 Å and
refined using native data to 2.8 Å resolution (Table 1).
Most residues of PfNapS exhibited clear electron density.
Four C-terminal residues (aa 218-221) were disordered as
were regions 142-150 and 168-181. The final refined
model of PfNapS has Rfactor and Rfree values of 28.2% and
31.45% respectively (Table 1). The domain architecture
and the overall fold of PfNapS are similar to PfNapL,
yNAP-1, hSET and Vps75 [7-12] (Figure 1a-b, 2a-c).
Functional, cellular localization and sub-domain properties of these five structures are summarized in Table 2
and 3[6,7,31-33]. Each monomer of PfNapS contains
domain I comprised of dimerization helix α2 (aa 33-73).
The monomer also contains domain II, which is comprised of α-helices [α3 (aa 81-85), α4 (aa 99-102)] and a β
sub-domain containing 4 anti-parallel β-strands (aa 106158). The 4th β-strand in PfNapS is composed of a random coil similar to hSET. Finally, there are two α-helices
on the opposite side of the β sub-domain [α7 (aa 200-211
and α8 (aa 214-216)] (Figure 1b). It was observed that
each of the six chains of PfNapS in crystallographic asymmetric unit differ mainly in the orientation of their
dimerization helix α2 and the loop regions between the

β-strands in the β sub-domain suggesting possible points
of flexibility.
The PfNapS dimer has a characteristic shape and fold
previously seen for yNAP-1, Vps75, hSET and PfNapL
dimers (Figures 1a-b, 2a-c) [7-12]. In PfNapS, 23 residues
of the dimerization helix α2 and four residues of α7 and
α8 (which lie in domain II) contribute to dimer formation
via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions
(Asp32, Phe33, Ile36, Gln37, Ile40, Leu43, Asp44, Lys45,
Cys47, Glu50, Gln51, Ile54, Gln55, Gln57, Tyr58, Lys61,
Lys62, Leu65, Phe66, Lys68, Arg69, Ile72, Ile73 and
His210, Pro212, Leu313, Leu217 respectively). The overall sequence identity of PfNapS with yNAP-1, Vps75,
hSET and PfNapL is 20, 17, 25 and 18% respectively. Similar to PfNapL and other NAPs in the malaria parasite [7],
PfNapS is also evolutionary distant from homologs in
yeast and human (Additional file 1). The length of the
dimerization helix α2 varies in all the five proteins and
PfNapS has the shortest such helix comprising of 41 residues (Table 2). The root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d)
of PfNapS with yNAP-1, hSET, Vps75 and PfNapL is 1.9,
1.6, 2.0 and 1.9 Å respectively (Table 2; Figure 2a-c).
PfNapS exhibits the highest sequence identity (25%) as
well as structural similarity with hSET. Also, the r.m.s.d.
of PfNapS is lowest with hSET at 1.6 Å indicating high
structural identity (Table 2; Figure 2a, b). The N-terminal
in PfNapS (aa 1-28) is missing in the present construct
whereas in hSET the N-terminal is ordered (aa 1-15) and
forms a helical structure α1 (aa 2-12). The region 195-200
of domain II in hSET is disordered and its corresponding
region (aa 191-196) in PfNapS has weak electron density.
The helices α7 and α8 on side of the β sub-domain of
PfNapS are similar in length and orientation to hSET.
Interestingly, the disorder in the present structure of
PfNapS is also closest to hSET structure (Figure 2a, b).

The overall sequence identity of PfNapS with yNAP-1
and Vps75 is 20 and 17% respectively. The differences
with respect to yNAP-1 and Vps75 are in the overall
structural orientations of secondary structures (Table 2;
Figure 2a, c). The major difference with yNAP-1 is
absence of the 'accessory domain' in PfNapS. It has been
earlier shown that this 'accessory domain' is absent in
PfNapS, PfNapL and their homologs from other Plasmodium species [7]. A sequence comparison of PfNapS with
other apicomplexan parasites like Toxoplasma, Babesia
and Theileria revealed that this domain region is absent
in them too (Additional file 2). Since the 'accessory
domain' is absent in Vps75 and hSET as well (which are
primarily localized in the nucleus), it remains unclear
what role this domain plays in nuclear shuttling of these
proteins, as was suggested for yNAP-1 [7-9]. The region

168-181 of PfNapS is disordered, however, Vps75 has an
ordered helical content in this region (aa 153-176) and
yNAP-1 has anti-parallel β-strands containing the
nuclear localization signal (NLS). Also, comparisons with
the identified NLS in yNAP-1 have revealed that PfNapS
lacks an NLS which is also the case for Vps75.
A sequence alignment of PfNapS with other homologs
from Plasmodium species (Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium berghei, Plasmodium knowlesi, Plasmodium yoelii
and Plasmodium chabaudi) revealed high sequence conservation amongst them (75-90%). Further analysis
showed that the N-terminal exhibits lower conservation
but the C-terminal contains acidic stretches in all of these
proteins (Additional file 1). Dimer contributing residues
of the dimerization helix α2 and domain II are well conserved in all structural homologs. Residues implicated in

PfNapL for histone recognition are not conserved in
PfNapS suggesting variable binding site for histones [7].
Also, a comparison of the residues from hSET mutagenesis data revealed that corresponding residues in PfNapS
and its homologs from Plasmodium and other apicomplexans show overall weak conservation (Additional file 1).
Gene knockout studies of PfNapS and its localization in the
parasite

To assess the role of PfNapS in vivo, disruption of the corresponding gene was attempted from genome of P. falciparum 3D7 strain. Despite several attempts, the gene
could not be disrupted indicating an essential role for this
gene (Additional file 3). This observation is consistent
with unsuccessful attempts to disrupt NapS in the murine
malaria parasite P. berghei [34]. Due to the current technological limitations imposed by the Plasmodium systems, the essentiality of PfNapS could not be formally
proven; however, these results provide circumstantial evidence for a very important role played by PfNapS. Gene
knockout phenotypes in several other studied organisms

have indicated the essentiality of nucleosome assembly
proteins. It has been shown that gene ablations in mouse
and Drosophila cause embryonic lethality whereas in
yeast cells exhibit growth defects [35-37]. Therefore, it is
not surprising that the malaria parasite likely requires
this gene for survival.
It has been earlier shown that PfNapS is expressed during all parasite blood stages, and immunofluorescence
assays suggested a close association of PfNapS with parasite nucleus [5,6]. To address the issue of potential
sequences within PfNapS which might target this protein
to the parasite nucleus (in the absence of a clear NLS
motif ), full-length PfNapS was fused with green fluorescence protein (GFP) and these gene fusions were
expressed episomally in wild-type parasite. The protein
chimeras showed a nuclear localization in all stages of
erythrocytic life-cycle as determined by co-localization
with the nuclear stain DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; nuclear stain) (Figure 3a, c-f). Western blot analysis
using anti-GFP antibodies confirmed the expression of
fusion proteins (Figure 3b). All fused proteins ran at the

Gill et al. Malaria Journal 2010, 9:90
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/9/1/90

expected sizes except for residues 30-90-GFP which
resulted in a band at around 29 kDa rather than the predicted 34 kDa. One possible explanation might be the relative high content of glutamines and glutamic acids in
this fusion protein resulting in aberrant protein mobility.
The three truncated forms consisting of aa1-30-GFP,
aa30-90-GFP and aa90-269-GFP (Figure 3a) showed different localizations in live cell fluorescence microscopy:
aa90-269 showed a similar nuclear localization to the fulllength chimera, whereas aa1-30-GFP and aa30-90-GFP
showed fluorescence in the parasite cytoplasm. Therefore, it seems likely that the region responsible for targeting PfNapS to the nucleus is contained within PfNapS
residues 90-269. The localization of these fusion proteins
did not alter during the parasite life-cycle stages in immunofluorescence assays (Additional file 3). In the wellstudied yeast NAP (yNAP-1), residues 290-295
('RKQRNK') have been experimentally identified as an
NLS [9]. It has been previously shown that the corresponding region in PfNapL (aa 203-207, 'KKQHNK') is
disordered in the crystal structure, and in any case
PfNapL seems resident in the parasite cytoplasm [7]
(Table 2; Figure 2a). In the case of nuclear associated
PfNapS, the corresponding region is again disordered (aa
172 to 177-'NRSDLD') [7,9] (Table 2, Figure 2a-b). Therefore, GFP-fusion transfection data suggest that PfNapS
likely contains NLS-like motif in residues 90-269 but the
set or sets of motifs, which direct PfNapS to the nucleus
remain to be discovered.
PfNapS-histone interaction using fluorescence
spectroscopy

Structural analysis reveals two free surface exposed
cysteine residues (Cys47 and Cys154) in PfNapS dimer.
The first residue Cys47 is present at concave region of the
dimerization helix α2 whereas Cys154 is present on outer
surface of domain II (Figure 4a). These cysteines were
labelled on PfNapS using molecular environment sensitive dye 6-acryloyl-2-dimethyl-aminonaphthalene (acrylodan) which binds covalently to surface exposed cysteine
residues. Post modification, the tagged protein (PfNapSdye) was passed through gel filtration column to remove
unbound dye. PfNapSdye was then used in histone interaction studies. Upon titrating PfNapSdye with histone
monomers and histone oligomers a gradual blue shift was
observed along with an increase in the quantum yield
(Figure 4b). This chromic shift reaches a saturation level
and then no further blue shift or increase is observed
upon addition of either the same histone or a different
one. These data suggest embedding of the tagged
cysteines upon binding of PfNapSdye to histones. Such
interaction likely causes transition of dye from a polar
(fully exposed to solvent) to a non-polar environment (i.e.
burial at Nap-histone interface).

Page 8 of 15

To further investigate probable histone binding
region(s) on PfNapS, these two surface cysteine residues
on PfNapS were mutated independently (mutants are
referred to as C47A and C154A). On plotting the change
in fluorescence as a function of histone concentration, it
was observed that in the absence of histone, the chromic
shift was similar for these mutants. This analysis suggests
that both the cysteine residues experienced same solvent
environment. Upon adding histones, a blue shift was
observed along with an increase in the quantum yield
suggesting that C47A and C154A might play a role in histone binding. However, a higher change in the chromic
shift in C154A (about two times) in comparison to C47A
(Figure 4d) possibly suggests a bigger role of C154A in the
binding interaction.
Interestingly, no chromic shift or increase in the quantum yield in fluorescence was observed on titrating the
PfNapSdye with linker histone H1 indicating no change in
the dielectric constant of the microenvironment around
the fluorophore (Figure 4e). These data suggest a different mode and/or region of binding of linker histone H1 to
PfNapS as opposed to the core histones. To rule out the
possibility that the dye could be affecting binding of histone H1 to PfNapS, interaction of labelled PfNapS with
histone H1 was analysed and compared it with binding
with histone H3. No significant difference was observed
in binding of these histones to PfNapS (Figure 4c). These
data are in agreement with previously published work,
which suggested differential binding of NAPs to linker
histone H1 when compared with core histones and histone oligomers [38,39]. Interestingly, no clear homolog
for histone H1 has been identified in Plasmodium or
indeed in any apicomplexan organism so far. However,
histone H1 sequences tend to vary and it is likely that
their overall structure is more conserved. It would be very
unusual if apicomplexans lacked linker histone H1 altogether. The above experiments were done with all canonical histones with the assumption that apicomplexans will
have a structural homolog of linker histone H1.
Comparison of histone binding characteristics of NAP/SET
structures

Mutagenesis studies performed previously on hSET had
revealed important residues in domain II that affect the
binding of hSET to both core histones and dsDNA [10].
These residues were mapped onto the PfNapS dimer and
most of the corresponding ones are not conserved with
hSET except for Lys163 and Thr190 (Table 4). Only six of
the 12 residues that affect binding of hSET to histones
(completely or to a marginal extent) are conserved in
PfNapS. In the previous study on the cytoplasmically resident PfNapL, six residues of PfNapL were mutated based
upon the hSET mutagenesis data and it was shown that
these six had no effect on the binding of PfNapL to his-

tones [7]. These six residues are mostly conserved
amongst PfNapL and PfNapS with only the residues
His227 and Tyr259 of PfNapL replaced in PfNapS by glutamine and proline residues respectively (Table 5). Three
residues of PfNapL have been earlier identified that
potentially contribute to histone recognition, based on
Asf1-histone complex analysis [7,40,41]. Although two of
these residues of PfNapL are not conserved in PfNapS,
the third is in fact an alanine in PfNapL and a cysteine
(Cys154) in PfNapS. Interestingly, new fluorescence data
indicates a role for region encompassing this cysteine
(Cys154) in interaction with all core histones, except with
linker histone H1. In summary, the studies on PfNapL
and PfNapS together suggest a region or regions in
domain II of nucleosome assembly proteins which likely
contribute to histone recognition.

Phosphorylation status

It has been earlier shown that both PfNapL and PfNapS
are phosphorylated by casein kinase II (CKII) [5,6]. Programs NetPhos and NetPhosK predicted phosphorylation sites on PfNapS of which three residues Ser91,
Thr190 and Thr191 (CKII phosphorylation site) are surface exposed in the structure. All these residues have corresponding serine and/or threonine residues respectively
in hSET and PfNapL, which are also surface exposed.
However, the site Ser91 of PfNapS is replaced by cysteine
and alanine residues and Thr190 is replaced by aspartate
and arginine residues in yNAP-1 and Vps75 respectively.
Thus, the phosphorylation sites predicted for PfNapS are
conserved in PfNapL and in hSET but not in yNAP-1 and
Vps75. Further, the three phosphorylation sites which
have been earlier identified for yNAP-1 lie in the 'accessory domain' region which is absent in PfNapS, PfNapL,

Gill et al. Malaria Journal 2010, 9:90
http://www.malariajournal.com/content/9/1/90

Page 12 of 15

hSET and Vps75. Interestingly, the corresponding residues for Ser184 of PfNapS that lie in the conserved
hydrophobic motif (SIFEWF) are conserved and surface
exposed in all the five structures and could possibly represent a common phosphorylation site for NAP/SET proteins (Figures 2a, 5c). This conserved residue is not a
predicted CKII site on any of these five proteins but
nonetheless may be of significance given its conservation
in these proteins.
In summary, these comparative structural analyses
show that PfNapS, PfNapL, hSET, yNAP-1 and Vps75
contain conserved residues in the dimerization helix
which contribute to dimer formation in all these five proteins (Table 6 and Figure 5a). Functional data on PfNapS
indicate the inability to delete PfNapS gene suggesting its
essentiality in the parasite. Transfection studies identify
parasite nucleus as the site for localization of PfNapS.
Fluorescence data analysis highlights two regions on
PfNapS dimer which are likely to contribute to histone
recognition (Figure 5b). Finally, it is likely that the region
for histone recognition on NAPs and SET domains may
be the outer face of domain II and base of the cavity in the
underside of each dimer (Figure 5b).

Yeast two-hybrid studies on interacting partners of
PfNapS suggest a crucial role for this protein in numerous
protein networks [42]. A total of 27 proteins have been
shown to interact with PfNapS [42]. However, in the
absence of independent experimental validation of each
of these protein-protein interactions, it is premature to
speculate on their biological relevance. Nonetheless, an
attempt was made to classify these binding partners for
PfNapS. Analysis suggests that three of the 27 proteins
are predicted to be localized to the parasite nucleus
(Additional file 4). Further, a total of six of 27 proteins are
likely to be involved in chromatin modelling (Additional
file 4). The crystal structures of these interacting proteins
are unknown and, therefore, their binding modes with
PfNapS remain unexplored. Clearly, these studies presented here pave the way for deeper dissection of numerous protein-proteins interactions that occur with PfNapS.

Conclusions
The on-going structural, biochemical, gene knockout and
localization studies on the two nucleosome assembly proteins from P. falciparum have revealed similar threedimensional structures for the two proteins whilst having
different localizations within the parasite. Based on
