Ciliary photoreceptors in the cerebral eyes of a
protostome larva

Abstract
Background: Eyes in bilaterian metazoans have been described as being composed of either ciliary or
rhabdomeric photoreceptors. Phylogenetic distribution, as well as distinct morphologies and characteristic
deployment of different photopigments (ciliary vs. rhabdomeric opsins) and transduction pathways argue for the
co-existence of both of these two photoreceptor types in the last common bilaterian ancestor. Both receptor types
exist throughout the Bilateria, but only vertebrates are thought to use ciliary photoreceptors for directional light
detection in cerebral eyes, while all other invertebrate bilaterians studied utilize rhabdomeric photoreceptors for
this purpose. In protostomes, ciliary photoreceptors that express c-opsin have been described only from a nonvisual deep-brain photoreceptor. Their homology with vertebrate rods and cones of the human eye has been
hypothesized to represent a unique functional transition from non-visual to visual roles in the vertebrate lineage.
Results: To test the hypothesis that protostome cerebral eyes employ exclusively rhabdomeric photoreceptors, we
investigated the ultrastructure of the larval eyes in the brachiopod Terebratalia transversa. We show that these
pigment-cup eyes consist of a lens cell and a shading pigment cell, both of which are putative photoreceptors,
deploying a modified, enlarged cilium for light perception, and have axonal connections to the larval brain. Our
investigation of the gene expression patterns of c-opsin, Pax6 and otx in these eyes confirms that the larval eye
spots of brachiopods are cerebral eyes that deploy ciliary type photoreceptors for directional light detection.
Interestingly, c-opsin is also expressed during early embryogenesis in all potential apical neural cells, becoming
restricted to the anterior neuroectoderm, before expression is initiated in the photoreceptor cells of the eyes.
Coincident with the expression of c-opsin in the presumptive neuroectoderm, we found that middle gastrula stage
embryos display a positive photoresponse behavior, in the absence of a discrete shading pigment or axonal
connections between cells.
Conclusions: Our results indicate that the dichotomy in the deployment of ciliary and rhabdomeric
photoreceptors for directional light detection is not as clear-cut as previously thought. Analyses of brachiopod
larval eyes demonstrate that the utilization of c-opsin expressing ciliary photoreceptors in cerebral eyes is not
limited to vertebrates. The presence of ciliary photoreceptor-based eyes in protostomes suggests that the transition
between non-visual and visual functions of photoreceptors has been more evolutionarily labile than previously
recognized, and that co-option of ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptor cell types for directional light detection
has occurred multiple times during animal evolution. In addition, positive photoresponse behavior in gastrula stage
embryos suggests that a discrete shading pigment is not requisite for directional photoreception in metazoans.
Scanning photoreception of light intensities mediating cell-autonomous changes of ciliary movement may
represent an ancient mechanism for regulating locomotory behavior, and is likely to have existed prior to the
evolution of eye-mediated directional light detection employing axonal connections to effector cells and a discreet
shading pigment.

Background
Bilaterian photoreceptor cells are generally classified as
having either ciliary or rhabdomeric morphologies,
depending upon the origin of the elaborated membranes
that compose their light-sensitive structures [1,2]. Recent
phylogenetic and expression analyses of opsin photopigments suggest that two non-homologous phototransduction cascades characterize ciliary and rhabdomeric
photoreceptors in bilaterians [3-7]. Opsins code for
G-coupled protein receptors, which are localized to the
elaborated membranes of photoreceptors and participate
in the phototransduction pathway. Phylogenetic analyses
have demonstrated that all bilaterian opsins have a
monophyletic origin, with several classes, including ciliary opsins (c-opsins) and rhabdomeric opsins (r-opsins),
having diverged prior to the last common ancestor of
bilaterians [3,7]. In both deuterostomes and protostomes,
ciliary opsin (c-opsin) genes have been found to be
expressed in photoreceptors with a ciliary morphology,
while rhabdomeric opsin (r-opsin) genes are expressed in
photoreceptors with rhabdomeric morphology. This
dichotomy suggests that these two distinct types of
photoreceptors, and their associated phototransduction
pathways, coexisted in the bilaterian ancestor [5-7].
Larval eyespots of protostomes are of particular interest
in the study of photoreceptor evolution, since their structure has been proposed to resemble the bilaterian prototype two-celled eye [3,8]. Cerebral eyes have been defined
as pigmented photoreceptor organs that (a) are positioned
in the anterior region of the body in a region of Otx
expression, (b) are connected to the anterior axonal scaffold and, (c) express Pax6 [3]. Based upon these criteria
the eyes of many protostome larvae and of deuterostome
tornaria larvae have been identified as potentially homologous structures. The discovery that r-opsin orthologs are
expressed in larval rhabdomeric photoreceptors of the
polychaete Platynereis dumerilii and in vertebrate retinal
ganglion cells (with non-visual function), together with the
development of these photoreceptors from ath-positive
precursor cells in both animal groups, has led to the
assumption of homology of these cell types [4]. In contrast
to this, ciliary photoreceptors in protostomes seem to be
primarily restricted to non-visual functions (for example,
deep-brain photoreceptors in P. dumerilii), but their
photopigment represents the invertebrate ortholog of the
c-opsin expressed in visual rods and cones of the vertebrate eye, suggesting common ancestry of these ciliary
photoreceptors [6]. Those protostome visual photoreceptors that do have a ciliary morphology (for example, the
mantle eyes of scallops) have generally been inferred to be
non-homologous evolutionary novelties [3,9,10]. Following
this scenario, protostome larval cerebral eyes are predicted
to deploy exclusively rhabdomeric photoreceptors

expressing the r-opsin photopigment, while the deployment of ciliary photoreceptors in the vertebrate eye is the
result of their having been substituted for rhabdomeric
photoreceptors early in the evolution of the chordate
lineage [3].
Brachiopods represent an intriguing group for understanding the evolution of photoreceptors, given their
representation in the early fossil record of metazoans.
Recent phylogenomic analyses have evidenced that brachiopods are derived members of the clade Spiralia
(Lophotrochozoa), closely related to nemerteans and
annelids [11,12]. The larvae of several articulate brachiopods have been described as having larval eye spots;
however, the morphology of these structures has not
been examined in detail [13,14].
To ascertain the nature of larval eyespots in articulate
brachiopods, we have conducted a detailed morphological study of these structures in Terebratalia transversa.
We have also assessed the presence of molecular components of eye formation. Finally, we have tested for photoresponsive behavior in early stage embryos to evaluate
the possible function of an unexpected early domain of
opsin gene expression.

Results
Ultrastructure of Terebratalia eyes

The lecithotrophic larvae of the brachiopod Terebratalia
transversa have two rows of a variable number (three to
eight) of pigmented spots, which extend in a mediolateral
line slightly anterior of the dorsal rim of the apical lobe.
These pigment spots, which have previously been
described as eye spots [15], are visible only in the fully
developed swimming larvae (Figure 1A, B; 96 hours post
fertilization at 8°C). To determine whether these pigment
spots are associated with photoreceptors, we performed
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on ultrathin sections of the larva (Figure 1C-G). Ultrastructural analysis
demonstrated that the pigment spots are part of a simple
eye composed of two putative photoreceptor cells (Figure
1D, E). One cell contains an apical intracellular lens-like
structure, while the other cell contains the pigment granules (Figure 1D, E). These pigment granules are arranged
in cuboidal vesicles to form a shading structure adjacent
to the basal surface of the lens. Both cells possess enlarged
ciliary membranes, characteristic of ciliary photoreceptor
cells, located between the lens and the shading pigment
(Figure 1E, F, I; Additional File 1A-K). The receptive cilia
of both cells have a typical 9 × 2 + 2 pattern of microtubule organization (Figure 1G; Additional file 1L). Both
photoreceptor cells also contain axons extending from the
basal surface of the cell (Figure 1I). Serial ultrathin sections of whole larvae demonstrated that both photoreceptor cells of each larval eyespot have axonal connections

c-opsin, the glutamate counterion found in transmembrane domain III of many chordate c-opsins is not conserved in Terebratalia c-opsin (Figure 2). Phylogenetic
reconstructions of the opsin gene family using both
Bayesian and maximum likehood methods support that
the gene cloned is an ortholog of other bilaterian c-opsin
genes (Figure 3). We have, therefore, designated this gene
Terebratalia transversa ciliary opsin (Tt-c-opsin).

leading to the apical concentration of nerve cells (the
ganglion or ‘larval brain’), supporting the cerebral nature
of brachiopod larval eyes (Figure 1H).
Orthology assignment of Terebratalia transversa ciliary
opsin

The ciliary nature of the Terebratalia larval photoreceptors was further tested by examining the expression of a
ciliary opsin (c-opsin) gene cloned from Terebratalia.
A 422 amino acid (aa) full-length gene product was predicted from cloned cDNA sequences and aligned to protein sequences of opsin proteins from other bilaterian
taxa. The predicted Terebratalia c-opsin protein sequence
possesses seven transmembrane domains, which is characteristic of all G protein-coupled receptors, as well as a conserved lysine in transmembrane domain VII, which is
specific to opsins and forms a Schiff base with retinal to
form rhodopsin (Figure 2). In addition, the predicted protein possesses conserved C-terminal motifs that are unique
to c-opsins (Figure 2; Additional file 2). As in Platynereis

Developmental expression of Tt-c-opsin

As detected by whole mount in-situ hybridization with a
1,584 nucleotide antisense probe, Tt-c-opsin expression is
observed at the middle larval stage, when the three lobes
(apica, mantle and pedicle) of the larva are well developed and setogenesis has commenced (Figure 4A, B).
Tt-c-opsin is expressed in two rows of punctate domains
on the dorsal surface of the apical lobe (Figure 4A, B).
These expression domains are positioned anterior to the
rim of the apical lobe and extend in a mediolateral line,
separated at the midline. As such, the larval expression of

Figure 2 Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences for Terebratalia c-opsin and representative opsins from other taxa. Consensus
amino acids (>50%) for the alignment of all opsins are shaded grey. Consensus amino acids only for the alignment of c-opsins are shaded
green. In some cases the consensus residue for c-opsins differs than that for all opsins. C-opsins have a purple background, r-opsins have an
orange background, and ourgroup opsins have a white background. A red bar highlights the conserved C-terminal motif of c-opsins.
Transmembrane helices I-VII are marked with black horizontal lines. (‡) marks the position of the glutamate counterion and (◊) marks the
conserved lysine that forms a Schiff base with retinal to form rhodopsin.

Figure 4 Developmental expression of Tt-c-opsin. (A, B) At the middle larva stage Tt-c-opsin is expressed in two laterally symmetrical
punctate domains, just anterior of the dorsal rim of the apical lobe (black arrows), consistent with the location of the larval eye spots, as
observed in (A) dorsal and (B) lateral views. A medial-anterior domain of weak expression is also observed (black arrowhead in panel A). (C, D)
At the early gastrula stage broad expression of Tt-c-opsin is observed at the animal pole, opposite the blastopore (*). (E, F) By the middle
gastrula stage the blastopore (*) has shifted 90° relative to the animal pole, and Tt-c-opsin expression becomes localized to a medial anterior
domain, which persists through the early larva stage (G, H). (C, E, G) blastoporal views; (D, F, H) lateral views.

Developmental expression of Tt-Pax6 and Tt-Otx

Tt-c-opsin directly matches the position of the eyespots,
supporting the ciliary nature of these photoreceptors.
In examining a range of embryonic stages, the first
onset of Tt-c-opsin expression was observed, unexpectedly, at the early gastrula stage (Figure 4C, D). At this
stage, Tt-c-opsin displays a broad domain of expression
at the animal pole, the site of presumptive neurectodermal tissue, opposite the blastopore. By the middle gastrula stage the blastopore has shifted 90° relative to the
animal pole, forming the anteroposterior and dorsoventral axes. At this stage Tt-c-opsin is localized to a subset
of cells directly anterior of the apical tuft, which are
derived from the animal pole (Figure 4E, F). The medial-anterior domain of expression persists through the
early larval stages, when the three larval regions (apical,
mantle and pedicle lobes) are first distinguishable,
(Figure 4E, F). The medial-anterior domain of expression is distinct from larval expression in the presumptive eyes, and begins to fade once the trilobed larva has
formed and setagenesis has commenced (Figure 4A, B).

To further evaluate whether the Terebratalia larval
photoreceptors are bona fide cerebral eyes we analyzed
the expression of Pax6 and Otx orthologs. These two
genes encode transcription factors that have been
hypothesized to have conserved roles in the specification
of cerebral eyes across bilaterians. For Pax6 a 433 aa full
length gene product was predicted from cDNA
sequences, and for Otx a 270 aa gene product was predicted from cDNA sequences. Phylogenetic reconstructions supported the orthology assignments, and we have
therefore named the cloned genes Terebratalia transversa Pax6 (Tt-Pax6) and Terebratalia transversa Otx
(Tt-Otx), respectively (Figure 5).
At the early larval stage, Tt-Pax6 is expressed in two
broad triangular domains in the dorsal epidermis of the
presumptive apical lobe (Figure 6A, D). These two
domains of expression meet in a narrow region at the
midline, and expand both anteriorly and, to a lesser extent,
posteriorly towards the lateral regions of the embryo.

length of the apical lobe posterior of the anterior end of
the embryo. The placement of the overlap in Tt-Pax6
and Tt-Otx expression is, therefore, consistent with
these two genes being co-expressed in the site of presumptive larval eyespot formation. The domains of overlapping Tt-Pax6 and Tt-Otx expression are in stripes of
contiguous cells, rather than the punctate expression
observed for Tt-c-opsin expression at the middle larva
stage.
By the middle larval stage, when setae have begun to
form, Tt-Pax6 expression was observed in the dorsal
half of the apical lobe, extending from the posterior
edge of the lobe to just anterior of the rim of the lobe
(Figure 7A, B). The anterior portion of this expression
pattern overlaps with the site of Tt-c-opsin expression
(Figure 7C, D).

At the early larval stage there are five domains of TtOtx expression on the dorsal side of the forming apical
lobe (Figure 6B, E). One medial spot of expression is
located near the posterior edge of the apical lobe. Two
sets of laterally symmetrical stripes of expression are
located in the anterior region of the apical lobe. The
more anterior pair of stripes is slightly offset from the
midline, and the stripes extend in an anteroposterior
orientation. The second pair of stripes is located more
posteriorly, and the stripes extend at approximately a
45° angle relative to the anteroposterior axis, centered
on the medial spot of expression. These more posterior
stripes extend to the lateral sides of the embryo and do
not contact the medial spot of expression.
Double labeling of Tt-Pax6 and Tt-Otx demonstrated
that the two genes are co-expressed only in a narrow
region on the dorsal surface of the developing apical
lobe at the early larval stage (Figure 6C, H). At this
stage the posterior lateral bands of Tt-Otx expression
overlap with the anterior edges of the Tt-Pax6 expression domain (Figure 6H). The region of overlap extends
mediolaterally along the dorsal surface of the apical
lobe, and is located approximately one-third of the

Expression of opsin genes in tissues other than pigmented
eyes (for example, c-opsin expression in the Platynereis
adult brain [6]) has generally been viewed as related to
detection of non-directional light signals, such as diurnal
cycles, due to the lack of a shading pigment to block offaxis illumination of the photoreceptor [6,16]. Terebratalia
embryos hatch as ciliated blastulae, and by the middle gastrula stage, when anteroposterior polarity is first established, their swimming is spiral with a left-handed rotation
about the anteroposterior axis. To evaluate whether early
Tt-c-opsin might be part of an early directional photoreceptor, we tested for photoresponsive behavior in middle
gastrula stage embryos, when Tt-c-opsin expression
becomes restricted to the medial anterior domain.
Middle gastrula stage embryos were placed in a phototaxis chamber where directional illumination could be
introduced from one side of the chamber. Prior to the
initiation of directional illumination the embryos
showed no significant difference in distribution between
the two sides of the chamber (Figure 8; Additional file
3; P = 0.22; n = 3). 20 to 25 minutes after initiation of
directional illumination, embryos showed a significant
bias in distribution towards the illuminated side of the
chamber (Figure 8; Additional file 4; P = 0.005; n = 3).
5 to 10 minutes after extinguishment of directional illumination the embryos had returned to an equal distribution between the two sides of the chamber (Figure 8;
Additional file 5; P = 0.34; n = 3). Distributions before
and after illumination were equivalent (P = 0.17), while
both differed significantly from the distribution during
illumination (P = 0.02 and P = 0.01, respectively).
Although the behavior of three-lobed stage larvae with
eyespots in culture suggests that they are also photoresponsive, measurements in a phototaxis chamber did
not yield a quantifiable response to directional illumination (data not shown).

Discussion
The diversity of eyes throughout the bilaterians has led
to an ongoing debate regarding their evolution. Based
upon the observation that photoreceptive structures
generally have either ciliary or rhabdomeric morphology,
Eakin [1,9] proposed two lines of photoreceptor evolution, with the rhabdomeric type having evolved from the
ciliary type early in the protostome lineage. Vanfleteren
and Coomans [17] concluded that rhabdomeric photoreceptors were a subset of ciliary photoreceptors, and thus
photoreceptors are homologous across bilaterians. In
contrast to both these interpretations, Salvini-Plawen
and Mayr [10,18] interpreted the diversity of photoreceptors as evidence of polyphyletic origins, postulating
that photoreceptors have evolved many times independently in bilaterians.
The advent of molecular genetics led to the unexpected
discovery that homologs of several transcription factor
families are required for eye formation in both vertebrates and Drosophila, including otx/orthodenticle, Six3/
sine oculis, and Pax6/eyeless. The role of Drosophila eyeless and vertebrate Pax6 genes in eye development, as
well as the apparent functional equivalence of numerous
orthologs from diverse bilaterian taxa, prompted Gehring
and Ikeo [8] to propose a monophyletic origin for bilaterian eyes. While the homology of eyes based upon a role
for Pax6 as a “master control gene” has been criticized as
an oversimplification [19] it appears that Pax6 is a key
player in eye development of most bilaterians.
The potential for the phylogenetic distribution of photoreceptors with ciliary and rhabdomeric morphologies to
be of evolutionary significance has been bolstered by the
recognition that the two types of photoreceptors are characterized by the expression of distinct classes of opsin
genes. In all cases examined to date, photoreceptors with

ciliary morphology have been shown to express c-opsin
class genes and rhabdomeric photoreceptors express
r-opsin genes (with the exception of the scallop Mizuhopecten, where the mantle eyes have ciliary morphology,
but have been shown to express a Go opsin [20]).
Based upon the occurrence of rhabdomeric photoreceptors in the larval eyes of annelids, arthropods and
hemichordates, Arendt and Wittbrodt [3] have suggested
that while rhabdomeric and ciliary photoreceptors co-existed in the last common ancestor of bilaterians, the use
of rhabdomeric photoreceptors is the ancestral condition,
with ciliary photoreceptors having been co-opted for
vision within the vertebrate lineage. To date, the expression of c-opsin class genes has been investigated in only
two protostomes, the annelid Platynereis [6] and the honeybee Apis [16]. In both cases, expression was observed
in the brain, and due to the lack of pigmentation in both
these structures they have been inferred to be non-visual
photoreceptors. While we observed early expression of
Tt-c-opsin in the presumptive neuroectoderm at gastrula
and early larval stages of Terebratalia development, we
did not observe expression in the apical ganglion, which
may be comparable to the brain of other protostomes.
Ciliary larval eyes in Terebratalia: novelty, substitution, or
ancestral condition?

By ultrastructural analysis we have demonstrated that the
larval eyespots of the brachiopod Terebratalia are composed of two photoreceptors cells, one forming the lens
cell and the other the pigmented shading cell. Both cells
possess elaborated ciliary membranes in the intercellular
space between the lens and the pigment granules, as well
as axonal projections extending to the apical ganglion.
Supporting the ciliary nature of the larval photoreceptors,
we observed that a c-opsin gene is expressed specifically
at the position of the eyespots in the larva. Together
these results evidence that the Terebratalia larvae possess cerebral eyes that are capable of directional light
detection, and that are of a ciliary nature, based upon
both morphological and molecular criteria.
Given that Brachiopoda group within the protostome
clade Spiralia (Lophotrochozoa) in molecular phylogenies [11,12,21], our results provoke the question of
whether ciliary photoreceptors play a more important
role in protostome eye evolution than previously
thought. Whereas polychaete trochophore larvae deploy
rhabdomeric photoreceptors (r-opsin expression) directly
connected to locomotory cilia for directional movement
[22], the morphology of the Terebratalia eyespots
strongly suggests that brachiopods use ciliary photoreceptors with c-opsin expression for the same purpose.
We cannot rule out the possibility that an r-opsin
homolog is also expressed in the larval eyes of

Figure 9 Alternative hypothesis on the evolution of photoreceptor deployment in cerebral eyes. Schematic representation of three
hypotheses accounting for the deployment of ciliary photoreceptors in the cerebral eyes of Terebratalia and vertebrates, versus rhabdomeric
photoreceptors in Platynereis and other protostomes. (A) Deployment of rhabdomeric photoreceptors as the ancestral state in cerebral eyes, with
the larval eyes of Terebratalia, containing ciliary photoreceptors, representing an evolutionary novelty. The deployment of ciliary photoreceptors
is the result of a substitution (with ciliary photoreceptors having replaced rhabdomeric photoreceptors in the cerebral eyes) early in the chordate
lineage. (B) Larval eyes in Terebratalia are homologous to the cerebral eyes in other protostomes, but ciliary photoreceptors have been
substituted for rhabdomeric photoreceptors, as in the vertebrates. (C) Ciliary photoreceptors in cerebral eyes represent the ancestral condition,
inherited by Terebratalia and vertebrates. Deployment of rhabdomeric photoreceptors in the cerebral eyes of Platynereis and other protostomes
are the result of substitution events.

Terebratalia, as our attempts to clone such a gene with
degenerate primers were unsuccessful.
If manifold independent acquisition of photoreceptor
cells in Bilateria can be ruled out by the duality of the
existing phototransduction cascades and their respective
photoreceptor cell types (rPRCs versus cPRCs) based on
bilaterian opsin phylogeny [3], a functional switch from
visual to non-visual roles (or vice versa) for the two
commonly inherited photoreceptor cell types may have
happened several times independently in bilaterian evolution. Such a scenario has already been proposed for
the evolution of the visual rods and cones in the vertebrate retina as derivatives of non-visual ciliary deepbrain photoreceptors of invertebrates, such as those in
the annelid Platynereis [6].
For the evolution of brachiopod larval eyes this suggests that brachiopods have retained ciliary photoreceptor cells from the bilaterian ancestor, and deployed
these for directional light detection in their larval eye
spots. Given that ciliary photoreceptor cells are a plesiomorphic trait, rather than being independently
evolved in brachiopods, three alternative scenarios may
account for the ciliary nature of the larval eyes in Terebratalia: I) The larval eyes of Terebratalia are evolutionary novelties, unrelated to the rhabdomeric
cerebral eyes of other larvae in the clade Spiralia; II)
The cerebral eyes of Terebratalia are homologous to
the larval eyes of other members of the clade Spiralia
(for example, polychaetes and mollusks), with ciliary

photoreceptor cells having been substituted for the
rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells observed in the larval
eyes of other taxa; III) Larval eyes with ciliary photoreceptors are the ancestral condition for protostomes
and have been inherited by Terebratalia.
Visual photoreceptors with ciliary-type morphologies
have been identified in several protostomes; however,
these organs have generally been regarded as evolutionary novelties due to their morphological locations (for
example,the branchial crown eyes in polycheates [23,24],
and the mantle eyes of scallops [25]. The ciliary larval
eyes of Terebratalia could likewise represent an evolutionary novelty that has recruited a ciliary photoreceptor
to form a cerebral larval eye comparable to, but not
homologous with, the rhabdomeric larval eyes of other
spiralians (Figure 9A).
Although the ciliary photoreceptor cells in the larval
eyes of Terebratalia seem not to be homologous to the
rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells in the larval eyes of
Platynereis and other protostomes, the possibility exists
that there is homology at the level of the larval eye. If
the regulation of eye specification is distinct from that
of photoreceptor cell differentiation, then the ciliary
photoreceptor cell may have been substituted for the
rhabdomeric photoreceptor cell in a homologous larval
eye (Figure 9B). In a variety of protostomes and deuterostomes, Pax6 and Otx (among other transcription factor genes) have been shown to be involved in eye
specification and differentiation, or to be expressed in

Passamaneck et al. EvoDevo 2011, 2:6
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/2/1/6

cerebral eyes or their precursors (for example, Drosophila [26,27], Platynereis [4,28], mouse [29,30]). Expression of Pax6 and Otx in the precursors of the
Terebratalia larval photoreceptors suggests that the
genetic network underlying the formation of the larval
eyes in Terebratalia shares common features with the
network underlying the specification of rhabdomeric larval eyes in other protostomes. In Terebratalia, ciliary
photoreceptor cells, and c-opsin expression, may have
been co-opted to supplant the rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells in homologous ancestral eyes. By analogy, ontogenetic changes from one photoreceptor cell type to the
other have been observed in the larval cerebral eyes of
the gastropod mollusk Aporrhais pespelecani, in which
the photoreceptor cell initially has a ciliary morphology,
only to later develop microvilli, taking on a mixed-type
morphology [31]. Although the expression of opsin
genes in the Aporrhais eye is unknown, the ontogentic
alterations it undergoes suggest that photoreceptor cell
morphology may be decoupled from cerebral eye
specification.
Finally, it should be considered that eyes with ciliary
photoreceptors represent the ancestral state for Spiralia,
and possibly for Bilateria (Figure 9C). Arendt and Wittbrodt [3] proposed that cerebral larval eyes with rhabdomeric photoreceptors represent the ancestral state for
Bilateria, based in part upon the occurrence of eyes with
this morphology in annelids, mollusks, platyhelminthes,
crustaceans and hemichordates. As stated above, eyes
with ciliary photoreceptors in protostomes have been
regarded as evolutionary novelties or “phylogenetically
young organs” [10]. However, it should be noted that
cerebral larval eyes with ciliary morphology have been
described from gastropod mollusks [32-35], and cerebral
larval eyes with both ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells have been described in both platyhelminthes
[36,37], and the hemichordate Ptychodera flava [38].
Likewise, photoreceptors with ciliary morphology, which
may be cerebral eyes, have been described from the larvae of ectoprocts [39,40] and an entoproct [41], both
of which are members of the protostome clade
Spiralia, along with brachiopods, annelids, mollusks, and
platyhelminthes [12].
While ciliary photoreceptors are not the predominant
form in the larval cerebral eyes of protostomes, they are
found in a phylogenetically diverse range of taxa. It
should, therefore, be considered that the use of ciliary
photoreceptors in eyes may be an ancestral condition
for Spiralia, and possibly Bilateria. In contrast to this
hypothesis, Arendt et al. [6] proposed that localization
of unpigmented ciliary receptors to the deep-brain, as
seen in Platynereis, represents the ancestral state for
bilaterians. However, Nilsson [42] has recently suggested
that such photoreceptors might historically been

Page 12 of 17

associated with shading pigments for use in directional
photoperception (that is, pigmented eyes). If this is the
case, then the ciliary eyes of Terebratalia and other spiralians may represent an ancestral condition, rather than
being evolutionary novelties.
A minimal photoreceptor mediating early photoresponse
behavior

The photoresponse behavior of the gastrula stage embryo
is a somewhat surprising result. This photoresponse may
be attributed to one of two alternative mechanisms,
phototaxis or photokinesis. Phototaxis, movement to or
away from light, is associated with directional photoreceptors, which are generally viewed as requiring an associated shading pigment to block off-axis light [3,43].
Nilsson [41] has proposed that scanning photoperception, wherein movement of the photoreceptor allows
detection of differential light intensities, may have provided a primitive mechanism detecting the directionality
of light; however, relatively few examples of such a
photoreceptor have been described. Although photoreceptors without associated shading pigments have been
described from a variety of metazoans, they have almost
always been attributed to having non-visual roles in monitoring ambient luminance, such as for detection of diurnal or lunar cycles of illumination. We propose that in
middle gastrula stage Terebratalia embryos, the yolk of
the lecithotrophic embryo acts as a partial shading pigment to block off axis light, while the spiral swimming
patterns serves to generate a scanning movement for
directional sampling of illumination intensities. Alternatively, accumulation of embryos on the brightly illuminated side of the chamber may represent a photokinetic
response; that is, a change in movement in response to
light, independent of photoreceptor orientation. In this
scenario, a slowing in the speed of ciliary beating of
c-opsin expressing cells in response to increased illumination could cause the distribution of embryos to shift
towards the light source. Further experiments are
required to resolve whether phototaxis of photokinesis is
responsible for the observed positive photoresponse
behavior of the middle gastrula stage embryos.
Irrespective of the mechanism of the photoresponse, it
is of particular interest that the positive photoresponse
behavior of the middle gastrula stage embryos occurs
before the onset of neuronal differentiation. At this stage
the c-opsin expressing cells and their neighbors constitute a ciliated columnar epithelium without axonal connections. This suggests that the photoresponsive cells
may also serve as direct behavior effectors, either through
alteration of ciliary beating patterns or through mediation of changes in the orientation of the elongate cilia of
the apical tuft to alter the direction of swimming in
response to light. An analogous case is that of the

Passamaneck et al. EvoDevo 2011, 2:6
http://www.evodevojournal.com/content/2/1/6

parenchymella larvae of certain sponges, which show
positive and/or negative phototaxis behavior in the
absence of a nervous system or gap junctions for cell-tocell communication. In sponge larvae, phototactic behavior is thought to be mediated by a posterior ring of pigmented cells [44-46]. However, the mechanism by which
changes in ciliary behavior in response to variable illumination may affect larval swimming behavior is not fully
understood [45,46]. In addition, no definitive opsin
ortholog has yet been isolated from sponges, although
over 200 rhodopsin-related GPCR genes have been identified in the recently published genome of Amphimedon
queenslandica [47]. It has been hypothesized that sponge
larvae may use a non-homologous mechanism for photoreception, such as flavin [48], carotenoid [48], or cytochrome c oxidase [49]. A minimal photoreceptor cell has
also been proposed to occur in the larva of the box jellyfish Tripedalia cystophora, based upon morphology [50].
Pigmented cells in these larvae have rhabdomeric microvilli and a motor cilium, and occur in the absence of a
nervous system. However, opsin expression has not been
shown for these cells, nor has phototactic behavior been
demonstrated for the larvae.
Our results suggest that in Terebratalia middle gastrula stage embryos, c-opsin expressing cells at the anterior of the embryo may be mediating a positive
phototactic response in the absence of discrete shading
pigments or axonal connections between cells. As such,
the Terebratalia gastrula may utilize one of the simplest
systems of directional photoperception and effector
behavior described to date in bilaterians. Additional studies will be required to understand the details of this
phototactic behavior, including the effect of changes in
light intensity on rates of ciliary beating, and the potential role of c-ospin expression in mediating this behavior.

Conclusions
Using both morphological and molecular analyses we
have provided evidence that the larval cerebral eyes of
the brachiopod Terebratalia transversa have ciliary
photoreceptors expressing c-opsin as a photopigment.
The co-expression of Pax6 and Otx in the domains
where the larval eyes will form suggests that the larval
eyes of Terebratalia share common patterning mechanismswith the cerebral eyes of other bilaterians, and may
be homologous to the rhabdomeric larval eyes of other
spiralian taxa. These results suggest that the deployment
of ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptors for directional
photodetection in the Bilateria has been more evolutionarily labile than current hypotheses of eye evolution have
proposed.
The timing and location of early Tt-c-opsin expression
is coincident with a positive photoresponse behavior in

Page 13 of 17

the unpigmented middle gastrula stage embryo prior to
neural differentiation. We propose that c-opsin may facilitate photosensitivity of a simple scanning photoreceptor,
in which phototaxis is facilitated through the autonomous activity of cells that act as both photoreceptors and
ciliated behavioural effectors. This would represent a
very simple system similar to hypothesized intermediates
in the evolution of directional photoreception.

Methods
Animal culture

Gravid adult Terebratalia transversa were obtained at
Friday Harbor Laboratories (San Juan Island, WA,
USA), and in vitro fertilization was performed following
established protocols from Reed [51]. Briefly, gametes
were dissected from gravid animals and ovaries were
macerated through 250 μm Nitex mesh (Sefar Inc,
Depew, NY, USA to separate oocytes. Oocytes were
allowed to settle in a beaker of filtered seawater, washed
several times with filtered seawater, and maintained in a
flow-through sea table until germinal vesicle breakdown
and shedding of follicle cells were observed though a
stereomicroscope (approximately six to eight hours).
Testes were macerated in filtered seawater made alkaline
to pH 9.8 with 1 N sodium hydroxide, and the solution
was monitored on a compound microscope until sperm
became visibly motile (approximately 20 minutes).
A total of 5 ml of sperm solution was added to oocytes
in 250 ml of filtered seawater, and washed out after one
hour. Embryos were collected at different stages up to
the competent larva.
Transmission electron microscopy

Embedded three-lobed stage larvae of Terebratalia transversa (Sowerby, 1846) were kindly provided by Stephen
A. Stricker (Department of Biology, University of New
Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, USA) for further investigation. Details of the fixation process have been published
elsewhere [52]. Ultrathin serial sections of about 70 nm
thickness were cut with a diamond knife on a Leica
Ultracut UCT microtome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany),
subsequently stained with 1% uranyl acetate (50 minutes/
30°C) and lead citrate (25 minutes/25°C) in a Leica EM
Stain and examined with LEO 912 Omega (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and Philips CM 120 Biotwin (FEI,
Eindhoven, The Netherlands) transmission electron
microscopes. Photographs were taken on Kodak EM
4489 negative films digitised with a Silver Fast Mikrotek
ScanMaker 1000 × l (Lasersoft Imaging, Kiel, Germany)
or on Ditabis photoplates digitised on a Ditabis scanner
(DITABIS, Pforzheim, Germany). Digitized photographs
were processed and arranged using Adobe CS3 (Adobe
Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA).

Gene isolation

Fragments of Tt-c-opsin and Tt-Pax6 were amplified by
degenerate PCR using as template complementary DNA
from mixed stages. Degenerate primers for semi-nested
amplification of Tt-c-opsin: WSNTAYATHATHTTYYTITTYRTITTY, forward [6]; GCNTGGWSICCITAYGC,
nested forward; NCKRAAYTGIKTRTTCATIMMIACRTADAT, reverse [6]. Degenerate primers for nested amplification of Tt-Pax6: GTNAAYCARYTNGGNGGNGT,
forward; GTNAAYGGN MGNCCIYTICC, nested forward; RTCNCKDATYTCCCANGCRAA, reverse; TTNG
GYTTNSWNCCNCCDAT, nested reverse. Tt-Otx was
initially identified from an EST clone sequenced for phylogenomic analysis [11]. Full length cDNAs were obtained
by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the SMART
RACE kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Mountain View,
CA, USA). The use of several degenerate primer sets targeted against r-opsin did not lead to the amplification of a
gene fragment.
Whole mount in situ hybridization

In situ hybridizations were carried out using an established protocol [53]. NBT/BCIP stained larvae were
imaged under brightfield Nomarski optics with a Zeiss
Axiocam HR mounted on a Zeiss Axioskop 2 mot plus.
Double label in situ hybridizations were imaged with a
Hamamatsu Orca mounted on a Zeiss Imager Z1. NBT/
BCIP staining was imaged with brightfield illumination
and a 45/Texas Red filter to minimize signal from the
HNPP/FastRed precipitate. HNPP/FastRed staining was
imaged by fluorescence illumination with a 45/Texas
Red filter. The NBT/BCIP image was inverted and falsecolored in ImageJ [54], and the NBT/BCIP and HNPP/
FastRed images where merged to determine regions of
co-expression.
Whole mount fluorescent in situ hybridization

Two-color fluorescent in situ hybridizations were carried out with TSA Plus Fluorescence Kits (PerkinElmer,
Waltham, MA, USA). Fixed larvae with hybridized with

Phylogenetic analysis

The deduced amino acid sequences for Terebratalia
c-opsin, Pax6 and Otx, along with those for representative related proteins from other taxa, retrieved from
NCBI (html://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/; accession numbers
listed below), were aligned with MUSCLE [55]. The
resultant alignments were corrected by eye and nonconserved regions excluded from further analyses. For
each dataset, the best-fit model of protein evolution was
determined with ProtTest [56] and was employed in all
subsequent analyses. For the c-opsin alignment, the
WAG+I+G model was determined to be the best-fit,
while for both Pax6 and Otx the JTT model was the
best-fit. Bayesian likelihood analysis of all datasets was
performed with v3.1.2 of Mr. Bayes [57,58]. For c-opsin,
four independent runs of 5,000,000 generations each
were performed, and a burn-in of 1,000,000 generations
was applied. For Pax6 and Otx, four independent runs
of 2,000,000 generations each were performed, and a
burn-in of 500,000 generations was applied. For all datasets, bootstrap support values were derived from a 1,000
replicate maximum likelihood analysis performed in
PhyML [59].

Photoresponse behavior assay

Middle gastrula stage embryos were placed in a phototaxis
chamber with a 1.7 cm diameter. The chamber was
mounted on a stereo microscope with a red filter over the
transmitted light base. The chamber was agitated prior to
the initiation of transmitted illumination to evenly distribute the embryos. Embryos were exposed to transmitted
red-light illumination for five minutes prior to initiation of
directional illumination. Embryos were then exposed to
lateral directed illumination from a cold white-light source
for 30 minutes, followed by an additional 5 minutes with
only transmitted red-light illumination. Time-lapse images
were required during the entire experiment at a rate of
two frames per second. Distribution and movement of
embryos was measured with ImageJ [52] and Volocity
(PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) software. Embryos
within 1 mm of the sides of the chamber were excluded
measurements to avoid possible edge effects.

Additional file 1: Presumed light-perceptive cilium of the pigment
cell in a larval eye of Terebratalia. (A-I) Series of aligned sections to
illustrate the ciliary membrane forming the stack of membranes (m) in
the optical cavity enclosed by the lens (ls) and the pigment granules
(pg). (J) Close-up of the membrane stack (m) showing the invagination
of the ciliary membrane to enlarge its surface (arrow). (K) Cross-section
of the same cilium showing its 9 × 2 + 2 microtubule pattern. Scale bars:
0.5 μm.
Additional file 2: Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences for
C-terminus of Terebratalia c-opsin and representative c-opsins from
other taxa. Alignment of the of Terebratalia c-opsin C-terminus to the Ctermini of other c-opsins. The conserved C-terminus domain is required
for localization of c-opsin proteins to the ciliary compartment, through
binding to the light chain dynein Tctex-1 [60].
Additional file 3: Middle gastrula swimming prior to directional
illumination. Time lapse imaging of middle gastrula stage embryos
swimming in the phototaxis chamber prior to the initiation of directional
illumination. Embryos are evenly distributed throughout the chamber.
Frame rate is 5× faster than real-time.
Additional file 4: Middle gastrula swimming with directional
illumination. Time lapse imaging of middle gastrula stage embryos
swimming in the phototaxis chamber 20 minutes after the initiation of
directional illumination. Embryos are clustered on the left side of the
chamber, closest to the source of directional illumination. Frame rate is
5× faster than real-time.
Additional file 5: Middle gastrula swimming after directional
illumination. Time lapse imaging of middle gastrula stage embryos
swimming in the phototaxis chamber 10 minutes after the cessation of
directional illumination. Embryos have returned to an even distribution
throughout the chamber. Frame rate is 5× faster than real-time.
