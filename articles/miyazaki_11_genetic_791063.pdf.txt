Abstract
Group A rotaviruses (GARs) are one of the most common causes of diarrhea in suckling pigs. Although a number
of G and P genotypes have been identified in porcine GARs, few attempts have been made to study the molecular
epidemiology of these viruses associated with diarrhea outbreaks within a farm over an extended period of time.
Here, we investigated the molecular characteristics of GARs that caused four outbreaks of diarrhea among suckling
pigs in a farrow-to-finish farm over the course of a year. G and P genotyping of GARs detected at each outbreak
demonstrated genetic diversity in this farm as follows: G9P[23] was detected at the first outbreak, G9P[13]/[22] and
G9P[23] at the second, G3P[7] at the third, and G9P[23], G5P[13]/[22], and P[7] combined with an untypeable G
genotype at the fourth. Sequence analysis of the detected GARs revealed that such genetic diversity could have
resulted not only from the introduction of new GAR strains, but also from gene reassortment between GAR strains
within the farm. Further, the GAR strain carrying the untypeable G genotype was shown to be a novel porcine
GAR bearing a new G26 genotype, as confirmed by the Rotavirus Classification Working Group.
Introduction
Group A rotaviruses (GARs) are the most common etiological agent of severe diarrhea in infants and young children
worldwide, as well as being a common cause of acute enteritis in young farm animals [1]. They are members of the
Rotavirus genus, within the Reoviridae family, and their
genome consists of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA
(dsRNA) encased in a triple-layered capsid. These segments
encode six structural (VP1-VP4, VP6, and VP7) and five or
six non-structural proteins. Amongst these, the outer
capsid proteins VP7 and VP4, which independently elicit
the production of neutralization antibodies, define the G
and P serotypes, and form the basis of a binomial nomenclature [1]. In recent years, the serotype classification system has been almost completely replaced by a genotyping
classification system based on sequence differences of the
respective gene segments [2,3]. Prior to the present study,

at least 25 G genotypes and 33 P genotypes were identified
in humans and animals [4,5]. Among them, at least 11 G
genotypes (G1-G6, G8-G12) and 13 P genotypes (P[1],
P[5]-P[8], P[11], P[13], P[19], P[13]/[22], P[23], P[26],
P[27], and P[32]) have been described in pigs [6-11].
The zoonotic potential of animal GARs is a great concern [12]. GARs with unusual G genotypes commonly
found in pigs and cattle have been detected in sporadic
and epidemic cases of diarrhea in human populations
[13-18]. A full genome-based genotyping system proposed
by Matthijnssens et al. revealed the existence of reassortant strains and the close relationship between human and
animal strains [2,3]. In addition, a number of new G and P
genotypes have recently been identified in animals
[4,5,7,19,20]. In light of these findings, animal GARs have
come to be regarded as a potential reservoir for genetic
diversity in human GARs, and studying them is therefore
critical for understanding the evolution and ecology of
human GARs.
Besides their zoonotic potential, as the most frequently
detected enteropathogen associated with diarrhea among

suckling pigs, GARs also pose an economic threat to the
pig industry due to poor growth performance, and
increased morbidity and mortality rates [21,22]. Given
the present lack of a commercially available vaccine for
GAR-associated diarrhea in Japan, the only means of prevention has been hygiene management. However,
although effectively managing GAR infections requires
an ecological understanding of GARs, few attempts have
been made to examine the molecular epidemiology of
porcine GARs associated with diarrhea within a farm
over an extended length of time. We therefore investigated the genotypic characteristics of GARs causing
repeated outbreaks of diarrhea among suckling pigs in a
farrow-to-finish farm over the course of a year.

RT-PCR

The GAR VP7 gene and the VP8* fragment of the VP4
gene were amplified using a QIAGEN OneStep RT-PCR
kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) with primer pairs Beg9/
End9 and Con2/Con3, respectively [24,25]. RT-PCR was
conducted to detect group B and C rotaviruses (GBRs and
GCRs), transmissible gastroenteritis virus, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, and porcine sapovirus as described
previously [26-30]. The amplicons were analyzed in 2%
agarose gel electrophoresis and visualized by UV after ethidium bromide staining.
DNA sequencing and genetic analysis

Bacteriological examinations were carried out for Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Clostridium perfringens, and parasitological examinations were carried out
for Coccidia and Cryptosporidium parvum, as described
previously [21].

The amplicons of the GAR VP7 and VP4 genes were purified using MicroSpin S-400 HR Columns (GE Healthcare,
Uppsala, Sweden). The purified PCR products were used
as a template for sequencing on an Applied Biosystems
3100 automated DNA sequencer using Dye terminator
cycle sequencing chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) and sequenced from both directions. To
determine the complete coding region of the VP7 gene of
a TJ4-1 strain, primers TJ4-1 494F (5’-GTA ACC CAA
TGG ACA TTA CAC TG-3’) and TJ4-1 368R (5’-CTA
CTG AAA ATG ATG CGA TGT C-3’) were also used as
sequencing primers. The sequences were assembled, edited, and analyzed using MEGA 4 software [31]. The
nucleotide sequences of the VP7 and VP4 genes from the
detected GARs were compared with those of reference
strains available in the GenBank. Multiple nucleotide
sequence alignments were carried out using the CLUSTAL
W algorithm. Genetic distances were calculated using the
Kimura-2 correction parameter, and phylogenic dendrograms were constructed by the neighbor-joining method
with 1 000 bootstrap replications [2].

RNA extraction

Nucleotide sequence accession numbers

Fecal specimens were diluted with Eagle’s minimum
essential medium to 10% suspensions and clarified by centrifugation at 1 500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was
collected and total RNA was extracted from 250 μL of the
fecal suspensions using TRIzol LS (Invitrogen Corp.,
Carlsbad, CA, USA). Recovered total RNA was suspended
in 50 μL of RNase/DNase-free water and stored at -20°C
until use for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE).

The nucleotide sequences determined in this study have
been submitted to GenBank under the following accession
numbers: TJ1-1 (VP7:AB611688, VP4: AB621582); TJ2-1
(VP7:AB611689, VP4:AB621587); TJ2-2 (VP7:AB611690,
VP4:AB621583); TJ3-2 (VP7:AB611692, VP4:AB621585);
TJ4-1(VP7:AB605258, VP4:AB621586); TJ4-3 (VP4:
AB611691, VP4:AB621584); TJ4-5 (VP7:AB611693, VP4:
AB621588).

Materials and methods
Fecal samples

Outbreaks of epidemic diarrhea occurred among suckling
pigs four times between February 2009 and March 2010 at
a large farrow-to-finish farm with 4000 sows located in the
Miyazaki prefecture, Japan. A total of 28 fecal samples
(one sample per litter, 5 to 11 samples per outbreak) were
collected from the rectum of diarrheal pigs that had not
been treated with antibiotics. All animal experiments were
approved by the Animal Ethical Committee and the
Animal Care and Use Committee of National Institute of
Animal Health.
Bacteriological and parasitological examination

Results
Four outbreaks of GAR-associated diarrhea

RNA-PAGE

PAGE of the extracted RNA was performed with 7.5%
precast gels (e-PAGEL; Atto Corp., Tokyo, Japan). The
gels were stained using a Silver Stain Plus kit (Bio-Rad
Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). GAR electropherotypes were determined by comparing the individual RNA
migration patterns of genome segments on the gel [23].

Epidemic outbreaks of diarrhea affecting almost all
suckling pigs born to 20% to 30% of lactating sows
occurred in February, March, and May 2009, and March
2010. Common clinical signs included profuse watery
diarrhea and dehydration lasting about one week. Mortality rates were less than 5%. Age and sow parity of the
sampled pigs are summarized in Table 1. While no

All 11 segments of GAR genomic RNA were visualized in
22 samples out of the 28 samples subjected to RNA-PAGE.
These RNA migration patterns were classified into six electropherotypes designated eI to eVI (Figure 1). All electropherotypes displayed a long migration pattern resembling
that of the porcine OSU strain (a reference porcine GAR
strain). A different electropherotype was observed in each
outbreak, as summarized in Table 2. RNA-PAGE found no

third and fourth outbreaks mostly affected pigs less than
seven days old that were born to gilts.
More than 80% of the samples collected at each outbreak were positive for GARs, as determined by RTPCR targeting VP7, and are listed in Table 2. A small
minority of samples contained other enteropathogens:
GBR was detected in two samples at the first outbreak,
Isospora suis and Eimeria porci were detected in one
sample at the second outbreak, and GCR was detected

Figure 1 Electropherotypes (eI to eVI) of GAR strains detected
at each of the four diarrhea outbreaks in a farrow-to-finish
farm from February 2009 to March 2010. OSU is a reference
porcine GAR strain with a long RNA migration pattern.

G5 OSU strain’s VP7 gene) were successfully determined
in 15 samples. BLAST search analysis and phylogenic
analysis of these VP7 genes with those of 25 established
G genotypes led to classification of the 15 GAR strains
into four genotypes: G9, G3, G5, and an untypeable G
genotype (Figure 2a).
Eleven G9 strains were identified in this study, with
eight strains detected at the first outbreak, two at the second, and one at the fourth (Table 2). A phylogenic tree
based on a selection of human and animal G9 strains was
generated as described by Collins et al. [32]. These eleven
strains constituted a separate branch distantly related to
human and porcine G9 strains comprising G9 lineages III
and VI (Figure 2b). Nucleotide identities for the eleven
strains were 99.4% to 100% compared to each other, 90.6%
to 93.2% to the old Japanese porcine G9 isolates JP16-3,
JP32-4, JP13-3, JP35-7, JP3-6, JP29-6, and Hokkaido-14
that belong to G9 lineage VI, and 87.2% to 93.8% to
human and porcine G9 strains belonging to G9 lineages
III and VI (Figure 2b and Additional file 1, Table S1).
The two G3 strains TJ3-1 and TJ3-2, both of which were
identified at the third outbreak, constituted a separate
branch distantly related to porcine G3 strains, comprising
lineage I (Figure 2c) [33]. The nucleotide identities of their
VP7 genes were 100% compared to each other, 87.6% to
91.6% to the porcine G3 strains comprising lineage I,
87.3% to 90.9% to human G3 strains comprising lineage I,

Page 4 of 10

and 79.1% to 82.4% to the G3 strains comprising other
lineages (Figure 2c and Additional file 1, Table S1).
The G5 isolate TJ4-5, identified at the fourth outbreak,
constituted a separate branch distantly related to human
and porcine G5 strains comprising lineage III (Figure 2d)
[34]. The nucleotide identities of its VP7 gene were 86.3%
to 90.3% compared to the G5 strains comprising lineage
III, 85.4% to 87.4% to lineage I, and 85.3% to 87.6% to lineage II (Figure 2d and Additional file 1, Table S1).
Phylogenic analysis revealed that the untypeable G genotype strain TJ4-1, identified at the fourth outbreak, did not
cluster with any reference sequence from the group of 25
G genotypes (Figure 2a). In a BLAST search analysis, the
nucleotide identities of its VP7 gene were 93.1% compared
to 57vp7w, the uncommon human G3 strain identified in
Thailand (736 bp, [GenBank:DQ674932]) [35], up to
80.5% to other G3 strains, and up to 78.8% to the strains
of other G genotypes. We therefore characterized the TJ41 strain by analyzing the complete coding sequence of the
VP7 gene, which turned out to be 981-bp long and
included a predicted protein of 326 amino acids. We compared the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences
with those from the reference strains of the 25 established
G genotypes (Table 3) and found that the highest identity
was to the G3 RRV strain (80.2% nucleotide identity and
87.5% amino acid identity), with lower nucleotide and
amino acid identities to other strains ranging from 61.1%
to 78.1%, and 57.2% to 85.5%, respectively. The Rotavirus
Classification Working Group (RCWG) employs a cutoff
value of 80% nucleotide identity to define a novel G genotype [3], and on submitting the sequence to the RCWG, it
was subsequently assigned as a new G genotype: G26.
Genetic analysis of the VP8* fragment of GAR VP4 genes

The nucleotide sequences of the VP8* fragment of the
VP4 genes (774 bp, corresponding to nucleotides
70 through 843 of the porcine P[7] OSU strain’s VP4
gene) were successfully determined in 13 of 15 samples
in which the VP7 gene sequences had been previously
determined. BLAST search analysis and phylogenic analysis of these VP4 genes with those of 33 established P
genotypes led to classification of the 13 GAR strains into
three genotypes: P[23], P[7], and P[13]/[22] (Table 2).
Eight P[23] strains were identified, with six strains
detected at the first outbreak, one at the second, and
one at the fourth (Table 2). These strains had nucleotide
identities of 99.7% to 100% compared to each other,
91.0% to the porcine GUB71 strain identified in Japan,
and 85.6% to 89.7% to other porcine P[23] strains
(Additional file 2, Table S2).
Two P[7] strains (TJ3-1 and TJ3-2) were identified at
the third outbreak and one (TJ4-1) at the fourth, having
99.7% to 100% sequence identities with each other.
They were clustered in one branch related to the

porcine OSU strain and in another to porcine and
bovine P[7] strains (isolated in China and Korea respectively) with 86.4% to 94.5% nucleotide identity (Figure 3
and Additional file 2, Table S2).
In contrast, one P[13]/[22] strain identified at the second
outbreak (TJ2-1) and one at the fourth (TJ4-5) showed low
nucleotide identity (80.3%) with each other (Additional file
2, Table S2). The TJ2-1 strain belonged to a lineage comprised of porcine P[13] strains of Japanese origin (GUB72,
FGP28 and FGP36) and global origin (CMP178 and
HP140) with 83.3% to 84.6% nucleotide identity (Figure 3
and Additional file 2, Table S2). The TJ4-5 strain was clustered with the porcine P[13]/[22] strains of Ireland origin
(2B/05/Ire) and Japanese origin (JP35-7 and JP13-3) with
89.0% nucleotide identity (Figure 3 and Additional file 2,
Table S2).
Combinations of G and P genotypes of GAR strains
detected in the four outbreaks of diarrhea

Based on the sequence and phylogenic analysis of GAR
strains detected among the four outbreaks, at least five

combinations of G and P genotypes (G/P combinations)
were identified: G9P[23] at the first outbreak, G9P[13]/
[22] and G9P[23] at the second, G3P[7] at the third,
and G26P[7], G9P[23], and G5P[13]/[22] at the fourth
(Table 2).
Although the VP7 genes from the G9P[23] and G9P
[13]/[22] strains were closely related to each other
genetically, they combined with different P genotypes.
Similarly, the VP4 genes from the G3P[7] and G26P[7]
strains were highly homologous, yet they combined with
different G genotypes.

Discussion
Based on fecal analyses, we demonstrated that the cause
behind repeated outbreaks of diarrhea among suckling
pigs over a one-year period was primarily GAR infection.
Sequence and phylogenic analysis of the VP7 and VP4
genes from detected GARs identified a spectrum of G
and P genotypes, including G3, G5, G9, P[7], P[13]/[22],
and P[23]. In addition, we identified the TJ4-1 strain,
which contained a new VP7 genotype G26, as confirmed

and assigned by the RCWG. Although the detected G
and P genotypes (excluding G26) were common in pig
populations worldwide [8,32,36,37], the strains identified
in this study displayed marked genetic variation when
compared to others around the world as well as older
Japanese strains, suggesting genetic variability in GAR
strains circulating in the pig population of Japan.
Several limitations to the present study warrant mention. Not only was the total number of samples low, but
also, roughly half of them could not be successfully analyzed for either the VP7 or VP4 genes. However, despite
these limitations, we found at least five different G/P combinations and six electropherotypes during the four outbreaks, indicating considerable genetic diversity of GAR
strains within a farm continuing over one year. Co-circulation of different GAR strains in the same herd has also
been reported in several studies: Collins et al. identified at
least 2 to 6 GAR strains among asymptomatic pigs in each
farm at a same time [32], and Barreiros et al. detected at
least three strains during a diarrhea outbreak on a single
swine farm [38]. While such genetic diversity in the same
herd may have resulted from the introduction of new
GAR strains, our results support the additional possibility
of genetic reassortment between GAR strains within the
herd. Indeed, the G9P[23] and G9P[13]/[22] strains contained almost identical G9 sequences, and the G3P[7] and
G26P[7] strains had nearly identical P[7] sequences.
A previous study has shown that herds with GAR-associated diarrhea tend to be managed in an all-in all-out system and to have large numbers of sows [39]. Because
diarrhea occurs in pigs when the oral challenge level of
GAR exceeds the protective level of passive immunity
acquired through colostrum and milk, the onset age and
diarrhea severity are influenced by management practices
that affect these factors, such as housing type, sanitation,
and crate design [40]. By maintaining strict sanitation
management and housing sows and gilts in separate units
(about 4 000 sows were kept in 8 gestation and 14 farrowing barns), the farm in the present study might reduce the
uniformity of exposure levels and immunity to GARs. The
variation in affected pigs across the outbreaks appears to
reflect the variation in the level of lactogenic immunity
passed from sows to piglets (Table 1). Therefore, it cannot
be ruled out that differing immunity levels among sows or
gilts may be associated with the existence of the genetically
diverse GAR strains and the repeated diarrhea outbreaks.
Based on accumulated evidence, it is clear that GARs
can transfer between pigs and humans, making pigs a
potential reservoir for the emergence of unusual or novel
strains of human GARs [13-18]. In fact, the novel G26
strain we found was most similar to the human 57vp7w
strain, which can also be considered to be a G26 strain.
The 57vp7w strain was reported as a rare G3P[19]
human strain identified in a clinical sample collected in

Page 8 of 10

Thailand between 2004 and 2006 [35]. Although the origin of G26 remains unclear, the VP4 sequence of 57vp7w
[GenBank: DQ674935] is genetically closely related to
those of porcine P[19] strains detected in Thailand [6].
Further, genetic analysis of several genome segments of
the TJ4-1 strain other than VP4 and VP7 revealed that,
except for the VP7 gene, this strain shares a similar
genetic background with the porcine YM strain [Miyazaki A, in preparation]. Taken together, these findings
suggest that 57vp7w may be a porcine-human reassortant
or a porcine strain. Considering that the newly identified
G26 has been detected in both pigs and humans, and the
scarcity of animal GAR strains in the genetic database,
further surveillance and epidemiological study on GARs
in domestic animals will be needed to better understand
the origin and circulation of human GARs.
Here, we demonstrated the genetic diversity of GARs
associated with repeated outbreaks of diarrhea among
suckling pigs within a farm over a one-year period. Such
genetic diversity within a single farm might pose a challenge for developing effective methods of prevention
against diarrhea caused by GAR infection.
