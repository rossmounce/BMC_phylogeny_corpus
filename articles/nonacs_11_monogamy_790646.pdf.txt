Monogamy and high relatedness do not
preferentially favor the evolution of cooperation
Peter Nonacs

Abstract
Background: Phylogenetic analyses strongly associate nonsocial ancestors of cooperatively-breeding or eusocial
species with monogamy. Because monogamy creates high-relatedness family groups, kin selection has been
concluded to drive the evolution of cooperative breeding (i.e., the monogamy hypothesis). Although kin selection
is criticized as inappropriate for modeling and predicting the evolution of cooperation, there are no examples
where specific inclusive fitness-based predictions are intrinsically wrong. The monogamy hypothesis may be the
first case of such a flawed calculation.
Results: A simulation model mutated helping alleles into non-cooperative populations where females mated either
once or multiply. Although multiple mating produces sibling broods of lower relatedness, it also increases the
likelihood that one offspring will adopt a helper role. Examining this tradeoff showed that under a wide range of
conditions polygamy, rather than monogamy, allowed helping to spread more rapidly through populations. Further
simulations with mating strategies as heritable traits confirmed that multiple-mating is selectively advantageous.
Although cooperation evolves similarly regardless of whether dependent young are close or more distant kin, it
does not evolve if they are unrelated.
Conclusions: The solitary ancestral species to cooperative breeders may have been predominantly monogamous,
but it cannot be concluded that monogamy is a predisposing state for the evolution of helping behavior.
Monogamy may simply be coincidental to other more important life history characteristics such as nest defense or
sequential provisioning of offspring. The differing predictive outcome from a gene-based model also supports
arguments that inclusive fitness formulations poorly model some evolutionary questions. Nevertheless, cooperation
only evolves when benefits are provided for kin: helping alleles did not increase in frequency in the absence of
potential gains in indirect fitness. The key question, therefore, is not whether kin selection occurs, but how best to
elucidate the differing evolutionary advantages of genetic relatedness versus genetic diversity.

Background
Cooperatively breeding groups often have two defining
characteristics: increased productivity over solitary individuals and differential within-group reproductive success or skew [1]. One puzzling feature of reproductive
inequality is that subordinate roles appear to be willingly
accepted. Kin selection is the dominant evolutionary
paradigm for this apparent reproductive altruism [2-5].
In groups of relatives, an individual reducing its reproduction can be favored if this sufficiently benefits
genetic kin. Increasingly, however, the relative importance of genetic relatedness for the evolution of

reproductive skew is being questioned [1,6-8]. If groups
are sufficiently successful, then individual genetic differences creating within-group reproductive skew can be
evolutionarily stable [9]. Alternatively, parental manipulation can bias offspring to assume otherwise reproductively disadvantageous roles [10-12]. If such groups
remain intact over generations of shared reproduction,
then high relatedness may be a consequence and not a
cause of cooperation. Indeed, Wilson and others argue
kin selection acts more often as a ‘dissolutive’ than a
binding force within groups [6-8].
The proposed alternatives to kin selection for reproductive skew have been challenged on both theoretical
and empirical grounds [2-5]. The importance of kin
selection in the evolution of cooperative breeding is

Results
Helping allele (A) is dominant

Relative generation to 50%

Cooperation evolves under intermediate values of adult
survival between offspring cohorts. If s is less than 0.78
or 0.40 for cohort sizes of 1 or 5 respectively, helping
never predominates in the population (Figure 1). Similarly, if s = 1 such that mothers do not die between
cohorts, there is no selective advantage to making or
being a helper. With no maternal mortality, helping
behavior does not invade the population in the model
(Figure 1).

argued to be particularly evident in its taxonomic distribution with respect to mating strategy. By Hamilton’s
rule, helping a relative is selectively favored when relatedness exceeds the cost/benefit ratio, or r >c/b. With
monogamy, helping a parent rear full siblings is as valuable as rearing one’s own offspring (r = 0.5 for both,
where r is the probability of an allele being identical by
descent through a common ancestor). Therefore, any
reduction in cost or increase in benefit favors helping. In
contrast, polygamy in terms of multiple fathers produces
half sibs (r = 0.25) and cooperation would require halving
costs or doubling benefits. Thus, kin selection predicts
the evolution of cooperation ought to be most likely in
species preadapted to maintain high relatedness between
siblings (i.e., the monogamy hypothesis) [13,14]. Monogamy and high relatedness were first proposed to be critical in evolutionary transitions in social insects from
cooperative breeding with totipotent individuals, to eusocial systems with morphological queen and worker castes
[13,14]. Two recent phylogenetic analyses have extended
the monogamy hypothesis to cooperative breeding, per
se. Monogamy or lower levels of promiscuity are the
most likely ancestral state for evolutionary transitions
from solitary to social living in hymenoptera [15] and
birds [16]. Conversely, lack of monogamy is hypothesized
as evolutionarily constraining social degus (Octodon
degu) from more elaborate sociality as exhibited by other
group-living rodents such as naked mole rats [17].
Nowak et al. [6] challenged the monogamy hypothesis
for social hymenoptera on two grounds. Specifically, the
phylogenetic evidence is weak because the ancestral
state of the majority of solitary hymenoptera species is
likely to be monogamy. Hence, monogamy as an evolutionary preadaptation is indistinguishable from ecological factors favoring cooperation, such as defending nests
or sequentially provisioning offspring. More broadly, the
entire approach of inclusive fitness modeling may be rife
with simplifying assumptions that produce spurious predictions. Rather than the actor-based approach of kin
selection (e.g., do individuals have higher inclusive fitness for helping parents or raising their own offspring?),
Nowak et al. [6] advocated a gene-based approach (e.g.,
can alleles for helping others reproduce invade noncooperative populations?). They derived general cases
showing that r values alone may not always accurately
predict the evolution of cooperation. However, they
gave no example of a specific behavioral or life history
phenomenon where a kin selection model gives an erroneous prediction relative to a gene-based model [18].
The monogamy hypothesis is where kin selection possibly gets it wrong. If its basic premise of an inclusive
fitness advantage to helping with high relatedness is correct, then the same result ought to occur when cooperation is modeled as the spread of a helping allele.

the helping allele equaled or exceeded 50% of the population are
shown as ratios relative to single mating for 1 (black line), 2 (blue)

the black line, helping evolves faster with monogamy. Where they
are less than the black line, helping increases more rapidly with
polygamy. Regions of the graphs where individual lines do not
extend indicate conditions where A never increased to the 50%

Under conditions that do favor helping, the monogamy
hypothesis is not confirmed by a gene-based approach:
helping does not consistently evolve more quickly with
monogamy (Figure 1). Under many conditions, the number of mates does not affect how rapidly helping spreads
through the population. The gene-based modeling
approach reveals the reason. Any aa female mating with
multiple males increases her chances of gaining a helper.
However, helpers aid a relatively smaller fraction of sibs
with A. These two probabilities approximately cancel
out. From the helping allele perspective, single mating is
a high variance strategy that pays off big, but rarely. Multiple mating is a low variance strategy that works more
often, but with reduced effect.
There are associated advantages and disadvantages
with mating strategy that are separate from differences
in sibling relatedness. An advantage for single mating is
that helpers aid both alleles equally. For example, all
daughters from aa x A matings are aA. Thus, the frequency of A in helpers equals the frequency of A in
aided female siblings. In contrast, if aa females mate
multiply with males of both genotypes, then the frequency of A is higher in helping females than in helped
ones. Although A can increase in the population due to
across-group selection, it decreases in frequency within
its own group. When inter-cohort survival is low, this
cost to multiple mating results in helping evolving faster
with monogamy (Figure 1).
Multiple mating has an advantage that if mothers die,
subsequent benefits nonrandomly accrue to A alleles.
Only daughters having this allele can inherit nests. As
inter-cohort survival increases, helping becomes more
likely to evolve with polygamy and through groups of
lower mean relatedness. Interestingly, polygamy is
favored over a wider range of values than monogamy
(Figure 1).
Mating strategy is uniform across females within a
population in the above results. However, when females
are randomly assigned a number of mates (1 or 5)
within the same population, multiply-mated nests consistently produce more offspring relative to singly-mated
nests across a wide range of s values (Figure 2). The difference is particularly evident when A is the rarer allele.
Only when A reaches high frequencies, such as 75% of
the population, is nest productivity similar across mating
strategies.
When mating strategies are themselves genetically determined, alleles for higher mating frequency are favored
(Figure 3). Because polygamous nests produce more helping daughters, this in turn increases lifetime nest productivity (Figure 2) and the potential transmission of alleles
for multiple mating. This advantage disappears at higher
frequencies of the helping allele because all mating strategies are likely to produce helpers (Figure 3). Interestingly,

with low survival values (e.g., s = 0.5) cooperation evolves
much more rapidly in monogamous rather than polygamous populations (Figure 1B), but polygamous nests
are on average more productive within populations
(Figure 2B) and multiple mating alleles are at a selective
advantage when helping is not ubiquitous (Figure 3).
Therefore, the evolution of helping appears to always have
the correlated effect of also favoring mating with multiple
potential fathers.
Helping allele (A) is recessive or males are diploid

Helping behavior evolves more slowly when A is recessive because the allele must initially drift under neutral
selection until its frequency is high enough that AA
daughters start being produced. Apart from this, the
results are broadly similar to when A is dominant
(Figure 4). Monogamy is favored when s is low, equal to
polygamy when s is intermediate, and disfavored when s
is high. Also similar to when A is dominant, monogamous nests are, on average, less productive when A is
rare in the population (Figure 5). Recessive alleles differ
in that multiple mating has the greatest relative selective

likely due to helping rarely expressed at low frequencies

qualitatively different effects on the results and conclusions (Figure 6 & 7).

Indirect fitness and multiple helpers

When helpers randomly drift across nests, kin and nonkin are equally likely to benefit from survival insurance.
In the absence of indirect fitness gains for biasing survival insurance towards kin, A does not increase in frequency beyond levels produced by mutation and genetic
drift (Figure 8). Across every simulation with all levels
of adult survival, the A allele never reached a frequency
of 50% or more in the population.
Allowing multiple helpers, each of which provides an
identical increase in nest survivorship, does not result in
helping spreading more rapidly with monogamy than
polygamy. Under conditions where A is dominant and
offspring come in cohorts of five, the helping allele
reaches a population frequency of 50%, on average, in
56.7, 35.0 or 23.8 generations (with s = 0.7, 0.75, or 0.8,
respectively) with monogamy. In comparison, the helping allele reaches the 50% criterion in 37.2, 23.9 and
18.7 generations when females mate with two males.
When mating with five males, the 50% criterion is
attained in 22.4, 18.4 and 15.6 generations. Thus across
this range of comparison, the 50% criterion is reached

in 39-79% of the number of generations required under
monogamy. Contrasted to the results with only one
helper (Figure 1B), polygamy is even more conducive to
the spread of helping behavior when multiple helpers
increase nest survival in an additive, linear fashion.

Discussion
Monogamous behavior on the part of females in mating
with only one male does not appear to generally act as a
spring-loaded preadaptation for the evolution of cooperative breeding. To the contrary, polygamy through
polyandry is more likely to be particularly beneficial.
Although phylogenetic signals may correlate monogamy
with eusociality and reproductive skew [13-16], such
relationships are not prima facie support for kin selection theory. Other shared life history traits apart from
mating behavior must be reconsidered as predisposing
factors for evolution of cooperative breeding [6]. Indeed,
the more interesting message in the phylogenetic data
may be how often social systems of low relatedness have
evolved (e.g., becoming polygynous or polyandrous)

from high-relatedness ancestral species. For example,
polyandry appears to have evolved independently from
monoandry in 22 clades of ants [15]. Groups of low
relatedness are likely to have correlated benefits arising
from increased group-level genetic diversity, and it
appears these benefits often exceed the evolutionary
advantages of high within-group relatedness [9].
The contradiction of the monogamy hypothesis by a
gene-based model supports criticism that inclusive fitness models are potentially inaccurate [6]. There are
two reasons, however, why these results do not contradict kin selection, per se. First, comparing rearing offspring versus rearing full or half sibs in deriving the
monogamy hypothesis is overly simplistic. This fails to
include a long chain of probabilities of outcomes. For
example, the true fitness payoff for a daughter in helping must include: the probability of surviving her
mother across each potential remaining offspring cohort;
if she does survive her mother, the probability that she
herself will recruit a helper (which will depend on her
mating strategy and the current frequency of A in the
population); the subsequent probability(ies) that she will
in turn be superseded by her daughter; etc. This value
must be compared to a similarly extensive calculation of
fitness for leaving. Note also that this is from daughter’s
‘point of view’. The payoffs would be different if asking
whether the mother should manipulate a daughter into
helping. Thus a gene-based model might indeed predict

the same result as a fully comprehensive inclusive fitness
model. Nevertheless, a gene-based approach is clearly a
much simpler and more robust approach to this question. The stochastic simulations include every possible
series of outcomes weighted by their probability of
occurrence. None of these have to be calculated a priori.
The model also has no ‘point of view’ that requires specifying the differential effects on parent and offspring
fitness. If costs to offspring exceed benefits for parents
(or vice versa), then reproductive suppression will not
be selectively advantageous.
The second reason is more fundamental than a choice
of analytical approaches. Although helping often
increases more rapidly with lowered relatedness in the
gene-based model, positive kin assortment is still
required. Even with five fathers, relatedness would not
be random (i.e., r > 0, with r being a measure of positive
assortment such that members of the same nest are
more likely to share the A allele than individuals drawn

randomly from the population). Therefore, helpers can
gain both direct fitness from inheriting their mother’s
position as reproducing adult and indirect fitness
through assuring the survival of half and full sibs. Randomly redistributing helpers as if they were drifting to
join nests creates a situation where the helpers have a
mean expectation of r = 0 in terms of kin assortment to
the present brood. Helping, therefore, can be selected
only through direct fitness gains from future nest inheritance. Removing any potential for kin selection prevents
helping from increasing in frequency (Figure 8). Thus, a
gene-based approach is also a variation on Hamilton’s
rule. The basic principle remains unchanged: reproductive altruism evolves only when kin are sufficiently and
differentially benefitted.

Conclusion
Gene-based models may be superior to actor-based, kin
selection models with variance in outcomes or when fitness consequences vary across interacting individuals.
Thus more clearly than an inclusive fitness approach,
the gene-based approach demonstrates that monogamy
does not intrinsically create conditions predisposed for
the evolution of helping. Gene-based approaches have
also successfully modeled the evolution of genetic

diversity through across-individual epistatic effects (i.e.,
social heterosis [9,19]). One must not, however, confuse
the utility of a particular mathematical approach with
the validity of the underlying evolutionary theory. Showing low relatedness is selectively advantageous to high
relatedness is not equivalent to concluding that relatedness is unimportant. Actor-based models of kin selection have had a long and fruitful history of framing
interesting evolutionary questions [2-5] and will
undoubtedly continue to be successful in explaining
many features of life history. Kin selection theory is
important because kinship mattered throughout evolutionary history. The key point is that genetic relatedness
and genetic diversity are inversely correlated and the
evolutionary consequences of this correlation are what
future modeling endeavors should aim to better
understand.

Methods
The model is written in TrueBasic®, with code provided
in Additional File 1 for the main model. Populations
were initially modeled as haplodiploid with a wasp-like
life history. In the first generation 200 solitarily-nesting
females, all homozygous for non-helping (genotype aa),

Nonacs BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:58
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/58

mated to either 1, 2, or 5 males. To be consistent with
terminology used elsewhere, departures from monogamy
are equated only with mating status (monoandry versus
polyandry). I do not consider the case of multiple
females breeding simultaneously (i.e., polygyny in social
insects). Each mother could produce a maximum of 50
offspring. Offspring were produced sequentially either
one at a time or in groups of five. Sex of each offspring
was randomly chosen and equally likely to be female or
male. Between each successive reproductive event,
mothers had an expected survival rate of s (varied
between 0.3 to 1.0, depending on the simulation). Offspring survival required at least one adult on the nest
until their cohort matured. Without an adult, any
remaining offspring died. Mature offspring either
became helpers or were seeded into a common reproductive pool for the next generation.
For each offspring, the maternal allele contribution
was randomly chosen with equal probability. If the offspring was female, the father was randomly chosen from
the mother’s mates. All sons, irrespective of genotype,
became reproductives. All aa daughters (and aA daughters if A was recessive) became reproductives. The first
aA daughter produced (AA if recessive) became a helper
on the nest. The only exception was for the last possible
cohort (i.e., where the nest reaches the maximum of 50
offspring). At this point, there is no possibility to provide help and all daughters were added to the common
reproductive pool. Although this behavior is framed as
beneficial ‘helping’ from a daughter, the model is the
same if A is defined as a susceptibility to being manipulated into remaining by the mother. Neither mothers,
fathers nor helpers were added to the common reproductive pool. Each generation was a new sample of
potential parents and helpers.
Helping arose in the form of mutation from allele a to
A. The mutation rate was 0.001 per generation for every
allele in sons and non-helper daughters. Because the
main variable of interest was the rate at which helping
spread due to mating strategy, back mutations were not
relevant and, therefore, were not considered in the
simulations.
Only one helper could be present on a given nest at a
time in most simulations because survival benefits tend
to rapidly decline with helper number [20]. The helper’s
inter-cohort survival rate was the same as her mother’s.
This assumes there are no ‘queen-like’ preadaptations in
mothers to reduce foraging or otherwise increase their
own survival rates. Helpers did not reproduce in the
presence of their mother, and mothers did not increase
cohort size or maximum cohort numbers with helpers.
These assumptions follow the headstart or assured fitness return models of cooperation where the helper’s
benefit for the mother and her siblings is for potential

nest survival if the mother should die [21,22]. If both
mother and helper were present, all other daughters
entered the common reproductive pool. If the mother
survived and the helper died during some interval, a
new helper could be recruited. If the mother died and
the helper survived, the helper became the new mother
on the nest and mated with the same number of males
as her mother. The following cohort of offspring was
still the previous mother’s, but the subsequent cohort
was the offspring of the promoted helper. Again, a new
helper could be potentially recruited. Sequential monogyny with the death and replacement of a single dominant egg-layer are common life histories in primitively
eusocial species [23]. Nest inheritance and mating by
helpers created totipotence for all individuals in the
model. There was no permanently sterile caste, and as
such this appears to violate the initial premise of the
monogamy hypothesis. Boomsma [5,6] proposes that a
‘monogamy window’ is evolutionarily needed for transition from cooperative breeding to full eusociality with
division of labor across castes in social insects. However,
even in highly eusocial species, workers will often reproduce after the death of the queen [24,25], which was
what happened in this model. Thus the reproductive life
history modeled here would apply to both cooperativelybreeding and eusocial species.
The next generation was initiated after reproduction
was tallied across all nests. Two hundred new females
and the appropriate number of mates were randomly
chosen from the common reproductive pool. This pool
was then discarded, to be filled again from the new generation of nests. Each simulation ran until either a predetermined frequency of helping was reached (e.g., A
composes 50% of the population). If the target frequency
level was not reached in 500 generations, the simulation
was terminated with the conclusion that helping was
selectively disadvantaged. Each set of conditions was
simulated 100 times. One complication was that as A
reaches higher frequencies, drawing out females to be
daughter helpers biases the reproductive pool towards
males. To counter this, I included an increasing initial
sex biasing factor such that each offspring produced had
a slightly increased probability of being female (e.g.,
52-54% female). Because most of the analyzed results
examine the initial change in the frequency of A, the
biasing correction factor has a trivial effect. The simulations were repeated as described under cases where A is
recessive or males are diploid. In the latter case, each
offspring had a randomly chosen father (if mothers were
polygamous), and its contributed allele to the offspring
was randomly chosen.
The above simulations compared the rate of increase
of helping in populations that differed in the number of
matings per female. Within populations, all females

mated the same number of times. To examine withinpopulation advantages for mating number, I used two
methods to compare the fitness. In both maternal mating strategy was randomly assigned as having 1 or 5
mates. Daughters that inherited nests mated with the
same number of males as their mother. In the first
method, fitness was calculated as the total number of
offspring produced on a nest where females mated
either once or five times. This method determined
whether monogamous or polygamous nests were intrinsically more productive as helping spread through the
population. However, differences in reproductive output
may not necessarily translate to differential selection on
mating number itself because mating preference was not
heritable. Therefore in a second method, I started with
populations having fixed frequencies of a dominant A
allele ranging between 0.05 and 0.95, randomly distributed across individuals. In this case mothers also varied
genotypically for mating strategy with alleles specified
for mating with 1 or 5 males. At the beginning of each
simulation, each allele was set at 50% of the initial
population. A mother’s expressed mating strategy was
the rounded average of her two alleles (e.g., a mother
with alleles for mating once or five times, mated with
three males). Nests reproduced as described above for
one generation and alleles contributed to the next generation’s reproductive pool were tallied for each mating
strategy.
Another model variation eliminated the possibility of
helpers gaining indirect fitness by helping kin. In these
simulations, all individuals that became helpers were
randomly distributed across surviving nests for every
cohort of offspring produced across all mothers. Biologically, this is as if helpers drift within the population and
randomly associate with any other nest. In this situation
the average helper is unrelated to the individuals on the
nest she joins. Although such a system of completely
random, drifting helpers has never been observed, this
variation serves an important function for understanding
the model results. In the above scenarios, helping has
both indirect fitness returns (i.e., assuring survival of
non-descendant kin) and direct fitness (i.e., the possibility of inheriting a nest and rearing own offspring). With
drifting helpers, only direct fitness returns to the potential helper can select for helping behavior.
A final variation of the model allowed up to four helpers
to be simultaneously present on a nest. To make the benefit of helping equal from the first to the fourth helper, nest
survival was increased by a constant 5% for every helper
present. Therefore, if a nest with only the mother present
had a 70% intercohort survival probability (s), the same
nest with four helpers would have a 90% survival probability. The design is such that fitness benefits of multiple
helpers accrues linearly. The mother’s intercohort survival

rate was equal to her survival rate by herself. Thus, daughters inherited the nest with the same probability as in the
previous simulations. Nest inheritance was always by the
oldest helper present. In this variation, A was only considered as a dominant allele, offspring came in cohorts of
five, and s ranged from 0.7-0.8.
