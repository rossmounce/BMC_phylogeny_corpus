The nonadaptive nature of the H1N1 2009
Swine Flu pandemic contrasts with the adaptive
facilitation of transmission to a new host
Juwaeriah Abdussamad1,2, Stéphane Aris-Brosou1,3,4*

Abstract
Background: The emergence of the 2009 H1N1 Influenza pandemic followed a multiple reassortment event from
viruses originally circulating in swines and humans, but the adaptive nature of this emergence is poorly
understood.
Results: Here we base our analysis on 1180 complete genomes of H1N1 viruses sampled in North America
between 2000 and 2010 in swine and human hosts. We show that while transmission to a human host might
require an adaptive phase in the HA and NA antigens, the emergence of the 2009 pandemic was essentially
nonadaptive. A more detailed analysis of the NA protein shows that the 2009 pandemic sequence is characterized
by novel epitopes and by a particular substitution in loop 150, which is responsible for a nonadaptive structural
change tightly associated with the emergence of the pandemic.
Conclusions: Because this substitution was not present in the 1918 H1N1 pandemic virus, we posit that the
emergence of pandemics is due to epistatic interactions between sites distributed over different segments.
Altogether, our results are consistent with population dynamics models that highlight the epistatic and
nonadaptive rise of novel epitopes in viral populations, followed by their demise when the resulting virus is too
virulent.

Background
Viruses are the cause of several deadly diseases such as
yellow fever, dengue, hepatitis or seasonal Influenza.
The etiologic agent of the latter, the Influenza virus, can
cause mild to severe illnesses depending on the Influenza type and strain. The case of the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, first detected in humans in early 2009 [1], was
caused by a antigenically novel strain that led the World
Health Organization to declare the outbreak as the first
Influenza pandemic of the 21st century. The emergence
of such viruses in the human population has since
attracted intense scrutiny, with a particular focus on two
of their properties: virulence and interspecies transmission [2].
The H1N1 virus is an Influenza A virus that belongs
to the family of orthomyxoviruses, and has a segmented
negative single-stranded RNA genome made of eight

segments that each encode 1-2 proteins necessary for
virus attachment to host cells and spread of viral infection. By approximate order of decreasing sizes, these
genes code for polymerase subunits (PB2, PB1 and PA),
the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) antigens, a nucleoprotein (NP), a ribonucleoprotein exporter
(NS2, also called NEP), an interferon antagonist (NS1),
an ion channel protein (M2) and a matrix protein (M1).
Two other proteins, PB2-F1 [3] and PB1-N40 [4], whose
roles are now emerging, have also been characterized.
This segmented genome is constantly evolving either by
accumulating mutations, which generally lead to small
antigenic differences ("antigenic drift”) or by exchanging
genomic segments, a process termed reassortment,
which, when occurring between different subtypes, can
lead to dramatic changes in antigenic properties, also
called “antigenic shift” (e.g., [5]).
The actual changes that may have led to the emergence of past pandemics start to become clearer thanks
to a number of studies. For instance, the first pandemic

of the 20th century in 1918, also known as ‘Spanish Flu’,
was caused by an H1N1 virus, which was isolated and
sequenced from a casualty preserved in the Alaskan permafrost [6]. Structural and genetic studies have shown
that this particular 1918 virus lacked a cleavage site in
HA [7], that virulence was determined by several proteins including HA, the replication complex, NS1 and
PB1-F2 [2,8], while HA and PB2 played an important
role in viral transmissibility [9]. The precise origin of
this 1918 virus is however difficult to trace back in time
due to the absence of genetic information on the viruses
circulating before the 20th century.
The emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic is, on the
other hand, not as well understood. Structural information revealed that the 2009 HA protein had a striking
similarity to its 1918 counterpart [10]. In a landmark
study, Smith and collaborators showed that the etiologic
agent of the 2009 pandemic had three key features: (i)
the polymerase genes as well as HA, NP and the NS
genes emerged from triple reassortant North-American
swine viruses while the NA and M genes originated
from avian-like swine viruses, (ii) that the pandemic
viruses diversified about a year before the onset of the
pandemic and (iii) that a long branch separated the
diversification of these pandemic viruses from their first
emergence [11]. These authors suggested that the long
branch leading to the diversification of the pandemic
viruses both reflects a long unsampled history and mild
evidence for positive selection, but they did not fully
characterize the adaptive nature of the pandemic. It is
also unclear whether the actual host-switch events from
non-human animals to humans have an adaptive nature.
Here we revisit the adaptive nature of the 2009 H1N1
pandemic with a detailed analysis of the role of selection
in (i) the emergence of this virus, and (ii) its adaptation
to human hosts. On the basis of an extended data set
compared to [11], we show that while the acquisition of
efficient human-to-human transmission was driven by
positive selection, the emergence of the 2009 H1N1
pandemic was essentially nonadaptive, and resulted
from stochastic processes, which in turn are expected to
make the prediction of such dramatic events difficult.

Results and Discussion
Phylodynamics of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic

We downloaded 1180 complete Influenza A genomes of
the H1N1 subtype in North America collected between
year 2000 and 2010, and selected only the gene
sequences with at most 99.99% similarity for each of the
ten “canonical” protein-coding genes (see Methods).
This clustering step allowed us to performed all phylogenetic analyses in a reasonable timeframe while conserving most of the sequence diversity present in the
original data set. In order to reconstruct rooted

Page 2 of 13

phylogenetic trees for each of these genes, we used the
‘relaxed molecular clock’ approach implemented in
BEAST [12] (see [13] for rooting a tree with a clock),
where tip dates were set to the collection year of each
virus. A calibration scheme at a finer time-scale was not
used because the information about the collection
month was missing from some of the sampled genomes.
The substitution models selected by the Akaike Information Criterion [14] were all GTR + Γ + I, except for
PB1 (GTR + Γ), M2, M1 and NS2 (TVM + Γ) and NS1
(TVM + I). Since TVM-based models are not implemented in BEAUTi, we employed the next best AIC
model which in all cases was based on GTR for the
relaxed clock analyses with BEAST.
The results show that H1N1 sequences across all ten
genes have very similar histories (Figure 1 for the NA
gene; see Additional File 1 and 2). If we assume that the
ancestral H1N1 genome is of swine or other nonhuman origin [11], there were a minimum of three
host-switch events to human: two occurred on internal
("deep”) branches, one of which led to the 2009 pandemic. This particular host-switch event was placed on
the long branch sustaining the 2009 clade rather than
on the short branch leading to the Mexico-swine-2009
genome because the position of this latter genome
within the 2009 clade is weakly supported (posterior
probabilities ≤ 0.20 over the ten genes analyzed). The
third host-switch event occurred on a terminal branch
of the tree (Figure 1). It is notable that only one of the
two internal host-switch events led to a pandemic,
which suggests that the two processes of host-switch
event and ‘pandemicity’ are not tightly coupled, as
already suggested by the 2005 H5N1 viruses. In the rest
of the text, we will denote the part of the tree that leads
to the human 2009 pandemic sequences as the “pandemic clade”, while all the other human sequences are
part of the “non-pandemic clade” (Figure 1).
The relaxed clock analyses also allow us to derive
three additional results on (i) the population dynamics
of the different segments and genes, (ii) their rates of
evolution and (iii) their coalescence times. First, the
results of the skyline analyses show that the population
dynamics of the different segments and genes exhibit
two very contrasted trajectories (Figure 2). While most
segments followed similar and downwards dynamics in
the past, a decoupling event or a series of such events
took place at most five years before 2009, ca. 2004,
when seven of the ten genes underwent a rapid expansion suggestive of a selective sweep. The time resolution
of our analyses is too low for us to derive more accurate
dates, but the suddenness of this expansion suggests
that it would have been difficult to forecast as it represents a dramatic departure from the previously decreasing trend. These “expanding genes” include one of the

still exhibit similar dynamics (Figure 2A). Yet, such a
decoupling of segment dynamics is not atypical in Influenza A viruses (see [16]). One notable difference with
the latter study however is that our reconstruction goes
40 years back in time before the 2009 outbreak without
encountering any of the oscillations reconstructed over
a 14 year period for H3N2 viruses [16]. A potential
explanation is that the pattern observed here is due to
our smaller effective sample size (after clustering of
sequences at the 0.01% similarity level), and/or to the
lower temporal resolution of our analysis. In spite of
these potential confounding factors, the lack of oscillations detected in our results might also reflect the lack
of evidence for seasonality in H1N1 dynamics, which is
consistent with the dominant incidence of H3N2 viruses
in the human population between 1968 (the year of the
‘Hong Kong Flu’) and 2009 [16]. While in the face of
the 2009 pandemic it makes sense that Neτ for both the
HA and NA antigens increased, it is unclear (i) why Neτ
decreased for some segments and (ii) why a decoupling
is inferred within the polymerase genes, setting PB2,
which has a role in host restriction (e.g., [17]), apart.
This decoupling of segments cannot be due to our
sequence clustering that eliminated highly similar
sequences, but under-sampling of genomes cannot be
ruled out (see below).
Second, the posterior distributions of the absolute
rates of evolution are summarized in Figure 3. These
rates are similar to those estimated in previous studies
(e.g., [11,16]), and our results suggest that there is
extensive rate heterogeneity between the different segments of the Influenza A genomes of H1N1 viruses, and
even within segments as demonstrated in particular by
the posterior estimates for M2 and M1 (Figure 3). Posthoc comparisons of rates sampled from their posterior
distributions, either by means of Tukey HSD or pairwise
t tests, show significant differences at the a = 0.001
level, even under the very conservative Bonferroni correction. Therefore, Influenza A viruses of different subtypes evolve at different rates as reviewed before [18],
and each of their protein-coding genes, even on the
same segment, exhibit significant rate heterogeneity.
Summarizing rates of evolution of Influenza A viruses
and possibly other segmented RNA viruses by a single
number might therefore not give a realistic picture of
the extensive rate variation found in these viruses.
Third, Table 1 shows that the pandemic and non-pandemic H1N1 protein-coding genes analyzed here coalesced on average 65 years before 2009, that is, around
1944 (SEM = 18.52 years, excluding PB1 and NS1). NS1
and in particular PB1 have both been circulating for
much longer periods of time (since 1878 and 1728,
respectively; Table 1). Keeping in mind that the accuracy
of the estimated dates depends on the density of sampled

genomes, three points can be made here: (i) these dates
are much deeper than in [11], where time to the most
recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the sampled
sequences goes back to ~ 1985, due to the lower breadth
of their sampling strategy. The inclusion of the 1918 Brevig genome A/Brevig Mission/1/1918 [6] for instance
would only pull this root age further back in time; (ii) we
also detected variation of coalescence times within segments: the protein-coding genes on segment 7 and 8,
M2-M1 on the one hand and NS2-NS1 on the other
hand, coalesced at slightly different dates, although their
95% HPDs overlap - which might be due to a combination of short sequences and small numbers of variable
sites in the overlapping genes on segments 7 and 8; (iii)
the observation that different segments share the same
coalescence times has already been documented and
interpreted as evidence for the correlated evolution and
co-transmission of segments [19], so that there would be
genetic linkage between segments. However, [19] found
that coalescence times were shared by the PB2/PB1/PA/
NP/M segments, while our Table 1 suggests that PB2/
PA/HA/NA/NS2 have similar root age and therefore
could be linked. The different linkage groups or constellations might be a characteristic of the different viruses
studied (avian Influenza viruses of different subtypes in
[19]vs. H1N1 in human and swine here). However, it is
also possible that such gene constellations are highly
labile both in time and across subtypes.
A way to test this lability hypothesis is to estimate the
TMRCA of the pandemic sequences. Unlike the TMRCA
of the sampled H1N1 sequences, the emergence of the

pandemic sequences shows a very consistent date across
all segments and genes at 1.22 years before 2009, that is
during the last semester of 2007 (SEM = 0.25 year). This
date is slightly older than previous estimates that put the
TMRCA of pandemic sequences sometime between mid2008 [11] to early January 2009 [1]; this difference can be
due to relaxation of selective constraints that are not
directly accounted for here [11], slight differences in
model specifications ( [1] used a coalescent prior with
exponential growth rather than a skyline model used
here) and to our generally broader (but less dense) sampling of genomes. Based on the synchrony argument
used above and in [19], this result suggests the formation
of a new gene constellation in the late 2007. The emergence of this constellation could be the consequence of a
selective sweep, as suggested in the case of avian Influenza viruses [19], but it could also be due to a demographic bottleneck in the viral population or other
nonadaptive processes.
The lability hypothesis has a corollary that is easily testable: although the reassortment events that led to the
emergence of the pandemic strain have a history that
goes back to the early 1990’s [11], consistently with the
TMRCA estimated here (MRCApandemic in Table 1), the
coalescence times of the genomes analyzed here occurred
only shortly before the pandemic. The most recent common ancestor of the pandemic clade (MRCApandemic) has
a mean age of 16.16 years before 2009 (SEM = 12.36
years; Table 1), which corresponds to the end of 1992.
The 14.94 years (= 16.16 - 1.22) gap separating this
MRCApandemic from the pandemic clade represents a long
period of time when sequences leading to the 2009 pandemic were not sampled [11]. But the long branch leading to the pandemic clade (Additional File 2) could also
be due to the simultaneous action of positive selection.

Test of positive selection for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic

To test the hypothesis that the long branch leading to
the 2009 pandemic might represent the action of positive selection, we performed a branch-site test of positive selection along this branch in all ten protein-coding
genes of the H1N1 Influenza A genome. The results,
presented in Table 2 demonstrate quite dramatically
that none of the ten protein-coding genes shows any
evidence for positive selection, hereby suggesting that
this long branch reflects exclusively a period of 15 years
of unsampled history, and hence a dramatic failure of
the current surveillance system of circulating Influenza
viruses [11].
One potential caveat with our analysis is that codon
models assume that all nonsynonymous differences
observed in the data are fixed [20]. However, when data
are sampled at the population level, as is most likely the
case here, it is possible that most of the observed differences do in fact represent segregating polymorphisms.
This is known to render the use of non-synonymous to
synonymous rate ratios (ω’s) potentially problematic, as
estimated ω ratios can take values < 1 within a population even in the presence of very strong positive selection [21]. As some of the nonsynonymous differences in
our data are potentially transient polymorphisms, we
reanalyzed the same data with two tests based on population genetics principles. First, we employed the McDonald-Kreitman test (MKT), which is a two-population
neutrality test that compares the ratio of fixed nonsynonymous to synonymous differences to the ratio of
polymorphic nonsynonymous to synonymous differences
[22]. Here, a first “population” consisted of the
sequences from the pandemic clade, while the other
“population” contained all the remaining sequences in
order to match the specification of the codon-based test

Results of the McDonald-Kreitman test (MKT; p-value), Tajima’s D test (pD), as well as log-likelihood values (ln L), parameter estimates and p-values for the ten
standard protein-coding genes of 2009 H1N1 Influenza A genomes. H0 is the null branch-site codon model, without positive selection; H1 is the alternative model
2
that allows for positive selection at sites in the foreground branches. The p-values are derived from a  1 distribution (see Methods). Parameter estimates for ω
and its proportion of sites pω are for rate categories ω < 1 under H0, and ω ≥ 1 under H1.

of positive selection. The results suggest that there is no
evidence for selection at the 1% level (Table 2), which
supports the results of the likelihood ratio test based on
codon models. Second, the results of the Tajima test,
which compares two different estimates of nucleotide
diversity under the infinite-site model, appear more contrasted, with only three genes (PB2, PA and NP) for
which neutrality cannot be rejected. This set of genes
matches exactly the list of genes with decreasing incidence (Neτ). Alternatively, the genes with an indication
that neutrality could be rejected (PB1, HA, NA, the M
and NS genes) are those that underwent a rapid and
recent expansion. The results of the Tajima test are
therefore potentially compounded by the effect of a
recent “population” expansion of these segments, which
is known to inflate the type-I error rate of this test [23].
In the absence of a clear rejection of the neutral hypothesis both with population genetics and phylogenetic
approaches, the emergence of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic
was therefore most likely due to nonadaptive processes
such as drift (e.g., [24]).
Test of positive selection for swine-to-human host-switch
events

A complementary hypothesis is that the acquisition of
the competence to be transmitted between humans

requires some adaptive changes in the genome of the
H1N1 virus of non-human origin. To evaluate this
hypothesis, we first performed the MKT, defining the
first “population” as that of viruses found in swines, and
the second “population” as that of viruses found in
humans. The results show that all the comparisons of
nonsynonymous/synonymous polymorphisms to nonsynonymous/synonymous fixations failed because of the
systematic absence of fixed differences (Table 3). This
result raises some concern about saturation, which is
probably not an issue here since the longest branch
length is ≤ 0.2 substitutions per site, except for NS1 due
to the presence in our data of a swine virus sampled in
2002 (which is actually an avian NS1-allele B; see Additional File 2). The results were identical when this
sequence was excluded from the data. The absence of
fixed differences, whose deficit usually indicates the
action of purifying selection, here might also suggest
that the MKT is not the most appropriate test for these
data. This interpretation is supported by a simulation
study that shows that the MKT exhibits unduly high
type-I error rates at the large mutation rates (scaled to
effective population sizes) typically found in RNA
viruses such as Influenza viruses [23]. On the other
hand, the Tajima test failed to reject the null hypothesis
of neutral evolution for all protein-coding genes.

Results of the McDonald-Kreitman test (MKT; p-value), Tajima’s D test (pD), as well as log-likelihood values (ln L), parameter estimates and p-values for the ten
standard protein-coding genes of 2009 H1N1 Influenza A genomes. H0 is the null branch-site codon model, without positive selection; H1 is the alternative model

Notes–na: not applicable; nfd: no fixed differences. Sites in boldface are those for which the LRT rejects H0 at the 1% level.

Although all p-values are far from the 1% threshold
used here (Table 3; except for HA, see below), this test
has been shown to be conservative [25].
From a phylogenetic standpoint, the test of positive
selection based on codon models, although used conservatively here (see Methods), detected evidence for positive selection at the 1% level in the HA and the NA
genes (Table 3). The HA gene codes for the principal
surface antigen which is responsible for viral binding to
host receptors via receptor-binding pockets, permitting
entry into the host cell by membrane fusion and endocytosis [26]. As such, the HA gene appears to be a critical factor for efficient transmission from host to host.
The NA gene codes for a tetrameric protein that facilitates the release and spread of viral particles to neighboring cells by cleaving sialic acids from infected cell
surfaces and newly formed viral particles (e.g., [27]).
Note that no evidence for adaptive evolution during
host-switch events was found in the PB2 gene, which is
often associated with host restriction (e.g., [17]). This
lack of evidence for adaptive evolution during host
switch might in turn be associated with the mild symptoms of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses in the human
population (e.g., [1]).
Of the two amino-acid sites in HA that were potentially under positive selection for adaptation to human

hosts, only site 172 (158 in [10]) belongs directly to one
of the four epitopes proximal to the receptor-binding
pocket, while site 144 (131 in [10]) is two positions
downstream of sites participating in the exact same epitope (’Sa’ in [10]). It is therefore very likely that these
two amino-acid changes improve viral binding to
human hosts.
On the other hand, the interpretation of the results for
NA is not so clear. Of the three amino-acid sites in NA
that were identified to play a potential role in the adaptation to human hosts (Table 3), site 80 does not belong
to the part of the NA protein that is usually crystalized
(see [27]), and therefore its functional role is difficult to
predict. Site 250 is in proximity of the catalytic pocket,
but is not part of the sites that interact directly with the
substrate (which are: 118, 151, 152, 224, 276, 292, 371,
and 406; e.g. [27]). Site 351 is located in a loop that
contributes to the binding of two antibodies [28]. It
should be emphasized that the identification of sites
under positive selection is difficult and not always absolutely reliable [29]. In spite of this, because our aligned
sequences are quite conserved, it is unlikely that an
unreliable alignment might have caused false positive
identification of sites potentially under selection [30].
Therefore, we posit that the identified sites might play a
role in reshaping the antigenic properties of the NA

protein during the host-switch event from swine to
human H1N1 viruses.
Characterization of the pandemic N1 structure and
epitopes

In order to test the hypothesis that the three sites identified above with the codon models do affect the antigenic properties of the NA protein, we first set out to
predict the structural changes involved between pandemic and non-pandemic molecules.
Recent work has focused on the HA protein, and has
shown that the 1918 and 2009 proteins have very similar
tridimensional (3D) structures [10]. Unfortunately, to
date, the structure of the NA protein has not been
obtained. We therefore reconstructed 3D models by
homology modeling with Swiss-Model [31]. The prediction of the pandemic NA was based on PDB template
2HTY (Protein Data Bank identifier; E-value < 10-500),
which is of type N1 but derived from an H5N1 virus
isolated in 2004 [32], which is consistent with the avian
origin of H1 [11]. Both the non-pandemic and the swine
models were derived from PDB template 3B7E (E-value
< 10-500), which is the structure of the pandemic 1918
N1 [27]. The three models covered residues 83-467 and
were quite similar (RMSD swine vs. nonpandemic = 0.15 Å;
RMSD pandemic vs. nonpandemic = 0.65 Å). The main structural difference between the pandemic and the non-pandemic structure is due to a nonsynonymous substitution
in the 150 loop, which contains the active site of NA, at

Ile 467

Val 149 (non-pandemic)

Page 8 of 13

position 149 (Figure 4). Most of the pandemic sequences
have an isoleucine at this position, just like the swine
sequences isolated in 2009. On the other hand, all the
non-pandemic sequences and swine sequences isolated
before 2009 have a valine, which is also the amino acid
used by the 1918 H1N1 NA protein and that was found
to distort the structure of the NA protein [27]. This
V149I substitution was previously reported in the context of studying two antineuraminidase compounds
(zanamivir and oseltavimir), and was judged to be too
far from the drug binding pocket to impact antiviral
susceptibility [33]. Our results therefore suggest that (i)
the V149I substitution affected the active site of NA but
(ii) could not be solely responsible for the onset of the
pandemic since the 1918 protein had a valine, unless
epistatic interactions exist. Because we have found evidence for linkage between the segments of H1N1 (pandemic clade), such epistatic interactions cannot be ruled
out; but since we found that all segments had the same
TMRCA, our current approach cannot identify the segment(-s) and the site(-s) interacting directly with loop
150 of NA. However, in spite of this change in 3D
structure of the pandemic NA protein, site 149 which is
at the core of this structural change is not a site
detected by our analyses of positive selection. Could
nonetheless loop 150 still be a strong epitope?
To address this question, we predicted the epitopes of
the non-pandemic NA proteins. Figure 5 shows the epitopes predicted for the human and swine sequences,

these two partial models (covering residues 83-467) is highlighted and is due to one amino acid difference at position 149.

conformation changed nonadaptively in the 2009
sequences (swine and humans).
On the other hand, the comparison of predicted B-cell
epitopes of swine sequences vs. human pandemic
sequences (Figure 5B) shows that the predicted epitopes
are almost identical between these two viruses, to the
exception of a small region N-terminal region 37-43.
Importantly, none of the sites potentially under positive
selection falls within a predicted epitope difference. As a
consequence, the emergence of novel NA epitopes in
the 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses is most likely
nonadaptive.

shows that a small number of differences exist between
the pandemic and the non-pandemic proteins, as a total
of five regions differ (37-43, 76-84, 261-264, 268-276, and
351-353). Notably, the sites detected to be potentially
under positive selection for host-switch events, at positions 80, 250 and 351, are included or in very close
proximity of the regions where epitope differences are
detected between pandemic and non-pandemic NA proteins. Yet, while no new epitope emerged within loop
150, this region represents an epitope present in
both pandemic and non-pandemic proteins, while its

Conclusions
To summarize the results found in this study, we
showed that (i) the only evidence for positive selection
is in the HA and NA antigenes during host-switch
events to human hosts, while the emergence of the pandemic was nonadaptive (to the virus), (ii) loop 150,
which contains the active site of NA, is an epitope present in all sampled sequences (swine, human non-pandemic and human pandemic viruses), and a recent
substitution in this epitope (V149I) spread rapidly but
nonadaptively through the viral NA sequences in 2009
irrespective of their host, potentially by means of a
demographic bottleneck in human viruses following a
reassortment event with a virus of swine origin [11], (iii)
this substitution (V149I) caused a structural modification of the 2009 pandemic NA protein, and (iv)
although this loop 150 is found in all viruses sampled
here, the pandemic NA proteins are predicted to possess
four novel epitopes not found in viruses circulating in
swines or non-pandemic humans.
These results are significant on two fronts. First, in
terms of methodology, the use of codon models proved
here to return more sensible results than the use of
population genetics test of neutrality such as the MKT
or the Tajima test, which both have limitations when it
comes to analyzing viral data as population geneticsbased tests can be sensitive to demographic changes
and/or high levels of diversity, so that these tests can
have low power [23,34]. However, the use of codon
models in the context of a population study is also not
fully satisfactory, as not all nonsynonymous substitutions
can be assumed to be fixed. To circumvent this limitation, mutation-selection models that aim at bridging the
gap between these two evolutionary scales have been
developed [35-37]. However, mutation-selection models
have, so far, not been extended to detecting selection at
certain amino acid sites in particular lineages and thus,
do not allow us to investigate the complex question as
to when (the lineages) and where (the amino acid sites)
evidence for positive selection can be found.

Second, in terms of the biology of Influenza A viruses,
our study shows that, while host-switch events and pandemics are not tightly coupled, it is likely that the emergence of new epitopes in a population is first
nonadaptive for the virus. Then, the frequency of these
epitopes increases very quickly due to drift, before
plummeting again because they are linked to a highly
virulent phenotype that kills its hosts too quickly. A
similar argument is generally derived from modeling the
population dynamics of Influenza viruses, potentially
including very sophisticated immune interactions
between hosts and viruses (e.g., [38]), and was also put
forward based on the study of H3N2 subtypes [39]. It is
also significant to note that, while certain amino acid
substitutions may be linked to the emergence of a particular epidemic or pandemic Influenza strain, such as
V149I, the persistence or re-emergence of this very
same substitution is no guarantee of an up-coming
threat to public health. More likely, the emergence of an
epidemic or pandemic ‘phenotype’ is the result of epistatic interactions between sites within [17] or across
segments, forming a constellation or network of epistatic
interactions that are changing over time in ways that we
do not currently fully understand. It is tempting to
associate these changes of epistatic interactions to antigenic shifts, and future studies should address this
potential link. The observation that evidence for positive
selection was found only in the HA and NA genes,
which are two of the genes for which N e τ increases,
while no evidence for positive selection was found in
the other genes showing such an increase may suggest
that HA, NA, PB1 and the M and NS genes might be
linked. Yet, this linkage is not constant in space or in
time as these five different segments in 2009 H1N1
viruses have different origins, with HA and NS coming
from classical swine, while NA and M come from an
Eurasian avian-like swine and PB1 comes from a human
H3N2 virus [2]. A better insight into the timing and the
forces at play in the emergence of Influenza viruses and
into the dynamics of gene constellations in Influenza
viruses will require a continuous and in-depth surveillance of the viruses circulating around the world in its
various hosts [11].

Methods
Data collection

Complete Influenza A H1N1 genomes were downloaded
from the National Center for Biotechnology Information
based on the genomeset file ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/INFLUENZA/ in February 2010. The extracted
genomes were sampled subject to the following constraints: (i) collected between 2000 and 2010, inclusively,
(ii) from Mexico, the USA and Canada, and (iii) from
human and swine hosts. This resulted in 1180 complete

Page 10 of 13

genomes (with no genome from 2010), for which we
extracted the ten standard or ‘canonical’ protein-coding
sequences (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M2, M1, NS2
and NS1). Each of them was aligned with Muscle [40]
based on their amino acid translations [41]. Only complete sequences were considered at this stage. Manual
adjustments were performed, in particular for genes on
the last two segments (M2, M1, NS2 and NS1) and the
second segment, for which some sequences are not
properly annotated; misaligned sequences were removed.
The final alignments contained 1142, 1172, 1170, 1164,
1173, 1158, 1154, 1154, 1163 and 1163 sequences,
respectively for PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M2, M1,
NS2 and NS1. Accession numbers are listed in Additional file 3.
Clustering of sequences

Because this large number of sequences would be problematic for phylogenetic analyses, we reduced the size
of these alignments by clustering sequences by similarity. Two steps were involved. First, we constructed a
matrix of pairwise distances with PAUP [42] under the
GTR + Γ + I model of evolution for each alignment.
Sequences in the resulting matrices were then clustered
with DOTUR [43] using the nearest neighbor algorithm.
Sequences similar at the 0.01% level were then discarded, which resulted in alignments containing 53, 57,
54, 78, 54, 76, 111, 70, 142 and 90 sequences, respectively for PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, NA, M2, M1, NS2 and
NS1. Alignments are available at http://www.bioinformatics.uottawa.ca/stephane.
Phylogenetic reconstruction and detection of host-switch
events

For each alignment, we selected the appropriate model of
evolution with the Akaike Information Criterion [14].
Because we need rooted trees to map ancestral hostswitch events, we used “relaxed molecular clocks” as
implemented in BEAST [12] to estimate the rooted phylogeny of each of the ten genes. The priors were set as
follows for all ten analyses. The uncorrelated lognormal
model of rate change was used [44], and mean rates were
estimated. A coalescent Bayesian skyline model with ten
breakpoints and linear splines was used as a prior for
speciation times [45]. Substitution models with a “+Γ”
component used a discrete gamma distribution with four
rate categories. The Markov chain Monte Carlo samplers
were run for 100 million steps with a thinning of 2500
steps, except for PB1 for which samplers were run for
500 million steps to circumvent convergence issues. Each
sampler was run in duplicate to check for convergence.
Burn-in periods were determined graphically with Tracer
http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software, set conservatively to 10
million (100 million for PB1), discarded from the log files

which were then combined across the two replicates for
each gene and used to produce the ten consensus gene
trees, rooted by construction.
These trees were then used to map host-switch events,
reconstructing manually the most parsimonious mappings. Given that only a small number of events were
present on the tree, this procedure is unlikely to underestimate the number of switches. In what follows, only
host-switch events from swine to human were marked
in the tree files, since we are only interested in detecting
positive selection related to that particular switch. The
sporadic host-switch events from human to swine were
left unmarked.
Tests of positive selection and of neutrality

The test of positive selection described in [46] was used
to detect site potentially under positive selection in the
branches on which host-switch events were located.
Briefly, nonsynonymous to synonymous rate ratios,
denoted ω, are used to measure selection in proteincoding genes, with ω < 1 indicating negative selection,
ω = 1 neutral evolution and ω > 1 positive selection
[20]. A branch-site codon model allows the ω rate ratio
to vary along the sequence in some pre-specified
branches, called the foreground branches, while the
ratio in the other branches, or background branches, is
kept constant and < 1 [47]. The likelihood ratio test
(LRT) used here compares a null model that does not
allow for positive selection in the foreground branches
to a model that allows positive selection at some sites in
the foreground branches [46]. To be conservative, the
LRT test statistic was assumed to follow a c 2 distribution with one degree of freedom rather than the appropriate mixture distribution [46]. Sites potentially
evolving adaptively were inferred with a Bayes empirical
Bayes method [29] at the 95% posterior probability cutoff. These analyses were performed for each of the ten
genes. All analyses were run, with PAML ver. 4.2b [48],
in duplicate starting from random initial values, in order
to check for convergence.
Neutrality was first tested with the McDonald-Kreitman test as implemented online at http://bioinf3.uab.
cat/mkt/mkt.asp [49]. The alignments were used as
computed above, and divergences were corrected with
the Jukes and Cantor model, which is similar in spirit to
a recently proposed method [23]. The p-values were
computed as a c 2 homogeneity test on a contingency
table. The Tajima test [50] was performed with the R
package pegas [51]. Only p-values based on the normal
distribution are reported. The neutrality tests for the
human 2009 H1N1 pandemic were run on sequences
from the pandemic clade (all the remaining sequences
were used as outgroup sequences for the MKT), while
the test for host-switch events was run on human

sequences (swine sequences were used as outgroup
sequences for the MKT).
Epitope and structural predictions

In order to identify linear B-cell epitopes, that is, contiguous amino acids in an antigen (NA here) that
are recognized by the antibodies of the human
(host) immune system, we used the BepiPred online
server http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/BepiPred [52]. This
machine learning method is based on the combination
of a hidden Markov model with a propensity scale
method, and was originally trained on three independent
data sets. For each amino acid position in an alignment,
a prediction score is calculated [52], and site assignment
to a linear B-cell epitope is made where the score is
above a certain threshold. Different thresholds give different sensitivities (Sn) and specificities (Sp); we used the
default threshold of 0.35 that corresponds to Sn = 0.49
and Sp = 0.75 [52]. The NA pandemic sequences were
translated from CY052236, CY044074, GQ465697,
CY054789, CY052729, CY052593, GQ402235, CY052705,
CY050881, CY053073, CY053263, CY050330, GQ465702,
CY040890 and CY052809, while the non-pandemic
sequences were obtained from DQ889687, GQ200251,
CY026221, CY025941, CY025391, CY026893, CY025215,
CY027045, CY028061, CY026877, CY028325, CY050478,
CY038772 and CY026373. The swine sequences had
accession numbers AY619960, DQ280202, DQ280218,
DQ280194, DQ280251, DQ280242, GQ150330, CY053647,
GQ484356, FJ611900 and EU604690. For each of these
three sets of sequences, the score at each site was averaged
over the sequences.
Tridimensional (3D) structures were predicted with
Swiss-Model [31], using the translation of CY052236 for
the pandemic target sequence, DQ889687 for the non
pandemic target, and DQ280194 for the swine target.
Root mean square deviations (RMSDs) were calculated
with SPDBviewer [53] based on Ca atoms, and 3D models were plotted with KiNG available at http://kinemage.
