NBS-encoding resistance genes and induction
kinetics of a putative candidate gene associated
with downy mildew resistance in Cucumis

Abstract
Background: Due to the variation and mutation of the races of Pseudoperonospora cubensis, downy mildew has in
recent years become the most devastating leaf disease of cucumber worldwide. Novel resistance to downy mildew
has been identified in the wild Cucumis species, C. hystrix Chakr. After the successful hybridization between
C. hystrix and cultivated cucumber (C. sativus L.), an introgression line (IL5211S) was identified as highly resistant to
downy mildew. Nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) genes are the largest class of disease
resistance genes cloned from plant with highly conserved domains, which can be used to facilitate the isolation of
candidate genes associated with downy mildew resistance in IL5211S.
Results: Degenerate primers that were designed based on the conserved motifs in the NBS domain of resistance
(R) proteins were used to isolate NBS-type sequences from IL5211S. A total of 28 sequences were identified and
named as cucumber (C. sativus = CS) resistance gene analogs as CSRGAs. Polygenetic analyses separated these
sequences into four different classes. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed
that these CSRGAs expressed at different levels in leaves, roots, and stems. In addition, introgression from C. hystrix
induced expression of the partial CSRGAs in cultivated cucumber, especially CSRGA23, increased four-fold when
compared to the backcross parent CC3. Furthermore, the expression of CSRGA23 under P. cubensis infection and
abiotic stresses was also analyzed at different time points. Results showed that the P. cubensis treatment and four
tested abiotic stimuli, MeJA, SA, ABA, and H2O2, triggered a significant induction of CSRGA23 within 72 h of
inoculation. The results indicate that CSRGA23 may play a critical role in protecting cucumber against P. cubensis
through a signaling the pathway triggered by these molecules.
Conclusions: Four classes of NBS-type RGAs were successfully isolated from IL5211S, and the possible involvement
of CSRGA23 in the active defense response to P. cubensis was demonstrated. These results will contribute to
develop analog-based markers related to downy mildew resistance gene and elucidate the molecular mechanisms
causing resistance in IL5211S in the future.

Background
Recently, genes that confer resistance (R) to different
types of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, fungi,
and nematodes, have been cloned by map-based cloning
and transposon tagging procedures [1-4]. Apart from
the Hm1 and Mlo genes [5,6], amino acid sequence

comparison analyses from cloned R genes revealed that
they are highly structurally conserved, such as the previously reported conserved domains leucine zipper (LZ),
NBS, LRR, transmembrane (TM), and serine/threonine
protein kinases (PKs) [1,7]. Of these cloned R genes, the
largest group consists of the NBS-LRR family, which is
characterized by an N-terminal NBS and C-terminal
LRRs. Based on the presence or absence of a toll and
interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domain at the N-terminus
of plant NBS-LRR R genes, they were divided into two

subclasses: (1) TIR-NBS-LRR, and; (2) non-TIR-NBSLRR type [8]. In addition, the last residue of the kinase2 motif of identified NBS-LRR R genes, D (Aspartate) or
W (Tryptophan), has also been used to predict (95%
accuracy) whether they belong to the TIR or non-TIR
subclass of NBS-LRR R genes [8].
Eight conserved motifs have been identified in the
NBS domains of known NBS-LRR R genes [8]. Some are
specific to the non-TIR or the TIR-NBS-LRR subfamily,
such as RNBS-A-TIR and RNBS-D-TIR in the TIR subclass, and RNBS-A-nonTIR and RNBS-D-nonTIR in the
nonTIR subclass [8,9]. Other conserved motifs such as
P-loop (kinase-1a), kinase-2, kinase-3a, and GLPL are
widely present in both classes. Conserved motifs in such
resistance genes in different plants offer a way to isolate
RGAs related to other resistance genes. Currently, RGAs
isolated using this approach have been obtained extensively by PCR amplification, with degenerate primers
designed based on the conserved domain of NBS-LRR,
such as potatoes [10], soybeans [11], lettuce [12], barley
[13], coffee [14], sunflower [15], strawberry [16], and
ginger [17]. Many cloned RGAs are either closely linked
to known R gene loci or are arranged in clusters similar
to R genes. Consequently, degenerate RCR could be a
promising approach that may facilitate the isolation of
resistance genes.
Downy mildew [Pseudoperonospora cubensis (Berk. &
M.A. Curtis) Rostovzev] is a disease that infects cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) worldwide, where it can be
devastating to European [18] and North American
growers [19]. In China, it can cause yield loss of up to
10~30% in a regular year, or more than 80% during an
epidemic year [20]. Recently, a downy mildew epidemic
infected cucumber plants in North Carolina and the
Delmarva Peninsula of New Jersey. The epidemic started
in Florida and found its way to locations as far away as
Michigan, Ohio, and then Ontario, Canada. The outbreak was evidence that some of the previously identified resistance genes (dm-1, dm-2, and dm-3) did not
provide adequate disease control [21]. Further, several
fungicides that should have provided control were ineffective because of the new pathogenicity of P. cubensis.
Therefore, improving the genetic resistance of cucumber
to downy mildew through plant breeding could be an
effective way to control this disease. The narrow genetic
base of modern cucumber cultivars and few sources of
resistance make downy mildew resistance an important
objective in cucumber-breeding programs. Therefore,
the identification of new sources of resistance to downy
mildew is desirable [21].
High resistance exists in wild Cucumis species
[22-24]. Since 1971, major efforts to create interspecific hybrids by introgression of alien disease resistant
genes from exotic germplasm into elite lines have been

Page 2 of 12

unsuccessful [25]. However, we have carried out a successful interspecific hybridization between C. hystrix
Chakr. (a wild species with 24 chromosomes found in
China) and cucumber (2n = 14) [26]. In previous studies, extensive deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) introgression from C. hystrix in the progenies from the
subsequent backcrossing of interspecific hybrid species
(C. × hytivus, amphidiploid, 2n = 38, maternal parent)
to C. sativus was observed [27-29]. Of the germplasms
developed by alien introgression, line IL5211S (BC1F7,
See “Materials and Methods”) with downy mildew
resistance was identified [30] that has potential to
improve the incorporation of cucumber resistance to
disease.
The goals of this research were to isolate RGAs
related to downy mildew resistance from line IL5211S
based on degenerate primers designed from the conserved domains of the NBS-LRR of cloned R genes in
plants, and to elucidate their character and genetic
diversity. The transcriptional expression of putative
CSRGA associated with downy mildew resistance after
infection with P. cubensis and treatment molecules
including MeJA, SA, ABA, and H2O2 was further investigated by qRT-PCR.

Results
Amplification and cloning of CSRGAs from IL5211S

Using a pair of degenerate primers, primer-R and primer-F, from previously published literature [31], a band
of the predicted size (~500 bp) was observed by PCR
amplification (not shown). The fragment was inserted
into a pGEM-T Vector, and 35 recombinant clones
were randomly selected and sequenced. Subsequently, a
homology search was carried out for each of the 35
clone sequences using the BLASTX search in GenBank.
Twenty-eight sequences were found to have a high
sequence similarity with known R genes and RGAs from
other plant species (Table 1). The remaining clones gave
either sequence similarity with retrotransposon sequence
or no match with R genes. These clones were not analyzed further in this paper.
Sequence analysis

BLASTX searches found that the highest degree of identity between the 28 sequences and the known N resistance gene protein, RGAs from C. melo, reached 37.6
and 87%, respectively (See Additional File 1,). BLASTP
searches of the deduced amino acid sequences of 28
sequences revealed the presence of the NR-ARC
(nucleotide-binding and similarity to Apaf-1, R genes,
and the Ced-4) domain. Further sequence analysis
revealed the presence of no-stop codons or frameshift
mutations in these sequences. Therefore, they were
defined as CSRGAs.

The region between the P-loop and GLPLA motifs (~170aa) of each cucumber RGA was used as a query in BLASTX searches.

In addition, sequence analysis found that amino acid
substitutions occur in the NBS conserved domains in
IL5211S. For example, the “V” residues of the conserved
P-loop motif of most cloned CSRGAs was replaced by
other residues ("S,” “L,” “M,” “T”, and “I”). The “L” residue of the GLPL motif of CSRGA9 and CSRGA15 was
substituted for both “Fs.” The amino acid substitutions
of other conserved domains were also observed.
Multiple alignment and phylogenetic analysis

Multiple alignment between the 28 CSRGAs and known
R genes including N (U15605), L6 (U27081), M
(U73916), Prf (U65391), Gpa2 (AF195939), and RPM1
(X87851) revealed the presence of conserved domains
such as P-loop, RNBS-A-TIR, RNBS-A-nonTIR, Kinase2,
RNBS-B, and GLPL (Figures 1 and 2). Previous studies
found that the P-loop, RNAS-B, and GLPL motifs
were conserved in both TIR and non-TIR NBSLRR resistance proteins, whereas the RNBS-A
TIR
(LQxQLLSxxL)
and
RNBS-A
nonTIR
(FDLxKxWVSVSDDF) motifs were found in the TIR
and non-TIR NBS-LRR resistance proteins, respectively
[8]. In addition, the amino acid residue at the end of
Kinase2 is also a characteristic feature of TIR and nonTIR NBS-LRR resistance proteins. Tryptophan (W)
corresponds to the non-TIR subclass of NBS-LRR resistance genes. In contrast, aspartic acid (D) corresponds
to the TIR subclass. The method could be used to predict (95% accuracy) whether these resistance genes
belong to the TIR or non-TIR subclass of NBS-LRR
resistance genes [8]. Adopting these criteria, all CSRGAs
cloned reported herein were divided into non-TIR and
TIR subclasses. The former includes CSRGA6, CSRGA7,
CSRGA9, CSRGA20, and CSRGA22. The remaining
23 CSRGAs belong to the TIR subclass.
To explain the relationship of cloned CSRGAs and
known R genes from other species, a phylogenic tree
was constructed using MEGA4.0 software [32]. The
genes were divided into two subgroups (Figure 3), which
is consistent with our results. Within the TIR-NBS-LRR
class, the CSRGAs are divided into three subclasses,
designated as CSRGA I to CSRGA III (Figure 3). In the
non-TIR-NBS-LRR class, the CSRGAs were clustered in
one group, designated CSRGA IV.

Pairwise comparisons between the subclasses ranged
from 33.8 to 51.2% at the nucleotide level and 5.7 to
26.8% at the amino acid level, suggesting a high degree
of divergence and encoding a larger family of proteins
with the NBS domain in IL5211S. Compared with
known R genes, the sequence homology ranged from
23.9 to 41.7% at the nucleotide level and 4.9 to 37.6% at
the amino acid level, respectively (See Additional File 1).
The subclasses I and IV consisted of 21 and 5 members
of CSRGAs, respectively. The remaining three subclasses
included one member, reflecting a difference in abundance for these CSRGA subclasses in the cucumber genome (Figure 3).
Analysis of the four groups of CSRGA gene expression

To detect the expression of the four groups of CSRGAs
in IL5211S, one CSRGA representative of each group,
namely, CSRGA17, CSRGA22, CSRGA23, and
CSRGA25, was used in further analyses. Four primer
pairs were employed to amplify from IL5211S using
genomic DNA and complementary DNA (cDNA) as the
template (See Additional File 2). The eight fragments
obtained using these combinations were then cloned,
and three clones of each were sequenced. Sequence
comparisons indicated that no differences existed
between the sequences amplified using genomic DNA
and cDNA as template and original sequences, respectively. Thus, these results suggest that by using these
four primers, the difference in expression levels
observed could be attributable to the response to each
of the CSRGA genes examined.
Differential expressions of the four classes of CSRGAs in
different organs of IL5211S

To examine the expression levels of the four classes of
CSRGAs in different plant organs from IL5211S, one
CSRGA representative of each class was randomly chosen for expression analysis using RT-PCR. Results
demonstrated that CSRGA23 was expressed in the
leaves, stems, and roots at high levels, that CSRGA22
was expressed at relatively low levels, and the remaining
two CSRGAs (CSRGA17 and CSRGA25) were expressed
at intermediate levels. The expression level of the
CSRGA23 gene in the leaves of IL5211S was also found

to be significantly higher than that of the other three
CSRGAs (Figure 4).
Effects of introgression from C. hystrix on the four CSRGA
transcription levels

To investigate whether alien DNA introgression from
C. hystrix induced the expression of the four CSRGAs
genes studied, qRT-PCR was used to analyze and compare their expression level in the wild relative, C.
hystrix, the backcross-derived elite parent, “Beijingjietou,” and line IL5211S. The results are presented in
Figure 5. It indicates that CSRGA22 and CSRGA25
exhibited no remarkable changes in the transcription
levels in IL5211S, C. hystrix, and CC3. In contrast,
CSRGA17 and CSRGA23 showed differential expression. The expression level of CSRGA17 was about
twice as high as observed in CC3. The level of
CSRGA23 expression was four times higher than that

of CC3. These results showed that introgression of
C. hystrix induced expression of partial CSRGAs.
Furthermore, the expression level of CSRGA23 was
found to be higher than that of CSRGA17 in IL5211S,
indicating that the role of CSRGA23 may be more
important than CSRGA17 in enhancing downy mildew
resistance in IL5211S.
Induction of CSRGA23 expression in response to P.
cubensis and defense signaling molecules

To understand the nature of CSRGA23 transcripts, the
induction of CSRGA23 expression in response to
P. cubensis and defense signaling molecules was examined by qRT-PCR (Figure 6A). Following infection by
P. cubensis, the transcription of CSRGA23 was 1.6-fold
higher at 6 h after inoculation. It increased to 3.5-fold at
12 h and peaked at 24 h (5.7-fold). Then the level of
CSRGA23 expression decreased by 3.7-fold at 48 h and

Figure 3 Phylogenetic tree analysis based on the alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of IL5211S RGAs with known
R genes. The tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method provided in MEGA 4.0 software. The 28 RGA sequences were grouped
into four subgroups: I and IV. I to III fall under the TIR-NBS-LRR-type RGA, whereas IV belonged to the non-TIR-NBS-LRR-type RGA. Bootstrap
values (1,000 replicates) are given below the branches. The known R genes with the NBS domain used in this study were N (U15605), L6

1.5-fold at 72 h. This result suggests that CSRGA23
might be involved in the defense response to P. cubensis.
Previous studies have shown that SA and JA are signaling molecules involved in the activation of pathogenesis-related gene expression [33,34] and defense-related
gene expression [35-37], respectively. Recent studies
indicated that other hormones such as ABA are also
involved in plant defense signaling pathways. In addition, H2O2 has been confirmed as a second messenger
in activating defense gene expression [38] and is one of
the earliest plant responses in incompatible interactions
between pathogens and plants [39].

To evaluate whether expression of CSRGA23 was
induced by various combinations of P. cubense infection
with potential resistance inducing chemicals, the level of
the CSRGA23 transcript in IL5211S leaves following
exogenous application of SA, MeJA, ABA, and H 2 O 2
was studied by qRT-PCR analysis. Following SA treatment, transcription of CSRGA23 occurred and reached
2.38-fold at 6 h after treatment. The expression of
CSRGA23 increased to 5.25-fold at 24 h and peaked at
48 h. After this, the expression level decreased but was
still at 3.63-fold at 72 h post-treatment, which is higher
than the background (Figure 6B).

In response to H2O2 treatment, the expression level of
CSRGA23 peaked at 6.58-fold higher 6 h, than that at
0 h. Then the expression of the gene decreased steadily:
4.68-fold at 12 h, 3.74-fold at 24 h, 2.2-fold at 48 h, and
1.2-fold at 72 h (Figure 6E).
Taken together, the strong induction of CSRGA23 by
exogenous application of MeJA, SA, H2 O 2 , ABA, and
the observed P. cubensis infection, suggesting that
CSRGA23 might be involved in defense responses via a
signaling the pathway activated by these molecules.

Figure 4 Relative quantities of four CSRGAs with specific
primers in different cucumber organs. Each organ sample was
individually assayed in triplicate.

Exposure to MeJA, caused CSRGA23 transcription to
increase rapidly to 79.31-fold at 6 h compared to initial
exposure expression and this same level was maintained
(79.34-fold) at 12 h, and peaked (103.57-fold) at 24 h.
However, CSRGA transcription decreased abruptly after
24 h, at 82.02-fold, fell to 35.15-fold at 48 h and 72 h,
respectively (Figure 6C).
Induction of CSRGA23 occurred rapidly after treatment with ABA. The expression level of CSRGA23
increased 50.57-fold at 6 h, peaked at 12 h (88.19-fold),
then decreased to 38.5-fold at 24 h and had a minimal
increase at 48 h compared to pre-exposure levels. After
this, the expression level again decreased to 22.06-fold
at 72 h (Figure 6D).

Discussion
Based on the successful interspecific hybridation
between C. hystrix and C. sativus, high resistance to
downy mildew cucumber IL was identified through
cytogenetics and molecular genetics combined with P.
cubensis inoculation [30]. To use the source of resistance to downy mildew fully, the determination of its
defense mechanism in response to P. cubensis is necessary. In this paper, based on the conserved domains of
plant NBS-LRR resistance genes, a pair of degenerate
primers were used to amplify its homolog gene from
IL5211S by PCR. Twenty-eight CSRGAs were successfully obtained.
Sequence alignment found that CSRGAs proteins have
a highly conserved NR-ARC domain containing P-loop/
Kinase-1a, Kinase-2, and Kinase-3a, and GLPL subdomains characteristic of most plant RGAs and R genes.
In addition, according to the principle that the W residue is found in non-TIR proteins, and the D residue is
only in TIR-containing proteins, 24 out of 28 (82%) of
the CSRGAs examined in this work belonged to the
TIR-NBS-LRR type. The remaining four CSRGAs

belonged to the nonTIR-NBS-LRR type. This distribution is commonly found in Arabidopsis and Tobacco
[40,41] and also supports the view that both TIR-NBSLRR and that non-TIR-NBS-LRR R-genes occur in dicot
species [9]. The phylogenetic tree separated CSRGAs
into four subgroups belonging to two classes of the
NBS-LRR sequence, which agrees with the results of our
classification method.

To elucidate the expressed patterns of four CSRGAs in
the different tissues from IL5211S, they were analyzed
using qRT-PCR. Figure 4 shows that the expression levels
of the four CSRGAs are different in the roots, stems, and
leaves of IL5211S. The expression level of CSRGA23 was
higher in leaves than in roots or stems. The expression
levels of CSRGA17, CSRGA25, and CSRGA22 were highest in the stems, leaves, and roots, respectively.

The effects of introgression from C. hystrix on the
four CSRGAs transcription levels were further investigated. The levels of the CSRGA26 and CSRGA25 transcript are almost the same among the distant relative
C. hystrix, CC3, and IL5211S. The expression of
CSRGA17 and CSRGA23 in IL5211S were induced by
genetic factors originating from C. hystrix. The expression level of CSRGA23 is four-fold higher than that of
CC3. These results show that introgression from
C. hystrix caused a partial change in CSRGA expression.
The enhanced expression level of CSRGA23 may be
associated with downy mildew resistance in IL5211S.
Most plant resistance genes are transcriptionally regulated in response to pathogen attack. However, due to
low expression levels, transcripts can be difficult to
detect using gel blot analysis [42]. The transcription of
the rice Xa1 resistance gene appears to increase following pathogen inoculation [43]. This indicates that the
transcription of the R gene depends on the type of
plant-pathogen interaction. In this study, the expression
patterns of CSRGA23 were investigated to gain insight
into its involvement in plant defense response (Figure
6A). Infection with P. cubensis significantly enhanced
the expression level of CSRGA23, suggesting a correlation between activating this gene and resistance to
P. cubensis. Thus, CSRGA23 might be involved in
P. cubensis-induced defense response. Similar expression
patterns have been observed for Pib and Hs1pro-1, a blast
resistance gene in rice [44,45] and a nematode-resistance gene in sugar beet [46], respectively.
Previously, some studies have reported that signaling
molecules not only function as a critical signal for
downstream resistance events but also upregulate the
expression of R genes. For example, in Arabidopsis, the
study had shown that SA treatment induced the expression of SSI4, encoding a putative protein belonging to
the TIR-NBS-LRR class of R proteins, and the closely
related TIR-NBS-LRR genes RPP1 and RPS4 [47]. Treatment with SA also increases the transcription of
RPW8.1 and RPW8.2, induces spontaneous HR-like
lesions (SHL), and enhances resistance to powdery mildews [48]. In sugarcane and soybean, it has also been
found that expression of the NBS-LRR class of resistance genes were induced by exogenous SA treatment
and wounding [49-52]. In grapevines, of the VvMLO
genes tested, the VvMLO8 and VvMLO10 genes showed
over 50-fold higher transcript levels upon H2O2 treatment, while VvMLO4, VvMLO6 and VvMLO10 genes
displayed the most marked response to SA treatment
[53]. However, some researchers have also expressed
opposite views. For example, expression of Ha-NTIR11g
and Hs1pro-1 (an RGA related to downy mildew infection
in sunflower [54] and a nematode resistance gene in
sugar beet [46]) were not induced by exogenous

Page 9 of 12

signaling molecules (i.e., ABA, H2O2). In this study, the
P. cubensis-inducible CSRGA23 gene was activated not
only by SA but also by other defense-signaling molecules (MeJA, ABA, and H2O2) (Figure 6B-6E), suggesting that these stimuli induce the expression of the
CSRGA23 gene and that CSRGA23 may play a potential
role in mediating cross-talk between defense-signaling
pathways.
Several studies also report that SA and JA act antagonistically in defense reactions [55,56]. However, more
recent studies indicate that they act synergistically [57].
In this paper, expression of CSRGA23 was induced by
SA and MeJA, suggesting that the two stimuli have
synergistic role in mediating defense responses in
IL5211S. However, the CSRGA23 gene transcriptinduced patterns were distinct. The CSRGA23 transcript-induced peak by SA occurred at 48 h and
increased 6.53-fold over 0 h, whereas the transcript peak
(103.5-fold increase over 0 h) induced by MeJA
appeared at 24 h, suggesting that CSRGA23 might be
mainly involved in the defense responses through signaling the pathway activated by these two molecules at different time points.
Taken together, these results suggest that the
CSRGA23 gene is activated in IL5211S during infection
by P. cubensis, and that it is induced by signal transduction pathways that mediated by SA, MeJA, ABA, and
H 2 O 2 . Given the prominent role CSRGA23 proteins
play in IL5211S defense responses, further examination
of their function is necessary.

Conclusions
In this study, 28 CSRGAs obtained by the homologuesequence method provided the foundation for developing molecular markers and insight into downy mildew
resistance formation. This contributes to our understanding of the organization of the NBS-LRR R gene in
IL5211S, which may in turn result in future cloning of
this “novel” downy mildew resistance gene.
Methods
Plant material, pathogen infection, and hormone
treatments

The procedure for obtaining IL5211S, an introgression line
highly resistant to downy mildew from C. hystrix and C.
sativus, was as follows (Figure 7). In the spring of 2008,
seeds of line IL5211S were germinated and grown in
growth chambers with 12 h light at 25°C and 12 h darkness at 18°C. Relative humidity was 65-75%. For the pathogen infection and hormone treatment, seedlings at the
second true-leaf stage were treated with P. cubensis and
signaling molecules containing SA (2 mM), MeJA (100
μM), and ABA (100 μM), respectively. For the H2O2 treatment, the same seedlings at the second true-leaves stage

extraction kit (Qiagen). Then the resulting DNA was
cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, USA)
and transformed into competent Escherichia coli JM 109
cells according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
The cloned DNA fragment was sequenced by Bio-Asia
Company (China).
Sequence analysis, alignment, and phylogenetic tree
analysis

were sprayed with H2O2 (10 μM) in sterile water. Control
plants were sprayed with sterile water only. The procedure
for P. cubensis infection is as follows. The second true-leaf
from each seedling was inoculated with a single drop
(approximately 0.01 ml) of inoculum, containing 12 × 104
sporangia per milliliter. Then, the seedlings were placed
inside plastic boxes and incubated at 20°C with approximately 100% relative humidity in the dark for 24 h. They
were then placed in a chamber (24°C to 30°C) in a 16 h
photoperiod.

After sequencing, the acquired DNA sequences were
removed by vector with VecScreen in GenBank, compared in homologies with the GenBank database, and
searched in the National Centre for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank using BLAST (Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool) command http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov. The percentage of amino acid identity between
the predicted protein sequences was determined using
DNAMAN6.0 computer software. The phylogenetic tree
was constructed by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method
using the NJ algorithm implemented in Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software version
4.0 [31]. Bootstrapping (1,000 replicates) was used to
evaluate the degree of support for a particular grouping
pattern in the phylogenetic tree.
RNA extraction and cDNA preparation

The same seedlings in the second true-leaf stage from
IL5211S were harvested, frozen immediately in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at -80°C. Genomic DNA was isolated using a plant DNA extraction kit (Bioteke, China).
A pair of degenerate primers were used to amplify the
region between “P-loop” and “GLPL” of the plant
R genes (See Additional File 3).

Total RNA was isolated from the leaves of IL5211S
using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with
DNase I (Promega) to remove traces of genome DNA
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The first
strand cDNA synthesis was performed using olio (dT)15
primers (Promega) and 200 units of Moloney Murine
Leukemia Virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (Promega) for 1 h at 42°C. Control reactions included a
positive RT-PCR with actin-specific primers aside from
a negative control with actin primers, but with RNA
instead of cDNA as template to test for genomic DNA
contamination. Amplicons were then electrophoresed on
1% agarose gel.

PCR amplification and cloning

CSRGA-specific primer design for expression analysis

PCR reactions were performed in 25 μl mixtures containing 20 ng template DNA, 2 μl 10× PCR Buffer, 1.5
μl 25 mmol MgCl2, 2 μl dNTPs (2 mmol/L), 1 μl Primer-F (10 μmol/L), 1 μl Primer-R (10 μmol/L), 1 unit of
Taq DNA (5 U/μl), and 15.3 μl ddH2O. PCR amplification was carried out in an MJ PTC-100 thermal cycler.
The PCR reaction cycle program was as follows. The
first step was denaturation at 94°C for 4 min, followed
by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s and
annealing at 55°C for 30 s. The primer was extended at
72°C for 60 s, extending to 72°C for 5 min.
The DNA fragment (~500 bp) was collected from the
electrophoresis gel and purified using a MinElute gel

Based on CSRGAs obtained from IL5211S, specific primer pairs were designed using Primer3.0 software. Four
pairs of CSRGA-specific primer were obtained. The conditions for semi-RT-PCR amplification were standardized with genomic DNA from the respective taxon,
and annealing temperatures were identified (See Additional File 2).

DNA isolation and primer design

Quantitative RT-PCR and data analysis

RT-PCR was conducted in a 25 μl mixture containing
12.5 μl 2× SYBRGreen PCR MasterMix (Applied Biosystems), 1 μl 10 pmoles of each primer, 1 μl template
(15× diluted cDNA from leaf samples), and 9.5 μl sterile

distilled water. The cucumber EF1a gene (EF446145)
was used to normalize the sample [58]. The thermal
conditions for RT-PCR were 95°C for 10 min (denaturation), followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 seconds and
60°C for 1 min. All reactions were performed in triplicate. Quantification analysis was performed by the comparative CT method, which mathematically transforms
the threshold cycle (C T ) into the relative expression
levels of genes (Perkin-Elmer User Bulletin). Data were
analyzed using QPCR software (Rotor-Gene) and Microsoft Excel 2003.
