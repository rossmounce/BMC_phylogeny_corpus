Abstract
Background: The diversity and function of ligninolytic genes in soil-inhabiting ascomycetes has not yet been
elucidated, despite their possible role in plant litter decay processes. Among ascomycetes, Trichoderma reesei is a
model organism of cellulose and hemicellulose degradation, used for its unique secretion ability especially for
cellulase production. T. reesei has only been reported as a cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic organism although
genome annotation revealed 6 laccase-like multicopper oxidase (LMCO) genes. The purpose of this work was i) to
validate the function of a candidate LMCO gene from T. reesei, and ii) to reconstruct LMCO phylogeny and perform
evolutionary analysis testing for positive selection.
Results: After homologous overproduction of a candidate LMCO gene, extracellular laccase activity was detected
when ABTS or SRG were used as substrates, and the recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity followed
by biochemical characterization. The recombinant protein, called TrLAC1, has a molecular mass of 104 kDa. Optimal
temperature and pH were respectively 40-45°C and 4, by using ABTS as substrate. TrLAC1 showed broad pH
stability range of 3 to 7. Temperature stability revealed that TrLAC1 is not a thermostable enzyme, which was also
confirmed by unfolding studies monitored by circular dichroism. Evolutionary studies were performed to shed light
on the LMCO family, and the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using maximum-likelihood method. LMCO and
classical laccases were clearly divided into two distinct groups. Finally, Darwinian selection was tested, and the
results showed that positive selection drove the evolution of sequences leading to well-known laccases involved in
ligninolysis. Positively-selected sites were observed that could be used as targets for mutagenesis and functional
studies between classical laccases and LMCO from T. reesei.
Conclusions: Homologous production and evolutionary studies of the first LMCO from the biomass-degrading
fungus T. reesei gives new insights into the physicochemical parameters and biodiversity in this family.

Background
Lignin degradation is a key step for recycling the carbon
fixed by photosynthesis, and to date, basidiomycetes are
the most efficient naturally-found lignin degraders [1,2].
Lignin attack is a complex oxidative process in which
heme peroxidases oxidize lignin subunits using extracellular hydrogen peroxide generated by unrelated oxidases as
a co-substrate. A second enzyme group involved in lignin

degradation is the multicopper oxidases (laccases) that
oxidize lignin subunits with molecular oxygen as the electron acceptor. Different fungal lignocellulose degradation
strategies have been reported, and a better understanding
of ligninolysis could be achieved by screening the “computational biodiversity” found in fungal genomes. Gene networks could then be highlighted and correlated to the
lignin-degrading ability of different fungal strains. For this
purpose, dedicated databases, namely CAZy [[3], http://
www.cazy.org] and FOLy [[4], http://foly.esil.univ-mrs.fr]
were designed to annotate the genes involved in the
(hemi)cellulolytic and ligninolytic processes, respectively.
In the FOLy database there is an inventory of laccases

(benzenediol-oxygen-oxidoreductase, EC1.10.3.2), which
are copper-containing oxidases able to oxidize a wide
range of aromatic compounds [5,6]. Based on multiple
sequence alignments of more than 100 laccases, four
ungapped sequences regions (L1-L4) were evidenced in
laccases [7]. The copper ligands include 12 amino acids
that are housed within these conserved regions. Moreover,
four loop regions (I, II, III, and IV) were identified and
suggested to be involved in substrate binding on the basis
of 3D structure superimposition [8].
Phenols are typical substrates of laccases (syringaldazine, DMP and guaiacol) but laccases are also able to
oxidize electron donor substrates such as ABTS [2,2’azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] or ferrocyanide [9,10].
Laccases are attractive environmentally-friendly
enzymes that have shown potential for a variety of
applications. Laccases find potential applications in pulp
delignification and biobleaching [11], dye-bleaching in
the textile and dye industries [12], treatment of wastewater [13], removal of phenolic compounds in beverages
[14], biosensor and biofuel cell construction [15] and
products of pharmaceutical importance [16].
Whereas laccases are well-known ligninolytic enzymes
in basidiomycetes, their role in ascomycetes is still being
unravelled. Potential laccases have been already reported
in ascomycetes in which laccases were supposed to be
involved in the melanin-like pigment synthesis in conidiospores, in the induction of fruiting bodies, and finally
in pathogenic interaction with plants [17-22]. Complete
annotations of the potential ligninolytic systems were
recently produced using FOLy, providing initial comparative insight into the diversity of fungal lignin degradation [4]. Putative laccase-related genes (called LO1
according our classification) were interestingly identified
in Trichoderma reesei and other ascomycetes. T. reesei
is a mesophilic soft-rot ascomycete fungus producing
high levels of cellulases and hemicellulases that are also
commercially used to modify and hydrolyze plant cell
wall polysaccharides. To date, no ligninolytic activity has
been reported for this fungus.
This paper reports overexpression of a laccase-like multicopper oxidase gene (LMCO) from T. reesei and the biochemical characterization of the recombinant protein.
Secondly, phylogenetic reconstruction and evolutionary
analyses (testing for positive selection) were performed to
explore the biodiversity of this enzyme group in
Ascomycotina.

Expression vectors and fungal transformation

After codon optimization, gene|124079| was synthesized,
sequence-checked, and ligated in the expression vector
pAMH110 after digestion with SacII and NdeI restriction
enzymes. In this vector, the T. reesei cellobiohydrolase
I-encoding gene (cbhI) promoter was used to drive the
expression of the laccase gene. Fungal transformations
were carried out essentially as described previously [24].
Media and culture conditions

T. reesei strains were maintained on potato dextrose
agar (Difco, Sparks, MD, USA) slants. Transformants
were regenerated on solid minimal medium containing,
per liter: (NH4)2SO4 5.0 g, KH2PO4 15.0 g, CaCl2 0.45 g,
MgSO4 0.6 g, CoCl2 3.7 mg, FeSO4.H2O 5 mg, ZnSO4.
H2O 1.4 mg, MnSO4.H2O 1.6 mg, glucose 20 g as carbon source, sorbitol 182 g as osmotic stabilizer, and
hygromycin 125 mg for selection. Plates were solidified
and colony growth was restricted by adding 2% agar to
the medium. Transformed protoplasts were plated in 3%
selective top agar containing 1 M sorbitol.
For screening of laccase activity on plates, transformants were plated on solid minimal medium with 200
μM ABTS. The plates were incubated for 7 days at 30°C
and checked for development of a purple halo. In the
shake flask cultivation, the transformants were grown in
minimal medium containing, per liter: (NH4)2SO4 5.0 g,
KH 2 PO 4 15.0 g, CaCl 2 0.6 g, MgSO 4 0.6 g, CoCl 2
3.7 mg, FeSO4.H2O 5 mg, ZnSO4. H2O 1.4 mg, MnSO4.
H2O 1.6 mg, peptone 5 g, lactose 40 g, Solka floc cellulose (International Fiber Corporation, North Tonawanda, NY, USA) 20 g as carbon sources and inducers,
and piperazine-N,N’-bis(2-ethanesulphonate) 33 g. The
pH was adjusted to 5 with KOH. The culture medium
was inoculated with 1 × 10 7 spores per 50 ml and
grown in baffled flasks at 30°C with stirring at 200 rpm.
Aliquots (1 mL) were collected daily from liquid culture
medium and cells were removed by filtration (0.45 μm).
Laccase activity was subsequently measured.
Laccase activity measurement

In the culture medium, laccase activities were determined quantitatively by monitoring the oxidation of
500 μM ABTS at 420 nm (extinction coefficient,
36000 M -1 cm -1 ) in the presence of 50 mM Na-Ktartrate, pH 4.0 at 30°C. For optimal pH determination,
laccase activity was also measured by following the
oxidation of syringaldazine (SRG) [N,N’-bis-(3,5dimethoxy-4-hydroxybenzylidene)hydrazine] to quinone
(ε = 65 000 M-1·cm-1) at 525 nm [25].

Strains

Escherichia coli JM 109 (Promega, Charbonnières,
France) was used as plasmid host. T. reesei strain RutC30 [23] was used for homologous overexpression.

Purification and protein characterization

The best-producer transformant was inoculated in the
same conditions as in the screening procedure. Culture

was harvested after 7 days of growth, filtered (0.7 μm),
and concentrated by ultrafiltration through a polyethersulfone membrane (molecular mass cut-off: 30 kDa)
(Millipore). The concentrate was dialyzed against the
binding buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) and Histagged recombinant protein was purified on a Chelating
Sepharose Fast Flow column (13 × 15 cm; Amersham
Biosciences) previously charged with 0.4 M NiSO4 solution, and equilibrated with five column volumes of binding buffer. After extensive wash with binding buffer,
bound proteins were then eluted with 3 column
volumes of an imidazole gradient (0-150 mM) in binding buffer at a flow rate of 1 mL.min -1 and collected
with fractions of 5 mL.
Protein analysis

Protein concentration was determined according to [26]
using bovine serum albumin as standard. Protein purification was followed by SDS/PAGE on 11% polyacrylamide
slab gels that were then stained with Coomassie blue.

Construction of the phylogenetic tree

From the query sequence (gene|124079| reference to
T. reesei genome database, JGI: http://genome.jgi-psf.
org/Trire2/Trire2.home.html), a dataset of putative
homologous sequences was built by BLAST [27] run on
the Non Redundant database. The raw dataset was
manually filtered to eliminate potentially non-homologous sequences, disturbing alignments and duplicates.
Sequences retrieved were only focused on scope
TaxeID = 4751 (fungal kingdom). An alignment was
created using MUSCLE [28] and large gaps were manually eliminated. A default parameter for gap columns
thresholds was set at 0.85. A bias correction phase was
used to eliminate: i) sequences with a diverging composition, using an amino-acid composition test bundled
with TREE-PUZZLE software [29] with an alpha risk set
to 5%. From this alignment, a phylogenetic tree was
generated using maximum likelihood methods [30].
Bootstrapping was carried out with 1000 replications.
Evolutionary analyses: testing for positive selection

Temperature and pH optimum

Laccase activity of the purified TrLAC1 was assayed at
various setpoint temperatures (range: 30°C to 60°C). For
pH, laccase activity was assayed in 50 mM citrate/100 mM
phosphate buffer (pH 2.5-7.0), in 50 mM phosphate buffer
(pH 6-8) and in 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 9) at 30°C. ABTS
was used as substrate in both experiments, and syringaldazine was used to determine optimal pH.
Temperature and pH stabilities

The effect of temperature on enzyme stability was studied
by incubating pure enzyme from 30 min to 24 h at temperature ranging from 30°C to 50°C. After this treatment,
residual enzyme activity was determined under standard
conditions. The effect of pH on enzyme stability was studied by incubating pure enzyme for 30 min to 48 h at pH
ranging from 3.0 to 7.0 in 50 mM citrate/100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 2.5-7.0) and in 50 mM phosphate buffer
(pH 6-8) at 4°C. After this treatment, residual enzyme
activity was determined under standard conditions.
Circular dichroism spectroscopy

Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a
JASCO model J-720 CD spectrometer equipped with a
PTC-38WI Peltier thermally controlled cuvette holder.
Far-UV (240-190 nm) CD measurements were performed with 2 μM enzyme in 10 mM sodium phosphate
buffer pH 7.1 at 25°C, using a 1-mm cell and a bandwith of 1 nm. Spectra were accumulated four times and
the values were corrected for buffer contributions.

Protein and DNA sequences were retrieved from the
National Center for Biotechnology Information. Protein
sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [28]. Correspondence between protein alignment and each DNA
sequence was established using Wise2 software followed
by manual adjustments [31]. The final alignment contained 290 codons for the dataset.
The codeml program of the PAML (Phylogenetic
Analysis by Maximum Likelihood; [37];) 3.15 software
package was applied to test for positive selection.
PAML uses a maximum likelihood algorithm to assign
likelihood scores to different models for selection. If a
model incorporating positive selection gave a higher
likelihood score than a null model without positive
selection, this constitutes evidence for positive selection.
Model A implemented by Yang & Nielsen was used
[33]. This model enables ω (= dN/dS) to vary both
between sites and between lineages, and was implemented in the maximum likelihood framework. Branch A
tested for positive selection was labelled as foreground
branch, and all remaining branches were labelled as
background branches. This model was then used to
construct two likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) by comparison against models that do not identify positive selection. The null hypothesis for test 1 is the site model
M1a [34,35] which assumes two site classes with 0 < ω0
< 1 and ω1 = 1 for all branches. For test 2, the null
hypothesis is the branch-site model A but with ω2 = 1
fixed. Positively-selected sites were identified by the
Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) method [34].

Results
Genome annotation of the FOLymes in T. reesei QM6a

Genome annotation of T. reesei QM6a was performed
using the FOLy database. Annotation was focused on
enzymes potentially involved in the degradation of lignin
and related aromatic compounds. Surprisingly, 6 genes
were annotated as laccase-like multicopper oxidase
encoding genes (LMCO): jgi|124079|, jgi|122948|, jgi|
5119|, jgi|54239|, jgi|102820| and jgi|121098|. Among
these candidate genes, model 124079 was selected for
further functional investigation for its characteristic
motif identification and sequence similarity with classical laccase proteins. This gene is 2193 bp in length and
contains 5 introns. The genomic context of this gene
was studied to exclude the possibility that it is a pseudogene. The promoter sequence contained CAAT and
TATAA boxes at -658 and -109, respectively. Searches
for specific regulatory elements revealed 21 heat-shock
elements (HSE) and one nitrogen metabolite regulation
(NIT2-like). Interestingly, two putative metal response
elements and one xenobiotic response element involved
in laccase gene regulation in white-rot fungi were identified but located downstream of the ATG (+41; +102 and
+11, respectively). The functionality of these regulatory
elements needs to be experimentally verified. The corresponding protein, called TrLAC1, contains 623 aa and
possesses a classical signal peptide of 20 aa. Structure
prediction of TrLAC1 is similar to laccases from basidiomycetes such as Trametes species and Pycnoporus
cinnabarinus (data not shown).

activity against ABTS was detected on day 2 and the activity increased until day 6 having the maximum activity of
0.6 nkat.mL-1. According to the specific activity determined
for the purified enzyme, production yield was 280 mg.L-1.
Characterization of the recombinant TrLAC1 protein
Molecular mass and protein identification

The electrophoretic mobility of the total secreted proteins in the culture medium was checked on SDS-PAGE
(Figure 1). Compared against the negative control
(supernatant from wild-type strain, Figure 1, lane a), an
additional band was visualized at ~104 kDa in the
TrLAC1 transformant (Figure 1, lane b). Recombinant
TrLAC1 was purified through a one-step chromatographic strategy (IMAC). The homogeneity of the
recombinant TrLAC1 was controlled by SDS-PAGE
(Figure 1, lane c) and a single ~104 kDa band was
detected. The deduced molecular mass of the predicted
mature TrLAC1 is ~67 kDa, thus the experimental
molecular mass of TrLAC1 could originate from variable mobility in SDS gel analysis and cellular processing
such as glycosylations (the mature sequence reveals 6
consensus sites for N-glycosylation). Identification of the
recombinant TrLAC1 was confirmed by tryptic digestion
followed by MALDI-TOF analysis (data not shown).
When the extracellular protein patterns of the parental

Homologous overexpression of the laccase-like
gene|124079|

Codons of gene|124079| were optimized to perfectly fit the
general Trichoderma reesei codon usage. Non-optimized
and optimized DNA sequences showed an identity of
77,9%. The signal sequence of the laccase genes itself was
used in the expression cassette. Six histidine codons were
introduced to the C-terminus to provide a tag for subsequent protein purification. Gene expression was regulated
by the inducible cbh1 promoter and chb1 terminator. T.
reesei RUTC-30 was co-transformed with the genetic cassette including gene|124079|cloned in the expression vector PAMH110, and a vector containing the hygromycin
resistance selection marker. Transformants were selected
for their ability to grow on solid minimum medium containing hygromycin. Transformants were first screened on
plates based on the appearance of purple halos flagging
ABTS oxidation. Secondly, approximately 125 colonies
were screened by assaying laccase activity in the culture
medium, and the best producer was selected for further
analysis. The best-producer transformant was then cultured to study the time course of laccase activity. Laccase

(lane b) were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE (11% polyacrylamide) gel. Gel

strain and the best tranformants (Figure 1, lanes a and
b) were compared, it is evident that the most abundant
band corresponding to the cellobiohydrolase CBHI is
missing from the transformant. This indicates that the
expression construct has replaced the cbh1 gene by
homologous recombination in this transformant.
pH and temperature optimum of TrLAC1

The optimum temperature and pH of TrLAC1 was measured by assaying its activity at different temperature
and pH values using ABTS as a substrate. The optimum
temperature was 40-45°C and optimum pH was 4
(Figure 2a and 2b). Activity towards the canonical laccase substrate syringaldazine (a phenolic compound)
was also determined and optimum pH was pH 7.
Effect of pH value and temperature on the residual activity
of TrLAC1 after incubation

TrLAC1 was incubated for different times at different
temperature and pH values and subsequently the residual activity was measured. The enzyme conserved its
activity at 30°C after 3-hr incubation but TrLAC1 lost
approximately half of its activity after 24 h (Figure 3a).
TrLAC1 is not a thermostable enzyme. At 35°C and
40°C, 30% and 66% of enzymatic activity, respectively,
was lost. At 45°C, laccase activity was totally lost after 2
hours. However, TrLAC1 showed good stability within a
pH range of 3 to 7 (Figure 3b).
Kinetic properties

The kinetic parameters of the recombinant TrLAC1
were determined using Lineweaver-Burk plot method by
using ABTS as substrate (Table 1). Km, and Vmax were
determined from Lineweaver-Burk plot analysis as 0.137
mM and 9.37 nkat.mL-1, respectively. Specific activity
equals 2.13 nkat.mg-1.
Circular dichroism

The far-UV CD spectra of TrLAC1 under native and
thermally denaturing conditions were compared as an
indicator of the secondary structure. Figure 4 showed

Page 5 of 10

that the spectra measured at 25°C differed from the
spectra measured at 90°C, suggesting that the native
TrLAC1 exist in a conformational state with significant
secondary structure. Moreover, thermal stability (30 to
90°C) was assessed using CD by following the change at
222 nm (data not shown). Although very broad with no
clear folded-unfolded transition state, it was evident that
the protein is not thermostable, which is in agreement
with the data from the residual activity measurements.
Evolutionary analyses
Phylogenetic analyses

All the homologous proteins of TrLAC1 from T. reesei
were selected from non-redundant databases and integrated into phylogenetic analysis using maximum likelihood for phylogenetic reconstruction. The high
bootstrap values confirmed robust tree topology. Phylogenetic analysis clearly differentiated two distinct
groups containing the laccases of Basidiomycota and
Ascomycota, TrLAC1 belonging to the latter group.
According to the tree topology, Basidiomycota and
Ascomycota groups belong to two different evolutionary histories leading to high sequence divergence
between homologs. The Ascomycotina group is split
into two subgroups with a high bootstrap value of 862
(Figure 5). No complete functional characterization has
yet been carried out in the Ascomycotina group. This
study on TrLAC1 provides therefore a biochemical
investigation in the Ascomycotina group that could
facilitate future functional annotation in the clade by
functional inference.
The Basidiomycotina group is divided in two subgroups (bootstrap values of 1000) including the classical
laccases (Pycnoporus, Trametes) involved in ligninolysis
and the laccase from the pathogenic yeast Cryptococcus
neoformans involved in the biosynthesis of melanin as a
virulence factor.

under standard conditions by using ABTS “blue diamond” and SRG “pink square” as substrates.

square”, 5 “yellow triangle”, 6 “blue cross”, 7 “purple star”.

Evolutionary analyses

In order to shed light on the differences between classical laccases and LMCO from Ascomycotina as studied
in this work, we hypothesized that positive selection
occurred along the lineage leading to classical Basidiomycotina laccases, and the branch was labelled a. The
purpose of this analysis was to test for positive selection
along the branch leading to ligninolytic enzymes, i.e. laccase, and to evidence sites under positive selection.
The branch-site model A was applied to test evolutionary shift by maximum likelihood analysis. Branch a
was considered as the foreground branch and all others
as background branches in the phylogenetic tree. Parameter estimates under model A suggested that 39.3% of
sites were under positive selection with ω 2 = 14.2,
whereas 10.2% of sites were under the neutrality
assumption with ω1 = 1 fixed, and finally 50.3% of sites
were highly conserved with ω0 = 0 (Table 2). The likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) gave 2Δl = 33.78 with P < 10-4
and df = 2 for the test comparing model A to model
M1a (neutral) and 2Δl = 6.84 with P < 10-2 and df = 1
for the test comparing model A to model A with ω2 = 1
fixed. Therefore, LRTs confirmed that results were
highly significant.

These results demonstrated that positive selection
occurred, and the Bayes empirical Bayes (BEB) test identified 16 sites under positive selection along the branch
leading to classical laccases, at a probability level of
>90%. These results show that positive selection drove
the evolution of sequences leading to well-known laccases involved in ligninolysis. Among these sites, 14 are
not conserved in the TrLAC1 sequence, meaning that
these sites could be targeted for mutagenesis and functional studies between classical laccases and LMCO
from T. reesei (and more generally from Ascomycotina).

Discussion
A large number of microbial genomes relevant to lignocellulose degradation are currently being sequenced
[36]. Among them, T. reesei is a model organism of fungal decay of cellulose and hemicellulose, and its enzymes

were demonstrated to have potential in production of
bioethanol and other biological products from biomass.
T. reesei is widely used for its unique secretion ability,
especially for cellulase production. T. reesei fungus possesses 10 genes encoding well-known cellulases (endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases) and 16 genes that
encode hemicellulase genes classified in several CAZyme
families [3,37]. T. reesei has never before been considered as a potentially lignin modifying fungus. The study
of an endogenous LMCO in T. reesei, the biotechnological workhorse of the genus Trichoderma, is therefore of
interest for the multiple biotechnological applications
using this fungus and is important in an ecological context [38].
In literature, there are several records of laccases production by ascomycetes. In the genus Trichoderma
(T. atroviride and T. harzianum), laccase activity was
correlated with the production of the green pigment in
conidial spores [39]. Laccase activity has also been evidenced in the tropical xylariaceous fungi that are probably responsible for the lignocellulolysis despite their
slow decay ability in vitro [40]. In addition, laccases
were purified from phytopathogenic ascomycetes such
as Gaeumannomyces graminis [41], Magnaporthe grisea
[42]Ophiostoma novo-ulmi [43]Mauginiella [44]Monocillium indicum [45], Neurospora crassa [46].
Concerning recombinant enzyme production, the
expression of an ascomycete laccase-encoding gene from
Melanocarpus albomyces was reported in T. reesei and
the recombinant protein characterized [21]. Additionally,
heterologous expression of a thermostable laccase from
the ascomycete Myceliophtora thermophila was successfully achieved in Aspergillus oryzae [47].
Fungal LMCOs could play physiological roles in lignin
degradation in addition to other functions, such as iron
metabolism, pathogenic interactions, pigment synthesis
in conidiospores, in the induction of fruiting bodies and
in offensive/defensive strategies during interactions of
fungi [17-20,48,49].
The annotation of T. reesei genome using the FOLy
database revealed the presence of laccase-like multicopper oxidase genes (LMCO) related to laccase sequences
from Basidiomycetes (Levasseur et al., 2008a). To date,
no expression of these genes has been evidenced in
T. reesei, and it could be hypothesized that a specific
expression pattern strictly constraints expression.
Homologous overproduction assays were conducted
for the gene jgi|124079|. The supernatant of the transformed strain showed laccase activity and the corresponding recombinant protein was named TrLAC1.
Biochemical characterization revealed that this enzyme
is active on typical specific laccase substrates including
ABTS and syringaldazine. Interestingly, TrLAC1 has a
higher pH optimum spectrum on syringaldazine

Page 8 of 10

compared to most of the other basidiomycete laccases
(i.e. Pycnoporus cinnabarinus). The optimal pH of
TrLAC1 is similar to laccases from the basidiomycete
Cyathus stercoreus and the ascomycete Melanocarpus
albomyces that have been reported to have optimal pH
of 6-7 by using syringaldazine [50,51].
Interestingly, optimum pH differed strikingly according to the substrate used as the optimum pH was 7 with
the phenolic substrate syringaldazine and 4 with the
nonphenolic substrate ABTS. Such a behaviour has
already been reported for other fungal laccases and
could be explained by two phenomena: one generated
by the redox potential difference between a reducing
substrate and the type 1 copper of laccase and another
generated by the binding of a hydroxide anion to the
type 2/type 3 coppers of laccase [52,53].
In a biotechnological point of view, TrLAC1 represents a candidate for applications at alkaline pHs such
as bioremediation of textile wastewaters and of wastewaters produced by chemical plants in the manufacturing organic molecules [54]. Nevertheless, TrLAC1 had a
low specific activity on ABTS as compared to basidiomycete laccases. For instance, P. cinnabarinus laccase
has a specific activity ~800 times higher on ABTS than
TrLAC1 [55]. Positively selected sites in TrLAC1 could
be specifically targeted in future to study their impact in
the enzymatic efficiency.
There are surprisingly few studies focused on the
diversity and function of LMCO genes in soil-inhabiting
ascomycetes, despite their probable role in plant litter
decay processes [56-58]. In order to screen the gene biodiversity of potential laccases from Ascomycotina, a
phylogenetic tree was constructed using maximum likelihood analysis. Numerous homologs of TrLAC1 were
observed in the Ascomycotina group, especially in the
Aspergilli. For instance, Aspergillus niger CBS513.88 has
5 potential candidate homologous genes similar to
LMCO. Interestingly, a paralog was identified in T. reesei (jgi|54239|). In an evolutionary point of view, functional characterization of this candidate protein could be
useful to understand the evolution of LMCO in T. reesei
and to unravel the fate of duplicates in genome. Functional characterization has not been performed in the
Ascomycotina group, and TrLAC1 characterization
could therefore be useful for future evolutionary-based
functional annotation [4,59].
In order to shed light on the evolutionary history of
laccases, branches leading to well-known ligninolytic
laccases were targeted for testing selective pressure.
Positive selection was detected, and specific sites were
evidenced. Comparing these positively-selected sites to
the laccase from Ascomycotina could target potential
sites for future directed mutagenesis research. Hybrid
laccases combining Ascomycotina sequences and

positively-selected sites identified in Basidiomycotina
could prove useful for testing new physico-chemical
properties for biotechnology applications [60,61]. In
addition, testing positively-selected sites could be valuable in drawing a parallel between functional and evolutionary shifts in the multi-copper family.

Conclusions
T. reesei, the biotechnological workhorse of the genus
Trichoderma, has only been reported as a cellulolytic
and hemicellulolytic organism. This work reports homologous overexpression of the first LMCO from T. reesei
and the biochemical characterization of the recombinant
protein. In addition, phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses were carried out to explore the biodiversity of this
enzyme group in Ascomycotina. Positive selection was
detected, and specific sites were evidenced and could be
specifically targeted in future to study their impact in
the enzymatic efficiency. These results give new insights
into the physicochemical parameters and evolution in
fungal LMCO.
