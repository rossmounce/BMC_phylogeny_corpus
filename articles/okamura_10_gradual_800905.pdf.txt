Abstract
Background: DNA methylation by the Dnmt family occurs in vertebrates and invertebrates, including ascidians,
and is thought to play important roles in gene regulation and genome stability, especially in vertebrates. However,
the global methylation patterns of vertebrates and invertebrates are distinctive. Whereas almost all CpG sites are
methylated in vertebrates, with the exception of those in CpG islands, the ascidian genome contains approximately
equal amounts of methylated and unmethylated regions. Curiously, methylation status can be reliably estimated
from the local frequency of CpG dinucleotides in the ascidian genome. Methylated and unmethylated regions tend
to have few and many CpG sites, respectively, consistent with our knowledge of the methylation status of CpG
islands and other regions in mammals. However, DNA methylation patterns and levels in vertebrates and
invertebrates have not been analyzed in the same way.
Results: Using a new computational methodology based on the decomposition of the bimodal distributions of
methylated and unmethylated regions, we estimated the extent of the global methylation patterns in a wide range
of animals. We then examined the epigenetic changes in silico along the phylogenetic tree. We observed a gradual
transition from fractional to global patterns of methylation in deuterostomes, rather than a clear demarcation
between vertebrates and invertebrates. When we applied this methodology to six piscine genomes, some of which
showed features similar to those of invertebrates.
Conclusions: The mammalian global DNA methylation pattern was probably not acquired at an early stage of
vertebrate evolution, but gradually expanded from that of a more ancient organism.

Background
In mammals, DNA methylation is achieved by the collaboration of several DNA methyltransferases; i.e., Dnmt1
and the Dnmt3 family [1]. It plays important roles in
general gene silencing, the repression of one of the two
alleles of imprinted genes and X-linked genes in females,
and the inactivation of various transposons. Whereas the
Dnmt family is not found in some model organisms,

such as the budding yeast, nematode, and fruit fly, in
which DNA methylation is absent or below the limit of
detection, it is well conserved among deuterostomes [2].
However, functional analyses of the methylation have
been limited to mammals; i.e., mouse and human. In
contrast, the DNA methylation status has been investigated widely, from mammals to invertebrate deuterostomes, such as the sea urchin, revealing that large parts
of these genomes are subject to stable methylation, even
in invertebrates [3]. Methylated and unmethylated DNA
sequences coexist and pattern the genomes of these animals. Unmethylated stretches in vertebrates are mainly

limited to CpG islands, which have been used as gene
markers [4].
It is well documented that the global patterns and
levels of DNA methylation are distinct between vertebrates and invertebrate deuterostomes [5]. In the former
group, almost every CpG site is methylated, with the
exception of those in CpG islands. For instance, nearly
80% of CpG sites are methylated in the human genome
[6]. Because CpG sites are excessively concentrated in
CpG islands, we may infer that almost all other parts
are methylated regions. This is called global pattern of
DNA methylation. In contrast, the genome of the sea
squirt, an ascidian, for instance, contains roughly equal
amounts of methylated and unmethylated regions [7].
Relatively long genomic tracts of tens or hundreds of
kilobases are hypermethylated, and other long tracts are
hypomethylated. The alternation of these two distinctive
types of tracts is called fractional or mosaic pattern of
DNA methylation. DNA methylation analyses of the sea
urchin, lancelet, ascidian, lamprey, and hagfish have suggested that the transition from the mosaic to the global
methylation pattern occurred at an early stage of vertebrate evolution [5,8].
Curiously, especially to computational biologists,
methylated and unmethylated regions can be reliably
predicted from the local frequency of CpG dinucleotides
[9]. Separated by relatively sharp boundaries, methylated
and unmethylated regions tend to contain few and
many CpG sites, respectively. This may be attributable
to the inherent mutability of 5-methylcytosine [10] and
seems to be consistent with our knowledge of the
methylation status of CpG islands and other regions in
the mammalian genomes [11].
So far, however, DNA methylation patterns and methylation levels have not been analyzed in the same way in
vertebrates and invertebrates. The prevalent view that the
DNA methylation of the two groups differs seems to have
hindered us from examining their common features,
despite the use of orthologous enzymes in both systems.
It is unlikely that the change in the methylation pattern
happened suddenly at a specific evolutionary stage. An
abrupt change in the pattern of methylation could be
deleterious to organisms. If a gradual transition from the
mosaic to the global methylation pattern occurred, traces
of the transition might be apparent in extant organisms
located evolutionarily near the transition zone; e.g., fishes
and invertebrate chordates.
To test this possibility of a gradual transition, we
developed a new computational methodology to estimate the distributions of methylated and unmethylated
regions in various animal genomes. This methodology
does not confidently predict the methylation status or
level in a specific region, but predicts the proportion of
methylated and unmethylated regions from local

frequencies of CpG dinucleotides. It is well known that
in genomic imprinting and X-inactivation, one member
of a pair of alleles with identical sequences sometimes
exhibits a different level of DNA methylation, and these
variations in methylation levels are often dependent on
the developmental stages, tissues, or cell types [12]. The
levels also vary among various cancer cells [13]. Heavily
methylated CpG islands [14] and long unmethylated
tracts with low CpG contents [15] have also been documented. Recent research has suggested that specific
sequence motifs are more important than CpG contents
in the establishment of proper DNA methylation [16].
These facts make us reluctant to predict methylation
levels. However, because these observations are exceptional and infrequent compared with the general features observed in whole genomes, the proportion of
DNA methylation may be stochastically estimated in
each species. Experimental data for the human and ascidian genomes demonstrated the plausibility of this
methodology. We applied the method to the analysis of
deuterostomes, from the sea urchin through to the
human to evaluate the extent of the global methylation
pattern, and investigated the global changes in DNA
methylation pattern in silico.

Results
To identify typical patterns of mosaic and global DNA
methylation, we first arbitrarily chose four 2-Mb contiguous regions from four distinctive species and drew the
changes in the ratios of observed over expected CpG numbers, hereafter called the “CpG score” (as in the UCSC
database), along the genomic coordinates (Figure 1).
A mosaic pattern is seen in the ascidian genome, characterized by the frequent appearance of broad crests of presumably unmethylated regions. In contrast, a global
pattern is apparent in the human genome, characterized
by sharp sparsely distributed peaks. The peaks presumably
correspond to CpG islands, which are generally unmethylated. The patterns seen in the zebrafish and frog genomes
appear intermediate between those of the ascidian and
human.
Among the deuterostomes, we chose the genomes of
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (purple sea urchin), Branchiostoma floridae (Florida lancelet), Ciona intestinalis
(ascidian), Danio rerio (zebrafish), Xenopus tropicalis (western clawed frog), Anolis carolinensis (green anole), Gallus
gallus (chicken), Ornithorhynchus anatinus (platypus),
Monodelphis domestica (gray short-tailed opossum), Canis
familiaris (dog), Mus musculus (mouse), and Homo
sapiens (human) to represent various clades, namely, echinoderms, cephalochordates, urochordates, fishes, amphibians, reptiles, avians, monotremes, marsupials, carnivores,
rodents, and primates (Figure 2). We then examined the
genome-wide distributions of the CpG scores for each of

regions are indicated by shaded tracts above the graph. Typical mosaic and global patterns are seen in the ascidian and human genomes,
respectively.

examined in the present study. Out of them, 18 species are schematically represented here [26,31]. Human is placed at the bottom. The upper
species are placed, the further they are diverged from human. As for teleosts, they are ordered in accordance with the two ratio (Tables 1 and 2).

them, with a sliding window of 2 kb. In animals with a
mosaic pattern, a bimodal distribution can be seen, arising
from comparable amounts of low- and high-CpG-score
regions. In other animals, only the low-CpG band is
conspicuous, reflecting a global methylation pattern
(Figure 3).
A similar analysis of CpG-score distributions has been
performed for 3 invertebrate and 6 vertebrate genomes
[17]. Those authors showed markedly different distributions of CpG scores in the promoter and intronic
sequences. Our results for whole genomes are congruent
with their distributions in intronic sequences. It has
been reported that invertebrate and vertebrate genomes
show bimodal and unimodal distributions, respectively.
Using the NOCOM software with an expectation maximization algorithm to fit the distribution data [18],
Elango and Yi revealed that, in invertebrates, methylated
and unmethylated regions show discrete normal distributions with low and high CpG scores, respectively.
Although the vertebrate distributions were assumed to
be unimodal, we noted that the bell shapes were not
symmetrical. The right sides of the curves, which correspond to higher CpG scores, bulged slightly. This could
be caused by the distribution of CpG scores in
unmethylated regions. Indeed, CpG islands, which are
considered unmethylated regions in general, cover only
0.69% and 0.39% of the human and mouse genomes,
respectively (see Methods). When we applied the
NOCOM software to each seemingly unimodal distribution to separate it compulsory into two distinct normal
distributions, better fits were obtained (Figure 3).
It is likely that these two components separately
represent the CpG-score distributions of putative
methylated and unmethylated regions. To demonstrate
the plausibility of dividing the single distribution into
two normal distributions, we examined the distributions
of experimentally verified hypermethylated and hypomethylated regions. We first used methylation data provided by the Human Epigenome Project [19,20]. For
each 2-kb window, the CpG score and the average of
methylation level were calculated and represented as
histograms. We assumed that windows with averages of
70%-100% and 0%-30% are hypermethylated and hypomethylated regions, respectively (Figure 4). Both of the
regions had bell-shaped distributions, supporting the
plausibility of this method. Compared with Figure 3, the
right peak is somewhat protruding because of the preferential selection of CpG islands in the Human Epigenome Project. We also drew similar histograms for two
1-Mb genomic regions of the ascidian genome analyzed
by methylation-sensitive PCR [9]. Although the number
of data was not large, the histograms look bell-shaped
(Figure 4). The implication of these results is that the
CpG score cannot predict the methylation level in a

Page 4 of 10

specific region, but can stochastically identify the ratio
of methylated to unmethylated regions. For instance,
there are some hypomethylated regions with low CpG
scores and the extent of these regions can be estimated
by fitting them to a normal distribution.
We thought that the decomposition method should
allow us to draw a line between the two regions in each
organism. In ascidians, for example, a CpG score of 0.8
was used as the demarcation to distinguish methylated
and unmethylated regions [9]. In addition to the uncertainty implicit in using this fixed value, another concern
is whether or not a fixed value can be applied to all
organisms with different G+C and CpG contents. We
conceived an impartial way in which the barycenter of
the two normal distributions could be used as the decision boundary for each species. In this way, we can
separate the methylated and unmethylated regions with
confidence species by species. The barycenter calculated
for the whole ascidian genome is 0.721, which shows
satisfactory agreement with the value used in the preceding study. The barycenters for all the species are
tabulated (Table 1) and four of them are drawn on the
line graphs of the CpG scores (Figure 1).
Using the method described in the Methods section,
we then calculated the lengths of methylated and
unmethylated regions for all the species. Because the
scatter of the length values is also an indicator of the
extent of the mosaic pattern, we also calculated
the standard deviations of the lengths (Table 1). As
expected, there are consistent tendencies observed along
the phylogenetic tree of the deuterostomes [21]. The
more primitive the organism, the shorter are the methylated regions and the longer are the unmethylated
regions. The more primitive the organisms, the smaller
are the standard deviations of the lengths of methylated
regions and the larger are the standard deviations of the
lengths of the unmethylated regions (Figure 5). To
introduce more readable indices, we divided the lengths
or standard deviations of the unmethylated regions by
those of the methylated regions. The more primitive the
organisms, the larger are both of these ratios (Table 1).
The two ratios are approximately 1.0 for the ascidian
genome, in which the amounts of methylated and
unmethylated are similar. The DNA methylation pattern
of the sea urchin genome has a length ratio of 1.803
and a standard deviation ratio of 3.024, so it might be
patchy rather than mosaic.
The boundary, the ratio of lengths, and the ratio of standard deviations can be used to compare global DNA
methylation patterns numerically and objectively. We
developed software to calculate these three indices for any
genomic sequences. Both CGI and stand-alone versions
are available at http://epigenetics.hgc.jp/mosaicglobal/.
Using this software, we calculated the three indices for

chicken (Figure 5). We also obtained the indices for five
additional fishes: Petromyzon marinus (sea lamprey), Oryzias latipes (Japanese medaka), Gasterosteus aculeatus
(three-spined stickleback), Takifugu rubripes (torafugu),
and Tetraodon nigroviridis (spotted green pufferfish). Intriguingly, the two ratios show a wide range of values in
these non-tetrapod vertebrates (Table 2). Finally, we
obtained the indices for other mammalian genomes. At

this point, we have analyzed all deuterostome genomes
available at http://genome.ucsc.edu/ (Figure 5).

Discussion
A bimodal distribution of CpG scores has been reported
for mouse and human promoter sequences [11,22,23].
However, when we turn our attention to their distribution in the whole genome, the distribution of unmethylated regions, i.e., CpG islands, is negligible and is
clearly covered by the distribution of the methylated

regions (Figure 3). In the present study, we have demonstrated that the distributions of the methylated and
unmethylated regions in whole genomes can be represented by the composition of the two discrete normal
distributions. This is supported by experimental data
(Figure 4) and overlaying the two distributions produces
a better fit. It is not easy to predict DNA methylation
levels from local genomic sequences only. Moreover, the
status can differ depending on developmental stage,
tissue, and cell type. Nevertheless, the implication of the
present findings is that the overall patterns formed by
sets of each methylation status can be stochastically estimated by fitting them to two normal distributions. This
computational methodology allowed us to observe the
transition to the global DNA methylation pattern during
deuterostome evolution. Evolutionary changes in
5-methylcytocine levels have been investigated in detail
and in a large number of species [24]. However, what
we have observed here are not average levels but the
transition of patterns that are formed by methylated and
unmethylated regions.
It has been widely believed that cephalochordates,
including lancelets, are more closely related to vertebrates than to urochordates, represented by ascidians
[25]. This view may have caused researchers to overlook
the gradual transition in the DNA methylation pattern,
even though they observed higher levels of methylation
in the ascidian than in the lancelet [5]. Recent studies of
chordate genomes have changed the conventional consensus [26,27]. Currently, both urochordates and vertebrates are thought to have evolved from a common
ancestor of cephalochordate-like organisms. Consistent
with this, our results indicate a firm direction in the
changes in the methylation pattern during evolution,
based on the assumption that lower organisms have
relatively better retained their primitive features than
higher ones.

To take a closer look at this transition, we focused on
six fish species. The existence of CpG islands in
fish genomes is unclear, but an analysis of evidencebased transcription start sites has clearly shown that,
like mammals, there are a large number of promoterassociated CpG islands in the medaka genome [28].
However, because sequence features, including the G+C
and CpG contents, seem to vary considerably among
fishes, the definition of fish CpG islands is still controversial [29]. Adjustable criteria that do not rely on ad
hoc thresholds may be required to define standardized
CpG islands among highly divergent species. In the present study, CpG islands were not considered because
we wanted to give organisms lacking CpG islands equal
attention. Instead, the boundaries between methylated
and unmethylated regions were defined by analyzing the
CpG-score distributions, species by species. Although
the indices obtained showed a wide range, they are consistent with the piscine phylogeny (Figure 2) [30], and
are situated between those of invertebrates and tetrapods, supporting a gradual transition in the methylation
pattern (Table 2). The two pufferfish genomes show
exceptionally high ratios. This could be attributable to
their excessively reduced genomes relative to those of
other vertebrates [31]. A similar tendency was also
observed in platypus, which is a mammal that exhibits
some characteristics of reptiles, probably because of the
unique character of its genomic sequence [32]. Exceptionally high ratios observed in cat could be ascribed to
its low coverage of 1.9 fold (Figure 5) [33]. Its finished
sequences are eagerly awaited to know the bona fide
causes. We intend to examine the causes of these discrepancies. The genomes of increasing numbers of
organisms have been sequenced [34]. The boundary and
the indices used to estimate the extent of the global
methylation pattern will be fundamental values in future
comparative studies.

Conclusions
In mammals, DNA methylation is essential for normal
development [12,16,35]. A wave of de novo methylation
occurs globally around the time of implantation. Interestingly, we observed a transition to the global DNA methylation pattern from the invertebrates to mammals. These
facts recall Haeckel’s dictum “Ontogeny recapitulates
phylogeny.” From our computational analysis, it appears

that the establishment of global DNA methylation during
ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny. Although the methodology is in part supported by experimental data, our
conclusion must be confirmed experimentally. The distributions of CpG scores, which are the fundamental data
in the present study, might be the consequences of the
spontaneous deamination of methylated CpG sites, rather
than the cause of the established methylation levels. The

methylation and unmethylation signals of various deuterostomes are yet to be identified in DNA methylation analyses. They are eagerly awaited. However, by using a new
computational methodology, our study has shed light on
the unexplored molecular evolution of epigenetics.

observed number to the expected number of CpG, called
the “CpG score” in this paper, was calculated using 2-kb
fixed lengths, with no space between two adjacent windows [36]. If a window contained more than 50 undetermined or ambiguous nucleotides, it was discarded. A
large number of 2-kb sequences spanning gaps were also
discarded under this criterion. Most of the analyses in
this study were performed using Perl scripts, which are
available upon request.
Compulsory decomposition of the bimodal CpG-score
distributions

The compulsory decomposition of the bimodal CpGscore distributions was performed with the NOCOM
software [37]. Our software, designed to calculate the
extent of the global methylation pattern, also includes

DNA methylation data for the human and ascidian
genomes

We used the DNA methylation data of Human Epigenome Project Release 26th June 2006 [19,20]. We used
sliding 2-kb windows without any overlap, to avoid
including gapped regions. We considered windows with
average DNA methylation levels 70%-100% and 0%-30%
as hypermethylated and hypomethylated regions, respectively. For the ascidian genome, we used data obtained
with methylation-sensitive PCR for two 1-Mb genomic
regions [9]. The genomic coordinates of the 2-kb
windows and their methylation status are tabulated
(Additional file 1: Table S1).
Estimation of the extent of the global DNA methylation
pattern

We used the barycenter of the two decomposed normal
distributions as the boundary of the methylated and
unmethylated regions. In this way, every sliding window
of 2 kb, moved in steps of 100 bp, was assigned to one of
the two regions, producing binary data for each 100 bp
covering the whole genomes. To smooth the binary data,
a 2-kb sliding window analysis was performed again and
the methylation status was decided based on whether
methylation was dominant over unmethylation or vice
versa. Consecutive statuses were clustered into a methylated or unmethylated region and the whole set of the
lengths was used for the final statistical analysis to estimate the extent of global methylation pattern.
Additional material
Additional file 1: Table S1. The genomic coordinates and their
methylation status for the ascidian DNA methylation analysis. The
ci2 chromosome name, start position, end position, methylation status,
and CpG score are tabulated. Methylated and unmethylated statuses are
represented by 1 and 0, respectively.
