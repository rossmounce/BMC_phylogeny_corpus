Analysis of common bean expressed sequence
tags identifies sulfur metabolic pathways active in
seed and sulfur-rich proteins highly expressed in
the absence of phaseolin and major lectins

Abstract
Background: A deficiency in phaseolin and phytohemagglutinin is associated with a near doubling of sulfur amino
acid content in genetically related lines of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), particularly cysteine, elevated by 70%,
and methionine, elevated by 10%. This mostly takes place at the expense of an abundant non-protein amino acid,
S-methyl-cysteine. The deficiency in phaseolin and phytohemagglutinin is mainly compensated by increased levels
of the 11S globulin legumin and residual lectins. Legumin, albumin-2, defensin and albumin-1 were previously
identified as contributing to the increased sulfur amino acid content in the mutant line, on the basis of similarity
to proteins from other legumes.
Results: Profiling of free amino acid in developing seeds of the BAT93 reference genotype revealed a biphasic
accumulation of gamma-glutamyl-S-methyl-cysteine, the main soluble form of S-methyl-cysteine, with a lag phase
occurring during storage protein accumulation. A collection of 30,147 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) was
generated from four developmental stages, corresponding to distinct phases of gamma-glutamyl-S-methyl-cysteine
accumulation, and covering the transitions to reserve accumulation and dessication. Analysis of gene ontology
categories indicated the occurrence of multiple sulfur metabolic pathways, including all enzymatic activities
responsible for sulfate assimilation, de novo cysteine and methionine biosynthesis. Integration of genomic and
proteomic data enabled the identification and isolation of cDNAs coding for legumin, albumin-2, defensin D1 and
albumin-1A and -B induced in the absence of phaseolin and phytohemagglutinin. Their deduced amino acid
sequences have a higher content of cysteine than methionine, providing an explanation for the preferential
increase of cysteine in the mutant line.
Conclusion: The EST collection provides a foundation to further investigate sulfur metabolism and the differential
accumulation of sulfur amino acids in seed of common bean. Identification of sulfur-rich proteins whose levels are
elevated in seed lacking phaseolin and phytohemagglutinin and sulfur metabolic genes may assist the
improvement of protein quality.

Background
Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is the most important
leguminous food crop grown for dry seed worldwide,
both in acreage and yield. Historically, this species has
been an important model for the study of seed storage
proteins [1]. In commercial cultivars, the 7S globulin

phaseolin constitutes approximately half of total seed
protein. Lectins are also abundant, with phytohemagglutinins and a-amylase inhibitors accounting for 10% and
5% of seed protein, respectively. Like in other grain
legumes, the content of essential sulfur amino acids is
sub-optimal for nutrition. A strategy proposed to
improve protein quality and bioavailability of sulfur
amino acids consists in the selection and breeding of
highly-digestible phaseolin types [2]. A different approach
may rely on variation in storage protein composition.

Osborn et al. developed genetically related lines integrating mutations conferring a deficiency in phaseolin
and major lectins, which are encoded by unique loci [3].
The arcelin-phytohemagglutinin-a-amylase inhibitor
(APA) locus was introgressed from G12882, a wild
accession containing arcelin-1, into the commercial cultivar Sanilac (white navy bean), to generate the SARC1
line. Recessive mutations from Phaseolus coccineus and
‘Great Northern 1140’ were introgressed into the
SARC1 background, conferring a deficiency in phaseolin
and lectins, respectively. SMARC1-PN1 lacks phaseolin
and SMARC1N-PN1 lacks phaseolin, phytohemagglutinin and arcelin. SARC1, SMARC1-PN1 and SMARC1NPN1 share a similar level (ca. 85%) of the recurrent parental Sanilac background. Introgression of the APA
locus containing arcelin-1 from wild P. vulgaris is associated with resistance to major storage pests, the weevils
Zabrotes subfasciatus and Acanthoscelides obtectus [4-6].
However, in the absence of detailed molecular information about the APA locus, the identity of the lectin(s)
conferring this resistance remains elusive [7,8].
The deficiency in phaseolin and major lectins, phytohemagglutinin and arcelin, results in a nearly two-fold
increase in sulfur amino acid content in seed, particularly of Cys, elevated by 70%, and Met, by 10% [9]. This
takes place mostly at the expense of S-methyl-Cys, an
abundant non-protein amino acid which cannot substitute for Met or Cys in the diet [10]. Proteomic analysis
revealed that the lack of phaseolin and major lectins was
mainly compensated by increases in the 11S globulin
legumin and residual lectins, particularly the b subunit
of a-amylase inhibitor-1, a-amylase inhibitor-like protein, mannose lectin FRIL, and leucoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin encoded by PDLEC2 [11]. Several
proteins contributing to the increased Cys content
including legumin, albumin-2, defensin and albumin-1
were identified on the basis of similarity to related proteins from other legumes. Based on quantification by 2D gel electrophoresis, legumin levels were raised by 3fold, to 17% of total protein, while albumin-2 was elevated by 10-fold, to 1.2% of total protein. Defensin and
albumin-1 could not be quantified accurately as they
were characterized from selective extracts.
A significant number of expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) have been generated from root, leaf and pod of
common bean [12-17], but a similar resource is lacking
for the seed, despite its nutritional importance. In addition, transcript profiling studies of common bean using
high density arrays have so far relied on cross-specific
hybridization to soybean platforms [18,19], in part due
to a lack of relevant sequence information. The objective
of this study was to generate a common bean EST collection which would provide a foundation to further
investigate the metabolism of sulfur amino acids in

developing seeds, by using a functional genomic
approach. Four seed developmental stages were sampled
in the reference genotype BAT93 [20], corresponding to
distinct stages of accumulation of g-Glu-S-methyl-Cys,
the major soluble form of S-methyl-Cys. In silico analysis revealed the occurrence of several pathways of sulfur
metabolism ranging from sulfate assimilation to (homo)
glutathione biosynthesis. Analysis of EST clusters provided detailed information on the identity and abundance of storage protein transcripts. Integration with
proteomic data enabled isolation of cDNAs coding for
legumin, albumin-2, defensin and albumin-1 isoforms
which are elevated in the absence of phaseolin and
major lectins. These proteins have a higher Cys than
Met content, providing an explanation for the preferential increase of Cys in SMARC1N-PN1.

Results
Selection of seed developmental stages and generation
of ESTs

Free amino acids were profiled at eight developmental
stages of BAT93 seed, to identify stages suitable to generate ESTs (see Additional File 1). Developmental stages
are designated after Walbot et al. [21]. According to this
nomenclature, storage protein transcripts reach their
maximal levels between stages IV (cotyledon) to VI
(maturation), while storage products are accumulated
between stages V (cotyledon) to VII (maturation) [22].
During stage VIII (maturation) the seed undergoes desiccation. Amino acid content was normalized over the
average of developmental stages, expressed in log2 scale,
and k-means analysis performed to reveal common developmental patterns. Amino acids were grouped into five
clusters (Figure 1). The levels of most free amino acids
decreased markedly between stages V to VII during
which protein reserves are actively accumulated. The
nitrogen-rich amino acids, Arg, His and Lys formed a
cluster with Phe. Amino acids in this cluster were characterized by a marked rise in their levels during the transition to seed desiccation and dormancy. The second and
third clusters contained central intermediates in amino
acid metabolism, Ser, Glu, Ala, Gln and Asn, along with
Leu and Met. Their levels generally decreased throughout
seed development. This decline was more pronounced
for amino acids in the third cluster which included Met.
g-Glu-S-methyl-Cys and g-Glu-Leu formed a unique
cluster as their levels rose throughout seed development.
g-Glu-S-methyl-Cys showed a biphasic curve of accumulation, with a continuous rise until stage V, followed by a
plateau until stage VII, and a resumption of accumulation
from stage VIII (see Additional file 1, Figure 1). In comparison, the levels of free S-methyl-Cys were high at
stages III and IV, and decreased at stages V and VI, in
parallel with Met levels.

V - cotyledon (16 DAF, 48 mg seed weight), coinciding
with early g-Glu-S-methyl-Cys accumulation, stage VI maturation (21 DAF, 164 mg seed weight), coinciding
with the lag phase, and stage VIII - maturation (30
DAF, 380 mg seed weight), coinciding with the resumption of accumulation. A total of 8,725, 9,537, 5,260 and
6,625 ESTs were generated for each respective developmental stage. Of these, Gene Ontology (GO) annotation
from Arabidopsis [23] was retrieved for 5,511, 3,825,
1,561 and 3,303 ESTs, respectively. Assembly of the
total 30,147 ESTs yielded 3,658 contigs and 6,027
singletons.
In silico analysis of ESTs identifies features of sulfur and
amino acid metabolism in developing seeds

Figure 1 Cluster analysis of free amino acid profiles during
seed development. Amino acids were classified using k-means
analysis into five groups. The names of amino acids belonging to
each group are indicated on the right. Data on the y axis is the
amino acid content (see Additional file 1) normalized to the average
and expressed in log2 scale. Developmental stages are named
according to Walbot et al. [21]. Timing of phaseolin (Phs) and
phytohemagglutinin (Pha) transcript and phaseolin protein
accumulation is according to Bobb et al. [22].

Four developmental stages were selected to generate
ESTs, corresponding to distinct phases of g-Glu-Smethyl-Cys accumulation: stage IV - cotyledon [14 days
after fertilization (DAF), 29 mg seed weight] and stage

The representation of general GO categories of biological
process and molecular function was analyzed during seed
development. The percentage of ESTs assigned to a GO
category (see Additional file 2) was normalized to the
average over seed development, expressed in log2 scale
and submitted to hierarchical clustering analysis (Figure
2). Categories of cellular metabolism, primary metabolism, macromolecule metabolism and cellular protein
metabolism clustered together. Their representation suggested that general metabolic activity was highest at stage
IV, progressively decreased until stage VI and then
increased at stage VIII. The same general trend was
observed for the categories of amino acid and sulfur
compound metabolic processes. The decline in metabolic
activity coincided with accumulation of storage products.
Indeed, the nutrient reservoir activity category was most
highly represented at stage VI, followed by stage V. The
latter clustered away from all other categories. Hormone
biosynthesic process also had a unique profile, being
highest at the first stage of development and markedly
down at the last two stages. The percentage of ESTs
assigned to the category of photosynthesis was highest at
stage IV, followed by stage V, and further decreased at
stages VI and VIII, consistent with the loss of chlorophyll
pigmentation in cotyledons during seed maturation [21].
Interestingly, categories of photosynthesis, response to
oxidative stress and response to radiation were grouped
together. The category of response to water deprivation
had highest levels at stage VIII, corresponding to seed
desiccation. Analysis of GO categories related to the supply of nitrogen to developing seeds indicated that ureide
catabolism, comprising allantoinase and allantoicase
activities, was most highly represented at stage V, coinciding with the onset of storage protein accumulation,
whereas the percentage of ESTs associated with asparaginase activity increased steadily until stage VI, the midpoint of storage protein accumulation (Figure 3A).
Five different GO categories were associated with Arg
metabolism (Figure 3B). Of these, argininosuccinate

lyase activity, the last step in Arg biosynthesis, was
represented by a high percentage of ESTs at stage IV, of
0.80%. This correlates with an increase in steady-stage
Arg levels between stages III to V (see Additional File
1). Analysis of categories related to sulfur metabolism
indicated that all enzymatic activities associated with
sulfur assimilation, de novo Cys and Met biosynthesis
were represented in the EST dataset (Figure 4). These
include sulfate adenylyltransferase, adenylyl-sulfate
reductase and sulfite reductase; Ser O-acetyltransferase
and Cys synthase; and cystathionine g-synthase,
cystathionine b-lyase and Met synthase. Homocysteine
S-methyltransferase, involved in the production of Met
via the S-methylmethionine cycle, the catabolic enzyme
Met g-lyase and the two enzymes involved in (homo)
glutathione biosynthesis, Glu-Cys ligase and (homo)glutathione synthase, were also represented.
Analysis of seed protein ESTs

Clustering of ESTs is an efficient tool to estimate the
identity and abundance of transcripts in a complex
mRNA sample. This analysis focused on the sulfur-poor
7S globulin phaseolin and lectins, the most abundant
seed proteins in commercial cultivars [1], and on the
sulfur-rich 11S globulins, 2S albumins, and defensins
whose levels are elevated in the absence of phaseolin
and phytohemagglutinin [11]. To identify contigs coding
for sulfur-rich proteins induced in mature seed of
SMARC1N-PN1, conceptual translations of sequences
were compared with de novo sequenced peptides from
previously obtained liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data [11]. Corresponding
cDNAs were isolated.
Sulfur-poor 7S globulin phaseolin and lectins

Within this subset, most ESTs were derived from the
genes encoding the a- and b-subunit of S-type phaseolin,
which differ by the presence of a 27 base pair insertion,
and are present in cultivated varieties representative of
the Mesoamerican gene pool [24,25] (Figure 5). The lectin encoded by lec4-B17 and phytohemagglutinin
encoded by pha-E [26] were the next most highly represented, followed by a-amylase inhibitor-1 [27] and aamylase inhibitor-like protein [28]. Fewer ESTs were
observed for the leucoagglutinating phytohemagglutinin
encoded by PDLEC2 [29], and an additional phytohemagglutinin previously isolated from an arcelin-5 genotype
[30]. The phytohemagglutinin encoded by pha-L [26] and
mannose lectin FRIL [31], previously identified in SARC1
and SMARC1N-PN1 [11], were not represented in the
BAT93 EST dataset. Conversely, the arcelin-5 phytohemagglutinin was not previously identified in SARC1 or
SMARC1N-PN1 [11]. There was no evidence for additional phaseolin or lectin transcripts in BAT93. The phytohemagglutinins identified here are encoded by distinct

Page 6 of 17

genes, as they share only between 80 to 87% identity in
their deduced amino acid sequence.
Sulfur-rich 11S globulins, 2S albumins and defensins

Among sulfur-rich proteins, clustering of ESTs yielded
three legumin, three albumin-2, four defensin and eleven albumin-1 contigs or singletons. Within each protein type, the isoform induced in SMARC1N-PN1 was
encoded by the most highly represented contig in the
BAT93 EST collection (Figure 5).
The major legumin cDNA encodes a protein of 606
amino acids (Figure 6). Removal of the signal peptide,
spanning residues 1 to 23, generates a precursor with a
predicted molecular weight of 66.3 kD. Cleavage after
the conserved Asn427 residue gives rise to an acidic asubunit, with a predicted molecular weight of 46.4 kD
and pI of 5.45, and a b-subunit, with a predicted molecular weight of 19.8 kD and pI of 7.03. The a-subunit
contains a Glu-rich domain, spanning positions 260 to
415. Conventional N-terminal and de novo peptide
sequencing support the location of the cleavage sites
[11,32]. De novo sequenced tryptic peptides from replicate samples of 2-D gel spots [11] covered 48 and 79%
of the deduced sequences of the a- and b-subunits,
respectively (Figure 6 and see Additional file 3A). The P.
vulgaris legumin amino acid sequence shares 54 and
41% identity with glycinin A5A4B3 from Glycine max
and arachin 5 from Arachis hypogaea [33], respectively,
but is more similar in length to arachin 5. Phylogenetic
analysis indicated that the P. vulgaris protein belongs to
a group of 11S globulins from legumes, comprising Btype, Met-poor legumins from Vicia species [34] (Figure
7). The P. vulgaris legumin is part of a subgroup of high
molecular weight legumins which includes group-2 glycinins from soybean [35], arachin 5, legumin storage
proteins 2 and -3 from Lotus japonicus [36], the minor
small legumin from Pisum sativum [37] and leguminrelated high molecular weight polypeptide from Vicia
faba [38]. Members of this subgroup are characterized
by an extended C-terminal half of the a-subunit arising
by expansion and mutation of a sequence repeat.
The albumin-2 cDNA encodes a protein of 277 amino
acids with 80% identity to a seed albumin from Vigna
radiata and 49% identity to albumin-2 from P. sativum
[39] (Figure 8A). The protein contains four hemopexinlike repeats implicated in polyamine binding [40]. De
novo sequenced tryptic peptides from replicate samples
of 2-D gel spots covered 74% of the deduced sequence
of the mature polypeptide (Figure 8A and see Additional
file 3B) [11]. The de novo sequencing data indicated that
the N-terminal Met residue is absent in the mature
polypeptide.
The defensin highly expressed in SMARC1N-PN1 had
been previously identified on the basis of its similarity
to a defensin from Cicer arietinum [11]. However,

precursors give rise to chains b (residues 28 to 64) and
a (residues 73 to 124) [45]. The b chain is arranged in a
knottin-fold containing three b-strands held by three
disulfide bridges [46,47]. The peptide previously de novo
sequenced spans residues 49 to 63 of the b chain [11].
The presence of an Arg at position 63 generates a tryptic site unique to albumin-1A and -B, among the albumin-1 isoforms represented in the EST dataset.
Availability of cloned cDNAs provides information
about the sulfur amino acid content of sulfur-rich proteins whose levels are elevated in SMARC1N-PN1. The
mature legumin subunits contain 0.9% of their residues
as Cys and 0.7% as Met. Mature albumin-2 contains
1.3% of Cys and 0.4% of Met. Mature defensin D1 is
particularly rich in Cys at 17% and lacks Met residues.
The mature albumin-1A and -B subunits have a Cys
content of 11%, and a Met content of 3.3 and 2.2%,
respectively.

associated tryptic peptide sequences actually belong to
antifungal defensin D1 from P. vulgaris [41], whose partial cDNA and N-terminal amino acid sequences were
absent from databases. The defensin D1 cDNA isolated
here encodes a precursor of 75 residues with 93% identity to defensin D2 from V. radiata [42]. The mature
peptide is characterized by a Cys-stabilized ab motif,
consisting of three b-strands and one a-helix held by
four disulfide bridges. The two tryptic peptides previously identified [11], spanning positions 30 to 39 and
40 to 53, are the only ones within range of detection by
the mass spectrometer. The second most abundant contig, and associated defensin D2 cDNA, encode a precursor polypeptide with 93% identity to a defensin from
Vigna unguiculata. Defensins D1 and -2 are 37% identical in amino acid sequence.
Two albumin-1 cDNAs, albumin-1A and -B may
encode the methanol-soluble albumin-1 highly
expressed in SMARC1N-PN1. Their deduced amino
acid sequences are 97% identical. They encode polypeptide precursors of 127 amino acids with 88% identity to
a partial albumin-1 from P. vulgaris [43], and 71% identity to albumin-1 from G. max [44] (Figure 8B). The

To further characterize legumin, this protein was purified
from SMARC1N-PN1 by targeting the most abundant 2D gel spots, 78 to 80 (59-64 kD and pI value of 5.5-5.6),
corresponding to its a-subunit and representing 10% of
total protein [11]. The apparent pI value was used to
select conditions for purification by ion exchange chromatography. Fractions were screened by SDS-PAGE for
bands having the appropriate molecular weight. Ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by ion exchange
chromatography yielded two fractions of interest, characterized by size exclusion chromatography. Proteins were
identified after in-gel trypsin digestion and LC-MS. The
first fraction contained group 3 late embryogenesis abundant protein with an apparent molecular weight of 56.0
kD (Figure 9A; see Additional file 3C). In 2-D gels, this
protein migrated to spots 84 (64 kD and pI value of 5.4)
and 104 (55 kD and pI value 5.4-5.5), having apparent
molecular weight and pI values close to those of the legumin a-subunit. The native molecular weight of group 3
late embryogenesis abundant protein was measured as
494 ± 2 kD (average ± standard deviation; n = 3), suggesting a multimer of nine identical subunits. The second
fraction contained the legumin polypeptide precursor, aand b-subunits, with apparent molecular weights of 73.4,
54.8 and 21.9 kD respectively (Figure 9C; see Additional
file 3D-F). Two minor bands, of 44.0 and 42.7 kD were
also identified as the a-subunit (see Additional file 3G).
Detection of the mass of a tryptic peptide, 423NRGSNGIEETLCTLK-437, containing an intact cleavage
site was characteristic of the precursor. A complex pattern of elution was observed after size exclusion chromatography (Figure 9B and 9C). A first peak contained all
three major polypeptides, with a molecular weight of 704
± 36 kD, suggesting possible associations between trimers

second peak contained the a-subunit alone, with a molecular weight of 282 ± 2 kD, suggesting a hexamer. Recovery of the a-subunit alone may be related to the
inclusion of reducing agent during purification.

Discussion
Profiling of free amino acids in BAT93 seeds enabled a
rational selection of developmental stages to generate
ESTs, which correspond to distinct phases of g-Glu-Smethyl-Cys accumulation. Analysis of general GO

categories related to primary metabolism, photosynthesis, response to water deficit and nutrient reservoir
activity validated the representativeness of ESTs at the
different stages. Free amino acid and GO category profiles confirm and extend the findings of Fait et al. [48]
on the metabolic transitions to storage product accumulation and desiccation in Arabidopsis seeds. They highlighted a decrease in the levels of free amino acids,
particularly Asn, Gln and Lys, during reserve accumulation, indicative of metabolic transformations and efficient incorporation into storage proteins. Nitrogen-rich

their role as a nitrogen source to support germination

was true of aromatic amino acids, Trp, Phe and Tyr,
which may support the biosynthesis of shikimate-derived
compounds for defense and indole-acetic acid during

enzymes of primary metabolism examined had reduced
levels during the active phase of reserve accumulation.
The biphasic accumulation of g-Glu-S-methyl-Cys is
consistent with a function of S-methyl-Cys as a storage
form of excess sulfur. During the lag phase, incorporation of sulfur amino acids into storage proteins may efficiently compete with the biosynthesis of S-methyl-Cys.
Based on the high levels of free S-methyl-Cys detected
at stages III and IV, substantial flux through this metabolite may lead to accumulation in the g-glutamyl
dipeptide form. The rise in Arg levels between stages III
to V suggests a transient accumulation of nitrogen into
this nitrogen-rich amino acid in anticipation of active
storage protein accumulation. This increase may be
mediated by arginosuccinate lyase activity, whose transcript is overrepresented during stage IV.
Analysis of GO categories related to sulfur metabolism
revealed the occurrence of complete pathways of sulfate
assimilation, de novo Cys and Met biosynthesis. Similar
findings have been reported for soybean seed [49]. These
data may be interpreted in relation with current understanding of the sulfur nutrition of legume seed. The main
sources of sulfur transported to the seed are expected to
be S-methylmethionine [50] and homoglutathione [51].
In soybean, most sulfate appears to be converted to
homoglutathione in the pod, prior to uptake by developing cotyledons, although some is detected in developing
seed [52]. However, under sulfur-limiting conditions, glutathione exclusively, and no sulfate, is translocated to the
seed, according to a model developed in wheat [51].
Interestingly, Arabidopsis knock-out mutants of sulfate
transporters that have been characterized so far show
increased sulfate content in mature seed, suggesting a
function in intracellular transport rather than uptake by
the embryo [53,54]. Beside the generation of sulfide for
de novo Cys biosynthesis, the sulfate assimilatory pathway
is required for the biosynthesis of the activated nucleotide 3’-phospho-5’-adenosinephosphosulfate, the universal donor in sulfate transfer reactions. Adenylyl-sulfate
kinase activity, forming 3’-phospho-5’-adenosinephosphosulfate, which competes with adenylyl-sulfate reductase for its substrate, was represented in the EST dataset
(Figure 4). Cystathionine g-synthase and -b-lyase likely
provide homocysteine as an acceptor for methyl transfer
from S-methylmethionine, catalyzed by homocysteine Smethyltransferase [55], while Met synthase is essential to
recycle homocysteine produced in the S-adenosylmethionine cycle, which appeared highly active according to the
high representation of the Met adenosyltransferase activity category. Further research is required to fully understand the significance of the sulfate assimilatory pathway,
and the relative contributions of de novo Cys and Met
biosynthesis in seed metabolism.

arrows mark cleavage sites of polypeptide precursors. Horizontal bars indicate de novo sequenced tryptic peptides from 2-D gel spots and SDSPAGE bands from methanol soluble extracts (see Additional file 3B) [11]. Species codes are as in Figures 6 and 7 and also includes: Vr, V. radiata.

Previous results have shown that the absence of Cyspoor phaseolin and phytohemagglutinin in SMARC1NPN1 leads to a shift of sulfur from S-methyl-Cys to the
protein Cys pool [9]. By integrating proteomic and EST
data, the deduced sequences of several proteins contributing to the increased levels of sulfur amino acids in
SMARC1N-PN1 were identified. These proteins have a
higher Cys than Met content, providing an explanation
for the preferential increase in Cys over Met in the
mutant line.
Legumin is found at relatively low levels of ca. 3% of
seed protein in common bean cultivars, as compared
with other grain legumes [32]. Identification of its

deduced amino acid sequence establishes that it is a
member of the high molecular weight 11S globulins.
The mechanism leading to the evolution of high molecular weight 11S globulins involves expansion of a
repeat sequence at the C-terminal end of the a-subunit.
The sequences of these repeats differ between P. vulgaris legumin, arachin 5 and glycinin A5A4B3 (Figure
6). Legumin has four instances of the sequence NH2 HKEEEKEVEPLP-COOH, compared with four of the
sequence NH 2-GYDDD[E/D]RRP-COOH and eight of
the sequence NH2 -DDD[E/D]RR-COOH in arachin 5.
Glycinin A5A4B3 has three repeats of the sequence
NH 2 -QDEDEDEDED-COOH, compared with two in

glycinin A4B3 [56]. The first instance of this sequence,
spanning positions 258 to 268 of legumin, is relatively
well conserved but not repeated in legumin and arachin
5. These observations suggest that expansion of repeats
probably occurred, at least in part, after the separation
of the lineages leading to the three species.
Purification of legumin revealed substantial accumulation of the propolypeptide in SMARC1N-PN1. A similar
finding has been reported in transgenic soybean where
the expression of the a-and a’-subunits of the 7S globulin a-conglycinin was suppressed [57]. Interestingly, the
proglycinin was shown to be trafficked directly from the
ER to the vacuole, whereas mature 11S globulins transit
in the Golgi apparatus. In most legume crops, a-subunits of 11S globulins have an apparent molecular weight
of approximately 40 kD. By contrast, P. vulgaris and V.
unguiculata [58] share a single, dominant high molecular weight legumin whose a-subunit has an apparent
molecular weight of approximately 60 kD. Similarly, in
L. japonicus, two of three major legumins, the legumin
storage proteins 2 and -3, which are closely related to
the P. vulgaris legumin, have a-subunit apparent molecular weights of 55 and 60 kD, respectively [36]. In G.
max, an additional cleavage site in proglycinin gives rise
to A5 and A4 subunits, having a reduced molecular
weight [56]. The significance of the 10 kD difference
between the predicted and apparent molecular weight of
the major legumin a-subunit, and the detection of
minor a-subunit polypeptides of 44.0 and 42.6 kD is
unclear. The minor polypeptides may represent partial
degradation products, and the discrepancy in molecular
weight may be due to an effect of the Glu-rich domain
on electrophoretic behavior. Alternatively, these differences may arise by a possible post-translational modification of the mature a-subunit. The absence of this
modification in prolegumin, whose predicted and apparent molecular weight is similar, would reflect differences
in trafficking, as already noted in soybean. Among high
molecular weight legumins in other legume crops, the
a-subunit of P. sativum minor small legumin accumulates only as degradation products ranging from 21 to
32 kD, which was interpreted as an outcome of early
mobilization [59], while only the b-subunit of arachin 5
was identified in the mature seed proteome of A. hypogaea [60].
Although phaseolin and lectins have been characterized in great detail, the number and identity of genes
encoding these proteins is still unknown. In the present
study, there was evidence for only two phaseolin genes
in the BAT93 EST dataset. Beside the APA locus on
linkage group B4, two lectin loci have been mapped on
linkage group B7 [61,62]. EST, proteomic [11], cDNA
[26] and genomic sequence data [62] can be integrated
to provide information on the composition of the APA

Page 12 of 17

locus in different P. vulgaris genotypes. In BAT93 and
ARC5 genotypes, a gene order consisting in lec4-B17/
pha-E/phytohemagglutinin/a-amylase inhibitor-like protein can be inferred. In ARC1, arc3 and arc4 genotypes,
the arcelin-5 phytohemagglutinin appears to be substituted with pha-L. PDLEC2 encoding leucoagglutinating
phytohemagglutinin, isolated from a phytohemagglutinin-deficient Pinto cultivar [29], whose expression is elevated in SMARC1N-PN1, may be one of the lectin
genes located outside of the APA locus.

Conclusions
The BAT93 EST collection provides a foundation to
initiate further studies of sulfur amino acid metabolism
in developing seed, as all relevant pathways and enzyme
activities are represented. The results presented here are
consistent with a mechanism whereby sulfur can be efficiently partitioned between S-methyl-Cys and Cys, but
its metabolic basis is not understood. The identification
and characterization of sulfur-rich proteins whose levels
are increased in the absence of phaseolin and major lectins provides an explanation for the preferential increase
in Cys over Met.
Methods
Plant material and growth conditions

BAT93, a line representative of the Mesoamerican gene
pool of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) [20], was
grown as previously described [63]. Developing seed
samples were harvested randomly from about twenty
plants. SMARC1N-PN1 [3] was grown in the field in
London, ON, in 2008.
Extraction and quantification of free amino acids

Amino acids were extracted and quantified by HPLC
after derivatization with phenylisothiocyanate as previously described [9], except that extraction was performed in ethanol:water (70:30), which is optimal for
sulfur containing g-glutamyl dipeptides [64]. Replicate
samples consisted in independent pools of eight seeds
which were ground in liquid nitrogen, and 100 mg of
ground tissue was used for extraction. g-Glu-S-methylCys and g-Glu-Leu standards were from Bachem Americas (Torrance, CA).
RNA extraction

RNA was extracted using a modified lithium chloride
precipitation method [63]. RNA was quantified by spectrophotometry on a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific,
Wilmington, DE) and its quality evaluated from A260/280
ratio and agarose gel electrophoresis. Poly A+ RNA was
isolated using the Ambion Poly(A)Purist mRNA purification kit (Applied Biosystems, Streetsville, ON). Its
quality was analyzed with a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent

Yin et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:268
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/268

Technologies, Mississauga, ON) at the London Regional
Genomics Centre, ON.
cDNA library construction

Standard and normalized cDNA libraries were prepared
for each developmental stage. cDNA was synthesized
from 1 μg poly A+ RNA using the SMART cDNA construction kit (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View,
CA). SMART-amplified cDNA was normalized using
the Trimmer-Direct cDNA normalization kit (Evrogen,
Moscow, Russia). SfiI-digested cDNA was purified using
the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Mississauga,
ON). cDNA was size fractionated on a 1% agarose gel
run at 45 V until the bromophenol blue dye was 2 cm
away from the well, and the band was excised in two
fractions corresponding to 0.5 to 1.5 kb and greater
than 1.5 kb. cDNA was extracted using the QIAquick
gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and the two fractions were
ligated separately to a modified pBluescript II KS+ (Agilent) containing SfiI cloning sites. Ligation reactions
were purified using the MinElute reaction cleanup kit
(Qiagen). The ligation product was transformed into
ElectroMAX DH10B T1-phage resistant competent cells
(Invitrogen, Burlington, ON).
EST sequencing and analysis

Culture plates (384-well) were inoculated with a Norgren
Systems CP7200 colony picker (Ronceverte, WV). Plasmids were amplified using TempliPhi (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences, Baie d’Urfé, QC) and cycle sequenced
using Applied Biosystems BigDye chemistry and a BioRAPTR FRD microfluidic workstation (Beckman Coulter
Canada, Mississauga, ON) for amplification and sequencing reaction set-up. Completed 384-well sequencing
plates were processed with Applied Biosystems 3730xl
DNA analyzers. Most clones were sequenced from the 5’
end using M13 Reverse primer; a small number were also
sequenced with the M13-20 primer. EST processing
involved quality-trimming, vector-masking, low-complexity masking, and poly-A trimming using custom perl
scripts. Assembly was performed with TGICL [65] and
the results stored in the FIESTA-2 database at the Plant
Biotechnology Institute of the National Research Council
of Canada. A total of 30,147 ESTs were assembled into
3,658 contigs and 6,027 singletons. Annotation was done
by BLASTx against UniProt Plants version 15 where
accessions with uninformative annotations such as
“unknown protein”, “putative predicted protein”, “shotgun sequence from scaffold”, etc. had been removed
(June 19, 2009) [66]. GO annotations were transferred
from the best BLASTx hit to TAIR version 8 (June 8,
2009) if the e value was smaller than or equal to 1 -10 .
Contigs and singletons reported in Figure 5 were verified
for the absence of cloning or sequencing artifacts.

RACE and cDNA cloning

Total RNA from SMARC1N-PN1 (20 mg seed weight)
was digested with amplification grade DNase I (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was synthesized using ThermoScript RT-PCR system from 1 μg RNA (Invitrogen). 5’
RNA ligase mediated RACE was performed with
Ambion FirstChoice RLM-RACE Kit (Applied Biosystems) using Taq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Pickering, ON). 5’ RACE gene specific outer (O)
and inner (I) primers were the following: for legumin,
Leg-O, 5’ -TCCGCCACCATAAAGTTCTGT-3’ and
Leg-I, 5’-CTAACTTGTCCTTGCCCCTCG-3’; and for
albumin-2, Alb2-O, 5’-TTACATCAGGAAAGGAATCAGGC-3’ and Alb2-I, 5’-TGTTTTGTGACGAGGATAAGGTG-3’. RACE products were either blunted with
the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and cloned
into the Zero Blunt TOPO vector (Invitrogen) or cloned
directly into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI). Full-length cDNAs were cloned by RT-PCR
with Pfx50 DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) into the Zero
Blunt TOPO vector using the following primers: for
legumin, Legumin-F, 5’-ACCAACCCATTCACCACTTC-3’ and Legumin-R, 5’-AAGAAAGGCTTGCTAGGATGG-3’; and for albumin-2, Albumin2-F, 5’-AAGCATCCTCAAATCAAATCA-3’ and Albumin2-R, 5’AACCAAACCACCCACTTTTA-3’. Multiple sequence
alignment and phylogenetic analysis with PHYLIP were
performed as previously described [63]. Triticin was
used as outgroup.
Protein extraction and purification

Soluble protein was extracted from mature seed according to VandenBosch et al. [67], except that 50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5 was replaced with 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
8.0. Protein concentration was measured with the BioRad Protein Assay solution and bovine serum albumin
as standard. Protein precipitated with saturated ammonium sulfate between 50 to 60% (w/v) was dissolved in
50 mM bis-Tris-HCl, pH 6.5 containing 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and desalted on a PD-10 column (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences). The extract was separated by
ion exchange chromatography on a HiPrep 16/10 Q FF
column, using an ÄKTApurifier system (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences). Protein was eluted with a linear gradient
of 0 to 0.5 M NaCl. Purified fractions of interest were
concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-15 centrifugal filter
unit with Ultracel-10 membrane (Millipore, Billerica,
MA) prior to size exclusion chromatography on a
HiLoad Superdex 75 prep grade column (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences) using 50 mM bis-Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl
containing 14 mM 2-mercaptoethanol as buffer. Proteins
were further chromatographed by size exclusion on a
Superose 6 10/300 GL column. Molecular weight was
determined from a plot of the partition coefficient, Kav,

Yin et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:268
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/268

versus the logarithm of the molecular weight of protein
standards. The following proteins were used for calibration: thyroglobulin (669 kD); ferritin (440 kD); and catalase (232 kD).
Protein identification

To confirm protein and cDNA identity, LC-MS/MS data
from 2-D gel spots [11] was used for de novo sequencing with PEAKS Studio v. 4.5 (Bioinformatics Solutions
Inc., Waterloo, ON) [68] as previously described, and
compared to conceptual cDNA translations. Protein
fractions eluted from the HiLoad Superdex 75 prep
grade column, and 44.0 and 42.7 kD legumin a-subunit
present in Superose 6 10/300 GL fractions, were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels. Bands
were excised, digested with trypsin and the resulting
peptides were subjected to LC-MS for protein identification. For group 3 late embryogenesis abundant protein,
and 44.0 and 42.7 kD legumin a-subunits, LC-MS/MS
was performed as previously described for 2-D gel spots
[11], except that the gradient was lengthened to 90 min.
The 44.0 and 42.7 kD legumin a-subunits were identified by Mascot search of the assembled EST database, to
which the legumin cDNA sequence had been appended,
using an in-house server [69]. For the major legumin
bands, peptides were analyzed by LC-MS using an Alliance 2690 HPLC and a model LCT orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters,
Mississauga, ON). Samples were diluted to 100 μL with
100:0.1 (v/v) water-formic acid. A 50 μL portion was
injected into a 100 μL loop attached to a 10 port valve
(VICI Valco Canada, Brockville, ON) and the valve was
switched to permit transfer to a 1 mm ID × 5 mm C18
PepMap 100 trapping column (Dionex, Bannockburn,
IL), using 100:0.1 (v/v) water-formic acid flowing at 0.1
mL/min from an auxiliary high pressure pump. After 10
min transfer/washing, the valve was switched to place
the trapping column in line with a 1 mm ID × 150 mm
C18 PepMap 100 analytical column (Dionex) and the
peptides were eluted with a gradient of water-acetonitrile-formic acid flowing at 30 μL/min. An ACURATE
flow splitter (Dionex) was used to reduce the flow of 0.3
mL/min from the HPLC to this level. Solvent A was
90:10:0.1 (v/v/v) water-acetonitrile-formic acid and solvent B was 10:90:0.1 water-acetonitrile-formic acid. The
gradient conditions were 5 min at 100% A, a linear
increase to 40% B from 5 to 35 min, a 5 min hold at
40% B followed by a return to 100% A at 45 min and a
15 min equilibration time. The column effluent was
transferred to a Megaflow electrospray probe of the
mass spectrometer where the components were ionized
and subsequently analyzed. The ion source was operated
in positive mode with a capillary voltage of 3 kV with
nitrogen as desolvation gas flowing at 250 L/h and

Page 14 of 17

heated to 250°C. Mass spectra were acquired from 85 to
1500 m/z. The cone voltage was switched between 20
and 50 V at 1.1 sec intervals during data acquisition to
permit fragmentation of individual peptides under favorable conditions of chromatographic separation and high
peptide concentration. The LC-MS system was operated
with MassLynx v. 4.0 and calibrated using a mixture of
horse heart myoglobin and trypsinogen. Peak lists were
generated from MassLynx raw data files using Mascot
Distiller v. 2.2.1 (Matrix Science, Boston, MA). Peptide
fragment data for each sample was processed by examining chromatographic peaks for the purity of their 20 V
spectra, combining 50 V spectra across a suitable peak
as representative of fragments of a single peptide and
saving the data as a mass vs. intensity text file. These
text files for the peptides in a sample were manually
combined into a text file in .pkl format representative of
the sample. Peptide mass fingerprint data was analyzed
against the conceptual translation using PAWS (Digilab,
Holliston, MA) and peptide sequence tags derived with
Peaks Studio.
Statistical analysis

K-means and hierarchical clustering was performed with
GeneSpring GX v. 11.5 (Agilent).
