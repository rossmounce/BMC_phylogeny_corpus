Abstract
Background: Most self-pollinating plants are annuals. According to the 'time-limitation'
hypothesis, this association between selfing and the annual life cycle has evolved as a consequence
of strong r-selection, involving severe time-limitation for completing the life cycle. Under this
model, selection from frequent density-independent mortality in ephemeral habitats minimizes
time to flower maturation, with selfing as a trade-off, and / or selection minimizes the time between
flower maturation and ovule fertilization, in which case selfing has a direct fitness benefit.
Predictions arising from this hypothesis were evaluated using phylogenetically-independent
contrasts of several life history traits in predominantly selfing versus outcrossing annuals from a
data base of 118 species distributed across 14 families. Data for life history traits specifically related
to maturation and pollination times were obtained by monitoring the start and completion of
different stages of reproductive development in a greenhouse study of selfing and outcrossing
annuals from an unbiased sample of 25 species involving five pair-wise family comparisons and four
pair-wise genus comparisons.
Results: Selfing annuals in general had significantly shorter plant heights, smaller flowers, shorter
bud development times, shorter flower longevity and smaller seed sizes compared with their
outcrossing annual relatives. Age at first flower did not differ significantly between selfing and
outcrossing annuals.
Conclusions: This is the first multi-species study to report these general life-history differences
between selfers and outcrossers among annuals exclusively. The results are all explained more
parsimoniously by selection associated with time-limitation than by selection associated with
pollinator/mate limitation. The shorter bud development time reported here for selfing annuals is
predicted explicitly by the time-limitation hypothesis for the fitness benefit of selfing (and not by
the alternative 'reproductive assurance' hypothesis associated with pollinator/mate limitation).
Support for the time-limitation hypothesis is also evident from published surveys: whereas selfers
and outcrossers are about equally represented among annual species as a whole, selfers occur in
much higher frequencies among the annual species found in two of the most severely time-limited
habitats where flowering plants grow – deserts and cultivated habitats.

Background
Most flowering plants that are predominantly self-pollinating have an annual life history [1-3]. Interpretations of
this association usually involve one of two main hypotheses. (i) Compared with perennials, annuals may generally accrue greater fitness benefits from selfing through
'reproductive assurance', i.e., because ovules may be generally more outcross-pollen-limited and/or pollen grains
may be more outcross-ovule-limited [2,4-8]. (ii) Perennials may incur a higher fitness cost of selfing through seed
discounting and inbreeding depression; hence, possibly
most selfers are annuals simply because relatively few perennials can be selfers [9,10].
A recent third hypothesis, the 'time-limitation' hypothesis, predicts that both selfing and the annual life cycle are
concurrent products of strong 'r-selection' associated with
high density-independent mortality risk in ephemeral
habitats with a severely limited period of time available to
complete the life cycle [11]. Both the traditional reproductive assurance hypothesis and the time-limitation hypothesis involve a fitness advantage for selfing through
ensuring that at least some reproduction occurs, but they
involve very different selection mechanisms – pollinator/
mate-limitation (where outcross pollen is not available at
all due to a lack of pollinators or mates), versus time-limitation (where outcross pollen is available but arrives too
late to allow sufficient time for development of viable
seeds). Accordingly, these two hypotheses for selfing
involve very different assumptions and predictions.
The time-limitation hypothesis has direct and indirect
components. The indirect component predicts higher selfing rates in annuals as a trade-off of selection for earlier
reproductive maturity in annuals [12,13] (Figure 1a).
More rapid floral maturation is expected to result in
smaller flowers with increased overlap of anther dehiscence and stigma receptivity in both space (reduced
herkogamy) and time (reduced dichogamy) thus, increasing the frequency of selfing as an incidental consequence
[12] (Figure 1a). If selfing also shortens the time between
flower maturation and ovule fertilization, then higher
selfing rates for annuals in time-limited habitats may also
be predicted as a direct fitness benefit; abbreviating the
time between anthesis and ovule fertilization may ensure
that there is enough remaining time in the growing season
(after ovule fertilization) to allow complete seed and fruit
maturation [11] (Fig 1b). Selection favors selfing here by
favoring increased overlap in anther dehiscence and
stigma receptivity in both space and time, which are in
turn facilitated by smaller flower size and shorter flower
development time, respectively (Figure 1b).
However, the two components of time-limitation cannot
be separated clearly, as they operate simultaneously; i.e.,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/5/2

earlier onset of flowering, shorter flower development
time, smaller flowers and selfing can all be interpreted to
have direct fitness benefits because they may all contribute directly to accelerating the life cycle [11]. Indeed, timelimitation associated with strong r-selection would be
expected also to favor an acceleration of the final stage in
the life cycle – seed/fruit development time (Figure 1) –
resulting, as a trade-off, in smaller seeds and/or fruits [11].
The time-limitation hypothesis remains untested. Some
recent studies have explored the rapid growth and maturation time of annuals in terms of bud development rates
and ontogeny [13-15]. However, these studies have compared growth and development rates between selfing and
outcrossing populations of only a single species. Since
their effective sample size is only one, this makes it difficult to extrapolate the predominant selection pressures
that may have promoted the general association of selfing
with the annual life cycle.
The objective of the present study was to compare, for
annuals exclusively, life history traits associated with selfing versus outcrossing using several species from a wide
range of plant families. Phylogenetically-independent
contrasts (PIC) were used to control for confounding
effects due to common ancestry among species [16].
Using a database of 118 species involving 14 families,
plant size, flower size, and seed size were compared
between selfing and outcrossing annuals. The time-limitation hypothesis predicts that all of these traits should be
smaller in selfing annuals because the severely time-limited growing season that promotes selfing also imposes an
upper limit on the maximum sizes that can be attained for
plant traits [11] (Figure 1). The trend for outcrossers to be
taller, and have larger flowers and larger seeds has often
been noted [1,17-19]. We used a multi-species, acrossfamily comparison, however, to investigate whether this
trend also holds true within annuals exclusively.
Data on the timing of life history stages (i.e. age at first
flower, bud development time, and flower longevity)
were also obtained from a greenhouse study of 25 annual
species involving 5 families. The time-limitation hypothesis predicts that selfers should produce mature flowers
more quickly and should have shorter flowering times.

Results
Data base analyses
Based on phylogenetically-independent contrasts, selfing
annuals had significantly shorter plant heights (Wilcoxon
test for matched pairs, n = 12, T = 15.5, one-tailed P =
0.032, Figure 2a), significantly smaller flowers (Wilcoxon
test for matched pairs, n = 14, T = 13, one-tailed P =
0.0054, Figure 2b), and significantly smaller seeds

Two components of the 'time-limitation' hypothesis for the evolution selfing in annuals
Two components of the 'time-limitation' hypothesis for the evolution selfing in annuals. In (a), selfing is a trade-off of selection
favoring a shorter time to reproductive maturity (fully developed flowers) under strong r-selection. As a tradeoff (dashed
arrows), flowers become smaller with greater overlap in location and timing of anther dehiscence and stigma receptivity, thus
increasing the rate of selfing as an incidental consequence. In (b) strong r-selection favors a shorter pollination time directly;
i.e., selfing is selected for directly because it shortens the amount of time between flower maturation and ovule fertilization,
thus leaving sufficient remaining time for seed and fruit maturation before the inevitable early mortality of the maternal plant
under strong r-selection. In this case, smaller flower size and shorter flower development time are favored by selection
because they facilitate selfing (see text).

(Wilcoxon test for matched pairs, n = 13, T = 13, onetailed P < 0.01, Figure 2c).
Greenhouse study
Bud development time (Figure 3) and flower longevity
(Figure 4) were significantly (P < 0.05) shorter in selfing
annuals in all of the families except the Fabaceae (P =
0.123 and P = 0.056 respectively). Selfing annuals also
had significantly shorter bud development times (Figure
5), and floral longevities (Figure 6) in three of the four
genus pairs. Selfing and outcrossing annuals of the genus

Ipomoea did not differ significantly in either bud development time (P = 0.402) or flower longevity (P = 0.328). Age
at first flower was not significantly related to mating system for any of the family or genus comparisons (P > 0.05;
data not shown).

Discussion
There is a rich body of theory and empirical work on the
evolution of selfing in flowering plants [e.g. [1,2,47,9,10]], but practically none of it involves an explicit role
of selection involving time-limitation. The present paper

is only the second to explore the implications of the timelimitation hypothesis and contribute to the maturation of
this idea. According to the time-limitation hypothesis,
selfing in annuals has evolved as a consequence of strong
r-selection in ephemeral habitats, resulting either as an
indirect consequence (trade-off) of selection for shorter
time to reproductive maturity (Figure 1a), or as a direct
consequence of selection for shorter pollination time, i.e.,
the time between flower maturation and ovule fertilization (Figure 1b), or both [11]. Consistent with the predictions of this hypothesis, we found, using
phylogenetically-independent contrasts, that (compared
with outcrossing annuals) selfing annuals in general had
significantly shorter plant heights, smaller flowers, shorter
bud development time, shorter flower longevity and
smaller seed sizes.

At the same time, these results are not inconsistent with
the predictions of selection resulting from pollinator/
mate-limitation associated with the traditional reproductive assurance hypothesis. Just as with many situations
where two different mechanisms can potentially produce
the same outcome/pattern, it is not easy here to clearly
distinguish between the roles of "pollinator/mate-limitation" and "time-limitation". Nevertheless there are two
important contributions from our study: First, in reporting significant life history differences between selfers and
outcrossers, our multi-species study is unique in its comparison of monocarpic annual species exclusively. All previous multi-species studies of trait comparisons between
selfers and outcrossers have involved variable mixes of
monocarpic and longer-lived polycarpic species. Second,
by comparing annuals exclusively, our results provide
indirect support for the time-limitation hypothesis, not by
rejecting the role of pollinator/mate-limitation, but rather
by representing a system in which it is more plausible to
argue for the role of time-limitation; i.e., compared with
pollinator/mate-limitation, time-limitation as a selection
factor favoring selfing is likely to have been much
stronger, more persistent and more widespread. The
strength of this argument lies in the fact that the annual
life history is unequivocally a product of some type of
time-limitation favoring an abbreviated life cycle, which is
promoted by (among other things) selfing (as opposed to
outcrossing) (Fig. 1). It is much less plausible to suspect
that selection associated with pollinator/mate-limitation
has been sufficiently strong and persistent to favor selfing
in such a wide range of annual taxa across the many genera and families considered here. We emphasize, therefore, that for annuals the time-limitation hypothesis
provides a more parsimonious explanation for the differences in traits between selfers and outcrossers. We consider each of these traits in turn below.

Plant height and time to anthesis
Taller plants may attract more pollinators and, hence,
experience greater outcrossing rates [20,21]. The pollination benefit of being relatively tall, therefore, is presumably experienced only by outcrossers. If, however, selfers
have evolved from outcrossers [3], then why should
selfers be shorter than their outcrossing ancestors? The relatively small size, including short height of selfers can be
predicted as an indirect consequence of selection, from
time-limitation, favoring precocious maturation time
[22,23] (Figure 1a). In the present study, however, selfers
and outcrossers did not differ significantly in age at first
flower. Andersson [18] found similar results between selfing and outcrossing populations of Crepis tectorum. Arroyo
[24], however, reported that selfing individuals of Limnanthes floccosa flowered earlier than the outcrossing L. alba,

as predicted by the time-limitation hypothesis. The results
for flowering times in the present study may be confounded by the controlled greenhouse environment of
constant day-length, temperature and moisture regime. In
the field, flowering times may be triggered by environmental cues. L. floccosa, for example, uses soil moisture to
trigger the early onset of flowering, thus escaping the detrimental effects of soil desiccation during seed development [24]. Note also that age at first flower is only a crude
estimate of time to reproductive maturity. Future studies
may employ more detailed measures such as rate of
mature flower production.
Flower size
One of the most well established trends of predominantly
self-fertilizing species is their reduced flower sizes

compared with outcrossing species [1,17]. The present
results indicate that this trend is also evident even within
annuals exclusively. In all but three of the 14 PICs, selfing
annuals had smaller flowers than the outcrossing annuals
(Figure 2b). Outcrossers and selfers had similar flower
sizes in the Fabaceae and Plantaginaceae. In the Poaceae,
outcrossing annuals had smaller flowers than selfers.
Under the time-limitation hypothesis, smaller flowers
and selfing may be tradeoffs of selection for precocity (Figure 1a), or smaller flowers may be favored by selection
because they promote selfing and hence, direct fitness
benefits by abbreviating pollination time (Figure 1b).
Also, if selfing evolves from outcrossing (by whatever
mechanism), then selection may subsequently favour a
reduction in flower size since relatively large flowers are

no longer needed to attract pollinators. Hence, higher fitness may result if the resources required to construct and
support these larger flowers are invested instead in other
functions (e.g. seed and fruit development) [17].
Bud development time
Selfers had significantly shorter bud development times in
all but one of the independent family contrasts (Figure 3)
and all but one of the genus comparisons (Figure 5).
Results from previous studies, however, are inconsistent.
Shorter bud development times were found in selfing
populations of Mimulus guttatus [25] and in Clarkia xantiana [14]. However, no significant differences in bud
growth rates were found between the selfing and outcrossing populations of C. tembloriensis [15]. Hill, Lord and
Shaw [13] reported that flowers from selfing populations

Page 8 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Ecology 2005, 5:2

of Arenaria uniflora develop over a longer period of time
than observed in outcrossing populations. In the field,
selfing populations of A. uniflora were also observed to
flower at the same time or even later than outcrossing
populations [13], suggesting that time-limitation is not
currently a strong selection pressure. Self-fertilization in
A. uniflora may have arisen through reproductive assurance in response to competition for pollinators [7]. The
evolution of self-fertilizing species from outcrossing progenitors has occurred repeatedly and independently in
several lineages [1,3,14], each of which may have been
associated with different contexts of natural selection visà-vis the fitness benefits of selfing.
Flower longevity
The families and genera in which selfers had shorter bud
development times also had significantly shorter flower
longevities (Figure 4). In fact, all of the selfers had flowers
that remained open for less than four days (except in Trifolium hirtum; Fabaceae), with a large proportion of flowers open for only one day, which is common amongst selffertilizing species [17]. The present data again indicate
that this generalization apparently holds true even within
annuals exclusively. By having flowers that remain open
longer, outcrossers increase the probability of visitation
by pollinators and successful cross-pollination [17]. This
fitness benefit is realized, however, only if there is sufficient time remaining after cross-pollination to complete
seed and fruit development before the maternal plant succumbs to density-independent mortality in strongly rselecting habitats [11]. If time is limiting in this context,
selection should favor selfing (Figure 1b) with no advantage in having long-lived flowers.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/5/2

because annuals are more likely than perennials to disperse further, or colonize new habitats where conditions
are unsuitable for successful outcrossing (because of a
shortage of mates or pollinators) and where selfing, therefore, provides reproductive assurance. The present study
indicates that even among annuals only, selfers have
smaller seeds than outcrossers (Figure 2c). Future studies
are required to test whether smaller-seeded selfing
annuals are more likely than their outcrossing annual relatives to disperse further or colonize new habitats and
thereby incur potential reproductive assurance benefits of
selfing.
An alternative explanation, however, is offered by an
extension of the time-limitation hypothesis: strong rselection favors an acceleration of all stages of the life
cycle (Figure 1), including not only earlier reproductive
maturity (Figure 1a) and a shorter pollination time (facilitated through selfing) (Figure 1b), but also a shorter seed
and fruit maturation time, which, on a per-seed basis, is
facilitated in turn through the production of smaller
seeds. Andersson [18] found that self-fertilizing individuals of Crepis tectorum took an average of 16 days for fruit
maturation, whereas outcrossing individuals of the same
species required 43.3 days. Small seed size may also be
simply a trade-off of selection for high fecundity, also
favored by strong r-selection [11].

It is important to note that our data measure maximum
flower longevity, since there were no pollinators in the
greenhouse, nor was hand pollination conducted. Pollination has been shown to induce floral senescence in
numerous species [26]. This effect was not tested on any
of the study species, which means that our observed
flower longevities in outcrossing species may be longer
than would normally be seen in the wild. Nevertheless,
since selfing may have evolved as a method of shortening
pollination time, and flower longevity was used as a measure of pollination time, the maximum floral longevity
gives an indication of how long outcrossers can delay
flower abscission or self-pollination (i.e. through delayed
selfing).

Habitat selection and time-limitation
While most selfers are annuals, it is not the case that most
annuals are selfers. An unbiased literature survey [27] suggests that roughly half of all annual species are selfers and
half are outcrossers. If, however, selfing annuals evolved
in habitats with a short window of time for completing
the life cycle (Figure 1), then selfing annuals should be
significantly more common than expected (i.e. comprising greater than 50% of resident annuals) within habitats
associated with historically regular, early-season disturbances (e.g. cultivated fields, gardens), or in habitats
where severe droughts follow quickly after a wet season
(i.e. deserts, Mediterranean climates, vernal pools).
Hence, we should expect to find more selfers than outcrossers among annual weeds of cultivated habitats and
among desert annuals in particular. Similarly, for annuals
with both selfing and outcrossing ecotypes or races, we
should expect selfers (or a higher selfing rate) to be more
commonly associated with these severely time-limited
habitats [11].

Seed size
Strong r-selection associated with the annual life form
presumably favors wide dispersal mechanisms (for colonizing new and distant sites) which may be conferred by
small seed sizes [19]. The reproductive assurance hypothesis would predict, therefore, that most selfers are annuals

While rigorous tests of these predictions have yet to be
explored, some preliminary support is available from
published surveys. From a representative sample of Mediterranean annuals [28], we find a much greater representation of selfers: i.e. 34 selfers versus 11 outcrossers.
Selfing and outcrossing desert annuals have been shown

to be distributed along a moisture gradient. Outcrossing
annuals are found generally in the wetter areas and selfers
in the more arid zones, as seen in Clarkia xantiana [29]
and between outcrossing populations of Limnanthes alba
and its selfing relative L. floccosa [24]. Since the length of
the growing season is limited by the amount of moisture
in the soil, selfers have a much narrower window of time
to complete their life cycle before desiccation. During a
severe drought, seed production in L. alba was reduced by
one sixth, whereas the seed set of L. floccosa found in the
same area was virtually unaffected by the identical
drought [24].
The association between 'weediness' and self-fertilization
has also been noted [2,30]. An extensive survey of colonizing herbaceous plants of Canada showed that agricultural weeds of row crops and grain fields are almost
exclusively annuals, and most of these are self-compatible
[31]. A published list of the world's worst weeds of agricultural crops [32] includes 76 species, 41 of which are
annuals. Based on previous literature, we were able to
identify the breeding system for 24 of these annuals, and,
as predicted, the majority (20 out of 24) are selfers.

Conclusions
Botanists have long known that selfing is particularly
associated with the annual life cycle in flowering plants
[2]. The present study shows further that, among annuals
exclusively, selfing is particularly associated with shorter
plant heights, smaller flowers, shorter bud development
time, shorter flower longevity and smaller seed sizes compared with annuals that are outcrossing. Also, in spite of
the null prediction that selfing and outcrossing annuals
should be equally represented if there is no bias associated
with time-limitation, we found instead that two of the
most time-limited habitats on earth that support flowering plants have a significantly higher percentage of selfers
among the resident species that are annuals. Because we
focused on annual species only, all of these results are
explained more parsimoniously by selection associated
with time-limitation than by selection associated with
pollinator/mate limitation. The role of pollinator/matelimitation (as traditionally associated with the reproductive assurance hypothesis for the evolution of selfing) is
likely to be of greater importance in longer-lived polycarpic species (not considered here), simply because by
comparison, there is no convincing basis to argue that
selection associated with time-limitation is likely to have
been important in species with longer life cycles. We suggest therefore, that most selfers, because most of them are
annuals, are likely to have evolved not because of fitness
benefits through reproductive assurance associated with
selection from pollinator/mate limitation, but rather
because of fitness benefits associated with selection from
time limitation.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/5/2

The effect of time-limitation under strong r-selection is to
minimize the duration of the life cycle, with selfing
favored directly (Figure 1b) and/or indirectly (Figure 1a).
There is no basis for predicting that either mechanism is
more probable than the other; both are likely to operate
simultaneously and perhaps indistinguishably. Indeed,
the predicted effects under direct and indirect selection
involve the same phenotypic outcome for the same suite
of traits (Figure 1). It is particularly significant that the
shorter bud development time reported here for selfing
annuals is predicted explicitly by the time-limitation
hypothesis but not by selection associated with pollinator/mate limitation. Although, we cannot of course rule
out the possibility that shorter bud development time
may be a pleiotropic consequence of the evolution of
autonomous selfing through other mechanisms.
Designing empirical studies that clearly distinguish
between mechanisms involving time-limitation versus
pollinator/mate limitation remain a challenge but we
anticipate that our results and our discussion of these
issues may help to inspire further research along these
lines. Future studies may be designed to test more directly
the role of limited pollination time (vis-à-vis Figure 1b) by
comparing the time required for effective pollination
under selfing versus outcrossing for closely related species
or ecotypes within natural habitats, taking care of course
to control for other aspects of the pollination environment (such as mate and pollinator availability) that might
affect time-to-effective pollination.

Methods
Data base analyses
The literature was surveyed to obtain breeding information (i.e. selfing versus outcrossing) for as many annuals
species as possible. For each species, data on plant height,
flower size, and seed size were obtained where possible
from standard floras and other published literature. A
complete database was assembled for 118 species from
both Europe and North America, involving 14 families
(Table 1). For each species, the maximum published value
for each trait was used. Plant height was the maximum
recorded vertical extent of the plant. The measure used for
flower size depended on the usual convention specific for
each family, e.g. maximum petal length, corolla width,
lemma length (in the Poaceae). Seed size was measured as
the length of the longest axis. Within each family, for each
trait, the median value across selfing species and the
median value across outcrossing species was calculated
and used in the phylogenetically-independent contrasts.

The contrasts were based on 14 phylogenetically-independent pairs, where each pair consisted of median values
of the selfing and outcrossing species within one family,
which by definition are species that are more closely

missing information. The data were analyzed using a Wilcoxon matched pairs test.
Greenhouse study
The species included in this study were chosen if there was
a known breeding system, if germinable seeds were available, and if a complementary species (i.e. in the same
family with the opposite breeding system) was known
and could also be obtained as germinable seeds. Seeds
were obtained from a variety of sources; Herbiseed, Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Gardens, Chiltern Seeds, S&S
Seeds, and the National Plant Germplasm System. Our
search lead to an unbiased sample of 25 candidate species,

allowing five pair-wise family comparisons and four pairwise genus comparisons (Table 2).
Most species were germinated in 15 cm pots filled to 3 cm
below the top with standard potting soil (Promix BX©).
Pots were placed in a greenhouse and watered daily until
the appearance of their first true leaves. Subsequently,
they were watered uniformly every second day to ensure
that the soil was kept moist. Some species were germinated in a petri-dish in a growth chamber (23°C, 12 hour
cycles of light and dark), after which they were transplanted into pots and placed in the greenhouse. Each species was replicated five times, with one plant per pot. Pots
were arranged randomly on benches at a density of 1 pot
per 0.093 m2.

The plants were exposed to 16 hours of daylight each day,
with maximal natural light levels at ca 1200 µE. Before
sunrise and after sunset, artificial lights (250–300 µE)
were used to supplement the light exposure to 16 hours of
light per day. The greenhouse was kept at an average temperature of 23.1°C during the day and dropped to 20.0°C
at night. The plants were fertilized every 2 weeks with 200
ml per pot of a 2g/L concentration of 20–20–20 N-P-K
fertilizer.
For each plant, age at first flower, bud development time,
and flower longevity were measured. Emergence of the
first pair of true leaves, after the cotyledons, was considered day 1 of the plant's life. Age at first flower was measured in days from day 1 to when the first flower opened
on each plant. Bud development time (n = 3 buds per
plant) was calculated as the number of days from the first
appearance of a new bud until the flower opened. The
same three buds on each plant were then monitored every
day after opening, and the number of days until the flower
senesced (flower longevity) was recorded for each. A
flower was considered to be senesced when the corolla
wilted, fell apart, or became discolored, as designated by
Primack [17]. Any flower that was open for only one day
was considered a one-day flower, regardless of whether it
was open for the whole day or only part. Flowers in the
Asteraceae were considered withered when the whole
inflorescence had senesced, rather than the individual florets [17].

For bud development time and flower longevity, the three
replicate measurements for each plant were averaged, and
then these values for the five replicate plants were averaged to obtain a mean value for the species. The data were
analyzed with a standard least squares one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) model, with a post-hoc contrast
between selfers and outcrossers. These analyses were done
for each family and genus separately in order to control
for phylogeny at these levels. In cases where the data were
non-normal, a log-transformation was applied which corrected the distribution.
