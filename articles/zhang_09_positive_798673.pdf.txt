Abstract
Background: New genes generated by retroposition are widespread in humans and other
mammalian species. Usually, this process copies a single parental gene and inserts it into a distant
genomic location. However, retroposition of two adjacent parental genes, i.e. co-retroposition, had
not been reported until the hominoid chimeric gene, PIPSL, was identified recently. It was shown
how two genes linked in tandem (phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, type I, alpha, PIP5K1A
and proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase, 4, PSMD4) could be co-retroposed from a single RNA
molecule to form this novel chimeric gene. However, understanding of the origination and
biological function of PIPSL requires determination of the coding potential of this gene as well as
the evolutionary forces acting on its hominoid copies.
Results: We tackled these problems by analyzing the evolutionary signature in both within-species
variation and between species divergence in the sequence and structure of the gene. We revealed
a significant evolutionary signature: the coding region has significantly lower sequence variation,
especially insertions and deletions, suggesting that the human copy may encode a protein.
Moreover, a survey across five different hominoid species revealed that all adaptive changes of
PSMD4-derived regions occurred on branches leading to human and chimp rather than other
hominoid lineages. Finally, computational analysis suggests testis-specific transcription of PIPSL is
regulated by tissue-dependent methylation rather than some transcriptional leakage.
Conclusion: Therefore, this set of analyses showed that PIPSL is an extraordinary co-retroposed
protein-coding gene that may participate in the male functions of humans and its close relatives.

Background
Retroposition, an RNA-intermediated copy mechanism,
could shape genomes widely in eukaryotes, and in particular plays a substantial role in evolution of functional
novelties [1]. People ever viewed it as a trivial molecular

process for making functionless processed pseudogenes
[2]. However, extensive analyses have revealed that a large
number of retrosequences have acquired various functions from vertebrates to invertebrates [3,4], from spermatogenesis [3] to courtship behaviors [5]. Many retrogenes

could recruit nearby preexisting exon-intron sequences
and genomic regions to form a chimeric gene structure
with novel protein structures, which may expand protein
functional diversity [6-8].
Almost all observed retroposition events involve a single
parental gene that serves as substrate for retroposition.
However, Akiva et al recently observed an extraordinary
case that two adjacent genes in the hominoid lineage,
PIP5K1A and PSMD4 in chromosome 1, co-retroposed
from a read-through transcript and formed a new chimeric gene, PIPSL, in chromosome 10 [9]. PIP5K1A
encodes the alpha isoform of phosphatidylinositol 4phosphate 5-kinase type I (PIP5K), which is involved in
the synthesis of two essential second messengers, 1,2-diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate [10,11]. On
the other hand, PSMD4 recruits ubiquitylated substrates
to the proteasome for their degradation, which is mediated by two conserved 20-30 residual hydrophobic
regions, i.e., ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) [12].
Northern analyses revealed high expression of PIPSL in
testis in humans and chimpanzee and base-level or undetectable expression in other tissues [13]. The human PIPSL
possesses a 1 bp in-frame deletion at +45 bp with respect
to the start codon, which is fixed in human populations.
Such a deletion causes an early frameshift with disrupted
translation such that western blotting does not reveal protein product in human. However, Western blotting also
fails to detect proteins in chimpanzee which does not
have such a deletion. Therefore, PIPSL was believed to
undergo translational silencing in both species [13]. Comparison of the substitution rates between synonymous
and nonsynonymous rates revealed that the C-terminal
portion of PIPSL derived from PSMD4 possibly undergoes
positive selection in the early stage of the hominoid clade
while the PIP5K1A-derived portion of the N-terminal portion in later stage of the hominoid clade does not depart
from neutral expectation [13]. The authors even propose
PIPSL might be detrimental in human population now.
These analyses provided valuable data to understand the
origination process and the characteristics of PIPSL. Moreover, this extraordinary gene raised two interesting questions for further pursuit. First, considering no protein
product is detected, is PIPSL a functional protein-coding
gene or it is a processed pseudogene that has never had or
has lost its function in human? Second, there were only
two species of hominoid species, i.e., human and chimp
in the analysis. Such limited dataset renders it hard to differentiate between the following two scenarios: positive
selection indeed occurred on evolutionary branches
toward human/chimp; positive selection occurs on
branches leading to other hominoids, e.g., orangutan and
gibbon and thus signal observed by comparing human

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/252

PIPSL and its two parental genes is a by-product. If the
later case is true, it will be reasonable to expect the
repressed translation in both human and chimp since
PIPSL might be only functional in orangutan and gibbon
rather than human and chimp.
We tackled these problems by analyzing the evolutionary
signature relating to the coding potential of PIPSL in both
within-species variation and between species divergence.
Such a strategy, complementary to the biological analyses
of Babushock et al. (2007) and Akiva et al. (2006),
revealed that the present-day PIPSL is subject to significant evolutionary constraint that shapes the standing variation in natural populations of the functional protein
coding gene in humans and maintains its open reading
frame (ORF). More than that, comparative analysis reveals
that the adaptive evolution occurred in the lineage toward
human and chimpanzee. Finally, genome-wide analysis
of retro-pseudogenes suggests testis-specific transcription
of PIPSL is not due to transcriptional leakage but highly
regulated by tissue-dependent methylation. These analyses, in conjunction of previous expression data at RNA
level, suggest that PIPSL is a functional retro-fusion testisspecific gene. Thus, the extraordinary co-retroposition
mechanism played a role in the evolution of the male-specific functions in the lineage toward the humans.

Results
The lower nucleotide polymorphism and high structural
integrity suggest PIPSL has coding potential
(1) CDS has a lower polymorphism level
The summary statistics for the population genetics of
PIPSL are shown in Table 1 and Figure 1 (see also Additional file 1). First, our polymorphism data suggests 5'
UTR and 3' UTR might undergo different selection force.
Table 1 shows the high constraint of 5' flanking region
with a nucleotide diversity (π) of 4 × 10-4, which might
correspond to a functional role. Consistently, the published Chip-chip experiment of the Ludwig institute [14]
shows this small region is highly enriched with transcription factor binding sites (see Additional file 2).

Moreover, as expected, CDS has fewer polymorphisms in
terms of π of 4 × 10-4 compared to the genome-wide background, 1 × 10-3[15]. It also has lower polymorphism
level in terms of SNPs and indels compared to 3' flanking
region. In terms of selection coefficient, θ, it is three fold
lower in that there are 11 SNPs across 875 bp 3' flanking
region, while there are only nine SNPs across 2,589 bp
CDS. We tested whether or not this difference departs
from neutral assumptions using Hudson's formula [16].
In this case, l, n and s are 2,589, 78 and 9, respectively. As
a result, the polymorphism level of CDS is significantly
lower compared to 3' UTR if the whole locus is homogeneously neutral (Table 2).

A. "Complete" indicates the full locus of PIPSL, which consists of 736 bp 5' flanking region, 1,482 bp PIP5K1A-derived CDS, 1,107 bp PSMD4-derived
CDS and 875 bp 3' flanking region. 5' flanking region includes both 592 bp promoter and 144 bp 5' UTR, while 3' flanking region indicates 3' UTR.
B. θ is the selection coefficient or 4Neμ (Ne and μ indicates the effective population size and mutation rate, respectively).
C. This unique indel is heterozygous.
D. Indel diversity is calculated using the most conservative way, i.e., we only count diallelic difference and regard the copy number variants in 3'
UTR as only two alleles. Thus, the indel diversity of 3' UTR might be underestimated.

However, can this result be accounted for by a difference
in local mutation bias, e.g., 3' UTR has a higher mutation
rate? If so, we expect that 3' UTR would have a higher
between-species divergence as well. However, we only
observed nine substitutions in 3' UTR compared to 31
substitutions in CDS (Table 3). By comparing polymorphism and divergence, HKA test shows CDS significantly
departs from 3' UTR (p = 0.03, Table 3) with possible
excess of substitutions in 3'UTR or the decrease of substitutions in CDS. In order to disentangle both possibilities,
we surveyed the polymorphism data of the PIPSL locus in
gibbon. According to the trace data, this locus seems pseudogenic, which could serve as a neutral background. Out
of two chromosomes from one female gibbon, nine segregating sites were identified, three derived from 3'UTR and
six derived from CDS. Given selection coefficient, θ, the
expected number of segregating sites, S, follows this formula [17]:
n

S =θ ×

∑1
i
i =1

where "n" is 78 and 2 for our case and the gibbon genome
sequence, respectively. In other words, if we increase the
sample size of gibbon sequences to 78, the expected
number of segregating sites in 3' UTR and CDS should be
about 10 and 20, respectively. It is notable this iterative
formula usually require multiple alleles like six or even
more. Therefore, the estimation of 10 or 20 might not be
that accurate. However, such a small sample does show
CDS might have more polymorphisms than that of 3' UTR
in gibbon PIPSL locus. Therefore, considering the
observed data in human, 11 substitutions in 3'UTR and 9
substitutions in CDS, the deviation of human polymor-

phism data from the neutral expectation should be more
likely attributed to the increasing constraint in CDS
region.
(2) Both polymorphism data and evolutionary simulation suggests
maintenance of PIPSL's ORF is not a by-chance event
The polymorphism data of Table 1 also show that CDS
appears to avoid indels compared to both flanking
regions. Specifically, there are five homozygous indels
and two heterozygous indels across 1.6 kb flanking
regions; by contrast, there is only one heterozygous indel
across 2,589 bp coding region (Fisher Exact Test p < 10-4).
Regarding indel diversity, it is an order-of-multitude larger
in UTR (6 × 10-4) than in CDS (1 × 10-5). Based on Hudson's formula [16], the probability to observe only one
indel in an CDS of 2,589 bp is only 0.001 if CDS has as
identical indel coefficient as that of UTR.

Using between-species data and by performing forwardsimulation from the ancient sequence of PIPSL in hominoid, we further tested how it might be possible to maintain one ORF of 2,589 bp. Specifically, taking advantage
of NCBI trace data, we assembled the complete PIPSL
locus in orangutan and gibbon given the high read coverage (>4x) around this locus. By contrast, we were only
able to assemble PIP5K1A-derived region in gorilla due to
its lower sequencing coverage in PSMD4-derived region.
Like human and chimp, orangutan maintains its PIPSL
ORF. However, the gibbon PIPSL lost its coding potential
by accumulating three nonsense substitutions and one inframe indel (See Additional file 3). Gorilla seems to lie in
a similar case with one nonsense substitution (CGA>TGA) in the middle of PIP5K1A-derived region.

We implemented ReEVOLVER [18] and forward simulated emergences of nonsense substitutions or frameshifting indels together with nonsynonymous mutations.
As a result, two tests of ReEVOLVER support the functionality of PIPSL (Table 4). Specifically, in the case of the
complete sequence, PIPSL demonstrates high constraint
revealed by both small Na/Ns (the ratio between number
of nonsynonymous substitutions and that of synonymous
substitutions) ratio (PNaNs~0.01) and frame-disrupting
features (stop codons or frame shifts) (Pdis < 10-5) compared to the expectation under neutrality. Furthermore, if
we analyze PSMD4-derived region and PIP5K1A-derived
region separately, both of them are also constrained as
shown by highly significant Pdis. As complementary evidence, we also investigated the process by estimating the
time necessary to disrupt PIPSL's ORF [19]. The time is
only 1.9 million years and thus the probability to maintain this ORF is 1 × 10-3 (See also Methods), which again
suggests its protein-level constraint.
Positive selection of PSMD4-derived region only leads to
human/Chimpanze lineage
The above analysis reveals that natural selection maintained a long ORF from the split of human and gibbon at
18 million years ago (Mya). Taking advantage of recently
available sequence data of gibbon, orangutan and gorilla,
we investigated this process with higher resolution. We
used CODEML of PAML package [20] to infer the background selection force (See also Method section).
(1) Heterogeneous selection in different species
PIPSL shows a remarkably heterogeneous evolutionary
pattern when comparing both the PIP5K1A-derived and
PSMD4-derived sequences, and when comparing different
species (Figure 2, Table 5). Specifically, the PIP5K1Aderived region did not show Ka/Ks significantly different
from 1 for any branch except there is an excess of synony-

mous mutations in orangutan (Likelihood Ratio Test, LRT
p = 0.02, Additional file 4). On the other hand, branchmodel of CODEML shows heterogeneity of Ka/Ks in the
PSMD4-derived region. A parameter-rich model with
internal branches and external branches that has two sets
of Ka/Ks fits the data better than a one Ka/Ks model (p =
0.026). Regarding individual species, the PSMD4-derived
region seems to show negative selection with Ka/Ks of
0.44 in orangutan although the test is not significant
(p~0.10). By contrast, it showed a strong signature of
adaptive evolution especially prior to the speciation of
human and chimp, where 7.1 nonsynonymous substitutions occurred without any synonymous substitutions (p
= 0.033). If we pool all three ancestral branches leading to
human/chimp together, the LRT is still significant with
Ka/Ks of 3.7 and p of 0.043, which suggests a long term
adaptation of PSMD4-derived regions in the ancestors of
human and chimp.
(2) Site-specific positive selection
Based on the branch-site model of CODEML, we inferred
PSMD4-derived region consists of seven nonsynonymous
mutations that occurred before the split of human and
chimp inferred. Four out of them happened around the
second ubiquitin-interaction motif (UIM-2) [21,22], R>H (amino-acid 262 in PSMD4-derived region), A->V
(278), Y->C (279) and Q->L (292) (see Additional file 5).
Moreover, strongly supports all these substitutions are
driven by adaptive evolution. All of them have a Bayes
Empirical Bayes (BEB) probability greater than 0.9, which
measures whether the Ka/Ks is larger than one for this
local region. Out of them, Y->C and Q->L even have a BEB
value larger than 0.95. These sites are also supported by
HyPhy (Additional file 5). The key residue Ala and Ser are
unchanged, which ensures that UIM-2 still maintains its
ubiquitin-interaction capability to some extent.

Table 4: 100,000 simulations are ran to track frame-disrupting features in case of CDS region derived from PSMD4, CDS region
derived from PIP5K1A and the complete CDS of PIPSL, respectively.

A. We used two distinct methods to reconstruct the ancestral sequence, PAML and Dnapars of Phylip package (Maximum-parsimony based
inference). In all cases, there results are similar between each other.
B. PNaNs is defined as the proportion of simulated datasets that show a Na/Ns ratio smaller or equal to the observation. Here, Na and Ns indicates
the number of nonsynonymous mutations and that of synonymous mutations, respetively.
C. Pdis corresponds to the percentage of simulated datasets that demonstrates a number of frame-disrupting mutations (stop codons and
frameshifts) smaller or equal to the observed number. Out of all lineages of interest, human, chimp, orangutan and gibbon, only three stop codons
and one indel are observed and those only in the gibbon genome. Specifically, two nonsense substitutions occur in the PIP5K1A-derived region,
while the other one nonsense substitution and one indel situate in the PSMD4-derived region.

N, A and C are short for "failure to reject Neutral null model", "Adaptive" and "Constrained", respectively. Selection force for PSMD4-derived
region of gorilla is still unknown given the lack of trace data.

By contrast, the parental protein PSMD4 is nearly
unchanged across 70~80 million years' mammalian evolution (Figure 2): there is only one nonsynonymous substitution between primate and dog. Inspection of all
available vertebrate lineage sequences shows that PSMD4
was always under strong purifying selection, except prior
to the split of birds and mammalian (see Additional file
6).
Testis-enriched transcription of PIPSL is tightly-regulated
by tissue-differential methylation
(1) Testing the hypothesis of permissive testis expression
Testis may provide a transciptionally permissive environment [22], which implies transcription leakage tends to
occur in testis more frequently than other tissues. From
this prospective, pseudogenes could be more likely
expressed in testis. Therefore, testis-specific transcription
is not necessarily a signature of functionality. In order to
test this possibility, we performed genome-wide profiling
of all retroposed pseudogenes in human. In brief, we integrated and improved upon previous strategies [4,8,23] to
identify retroposed copies (RPCs). Out of 6,750 RPCs, we
generated a highly reliable dataset of 729 retropseudogenes and a less stringent dataset of 5,386 retropseudogenes (see Additional file 7).

According to chromosomal coordinates and strands, we
cross-referenced this updated retropseudogene dataset
with the exon-array based expression data from UCSC
genome browser. Herein, UCSC presents the exon-array
data as log-ratios with positive values and negative values
indicating above-median expression and below-median
expression, respectively. We found human testis is not
permissive for retropseudogene transcription. As shown
in Table 6, no tissues show a remarkable difference in
expression of retropseudogenes. Testis expression of retropseudogenes is even slightly lower than many other tissues.
In addition, the exon-array data confirmed the abundant
expression of PIPSL in testis, consistent with previous

results from northern profiling experiments in testis, liver,
lung and many other tissues [13]. The abundance of PIPSL
amounted to 0.71 in testis as revealed by both independent probesets, while PIPSL abundance was lower than 0.2
for all other tissues, indicating trace level transcription.
For all 548 pseudogenes with exon array data, 38 (7%) are
transcribed in testis above the cutoff of 0.2. However, only
six out of them (1%) reaches as high abundance as 0.7 in
testis. Moreover, all of these six pseudogenes are also transcribed in some other tissues with the abundance above
0.2. Thus, abundant and specific transcription of PIPSL
establishes it as a clear outlier compared to retropseudogenes.
(2) Detecting methylation of PIPSL
If testis-specific transcription of PIPSL has functional significance, how is this tissue-specificity achieved? Weber
and his colleagues generated genome-wide methylation
data presented as methylation log2 ratios of bound over
input signals and they also proposed the value of 0.4 as a
cutoff to differentiate hypermethylation from hypomethylation [24]. As a result, they found germline-specific
genes preferentially undergo de novo methylation. Specifically, genes that are not methylated in sperm are more
likely to get methylated in somatic cells and transcriptionally repressed. Remarkably, PIPSL is consistent with this
pattern in that it is hypermethylated in primary lung
fibroblast cells with the log value of 0.6 and hypomethylated in sperm with the log value of -0.4.

For the aforementioned 729 retropseudogenes, only three
of them are covered by Weber et al's data and none of
them displays such a de novo methylation pattern. Notably, regarding the larger dataset of 5,386 pseudogenes, for
which 190 entries are included in Weber et al's set, only
ten (5%) show a strong de novo methylation in somatic
cells as PIPSL does. Considering this dataset might
include some functional retrogenes, the percentage of real
pseudogenes possessing de novo methylation might be
smaller than 5%. Again, this analysis suggests that PIPSL
is an intriguing outlier in that PIPSL's transcription profile

A. Expression value calculated is a log value, which might be smaller than 0 (See Methods). This column shows the median expression of all
pseudogenes in the tissue of interest.
B. This column counts the number of pseudogenes which has the highest expression in the tissue of interest no matter how much this highest
expression should be.
C. This column is similar to the previous column except the highest expression for a pseudogenes should be above the criterion of 0.2. This value
indicates a presence of expression by manually checking the correlation between EST data and exon-array data on UCSC genome browser.

is highly regulated rather than transcriptionally leaky.
That means testis-specific expression could be a functional
signature for PIPSL.

Discussion
Babushok et al. suggests that the indel around the original
start codon disrupts the coding potential of PIPSL locus in
human. However, our population genetics analysis shows
the downstream 2,589 bp ORF is more constrained than
the flanking regions in terms of frequency of SNP or
indels. Specially, lack of indels in CDS in the current
human population not only suggests PIPSL's coding
potential, but also indicates that human PIPSL is still
under purifying selection rather than relaxation, as proposed by Babushok et al. Secondly, our forward simulation shows it is highly unlikely that a neutral segment of
such a length would remain over 18 million years. As
shown by the PIPSL locus in gibbon, there are up to three
nonsense substitutions and one in-frame indel scatters
across the whole region. Thirdly, positive selection always
occurred in the internal branches leading to human and
chimp, which reveals continuing gain of function for a
long time rather than limited to the hominoid ancestor.
All these three lines of evidence suggest human PIPSL is a
bona-fide protein-coding gene. Protein translation might
be finely tuned and limited to specific time point, producing a small quantity of protein, as in a special stage of
spermatogenesis or during sperm-egg interaction. Thus,
PIPSL escapes detection of western blotting in whole testis
lysates.
The aforementioned comparative analysis also indicates
lineage specific evolution after origination of the PIPSL
locus. Different hominoid species might face different

environmental changes, which affect fitness of the same
gene, for example, PIPSL. An alternative interesting reason
might be the difference of the long term effective population size (Ne). All branches from the divergence of orangutan and human/chimp/gorilla groups have an
estimation of Ne which ranges from 10,000 to 100,000
(see Additional file 8) [25-28]. Organisms with a large Ne
are selectively efficient: those slightly advantageous alleles
would be more likely to be fixed and those slightly deleterious mutations would be more likely to be removed
[29,30]. By contrast, in organisms with a small Ne, slightly
beneficial mutations have high chance to get lost and
slightly deleterious mutations have high chance to get
fixed. From this point of view, PIPSL has a small fitness
advantage, which is more likely to get fixed or maintained
in orangutan or ancestral branches. In contrast, it might
be lost in gorilla with a smaller Ne. Herein, positive selection might occur before the split of gorilla and human/
chimp since they share the majority of their evolutionary
history. Thus, two independent losses of the open reading
frame occurred in both gorilla and gibbon. It is notable
such parallel loss is not that unlikely for new genes. For
example, an X-linked testes chimeric gene, Hun, was created about 2~3 million years ago, prior to the the split of
D. simulans, D. sechellia, and D. Mauritiana [31]. However,
Hun maintains a integral open reading frame only in D.
simulans, while its suffers from different frame-distrupting
mutations in both D. sechellia and D. Mauritiana.
As revealed by the lower number of SNPs and indels in
human, adaptive selection in the chimp/human ancestral
branch (with a much larger Ne) might increase the fitness
of PIPSL to an extent such that it could be maintained in
the current population under selective constraint.

Selection drives the remarkable change of UIM-2 on the
evolutionary branch leading to human and chimp. Considering UIM-2 while not UIM-1 is the preferred ubiquitin
binding partner, maintenance of the essential key residues
Ala and Ser in UIM-2 explains why PIPSL still can bind
ubiquitin, although its capability does decrease relative to
PSMD4 [13]. UIM-2 is also known to be responsible to
bind ubiquitin receptors [32]. The remarkable adaptive
changes in the ancestor of human and chimp might contribute to the change of interaction partner of PIPSL. Since
the parental gene PSMD4 undergoes strong purifying
selection during hundreds of millions of years of evolution, PIPSL could be an interesting target for further comparative functional study.
Finally, it is interesting to ask how many retroposed fused
genes the genome encodes considering the prevalence of
transcription-mediated gene fusion event [9]. We compared Ensembl gene annotation and retroposed copies we
identified, and found PIPSL is the unique case in the
human genome. Analogously, we do not find any case in
rhesus monkey, rat, dog, cow, opossum, platypus and
fruitfly. In mouse, we found another case that transcripts
of 6030436E02Rik and C330019G07Rik together with 1
kb intergenic region fused first and retroposed to Chromosome 8 (see Additional file 9). The fused locus has
been pseudogenized with seven frame shifts and four
nonsense mutations or six frame shifts and two nonsense
mutations scattered in the 6030436E02Rik-derived region
and C330019G07Rik-derived region, respectively. Its
non-functionality is also supported by the lack of transcription evidence like EST or mRNA. Extremely low
abundance of retroposed, fused genes across numerous
animals suggests the inefficiency or complexity of this
generation mechanism itself. First, as Akiva et al. [9]
shows, most transcription-mediated events are rare or
confined to certain tissues. In other words, they might not
be expressed in the germ line. Second, the mouse case suggests that the fusion might not be able to generate a continuous ORF with intervention of noncoding regions.
Akiva also shows only 25% cases can generate a fused
ORF. Finally, such locus might not get fixed in the genome
considering it interrupts the original dosage balance for
multiple genes. In addition to these issues, it is also not
clear how retroposed fused copies can insert into an
appropriate genomic context to become transciptionally
active.

Conclusion
Thus, PIPSL represents an extraordinary case in which natural selection has increased the genetic novelty via a complicated mechanism in primates.

Methods
Identification of retroposed copies are described in the
supplementary methods (see Additional file 7).
Related bioinformatic databases or resources
We used several annotation tracks of UCSC genome
browser like Chip-chip data of Ludwig institute [14] and
Human Exon 1.0 ST panel data of Affymetrix [33]. As for
the exon array data, UCSC processed the raw signal intensity with a quantile normalization method and generated
the summary signal using the PLIER algorithm [34]. After
that, these summary values were converted to log-ratios,
namely, negative values indicate below-median expression and positive value indicates above-median expression.
DNA sequencing and population genetics
In order to test functional constraint, we sequenced PIPSL
in 39 human individuals. DNA samples were purchased
from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, which
consists of 10 African Americans, nine Africans in the
south of the Sahara, 10 Russians and 10 Chinese. Such a
combination should be able to cover the majority of
human diversity. PIPSL locus including the coding
sequence (CDS) and 1 Kb flanking regions (mainly
untranslated regions, UTR) were PCR amplified based on
primers designed by Oligo http://www.oligo.net. If necessary, multiple PCR experiments were run to amplify the
full-length region. After that, PCR bands were sent to Invitrogen for sequencing. For each copy, six to eight walking
reactions were performed. Subsequently, we implemented a well-established pipeline including Phred,
Phrap [35] and Consed [36] to assemble PIPSL locus for
each individual.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and Insertion/
Deletions (indels) were identified with Polyphred [37]
and Polyscan [38]. Specifically, homozygous or heterozygous SNPs were called by Polyphred first. We retained
those highly reliable SNPs with Polyphred score of 99. For
SNPs with a score lower than 99, we retained them only if
they were identified by Polyscan too. As for indels, we
used Polyscan's results because Polyphred failed to identify any indel. After that, we manually checked Polyscan's
results and accepted those indels with high scores. Notably, we found Polyscan tends to assign homozygous
indels with much higher score by investigating the raw
sequencing data. Thus, our strategy tends to overlook heterozygous indels. However, it should not matter that
much because our population analysis mainly relies on
SNPs rather than indels and such a bias should exist for
both coding region and non-coding region.
Finally, we used DnaSP v4.50 [39] to generate the statistics of polymorphisms and perform Hudson, Kreitman

and Aguadé's (HKA) test [40] to detect whether both loci
follow the neutral null model. In brief, based on number
of segregating sites, Si and number of divergences, di, HKA
jointly estimates θi(selection coefficient), f(ratio of Ne for
both loci) and t (divergence time shared by both loci) by
fitting the expected values and variations of Si and di.
Finally, goodness-of-fit is tested with an approximate chisquare test.
We calculated the probability of the number of observed
segregation sites (SNP and indels) in CDS on a hypothetical θ (e.g. the one in 3' UTR) by following the recursive
equations [16]:

Pn ( s) =

We performed evolutionary simulation using ReEVOLVER v1.0 as its online document describes [18]. It
estimates the probability that an ORF is maintained for
millions of years of evolution. In simulation, we used the
species tree described in [18], the substitution rate of 1.0
× 10-9 per site per year and the indel rate of 1.0 × 10-10 per
site per year [18]. Given these parameters, ReEVOLVER
assumed Kimura-2-parameters model of sequence evolution and did forward simulations from the ancestral
sequence constructed by PAML [20] or DNApars [46]. In
this process, the so-called disable features, i.e., mutations
causing stop codons or frame shifts, are counted. We performed 100,000 simulations for the whole PIPSL locus,
PSMD4-derived region and PIP5K1A-derived region, separately.

while Pn(s) indicates the probability that s segregating sites
in a sample of n individuals.
Evolutionary analysis of PIPSL
We slightly modified Tracembler [41] to automatically
retrieve homologous reads from NCBI Trace-BLAST website using PIPSL sequence as the query, E-value 10-10 as the
cutoff, and gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon reads as the
database. Subsequently, all reads were submitted to UCSC
BLAT [42] server to check whether the best hit of each read
is PIPSL rather than its parental genes. We retained reads
meeting with the following two criteria: the top hit had to
match human PIPSL locus; the alignment identity of the
second top hit was smaller than that of the top hit. Finally,
we fed all the retained reads into the aforementioned
Phred, Phrap and Consed pipeline and assembled PIPSL
in gorilla, orangutan, and gibbon.

Baylor University College of Medicine Human Genome
Sequencing Center (BCM-HGSC) and Washington University Genome Sequencing Center (WUGSC) sequenced
two chromosomes of one wild-born gibbon female.
Given the high sequencing coverage for both chromosomes, we identified segregating sites using Polyphred
and Polyscan.
We constructed the multiple sequence alignment of PIPSL
and its parental genes using MUSCLE [43] and further
manually checked the alignment in GeneDoc [44]. Then
this protein based alignment was converted to the codonbased alignment with PAL2NAL [45].

ML-based analysis were implemented using CODEML of
PAML package v4.0b [20]. We used the free-ratio model to
estimate number of synonymous site and nonsynonymous sites and branch-model to estimate whether there is
a significant departure compared to the neutral expectation along one specific lineage. In order to infer which site
is under adaptive evolution in a specific lineage, we re-ran
CODEML with the branch-site model. Specifically, Yang
and Nielsen implemented two models, called A and B
[47], which permits variation of the ω ratio (i.e., Ka/Ks)
both among sites and among lineages. PAML 4.0b further
permits ω of the null model to vary between 0 and 1 rather
than the old model A which fixes the ω ratio to 0. There
are two tests associated with current model A. We used
Test 2 (fix_omega = 1; omega = 1), which is supposed to
be more robust to differentiate positive selection compared to a relaxation of functional constraint [48]. However, in order to increase confidence, we used
SubtreeSelection module of HyPhy [49] to do a similar
analysis. Across ReEVOLVER, PAML and HyPhy, we used
the species tree of primates described in [18].
As a complementary test, we also estimated the time
required to destroy PIPSL's ORF in one half of all simulations, t1/2 [19]. We followed the same substitution rate or
indel rate as [19] and found t1/2 is about 1.9 million years.
Thus, considering PIPSL predated diverge of human and
gibbon 18 million years ago, the possibility to maintain
this ORF is like 0.518/1.9 or 1 × 10-3.
