Characterization of a circulating PRRSV strain by
means of random PCR cloning and full genome
sequencing

Abstract
PRRS is a pig disease of major economic importance that causes respiratory and reproductive problems in pigs.
Over the last years it has become clear that PRRSV heterogeneity is increasing. Consequently, this has a potential
impact on diagnosis and strategies to counter this disease. The use of sequence-independent PCR techniques for
the detection and characterization of PRRSV could be useful to bypass problems associated with the heterogeneity
of this virus.
A random PCR cloning approach was tested for the characterization of PRRSV strain 07V063 of unknown genetic
background that circulated on a Belgian farm. By using this approach, 7305 bp of sequence data were obtained,
distributed randomly across the genome. Using RT-PCR with strain-specific primers, the full length sequence (15014
nt) was obtained. Phylogenetic relationships using ORF5 and ORF1a (NSP2) sequences showed that 07V063 was
classified in type 1 subtype 1 and that 07V063 was genetically different from prototype Lelystad Virus (LV). 07V063
showed 87-93% aa identity with LV ORFs coding for structural proteins. Most variation (compared to LV) was
noticed in Nsp2 (81% identity) with a deletion of 28 aa. This deletion was different from other known deletions in
this ORF. In conclusion, it is shown that this random PCR cloning approach can be used for the characterization of
new PRRSV strains of unknown genetic background.
Findings
Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS)
is an economically important viral pig disease in swine
producing countries worldwide. The virus can cause
reproductive disorders and can give rise to respiratory
problems in pigs of all ages [1]. Prevention of the disease is based on a combination of management and vaccination. Evidence is accumulating that PRRSV
heterogeneity is affecting the vaccination efficiency. It is
suggested that vaccines are only efficacious when the
vaccine virus and the challenge virus share a sufficiently
high homology [2-6]. PRRSV heterogeneity was originally considered mainly to occur between European (genotype 1) and American type (genotype 2) PRRSV, but
current understanding shows a more complex situation
with considerable genetic variability within genotypes
[7-9]. Since such variability may affect the efficacy of

vaccination programs and pose an obstacle for PRRSV
prevention and control, knowledge on the PRRSV
strains circulating on a farm may be essential for choosing an appropriate vaccine [10].
PRRSV diagnosis is mainly based on detection of
PRRSV antibodies, Reverse Transcriptase (RT) PCR or
virus isolation. Detection of antibodies by ELISA or
IPMA is not sufficient to establish the level of PRRSV
heterogeneity [11]. RT-PCR allows rapid detection and
genotyping of PRRSV, but the high degree of sequence
variation observed for PRRSV can influence results
obtained by (real-time) RT-PCR and primers and/or
probes should be carefully designed based on conserved
regions [8,12]. The development of sequence-independent PCR techniques could be useful for the diagnosis
and genotyping of unknown PRRSV isolates and for
assessment of the PRRSV heterogeneity of field isolates.
Several methods have been developed for the identification of viruses without prior sequence knowledge [13].
For instance, whole genome amplification and random
PCR are relatively simple. In both these methods, viral

particles (from biological samples or cell culture) are
treated with DNAse and RNAse to remove contaminating nucleic acids. RNA and/or DNA from the viral particles is extracted and RNA is reverse transcribed to
cDNA using a primer with a random 3’end. Subsequently, cDNA or viral DNA is amplified using a shorter
primer (without the 3’ random end). This results in
DNA fragments of varying size (e.g. 0.5 - 2 Kb) and
these fragments can be cloned and sequenced. For
instance Allander et al. [14] used random PCR on
human respiratory tract samples which allowed identification of several unknown viruses.
The aim of this study was to test a random PCR cloning technique [14] for the detection and genotyping of a
PRRSV strain of unknown genetic background.

PRRSV 07V063 was isolated from an aborted foetus from
a Belgian farm, by inoculation of porcine alveolar macrophages. On this farm, vaccination with Porcilis™ was in
place. PRRS diagnosis was confirmed upon detection of
cytopathic effect (CPE), and detection of PRRSV antigens
by IPMA staining with the nucleocapsid specific mAb
P3/27 [15]. The use of a random PCR approach abrogates
the need for a priori sequence information and in combination with small scale shotgun sequencing, this can
result in viral sequences. Virus 07V063 was grown on
MARC-145 cells and concentrated as described [16] and
the viral pellet was treated with DNAseI and RNAse.
RNA was extracted using commercial kits and used in
reverse transcription and random amplification using the
tagged random hexanucleotide 5’-GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATCNNNNNN-3’ for both first- and second
strand cDNA synthesis and subsequent amplification of
the cDNA with primer 5’-GCCGGAGCTCTGCAGATATC-3’ [14]. Random PCR fragments ranging between
500 and 1200 bp were cloned in pCR-Blunt II-TOPO
(Invitrogen). Twenty nine clones were sequenced as
described [17]. Twenty three clones (80% of the clones)
contained PRRS sequences (Table 1). The six other
clones showed no match when performing BlastN http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. The 07V063 sequences were randomly distributed across the PRRSV genome. Several
clones were overlapping and six contigs (with sizes
between 622 and 2072 bp) were obtained (Figure 1).
Thus, without prior knowledge of the sequence it was
possible to obtain 7305 bp sequence data using a random
PCR cloning approach, hereby confirming PRRS identity.

obtained using primers that were based on the 07V063
sequences from the random PCR cloning approach
(Table 2). Overlapping amplicons (spanning the complete genome) were obtained using RT-PCR. Both
strands of these fragments were directly sequenced. For
the amplification of the 3’end, oligodT was used in combination with ORF7fw. A 5’ end primer (5’endfw) was
designed based on the alignment of genotype 1 strains
LV (M96262), EuroPRRS (AY366525), SD01-08
(DQ489311), KNU-07 (FJ349261) and HKEU16
(EU076704). This primer was used in combination with
primer Lavgsprev to amplify the 5’end. A full length
sequence of 15014 nt was obtained. This sequence was
deposited in Genbank (Accession GU737264).
The 5’ end and 3’end of 07V063 was 221 nt and 114
nt, respectively. The size of the 5’end of 07V063 is identical with the 5’end of LV with 92.3% identity and 17 nt

(81% identity/85% similarity). A major difference is a
deletion of 28 aa in a variable region of Nsp2 (at positions 683-710). Similar deletions in this region are
known e.g. EuroPRRS has a 17 aa deletion (Figure 2A;
[18]). The deletion in NSP2 in 07V63 could be a unique
marker for this strain.

epitope is present in LV at positions 57-68 [19] and that
this region is under antibody-mediated pressure in vitro
and in vivo [20,21]. Pigs infected with 07V063 produce
neutralizing antibodies against the 57RVTAAQGRIYTR68
epitope. However, these antibodies do not cross-protect
against LV [22]. Similarly, antibodies against the same
region in LV, do not cross-protect against 07V063.
Interestingly, this lack of cross-neutralization is in agreement with the finding that strain 07V063 was able to
replicate and cause disease on a farm where animals
were vaccinated with the LV-like Porcilis™ vaccine.
GP5 has been described as the main target for virusneutralizing antibodies in North American PRRSV
strains. A neutralizing epitope has been identified at
positions 37-45 [23]. Figure 2C shows that 07V063 and
LV have an identical sequence from 37-45 with the
exception of an extra glycosylation site at position 37 in
07V063. It has been shown that several strains are glycosylated at this position but the significance of this glycosylation is not known. Other amino acid changes
occur throughout the sequence and several of these
positions have been described as variable [24]. No other
differences in glycosylation pattern of the structural proteins between 07V063 and LV was observed.

Table 4 Overview of strains used for phylogenetic
analysis

Phylogenetic relationship of 07V063

Since ORF5 is frequently used as a marker for the study
of genetic relationships [8], we constructed phylogenetic
trees using ORF5 sequences from a selection of genotype 1 strains (Table 4). In addition genotype 1 strains
for which the full length sequence was available in Genbank were included. VR-2332 (genotype 2) was used as
out-group.
Figure 3A shows a phylogenetic tree of ORF5 DNA
sequences based on the Neighbour Joining (NJ) method.
Several clusters are evident and supported by high bootstrap values. It can be concluded that 07V063 clusters
within the pan-European subtype 1 [8]. Within subtype
1, a cluster with LV- and Olot/91-like strains can be distinguished. Although both LV and Olot/91 belong to the
earliest PRRSV isolates, still LV and Olot/91-like strains
such as SD01-08 are circulating. Strain 07V063 is
genetically different from LV- and Olot/91- like strains.
Apparently 07V063 clusters together with isolates from
different geographical locations e.g. isolates from Spain
(16/2000), Denmark (361-4), China (BJEU06-1) and
South-Korea (IV3140) although this clustering is not
supported by high bootstrap values. A similar tree topology was obtained using ORF5 protein sequences (data
not shown). The sub-clustering of type 1 is complex and
cannot always be explained by geographic isolation of
the strains [8]. The sequence of 07V63 adds to the
increase of genetic diversity of type 1 strains and is an
example of continuous genetic drift within PRRSV [24].

The type of the strains is according to Stadejek et al (2008). ND = no data. VR2332 is genotype 2. Eleven genotype 1 isolates for which full length
sequences were obtained are listed first.

A recent PRRSV study in Spain [25] demonstrated that
Spanish isolates from different years show continuous
evolution and increase in heterogeneity and that different genotypes and variants within the genotypes cocirculate.

Figure 3 Phylogenetic relationship of 07V063. Phylogenetic trees were derived from multiple sequence alignments using Phylip v3.67.
Bootstrapping was performed 500 times using SEQBOOT. Pairwise distances between DNA and/or protein sequences were determined with
DNAdist and PROTdist, respectively. Neighbour-Joining (NJ) trees were calculated with NEIGHBOUR and Maximum Likelyhood (ML) trees with
DNAML and PROML. Majority rule consensus trees were calculated using CONSENSE. The percentage confidence is indicated on the branches
(500 datasets). Trees, constructed using NJ method, based on ORF5 DNA (A) or ORF1a (Nsp2) DNA (B) sequences. Strain 07V063 is underlined.
VR-2332 was used as outgroup.

Also, phylogenetic trees using Nsp2 were constructed
(Figure 3B). Sequences from all known full length genotype 1 strains (Table 4) were included. Essentially, the
same topology can be observed as for ORF5. A cluster
of LV-like strains is evident and supported by high
bootstrap values. As was already observed from the
ORF5 phylogenetic tree, Amervac and SHE are very closely related as is the case for strains 01-CB1 and LV.
07V063 clusters apart from LV and is genetically distinct from the LV prototype.

Conclusions
By using a simple random PCR cloning approach we
obtained PRRSV sequence data from a recent European
PRRSV isolate of unknown genetic background. This
approach can be used to obtain partial genome
sequences from for instance East-European type strains

(for which until present, no full length genomes are
available) and to get a better knowledge of the increasing PRRSV variability. We also showed that the isolate
sequenced in this study is genetically different from prototype LV.
