Abstract
Background: Balancing selection operating for long evolutionary periods at a locus is
characterized by the maintenance of distinct alleles because of a heterozygote or rare-allele
advantage. The loci under balancing selection are distinguished by their unusually high
polymorphism levels. In this report, we provide statistical and comparative genetic evidence
suggesting that the SDHA gene is under long-term balancing selection. SDHA encodes the major
catalytical subunit (flavoprotein, Fp) of the succinate dehydrogenase enzyme complex (SDH;
mitochondrial complex II). The inhibition of Fp by homozygous SDHA mutations or by 3nitropropionic acid poisoning causes central nervous system pathologies. In contrast, heterozygous
mutations in SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD, the other SDH subunit genes, cause hereditary
paraganglioma (PGL) tumors, which show constitutive activation of pathways induced by oxygen
deprivation (hypoxia).
Results: We sequenced the four SDH subunit genes (10.8 kb) in 24 African American and 24
European American samples. We also sequenced the SDHA gene (2.8 kb) in 18 chimpanzees.
Increased nucleotide diversity distinguished the human SDHA gene from its chimpanzee ortholog
and from the PGL genes. Sequence analysis uncovered two common SDHA missense variants and
refuted the previous suggestions that these variants originate from different genetic loci. Two highly
dissimilar SDHA haplotype clusters were present in intermediate frequencies in both racial groups.
The SDHA variation pattern showed statistically significant deviations from neutrality by the Tajima,
Fu and Li, Hudson-Kreitman-Aguadé, and Depaulis haplotype number tests. Empirically, the
elevated values of the nucleotide diversity (% π = 0.231) and the Tajima statistics (D = 1.954) in the
SDHA gene were comparable with the most outstanding cases for balancing selection in the African
American population.
Conclusion: The SDHA gene has a strong signature of balancing selection. The SDHA variants that
have increased in frequency during human evolution might, by influencing the regulation of cellular
oxygen homeostasis, confer protection against certain environmental toxins or pathogens that are
prevalent in Africa.

Background
Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH; mitochondrial complex
II) is an essential enzyme complex that has dual roles in
the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain (ETC) in
mitochondria [1]. SDH is composed of four subunits
encoded by the nuclear genes SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, and
SDHD. SDHA at chromosome band 5p15 and SDHB at
chromosome band 1p35 encode the two catalytical
hydrophilic subunits flavoprotein (Fp; 70 kDa) and ironsulfur (Ip; 35 kDa), respectively. SDHC at chromosome
band 1q23 and SDHD at chromosome 11q23 encode the
two membrane-spanning hydrophobic subunits, cybL (15
kDa) and cybS (12 kDa), respectively. The SDHA, SDHB,
SDHC, and SDHD gene products are encoded by 15, 8, 6,
and 4 exons, which span genomic distances of ~38 kb, 35
kb, 50 kb. and 10 kb, respectively [2,3].
The identification of the SDHD subunit gene as the hereditary paraganglioma type 1 locus (PGL1) has uncovered
unexpected links between SDH and tumor susceptibility,
and highlighted the role of mitochondria in cancer [4].
Since then, mutations in SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD subunit genes (PGL genes) have been established as an important cause of sporadic and familial paragangliomas [5-10].
The paraganglia specificity of PGL tumors [4] and data
from global gene-expression analysis [11], cell biology
[12], animal-model studies [13], and gene-environment
interaction and population genetics [14] support the
hypothesis that constitutive hypoxic stimulation underlies the pathogenesis of PGL.
The role of SDH in disease pathogenesis has been implicated independently through a series of studies on a
widely distributed plant and fungal neurotoxin, 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NPA)[15]. Acute food poisoning with
3-NPA, which can lead to central nervous system defects
with lifelong disability and to mortality in ~10% of the
cases, have been associated with consumption of moldy
sugarcanes in China [16]. The neurodegeneration induced
by 3-NPA poisoning often involves the basal ganglia, hippocampus, spinal tracts, and peripheral nerves, and the
symptoms mimic those of Huntington's disease [17]. 3NPA irreversibly inhibits SDH, owing to the similarity of
the chemical structures of 3-NPA to succinate [18]. It has
been suggested that 3-NPA may form a covalent adduct
with an arginine residue at amino acid position 345 in the
active site of the Fp subunit [19].
Surprisingly, mutations in the major catalytical subunit
SDHA have yet to be associated with PGL. Although
homozygous mutations in SDHA have been found in
Leigh syndrome [20], a severe neurodegenerative disorder
of childhood, and with neuromusculopathies, no genetic
link between SDHA and paraganglioma susceptibility has
ever been established. Current biochemical knowledge on

SDH provides very few clues for the phenotypic dichotomy arising from the germline subunit gene mutations.
SDHA and SDHB subunits encode the two physicallyinteracting catalytical subunits, so it is surprising that their
mutations would have such different phenotypic consequences [21]. Recently, after identifying cDNA sequences
encoding a missense Fp variant containing the Y629F and
V657I polymorphisms, Tomitsuka et al [22,23] proposed
that distinct genetic loci encode two Fp variants, namely
type I and type II. They reached this conclusion after
observing tissue-specific and cell line-specific differential
expression of the cDNA variants and PCR amplification
from genomic DNA of processed SDHA gene fragments
that lacked introns (i.e, a functional SDHA retrogene).
However, the genomic location of the retrogene that was
proposed to encode the second SDHA gene could not be
determined. A retrogene for SDHA is not present in the
human genome, according to the March 2006 assembly in
The UCSC database. [24] Finally, Briere et al [25] showed
the presence of the missense SDHA variants in several different cell types and assumed that these variants originate
from two different genes, although they provided no
experimental or bioinformatic evidence for the genomic
presence of a second SDHA locus. Briere et al [25] suggested that the presence of two SDHA genes in paraganglia
prevents tumorigenesis. If Fp were encoded by two different loci, this would indeed have provided a simple explanation for why SDHA mutations would not be associated
with PGL susceptibility.
An alternative approach to gain insights into gene function involves analysis of sequence variation in the population. To date, no study has systematically addressed the
variation patterns in the SDH subunit genes in normal
subjects from different racial or ethnic groups. To gain further insights into the multiple roles of SDH in disease predisposition and to help to integrate the seemingly
disparate phenotypic consequences of SDH subunit
defects, we examined sequence variation in the complete
coding and partial flanking intronic sequences of the four
SDH subunit genes in 24 samples from an African American population and 24 samples from a white population.
These analyses uncovered an unexpected degree of nucleotide diversity in the SDHA gene.

Results
Sequence variants in the SDH subunit genes
Using PCR, each coding exon and the flanking introns of
the four SDH subunit genes in 24 European American and
24 African American samples were amplified, and were
then sequenced. In total, 3828 coding and 7013 non-coding nucleotides were sequenced for each sample, and 52
polymorphisms were detected (Table 1). The heterozygous frequencies of all variants were consistent with
Hardy-Weinberg expectations (p > 0.01) in both sets of

zee samples. We obtained high-quality sequences for
exons 3–6, 8, 12, 13, and 15, which together comprise a
total genomic sequence size of 2832 bp (Table 1). We
identified one silent exonic and seven intronic fixednucleotide differences between the human and chimpanzee SDHA genes (Additional file 2), corresponding to a
substitution rate of 0.28%. The nucleotide substitution
rate in SDHA is lower than the average of 127 known
genes (0.75%) that were recently sequenced in human
and chimpanzee [29]. The chimpanzee SDHA gene has 10
polymorphic variants, compared with 21 in the human
gene in the same region, and showed ~2.9-fold lower
nucleotide diversity (π) than the human gene (Table 3).
Furthermore, θs and π estimates of nucleotide diversities
were similar in the chimpanzee, consistent with neutral
expectations. These findings indicate that the mutation
rate in SDHA is not inherently high and that the increased
nucleotide diversity in the human gene must have
occurred after the split of the two species from their common ancestor 5–6 million years ago.

samples. Except for two non-coding indels in SDHA and
one in SDHC, all variants were single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involving base replacements. A full list of
the identified sequence variants is provided in Additional
File 1 and has also been submitted to the SDH mutation
database [26]. SDHA variant density was 2.6-fold and 2.3fold higher in the coding and non-coding regions, respectively, than the average of 106 genes [27]. The minor allele
frequencies of all variants are shown in Figure 1.
Nucleotide diversity in SDH subunit genes
We calculated the nucleotide diversity in SDH subunit
genes using the population genetic parameters π and θs
(Table 2). As expected, all diversity indices were higher in
the African American samples. The nucleotide diversity
(%) in the total sample set was low at the PGL genes:
SDHB (π = 0.008), SDHC (π = 0.065), and SDHD (π =
0.044). In contrast, the nucleotide diversity of the SDHA
gene (π = 0.199%) was 5.1-fold higher than the average of
the PGL genes and 3.4-fold higher than the average (π =
0.058%) of 292 autosomal genes [28]. The θs and π estimates of nucleotide diversities were similar for the membrane-spanning subunits SDHC and SDHD, but differed
substantially for the two catalytic subunits. Whereas the π
estimate was ~1.6-fold higher than θs for the SDHA gene,
consistent with the enrichment of alleles with intermediate frequencies, the θs estimate was ~4-fold higher for the
SDHB gene, indicating the very low frequency of the
allelic variants. For comparison, 90% of the genes in a
recent survey had θs estimates higher than the π estimates
[28], indicating an abundance of rare alleles, which is
thought to be a result of recent population expansion in
humans. FST statistics provided statistically significant evidence of population differentiation between the two
racial groups for the SDHA, SDHC, and SDHD genes, but
not for the SDHB gene (Table 2). This was attributable to
the very low frequencies and the absence of SDHB allelic
variants in the African American and European American
samples, respectively.

Tests of neutrality
We employed three commonly used tests (the Tajima D
tests and the Fu and Li D* and F* tests) to identify departures of the allelic distributions from neutral expectations.
None of the PGL genes showed statistically significant
departures from neutrality in samples from either racial
group (Table 4). In contrast, the allelic distribution of the
SDHA gene showed positive test values at statistically significant levels in both racial samples (Table 5). Notably,
the neutrality statistics were supportive of balancing selection on SDHA despite the presence of six singleton variants in the African American samples and one singleton
variant in the European American samples (Additional
file 1). To obtain a clearer picture of the departure of
SDHA allelic distributions from neutral expectations, we
analyzed non-coding, coding, synonymous, and non-synonymous variants separately (Table 5). Nominally significant departures from neutrality were obtained in seven of
the nine test statistics for the non-coding variants,
although the SDHA coding region variation was also suggestive of an excess of variants in intermediate frequencies
in the African American samples.

Comparison of the human and chimpanzee SDHA genes
for sequence diversity
To test whether high nucleotide diversity also characterizes the chimpanzee SDHA gene, we used the human PCR
primers to amplify and sequence 18 unrelated chimpanTable 1: Summary of variants in SDH subunit genes

To test whether the level of silent diversity in SDHA correlates with level of divergence between human and chimpanzee, as predicted by the neutral theory, we used the
Hudson-Kreitman-Aguadé (HKA) test. Sequence data
from four loci that were assumed to be evolving neutrally
were used for comparison. These loci include non-coding
regions on chromosome bands 1q24 [30], 22q11 [31],
and Xq13.3 [32] and the promoter region of β-globin at
11p15 [33]. Locus-by-locus comparison provided statistical significance in two of the four tests, suggesting
increased diversity in SDHA relative to these two loci
(Additional file 3). To further address whether the SDHA
variation pattern is unusual when information from the
comparison loci is jointly used, we used a recently developed maximum-likelihood-ratio test [34]. The likelihood
of two models were compared; the first assumes that all
five loci evolve neutrally, whereas the other assumes that
SDHA is subject to selection while the other four loci

evolve neutrally. The model assuming selection on SDHA
was statistically supported over the model of neutrality (p
= 5.3 × 10-3; Table 6). These results further support the
hypothesis that increased nucleotide diversity in SDHA is
maintained by balancing selection.
Empirical assessment of neutrality in SDH subunit genes
Because population history plays an important role in
shaping the variation patterns in the genome, we sought
to assess whether the nucleotide diversity of complex II
genes were unusual compared with other genes across the
genome. We used the summary statistics for Tajima's D
test and nucleotide diversity of 282 genes listed in the
SeattleSNP database for comparison. When compared
with the database genes, the statistics for nucleotide diversity and Tajima's D were not outstanding for any of the
complex II genes in the European American samples or for
the SDHC and SDHD genes in the African American sam-

ples. However, the SDHA nucleotide diversity was higher
than that of 279 (p < 0.015) of the genes and the Tajima
D statistic was higher than that of 281 (p < 0.0036) of the
genes in the African American samples (Figure 2). In contrast, SDHB had less sequence diversity than 280 of the
SeattleSNP genes (p < 0.011) in the African American samples. A recent analysis of 151 loci in the SeattleSNP set has
indicated that the D statistic of the ABO locus (D = 1.58)
retains its significance in an African American population
under several demographic scenarios [35]. Because the
magnitude of D in SDHA in our African American samples (D = 1.95) is higher than that in the ABO locus (Figure 2), it is likely that the statistical support for balancing
selection on SDHA would be retained by different population histories. In summary, the departure of SDHA
allelic distribution from neutral expectations is empirically supported in the African American samples, consistent with a balancing selection mechanism.
Haplotype structures of the SDH subunit genes
Haplotypes, haplotype-block structures and the tagging
SNPs for each block were inferred using the web-based

HAP software (see methods). As expected, the haplotypes
were more variable in the African American than in the
European American samples. The SDHA haplotype variation could be defined by 6 haplotype blocks and 13 tagging SNPs in the African American samples but only by 3
haplotype-blocks and 5 tagging SNPs in the European
American samples (Additional file 1). In contrast, haplotype variation in the PGL genes could be defined by single-haplotype blocks. The most common haplotype
accounted for ~99% of the haplotypes of the PGL genes in
the European American samples (Additional file 4). Similarly, the most common haplotype and its 1-nucleotide
neighbors covered ~98%, 79% and 73% of the variation
in the SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD genes, respectively, in the
African American samples.
The commonness of a single haplotype and its 1-nucleotide neighbors in the PGL genes was in stark contrast to
the presence of two common but highly dissimilar haplotypes in SDHA in both racial groups. The two most common SDHA haplotypes, A1 and A2, accounted for ~19%
(17/90) and ~9% (8/90) of all haplotype diversity, respec-

tively, and differed from each other in 22 of the 36 variant
positions (Figure 3). Haplotype A1 and A2 encode the
missense Fp variants Y629-V657 and F629-657, by the
SNPs 27 and 35, respectively, indicating an allelic association of the missense variants in these two amino-acid
sites. Notably, the variant Fp amino acids Y629 and V657
were conserved in mammalian Fp sequences, including
orangutan, macaque, mouse, dog, rat, and bovine. However, different amino acids were found in phylogenetically
more distant species such as the zebrafish, which had
Y629-I657 and Dirofilaria, an infectious nematode, which
had E629-I657.
All of the remaining 34 SDHA haplotypes were highly
similar to one of the two commonest haplotypes, and
formed two distinct haplotype sets, referred to as haplogroup 1 and haplogroup 2. The haplotypes within each
group differed from the most common haplotype of the
group in up to seven variant positions, with a median
number of three differences. The frequencies of haplogroups 1 and 2 were ~56% and ~44% in the African American samples and ~82% and ~18% in the European
American samples, respectively. A median-joining network of all haplotypes clustered all but one haplotype
within two distinct haplogroup clusters (Figure 4). The
only haplotype (RR) that mapped outside of the two haplogroups clusters was probably a recombination product
between haplogroup 1 and haplogroup 2.
Haplotype number test
To test whether the number of predicted SDHA haplotypes in the African American samples is compatible with
neutral evolution, we employed the Depaulis and Veuille
haplotype number test [36]. In total, 35 variants in 46
African American sequences defined 27 different haplotypes (Figure 3). Using Depaulis and Veuille simulations
under assumptions of neutrality showed that when there

are 40 variants in 50 sequences, the upper limit of the
95% confidence interval for the expected number of different haplotypes is 24. Thus, the number of SDHA haplotypes is statistically significantly higher than expected
under neutrality, and is consistent with an ancient balanced polymorphism in the African American population.
Estimating age of the SDHA haplogroups
We estimated the age of the two haplogroups by comparing the sequence divergence between them with that
between the human and chimpanzee genes, assuming a
constant evolutionary rate of nucleotide substitutions.
Haplogroups 1 and 2 have eight fixed nucleotide differences, at SNPs 8–12, 17, 21, and 22 (Figure 3), within
5255 bp, whereas human and chimpanzee genes have
eight fixed nucleotide differences within 2832 bps. On the
basis of these fixed nucleotide substitutions, we estimated
haplogroups 1 and 2 to be as old as [(8/5255)/(8/2832)]
times the divergence time of human and chimpanzees.
Thus, SDHA balanced polymorphisms were estimated to
be 2.69–3.23 million years old, assuming a divergence
time of 5–6 million years for human and chimpanzees.
This is probably a conservative estimate, as the fixed differences between the haplogroups erode in time by
recombination and gene conversion.

Discussion
Our results establish a foundation to understand the
selective and demographic forces that have shaped the
variation patterns in SDH subunit genes, and have important functional implications. Our findings indicate that
the variation pattern in SDHA is characterized by the presence of higher sequence diversity, two common and
highly dissimilar haplogroups, and statistical and empirical support for the operation of a balancing selection
mechanism. Our data also refute the previous suggestions

*Number of unrelated subjects.
†Number of segregating sites. DnaSp software excludes from the analyses the insertion/deletion variants, two of which were detected in the noncoding SDHA sequence. Inclusion of the SDHA indels, by recoding them as SNPs, increased all SDHA test statistics and reduced the p values (data
not shown)

that the Y629F and V657I variants originate from two distinct genetic loci because these missense variants are
encoded by a single, highly polymorphic SDHA gene.
The PGL genes had much lower nucleotide diversity,
which was especially evident in SDHB, suggesting that the
SDHB gene product might be under functional constraints that preclude the accumulation of variants. If
slightly deleterious variants in PGL genes increase the risk
of paraganglioma tumor development, such variants
would be eliminated before they reach high frequencies in
the population. This potential mechanism might apply
especially to SDHB because its mutations are associated
with malignancy and early-onset pheochromocytomas
that could lead to severe hypertensive crises [37,38]. In
contrast, because there is no evidence that heterozygous
mutations in SDHA are associated with a pathologic phenotype, negative selection of deleterious SDHA alleles
may operate only when they are in the homozygous state,
which often leads to a lethal metabolic syndrome in childhood.

A major finding of our study is the unexpectedly high
nucleotide diversity in the SDHA gene in the African
American samples. It has been suggested that high local
recombination rates may increase SNP density [39]. However, this mechanism is unlikely to contribute to SDHA
variant density, because a recent high-resolution recombination map indicates a very low recombination rate at the
tip of chromosome 5 short arm, where SDHA is located
[40]. It is conceivable that the four SDHA pseudogenes,
generated by complete or partial gene duplications, may
increase the de novo mutation rate in the SDHA gene
through illegitimate recombination or gene conversion
during meiosis to increase variant density. However, lack
of high nucleotide diversity in the chimpanzee SDHA
gene does not suggest that the mutation rate in SDHA is
inherently high, even though the chimpanzee genome
also contains the duplicated SDHA pseudogenes. Rather,
our findings suggest that the high nucleotide diversity of
the human SDHA gene is a consequence of persistence of
two distinct haplogroups for long periods during human
evolution, leading to acquisition of a distinct set of polymorphisms by each haplogroup.

Tajima's D statistic and nucleotide diversity in SDHA and SDHB genes (squares) relative to the 282 genes in
SeattleSNP database are shown in the African American population. Positions of two highly polymorphic loci, ABO
and FUT2, the latter of which encodes the alpha(1,2)fucosyltransferase, are shown.

The most important finding of our study is the statistical
and empirical support for a balancing selection mechanism on SDHA. A classic example of balancing selection is
found at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
loci [41], where high levels of polymorphisms in the functional MHC genes may confer a selective advantage to the
heterozygotes by enabling them to process a wider range
of pathogen antigens on T cells. The variation in a few
other human genes may also have been shaped by balancing selection. For example, the 5' cis-regulatory region of
CCR5, encoding the principal coreceptor for HIV-1 [42],
protocadherin alpha gene cluster promoters [43] and the
bitter-taste receptor gene, PTC [44], have two major
ancient haplotype groups and positive D test statistics,
similar to SDHA. However, in contrast to SDHA, these
genes did not show significant Tajima D statistics in the
African or African American samples. In general, the average Tajima D value is positive in the European American

population and negative in the African American population. Positive Tajima D statistics in European Americans
are often interpreted to reflect population contraction that
occurred during the migration of modern humans out of
Africa, whereas negative Tajima D statistics in African
Americans may reflect admixture between African and
European populations [35]. Thus, evidence of balancing
selection on a gene, suggested by statistically significantly
positive Tajima D values, is more likely to be confounded
by population history in European American samples
than in African American samples.
It is conceivable that an environmental factor prevalent in
Africa may have contributed to the increased frequency of
certain SDHA variants that might have differential roles in
the regulation of oxygen homeostasis by the SDH complex. A candidate environmental factor is the neurotoxin
3-NPA and its aliphatic nitrocompounds derivatives. In

addition to being a product of certain fungi such as
Arthrinium species, 3-NPA and its derivatives are also
found in several higher plants. The toxicity of these plants
is well established, because their aliphatic nitrocompound contents have been linked to acute and chronic
diseases in some domestic animals. Major livestock losses
were attributed to plant nitrocompounds in the western
United States, Canada and Mexico [45]. Thus, although
human toxicity involving moldy sugarcane poisoning
have to date been reported only in China, human exposure to 3-NPA and other nitrocompounds might be more
common throughout the world than is indicated by the
numbe of clinical cases [18,46]. 3-NPA exposure might be
more prevalent in Africa partly because a hot and humid
climate promotes the growth of fungi. If certain SDHA
variants confer a selective advantage against 3-NPA poisoning by affecting gene expression levels, protein translation efficiency, and/or the binding affinity for 3-NPA,

then such variants may provide a survival advantage for
their carriers against 3-NPA poisoning. Alternatively, SDH
may play a currently unrecognized role against infectious
pathogens such as malaria, which are prevalent in Africa.
Genetic studies of PGL suggest that inactivation of SDH by
subunit mutations inappropriately activates hypoxiainducible pathways. If the SDHA variants that have
increased in frequency during human evolution are hypomorphs or encode Fps that have slight functional deficits,
these variants might promote the activation of hypoxiainducible pathways and help the immune cells to survive
better under sustained hypoxic microenvironments of the
infected tissues.
Finally, our findings do not support the previous explanations as to why SDHA mutations are not associated with
PGL susceptibility because these explanations assume the
presence of two SDHA genes in the human genome.

Instead, the contrasting patterns of sequence variation
between SDHA and the PGL genes suggest the presence of
two functionally distinct modules in SDH: one formed by
the three closely-associated PGL gene products (PGL module), and the other a loosely-interacting, highly-variable
SDHA protein product. This model provides an alternative explanation as to why SDHA mutations do not cause
PGL and predicts the following two conditions:
(i) The relative concentration of SDHA protein product is
much higher (>two-fold) than the PGL module in the paraganglionic tissues. Thus, even a 50% reduction in SDHA
protein levels, as a result of heterozygous mutations,
would not compromise the SDH function in paraganglia
to initiate tumor formation.
(ii) The physical interaction between the SDHA protein
product and the PGL module is loose and kinetically fast
during catalysis, thus a mutant SDHA protein product
could not irreversibly trap a PGL module to initiate tumor
formation.

Conclusion
Our findings demonstrate that the SDHA gene carries a
strong signature of balancing selection in the African
American population and that PGL and SDHA gene products are subject to distinct selective constraints. Collectively, these data provide new insights into SDH biology
and may catalyze further research on the causes and the
consequences of the unexpectedly high sequence diversity
in the SDHA subunit gene.

Methods
Samples
DNA was isolated using standard protocols from samples
from 24 unrelated African American and 24 unrelated
European American women, which are part of an anonymized sample collection in the Department of Human
Genetics at The University of Pittsburgh School of Public
Health. The samples were collected under research protocols approved by the internal review board review committee. One African American and two European
American samples that failed to amplify multiple SDHA
exons on repeated attempts were removed from certain
analyses, including minor allele frequency calculations,
haplotype analysis, and neutrality statistics. We also
sequenced the SDHA gene in 18 unrelated common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), which are part of the primate
DNA collection in the Department of Human Genetics.
PCR and sequencing
PCR amplification for each exon was performed by using
oligonucleotide primers that were designed from the
flanking intronic or untranslated sequences of the exons.
The primer sequences and the amplicon sizes for each

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/12

SDH subunit gene exon are provided in Additional file 5.
The PCR amplification was performed using Taq polymerase under standard conditions. The PCR amplification of
SDHA is potentially confounded by the presence of multiple pseudogenes created by genomic duplications. These
pseudogenes contain multiple mutations in their coding
regions. BLAST analyses of human expressed sequences
database in GenBank reveal no evidence for expression of
the SDHA pseudogenes (data not shown). The PCR primers for specific amplification of the SDHA gene were
designed so that the 3' ends of the primers were placed at
nucleotides that showed divergence from the pseudogenes. The human genome March 2006 sequence assembly at UCSC database indicates that SDHA has two
complete and one truncated gene duplications within ~3
Mb at chromosome band 3q29 and one truncated duplication ~100 kb centromeric to the functional gene at chromosome band 5p15 [24]. The duplicated SDHA copies
have 92.5–98.4% sequence identity with the functional
gene within the exons and in the flanking introns. This
high degree of sequence identity has erroneously led to
the designation of some of the fixed nucleotide differences between the functional SDHA gene and its pseudogenes as real SNPs in the SDHA gene in the dbSNP
database. In our experiments, we confirmed the specific
amplification of each SDHA exon by analyzing the nucleotide positions of the amplicons where there are fixed differences between the functional and the duplicated gene
copies (number of fixed nucleotide differences between
SDHA and its duplicated pseudogenes are indicated in
Additional file 5). In addition, we confirmed that all
SDHA exonic variants, except the rare variants of SNPs 15,
33, and 36, which were observed only once in our whole
sample set (i.e. were singletons), are represented by multiple expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in the human EST
database at NCBI as determined by BLAST analyses [47].
Taken together, these results confirm that our genomic
primers have specifically amplified the exons of the functional SDHA gene while avoiding the duplicated pseudogenes.
Computational analyses
The sequenced segments of the genes, including the coding, non-coding and flanking intronic sequences, were
conjoined in a single gene-sequence file. This file was then
used to enter polymorphism data for each sample using
Sequencher™ software (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann
Arbor, MI, USA). The sequence files for each sample were
used to generate input files for data analyses in population genetic software. Nucleotide diversity, population
diversification analyses and departures from Hardy-Weinberg expectations were calculated using Arlequin software
(version 2.001) [48]. Tests of neutrality were conducted
using DnaSp software (version 4.10) [49]. The phylogenic
relationship between the inferred haplotypes was estab-

lished using Network software (version 4.1) [50]. All software programs were operated on a PC platform.
Haplotype analyses and the prediction of tagging SNPs
were performed using HAP, a free web-based haplotype
analysis software.
Sequence databases
We used the BLAT function of UCSC genome browser to
determine the genomic locations of and sequence similarities between SDHA genomic duplications [24]. The
Ensembl genome browser was used to determine the
intron-exon junction, transcription initiation sites, and
start/stop codons of the SDH subunit genes [51]. Gene
variation data in the SeattleSNP database (August 2006)
derived from 24 African American individuals and 23
Europeans [52] were used to compare with our results.
Population genetics
Nucleotide diversity
Two measures of nucleotide diversity were derived using
unphased genotypic data: π, which measures the mean
number of differences per nucleotide between two randomly chosen sequences and θs, which measures the proportion of segregating sites under the assumption of an
infinite site-neutral model. Both measures estimate the
mutation rate, θs = 4Neμ, where Ne is the effective population size and μ is the neutral mutation rate per generation.

In a sample of n chromosomes, π = Σi<j πi, j/nc, where πi, j
is the number of nucleotide differences between ith and
jth DNA sequences and nc = n(n - 1)/2 and
θs = S/a, where a =

n −1

∑ 1/i

ative excess (positive D values) or deficiency (negative D
values) of substitutions of various frequencies [54].
Departures from the neutral model of the allelic distributions can also be tested by Fu and Li's D* and F* test statistics [55]. These tests compare the number of mutations
between internal and external branches of a sequence
genealogy with their expectations under selective neutrality. D* and F* tests compare the number of nucleotide
variants observed only once in a sample with the total
number of nucleotide variants and with the mean pairwise difference between the sequences, respectively. We
assessed the significance of neutrality test statistics by
comparing the observed test values to those obtained by
10000 coalescent simulations using sample size and
number of segregating sites as variables and assuming a
standard neutral model with no recombination. Coalescent simulations were performed by DnaSp software (version 4.10).
We used the HKA test for excesses of variation in SDHA
gene. This test compares whether the level of intra-specific
polymorphism parallels the level of nucleotide divergence
between two species in a given locus relative to neutrally
evolving loci. We used the direct HKA mode in the DNAsp
software for locus-by-locus comparison. We also used a
software testing maximum likelihood ratio of selection on
SDHA in a multilocus framework as described previously
[34]. Twice the difference of log likelihoods for two competing models is approximately χ2 distributed, with the
degree of freedom (d.f.) equal to the number of selected
loci. We seeded 100000 and 200000 cycles of the Markov
chain to run two independent tests on a PC. Both chains
provided similar results.

i =1

Tests of neutrality
θs is strongly affected by the existence of deleterious alleles, because such alleles are usually present in low frequencies, but θs is not affected by the frequency of
mutants. Conversely, π is not significantly affected by the
presence of rare deleterious alleles because π incorporates
the frequency of mutants. If some of the variants in the
sample have selective effects, then the estimates of θs and
π will be different. Tajima [53] used the difference
between these two estimates to detect selection among the
sequences.

Tajima's D statistic is calculated as D = (π - θs)/[Var(π θs]1/2
The value of D is expected to be zero for selectively neutral
variants in a constant population. A non-zero D value is a
sign of departure from the neutral model caused by a rel-

Genetic structure of populations
The genetic structure of populations was investigated by
the analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) approach, as
implemented in Arlequin software [48]. This approach is
based on the analyses of variance of gene frequencies. The
proportion of total variation among populations is estimated by FST, Wright's fixation index.
Haplotype analyses
We used HAP, a software employing a highly accurate
method for common haplotype prediction from genotype
data [56] to calculate minor allele frequencies of all variants. The haplotype resolution employs a phasing method
that uses imperfect phylogeny. This method partitions the
SNPs into haplotype blocks, and for each block, it predicts
the common haplotypes and each individual's haplotype.
We used Network (version 4.1), a phylogenetic network
analysis software, to generate an evolutionary tree network that links the predicted haplotypes on the basis of
their similarity [50].
