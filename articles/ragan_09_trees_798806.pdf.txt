Abstract
It is well-known that Charles Darwin sketched abstract trees of relationship in his 1837 notebook,
and depicted a tree in the Origin of Species (1859). Here I attempt to place Darwin's trees in
historical context. By the mid-Eighteenth century the Great Chain of Being was increasingly seen
to be an inadequate description of order in nature, and by about 1780 it had been largely abandoned
without a satisfactory alternative having been agreed upon. In 1750 Donati described aquatic and
terrestrial organisms as forming a network, and a few years later Buffon depicted a network of
genealogical relationships among breeds of dogs. In 1764 Bonnet asked whether the Chain might
actually branch at certain points, and in 1766 Pallas proposed that the gradations among organisms
resemble a tree with a compound trunk, perhaps not unlike the tree of animal life later depicted
by Eichwald. Other trees were presented by Augier in 1801 and by Lamarck in 1809 and 1815, the
latter two assuming a transmutation of species over time. Elaborate networks of affinities among
plants and among animals were depicted in the late Eighteenth and very early Nineteenth centuries.
In the two decades immediately prior to 1837, so-called affinities and/or analogies among organisms
were represented by diverse geometric figures. Series of plant and animal fossils in successive
geological strata were represented as trees in a popular textbook from 1840, while in 1858 Bronn
presented a system of animals, as evidenced by the fossil record, in a form of a tree. Darwin's 1859
tree and its subsequent elaborations by Haeckel came to be accepted in many but not all areas of
biological sciences, while network diagrams were used in others. Beginning in the early 1960s trees
were inferred from protein and nucleic acid sequences, but networks were re-introduced in the
mid-1990s to represent lateral genetic transfer, increasingly regarded as a fundamental mode of
evolution at least for bacteria and archaea. In historical context, then, the Network of Life preceded
the Tree of Life and might again supersede it.

Prefatory quotation

The rise and fall of the Great Chain of Being

(N)ature rises up by connections, little by little and without
leaps, as though it proceeds by an unbroken web, it proceeds in
a leisurely and placid uninterrupted course. There is no gap, no
break, no dispersion of forms: they have, in turn, been connected, ring within ring. That very golden chain is universal in
its embrace. - Juan Eusebio Nieremberg, 1635 [[1], p.29]

From very early in the Middle Eastern and European religious and intellectual traditions, chains, cords, ladders
and stairways served as metaphors for order in the world,
or between earth and heaven [2-6]. The image of a tree
sometimes served in the same metaphorical sense [[5],
pp.319-329; [6], p.22]. A linear order in nature was comPage 1 of 38

patible, for example, with the hierarchical arrangement of
creation implied by emanationist cosmology, correspondences between spiritual and earthly bodies, and the literal
or figurative ascent of the soul or mind toward God. Even
the incipient change, beginning in the Twelfth century,
from a God-centric to a man-centric hierarchy provided
no cause to question the underlying assumption of a linear arrangement or ordering in nature.
Within this Great Chain of Being, organised matter on
earth might constitute a greater or lesser portion. In the
Physicorum elementorum of Charles de Bouelles [7], for
example, earth, water, air and fire constituted only four of
the 25 hierarchical levels that culminate in the Deity (Figure 1). By contrast, the Liber de ascensu et descensu intellectus of Ramon Llull [8] presents an eight-step stairway of
which stones, fire, plants, brute animals and man form
the first five steps, and the Deity is reached at step eight
(Figure 2). In principle, not only large inclusive groups
(animals, plants) but indeed every taxon of being, no matter how minor, might be ordered linearly, in accord with
Aristotle's famous description of organized matter as
...proceeding little by little from things lifeless to animal life in
such a way that it is impossible to determine the exact line of
demarcation, nor on which side thereof an intermediate form
should lie. Thus, next after lifeless things in the upward scale
comes the plant, and of plants one will differ from another as
to its amount of apparent vitality; and, in a word, the whole
genus of plants, whilst it is devoid of life as compared with an
animal, is endowed with life as compared with other corporeal
entities. Indeed, as we have just remarked, there is observed in
plants a continuous scale of ascent toward the animal [[9],
588b:4).
Beginning in the Sixteenth century, botanical and zoological treatises were sometimes arranged to present organisms as forming a more-or-less ascending (or descending)
series [10-13]. A particularly fine-grained linear arrangement appeared in the 1788 Flore Françoise by Jean-Baptiste
Lamarck [14], although Peter Stevens hints that this
arrangement per se may be due more to the Abbé René-Just
de Haüy than to Lamarck himself [[15], 79f145]. But
already by that point in the late Eighteenth century, the
Great Chain was widely seen as inadequate in describing
biological diversity. This crisis was brought about by four
related developments, which I briefly present in turn.
First (chronologically) was Richard Bradley's argument
that degree of perfection must not be argued from mere
Platonic form or essence, but arrived at instead by analysis
of "figure or parts" [[16], p.18]. His wonderful Philosophical Account of the Works of Nature (1721) arranges minerals, plants and animals in an ascending, if idiosyncratic,
scale of nature, with innumerable descriptions, compari-

sons and analogies relating to their exterior body parts,
internal circulation of fluids, features of reproduction,
rates of growth and development, metamorphosis, activity, strength, "spirit" [[16], p.89] and "uses". Bradley was
comfortable with the idea of perfection (e.g. of body parts),
but observed multiple, non-uniform progressions, with
individual species being imperfect in some regards and
more-perfect in others. Indeed in respect of the linear
arrangement of animals, Bradley famously concluded:
"I suppose it may be wonder'd at, that hitherto I have not mentioned Mankind, who is so remarkable a Creature, and Lord of
all the rest; I confess, was I to have placed him where the Parts
of his Body would most agree with those of the created Bodies
mention'd in this Treatise, I must have set him in the middle of
this Chapter; but I suppose my Reader will excuse me, if I shew
him so much regard, that I rather speak of him in the summing
up of my Scale, than let him be encompass'd with wild Beasts."
[[16], p.117]
Second, the vast expansion in knowledge of animal, plant
and microbial diversity in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth
centuries [17-22] did not yield a more-continuous Chain;
critics from Voltaire [[23], pp.58-60] to Dr Johnson [24]
(and later, Eldridge & Gould [25]) could point to innumerable discontinuities, not to mention the fundamental
paradox of continuity among discrete entities. Churchmen and philosophers had long grappled with the concept of plenitude (complete realisation of possibility)
given the obvious imperfection of the world [4], with
Peter Lombard arguing that we cannot deny to God the
fullest scope of action in creation, i.e. he could have created a more-complete, more-perfect universe had he so
willed [26]. But had the voyages of discovery been set up
as an experimental test of morphological continuity
across nature, the null hypothesis (discontinuity) would
not have been rejected.
Third, and far more seriously, certain high-profile discoveries could not be fit into any reasonable linear arrangement of nature. Debate raged through the first half of the
Eighteenth century (and beyond) on whether coral polyps
were animal, vegetable, mineral, or some combination
thereof [16,27-30]. Placing the green Hydra [31] among
the mosses, for instance, would remove it far from the selfmotile worms or insects. Likewise it seemed impossible to
decide whether "the little Proteus" Volvox [[32], III
pp.621-624] should be placed at the base of the plant
scale, or at the base of the animals. In his beautifully written Contemplation de la Nature (1764-65), sometimes considered the culmination of the case for a Great Chain of
Being, Charles Bonnet felt compelled to ask whether
insects and shellfish need to be assigned to "lateral and
parallel branches off this great Trunk" [[33], III p.xx].

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/43

Finally, it was becoming increasingly apparent that the
continuity, if any, between plants and animals did not
join the most-perfect plants (for Bonnet, "sensitive"
plants such as Mimosa) with the least-perfect animals such
as jellyfish. According to Linnaeus in aphorism 153 of
Philosophia botanica:
Nature herself associates and joins Minerals and Plants and
Animals; but in so doing it does not connect the most perfect
Plants with Animals that are said to be the most imperfect, but
imperfect Animals and imperfect Plants are combined.... [[34],
§153]
I consider it unlikely that Linnaeus intended to argue that
the combining (combinat) of imperfect animals and
imperfect plants was more-integral than the associating
and joining (sociat et conjugit) of minerals, plants and animals, and not only because sociat is equally well translated
unites. Others later did draw this distinction: Flittner [35],
for example, claimed that zoophytes, corals, sponges and
seaweeds shared both plant and animal natures; and dual
or alternating identities were frequently invoked e.g. in
descriptions of coral polyps, alternating life-history stages
of algae, and unicellular organisms such as diatoms
[36,37]. In aphorism 153 Linnaeus probably did, however, intend to contrast "imperfect" with "maximally
imperfect": nature joined the former.
Of course, linking the most-simple plants with the mostsimple animals would yield not a linear scale or chain, but
rather a dichotomy, as in the letter V; and if plants and
animals were contiguous at multiple points (not only the
maximally imperfect), order in nature would more resemble the letter Y. The Great Chain was in deep crisis.

The search for alternative descriptions of nature
Although at first Linnaeus accepted that nature is ordered
in a linear scale [38], by 1750 or 1751 he realized that
even the plants could not be arranged in a simple unitary
continuum. This casts an interesting light on aphorism 77
of his Philosophia Botanica [[34], §77], the three wellknown parts of which might not, on initial reading, seem
to be closely related:
The fragments of the natural method are to be diligently sought
out. This is the first and last desideratum in botanical study.
Nature does not make leaps. All plants show affinities on either
side, like territories in a geographical map.
In the first two sentences, Linnaeus acknowledges that his
own system of nature corresponds to the natural method
only in small disjoint parts (fragments). Nature is, however, without gaps (Linnaeus takes this quotation verbatim from Ray [39]) and among the plants one family can
be contiguous to one, two, or more than two others -

Page 4 of 38

Biology Direct 2009, 4:43

unlike in a chain, where each family must have exactly
two neighbors (even the least-perfect plants would be
joined below to the minerals, as the most-perfect plants
would be joined above to the animals). His map analogy
seems not to have been taken literally at first, as no Map
of Plants appears to have been rendered until Paul Giseke
did so in 1792, fourteen years after Linnaeus's death [40];
but thereafter the cartographic enterprise persisted until
1859 and beyond, with Alphonse de Candolle developing
rules for distributing plant taxa on a two-dimensional
"map" [41]. Sachs [[42], p.137], Stevens [43], O'Hara [44]
and Ragan [37] mention other early maps of nature.
The concept affinity bears further comment. In the late
Eighteenth and very early Nineteenth centuries, affinities
were regularities of resemblance or arrangement among
characteristic or functionally important body parts (e.g.
those constituting skeletal or organ systems) that indicated an attraction or closeness between the organisms or
taxa in which they were found. Some authorities, observing the investigations of Lavoisier on describing the "affinities" that determine how chemical substances attract each
other and form compounds of fixed stoichiometry, sought
or imagined corresponding affinities in the biological
realm that could likewise reveal the true order in nature,
or natural laws [[45], pp.38-39 and chapter 8;[46], I
pp.535-540]. These affinities could be "morphological,
structural, and physiological" [[47], IV p.81]. Later, affinity came to be reserved for taxa, whereas the corresponding relation among characters would be called homology
[[44], p.258]. Innate affinity was properly contrasted with
analogy, which was external, superficial or remote.

Trees before Darwin
Keys are hierarchical arrangements intended to aid identification or information retrieval, and are sometimes presented as a branching logical structure, i.e. a tree. An early
key of plant genera, by Zaluziansky à Zaluzian (1592), is
shown in Figure 3 [[12], opp. p.87], and keys were relatively commonplace by the second quarter of the Eighteenth century (e.g. Ray, van Royen, Linnaeus).
Much more interestingly, nearly a century before Darwin's
Origin of Species, Peter Simon Pallas proposed in Elenchus
Zoophytorum [48] that the gradation among organisms
might best be described as a branching tree:
"...various authors desire a certain pleasing scale in nature, of
such excellence as will never be found, such as Bradley and
Bonnet wish for. The gradation can be expressed no less well,
indeed very much better, as various affinities in polyhedric figures, [with] genera of organic bodies distributed close by in
numerous small spaces by turns. As Donati has already judiciously observed, the works of Nature are not connected in series
in a Scale, but cohere in a Net. On the other hand, the whole

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/43

system of organic bodies may be well represented by the likeness
of a tree that immediately from the root divides both the simplest plants and animals, [but they remain] variously contiguous as they advance up the trunk, Animals and Vegetables;
those leading, from Mollusca advancing to Pisces, with great
lateral branches of Insects sent out among themselves, from
here to Amphibia; and at the extreme top of the tree the Quadrupeds are supported, Aves truly thrust out as an equally great
lateral branch below the Quadrupeds. At the same time this
image shows the animals to be neither continuous nor neighboring, but standing like a lone tree. Its trunk is the series of the
more principal neighboring genera closely appressed; everywhere genera are thrust out like twigs, yet [the principal genera] are never connected to each other by lateral relationships."
[[48], pp.23-24]
His key points are that (1) animals and vegetables separate from each other immediately at the base of the trunk
and proceed upward on their own, forming a dichotomous trunk; (2) the animal and vegetable trunks nonetheless remain contiguous at various points; (3) the animal
(and separately, the plant) trunk is formed from series of
principal neighboring genera pressed closely against each
other; (4) genera are thrust out everywhere "like twigs";
and (5) no lateral relationships connect the principal genera (in the plant trunk or in the animal trunk).
Regarding the third of these points, Pallas wrote Hac figura
indicaretur simul Corpora organica, brutis non continua nec
affinia esse, sed tantum insistere ceu arbor solo. Truncus e principaliori generum affinium serie confertus. The word principaliori might be translated as more original or even earlier,
but we must be careful not to impute a temporal dimension. A 1787 German translation [[49], p.48] rendered
this passage Der aus der vorzüglichern Reihe anverwandter
und dicht für einander stehender Geschlechter zusammengesetzte Stamm..., which in turn may be translated "The trunk,
composed of the principal series of genera that are related
and stand compact to one another...". Unfortunately Pallas himself is not known ever to have sketched his tree, but
the sense conveyed is of a compound trunk - not the solid
trunk of the much later interpretation by Thienemann
[50], but instead a bunch of asparagus-shoots as in the
"tree of animal life" of Eichwald (Figure 4) [51]. Interestingly, Mikulinskii [[52], p.344; [53], p.315] presents
Eichwald's diagram as the first to have depicted Pallas's
tree.
Although a prolific author, Carl Edward von Eichwald is
little-known today outside Russian-language histories of
science (e.g. [52,53]) in which his name is given as Eduard
Ivanovich Eichwald. In his 1821 De regni animalis limitibus
[54], Eichwald states that animalcula (protozoa) "have
the rudiments of animal organization, from whence the
series of more-perfect animals evolve in ever-elaborating

grades and multifarous ramifications". He says repeatedly
that animals and plants proceed from a common primordium (for him an organisational concept, not an early
point in time), with the simple animals and simple plants
proximate in this primordium. Eichwald developed this
idea further in Zoologia specialis [51], proposing that the
six primary animal types (Spondylozoa; Podozoa, Taxozoa and Heterozoa; Therozoa; Grammozoa; Cyclozoa;
and Phytozoa) had originated in the primaeval shallow
ocean; the first type arose from abundant "globules of
primitive mucous", followed by the others in temporal
succession, each a branch off from, and elevated in relation to, the previous type [[51], p.41]. Zoologia specialis is
less overtly nature-philosophical than Eichwald's earlier
De regni animalis limitibus and clearly presents a branching, transformationist view of the origin of biodiversity.
According to Mikulinskii, however, Eichwald was "not
particularly a Darwinian in his later writings".
Even earlier in 1801, Augustin Augier [55] represented
plants on a multifurcating Arbre botanique, and considered
this representation to apply equally to animals and minerals:
"The order that I established among plants is found equally in
the three kingdoms of nature, and that seems to me a favorable
precedent for it to be regarded as natural. The three kingdoms
form three major series which begin with the least perfect beings
and end with the most perfect. Under the similarity of their
organizations, they are themselves made up of several series or
smaller families which are united by beings which, although
appearing to take the nature of two or several families, properly
belong neither to one nor the other, and by this form transitions;
this makes it difficult to find striking characters. Zoophytes
unite the three kingdoms; mammals are united to fish by the
whales, and birds to quadrupeds by bats, etc." (Augier [[55],
p.vii] as translated by Stevens [[43], p.206])
Stevens [43] finds no evidence that Augier intended this
tree to depict an evolution or transformation of species.
By contrast, Lamarck made evolutionary change, including the ongoing spontaneous creation of primitive forms
and the upward transformation of existing life, the centrepiece of his evolutionary theory. As mentioned above, in
Flore Françoise [14] he accepted a unitary scale of (plant)
life. Later, in Recherches sur l'organisation des corps vivants
[56] he drew back from fine-scaled continuity, although
he continued to find continuity across major internal
organ systems of animals [[57], p.128]. But to explain origins of specific groups of animals - cetaceans, for example
- he found it necessary to invoke branches. Lamarck's first
tree (Figure 5), presented in an addendum to his 1809
Philosophie zoologique [58], has few branches, whereas
those in Histoire naturelle des animaux sans vertèbres [[59], I
p.457] showed more (Figure 6). The titles of these trees

reveal their evolutionary intent: Tableau servant à montrer
l'origine des différens animaux and Ordre présumé de la formation des Animaux, offrant 2 séries séparées, subrameuses
respectively. Lamarck's theory of evolution was widely
known in his lifetime, but he persisted in linking it to idiosyncratic theories of chemistry and physics, and encountered scientific and political opposition from Cuvier and
others [60,61].
Trees returned a couple of decades later as a depiction of
the arrangement of nature (see below), but first we need
to introduce the most important alternative: networks.

Networks before Darwin
Remarkably, the network metaphor is older than that of a
branching tree. In his 1750 Della storia naturale marina
dell'Adriatico [62], Vitaliano Donati sought to describe the
arrangement of aquatic organisms. He argued that regu-

larities in nature allowed one to extrapolate from, or apply
analogies based on, the terrestrial (hence more easily
observable) Chain to understand the natural history of
organisms in the sea, where it may be that transitions
from the plant to the animal are most often encountered.
But the result was not a single Chain encompassing all
life, both terrestrial and aquatic:
When I observe the productions of Nature, I do not see one single and simple progression, or chain of beings, but rather I find
a great number of uniform, perpetual and constant progressions. [[62], p.xx]
Moreover, these numerous progressions are interconnected:
In each one of those orders, or Classes, nature forms its series
and presents its almost imperceptible passages from link to link
in its chains. In addition, the links of the chain are joined
[uniti] in such a way within the links of another chain, that the
natural progressions should have to be compared more to a net
[rete] than to a chain, that net being, so to speak, woven with
various threads which show, between them, changing communications, connections, and unions. [[62], p.xxi]
Where in the second sentence above I translate uniti as
joined, the 1758 French translation [63] renders it as
entrelacés, interlaced or intertwined.
Giuseppe Olivi [[64], I p.68] likewise found the network
an appealing metaphor for aquatic nature. Quoting Leibnitz to similar effect, Gottfried Treviranus wrote of nature
as being made of "thousands and many thousands of
chains, with endless skill entwined down to the smallest
knot" [[65], I pp.473-475]. As this quotation is from the
first book to use the word biology in a modern sense (Biologie, oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur), it can be said that
nature-as-network was present at the dawn of modern
biology.
We have already encountered the Eighteenth-century concept of affinity (above). Networks of affinities among
plants and among animals were depicted in great detail in
the late Eighteenth and very early Nineteenth centuries.
Notable examples appeared in the Ordines naturales
plantarum commentatio botanica of Johann Philipp Rühling
(Figure 7) [66], the Tabula affinitatum animalium of
Johann (Jean) Hermann (Figure 8) [67], and the Tabula
affinitatum regni vegetabilis of August Johann Georg Carl
Batsch (Figure 9) [68]. In the text Hermann identifies
some of these affinities in detail, for example those which,
in his opinion, link the rays (genus Raja) individually
with Mammalia, Amphibia, Insecta, Aves, Pisces and
Vermes [[67], p.295].

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/4/1/43

Treviranus argued [[65], I p.474) that whereas a chain
allows one to describe only a single facet of organisation,
with a network the complete organisation can be taken
into account. He did not specify which organisational features might comprise the network of organisms, but the
immediately previous section of his treatise discussed gradations in e.g. musculature, circulatory and nervous systems, and the brain. Nor did Treviranus propose that one
organisational feature (say, musculature) could be associated with the x-axis of a network diagram, and a second
feature (say, nervous-system organisation) with its y-axis;
he meant instead that gradations in multiple - indeed all features could be represented at fine scale, as adjacencies
within local neighborhoods of the network. Nor, to my
knowledge, did any network (or Linnaean map) proposed
in these decades depict affinity on one axis, and analogy
on the other.
Georges Cuvier later used the network analogy to emphasize the connectedness of all beings:
...our systematic methods consider only the nearest affinities;
they seek to place a being only between two others, and they are
unceasingly at fault; the true method sees each being in the
midst of all others; it shows all the radiations by which it is connected more or less closely within this immense network which
constitutes organised nature [[69], I p.569]
Networks appeared in a second, and very different, context shortly after 1750. Buffon held a somewhat idiosyncratic (and occasionally inconsistent) view of nature,
believing in the fixity of species while refusing to accept
the reality of higher taxa. Like Darwin much later, however, Buffon was interested in animal breeding and in the
diversity of forms it could yield. Buffon's well-known diagram of relationships among breeds of dogs (Figure 10)
[70] is not only a network but an explicitly genealogical
one, albeit in Buffon's view a special case due to the
human intervention that is required.

Other representations of nature before Darwin
In the passage translated above, Pallas [48] refers to polyhedric representations of order in nature other than series,
trees and networks. Here (as elsewhere) the 1787 German
translation takes some liberty with the Latin text, elaborating that these polyhedric figures have multiple surfaces
and compartments [[49], p.47]. I am unaware of pre-1766
representations that could have been so described, apart
perhaps from a particularly angular conceptualisation of
the Linnaean map. Fifty years later, however, we do
encounter a diversity of polyhedric representations of the
living world [54,71-73] (Figures 11, 12, 13, 14).
Notable among these alternative was the quinarian system, in which groups were arranged as a cycle of cycles.

Swainson [[74], p.91] credits the modern idea to Fischer
de Waldheim [[75], p.181], who in 1805 arrayed animals
in "a series of contiguous circles around Man as a centre".
As developed by Macleay [76], the animals are constituted
as five great natural groups (classes Acrita, Radiata, Annulosa, Vertebrata and Mollusca), each of which is further
divisible into five lesser groups; even the imperfectly
known Mollusca were unlikely to constitute an exception
to this "rule" [[76], p.321]. Arranging the five sub-groups
in each class into a circle would reveal a series of affinities
within that class; and arranging the five class-circles into a
larger ring would reveal affinities between sub-groups in
different classes, while identifying other similarities as
mere analogies [[76], p.319]. These analogies moreover
might be positioned non-randomly, e.g. forming axes as
in Swainson [[77], p.200] (Figure 15). Certain otherwise
problematic groups, such as Tunicata, could be placed as
"osculant" groups at the tangent between adjacent classes.
As in the Linnaean map, local affinities did not align
head-to-tail into a unitary series or chain: note the order

of classes Acrita → Mollusca → Vertebrata → Annulosa →
Radiata (→ Acrita) in Macleay's system, with the vertebrate sub-groups Aves and Mammalia as distant as possible from the acritan sub-group Agastria, the point of
contact with Vegetabilia [[76], p.318] (Figure 16). This
allowed Macleay to argue that Lamarck's 1809 tree was
really an un-recognised quinarian cycle (Figure 17); perhaps because he considered these regularities to be evidence of a divine design in nature [[76], pp.324-325 and
elsewhere], he did not ask whether, conversely, his cycles
might represent planar sections through Lamarck's trees.
Similarly a Venn-like diagram of animal taxa based on
embryology [78] might have been (but was not) presented as a planar section through a tree (or a sparse network, if its additional correspondences are to be
included).
The quinarian system was adopted by Vigors [79], Swainson [77], Lindley [[80], p.130; [81]] (Figure 18), Kaup
[82] and others, a seven-cycled system by Newman [83],

and a ten-cycled system by Elias Fries [84]; however, following criticism by Strickland [85] in 1841 these systems
began a terminal slide into disfavour. The quinarian system was nonetheless privileged with a lengthy chapter in
the (in)famous Vestiges [86], and found its way into the
popular literature in works such as Hugh Miller's Testimony of the Rocks [[87], p.493]. Darwin was thoroughly
aware of the quinarian system, and worried that his own
theory of natural selection might suffer a similar fate if
presented carelessly to the public [[88], note 5]. The
young Edward Drinker Cope sketched a quinarian classification of amphibia in 1857 [[89], p.258], and a variant
the theory was taught at the University of Toronto as late
as 1870 [81].

Trees 1837-1859
O'Hara [[44], p.256] characterizes the years 1840-1859 as
a "mapmaking" period, in which Strickland and Wallace
sought to banish analogy and symmetry (hence quinarian
circles and other geometric representations) from systematics. During these two decades at least four investigators
published tree diagrams, two depicting stratigraphic series
of fossils. From 1840 through at least 1856, in some thirty
editions of his popular textbook Elementary Geology,
Edward Hitchcock [90] presented a branching diagram
representing series of plant and animal fossils in successive strata. These diagrams had been removed by the 1860
edition [91]. Archibald [91] notes that Hitchcock did not
accept the transmutation of species, arguing against
Lamarck, Chambers (Vestiges) and later Darwin. Louis
Agassiz presented a similar tree-like depiction of fossil fish

in the first volume of his Recherches sur les poissons fossiles
[[92], pp.170-171]; like Hitchcock, Agassiz did not accept
a transmutation of species.
Alfred Russel Wallace, on the other hand, sought evidence
for transmutation of species during explorations in Brazil
(1848-1852) and the Malay Archipelago (1854-1862). In
1855 he communicated a paper referring to "branching of
the lines of affinity, as intricate as the twigs of a gnarled
oak or the vascular system of the human body", and later
to "the true Natural System of classification" needing to
order "the stem and main branches represented by extinct
species" as well as extant diversity, "a vast mass of limbs
and boughs and minute twigs and scattered leaves" [93].
In a remarkable paper published the following year, he

offered not only branching representations of affinities
among two groups of birds (Fissirostres and Scansores),
but also an explicit description of his method of treebuilding [[94], pp. 206-207]. Wallace accepted that there
exists a main axis along which many taxa can be arranged
in a series of affinities, while affinities of other taxa can be
represented as branches and sub-branches to the left and
right off this main axis. These affinities [[94], p.199] were
of structure and "economy" [[94], p.195], the latter term
connoting features of reproduction, nutrition, physiology
and ecology; branch lengths correspond with degree of
affinity, and gaps may occur at any point due to extinction
of families [[94], pp.206,214]. As a consequence, Wallace's trees (Figure 19) were both phylogenies (in the
modern sense of showing extant taxa at the branch-tips)

approach followed Lindley and Strickland against the quinarian system of Vigors and Swainson [[94],
pp.195,206,212].
In 1858 Heinrich Georg Bronn [95] depicted a system of
animals, as evidenced by the fossil record, in the form of
a branching diagram drawn to resemble an actual tree
(Figure 20) and described as a Baum-förmige Bilde des Systems with Äste (branches). His tree depicted a series of species, of increasing organisational perfection, succeeding

each other as time progresses; this succession continues
on all branches, although at any point in time some new
species are necessarily more-perfect than others on lower
branches [[96], pp.110-116]. Mikulinskii [53], p.316]
notes that Bronn had earlier cited Eichwald's Zoologia specialis [51], hence presumably had studied Eichwald's (Pallas's) tree. Bronn later made the first translations of Origin
of Species into German, adding footnotes and a chapter of
his own criticisms; one of these translations was read by
Haeckel [97].

Darwin's dangerous trees
In 1837, in his Notebook B [[98], B§21], Darwin famously
wrote
organised beings represent a tree. Irregularly branched some
branches far more branched. - Hence Genera. - «as many terminal buds dying, as new ones generated»

In successive notes (e.g. [[98], B§23,24]) he refers to "the
tree of life", and wondered whether "(t)he tree of life
should perhaps be called the coral of life" [[98], B§25].
Bredekamp [99] argues that the two small branching figures Darwin sketched first in Notebook B [[98], B§26]
were in fact inspired by specimens he himself had collected and thought to be corals (some later turned out to

these sketches to embryological diagrams by the physician
Martin Berry. Darwin's more-famous "I think" figure
[[98], B§36] (Figure 21), while topologically a tree, does
not resemble any actual botanical tree, nor does Darwin
call it a tree. The mathematical structure today known as a
tree (although not the term itself) was introduced a decade
later by Kirchhoff [101] and von Staudt [[102], pp.20-21],

while Arthur Cayley [103] is thought to have been the first
to call this structure a tree.
The only illustration in Origin of Species was an abstract
tree diagram (Figure 22):

speaks the truth. The green and budding twigs may represent
existing species; and those produced during each former year
may represent the long succession of extinct species. At each
period of growth all the growing twigs have tried to branch out
on all sides, and to overtop and kill the surrounding twigs and
branches, in the same manner as species and groups of species
have tried to overmaster other species in the great battle for life.
The limbs divided into great branches, and these into lesser and
lesser branches, were themselves once, when the tree was small,
budding twigs; and this connexion of the former and present
buds by ramifying branches may well represent the classification of all extinct and living species in groups subordinate to
groups. Of the many twigs which flourished when the tree was
a mere bush, only two or three, now grown into great branches,
yet survive and bear all the other branches; so with the species
which lived during long-past geological periods, very few now
have living and modified descendants. ... As buds give rise by
growth to fresh buds, and these, if vigorous, branch out and
overtop on all sides many a feebler branch, so by generation I
believe it has been with the great Tree of Life, which fills with
its dead and broken branches the crust of the earth, and covers

Darwin's theory of evolution shared points of similarity
with certain of the systems described in previous sections
of this paper, but was unique in their combination. Like
Lamarck and Wallace, he accepted the transmutation of
species. Unlike Bonnet, Lamarck, Eichwald, Bronn and
Haeckel, he rejected as a "miserable limited view" [[98],
B§216] the ongoing creation or appearance of new species, instead emphasising the continuity of genealogical
lineages from one or a small number of original forms.
Darwin did not base his tree on affinity, although successive generations "tend to inherit those advantages which
made their common parent (A) more numerous than
most of the other inhabitants of the same country" [[104],
p.118] (in this way, as Darwin put it, affinity will "grow"
[[98], C§151]). His tree is instead one of genealogical
inheritance. He placed extant taxa at the tips of his tree,
not at the internal nodes or along the branches. Darwin
described the struggle for existence in a Malthusian context, and importantly emphasised the central role of natural selection - his "dangerous idea" [[105], p.21] - without
recourse to a metaphysical formative force toward perfection or realisation of potential per Bonnet, Lamarck,
Eichwald and others.

Trees and networks after Darwin
Darwin attracted strong champions, including Thomas
Henry Huxley in the English-speaking world and Ernst
Haeckel on the Continent. Haeckel (following Bronn) did
not accept every detail of Darwin's argument, but agreed
that the natural system is necessarily genealogical, and
seized enthusiastically on Darwin's abstract branching
diagram as its form. Darwin had argued [104] that the
geological record was too incomplete to provide a basis
for fleshing-out this tree, so to speak, with actual taxa.
Haeckel would instead base his reconstruction method on
his so-called biogenetic law: the claim that an individual's
ontogeny recapitulated, or re-traced and summarized, its
phylogenetic history [106]. In this way he derived Stammbäume (genealogical trees), which he depicted as a
proper botanical trees [106,107] to which extant biological taxa were assigned (Figure 23). His initial trees were
refined and extended in great detail to numerous taxa.
Note that Haeckel did not call his trees phylogenies, reserving this term for a series of morphological stages [108];
how could ontogeny (a linear process in a single organism) recapitulate phylogeny, unless phylogeny too was
linear? The received meaning of phylogeny has since
evolved, of course, and is now used to mean genealogical
tree, even in contexts where only the branching topology
is relevant.

Although it lies outside the scope of this article to review
in detail the uptake of Darwin's theories and adoption of
the evolutionary tree as an explanation of modern biodiversity, I offer three case studies to illustrate that this
uptake and adoption progressed at different rates and to
varying extents, if at all, across different fields of biology.
Network diagrams [109] and geographical maps persisted
in some research communities; and today, as we shall see,
network representations are again resurgent in microbial
phylogenetics [110].
Vertebrates: trees in the ascendancy
Haeckel's visually striking and highly detailed trees of vertebrates (e.g. [106,107]) were widely discussed, not least
because they ventured to show the genealogical history of

man. By the later Nineteenth century it was reasonably
commonplace for monographs on vertebrate zoology to
include a branching tree of taxa. Debate persisted on
important concepts: Garrod [111], for instance, argued
that these trees must be interpreted as showing relationships among characters, not necessarily among taxa.
Sharpe [112] depicted Reichenow's Stammbaum of class
Aves as small boughs emerging at multiple points from
four thick, poorly differentiated basal "stems". In the
same work he also [112] represented a gracile, threedimensional tree of birds as views from the front, back,
side and top, adding planar sections at three different levels that linked the underlying cladogenic process to maprepresentations. Some of these figures have been reproduced and discussed by O'Hara [44,113]. Longitudinal

sections were explored in more detail in the early Twentieth century, for example to illustrate polyphyly and convergence [114]. Other dynamics continued to play out,
e.g. between topology-centric interpretation emphasizing
speciation (cladogenesis) and anagenic change along
branches (phylogenesis in sensu Haeckel). Trees were
sometimes annotated to show character distributions,
geographical spread, or quality of evidence [114]. Nonetheless the genealogical tree soon became established in
vertebrate zoology, as indeed in many other biological
domains.

ous macroscopic "least-perfect plants" into form-genera,
the number of which was revised upward or downward as
his system was refined [37]. With the dissolution of the
Great Chain, these form-genera were dissolved, and the
new groupings that replaced them were augmented with
monads (unicellular forms), a term that "thanks to Leibniz
[116] and the Naturphilosophes, bore strong connotations
of primitivity and potential" [37]. Some of these new taxa
began to be viewed as "the lowest step of the plant kingdom", i.e. as archetypes for the land plants [[117], p.1].
And plants they were agreed to be: Haeckel [106,118]
excluded brown and red algae, and macroscopic green
algae, from his new kingdom Protista. Lamouroux [119]
had introduced colour of spores and thalli as the key tax-

forms but also cyanobacteria and diverse protists (diatoms, xanthophytes, euglenoids) as "algae" in university
courses, textbooks, societies and conferences. A number
of these unicellular forms have colourless variants,
thereby undermining the generality of pigmentation as a
taxonomic character, while others (cryptomonads, chlorarachniophytes, some dinoflagellates) are the products of
secondary or tertiary endosymbioses [124-126]. More
than a century ago Klebs [127] depicted relationships
among unicellular algae as a network (Figure 26),
acknowledging nonetheless that it was "conceivable" that
the "indubitable network of lines of relationship" among
Pleurococcaceae, Volvocinae (and therewith the flagellates) and Confervoideae could be explained by Transmutationslehre, i.e. the theories of Darwin and Haeckel.

onomic feature, therewith recognizing Fucacées, Floridées
and Ulvacées; this approach had practical value (e.g. identification in the field) and immediately suggested how
unicells should be classified: yellow-brown unicells with
Fucacées, red with Floridées, and green with Ulvacées.
Given their substantial diversity, morphological plasticity,
complex and mysterious life histories, and near-absence
from the fossil record, one can understand why algae
were, and continued to be, arranged along morphoclines
within each colour-group. In discussing green or red algae,
for example, monographs and textbooks began (and still
begin) with unicellular forms, followed by colonies of
unicells, unbranched and branched filaments, sheets, and
finally thalli of increasing differentiation [e.g. [120],
pp.12-28; [121,122]] (Figures 24, 25). Even in the late
Twentieth century, some authorities held extrinsic factors
(competency, aesthetics, tradition, didactics, accepted
paradigms, and history of practice) to be paramount
("taxonomy is an art and taxonomists are thus artists")
[[123], p.428]. Many phycologists considered the phylogenetic perspective (in the sense of branching trees) an
unattainable ideal, or indeed distrusted it.
Unicellular algae proved to be particularly problematic to
bring into a phylogenetic system, with the already difficult
biology complicated by a tradition - persisting to the
present day - of including not only brown, red and green

Prokaryotes: disorder in nature
Microbiology developed largely after 1859 based on the
work of Cohn, Pasteur, Koch and others. Few if any pre1859 concepts were especially useful for systematizing
organisms that could scarcely be seen under the microscope and presented few morphological characters. Further physiological characters were eventually identified,
but they did not correlate in any simple or necessary way
with what could be seen of bacterial morphology, and
"every one of these characters is liable to variation" [[128],
p.6]. By the mid-1920s it had become clear that at least
some morphological and physiological characters of bacteria were rapidly and permanently transmutable under
laboratory conditions [128-131]. The problem space was
sharpened by excluding viruses, as non-living entities (but
cf. [132]), from the microbiological system; but early
expectations that a phylogenetic classification would
emerge for bacteria [133] were unrewarded, and by the
mid-Twentieth century there was considerable pessimism
that a natural evolutionary classification of bacteria was
even possible [134-139].

DNA was by this time known to be the genetic material,
and DNA-DNA hybridisation experiments revealed, if
crudely, a hierarchical structure of genetic similarity
among bacteria [140-142]. More interestingly, given the
structure of DNA, the nature of the genetic code and
details of transcription and translation, protein sequences
were "documents of evolutionary history" [143]; statistical approaches were developed to infer this history from
sets of homologous sequences, and believable trees of
relationships could often be inferred for eukaryotes, especially animals [144-149]. By contrast, however, the initial
applications to prokaryotes were often less than successful
due to restricted or sporadic distribution of genes, uncertain orthology, and/or lack of phylogenetic signal [150153].

Great Tree of Life, from Origin of Species by Charles Robert Darwin (1859)
Figure 22
Great Tree of Life, from Origin of Species by Charles Robert Darwin (1859).

It was against this background that George Fox and Carl
Woese initiated comparative analyses of RNA sequences
[154-156]. In particular, the recognition of small-subunit
ribosomal RNA (ssu-rRNA) as a universally distributed,
well-behaved "molecular chronometer" [157] led to considerable optimism that the natural evolutionary classification of bacteria was finally at hand. This is what seemed,
at first, to happen: Woese and colleagues delineated hierarchical groups among bacteria, identified the bacterial
groups from among which chloroplasts and mitochondria had arisen (see also [158]) and, more controversially,
reported that certain accepted groupings of bacteria
(indeed "bacteria" themselves) were not, according to ssurRNA, monophyletic [157,159-161]. By the late 1980s the
iconic "three kingdoms tree" of ssu-rRNA sequences (Figure 27) was increasingly assumed to be the Tree of Life.
Indeed ssu-rRNA sequences began to serve as proxies for
the corresponding organisms, allowing bacteria recalcitrant to isolation or culture, or unseen within a complex
environmental sample, to be brought into the new phylogenetic framework [162].

As further sequences became available and phylogenetic
inference grew more-sophisticated, trees were inferred for
numerous gene families. Against almost universal expectation (but cf. [163]), however, these single-gene topologies failed to tell a fully consistent phylogenetic story,
particularly for prokaryotes. Patterns of topological incongruence among different trees, or between a gene- or protein-family tree and a reference topology, came to be
interpreted as prima facie evidence for lateral (horizontal)
genetic transfer [164-171]. Genome histories that include
both vertical (parent-to-offspring) and lateral components take the form of networks [110,165-172] (Figures
28, 29, 30). Scope remains for further methodological
improvement, for example in better delineating the
genomic units of phylogenetic analysis [173] and making
better use of gene-content and gene-order data [174]. The
final story may not have been written, but it is not
unthinkable that we are witnessing the demise of the universal tree-of-life paradigm [171,175]. At minimum, the
Tree of Life may "emerge, if at all, from the multi-genome
era much more restricted in scope, and subject to many
more qualifications, than could have been anticipated a
dozen years ago" [[110], p.2169] - for example, as a Net-

Conclusion

In this article I have attempted to situate Darwin's trees in
historical context, specifically the search for the natural
system following the abandonment of the Great Chain of
Being. His trees existed, and exist, in other contexts (e.g.
sociological, political, religious) which I do not consider
here. Darwin was not the first to propose that the system
of nature is tree-like, nor that species undergo transmutation along hierarchically branching temporal trajectories.
In the decades following 1859, genealogical trees won
acceptance in some but certainly not all areas of biology;
nor indeed have trees won full acceptance even today,
although they remain default hypotheses for most biologists, as indeed more broadly in science and in society. But
nature-as-network preceded the branching tree, was never

Darwin's trees played an integral role in his theory, linking process (genealogical descent-with-modification, plus
extinction) with outcome (the diversity of past and

classification). Trees also provided a common, coherent,
and (although this would be discovered only later) mathematically and statistically tractable framework linking
much outside his argument per se, from comparative anatomy and development to palaeontology and biogeography, to evolutionary theory, with the result that now
"nothing makes sense in biology except in the light of evolution, sub specie evolutionis" [[176], p.449]. Darwin's trees
are justly considered a landmark not only of biology and

Reviewer comments
This article offers a broad overview of the use of trees and
networks in biology. The figures compiled by the authors
are fascinating, and the demonstration that the network is
not an odd concept for classifiers (and for evolutionists)
is of significant importance. I encourage all curious biologists to read this piece.

1. What about the (endo)symbiotic theories and their
support for networks after Darwin? Although their impact
became significant sometimes only with delay, they are
very briefly mentioned here. They have however certainly
contributed to the debate around the tree-like vs web-like
nature of evolution/classification (and for some of them,
they have produced historically important drawings, such
as Mereschkowsky's anastomosing scheme (and its multiple roots), or even such as Dagan and Martin webs of
genomes, which recently made the cover of Philosophical
Transactions of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences. Thus would not it be worth, for instance, to discuss
the contribution of Sagan/Margulis to the issue of network after Darwin a bit more? On p.2, the author suggests
that "networks were reintroduced in the mid-1990", could
not it be argued that with Margulis' piece and the subsequent studies promoted by her hypothesis, networks were
reintroduced before? Finally, any contemporary web of
genomes might be too recent to deserve a room in this historical paper, but I wonder whether including Dagan's
web of genomes as a final picture of a biological network
would not be appropriate.

Author's response
I am delighted to acknowledge the important work by
Lynn Sagan (now Margulis) [178,179] which catalysed
my own interest in the endosymbiotic theory of eukaryotic origins. Her argument encompassed the origin of
eukaryotic cells by serial endosymbioses, the stepwise origin of mitosis, the non-existence of certain hypothetical
intermediates, implications for high-level classification,
and correlations with geochemical conditions on Earth but was never, to my knowledge, explicitly abstracted as a
story of network versus tree. Instead she mapped eukaryotic diversity as a unitary tree of mitosing cells, into which
endosymbionts arrived at defined points on certain
branches. I am likewise pleased to call attention to the visually compelling network diagrams by Dagan and Martin
recently featured on the cover of Philosophical Transactions
of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences (volume
364 number 1527, 12 August 2009). Addressing the
Reviewer's point more broadly, I have now added a ribosomal RNA-based "three kingdoms tree" (Figure 27) and

three network diagrams (Figures 28, 29, 30) including one
from Dagan and Martin (Figure 30).
Reviewer comments
I am a bit puzzled by the description of Aristotle's works
only as supporting a great chain of beings to classify every
taxon. I think this is too partial a view of his deep - and
influential - philosophical analyses. In my understanding
(and I believe consistently with what is found in the philosophy textbooks), Aristotle is known for having produced multiple classifications of beings, based on
different characters. In short, Aristotle proposed multiple
independent trees of beings, at a very high taxonomic
level. Yet, he did not build them in an inductive way. It
may be worth considering this latter point a bit more. That
Aristotle was somehow a taxonomical pluralist (aka an
author attracted by the reconstruction of multiple "nascent" trees) shows that (i) the question of adopting one vs
many classifications, and (ii) the question whether these
classifications were natural versus conventional/arbitrary

systems, are also part of an ancient debate in biology,
directly connected with the use of trees and networks in
biology. I am thus curious to know, for each of the historical drawings presented in that manuscript, whether these
schemes were considered by their authors as the natural
picture of diversity, or mostly as some practical/"arbitrary" representations (of which they may even have proposed simultaneously many).
Author's response
Aristotle's Great Chain is not a classification: indeed in De
partibus animalium (643b10-644a11) he argues that it is
impossible to construct a single, logically consistent classification of organisms by dichotomous division, and that
no series of differentiae can express the essence of an animal species. Some commentators have argued that there
coexist in Aristotle both technical and non-technical
senses of his terms genos, eidos, and diafora (genus, species,
differentia) [[180]; [181], p.53]. Aristotle did present log-

ical hierarchies for different overlapping sets of animals
based on their sensitivity, attachment, motility, ovipary or
other characters, and I agree that one might ask whether
this makes Aristotle the first taxonomic pluralist. Of
course none of this prevented various Sixteenth to Eighteenth-century authors from presenting unitary "Aristotelian" classifications of animals.
The question of whether these 30 figures, and indeed hundreds of others, depict their authors' view of the natural
system, or instead were intended to serve only a limited
utilitarian purpose, must remain beyond the scope of this
paper. Herbals and bestiaries were utilitarian, as in general
were keys such as the one from Zaluziansky (Figure 3);
and Lamarck is said to have considered his early scale of
plants [14] as "unscientific".

"A reticulated tree, or net, which might more appropriately represent life's history", by W. Ford Doolittle. Figure reproduced from [171] by permission of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The author indicates that Lamarck's trees are a temporal
progression. This is not entirely accurate: they are rather
the path of the evolutionary progress that is repeatedly
explored by life, at all times, since Lamarck believed in
spontaneous generation. His trees are certainly polarized
in time in the sense that the highest form in the trees has
to appear before the lowest ones, as the evolution
progresses. However each form in the tree is also an evolutionary/developmental stage at which some creatures
stay (when they do not keep evolving). The chronology is
thus messed up in these drawings. For instance, there are
both recent and ancient polyps, some of which are then
more recent than some of the Ascidians, although the
Ascidians as a form are "lower" than the polyps on the
tree.
Author's response

In the paragraph in question, I introduce Lamarck's evolutionary theory by stating that "Lamarck made evolutionary change, including the ongoing spontaneous creation
of primitive forms and the upward transformation of
existing life, the centrepiece of his evolutionary theory."
His trees are based on temporal progression, but not of a
kind familiar to us post-Darwinians. I have now reworded this sentence to read: "The titles of these trees
reveal their evolutionary intent...".
Reviewer comments
The section "Trees before Darwin" should be entitled
"Biological trees before Darwin", because it does not comment, for instance, on Porphyry's most important trees in
philosophy. Likewise, in the conclusion, the author
should recall that the trees he introduced are presented in

the historical context of biology. Otherwise, he would have
had to comment on the most interesting fact that, at the
very same date than Darwin published his famous tree,
outside the field of biology, in linguistics and philology, a
most famous tree of languages was also published by
August Schleicher.
Author's response
Medieval illustrated manuscripts depict various dichotomies and arbores representing concepts e.g. from logic
(notably the "tree of Porphyry" based on his Isagoge, itself
a commentary on Aristotle's Categoriae and De Interpretatione), genealogy (a famous one is attributed to Isidore of
Seville, ca 560 - 636 AD) and mysticism (the Sephirotic
tree, actually a network) [182,183]. The Reviewer rightly
reminds us too of Schleicher's Stammbaumtheorie,
depicted as a tree in publications beginning in 1853 [for a
reproduction see [184], p.46]. August Schleicher, a professor at Jena, read Darwin's Origin on his colleague Ernst
Haeckel's advice, and subsequently wrote articles present-

ing the origin and development of languages as a validation of Darwin's theory.
Reviewer comments
What does "emanationist" mean? Could the author
describe this notion a bit more? Also, what does "osculant" mean?
Author's response
Emanationist describes unitary philosophical or cosmological systems according to which all that exists (the universe and everything within it) has arisen through a
process of flowing-out from, and willed by, a deity or First
Principle. This flowing-out necessarily gives rise to a hierarchy or continuum of entities of which those closest to
the First Principle are the most-perfect, while those farther
away are increasingly material, embodied and imperfect.
These systems are to be contrasted with those positing a

Reviewer comments
The history of the metaphors used by biologists to depict
relationships between organisms is a fascinating story that
Mark Ragan presents in this paper in a lively and exhaus-

tive way. I discovered in reading his paper that the metaphor of networks, so fashionable right now among
evolutionists fascinated by lateral gene transfers, indeed
predated the tree metaphor in pre-Darwinian times.
Unfortunately, there is a great confusion in the use of the
network metaphor right now. The hereditary history of
living organisms can be depicted with a tree-like structure
as long as new organisms originate by cell division. This
seems to be the rule for most living organisms, since
examples of fusion that prevent us from identifying the
continuity of cellular lineages are rare. For instance plants
are clearly a eukaryotic lineage that can be inserted into a
eukaryotic tree, and not a peculiar lineage of cyanobacteria. Similarly, mammals are clearly a branch in the tree of
animals, and not a peculiar form of retrovirus despite the
fact that retroviruses and derived element comprise up to
80% of their genomes. It was one of the great successes of

science in the XIX century to realize that organisms are
related to each other via a tree and not a network. This was
achieved thanks to progress in evolutionary theory and it's
not a coincidence that the only illustration of the origin of
species is precisely such a tree. The merit of the historical
approach as depicted in Ragan's paper is to remind us that
this tree did not come from nowhere but had to fight its
way out of various pre-scientific networks. These networks
were designed to take into account various observations
that were not understood at the time, such as the existence
of homologous characters in organisms from diverse lineages. We know now that these homologies are produced
by common descent, by gene transfer between lineages, or
by convergence, different processes that were combined in
misleading ways in these old networks. Networks are
again fashionable because organisms are now frequently
confused with their genes and/or genomes (see a recent
excellent review by Gribaldo and Brochier-Armant [185]
on this issue). Genomes as integrated entities and genes
taken independently evolve in a tree-like fashion (DNA
replication produces tree-like heredity) but genomes are
composed of genes whose history can vary from one gene
to the other. A network is indeed a good metaphor to
describe the movement of genes between genomes across
the tree of organisms. This is especially true for genes originally encoded by viruses and their derivatives, plasmids,
transposons and integrons. In that case, entire genomes
from different organisms (virus-virus, virus-plasmids or
plasmid-plasmid) can recombine to produce new lineages, which can be assimilated to a fusion. The evolutionary process is therefore a combination of tree-like
processes (the evolution of cellular lineages from LUCA
until now, the evolution of genes in general, the evolution
of viral/plasmids lineages during much part of their history) and of network-like processes (the movement of
genes between lineages, the formation of new plasmid/
virus lineage by recombination). From this account by
Mark Ragan, it seems that this dual nature of the evolutionary process has never been taken into account in the
history of biology and that the tree and network metaphors were always considered to be in opposition. This
may derive from the difficulty for most scientists of adopting a dialectic view of nature (evolution is both trees and
networks) and their propensity to adopt a mechanistic
approach (either/or) that favours opposition (between
metaphors and, as a consequence, between scientists, who
favour different metaphors!). Both historical and philosophical approaches may be required now to get rid of
these false oppositions.
