Abstract
Background: The latency of HIV-1 in resting CD4+ T-lymphocytes constitutes a major obstacle for the eradication of virus in
patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). As yet, no approach to reduce this viral reservoir has proven effective.
Methods: Nine subjects on effective ART were included in the study and treated with high dosage intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIG) for five consecutive days. Seven of those had detectable levels of replication-competent virus in the latent reservoir and
were thus possible to evaluate. Highly purified resting memory CD4+ T-cells were activated and cells containing replicationcompetent HIV-1 were quantified. HIV-1 from plasma and activated memory CD4+ T-cells were compared with single genome
sequencing (SGS) of the gag region. T-lymphocyte activation markers and serum interleukins were measured.
Results: The latent HIV-1 pool decreased with in median 68% after IVIG was added to effective ART. The reservoir decreased
in five, whereas no decrease was found in two subjects with detectable virus. Plasma HIV-1 RNA ³ 2 copies/mL was detected
in five of seven subjects at baseline, but in only one at follow-up after 8–12 weeks. The decrease of the latent HIV-1 pool and
the residual plasma viremia was preceded by a transitory low-level increase in plasma HIV-1 RNA and serum interleukin 7 (IL7) levels, and followed by an expansion of T regulatory cells. The magnitude of the viral increase in plasma correlated to the size
of the latent HIV-1 pool and SGS of the gag region showed that viral clones from plasma clustered together with virus from
activated memory T-cells, pointing to the latent reservoir as the source of HIV-1 RNA in plasma.
Conclusion: The findings from this uncontrolled proof-of-concept study suggest that the reservoir became accessible by IVIG
treatment through activation of HIV-1 gene expression in latently-infected resting CD4+ T-cells. We propose that IVIG should
be further evaluated as an adjuvant to effective ART.

Background
Although antiretroviral treatment (ART) has substantially
improved the prognosis for HIV-infected patients, it does
not cure the infection. Replication-competent HIV-1 persists in a stable, latent reservoir, primarily in resting CD4+
T-lymphocytes [1,2]. This reservoir enables long-term persistence of the infection during otherwise effective ART.
Other cellular pools and tissue reservoirs, such as the central nervous system, may also be obstacles to the eradication of HIV-1 [3].
The present study focuses on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as an adjuvant to effective ART and investigates
its potential effect on the latent reservoirs. Our interest in
IVIG was prompted by observing the response of an HIV1-infected subject with Guillain-Barré Syndrome who had
been treated with IVIG and ART. Apart from a viral blip
during IVIG treatment, HIV-1 RNA remained undetectable several months after the cessation of ART [4]. We
hypothesized that IVIG contributed to activation of HIV-1
in latently-infected cells, leading to a transient increase in
plasma viral load, and followed by a decrease in infected
T-lymphocytes. These events then contributed to the relatively long period of undetectable viral load after ART
interruption. The present proof-of-concept study was conducted to explore this hypothesis.

Materials and methods
Patients
Nine patients followed at the Department of Infectious
Diseases, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Gothenburg,
Sweden, with continuous ART for ³ 2 years and plasma
HIV-1 RNA levels < 50 copies/mL ³ 1.5 years, were
included in the study. Written informed consent was
obtained and the study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at the University of Gothenburg and the
Medical Products Agency of Sweden. Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Seven subjects had detectable levels of replication-competent virus in the latent

http://www.aidsrestherapy.com/content/6/1/15

pool and were thus possible to evaluate regarding changes
of the latent reservoir. Two patients had undetectable
virus both before and after intervention with IVIG (subjects 1 and 5). All subjects received 30 g IVIG per day as
intravenous infusions for five consecutive days (Kiovig®,
Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Chicago, IL, USA). ART
was continued throughout the study period.
Purification and quantification of resting memory CD4+ Tcells
Quantification of HIV-1 in resting memory T-cells was
performed before, and 8–12 weeks after initiation of IVIG.
Resting CD4+ T-cells were isolated from peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC) by negative selection. PBMCs
were obtained by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation from 180 mL of peripheral blood. The PBMCs
were washed twice with PBS Buffer (pH 7.2 to 7.4) that
contained 0.1% BSA and 2 mM EDTA. After the first wash,
the cells were resuspended in PBS Buffer, and after the second wash in 30 mL of culture medium (RPMI+L-glut,
10% FCS and PenStrept), then transferred to a tissue culture flask and placed flat overnight at 37°C in a 5% CO2
incubator to remove monocytes by adherence. The following day the monocytes-depleted PBMCs were further
purified using a Dynal CD4 Negative Isolation Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The kit contains magnetic
beads and a monoclonal antibody mix directed towards
CD8, CD14, CD16a,b, CD56, CDw123, Glycophorin A,
and HLA Class II DR/DP. Additional monoclonal antibodies, Mouse-anti-human CD8 and CD25 (AbD Serotec,
Kidlington, Oxford, England), were added to the monoclonals in the Dynal kit and incubated at 4°C for 20 min.
During the incubation period, 100 uL beads/107 cells
were washed in PBS Buffer. The PBMCs were washed and
magnetic beads were added for another incubation period
of 15 min in RT. The bead and cell mix were put into a
magnetic rack and the supernatant containing purified
resting CD4+ T-cells was collected. The purity of the cell
supernatant was checked by flow cytometry.

Detection and quantification of latently-infected resting
CD4+ T-cells were performed by a limiting dilution culture
assay, as previously described [5]. Serial five-fold dilutions
of cells (106, 200,000, 40,000, 8,000, 1,600, and 320)
were set up in duplicates and induced to express replication-competent HIV-1 by exposure to 0.5 (-2.0) ug/mL of
the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA), 10 (-100) U/mL
interleukin 2 (IL-2), and allogeneic irradiated PBMCs,
ratio 1:10. The day after activation, the culture supernatants were removed and fresh culture medium was added.
To allow detection of virus growth, the resting CD4+ Tcells were also co-cultured with CD8+ depleted CD4+ lymphoblasts from healthy donors. These blasts had been prepared by stimulation with 0.5 ug/mL PHA two days before
being added to the cultures. On the seventh day after activation, the cells were split and a new set of blasts were
added to the cultures. The cultures were then incubated at
37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2 and were
fed and split as needed. Supernatants were collected on a

weekly basis and tested for the presence of HIV-1 p24 antigen with Architect i2000 HIV-1 Ag/Ab Combo Detection
System (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL, USA).
Statistical analysis by the maximum likelihood method
provided estimates of the infected cell frequencies
expressed as infectious units per million (IUPM) resting
CD4+ T-cells [6]. Samples with undetectable growth were
estimated to 0.25 IUPM cells, i.e. half the concentration of
the lowest possible estimate (0.5 IUPM) of detectable
growth. The estimate 0.5 IUPM is the maximum likelihood estimate when only one of the two replicates at the
highest concentration reveals presence of infected cells
and all other dilutions are negative
Quantification of HIV-1 RNA in plasma

Hoffman-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland). In order to yield
a detection limit of 2 copies/mL, 8.25 mL of plasma were
ultracentrifuged at 180,000 G in 4°C for 30 min prior to
quantification [7].
Viral RNA extraction from plasma and supernatants from
activated memory T-cells
A volume of 3 mL plasma from subjects 2 and 7, containing 57 and 81 copies of HIV-1 RNA, respectively, was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 1 hr at 4°C. After centrifugation,
the supernatant was removed and the virion pellet resuspended in 150 uL PBS (pH 7.4). The cell-free supernatants
from the cultures were collected and 150 uL was used with
the addition of 5 ug cRNA for extraction of HIV-1 RNA
using the RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). The 24 Plus Vacuum Manifold (Qiagen) was
used for fast and efficient vacuum processing of QIAGEN
spin columns. Extracted viral RNA was eluted in 30 uL of
MilliQ water with the addition of 1 uL RNase inhibitor
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The entire viral RNA
extraction was used for cDNA synthesis. To avoid contamination issues, the extraction and amplification of each
patient's cell culture supernatant and plasma samples
were carried out separately.
Single genome sequencing (SGS)
cDNA synthesis was performed using the ThermoScript
RT-PCR System (Invitrogen) with gene-specific primer 5'TCTTTCATTTGRTGTCCTTC-3' (HXB2 nt position 2063–
2044) (0.1 uM). To obtain PCR products derived from
single cDNA molecules, a modified version of a previously described method was used [8]. Designed subtype
B-specific primers were selected to amplify the HIV-1 p24
region of gag, using a nested PCR with Platinum Taq DNA
Polymerase (Invitrogen). First round PCRs used forward
primer 5'-CATMTAGTATGGGCAAGCAG-3' (HXB2 nt
position 886–905) and reverse primer (described above).
This was followed by a nested PCR, where each PCR product was subsequently used as a template, with forward
primer 5'-GTCAGCCAAAATTACCCTA-3' (HXB2 nt position
1171–1189)
and
reverse
primer
5'GTCAGCCAAAATTACCCTA-3' (HXB2 nt position 2048–
2030). To obtain PCR products for SGS, the cDNA was
diluted until approximately 30% of the PCR reactions
yielded DNA product [9]. Positive nested PCRs were identified by agarose gel electrophoresis, using E-Gel 96 1%
agarose (Invitrogen).

After purification, sequencing was conducted using the
BigDye Terminator Version 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), purified
through Sephadex G-50 (GE Healthcare) in a MultiScreen-HV Plate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and
detected in the ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems). Sequences were imported and
manually edited using Sequencher software (Gene Codes,

http://www.aidsrestherapy.com/content/6/1/15

Ann Arbor, MI, USA). We obtained 10 and 15 single
genomes from the plasma samples of subjects 2 and 7,
respectively. The supernatant samples of cell cultures generated 23 to 38 single genomes corresponding to each
time point.
Phylogenetic analysis
Sequences were aligned using BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor (Citeline, New York, NY, USA), with reference sequences from the HIV sequence database http://
hiv-web.lanl.gov to exclude the possibility of contamination. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using MEGA4.0
software (Center for Evolutionary Functional Genomics,
The Biodesign Institute, Tempe, AZ, USA). Bootstrap testing (500 replicates) of phylogeny was performed using
neighbor-joining, implementing pairwise deletion of gaps
and gamma distribution (0.5) among sites. The sequences
have been submitted to GenBank [J496870-FJ497003].
Immunological assays
Peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were measured by direct immunofluorescence in a flow cytometer.
T-cell assays, flow cytometry, and mAbs
The following mAbs were used: anti-CD3 PE-Cy7, antiCD4 FITC, anti-CD8 PerCP, anti-CD25 PE, anti-CD38
FITC PE-Cy7, anti-CD127 Alexa647, anti-HLA-DR APCCy7, anti-IFNg FITC, anti-MIP-1b PE, and anti-IL-2 APC,
all from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA, USA). TNFa
Pacific Blue from eBioscience, Anti-CD3 Pacific Blue from
Dako (Copenhagen, Denmark), and Aqua Live/Dead cell
exclusion marker from Invitrogen were used. For each
sample 7 × 105 freshly isolated PBMC were stained in a 96well v-bottomed plate on ice for 30 min, washed three

Phylogenetic analysis of HIV-1 sequences from the latent reservoir and plasma. Phylogenetic trees of aligned
sequences obtained by SGS from patient 2 (A) and 7 (B) were determined using the neighbour-joining distance method. From
patient 2, a total of 15 SGS were obtained from the plasma sample 16 days after initiation of IVIG treatment (2.PLd16); 23 SGS
from the supernatant at baseline (2.BL); and 38 SGS from the supernatant of activated T-cells 85 days after initiation of IVIG
treatment (2.d85). From patient 7, 10 SGS were obtained from the plasma sample 15 days after initiation of IVIG (7.PLd15); 26
SGS from the supernatant at baseline (7.BL); and 23 SGS from the supernatant 57 days after initiation of IVIG treatment
(7.d57). A close relationship was found between the HIV-1 RNA from plasma-activated T-cells and the SGS from the T-cell culture. This correlation falls within the cluster of plasma sequences, implying that activation of the latent reservoir can be the
source of plasma HIV-1 RNA found during IVIG treatment. Bootstrap values > 70 are indicated in the trees.

HIV-Gag p55 peptide pool (JPT Peptide Technologies,
Berlin, Germany) and the HIV-Nef peptide pool (NIH,
Germantown, MD, USA) were used to study the HIV-1specific responses, and a CMV, EBV, and Flu (CEF) control
peptide pool, as well as Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B
(SEB) (SIGMA-Aldrich Logistic GmbH, Schnelldorf, Germany), were added as positive controls. The PBMCs were
plated at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/well, along with
peptides at a final concentration of 2 ug/mL per peptide in
the pool, and incubated at 37°C for 12 hrs. As a negative
control, cells were incubated with medium only to determine the background responses for each patient. For
intracellular staining of cytokines, cells were stained for
surface markers before permeabilization with Perm/Fix
solution (BD Biosciences) at 4°C for 20 min. Cells were

Multicolor flow cytometry data was acquired on a CyAn
ADP instrument (Dako) [10]. Data were analyzed using
FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA).
Cytokine analysis
Plasma samples from all patients were analyzed for the
presence of IL-2 and IL-7 cytokines on a Luminex 100™
System (Luminex Corp, Austin, TX, USA). The procedure
is described in a protocol supplied with the IL-2 and IL-7
Human Singleplex Bead Kits (Invitrogen). Abs from the
two kits were combined, and undiluted plasma samples
were thoroughly mixed, centrifuged, and filtered prior to
analysis.
Statistical analysis
Wilcoxon's Signed Rank Test was used for pairwise comparisons, the Mann-Whitney U-test for comparisons
between two independent groups, and Spearman's Rank
Correlation Coefficient for evaluations of correlations.

Results
The latent HIV-1 pool decreased with a median of 68%
after IVIG treatment (Table 2). When the individual subjects were scrutinized, a decrease in the latent reservoir
was found in five (Figure 1a). Of the two subjects who
experienced no decrease in the reservoir, one had a low
pre-treatment viral load in resting cells, and in the other
replication-competent virus went from undetectable to
just detectable (0.5 IUPM) (Figure 1b). The five subjects
with decrease of their reservoirs had a similar pattern of
detectable HIV-1 RNA in plasma (6 to 27 copies/mL) two
weeks after initiation of IVIG (Figure 1a). A close correlation was found between the maximal plasma viral load
and levels of IUPM cells before IVIG treatment, rs = 0.86,
p = 0.0045 (Figure 2). We also compared virus obtained
from plasma and activated memory T-cells, using SGS of
gag in subjects 2 and 7. Both had sufficiently high plasma
viral loads to lead us to believe that sequencing would be
possible. Plasma sequences were derived 15 days (subject
7) and 16 days (subject 2) after initiation of IVIG, when
the plasma viral load was 19 and 27 copies/mL, respectively. In both, viruses from plasma and the T-cell reservoir were closely related, and clustered together in a
distinct branch (bootstrap value > 90) in the phylogenetic
trees (Figure 3). The SGS obtained from activated T-cells
probably reflects an oligoclonal expansion in the culture
of the most replication-competent HIV-1 in the resting Tcell population.
Plasma HIV-1 RNA was detectable (2–8 copies/mL) in five
of the seven subjects at baseline, but in only one at followup after 8–12 weeks (Figure 1).

Serum IL-7 levels increased during the first eight days after
IVIG initiation in subjects whose viral reservoirs decreased
(Figure 1a). No such pattern was found for IL-2 (data not
shown). We could not detect any change in CD4+ T-cell
counts or difference in activation of CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells,
as measured by expression of CD25, CD38, or HLA-DR, or
any effect on HIV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses against
Gag and Nef peptide pools (data not shown). However, a
consistent increase in CD25+CD127- regulatory T-cells
(Tregs) [11], from median 1.4 (IQR: 0.96–2.2)% to 2.3
(1.3–3.3)%, was found in all subjects after IVIG treatment, p = 0.0036 (Figure 4).

Discussion
The latency of HIV-1 in resting CD4+ T-lymphocytes constitutes a major obstacle for the eradication of the virus in
patients on ART. The decay rate of the latent reservoir in
such patients is extremely slow [2,12,13] and the substantial decrease of the reservoir found in five of the subjects
in this study is thus notable.
In accordance, also the plasma viremia decreased after
IVIG treatment and went below the detection limit of 2
copies/mL in all but one subject. Stable low-level residual
plasma viremia can normally be detected in the majority
of HIV-1-infected patients on suppressive ART [14].
IVIG is currently used to treat autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Its effects are complex and involve modulation of expression and function of Fc receptors;
interference with complement activation and the cytokine
network; effects on the activation and function of lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and macrophages; and provision
of anti-idiotypic antibodies [15-17]. We suggest that the
observed effect of IVIG on the latent reservoir may be
mediated by an activation of HIV-1 gene expression in
latently-infected T-cells. This hypothesis is consistent with
our finding of a transient IVIG-induced increase in plasma
viral load. A close correlation between the magnitude of
the viral increase in plasma and the size of the latent HIV1 pool, together with findings from SGS of the gag region,
indicate that HIV-1 in plasma originated from the pool of
latently-infected T-cells.
Expression of Fc gamma receptors on T cells is rare [18].
However, expression of the FcRgammaIIIA (CD16) can be
found on small subsets of T cells and a direct effect of IVIG
on such T cells can not be excluded [19,20]. However,
given that most T cells lack Fc receptors, the effect of IVIG
on HIV-1 activation is probably indirect and may be
mediated by cytokines. It is known that IL-7 can activate
virus expression, and it has, in conjunction with an antiHIV immunotoxin, been shown to reduce the latent reservoir in a mouse model [21]. IL-7 also seems to induce proviral reactivation from resting T-lymphocytes isolated
from HIV-1-infected patients on ART [22]. All subjects

http://www.aidsrestherapy.com/content/6/1/15

with decreased viral reservoirs in our study increased their
serum levels of IL-7 during IVIG treatment, suggesting a
role for IL-7 in mediating the effect of IVIG on the latent
reservoir. The source of IL-7 detected in response to IVIG
treatment is uncertain. However, in general the primary
sources of IL-7 are stromal and epithelial cells, but also
other sites of IL-7 production exist, including intestinal
epithelium, liver and dendritic cells [23].
A consistent increase of Tregs was found after IVIG treatment. Tregs have the capacity to suppress the activation
and proliferation of effector lymphocytes and thereby
down-modulate chronic inflammation [24]. Expansion of
Tregs by IVIG has been demonstrated previously [25].
Interestingly, HIV-1 infected individuals who control
viremia without ART (so-called elite controllers) maintain
high levels of these cells [26]. Tregs can limit the chronic
immune activation associated with HIV-1 infection but it
is unlikely that Tregs are directly involved in the activation
of latent HIV-1.
Strategies to decrease the cellular reservoir of HIV-1 in
latently-infected CD4+ T-lymphocytes have been proposed earlier [27-32]. However, no approach has as yet
proven effective. The present study suggests that IVIG may
decrease the size of the latently HIV-infected memory
CD4+ T-cell pool. The conclusion is strengthened by the
findings of transient increase in plasma virus that probably originated from resting T-cells and decreased number
of subjects with detectable residual plasma viremia. However, it has to be emphasized that this was a small uncontrolled proof-of-concept study and the results need to be
replicated and extended in larger studies.
