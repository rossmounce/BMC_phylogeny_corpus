Abstract
Background: Campylobacter jejuni is widespread in the environment and is the major cause of
bacterial gastroenteritis in humans. In the present study we use microarray-based comparative
genomic hybridizations (CGH), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and multilocus sequence
typing (MLST) to analyze closely related C. jejuni isolates from chicken and human infection.
Results: With the exception of one isolate, the microarray data clusters the isolates according to
the five groups determined by PFGE. In contrast, MLST defines only three genotypes among the
isolates, indicating a lower resolution. All methods show that there is no inherit difference between
isolates infecting humans and chicken, suggesting a common underlying population of C. jejuni. We
further identify regions that frequently differ between isolates, including both previously described
and novel regions. Finally, we show that genes that belong to certain functional groups differ
between isolates more often than expected by chance.
Conclusion: In this study we demonstrated the utility of 70-mer oligonucleotide microarrays for
genotyping of Campylobacter jejuni isolates, with resolution outperforming MLST.

Background
Campylobacter jejuni is a major cause of human bacterial
gastroenteritis in industrialized countries [1]. Infection
commonly results in self-limiting gastroenteritis but
sequelae may occur, for instance in the form of the Guillain-Barré syndrome causing peripheral neuropathy [2].
The genus Campylobacter is widespread in the environment and constitutes part of the normal flora of birds, cat-

tle and swine. Although there are gaps in our knowledge
of the sources of infection, the handling and consumption
of chicken meat are considered important routes of transmission [3,4].
Cases of campylobacteriosis are mainly sporadic but outbreaks do occur, predominantly through contaminated
milk and untreated water [5]. Due to the sporadic nature

of campylobacter infections, it has proven hard to discern
the epidemiological characteristics of the disease. Robust
and reproducible typing methods are needed to this end,
and a multitude of genotypic methods are now complementing serotyping and other traditional phenotypic
methods (for a review, see [6]). Among these, pulsed-field
gel electrophoresis (PFGE) possess high discriminatory
power and is widely used for studies of strain relatedness
[7-11]. However, PFGE requires strict adherence to standardized protocols, and produces data in the form of band
patterns of restriction endonuclease digested fragments
which are not readily compared between laboratories.
Errors or ambiguities in the assignment of bands may also
occur [12,13].
A multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme assesses
genetic differences by nucleotide sequence determination
of approximately 500 bases in each of seven loci [14]. The
strain discriminatory performance is highly dependent on
the screened loci, which are selected to represent slowly
evolving genes under stabilizing selection pressure, supposedly unaffected by antigen variation or genomic rearrangements. Each allele is assigned a number based on
sequences in the MLST database [15]. Thus, each isolate is
described by a seven-digit sequence type (ST), which is
further grouped according to lineage into clonal complexes, defined as groups of isolates with identical alleles
at ≥4 loci. The MLST scheme has been used in studies of
the population structure of clinical and veterinary isolates
of C. jejuni [10,16-18]. The discriminatory power was
comparable to that of multilocus enzyme electrophoresis
[10], and amplified fragment length polymorphism [18],
but did not reach that of PFGE in a study of epidemiologically related isolates [19].
Comparative genomic hybridizations (CGH) using
genome-wide DNA microarrays have proven useful in
studies of intraspecies diversity for a number of bacterial
species [20-23]. Determination of the full genome
sequence of C. jejuni strain NCTC 11168 [24] allowed
construction of microarrays for studies of the genetic relationship between campylobacter. Using strain NCTC
11168 as reference, several studies have demonstrated a
high degree of intraspecies variability concentrated to
defined genomic regions, particularly affecting loci coding
for lipooligosaccharides, flagellar modification, and DNA
restriction-modification systems [25-31]. CGH may also
elucidate sources of infection, transmission routes and virulence of bacteria [31,32].
Few studies have exploited the power of CGH to evaluate
the accuracy and resolution of present genotyping technologies. In the current study we used a whole-genome
microarray to study C. jejuni isolates typed with PFGE. We
studied closely related pairs of chicken and human iso-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/73

lates, which clustered together in the PFGE analysis, with
the aim to dissect the true genetic relationship within and
between the pairs. The CGH data in this study were generated using an oligonucleotide array, which was evaluated
for its ability to discriminate between present and absent
or divergent genes. The results were further compared
with MLST results to evaluate the genotyping resolution of
the different methods.

Results
Multilocus sequence typing
The twelve isolates representing five distinct PFGE genotypes were analyzed using MLST [14]. Three different STs
belonging to three clonal complexes were found among
the isolates (Figure 1). Human and chicken isolates of the
same PFGE genotype also had the same ST. All isolates
within each ST shared the alleles in all seven loci investigated (data not shown).
Microarray-based genotyping
On average 1,477 non-redundant probes (92%: range
from 1,408 to 1,499) remained after the data preprocessing step and generated a valid log2 ratio (M-value). Several
of the excluded probes had low signal intensities in both
channels and represented probes that failed during array
production. To estimate the noise level associated with
the experiment and to define M-value thresholds for
sequence divergence, we analyzed the M-value distribution of two self-self hybridizations of reference strain
DNA prepared at two separate occasions (Figure 2A). As
expected for a data set with low technical noise, these
hybridizations had narrow M-value distributions (sd =
0.17 and 0.14). Only a few probes had absolute M-values
of >0.5 (5 probes (0.3%) for the first hybridization, and
22 (1.3%) for the second hybridization). One single
probe (0.06%) in the second hybridization had an absolute M-value of >0.75.

Next, a comparison between the sequenced strains NCTC
11168 and RM1221 allowed for estimation of the effect of
sequence divergence on the M-values. We used sequence
similarity searches to match each probe with the genome
sequence of the RM1221 strain and to calculate the
number of matching nucleotides (all probes have a 100%
match in the genome of NCTC 11168). There were in total
160 probes (10%) with less than 55 matching bases, putatively measuring highly divergent genes or genomic
regions absent in RM1221. Approximately 51% (811/
1,601) of the probes had a perfect match in RM1221,
while 21% (336/1,601) had a one-base mismatch. A
reduction in the number of matching bases displayed a
strong association with reduced hybridization signals,
and hence a trend towards lower M-values in the comparison between RM1221 and NCTC 11168 (Figure 2B, Table
1). Interestingly, already a one-base divergence resulted in

(shift of mean value from 0.02 to -0.12; p < 10-16, onesided, two-sample t-test).
We further used the RM1221 vs. NCTC 11168 hybridization data to define an M-value threshold for detection of
divergent genes. The effect of M-value threshold on sensitivity and specificity for detection of probes with at least
one, two, three or four mismatches to the reference strain
was plotted (Figure 3). We used this information, in coma

bination with the self-self hybridization data, to define a
conservative M-value threshold of less than -0.75 for
divergent or absent genes. At this stringency level, none of
the probes with a perfect match in the RM1221 genome
were erroneously identified as divergent in comparison
with NCTC 11168. On the other hand, using this M-value
cutoff only 32% of the probes with ≥1 mismatch could be
detected as divergent (Figure 3A). The fraction of correctly
identified divergent probes increased to 93% when the
analysis was restricted to probes with at least four mis-

matches (94% sequence identity, Figure 3D). Collectively,
the analyses indicate that the oligonucleotide platform
does not permit reliable genotyping at the single-base
level, but can with high confidence be used to identify
absent or divergent genes (≥4 mismatches, i.e. sequence
identity ≤94%). At this level the probability of false-positives is low and the sensitivity to detect ≥ 4-bp mismatches
is high (>93%), providing a reasonable balance between
false positives and false negatives.
The isolates included in the study showed large differences in the number of probes (range from 30 to 420) that
were sequence divergent compared to the reference strain.
In total 29% (439/1,527) and 17% (253/1,527) of the
probes were variable in more than two and three of the
studied isolates, respectively. These numbers are in line
with previous CGH studies [25-31]. The variable probes
represented genes distributed over the entire chromosome, and showed some local clustering (Figure 2C).
Probes exhibiting M-values of >0.75 were classified as representing genes with higher copy numbers in the test isolate compared to the reference strain NCTC 11168. Genes
with higher copy numbers were detected in five of the test
isolates (three genes in C12, one in C36, nine in H467, six
in C20, and two in H312). In isolates C12 and C20 two
consecutive genes with higher copy numbers could be
detected (C12: Cj0078c and Cj0079c, C20: Cj0967 and
Cj0968, and Cj1419c and Cj1420c). The M-values for all
probes are available through the ArrayExpress data repository (accession number E-TABM-460).
Clustering and correlation of the different typing methods
We next carried out a hierarchical clustering analysis using
the microarray data to identify similarities among the isolates. The origin of the isolates (chicken or human) had
no effect on the clustering. Instead, the isolates clustered
into groups similar to those obtained by PFGE and MLST.
Three major clusters were identified (Figure 4A). The first
included all isolates with PFGE types A, B and C, belonging to the MLST ST-21 clonal complex. Within this cluster,
the two isolates of PFGE type B clustered together, while

another cluster was formed by the two type C and three
type A isolates. The remaining type A isolate clustered outside this tight cluster. The microarray data indicated that
this cluster of isolates is similar to the reference strain
NCTC 11168 (Figure 4A). This relatedness is further supported by the MLST data; strain NCTC 11168 belongs to
the same clonal complex as the type A, B and C isolates
(ST-21 clonal complex), although it is of a different
sequence type (ST-43). The second cluster included PFGE
type D isolates (MLST clonal complex ST-677) and strain
RM1221, and the third PFGE type H isolates (MLST clonal
complex ST-48).
Identification of variable regions
Previous CGH studies of C. jejuni have identified 18
genomic regions enriched for genes with diverging
sequences [27,29]. We analyzed the presence of variable
genes in the five groups of isolates (A, B, C, D and H)
defined by PFGE and microarray clustering. A region was
confirmed variable if the calculated average M-value of the
group was <-0.75 for at least one of the probes in the
region. Using this approach, we noted that all of the previously identified variable regions differed in at least one
of the five isolate groups, and further that four variable
regions (regions 1, 9, 12 and 13) showed divergence in all
five groups (Figure 4B). Also region 11 was highly variable, with four isolate groups showing variability in the
region. We further mined our data for additional regions
that showed variability in multiple isolates. We found
three additional regions, spanning genes Cj0137–Cj0145
(region 19), Cj0356c-Cj0360 (region 20) and Cj1047cCj1069 (region 21).
Identification of COG groups enriched for variable regions
We further used the Clusters of Orthologous Groups of
proteins (COG) database [33] to analyze the functional
group assignments of the variable genes (M-values of <0.75 for the corresponding probes). In all isolates genes
from multiple COG categories were found variable, indicating that sequence divergence is not restricted to genes
encoding specific functions (Figure 4C). Furthermore,

reference strain NCTC 11168.

using Fisher exact test we identified a significant overrepresentation of divergent genes in the COG category M (cell
wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis) and V (defense
mechanisms) in several of the isolates (Figure 4D). A
strong enrichment of the same categories was observed
when the analysis was restricted to genes with high
sequence divergence (i.e., M-values of <-2.0). However,
when the analysis was carried out using genes with moderate sequence divergence (M-values between -2.0 and 0.75), no significant enrichment of COG categories could
be observed. These results suggest that the moderate
sequence divergence reflects normal interstrain variability
unlikely to affect protein function in any substantial way.
Furthermore, the probes with moderate sequence diver-

gence seem to be distributed over the entire length of the
chromosome, while the probes with high sequence divergence seem to be more tightly clustered (Figure 2C).

Discussion
In this study we evaluated three different methods for
analysis of the genomic content of closely-related C. jejuni
isolates from chicken and humans. The methods tested
were CGH using oligonucleotide microarrays, and genotyping by PFGE and by MLST. We first analyzed six pairs
of human and chicken isolates which were clustered based
on PFGE of KpnI digests. Cluster analysis based on CGH
data yielded an identical grouping, with the exception of
one isolate. Thus PFGE, which may appear a relatively

Analysis 4 variable regions in the C. jejuni genome
Analysis of variable regions in the C. jejuni genome. (A) Hierarchical clustering (Euclidian distance, average linking) based on the entire
CGH dataset. The probes are ordered according to their position in the genome, starting with the probe targeting gene Cj0001 at the
bottom of the figure. The log2 ratio (M-values) of each probe is represented using a color gradient from yellow to blue, denoting M-values
ranging from 0 to -7. A negative M-value indicates that the probe shows sequence divergence or absence in the test isolate compared to
the NCTC 11168 reference strain. The PFGE genotypes and MLST sequence types are shown below. (B) Presence of variable regions in
the analyzed isolates. On the y-axis are the five types of isolates (A, B, C, D and H) included in the study. The height of the bars corresponds to the number of isolate types in which the variable region was identified. The width of each bar is drawn proportional to the
number of genes in the corresponding variable region. Regions 1–16 were described by Taboada et al. [27] and regions 17–18 by Parker
et al. [29]. Regions 19–21 were identified in this study. (C) Analysis of the divergent genes shows that these represent multiple COG
groups, as exemplified for isolate C20. Description of the COG groups is available through the COG database [33]. (D) The representation of COG groups among the variable genes was analyzed using Fisher exact test and the results are summarized using color coding.
Groups M and V were significantly overrepresented among the variable genes in multiple isolates.

crude method, produced a phylogenetic tree which coincided well with the one produced by genomic probing
through CGH. The data further suggests that there are no
genetic markers distinguishing the human from the
chicken isolates included in this study. The isolates were
subtyped using a previously described MLST scheme [14].
MLST defined three genotypes among the twelve isolates,
compared to five defined by PFGE. All eight isolates with
PFGE genotypes A (n = 4), B (2) and C (2) were found to
belong to sequence type 21. The ST-21 complex has previously been shown to be abundant among isolates from a
wide variety of sources [14,16-19]. The two PFGE genotype D isolates were assigned to ST-48, a sequence type
differing from ST-21 in three of the seven loci. Thus, our
results suggest that a combined approach using MLST in
combination with a second method is necessary to reach
a sufficient discriminatory power, at least for resolving
epidemiological relationships on a shorter time scale. This
conclusion is supported by previous studies [11,34].
Using the microarray data, we have shown that several
previously identified regions [27,29] are also divergent in
isolates investigated in this study. These include regions
that are known to be important modulators of the surfaceexposed antigenic proteins (e.g., contain genes encoding
flagella proteins). In the present study we identified additional regions that are divergent between the isolates,
which suggests that additional genome-wide studies are
required to fully characterize the variability of the C. jejuni
genome. A functional analysis of the variable genes
showed that modulation of the surface exposed structures
is important for creating variability in the C. jejuni isolates, possibly providing means for avoidance of the host's
immune system.
As far as we are aware, this is the first study where a
genome-wide oligonucleotide array is used for CGHbased genotyping of C. jejuni. Previous studies have used
microarrays based on polymerase chain reaction-amplified probes for analysis of different C. jejuni isolates [2531]. The main advantage associated with the use of oligonucleotide arrays is the avoidance of extensive crosshybridization with other regions of the genome and an
improved specificity and resolution, allowing detection of
smaller differences between the isolates. Also, the design
of the probes can be carried out to ensure approximately
equal optimal hybridization conditions, avoiding
sequence-specific bias in the hybridization signals. However, there are limitations with the oligonucleotide-based
CGH platform. The array probes are targeted towards coding regions of the C. jejuni genome, which does not allow
for detection of divergence in intergenic regions. Although
more specific, the oligonucleotide probes do not allow for
detection of single-base changes and lack the possibility to
detect short deletions and changes in gene synteny. Also,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/73

sequence divergence affecting a non-targeted region of a
gene will remain undetected using the oligonucleotide
probe approach, suggesting that the true differences
between the isolates may be even stronger than reported
here. As with all microarrays, the analysis is limited to
genes represented on the microarray, in this case genes
present in strain NCTC 11168. The design could be
improved by adding probes representing genes from other
sequenced C. jejuni genomes.

Conclusion
In this study we have investigated the variability of closely
related C. jejuni isolates. The comparative genomics
hybridization data did not affect the PFGE-based clustering, with the exeption of one isolate which was removed
from the fork containing the remaining isolates of the
same PFGE type. Nor did we identify any markers predictive of source (human or chicken). We have further shown
that MLST-based genotyping needs to be complemented
with other methods to achieve similar resolution as is
obtained with the other genotyping approaches. We have
also demonstrated that extensive variability between isolates is not restricted to the previously identified regions.
Finally, certain functional groups (COG groups M and V)
show significant enrichment among the variable genes.
Collectively, these results demonstrate the importance of
unbiased, genome-wide approaches in analysis of differences between isolates of C. jejuni. This will facilitate our
future understanding of parameters governing the pathogenic potential of various isolates and allow the design of
relevant tools for assessing the genetic diversity and epidemiology of C. jejuni.

Methods
Campylobacter isolates and extraction of genomic DNA
Campylobacter spp. isolates (n = 90) were collected from all
reported cases of domestically acquired campylobacteriosis in four Swedish regions within the scope of a study
conducted in July through October 2003. During the
same time period and in the same geographical areas,
fresh poultry products from retail were purchased and
analyzed for campylobacter. Isolates from both patients
and poultry were species identified by polymerase chain
reaction [35] and the C. jejuni isolates subtyped using
PFGE and the restriction enzyme SmaI as earlier described
[7]. Isolates sharing PFGE genotype with at least one other
isolate were further PFGE-genotyped using the restriction
enzyme KpnI. Each unique banding pattern was assigned
an identifying letter. For the current study, six pairs of C.
jejuni isolates with identical SmaI and KpnI genotypes
were selected to represent each of the KpnI genotypes A
(two pairs), B, C, D and H (Figure 1). Each pair consisted
of one chicken and one human isolate originating from
the same geographical region. The two completely

sequenced strains NCTC 11168 [24] and RM1221 [36]
were also included.
All isolates were cultured on blood agar plates at 37°C for
48 h in a microaerophilic environment. Genomic DNA
for MLST and microarray analyses was extracted using the
DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
Multilocus sequence typing
The seven loci used in the MLST [14] were polymerase
chain reaction amplified using primers and conditions
according to the C. jejuni MLST website http://
pubmlst.org/campylobacter. Nucleotide sequences were
obtained by sequencing of both strands using the BigDye
Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit and a 3130xl
Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA).
Sequences were assigned allele numbers, and the
sequence type (ST) and lineage (clonal complex) of each
isolate was determined by interrogating the MLST database.
Comparative genomic hybridizations
Campylobacter jejuni AROS v1.0 oligonucleotide probe set
was purchased from Operon Biotechnologies (Cologne,
Germany). The set consisted of 70-mer oligonucleotides
representing 1,546 open reading frames (ORFs) from
strain NCTC 11168, 51 ORFs from the virulence plasmid
pVir from strain 81–176, and 4 ORFs from plasmid pCJ01
from strain 21190. The oligonucleotides were printed in
triplicates on CodeLink Activated slides (GE Healthcare,
Uppsala, Sweden) and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For probe annotation the version
1.3.2 (dated May 16, 2007) of the OMAD database [37]
was used. Additional details on the microarray production
are available through the ArrayExpress microarray data
repository (accession number A-MEXP-925) [38].

Test DNA extracted from the twelve C. jejuni isolates was
co-hybridized with reference DNA extracted from strain
NCTC 11168 in one hybridization per isolate. Additional
hybridizations were performed to compare strains NCTC
11168 and RM1221, and to compare two separate target
preparations (culturing, DNA extraction, labeling and
hybridization) of the NCTC 11168 strain to establish the
magnitude of technical noise in the experimental setup.
Both sets of additional hybridizations were carried out in
a dye-swap manner.
For labeling, 3 μg genomic DNA in 21 μL water was sonicated for 30 s. Fluorescent Cy3 or Cy5 dyes were incorporated in a mixture of 15 μg random octamers, 40 U of
Klenow enzyme (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), 6 nmol of each
dATP, dGTP and dCTP, 3 nmol dUTP, and 50 nmol Cy3/Cy5-dUTP (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) in 1 mM
Tris pH 8.0, 100 μM EDTA. The mixture was incubated at

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/8/73

37°C for 2 h after which 5 μL 0.5 M EDTA was added.
Unincorporated dye was removed using the Microcon-30
columns (Millipore AB, Solna, Sweden) and the dye
incorporation efficiency measured using a Nanodrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Rockland, USA).
Reference DNA was combined with an equal amount of
reciprocally labeled test DNA, dried down using a speed
vac, resuspended in 100 μL hybridization buffer (5 × SSC,
50% formamide, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 μg/μL tRNA), and denatured for 2 min at 95°C. The samples were cooled on ice,
transferred to the microarrays and hybridized for 16 h at
42°C. The arrays were then washed once for 5 min with 2
× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42°C, once for 5 min with 0.1 × SSC,
0.1% SDS at room temperature, and four times for one
minute with 0.1 × SSC at room temperature. All washing
steps were done under agitation. The slides were dried by
brief centrifugation at low speed.
The microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000B
scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, USA). Features
were identified and fluorescence intensities extracted
using the irregular feature-finding approach implemented
in GenePix Pro 5.1 (Molecular Devices). Further analysis
was carried out in the R environment for statistical computing [39] using the aroma [40], Bioconductor [41] and
kth-packages [42]. No subtraction of the local background
was carried out, as this was found to slightly increase the
variability between replicated features. A feature was considered unreliable and removed if: a) the feature contained less than 55 pixels, or if for both channels b) 10%
or more of the pixels were below the signal intensity of the
local background plus two standard deviations of the
background, c) the signal-to-noise ratio was below 3, d)
the signal was saturated, or e) the intensity was below the
mean signal of negative controls (probes with random
sequence). The design of the probe set is based on the
genome sequence of the NCTC 11168 strain, and hence
absent or sequence divergent genes in the test isolate
(labeled in Cy5) compared to the reference strain (Cy3)
show negative log2 (Cy5/Cy3) ratio values (M-values).
Data normalization was carried out in a block-wise manner assuming equal sums of the two channels using a nondivergent set of probes. These probes were obtained after
removal of 20% of the probes with the most negative Mvalues. After normalization, replicates of each probe were
averaged, discarding probes that had only one available
measurement. The microarray dataset is available through
ArrayExpress (accession number E-TABM-460) [38].
