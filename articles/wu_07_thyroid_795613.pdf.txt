Abstract
Background: Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) function as molecular switches in response to
thyroid hormone to regulate gene transcription. TRs were previously believed to be present only
in chordates.
Results: We isolated two TR genes from the Schistosoma mansoni and identified TR orthologues
from other invertebrates: the platyhelminths, S. japonium and Schmidtea mediterranea, the mollusc,
Lottia gigantean and the arthropod Daphnia pulex. Phylogenetic analysis of the DNA binding domain
and/or ligand binding domain shows that invertebrate and vertebrate TRs cluster together, TRs
from the vertebrates and from the jawless vertebrate (lamprey) clustered within separate
subgroups, Platyhelminth TRs cluster outside of the vertebrate TR subgroups and that the
schistosome TRs and S. mediterranea TRs clustered within separate subgroups.
Alignment of the C-terminus of the A/B domain revealed a conserved TR-specific motif, termed
TR 'N-terminus signature sequence', with a consensus sequence of (G/P)YIPSY(M/L)XXXGPE(D/
E)X.
Heterodimer formation between S. mansoni TRs and SmRXR1 suggests that the invertebrate TR
protein gained the ability to form a heterodimer with RXR. ESMA analysis showed that SmTRα
could bind to a conserved DNA core motif as a monomer or homodimer.
Conclusion: Vertebrate TR genes originated from a common ancestor of the Bilateria. TR genes
underwent duplication independently in the Protostomia and Deuterostomia. The duplication of
TRs in deuterostomes occurred after the split of jawless and jawed vertebrates. In protostomes,
TR genes underwent duplication in Platyhelminths, occurring independently in trematode and
turbellarian lineages. Using S. mansoni TRs as an example, invertebrate TRs exhibited the ability to
form a dimer with RXR prior to the emergence of the vertebrate TRs and were able to bind to
vertebrate TR core DNA elements as a monomer or homodimer.

Background
Thyroid hormones (TH) play important roles in growth,
development and metabolism in vertebrates. TH is synthesized in the thyroid gland under the control of thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH) secreted by the pituitary. TSH
secretion is controlled by thyrotropin-releasing hormone
(TRH) which is secreted from the hypothalamus. THs are
lipophilic molecules able to passively cross the membrane
and bind to its receptor, the thyroid hormone receptor
(TR). TRs belong to a superfamily of transcription factors
called nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily, based on protein sequence similarities, structural motifs and functionality [1]. TRs function as a molecular switch in response to
the thyroid hormones T3 or T4 to activate or repress gene
transcription depending on the promoter context and thyroid hormone binding status [2]. The typical nuclear
receptor contains an N-terminal A/B domain, a conserved
C domain (DNA binding domain, DBD), a D domain
(hinge region) and a moderately conserved E domain (ligand binding domain, LBD). The most conserved DBD
contains two zinc finger motifs (CI and CII). Like all NRs,
TRs regulate transcription through its binding to the promoter region of a target gene by the DBD and they activate
or repress mRNA synthesis through co-regulators bound
to the LBD [1]. The specific target DNA sequence to which
NRs bind is called a hormone response element (HRE).
The typical HRE is a direct, inverted or everted repeat or
palindrome of the DNA sequence AGGTCA. TRs can bind
to the HRE as a monomer, a homodimer or as a heterodimer with RXR, another member of nuclear receptor
superfamily which contributes to the specificity of the TR.
TH binds to the LBD of TR which results in a conformational change in the C-terminus of the receptor. Corepressors then dissociated from the TR allowing coactivators to
bind to the C-terminus of the TR in a hormone-dependent
manner. TR and the coactivator complex activate the
expression of the target gene [3,4].
TR was previously believed to be an innovation of chordates as the genomes of insects (Drosophila and mosquito) and nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans and C.
briggus) do not contain TR genes [5-8]. Recently, we identified two thyroid receptor homologues in the flatworm
Schistosoma mansoni [9], one of which was found in the S.
mansoni EST database [6,10]. The presence of TR homologues in S. mansoni demonstrated that the TR orthologue
genes are present outside of chordates. However, it is still
unclear whether these prostostome TRs possess the same
functional domains as in vertebrate TRs. Another question
is whether the TR orthologue is present in other invertebrates or just in the platyhelminth lineage? Answers to
these questions will help to understand the origin of TR
genes and evolution of the function of vertebrate thyroid
hormone network. To begin to address these questions,
we isolated cDNAs of S. mansoni TRs and demonstrated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/150

that TRs in platyhelminths are highly conserved not only
in sequence similarity, but also in gene organization, protein-protein interaction and in DNA-binding ability. Furthermore, we mined the available genome data and
demonstrated that TR orthologues are present in different
invertebrate animals but not in Porifera or Cnidaria. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the TR orthologue likely
originated from a common ancestor of the Bilateria.

Results
TR orthologue genes in invertebrate animals
By an extensive search of available databases, predicted
genes encoding TR orthologues were found in different
invertebrate animals using the conserved DBD as a query.
They include two genes in each of the platyhelminth species evaluated, the turbellarian Schmidtea mediterranea and
the trematodes, Schistosoma mansoni and S. japonium, one
each from the mollusc Lottia gigantean (owl limpet) and
the crustacean Daphnia pulex (water flea) (Fig. 1 and see
additional file 1). No TR orthologues were identified in
any species of the Radiata.
Sequence alignment analysis
Alignment of DBD amino acid sequences show that the
invertebrate TR orthologues are highly conserved (Fig. 1).
All TRs (from chordate and non-chordate species) possess
an identical P-box sequence, which determines the specificity of target DNA binding. The methionine at position
16 of the N-terminus of the DBD (highlighted in red in
Fig. 1) was non-chordate TR-specific. Instead at this position an isoleucine is conserved in all chordate TRs examined to date. Two amino acids (His and Pro) at positions
33–34 of N-terminal of DBD were chordate TR-specific
(highlighted blue in Fig. 1). The second zinc finger is less
conserved in non-chordate TR orthologues compared to
the first zinc finger, but still shows a high degree of conservation (Fig. 1). The T-box and A-box which are located
in the C-terminal extension (CTE) of the DBD are also
highly conserved in non-chordate TR orthologues. They
show 75–83% and 57–100% identity to the chordate Tbox and A-box, respectively. These regions in the water
flea TR orthologue are highly divergent, probably due to a
recombination event that happened in this region (see
below). An aspartic acid in the vertebrate TRs at the 8th
position of N-terminus of the T-box is highly conserved
for jawed vertebrate TRs, a glutamic acid at this position is
conserved in other TRs. Although the N-terminal A/B
domain of nuclear receptors is divergent, there is a highly
conserved motif found at the 3' end of the TR A/B domain,
we termed the 'N-terminal signature sequence' (NTSS).
The TR NTSS is a consensus sequence of (G/P)YIPSY(M/
L)XXXGPE(D/E) (Fig. 1). In non-chordate TR orthologues, the sequence is PYIPSYMXXXGPEEP; while in
chordates, three amino acids are deleted generating a
sequence of GYIPYL(D/E)KE(P/Q/L). The deleted three

Sequence alignment of the DNA binding domain (DBD) of TRs
Sequence alignment of the DNA binding domain (DBD) of TRs. There is a highly conserved motif found at the 3' end
of A/B domain, termed the 'N-terminal signature sequence' (NTSS). In non-chordate TR homologues, it is PYIPSYMXXXGPEEP; while in chordate NTSS, three amino acids are deleted (represented by dashes) generating a sequence of GYIPYL(D/
E)KE(P/Q/L). In the N-terminus of the DBD, a methionine at position 16 (highlighted in red) is non-chordate TR specific. In this
position an isoleucine is conserved for all chordate TRs. Two amino acids (His and Pro for all species except Ciona) are
inserted at positions 33–34 of the N-terminus of DBD in chordate TRs (highlighted in blue). An aspartic acid in vertebrate TRs
at the 8th position of the T-box is highly conserved for vertebrate TRs, a glutamic acid at this position is conserved for other
TRs (highlighted in red). Stars identify the conserved cysteine residues that comprise the zinc finger of the DBD. The conserved residues are highlighted in green. CiTR: Ciona intestinalis nuclear receptor 1, DpTR: water flea Daphnia pulex TR, hTRa:

amino acids in chordate NTSS were deduced from the
non-chordate sea urchin TR (SpTR). Since the deuterostome SpTR shares the same NTSS with that of protostome
TRs, this suggests that the non-chordate NTSS is the primitive state.
Functional domains of non-chordate TRs
To determine the functional domains of a non-chordate
TR orthologue, cDNAs encoding the entire open reading
frame (ORF) of the two S. mansoni TRs (SmTRα and
SmTRβ) were isolated, sequenced and the sequences
deposited in GenBank (SmTRα [GenBank:AY395038,
AY395059–AY395063, AH013464) and SmTRβ [GenBank:AY395039]).

SmTRα and SmTRβ encode proteins of 1115 amino acids
and 847 amino acids, respectively. Each protein exhibits a
modular structure characteristic of the nuclear receptor
superfamily with an A/B domain, a conserved DBD, a
hinge region and a LBD (Fig. 2 and 3). Alignment of the
sequences demonstrated that the LBD is less conserved.
Helices 1–2 in the LBD are highly divergent, similar to
that of other reported schistosome NRs [11-19]. Although
the LBD is less conserved (Fig. 2), the consensus motif I
(from helix 3 to helix 6) and the consensus motif II (from
the middle of helix 8 to the middle of helix 10) are conserved [20] (Fig. 2). A putative AF2 activation domain core
(AF2-AD) (helix 12) is present in both SmTRs (Fig. 2). It
exhibits a high degree of conservation (represented by
YLHELF and YFHELF in SmTRα and SmTRβ, respectively)
in comparison to the common consensus AF2-AD core
structure of ΦΦXEΦΦ, where Φ denotes a hydrophobic
residue [12,21,22].
The two consensus LBD motifs (motif I and motif II) were
examined in other non-chordate TR orthologues when
their DBD-containing contig contained these regions (Fig.
4). Two amino acids in motif I (a glycine at position 21
and an aspartic acid at position 29) and the three amino
acids in motif II (alanine at position 3, a leucine at position 9 and an isoleucine or leucine at postion 45) were
found to be invertebrate TR-specific (Fig. 4).
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analysis of DBD sequences shows that all
invertebrate TRs cluster with the vertebrate TR subgroup
(Fig. 5), suggesting that they originated from a common
ancestor gene. The two TR orthologues in the Platyhelminths, the turbellarian S. mediterranea and the trematodes (S. mansoni and S. japonicum) clustered outside of
the vertebrate TR subgroups suggesting that they underwent duplication after the split of Prostostomia and Deuterostomia. Furthermore, each of the two duplicated
trematode TR homologues cluster together within a subgroup, while the two turbellarian (S. mediterranea) TR

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/150

homologues clustered within another subgroup. This
result suggests that the TR duplication in the Platyhelminths occurred after the split of the trematodes and
the turbellarians.
A high resolution phylogenetic tree was constructed using
the DBD and LBD sequences (Fig. 6). Since the only full
length LBD sequence was identified from S. mansoni TRs,
the S. mansoni TRs were used to represent the protostome
TRs. The results show that all jawed vertebrate TRs clustered within a group including TRα and TRβ subgroups.
The two jawless vertebrate lamprey TRs clustered outside
of the jawed vertebrate TRs. This suggests that the vertebrate TR gene underwent duplication after the split of jawless and jawed vertebrates. The urochordate Ciona TR and
the two duplicated trematode SmTRs cluster outside of the
vertebrate TR groups. These results confirmed those
obtained from the DBD analysis which suggested that the
TR gene duplication occurred independently in vertebrates and invertebrates.
Genomic organization
The gene organization of the TR homologue genes in S.
mansoni (SmTRα and SmTRβ) was identified by alignment
of the cDNA sequence with the genomic sequence (Fig. 3).
The genomic sequences were obtained by screening S.
mansoni bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries
(SmBAC1 or CHOR103) and sequencing the BAC DNA
[23], and by Blast searching WTSI S. mansoni WGS database [24]. Three clones (SmBAC1 3A6, 4G3 and 9D10) for
SmTRα and 3 clones (CHOR103 3I15, 7K22 and 21F18)
for SmTRβ were identified by screening the BAC libraries.
A gDNA contig (Sm00.scaff00056.0030.1) for SmTRα and
a gDNA contig (Sm00.scaff00631.0050) for SmTRβ were
obtained from WTSI S. mansoni WGS database. The Contig Sm00.scaff00056.0030.1 contains a partial coding
region for SmTRα, BAC DNAs (SmBAC1 3A6 and 4G3)
were sequenced to generate a contig which contained full
coverage of SmTRα cDNA sequence.

The ORF of SmTRα is encoded by seven exons spanning
over 32 kb and the ORF of SmTRβ is encoded by six exons
spanning over 21 kb (Fig. 3). All splice donor and acceptor sites for the two genes fit the GT-AG role. The A/B
domain, hinge and E domains (LBD) are each encoded by
2–3 exons, respectively. The DBD of both proteins is
encoded by one exon (Fig. 3). The 5' UTR and 3'UTR in
both SmTRα and SmTRβ were not determined due to a
short 3'UTR in SmTRα which seems not to be full length
and due to the genomic contig not covering the 5'- and
3'UTR for SmTRβ.
It is known that there are four conserved splice junctions
in nuclear receptor genes [3,4,9,20]. The first conserved
junction position (JP1) is within the DBD encoding

region, the second (JP2) is in the region which encodes
the 3' end of the DBD, the third (JP3) is in the LBD motif
I (also known as the LBD signature sequence, Tτ) encoding region [20] and the fourth one (JP4) is in the LBD
motif II encoding region [20]. JP1 exhibits diversity
among nuclear receptor genes but is conserved for certain
gene groups including vertebrate TR genes [9]. JP2 is
highly conserved usually in the region encoding the
fourth amino acid of the hinge region, but most of the
Drosophila NR genes have lost this junction [9]. JP3 is NR
gene-specific [20] and JP4 is at the same position in all
vertebrate NR genes [20]. All identified non-chordate TR
orthologues possess the four JPs, except JP1 was lost in the
schistsome TR genes (SmTRα, SmTRβ, SjTRα and SjTRβ)
and JP2 was lost in DpTR. JP3 of all invertebrate TR genes
is at the same position as that found in vertebrate TR genes
(NR1A) (Fig. 7). JP4 in all invertebrate TRs is located at
the same conserved position as found in all analyzed NRs
[20]. The conserved splice junctions in these invertebrate
TRs suggest that the organization of the TR genes was
ancient and has been maintained throughout evolution. It
adds further support to the notion that vertebrate and
invertebrate TR orthologues originated from a common
ancestor gene.

Protein-protein interaction
One property of vertebrate TRs is the ability to form a heterodimer with RXR [4]. To determine if a non-chordate TR
would form a heterodimer with RXR, the interaction
between SmRXR1 with SmTRα and SmTRβ was tested by
GST pull-down experiments. Either GST-SmTRα-LBD or
GST-SmTRβ-LBD fusion protein was incubated with in
vitro translated 35S-SmRXR1. GST-bound resin was used as
a negative control to assess non-specific background binding. The results showed that both SmTRα-LBD and
SmTRβ-LBD could form a heterodimer with SmRXR1 in
vitro. The results demonstrate that non-chordate TRs are
capable of forming a heterodimer with RXR (Fig. 8).

Electrphoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed to determine DNA binding specificity of SmTRα
and SmTRβ. A DNA element containing the half-site
AGGTCA, a direct repeat of the half-site spaced with 0–5
nucleic acids (DR0-DR5) and palindrome repeat of the
half-site not separated by nucleic acids (Pal0) were
employed. A gel shift was observed when γ-32P labelled
half-site, DR0-DR5 or Pal0 were added to SmTRα. SmTRα
could bind to all the tested oligonucleotides either as a
monomer or as a homodimer (Fig. 9A). SmTRβ demon-

strated a weak gel shift with the same labelled oligonucleotides as template (Fig. 9B). Heterodimers of either
SmTRα or SmTRβ with SmRXR1 did not cause a gel shift
(Fig. 9A and 9B). SmRXR1 alone could bind to the tested
oligonucleotides (Fig. 9A and 9B) as we previously demonstrated [19].
The above result showed that SmTRα could bind to a half
site, DR0-DR5 and Pal0 element as a monomer or a
homodimer. To test whether the DBD domain (which
contains a weaker-dimer interface in the D-box) could

bind to the oligonucleotides as a homodimer, in vitro synthesized SmTRα (Gln182-Ala288) (containing 20 aa at the
5' end of the DBD, the DBD and 40 aa at the 3' end of the
DBD) was tested. SmTRα (Gln182-Ala288) bound to all
tested oligonucleotides as either a monomer or a
homodimer (Fig. 10). The results suggest that there is a
dimer interface located in DBD region of SmTRα [25-27].
Specificity was demonstrated by the ability of cold specific
competitor but not the non-specific competitor to prevent
SmTRα binding to the oligonucleotide template.

Protein-protein interaction of SmTRs with SmRXR1.
GST pull down shows that both SmTRα and SmTRβ can
form a heterodimer with SmRXR1 in vitro. 35S-labeled
SmRXR1 was synthesized in vitro using pCITE-SmRXR1 as
template and then incubated with GST-SmTRα(LBD), GSTSmTRβ(LBD) or GST (negative control) protein affixed to
glutathione-Sepharose beads. The beads were collected,
washed and the bound protein was resolved on 10% SDS
acrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography.

Discussion
An extensive search of whole genomic sequence (WGS)
databases extracted from NCBI and online resources
revealed the presence of TR orthologues in the Platyhelminths, Mollusca, Crustacea, and Echinodermata.
However, no TR orthologues nor sequences encoding a TR
P-box sequence of CEGCKG followed by the amino acid
sequence FFRR (CEGCKGFFRR), which is unique to NR
subfamily 1 including TR, was found in sponges (Reniera
sp) nor cnidarians (Hydra magnipapillata and Nematostella
vectensis). The results suggested that the TR orthologue
gene originated in a common ancestor of the Bilateria.
The gene duplication of TRs was deduced from a phylogenetic analysis employing DBD and LBD sequences. The
analyses demonstrated that the TR orthologue genes
underwent duplication independently in invertebrates
and vertebrates. Furthermore, the TR orthologues in the
Platyhelminths underwent duplication after the split of
the turbellaria and trematodes. In vertebrates, the TR
genes underwent a duplication event in lampreys, a jawless vertebrate, after the lamprey split from a common
ancestor of jawed vertebrates. This result is consistent with
the duplication of Hox gene clusters in lampreys [28].
Although the A/B domain of NR is highly divergent, we
identified a conserved NTSS (N-terminal signature
sequence, (G/P)YIPSY(M/L)XXXGPE(D/E)) located in the
C-terminus of the A/B domain of TRs. Analysis of other
NRs (data not shown) demonstrates this motif is found
only in TRs suggesting it is TR-specific. The NTSS of TRs
was found to be sequence-specific for the chordate and for

the non-chordate TRs, three amino acids present in nonchordate TRs are missing in chordate NTSS. In the DBD, a
methionine at position 16 of the N-terminus was nonchordate-specific, while two amino acids inserted at positions 33–34 of the N-terminus were chordate-specific,
These differences which are conserved, support the notion
that TR genes duplicated independently in non-chordate
and chordate species.
That the JP3 conserved in all invertebrate TRs are also conserved in vertebrate TR genes support the notion that the
vertebrate and invertebrate TR orthologue genes originated from a common ancestor gene. Further, that the
four JPs are conserved in both invertebrate and vertebrate
TR orthologue genes suggest that the gene organization of
vertebrate TR genes is ancient and has been maintained
through out evolution of TRs.
GST pull-down experiments showed that SmTRs exhibits
similarity to vertebrate TR proteins as they both can form
a heterodimer with RXR (SmRXR1). RXRs have been characterized in other invertebrates such as Mollusca and
Arthropoda [29,30]. The formation of SmTRs with
SmRXR1 indicates that other invertebrate TRs can possibly
form a heterodimer with RXR. The ability of vertebrate NR
to bind to a DNA element on a target gene was described
as the 1–2–3–4–5 rule [31,32]. Vertebrate TRs are known
to bind to half-sites as a monomer, to DR0 as a heterodimer with RXR [33] and to DR4 as a homodimer or
heterodimer [32,34-43]. The binding of the TR monomer
or homodimer is weak, which is due to a rapid dissociation of the TR-TRE complex [44]. Our EMSA show that
SmTRα can bind to a half-site as a monomer and bind to
DR0-DR5 as a homodimer. The results suggested that TR
gained the ability to bind to conserved half-site repeats in
a common ancestor, but did not subsequently evolve a
distinct specificity as regards spacing between half sites.
Although the DBD sequence between SmTRα and SmTRβ
are highly similar, SmTRβ showed weak binding to the
DNA elements compared to that of SmTRα. This suggests
that other domains may have a role in determining the
ability of SmTRβ to bind to the DNA element, such as has
been shown for another schistosome nuclear receptor,
SmNR1 [19]. Although both SmTRs could form a heterodimer with SmRXR1 as determined in a GST pulldown assay, SmTRα/SmRXR1 or SmTRβ/SmRXR1 did not
bind to the DNA elements tested. This may due to the
flanking or spacing of nucleotides between the HRE, as it
is known that these nucleotides also determine the ability
of the protein to bind to it. Identification of the HRE in a
target gene will help to understand the evolution of TR
DNA binding properties. Mammalian TRs are liganddependent transcription factors, they repress basal transcription through association with a variety of corepressors in the absence of T3. A structural change occurs when

T3 binds to the TR that results in the release of natural
corepressors and results in the recruitment of coactivators
to activate gene transcription [4]. Determination of
whether invertebrate TR can bind to T3 will help to understand the evolution of the thyroid hormone pathway.

Conclusion
We have identified ortholouges of TR in various invertebrate phyla. Sequence analysis demonstrates that there is
a 'N-terminal signature sequence' (NTSS) located in the A/
B domain -(N-terminal region) specific to TRs. Phylogenetic analysis of conserved DBD sequences showed that
TR orthologues originated from a common ancestor of the
Bilateria which underwent gene duplication independently in the Protostomia and Deuterostomia. Using the
schistosome TR orthologues as representative of the invertebrate TR genes, we have demonstrated that they can
form heterodimers with RXR and bind as monomers and

homodimers to consensus vertebrate DNA half sites and
the direct repeat of the half sites DR0 to DR5.

Methods
cDNAs isolation
cDNAs containing the entire open reading frame (ORF) of
two S. mansoni TRs (SmTRα and SmTRβ) were isolated by
a PCR strategy using a S. mansoni paried adult worm cDNA
library (pBluescript SK (+/-) phagemid) pool as template
DNA. The PCR primers for one end (either 5' or 3' end)
were designed according to a fragment encoding the previously identified DBD region of each gene [9]. The
primer for the other end (either 5' or 3' end) was a vector
universal primer (M13-Rev and T3, or M13-For and T7
primers). PCR products were separated on 1.2% agarose
gels, ligated into pCR2.1 TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and
sequenced. After the correct fragments were identified, the
cDNA sequence containing the 5' UTR, ORF and 3' UTR

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2007, 7:150

were obtained by PCR. Each cDNA was shown to be
related to a single mRNA species by sequencing the PCR
products obtained from single-stranded cDNA using
primers located within the 5'UTR and 3'UTR of each gene.
Database search
Whole genomic sequences (WGS) were extracted from the
GenBank public ftp site [45] and imported into the StarBlast program (DNASTAR) to build a local database [18]
which was searched by tblastn using the sequence of the
DBD of SmTRα as the query. Any sequence that contained
a zinc finger structure of the DBD (Cys-X2-Cys-X13-CysX2-Cys or Cys-X5-Cys-X9-Cys-X2-Cys) was retained.
Sequence walking was carried out to assemble the contigs.
Website databases of GenBank (nr, EST_human,
EST_mouse and EST_other databases) Genbank blast
[46], European Bioinformatics Institute [47] and SwissProt [48] were also mined by tblasn or blastp using the
same query sequence as above [18].
BAC library screening and BAC DNA sequencing
S. mansoni BAC clones containing SmTRα and SmTRβ
were identified by screening S. mansoni SmBAC1 or
CHOR-1 BAC library with methods previously described
[23]. For BAC DNA sequencing, the BAC clone was grown
in 100 ml LB medium (12.5 µg/ml choramphenicol) and
the BAC DNA was purified using Plasmid Midi kit (Qiagen) and sequenced on an ABI-377 automatic sequencing
machine.
Phylogenetic tree construction
Phylogenetic trees were constructed from deduced
sequences of the DBD and the sequence of DBD plus LBD,
respectively. Sequences were aligned with ClustalW [49].
Phylogenetic analysis of the data set was carried out using
Maximum Likelihood method under Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) substitution model [50] with a gamma distribution of rates between sites (eight categories, parameter
alpha, estimated by the program) using PHYML (v2.4.4))
[51] with support values obtained by bootstrapping a 100
replicates. The same data set was also tested by Bayesian
inference using MrBAYES v3.1.1 with a JTT amino acid
replacement model + gamma rates [52]. The trees were
started randomly; four simultaneous Markov chains were
run for 5 million generations for the DBD data set and 3
million generations for the DBD+LBD data set, respectively. The trees were sampled every 100 generations, the
Bayesian posterior probabilities (PPs) were calculated
using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling
approach implemented in MrBAYES v3.1.1, with a burnin value setting at 12,500 for DBD data set and 7,500 generations for the DBD+LBD data set, respectively.

GST Pull-down
cDNAs encoding part of the hinge region plus the LBD
domain of SmTRα (Val739-Glu1115) and SmTRβ
(Pro487-Cys847) were inserted into pGEX-4T-1 vectors to
form pGEX-SmTRα(LBD) and pGEX-SmTRβ(LBD). cDNA
encoding SmRXR1 was previously inserted into pCITE-4a
vector to form pCITE-SmRXR1 [19]. E. coli AD 494 (DE3)
pLys S competent cells (Novagen) were transformed with
pGEX-SmTRα(LBD) or pGEX-SmTRβ(LBD) and the GST
fusion proteins were purified by passage over a glutathione-Sepharose column according to standard protocols.
pCITE-SmRXR1 was transcribed and translated using the
Single Tube Protein System (Novagen) following the
manufacture's protocol to produce 35S labeled protein.
For pull-down experiments, a 50 µl reaction that contained 2 µl of the in vitro translation reaction,
SmTRα(LBD) or SmTRβ(LBD) GST fusion protein, or GST
protein (negative control) affixed to glutathione-Sepharose beads (about 2 µg) and binding buffer (50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.15% Nonidet P40) was used [19]. The reaction was incubated overnight at 4°C and then washed three times with binding
buffer. The bound proteins were analyzed by 10% SDSPAGE and autoradiography.
Electrphoretic mobility shift assay (EMSAs)
cDNA encoding SmTRα, SmTRβ and SmTRα(Gln182Ala288) (containing 20 aa at the 5' end of the DBD, DBD
and 40 aa at the 3' end of the DBD) was inserted into
pCITE-4a vector to form pCITE-SmTRα, pCITE-SmTRβ
and pCITE-SmTRα(Gln182-Ala288). The protein was produced in vitro using TNT quick coupled transcription/
translation system (Promega). The following complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides containing consensus half-sites AGGTCA were synthesized:

half-site: 5'-GTACCGTAAGGTCACTCGCGT-3',
DR0: 5'-CCGTAAGGTCAAGGTCACTCG-3',
DR1: 5'-CCGTAAGGTCACAGGTCACTCG-3',
DR2: 5'-CCGTAAGGTCACAAGGTCACTCG-3',
DR3: 5'-CCGTAAGGTCACAGAGGTCACTCG-3',
DR4: 5'-CCGTAAGGTCACAGGAGGTCACTCG-3',
DR5: 5'-CCGTAAGGTCACCAGGAGGTCACTCG-3'.
Pal0: 5'-CGCAAGGTCATGACCTCG-3' [19]. One strand
of each oligonucleotide was annealed after incubation at
100°C for 3 minutes to its complementary oligonucleotide and then labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and
γ-32P adenosine triphosphate. The binding reactions were

incubated on ice for 40 minutes in 15 µl reaction mixture
containing 40,000 cpm of probe, 3 µl in vitro translation
reaction, 3 µl 5 × buffer (20% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl2, 2.5
mM EDTA, 2.5 mM DTT, 250 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 7.5) and 0.25 mg/ml poly(dI-dC)poly (dI-dC)). The
reaction was separated on 6% (v/v) native polyacrylamide
gel containing 2.5% glycerol in 1 × TBE buffer at 4°C [19].
Gels were dried, exposed to x-ray film and autoradiographed.
