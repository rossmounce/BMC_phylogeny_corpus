Abstract
Background: Porcine enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (PEPEC) strains of serogroup O45 cause
post-weaning diarrhea and produce characteristic attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions. Most O45
PEPEC strains possess the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), encoding the virulence factors
required for production of A/E lesions, and often possess the paa gene, which is thought to
contribute to the early stages of PEPEC pathogenicity. In this study, nine O45 PEPEC strains and a
rabbit enteropathogenic (REPEC) strain, known to produce A/E lesions in vivo, were characterized
using an E. coli O157-E. coli K12 whole genome microarray and a virulence gene-specific microarray,
and by PCR experiments.
Results: Based on their virulence gene profiles, the 10 strains were considered to be atypical
EPEC. The differences in their genomes pointed to the identification of two distinct evolutionary
groups of O45 PEPEC, Groups I and II, and provided evidence for a contribution of these genetic
differences to their virulence in pigs. Group I included the REPEC strain and four O45 PEPEC
strains known to induce severe A/E lesions in challenged pigs whereas Group II was composed of
the five other O45 PEPEC strains, which induced less severe or no A/E lesions in challenged pigs.
Significant differences between Groups I and II were found with respect to the presence or absence
of 50 O-Islands (OIs) or S-loops and 13 K-islands (KIs) or K-loops, including the virulenceassociated islands OI#1 (S-loop#1), OI#47 (S-loop#71), OI#57 (S-loop#85), OI#71 (S-loop#108),
OI#115, OI#122, and OI#154 (S-loop#253).
Conclusion: We have genetically characterized a collection of O45 PEPEC strains and classified
them into two distinct groups. The differences in their virulence gene and genomic island content
may influence the pathogenicity of O45 PEPEC strains, and explain why Group I O45 PEPEC strains
induced more severe A/E lesions in explants and challenged pigs than Group II strains.

Background
Escherichia coli of serogroup O45 may be isolated both in
intestinal and extraintestinal sites, although they have
been only sporadically described in the latter [1-3]. On
the other hand, intestinal E. coli strains have been more
frequently identified as belonging to this serogroup. Intestinal O45 E. coli strains have been isolated from animals
and humans and have been classified as both enterotoxigenic (ETEC) and attaching and effacing (AEEC) E. coli,
the latter including both enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) and
enteropathogenic (EPEC) E. coli [4-6]. Serogroup O45 is
particularly important among porcine EPEC (PEPEC)
strains which cause post-weaning diarrhea (PWD) characterized by specific attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions [79]). Most O45 PEPEC strains possess the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) pathogenicity island, which contains virulence genes necessary for the production of A/E
lesions. They also often possess the paa gene (for porcine
A/E associated gene), which encodes a virulence factor
involved in the A/E phenotype and is thought to contribute to the early stages of PEPEC pathogenicity [10]. These
strains also have the ability to produce A/E lesions in
experimentally inoculated newborn gnotobiotic piglets
and in a homologous in vitro model using newborn piglet
ileal explants, as well as to adhere to PK15 porcine kidney
cells in vitro [10-14].
Genomic islands (GIs) such as LEE are regions of bacterial
genomes that have been acquired by horizontal gene
transfer and often contain blocks of genes that function
together in specific processes. When the genomes of the
two E. coli O157:H7 strains EDL933 and Sakai were compared with that of E. coli K12 strain MG1655, the GIs
found to be present in strains EDL933 and Sakai but
absent in strain MG1655 were named O-islands (OIs) and
Sakai loops (S-loops), respectively. The GIs found to be
present in E. coli K12 but absent from the two E. coli
O157:H7 strains were named K-islands (KIs) and K-loops,
respectively [15-17]. GIs related to the virulence of a pathogen are also referred to as pathogenicity islands (PAIs)
[18]. In E. coli O157:H7 strain EDL933, several large OIs
encode virulence or putative virulence factors. These OIs
include OI#45 (S-loop#69) and OI#93 (S-loop#153) for
Shiga toxin 2 and 1, respectively, OI#148 (S-loop#244)
for LEE, and OI#57 (S-loop#85) for paa [16,17].
A recent microarray-based study has catalogued genomic
alterations in a collection of E. coli O157:H7 strains, particularly in GIs, suggesting the existence of two dominant
lineages, with characteristics that are unique to each of
them [19]. Previous studies performed on various AEEC
strains have also shown that, depending on their pathotype and host specificity, strains can show variations in
their LEE sequences as well as in the site of insertion of
LEE in the chromosome [14,20,21]. The purpose of the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/402

present study was to examine the genotypic differences,
particularly in LEE sequences and chromosomal insertion
sites, and in the presence or absence of non LEE-encoded
virulence factors, such as Paa, among a collection of O45
PEPEC strains which have been previously shown to
induce A/E lesions in pigs. In this study, we have characterized O45 PEPEC strains using a DNA-microarray
designed specifically for detection of E. coli virulence
genes [22] and compared their genomes using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and PCR. We identified two distinct groups of PEPEC O45 strains, between
which there were significant variations in GI content.

Methods
Bacterial strains and preparation of genomic DNA
Nine O45 PEPEC strains, which were isolated at the Faculté de médecine vétérinaire, Saint-Hyacinthe, Québec,
Canada, from pigs with PWD [13] were used for the
microarray studies (Table 1). These strains were selected
based, i) on their ability to produce or not A/E lesions in
challenged pigs [13] and in an homologous ex vivo model
using newborn piglet ileal explants (data not shown), ii)
and on the severity of the A/E manifestation they produced [13] (Table 1). Because of its genetic and phenotypic similarities with the O45 PEPEC strains [23], the
O103 rabbit EPEC (REPEC) strain E22, provided by Eric
Oswald (INRA, Toulouse, France) [24,25], was included
in the study. Five E. coli reference strains were used as controls in PCR experiments: the two O157:H7 E. coli strains
EDL933 and Sakai, the K12 strain MG1655, the uropathogenic (UPEC) strain CFT073 and the REPEC strain
RDEC-1.

For DNA preparations, strains were grown overnight in 45
mL of Brain-Heart-Infusion (BHI) broth at 37°C. The cultures were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 minutes and the
pellet was dissolved in 15 mL of 10 mM NaCl, 20 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 100 μg/mL proteinase K
and 0.5% SDS. This suspension was incubated at 50°C for
2 h and DNA was extracted with an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1). Following
centrifugation for 10 min at 8000 rpm, the upper phase
was removed and precipitated by adding 0.1 volume of 3
M NaOAc (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of 99% ethanol. The
DNA precipitate was then spooled out of the solution
using a sterile glass rod, washed with 70% ethanol, and
dissolved in 5 mL of TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA,
pH 8.0) buffer.
E. coli DNA microarrays
For the whole genome microarray (named E. coli
O157:H7 microarray), Corning Ultra-Gap II slides (Corning, Acton, MA) were spotted with the MWG E. coli
O157:H7 array set (MWG Biotech). The MWG array set
consists of 6167 50-mer oligonucleotides covering the

coli O157:H7 strains Sakai (RIMD 0509952) [16] and
EDL933 (ATCC700927) [17].
The E. coli virulence microarray used in this study was
derived from the one previously developed by Bruant et al.
and included 315 70-mer oligonucleotides specific for
189 E. coli virulence or putative virulence genes or markers
found in various intestinal and extraintestinal E. coli
strains of all known pathotypes [22]. Probes were specific
for genes encoding adhesins; toxins; bacteriocins; antiaggregative factors; autotransporters; capsular, flagellar,
and somatic antigens; hemolysins; invasins; iron acquisition systems or transport proteins; and outer membrane
proteins, as well as other genes recently shown to be associated with virulence in E. coli. This microarray also
detected genetic variants of particular genes, such as the
intimin-encoding gene eae (variants alpha, alpha2, beta,
beta2, delta, epsilon, epsilon2, eta, gamma, gamma2,
iota, iota2, lambda, mu, nu, pi, xi, and zeta), espA (variants espA1, espA2, and espA3), espB (variants espB1, espB2,
and espB3), and tir (variants tir-1, tir-2, and tir-3) from the
LEE. Oligonucleotides specific for three variants of the
major fimbrial subunit of the long polar fimbria (LPF)encoding gene lpfA were also included. These were based
on sequences from the lpfA genes of EPEC strains of serogroup O113 (lpfAO113), OI#141 from E. coli of serotype
O157:H7 (lpfA1), and REPEC strains and E. coli of serogroup O26 (lpfAR141).

Microarray hybridizations
Prior to E. coli O157:H7 microarray hybridization, each
array was pre-hybridized at 50°C in a solution of 5 × SSC,
0.1% SDS and 0.1% BSA for 1 h. Following this step,
arrays were washed completely in dH2O, rinsed with isopropanol, and then centrifuged and dried. For hybridization, 5 μg of test genomic DNA were digested with EcoRV
and PstI restriction enzymes, 3 μg of which were labeled
with ULYSIS Alexa Fluor 647 dye (Invitrogen, Burlington,
ON). Genomic DNA from strains MG1655, Sakai and
EDL933 was digested in an analogous fashion, and 1 μg
of the preparation from each strain was combined and
labeled with Alexa Fluor 546 dye (Invitrogen, Burlington,
ON). This labeled genomic DNA mixture was then used as
a reference for all hybridizations. Unincorporated dye was
removed using Qiaquick PCR purification kits (Qiagen,
Mississauga, ON), according to the manufacturer's
instructions, and DNA was eluted in 30 μl of 0.1 × TE
buffer. Labeled DNA was vacuum-dried and resuspended
in 20 μl of dH2O. A 70 μl hybridization solution consisting of 30% formamide, 5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml
sonicated Salmon sperm DNA, and equal amounts of test
and reference labeled DNAs, each containing at least 30
pmol of incorporated dye, was denatured at 95°C for 5
min and briefly centrifuged to collect all the contents.
DNA preparations were then hybridized overnight (16 h)
at 42°C. After hybridization, arrays were washed according to the modified Corning method (Corning). Arrays
were then scanned with a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon

Instruments, Redwood City, CA) and processed using
GenePix Pro 5.0. Two slides were hybridized per strain
with a dye-swap repeat per slide.
Hybridizations on E. coli virulence microarrays were performed as described previously [22]. Arrays were scanned
with a ScanArray® Lite fluorescent microarray analysis system (Canberra-Packard Canada, Montreal, Quebec) and
acquisition and quantification of fluorescent spot intensities were performed using the ScanArray Express® software
version 2.1 (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA, USA).

– ECs1812R (CCGCAATCCGAATTACC) for nleA, and
nleC-F (AAGTGTAATACGCGCCGTCC) – nleC-R
(ATCAGGACTCGCCTCATATC) and ECs0847F (CCCATTGCTCCTAATCG) – ECs0847R (CAGCGGAATACTCTGTG) for nleC. The conditions for amplifications were an
initial denaturation of 95°C for 5 min, followed by 30
cycles of 95°C for 30 s; 55°C for 30 s; 72°C for 80 s and
a final elongation of 72°C for 10 min.

Results
Microarray data analysis
Data obtained from E. coli O157:H7 microarrays were
normalized using the Ratio-based and Lowess methods in
Acuity 3.1 (Axon instruments) before analysis. The normalized data for all strains were converted into log2 (Fluor
647/Fluor 546) in Acuity 3.1 and subsequently analyzed
in Microsoft Excel. Control, blank, and test spots with a
mean intensity below that of the mean of all negative controls were removed from the analysis. The arithmetic
mean of the remaining spots across the four duplicates
was calculated to construct the dataset. GACK (for
Genomotyping Analysis by Charles Kim) [26], was used
to generate a cut-off value determining the presence or
absence of genes, and a dendrogam using the Euclidean
distance metric with average linkage was created with
tMEV v4.1 [27].

For the data obtained from E. coli virulence microarrays,
the local background was subtracted from the recorded
spot intensities. The median value of each set of triplicate
spotted oligonucleotides was then compared to the
median value of the negative control spots present on the
array. Oligonucleotides with a signal-to-noise fluorescence ratio greater than 2.0 were considered as positive.
Microarray data accession number
The microarray data have been deposited in NCBI's Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO accession number GSE17036)
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/.
PCR experiments
PCR experiments were performed for the nine O45 PEPEC
strains and the REPEC strain E22 to determine the localization in their chromosome of the LEE and of the OI#122,
as well as the integrity of the OI#122 and of the secondary
type III secretion system gene cluster designated ETT2 (for
E. coli type III secretion 2). All PCR experiments were performed as described in previous studies carried out on the
LEE, OI#122 and ETT2 gene clusters (Additional file 1:
Table S1 [21,23,28-31]).

PCR experiments were also performed for nleA and nleC
genes. The pairs of primers used were nleA-F (ACCG-

Characterization of O45 PEPEC strains using the E. coli
virulence microarray
All O45 PEPEC strains and the REPEC strain E22 were
characterized using the E. coli virulence microarray
described previously, which includes probes targeting virulence genes generally found in AEEC but also virulence
genes from the other E. coli virotypes [22]. All strains possessed their own specific virulence gene profile but were
all classified as atypical EPEC (Additional file 2: Table S2
[32]). They all possessed the LEE genes and shared the
same LEE profile: eae(β) – espA group I – espB group III –
tir group I. In addition, each strain lacked the Shiga toxin
2 encoding genes stx2A and stx2B, as well as the bundle
forming pili (BFP) encoding gene bfpA and the E. coli
adherence factor (EAF) virulence plasmid marker eaf.
Remarkably, all O45 PEPEC strains and REPEC strain E22,
although stx1A-negative, gave a positive hybridization for
the stx1B gene, which encodes the B subunit of EHEC
Shiga-like toxin 1 and which is generally absent in EPEC
strains. However, the presence of the stx1B gene was not
confirmed in PCR experiments (data not shown).

The E. coli strains could be classified into two distinct
groups according to their virulence gene pattern (Additional file 2: Table S2 [32]). Group I included the four
PEPEC strains ECL1001, ECL2004, ECL2017, and
ECL2033, and REPEC strain E22. Group II included the
five other PEPEC strains ECL2019, ECL2020, ECL2027,
ECL2076, and ECL2078. Results obtained with the E. coli
virulence microarray identified 19 virulence genes that
showed a non-random distribution between Group I and
Group II strains (Additional file 2: Table S2 [32]). Genes
b1121 (encoding a hypothetical protein YcfZ), set (encoding a probable enterotoxin, also named ent), tspE4.C2 (an
anonymous fragment), efa1 (encoding the EHEC factor
for adherence Efa1), and paa were present in all Group I
strains, including REPEC strain E22, but absent from all
Group II strains. The temperature sensitive hemagglutinin
encoding gene tsh, the yersiniabactin-related genes fyuA,
irp1 and irp2, as well as the PAI-associated gene malX were
present in all O45 PEPEC strains from Group I but in neither REPEC strain E22 nor Group II strains. The heat-stable enterotoxin encoding gene astA was present in all O45

PEPEC Group I strains and in Group II strain ECL2020 but
absent from all other Group II strains and REPEC strain
E22.

diarrheogenic strains belong to group A and group B1
[33]. Determination of the phylogenetic groups of the
O45 PEPEC strains and REPEC strain E22 was based on
the presence or absence of the two genes chuA and yjaA,
and the DNA fragment tspE4.C2, as described by Clermont et al. [32]. All Group I strains including REPEC
strain E22 were classified in phylogenetic group B1 and all
Group II strains were classified in phylogenetic group B2.

The genes aidaI (encoding the Adhesin Involved in E. coli
Diffuse Adherence), chuA (an iron related gene), ECs1282
(encoding a probable filamentous hemagglutinin-like
protein), rtx (encoding a putative RTX family exoprotein),
and yjaA (encoding a hypothetical protein) were present
in all Group II strains but absent from Group I strains,
including REPEC strain E22. The gene fepC (encoding a
ferric enterobactin transport ATP-binding protein) was
present in three Group II strains (ECL2019, ECL2078 and
ECL2027) but absent from all other strains.

CGH-Genomotyping of PEPEC strains
The CGH-based genomotyping analysis of the nine O45
PEPEC strains and the REPEC strain E22 led to their classification into two distinct groups in the same distribution
as observed by the E. coli virulence microarray. A dendrogram based on the analysis of the CGH data for O45
PEPEC strains and REPEC strain E22, as well as for the two
O157:H7 strains Sakai and EDL933 is presented in Figure
1. The distribution of GIs in O45 PEPEC strains and
REPEC strain E22 was investigated by analysis of the CGH
data. Since the microarray used for CGH was not an EPECspecific microarray and was composed of oligonucleotide
probes specific for genome sequences of O157:H7 EHEC
and K12 strains, it was not possible to investigate all the
GIs in O45 PEPEC strains. The divergences in GIs
observed by CGH could thus indicate either the absence
of particular genes or the presence of different variants of
these genes. As shown in Table 2, 63 GIs (islands or loops)
were found to be significantly different between Group I
and Group II strains. Among these 63 GIs, 13 were KIs or

In addition, Group I and Group II strains possessed different variants of the fliC (encoding the flagellin major subunit) and lpfA genes. O45 PEPEC strains from Group I,
including REPEC strain E22, possessed the fliC variant
flmA54, whereas Group II strains possessed the fliC gene.
Group I strains also possessed the lpfAO113 and lpfAR141
variants, whereas REPEC strain E22 only possessed the
lpfAR141 variant, and Group II strains possessed the lpfA1
variant.
Previous phylogenetic analyses have shown that most E.
coli strains belonged to the four main phylogenetic groups
A, B1, B2, and D. Whereas extraintestinal E. coli strains
belong mainly to groups B2 and D, most commensal and

K-loops and 50 were OIs or S-loops. Twenty GIs were
present in Group I strains but absent in Group II strains,
including OI#57 (S-loop#85), which contains the paa
gene, and the two virulence related GIs, OI#71 (Sloop#108) [34] and OI#122 [35,36]. On the other hand,
33 GIs were absent in Group I strains but present in Group
II strains, including OI#1 (S-loop#1), OI#47 (S-loop#71)
and OI#154 (S-loop#253), which contain fimbriae
related genes. KI#60 (K-loop#97), which was absent in all
Group II strains, was present in the four O45 PEPEC
strains from Group I but not in REPEC strain E22. Interestingly, for seven GIs, more than half of the ORFs in each
island were present in all Group I strains whereas these
GIs were absent in all Group II strains. Conversely, for two
GIs, more than half of the ORFs in each island were
present in Group II strains whereas these GIs were absent
in Group I strains.

In addition to the 63 GIs found to be significantly different between Group I and Group II strains, 26 other GIs
were conserved in both Groups (Table 3). Eight of these
GIs were KIs or K-loops and 18 were OIs or S-loops.
Finally, analysis of the E. coli O157:H7 microarray data
indicated that the Shiga toxin encoding genes stx1 and stx2
could not be detected in any of the O45 PEPEC strains or
in the REPEC strain E22, and that similarly, all strains
were lacking both the tccp (ECs2715/Z3072) and tccp2
(ECs1126/Z1385) genes, which encode E. coli O157:H7
type III effector proteins that couple the intimin receptor
Tir to the actin-cytoskeleton, and trigger actin polymerization [37-40].
Analysis of LEE by the E. coli O157:H7 microarray
Thirty of the 41 genes on LEE (OI#148/S-loop#244) were
found to be conserved among the O45 PEPEC strains,

REPEC strain E22, and the two O157:H7 strains EDL933
and Sakai (Table 4). These included the effector-encoding
genes espA, espF and espG, the regulator ler, and most of
the genes of the type III secretion pathway such as sepL,
escD, cesT, escN, escV, sepD, escC, cesD, escU, escT, escS, and
escR. For the 11 remaining genes on LEE, no hybridization
was observed in the O45 PEPEC strains and REPEC strain
E22, possibly reflecting genetic divergences between these
strains and the O157:H7 representative strains EDL933
and Sakai. These genes were the effector-encoding genes
espB, espD, and espH, intimin and the translocated intimin
receptor-encoding genes eae and tir, the genes of the type
III secretion pathway sepQ, sepZ, and escJ, and the genes

reported that the site of insertion of LEE in PEPEC strains
could be either in selC or in pheU [23], the O45 PEPEC
strains in our study and REPEC strain E22 were examined
by PCR using primers specific for these two genes and for
LEE extremities (Additional file 1: Table S1 [21,23,2831]). The LEE was found to be inserted into the tRNA pheU
locus in all examined strains. Remarkably, an amplicon of
500 bp longer than the expected size was also obtained
with primers specific for LEE extremities and selC for
strains ECL2033 and ECL2020 (Additional file 3: Table S3
[22]).
Similarly, the localization and integrity of OI#122 was
determined by PCR using primers described previously
(Additional file 1: Table S1 [21,23,28-31]). All Group I
strains possessed this GI and were positive for the four
genes tested; efa1, ent, nleB, and nleE, with the latter two
encoding non-LEE virulence factors. OI#122 was found to

two different primer sets for each gene (Additional file 1:
Table S1 [21,23,28-31]) revealed amplicons of various
sizes in the different strains, showing that the nleA and
nleC genes in Group I were different from those in Group
II (data not shown).

nle genes in O45 PEPEC strains
The E. coli O157:H7 microarray used in our CGH studies
contains oligonucleotide probes specific for genes encoding non-LEE factors which have previously been associated with the pathogenicity of AEEC strains [34,41]. The
nleA and nleC genes were present in all O45 PEPEC strains
and REPEC strain E22 as determined by the O157:H7

between Group I and Group II strains (Table 5). The five
genes espY3, espX2, espR1, espL3' (Z5199/ECs4642), and
espL3' (Z5200/ECs4643) were absent in all Group I strains
but present in Group II strains. On the other hand, the five
genes espX7, espK, espL2, nleB1, and nleE were present in all
Group I strains but absent in Group II strains. The four

genes nleG2-1', espO1-2, nleG, and nleG9' were present in
all Group I strains with the exception of REPEC strain E22,
and absent in Group II strains. The gene nleB2-1 was
present in all Group II strains and also in REPEC strain
E22 but absent in the other Group I strains. The gene nleD
was present in only two Group I strains, ECL2004 and
ECL2033, and absent in all the other strains, including
REPEC strain E22.
Two additional nle genes, nleF and nleH, were present in
all O45 PEPEC strains. nleH, but not nleF, was also present
in REPEC strain E22 (Table 5).
Distribution of ETT2 genes
OI#115, initially described in E. coli of serotype O157:H7
and present in other EPEC and EHEC strains from animals
and humans, contains the secondary type III secretion system gene cluster ETT2 [31,42,43]. CGH data analysis
revealed that all Group II strains had the entire ETT2 locus
comprising 36 genes, with the exception of strain
ECL2019, which lacked most of this GI (Additional file 4:
Table S4 [16]).

In contrast, Group I strains possessed only a partially
intact locus and the occurrence of the ETT2 genes was
highly variable. Among the 36 ETT2 genes, strain
ECL2033 possessed only 21, strain ECL2004 possessed
20, strain ECL1001 possessed 17, and strain ECL2017
possessed 15. Finally, REPEC strain E22 possessed 21
genes of this GI. These results were confirmed by PCR as
described previously [31], with primers specific for different regions of the ETT2 gene cluster (Additional file 1:
Table S1 [21,23,28-31]).
Genes required for intestinal colonization in the bovine
Previous studies have identified several genes required for
EHEC intestinal colonization of the bovine [44,45].
Microarray analysis in our study revealed that 13 genes
associated with colonization of either E. coli O157:H7 or
E. coli O26:H- in the bovine were associated with either
Group I or Group II strains (Additional file 5: Table S5).
Seven genes were present in Group I but not in Group II
strains, with the exception of REPEC strain E22 which did
not possess the gene Z6010 (ECs1824). In contrast, six
other genes were present in Group II but not in Group I
strains, with the exception of REPEC strain E22 which
possessed the gene Z1526 (ECs1270). These results were
confirmed by PCR using primers designed for each gene
(data not shown).

Discussion
In this study, we investigated the genetic relationships
among PEPEC strains of serogroup O45 and catalogued
genomic alterations unique to these strains by using both
a virulence gene-specific microarray and a whole genome
microarray. The 045 PEPEC strains in this study have been

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/402

previously characterized for their capacity to induce A/E
lesions in both explants and challenged pigs, and were
grouped according to the severity of the A/E manifestation
they produced [13]. Based on their virulence gene content
as determined by the E. coli virulence microarray, O45
PEPEC strains and REPEC strain E22 displayed significant
differences from typical EPEC and could be regarded as
atypical EPEC, that are defined as LEE-positive E. coli lacking stx1 and stx2 genes, as well as the EAF virulence plasmid
which encodes the EPEC adhesin BFP [46,47]. In addition, all O45 PEPEC strains and REPEC strain E22 unexpectedly hybridized with the stxB1 probe of the E. coli
virulence microarray, as was also observed for some atypical EPEC strains isolated from children with diarrhea in a
recent study in Norway [35,48]. Due to the absence of
hybridization with the corresponding stxA1 probe and the
negative PCR results obtained with stxB1 sequence specific
primers [35,48], we therefore concluded that the gene
sequences detected by the stxB1 hybridization probe did
not represent a complete stxB gene but rather a possible
truncated form of this gene.
As observed for other atypical EPEC strains, O45 PEPEC
strains and REPEC strain E22 also displayed a relatively
high heterogeneity in their virulence gene profiles [35,49].
Based on their virulence gene content, they could be
divided into two distinct groups, Groups I and II. It has
been argued that atypical EPEC strains could have arisen
from E. coli strains of different pathotypes which acquired
the LEE by horizontal gene transfer or from certain typical
EPEC strains that have lost the EAF plasmid [49]. Trabulsi
et al. have also observed that some atypical EPEC strains
are genetically closer to EHEC strains of serotype
O157:H7 than to typical EPEC [50]. Several virulence
genes showed a non-random distribution between Group
I and Group II strains. Group I strains thus possessed several virulence-related genes which were absent in Group II
strains. Group I-specific genes included paa (which contributes to A/E lesion formation in PEPEC strains [10])
and OI#122 genes efa1 (which plays an important role in
intestinal colonization by EHEC strains in cattle [51]) and
set (which encodes a putative enterotoxin highly similar
to the enterotoxin ShET2 of Shigella flexneri). Genes associated with other pathotypes were also found. The gene
tsh, encoding a hemagglutinin which may be a virulence
factor of avian extraintestinal E. coli [52], the pathogenicity island marker malX, related to virulence in extraintestinal E. coli [53] and the yersiniabactin-related genes fyuA,
irp1 and irp2, implicated in the ferric uptake system, were
also Group I-specific. In contrast, Group II strains possessed only a few additional virulence-related genes when
compared with Group I strains. These included aidaI,
which encodes a protein involved in the adherence of
EPEC [54], and iron uptake-related genes chuA and fepC.
Finally, Group I and Group II strains also possessed different variants of the long polar fimbriae encoding gene lpfA.

A recent study has shown that the lpfAO113 variant, found
in Group I strains in our study, was found significantly
more frequently in atypical EPEC strains associated with
cases of diarrhea than in strains isolated from healthy
individuals [35].
It is interesting to note that analysis by CGH using a whole
genome E. coli microarray, representing two lineage I,
human outbreak-related E. coli O157:H7 strains and one
non-pathogenic E. coli K12 strain, resulted in the distribution of the O45 PEPEC strains into the same two groups
(Groups I and II), observed for the E. coli virulence microarray. This genetic-based grouping, principally reflecting
the virulence gene content of the strains, was also compatible with the grouping based on their A/E activity [13].
The O45 PEPEC strains of Group I all induced severe A/E
lesions whereas those of Group II induced less severe or
no A/E lesions in both pig ileal explants and challenged
pigs. REPEC strain E22 was placed into Group I but was
genetically distant from the four O45 PEPEC strains
belonging to this group. These strains showed a relatively
high level of heterogeneity in their virulence gene profiles.
In addition to the variations in particular virulence genes,
significant variations in GIs were also observed between
Group I and II strains. We observed that several virulencerelated OIs were present only in Group I strains. These
included OI#57 (S-loop#85), which contains the paa
gene; OI#71 (S-loop#108), which contains the non-LEE
encoded factor gene nleA, previously shown to be associated with the pathogenicity of AEEC strains [34]; and
OI#122 which contains the two non-LEE encoded factor
genes nleB and nleE and virulence genes efa1 and set. Interestingly, these OIs have also been shown to be more prevalent in STEC strains associated with outbreaks and severe
disease [35,36]. On the other hand, certain OIs were only
present in Group II strains. These include OI#1 (Sloop#1), containing genes encoding putative fimbrial
chaperone proteins; OI#47 (S-loop#71), containing a
fimbrial operon and genes encoding several additional
putative virulence factors in E. coli of serogroup O157
[55]; and OI#154 (S-loop#253), containing genes encoding putative type 1 fimbrial proteins. Finally, OI#115 was
highly divergent between Group I and Group II strains.
This OI contains the secondary type III secretion system
gene cluster ETT2, which resembles the SPI-1-encoded
type III secretion system from Salmonella enterica and has
been previously characterized in O157:H7 E. coli strains
[16,17]. It has been recently shown that ETT2 influences
the secretion of proteins encoded by the LEE and also
modulates adhesion to human intestinal cells [56]. Most
Group II strains (4/5) possessed the entire ETT2. However, Group II strain ECL2019 lacked most of the entire
cluster (only four genes were found to be present) and was
one of the two strains which did not induce A/E lesions in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/402

explants or in challenged pigs. Group I strains, including
REPEC strain E22, have only a partial ETT2 gene cluster,
possessing from 15 to 21 genes of the 36 in the intact cluster. The substantial variations observed for this cluster are
consistent with the findings of previous studies, that while
the ETT2 gene cluster was present in most of the E. coli
strains tested, it contained numerous inactivating mutations [31,42,43].
In contrast to the heterogeneity of their virulence gene
content and GI distribution, O45 PEPEC strains and
REPEC strain E22 showed a high level of homogeneity in
their LEE sequences and site of insertion. In all strains, the
LEE was inserted into the tRNA pheU gene and no significant divergence between Group I and Group II strains was
observed for the LEE genes. In addition, all O45 PEPEC
strains and REPEC strain E22 shared the same profile for
the intimin encoding gene eae, its translocated receptor tir
and the effector encoding genes espA and espB, as shown
by the E. coli virulence microarray. All strains possessed
the beta variant of the intimin encoding gene, being the
most widespread among the intestinal EPEC strains of different animal species [57,58]. However, Group I and
Group II strains from our study all belonged to the phylogenetic groups B1 and B2 whereas Ishii et al. have shown
that most EPEC strains possessing the intimin subtype
beta belong to phylogenetic groups A and B1 [59].
Finally, we have also observed numerous disparities in the
distribution of non-LEE encoded genes. Several nle genes
were only present in Group I strains whereas others were
only found in Group II strains. In addition, Group I and
Group II strains possessed two different variants of the
genes nleA and nleC. This variation in the distribution of
nle genes may influence the pathogenicity of the strains
and the type of A/E lesions they produce, since many studies have shown the importance of non-LEE encoded factors in the A/E phenotype [34,41,60,61].

Conclusion
We have genetically characterized a collection of O45
PEPEC strains using E. coli O157-E. coli K12 whole
genome and virulence gene-specific E. coli microarrays.
We have shown that the strains, although showing some
heterogeneity, could be classified into two groups, based
on their virulence gene and GI content. These differences
in their virulence gene content may influence the pathogenicity of O45 PEPEC strains, and explain why Group I
O45 PEPEC strains induced more severe A/E lesions in
explants and challenged pigs than Group II strains
[13,14].
