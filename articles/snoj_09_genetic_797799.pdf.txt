Abstract
To determine the genetic architecture of trout in Albania, 87 individuals were collected from 19
riverine and lacustrine sites in Albania, FYROM and Greece. All individuals were analyzed for
sequence variation in the mtDNA control region. Among fourteen haplotypes detected, four
previously unpublished haplotypes, bearing a close relationship to haplotypes of the Adriatic and
marmoratus lineages of Salmo trutta, were revealed. Ten previously described haplotypes,
characteristic of S. ohridanus, S. letnica and the Adriatic and Mediterranean lineages of S. trutta, were
also detected. Haplotypes detected in this study were placed in a well supported branch of S.
ohridanus, and a cluster of Mediterranean – Adriatic – marmoratus haplotypes, which were further
delimited into three subdivisions of Mediterranean, marmoratus, and a previously non-described
formation of four Adriatic haplotypes (Balkan cluster). Haplotypes of the Balkan cluster and the
other Adriatic haplotypes, do not represent a contiguous haplotype lineage and appear not to be
closely related, indicating independent arrivals into the Adriatic drainage and suggesting successive
colonization events. Despite the presence of marmoratus haplotypes in Albania, no marbled
phenotype was found, confirming previously reported findings that there is no association between
this phenotype and marmoratus haplotypes.

Introduction
Major European peninsulas are known to have played a
central role in the survival of animal and plants during
ice-age maxima and have received a high degree of attention in terms of conservation of endemic taxa [1,2]. Compared with the Iberian and Italian peninsulas, the
biodiversity and rich level of phenotypic variability
present in the Balkan Peninsula have only recently been
investigated by molecular techniques (e.g. [3-5]). As one

of the 17 biodiversity hotspots of the world [6], this
peninsula harbours numerous endemic taxa [4], including members of the genus Salmo (subsequently referred to
as Balkan trout), which are especially diverse in this
region. Many studies on the morphology and phenotypes
of the fish of the Balkans were undertaken during the last
century (e.g. [7,8]) and found high levels of endemism
among Balkan trout. As a consequence, given the benefit
of availability of modern molecular techniques, a number

of recent studies have focused on revisiting Balkan trout
taxonomy, population structure and demographic history
[9-14]. However, much remains to be done, as the status
of several nominal species and populations of Balkan
trout remains unresolved, mainly as a result of the
region's geographical, political and cultural isolation [15].
Considerable variation in external morphology of Balkan
trout was reported in early studies [16,17], giving rise to
many taxonomic units (see [18] for review). Recent
molecular studies of trout from Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Montenegro and FYROM [10,13,14] have confirmed this
diversity. However, little clear association between phenotype and genotype has been found, and some well-established taxonomic groups, such as S. marmoratus [10], have
been found not to be associated with detected genetic
assemblages.
Several Salmo taxa have been reported to inhabit Albanian
rivers and neighbouring drainages in FYROM and Greece.
Examples include S. farioides, proposed by Karaman [17],
and S. ohridanus, S. letnica, S. letnica lumi, S. trutta, S. macrostigma, S. peristericus, S. marmoratus and S. montenegrinus
[19,18,20,21]. Unfortunately, confirmation of these
observations and the continued existence of such trout in
these waters, as well as their taxonomic status, remain
uncertain, representing an absence from any comprehensive overview of Balkan trout demography, evolution and
classification.
The data that do exist on trout in Albania are very scarce
and mostly stem from an inventory of fishes undertaken
in the country in the 1950s [22], or are restricted to certain
areas (e.g. [21] on Lake Ohrid; [23] on the River Shkumbini). Rakaj [24] extended and brought up to date the
work of Poljakov et al. [22] on Albanian ichthyofauna. He
described trout from the rivers Shala and Valbona (OhridDrin-Shkodra system; see also [25]) as well as from the
lakes Shkodra and Ohrid, while trout have also been
reported to exist within the rivers Bistrica [24], Cemit [24],
Mati [20] and Shkumbini [23].
Very few genetic analyses of Albanian trout have been performed so far and all are restricted to lakes Ohrid and Prespa [26,13,27].
As inferred from several previous studies on Balkan trout
[28,10], anthropogenically induced hybridisation, particularly with introduction of non-native trout lineages, has
had a considerable impact on many indigenous trout
stocks and has blurred the picture of the original genetic
structure and phylogeography of Balkan trout. However,
because of Albania's past political isolation and low level
of economic development, it is probable that stocking
with non-native strains of brown trout (e.g. Atlantic line-

http://www.gsejournal.org/content/41/1/22

age) has not been performed here (I Wilson, personal
communication). Therefore, despite any impact of overfishing and intense poaching (authors' personal observations) on the population sizes of native trout, the present
distribution and composition of trout in Albania may relatively faithfully reflect the natural situation, a rare situation for salmonid rivers in Europe given the widespread
practice of stocking.
In the present survey, we analysed for the first time samples from a both extensive and intensive collection of
trout from Albania and from some neighbouring drainages in FYROM and Greece (13 river basins altogether)
along with S. ohridanus and S. letnica from Albanian
waters of Lake Ohrid.
The main objective of this study was to determine the
genetic architecture of Albanian trout from analysis of the
mitochondrial DNA control region (mtDNA CR), and
thus obtain phylogeographic information that could be
compared with published data and make inferences on
the historical demography and evolution of Balkan trout.
We also looked for any indication of association between
phenotype and mtDNA lineage.

Methods
Trout samples collection
In 2005 and 2006, a total of 78 sampling sites were electrofished in rivers in Albania and the Megali Prespa basin
in FYROM and Greece. The sampling in Albania (73 sampling sites) was performed not only to undertake a trout
census in the country but also for the entire ichthyofauna.
Locations were selected based upon observations published in the literature [23,22,20] and from local people.
Emphasis was placed on both main water streams and isolated locations.

Among the sampled locations in Albania, trout were
found at 15 of them (Fig. 1). Cake and Miho [23] reported
trout at sites 61 and 63 (Fig. 1) in the River Shkumbini
basin. However, during our sampling campaign, trout
were not observed here, though they were found and sampled in two previously non-described locations within
this catchment (62 and 64, Table 1). In addition, trout
were observed for the first time in the River Mati catchment. On the other hand, they were not found at site 35
(on the River Tragjas), where local people report their
existence.
Trout were found at four of the five locations sampled in
the Megali Prespa basin (in Greece and FYROM), including sites 70 and 71, where, according to the literature
[9,29,17], they were expected to exist, and at sites 72 and
74. Trout were not observed at site 73.

Table 1: Sampling locations (numbers as in Figure 1), sample size (N) and haplotype distribution of 14 mtDNA CR haplotypes resolved among 87 trout samples from Albania
(AL), Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) and Greece

Genetics Selection Evolution 2009, 41:22

The authors' general observation was that poaching for
trout was very common in the area sampled, and where
trout still exist, the observed densities were very low.
The 87 trout collected from 19 sites (Figure 1 and Table 1)
were sorted among three species and one genus: S. ohridanus (5), S. letnica (5) and S. peristericus (20), and Salmo sp.
(57). While the first two species are easily recognizable on
the basis of both their distinct phenotype and specific
native range (Lake Ohrid), the classification of S. peristericus was based upon its very restricted distribution (see
[18]). The other specimens were phenotypically indefinable and were therefore assigned as Salmo sp. Mitochondrial DNA haplotypes detected in Albania, Greece and
FYROM are reported in Table 1 and all the haplotypes
used in phylogenetic analysis are listed in Table 2.
DNA amplification and sequencing
Total DNA was isolated from fin tissue preserved in 96%
ethanol following the protocol of Medrano et al. [30]. The
entire sequence of the mitochondrial DNA control region
(mtDNA CR) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) using primers 28RIBa [31] and HN20 [32]. Each 30
μL reaction included 1 μM of each primer, 0.2 μM dNTP,
1.5 μM MgCl2, 1 × PCR buffer, 1 U Taq polymerase
(Applied Biosystems) and 100 ng of genomic DNA. The
conditions for PCR were initial denaturation (95°C, 3
min) followed by 30 cycles of strand denaturation (94°C,
45 s), primer annealing (52°C, 45 s) and DNA extension
(72°C, 2 min). All PCR amplifications were performed in
a programmable thermocycler GeneAmp® PCR System
9700 (Applied Biosystems).

Amplified DNA fragments were run on a 1.5% gel and isolated from the gel using the QIAEX II gel Extraction Kit
(QIAGEN).
The control region fragment between the tRNAPro gene
and poly T-block of the amplified DNA (100 ng of purified PCR product) was sequenced using primer 28RIBa
following ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator protocols
(Applied Biosystems 3.1). The amplified DNA was saltprecipitated and analysed with an ABI PRISM 310 automated sequencer.
Data analysis
Sequences of the 5'-end of the mtDNA CR (ca. 561 bp)
were aligned using the computer program ClustalX [33].
To assign individual haplotypes to trout species and lineages previously identified within the brown trout species
complex, data were aligned against at least three haplotypes from each lineage (Me: Mediterranean; Ma: marmoratus; Da: Danubian; At: Atlantic), and compared to all
known haplotypes found in trout samples across the Adriatic river system (Ad; Table 1).

http://www.gsejournal.org/content/41/1/22

Aligned haplotypes were imported into the program
PAUP Version 4.0b10 [34] for phylogenetic analysis.
Neighbour-Joining (NJ), maximum parsimony (MP),
maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analysis were
used for phylogenetic reconstruction. For NJ, a Kimura 2parameter model was chosen. For MP, insertions or deletions (indels) were included as a fifth character. A heuristic search (10 replicates) with Tree Bisection Reconnection
(TBR) branch-swapping was employed to find the most
parsimonious trees. For ML, a sequence evolution model
was first chosen using the program Modeltest Version 3.7
[35] incorporated into PAUP. After choosing a model, a
heuristic search (10 replicates) was used to estimate the
most likely topology. Support values for the nodes were
obtained with 1000 bootstrap replicates for MP, NJ, or ML
analysis, whereby the fast stepwise addition method was
used for ML. Bayesian analysis was performed with
MrBayes version 3.1.2 [36] where posterior probabilities
were obtained using the Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) technique (Nst = 6, Rates = gamma, Ngen =
5,000,000, chains = 4).
Because of weak support for the Adriatic clade as a whole
(see Results,) the genealogical relation of these haplotypes
was also depicted using a 95% statistical parsimony network constructed from the 5'-end of mtDNA CR
sequences using program TCS 1.3 [37]. Resolution of
ambiguous loops in the TCS network was performed by
comparing ML pair-wise distances of the haplotypes
within a loop and identifying the most likely connections
within it, reflected by the smallest pair-wise distances. ML
pair-wise distances were computed under the model (HKY
85) using the program PAUP Version 4.0b10 [34].

Results
A total of 561 bp of the mtDNA CR was resolved in 87
individuals and compared with corresponding and
already published sequences of various Salmo taxa.
In Lake Ohrid, five haplotypes, all previously described in
Sušnik et al. [38] (marked with "Haplo"), were found,
four of which were detected in S. ohridanus (Haplo 1, 4, 5
and 6) and one in S. letnica (Haplo 12). For the other samples, five already described haplotypes characteristic of the
Adriatic (4) and Mediterranean (1) lineages of S. trutta
were found. In addition, four previously unpublished
haplotypes bearing close relation to others of the Adriatic
(Ad-AL1 to 3) and marmoratus (Ma-AL1) were also
detected.
Salmo peristericus from the FYROM part of the Prespa basin
were fixed for haplotype ADcs1; this haplotype was also
found in the River Valbona system in Albania (River Drin
basin). Haplotype AdPrz was found in the rivers Valbona
and Shala (also River Drin basin).

Haplo14, previously considered private for S. letnica in
Lake Ohrid [13], was in this study found to exist also in
trout in the Drin basin.
It is worth noting that all the samples from the River Bistrica were fixed for Ma-AL1, but none exhibited any phenotypic character state characteristic of S. marmoratus
(field observations).
The highest level of genetic variation appeared to be in the
Drin basin (haplotypes ADcs1, AdPrz and Haplo14) and
the most common haplotype found in this study was
ADcs1, found in Lake Prespa tributaries and the River Valbona.
The phylogenetic organisation of the NJ distance tree
clearly identified four well supported branches (Fig. 2): (i)
S. ohridanus with Haplo1, 4, 5 and 6, (ii) the reference
Danubian haplotypes, (iii) the reference Atlantic haplotypes, and (iv) a cluster of Mediterranean, Adriatic and
marmoratus (ME-AD-MA) haplotypes exhibiting a very
complex but poorly supported clade. All previously unreported haplotypes appeared in this clade.
Character state phylogenetic (i.e., MP, ML and Bayesian)
analyses revealed similar tree-topology with regard to the
four main clades (Fig. 2) and provided a better resolution
of the ME-AD-MA clade showing clear delimitation of
three subdivisions: two already accepted groups of Mediterranean (iv-a) and marmoratus (iv-b) haplotypes
[39,40], and (iv-c), a previously non-described formation
of haplotypes AdRc, AdPrz, AdC1 and AdN (hereafter
referred to as the Balkan cluster). The topology of the
other Adriatic haplotypes remained largely unresolved.
A network gathering the haplotypes found in this study
and those previously published [40,13] is presented in

Figure 3. Haplotype MEcs1 was found to exhibit several
autapomorphies, which separated it considerably from
other haplotypes and complicated the resolution of the
network (data not shown). For this reason, this haplotype
was excluded from further analysis. The general organization of the haplotype network obtained in this study featuring a multiple star-like structure with ADcs1 taking a
central position was similar to the one reported by Cortey
et al. [40] and confirmed in Sušnik et al. [13]. Those newly
described are only one (Ad-AL2, Ad-AL3 and Ma-AL1) or
two (Ad-AL1) mutation steps away from previously
described haplotypes. AdPrz, a common haplotype in the
southern Adriatic drainage [41], and AdRc and AdC1 from
Lake Shkodra basin [13] and AdN from the River Neretva
basin [10] form a separate group in the network, supporting the existence of the corresponding clade inferred from
the phylogenetic tree (iv-c, Fig. 2). Interestingly, marmoratus haplotypes were found to be incorporated into the
Adriatic clade network being apparently closely related to
haplotypes predominantly detected in Ohrid trout (S. letnica).

Discussion
This study reveals for the first time the phylogenetic structure of trout populations in one of the last remaining
incompletely explored regions of trout distribution in
Europe. Drainages in Albania are linked to neighbouring
systems in FYROM and Greece that also belong to the
Adriatic river system as a whole. These rivers and lakes
have been largely unmanaged with respect to stocking of
non-native strains of trout, in contrast with most of the
rest of Europe. However, stocking with trout from the
same location has been practised over many years in Lake
Ohrid, and in at least one tributary of Lake Prespa. Therefore, it was expected that non-native genetic signatures
would not be detected and, indeed, this was the case: e.g.
no haplotypes of Atlantic or Danubian brown trout phyl-

ogenetic lineages were found. Instead, Albanian trout
populations are characterised by mtDNA haplotypes from
the three other previously defined brown trout lineages
[39]: Adriatic, Mediterranean and marmoratus. All of these
three lineages are native to Mediterranean river systems.
Moreover, Lake Ohrid contains the endemic species S.
ohridanus (more closely related to S. obtusirostris of the
Dalmatian river systems), with its unique haplotypes.
Such pronounced genetic diversity places Albanian trout

populations among the most variable in Europe. This
finding is even more remarkable when one considers the
very limited geographic distribution of these trout in
Albania and the neighbouring area. Out of 78 locations
sampled, we expected to find trout in at least 25 of them
but were able to catch trout only in 19 sites. With few
exceptions (sites 39,40,41) trout were always at very low
density and it was difficult to catch more than five in several stations, probably as a result of heavy poaching by

also exist in remote areas they are in danger of extinction.
Congruence between taxonomic group and mtDNA
lineage
Lake Ohrid, the oldest lake in Europe, is shared between
FYROM and Albania. According to historical data [21]
and recent studies [11,38,13,27] at least two trout species,
S. ohridanus and S. letnica, inhabit the lake and samples of
both were included in this survey. Genetic analysis,
including of mtDNA, has already been performed for
these two taxa [38,13]. The results obtained in the present
study corroborate the earlier findings, justifying the distinct taxonomic position of S. ohridanus in relation to its
congeners, and supporting the species status of Ohrid
trout S. letnica for conservation purposes [13]. The present
study found a high frequency of Haplo14 in the Drin river
system (previously reported only for Lake Ohrid), an
unsurprising finding since until 1960 no dams existed
along this river and Lake Ohrid was connected directly
with rest of the system.

The second largest lake in the region, of Tertiary origin (>5
MY), is Lake Megali Prespa, whose tributaries are inhabited by S. peristericus [17]. During the Jurassic, lakes Prespa
and Ohrid formed part of the Dassaretic lakes, which were
linked with the Adriatic Sea. Trout from the River Agios
Germanos, now a tributary of this lake after the stream
was diverted from Lake Mikri Prespa between 1935 and
1945, have already been analysed at allozyme loci [42]
and for mtDNA sequence variation [26]. On the basis of a
diagnostic allele at CK-2*, this population was first
thought to be distinct from other populations of brown
trout in Greece. However, based on subsequent partial
mtDNA CR and cyt b gene sequence analysis, it was then
placed back in the S. trutta complex. All the populations
of S. peristericus examined in the present study were fixed
for the haplotype ADcs1, which distinguished them from
all trout populations surveyed here apart from the population from the River Valbona (Drin basin), where this
haplotype was also found. A recent hypothesis concerning
demographic patterns of the Adriatic lineage [40,14] considers ADcs1 as the central haplotype (Fig. 3): it is the
most common haplotype in the Iberian Peninsula, where
the Adriatic lineage is thought to have originated [40]. The
plesiomorphic state of the haplotype ADcs1 and its presence in S. peristericus indicates its ancestry within the Adriatic lineage and does not support the recognition of this
taxon as a separate species. Nevertheless, given that S. peristericus is distinct morphologically from all other Balkan
trout [9] and restricted geographically to Lake Megali Prespa basin, we stress the importance of this taxon as a unit
that needs conserving.
No marbling phenotype characteristic of marble trout was
observed in any of the individual trout caught in the
present study, even though S. marmoratus has been
reported to be present in the rivers Valbona and Drin
[19,24,25]. On the other hand, the marmoratus haplotype
(Ma-A1) was detected in southern Albania, in the River
Bistrica where Rakaj [20] has described the local form as
S. peristericus. As no marbling was observed in the trout
from this river, this supports the view that the marmoratus
mtDNA lineage and the marbling phenotype are not
linked: previous reports have described the existence of
marmoratus haplotypes in many populations of phenotypically brown trout across the Mediterranean river basins,
including rivers in Dalmatia [39], central Italy [43],
Greece [26] and Corsica (unpublished data). The marbling phenotype is only characteristic of this lineage in its
north Adriatic range, where the phenotype was first
described [44,45].
Phylogeographic considerations
Much effort has been put in resolving salmonid genetic
structure and phylogeographic signals in the Adriatic

drainage [41,10-12,43,38,13,14]. To update the overall
current picture, genetic data on samples from Albania and
neighbouring freshwater systems in FYROM and Greece
can now be incorporated into previously obtained data
and used to make inferences on trout phylogeography and
historical demography in the western Balkans and supplement the current knowledge concerning the rest of the
Adriatic drainage.
The presence of four evolutionary lineage haplotypes (of
S. ohridanus, S. marmoratus, and Adriatic and Mediterranean S. trutta) in Albania points to a complicated demographic history and rich diversity of trout populations in
the country. The lineages AD and ME, both reported here
as present in Albania, have been studied and reviewed
thoroughly by Cortey et al. [40] who suggested that they
had originated in the Iberian peninsula some 150,000
years ago, with haplotypes ADcs1 and MEcs1 as the most
ancestral, respectively. It is thought that these lineages
expanded together from west to east across the Mediterranean basin during the extreme Pleistocene glacial maxima
and therefore would have reached the western Balkans relatively recently. In Albania, the ME haplotype (MEcs1)
was found in a single river basin (River Mati), and was the
only haplotype present there. Indications of a patchwork
distribution of ME haplotypes have already been reported
for the western Mediterranean drainages [40], the Aegean
and Adriatic drainages in Greece [26] and in central Italy
[43]. As Albanian rivers represent the limit of the geographical range of the ME lineage, it seemed likely that
here the concentration of such haplotypes would be low
and that they would be very sensitive to stochastic events
(gene flow, bottlenecks, etc.). Such events appear to have
been particularly intense in the Balkan Peninsula during
the Pleistocene [4] and could be the main reason for both
the present geographical limitations of distribution and
local fixation of the MEcs1 haplotype.
A complex and particularly fuzzy phylogenetic relationship among AD haplotypes, already observed by Cortey et
al. [40] and Sušnik et al. [13], was noticed in this study,
and only the so-called Balkan cluster (haplotypes AdN,
AdRc, AdC1 and AdPrz) was well resolved, with a bootstrap value of 100 per cent in MP and 86 per cent in Bayesian. This cluster corresponds to the AdN-AdPrz cluster
previously described by Marić et al. [41] and Razpet et al.
[10] for the rivers Neretva and Prizrenska Bistrica. In those
studies, the distribution of haplotypes corresponded well
with the distribution of the questionable taxon S. farioides
(from rivers Krka (Croatia), Neretva (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and Prizrenska Bistrica (Kosova), tributaries of
Lake Shkodra (Montenegro) and of the River Drin and
Lake Ohrid) [17,9]. Two additional haplotypes constituting the Balkan cluster and used here as reference haplotypes, AdRc and AdC1, also originate from the S. farioides

http://www.gsejournal.org/content/41/1/22

range (Lake Shkodra tributaries; see [13]) and additionally support the proposed haplotype-species association.
In this study, the haplotype AdPrz was found in the River
Drin basin, the eastern limit of the range of S. farioides,
and close to the type location of Prizren, which shares the
same water shed. Thus, the results from this study support
the congruence of the distribution of the Balkan haplotype cluster and the range of S. farioides. As reported previously [10,13], haplotypes of the Balkan cluster, including
AdPrz, on the one hand and other Ad haplotypes on the
other hand, do not represent a contiguous haplotype lineage (see Fig. 3) and appear not to be closely related, indicating independent arrivals into the Adriatic drainage and
suggesting successive colonization events.
The data referring to the distribution of the marmoratus
haplotype in Albania do not contribute much to resolving
contradictory notions about the centre of origin and
demographic patterns of marmoratus lineage (c.f.,
[46,39,47,48]). The newly described Ma-AL1 haplotype,
recorded for a previously non-surveyed location in Albania, broadens the known genetic diversity of the marmoratus lineage, and highlights its extensive but patchy
distribution, as observed across a broad stretch of Mediterranean river systems [26,39,43].
Balkan trout are composed of a genetic mosaic of haplotypes, related to most of the other trout lineages of the
Mediterranean area analysed and reported in other studies. However, due to a complexity of past migrations, colonisations and extinctions, as well as that of many other
organisms [4], the Balkans has been considered a hotspot
of trout biodiversity. The region's unique mix of habitats
and topography has created a peninsula rich in endemism, and ironically its isolation (both physical and
political) has helped to conserve a complex structure of
trout populations, particularly in Albania. This first investigation of a little explored area has revealed a glimpse
into a partly understandable and partly fuzzy web of relationships.
