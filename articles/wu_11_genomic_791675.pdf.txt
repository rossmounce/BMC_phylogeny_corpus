Abstract
Background: Our previously published reports have described an effective biocontrol agent named Pseudomonas
sp. M18 as its 16S rDNA sequence and several regulator genes share homologous sequences with those of P.
aeruginosa, but there are several unusual phenotypic features. This study aims to explore its strain specific genomic
features and gene expression patterns at different temperatures.
Results: The complete M18 genome is composed of a single chromosome of 6,327,754 base pairs containing 5684
open reading frames. Seven genomic islands, including two novel prophages and five specific non-phage islands
were identified besides the conserved P. aeruginosa core genome. Each prophage contains a putative chitinase
coding gene, and the prophage II contains a capB gene encoding a putative cold stress protein. The non-phage
genomic islands contain genes responsible for pyoluteorin biosynthesis, environmental substance degradation and
type I and III restriction-modification systems. Compared with other P. aeruginosa strains, the fewest number (3) of
insertion sequences and the most number (3) of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats in M18
genome may contribute to the relative genome stability. Although the M18 genome is most closely related to that
of P. aeruginosa strain LESB58, the strain M18 is more susceptible to several antimicrobial agents and easier to be
erased in a mouse acute lung infection model than the strain LESB58. The whole M18 transcriptomic analysis
indicated that 10.6% of the expressed genes are temperature-dependent, with 22 genes up-regulated at 28°C in
three non-phage genomic islands and one prophage but none at 37°C.
Conclusions: The P. aeruginosa strain M18 has evolved its specific genomic structures and temperature dependent
expression patterns to meet the requirement of its fitness and competitiveness under selective pressures imposed
on the strain in rhizosphere niche.

Background
Previously published work from our group has described
an effective biocontrol strain M18 that was isolated from
sweet melon rhizosphere in Shanghai suburb in 1996
[1]. This strain has been named as the Pseudomonas sp.
M18, as its 16S ribosomal DNA sequence shares a high
similarity to that of P. aeruginosa [1], as well as high
sequence identities of several global regulatory genes,
including gacA [2], rpoS [3], qscR [4], rhlI [5], lasI [6]
and rsmA [7]. However, the strain M18 has developed
several unusual features which distinguish it from that

of the clinically significant P. aeruginosa strains, and
indeed are more similar to soil-inhabiting biocontrol
Pseudomonas strains, such as P. fluorescence 2-79 [8],
Pf-5 [9] and P. chlororaphis PCL1391 [10]. Firstly, the
predominant phenazine produced by the strain M18 is
phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) rather than pyocyanin (PYO) [11]. PCA is considered to be a major biocontrol compound [12], while PYO is not necessary for
fungal killing [13]. It was determined that more PCA
could be produced in the strain M18 at 28°C rather
than 37°C compared with that produced by the P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 [11]. Secondly, the strain M18 is the
first strain that was reported to produce two antibiotics,
PCA and pyoluteorin (Plt) in one single strain [1]. The
production of the two antibiotics of the strain M18 can

result in synergistic antifungal activities against several
phytopathogens. The biosynthesis gene clusters of two
antibiotics share 99% nucleotide sequence identity with
the clusters of Liverpool Epidemic Strain P. aeruginosa
LESB58. However, a 5-base-pair deletion exists in the
pltB gene of Plt synthetic cluster resulting in a frameshift mutation in the strain LESB58 [14]. Thirdly, several
interesting features with regards to the regulatory
mechanism of the production of these two antibiotics
were found to be quite different from that in P. aeruginosa. For example, PCA production is negatively regulated and Plt production is positively regulated by a
global regulator named GacA [2]. However, the converse
relationship occurs in the strain M18 through another
global regulator, RsmA [7]. In a more recent study, we
demonstrated the negative effect of the QscR regulator
on PCA production, but not on Plt in the strain M18
[4]. Studies have also been conducted on the differential
regulation of PCA and Plt production by potential
quorum sensing (QS) signaling molecule N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) secreted by this strain [5,6]. The
interrelationship between the QS las and rhl system in
strain M18 are also different from that in strain P. aeruginosa PAO1 [15].
Besides the biocontrol strain M18, several P. aeruginosa strains, i.e., 7NSK2 [16], PNA1 [17], NJ-15 [18],
PUPa3 [19], which inhabit the rhizosphere niche, have
been found to show excellent plant growth promoting
feature and effective biocontrol property against various
phytopathogens, and are utilized for biopesticide development. The genetically modified strain M18 has been
recently developed as a high yield antifungal antibiotic
PCA producer [20-22]. However, little information is
available on their specific genome structures, transcriptome profiles and virulence activities compared to their
clinical counterparts.
A series of complete genomic sequences of P. aeruginosa strains that originated from patients [14,23-25]
have been published recently, and normal environmental
P. aeruginosa isolates were chosen to compare their
virulence and genomic structures [26,27]. To date, none
of P. aeruginosa strains that originate from the rhizosphere has been completely sequenced and analyzed in
detail. This study aims to delineate the genomic structural differences among various P. aeruginosa strains
that originate from nosocomial patients and rhizosphere
niches, and to improve our general understanding of
what kinds of strategies have been adopted by the P.
aeruginosa genome in response to various environment
conditions, especially to different temperatures. In this
report, the complete genome of the strain M18 was
sequenced and compared with those of previously
sequenced nosocomial strains. Furthermore, the antimicrobial agent resistance in vitro and the competitive

Page 2 of 17

growth ability in a mouse model of acute lung infection
in vivo were investigated in the two strains of M18 and
LESB58. The temperature dependent genome expression
pattern based on the M18 genome was finally analyzed
at 28°C and 37°C.

Results and discussion
Strain M18 is an effective biological control agent

The strain M18 was isolated from the sweet melon rhizosphere that grew in Shanghai suburb in 1996, and
proved to have effective biocontrol activity to protect
plants against various phytopathogens infection [1]. In
this report, we first provide the evidence to show that
the secondary metabolites produced from the strain
M18 have strong effective inhibitory activity against the
growth of the Mycosphaerella melonis mycelium plug
on a potato dextrose agar (PDA) plate (Figure 1A) and
therapeutic anti-fungal effect on the sweat melon plant
with full recovery of the plant infected by the M. melonis fungus two days after the culture of 108 CFU/ml of
the strain M18 that was sprayed on the infected sweat
melon stem (Figure 1B and 1C). We have already found
that the strain M18 has a broad spectrum of anti-fungal
activities against various phytopathogens, including Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotina sclerotiorum, Fusarium oxysporum, Colletotrichum gossypii, Mycosphaerella
melonis, Phytophthora capsici, Ralstonia solanacearum
and others. The strain M18 also shows effective inhibiting activity against both the Gram-negative bacterium
Xanthomonas oryzae pv. Oryzae, and the Gram-positive
bacterium Bacillus cereus (data not shown). Therefore,
the unusual features of the strain M18 against various
fungal phytopathogens and bacteria prompted us to
sequence the complete genome of this strain to ascertain more about the genomic structures, with specific
reference to this expression pattern at different temperatures through analysis of microarray-based transcriptome profiles.
General genomic features and comparative analysis

The complete genome of the strain M18 was
sequenced and assembled as shown in Figure 2. A general comparison of the genomic features of the strain
M18 and other sequenced nosocomial P. aeruginosa
strains is shown in Table 1. The average GC content
of the M18 genome is 66.5%, which is remarkably
similar to the previously sequenced P. aeruginosa
strains PAO1, PA14, LESB58 and PA7. The genome of
the strain M18 is made of a single chromosome of
6,327,754 bp in size, which is slightly larger than the
6,264,404 bp of strain PAO1 [23], but relatively smaller
than the 6,537,648 bp of strain PA14 [24], 6,601,757
bp of LESB58 [14] and 6,588,339 bp of strain PA7
[25]. The M18 genome was annotated to contain 5,684

open reading frames (ORFs) and 80 RNA genes, which
represent 89% of the total genomic DNA. Using the
mGenomeSubtractor online software [28], we found
that the genome similarity among these five P. aeruginosa strains is very high; however 93 ORFs in the M18
genome, 109 ORFs in PAO1, 256 ORFs in PA14, 380
ORFs in LESB58 and 929 ORFs in PA7 are strain-specific under the threshold of 0.6 of identity or 0.7 of
match length/query length. The strain specific genes
contained in the M18 genome are listed in Additional
file 1. These results indicated that the available genomes of P. aeruginosa strains originating from both

Page 3 of 17

clinical and environmental sources contain a highly
conserved core genome in large than 90% of ORFs,
with several accessory regions in less than 10% of
ORFs remarkably varied depending on their different
environmental niches (except taxonomic outlier PA7).
Global alignments were performed by the MUMer
software [29], and the results showed that the large segment inversion of the chromosome by recombination
between the rrnA and rrnB genes was found in the M18
genome, as well as in other P. aeruginosa strains
LESB58, PA14 and PA7 (Figure 3B) in comparison with
that in PAO1 genome sequenced by the Seattle consortium [23]. Interestingly, the inversion also exists in different PAO1 sublines which are studied and stored in
German and American laboratories, and the phenotypes
among the PAO1 sublines are also different [30]. This
suggests that some physiological consequences occur
among the PAO1 sublines and other P. aeruginosa
strains because of the inversion [27].
The comparison of the M18 genome and the other
available P. aeruginosa genomes with regards to the
functional category breakdown of coding sequences
(CDSs) [31] shows a similar distribution in most groups,
but the two strains M18 and LESB58 show a greater
degree of similarity than others, including a similar
number of genes related to DNA replication, recombination and repair, the transport of inorganic ions and
amino acids, amino acid metabolism, and the biosynthesis, transport and catabolism of secondary metabolites
(Table 1). This suggests that the two strains share a
common ancestor as they have the closest relationship
in comparison with all other sequenced P. aeruginosa
strains. The phylogenetic tree was further generated by
maximum parsimony (MP) method, using 58 phylogenetic useful genes in P. aeruginosa [27]. The result confirmed that the strain M18 is the closest relative to
strain LESB58 among the sequence available P. aeruginosa strains, as shown in Figure 3A. We also found that
nine out of eleven O-antigen loci in the strain M18
share more than 95% similarity to the serotype O6 loci
in LESB58 [32], indicating that M18 may carry a similar
serotype O6 O-antigen. Based on these sequence data,
the strain M18 is now designated as P. aeruginosa M18,
a new isolate of P. aeruginosa.
Genomic islands and prophages

In comparison with other sequenced nosocomial P. aeruginosa genomes, the unique regions of genomic plasticity were predicted in the M18 genome, including five
specific genomic islands (GIs) designated MGI-I to V
and two novel prophages, I and II. The general features
of these GIs and prophages in the strain M18 are summarized in Figure 4A and Additional file 2. However,
we have not found homologies of the pathogenic islands

The strain-specific coding sequences (CDS) were predicted by proteins with low similarity to the other four sequenced P. aeruginosa strain genomes (under the
expected threshold of 0.6 for identity or 0.7 for match length/query length) using the mGenomeSubtractor [28].

against mammals such as PAPI-1 [33], PAPI-2 [34],
PAGI-5 [35], LESGI-5 [14], in the M18 genome.
To the best of our knowledge, the two GIs, MGI-I and
MGI-II are initially found in P. aeruginosa M18, and
share 38% identity with that in Pseudomonas putida
GB-1 and 55% with Nitrosomonas europaea ATCC
19718, respectively. The GC content of MGI-I (51.7%)
and MGI-II (55%) are quite lower than the average GC
content (66.5%) of the M18 genome. Difference in the
percentage of GC content between the GIs and the core
genome is considered as an important marker of horizontal gene transfer, suggesting that these two GIs are
associated with recently acquired genetic material. MGII contains two genes (PAM18_0699 and PAM18_0700)
that code for putative integrases, and MGI-II contains a
gene (PAM18_2243) that encodes a putative transposase. MGI-I contains another two genes, mod
(PAM18_0704) and res (PAM18_0705), which encode
two subunits of the type III restriction-modification
(RM) system. MGI-II contains another three genes,
hsdR (PAM18_2237), hsdM (PAM18_2238) and hsdS
(PAM18_2239) that code for all the three subunits in

the multifunctional type I RM system which quite differ
from the two type I RM systems in the PA7 genome.
These two restriction systems contained in a single M18
genome can be predicated to assist this strain in digesting foreign genetic material [36], which may explain
why P. aeruginosa M18 has proven to be recalcitrant to
the introduction of foreign DNA and to keep the strain
isolated from others within rhizosphere niches.
The GC content of MGI-III (65.6%) is similar to that
of the average content in the M18 genome. MGI-III
contains a plt synthetic gene cluster with its two flanking regulatory genes and transporter gene cluster
(pltMRLABCDEFGZHIJKNO) [37] and shares 99%
nucleotide sequence identity with the LESGI-2 sequence
in LESB58, suggesting that the two islands may originate
from the same genetic source and remain in the two
genomes. However, LESGI-2 contains a frameshift
mutation in pltB of the plt gene cluster [14]. The plt
synthetic gene cluster is inactivated in strain LESB58,
which might the result of the unnecessary Plt production in the nosocomial niche. However, Plt can be produced in the plant-associated pseudomonads such as

strain M18 [38] and P. fluorescens Pf-5 [39] and plays a
crucial anti-fungal function to suppress a variety of
plant diseases in rhizosphere niches.
The GC content of MGI-IV (63.1%) and MGI-V
(59.5%) is closer to the average content of the M18 genome than those of MGI-I and MGI-II, indicating that
the two islands may be not the recently acquired genetic

materials. A homologous sequence of MGI-IV was
found in P. aeruginosa PAK [40]. The MGI-IV contains
genes encoding acetyltransferase, 3-demethylubiquinone-9,3-methyltransferase, CMP-2-keto-3- deoxyoctulosonic acid synthetase, phenylpropionate dioxygenase,
ring-hydroxylating related dioxygenases, and nucleotide
sugar transaminase, which are involved in flagellar

glycosylation, secondary metabolite synthesis, and redox
reaction in the rhizosphere environment. The MGI-V is
a novel genomic island which has never been found in
other prokaryotic genomes. The gene (PAM18_5672) in
this island encodes a putative cytochrome P450, which
can catalyze the oxidation of several metabolic intermediates, such as lipids and steroidal hormones, as well
as xenobiotic substances, including drugs and other
toxic chemicals [41]. The two genomic islands in the
M18 genome may assist the strain M18 to utilize various substances and degrade environmental toxic materials and pollutants in the complex rhizosphere
environment.
Two novel prophages named prophage I and II were
found in the M18 genome. Each of the prophage contains a putative chitinase gene (PAM18_1344 and
PAM18_2447 [42]. Chitinase is a specific degradation
enzyme that breaks down glycoside bonds in chitin and
is essential for the degradation of chitin, a major component of the fungal cell wall. Besides the three copies
of capB gene in the M18 genome, an additional copy of
capB gene was identified in prophage II. The capB gene
is responsible for encoding a cold shock protein B involving in the adaptation to cold stress in the environment
[43]. The two chitinase genes and an additional capB
gene in the two prophages in the M18 genome suggest
that the strain M18 has developed its anti-fungal and
cold stress resistant genomic features under the strainspecific environmental selective pressures imposed on it.
Insertion sequence (IS) and clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)

A striking feature in the M18 genome is the least number and diversity of 3 IS elements named IS222 (1,227
bp), ISPa32 (1,232 bp) and ISPa6 (1,316 bp) as shown in
Figure 4B). However, the other completely sequenced P.
aeruginosa strains, PAO1, PA14, PA7, and LESB58 carry
12, 10, 15 and 8 IS elements, respectively (Table 1). To
our knowledge, the IS elements are postulated to be
important drivers of many bacterial genome evolution,
such as Xanthomonas [44]. In addition to serving as vectors for lateral gene transfer, IS elements can generate
other types of genome modification, including rearrangements, inversions and deletions, any of which can
increase the instability of the bacterial genome. Therefore, the least number of IS elements in the genome
indicates the relative genome stability of the strain M18
in the rhizosphere niches.
As predicted by the CRISPRFinder [45], three CRISPR
elements were found in the M18 genome (Figure 4B).
CRISPR 1 element is 987 bp in length and has 16
spacers each flanked by a 28 bp direct repeat (DR).
There is one single similar CRISPR element in the
LESB58 genome, in which six spacers are different from

Page 8 of 17

the CRISPR 1 element. The CRISPR 2 element consists
of 866 bp with 14 spacers each flanked by 28 bp DR,
and the CRISPR3 is 687 bp in length with 11 spacers
and 28 bp DR. The CRISPR 2 and 3 sequences are similar to those in the PA14 genome, which only has the
two homologies. Furthermore, most of spacers in the
CRISPR 2 and 3 elements are quite different from those
in other P. aeruginosa strains. The strains PAO1 and
PA7 only carry some questionable CRISPR elements
that have borderline sequence identity. The three
CRISPR elements in the M18 genome can be found dispersedly in other sequenced P. aeruginosa genomes,
indicating that the M18 genome contains the most
number of CRISPR elements among the five available
complete P. aeruginosa genomes. The different spacer
sequences in the three CRISPR loci of the strain M18
indicate that M18 has developed specific features to
combat various phage invasions in the rhizosphere
environment, as spacer sequences are known to be critical for bacteria to resist foreign phage invasion [46,47].
Biocontrol-related gene clusters with their products

We identified six secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene
clusters, which are related to biocontrol activities of the
strain M18, and responsible for biosynthesis of two siderophores, hydrogen cyanide, Plt and PCA (Additional
file 3). Among them, two gene clusters are responsible
for the biosynthesis of two siderophores, including pyoverdine (Pvd) and pyochelin (Pch), respectively, which
have been demonstrated to suppress target phytopathogens in the rhizosphere through iron competition [48].
The hcn cluster responsible for the production of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is highly conserved in different P.
aeruginosa strains. The Plt biosynthesis gene cluster is
located in MGI-III and has been described above. The
remaining two gene clusters are responsible for PCA
biosynthesis. The two phz gene clusters in the genome
of the strain M18 are highly conserved and share 99%
homologous sequences to those in the P. aeruginosa
PAO1, each of which consists of seven genes
(phzA1B1C1D1E1F1G1 and phzA2B2C2D2E2F2G2),
named phzA1-G1 and phzA2-G2, respectively [49]. The
genes that flank these two clusters are also the same to
those of P. aeruginosa PAO1. However, there is a 520
bp intergenic region located directly downstream of the
phzA2-G2 gene cluster between the phzG2 gene and the
ORF (PAM18_3137) in the strain M18, compared to a
shorter 96 bp sequence in the strain PAO1 and a relatively longer 286 bp sequence in the LESB58 genome.
All these interval regions are consisted of clustered
short repeats, although their function remains unknown.
The predominant phenazine produced in strain M18
is PCA, especially at 28°C, rather than PYO produced in
other nosocomial originating P. aeruginosa strains [11].

Both PCA and Plt compounds produced by fluorescent
Pseudomonas species are considered to play an important role in microbial competitiveness and combating
plant pathogens [50]. To our knowledge, the strain M18
is the first strain that was reported to produce both
PCA and Plt simultaneously, and the synergistic antibiotic effect of PCA and Plt can result in strong activity to
protect plants from fungal phytopathogen infections. It
has been found that the wild-type strain M18 has much
greater effective inhibitory activity against various mycelium plug growths than either the single PCA or Plt null
mutants on the PDA plate (data not shown). We purified the two compounds of PCA and Plt individually
from liquid culture, and measured the antifungal activities of the single compound and the combinations of
various weight ratios of the two compounds against Rhizoctonia solani mycelium plug growth on PDA plates,
respectively. The 50% value of efficient control (EC50) is
8.38 and 58.13 μg/ml for single PCA and Plt, respectively. However, the EC50 of the two compound combination at a weight ratio of 10 to 1 at pH 7.0 drops to
0.74 μg/ml only, indicating a significant synergistic effect
of PCA and Plt combination on fungal inhibition. The
combinations of the two antibiotics may play a crucial
role for the strain M18 to protect the plant against different phytopathogen infections.
Virulence-related genes against mammals

Besides the virulence related genes located in the accessory genome, the LESB58 genome contains all of the

257 genes described for PAO1 with the exception of
PA2399 (pvdD) and PA1392 [14]. Based on the VFDB
database [51], we found that 14 out of 255 virulence
genes in the M18 genome are quite different from those
of LESB58 after BLASTP searching (Table 2). Firstly, six
genes in the M18 genome (i.e., flgL, fliC, flaG, fliD, fliS
and fliT) share less than 70% identity with the genes in
LESB58, which are involved in the synthesis of flagellum
components and related to bacterial motility and biofilm
formation. Furthermore, the flagellum of the strain
LESB58 belongs to a member of b-type because it lacks
flagellar glycosylation, and the flagellum of the strain
M18 may belong to the a-type resulted by the flagellar
glycosylation function of MGI-IV in the M18 genome.
These differences may give rise to different ability of
bacterial biofilm formation and induce different mammalian immune system between the two strains. Secondly, five out of 42 pyoverdine synthesis-associated
genes, which are involved in the iron uptake and cytotoxic due to its ability to stimulate the production of
reactive oxygen species [52], are quite different between
the two strains. The gene pvdS (PALES28681) is completely absent in the M18 genome. Notably, there are
three copies of fpvA (encoding the first ferric pyoverdine
receptor) and pvdE (encoding an ABC transporter) in
the LESB58 genome [14], but only one copy of fpvA
(PAM18_2643) and pvdE (PAM18_2644) in the M18
genome; the two genes have only 24.9% and 57.7%
sequence identity, respectively, to those in LESB58.
Furthermore, pvdD (PAM18_2640) and pvdJ

(PAM18_2641), which are predicted to encode the nonribosomal peptide synthetase in the pyoverdine synthesis
pathway, have only 57.2% and 53.4% sequence identity
to those in LESB58, respectively.
In the LESB58 genome, the ppkA gene (PALES-00751)
codes a positive regulator of type VI secretion system
[53], and the gene lecA (PALES-27241) codes a factor
which plays an important role in biofilm formation and
adherence to mammalian cells [54]. However, both of
the two homologous ppkA and lecA OFRs
(PAM18_2466 and PAM18_0076) in M18 genome are
truncated because of a stop codon located in the middle
of the two ORFs.
The M18 genome carries a gene cluster responsible
for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen serotype O6 biosynthesis [32], which shares larger than 90% identity
with that in LESB58. Interestingly, the gmd gene within
the LPS biosynthesis gene cluster coding for GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase is a pseudogene in the LESB58
genome [14]. However, the gmd gene (PAM18_5576)
was found to be a true gene in the M18 genome,
although the association with the virulence and O-antigen deficiency remains unclear.
Attenuated competitive activity of the strain M18 in a
mouse model of acute lung infection

The different genome structures, especially the different
mammalian virulence related genes, prompted us to
make a comparison of the infectious activities between
the two closely related strains M18 and LESB58 in a
mammal model in vivo. Thus, we measured the competitive index (CI) of the paired strains to assess their different ability in growth and maintenance in an acute
mouse lung infection model (Figure 5). Equal ratio of
the two strains was adjusted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and the mixture was inoculated into the
mouse lung via the nostril. Bacteria were enumerated in
the lung tissue at 24 h and 48 h post-infection. The geometric mean CI values were 0.3909 and 0.1695, respectively. The results showed that the strain M18 was
easier to be erased than the strain LESB58 in all of the
10 tested mice, and the growth and maintenance abilities of the M18 strain were more attenuated after a
prolonged duration of inoculation than LESB58. The
preliminary results indicated that the strain LESB58 is
more difficult to be erased than the strain M18 in the
acute mouse lung infection mode. Further experiments
are now being carried out in this laboratory to elucidate
the virulence activities of the strain M18 against humans
and animal cell lines, and to identify the relationship
between the virulence gene expression profiles of the
M18 genome in the mouse lung and the responses of
mammalian immune system.

M18 in comparison to the strain LESB58 divided by the CFU input
ratio of the mixed suspension of both strains. Each circle represents
the CI for a single animal in each group. The CI of less than 1
indicates a defect in growth and maintaince of the strain M18 in
vivo than the strain LESB58. The geometric mean of the CIs for all
mice is shown as a solid line.

Antimicrobial agent resistance spectrum

The minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of antimicrobial agents against the two strains M18 and LESB58
were listed in Table 3. The strain M18 is phenotypically
resistant to several antimicrobial agents including penicillins, cephalosporins, chloramphenicol, aminoglycosides and macrolides, which is the same as the reported
P. aeruginosa strains [55]. The genomic analysis indicated that the strain M18 carries a b-lactamase gene
ampC (PAM18_0829) and other eight putative b-lactamase genes (i.e., PAM18_0058, PAM18_1371,
PAM18_2047,
PAM18_2725,
PAM18_3247,
PAM18_4437, PAM18_5635, and PAM18_5664), which
are responsible for encoding enzymes resistant to b-lactam antibiotics [56,57]. Furthermore, the M18 genome
contains several gene clusters encoding proteins to constitute efflux pumps, such as mexAB-oprM
(PAM18_0425-PAM18_0427) [58], mexCD-oprJ
(PAM18_4693-PAM18_4691) [59], and mexEF-oprN
(PAM18_2546-PAM18_2544) [60], which result in resistance to many antimicrobial agents including chloramphenicol, aminoglycoside, macrolides and rifampicin.
Except the aztreonam, the strain M18 is susceptible to
most of the clinically applied antimicrobial agents
against P. aeruginosa, including third-generation cephalosporins (ceftazidime, ceftriaxone), carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem), monobactam (aztreonam),

polymyxin (colistin) and tobramycin. However, comparing with the strain LESB58, the strain M18 is slightly
more susceptible to imipenem and meropenem.
Interestingly, compared with P. aeruginosa LESB58,
the strain M18 is more susceptible to several antimicrobial agents, such as gentamycin, kanamycin and ofloxacin. Quinolone resistance is usually present in P.
aeruginosa strains because of two point mutations in
gyrA and parC in the genome, respectively [61]. The
lack of the two point mutations in the M18 genome can
be postulated to responsible for quinolone susceptibility
of the strain M18. Therefore, the results suggest that
the rhizosphere isolate M18 has not evolved specific
mechanisms including point mutation or acquisition
resistant plasmid to resist antimicrobial agents, unlike
nosocomial P. aeruginosa strains that face lethal antimicrobial agents stress.
Genomic microarray based transcriptome analysis

Measurement of gene expression levels at two temperatures, 28°C and 37°C, was performed using an oligonucleotide Agilent microarray based on the M18 genome
sequence to specify the temperature-dependent expression profiles of this strain. We selected 28°C as a temperature representative for the rhizosphere niches and
37°C for the human body. The results from the temperature-dependent transcriptome analysis were

consistent with our previously published data that the
expression of phzM, ptsP and lasI gene is up-regulated
at 37°C [11]. The comparative analysis of the M18 genome expressional profiles at 28°C and 37°C indicated
that the expression levels of a total of 605 genes at 28°C
are regulated over two-fold that at 37°C. It shows that a
total of 10.6% of the expressed genes in M18 genome
are temperature-dependent (Additional file 4).
In comparison with gene expression level at 37°C, the
transcriptional expression levels of 277 genes are upregulated by approximately two-fold at 28°C, including
151 genes with known functions and 126 functions
unknown genes. Among these, 77 function known genes
are sorted into nine gene families (Table 4). Surprisingly,
24 of these genes are contained in the M18 GIs and
prophage, of which eight genes are located in prophage
I, two genes are involved in the type I restriction-modification system in MGI-II, seven genes are related to the
pyoluteorin transporter in MGI-III, and seven genes in
MGI-V are associated with the synthesis of cytochrome
P450. We also found that other up-regulated operons
are involved in energy production and the conversion of
TCA cycle-related oxidative phosphorylation, aromatic
amino acid and benzonate degradation, and phosphate
uptake. Besides the operons, a potential phenazine modifying enzyme, phzH, a gene that encoded quorum sensing (QS) signal molecule N-butanoyl-L-homoserine
lactone synthetase, rhlI, and a gene that encoded the QS
repressor, qscR, are promoted at 28°C. The other genes,
which are not located in these operons, could be
assigned to various functions, including phage-related,
FeS cluster assembly, glyoxylate metabolism, benzonate
degradation, copper resistance, and pentose phosphate.
Hence, the expression levels of these genes involved in
antibiotics production, foreign genetic material prevention and nutrient substance degradation are up-regulated at the rhizosphere temperature 28°C, which may
give M18 an advantage to resistance the rhizosphere
environmental stresses.
In comparison with the gene expression levels at 37°C,
a total of 328 gene expression levels are down-regulated
by approximately two-fold at 28°C; 53 of these genes
have unknown functions, and 189 function known genes
are sorted into 19 gene families (Table 4), such as the
secretion system, transportation, and ribosomal assembly and etc. These results indicated that the basic protein synthesis, metabolism rate and cell growth rate
decrease at the low temperature of 28°C compared to
37°C. Strikingly, none of them is located in M18 GIs or
prophages. Interestingly, we found that the 16 downregulated genes are predicted to encode several mammalian virulence-related factors, including three genes
predicated to encode HCN synthetase, three encode
proteins involved in type II secretion system, eight genes

involved in the type III secretion system, and two genes

Transcriptome profile analysis based on the M18
genomic microarray at the two different temperatures
implies that the M18 genome has developed its specific
features for gene expression to meet the requirement

for the competitive fitness and survival in rhizosphere
niches except the specific genome structure features.

Conclusions
The strain M18 isolated from the sweet melon rhizosphere in 1996 in Shanghai suburb was named Pseudomonas sp. M18 because of its effective biocontrol ability

Wu et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:438
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/438

and several phenotypic features that are similar to Pseudomonas spp. [1,2,11]. In this study, the complete genome of the strain M18 was sequenced and shown to
share a common core genome that is comprised of
more than 90% genome sequence homology to all other
sequenced genomes of P. aeruginosa isolates (except
taxonomic outlier PA7). Based on the comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis of the M18 genome with
other P. aeruginosa, the strain M18 can now be definitively designated as a new P. aeruginosa strain. The
results indicated that the core genome diversity of various P. aeruginosa strains from either nosocomial or rhizosphere niche is quite small in comparison with that of
various P. fluorescens strains [62].
However, the various P. aeruginosa strains originating
from different environment niches differ in accessory
genome regions, genome expression profiles, virulence
activities and antibiotic resistances. The analysis of complete M18 genome sequence and temperature dependent
transcriptional profiles indicated several important features distinguished the strain M18 from other nosocomial P. aeruginosa strains. Firstly, the M18 genome
contains several specific accessory regions of genomic
plasticity which differ significantly from all sequenced
nosocomial isolates. This is the first time to sequence
completely a rhizosphere originating P. aeruginosa strain
M18, and take it as a model strain to analysis and detail
the possible determinants related to its biocontrol activity and living ability in rhizosphere niche. We found
that the M18 genome contains five specific GIs and two
novel prophages, which benefit its survival and biocontrol activity in the rhizosphere niches. Furthermore, all
mammalian pathogenicity-related GIs and prophages
contained in other sequenced P. aeruginosa strains
[14,33-35] are absent in M18 genome. Secondly, fourteen mammalian virulence-related genes are absent or
truncated in M18 genome, and the competitive index
analysis of the strains M18 and LESB58 indicated the
strain M18 is easier to be erased than that of LESB58 in
the acute infection mouse lung model. Comparing with
the strain LESB58, the strain M18 is more susceptible to
several antibiotics and antimicrobial agents including
kanamycin, gentamycin and ofloxacin. Thirdly, the M18
genome based microarray profiles revealed that the
strain M18 has developed its specific temperaturedependent gene expression patterns to meet the requirements of survival and thriving in the rhizosphere niche.
Especially, we found that none in the GIs expressed
higher at 37°C than that at 28°C, but 24 genes in the
GIs and prophages are up-regulated at 28°C which is
the temperature close to that in rhizosphere niches.
In summary, the rhizosphere originated strain M18
has evolved specific genome structures and the

Page 13 of 17

temperature dependent expressional patterns to meet
the requirement of fitness and survival under the selective pressure imposed on it. Therefore, the specific
interesting features found in M18 genome and transcriptome profiles may provide us several cues to design
therapeutic strategies against P. aeruginosa infection,
and assist us to develop the strain M18 or other rhizosphere originating strains as a safety cell factory for the
industrial purposes to produce antifungal compounds or
other secondary metabolites through genetically engineered modification.

Methods
Bacterial strains, medium, and growth conditions

P. aeruginosa M18 was isolated from sweet melon rhizosphere in Shanghai suburb in 1996 and maintained in
our laboratory. P. aeruginosa LESB58 which is a hypervirulent strain isolated from CF patient [63], was
obtained from Dr. Robert E.W. Hancock. The two
strains were typically grown in Luria Bertani (LB) medium at 28°C and 37°C, respectively.
Genome sequencing

The draft P. aeruginosa M18 genome sequence was
obtained using GS 20 system (454 Life Science Corporation). Overall, 547,645 high-quality reads were
assembled and had an average length that covered 32.9fold of the genome, and yielded 227 contigs with the
454 assembly tool. Among these, 172 large contigs (>
500 bp) represented 99.18% of the draft sequence. The
complete sequence was assembled and finished according to the method described by Zhang [64], and the
average error rate of the finished genome was lower
than 1 bp in 10 kb.
Nucleotide sequence accession number

The annotated genome sequence has been deposited
into GenBank under accession no. CP002496.
Genome annotation

Genome annotation of the strain M18 was mainly performed as described previously [64]. In brief, putative
coding sequences (CDS) were predicted using Glimmer
3 [65], and the short CDS (< 90 bp) were eliminated.
The putative protein function were predicted using
BLASTP searches against all the annotated proteins of
the P. aeruginosa strains, LESB58, PAO1, UCBPP-PA14
and PA7, and the nr (non-redundant protein sequences)
database in NCBI based on the most significant
matches. Clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) and
subcellular localizations for each CDS were predicted
using RPS-BLAST [66], PSORTb v.2.0 [67] and LipoP1.0
[68]. Transfer RNAs were predicted by TRNASCAN-SE

Wu et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:438
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/438

[69]. Ribosomal RNAs and small RNAs were predicted
by BLASTN searches against those of P. aeruginosa
strains, LESB58, PAO1, UCBPP-PA14 and PA7. ISs
were identified by the IS Finder database http://www-is.
biotoul.fr/, and CRISPRs were predicted by CRISPRFinder [45].
Comparative genomics

The P. aeruginosa M18 genome sequence was aligned to
those of other sequenced P. aeruginosa genomes currently at NCBI with the use of MUMmer [29]. The M18
strain-specific CDS were identified with mGenomeSubtractor [28] with 75% identities, or 70% length ratios of
matching regions to questionable CDSs.
Phylogenetic analysis

Nine completely sequenced P. aeruginosa genomes were
selected to assess the phylogenetic status of M18, while
P. fluorescens Pf-5 was used as a member of the “out”
group. A total of 58 phylogenetically useful genes [27]
which carried more than 10 parsimony informative sites,
were selected to construct the phylogenetic tree. Then,
the nucleotide sequences of 58 PUG genes in these
strains were connected, aligned, and constructed to
form a maximum parsimony tree using MEGA 4 software [70].
Genomic island identification

GIs and prophages located in the 3’-end of the annotated tRNA genes were firstly identified using MobilomeFINDER [71]. GIs located in the other sites of M18
genome were identified by mGenomeSubtractor [28].
The large islands that contained more than five CDS
were kept. The direct repeat (DR) elements were identified using BLASTN searches. Prophages were identified
by manual inspection of phage-related genes.
Fungal growth inhibition assay

Fungal growth inhibition by P. aeruginosa strain M18
was determined by measuring its ability to inhibit the
growth of a plug of Mycosphaerella melonis mycelium
on a potato dextrose agar plate (PDA). Briefly, a plug in
5-mm diameter from the leading edge of M. melonis
culture grown for 5 days at 28°C on a PDA plate was
taken and placed in the center of a fresh PDA plate.
The strain M18 cultures grown overnight on a King’s
medium B (KMB) plate were placed at the position 25
mm away from the mycelium plug on PDA plate. The
co-culture plates were incubated at 28°C and scored
after 4 or 5 days by measuring the distance between the
edges of the bacterial colony and the fungal mycelium
plug [72]. Each experiment was repeated twice with
three replicates.

Competitive index analysis in mouse

The acute lung infection mouse model has been previously described [73]. Five mice were used for each
experiment. According to the guidelines of ethics committee for animal treatment, adult female BALB/c mice
that weighted more than 17 g at the age of 6- to 8weeks-old were used. The animals were anesthetized
using 2.5% avertin by intraperitoneal administration.
The bacteria were centrifuged and washed twice with
PBS, and the final concentration was adjusted to
approximately 1 × 108 CFU/ml. Equal ratio of the culture of the two strains M18 and LESB58 was mixed for
inoculation. With the mice held in an upright position,
10 μl of the bacterial mixture was inoculated twice (20
μl in total) into mice via application into the nostril
with a pipette. Mice were sacrificed at 24 h and 48 h
post-inoculation and their lungs were used for CFU
counts based on the significant colony size differences
of the two strains on LB plates, as the colony diameter
of M18 colony and LESB58 is 1-2 mm and 0.2-0.5 mm
in size after overnight culture, respectively. The two different strain colonies were further verified by colony
PCR using phzG2 interval region primer, and the PCR
products of M18 and LESB58 colonies are 1075 bp and
841 bp in length, respectively. The pair of primer
sequences is designed as phzG2Iup: ACTGACACTGAGGTGCGAAAGCG;
phzG2Idown:
ACCGTATGCGCTTCACTTGACC. The M18/LESB58
CIs in vivo were determined according to the method
previously described [73].
Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) Determination

The MIC determination method was applied to measure
the susceptibility of the two strains of P. aeruginosa
M18 and LESB58 to a range of antimicrobial agents, as
previously described [25]. For each antimicrobial agent,
a serial of two-fold diluted agent was generated using an
appropriate starting concentration in Müller-hinton
broth media. The MIC corresponds to the smallest
agent concentration that inhibits the growth of P. aeruginosa M18 and LESB58.
Oligonucleotide microarray experiments

The P. aeruginosa M18-specific Agilent Oligonucleotide
microarray (Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) Platform:
GPL11372) was designed with the eArray software. For
each of 5,684 annotated CDS, a 60-mer oligonucleotide
was designed and repeated twice on the microarray. The
P. aeruginosa strain M18 was cultured overnight in LB
medium with 180 rpm at 28°C and 37°C, respectively.
The two cultures were inoculated by 100-fold diluted
into LB medium for three biological replicates and
grown to OD600 ~5.0-6.0. The total RNA was extracted

Wu et al. BMC Genomics 2011, 12:438
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/12/438

using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and measured with a BioAnalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Total
RNA was eluted in RNase-free water and purified by
QIAGEN RNeasy kit. A total of 2 μg RNA was reversetranscribed to cDNA by a one-step method. The cDNA
was transcribed into RNA by T7 RNA polymerase, modified by aa-UTP at 40°C, before labeling with Cy3 fluorescence dye at 25°C, purified by a QIAGEN RNeasy
mini kit, and quantified by the BioAnalyzer. After hybridization, the arrays were washed according to the manufacturer instructions and scanned twice by an Agilent
scanner at 100% and 10% photo multiplier tube (PMT).
The normalized data was analyzed using an R script
[74]. Expression levels of the genes were compared
using SBC analysis system (http://sas.ebioservice.com/).
Average values of each gene were calculated based on
the three biological replicates.
Oligonucleotide microarray data accession number

The microarray data has been deposited in to GEO
under accession no. GSE26518.
