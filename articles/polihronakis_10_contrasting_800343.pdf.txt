Contrasting patterns of phylogeographic
relationships in sympatric sister species of ironclad
beetles (Zopheridae: Phloeodes spp.) in California's
Transverse Ranges

Abstract
Background: Comparative phylogeography of sympatric sibling species provides an opportunity to isolate the effects
of geography and demographics on the evolutionary history of two lineages over the same, known time scale. In the
current study, we investigated the phylogeographic structure of two zopherid beetle species, Phloeodes diabolicus and
P. plicatus, where their ranges overlap in California's Transverse Ranges.
Results: Although P. diabolicus and P. plicatus share similar habitats with largely overlapping distributions, the results of
this study revealed different evolutionary histories for each species since divergence from their most recent common
ancestor. In general, P. plicatus had higher genetic diversity, and more among population isolation than P. diabolicus.
The mismatch distributions indicated that one major difference between the two species was the timing of population
expansion. This result was consistent with genetic patterns revealed by the Φst values and genetic diversity. Lastly, there
were no parallel genetic breaks at similar geographic barriers between the species.
Conclusions: Our data revealed that differential demographics rather than geography were responsible for the
genetic patterns of the two species.
Background
Phylogeographic studies seek to understand how current
and historical habitat dynamics influence lineage divergence and species diversity patterns. Integrating data
from multiple species in a specific region makes it possible to assess trends in the data that help identify largescale phenomena that contribute to regional species
diversity patterns [1,2]. However, comparing phylogeographic structure across many disparate species introduces many spatio-temporal and life history variables
that are difficult to accommodate. For example, whether
multiple species exhibit parallel genetic patterns is
dependent on factors such as dispersal ability and the
timing of population divergence [3]. One way to address
these discrepancies and isolate the factors affecting current distribution patterns is to study sympatric sibling

species [4]. Comparing sympatric sister species provides
a means to directly compare the evolutionary history of
two lineages on a known relative time scale. Such comparisons provide a basis to tease apart the role of general
phenomena such as phylogeographic barriers versus species-specific natural history traits and demographic variables in extant patterns of diversity.
The current study uses multi-locus sequence data to
reconstruct the evolutionary history of two species of
ironclad beetle (family Zopheridae), Phloeodes diabolicus
(LeConte) and Phloeodes plicatus (LeConte). Due to
recent changes in the higher level classification of the
family involving the focal taxa of the current study, we
follow the work of Foley and Ivie [5] and recognize the
distinction of the genus Phloeodes from Nosoderma and
Noserus whose synonymy was proposed by García-París
et al. [6]. The dynamic taxonomic history of beetles in the
family Zopheridae in part reflects the variability of the
morphological characters used by various authors to

diagnose species, such as the degree of elytral sculpturing
and texture. In 1907, the variation observed in this group
led Casey [7] to describe six species that have since been
synonymized with Phloeodes diabolicus [5,8], and four
species that have been synonymized with Phloeodes plicatus [5]. This high level of morphological variation in
combination with an unstable taxonomic history suggests
an interesting evolutionary story for these beetles that we
investigate using genetic data.
Phloeodes diabolicus and P. plicatus are two of three
species in this genus and are hypothesized to be sister
taxa relative to the third species, P. venustus, found in
Central America [5]. Both species are broadly distributed
in the California Floristic Province, are flightless, and can
be found under bark feeding on fungus in dead hardwood
and coniferous trees. Phloeodes diabolicus is found as far
north as Mt. Shasta (near the California/Oregon border),
and into both the northern and southern Sierra Nevada
Mts. On the other hand, the distribution of P. plicatus is
limited to the coastal ranges of California and the southern Sierra Nevada Mts. Nevertheless, large portions of
their range do overlap, and individuals of the two species
are often found in microsympatry (sometimes under the
bark of the same tree). Thus, the first goal of this study
was to determine whether these two lineages are reproductively isolated or if there has been gene flow in the
parts of their range where they overlap. We then examined the genetic patterns associated with the broad distribution of P. diabolicus in comparison with the relatively
restricted distribution of P. plicatus. Specifically, we compared historical demography, phylogeographic structure,
genetic diversity, and tested whether the species exhibited genetic breaks at similar biogeographic barriers.

Results
Our sampling effort yielded 53 specimens of Phloeodes
diabolicus, and 36 specimens of Phloeodes plicatus (Figure 1). Amplification of the latter half of COI included
824 base pairs, of which 50 were variable and 25 were
parsimony informative in P. diabolicus; and 99 variable
with 61 parsimony informative in P. plicatus (GenBank
accessions HM026069-HM026125; Additional File 1).
This variation resulted in 26 different P. diabolicus haplotypes and 31 different P. plicatus haplotypes. For the 762
base pair portion of the CAD gene amplified, there were
18 variable and 7 parsimony informative sites in P. diabolicus; and 47 variable and 42 parsimony informative
sites in P. plicatus (GenBank accessions HM026126HM026169; Additional File 1). Of the 28 P. diabolicus
individuals for which CAD was amplified, 12 were
heterozygous yielding a total of 16 haplotypes. For P. plicatus, 16 of 20 individuals were heterozygous at the CAD
locus and yielded a total of 28 haplotypes. Thus, for both
genes amplified, P. plicatus had smaller sample sizes but

Page 2 of 11

more variable sites and more unique haplotypes than P.
diabolicus.
The gametic phase of heterozygous individuals was
inferred using the program Phase v2.1 [9,10]. There were
several individuals from both species that had one or two
positions that could not be determined with probability
>0.95 and so these positions were coded using the IUPAC
ambiguity codes. There was no statistically significant
evidence for recombination in the CAD gene (p = 0.68) in
P. diabolicus, but there was in P. plicatus (p = 0.00).
Because recombination violates the assumption of a
bifurcating tree structure inherent to all phylogenetic
methods, we interpreted CAD haplotype relationships
inferred through network analysis because it allows for
reticulation and reflects recombination by the presence
of loops [11].
Phylogenetic and Network Analyses

The COI gene tree from MrBayes had strong support for
the monophyly of both P. diabolicus and P. plicatus (Figure 2). There was also support for smaller subgroups
within each of these lineages, but relationships among
these were largely unresolved and resulted in large polytomies. Within the P. diabolicus lineage, TCS resolved
two separate haplotype networks, a small one comprising
five haplotypes from relatively arid localities in the southern Peninsular Range and San Bernardino Mts., and the
other with 21 haplotypes from the northern Peninsular
and Transverse Ranges (Figure 3a). These two networks
overlapped in the eastern Transverse Ranges (San Bernardino Mts.) as a result of one haplotype from Willow
Creek (diM12) in the smaller network while all other haplotypes from Willow Creek (diM13-diM16) were in the
larger network. Within the larger haplotype group, there
were three small subgroups that showed weak geographic
congruence. The first cluster included the most frequent
P. diabolicus haplotype (diM01), which was closely
related to haplotypes diM06, diM10, and diM11 that only
occurred in the western Transverse and Santa Lucia
Mountain ranges. The second cluster within this large
group (diM05, diM14, diM18, and diM19) was found
from localities in both the western and eastern portions
of Transverse Ranges. The third cluster (diM16 and
diM21) was found only in the eastern Transverse Ranges
(San Gabriel and San Bernardino Mts.). The remaining
haplotypes were unstructured and did not form distinct
clusters from any particular geographic area.
In addition to higher haplotype diversity, P. plicatus
mitochondrial haplotypes had more phylogenetic structure and geographic concordance, although few populations were resolved as monophyletic. The TCS haplotype
network consisted of one large network and two disconnected singleton haplotypes (plM20 and plM31 from the
northern Santa Lucia Mts and Santa Catalina Island,

respectively) (Figure 3b). In the Bayesian gene tree, well
supported clades distinguished haplotypes from the San
Gabriel Mts. (plM22 - plM24 and plM27 - plM29), San
Jacinto Mts. (plM09 - plM11), and Santa Cruz Island
(plM05 and plM06) (Figure 2). One moderately well supported clade (pp = 0.87) joined haplotypes from the
southern Santa Lucia Mts. (plM01 and plM18) with the
one from Santa Catalina Island (plM31). Other clades
with moderate support included some, but not all, haplotypes found in the Santa Ynez and Sierra Pelona ranges.
Larger-scale patterns of relationship among regions were
not evident.
The TCS network analysis based on the CAD data
resulted in two networks corresponding to each of the
two species. Haplotypes in the P. diabolicus network were
closely related with few missing haplotypes and minimal
geographic coherence (Figure 3c). Although not as highly

divergent or exclusive as in the COI network, haplotypes
in the southern areas were closely related, and exhibited
high haplotype diversity relative to the number of individuals sampled (diN03-05, 11-13). However, this was not
perfectly congruent with the COI results in several
respects: 1) the Peninsular ranges exhibited no northsouth split, 2) two (but not all) of the haplotypes from the
San Gabriel Mts. were close to southern haplotypes, and
3) the Santa Monica Mts. haplotypes showed closer relationships to southern haplotypes than to northern ones.
Diversity in the more northern areas (Santa Ynez Mts.,
northwestern Transverse Ranges, and Santa Lucia Mts.)
was relatively low, especially considering the level of sampling in those areas.
On the other hand, CAD haplotypes in the P. plicatus
network exhibited high diversity among individuals with
many missing haplotypes, but were all connected in one

network (Figure 3d). There was some geographic structure, as revealed by relatively close relationships of haplotypes from the northern and southern Santa Lucia Mts.,
Santa Ynez Mts., central Transverse Ranges, and the
Santa Monica Mts. The eastern Transverse Range haplotypes (San Gabriel and San Jacinto Mts., as sampled for
this species) were clustered in two separate groups; however, each had a surprising inclusion. One of these groups
included all haplotypes from Santa Cruz Island (plN05plN08), and the other contained one haplotype from the
Santa Ynez Mts. (plN11). All other Santa Ynez Mts. hap-

lotypes were in a lineage containing haplotypes from the
northern and southern Santa Lucia Mts., central Transverse Ranges, and Santa Monica Mts.
In general, the results of the Φst analysis illustrated that
there was less structure among P. diabolicus populations
than P. plicatus populations. However, significance of
pairwise Φst values varied for the two loci within each
species (Tables 1 &2). For example, in P. diabolicus, the
Φst value between the geographically proximate Santa
Ynez Mts. and northwest Transverse Ranges was significant in analyses of COI data, but not based on CAD.

Values for COI below diagonal, values for CAD above. Bold indicates significance at p < 0.05; asterisks represent cases where there was not
enough data.

These discrepancies could result from the low number of
CAD haplotypes in the P. diabolicus data set, especially
within certain populations such as the northwest Transverse Ranges which only had two different haplotypes.
The geographic structure differed in the two species
based on the two-group AMOVA, as would be expected
based on the phylogenetic and network analyses. In both
species the highest percentage of variation based on the
CAD gene came from high heterozygosity (within individual variation), regardless of group assignments (Table
3). In P. diabolicus within-population diversity greatly
exceeded among-population or among-group diversity,
regardless of which group populations were assigned to.
In P. plicatus, the largest percentage of variation of the
COI gene was among populations; however, AMOVA
results for P. plicatus based on the CAD gene were
dependent on how populations were assigned to the two
groups. In sum, P. diabolicus exhibited less geographic
structure than P. plicatus due to the fact that most of the
genetic variation of P. diabolicus was represented within

populations, while that of P. plicatus was mostly among
populations (Table 3).
When north-south populations were assigned to one of
two groups in succession, the two species exhibited different geographic breaks (Table 3). In P. diabolicus, both
genes had the highest among group variation when the
southern populations (San Bernardino and Peninsular
Ranges) were separated from all other populations (Fct =
32% (COI) & 26% (CAD). In P. plicatus, the among group
variation based on the COI gene was very low with the
highest being 12.5% (Santa Ynez Mts./Sierra Pelona + San
Gabriel Mts./San Jacinto Mts.); however, among group
variation based on the CAD gene was highest (Fct = 30%)
when the northern population from the Santa Ynez Mts.
was separated from the more eastern and southerly
regions (Sierra Pelona, San Gabriel Mts., and San Jacinto
Mts.).
The mismatch distributions revealed distinct demographic histories for each species (Figure 4). While both
distributions were unimodal (non-significant Harpending's raggedness index: P. diabolicus, p = 0.67 and P. plica-

tus, p = 0.85), the mode for P. diabolicus was
approximately four pairwise differences while the mode
for P. plicatus was approximately 20 pairwise differences.
This difference was reflected in the estimates of τ, which
showed that the time of expansion for P. diabolicus (τ =
4.7; 95% confidence interval 1.8 - 7.2) was much more
recent than for P. plicatus (τ = 19.1; 95% confidence interval 13.4 - 23.0).

Discussion
Phylogeographic investigation of P. diabolicus and P. plicatus allowed us to directly compare the evolutionary
history of each species and identify the extent to which
each was affected by geography. Overall, P. plicatus haplotypes reflected a deep history with the majority of
structuring occurring at the population level, while P.
diabolicus exhibited little to no population structuring
and low genetic diversity. This result supports a longer
history for P. plicatus in this region, suggesting the current sympatric distribution is a result of recent movement
of P. diabolicus into the area. The lack of concordant
genetic breaks based on the AMOVA provides additional
support for this hypothesis. In P. diabolicus, there was a
prominent genetic break between northern and southern
groups of populations, while P. plicatus showed most of
the variation to be independent of larger geographic
groupings. Thus, it appears that P. diabolicus populations
have historically been isolated or restricted to the south.
It is not clear whether these historical differences are due
to geography, competitive interactions between the two
species, or other factors not accounted for here. What is
clear is that no single biogeographic barrier has had parallel effects on these two species.
If we use two proposed calibrations for insect mtDNA,
2.3% per million years [12] and 3.54% per million years
[13], we can calculate an approximate range estimating

most recent common ancestor of these two lineages
between 7.7 and 5.0 million years ago. The maximum
pairwise divergence within P. diabolicus was 3.6%, and
within P. plicatus was 4.1%. Thus, the most recent common ancestor of P. diabolicus haplotypes is estimated to
have existed between 1.6 and 1.0 million years ago, relative to between 1.8 and 1.2 million years ago for P. plicatus. These estimates point out that, although the genetic
patterns of these two lineages are quite different, the age
of the most recent common ancestor of each is not.
Based on the mismatch distributions, it is apparent the
time of expansion of P. plicatus preceded that of P. diabolicus. Thus, although our estimate for the most recent
common ancestor of each these lineages is comparable,
comparative analysis of these sister species provides an
opportunity to contrast current diversity patterns with
respect to demographic events that occurred at two different times. These results provide further support for
the hypothesis that P. plicatus has inhabited this area for a
relatively long period of time following a historical population expansion, with little to no current gene flow
among populations. On the other hand, P. diabolicus
appears to have undergone recent population expansion
with high mobility throughout the sampled range.
There have been several other studies comparing the
phylogeographic patterns of sympatric species in an
attempt to isolate the factors affecting extant diversity
patterns. In a study of sister tidewater goby species, Dawson et al. [4] examined the effects of differential dispersal
abilities on phylogeographic structure. Similar to the
results of our study, they found that one species was less
structured with higher gene flow relative to the sister species. In the gobies, this difference was explained by species-specific traits related to habitat preference
(correlated with opportunities for dispersal) and other
natural history traits likely to affect gene flow. Steele et al.
[3] compared the phylogeographic structure of two
closely related sympatric salamanders and also found that
life-history characters related to dispersal ability were
largely responsible for the discordant phylogeographic
structure in these species. In Phloeodes, variation in dispersal ability seems inadequate to explain differential
phylogeographic structuring because 1) both species are
flightless and there is no reason to expect unequal dispersal abilities, and 2) based on our collection records, these
two species have largely overlapping habitat requirements precluding species-specific movement into many
habitat types. Studies of such closely related species highlight how differential demographic histories might affect

inferences from comparative phylogeographic studies on
more distantly related taxa with unknown temporal
dimensions.
It is evident that we're seeing only a small, relatively
recent picture of each species' evolutionary history. This
is evident by the long branches separating the species in
both genes. This is not too surprising since our sampling
is concentrated in the southern portion of both species'
ranges. However, in temperate areas, it is often the case
that southern populations source northern populations
during times of post-glacial expansion, and on that basis
we might have expected to see relatively ancestral populations for both species. But, as has been revealed in other
studies, there have probably been more glacial refugia
scattered around California, and perhaps in cooler and
moister areas than in warmer, drier ones that are found,
at least currently, in southernmost California [14-16].
The differing phylogeographic patterns shown for the
two species may be due, in part, to having maintained
substantial populations in different refugia through climatic fluctuations. It would be extremely valuable to
expand the sampling in the future to cover these species
entire ranges more thoroughly. This would undoubtedly
reveal a more complete history of each, and allow a more
definitive assessment of the factors associated with their
divergence and their surprisingly different phylogeographic patterns.

Conclusions
Based on two independently evolving genetic loci, this
study revealed different evolutionary histories for the
sympatric sister species, Phloeodes diabolicus and P. plicatus, in the beetle family Zopheridae. While the genetic
data revealed unstructured populations in P. diabolicus,
with evidence for a recent population expansion, P. plicatus exhibited geographically structured haplotypes with
evidence of a more ancient population expansion. These
data suggest that historical demographics have had a
larger effect than geography on the extant diversity patterns of these two species.
Methods
Taxon sampling was focused in the Transverse Range
region but also extended into surrounding areas to the
north in the Santa Lucia Mts. and south into the Peninsular Ranges (Figure 1). Specimens were collected under
decaying logs and underneath the bark of dead trees.
Genomic DNA was extracted from forebodies (head and
prothorax) and legs of field collected specimens using
DNeasy Tissue extraction kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
Apart from dissection, extractions were minimally
destructive, and chitinous parts were mounted as vouchers following extraction. Full collection data, including
voucher numbers and corresponding DNA extractions,

can be accessed through the California Beetle Project
database at http://www.sbnature.org/calbeetles. The latter half of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene
was amplified using primers C1-J-1859 and C1-N-3014
[17]. We also amplified a portion of the nuclear rudimentary gene (CAD) using species-specific primers developed from an amplicon generated using the primers
CD439F and CD688R [18]. Subsequent amplification was
optimized by reducing degeneracy of the original primers, and shortening CD688R so that it began 13 base pairs
downstream (CD439FPhlo 5' TTC AGT GTA CAG TTT
CAT CCY GAG CAY AC 3' and CD688RPhlo 5' GGA
TCG ACG TTT TCC ATG TTG CA 3'). PCR products
were purified using QIAquick PCR Purification kits (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) or ExoSAP-IT® (USB corp., Cleveland,
OH). Forward and reverse sequencing reactions and
sequence visualization was done by Macrogen, Inc.
(Seoul, Korea). All DNA sequences were edited in
Geneious Pro 4.5.4 (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, NZ) and
aligned in Se-Al v2.0a11[19]. Gene sequences were
aligned manually and did not contain any indels. Recombination in the nuclear gene was assessed using the PHI
(pairwise homoplasy index) statistic [20] implemented in
the program SplitsTree v4.10 [21,22]. To test for patterns
of selection at either locus, Tajima's D [23] was estimated
in Arlequin v3.1 [24]. Significance was evaluated by comparing the observed test statistic to a distribution generated from 1000 permutations of the original data such
that p values represent the proportion of the distribution
that is less than or equal to the observed value.
Data Analysis

Phylogenetic analysis of each gene was done in MrBayes
v3.1 [25] to infer relationships among haplotypes. Models
of molecular evolution for each marker were evaluated in
MrModelTest v2.3 [26]. According to the Akaike Information Criterion, the COI data best fit the GTR + I + G
model, and the CAD data best fit the GTR + I model.
Gene trees were inferred in MrBayes, imposing the
model specified by the AIC, using default priors. All haplotypes of both species were analyzed together for all
phylogenetic analyses. The mitochondrial tree was
rooted using the sequences of two other beetles in the
family Zopheridae, Zopherus granicollis Horn. and Phellopsis porcata (LeConte) (sequences newly generated).
Maximum uncorrected pairwise distances for each gene
were calculated in PAUP* v4.0 [27]. We also constructed
haplotype networks for each gene using TCS v1.21 [28] to
obtain a non-bifurcating perspective of relationships. We
used the default settings of a 95% connection limit.
In order to identify limits to gene flow and population
structure across the sampling region, we computed pairwise Φst values [29] among groups of populations, and
performed Analyses of Molecular Variance (AMOVA),

Polihronakis and Caterino BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:195

both using Arlequin v.3.1 [24]. Tested groups corresponded to major geographic regions (Figure 1) [16,3032]. The goal of the AMOVA was to identify the deepest
genetic division in each gene. Two-group analyses successively grouped different combinations of northern vs.
southern regions together to test all possible single break
scenarios (with the exception of the southernmost due to
very small sample size for the single small southern population that would constitute one group; see Table 3 for all
AMOVA comparisons).
A mismatch distribution for each of the species was
generated in Arlequin [33] using the COI data only due to
evidence for recombination of the CAD gene in P. plicatus. This distribution provides a graphic representation of
the frequency of pairwise differences within a population,
and can be used to estimate demographic parameters
[34]. Here we compared estimates of the relative time of
expansion (parameter τ), which allowed us to assess the
relative time frame of population expansion for each species.
