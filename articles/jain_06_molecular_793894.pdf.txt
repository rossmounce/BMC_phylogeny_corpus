Abstract
Background: The response regulators represent the elements of bacterial two-component
system and have been characterized from dicot plants like Arabidopsis but little information is
available on the monocots, including the cereal crops. The aim of this study was to characterize
type-A response regulator genes from rice, and to investigate their expression in various organs as
well as in response to different hormones, including cytokinin, and environmental stimuli.
Results: By analysis of the whole genome sequence of rice, we have identified ten genes encoding
type-A response regulators based upon their high sequence identity within the receiver domain.
The exon-intron organization, intron-phasing as well as chromosomal location of all the RT-PCR
amplified rice (Oryza sativa) response regulator (OsRR) genes have been analyzed. The transcripts
of OsRR genes could be detected by real-time PCR in all organs of the light- and dark-grown rice
seedlings/plants, although there were quantitative differences. The steady-state transcript levels of
most of the OsRR genes increased rapidly (within 15 min) on exogenous cytokinin application even
in the presence of cycloheximide. Moreover, the expression of the OsRR6 gene was enhanced in
rice seedlings exposed to salinity, dehydration and low temperature stress.
Conclusion: Ten type-A response regulator genes identified in rice, the model monocot plant,
show overlapping/differential expression patterns in various organs and in response to light. The
induction of OsRR genes by cytokinin even in the absence of de novo protein synthesis qualifies them
to be primary cytokinin response genes. The induction of OsRR6 in response to different
environmental stimuli indicates its role in cross-talk between abiotic stress and cytokinin signaling.
These results provide a foundation for further investigations on specific as well as overlapping
cellular functions of type-A response regulators in rice.

Background
Cytokinins regulate various plant growth and developmental processes, including cell division, apical dominance, chloroplast biogenesis, leaf senescence, vascular

differentiation, photomorphogenic development, shoot
differentiation in tissue cultures and anthocyanin production, primarily by altering the expression of diverse genes
[1,2]. The recent genetic and molecular studies in plants

have suggested the involvement of two-component sensor-regulator system in cytokinin signal perception and
transduction, comprising sensor histidine kinase (HK)
proteins, histidine phosphotransfer (HPt) proteins, and
effector response regulator (RR) proteins [3-9]. Such signal transduction systems, once thought to be restricted to
prokaryotes, have also been found in many eukaryotes,
including yeast, fungi, slime molds and higher plants
[10]. In Arabidopsis, proteins with homology to all the elements of two-component system have been identified [7].
The analysis of Arabidopsis genome revealed the existence
of 32 putative response regulator genes [7]. Based on the
predicted protein domain architecture and amino acid
composition, the response regulators have been broadly
categorized into three distinct families: type-A, type-B and
pseudo-response regulators. The type-A response regulators are relatively small, containing a receiver domain
along with small N- and C-terminal extensions [11]. The
type-B response regulators comprise a receiver domain
fused to the DNA-binding domain and are supposed to be
transcriptional regulators [12-14]. The pseudo-response
regulators share significant sequence similarity with the
receiver domain of other response regulators but the
invariant D-D-K motif is not present [7]. The pseudoresponse regulators are also considered to be the elements
of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis and rice [15-18].
The type-A response regulator genes in Arabidopsis (type-A
ARRs) are rapidly and specifically induced by exogenous
cytokinin, although with varying kinetics, and have been

characterized as primary cytokinin response genes
[11,19,20]. The transcription of type-A ARR genes is regulated in part by type-B ARRs [21,22]. Some of the type-A
ARRs perform partially redundant functions, acting as
negative regulators of cytokinin responses by a feedback
mechanism [21,23,24]. In contrast, ARR4 was claimed to
be a positive regulator of cytokinin signaling because its
over-expression enhanced the cytokinin responsiveness of
transgenic Arabidopsis plants [25]. However, the loss-offunction mutant did not reveal a positive role for ARR4 in
cytokinin signaling [24] and this discrepancy remains to
be resolved. The tissue distribution of ARR4 overlaps to a
large extent with that of phytochrome B (phyB) and it has
been found to interact with N-terminus of phyB to stabilize its active form [26]. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants
overexpressing ARR4 are specifically hypersensitive to red
light [26], indicating that ARR4 may be involved in integrating red light and cytokinin signaling.
The type-A response regulators have been isolated and
characterized from maize [27,28]. However, there is no
report on the characterization of any type-A response regulator from other monocot species, although several EST/
cDNA sequences are available in the databases. Here, we
report the identification and analysis of type-A response
regulator gene family in rice (Oryza sativa), the model
monocot plant. The exon-intron organization, chromosomal distribution and sequence homology have been
analyzed for all ten members. The OsRR genes express differentially in various organs examined, and also in
response to light. The application of exogenous cytokinin

Results and discussion
Identification of type-A response regulators in rice
The information on rice genomic sequence [29,30] provides a powerful tool to identify putative homologous
proteins by database searches with genes of known function from other organisms. In an attempt to identify typeA response regulators in rice, the whole rice genome,
dynamically translated in all reading frames, was analyzed
employing TBLASTN search, using Arabidopsis type-A
response regulator proteins as query. This search identified a total of ten genes showing high sequence similarity
with the Arabidopsis type-A response regulators. These predicted proteins contain a characteristic receiver domain
(harboring conserved D-D-K residues) with short N- and
C-terminal extensions and were designated as Oryza sativa
response regulator (OsRR) proteins. We amplified (by RTPCR) and sequenced nine OsRR cDNAs (OsRR9 and 10
could not be amplified specifically since they possess
>99% identity within the coding region and flanking
sequences). Their sequences were confirmed by comparison with the corresponding genomic sequences. The
cDNA sequences have been deposited in the GenBank,
and their accession numbers, predicted protein length and
genomic locus are given in Table 1.

The BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) or PAC (phage
artificial chromosome) clones carrying the genes for OsRR
proteins were identified (Table 1). The chromosome map
positions of BAC/PACs given in centiMorgans (cM) from
top of the chromosome, and the nearest marker to each
OsRR gene are indicated in Table 1. The ten OsRR genes
were found to be distributed on 7 of the 12 rice chromosomes (Table 1). Three OsRR genes are present on chromosome 4, two on chromosome 2, and one each on

Exon-intron organization and chromosomal distribution
A comparison of the full-length cDNA sequences
(obtained in the present study) with the corresponding
genomic DNA sequences (available in the database)
showed that the coding sequence of majority of the OsRR
genes (6 out of 10) are disrupted by 4 introns (Table 1,
Fig. 1A), suggesting their origin from a common ancestral
gene with a classical pattern of 5 exons and 4 introns.
However, variations in their basic gene structure were
observed for other members, implicating gain (OsRR1
and OsRR2) or loss (OsRR3 and OsRR6) of introns. The

chromosome 1, 7, 8, 11, and 12. The distribution of OsRR
genes on rice chromosomes did not reveal evident clusters. However, OsRR9 and OsRR10 are present on the
duplicated block between chromosome 11 and 12
[32,33].
Sequence analysis
The type-A RRs are mainly composed of a receiver domain
with short N- and C-terminal extensions [34], essentially
similar to the E. coli response regulator (RR) CheY
involved in chemotaxis, and lack a typical output domain.
All the OsRR proteins also contain the highly conserved
Lys and two Asp residues (D-D-K) in the receiver domain
(Fig. 1B, C). Pairwise analysis of the full-length OsRR protein sequences indicates that the overall identities range
from 28% to 71% (100% between OsRR9 and 10, Table
2). However, the amino acid identity within the receiver
domain reaches up to 95%. The receiver domain of typeA RRs in Arabidopsis also showed 60% to 93% identity
among them but less than 30% with that of type-B RRs.
The predicted amino acid sequences of N- and C-terminal
extensions of OsRR proteins are more variable (Fig. 1C),
like Arabidopsis RR proteins [11]. The C-terminal extensions of ARR6 and ARR7 were shown to be responsible for
their nuclear localization [35]. The rice type-A response
regulators, OsRR1, OsRR2, OsRR4, OsRR9 and OsRR10,
also possess C-terminal extensions rich in acidic and
charged residues (Fig. 1B,C). However, OsRR6 and OsRR7
have N-terminal extensions rich in gly and asp residues
(Fig. 1C). These N- and C-terminal variable regions may

play a role in their localization to different cellular compartments.
To examine the phylogenetic relationships of rice, maize,
and Arabidopsis type-A response regulators, an unrooted
tree was constructed from alignments of their full-length
protein sequences (Fig. 2). The OsRR proteins formed
four sister pairs (OsRR1 and 2, OsRR3 and 6, OsRR5 and
7, OsRR9 and 10). This pairing of type-A RRs is consistent
with recent evolutionary duplications postulated to have
occurred in the rice genome [32,36]. The type-A response
regulators in Arabidopsis also formed five sister pairs and
all of them were found to be located on homologous
duplicated chromosomal segments [24]. Thus, it is
remarkable that the duplication of the sister pairs of typeA response regulator genes is associated with chromosomal block duplications in both rice and Arabidopsis.
Recently, the extensive duplication and preferential retention of early auxin-responsive Aux/IAA genes have been
reported in both Arabidopsis and rice [37,38]. The retention of the duplicated type-A response regulator genes in
rice (present study) also supports the idea that the genes
involved in transcription and signal transduction have
been preferentially retained in Arabidopsis [39]. Also, most
of the OsRRs clustered together alongwith maize RRs
(ZmRRs), in clades distinct from Arabidopsis RRs (ARRs)
(Fig. 2). In an earlier study with Arabidopsis RRs, a phylogenetic analysis, including only a few of the monocot RRs,
revealed that the type-A ARRs fall into clades distinct from
rice and maize [24]. The present study corroborates this

observation and strengthens the view that the progenitor
of monocots and dicots probably had only a small family
of RRs and the expansion occurred subsequently, in both
monocots and dicots, by gene duplication.
Organ-specific expression of OsRR genes
To examine the expression pattern of each OsRR gene in
different plant organs, and to assess the effect of light,
quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed with
total RNA isolated from etiolated seedlings, green seedlings, green shoots, roots, mature leaves, and flowers. The
transcripts of all the OsRR genes were detected in various
organs examined but they displayed a complex expression
pattern (Fig. 3). Most of the OsRR genes were expressed at
relatively higher level in mature tissues (leaves and flowers). The expression of OsRR genes was also higher in
roots (present study), which is essentially similar to most
of the ARRs [11]. The transcript levels of OsRR2, 3, 4, 6, 7,
and 9 were significantly higher in etiolated seedlings as
compared to green seedlings (Fig. 3). However, OsRR5
exhibited higher expression in green seedlings. Interestingly, in a recent study, the arr mutants in Arabidopsis
exhibited altered red light sensitivity [24]. Also, ARR4 has
been found to interact with phytochrome B and stabilize
its active form [26]. These results suggest that OsRR genes
exhibit overlapping and differential expression patterns,
playing predominant roles in specific organs and may also
be involved in light signal transduction.

OsRRs represent primary cytokinin response genes
Cytokinin regulates the expression of a large number of
genes including type-A response regulators in Arabidopsis
and maize [11,27,40]. To study the effect of cytokinin on
the transcript levels of individual OsRR genes, the lightgrown rice seedlings were treated with exogenous cytokinin for various durations over a 6 h period, and real-time
PCR analysis was performed. Consistent with the results
reported earlier with Arabidopsis [11], the steady-state transcript levels of OsRR genes were elevated within 15 min of
exogenous cytokinin application (Fig. 4). The kinetics of
induction with cytokinin was similar for most OsRR
genes, with the transcript levels reaching its maximum in
1 h, and declining thereafter. There was, however, no significant change in the transcript abundance of OsRR3 and
8 following cytokinin treatment (Fig. 4). The rapid induction of type-A ARRs by exogenous cytokinin has been
shown to mediate a feedback mechanism, which
decreases the sensitivity of the plant to the hormone, indicating that type-A RRs act as negative regulators of cytokinin-induced responses [21,23,24]. The type-B RRs are the
transcription factors that are involved in the transcriptional activation of the type-A response regulators in
response to cytokinins [13,21,22].

Many primary response genes, such as auxin-induced Aux/
IAA genes, are induced in the absence of de novo protein
synthesis [41]. The genes encoding type-A RRs in Arabidop-

sis have also been described as the primary cytokinin
response genes [11,42]. To determine whether the OsRR
genes also belong to the same category, their induction by
cytokinin was examined in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide (Fig. 5). The steady-state
transcript levels of most of the OsRR genes increased (up
to 2- to 2.5-fold) on treatment with cycloheximide, suggesting that the transcription of these genes is regulated by
a short-lived repressor protein. The increase in transcript
abundance (up to 4- to 6-fold) of rice Aux/IAA genes
examined (OsIAA9, OsIAA13 and OsIAA20) [38] in the
same RNA samples (data not shown), confirmed that
cycloheximide treatment was biologically effective in our
experiments. Further, cycloheximide failed to block the
induction of these genes by cytokinin; the transcript levels
of OsRR genes were higher in the samples treated with
BAP in the presence of cycloheximide as compared to BAP
alone (Fig. 5). These results suggest that OsRR genes constitute a class of primary cytokinin response genes.
The expression of OsRR genes in response to other plant
hormones, including auxin, brassinosteroid, gibberellin
and ethylene, was also examined. However, no significant
effect of these hormones could be detected on the steadystate transcript levels of OsRR genes (Fig. 5), indicating
their role primarily in cytokinin signaling.

Expression of OsRR genes under stress conditions
It has been claimed earlier that the expression of some of
the type-A response regulators in Arabidopsis is induced by
different environmental stresses such as drought, salinity
and low temperature [43]. To investigate, whether some
of the OsRR genes are also involved in stress responses,
their expression levels were examined by real-time PCR
analysis of the RNA isolated from young rice seedlings
subjected to various abiotic stress treatments. The expression of a majority of OsRR genes was not significantly
altered under stress (data not shown), with the notable
exception of OsRR6. The expression of OsRR6 gene was
induced to significant levels by salt, dehydration and low
temperature treatments (Fig. 6), and results were reproducible. This indicates that OsRR6 may play an important
role in abiotic stress signaling in rice, besides acting as a
component in cytokinin signaling. It is noteworthy here
that a transmembrane hybrid-type histidine kinase,
AHK1, closely related to cytokinin receptors, is a putative
osmosensor in Arabidopsis [44].
What are the probable functions of OsRR proteins?
The type-A RRs in Arabidopsis have been shown to act as
the negative regulators of cytokinin signaling with partially redundant functions [11,24]. In addition, some of
these ARRs and other elements of the two-component

greatly help in elucidation of the precise role of these
genes.

sensor-regulator phosphorelay participate in cross-talk
between cytokinin and light signaling (mediated by phytochromes) and also with the gaseous hormone ethylene
[4,45]. The role of one of the type-A RRs, i.e. ARR4, has
also been ascribed in red light mediated photomorphogenesis [24,26]. In fact, ARR4 physically associates with
phytochrome B to prolong the stability of its active conformation, Pfr, and accentuates red light signaling. The
role of type-B ARRs (and possibly of type-A ARRs) has also
been envisaged in a cross-talk between ethylene and cytokinin signaling, although they may regulate these components differentially to control diverse plant processes [4].
To have an inkling about the functions of OsRR genes, the
rice Tos17 insertion mutant database [46] providing the
phenotype of rice Tos17 retrotransposon insertion
mutants [47] was accessed using the BLAST program. We
could identify insertion mutants corresponding only to
OsRR9/10
gene
(NE6006_0_401_1A
and
ND8005_0_402_1A); it was difficult to demarcate
whether the sequence flanking the Tos17 insertion represents OsRR9 or OsRR10 because of more than 99% similarity between them. Despite the fact that OsRR9 and
OsRR10 genes are so similar and may function redundantly, the phenotype of the insertion mutants (representing only one of these two loci) showed dwarfism, sterility,
lesion mimic and vivipary. It can thus be speculated that
OsRR9/10 genes may quantitatively affect different cellular processes influenced by both light and cytokinin. A
detailed analysis of the insertional mutants already avail-

The results of structural analyses of rice type-A RR proteins
and their phylogenetic relationship with ARRs will be
helpful for their functional validation in rice. The organspecific differential expression profile of OsRR genes suggests that their products most likely perform diverse and
overlapping functions in different cell types of rice. This
study also reflects the role of OsRR genes in both light and
cytokinin signaling. The induction of OsRR6 by different
abiotic stress stimuli provides a molecular link between
stress and cytokinin signaling as well. These results provide a foundation for future work on the elucidation of
cellular functions of type-A response regulators in rice.

Methods
Sequence analysis
The type-A response regulator genes in rice were identified
by performing BLAST searches at the National Centre for
Biotechnology Information [48] and TIGR genomic and
annotated database [49] resources of rice using the
response regulator protein sequences of Arabidopsis thaliana as query. The number and positions of exons and
introns for individual OsRR genes were determined by
comparison of the cDNAs with their corresponding
genomic DNA sequences. The position of each gene on
rice chromosomes was found by BLASTN search in
genomic sequences of rice chromosome pseudomolecules
available at TIGR (Release 3). Multiple sequence alignments were done using the ClustalX (version 1.83) program [50] and the phylogenetic analysis carried out by
neighbor-joining method [51]. The unrooted phylogenetic tree was displayed using the Treeview program. The
DNA and protein sequence analyses were performed
using Gene Runner program version 3.04. Pairwise comparisons were done with the DNASTAR MegAlign 4.03
package to determine the sequence identities.
Plant material and growth conditions
Rice (Oryza sativa L. ssp. indica var. Pusa Basmati 1) seeds
were disinfected with 0.1% HgCl2 solution for 1 h and
thoroughly washed with RO (reverse-osmosis) water
before soaking overnight in RO water. Seedlings were
grown on cotton saturated with RO water, at 28 ± 1°C,
either in complete darkness or in a culture room with a
daily photoperiodic cycle of 14 h light and 10 h dark.
Flowers and mature leaves were collected from rice plants
grown in the greenhouse.
Hormone and stress treatments
For cytokinin treatment, 6-day-old light-grown rice seedlings were transferred to a solution of 50 µM benzyl ami-

nopurine (BAP) and harvested at the indicated times. For
treatment with other hormones/compounds, 6-day-old
light-grown rice seedlings were transferred to beakers containing solutions of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, 50 µM),
epibrassinolide (Ebr, 10 µM), gibberellic acid (GA3, 50
µM), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC, 50
µM), abscisic acid (ABA, 50 µM) and cycloheximide
(CHX, 50 µM) and incubated for for 3 h. The mocktreated seedlings for the respective time intervals served as
the control.
For salt and drought stress treatments, 6-day-old lightgrown rice seedlings were transferred to 250 mM NaCl or
300 mM mannitol for 6 h. For low temperature treatment,
the seedlings were kept at 8 ± 1°C for 6 h. The seedlings
kept in water for the same duration, and at 28 ± 1°C,
served as control.
RNA isolation
Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Plant mini kit
(Qiagen, Germany). To remove any genomic DNA contamination, the RNA samples were treated with RNasefree DNase I (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. For each RNA sample, absorption at 260 nm
was measured and RNA concentration calculated as A260 ×
40 (µg/mL) × dilution factor. The integrity of RNA samples was monitored by agarose gel elecrophoresis.
cDNA isolation, cloning and sequencing
The coding region of OsRR genes were amplified by RTPCR, using gene-specific primers, from total RNA isolated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/1

from light-grown seedlings using Titan One Tube RT-PCR
kit (Roche, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 30 or 35 cycles, the PCR products were examined by gel electrophoresis and EtBr staining. RT-PCR
products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega,
Madison, WI) as per manufacturer's instructions.
Sequencing was carried out using ABI Prism 377
Sequencer (PE Applied Biosystems, USA), with the Thermosequenase Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Amersham, UK).
Quantitative real-time PCR expression analysis
The transcript levels of type-A OsRR genes in various RNA
samples were quantified by real-time PCR analysis
employing ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System
and software (PE Applied Biosystems, USA) as described
previously [52]. Primers were designed by using the
primer design software Primer Express 2.0 (PE Applied
Biosystems, USA). To ensure that the primers amplify a
unique and desired cDNA segment, each pair of primers
was checked in the BLAST program in rice genomic
sequence available in TIGR database. The primer
sequences are listed in Table 3. Primers specific to OsRR9
and 10 could not be designed as more than 99% identity
was found in the coding region and flanking sequences.
First strand cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcribing
3 µg of total RNA using High Capacity cDNA Archive kit
(Applied Biosystems, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Diluted cDNA samples were used as
template and mixed with 200 nM of each primer and
SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, USA)
for real-time PCR analysis. PCR reactions were performed
using the following parameters: 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at
95°C, and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C in
96-well optical reaction plates (Applied Biosystems,
USA). The identities of the amplicons and the specificity
of the reaction were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis
and melting curve analysis, respectively. The relative
mRNA levels for each of the OsRR genes in different RNA
samples were computed with respect to the internal standard, UBQ5, to normalize for variance in the quality of
RNA and the amount of input cDNA. At least two different
RNA isolations and cDNA syntheses were used for quantification and each cDNA sample subjected to real-time
PCR in triplicate. The values presented are the mean of the
two biological replicates, each with three technical replicates. The error bars indicate the standard deviation from
the mean.
