Abstract
Background: When aligning several hundreds or thousands of sequences, such as epidemic virus
sequences or homologous/orthologous sequences of some big gene families, to reconstruct the
epidemiological history or their phylogenies, how to analyze and visualize the alignment results of
many sequences has become a new challenge for computational biologists. Although there are
several tools available for visualization of very long sequence alignments, few of them are applicable
to the alignments of many sequences.
Results: A multiple-logo alignment visualization tool, called Phylo-mLogo, is presented in this paper.
Phylo-mLogo calculates the variabilities and homogeneities of alignment sequences by base
frequencies or entropies. Different from the traditional representations of sequence logos, PhylomLogo not only displays the global logo patterns of the whole alignment of multiple sequences, but
also demonstrates their local homologous logos for each clade hierarchically. In addition, PhylomLogo also allows the user to focus only on the analysis of some important, structurally or
functionally constrained sites in the alignment selected by the user or by built-in automatic
calculation.
Conclusion: With Phylo-mLogo, the user can symbolically and hierarchically visualize hundreds of
aligned sequences simultaneously and easily check the changes of their amino acid sites when
analyzing many homologous/orthologous or influenza virus sequences. More information of PhylomLogo can be found at URL http://biocomp.iis.sinica.edu.tw/phylomlogo.

Background
Sequence alignment and inference of the phylogenies is a
standard procedure for analyzing biological sequences.
Based on the reconstructed phylogenetic relationship, the
evolutionary histories of sampled species, individuals, or
strains can be inferred. Traditionally researchers are used
to assigning numbers to all clades in the phylogenetic
analysis of individual gene segments and using them to

represent and compare genotypes across homologous
genes or multiple species [1]. However, when the number
of analyzed sequences is in the hundreds or thousands,
this approach cannot distinguish the differences among
sequences from different homologous genes [1,2] or from
different strains, such as viral sequences from different
strains [3]. Moreover, the evolutionary changes of some
specific sites, such as positively selected or antigenic sites,

cannot be directly observed by global phylogenetic analysis, short of checking the detailed alignment results.
Therefore, how to design efficient tools for biologists to
analyze and visualize alignments of many sequences has
become a challenge for computational biologists.
In recent years there are several visualization tools of
sequence alignments available in the public domain.
Based on the visualization outputs, these tools can be
divided into two categories: curve-based and sequencelogo-based. In the former category, tools, such as VISTA
family [4], PipMaker [5,6], zPicture [7], and SinicView [8],
were developed to visualize individual alignment results
or to compare and evaluate assorted alignment results
obtained by different tools. These tools are useful for visualizing very long sequence alignment results of a few
sequences. However, for cases of many but short sequence
alignments, they are impractical because some significant
variations between sequences may be submerged by global scoring profiles which are calculated by either identical rates or sum-of-pair scores.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/63

functional regions can help researchers examine functional and evolutionary characteristics of alignment
regions [15,16]. To improve the capabilities of the abovementioned tools and help researchers better understand
influenza virus evolution or more easily identify genetic
signatures we develop a multiple-logo alignment visualization tool, called Phylo-mLogo, which allows the user to
simultaneously visualize the global profile of the whole
multiple sequence alignment and homologous logos of
each clade in a hierarchical manner. Phylo-mLogo calculates the variabilities and homogeneities of aligned
sequences by base frequencies or entropies. Different
from the traditional representations of sequence logos,
Phylo-mLogo not only displays the global logo patterns of
the whole alignment but also demonstrates their local
logos for each clade. In addition, Phylo-mLogo also allows
the user to focus only on the analysis of some important,
structurally or functionally constrained sites in the alignment selected by the user or by built-in automatic calculation.

Implementation
In the latter category, tools such as WebLogo [9] and
LogoBar [10], were developed, using sequence logos to
graphically represent informative patterns of each individual site in a multiple sequence alignment. The sequence
logos can assist the user to discover and identify conserved
patterns from multiple sequence alignments [11]. The
original work was first proposed by Schneider and
Stephens (1990). Crooks et al. (2004) developed WebLogo [9] and performed an extension that incorporates
additional features and options. To distinguish the gaps
and poorly conserved positions, LogoBar [10] was proposed to display protein sequence logos including both
amino acids and gaps. These sequence-logo-based tools
are very useful to globally visualize consensus patterns in
a multiple sequence alignment. However, when the
number of aligned sequences is in several hundreds or
thousands, some significant local tendencies of mutations
cannot be observed directly from these global sequencelogo-based profiles.
All of these tools can only generate a global sequence logo
for one multiple sequence alignment and have no interactive user interface to allow the user to compare sequence
logos in different clades simultaneously, to manipulate
the comparison by various observation ranges and individual sites, or to generate a set of images or PDFs of multiple logos comparison. In the analysis of influenza virus
evolution, for example, tracking the transitional changes
of the amino acids at the epitope or receptor binding sites
is very important, because their changes could cause antigenic drift [12], affect viral transcription [13], and determine receptor specificity [14]. Furthermore, identifying
genetic signatures of natural selection in coding or other

There are a viewing section and a panel control section in
Phylo-mLogo. The viewing section includes Root Logo
View, Clade Logos View, and Detailed Text Alignment
View, while the control section provides the user with a
suite of versatile control functions for visualizing the
alignment results from different perspectives. In what follows, we will introduce the characteristics and functionality of Phylo-mLogo in more detail.
Scoring methods in Phylo-mLogo
The scoring methods adopted in Phylo-mLogo to calculate
the variabilities and homogeneities of aligned sequences
are based on entropy or base frequencies. Sequence logos
graphically represent informative patterns in a multiple
sequence alignment [9,11]. Schneider and Stephens
(1990) defined the sequence conservation Rseq at a fixed
position in the alignment as the difference between the
maximum possible entropy Smax and the entropy Sobs of
the observed symbol distribution [11]:

Rseq = Smax − Sobs = log 2 N − (−∑ i =1 pi log 2 pi ),
N

where pi is the observed frequency of symbol i at a fixed
position and N is the number of distinct symbols for the
given sequences types [11]. The maximum sequence conservation per site is log24 = 2 bits for nucleotide sequences
and log220 ≈ 4.32 bits for amino acid sequences [9]. A
sequence logo shows each base by the total number of bits
of information multiplied by the relative occurrence of
the nucleotide or amino acid at the position. Sequence
logos enable fast and intuitive visual assessment of pattern characteristics applied to many fields [17]. However,
in some not highly conserved cases, the entropies of the

In the Viewing Section, the sequence logo shown in Root Logo View represents the frequencies of the amino acids over the whole aligned sequences while those shown in Clade Logos Views demonstrate the logos for the sequences belonging to the same clade.

sequences are usually lower or just close to half of maximum sequence conservation so that the generated
sequence logos may be compressed together and not conspicuous. Thus, the magnitudes of the sequence logos in
some literature reflect only the relative occurrence frequencies of the bases at the position, without being multiplied by their entropies [18,19]. For convenience of
making a distinction, the latter type of sequence logos is
called the frequency sequence logos, and the former type the
entropy sequence logos. The user can select different type of
sequence logos shown in the Root Logo View and Clade
Logos View sections.
Viewing section in Phylo-mLogo
As shown in Fig. 1, the sequence logo in the Root Logo
View represents the base information of the whole alignment and the heights of each logo are the occurrence frequencies. If the user selects the entropy option, all heights
of the logos will be multiplied by their entropies. Below

the logos in this View, the positions in the whole alignment are also marked so as to assist the user in comparison with others in the literature.
In the Clade Logos View, the panels show different
sequence logos of the aligned sequences belonging to
selected clades. By observing the graphical results, it is
much more intuitive and straightforward to judge and
identify the selective or evolutionary trends of alignment
results between different phylogeny, regionalization, or
seasonality. When the user clicks the colored bar above
the logo graphics, the Detailed Text Alignment View will
automatically show the detailed alignment result in a
colored text format where identical characters are shown.
Panel control section in Phylo-mLogo
In the control section, there are three panels for selecting
the sequence logos from root to clades and the sites from
totality to partiality: Phylogeny/Relationship Viewing

Control, Site Selection Control, and Viewing Range Control. Phylogeny/Relationship Viewing Control shows the
relationship structure of aligned input sequences. The
structure could be the phylogenetic tree for cross-species
or different lineage sequences, the regionalization for polymorphic sequences, or the seasonalities for epidemic
influenza virus sequences. Because showing a scaled tree
usually takes up a lot of space on a screen, Phylogeny/
Relationship Viewing Control in Phylo-mLogo demonstrates these relationships by a hierarchical file system
browser, an unscaled tree, in which each node (a clade)
represents a group of well-aligned sequences and the
related child nodes will be expanded once the user clicks
the parent node. As a file or directory name shown in the
file browser, there is a name following each node given by
the user or by built-in automatic assignment. When the
user clicks the name part of either a parent or child node,
the sequence logo associated with this node will be calculated and the result shown in the Clade Logos View. When
the user clicks again the name part, which is a toggle
switch, its sequence logo will become invisible.
Moreover, Phylo-mLogo also provides a Sequence Pool
Panel in Phylogeny/Relationship Viewing Control, which

shows the names of all input sequences extracted from the
header lines of each sequence in input alignment files.
When users want to observe the sequence logo of a single
sequence, they can directly click the sequence name and
pull it from the Sequence Pool to the expected location in
Clade Logos View. The sequence logo will be automatically generated and shown in the location (Fig 2A). If
users want to see the sequence logo of a set of designated
sequences, they just need to press the Ctrl key, simultaneously click these designated sequences, and then pull
them to the Clade Logos View. The logos for these selected
sequences will be generated immediately (Fig 2B).
In some cases, the user may be interested in only some
specific regions. Phylo-mLogo provides a function, called
Viewing Range Control, to let users select the region of
interest and demonstrate only the local sequence logo in
the logo viewing panels. Moreover, Phylo-mLogo also
allows users to select some important, structurally and
functionally constrained or informative sites in the
aligned sequences and then visualize only the sequence
logos of these specific sites. In Site Selection Control,
these sites can be selected by the user manually or by
built-in automatic calculation which is based on selection

of either high frequency bases in low conservation cases or
low frequency ones in high conservation cases. Thus,
when the length of alignment result is long or the
sequences are highly similar or only partially conserved,
the user can observe only those informative sites rather
than examine the whole alignment.
Other characteristics of Phylo-mLogo
Phylo-mLogo is implemented entirely in Java language to
ensure portability across major platforms. The execution
procedure of the standalone Phylo-mLogo is quite straightforward. When launched, the user can load his/her phylogenetic or relationship tree files and the alignment results
from the local disk. In Options, there are several options
which allow the user to select the display panel, logo type
(frequency or entropy), and initial positional index (base
index). Furthermore, all graphics of the sequence logos
can be exported to portable color image files. For more
details of the installation and operations please visit our
Website [20].

Results
In what follows, we will introduce two examples in the
study of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) genes and mammalian olfactory receptor (OR) genes to demonstrate how
Phylo-mLogo can assist users to observe and analyze alignment results of many sequences. The total numbers of
alignment sequences in these two examples are 453 and
1425, respectively. The phylogenetic relationships of the
aligned sequences are acquired in each example.
Example 1: 453 avian influenza HA genes
The spread of H5N1 avian influenza from China to
Europe has raised a global concern about their potential
to infect humans and cause a pandemic. A more comprehensive collection of data and analysis of avian influenza
sequences are critically needed for biologists and epidemiologists to find out the virulence and transmissibility of
these viruses from avian species to humans. Obenauer et
al. (2006) established the first large-scale sequencing
effort to collect additional genomic data on the avian population of influenza A viruses [3]. They introduced a proteotyping method to identify and number unique amino
acid signatures, called proteotypes, for sequences that may
or may not be distinguished by branches on a phylogenetic tree. They analyzed eight avian influenza genes and
provided the proteograms to demonstrate the amino acid
signatures within each clade (Figures S2-S9 in the supplementary material of [3]). Based on the observations, they
concluded that the virus families tend to have multiple
core conserved genes and that the surface glycoproteins,
HA and NA, appear to be more freely exchanged than core
proteins because of immune pressure [3].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/63

In this part, we downloaded 437 avian influenza HA
genes used for analysis in [3]. Because it was very time
consuming to infer the phylogenetic tree of these
sequences by MrBayes [3,21], we observed the tree shown
in Fig. S6 in [3] directly and constructed their phylogenetic relationship manually. The proteotypes of the analyzed sequences included p1.1, p2.1, p5.1–4, p6.1–6,
p8.1, p9.1, p9.2, and p12.1. Based on these proteotypes,
we first aligned the sequences of each proteotype and then
aligned these proteotypes together, by ClustalW [22]. The
total alignment length is 584.
Figure 3A shows the sequence logos and their phylogenetic tree simultaneously. Different from other tools for
tree visualization [23], Plylo-mLogo displays the phylogenetic tree by using a standard file browser because this representation is more compact than that of the traditional
tree visualization of the original phylogenetic tree as
shown in Fig. 3B. Thus, the user can click on different
clades shown in various background colors, like selecting
different folders in a file browser, to visualize the
sequence logos of the alignment at different levels.
Stevens et al. (2006) listed some conserved residues with
the receptor binding domains of H1 and H5 serotypes
that are implicated in receptor specificity, amino acid
positions 183, 190, 193, 194, 216, 221, 222, and 225–8
[24] to which the corresponding positions in our example
are 205, 212, 215, 216, 238, 243, 244, and 247–250,
respectively. Then, we compared these sequence logos
among different proteotypes. To avoid confusion in this
example, we used the original positions shown in Stevens
et al. (2006). As shown in Fig. 3C, the amino acids at residue sites 194, 225, and 228 are almost conserved across
H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, and H12 serotypes. If we only
consider H1, H2, and H6, the same clades as H5 [3,25],
the amino acids at sites 183, 190, 194, 225, 226, and 228
are almost the same across these serotypes.
Briefly, Phylo-mLogo can assist users in comparing and visualizing the changes of polymorphisms and indel events
across different clades or subtypes of the alignment of
many sequences so that users could speculate possible
evolutionary and functional mechanisms and examine
their hypotheses further.
Example 2: 1425 human and mouse functional olfactory
receptor genes
Olfactory receptor (OR) genes that encode the proteins
used for detecting odor molecules are the largest multigene family in mammals [2,26]. OR genes do not have
any intron in the coding regions and the encoded proteins
are 300 to 350 amino acids in length. Being a member of
the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, OR
genes include seven transmembrane domains (TM1-TM7,

19–26 amino acid each) interconnected by intracellular
and extracellular loops, an extracellular C-terminal chain,
and an intracellular N-terminal chain [27,28].
The functional OR genes are separated into class I and
class II [29]. In the human genome, Niimura and Nei
(2003) have identified 388 OR genes among which 57
and 331 genes belong to class I and class II, respectively
[1,29]. Moreover, they also identified 19 phylogenetic
clades (clades A-S) for human class II OR genes and found
that many genes belonging to a phylogenetic clade were
located in the same genomic cluster [1]. In 2005, they
conducted a detailed study of functional OR genes and
pseudogenes in mice and identified 1,037 functional
genes and 354 pseudogenes. The number of functional
genes is 2.7 times greater than that of humans, whereas
the number of pseudogenes is slightly smaller in mice
than in humans [30].
In this example, we downloaded the whole human and
mouse functional OR genes from [1], 1,425 sequences in
total, and their detailed annotations. We aligned these
sequences by FFT-NS-I [31] and then constructed their
neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree by MEGA3 [32].
According to Niimura and Nei's classification [1,30], we
also indicated 19 phylogenetic clades (clades A-S) of class
II OR genes in the final alignment and in the phylogenetic
tree.
The phylogenetic relationship of all human and mouse
functional OR genes is shown in the left part of Fig. 4A.
We selected several major branches which include over
ten sequences each, and displayed their corresponding
logos shown in the right part of Fig. 4A. We observed that
the residues at some sites are highly conserved across different branches but others are not. Some blank regions in
the logos show that the columns in these regions across
the whole alignment are almost filled with gaps due to
some insertions in only a few sequences.
For users to quickly identify and annotate functional
regions or specific target sites, we have implemented in
Phylo-mLogo an operation that allows the user to select
some annotated or well-studied sequences in the alignment and to pull them from the sequence pool in the Phylogeny/Relationship Viewing Control to Clade Logos
View and create new logos for reference. In this example,
we selected HsOR17.1.14, also known as OR1E1, as a reference sequence to determine the locations of TM
domains in the alignment. We used this sequence because
the positions of its TM domains had been identified [33].
Then, we pulled the sequence from the sequence pool to
the top of Clade Logos View and a new logo of the selected
sequence was generated (Fig 4B). Moreover, we also
selected 19 phylogenetic clades (clades A-S) of class II OR

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/63

genes according to Niimura and Nei's classification
[1,30]. The boundaries of seven TM domains in the alignment can therefore be identified. For example, the start
and the end positions of TM1 are 120 and 146 respectively
and those of TM2 domains are 164 and 187, respectively
(Fig. 4C).
Interestingly, we have found many sites which seem to
have undergone positive selection because their amino
acids are fixed within some clades but different from those
in the other clades. For example, the majority of amino
acids at site 120 in TM1 domain in the clades A, D, E, G,
H, L, M, N, O, Q, R, and S are Q's (Glutamine, noncharged). But those in clades C,F, and J are E's (Glutamic
acid, negatively charged) while those in clade I and in
class I are both positively charged (K (Lysine) in clade I
and H (Histidine) in class I). Moreover, the amino acids
at site 171 (TM2 domain) in most clades are S's (Serine,
polar) but they are A's (Alanine, non-polar) in three
clades of class II, implying that at these sites in different
clades their physico-chemical properties should be different.
To sum up, the residues at a single site which are conserved only within some clades usually could not be identified by a global logo representation. However, these sites
are generally considered to have undergone positive selection and possess some kinds of biological meanings.
Although the problem of how to identify positively
selected sites should be tackled by concrete computational models rather than by visualization, using PhylomLogo, as the examples show, may allow the user to visually inspect the potential sites in the initial step of
sequence analysis as well as to demonstrate computational results in the final stage of representation.

Discussion
Different visualization targets for large-scale and many
sequence alignment results
To date, deluged by the rate and complexity of completed
genomic sequences, the need to align not only longer
sequences but also many sequences becomes more
urgent. When comparing large-scale sequences, one of the
objectives is to identify common conserved regions across
species. Usually, the number of sequences is small but the
total number of bases could be up to tens of millions [34].
In contrast, when aligning many sequences we focus on
finding the heterogeneities of sequences that belong to
the same species or population. Thus, the visualization
target for large-scale sequence alignments is usually to
demonstrate homologous regions and identify their conservations while that for many sequence alignments is to
focus on the heterogeneities of the whole alignment and
to exhibit common properties of these heterogeneous
parts. Phylo-mLogo is suitable for users to observe the het-

erogeneities of an alignment of many sequences as well as
to look at the homogeneities of these heterogeneous sites.

Operating system(s): Window XP, Sun OS 5.7 Sparc, Mac
OS 10.4.2 Tiger, and Linux Fedora Core 3

Limitations and further possible enhancements for PhylomLogo
Generally speaking, Phylo-mLogo provides an effective and
efficient representation for hierarchical visualization of
alignments of many sequences. The proposed representation can help users observe directly the heterogeneities
and mutation trends from hundreds or thousands of
sequences. However, the sequence-logo-based approach
is site independent and does not indicate the relationship
between strains. Therefore, combining Phylo-mLogo with
graphically detailed maps like proteotype [3] and colorful
amino acid map in [35] could assist the user to understand the correlative relationship between different
strains.

Authors' contributions
The maximum number of sequences and total length of
alignment allowed in Phylo-mLogo are dependent on the
capacity of internal memory and Java setting of the computer used. In practice, to run Phylo-mLogo on a 3GHz
Pentium4 PC with 1GB RAM, the largest data set we have
tested contains 3,081 H3N2 HA sequences and the length
of the alignment is 1,783 bases. In this case, the performance was fine in both loading and manipulation. However, if the user's computer is not as good as what we used,
we suggest that the maximum length of alignment had
better be less than 1,000 bases in order to obtain a good
performance on both sequence logo calculation and displaying speed while the maximum number of sequences
could still be in the hundreds.

Conclusion
Deluged by the increasing number of virus sequences,
how to visualize alignment results of many sequences has
become a new challenge for computational biologists. In
this paper, we have presented a multiple-logo alignment
visualization tool. Using Phylo-mLogo, the user can visualize the global profile of the whole multiple sequence
alignment and to hierarchically examine homologous
logos of each clade simultaneously. With Phylo-mLogo, the
user can symbolically and hierarchically visualize hundreds of aligned sequences simultaneously and easily
check the potential sites under different selection pressures, as demonstrated in the analysis of many homologous/orthologous or influenza virus sequences.
