Abstract
Background: Ferns have generally been neglected in studies of chloroplast genomics. Before this
study, only one polypod and two basal ferns had their complete chloroplast (cp) genome reported.
Tree ferns represent an ancient fern lineage that first occurred in the Late Triassic. In recent
phylogenetic analyses, tree ferns were shown to be the sister group of polypods, the most diverse
group of living ferns. Availability of cp genome sequence from a tree fern will facilitate
interpretation of the evolutionary changes of fern cp genomes. Here we have sequenced the
complete cp genome of a scaly tree fern Alsophila spinulosa (Cyatheaceae).
Results: The Alsophila cp genome is 156,661 base pairs (bp) in size, and has a typical quadripartite
structure with the large (LSC, 86,308 bp) and small single copy (SSC, 21,623 bp) regions separated
by two copies of an inverted repeat (IRs, 24,365 bp each). This genome contains 117 different genes
encoding 85 proteins, 4 rRNAs and 28 tRNAs. Pseudogenes of ycf66 and trnT-UGU are also
detected in this genome. A unique trnR-UCG gene (derived from trnR-CCG) is found between rbcL
and accD. The Alsophila cp genome shares some unusual characteristics with the previously
sequenced cp genome of the polypod fern Adiantum capillus-veneris, including the absence of 5 tRNA
genes that exist in most other cp genomes. The genome shows a high degree of synteny with that
of Adiantum, but differs considerably from two basal ferns (Angiopteris evecta and Psilotum nudum).
At one endpoint of an ancient inversion we detected a highly repeated 565-bp-region that is absent
from the Adiantum cp genome. An additional minor inversion of the trnD-GUC, which is possibly
shared by all ferns, was identified by comparison between the fern and other land plant cp genomes.
Conclusion: By comparing four fern cp genome sequences it was confirmed that two major
rearrangements distinguish higher leptosporangiate ferns from basal fern lineages. The Alsophila cp
genome is very similar to that of the polypod fern Adiantum in terms of gene content, gene order
and GC content. However, there exist some striking differences between them: the trnR-UCG gene
represents a putative molecular apomorphy of tree ferns; and the repeats observed at one
inversion endpoint may be a vestige of some unknown rearrangement(s). This work provided fresh
insights into the fern cp genome evolution as well as useful data for future phylogenetic studies.

Ferns (monilophytes), with more than 10,000 living species, are the most diverse group of seed-free vascular
plants [6,7]. Previous studies have uncovered considerable genomic rearrangements in fern cp genomes, but the
details and exact series of these events have not yet been
fully characterized [3,4,8]. The completed cp genome
sequence of the polypod fern Adiantum capillus-veneris
shows some unusual features not seen in vascular plants
before, including tRNA gene losses, which had only been
observed in cp genomes of non-photosynthetic plants
[9,10]. For example, a putative tRNA-selenocysteine (tRNASec) gene in Adiantum [10] replaces the typical trnR-CCG
gene. Unfortunately, because Adiantum is the only
sequenced representative of leptosporangiates, the most
diverse fern lineage, it is difficult to tell which characteristics are unique to Adiantum or diagnostic of a much larger
clade. Therefore, complete cp genome data from more
fern clades are necessary to better resolve these issues.

Background
The chloroplast (cp) genome has long been a focus of
research in plant molecular evolution and systematics due
to its small size, high copy number, conservation and
extensive characterization at the molecular level [1]. More
recently, with technical advances in DNA sequencing, the
number of completely sequenced cp genomes has grown
rapidly. Aside from providing information on genome
structure, gene content, gene order and nucleotide composition, complete cp genome sequences also offer a
unique opportunity to explore the evolutionary changes
of the genome itself. In general, cp genomes are structurally highly conserved across land plants. However, structural rearrangements, e.g. gene loss, inverted repeat (IR)
loss or expansion and inversion, do occur in certain lineages and have been shown to be extremely informative in
resolving deep phylogenetic relationships because they
may exhibit less homoplasy than sequence data [1]. For
example, a 30-kb inversion shared by all vascular plants
except lycopsids identifies the lycopsids as the basal lineage in the vascular plants [2]. Two inversions and an IR
expansion can be used to clarify basal nodes in the leptosporangiate ferns [3,4].

As part of an effort to shed more light on the cp genome
evolution in ferns, we have sequenced the complete plastid genome of a scaly tree fern Alsophila spinulosa (ab.
Alsophila) (Cyatheaceae). This taxon was chosen because it
is an easily available representative of an ancient lineage –
tree ferns, for which no cp genome has been sequenced
before. In addition to tree ferns, heterosporous and polypod ferns are the other two main lineages within the "core
leptosporangiates" [11]. The three major lineages of "core
leptosporangiates" were thought to have originated from
a Late Triassic diversification [11]. Recent phylogenetic
studies further demonstrated a sister relationship between
tree ferns and polypods [6,11,12]. After the Late Triassic
diversification, polypods remarkably re-diversified along
with angiosperms in the Cretaceous [6,11]. Similarly, the
scaly tree ferns (Cyatheaceae) also radiated very recently
and diversified at an exceptionally high rate [13]. A comparison of the complete cp genome sequences between
Alsophila and the polypod fern Adiantum will aid interpre-

Currently, one limiting factor in comparative chloroplast
genomics is the sparse taxon sampling in spore-bearing land
plants. The representation of genome sequencing almost
always favors plants of economic interest [5]. Complete cp
genomes have been sequenced for more than one hundred
seed plants. Amongst these, more than 10 completed
sequences each are from cereals (13), crucifers (12) and conifers (12) respectively (see Additional file 1). But for other
land plants, excluding seed plants, only 10 cp genome
sequences have been achieved in total, of which only 3 are
from ferns prior this study (see Additional file 1). For further
insights into the evolutionary dynamics of cp genome organization, more data from plant species representative of other
crucial evolutionary nodes is needed [5].

Results and Discussion

single copy (LSC) region of 86,308 bp separated from a
21,623-bp small single copy (SSC) region by two inverted
repeats (IRs), each of 24,365 bp (Figure 1). The genome is
the largest amongst the four sequenced fern cp genomes
(Table 1), but is smaller than previous estimates of other
Cyatheaceae species, e.g. Alsophila bryophila (165 kb),
Cyathea furfuracea (179.2 kb) and Sphaeropteris cooperi
(164.3 kb), using the mapping method [14]. When the IR
is considered only once, the Alsophila cp genome contains
117 genes, encoding 85 proteins, 4 rRNAs and 28 tRNAs
(Table 1). Pseudogenes of ycf66 and trnT-UGU were also
detected in this genome (Figure 1). More than half of the
Alsophila cp genome is composed of coding regions
(92,691 bp, 59.17%) with the protein-coding regions
accounting for the major portion (81,111 bp, 51.77%)
followed by rRNA genes (9,086 bp, 5.80%) and tRNA
genes (2,494 bp, 1.59%) (counting both IRs).

General Features
The chloroplast (cp) genome of Alsophila spinulosa [GenBank: FJ556581] is 156,661 base pairs (bp) with a large

The Alsophila cp genome has an overall GC content of
40.43%, which is lower only than Adiantum capillus-veneris

Moreover, sequences of all four published fern cp
genomes (including that of Alsophila) will enable more
detailed comparisons of the organization and evolution
of the chloroplast genomes in ferns. Our comparative
analyses corroborate that fern cp genomes have undergone substantial changes in gene orders during evolution:
two main rearrangements contribute to major differences
between "higher" and basal ferns. In addition, the comparisons also identify some unique characteristics in the
Alsophila cp genome including a novel tRNA, interesting
pseudogenes and a highly repeated 565-bp-region spanning one endpoint of an ancient inversion.

amongst the four sequenced fern cp genomes (Table 1)
and is the fourth highest amongst sequenced land plant cp
genomes (see Additional file 1). Like other land plants
[15,16], GC content is unevenly distributed across the
Alsophila cp genome by location, functional group and
codon position. The GC content in rRNA genes (55.18%)
and tRNA genes (54.55%) is much higher than in protein
coding regions (40.87%). The GC percentage in IRs is the
highest (Table 1), reflecting the high GC content of rRNA
genes. Amongst the protein genes, photosynthetic genes
possess the highest GC content (43.85%), followed by
genetic system genes (40.80%), whilst NADH genes have
the least (39.54%). The GC content also varies by codon
position with the first (47.75%) > second (40.94%) >
third (33.91%) position in turn.
The start codons of 85 protein genes were inferred by
comparisons with previously annotated land plant cp
genomes. Sixty-three of these genes start with AUG, 20
with ACG and 2 with GUG (psbC and rps12). An ACG
codon may be restored to a canonical start codon (AUG)
by RNA editing, whereas a GUG initiation codon has been
reported in other cp genomes [17,18]. Inferring translation start positions based only on genome sequences is
merely hypothetical [10]. Future determination of
sequences from complementary DNA (cDNA) and/or
proteins will help to substantiate the putative translation
start positions as well as RNA editing sites.
There are in total 27,046 codons in all protein coding
regions (including coding regions in both IRs) (Table 2),
representing the total coding capacity of the Alsophila cp
genome; of these, 2771 (10.25%) are for leucine, 2365
(8.74%) for serine, 2154 (7.96%) for isoleucine, and
1847 (6.83%) for glycine. One third of the total codons

are represented by these four amino acids. The codon
usage of the Alsophila cp genome reflects an apparent AT
bias. Most codons end in A or U (66.13%). As shown in
figure 2, both codon numbers and RSCU (Relative Synonymous Codon Usage) values are negatively correlated
with codon GC content (represented by the number of
G+C in a given codon). It appears that nucleotide composition bias has a significant influence on codon usage.
Gene order
The Alsophila cp genome shares three key inversions with
other ferns relative to bryophytes (Figure 3): 1) a 30-kb
inversion at the beginning of LSC (close to IRA) [2]; 2) an
approximately 3 kb inversion involving trnT, psbD, psbC,
trnS, psbZ and trnG [8,10,19]; and 3) a minor inversion
containing a single gene trnD-GUC. The first of these
inversions is also shared by all vascular plants except lycophytes, whereas the latter two are restricted to ferns.

To our knowledge, the trnD-GUC inversion has not been
previously documented. Three conserved and consecutive
tRNA genes, trnD-GUC, trnY-GUA and trnE-UUC, have
been identified in all land plant cp genomes. Excluding
ferns, the three genes have the same directions of transcription. However, in ferns trnD is inverted relative to
trnY and trnE (Figure 3). The simplest interpretation of
this change is a single minor inversion involving only
trnD. Based on current data, it remains unknown whether
the 3-kb inversion or the trnD inversion occurred first in
ferns.
Overall, the Alsophila cp genome shows a high degree of
synteny with the previously sequenced cp genome of Adiantum (Figure 4A). In contrast, there exist striking differences between Alsophila and Angiopteris (Figure 4B) as well

as between Alsophila and Psilotum (Figure 4C). A set of
complex rearrangements in the IRs, involving a rare duplication of psbA gene, was found in "higher" ferns using
physical mapping [3,4]. The IR gene orders of "higher"
ferns, such as Adiantum, Cyathea and Polystichum, are
highly rearranged in comparison to that of basal leptosporangiate Osmunda [3,4,20]. Complete cp genome data

from Angiopteris, Psilotum, Adiantum and Alsophila detail
these rearrangements. The IR gene order in Alsophila
appears to be the same as that in Adiantum, while Angiopteris and Psilotum have the Osmunda gene order. To explain
the complex rearrangements, a "two inversions" hypothesis was proposed [20]. Figure 5 illustrates the great gene
order changes within these rearrangements and the

updated version of the "two inversions" model incorporating gene order data from the Alsophila and Angiopteris cp
genomes. Recently, Wolf and Roper [9] indicated that the
two major inversions did occur in turn and the second
inversion (Figure 5, Inversion II) took place on the branch
leading to the common ancestor of the heterosporous fern
clade and its sister group. Thus, it seems reasonable to
hypothesize that the Adiantum gene order represents a
common feature of the three lineages within core leptosporangiates (including heterosporous ferns, tree ferns
and polypod ferns).

Gene content
A total of 117 different genes are present in the Alsophila
cp genome (Table 1). This gene content is similar to that
of most land plants [21]. However, there are some interesting differences amongst the four sequenced fern cp
genomes (Table 3). The Alsophila cp genome possesses the
least number of tRNA genes due to 5 missing tRNA genes
in comparison to basal ferns (Psilotum nudum and Angiopteris evecta). Its protein gene number is equal to that of
Angiopteris, but higher than that of both Adiantum and Psilotum. Details of these differences are discussed below.

Interestingly, in the Adiantum cp genome, an intron-containing trnT-UGU was identified between trnR-ACG and
ndhB (Table 3) [10]. The Alsophila cp genome possesses no
intact intron-containing trnT. However, two fragments
that are similar to the two exons within the Adiantum trnT
were annotated as a ΨtrnT-UGU in this study (Table 3).
This new trnT or ΨtrnT is just at one endpoint of the Inversion II (Figure 5). Therefore, the generation of intron-containing trnT-UGU may be associated with the IR
rearrangements.

Novel tRNA gene
A unique trnR-UCG gene, encoding tRNA-Arg, is found
between rbcL and accD in the Alsophila cp genome (Figure
1; Table 3). Another type of tRNA-Arg gene trnR-CCG
resides in the same locus in non-flowering land plants
including Angiopteris [8] and Psilotum [19]. In Adiantum, an
apparent tRNA gene is annotated as trnSeC [10]. It is uncertain whether the occurrence of trnR-UCG in the Alsophila cp
genome represents a unique feature for this species or is an
apomorphy for a larger clade such as Cyatheaceae or tree
ferns. To address this question, we collected all fern rbcLaccD intergenic sequences deposited in GenBank and
examined the tRNA genes within them using ARAGORN
[22]. The results indicate that trnR-UCG is restricted to tree
ferns, whereas trnR-CCG is widespread in non-core leptosporangiates and basal ferns (Table 4). However, neither
trnR-UCG nor the trnR-CCG gene is identified at this locus
in polypod ferns. Therefore, the existence of trnR-UCG may
reflect a putative molecular apomorphy of tree ferns.

Alsophila and Adiantum share another rearranged region
between rpoB and psbZ in LSC relative to Angiopteris and
Psilotum (Figure 3). For the latter two, gene order in this
region is "rpoB-trnC-petN-psbM-trnD-trnY-trnE-trnGpsbZ", whereas in Alsophila and Adiantum it is "rpoB-trnDtrnY-trnE-psbM-petN-trnC-trnG-psbZ" (Genes with boldface are unchanged) (Figure 3). Roper et al. [8] noted that
this gene order change is not caused by a single inversion.
Two alternative pathways may account for this rearrangement (Figure 6), but more data are needed to determine
the order of the two inversions.

Sequence alignment indicates that trnR-UCG and trnRCCGs have quite similar primary sequences with 44 of 74

41 and 40 identical nucleotides with the Alsophila trnRUCG, the Psilotum trnR-CCG and the Angiopteris trnR-CCG
respectively (Figure 7A). Due to their similarities and conserved loci, we propose that Alsophila trnR-UCG, Adiantum

trnSeC as well as trnR-CCGs in other land plants are
orthologous. Tree fern trnR-UCG can transfer arginine
even though its anticodon alters from CCG to UCG. However, Adiantum trnSeC has undergone major changes: 1)
its anticodon is UCA (unmatchable for an Arg codon),
and 2) it contains up to 18 nucleotide differences relative

to all other land plant trnR genes (Figure 7A). Our findings imply that the trnR-UCG is derived from the trnRCCG by the alteration of one anticodon base; then the
Adiantum trnSeC evolves from the trnR-UCG by altering
one anticodon base further, becoming a trnR-UCG pseudogene (Figure 7B). If this is the case, the Adiantum trnSeC
should be annotated as ΨtrnR. Sugiura and Sugita [23]
argued that the trnR-CCG is not essential for plastid function although it is conserved in non-flowering plants. The
evolutionary scenario of trnR-CCG in ferns (Figure 7B)
tends to support this view.
At the locus between rps4 and ndhJ, the Alsophila and Adiantum cp genomes encode a trnL-CAA (tRNA-Leu) rather
than a trnL-UAA gene (Table 3). However, they lose
another trnL-CAA gene (Table 3), which is found at the 3'
downstream of ndhB in almost all other land plant plastid
genomes. Consequently, Alsophila and Adiantum only possess the trnL-CAA, whereas the Angiopteris and Psilotum cp
genomes contain both the trnL-UAA and the trnL-CAA. In
the Adiantum chloroplast, the missing trnL-UAA could be
provided for the heavily used UUA codon by a partial Cto-U edit in the trnL-CAA anticodon [24]. Since the UUA
is also a preferred leucine codon for the Alsophila cp
genome (RSCU = 1.70), the same editing event might
occur in the Alsophila chloroplast as well.
Missing tRNA gene
Only 28 tRNA genes are encoded in the Alsophila cp
genome, whereas 29, 32 and 33 are annotated in Adian-

tum, Angiopteris and Psilotum, respectively (Table 1). For cp
genomes, it is believed that a set of 30 tRNA species is sufficient for the translation of chloroplast mRNAs [25]. In
the Angiopteris and Psilotum chloroplasts, tRNAs can read
all codons by using two-out-of-three and wobble mechanisms [26]. However, in Alsophila and Adiantum chloroplasts, both lysine codons lack a corresponding tRNA-Lys
(encoded by trnK) (Table 2; Table 3). The loss of trnK suggests cytosolic tRNAs may be imported into chloroplasts,
despite a lack of experimental evidence [27]. As an
incidental consequence of the trnK loss, the matk
open reading frame (ORF) is not nested in the trnK intron
(Figure 1).
Apart from the trnK and the trnL-CAA, the Alsophila cp
genome also shares other 3 tRNA gene losses, including
the trnS-CGA, the trnV-GAC and the trnT-UGU (intronfree), with Adiantum relative to basal ferns Angiopteris and
Psilotum (Table 3). The shared absence of tRNA genes
between Alsophila and Adiantum suggests that they may
derive from a common ancestor.
Protein genes
The Alsophila cp genome contains a psaM gene encoding
photosystem I reaction center subunit M. This gene has
been detected in Psilotum [19] and Angiopteris [8], but not
in Adiantum [10] (Table 3). Besides ferns, psaM also exists
in bryophytes, lycophytes and gymnosperms, but not in
angiosperms, implying its independent loss in ferns and
angiosperms [10]. Alsophila and Adiantum represent tree

Huperzia lucidula (lycophytes). The findings suggest that
ycf66 is lost independently in multiple clades of land
plants including hornworts, ferns and seed plants.

ferns and polypods, respectively. Due to their sister relationship, we speculate that the loss of psaM in ferns
occurred after the split of polypods and tree ferns.
A putative pseudogene of ycf66 is identified in the
Alsophila cp genome (Figure 1; Table 3). The 5' ends of its
two exons are both destroyed. In the four sequenced fern
cp genomes, only Angiopteris contains an intact ycf66 gene
[8]. For other land plants, this gene only occurs in Marchantia polymorpha (liverworts), Physcomitrella patens
subsp.patens (mosses),Syntrichia ruralis (mosses) and

Inversion Endpoint as Hotspot for Repeats
A total of 133 pairs of repeats (≥ 30 bp) were identified in
the Alsophila cp genome by using REPuter [28], of which
106 are direct and 27 are inverted repeats. This number of
repeats is less than are found in some highly rearranged cp
genomes (e.g. Trachelium caeruleum) but more than are
present in unrearranged ones (e.g. Nicotiana tabacum)
[29,30]. Up to 66 direct repeats (no inverted repeat) are
restricted to a region spanning only 565 bp (153,682–
154,246 bp in IRA or 88,724–89,288 bp in IRB) between
trnR-ACG and ψtrnT-UGU in the IRs (Figure 1). The GC
content of this 565-bp-region (35.93%) is lower than that
of IRs and the overall GC content of the whole genome.
Detailed sequence analyses revealed that this region is
composed of tandem iterations of 11 similar segments
ranging from 40 to 58 bp (Figure 8). The core repeated
motif is AAAATCCTAGTAGTTAgaGCTTTATCcaGGGtaTaGgACT (the lowercase letters denote variable bases) with
variant lengths of heads and/or tails (Figure 8).

In contrast to Alsophila, dispersed repeats (≥ 30 bp) are
rare in the Adiantum cp genome, with only 5 short
inverted repeats (30–36 bp); and none of these occurs
between the trnR-ACG and the trnT-UGU. In the Alsophila
cp genome, the length of the intergenic region between
trnR-ACG and ψtrnT-UGU is 1467 bp, whereas in Adiantum it is 913 bp, the difference being 554 bp. We noted
that this length is very similar to that of the highly
repeated 565-bp-region, and speculate that the difference
is caused by the presence of the highly repeated region. To
test this hypothesis, we extracted the sequence from trnRACG to ψtrnT-UGU in Alsophila and from trnR-ACG to
trnT-UGU in Adiantum. The sequence alignment indicates
that the highly repeated 565-bp-region is indeed lost in
the Adiantum cp genome (Figure 9).

Similarities between aligned regions are shown as average percent identity. The cluster of arrows denotes the location of the
highly repeated 565-bp-region in the Alsophila cp genome. *, an intact trnT-UGU was identified in Adiantum, while a trnT-UGU
pseudogene was found in Alsophila.

In the Alsophila cp genome, the location of the highly
repeated 565-bp-region is exactly at the endpoint of the
second inversion of the IR rearrangements (Figure 5,
Inversion II). Dispersed repeated sequences have been
reported from several cp genomes. These are associated
with numerous DNA rearrangements, particularly inversions [31-33]. In extensively rearranged cp genomes, the
endpoints of rearranged gene clusters are usually flanked
by repeated sequences [29,30,34]. If repeat-mediated
recombination is the major mechanism generating inversions in cp genomes [35,36], the preservation of repeats
would destabilize the genome structure. After inversions,
the repeats should be deleted to guarantee genome stability (like the situation in Adiantum). The repeats observed
at the endpoint of the ancient inversion (Figure 5, Inversion II) may be a vestige of recent rearrangement(s) that
are undiscovered. The existence of these repeats implies
that the region is a potential hotspot for genomic reconfiguration.

Conclusion
In this study, we present the first complete cp genome
sequence from a tree fern and provide a comprehensive
comparative analysis of cp genomes in ferns. The cp
genome size of Alsophila is larger than that of Adiantum,
Psilotum and Angiopteris. Besides 117 genes, two pseudogenes Ψycf66 and ΨtrnT-UGU are also detected in the
Alsophila cp genome. An intact ycf66 is identified in Angiopteris, while an intron-containing trnT-UGU is found in
Adiantum. Based on the findings, we speculate that Ψycf66
reflects an intermediate during ycf66 gene loss, and the
genesis of trnT-UGU may be associated with the IR rearrangements. A trnR-UCG gene was detected between rbcL
and accD in Alsophila, and this seems to be a molecular

apomorphy of tree ferns. In the Adiantum cp genome, the
trnR-UCG gene degenerates to a pseudogene. The Alsophila
cp genome shares several unusual characteristics with the
previously sequenced Adiantum (a polypod fern) cp
genome, such as five missing tRNA genes and two major
rearranged regions. These common characters probably
derive from their common ancestor. In the Alsophila cp
genome, a highly repeated 565-bp-region, which is composed of tandem iterations of 11 similar segments, occurs
at one endpoint of an ancient inversion, but it is not
detected in the genome of Adiantum. Nonetheless, the origin and function of these repeats remain to be characterized in future studies.

Methods
Genome sequencing and assembly
Young leaves of Alsophila spinulosa were collected from a
plant growing in the greenhouse in Wuhan Botanical Garden, Chinese Academy of Sciences. A voucher specimen
was deposited at Wuhan Botanical Garden. Total DNA
was extracted using the CTAB-based method [37]. The cp
genome was amplified using polymerase chain reaction
(PCR). In brief, the coding sequences were extracted from
known chloroplast genomic sequences of three ferns
[GenBank: NC_003386, NC_008829 and NC_004766],
three bryophytes [GenBank: NC_001319, NC_005087
and NC_004543] and one lycophyte [GenBank:
NC_006861] according to their annotations in GenBank.
PCR primers were developed from alignments of the
above coding sequences. Overlapping regions of each pair
of adjacent PCR fragments exceeded 150 bp. We did not
clone two inverted repeats (IRs) separately, but designed
primers to amplify the regions spanning the junctions of
LSC/IRA, LSC/IRB, SSC/IRA and SSC/IRB. Using these

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:130

primers, we covered the entire cp genome of Alsophila with
PCR products ranging in size from 500 bp to 5 kb. All PCR
reactions were performed using TaKaRa LA taq (TaKaRa
Bio Inc, Shiga, Japan). Amplified cp genome fragments
were cloned into TaKaRa pMD19-T plasmids (TaKaRa Bio
Inc, Shiga, Japan), which were then used to transform E.
coli DH5α. Multiple (≥ 6) clones were randomly selected
and commercially sequenced using ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). For long fragments (> 1.4 kb), walking primers were designed based on
acquired sequences and used for sequencing remaining
sequences step by step. Gap regions (caused by unsuccessful PCR amplification or failed primer walking sequencing) were amplified using primers that flank the gaps,
then cloned and sequenced as above. From the individual
reads we excluded vector, primer and low-quality
sequences, then we assembled the reads using Phrap [38].
Since automated assembly methods cannot distinguish
two IRs, we input the reads as two parts and acquired two
large contigs, with each contig including one IR and its
adjacent partial large and small single copy (LSC and SSC)
regions. Then the two large contigs were manually assembled into the complete circular genome sequence.
Inverted repeats were identified through alignment of the
final complete genome sequence against itself via Blast 2
sequences at the National Center for Biotechnology Information [39]. We accumulated 1,415,559 bp sequences,
which is about 9-fold coverage.
Annotation and related study
Annotation of the Alsophila cp genome was performed
using DOGMA (Dual Organellar GenoMe Annotator)
[40]. Genes that were undetected by DOGMA, such as
ycf1, ycf2, rps16, ndhF, ndhG and matK, were identified by
Blastx http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi. From this
initial annotation, putative starts, stops, and intron positions were determined by comparisons with homologous
genes in other cp genomes and by considering the possibility of RNA editing, which can modify the start and stop
positions. tRNA genes were annotated using DOGMA and
ARAGORN v1.2 http://130.235.46.10/ARAGORN/[22],
and then confirmed by ERPIN http://tagc.univ-mrs.fr/
erpin/[41] and TFAM Webserver v1.3 [42]. The circular
gene map of the Alsophila cp genome was drawn by
GenomeVx [43] followed by manual modification.

Synteny among fern cp genomes was analyzed and visualized by using online zPicture software http://zpic
ture.dcode.org/[44].
Examination of GC content
Overall GC content was calculated for 118 land plant plastid genomes (see Additional file 1). For the Alsophila cp
genome, GC content was farther determined for three
groups of genes, protein-coding genes (85), rRNA genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/130

(4) and tRNA genes (28), respectively. For protein-coding
genes, GC content was calculated for the entire gene and
the first, second and third codon positions, respectively.
Protein-coding genes were partitioned into three main
functional groups: photosynthetic genes, genetic system
genes and NADH genes. GC content of the three groups of
genes was then determined. The genes included in each of
these three groups were: (1) photosynthetic genes (rbcL,
atp*, pet*, psa* and psb*); (2) genetic system genes (rpl*,
rps*, rpo*, clpP, infA and matK); and (3) NADH genes
(ndh*).
Dispersed repeats
Direct and inverted repeats in the Alsophila and Adiantum
[GenBank: NC_004766] cp genomes were determined by
using REPuter [28] at a repeat length ≥ 30 bp with a Hamming distance of 3. The entire genome was used to detect
repeats in order to map them in both copies of the IR, but
numbers of repeats were based on results from only one
IR copy.
