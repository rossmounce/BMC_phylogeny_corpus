Abstract
Background: Men having sex with men (MSM) accounts for 33.6% of all reported cases of HIV-1 infection in
Taiwan. The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of HIV-1 infection among MSM in gay saunas in
Taiwan.
Methods: Patrons of 5 gay saunas were recruited for a weekly volunteer counseling and testing program from
2001 to 2005. Questionnaires were collected for a risk factor analysis. HIV-1 subtypes were determined using DNA
sequencing and phylogenetic analyses.
Results: HIV-1 prevalence rates among MSM in gay saunas in 2001 through 2005 were 3.4%, 5.1%, 8.9%, 8.5%, and
8.3%, respectively. In total, 81 of 1, 093 (7.4%) MSM had HIV-1 infection. Fifty-two HIV-1 strains were genotyped,
and all of them were subtype B. HIV-seropositive men were significantly younger than the seronegatives. Only
37.1% used condoms every time during sexual intercourse. A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that
the risk factors for HIV-1 were being uncircumcised (odds ratio (OR) = 2.19; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08~4.45);
having sexual intercourse with at least 2 partners during each sauna visit (≥ 2 vs. ≤ 1, OR = 1.71; 95% CI,
1.02~2.89); and the role played during anal intercourse (versatile vs. an exclusively insertive role, OR = 2.76; 95% CI,
1.42~5.36).
Conclusions: Overall, 7.4% Taiwanese MSM participating in this study had HIV-1 subtype B infection.
Uncircumcised, being versatile role during anal intercourse, and having sex with more than one person during
each sauna visit were main risk factors for HIV-1 infection.

Background
Since the global outbreak of HIV/AIDS, HIV has been
transmitted among different vulnerable populations.
According to a recent review, the global trend of HIV-1
infection among men having sex with men (MSM) has
continued to increase, especially in East Asia, Africa,
and Russia [1]. As of September 2011, there were 22,
335 known cases of HIV infection in Taiwan, and Taiwanese nationals accounted for 96.5% of those cases. Of
the Taiwanese nationals, 92.5% were male. Populations
at risk for HIV infection include injection drug users

(30.4%), homosexual men (38.3%), heterosexual men
(21.6%), and bisexual men (8.1%). Therefore, MSM are a
high risk group for HIV infection in Taiwan [2].
Since 1996~1997, the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has significantly decreased HIV/
AIDS-related mortality [3]. It has been reported that
unprotected sex has increased among MSM after the
introduction of HAART, which has resulted in dramatic
decreases in the morbidity and mortality from HIV-1
infection [4]. Taiwan began to provide free HAART to
all HIV-1/AIDS patients in April 1997 [5,6]. Although
successful HAART can reduce the contagiousness of
HIV-1, the fact that HIV-1 transmission still occurs in
the ART-era indicates that transmission occurs from

undiagnosed, untreated, or unsuccessfully treated
patients [7].
Risks factors for HIV-1 infection in MSM include
unprotected anal intercourse [8-10], multiple sexual
partners [11], a history of drug use [12-14], a history of
commercial sexual transactions [11,15], and a history of
other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) [1]. In Taiwan, homosexuals usually gather in parks, gay bars, and
gay saunas, and because gay saunas provide the opportunity for sexual intercourse, individuals who frequent
saunas are at a high risk of contracting STDs. Therefore,
gay saunas are an ideal place for voluntary counseling
and testing for HIV-1 infection [16]. The aims of this
study were (1) to determine the prevalence and trends
of HIV-1 infection among MSM frequenting gay saunas
from 2001 to 2005; (2) to identify the risk factors associated with HIV-1 infection; and (3) to determine the
viral subtypes of HIV-1 strains found in MSM in
Taiwan.

Methods
Participants

Before beginning the study, we contacted gay saunas in
Taipei, Hsinchu, and Taichung to inquire as to their
willingness to cooperate in participant recruitment.
Anonymous HIV testing and education were provided
during peak hours on weekends. Blood samples were
obtained by venipuncture in private rooms. A single
participant was interviewed at a time.
Gay saunas in Taipei were visited every other weekend, while those in Hsinchu and Taichung were visited
once a month. All recruited participants provided blood
samples, and they could choose whether or not to complete a questionnaire. This research study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of National YangMing University. Before testing for HIV-1/2 antibodies,
researchers provided the necessary counseling. Test
results were available 2 weeks after the blood samples
were obtained. Participants with negative results were
encouraged to undergo follow-up screening every 6
months, while participants with positive results were
initially counseled by a professional social worker and
referred to a hospital for further counseling. Positive
blood samples then underwent HIV-1 subtyping.
HIV-1 Screening, Subtyping, and Phylogenetic Analysis

Participants provided 5~10 ml of peripheral blood for
HIV-1 antibody testing and subtyping. Recombinant
HIV-1/HIV-2 EIA (Murex Diagnostics Limited, Dartford, UK) was used for HIV screening. Positive samples
were reconfirmed by HIV Western blot 2.2 (Genelabs,
Singapore). A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
was used to determine the gag and env subtypes [17].
Sequence alignments with different subtype reference

sequences from the Los Alamos HIV database (available
at: http://www.hiv.lanl.gov) were conducted using the
BioEdit program (vers. 7.0.9) [18]. Phylogenetic trees
were constructed using the Neighbor-joining (NJ) and
maximum-likelihood (ML) methods using the MEGA
program (vers. 5.0) [19]. The General Time Reversible
(GTR)+G+I substitution model was the best fitting
model as tested using MEGA5 Bayesian information criterion (BIC) scores, the corrected Akaike information
criterion (AIC) value, and the maximum-likelihood
value (lnL). The gamma distribution shape parameter
(G) was 1.0342. The robustness of the phylogenetic
trees was statistically evaluated by a bootstrap analysis
with 1000 bootstrap samples.
Statistical Analysis

Pearson’s c2 test and Fisher’s exact test were performed
in a univariate analysis to investigate differences in
demographic data and consumer behavior patterns
among MSM. Student’s t-test or an analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was conducted to examine age differences. A
multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed
to identify risk factors associated with HIV-1 infection.
Nucleotide Sequence Accession Numbers

HIV-1 env sequences obtained in this study were deposited in GenBank with the accession numbers
JN631752~JN631791.

Results
Between 2001 and 2005, 1, 093 participants (81 HIV-1
positive and 1, 012 HIV-1 negative) participated in this
study. The positive rates of HIV-1 and syphilis were
7.4% and 7.6%, respectively. A trend analysis showed
that HIV-1 positive rates significantly increased from
3.4% in 2001 to 6.1% in 2002, and to 8.9% in 2003 (p =
0.031). Then, it reached a plateau at 8.5% in 2004 and
8.4% in 2005. In contrast, 2 peaks syphilis infection rates
were seen in 2002 and 2005 (Table 1).
The mean age of participants was 32.4 (SD, 8.1) years,
with a range of 17~81 years. Among participants,

54.87% had a high school degree, and 91.7% were single
(Additional file 1). Significant differences were found
between participants who brought their own condoms
to the sauna every visit (79.5% HIV-1 positive vs. 66.9%
HIV-1 negative, p < 0.05). Among those who did not
bring their own condoms, more HIV-1-positive participants than their counterparts purchased condoms from
the counter (53.3% vs. 39.1%, p < 0.05) (Additional file
2).
HIV-1-positive participants had sexual intercourse
with more people in a 3-month period on average than
their counterparts (4.8 ± 5.1 vs. 4.0 ± 6.4, p < 0.05).
More HIV-1-negative than HIV-1-positive participants
had insertive roles (35.9% vs. 19.5%). Overall, 27% of
study participants were circumcised, including 16.5%
HIV-1-positive and 26.8% HIV-1-negative participants
(p = 0.045) (Additional file 3). The major reasons for
testing or not were shown in Additional file 4. Nineteen
percent of the study participants had an STD history
(Additional file 5).
According to univariate logistic regression, several factors were associated with HIV-1 infection, they included:
those with versatile roles (OR = 2.55, 95% CI =
1.41~4.61), those performing anal intercourse (OR =
2.73, 95% CI = 1.08~6.86), those performing anal rimming (OR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.24~3.34), those having sex
with at least 2 partners per visit (OR = 1.73, 95% CI =
1.08~2.80), being uncircumcised (OR = 1.85, 95% CI =
1.01~3.42), and those aged under 35 years (OR = 2.70,
95% CI = 1.07~6.79), as shown in Table 2.
Results from stepwise multivariate logistic regression
analysis indicated that those with versatile roles (OR =
2.76, 95% CI = 1.42~5.36), those had sexual intercourse
with at least 2 men during each visit (OR = 1.71, 95%
CI = 1.02~2.89), being uncircumcised (OR = 2.19, 95%
CI = 1.08~4.45) were related to HIV-1 infection (Table
3).
Consistent tree topologies were observed in both the
NJ and ML trees. Analysis of the env subtype in 52
HIV-1-positive participants showed that all participants
had subtype B (Additional file 6). Results showed that
some HIV-1 strains from gay saunas and Venereal Disease Control Institute (VDCI) clustered with bootstrap
values of > 85%.

Discussion
According to the Centers for Disease Control, in 2009,
the HIV-positive rate based on screening at major hospitals, blood centers, military bases, and prisons was
54.96/100, 000 (1651/3, 003, 735) [2]. In this study, we
screened 1, 093 participants and found a syphilis-positive rate of 7.6% and a HIV-1-positive rate of 7.4%,
which were significantly higher than those reported by
the Centers for Disease Control.

From a physiological point of view, the strong diffusion capabilities of the rectum facilitate HIV infection
[20]. Analysis by the number of sexual partners showed
a direct correlation between the number of sexual partners and the probability of HIV infection [21]. In addition, condom use can significantly decrease propagation
of the HIV virus. In this study, over 80% of study participants had anal intercourse, which was comparable to
the 71.4% reported by Ko et al. in 1997 [21]. The percentage of participants wore a condom every time and
for the entire duration of sexual intercourse (Additional
file 3) was similar to that reported by Ko et al. [21], suggesting that through the years, the proportion of homosexuals performing anal intercourse has remained
unchanged and the proportion of condom use has
remained low.
Frequent visits to saunas increase the probability of
contracting STDs [16]. Participants in our study had a
higher rate of STDs, and participants with STDs are
more susceptible to HIV infection (Additional file 5).
The route of STD transmission is a risk factor for HIV
infection and that STDs increase the HIV infection rate
2~5-fold [22]. A stepwise multiple regression analysis
revealed that role played during anal intercourse, the
number of sexual partners during each sauna visit, and
the circumcision status were risk factors associated with
HIV-1 infection in MSM frequenting gay saunas. These
were also found to be risk factors in other countries
[16,22].
Male circumcision is a religious commandment in
Judaism and Islam. The world prevalence of men with
circumcision is 12.5%~33%, and is especially high in the
USA, Canada, and Africa and among Islamic people
[23]. Approximately 80% of US men are circumcised
[24], in which white males had the highest prevalence (>
70%) and Hispanics had the lowest prevalence (≤ 40%)
[25]. Ko et al. reported that the prevalence of circumcision in Taiwan was 7.2%~8.7% [26]. In this study, our
findings indicated that circumcision of MSM provides a
certain degree of protection against HIV-1 infection.
Previous studies showed that male circumcision reduced
the likelihood of female-to-male transmission of HIV-1
infection by 50%~60% [27-29]. Concerning the protective effect of circumcision for MSM, several studies
reported that circumcision had a significant protective
effect [30-33]. In contrast, other studies reported that
circumcised MSM had greater chances for contracting
HIV infection although they were statistically nonsignificant [34,35]. Since Buddhism and Taoism are the two
main religions in Taiwan (44.5% and 24.1%, respectively), while Christianity and Islam populations are relatively small (10% and 1%, respectively) [36], religion
might not have been a confounder in this study.

was revealed when the number of new HIV-infected
homosexuals increased from 571 (17% of all new HIVinfected) in 2005 to 1, 275 (71%) in 2010 [37]. Circumcision may be one of the approaches that should be
adapted to control the epidemic of HIV-1 infection
among Taiwanese MSM in the future.
HIV screening among high-risk group is cost-effective.
Unlinked anonymous testing can provide high-risk individuals with a secure means of testing and can prevent a
selection bias [38]. In this study, we performed purposive sampling and snowballing in order to increase the
sample size [39]. However, because the sampling was
not random, results from this study cannot be used to
represent the prevalence of HIV infection in gay sauna
patrons or of the general MSM population across Taiwan. In addition, because the screening was anonymous,
most participants used aliases, and only a few participants agreed to be followed-up. This hindered our follow-up efforts and impeded us from estimating the
incidence in a cohort study. The seropositive rate in this
study was high. We therefore suggest that future studies
expand the sampling area and survey other places where
MSM congregate so as to estimate the size of the MSM
population and thereby fully monitor trends of the HIV
virus in this high-risk population.

Conclusions
Of MSM participating in this study, 7.4% (81/1093) were
infected with HIV-1, and all of them had subtype B. The
circumcision status, the role played during anal intercourse, and the number of sexual partners during each
sauna visit were the three main risk factors for HIV-1
infection.
This study accessed gay saunas to obtain a deeper
understanding of the sexual behavior of MSM in Taiwan. Results from this study can serve as a reference for
researchers interested in these behavioral patterns and
for local authorities promoting health education among
MSM.
