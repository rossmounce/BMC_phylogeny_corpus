Abstract
Background: Lateral gene transfer can introduce genes with novel functions into genomes or
replace genes with functionally similar orthologs or paralogs. Here we present a study of the
occurrence of the latter gene replacement phenomenon in the four gene families encoding different
classes of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), to evaluate and compare the patterns and rates of
lateral gene transfer (LGT) in prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
Results: We extend the taxon sampling of gdh genes with nine new eukaryotic sequences and
examine the phylogenetic distribution pattern of the various GDH classes in combination with
maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses. The distribution pattern analyses indicate that LGT has
played a significant role in the evolution of the four gdh gene families. Indeed, a number of gene
transfer events are identified by phylogenetic analyses, including numerous prokaryotic intradomain transfers, some prokaryotic inter-domain transfers and several inter-domain transfers
between prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes (protists).
Conclusion: LGT has apparently affected eukaryotes and prokaryotes to a similar extent within
the gdh gene families. In the absence of indications that the evolution of the gdh gene families is
radically different from other families, these results suggest that gene transfer might be an
important evolutionary mechanism in microbial eukaryote genome evolution.

Background
Lateral gene transfer (LGT) is a significant evolutionary
mechanism in prokaryotic genome evolution. Indeed, it
may be the most important mechanism for evolutionary
innovation in Eubacteria and Archaea [1,2]. However,
gene transfer events do not necessarily produce novel
functions in recipient lineages; many documented gene
transfers are replacements of genes by homologs or analogs with the same function [3,4]. The occurrence of LGT
has been far less studied in eukaryotes than prokaryotes,
partly because of the lack of complete genome sequences

available from diverse eukaryotes. Nevertheless, several
individual cases of gene transfer between prokaryotes and
eukaryotes have been published [for example: [5–8]]. We
recently presented an analysis which showed a number of
transfers involving eukaryotes, mostly in the prokaryoteto-eukaryote direction, but also between different eukaryotic lineages [9]. Collectively, these examples indicate that
LGT does affect protists, although the quantitative importance of the process in eukaryotic genome evolution
remains unclear [10,11]. We have selected the glutamate
dehydrogenase (gdh) gene families to investigate the

relative frequency of gene transfer in prokaryotic versus
eukaryotic genome evolution, to deepen our understanding of the extent to which gene transfer, in general, and
gene replacement, in particular, affects eukaryotes.
GDH catalyzes the reversible oxidative deamination of
glutamate to α-ketoglutarate and ammonia. These
enzymes are very diverse and can be divided into four distinct classes. GDH-1 and GDH-2 are small hexameric
enzymes with a broad taxonomic distribution that utilize
either NAD+ or NADP+ as a coenzyme and function
mainly in ammonia assimilation [12–14]. A class of larger
(115 kDa) GDHs (herein referred to as GDH-3), that have
previously been found only in fungi and protists, function
in glutamate catabolism. Finally, enzymes of a fourth class
(herein called GDH-4) have been recently discovered in
Eubacteria [14] that are approximately 180 kDa in size
and are NAD+ specific.
A number of groups have previously investigated the evolution of the GDH enzyme families. A decade ago it was
proposed that gdh1 and gdh2 originated via a single
ancient gene duplication and therefore these paralogs
could be used to root the universal tree of life [12]. However, as more gdh genes were collected, gene duplication
scenarios required that multitudes of gene duplications
and parallel loss events had to be invoked to explain the
phylogenetic patterns observed. Brown and Doolittle suggested that it was more likely that at least part of the
incongruity of GDH trees with organismal phylogeny
were caused by other evolutionary processes such as LGT
[13]. Phylogenetic analyses in a more recent study were
unfortunately based on an alignment of all four classes of
the enzyme, that are very distantly related, and did not
include any bootstrap support values [14], making them
difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, the phylogenetic distribution pattern of the different GDH classes between species and the phylogenetic analyses of the classes
themselves clearly indicated that gene transfer was likely
to be a significant evolutionary mechanism in the evolutionary history of these enzymes. Here we revisit these
issues using up-to-date taxon-rich datasets that include
novel sequences from eukaryotes. Our rigourous analyses
of the phylogenetic relationships within these gene families have identified a number of cases of gene replacements, affecting both eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
Analyses of the phylogenetic distribution of the four
classes of GDH across the tree of life complement and further support the conclusion that LGT was relatively frequent in the evolutionary history of the gdh gene families.

Results and Discussion
Nine new eukaryotic GDH sequences
All available homologs of GDH were downloaded from
public databases and some ongoing genome projects in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/14

order to study the evolution of gdh genes. As noted before
[12,14], GDH-1 is found in eubacteria and eukaryotes,
GDH-2 is found in all domains of life, and GDH-4 is only
found in eubacteria. However, we identified two GDH-3
genes from the δ-proteobacteria Desulfovibrio vulgaris and
Geobacter sulfurreducens; GDH-3 was previously found
only in eukaryotes including fungi, euglenozoa and apicomplexa [14].
In order to study the evolution of eukaryotic GDHs in
more detail, we also broadened the taxon sampling of gdh
genes amongst eukaryotes. Seven new GDH-1 and two
new GDH-2 sequences were obtained. GDH-1 and GDH2 cDNA clones from the red alga Porphyra yezoensis, GDH1 cDNA clones the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, the
diplomonad Spironucleus barkhanus, and the parabasalid
Trichomonas vaginalis, and a GDH-2 cDNA clone from the
green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were kindly made
available from the various EST projects [15–17] and fully
sequenced. GDH-1 sequences from the diplomonads
Spironucleus vortens and Hexamita inflata, and the parabasalid Monocercomonas sp. were obtained using degenerate
PCR.
Distribution of gdh genes among completely sequenced
genomes
The phylogenetic distribution pattern of the genes within
a gene family may provide indications of gene transfer
events within the family. If a gene is present in distantly
related organisms, but absent from many organisms that
are more closely related, either extensive parallel gene
losses or gene transfer events have to be inferred. The gene
loss scenario requires that the gene was present in the
ancestors of all the lineages that encode the genes.

We analyzed the pattern of the distribution of gdh genes
in the three domains of life by analyzing the presence or
absence of the four classes in all available completely
sequenced genomes (Table 1). All classes of gdh have been
found in eubacteria, all but gdh4 have been found in
eukaryotes, while only gdh2 has been found in Archaea.
gdh genes seem to be absent from some archaeal genomes
as well as some of the smaller eubacterial and eukaryotic
genomes. Among the organisms that do encode GDH,
one or two classes are represented – no genome has yet
been shown to encode three or all four classes (Table 1).
Except for the unique presence of gdh2 in Archaea, no
strong pattern that is correlated with organismal phylogeny can be observed for the distribution of gdh genes
(Table 1). For example, gdh genes encoding all four classes
of the enzyme are present in various proteobacterial
genomes. The distribution of the genes is scrambled even
within this eubacterial group; both α- and γ-proteobacterial groups have members that encode gdh1, gdh2 or gdh4,
or a combination of two of them (Table 1 and Figs. 1,2,3).

The Γ shape parameter, α, and the fraction of invariable sites, Pinv, were estimated to 1.10 and 0.08, respectively. The tree is

In the absence of gene transfer, this would require that the
ancestral proteobacterium encoded all four classes, and
the ancestors of α- and γ-proteobacteria encoded three
classes which have been differentially lost in different lineages. This scenario seems very unlikely given that no
sequenced extant genome contains more than two classes
(Table 1). On the other hand, LGT events from outside
proteobacteria, in combination with differential gene
losses, could easily explain the gene distribution pattern
within proteobacteria. For example, Salmonella typhimurium encodes both gdh1 and gdh2, while no other γ-proteobacteria encode gdh2 (Table 1). In this case, a recent
transfer event to the Salmonella lineage is a more parsimo-

nious explanation than a large number of parallel losses
of gdh2 within the γ-proteobacterial clade. Indeed, this
interpretation is supported by phylogenetic analysis – the
Salmonella sequence do not branch with any of the proteobacterial groups, which would be expected if the unique
presence of gdh2 in the Salmonella lineage amongst the γproteobacteria were due to losses in other lineages rather
than a transfer event (Fig. 2 and discussion below). In
conclusion, the weak correlation between eubacterial
organismal phylogeny and the distribution of gdh genes
(Table 1) indicates that LGT must have played a significant role in the evolution of this gene family, at least
among eubacteria.

The scarceness of complete genome sequences for eukaryotes makes it problematic to use phylogenetic distribution
patterns as evidence for, or against, gene transfer events
affecting eukaryotes. The apparent lack of a gene family
from an organism may simply reflect the incompleteness
of our knowledge of its genome. Nevertheless, even given
this incomplete knowledge, the distribution pattern of
gdh genes is difficult to reconcile with current accounts of
eukaryotic phylogeny. For example, metazoa and fungi
share a eukaryotic ancestor to the exclusion of many other
eukaryotic groups [18], but only gdh2 genes are found in
the complete metazoan genome sequences, while gdh1
and gdh3 genes are found in fungi (Table 1 and Figs.
1,2,3). One possible explanation for this pattern is that
the ancestor of fungi and metazoa encoded all three

classes with subsequent losses of gdh2 in the fungal lineage and gdh1 and gdh3 in the metazoan lineage. Alternatively, at least one gene transfer to the metazoan or the
fungal lineage could have occurred after their divergence
creating the observed distribution of the gdh gene
families. We favor the gene transfer scenario since no
eukaryote has yet been found to encode three gdh genes.
Improving the taxon sampling of gdh genes from the two
groups and their closest relatives combined with phylogenetic analyses should clarify this issue.
Phylogenetic analyses of GDH sequences
The observed distribution of gdh genes could, in principle,
always be explained by the presence of all families in a
common ancestor, followed by massive differential losses

of paralogs. Phylogenetic reconstructions are therefore
necessary to distinguish between this scenario and a situation whereby LGT created the scrambled distribution
pattern of gdh genes. Differential gene loss of ancient paralogs is expected to produce phylogenetic trees for each
family that broadly resemble the organismal phylogeny –
i.e. accepted monophyletic organismal groups, such as,
for example, proteobacteria and eukaryotes, should be
recovered. LGT events, on the other hand, are expected to
produce trees that are at odds with the expected organismal phylogenies.

phylogenetic signal in the dataset. In previous studies, the
different families of GDH have been aligned and combined phylogenetic analyses have been performed [12–
14]. However, only two of the families, GDH-1 and GDH2, can be unambiguously aligned over a significant part of
the molecules. Phylogenetic reconstructions that include
both families show a very long internal branch whose
placement within each subtree is dependent on the taxon
sampling within each family (data not shown). Therefore,
separate maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses for
each GDH family were performed (Figs. 1,2,3).

The inferred GDH amino acid sequences were aligned for
each class individually and unambiguously aligned
regions were identified. Closely related sequences from
different strains of the same species and closely related
species were excluded to decrease the computational time
for the analyses. Sequences with deviant amino acid composition were excluded to reduce the noise relative to the

Frequent eubacterial intra-domain LGTs
The GDH-1 and GDH-2 phylogenetic analyses strongly
indicate that LGT has played an important role in the evolution of these gene families. For example, proteobacterial
sequences are found in five groups in GDH-1, three of
which are separated with statistical support values >80%
in both bootstrap analyses, and five groups in GDH-2,

four of which separated with >85% bootstrap support in
both analyses (Figs. 1 & 2). In the GDH-1 phylogenetic
reconstruction the α-proteobacteria Sinorhizobium meliloti
groups with the high G+C gram positive Corynebacterium
glutamicum, and the γ-proteobacteria Pasteurella multicoda
and Salmonella typhimurium form a strong group with Deinococcus radiodurans and the unicellular eukaryote
Trypanosoma cruzi, to the exclusion of the other proteobacterial sequences in the tree (Fig. 1). Similarly, in the GDH2 reconstruction the α-proteobacteria Brucella melitensis
groups with two cyanobacterial sequences, while the two
other α-proteobacterial sequences group with a large
eukaryotic cluster. Also, the two β-proteobacterial
sequences fail to group together in the GDH-2 tree – one
is an immediate outgroup to a group with low G+C gram
positive sequences, while the other is in a strongly supported cluster with a γ-proteobacterial sequence and the
Deinococcus sequence (Fig. 2). Thus, several LGT events
involving other eubacterial groups as well as eukaryotes
have to be inferred to explain the distribution of the proteobacterial GDH sequences. The polyphyletic pattern is
not unique to proteobacteria within the eubacterial
domain; the three cyanobacterial GDH-2 sequences are
separated into two distinct clusters with bootstrap support
values of 99% and 95%, respectively (Fig. 2), and the low
G+C gram positives sequences are split into at least two
groups each for GDH-1 and GDH-2, albeit with slightly
weaker support from the bootstrap analyses (Figs. 1 & 2).
Taken together, the phylogenetic reconstructions strongly
support our predictions based on the distribution pattern
(Table 1) that there has been frequent LGT in the evolution of eubacterial GDH-1 and GDH-2.
LGT between the two prokaryotic domains
Only the GDH-2 gene family is found in Archaea (Table
1). At first glance, this might be taken as evidence that an
ancestral archaeon encoded this class of the gene and that
it was passed on to extant Archaea by vertical inheritance.
However, the phylogenetic analysis of GDH-2 argues
against this simple interpretation. The archaeal sequences
are split into three distinct groups (Fig. 2); the Thermoplasma and Thermococcus sequences form a cluster with a
cyanobacterial/α-proteobacterial group which is nested
within a cluster of low G+C gram positive eubacteria with
a bootstrap support value of 71% in the maximum likelihood analysis (Fig. 2), the crenarchaeote sequences group
with another cluster of low G+C gram positives with 74%
bootstrap support in the same analysis, and the Halobacterium and the Haloferax sequences form a group that is
excluded from the two other archaeal clusters. The support values for these bipartitions are much weaker in the
distance analysis, 18% and 24%, respectively. However,
the archaeal sequences were never recovered as a monophyletic cluster in any of the 500 bootstrap replicates with
either of the two methods. In fact, a cluster of the Thermo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/14

coccus/Thermoplasma and crenarchaeote sequences was the
only pairwise combination of the three archaeal groups
obtained in the optimal maximum likelihood tree (Fig. 2)
that was recovered in any of the bootstrap analyses; this
grouping was found in 0,6% and 0,4% of the replicates in
the maximum likelihood and distance analyses, respectively. Thus, the phylogenetic analysis fail to support the
indications from the distribution analysis that the
archaeal sequences are unaffected by gene transfer events.
Rather, the recovered tree suggests two independent LGT
events between eubacteria and archaea: one transfer
between the low G+C gram positive eubacterial lineage
and the crenarchaeotes, and another transfer to the Thermococcus/Thermoplasma lineage (Fig. 2).
Inter-domain LGT involving eukaryotes
The phylogenetic analysis of GDH-1 suggests that interdomain transfer may not be limited to prokaryotes – the
T. cruzi and the Entodinium caudatum sequences are phylogenetically distant from the other eukaryotic clusters
(Fig. 1). The Trypanosoma sequence forms a group with
two proteobacterial sequences and a Deinococcus
sequence, with a bootstrap support values of >90% for the
bipartition, indicative of a inter-domain gene transfer to
the kinetoplastid lineage from a eubacterial lineage, possibly a γ-proteobacterium (Fig. 1). A second LGT event has
to be inferred to explain the presence of a gdh1 gene
sequence in the ciliate E. caudatum which groups with
sequences from Bacteroides and Porphyromonas with a
bootstrap support values of >75% (Fig. 1). The phylogenetic analysis of GDH-1 suggests additional gene transfer
events; eukaryotes emerge in five different places in the
tree (Fig. 1). Unfortunately, the additional LGT events
implied by this branching pattern can neither be proved
nor disproved, since the backbone of the GDH-1 phylogenetic tree is poorly resolved. Three of the eukaryotic
groups – the plant/oomycete cluster, the large protist cluster and the fungi/red algal cluster – could indeed represent
a large eukaryotic GDH-1 group (Fig. 1).

Two eukaryotic groups are found in the GDH-2 phylogenetic tree, one cluster with two green algal sequences and
an Arabidopsis sequence, and a second larger cluster. As
mentioned, two α-proteobacterial sequences form a
strongly supported group with the larger eukaryotic
cluster (Fig. 2). This α-proteobacterial/eukaryotic cluster
is a sister to the green algal/land plant cluster. Several different evolutionary scenarios could have produced this
pattern. A gene transfer may have occurred from the common ancestor of metazoan, slime mold and ciliate
sequences to the α-proteobacterial lineage. In this case,
the eukaryote lineage would be one large clade with the
eubacterial grouping arising from within them.
Alternatively, this transfer event could have happened in
the opposite direction and the eukaryotic groups origi-

nated via one, or maybe two, gene transfer events from
eubacteria. If so, the transfer to the larger eukaryotic group
could, in principle, represent an endosymbiotic gene
transfer, since the ancestor of the mitochondria was an αproteobacterium. However, this scenario is problematic
for two reasons; α-proteobacterial sequences are also
found in another part of the GDH-2 tree, as well as in the
GDH-1 and GDH-4 trees (Figs. 1,2,3), and multiple independent losses in eukaryotic lineages have to be inferred.
Phylogeny of GDH-3 and GDH-4
The phylogenetic reconstructions of GDH-1 and GDH-2
in combination with the phylogenetic distribution analyses (Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 2) provide strong support for
multiple inter- and intra-domain gene transfer events. The
phylogeny of GDH-3 and GDH-4, on the other hand, fail
to indicate transfer events – all recovered clusters represent expected organismal groups (Fig. 3). However, this
should not be taken as evidence that these two classes
have never suffered LGT – the recovered organismal
groups are only distantly related. For example, the presence of gdh3 genes in eukaryotes, and δ-proteobacteria
among prokaryotes, indicates at least one transfer
between eubacteria and eukaryotes, unless an enormous
number of parallel losses of the gene are to be invoked
amongst eubacteria. Also, since fungi and Euglenozoa are
rather distantly related eukaryotic groups [18], either several independent losses of the gdh3 gene in other eukaryotic lineages must have occurred, or a gene transfer event
must be invoked (Fig. 3A). Similarly, the gdh4 gene is only
present in a few species that do not form one coherent
organismal group, which is indicative of intra-domain
LGT (Fig. 3B).
The relative rates of LGT may be comparable in
prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes
The strongest evidence for a gene transfer is a close phylogenetic relationship between gene sequences of distantly
related organisms to the exclusion of gene sequences of
more closely related organisms. Above we have described
this kind of evidence for LGT within the gdh gene families
– many relationships are at odds with accepted views of
organismal relationships in the phylogenetic reconstructions of GDH-1 and GDH-2 (Figs. 1 & 2). Among the
potential transfers with maximum likelihood bootstrap
support values above 50% (green and red ovals in Figs. 1
and 2), there are seven transfers suggested between different lineages of eubacteria and two transfers between
eubacteria and archaea (Figs. 1 & 2). Intriguingly, the phylogenetic reconstructions also indicate three cases of gene
transfers involving eukaryotes; a ciliate and a kinetoplastid probably acquired gdh1 genes from two different
eubacterial lineages (Fig. 1), and the large eukaryotic
group most likely exchanged a gdh2 gene with the α-proteobacterial lineage (Fig. 2). The strength of the support

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/3/14

for the putative transfers differs between the individual
cases and between the two phylogenetic methods. While
all three putative transfers involving eukaryotes show
strong support from both analyses and most likely represent true cases of LGT, two of the suggested intra-domain
eubacterial transfers and both the prokaryotic interdomain transfers show only weak support from the maximum likelihood distance analysis and therefore should be
viewed as more tentative cases (Figs. 1 & 2). All potential
transfers affecting eukaryotes seem to have involved
microbes – the two transfers of gdh1 genes involve protists
and the common ancestor of the large eukaryotic GDH-2
group was most likely unicellular. Unfortunately, the relative rates of transfers are extremely difficult to estimate
due to the limited number of events, poorly resolved phylogenies, a highly non-random taxon sampling and our
incomplete knowledge of organismal relationships within
the three domains of life. Nevertheless, the observed possible transfers suggest that the rate at which LGT occurs
within the gdh gene families in microbial eukaryotes is
comparable to the rate in prokaryotes.

Conclusions
This work clearly demonstrates that analyses of distribution patterns of genes should be complemented with phylogenetic reconstructions of the genes themselves in order
to distinguish between differential gene loss and gene
transfer [19]. The combination of phylogenetic reconstructions and analyses of phylogenetic distribution patterns of the four gdh gene families provide strong support
for numerous gene transfers involving prokaryotes, as well
as microbial eukaryotes. Differential gene loss, on the
other hand, does not seem to have played an important
role in the evolution of gdh genes in any of the three
domains of life. The rates at which lateral gene transfer
occurs in prokaryotes versus microbial eukaryotes may be
similar. We predict that systematic analyses, such as this,
of a much wider array of gene families will show that LGT
is an important evolutionary mechanism in genome evolution among protists.

Methods
PCR and sequencing of eukaryotic gdh genes
To extend the sampling of gdh genes from diverse eukaryotes we PCR amplified and sequenced gdh1 genes from
the diplomonads S. vortens (strain ATCC 50386) and H.
inflata (strain AZ-4) and the parabasalid Monocercomonas
sp. (strain NS-1PRR ATCC 50210). The degenerate primers GDH1f1 (GCTCTCGGNCCNTAYAARGG), GDH1f2
(CCGGAGGCNACNGGNTAYGG), GDH1r1 (TCGTTCTGNGTNGCRCANGG)
and
GDH1r2
(AACCCGGCDATRTTNGCNCC) designed against conserved
regions of the gdh1 gene were used with genomic DNA of
the three species in PCR reactions. Samples of genomic
DNAs were obtained as gifts: H. inflata was a gift from H.

van Keulen, S. vortens was a gift from P.J. Keeling and
Monocercomonas sp. was a gift from M. Müller. The resulting PCR products were purified using the Qiaquick PCR
Purification Kit (Qiagen) and directly sequenced using the
ABI PRISM BigDye Termination Cycle Sequencing Kit
(Applied Biosystems) using the primers used in the amplification as well as internal exact-match primers. cDNA
clones encoding GDH-1 were retrieved from EST projects
for the parabasalid T. vaginalis, the diplomonad S. barkhanus and the oomycete P. infestans [15]. cDNAs clones
encoding both GDH-1 and GDH-2 were retrieved from
the red alga P. yezoensis [16] and a cDNA clone encoding
GDH-2 was retrieved from the EST project for the green
alga C. reinhardtii [17]. These clones were completely
sequenced by primer walking.
Assembly of GDH datasets
GDH sequences were identified using BLAST searches
against a variety of databases with representatives from
the four different classes of the enzyme as 'probes' (queries). This work was performed in April 2002. All published homologs were retrieved from the National Center
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [20]. Unpublished
eukaryotic sequences were retrieved from NCBI using the
"other eukaryotes" BLAST service in their genomic BLAST
pages. In addition, the Dictyostelium discoideum Genome
Project database [21] and the "microbial genomes" BLAST
service at NCBI were searched for homologs. Two unpublished GDH-3 sequences were retrieved. Unpublished αproteobacterial and cyanobacterial sequences were
retrieved for GDH-1 and GDH-2, in order to explore the
possibility that the eukaryotic groups originated via endosymbiotic gene transfer from the mitochondria and chloroplast, respectively. All other unpublished prokaryotic
GDH-1, GDH-2 and GDH-4 sequences were excluded to
reduce the computational burden of the phylogenetic
reconstructions. After inclusion of the newly generated
GDH sequences and removal of sequences from different
strains of the same species, the sizes of the datasets were
66, 73, 12 and 15 taxa for GDH-1, GDH-2, GDH-3 and
GDH-4, respectively.

with strong amino acid compositional heterogeneity in
the data [24].
Protein maximum likelihood phylogenies were inferred
using PMBML [25], a modified version of the of PROML
within the PHYLIP package, version 3.6a2 [26]. The
rationale for using PMBML rather than PROML was that
the available version of PROML did not support the use of
a Jones-Taylor-Thornton (JTT) substitution model at the
time of analysis. A mixed four-category discrete-gamma
model of among-site rate variation plus invariable sites
(JTT + Γ + Inv) and 10 random additions (jumbles) with
global rearrangements were used to find the optimal trees.
The Γ shape parameters of the gamma distribution, α, the
resulting rate categories and the fraction of invariable
sites, Pinv, were estimated using TREE-PUZZLE, version
4.02 [23]. Protein maximum likelihood bootstrap values
were calculated by analysis of 500 resampled datasets
using the same parameters, except that only one round of
random addition (jumble) followed by global rearrangements were performed for each replicate. Protein maximum likelihood distance bootstrap values for bipartitions
were calculated by analysis of 500 resampled datasets
using PUZZLEBOOT [27] with a mixed eight-category discrete-gamma model of among-site rate variation plus
invariable sites (JTT + Γ + Inv).

Phylogenetic analyses
The amino acid sequences within each dataset were
aligned using CLUSTALW [22] and unambiguously
aligned regions were identified and removed by visual
inspection. Sequences with >85% amino acid sequence
identity within the unambiguously aligned regions were
excluded from the dataset to reduce the computational
time. The χ2 tests for deviation of amino acid frequencies
implemented in TREE-PUZZLE, version 4.02 [23], were
applied to the datasets and sequences that failed the test
were excluded from further phylogenetic analysis since
the currently available phylogenetic methods cannot deal
