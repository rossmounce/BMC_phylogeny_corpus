Abstract
Background: G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the most numerous proteins in
mammalian genomes, and the most common targets of clinical drugs. However, their evolution
remains enigmatic. GPCRs are intimately associated with trimeric G proteins, G protein receptor
kinases, and arrestins. We conducted phylogenetic studies to reconstruct the history of arrestins.
Those findings, in turn, led us to investigate the origin of the photosensory GPCR rhodopsin.
Results: We found that the arrestin clan is comprised of the Spo0M protein family in archaea and
bacteria, and the arrestin and Vps26 families in eukaryotes. The previously known animal arrestins
are members of the visual/beta subfamily, which branched from the founding "alpha" arrestins
relatively recently. Curiously, we identified both the oldest visual/beta arrestin and opsin genes in
Cnidaria (but not in sponges). The arrestin clan has 14 human members: 6 alphas, 4 visual/betas,
and 4 Vps26 genes. Others recently showed that the 3D structure of mammalian Vps26 and the
biochemical function of the yeast alpha arrestin PalF are similar to those of beta arrestins. We note
that only alpha arrestins have PY motifs (known to bind WW domains) in their C-terminal tails,
and only visual/betas have helix I in the Arrestin N domain.
Conclusion: We identified ciliary opsins in Cnidaria and propose this subfamily is ancestral to all
previously known animal opsins. That finding is consistent with Darwin's theory that eyes evolved
once, and lends some support to Parker's hypothesis that vision triggered the Cambrian explosion
of life forms. Our arrestin findings have implications on the evolution of GPCR signaling, and on the
biological roles of human alpha arrestins.

Background
G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are arguably the
most important proteins in human evolution and medicine [1]. The rhodopsin class of GPCRs alone is the most
highly represented protein family in mammals [2].
Humans have on the order of 799 [3] to 1,282 [4] GPCRs,
and they are the protein family most commonly targeted
by clinical drugs. GPCRs are transmembrane receptors
that mediate the majority of extracellular signaling in

mammals. They can sense diverse types of signals, including hormones, lipids, olfactants, tastants, ions, light, and
soluble and surface-anchored peptides. Despite the name,
not all GPCRs signal through G proteins. And many or
most GPCRs also signal through non-G protein-mediated
pathways. The hallmark of GPCRs is that they have seven
transmembrane helices. Thus, the terms seven transmembrane receptor (7TMR) and GPCR are used interchangeably by some.

It has been extremely challenging to determine the evolution of the 7TMR superfamily due to the large number of
7TMRs and the existence of highly divergent subfamilies.
However, this was initiated for fully sequenced genomes
from several bilateral animals, two fungi, two plants and
one alveolate [5]. Recently-sequenced genomes (e.g.,
from protists and basal metazoans) will soon begin to fill
in key gaps. Notably, it is widely believed that 7TMRs do
not represent a single superfamily [1,6]. That is based on
the perceived weakness, or lack of, protein sequence similarity between many 7TMRs – most importantly between
the major 7TMR families of archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. But others claimed that analysis with PSI-BLAST and
hidden Markov models suggest that bacterial, archaeal,
and eukaryotic/animal 7TMRs are distantly related [7].
This issue generates much attention (and confusion) with
regards to the evolution of vision [8-10]. Importantly,
protein sequence analysis strongly suggests that bacteriorhodopsins of archaea/bacteria and rhodopsins of animals are separate 7TMR subfamilies that arose
independently [6]. The 7TMR subfamily named after rhodopsin contains vast numbers of non-opsin genes, and
there is no indication that opsins are among the earliest
members. To our knowledge, the oldest known member
of the Rhodopsin subfamily is from yeast [5].
The three intimate associates of GPCRs are heterotrimeric
G proteins, G protein coupled receptor kinases (GRKs)
and arrestins. Study of those proteins could offer clues
about 7TMR evolution. Phylogenetic analysis of G alpha
subunits is possible due to the presence of a signature protein sequence. In the Pfam database, G alphas can be seen
in protists, plants and unikonts. GRKs have been reported
from mammals down to nematode worms and insects
[11]. However, their relationship to the large family of
protein kinases may complicate the determination of the
phylogeny of GRKs; we found no reported attempt to do
this.
The main focus of this work is reconstructing the arrestin
phylogeny. Arrestins regulate the inactivation [12-14],
internalization [15,16], trafficking [17,18] and signaling
[19,20] of transmembrane receptors of the 7TM and
kinase classes (Reviewed by [21]). They are defined by the
presence of two homologous protein sequences known as
Arrestin N and C domains. Arrestins selectively bind
receptors that are both in an activated conformation and
phosphorylated [22]. This is possible because they have
an autoinhibited resting state maintained by interacting
polar and solvent-excluded residues in abutting arrestin-N
and C domains [23,24]. Phosphates on activated receptors destabilize that "polar core" and allow binding of specific receptor residues at the fulcrum of, and on the
concave faces of, the two arrestin domains. A second feature maintaining the basal conformation is the "three-ele-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/222

ment interaction" of hydrophobic residues in beta strand
I, alpha helix I, and beta strand XX in the C-terminal tail
[25]. Release of this interaction in activated arrestin thus
frees the C-terminal tail, allowing it to bind clathrin and
its adaptor AP-2. Arrestin activities vary according to their
own modifications by phosphorylation and ubiquitination, their interactions with dozens of other proteins [26],
and the specifics of their interactions with receptors (e.g.,
low or high receptor-arrestin affinity can determine
whether receptors are recycled or degraded [17]).
Until recently, when fungal arrestins were discovered
[27,28], it was believed that arrestins emerged in animals.
Fruit flies and mosquitos each have two known visual
arrestins and two beta arrestins [29]. The worm C. elegans,
which lacks vision, has one known beta arrestin [30].
Humans are presumed to have four arrestins: two photoreceptor-specific visual arrestins and two nearly ubiquitous beta arrestins [26]. The first phylogenetic study of
visual and beta arrestins was recently reported [26]. However, it has not been determined how visual/beta arrestins
are related to similar proteins in fungi [27,28] and animals [31-33]. The official gene names of the mammalian
proteins are Arrestin Domain Containing 1–5 (Arrdc1–5)
and Txnip [nomenclature/aliases of vertebrate arrestins
are discussed in Additional file 1]. We refer to that subfamily as alpha arrestins – to distinguish them from their
close relatives, the visual/beta arrestins, and their more
distant relatives, Spo0M and Vps26 (all of which contain
arrestin domains, below). Here we report the evolutionary
history of the arrestin clan. Those findings made us consider whether visual/beta arrestin emerged in concert with
opsin. That, in turn, led us establish that opsins predated
Bilaterata (also see [34,35]). We discuss what our results
suggest about eye evolution and arrestin functions.

Results and discussion
Identification of novel members of the arrestin clan
We conducted phylogenetic analysis of arrestins and
found a large tree of mostly unrecognized arrestins in
eukaryotes (Figs. 1, 2) [see Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4]. Figure 1 is a phylogenetic tree of arrestins from select evolutionarily diverse genomes. It shows that all the known
animal arrestins [26] are members of a small branch of the
protein family that emerged relatively recently. We suggest
that the two subfamilies could be termed alpha and beta
(or visual/beta) class arrestins [discussed in Additional file
1]. This applies because the alphas are the ancient/ancestral arrestins and it fits well with the historical name of the
betas (named in reference to beta adrenergic receptors).

We find varied numbers of arrestins in the phyla previously known to have arrestins – fungi and animals. For
example, the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has three
arrestins. Nematode worms and flies each have approxi-

Arrestin2protein family: multiple sequence alignment of phylogenetically diverse members
Arrestin protein family: multiple sequence alignment of phylogenetically diverse members. The alpha and beta
classes of arrestins are distinct. Positions that may be widely conserved by common descent are yellow, beta/visual-specific are
red and alpha-specific are blue (ambiguous in gray). Black positions in the Tail are the PPXY (or (P/L)PXY or "PY") motifs.
PPXY motifs can have alternative residues in the first position. Notably, the sea urchin alpha arrestin has two PPXY and seven
QPXY motifs. The sea urchin and nematode alphas also share the PY-like sequence (Y/F)APXYP(Y/F)Y. The arrestin domains
are given below the alignment, n for N domain, c for C and t for Tail; italics show sequence not considered as part of the N and
C domains according to Pfam. Shading on that line maps secondary structure elements on cone arrestin (symbol ARR3, HUGO
nomenclature; aka arrestin 4, X-arrestin) – beta strands in gray and the one alpha helix in black [78]. Underlining highlights
regions involved in receptor specificity, as described in Ref. [78] and references within. Two sets of intra-molecular interactions are important for keeping visual/beta arrestins in their basal conformation (see text): number symbols (#) mark residues
that make up the "polar core"; asterisks (*) show residues involved in the "three-element interaction". Identifiers follow: fly a,

mately twenty. Half of the worm and fly arrestins appear
to have emerged in their respective lineages. Humans have
a total of 10 arrestins. For comparison, humans have
approximately the same number of 7TMRs as Caenorhabditis elegans and four times as many as Drosophila [4].
Even protists, which are single-celled, show diverse numbers of arrestins [see Additional file 3]. For example, Dictyostelium, which has approximately 55 7TMRs [36], has
four arrestin genes, and Tetrahymena has fifteen. It is

worth noting that Tetrahymena have much more complex
membrane and cytoskeletal architecture than animals.
Their genome has a striking expansion of genes involved
in membrane and cytoskeletal dynamics [37]. Moreover,
the percent of their genome devoted to kinases is double
that of fungi and animals, but they only have four annotated 7TMRs. This hints that early arrestin function could
have been associated with membrane/cytoskeletal
dynamics or kinase signaling.

Compared to visual and beta arrestins, alphas have conserved protein sequence and domain topology spanning
almost their full lengths. The high sequence conservation
suggests their molecular functions are similar. For example, human TXNIP matches Arrestin N and C domains
with Expect scores of 3.3e-46 and 9.8e-28, respectively
(using HMMER, see Methods). We also found two
domains that appear to be distantly related to arrestins,
Spo0M and Vps26 (Fig. 3). Both are clearly alpha arrestinlike, rather than beta. This finding was independently
made by investigators managing the Pfam database of
curated protein patterns and posted on their database
(Accession CL0135; J. Mistry, unpublished). They validate
this "Arrestin N-like clan" with one multiple sequence
alignment of most available members of the three protein
subfamilies, and provide confidence scores of 1e-9 (arrestin N-Spo0M) and 2e-8 (arrestin N-Vps26).
Spo0M proteins are present in archaea (at least in multiple
species of Halobacteriaceae) and in diverse bacterial phyla
(Cyanobacteria, Actinobacteria, Gamma/Beta-proteobacteria and Firmicutes), but not in eukaryotes. Notably,
archaea and bacteria have seven transmembrane proteins
(structurally related to eukaryotic 7TMRs) and serine/threonine/tyrosine-specific kinases, both of which were
widely believed to be eukaryotic inventions until recently
[7,38]. Little is known about Spo0M except that it is transcriptionally regulated by sigmaH and that it inhibits
sporulation. It is tempting to speculate that Spo0M has a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/222

role in transmembrane signaling that links environmental
status to sporulation.
The crystal structure of a mammalian Vps26 protein
revealed that it has two arrestin domains [39,40]. However, it was concluded there is no protein sequence similarity, presumably because Vps26 was compared to the
visual/beta arrestins (and not to the much more closely
related alpha arrestins) [40]. It was also suggested that the
structural similarities between the two subfamilies are
mostly superficial [39]. The claim is that Vps26 lacks all of
the specific functional features of visual/beta arrestins:
mainly, the sites responsible for GPCR, clathrin/AP2, and
phosphatidylinositol phospholipid binding. Two groups
disagree on the possibility that the two proteins could
have similar switch mechanisms based on conformational rearrangements [39,40]. While both proteins have
polar and electrostatic interactions between the N and C
domains, they are mediated by different residues on different secondary structural elements. A caveat is that this
analysis is limited by the absence of structural and functional information about alpha arrestins. That is, Vps26 is
being compared to distantly related visual/beta arrestins,
rather than the much more closely related alpha arrestins.
Our results, and those of Pfam, indicate Vps26 and arrestin are true homologs. Alpha arrestins have robustly similar structure predictions to those solved for beta class
arrestins and Vps26 [23,40,41] [see Additional files 1, 4].
For example, "threading" of alpha arrestin TXNIP through
all known crystal structures matches rod visual arrestin

and Vps26 with an identical probability value of 1e-10
(using GenThreader [see Additional file 2].
The Vps26 domain appears to be present in all eukaryotes
(see Pfam PF07070). Its presence in plants is significant
because they lack arrestin. Similar to arrestins, Vps26 proteins very rarely have associated domains. In addition to
the two known human Vps26 genes – VPS26 and VPS26B
– we found two new ones: DSCR3 and an un-annotated
gene on 2q33.3 (Methods). Vps26p was discovered in a
genetic yeast screen for "vacuole protein sorting, Vps"
[42]. The yeast vacuole is the equivalent of the mammalian lysosome. Vps26 forms part of the retromer complex
that mediates protein transport from endosomes to the
trans-Golgi [43]. It is also involved in receptor transcytosis
in polarized cells as well as in Wnt signaling and gradient
formation [44]. The retromer has two subcomplexes, one
responsible for cargo-selection and the other for vesicle
formation. Vps26, Vps35 and Vps29 form the receptor
cargo-binding subcomplex. Vps26 also has an adaptor
role linking that subcomplex to the membrane-binding
subcomplex. However, the exact biochemical role of
Vps26 is not defined. While there are four Vps26 genes in
mammals, the other retromer components are represented by single genes.
Retromer function is thus reminiscent of the role of beta
arrestins in receptor endocytosis. Both arrestin and Vps26
are part of a transmembrane receptor-binding complex on
the cytoplasmic face of endosomes. Arrestin further interacts with the membrane via the clathrin adaptor AP-2, and
Vps26p does so through Vps5p/Vps17p (referred to as
sorting nexins 1/2 in mammals). Both arrestin and Vps26
form complexes that co-localize with key vesicular trafficking proteins such as Rab5 and N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF). NSF interacts directly with beta arrestin
[45] and is required for retromer endosome-to-golgi trafficking [46]. It is curious that beta arrestins bind the Vps26
partner Vps35 [47], and that Vps35 is present in 7TMR
complexes [48]; however, there is no evidence those interactions are biologically relevant.
Alpha arrestins were present in early eukaryotes
We used PSI-BLAST to search for all arrestins in the GenBank protein database (Methods). We found alpha
arrestins in fungi and in all multi-cellular life except plants.
Mammals have six alpha and four visual/beta arrestins
[see Additional files 1, 4]. The significant proteinsequence difference between some of those alpha
arrestins suggests they have more diverse functions than
the more closely related visual/betas. The single arrestin
present in viruses is a vertebrate alpha arrestin, Arrdc3,
that was horizontally transferred to canarypox virus
[Additional files 1, 5]. We also identified arrestins in all
protist groups except Rhizaria, which has little sequence

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/222

available. In Additional file 3 we describe the protist proteins. Since Arrestin N and C domains are related by protein sequence, we searched for single-domain proteins
that could be the ancestral arrestin domain that was duplicated. We found that no arrestin-containing kingdom or
species has exclusively single-domain proteins. This result
is consistent with the finding that the VPS26 crystal structure reveals tandem domains [40]. We believe a twin
domain gene was duplicated in a bacterium or basal
eukaryote and gave rise to genomes with both arrestin
(which was subsequently lost in plants) and Vps26.
We searched for arrestin-associated domains that could
hint at biochemical functions. Outside of the protists, we
found that these are extremely rare. We found exactly two
domains that recurred in at least two divergent phyla; they
were in two distantly related orders of the fungus-like protists Amoebozoa [see Additional file 3]. Two Dictyostelium
and two Entamoebidae arrestins each contain a C2 domain,
which is a Ca2+-dependent phospholipid/membrane
binding element. In one order the C2 domains are N-terminal in both proteins, in the other both are C-terminal.
This suggests they could have been created by independent events of exon shuffling in the two orders. Two other
genes, one from each of the same two orders, contain one
FYVE domain in their C-terminal region. FYVE domains
have exquisite specificity for phosphatidylinositol-3phosphate (PtdIns(3)P), an endosomal marker recognized by proteins involved in signaling and trafficking.
Notably, Vps26 interacts with the PtdIns(3)P-binding
protein sorting nexin 1 [49]. The presence of associated
C2 and FYVE domains indicates some ancient arrestin
functions involve plasma and endosomal membrane
interactions, respectively. This is consistent with known
arrestin roles in transmembrane receptor-binding and
endocytic trafficking.
Difference between alpha and visual/beta arrestins
Figure 2 and Additional file 4 show multiple sequence
alignments comparing diverse known and new arrestins.
While many positions are conserved in all arrestins, it is
clear that there are two classes of arrestins – the visual/
beta class and the more ancient alpha class. The protein
analysis is discussed in Additional file 1. The most salient
features of this comparison are 1) alpha arrestins lack the
arrestin N domain helix [see Additional files 4, 6], and 2)
alphas, but not visual/betas, have PPXY (or (P/L)PXY,
"PY") motifs (Fig. 2, Additional file 4).

Helix I of visual/beta arrestins is sequestered in the inactive conformation and is presumably released upon activation [41]. This helix has hydrophobic residues on one
face and basic residues on the other. However, it is a mystery what it does, or interacts with, in the active conformation. Helix I leucine substitutions suggested a role in

Page 6 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:222

receptor binding [25], and it was later theorized to be a
membrane-docking element that permits non-specific
interactions with activated receptors [41]. Other experiments showed that helix I is important for the formation
of dense-core vesicles [50]. The proposed membrane
docking role of helix I remains attractive to us. We add
that such an insertion would displace membrane on the
cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane. This could
induce positive curvature and promote endocytocis. Notably, helix I is absent in alpha arrestins (Fig. 2, Additional
files 4, 6) and is thus a major innovation in beta arrestins.
That interpretation is supported by the absence of helix I
in the 3D structure of VPS26 [40], which has protein
sequence similarity to alpha arrestins.
All indications suggest apha and beta arrestins have similar structural topologies, but do alphas also bind 7TMRs?
Nichols and Sanders-Bush announced their discovery of a
new mammalian arrestin (now alpha) in 2004 [31]. However, to our knowledge there are no published studies of
arrestin-like functions in animal alpha arrestins. The current understanding of alpha arrestin biochemistry thus
comes from fungi and yeast. Herranz, Vincent and colleagues showed that fungal PalF (Aspergillus nidulans) is a
bona fide arrestin by protein sequence and function [28].
PalF binds C-terminal sites of the activated seven transmembrane pH sensing receptor PalH. Moreover, alkaline
activation induces PalH-dependent phosphorylation and
ubiquitination of PalF. Truncation of the PalH cytoplasmic domain disrupts PalF-binding and inhibits growth in
alkaline pH. The alpha arrestin PalF thus resembles beta
arrestins in its ability to bind active receptors, generate a
signal and be posttranslationally modified in the process.
The function of PalF, however, is in signal transduction
and apparently not in inhibition of G protein signaling.
pH sensing and "vacuole protein sorting, Vps" pathways
are intimately associated in fungi. Herranz et al. thus propose that the role of PalF is likely to relate to endocytic
trafficking. This is notable considering that Vps26, an
ancient arrestin relative, was discovered in a genetic screen
for Vps genes.
While beta arrestin tail domains have conserved clathrininteracting motifs, alphas have PY motifs. Is there evidence
the latter are functional? PY motifs bind WW domains and
their interactions are extensively defined by diverse biochemical and structural methods [51]. The strong conservation of multiple PY motifs in fungal and animal
arrestins suggests they interact with WW proteins. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has three alpha arrestins, all of which
have turned up in biochemical and genetic screens [see
Additional file 1]. Without knowing they were studying
arrestins, others showed that two S. cerevisiae arrestins
(Rod1p and Rog3p) bind the HECT (or Nedd4 family) E3
ubiquitin ligase Rsp5p [52,53]. Moreover, they showed by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/222

mutagenesis that the interactions are mediated by two PY
motifs in arrestin and two WW domains in Rsp5p [52].
Our computational analysis of the human genome identified 25 WW proteins that may interact with alpha arrestins
(not shown). Notably nine of those genes are candidate
co-orthologs of yeast Rsp5p. This suggests alpha arrestins
could be involved in ligand-dependent 7TMR ubiquitination and trafficking [18,54], which, in some yeast and
mammalian cases, are mediated by HECT E3 ligases
[55,56]. We also suspect arrestin PY motifs interact with
other WW proteins that are involved in cytoskeletal
dynamics, endocytocis/trafficking and signaling. Using
yeast two hybrid methodology, we have found that alpha
arrestin tails robustly bind the WW domains of HECT E3
ligases and of other proteins (F.-C. Hsieh, W.-K. Chen and
C. A., unpublished).
Origins of visual/beta arrestin and rhodopsin
The fact that all known visual arrestins cluster together
with beta arrestins suggested to us that this branch may
have emerged together with an early opsin. We used visual/beta arrestin and visual/beta arrestin consensus
sequences to search GenBank for the earliest family member we could find (Methods). The oldest visual/beta arrestin we found is from Hydra (Cnidaria; Figs. 1, 2). Notably,
Cnidarians are the only beta arrestin-containing organisms that predate any known opsin. We next searched for
the oldest opsin genes present in all, but the Trace database of GenBank (Methods). That analysis resulted in the
identification of multiple Hydra ESTs encoding partial
opsin proteins (data not shown). Of the known subfamilies, we only found representation of ciliary opsin.
We were able to assemble the full length open reading
frame for one of these (Fig. 4; Methods). This Cnidarian
protein is strikingly similar to ciliary opsins, placing it in
the same group as rag-worm ciliary opsin (non-visual
[57]) and human visual opsins on the phylogenetic tree of
opsins [10].

Cnidarian opsin genes are the first to be reported that predate the emergence of Bilaterata [57]. While the present
study was under review, others independently reported
finding Cnidarian opsins [34,35]. As we did, both of those
groups found that Cnidarians have ciliary opsins. They
additionally reported other highly divergent opsins that
cannot be clearly classified according to the known subfamilies. Remarkably, Suga, Schmid and Gehring identified large numbers of opsin genes in single species of
Cnidarians: 30 sea anemone, 63 hydra, and 18 jellyfish
[35]. They showed jellyfish opsins are expressed in multiple patterns, including in the eyes and gonads (similar to
a previous finding in fruit fly testes [58]). Neither those
studies nor ours (data not shown) were able to find any
evidence of opsins in sponges or older phyla. This is con-

Novel Hydra opsin aligned with rag-worm ciliary opsin
Figure 4
Novel Hydra opsin aligned with rag-worm ciliary opsin. As expected, the sequence conservation is highest in the seven
transmembrane regions (underlined). The signature residue perfectly conserved in all opsins is the lysine that retinal forms a
Schiff base with. This conserved position is shown in red. The position of the well-characterized glutamate counterion of some
ciliary opsins, is instead a tyrosine in several ciliary opsins and all rhabdomeric opsins. Hydra ciliary opsin has a serine at that
position. The cytoplasmic regions shown by mutagenesis to be critical for G protein interaction are underlined by gray boxes.
The first of those cytoplasmic regions contains the highly conserved DRY element, which contains an arginine critical for G
protein activation. That sequence is more similar in Hydra (YRY) than in rag-worm (VRC), shown by gray highlighting.

sistent with the fact that sponges use flavin or carotenoid
photopigments [59].
The early evolution of vision is an open question [9]. It
was long known that some jellyfish have image forming
eyes, but the molecular identity of their visual pigments
was a mystery until now. Recently it was postulated that
the absence of a master transcriptional regulator, Pax6, in
the box jellyfish is consistent with the independent evolution of eyes in higher metazoans [60]. Gehring [9] offered
two alternative explanations to that same question: vertical evolution from a photosensitive protist and horizontal
evolution through a photosynthetic cyanobacterial symbiont. We proposed that the phylogeny of the phototransduction machinery would explain the evolution of
phototransduction and vision [61]. The new opsin phylogeny suggests to us that ciliary opsins are likely to be
ancestral to all previously known [10] visual pigments in
animals. That possibility is consistent with Darwin's theory that eyes evolved once [8]:
How a nerve comes to be sensitive to light hardly concerns us
more than how life itself originated; but I may remark that, as
some of the lowest organisms in which nerves cannot be
detected are capable of perceiving light, it does not seem impossible that certain sensitive elements in their sarcode should
become aggregated and developed into nerves endowed with
this special sensibility...

The simplest organ which can be called an eye consists of an
optic nerve surrounded by pigment-cells and covered by translucent skin, but without any lens or other refractive body. We
may, however, according to M. Jourdain, descend even a step
lower, and find aggregates of pigment-cells, apparently serving
as organs of vision, without any nerves, and resting merely on
sarcodic tissue. Eyes of the above simple nature are not capable
of distinct vision, and serve only to distinguish light from darkness.
The fact that both opsin and visual/beta arrestin are
present in Cnidaria, but not older phyla, hints that the
two subfamilies could have emerged in concert. Early
phototransduction offered major advantages, such as
photoperiodicity and phototaxis. Presumably, the first
step was the creation of photosensory opsin. However,
there must have been immense avenues for improvement
after that point. One challenge to early opsin was exposure to light intensity that varies by 10 orders of magnitude, the earth's daily illumination cycle. The innovation
in visual/beta arrestin could have improved the modulation of signaling gain by regulating opsin localization,
endocytosis/recycling or inactivation kinetics. Gene duplication is a hugely important mechanism for evolution
[62]. Visual phototransduction consistently uses dedicated proteins created by gene duplication (best characterized in flies and mammals [63,64]). For example, in
addition to opsin 7TMRs, mammalian photoreceptor cells
have their own, or nearly exclusive, G proteins, cGMPphosphodiesterases, G protein-coupled receptor kinases,

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:222

arrestins, etc. Outside the eye, a handful of each of those
proteins transduces signals for the remaining hundreds of
7TMRs. This extreme specialization illustrates the high
importance of vision in animal evolution.
Possible implication of pre-Cambrian vision
Both opsin and visual/beta arrestin are present in Cnidaria, but not in sponges, the most basal metazoans (nor
in any older model organism). This is interesting in light
of Parker's recent proposal that vision set off the Cambrian explosion of life forms [65]. 543 million years ago
(MYA) only three phyla existed, but, in the following 5
MY, 35 phyla emerged. No new phyla have emerged since
that Cambrian explosion. [This is widely accepted, but some
have argued it may be an artifact of the fossil record [66].]
Parker proposed that vision triggered the Cambrian explosion by creating a new world of organismal interactions
[65]. The key observation is that pre-Cambrian phyla were
soft-bodied. However, the Cambrian saw an apparently
limitless diversification of hard body parts. At the same
time, the use of biological color appeared. Parker claims
this scenario can be explained by the emergence of vision,
which must have resulted in new behaviors such as predation. Seeing-predators would have suddenly needed rigid
components to pursue, attack, and eat their prey (e.g., in
limbs, jaws, and sharp mouth parts). Their prey – which
may or may not have had eyes – also had to adapt by
developing hard shells or spines, camouflage or even
invisibility (as is seen in jellyfish).

Parker specifically hypothesized that this "Light Switch"
was triggered by the emergence of arthropod eyes during
the Cambrian. Put another way, he proposed the Light
Switch required image perception and brain processing of
the information (i.e., this was The trigger, and precursors
of such vision did not provide a major evolutionary stimulus). We find his general argument to be compelling.
However, we believe the spark had to precede the Cambrian explosion. We propose that light perception in a
pre-Cambrian animal initiated new dimensions of organismal and environmental interactions. This may have progressed steadily until a critical mass of interactions was
reached, the Cambrian explosion. Our findings (and also
[34,35]) are clear evidence that opsin (and beta arrestin)
predated the Cambrian period. This meets what we consider to be the first requirement for a visual trigger hypothesis. If sight initiated an arms race in the biosphere, it is
not surprising that some organisms refined it and others
lost it (e.g., some predators and prey, respectively). Only
six of 38 phyla on earth have eyes, but these six seeing
phyla account for >95% of all living animals. It is not difficult to imagine that the relative success of seeing animals
is due to the extraordinary advantage of vision.

Conclusion
Despite the high interest in GPCR signaling, its evolution
remains enigmatic. There is some evidence that archaeal
and bacterial 7TMRs are homologous to eukaryotic 7TM/
GPCRs [7]. However, heterotrimeric G proteins/G alpha
subunits are only present in eukaryotes. This suggests that
ancestral 7TM/GPCRs signaled by mechanisms other than
G protein coupling. We found that the arrestin clan is
present in archaea and bacteria, raising the possibility that
Spo0M could be a primordial 7TMR signaling partner. In
addition, our findings of Cnidarian opsins lead us to propose that the ciliary subfamily is ancestral to all bilaterian
opsins (also see [34,35]). That is consistent with Darwin's
theory that eyes evolved once.
There were two major arrestin-like gene families in early
eukaryotes, arrestin and Vps26. Both protein families are
well characterized and point to endocytosis/endosomal
dynamics as the ancestral arrestin/Vps26 functions. The
duplication of the arrestin domain was a critical event in
the creation of ancestral arrestin/Vps26. This could have
created autoinhibitory mechanisms (such as those seen in
beta arrestins), a recurrent theme in the evolution of signal transduction. The functional similarities of beta
arrestins and Vps26 proteins lead us to speculate that the
original arrestin/Vps26 was involved in receptor internalization. This could have had two classes of receptor effects
in concert: 1) desensitization and recycling/degradation,
and 2) signaling. Others have hypothesized that the original role of arrestins may have been as signaling adaptors
rather than terminators [67]. Above we mention biochemical evidence that mammalian Vps26 and arrestins
could have overlapping roles [47,48].
The homology of alpha and beta arrestins suggests their
molecular functions may be similar. There is evidence
from fungi that the alpha arrestin PalF specifically binds
an activated 7TMR [28]. That interaction has a positive
signaling role that is not yet identified. There are also differences between the alpha and beta classes. Beta arrestins
are generally cytoplasmic in unstimulated cells, while
alpha arrestins are often associated with membranes
[32,68]. Only visual/betas have helix I in the N domain.
And the tails of betas contain clathrin-interacting motifs,
while those of alphas have PY motifs. Studies in yeast
showed that alpha arrestin PY motifs interact with the
WW domains of the HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase Rsp5p. We
believe that a major role of alphas is to recruit WW proteins to activated receptors. Alpha and beta arrestins are
widely co-expressed. The fact that visual/beta arrestins can
hetero-associate [69], hints that alphas and betas may
also. Given the near ubiquitious involvement of beta
arrestins in 7TMR signaling, we speculate that alphas and
betas may function coordinately.

Methods
Identification of alpha arrestins
In the course of conducting BLAST analysis [70] of GenBank for TXNIP-related proteins, we found it is a member
of the arrestin protein family. We termed the new arrestin
class the alpha arrestins. We confirmed our findings using
the Pfam Hidden Markov Modeling HMMER server (Refs.
[71,72]) to test for similarities to the their database of
curated protein patterns [73]. TXNIP matches two
domains with apparent statistical certainty: Arrestin N
(Expect score, 3.3e-46) and Arrestin C (9.8e-28). Thus the
similarity of alpha and beta arrestins is strong and can be
detected by comparison of individual members (e.g.,
using BLAST) or by comparison to consensus sequences
(Conserved Domain-Search, NCBI; [74]) and protein
family alignment matrices (HMMER).
Identification of Spo0M and Vps26 as arrestin clan
members
Both these domains can be identified using domain
searching programs such as HMMER and Conserved
Domain-Search (NCBI; [74]) with a subset of arrestins.
The resulting Vps26 and Spo0M hits match only the arrestin N and C domain regions of arrestins. We also tested
the families with Position-Specific Iterated (PSI) BLAST
(NCBI; [75]), which uses multiple search iterations to
"learn" a pattern from related sequences (building a score
matrix after each round). PSI-BLAST analysis of all GenBank proteins with single members of the two families
exclusively yields the known family members on the first
"iteration" (the initial search). The second iteration of the
Vps26 search yielded several insect, nematode and vertebrate arrestins above the program's confidence threshold
(the best Expect score being for C. elegans F58G1.6, 3e04). The third iteration of the Spo0M search also identified insect, nematode and vertebrate arrestins (the best
score being C. elegans F48F7.7, 1e-09). In addition to the
two known human Vps26 genes – VPS26 and VPS26B –
we found two new ones: Down syndrome critical region
protein 3 (DSCR3) and what appears to be another
intron-containing active gene on 2q33.3 (including
207,259,576-207,260,296 on the UCSC Mar. 2006
assembly).
Hydra beta arrestin and opsin discovery
We used beta arrestin, beta arrestin consensus sequences,
and diverse opsin proteins to BLAST GenBank protein and
DNA databases (translated in all frames). The only prebilaterian beta arrestin and opsin were found in the Hydra
EST DNA database. The opsin was found by querying with
rag-worm ciliary opsin, which was the most ancient
known opsin [57]. Many Hydra beta arrestin and c-opsin
ESTs were identified and the coding cDNA sequence was
unambiguously assembled from several highly overlapping ESTs. The EST assemblies with accession numbers

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/222

and the translated protein sequence are given in Additional file 2. Curiously, Santillo and coworkers recently
cited a Hydra Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) annotated as
being similar to mouse peropsin [76]. We now find that
EST (which was only mentioned by accession number,
but not described as DNA or amino acid sequence) is one
of those we used to assemble the Hydra opsin cDNA. [That
EST, CB073527, is dated from 2003 in GenBank and
attributed to H. Bode et al., Washington University Hydra
EST Project.]
Phylogenetic tree building
Protein sequences were aligned using Clustal W. Manual
corrections were made and gaps were trimmed. A neighbor-joining tree was made from amino acid pairwise distance with Poisson correction (MEGA2, [77]). The
bootstrap value of the beta class branch was calculated
from 1000 repetitions. A similar score is seen for the Maximum Parsimony tree. Organism abbreviations followed

Multiple sequence alignment of human and zebrafish arrestins. A PDF
file showing a multiple sequence alignment of the human arrestin family
and select fish arrestins. It shows protein conservation and divergence of
different vertebrate arrestins. Alignment region of beta arrestin helix I
suggests this structural element is absent in alpha arrestins. The conservation of PY motifs in alpha arrestins suggests they are functional.

Phylogeny of canarypox virus alpha arrestin. A PDF file showing the
phylogeny of canarypox virus (CNPV) alpha arrestin. This analysis shows
CNPV arrestin is a highly divergent vertebrate Arrdc3 that was acquired
by horizontal gene transfer.
