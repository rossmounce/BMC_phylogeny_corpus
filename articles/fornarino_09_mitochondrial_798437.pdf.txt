Abstract
Background: Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent represent an area considered as a source and a reservoir for
human genetic diversity, with many markers taking root here, most of which are the ancestral state of eastern and
western haplogroups, while others are local. Between these two regions, Terai (Nepal) is a pivotal passageway allowing,
in different times, multiple population interactions, although because of its highly malarial environment, it was scarcely
inhabited until a few decades ago, when malaria was eradicated. One of the oldest and the largest indigenous people of
Terai is represented by the malaria resistant Tharus, whose gene pool could still retain traces of ancient complex
interactions. Until now, however, investigations on their genetic structure have been scarce mainly identifying East Asian
signatures.
Results: High-resolution analyses of mitochondrial-DNA (including 34 complete sequences) and Y-chromosome (67
SNPs and 12 STRs) variations carried out in 173 Tharus (two groups from Central and one from Eastern Terai), and 104
Indians (Hindus from Terai and New Delhi and tribals from Andhra Pradesh) allowed the identification of three principal
components: East Asian, West Eurasian and Indian, the last including both local and inter-regional sub-components, at
least for the Y chromosome.
Conclusion: Although remarkable quantitative and qualitative differences appear among the various population groups
and also between sexes within the same group, many mitochondrial-DNA and Y-chromosome lineages are shared or
derived from ancient Indian haplogroups, thus revealing a deep shared ancestry between Tharus and Indians. Interestingly,
the local Y-chromosome Indian component observed in the Andhra-Pradesh tribals is present in all Tharu groups,
whereas the inter-regional component strongly prevails in the two Hindu samples and other Nepalese populations.
The complete sequencing of mtDNAs from unresolved haplogroups also provided informative markers that greatly
improved the mtDNA phylogeny and allowed the identification of ancient relationships between Tharus and Malaysia,
the Andaman Islands and Japan as well as between India and North and East Africa. Overall, this study gives a paradigmatic
example of the importance of genetic isolates in revealing variants not easily detectable in the general population.

Background
Terai, a highly malarial region of South Nepal bordering
on India (Figure 1), was until a few decades ago, when
malaria was eradicated, inhabited almost exclusively by
Tharus, one of the oldest and the largest indigenous people of Terai. This group is known for their resistance to
malaria as evidenced by their decreased malarial morbidity compared to sympatric Nepalese populations [1], a
phenomenon not completely clarified at the genetic level.
It was only after substantially full malaria eradication,
through a program for malaria control started in 1956,
that several other Nepalese populations migrated and settled in Terai. Tharus live throughout the length of the
country (mainly in the northern strip of Terai) in villages
very close to, or even inside, the previously malarial forested zones. Although culturally and linguistically very
heterogeneous, they consider themselves as a unique
tribal entity subdivided into three main groups (western,
central and eastern).
Because of its geographic position in a boundary area of
Central Asia, Terai was a preferential passageway during
the dispersal of many prehistoric and historic populations, thus Tharus might have retained genetic traces of
ancient migratory events. Until 1980, however, their
genetic structure was almost unknown and, on the basis
of some classical serum markers [2] and physical features
[3], they were considered a 'Mongoloid' tribe. Subsequent
studies, carried out on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)
RFLPs, however, provided further support for the presence
of a Tharu East Asian component [4-8] and showed other
genetic characteristics of unclear origin [9]. In addition,
heterogeneity among the three groups was also evidenced

[5,9] by the different distribution of the malarial related
α-thal gene [10].
Even in more recent phylogeographic studies encompassing a large number of populations and including Tharu
samples, mostly from Uttar Pradesh [11-16], the Tharu
genetic structure was not completely clarified.
The present availability of more advanced techniques,
which allow molecular analyses at a much higher level of
resolution with extremely small amounts of DNA,
prompted us to once again address the issue of the genetic
origin of the Tharus, by analyzing both their mtDNA
(including sequencing of entire mtDNAs) and Y-chromosome (SNPs and STRs) variation.

Methods
The sample
The sample consisted of 173 Tharu DNAs from male
blood specimens collected more than 25 years ago, soon
after the massive immigrations of other populations into
Terai following malaria eradication, and 104 Indians. The
Tharu sample was composed of three groups from different villages: two in the Chitwan district of Central Terai
(Th-CI and Th-CII) and one in the Morang district of Eastern Terai (Th-E) (Figure 1). The Indian sample also was
composed of three groups: Hindus from Terai (H-Te, collected in the Chitwan district), Hindus from New Delhi
(H-ND) and tribals from Andhra Pradesh (T-AP). Absence
of close relationships between the individuals was ascertained through interview data. When necessary, genomic
amplification of DNA was performed by using the Amersham GenomiPhi kit.

This research has been approved by the Ethic Committee
for Clinical Experimentation of the University of Pavia,
after having verified the conformity to the international
rules.
MtDNA analyses
Affiliation within mtDNA haplogroups was first inferred
through the sequencing of a region ranging from 630–876
base pairs (bps) from the control region that, according to
the rCRS [17], encompasses the entire hypervariable segment I (HVS-I) and part of HVS-II, then confirmed
through a hierarchical survey by PCR-RFLP/DHPLC/
sequencing of haplogroup diagnostic markers in the coding regions [see Additional file 1]. The 9-bp deletion/
insertion polymorphism, already studied in a subset of
these populations [6], was also evaluated in all samples.

MtDNAs not ascribable to any known or well-defined
haplogroup/subhaplogroup were completely sequenced
according to Torroni et al. [18]. Overall, 34 novel complete sequences were produced in the course of this study.
The assignment of sequences to specific haplogroups was
performed as reported in Figure 2, according to the mostrecent classifications of Eurasian haplogroups and subhaplogroups [16,19-31].
Phylogenetic trees were constructed manually and validated by the Network 4.500 program software. Coalescence times for mtDNA haplogroups were calculated by
the rho (ρ) statistic according to the mutation-rate estimation of Mishmar et al. [32].
Y-chromosome analyses
Y-chromosome haplogroups were defined by the hierarchical order analysis of the 67 MSY bi-allelic markers
reported in Figure 3. The YAP, 12f2.1, LLY22g, PK3, PK4,
P47 and M429 polymorphisms were analyzed according
to Hammer and Horai [33], Rosser et al. [34], Zerjal et al.
[35], Mohyuddin et al. [36], Gayden et al. [37] and Underhill et al. [38]. All other mutations were detected by PCR/
DHPLC, according to Underhill et al. [39] and, when necessary, results were verified by sequencing fragments of
interest.

Twelve STR loci (DYS19, YCAIIa/b, DYS388, DYS389I/II,
DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, DYS393, DYS439 and
DYS460) were also analysed in the majority of the samples using two multiplex reactions according to http://
www.cstl.nist.gov/biotech/strbase/y20prim.htm information and by using ABI PRISM® 377 DNA Sequencer, internal size standard and GeneScan fragment analysis
software.
The age of microsatellite variation within haplogroups
was evaluated in samples of five or more subjects according to Sengupta et al. [15] using the mutation rate of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/154

0.00069 per locus per 25 years [40]. Haplogroup heterogeneity (H) was computed using Nei's standard method
[41]. Principal Component (PC) analysis was performed
on the mtDNA and Y-chromosome haplogroup frequencies using Excel software implemented by Xlstat.

Results
mtDNA
The mtDNA haplogroups of the examined populations,
together with their frequencies, are illustrated in the phylogeny of Figure 2. All M* mtDNAs were sequenced, and
only five (1–5 in Figures 4 and 5) did not cluster with
other complete sequences. These are reported together as
"M others" in Figure 2. The control-region motifs are
given in Additional file 1.

Super-haplogroups M (55.7%) and, to a lesser extent, R
(39.3%) are the most represented in the dataset. The M
lineages were predominant (>50%) in all populations
with highest values in the Tharu and Andhra Pradesh samples (75–88% and 76%, respectively). By contrast, the R
lineages were present at higher frequencies among Hindus
(43.7%) than among the Tharu and the Andhra Pradesh
tribals (19.1% and 24.1%) with a few overlaps in the haplogroup distribution. The N(xR) lineages were observed
only in three Hindus (4.9%).
The 9-bp polymorphism was found exclusively in the Tharus, associated with three different haplogroups: the deletion (6.4%) with haplogroups B5a (eight subjects) and
M33 (three subjects), and the insertion (one subject –
0.6%) with haplogroup M38 (Figures 2 &4).
Based on their known or supposed origin [11,20,42-45] it
is possible to identify among these haplogroups three
main components – East Asian, West Eurasian and Indian
– that show a very skewed distribution (Figure 6a).
The East Asian component
This is represented by nine M mtDNAs belonging to Hgs
C, D, G, M9, M21 and Z, and four R mtDNAs belonging
to Hgs B5a, and F1. This component, which amounts to
about 65% in the two groups of Central Tharus and 33%

Phylogeny and frequencies (%) of Y-chromosome haplogroups in the populations studied
Phylogeny and frequencies (%) of Y-chromosome haplogroups in the populations studied. Haplogroups: East Asian
in grey; West Eurasian in white; Indian in black. The nomenclature and the hierarchical order of the mutations are according to
the Y-Chromosome Consortium [62,67,73], updated with more recent markers: M429 [38]; M481 and P31 T-del (present
study). The nomenclature of haplogroup H differs from that presented by Karafet et al. [73], in that all of our M82 samples
were also M370 positive. H: intra-population haplogroup diversity, according to Nei [41]. In italics: markers not found. In
parentheses: markers inferred. Haplogroups with an asterix* include samples negative for the examined sub-groups.
in the Eastern Tharus, was not observed in the tribals of
Andhra Pradesh, and was seen only in two Hindus, one
(from Terai) as D4* and the other (from New Delhi) as
G*. These two haplogroups, together with the M9a, are
among the most frequent in the Tharus, especially group
G that includes the G* and G2a, and accounts for 20.8%
of the total sample, and for 26.3% of the Th-CI. Interestingly, on the basis of the sequence information of the
mtDNA control region (16223, 16274, 16362), the
Indian G* appears different from all the other G* haplogroups examined [see Additional file 1], and could belong
to haplogroup G3 [29,46]. Haplogroup M21, previously
described in Malaysia where it is present with different
sub-clades [24,47] has been observed in two Central Tharus, thus establishing a deep correlation with the people
of that area. Haplogroup B5a is present in all Tharus, with
the highest frequency (8.8%) in the Th-CI group. All these
share the 9-bp deletion and the HVS-I motif 1614016189-16266A, which corresponds to the Nicobar Island
B5a1 [25] and is closely related to the Chinese B5a
[48,49]. Haplogroup F1 is also present among Tharus as
F1*, F1c and F1d. In particular, the subhaplogroup F1c,

whose high frequency was reported in Tibeto-Burman
tribes of Thailand [50], China [51] and India [52], is
found in all Tharu groups.
The West Eurasian component
This component comprises the N haplogroups I and W,
and the R haplogroups R0, H, T2 and U (xU2a,b,c) and is
almost absent in the Tharus (only one H and one T2 mtDNAs from Chitwan). In contrast, it reaches a high frequency (25.0%) in New Delhi, where most of the
haplogroups of this component are found, and is also
common in Indians from Terai (12.5%) and Andhra
Pradesh (10.3%). However, in spite of the similar frequencies, the two latter populations are remarkably different in their composition: Hgs I, U1 and T2 characterize
the Terai Hindus, whereas Hgs U2e, U5a1 and U9a the
Andhra Pradesh tribals.

Among the West Eurasian U sub-clades, particularly interesting are U7 and U9. In the New Delhi sample, U7 shows
a frequency (10.4%) that is quite similar to that of Iran
(9.4%) and close to its peak (12.3%) in the West Indian

Phylogenetic tree of 51 mtDNA sequences
Phylogenetic tree of 51 mtDNA sequences. Mutations are scored relative to the rCRS [17]For the tree construction, the
length variation in the poly-C stretch at np 16193 was not used, while the variation at np 309 is indicated only when phylogenetically relevant. Mutations are shown on the branches. They are transitions unless a base change is explicitly indicated; insertions are suffixed with a plus sign (+) and the inserted nucleotide(s), and deletions are characterized by "d"; back mutations are
highlighted by "@"; recurrent mutations are underlined. Dating is reported in kilo years. Some sequences are incomplete: *
from 3694 to 3738 nps; ** from 8353 to 8472 nps. For the ethnic/geographic origins of the samples, see Additional file 2. Population codes: Th-CI and Th-CII: Central Tharus; Th-E: Eastern Tharus; H-ND: Hindus from New Delhi; H-Te: Hindus from
Terai; AP: Andhra Pradesh; UP: Uttar Pradesh; N-In, NE-In, S-In: North, North-East, South Indians, respectively; PK: Pakistan.

state of Gujarat [12]. U9 is a rare haplogroup previously
observed in Pakistan [42], Yemen and Ethiopia [23,53].
Interestingly, the U9 mtDNA that we found in Andhra
Pradesh, together with an Ethiopian mtDNA, defines the
new U9a sub-group (Figure 5), thus confirming the
ancient genetic links between East Africa, Southwest Asia
and India.
Although the West Eurasian component is probably primarily related to migrations during the Holocene period,
the exact source and time of such migrations is difficult to
establish [12,45].

The Indian component
This is the major component of the Indian groups and
also of the Eastern Tharus (Figure 6a) and is represented
by 36 haplogroups, one third of which are shared between
Tharus and Indians and seven are present only among
Tharus (Figure 2). Since this component showed a more
complex genetic relationship between Tharus and Indians, in addition to the M* samples, other selected mtDNAs were completely sequenced, to obtain a deeper
haplogroup phylogeny. The parsimony trees, illustrated in
Figures 4 and 5, include 81 sequences, 34 of which are
from the present study comprising one exogenous

from Japan and one from Ethiopia). Ten sequences
belonging to Hg M did not enter in any of the previously
described haplogroups: five clustered as three new haplogroups M51, M52 and M53 and five resulted as single lineages. The latter five can be used as references for new
haplogroup by affiliation of mtDNAs classified only for
the control region such as, for example, sequence #3,
whose HVS-I motif has been described in one Koya of
Andhra Pradesh [11] and one Sudra of Bangladesh [52].
All the other sequences could be assigned to known M
and R haplogroups, either as direct basal derivatives or as

components of subgroups, contributing to an improved
definition of the mtDNA tree and a refinement of age estimates.
mtDNA phylogeography
The new haplogroups M51 and M52 were detected in the
eastern part of the Indian subcontinent, while M53 seems
to belong to the West Indian area. As for the new subclades of previously described haplogroups, M4c, linking
one Tharu of Chitwan with one Indian from Andhra
Pradesh [30], could be typical of Tribal groups, and M43a,
is observed at the Indian border with Nepal. Sub-clade

and Uttar Pradesh [30]), whereas M5a2 is present in
Southern India [28,30]. Both haplogroups M33 and M35
show many inner branches, but while M35 is diffused
inside the Indian subcontinent, relating the Tharu groups
and the Hindu from New Delhi with populations of
South India, M33 is also spread elsewhere. Indeed, its subclade M33a includes one Egyptian mtDNA, thus connecting the Indian subcontinent with North Africa, whereas
M33b, described in Western Bengalese [30] and in the
Indian region of Megalaya [31], has been observed in
Eastern Tharus. Therefore, it may represent a clade of the
Northeast Indian subcontinent.
Of particular interest is the detection of haplogroups M21
and M31 (two subjects each) among the central Tharus.
The Tharu M21 sequence (Figure 5) shares nine mutations
with one of the three M21 lineages found in all Orang Asli
groups of Malaysia [24] and in other groups from Southeast Asia [44], belonging to the sub-group M21b. The
Tharu M31 sequence, together with one Megalaya mtDNA
[31], clusters with one West Bengal Rajbhansi [21,27] and
defines a sub-group of M31b. This subclade, together with

As for the R haplogroups, R7 and R30 are of particular
interest. Very informative for the structure and for the age
evaluation of haplogroup R7 is the Andhra Pradesh
sequence #56 (Figure 5) that defines an extremely deep
branch of the R7 in India. This branch shares with the root
of the phylogeny of Chaubey et al.[54] only the mutations
13105, 16319 and, in addition, it does not display the
16260 and 16261 mutations characterizing the R7a and
R7b branches observed in different R samples from Indian
groups [11,52,54-57] and, interestingly, in one R7 Tutsi
from Rwanda (unpublished data). Two Tharu mtDNAs,
one from Chitwan and one from Eastern Terai, belong to
the R30 haplogroup. The first is closely related to two
Indian sequences, one from Andhra Pradesh and the other
from Uttar Pradesh, and contributes to define a sub-clade
of the R30a [54]. The second joins a Punjab sequence [54]
with a Japanese deep lineage [22] indicating an ancient
link between India and Japan. A more recent connection
with Japan is, in turn, revealed by the F1d haplogroup
showing a tight linkage between an Eastern Tharu
sequence and two Japanese mtDNAs. Another noteworthy
connection with outside areas is evidenced by the U9 haplogroup that, being shared by an Ethiopian and an Andhra
Pradesh mtDNA, reveals a not recent link between Ethiopia and India.
Even if the PC analysis of mtDNA haplogroup frequencies
observed in the present study compared with those of relevant populations accounts for only about a quarter of the
variance, four main clusters are defined: West Eurasian
[12], Indian area [12,42,55,56], East Asian [58-60], and
Southeast Asian [44] (Figure 7). The first two are well-distinguished from the others by the first PC, which points
out a separation between the West and the East Eurasian
gene pools; afterwards, the second PC distinguishes West
Eurasians from Indians and East Asians from Southeast
Asians. Tharu groups are located in the middle of the area
among the clusters but, while the central groups are closer
to East Asians, Eastern Tharus turned out to be closer to
the Indians. Other samples from the border between India
and Nepal, such as those from Uttar Pradesh, remain
inside the Indian cluster (including the group Th-Up composed of marginal "Hinduized" Tharus [12]. As for Indians, they all group together, in agreement with a deep
(Late Pleistocene) common maternal ancestry of caste and
tribal populations [11,60], perhaps due to some accepted
practices (such as the anuloma) that allow a woman of a
lower social level to enter a higher level by marriage
[55,61].

additional DHPLC/sequencing analyses of P31 chromosomes are necessary to evaluate the extent of the contemporary presence of the two mutations. It is worth noting
that these samples were also all positive for the PK4
marker recently observed in four Pakistani Pathans [36].
Another variation, consisting of an A to G transition at np
147, was observed in two H-M82 samples while sequencing the M89 marker. This mutation, which was not found
either in H-M69* or in H2-APT chromosomes, characterizes the H1 subgroup but, due to the impossibility of typing all the M82 samples, as well as any M370* and M52*
Y chromosome, at present, we cannot define the precise
phylogenetic position of this novel transition inside the
sub-haplogroup.

The Y-chromosome
The phylogeny and frequencies of the 28 Y-chromosome
haplogroups observed in the present study are shown in
Figure 3.

Two new variants are reported. The first, M481, defines
the new haplogroup F5 and consists of a C→T transition
at np 163 within the STS containing the P36 mutation
[62]. The second, Tdel, was first noticed in haplogroup
O2-P31 while typing the P31 marker and was confirmed
by sequencing. This is due to a T deletion in the 6T stretch
starting at np 127, adjacent to the P31 T to C transition
[63]. The T deletion, not found in the other examined Hg
O derivatives, is always present in our O2 samples (all tribals; four of the Eastern Tharus and one from Andhra
Pradesh). Taking into account that this haplogroup is
often recognized through markers different from P31 and
that in other studies, where the P31 was examined
[64,65], a technique not detecting Tdel was employed,

On the basis of known or supposed haplogroup origin
[11,14,15,36,56,62,64-72], three main components (East
Asian, West Eurasian and Indian) can also be identified
for the Y chromosome. The incidence of the various components in each population is depicted in the histograms
of figure 6b.
The East Asian component made up by haplogroups
C(xC5), D, N, O3, Q, and K*, and mainly represented by
Hg O3, is, on the whole, much more frequent among Tharus (39.8%) than among Indians (7.7%). The high Tharu
frequency, mostly accounted for by the subgroup O3M117 (83.8%), shows a wide range in the three groups
with significant differences between Th-CI vs both Th-CII
(P < 0.02) and Th-E (P = 0.001). Among the less represented East Asian markers of interest is Hg D that is very
frequent in Tibet, absent in other Nepalese populations
[37] but present in six Central Tharus: as D1-M15 in two
Th-CI subjects and as D*-M174 in four Th-CII subjects.
The latter, by showing the DYS392 -7 repeat allele that
characterizes the D3-P47 chromosomes [37], could
belong to the recently identified Hg D3* [73]. In addition,
two other haplogroups were encountered: K-M9* in a single Eastern Tharus and Q1-P36 in two Tharus-CII. Hg Q,
which is present in Tibetans, was seen in only one sample
from Kathmandu [37]. In Indians, the very scarce East
Asian component was represented by three Hg O3 (each
belonging to a different sub-haplogroup and to a different
Indian sample), one C3-M217 in Terai (previously
observed only in a few Kathmandu and Tibetan samples
[37]), two N1-LLY22g*, one in Terai and one in New
Delhi and by three Q1-P36 in New Delhi. Only three East
Asian haplogroups, Q1-P36, O3-M134* and O3-M117,
are shared between Tharus and Indians.
The West Eurasian component, represented by haplogroups E, G, and J, shows a higher incidence among Tharus (15.9%) than among Indians (7.7%). With the
exception of three E3-M35* Eastern Tharus and two GM201 (one in New Delhi and the other in Andhra
Pradesh), the main part of this component is accounted
Page 9 of 16

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:154

for by haplogroup J (Tharus 14.0%, Indians 5.8%),
present only as J2, namely J2-M410* and J2-M241*.
Whereas the latter haplogroup is shared by all Indian and
Tharu samples, the J2-M410* was found in all Tharus but
in only one Hindu of New Delhi, where one sample of its
derivative J2-M68 was also present. If one considers the
total frequency of this component in each sub-group,
among Indians the highest value is observed in the Hindus of New Delhi (10%), and, among Tharus, in the
group of Eastern Terai (30%). It is noteworthy that the frequency of Eastern Tharus is about three times higher than
that of the other two Tharu samples (P ~ 0.03 vs Th-CI and
0.02 vs Th-CII). This component may reflect several events
of gene flow from the Early Holocene to the present, passing through Neolithic farmers.
The Indian subcontinent component includes lineages of
haplogroups C, F, H, L, O, R and among Indians it ranges
from 80% in the New Delhi sample to 85% in Terai, and
to 90% in the Andhra Pradesh. Among Tharus, with the
exception of an incidence of ~32% in the Th-CI group, it
reaches values around 50% in the other two groups. Hgs
H and R are the most frequent haplogroups of this component. Hg H (Tharus: 25.7% Indians: 18.3%) is represented by five sub-groups: H-M69*, H1-M52*, H1M370*, H1-M82* and H2-APT. Whereas H-M69* was
detected at similar frequencies (mean 8.8%) in all the
Tharu sub-groups, and in two Indians of Andhra Pradesh
(6.9%), H1-M82* was seen in all Tharus and Indians. By
contrast, H1-M52* (2.0%) and H1-M370* (6.1%) were
seen only in the New Delhi Hindus, and H2-APT (11.7%)
only in the Tharus-CII.
Hg R, besides a single R* from New Delhi, was detected
in all groups as R1a1-M17* and R2-M124 with important
differences between Tharus (13.5%) and Indians
(52.9%), mainly due to R1-M17* (8.8% vs 41.3%).
Within the two populations, significant differences were
also observed: the Tharu-CII sample differs from the Eastern one (3.9% vs 16.2%, P ~ 0.05); the Hindus from Terai
(69.2%) appear very distant from both the New Delhi
Hindus (34.7%, P < 0.01) and the Andhra Pradesh tribals
(27.6%, P ~ 0.005). However, this important difference
could be, at least partially, influenced by the genetic background of the sample that in recent times moved from
India to Nepal after malaria eradication.
The Indian component can be resolved into the most
likely endogenous (local) haplogroups (C5, F*, H, the
two new F5-M481 and O2a1a-Tdel), and the interregional ones (L, R1 and R2). In the first group we have
included the lineage HgO2-P31-Tdel found in the tribals
of both Eastern Tharu and AP Indian samples. The T deletion further characterizes the HgO2-M95 clade that is considered a genetic footprint of the earliest Palaeolithic
Austro-Asiatic settlers in the Indian subcontinent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/154

[14,71,74], and also as an autochthonous Indian AustroAsiatic population marker [72]. The remaining endogenous haplogroups include haplogroup C5-M356, shared
between Indians and Tharus (two in the Terai Hindus and
one in the Tharus-CII), haplogroup F-M89* and its new
derivative F5-M481, both considered as tribal markers
and observed in Andhra Pradesh (10.3%). As for the interregional haplogroups L-M20, R1-M17 and R2-M124, they
display within India a considerable frequency and haplotype associated high microsatellite variance. However,
whereas this observation for the subgroup L1-M76 of LM20 and for R2-M124 showing lower frequencies outside
this region, is considered indicative of a local origin, for
R1-M17 the situation is more complex, as well as the position of L-M20*. Actually, the high frequency of the R1M17 haplogroup found in the Central Eurasian territory,
together with its gradient of diffusion that was associated
with the Indo-European expansion [74-76], would leave
some uncertainty about its geographic origin. However,
the high microsatellite variation supports an ancient presence, dated in our samples over 14 ky [see Additional file
3] of the M17 marker in the Indian subcontinent, as suggested by Kivisild et al. [11], and sustained by Sengupta et
al. [15] and Thanseem et al. [71], who consider the IndoEuropean M17 only a contribution to a local Early
Holocene pre-existing Indian M17. Thus, it is reasonable
to assume that even this inter-regional haplogroup has
ancient relationships with the Indian area. Interestingly,
the M17 Y-chromosomes of the Indian subcontinent differentiate from those of Central Eurasia in that they are
virtually all 49a,f/TaqI Ht 11 [77].
As to the rare haplogroup L-M20*, it was present in two
individuals of the New Delhi sample. Only one of these Ychromosomes could be analyzed for the microsatellites
and compared in a network with other seven available
samples L-M20* of Turkish and Italian origin (unpublished data), showing that it was very distant from the others.
Age estimates of the main haplogroups with some comparative data [15] are reported in Additional file 3.
Although age estimates deserve caution, particularly when
samples are small and standard errors large, a good general agreement between the two datasets is observed. As
for haplogroup H1-M82*, not reported by Sengupta et al.
[15], its age is very similar in all groups, with variance
(0.093–0.110) lower than that (0.19) previously observed
in some Indian groups [11]. Special attention is deserved
by haplogroups J2-M410*and R1-M17*, showing variances very different in the various Tharu and Indian subgroups and the highest values in the Eastern Tharus and
tribals of Andhra Pradesh. Interesting is also Hg R2-M124
for which the Tharu total variance rises to 0.271, a value
obtained by adding just two samples from the other Tharu

The PC analyses of the haplogroup frequencies, which
were performed with the Nepalese and Tibetan data of
Gayden et al. [37] and the Indian caste and tribal groups
of Sengupta et al. [15], are illustrated in Figure 8a,b. In
both plots, a cluster of tribals, including Tharus and the
Indians from Andhra Pradesh, is evident and separated
from the caste groups. As for the Nepalese populations, all
are very distant from Tibetans. Tharus, with the Eastern
group always in a peripheral position, cluster together in
the same quadrant of the plot, distinct from those occupied by the other three Nepalese groups.

The Middle Eastern signature of the Tharus
West Eurasian markers are virtually absent in the mtDNA
of Tharus, whereas they are present in their Y chromosomes essentially as J2-M410* and J2-M241*, with a frequency peak (30%) in the eastern sample, where three EM35 chromosomes were also observed. These latter, all
displaying the same microsatellite haplotype, could be
attributed to recent gene flow from the Middle East or, as
previously reported for the Indian Siddis, from Africa
[80,81]. By contrast, both sub-haplogroups of J are indicative of various connections with the Middle East. J-M410,

The East Asian signature of the Tharus
Like Tibetans and other people of Nepal [37] the greater
part of the East Asian influence in the Tharus may be
mainly traced back to Tibeto-Burman speakers who
entered Northeast India within the last 4.2 ky [78] and
likely influenced them through a founder effect. Indeed,
East Asian mtDNA haplogroups present in the Tharu
samples show lower genetic variation: all control-region
haplotypes are similar [see Additional file 1] and do not
cover the variety found within the Tibeto-Burman populations [79]. In particular, B5a, D4, G2a mtDNAs are
present among Tharus, whereas B4, D5 mtDNAs as well as
haplogroups A, M7 and R10 were not observed. Signatures of this influence are also seen in the Tharu Y chromosomes that are almost completely represented by
haplogroup O3-M117. Interestingly, Tibetan markers not
present in the other Nepalese populations [37] are
revealed in the Central Tharus by haplogroups D (4.5%)
and Q (0.7%) of the Y chromosome.

Discussion
The analysis of mtDNA and Y chromosome polymorphisms in three Tharu samples from Central and Eastern
Terai has enlightened the presence of three main components, Oriental, West Eurasian and Indian, that show
remarkable quantitative and qualitative differences

the same group.

Europe [13,82-84], shows variance values of 0.346 in the
Tharus and 0.339 in Indian groups [15]. These values are
lower than those (0.467 and 0.479) observed in Anatolia
[13,82] and (0.410) in Southeast Europe [83,84] and

therefore are compatible with a dispersal of this lineage
from somewhere in the Middle East/Asia Minor. The situation of J-M241* is more difficult to interpret. The variance of this lineage shows a value of 0.437 in the Tharus
which is higher than that (0.328) obtained from the
Indian data of Sengupta et al. [15], thus suggesting a preNeolithic presence of J-M241* in the Indian subcontinent.
The Indian background
A great majority of the Tharu mtDNA and Y-chromosome
gene pools is represented by lineages shared or derived
from Indian haplogroups. In particular, Tharus share with
Indians ancient mtDNA haplogroups (see for example,
the M clades M31, M33, M35, M38, the new M52 and also
the R30, almost all dated ~30 ky) and Y-chromosome
haplogroups (such as H-M69, O2-P31Tdel, R1-M17* and
R2-M124) that, in the isolated malaria-resistant Tharus of
Terai, could be retained. Therefore, Tharus might have
been structured in situ by major demographic episodes of
the past, and then by relatively minor gene flows due to
subsequent migrations.
Tharu gene pool: a reservoir of variation generated by
local differentiations and by traces of different migratory
routes
The remarkable qualitative heterogeneity of the three
components and of the age of their haplogroups in the
total populations and in their sub-groups [see Figures 4
and 5 and Additional file 3] makes it possible to set them
in a temporal background and to identify links between
the various populations of the Indian subcontinent, as
well as with populations outside this area.

Of particular interest is the link emerging between Tharus
and tribals from Andhra Pradesh, as well illustrated by the
Y-chromosome PCA plots (Figure 8) and by the high prevalence in these two populations of the local Y-chromosome haplogroup component (Figure 9), in comparison
to the Hindus and to the other populations of Nepal [37]
where the inter-regional component is clearly predominant. This further supports a deep common ancestry
between Tharus and Indians, probably due to the legacy of
the first settlers who arrived from the Indian coasts during
the out-of-Africa dispersal. Subsequently, the high level of
consanguinity inside numerous social boundaries, along
with the influences of evolutionary forces such as longterm isolation, could be responsible for the development
of local genetic variants stemming out from the same
founders, as seen for mtDNA haplogroups M43, M51,
M52, R30a in figures 4 and 5.
Useful in further elucidating and deepening these processes has been the complete sequencing of informative
mtDNAs, especially belonging to haplogroup M.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/154

The links between the Central Tharus and the Andaman
Islanders through Northeast India (Hg M31), between the
Eastern Tharus and Japan (Hg R30) and between Central
Tharus and Malaysia (Hg M21), are ancient. However,
whereas our results are in agreement with an Indian ancestor for haplogroup M31 [27], they are not informative
about the origin of haplogroup M21 (observed in two
Tharus-CII), given its Southeast Asian frequency and variation [44]. Haplogroup R30 could represent a relic of the
postulated out-of-Africa South Coastal Route [24],
whereas M33, together with U9a, indicate ancient links of
India with North and East Africa. These events of gene
flow, however, according to the divergence times (20.6 +
10.3 and 23.1 + 7.7 ky, respectively), would have occurred
more recently than those previously described and dated
to about 40–45 ky [43].
Sex-specific influences
Clear sex-biased frequencies emerged from these analyses.
This is particularly evident for the East Asian contribution
that shows a decreasing trend from Central to Eastern Tharus and is more strongly represented in the mtDNA than
in the Y-chromosome data set. By contrast, the West Eurasian contribution, extremely scarce and even absent in
the Tharu mtDNA, accounts from 12% to 30% of the Ychromosome data set. As for the Indian component, it is
well represented in all groups, with the highest frequencies in the Eastern Tharu mtDNA and in the Y chromosomes of Tharu-CII.

Apart from genetic drift, these sex-specific influences can
be ascribed to all those human movements with different
male/female composition. Thus, whereas the first human
dispersals involved both males and females, more recent
immigrations, involving mainly men [85], gradually
diluted the ancient local Y-chromosome pool. A clear
example of a recent sex-biased influence emerged in the
comparison between lower and the northern upper casts,
the latter receiving in the last few thousand years, a IndoEuropean male genetic input from the North [86,87].
Thus, the differentiation between tribal and non tribal
groups is evident for the Y chromosome (Figure 8)
whereas a major similarity characterizes the two groups
for mitochondrial DNA (Figures 7).
Comparison with other Nepalese populations
By considering the Nepalese populations examined by
Gayden et al. [37], apart from the homogeneous Tamang
sample that displays almost exclusively the East Asian
haplogroup O3-M134, the Newar and Kathmandu
groups, like Tharus, show an important Indian component. However, whereas in the first two, the inter-regional
haplogroups are most represented, in the Tharus the local
ones are prevalent (Figure 9). Both quantitative and qualitative differences emerge from the East Asian component:

Histograms of the Indian local (Hgs: C5, F, H, L1, O2a1a1) and inter-regional (Hgs: L* and R) components

on the whole it is most frequent and heterogeneous
among Tharus, especially in the Chitwan groups which, in
addition to the frequent Hg-O3-M117, show the Hgs D
and Q, reflecting a Tibetan influence. The West Eurasian
component, virtually absent in the Tibetan sample, is represented in Newar and Kathmandu groups with frequencies of 7.6% and 10.4%, respectively. It is interesting to
note however, that the Newar sample in addition shows a
substantial presence (10.6%) of the R1-M269 haplogroup
not found in all the other examined populations.

Conclusion
The analyses carried out on the mtDNA and Y chromosome of the Tharus, one of the oldest and the largest indigenous people of Terai, have shown a complex genetic
structure within which are identifiable: i) a deep common
ancestry between Tharus and Indians, not previously
reported, more evident for mtDNA but also revealed by
the prevalence of the local Indian Y-chromosome subcomponent, as in the tribals of Andhra Pradesh; ii) a significant East Asian genetic contribution both in the male
and female gene pool; iii) a western heritage, clearly evident for the Y-chromosome; iv) a remarkable heterogeneity of the Tharu population (with the Eastern Tharus more
dissimilar to the others) ascribable both to various exogenous influences and to subgroup specific lineages stemming from a shared genetic background with Indians.

Particularly informative has been the complete mtDNA
sequencing that further supports a deep differentiation of
mtDNA haplogroups in the Indian subcontinent, indicating that some branches are geographically or socially specific, while others are widespread. The improvement in
the mtDNA phylogeny has also allowed the identification
of ancient relationships between Tharus, not only with
the Indian subcontinent area, including Pakistan, but also
with the Andaman Islands, Malaysia, and Japan, as well as
between India and North and East Africa. The new
sequence data also allow a better definition of the genetic
relationships among Indian populations at the microgeographic level. Indeed many control-region data from the
literature, if compared to the mtDNA sequences of the
present study can now be classified into known haplogroups.
Moreover, the importance of genetic isolates in revealing
variants not easily detectable in the general population
has clearly emerged.
