Abstract

Background

the nearly finished human and draft mouse genomes have,
however, revealed an excess of small rearrangements and an
extraordinary density of breakpoints within particular
regions of the genome [3,5]. Many anecdotal reports have
described apparent associations between segmental duplications and alterations in orientation and order between the
human and mouse genomes [6-9]. Such regions of recurrent

The random-breakage model has been the dominant paradigm of chromosomal evolution since the seminal work of
Nadeau and Taylor [1]. At a gross level of resolution, comparative vertebrate mapping and sequencing efforts have, in general, upheld the apparent random nature of chromosomal
rearrangements [2-4]. Recent detailed analyses comparing

interactions

Conclusion: These results indicate that segmental duplications are associated with syntenic
rearrangements, even when pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions are excluded. However,
segmental duplications are not necessarily the cause of the rearrangements. Rather, our analysis
supports a nonrandom model of chromosomal evolution that implicates specific regions within the
mammalian genome as having been predisposed to both recurrent small-scale duplication and largescale evolutionary rearrangements.

refereed research

Results: We report an abundance of primate-specific segmental duplications at the breakpoints of
syntenic blocks in the human genome. Using conservative criteria, we find that 25% (122/461) of
all breakpoints contain ≥ 10 kb of duplicated sequence. This association is highly significant (p <
0.0001) when compared to a simulated random-breakage model. The significance is robust under
a variety of parameters, multiple sets of conserved synteny data, and for orthologous breakpoints
between and within chromosomes. A comparison of mouse lineage-specific breakpoints since the
divergence of rat and mouse showed a similar association with regions associated with segmental
duplications in the primate genome.

Background: Chromosomal evolution is thought to occur through a random process of breakage

breakage suggest an alternative model of chromosomal evolution, termed 'fragile breakage' [5,10]. The molecular basis for
such fragility is not understood.
In our studies of recent human segmental duplication, we
have been impressed by the apparent correspondence
between breakpoints in conserved synteny and blocks of segmental duplication (Figure 1a, which shows a graphic of chromosome 7). However, caution must be exercised in
comparing regions of segmental duplication and breakpoints
in synteny. It is well known that large expanses of genomic
sequence near telomeres and pericentromeric regions of the
human genome have emerged almost solely through segmental duplication events during primate evolution [11-13]. Such
regions, therefore, would create artifacts if not properly
excluded during global analyses. Using available genomic
sequence data from human, mouse and rat, we sought to formally test the significance of this association by comparing
the distribution of segmental duplications and conserved syntenic breakpoints where unique sequence was the basis for
the assignment of syntenic breakpoints.

Results

In this study we sought to determine the relationship between
recent human segmental duplications and breakpoints in
conserved synteny. Comparison of duplications and syntenic
breakpoints is complicated by the fact that duplicated
sequence can create potential non-orthologous assignments
owing to the high degree of sequence identity to multiple locations within a genome. Alternatively, duplicated regions may
lead to the inability to map a block of sequence to a particular
orthologous locus, creating a de facto gap within the 'syntenic
map'. To eliminate these potential problems, we applied a set
of conservative criteria. First, we only considered breakpoints
where orthologous sequence anchors had been unambiguously placed within unique sequence and the overall length of
the conserved syntenic segment was ≥ 100 kb. A breakpoint
was identified as either a change in orientation or in chromosomal location based on unique regions within the human
genome. We ignored apparent gaps in conserved synteny in
the human genome where flanking regions had the same
chromosome and orientation assignment in the mouse.
In our analysis we considered only pairwise alignments (≥ 1
kb in length, ≥ 90% sequence identity) representing primatespecific segmental duplications within the human genome
[14]. Segmental duplications are duplications of apparently
normal genomic DNA that often contain genes or genic segments as well as common transposable elements. Using two
independent methods of assessment [14,15], we have mapped
the precise location of segmental duplications within the
most recent human genome sequence assemblies (see Materials and methods). The working-draft nature of the mouse
genome currently underestimates the content and location of
recent duplications because of the effective collapse of

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/4/R23

whole-genome shotgun sequence [3]. As part of our analysis of
conserved synteny, we excluded human pericentromeric and
subtelomeric regions, where multiple megabases of recently
acquired duplications have accumulated [14]. Comparative
studies have shown that most of these regions have emerged
as a consequence of primate-specific duplication events.
Computational and phylogenetic analyses confirm that these
regions have been populated by duplicative transposition of
euchromatic sequences over the past 35 million years of evolution [16-19]. These regions are, therefore, derived specifically within the primate lineage and do not contain a
sufficient number of unique sequence anchors to reliably
establish orthologous relationships between rodents and
humans [5,20,21]
We compared the distribution of human segmental duplication and of breakpoints in conserved human-mouse synteny
(human NCBI build 31 and MSGC v.3). By count, 122/461
(26.5%) of the breakpoints contained one or more duplicated
blocks of at least 10 kb in size (Table 1). By sequence content,
breakpoint regions showed an eightfold enrichment for
human segmental duplications (Table 1). To assess the significance of this association, we randomly reassigned breakpoints, without replacement, throughout the entire human
genome. This procedure fixed the size and number of breakpoints, while allowing for their position to vary, effectively
simulating a random-breakage model. The number of duplication-positive breakpoints was calculated for each replicate.
On the basis of 10,000 replicates, the simulated count (maximum 50) never exceeded the observed count of 122, suggesting that this association is unlikely to have occurred by chance
(p < 0.0001) (Figure 2).
In addition, size thresholds for conserved syntenic regions
(200 kb, 500 kb, 1,000 kb) and duplication thresholds (10 kb,
20 kb, 50 kb), were also examined. All parameter combinations showed a highly significant association with human segmental duplications (p < 0.001) (see Additional data file 1).
Conserved syntenic breakpoints both within chromosomes
and between chromosomes showed an association (Figure 1b
and Table 1). We also analyzed two other datasets of mousehuman conserved synteny: the published mouse draft [3] and
a further refinement of the Pevzner-Tesler analyses [5]. Both
sets showed a significant association between segmental
duplication and orthologous breakpoints, suggesting that
methodological differences are not responsible for these
observations (see Additional data files 2 and 3). It should be
noted that if we do not apply these stringent criteria for
assignment of orthologous syntenic blocks and duplicated
breakpoints, the association rises to 555/1,070 breakpoints
(51%).
To examine the potential causal relationship between duplications and breakpoints in synteny requires determination of
the relative timing and therefore the order of these events. On
the basis of the high degree of sequence identity and

no association of primate-specific duplications and mousespecific breakpoints, as they have occurred in two separate
lineages. However, direct causality is not supported as no significant difference (p = 0.4626, chi-squared 1 df = 0.5397)
was observed in the prevalence of associated duplications
between mouse-specific and shared mouse-rat breakpoints.

occurred within the past 35 million years of evolution. Studies
of neutral mutation differences (single base-pair events,
indels and rearrangements) between human and mouse have
suggested an increased rate within the rodent lineage [3]. The
nearly completed draft sequence of the rat genome provides
an additional rodent species for comparison, allowing us to
identify breakpoints that are shared between mouse and rat.
We compared the human and rat genomes for equivalents to
the 439 human-mouse syntenic breakpoints (Table 2).
Mouse-human breakpoints absent in the human-rat comparison suggest rearrangements specific to the mouse lineage

human-rat comparisons suggest rearrangements that

Discussion

Several recent comparative mapping studies in a wide variety
of closely related eukaryotic organisms have shown a relationship between large-scale chromosomal rearrangement
and repetitive DNA. The nature of the repetitive DNA within
these breakpoint regions varies significantly, from clusters of
rRNA and tRNA genes to various transposable elements [2426]. Between human and mouse, an association with segmental duplications and repetitive DNA has been previously suggested although never rigorously tested [6,27]. Recent
published reports of three out of seven different conserved
syntenic breakpoints that distinguish the human and greatape karyotype uncovered segmental duplications precisely at
the site of these breakpoints [28-32]. Interestingly, a few of
these primate segmental duplications also function as breakpoints of recurrent chromosomal structural rearrangements
associated with disease and polymorphism within the human
population [11,32].
In a very recent study, Armengol and colleagues suggested an
enrichment of segmental duplications near sites of evolutionary rearrangement [33]. They reported that 53% of all evolutionary rearrangement breakpoints between human and
mouse associate with segmental duplications, as compared to
18% expected in a random assignment of breaks. This number
is significantly higher than our estimate and is likely to be due
to methodological differences between the two studies. For
example, we specifically excluded highly duplicated pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions because of their dynamic
evolution within the primate lineages and the difficulties
associated with assigning 'true' orthologous relationships.

Duplications and syntenic regions were displayed using the
graphic viewer Parasight [37] for each human chromosome.
This analysis excluded the Y chromosome, which was not
sequenced in the mouse. Our goal was to study breakpoints
between the species that were based on the alignment of
unique sequence. Genomic sequence from each centromere
and telomere to the first conserved synteny that showed
essentially no duplication was excluded from the analysis.
These areas represent highly duplicated pericentromeric and
subtelomeric regions where assignment of human-mouse
orthology is problematic. The syntenic breakpoints and duplications within the remaining genomic regions were then analyzed for association using a series of Perl scripts. Conserved
syntenic blocks less than 100 kb in length and/or composed
of ≥ 75% duplicated bases were deleted to eliminate breakpoints created as a consequence of duplicative transposition.

refereed research

Segmental duplications were detected as pairwise alignments
within the human genome (≥ 90% and ≥ 1 kb) as previously
described and verified by assembly-independent methods
[15,35]. Pairwise alignments were collapsed into a nonredundant set on the basis of genome coordinates, essentially
assigning each base in the genome as duplicated or not. Both
sets of data are available as part of the University of California, Santa Cruz genome browser data [36].

deposited research

Both of these studies considered the location of primate-specific segmental duplications only from the perspective of the
human genome sequence assembly. While it is tempting to
speculate that nonhomologous recombination of blocks of
duplicated DNA might have a direct role in mediating rearrangements [33], the temporal order of these events and
therefore the cause-consequence relationship has not been
previously investigated. In the case of mouse-human comparisons, it seems unlikely that the segmental duplications are
the direct cause of the rearrangement. On the basis of levels
of sequence divergence, the segmental duplications considered in this analysis emerged over the past 35 million years of
primate evolution [11]. In contrast, the conserved synteny
breaks have occurred in both human and mouse lineages
since their separation 75 million years ago. Also, the association is just as strong when only mouse-specific syntenic
breakpoints are considered (Table 2). It is therefore unlikely
that segmental duplications are driving chromosomal rearrangements through nonhomologous recombination, as no
correlation between primate-specific duplications and
mouse-lineage-specific syntenic rearrangements would be
expected. Rather, our analysis supports a nonrandom model
of chromosomal evolution that implicates a predominance of
recurrent small-scale duplication and large-scale evolutionary rearrangements within specific 'fragile' regions of the
mammalian genome. Understanding the nature and pattern

reports

The Armengol study did not make this distinction. Second,
Armengol and colleagues considered shorter segments of
conserved synteny (down to 20 kb in size) that fell within
larger blocks of synteny. In our study, we required large tracts
of unique sequence (> 100 kb) to establish conserved synteny,
purposefully excluding short regions which might provide
false associations due to genomic duplications and deletions
since the divergence of mouse and humans. Using conservative criteria, we find that 25% (122/461) of all breakpoints
contain ≥ 10 kb of duplicated sequence.

To examine the association between duplication and orthologous breakpoints, we initially compared the published mouse
(MGSCv3) and human (Nov 2002 build31) sequence assemblies. Syntenic anchoring regions were built from BLASTZ
mouse-human DNA alignments [34]. High-scoring alignments (≥ 900; calculated as 3 × matches - mismatches - gaps)
were used to define well-conserved syntenic anchor regions
(100 kb regions showing ≥ 10% of the sequence aligned with a
sum alignment score of ≥ 10,000). These anchor regions were
extended if adjacent 100-kb sliding windows matched the
mouse chromosome and orientation with a sum score of ≥
7,000. These extended regions were then joined together if
they agreed in orientation and were within 500 kb of each
other in the human genome and within 4 Mb of each other in
the mouse. These conservative criteria restricted mousehuman synteny comparisons to either large-scale orientation
changes or translocations between chromosomes. For this
study, as a further safeguard against mouse misassembly,
gaps between these syntenic segments were joined if the syntenic segments between two flanking regions agreed in terms
of assigned mouse chromosome and orientation. In addition
to this updated mouse-human synteny map, we also considered two earlier published versions of conserved synteny
[3,5].

reviews

Mouse-human breakpoints were classified as either shared with rat or
specific to the mouse assembly. No significant difference in segmental
duplication content was found when shared and mouse-specific
breakpoints were compared. Chi-squared test (χ2 = 0.5397, p =
0.4626). *Forty-two human-mouse breakpoints showed no evidence of
conserved synteny within 1 Mb of the breakpoint when the human and

Bailey et al.

Breakpoint regions were defined as the gaps between syntenic
blocks that represented a difference in mouse chromosome
assignment or orientation of unique sequence. Gaps within
conserved synteny were not counted as breakpoints (although
shown in Figure 1a). Breakpoint regions were scored as duplication positive if the duplication content exceeded 10 kb
(Table 1; 122/461 breakpoints).
To assess the significance of the duplication-breakpoint association, computer simulations of a random-breakage model
reassigned the observed breakpoints to random positions
within the genome. This was done without replacement, and
the positions of breakpoints were limited in that they could
only be placed as close together as the minimum length of the
syntenic regions assayed (100 kb). For each replicate, the
number of duplication-positive breakpoints was calculated as
well as the number of duplicated bases within the breakpoints
(see Additional data file 1). It is important to note that our
assessment is conservative in its approach. A similar analysis,
removing size constraints and including pericentromeric and
subtelomeric regions, shows that up to half of all breakpoints
(555/1,070 = 51%) are associated with segmental
duplications.
To determine the robustness of the association, a variety of
syntenic size thresholds (100 kb, 200 kb, 500 kb, 1,000 kb)
and duplication-positive thresholds (10 kb, 20 kb, 50 kb)
were assessed (see Additional data file 1). Because such an
association may be due to methodological considerations
regarding the initial ascertainment of conserved syntenic
blocks, we examined two other datasets. The first, published
with the initial mouse draft (human NCBI build30 versus
MGSC version 2), measured conserved syntenic regions with
a minimum size of 300 kb [3]. The second utilized the same
Pattern Hunter genomic alignment anchors but incorporated
a refined algorithm [5] and measured syntenic regions
greater than 1 Mb. Both sets showed significant (p < 0.0001)
enrichment of duplications with breakpoints (see additional
data files 2 and 3).

To determine the timing of mouse-human syntenic breakpoints we examined rat-human conserved synteny (rat v.2.1),
using the same parameters described for human/mouse. For
each mouse-human breakpoint, we examined conserved synteny between human and rat. If the region was not interrupted between human and rat genomes, then the breakpoint
was assigned as mouse-specific. If the breakpoint was shared,
then the mouse-human breakpoint was assigned as common
to the mouse and rat. If no conserved synteny relationship
could be identified within 500 kb on either side of the mousehuman breakpoint, the breakpoint was classified as 'undetermined' and excluded from further analysis. This allowed a
subset of rearrangements to be generally classified into two
different parts of the human-mouse-rat phylogeny. The frequency of duplication-positive and negative breakpoints for
