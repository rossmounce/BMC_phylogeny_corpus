Abstract

Background

eventually adaptation to new ecological niches [1]. In some
cases, gene deletion may prevail over gene acquisition, leading to genome reduction. This process has occurred several
times during evolution and has been well documented for cellular organelles [2,3], obligate pathogens such as Mycoplasma genitalium [4] or phytoplasmas [5] and symbionts
such as the insect endosymbiont Buchnera [6-8] or the

information

The size of bacterial genomes is primarily the result of two
counteracting processes: the acquisition of new genes by gene
duplication or by horizontal gene transfer; and the deletion of
non-essential genes. Genomic flux created by these gains and
losses of genetic information can substantially alter gene content. This process drives divergence of bacterial species and

interactions

Conclusions: We have examined the evolutionary mechanisms involved in this process, which are
different from those known from host-dependent organisms. Indeed, most substitutions that have
occurred in Prochlorococcus have to be selectively neutral, as the large size of populations imposes
low genetic drift and strong purifying selection. We assume that the major driving force behind
genome reduction within the Prochlorococcus radiation has been a selective process favoring the
adaptation of this organism to its environment. A scenario is proposed for genome evolution in this
genus.

refereed research

Results: Our results clearly indicate that genome reduction has been accompanied by an increased
rate of protein evolution in P. marinus SS120 that is even more pronounced in P. marinus MED4.
This acceleration has affected every functional category of protein-coding genes. In contrast, the
16S rRNA gene seems to have evolved clock-like in this genus. We observed that MED4 and SS120
have lost several DNA-repair genes, the absence of which could be related to the mutational bias
and the acceleration of amino-acid substitution.

Background: Three complete genomes of Prochlorococcus species, the smallest and most abundant
photosynthetic organism in the ocean, have recently been published. Comparative genome analyses
reveal that genome shrinkage has occurred within this genus, associated with a sharp reduction in
G+C content. As all examples of genome reduction characterized so far have been restricted to
endosymbionts or pathogens, with a host-dependent lifestyle, the observed genome reduction in
Prochlorococcus is the first documented example of such a process in a free-living organism.

hyperthermophile Nanoarchaeum equitans [9]. In the case
of organelles, the degree of genome reduction can be extensive as a result of massive gene transfer into the host nucleus,
allowing maintenance of the corresponding functions in the
resulting composite organism. Mitochondrial or chloroplast
genomes, for instance, can be as small as 6 kilobases (kb) [10]
and 35 kb [11], respectively. In the case of obligate hostdependent bacteria, the reduction is more limited because the
relationships with their hosts are less intimate than for
organelles in eukaryotic cells. Thus, obligatory pathogens
need to retain a minimum of functions that allow them to
infect new hosts and to avoid host defenses, and obligate
endosymbionts carry genes which are absolutely necessary
for host survival. For instance, a substantial part (approximately 10 %) of the Buchnera genome is devoted to biosynthesis of amino acids which are essential to its host [6].
So far, all characterized examples of genome reduction have
been associated with a change from a free-living to a hostdependent lifestyle [12]. It is therefore intriguing that a similar phenomenon of genome reduction has occurred within the
free-living marine cyanobacterial genus Prochlorococcus [1315]. The latter is present at high abundance (often over 105
cells/ml) in all nutrient-poor areas of the world's oceans
between 40°N and 40°S and is probably the most abundant
photosynthetic organism on Earth [16,17]. It has been shown
that two major ecotypes exist within this genus [18]. The first
is adapted to grow at the base of the illuminated layer and displays a high divinyl-chlorophyll b to a ratio; the second inhabits the upper layer of the ocean and has a low divinylchlorophyll b to a ratio [19]. The genome of one high-lightadapted (HL) strain, Prochlorococcus marinus MED4 [14],
and of two low-light-adapted (LL) strains, P. marinus SS120
[13] and Prochlorococcus species MIT9313 [14], have
recently been sequenced and annotated.
Phylogenetic trees based on 16S rRNA sequences [18] or 16S23S ribosomal internal transcribed spacer sequences [20]
show that Prochlorococcus sp. MIT9313 branches at the base
of the Prochlorococcus radiation, close to the Synechococcus
group [21]. In contrast, the Prochlorococcus HL clade,
encompassing the MED4 strain, appears to be the most
recently evolved Prochlorococcus group, consistent with the
fact that this clade is much less diversified than are the LL
clades.
Despite the close relatedness of these strains, their genomes
vary widely in terms of size, G+C content and the number of
protein-coding genes (Table 1). While the general characteristics of the MIT9313 genome are very similar to those of the
Synechococcus sp. WH8102 genome [22], MED4 has the
smallest genome for a photosynthetic organism known to
date and the SS120 genome is only 90 kb larger. Furthermore,
this genome reduction is clearly accompanied by a drift in
G+C content, a phenomenon that commonly occurs during
the evolution of host-dependent genomes [23]. However, the

evolutionary mechanisms involved in the genome reductive
process are most probably different from those that have
occurred in host-dependent organisms. Using comparative
sequence analyses of the four genomes of marine picocyanobacteria published to date, we have attempted to better
understand the causes and consequences of this phenomenon
and to address the relationships between genome reduction
and niche adaptation in marine picocyanobacteria.

Results
Synteny and genome stability
Alignments of whole genomes show a strong conservation of
the gene order between MED4 and SS120 (Figure 1a). There
are only five inversions larger than 20 kb between these two
genomes. In contrast, the large number of inversions and
translocations and the shorter size of the colinear segments
between SS120 and MIT9313 on the one hand and MIT9313
and WH8102 on the other hand (Figure 1b,c) indicate that
extensive genome rearrangements have occurred not only
between Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus but also
between MIT9313 and the two other Prochlorococcus strains
(see also Figure 2 in [14]). The degree of synteny observed
between the four marine picocyanobacteria genomes
strengthens the hypothesis of a more recent divergence of the
clades containing MED4 and SS120 than of the clade containing MIT9313.

Overall genome composition
The downsizing of MED4 and SS120 genomes during evolution is associated with a genome-wide adenine (A) and thymine (T) enrichment (Table 1). The bias is most pronounced at
neutral sites such as intergenic regions (MED4, 76.6% A+T;
SS120, 69.3% A+T) and third-codon positions of protein-coding genes (MED4, 79.7% A+T; SS120, 73.85% A+T). This bias
has little effect on ribosomal RNA genes (5S, 16S and 23S)
which have a G+C content greater than 50% in all four picocyanobacterial genomes. In both MED4 and SS120, the single
rRNA gene cluster can easily be spotted as a G+C-rich
anomaly compared to the rest of the genome (see for example,
Figure 1 in [15]). In direct contrast, protein-coding genes are

A total of 1,306 orthologs belonging to all major functional
categories are common to the four genomes (see Additional
data file 1) and probably constitute an estimate of the core of
genes conserved in all marine picocyanobacteria. This is sensibly more than the pool of around 1,000 orthologs identified
by W.R. Hess [15]. The difference certainly results from the
use by the latter author of a low E-value threshold (10e-12) for
BLAST comparisons. In contrast, our analysis is based on
identification of reciprocal best hits without the use of any
particular threshold (apart from the default BLAST threshold) and consequently allows the detection of orthologous
relationships whatever the gene lengths or the level of similarity. Still, our ortholog identification process is rather strict
and the set of orthologs identified in this study probably corresponds to a lower estimate of the actual number of
orthologs shared by the four genomes. This set of genes represents a substantial percentage of the total pool of all
protein-coding genes in P. marinus MED4 (73.2%) and
SS120 (69.2%) and about half of the gene set in Prochlorococcus sp. MIT9313 (56.2%) and Synechococcus sp. WH8102
(51.1%). These percentages are consistent with the differences
in the respective number of genes within these genomes
(Table 1) and are compatible with the assumption that a massive gene loss has occurred in MED4 and SS120 during their
evolution from a Prochlorococcus ancestor with a larger
genome [13-15].

strongly affected by the extreme base composition of these
genomes. First, the bias influences codon usage since, for a
given amino acid, AT-rich codons are preferentially used
(Figure 3a). Second, the amino-acid composition of the proteins themselves is affected (Figure 3b). Indeed, when compared to Prochlorococcus sp. MIT9313 and Synechococcus
sp. WH8102, the genes of P. marinus MED4 and SS120 contain fewer amino acids encoded by G+C-rich codons (for
example, alanine or arginine) and more amino acids encoded
by A+T-rich codons (for example, isoleucine or lysine).

(Figure 4 and Table 2). These results imply that the rate of
amino-acid substitution increased during evolution of the
Prochlorococcus genus concomitantly with genome reduction and increase in A+T content.

The ratio of the rate of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN) to
the rate of synonymous substitutions (dS) is commonly used
to measure the relative rate of purifying selection acting at the
protein level. We determined dS and dN for each gene pair of
every group of orthologs and their values were averaged for
each genome. Surprisingly, we observed saturation at synonymous sites for all genome pairs (dS > 2) and the calculation
of the dN/dS ratio was thus impossible. Still, the average dN
was higher between MED4 and SS120 (0.36) than between
SS120 and MIT9313 (0.32). The lowest dN was observed
between MIT9313 and WH8102 (0.24), a finding which is
consistent with the relative acceleration of amino-acid substitutions in MED4 and in SS120.

Accelerated rate of evolution of protein-coding genes
in Prochlorococcus
Because biased base composition seems to constrain aminoacid usage in the Prochlorococcus genomes, we have investigated whether it also affects the rate of protein sequence evolution in these genomes. We used the 1,306 orthologs
common to the four genomes to estimate the amino-acid substitution rate in each genome. Branch lengths calculated for a
given tree topology (the same topology as for the 16S rRNA
gene tree; see Figure 2) are 0.46, 0.22, 0.16 and 0.14 amino
acid substitutions per site for branches dA, dB, dC and dX,
respectively. Using Synechococcus sp. WH8102 as the outgroup, we tested the rate-constancy hypothesis and computed
the ratios of branch lengths. Relative rate tests (two-cluster
and branch length tests) indicate that protein sequences
evolved at significantly different rates (P < 0.001) between
MED4, SS120 and MIT9313. Therefore the hypothesis of a
constant evolutionary rate between these strains can be
rejected for protein-coding genes. The calculation of branchlength ratios reveals that the amino-acid substitution rate is
2.04-fold higher inMED4 than in SS120 (dA/dB) and 3.81fold higher in MED4 than in MIT9313 ((dA+dX)/dC). This
rate is also 2.31-fold higher for SS120 than for MIT9313
((dB+dX)/dC). Computation of branch lengths for each functional category shows that the increased rate of amino-acid

DNA-repair systems
A shift in base composition may reflect the loss of DNA-repair
genes and we therefore determined the presence or absence
of genes involved in these mechanisms. As the mutational
pressure is toward a high A+T content in both MED4 and
SS120, we looked more closely at those genes whose absence
could increase the frequency of G:C to A:T mutations. Among
the genes putatively encoding DNA-repair enzymes identified
in MIT9313 and WH8102, a few are missing in SS120 and/or
MED4 (Table 3). Both MED4 and SS120 lack the ada gene,
which encodes 6-O-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase,
which repairs alkylated forms of guanine and thymine in
DNA. Such alkylations generate lesions that can lead to G:C to
A:T transversions [24]. Interestingly, the MED4 genome is
the only one among the four picocyanobacteria not to encode
the A/G-specific DNA glycosylase MutY, as previously noted
by Rocap and co-workers [14]. This enzyme acts with MutT
(NTP pyrophosphohydrolase) and MutM (formamido-pyrimidine-DNA glycosylase) in the GO system to avoid misincorporation of oxidized guanine (8-oxoG) in DNA and to repair
the base mismatches A:8-oxoG [25]. In Escherichia coli,
knocking out both mutM and mutY translates into a 1,000fold increase of G:C to A:T transversions in comparison to the
wild-type strain [26]. In addition to MutT and MutY,
MIT9313 and WH8102 encode a third enzyme of the NUDIX
hydrolase family that is missing in MED4 and SS120. This
hydrolase could act to prevent mutations. However because
of the broad substrate specificity of this family, one cannot
know with certainty the function of this protein. Likewise, two
genes coding for enzymes of the RecF pathway have been lost
either by both MED4 and SS120 (DNA helicase RecQ) or only
by MED4 (exonuclease RecJ).

The process of genome reduction which has occurred within
the Prochlorococcus radiation has to our knowledge never
been observed so far in any other free-living prokaryote. Since
Prochlorococcus sp. MIT9313 has a genome size very similar
to that of Synechococcus sp. WH8102 (2.4 megabase-pair
(Mbp)), as well as several other marine Synechococcus spp.
(M. Ostrowski and D. Scanlan, personal communication), it is
reasonable to assume that the common ancestor of all
Prochlorococcus species also had a genome size around 2.4
Mbp. Under this hypothesis, the genome reduction which has
occurred in MED4 would correspond to around 31%. By comparison, the extent of genome reduction in the insect endosymbiont Buchnera, as compared to a reconstructed
ancestral genome, is around 77% [27]. The genome of P.
marinus SS120 - and a fortiori the MED4 genome - is
considered to be near minimal for a free-living oxyphototrophic organism [13]. It would seem that genome reduction in these organisms probably cannot proceed below a
certain limit, corresponding to a gene pool containing all the
essential genes of biosynthetic pathways and housekeeping
functions (probably including most of the 1,306 four-way
orthologous genes identified in this study) plus a number of
other genes, including genus-specific as well as niche-specific
genes. For instance, MED4 encodes a number of photolyaserelated proteins, a few specific ABC transporters (for cyanate,
for example; [14] and data not shown). These specific compounds might be critical for survival in the upper water layer,
which receives high photon fluxes, UV light and is nutrientdepleted, but less so for life deeper in the water column.

repertoires of the two types of organisms differ tremendously.
Indeed, the genome evolution of endosymbionts and obligatory pathogens is driven by two main processes which have
mutually reinforcing effects on genome size and evolutionary
rates. Being confined inside their host, these bacteria have
tiny population sizes and are regularly bottlenecked at each
host generation or at each new host infection. Consequently,
they experience a strong genetic drift [28] involving an
increase in substitution rate. This acceleration results in the
accumulation at random of slightly deleterious mutations in
protein-coding genes [8,29] as well as in rRNA genes [29,30].
This genetic drift enhances the downsizing of the genome
through inactivation and then elimination of potentially
beneficial but dispensable genes. Among these, there have
been a number of DNA-repair genes, the disappearance of
which could have further increased the mutation rate [6,3133]. Furthermore, a number of genes may be subject to a
relaxation of purifying selection which is therefore rendered
less effective in maintaining gene function. This relaxation
particularly affects genes which have become useless because
they are redundant in their host genome, such as genes
involved in the biosynthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, fatty
acids and even ATP [4-6,8,9,32]. Selection pressure is also
reduced for genes involved in environmental sensing and regulatory systems, such as two-component systems, because of
the much buffered environment offered by the host [6].

In the free-living genus Prochlorococcus, the very large size of
field populations [34] means that these populations are subject to much lower genetic drift and their genomes are subject
to much stronger purifying selection than are those of endosymbionts and pathogens [35]. Consequently, the observed
accelerated rate of evolution probably results merely from the
increase in the mutation rate, which in turn is probably due to
the loss of DNA-repair genes, even if one should note that, in
P. marinus SS120 only two such genes are missing (Table 3).
We observed a similar acceleration of amino-acid substitutions for all functional categories (Figure 4). This finding is
more consistent with a global increase in the mutation rate
than with relaxed selection, the latter being unlikely to occur
to the same extent at all loci. We also assume that most
amino-acid substitutions that have occurred in Prochlorococcus proteins are neutral; that is, they have not altered protein
function. Indeed, populations of the HL clade which, like
MED4, have the most derived protein sequences of all
Prochlorococcus species, appear to be the most abundant
photosynthetic organisms in the upper layer of the temperate
and inter-tropical oceans [16]. Such an ecological success
would hardly be possible for organisms handicapped by a
large number of slightly deleterious mutations, especially
given the fact that most genes are single copy, and so compensation of gene function is generally not possible. The effect of
the maintenance of a high level of purifying selection on coun-

With this hypothesis in mind, we propose a possible scenario
for the evolution of Prochlorococcus genomes. Using a rate of
16S rRNA divergence of 1% per 50 million years [37], one can
estimate that the differentiation of these two genera is as
recent as 150 million years, as the molecular clock hypothesis
holds for this gene in Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus.
The ancestral Prochlorococcus cells must have developed in
the LL niche, a niche probably left free by other picocyanobac-

refereed research

The mere reduction in genome size per se is a potential source
of substantial economies for the cell, as it reduces the amount
of nitrogen and phosphorus, two particularly limiting elements in the upper part of the ocean, which are necessary, for
instance, in DNA synthesis. Another advantage is that it
allows a concomitant reduction in cell volume. It has been
previously suggested (see, for example [36]) that, for a phytoplanktonic organism, a small cell volume confers two selective advantages by reducing self-shading (the package effect)
and by increasing the cell surface-to-volume ratio, which can
improve nutrient uptake. The first advantage would improve
the fitness of the LL strains, whereas the second would offer
an advantage to the HL strains living in nutrient-depleted
surface waters. Finally, cell division is less costly for a small
than for a large cell. On the basis of these observations, we
assume that the major driving force for genome reduction
within the Prochlorococcus radiation has been the selection
for a more economical lifestyle. The bias toward an A+T-rich
genome in MED4 and SS120 is also consistent with this
hypothesis, as it can be seen as a way to economize on nitrogen. Indeed, an AT base-pair contains seven atoms of nitrogen, one less than a GC base-pair.

deposited research

If it is neither the relaxation of purifying selection nor an
increase in genetic drift that has been the main factor causing
Prochlorococcus genome reduction, an alternative possibility
is that the latter could be the result of a selective process
favoring the adaptation of Prochlorococcus to its environment. The apparently better ecological success in oligotrophic
areas of Prochlorococcus species compared to their close relative Synechococcus [16,34], strongly suggests that the
reduction of Prochlorococcus genome size could provide a
competitive advantage to the former. Indeed, extensive comparisons of the gene complements of these two organisms
show very few examples - at least among genes for which
function is known - of the occurrence of specific genes in
MED4 which could explain its better adaptation (data not
shown). One noteworthy exception is the presence in
Prochlorococcus, but not Synechococcus, of flavodoxin and
ferritin, two proteins that possibly give Prochlorococcus a
better resistance to iron stress. Apart from that, Synechococcus appears more like a generalist, in particular with regard to
nitrogen or phosphorus uptake and assimilation [22], and

should a priori be more suited to sustain competition. Hence,
we assume that the key to the success of Prochlorococcus
resides less in the development of a specific complex or pathway to cope better with unfavorable conditions than in the
simplification of its genome and cell organization, which can
allow this organism to make substantial economies in energy
and material for cell maintenance.

teracting deleterious substitutions is particularly obvious in
the rRNA genes. Contrary to the protein-coding genes, relative rate tests did not show any significant differences in the
rates of evolution of the 16S rRNA genes in the four marine
picocyanobacterial genomes, and thus there is no evidence
that either SS120 or MED4 could have accumulated mutations destabilizing the secondary structure of their 16S rRNA
molecule. One noteworthy consequence of the acceleration in
the rates of evolution of protein-coding genes in Prochlorococcus is that phylogenetic reconstructions based on protein
sequences are biased. Indeed, this leads to much longer
branches for these two strains than for MIT9313. The resulting tree topology most often does not support that obtained
with the 16S rRNA gene, for which the molecular clock
hypothesis holds true according to our analyses. Thus, rRNA
genes are likely to be among the few genes that will give reliable estimates of the phylogenetic distances between
Prochlorococcus strains.

teria. Given the considerable difference in genome size
between the LL strains MIT9313 and SS120, it appears that
genome reduction itself must have started in one (or possibly
several) lineage(s) within the LL niche some time after
Prochlorococcus differentiation from its common ancestor
with marine Synechococcus species. Why the selection has
affected only one (or some?) and not all Prochlorococcus lineages remains unclear. Examination of the gene repertoire of
P. marinus SS120 [13] suggests that this genome reduction
must have concerned the random loss of dispensable genes
from many different pathways. At some point during evolution, some genes involved in DNA repair have been affected;
these would include the ada gene, which may be responsible
for the shift in base composition, but also possibly several
others, not necessarily involved in GC to AT mutation repair
(see Table 3). Loss of these genes may have led to an increase
in the mutation rate and therefore in the rate of evolution of
protein-coding genes, accompanied by a more rapid genome
shrinkage and a shift of base composition toward AT. It is
worth noting that one likely consequence of this genome-wide
compositional shift is the absence of the adaptive codon bias
in the genomes of Prochlorococcus species MED4 and SS120.
AT-rich codons are preferentially used whatever the amino
acid (Figure 3a). Thus, codon usage in these genomes appears
to reflect more the local base-composition bias than the selection for a more efficient translation through the use of optimal codons. The same conclusion has been drawn for other
small genomes with high A+T content [28,38].
Later during evolution (around 80 million years ago, according to the degree of 16S rRNA sequence divergence between
MED4 and SS120) one LL population which probably already
had a significantly reduced cell and genome size must have
progressively adapted to the HL niche and eventually recolonized the upper layer. How this change in ecological niche
was possible is still hard to define. Comparison of the gene set
that differs between the LL-adapted SS120 and the HLadapted MED4 shows that very few genes might be sufficient
to shift from one to the other niche, including a multiplication
of hli genes [39] and the differential retention of genes which
were present in the common ancestor of Prochlorococcus and
Synechococcus, (such as the photolyases and cyanate transporters mentioned above) and were secondarily lost in the
LL-adapted lineages.

similar rate in all genomes. Despite the decrease in G+C content and an accelerated rate of evolution of protein-coding
genes, purifying selection must also act on these genes and
avoid potentially deleterious mutations. We hypothesize that
a reduction in genome size (which allows a concomitant
reduction in cell size and substantial economies in energy and
nutrients) can constitute a selective advantage for life in the
open ocean, both at depths where photon energy is low and in
surface waters where nutrients are scarce.
Genome shrinkage in Prochlorococcus has led to populations
highly specialized to narrow ecological niches, at the expense
of versatility and competitiveness in changing conditions.
Indeed, not only is the distribution of the Prochlorococcus
genus limited to low latitudes (40°N and 40°S, see [34]) but
the different ecotypes are themselves more or less confined to
a restricted part of the euphotic layer [40]; for example, they
experience only limited changes in temperature and salinity.
Paradoxically, because warm oligotrophic areas constitute a
very large part of the world's oceans, the ecological niches
(both LL and HL) occupied by Prochlorococcus species are
huge, and thus this organism appears globally, despite its
specialization, as one of the most successful oxyphototrophs
on Earth.

Materials and methods
Genome sequence data
The complete genome sequences and annotations of Prochlorococcus marinus MED4, P. marinus SS120, Prochlorococcus sp. MIT9313 and Synechococcus sp. WH8102 (accession
numbers: NC_005071, NC_005072, NC_005042 and
NC_005070 respectively) were downloaded from the
Genome division of the NCBI Entrez system. A few additional
genes which were modeled in at least one genome and were
present in the other genomes but not modeled (because of
their small size, for example) were included in our dataset
(see Additional data file 2).

Alignment of whole genomes
Genome sequences translated in their six reading frames
were aligned with the Promer program of the MUMmer 3.0
system [41].

Codon and amino-acid usage

Conclusions

Genome evolution in the free-living genus Prochlorococcus
has similar features to that in host-dependent prokaryotes:
genome reduction, bias toward a low G+C content, acceleration in the evolution rate of protein-coding genes, and loss of
DNA-repair genes. In contrast to the latter organisms, however, in Prochlorococcus this evolution does not appear to be
the result of genetic drift or relaxed selection being exerted on
some gene categories. Indeed, purifying selection is very efficient in Prochlorococcus, as rRNA genes have evolved at a

Codon usage was computed for every open reading frame
(ORF) of each genome with the EMBOSS program cusp.
Amino-acid usage was derived from the results produced by

Identification of orthologous proteins
We used a sequence-similarity based approach which is similar to the procedure used for the cluster of orthologous groups
(COGs [42]). For each genome pair, all-against-all BLAST
[43] comparisons were performed using protein sequences
and reciprocal genome-specific best hits were identified. We

Nucleotide sequences of each group of orthologs were aligned
with Protal2dna according to alignments of their corresponding amino-acid sequences [46]. Pairwise estimates of the synonymous (dS) and non-synonymous (dN) substitution rates
were obtained from the Yn00 program of the PAML 3.13
package [47].

reports

Protein sequences from each of the groups of four orthologous genes were aligned using ClustalW [44] with default
parameters. After exclusion of all gap sites, individual alignments were concatenated in one super-alignment of 388,120
sites. Gamma distances [45] with an alpha parameter of 1
were estimated between each pair of sequences of the superalignment. Phylogenetic branch lengths were calculated from
distances with the ordinary least-squares method [45]. Relative rate tests (two-cluster test and Branch length test) were
applied in order to test the constancy of amino-acid substitution rates between the three Prochlorococcus genomes
(hypothesis of the molecular clock). The same analysis was
applied to orthologs of each functional category.
