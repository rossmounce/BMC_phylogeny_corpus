Abstract
Background: The expansion of amino acid repeats is determined by a high mutation rate and can
be increased or limited by selection. It has been suggested that recent expansions could be
associated with the potential of adaptation to new environments. In this work, we quantify the
strength of this association, as well as the contribution of potential confounding factors.
Results: Mammalian positively selected genes have accumulated more recent amino acid repeats
than other mammalian genes. However, we found little support for an accelerated evolutionary
rate as the main driver for the expansion of amino acid repeats. The most significant predictors of
amino acid repeats are gene function and GC content. There is no correlation with expression
level.
Conclusions: Our analyses show that amino acid repeat expansions are causally independent from
protein adaptive evolution in mammalian genomes. Relaxed purifying selection or positive selection
do not associate with more or more recent amino acid repeats. Their occurrence is slightly
favoured by the sequence context but mainly determined by the molecular function of the gene.

Background
Microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are DNA
tracts composed of 1-6 bp long motifs repeated in tandem. A balance between slippage events, that increase the
purity of the repeat, and point mutations, that tend to
eliminate perfect repeats, determines their length distribution. However, as the slippage rate is higher than the point
mutation rate, the purity of the repeated tract will be an
inverse measure of the age of the SSR [1-3].
Triplet repeats are more common within coding regions
[4], as they are less likely to alter the reading frame and
can be translated into amino-acid repeats (AARs). AARs

are frequently associated with disease [e.g. [5,6]]. Strong
effects on morphology and phenotype have also been
described in dog breeds [7]. Examples of AARs contributing to adaptive evolution [2,8] have been found in case
studies in insects [9], plants [10,11] and mammals [12].
Genomic comparisons have shown that highly variable
AARs have a higher purity in their coding sequence
[13,14]. AAR expansion has been found to correlate with
the non-synonymous rate of substitution [13,15,16] supporting a role of selection in their expansion. The correlation is consistent with either relaxed purifying selection,
or with positive selection; the latter is suggested by case

studies of adaptive evolution [9-12]. Previous studies
[13,15,16] have been restricted in their taxonomic scale,
did not take into account exon boundaries, and did not
integrate potential confounding parameters into their
analyses. Here we perform a systematic study of mammalian genomes. We contrasted AARs in positively selected
genes (PSGs) and non-PSGs [17] to examine their relationship with protein adaptive evolution. We also analyzed other factors correlating with AARs in 6 high
coverage mammalian genomes. The results were confirmed on a dataset of orthologous exons with wider species diversity. Thus, the relative contribution of each
parameter to the expansion of AARs has been determined.
Our results indicate that AAR expansion is not causally
associated to protein adaptive evolution on a genome
scale. However, there is a minor contribution of the GC
context surrounding the AARs for an increased slippage
rate. AARs are over-represented in genes involved in DNA
binding and transcriptional activity.

Results
Recent expansions in mammalian Positively Selected
Genes
Under the hypothesis of AARs as a resource for adaptation, genes that have experienced adaptive evolution are
expected to show more and more recent (i.e. purer) AARs
associated with a higher substitution rate. To test this prediction, we used the PSGs identified in a thorough study
of mammalian genes [17]. First, we compared the amount
of repeat containing genes (RCGs) and non-repeat containing genes (non-RCGs) between positively selected
genes (PSGs) and non-positively selected genes (nonPSGs) (Table 1). A Fisher's Exact Test shows a weak but
significant association between repeats and positive selection (p = 0.042). Repeats were then split in two classes,
young repeats with high purity (>= 0.9) and old repeats
with low purity (<0.9) (Table 1). The PSGs have significantly more young repeats (p = 0.0004), suggesting that
adaptive evolution in mammals could be associated with
recent expansion of repeats.

We also analyzed the physical properties of the AARs. The
Lehninger classification describes four categories of

to perform two different Fisher's Exact Tests.

amino acids: acidic, basic, polar uncharged and hydrophobic amino acids [6]. All simple amino acid repeats
were classified into the corresponding category for PSGs
and non-PSGs (Table 2). The distribution of amino acid
repeats differed significantly between PSGs and non-PSGs
in a chi-square test (p = 0.0003). The differences remain
significant after Yate's correction for continuity [18] (Yates' p
= 0.001) and are mainly due to an excess of repeats of
acidic and hydrophobic amino acids in the PSGs. The
excess of repeats of hydrophobic AARs explains 77.3% of
the differences between PSGs and non-PSGs. However
this excess is essentially due to an excess of Leucine
repeats. Removing these, the Chi-square is not significant
after Yate's correction for continuity (Yates' p = 0.067).
The correlation of amino acid repeats with positive
selection and evolutionary rates is spurious
Previous studies in human and mouse have suggested that
AAR expansion could be favoured by relaxed purifying
selection, repeat length being associated with higher rates
of non-synonymous substitutions [13,15]. While our
analyses of 6 high-quality mammalian genomes confirm
a positive correlation between dN and repeat length (ρ =
0.043, p = 0.002), this is very weak. A stronger correlation
is observed between the average purity of AARs and dN (ρ
= 0.111, p = 1.54·10-12), but there is a similar correlation
with dS (ρ = 0.112, p = 7.8·10-13), and the correlation with
ω, which should be most indicative of selection, is the
weakest (ρ=0.058, p = 0.00017). The similar values of correlation with dN and dS may be related to the correlations
between these rates (dN vs. dS ρ = 0.485, p < 2.16·10-16),
and with the GC context surrounding the repeats (dN vs.
GCcontext ρ = 0.115, p < 2.16·10-16; dS vs. GCcontext ρ = 0.478,
p < 2.16·10-16). Indeed the GCcontext also correlates with
the purity (ρ = 0.09, p = 4.272·10-08) and the number of
AARs (ρ = 0.06, p < 2.16·10-16).

In order to disentangle the effect of these features of gene
evolution we fitted the observed variation to a linear
model and performed an analysis of variance [e.g. [19]].
We performed this analysis on 3 different mammalian
datasets: PSGs, the 6 high-coverage genomes, and orthologous exons (Material and Methods). We detail only the
analyses of the PSG dataset (Tables 3 and 4). The other
two datasets, with a majority of genes under purifying
selection (mean ω = 0.161 ± 0.21), provide similar results
and conclusions with slight variations in the percentage of
explained variance (Additional file 1, Tables S1-S4).
Adaptive AAR expansions should result in high average
purities (i.e., recent or frequent slippage events) and many
AARs per positively selected gene. Although the contribution of evolutionary parameters is statistically significant,
it is minimal and unlikely to be biologically relevant. For
the average purity of the repeats on a gene, ω explains only
0.4% of the variance, while the fact of detecting adaptive

evolution on any branch of the tree (i.e. significant Likelihood Ratio Test) explains <0.1% of the variance observed
for the number of repeats. This shows that the enrichment
for recent repeats observed using Fisher's Exact Test was a
spurious association. Protein length explains 2% of the
variance for AARs, which is not surprising as longer proteins have a greater potential to host repeats. Of note, it
has been shown that positive selection tests are also more
significant on longer proteins [e.g. [19]], which may contribute to the association between PSGs and AARs.
The excess of leucine repeats also appears spurious, as
there is no significant correlation between the ω values of
each branch in the tree and the length of the leucine
repeats (ρ = 0.36, p = 0.25) or their purity (ρ = -0.17, p =
0.59).
GC rich contexts can favour the expansion of amino acid
repeats
The GCcontext is the only parameter highly significant in
both analyses of variance (on AAR purity and on AAR
number). It explains only 1.6% and 0.7% of the variance,
but this is 3-fold more than the percentage explained by ω
or by significant evidence of positive selection. Thus GCrich sequences appear more prone to the expansion of
repeats. To explore this question, we analyzed 16 exons
showing accelerated evolution in primates due to GCbiased gene conversion (gBGC) [20]. Two out of these 16
exons have AARs, or 12% of this small dataset. Interestingly, the purity of these repeats highly correlates with the
GCcontext (ρ = 0.85, p = 0.002, in 10 mammalian

sequences), indicating that a GC increase due to gBGC
might sometimes favour the expansion of AARs.
Previous studies have also shown that nucleotide compositional constraints increasing the GC content at 3rd codon
positions (GC3) influence the expansion of homopolymeric AARs in mammalian and reptilian transcription factors [21]. Analyses of mammalian exons and of complete
protein coding genes (Figure 1) shows that there is a weak,
but highly significant, positive correlation between purity
and GC3 in the DNA sequence surrounding the repeats (ρ
= 0.28, p < 2.2·10-16 and ρ = 0.126, p < 2.2·10-16, for
exons and whole genes, respectively). A Welch's t-test
comparing the GC3 context of exons containing pure and
impure repeats indicates that genes hosting pure repeats
have on average a higher GC3 than impure repeats (0.75
and 0.66 respectively, p < 2.2·10-16). In summary, these
results consistently indicated that in mammals there is a
small but significant increase of AAR expansion in regions
with high GC.
Aminoacid repeats and gene expression
The main reasons that led us to study the relationship
between repeat expansion and expression levels are: 1)
The observed excess of hydrophobic repeats is likely to
lead to aggregation and misfolding in PSGs [22]. 2) The
correlation between substitution rates and GCcontext, that
also correlates with the average purity of AARs, has been
shown to be limited by expression-related purifying selection [23]. 3) In E. coli it has been observed that the stability of the structure around the translation start is directly
related with the expression level [24].

For the 1,057 human and 1,009 mouse genes that contain
at least one AAR, we performed an analysis of variance
including the expression levels in 5 representative organs
as factors. The result shows that expression level has no
impact on the expansion of AARs, measured as average
purity or as number of repeats in the hosting gene (Additional file 1, Tables S5-S8), neither in mouse nor human.
Conversely, the number of AARs proximal to the translation start for human and mouse does not explain, in any
of the 5 organs, the observed variance in the expression
levels. For simplicity we show only the results obtained
for the human brain (Table 5).
In conclusion, we can reject any simple relation between
the presence of AARs or their age, and the expression level
of human and mouse genes.
Molecular function of genes hosting amino acid repeats
We studied the relation between AARs and the Gene
Ontology terms (GO), for Molecular Function, Biological
Process and Cell Component, of all human and mouse
protein-coding genes. As very similar results were
obtained for both species we will report only those
obtained for human.

Genes containing AARs are enriched in a wide variety of
molecular functions, mainly involved in binding, transcription and nuclear structures (Table 6); analyses
accounting for purity or Biological Process of genes with
AARs support these results (data not shown). Including
these molecular function terms in the linear model to
explain the number of AARs per gene, the total percentage
of variance explained by significantly enriched GO terms
is 13.9% for human and 15.2% for mouse (see Table 7 for
human and Table S9 for mouse). This is not the case for
average purity of AARs, for which GC context remains the
main explanatory factor in human (2.73% of variance
explained, Table S10). Finally, the cellular compartment

nucleus is also enriched in genes with AARs, and in genes
with purer AARs (GO:0005634, p < 6.19·10-12).
The ice binding molecular function (GO:0050825) is
overrepresented. But this excess disappears after excluding
the Alanine repeats. This appears to be an annotation bias,
as genes containing alanine-rich repeats are attributed this
function by partial sequence similarity with the InterPro
entry IPR000104 (Antifreeze protein, type I), a special
glycoprotein identified in marine teleosts from polar
oceans[25].

Discussion
In mammals, a positive correlation between dN and repeat
length is weak but statistically significant. This result is
congruent with previous analyses in smaller datasets of
human and mouse genomes [13,15]. The purity of the
AARs per gene or exon shows a similar trend. But these
weak correlations can be explained by the influence of the
GC context surrounding the repeat. High GC content can
generate a sequence context more prone to slippage[21,26-28] and thus expansion of AARs. Indeed we
found an example of this in exons that have experienced
GC-biased gene conversion in primates. Similarly, while
there is an increase in the amount of recent AARs in mammalian PSGs, these recent expansions are better explained
by GC content than by positive selection acting on
codons. Therefore it seems that, in contradiction to previous reports [15], the expansion of AARs is not causally
associated with substitution rates. While purifying selection limits the expansion of AARs[e.g. [29]], this appears
to be distinct from the selective pressure on individual
(aligned) amino acid sites. That means that these repeats
are experiencing not only different mutational processes,
but also particular selective constraints, leading to a more
complex scenario of evolution.
Our analyses, even of individual exons, suggest that
increased substitution rates are not usually linked to the

presence of AARs. However, it is possible that in some particular cases, as has been suggested for Drosophila, the
expansion of AARs can produce compensatory changes on
the neighbouring sites to accommodate the perturbation
generated by the repeat[30]. We also cannot exclude the
existence of adaptive evolution related with AARs[7,8], in
the absence of a good reference neutral model for trinucleotide expansions in proteins. But our results do
show that the selective pressure as measured by codon
models is not related with putative adaptive evolution of
AARs.
AARs in mammalian genes do not seem to affect gene
expression significantly. Unlike repeats which disrupt the
reading frame, and have a strong effect on replication and
transcription stability[31], the tri-nucleotide repeats
might be constrained in a different way. It seems that
repeats located in the promoter region[32] have a stronger

influence on transcription than do AARs, even those near
the transcription start.
The analyses of molecular function confirmed an enrichment in the transcription factor, DNA binding, molecular
transducers and binding categories that is consistent with
previous studies of polymorphic repeats [26,33,34]. The
overrepresentation of transcription factor categories supports the existence of trans effects, as these repeats might
alter the expression of the target genes and end up producing dramatic changes on the phenotype[7]. However,
while the ice-binding protein is involved in hypothermic
resistance in some antartic fishes vertebrates[25,35], its
overrepresentation in alanine-rich mammalian genes is
probably due to an annotation bias.
In general, we found that AARs are located in proteins that
interact with DNA, RNA, ligands or other proteins, so it is
likely that they contribute to adapt or modulate the interPage 5 of 10

Conclusions
Despite the appealing idea of an adaptive role of the
expansion of amino acid repeats, we can rule out a link
with adaptive evolution in mammalian protein-coding
genes as measured by codon models. Genome-wide, GC
content is more relevant to amino acid repeat expansions
than substitution rates. Amino acid repeats are under
strong functional constraints and expand preferentially in
transcription factors and nuclear genes involved in DNA
and/or protein interactions. Why some genes accumulate
more and most recent amino acid repeats requires further
study in a network context, to shed light on the evolutionary dynamics and function of these mutations.

action capacity of these proteins. Longer proteins and
repeat-rich proteins tend to have a higher connectedness
within interaction networks, suggesting that they contribute to an enlarged interaction surface and constitute more
flexible subunits[36]. Some AAR have been recently associated to the presence of repeats to specific domains, such
as signal peptides or transmembrane regions[16], pointing to their role in facilitating molecular interactions of
extreme importance. For example, in the Drosophila ARC
70 cofactor complex, the -130 and -230 subunits contain
an expansion of glutamine residues, a prevalent feature of
sequence-specific activators in Drosophila[37].

Methods
Positively Selected Genes (PSGs)
A recent study in mammals[17] performed a thorough
analysis for detecting positive selection in six mammalian
genomes. A likelihood ratio test for positive selection on
any branch of the phylogeny reported 400 Positively
Selected Genes (PSGs), and 16,129 genes that have not
experienced any detected positive selection in mammals
(non-PSGs). Alignments for these genes were downloaded from the author's website http://comp
gen.bscb.cornell.edu/projects/mammal-psg/lrtall.txt and
screened for repeats.
High-quality Mammalian Genomes
To study the relationship of multiple factors that could be
influencing the expansion of repeats in mammalian
genomes, we used mammalian assemblies with high cov-

erage (ranging from 6-11×) and their corresponding
Ensembl 50 Genes[38]. We compared the genomes of 2
primates (Homo sapiens NCBI36 and Pan troglodytes
CHIMP2.1), 2 rodents (Mus musculus NCBIM37 and Rattus norvegicus RGSC3.4) and 2 domestic species (Bos taurus
Btau_3.1 and Canis familiaris Canfam 2.0).
For each mammalian genome, we downloaded all the
known protein coding genes, with exception of dog and
chimp genomes where, in order to gather the largest accurate dataset, we used the "known by projection" set. The
repeat analyses are restricted to non-redundant one-toone orthologues to an equidistant outgroup, dog in the
case of rodents and primates, and human for the domestic
species. We filtered the genes by keeping the protein corresponding to the longest transcript and excluding all coding sequences that did not begin with a start codon.
Finally the number of genes that were screened for repeats
in each species was 13,926 human, 11,120 chimpanzee,
13,921 mouse, 10,360 rat, 7,073 cow and 7,834 dog
genes.
Orthologous Exons
We downloaded 1,168 orthologous exons alignments
including 9 to12 mammalian species, from the
OrthoMam database [39]. This is a curated database that
contains the amino acid and coding sequence alignments
for each particular exon. The inclusion of these align-

ments allowed studying local AAR expansions without
biases due to regional differences in substitution rates and
GC context along the whole gene. The exon trees were
built using PHYML (substitution model = JTT, estimated
proportion of invariable sites, four categories, estimated
gamma, initial tree with BIONJ) [40]. Evolutionary rates
for each branch where obtained running the free-ratios
model in PAML 4.1 [41] and keeping dN, dS and ω convergent values of 5 replicate runs. Non-convergent or 999 values were not considered in further analyses.
Homo-polymeric Amino-acid Repeats and Purity
As in many previous studies we focused on perfect homopolymeric amino-acid repeats, where we assume that the
expansion of a tri-nucleotide by slippage gave birth to the
repetition of a single amino-acid motif within the protein.
To consider that an amino-acid repeat appeared by
polymerase slippage a minimum threshold of 5 units was
frequently used in the literature [e.g. [8,26]]. We used a
minimum number of 7 units. The reasons for this are,
first, to increase the significance level[6] and, second, to
increase the chance that a repeat locus shows length polymorphism [42,43].

The purity of the nucleotide sequence coding the aminoacid repeat was calculated following the method
described by Laidlaw et al. in 2007[8]that is summarized
in the equation below;

Purity =

Human Genome HG-U133A (A-AFFY-33), whose mapping to Ensembl genes was downloaded from BioMart
[46].

( m−n )

m

where m is the total number of nucleotides coding the
amino-acid repeat and n the number of interruptions or
nucleotide changes with respect to the canonical codon
(the most frequent or most likely to have experienced
expansion by slippage). The presence of AARs was considered for each species independently of the presence of that
repeat in orthologues.
Summary of parameters and estimates
Each gene was screened for homo-polymeric amino acid
repeats within the corresponding protein sequence. The
following parameters were calculated:

i) Weighted Average Purity of the Repeats of a Gene: the
weighted average of the purity estimates of every
amino-acid repeat in the protein sequence of a gene.
The weighting is based on the length of the coding
sequence of each individual repeat, as described in the
following equation;
n

Av.Purity =

⋅

∑ liLPi

(2)

i

where n is the total number of AARs on the proteincoding gene, l is the length in bp of each individual
repeat, P is the corresponding Purity and L the sum in
bp of the length of all AARs in the gene. This measure
allowed us to compare if certain genes contain purer
AARs than others. Note that the vast majority of the
cases correspond to genes hosting only one AAR.
(Additional file 2, Figures SF1 and SF2)
ii) dN and dS: sitewise maximum likelihood estimates
of dN and dS for each orthologous pair were downloaded from Ensembl [38].
iii) GC context (%GC): the GC content of gene after
excluding all regions encoding repeats[44]. Similarly,
we estimated GC3 as the GC content on third codon
positions of the full repeat-free coding dna of the gene
or exon. These parameters depict the sequence context
in which repeats are born.
Gene Expression data
Microarray data of mouse and human tissues were downloaded from ArrayExpress (E-AFMX-4 and E-AFMX5)[45]. E-AFMX-4 uses an Affymetrix Custom Array Novartis Mouse (A-AFFY-39) and E-AFMX-5 uses an
Affymetrix Custom Array - Novartis Human (A-AFFY-40).
Mapping of Ensembl gene on Affymetrix probesets from
these chips was taken from http://biogps.gnf.org/down
loads/. E-AFMX-5 also uses an Affymetrix GeneChip

We extracted expression data for 5 organs in mouse (cerebral cortex, liver, kidney, testis and heart) and human
(brain, liver, kidney, testis and heart). Raw CEL files were
renormalized using the package gcRMA [47] of Bioconductor version 2.2[48]. We used the "affinities" model of
gcRMA, which uses mismatch probes as negative control
probes to estimate the non-specific binding of probe
sequences. The normalized values of expression are in
log2 scale, which attenuates the effect of outliers. Expression values were averaged between replicates and between
multiple probes mapped to a same gene. Probes mapping
to more than one gene were discarded.
GO term enrichment
Over and under representation of GO terms [49] was
tested by means of a Fisher exact test, using the Bioconductor package topGO version 1.8.1 [50]. The reference
set was all Ensembl genes used in the repeats analysis. The
GO annotation of Ensembl genes was downloaded from
BioMart. The "elim" algorithm of topGO was used, allowing to decorrelate the graph structure of the gene ontology, reducing non-independence problems. Gene
ontology categories with a FDR < 20% were reported.

Authors' contributions
FC designed the project, gathered the genomic data, performed most of the evolutionary and statistical analyses,
and wrote the original manuscript. JR gathered the expression and gene ontology data, and performed the analysis
of GO Term enrichment. MRR supervised the work, provided critical comments about the statistical analyses and
the biological discussion, and revised thoroughly the
manuscript. All authors have read and approved the final
manuscript.
