Abstract
Background: The axial complex of echinoderms (Echinodermata) is composed of various primary
and secondary body cavities that interact with each other. In sea urchins (Echinoidea), structural
differences of the axial complex in "regular" and irregular species have been observed, but the
reasons underlying these differences are not fully understood. In addition, a better knowledge of
axial complex diversity could not only be useful for phylogenetic inferences, but improve also an
understanding of the function of this enigmatic structure.
Results: We therefore analyzed numerous species of almost all sea urchin orders by magnetic
resonance imaging, dissection, histology, and transmission electron microscopy and compared the
results with findings from published studies spanning almost two centuries. These combined
analyses demonstrate that the axial complex is present in all sea urchin orders and has remained
structurally conserved for a long time, at least in the "regular" species. Within the Irregularia, a
considerable morphological variation of the axial complex can be observed with gradual changes in
topography, size, and internal architecture. These modifications are related to the growing size of
the gastric caecum as well as to the rearrangement of the morphology of the digestive tract as a
whole.
Conclusion: The structurally most divergent axial complex can be observed in the highly derived
Atelostomata in which the reorganization of the digestive tract is most pronounced. Our findings
demonstrate a structural interdependence of various internal organs, including digestive tract,
mesenteries, and the axial complex.

Background
"Das Dorsalorgan ist von jeher das Schmerzenskind der
Anatomen gewesen." (Johannes Wagner, 1903)

All echinoderms (Echinodermata) possess an axial complex as part of their coelomic and haemal system. This
organ complex is characterized by a structural, functional

and topographic interaction between various primary and
secondary body cavities and is composed of derivatives of
the three paired larval coeloms, i.e. the protocoel and the
mesocoel, both surrounded by the lining epithelia of the
metacoel. The different coelothelia rest on the connective
tissue matrix that is crossed by numerous haemal spaces
and lacunae. Primary and secondary body cavities can be
distinguished at the ultrastructural level by their lining [13]: a primary body cavity is lined by extracellular matrix
(ECM), whereas a secondary body cavity is lined by an
epithelium consisting of basal lamina and epithelial cells.
In echinoderms, the primary body cavities form the haemal system, whereas the secondary body cavities develop
to constitute the coelom and are thus also termed coelomic cavities. Historically, the secondary body cavities
found in echinoderms have been termed axocoel (protocoel), hydrocoel (mesocoel), and somatocoel (metacoel)
[4].
The axial complex of sea urchins (Echinoidea) is part of
this tripartite coelomic system. In its most basic form, the
axial complex lies vertically within the oral-aboral axis –
hence the term "axial complex" – of interradius CD (interambulacrum 2) and is surrounded by the oral and aboral
somatocoel. It consists of derivatives of axocoel and
hydrocoel. During ontogenesis, these two cavities have
different fates: while the right hydrocoel degenerates, the
left hydrocoel gains connection to the left axocoel via the
stone canal. During further ontogenesis, the left hydrocoel
becomes the ring canal that gives rise to the radial canals
of the ambulacral (or water vascular) system, and the
stone canal connects the ring canal with the madreporic
ampulla. The latter is connected to the exterior by a
number of small ductules, the madreporic pore canals.
These canals penetrate the madreporic plate, their distal
regions being lined by an ectodermally derived epithelium, the epidermis. As in sea stars (Asteroidea), the lining
of the proximal madreporic pore canal sections is of mesodermal origin [5], since madreporic ampulla and axial
coelom ontogenetically originate from the left larval axocoel.
The axial coelom is an orally oriented part of the axocoel
that partly enwraps the stone canal as well as the axial
organ (see Fig. 1 for a representative example). The axial
organ is a large space within the connective tissue matrix,
lined by epithelial cells of the coelomic cavities that surround it. It constitutes in fact a hypertrophy of the
mesenteries that attach part of the digestive tract to the calcite endoskeleton. Since the haemal structures of the axial
complex are mainly located within the dorso-ventral
mesentery, bounded by the lining of the somatocoel, the
axial organ is surrounded by the somatocoel on one side
and by the axocoel on the other. The axial organ is an integral component of the echinoid haemal system [6]. An
aboral extension of the axial organ, however, is sur-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/10

rounded by the so-called dorsal sac, a derivative of the
right larval axocoel. This aboral extension is termed the
head process and consists of a large compartment within
the connective tissue matrix between somatocoel and dorsal sac. Axial organ and head process are crossed by
numerous anastomosing haemal lacunae that aborally
join with the anal haemal ring and the genital lacunae. In
addition, the axial organ is crossed by numerous canaliculi that constitute invaginations of the axial coelom and
somatocoelomic epithelia. Adorally, the axial organ does
not end entirely blindly, but extends into the perioesophageal haemal ring either directly or through connecting haemal lacunae.
The various sub-structures forming the axial complex have
been successfully homologized in all echinoderm taxa [713]. In sea urchins – see Fig. 2 for the present view on sea
urchin phylogeny based largely on hard-part morphology
and molecular data – the morphological data obtained for
this structure are based to a large extent on findings in the
more easily accessible "regular" sea urchins such as Arbacia punctulata, Psammechinus miliaris, Sphaerechinus granularis, and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus. However, historical
[14-18], as well as more recent [19,20] studies have
revealed that the axial complex found in irregular sea
urchins differs in its gross morphology and histology from
that found in "regular" taxa. This is exemplified by the
work of Kaburek and Hilgers [20], who reported that
Schizaster canaliferus possesses a specialized axial complex
exhibiting pronounced structural changes including loss
of sub-structures. However, some descriptions of sea
urchin soft tissues [21-24] indicate that there is good reason to believe that the axial complex found in Schizaster
canaliferus might not be typical for all Irregularia. In the
more primitive irregular species Echinoneus cyclostomus, for
example, the gross morphology of the axial complex is
more similar to the "regular" type. A number of questions
therefore arise from previous studies: (i) What are the
major changes affecting the architecture of the axial complex within the Echinoidea? (ii) Can significant differences in its structure be observed also among the "regular"
species? (iii) What could have caused the drastic changes
found in some taxa? (iv) Does a better understanding of
axial complex morphology reveal information about its
function? And finally, (v) can characters be deduced from
comparative observations of the axial complex that might
be useful for phylogenetic inferences?
Using non-invasive imaging techniques that permit large
taxon sampling [24,25], we analyzed numerous species
from almost all sea urchin orders to infer the structure of
their axial complex. These data were extended employing
invasive techniques such as dissection, histology, as well
as transmission electron microscopy, and included also
findings from published studies spanning almost two centuries. The combined analysis suggests an interdependPage 2 of 31

classification of each species, the source of the data used
in the study, specimen ID where applicable, and literature
references [26-67].

Since part of the confusion regarding axial complex morphology can be attributed to the bewildering terminology
applied by different authors and in different languages to
the same anatomical entities, we also suggest a list of definitions and provide a multilingual compilation for echinoid axial complex components to facilitate further
comparative studies.

Magnetic resonance imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using
the methods described by [24]. Imaging was carried out in
Berlin, Germany and Würzburg, Germany using highfield small animal MRI scanners equipped with 7 T and
17.6 T super-conducting electromagnets. The resolution
of the datasets varied between 20 × 18 × 18 μm3 and (86
μm)3. Tables 1 &2 list the resolutions achieved for every
species analyzed by MRI. Image processing was carried out
using ImageJ 1.38w and its Volume Viewer plugin.

Current understanding of sea urchin phylogeny. The hypotheses of echinozoan and echinoid relationships are based on
multiple sources of morphological and molecular datasets (for further references see the Materials and methods section). This
tree has not been generated using a consensus or numerical technique and reflects the views and biases of the authors.
Dissection
Dissection was performed on freshly fixed as well as
museum specimens under direct observation through a
stereo-microscope equipped with a digital camera for documentation.
Histology
Histological analyses were performed on four echinoid
species: Eucidaris tribuloides, Diadema setosum, Psammechinus miliaris, and Echinocyamus pusillus. Eucidaris tribuloides
was collected at Twin Cayes, Belize in June 2002. Psammechinus miliaris and Echinocyamus pusillus were dredged
from depths of 10–50 m in the North Sea off Helgoland,
Germany in April 2005. Diadema setosum was purchased at
a tropical fish store in Berlin, Germany in May 2005. One
juvenile of Eucidaris tribuloides, one juvenile and three
adults of Diadema setosum, five adults of Psammechinus
miliaris, and three adults of Echinocyamus pusillus were
used in this study. For light microscopy, the specimens

were fixed in Bouin's fluid for 24 h, decalcified in 2%
nitric acid, dehydrated in ethanol series, methylbenzoate
and butanol, and embedded in paraplast (Kendall). Complete series of 8 μm thick sections were prepared using a
microtome (Reichert-Jung 2050 Supercut) with steel
blades (ThermoShandon Coated High Profile Disposable
Blades) and later stained using an Azan staining technique
[68]. Series of sections were digitally recorded with an
Olympus BX 2 microscope equipped with a Color View II
camera (Soft Imaging Systems).
Electron microscopy
For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), several
specimens of Psammechinus miliaris and Echinocardium cordatum were dredged from depths of 10–50 m in the North
Sea off Helgoland, Germany in April 2005. The specimens
were dissected and their axial complexes were fixed at 4°C
in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer
at pH 7.4 for 2 h. The tissue samples were washed thrice

in the same buffer, subsequently post-fixed for 1 h in 1%
OsO4 buffered in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, dehydrated in
an acetone series and embedded in Araldite. Silver interference coloured sections (75 nm) were made with a diamond knife using an ultramicrotome (LEICA UC6),
automatically stained with 2% uranyl acetate and 2% lead
citrate using a semi-automatic ultrastaining machine
(Phoenix), and observed with a transmission electron
microscope (Philips CM 120 BioTWIN). Micrographs
were made on digital imaging plates (Ditabis) and electronically processed with the software Adobe Photoshop
CS3.

Systematic classification
The systematic classification used throughout this study is
based upon results obtained by [23,69-75]. Sea cucumbers (Holothuroidea) constitute the sister taxon to sea
urchins, while Cidaroida are the most primitive taxon
within the Echinoidea and sister taxon to Euechinoidea.
The "Regularia" are a paraphyletic clade, while the Echinacea and the Irregularia each form a monophyletic taxon
(Fig. 2). "Hemiasterina" and "Paleopneustina" presumably are paraphyletic clades. Resolution at the base of the
Euechinoidea as well as for the Echinacea is still considered relatively poor [75].

Results
Definition of components of the echinoid axial complex
In its primary structure, the echinoid axial complex consists of the following components: madreporic ampulla,
dorsal sac, head process, pulsating vessel, axial coelom,
axial organ, canaliculi, haemal lacunae, and stone canal
(Fig. 1). The designations and definitions referring to
components of the echinoid axial complex as well as the

developmental origin of each structure are provided in
Table 3. A trilingual compilation of synonymous terms to
facilitate comparative studies is provided in Table 4 with
references [76-85].
Morphological findings
In this section, the results derived from our own analyses
are combined with results derived from the literature

available on the axial complex as well as its mesenterial
suspension. For a given species, these different contributions may vary considerably, and Tables 1 &2 provide a
compilation.
Cidaroida
In lateral view, the axial complex found in Cidaris cidaris
and Eucidaris metularia is almost straight and it lies directly
underneath the madreporic plate (Figs. 3A, 4). Throughout its entire course it maintains more or less the same
width, only slightly bulging in the middle. It is suspended
by the dorso-ventral and the free mesentery (Fig. 5). The
dorso-ventral mesentery is strongly developed and connects axial complex, oesophagus, and the peripharyngeal
(or lantern) coelom with the endoskeleton. The free
mesentery connects the peripharyngeal coelom with axial
complex and rectum. The axial complex is thus attached to
two mesenteries over its entire length in Cidaris cidaris and
Eucidaris metularia (Fig. 6A, B). In the juvenile specimen of
Eucidaris tribuloides, however, the free mesentery is lacking
at the level of the axial organ (Fig. 7B).

A madreporic plate is present in cidaroid species and
numerous madreporic pore canals connect the exterior
with the madreporic ampulla underneath the madreporic
plate. Below the madreporic ampulla lies the roundishelongated dorsal sac (Fig. 7A). Its epithelium is only
slightly muscularized and mainly glandular according to
[17] and [26]. However, the presence of glands at this
location seems unlikely due to the enclosed nature of the
dorsal sac.
The head process, located within the dorsal sac (Fig. 8), is
lined by myoepithelial cells. It extends adorally into the
pulsating vessel of the axial organ. The madreporic
ampulla opens adorally into the axial coelom and the
stone canal. The axial coelom is a blindly-ending cavity
that is located between stone canal and axial organ (Fig. 9)
and that extends towards Aristotle's lantern. The width of
the axial coelom does not vary much, remaining large
towards the adoral end in Cidaris cidaris [17,26]. In
Eucidaris tribuloides, the axial coelom in general is reduced
to a thin cavity (Fig. 7B). It is lined by an epithelium with
numerous podocytes. These podocytes are found to be
restricted to that side of the axial coelom in Eucidaris sp.
that borders the axial organ [27].
In all cidaroid species analyzed to date, the axial organ is
a haemal structure composed of a connective tissue matrix
filled with coelomocytes and anastomosing haemal lacunae. Canaliculi extend into its interior from the lining
somatocoelomic and axocoelomic epithelia. The axial
organ sends out a well-developed haemal lacuna towards
the perioesophageal haemal ring that is in close contact
with the ring canal. The stone canal is a tubular structure

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/10

connecting the madreporic ampulla with the ring canal.
At its adoral end, the stone canal forms several dilatations
that converge with the ring canal. Ultrastructural investigations of the stone canal of Eucidaris sp. reveal a prismatic epithelium with ciliated, myoepithelial, and
granulated cells that probably represent secretory neurons
[28].
Echinothurioida
The axial complex of echinothurioids is straight in lateral
view, located directly underneath the madreporic plate.
Schurig [30] and Sarasin & Sarasin [31] report it to be spirally winding in Phormosoma bursarium, Asthenosoma varium, Hygrosoma hoplacantha, and Sperosoma biseriatum (Fig.
4). It is suspended by two mesenteries (Fig. 5), of which
the dorso-ventral mesentery is strongly developed, connecting the axial complex, the oesophagus, and the
peripharyngeal coelom with the endoskeleton. The free
mesentery connects the axial complex with the rectum
and terminates halfway down the axial complex in Phormosoma bursarium and Asthenosoma varium [30,31] (Fig.
5).

A madreporic ampulla lies underneath the madreporic
plate and opens into the axial coelom and the stone canal.
Sarasin & Sarasin [31] report the madreporic ampulla of
Asthenosoma varium to be connected by a canal to another
small cavity lying underneath the madreporic plate. However, these structures were not reported for Phormosoma
bursarium [30], and we believe this isolated observation to
be an artefact that will not be further considered in this
analysis. The dorsal sac (Fig. 8) lies underneath the
madreporic plate and is lined by a slightly muscularized
epithelium that is mainly glandular [30,31]. However, in
analogy to cidaroids, the presence of glands at this location seems unlikely.
The head process is lined by a muscularized epithelium as
well and continues adorally in the form of the also muscularized pulsating vessel [30]. The axial coelom parallels
stone canal and axial organ (Fig. 9) and extends from the
madreporic ampulla towards the ring canal where it ends
blindly. Its width at the base is comparable to its middle
part, at least in Asthenosoma varium and Phormosoma bursarium.
The axial organ is a structure composed of a haemal tissue
mesh crossed by anastomosing haemal lacunae and canaliculi. As in Cidaroida, the stone canal forms several dilatations at its junction with the ring canal.
Pedinoida
In lateral view, the axial complex found in Caenopedina
mirabilis is extending straight from the lantern adapically
and then obliquely in its apical part (Figs. 3B, 4). While

axial complex tapers out adorally towards the ring canal.
The axial complex is attached to the dorso-ventral and the
free mesentery (Fig. 6D). The dorso-ventral mesentery is
strongly developed and connects axial complex, oesophagus, and the peripharyngeal coelom with the endoskeleton. The free mesentery connects the axial complex with
the rectum and terminates halfway down the axial complex (Fig. 5). In its lower half, it appears that the axial
complex consists only of the stone canal and the haemal
lacuna(e) that connect(s) the axial organ and the perioesophageal haemal ring. The axial organ itself seems to
be restricted to the upper half of the axial complex. It is
spindle-shaped and bulges in its middle part (Figs. 3C, 4).
Diadematidae
In lateral view, the axial complex found in Diadema setosum is extending straight down from the madreporic plate
to the ring canal. The relatively large Aristotle's lantern
found in this species (as well as in most other diadematids) squeezes the axial complex between lantern and the
apical endoskeleton (Fig. 4). The axial complex is suspended by the dorso-ventral and the free mesentery. The
former is strongly developed and connects axial complex,
oesophagus, and the peripharyngeal coelom with the

endoskeleton, while the free mesentery connects the rectum with the axial complex in its uppermost part close to
dorsal sac and head process. It is not present in the middle
and lower parts of the axial complex (Fig. 5). In the juvenile specimen of Diadema setosum, the dorso-ventral
mesentery
interconnects
peripharyngeal
coelom,
oesophagus, axial complex as well as the rectum (Fig. 7C,
D).
The madreporic plate is perforated by numerous
madreporic pore canals that connect the exterior with the
madreporic ampulla. Right underneath the madreporic
ampulla lies the dorsal sac that encloses the compact and
roundish-elongated head process. The dorsal sac extends
further adorally, paralleling axial coelom and stone canal
in its lower part (Figs. 7C, 8). The head process is more
prominent in its adapical part and is lined by a strong
myoepithelium. It sends out the pulsating vessel into the
lumen of the axial coelom in Diadema setosum and Diadema antillarum. The axial coelom is a large cavity located
between axial organ and stone canal (Fig. 8). It ends
blindly towards the adoral end of the axial complex.
The axial organ bulges in the middle part of the axial complex and shows considerable infolding into the axial coelom (Fig. 7D). The stone canal is a tubular structure that
constantly decreases in diameter on its way down towards
the ring canal. It joins the ring canal trough a number of
small canals.
Arbacioida
In lateral view, the axial complex is straight, extending
down from the madreporic plate to the ring canal [33,34]
(Fig. 4). In the vicinity of the oesophagus, the adoral part
of the axial complex tapers out and reaches the surface of
Aristotle's lantern. Its mesenterial suspension resembles
the diadematid/echinacean type (Fig. 5). The madreporic
plate is perforated by numerous madreporic pore canals.
A pulsating vessel constitutes the adoral extension of the
head process. Schematic representations of horizontal sections of the axial organ, axial coelom as well as stone canal
of Arbacia lixula and Arbacia punctulata illustrate the internal morphology of the arbacioid axial complex (Fig. 9).
The axial organ of Arbacia lixula is reported to be surrounded by a large number of haemal lacunae [35]. The
axial complex found in Stomopneustes variolaris (incerta
sedis, presumably sister taxon to Arbacioida) resembles
the arbacioid/echinoid gross morphology.
Salenioida
The axial complex found in Salenocidaris hastigera (Figs.
3D, 4) is comparable in its lateral aspect to the axial complex found in aspidodiadematids. The mesenterial suspension resembles the diadematid/echinacean type (Fig.
5).

Echinoida
The axial complex found in the Echinoida is straight in lateral view, situated slightly shifted from the oral-aboral
axis underneath the madreporic plate (Figs. 3; 4; 6E, F). At
the junction with the oesophagus, the axial complex gradually tapers out towards the ring canal. Above this junction, a conspicuous swelling is visible that is widest in its
middle part, giving the axial complex a spindle-shaped
appearance. The mesenterial suspension resembles the
diadematid/echinacean type (Figs. 5; 6E, F).

The madreporic plate is perforated by numerous
madreporic pore canals that are lined by a ciliated epithelium and that merge adorally to form the madreporic
ampulla (Fig. 8). The latter is lined by a ciliated epithelium as well. The diameter of the madreporic ampulla
becomes gradually smaller towards its adoral end and it
basally diverges into stone canal and axial coelom. The
dorsal sac lies laterally underneath the madreporic
ampulla and surrounds the globular head process (Fig. 8).
The dorsal sac is a closed cavity and is not connected to
either madreporic ampulla, stone canal or the axial coelom. Boolootian & Campbell [56], however, report a
divergent morphology of the dorsal sac in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus in which the dorsal sac communicates with
the somatocoel via a small slit and is divided into two
contractile chambers. We believe this isolated finding to
be an artefact and will not consider it any further in our
analysis.
A strong pulsating vessel is present in all echinoid species
studied so far, its ultrastructure resembling that of the
head process. The axial coelom is located in-between
stone canal and axial organ (Fig. 9), extending adorally
before ending blindly above the ring canal. The axial
organ of Echinoida is spindle-shaped in vertical section
and shows characteristic infolding, with an enlarged surface towards the axial coelom with numerous digitations
that protrude into the lumen of the latter.
The stone canal is located at the lateral edge of the axial
complex (Fig. 9). After its gradual opening at the lower
end of the madreporic ampulla, it runs down towards the
ring canal, while exhibiting a diameter that varies only
slightly and a shape that is almost circular in cross-section.
At the lower end of the axial complex, the haemal
lacuna(e) of the axial organ adorally merge(s) with the
perioesophageal haemal ring while the stone canal
directly opens into the ring canal. In numerous echinoid
species of Echinoida the stone canal was found to pulsate.
Echinoida: ultrastructural findings
In Psammechinus miliaris, a ciliated, pseudostratified monolayer lines the dorsal sac (Fig. 10A). While only some of
the peripheral lining cells are epithelio-muscle cells, those

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/10

resting on the matrix of the head process form a strong
myoepithelium (Fig. 11E). Here, the epithelio-muscle
cells contain strong, basally located bundles of myofilaments that form a regular network of rectangularly
arranged outer circular and inner longitudinal bundles
that are embedded in the voluminous matrix of the head
process. The perikarya deeply extend into the dorsal sac
lumen, which indicates that the organ was apparently
fixed during contraction. The state of contraction can be
estimated from the position of the apical adhaerens junctions between adjacent cells. Intraepithelial nerve fibre
processes were found interspersed among the lining cells,
but podocytes were never found.
The head process contains primary body cavities lined by
the matrix of the head process. Numerous cells with
homogenous cytoplasma and relatively big nuclei float
inside this cavity, and some haematocytes could be recognized by their large number of lysosomes and residual
bodies.
The axial organ begins at the level of the first curvature of
the oesophagus and is surrounded by numerous haemal
lacunae (Fig. 11B). That part of the axial organ which
bulges into the axial coelom contains numerous deep
crypts and invaginations in Psammechinus miliaris, so that
the axocoelomic surface of the axial organ is tremendously enlarged. Inside the canaliculi, the entire lumen
seems to be occupied by microvilli (Fig. 10B). Only a few
cells are found inside the lumen, most of them coelomocytes. Haemotocytes at different stages of differentiation
are present within the matrix. They contain residual bodies and lysosomes of different rank.
Numerous podocytes rest on the axial coelomic side of the
matrix (Figs. 10C, 11F). Their pedicels are bridged by electron-dense diaphragmata. Each podocyte has a single cilium with a (9 × 2)+2 axoneme that adheres to the cell
body by a basal body, short rootlets and an accessory centriole perpendicular to the basal body. A circle of 9–12
strong microvilli surrounds each cilium (Fig. 10D). Additional microvilli emanate from the surface of the perikaryon and only seldom from the pedicels. In Echinometra
sp., the podocytes within the axial coelom lining are irregularly distributed and not restricted to the side covering
the axial organ [27].
The stone canal lining in Psammechinus miliaris is a monolayered columnar epithelium (Fig. 11C). Each of these
epithelial cells bears a long cilium with a (9 × 2)+2
axomene that adheres to the cell body with a basal body
and three rootlet structures. A circle of 9–12 strong microvilli surrounds each cilium and additional smaller microvilli emanate from the cell surface. A number of glandular
cells that show a distinct polarity can be found within the

Page 20 of 31

Frontiers in Zoology 2009, 6:10

epithelium: some cells of the stone canal lining contain
large, electron-densely stained vesicles. These possible
secretory granules lie near the apex while other cellular
components are located more basally. However, degrading cells can rarely be found among the basal portions of
the lining cells, and epithelio-muscle cells, muscle cells or
podocytes were never seen to be part of the stone canal
epithelium. The somatocoel is lined by a flat epithelium
which is only slightly muscularized (Figs. 10D, 11D). The
cilia of the somatocoel epithelium show the characteristic
composition with a dense microvilli fringe surrounding
the axoneme. The epithelial cells are connected to each
other via adhaerens junctions and do not show the specializations of the dorsal sac and axial coelom lining.
Temnopleuroida
In lateral view, the axial complex found in Mespilia globulus and Salmacis bicolor is straight, extending down from
the madreporic plate to the ring canal (Fig. 4) [65]. In the
vicinity of the oesophagus, the adoral part of the axial
complex tapers out and reaches the apical surface of Aristotle's lantern. The mesenterial suspension of the axial
complex resembles the diadematid/echinacean type (Figs.
5, 6G). A schematic representation of a horizontal section
through the axial complex of Salmacis bicolor at the level of
the axial organ is shown in Fig. 8. In Genocidaris maculata,
the course of the axial complex is slightly oblique (Fig.
3G).
Irregularia
Most obviously, irregular sea urchin species are distinguished from animals belonging to "regular" orders by
their secondarily developed bilateral symmetry. However,
their analysis demonstrates that the shape of the axial
complex is primarily not dependent on features of the
endoskeleton, but is influenced by the architecture of several internal organs as detailed below.
Holectypoida
The axial complex found in Echinoneus cyclostomus extends
from the madreporic plate down to the ring canal in an
almost straight line (Figs. 3H, 4). The madreporic plate
can be seen bulging slightly into the interior of the animal. In the upper fourth of the axial complex, a conspicuous swelling can be seen, which is interpreted as the axial
organ [22]. Close to the ring canal, the lower fourth of the
axial complex shows a swollen region which has been
seen with MRI but has also been described by [22]. Unfortunately, histological data are currently not available for
this taxon.

The mesenterial suspension of the axial complex resembles the aspidodiadematid type (Fig. 5). The dorso-ventral
mesentery extends between oesophagus, axial complex,
gastric caecum, pentagonal apical membrane (or aboral

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/10

sinus), and the endoskeleton (Figs. 5, 6H). At the apical
pole this mesentery joins the pentagonal apical membrane which forms the connection between the gonoducts
and the axial complex. This membrane appears to be
present in all irregular sea urchin taxa [8]. A second
mesentery suspends the axial complex towards the rectum
and also forms part of the pentagonal apical membrane.
The gastric caecum is not in close contact with the axial
complex (Fig. 5).
"Cassiduloida"
The axial complex found in Cassidulus caribearum and
Echinolampas depressa extends from the madreporic plate
down to the ring canal. It is bent anteriorly towards ambulacrum III (Figs. 3I, J; 4). Jensen [23] has reported similar
findings for Apatopygus recens. The madreporic plate can
be seen bulging only slightly into the interior of the animal. In the upper third, a conspicuous swelling of the
axial complex can be seen which is interpreted as the axial
organ. During its entire path, the axial complex is attached
to the dorso-ventral mesentery. This structure extends
between oesophagus, axial complex, gastric caecum, pentagonal apical membrane and the endoskeleton (Fig. 5). A
second, smaller mesentery suspends the axial complex
towards rectum and aboral endoskeleton as well as the
pentagonal apical membrane. The gastric caecum of Cassidulus caribearum and Echinolampas depressa is reduced to
numerous smaller sacs that are located further anteriorly
[24] and that are therefore not in close contact with the
axial complex. In Cassidulus caribearum, a slightly swollen
region can be seen in the adoral part of the axial complex
(Fig. 3I). Unfortunately, histological data are currently not
available for this taxon.
Clypeasteroida
Due to the flattened aspect of clypeasteroids (sea biscuits
and sand dollars), the axial complex is considerably miniaturized. It is located underneath the madreporic plate
and has a straight (Fig. 4) to bean-shaped form in lateral
view. The madreporic plate is perforated by numerous
madreporic pore canals that connect the madreporic
ampulla to the exterior. In Echinocyamus pusillus (and all
other taxa of the Fibulariidae), the madreporic ampulla is
in contact with the exterior via a single canal, the hydropore (sensu Mortensen [86]). Except for a small lateral
process, the madreporic ampulla is almost tubular so that
hydropore and madreporic ampulla seem to be merely an
aboral elongation of stone canal and axial coelom in this
species. All other clypeasteroids studied so far possess a
genuine madreporic plate and a prominent madreporic
ampulla, and their axial complex is attached to a single
mesentery during its entire course, the dorso-ventral
mesentery (Fig. 5). In its upper part, it fuses with the pentagonal membrane at the apical pole. According to
Cuénot [66], clypeasteroid species possess a strongly

developed dorsal sac that surrounds the muscularized
head process (Figs. 7G, 8). Furthermore, Cuénot [48]
reports that the dorsal sac of Echinodiscus bisperforatus
communicates with the somatocoel via a small slit. Such
a connection could not be found in Echinocyamus pusillus.
At least in the latter species, a pulsating vessel could not
be detected (Figs. 7H, 9).

The axial coelom originates from the madreporic ampulla
directly underneath the madreporic plate. The axial organ
can be found to be straight (Echinocyamus pusillus) or
bean-shaped (Echinarachnius parma, Mellita quinquesperforata) in lateral view (Fig. 3K). The stone canal's diameter
continuously decreases before passing into the ring canal
in Echinocyamus pusillus. In the few clypeasteroid taxa that

Page 23 of 31
(page number not for citation purposes)

Frontiers in Zoology 2009, 6:10

possess a gastric caecum, this highly reduced structure is
not in close contact with the axial complex.
Holasteroida
In lateral view, the axial complex found in Holasteroida is
C-shaped and extends between madreporic plate and ring
canal (Fig. 4). In its upper half, the axial complex runs parallel to the aboral endoskeleton towards interambulacrum 5. The madreporic plate is slightly infolded. The
conspicuous swelling right underneath the madreporic
plate, interpreted as the axial organ, is in an horizontal
position. In its middle section, the previously horizontally
oriented axial complex bends towards the mouth, comes
into close contact with the oesophagus adorally, and leads
in a straight line down towards the ring canal. Another
swelling can be observed in its lower third, at least in Urechinus naresianus (Fig. 4). Unfortunately, no histological
data are currently available for this taxon.

The axial complex is held in place by the dorso-ventral
mesentery that attaches digestive tract, axial complex, gastric caecum, and pentagonal membrane to the calcite
endoskeleton. Between gastric caecum and axial complex,
this mesentery is very thin, so that both structures are in
close contact with each other in the aboral part of the animals. A second, smaller mesentery connects the axial complex with rectum, pentagonal apical membrane and
endoskeleton. The mesenterial strand that interconnects
the first loop of the digestive tract is extending half-ways
along the gut loop (Fig. 5). Mortensen [21] describes the
gross morphology of the axial complex in four holasteroid
species: Echinosigra paradoxa, Pourtalesia jeffreysi, Pourtalesia wandeli, and Urechinus naresianus. The axial complexes found in Antrechinus nordenskjoldi and Pourtalesia
hispida closely resemble this description. The large gastric
caecum is in close contact with the upper part of the axial
complex (Fig. 5).
"Hemiasterina"
The axial complex found in Hemiaster expergitus closely
resembles the holasteroid and paleopneustine axial complex in its gross morphology.
"Paleopneustina"
In lateral view, the axial complex found in Abatus cavernosus and Schizaster canaliferus is C- to L-shaped and extends
down from the madreporic plate to the ring canal close to
the mouth (Fig. 4). The following description is based on
Schizaster canaliferus [20]. The madreporic plate is characterized by two calcareous ridges protruding into the interior of the endoskeleton. The axial complex is attached to
the right ridge from where it is extending towards interambulacrum 5. It then bends down towards the mouth and
extends along the gastric caecum and later the oesophagus
before finally reaching the ring canal. It is primarily sus-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/10

pended by the dorso-ventral mesentery that attaches
digestive tract, axial complex, gastric caecum, and pentagonal apical membrane to the calcite endoskeleton.
Between gastric caecum and axial complex this mesentery
is very thin, so that both structures are in close contact in
the aboral part of the specimen (Fig. 5). A second, smaller
mesentery attaches the axial complex to rectum, pentagonal apical membrane and endoskeleton.
The madreporic ampulla is reduced to several broadened
madreporic pore canals inside the right calcareous ridge,
and according to Kaburek & Hilgers [20], the dorsal sac as
well as a pulsating vessel are not present in Schizaster
canaliferus. However, the structure of the head process
resembles that in the "regular" species (Fig. 8). The axial
organ is located directly behind the right calcareous ridge
and is oriented horizontally, parallel to the endoskeleton.
A large uniform axial coelom is not present. The stone
canal is tri-partite: its upper part bears a tall-prismatic epithelium, its middle region is muscularized and filled with
coelomocytes, while its lower part close to the ring canal
is lined by a flat epithelium and is only slightly filled with
coelomocytes. The stone canal of Schizaster canaliferus is
not dilated at its junction with the ring canal and at least
its muscularized middle part can pulsate. The mesenterial
strand that interconnects the first loops of the digestive
tract is extending half-ways along the first gut loop (Fig. 5,
bottom line). The large gastric caecum is in close contact
with the upper part of the axial complex (Fig. 5).
Micrasterina
A lateral view reveals that the micrasterine axial complex
is roughly S-shaped. Its gross morphology is largely similar in the micrasterine taxa studied so far (Table 2). The
madreporic plate protrudes into the interior by two calcareous ridges comparable to the paleopneustine species
Schizaster canaliferus. Lodged in-between these two ridges
and successively emanating from the right ridge, the axial
complex is oriented horizontally in its first small part.
During its later course, it is closely associated with the
large gastric caecum passing along anteriorly towards
ambulacrum III. At the junction of the gastric caecum with
the oesophagus, the axial complex bends backwards
towards interambulacrum 5 before finally moving again
anteriorly towards the ring canal that encircles the mouth
(Figs. 4, 5). The micrasterine axial complex is primarily
suspended by the dorso-ventral mesentery that attaches
digestive tract, axial complex, gastric caecum, and pentagonal membrane to the calcite endoskeleton (Fig. 5).
Between gastric caecum and axial complex, this mesentery
is very thin, so that both structures are in close contact in
the aboral part of the specimens. A second, smaller
mesentery suspends the axial complex towards pentagonal apical membrane, rectum, and aboral endoskeleton.
The mesenterial strand that interconnects the first loops of

Page 24 of 31
(page number not for citation purposes)

Frontiers in Zoology 2009, 6:10

the digestive tract is extending far towards ambulacrum
III, "dragging" the axial complex along (Fig. 5).
The madreporic plate is perforated by a small number of
horizontal and vertical madreporic pore canals [16,18].
Underneath and within the right calcareous ridge, a small
madreporic ampulla can be seen. Parallel to this structure,
a dorsal sac can be found at least in Echinocardium mediterraneum, Heterobrissus niasicus, and Spatangus purpureus [1618]. It contains the head process (Fig. 8), which is not pulsatile in Heterobrissus niasicus according to Wagner [18].
The head process extends further posteriorly into the axial
organ. A pulsating vessel was found in several micrasterine species. Parallel to axial organ and stone canal, the
axial coelom extends adorally from the inconspicuous
madreporic ampulla.
The gross morphology of the stone canal is known for a
number of micrasterine taxa and closely resembles the
architecture in Schizaster canaliferus. It can be sub-divided
into three parts: the first part is in close association with
the axial organ and ends at the adoral end of the latter.
Here, the stone canal transforms into a canal composed of
a mesh-like tissue that is filled with "pigment" [16]. It
continues in this state parallel to the gastric caecum and
the haemal lacunae until reaching the vicinity of the
oesophagus where it transforms again to become a hollow
canal covered by a thin epithelium. Schurig [30] states
that the water vascular and the haemal systems in Heterobrissus niasicus are always clearly separated, the haemal
lacuna running parallel to the stone canal before reaching
the perioesophageal haemal ring.
Micrasterina: ultrastructural findings
In Echinocardium cordatum, the axial coelom is lined by flat
epithelial cells, each of which bears a single cilium. The
ciliary axoneme shows the typical (9 × 2)+2-pattern and is
attached to the basal body. Two ciliary rootlets and a basal
foot anchor the cilium to the cell. Both ciliary rootlets are
co-axial, running obliquely to the main axis of the basal
body. Some fibrillar material secures the connection of
the accessory centriole to the longer vertical rootlet and
fixes its position underneath the basal foot. The cilia are
encircled by a dense fringe of 9–12 strong microvilli (Fig.
10E). Numerous podocytes line the axial coelom and the
lumina of the canaliculi inside the axial organ (Fig. 11F).
The canaliculi are filled with a huge number of microvilli
and cilia that project into their lumen, resulting in a tremendous surface extension (Fig. 10F). Epithelio-muscle
cells can be detected sporadically, and sometimes even
podocytes seem to bear muscle fibers.

The axial organ consists of a dense matrix and is rich in
canaliculi and lacunae (Fig. 9). It is characterized by cells
with electron-bright cytoplasm and by the distinct lacunar

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/10

system. Local increments of the matrix constitute haemal
lacunae filled with haemal fluid. A basal lamina demarcates the border of the tissue towards the coelomic epithelium of the axial coelom. Connective tissue cells and an
enormous number of phagocytotic cells can be found in
the inner parts of the axial organ. The haematocytes are
filled with residual bodies as well as lysosomes of different rank. Collagenous and elastic fibers as well as free cells
constitute the major part of the axial organ. The somatocoelomic lining is a flat, only slightly muscularized epithelium (Fig. 11D), consisting of a monociliated
monolayer overlying the basal lamina of the axial organ.
No podocytes could be detected in the somatocoelomic
epithelium.

Discussion
Whereas an extensive comparative study of the axial complex had been undertaken in the sister taxon to Echinoidea, the Holothuroidea [11], such a comparative
approach has not yet been applied to the study of the echinoid axial complex. One objective of this study was therefore to obtain an insight into the overall anatomy of the
axial complex within a wide selection of sea urchin species. Many of these species can be obtained only with great
difficulty as viable specimens, and several others are available only as fixed specimens from museum collections,
often precluding their use for dissection, histology or electron microscopy. To partially circumvent these problems,
we additionally employed a non-invasive imaging technique (MRI) in conjunction with a thorough review of the
relevant literature dating back to the pioneering studies of
F. Tiedemann that were published at the beginning of the
19th century [44]. This complementary approach did not
allow an analysis of all examined echinoid species with all
procedures, but nevertheless permitted to gather results
from a representative number of sea urchin species regarding the architecture of the axial complex, thereby forming
the basis for an in-depth comparison. To avoid, as much
as possible, repetitions with data presented in the Results
section, we will attempt to concentrate here on (i) major
changes in axial complex architecture, (ii) the possible
reasons for these changes, and (iii) the axial complex'
potential function as derived from morphological features. Finally, (iv) we address the question whether phylogenetically informative characters can be deduced from
comparative observations of the axial complex. It must be
borne in mind, however, that the present compilation is
far from complete and rests, in a number of orders, on the
analysis of only a few or even single species and specimens.
Major changes in the architecture of the axial complex
and its constituent parts
The gross morphology of the axial complex in the analyzed sea urchin taxa varies considerably, although major

Page 25 of 31
(page number not for citation purposes)

Frontiers in Zoology 2009, 6:10

structural changes are restricted to the more derived irregular species (Fig. 4). However, the form of the axial complex may depend on a number of factors, such as the age
or health of the specimen. Furthermore, since the stone
canal fuses with the ring canal set atop Aristotle's lantern
in the "regular" and clypeasteroid taxa, movement of this
feeding apparatus may alter the form of the axial complex
considerably. In the Atelostomata, the axial complex is
running parallel to the endoskeleton in its upper part
before bending down adorally to run along the gastric caecum towards oesophagus and ring canal. This can be considered the most derived condition. Other irregular sea
urchin taxa such as the Holectypoida, "Cassiduloida" and
Clypeasteroida have obviously preserved the more plesiomorphic state, exhibiting an axial complex that is comparable in its gross morphology to the condition observed in
Aspidodiadematidae or Diadematidae, the "regular" taxa
presumably most closely associated with the ancestor of
Irregularia (Fig. 2).
In most species analyzed here, the madreporic plate (Figs.
1, 4) is situated medially on the aboral side and is perforated by numerous madreporic pore canals. However,
Echinocyamus pusillus does not have a madreporic plate,
and its axocoel is connected to the exterior via a single
pore (or sometimes several pores). Mortensen [86]
describes the reduction of the madreporic pore canals as
characteristic for the Fibulariidae, a small group within
the Clypeasteroida that exhibit strong paedomorphic
traits, and the reduction of madreporic pore canals has
been considered a highly derived feature within the
Clypeasteroida [87].
All examined "regular" species possess a prominent
madreporic ampulla (Figs. 1, 4), while the madreporic
ampulla is reduced to a system of broadened madreporic
pore canals in the spatangoid sea urchins as shown by
[20] for Schizaster canaliferus. Whether the ampulla-like
cavity underneath the madreporic plate that was described
by Koehler [15] and Hamann [16] in Spatangus purpureus
can be referred to as a madreporic ampulla must currently
be regarded as unclear.
A prominent, in cross-section C-shaped dorsal sac (Figs. 1,
4, 11) is partially enveloping the head process in most
species. According to [20], this structure is reduced in
Schizaster canaliferus. Hamann [16] and Wagner [18],
however, presented drawings of the dorsal sac and head
process in Echinocardium mediterraneum and Heterobrissus
niasicus, which, together with the comparison of the axial
complex architecture in several spatangoid taxa presented
here, leads us to assume that a misapprehension of its
composition may have led Kaburek & Hilgers [20] to consider that the dorsal sac is missing in Schizaster canaliferus.
However, we hypothesize that size and form of dorsal sac

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/10

and head process may be dependent on the sexual maturity of the specimen, since, at least in Asteroidea, the dorsal sac-head process complex was shown to serve the
gonads as a local heart [88].
The axial coelom of all species studied ends blindly at the
adoral end of the axial organ (Figs. 1, 11). The axial coelom, like dorsal sac and madreporic ampulla, shows a
similar structural pattern within the "regular" sea urchin
species as well as the clypeasteroid species examined so
far, although it must be noted that species of Atelostomata
appear again to display a differing condition (see, e.g.
[20]).
Rather unclear is the situation regarding the pulsating vessel (Fig. 9). Cidaroid, echinothurioid, diadematoid, arbacioid, echinoid, as well as temnopleuroid species have
been reported to possess a truly pulsating structure within
the axial coelom that constitutes an adoral extension of
the muscularized head process. Such pulsations have not
been reported for any irregular taxon, although histological sections of the upper axial coelom of spatangoid species reveal a separate haemal lacuna overlying the axial
organ that we homologize with the pulsating vessel found
in the "regular" taxa. Whether this structure actually pulsates cannot currently be stated with confidence.
The axial organ is present in all echinoid species observed
so far and constitutes an integral component of the sea
urchin haemal system both in "regular" and irregular taxa
(Figs. 1, 7, 11). Its internal structure is comparable in all
taxa, its dense connective tissue matrix being crossed by
numerous anastomosing haemal lacunae and canaliculi.
The stone canal (Figs. 1, 7, 8, 9, 11) is in fact that substructure of the axial complex undergoing the most drastic
changes during evolution: in spatangoid species it is
divided into three distinctive parts, its upper part closely
resembling the stone canal found in "regular" taxa. At the
adoral end of the axial organ it transforms to become a
chambered structure filled with numerous coelomocytes.
This part of the stone canal is additionally surrounded by
smooth muscle fibers and might therefore pulsate. The
lower part is again unchambered, but is also filled with
coelomocytes. Kaburek & Hilgers [20] believe that the
stone canal in Schizaster canaliferus may assume functions
of the axial organ. This, however, would imply a mixing of
different body fluids at this location which we believe to
be highly unlikely.
The columnar epithelium of the stone canal is a distinctive feature in comparison to the flat epithelia of axial coelom and somatocoel (Fig. 11). The interior of the stone
canal is filled with numerous cilia that cause an active and
directed transport of coelomic fluid [28,54,59]. Another

Frontiers in Zoology 2009, 6:10

difference to the other coelomic cavities can be seen in the
presence of glandular cells, which Rehkämper & Welsch
[28] consider to be neuro-secretory cells. Neither muscular tissue or podocytes within nor contractions by the
stone canal could be observed by us in "regular" or irregular sea urchins.
In conclusion, it can be stated that presumably all sea
urchin taxa possess an axial complex as part of their haemal system. The axial complexes found in all "regular"
species are comparable to a large degree, consisting of a
straight to slightly oblique structure located in interradius
CD extending vertically down from the madreporic plate
to the ring canal. In the irregular sea urchin species an evolutionary trend towards miniaturization and horizontal
alignment of the axial organ in conjunction with a bending of the axial complex as a whole (Fig. 4) can be
observed. However, despite these drastic changes in axial
complex gross morphology, its internal composition has
largely remained unchanged, so that the plesiomorphic
Cidaroida share numerous similarities with the highly
derived Atelostomata.
Reasons underlying the observed changes in axial complex
architecture
The mesenterial suspension of the axial complex and of
the digestive tract components is straightforward in the
"regular" taxa: Cidaroida possess an axial complex supported by two mesenteries, of which the free mesentery is
successively reduced in the other "regular" taxa (Fig. 5).
The situation observed in the juvenile specimen of
Eucidaris tribuloides, where only the dorso-ventral mesentery is suspending the axial complex in its middle part
(Fig. 7B), might hint at a similar development within
Cidaroida or might be due to the early developmental
stage of the specimen. In Psammechinus miliaris, both
mesenteries seem to be reduced completely in the lower
middle and lower part of the axial complex [45, this
study], hinting at an even further reduction of mesenterial
structures in some taxa within the Echinoida. The
mesenteric suspension of the axial complex in the more
primitive Irregularia can be described as largely comparable to the condition observed in Aspidodiadematidae and
Diadematidae. Whether the smaller mesentery suspending the axial complex towards the rectum can be considered homologous with the respective structure in
"regular" sea urchins cannot currently be answered with
certainty. Notable is the absence of this mesentery in the
Clypeasteroida, a condition that presumably can be
ascribed to the laterally displaced position of the rectum.
In the Atelostomata, the dorso-ventral mesentery fuses
with the large mesenterial strand that interconnects the
coils of the first loop of the digestive tract (Fig. 5). However, the precise mesenterial suspension of irregular sea
urchins on the whole as well as the homologies of the

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/10

respective mesenterial structures remain unclear and
merit further investigation.
The assumption that a reorganization of the morphology
of the axial complex occurred along with the evolution of
bilateral symmetry can therefore be ruled out. Rather, the
present results suggest a gradual co-evolution of various
internal organs within the Irregularia based on their structural interdependence. The reasons underlying this development can be seen in the altered lifestyles of irregular sea
urchins based on their conquering of infaunal habitats
and a parallel change in feeding strategies. These changes
apparently correspond to the gradual enlargement of the
gastric caecum, a structure that constitutes an outgrowth
of the proximal stomach, which is thought to be of importance in the digestive process [19]. However, due to its
topography, the gastric caecum is suspended by the dorsoventral mesentery as well. Its successive growth inevitably
had to lead to a rearrangement of the gross morphology of
the axial complex. Since the gastric caecum is most prominent in the Atelostomata, its effect on the structure of the
axial complex and the dorso-ventral mesentery should
also be most evident here, which is precisely what is
observed (Figs. 4, 5). An additional change in digestive
tract anatomy is responsible for another highly derived
condition seen in Micrasterina: here, the mesentery suspending the first coil of the digestive tract has expanded
and moved in anterior direction towards ambulacrum III,
"dragging" the axial complex along, and ultimately leading to the more or less S-shaped form observed in this
group of animals (Figs. 4, 5).
Another aspect of importance for the changes in axial
complex gross morphology can be seen in the relative
position of the apical system of the endoskeleton that
accommodates also the madreporic plate. In the Holasteroida, the apical system is located further anteriorly than in
other irregular taxa, which, in combination with the posteriorly orientated gastric caecum, brings about a prolonged and horizontally aligned axial complex in the
apical region (Figs. 4, 5).
Function of the echinoid axial complex
In terms of function, the sea urchin axial complex remains
as enigmatic as ever, especially so, since these marine
invertebrates have been shown to survive its removal for
several months [36,49,89], although some specimens do
show rapid regeneration of the removed structures [36],
suggestive of a beneficial function of this structure for the
animal. Historically, a number of functions have been
attributed to the echinoid axial complex, including that of
a gill [90], an immune organ (e.g. [35,37,91,92]), a gland
(e.g. [7,15,46,57,93]), an embryonal organ without function in the adult [94], a coelomocyte and cell production
site (e.g. [16,17,66,89,95]), a cell degradation site (e.g.

Frontiers in Zoology 2009, 6:10

[45,60]), a swelling of the water vascular system [14], and
a heart (e.g. [40,44,55,56,96-99]). Furthermore, a number
of authors have advocated a predominantly excretory role
of the axial complex (e.g. [16,17,31,46,100,101]). This
hypothesis is supported by recent studies that homologize
the left larval axocoel (protocoel) that can be found
throughout the "lower" deuterostome taxa (e.g.
[13,102,103]). In this context, the finding of podocytes –
highly specialized cells that permit selective fluid transfer
– in coelomic compartments of the axial complex is indicative of an excretory function [27].
One aim of our study concerned the possible presence of
podocytes in the Irregularia to support the excretion
hypothesis as well as to shed light on other functions that
have been ascribed to the echinoid axial complex. Since
epithelio-muscle cells are found lining the axial coelom in
addition to podocytes, their contraction could generate a
pressure gradient that allows filtration of the haemal fluid
into the axocoel, but it remains unsolved on the basis of
the available data whether the ultrafiltrate constitutes primary urine in terms of a metanephridial system [104].
However, the presence of structures as highly specialized
as podocytes leads us to assume that the axial organ at the
junction of haemal and coelomic compartments primarily acts as an excretory structure.
The epithelium of the dorsal sac consists of a strong pseudostratified myoepithelium in the vicinity of the head
process in Psammechinus miliaris. At least in the "regular"
sea urchins ultrastructurally examined so far (Table 1),
this can be stated as the common situation. The presence
of axons inside the dorsal sac lining of asteroids [105]
clearly supports the assumption that the myoepithelial
lining of the dorsal sac is a contractile component of the
axial complex. Based on the "local heart-hypothesis" postulated for Asteroida by Warnau & Jangoux [88], we
hypothesize that the echinoid dorsal sac may serve to spatially separate the contractions of the head process from
the neighbouring body cavities. The fact that no podocytes were found lining the dorsal sac is in support of its
complete disconnection from other coelomic cavities and
the exterior.
The inner composition of the head process with its free
cells and elastic fibers resembles that of the axial organ,
allowing for the haemal fluid to pass unhindered. The distinct muscularization of the surrounding epithelium as
well as the even macroscopically visible contractions in
some species (e.g. [35,47,49,55,61] corroborate the axial
organ's function as a local contractile organ. Since the haemal spaces inside the head process are directly connected
to the gonadal haemal lacunae, the head process might
serve to supply the aborally located gonads with nutrients.
If so, enlargement of the digestive tract and reduction of

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/6/1/10

the number of gonads should be accompanied by the
reduction of haemal supply lacunae. This can in fact be
observed in Spatangoida [19]. The remarkable amplification of the axial organ surface by involution (Fig. 11)
clearly supports the assumption that substances in solution are being absorbed by large areas of the axial organ.
This situation leads us to assume that components of all
body fluids (haemal fluid and coelomic fluid) might
interact inside the axial organ. In addition, the large
number of haematocytes in the axial organ points to a
removal of corpuscular wastes, such as foreign cells (e.g.
bacteria) and cellular remnants of the animal itself. As the
genomic analysis of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus has
revealed the presence of many immune system-related
genes [106], it would clearly be interesting whether these
loci exhibit a particularly pronounced expression within
components of the axial complex.
Phylogenetic implications
Based on the comparative morphological results, a
number of characters can be inferred that are phylogenetically informative. However, since we believe all axial
complex sub-structures (Table 3) to be present in all echinoid orders, no informative characters can be deduced
from the presence or absence of these.

The overall form of the axial complex shape in lateral view
differs considerably in sea urchin taxa and ranges from a
straight aspect to a largely S-shaped form in the derived
Micrasterina. A further character that can be used with
confidence is the orientation of the axial organ, being vertically oriented in most taxa and horizontally oriented in
the Atelostomata only. The mesenteric suspension of the
axial complex differs among the observed taxa and clearcut changes are observed between "regular" and irregular
taxa. In both groups a successive reduction of the free
mesentery can be observed (Fig. 5), in the Clypeasteroida
this suspension is entirely absent. The mesenteric suspension in Micrasterina further distinguishes this taxon from
other Atelostomata with its enlarged mesenteric strand
interconnecting the coils of the first gut loop.
A character for which extensive data are available is the
composition of the stone canal. In the Atelostomata, the
stone canal is tri-partite whereas all "regular" taxa
observed so far possess a uniform stone canal. However,
the conspicuous swelling observed in the oral part of the
stone canal in Echinoneus cyclostomus and some "Cassiduloida" might hint at a sub-divided stone canal in these
taxa as well. Here, more extensive histological examination is required. A further character involving the stone
canal is its connection to the ring canal which is dilated in
the basal echinoid taxa. Echinacea have presumably
developed a single connection. However, the condition is
not known in several basal "regular" (e.g. Pedinoida, Aspi-

Frontiers in Zoology 2009, 6:10

dodiadematidae) and irregular taxa (e.g. Holectypoida,
"Cassiduloida") as well as in the outgroup, Holothuroidea. Another character for which no sufficient data are
available is the interesting aspect of the diverging distributional pattern of podocytes in Cidaroida and Echinoida
[27]. To shed light on this phenomenon, extensive
ultrastructural analyses are required.
In order to assess whether the above mentioned characters
will lead to an extension of the morphological character
matrix and thus to a refined echinoid phylogeny, a cladistic analysis based on these and further soft tissue characters is currently in preparation by members of our group.
It remains to be determined whether the comparative
analysis of further echinoid organs, such as the gut and its
various appendages, will result in the recognition of additional features whose architecture is dependent on each
other within the Echinoidea.

Our findings reveal a structural interdependence of various internal organs, including digestive tract, mesenteries,
and the axial complex within the Echinoidea. The present
study further demonstrates that the type of approach
employed here, i.e. to combine all available data on a
given organ across a large number of taxa, long in use for
hard-part anatomical structures, can be applied to internal
organs as well and is very powerful in elucidating interdependent anatomical relationships that are not obvious
when the analysis is carried out only with a few species.
