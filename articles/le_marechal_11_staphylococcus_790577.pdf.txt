Abstract
Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of mastitis in ruminants. In ewe mastitis, symptoms range from subclinical
to gangrenous mastitis. S. aureus factors or host-factors contributing to the different outcomes are not completely
elucidated. In this study, experimental mastitis was induced on primiparous ewes using two S. aureus strains,
isolated from gangrenous (strain O11) or subclinical (strain O46) mastitis. Strains induced drastically distinct clinical
symptoms when tested in ewe and mice experimental mastitis. Notably, they reproduced mild (O46) or severe
(O11) mastitis in ewes. Ewe sera were used to identify staphylococcal immunoreactive proteins commonly or
differentially produced during infections of variable severity and to define core and accessory seroproteomes. Such
SERological Proteome Analysis (SERPA) allowed the identification of 89 immunoreactive proteins, of which only 52
(58.4%) were previously identified as immunogenic proteins in other staphylococcal infections. Among the 89
proteins identified, 74 appear to constitute the core seroproteome. Among the 15 remaining proteins defining the
accessory seroproteome, 12 were specific for strain O11, 3 were specific for O46. Distribution of one protein
specific for each mastitis severity was investigated in ten other strains isolated from subclinical or clinical mastitis.
We report here for the first time the identification of staphylococcal immunogenic proteins common or specific to
S. aureus strains responsible for mild or severe mastitis. These findings open avenues in S. aureus mastitis studies as
some of these proteins, expressed in vivo, are likely to account for the success of S. aureus as a pathogen of the
ruminant mammary gland.
Introduction
Mastitis is the first cause of economical loss in milk
production worldwide [1] and is a major concern in
milk transformation [2]. The problem is however currently hard to tackle for mastitis in dairy cows, sheep
and goats. Especially, S. aureus mastitis is typically
refractory to antibiotic treatment. Prophylactic measures, including the development of an effective vaccine,
have so far proven unsuccessful for the control of the
disease. S. aureus is well-known to produce a large variety of virulence factors (including numerous proteins
like toxins or adhesins). Consequently, it induces a large
panel of infections, and the clinical acuteness of each
infection type may also be variable. For example,

S. aureus mastitis in dairy sheep ranges from subclinical
mastitis to lethal gangrenous mastitis. Such variability
relies on staphylococcal virulence factors as well as host
factors. Until now, no study has been performed
to identify the transcripts and proteins commonly or
specifically produced in vivo by S. aureus strains during
mastitis. To obtain such information using direct transcriptomic or proteomic approaches upon S. aureus
samples collected within the infection site stumbles
on technical bottlenecks such as the low amounts of
S. aureus cells and the difficulty to localize the infection
site within the udder.
Serological proteome analysis (SERPA) is a promising
technique that can be used to shed light on the host’s
immune response to staphylococcal infection. This technique was used to mine new antigen candidates for vaccine development in human infections [3]. SERPA has
also been used to identify proteins produced in vivo,

during infection [4]. In combination with whole genome
shotgun sequencing, SERPA is a powerful tool to identify immunoreactive proteins produced by S. aureus during the infection [5].
Genotyping studies indicated that S. aureus strains
isolated from dairy sheep farms in the south east of
France were clonally related and are predominantly
represented by a single pulse-field gel electrophoresis
(PFGE) type OV/OV’ [6,7]. Such close phylogenetic relationship was recently confirmed at the global scale using
Multi Locus Sequence Typing and comparative genome
hybridization [8,9]. Among strains in this OV/OV’ PFGE
profile, one was isolated from subclinical mastitis (O46)
and another one from gangrenous mastitis (O11). Few
genetic differences were identified [10] and their role in
the development of mastitis with such different severity
has not yet been determined. Moreover identification of
the proteins produced by S. aureus in mastitis with different severity is an important step to better understand
the host-pathogen interactions and to provide targets
for the development of efficient prevention or treatment
strategies against mastitis. Therefore, we applied SERPA
to identify proteins that are produced by both S. aureus
strains O11 and O46 (core seroproteome) and the ones
specifically produced by each strain (“accessory”
seroproteome).

Genome sequencing of O11 and O46 strains

To facilitate the analysis of SERPA results, the genome of
the two strains used in experimental infection was fully
sequenced using the Solexa technology (P Mayer, L Farinelli, and E Kawashima, 1997. Patent application WO98/
44151) according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, genomic DNA was
physically fragmented by nebulization into 50- to 500-bp
fragments. After end repair and ligation of the bar-coded
paired-end adaptors, the products were purified on agarose gel to recover products with inserts of ~200 bp.
Quality control was performed by cloning an aliquot of
the library into a TOPO plasmid and capillary sequencing eight clones per library. The samples were then used
to generate DNA colonies using one channel of a pairedend flow cell at dilutions of 4 pM. The flow cell was then
submitted to 2 × 74 cycles of sequencing on the genome
analyzer. Base calling was performed using the GAPipeline 1.4.0 software; a total of 27.6 million reads (pass filter) were obtained. After bar code selection, 13.9 and
11.8 million reads of 71 bases in length were obtained for
the strains O11 and O46 respectively. The pool of
sequences obtained was analyzed and assembled using
the Edena assembler [13], which resulted in a set of 87
and 96 contigs for O11 and O46, respectively. The gene
content of each strain (2787 and 2822 Coding Sequences
-CDSs- for O11 and O46, respectively) was thus established and used in protein identification after SERPA.
Detailed genome analysis of these strains is described
elsewhere (Le Maréchal et al., submitted).

lineage found associated to ewe mastitis in south east of
France [6,7]. Growth conditions and preparation of protein extracts were as described in Le Maréchal et al. 2009
[11]. Briefly, overnight cultures in BHI were diluted
1:1000 in fresh RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). RPMI was extemporaneously
depleted of iron (and hereafter referred to as irondepleted RPMI) by adding deferoxamine (0.15 mM)
(Sigma). Growth conditions in which there is restriction
in the bioavailability of iron can indeed lead to an
increase of the expression of virulence factors which are
normally expressed in vivo [12]. S. aureus strains were
grown in 500 mL flasks under agitation (150 rpm) at
37 °C (a flask-to-broth volumetric ratio of 5), for aerobic
conditions, or in falcon tubes (50 mL) completely filled
with medium and incubated at 37 °C without agitation
for anaerobic conditions. Protein samples for supernatant, cell wall or total fraction were prepared exactly as
previously described [11].

*: O11 and O46 were used for experimental infections and their genome was
fully sequenced (see Materials and Methods).

2-Dimensional Electrophoresis (2-DE)

Samples (200 μg of proteins for Coomassie blue staining
and 50 μg for Western blotting) were precipitated with 2D

clean up kit (GE Healthcare, Orsay, France) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Pellets were solubilised in
sample solution containing 7 M urea, 2 M thio-urea,
25 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 4% (w/v) 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane-sulfonate (CHAPS)
and 2% (w/v) ampholyte containing buffer (IPG-Buffer 4-7
or 3-10 NL, GE Healthcare). Isoelectric focusing was carried out using pH 4 to 7 (Cell wall and total proteins) or 3
to 10 NL (exoproteins) 13 cm Immobiline Dry Strips on a
Multiphor II electrophoresis system (Amersham Biosciences; GE Healthcare, Orsay, France) for a total of 60
kVh using a standard procedure described previously [14].
The second dimensional separation was performed on the
Ettan™ DALTtwelve electrophoresis system (GE Healthcare) using 14% acrylamide separating gels without a
stacking gel at a voltage of 50 V for 1 h and 180 V for
about 7 h. Kaleidoscope Prestained Standards (Biorad)
were used as standard. Gels were transferred onto membrane or stained with R250 Coomassie blue (Serva, Heildelberg, Germany) or MS-compatible silver nitrate
(Sigma) [15].
Intramammary challenge with S. aureus in ewes

Experimental mastitis was performed according to the
Regional Committee for Animal Use and Care (Côte
d’Azur, France) and is recorded under reference NCA/
2008-14/12-09. Healthy lactating primiparous ewes of
Lacaune breeds were selected based on the absence of
intramammary infections and milk somatic cell counts
below 100 000 cells/mL. Repeated full bacteriological
analysis of milk from the two quarters that were going
to be infected showed that the ewes were negative for
Staphylococcus sp. and Mycoplasma sp. Absence of
nasal carriage for staphylococci was also checked after
enrichment and culturing of swab samples of the nares
of ewes on selective media, as described previously [6].
At D0, 12 ewes were divided into 2 groups and urethral
catheters (Portex ® Jackson Cat Catheter, Coveto,
France) were inserted into the teat canal after a thorough disinfection of the teat orifice with 70% ethanol.
1 mL PBS containing 20 CFU of S. aureus (O11 or
O46) was injected through the catheter, which was
removed afterwards. Six ewes were thus infected by
strain O11 (group O11) and six by strain O46 (group
O46). Severity of the mastitis induced in ewes was estimated according to criteria presented in Additional file
1, Table S1. Mastitis was classified as subclinical, clinical, pyogenic and gangrenous. Classification was based
on clinical symptoms, presence of S. aureus cells and
Somatic Cell Count (SCC) in milk.

D0, D7, D14, D21 and D28 post inoculation (pi). Briefly,
blood samples were kept for 2 h at room temperature
before centrifugation. Sera were then stored at -20°C.
Milk samples were taken 24 and 36 h pi for bacteriological examination and determination of SCC. Milk was
1/10 diluted and 100 μL of this dilution was plated on
selective Rabbit Plasma Fibrinogen Baird-Parker medium
to confirm S. aureus presence in the mammary gland.
SCC was measured with the Fossomatic method [16] to
follow the onset of the infection.
Western blot analysis

Total cell lysates were prepared as previously described
[11]. Total protein extracts of S. aureus strains O11 and
O46 were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% acrylamide
separating slab gels (70 × 100 × 0.5 mm), with a 4% acrylamide stacking gel on a mini-protean III gel system
(BioRad, Ivry sur Seine, France) according to Laemmli
[17]. Protein migration was performed for 2 h at room
temperature at constant 80 V voltage. Samples were
diluted in sample buffer and denatured at 100 °C for
3 min. Gels were transferred onto a PVDF membrane
(GE Healthcare) at constant 250 mA amperage in Towbin transfer buffer [18] using a Trans-Blot cell (Biorad)
for 1.25 h. Membranes were washed three times with
Tris Buffered Saline (TBS) at pH 7.5 and saturated in
blocking solution (3% non-fat dry milk in TBS with 0.3%
Tween 20 (TBS-T)) at 4 °C overnight. After saturation in
blocking solution, membranes were washed 3 × 10 min
with TBS-T and exposed to the different ewe sera used
as primary antibody for 4 h at room temperature. After
washing, membranes were incubated with alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-sheep IgG (Sigma) diluted
1:15,000 in 25 mL blocking solution for 1 h and finally
BCIP/NBT (Sigma) was used to visualize immunoreactive
proteins, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Selection of the hyper-immune sera

Sera samples were analysed by western blotting as
described above. Sera sampled on D0, D7, D14, D21 and
D28 pi were compared using the mini-protean II Multiscreen apparatus (Biorad) (600 μL of serum diluted
1:10,000 in blocking solution). Immunostained Western
blots were scanned using an Image Scanner II (Amersham
biosciences) and further analyzed using Image- Quant 1D
software. The number, volume and area of bands were
taken into account for the analysis. Optimal dilution for
the selected sera was determined as described above. Sera
and dilutions yielding the best ratio signal/background
were selected.

Sample processing

Identification of immunoreactive proteins

Sera from ewes were prepared from blood samples collected aseptically from the jugular vein of the animals at

Bacterial proteins separated by 2-DE were transferred
onto a PVDF membrane (GE Healthcare) as described

above. Series of four gels were migrated and treated in
parallel. Three gels were used for immunoblotting, and
the fourth one was Coomassie blue-stained for spot
matching and further identification. After saturation in
blocking solution the membranes were treated with
selected sera in blocking solution during 4 h. Then, the
membranes were washed with TBS-T and incubated
with alkaline phosphatase conjugated anti-sheep IgG
(Sigma) diluted 1:15 000 in 25 mL blocking solution for
1 h. Finally BCIP/NBT (Sigma) was used to visualize
immunoreactive proteins, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Membranes were scanned using an
Image Scanner II (Amersham biosciences) and further
analyzed using Image- Master 2D software. Immunoblot
profiles for 2-DE-separated proteins were reproducible
in at least two individual experiments. Images of the 2D
electrophoresis gels and the BCIP-NBT treated membranes were compared to detect immunoreactive proteins. Spots that were absent or had a significantly
different intensity in one strain were considered as proteins that differed between O11 and O46. Spots corresponding to proteins of interest were excised and
identified using Nano-Liquid Chromatography (NanoLC) MS/MS analysis.
Nano-LC MS/MS analysis

Proteins were identified by tandem mass spectrometry
(MS/MS) after an in-gel trypsin digestion adapted from
Shevchenko [19]. Briefly, gel pieces were excised from
the gel, washed with acetonitrile and ammonium bicarbonate solution, and then dried under vacuum in a
SpeedVac concentrator (SVC100H-200; Savant, Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). In-gel trypsin
digestion was performed overnight at 37 °C and stopped
with spectrophotometric-grade trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA) (Sigma-Aldrich). The supernatants containing
peptides were then vacuum dried in a Speed-Vac concentrator and stored at -20 °C until mass spectrometry
analysis. Nano-LC experiments were performed using an
on-line liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) setup using a Dionex U3000-RSLC nanoLC system fitted to a QSTAR XL (MDS SCIEX, Ontario,
Canada) equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source
(ESI) (Proxeon Biosystems A/S, Odense, Denmark).
Samples were first concentrated on a PepMap 100
reverse-phase column (C18, 5 μm, 300-μm inner diameter (i.d.) by 5 mm length) (Dionex, Amsterdam, The
Netherlands). Peptides were separated on a reversephase PepMap column (C18, 3 μm, 75 μm i.d. by 150
mm length) (Dionex) at 35 °C, using solvent A (2% (vol/
vol) acetonitrile, 0.08% (vol/vol) formic acid, and 0.01%
(vol/vol) TFA in deionized water) and solvent B (95%
(vol/vol) acetonitrile, 0.08% (vol/vol) formic acid, and
0.01% (vol/vol) TFA in deionized water). A linear

Page 4 of 20

gradient from 10 to 50% of solvent B in 40 min was
applied for the elution at a flow rate of 0.3 μL/min.
Eluted peptides were directly electrosprayed into the
mass spectrometer operated in positive mode. A full
continuous MS scan was carried out followed by three
data-dependent MS/MS scans. Spectra were collected in
the selected mass range 400 to 2 000 m/z for MS and
60 to 2 000 m/z for MS/MS spectra. The three most
intense ions from the MS scan were selected individually
for collision-induced dissociation (1+ to 4+ charged ions
were considered for the MS/MS analysis). The mass
spectrometer was operated in data-dependent mode
automatically switching between MS and MS/MS acquisition using Analyst QS 1.1 software. The instrument
was calibrated by multipoint calibration using fragment
ions that resulted from the collision-induced decomposition of a peptide from b-casein, b-CN (193-209). The
proteins present in the samples were identified from MS
and MS/MS data by using MASCOT v.2.2 software for
search into two concatenated databases: (i) a homemade
database containing all the predicted proteins of the S.
aureus strains O11 and O46 used in this study and (ii) a
portion of the UniProtKB database corresponding to the
S. aureus taxonomic group [20]. Search parameters were
set as follows. A trypsin enzyme cleavage was used, the
peptide mass tolerance was set to 0.2 Da for both MS
and MS/MS spectra, and two variable modifications
(oxidation of methionine and deamidation of asparagine
and glutamine residues) were selected. For each protein
identified in NanoLC-ESI-MS/MS, a minimum of four
peptides with MASCOT score corresponding to a P
value below 0.05 or an Exponentially Modified Protein
Abundance Index [21] greater than 0.4 were necessary
for validation with a high degree of confidence. For
automatic validation of the peptides from MASCOT
search results, the 1.19.2 version of the IRMa software
was used [22].
Intramammary infection with S. aureus in mice

The animal study was conducted according to current
Good Scientific Practice-principles (2000) and approved
by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Veterinary
Medicine, Ghent University (Belgium). Sixteen CD-1
lactating female mice (Harlan Laboratories Inc., Horst,
The Netherlands) were used 12-14 days after birth of
the offspring. The pups were removed 1 to 2 h before
bacterial inoculation of mammary glands and a mixture
of ketamine/xylazine was used for anesthesia of the lactating mice. The orifice of both L4 (on the left) and R4
(on the right) abdominal mammary glands was exposed
by a small cut at the near end of the teat. 100 μL PBS
without (n = 2) or with 150 CFU of S. aureus strain
O11 (n = 7) or O46 (n = 7) was injected slowly with a
32-gauge blunt needle through the teat canal. Rectal

Le Maréchal et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:35
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/35

body temperature of the mice was measured at 0 h and
18 h pi. At 18 h pi mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine to collect blood by cardiac puncture and
serum was obtained after clotting at 37 °C and cold centrifugation. After cardiac puncture, mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and mammary glands were
isolated. Glands of six mice of each group were homogenated and bacterial CFU was quantified by plating
serial logarithmic dilutions in PBS. Lysates from the
homogenates were prepared in 1% NP40-based buffer.
Serum and mammary gland lysates were quantified for
IL-1b, IL-6, TNF, KC and MCP-1 using BD ™ Cytometric Bead Array technology. Mammary glands (inoculated and PBS control glands) of 4 mice (2 from each
group) were embedded and used for further histopathological analysis (Vetopath, Antibes, France).
Statistical analyses

A Fisher test was used with a risk a = 10% to determine
the difference between the ewes infected with S. aureus
O11 and the ewes infected with strain O46. Differences
in rectal body temperature and cytokine levels in the
mouse mastitis model were analyzed with the unpaired
T-test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
Ewes infected with O11 or O46 S. aureus strains
developed mastitis with different severities

Although O11 and O46 strains share the same genotype
and are highly genetically similar [10], they were isolated
from dramatically different ewe mastitis episodes. One
can thus wonder whether the clinical signs associated
with O11 and O46 infection were or not related to
strains characteristics or a fortuitous matter of sampling
time (mastitis can indeed evolve from subclinical to
severe clinical or even gangrenous within a few days).
To check this, two groups of ewes were infected either
with O11 or O46 S. aureus strains, as described in the
previous section. Onset of the symptoms was followed
up during the course of the experiment. All animals
became infected and signs of mastitis were evident in
most ewes as soon as 24 h pi. The animals shed the
S. aureus strains over the sampling period and remained
infected for the duration of the experiment. Shedding
from the infected glands varied and S. aureus load in
milk ranged from 10 CFU/mL to 3.16 × 108 CFU/mL,
depending on the individual ewe, and on the day pi (not
shown). Symptoms evoked by intramammary inoculation varied among ewes. In group O11, five out of six
ewes developed a gangrenous mastitis, the last one
developed a pyogenic mastitis according the criteria
defined in Additional file 1, Table S1. In group O46,
symptoms were more heterogeneous and mastitis cases
were classified in subclinical mastitis (n = 1), pyogenic

Page 5 of 20

mastitis (n = 2), mild clinical mastitis (n = 2) and gangrenous mastitis (n = 1). Subclinical mastitis was determined with the presence of bacteria (250 CFU/mL of
milk 36 h pi), a raise in SCC (> 200 000 cells/mL in
each milk sample after 24 h) and absence of fever or
symptoms. Except for the ewe with subclinical mastitis,
bacteria were detected in all milk samples and reached
more than 106 CFU/mL 36 h pi. All animals had fever
(above 40 °C 36 h pi) and SCC increased quickly and
was above 10 6 cells/mL at 36 h pi. The proportion of
the gangrenous mastitis was significantly higher in the
group of ewes infected with O11 strain compared to the
group infected with O46 (p = 0.08) (Additional file 2,
Figure S1).
S. aureus O11 and O46 induce dramatically different
clinical features in infected mice. To confirm our observation that S. aureus strains O11 or O46 induce different types of mastitis, the mouse mastitis model was
employed in the current study. Strains O11 and O46
grew equally well in the infected mouse mammary
glands and induced mastitis, as determined by temperature measurement (hypothermia in O11 group and
hyperthermia in O46 group, 24 h pi; Additional file 3,
Figure S2) and histopathological analysis: polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) infiltration was observed
only in infected (either with O11 or O46 strains) mammary gland tissue (not shown). To analyse the role of
each strain in the development of mastitis, cytokine profile of the serum and mammary gland tissue lysates of
mice infected with O11 strain was compared to those
infected with O46 strain. The results of cytokine quantification showed that mice infected with S. aureus O46
had significantly higher IL-1b and TNF levels in the
mammary gland lysates and significantly higher systemic
(serum) levels of IL-1b and MCP-1 (Additional files 4
and 5, Figures S3 and S4). Altogether, these results
demonstrate that despite their close genetic relationships, S. aureus O11 and O46 reproducibly induced
mastitis with significantly different clinical signs.
Antibody production in response to infection of ewes
with S. aureus strains O11 or O46

To compare the relative level of antibodies developed in
response to S. aureus presence in the mammary gland,
serum sampled on D0, D7, D14, D21 and D28 pi were
analysed by Western blotting using either O46 or O11
total bacterial extracts as described in the previous section. The number of bacterial proteins recognised by
sera and signal intensity increased from D0 to D28 for
both O11 and O46 samples (Figure 1). The intensity of
the signal revealed with sera collected on D0 was low
and much weaker compared to those obtained with sera
collected on D21 or D28. Western blots membranes
were analysed as described in the previous section. Sera

Le Maréchal et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:35
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/35

collected either on D21 or D28 were selected for further
analysis. Sera yielding the best signals in each group
(one sample for each of the six ewes) were pooled to be
used in SERPA experiments. Two pools were thus
obtained: sera from ewes infected with O11 and sera
from ewes infected by O46, hereafter referred to as
group O11 sera and group O46 sera, respectively.
Detection and identification of immunogenic
staphylococcal proteins by SERPA

Protein samples were prepared from O11 and O46
strains grown in conditions that best mimic the mastitis
context [11]. Each fraction (total, cell wall and supernatant) of O11 and O46 culture was immunoblotted using
either group O11 or group O46 sera. Altogether, 89 proteins were identified as immunoreactive (Table 2). Comparison of SERPA results (see Figure 2, and Additional
files 6 and 7, Figures S5 and S6) on the three fractions
analyzed showed that immunoreactive proteins were
mainly identified in supernatant samples prepared from
aerobic and anaerobic cultures (Figure 2 and Additional
file 7, Figure S6) and cell wall samples (Additional file 6,
Figure S5, upper panels) whereas total protein samples
were poorly recognized (Additional file 6, Figure S5,
lower panels). A vast majority of the immunoreactive

cell, submitted to 1-DE, western blotted on PVDF membrane and

infected in each group. One representative example is given for
each group of infected ewes (with O11 or O46).

proteins are thus found in supernatant and cell wall fractions (88.7%), and only 11.3% are found in the total fractions (Figure 3A). Of note, secreted and surface proteins
are expected to be exposed to the host immune system.
The predicted location of the proteins (according to the
SurfG+ analysis of O11 and O46 genome sequences)
[23], showed that the immunoreactive proteins were
mainly predicted cytoplasmic (52.8%) (Figure 3A). Proteins were classified into categories based on functional
annotation (Figure 3B). Most immunogenic proteins
identified here are found in various functional categories
involved in cellular machinery and metabolism; while
20% were virulence factors and virulence associated
proteins.
Composition of the core and accessory seroproteomes

SERPA revealed 74 proteins as being recognised by both
group O11 and group O46 sera (Table 2). These proteins
defined the core seroproteome, i.e. a pool of staphylococcal proteins that are recognized by the host immune system in both S. aureus strains (Figure 3C). Moreover, 15
proteins were differentially recognized by group O11 sera
or by group O46 sera. These proteins defined the accessory seroproteome, i.e. a pool of strain-specific proteins
that are recognized by the host immune system. Among
these 15 proteins, 12 appeared to be immunogenic only in
infections with O11 (Table 2). These proteins include 7
virulence-associated proteins (Sbi, SspB, SspA, Aur, IsdH,
Opp1A, and VWbp), 2 stress response proteins (AhpF,
TrxB), 1 hypothetical protein (product of CDS O11_0736
or O46_1969 in O11 or O46), Ldh and a cysteine synthase.
Of note, when considering the corresponding genes, all of
these 12 genes are present and highly similar in O11 and
O46 strains. Only ahpF and vwbp present 2 and 1 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (NS-SNPs),
respectively. These results suggest that O11 produce these
12 proteins in vivo in a mastitis context whereas O46 does
not, or to a much lesser extent. Three proteins appeared
to be immunoreactive with group O46 sera only. Two of
them are hypothetical proteins corresponding to
SAOV0649 (CDS 011_2290 and 046_0078, in O11 and
O46, respectively) encoding a probable esterase or lipase,
and a gene 011_0490/046_2740 with no homology in
ED133 genome sequence. The third protein is IsaA, a virulence-associated immunodominant antigen A. The genes
encoding IsaA and the probable esterase or lipase are
highly homologous in O11 and O46 with only 1 synonymous SNP found when comparing O11_2290 and
O46_0078. Interestingly, the CDS O11-0490 in O11 genome shares homology with O46_2740 in O46. However,
sequence analysis reveals that O11-0490 corresponds to a
truncated form of O46_2740. This gene encodes a predicted protein that presents 59% identity and 76% homology with exfoliative toxin D [24].

Figure 2 Representative 2-DE gels and SERPA on supernatant fractions of S. aureus O11 (A) and S. aureus O46 (B). Supernatant samples
were prepared from stationary phase cultures of S. aureus strains grown anaerobically on iron-depleted RPMI. Preparative 2-DE gels were
Coomassie blue stained (left panel). Gels run in parallel were immunoblotted using the pools of sera obtained from group 1 (infected with O11)
animals (middle panels) or from group 2 (infected with O46) animals (right panels). Samples were run in parallel on 13 cm gels (pI 3-10; 14%
SDS-PAGE). Spots identified by MS/MS are labeled.

Selected S. aureus immunoreactive proteins are widely
distributed among a panel of strains isolated from clinical
vs. subclinical ewe mastitis

In order to test the hypothesis that the seroproteomic
variations identified by SERPA on the two S. aureus isolates were more widely distributed among isolates of a
specific host- and clinical-association, we screened an
additional 10 strains isolated from subclinical (n = 5)
and severe (i.e. clinical or gangrenous mastitis; n = 5)
cases of ewe mastitis for the presence of 2 selected proteins by proteome analysis of supernatant samples (i.e.
2-DE and Coomassie blue staining). The O11 (severe
mastitis) protein selected was SspB, which belongs to a
proteolytic cascade where a metalloprotease aureolysin
(Aur) activates a serine protease zymogen proSspA,
which in turn activates the SspB cysteine protease [25].
SspB and the two other proteins, SspA and Aur of the
cascade, were recognized in O11 and yielded a very faint
signal in O46 (Figure 4A). SspB, one element of this

proteolytic cascade, was detected in the culture supernatant of strains isolated from clinical mastitis cases
whereas it was not found in the strains isolated from
subclinical mastitis (Figure 5A). The other protein tested
was O46_2740 gene product (with similarity to exfoliative toxin family), which was specifically recognized in
O46 infections and did not yield any significant signal in
O11 infections (Figure 4B). When considering its presence in the culture supernatant of other S. aureus
strains isolated from clinical or subclinical mastitis
in ewes, we observed that it was only detected in the
subclinical strains (100%) whereas it was undetectable
in any of the strains isolated from clinical mastitis
(Figure 5B). These results show that at least these tested
proteins are differentially produced by S. aureus strains
isolated from clinical or subclinical mastitis cases.
Whether these differences are involved or not in the
onset and the acuteness of the subclinical vs. clinical
mastitis remains to be demonstrated.

Discussion
Two closely related S. aureus ovine strains reproducibly
induce distinct mastitis types in ewe and mouse models.
Contrarily to Escherichia coli mastitis, which severity is
mainly determined by host factors and not by the strains
features [26], it seems that in S. aureus, inter-strain variations exist in terms of virulence potential. Such variations have been experimentally observed but the
involved staphylococcal factors have not been clearly
identified yet [27-29]. S. aureus content in virulence factors reportedly varies from strain to strain and this may
account for the large panel of symptoms encountered in
ruminant mastitis [30]. It was also shown that some elements of the core genome could account for host adaptation in S. aureus ruminant isolates [8]. Here, we show
that two closely related S. aureus strains are able to
induce dramatically different mastitis outcomes in animal model. The experimental mastitis induced in ewes
confirmed that strain O11, originally isolated from a
gangrenous mastitis, induced more severe infections
than strain O46 in ewes. To corroborate the finding of
the diversity of the clinical signs caused by O11 and
O46, the mouse model of mastitis was employed for
further investigation [31]. Despite variable susceptibility
to viral, fungal or bacterial infections among the different mouse lines [32], the mouse model was validated as
an experimental approach to the study of bovine mastitis [33]. In this study, CD-1 mice infected with O11 or
O46 revealed diverse clinical signs and showed different
cytokine profiles: O46 induced higher IL-1b and TNF-a

levels in the mammary gland lysates and higher serum
levels of IL-1b and MCP-1. It has been shown that the
cytokines play a pivotal role in the development of the
mastitis [34-36]. Recent investigation revealed that the
proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-a and IL-1b, increased
the capacity of bovine endothelial cells to eliminate
intracellular S. aureus [37]. Endothelial cells may so
represent a functional and active defence barrier against
bacteria invasion of infected quarters. Higher synthesis
of proinflammatory cytokines in O46-infected mice
might thus reflect a higher anti-staphylococcal response
and may allow more effective elimination of strain O46.
Further investigation has to be conducted to confirm
this hypothesis. Altogether, our findings demonstrated
that these two well-characterized strains reproducibly
induce drastically different mastitis in terms of severity,
and will prove useful tools to gain further insights into
host-pathogen interactions.
Inventory of mastitis-associated core and accessory
seroproteomes in S. aureus reveals new mastitis-related
antigens

This study reports the application of SERPA to determine the core and accessory seroproteomes resulting
from experimental ewe mastitis induced by two different
S. aureus strains, isolated from a subclinical mastitis
(O46) and a gangrenous mastitis (O11). To determine
which proteins are recognized by the ewe immune system during mastitis with different severity, experimental
infections were carried out on primiparous ewes using

Le Maréchal et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:35
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/35

these two S. aureus strains. By comparison of the
SERPA profiles, this study allowed, for the first time, the
determination of core and accessory seroproteomes for
S. aureus in a mastitis context. Eighty nine proteins
were immunogenic in ewe mastitis implying they were
produced during the infection. Seventy four were found
in both seroproteome profiles and composed a core seroproteome. Fifteen of them were found strain-specific
and composed the accessory seroproteome. Among the
74 proteins belonging to the core seroproteome, only 44
(59.5%) had already been reported to be immunogenic
in infections caused by S. aureus or other pathogens
(e.g. Bacillus anthracis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Clostridium perfringens, Schistosoma japonicum) (Table 2).
Among these previously described antigens, only 30S
ribosomal S1 and LukM/LukF’-PV were previously
reported to be immunogenic in S. aureus bovine mastitis
[38,39]. These 44 proteins include most of the immunoreactive proteins categorized in Toxins-Haemolysins and
Virulence/Defence mechanisms. The remaining 30 proteins (40.5%) are described for the first time as potential
staphylococcal antigens in a mastitis context and, to our
knowledge, were not described as immunogenic elsewhere. In the accessory seroproteome, 8 out the 15 proteins identified were already described as immunogenic
elsewhere whereas 7 of them (AhpF, Opp1A, VVbp,
Mqo, cysteine synthase and two hypothetical proteins)
are described as such for the first time (Table 2). A
majority of the proteins identified here are thus reported
as immunogenic for the first time in a mastitis context.
Furthermore, 37 out of 89 proteins of the total seroproteome (~42%) correspond to proteins described as staphylococcal antigens for the first time whatever the
infection considered. Only four of these new antigens are
categorized in Toxins-Haemolysins and Virulence/
defense mechanisms. The other ones are mostly found in
Metabolism (n = 9), Information storage (n = 7), and
Unknown function (n = 13). Only a few studies previously analyzed S. aureus proteome and all of them were
carried out on human isolates, which reportedly differ
from ruminant isolates [8,9,40] and the strains were
grown in laboratory culture conditions [4,41-46]. Here
we used two ovine isolates grown in culture conditions
mimicking the mastitis context [11]. These two criteria
might account for the abundance of new staphylococcal
antigens identified in this study.
Importance of secreted and exported proteins in
seroproteomic patterns

It is commonly assumed that surface exposed proteins
play a role in host-pathogen interactions and that,
because of their cellular localization, they are preferentially recognized by the host immune system. In this
study, immunoreactive proteins were mainly identified

Page 15 of 20

in protein samples prepared from supernatant and cell
wall fractions revealing, somehow, discrepancies
between experimental (gels of total, cell wall and supernatant protein fractions) and theoretical localization (as
determined in silico). Indeed, among the 47 immunoreactive proteins that were predicted cytoplasmic, only
10 were experimentally found in the total fraction and
37 were found in supernatant or cell wall fractions
(Table 2). Such discrepancies were observed in other
studies as well [4,47,48]. Some proteins are multifunctional and found both intra- and extracellularly. For
example, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
[49] and enolase [50] were shown to be both cytoplasmic and surface exposed. In addition to their metabolic
role in the cytoplasm, they play a role as adhesins when
exposed on the bacterial surface. Furthermore, a new
mechanism of protein exportation in Gram positive bacteria was recently described and not included yet in prediction tools for protein localization. It has actually been
demonstrated that S. aureus, like some Gram negative
bacteria, secretes membrane vesicles, which contained at
least 90 different proteins [51]. Twelve of the proteins
identified here were found in the vesicle-secreted proteins identified by Lee et al. [51]. Whether the other
immunoreactive proteins identified here are secreted
through a membrane vesicle mechanism remains
undetermined.
The core seroproteome

Proteins belonging to the core seroproteome are immunogenic regardless the severity of the induced mastitis.
These proteins are therefore good targets for the development of new strategies against S. aureus mastitis.
Some of them have been tested as vaccine target to prevent staphylococcal infections e.g., Enolase (Eno) [52],
IsdA (an iron-regulated cell wall-anchored protein) and
IsdB (a cell surface transferrin-binding protein) [53,54],
GapC/B protein (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) [55], Hla (alpha-hemolysin) [56]. These vaccines
seem at least to limit infection damage (by notably
decreasing mortality) but not to provide total effective
protection.
Well-known virulence factors, such as Hla, Hlb (betahemolysin), SspA (V8 serine protease), ScpA (Staphopain
A), and Plc (phosphatidylinositol phosphodiesterase),
were identified here in a mastitis context and were previously identified as immunogenic in human infections
[4,57]. Hla and leukotoxins were reportedly produced in
vivo during mastitis [58] but to our knowledge this is the
first time that the other proteins listed in Table 2 are
shown to be produced in vivo during mastitis. These proteins deserve more attention to test their role in the mastitis onset and to check their potential use as target for
vaccine development. Of note, we found 5 iron-related

Le Maréchal et al. Veterinary Research 2011, 42:35
http://www.veterinaryresearch.org/content/42/1/35

proteins (IsdA, IsdB, IsdH, MntC and SirA, 4 of which
belonged to the core seroproteome) consistent with the
culture conditions (iron depletion) and with a role in the
physiologically important and difficult iron uptake in the
mastitis conditions.
The accessory seroproteome

Some proteins were shown to be specifically produced
by strain O11 or by strain O46 in infected ewes. None
of 12 proteins specifically produced by O11 in vivo had
previously been reported as produced during mastitis.
Their role in mastitis is thus unknown. Nevertheless
most of them have been described as immunogenic in
S. aureus infections in humans. Their function is mainly
linked to resistance to host immune response like for
IsdH [59], AhpF and TrxB, implied in oxidative stress
responses [60] that may confer O11 resistance to neutrophils and so be an advantage compared to O46, Sbi
that forms complexes with immunoglobulins Fc regions
[61], Aur and SspB. Aureolysin is essential for activation
of SspA [25], which in turn activates the SspB zymogen
[62]. Aur, SspA and SspB seemed to be more produced
in O11 than in O46. They can degrade conjunctive tissue [63]. Aureolysin has been shown to be involved in
resistance to macrophage phagocytosis [64] and to significantly contribute to the activation of the fibrinolytic
system [65]. It might thus reinforce the degradation of
extracellular matrix in the mammary gland and promote
bacterial spread and invasion. SspB can activate the chemoattractant chemerin, which results in a local inflammation of the tissue [66]. Moreover it induces the
depletion of functional phagocytes at the site of infection by blocking phagocytosis by neutrophils and inhibiting their chemotactic activity [67]. SspB may so take
part in the observed swelling of the mammary gland
observed during gangrenous mastitis. Moreover, it has
been shown that SspA and SspB play an important role
in virulence in a mouse abscess model [68]. Opp1A was
found to be produced by strain O11 in vivo. Opp proteins seem to take part in virulence in several infection
models [69]. Although the role of Opp has not been
clearly demonstrated until now, Opp proteins have also
been reported to be involved in virulence in other Gram
positive pathogens such as group A streptococci [70],
Streptococcus agalactiae [71] or Listeria monocytogenes
[72]. A variant of von Willebrand factor-binding protein
gene has recently been located on the pathogenicity
island SaPIov2, characteristic of small ruminant isolates
[9]. Interestingly, besides being a coagulase, it is also an
activator of pro-thrombin [73] that is present in cow
milk [74]. Pro-thrombin activation in thrombin may
have a pro-inflammatory effect during mastitis and thus
take part in the symptoms observed in animals infected
by O11. Whether and how these proteins are involved

Page 16 of 20

in the acuteness of the disease induced by O11 remains
unknown. O46 specifically produced 3 immunoreactive
proteins when compared to O11. IsaA has been
reported to be immunogenic in many S. aureus infections [3,52,57,75-77]. It presents autolytic activity and is
necessary for complete virulence [78] but its role in
mastitis is not known. Interestingly, a protein (encoded
by O46-2740) which shows similarity to exfoliative toxin
D (ETD) was found produced by O46 and not by O11.
Three amino-acids were shown to constitute the active
site common to all the exfoliative toxins [79]. These
amino-acids are present in O46_2740 gene (O46 strain)
product but one is missing in O11-0490 gene product.
The corresponding gene is not found in the recently
released sequence of ovine strain ED133 [9] although we
found its product in the exoproteome of 5 additional
S. aureus strains isolated from subclinical mastitis. ETD
is associated with cutaneous abscesses and furuncles
[80]. Interestingly this toxin is also produced by Coagulase Negative Staphylococci species like Staphylococcus
hyicus, Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and Staphylococcus chromogenes. CNS are highly prevalent in ovine
subclinical mastitis [81]. Whether this particular toxin is
specifically produced and plays a role during subclinical
mastitis remains to be tested. Altogether, proteins differentially produced by O11 and O46 may be considered as
potential marker of gangrenous or subclinical mastitis
but this has still to be further demonstrated.

Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the
first comparative and comprehensive serological proteome analysis in a mastitis context. The proteins identified are immunogenic in ewes implying that they are
also produced in the udder during infection. Many of
them are found immunogenic for the first time and a
great proportion was found in the supernatant and cell
wall fractions even though they were predicted as cytoplasmic proteins. Whether or how these proteins are
really involved in the mastitis infection and or the severity of the mastitis remains to be elucidated. This study
provides a handful of interesting candidates for further
investigations on their potential use as new targets for
prophylactic or curative strategies such as vaccine or
drug target as some appear to be involved in important
virulence-associated functions (toxins, immune evasion,
iron uptake).
