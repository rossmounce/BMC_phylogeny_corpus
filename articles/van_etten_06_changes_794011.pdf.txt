Abstract
Small-scale studies on long-term change in agricultural knowledge might uncover insights with
broader, regional implications. This article evaluates change in farmer knowledge about crop
genetic resources in highland Guatemala between 1927/37 and 2004. It concentrates on maize (Zea
mays ssp. mays L.) in one Guatemalan township, Jacaltenango, an area with much ecological and
maize diversity. It relies on a particular type of baseline information: lists of farmer-defined cultivars
drawn up by ethnographers in the first half of the twentieth century. A questionnaire format based
on two independent lists of local farmer cultivars dating from 1927 and 1937 was used to assess
changes in maize diversity. Comparisons between attributes given to each cultivar in the past and
in 2004 were used as a partial test of the stability of cultivar identity. In farmers' perceptions,
cultivar loss was low and limited to certain cultivars adapted to the warmer environments. Crop
production problems were mentioned as the main motives for change. No evidence for a loss of
cultivars due to the political violence of the 1980s was found. In the lower areas many newly
introduced cultivars were found, which reportedly provide solutions for the production problems
the older cultivars have. The article contrasts these findings with those of an earlier study which
suggested much cultivar loss due to political violence, and draws conclusions about the
methodological implications.

Introduction
The intraspecific genetic diversity of crops in farmers'
fields has increasingly received attention due to several
convergent social and academic concerns. Crop genetic
innovations for and by poor farming households have
become an important focus of food security research [1].
Attention is being paid to the role of farmers in supplying
seeds, given the limitations of seed supply by the formal
sector in poor areas [2]. Since the early 1970s, concerns
over the loss of genetic diversity as maintained in traditional agriculture ('genetic erosion') have spurred research
as well [3]. Enhancement and protection of crop diversity

has also received some international acclaim. The International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (2004) obliges the signing countries to "promote or
support, as appropriate, farmers and local communities'
efforts to manage and conserve on-farm their plant
genetic resources for food and agriculture."
Monitoring change is central to much research on crop
genetic resources. Genetic resources, like other biological
resources, are not 'stocks', but ongoing processes. They
never remain static and constant energy is spent on maintenance and innovation to secure their reproduction and

adaptation. However, long-term change in intraspecific
crop diversity is a particularly problematic research subject. To trace change, comparative methods have to be
developed, and some type of time series data should be
obtained. If change took place over a long period or in the
past, research depends on historical information sources
of a varying nature and quality.
This study uses one particular type of historical information, which is available for many areas and crops: lists of
farmer-named cultivars or crop types. The aim of the
research reported here is to bring out some important
aspects of changing farmer knowledge related to their perceptions of intraspecific diversity, which are thought to
bear on the biological dimensions of crop diversity. It will
describe a methodology for dealing with this type of information to study long-term change in farmer cultivar
knowledge. The study concentrates on maize (Zea mays
ssp. mays L.) in one township in the highlands of Guatemala where this methodology was applied.
There are several limitations which have to be taken into
account when using a comparative approach based on
farmer cultivar names. Definitive answers on questions
about the relation between cognition and biological reality might be unobtainable as biological information was
never collected in the past. In spite of the difficulties of
relating cognitive and biological categories directly, it
might be argued that approaching the issue from the side
of farmer knowledge might give a complementary perspective to the biological one. Farmers' perceptions and
knowledge might give privileged insights in the factors
that seem most relevant to farmers themselves, and the
motivations for choices in crop cultivar management.
Another limitation of this study, which derives from a
deliberate methodological choice, is spatial. It concentrated research efforts in one township, thereby limiting
itself to a small area. Another study of changes in farmer
knowledge of maize cultivar names in the same region has
taken a regional perspective [4]. This study will point out
the implications of methodological choices of spatial
extent and detail. This issue might be relevant to the development of methods in this field of study. In a field of
research in which the possibility of manipulating the context is limited, adopting a micro-scale approach might be
seen as a form of experimentation, which may produce
important new insights [5]. Fine-grained analysis may
uncover the hidden meaning of apparent anomalies by
interpreting them in the light of a larger system. Smallscale observations may also be relevant to the understanding of a larger system, when they can only be interpreted
by indicating the incoherence of the larger system that was
thought to be unified. Thus, fine-grained research on cognitive aspects of farmer diversity management might have

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2/1/12

complementary merits compared to other research
approaches. One of the aims of the present paper is to
determine what these are.

Maize diversity and cultivar naming
The present study relied on a survey about farmer knowledge and concentrated on cultivar names. It did not
employ biological specimens or photographs, unlike
some other studies in this field, and biological diversity
was not measured independently in this study area. Thus,
the meaning of farmer cultivars as the unit of analysis and
the meaning of cultivar names in relation to maize diversity needs some further discussion.
Zimmerer analyzed local changes in crop diversity in
terms of cultivars, without drawing conclusions about the
broader implications of local cultivar losses, because "
[t]he basic regional biogeography of cultivars belonging
to almost all native crops remains so inadequately understood that the overall significance of change at a local
scale cannot be estimated" [6]. (A useful and broadly
accepted definition of cultivar is "a variety, strain, or race
that has originated and persisted under cultivation or was
specifically developed for the purpose of cultivation" [7].)
Reservations about the implications of local studies on
(farmer-defined) cultivars might be justified in the case of
maize, too. To draw out possibilities to link the findings
of this study to broader scales and biological units of
diversity, a discussion of maize biogeography and the
relation between maize genetic diversity and farmer maize
classification is needed.
Research on the biogeography of maize in Mesoamerica
has mainly revealed coarse patterns of genetic diversity.
Maize was probably domesticated in Oaxaca, Mexico,
around 7000 B.C. [8]. In Guatemala, like in other parts of
the Mesoamerican region, the milpa complex (maize and
intercropped species, including different species of beans
and squashes) is central to traditional agriculture. The
western highlands of Guatemala are an area that harbours
some of the highest concentrations of maize diversity
worldwide [9,10]. Anderson made an early study of maize
in Guatemala, noting the phenotypic purity of Guatemalan maize in comparison with other areas of Latin America [11]. Wellhausen et al. described thirteen races of
maize for Guatemala, based on the morphology of the
ear, and mapped their geographical distribution in Guatemala [10]. (For a critique of the followed classification
methods, see [12].) Hanson, relying on the work of
McClintock, Kato and others, indicated that geographic
patterns in phylogeny of Guatemalan maize as revealed
by chromosome knobs corresponded to a pattern of twodimensional migration, maize being more related when it
was geographically proximate [13]. Also, increased
genetic isolation with increasing altitude was evident in

(page number not for citation purposes)

Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2006, 2:12

this analysis. Bretting et al. describe the isozymatic variation of the identified Guatemalan maize races, and found
a broad distinction between lowland and highland races
[14].
Although these investigations have examined broad patterns of maize genetic diversity in Guatemala, little is
known about genetic patterns in smaller areas. However,
ongoing investigations in Mexico might have implications
for Guatemalan maize as well. Regional maize research in
Oaxaca and Chiapas has demonstrated low marker based
differentiation values (FST) between populations (seed
lots) and communities [15-17]. These values are interpreted as evidence for considerable gene (seed) flow
between farms and communities. Besides, it is pointed
out that maize is a cross-pollinating species. Because of
crosspollination between adjacent plots, it may be difficult to maintain maize seed lots genetically 'pure' under
farmer conditions [18,19].
However, two points qualify the implications of these
findings for the present study. First, the precise implications of the cited genetic studies are not entirely clear. The
FST values from which the conclusions are drawn should
be interpreted cautiously, as the model on which they are
based does not discriminate between recurrent gene flow
and historical events, including the fragmentation of
related subpopulations [20]. The fragmentation of related
subpopulations might prove to be important, as in Mesoamerican maize pollen flow between fields and seed
mixing have most likely far less impact than seed
exchange and replacement, which is frequent and concerns larger numbers of individual plants. Also, the cited
studies do not evaluate differentiation of maize with altitude. Meanwhile, field observations suggest that Guatemalan maize populations might prove to show significant
geographical structure.
Native maize farmers in Guatemala generally try to preserve purity in observable characteristics, and are thought
to be successful in doing so [11,21]. Isolation of broad
maize types in different growing areas may contribute to
the maintenance of phenotypic and genotypic differences
in some highland communities in Guatemala [21,22].
Farmer cultivars of maize in Guatemala are often grown in
different places along an altitudinal gradient, and have
different characteristics which make their adaptation specific to these places [22-24]. Characteristics important for
farmer classification of maize diversity include the length
of the growing season, the shape of the cob, and kernel
colour and type [22,23,25-30].
The second qualifying point is that even if high levels of
gene flow and low levels of differentiation are assumed,
the observed phenotypic differences that constitute the

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2/1/12

possibility of farmer classification of cultivars might still
be meaningful. In the cited studies it has been argued that
selection of maize seed by Mexican farmers effectively
maintains phenotypic differences in ear and kernel characteristics vis-Ã -vis gene flow [15,16,31]. These phenotypic differences are important for crop production and
use. Farmers are observed to strive for maintenance of
some ideal crop type in spite of the challenges of gene
flow [31]. It has been argued that phenotypic diversity, as
an important dimension of genetic diversity, deserves
consideration in its own right, in addition to markerbased diversity [16].
Granted that phenotypically distinguished units exist in
Mesoamerican maize farming systems, the question
remains how cultivar names given by farmers relate to
biological units of diversity. It has been established that
during several decades a relatively stable classification
scheme existed in one Guatemalan highland community
[22]. Even so, it was observed in this community that
'new' seed lots introduced from outside the community
did not always receive a distinct name, but might be
included in existing local categories [also noted by [18]].
Newly introduced cultivars that received a new, distinctive
name included a cultivar suited to cultivate recently
cleared land for which other cultivars were not suited, and
a cultivar that showed to be more adapted to drought than
local cultivars. To generalize from these limited observations, it might be stated that incoming seeds will only
receive a distinctive name if they are sufficiently different
from locally present cultivars or suited to new types of
ecological (or other) use.
In any case, farmer cultivar names do not correspond to
phenotypic categories in a straightforward way, but their
meanings imply additional dimensions important in classification, including their specific use context, occurrence,
history, and origin. (This also indicates that the value of
visual aids like specimens or photographs during interviews to solve the cultivar identity issue is relative - cultivar classification does not rely on readily observable
characteristics only, but is to some degree contextual.)
In a quantitative analysis of maize in Cuzalapa (Jalisco,
Mexico), Louette found that seed lots that bore the same
cluster name grouped together morphologically [18].
Thus, in spite of the indicated complications, a sufficient
degree of association between cultivar names and genetic
diversity might be expected to justify a systematic study of
cultivar knowledge change as one source of insights into
historical change of crop diversity.

Context and baseline data
Jacaltenango is a Guatemalan township (municipio)
located in western highlands. The last census (2002)

Figure 1
Study area: township capital and eight rural communities of Jacaltenango

reports 34,397 inhabitants for this township. The majority of inhabitants belongs to the Maya ethnic group and
speaks the (main) local language, Popti', while a minority
is monolingual Spanish (28%). The area is home to a
close wild relative of maize, teosinte (Zea mays ssp. huehuetenangensis Doebley), first documented in Jacaltenango and its surroundings by Kempton and Popenoe
in 1935 [32]. According to Garrison Wilkes, who has
monitored the teosinte populations in the region over the
last decades, and visited the teosinte populations around

Jacaltenango in 2004, this subspecies is risking extinction
(G. Wilkes, pers. comm., December 2004).
Several scholars have raised the issue of changing maize
cultivars in Jacaltenango. Johannessen observed that especially the large landholders were taking the lead in introducing new maize cultivars into Jacaltenango, and
expressed concern about increasing dependence on monetary resources in order to repeatedly buy new 'hybrid'
seeds [21]. On the basis of a comparison between Stadel-

man's [23] data and interviews done in 2001, Steinberg
and Taylor concluded that maize diversity knowledge in
Jacaltenango and other townships of Huehuetenango
seemed to have decreased since 1937 [4]. They indicate
that the political violence of the 1980s and its consequences might have contributed to the loss of agricultural
knowledge and biodiversity. The present study evaluates
these views for Jacaltenango.
Among the literature on the social aspects of life in Jacaltenango, Casaverde's ethnography, which focuses on
social organization, was found particularly useful. It suggests a complex ethnic, territorial and social organization
in Jacaltenango [33]. The township was affected by political bloodshed during the armed conflict, which formally
ended in 1996. Victor Montejo's well-known book Testimony is an eyewitness account of political violence in a
community of Jacaltenango [34]. For Jacaltenango, the
ComisiÃ³n de Esclarecimiento HistÃ³rico reports 46 cases of
human rights violations and violent acts between 1980
and 1985, which involved more than 105 killed and disappeared persons [[35], Annex II]. Many people fled from
the area, often to Mexico, but others decided to stay or
were compelled to do so, often as members of the paramilitary self-defence patrols.
The township of Jacaltenango was chosen as a study site
for two reasons. First, the number of cultivar names
reported in Jacaltenango is the highest for any township in
the region [23]. This indicates the exceptional diversity of
maize in this township, and is probably related to the fact
that the township territory covers an altitudinal transect
(Figure 1). Informants usually distinguished three environments: hot (below 1,400 masl) temperate (between
1,400 masl and 2,000 masl) and cold (above 2,000 masl).
(The numbers are indicative only; classification is not very
crisp.) Second, there was a unique opportunity to study
historical change with the availability of two independent
cultivar lists made up in the first half of the twentieth century by visiting ethnographers.

In 1927, the township of Jacaltenango was studied by two
US ethnographers, Oliver LaFarge and Douglas Byers [36].
In the resulting monograph on traditional Indian culture
in the township, the authors mention the remarkable
number of farmer maize cultivars in Jacaltenango and give
a list of thirteen cultivars and some of their characteristics.
In 1937, farmers' knowledge of maize cultivars in Jacaltenango was recorded by Raymond Stadelman [23].
Gathering information initially only in Todos Santos, Stadelman soon realized that in neighbouring villages maize
diversity was more abundant - perhaps being informed by
Todos Santos maize traders who travelled across the
region [25]. Subsequently, Stadelman visited most towns
of the region to record data on maize cultivars and maize
cultivation. For Jacaltenango he gives 23 names and their
main characteristics. Stadelman's lack of reference to
LaFarge and Byers' earlier publication, and some discrepancies between the two studies in spelling and interpretation suggest that the two farmer cultivar lists are
independent.
In the following sections, Jacaltec cultivar names in the
native language will be written in bold, and cultivar
names in Spanish will be capitalized. The article follows
the modern spelling rules for cultivar names. The unique
number between brackets that follows each cultivar name
should make comparisons possible, in spite of spelling
differences.

Research question and methods
The main question this research attempts to answer is:
Which changes in maize cultivar knowledge occurred during the twentieth century in Jacaltenango? Changes might
include both loss of knowledge, and the acquisition of
knowledge about new or newly introduced cultivars. It
will be attempted to answer this question by using the cultivar lists from 1927 and 1937 as a baseline, to be compared with interview data collected in 2004.
During the last quarter of 2004, a field assistant from Jacaltenango interviewed 40 male farmers in the township
capital (cabecera) and eight other communities (aldeas) in

Page 5 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

Journal of Ethnobiology and Ethnomedicine 2006, 2:12

of Jacaltenango (Figure 1; Table 1). Male farmers are generally more knowledgeable on maize diversity in this area
[4]. This is probably due to the gendered labour division;
men are generally responsible for maize cultivation. Care
was taken to include both older and younger informants
in the sample for all communities. The communities were
chosen to reflect the altitudinal and social variation of the
township area. Jacaltenango has three native social segments, called Jacaltenango, San AndrÃ©s, and San Marcos,
and several foreign segments [33]. As shown in Table 1,
the survey covers all three native segments, and several
foreign ones.
The available information was processed following five
steps. First, the quality of the baseline data was assessed.
Then, the commensurability between the baseline and
survey data was evaluated. Having established this, continuity and losses of cultivar knowledge were documented
and analyzed. Also, the spatial and social distribution of
this knowledge was subjected to further analysis. New cultivars in the area were also documented. The remainder of
this section details the methods used for each of these
steps.
Quality of the baseline data
The unique historical data available for Jacaltenango (two
independent cultivar lists) permit a limited assessment of
the consistency of the classification of maize cultivars by
farmers in the past. If a cultivar classification system is
fully consistent, the criteria farmers use to assign cultivar
names to seed lots should be the same for all farmers. This
measure of consistency can be used to compare the
reported characteristics of the cultivars recorded by ethnographers in 1927 and 1937, to test the value of cultivar
naming in terms of phenotypic diversity. Only if some
minimal degree of consistency can be shown, the cultivar
names have value to trace diachronic change. The meaning of the cultivar names might contain additional information about the link with biological categories of
diversity. The question whether the two cultivar lists give
a complete representation of the cultivars that were
present in Jacaltenango also needs discussion.
Commensurability of the baseline and 2004 survey data
If it can be demonstrated that cultivar classification in the
first half of the twentieth century is consistent between
farmers (previous section), in order to establish meaningful comparisons between two moments, it is also necessary to examine the consistency of cultivar naming over
time. The need to establish the stability of cultivar name
meanings between 1927/37 and 2004 was foreseen in the
interview protocol. In each interview, first, a cultivar name
recorded by the 1927/37 studies was mentioned and the
farmer was asked if he knew this cultivar. If the answer was
affirmative, the farmer was asked what characterized this

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2/1/12

cultivar. This was asked in relation to (1) adaptation to
environment (cold, temperate, hot), (2) grain colour
(white, yellow, black, spotted, other), and (3) planting
and harvesting dates (given in dates, from which the
growing cycle was calculated). This was repeated for all
cultivars given in the historical cultivar lists. All three cultivar attributes are available for 1927/37 and these data
were used for a comparison to test the consistency of cultivar definitions over time.
Perceived continuity and losses of cultivars
In the interview, for each historical cultivar known to the
farmer, the question was asked whether the known cultivar was still grown (answer: yes/no). The informant was
also asked to free-list cultivars that had become rare or
had disappeared in his opinion. When the interviewed
farmer indicated a cultivar, open questions were asked
about the causes of disappearance or rareness.

The answers to the first question were analyzed using
methods from 'Consensus Theory' to determine probabilities of presence/absence of each cultivar [37]. The used
method employs a measure of informant competence to
calculate the probabilities that a certain outcome is true.
Informant competence is defined as 'the probability that
an informant knows the answer'. This definition implies a
correction for guessing, which might produce correct
answers, while the informant does not know the answer.
The theory takes the overall closeness of a particular
informant to the other informants as a measure of informant competency. This assumes that consensus between
informants is related to the phenomena under study.
The chosen design in the present study deviates in one
important aspect from the method proposed by Romney
et al. [37]. Throughout the interview, informants had the
possibility to indicate they did not know a certain cultivar
at all, or did not know if it was still present in the community (leading to missing observations on cultivar presence). Data with missing values are not suited for the
analysis proposed by Consensus Theory [38]. A proximate
method was taken instead. To calculate agreement
between informants, the number of cultivars on which
each pair of informant agreed with respect to its absence
or presence in the community was divided by the total
number of cultivars they both gave a value for present or
absent. This leads to a bias: the presence/absence opinions about well known cultivars is taken into account
many more times than those for badly known cultivars in
the calculation of informant competencies. Therefore, the
analysis assumes that the informants' competency in judging the presence/absence of broadly known cultivars is a
predictor for their competency to judge the same for less
known cultivars.

Social and spatial distribution of cultivar knowledge
This research question anticipates the possibility of unequal distributions of farmer knowledge between persons
and communities. This issue is important for methodological comparisons with regards to sample sizes and distributions. The influence of age on cultivar knowledge will
be evaluated, and the influence of environmental conditions and community boundaries. The latter might be
important as in the second half of the twentieth century,
communities in Jacaltenango tended to become more
socially isolated [33].

older cultivars and the emergence of new cultivars are part
of a single dynamic of cultivar replacement.

Knowledge of new cultivars
Another aspect of knowledge about maize diversity and
change is the emergence of 'new' cultivars. Through an
open question each informant was asked to identify these
cultivars together with some defining characteristics
(adaptation, grain colour and growing cycle). This question will also allow assessing to what extent the loss of

From the table it is evident that the characteristics mentioned for each cultivar are remarkably consistent. Both
studies recorded climatic adaptation for all cultivars

three zones (cold, temperate and hot), while Stadelman
splits them in two (cold and warm). For the two extreme

data show full agreement. For the temperate environment
of LaFarge and Byer, Stadelman gives two warm and three
cold cultivars, an equilibrated mix. Grain colour data are
consistent, also for the cultivar names that do not include
colour specifications as part of their name. As LaFarge and
Byer did not report on growing cycles, comparisons for
this aspect are not possible.
Cultivars are not completely distinguishable using the two
mentioned characteristics in Table 2 (environmental
adaptation and grain colour). For instance, k'ej wah (1)
and kok k'ej wah (4) are both cultivars of cold environments and with yellow kernel colour. There are two possible situations. First, the latter might be a subgroup of the
former class. (In this example, the names suggest the latter
cultivar is a subtype of a class which bears the first name.)
The other possibility is that the cultivars have other differences not reported by either LaFarge and Byers or Stadelman.
Examining cultivar names might add some information
on other relevant differences. In addition to information
about kernel colour, environmental adaptation and growing cycle, names contain information on geographic origin. The cultivar PantaleÃ³n (24), like the other cultivars

bearing Spanish names, was introduced from a coffee
farm in Guatemala's southern piedmont area. There is
indeed an existing coffee farm that bears the same name
[39]. The name 'Xhamaltin' (19) probably refers to a place
called San MartÃ­n. However, it could not be determined
on the basis of names if cultivar names indeed refer to the
smallest units in farmer classifications or refer to broader
classes in a hierarchy. Perceptions of farmers in 2004
might not reflect those in the first half of the twentieth
century. Therefore, all reported maize cultivar names (n =
24) were included in the analysis.
It is evident that Stadelman's list is more comprehensive
than LaFarge and Byers's. Stadelman mentions 23 cultivars, while LaFarge and Byers list thirteen. In two
instances, Stadelman gives a finer subclassification of a
cultivar mentioned by LaFarge and Byers, while only in
one case, LaFarge and Byers split a single cultivar mentioned by Stadelman into two minor units. One cultivar,
ockal tsaiik (17), is mentioned exclusively by LaFarge and
Byers, but our 2004 survey revealed that this cultivar name
does not refer to maize, but to common bean (Phaseolus
vulgaris L.). Assuming that (1) no cultivar change occurred
between 1927 and 1937, and (2) that all cultivars had an
equal chance to be reported, it might be suggested that

Growing cycle of cultivars compared between data of 1937 (Stadelman [23]) and 2004 (survey). Dashed line indicates a hypothetical 1:1 relationship.

Stadelman's list approaches completeness, as it includes
all cultivars reported by LaFarge and Byers. However,
especially the second assumption is likely not entirely
realistic. The fact that some cultivars occur only on one of
the lists, might be an indication of their relative scarcity.
Even so, taken together, the two lists most likely give an
adequate and rather complete picture of Jacaltenango's
most common maize cultivars between 1927 and 1937.

Commensurability of the baseline and 2004 survey data
The 2004 survey included questions on climate adaptation, growing season and grain colour. Comparing the
answers to these questions with the historical data gives a
measure of the stability of the cultivar classification in
Jacaltenango during the twentieth century. Table 3 shows
the result of the comparison.

Climate adaptation data seem inconsistent only in three
out of 25 cases. For Chimbo, in the 2004 survey there is

consensus among the informants (n = 3) that it grows in
temperate environments. LaFarge and Byers classify this
cultivar as being grown in a hot environment. However, as
boundaries between adjacent environments are somewhat arbitrary, this case of misclassification might not be
relevant. For k'ej sat (6) informants mention all three
environments as valid for this cultivar, but a majority
assigns it to the hot environments. Perhaps the cultivar
shows a broad adaptation, and spreads out from the temperate environment (as indicated by LaFarge and Byers) to
both warmer and colder environments. The most serious
case of misclassification is q'an wah (18), which is unanimously classified as a cultivar with an adaptation to hot
environments (n = 5), while Stadelman reported it was
adapted to cold growing environments. However, generally the data are consistent.
The most common answer on colour data disagrees with
the historical data in four of the fifteen cases the latter data
are available. In three of the four cases of disagreement,
currently little consensus exists and the colour mentioned
in the historical source is also frequently mentioned (data
not shown). In the remaining case, the historical data

might be wrong, when it classifies q'an nhal (7) as white,
as the name of this cultivar includes an element (q'an)
that means yellow.
The time difference between planting and harvesting was
taken as the length of the growing cycle for each cultivar
for both Stadelman's data and the 2004 survey data. There
is a significant, positive correlation between the two datasets for growing cycle length (r2 = 0.54; p = 0.0001). There
is a systematic change in the cultivars with longer growing
seasons; they are generally under the 1:1 line in Figure 2.
Stadelman reported planting dates in April for all highland cultivars, while according to the 2004 survey May or
June is the norm. Rainfall and soil moisture early in the
season might have become more limiting in recent decades. Given that the tendency is present across the whole
sample, it does not interfere with cultivar identity. There
is, however, one outlier: txilitxwah (5). According to Stadelman this cultivar is the only one for cold environments
that has such a short growing season (Table 2). This exceptional status might explain the discrepancy; Stadelman or
his informants probably made a mistake.

*The means are not equal among communities (ANOVA; p = 0.02)

Overall, the consistency between the historical data and
the data of the survey is strong enough to conclude that
the mentioned cultivars are very likely the same ones in
1927/37 and in 2004. This suggests the data on farmer's
knowledge of cultivar occurrence are sufficiently reliable
to determine the continuity or disappearance of the cultivars that were present at the beginning of the twentieth
century in Jacaltenango.
Perceived continuity and losses of cultivars
All cultivar names recorded by Stadelman or LaFarge and
Byers in the first half of the twentieth century were recognized by some of the informants in 2004 (n = 40), varying
from 3 informants for the least known cultivars to 39 for
the best known (Table 4). Informants knew 13.7 cultivars
on average (57.1%), varying from 7 to 20 (SD = 2.9).

For 39 informants cultivar presence/absence judgments
are available. According to the Consensus Theory analysis,
77% (30 out of 39) of the informants have a competence
of more than 0.8 and 67% (26 out of 39) exceed 0.9. Average competence is 0.85. These high competence numbers
indicate that the judgments are generally consistent
among different informants. Thus, even though the
number of responses for the rare cultivars are low (Table
4), as could have been expected, given the informant competencies calculated on the basis of the whole range of cultivars, a probability of the presence for these cultivars can
be calculated.
There is no significant correlation between informant
competence and the number of cultivars informants
judged, or their perceived Spanish language skills (p <
0.05). Age has a weak negative correlation with competence (r2 = 0.14; p = 0.02). Since most deviations from

consensus are related to absence judgements of cultivars,
it follows that older informants tend to be slightly more
pessimistic about cultivar presence than younger informants. However, older informants also know more cultivars
than younger informants, which is a stronger tendency (r2
= 0.24; p < 0.01). Thus, age related differences in knowledge did probably not influence the findings of this study.
In Table 4, counts for cultivar knowledge and opinions of
presence and probabilities of presence (following Consensus Theory) are presented. The data show a general
agreement between the (perceived) presence of the cultivar by the informants that know the cultivar and the
knowledge of the cultivar across the whole population of
informants. However, the association is not complete. For
instance, k'ejti' (20) is known by only three informants,
but according to these informants the cultivar is still
present. In contrast, Tejar (23), another cultivar known by
only three informants, probably ceased to exist in Jacaltenango. Another interesting characteristic is that even
the most rare cultivars were always known in at least two
communities
Following these findings, three cultivars have disappeared
in Jacaltenango during a 70 year period. All three cultivars
that were likely lost, have Spanish, not native Popti'
names. According to informants, these cultivars were
introduced originally from coffee plantations to which
Jacalteco workers temporarily migrated in the coffee harvest season to work. Several causes for the disappearance
or scarcity of cultivars are mentioned. There is no clear
pattern apparent in the causes in relation to certain cultivars; most causes apply to all. The most important reason
is the yield disadvantage of the traditional cultivars
against the introduced cultivars. With the same fertiliza-

tion levels, traditional cultivars yield less. They also grow
taller and are more prone to lodging (the bending over
and falling of plants). The introduction of industrial fertilizers in the 1960s [40] has accentuated this problem, as
cultivars developed even more biomass. The higher disease susceptibility of the cultivars Chimbo (14) and PantaleÃ³n (24) was also mentioned as a reason for their
disappearance. Another reason the informants mentioned
was climate change. According to some informants the
growing environment has become warmer and drier. Land
use change (more coffee) was also mentioned (this is also
a primary cause for the high teosinte extinction risk, G.
Wilkes, pers. comm., December 2004).
Social and spatial distribution of cultivar knowledge
In Table 5, the distribution of cultivar knowledge over
communities, informants and cultivar adaptation groups
is given. A single-factor analysis of variance for differences
in cultivar knowledge among communities shows that the
community means are not equal (p = 0.02) (mean age of
informants was not significantly different between different communities).

Knowledge of cultivars grown in cold and temperate environments is roughly stable across communities. The most
significant differences exist in knowledge of the cultivars
in the hot growing environment. The township capital of
Jacaltenango itself is ranking the second lowest in number

of cultivars per informant and the total number of cultivars known. Together, the five informants from the township capital only knew three out of eight cultivars adapted
to hot environments. The only community that scored
worse was Paya, where only three informants were interviewed and which is the community that is most remote
from the low area in distance and altitude of all sampled
communities (Figure 1).
These observations strongly suggest that spreading the
interview sample over several communities might have
enhanced the research design. It also suggests that relying
on interviews in the township capital alone would have
led to serious underestimations of farmer knowledge of
historical cultivars in Jacaltenango. This is an important
point about method and will be taken up in the discussion.
Knowledge of new cultivars
Table 6 gives the names that were mentioned for cultivars
that were not included in the historical data. At least a
large majority of this list of cultivars is introduced during
recent decades, and from the 2004 survey data no additional historical cultivars (being in Jacaltenango for more
than 70 years) could be added.

More than half of the introduced cultivars are grown only
in hot environments, and only four are grown in temper-

ate climates alone. This tendency corresponds to the pattern of cultivar loss: the lost cultivars were adapted to
warm environments. Among the grain colours, white
dominates. This is generally the commercial grain in Guatemala, whereas most yellow grain is for home consumption. Most of the new cultivars are fast growers (average:
4.4 months). A short growing cycle, lower plant stature,
and a higher yield was indicated as an important reason
for their introduction.

It may be concluded that farmer cultivar names partly
reflect the use and history of seeds, but that for the cultivars included in the baseline data, phenotypic differences
played a relatively important role in classification and
naming. Morphological and genetic studies are needed to
further examine the biological meaning of cultivar names
in Jacaltenango and other parts of the western highlands
of Guatemala. Meanwhile, it may be assumed that cultivar
differences are relevant biologically.

The informants reported that the introduced maize was
coming from various geographical sources, which are
partly reflected in the cultivar names. Maize seed comes
from the commercial maize growing areas of the Pacific
coast (reflected in the cultivar name 'MÃ¡quina', which
refers to an important maize growing area of the Pacific
coast, called La MÃ¡quina), the national agricultural institute (ICTA), and Mexico (TuxpeÃ±o, and probably others).
The influx from planting materials from Mexico might be
related to the return of refugees who fled to Mexico during
the political violence of the 1980s. "Rocamey" in Table 6
probably refers to Rocamex, a variety introduced in the
1960s in broad areas of Central America, which was originally bred at the Mexican Agricultural Program of the
Rockefeller Foundation in Mexico. The names also contain information on the person who introduced it (Lucas,
Manuel Juan).

Cultivar change in Jacaltenango
The findings suggest that a small loss of historical maize
cultivars occurred. Mainly factors related to production
shape the way in which maize cultivar change occurs in
Jacaltenango. Motivations for change are related to cultivar characteristics related to their production ecology, specifically plant height, growing cycle and disease problems.
Broader underlying causes included a perceived climate
change and the introduction of fertilizers. Climate change
towards a lower annual precipitation and higher annual
temperatures over the last century has indeed been documented for the region [41].

Discussion
Cultivar names
On basis of the criteria applied in this study, cultivar
names were generally consistently related to biological
characteristics. Cultivar characteristics between the two
historical data sources showed close correspondence. The
same was true for the comparison between the historical
data and the data for the 2004 survey. Also, in the few
cases a disagreement was detected, often a reasonable
explication was available. This suggests that cultivar
names generally refer to the same units of maize diversity,
as distinguished by farmers.

For the first half of the twentieth century and also for
2004, classification of maize diversity imply more than
phenotypic categories. It includes additional information
about the geographic origin, and in the case of more
recently introduced seeds, the person responsible for the
introduction. This suggests that in some cases, cultivars
might be distinguished not on the basis of visible characters or use, but their history. It seems that this is increasingly so, because the new cultivar names reflect a plethora
of incoming diversity, and the names suggest that categorization is no longer mainly related to phenotypic categories.

Loss of cultivars is localised in the lower areas of the township and limited to those cultivars which had been introduced before 1937 from coffee farms outside the
community. Since the original source of the replaced historical cultivars is regional, they are probably not of
unique value. A regional assessment of cultivar loss is necessary to determine if this phenomenon is general. However, the production problems the lost cultivars reportedly
had, suggest farmers do not regret these losses.
The prevalence of crop ecological factors in cultivar loss
suggests that the political violence of the 1980s has had
led to little or no loss of cultivars. Thus, our study disproves Steinberg and Taylor's [4] suggestion that political
violence in the 1980s would have led to a sweeping loss
of maize cultivars. In spite of many deaths and massive
migration, the continued residence of some groups in the
village even at the heights of violence (civil patrols, for
instance), the short absence of others, and the possible
exchange and recuperation of seeds, apparently helped to
conserve farmer cultivars. It should be noted that a
detailed study of the impact of the genocide and violence
in Rwanda reported little absolute loss of bean, potato and
sorghum genetic diversity, although it noted problems
with accessing diversity by particular farmers and (in the
case of potatoes) acquiring sufficient volumes of planting
materials [42].
The fact that none of the informants knew all historical
cultivars (nor all informants from each community
together), implies that very likely a change in the relative
abundance of the historical cultivars occurred. (However,

see below for the possibly complicating effect of changed
distributions of knowledge.) This effect is strongest for the
cultivars adapted to warm environments. This is an
important finding, which may be related to another aspect
of cultivar change: the introduction of seeds from other
areas into Jacaltenango.
The many new cultivars mentioned by informants are
largely confined to the lower areas of Jacaltenango. Several foreign cultivars have been introduced to temperate
parts of the townships, but less than to warm environments. No new cultivar for cold environments was
reported. This difference in relative openness of low and
high parts of the landscape for cultivars from outside
reflects a broader trend in maize biogeography. Genetic
studies based on maize materials available before the
introduction of improved varieties, have observed
increased genetic isolation with increased altitude [13].
This suggests that rather stable, ecological constraints to
seed and cultivar exchange underlie the differences
between high and low areas.
Extracommunal seed sources changed over the twentieth
century. Before 1937, the sources of cultivars outside Jacaltenango included mostly the coffee farms in the southern
piedmont areas. In the last decades, the focus shifted
towards the formal seed sector (ICTA, agricultural input
shops), the commercial maize growing areas that were
developed on the Pacific Coast, towards Mexico. Crossborder contacts increased as many people fled to Mexico
following political violence in the 1980s. Thus, in this way
political violence did influence maize diversity in Jacaltenango.
The new cultivars in Jacaltenango are mostly recycled seed
lots that stem from modern varieties. Their reported
advantages (lower plant stature, shorter growing cycle,
higher yields) indicate that the motivations for cultivar
change are crop ecological. The production problems that
motivate cultivar change are also present in the higher
areas of Jacaltenango. In the cold environments no change
was observed. It might be true that poor access to foreign
cultivars adapted to this area constrains cultivar change in
the higher parts. Further examination of this possibility is
needed.
Three findings suggest that the loss or rareness of older
cultivars and the introduction of new cultivars in Jacaltenango might be part of one coordinated long-term
trend of cultivar replacement. First, cultivar losses and
introductions take place in the same growing environment, the lower parts of Jacaltenango. Second, for both
processes, similar ecological motivations are mentioned
by farmers in the area. Third, in the interviews, farmers
often made direct comparisons between the older culti-

vars on the one hand, and the newly introduced cultivars
on the other hand, especially in terms of yield. In this case
there are strong indications that replacement may be an
important aspect of cultivar change in the lower areas.
However, since many of the cultivars reported in 1927/37
are still present, apparently households have certain reasons to conserve them. The present study was not able to
uncover these reasons.
Methodological comparisons with an earlier study
In 2001, geographers Michael K. Steinberg and Matthew
Taylor did a field study in highland Guatemala with the
hypothesis that political violence would have caused
major maize cultivar loss [4]. Their study comprised six
townships in the department of Huehuetenango, including Jacaltenango. The authors used Stadelman's [23]
report as baseline data, and interviewed ten persons from
each township capital to compare their knowledge to Stadelman's list. Steinberg and Taylor conclude that cultivar
knowledge has diminished severely in this area since the
early twentieth century, from 30 to 13 cultivars. For Jacaltenango, Steinberg and Taylor found that cultivar knowledge diminished from eight to three cultivars (a loss of
62.5%). Steinberg and Taylor imply that Stadelman
reported only eight cultivars for Jacaltenango, while the
present study derives 23 cultivars from Stadelman's text
(Table 1). Steinberg and Taylor used an incomplete table
from Stadelman's report, that referred to the ears he collected (Table VII in Stadelman [23], M.K. Steinberg, pers.
comm., 24-06-2005). Although Steinberg and Taylor
emphasise the preliminary character of their study, since
the present study estimates that cultivar loss in Jacaltenango was considerably lower (around 13%), a
detailed comparison between the methodologies of the
two studies is warranted.

Steinberg and Taylor modelled their sampling method on
the one used by the ethnographers of the first half of the
twentieth century. So given equal methods, if farmers
reported less cultivars to Steinberg and Taylor than to Stadelman in several townships, this would suggest change
occurred. However, the method employed by Steinberg
and Taylor does not provide information about the certainty of this outcome.
The method of Steinberg and Taylor estimates cultivar loss
directly from the total number of cultivars known by a
small number of farmers in each township. The present
study shows the least known cultivars include those which
are judged to be no longer present. This would support
Steinberg and Taylor's method in general, but misleads in
the case of lesser known cultivars that continue to exist. In
Jacaltenango, at least one cultivar was as little known as
the cultivars that were deemed to have disappeared, but
was thought to be still present.

A more important issue is, however, that in Steinberg and
Taylor's methodology no judgment can be made about
whether the number of interviews is sufficient to have a
certain degree of certainty about the outcomes. More
intensive sampling will tend to increase the number of
cultivars known by informants, thus changing the outcome. A related problem is where to draw the boundary
between present and absent cultivars when in fact all cultivars are still remembered (as is the case of the present
study). Steinberg and Taylor's overestimation of cultivar
loss (or their suggestion in this direction) is a direct consequence of a lack of checks in their method.
One possible interpretation of the study of Steinberg and
Taylor is that it provides information on the relative abundance of historical cultivars in comparison with the past.
However, it should be indicated that this would assume
that the township capital in 1937 and 2004 are equivalent
units of analysis. This assumption can be discussed in the
light of the findings obtained with the methodology presented in this article, which give some clues about the current spatial distribution of cultivar knowledge (next
section).
Social and spatial distribution of cultivar knowledge
Several findings of the present study point to an unequal
social distribution of maize cultivar knowledge in 2004.
First, informants from some communities knew less historical cultivars than informants from other communities.
Informants in Jacaltenango in this study proved to be
some of the least knowledgeable on maize cultivars. The
poor knowledge of farmers in the capital town might have
led to the underestimation of farmer knowledge in Steinberg and Taylor's study, whose informants were encountered in the capital towns only. Second, the incoming
cultivars show an extraordinary number of cultivar names,
many being mentioned by one informant only. It seems
as if the numerous cultivar introductions outstrip the
capacity of seed and knowledge exchange in Jacaltenango.

Stadelman's [23] data indicate that a knowledgeable male
adult living in the township capital of Jacaltenango might
know many of the less abundant cultivars of the area. The
present study suggests that in 2004 the same was true for
many informants from communities in Jacaltenango, but
not for all informants, including those from the township
capital. This finding might reflect a change in the distribution of maize between the head town and the other communities, which have a more rural character, and perhaps
between the rural communities as well.
Broader socio-economic trends might explain a possible
change in the social distribution of maize knowledge. In
the first half of the twentieth century, maize was more
important for the monetary economy than in 2004, and a

http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2/1/12

main node in this economy was the head town. Now,
maize has a minor role, while other crops (especially coffee) and other occupations have become more prominent
economically. Economic change might have diverged
interest into other issues than maize diversity. Another
possible explanation is a decrease in knowledge transmission. Intergenerational knowledge transmission might
still underpin the social memory about disappeared cultivars that was observed in this study. However, the growing
population of Jacaltenango, increasing social isolation
and independence between communities and their
increasing regional and national orientations [33,43]
might have added to a fragmentation of traditional agricultural knowledge systems in rural Guatemala. Also, the
political violence of the past might have reduced the trust
and solidarity that underpins seed and knowledge
exchange [44].

Conclusion
This study has described the application of a methodology
to examine change in farmer knowledge of cultivars. It has
demonstrated that sensible results can be obtained with
the used methodology, which might have interesting
implications for biological change as well. By taking a spatially stratified sample in an area of exceptional cultivar
knowledge, rich ecological diversity and presumably
maize biodiversity, it produces information that might be
impossible to obtain in a regional investigation, but contains insights that possibly apply to a much larger area
than the extent of this study.
This article has shown that maize cultivars names identified three generations earlier in a Guatemalan highland
township are still present in the social memory. Relative
certainty existed about certain trends of cultivar change in
the township, which in broad terms correspond to the
same perceptions of biological diversity, where their consistency could be tested. Consensus existed about the disappearance of a small number of cultivars adapted to
warm growing environments (below 1,500 masl) due to
problems related to crop production. This was also the
area where cultivar introductions from other areas concentrated. Ecological factors are reportedly important in
cultivar change, perhaps contributing to a slow replacement of the older cultivars with new ones. Given the
importance of ecological factors, these insights might
prove to apply to broader areas with similar ecologies.
One question that merits special attention are the production problems of the high environments in the study area,
which are perhaps as serious as the problems in the low
environments, but do not seem to have obvious (seedbased) solutions.
The reported research has generated various insights in the
role of social factors in cultivar change. Political violence

did evidently not cause an observable absolute loss of cultivars in the study area, contrary to the expectations raised
by earlier research. On the other hand, it was observed
that the regional social connections that underpin cultivar
introductions changed in geographical focus over the
twentieth century. As these changes are part of broad
socio-economic trends they might affect other parts of the
region as well. Also, several findings suggest a change in
the social and spatial distribution of cultivar knowledge
within the township during the twentieth century. This
paper substantiates that (changing) knowledge distributions potentially constitute an important issue for methodology and interpretation in research on change in
cultivar knowledge.

Appendix: Consensus analysis

10.

For the consensus analysis, the proportion of presence/
absence agreement was calculated for each pair of informants for the cultivars known in common only. This was
corrected for possible agreement due to guessing, following Romney et al. [37]. The resulting matrix was loaded as
a correlation matrix into SAS 9.1 for Windows [45], and
analyzed using the principal components method of the
Factor procedure and a Varimax rotation. The first factor
solution corresponded to 79.8 % of the variance, and the
second and third corresponded to 10.8 % and 7.3 %
respectively. The high value for the first factor compared
to the next ones partially confirms the suitability of consensus theory for these data [37]. Factor loadings for the
first factor solution included one negative value (-0.07).
Since negative knowledge or sabotage seems unlikely, this
indicates that the correction for guessing may lead to conservative (underestimated) informant competence values.
Constraining presence judgements to known cultivars
perhaps filters out much guessing already. The first-factor
loadings for each informant were used as competence values. From these, the probability of presence for each cultivar was calculated, following Romney et al. [37].
