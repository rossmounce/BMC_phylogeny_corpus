Abstract
Background: Past studies in the legume family (Fabaceae) have uncovered several evolutionary
trends including differential mutation and diversification rates across varying taxonomic levels. The
legume tribe Psoraleeae is shown herein to exemplify these trends at the generic and species levels.
This group includes a sizable diversification within North America dated at approximately 6.3
million years ago with skewed species distribution to the most recently derived genus, Pediomelum,
suggesting a diversification rate shift. We estimate divergence dates of North American (NAm)
Psoraleeae using Bayesian MCMC sampling in BEAST based on eight DNA regions (ITS, waxy, matK,
trnD-trnT, trnL-trnF, trnK, trnS-trnG, and rpoB-trnC). We also test the hypothesis of a diversification
rate shift within NAm Psoraleeae using topological and temporal methods. We investigate the
impact of climate change on diversification in this group by (1) testing the hypothesis that a shift
from mesic to xeric habitats acted as a key innovation and (2) investigating diversification rate shifts
along geologic time, discussing the impact of Quaternary climate oscillations on diversification.
Results: NAm Psoraleeae represents a recent, rapid radiation with several genera originating
during the Pleistocene, 1 to 2 million years ago. A shift in diversification rate is supported by both
methods with a 2.67-fold increase suggested around 2 million years ago followed by a 8.73-fold
decrease 440,000 years ago. The hypothesis that a climate regime shift from mesic to xeric habitats
drove increased diversification in affected taxa was not supported. Timing of the diversification rate
increase supports the hypothesis that glaciation-induced climate changes during the Quaternary
influenced diversification of the group. Nonrandom spatial diversification also exists, with greater
species richness in the American Southwest.
Conclusion: This study outlines NAm Psoraleeae as a model example of a recent, rapid radiation.
Diversification rate shifts in NAm Psoraleeae are not due to current climate regimes as
represented by habitat, but instead to past global climate change resulting from Quaternary
glaciations. NAm Psoraleeae diversification is a good example of how earthly dynamics including
global climate change and topography work together to shape biodiversity.

Background
The legume family (Fabaceae) is the third largest plant
family on earth with an estimated 19,000 species [1]. A
study of diversification across angiosperms found Fabales
(that is, Fabaceae, Quillajaceae, Polygalaceae, and Surianaceae) as one of 13 angiosperm orders to exhibit higher
than expected diversification rates [2]. Within Fabales,
Fabaceae exhibits greater diversification than the other relatively species-poor families. Furthermore, within
Fabaceae, the subfamily Papilionoideae contains the bulk
of species (~14,000) compared with Mimosoideae and
Caesalpinioideae. This uneven distribution of species
diversity continues down to lower taxonomic levels in
Papilionoideae with Astragalus containing upwards of
2500 species [3,4]. Although Astragalus does not exhibit
higher diversification rates relative to other related genera,
the Astragalean clade, comprising Astragalus and a subset
of the Galegeae tribe, does [3]. Other studies of Fabaceae
have examined diversification rates and timing of divergence, focusing on generic or higher levels in the family
[5,6]. The collection of research discussed above provides
precedent for uneven diversification and shifts in diversification rates within Fabaceae, phenomena relatively
unexplored at the species level (but see [7,8]).
Studies based on chloroplast coding genes matK and rbcL
found elevated nucleotide substitution rates for the tribe
Psoraleeae relative to other legume clades, suggestive of
rapid evolution or diversification [5]. In addition,
research on transcontinental clades estimated the age of
the divergence between two Psoraleeae genera, Cullen of
Australia, and Rupertia, endemic to the western United
States, at approximately 6.3 million years ago (mya) [5].
This age estimate illustrates the recent diversification of
this group, especially as the North American (NAm) clade
of Psoraleeae diversified after this transcontinental split.
Evidence suggests that Psoraleeae represents a recent,
rapid radiation, making this group well suited to a specieslevel diversification study within Fabaceae.
Current circumscription of the Psoraleeae tribe includes a
monophyletic New World group of six genera: Hoita
(three spp.), Orbexilum (nine spp.), Pediomelum (29 spp.),
Psoralidium (three spp.), and Rupertia (three spp.) from
North America and Otholobium (six to eight spp.) in South
America [9,10]. Four Old World genera also exist: Cullen,
Bituminaria, Psoralea, and Otholobium, the latter of which
spans the Old and New Worlds [10]. When considering
the NAm clade, the skewed distribution of species richness towards Pediomelum suggests a shift in diversification
rate within NAm Psoraleeae.
Diversification is the net speciation and extinction of a
group. When coupled with evolutionary and ecological
processes, diversification is central to the creation of species richness. Differential species richness across taxo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/55

nomic and geographic levels has been widely studied,
with many hypotheses proposed to explain this variation
(reviewed by [11,12]). Most hypotheses concerning species richness focus on the impact of climatic factors on the
diversification of species across geographic regions,
endeavoring to find and explain global patterns of biodiversity. Hypotheses concerning the cause of diversification rate shifts, or net changes in speciation or extinction
rate that bear on relative species diversity, have also been
suggested including geographic range fragmentation,
ecology, competition, key innovations, and climate
change [13-18]. Climatic variables such as water and temperature account for much of the variation in species richness seen globally [19,20]. Indeed, climatic variables have
been implicated in studies of species richness and diversification of a wide range of organisms, including
angiosperms [21], amphibians [22], reptiles [23], vertebrates [24], insects [25], and birds [26,27], among others
[19].
Hypotheses of climate change are particularly relevant to
NAm Psoraleeae as climatic variables may affect habitat
and range variation past and present. The five NAm genera
span a variety of ecological habitats: Hoita is riparian, living strictly in moist soils along streams and springs in California; Rupertia resides on moderately moist slopes in
oak-pine communities of California; Orbexilum resides in
the semi-moist soils of forest communities of the Southeastern United States; Psoralidium lives in the semi-dry
soils of Midwestern and Intermountain grasslands and
deserts; and Pediomelum has adapted to well-drained soils
in dry, arid ecosystems of the deserts of the Intermountain
West and the grasslands and rock outcrops of the Midwestern United States [10,28,29]. Many habitats of
endemic Pediomelum species are characterized by arid, hot
environments such as the cedar glades of Tennessee, the
sandy deserts of the Southwestern United States, or the
limestone outcrops of the Edwards Plateau in Texas.
Observation of NAm Psoraleeae in light of evolutionary
relationships suggests a shift in climate regimes with Pediomelum, the largest genus, and Psoralidium shifting to
more xeric habitats, perhaps leading to increased diversification in these genera relative to other NAm Psoraleeae.
This leads to the postulate that adaptation to xeric habitats
may have acted as a key innovation, a trait whose origin
has spurred diversification within a group [30].
The young age estimate of the tribe suggests that NAm
Psoraleeae may have diversified in part in the Quaternary
era, a period replete with climate oscillations brought on
by glacial cycles. These shifts greatly influenced the range
and distribution of species across North America, as
ranges were contracted and expanded repeatedly. The
onset of climate change required plant species to move,
adapt, or go extinct. Upon glacial recession, new environPage 2 of 13

ments were open to colonization or expansion, often
requiring adaptation of existing flora [31,32]. These cycles
could influence speciation either through genetic differentiation spurred by range fragmentation into glacial refugia
or through admixture or introgression as previously isolated entities mixed and created new and differing gene
pools which contributed to speciation [33]. These events,
coupled with selection pressures caused by new environments or competitors, may have spurred genetic and/or
morphological change, perhaps influencing the tempo of
diversification. The idea of Quaternary climate shifts
impacting genetic divergence and diversification is not
new [34,35]. While most studies involving the influence
of this time period investigate intraspecific and population-level genetic divergence (for example,[36,37]), studies concerning the impact of this era on speciation also
exist but are more rare (for example, [31,38]). If NAm Psoraleeae diversified during this time, the tempo of diversification of this group may have been influenced by these
climate shifts.
In this study, we present NAm Psoraleeae as a model study
system for investigating the impact of climate change on
diversification within a recent, rapid radiation. We test the
hypothesis of a diversification rate shift within NAm Psoraleeae against the null hypothesis of no shift in diversification rate within the group. We then explore
diversification in light of various climate-related hypotheses. In particular, we test the hypothesis that a shift to xeric
habitats acted as a key innovation, thus spurring a diversification rate increase in Pediomelum and Psoralidium as
opposed to the rest of NAm Psoraleeae against the null
hypothesis of no net increase in diversification rate of
these genera. We also investigate the impact of Quaternary
climate oscillations on diversification of NAm Psoraleeae.
To do so, we estimate divergence times of NAm Psoraleeae
to determine if the group was diversifying during this
period. We then correlate diversification rate shifts to geologic time. The young age of this group provides a glimpse
into the emerging evolution of NAm Psoraleeae and the
impact of changing environments and climes on its radiation. In addition, the knowledge gained herein may provide insight into other species radiations that have
endured similar conditions, and serves as a model for the
study of diversification rates and ecological fluctuations in
the robust phylogenetic context of a recent, rapid radiation.

Results
Divergence dates
A molecular clock was rejected for each data set (p <
0.00001; 52 degrees of freedom), justifying the use of a
relaxed molecular clock for divergence dating. The mixed
model combined analysis from BEAST yielded a maximum clade credibility tree very similar to previously pub-

lished phylogenies [9], suggesting a monophyletic NAm
Psoraleeae (Figure 1). Individual gene analyses differed
somewhat in their divergence date estimates of key nodes
across Psoraleeae, illustrating the variation in rates of
molecular evolution and phylogenetic information content inherent in each gene region (Table 1). For the most
part, date estimates determined using nuclear markers are
similar to or younger than dates based on chloroplast
markers. Two exceptions to this pattern exist: the node
representing the most recent common ancestor (MRCA)
of Rupertia has the minimum date (ITS) and the maximum date (waxy) estimated by nuclear markers, while the
dates estimated for the MRCA of Glycine and Psoraleeae by
nuclear genes exceed those estimated by chloroplast
markers.
Considering the gene regions as a whole, the combined
mixed model analysis estimated the divergence date of
calibrated nodes closer to the date expected than an analysis that averaged date estimates across all gene regions.
For example, the calibrated node of the MRCA of Glycine
and Phaseolus should have had a mean of 19.2 mya; the
combined analysis estimated this divergence date at 19.1
mya while the average across the individual genes for this
node was 18.6 mya (Table 1). With the exception of Glycine and the MRCA of Glycine and Phaseolus, the mean
divergence date summarized across individual genes is
older than the mean divergence date estimated under the
combined mixed model analysis.
The minimum and maximum divergence date estimates
across the individual genes could be taken as a range of
uncertainty surrounding the divergence date of respective
nodes, much the way we utilize the credibility intervals
from Bayesian analyses. The ranges suggested across individual gene regions differ somewhat from the 95% high
posterior density (HPD) credibility interval determined in
the combined mixed model analysis. With the exception
of the MRCAs of Glycine/Psoraleeae, Orbexilum, Cullen,
and Glycine, the range obtained from the minimum and
maximum estimates across individual gene regions is
more conservative (wider) than the Bayesian credibility
interval from the combined analysis (see Table 1).
While divergence estimates from the combined mixed
model analysis differed from the average across individual
gene estimates, the difference is slight. Furthermore, the
divergence ranges suggested by utilizing the minimum
and maximum estimates across individual genes or the
range suggested by the 95% confidence interval (+/- 2
standard deviations) inferred using the mean across individual genes both exhibit considerable overlap with the
range suggested by the 95% HPD credibility interval. We
therefore confine our discussion to the dates and ranges
observed under the combined mixed model framework.

As estimated in the combined analysis, Psoraleeae began
diversifying in North America around 5.8 mya with the
split of the genus Hoita from the remaining taxa (Figure
1). Orbexilum split from the ancestor of Pediomelum, Psoralidium, and Rupertia shortly thereafter, with the genus
beginning to diversify around 2.8 mya (see Table 1 for
credibility intervals). Around 4.6 mya, the Pediomelum lineage split from the lineage leading to Psoralidium and
Rupertia, two genera which would later split around 3.3
mya. Rupertia began diversifying around 1.95 mya while
Psoralidium speciated around 1.15 mya. Pediomelum, the
largest genus, began diversifying around 3.2 mya.
Differential diversification rates
The results of the seven whole-tree statistics computed in
SymmeTREE using the 12 maximum parsimony tree
topologies suggest a significant shift in diversification
rates within NAm Psoraleeae with strong support (all statistics' p-value < 0.00001). The delta statistics, those that
help to localize the diversification rate shift to a certain
area of the phylogeny, did not find statistical support for
a single shift point of diversification rate. However, the
test does support that a shift took place, either gradually
over the whole phylogeny or in multiple places over time.

The birth-death likelihood (BDL) analysis based on the
maximum clade credibility tree from BEAST determined
the maximum likelihood estimate of the speciation rate
under the pureBirth model to be 0.58 speciation events
per million years for the combined data. BDL chose pureBirth as the best rate-constant model (Table 2). It was
therefore used as the null to calculate DAICrc for the rate
variable models. The critical value for DAICrc, as compared with the best rate-constant model, to maintain a significance level of a = 0.05 is 7.96. BDL found yule3rate as
the best rate-variable model (DAICrc = 11.732). We therefore reject the null hypothesis of rate-constancy because
the observed DAICrc > 7.96. According to the scenario suggested by the yule3rate model, NAm Psoraleeae began
diversifying with a net diversification rate of 0.35 speciation events per million years. A shift in net diversification
rate took place 2.05 mya in which the rate shifts dramatically to 0.96 speciation events per million years. The net
diversification rate shifted again around 0.44 mya,
decreasing to 0.11 speciation events per million years
(Table 2). A lineage through time plot illustrates the definitive 3-rate model as outlined in the BDL analysis (Figure
2). Combined evidence from the BDL and divergence date
analyses places the diversification rate shift at the origin of
the main Pediomelum radiation.
Testing of macroevolutionary hypotheses
The hypothesis of xeric habitats acting as a key innovation
in the diversification of NAm Psoraleeae based on the
1000 posterior distribution trees from the BEAST analysis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/55

was rejected (p-value = 0.80) using Ree's key innovation
test. The hypothesis that Quaternary climate shifts influenced diversification of NAm Psoraleeae is supported by
the acceptance of the yule3rate model having a diversification rate shift, st, between 2.5 and 0.8 mya, the time
span equating to glaciation-induced climate oscillations
during the Quaternary [39]. This translates to a 2.67-fold
increase in net diversification rate around 2 mya (Table 2;
Figures and 2).

Discussion
Recent, rapid radiations
The legume family is somewhat remarkable in that age
estimates of this incredibly diverse group are relatively
young, with transcontinental crown clade ages ranging
from 8 to 16 mya and intracontinental crown clade ages
ranging from 4 to 6 mya, providing a mostly Quaternary
to Neogene age distribution [5,6]. While Astragalus is the
legume poster child for rapid radiations, other recent,
rapid radiations exist within Fabaceae [40,41]. Such radiations are often characterized by short branch lengths, little sequence variation, and diverse morphology and
ecological habitats [42]. NAm Psoraleeae, especially Pediomelum, exhibits all of these characteristics [9,10]. This,
coupled with evidence of increased rates of molecular evolution and recent age estimates of transcontinental clades,
suggests that tribe Psoraleeae is a recent, rapid radiation
[5].
Divergence dates
Our divergence date estimates place the origin of NAm
Psoraleeae between 4.2 and 7.5 mya with a mean estimate
of 5.8 mya, concomitant with many other legume genera
[6]. Of particular interest in terms of divergence dates is
the largest genus, Pediomelum. Grimes' circumscription
segregates Pediomelum into three subgenera based on
branching pattern and dehiscence of inflorescences: subgenus Leucocraspedon includes P. rhombifolium and P. palmeri with remaining taxa split between subgenera
Disarticulatum and Pediomelum [10]. The diversification of
this genus began around 3 mya (Figure 1, Table 1) with
the split of subgenus Leucocraspedon from the remainder
of Pediomelum. The two species in subgenus Leucocraspedon differ greatly from the rest of the genus both morphologically and genetically [9,10], this evidenced in the
divergence of the two main Pediomelum lineages. The
remainder of Pediomelum began diversifying around 2
mya, constituting the main body of species richness of
NAm Psoraleeae. To place this in perspective with other
rapid radiations, the Hawaiian silverswords, the model for
adaptive radiations, diverged around 5 mya [43]. Within
Fabaceae, Astragalus was estimated to have diverged from
Oxytropis around 12 to 16 mya with Neo-Astragalus radiating approximately 4.4 mya [44], while the Andean radiation of Lupinus is dated around 1.5 mya [7]. These dates

Diversification rates
A rapid, family-wide diversification is strongly supported
in the legume family [5]. Psoraleeae is no exception. Estimates of diversification rates vary depending on the
model of diversification used in BDL on the maximum
clade credibility tree from BEAST (Table 2). However, all
our estimates of NAm Psoraleeae diversification are as fast
or faster than rates determined for other notable rapid
radiations: under the pureBirth model, a diversification
rate of 0.58 for NAm Psoraleeae is similar to other rapid
radiations including the Hawaiian Silverswords [43],
mosses [45], squamate reptiles [46], and salamanders
[47], all of which range between 0.4 and 0.8 speciation
events per million years.

Skewed species richness to Pediomelum suggests a shift in
net diversification rates within NAm Psoraleeae. Our analyses, including both topological and temporal methods,
confirmed this hypothesis. Whole-tree statistics based on
topology suggested a shift in diversification rate middepth in the phylogeny of NAm Psoraleeae. While a shift
was strongly supported, the topological method was unable to decipher between the presence of multiple shifts in
diversification rates along the phylogeny or a gradual
change in diversification rate throughout the phylogeny
as a whole. In addition, the topological method could not
determine whether the shift or shifts were net increases or
decreases in diversification rate. This lack of information
is due to limitations of the topological method stemming
from the fact that it relies solely on the order of branching
events as opposed to the timing of branching events. The
greater power of BDL, a temporal method, found two
shifts in net diversification rate along the phylogeny.
According to diversification rates suggested by the
yule3rate model and BDL, NAm Psoraleeae diversification
rates shifted dramatically with a net increase from 0.35 to
0.96 speciation events per million years approximately 2
mya. The increased rate is one of the fastest diversification
rates published to date, rivaling those of ice plants in
South Africa [48] and the Andean radiation of Lupinus [7].
The increase in net diversification rate did indeed occur at
mid-depth in the phylogeny and represents a large
increase in the diversification of the tribe within North
America. The concordance of dates between the divergence date and BDL analyses confirms that the diversification rate shift took place as the main radiation of
Pediomelum (subgenera Disarticulatum and Pediomelum),
began diversifying around 2 mya (Figure 1, Table 2).
In addition to a net increase, analyses also provide evidence for a net decrease in diversification rate from 0.96
to 0.11 speciation events per million years around
440,000 years ago. This rate is far lower than the previous
rates, suggesting a decrease in the amount of speciation or
an increase in the amount of extinction or both. The low
speciation rate seen at this recent time point could reprePage 7 of 13

BMC Biology 2008, 6:55

sent the speciation/population boundary. Diversification
from this point forward to the present could be seen as
existing on a population-level scale, as genetic differentiation between populations not sufficiently diverged to be
distinguished as species. Furthermore, this decrease in
diversification rate may be indirectly influenced by recent
events, including those of anthropogenic origin. Indeed,
we know for certain that human influence has been the
cause of extinction within NAm Psoraleeae: Orbexilum
stipulatum, once endemic to Rock Island, Kentucky, at
Falls of the Ohio River, is confirmed extinct after the
island was destroyed for construction of a dam; Orbexilum
macrophyllum was collected from a single site in North
Carolina and is presumed extinct [49]. Still other species
are severely threatened, such as Pediomelum pentaphyllum
and P. humile, due to the elimination of extant populations through urban development, leaving only one or
two known populations alive. Estimates of more recent
diversification shifts are especially dependent on the
number of extant species. If the number of species is
depleted through recent events such as human influence
or through the lack of species recognition, it will more
likely be reflected in diversification rate shifts taking place
at more recent times, this due to the fact that we are estimating the diversification rate based on the number of
species, instead of the number of clades.
Diversification shifts â causes?
Uneven diversification is evident in both taxonomic and
geographical realms, exemplified in the ideas of species
richness and the latitudinal diversity gradient. A great
number of hypotheses have been proposed as explanations for uneven diversification with many centering on
key innovations or climate. While the pattern of the latitudinal diversity gradient, meaning the existence of
greater species numbers centered around lower latitudes,
is well documented, the mechanism(s) behind the phenomenon is unclear, leading to a plethora of hypotheses
[11]. It is possible and even probable that no single
hypothesis can explain such patterns [50]. Furthermore,
these and other patterns could be the results of purely stochastic processes. However, evidence has shown that climatic factors are especially influential on the evolutionary
history of many organismal groups (see below). As NAm
Psoraleeae is within temporal and geographical range of
Quaternary climate oscillations and exhibits a wide variety of climate-based habitats, we chose to address hypotheses involving climate change as possible effectors of
diversification rate shifts.
Habitat shifts
Past climate change has impacted current climate regimes,
creating a spectrum of climate-based habitats across the
earth. Movement of ancestral species from one habitat to
another may also have spurred diversification, relegating

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/55

climate-based habitat as a key innovation. Climate regime
shifts have been found to have impacted diversification
across various organismal groups, including plants [51]
and lizards [52,53]. Hoita, Orbexilum, and Rupertia all
reside in more mesic environments characterized by
warm, moist, humid climates whereas Psoralidium and
Pediomelum reside in more xeric habitats characterized by
hot, dry environments such as the deserts of the Intermountain and Southwest United States (see Figure 1). In
testing habitat shifts from mesic to xeric habitats, our
analyses suggest that past climate change affected diversification rates in NAm Psoraleeae more than shifts in
present climate regimes as defined by current habitats.
The shift to xeric habitats was not considered a key innovation in terms of increasing diversification rates within
the group. Instead, current habitats could be seen as relicts
from the effects of past climate change on its influence on
the diversification of North American Psoraleeae.
Quaternary climate oscillations
The recent origin of the main radiation of Pediomelum
around 2 mya places its diversification in the middle of
the Pleistocene epoch of the Quaternary era, a time period
replete with dramatic glaciation-induced climate oscillations. These glacial fluxes include Milankovitch cycles
which consist of repeated formation and recession of glacial ice sheets having periodicities of 20,000 to 100,000
years, resulting in wide-ranging climate fluxes [33]. It has
been well documented that much of the Earth's biodiversity and many species' evolutionary trajectories were drastically influenced by the climate fluxes brought on by
Quaternary glaciations (for example, [36,37,39,54]). In
North America, the sheer presence of ice sheets shifted climates and strongly influenced the range and distribution
of species [55]. Ice formation may have influenced speciation via genetic differentiation through range fragmentations such as glacial refugia. Upon glacial recession, new
environments were formed and subsequently colonized
through species expansion and adaptation [31,32]. Given
the geographical and temporal distribution of NAm Psoraleeae, these cycles may have influenced its evolutionary
history. Indeed, the shift point for the increase in diversification along the phylogeny at 2 mya and the lineage
through time plot from our analyses support the hypothesis that Quaternary climate fluxes, occurring between 2.5
and 0.8 mya, influenced the diversification of NAm Psoraleeae.
Geography
The effects of these oscillations are not homogenous,
however. The Quaternary ice ages and climate oscillations
affected geographic regions across North America differently. The Southeast provided several refugia in which
species could survive [31] while the montane regions of
the West were characterized by more varied environments

Page 8 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2008, 6:55

such as ice, tundra, pluvial lakes, and deserts [56]. In addition, elevation played an important role in species distributions as elevational ranges of plants were 600 to 1200+
meters below modern ranges, an effect felt more readily in
the topographically diverse regions of the West [57].
Upon glacial recession, the Intermountain West offered a
greater variety of habitats for colonization and adaptation
as a result of topography. This is in line with Cracraft's
lithospheric complexity hypothesis, stating that geographic separation spurred by topographical changes promotes speciation [58]. In addition to orogeny, glacial
cycles contributed to topographical change, and thus are
linked with the lithospheric hypothesis.
Geographical trends are seen in the diversity of Psoraleeae. NAm Psoraleeae ranges throughout the United
States: Orbexilum is mostly confined to the southeast
United States, with one species reaching into Mexico, Pediomelum is mostly found in central and Intermountain
states, Hoita is endemic to California, Rupertia ranges
along the West Coast, and Psoralidium is spread over the
great plains with one species endemic to Utah. Of interest
is the seeming correlation of lineage age with southerly
distribution. Orbexilum is one of the oldest NAm Psoraleeae genera, diversifying earlier than most other lineages. This could be demonstrative of long-established
ranges of Orbexilum through Pleistocene refugia in the
Southeast United States. Of import also is the age of Pediomelum as a whole, beginning its diversification around 3
mya with the break off of subgenus Leucocraspedon. The
two Leucocraspedon species exhibit the most southern distribution of all Pediomelum species with P. rhombifolium
being distributed throughout Texas and into Mexico while
P. palmeri is almost exclusively found in Mesoamerica.
This southern distribution perhaps allowed this lineage to
persist through the Quaternary climate oscillations as the
effects of glacial climate change were moderated toward
the equator. The main radiation of Pediomelum exhibits
the greatest number of species with the lowest intraspecific variation, findings in accord with the lithospheric
complexity hypothesis, geographic separation, ecological
diversification due to habitat diversity, and range fragmentation brought on by Quaternary climate shifts. The
pattern of less diversity in the Southeast (as evidenced by
Orbexilum) and greater diversity in the Southwest (as evidenced by Pediomelum) is also found in Cicindela beetles
[59] and Agelenopsis spiders [60], among others.

Conclusion
NAm Psoraleeae has proved useful for studying evolutionary divergence and the impact of climate change on diversification within a recent, rapid radiation. This work
effectively demonstrates differential rates of diversification at the species and generic levels, trends manifested
across taxonomic levels within Fabaceae. An estimation of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/55

divergence dates within Psoraleeae found that the main
radiation of Pediomelum, comprising the bulk of species
richness in NAm Psoraleeae, originated 1 to 2 mya during
the Quaternary era, concurrent with the Milankovitch climate oscillations brought on by glacial cycles. The
hypothesis of a diversification rate shift in NAm Psoraleeae was confirmed by both topological and temporal
methods. We demonstrated a large increase in diversification rate near the beginning of the Pleistocene epoch. Our
findings suggest that the diversification rate increase in
NAm Psoraleeae is not due to current climate regimes as
represented by habitat, but rather imply that Quaternary
climate oscillations impacted the diversification of the
group. We show nonrandom spatial diversification as
well, with higher species diversity in the American Southwest.
NAm Psoraleeae diversification is a good example of how
earthly dynamics including global climate change and
topography work together to shape biodiversity. In a time
when the issue of global climate change pervades society
and science, this study aptly illustrates the control that
global climate change can have over the evolutionary trajectories and fates of lineages and species.

Methods
Taxon sampling and DNA sequences
This study includes a thorough sampling of NAm Psoraleeae,
with only four of 47 recognized NAm Psoraleeae taxa
unsampled. Of these, Hoita strobilina is critically endangered,
Orbexilum macrophyllum and O. stipulatum are presumed
extinct, and Pediomelum latestipulatum var. latestipulatum was
not collected. In addition to North American taxa, representatives of Otholobium, Cullen, and Bituminaria are included for
estimating the dates of divergence within the tribe. Six outgroup taxa are incorporated for calibration: Abrus precatorius,
Phaseolus vulgaris, Desmodium floridanum, Glycine microphylla,
G. canescens, and G. max cv. Essex. In total, 54 taxa are
included as described in Egan and Crandall [9].

All phylogenetic analyses were based on eight DNA regions:
the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and a single-copy gene,
Granule Bound Starch Synthase I (Waxy) from the nuclear
genome and the trnL-trnF, trnD-trnT, trnS-trnG and rpoB-trnC
intergenic spacers, the trnK intron regions, and the matK protein-coding gene from the chloroplast genome. DNA isolations, primer specifications, PCR amplification, DNA
sequencing, voucher specimen information, GenBank numbers, and maximum parsimony phylogenetic analyses are
described in Egan and Crandall [9].
Divergence dates
Departure from a molecular clock was determined using
likelihood ratio tests with scores estimated using rate-constant and rate-variable models [61] in PAUP* 4.0 [62].

Page 9 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2008, 6:55

Models were estimated as described in Egan and Crandall
[9] using ModelTest 3.7 [63]; matK, trnK, trnD-trnT, rpoBtrnC, ITS, and the combined data set used the general time
reversible (GTR) model plus proportion of invariable sites
(I) and the gamma distribution (G) to account for rate
heterogeneity, trnL-trnF used GTR+I, trnS-trnG used
GTR+G, and waxy used HKY+G.
Divergence dates were estimated for individual genes and
a combined total evidence dataset via Bayesian MCMC
sampling conducted in BEAST v1.4.7 [64] under a relaxed
clock model with log-normally distributed, uncorrelated
rates of substitution between branches [65]. No topological constraints were employed, allowing topological
uncertainty to be taken into account. We analyzed each of
the eight DNA regions individually and the combined
total evidence dataset, allowing the investigation of how
rates of molecular evolution vary among DNA regions.
Two calibration points were used for estimating divergence dates in BEAST: the most recent common ancestor
of Glycine and Phaseolus has a mean estimate of 19.2 mya
accompanied by a standard deviation (SD) of 1.4 mya.
The minimum and maximum age estimates for this node
are 15.5 to 22.4 mya. The most recent common ancestor
of Cullen and Rupertia was estimated to range between 4.1
to 8.8 mya with a mean date of 6.3 mya (0.9 SD). These
dates were estimated from a family-wide divergence date
analysis using penalized likelihood in r8s using Bayesianinferred phylogenies for matK and based on 13 fossil calibration points [5]. We chose to use their matK date estimates over rbcL because the matK dataset incorporated
more fossil calibration points (13 as opposed to 9) and
the estimate of dates was more stable in the matK dataset
as shown by a lower SD. We incorporated these dates as
calibration points into our BEAST analyses by the use of a
normal prior using their respective mean and SD estimates. This strategy allows uncertainty surrounding these
dates as calibration points to be accounted for in our
divergence date analyses.
Each gene or data set used the model of evolution determined by ModelTest mentioned above. The combined
dataset incorporated mixed models into the analysis,
allowing each gene to evolve under the model and parameters best suited to the gene region. The tree prior was
modeled under the Yule speciation process. With the
exception of the normally-distributed priors on calibration points, all other priors were set as default values in
the program BEAUti v1.4.7 which was used to help create
the XML files for input to BEAST [64]. Final analyses consisted of two separate MCMC runs of 5 to 10 million generations sampled every 1000 generations for the
individual gene analyses, while the combined dataset was
run for 15 million generations. Tracer v1.4 [66] was used

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/55

to confirm likelihood stationary and adequate mixing of
the MCMC chains and whether the two separate runs had
converged to the same results. If runs had converged,
results of both runs were combined using LogCombiner
v1.4.7 [64]. Tracer v1.4 was then used to determine adequate burn-in (10%), confirm mixing and stationarity of
the combined runs, and summarize the posterior distribution for divergence date estimates across key nodes. The
maximum clade credibility tree was computed for the
combined dataset using TreeAnnotator v.1.4.7, part of the
BEAST software package.
Differential diversification rates
Two methodological strategies exist for estimating differential diversification rates across phylogenies: comparisons of topological species distribution to a random
distribution of diversity; and comparisons of temporal
distribution of divergence events to a randomly created
distribution [67]. Topological methods are generally
employed as a first test to determine if diversification rate
shifts exist across lineages, while temporal methods are
more powerful at addressing specific questions of when,
how much, and where shifts in diversification took place
along a phylogeny. Here, we employ both strategies to test
both general and specific hypotheses concerning diversification rates.

The topological program SymmeTREE [68] was used to
test the general hypothesis of variation in diversification
rates across NAm Psoraleeae. This tests for deviations of
observed topological distribution of species diversity to
that expected under the Yule model [69] of an equal-rates
Markov random-branching process. Seven whole-tree
tests of differential diversification rates, each sensitive to
different scenarios and nodal depths, are employed. MR
tests for diversification at deeper nodes, or at the root of
the tree, by determining if the observed trees are more or
less asymmetric than expected [70]. IC is similar but is a
calculated measure instead of a probability [70]. MÎ  and
MÎ£ consider the asymmetry of internal nodes, with MÎ 
more sensitive to deeper nodes through multiplication of
individual node probabilities and MÎ£ more sensitive to
nodes closer to the tips of the tree through addition of
node probabilities. MÎ * and MÎ£* vary from the above by
having each node probability weighted by its size [71].
Unlike the above tests, B1 measures tree balance as
opposed to imbalance. This statistic is sensitive to changes
at the tips of the tree as it excludes the root [72]. As a topological method, SymmeTREE does not make use of
branch length data, but uses order of branching events
only. For the SymmeTREE analysis, we therefore used the
previously estimated set of 12 fully resolved, most parsimonious trees from the total evidence maximum parsimony analysis that included gaps [9]. This allowed us the
benefit of completely resolved trees and incorporation of

a measure of phylogenetic uncertainty while avoiding the
duplication of exact topologies that may be evident in the
set of trees from the Bayesian posterior distribution. Bonferroni corrections were used to adjust significance thresholds across multiple tests.
The temporal method BDL was used to test specific
hypotheses of diversification rate shifts [39,53]. This
method calculates maximum likelihood estimates of speciation rate parameters and a likelihood score per tree. The
null model of rate-constancy is tested against rate-variable
models using the Akaike Information Criterion [73]. BDL
has been found to perform as well or better than the popular Î³-statistic, which only identifies temporal decreases in
diversification [74], and has greater power to detect shifts
in diversification rates in the presence of extinction [53].
By comparing the sum of the likelihood of internode distances across the tree under varying models, BDL can decipher between increased diversification rate vs. rateconstancy with background extinction [53]. Several diversification models were tested using LASER [75]. Rate-constant models included pureBirth, a constant speciation
model (Yule) with zero extinction [69] and birth-death
(BD), a constant speciation-constant extinction model
[76]. Rate-variable models include density-dependent
speciation models with exponential (DDX) and logistic
(DDL) variants [77,78], yule2rate and yule3rate models.
The yule2rate and yule3rate models are multi-rate variants
of the Yule model, allowing two and three shifts in speciation rates respectively at times st across a tree. Branching
times only were allowed as possible rate shift points. We
used the maximum clade credibility tree from the combined dataset estimated in BEAST (chronogram shown in
Figure 1) to test for diversification shifts using BDL. This
chronogram was chosen in part due to the need for complete resolution and also to make use of divergence date
estimates based on the full dataset. Outgroups were
excised and the root, the ancestor of Hoita and Pediomelum, scaled to 5.8 mya â the divergence date estimated in
BEAST based on the combined dataset (see Figure 1). Significance of the change in Akaike Information Criterion
(AIC) scores was determined by creating a distribution of
AIC scores. This was done by simulating 1000 trees using
yuleSim in LASER having the same number of taxa and
the same speciation rate as that estimated under the pureBirth model.
Testing of macroevolutionary hypotheses
The factors that we tested as influencing the tempo of
diversification in NAm Psoraleeae include Quaternary climate changes and shifts in climate regime from moist,
warm climes (mesic) to dry, hot climes (xeric). The adaptation to or colonization of xeric environments was
hypothesized as a key innovation, a trait or character
change whose origin may have spurred diversification.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/55

Pediomelum and Psoralidium live in xeric environments
while other NAm Psoraleeae are in more mesic habitats.
Xeric environment was tested to see if its origin was associated with increased diversification in NAm Psoraleeae
against the null hypothesis of no increase in diversification rates across the tribe. We used the key innovation test
[79] which employs Bayesian techniques to assess correlations between the timing of branching events (representative of speciation) and the evolutionary history of the
character of interest. If acting as a key innovation, lineages
with the new regime will have shorter waiting times
before branching, as represented by internode length,
than those without it. Tree length is calibrated to equal the
total amount of change in the character over the whole
phylogeny, such that waiting times represent the relative
time spent in one character state as opposed to the other.
Significance is determined by comparison to a null distribution of random waiting times between branching
events. This goes beyond clade size methods by incorporating the time of branching events and allowing the trait
to be both acquired and lost. Other tests assume acquisition only, not allowing loss of the trait, thereby excluding
potential information from the analysis [79]. We used a
set comprising the last 1000 trees from the Bayesian
(BEAST) posterior distribution based on the combined
dataset to test the hypothesis of xeric environment acting
as a key innovation. This treeset was optimal for this analysis because the trees were already ultrametric and
allowed incorporation of phylogenetic uncertainty. Trees
were scaled so that the total tree length was equal to total
character change from mesic to xeric habitats. In this case
the tree length was 2, illustrating two changes from mesic
to xeric environment at the base of the lineages leading to
Psoralidium and Pediomelum (see Figure 1).
The impacts of Quaternary climate shifts were tested using
lineage-through-time plots [39] and BDL using LASER.
These used the maximum clade credibility chronogram
from the combined dataset estimated in BEAST. A shift in
diversification rates taken between 2.5 and 0.8 mya, the
time of Quaternary climate oscillations, is taken as support for their influence on diversification in this group.
