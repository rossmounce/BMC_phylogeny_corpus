Abstract
Background: Physarum polycephalum, an acellular plasmodial species belongs to the amoebozoa, a
major branch in eukaryote evolution. Its complex life cycle and rich cell biology is reflected in more
than 2500 publications on various aspects of its biochemistry, developmental biology, cytoskeleton,
and cell motility. It now can be genetically manipulated, opening up the possibility of targeted
functional analysis in this organism.
Methods: Here we describe a large fraction of the transcribed genes by sequencing a cDNA library
from the plasmodial stage of the developmental cycle.
Results: In addition to the genes for the basic metabolism we found an unexpected large number
of genes involved in sophisticated signaling networks and identified potential receptors for
environmental signals such as light. In accordance with the various developmental options of the
plasmodial cell we found that many P. polycephalum genes are alternatively spliced. Using 30 donor
and 30 acceptor sites we determined the splicing signatures of this species.
Comparisons to various other organisms including Dictyostelium, the closest relative, revealed that
roughly half of the transcribed genes have no detectable counterpart, thus potentially defining
species specific adaptations. On the other hand, we found highly conserved proteins, which are
maintained in the metazoan lineage, but absent in D. discoideum or plants. These genes arose
possibly in the last common ancestor of Amoebozoa and Metazoa but were lost in D. discoideum.
Conclusion: This work provides an analysis of up to half of the protein coding genes of Physarum
polycephalum. The definition of splice motifs together with the description of alternatively spliced
genes will provide a valuable resource for the ongoing genome project.

Background
Analysis of cellular states under well-defined conditions
can be performed on different levels. One important

method is the generation of expressed sequence tags
(ESTs), short informative sequences generated from
mRNAs of the cell. The ESTs provide a snapshot of the

transcriptome and the conditioned capabilities in the
investigated cell state. Moreover, ESTs are a resource for
the annotation and further analysis of genome sequences
in the respective organism, since they identify transcribed
loci within the genome. Comparisons to genome or EST
sequences of related organisms are then used to elucidate
the functional capabilities of an evolutionary branch.
Many genomes and transcriptomes are currently characterized and more will follow in the future [1]. Typically,
only key species in each branch, so-called model organisms, are submitted to a full genome analysis and further
studies from a global point of view [2]. Initially, model
organisms were chosen according to the following criteria:
i) being the best studied species on an evolutionary
branch ii) having a short life cycle, iii) being cost effective
to maintain, iv)having the potential to be manipulated. In
the animal kingdom prominent models include Drosophila for insects, C. elegans for primitive metazoans, and
mouse for mammals. Accordingly, in the plant and fungi
kingdom there are also well defined model organisms
[3,4]. Yet, model organisms can not fully describe and
represent a whole evolutionary branch. Since models are
real species and therefore have suffered from specializing
adaptations for their specific ecological niche, more than
one model within one evolutionary branch should be
taken in account [5,6]. Furthermore, the more genomes
that are known in a certain evolutionary branch, the more
is known of the branch characteristics. Thus, the comparison of multiple species within an evolutionary branch is
becoming more and more common. Helpfully, analysis of
each subsequent genome within the same evolutionary
branch is easier. Currently the best-surveyed eukaryote
kingdom of life from a genomics perspective is that of the
fungi [4]. Metazoa and green plants are also represented
with several complete or nearly completely sequenced
genomes [1].
Protists as a non-taxonomic unit have great genomic and
phenotypic diversity. The position of specific protist
branches in the phylogenetic tree of life is often unsure, if
not controversial. Complete genome sequences can help
to resolve even deeply branching phyla. From one branch
of protists, the amoebozoa, we currently have full
sequence information of two species, namely Dictyostelium discoideum [7] and Entamoeba histolytica [8]. This
branch is now generally accepted as a major kingdom
within the eukaryotes in addition to fungi, plants, and
animals [7,9,10]. While D. discoideum possesses the main
aspects of a model organism, obligate parasites like E. histolytica are of limited use for the intended description of
evolutionary trends, since they very often have lost genetic
information due to their adaptation to a host. Thus, the
full width of this evolutionary branch can only be
described if free living, relatively distantly related organ-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/6

isms, are compared. The free living amoebozoon
Physarum polycephalum is best suited to characterize the
functional capacities of this evolutionary branch further.
Currently a project targeting the whole genome of this
organism is underway at the Genome Sequencing Center
of Washington University [11]. We complemented this
approach by generating expressed sequence tags (ESTs)
from protein-encoding loci of this species. Here we
describe the analysis of these ESTs.
P. polycephalum SCHWEINITZ is an acellular slime mould
(Myxomycetales) with a complex life cycle. Under favorable
conditions, mononucleate haploid Physarum amoebae
hatch from mature spores. These myxamoebae feed on
bacteria and multiply by cell division with an open mitosis during which the nuclear envelope disaggregates [12].
At high population density two amoebae of compatible
mating types may mate to form a mononucleate diploid
zygote [13]. The zygote develops into a diploid multinucleate plasmodium since the plasmodial cell does not
divide, while nuclear divisions continually occur as the
cell grows. Closed mitosis by division of plasmodial
nuclei is often found in protists [14] while open mitosis
as it occurs in the amoebal stage is typical for higher
eukaryotes. A plasmodium grows as long as nutrition is
available, resulting in a macroscopic mass containing millions of nuclei which all are synchronous with respect to
cell cycle and development [15]. Despite their unlimited
capability for growth and nuclear division, plasmodia can
enter two alternative developmental pathways (spherulation or sporulation) depending on environmental conditions and cell size [15]. When a big mature plasmodium
(macro-plasmodium) starves, it develops the competence
to sporulate. Sporulation of a competent plasmodium is
finally triggered by visible light and/or elevated temperature ([15-17], and references therein). During sporulation
the entire protoplasmic mass develops into fruiting bodies. In sporangia, haploid mononucleate spores are
formed by meiotic cleavage of the plasmodial mass.
For our analysis of the transcriptome of P. polycephalum we
used this sporulation- competent state. Since the cells in
this state still have all options of growth and development, we expected that vegetative specific genes would be
only slightly reduced and that additional factors needed
to progress to the commitment point would also be
expressed. Using this method we can find more genes
than either in the vegetative or committed state.

Results
Generation and clustering of ESTs
In total 15,680 directionally cloned cDNAs were
sequenced from the 5' to the 3' end of the corresponding
mRNA resulting in 5856 contigs after clustering (Table 1;
accession numbers [dbEST: EL563888 to EL579567]).

Since the sequences were all generated from the 5' end of
the corresponding mRNA and the library was enriched for
long inserts, each contig should represent a single gene.
Transcripts from very recent gene duplications could not
be discriminated if no single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) were present in overlapping regions. The mean
coverage of each contig is 2.4 with less than half of the
contigs represented by only one sequence read. The most
abundant transcript in the library codes for a non-transporter ABC protein of which the exact function is not
known. The relatively low sequencing depth shows that
the normalization procedure was successful.
Similarity of EST contigs to other organisms
Based on BLAST analysis, 3282 of the 5856 potential
genes had detectable similarities to entries of a database
containing all currently available sequences (TrEMBL).
Obviously, not all similarities found must indicate true
orthologous relations, since the EST information does not
always cover the whole gene. Yet, due to the partial nature
of the gene information in EST data it is also not feasible
to introduce a score cutoff to get only reliable information. The closest free-living relative, of which the whole
genome is known, is D. discoideum. We conducted a search
for similarities to protein coding genes in this genome and

found that 2387 of our contigs matched at least partially
to D. discoideum proteins indicating a relationship
between the matching pairs. Surprisingly, we found 895
contigs with similarities to entries in other databases but
not in the D. discoideum protein database. This can be
partly due to false positive matches, but some identified
proteins hint at a scenario where D. discoideum has lost the
respective gene as was shown previously for some genes
(see below) [18].
We also analysed, which evolutionary branches contained
genes with similarities to our contig sequences. For this
purpose we used sequence databases representing only
certain parts of the evolutionary tree (see Materials and
Methods). As with the screen in the complete sequence
database TrEMBL we initially did not limit the BLAST output by using a restricting threshold. Matches were then
assigned to subgroups to give information on the phylogenetic distribution of the best matching proteins. In
Table 2 the results are compiled for the listed categories.
Since spurious hits may limit the value of the analysis, we
introduced a score threshold of 150 in a second round of
analysis (Table 2; numbers in brackets). The number of
contigs without any hit to known genes increases slightly
when we use this threshold, but the overall distribution of
database matches remains the same, indicating that the
values given are generally applicable.
Next, we searched for genes, which are present in vertebrates, but cannot be detected in D. discoideum, invertebrates, or plants. Presumably, these proteins evolved
before the split of the the amoebozoa from the eukaryote/
fungi kingdoms but were lost individually in invertebrates
and in D. discoideum. In Table 3 and Additional file 1, the
best matching contigs to vertebrate database entries can
be found.

calculated using a blastx threshold score of 150.

Domain distributions, pathway analysis, and signal
transduction
The Kyoto Enzyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
is a valuable resource to evaluate the presence or absence
of pathways. Despite the incomplete nature of EST
sequence data, we were able to identify most components
of the basic metabolism by using the KAAS server from the
KEGG database. For example, we found the transcripts of
19 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Two transcripts for phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase are present, while the transcripts for histidyl- and valinyl-tRNA synthetase are
missing in our data set. Furthermore, the transcription
and translation machineries as well as the replication and
repair components are nearly completely represented in
our dataset. This is consistent with the previous finding
that protein synthesis and nuclear divisions still occur in
the starving, competent plasmodium, although the cytoplasmic mass continually decreases [19]. Certainly, protein synthesis depends on intact metabolic pathways.
Except for malate dehydrogenase, the enzymes of the citric
acid cycle were represented at the RNA level.

Many components of the wnt, MAPK, notch, Calcium,
and phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways are present
in our data set. Also represented were the transcripts of
genes involved in the regulation of the cytoskeleton or cell
cycle progression [see Additional file 2].

4492 entries by only counting one frame. Visual inspection showed that in most cases the additional hits on
other frames were the same as in the counted frame indicating sequencing errors that caused a frame shift. The
remaining entries were grouped according to their
involvement in different cellular processes (Fig. 1). The
sizeable proportion of genes expressed for the generation
and maintenance of signal transduction chains indicates
that this seems to be a major task of the starving plasmodium. In addition, genes for transport processes and the
cytoskeleton play a significant role at least under these
conditions.
We found 490 contigs that had no similarity to any database searched using BLAST but contained an Interpro
domain. This number nearly doubles (829) if we apply a
threshold score of 150. Not surprisingly most of the
detected domains are relatively short domains involved in
protein-protein interactions.
The physiological state from which the mRNA for library
construction was obtained can be described as a stand-by
position where the cell waits for environmental input. We

To check whether P. polycephalum uses additional main
pathways compared to D. discoideum we queried the
KEGG database again using only those contigs without a
match to D. discoideum genes. All contigs classified by
KEGG also have a D. discoideum counterpart (not shown).
The scan against Interpro domains yielded 11091 potential domains in all 6 frames in the raw output [see Additional file 3]. A total of 2914 contigs contain at least a part
of an Interpro domain [see Additional file 1]. To avoid
redundancies caused by potential sequencing errors
resulting in frame shifts this raw list was then reduced to

therefore searched specifically for domains forming receptor structures or involved in receptor functions. In 27 of
our contigs we found these domains (Table 4). Since
receptors are often present in genomes as large families
[20-22] the specific trigger for a certain receptor molecule
cannot be inferred from sequence analysis alone. Three
contigs encode proteins of the photolyase family. All photolyases sense light and some family members are known
to function as receptors for certain light qualities [23,24].
One of these potential receptors [dbEST:EL577394] is
most closely related to fungal proteins, but the function of
these proteins is still unknown (Fig 2). The other two family members cluster together with class II CPD photolyases, which are involved in UV damage repair processes

[25]. Possibly, one of these light sensing molecules is the
activator of a signal transduction chain inducing sporulation.
Alternative splicing
The clustering of the single ESTs to contigs revealed that
there were many sequences with identical sections but
that could not be put together in one contig without introducing gaps in the alignment. We concluded that the corresponding mRNAs were transcribed from the same locus
on the genome but differentially processed. This alternative splicing of transcripts is a common feature for all
Eukaryotes, but the extent of transcript diversification varies between species [26]. We determined the number of

alternatively spliced loci by clustering the ESTs irrespective
of whether gaps were created in the alignment. Example
alignments of alternatively spliced ESTs are shown in
additional file 4. With this method 529 potential alternatively spliced messages were constructed comprising 9 %
of all clusters. Further analysis revealed that alternative
splicing affects genes regardless of their phylogenetic similarities, since no significant differences were found
between phylogenetic categories using the χ2 test. We tried
to find genes, which can be alternatively spliced in P.
polycephalum as well as in D. discoideum, the closest relative. This is perhaps unlikely as there are only 18 known
alternatively spliced genes in D. discoideum [27]. A comparison with these genes revealed no gene alternatively
spliced in both organisms.
Several alternatively spliced transcripts were of the intron
retention type as could be deduced from potential splice
sites at the border of the longer alternative transcript.
Those introns are normally relatively short and rare in
humans but widespread in Arabidopsis [28,29]. We tried
to resolve the genomic structure of some of the alternatively spliced transcripts. For this purpose we chose 25
alternatively spliced contigs randomly and designed primers for an amplification of the known part of the genes
from genomic DNA. Nine out of 25 amplification
attempts were successful, i.e. gave products, which could
be subsequently sequenced. The low success rate is possibly due to wrong placement of oligos for PCR on the EST
sequences since we did not know whether and where

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/6

introns were present in the gene loci. The alignment of the
resulting genomic sequences to their corresponding transcript counterparts revealed that all ESTs were correctly
clustered despite the differential splicing. We could determine all donors and acceptors from 32 introns [see Additional file 5]. Of these 32 introns, 13 introns were not
spliced out in a part of the ESTs, thus comprising the
number of intron retentions via alternative splicing. Nine
introns had alternative donors or acceptors, and 10
introns were not affected by alternative splicing, i.e. all
ESTs lost the respective intron. In one case we identified a
small additional exon in a transcript, which otherwise is
considered as intron part and skipped. The longest
defined spliced intron comprises 994 bases. Interestingly,
935 bases of this intron are A or G nucleotides (94 %),
whereas in the second largest intron in this gene 92 % are
C and T nucleotides [see Additional file 5]. Thus, intron
base composition can be very diverse even in only one
gene. Two of the fully spliced introns represented U12
dependent introns, thus confirming that this type of
intron is present in all evolutionary branches.
We aligned all our U2 dependent donor and acceptor sites
(30 each) to calculate the consensus splice motifs. In Fig.
3, donor and acceptor consensi are shown as weighted
base probabilities [30]. Interestingly, as in D. discoideum,
the splice site consensi do not extend far from the canonical GT-AG motif, neither into intronic nor exonic regions,
contrary to splice site motifs in animals and plants. A
slight preference for pyrimidines can be found at the

acceptor site, and at the intron side of the donor, A and T
are preferred at the second and third position after the
splice site. This resembles the situation in D. discoideum.

Discussion
Genomic differences within the Amoebozoa
One of our goals was to investigate the common capabilities within the amoebozoan evolutionary branch, and 41
% of all contigs could be assigned to related proteins of D.
discoideum. That this matching percentage is not higher
might be due to several different possible reasons: i) EST
contigs represent only a fraction of the whole gene ii) D.
discoideum has a high nucleotide bias that also influences
amino acid usage possibly obscuring protein-protein relationships iii) The evolutionary distance of the two species
is large, thus evolutionary specializations account for the
observed differences.

More surprising is the observation of nearly 1000 contigs
with more or less conserved counterparts in other
genomes but not D. discoideum. These genes are not
involved in basic pathways as the KEGG Pathway analysis
showed. The corresponding genes could have been lost in
D. discoideum since the separation of the two species.
Another possibility is that these genes evolved faster in D.
discoideum than in other species (see above).
Functional categories and pathway analysis
The starving, competent plasmodium is in an undetermined physiological state in that it has three options of
development: re-enter growth, spherulate or sporulate.
When a competent plasmodium finds a nutrient source, it
re-enters growth, when it is submersed by water, it spherulates or when it is induced by light or heat shock, it
sporulates [15].

Therefore, a starving, competent plasmodium is in a delicate limbo state primed for several options. This state is
destabilized if receptors and signal transduction chains
receive environmental signals. We choose this state for
our analysis, since the cell should generate mRNAs for all
its possible future fates. As a result, it is not surprising that
we could find major signal transduction chains. Yet, what
was unexpected was the percentage of all contigs they represented indicating the presence of a sophisticated signaling network. We also could define potential receptors,
which, upon activation, could be responsible for the
determination of the plasmodial fate (Table 4). One of the
potential light receptors [dbEST:EL577394] obviously
belongs to a family of well conserved proteins, but the
functions of proteins in this specific family tree branch
remain to be determined.
The main metabolic and housekeeping genes are still
expressed in this state. This indicates that at this point in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/6

the life cycle of P. polycephalum, the normal turnover of
material can take place and this might be responsible for
its ability to resume growth instead of committing to
spherulation or sporulation. Whether the transcription
and translation rate is reduced in this specific state
remains to be determined. Since the starving, competent
plasmodium has other choices depending on the environmental signals received, these genes involved in this simple form of cell fate specification are also expected to be
expressed in the plasmodium. However, the exact nature
of them can not be determined from the sequence alone.
Further functional studies have to be performed to define
these components.
Alternative splicing and intron signatures
Levels of alternative splicing differ between organisms.
The best analyzed species are vertebrates, where alternative splicing is thought to contribute to transcriptional
and, consequently, organismal complexity. Yet, even
within vertebrates there are large differences in levels of
alternative splicing [26]. Moreover, alternative splicing is
not well conserved on the gene level, i.e. closely related
species can differ in their splicing patterns in certain genes
[31,32]. P. polycephalum seems to possess, compared to
other lower eukaryotes like dinoflagelates and diatoms,
extensive alternative splicing capacities (own observations). If we compare the nearly 10 percent alternative
splicing events with the only 19 described alternative transcripts in D. discoideum, we find no overlap of alternatively
spliced transcripts in the two amoebozoa. Since the
genome of D. discoideum is with 34 Mb a factor of 10
smaller than that of P. polycephalum with ca. 240 to 300
Mb [33,34], one is tempted to conclude, that the amount
of alternative splicing could be partly positively correlated
to genome size.

The longest intron we detected consists almost exclusively
of A and G nucleotides. If many such introns exist in the
genome, we expect that the assembly of whole genome
shotgun sequences will prove difficult in these regions.
ESTs as a resource for a whole genome project
Lower single-celled eukaryotes contain between 6 and
around 13 thousand protein coding genes as currently
available data show [7,35,36]. The only available species
related to P. polycephalum, D. discoideum, was predicted to
contain around 13,000 genes [7]. The largest protein coding gene repertoire known is currently that of Paramecium
tetraurelia with around 40,000 genes, yet this high number
is due to a recent genome duplication [37]. Even human
genomes do not encode for more than around 20,000
genes [38]. Thus, the number of protein coding genes in
P. polycephalum should be in the same range. We think that
with the nearly 6,000 EST contigs we described parts of at
least 30 % of all genes in P. polycephalum. Sequencing of

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:6

significantly more ESTs would increase the amount of
data only slightly. Accordingly, the remaining 50 % of
genes are expected to be either specifically expressed during other stages of the life cycle or only weakly or both.
This conclusion is supported by the fact that the much
deeper coverage with ESTs (> 150,000; [27]) of the D. discoideum genome was not sufficient to cover most of the
genes. Even this amount of EST data covers less than 70 %
of all predicted genes in D. discoideum. Thus we think that
we have found a large fraction of the genes, which can be
defined using EST data. For the ongoing genome project
for the P. polycephalum genome this is a valuable resource.
It can be used to define transcribed loci even if no similar
counterparts are available in the databases. Additionally,
the splice site patterns found here can be used for the
training of gene finding programs so that the automated
gene prediction can be more reliable. Our finding, that a
considerable part of the transcripts is alternatively spliced
pinpoints the additional problems which could be associated with the gene finding process.

Conclusion
We provide an extensive overview on the transcriptional
activities of a sophisticated acellular system, Physarum
polycephalum in a well defined multi-potential state. The
presence of the primary metabolism demonstrates its not
yet committed state, whereas the presence of various signal transduction chains points at its alertness towards possible environmental changes. The surprisingly high extent
of alternative splicing we observed could reflect an additional power to adapt to changing environments via
slightly changed transcripts.

Methods
Strain and growth of plasmodial cells
Plasmodia of the white strain LU897 × LU898 were
hatched from spherules, grown as micro-plasmodial suspension in liquid shaken culture and the plasmodial mass
was then applied as a ring on 9 cm diameter starvation
agar plates as described [39]. Micro-plasmodia (ca. 1 g
fresh weight on each plate) spontaneously fused to give a
single plasmodium in each plate. Plasmodia were starved
for six days to obtain maximal competence for sporulation. To verify the sporulation-competent physiological
state, plasmodia were cut into two halves. One half was
immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent
extraction of RNA. The other half was returned to the dark
and incubated until the next day to verify that the plasmodium had not been induced to sporulation. Each plasmodium was frozen separately to prevent a potential
contamination of the sample with plasmodia that were
induced or committed to sporulation. The sporulationcompetence of the batch was verified by a control in
which a certain number of the plasmodia were irradiated
for 30 Min with far-red light [40] but otherwise treated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/6

identically. None (0%; n = 98) of the non-irradiated plasmodia and all (100%; n = 66) of the irradiated plasmodia
sporulated. This indicates that the sample was in a homogeneous physiological state and that the analysed RNA
pool was derived from plasmodial cells that were highly
competent for sporulation but were neither induced nor
committed to sporulation.
Library construction and sequencing
Total RNA was isolated from frozen plasmodia using the
RNeasy Kit (Qiagen). PolyA+ RNA preparation, reverse
transcription using an oligo(dT) linker primer, second
strand cDNA synthesis and library construction by ligating the cDNAs into a pBSIISK+ vector via EcoRI and BamHI
sites was performed by vertis Biotechnologie AG (Freising,
Germany). Two libraries were constructed and transformed into competent E. coli cells: library N0 (1920
clones sequenced) and a normalized library (library N1;
13824 clones sequenced). Normalization was performed
by one cycle of denaturation and reassociation of the
cDNAs in order to reduce the representation of highly
abundant transcripts and to enhance the representation of
low abundance transcripts. 83% of the transcripts were
0.8 to 1.6 kb in length. We tested for sequence information saturation by clustering the last 2 × 96 sequences produced with the already clustered sequences (see paragraph
"Clustering"). This procedure showed that only 5 and 7
sequences, respectively, added new clusters to the database. Thus, to get only 10 % more sequence information,
more than a doubling of the EST data would have been
required.

DNA of individual clones was extracted using the magnetic bead technology on a Qiagen robot.
Custom primers and the cycle sequencing method were
used for sequencing. Since sequences generated from the
3' direction (the polymerase synthesizes the polyA tails
before it accesses the informative sequences) are of considerable lower quality than those generated from the 5'
end, we decided to only produce 5'end derived sequences.
The sequencing reaction products were separated on
ABI3700 96 capillary machines. Quality clipping and vector removal was performed using phred.
Clustering
The gap assembler implemented in the Staden package
[41] enabled us to obtain a minimal contig set. Previous
results have shown that an automated clustering alone
does not join all possible overlaps due to accumulating
sequencing errors in the end region of the sequences. This
is particularly the case for contigs with low coverage. Since
the joining of all truly overlapping sequences and disentanglement of wrongly joined sequences is a crucial step
in the analysis of EST data, all contigs were manually

Page 8 of 11
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:6

inspected and edited. In cases where contigs overlapped
with identical sequences but aligned only with introduced
gaps we fused these contigs and treated them as potentially alternatively spliced. Single pass EST sequences are
publicly available via dbEST [dbEST: : EL563888 to
EL579567].
Analysis
The whole data set was tested for contamination by applying blastn against the entire GenBank database with
default values. This analysis revealed that only one single
read had a good similarity on DNA level with already
sequenced genomes [dbEST:EL577893]. Therefore we
conclude that contamination with nucleic acids other
than from P. polycephalum is probably on a very low level.
However, we can not test and exclude that a few reads are
derived from unsequenced genomes.

All sequences were compared as 6-frame translation of
each EST to the protein databases Swissprot (swissprot
version 54) and TrEMBL (uniprot_trembl version 37)
using blastx. Blast parameters used (WUBlast2.0):

Furthermore, we used subdatabases of the refseq database
to pinpoint the potential phylogenetic distribution of
blast matches (refseq protein subdivisions for mammalia,
other vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, protozoa, and
microbes, generated 29th March 2007). According to the
occurring BLAST matches the contigs were binned into
several categories (see table 2). This evolutionary categorization was repeated using a score threshold of 150 for all
databases. The categorization does not take into account
fungi specific gene matches. Thus, genes categorized to
metazoa may also have matches to fungi-specific genes.
Additionally, we created a database of all D. discoideum
proteins and used it to determine the amoebozoa specific
gene complement.
Six-frame translations were used to screen for Interpro
domains [42]. The resulting domains were clustered
according to categories shown in Fig. 1. Pathway analysis
was done querying the KEGG database with the KAAS
server [43].
