Abstract
Background: The homB gene is a Helicobacter pylori disease-marker candidate, strongly associated
with peptic ulcer disease, while homA, its paralogue gene with 90% sequence identity, is correlated
with non-ulcer dyspepsia. The HomB encoded outer membrane protein was shown to contribute
to the proinflammatory properties of H. pylori and also to be involved in bacterial adherence.
This study investigated the distribution of homB and homA genes in 455 H. pylori strains from East
Asian and Western countries, and carried out sequence comparison and phylogenetic analyses.
Results: Both homB and homA genes were heterogeneously distributed worldwide, with a marked
difference between East Asian and Western strains.
Analysis of homB and homA sequences revealed diversity regarding the number of copies and their
genomic localization, with East Asian and Western strains presenting different genotypes.
Moreover, homB and homA sequence analysis suggests regulation by phase variation. It also indicates
possible recombination events, leading to gene duplication or homB/homA conversion which may as
well be implicated in the regulation of these genes. Phylogenetic reconstruction of homB and homA
revealed clustering according to the geographic origin of strains. Allelic diversity in the middle
region of the genes was observed for both homB and homA, although there was no correlation
between any allele and disease. For each gene, a dominant worldwide allele was detected,
suggesting that homB/homA allelic variants were independent of the geographical origin of the
strain. Moreover, all alleles were demonstrated to be expressed in vivo.
Conclusion: Overall, these results suggest that homB and homA genes are good candidates to be
part of the pool of H. pylori OMPs implicated in host-bacteria interface and also contributing to the
generation of antigenic variability, and thus involved in H. pylori persistence.

Background
H. pylori infection is implicated in the development of several gastroduodenal diseases, ranging from chronic active
gastritis and dyspepsia to peptic ulcer disease (PUD), and
associated with an increased risk for gastric cancer [1]. The
virulence of the infecting strain influences the severity of
the clinical outcome, and disease associations have been
proposed for the cag pathogenicity island (PAI), vacA and
several genes encoding outer membrane proteins (OMP)
[2-7]. Indeed, bacterial factors which modulate interactions with human cells, such as OMPs, have been
involved in the pathophysiology of the infection caused
by H. pylori. These proteins can contribute to the colonization and persistence of H. pylori, as well as influence the
disease process [5-7]. PUD usually occurs after a longterm H. pylori infection. However, the disease can develop
earlier, and rare cases have been observed in children, suggesting that the H. pylori strains involved are more virulent.
Recently, a novel virulence-associated OMP-coding gene,
homB, was identified in the genome of a H. pylori strain
isolated from a five-year old child with a duodenal ulcer
[8]. The homB gene was associated with an increased risk
of PUD as well as with the presence of other H. pylori disease-related genes: cagA, babA, vacAs1, hopQI and functional oipA [8-10].
Several H. pylori strains carry a paralogue of homB, the
homA gene, which presents more than 90% identity to
homB [11]. Interestingly, homA was more frequently found
in strains isolated from non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD), and
was associated with the less virulent H. pylori genotypes
i.e. cagA-negative and babA-negative, vacAs2, hopQII and a
non-functional oipA gene [9,10].
Both homB and homA genes can be found as a single or
double-copy in the H. pylori genome, or alternatively a
copy of each gene can be present within a genome, in two
conserved loci [9]. When present as a single copy, the gene
always occupies the HP0710/jhp0649 locus, while when
present as a double-copy, homA and homB occupy indifferently the HP0710/jhp0649 or jhp0870 loci [9], according
to the numbering of the 26695 and J99 strains, respectively [12,13]. Furthermore, among all possible homB and
homA combinations, the genotype the most significantly
associated with PUD was the double-copy of homB, while
a single copy of homA was the genotype the most associated with NUD [9,10].
In vitro studies revealed that the HomB protein is
expressed as an OMP and is antigenic in humans. Moreover, HomB induces activation of interleukin-8 secretion
and is involved in adherence to human gastric epithelial

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/248

cells; these two phenomena being more pronounced in
strains carrying the homB double-copy genotype [9].
Taken together, these data suggest that homB gene is a new
co-marker for H. pylori virulence and that the mechanism
underlying the involvement of HomB in inflammation is
bacterial adherence.
The present study aimed to explore the distribution of
homB and homA genes in different geographical regions.
Moreover, no information on homB and homA allelic variation at the population level is available to date. Thus, to
better understand the diversity and evolution of these two
H. pylori OMP-coding genes, both comparative and phylogenetic sequence analyses were performed, using H.
pylori strains with a different geographical background.

Results
Distribution of homB and homA genes in H. pylori strains
isolated from different countries
The presence of homB and homA genes in the H. pylori clinical strains was determined by a single PCR with a set of
primers designed on a consensus internal sequence
present in both genes, which generates PCR products of
161 bp and 128 bp for homB and homA, respectively. A
PCR product of one of these sizes was obtained for 449
out of 455 strains tested, suggesting that one of these
genes is always present in the H. pylori genome. However,
in six remaining cases, PCR fragments of an intermediate
length were observed (146 bp for four Korean and one
French strain and 152 bp for one Japanese strain), which
does not relate to either the homB or the homA genotype.
Although phylogenetic analysis of these PCR fragments
showed that these particular sequences were closer to
homB gene, those of the discriminating region (from 470
to 690 bp) and the entire gene (GenBank accession numbers EU910189 to EU910194) did not show a higher similarity with either homB or homA, instead the sequences
were grouped by geographic origin (data not shown).
These sequences were excluded from further analysis.

Analysis of the distribution of homB and homA genes in
the H. pylori clinical strains (n = 449) from the different
countries studied revealed that both genes were equally
distributed among Western countries (n = 300, 56.0% for
homB and 60.4% for homA). homA was found slightly
more frequently than homB in strains from Portugal (n =
115, 66.5% vs 49.7%), France (n = 34, 58.9% vs 46.7%),
Sweden (n = 27, 58.6% vs 41.5%), USA (n = 29, 72.4% vs
53.4%) and Brazil (n = 56, 73.4% vs 62.4%), while homB
was more frequently found in strains from Germany (n =
20, 60% vs 45%) and Colombia (n = 19, 67.8% vs
42.8%). Among strains from East Asian countries (n =
138), homB was highly frequent in both Japan and Korea
(n = 71, 95.9% and n = 67, 77.2%, respectively), while

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/248

homA was more rare (5.9% and 21.2%, respectively). In
strains from Burkina Faso (n = 11), both genes were
highly frequent (90.9%).
Diversity of homB and homA genes
Considering the numbering of the J99 strain, the homA
and homB genes are localized at the jhp0649 locus (locus
A) and the jhp0870 locus (locus B), respectively [13]. In
strain 26695, only one copy of the homA gene is present at
locus A [12], and in strain HPAG1, only one copy of the
homB gene is present at locus A [14]. Using PCR primers
located in a conserved region on the flanking genes of
both A and B loci, the entire nucleotide sequence of both
genes was determined for 92 clinical strains, chosen in
order to represent a subgroup of each country (Portugal:

14; France: 7; Sweden, Germany, USA, and Korea: 10 each;
Brazil: 11; Colombia: 9 Japan: 8; and Burkina Faso: 3) and
according to their homB/homA genotype, carrying either
one copy (n = 60) or two copies of homB and/or homA
genes (n = 32). The analysis of 124 sequences, 71 homB
and 53 homA, revealed diversity regarding the number of
copies of each gene and their genomic localization
between East Asian and Western strains (Fig. 1). Concerning the number of copies, strains presented either the single-copy or the double-copy genotype. The single-copy
genotype was more frequently observed than the doublecopy genotype in all European countries studied: Portugal
(9/14 strains), France (5/7), Sweden (8/10) and Germany
(8/10), as well as in Colombia (6/9), Japan (8/8) and
Korea (10/10), and was independent of the clinical origin

of the strains. The presence of two copies within the same
strain was observed in half of the USA (5/10) isolates, and
was more frequent in strains from Brazil (8/11) and
Burkina Faso (3/3).
In the group of clinical strains analysed, homB and homA
genes were always localized in the two loci A and B, occupying indifferently one of the loci when one copy of each
gene was present within the same genome. However, in
the case of a single-copy genotype, the gene was always in
the same genomic position (Fig. 1): locus A in one Korean
strain and in all Western strains, with the exception of
three strains from US citizens of Asian origin; locus B in
those three USA strains and in all Asian strains, except for
the Korean strain. In the case of the single-copy genotype,
the "empty" locus contained a region ranging from 236 to
573 bp with high sequence identity (88-97%) with the 3'
end of both homB and homA genes.
Analysis of the entire nucleotide sequence of both homB
and homA genes revealed a complete open reading frame
(ORF) in 117 of the 124 sequences analyzed (94.4%). The
homB gene size ranged from 1971 to 2013 bp and homA
gene from 1959 to 2004 bp, leading to putative 656-670
and 652-667 residue protein lengths for HomB and
HomA, respectively. With regard to the seven truncated
ORFs, the four out-of-frame homB genes were all from
NUD strains, whereas among the three out-of-frame homA
genes, two were from NUD and one from a gastric cancer
strain. These truncated ORFs were due to the presence of
frameshift mutations leading to premature STOP codons,
occurring in repetitive sequence motifs for three of the
four homB sequences, which was not the case for the three
out-of-frame homA genes. Overall, among the seven truncated cases, only one strain harboured a complete gene at
the second locus, suggesting that neither HomA nor
HomB are expressed in vitro at locus A or B for the six
remaining strains.
Phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of homB and
homA genes
The phylogenetic reconstruction of homB and homA
showed two independent branches for each gene (Fig. 2),
suggesting a divergent evolution. Two predominant clusters corresponding to East Asian and Western countries
were observed for homB gene pointing to a separation by
geographical origin. For homA, the geographical segregation was not evident since this gene is rare in East Asian
countries. Both homB and homA displayed a high similarity at the nucleotide level (92.8% ± 1.82 and 93.7% ±
2.20, respectively) and at the amino acid level (92.8% ±
1.82 and 94.0% ± 2.30, respectively). Furthermore,
together they shared a similarity of 88.6% ± 0.006 at the
nucleotide level and 89.4% ± 0.009 at the amino acid
level.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/248

The molecular distance and the nucleotide substitution
rates, synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) substitutions, were similar for both homB and homA genes, as
well as the mean Ka to mean Ks ratios (Ka/Ks) (Table 1).
The type of selection operating at the amino acid level can
be detected by comparing Ka and Ks [15]. Since Ka/Ks was
less than 1 for both genes, the purifying selection hypothesis was tested and a significant P value obtained supports
the hypothesis of conservation at the protein level (PZ-Test
<0.001).
Analysis of the similarity plot of the 124 nucleotide
sequences of homB and homA genes showed the existence
of three distinct regions in both genes, named segments 1,
2 and 3, corresponding to the 5, middle and 3' regions of
the genes, respectively (Fig. 3). The analysis performed
independently on the three segments of each gene showed
that segment 2 displayed the highest molecular distance
as well as the highest Ka, even when compared to the
entire gene (Table 1). These results were confirmed by the
analysis of the nucleotide substitution rate over a sliding
window, which also showed a significant increase in the
Ka in segment 2 of homB gene. In fact, the mean Ka for this
region (0.191 ± 0.059) was five fold higher than for the
rest of the gene (0.037 ± 0.023). The same result was
observed for homA gene (data not shown). These observations reveal a higher level of diversity of segment 2 in both
genes.
A phylogenetic analysis on each gene segment of 24
strains carrying one copy of each gene was also performed.
The phylogenetic reconstruction of segment 1 showed
that homB presented the highest similarity between
orthologous genes, i.e., each homB was closely related to
the homB in the other strains (Fig. 4A). A similar result was
obtained for homA gene (Fig. 4A). In contrast, for segment
3, each homB was strongly correlated with the corresponding homA present in the same strain, indicating similarity
between paralogous genes (Fig. 4B). The mean molecular
distance and mean synonymous and non-synonymous
substitution rates were calculated for all possible pairs of
paralogous and orthologous genes, within the same strain
and between strains. As expected, for segment 1, molecular distance and mean substitution rates were similar for
pairs of homB and homA sequences in general. In contrast,
for segment 3, these parameters were significantly lower
between homB and homA sequences within the same strain
than among different strains (Table 2). Additionally, for
segment 3, molecular distance and nucleotide substitution rates were similar within each gene and between
genes, indicating a parallel evolution of this segment in
both genes, while for segment 1 those parameters were
higher between genes than within each gene, pointing to
an independent and divergent evolution of this segment
in each gene (Table 3). Analysis of segment 2 was not con-

from approximately 470 to 690 bp allowed the discrimination of homB and homA genes (arrow in Fig. 3). Gene
segment 2, spanning from approximately 750 to 1050 bp
in homB and from 720 to 980 bp in homA, was extremely
polymorphic in both genes, with nucleotide differences
being detected among the two genes and within
sequences of the same gene from different strains (Fig. 3).
This polymorphism is consistent with the highest nucleotide substitution rate observed for this gene segment.

The detailed analysis of the previously mentioned 124
nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of segment 2 of homB and homA genes revealed the existence of
six distinct and well conserved allelic variants, named AI,
AII, AIII, AIV, AV and AVI (Fig. 5). The homB gene exhibited greater allelic diversity than homA gene, with five and
three allelic variants, respectively. Two predominant
allelic variants were observed: allele AI, detected in 78.9%
of the homB sequences and exclusive of this gene, and AII,
observed in 84.9% of homA sequences and in 11.3% of
homB sequences. The four other allelic variants were less
frequent: AIII was present in 4.2% and 11.3% of homB and
homA genes, respectively; AIV was exclusively present in
3.8% of homA genes; and finally AV and AVI were exclusively present in 1.4% and 4.2% of homB, respectively.
Similarity plot analysis of homB and homA allelic
sequences showed that the two predominant allelic variants of each gene, AI and AII, were the most distant groups
(data not shown).

Interestingly, the closest variants to the homB predominant allele AI were the rarest variants AV and AVI, all three

predominant allele AII were AIII and AIV (data not

suggesting that all homB and homA allelic variants are
expressed during infection and are antigenic in humans.
However, it should be noted that only one serum could be
tested for the rarest allelic variants, AIII, AIV, AV and AVI.

Discussion
Concerning the most prevalent homB and homA allele
types, no geographical predominance of any allele was
observed, and no correlation was found between any
allelic variant and gastric disease as well (data not shown).
In order to test the in vivo expression of homB and homA
allelic variants, human sera were tested with a recombinant purified HomB protein, allele type AI [9]. All sera
(n = 24) showed an immunoreaction against this protein,

In the present study, the distribution and diversity of two
putative H. pylori OMP-coding genes, homB and homA,
was evaluated in clinical strains with different geographical origins. Both genes displayed a varied worldwide distribution, with a marked difference between East Asian
and Western countries, in accordance with other studies
reporting such differences in the frequency of H. pylori virulence factors [16-19].

Phylogenetic analysis of (A) segment 1 (nucleotides 1 to 750) and (B) segment 3 (nucleotides 1000 to 2000) for
the pairs of homB and homA genes of 24 Helicobacter pylori strains carrying one copy of each gene. The branch
length index is represented below each tree. Country of origin is located at the beginning of each strain designation (Pt, Portugal; Br, Brazil; Col, Colombia; BF, Burkina Faso) followed by the homB or homA status. In Fig. 4A, the dotted line separates the
homB and homA clusters. The numbers next to the main nodes are bootstrap values over 75% after 1000 iterations.

At least one copy of either homB or homA genes was found
to be present in the genome of the H. pylori strains suggesting that these OMP-coding genes are under selective pressure to be maintained in the bacterium, as was reported
for other H. pylori OMP-coding genes such as babA/babB,
sabA and oipA [5-7]. Analysis of homB and homA genes
revealed diversity regarding the number of copies and
their genomic localization, regardless of the clinical origin
of the strain, but with geographical specificity. Both the
homB/homA single-copy and the double-copy genotypes
were observed in Western strains while the East Asian
strains presented the single-copy genotype only, suggesting that, if gene duplication had occurred, it did not seem
to be a random event.
Variation in copy number of OMP-encoding genes can
help the bacterium adapting to a particular host, which is
essential to promote a chronic infection [5,11,20]. The

fact that homB and homA genes display a high level of similarity, especially at the 5'and 3' ends, suggests that intra or
intergenomic recombination events can occur, leading to
gene duplication, deletion or homB/homA conversion, as a
response to environmental changes. The presence of an
intergenic region at the empty locus with high identity
with both homB and homA suggests that the gene was lost,
leaving short remnant sequences which will enable the
gene to be integrated again by genomic recombination, in
response to environmental changes, as has been hypothesized for other H. pylori genes [21,22].
Analysis of the homB and homA sequences revealed a complete ORF in the majority of the H. pylori strains tested,
truncated genes being detected in only 5.7% of the cases.
Interestingly, in three of the four out-of-frame homB
sequences, the frameshift mutations occurred in short
homopolymeric tracts, suggesting that homB displays

Amino acid alignment of 22 homB and homA allelic region fragments from segment 2 (720 to 1050 bp; predicted amino acids 240 to 350), showing the six allelic variants. The sequence of the homB product of the J99 strain

the reference sequence, the hyphens represent deletions. The boxes are used to separate the 6 different allele groups named
AI to AVI. Country of origin is located at the beginning of each strain designation (Pt, Portugal; Sw, Sweden; Gr, Germany;

phase variation and may be regulated by slipped-strand
mispairing mechanism, which was not the case for the
out-of-frame homA sequences. Phase variability has been
reported to be a consistent marker for genes involved in
niche adaptation and immune evasion [23,24]. Several H.
pylori genes belonging to different functional classes have
been established as phase variable genes [25,26], among
which are OMP-encoding genes involved in adherence,
such as sabA [6], hopZ [27], babB [28] and oipA [29].
HomB was previously found to contribute to H. pylori
adherence [9]. Thus, the on/off switch of these genes
would provide the bacterial population with a dynamic
adherence pattern, as was experimentally demonstrated
for bab adherence genes [20,28]. Based on the two mechanisms proposed for regulation of homB and homA gene
expression, i.e., phase variation and intra/intergenomic
recombination events, it can be speculated that these
genes are implicated in the adaptation of H. pylori to its
human host as well. However, the fact that only 5.7% of
the strains have truncated homA/B sequences at loci A and
B does not mean that the gene is not expressed in vivo.
Indeed, the phase variation mechanism may allow the in
vivo expression. Furthermore, the existence of a third
locus, as was reported for babA/B [30], cannot be

excluded, although previous hybridization experiments
never revealed an additional locus [8,9].
Phylogenetic reconstruction of homB and homA genes was
influenced by the geographical origin of the strains, with
East Asian and Western strains showing the greatest divergence. This same clustering was observed for the paralogous genes babA and babB [31]. Overall, homB and homA
displayed identical molecular mean distance at both
nucleotide and amino acid levels. Nucleotide substitution
rates were also similar for both genes suggesting that they
are both subjected to parallel functional constraints. The
segmental phylogenetic analysis showed the highest level
of diversity for segment 2 of both genes, the middle alleledefining region, in comparison with the more conserved
segments 1 and 3. This suggests that a higher degree of variation is allowed for segment 2, supporting the hypothesis
that this gene segment is involved in the generation of
antigenic diversity.
Another interesting point is that segment 3 of both homB
and homA genes from the same strain clustered together in
the phylogenetic tree, which is indicative of concerted
evolution. This condition is observed when paralogous

members of a gene family within a strain diverge at a
slower rate than the homologous genes in other strains,
and is a consequence of gene conversion events [32]. The
evolutionary analysis of pairs of homB and homA
sequences from the same strain also indicate that segment
3 of these genes is under concerted evolution, in contrast
to segment 1 which displays a divergent evolution.
Recently, Pride et al. showed that segment 3 of both babA
and babB genes was under concerted evolution and demonstrated that the mechanism underlying this event was
babA/babB conversion by intragenomic recombination
[31]. Thus, the concerted evolution observed for segment
3 of homB and homA genes supports the idea that they are
involved in gene conversion events by intragenomic
recombination. Since the rate of concerted evolution is
expected to be higher when there are structural constraints
[32], it is likely that segment 3 of homA/homB and babA/
babB genes may encode portions of the protein that are
essential for the function or for the structural integrity of
those molecules.
Both homB and homA genes displayed allelic diversity in
the middle region (segment 2), with homB exhibiting
greater allelic diversity than homA. Allelic variation was
also reported for other members of the H. pylori OMP family, such as babA/babB [33], hopQ [34] and hopZ [27]
genes, which also share a conserved profile of gene segmentation, with the existence of at least two highly conserved allelic variants. In the case of homB and homA
genes, no disease-associated allelic variant was observed
nor was any allele associated with any particular virulence
genotype or with the geographical origin of the strain.
Instead, each gene presented a predominant worldwide
allelic variant, present in up to 80% of the clinical strains,
which may explain this lack of association. Moreover, it
also suggests that the ability of the strain to adhere is not
likely to be related to the allelic variant of the homB gene,
as was demonstrated for the major H. pylori adhesin
encoding gene babA. Indeed, it was reported that none of
the five babA or the three babB allele groups is related to
cagA, vacA or iceA genotypes or to the ability of the strain
to bind to Lewis B antigen [33]. This would suggest that a
greater allelic diversity may be more important in generating antigenic variation than in affecting the virulence of
the strain. However, the detection of an immune reaction
against a recombinant HomB protein of a single allelic
variant, observed for all of the homB and homA allelic variants does not support this hypothesis. To clarify this
issue, it would be interesting to evaluate the antigenicity
against the six different HomB and HomA expressed alleles, especially using recombinant peptides containing
only the allelic region (segment 2) of the gene, in order to
exclude the presence of possible common epitopes outside the allelic determining region. Nevertheless, the
results demonstrate that all allelic variants are expressed in
vivo, which may contribute to the generation of new alle-

les through genomic recombination, increasing the fitness
of the strains during human infection. A recombination
event involving the duplicate genes encoding for the
OMPs HopM and HopN, during human infection, which
generated new alleles of these OMPs [21] is added proof.

Conclusion
The results obtained in the present study suggest that
homB and homA genes may be among the H. pylori OMP
coding genes contributing to the mechanisms of H. pylori
persistence, and would therefore be implicated in the
development of disease.

Methods
Bacterial strains
A total of 455 H. pylori strains isolated from patients with
upper gastrointestinal symptoms, from 10 different countries were included in the analysis. Table 4 summarizes
the characteristics of the study population. Three H. pylori
reference strains were used: 26695 strain (ATCC 700392),
carrying one copy of homA gene (HP0710); HPAG1 strain,
carrying one copy of homB gene (HPAG1_0695) and J99
strain (ATCC 700824), carrying one copy of each gene,
homA (jhp0649) and homB (jhp0870) [12-14].

H. pylori strains were cultured from gastric biopsies on
agar supplemented with 10% horse blood, preserved in
Trypticase soy broth supplemented with 20% Glycerol
and maintained at -80°C until used. Genomic DNA was
extracted from a 48 h culture, using the QIAamp DNA
mini kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany), according to
the manufacturer's instructions.
Genotyping of homB and homA by PCR and sequencing
A single PCR assay was used to discriminate between the
homB and homA genes (fragments of 161 bp and 128 bp,
respectively) [8]. In order to study the diversity of homB
and homA genes, PCR primers targeting a conserved
region of the flanking genes of both loci jhp0649 and
jhp0870, according to the numbering of the J99 strain
[13], were designed for amplification of the entire genes
[8]. The fragments were subsequently sequenced using the
PCR primers and internal primers, as previously described
[8].
Sequence analysis and phylogeny
Similarity plots, using SimPlot Version 3.5.1 http://
sray.med.som.jhmi.edu/SCRoftware, were based on multiple alignments of the full nucleotide sequences of homB
and homA genes generated by the BioEdit Sequence Alignment Editor (Version 7.0.1) [35]. Nucleotide sequences
were translated using Translate Nucleic Acid Sequences
software

lutionary Genetics Analysis) 3.1 software [37], on the
basis of distances estimated using the Kimura two-parameter model [38]. This model corrects for multiple hits, taking into account transitional and transversional
substitution rates. Branching significance was estimated
using bootstrap confidence levels by randomly resampling the data 1000 times with the referred evolutionary
distance model. Evolutionary parameters were determined using MEGA 3.1. Mean molecular distances were
determined using the Kimura two-parameter method
[38], while the overall mean of Ks and Ka substitutions
were determined using the Nei-Gojobori method [39].
The standard error (SE) was determined for each parameter. A sliding window analysis of Ka and Ka/Ks ratio was
performed using Swaap 1.0.2 software (Pride, D. T.
(2000) Swaap - a tool for analyzing substitutions and similarity in multiple alignments). Due to the existence of
alignment gaps, the complete-deletion option was used
for all statistical analyses to normalize the number of differences on the basis of the number of valid sites compared. Bootstrap confidence levels were determined by
randomly resampling the sequencing data 1000 times.
The Codon Based Z-Test of selection [40] was used to evaluate the significance of the values for the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions.
In vivo expression of homB and homA allelic variants
A recombinant Glutathione S-transferase-HomB protein
(rHpHomB), constructed with the complete homB allele
type AI ORF, as previously described [9], was used to
investigate the in vivo expression of the homB and homA

allelic variants. Human sera, for which the corresponding
strain was previously characterized with regard to homB or
homA allelic variants, were used in Western-blot assays.
Ten different human sera were tested for the two predominant homB and homA allelic variants AI and AII; only one
serum was available for rarest allelic variants, AIII, AIV, AV
and AVI, and was tested. All sera (n = 24) were obtained
from adult patients (48.7 ± 6.9 years) presenting IgG antibodies against H. pylori, determined with the serological
test Pyloriset EIA-G III (Orion Diagnostica, Espoo, Finland).
