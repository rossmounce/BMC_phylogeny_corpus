What’s in a name; Genetic structure in
Solanum section Petota studied using
population-genetic tools

Abstract
Background: The taxonomy and systematic relationships among species of Solanum section Petota are
complicated and the section seems overclassified. Many of the presumed (sub)species from South America are very
similar and they are able to exchange genetic material. We applied a population genetic approach to evaluate
support for subgroups within this material, using AFLP data. Our approach is based on the following assumptions:
(i) accessions that may exchange genetic material can be analyzed as if they are part of one gene pool, and (ii)
genetic differentiation among species is expected to be higher than within species.
Results: A dataset of 566 South-American accessions (encompassing 89 species and subspecies) was analyzed in
two steps. First, with the program STRUCTURE 2.2 in an ‘unsupervised’ procedure, individual accessions were
assigned to inferred clusters based on genetic similarity. The results showed that the South American members of
section Petota could be arranged in 16 clusters of various size and composition. Next, the accessions within the
clusters were grouped by maximizing the partitioning of genetic diversity among subgroups (i.e., maximizing Fst
values) for all available individuals of the accessions (2767 genotypes). This two-step approach produced an
optimal partitioning into 44 groups.
Some of the species clustered as genetically distinct groups, either on their own, or combined with one or more
other species. However, accessions of other species were distributed over more than one cluster, and did not form
genetically distinct units.
Conclusions: We could not find any support for 43 species (almost half of our dataset). For 28 species some level
of support could be found varying from good to weak. For 18 species no conclusions could be drawn as the
number of accessions included in our dataset was too low. These molecular data should be combined with data
from morphological surveys, with geographical distribution data, and with information from crossing experiments
to identify natural units at the species level. However, the data do indicate which taxa or combinations of taxa are
clearly supported by a distinct set of molecular marker data, leaving other taxa unsupported. Therefore, the
approach taken provides a general method to evaluate the taxonomic system in any species complex for which
molecular data are available.

Background
The taxonomy of wild potato species, belonging to section Petota of the genus Solanum, is known to be problematic [1-3]. Identification of many species is difficult
and the systematic relationships among the wild potatoes are not clear. One of the causes for these

difficulties is the ability of many species to hybridize
easily [2]. Hawkes [1] hypothesized that approximately
12% of the 224 tuber-bearing Solanum species he recognized, had arisen from hybrid speciation. A quote from
Correll [4] (page 404) may serve to illustrates the magnitude of the problem: “In fact, the difficulty one
encounters in dealing with plants from northwest
Argentina and southern Bolivia is such that one is
tempted to consider, with very few exceptions the entire

Tuberarium population to be one vast assemblage of
hybrids” (section Tuberarium being roughly equivalent
to the current section Petota).
Next to hybridization there is a large amount of phenotypic plasticity, i.e., plants look different in different environments [4-6]. Partly because of this, taxonomists have
granted minor variants (sub)species status. As a consequence, species boundaries are based on morphological
characters that are not expressed under all conditions.
Hence, numerous species have been described, many of
which are extremely similar to each other, and that is
why Spooner and Salas [2] and van den Berg and Jacobs
[3] concluded that the group of wild species belonging to
Solanum section Petota is overclassified. An extreme
example of overclassification within Solanum section
Petota is the so-called brevicaule complex. Morphological
results failed to distinguish the 30 species in the brevicaule complex [7]. Molecular data showed that the brevicaule complex is paraphyletic and that many taxa should
probably be relegated to synonymy [8].
The systematic relationships among these species are
also hard to determine. These have been expressed in
an arrangement of 19 series, as designated by Hawkes
[1] and others. Some of the series are difficult to keep
apart while other series contain subgroups that could be
considered a separate series [3]. To date, the series classification of Hawkes [1] and other authors has received
no cladistic support [6]. Jacobs et al. [9] described the
taxonomic structure present in Solanum section Petota.
They focused on testing the validity of the series classification and on studying the taxonomic structure of the
section based on AFLP data. They produced the largest
dataset ever constructed for Solanum section Petota and
analysed it both phenetically and phylogenetically.
Although some of the branches in the resulting trees
were supported by jackknife values above 69, both phenetic and phylogenetic trees also display a large polytomy containing many taxa.
In the present study, we focus on the status of the
recognized species in section Petota, in order to evaluate
possible overclassification, misclassification and hybridization. The number of species in the Solanum section
Petota has already been reduced somewhat due to the
application of molecular techniques. While Hawkes [1]
still recognized 227 tuber-bearing species (of which 7
were cultivated) and 9 non tuber-bearing species within
section Petota, Spooner and Hijmans [5] recognized
only 203 tuber-bearing species, including 7 cultivated
species. Spooner and Salas [2] reduced the number
further to 189 species (including only 1 cultivated species). Phylogenetic and phenetic analysis of previous studies, reviewed in van den Berg and Jacobs [3] and
Jacobs et al. [9] revealed that accessions from many wild
Solanum species, especially the species of the South

Page 2 of 20

American series Tuberosa, Megistacroloba, and Yungasensia, are closely related. This is consistent with the
observations that they freely exchange genes and produce hybrids under artificial conditions. Because of this,
we chose as the starting point of our analysis the AFLP
data used by Jacobs et al. [9] to consider the individual
plants as belonging to one gene pool, rather than to
separate taxa, and to employ a population genetics
approach to detect the genetic structure of these AFLP
data for the group of South American representatives of
Solanum section Petota.
To test which accessions may belong to one or more
species groups we used a Bayesian population clustering
approach implemented in the program STRUCTURE
2.2 [10,11]. STRUCTURE clusters individuals without
using a-priori information about their identity. The primary assumptions of the model used in STRUCTURE
are Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) within populations and linkage equilibrium among loci, and the program attempts to find population groupings that are not
in disequilibrium [11]. Both assumptions may not always
be valid when taking a more or less random set of
accessions collected over a larger area as representing a
species, but disequilibrium will always be smaller within
a species than between species. The program has been
successfully used in a large variety of population genetic
studies, for example in the research of genetic structure
in the human population [12], in the phylogeography of
the sand-dune shrub America pungens [13], for distinguishing chicken breeds [14], and to detect hybrids
between cultivated and wild apple [15,16]. Recently,
STRUCTURE was also used in studies on phylogenetic
relationships among birch species [17], on species delimitation in a recent species radiation in turtles [18] and
in the Mexican jay [19], and produced part of the evidence for a separate species status of the Galapagos sea
lion [20].
Accessions within one species are expected to share
more alleles with each other than with accessions from
other species. As a result, genetic differentiation among
species is expected to be higher than within species.
Consequently, if we subdivide an unstructured set of
accessions according to their species labels, the fraction
of the genetic variation present among, rather than
within, groups will be higher if those species labels correctly identify the accessions. If the species labels are
incorrect then combining accessions with incorrect species labels into new groups will increase the fraction
genetic variation among the groups.
Thus, the genetic differentiation among alternative
groupings as expressed in Fst values will allow us to
further subdivide the groups resulting from the STRUCTURE analysis, and to distinguish genetically separate
species from species that should be grouped together.

This approach of species delimitation resembles somewhat the view of Shaffer and Thompson [18] that follows Mayden [21] and de Queiroz [22,23], in that they
consider species as segments of evolutionary lineages. In
this view, species delimitation comes down to identification of metapopulation-like lineages. The metapopulation lineage species definition leads to operational
species delimitation approaches that recognize sets of
populations that freely exchange genes in nature but
have no or very restricted gene exchange with other sets
of populations [18]. In this paper we describe how this
approach works out for Solanum section Petota.

Methods
Plant Material

We used the plant material from the genus Solanum
section Petota as described in Jacobs et al. [9], which
consists of 4929 genotypes representing 916 accessions.
From each accession a representative genotype was chosen [9]. A subset (out of the 916) consisting of 566
plants (one plant per accession) was made, representing
the 89 species/subspecies from South America that
appeared in the large polytomy of the trees presented by
Jacobs et al. [9], plus the accessions that do not belong
to the species groups with high jackknife or bootstrap
support (viz. excluding the following supported groups:
Acaulia group, Mexican diploid group, diploid Piurana
group, tetraploid Piurana group, polyploid Conicibaccata
group, diploid Conicibaccata group, Circaeifolia group,
Longipedicellata group, and Iopetala group). Information
on the accession numbers and geographic origin of
these 566 samples can be found in Additional file 1.
The nomenclature of the plant material follows that of
Jacobs et al. [9]. This means that in some cases we have
retained the original labels, even when taxonomic references suggested a change of the species name. However,
a number of obvious mistakes (due to mislabeling) that
became clear after preliminary AFLP analyses have been
corrected after morphological examination.
AFLP

The protocol of Vos et al. [24] was used to generate
AFLP fragments. The plant material was fingerprinted
with two EcoRI/MseI AFLP primer combinations: E32/
M49 and E35/M48. These primer combinations gave 91
and 131 polymorphic bands, respectively. The AFLP
analysis was done on a MegaBACE 2.1 by Keygene N.V.
Bands were scored as dominant markers, using the Keygene proprietary software.
Data analysis
Bayesian clustering

The 566 South-American accessions were analyzed with
STRUCTURE 2.2 [10,11] in an ‘unsupervised’ procedure

Page 3 of 20

according to Rosenberg [25] based on genetic similarities only. We used the approach of coding the dominant
markers as described by Falush et al [26]. The dominant
AFLP data were entered by coding both alleles as ‘1’
when the AFLP band was present and both as ‘0’ when
the band was absent. We specified ‘0’ as the recessive
allele for all the AFLP data. This enables the simultaneous analysis of accessions with different levels of
ploidy like described by Schenk et al. [17]. Evanno et al.
[27] showed that results of AFLPs with STRUCTURE
can be as accurate as those of microsatellites. Estimates
for the log likelihood were obtained using the admixture
model and the assumption that the allele frequencies
are correlated. The log likelihood estimates were
obtained for 10 replicate runs at each K ranging from K
= 1 to K = 30. For each run, we used a burn-in of
25,000 cycles and a data run of 100,000 cycles.
To test whether STRUCTURE was suitable for analyzing the Solanum AFLP data, a pilot analysis was carried
out on the condensed dataset of 916 individuals. Almost
all species groups as defined by Jacobs et al. [9] and
smaller supported branches in the NJ tree have their
own cluster at K = 18 or higher (results not shown),
which confirms that STRUCTURE can be used for the
AFLP dataset.
Partitioning of genetic variation within and among groups

It is unrealistic to assume that one STRUCTURE analysis could separate all species. Some of the 566 accessions may be from a genetically homogeneous species
that occupies a small area, while others may be from a
genetically highly variable species that occupies a large
area. Some species were represented by many accessions, others by only a few. Therefore, while increasing
the number of clusters (K) in the STRUCTURE analyses,
accessions of certain species may already start to be
assigned to different clusters before accessions of other
species would be separated from each other. When large
datasets are analyzed convergence problems for the
Gibbs sampler algorithm used in STRUCTURE software
may occur [12,28]. Therefore we decided do a nested
analysis.
The second level (nested) analyses could be done
again by STRUCTURE for each group separately, as e.g.
Jing et al. [29] did in Pisum. The advantage is that an a
priori grouping is made and accessions formerly classified under the same name may end up in different
groups. An alternative option was to optimize the
grouping of accessions by maximizing the Fst among
the species or among combinations of species. This has
two important advantages: (1) all plants within an accession can be included in this computationally simple analysis, and (2) even if several rounds of grouping are
performed, it is still much faster than optimizing and
performing a STRUCTURE analysis on each of the 16

clusters. A disadvantage is that accessions of the same
name remain together, which may mean that in theory
the best solution is less optimal than obtained with the
nested STRUCTURE approach.
As a pilot experiment, we performed a nested
STRUCTURE analysis on a few clusters and compared
the results to an Fst analysis of the same clusters. The
results were compared by calculating the Fst among
groups for the nested STRUCTURE analysis and for the
optimized Fst approach. The optimized Fst approach
always resulted in a higher value for the Fst among the
groups within the cluster (not shown). We therefore
decided to continue with the Fst analysis. This combination is a novel approach.
The partitioning of genetic variation (Fst) among
STRUCTURE clusters or among new groups within a
cluster was computed using AFLP-SURV 1.0 [30]. The
allelic frequencies at AFLP loci were calculated from the
observed frequencies of fragments, using the Bayesian
approach [31] (assuming diploid species and HardyWeinberg equilibrium) using all 2767 available genotypes for the 566 accessions (when available 5 plants per
accession). We assumed a uniform prior distribution of
allelic frequencies. Significance of the Fst values was

tested by 1000 permutations. The confidence limits
obtained were used to determine the significance of differences between the separate estimates.
Grouping within clusters by maximizing Fst

Within each of the 16 STRUCTURE clusters we calculated Fst based on the species present using AFLP-Surv.
Subsequently, combinations of accessions with different
species labels were made and the overall Fst value and
pairwise Fst values between the groups within a cluster
were computed. We performed several rounds of grouping. Each time the accessions of those species or groups
that showed a pairwise Fst of less than the observed
overall Fst of the groups within the cluster were combined. This process was repeated, merging species and
species groups, until further merging of groups did not
increase the overall Fst value significantly.

instance S. huancabambense with S. sogarandinum.
Many accessions labeled with the same species name are
distributed over two clusters, e.g. the accessions of
S. maglia, S. gourlayi, S. tarijense. Finally, there is a
number of species whose accessions show membership
to more than two clusters. Additional file 1 provides the
detailed results on the composition of the clusters and
the percentage of membership per individual accession
for these clusters, in the run with the highest probability. Most clusters defined by STRUCTURE for K = 16
are the same in all 10 runs. The main exception is cluster 3, which was found in only 3 out of 10 runs as a
separate unit. In the other 7 runs its accessions were
combined with those of cluster 4.
The partitioning of genetic variation among the clusters (Fst) in the 16 cluster arrangement represented 31%
of the genetic variation (Table 1). For comparison, we
also calculated that the 89 pre-existing taxa explained
29% of the existing genetic variation. A subdivision in

K. The posterior probability increases until around K =
16, after which it reaches a plateau. From K = 18
onwards the posterior probability became increasingly
variable among runs, and the clustering of accessions
became unstable between replicate runs. In contrast, at
K = 16 the clustering results were stable and most clusters had the same composition in all 10 replicate runs.
We therefore took K = 16 (Ln P(D) = -41181.7) as the
optimal K.
The estimated population structure of one run at K =
16 is shown in Figure 2. Each individual accession is
presented by a thin vertical line, and this line shows
colored segments that represent the relative percentage
of membership to the K clusters (the underlying data
can be found in Additional file 1). The accessions
labeled as S. okadae, S. raphanifolium, S. verrucosum,
and S. macropilosum occupy exclusively one cluster,
while many other accessions are found to share a cluster
with accessions from one or more other species, for

10 groups (one run of a suboptimal STRUCTURE analysis at K = 10) already explained 27%. The 566 individual
accession arrangement showed the lowest value of Fst,
as only 15% of the genetic variation is present among
accessions. All Fst values were significantly different
from each other.
The level of genetic differentiation among the accessions was lower within the clusters than among the
clusters (Table 2). The lowest values are for cluster 1, 6
and 15, which mainly or exclusively consist of accessions
with only one species label, e.g. cluster 15, which contains only S. okadae accessions, has an Fst of 0.0029.
Genetic differentiation among species within clusters
that contain accessions from two species ranged from
9.8% in cluster 4 to 27.8% in cluster 7. In cluster 4, cluster 10, and cluster 12 the species arrangement only
added a small part to the genetic differentiation, relative
to the value for all accessions separately.
Further subdivision of the 16 clusters

As the contribution to the partitioning of genetic variation could differ for the various species within a cluster,
we performed several rounds of grouping on all 2767
individuals available for these accessions. Each time
the accessions of those species that showed a pairwise
Fst of less than the observed overall Fst of the groups
within the cluster were combined into one group, so
that in the next round the number of groups was
lower. The process was repeated, merging species and
species groups, until further merging did not increase
the Fst value. Table 2 lists the Fst value of the optimal
number of groups, along with those of the value
obtained with one group more or less, and the group
structure of the optimal configuration is reported. In
most of the clusters one or two merging steps were
sufficient to reach a maximum Fst, but in cluster 7, 12,
and 14, three cycles were needed, while in cluster 10
and 16 the process took four cycles. In some clusters
the highest overall Fst was reached when most of the

species labels were merged together; this was the case
in cluster 10, 14 and 16. In other clusters the optimal
Fst was reached at an arrangement that only merged a
few of the species in the cluster, while other species
remained separate. This was the case in cluster 3, 4
and 13. In cluster 8 no new arrangement yielded a
higher Fst. Overall, the 566 accessions were grouped
into 44 genetically distinct groups.
The assignment of the 566 accessions into 44 genetically distinct groups was then used to infer the support
for the 89 species into which these accessions had been
classified. The results are presented according to taxonomical classification in Table 3, and will be discussed
below. For those species (18) that were represented by
only one accessions in this study, no conclusion could
be drawn. For 43 species there was no evidence, for 20
there was weak evidence and for 8 there was good
evidence.

Discussion
Many described species in section Petota are very similar to each other and are able to cross, suggesting that
this section is overclassified. We have tested this for the
large group of South American species of the section
Petota, using a population genetic approach that would
allow us to identify any structure among this material, if
present. The results obtained from the analysis of 566
South-American Solanum section Petota accessions with
STRUCTURE showed an optimal overall subdivision of
these accessions in 16 clusters. By maximizing the partitioning of genetic variation among groups (Fst) we
obtained support for additional groups within these
clusters, up to a total of 44 units (or 48 units including
the unknown species accessions) (Table 2). This does
not automatically mean that 44 is the correct number of
species as genetic differentiation would be expected
among separate species but it can also be found among
populations within a species (see below). Nevertheless,
the Fst values of the various species arrangements in
Table 1 offer a clear indication of overclassification: Fst
increases from 0.145 (the 566 accessions) to 0.273 (10
clusters) and to 0.312 (16 clusters). The highest value is
obtained after the nested analysis, when 44 groups
explain 35% of the genetic variation (the remainder
being present within species). The Fst value of the 89
species arrangement (0.2953) is even lower than that of
the 16 clusters (0.312), indicating that the current species arrangement is ‘over the top’ but still does explain a
considerable part of the genetic variation within the
dataset.
Misclassification and overclassification

If not all accessions of a species are in one cluster but
one or a few are present in different clusters, this may

indicate misclassification. Occurrence of different species labels intermingled within one cluster points at
overclassification. From both situations we see examples
in our dataset and these may have consequences for the
(sub) species status of the present taxa.
Status of subspecies

In nearly all cases there was no support for maintaining
taxa at the subspecies level. This is the case for the subspecies within the species S. microdontum, S. vernei,
S. boliviense and S. megistacrolobum. Only one of the
recognized subspecies was supported in our analysis:
S. commersonii subsp. malmeanum could be differentiated genetically from S. commersonii subsp. commersonii (Table 3).
Some of these (sub) species have been extensively
studied previously, using morphology. The subspecies
S. microdontum subsp. gigantophyllum was already
considered to be a synonym of S. microdontum [32]
and should not be recognized, as this is a clear case of
overclassification. Giannattasio and Spooner studied the

boundaries between S. megistacrolobum subsp. megistacrolobum and S. megistacrolobum subsp. toralapanum
using morphological data [33] and with molecular markers [34]. Based on their analysis they suggested to preserve S. megistacrolobum subsp. toralapanum as a
distinct subspecies while our analysis does not find support for this. Spooner et al. [35] studied the relationships of S. boliviense and S. astleyi using RAPDs and
concluded that S. astleyi should be reduced to a subspecies of S. boliviense. Our data do not provide support
for a subspecies level in S. boliviense.
Some species are supported

The following species are supported as genetically
distinct units: S. raphanifolium, S. verrucosum (with S.
macropilosum as synonym), S. microdontum, S. commersonii, S. okadae (only the seven accessions in cluster 15),
S. huancabambense, and S. sogarandinum. The seven
S. okadae accessions that appear in cluster 3 together
with S. venturii accessions turned out to be mislabeled
and have been corrected as being S. venturii accessions

no evidence

(personal communication R. Hoekstra, CGN). The
accessions labeled S. microdontum, S. huancabambense
and S. sogarandinum share their cluster with accessions
from other species, but the optimal partitioning of
genetic variation within the cluster shows that they
represent distinct genetic units. This is consistent with
the results from Jacobs et al. [9] and most of these species were also recognized in one or more other studies
[2,6,32,36,37].
Support for combinations of species, pointing at
overclassification

Some species are assigned to one STRUCTURE cluster,
but their accessions do not form distinct genetic units
within the cluster on their own, but combined with
accessions from another species they do (Table 2). These
are probably cases of overclassification. Examples are the
combination of S. verrucosum and S. macropilosum in
cluster 2, of S. kurtzianum and S. maglia in cluster 3, of
S. venturii and S. okadae in cluster 3, of S. sandemanii,
S. weberbauerii, and S. medians in cluster 5. Some of
these combinations have already been recognized in the
literature, e.g. S. macropilosum is considered a synonym
of S. verrucosum [6].
Spooner and Salas [2] recognized S. medians and
S. sandemanii, but not S. weberbauerii, which name
they apparently considered as a synonym (unfortunately,
information about this was not provided). Spooner et al.
[38] synonymized both S. sandemanii and S. weberbaueri under S. medians.
Accessions scattered across clusters, pointing at
mislabelling

The analysis showed that accessions from some species
were scattered across two or even three clusters. This

was the case for the accessions with the following species
labels: S. maglia, S. doddsii, S. chacoense, S. gourlayi,
S. virgultorum, S. hoopesii, S. augustii, S. tarijense
S. vernei, S. infundibuliforme, S. alandiae, S. neorosii,
S. sucrense, S. pachytrichum, and S. violaceimarmoratum.
A major cause for this situation is probably mislabeling
of accessions, although some of these species may be the
product of hybridization events that occurred a long time
ago. For instance, Solanum doddsii from Bolivia has been
hypothesized to be a hybrid between S. alandiae and
S. chacoense [39].
Misclassifications do occur since identification is often
problematic due to ambiguous species characteristics.
Problems with the identification of species were already
addressed by Spooner and Salas [2] and Spooner and
van den Berg [40], who noted that many of the taxa are
extremely similar in morphology and many species
are distinguished only by minor characters with often
overlapping character states.
Hybrid accessions

Many authors [1,2,4,41,42] have suggested that certain
recognized species in Solanum sect. Petota are the results
of hybridization. Recent hybridizations can readily be
recognized from the STRUCTURE analysis by the probability with which they are assigned to a particular cluster. While most accessions have a very high probability
(usually around 0.9) to belong to one cluster, hybrid individuals tend to have a much lower probability (< 0.5) and
have a, often only slightly lower, probability to belong to
another cluster. Schulte et al. [43] also argue that a posterior probability lower than 0.5 provides strong evidence
for a recent hybrid origin of individuals.
To practically present our results, we have assigned all
accessions to the cluster to which it had the highest

Clusters correspond to the geographical origin of the
accessions

from the southern brevicaule complex and cluster 10
consist mostly of accessions from Peru (and northern
Bolivia) that can be considered as belonging to the
northern brevicaule complex. This separation of the
brevicaule complex in a northern and southern part
was already noted by Kardolus [50], was confirmed by
Spooner and Salas [2] and is accepted in the treatment
of this group on the Solanaceae Source website (http://
www.solanaceaesource.org), where Spooner and his
collaborators maintain two species, S. candolleanum
for the northern representatives, and S. brevicaule for
the southern representatives. Cluster 7 contains almost
exclusively Peruvian accessions, and some species
labels in cluster 7 (S. albornozii, S. augustii, S. chancayense, S. dolichocremastrum, S. immite) are associated with series Piurana [1,2], but Jacobs et al. [9]
could not find support for these species to be included
in one of the recognized Piurana species groups. Ames
and collaborators [49,51] studied putative members of
series Piurana with, respectively, morphological data
and COSII markers, and concluded that based on morphology only three out of a total of 33 species could
be recognized. The molecular data supported more
species, some of them lacking morphological support,
and the authors announced that decisions on species
boundaries will be formalized in a forthcoming taxonomic monograph.
Cluster 14 contains all S. berthaultii accessions and
almost all S. tarijense accessions, plus a few accessions
with other species labels, which mostly come from Bolivia and Argentina. Cluster 12 contains accessions from
various geographical origins, most of them from Bolivia
and Argentina but some are from Peru and Paraguay.
This group may represent accessions that relatively
easily exchanged genetic material. The geographical distribution of accessions within clusters is consistent with
the notion that our approach produces a meaningful
arrangement of the accessions into groups that may
(have) exchange(d) genetic material. For exchange of
genetic material at least the accessions with the different
species labels should have overlapping or adjacent geographical areas, at present or in the recent past.
Indeed, information on the distribution areas of the
species of sect. Petota given in Hijmans et al. [52] confirms overlapping areas for many species within the
recognized clusters, e.g. the species S. augustii, S. immite
and S. dolichocremastrum in cluster 7, and S. berthaultii
and S. tarijense in cluster 14.

Many accessions within a cluster come from the same
geographical region (Additional file 1). For the largest
and most complicated clusters (7, 10, 12, 14, 16) the
information on the geographic origin of the accessions
allows to draw some tentative conclusions. Cluster 16
contains mostly accessions from Argentina and Bolivia

Conclusion
A large number of species is presently recognized in the
group of South American representatives of Solanum
section Petota. The approach taken in the present paper
was to determine the genetic distinctiveness of these

probability, but Additional file 1 lists all probabilities for
all accessions. Hybrid accessions thus identified include
amongst others accessions of the species S. spegazzinii
and S. gourlayi, which co-occur in northern Argentina.
The S. spegazzinii accession SPG386 was assigned to
cluster 3 with a probability of 0.459 and with 0.262 to
cluster 16. Another example of recent hybridization is
NRS737 which shows probabilities of 0.435 and 0.434
with the clusters 13 and 15, respectively. However, in all
cases the actual parents are unknown.
Non-supported species

Some species do appear in one cluster in the STRUCTURE analysis, but their accessions do not form a separate group in the Fst analysis, not even as part of a fixed
combination with another species label. This concerns
the following species: S. mochiquense, S. immite,
S. chancayense in cluster 7, S. canasense, S. bukasovii,
S. candolleanum, S. coelestipetalum, S. pampasense, S.
ambosinum, S. marinasense, S. multidissectum, S. velardei in cluster 10, S. arnezii, S. yungasense, in cluster 12,
S. incamayoense in cluster 13, S. tarijense, S. berthaultii
in cluster 14, S. arac-pappa, S. leptophyes, S. ugentii, S.
oplocense, S. sparsipilum, and S. brevicaule in cluster 16.
Many species mentioned in this category are part of
what is termed the ‘brevicaule complex’ [7,8,44]: S.
canasense S. bukasovii, S. candolleanum, S. coelestipetalum, S. pampasense, S. ambosinum, S. marinasense,
S. velardei, S. incamayoense, S. leptophyes, S. ugentii and
S. sparsipilum. Ugent [45] already proposed in 1970 that
these should be reduced to one species. The division of
the species according to our analysis in two clusters
(10 and 16) reflects the presence of the northern and
southern subgroups of the brevicaule-complex (see
below). Solanum oplocense was shown to be a welldefined species using morphological data [7] and molecular data [8], but it was not distinct in an AFLP study
[46] nor in ours. Previous results from a morphological
study [47] and a more recent molecular study [48] had
already suggested that the species S. berthaultii and
S. tarijense should be combined. The species in cluster
7 were studied morphologically by Ames and collaborators
[49], who placed Solanum immite and S. chancayense
among the 6 distinctive species in a group of 29 species,
the remainder of which were ‘difficult to distinguish’.

species. The outcome questions the species and subspecies status of more than half of the taxonomic labels
used in South American part of Solanum section Petota.
The genetically distinct clusters and groups within clusters resulting from our analysis can be used as a basis
for recognizing groups of species and for an evaluation
of species status (Table 3).
