Abstract
Background: Many attempts are being made to understand biological subjects at a systems level.
A major resource for these approaches are biological databases, storing manifold information about
DNA, RNA and protein sequences including their functional and structural motifs, molecular
markers, mRNA expression levels, metabolite concentrations, protein-protein interactions,
phenotypic traits or taxonomic relationships. The use of these databases is often hampered by the
fact that they are designed for special application areas and thus lack universality. Databases on
metabolic pathways, which provide an increasingly important foundation for many analyses of
biochemical processes at a systems level, are no exception from the rule. Data stored in central
databases such as KEGG, BRENDA or SABIO-RK is often limited to read-only access. If
experimentalists want to store their own data, possibly still under investigation, there are two
possibilities. They can either develop their own information system for managing that own data,
which is very time-consuming and costly, or they can try to store their data in existing systems,
which is often restricted. Hence, an out-of-the-box information system for managing metabolic
pathway data is needed.
Results: We have designed META-ALL, an information system that allows the management of
metabolic pathways, including reaction kinetics, detailed locations, environmental factors and
taxonomic information. Data can be stored together with quality tags and in different parallel
versions. META-ALL uses Oracle DBMS and Oracle Application Express. We provide the METAALL information system for download and use. In this paper, we describe the database structure
and give information about the tools for submitting and accessing the data. As a first application of
META-ALL, we show how the information contained in a detailed kinetic model can be stored and
accessed.
Conclusion: META-ALL is a system for managing information about metabolic pathways. It
facilitates the handling of pathway-related data and is designed to help biochemists and molecular
biologists in their daily research. It is available on the Web at http://bic-gh.de/meta-all and can be
downloaded free of charge and installed locally.

Background
Modern molecular biological research produces large
amounts of data. One main problem remains the elucidation and representation of relationships between the compounds of biological systems. A large number of
information systems holding data from molecular biology has been developed by public and private research
projects [1]. A rapidly growing field is the collection of
data associated to metabolic pathways, available from
information systems such as KEGG [2], BRENDA [3], UMBBD [4] or Reactome [5]. Depending on the requirements
defined upon the initiation of these projects, the features
and implementations differ significantly among these systems. For example, BRENDA holds detailed kinetic information about enzymes, whereas KEGG contains maps of
metabolic pathways and detailed descriptions about their
elements. Often, the existing systems are not well structured, because they have been grown over the years.
Hence, they are not able to store all necessary information
[6]. For example, many of the systems are not capable of
describing the complexity of higher organisms. Especially
the differentiation between loci inside of organisms, the
consideration of developmental stages and stress factors,
and detailed representation of kinetics and regulation is
only partially possible. Additionally, there are errors
resulting from faulty text-mining procedures or genomebased pathway predictions, which make the data only
conditionally useful. Hence, existing systems often represent collections of reference pathways. This is useful for
getting an idea of the metabolic processes as in the case of
the well-known Boehringer charts [7,8], however, in
many cases it is insufficient. Only rudimentary details are
stored about the real location of these processes, such as
the organism, tissue, cell type and compartment, while
comprising comprehensive information about pathway
structures in general. Also, only sparse information is
given about circumstances under which the data points
were determined, such as growth conditions or sampling
time. Hence, some of the represented pathways are nonoccurring in reality. As an exception the SABIO-RK system
[9] should be mentioned, which focuses on the storage of
fine-grained and high-quality data in a central instance.
Another important problem biochemists and molecular
biologists are faced with is the management of their own
data. Currently, experimentalists can develop an own
information system for managing that own data, but this
is very time-consuming and costly. An alternative would
be to try to get their data into existing systems. Often, this
is not possible. In case that scientists have different opinions about certain items, pathway data needs to be stored
in different parallel versions. However, this is not possible
with most of the existing systems.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/465

In an attempt to overcome these problems and to provide
the scientific community with a software system that
meets their requirements, we initiated the META-ALL
project. META-ALL is designed for management of
detailed information about metabolic pathways, including reactions, translocations, substances, pathways, locations and kinetic parameters. The system contains a
versioning system and a Web interface for entering and
querying of data.
Meta-All is a software package that is initially distributed
with an example data-set only. It can be installed locally
to help biologists and biochemists in their daily research.
The user can enter own experimental data as well as data
sets from other sources such as publications or databases.
Once the user's instance of Meta-All is populated with sufficient amounts of data, a variety of complex queries will
be possible due to the detailed structure of the database
schema. Examples for such queries are dependent on the
filling of the system, and could be: "What is the Km value
for enzyme x in compartment y of organ z of organism w?"
or "If a value for organism x is missing, what value was
measured in the closest relative (in taxonomical sense) of
that organism?"
In this paper, at first we give an overview about the technical background of the system. In the second part we
describe the database schema, before we provide details
about the user-interface we developed for managing the
contents of the database. Finally, we discuss our system in
relation to other systems.

Implementation
Technical design of Meta-All
META-ALL uses the Oracle database management system,
which is extensively used in academia and industry. Furthermore, Oracle provides several useful tools for easy creation of user interfaces and a security concept for
protecting selected data. For the user-frontend, we use
Oracle Application Express [10]. It allows the wizardaided creation of Web-interfaces based on the underlying
database schema with the help of a set of components,
such as graphical and non-graphical reports, forms and
trees, which can be easily integrated into different areas
(regions) of Web pages. We use the user management provided by Oracle Application Express for allowing the creation of users with different rights such as read/write or
read-only access. Oracle Application Express addresses
also the concerns of multiple-user access with built-in
check constraints. Hence, it is possible for multiple users
to use META-ALL at the same time; it is ensured that two
users cannot edit the same data simultaneously and that
one user cannot overwrite the respective changes of the
other user.

META-ALL can be accessed in two ways. First, we provide
a demo instance of META-ALL on our server which is
accessible via our project Web page [11]. This instance is
intended to provide an overview about the abilities of
META-ALL. A guest user account with the username
"guest" and the password "meta-all" allows the user to see
a pathway from sucrose breakdown in potato as a test data
set [12]. The demo instance will be reset at regular intervals. The second possibility is to download META-ALL
and to install it locally. That requires Oracle DBMS and
Oracle Application Express running. This can be either a
commercial version of Oracle software or an Oracle
Express Edition [13], which is a freely available lightweight Oracle DBMS coming along with an integrated
Application Express installation. The META-ALL application including the initial data set and the installation procedure is available for download free of charge at our
project Web page.
Database schema
The database schema is divided into several parts. The
main parts are conversions, substances, pathways, locations (taxonomy, developmental stage, cytology), references and versioning. A simplified version reflecting all
objects storable in the database schema is shown in Fig. 1.
The complete relational schema comprising 51 database
tables is available at the META-ALL project Web page. To
develop the database schema of META-ALL, we compared
several existing information systems storing data about
metabolic pathways and extensively discussed with experimentalists about their needs and wishes. The schema was
improved in multiple cycles, according to the spiral model
[14] popular in software engineering.
Conversions and substances
The central parts of the schema are conversions and substances. A conversion is a reaction or a translocation, both
of them either actively (enzyme-catalysed or transportermediated, respectively) or passively (spontaneous or by
diffusion, respectively). All necessary information can be
stored with every conversion: name and synonym(s), formula, type (reaction, translocation) and subtype (kinetic
reaction type for enzymes, type of transporter). Conversions are categorised into pathways and pathways into
super-pathways. Furthermore, some specific information
can be included, e.g. for the layout of cycles (if there is a
clockwise or an anti-clockwise cycle, or if it is an open or
closed one). The substance is an umbrella term for transporters, enzymes, metabolites and macromolecules, the
latter of which consists of one or more types of metabolite
units. Each substance plays a certain role in a conversion,
which can be catalyst in case the substance is an enzyme,
or substrate (= input substance) in case the substance is a
metabolite. Furthermore, a metabolite can be a modulator (activator or inhibitor) of a reaction, the product (=

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/465

output substance) or act as a coenzyme. Each of the role
information can be enriched by detailed information such
as Vmax values, affinity constants, etc. Each piece of information is assigned to the location information and publications.
Locations and taxonomy
Conversions take place at different locations inside an
organism depending on the developmental state and
environmental effects, and the database schema reflects as
many of these parameters as possible. We focused on the
use of existing ontologies in order to have a controlled
vocabulary allowing the comparison of data from different sources. For our instance of META-ALL we decided to
use PlantOntology [15] terms to distinguish cytological
aspects of plants and also for developmental stages,
because the scientific focus of our institute is plant
research. The META-ALL system can be easily extended by
other ontologies or user-defined terms, respectively. To
determine the taxonomy of the organisms, we use the
NCBI taxonomy ID [16] enriched by established
attributes such as family, genus or species. Additionally,
META-ALL allows the storage of genetic distance matrices
of different organisms. The user can infer these matrices
for example by comparison of gene sequences from the
organisms stored in the database. Thus, in case a pathway
is poorly investigated in one organism, this feature allows
the recruitment of data from a phylogenetically closely
related species.
Reference information
As publications represent probably the most important
knowledge source, it is crucial to store reference information with as many data points as possible. We decided to
use the widely accepted standard of PubMed IDs instead
of developing an integrated publication management.
Hence, META-ALL stores the PubMed ID for each publication and a text field is provided to store necessary information for yet unpublished data. The record has to be
updated manually once a PubMed ID is available. If using
the META-ALL Web-Interface described below, the user is
shown the PubMed ID and, if existing, the remark field.
The NCBI Web page with the abstract of the publication
can be opened in a new window using a provided link.
Quality tags and data versioning
The data for which META-ALL is intended usually has different quality levels. Hence, the storage of additional
quality information and the possibility to store curated
data, as it was pointed out in [17], is required. In addition,
there is a strong need for a versioning system for a pathway database like META-ALL, because biochemical data is
sometimes ambiguous and even long-established views
are subject to change. We need to be able to store different
revisions of pathways as scientists tend to have different

Simplified schema of the Meta-All database
Simplified schema of the Meta-All database. Simplified UML [30] structure diagram of the database schema. The complete schema is available at the META-ALL project Web page. Rectangles symbolise classes (e.g. substance) without attributes
and methods. Lines between classes symbolise relationships between the classes, called associations. Small diamonds at one of
the ends of a line symbolise part-of relations. A black diamond means a composition (the single parts cannot exist on their
own), an open diamond means an aggregation (the single part can exist on its own). A line with a triangle at one of the ends
symbolises an inheritance relation (e.g. both metabolite class and enzyme class belong to the substance class). Numbers next to
lines specify the allowed cardinalities for an instance of that class, for example, the 1..* at the line between metabolite and macromolecule means that a macromolecule consists of at least one (1) metabolite up to an unlimited (*) number of metabolites.

opinions about certain issues. There are several possibilities for data versioning [18,19]. Linear versioning could
be used, which means that each version has only one successor. In contrast, as one of our requirements to the system was to enable parallel instances of pathways, a
hierarchical versioning would be a benefit. Both linear
and hierarchical versioning can be subdivided into continuous versioning and discrete versioning. Continuous
versioning means that every simple change is a new version. In contrast, if using discrete versioning, which was
used for META-ALL, a new version is created at a certain
interval. In the context of META-ALL, the decision to create a new version is made by the user. All versioned values
are stored in the same table distinguished by the status.
We do not work with shadow tables archiving older values, because then only one value would actually be avail-

able. The term "status" as used in META-ALL is a label
comprising the time-stamp at which a new version was
created. In addition, it contains information such as the
author of the version, the originality of the data (e.g. inhouse data, public database), the quality of the data (e.g.
hand-curated, imported from external source, putative)
and the ID of the status record the newly generated status
(or version) is based on. The labelled data sets can be
improved gradually. Additionally, old pathways can be
kept for publication purposes (in case the pathway has
been improved in the meanwhile).
The Meta-All Web-Interface
The META-ALL Web interface is the central user-interface
to the META-ALL database (Fig. 2). We used the Application Express [10] technology from Oracle as described

above (subsection Technical design of the system). METAALL comes along with two levels of navigation tabs reflecting the certain parts of the database schema. Each part
(level one) consists of several pages (level two). Several
forms allow inserting new data, creating and assigning of
versions, publications, etc. For example, the user can
insert new substances (e.g. metabolites or enzymes). Consecutively, these substances can be assigned with conversion processes, which can be assigned with pathways,
super-pathways and so on. All data can be visualised using
reports, and selective data can also be edited depending
on the authorisation of the user. Several reports are possible inside of META-ALL, e.g. graphical reports about contents of the database as there are enzymes and
metabolites, or groupings of reactions regarding to the
pathways they belong to. Whole pathways can be selected
and then exported from the META-ALL Web-Interface in
SBML format [20]. META-ALL comes with the general rate
law for a number of standard kinetic types (e.g. Ping-Pong
bi bi) using MathML [21]. The user associates a conversion with a kinetic type. When an SBML file is generated
for a pathway, META-ALL uses the necessary information
such as the binding order of the substrates, which are
stored together with the conversion, and fills the according values into the rate law. The SBML file can be loaded
into a visualisation system, e. g. VANTED [22], as shown
in Fig. 3, or into a simulation system, e. g. COPASI [23].

Results
META-ALL is an information system for managing data
about metabolic pathways, which is available for download and local installation, in order to help experimentalists in their daily research. We provide both the database
schema (together with an initial set of data from sucrose
breakdown in the potato tuber) and the user interface. It
is available from the META-ALL Web page. Additionally,
we provide a demo instance of the META-ALL system on
our server.
Case study
The pathway by which sucrose is transformed to starch in
developing potato tubers has been subject of numerous
studies over several decades (for a review see [24]). A
detailed kinetic model has been created [12] in an attempt
to better understand the dynamics of this pathway. The
model consists of 14 reactions with their according ratelaws, which are further defined by a total of 74 constants.
The data contained in the model represents a useful test
data set for META-ALL and was thus entered into the system. It is possible to represent all data from the model in
META-ALL, including:

• The enzyme name, EC number and stoichiometric formula.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/465

• The kinetic type of the reaction, together with the organism this was determined in.
• The name of each metabolite, the role it plays in which
reaction, and the binding- and dissociation order in these
reactions.
• The kinetic parameters of each reaction such as binding
or inhibitory constants, maximal velocity and equilibrium constant; their value and unit; the organism, tissue,
cell, and compartment the constant was measured in.
• For all data, the reference and the according PubMed ID
(if available) is given, together with a tag if this kinetic
type was measured or estimated.
The structure of the metabolic network has been exported
from META-ALL as an SBML file and imported into the
data visualisation system VANTED for a visualisation of
the pathway. Figure 3 shows the result of the visualisation.
While this procedure shows the potential of the system, it
should be pointed out that the connection of META-ALL
to VANTED is only one of numerous possibilities that
could be implemented depending on the preferences of
the user.

Discussion
Although there exist several information systems for storing metabolic pathway data, we decided to develop a new
one, because many of the existing systems are not capable
of meeting the requirements of experimentalists working
on higher organisms. We analysed a variety of existing
information systems concerning their advantages and disadvantages and made these information the fundament of
our requirement analysis. An exciting study in this field is
published in [25].
An information system of high interest is SABIO-RK [9]. It
focuses on the curation of data about biochemical reactions, including their kinetic properties. The limitations of
SABIO-RK are that data is stored in a central instance with
a read-only access and that there is no user interface for
inserting data. A system with similar goals as Meta-All is
aMAZE [26]. It consists of a WorkBench for storing pathway data and a front-end (LightBench) for accessing this
data. Additional components, namely the Snow Workbench and a direct SQL access to the data, are available. To
the best of our knowledge, aMAZE cannot store information about reaction kinetics, and is not able to write SBML
files. In the current version the aMAZE LightBench can be
used for querying data in the central installation in Belgium only. The intension of META-ALL is to support
experimentalists in their daily work. While most of the
existing systems focus on storing and curating data in a
central instance, e. g. KEGG, and can just be accessed read-

main parts of the database schema as described in Fig. 1. There are tabs for substances, locations, conversions, pathways and
the management of versions and publications. These tabs open sub-pages each with several items belonging to the particular
part of the schema. a) shows an input form for inserting data about metabolites, and b) is a simple report listing enzymes. c) is

only, META-ALL can be installed locally, and data can be
inserted and edited. Research groups or even whole institutes can manage their "fresh" data, or even data subject
to current investigations. The management is supported
by versioning and quality tagging. Furthermore, not only
reaction data, but also translocation data can be managed
with META-ALL.
META-ALL uses an Oracle database management system
for persistently storing metabolic pathway data and an
Oracle Application Express user interface. An installation

instruction containing database schema, user interface
and initial data set can be obtained from the META-ALL
project Web page. It can be used with either a commercial
Oracle license or the Oracle Database 10 g Express Edition, which is available free of charge from Oracle Corporation.
We prepared several reports for the META-ALL user interface and used our system in conjunction with VANTED for
pathway visualisation. We plan to connect META-ALL to
the Systems Biology Modelling Environment (SYBME)

pathway data stored in META-ALL was exported into an SBML file using the SBML export filter. The file was subsequently
loaded into the network visualisation system VANTED [22]. As the SBML format does not specify a layout of the model, an
automatic force directed layout was applied which served as a starting point for the manual refinement of the overall model
layout.

[27] to further support the user in the kinetic metabolic
modelling. Within SYBME, a user will be able to browse
through the information of metabolites and reactions
available in his/her META-ALL instance, may combine
this information into a kinetic model and can finally visualise and simulate the model with the two connected
simulators, GEPASI [28] and JARNAC [29].
For the future, we plan to facilitate the following application using META-ALL: the semi-automatic generation of
kinetic models of a certain pathway. The procedure for
this task will be as follows: the user enters the pathway
that should be modelled and defines the boundaries of
the model (substrates, products). An application of
META-ALL then queries the database for all information
about the enzymes present in this pathway at a specific
location in a given organism. If a certain kinetic parameter
is not available for an enzyme, it will be possible to take
the data from the taxonomically nearest neighbour species for which the data is available with the help of the
genetic distance matrix included in META-ALL. This is a
common approach for constructing kinetic models, which
is normally done through tedious literature searches. The
data can then be presented to the user who can decide
which data to keep and which to change. Subsequently,
the model could be exported in standard formats such as
SBML. We are aware that this is a future application implying that the database is filled with a sufficient amount of
data, which is in the responsibility of the user. The user
could, for example, import large datasets from existing
sources and improve the data step by step. This procedure
is supported by the quality and versioning tagging
described in subsection Database schema.
