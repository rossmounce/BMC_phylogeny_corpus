<p>Biased usage of on sequence
Splicing constraints amino acids near exons.</p> boundaries is phylogenetically widespread and characteristic of species for which there
are expected to be problems defining exon-intron

Abstract
Background: In mammals, splice-regulatory domains impose marked trends on the relative
abundance of certain amino acids near exon-intron boundaries. Is this a mammalian particularity or
symptomatic of exonic splicing regulation across taxa? Are such trends more common in species
that a priori have a harder time identifying exon ends, that is, those with pre-mRNA rich in intronic
sequence? We address these questions surveying exon composition in a sample of phylogenetically
diverse genomes.
Results: Biased amino acid usage near exon-intron boundaries is common throughout the
metazoa but not restricted to the metazoa. There is extensive cross-species concordance as to
which amino acids are affected, and reduced/elevated abundances are well predicted by knowledge
of splice enhancers. Species expected to rely on exon definition for splicing, that is, those with a
higher ratio of intronic to coding sequence, more introns per gene and longer introns, exhibit more
amino acid skews. Notably, this includes the intron-rich basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans,
which, unlike intron-poor ascomycetes (Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae),
exhibits compositional biases reminiscent of the metazoa. Strikingly, 5 prime ends of nematode
exons deviate radically from normality: amino acids strongly preferred near boundaries are strongly
avoided in other species, and vice versa. This we suggest is a measure to avoid attracting transsplicing machinery.
Conclusion: Constraints on amino acid composition near exon-intron boundaries are
phylogenetically widespread and characteristic of species where exon localization should be
problematic. That compositional biases accord with sequence preferences of splice-regulatory
proteins and are absent in ascomycetes is consistent with selection on exonic splicing regulation.

Background

The maxim that 'form follows function', dogmatically adhered
to in some early 20th century design and architecture, refers
to the idea that the final function of a product should be the
only determinant of its design. Phenotypic products of evolu-

tionary processes have also frequently been analyzed in this
seductively simple framework.
However, costs of production, the availability of raw materials, and other factors regularly lead to marketable goods

being suboptimally designed as far as their immediate function is concerned. Likewise, in, for example, mammals, amino
acid content of a protein reflects localized GC content [1].

[8]. Importantly, ESEs function in a position-dependent
manner, their efficiency in catalyzing splicing decreasing with
increasing distance from the splice site [9,10]. The significant
enrichment near exon-intron boundaries for GAA (a codon
known to be overrepresented in ESEs) compared with the
synonymous GAG is consistent with this finding [10,11]. More
generally, in mammals codons enriched in ESEs are more
common near intron-exon boundaries [12].

The need to encode, in exonic sequence, information relevant
for correct splicing is another factor with the potential to
influence protein composition [2]. Located in the exonic parts
of primary mRNA transcripts, exonic splicing enhancers
(ESEs) are short (6-8 nucleotides) nucleotide motifs that
have been established as a core component of the pre-mRNA
splicing mechanism in metazoans [3]. Playing a critical role in
constitutive as well as alternative splicing [4], they function at
multiple stages of spliceosome assembly by interacting with
corresponding RNA recognition motifs in a number of different trans-factors [4]. We will primarily focus on SR (serinearginine) proteins because their binding specificities and
functions in splicing regulation have been most extensively
characterized. SR proteins appear critical for establishing, in
conjunction with other proteins, cross-exon complexes that
enable faithful communication between splice sites [3].

A recent study by Parmley et al. [2] suggests ESEs have also
left an imprint on the amino acid composition of proteins.
Exploring exonic sequences adjacent to exon-intron boundaries in human and mouse, the authors reported marked
trends in the relative abundance of certain amino acids when
one moves away from the boundary. Some amino acids, such
as lysine (K) and isoleucine (I), are strongly preferred near
boundaries whereas others, such as proline (P) and alanine
(A), are significantly avoided (for a full list see Tables 1 and 2).
This is the case for both 5' and 3' ends of exons. Considering
separately the two-fold and four-fold blocks of the six-fold
degenerate amino acids, the authors also showed that these
trends are owing to avoidances/preferences at the nucleotide
level and that there is a high degree of correspondence
between the codons preferred and their involvement in computationally predicted and experimentally verified ESEs.

Recognition of exonic alongside intronic sequence motifs has
been proposed to be pivotal in organisms where a majority of
exons are flanked by much larger introns, allowing exons to
be efficiently identified and not lost in a sea of intronic
sequence [5]. Furthermore, whereas in Saccharomyces cerevisiae splice sites and branch point sequences show a high
degree of conservation to ensure the intron is correctly targeted by the splicing machinery, these recognition motifs
tend to be less well conserved in multicellular organisms [6]
and intron-rich fungal genomes [7].

But are these trends a peculiarity of mammals or common in
other taxa? Does the presence or absence of trends correspond to what is known about the significance of exonic splicing regulation in each species? For example, a recent survey
of several eukaryote genomes showed the SR protein family to
be greatly expanded in metazoans but scarcely represented in
unicellular genomes [13]. A failure to find preference trends
in S. cerevisiae, an organism lacking SR proteins [14], might

Experimentally raising the number of natural exonic
enhancer sites leads to an additive increase in splicing activity

corroborate the hypothesis that preference patterns are
indeed caused by ESEs. Moreover, if there are discernible
trends in other species, do we repeatedly see the same amino
acids avoided or preferred or are trends largely unique to each
species? Also, are mammals unusual in showing a tight correlation between 5' and 3' trends, and may divergent results
bear implications for the workings of the splicing machinery?
Finally do we find more skews in species that a priori are
expected to have a harder time identifying exons, that is,

Nature and diversity of amino acid abundance trends near exon-intron boundaries
Nature and diversity of amino acid abundance trends near exon-intron boundaries. Relative abundance of glutamine (Q), methionine (M), and lysine (K) as
a function of distance from the boundary across 5' ends of D. melanogaster exons is shown. Glutamine is significantly avoided near the boundary (rho =
0.86, P < 1.84E-7), lysine is preferred (rho = -0.65, P < 6.2E-5), whilst no significant trend is evident for methionine (rho = 0.096, P = 0.59). Note that a
negative slope/rho value indicates a preference near the exon-intron boundary. Typically, where patterns of preference/avoidance are evident, we observe
quasi-monotonic decreases/increases in relative abundance across the sequence range analyzed.

Genome Biology 2008,

Drosophila melanogaster (Dm), Apis mellifera (Am)), one
plant (Arabidopsis thaliana (At)) and two ascomycetous
fungi (S. cerevisiae (Sc), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp)),
were examined for trends in amino acid composition as one
approaches the exon-intron boundary. Species were chosen
from among a relatively small set of organisms for which high
quality comparative data on splice-regulatory proteins have
recently become available [13]. As splice site signals can
extend into exons and our focus is on exonic splicing regulation, we removed the first full codon at the exon-intron
boundary (see Materials and methods). Thereafter, rank correlations (rho) between distance from the boundary (34
codons into the exon; see Materials and methods) and proportional usage of the amino acid were computed independently for 5' and 3' regions of exons. Further, for all amino
acids independently we fitted a linear regression extracting
the slope of the line to be used as a crude diagnostic for the
strength of amino acid preference/avoidance. Figure 1 illustrates the different types of relationship observed.
Two-fold and four-fold blocks of the six-fold degenerate
amino acids were considered as distinct groupings so that a
total of 46 tests (23 amino acid groups 5' and 3') were carried
out for each species. Tables 1 and 2 give a comprehensive byspecies overview of amino acid preferences/avoidances, significant after Bonferroni correction (N = 46 comparisons, P <
0.0011). Additional data file 1 contains the complete set of
rank correlations for all 11 species.
The most conspicuous feature of Tables 1 and 2 is arguably
the commonality of trends in the metazoa and the scarcity of
trends in the ascomycetous yeast species. The two-fold block
of leucine (L2) in S. cerevisiae is the only amino acid grouping
exhibiting a significant preference trend (rho = -0.4482, P <
0.0003). This is in stark contrast to the suite of multicellular
eukaryotes where an extensive range of avoidance and preference trends is observed. Only three multicellular species display fewer than 13 significant trends (Dm, Ag, At) whereas
five (Hs, Mm, Ce, Cb, Am) display more than 20. For D. melanogaster and C. elegans, we tested whether the results
might be biased as a result of exon homology, but in either
case found amino acid abundance patterns at exon ends to be
virtually identical in a set of homology-reduced genes (Dm, N
= 8,840; Ce, N = 11,790; Additional data files 2 and 3).
The role of exonic guidance in splicing organization has been
linked to multiple aspects of genome composition and premRNA structure, including intron/exon length [15,16], intron
number [7] and density [17] and splice site information content [7,18,19]. The number of significant amino acid trends
per species tightly covaries with some of these factors, notably
the mean number of introns per gene (rho = 0.95, P <
0.0001), median coding sequence (median CDS) per gene
(rho = -0.97, P < 0.0007), genomic number of introns (rho =
0.86, P < 0.003), and intron length (log10(mean length): rho
= 0.83, P < 0.006) as expected under a model where complex

transcripts with multiple long introns elicit increasing reliance on exon definition [15]. On the other hand, neither SR
protein family size (rho = 0.59, P = 0.09) nor splice site information content (5', rho = -0.26, P = 0.50; 3', rho = 0.43, P =
0. 25) show any relationship with the number of amino acid
skews near intron-exon boundaries. The latter observation is
perhaps the more interesting as it suggests that there is no
straightforward compensatory relationship between splice
site information content and the need for exonic regulation
across species.
Finally, the number of exons from which amino acid trends
were derived, although correlated with the number of trends
(rho = 0.86, P < 0.003), does not feature among the top predictors when multicollinearity is controlled for (Additional
data files 4-6). Together with the observation that we find relatively few trends in Arabidopsis, despite the substantial
number of exons sampled, this suggests that sample size is
not the critical factor in detecting different numbers of trends
across species. We must stress, however, that the above
results should be regarded as strictly exploratory given the
small number of observations (Additional data file 4). A
greater number of species with more comprehensive phylogenetic sampling will be required to validate the results in the
future.
The preeminence of exon-intron structure in predicting the
number of amino acid trends suggests that the intron-poor
ascomycetous fungi analyzed here might not be representative of their kingdom. We therefore analyzed the composition
of exon ends in Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn), an intronrich basidiomycete. Strikingly, we find a large number (26) of
preference and avoidance trends in this species (Table 3 and
Additional data file 1), with some marked similarities in comparison to metazoan trends, particularly 5'. Furthermore, the
inclusion of C. neoformans data in the analysis of potential
predictor variables does not substantially change previous
results: the mean number of introns per gene (rho = 0.91, P <
0.0002), median CDS per gene (rho = -0.68, P < 0.032) and
the genomic number of introns (rho = 0.72, P < 0.02) remain
strong predictors (Additional data file 6).
Virtually nothing is known about the splicing mechanism in
C. neoformans but the demonstration of alternative splicing
pathways in this species [20] as well as low splice site information content (Additional data file 5) [7] make the presence
of exonic splicing regulation a credible possibility. Consistent
with this, the predicted C. neoformans proteome contains
multiple proteins resembling known eukaryotic SR proteins,
particularly in that they harbor RNA recognition domains
(Additional data file 7). This is suggestive of involvement in
splicing, albeit evidently insufficient to reach conclusions
about specific functional roles of these proteins.

fold degenerate blocks of leucine, arginine, and serine, respectively.

Cross-species patterns
Whilst the spectra of amino acids preferred/avoided by individual species are ultimately unique in breadth (how many
trends) and composition (which amino acids are affected),
there is considerable cross-specific overlap in terms of
whether a particular trend is present at all, its direction, and
relative strength (as measured by the slope of the line of best
fit). Tables 1 and 2 illustrate that this particular agreement is
virtually perfect between human and mouse [2], with marginal differences in the relative strength of individual trends,
and that directionality is conserved throughout. Considering
zebrafish (Dr) as the only other vertebrate in our sample
alongside these species, we notice that its spectrum is slightly
diminished in breadth and contains a few trends not seen in
the two mammals (G (3'), V (5',3')). However, overall concordance in composition and strength is still remarkably
good, and the 'mammalian pattern of directionality' perfectly
adhered to. The nematode pair almost matches the humanmouse dyad in terms of overall concordance of preference
patterns, with directionality perfectly conserved.

For the most part, the patterns of preference/avoidance are
repeatable across species. Table 4 shows pairwise comparisons between species giving rank correlations (rho) for the
slopes derived from all 23 amino acid groupings. For the vertebrate group both 5' and 3' correlations are very high (all rho
> 0.9, all P < 1.81E-06; 90 tests, significance threshold, P <
5.56E-04), with human and mouse in almost perfect agreement. More remarkably, however, some strong correlations
also exist 3' between the vertebrates and, for example, Anopheles (all rho > 0.87, all P < 2.94E-06) and Drosophila (all rho
> 0.75, all P < 2.9E-05). The 3' correlations are less impressive for the remaining species (Am, At, Cn) but Apis (all rho >
0.75, all P < 4.11E-05) and even Cryptococcus (all rho > 0.69,
all P < 5.56E-04) boast remarkably strong 5' correlations with
the vertebrates. Focusing on specific amino acid trends, isoleucine (I) stands out in that it is strongly preferred near 3'
boundaries across all species; others are well represented,
albeit not universal, through the entire phylogeny - for example, 5' avoidance of glutamine (Q), and 3' preference for phenylalanine (F).

The strong cross-species concordance in preference patterns
makes one observation all the more striking. The nematode 5'
spectra behave in a highly counterintuitive manner in that the
'mammalian pattern of directionality' is violated on several
occasions: where we do find significant trends in nematodes
and other species (E, K, L2, Q, R4, R2, T), all but glutamine
(Q) show discrepant directionality (Table 2). For example,
whereas lysine (K) is strongly preferred near boundaries in
vertebrates and some insects (Dm, Am), it appears to be
strongly avoided in the 5' region of nematode exons (Figure
2). Table 4 also underlines the exceptional position of nema-

todes: 5' correlations between nematodes and any other species are pervasively negative. No single correlation across all
amino acids is significantly different from zero applying the
adjusted significance threshold (P < 5.56E-04), owing to several trends collapsing into insignificance rather than fully
reversing sign. However, the pervasiveness of this pattern is
nonetheless noteworthy, especially considering that the same
is not the case for the 3' spectra where we find a coherent
agreement between nematodes and vertebrates (minimum
rho > 0.65, all significant at P < 5.92E-04) and only the twofold block of serine (S2) shows a reverse pattern of directionality among the significant trends for individual amino acids.

Many species obey an approximately symmetric
pattern of preference trends 5' and 3'

Amino acid trends are largely consistent with
participation in ESE motifs

This curious discrepancy between 5' and 3' spectra of amino
acid trends in nematodes led us to investigate further the relationship of 5' and 3' patterns across species. Considering all
amino acid trends simultaneously, rank correlations between
slope coefficients (5'~3') were computed. Furthermore, we
wanted to explicitly test the hypothesis that preference trends
show a 'symmetric' behavior, that is, that individual amino
acids exhibit preference trends of similar strength and direction at 5' and 3' ends. To this end, we carried out standardized
major axis regressions (SMA; see Materials and methods)
[21,22] for 5' versus 3' trends in each species and compared
the resulting regression line with one expected under perfect
symmetry (y = x). The results are given in Table 5 and
graphically represented in Figure 3. Human and mouse show
very substantial positive correlations between 5' and 3' preference trends (Hs, rho = 0.8528, P = 1.96E-06; Mm, rho =
0.8626, P = 2.28E-06). Although diminished in strength, we
also see significant correlations for Drosophila and Danio. As
expected from the previous analysis, correlations for nematodes are negative, albeit not significantly so (Ce, rho = 0.1413, P = 0.5185; Cb, rho = -0.4358, P = 0.0388). However,
the SMA results allow us to reject any notion of C. elegans or
C. briggsae adhering to a symmetric pattern of amino acid
usage, the respective confidence intervals (CIs) ruling out a
symmetry slope of β = 1 (CI (Ce), [-1.118; -0.7309]; CI (Cb), [0.7474; -0.5139]). No other species for which an SMA could
be carried out (Table 5; Materials and methods) deviate significantly from a symmetric model, although symmetry of
amino acid trends varies greatly and can only really be called
a defining characteristic of exon ends in vertebrates.

Intriguingly, asymmetries in the amino acid composition of
nematode exon ends appear to be mirrored by a corresponding asymmetry of regulatory motifs. Robinson [23], using a
computational approach to characterize candidate ESEs in C.
elegans, found that 5' and 3' ends were distinguished by different classes of consensus motifs. Crucially, he found purinerich human-like candidate motifs to be associated with 3'
ends but not 5' ends of nematode exons, which is broadly consistent with our observation that amino acids encoded by
purine-rich codons tend to be, in contrast to other animals,
disfavored at 5' ends (Table 2 and Figure 3).
For mammals, the prediction that amino acids preferred near
boundaries should correspond to those favored in ESEs was
tested by Parmley et al. [2]. The authors defined a metric that
quantifies the involvement of amino acids in splice enhancer
hexamers relative to the null expectation that every codon is
represented in ESEs around its genomic frequency. As predicted, these hexamer preference indices (HPIs), computed
for each amino acid grouping, were found to correlate with
preference trends, strongly preferred amino acids on average
associated with higher HPI values.
This relationship holds true for human as well as murine ESE
sets and amino acid trends, considering either rank correlation coefficients (rhox; Hs HPI~rhox, rho = -0.54, P <
0.00001, N = 46; Mm HPI~rhox, rho = -0.49, P = 0.0005, N
= 46) or the slope (β) of the fitted linear model (Hs HPI~β,
rho = -0.57, P < 0.0001, N = 46; Mm HPI~β, rho = -0.52, P =
0.0002, N = 46).

Figure symmetry in amino acid abundance trends comparing 5' and 3' exon ends within species
Variable3
Variable symmetry in amino acid abundance trends comparing 5' and 3' exon ends within species. Intraspecific correlations between the 5' (x-axis) and 3'
(y-axis) slopes as extracted from individually fitted linear models considering all 23 amino acid groupings are shown. Approximately symmetric
arrangements are particularly evident for some species (notably vertebrates) whereas nematode arrangements (Ce, Cb) are not symmetric. Further
notable is the higher variability of slope coefficients in some species (vertebrates and nematodes) vis-à-vis others (Am, At). Amino acids are represented by
their one letter code (two-fold blocks are denoted by '2'). The regression lines are from SMA regressions. Lines were not fitted for Arabidopsis,
Cryptococcus and S. cerevisiae given concerns about the adequacy of this technique for these datasets (see Materials and methods). For associated statistics
consult Table 5.

As expected from the demonstration that ESEs can act at varying distances from the splice site [14], human ESEs do not
exhibit a reading frame bias beyond what is expected from the
genomic frequencies of the underlying codons (Additional

data file 8). They can also, in principle, incorporate most
codons (Additional data file 8). In consequence, the defined
set of amino acids we find avoided or preferred are likely not
due to ultimate exclusion of certain codons but because dif-

ferent efficacy and specificity across ESEs mean that often
only a well-defined subset of codons can be used to specify the
desired ESE.
Unexpectedly, when we derived HPIs for zebrafish amino
acids, using a set of ESEs obtained from the same source [24],
we found a significant correlation of reverse sign (Dr
HPI~rhox (5'), rho = 0.6, P < 0.003, N = 46; HPI~rhox (3'),
rho = 0.59, P < 0.0033, N = 46). Many experimentally verified ESEs have been characterized as A-rich and C-poor relative to the background frequency of these nucleotides in
coding sequence. Whilst we found this to be the case for putative human ESE motifs not shared with zebrafish (A, 47.38%
(ESE) versus 25.57% (exonic); C, 15.28% versus 25.99%,
N(ESE) = 204), and for ESEs present in both species (A, 50%
versus 25.57%; C, 6.37% versus 25.99%, N = 34), unique
zebrafish ESEs (that is, ESEs not present in human) from this
dataset were unusually enriched in C (39.47% versus 25.99%,
N = 288) and relatively poor in A (18.40% versus 25.57%).
Although one would expect ESE motifs to vary across taxa,
the discrepancies are so pronounced as to sit awkwardly next
to the substantial similarities in amino acid trends (Tables 1
and 2). One criterion used by the Burge group [25] to identify
candidate ESE motifs was for such motifs to be more common
near weak versus strong splice sites. Therefore, one possible
explanation is that C-richness is a characteristic of zebrafish
ESEs near weak splice sites but not generally, so that the predicted ESEs are not representative of ESEs across the
zebrafish genome. Alternatively, comparatively lower quality
of the, then recent, zebrafish genome build might be responsible for the divergent results. A re-examination of these putative zebrafish ESEs with an updated genome build may be
worthwhile.

Reduced rates of evolution near the exon-intron
boundary in species where ESEs are essential
components of the splicing machinery
To further advance the hypothesis that gradients in amino
acid abundance near exon-intron boundaries are a critical
feature of exon ends in metazoans, we examined the degree of
amino acid conservation as a function of distance from the
boundary. For three pairs of species (S. cerevisiae-Saccharomyces castellii, D. melanogaster-Drosophila pseudoobscura
(Dps); C. elegans-C. briggsae) sets of orthologous internal
exons were derived from various sources and aligned at the
amino acid level (see Materials and methods). Mirroring
results from a comparison of human-mouse orthologues [2],
we found strong and highly significant positive correlations of
strikingly linear character (Figure 4) between distance from
the boundary and amino acid substitution rate for the Drosophila and Caenorhabditis pairs, whilst proximity to the
boundary did not appear to confer a higher level of amino acid
conservation in the Saccharomyces comparison. Restricting
the analysis to exons of at least 70 codons in length, we
obtained qualitatively equivalent results (Drosophilae 5', rho
= 0.53, P < 0.002, N = 3,690; Drosophilae 3', rho = 0.77, P =

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R29

Warnecke et al. R29.9

9.70E-07, N = 3,690; Caenorhabdites 5', rho = 0.74, P =
2.33E-06, N = 6,273; Caenorhabdites 3', rho = 0.58, P = 4.5E04, N = 6,273). This restriction ensures that all exons contribute an approximately equal share of information to each
codon position from the boundary and eliminates the potential confounder that short exons might, for reasons unrelated
to splicing, feature more frequently in highly conserved genes
and create misleading trends by virtue of their disproportionate contribution to substitution rate information closer to the
boundary.
Given that the set of aligned Saccharomyces exons consisted
entirely of terminal exons (see Materials and methods), we
repeated the analysis for a set of 5,352 orthologous pairs of
terminal exons from our Drosophila dataset in order to rule
out that differences are caused by any special characteristics
of terminal exons. Correlations observed for terminal exons
closely resemble those for internal exons (5', rho = 0.83, P =
3.8E-07; 3', rho = 0.75, P = 1.95E-06), alleviating any such
concerns.
The above results appear consistent with greater functional
significance of boundary-proximal amino acid composition in
metazoans, proposed to be at least in part owing to their more
extensive utilization of exonic splice regulatory sequences.
However, after repeated (k = 10,000) random sampling of 90
aligned terminal exons from the Drosophila dataset and subsequent statistical analysis, we cannot reject the possibility
that the Saccharomyces statistics were sampled from the
same underlying distribution (Additional data file 9),
implying that differences in conservation near exon-intron
boundaries cannot be ultimately established from the data at
hand.
Having detected higher levels of amino acid conservation
near exon-intron boundaries, we expect genes with a high
proportion of sequences near boundaries ('flank-heavy') to
evolve more slowly. This is indeed what we found when we
considered KA as a function of the proportion of sequence
within 70 bp of the boundary (Drosophilae, rho = -0.26, P =
2.2E-16, N = 4,132; Caenorhabdites, rho = -0.08, P = 6.18E09, N = 5,248; Figure 5). We report KA rather than KA/KS,
more commonly used as a measure of selection on protein
sequence, because the underlying premise of KA/KS, namely
that KS reflects neutral rates of evolution, is violated for
sequence encoding ESEs [26].
The results are not qualitatively affected by contracting (50
bp) or expanding (100 bp) the region considered to constitute
the boundary flank (Additional data file 10). Focusing on the
terminal bins in Figure 5a, it appears that between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura a gene with less than 10% of
coding sequence near an exon-intron boundary evolves, on
average, almost twice as fast (mean KA = 0.195) as a gene with
more than 70% of boundary-proximal sequence (mean KA =
0.099). Discrepancies in evolutionary rate between 'flank-

linear. Location-dependent conservation levels also appear slightly higher near the boundary comparing (c) S. cerevisiae-S. castellii but this is not significant
(5', rho = 0.11, P = 0.55, N = 51; 3', rho = 0.11, P = 0.55, N = 39; pooled 3'/5', rho = 0.12, P = 0.51, N = 90) or of comparable monotony (but see
Additional data file 9).

heavy' and 'core-heavy' bins appear less marked for the
nematode pair (mean KA (%CDS near boundary >0.9) = 0.12;
mean KA (%CDS near boundary <0.3) = 0.18). However, Figure 5b suggests that this is principally owing to curiously elevated levels of conservation for genes with a small proportion
of sequence near the boundary, that is, genes with very large
exons, a feature we did not encounter in the analysis of either
insect (Dm-Dps) or mammalian (Hs-Mm) orthologues [2].
Importantly, this anomaly highlights a more general reservation, namely that any measure capturing the proportion of
sequence near the boundary will strongly covary with exon
length, which in turn might covary with underlying functional
determinants of evolutionary rate entirely unrelated to splic-

ing control. Thus, in order to control for any putatively distorting effects of functional class on KA, we employed the
following strategy: For each aligned gene, we concatenated
the flanking regions of all exons, 5' and 3', defined as the first
72 bp bordering the exon-intron junction of trimmed exons.
By implication, genes with no exon larger than 144 bp had to
be excluded from this analysis. Concurrently, we concatenated the core sections of all exons of sufficient length in the
respective gene, defined as the sequence block enclosed by
the two flanking regions. As accurate estimation of KA probably requires a minimum of 100 codons, we further restricted
analysis to those genes with at least 300 bp in the concatenated flanks and in the concatenated cores of exons. For each
gene meeting the above criteria we then determined the rates

of amino acid evolution in the concatenated core sections
(KAc) and flanking sections (KAf). We find that more Drosophila orthologous genes than expected by chance have
faster evolving core regions (median (KAc - KAf)/KAf) = 0.14,
Wilcoxon signed rank test P < 0.0001, N = 1,237; Figure 6),
consistent with the evidence, presented above, for additional
sequence constraint operating on flanking regions. A significant tendency towards more rapid evolution in core sections
is also evident when we confine the sample to genes with at
least 600 bp in flanking as well as core regions (median (KAc KAf)/KAf) = 0.14, Wilcoxon signed rank test P < 0.0001, N =
785). Despite exhibiting the expected shift towards average
higher KA in the core of exons, this trend is much less pronounced than in a previously reported comparison of humanmouse orthologues (median (KAc - KAf)/KAf) = 0.68, Wilcoxon
signed rank test P < 0.0001, N = 360; Figure 6c, and see
Parmley et al. [2] for details). Curiously, for the nematode
pair, we find significant evidence for a reverse correlation
(300 bp, median (KAc - KAf)/KAf) = -0.07, Wilcoxon signed
rank test P < 0.0001, N = 1,102; 600 bp, median (KAc - KAf)/
KAf) = -0.014, P < 0.038, N = 496), that is, in the majority of
genes, flanking regions evolve at a marginally higher rate than
core regions.

Discussion
General trends
Parmley et al. [2] recently presented evidence that, in mammals, amino acid usage in the vicinity of exon-intron boundaries is affected by factors unrelated to protein function but to
sequence-based information required for correct splicing.
The objective of the present study was to elucidate whether
such requirements have left an evolutionary imprint on
exonic sequence composition across a phylogenetically
diverse set of species. To this end, we systematically compared trends in relative amino acid abundance near exonintron boundaries in 12 eukaryotic species. Our analysis
revealed that preference for or avoidance of certain amino
acids near boundaries is a common phenomenon among
metazoan species but is not unique to metazoans. More
amino acids show skewed usage in species where a greater
problem identifying intron-exon boundaries is to be
expected, that is, those with large and numerous introns.
Notably, this includes the basidiomycete C. neoformans, suggesting that exonic splicing regulation might be a generic
characteristic of species with complex pre-mRNA structures
rather than absent from the fungal kingdom by virtue of phylogeny. Preference patterns show unmistakable signs of conservation along several dimensions: composition, relative

strength, and directionality. The concordance in directionality (whether an amino acid is preferred or avoided) is particularly impressive in that we observe many commonalities
with the mammalian pattern even in only distantly related
species.

We do not claim that the systematic patterns we observe are
solely caused by a selected preference for codons involved in
ESEs. In fact, composite trends are almost certain to be the
result of multiple functional constraints, including the need
to avoid intron-specific enhancer motifs (for example GGG in

mammals [25]) as well as motifs that would disrupt exon recognition. Furthermore, abundance trends could partially be
the result of cryptic splice site avoidance as suggested by
Eskesen and colleagues [27]. However, many of the trends
observed - for example, cytosine avoidance near boundaries are not predicted by this model [2,11].
Introns associate non-randomly with the codon in direct
proximity to the splice site in a phase-specific manner, an
observation often described as insertional preference [28].
Trimming and elimination of the first full codon should guard
against picking up such insertional preferences or an
extended splice site consensus. We cannot rule out that some
boundary-proximal codons have slipped into our dataset
owing to poor splice site annotation. However, it must be
pointed out that this reservation applies only to the subset of
amino acid trends that show biased usage directly adjacent to
introns and might be more relevant to the interpretation of
local discontinuities (Additional data file 11). Also, if the
above-mentioned explanations were of major relevance, we
would expect cryptic splice site avoidance, insertional preference, and (to a lesser extent) poor splice site annotation to
cause similar patterns in ascomycetous yeasts, in particular S.
pombe, for which a dataset of reasonable size is available.
This is not the case.
Establishing to what extent these trends are caused by preference for ESEs will ultimately depend on characterizing species-specific catalogues of ESE/Exonic splicing silencer (ESS)
motifs together with their corresponding trans-factors and
relating these to the observed spectra of preferred/avoided
amino acids. This work, in particular relating to tissue- and
stage-specific splicing patterns, is still in its infancy [29], the
catalogues currently available restricted to a small number of
vertebrates and yet to be fully verified experimentally [30,31].
However, the dearth of significant trends in S. cerevisiae and
S. pombe strengthens the proposition that preference trends
principally reflect requirements to accommodate exonic
splicing regulators. Although the S. cerevisiae genome codes
for an SR protein kinase (Sky1p) with the capacity to phosphorylate mammalian arginine-serine rich (RS) domains, the
likely endogenous substrate (the SR protein-like Npl3p) does
not appear to be involved in pre-mRNA splicing [3,32].
Importantly, no splicing factors homologous to metazoan SR
proteins have been discovered in S. cerevisiae [14], consistent
with the classical view that splicing in budding yeast is regulated intronically. This is further consistent with the observation that splice site consensus is generally highly conserved,
especially 5', much more so than in other species, including C.
neoformans (Additional data file 5). The fact that our analysis
revealed a significant 3' trend for the two-fold block of leucine
(L2) might hint at the presence of recognition motifs in yeast
exonic sequence. However, at present there is no evidence
supporting the regular involvement of an ESE-like binding

motif in S. cerevisiae splicing and alternative explanations
should be considered.
Splicing in S. cerevisiae is moderately common in quantitative terms because many highly expressed genes, notably
encoding ribosomal proteins, contain introns, so that over
25% of the mRNA population are spliced [33]. However, in
over 6,000 S. cerevisiae genes we find less than 300 introns
in total, so that splicing can hardly be considered a processing
stage representative on a genome-wide scale. In contrast,
splicing is much more prevalent in S. pombe where approximately 40% of genes contain introns [34]. Basal splicing proteins show an enhanced similarity to their mammalian
homologues and two SR protein homologues (Srp1p, Srp2p)
have been identified [35-37]. Unlike in budding yeast, there is
recent evidence that Srp2p binds to specific exonic elements
and interacts with the fission yeast orthologue of human
splice factor U2AF [38]. Why then, given that SR proteinESE-like interactions seem to exist in S. pombe, do we not
find any trends for amino acid or codon preference in this
species? We suggest that trends may be lacking for two reasons. Firstly, given the comparatively low level of splice site
consensus degeneracy, a minimal number of ESEs might be
sufficient to ensure correct splicing. On a genomic level, we
might then fail to register biased abundance patterns on the
spatial scale investigated in this study. Secondly, for clear-cut
preference trends to evolve, a minimum level of splice-regulatory complexity might be required. This fits with our observation that more amino acid trends are observed in species
with complex, intron-rich gene structures, including the yeast
C. neoformans (Additional data file 6). Further, alternative
splicing contexts, where regulatory elements frequently compete for precedence if arranged close to each other, could be
envisaged as an evolutionary pressure initially driving the
diversification of ESEs and corresponding trans-factors,
thereby creating an environment in which strong trends
might be required to attract or repel the correct set of transfactors, both for constitutively and alternatively spliced
genes. Consistent with this hypothesis, reports of alternative
splicing in S. cerevisiae [39] and S. pombe [40] are restricted
to singular cases, for which functionality of the recovered
alternative splice products remains to be shown [41]. However, attempts to link diversity and density of ESEs to alternative splicing have so far yielded ambiguous results [42].
The absence of preference patterns in ascomycetous yeasts
has an important practical implication. Finding amino acid
trends to be abundant near exon-intron boundaries can be
regarded as evidence for exon-based splicing regulation,
without prior knowledge of specific binding motifs or transfactors, although failure to detect such trends is insufficient to
rule out interaction between exons and auxiliary proteins in
the splicing process (compare S. pombe).

Nematode exceptionalism in an ESE framework: is
trans-splicing to blame?
The fundamental deviation from the 'mammalian pattern of
directionality' shown by the 5' amino acid trends in nematode
exons (Table 1) might, at first sight, be unexpected. There are
extensive homologies between vertebrate and nematode
basal splicing machineries on the protein level [13]. Furthermore, splicing in SR protein-depleted cells of the Caenorrhabditis relative Ascaris lumbricoides can be rescued by
adding SR proteins derived from non-nematode (HeLa)
whole cell extracts, supporting at least a minimum degree of
functional overlap [43]. Thirdly, the high level of conservation between SR and SR-like proteins identified in each species explicitly includes the RNA recognition motifs,
tentatively suggesting similar binding specificities [44].
There is, however, one feature of the nematode splicing process that sets it apart from the other species in our sample: a
substantial proportion (approximately 70%) of C. elegans
(and C. briggsae) genes are trans-spliced [45]. In this process
a short (22 nucleotide) 5' small nuclear RNA (snRNA) fragment, the spliced leader, which is transcribed from a different
genomic locale, is added at the 5' end of the pre-mRNA [46].
It would, we suggest, be highly disadvantageous for this
trans-splicing machinery to act at the 5' end of exons where
cis-splicing should occur. Indeed, were trans-splicing to
occur where intron removal should take place, a gene would,
in effect, be broken in two. Thus, we suggest that 5' ends of
internal exons have evolved to ensure that they do not attract
the trans-splicing machinery. Given that this machinery is
ubiquitous in a cell, all 5' ends of internal exons, be they from
trans-spliced genes or not, should be equally under pressure
to avoid trans-splicing where cis-splicing should happen.
Consistent with this expectation, the trends seen at 5' and 3'
ends in internal exons are the same in genes from operons
and those not in operons (data not shown). Interestingly,
information content at 3' splice sites in nematodes is strikingly higher than in other species (Additional data file 5), as
previously observed [47], further supporting the idea that
splicing regulation in nematodes is unusual in its asymmetry.
What might be the proteins involved in trans-splicing? There
is good evidence that several stages of the trans-splicing
process are, like cis-splicing, critically supported by SR proteins [43,48]. Furthermore, whilst mammalian and Ascaris
SR protein extracts are equally efficient in catalyzing cissplicing in vitro, Ascaris SR protein extracts engender an
approximately five-fold higher trans-splicing activity [43].
Although the use of whole cell extracts in these experiments
precludes an analysis of the differential contribution of individual SR proteins, these observations are consistent with the
hypothesis that a subset of splice-regulatory proteins in these
species is dedicated to trans-splicing.
Given the above, we envisage trans-splicing specific SR and
other proteins to interact primarily with intergenic sequence

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R29

Warnecke et al. R29.14

upstream of the first exon of the pre-mRNA to provide further
guidance for the trans-splicing apparatus or mediate other
functions crucial to trans-splicing, such as protecting downstream RNA from degradation [45,49]. A prediction derived
from this model is that we should find in nematodes proteins
participating in trans-splicing that bind to nucleotide motifs
depleted of codons from amino acids avoided near the 5' end
of exons.

Symmetric exons?
Owing to their deviant 5' trends, nematodes stand out in
another aspect of systematic amino acid biases. Parmley et al.
[2] observed no significant differences in preference trends
between 5' and 3' ends of exons in mammals. Similarly,
approximate symmetry has been reported for ESE distribution in human exons [30]. Conversely, standardized major
axis regressions [21,22] strongly suggest that nematodes do
not conform to a symmetric pattern of preference trends.
An assessment of this situation very much depends on how we
expect ESE-guided splicing regulation to work on a mechanistic level. If SR proteins are assumed to interact directly
with specific components of the basal splicing machinery, as
is probably the case for U2AF [3], we would not automatically
expect the same ESEs (and by implication amino acid trends)
to be represented at similar frequencies 5' and 3' where different spliceosomal proteins are present. Predictions of whether
symmetry might be of functional relevance, however, especially for scenarios of indirect interaction, cannot be derived
from the data at hand.
Confidence intervals in our exploration of symmetry are large
so that we cannot ascertain that symmetry is a dominant pattern throughout our species sample. However, some best estimates of SMA slopes (β) are tantalizingly close to perfect
symmetry (Mm, β = 0.9907; Hs, β = 1.0362; Dr, β = 1.0439;
Ag, β = 1.0788; Table 5), warranting more detailed examination of this potentially functional signature in the future.

Patterns of amino acid evolution
Consistent with the proposition that trends in relative amino
acid abundance are functionally important, we observe lower
rates of nonsynonymous evolution near exon-intron boundaries in insects (Dm-Dps), nematodes (Ce-Cb) and mammals
(Hs-Mm), indicative of higher selective constraint in this
region. Furthermore, the proportion of coding sequence that
is located near boundaries is a partial predictor of KA (Figure
5). Genes with a higher share of sequence partaking in exon
flanks tend to show reduced rates of evolution. Nematode
genes, again, stand out in that they do not conform to the negative linear relationship between KA and flank-heaviness
found in other species pairs (Hs-Mm and Dm-Dps), but show
unexpectedly high levels of conservation for genes with very
large exons. The causes for this currently remain elusive. Similarly, we would not have predicted that in worms gene-specific differences between evolutionary rate in the flanking and

Genome Biology 2008, 9:R29

http://genomebiology.com/2008/9/2/R29

Genome Biology 2008,

core sections of exons are biased (if only slightly) towards
more rapid evolution of flanking regions. However, the distribution of core-flank evolutionary rate differentials in worms
appears comparable to the one for flies, a higher median evolutionary rate of core regions in the latter notwithstanding
(Figure 6). Human-mouse orthologous genes on the other
hand show a much more dramatic distributional shift
towards faster evolution in exon cores (see distributions in
Figure 6). Between-taxa differences in gene composition,
especially relating to the presence of more and longer introns
in mammals, might account for these differences: on a speculative note, information necessary to distinguish an exon
from surrounding non-coding sequence might require a
unique degree of conservation under these circumstances,
perhaps severely restricting the leeway for nonsynonymous
changes to occur in flanking regions. Alternatively,
restrictions imposed by our experimental set-up, especially
relating to minimum sequence length requirements, might
have resulted in the selection of gene sets with divergent
splicing characteristics in the different species pairs. We leave
a closer dissection of these questions to further analysis.

Conclusion

Biased usage of amino acids in the vicinity of exon-intron
boundaries is a common feature in metazoan genes, with the
direction of biases largely consistent between taxa. That the
biases accord with sequence preferences of SR proteins and
that such biases are not seen in intron-poor yeasts support
the view that dual coding of DNA in exons, to specify both
which amino acids to employ and where introns are to be
removed, is a common feature of metazoan species and more
generally in genomes in which exons are relatively small
islands in a sea of intronic sequences in the immature mRNA.
Interestingly, similar skews in amino acid composition can be
observed for the intron-rich fungus C. neoformans,
suggesting that exonic splicing regulation might occur in this
species. In nematodes, the possible relationship between
trans-splicing and the exceptional departure from the
mammalian pattern of amino acid trends at the 5' end of
exons deserves further scrutiny. The results presented here
suggest a simple sequence-based, species-independent diagnostic for the relative importance of exonic splicing regulation in a particular species given nothing more than a wellannotated genome.

Materials and methods
Relative amino acid abundance near exon-intron
boundaries
For 12 species (human, mouse, zebrafish, C. elegans, C.
briggsae, A. gambiae, D. melanogaster, A. mellifera, A. thaliana, S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, C. neoformans) we established
individual exon datasets derived from a small number of
databases (Additional data file 12). Pre-established CDS
tracks were followed in all but three cases (At, Sp, Cn), for

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R29

Warnecke et al. R29.15

which annotated chromosome/scaffold sequences were
downloaded from the relevant database and exons extracted
subsequently. Exons with identical locus IDs were then sorted
into individual files, only retaining files with at least one
internal exon. All locus files were subsequently checked to
ensure coding sequence started with ATG, finished with a
stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA), had no internal stop codons,
and was a multiple of three nucleotides. Locus files where one
of the above prerequisites was violated were removed from
the final dataset. We also eliminated exons containing one or
more ambiguous nucleotides ('n'). The remaining exons were
trimmed so that the first nucleotide was the first nucleotide of
the first complete codon and the last nucleotide the last of the
final complete codon. Then, we discarded all terminal exons
to obtain the final exon sets. Gene models from which exons
were derived are provided in Additional data file 13.
After splitting individual exons in half to ensure that no codon
featured in both 5' and 3' analyses, we considered the trend in
usage of each amino acid as a function of the distance from
the boundary up to a maximum distance of 34 codons. Importantly, the codon in direct proximity to the boundary was also
eliminated.
We then calculated Spearman rank correlations (rho)
between the distance from the boundary (5' or 3') and proportional usage of the amino acid (that is, in proportion to the
number of residues at that given distance) for the remaining
33 data points for each species. The three six-fold degenerate
amino acids we split into blocks of four and two (that is, 'S4'
signifies, TCA, TCC, TCG and TCT, while 'S2' signifies AGC
and AGT). In relevant circumstances, the two-fold and fourfold blocks were treated as separate amino acids, yielding a
total of 23 amino acid groupings.
For each amino acid grouping independently we fitted
unweighted linear models and extracted the slope of the
regression line to be used as a basic measure of the strength
of individual preference trends. Note that a negative rho/
slope implies an amino acid that is preferred near boundaries
and a positive rho/slope implies a tendency to be avoided.
Unless otherwise stated, results are reported as significant
only if they remain significant after correction for multiple
testing (see Results for adjusted P-values).
For the most part, trends are approximately monotonic and
linear and hence adequately captured by simple linear models. For certain amino acids, departures from linearity, some
recurrent across species and typically highly localized, do
exist however. Unusual U-shaped 5' trends for proline, originally noted for human and mouse by Parmley et al. [2], are
also present in other species (Ce, Dr). Further, some amino
acids, notably isoleucine and the two-fold block of leucine, are
disproportionately preferred in direct proximity to the
boundary (after trimming) at 3' exon ends in several species.
'Popping out' from otherwise linear trends (Additional data

file 14), these patterns are perhaps caused by participation of
the relevant codons in an extended splice site consensus relevant for U5 snRNA-mediated exon joining (see Additional
data file 11 for a more detailed discussion of recurrent, locally
confined preference/avoidance patterns and potential functional explanations). As a corollary of discontinuities more
generally, comparative interpretation of slope coefficients as
an index of relative strength ought to be done with care. In
particular, our rank ordering of slopes derives its value from
providing another dimension through which congruence in
preference spectra can be asserted, rather than being easily
translated into differential functional impact on a mechanistic level.

Modifications in the analysis of S. cerevisiae exons
Given the small number of internal exons in S. cerevisiae
(only eight genes have more than one intron), we decided to
include terminal exons in the final dataset (417 exons) for this
species. The one end of each terminal exon that did not border the intron was excluded. Otherwise, the removal of irregularities (internal stop codons and so on) proceeded as
described above. Restricted sample size also indirectly
prompted a re-examination of the results obtained from
Spearman's rank correlations because the presence of multiple tied ranks led to concerns about the adequacy of this statistic. However, using the more appropriate Kendall's tau
statistic did not return any qualitatively different results.

Cross-species patterns in preference across all amino
acid groupings
For 5' and 3' datasets independently, Spearman's correlations
were computed between the previously derived slope coefficients of all 23 amino acid groupings for every possible metazoan species pair. Ninety tests (with the number of species N
= 10, N^2-N = 90) were carried out and significance
threshold adjusted accordingly (P = 0.05/90 = 5.56E-04). We
initially included both yeast species in the analysis but, as
expected from the absence of significant individual amino
acid trends, we found no significant correlations for the global
amino acid set (data not shown). No loss of relevant information is incurred whilst clarity of presentation is enhanced
when these species are excluded from the analysis and, in particular, the accompanying table (Table 5).

Comparison of orthologous exons
S. cerevisiae-S. castellii
A set of S. cerevisiae-S. castellii orthologous genes, based on
a re-annotation of the S. castellii genome by Wolfe and colleagues, were obtained from the Yeast Gene Order Browser
[50]. For each S. cerevisiae gene that contributed exons to our
analysis of amino acid abundance, we checked whether a
homologous S. castellii gene was present on the same positional track, the rationale being to compare true orthologues
rather than outparalogues. If putatively orthologous gene
pairs were found on both tracks, implying the retention of two
post-genome duplication paralogues in both species, only the

Volume 9, Issue 2, Article R29

Warnecke et al. R29.16

pair on track 1 was considered. This procedure yielded 164
orthologue pairs. S. castellii open reading frame structure
downloaded from the same source was used to eliminate all S.
castellii genes that lacked any introns, did not have a regular
start or stop codon, or whose exon sequence was not a multiple of three nucleotides. Further discarding all genes with
unequal exon number or unequal intron phase between species, 51 gene pairs (102 exons) remained. We further eliminated all exons shorter than eight amino acids in length as
these were considered uninformative. After trimming (see
above) codons were translated into amino acids and orthologous exons aligned using MUSCLE (version 3.6) [51]. After
alignment, the first and last amino acid of each exon were
removed. Exons were then split in half so that any one amino
acid features exclusively in either 5' or 3' analysis. We then
calculated the number of amino acid changes over the total
number of informative (amino acid present in both species)
sites for each amino acid position from the boundary,
including only exon ends that bordered an intron (that is, only
the 3' end for the first exon and only the 5' end for the last
exon).
Spearman's and Kendall's rank correlations between distance
from the boundary and the proportion of amino acids
changed were computed for 5' and 3' ends separately. Given
the small sample sizes for end-specific analyses (N(5') = 51,
N(3') = 39), we also computed rank correlations for 5' and 3'
ends pooled. Linear models were fitted for each analysis,
weighting by the number of informative sites at distance x
from the boundary.

D. melanogaster-D. pseudoobscura
A list of D. melanogaster-D. pseudoobscura orthologous
genes was obtained from the Inparanoid database [52]. D.
pseudoobscura exons were downloaded from the flybaseGene track on the UCSC genome browser [53] and sorted into
files by gene locus, eliminating genes with irregularities as
described above. Using the orthologue list we established a
set of 4,165 orthologue pairs for which genes were present in
the cleaned datasets of both species; 2,677 gene pairs (comprising 7,545 orthologous internal exon pairs, and 5,352
orthologous terminal exon pairs) remain after checking for
equal exon number and intron phase. Trimming of exons,
alignment and statistical analysis were carried out as
described for S. cerevisiae-S. castellii. The 3' and 5' ends were
considered for each internal exon, whereas only exon ends
bordering an intron were included in the analysis of terminal
exons.

C. elegans-C. briggsae
Each C. elegans locus file was translated into protein and queried against a database of all translated C. briggsae locus files
using BLAST (blastp), and vice versa. Only reciprocal best
hits with an expectation E ≤ 1 were retained. After checking
for equal exon number and intron phase, 5,358 orthologous
gene pairs (19,347 orthologous internal exon pairs) remained.

Trimming and alignment were carried out as described above
for Drosophila. Orthologues for all comparative species are
given in Additional data file 13.

Intraspecific 5'~3' correlations and symmetry analysis
Covering all 23 amino acid groupings Spearman's rank correlations were computed between 5' and 3' trends within each
species (N = 12, P = 0.05/12 = 4.17E-03).
SMA regressions were computed in R using the SMATR package [21,22] applying standard confidence limits (95% CI). As
symmetry of the type x = y was to be tested, the regression line
was forced through the origin. SMA regression requires estimates of the slope of the regression line to have a consistently
positive or negative sign so that the major and minor axes can
be identified unambiguously. This is not the case for either A.
thaliana or C. neoformans, which are hence not amenable to
this type of analysis and were not included. Further, residual
distribution for S. cerevisiae shows significant deviation from
normality so that results for this species should be interpreted
with care.
