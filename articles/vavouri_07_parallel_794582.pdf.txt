Abstract

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R15

information

Conclusion: A core set of genes that regulate development is associated with CNEs across three
animal groups (worms, flies and vertebrates). We propose that these CNEs reflect the parallel
evolution of alternative enhancers for a common set of developmental regulatory genes in different
animal groups. This 're-wiring' of gene regulatory networks containing key developmental
coordinators was probably a driving force during the evolution of animal body plans. CNEs may,
therefore, represent the genomic traces of these 'hard-wired' core gene regulatory networks that
specify the development of each alternative animal body plan.

interactions

Results: Here we report that nematode genomes contain an alternative set of CNEs that share
sequence characteristics, but not identity, with their vertebrate counterparts. CNEs thus represent
a very unusual class of sequences that are extremely conserved within specific animal lineages yet
are highly divergent between lineages. Nematode CNEs are also associated with developmental
regulatory genes, and include well-characterized enhancers and transcription factor binding sites,
supporting the proposed function of CNEs as cis-regulatory elements. Most remarkably, 40 of 156
human CNE-associated genes with invertebrate orthologs are also associated with CNEs in both
worms and flies.

refereed research

Background: The human genome contains thousands of non-coding sequences that are often
more conserved between vertebrate species than protein-coding exons. These highly conserved
non-coding elements (CNEs) are associated with genes that coordinate development, and have
been proposed to act as transcriptional enhancers. Despite their extreme sequence conservation
in vertebrates, sequences homologous to CNEs have not been identified in invertebrates.

Background

Comparisons of the human genome against the genomes of
distantly related vertebrates have revealed an abundance of
highly conserved non-coding elements (CNEs) that appear to
have been 'frozen' throughout vertebrate evolution [1-7]. The
exact number of elements shared between any set of species
varies depending on the precise definition of similarity and
the divergence of the genomes used. For example, a comparison of the human genome against the mouse and the rat
genomes revealed that all three share 256 elements with no
evidence of transcription that are 100% identical over at least
200 base-pairs (bp) [2]. Furthermore, the human genome
and the genome of the Japanese pufferfish (Fugu rubripes),
which diverged from a common ancestor approximately 450
million years ago (MYA), share 1,373 CNEs, with an average
length of 199 bp and average identity of 84% [4].
A striking property of human CNEs is that they cluster in
genomic regions that contain genes coding for transcription
factors and signaling genes involved in the regulation of
development ('trans-dev' genes) [2-4,6]. Therefore, CNEs
have been proposed to act as cis-regulatory sequences for
these trans-dev genes. In support of this, where tested, the
majority of assayed CNEs can act as tissue-specific enhancers
for a transgene in zebrafish or mice [4,7-10].
Vertebrate CNEs show extreme sequence conservation
among distantly related species, often showing higher conservation than protein-coding exons [4,5]. However, there
appear to be no traces of vertebrate CNEs in invertebrate
genomes that can be identified by sequence similarity
searches [2,4,11]. The evolutionary origin of most vertebrate
CNEs therefore remains unknown [11]. Although CNEs have
also been identified in invertebrate genomes [12-14], they
have been found to be smaller and less frequent than vertebrate CNEs. Recently, Glazov et al. [13] identified 20,301
non-coding elements that are conserved over at least 50 bp
between the very closely related genomes of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura and showed that
these elements were also found preferentially near genes
encoding transcription factors and developmental regulatory
genes. D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura diverged from
their common ancestor 25 to 55 MYA [15] and show sequence
divergence similar to that between the human and mouse
genomes [13]. Consequently, it is difficult to distinguish functionally conserved elements from background sequence conservation by comparing these two genomes alone. In fact,
only two of these elements were conserved in the more distantly related genome of Anopheles gambiae, which shared a
common ancestor with the Drosophila species approximately
250 MYA [16]. Therefore, it is still unclear how widespread
highly conserved non-coding elements are among different
animal genomes and whether similar genes are associated
with the most conserved non-coding elements in both invertebrate and vertebrate genomes.

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/2/R15

To provide further insight into the function and evolution of
CNEs, we have focused on the simplest animal group for
which multiple genome sequences are currently available.
Two nematode genomes, Caenorhabditis elegans and
Caenorhabditis briggsae have been fully sequenced and
assembled [17,18]. These two species diverged from a common ancestor approximately 80 to 110 MYA [18]. Although C.
elegans and C. briggsae diverged at a similar time as human
and mouse, the neutral substitution rate estimated for these
two Caenorhabditis genomes is roughly three-fold higher
than for human-mouse [18], so providing a substantial period
of evolutionarily divergence between these species. Whole
genome shotgun sequence has also been released recently for
a third nematode genome, C. remanei. C. remanei is a sister
species of C. briggsae, and these two genomes show sequence
divergence similar to that between the human and mouse
genomes [19].
The CNEs that we have identified in C. elegans have many
properties that mirror those of vertebrate CNEs. Although
smaller than vertebrate CNEs, worm CNEs also reside near
developmental regulatory genes. Moreover, they share both a
striking base composition transition signal and a similar A+T
content with vertebrate CNEs. Worm CNEs identify many
previously characterized transcriptional enhancers and transcription factor binding sites. Most strikingly, we find that
vertebrate and invertebrate CNEs are often associated with
orthologous genes. Our analysis indicates that CNEs are commonly associated with the same developmental genes in different animal groups. Therefore, it seems likely that CNEs
evolved in parallel in different animal lineages to regulate the
expression of a core set of regulatory genes. The extreme
sequence conservation of CNEs likely reflects the functional
importance of these elements as components of the gene regulatory networks that define each different evolutionarily stable animal body plan.

Results
Identification of worm conserved non-coding elements
To identify highly conserved non-coding elements in the
genome of C. elegans, we searched for sequences that contain
large blocks of identity with the genome of C. briggsae and
show no evidence of transcription. We used MegaBlast (with
soft masking, e-value threshold of 0.001 and with the rest of
the parameters set to the default values) to identify sequences
that contain at least 30 (word seed size 30, W30) to 100 (word
seed size 100, W100) consecutive nucleotides identical
between the two nematode genomes, and removed any elements overlapping protein-coding exons, non-coding RNAs
or repetitive sequences (see Materials and methods for
details). We identified no non-coding elements with W100, 19
elements with W75, 304 elements with W50, 746 elements
with W40 and 3,061 elements with W30. All further analysis
was carried out on the W30 set. Of these elements, 69% are
also found in the early draft genome sequence of C. remanei.

information

Vertebrate CNEs have a characteristic pattern of nucleotide
composition, showing a sharp base composition change at
their boundaries [22]. Fugu and human CNEs contain 59%
and 62% A+T nucleotides [22], respectively, which is 6% and
3% above the genome averages [23,24]. A gradual G+C
enrichment followed by a sharp AT-rich peak at the CNE
boundaries marks the transition of base composition from the
flanking DNA to the CNE DNA (Figure 2). The genome of C.
elegans has increased A+T content (65%) compared to vertebrates. Yet wCNEs have an A+T content very similar to vertebrate CNEs (58%). Moreover, we find that worm CNEs also
show a similar nucleotide frequency transition at their borders: there is a decrease of A+T content from the genome
average (65%) down to 50% at the wCNE border followed by
a sharp increase to 58% within the wCNE (Figure 2). Furthermore, the same signal is present at the boundaries of CNEs
from D. melanogaster (Figure 2d) [25] (T Down, personal
communication). The significance of this signal remains
unknown, although its conservation from nematodes to

interactions

wCNEs are not distributed evenly along the chromosomes of
C. elegans. Rather, they tend to reside in the gene-rich centers
of the autosomes (Additional data files 1 and 2) and, as with
human CNEs (hCNEs) [2-4], multiple wCNEs are often clustered around a single gene (mean of 1.7 and maximum of 14
wCNEs per gene). Moreover, 884 out of 2,084 wCNEs
(42.4%) are found on the single C. elegans sex chromosome,
which is more than expected by chance (p value < 0.001,
based on 1,000 randomizations; Figure 1). The C. elegans sex
chromosome is almost devoid of essential genes, and is
instead enriched for genes with regulatory functions [20].
The enrichment of wCNEs on the X chromosome may, there-

fore, result from more of the genes on X requiring complex
cis-regulatory architectures. This enrichment for CNEs on the
X chromosome may also explain the larger synteny blocks
that are observed on the X chromosome than on the autosomes in C. elegans [21]. In vertebrates it has been proposed
that the requirement to maintain linkage between CNEs and
their target genes places a constraint on chromosomal rearrangements [10] and this may also be occurring on the C. elegans X chromosome.

deposited research

We refer to these non-coding sequences conserved in all three
genomes as worm CNEs (wCNEs), which comprise 1,460
intergenic elements with no evidence of transcription and
624 elements located in introns covering, in total, approximately 144 kb. These wCNEs have a mean length of 69 bp
(minimum 30 bp, maximum 432 bp, median 59 bp) and a
mean identity of 96% between C. elegans and C. briggsae
with 990 elements being 100% identical between all three
species. Using the PhastCons method [14], 93% of the total
sequence contained in wCNEs is estimated to be under purifying selection rather than to be evolving neutrally. Moreover,
this figure is probably an underestimation because the lack of
sequence from other nematode species may result in an
underestimation of branch lengths [14]. Therefore, the vast
majority of wCNEs are likely to be functional elements under
negative selection.

CNEs share a striking nucleotide signature from C. elegans to vertebrates. The plot shows the percentage of A+T nucleotides for 200 bp of sequence
flanking CNEs (black) and 15 bp of CNE (red) at the CNE border defined by sequence conservation (the sequence on one end of each CNE is reverse
complemented) for (a) F. rubripes, (b) H. sapiens, (c) C. elegans and (d) D. melanogaster. In all four species there is a decrease of A+T content in the 200
bp of sequence flanking the CNEs followed by a sharp A+T increase at the CNE border.

humans indicates that it probably reflects a functional property of CNEs. For example, it might be a sign of a particular
DNA conformation since AA/TT dinucleotides increase DNA
rigidity, potentially making CNEs relatively rigid elements
flanked by flexible DNA, or it may allow DNA unwinding and
base unpairing [22]. The conservation of this signal from
nematodes to humans could be useful for the discovery of
functional non-coding elements less conserved than the
CNEs (T Down, personal communication).

wCNEs are associated with developmental
transcription factors and signaling genes
CNEs in the human genome are associated with genes
involved in the regulation of development and, in particular,

with transcription factors ('trans-dev' genes) [2-4,6,7]. To
assess whether CNEs are associated with certain types of
genes in C. elegans, we spatially associated each wCNE to the
protein-coding gene with the nearest transcription start site.
The mean distance between a wCNE and the nearest transcription start site is 2,929 bp, with 1,206 (82.6%) of intergenic wCNEs lying more than 500 bp from the nearest
transcription start site (Additional data file 3).
In both the human and the C. elegans genome the most significantly enriched functions, according to the Gene Ontology
(GO) terms [26], for CNE-associated genes are related to
transcription factor activity and development (Figure 3). For
example, 2.82% (18/638) of genes associated with wCNEs are

involved in development are associated with CNEs in the
human genome, with a classic example being the sonic hedgehog gene at 7q36.3 [10]. This difference is an intriguing result
considering that the human genome contains more signaling
genes (1,790/15,023 = 11.92% of human genes annotated with
the term 'signal transduction') than the C. elegans genome
(599/8,301 = 7.22%), whereas there are fewer signaling genes
among the human CNE-associated genes (15/274 = 5.47%)
than the wCNE-associated genes in C. elegans (84/638 =
13.17%). A possible explanation for this difference is that signaling genes in vertebrates are associated with elements less
conserved than the CNEs we previously identified. In support
of this hypothesis, a set of vertebrate non-coding elements
identified with less stringent criteria are significantly
enriched for the GO term 'signal transduction' [27].
To further analyze the types of genes associated with CNEs,
we looked at the InterPro protein domains [28] encoded by
these genes. Both Homo sapiens and C. elegans CNEs are
enriched in the neighborhoods of genes encoding DNA-binding transcription factor domains (including Homeodomainlike, Winged-helix repressor DNA-binding, Zinc finger
C2H2-type and HMG1/2; Additional data file 4). We also
examined the enrichment for transcription factors among the
wCNE-associated genes using predicted transcription factors
from two high-quality databases: DBD, a database of computationally predicted transcription factors through homology
to known DNA-binding domains [29]; and wTF2.0, a compendium of computationally and manually curated transcription factors in C. elegans [30]. Out of 1,241 of the wCNEassociated genes, 108 (8.7%) are annotated as transcription
factors according to DBD and 137 out of 1,241 (11.0%) of the
wCNE-associated genes are annotated as transcription factors according to wTF2.0, both being significantly higher than
the proportion in the genome (Additional data file 5).
Both H. sapiens and C. elegans CNEs are also associated with
genes encoding cell-signaling domains, although, as also
noted from the GO terms, this is more pronounced in C. elegans. These domains include those found in extracellular
proteins, cell surface receptors, and intracellular signaling
proteins. The lack of thoroughly annotated sets of signaling
genes could potentially exaggerate differences between
human and worm CNE-associated genes.
Human CNEs are not always found directly adjacent to their
most likely target genes [6,7]. It is also possible that CNEs
may regulate more than one gene, for example, in the case of
bidirectional promoters. Therefore, these statistics probably
underestimate the true association of CNEs with developmental regulatory genes. We conclude that CNEs are associated with genes involved in transcription regulation and
development and, to a certain degree, cell-signaling in both
vertebrates and invertebrates, although the association with
cell signaling genes appears to be stronger in invertebrates.

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/2/R15

Vertebrate and invertebrate CNEs target a common
set of core developmental genes
Most strikingly, we find that many of the genes associated
with CNEs in the C. elegans genome are the direct orthologs
of CNE-associated genes in the human genome. Of 397
human CNE-associated genes, 190 have identifiable
orthologs in C. elegans and, of these, 60 are also associated
with wCNEs in C. elegans. This is much greater than expected
by chance (p < 0.001, by randomization). For example, the C.
elegans gene mab-18 is associated with ten wCNEs and its
human ortholog PAX6 is associated with two hCNEs. For
worm CNE-associated genes that have been duplicated in the
vertebrate lineage, multiple paralogs are often associated
with hCNEs. For example, the C. elegans gene sem-4 is associated with four wCNEs, and has four human orthologs. Of
these, SALL1 is associated with two hCNEs, SALL3 with
eleven hCNEs and SALL4 with one hCNE.
Remarkably, of the 60 human CNE-associated genes that
have C. elegans orthologs that are associated with wCNEs, 40
also have orthologs in Drosophila that are associated with the
conserved elements identified by Glazov et al. [13]. In summary, 40 of 156 human CNE-associated genes that have
orthologs in both C. elegans and D. melanogaster, are also
associated with CNEs in these two species. These genes represent a core set of developmental regulatory genes that are
associated with CNEs across three different animal phyla
(Table 1). Thus, despite the extensive evolutionary distance
and duplication events that have occurred since the divergence of C. elegans, D. melanogaster and H. sapiens, a core
set of orthologous genes are associated with highly conserved
non-coding elements in all three organisms.

wCNEs identify transcriptional enhancer sequences
and may function as transcription factor binding sites
Human CNEs have been proposed to act as cis-elements that
regulate the transcription of developmental genes, and of the
relatively few vertebrate CNEs that have been tested, the
majority can act as tissue-specific enhancers when coinjected with a reporter gene in zebrafish or in transgenic
mice [4,7-10]. Therefore, we reasoned that, if worm CNEs
also function as enhancers, then they should overlap multiple
previously characterized enhancer sequences in the worm
genome. By using literature searches, we compiled a list of 17
C. elegans genes with extensively dissected cis-regulatory
sequences. We found that six of these genes are associated
with wCNEs, and that, in five of these six cases, the wCNEs
are contained within the defined enhancer regions (Additional data file 6). For example, the gene ser-2 is associated
with five wCNEs, and each of these wCNEs lies within a
genomic region that acts as a transcriptional enhancer for a
different tissue or cell type (Figure 4). This provides good evidence that CNEs can act as transcriptional enhancers in vivo.
The simplest hypothesis for how CNEs function is that they
encode arrays of transcription factor binding sites. If this

CNEs identify previously characterized enhancer sequences and when located in introns are associated with alternative transcriptional start sites. Five
wCNEs are contained within four elements that regulate ser-2, the C. elegans ortholog of human serotonin receptor 1A. The products of ser-2 were
identified as components of the AIY interneuron gene battery in C. elegans [60]. ser-2 has at least three alternative transcription start sites that produce a
number of different gene products, considered to be expressed in different but overlapping regions [61]. Remarkably, each of the alternative transcription
start sites is marked by a wCNE in the proximal upstream region, with additional wCNEs lying further away, highlighting the underlying cis-regulatory
elements. The upstream sequences of each of the alternative transcription start sites were defined by deletion analysis [61]. One of the wCNEs lies within
an approximately 280 bp element driving expression in the AIY and SIA neuronal cellular subtypes. A second wCNE lies within an approximately 520 bp
element driving expression in the RME neurons and also, consistently, in other unidentified neurons. A third wCNE lies within an approximately 1,150 bp
element driving expression in the head muscles. Two more wCNEs are contained within a region driving expression in PVD and lateral OLL neurons. Only
the experimentally tested constructs that overlap wCNEs are shown in this diagram.

were the case, then CNEs associated with genes known to be
expressed in a particular tissue type should be enriched for
DNA binding sites for transcription factors regulating the coexpression of these genes in that tissue. To test this hypothesis, we used DNA microarray data [31] to identify 54
wCNE-associated genes that are expressed in the C. elegans
pharynx. These genes are associated with a total of 120
wCNEs (from here on referred to as 'pharyngeal wCNEs').
Our set of pharyngeal wCNEs contains 40 intronic and 80
intergenic wCNEs, ranging in size from 31 bp to 216 bp (mean
= 68.2 bp; median = 60 bp). It is important to note that many
of the intergenic wCNEs in this set lie further than the classical 'promoter region' (often described as the first 500 bp to
1,000 bp upstream of a gene), with pharyngeal wCNEs ranging from 27 bp to 9,577 bp (mean = 2,970 bp; median = 2,053
bp) from the associated pharyngeal gene. To identify putative
transcription factor binding sites in the pharyngeal wCNEs,
we searched for overrepresented sequence motifs using the
Weeder motif discovery algorithm, which searches for overrepresented motifs and then carries out a post-processing
step to identify similar ('redundant') motifs among the highest scoring motifs [32]. Weeder identified a single redundant
motif that is significantly enriched in these sequences (p <
0.002). Strikingly, this motif (Figure 5) is very similar to the

consensus binding site of the pharyngeal transcription factor
PHA-4. PHA-4 is the major specifier of pharyngeal cell identity in C. elegans [33,34], suggesting that occurrences of this
motif in wCNEs represent genuine PHA-4 binding sites.
Indeed, inspection of the seven highest scoring occurrences of
the motif in the pharyngeal CNEs (Table 2) revealed that one
of the predicted sites lies 1.2 kb upstream of the gene ceh-22,
within a 30 bp pharyngeal muscle enhancer previously shown
to be bound by PHA-4 [35] (annotated in WormBase as two
overlapping PHA-4 binding sites with WormBase identifiers
WBsf019089 and WBsf019090). Therefore, by searching for
overrepresented motifs in a set of wCNEs associated with
genes expressed in the pharynx, we were able to identify the
binding site for the transcription factor that acts as the major
specifier of pharyngeal cell identity. Taken together with the
identification of other wCNEs within previously characterized enhancers, this suggests that wCNEs represent enhancer
sequences that function (at least partially) by encoding transcription factor binding sites.

Intronic wCNEs likely function as enhancers for
downstream alternative transcription start sites
Almost a third of wCNEs (624/2,084) are located in introns.

We have identified a set of highly conserved non-coding
sequences (wCNEs) in the genome of C. elegans. Just as with
CNEs in the human genome, these wCNEs are clustered
around genes that encode regulators of development, especially transcription factors and signaling genes. Both human
and worm CNEs share striking nucleotide frequency patterns
at their boundaries and are similarly AT-rich, despite differences in the background A+T content of their genomes.
Worm CNEs overlap many independently identified cis-regulatory elements, and vertebrate CNEs can act as tissue-specific enhancers in transient zebrafish assays. It seems likely,
therefore, that human and worm CNEs function analogously
as cis-elements that regulate the transcription of a core set of
developmental regulatory genes. Consistent with this model,
intronic wCNEs are very strongly associated with downstream alternative transcriptional start sites, suggesting that
they too probably function as tissue-specific cis-regulatory
elements.

Worm CNEs are enriched for transcription factor binding sites
Worm CNEs are enriched for transcription factor binding sites. Sequence
logo representation of the motif significantly overrepresented in wCNEs
associated with pharyngeal genes, according to the Weeder motif
discovery algorithm [32]. The first six bases of this motif (with consensus
TGTTTGGCAACT) agree with the first six bases of the consensus binding
site of the PHA-4 transcription factor (TRTTKRY, where R = A/G, K = T/
G, and Y = T/C) [33, 34]. Note that the seventh position of the predicted
motif has low information content, indicating that sites with differences in
this position are still likely to represent variants of the same transcription
factor binding site.

How do CNEs regulate gene-expression? The simplest model
is that CNEs encode transcription factor binding sites. In support of this model, we find that wCNEs associated with genes
expressed in the pharynx are significantly enriched for a DNA
motif that matches the binding-site of the major pharynx
specifying transcription factor PHA-4. However, it is still difficult to reconcile the length and level of sequence conservation of CNEs with the known sequence constraints of
transcription factor binding sites, especially since conservation of individual transcription factor binding sites has been
found unnecessary for conservation of enhancer function (for
example, [36]). Therefore, CNEs may represent very dense,

type of element, we examined whether they are associated
with particular classes of transcripts. We found that there is a
strong association between the presence of an intronic wCNE
and genes that are known to produce multiple different transcripts (57% of genes containing intronic wCNEs have documented alternative transcripts, compared to 19% of all multiexon genes). Moreover, in 70% of the cases of alternatively
spliced genes containing intronic wCNEs, the gene encodes
an alternative first exon (compared to 35% of all genes with
alternative transcripts). This suggests that intronic wCNEs
are strongly associated with genes with alternative first exons
and, therefore, that intronic wCNEs may act as enhancers for
downstream alternative start sites. In support of this
hypothesis, in 78% of cases the intronic wCNE is located
upstream of the alternative first exon (see Figure 4 for examples). Therefore, we do not believe that, in general, intronic
wCNEs regulate alternative splicing. Rather, we suggest that,
at least in C. elegans, the majority of intronic wCNEs, like
intergenic wCNEs, probably function as cis-regulatory tran-

reports

We used the Weeder motif discovery program to search for overrepresented motifs in all wCNEs spatially associated with genes predicted to be
expressed in the pharynx based on microarray data [31]. From this dataset, Weeder identified a motif very similar to the consensus binding site for
PHA-4, the master specifier of pharyngeal cell identity (TRTTKRY, where R = A/G, K = T/G, and Y = T/C) [33, 34]. This table shows the
coordinates (WormBase version WS140) of the wCNEs that contain matches to the overrepresented motif, the coordinates of the matches within
the wCNEs, the Weeder scores of the matches to the motif, the distances (in bp) between the wCNEs and the transcription start site (TSS) of the
associated genes and the names of the associated genes. The predicted site in the element 1.2 kb upstream of ceh-22 (marked with an asterisk) lies
within a 30 bp pharyngeal muscle enhancer bound by PHA-4 [35].

potentially overlapping transcription factor binding sites. If
this scenario were true, differences in the number of
overlapping constraints between different cis-elements
would manifest as differences in the degree of sequence conservation of these elements, with CNEs representing the most
extreme cases. Indeed, reducing the stringency of the conservation threshold (either by relaxing the similarity search criteria [4,27] or by comparing less divergent species [37]) often
reveals additional or longer non-coding elements. Alternatively, CNEs may also encode some additional regulatory
function. For example, it is possible to envisage mechanisms
involving sequence recognition between homologous
chromosomes (for example, 'transvection' [38]) that would
require sequence identity to be maintained between the
maternal and paternal genomes.
Remarkably, of the 190 genes that are associated with CNEs
in humans and have orthologs in C. elegans, 60 have
orthologs that are also associated with CNEs in C. elegans.
This suggests that unrelated CNEs may be associated with a
core set of regulatory genes in many divergent animal species.
In support of this, 40 of these 60 genes are also orthologous
to CNE-associated genes in D. melanogaster. Such an overlap
between the sets of CNE-associated genes from three animal
phyla is very unlikely to have arisen by chance, and suggests
that a core set of developmental regulatory genes may be
associated with CNEs across all animal lineages.
Because of its genetic tractability and reduced intergenic distances, we propose that C. elegans will serve as an excellent
model organism for further understanding the mechanism by
which CNEs regulate gene expression. The dissection of CNEs
in parallel in different animals using both computational and
experimental approaches would provide us with valuable
insight into the evolution of the regulatory networks that control the development of the metazoan body plan.
Since many of the genes associated with CNEs encode for
transcription factors that control early development, it is possible that CNEs themselves are bound by these transcription
factors. Orthologous transcription factors are not only
present in most metazoan lineages, but also often have highly
conserved DNA-binding domains (for example, the DNAbinding domains of orthologous HOX [39], FOXA [33,34]
and Brachyury T-box [40] proteins). It is tempting, therefore,
to speculate that CNEs might function as enhancers even
when tested in different animal lineages. A small number of
reporter gene assays testing enhancers of regulatory genes
from vertebrates in flies have shown positive results (for
example, [41-43]), indicating that the regulators of these vertebrate enhancers are also present in flies. However, we
would not expect alternative CNEs from different animals to
drive the same expression patterns, reflecting differences in
the body plans of different animal lineages.

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/2/R15

CNEs and the evolution of animal body plans
The evolution of cis-regulatory elements is an important driving force in the evolution of gene regulatory networks
(GRNs). In the case of multicellular animals, the initial
assembly and subsequent modifications of cis-elements for
key developmental control genes probably allowed the 'rewiring' of developmental GRNs and, hence, the evolution of
new animal body plans [44]. In this way, regulatory genes
became associated with alternative sets of cis-elements in different animal lineages and these cis-elements now define the
core GRNs of each animal body plan. We propose that CNEs
represent the 'hard-wired' sequence traces of these core animal group-specific GRNs. The alternative core GRNs of different animal lineages are reflected in their having alternative
CNEs. However, because of their co-evolution from a common metazoan ancestor, the core GRNs of different animal
groups often utilize the same regulatory genes. As a result,
distinct yet parallel sets of CNEs have become irreversibly
associated with the same genes that coordinate core developmental networks in diverse animal groups. Indeed, this
evolution of regulatory elements may underlie the astounding
diversification of animal body plans that was seen during the
Cambrian period approximately 550 million years ago.

Materials and methods
Identification of conserved non-coding elements in C.
elegans
DNA sequences and annotation files for the C. elegans
genome (release WS140), the DNA sequence for the C.
briggsae genome (release cb25) and the repeat-masked
sequence of the C. remanei genome (downloaded on 30
October 2005) were retrieved from WormBase [45]. The
sequence of each C. elegans chromosome was split into 500
kb fragments overlapping by 200 bp. We searched for local
similarity between each 500 kb sequence fragment from C.
elegans against the genome of C. briggsae using MegaBlast
(version 2.2.6) [46]. We performed MegaBlast searches with
soft masking, e-value threshold of 0.001 and word seed size
100 bp (W100), 75 bp (W75), 50 bp (W50), 40 bp (W40) and
30 bp (W30). Where overlapping regions of the query (C. elegans) sequence matched more than one location in the C.
briggsae genome, these regions of the query were merged,
resulting in non-overlapping elements. Conserved elements
were annotated according to the set of WormBase features
provided in Additional data file 7. Elements not overlapping
any of these features were marked as 'unannotated' elements
and elements within introns of protein-coding genes were
only annotated as 'intronic' if they did not overlap any type of
exons or repeats (Additional data file 7). Our definition of
unannotated and intronic conserved elements is very conservative, so that any amount of overlap between a conserved
element and a genomic feature, such as any type of exon, a
match to an expressed sequence, a predicted gene, or a repeat
is considered sufficient to mask this element as exonic or
repetitive. Unannotated and intronic elements were further

Therefore, the enrichment of wCNEs on chromosome X is
highly significant (p value < 0.001).

For each of the 2,084 wCNEs, we identified the protein-coding genes with the nearest transcription start site (TSS)
according to the WormBase annotation (WS140; Additional
data file 9). We assigned 1,241 genes to the wCNEs. As fly
CNEs we used the 20,301 intergenic and intronic 'ultraconserved' (uc) elements between D. melanogaster and D.
pseudoobscura with size ≥50 bp from Glazov et al. [13]. We
associated each uc-element to the gene with the nearest transcription start site (according to the fly genome annotation
release dm1). We assigned 3,750 genes to fly uc-elements.
Similarly, we identified the nearest protein-coding genes to
the 1,373 human elements conserved between human and
Fugu from Woolfe et al. [4] according to human genome
NCBI35 accessed via Ensembl [53] v35 (397 genes) (Additional data file 10).

information

The GO annotation files for C. elegans (revision 1.55) and
human (revision 1.22) were downloaded directly from the GO
website [26]. Only GO terms inferred automatically (GO evidence code IEA) were used in our analysis because of the
heavy bias of RNAi phenotypes on the GO annotations of the
genes in C. elegans (our unpublished observation). To
increase the signal, GO terms were converted to the higherlevel GOslim terms and these are the terms we have used in
this paper. GOslim term associations and counts for C. elegans and human genes were calculated using the Perl script
map2slim from the go-perl package and the generic GOslim
(revision 1.116) [54]. Out of 397 human genes and 1,241 C. elegans genes, 274 and 638, respectively, were assigned a GOslim term. We retrieved protein domains for the C. elegans and
the human genes from Ensembl. Out of 397 human genes and
1,241 C. elegans genes spatially associated with CNEs, 316
and 877, respectively, were annotated with at least one InterPro domain. To increase the signal, each domain was converted to the top-level parent domain according to the
InterPro protein domain annotation using a custom Perl
script. The following analysis was carried out for all top-level
InterPro domains found in at least ten genes in the human
and the C. elegans genomes. For each type of annotation (i.e.
each GOsilm term and each InterPro parent domain), we calculated the log odds ratio log((a × b)/(c × d)) , where a is the
number of genes in the CNE-associated gene set with the spe-

The clustering of wCNEs along the C. elegans chromosome
and the comparison of the distances between CNEs in the
human and the C. elegans genome were calculated as
described in Woolfe et al. [4]. We assessed the enrichment of
wCNEs on chromosome X using a randomization test. We
generated 1,000 sets of 2,084 (that is, the same number as the
wCNEs) random locations in the C. elegans genome, making
sure that the random locations lie within non-coding and
non-repetitive regions. The random sets had, on average,
487.3 wCNEs on X (minimum = 432; maximum = 550).

The A+T nucleotide content in the 200 bp flanking CNEs and
the first 15 bp of CNEs were calculated according to Walter et

We also calculated the overlap between wCNEs and elements
predicted as conserved using PhastCons. PhastCons [14] is a
statistical method that scores sequences in alignments
according to how much more likely it is that they are conserved than that they are evolving neutrally, based on a phylogenetic hidden Markov model. Elements predicted to be

scanned for missed repeats using RepeatMasker (version
3.0.8, slow/sensitive option, using Crossmatch) [47] using
both the C. elegans repeat library distributed with the program and the C. briggsae library downloaded from WormBase [18]. The remaining elements were scanned for missed
tRNAs using tRNAscan-SE (v.1.11) [48]. In addition, 36 elements with a BLAST match in Rfam [49], the microRNA registry database [50] and EMBL expressed sequence tags
(downloaded on 21 April 2005) were removed (e-value
threshold of 0.0001). We then checked whether the remaining unannotated or intronic conserved elements found in C.
elegans and C. briggsae were similarly conserved in the
genome of C. remanei using MegaBlast, with soft masking,
word seed length of 30 bp and e-value threshold 0.0001. Of
the elements conserved between C. elegans and C. briggsae,
69% were also found in C. remanei using the same similarity
search criteria. The sequences of the final set of 2,084 wCNEs
are provided in Additional data file 8. Finally, we searched the
set of 2,084 wCNEs for sequence similarity against the
human CNEs (1,373 sequences from Woolfe et al. [4]) using
BlastN (version 2.2.6) [51] and found no significant hits (evalue threshold = 0.0001).
We compared the final set of elements conserved between all
three Caenorhabditis species with elements identified as conserved by WABA, a sensitive alignment method designed to
find homologous regions between the C. elegans and the C.
briggsae genome and annotate them as 'strongly conserved',
'weakly conserved' or 'coding' using information on conservation and the third base 'wobble' of protein-coding sequences
[12]. Of all base pairs in wCNEs, 97% are contained within
alignments classified as strongly conserved, 0.6% are within
alignments classified as coding and 6% are within alignments
classified as weakly conserved.

randomization test to check how likely it is to get by chance
the same proportion of genes annotated with the GO terms
'transcription factor activity' and 'development' as we did for
the wCNE set. To do this, we generated 1,000 sets of 2,084
(that is, the same number as the wCNEs) random locations in
the C. elegans genome, making sure that the random locations lie within non-coding and non-repetitive regions. For
each random location, we then retrieved the gene with the
nearest transcription start site. Finally, for each set, we
counted the proportion of genes annotated with the GO terms
'transcription factor activity' and 'development'.
Orthologous gene clusters were retrieved from Inparanoid
(version 4.0) [57]. The Inparanoid dataset contains clusters of
orthologous proteins between pairs of genomes. There are
4,558 Inparanoid clusters of orthologous proteins from C.
elegans and human that contain 8,846 human proteins and
5,614 C. elegans proteins. Of the human protein-coding genes
with C. elegans orthologs and the C. elegans protein-coding
genes with human orthologs, 190 and 424, respectively, are
associated with CNEs. For D. melanogaster and H. sapiens,
there are 5,497 Inparanoid clusters of orthologs that contain
8,960 human proteins and 6,170 D. melanogaster proteins.
Of the human protein-coding genes with D. melanogaster
orthologs and the D. melanogaster protein-coding genes with
human orthologs, 215 and 1,254, respectively, are associated
with CNEs/uc-elements. To evaluate the significance of the
overlap between CNE-associated genes in human and C. elegans, we performed 1,000 randomizations, randomly picking
424 C. elegans genes from those in the Inparanoid clusters
and counting how many of them have an ortholog among the
190 human CNE-associated genes. The same overlap of CNEassociated genes in the two genomes was never seen in 1,000
randomizations. Similarly, we performed 1,000 randomizations, randomly picking 1,254 D. melanogaster genes and
counting how many of them have an ortholog among the 215
human CNE-associated genes. Again, the same overlap of
CNE-associated genes in the two genomes was never seen in
1,000 randomizations.

Motif discovery in pharyngeal gene-associated CNEs
Genes expressed in the pharynx were identified by microarray
analysis in [31]. The 120 wCNEs associated with pharyngeal
genes were submitted to a local installation of Weeder (version 1.3) [32]. We performed an 'extra' mode search (that is,
