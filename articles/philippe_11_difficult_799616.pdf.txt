Difficult phylogenetic questions: more data,
maybe; better methods, certainly

Abstract
Contradicting the prejudice that endosymbiosis is a
rare phenomenon, Husník and co-workers show in
BMC Biology that bacterial endosymbiosis has occured
several times independently during insect evolution.
Rigorous phylogenetic analyses, in particular using
complex models of sequence evolution and an original
site removal procedure, allow this conclusion to be
established after eschewing inference artefacts that
usually plague the positioning of highly divergent
endosymbiont genomic sequences.
Commentary
Modern Western civilisation has promoted individualism,
individual autonomy and self-determination to such a
high level that it has even permeated biological thought.
For instance, based on the idea that individuals can and
should thrive on their own, it is commonly accepted that
endosymbiosis – an organism living non-autonomously
inside another organism – is extremely difficult and has
arisen very rarely throughout evolution. However, it is a
Western prejudice that any organism, including humans,
can thrive autonomously. This prejudice is contradicted
by the data. For instance, a mere few percent of micro­
organisms are able to grow in pure culture. Obviously, an
organism spends all its lifetime in close contact and
interaction with many other organisms, so that a pure
culture is likely to be an extremely hostile environment.
In the era of metagenomics it is now common knowledge
that in a human body, bacterial cells not only outnumber
human cells but also provide numerous essential services.
Accordingly, organisms have been selected to live in
commensal or symbiotic relationships with one or several
other species (this does not mean universal harmony;
such interactions often evolve into parasitism).

Endo­ ymbiosis is simply a further twist of a very common
s
phenomenon. Given that the prejudice inspired by
individual­ sm is erroneous, the recent demonstration
i
that endosymbioses are more frequent than previously
thought ought not to be but apparently is surprising [1].
This surprise reflects, however, our anthropocentrism
rather than a basic conflict of our conception of biological
relationships. A study published in BMC Biology [2] adds
new evidence to support this by demonstrating that at
least four independent endosymbioses of an entero­
bacterium within an insect have occurred.

Systematic errors in endosymbiont phylogenies
Husník and co-workers [2] address the question of the
evolution of endosymbiosis in insects by applying a
phylogenomic approach – the use of complete genomes
to infer phylogenetic relationships. A naïve opinion is
that phylogenomics will end incongruence in phylogeny,
and therefore that gathering more data will suffice to
resolve outstanding phylogenetic questions. However,
while the use of many genes does reduce stochastic errors
(due to improved sample size), it simultaneously makes
systematic errors more apparent [3]. Systematic errors
are due to the limitations of tree inference methods,
which do not sufficiently account for the complexity of
the genomic data. As such, systematic errors will lead to
more and more biased results as the amount of data
increases, thus producing highly supported, yet erro­
neous, phylogenomic trees.
Preventing systematic errors is therefore the most
important issue in phylogenomics. The principal cause of
reconstruction artefacts is the difficulty of detection of
multiple nucleotide substitutions occurring at a given site
by inference methods. Three complementary approaches
have been developed to reduce the impact of systematic
errors (reviewed in [3]):
1)	the use of a large number of species, naturally easing
the detection of multiple substitutions,
2)	the use of complex models of sequence evolution
(especially by accounting for heterogeneity across sites

and over time), allowing more accurate detection of
multiple substitutions,
3)	the removal of the fastest evolving sites, which are
obviously the most prone to exhibit multiple
substitutions.
Inferring the origin of endosymbionts is typically
difficult for phylogenomics. Their intracellular lifestyle
introduces similar biases in independent endosymbiotic
organisms, with such convergences leading to potentially
erroneous grouping of unrelated species. More precisely,
because of their small effective population size, endo­
symbionts are subject to an irreversible accumulation of
deleterious mutations, known as Muller’s ratchet, thereby
evolving at an accelerated rate. These accelerations may
lead to the well-known long branch attraction artefact, in
which the longest branches of a phylogenetic tree are
clustered together irrespective of their true relationships.
Moreover, due to this inefficient purifying selection,
endosymbionts are more sensitive to mutational bias,
with their genomes becoming more A+T rich. The
erroneous grouping of species with similar nucleotide
composition is also a frequent artefact (e.g. [4]).
Husník et al. [2] took many precautions to reduce the
effect of these two biases that favour, potentially
erroneously, the clustering of endosymbionts. First, they
selected all the genes that are single copy in the 50
complete genome sequences of γ-Proteobacteria, hence
avoiding identification problems caused by multi-copy
gene families. Second, they used as many enterobacterial
species as are currently available, although they could
have used more outgroup species. These trivial, some­
times neglected, steps lead to a large dataset of 69 genes
(63,462 nucleotidic sites, or 21,154 amino acid sites). Not
surprisingly, a naïve phylogeny based on nucleotides and
assuming compositional homogeneity over time leads to
the grouping of the fast evolving, A+T-rich, endo­
symbionts (named hereafter the FEAT group), with high
statistical support. Although this topology is certainly
partly incorrect (for example, the inclusion of two species
with the highest AT content, Riesia and Wigglesworthia,
within the genus Buchnera), the monophyly of most
endosymbionts might be correct, since it is possible for a
bias to reinforce a true (but unknown) phylogenetic
signal.

Handling the complexity of evolutionary processes
is of prime importance
Given the impossibility of experimental validation in
what is fundamentally an historical science, corrobora­
tion is the most efficient support of an inference [5]. In
general, phylogenomicists look for congruence among
independent sets of characters (for example, between
primary sequences and gene content, gene order or
intron positions). Alternatively, as done by Husník et al.

Page 2 of 4

[2], congruence on the same dataset among independent
methods is also relevant, especially in the case of bacterial
endosymbionts, for which other character types are nonexistent or inadequate; for instance gene content is highly
prone to convergence. Husník and colleagues [2] hence
applied a variety of methods known to reduce artefacts
due to compositional bias and/or long branch attraction.
Importantly, the more accurate the method is, the fewer
endosymbionts are grouped, which strongly argues for
several independent endosymbioses.
The use of amino acid sequences is an effective way to
reduce the misleading effect of nucleotide compositional
heterogeneity, although some information is lost. The use
of a standard site-homogeneous model leads to the
exclusion of Regiella from the FEAT group, while the
CAT+GTR model [6] that simultaneously handles
hetero­ eneity in the evolutionary process across sites and
g
among amino acid substitutions leads to the further
exclusion of Ishikawaella. Since the CAT+GTR model
fits the data better and is less sensitive to long branch
attraction [7], this first result is in agreement with an
artefactual nature of the FEAT group. As nucleotide
heterogeneity may affect amino acid composition, Husník
et al. [2] applied the Dayhoff recoding. This is a recoding
of amino acids into the six main Dayhoff categories, such
as grouping the positive amino acids arginine, histidine
and lysine, and is known to reduce possible biases [8],
again at the cost of information. Interestingly, in the
resulting phylogeny, the insect endosymbionts explode
into four monophyletic groups dispersed over the entero­
bacterial tree. The disaggregation of the FEAT group is
similarly observed for the analysis of nucleotidic sequences
after removal of third codon positions or RY-coding
(purine/pyrimidine), and the use of an improved model
of sequence evolution. In particular, the use of a nonhomogeneous model [9], that is, a model that does not
assume homogeneity of nucleotide composition over
time, recovers a topology that is highly similar to the
Dayhoff-recoded topology.
To validate this result further, Husník and colleagues
[2] applied another approach, the removal of sites.
Unexpectedly, the classical removal of the fast evolving
sites has little effect, leading simply to the exclusion of
Riesa from the FEAT group. Indeed, under models
accounting for the rate heterogeneity across sites, the
likelihoods of a site requiring 20 substitutions on the
incorrect topology and 22 substitutions on the correct
topology are very similar for both topologies. Therefore
the removal of the fastest evolving sites is expected to
have limited benefit, even if these sites have more rapidly
accumulated a deleterious compositional heterogeneity.
Husník et al. [2] reasoned that, because of the high level
of compositional heterogeneity, the most problematic
sites might not be the fastest evolving sites, but the most

Figure 1. Two different strategies of site removal to reduce systematic error. Because the G+C content is heterogeneous across species, taxa E
and F are erroneously recovered as a sister-group of taxon J in the phylogeny based on a phylogenomic dataset due to convergently acquired high
G+C content. The standard approach consisting of removing the fastest evolving sites does not alleviate this artefact. The second strategy proposed
by Husník et al. [2] consists of removing the positions that contain both A/T and G/C nucleotides, and thus are more likely to be compositionally
biased. The method is more effective in recovering the correct topology (right side of the figure) when compositional bias is the main cause of
systematic error.

compositionally biased. Accordingly, they decided to
focus on sites that contain only adenine and thymine or
guanine and cytosine, in other words, sites with a homo­
geneous A+T content. When they increasingly remove
sites containing a large amount of both A/T and G/C,
until only homogeneous sites remain (Figure  1), the
FEAT group progressively disappears, in a very similar
way to the result obtained with the model improvement
discussed above. The reason is that a slowly evolving site
with a non-homogeneous nucleotide composition can
seriously bias phylogenetic inference: the likelihood of a
site requiring 1 substitution on the incorrect topology
and two substitutions on the correct topology is sensibly
lower in the first case.
We recently obtained a similar result in the case of an
animal phylogeny based on the mitochondrial genome.
The removal of fast evolving sites has no effect, whereas
the removal of heteropecillous sites, ones that change
their substitution pattern over time, leads to the correct
topology [10]. These two failures of fast site removal can
be easily explained. Models of sequence evolution handle
rate heterogeneity across sites anyway, usually through a
gamma distribution, so that fast evolving sites will be
detected, and have a limited effect on topology inference.
In contrast, a site that violates model assumptions such
as non-homogeneity of nucleotide composition across

species might still evolve slowly and seriously impact
phylogenetic reconstruction. The study of Husník et al.
[2] and our work [10] argue in favour of developing
methods that specifically remove model-violating sites
rather than fast evolving sites.
Corroboration is key to solving difficult phylogenetic
questions. Instead of using independent markers (for
instance, from mitochondrion, plastid and nucleus),
Husník et al. [2] successfully used three independent
approaches to demonstrate that at least four endo­
symbioses of Enterobacteria have occurred in the insect
lineage. More generally, this study demonstrates that, in
spite of overwhelming genomic data, more effort should
be put into refining data analysis. Unfortunately, the two
approaches that are the most beneficial to phylogenetic
accuracy - more species and better models - both imply a
drastic increase in computation time. In a time of global
warming and biodiversity loss, it is also urgent that
scientists strive to decrease the environmental footprint
of their research activities. Individualism is one cause of
current environmental problems. An increase in our
knowledge about the commonness of the symbiosis and
its evolutionary advantages (by low consuming experi­
ments) could be a way to change our societal paradigms
and solve environmental crisis. The evolutionary advan­
tages of endosymbioses should not be ignored.
