Abstract
Background: The Mannheimia species encompass a wide variety of bacterial lifestyles, including
opportunistic pathogens and commensals of the ruminant respiratory tract, commensals of the
ovine rumen, and pathogens of the ruminant integument. Here we present a scenario for the
evolution of the leukotoxin promoter among representatives of the five species within genus
Mannheimia. We also consider how the evolution of the leukotoxin operon fits with the evolution
and maintenance of virulence.
Results: The alignment of the intergenic regions upstream of the leukotoxin genes showed
significant sequence and positional conservation over a 225-bp stretch immediately proximal to the
transcriptional start site of the lktC gene among all Mannheimia strains. However, in the course of
the Mannheimia genome evolution, the acquisition of individual noncoding regions upstream of the
conserved promoter region has occurred. The rate of evolution estimated branch by branch
suggests that the conserved promoter may be affected to different extents by the types of natural
selection that potentially operate in regulatory regions. Tandem repeats upstream of the core
promoter were confined to M. haemolytica with a strong association between the sequence of the
repeat units, the number of repeat units per promoter, and the phylogenetic history of this species.
Conclusion: The mode of evolution of the intergenic regions upstream of the leukotoxin genes
appears to be highly dependent on the lifestyle of the bacterium. Transition from avirulence to
virulence has occurred at least once in M. haemolytica with some evolutionary success of bovine
serotype A1/A6 strains. Our analysis suggests that changes in cis-regulatory systems have
contributed to the derived virulence phenotype by allowing phase-variable expression of the
leukotoxin protein. We propose models for how phase shifting and the associated virulence could
facilitate transmission to the nasopharynx of new hosts.

Background
The genus Mannheimia includes strains previously classified as trehalose-negative [Pasteurella] haemolytica and is
one of the most well-defined and robust clusters within
the gamma-proteobacterial family of Pasteurellaceae Pohl
1981 [1]. The Mannheimia species have taken divergent
paths toward their distinct lifestyles. The majority of
strains isolated from pulmonary infection in cattle
belongs to M. haemolytica serotype A1/A6 [2]. These
strains are sub-dominant to other serotypes (e.g., bovine
serotype A2 strains) in the nasopharynx of healthy cattle
but dominate when the host defences are at least partly
compromised [3-5]. In the immunocompromised host,
they have an increased capacity for proliferation and can
achieve relatively high total numbers in the nasopharynx,
where they are likely to be transmitted to the nasopharynx
of new hosts or to spill over or otherwise enter the lungs
[6]. However, pulmonary infection caused by M. haemolytica serotype A1 is considered to be non-communicable
(i.e. no direct transmission between the lungs) and the
continuous circulation of these bacteria in bovine populations seems to depend on their capacity for asymptomatic
transmission to the nasopharynx, and not the lungs, of
new hosts [7]. By contrast, bovine serotype A2 strains of
M. haemolytica have had a long history in bovine populations, where they colonise the nasopharynx asymptomatically and rarely cause disease [2]. Also strains of M.
glucosida serotype A11 and M. ruminalis, the sister group to
M. haemolytica + M. glucosida, appear to be adapted to a
relatively benign lifestyle in the ovine nasopharynx and
rumen, respectively [1,2]. In addition, bovine strains of
M. varigena biogroup 6, which is the most basal of the
Mannheimia species, colonise the nasopharynx asymptomatically, although they have the propensity to cause disease [1]. It therefore seems reasonable to conclude that
the genes responsible for the virulence of Mannheimia
strains must evolve in response to the demands (selection
pressures) associated with a commensal lifestyle rather
than any advantages that might arise from causing disease.
Previous works have revealed that the leukotoxin (LktA)
protein produced by M. haemolytica serotype A1 provides
protection from the circulating constitutive and inducible
immune defences during pulmonary infection via interactions with host cells [8-10]. Interestingly, much of the virulence can be blamed on the seemingly misguided
overresponse of the immune defences [11]. The LktA protein induces the overwhelming activation of neutrophils
leading to production of cytokines that mediate tissue
injury [12-15].
The leukotoxin (lkt) operon codes for four proteins: an
internal acyltransferase, encoded by lktC [16]; the structural toxin, encoded by lktA, which belongs to the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/121

Escherichia coli HlyA-like subfamily of cytotoxic RTX
(repeats in toxin) proteins [16]; an inner membrane protein with a cytoplasmic ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
domain, encoded by lktB, which pumps out the LktA protein via interaction with the C terminus of the LktA protein [17]; and a membrane fusion protein, encoded by
lktD, which forms a bridge between the inner and outer
membranes [17]. The genes for these four proteins are
physically adjacent on the chromosome and are transcribed as lktCA or lktCABD messages [18,19].
Recent reports provided the first support for the view that
the lkt operon was vertically inherited from the last common ancestor of genus Mannheimia to any ancestor of the
diverging species, while changes such as chromosomal
rearrangements, pseudogene formation, and deletions of
various sizes have occurred in the region upstream of the
lkt genes in individual subclades/species [20,21]. However, the extent to which these molecular evolutionary
forces affect lkt gene regulation is not known.
In this article, we analysed the lkt promoter among representatives of the five Mannheimia species in order to identify changes in cis-regulatory systems that could have
catalysed adaptive evolution. We started our study using
multiple sequence alignment as a tool for the identification of orthologous sequences in the intergenic region
upstream of the lkt genes (called hereafter the conserved
promoter, CP). We also surveyed existing data on regulatory sequences in order to delineate the spatial and functional boundaries of the CP region. On the basis of the
multiple sequence alignment, we estimated the rate of
evolution for each CP sequence in order to infer the selective constraints. We finally consider how the evolution of
the lkt operon fits with the evolution and maintenance of
virulence.

Results and discussion
Table 1 presents the Mannheimia strains analysed in this
study, sorted by their overall similarity to M. haemolytica
serotype A1 str. PHL213. This measure of similarity is
based on 16S rRNA phylogenies [1,20] and on relationships resolved by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis
(MLEE) typing within M. haemolytica + M. glucosida [2].
Conservation and flexibility in the intergenic region
upstream of the lkt genes
The alignment revealed 100% identity over the entire 406bp intergenic region from M. haemolytica serotype A1 str.
PHL101 and str. PHL213 (data not shown) and previous
reports [18,22,23] allowed us to infer cis-regulatory
sequences. The 406-bp region was shared among M.
haemolytica serotype A2 and M. glucosida serotype A11 as
reflected in Figure 1. The alignment showed significant
sequence and positional conservation over a 225-bp

stretch immediately proximal to the transcriptional start
site of the lktC gene among all Mannheimia strains (CP
region), with the notable exception of the region corresponding to the repeat tract in M. haemolytica serotype A1
[22], which accommodated many sequence variations
(Figures 1 and 2).
In M. haemolytica + M. glucosida, the distal 180-bp stretch
of sequence was juxtaposed to the transcriptional start site
of the artJ gene (Figure 1). No homology was detected
between this 180-bp stretch and the noncoding regions
upstream of the CP region in the remaining Mannheimia
species (data not shown).
In order to gain some insight into the possible evolutionary mechanisms of this differential pattern, we performed
for each species analysis of sequence and positional conservation in the noncoding region upstream of the CP
region. In M. ruminalis and M. varigena, these regions contained stretches of sequence unique to the lapB genes
(data not shown). The region of M. granulomatis was adjacent to the xylB pseudogene and contained a fragment of
about 620 bp corresponding to the distal region of the
parental xylB gene as described elsewhere [21]. Moreover,
this region contained a 50-bp stretch of inverted sequence
that was homologous to the hslV-hslU intergenic regions
and stretches of sequence unique to the lapB genes (data
not shown).
These observations provide support for the view that the
artJ operon, including 180-bp of sequence upstream of
the transcribed artJ gene, was translocated into the intergenic region upstream of the lkt genes during early evolu-

tion of M. haemolytica + M. glucosida and that the hslVU
and lapB operons has undergone pseudogene formation
and deletions in M. granulomatis after divergence from the
remaining Mannheimia species [21].
These observations illustrate how a few evolutionary
events in closely related strains can alter dramatically an
intergenic region. In the case of M. haemolytica + M. glucosida, the alteration coincided with an evolutionary success.
Interestingly, transcriptional coupling has been reported
for the divergently transcribed artJ and lkt promoters [23].
However, the role of this regulatory feature during transmission of bacteria through host populations is not
known. The chimeric promoter was found in all M.
haemolytica + M. glucosida strains in the present study, irregardless of their propensity to cause disease, suggesting
that it evolved in response to selection for something else
than making their hosts sick.
Evolutionary rates for CP sequences
The role for natural selection in the evolution of regulatory regions is quite unclear [24]. Recognisable features
and motifs are often labile, small in size, and may depend
on the sequence context [25,26]. Therefore, the complex
structure of these regions could be due to alternative evolutionary forces [27-30]: (i) compensatory selection
occurring when a pair of mutations at different sites that
would be singly deleterious produces normal fitness in
combination; (ii) stabilising selection could maintain stable levels of gene expression while allowing mutational
turnover of functional important sites; (iii) purifying
selection could facilitate maintenance of specific functional sites.

Structure and evolution of the intergenic regions upstream of the lkt genes

The evolutionary rates for CP sequences were tested for
deviations from expectations derived from the null
hypothesis of neutral evolution. The overall length of the
16S rRNA tree (obs. T16S) was 0.102024 substitutions per
site, while the overall length of the CP tree (obs. TCP) was
1.33986 substitutions per site. The null hypothesis predicts that the expected length of any given branch on the
CP tree (exp. vCP) can be calculated by multiplying the
observed length of the corresponding branch on the 16S
rRNA tree (obs. v16S) by 1.33986/0.102024 = 13.13292.
The observed and the expected lengths for any given
branch on the CP tree and their pairwise differences are
summarised in Table 2.
For three of four branches ancestral to M. haemolytica serotype A1, the differences between the observed and the

expected branch lengths were significantly smaller than
zero (the value expected under the null hypothesis of neutral evolution) (Table 2). This is in accord with the operation of stronger levels of purifying selection and possibly
reflects an ancient balance between the immune system
and these primarily commensal bacteria and their expression of the LktA protein during asymptomatic colonisation of the nasopharynx. The difference between the
observed and the expected branch lengths ancestral to M.
haemolytica + M. glucosida was not significantly different
from zero (Table 2). This coincided with the translocation
of the artJ operon, including 180-bp of sequence
upstream of the transcribed artJ gene, into the intergenic
region upstream of the lkt genes [21]. It is possible that
this relatively short window of time was dominated by
stabilizing selection on this chimeric region, maintaining

stable levels of lkt (and artJ) expression and thus the
ancient balance between the immune system and bacteria
during asymptomatic colonisation of the nasopharynx.
The difference between the observed and the expected
branch lengths ancestral to M. granulomatis was significantly greater than zero (Table 2). Moreover, the CP
region appeared to be more variable in M. granulomatis,
especially in terms of the overall conservation of cis-regulatory sequences (Figure 2). Most notably, there was a
high level of sequence degeneracy in the core promoter,
which was highly conserved among the other Mannheimia
species. Strains belonging to the bovine taxon of M. granulomatis, including M. granulomatis str. P1135/26T, cause
severe skin infection (lechiguana) [1,31,32]. Interestingly,
these strains have never been isolated from healthy cattle,
including the nasopharynx, and the disease seems to be
acquired by contact with the human botfly (Dermatobia
hominis), i.e. there is no direct transmission between cattle
or transmission is short-lived [33]. Moreover, comparison
of lktA genes from different taxa within M. granulomatis
have shown that those from bovine strains are under significantly relaxed selective constraints (J. Larsen, unpublished results). We propose that genetic diversity of the CP
sequence in this strain reflects functional decay due to
relaxed selection outside the nasopharynx, enabling
mutations to accumulate in the portions of the genome
that encode unused functions in the integumentary system. However, it is also possible that positive Darwinian
selection for alternative cis-regulatory sequences has acted
as a mechanism for coordinating expression of the LktA
protein with the nutritional and environmental conditions of the integument. For example, Larsen et al. [20]
have shown that the β-haemolytic phenotype, a marker of
the lktA genotype in M. haemolytica [34], is present in this
strain, suggesting at least some functional conservation of
the lkt operon.

Evolution of repeat sequences
Tandem repeats of 5'-ACAAAAAACA-3' upstream of the
core promoter were first identified in M. haemolytica serotype A1 str. PHL101 [22]. Our preliminary analysis
revealed three and two repeat units per promoter in M.
haemolytica serotype A1 and serotype A2, respectively (Figure 1). In the latter case, the two repeat units varied from
the consensus sequence by one nucleotide change each
(Figure 2). Because this region accommodated many
sequence variations in the remaining Mannheimia species,
the unit sequence could not be determined, suggesting
that repeat sequences are confined to M. haemolytica.

The relatively recent appearance of three repeat units (at
least after the divergence of M. haemolytica serotype A1
and serotype A2 as reflected in Figure 1) may provide us
with an opportunity to trace the entire evolutionary process back to its origin. Therefore, we examined the number
of repeat units per promoter in 28 additional M. haemolytica strains, which represent the diversity within this species based on MLEE, geographic origin, and host
association (Table 3). The distribution of the number of
repeat units per promoter showed that there were three or
more repeat units in 14 out of 16 M. haemolytica strains
belonging to MLEE lineage A (Table 3). In the two other
strains belonging to MLEE lineage A as well as strains
belonging to MLEE lineages B (n = 7) and C (n = 5), there
were only two repeat units per promoter (Table 3).
The phylogenetic tree of the distal two repeat units from
M. haemolytica showed a strong association between the
sequence of the repeat units, the number of repeat units
per promoter, and the phylogenetic history of this species
(Figure 3). First, repeat tracts containing three or more
repeat units were restricted to MLEE lineage A as described
above and belonged to a cluster (I) of perfect repeat units.
Second, repeat tracts containing two repeat units were

enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) lineages and types have been published previously [2].

localised in two clusters (II and III) according to the
number of repeat units that varied from the consensus
sequence (one and two, respectively) and to the MLEE lineage (B and C, respectively) (Figure 3). These observations
are consistent with the generally accepted view that tandem arrays of perfect repeats, such as those present in M.
haemolytica strains belonging to MLEE lineage A, are
hotspots for replication errors, resulting in high rates of
expansions/contractions.
Role of repeat sequences
M. haemolytica, like other usually commensal bacteria,
must overcome a variety of environmental hurdles to successfully colonise a host, evade the constitutive and inducible defences of this host, migrate from one within-host
habitat to another, and be transmitted to another genetically and immunologically distinct host. Presumably to
meet these challenges, some bacteria have highly mutable
contingency genes that undergo phenotypic switching
(phase shifting) [35].

Although the LktA protein plays a role in evading host
immunity in the lungs, it may also function as a nasopha-

ryngeal colonization and survival factor. We propose that,
in response to the selective pressures associated with the
host immune system, expression of the LktA protein is
maintained at a baseline level during nasopharyngeal colonisation within individual hosts and asymptomatic
nose-to-nose transmission between hosts, while expression is above the baseline level during pulmonary infection.
We further propose that expansions/contractions in the
number of perfect repeat units in the lkt promoter are
associated with phase-variable expression of the LktA protein. The repeat units contain the characteristic sequences
of the so-called A-tracts, which are in phase with the helical repeat (i.e. at 10–11 bp intervals). These upstream Atracts function together as transcriptional enhancers and
appear to exhibit inherent DNA curvature [22,23].
Although the precise mechanism of action of these bacterial enhancers is still unknown, this theory is at least partly
supported by previous empirical works [36-38], which
demonstrated a strong, but not necessarily direct, relationship between the number of A-tracts per promoter and the
level of promoter strength.

Evolution of the repeat sequences in M. haemolytica. Maximum-parsimony tree of the two distal repeat units from each
promoter (A) and repeat tract polymorphisms (B) using M. haemolytica strains, which represent the diversity within this species
based on MLEE, geographic origin, and host association. See the text for clusters I, II, and III. The green and red boxes highlight
polymorphic sites that match and differ, respectively, from the consensus sequence. The number of repeat units per promoter
is indicated. Sequence names contain the strain ID and abbreviations of the corresponding MLEE lineage (A, B, or C).
The hypothesis that phase shifting is correlated with pulmonary infection rests on the idea that virulence is a consequence of the within-host evolution for proliferation
into new tissues. We tested this hypothesis retrospectively
by analysing the frequency distribution of genetic variants
among 17 M. haemolytica serotype A1 strains isolated from
the two within-host habitats (Table 4).
The alignment showed significant sequence and positional conservation over the entire 406-bp stretch among

all strains, with the exception that they contained different
numbers of repeat units per promoter (data not shown).
All strains isolated from the nasopharynx of healthy cattle
and representing at least two epidemiological clones
based on outer membrane protein (OMP) typing (OMP
types 1.2 and 1.4) contained three perfect repeat units per
promoter (Table 4). The majority of strains isolated from
the lungs of cattle with pulmonary infection and representing at least three epidemiological clones (OMP types
1.1, 1.2, and 1.3) also contained three perfect repeat units

membrane protein (OMP) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) types have been published previously [53].

per promoter, with the exception of two strains (both
OMP type 1.2), which contained four perfect repeat units
per promoter (Table 4).
The presence of three repeat units per promoter in strains
from both within-host habitats suggests that this pattern
is associated with a commensal lifestyle in the nasopharynx and that the occasional movement of these bacteria
into the lungs may be due to coincidental spill over from
the nasopharynx. By contrast, strains containing four
repeat units per promoter were confined to the lungs. This
observation supports the view that genetic change(s) is
(are) required for successful colonisation of the lungs
under certain conditions.
Consider an inoculum of M. haemolytica that has entered
the nasopharynx of a host. Furthermore, assume that successful colonisation of the lungs requires (at least) one
change (i.e. addition of one repeat unit) to generate the
necessary phenotype (i.e. high-level expression of the
LktA protein). Whether or not these mutants exist in the
potentially colonising population depends on the total
number of cells in the nasopharynx, the fraction of the
inoculum that enters the lungs, the rates at which the
required genetic change is generated by mutation, and the
duration of the carrier state (i.e. the number of generations that survive in the nasopharynx before the population becomes extinct).
This analysis has several potential limitations. First, strain
pairs collected from the nasopharynx and lungs of indi-

vidual hosts with pulmonary infection (rather than from
healthy and sick hosts, respectively) should be used to
infer within-host evolution. Second, we were unable to
perform in vivo tests of the predictions generated from this
analysis because of the lack of a good animal model for M.
haemolytica.
Selection for phase shifting
Whether or not virulence associated with phase shifting
will be selected at an epidemiological level depends on
the trade-off between the transmission advantage accruing to the cell during short bouts of symptoms (sneezing
and coughing) and the loss in long-term asymptomatic
nose-to-nose transmission due to either increased clearance, rapid host death, or reduced fitness in the nasopharynx, which is the port-of-entry in new hosts.

If symptoms (sneezing and coughing) and transmission
are coupled so the more rapid phase shifting (more virulent) bacteria are transmitted at higher rates than the more
slow (benign) ones, phase shifting (virulence) would be
favoured in the bacterial population. This epidemiological selection model is supported by the apparent evolutionary success of the high virulence M. haemolytica
serotype A1/A6 [2].
However, if the genetic and phenotypic changes associated with enhanced fitness in the lungs are detrimental to
the bacteria back in the nasopharynx, they are unlikely to
confer any long-term advantage in their ability to spread
from the lungs of one host to the nasopharynx of another

unless revertant changes occur. In this case, disease is a
dead end for these bacteria and is a consequence of shortsighted within-host evolution.
If the asymptomatic and symptomatic sites overlap as in
the case of respiratory disease, sneezing and coughing
generated by the lung-adapted phenotype could favour
transmission of freeriders that remain adapted to the
nasopharynx, even when disease is a dead end (i.e. revertant changes do not occur, thus preventing transmission
of revertant cells to the nasopharynx of new hosts). In
other words, freeriders benefit from the collective action
without paying the necessary cost associated with the
transmission-enhancing feature.
Finally, we present a second model of the epidemiology
and within-host infection dynamics of M. haemolytica not
considered above. Our association analysis showed that
the nucleotide change leading to the origin of short tandem arrays of perfect repeat units coincided with the evolutionary success of M. haemolytica strains belonging to
MLEE lineage A, including relatively benign ones that colonise the ovine nasopharynx asymptomatically and rarely
cause disease. To understand the selective forces responsible for phase shifting in these bacteria, which are not
invariably pathogenic, it is important to consider its relevance to the commensal existence of these bacteria at an
epidemiological level, as a mechanism to facilitate colonisation of genetically and immunologically diverse hosts.

Conclusion
The continuous circulation of Mannheimia bacteria in host
populations seems to depend on their capacity for asymptomatic nose-to-nose transmission, although other routes
of transmission may exist for some species. Our analysis
suggests that the origin of short tandem arrays of perfect
repeat units have contributed to the derived virulence
phenotype of M. haemolytica serotype A1/A6 by allowing
phase-variable expression of the LktA protein. Further
studies are required to better understand the epidemiology of these opportunistic pathogens. Areas of study
should include testing the predictions generated from this
analysis using both prospective (experimental) and retrospective (epidemiological) methods.

Methods
Taxa used
For this study we included M. haemolytica serotype A1 str.
PHL213, M. haemolytica serotype A2 str. CCUG 12392T,
M. glucosida serotype A11 str. P925T, M. ruminalis str.
HPA113, M. granulomatis str. P1135/26T, and M. varigena
str. 177T to balance the number of representatives from
the five species within genus Mannheimia (Table 1). These
strains have been represented in previous studies by
Angen et al. [1,39-41] and Larsen et al. [20,21].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/121

Sequence analysis
The intergenic regions upstream of the lkt genes were
aligned using Dialign 2 [42] with default settings. This
segment-based multiple alignment program is known to
produce better alignments for the purpose of phylogenetic
footprinting than does the tree-based global multiple
alignment program ClustalW [43], because it starts by
identifying short conserved regions and then incorporates
them into a multiple alignment [44].
Estimation of evolutionary rates for CP sequences
The relationships of the strains in this study were inferred
with 16S rRNA; these sequences have been used successfully for systematic studies in genus Mannheimia [1,20].
The 16S rRNA sequences were aligned using Dialign 2
[42] with default settings.

Phylogenetic inference from 16S rRNA and CP sequences
(Figure 2) was done under the criterion of maximum-likelihood (ML) using PAUP* version 4.0b10 for UNIX [45].
The best fitting model for both data sets was Hasegawa,
Kishino, and Yano's [46,47] model with a discrete fourcategory gamma distribution [47] of substitution rate
among different nucleotide sites (HKY85 + Γ ) based on
the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) computed by the
programs Modeltest version 3.06 [48] and PAUP* version
4.0b10 for UNIX [45].
We estimated all HKY85 + Γ model parameters (nucleotide frequencies, substitution rates (μ), branch lengths
(ν), gamma shape parameter) from the 16S rRNA data set.
The 16S rRNA tree topology was also found to be the single best estimate when using the program MrBayes version
3.0B4 [49], having a posterior probability (PP) of 100%.
The tree was rooted using the M. varigena str. 177T
sequence as outgroup.
We then used the 16S rRNA tree topology as the basis for
determining the ML estimates of the HKY85 + Γ model
parameters from the CP data set, assuming that the 16S
rRNA tree topology is a correct representation of the phylogeny connecting the investigated strains. The evolutionary rates for CP sequences were tested for deviation from
expectations derived from a neutral evolution model. The
null hypothesis is that the 16S rRNA and CP sequences
have evolved under neutral evolution on the same tree
topology but at different rates. If this is the case, we would
expect the CP tree to be a scaled version of the 16S rRNA
tree (with some noise due to the stochasticity in the substitution process). The null hypothesis predicts the following relationship between the expected length of any given
branch on the CP tree and the observed length of the corresponding branch on the 16S rRNA tree:

exp .v CP = obs.v16S × (obs.TCP / obs.T16S ),
Page 10 of 12

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2009, 9:121

where T is the total tree length.
To test whether the observed branch lengths on the CP
tree deviate significantly from what we expect under the
null hypothesis of neutral evolution, we performed a socalled parametric bootstrapping analysis [50,51]. The program evolver from the PAML package [52] was used to
construct 1,000 synthetic "CP-like" data sets by simulating sequence evolution on the CP tree and using the
HKY85 + Γ model parameters estimated from the real CP
data set. These synthetic "CP-like" data sets are representatives of CP sequences that have evolved under neutral
evolution and they can therefore be used to test whether
the observed length of any given branch on the CP tree
deviates significantly from what we would expect under
the null hypothesis of neutral evolution. We used the program BASEML from the PAML package [52] to perform a
ML analysis for each of the 1,000 synthetic "CP-like" data
sets using the HKY85 + Γ model. For each branch in the
1,000 synthetic "CP-like" trees, we then computed the difference between the observed and the expected branch
lengths and tested whether these differences were significantly different from zero (the value expected under the
null hypothesis of neutral evolution) by calculating twotailed p-values adjusted by the Bonferroni correction for
multiple tests (as we have no a priori expectation whether
the variation of the difference between the observed and
the expected branch lengths should be greater (diversifying evolution) or smaller (unifying evolution) than zero,
this test is two-sided).
Phylogenetic analysis of repeat sequences in M.
haemolytica
The number of repeat units per promoter was examined
using 28 M. haemolytica strains representing the diversity
within this species based on MLEE, geographic origin, and
host association (Table 3) and 17 M. haemolytica serotype
A1 strains collected from the nasopharynx of healthy cattle and the lungs from cattle with pulmonary infection
(Table 4). These strains have been represented in previous
studies by Davies et al. [2] and McCluskey et al. [53],
respectively. To amplify the intergenic regions in these
strains, we designed the forward primer lktpro_UP (5'CCACACACCCGAATAAAAGGGTCAAAAGTG-3') and the
reverse primer lktpro_DOWN (5'-GGAGTTCATCCATAGCCAAGTAATGTTTCC-3') from conserved sequences in
the 5' and 3' flanking genes between the M. haemolytica +
M. glucosida strains. The reaction conditions were 2.5 U
Taq polymerase, 16 mM (NH4)2SO4, 67 mM Tris-HCl,
0.01% Tween-20, 2.5 mM Mg2SO4, each primer at 0.5
mM, and each nucleotide at 0.1 mM. The cycling conditions were initial denaturation at 94°C followed by 25
cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 52°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s,
finishing with extension at 72°C for 10 min. These PCR
products were then directly sequenced.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/121

A phylogenetic tree of the two distal repeat units from 30
M. haemolytica strains (Tables 1 and 3) was reconstructed
using the maximum-parsimony method as implemented
in the program PAUP* version 4.0b10 for UNIX [45]. The
first site of the unit sequence was defined arbitrarily by
using the AluI restriction site as a landmark [23].
