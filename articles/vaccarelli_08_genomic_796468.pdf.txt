Abstract
Background: In humans and mice ("γδ low species") less than 5% of the peripheral blood T
lymphocytes are gamma/delta T cells, whereas in chicken and artiodactyls ("γδ high species")
gamma/delta T cells represent about half of the T cells in peripheral blood. In cattle and sheep
(Bovidae) two paralogous T cell receptor gamma loci (TRG1 and TRG2) have been found. TRG1
is located on 4q3.1, within a region of homology with the human TRG locus on chromosome 7,
while TRG2 localizes on 4q2.2 and appears to be unique to ruminants. The purpose of this study
was the sequencing of the genomic regions encompassing both loci in a "γδ high" organism and the
analysis of their evolutionary history.
Results: We obtained the contiguous genomic sequences of the complete sheep TRG1 and TRG2
loci gene repertoire and we performed cattle/sheep sequence analysis comparison using data
available through public databases. Dot plot similarity matrix comparing the two sheep loci with
each other has shown that variable (V), joining (J) and constant (C) genes have evolved through a
series of duplication events involving either entire cassettes, each containing the basic V-J-J-C
recombinational unit, or single V genes. The phylogenetic behaviour of the eight enhancer-like
elements found in the sheep, compared with the single copy present in the human TRG locus, and
evidence from concordant insertions of repetitive elements in all analyzed TRGJ blocks allowed us
to infer an evolutionary scenario which highlights the genetic "flexibility" of this region and the
duplication-driven evolution of gene cassettes. The strong similarity of the human and Bovidae
intergenic J-J-C regions, which display an enhancer-like element at their 3' ends, further supports
their key role in duplications.
Conclusion: We propose that only duplications of entire J-J-C regions that possessed an
enhancer-like element at their 3' end, and acquired at least one V segment at their 5' end, were
selected and fixed as functional recombinational units.

Background
In vertebrates cellular immunity is based on antigen recognition by αβ or γδ T cell receptors (TR) chains. Although
γδ T cells share many functions and features with αβ T
cells, they are unique because of their thymic development, their antigen recognition (they recognize soluble
protein and non protein antigens without MHC restriction) [1,2], and their tissue distribution. In general γδ T
cells show an intermediate phenotype between innate and
adaptive immunity, and exhibit a pronounced immunoregulatory function [3]. T cell receptor variable
domains are assembled during lymphocyte development
from V, D, and J segments by V(D)J recombination. In
developing T cells, specific molecular mechanisms target
the recombinase activity to appropriate TR loci according
to the allelic exclusion rule. This recombinase targeting at
the level of the substrate locus, is known as recombinational accessibility [4-6]. The enhancer elements are
involved in controlling the accessibility since they govern
the general accessibility of each locus in V(D)J recombination. Deletion of the enhancers abolishes rearrangements
in the TRB locus and greatly reduces rearrangements in the
TRA locus [7]. In TRA/TRD and TRB loci a tightly correlation has been demonstrated between histone acetylation
and V(D)J recombination and a mechanism for coupling
enhancer activity with accessibility has been proposed
[8,9].
The percentage of γδ T cells is variable among species.
Sheep and cattle, as well as swine [10], and chicken [11],
are considered "γδ high" species. In young ruminants the
circulating γδ T cells account for more than 50% of circulating blood cells, but this percentage decreases to 5% by
adulthood [12]. On the other hand, in "γδ low" species,
like humans and mice, although the proportion of γδ T
cells in the blood decreases with age, even before adulthood their percentage is consistently lower than in "γδ
high" species. Moreover for both "γδ low and high" species γδ T cells can represent up to 50% of the lymphocytes
in epithelium-rich tissues, such as the skin, the gut and the
reproductive tract [1].
While γδ T cells from humans and mice have been extensively studied in their function, antigen responsiveness
and structural organization of the genomic loci coding for
the γ and δ chains, less is known in γδ high species. Bovine
γδ T cells are able to respond to nonpeptidic molecules
derived from Mycobacteria, including isopentenylpyrophosphate (IPP) [13]. Whatever the role of γδ T cells in
cellular immunity the mechanisms, which led to a significant increase of these cells in young ruminants and chickens, are still unknown. In sheep, the TRG locus has a
double chromosomal localization on the 4q3.1 (TRG1)
and 4q2.2 (TRG2) chromosome bands; the locus is localized on the homologous bands in cattle, goat and river

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/81

buffalo. Only TRG1 is found within a region of the Ovis
aries genome which is syntenic with the human region
containing the TRG locus on chromosome 7, while the
TRG2 locus appears to be unique to ruminants [14,15].
The organisation of loci in their basic structure was determined, each locus consisting of three cassettes composed
by one variable (V), two joining (J) and one constant (C)
genes lying in the same transcriptional orientation
[16,17].
In humans and mice the structure of the TRG locus is
peculiar when compared to the other T cell receptor loci,
since only a few genes encode γ chains [18-20], while a
repertoire of more than 50 genes, distributed in long
arrays of V and/or J genes, encodes α and β chains [20].
Moreover, in the TRG locus a considerably higher number
of C genes is found in ruminants, than in other mammalian species: for example, there are only two TRGC genes
in human [18-20] and four, of which one is a pseudogene,
in mouse [21]. It has been proposed [2] that different
TRGC genes, each possessing unique connecting regions
[22], could mediate different cellular responses after the T
cell receptor has engaged the antigen. In cattle the expression of specific TRGC genes may be restricted to specific
lymphocyte T populations [23,24].
In this study our aims were: i) to determine the overall
genomic arrangement of the sheep TRG1 and TRG2 loci
by assembling their contiguous genomic sequences; ii) to
outline the sequence of events that gave rise to the current
structural organisation of the two TRG loci. Closer inspection of the cassettes, each containing the basic V-J-J-C unit,
using evidence from DNA sequence relationships and
repetitive elements insertion allowed us to propose a
model highlighting the cassette duplication-driven evolution in Bovidae.

Results and Discussion
Overall arrangement of TRG1 and TRG2 loci in sheep
T cell receptor gene families exhibit tremendous genetic
diversity, not only in the number of genes, but also in the
rearrangements used to create protein coding sequences
[19,20]. In previous papers we described the entire ovine
repertoire of the variable (V), joining (J) and constant (C)
ovine genes and their organization in the TRG1 and TRG2
loci. The isolation of five TRG1 BAC clones and two TRG2
BAC clones, their sub-cloning in plasmid vectors and the
sequencing of their inserts allowed us to obtain contiguous genomic sequences spanning 158.8 Kb for TRG1
[available in GEDI for GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ and IMGT/
LIGM-DB: DQ992075] and 95.0 Kb for TRG2 [available
in GEDI for GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ and IMGT/LIGM-DB:
DQ992074].

In the γδ high Bovidae lineage, as pointed out by recent
phylogenetic results on cattle and sheep variable genes,
the complex TRG1 locus, containing the ancestral V-J-C
cassette, contrasts with the more recent TRG2 locus presumably originated by a translocation event [17]. Furthermore, an enhanced expression deriving from a
coordinated expansion of TRDV1 subgroup genes of the
variable δ repertoire was recently discovered in adult
sheep [25].
The availability of the complete sequence of the ovine
TRG loci allowed us to attempt a reconstruction of the succession of events that shaped their current genomic organization starting from the most likely ancestral locus, and
led to the rapid expansion of their copy number. We first
analysed the compositional properties (G + C content) of
the sequences obtained and identified tandem and interspersed repeated sequences. The GC content of 40.6% is
almost identical for the two ovine clusters and is consistent with the general observation that SINE-rich regions
have a high GC content.
The Tandem Repeats Finder program identified 26 different tandem repeats in the TRG1 locus and 14 in TRG2.
Repeats vary in monomer length from 2 to 142 bp for
TRG1 and from 2 to 46 bp for TRG2, and in copy number
from 1.9 to 23.5 for TRG1 and from 2 to 28.5 for TRG2
(See Additional file 1, Table S1a, b).
With regard to the interspersed repeated elements, the
analysis carried out through the Repeat Masker program
provided the results summarized in additional Tables a
(TRG1) and b (TRG2) (See Additional file 2, Table S2a, b)
and presented in detail in additional Tables c and d (See
Additional file 3, Table S3c, d). The density of total repeats
both in TRG1 (30.39%) and in TRG2 (32.59%), is slightly
lower than the density reported for the TRG loci of man
and mouse [19]. SINEs are the most abundant elements in
the ovine loci as in their human (16.32%) and murine
counterpart (14.83%).
Fig. 1 shows the overall organization of the ovine TRG1
and TRG2 loci. It should be noted that according to an
IMGT suggestion (correspondence with MP Lefranc) as an
upgrade to the nomenclature used in previous reports, in
the present report, we will use the term "cassette" instead
of "cluster" when referring to the "V-J-J-C" units belonging
to the sheep and bovine TRG loci. Fig. 1 shows the entire
TRG1 locus, which encompasses three cassettes, TRGC5,
TRGC3 and TRGC4, named according to the constant
genes [16,17,26-29] and following the recommendations
of the IMGT Nomenclature Committee. The limit dividing
the three cassettes from each other was set at approximately 4–5 Kb downstream of the last exon of each C
gene. Similarly Fig. 1 shows the entire TRG2 locus, con-

sisting of TRGC1, TRGC2 and TRGC6 cassettes. All TRG
cassettes lie in the same transcriptional orientation and
are closely spaced. In each "V-J-J-C" cassette, the V gene
and a J gene rearrange and, after transcription, the V-J is
then spliced to the relevant C in mature transcripts
[17,26]. The only exception is the TRGC1, where the variable V5-1 is rearranged with J1-1 and/or J1-2, both spliced
to C2 [17]. We detected by RT-PCR the transcripts for all
genes belonging to TRGC5 [17], including the TRGV10-1
gene [29], which contains a premature stop codon in exon
2 [17]. Furthermore we identified the V11-1 gene, never
before described, which was deposited [GenBank:
DQ992075]. V11-1 belongs to the TRGC5 5' region,
presents 79% nucleotidic similarity with the functional
human counterpart TRGV9 [GenBank: NG_001336], has
a premature stop codon and has never been found transcribed. All C-proximal (Jp) and C-distal (Jd) J genes have
been found transcribed in adult and foetus with the only
exception of the J5-2, located in the middle [27]. J3-2,
wrongly previously reported as a vestigial form [17],
presents the FVNGIKF motif and a premature stop codon
at 3' end of coding region. With regard to the C genes, it
should be noted that EX1, corresponding to the disulfidelinked constant domain, and EX3, corresponding to the
transmembrane and cytoplasmatic domains, are similar
in length in all genes. Conversely, the EX2A, EX2B and
EX2C exons, which encode the connecting region, differ
between C genes both in number and length (Fig. 1). The
only peculiar feature being C1 gene, where the presence of
only the first three codons in EX2B has been demonstrated [28].
Comparison of TRG1 and TRG2 loci in Bovidae
Figs. 2 and 3 show the dotplot matrixes comparing the
sequence of each ovine locus against itself. As expected for
loci consisting of a series of clusters of correlated genes,
the matrixes show numerous homologous regions of various sizes. The most continuous block of similarity exists
between the J-C regions of the TRG cassettes and the longest similarity block starting from V and ending in C
regions is found at the diagonal concerning TRGC2 vs.
TRGC1 in Figure 3. In Figure 2 the TRGC3 vs. TRGC4 similarity extends to the V regions while the 5' region of the
TRGC5 cassette, characterized by the presence of six V
genes, does not show similarity with any other region of
the entire locus, except partially with itself. This is also
true for the single V gene (V6-1) belonging to TRGC6 cassette in the TRG2 locus.

All the genes and intergenic regions of the TRGC2 and
TRGC1 blocks, feature high identity levels (Table 1); the
region of similarity is largely uninterrupted and the duplicated blocks appear superimposed "end to end". Thus the
duplication that originated the TRGC2 and TRGC1 units
is likely to have occurred very recently. Duplication events

(TRGV8-1, TRGV2-1, TRGV9-1) and 6 (TRGV11-1,
TRGV3-1, TRGV3-2, TRGV7, TRGV10-1, TRGV4,) genes in
the TRGC3 and TRGC5 cassettes respectively (Fig. 2). We
have compared cattle contiguous sequences [AY644517]
(See Additional file 4, Figure S4), [NW_937068] (not
shown) and [AY644518] (Fig. 4) [29] vs. the sheep TRG1
and vs. the sheep TRG2 loci. Considering TRG1, there are
7 genes in the TRGC3 cassette in bovine but only 3 in
ovine. The TRG2 sequences from cattle and sheep are
superimposable with the following exception: a) there is a
deletion of exons 2B and 2C in ovine TRGC1 (triangles in
Fig. 4); b) there are two sequence gaps in the intergenic
region that is one between TRGV5-2 and TRGJ2-1 and
another one from the TRGV6-2 exonic region to TRGJ6-1
(squares) due to two TRGV-J rearrangements observed in
the bovine TRG2 (See Additional file 5, Figure S5) [29]; c)

there are two TRGV6 genes in bovine but only one in
ovine.
Fig. 5 shows the dotplot matrix comparing the sequences
of TRG1 vs. TRG2 ovine loci. The conservation of the J-J-C
region of each cassette, starting from the distal J gene and
ending at 3' of the C gene, is quite straightforward. Also
the absence of similarity diagonals is evident for the V
genes of the TRGC5 cassette vs. all other Vs of the TRG2
locus and for the single TRGV6-1 gene of TRGC6 cassette
vs. all the other V of the TRG1 locus. Instead in the comparison of TRGC3 and TRGC4 cassettes vs. TRGC2 and
TRGC1 cassettes the conservation of similarity is extended
to the whole block from the 5' region of the TRGV9-1 gene
up to 3' of the C4 gene. Therefore the TRGV5-1 and
TRGV5-2 genes seem to be equally correlated to TRGV8-1,
TRGV2-1, TRGV9-1 and TRGV1 genes of the TRG1 locus.

appear to have involved either the entire V-J-J-C unit, as in

TRG2 locus share high identity percentage with the
regions located at 3' of C4, C3 and C5 genes and with the
region at 5' of TRGV2-1 and TRGV9-1 genes of the TRG1
locus.
Fig. 5 highlights in each locus the conservation in similarity and in length of the intergenic regions inclusive of the
C gene of a cassette and the V gene of the next cassette, the
only difference lying in the C5 – V8-1 region that is rich in
repeated elements, which are the main cause of its peculiar behaviour in the matrix. These C-V intergenic regions
are characterized by the presence of a sequence similar to
the only single copy of the TRG locus enhancer localized
at 3' of the human C2 gene [30] (See accession number
and positions in the sequence for the human TRG
enhancer sequence in Methods). From now on this

sequence will be referred to as the enhancer-like sequence.
In the TRG2 locus the enhancer-like sequence is present in
four copies distributed either immediately downstream of
the C6, C2 and C1 genes or immediately upstream of
TRGV5-1. The TRG1 locus contains five copies of the
enhancer-like sequence, localized immediately downstream of the C5, C3 and C4 genes or immediately
upstream of TRGV2-1 and TRGV9-1. Fig. 6 shows a phylogram obtained from the alignment of a common region
about 900 bp long of eight of the nine enhancer-like
sequences analyzed. The division of the phylogram in
three parts (A, B and C) is useful to understand the evolutionary relationship of the analyzed sequences. The upper
part (A) features the human enhancer element. The middle part (B) features a cluster with including the sheep
enhancer-like sequences located at the 5' end of TRGV5-1
(TRGC1) and the sequences at the 3' end of C2 and C1
constant genes, which derive from the most recent duplications. The lower part (C) refers to a cluster containing
both the sheep enhancer-like sequences at the 3' end of
the oldest C5, C6 and C3 and at 5' end of TRGV2-1
(TRGC3) and TRGV9-1 (TRGC3).
Relationships between the variable genes of TRG1 and
TRG2 loci
The total lack of similarity of the V genes of the TRGC5
cassette and the single V gene of the TRGC6 cassette with
all the remaining Vs (Figs. 2, 3, and 5) suggests their more
ancient origin, in accord with the phylogenetic results
obtained, which highlighted the existence of an ancient
TRGC5 cassette in cattle and sheep [16]. Human/mouse/
Bovidae comparison data presented in the last subsection
of Results and Discussion support this "evolutionary
freezing" which appears to have only concerned the
genomic regions containing the V genes involved in antigen recognition, excluding them from the subsequent

duplications of Bovidae TRG loci. On the other hand, similarities were found between V genes belonging to the
TRGC3, TRGC4, TRGC2 and TRGC1 cassettes. We used
several features of the dot plot to help deduce the nature
of the duplication events that occurred.
The areas of high similarity related to the TRGV8-1,
TRGV2-1, TRGV9-1 and TRGV1 genes (Figs. 2 and 5),
stretching from 5' to 3' ends (average of 6–12 Kb), may
help define the most probable duplicative events that
occurred in the TRGC3 V region. In particular:
i) it is clear that TRGV2-1 and TRGV9-1 originated
through an extended duplication that mostly concerned
their 5', where the similarity region appears a little fragmented in the matrix.
ii) TRGV1 shows in its upstream position a short similarity region shared with TRGV8-1, but absent in TRGV2-1

and TRGV9-1 (blue circle in Fig. 2); the same upstream
region is present, though less expanded, in TRGV8-1 and
TRGV1 vs. TRGV5-2, but is lost in TRGV8-1 and TRGV1 vs.
TRGV5-1 (blue circle in Fig. 5).
Considering the succession of evolutive events proposed
in previous reports [16] (according to which the cassette
TRGC3 is more recent than TRGC5, but older than
TRGC4) and the similarities highlighted in the previous
point ii, we can hypothesize that the duplication of the
entire TRGC3 cassette (V8-1, J3-1, J3-2, C3) originated
TRGC4 (V1, J4-1, J4-2, C4). This hypothesis is in agreement with the data on the distribution of the repeated elements shown in Table 2, since TRGV8-1 shares with
TRGV1 six out of nine elements in 5'V.
In consideration of point i) and of data in Fig. 6, we can
therefore hypothesize that TRGV2-1 (or TRGV9-1) was
initially generated by the duplication of a genomic region

region including the newly formed one. It is not possible
to unequivocally establish the order of events that originated the TRGV2-1 and TRGV9-1 genes, whether TRGV21, TRGV9-1 or TRGV9-1, TRGV2-1. Moreover, the identity
data (from comparison of regions of about 2.2 Kb around
and inclusive of TRGV1 vs. the corresponding regions of
TRGV8-1, TRGV2-1 and TRGV9-1) indicates a higher
resemblance of TRGV1 with TRGV9-1 than with TRGV8-1
or TRGV2-1 (Table 1). In addition the 3' region of TRGV1
compared to TRGV9-1 features 80% identity, which is
higher than the identity with the corresponding TRGV2-1
region (74.9%) (red circles in Fig. 2). As mentioned
above, the comparison of identity percentages presented
(Tab. 1) does not highlight a significantly higher identity
for any gene pair, the only exceptions being TRGV5-l and

TRGV5-2 identity values vs. TRGV1 of 79.8 and 79.4%,
respectively suggesting their possible origin from this
gene.
Evolution of TRGJ blocks in Bovidae
The results obtained so far are in accordance with previously obtained comparative data on Bovidae and human
germline promoters located at the 5' of each C-distal J (Jd)
gene. This data strongly supports a key role of such promoters in determining local accessibility to the site-specific recombinational machinery [27,31]. Figs. 7 and 8,
generated using the mVISTA program, show the comparison of each TRGJ block with the others.

The mVISTA program provides a multi-alignment of
nucleotide sequences and highlights their local similarity
regions in the compared genomic regions. Indeed, since
the insertion of a mobile element in a given position of
the genome is a rather unique event, the presence in the
same genomic position in different homologous regions
can be used to infer a common origin [32,33]. The comparative analysis of the TRGJ blocks(dark green rectangles
in Fig. 5), was particularly useful to formulate a plausible
model of the formation and evolution of the ovine TRG
loci. The analysis was conducted considering three different parameters: 1) the regions featuring a similarity higher
than 70% shared by coding and non coding regions
obtained by multialigned TRGJ blocks (Figs. 7 and 8); 2)
the repeated elements shared by the six cassettes displayed
in Table 2 and Fig. 9; 3) the similarity values obtained
from comparing all the TRGJ regions using the mVISTA
program (See Additional file 6, Table S6).
By looking at the so-called "peaks and valleys" mVISTA
graphs obtained by comparison of each TRGJ block with
all the others, the following considerations can be made:
i) a high similarity is preserved between the regions right
uphill and downstream of the C-distant J (Jd) (Figs. 7 and
8); ii) the region including the J5-2 between J5-1 and J5-3
(Fig. 7a), presents a similarity peak higher than 70% only
in the alignment TRGJ5 vs. TRGJ3 and vice versa (squares
in a e b); iii) the region immediately at 5' of the C-proximal J (Jp) gene in each unit seems to be similar in TRGJ6,
TRGJ3, TRGJ4, TRGJ2 and TRGJ1 and different in TRGJ5
(dot line square in Fig. 7b, c and Fig. 8a, b, c); these
regions immediately at 5'of each Jp gene have become
homogeneous in all cassettes, with the exception of
TRGJ5, maybe for one or more gene conversion events
that initially involved only TRGJ3 and TRGJ6 blocks; iv)
the TRGJ6 block, more significantly, and the TRGJ3 block
would seem to be deleted in 3' Jp region (horizontal rectangles in Fig. 7a, c, and Fig. 8a, b).
In consideration of the above observations, the TRGJ
blocks can be clearly sub-divided into two groups based

Repeat elements as landmarks of evolution of TRGJ blocks
Repeat elements as landmarks of evolution of TRGJ

TRGJ block. The repeats shared by two (bold) or more (regular) TRGJ blocks are numbered as in Table 2.

on their "resemblance" and sharing of repeated elements.
Some of these have provided valuable information suggesting the most likely succession of events.
One group consists of the TRGJ6 and TRGJ5 (Fig. 9), since
these two blocks share repeats r23 e r24 that the remaining four blocks lack. r19, r20 and r31 are shared by all
blocks. Finally, r22 is present in all blocks except TRGJ5,
while r25, is always present except in TRGJ6. For these two
repeats, we can hypothesize that a rearrangement, which
could have generated the third J in TRGJ5, may have
obscured their phylogenetic origin. The region including
the J5-2 gene was subsequently lost in all cassettes except
TRGC3, where only residual sequences from the region
remain (Fig. 7). A series of specific shared repeats (See
Table 2 and Additional file 7, Figure S7) substantiate the
scenario depicted in the next section: r15 is shared only by
TRGJ5 and TRGJ3, just like r21 is shared by TRGJ3 and
TRGJ4. r17 keeps its sharing starting from TRGJ3, up to
TRGJ4, TRGJ1 and TRGJ2, while r27 and r28 are shared by
TRGJ4, TRGJ1 and TRGJ2. The most recent shared insertions, present only in blocks TRGJ1 and TRGJ2, are r16,
r18, r26 and r29. This latter data, together with the similarities of the TRGV1 vs. TRGV5-2 rather than of TRGV1
vs. TRGV5-1, as mentioned above in the analysis ii) of the
matrix in Fig. 5 and the set of data presented in Fig. 6, led
us to assume the origin of cassette TRGC1 by duplication
of cassette TRGC2.
Concerning the shared repeats in genomic regions relating
to the C genes, the parameter of the common repeats may
be used only in the regions immediately at 5'(r29, r30 and
r31), in I intron (r32 and r33) and immediately at 3'(r46
and r47) of the coding segment (Table 2). Repeated gene
conversion, duplication and deletion events concerning
exons II have probably obscured the evolutive relationship of these genes. However, the phylogenetic analysis
conducted only on the coding regions of C genes [28] sup-

ports the succession of events hypothesized in the evolutionary scenario proposed in Fig. 10.
A model for the evolution of the V-J-J-C cassettes in ovine
TRG1 and TRG2 loci
The distribution of the "similarity peaks" (>70%)
obtained through the mVISTA program by comparing
each TRJG block against all the others (Figs. 7 and 8) as
well as evidence from the presence or absence of repeated
elements in different TRJG blocks (Fig. 9) and from similarity percentages between all TRJG blocks (See Additional
file 6, Table S6) provided us the basis to propose a model
for the formation of sheep TRG loci, although multiple
gene conversion events, which complicate this analysis,
have almost certainly occurred. The model will be discussed by referring in turn to each numbered panel of Fig.
10. We propose that after the duplication of a minimum
ancestral cassette consisting of one V, three Js and one C
genes, the ancestral TRG locus consisted of two cassettes,
which had the repeated elements r23 and r24 in common
and probably were the forerunners of the TRGC5 and
TRGC6 cassettes. The ancestral cassette likely possessed
three J genes, of which the central one was subsequently
lost in the TRGC6 cassette by a deletion event (panel 2 of
Fig. 10). This hypothesis is supported by the phylogenetic
tree of the J genes, where the bootstrap value close to 85%
indicates a clear subdivision of human and sheep
sequences into two main groups. A third minor group
consists of chicken J genes, human JP and sheep J5-2 [27].
Concerning the six V genes of the TRGC5 cassette, which
present a low level of similarity with the V genes of the
TRGC3, TRGC4, TRGC1 and TRGC2 cassettes, we hypothesize that they are the result of ancestral duplicative events
which only involved V genes presumably in the same
manner as occurred in the human locus (See the last subsection). The specific sharing of repeats and the dot plot
comparison analysis substantiate our scenario that proposes (panel 4 of Fig. 10) the origin of the TRGC3 (V8-1,
J3-1, J3-2, C3) cassette from TRGC5 (Vn.i., J5-1, J5-2, J53, C5). In addition, we postulate the occurrence of a deletion of the region including the centrally positioned
TRGJ5-2 gene (panel 2) as well as gene conversion events
that made the regions immediately to 5' of the Jp in
TRGC3 more similar to the corresponding one of TRGC6
(panel 4) than to the one of TRGC5. Panel 5 shows the
origin of TRGC4 (V1, J4-1, J4-2, C4) from a duplication of
TRGC3. Insertion of repeats r3, r4, r5 and r7, shared by
TRGV8-1 and TRGV1 (Table 2), and repeat r21 found in
the TRGJ3 and TRGJ4 blocks (Table 2), most probably
occurred at this stage.

Panel 6 of Fig. 10 hypothesizes a duplication of the region
containing the 3'C3 enhancer-like sequence inclusive of
TRGV1 that originated TRGV2-1 and also shows the origin
of the TRGC2 cassette by a duplication of the TRGC4 cas-

Hypothetic evolutionary model for the ovine TRG loci
Hypothetic evolutionary model for the ovine TRG loci. The genes are represented (not in scale) as small coloured
boxes with transcriptional orientation from left to right, while the enhancer-like sequences are indicated with a red coloured
E. It is not clear whether the three-Js conformation of the most ancient cassette preceded or followed the formation of the
ancestors of TRGC6 and TRGC5 cassettes (the most probable hypothesis is shown in lines 1 and 2). Rectangles, squared
parentheses and wavy lines are used to indicate the regions involved in duplicative events, deletions and conversions, respectively. Duplications of a cassette or a gene are indicated by two blue coloured head-arrows or by a single dark yellow arrow
while for the chromosome break a flash of lightning was used. The likely insertion of repeats, listed in Table 2 and shown in Fig.

sette. Both events are proposed to have occurred at this
stage because repeats r6 and r12, shared by TRGV2-1,
TRGV1, TRGV5-1 and TRGV5-2 are likely to have been
inserted at the same time. Panel 7 shows a second-step
duplication of the TRGV2-1 region originating TRGV9-1.
Repeat r14, which is shared by TRGV2-1 and TRGV9-1
only, could have been inserted at this time. The analysis of
the repeats and of the phylogenetic tree of Fig. 6 favours a
more recent origin of TRGV9-1 than TRGV2-1. However,
this is in conflict with the dot plot analysis shown in Fig.
2, which indicates that TRGV9-1, in contrast to TRGV2-1
originated directly from TRGV1 or from a gene conversion
event. Panel 7 also shows the origin of the TRGC1 cassette
depicted in panel 8 by duplication of the entire TRGC2.
This reconstruction of the sequence of ancient duplications events illustrated in Fig. 10 is supported not only by

the similarity levels observed (See Additional file 6, Table
S6) but also by the observed concordances in the distribution of the repeated elements: r19, r20 and r31 are shared
by all six TRGJ blocks; repeat r15 is TRGC5 and TRGC3
specific; repeat r21 is TRGC3 and TRGC4 specific, r27 and
r28 are TRGC4, TRGC2 and TRGC1 specific, and finally
r16, r18, r26, r29 and r30, shared by TRGC2 and TRGC1
cassettes, seem to have been the last inserted in the TRG
locus. A further duplication event concerning the 3'C1
enhancer-like sequence region (see panel 8) is proposed
to have originated a region containing two adjoining
enhancer-like sequences following the genesis of the six
cassettes. The TRG2 locus is assumed to have later originated by a chromosomal rearrangement that probably
occurred in the region where two-adjoining enhancer
sequences were located at the 3' of the C4 gene and at the
5' of the TRGV5-1 gene respectively (panel 8). As a result,

a translocation event removed the part of the locus consisting of TRGC1, TRGC2 and TRGC6 cassettes from the
4q3.1 band taking it to the 4q2.2 band.
There is no doubt that some aspects of the model may be
incorrect, especially because some evolutive relationships
might may have been obscured by gene conversion. However, the model highlights the genetic "fluidity" of this
region, that led to a strikingly variable and complex
genetic locus in Bovidae.
Comparison of human, murine and Bovidae TRG loci
When comparing the sheep genomic organization
described above to the human TRG locus [18,20,34], we
find that in Bovidae (cattle, sheep and goat) a significant
number of duplicative events has led to a substantial
increase in the number of V, J and C genes, to the point of
colonizing an additional region of chromosome 4, while
in man duplications are considerable only in the region of
V genes. The human TRG locus spans 160 Kb and features
in its 5' region fourteen variable genes, of which only six
are functional, grouped into six subgroups according to
the identity values [18,20].

PipMaker dotplot matrixes of the ovine TRG1 and TRG2
loci, against the human TRG locus display two identity
diagonals in line with the J-C regions of each ovine cassette (See Additional file 8, Figure S8a, b). This result
reflects the organisation of the two J-C regions duplicated
in tandem in man, which are superimposed "end to end":
the first consists of three J genes (TRGJP1, TRGJP and
TRGJ1) and one C gene (TRGC1) while the second consist
of two J genes (TRGJP2 and TRGJ2) and one C gene
(TRGC2), all functional. In both matrixes, the longest
diagonals refer to block JP2-J2-C2. The apparent greater
length is due to the small diagonals located downstream
of each ovine C and corresponding to the single human
enhancer sequence. The nine variable genes of the human
TRGV1 subgroup, all located at 5' of the locus, include
three pseudogenes (TRGV5P, TRGV6 and TRGV7) and
one ORF (TRGV1) [18,20], and display short similarity
traits, only in the coding part against both the V genes of
TRGC3 and TRGC4 cassettes and those of TRGC1 and
TRGC2. The human functional TRGV9 displays similarity
only with TRGV11-1 of TRGC5, while TRGV10 and
TRGV11 (ORFs) and TRGVB (pseudogene) recognize the
areas corresponding to TRGV3-1, TRGV3-2 and TRGV7.
Finally, the single TRGVA (pseudogene) features one similarity diagonal including both its coding and non-coding
parts against TRGV6-1 of TRGC6 (green square) (See
Additional file 8, Figure S8b). When looking at the human
vs. Bovidae matrixes, the importance that the J-J-C blocks
must have had during the evolution of these loci emerges
clearly. Indeed, these regions, by preserving their intergenic portions, behave quite differently than other regions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/81

of the same locus, as for example those including the V
genes, for which a strong intra-species and inter-species
sequence divergence has been reported [17]. The phylogenetic analyses of the J genes [27] are in full agreement with
this sort of preservation of a spatial constriction in the J-C
regions, at least when considering human and Bovidae
species comparison.
The genomic organisation of the murine TRG locus [GenBank: AF037352] [21] is apparently similar to that of
Bovidae, as it features four V-J-C cassettes for a total length
of about 200 Kb on chromosome 13. The TRGC1 cassette,
which correlates to human, has four V genes, all of which
are functional, one J gene (TRGJ1) and one C gene
(TRGC1) [34] (See Additional file 9, Figure S9a, b); the
TRGC3, TRGC2 and TRGC4 cassettes all consist of one V,
one J and one C, which are non functional in TRGC3 and
display a transcriptional orientation inverted with respect
to the other three cassettes in TRGC2. A sequence putatively serving as an enhancer is found downstream of each
C gene. However, the resemblance to the Bovidae
genomic organisation is only apparent because in PipMaker dotplot matrices obtained by comparison of each
sheep TRG locus with the murine TRG1 cassette, only
short similarity traits corresponding to exonic regions are
evident. In the three gray rectangles in particular, three
spots are indicated, which correspond to the J gene and to
the first and last exon of the constant genes, respectively
(See Additional file 9, Figure S9a). The murine TRGV7
gene recognizes all the V genes of TRGC3 and TRGC4 cassettes (blue circles). On the other hand, the murine
TRGV4 is recognized by TRGV3-1, TRGV3-2 and TRGV7
while murine TRGV6 and TRGV5 are recognized by
TRGV10-1 and TRGV4, respectively (red rectangle). As
regards the matrix obtained by comparison of the ovine
TRG2 locus vs. the murine TRG1 cassette, only murine
TRGV7 recognizes TRGV5-1 and TRGV5-2, respectively
(See Additional file 9, Figure S9b). The similarity relationship between V genes in a three species comparison (not
shown) highlights the absence in the murine locus of the
TRGVA and TRGV9 human genes and the ovine TRGV6-1
and TRGV11-1 genes, and the absence of ovine TRGV101 and TRGV4 and murine TRGV6 and TRGV5 genes in the
human locus. The human/murine/Bovidae comparison
revealed that the V genes in the TRGC5 cassette are highly
related across species and lie in a syntenic region, indicating that this cassette existed before the primate – rodent –
artiodactyl lineages diverged.

Conclusion
The main objective of this study was to focus on the evolutionary history of the two TRG loci in Bovidae (cattle
and sheep) as compared to the single human locus. The
contiguous genomic sequence has allowed us to define
the genomic structure of the sheep TRG1 and TRG2 loci

Page 15 of 19

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:81

that emphasises the peculiarity of the organization of the
Bovidae loci in cassettes, each containing the basic V-J-J-C
unit; on the other hand, the human TRG locus features
duplicated J-C genes separated from the set of V genes
[18]. The analysis of the dot plot similarity matrix comparing the two sheep loci allowed us to propose an evolutionary model explaining the origin of two paralogous
regions in chromosome 4 of Bovidae. Evidence from concordant insertions of repetitive elements strongly supports
the interaction of the J-J-C regions in driving the sequence
of duplicative events. J-J-C regions are delimited at their 5'
end by promoters for germline transcription containing
STAT motifs, which control the local recombinational
accessibility [31] and at their 3' end by enhancer-like elements, which govern the general recombinational accessibility. The phylogenetic conservation of the eight
enhancer-like elements found in sheep compared with the
single copy present in the human indicates that they play
a key role in the functional organization of the Bovidae
TRG loci. Our proposed model suggests that only duplicated entire J-J-C regions, which possessed an enhancerlike element at their 3' end, and at least one variable gene
at their 5' end, were selected and fixed as functional cassettes. Requirements related to immunoprotective functions, which include mechanisms establishing a first
defensive barrier in the digestive tract of ruminant animals, are likely to have induced a sort of genomic fluidity
of this region favouring its evolution by reiterated duplications. Interspecies comparison of TRG loci reveals that
Bovidae and human loci, although apparently not correlated in general structure, share extensive colinearity and
high similarity levels in the regulatory and intergenic as
well as in the coding regions. On the other hand, Bovidae
and murine TRG loci, although almost identical in
genomic structure, show significant similarity only in the
genic sequences. Studies in other ruminant families will
be needed to further clarify evolutionary events and
answer questions regarding how genetic fluidity is generated in genomic loci determining "γδ high" condition. We
suggest that an extended phylogenetic analysis comparing
ovine-bovine sequences with other bovid species might
provide further insight into the evolutionary history of the
TRG locus in artiodactyls and mammals in general, and
provide some clues to support functional studies through
phylogenetic footprinting.

di Puglia" breed. A detailed list of these subclones is provided (See Additional file 10, Tables 10Sa, b).
Bovine TRG1 and TRG2 sequences were retrieved from the
accession numbers [GenBank: AY644517], [NW_937068]
and [GenBank: AY644518], respectively.
Human TRG sequence: position 1–140728 of the Genposition
Bank
entry
[GenBank:
NG_001336];
140729–141380 of the GenBank entry [GenBank:
AC006033] (Complement 53466–54680).
Murine TRGC1 correspond to position 1–50000 of the
GenBank entry [GenBank: AF037352].
Bioinformatic analyses
For the detection of repeats, the Tandem Repeats Finder
[36,37] and RepeatMasker [38] programs were used. TRF
locates and displays tandem repeats in DNA sequences
with pattern size in the range from 1 to 2000 bases.
RepeatMasker screens DNA sequences for interspersed
repeats and low complexity DNA sequences. The RepeatMasker analysis has been carried out using the Cetartiodactyla Repbase division section.
Multialignment of genomic contigs
For the comparative analyses of genomic sequences two
bioinformatic tools were used: PipMaker and mVISTA.
PipMaker [39,40] computes alignments of similar regions
in two DNA sequences. The resulting alignments are summarized with a "percent identity plot", or "pip", a dotplot
matrix, a report of the relevant annotation for the occurrence of genes, interspersed repeats and CpG islands. The
comparative analysis of genomic sequences providing
peak and valley conservation plot has been obtained
using mVISTA [41]. The extension of each analysed TRGJ
blocks was established in an approximative manner on
the basis of the conserved regions identified by the PipMaker program and shown in the corresponding dotplots.
More precisely they were on TRG1 contig: 35401–45351
(TRGJ5 block), 107201–115947 (TRGJ3 block),
136701–145807 (TRGJ4 block); on TRG2 contig:
10401–18840 (TRGJ1 block), 38901–47879 (TRGJ2
block), 68401–76429 (TRGJ6 block).
Construction of the enhancer-like sequences phylogram
tree
The phylogenetic tree has been constructed on 506
ungapped sites of the enhancer alignment by using the
PAUP* software with the Neighbor Joining method on
GTR distances. The ovine sequences identical to the one
(position 140573–141360 of the contig [GenBank:
NG_001336] [GenBank: AC006033]) containing the
human TRG locus enhancer (located downstream of C2
gene), in particular: positions 89–852 (5'TRGV5-1),

28460–29461
(3'C1),
59712–60714
(3'C2),
92330–93111 (3'C6) of the TRG2 contig; and positions
56800–57555 (3'C5), 78380–79154 (5'TRGV2-1),
97280–98048 (5'TRGV9-1), 124645–125360 (3'C3) of
the TRG1 contig were multialigned. The identity at 3'C4
gene (ovine TRG1 locus) was not included in the multialignment because of the partial relevant genomic
sequence.
