Schmidtea mediterranea phylogeography: an old
species surviving on a few Mediterranean islands?

Abstract
Background: Schmidtea mediterranea (Platyhelminthes, Tricladida, Continenticola) is found in scattered localities on
a few islands and in coastal areas of the western Mediterranean. Although S. mediterranea is the object of many
regeneration studies, little is known about its evolutionary history. Its present distribution has been proposed to
stem from the fragmentation and migration of the Corsica-Sardinia microplate during the formation of the western
Mediterranean basin, which implies an ancient origin for the species. To test this hypothesis, we obtained a large
number of samples from across its distribution area. Using known and new molecular markers and, for the first
time in planarians, a molecular clock, we analysed the genetic variability and demographic parameters within the
species and between its sexual and asexual populations to estimate when they diverged.
Results: A total of 2 kb from three markers (COI, CYB and a nuclear intron N13) was amplified from ~200
specimens. Molecular data clustered the studied populations into three groups that correspond to the west, central
and southeastern geographical locations of the current distribution of S. mediterranea. Mitochondrial genes show
low haplotype and nucleotide diversity within populations but demonstrate higher values when all individuals are
considered. The nuclear marker shows higher values of genetic diversity than the mitochondrial genes at the
population level, but asexual populations present lower variability than the sexual ones. Neutrality tests are
significant for some populations. Phylogenetic and dating analyses show the three groups to be monophyletic,
with the west group being the basal group. The time when the diversification of the species occurred is between
~20 and ~4 mya, although the asexual nature of the western populations could have affected the dating analyses.
Conclusions: S. mediterranea is an old species that is sparsely distributed in a harsh habitat, which is probably the
consequence of the migration of the Corsica-Sardinia block. This species probably adapted to temperate climates
in the middle of a changing Mediterranean climate that eventually became dry and hot. These data also suggest
that in the mainland localities of Europe and Africa, sexual individuals of S. mediterranea are being replaced by
asexual individuals that are either conspecific or are from other species that are better adapted to the
Mediterranean climate.

Background
Schmidtea mediterranea Benazzi et al., 1975 is a freshwater planarian (order Tricladida, suborder Continenticola, phylum Platyhelminthes) that is mostly known to
the scientific community for its capacity to regenerate
([1-3]) and has become a model organism for the functional analysis of the genes involved in pattern formation (e.g., [4]). Nonetheless, little is known about its
evolutionary history and demographics, although it

possesses several intriguing features. The genus Schmidtea includes only four species: S. polychroa, S. lugubris,
S. mediterranea and S. nova. With the exception of S.
polychroa, which has either amphimictic diploid and/or
parthenogenetic polyploid populations, most of the
Schmidtea species are amphimictic diploids. In S. mediterranea, in addition to the more common sexual
amphimictic diploids, a third type of reproduction, asexual fissiparity [5], occurs in diploid populations bearing
a heteromorphic translocation between 1st and 3rd chromosomes (only one chromosome of each pair is affected
by the translocation) [6-8]. Although fissiparity is also
common in other genera of planarians, such as Girardia

[9] and Dugesia [10], most asexual fissiparous populations of these genera are triploid.
S. mediterranea is restricted to the western Mediterranean in several scattered populations along the Catalan
coast, Menorca, Mallorca, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily and
Tunisia [6-8,11,12] (Figure 1). The asexual strain occurs
only in a few locations, in Catalonia and the Balearic
Islands, where sexual populations have not yet been
found. In the remaining distribution area, only sexual
diploids are found, with the only exceptions being a triploid sexual population in Sardinia [13] and a triploid
asexual (fissiparous) population in Menorca, the latter
bearing a translocation between the 1st and 3rd chromosomes (only one of each triplet) [7].
This peculiar geographical distribution prompted
Baguñà et al. [14] and De Vries et al. [11] to propose,
according to the known geological history of the area at
the time, that this was the result of microplate

fragmentation and migration during the formation of
the western Mediterranean basin. Indeed, the fragmentation of continental microplates (the Corsica-Sardinia
block, CSb) and their clockwise and counterclockwise
migration gave rise, during the Oligocene and early
Miocene periods, to the Balearic Islands, Corsica, Sardinia, Calabria and the Kabilies in Algeria [15-18]. If this
hypothesis is true, it implies that this species, or a close
ancestor, was already present on the microplate before
it first broke away, approximately 30 mya, splitting the
CSb from the Spanish coast. The poor dispersion capability of freshwater planarians (they require permanent
freshwater courses or ponds, and no forms resistant to
desiccation have been described) and their impossibility
to cross large marine masses, make other explanations
(e.g., human or animal transport or recent colonisation)
less plausible. Although a clear link between CSb fragmentation and migration and the successive speciation
events has been demonstrated for other groups of animals [19-21], the case of S. mediterranea is unique
because a correlation between geological events and its
distribution has not been linked to any speciation event,
which implies a more ancient origin for S. mediterranea.
Furthermore, when and how the asexual populations
of S. mediterranea originated is also of considerable
interest because no conspecific sexual individuals live in
the same localities, the nearest populations being found
in Sardinia and Corsica. This situation suggests multiple
possible explanations for when and where they originated. Asexual S. mediterranea could have originated
from Sardinian sexual populations a long time ago and
remained isolated in the current area of distribution;
they could have originated recently and have been transported by humans; or they could have a recent or
ancient origin from sexual Spanish populations that are
now extinct. Altogether, these ideas pose several interesting questions: 1) Is the microplate fragmentation the
origin of the present distribution of S. mediterranea? 2)
What is the age of this species? 3) When and where did
the asexual strain appear? 4) Which sexual population is
closest to the asexual ones? 5) Did the new asexual
populations outcompete the original sexual populations,
or did they originate in other regions and were brought
to their current localities by human transport?
To answer these questions and to widen our knowledge on the evolutionary history of S. mediterranea, a
well-resolved phylogeny is first needed. Molecular phylogenies are currently the best option to provide solid
evidence on the origin, relationships and divergence in
time among populations, particularly for organisms such
as planarians, which are lacking reliable morphological
characteristics. Furthermore, if these events can be correlated to some geological phenomena, a molecular
clock can be set and calibrated, and the evolutionary

history can be put into a temporal context. Finally, a
comparative analysis of the genetic (nucleotide) variability within and among populations may allow us to identify the evolutionary factors responsible for the levels
and patterns of genetic variation and therefore for the
biological diversity [22].
We have sequenced fragments of two mitochondrial
genes (one for the first time in planarians), and taking
into account the genomic information available for S.
mediterranea, we developed a new nuclear marker for
planarians. Because nuclear and mitochondrial markers
accumulate changes at different rates, they provide complementary information on the effects of different types
of factors, namely, those affecting different historical
times. Using these markers, we measured the levels of
genetic variation among and within all populations
sampled and inferred the phylogenetic tree for these
species. In addition, we have calibrated, for the first
time in planarians, a molecular clock to estimate the age
of the species and the divergence among populations.
The results obtained show the usefulness of the new
markers and attest that the phylogeography and evolutionary history of S. mediterranea is far more complex
than formerly envisaged.

Methods
Sampling, DNA extraction, gene amplification and
sequencing

Samples covering all known distributions of S. mediterranea (Table 1) were collected between 2006 and 2009.
Described populations from Mallorca [23] and north of
Catalonia [7] could not be recovered. Sampling in Morocco and Algeria retrieved a population of S. polychroa,
but no S. mediterranea was found. The populations
from Spain, Corsica and Tunisia are the only populations described in the literature for those regions and
were found during the present project sampling; no new

populations have been found. Populations collected
from Tunisia, Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily were identified
as S. mediterranea by karyological analyses using standard procedures [24]. Altogether, a total of 217 specimens were collected from 11 localities. High molecular
weight DNA was purified from live or ethanol-fixed specimens individually using DNAzol reagent (Molecular
Research Center Inc, Cincinnati, OH). Specific primers
(Table 2), some designed for this study, were used to
amplify partial fragments of the mitochondrial genes
cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and cytochrome b (CYB). We
also searched for new nuclear markers, and based on
sequences provided to us by other researchers (Abril, J.,
Adell, T. and Cebrià, F.), we designed primers to amplify
and perform sequence analyses of different introns from
the genes glycogen synthase kinase 3 and the netrin
receptor-like protein (netR). The intron of the glycogen
synthase kinase 3 gene was very short (~ 50 bp) and
showed low variability; thus, only a partial region of the
13th intron of the netrin receptor-like protein gene (N13)
was selected because it is the only fragment with the
length and variability adequate for the proposed studies.
Amplification products were sequenced directly with the
same primers used in the PCR reaction using Big Dye
(3.1, Applied Biosystems, Norwalk, CT, USA) and an
automated sequencer, ABI Prism 3730 Applied Biosystems/Hitachi (Unitat de Genòmica dels Serveis Científico-Tècnics de la UB). DNA sequences were aligned
with ClustalW [25] and optimised by sight using the
amino acidic sequence as a guide for mitochondrial
genes.
Cloning

Some individuals were heterozygous for the nuclear
gene N13 (Table 3). The haplotype phases were reconstructed using the PHASE algorithm [26,27] included in
DnaSP v5 [28]. The PCR products of six individuals,

diversity for N13 was calculated by using the H D formula [29] and replacing haplotypes with genotypes. The
COI, CYB and N13 haplotype networks were constructed using TCS v1.21 [30]. We used Spatial Analysis
of Molecular Variance (SAMOVA v1.0 [31]) to define
groups of populations, and we tested every gene for 2, 3
and 4 groups. This method is based on a simulated
annealing procedure aimed at identifying groups of
populations that are geographically homogeneous and
maximally differentiated in terms of an among-group
component of the overall genetic variance without the
prior assumption of group composition that is necessary
for AMOVA. The levels of divergence between S. polychroa and S. mediterranea and within and between the

new groups were estimated using the D xy parameter
[29]. The non-coding region of N13 presented high
sequence variability between S. polychroa and S. mediterranea, so only a fragment of 191 bp could be unambiguously aligned to calculate the divergence (K)
between the two species. Gene flow statistics FST and
the corresponding Nm were estimated for the three
regions defined by SAMOVA. A genetic differentiation
statistic, S nn , was estimated, and its statistical significance was determined using a permutation test (10,000
replicates). To determine if the pattern of the polymorphism for the N13 fragment conforms to that
expected under the neutral hypothesis, we applied two
neutrality tests to detect the specific fingerprint of
recent population expansions, heavy bottlenecks or
other selective and demographic scenarios: Tajima’s D
[32] and R2 [33]. These statistics were selected because
they are not sensitive to the haplotype phase reconstruction and R2 has the advantage of behaving well for small
sample sizes. Their statistical significance was estimated
using coalescent computer simulations (10,000
replicates).
Phylogeny and the molecular clock

All maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analyses
were determined using PHYML 3.0 [34] with the HKY
model and 1000 bootstrap replicates. Bayesian inference
(BI) was estimated using either with MrBayes 3.1 [35,36]
or BEAST 1.6.1 [37].
Because the fossil record of freshwater planarians is
non-existent, no molecular clock for the Tricladida is
available. Hence, to calibrate the molecular clock and to
infer the approximate age of Schmidtea mediterranea,
we used two-step dating. First, an analysis with a partial
sequence of the COI gene (309 bp), which belongs to 19
species of the families Dugesiidae and Planariidae (Additional file 1), was performed. Before running the dating
analysis, we ran phylogenetic analyses for the short COI
fragment using ML and BI (MrBayes, GTR with
InvGamma, 10 6 generations with sampling every 10 3
and a burnin value of 10%) to test its resolution capability from the family to the species level. Then, we used
BEAST with the following conditions: relaxed clock estimate, HKY evolutionary model and Yule process speciation, during 107 generations with sampling parameters
every 103 and a 10% burnin value for the final trees, as
recommended in the BEAST manual. We calibrated the
data based on the biogeographical hypothesis proposed
by Ball (1974) [38]. Analysing the present day distribution of the Dugesidae genera, Ball suggested that the
center of the origin of this family would have been situated in southern Gondwanaland. The breakage of this
supercontinent, thus separating from what would
become America to the west, would have resulted in the

Page 5 of 15

origin of the Girardia genus (exclusively American) in
that region, while the rest of the genera (or their ancestors) would have appeared in the eastern block; Dugesia
and Schmidtea (currently present in Africa, Asia and
Europe) would have originated in Africa and Europe,
respectively, after their ancestors moved northward.
Hence, we have used the split between the continents of
Africa and South America (ending around 100 mya) as
a calibration point to determine the maximum age of
the separation of the genera Dugesia and Schmidtea
from the genus Girardia.
In the second dating step, we used 192 sequences
from the COI (920 bp) and CYB (677 bp) genes of S.
mediterranea and the mean rate value obtained for
COI in the previous analysis to determine the age of
separation between the populations of S. mediterranea.
For this second analysis, which consisted of a comparison of populations from the same species, it was
expected that the rates of evolution would not vary
among populations. Hence, the conditions for the analysis were the following: strict clock, HKY evolutionary
model, coalescent model with constant population size
for 10 8 generations, sampling every 10 4 generations
and a burnin of 10%. In addition, a phylogenetic analysis with ML was performed to obtain boostrap support
for the nodes.

Results
Datasets

For the COI and CYB sequences, we created two datasets for each gene: one for phylogenetic analyses and the
other for population genetic studies. For phylogenetic
analyses, the COI alignment contained 216 sequences of
920 bp. CYB was more difficult to amplify, so the dataset contained only 193 sequences of 677 bp. However,
the ends of some sequences, for both COI and CYB,
were shorter because of sequencing difficulties and contained a series of Ns. Additionally, some COI gene
sequences were amplified in two non-overlapping fragments, and this procedure resulted in a short region
between them (~50 bp) in which some individuals had
unknown nucleotides. In both cases, these sites were
removed from the datasets for the rest of analyses. This
removal reduced the length of the COI dataset to 699
bp and of the CYB dataset to 598 bp. The nuclear fragment (N13, a non-coding region) was used in population
genetic analyses but not in phylogenetic inference analyses because its levels of polymorphism were high
within the populations studied but low among them
and, consequently, there was not enough information
for the analyses at this level. Additionally, there were
difficulties with amplification of N13 in some individuals
and, hence, a single dataset was obtained with 177
sequences of 336 bp.

(Figure 2C). However, after using SAMOVA (Additional file 3) for N13, we found three groups of populations with the same clustering as was found for the
mitochondrial genes (Figure 1C). Accordingly, the
groups obtained were named WEST (W, populations
from Barcelona and Menorca), CENTRAL (C, populations from Sardinia and Corsica) and SOUTHEAST (S,
populations from Sicily and Tunis). When these groups
were analysed using the S nn statistical test, they were
found to be significantly different. Moreover, the FST
statistic was high, and the values for Nm were very
low for the three genes (Table 4).
For the mitochondrial genes (Table 3), the groups presented low nucleotide diversity (π) with the sole exception of CYB from the S group. In some cases (S group
COI, W and S CYB), the values of mitochondrial haplotype diversity (H D ) for the groups were higher than
those observed for the individual populations within
them, which is indicative of differentiation among their
populations. The values of nucleotide and haplotype
diversity for N13 were, in general, higher than those for
the mitochondrial genes.
The average number of nucleotide substitutions per
site (K) between S. polychroa and S. mediterranea were
similar for the three genes (15% for COI, 17% for CYB
and 14% for N13; Table 5). For mitochondrial genes,
Dxy values between populations and within each group
(W, C and S) were much lower (at least four times
lower) than among groups (Table 5). The highest Dxy
values among groups were situated at approximately
3.5%, demonstrating a large gap between the higher
intraspecific distances and the mean interspecific values
(15-17%). For N13, this gap was more evident because
the higher interpopulation distances were 1.4%.

All nucleotide polymorphism results are shown in Table
3. We found 8 haplotypes in the 216 COI sequences
analysed [GenBank: JF837055 to JF837062] and 10 haplotypes in the 193 CYB sequences [GenBank: JF837045
to JF837054]. For both genes, a single haplotype was
found in 7 of the 11 populations studied. For N13, we
found only two populations with a single allele, TUN_LEB and SIC_MAR, because the remaining populations
had more than one allele and at least one heterozygous
individual [GenBank: JF837063 to JF837081]. We used
the PHASE algorithm to reconstruct the alleles of N13
that were present in the heterozygous individuals in
these populations. PHASE results showed that the two
populations with more heterozygous individuals (BAR_MON and SIC_MAZ) shared an allele. Because these
two populations are geographically distant and differ in
the presence/absence of the translocation and in their
type of reproduction, we decided to clone the N13 PCR
product of some individuals of each population to verify
the existence of this common allele. The sequences
obtained (Additional file 2) showed that BAR_MON and
SIC_MAZ do not share any allele. The conflicting
results between the PHASE outcome and the cloning
experiments were most likely derived from the assumption of PHASE in which all of the individuals analysed
belong to a single panmictic population in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, a situation that posterior analyses (see
below) showed not to be the case here. Finally, for the
177 individuals analysed, after phase reconstruction and
cloning verification, we found 14 alleles in the 354 N13
sequences.
Taking all of the populations together, the haplotype
diversity values were high and similar for the three
genes (0.773, 0.803 and 0.853), whereas nucleotide
diversity was much higher in the mitochondrial genes
(0.0223 and 0.0168) than for the nuclear marker
(0.0081). Instead, haplotype and nucleotide diversity
within the populations were lower for the mitochondrial
genes than for the nuclear fragment (Table 3).
The nuclear gene N13 showed very similar values of
haplotype and nucleotide diversity within the populations (Table 3), with the only exception being the two
Menorca asexual populations, which had nearly no
variability. Additionally, the genotypic variability was
also very low for the three asexual populations.
Geographical division and genetic differentiation among
and within geographical groups

show three well-differentiated groups that match the
current geographical distribution of populations (west,
central and southeast of the known distribution) (Figures 1A and 1B). The N13 network does not at first

Demography analysis and neutrality test

Neutrality tests, based on Tajima’s D, showed significant
positive values (Table 6) in four populations: BAR_MON
(W group) and in three populations of the C group
(SAR_VAL, SAR_SIL and COR_CAN), whereas the
SAR_CAR population was also very close to the right
95% confidence interval. Ramos-Onsins and Rozas’ R2
statistical test showed significant values for the same
populations and also for the single population in the S
group with more than one haplotype (SIC_MAZ). However, Menorcan populations (W group) showed negative,
although not significant, values for Tajima’s D.
Phylogeny and the molecular clock

To test the phylogenetic informativeness of the short
COI gene fragment before dating analysis, two phylogenetic analyses by ML and BI were performed. Both
resulting trees were concordant with the accepted

with a geologically based biogeographical hypothesis
[41,42]. Finally, the average rate of evolution calculated
for the COI gene by BEAST for the whole tree is 0.0027

per million years), which implies a sequence divergence
of 0.54% per million years. This is between one-half and

as a standard for mitochondrial genes (mainly derived
from arthropods [43]) in many studies. However, similar
low values have been found in other groups, e.g., 0.670.95% sequence divergence in molluscs of the Arcidae
family [44]. While planarians have some of the lowest

rates of substitution, this does not invalidate the dating
results obtained.
Using the mean rate obtained in the previous analysis
(0.0027), we performed the second dating analysis with
the two mitochondrial genes. The analysis included all
individuals for which we obtained sequences of both
mitochondrial genes. The topology of the resulting tree
within S. mediterranea was the same as that obtained in
the previous analysis, and node ages and dating intervals
between the three groups were consistent in both analyses (Figure 3 and Additional file 4). W, C and S groups
were monophyletic with high posterior probabilities in
the Bayesian analysis, and western populations appeared
to be the basal group of the three groups. The populations within the regions did not constitute monophyletic
groups, with two exceptions: the individuals from
TUN_LEB (brown in Figure 3) constitute a monophyletic clade (1 PP/79 BS) buried within the S group, and
this clade is a sister clade to some individuals from
SIC_MAZ; and the individuals from MEN_MER (orange
in Figure 3) also constitute a monophyletic clade (1 PP/
65 BS) that is a sister clade to a clade that includes a
mix of individuals from the other two populations of
the W group.

Discussion
Is Schmidtea mediterranea a single species?

The levels of genetic divergence found among all of the
populations of S. mediterranea studied, which cover
most of its current range of distribution, suggest that it
is a single species. This suggestion is based on the large
gap between the higher genetic distance values obtained
among S. mediterranea populations and those between
the S. mediterranea populations and S. polychroa (values
of 0.035 for COI, 0.028 for CYB and 0.014 for N13 vs.
the means of 0.15, 0.17 and 0.14, respectively). Furthermore, these values are within the range for other Tricladida species. In Dugesia and Microplana (a freshwater
and a terrestrial genus, respectively), the COI divergence
within species is less than 0.04, whereas among species
it is greater than 0.10-0.12 [10,45]. Such differences are
clearly visualised in the first phylogenetic dating analysis,
which includes the other three Schmidtea species (Additional file 4).
S. mediterranea is genetically structured. This is evident for the mitochondrial genes and, although not as
clearly, for the nuclear intron as well. The haplotype
networks for both mitochondrial genes show three
well-defined groups that are separated by a similar
number of differences, and these groups correspond to
the same three clades separated by deep nodes in the
phylogenetic analyses (Figures 2 and 3 and Additional
file 3). The structure shown by the haplotype networks
and phylogenetic trees is confirmed by the SAMOVA

results, which show that the same three groups are the
ones that best explain the genetic structure in relation
to geographical distribution, in this case, for the three
markers (Additional file 3). Additionally, genetic differentiation analyses (Table 4) show that the three groups
are significantly differentiated both for the mitochondrial and nuclear genes (high FST values and a significant S nn value). The differences in genetic diversity
patterns found between nuclear and mitochondrial
markers generally result from differences in coalescence times between the two genomes. The fact that
in certain analyses the nuclear marker also detects the
division into three groups supports the idea that this
might be the result of an old isolation; together with
the observed lack of gene flow among populations, this
finding could indicate that these groups are undergoing speciation or even constitute cryptic species
(although the reported inter-fertility among C and S
individuals [46] makes this latter hypothesis less
plausible).

The geographical distribution of Schmidtea mediterranea:
remnant of an old distribution driven by microplate
dispersal or indicator of recent colonisations?

The genetic structure found for S. mediterranea does
not reflect a process of recent colonisation from one
region to the others. Indeed, the genetic pattern found
– with significant differentiation among geographical
groups and even among populations within each group
(polymorphism parameters show low levels of polymorphism within populations but high levels when all
populations are considered together for mitochondrial
genes, which reflects high differentiation among the
populations) –indicates better an ancient differentiation
among these three geographical groups and even within
them. Moreover, the shape of the haplotype networks,
which shows the groups to be equidistant, suggests that
no region is central to the others. Altogether, these findings strongly suggest that the current distribution of S.
mediterranea is a relic of the split from a former larger
geographical distribution.

Lázaro et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:274
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/274

Taking into account the phylogeny of S. mediterranea,
could the fragmentation and migration of microplates
be the sole reason for its current distribution? Despite
the evident complexities of the geology of the western
Mediterranean [16,17,47], there is a general agreement
on the original location of the microplates of Corsica,
Sardinia, part of Calabria, the Balearic Islands and both
Kabylies (Grande and Petite), which form the CSb, the
region that separated from Iberia and Eurasia 30 mya.
In the first event, the southern assemblage, which
included the Balearic Islands and the Grande Kabylie,
broke off and moved clockwise from Iberia, and the
northern assemblage, which included Corsica, Sardinia,
part of Calabria and the Petite Kabylie, broke off and
moved counter clockwise from Eurasia. Next, the crucial
event was the breakage between both assemblages that
gave rise to the Sardinian Channel at 24 mya, dividing
the western from the central and southern areas.
Between 16 mya and 10 mya, Corsica and Sardinia
reached their present locations and collided with future
peninsular Italy (then connected with Sicily). Finally, the
Tyrrhenian Sea opened between 8.6 mya and 7.6 mya
[47]. In parallel, the Grande and Petite Kabylies broke
off from the Balearic Island and Sardinia microplates,
respectively, between 25 mya and 20 mya, moved southwards and collided with Africa to reach their final positions approximately 15 mya. Furthermore, the history of
the islands, such as the Balearic Islands and Sicily, is
even more complex because in the last 20 my, they have
endured periods of submersion and emersion, as well as
continental contacts. Thus, ~14.8 mya, as attested by
the entrance of diverse animal species, Menorca and
Mallorca were in contact with the Iberian Peninsula.
Later, a marine transgression covered both islands, wiping out most of the Protoligurian fauna and flora, only
sparing some species in the highest parts of Mallorca
(Serra de Tramuntana). A second contact with the
peninsula, approximately 5 mya (during the Messinian
crisis, when the sea level dropped dramatically), allowed
the entrance of some mammal species. Finally, during
the Pleistocene glaciations, the two islands formed a single landmass, easing the migration of the remaining Protoligurian and other fauna from Mallorca to Menorca
[48,49].
The first dating analysis (Additional file 4) provides an
age of ~43 mya for the divergence of S. mediterranea
from its sister species Schmidtea polychroa. This date
and the age inferred for the older node of S. mediterranea in our two dating analyses (between ~20 and ~5
mya; Figure 3, Additional file 4) sets a time range for
the origin of the species that is congruent with the
hypothesis that S. mediterranea, or its most recent
ancestor, was already present on the CSb microplate (or
microplates [18]) when the microplate broke off from

Page 10 of 15

the continent ~30 mya. Furthermore, the basal position
of the W group (Spanish populations) is consistent with
the next breakage of the CSb into the northern and
southern microplate assemblages. Finally, the splitting of
Corsica and Sardinia from Calabria during the opening
of the Tyrrhenian Sea (7.6-8.6 mya) and the connection
of the latter, via Sicily, with Tunisia would have resulted
in the separation of the C and S groups (~7 my of age
for the last common ancestor). The spreading of the
groups from Calabria to Sicily and Tunisia was likely
very hazardous given its low dispersal capability, but it
happened during a rainier period than today. Indeed,
the Mediterranean climate as we know it, with dry summers, did not appear until 3.2 mya [50] with the main
difference being the frequency of rain, rather than the
temperature, which should have resulted in more freshwater courses and, hence, more opportunities for freshwater planarians to disperse. Last but not least, with the
present data, we can also postulate that the present
asexual populations (W group) are descendants of the
original sexual S. mediterranea that remained on the
continent or in the Balearic Islands after Sardinia and
Corsica broke away, although the dating obtained is too
recent to be explained by the geological history
(between ~20 and ~4 mya vs. 24 mya). Alternatively,
this age could be consistent with a variation of the CSb
migration hypothesis [51] in which the microplate
including Corsica-Sardinia and Calabria remained connected to the Paleo-Europe continent during its migration, becoming detached ~5 mya, when the
Mediterranean was refilled after the Messinian salinity
crisis and simultaneously with the raising of Tuscany.
This alternative could explain the closeness of the split
between the three geographical groups in our phylogenetic trees and their equidistance in haplotype networks.
However, in this case, we would expect S. mediterranea
to be distributed across a wider area, including Liguria
and the Mediterranean coast of France, but S. mediterranea has never been described in these places or been
found there in recent samplings, whereas S. polychroa
and other planarian species have. One can consider that
the asexual character of the W group populations could
have affected the dating analyses, resulting in artefactually younger datings (see the next section).
Compared to its sister genus Dugesia (with more than
20 species described in the Mediterranean), the genus
Schmidtea (with a mere 4 species) has a much lower
diversity (see Additional file 4). Even in the area where
we find S. mediterranea, Dugesia has diversified into at
least 4 species (D. hepta, D. benazzii, D. subtentaculata,
and D. liguriensis) probably as a consequence of the
same geological events described here. Therefore, the
results point to Schmidtea as a low diversifying genus
and to S. mediterranea as an old species compared to

Lázaro et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:274
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/274

others in the same area, even within the Tricladida.
With the exception of S. mediterranea and some populations of S. polychroa in North Africa and Sardinia,
most Schmidtea inhabit continental Europe up to Scotland and Sweden. Sexual S. polychroa and S. lugubris lay
cocoons between 10°C and 23-25 °C [52] because higher
temperatures are deleterious. Even for sexual populations of S. mediterranea, Harrath et al. [12] showed a
moderate to drastic reduction in the size of the testes,
ovaries and the copulatory apparatus begins at over 20 °
C and worsens over 25 °C. In other words, Schmidtea
seem best adapted to climates with moderate summer
temperatures, a situation that is by no means found on
the Mediterranean islands and in continental coastal
areas. This raises a final intriguing question: could S.
mediterranea be considered a survivor trapped in a
harsh habitat as a consequence of CSb breakage and
migration?
The asexual populations of S. mediterranea: Single or
recurrent origins? Recent or ancient?

Genetic variability at the mitochondrial level is null
within asexual populations and very low when the three
populations are taken together (only for CYB did one of
the three populations show a different haplotype diverging only at one nucleotide). In contrast, the nuclear
marker N13 shows, namely, in the Barcelona population,
high haplotype diversity similar to that found for sexual
populations in other regions. This value might, however,
be rather misleading because the Barcelona population
is almost exclusively made up of heterozygous individuals (32 out of 33). When we measure genotype diversity instead of haplotype diversity (Table 3) all asexual
populations show lower genetic variabilities than the
sexual populations. In summary, whereas in sexual
populations the variability is evenly distributed among
all genotypes (whether heterozygous or homozygous), in
asexual populations variability is exclusively found in
specific genotypes. Although the latter situation would
be at odds with a panmictic population, it might be
anticipated for an asexual population that reproduces by
fission.
How is the very low or null variability in asexual fissiparous S. mediterranea explained? Most likely, when a
few individuals, or even one, became asexual within a
sexual population (assuming that they persisted and outcompeted their sexual counterparts), this genotype
would become fixed, which would result in the disappearance of the sexual individuals and of most genetic
variability. Present climatic conditions and the types of
habitat where these asexual forms are found make this
scenario very likely. In Menorca, the asexual forms live
in temporary water courses that become dry or are
reduced to small ponds during summer, with running

Page 11 of 15

water only after rainfall in winter and early spring.
Under these conditions and with a fair amount of food
available, fissiparous organisms (which duplicate in
number after fission and regeneration in 15- 20 days)
could reproduce faster than sexual individuals, which
have higher energy demands than asexual individuals
because they need to develop and maintain reproductive
organs, mate, and lay cocoons [53]. In fact, the negative
values obtained in the Tajima’s D neutrality test,
although not significant, provide support for an expansion signal for the two Menorca populations. For the
Barcelona population, the situation is different because
it is localised in a plant nursery without seasonal water
shortages. However, other factors, such as periodic pond
cleaning in the plant nursery, may cause some decreases
in population size. The significant positive values
obtained in the neutrality tests may result from these
types of recent and less pronounced bottleneck.
It is important to bear in mind that asexual reproduction by fissiparity poses problems that are very different
from the much more common asexual reproduction by
parthenogenesis. In parthenogenetic populations, new
genetic variants could arise and spread by mutation in
the germline, and with the occurrence of meiosis, new
combinations could arise by recombination. In fissiparous populations, all mutations are somatic instead, and
the probability of a new mutation spreading over a
whole individual, and thereafter through the whole
population, should be very low and could explain the
extremely low rates of substitutions in these populations. Therefore, the genetic composition found in these
organisms might be a frozen picture of the genetic pattern that was present in the first animals that became
asexual. Although very low rates of substitution (absence
of nucleotide diversity) are evident in the data presented
here, more in depth studies with new markers are
necessary to understand how these populations keep the
burdens of a lack of genetic variability at bay.
From the data obtained, is it possible to make an educated guess about when and where asexual populations
originated and spread? The close genetic relationship
among the Menorca and Barcelona populations, the
sharing of mitochondrial haplotypes, and their geographical closeness argues for a single asexualisation event.
After the asexual individuals outcompete the original
sexual population, they might have spread from the
island to the continent or vice versa (the former is more
likely given the basal situation of MEN_MER in the W
clade) either by passive dispersal or through human
activities, that has been proven for several species, freshwater planarians among them (Ribas et al. [9] for Girardia tigrina; and Lázaro et al. [10] for Dugesia sicula).
However, although the estimated age for the clade,
including the BAR_MON and MEN_GOR individuals, is

Lázaro et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:274
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/274

too recent to be explained by the geological events
described, it is also too old to be explained by human
transport (0.6-0.2 mya). As for the age of onset of the
asexual lineage, it is recent according to the point of
diversification among fissiparous populations (1.36-0.14
mya).
However, this and the recent dating obtained for the
basal splitting in the species tree (Figure 3) might be
underestimates caused by the anomalously low genetic
substitution rates of fissiparous organisms misleading
the methodologies used in the dating analyses. To test
this hypothesis further, we performed a test and
attempted to model the change in the evolutionary rate
in the asexual lineage by using BEAST. To do this, we
repeated our second dating analysis, and this time we
considered the asexual sequences as fossils so that at
the point in the past where they first appear, the lineage
stops accumulating changes (Additional file 5). The
results show that, if we assign an old age to the asexuals
(around 20 mya) and use the rate obtained in our first
dating analysis, we recover splitting ages among geographical groups that are close to those that would be
expected if the CSb hypothesis were true. The low substitution rates of fissiparous populations could spare
them the burden of accumulating deleterious mutations
and explain this longevity, although they still need to
avoid the problem of a lack of variability. Further
genetic analyses, including more coding regions, could
help to ascertain whether these hypotheses are valid and
to understand how mutations spread within individuals
and became fixed in populations of these asexuals.
A final conundrum of the asexual populations of S.
mediterranea is the presence of the fissiparous triploid
population (MEN_MER) that bears the translocation in
one of its three chromosomal sets. In freshwater planarians, triploid individuals are known to form in sexually
reproducing populations (e.g., in S. polychroa [54,55])
from the union of unreduced diploid ovules (or sperm)
and haploid sperm (or ovules). The MEN_MER population bears two normal chromosomal sets with one set
including the translocation between the 1st and 3rd chromosomes. Therefore, this population could have originated from the union between an unreduced diploid
ovule from a sexual diploid and a sperm bearing the
chromosomal translocation from an asexual individual.
In laboratory cultures, large (e.g., >20-25 mm in length)
individuals from asexual fissiparous populations often
develop testes, large ovaries, and the whole copulatory
complex [6,56] and have been reported to mate with
sexual diploids, although the cocoons that are laid are
usually sterile. Although fissiparous specimens do not
usually reach this size in nature, such an event is the
more reasonable explanation for the origin of fissiparous
triploids in S. mediterranea.

The sexual populations of S. mediterranea

The sexual populations studied showed extremely low
mitochondrial variabilities (Table 3), with two of them
(one in Sardinia, one in Sicily) having no variability.
Data on intrapopulation variability for other triclads are
scarce, but two terrestrial planarian species from the
Atlantic forest in Brazil have notably higher values of π
(0.01 and 0.017 for COI [57]). Although other groups of
animals show very low values of π [e.g., Palinurus elephas (0.0013-0.0030 for COI, [58]); and the lepidopter
Helicoverpa armigera (0.0017-0.0038 for COI, [59])], the
values are not as low as those found for S. mediterranea.
For the nuclear marker, intrapopulation variability is
higher than for mitochondrial genes, although again two
populations (from Tunisia and Sicily) show no variability. However, as pointed out above, the high diversity
found among geographical regions, even for the nuclear
marker, suggests an old origin for the present distribution of planarians and, hence, for their populations.
Because old populations are expected to contain high
variability (because long stable populations accumulate
changes), the low levels determined here could be
explained by demographic events affecting neutrality.
The neutrality tests applied (Table 6) show that many of
these populations demonstrate a significant result
against the hypothesis of neutrality, with the estimated
values on the positive side of the interval obtained in
the permutation test. This finding may be interpreted as
a consequence of recent bottlenecks (that would also
explain the significant genetic differentiation found
among populations; data not shown). This interpretation
is in agreement with the habitat and climate conditions
in which these populations live, even though their
demographic conditions are not as harsh as those for
the fissiparous populations from Menorca, and the sexual character of the C and S populations results in a different outcome (here, there are no signs of population
expansion).
The relationship between Sicilian and Tunisian populations merits a final comment. The close relationship
between the Tunisian population and some individuals
from the Sicilian populations may indicate that the only
Tunisian population (despite extensive sampling [12,60])
was recently introduced by human activities. However,
this is unlikely because the Sicilian and Tunisian populations do not share a mitochondrial haplotype and
because the age of the node giving rise to the Tunisian
population (Figure 3) far exceeds the age in which
human activities began in the Mediterranean. Therefore,
the scarcity of S. mediterranea in Africa (it has so far
not been reported from Algeria to the Canary Islands)
may be explained by competition between the abundant
fissiparous triploids of D. sicula [60] and S. mediterranea. Fissiparous populations of D. sicula are present all

around the Mediterranean coastal areas (from Greece
and Israel to the Canary Islands [10]; E. Solà and M.
Riutort, unpublished data) where they seem well adapted
to high temperatures and dry conditions [60,61]. It is
not surprising that D. sicula may outcompete S. mediterranea, which at present has been reduced to a single
locality found in Tunisia, despite a reasonable sampling
coverage.

Conclusions
Schmidtea is a genus with a low diversity that is constituted by only four species. These species are probably
quite old (~40 mya) and primarily have a northern European distribution. They are probably better adapted to
cold climates, which are less likely to allow speciation,
than to hot climates. Ball [38] has suggested that
Schmidtea species are in morphological stasis (differences in morphology among species are circumscribed
to details of their reproductive organs), and the present
study seems to indicate that the stasis is also found at
the molecular level.
The present distribution of S. mediterranea is best
explained, as suggested long ago, by a vicariant process
of microplate fragmentation and migration of the CSb
during the Oligocene and Miocene periods. Regardless
of which of the two possible outcomes of this hypothesis
better explains the distribution of Schmidtea, the age of
the species is relatively old compared with the species of
other groups present in the same area, even compared
with its sister genus Dugesia. Asexual fissiparous populations of S. mediterranea probably arose within the
west area; however, the lack of sexual populations in
that area precludes a good estimate of whether it was an
ancient or a recent event. Last but not least, the sparse
number of localities where S. mediterranea is currently
present in the continental range, i.e., on the Tunisian
and the Catalan coast, suggests that S. mediterranea
may be a survivor trapped in a harsh habitat after a long
voyage to the South on several microplates after the
breakage of the CSb 30 mya from which S. mediterranea
has slowly been displaced by better-adapted species.
