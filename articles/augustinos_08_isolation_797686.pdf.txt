Abstract
Background: The Tephritidae family of insects includes the most important agricultural pests of fruits and vegetables,
belonging mainly to four genera (Bactrocera, Ceratitis, Anastrepha and Rhagoletis). The olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae, is the
major pest of the olive fruit. Currently, its control is based on chemical insecticides. Environmentally friendlier methods
have been attempted in the past (Sterile Insect Technique), albeit with limited success. This was mainly attributed to the
lack of knowledge on the insect's behaviour, ecology and genetic structure of natural populations. The development of
molecular markers could facilitate the access in the genome and contribute to the solution of the aforementioned
problems. We chose to focus on microsatellite markers due to their abundance in the genome, high degree of
polymorphism and easiness of isolation.
Results: Fifty-eight microsatellite-containing clones were isolated from the olive fly, Bactrocera oleae, bearing a total of
sixty-two discrete microsatellite motifs. Forty-two primer pairs were designed on the unique sequences flanking the
microsatellite motif and thirty-one of them amplified a PCR product of the expected size. The level of polymorphism was
evaluated against wild and laboratory flies and the majority of the markers (93.5%) proved highly polymorphic. Thirteen
of them presented a unique position on the olive fly polytene chromosomes by in situ hybridization, which can serve as
anchors to correlate future genetic and cytological maps of the species, as well as entry points to the genome. Crossspecies amplification of these markers to eleven Tephritidae species and sequencing of thirty-one of the amplified
products revealed a varying degree of conservation that declines outside the Bactrocera genus.
Conclusion: Microsatellite markers are very powerful tools for genetic and population analyses, particularly in species
deprived of any other means of genetic analysis. The presented set of microsatellite markers possesses all features that
would render them useful in such analyses. This could also prove helpful for species where SIT is a desired outcome,
since the development of effective SIT can be aided by detailed knowledge at the genetic and molecular level.
Furthermore, their presented efficacy in several other species of the Tephritidae family not only makes them useful for
their analysis but also provides tools for phylogenetic comparisons among them.

Background
The Tephritidae family of insects includes the most
important agricultural pests of fruits and vegetables. Most
of them belong to four genera: Bactrocera, Ceratitis, Anastrepha and Rhagoletis. Ceratitis includes 89 different species.
Among them, the Medfly, Ceratitis capitata, is the best so
far studied member of the family and attacks over 350 different fruits and vegetables in tropical and sub-tropical
regions [1], causing damages of hundreds of billions $ per
year. Anastrepha is the most economically important
genus of pests in the American tropics and subtropics and
includes more than fifteen economically important pests
[2]. Rhagoletis includes more than 60 described species
distributed in Eurasia and the New World, several of
which are important pests [3]. Bactrocera is among the
largest genera in Tephritidae including about 500 species
[4,5]. Many of them are serious pests of fruits and vegetables in different parts of the world [2]. The only member
of this genus present in Europe is the olive fruit fly, Bactrocera oleae, the major pest of the olive fruit, with estimated damages of 5–30% of the global olive production,
resulting in economic losses of about 800 million $ per
year [6,7]. Quarantine orders against non-indigenous
Tephritidae exist in all countries, demonstrating the
appreciation of these species' destructive abilities and
invasiveness success [8-12].
Currently, control of these insects is based on chemical
insecticides. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is the most
promising, environmentally friendly method, based on
the mass production and release of sterile insects into field
populations. When the released males mate with the field
females no progeny are produced and the field population may finally be suppressed. The appreciation of the
negative effect of the released females [13] lead to the
development of genetic sexing strains (GSS) [14]. Successful development of such approaches, however, presupposes an understanding of the species at the genetic,
molecular and population level. Additionally, new molecular and genetic tools, such as genetic transformation,
could prove very helpful since they can improve mass
rearing of effective male insects. Such knowledge developed in the Medfly lead to successful SIT protocols (for a
review, see [15]), whereas respective lack in the olive fly
lead to fruitless attempts. In the early '70s, efforts to
employ the SIT against the olive fly were unsuccessful
[16], principally due to the low competitiveness of the
sterile mass-reared males compared to the wild ones [17].
Several molecular and genetic studies have changed B.
oleae's research landscape in recent years. Among them we
mention studies on population genetics [18-20], cytogenetics (for a review see [21]), sex-determining cascades
[22,23] and, most notably, the successful genetic transformation [24], an achievement that gives new perspectives
towards the efficient use of the SIT.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/618

Microsatellites constitute very powerful genetic and
molecular markers [25-27]. In the Medfly they have been
used to identify sources of origin, invasion phenomena,
to design control strategies [28-31], as well as in the
genetic mapping of the species [32]. This last possibility
renders microsatellite markers particularly useful in the
olive fly, since several years of efforts have provided no
morphological markers and therefore the development of
classical genetics has been entirely hindered (Mavragani,
unpublished; Zacharopoulou, unpublished). In addition,
such markers can also be helpful in SIT development. For
example, they have been successfully used in the analysis
of mating systems in B. dorsalis [33] and C. capitata
[34,35] and they can be used to detect the degree of differentiation between laboratory and wild flies, the main reason of SIT failure in the olive fly.
The present study enriches a previously described set of 15
microsatellite markers [36,19] with 16 new ones. Most of
these markers were proven polymorphic, some of them
were localized in the polytene chromosomes of the species and many of them were successfully cross-amplified
in other Tephritidae species. Their utility in genetic studies
and evolutionary comparisons is considered.

Results and discussion
Isolation and characterization of microsatellites from
small-insert genomic libraries and enriched libraries
Thirty-four microsatellite containing clones were isolated
from small-insert genomic libraries and 24 from enriched
libraries, yielding a total of 36 and 26 discrete microsatellite motifs, respectively, since a few of them contained
more than one microsatellite motif (Table 1). Despite the
use of an equal mix of (GT)15 and (CT)15 as probes, there
was a clear predominance of GT over CT repeats obtained
from the small-insert library. This most likely reflects a difference in the abundance of these sequences in the
genome, as has been the case in other Diptera, such as D.
melanogaster [37-39], D. simulans [40], A. gambiae [41] and
C. capitata (Stratikopoulos et al., submitted) [28]. In
hymenoptera, CT repeats seem to be more abundant than
GT repeats, as studies in Apis mellifera and Bombus terrestris
reveal [42].

A significant predominance of interrupted (60.5%) over
perfect motifs (34.2%) was observed in both isolation
approaches, while only a few (5.2%) were compound.
These percentages are quite similar to those observed in C.
capitata [28] and B. terrestris [42]. On the other hand, they
are not in agreement with results from B. tryoni [43], B.
morii [44], D. pseudoobscura [45] and a recent study in C.
capitata (Stratikopoulos et al., submitted). Therefore, it is
unclear whether these results represent the actual structure
of microsatellites in the olive fly genome, since data from
closely related species are conflicting. Possibly these

In situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes
Cytological analysis of B. oleae has revealed five chromosomes (10 polytene arms) and a heterochromatic mass,
corresponding to the five autosomes and the sex chromosomes, respectively (for a review see [21]). Well-defined
polytene maps have been produced, providing the opportunity for a cytologic localization of molecular markers on
the chromosomes.

Twenty of the isolated microsatellite clones were in situ
hybridised to the salivary gland polytene chromosomes of
B. oleae, in order to identify their chromosomal localization. At hybridisation temperature of 58°C, sixteen of the
microsatellite probes gave specific signals (Table 1) and
13 of them mapped to unique chromosome loci. Clone
Boms20 hybridised to two neighbouring bands of the
same chromosome region, Boms31 hybridised to two
regions on the same chromosome arm, while Boms25
mapped to three regions on two chromosome arms (Table
1, Fig. 1) [Note that microsatellite loci and clones' names
are written in italics whereas microsatellite markers'
names are written in regular font]. These microsatellite
clones gave the same multiple hybridisation pattern even
at the higher hybridisation temperature of 62°C. Chromosome localization was not possible for four of the microsatellite probes, although tested at several hybridisation
temperatures. Lack of hybridization signal can be attributed either to insufficient hybridization due to small
probe length or to the fact that these clones may lie in heterochromatic regions (such as sex chromosomes or centromeric regions). Boms33 gave no detectable signal, while
the remaining three gave multiple signals.
The thirteen microsatellites that uniquely mapped to the
polytene chromosomes of B. oleae are dispersed on seven
polytene arms, establishing genetic markers for all five
autosomes. Table 1 summarizes the microsatellite hybridization sites and Figure 1 schematically presents the relative positions of the hybridization signals to the polytene
chromosome arms of B. oleae together with previously
described markers [21]. Hybridization signals are presented in Figure 2.

lution cytogenetic map that will facilitate future genome
projects of the species. It is encouraging that these thirteen
markers are dispersed in seven of the ten chromosome
arms (except IR, IIIL, VL). However, our in situ hybridization data are still limited to support a claim of a uniform
distribution of microsatellite loci in the olive fly genome.
Development of microsatellite markers
Unique sequences flanking each repeat array were used to
design PCR primer pairs for the amplification of 42 microsatellites. Thirty-one primer pairs amplified a product of
the expected size, as revealed by agarose gel electrophoresis (Table 2). Subsequently, all primer pairs that amplified
a specific band were used for the genotyping of 20 individual wild flies (from Greece and Cyprus) and/or up to 37
individuals of a laboratory strain. In addition, 19 C. capitata microsatellite markers (Stratikopoulos et al., submitted) that cross-amplified in the olive fly were used, raising
the total number of functional primer pairs to 50 (Table
2). In total, 37 primer pairs (29 designed for the olive fly
and eight for the medfly) amplified a polymorphic and
easily scorable PCR product, while eight pairs amplified a
monomorphic one. The five remaining primer pairs generated PCR products that were not easily scored (shuttered
or multiple bands or faint signal).

The mean allele number per locus was 4.63 for natural
populations and 3.14 for laboratory strains (monomorphic loci excluded), demonstrating their usefulness in
population analyses of the species. Conformation to HWE
was tested for 26 loci for natural populations and 19 loci
for laboratory strains, according to G2 criterion, at a significance level of 5%. Only five deviations were observed due
to homozygosity excess, which can be attributed to small
sample size or to the presence of null alleles (Table 2).
Cross – species amplification in Tephritidae
The 29 primer pairs designed for the olive fly and proved
polymorphic were tested in a pooled mix of five flies from
each one of 11 Tephritidae species. Twenty-six of them
amplified a specific DNA fragment, at least in one of the
species examined. Four species belong to Bactrocera (B.
correcta, B. cucurbitae, B. dorsalis and B. tryoni), four to
Anastrepha (A. fraterculus, A. ludens, A. serpetina and A. striata), two to Ceratitis (C. capitata and C. fasciventris) and
one belongs to Rhagoletis (R. cerasi) (Tables 3 and 4).

Although their number is small, they enrich the already
existing cytological map and are the basis for a low-resoPage 4 of 14

Schematic representation of the in situ localization of microsatellite markers on the polytene chromosomes of Bactrocera oleae

Bactrocera oleae. Arrows that originate from numbers in bold stand for the Boms microsatellite markers. Underlined numbers refer to microsatellite markers that give multiple signals. All other arrows refer to previously mapped loci [Zambetaki et
al 1999].

A total of 113 PCR products were amplified. The species
with the highest degree of amplification was B. tryoni (19/
29), while with the lowest was Rhagoletis cerasi (8/29). As
expected, the highest percentage of amplification was
inside Bactrocera, with a mean of 49.1%. Ceratitis presented the next higher amplification degree (34.5%), followed by Rhagoletis and Anastrepha (27.6% and 24.1%,
respectively) (Table 4 and Figure 3-1). It is worth mentioning that B. cucurbitae exhibited very low amplification
rate, similar to that of Anastrepha. Finally, C. capitata presented substantially lower degree of amplification than C.
fasciventris.

The majority of PCR products had similar size (less than
~50 bp difference, as estimated by agarose gel electrophoresis) with those obtained in B. oleae (about 76%).
Still, the highest degree of PCR product size conservation
was inside Bactrocera (84.2%), although Ceratitis showed
a comparable percentage (80%). Anastrepha and Rhagoletis
presented significantly lower values (64.3% and 50%,
respectively) (Table 4 and Figure 3-2). Surprisingly, B.
cucurbitae showed very low size conservation (66.7%),
comparable to that of Anastrepha, implying that the low
amplification value mentioned before may not be a PCR
artefact. This in not the case in C. capitata, since size con-

servation is very high (87.5%). This value is higher than
that of C. fasciventris and comparable to that of Bactrocera,
suggesting that medfly's low amplification value is more
likely a PCR artefact.
Analysis of cross-species amplification products
Amplification of a band of expected size does not necessarily mean that the expected microsatellite motif is also
present. To evaluate the degree of motif conservation, 31
of the reactions that produced a specific band were subcloned and sequenced. We focused on PCR products of
similar to the expected size and distributed in as many
species as possible. Twenty-seven of the amplification
products harboured a repeat motif, 25 of which contained
the same as that of B. oleae. Six of the products harboured
new motifs (instead of or in addition to the expected
ones) (Table 5).

Nineteen (of the 31) sequencing reactions were performed in Bactrocera. The presence of a microsatellite
motif in 18 of them (16 of which had the expected motif),
demonstrates their potential in the analysis of other Bactrocera species. Results from other genera are encouraging,
although preliminary. In Ceratitis, for example, four
sequencing reactions were performed, three of which
exhibited the expected motif. In Anastrepha, five sequencing reactions were performed, all of which exhibited a
microsatellite motif with four cases possessing the
expected one (however, they all refer to the same locus in
four different species). Finally, in Rhagoletis, three
sequencing reactions were performed, one of which
exhibited a microsatellite repeat of the expected motif.
These results are summarized in Tables 4 and 5 and demonstrate the potential utility of these markers in the analysis of Tephritidae genera other than Bactrocera.

(-): in HWE; (+): out of HWE

Mean number of uninterrupted repeats was measured
only in cases where the expected motif was present in
cross-species amplification products (Table 4). In seventeen cases within Bactrocera (regarding seven microsatellite loci), the mean number of uninterrupted repeats was
9.8 for B. oleae and 5.4 for the other Bactrocera species.
Same analysis for three PCR products (regarding three
microsatellites) in Ceratitis gave a mean of 9.0 and 5.0
uninterrupted repeats for B. oleae and Ceratitis, respectively. Although sequencing data are still limited, it is
obvious that microsatellites tend to present longer arrays
in the species in which they were isolated from. This has
been described in a variety of species, such as Drosophila
[40,46] and primates [47], and has been attributed to the
fact that microsatellites can evolve directionally and at different rates in closely related species.
Sequencing analysis and phylogenetic comparisons
Although we did not perform a phylogenetic analysis, it
seems that measures of cross-species amplification (e.g.,
percentages of functional primers and expected size of
PCR products) are indicative of the phylogenetic history
of these species. Our results support the notion that three
of the Bactrocera species are very close to B. oleae, while
the fourth (B. cucurbitae) seems to be more distant (Table
4, Figure 3). Also, Ceratitis seems to be more closely
related to Bactrocera than Anastrepha and Rhagoletis seems
to be the most distantly related genus to Bactrocera. These
results perfectly replicate the exact same relationships

observed in the most recent phylogenetic analysis of these
species based on mtDNA sequencing data [48]. Secondarily, they are also supported by several other studies from
different insect species based on alignment of mitochondrial 16S rDNA sequences [49,50] and 18S rDNA
sequences [51], which show that Bactrocera is more closely
related to Ceratitis, and closer to Anastrepha than it is to
Rhagoletis. In addition, we also performed sequencing
alignments of a few cross-species amplification products
of some of our markers (data not shown). In all cases, the
different species were clustered to their respective genera
with high bootstrap values. Although these data are very
limited, they come from dispersed regions of nuclear
DNA which gives significant value to phylogenetic analyses. There are studies supporting that microsatellite data
can shed light to phylogenetic relationships among
closely related taxa [52-54]. Sequencing analysis of more
microsatellite markers can probably reveal complex phylogenetic relationships among different Tephritidae species, especially in cases of species complexes.
Polymorphism of cross-species microsatellite markers
Presence of a microsatellite motif does not necessarily
mean that these loci can be used as genetic markers. Nineteen microsatellite markers developed in the medfly crossamplified in the olive fly (Table 2). The fact that eight of
them were polymorphic in a relative small sample (twenty
wild flies) confirms the possible utility of the markers presented here in the analysis of other Tephritidae species.

Conclusion
Since their discovery, microsatellite markers have been
particularly useful in population and genetic analyses,
mainly due to their high degree of polymorphism. Their
significance is even greater in organisms like the olive fly,
where the lack of morphological markers makes classical
genetic analysis practically impossible. The interest in
olive fly's genetics is not only theoretical, since modern
genetic and molecular tools have benefited several operational SIT programmes, particularly those where GSSs are
involved [15]. The observed polymorphism of the developed microsatellite markers (both in laboratory and natural populations) guarantees their utility in genetic and

population analyses. A subset of these markers has already
been successfully used in previous population studies
[36,19]. The existence of well-described polytene chromosomes in the olive fly [21] and the possibility of cytological localization of molecular markers by in situ
hybridisation provide a powerful method to link the
genetic and molecular information of an organism. The
existence of defined polytene chromosomes in other Diptera [55,56] also offers the opportunity to establish syntenic linkages and to study the evolutionary relationships
of separate chromosomal segments [57,21]. Cross-species
amplification of the developed markers to other Tephritidae demonstrates their potential utility in those species.

Functional primer pairs: number of primer pairs that cross-amplified successfully; Expected size: number of primer pairs that cross-amplified and
produced fragment of the expected size (calculated either in regard to total available primer pairs or in regard to primer pairs that successfully
cross-amplified); Presence of SSR motif: number of cross-species amplification products that harboured a microsatellite motif; Presence of the expected

sequencing reactions or in regard to cross-species amplification products that harboured a microsatellite motif); Mean number of uninterrupted
repeats: sum and comparison of the number of uninterrupted repeats for primer pairs that cross-amplified and harboured the expected motif.
Dividend represents repeats in the new species, while divider stands for number of repeats in B. oleae

Sequencing analysis of several cross-amplified products
revealed a varying degree of conservation that declines
outside the Bactrocera genus. Such sequencing analyses
can also assist the clarification of phylogenetic relationships among different species, particularly in cases of species complexes.

Methods

Laboratory strain
B. oleae flies used for in situ hybridisation and polymorphism analysis were obtained from the Department of
Biology, "Demokritos" Nuclear Research Center, Athens,
Greece. In our laboratory the stock was reared on an artificial medium based on yeast hydrolysate, sucrose, egg
yolk and water [58-60] at 25 ± 1°C and a 12 h light: 12 h
dark
cycle.

Fly culture and stocks
Field-collected samples: Olive fruits were collected and
kept in the laboratory until adult flies emerged. These flies
were preserved individually at -20°C until DNA extraction.

Construction and screening of total small insert genomic
libraries
Genomic DNA was extracted from adult flies of the laboratory strain as described in [61]. Approximately 3 μg of

genomic DNA were digested to completion with MboI and
digestion products were electrophoresed in 1% agarose
gel (Seakem GTG). Restriction fragments that ranged
between 500 bp and 1200 bp were isolated from the gel
(Jetquick gel extraction kit, Genomed) and cloned into
the BamHI site of plasmid vector pBlueskript II SK (Stratagene). About 104 recombinant clones were transferred
onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham),
screened with a mix of radioactively labeled (CT)15 and
(GT)15 oligonucleotides. Labelling was performed with
terminal transferase (Promega), under the conditions suggested by the manufacturer. Hybridisation was performed
at 48°C in standard hybridisation solution (6× SSC, 0.5%
SDS, 5× Denhardt's) for at least 16 hours. Membranes
were then washed twice for 5 min in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS at
25°C and once for 15 min in 1× SSC/0.1% SDS at 37°C
and subsequently exposed with film. Positive colonies
underwent a secondary screening and plasmid DNA was
then purified by the alkaline lysis method [62] and electrophoresed. Clones of convenient size inserts (i.e., 500–
1000 bp) were sequenced (Thermo Sequenase core
Sequencing kit, Amersham). Sequencing reactions were
analysed in an automatic sequenator and the microsatellite repeat motif was determined.

Construction of microsatellite-enriched genomic libraries
Genomic DNA was extracted as above. Enriched libraries
were prepared according to [63]. Seven libraries were constructed using different oligonucleotide probes [(GA)15,
(CA)15, (GT)15, (CT)15, (AT)15, (GC)15 and (GAC)10]. Two
rounds of enrichment were performed for each library.
Enriched products were cloned either in plasmid vector
pBlueskript SKII digested with EcoRI, (without removal of
the amplification linkers), or into the BamHI site of the
pUC18 vector (Ready-To-Go™ pUC18/BamHI, Amersham), (after linker removal). Insert size of recombinant
clones was estimated on agarose gels and selected clones
were sequenced as above. Selection was done either at random, or after Southern transfer and hybridization with
(GT)15 and (CT)15 radiolabelled probes.
In situ hybridization procedures
Squash preparations of salivary gland chromosomes were
made from 10–12 day-old third instar larvae and 1–2 day
old pupae, as previously described [64]. Microsatellite
containing clones were labelled with digoxigenated dUTP
(Dig-11dUTP) using the random priming method and in
situ hybridized to polytene chromosomes according to
[64]. Hybridization temperature was 55–62°C (Table 1).
Signals were detected with specific antibodies (ROCHE

Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Five or more chromosomal preparations were hybridized with each probe
and at least ten well-spread polytene nuclei per preparation were examined to identify the hybridization signals.
Genotyping
PCR amplification was performed in a 10 μl volume that
contained ~10 ng of DNA, 1.6 mM MgCl2, 1× reaction
buffer [Promega: 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 50 mM KCl,
0.1% Triton X-100], 0.2 U Taq polymerase (Promega), 0.2
mM of each dNTP, 3 pmol of each primer. PCR products
were subsequently separated in 1.5% agarose gels. For
genotyping, PCRs were performed as above with the only
difference that one fifth of one of the primers of each pair
was end-labeled with [γ32P]-ATP, using T4 polynucleotide
kinase (MBI, Fermentas) [65]. Amplification was performed on a PTC-100 thermocycler (MJ Research Inc) for
30 cycles of 1 min at 95°C, 1 min at 50°C and 1 min at
72°C. PCR products were electrophoresed on 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography.

Data analysis
Genetic variability was measured as the mean number of
alleles per locus, effective number of alleles and observed
and expected heterozygosity. Conformation to HWE was
tested at a significance level of 5%, according to G2 criterion. All computations were performed with POPGENE
version 1.31 software [66].
Sequencing of cross-species amplification products
PCR products were electrophoresed, isolated from gel
with the 'PCR Clean up and Gel extraction' kit (Nucleospin) and subsequently ligated to the pCR2.1-TOPO vector
with the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). Recombinant
vectors were used to transform E. coli competent cells of
the XL-1 strain. Plasmid DNA was extracted with the alkaline lysis method, as above and sequence analysis was performed by Macrogen Inc (Korea).
