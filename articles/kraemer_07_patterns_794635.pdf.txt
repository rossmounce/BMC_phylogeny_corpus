Abstract
Background: Var genes encode a family of virulence factors known as PfEMP1 (Plasmodium
falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1) which are responsible for both antigenic variation and
cytoadherence of infected erythrocytes. Although these molecules play a central role in malaria
pathogenesis, the mechanisms generating variant antigen diversification are poorly understood. To
investigate var gene evolution, we compared the variant antigen repertoires from three
geographically diverse parasite isolates: the 3D7 genome reference isolate; the recently sequenced
HB3 isolate; and the IT4/25/5 (IT4) parasite isolate which retains the capacity to cytoadhere in vitro
and in vivo.
Results: These comparisons revealed that only two var genes (var1csa and var2csa) are conserved
in all three isolates and one var gene (Type 3 var) has homologs in IT4 and 3D7. While the remaining
50 plus genes in each isolate are highly divergent most can be classified into the three previously
defined major groups (A, B, and C) on the basis of 5' flanking sequence and chromosome location.
Repertoire-wide sequence comparisons suggest that the conserved homologs are evolving
separately from other var genes and that genes in group A have diverged from other groups.
Conclusion: These findings support the existence of a var gene recombination hierarchy that
restricts recombination possibilities and has a central role in the functional and immunological
adaptation of var genes.

Background
Malaria pathogenesis poses a major hindrance to development in many parts of the world with more than 500 million people suffering from the disease and at least one
million dying from P. falciparum infection each year [1].
Disease severity has been associated with the accumulation of infected erythrocytes (IEs) in microvasculature of
vital organs, such as the brain and placenta [2]. A key protein family involved in IE binding is the antigenic variant
P. falciparum Erythrocyte Membrane 1 (PfEMP1) [3-5].
Each parasite genome contains about 60 var genes that
encode PfEMP1 proteins [6], which are expressed in a
mutually exclusive fashion at the IE surface [7,8]. Switches
in var gene expression allow parasites to evade the host
antibody response and sequester at different microvascular sites in the body [9]. Therefore, further definition of
the var gene family conservation, the factors regulating
variant antigen gene diversification, and the expression of
particular var genes during disease will provide critical
insights into malaria pathogenesis and aid disease interventions.
Var genes have a two-exon structure [4]. The first exon is
large (~3.5 to 9.0 kb) and encodes multiple adhesion
domains called the Duffy binding-like (DBL) and
cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDR). The second
exon is smaller (~1.0 to 1.5 kb) and codes for a more conserved cytoplasmic tail. Although PfEMP1 sequences are
highly diverse, the adhesion domains can be grouped by
sequence similarity [10] into seven types of DBL domains
(α, α1,β, γ, δ, ε, and x) and four types of CIDR domains (α,
α1, β, and γ) that have been used as criteria for dissecting
PfEMP1 protein domain structures and binding functions.
The PfEMP1 proteins in the 3D7 genome have been arbitrarily classified into one of seventeen different protein
architectural types based upon domain composition
[6,11] and divided into three major (A, B, and C) and two
intermediate (B/A and B/C) groups on the basis of 5'
upstream (Ups) sequence and chromosomal location
[6,12,13]. Var group A genes have UpsA flanking
sequences and are located in sub-telomeric regions transcribed toward the telomere, while group B consists of telomeric var genes flanked by UpsB sequences that are
transcribed toward the centromere, and group C are
flanked by UpsC sequences and are located in central
chromosomal regions. Group B/A genes are very similar
in location and transcriptional orientation to group B
genes, but are located further from the telomere following
other var genes or pseudogenes. In contrast, group B/C
genes have an UpsB-like 5' flanking sequence, but are
located in central chromosomal regions. Thus, it has been
postulated that groups B/A and B/C represent transitional
groups between the major groupings [13].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/45

Inter-isolate comparisons have also revealed the existence
of three unusual genes: var1csa, var2csa, and Type 3 var
genes, which appear in nearly all parasite isolates [12,1419]. These semi-conserved homologs may have important
roles in the host-parasite interaction. The PfEMP1
encoded by var2csa binds the placental adhesion receptor,
chondroitin sulfate A (CSA), and therefore has a critical
role in the pathogenesis of pregnancy associated malaria
[20,21], while no function has yet been ascribed to the
proteins encoded by var1csa and Type 3 var.
The genomic organization of var genes may have an
important role in var gene evolution. Similar to other variant antigen families, gene recombination or gene conversion between var paralogs may contribute to the rapid
evolution of the gene family [22-24]. It has been hypothesized that the frequency of recombination between var
genes may depend upon chromosomal location, gene orientation, and homology in the gene flanking sequence.
Sequence and binding analysis of 3D7 var genes indicate
that groups B and C PfEMP1 proteins bind the primary
microvasculature receptor (CD36) while group A PfEMP1
proteins do not [12,13,25]. Thus, var gene recombination
hierarchies may promote the evolution of PfEMP1 adhesion groups with different patterns of sequestration and
disease. A fundamental question is whether the gene
organization observed in 3D7 occurs in other parasite isolates and contributes to a general recombination mechanism shaping the variant antigen repertoire.
To investigate evolutionary mechanisms of the var gene
family and provide new tools to study the role of PfEMP1
proteins in mediating cytoadhesion, we have sequenced
var genes from isolate IT4/25/4 (IT4), which has maintained the ability to cytoadhere after in vitro adaptation
[26-29], and compared these genes to the var repertories
of the 3D7 genome reference isolate and of the HB3 isolate, for which sequence contigs were recently made available (Plasmodium falciparum HB3 Sequencing Project,
Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT [30]). Although there
are currently relatively few reports, isolate HB3 also maintains cytoadherence in culture [31,32] and is therefore a
useful addition to comparative var analyses.
All three parasites, IT4, HB3, and 3D7, have been cloned
in vitro and represent single parasite genotypes. The IT4
parasite was originally isolated from Brazil [33], but is
known to have undergone accidental cross-contamination at an early stage of its history after in vitro adaptation
[34]. The HB3 clone was derived from the Honduras I/
CDC isolate [35] and the NF54 parent to the 3D7 clone
was isolated from an individual who lived near an airport
in Amsterdam and never left the Netherlands [36]. Based
upon genotyping and parasite population studies, IT4

groups with Asian isolates, 3D7 groups with African isolates, and HB3 represents Central America [37].
Despite progress in understanding the mechanisms of
cytoadhesion and antigenic variation of PfEMP1, limited
information about the factors regulating variant antigen
diversification and the extent of repertoire overlap
between parasite isolates exists. Most studies have relied
on small var sequence "tags" amplified from the first DBL
domain in PfEMP1 proteins [19,23,38-48]. The studies
presented here represent the first comprehensive analyses
of var genes across multiple parasite isolates. These comparisons reveal general principles of var gene organization
that have become established across geographically
diverse parasite isolates and provide powerful tools to
study the cytoadherent and immunogenic properties of
PfEMP1 proteins.

Results
The var gene repertoires from the IT4 and HB3 isolates
Conservation in the var gene 5' and 3' gene-flanking
regions, the semi-conserved exon 2, and other domains
allowed us to design a series of primers (Additional file 4:
Table S1) and extend IT4 var tags that we had previously
sequenced from the PfEMP1 DBLα, β, γ, and δ domains
[49]. We sequenced 28 full-length var genes and 10 partial
genes from the IT4 isolate [GenBank:EF158071EF158105], in addition to the 10 full-length var genes that
have been previously characterized (Figure 1). These
genes represent all but 11 of the 59 IT4 sequence tags
identified from other studies (Tables S2 and S3)[42,4951]. In order to estimate the proportion of IT4 var genes
represented by these sequences, we searched the 1× coverage IT4 genome sequence at the Wellcome Trust Sanger
Institute [52] for additional var sequences. Out of 949
reads with sequence similarity to the first exon of any
known var genes, only ~15% do not overlap with our data
set. Assembly of these reads shows that most of the nonoverlapping reads represent small sequence fragments no
larger than a single read and three partial gene fragments
of 3–4 kb (data not shown). Thus, the var gene repertoire
presented here includes partial or complete sequence for
most IT4 var genes. Eight var genes were mapped to specific chromosomes using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
and Southern analysis (Figure 1, data not shown) and in
some cases, intrachromosomal location (central versus
sub-telomeric) was identified based on ApaI restriction
fragment length [53]. The chromosomal locations of a
further 13 var genes were based on previously published
data [42].

Analysis of the HB3 sequence contigs obtained from the
10× coverage genome sequence at the Broad Institute[30]
identified 52 var genes that contain a DBLα domain as
well as two var2csa homologs; 39 of the 54 var genes are

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/45

full-length, 9 are incomplete and six are pseudogenes containing stops or frame-shifts (Figure 2). Examination of 5'
and 3' flanking sequences (see Materials and Methods)
enabled us to predict the chromosomal location of most
genes (Figure 2), although in a number of cases they could
not be assigned to specific chromosome ends. These predictions assume that recombination has not changed the
arrangement of chromosome ends in HB3 and 3D7.
Comparisons of the IT4 and HB3 PfEMP1 protein domain
architecture revealed representatives of most classes previously described in 3D7 (Additional file 1) [6] plus fourteen new types (Figures 1 &2). Of the 31 domain
architectures, most types contain only a single representative per isolate and only seven (1, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13, and 17)
are found in all three isolates. While five (2, 6, 9, 14, and
16) are found only in 3D7, eight (18–25) are unique to
IT4, and six (26–31) to HB3 (Table 1). Moreover, the distribution of var genes among the shared domain architecture classes differs substantially between isolates. More
than half (40/62) of the 3D7 var genes have a Type 1
architecture, but this type of var gene is rarer in IT4 (12/
48) and HB3 (20/54). Conversely, IT4 contains six Type
11 var genes compared to only one in 3D7 and HB3; while
HB3 contains six representatives of Type 27, which is not
present in either 3D7 or IT4. The differential abundance
of individual PfEMP1 types between parasite isolates and
the presence of new PfEMP1 types in isolates IT4 and HB3
indicate considerable inter-strain plasticity in the variant
antigen repertoire. Despite these differences in gene repertoires, the previously described tandem domain associations (DBLα-CIDR1, DBLβ-c2, and DBLδ-CIDR non-α
types)[6,10] are consistently preserved, indicating the
potential structural and functional significance of these
domain relationships.
While seven protein architectural types are shared among
the three isolates, most var genes have overall amino acid
sequence identities of < 50% in individual domains
(Additional file 2), even those within the same architectural type. However, three var genes (var1csa, var2csa, and
Type 3 var) are highly conserved at the sequence level,
with > 75% identity over multiple domains. Partial gene
sequence tags for these three var genes have been amplified from many parasite isolates indicating their unusual
conservation for the var gene family [19]. However, these
isolate-transcendent members can have different copy
numbers between parasite isolates. For instance, while
3D7 has three copies of the Type 3 var, we could amplify
only one copy in IT4 and did not find any copies in the
genomic sequence from HB3. In addition, HB3 contains
two var2csa copies rather than one copy as in 3D7 and IT4.
Although var1csa is present in all three parasites, it is a
truncated pseudogene in 3D7 (first exon) and the second
exon has a frameshift in the HB3 allele. Also, var1csa is

Schematic representation of the IT4 var gene repertoire
Figure 1
Schematic representation of the IT4 var gene repertoire. Gene names, Ups sequence type, domain architecture, chromosomal location, transcription orientation, and binding functions are listed. IT4 var genes are primarily assigned to different
groups on the basis of 5' flanking sequence (Ups type) and chromosomal location when known. PfEMP1 proteins are comprised
of multiple domains termed N-termimal segment (NTS), Duffy binding-like (DBL), cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDR),
C2, transmembrane (TM), and acidic terminal segment (ATS or exon2) which have been classified by sequence criteria into different types. The PfEMP1 proteins in the 3D7 clone were arbitrarily classified into 17 different protein architectural types on
the basis of domain composition [6]. Types 18–25 (bolded) are unique to IT4. Chromosome locations are indicated as T, ST,
SST: first, second, and third var genes from the telomere respectively. C: internal var genes. t: transcribed towards telomere, c:
transcribed towards centromere. The chromosomal location of var2csa was determined in [78]. Accession numbers for newly
sequenced genes are EF158071-EF158105.

believed to be truncated in many field isolates [18] and
has a distinct gene transcription pattern from other var
genes [54]. Therefore it may have a different biological
role than other var genes.
Sequence comparison of 1.5–2.0 kb of 5' flanking
sequence from the 3D7 var genes has defined five
upstream types; UpsA, B, C, D, and E types [6,11-13]. Phylogenetic analysis of 500 bp of 5' flanking sequences from
the IT4, HB3, and 3D7 var genes revealed that IT4 and
HB3 have similar sequence groupings as 3D7 (Figure 3).
While we found similar classes as in previous studies, we
have sub-divided UpsB into four sub-groups (B1–B4) and
UpsC into two sub-groups (C1 and C2). This study also
revealed that UpsD is very similar to UpsA (Figure 3), and
that these categories can be more accurately referred to as
UpsA1 (formerly UpsA) and UpsA2 (formerly UpsD).
Notably, the proportion of var genes in each Ups type is
similar between isolates (Figures 1, 2, S1).
The 3D7 var gene repertoire has been previously categorized into three major (A, B, and C) and two intermediate
(B/A and B/C) groups on the basis of Ups sequence and
chromosomal location [6,12,13]. The HB3 and IT4 var
genes can be similarly assigned to the three major groups
on the basis of Ups sequence (Figure 3), but differences in
chromosomal location between isolates argue for a modification of the sub-groupings. For example, the HB3 repertoire contains one UpsA1-associated var gene (HB3var6)
that is in a central chromosomal cluster rather than the
typical sub-telomeric location (Figure 4). Therefore, to
allow for the future addition of 'atypical' genes, we have
developed a naming system based upon var gene location
and Ups sequence type. The Ups types (A1-2, B1-B4, C1-

2, and E) when known are listed first followed by a chromosome location reference. T, ST, and SST refer to the
first, second, and third var genes from the telomere respectively and C refers to central var genes. For example, we
have now separated var group A into sub-groups A1C,
A1ST, and A1SST to represent central and sub-telomeric
var genes, respectively. Similarly, group B is divided to
represent var genes with corresponding central (B1C, B2C,
etc.) or telomeric (B1T, B2T, etc.) locations. Members of
the B/A group previously defined by Lavstsen et al. [13] are
now classified as B1ST, B2ST, etc. denoting both the 5'
upstream type plus a distinct sub-telomeric chromosomal
location which follows other var genes or pseudogenes
[6].
As observed previously [55], the var gene chromosomal
location was highly predictive of 5' gene flanking
sequence (Figure 4). For instance, nearly all centromeretranscribed var genes in the telomeric location were
UpsB1 type (Figure 4). In contrast, members of the "transitional" B/C var group located in central chromosomal
locations, associate with any of the 5' flanking sequences
UpsB1-4. Interestingly, while HB3 contains a copy of the
semi-conserved var1csa gene (domain architecture Type
17) with the expected UpsA2 sequence (formerly UpsD),
the HB3 isolate is unique in having a second distinct
PfEMP1 protein associated with the UpsA2 sequence
(HB3var4, domain architecture Type 10). Thus, we have
classified both within group A2ST. The highly conserved,
and sequence divergent, var2csa remains in a separate Ups
group (ET, EST, or ESST).

genes in sub-telomeric regions or central regions on chro-

mosomes 4, 6, 7, 8, and 12 are similar between the three
isolates, the genes themselves are not conserved with the
exception of var1csa, var2csa and Type 3 var. Significantly,var genes in the same chromosomal location from
the three isolates differ in both sequence and protein
architecture (Figure 4, Additional file 4: Table S4). Furthermore, the order of var Ups types in central var gene
clusters differ between isolates (Figure 4). These differences between isolates are evidence of gene recombination that has occurred within the coding and geneflanking regions.
Var gene recombination
To study the genetic relationship of different var genes, we
performed repertoire-wide nucleotide and amino acid
sequence comparisons using a number of different
approaches and visualization tools (see Materials and
Methods). The Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) [56] was
used to visualize regions of similarity identified by reciprocal BLASTN searches of var exon1 nucleotide sequences.
Using criteria of a word size of 90nt, > 90% identity we
observed the gene duplication in 3D7 (PFD1235w and
MAL8P1.207) and identified one gene duplication in HB3
(var2csaA and var2csaB). These gene pairs are nearly identical over their entire lengths (Figure 5 & Additional file 4:
Table S5). These analyses also visualize the semi-conserved var genes (var1csa, var2csa and Type 3 var) identified above, which have multiple regions of high sequence
similarity (> 90%) between isolates (Additional file 4:
Table S5).

ACT comparisons also identified several instances of partial sequence similarity (greater than 500 bp) between two
var genes of the same isolate. Selected examples are shown
(Table 2), illustrating the segmental nature of sequence
similarity between genes, with only part of each sequence
showing a high degree of sequence similarity to the other
partner(s). The 3D7 repertoire contains four examples of
such "chimeric" gene pairs, the current set of IT4 var genes
has eight, and the HB3 repertoire has six (Table 2). In
some cases (e.g. PFD0995c/PFD1000c/PFD1005c in 3D7),
a var gene appears to be a "true" chimera of two different
var genes (Figure 6), while in other cases the chimeras represent partial duplications between two var genes.
Despite geographic separation of 3D7, IT4, and 3D7, similar examples of segmental sequence similarity greater
than 500 bp can be seen between var genes of the different
isolates; with five examples between 3D7 and HB3, three
between HB3 and IT4 and one between 3D7 and IT4
(Table 2). Remarkably, one of the inter-isolate gene pairs,
HB3var23 and PFL1950w, are both the first var genes in a
central cluster on chromosome 12 (Figure 4). These two
genes have nearly identical and highly distinctive UpsB4
type 5' flanking sequences (Figure 3) and share approxi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/45

mately 1000 bp of coding region identity (Table 2), but
otherwise have diverged from one another. This region of
similarity identifies a recombination event that likely predates the continental separation of P. falciparum isolates.
These analyses also demonstrate that most var genes share
little sequence identity suggesting that the var genes have
diverged extensively between parasite isolates and have
undergone segmental recombination (Figure 5). However, the patterns of sequence identities are not random in
that similarities preferentially occur between members of
the same Ups group (Table 2). For instance, UpsA1 var
genes are 7.3× more likely to share similarity with other
UpsA1 genes than with different Ups groups and UpsB24 var genes are 8.6× more likely to share similarity within
the UpsB2-4 group (Additional file 4: Table S6). The same
trend holds for gene similarities involving smaller gene
segments 90 nucleotides and up (Additional file 4: Table
S6). An exception is central var genes, which contain
"mixed" chimeras of UpsB and UpsC-associated var genes
(Figure 6), suggesting both groups of central chromosome
var genes are recombining.
To detect patterns of protein similarities, we conducted
"repertoire-wide" dot-plot analyses using concatamers of
var exon1 sequences ordered by isolate and 5' flanking
sequence type. These analyses are designed to detect small
windows of sequence similarity (80% amino acid identity, 30 amino acid window length) between PfEMP1
amino acid sequences and clearly show that UpsA
PfEMP1 proteins share less similarity with UpsB and
UpsC proteins than with other UpsA proteins (Figure 7).
Conversely, UpsB and UpsC proteins are indistinguishable in terms of their degree of sequence identity with each
other. This analysis combined with the analyses of individual domains (Additional file 2) shows approximately
as much overall repertoire similarity within as between
these geographically diverse strains.
To identify the regions of similarity between PfEMP1 proteins, the dotplot matches were plotted along the length
of individual proteins. Overall, the DBL1 domains in
PfEMP1 proteins tend to have the most similarity between
proteins, although there are regions of similarity in some
CIDR domains (Additional file 3). Most of the similarity
between PfEMP1 proteins, including between the B and C
groups, is associated with semi-conserved homology
blocks in DBL domains (Additional file 3). These homology blocks correspond to structural elements in solved
structures [57,58]. These analyses also clearly illustrate
that var2csa and Type 3 proteins share almost no identity
with other PfEMP1 proteins. Curiously, the rosettingassociated IT4var60 protein is not related to other UpsA
proteins over most of its length (data not shown). However, unlike the semi-conserved Type 3 var or var2csa, HB3

ACT nucleotide comparison of var gene repertoires
Figure 5
ACT nucleotide comparison of var gene repertoires. Concatamers of var gene exon1 sequences were arranged sequentially by Ups type: UpsE, A, C, B2-4, and B1, (colored as indicated) with one genome per horizontal line. The isolate-transcendent var genes var2csa, var1csa and Type 3 var are positioned at the left end of the concatemer. BLASTN was performed with
word length set at 90 nucleotides (filter for low complexity removed). The comparisons were viewed in ACT with a window
size of 120 nucleotides, at minimum 90% identity to show segments of similarity between var genes. Diagonal bands connecting
individual var genes are colored according to percent identity, shown in the scale diagram (inset). Band width corresponds to

and 3D7 do not have a var60 homolog. Although this
result suggests that IT4var60 is not recombining with
other var genes, more study is needed to determine its
conservation in the parasite population. Taken together,
these sequence comparisons support the hypothesis that
var genes have differentiated into separately recombining
groups that may be important to the evolution of the
structure and function of PfEMP1 proteins.

Discussion
While the sequencing of the 3D7 genome has contributed
greatly in determining PfEMP1 functions and genetic
diversity [reviewed in [11]], the associations of var gene
repertoires within and between parasite isolates and the
factors regulating variant antigen diversification remain
largely unknown. To gain understanding into the evolutionary mechanisms shaping the variant antigen repertoire we present here the nearly complete var repertoire of
a cytoadhesive laboratory isolate, IT4/25/5, and compare

it to the 3D7 genome reference isolate and the recently
sequenced HB3 genome.
Despite the enormous diversity of these genes, several features of the var gene family are conserved across isolates
including var groupings based upon central or telomeric
chromosome location and 5' flanking sequence that may
have an important role in the evolution and function of
var genes. It has been hypothesized that an original ancestral var gene was duplicated and diverged into the three
main var groups (A, B, and C) and subsequently into additional transitional groups [13]. This interpretation is supported by our analyses showing similar categories of var
genes in all three parasite isolates.
Based upon sequence comparisons, B and C groups are
more similar, even though these genes tend to occupy different chromosomal locations at sub-telomeric and central chromosomal regions, respectively. However, the

respectively.
cHighlighted rows indicate multiple hits of high sequence similarity, shared between the same gene pairs.
bThese

regions of similarity are predominantly associated with
semiconserved homology blocks that are predicted to
form the structural scaffolding for the DBL adhesion
domains. Conversely, the group A genes differ greatly
from the B and C groups while the coding region of the
three isolate transcendent var genes, var1csa, var2csa, and
Type 3 var genes have unique features and are different
from all other var genes. However, these isolate transcendent var genes are more related to the UpsA group in that
they are sub-telomeric, transcribed towards the telomere,
and have 5' gene flanking regions that most resemble the
UpsA type.
Repertoire-wide sequence comparisons show that most
gene similarities occur between genes within the same var

group, particularly for gene segments larger than 500 bp.
An exception is central var clusters, which contain both
UpsB and UpsC-associated var genes. While the functional significance of these different 5' promoter types is
not completely understood [59], these two sets of central
var genes appear to be recombining with each other.
Taken together, these analyses suggest that var gene
recombination preferentially occurs within var groups,
with the exception of the semi-conserved var homologs
that appear to recombine on their own. Further var gene
comparisons of parasites undergoing more frequent
recombination in nature or parasite crosses will be of
interest to determine the relative frequency of intra- versus
inter-group gene recombination. These findings provide
insight into the mechanisms that generate antigenic diver-

families in Plasmodium and other organisms.

speculate that in P. falciparum, factors that are silencing/
controlling var gene expression may also be involved in
the recombination and gene conversion mechanisms.

The mechanisms of gene recombination/conversion are
not well studied in P. falciparum. Sequence comparisons
and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of
parasite crosses and population studies suggest that both
small (~100–200 nt) and larger recombination events
contribute to var gene evolution [19,22,23]. Here, we
observe that chimeric junction sites are often not "clean"
breakpoints and have smaller sections of 90–95% identity
500 bp upstream and/or downstream of the central
homologous region (data not shown). This feature may
relate to a mechanism of recombination. Control of var
gene expression has been connected to silence-inducing
regulators of gene expression (e.g. Silent Information Regulator protein 2, SIR2) and chromatin packaging [60,61].
Recent studies have shown a possible link between factors
involved in transcription regulation (including SIR2) and
recombination (reviewed in [62,63]). It is interesting to

From a study of 3D7 var genes expressed after antibody
selection, it has been hypothesized that group A may contain common antigenic types that are responsible for
severe disease [64]. Although the duplicated 3D7 UpsA
var genes, PFD1235w and MAL8P1.207, have been proposed as a fourth isolate-transcendent variant, termed
var4, our analyses do not support this conclusion since a
var4 homolog was not found in IT4 or HB3, although the
HB3 isolate contained a match over a portion of the gene.
In addition, var4-like gene fragments were not common in
a global survey of parasite isolates using gene-specific
primers [19]. Instead, this observation may represent one
of a number of between-genome var chimeras which are
not present in all parasite genomes. More study is required
to determine which segments of var4 are maintained in
the parasite population and the extent to which the same
segments are shared by different parasite isolates.

More generally, with the exception of the Type 3 var genes
and var1csa, the UpsA-associated var genes are not highly
conserved between the three isolates. This observation
reinforces findings of high genetic diversity of UpsA-associated DBLα tags from a global collection of parasite isolates [19]. Various factors may influence the stability of
large var gene segments across a parasite population,
including malaria endemicity, the frequency of mixed
infections, or functional selection on that gene segment
for binding. The diversity of the UpsA var genes suggests
that antibody cross-reactivity between different parasite
isolates does not necessarily imply the presence of isolatetranscendent var genes, but may be due to cross-reacting
antibody epitopes on different PfEMP1 sequences.
Although the possibility that a subset of var genes may be
associated with severe malaria remains, these genes may
not be as conserved across parasite isolates as the pregnancy malaria vaccine candidate var2csa.
The concept of a recombination hierarchy has implications for the evolution of parasite virulence and disease
investigation. The conservation of var groupings across
isolates raises the possibility that var groups may be
diverging and/or evolving in characteristic patterns. For
instance, group A var genes, with the exception of the Type
3 var genes, encode larger proteins with more complex
domain compositions and have different protein head
structures (DBL1-CIDR1 domains) from other var groups
(Figures 1 &2). In contrast, the relatively small Type 1 proteins, which consist of four adhesion domains, are not
associated with group A in any of the isolates. It has been
suggested that immune selection can cause polymorphic
antigens to self-organize into sets of non-overlapping variants within a population [65]. Increased frequency of
inter-locus recombination or gene conversion may also
act as a homogenizing force leading to the functional and
structural specialization of different gene groups [25].
Interestingly, the proportion of small to larger PfEMP1
proteins and the distribution of PfEMP1 architectural
types differed between isolates. Given the different selective pressures for binding and immune evasion, it may be
to the parasite's advantage to have different sets of recombining genes [66,67]. These sets might include genes optimized to promote rapid parasite growth and transmission
in the non-immune host, diversified genes that promote
parasite transmission and persistence of infection in the
face of higher levels of host immunity or organ-specific
variants that expand parasite tropism to new host tissues,
such as the placenta.
Unlike many isolates that have been adapted to in vitro
cultivation, the IT4 genotype stably maintains the cytoadherent phenotype and therefore has become the primary
model for this virulence determinant. CD36 binding,
intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) binding, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/45

infected erythrocyte rosetting, or the binding of infected
erythrocytes to uninfected erythrocytes, have been shown
to reside in multiple different IT4 PfEMP1 proteins [for
review, see [68]]. Although proteins that bind the same
host receptor frequently use the same type of binding
domain [11], the overall protein architectures are highly
distinct. For instance, three ICAM-1 binding PfEMP1 proteins (A4tres, A4var, and IT-ICAM-1) all use DBLβ c2
domains but have different domain structure types and
two rosetting PfEMP1 proteins, R29var [51] and
FCRS1.2var1 [51,69] also have different domain structure
types and bind different receptors on the erythrocyte surface. Our study completes the sequences for three additional IT4 var genes upregulated in rosetting parasite
clones, which were previously identified by only their
DBLα tag sequences (IT4var1, IT4var27, and IT4var60)
[70]. Overall, the rosetting var protein structures are not
highly related (Figure 1), although the DBL1α1 domain is
similar between the UpsA-linked R29var and IT4var60
predicted proteins, which may be significant because
DBL1α1 is an erythrocyte binding region in R29var [51].
In contrast, the other three rosetting-linked var genes
(IT4var27, IT4var1, and FCRS1.2var1) have DBLα
domains instead of DBLα1 domains and associate with
Ups B, C, or unknown Ups sequence. While these comparisons suggest that rosetting PfEMP1 proteins are not
restricted to particular var groups, further study is needed
to determine whether rosetting proteins in the same var
group use a similar constellation of erythrocyte receptors.

Conclusion
A detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms
responsible for malaria pathogenesis is lacking, partly
because of the complexity of the var gene family and the
inability to model cytoadhesion with most cultureadapted laboratory isolates. In this study, we determined
the var gene repertoires from the IT4 and HB3 isolates and
provide evidence for a recombination hierarchy that
shapes the evolution of the PfEMP1 virulence determinant. Furthermore, determination of the nearly complete
var gene repertoire from the cytoadhesive IT4 parasite genotype, which has been adapted to both grow in the laboratory and infect new world monkeys, provides a unique
capability to model cytoadhesion and immune acquisition in vitro and in vivo. Future binding and expression
studies with cytoadhesive laboratory isolates, such as IT4
and HB3, in conjunction with analyses of the fully
sequenced genomes will allow us to classify PfEMP1 proteins into biologically meaningful subsets and greatly
accelerate understanding into malaria pathogenesis and
immune evasion.

Methods
Parasites
Var genes were cloned from genomic DNA of the A4
clonal line. The A4 clone was originally derived by micromanipulation from P. falciparum isolate IT4/25/5 [29].
The IT4/25/5 isolate is one of several isolates including
FVO, FCR3, and Palo Alto that appear to have a common
genetic origin due to a laboratory cross-contamination
event [34].
Long PCR amplification of var gene sequences
Larger var gene PCR products were amplified from
genomic DNA using previously described techniques
[49]. PCR primers (Additional file 4: Table S1) were
designed to the different types of var gene flanking
sequence or the relatively conserved var exon 2. These
primers were paired with gene-specific primers from small
sequence tags that had been amplified from internal
domains in IT4 PfEMP1 proteins [49]. PCR reactions were
done using TaKaRa LA Taq™ polymerase (Fisher) following the manufacturer's recommendations and supplied
buffer. 50 ul reactions containing 50 ng template, 1×
buffer, 0.4 mM dNTPs (each), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5 µM
primers, and 2.5 U enzyme were run in a DNA Engine
Dyad™ Peltier Thermal Cycler from MJ Research. PCR conditions were 1 cycle of 94°C for 1 min followed by 35
cycles of 98°C for 1 min, primer annealing temperature
for 1 min, and an extension temperature of 62–68°C for
8–18 min. Primer annealing temperatures were 0–5
degrees lower the TMs listed in Additional file 4: Table S1.
Sequencing was performed on PCR products that were
directly hydosheared and cloned into a sequencing vector
or were first cloned into the pCR®4-TOPO vector from Invitrogen before hydoshearing and subcloning into the
sequencing vector. Sequences were assembled using the
PHRED/PHRAP/CONSED software suite [71]. To confirm
that recombination had not occurred during the PCR reaction or bacterial cloning, specific oligos were designed
along the length of var genes and independent PCR reactions were performed on genomic DNA.
Var gene chromosome assignation by pulsed field gel
IT4/FCR3 parasites were suspended in agarose blocks,
then the intact chromosomes were size-fractionated on
pulsed-field gels as described [72]. Gels were depurinated
for 10 min in 0.25 M HCl, rinsed, then capillary transferred to Hybond N+ (GE/Amersham) in 0.4 M NaOH.
Blots were hybridized at 50°C with DBLα tag probes corresponding to var genes IT4var1,IT4var5, IT4var25,
IT4var27,IT4var 29,IT4var33, IT4var60 and A4Tres, as
detailed previously [73]. Chromosome-central location of
IT4var1 and IT4var27 was confirmed by ApaI digestion
and size separation on pulsed-field gels, with hybridization to these tags at 60°C. Subtelomeric var genes lie on

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/45

relatively short ApaI fragments [53], and these two genes
are on large (> 400kbp) ApaI fragments.
Extraction of var gene sequences from public genome
project information
Var genes were identified in HB3 contigs downloaded
from the Plasmodium falciparum HB3 sequencing project,
Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT [30]. Contig assembly
1 was used, which contains approximately 10× genomic
coverage. To identify var genes, sequences were searched
for a common DBLα motif, DIGDI, using Artemis genome
viewer (Rutherford et al 2000). Var genes retrieved in this
manner were confirmed by comparison to results from
BLASTN with the full DBL1α sequence of PFA0005w, at
the Broad Institute malaria website. HB3 homologs for
var2csa were identified by BLASTN search at the same
website, using the 3D7 allele. HB3 pseudovar genes were
not confirmed by reamplification, but had approximately
the same level of sequence coverage as other var genes (8–
10×). Where possible, the var gene chromosomal context
was also noted, using %GC content graphs to locate both
telomeres and GC-rich DNA elements, which are short
sequences associated only with central var genes [74]. The
predicted HB3 chromosomal assignments were based
upon comparison to the 3D7 isolate using the NUCmer
program in MUMmer to identify sequence identities in var
gene flanking regions [75]. Sequence data for P. falciparum
3D7 var genes and unassembled IT4 var reads were
obtained from The Sanger Institute website [52]. Sequencing of P. falciparum IT4 is a component of the BioMalPar
Consortium. For the ACT comparisons, two new 3D7 var
genes are included, MAL7P1.212 and MAL8P1.220, which
appear in the latest annotation [52]. These are both the
most common type, Type 1, with UpsB type promoters,
bringing the total number of this type in 3D7 up to 40
(out of 61 var genes).
Sequence analysis
PfEMP1 domain classification was performed according
to previous criteria [10]. Neighbor-joining trees for all of
the domains and flanking regions were generated using
ClustalX for multiple alignments and PAUP*4.0b10 (*
Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony and other methods) [76]. Bootstrap analysis was performed with 1000
replicates. Gap opening and gap extension penalties of 5.0
and 0.05 or 10 and 0.1 were used for amino acid and DNA
alignments, respectively. Percentage sequence identities of
DBL, CIDR, and C2 domains were calculated using the
algorithm in DNAStar MEGALIGN, version 5.0 based
upon a ClustalW alignment. Means and standard deviations of these percentages were calculated and plotted in
Excel.

Dotplot analysis was performed on concatemers of the
variable extracellular region (exon1) sequences ordered

Page 15 of 18
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2007, 8:45

by isolate and Ups type using the programs Megalign and
DSGene. A percent identity matrix was used for all parameters tested (window length and percent identity threshold). To visualize the alignment results at the level of
individual proteins, the output alignments from the dotplot were collected, and for each alignment, the aa positions of the alignment and Ups category of the pair of
proteins were determined. For each aa position, the
number of "alignment hits" from each Ups category was
counted and plotted along the length of individual proteins. Microsoft Excel was used to generate plots of the
number of hits from 3D7 PfEMP1 proteins of the different
Ups types along the length of individual proteins for both
IT4 and 3D7 PfEMP1 proteins. Based upon the distribution of var genes in the 3D7 isolate, the maximum
number of hits at individual amino acid positions for
genes of each promoter type is UpsA (9), UpsB (22), UpsC
(13), UpsA2 (formerly UpsD; 1), UpsE (1), and UpsB2-4
(13, based upon previous published 2000 bp tree) [6,12].
The Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT) was used to view
exon1 for IT4, 3D7 and HB3 var genes. For each genome,
a concatemer of var exon1 nucleotide sequences (from the
start ATG to the splice donor site) was created. Sequences
were organized by Ups group, and a string of 30 N's
placed between each exon1 pair to clarify gene borders.
Local BLASTN, (word length 90 nucleotides, filter for low
complexity removed) was performed in all possible combinations between IT, 3D7 and HB3 var exon1 concatemers. These comparisons were then viewed with ACT
[56,77], with different window sizes (90 to 510 nucleotides), 90% minimum identity, and self-matches
removed.
