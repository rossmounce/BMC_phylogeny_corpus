Abstract
Background: Clostridium difficile is a Gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium that is responsible for C.
difficile associated disease in humans and is currently the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhoea in the western
world. This current status has been linked to the emergence of a highly virulent PCR-ribotype 027 strain. The aim of this
work was to identify regions of sequence divergence that may be used as genetic markers of hypervirulent PCRribotype 027 strains and markers of the sequenced strain, CD630 by array comparative hybridisation.
Results: In this study, we examined 94 clinical strains of the most common PCR-ribotypes isolated in mainland Europe
and the UK by array comparative genomic hybridisation. Our array was comprehensive with 40,097 oligonucleotides
covering the C. difficile 630 genome and revealed a core genome for all the strains of 32%. The array also covered genes
unique to two PCR-ribotype 027 strains, relative to C. difficile 630 which were represented by 681 probes. All of these
genes were also found in the commonly occuring PCR-ribotypes 001 and 106, and the emerging hypervirulent PCRribotype 078 strains, indicating that these are markers for all highly virulent strains.
Conclusions: We have fulfilled the aims of this study by identifying markers for CD630 and markers associated with
hypervirulence, albeit genes that are not just indicative of PCR-ribotype 027 strains. We have also extended this study
and have defined a more stringent core gene set compared to those previously published due to the comprehensive
array coverage. Further to this we have defined a list of genes absent from non-toxinogenic strains and defined the
nature of the specific toxin deletion in the strain CD37.
Background
Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a Gram-positive,
spore-forming, anaerobic bacterium currently responsible for virtually all cases of pseudomembranous colitis
(PMC) and for 10-25% of cases of antibiotic-associated
diarrhoea [1]. The organism is resistant to various antibiotics and capitalizes on the ensuing disruption of the normal intestinal flora to colonization and cause disease. The
spectrum of disease ranges from asymptomatic carriage
to a fulminant, relapsing, and increasingly fatal colitis [2].
The effects of C. difficile infection (CDI) are devastating,
both in terms of morbidity and mortality and the high
costs of disease management [3,4]. Once regarded as rela* Correspondence: nigel.minton@nottingham.ac.uk

tively uncommon, there has been an upward trend in the
incidence of CDI in both North America [1,5,6] and
Europe [7,8] culminating in 2007 in over 5 times as many
deaths (8,324) than MRSA (1,593) in England and Wales
[9].
Various reasons have been suggested for this extraordinary rise in incidence and mortality, including the emergence of so-called 'hypervirulent' strains. The most
prominent such strains belong to PCR-ribotype 027,
responsible in North America for a 5-fold increase in the
historical average of CDI, more severe disease, higher
relapse rates, increased mortality, and greater resistance
to fluoroquinolone antibiotics [10]. Although restriction
endonuclease analysis (REA) and multilocus variable
number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) have greater
powers of discrimination [11], PCR-ribotyping [12,13],
represents the most widely used method of distinguishing
strains, and relies on the use of specific primers comple-

mentary to the 3' end of the 16S rRNA gene and to the 5'
end of the 23S rRNA gene to amplify the variable-length
intergenic spacer region. The fragments generated are
analysed electrophoretically, and the size distribution of
fragments obtained compared to reference patterns.
Presently upwards of 150 PCR-ribotypes are recognised
[14].
Typically, PCR-ribotype 027 strains (also characterised
as toxinotype III, North American pulsed field gel electrophoresis type 1, NAP1, and restriction endonuclease
analysis group BI) possess a binary toxin gene and encode
a variant TcdC repressor protein suggested to account for
increased toxin production [15,16]. Current PCR-ribotype 027 strains have, since the first documented isolate
[17], acquired resistance to fluoroquinolone and erythromycin antibiotics [18-20], and their occurrence is often
associated with an excessive use of quinolone antibiotics.
The speed with which PCR-ribotype 027 can become
predominant is exemplified by events in the UK where its
incidence increased from virtually zero over the period
1990 to 2005 [21], to 25.9% through the period 2005 to
2007 [22] to 41.4% across England over the period April
2007 to March 2008 [23]. However, whilst PCR-ribotype
027 strains have received much attention, other strains
may also present an equivalent threat in terms of disease
severity. In many countries, different PCR-ribotypes can
predominate, but be extremely rare elsewhere. For
instance, the PCR-ribotype 106, although common in the
UK [22], was entirely absent from the European study of
Barbut et al. [24]. In the Netherlands, PCR-ribotype 078
increased from 3% to 13% over the period February 2005
to February 2008, infected younger individuals than PCRribotype 027 and was more frequently involved in community-associated disease [25]. Human PCR-ribotype
078 isolates possess a number of features in common
with PCR-ribotype 027 and have recently been shown to
be genetically related to isolates from pigs [26].
Currently, the overall reason why particular strains
achieve epidemic status is unclear. Although some suggestions have been made [27], in terms of altered toxin
production, presence of binary toxin, changes in antibiotic susceptibility and sporeogenesis, the situation is
likely to be more complex involving a number of different
phenotypic traits. A previous comparative phylogenomic
study using microarrays based only on those genes present in the annotated genome sequence of a PCR-ribotype
012 strain, CD630 [28,29] [GenBank: AM180355.1]),
showed that the PCR-ribotype 027 strains tested formed
a tight clade, which was distinct from the other 56 strains
analyzed and confirmed the clonal nature of PCR-ribotype 027 strains, but indicated extensive variation in the
genetic content [29]. A further study microarray study
included extra genes from the Canadian PCR-ribotype

strain,

[30]
[Genbank:

AAML00000000]) where the conserved genetic core was
defined and divergent regions were conserved amongst
strains of the same host origin.
The aim of this current study was to identify unique
strain differences using a genome wide approach, with a
view to both gaining greater insight into enhanced virulence and as a means of identifying regions of sequence
divergence suitable for use as diagnostic indicators of
hypervirulence. To accomplish this, a DNA microarray
comprised of over 41000 oligonucleotides was designed
and constructed using in situ inkjet oligonucleotide synthesis. The strains represented included CD630, R20291
and QCD-32g58. The strains subjected to comparative
genomic hybridisation were chosen as they represented
the most prevalent PCR-ribotypes from the UK and EU
[2,22]. The work presented in this study represents the
application of a novel microarray format to the study of
comparative genomic hybridisation and is the only study
that employs the widely used molecular typing technique
of ribotyping to choose the strains for hybridisation and
for subsequent clustering analysis.

Results
Array verification and coverage

Forty thousand and ninety seven 60-mer probes were
designed to cover the sequenced and annotated genome
of C. difficile CD630. This essentially corresponded to a
probe every approximately 200 bp. A further 687 probes
were designed to extra genes in the preliminary 454
sequence produced for R20291 by the Sanger in 2007 and
the available unannotated QCD-32g58 sequence. Additionally, 17 extra genes including the toxin genes, cwp66
and slpA were represented at high density by 346 oligonucleotides. Initial experiments were performed with a set
of control strains that included CD630, R20291, R23052
and CD196 (R12087). A CD630 self-self hybridisation
was also performed. Analysis of the data obtained showed
that the genome of strain CD630 hybridised to 57 of the
'027-specific' probes; and a BLASTN in silico analysis of
the array oligonucleotides against the CD630, R20291
and QCD-32g58 sequences used to design the array
showed that these oligonucleotides had highly significant
matches in these strains. Accordingly, these oligonucleotides were excluded from further analysis.
Analysis of the remaining PCR-ribotype 027 oligonucleotides with genomic DNA of the control strains
showed that these probes produced a positive signal with
the DNA of PCR-ribotype 027 strains. Figure 1 shows a
condition tree clustering for all the strains against all of
the probes, with those representing CD0001 listed at the
top, pCD630, the extra genes and finally the extra PCRribotype 027 genes at the bottom. Strains are grouped by
PCR-ribotype and, on initial inspection, demonstrate that
each PCR-ribotype exhibits a visually similar pattern of

Figure 1 Comparative genomic analysis of 94 strains of clinical strains of C. difficile. The probes were arranged by their corresponding C. difficile
630 gene, with CD0001 at the top and CD3680 at the bottom, followed by CDS from the plasmid pCD630 (CDP01 to CDP11) and finally probes representing the genes unique to ribotype 027. Each column represents an isolate, and each row corresponds to a probe. The status of each probe is
indicated by color as follows: red, present/conserved in the test strain; blue, absent in the test strain and yellow present in both the test and control

hybridisation. Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 presents a full list of the probes that are present or absent in
each strain.
Core

The core gene list was established by examining CD630
probes present and at a 1:1 ratio for each strain. Analysis
of the core genes for all the strains tested showed that
32% of CD630 probes were conserved (12788/40097).
This percentage is higher than those previously published
in other array studies of 19.7% [29] and 16% [30]. This is
perhaps surprising due to the wide variety of PCR-ribotypes analysed but as this array is denser, containing more
than one reporter element per gene, greater sequence
conservation will be evident than for arrays with one
reporter per gene. Therefore, genes such as slpA which
may not be included in the previously reported core percentages would be represented in this current figure. Our
array also covers intergenic regions not covered by lower
density microarrays. Conservation of genes was seen

amongst all functional categories (see Additional file 9).
Even greater conservation was seen when comparing
strains of the same PCR-ribotype and Table 1 indicates
the percentage conservation amongst the studied PCRribotypes, with a conservation of 85% or more for PCRribotypes 003, 012, 014 and 020.
Mobile elements

C. difficile is known to have a highly mosaic genome with
many mobile genetic elements such as conjugative transposons and prophages [28]. Of the 1392 probes representing mobile or extrachromosomal elements in strain
CD630, only 92 probes were present in the core of all the
strains hybridised. Additional file 10 summarises the
presence of the known CD630 mobile elements in each
PCR-ribotype. In the majority of PCR-ribotype 027 and
001 strains, CTn1 is absent or highly divergent. It is
absent or highly divergent in all PCR-ribotype 078 and
015 strains. CTn2 is absent from all of the PCR-ribotypes
except from the PCR-ribotype 12 strains, CD630 and

ECDC 012. CTn3 is absent or highly divergent from all
PCR-ribotypes except 078 and 012. CTn3 or Tn5397 is
the only known mobile C. difficile element containing
erythromycin and tetracycline resistance [31]. Therefore
resistance to these antibiotic classes in any of the strains
tested, including R20291 and PCR-ribotypes 078 and 106
strains (which are resistant to erythromycin) must be
provided by an as yet undefined genetic element or mutation [32,33].
CTn4 is detectable in the PCR-ribotype 027 Quebec
strain 23M63 but is absent or highly divergent in 27/28 of
the PCR-ribotype 027 strains tested on the array utilised
in this study. It is also partially present in one of the PCRribotype 001 strains tested but absent from all the other
PCR-ribotypes. CTn5 is absent or highly divergent in 6
PCR-ribotypes; 001, 002, 014, 015 003 and 020. In all
PCR-ribotype 017 strains only genes CD1864-9 are
absent or highly divergent. These genes are also absent or
highly divergent in 1-2 strains of the remaining 3 PCRribotypes; 027, 078 and 106. One PCR-ribotype 014 strain
exhibits hybridisation between CD3330-44, but CTn6 is

absent or highly divergent in all the other strains tested.
Conversely Ctn7 is present in some form in all PCR-ribotypes except PCR-ribotypes 002 and 015. Prophage 1 is
absent from all the strains tested except the PCR-ribotype
012 strains. Prophage 2 hybridises between CD2927-59 in
all but PCR-ribotype 001, 002, 014, 015 and 078 strains.

Virulence genes
Various genetic loci that have been implicated in the virulence and pathogenesis of C. difficile, including those
encoding for toxins and putative adhesions, as well as factors responsible for the spread of C. difficile, such as flagella and motility genes, antibiotic resistance and
regulatory genes.
Toxins

The C. difficile genome contains the PaLoc (pathogenicity
locus) which harbours five genes (tcdABCDE) responsible
for the synthesis and regulation of the two major virulence factors, toxins, TcdA and TcdB. Variation in this
region is extensive and as a consequence toxinotyping is a
frequently used molecular method used to discriminate
between strains [34,35]. Variable sequences include both
the structural genes encoding the toxins, and the associated regulatory genes. Thus, the ability of some PCRribotype 027 strains to produce more of both toxins is
attributed to a deletion at position 117 in the negative
regulator of toxin production, tcdC [15,16], leading to a
truncated TcdC protein. The occurrence of similar deletions in other strains not generally associated with epidemics suggests, however, that such changes are not
indicative of hypervirulence [20]. PCR-ribotype 027
strains are usually toxinotype III strains, whereas CD630
is toxinotype 0.
The array results confirm that tcdB is conserved among
all PCR-ribotype 027 isolates examined and diverged in
the 3' region of tcdC (the negative regulator of toxin production) as indicated by a lack of hybridisation to
EXP_CD630_800001_805000_s_PSO-60-77, the last tcdC
probe on the array. Naturally occurring toxin A-B+
strains cause diarrhoea and colitis in humans [36] and are
generally PCR-ribotype 017 (toxinotype VIII). From the
observed hybridisation obtained with our array, all of the
PCR-ribotype 017 strains examined here lacked tcdA and
exhibited divergence in tcdB when compared to the corresponding CD630 and SM probes (data not shown).
Some C. difficile strains also produce a third toxin in
addition to TcdA and TcdB, a binary ADP-ribosyltransferase toxin encoded by cdtA and cdtB. The role of binary
toxin in pathogenesis is unclear, although it has been
linked to increased disease severity [2]. The genes cdtA
and cdtB are conserved in PCR-ribotypes 027 and 078.
Our hybridisation results agree with those previously
reported for CD630, showing divergence in both of these

Marsden et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:389
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/389

genes which cause these genes not to be active in this
strain [37]. PCR-ribotype 017 also displays similar results
to previous publications and, shows limited hybridisation
to some CD630 cdtA and cdtB reporters as concluded by
Rupnik [35]. The results from this study for the other
PCR-ribotypes examined show that this region is divergent.
Flagella and motility genes

Flagella are important in pathogenesis for many enteric
pathogens including Campylobacter jejuni and Salmonella enterica serovar Enteridis [38,39]. Chemotaxis and
motility are inextricably linked and both are important
for bacterial survival allowing the bacteria to move
towards nutrients and away from substances that may
prove detrimental.
Genes that allow for flagella modification by glycosylation have recently been described in C. difficile QCD32g58 and R20291 upstream of the flagellar biosynthesis
locus [32,40]. Reporters representing 2 of the 4 loci
(CDR0223 and 5) are present on the array and are conserved in all strains but two PCR-ribotype 017 strains
(L22 and 23). Stabler et al [32] described the flagella
related genes in 2 loci of the CD630 genome, F1;
CD0226-40 and F3; CD0245-71 [29]. Loss of, or significant divergence in the F1 and inter-flagella region (F2;
CD0241-4) was observed in PCR-ribotype 027 strains;
this was shown to be due to 84-90% sequence identity in
this region [32].
Our data shows that only 7/93 strains are divergent in
these genes and this includes the two PCR-ribotype 017
strains discussed above, two non-toxigenic strains and
two PCR-ribotype 078 strains. PCR-ribotype 078 strains
have previously been reported to be non-motile [32] and
although the CD630 flagella loci appears to be highly
divergent or absent in these stains, the corresponding
R20291 flagella and flagella glycosylation genes are present, indicating that another mechanism of variation is
responsible for their non-motility.
Antibiotic resistance

Another contributing factor to the spread of C. difficile
infection is the acquisition of antibiotic resistance. The
genome sequence of CD630 allowed the identification of
many genes associated with antibiotic resistance, including those already known such as ermB and tetM, and
those with no prior experimental data, such as the putative lantibiotic antibiotic resistance genes (CD0478CD0482, CD0820-CD0824 and CD1349-CD1352). In
contrast to strain CD630, the epidemic 027 strains have
been shown to be highly resistant to fluoroquinolones
due to point mutations in the DNA gyrase genes which
cannot be detected by this microarray [4,29].

Page 5 of 16

In agreement with previous array data, the lantibiotic
resistance loci, CD0643-6 and CD01349-52 are absent or
highly divergent in all the PCR-ribotype 078 strains
tested and appear to be divergent in some of the tested
PCR-ribotype 027 strains. The putative ABC transporter
that confers daunorubicin resistance (CD0456) was
absent from PCR-ribotype 078, 106 and 020 strains, but
present in all others. The R20291 sequence showed that
chloramphenicol resistance was conferred by CDR3461,
part of the CTn027. The array shows that this gene or its
homologue is present in all of our PCR-ribotype 027 and
001 strains, present in the majority of PCR-ribotype 078
strains and divergent in the remaining PCR-ribotype
strains.
Regulatory systems

Regulatory genes form a large part of the C. difficile
genome comprising 11% of the CD630 genome [28]. In
Staphylococcus aureus, the agr quorum sensing locus
(agrCABD) has been implicated as a key regulator of
many virulence factors [41,42]. In strain CD630 only
homologues of agrD and agrB were present, respectively
encoding a prepeptide of a secreted small autoinducer
peptide and a transmembrane protein involved in AgrD
processing. The homologous system in S. aureus also
contains two further genes; agrC and agrA encoding a
two-coponent system. Preliminary 454 sequencing of the
PCR-ribotype 027 had shown that R20291 contained a
second complete copy of an agr locus (agrCABD) in addition to the agrBD genes of strain CD630. Accordingly, oligonucleotides corresponding to this extra agrCABD locus
was incorporated on our array at high density with an
additional 25 probes.
Hybridisation against our array demonstrated that the
extra agrCABD locus found in R20291 is entirely present
in the genomes of 82 of the 94 (86%) strains tested,
including two of four non-toxigenic strains (Figure 2).
Additional file 11 details the presence, absence and divergence (signal around 1) for each probe in the remaining
12 strains. The hybridisation to a few probes by DNA isolated from each of these 12 strain implies that this region
is divergent rather than absent. PCR primer walking was
performed on the strains detailed in Additional file 12
and primers were designed to the region CDR3184-3190.
These primers generated amplicons of the expected size
when DNA was derived from the positive control,
R20291. No such amplicons were generated when DNA
was derived from the 12 test strains. The positive control
primers designed to amplify CDR3190 produced an
amplicon with DNA isolated from all strains (data not
shown). Overall, these results indicate that the absence of
this additional agrCABD locus is the exception, rather
than the rule.

Other virulence factors

The ability to sporulate is an important mechanism for
the dissemination of all clostridia. A recent study has suggested that epidemic PCR-ribotype 027 isolates are more
prolific in terms of spore formation than non-epidemic
strains [43]. The sporulation related genes represented on
the array are conserved throughout all the strains tested.
Another set of genes that have been implicated in virulence are those encoding cell surface proteins, including
Cwp84 [44]. The majority of the genes coding for cell surface proteins are conserved in all of the strains tested.
The genes which appear to show divergence are cwp66,
CD2791 and CD3392.

Non toxigenic strains
In order to provide further validation of the array, the
DNA of a total of four non-toxigenic strains (CD37,
ATCC 43593 (1351), ATCC BAA-1801 (3232) and ATCC
43501 (7322)), were hybridised to the array. Braun et al
[45] defined the integration site for the pathogenicity
locus (PaLoc) by the sequence-based comparison of toxigenic strains and non-toxinogenic strains. Included in
this analysis were the three ATCC non-toxigenic strains
43593, 43501 and BAA-1801. The C. difficile strain CD37
has previously been described as non-toxigenic but the
nature of the deletion never fully characterised [46]. As
shown in Figure 3, the PaLoc is absent from all four nontoxigenic strains at the site determined by Braun et al
[45]. In these strains, the cdu1 gene is adjacent to the
cdd1 gene and this was confirmed using the multiplex
PCR and primers described by Braun et al., [45] (data not
shown).
Further analysis of the non-toxigenic strains was performed and showed that 71 genes were absent or highly
divergent from all of these strains compared to CD630
and 15 of the R20291 extra genes were also absent or
highly divergent (detailed in Additional file 13). These
genes include coding sequences (CDS) in the conjugative
transposons CTn2 and CTn6. Two of the strains have
additionally lost, or are highly divergent in, the flagella
genes CD0226-40 and the R20291 flagella F2 region
CDR0242-7.
Discussion
The microarray used in the current study was designed to
cover one sequenced strain of C. difficile (CD630), and
the preliminary unannotated sequence from two different
PCR-ribotype 027 strains, R20291 (based on a 454
sequence run available at ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/
pathogens/cd/C_difficile_Bi_454.dbs) and QCD-32g58.
Since the microarray was designed in 2007, the fully
annotated sequence of R20291 [EMBL: FN545816],
together with the historical PCR-ribotype 027 strain

Page 6 of 16

CD196 [EMBL: FN538970], has been published [32].
Comparison of the 027-specific probes on the microarray
to the published sequence of R20291 has revealed some
differences. In particular, a total of 234 additional R20291
genes were described in comparison to the sequenced
strain CD630 and 505 genes were found to be unique to
CD630. The array used in our study covers 169 of the 234
additional genes (72.2%). The missing CDS are detailed in
Table 2. The majority of genes not represented on the
array are transposon or phage related (40 genes) and the
remaining 25 genes have oligonucleotide reporters representing neighbouring genes on the array.
During the gap closure sequencing and subsequent
analysis of the R20291 and CD196 genomes, 47 extra
genes were found in strain R20291 compared to the historical strain CD196. This included a unique 20 Kb phage
island, termed SMPI1 which was found to be inserted
into a unique PCR-ribotype 027 conjugative transposon,
named CTn027. Our array was designed prior to gap closure of these 2 genomes and as a consequence represents
only 29.8% of the 47 additional genes found in the R20291
genome. The majority of the genes not represented by the
array form part of the conjugative transposon, CTn027,
which is unique to R20291. However, the 14 CTn027
genes that are represented by our array were found to be
present in the genomes of only 5 of the 28 PCR-riboytpe
027 strains tested, thereby indicating that this transposon
is not common amongst PCR-riboytpe 027 strains.
The tiling nature of our array has established a more
stringent and definitive core gene or sequence list than
those previously published. Analysis of the core genes for
all the strains tested showed that 32% of CD630 probes
were conserved (12788/40097). This percentage is higher
than those previously published in other array studies of
19.7% [32] and 16% [30]. The high density of our array,
the fact that there is more than one reporter per gene and
the coverage of intergenic regions means that our array
provides a greater ability to define the core genes or
sequences in each strain than PCR-spotted or single
reporter per gene arrays. Conservation of genes was seen
amongst all functional categories (Additional file 9).
As expected even greater conservation was seen when
comparing strains of the same PCR-ribotype. Table 1
indicates the percentage conservation amongst the studied PCR-ribotypes, with conservation of 85% or more for
PCR-ribotypes 003, 012, 014 and 020 in comparison to
strain CD630. However, three of these ribotypes were
only represented by one isolate and the study would have
to be extended to include more isolates to provide a real
indication of conservation among ribotypes 003, 012 and
020. Our array confirmed divergence between strains
within the toxin encoding regions between PCR-ribotypes, particularly in the case of tcdB and cdtAB, while at

the same time demonstrated that the particular tcdB variant present in R20291 was conserved amongst all PCRribotype 027 isolates tested.
Examination of the conjugative transposons in different
PCR-ribotypes of C. difficile shows that the pattern of
hybridisation to the probes representing the mobile elements provides only a limited indication of PCR-ribotype. Thus, while the majority of PCR-ribotype 106
strains lack any sequences homologous to CTn5, one
strain (L25) does carry CTn5-derived sequences. Many
strains showed homology to the genes at the terminal
ends of the transposons. Whilst this could be because

these genes are common to many transposons, genes
such as CD3325 and CD3349 of CTn6 are present in all
the strains tested even though the occurrence of the
whole tranposon is limited to CD630 and one PCR-ribotype 014 strain. The two single PCR-ribotype 003 and
015, and the eight PCR-ribotype 002 strains appear particularly devoid of homology to the specific transposons
and prophages probes present on the array. The elements
tested appear completely absent from six of the eight
PCR-ribotype 002 strains, as well as the single PCR-ribotype 003 strain (aside from partial hybridisation to some
CTn1 probes), and PCR-ribotype 015 strain (aside from

partial hybridisation to some prophage 2 probes). Two of
the PCR-ribotype 002 strains carry some regions with
limited homology to parts of prophage 2.
A major aim of the study was to determine whether it
was possible to identify divergent sequences that may be
characteristic of either PCR-ribotype 027, or indeed
hypervirulence. Seventeen of the 537 PCR-ribotype 027
probes represented on the microarray were present in all
of the strains (Table 3). In silico analysis showed that
these matches were not expected against the available
non-027 nucleotide sequences. Determination of hypervirulent sequence markers to separate PCR-ribotype 027
strains from the rest of the strains was not possible. All of
the 027 genes represented by the 027 probes were present
in at least one strain of PCR-ribotypes 001, 020, 078 and
106. Table 4 details the percentage of 027 probes present
in each PCR-ribotype. Additional file 14 details the 027
genes discovered by Stabler et al [32] absent from the
array design. Additional file 15 examines the probes

absent in each PCR-ribotype. Filtering was performed to
see if any elements on the array could be used to identify
individual PCR-ribotypes. No single probe was representative of just one PCR-ribotype.
It was noteworthy that the PCR-ribotype 020 reference
strain also shares the extra PCR-ribotype 027 genes.
PCR-ribotypes 020 and 014 are very difficult to differentiate by PCR-ribotyping and, therefore, frequently combined as "014/020 type". This 014/020 PCR-ribotype is
currently the most frequently found type in Europe. It is
remarkable, however, that type 014 differed considerably
from 020 by the presence of extra 027 genes, indicating
that the reference PCR-ribotype strains of 020 and 014
are clearly different. As only one reference strain of PCRribotype 020 was examined on the array, the possibility
that these 2 PCR-ribotypes may be distinguishable by the
presence or absence of the extra 027 genes needs to be
further examined. Our study further emphasised that the
extra copy of the Agr system (agrCABD) present in

R20291 [32], and absent in CD630, is present in the
majority of strains examined. It is, therefore, most likely
not associated with hypervirulence.
Another aim of this study was to determine sequences
that could be used to identify the strain CD630. The
pCD630 plasmid is only present in one other strain
(EK29). As detailed in Table 5, 81 CD630 genes are
absent, or highly divergent, from all other PCR-ribotypes
(except the PCR-ribotype 012 reference strain). Only the
mobile elements CTn5 and CTn7 do not have any CDS
on this list. The only genes which are not derived from
mobile elements on this list are CD0211-2, which encode
a CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase and a putative choline sulfatase, and CD2001, CD2003-5, encoding
2 conserved hypothetical proteins, an efflux pump and a
MarR transcriptional regulator. CD3136-8 and 3147-53
are included in this list as they are only present in 9 of the
94 strains tested.

Conclusions
C. difficile has become the most common cause of nosocomial diarrhoea in recent years, partly due to the emergence and spread of the hypervirulent PCR-ribotype 027.
The increasing rates of CDI are not only caused by the
spread of this PCR-ribotype, which remains the second
most commonly isolated PCR-ribotype in the UK and the
fourth most commonly isolated PCR-ribotype in Europe
[22,24].
This array comparative genomic study presents a snapshot of current EU clinical strains and the current molecular epidemiology of C. difficile [47]. Our study has
shown that the PCR-ribotype 027 markers absent in the
CD630 genome are not solely confined to PCR-ribotype
027 strains, but appear distributed amongst other PCRribotypes to varying degrees. Indeed, in some cases

(PCR-ribotype 001, 020 and 106) there is greater overall
carriage of these markers (100%) than amongst the PCRribotype 027 strains examined (98.8%). The apparent
lower carriage rate in the latter may in part be a reflection
of the larger sample size analysed (29 × 027) compared to
the other PCR-ribotypes (10 × 001, 17 × 106, 9 × 078 and
1 × 020). This does not rule out the possibility that some
of these markers may be indicative of increased virulence.
Thus, PCR-ribotype 001 is one of the commonest types
in Europe, and frequently associated with outbreaks,
PCR-ribotype 106 was until recently the epidemic strain
in England and Wales [22], whilst PCR-ribotype 078
strains are increasing recognised as being as equally

aggressive as PCR-ribotype 027 strains [25]. The presence
of markers of enhanced virulence common to 027 would,
is, therefore, not surprising.
Although comprehensive and of high density, the
microarray employed here is of limited utility value as it
does not cover all the extra PCR-ribotype 027 genes later
revealed by Stabler et al. [32]. The presence of such '027specific'genes in the PCR-ribotype 078, 001, 020 and 106
should be confirmed. However, as they largely represent
transposon-related genes, their usefulness as markers of
hypervirulence for diagnostics may be limited.
We have fulfilled the aims of this study by identifying
markers for CD630 and markers for hypervirluence,

albeit genes that are not just indicative of PCR-ribotype
027. As a consequence of our comprehensive array coverage, we have also defined a more stringent core gene set
compared to those previously published [30,32]. Further
to this, we have defined a list of genes absent from nontoxinogenic strains and defined the deletion in strain
CD37.

Methods
Strains and growth conditions

Ninety-four clinical strains were investigated in this study
and these included 29 PCR-ribotype 027 strains, 17 PCRribotype 106 strains, 10 PCR-ribotype 001 strains, 9 PCRribotype 078 strains, 8 PCR-ribotype 002 strains, 8 PCRribotype 017 strains and 7 PCR-ribotype 014 strains
(Additional file 16). Four non-toxigenic strains were also
hybridised to the array for further investigation. The
majority of the strains examined this study were isolated
in the UK or the Netherlands.
A 10 μl loop was used to inoculate pre-reduced BHIS
agar from frozen bacterial stock. The plates were then
incubated anaerobically at 37°C under an atmosphere of
N2:H2:CO2 (80:10:10, vol:vol:vol) in an anaerobic work-

Page 11 of 16

station (Don Whitley, Yorkshire, UK). A single colony
was then used to inoculate a 10 ml BHIS broth and incubated overnight prior to DNA extraction.
DNA Extraction

A traditional DNA extraction method utilising phenol
chloroform extraction was used [48]. Briefly, overnight
cultures were pelleted and the cells were resuspended in
260 μl buffer EB (Qiagen). After the addition of 20 mg/ml
lysozyme (Sigma-Aldrich, Gillingham, Dorset, UK) and
10% SDS (Sigma-Aldrich, U.K.), the solution was incubated at 37°C for 1 hour. The solution was then incubated
for a further hour with 100 mg/ml DNase free RNase
(Roche, Burgess Hill, U.K.) and Proteinase K (20 mg/ml;
Qiagen, Crawley, West Sussex, U.K.). DNA was extracted
by phenol:chloroform:IAA (Sigma-Aldrich) washes and
phase-lock gel (5 Prime, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). The
genomic DNA was then precipitated using ice-cold 100%
ethanol and sodium acetate and purified with two washes
of 70% ethanol. Purity and quantity were assessed using a
NanoDrop1000 spectrophotometer (Thermofisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and visualisation by gel electrophoresis. Genomic DNA used for hybridisation to the
microarray was fragmented by sonication and the fragment size was examined by gel electrophoresis.
Array design

The array was designed to cover the previously
sequenced strain C. difficile 630, the preliminary 454
sequence data of the 027 strain R20291 and the unannotated sequence of the Canadian 027 isolate QCD32g58 in
a strategy similar to that used by Witney et al [49]. The
R20291 genome sequence was generated by 454/Roche
GS20 as discussed in Stabler et al [32]. Genome annotation of strain R20291 and QCD32g58 was based on previously published annotations of C. difficile strain 630 [17].
The genomic sequences were compared against the database of strain 630 proteins by blastx, and a CDS feature in
the query genome was created when a hit of over 90%
identity was found. Glimmer3 was used to predict CDSs
in genomic regions where no significant hits were found
[50]. Any unique genomic regions left were examined and
annotated manually in Artemis [51]. The genome comparisons were visualized in Artemis and ACT (Artemis
Comparison Tool; [52]. In silico comparison against the
Canadian strain QCD32g58 was also performed.
Probes were firstly designed to the CD630 genome and
then additional genes of interest from other strains
(R20291 and Quebec) were included. The CD630 portion
of the array had a tiling design. For this, the genome was
divided into 5 Kb segments with the aim of producing the
best probe for each 100 bp of sequence. All possible 60
mers were considered and ranked on the basis of melting
temperature, likelihood of secondary structure and GC
content. The highest ranking probe per 100 bp was then

Where possible the 3 highest ranking probes were then
selected. Sometimes 3 probes per gene were not possible
due to gene length or homology. The array design was

completed using the Agilent eArray interactive website.

Using this method 40, 0097 oligonucleotides were
designed to cover the CD630 genome. A further 681
probes covered any extra genes found in R20291 or
QCD32g58. Regions such as the PaLoc were also represented by 346 extra probes at higher density.
Array production

Our high density custom microarrays were printed using
an in situ inkjet oligonucleotide synthesizer by Agilent
Technologies (Stockport, Chesire [53]. The probes were
60 oligonucleotides in length and printed in single copy
per array. Four arrays were printed per slide.
Labelling and hybridisations

The genomic DNA was labelled using the Bioprime DNA
labelling system (Invitrogen, UK). Hybridizations were
performed, using SureHyb technology (Agilent, Stockport, Chesire, U.K.), with 2 μg of test genomic DNA
labelled with Cy5-dCTP and 2 μg Cy3-dCTP (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, UK) with labelled C. difficile 630
genomic DNA as a common reference. The labelled DNA
was purified using a MiniElute kit (Qiagen, Crawley, W.
Sussex, UK) and the extent of Cy dye incorporation was
measured using a nanodrop spectrophotometer. The test
and control DNA were combined in a final volume of 39
μl and at a concentration of 2 μg each. To this mixture
10× Oligo aCGH/ChIP-on-Chip Blocking agent and 2×
Hi-RPM hybridisation buffer (Agilent Technologies,
U.K.) were added. The solutions were then denatured at
95°C, and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. The microarray
was hybridized overnight using a SureHyb chamber at
65°C for 24 h. Slides were washed once in pre-heated
Oligo aCGH/ChIP-on-chip Wash Buffer 1 for 5 min and
briefly in Oligo aCGH/ChIP-on-chip Wash Buffer 2.
Microarrays were scanned using an Axon 4000b array
scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and
intensity fluorescence data acquired using GenePix Pro
(Molecular Devices).
Technical replicates were performed with our control
strains CD630 (self-self hybridisation), R20291 and
CD196, and this included dye-swap experiments. No replicates were performed for the clinical strains tested.
Microarray data analysis

The data was normalized and analysed using GeneSpring
GX version 7.3 (Agilent Technologies, UK). Initially for
each spot, the median pixel intensity for the local background was subtracted from the median pixel intensity of
the spot, and any values less than 0.01 were adjusted to
0.01. Background-subtracted pixel intensities for the test
strain channel were divided by those for the reference
strain channel. The resulting log ratios were normalised
by applying Per Spot Per Chip normalization, using 50%
of data from that chip as the median.

An arbitrary cut-off of twofold was used to identify
those genes that are specific to one of the strains. Therefore, for all strains, the upper cut-off was set at a ratio of 2
and the lower cut-off at a ratio of 0.5. Genes with a ratio
greater than the upper cut-off were deemed to be specific
to the test strain, genes with a ratio less than the lower
cut-off were deemed to be specific to the reference strain,
and genes with ratios between 0.5 and 2 were deemed to
be present in both strains. Previous studies have shown
that using arbitrary twofold cut-offs to determine presence or absence of genes is more conservative than other
methods such as GACK or standard deviation from the
median [48]. The presence or absence of a sequence was
based on the presence or absence of one probe. The presence of absence of a gene was based on the presence or
absence of more than one probe.
PCR amplification

PCR amplifications were performed using primers
described in Supplementary Table 7 and KOD Hot start
DNA polymerase (Novagen, Merck Chemicals, UK).
Reactions were performed using a denaturation step at
95°C followed by 30 cycles at 95°C for 30 seconds, 52°C
for 1 minute, 72°C for 2 - 7 minutes, followed by a final
extension of 72°C for 5- 7 minutes. PCRs used to define
the PaLoc used the primers and reaction conditions as
described by Braun et al [45]. PCR primer walking used
to confirm the results for the second agr locus were performed using the same polymerase as above, with annealing temperatures of 55°C. PCR products were analysed
on 1% or 3% agarose gels run at 100-150 mV for 1 hour
and stained with ethidium bromide.
Microarray data accession number

Fully annotated microarray data has been deposited in
ArrayExpress (E-MTAB-162).
