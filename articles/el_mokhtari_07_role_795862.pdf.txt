Abstract
Background: Bacterial DNA has been repeatedly detected in atheromatous lesions of coronary
heart disease (CHD) patients. Phylogenetic signatures in the atheroma lesions that are similar to
those of bacterial biofilms on human barrier organs, including the respiratory or gastrointestinal
tract, raise the question of a defective barrier function in CHD. NOD2 plays a major role in defense
against bacterial invasion. Genetic variation in the CARD15 gene, which encodes NOD2, was
previously shown to result in a barrier defect that causes chronic inflammatory disorders (e.g.
Crohn disease). In the present study, we investigated the possible involvement of NOD2/CARD15
in the pathology of CHD by i) analyzing the local expression of NOD2 in atherectomy versus
healthy tissue (n = 5 each) using histochemical immunofluorescence and ii) by testing the three
major functional CARD15 variants (R702W, G908R and 1007fs) for association with early-onset
CHD in 900 German patients and 632 healthy controls.
Results: In atherectomy tissue of CHD patients, NOD2 was detected in inflammatory cells at the
luminal sides of the lesions. However, the allele and genotype frequencies of the three major
CARD15 polymorphisms did not differ between CHD patients and controls.
Conclusion: The NOD2 up-regulation in atheroma lesions indicates an involvement of this
protein in the pathology of CHD. Although NOD2 could be important in local immune response
mechanisms, none of the analyzed CARD15 variants seem to play a significant role in the etiology
of CHD.

Background
Over the last years, it has become apparent that inflammation is a driving factor in the pathophysiology of coronary
heart disease (CHD). Immune cells infiltrate the coronary
artery lesion, and their mediator molecules aggravate pro-

gression and activation of the atherosclerotic lesions [14]. The importance of elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) as
a negative prognostic marker of disease progression
underlines the role of inflammation as a pathogenic factor
[5]. There is increasing evidence from sero-epidemiologiPage 1 of 8

cal and animal studies that bacterial infection may be
involved in the pathophysiology of the local chronic
inflammatory process underlying atherosclerosis [6-9].
The initial observation of a specific infection with a single
pathogen, e.g. Chlamydia pneumoniae, was increasingly
challenged by new experimental findings demonstrating
the presence of a wide spectrum of bacteria in the atherosclerotic plaque [10]. The variety and composition of bacterial species are compatible with the bacterial flora of
human mucosal barriers [10,11], such as the oral cavity,
the gastrointestinal, and the respiratory tract. As bacteria
can translocate into the blood or lymph system from barrier organ surfaces, a secondary colonization of the
plaques has been suggested. Lethiniemi et al. recently proposed that the destroyed surface of atheromas might act as
mechanical sieves collecting bacteria from the circulation
[11]. Impairment of mucosal barriers could therefore be a
key factor in the pathogenesis of CHD as it allows bacteria
to invade from body surfaces into systemic circulation
and to colonize the atherosclerotic lesion.
Genetic factors that influence barrier function and immunological host responses to the microbial challenge may
be determinants of susceptibility to CHD. Mutations in
genes encoding components of the innate immune system that are involved in bacterial defense have been previously linked to the pathophysiology of CHD, as
demonstrated for toll-like receptors (TLR) [12,13]. The
TLR family represents a class of membrane-bound pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) capable of detecting
microbial components and products. Importantly, TLRs
and other PRRs recognize not only exogenous but also
endogenous ligands, for example the scavenger receptors
SR-A and CD36 as well as oxidatively modified LDL (oxLDL) or enzymatically-modified LDL(e-LDL) which are
major players in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis
[14,15]. The relevance of TLR function in atherosclerosis
is supported by the observation that a deletion of the
MyD88 gene, encoding a pivotal adaptor molecule in the
TLR signalling pathway, inhibits atherosclerosis in apoE-/mice [16].
Georges et al. investigated the impact of pathogen burden
in patients with CHD in relation to systemic inflammation and variation in cytokine genes [17]. The study
showed that CHD is associated with heightened systemic
antibody response to different pathogens. Interestingly,
the association between CHD and pathogen burden was
modulated by the IL6 -174C/G polymorphism, which
would result in a down-regulated immune activation and
lower CRP levels [17]. More recently, NOD1 and NOD2,
which are members of a nucleotide-binding- oligomerization-domain-leucin-rich-repeat (NOD-LRR) family of
proteins, were described as important intracellular PRRs
for bacterial cell wall proteins. NOD1 and NOD2 regulate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/76

activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) in human fibroblast and aortic endothelial cell lines in response to
Chlamydia pneumoniae, one of the most common bacterial
species detected in atherosclerotic plaques [18]. Furthermore, endothelial cells upregulate CARD15 /NOD2 in
response to stimuli known to promote expression of the
gene [19]. Fillon et al. reported that bacterial components
interact with NOD2 in the cytoplasma of endothelial cells
and cardiomyocytes [20].
Variants in CARD15, the gene encoding the NOD2 protein, are associated with Crohn disease (CD), a chronic
inflammatory disorder of the human intestine [21],
asthma and atopic eczema [22,23]. The three coding polymorphisms R702W, G908R and 1007fs in CARD15 all
affect the leucin-rich repeat sensor domains of the NOD2
protein and are the main genetic risk determinants for
CD. They are not in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with
each other (r2 values range between 0 and 0.002) and capture most of the positional information at the locus [24].
The variant protein fails to sense muramyl dipeptide
(MDP), a structure of bacterial cell walls, that normally
triggers activation of NFκB [25-27]. The exact nature of the
disease mechanism is not completely clear. Transgenic
mice that are either deficient for CARD15 or carry the
most common CD susceptibility allele, 1007fs, exhibited
a strongly disturbed activation of NF-κB activation in
response to MDP [26,27]. Moreover, NOD2 elicits a complex protective cellular program due to constitutive
expression of a subgroup of microbial peptides, known as
α- and β-defensins in humans, that have been shown to
be involved in the host response to commensal bacteria
[26,28].
In this study, atherosclerotic coronary lesions from
patients with CHD were examined for local expression of
NOD2 by immunostaining. As control material coronary
vessels from heart beating donors were used that showed
no macroscopic alterations of the vessel wall. Furthermore, we investigated the occurrence and frequencies of
the three most common polymorphisms in the CARD15
gene that are associated with mucosal barrier dysfunction
(R702W, G908R and 1007fs) in a sample of patients with
CHD (n = 900) and compared the results to those
obtained from healthy controls (n = 632).

Results
Expression of NOD2 in coronary arteries is mainly
localized in macrophages
Immunofluorescent staining of NOD2 in coronary arteries from five healthy controls (heart beating donors) and
five patients with macroscopically and microscopically
proven CHD showed the presence of NOD2 protein at
high staining intensities in atherosclerotic plaques, especially in areas infiltrated with inflammatory cells (Fig.

observed in the vicinity of the vascular lumen (Fig. 1C).
Double staining for NOD2 and cell-type specific markers
(Fig. 1C,D) indicated that NOD2 is also expressed by
CD68-positive macrophages in deeper layers of the intima

= 0.87 with 95% confidence interval ranging from 0.67 to
1.14). A power calculation revealed that given the sample
sizes and an average carrier risk factor frequency of 0.18,
we would be able to detect a variant with a relative risk of
1.46 (at a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80%).
In addition, logistic regression analysis, which facilitates
the adjustment of known CHD risk factors including gender, yielded no evidence for association (Table 2). Based
on these results, none of the analyzed CARD15 variants
seem to play a significant role in the etiology of CHD.

Functional CARD15 variants are not associated with CHD
A total of 900 German early-onset CHD patients and 632
healthy control individuals were subjected to analysis of
the CARD15 variants R702W, G908R and 1007fs. The
genotype distributions of all markers were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both cases and controls. Prior to risk
factor adjustment, there was no statistically significant difference between any of the three mutations and the CHD
phenotype, at the allele and genotype level (Table 1). Neither stratification by survival of myocardial infarction
revealed any significant association (Table 1). Since all
three CARD 15 variants are relatively rare, we compared
the frequencies of carriers (i.e. homozygote, heterozygote
and double heterozygote carriers of any of the three polymorphisms) between the CHD samples and the controls.
The carrier frequencies were not significantly different
between the two groups (0.170 vs. 0.190; odds ratio [OR]

Discussion
A wide spectrum of bacterial species has been detected in
atherosclerotic coronary lesions, most of them compatible with commensals on surfaces of human barrier organs
including the mucosa of the respiratory or gastrointestinal
tract and the skin [10]. In addition, pathogens of the respiratory tract (e.g. Chlamydia pneumoniae) or from the gingival (e.g. Porphyromonas gingivalis) are consistently found
in atheromas [29-31]. The inter-individual variation in
the bacterial colonization of atherosclerotic lesions, the
diversity of existing microbes, and the compatibility with
the constitution of the microflora on human barriers raise
the possibility that the pathophysiology of CHD could
involve a defect of innate immunity and, therefore, barrier
dysfunction. In this case, bacteria would be able to translocate from their natural habit in biofilms (e.g. on
mucosal surfaces) into systemic circulation and contrib-

ute to local inflammation through colonisation of atheromatous lesions. This hypothesis is supported by
epidemiologic findings that show association of rheumatoid arthritis, periodontitis and diabetes, in which an
increased permeability of the oral and intestinal mucosa
has been reported, with general atherosclerosis and CHD
[32-36].
Receptors for pathogen associated microbial patterns
(PAMPs) play a pivotal role in the innate immune
defense. Expression of TLRs in coronary artery lesions, in
particular TLR1, TLR2 and TLR4, is enhanced and appears
to be crucial for the regulation of inflammatory activity
and bacterial recognition in atheromas [12,13]. Edfeldt et
al. found significant association between TLR4 variants
and risk of myocardial infarction [13].
NOD2 is a major player in the host defense against bacterial invasion. Expression of NOD2, as an intracellular
receptor for bacterial cell wall proteins (specifically MDP),
is increased through TNF and IFN-gamma [25]. The
NOD2 protein contains two N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) as effector elements and NODLRRs as sensor domains for bacterial MDP. NOD2 is
expressed mainly by macrophages and dendritic cells, but
also by intestinal epithelial and endothelial cells [25-27].
In this study, we demonstrated that NOD2 is mainly
expressed in macrophages in coronary artery lesions, suggesting that NOD2 might modulate the local immune
response and infection control in atherosclerotic lesions.
These novel findings support the hypothesis that NOD2 is
not only a marker of general barrier dysfunction, but is
also one of the important local innate immunity players
in the atheroma lesion. As bacterial flora has been localized in atheroma tissue [10], NOD2 is likely involved in
specific defense function against bacterial invasion. Moreover, PRRs confront not only microbes but also modified
LDL, the most established risk factor for CHD [14]. A
genetic deficiency in NOD2 function could therefore contribute to disease progression due to modified reaction of
endogenous pathogens and/or sustain bacterial invasion

and permanent microbial colonization of the atherosclerotic lesion.
Three coding polymorphisms in the CARD15 gene,
R702W, G908R and 1007fs, confer most of the susceptibility to CD. Homozygosity and compound heterozygosity increase the risk of developing CD by as much as 40fold [21]. With examination of these three polymorphisms much of the LD-based positional information for
the CARD15 locus is captured [24]. The variants influence
the function of the C-terminal LRR of the NOD2 protein
as a sensor for MDP [25] and are likely to play a role in
other chronic inflammatory diseases of barrier organs,
including atopic eczema and asthma [22,23,37]. NOD2
dysfunction could therefore contribute to both, a dampened local reactivity of macrophages in CHD and an
increased permeability and leakiness of the gastrointestinal barrier, permitting an enhanced entry of bacteria into
systemic circulation [38]. In this study, the three main
functional CARD15 polymorphisms were investigated in
1532 German CHD patients and healthy controls. All
patients had an early onset of CHD (before age 55), and a
subset of 596 patients suffered myocardial infarction as
the severest phenotype of CHD. Case-control analysis
revealed no statistically significant differences in the allele
and genotype frequencies of the CARD15 variants. Neither did logistic regression analysis, which takes into consideration known CHD risk factors, yield evidence for
association. Similarly, our previously reported data
showed no significant association of CHD with functional
mutations in the CARD4 gene [39]. Our finding in the
present investigation is consistent with the results of a
recent study in which none of the three CARD15 coding
polymorphisms were found to influence the high rates of
atherosclerotic events after renal transplantation [40].

Conclusion
In the current study, we could demonstrate that NOD2 is
up-regulated in atheroma lesions in CHD. However,
genetic variants of CARD15 were not found to be associated with the disease in a large German sample of earlyonset CHD patients. Based on these results, a major

genetic contribution of CARD15 to the etiology of CHD
can be excluded. However, other barrier function genes
still remain important candidates for CHD susceptibility.

Methods
Recruitment of study participants
The "case" sample of 900 CHD patients comprised a population-representative collection of unrelated German
coronary heart disease patients with disease onset < 55
years. They were recruited from the county of SchleswigHolstein, the northernmost region in Germany through
the population-based PopGen biobank [39,41]. In the
recruitment area, all coronary angiograms of the five cardiac catheterization laboratories were screened. Study
subjects were required to have coronary catheterization
demonstrating significant CHD (at least a 70% stenosis in
one major epicardial coronary vessel). The majority of
subjects (90.3%) had a history of severe CHD and had
undergone coronary revascularization procedure (percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass
grafting). A subset of 596 individuals had suffered a myocardial infarction (Table 1). The patients were between 33
and 71 years of age at the time of recruitment (mean age:
54 years) and younger than 55 years at the time of disease
onset (mean age: 48 years). The gender proportions in the
entire sample were 83.7% males vs. 16.3% females. A total
of 632 healthy control individuals was also drawn from
the PopGen biobank [41]. The controls were residential in
the same geographic area ensuring a distribution of environmental CHD risk factors identical to those of the cases.
They were randomly identified through official population registries ("Einwohnermeldeamt"), were of German
ancestry (all had German parents) and ranged in age
between 48 and 77 years (mean age: 62 years). Information on the general health status and the physical risk factors of CHD, i.e. smoking, body mass index (BMI),
diabetes and high blood pressure, was obtained from a
questionnaire that was completed during medical consultation. A subsequent clinical check-up was additionally
performed. Furthermore, information on earlier CHD and
myocardial infarctions was noted. Individuals who
reported earlier CHD and/or myocardial infarctions were
not included in the study. All participants gave informed
consent prior to enrolment, and the Ethics Committee of
the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel
approved the study.
NOD2-immunostaining and fluorescence microscopy
Biopsies were embedded in cryomatrix and snap-frozen in
liquid nitrogen. Cryostat sections (8 µm thick) were thawmounted onto Superfrost™ slides, postfixed for 5 min in
acetone, airdried and stored at -20°C before further
processing. Two slides of each biopsy were stained with
hematoxylin-eosin for routine histological evaluation.
The other slides were permeabilized by incubation with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/8/76

0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), washed three times in PBS and blocked with 0.75%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS for 20 minutes. Sections were subsequently incubated with primary antibodies (polyclonal anti-NOD-2, Cayman Chemicals, USA and
monoclonal CD68, Dako, Germany) at a 1:200 dilution
in 0.75% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. After washing
in PBS, tissue bound antibody was detected using biotinylated goat-anti rabbit IgG antibodies (Vector) followed
by FITC-conjugated avidin, both diluted at 1:100 in PBS
and/or Cy3-conjugated rabbit-anti mouse (Jackson
Immuno, PA, USA) at 1:350 in PBS. Controls were
included using irrelevant primary antibodies as well as
omitting the primary antibodies using only secondary
antibodies and/or FITC-conjugated avidin. Fluorescence
was detected by an Axioimager Apotome-equipped microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with appropriate filter systems
and pictures were captured by a digital camera system
(Axiocam, Zeiss, Germany).
Genotyping
DNA samples from patients and control subjects were
analyzed for the three major functional CARD15 variants
R702W (rs2066844), G908R (rs2066845) and 1007fs
(rs2066847) using TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assays
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA). The callrate of the
genotypes was at least 99% for any of the three assays.
Statistical analysis
All three mutations were assessed for significant deviation
from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in controls and
cases using the software HaploView, version 3.2 [42]. Single marker case-control analyses were performed with χ2
statistics or Fisher's exact test using the statistical genetics
software GENOMIZER [43]. Power calculation was carried out with OpenEpi [44]. To allow for adjustment of
the five known CHD confounding factors (gender, BMI,
blood pressure, diabetes and smoking), logistic regression
analysis was performed within the R statistical environment, version 2.3.1 [45].
