Abstract
Background: Domains are the building blocks of proteins. During evolution, they have been
duplicated, fused and recombined, to produce proteins with novel structures and functions.
Structural and genome-scale studies have shown that pairs or groups of domains observed together
in a protein are almost always found in only one N to C terminal order and are the result of a single
recombination event that has been propagated by duplication of the multi-domain unit.
Previous studies of domain organisation have used graph theory to represent the co-occurrence
of domains within proteins. We build on this approach by adding directionality to the graphs and
connecting nodes based on their relative order in the protein. Most of the time, the linear order
of domains is conserved. However, using the directed graph representation we have identified nonlinear features of domain organization that are over-represented in genomes. Recognising these
patterns and unravelling how they have arisen may allow us to understand the functional
relationships between domains and understand how the protein repertoire has evolved.
Results: We identify groups of domains that are not linearly conserved, but instead have been
shuffled during evolution so that they occur in multiple different orders. We consider 192 genomes
across all three kingdoms of life and use domain and protein annotation to understand their
functional significance.
To identify these features and assess their statistical significance, we represent the linear order of
domains in proteins as a directed graph and apply graph theoretical methods. We describe two
higher-order patterns of domain organisation: clusters and bi-directionally associated domain pairs
and explore their functional importance and phylogenetic conservation.
Conclusion: Taking into account the order of domains, we have derived a novel picture of global
protein organization. We found that all genomes have a higher than expected degree of clustering
and more domain pairs in forward and reverse orientation in different proteins relative to random
graphs with identical degree distributions. While these features were statistically over-represented,
they are still fairly rare. Looking in detail at the proteins involved, we found strong functional
relationships within each cluster. In addition, the domains tended to be involved in protein-protein
interaction and are able to function as independent structural units. A particularly striking example
was the human Jak-STAT signalling pathway which makes use of a set of domains in a range of
orders and orientations to provide nuanced signaling functionality. This illustrated the importance
of functional and structural constraints (or lack thereof) on domain organisation.

Background
One of the driving forces behind protein evolution is the
duplication and shuffling of domains [1-3]. There are
approximately 1500 known domain superfamilies that
have been combined in different ways to form the protein
repertoire (SCOP version 1.65, [4] and corroborated by
[5]). Domains can be thought of as the building blocks of
proteins. During evolution, pairs and groups of domains
have joined to form multi-domain proteins. In many
cases, these groups have then been preserved and duplicated to generate higher-order combinations [6-8]. Unravelling how this duplication and rearrangement has
occurred allows us to understand the functional relationships between domains and determine how proteins have
evolved. Structural and genome-scale studies have shown
that pairs of domains that are adjacent on proteins are
usually the result of a single recombination event which is
preserved and duplicated as a unit. [9] found that N-C terminal order of any particular pair of domains is almost
always preserved across protein space. That is, if the
domain pair A-B is observed, B-A is unlikely to occur. [10]
showed that this extends to triplets of domains and identified two and three domain patterns that are over represented. [11] showed that multi-domain architectures are
almost always the result of a single recombination event
with convergent evolution to generate a particular pattern
of domains being rare. Further, structural analysis of the
geometry of adjacent domains indicated that most
domain pairs we observe next to each other on a protein
have become joined once in evolution [12]. Recent studies have found higher rates of domain architecture reinvention, but the proportion of these cases is still low
[13].
Some domains occur in multiple of different domain
architectures. They are relatively rare, typically involved in
protein-protein interactions [14] and most often located
at the ends of proteins or as single domain proteins [15].
Previous global studies of domain organisation have used
undirected graphs to represent the co-occurrence of
domains within proteins [16-23]. These studies represented proteins as a graph with vertices corresponding to
domains and edges linking domains that are found within
one protein. This model views a protein as a "bag of
domains" because all domains on the protein are linked
irrespective of their order or relative positions. For example, [16] analysed the global properties of the network
showing that the domain graph has small-world and
scale-free topology and [17] used the domain graph representation to compare changes in domains and combinations between genomes. These analyses concentrated on
the global properties of the network and used the "bag of
domains" model which does not account for evolutionary
changes manifested through re-ordering of domains. We

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/39

set out to consider the functional and evolutionary importance of domain order by building a model that accounts
for the relative position of domains on a protein. Given
the importance of domain order as shown by structural
and sequence-based studies (described above), incorporation of information about sequential domain arrangements may lead to novel insights into how proteins are
organised.
We describe a directed domain graph that takes into
account the sequential order of domains. To begin, we
evaluate the global properties of the directed networks
and compare them with random and previously studied
examples. We then assess the domain graphs for individual genomes and phylogenetic groups. Aside from global
properties, our analysis also identified cases of non-linear
domain organisation. For example, domains form clusters
that are highly inter-linked, in particular with links
between pairs of neighbours [see Additional file 1] exemplified by Figure 1. While in general the linear order of
domains is conserved, we identified groups of domains
that have been shuffled during evolution so that they
occur in a range of permutations across different proteins.
This prompts a multitude of questions: why do these
exceptional arrangements exist? is there something special
about the functions or structures of domains that occur
within such clusters? Are the non-linear arrangements
specific to genomes or are they conserved in evolution?
We consider 192 genomes across all three kingdoms of
life and use domain/protein annotation to investigate the
functional significance of these higher-order patterns of
domain organisation. Finally, we assess the phyletic distribution of clusters in order to establish their evolutionary
relationships. structures where domains are defined by to

Results and discussion
0.1 Global features of domain organisation
We consider proteins in terms of their domains based on
the SCOP database [4] superfamily definition of a
domain. Domains were assigned to proteins using the
SUPERFAMILY database (v1.65, [24]) predictions and
include 192 completely sequenced genomes (19 archaea,
129 bacteria and 44 eukaryotes, [see Additional file 2]).
These assignments are used to determine the sequential
order of domains along a protein, termed the protein's
domain architecture. We represented domain architectures as a directed graph with superfamilies as nodes and
directed edges linking adjacent domains from the N- to Cterminus (Figure 1). We chose the SUPERFAMILY database because it represents domains that highly divergent
but evolutionarily related.

This section presents the global properties of the directed
domain graph, establishes its topology and compares it

with the previously studied "bag-of-domains" model
[16,17]. The properties we considered were: mean degree,
degree distribution, mean clustering coefficient, characteristic path length and network density. We explain each
network parameter, describe the values observed for the
directed domain graph in comparison to random expectation and discuss their biological significance.
The degree distribution [see Additional file 1] of the
directed domain graph follows a power-law: a small
number of superfamilies have many neighbours, while
the majority have only one or two. Networks with powerlaw degree distribution are described as having scale-free
topology [25].
In order to assess the significance of the domain graph's
global network properties, we compared the observed values with those expected at random. The randomly
expected values were determined by calculating the network properties for 1000 random graphs. We were specifically interested in the network properties that are
impacted by domain order: the clustering relationships of
domains, the density and connectedness of the network.
In designing our randomisation strategy it was important
to consider both the known properties of the graph and

the parameters of interest. We knew that the domain
graph was scale free. A simple randomisation approach
that preserves only the number of nodes and edges generates a truly random graph, with a degree distribution that
follow a Poisson distribution [25]. By definition, such
random graphs will exhibit significantly different global
properties from their scale-free counterparts, making
comparisons between observed network properties and
these random graphs meaningless.
To overcome this problem, we generated random graphs
with precisely the same degree distribution as the
observed graph [26,27] (explained in Figure 2). This
allowed us to assess the bidirectionality, clustering, density and connectedness of the network. We compared the
clustering and density of nodes in the observed network
to our random model. The mean clustering coefficient
[see Additional file 1] is higher than expected at random
and the characteristic path length [see Additional file 1] is
longer (Table 1). This is consistent with small-world
topology [28] and is also observed for the "bag-ofdomains" model [16,17]. The graph has a lower density
than would be expected at random meaning that a smaller
fraction of possible pairs of nodes are directly/indirectly
connected. This suggests that on a global level, domains
have tended not to recombine with many partners that are

Algorithm for generating random scale-free graphs with a fixed degree distribution
Algorithm for generating random scale-free graphs with a fixed degree distribution. (A) The algorithm takes the
observed domain graph. The example shown here has incoming edges marked in blue and outgoing in yellow. (B) The in and
out-degrees for each node are recorded while the connectivity is discarded. (C) The program randomly selects one node from
each of the in- and out-degree lists. This pair of nodes is connected and removed from their respective lists. Through a series
of iterations, the graph is assembled. If a selected pair of nodes is already present in the partially built graph, they are returned
to the candidate lists and a second pair is randomly chosen. Towards the completion of the graph it is not uncommon for all
possible new pairs to already be in the graph because the domain graph is scale-free with a small number of high-degree nodes.
In this case, an edge is randomly selected from the partially built graph and the the inward links are exchanged. This procedure
generates random graphs with identical degree distribution to the initial graph.
also highly connected. Instead there are clear hubs, nodes
that are highly connected which link to relatively poorly
connected neighbours.
New to our directed model of domain organisation is the
notion of inward and outward edges; as a result, we have
two degree distributions (incoming and outgoing). Both
the in- and out-degree obey a power-law distribution.
Highly connected nodes (i.e. those with more than 50
edges) have in- and out-degrees that are correlated so that
any particular node has approximately equal numbers
(mean 0.52, standard deviation 0.07) of inward and out-

ward links (Figure 3). This shows that domains combine
with partner domains equally on their N and C sides.
Note that the incoming and outgoing links generally
come from or go to different domain superfamilies. There
are only a small number of cases where one pair of
domains has links in both directions, these are discussed
below.

The graph represents 6183 distinct domain architectures (from 262,481 proteins in 192 genomes) including 1224 different domain superfamilies.
The mean values and standard deviations of each property are for 1000 random graphs, each generated to have the same in- and out-degree as the
domain organisation graph (Figure 2). The characteristic paths lengths for directed and undirected graphs are numerically quite similar. However,
these numbers cannot be directly compared because the proportion of nodes that are reachable (and hence included in the path length calculation)
is much higher in the undirected graph (61% for the directed compared to 95% for the undirected).

teins from different genomes in a single graph, the
domains represented may not all interact physically or
during evolution. In order focus on evolutionary and
functional features of domain organisation, we considered the global network parameters for the graphs of
domains from individual genomes and phylogenetic
groups of genomes. We calculated the graph parameters
expected at random separately for each genome or group
through 1000 randomisation of each graph.
Restricting the domain set to single or groups of genomes
does not affect the global graph topology compared to
random; all are scale-free and small-world. However,
there is considerable variation in the network parameters
(see Table 2 [see Additional file 2 for the full list of 192
genomes]). The differences can in part be attributed to the
number of domains and domain architectures within
each genome. In particular, the mean degree correlates
strongly with the number of distinct domain architectures
(Figure 4). The overall node connectivity, quantified
through clustering coefficient and characteristic path
length also correlate with the number of distinct domain
architectures (though more weakly). This suggests that the
level of small-world-ness we observe in different genomes
is largely, but not solely, a function of the number of proteins or domain architectures present. The clustering coefficient and percentage of pairs with a direct path for the

An alternative approach to comparing network parameters across genomes is to consider the extent to which each
individual organism differs from the expected values calculated from randomisation experiments. We assessed the
difference between the observed parameters and the mean
of the randomised trials by calculating their difference in
terms of the number of standard deviations. Figure 5 plots
the number of standard deviations between the observed
and randomly expected values for each genome. The
observed average clustering coefficient (Figure 5A) is consistently more than two standard deviations above the
expected value for all genomes. This indicates that a high
degree of clustering of domains occurs across all genomes.
Three groups of bacteria, Borrelia, Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma, stand out as having a relatively small difference
between the observed and expected clustering coefficient.
This could be related to the fact that these organisms are
all parasites with small genomes.
In contrast, the percentage of connected nodes and average path length are not consistently higher or lower than
expected. The percentage of connected domains for the
majority of genomes is slightly lower (0.5 and 2 standard
deviations) than expected; while around 20 bacterial species have values slightly higher than expected. The average
path lengths present a more complicated picture. For the
all-genome graph, the observed path length is longer than
expected. However, for all the archaea, a large proportion
of eukaryotes and around half of the bacteria, the average
path length is slightly lower than expected. For the most
part the single-genome values fall within two standard
deviations of the mean and may not be significant. This
suggests that average path lengths are no different from
the values expected at random and therefore not influenced or controlled by functional or evolutionary constraints.
Section 1 investigates this variability between genomes
further by looking on a case-by-case basis at the functional
significance of these clusters and their phylogenetic distribution.
0.3 Bi-directional paths
[29] and 9 demonstrated that N-C terminal domain order
is generally conserved across proteins. That is, if domain A
is found N-terminal to domain B, the reverse combination
(BA) tends not to exist. [12] and [30] looked in detail at
the structures of proteins that contradict this rule such that
one protein has domain combination AB while a second
contains BA. They found that in general the relative struc-

Distinct domain architectures compared to genome graph properties. a) Mean Degree b) Mean Clustering Coefficient c) Characeristic Path Length d) Percentage of pairs with paths. Each genome is represented by one point (labelled with its
abbreviation used in the SUPERFAMILY database). Archaea are coloured red, bacteria yellow, eukaryotes blue and groups of

tural orientation of domains A and B was different in the
forward compared to the reverse case and the proteins
have different functions. The clusters above illustrate that
there are cases where pairs of domains are observed in
both orientations; we call these bi-directional paths.
From the genome level domain graphs, we identified all
bi-directional paths (a selection of genomes are listed in

Table 3). We found that while the percentage of adjacent
domain pairs found in both forward and reverse orientations is small (between around 3% and 6%), these values
are significantly higher than expected at random. This
means that bidirectional links are over-represented in
genomes. Note that this does not contradict previous
studies because we are concerned with number of different bidirectionally oriented domain pairs regardless of the

For each genome or phylogenetic group of genomes, we calculated the number of domains, distinct domain architectures, mean degree, mean
clustering coefficient, network density (as a percentage of pairs that are connected) and the characteristic path length (each of these properties is
defined [see Additional file 1]). The number of standard deviations between the randomised and observed graphs is included in parentheses. The
parameters for all 192 genomes considered are provided [see Additional file 2].

prevalence of these pairs within the protein repertoire. In
contrast, [29] counted the number of any given pair of
occurrences within the protein repertoire and observed
that bidirectionally linked domain pairs are rare. The
domain pairs found in both orientations in human are
shown in Table 4). It is interesting to note that they
include signal transduction and protein interaction
domains.
1 Local features of domain organisation
The global analysis described above highlighted features
of domain organisation occurring more often than
expected at random that cannot be explained by a simple
30

linear model of domain combination evolution. First, the
level of clustering within the directed domain graphs is
higher than expected at random. That means that some
groups of domains have recombined in multiple different
ways. Second, some domain pairs are found in two different N-C terminal orders, and this occurs more often than
expected at random. That is, domain A is sometimes followed and other times preceded by B, providing evidence
of functional but not evolutionary links. This section discuss these features locally, using functional annotation to
investigate why they occur and how they are distributed
across phylogenetic groups.

Standard deviations between observed and random for all genomes
Standard deviations between observed and random for all genomes. a) Clustering coefficient b) Path length c) Density. Plots show for each genome (x-axis) the number of standard deviations (based on 1000 randomisations of each graph
while preserving scale free topology) between the observed and expected values (y-axis). For example, a bar that stops at -3
indicates the observed value was three standard deviations below the randomly expected value. Positive values are shown in
blue, negative in green. Genomes have been grouped by kingdom as indicated by the red, yellow and blue regions below the xaxis. The black region marks the graphs that are combinations of genomes in the following order: all genomes, archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes, multicellular eukaryotes and unicellular eukaryotes. The mean degree was excluded from this analysis because
it was intentionally fixed for the randomisation experiments.

The number of pairs of nodes with bi-directional paths connecting
them. Within the set, some are the result of a single domain
architecture with domains arranged ABA while others occur in
multiple proteins with one domain architecture AB and another BA.
The percentage of adjacent domain pairs with bidirectional links is
given followed by the number of standard deviations between the
randomised and observed domain graphs. We see a significant
difference in all cases (p < 0.001).

1.1 Function of domain clusters
One of the most pronounced features of the domain
graph is the higher than expected mean clustering coefficient. For the complete domain graph, the mean clustering coefficient is 22.5 standard deviations above that of
the random graphs. In comparison, the characteristic path
length and network density are only +2 and -5 standard
deviations from the random mean. A high mean clustering coefficient indicates that the domain graph includes
groups of nodes whose neighbours are interlinked. In the
context of domain organisation, this means that there are
groups of promiscuous domains that occur in multiple
different combinations.

To investigate the functional and evolutionary features of
these clusters, we extracted groups of domains with interlinking neighbours from genome level domain organisation graphs for 192 completely sequenced genomes. This
gave us a list of proteins present in each cluster. In order
to identify functional relationships, we used the KEGG
pathway database [31] and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation. This allowed us to extract clusters of domains with

every node represented in a particular functional category.
We focused on GO molecular function and biological
process categories with between 5 and 500 member proteins (in order to exclude both overly specific and very
large, non-specific functional groups). We found that for
every cluster, all nodes belong to at least one common GO
category; significantly more than expected by chance (p <
0.001 [see Additional file 3]). Statistical significance was
assessed by comparing the proportion of randomly
selected groups of domains that belong to a common
functional class with the observed proportion. Random
groups were sampled from the entire domain graph and
chosen to be the same size as each observed cluster; randomisation was carried out 1,000 times per cluster.
For example, considering the clusters shown in Figure 6,
we find 19 different GO categories that are common
within one or more clusters. These include: cell-cell signaling, identical protein binding, induction of apoptosis
and receptor binding. (A complete list is provided [see
Additional file 3].)
The Jak-STAT signalling pathway (from the KEGG database, [31]) includes domains that form a cluster. Figure 7
shows the pathway with each protein represented by its
domain architecture (derived from the SUPERFAMILY
database, [24]). A small number of domains including:
SH2, SH3, PH-like and PK-like, recur in multiple combinations. Signal transduction is known to involve highly
modular proteins; made up of a relatively small number
of components that have mixed-and-matched to generate
all necessary functions [32]. By re-using domains in different contexts, a relatively small domain repertoire can produce a range of wirings within the cell.
The clusters we describe are an extreme form of re-use,
because not only have individual domains recombined
with multiple partners, but their partners have recombined with each-other. Aside from signal-transduction

Eukaryotic signal transduction: The Jak-STAT signalling pathway

The labelled domains found in the Homo sapiens graph cluster (Figure 1) include SH2 (blue), PK-like (red), PH (pink), SH3 (green), RasGEF (turquoise), ARM (magenta). The arrows illustrate the

domains, the two central human clusters (shown in figure
7) also include protein-interaction domains; for example,
the Ankyrin repeat domain. These clusters are examples
where the proteins involved make use of the protein interaction domains in different combinations and with other
partners to diversify or specialise their functions.
This suggests that functional and structural constraints (or
lack there-of) can lead to exceptional arrangements of
domains. For instance, multi-domain structures that are
essentially beads-on-a-string with no fixed interface
between domains are more likely to be functional in multiple orientations than their tightly (structurally) interlinked counterparts. Many of the domains we observe
within our clusters can function independently of their
neighbours.
1.2 Phyletic patterns of human domain clusters
The clusters that we observed in Homo sapiens are almost
exclusively eukaryote-specific (shown in Figure 6) and for
the most part the domains that occur within the clusters
are themselves found only in eukaryotes. Even for the
domains that are found in bacteria, the particular combinations we observe in clusters are peculiar to eukaryotes.

The great majority of human clusters are also found in
Chimpanzee and almost all of these are present in mouse
and rat. Looking at more distantly related Chordate
genomes the conservation declines rapidly with only the
central cluster common to chicken and many links missing in Xenopus tropicalis, Fugu rubripes, Danio rerio and
Ciona intestinalis. If we look to even more distantly related
species, for example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, none of the
clusters are conserved.

Conclusion
The arrangement of domains within proteins has been
studied previously using a graph representation where
nodes are domains and edges join domains observed
within a single protein. A shortcoming of this representation is that it does not take into account the N to C terminal arrangement of domains on the protein. We have
developed a directed graph model of domain organisation that considers order and relative N to C terminal
position. By investigating the global properties of the network, we have shown that domain clustering occurs significantly more often than expected at random.
Considering each genome in isolation we found that the
high degree of clustering observed for the multi-genome
dataset also holds for each genome individually. However, the characteristic path length and percentage of connected nodes are not very different from the randomly
expected values. These findings suggest that the domain
organisation of individual genomes varies but all show a
higher than expected degree of clustering.
Focusing in detail on domain clusters, we identified functional constraints that make this arrangement highly preferable to the organism. Clusters in human are almost
exclusively eukaryote-specific and have roles in signal
transduction and protein-protein interaction.
Finally, we observe pairs of domains found in forward
and reverse orientation in different proteins more often
that would be expected at random. While previous work
has shown that this phenomenon is rare in terms of the
number of occurrences in proteins, we see the opposite
trend for the existence of such domain pairs. The function

Global properties of the genome domain architecture network. For
each genome or phylogenetic group of genomes, we calculated the number
of domains, distinct domain architectures, mean degree, mean clustering
coefficient, network density (as a percentage of pairs that are connected)
and the characteristic path length (each of these properties is defined [see
Additional file 1]). The mean values and standard deviations of each
property shown in parentheses are for 1000 random graphs, generated to
have the same in- and out-degree as the domain organisation graph for
each group of genomes (the algorithm for generating these graphs is
described in Additional File 1).

Function of domain clusters. The functional relationships between
domains in each cluster were assessed using GO annotation. We found
that all clusters with a clustering coefficient greater than zero had at least
one GO category in common. Permutation analysis, taking into account
the size of each GO category, indicated that this is statistically significant
(p < 0.001). This table lists, for each cluster with a clustering coefficient
greater than 0 (identified by the central node), the common GO category
to which they belong and the number of nodes that are included in the
cluster.
