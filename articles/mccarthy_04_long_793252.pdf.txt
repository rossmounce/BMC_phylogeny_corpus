Abstract

Conclusions: All families of mouse LTR retrotransposons are members of the gypsy-like
superfamily of retroviral-like elements. Several different families of unrelated non-autonomous
elements were identified, suggesting that the evolution of non-autonomy may be a common event.
High sequence similarity between several LTR retrotransposons identified in this study and those
found in distantly related species suggests that horizontal transfer has been a significant factor in
the evolution of mouse LTR retrotransposons.

Retrotransposons are particularly abundant in plants, where
they are often a principal component of nuclear DNA. In corn,
50-80%, and in wheat fully 90%, of the genome is made up of
retrotransposons [1,2]. This percentage is generally lower in
animals than in plants but it can still be significant. For example, about 8% of the human genome is now known to be composed of LTR retrotransposons [3]. In the mouse genome this
figure has been estimated at 10% [4].
This article presents the results of a recent survey (December
2002) of the GenBank mouse (M. musculus) database

information

Retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that make up
a large fraction of most eukaryotic genomes. All retrotransposons are distinguished by a life cycle involving an RNA
intermediate. The RNA genome of a retroelement is copied
into a double-stranded DNA molecule by reverse transcriptase, which is subsequently integrated into the host's
genome. Retrotransposons fall into two main categories:
those with long terminal repeats (LTRs), such as retroviruses
and LTR retrotransposons, and those that lack such repeats,
for example, long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs).

Background

refereed research

Results: Using a new data-mining program, LTR_STRUC, in conjunction with conventional
techniques, we have mined the GenBank mouse (Mus musculus) database and the more complete
Ensembl mouse dataset for LTR retrotransposons. We report here that the M. musculus genome
contains at least 21 separate families of LTR retrotransposons; 13 of these families are described
here for the first time.

deposited research

Background: Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons make up a large fraction of the typical
mammalian genome. They comprise about 8% of the human genome and approximately 10% of the
mouse genome. On account of their abundance, LTR retrotransposons are believed to hold major
significance for genome structure and function. Recent advances in genome sequencing of a variety
of model organisms has provided an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate better the diversity of
LTR retrotransposons resident in eukaryotic genomes.

(GBMD) and the 2.9 Gbp Ensembl [5] mouse dataset (EMD)
for the presence of LTR retrotransposons. We have employed
a new search program, LTR_STRUC (LTR retrotransposon
structure program), as the initial data-mining tool in our survey [6]. Identified elements were subjected to sequence analyses to identify open reading frames (ORFs) encoding reverse
transcriptase (RT) and other retroviral proteins.
LTR_STRUC finds only full-length elements, that is, ones
having two LTRs and a pair of target site duplications (TSDs).
We therefore augmented our search approach by conducting
BLAST searches using reverse transcriptase queries. These
queries are of two types: previously known RTs in the public
database from mouse and other mammals, and RTs obtained
from our initial scan of the EMD with LTR_STRUC. Subsequent RT sequence alignments were carried out, followed by
construction of phylogenetic trees.
An LTR retrotransposon 'family' is defined as a group of elements with RTs at least 90% similar at the amino acid level
[7]. Experience has shown that when two elements have RTs
that are 90% similar, their LTRs are typically about 60% similar. Thus, non-autonomous elements, lacking an RT ORF,
are assigned to the same family if their LTRs are at least 60%
similar. Many LTR retrotransposons replicate non-autonomously. Four different families of murine LTR
retrotransposons have non-autonomous members. (MalR
elements, ETn elements, VL30 elements and a new type identified in this study, related to IAP elements). These nonautonomous elements are discussed below. Non-autonomous
elements can reach a high copy number even though they lack
an RT ORF [4,8-11].
Currently there is no standard mouse retrotransposon
nomenclature. In our system of classification for mouse, LTR
retrotransposons are specified by the acronym Mmr (M. musculus retrotransposon). Distinct families are indicated by
number (for example, Mmr1, Mmr2, Mmr3). We have chosen
to adopt the Mmr nomenclature in this study because it is
consistent with the systematic logic ('Mm' indicative of the
genus and species of the host organism; 'r' indicates retrotransposon) used in previous articles [8,12]. In each case
where we use the Mmr acronym in this article to refer to a
previously named family, we also include any pre-existing
name for the family.

Results and discussion

RTs from elements identified in our survey fall into numerous
distinct families. All autonomous LTR retrotransposons identified were of the gypsy-like elements (Classes I, II, and III).
Autonomous retroviral-like elements in the mouse genome
usually have an overall length of between 6,000 and 9,000
bp. Results of our study indicate that the TSDs of mouse LTR
retrotransposons are four to six base pairs long and that
within each of the three major classes of these elements a single TSD length is characteristic (see below). With the

http://genomebiology.com/2004/5/3/R14

exception of a few mutated copies, mouse LTR retrotransposons seem to have the same canonical dinucleotides terminating the LTRs as are typically found in other species (TG/
CA). The LTRs of murine retroviral-like elements are generally 300-600 bp long, with the exception of mouse mammary
tumor virus (MMTV) where the LTRs are some 1,300 bp in
length. Our survey shows that at least 21 distinct LTR retrotransposon families exist in the mouse genome, 13 of which
have not been described previously.

LTR retrotransposon families of the murine genome
Overview
To date, LTR retrotransposon diversity has been rigorously
classified into families for only a few organisms (for example,
Oryza sativa [8], Drosophila melanogaster [7] and
Caenorhaditis elegans [12]). This article represents a first
attempt to establish a similar uniform classification and
nomenclature for the domestic mouse. Previous studies have
classified murine retrotransposons into broad categories
only, which ignore the standard definition of 'family' (see
above). For example, the term 'intracisternal type A particle'
(IAP) has been used to refer to elements that belong to several
distinct LTR-retrotransposon phylogenetic groups. The
autonomous elements identified in our survey of the GBMD
and EMD fall into 20 families on the basis of degree of RT
divergence (greater than 10% denotes family). In addition, we
have classified MalR elements, which are non-autonomous,
into a twenty-first family that is closely related to MuERV-L
elements, because these two types of transposons have similar LTRs. MusD and ETn elements form a second pair of
related autonomous and non-autonomous elements;
MmERV and VL30 elements constitute a third. These three
paired families are discussed in more detail below.
Our analysis supports previous categorization [4] of mouse
LTR retrotransposons into three distinct classes (Figure 1):
Class I, containing elements related to retroviral leukemia
viruses in mouse (MuLV) and other species (for example, gibbon: GALV and cat: FeLV); Class II which contains the IAP
elements, mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) and the
MusD2/ETn family; and Class III which comprises the MalR
and MuERV-L elements. In using these names for the three
main categories of murine LTR retrotransposons we follow
the usage of the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium [4],
but the reader is cautioned that the same terminology has
been used to designate RNA-based transposons (Class I) and
DNA-based transposons (Class II). Here, however, all three
classes are RNA-based LTR retrotransposons.

Class I (families 1-4)
Members of this class make up 0.68% of the mouse genome
(copy number about 34,000) [4]. They have 4-bp TSDs and
are related to murine leukemia virus (MuLV; AF033811), a Ctype retrovirus that occurs only in mice and is a major cause
of cancer in that genus. Class I, to which MuLV belongs, contains at least three other families: Mmr1_MmERV,

sequence (AAA73090) is approximately 56% similar at the
amino acid level to members of Class I. BLAST searches with
RT queries from Class I indicate that at least some elements
in the human genome are even more similar (>65%) to Class
I elements in mouse (for example, HSAP-2; Figure 2 and
Table 1).

Mmr3_MuRRS, and Mmr4. In this article, MuLV is referred
to as family Mmr2_MuLV. Class I endogenous retroviruses
are more closely related to elements in other species than to
mouse retroelements belonging to Classes II or III. RTs from
endogenous retrovirus in pig (PK15; AF038601) and koala
(KoRV; AAF15098), as well as from leukemia viruses in gibbon (GALV; AAA466810) and cat (FeLV; L06140), group
with this class; their RTs are all about 80% similar at the
amino acid level to those of murine Class I elements. One
member of Class I is found in two different mouse species, M.
musculus and M. dunni, and has previously been referred to
as either MmERV (in M. musculus) or MDEV (in M. dunni)
[13]; here it is referred to as Mmr1_MmERV. The identity of
this family in these two species is demonstrated by the presence of an element (AAC31805) in the M. dunni (Indian
pigmy mouse) genome, which is 96% similar (at the amino
acid level) to members of Mmr1_MmERV resident in M.
musculus (Figure 2). This finding is consistent either with a
recent common origin of these two mouse species or with a
horizontal transfer of this retrovirus. This virus may be infectious since an envelope protein sequence is present in the
GenBank database (AAC31806) for the M. dunni retrovirus
and has also been detected in copies of this family during our
own survey of M. musculus. Mmr4 is a previously unrecognized Class I family, with members about 80% similar to
those of Mmr2_MuLV. Family Mmr3_MuRRS includes the
so-called murine retroviral related sequences (MuRRS). A
known human endogenous retrovirus type C oncoviral

Another family in Class II, Mmr19_MusD, has been previously described under the name MusD. Mager and Freeman
[9] who discovered this family, showed that the non-autonomous mouse ETn retroelements (early transposons) are deletion derivatives of Mmr19_MusD. They are so closely related
to MusD elements that we have assigned them to the same
family. Most copies of the former are around 5,500 bp long,
while those of the latter are usually around 7,400 bp in length.
ETn elements (Y17107; AB033509), first reported by Brulet et
al. [14], are a moderately repetitive family of murine retrotransposons that lack most of the usual retroviral ORFs. Our
survey with LTR_STRUC suggests that full-length copies of
ETn elements are about half as common again as full-length
MusD elements. Family Mmr12 is about 80% similar to
Mmr19_MusD. Both of these families are 70% similar to
Mason-Pfizer Monkey Virus (MPMV; NC_001550). The RTs
of MusD elements have an unusual active site sequence: FTDDVLM ('T' is not canonical for an active site) [14]. Class II
contains an additional clade (See Figure 3), comprising at
least eight additional families (Mmr6, Mmr7, Mmr9,
Mmr10_IAP, Mmr14, Mmr15, Mmr17, and Mmr18) with no
two families differing from any other by more than 70%. The
major constituents of this clade are the IAP retrotransposons,
the second most abundant family in the mouse genome, here
referred to as family Mmr10_IAP. They lack complete env
genes [15] and thus are considered non-infective. Murine elements identified in GenBank as IAP (for example, GNPSIP
and GNMSIA) are restricted to family Mmr10_IAP. Nevertheless, members of any of the eight families listed above have
been described as IAP by various authors. In addition, a family of retroelements in golden hamster (GH-G18 }; Figure 3)
have been described as 'IAP' but do not actually belong to the
Mmr10_IAP family (their RT ORFs differ from those of

Class II retroviral-like elements make up 3.14% of the mouse
genome (copy number approximately 127,000) [4]. This class
contains 15 of the 21 murine LTR families. Its members have
6 bp TSDs and are related to MMTV (NC_001503), an oncogenic B-type retrovirus that causes breast cancer in mice. Our
survey has revealed only three full-length copies of a member
of this family (Mmr11_MMTV) in the mouse genome. MMTV
contains an ORF coding for envelope protein (BAA03768).
Mmr11_MMTV RTs are also 75% similar to those of a separate endogenous mouse family, Mmr16. For the most part,
Mmr16 seems to be represented in the mouse genome by
fragmentary elements, but the full-length element Mmr16-1
described in Table 2 has a full complement of retroviral genes,
including an envelope ORF, as is the case with MMTV.

Mmr10_IAP by about 18% at the amino acid level). Thus, in
mice, the term IAP might best be restricted to Mmr10_IAP.
Numerous IAP elements share a common, 1,800-bp deletion
that includes the upstream end of the RT. Yet these elements
were, and perhaps still are, capable of transposing as evidenced by the fact that copies with the same deletion were
found on many different chromosomes. Even shorter, internally-deleted elements, with two LTRs and ostensibly capable
of transposition, can be assigned to Mmr10_IAP on the basis
of LTR similarity (down to about 2,700 bp in overall length).

Class III (families 20 and 21)
Members of this class make up 5.40% of the mouse genome
(copy number about 442,500) [4]. They have 5 bp TSDs and
Class III has two constituents: murine ERV-L elements,
which have an estimated copy number of 37,000 [4]; and the
non-autonomous MalRs (mammalian apparent LTR retrotransposons), which are the most common retroviral element
in the mouse genome, making up 4.8% of the mouse genome
[4]. MuERV-L elements are closely related to human endogenous retrovirus L (HERV-L). In BLAST searches we have
identified a human element (HSAP-1; Table 1 and Figure 4)
that is 85% similar at the amino acid level to MuERV-L RTs.
Because alignments show that their LTRs are 51% similar, we
conclude that murine MalRs and MuERV-L elements share a
recent common ancestor. However, as they are not quite suf-

ficiently similar to be members of the same family, we have
assigned these families the names Mmr20_ MuERV-L and
Mmr21_MaLR.
Like MalRs in other species, murine MalRs are all internally
deleted. The internal region contains only non-coding repetitive DNA. Nevertheless they have typical LTRs, primer binding site and polypurine tract. Members of Mmr21_MaLR are
of two types: MT MalRs - the most common type of LTR retrotransposon in the mouse genome (mean length approximately 1,980 bp); and ORR1 MalRs (mean length
approximately 2,460 bp). Our survey suggests that in the
mouse genome, MT MalRs are about ten times as common as
their longer relatives, the ORR1 MalRs. Non-truncated copies
of Mmr20_ MuERV-L elements have an overall length of
about 6,400 bp.

Length variation in murine LTR retrotransposons
Although all copies of family Mmr10_IAP found by
LTR_STRUC have two LTRs and recognizable TSDs (as
required by the search algorithm employed by the program),
the individual members of this abundant family vary widely
in overall length (2,700-7,200 bp) due to the presence of
internal deletions of varying length. On the other hand, the
two abundant types of non-autonomous Class III elements
(MT and ORR1 MalRs) exhibit a markedly different pattern of

a VL30 element (AF486451) with our data revealed a high
degree of LTR-LTR similarity (>90%) to elements in family
Mmr1_MmERV and therefore are members of that family
(VL30s are non-autonomous and cannot be compared with
other elements on the basis of RT similarity).

Certain families of mouse LTR retrotransposons are more
closely related to elements present in other species than to
other classes of mouse elements. For example, murine Class I
elements are more similar to viruses in gibbon, pig, cat, and

ORR1 MalRs peak sharply at 2,300 bp and those of MT
MalRs at 1,980 bp, with very few elements in either case differing from these peak frequencies by more than 100 bp
(<1%). Moreover, most copies of Mmr10_IAP, from the
shortest to the longest, are preponderantly represented by
copies with a high level of LTR-LTR identity (>99%), a finding consistent with recent transposition. The ability of
internally truncated Mmr10_IAPs to complete their replication cycle is consistent with the fact that a number of
Mmr10_IAP copies bearing the same 1,800-bp deletion
(affecting the polyprotein ORF) were found in our survey on
a variety of different mouse chromosomes. A similar

koala, than to murine retrotransposons of Classes II or III
(Figure 2). Among Class II murine endogenous retroviruses
(Figure 3), family Mmr10_IAP is more closely related to the
golden hamster element GH-G18 than it is to any other family
of murine retroviral elements. Similarly, the amino acid
sequences (RT ORFs) of members of Mmr20_MuERV_L
(mouse Class III elements, Figure 4) differ from a human element (for example, HSAP-1, Table 3) by only 15%, but differ
from those of any non-Class III element by more than 60%.
Such findings suggest that horizontal transfer may have been
a source of new mouse LTR retrotransposon families over
evolutionary time.

Conclusions

All autonomous retrotransposons identified in our study were
retroviral-like elements (of Classes I, II, and III). At least 21
distinct families of murine LTR retrotransposons exist. Families Mmr4, Mmr5, Mmr6, Mmr7, Mmr8, Mmr9, Mmr12,
Mmr13, Mmr14, Mmr15, Mmr16, Mmr17, and Mmr18 have
not been previously recognized, 13 families in all. These new
families are all Class II elements (with the exception of
Mmr4, which belongs to Class I) and are thus akin to immune
deficiency viruses such as simian retrovirus SRV-1, to mouse
mammary tumor virus (MMTV), and to IAP elements.

the search, the chances of overlooking low-copy families has
been reduced. The thoroughness of our BLAST search can
only have been augmented by using LTR_STRUC because, in
the BLAST phase of our survey, the queries used were a combination of those element types already recognized, prior to
our investigation, with those found by LTR_STRUC. We
believe this approach is the reason we were able to identify
the 13 previously unreported families listed above.

Table 3 and Figure 3).

Our purpose in using LTR_STRUC to begin our survey of the
mouse genome was to obtain a broadly representative sample
of murine retrotransposons. Since the algorithm it employs is
not dependent upon sequence homology, as in standard
search methods such as BLAST, the initial results of our survey presumably were not biased toward a particular set of
queries. Also, since the current version of LTR_STRUC now
categorizes the elements it locates and assigns a new name to
any element that differs sufficiently from any found earlier in

Materials and methods

Using a new data-mining program, LTR_STRUC [6], we have
mined the Ensembl mouse (M. musculus) dataset [5] for LTR
retrotransposons. We have used elements found in this initial
search, as well as murine LTR retrotransposons identified by
previous workers, to conduct BLAST searches of the GenBank
mouse database.

Automated characterization of LTR retrotransposons

10.

The methods used in our survey of the mouse genome are
essentially the same as those used in our earlier study of the
rice genome and are described elsewhere [8]. Briefly, we
began our survey by using a new computer program,
LTR_STRUC, which identifies new LTR retrotransposons
based on the presence of characteristic retroelement features
[6]. Additional elements were identified by BLAST searches
using the RTs, both of elements located by LTR_STRUC and
of ones previously recognized in earlier studies by previous
researchers.

Datasets scanned
Initial scans with LTR_STRUC were conducted on a dataset
consisting of the 2.9 Gbp of M. musculus sequence data available in the Ensembl database at the time of the initial scan
(December 2002). The dataset (EMD) was obtained from the
Ensembl website [5]. In an effort to identify additional elements not picked up in the initial survey with LTR_STRUC,
we have used representative sequences from each retrotransposon family identified in this study as queries to conduct
BLAST searches against the GenBank mouse database
(GBMD). Thus, the results reported here constitute a
reasonably unbiased survey of LTR-retrotransposon diversity
in mouse. RT sequences were identified according to previously described criteria [16,17].

Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic
analyses
The RT domains of the various Mmr elements were aligned,
as described elsewhere [8], with previously reported RT
sequences (Table 3). In the case of elements lacking an RT
sequence because of fragmentation or internal truncation, the
LTR sequences were used to assign them the proper family.
