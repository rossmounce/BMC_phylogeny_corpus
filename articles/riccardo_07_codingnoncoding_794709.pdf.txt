Abstract
Background: In eukaryotic cells, each molecule of H/ACA small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA)
assembles with four evolutionarily conserved core proteins to compose a specific
ribonucleoprotein particle. One of the four core components has pseudouridine synthase activity
and catalyzes the conversion of a selected uridine to pseudouridine. Members of the pseudouridine
synthase family are highly conserved. In addition to catalyzing pseudouridylation of target RNAs,
they carry out a variety of essential functions related to ribosome biogenesis and, in mammals, to
telomere maintenance. To investigate further the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression
of pseudouridine synthase genes, we analyzed the transcriptional activity of the Drosophila
member of this family in great detail.
Results: The Drosophila gene for pseudouridine synthase, minifly/Nop60b (mfl), encodes two novel
mRNAs ending at a downstream poly(A) site. One species is characterized only by an extended 3'untranslated region (3'UTR), while a minor mRNA encodes a variant protein that represents the
first example of an alternative subform described for any member of the family to date. The rare
spliced variant is detected mainly in females and is predicted to have distinct functional properties.
We also report that a cluster comprising four isoforms of a C/D box snoRNA and two highly
related copies of a small ncRNA gene of unknown function is intron-encoded at the gene-variable
3'UTRs. Because this arrangement, the alternative 3' ends allow mfl not only to produce two
distinct protein subforms, but also to release different ncRNAs. Intriguingly, accumulation of all
these intron-encoded RNAs was found to be sex-biased and quantitatively modulated throughout
development and, within the ovaries, the ncRNAs of unknown function were found not
ubiquitously expressed.
Conclusion: Our results expand the repertoire of coding/non-coding transcripts derived from the
gene encoding Drosophila pseudouridine synthase. This gene exhibits a complex and interlaced
organization, and its genetic information may be expressed as different protein subforms and/or
ncRNAs that may potentially contribute to its biological functions.

Background
H/ACA ribonucleoprotein particles (RNP) in eukaryotes
consist of four highly conserved core proteins and one
molecule of H/ACA small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), and
most of them direct pseudouridylation of target RNAs at
specific sites (reviewed in [1,2]). In this process, one of the
core proteins acts as a pseudouridine synthase, while the
H/ACA snoRNA selects the residues to be isomerized via
specific base-pairing. Proteins catalyzing the conversion
of uridines to pseudouridines belong to a highly conserved family, well-characterized examples of which
include Archaea, yeast and trypanosome Cfb5p [3-5],
Drosophila MFL/NOP60B [6,7], rat NAP57 [8], and
mouse and human dyskerin [9]. In eukaryotes, these proteins accumulate in the nucleolus and participate in various cellular functions including processing and
modification of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and maintenance
of telomere integrity in mammals (reviewed in [10,11]).
Genetic depletion experiments in different organisms
have invariably shown that these proteins are essential for
viability [4,7,12,13], indicating that they have important
biological roles. The finding that human dyskerin is
involved in two congenital diseases further supports this
notion. Mutations in these proteins are responsible for Xlinked dyskeratosis congenita (DC) [9] and for HoyeraalHreidarsson syndrome, now recognized as a severe DC
allelic variant [14]. Functional conservation of pseudouridine synthases is so remarkable that the archaeal aCbf5p
protein has recently been shown to assemble efficiently
with a yeast H/ACA snoRNP core component, Nop10,
and with human telomerase RNA, which has a H/ACA box
motif [15]. The biological role of RNA pseudouridylation
is still debated. It has been suggested that it contributes to
rRNA folding, rRNP assembly and ribosomal subunit
assembly. Subtle enhancing of ribosomal functions such
as codon recognition has also been proposed [16].
Remarkably, recent data indicate that mutations in mammalian dyskerin impair translation from IRES (Internal
Ribosomal Entry Site) elements, thus specifically affecting
cap-independent translation of a subset of mRNAs [17].
However, the role of H/ACA snoRNPs extends beyond
ribosome biogenesis. In fact, although rRNA is the most
common modification target, spliceosomal snRNAs or
tRNAs can also be modified [1,2]. Furthermore, "orphan"
snoRNAs that lack complementarity with rRNA or
snRNAs have also been described, and it is plausible that
they target cellular RNAs that remain unidentified. Since
proteins of the Cbf5p family are essential for biogenesis
and accumulation of H/ACA snoRNAs, mutations in them
might trigger diverse effects. For example, different mutations of human dyskerin have been associated with
reduced levels of distinct subsets of H/ACA snoRNAs [18],
raising the possibility that some pathological aspects of
DC may be related to the particular functions of the specifically-affected forms. Indeed, the repertoire of functions

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/15

attributed to members of the Cbf5 family is wide and continually increasing; these genes may be involved in many
biological processes. In yeast, Cbf5p was first described as
a low-affinity centromeric DNA binding protein [19].
Subsequently, depletion of Cbf5p was shown to cause
nucleolar fragmentation and to disrupt the nucleolar
localisation of tRNA [20]. In mice, DKC1 alleles carrying
hypomorphic mutations led with very high frequency to
tumour development, indicating that the gene acts as a
potent oncosuppressor [21]. A novel role in snoRNA
metabolism has recently been reported for the yeast and
mammalian proteins: they are directly involved in the
early steps of H/ACA snoRNP assembly, since they are
cotranscriptionally recruited at the 3' end of the nascent
H/ACA snoRNAs [22-24]. In trypanosomes, RNAiinduced silencing of Cbf5 has been shown not only to
eliminate pseudouridylation on the spliced leader RNA
(SL RNA), but also to abolish its modification at the
fourth cap-4 nucleotide [5]. As a result of defects in the SL
RNA and decreased modification of the U small nuclear
RNAs, trans-splicing was inhibited at the first step of the
reaction.
Considering the wide range of biological effects directed
by members of the Cbf5 gene family, it is plausible that
this functional complexity might rely, at least in part, on
the production of multiple transcripts with different properties. Since a complex expression pattern is often
observed for multifunctional genes in higher eukaryotes,
we planned to analyse the molecular organization and
transcriptional activity of the Drosophila orthologue in
greater detail, with the aim of better defining its coding
properties and shedding new light on its complex functions. In previous studies, we isolated the gene encoding
Drosophila pseoudouridine synthase, called minifly (mfl;
also called Nop60b) [6,7], and showed that the use of
alternative 3' UTRs resulted in two main mRNAs, 1.8 and
2.0 kb in length. These two species had different expression profiles, with the 1.8 kb mRNA constitutively
expressed in both sexes throughout the life cycle, and the
2.0 kb species mainly expressed in females and maternally
transmitted to the developing embryos [7]. However, the
two transcripts had identical protein coding potentials
and differed only in their 3' untranslated regions
(3'UTRs). As with genes encoding proteins involved in the
synthesis, structure or function of the translational apparatus, mfl was shown to belong to the 5' TOP family (Tract
Of Polypyrimidines) [7,25]. Members of this family share
a C residue at the +1 position followed by a 5–15 nt
polypyrimidine tract in a short 5' non-translated region;
their mRNAs typically show growth-dependent translational regulation [26]. We also showed that mfl hosts a
snoRNA gene of the H/ACA class within one of its introns.
This gene, named snoH1, directs pseudouridylation of

BMC Molecular Biology 2007, 8:15

Drosophila 18S rRNA at position U1820 [7], modification of which residue is conserved from yeast to man.
In this paper we report that snoH1 is just one member of
a variegated cluster of small ncRNA genes hosted within
mfl introns, revealing that this gene exhibits a much more
complex overlapping coding/noncoding architecture than
previously suspected. In addition, we show that mfl produces two novel coding transcripts. While one of these
mRNAs is characterized only by an extended 3'UTR, the
second is alternatively spliced, accumulates mainly in
females, and encodes a rare variant protein that is predicted to have distinct functional properties. So far, mfl is
the only eukaryotic pseudouridine synthase gene for
which multiple mRNAs have been reported, and the
description of the variant protein and the various ncRNAs
it can encode may provide useful insights into the various
functions of other members of this conserved family.

or translation within these overlapping 3'UTR sequences.
However, no functional motif currently annotated in the
UTResource database [27] was identified in any of these
regions. Further experiments will therefore be required to
establish whether these sequences include still-unidentified regulatory motifs. Strikingly, Northern analyses of
poly(A)+ RNA revealed that a large polyadenylated transcript of about 4.4 kb also derives from this downstream
region (Fig. 1C). This species had already been detected in
adult female or embryonic RNA preparations by more
upstream mfl genomic probes [7], but previous attempts
to isolate cDNA clones representing this form proved
unsuccessful even after extensive screening of various
cDNA libraries. Since in the present set of experiments we
again failed to identify any product representing this RNA,
its structure remains elusive, so we cannot exclude the
possibility that this species represents a variant transcript
extending much further, or an unprocessed RNA precursor.

Results
Identification of two novel mfl coding transcripts
In previous primer-extension experiments we detected
and mapped a single mfl transcription start site [7] (see
Fig.1A). We also noticed that a very short upstream region
of about 300 bp separates mfl from the close, divergentlytranscribed gene mrp17. On the basis of these observations, we considered that further transcript heterogeneity
is more likely to derive from the alternative 3' ends. Therefore, the transcriptional activity of the gene was first reexamined by 3'-RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA
Ends). Based on the structures of the previously-described
1.8 and 2.0 kb mRNAs (depicted in Fig. 1A) [Gen Bank:
AF017230, AF089837], internal primers were derived
from the sequence of exons 5, 6, 8 and 9 (see Methods for
sequences) and used to search for additional poly(A) sites,
using poly(A)+ RNA extracted from male and female adult
flies as template. In addition to the two expected bands, a
longer product was obtained in each 3'-RACE reaction,
revealing the presence of a poly(A) site further downstream (Fig. 1B). These additional products were markedly more abundant in the female RNA preparation,
implying a sex-bias in the use of this novel 3' site. Subsequent nucleotide analyses of these amplification products
confirmed that mfl encodes a third mRNA that differs
from the 1.8 and 2.0 kb species only in the presence of
three additional exons in a longer 3'UTR (Fig. 1A) [Gen
Bank: DQ857345]. Northern analysis of the poly(A)+
RNA preparations probed with the novel downstream
exons revealed a transcript of about 2.2 kb, expressed
mainly in females (Fig. 1C). This is the expected length for
an mRNA species starting at the previously-mapped 5' site
and terminating at the novel 3' end, further confirming
that the 1.8, 2.0 and 2.2 kb mRNAs are distinguished
solely by 3'-end heterogeneity. We then searched for cisacting control elements affecting mRNA stability, location

We next tried to connect the novel 3' exon cluster with
more upstream exons by RT-PCR, with the aim of detecting alternative splicing events within the coding sequence
of the gene. For this purpose, we used poly(A)+ RNA from
male and female adult flies as template, and various combinations of forward primers positioned inside the coding
region (over exons 2, 5 and 6) with reverse primers positioned along the 2.2 kb-specific 3'UTR exons (exons 10,
11 and 12; see Methods). In each combination, primers
derived from exons 5 or 6 always yielded a single amplification product, markedly more abundant in females;
sequence analysis invariantly confirmed the structure of
the 2.2 kb mRNA previously obtained by 3'-RACE. In contrast, two types of products were always obtained when a
forward primer from exon 2, in each combination of
reverse primers, was used to reverse-amplify female RNA.
In addition to the expected band, a minor product of
smaller size was noticed in each reaction. As an example,
the result of an exon 2–12 RT-PCR amplification from
female RNA is reported in Fig. 2A. In this case, in addition
to the 2 kb product expected from the 2.2 kb mRNA, an
additional product of 740 bp was observed.
Sequence analysis of the additional shorter products
obtained in this set of experiments revealed an alternative
splicing event that joins the 5' splice donor of exon 3 to
the 3' splice acceptor of exon 9. To confirm the presence
of this spliced mRNA, the same 5' primer was used in
combination with either a 3' primer spanning the 3–9
exon junction, able to detect only the alternatively spliced
RNA subform, or one spanning the 5–6 exon junction,
able to detect the whole set of transcripts generated by the
canonical splicing pattern comprising the 1.8 kb constitutive mRNA and the 2.0 and 2.2 kb maternal species. Both
primer pairs yielded positive amplification of a fragment

structure remains to be defined. The amount of RNA loaded on each lane was checked by hybridization with a probe derived
from αTub84B. The RNA marker I (Roche) was utilised (on the right).

with a reverse primer spanning the alternative 3–9 exon junction (P3; lanes 1–2) or the canonical 5–6 exon junction (P4; lanes
3–4); in lanes 5–6, the three primers were added to the same reaction. The 1200 bp fragment represents all three transcripts
generated by the canonical splicing pattern, while the 540 bp fragment derives specifically from the 1.0 kb mRNA. In lanes 7–8,
a 90 bp fragment representating the αTub84B transcript was amplified as internal control of the quantity of RNA.

with the expected size; moreover, both products were
obtained at a significantly higher level in females, indicating that, as previously described for the 2.0 kb [7] and also
for the 2.2 kb species described above, the variant mRNA
exhibits a sex-preferential expression profile (Fig. 2B).
A full-length cDNA clone representing this novel mRNA
was obtained by combining 5' and 3' RACE experiments.
Gene-specific primers were designed to amplify the 5' end
of the transcript and to give fragments partially overlapping with the 3'-RACE products (see Methods). A short
overlapping sequence in the 5' and 3' products allowed us
to construct a virtually full length cDNA by restriction
digestion at the common BamH1site. The fragment
obtained was about 1 kb and its nucleotide sequence
[GenBank: DQ857346] indicated that the novel mRNA

starts at the unique, previously-mapped transcription start
site [7]. Intriguingly, this transcript is characterized by the
skipping of five internal exons and the absence of any
internal stop codon, indicating that it may encode a novel
protein subform (Fig. 1A). Given that the 1.0 kb mRNA
species was barely detected in the Northern analyses of
poly(A)+ RNA preparations, we used quantitative realtime PCR to check its relative abundance in the poly(A)+
RNA preparations obtained from various sources: adult
females, manually dissected adult ovaries and cultured
Schneider 2 (S2) Drosophila cells. The relative abundances of the variant and canonically-spliced mRNAs (the
1.8, 2.0 and 2.2 kb subforms) were compared among the
three samples after normalization against αTub84B
expression. The 1.0 kb mRNA was significantly more
abundant in ovaries than in whole adult females and its

accumulation was at least nine-fold greater; the canonically-spliced mRNA was also slightly enriched in this
organ. In proliferating S2 cells, the alternatively-spliced
species was markedly more abundant, whereas the level of
the canonically-spliced mRNAs was slightly reduced (Fig.
3).
Structural properties and expression of the MFLα novel
protein subform
The rare alternatively-spliced mfl mRNA is predicted to
encode a variant protein of 254 amino acids, with a
molecular mass of 28.9 kDa, which we named MFLα. The
amino acid sequence of this variant protein is shown in
Fig. 4A, aligned below that of MFL, identically encoded by
the 1.8, 2.0 and 2.2 mRNAs, and that of human dyskerin.
MFLα fully overlaps the MFL sequence at its amino-terminal region, where both proteins exhibit an identical tract
of 211 aa that includes the N-terminal nuclear location
signal (NLS), and the two highly-conserved TruBI and
TruBII motifs that share homology with bacterial and
yeast tRNA pseudouridine synthases and are directly
involved in the pseudouridylation process. However,
MFLα exhibits a unique C-terminal tract of 43 residues
that shows no significant homology with any known
functional motif. Instead, this region replaces a large carboxy-terminal portion of the MFL protein that includes at
least three domains for which a functional role has been
proposed. The first missing motif corresponds to the PUA

and cultured S2 cells. Three different RNA extractions were
examined for each sample, and each reaction was performed
in triplicate. Data were normalized to αTub84B expression
and are presented relative to the female sample; they represent three independent experiments.

domain, an RNA binding motif observed in several families of archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic RNA-modifying
proteins including pseudouridine synthases and rRNA
methylases. This domain has also been found in bacterial
and yeast glutamate kinases, as well as in families of
eukaryotic proteins that are thought to act as translation
factors [28]. Intriguingly, it has recently been shown to
play a crucial role in archaeal snoRNP assembly, and to be
necessary for aCbf5p binding to guide RNAs [29]. The second missing domain is represented by a block of more
than twenty residues with a central tyrosine (tyr) that is
identical in MFL and human dyskerin and is highly related
to the uracil-binding pocket in uracil-DNA glycosylases
[7]. Finally, MFLα also lacks a highly-charged lysine-rich
carboxy-terminal region that contains an overlapping
bipartite NLS, raising the possibility that this variant protein may have a different subcellular distribution, or that
it is less tightly retained in the nuclei.
Collectively, these distinctive features suggest that MFLα
may have a distinct role in at least some of the essential
cellular activities of mfl. As a preliminary step to investigating this possibility, we attempted to assess the effective
in vivo accumulation of this rare subform. On the basis of
the observations indicating a higher abundance of the 1.0
kb mRNA in S2 cells, we selected this source for checking
the presence of MFLα protein by Western blotting. Rabbit
polyclonal antibodies were raised against two peptides,
both included in the common N-terminal region of MFL/
MFLα (see Methods), and protein extracts from S2 cells
were subjected to Western analysis with these antibodies.
In addition to the canonical MFL protein, a less abundant
band of the molecular weight expected for MFLα was
detected (Fig. 4B), indicating that the alternatively-spliced
mRNA may encode a variant protein.
A cluster of small ncRNA genes is intron-encoded at the
mfl variable 3' UTRs
To check mfl transcription further, we performed Northern blotting of total RNA preparations using genomic
probes spanning the variable mfl 3' ends. The results
showed that a set of small RNA molecules, about 100 nt
long and highly abundant in females, also derive from
this region. To map these molecules in greater detail,
shorter probes having either exonic or intronic localisation were used to analyse RNA preparations from adult
flies of both sexes (Fig. 5A). Probes derived from introns
6, 7, 8 and 9 all detected the 4.4 kb species (marked by a
triangle). They also detected a radioactive signal of about
85 nt, as estimated by carefully assessing the RNA length
on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and by mapping
the 5' end by primer extension analysis (data not shown;
see Methods). Inspection of the mfl 3' genomic sequence
[GenBank: AF097634] indicated that introns 6, 7, 8 and 9
each host a copy of DmSnR60 (Fig. 5B–C), a snoRNA gene

of the C/D family previously identified in the course of a
genome-wide computational search [30]. The strong
cross-hybridization with rRNA shown by these intronic
probes (Fig. 5A, asterisk on the left) is essentially
explained by their perfect complementarity to the 28S
rRNA molecule, which is recognized by long D and D'
antisense elements (see below). As shown in the figure,
probes spanning introns 10 and 11 detected RNA molecules estimated at 100 nt, again on the basis of 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and primer
extension analysis of the 5' end, in addition to the 4.4 and
2.2 kb mRNAs. Nucleotide analysis of introns 10 and 11
revealed that each hosts a copy of a small ncRNA gene, the
sequence of which substantially overlaps that of the
DmOrC/D_9 a-b molecules [GenBank: AY805216] previously described by Huang et al. [31]. These molecules
exhibit canonical D and D' boxes (Fig. 5A–C) but have a
degenerate C motif with a sequence varying between the
two tandemly-repeated isoforms. The biological functions, if any, of these molecules remained to be firmly
established, so they were classified as orphan C/D snoRNAs [31]. Indeed, we noticed that they lack a nucleolar- or
Cajal body- specific location (see below), so in accordance
with widely-accepted nomenclature [32], we refer to them

as small non-messenger RNAs derived from polytene
region 60 (snm60). The two copies of snm60 (a, b) [GenBank: DQ142641 and DQ142642] share 85% overall
sequence conservation and exhibit a 59 bp internal segment of perfect identity (Fig. 5C). As judged by Southern
blotting (data not shown) and a computational search on
the genome sequence, no other snm60 copy is present
elsewhere in Drosophila.
Organization of the ncRNA gene cluster mapped at the mfl
3'-UTRs conformed to the one-gene-per-intron rule
widely observed in animal genomes. Moreover, we
noticed that the tandemly-clustered DmSnR60 genes are
all located about 70 nt upstream the 3' splice site of their
host introns. In vertebrates, a position about 70 nt
upstream the 3' splice site is reportedly optimal for expression of intronic C/D box snoRNAs, since this distance may
furnish optimal synergy with splicing, favouring C/D box
snoRNP assembly [33]. The conserved position of
DmSnR60 isoforms indicates that the rule observed by
Hirose and coworkers [33] may also be operative in invertebrates. DmSnR60 genes, first described by our group
[30], were reported in a subsequent genome-wide analysis
to be generated, along with DmOrC/D_9 a-b molecules,

derived from intron 9, strongly cross-hybridizes with rRNA (asterisk on the left) because of bipartite DmSnR60 complementarity to 28S sequences. Since Drosophila 28S rRNA is processed into two fragments that migrate in a similar manner to the 18S
rRNA (2.0 kb), cross-reaction labels a band with a mobility similar to that of the mfl 2.2 kb mRNA (indicated by the arrow),
which is specifically recognized by probe 3. (B) Genomic organization of the cluster of small ncRNA genes intron-encoded at
the mfl 3'UTRs; the four copies of the DmSnR60 C/D box snoRNA gene (a, b, c, d) and the two copies of the snm60 (a, b)
exhibit a one gene-per intron organization. (C) Nucleotide sequences of DmSnR60 and snm60 isoforms. Within DmSnR60

by introns of a long, polyadenylated non-coding host
transcript named dUhg 6 [31]. However, identification of
the additional mfl poly(A)+ site in the present study provides clear evidence that DmSnR60 and DmOrC/D_9/
snm60 copies are all intron-encoded by this protein-coding gene.
An intriguing functional consequence of the mfl coding/
non-coding arrangement is that pre-mRNAs ending at different alternative poly (A) sites can release distinct sets of

nested ncRNAs. In fact, a pre-mRNA molecule ending at
the first poly(A) site can exclusively produce the H/ACA
snoRNA H1, while one ending at the middle site may also
release three DmSnR60 isoforms (a, b, c). A pre-mRNA terminating at the most downstream site may instead produce three different types of small ncRNAs, including
snoH1 and all the DmSnR60 (a-d) and snm60 (a-b)isoforms. Strikingly, the ability to release snm60 molecules is
restricted to mfl transcripts ending at the last poly (A) site,
so that production of these ncRNAs is predicted to be cou-

pled with that of the 2.2 and 1.0 kb mRNAs. In conclusion, alternative 3'-ends allow mfl to produce not only two
distinct protein subforms, but also different ncRNAs that
may potentially contribute to its biological functions.
Expression and function of mfl intron-encoded ncRNAs
All the DmSnR60 isoforms (named a, b, c, d) possess
canonical C (5'-UGAUGA-3'), D and D' (5'-CUGA-3')
boxes, suggesting that they encode bifunctional snoRNAs
of the C/D family (Fig. 5C). Long tracts of perfect complementarity to Drosophila 28S rRNA were found upstream
of both the D and D' boxes [30,31]. Since C/D snoRNAs
invariably select the nucleotide positioned 5 base pairs
upstream of the D/D' box for methylation [1,2], these
antisense elements were predicted to modify, respectively,
the G1083 and Am1092 residues (see Fig. 6B), two methylation sites conserved between yeast and vertebrates. In
fact, methylation at the G1083-equivalent residue is
known to be guided by yeast snR60 and mammalian U80
snoRNAs, while Am1092 modification is directed by yeast
snR84 and by a still-unidentified mammalian snoRNA
[34]. Methylated residues have not yet been experimentally mapped on Drosophila rRNA, so we attempted to
detect effective modification at the predicted sites by
reverse transcription of the specific rRNA sequence at low
dNTP concentration, as described by Maden [35]. When
this method is used, a specific reverse transcription stop
occurs on (and/or one nucleotide before) a 2'-O-methylated nucleotide at low, but not at elevated, dNTP concentrations. As shown in Fig 6B, this experiment confirmed

the presence of methylated nucleotides at both predicted
positions. Strikingly, one additional 2'-O-methylation
was detected, at position Gm1108 of 28S rRNA (Fig. 6B).
Modification at this site has not yet been described in
other organisms and may be specific to Drosophila rRNA.
Since no other Drosophila snoRNA that may be able to
methylate the G1083 and the Am1092 residues specifically has so far been described, modification of these sites
strongly supports the functional role of the DmSnR60
molecules as rRNA methylation guides. In contrast, the
function of the snm60 molecules is hard to guess, and further experiments are required.
To characterize further the small ncRNAs originating from
the mfl 3' region, a panel of total RNA samples extracted
from various stages of Drosophila development or from
the S2 cell line was subjected to Northern blot analysis
with probes specific for snoH1, DmSnR60 or snm60. These
intron-encoded ncRNA genes were all actively expressed
in S2 cells, and throughout the Drosophila life cycle they
exhibited a very similar expression pattern (Fig. 7). As
shown in Fig. 7, the ncRNAs accumulate constitutively
throughout development, but their expression is quantitatively modulated, reaching the highest levels in young larvae and in adult females. It should be noted that the
marked sex-bias in snoH1 and DmSnR60 expression is
quite unusual for snoRNAs. Considering that these snoRNAs are devoted to modifying, respectively, the 18S and
28S rRNAs, it is plausible that the higher levels in females
may essentially be due to the higher level of protein syn-

thesis in the ovaries, which in adult females may constitute more than half the body weight.
To address the function of DmSnR60 and snm60 further,
we next investigated their intracellular distribution by in
situ hybridization. Given that these RNAs accumulated at
higher levels in larvae and in adult females, we selected
the intestine as a larval organ and the ovary as an adult
organ for these analyses. When specific digoxigeninlabelled antisense probes were used to analyse wholemount intestine preparations, the DmSnR60 molecules
were shown to be expressed in all cells (Fig. 8). Within
ovarioles, these molecules were also expressed ubiquitously, being detected at all stages of oogenesis in both the
nurse and the follicle cells (Fig. 8, top-left panel). Moreover, DmSnR60 molecules accumulate specifically in the
nucleoli, as substantiated by observation of the large
nuclei of the polyploid nurse cells. These cells develop
unusual nucleoli comprising a shell of interconnected
fibres around the nuclear periphery [36]. As is evident
from the figure, the DmSnR60 hybridization signal in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/15

nurse cells is specifically concentrated in these nuclear
peripheral structures, as expected for bona fide snoRNAs
(Fig. 8, top-left panel). In contrast, snm60 expression in
the ovarioles appeared to be restricted to late oogenesis,
starting from stage 7 (Fig. 8, right-top panel); moreover,
these RNAs accumulated specifically in the nurse cells, not
the follicle cells. Within the nurse cells, the snm60 molecules appear to be concentrated in the nucleoplasm but
are not located within the nucleoli. These ncRNAs also
show an intriguing expression pattern in the larval intestine, where in most microscopic fields they are detected
only in subsets of cells that appear to be actively dividing
(Fig. 8, bottom-right panel). Most cells expressing snm60
RNAs are in fact yet-unseparated daughter cells just exiting
from mitosis, or paired cells that plausibly derive from the
same mitotic event, raising the possibility that expression
of these molecules might be regulated during the cell
cycle. An obvious conclusion from these in situ experiments is that spatial and temporal expression of DmSnR60
and smn60 genes are differentially regulated. It is possible
that smn60 molecules may be independently transcribed
from a specific alternative promoter, or that their biogenesis and/or stability may depend on the presence of specific factors. Whatever the case, such fine regulation was
unexpected and makes it unlikely that these small RNAs
merely represent transcriptional noise.
To investigate this aspect further, we checked the phylogenetic conservation of smn60 genes by searching for their
expression in Drosophila-related species such as D.
yakuba, D. virilis and D. ananassae. By Northern blot experiments, we were able to detect these ncRNAs only in the
most closely-related species D. yakuba (data not shown),
which belongs to the melanogaster subgroup. In contrast,
the DmSnR60 molecules were positively detected in all
three species. A comprehensive picture of sequence conservation of the mfl 3' genomic region is presented in Fig.
9, which shows a diagram of multiple genome alignments
obtained by the UCSC Genome Browser [37]. Peaks in the
conservation plot can be observed for each of the 3'UTR
introns, but strong conservation among all the annotated
genomes of the Drosophila species occurs only for
DmSnR60 isoforms. The weaker phylogenetic conservation displayed by snm60 suggests that these genes may
have evolved more recently. However, evolutionary conservation may not be a reliable signature for functional
ncRNAs, since many regulatory ncRNA evolve quickly and
may co-evolve with their functional targets [38].

Discussion
Production of multiple transcripts with different coding/
non-coding properties is known to contribute largely to
the complexity of eukaryotic transcriptomes, and analysis
of the full range of different transcripts that a gene can
encode may provide important insight into its biological

functions. Although alternative mRNA subforms have
never been described for any member of the Cbf5/mfl/
DKC1 family, transcripts that have very low abundance, or
are expressed in selected cell types or in response to specific stimuli, may have escaped analysis. Indeed, rare
products have important roles in many physiological
processes and can often trigger crucial responses to developmental or growth stimuli. The detailed analyses of the
mfl gene reported here show that its molecular organization is much more complex than previously suspected and
its coding potential is correspondingly expanded. Indeed,
mfl is the only pseudouridine synthase gene for which
extensive evidence of multiple transcripts has been
reported so far. Our results showed that the canonical
MFL protein can be encoded by three mRNAs distin-

guished solely by 3' end heterogeneity, two of them displaying a maternal pattern. These overlapping 3'-UTRs
may plausibly play a role in imposing different expression
profiles on the mfl mRNAs. In this regard, an intriguing
recent suggestion is that translation of 5'-TOP mRNAs
may become less stringent with increasing 3'-UTR length
[39]. Consistent with this notion, it could be surmised
that the diverse lengths of 3'-UTRs in the 1.8, 2.0 and 2.2
kb mRNAs may per se influence the efficiency of their
translation under different growth conditions; moreover,
the 1.0 kb mRNA is the species for which the most stringent translational regulation should be expected.
The data reported in this paper also reveal that mfl
encodes a novel alternatively-spliced protein subform,

which represents the first example of a variant protein
encoded by any member of the Cbf5 gene family. The
main distinctive trait of this protein, named MFLα, is its
unique C-terminus, where a short tract of 43 amino acids
replaces the large carboxy-terminal moiety of the major
canonical protein, which includes the overlapping PUA
and tyr domains and the bipartite NLS. Given that the
PUA domain of archaeal aCbf5p has recently been shown
to be essential for binding the guide RNAs [29,40], its lack
is predicted to affect this functionally relevant feature,
raising the possibility that MFLα may participate in the
formation of less efficient, or even inactive, H/ACA
snoRNPs. If this were the case, expression of this subform
might have an autoregulatory role in mfl expression. However, we cannot presently exclude the possibility that its

specific C-terminus may allow MFLα to interact with different efficiency or different specificity with distinct protein partners, eventually participating in the assembly of
specific snoRNP subtypes. On the other hand, neither can
we exclude the possibility that this subform has so far
unknown functions, even unrelated to those of the major
canonical protein. Indeed, a further relevant distinctive
trait of MFLα is the absence of the C-terminal NLS. This
might plausibly allow a subtly modified modulation of
the rate of nuclear transport, or of nuclear retention, or of
the subnuclear distribution of the MFLα subform in
response to a various cellular stimuli. In this context, it is
intriguing to note that deletion of the C-terminal lysinerich cluster did not affect the nucleolar location of human
dyskerin, but influenced the rate of transport into the

BMC Molecular Biology 2007, 8:15

nucleus [41], while truncation of the C-terminal basic
domain of yeast Cbf5p led to delay at the G2/M phase of
the cell cycle [19].
Finally, we noticed that the MFL C-terminal moiety
deleted in MFLα is particularly rich in putative phosphorylation sites. Since many cellular processes are controlled
in a phosphorylation-and cell cycle-dependent manner,
including protein synthesis and cell division, it is conceivable that MFL and MFLα may respond in different ways to
various growth conditions and cellular signals.
An unexpected and distinctive peculiarity of MFLα concerns its greater accumulation in adult females. Although
this sex-biased expression suggests that the subform is
required during oogenesis and in the early stages of Drosophila development, it would be premature to exclude
the possibility that its expression may be identical in both
sexes at different developmental stages, or that a sharply
restricted or a transient expression profile may have hindered its detection in adult males. Indeed, the data
reported in this paper show that higher levels of expression in females are a general feature of mfl transcripts,
either coding or non-coding, the only exception being the
1.8 kb constitutive mRNA, which has the same abundance
in both sexes [7]. This observation adds further strength to
a recent report that included mfl/Nop60b among the list of
Drosophila genes that are significantly more strongly
expressed in purified female germline stem cells [42]. It is
also worth noting that the levels of all mfl transcripts peak
at the major sites of cell growth and division during the
Drosophila life cycle – late embryos, larvae and adult ovaries – making it plausible that gene expression might be
linked to the rate of cell growth and proliferation. This
hypothesis is compatible with the essential role in ribosome biogenesis [7] and with recent microarray analyses
that indicated mfl/Nop60b to be a major target of d-myc
induction [43]. In this light, the different levels of MFLα
expression between male and female adult flies may only
be coincidental, simply reflecting the different rates of
protein synthesis in adult flies of different sexes. Although
further experiments are required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that regulate mfl expression, the intriguing pattern displayed by snm60 molecules (the production
of which appears to be coupled to that of the 2.2 and 1.0
kb mRNAs) in proliferating intestine cells is also in good
agreement with this view.
The complex molecular organization described here for
mfl may be of general relevance, possibly unravelling
aspects common to other orthologues. Although no variant DKC1 transcript has been characterized thus far in
mammals, it is intriguing that deletion and splice site
mutations in the last exon of the gene have been found in
DC patients [44,45], and that a small deletion covering

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/15

only the last DKC1 exon proved to be lethal in mouse
knock-out experiments [12]. Together, these observations
indicate that the 3' portion of the gene is also highly biologically relevant in mammals. Moreover, DKC1 -deleted
alleles triggered early lethality only when they occurred on
the maternal allele, revealing the existence of a maternal
effect in the transmission of DC disease [12]. It is tempting to speculate that, similarly to mfl, mammalian DKC1
genes may encode still-undetected transcripts, the expression of which may account for this sex-specific effect.
Our data also show that mfl introns harbour a variegated
cluster of small ncRNA genes comprising an H/ACA
snoRNA gene, four copies of the C/D snoRNA DmSnR60
and two copies of the small ncRNA of unknown function.
The structure of this dense cluster conforms to the one
ncRNA gene per intron rule widely observed in animal
genomes, and strongly implies that several duplication
events have occurred during its evolution. This coding/
non-coding genetic arrangement has obvious regulatory
potential: to coordinate the expression of nested ncRNAs
with the protein products of the gene. Common functional roles are often shared by host genes and intronencoded ncRNAs. In the case of mfl, the snoRNA H1 and
DmSnR60 isoforms share obvious ribosome-related functions with their protein-coding host gene; they modify
highly conserved residues on the 18S and 28S rRNAs,
respectively. However, it is presently unclear whether the
snm60 molecules represent functional entities, so their
functional correlation with mfl, if any, remains to be
proved. Nevertheless, the fine regulation of snm60 argues
against the idea that they merely represent transcriptional
noise. Even though these ncRNAs may be involved in the
same pathway as mfl, the possibility that they may have
totally unrelated functions cannot presently be excluded.
In this case, it is conceivable that mfl may have been chosen as host merely to meet the need for a transcription rate
high enough to produce a sufficient level of these molecules. Systematic mutagenic approaches are currently
underway to address the biological role of these ncRNAs,
and to determine the degree, if any, to which they contribute to the mfl phenotype. In any case, it is interesting to
note that mammalian DKC1 genes have also been shown
to host two intron-encoded H/ACA snoRNAs [34], indicating that the coding/non-coding genetic architecture
may represent an additional conserved feature shared by
these highly related orthologues.

Conclusion
We report here that the Drosophila gene encoding pseudouridine synthase has a complex coding/non-coding
structure. We have provided evidence that the use of different 3' end sites enables this gene not only to produce
different mRNAs but also to release distinct sets of small
intron-encoded ncRNAs, suggesting a potential novel role

BMC Molecular Biology 2007, 8:15

for overlapping 3'UTRs. Our data also reveal that a minor
variant mRNA able to encode a distinct protein subform
can be produced by this gene, suggesting that alternative
splicing may have a role in regulating the expression of
eukaryotic pseudouridine synthases.

Methods
DNA analysis and cloning techniques
Basic cloning techniques, PCR amplification, DNA and
RNA extraction, manipulation and labeling, screening
and sequencing techniques were carried out according to
Sambrook and Russell [46]. All PCR-amplified fragments
and 5' and 3' RACE products were cloned by using the
pMOSBlue blunt ended cloning kit (Amersham Biosciences) and automatically sequenced (Primm).
RNA analysis
After disruption and homogenization, total RNA was
extracted from flies at various developmental stages, manually dissected ovaries or cultured S2 cells, using TRIzol
Reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Concentration, purity, and quality
of the RNA were determined using the Hitachi U-1500
spectrophotometer at 260 nm and 280 nm and by gel
electrophoresis. Polyadenylated RNA was selected by
using oligo-dT polystyrene beads (GenElute™ mRNA Miniprep Kit, Sigma-Aldrich). For Northern blot analysis, 5 μg
of poly(A)+ RNA or 10 μg of total RNA were electrophoresed and transferred to Hybond-NX filters (Amersham Biosciences) for hybridization. DNA probes were
32P-labeled using the Nick Translation Kit (Roche). Probes
1, 2 and 3 utilised in Northern blot analyses corresponded, respectively, to a 0.1 kb PCR-amplified genomic
fragment generated with the oligonucleotides 5'-CACAAGAAACTTAAGGTGTG-3' and 5'- GATGTCTTGGGCAGTGTTGTACC-3' (probe 1), a 0.2 kb PCR-amplified genomic
fragment generated with the oligonucleotides 5'-GAGGTAAATATTTAATAACTAAAAG- 3' and 5'-GATTCCTGTGGCATTCAATG-3' (probe 2), and a 0.6 kb PCR-amplified
genomic fragment generated with the oligonucleotides 5'CAAGCCTCAATCTTTTCGATTGCCTTTC-3' and 5'-GATGTCTTGGGCAGTGTTGTACC-3' (probe 3). The amount
of RNA loaded in each lane was checked by hybridization
with a probe derived from the gene coding for the
αTub84B gene.

For 3'-RACE experiments, a first reverse transcription step
was performed using an oligo dT with adapter sequence at
its 5'-end (5'-GACTCGAGTCGACATCGA(T)17-3'). Amplification was then performed using a set of sense primers
derived from the sequences of exon 5 (5'-GACCATGGTGTGGTGG-3'), exon 6 (5'-CTCTATCGCTAGTTTCTTAGGTCTTAGC-3'),
exon
8
(5'CTTCGAATAAACATAGGAATTAAGGTAAG-3') and exon
9 (5'-GGTCATGCAATATATGGACTATAAC-3'), all in asso-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/15

ciation with the adapter primer (5'-GACTCGAGTCGACATCG -3') used in first reverse-transcription step. In 5' RACE experiments, 300 ng of female poly(A)+ RNA were
reverse transcribed using a splicing-specific primer spanning exon 3–9 junction (5'-CCTAATCAACAAATCCATATTTCGGG-3') to amplify the 5' region of the
alternatively spliced transcript. An A-tailing step was carried out to attach an oligo-dA tail to the 3' end of the
cDNA with terminal transferase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and specific cDNAs were then amplified by
two rounds of PCR. The first round was performed with a
gene-specific primer from exon 3 (5'-GGGCACCACGCAGCTTCTC-3') and the same oligodT-adaptor primer
used in 3' RACE experiments, while in the second reaction
we used a nested primer from exon 3 (5'-GGGACTTCACCAGACGGG-3') and the same adaptor primer previously
described for 3' RACE. The amplification products
obtained (500 bp) were cloned into the pMOSblue vector
and sequenced. To clone MFLα cDNA, the partially overlapping PCR products of the 3' and 5' RACE experiments
described above were digested at the common BamH1 site
present at exon 2 and fused in a ligase reaction (T4 DNAligase USB) to compose a virtual full length cDNA
sequence. The reconstituted cDNA sequence was cloned
into the pMOSblue vector and sequenced to check
absence of internal stop codons.
For RT-PCR, we utilised poly(A)+ RNA preparations from
male and female adult flies and various combinations of
upstream primers derived from exon 2 (primer P1: 5'CTTCCAAATCAAGCCCTCCTCCAAG-3'), exon 5 (5'GCCAGCAGCTCAAGAAGTCTCCCC-3') and exon 6 (5'GTGTAGAAGTGCATACAAATTAC-3') with downstream
primers derived from exon 10 (5'-GATTCCTGTGGCATTCAATG-3'), exon 11 (5'-GCAATAAAGTGTCATGCG-3')
and exon 12 (primer P2: 5'- GATGTCTTGGGCAGTGTTGTACC-3').
To confirm presence of the alternatively spliced mRNA, in
order to avoid amplification from genomic DNA contamination we utilised a common 5' primer from exon 2
(primer P1) in combination with two 3' primers spanning
splicing specific exon-exon junction (primer P3, spanning
exon 3–9 junction: 5'-CCTAATCAACAAATCCATATTTCGGG-3'; primer P4, spanning exon 5–6 junction: 5'GGTGCTTAACTTGCGTTTGCTGGG-3'). As control of the
RNA quantity we also reverse-amplified in each sample
the αTub84B gene transcript, using a forward primer
derived
from
exon
1
(5'-GTGAAACACTTCCAATAAAAACTCAATATG-3') in combination with a
reverse primer derived from exon 2 (5'-CCAGCAGGCGTTTCCAAT-3'). The amplified DNA products were
analysed on 1.5% agarose gel, eluted and purified before
cloning and sequencing.

GenBank accession numbers
The nucleotide sequence of the 2.2 kb and the 1.0 kb
mRNAs have been submitted to the GenBank database
under accession numbers DQ857345 and DQ 857346,
respectively. GenBank accession numbers of the nucleotide sequences of snm60 a and b isoforms are DQ142641

are found in the GenBank database under the accession
number AY805216. SnoH1 sequence is found in GenBank
at the AF089836 number, while mfl genomic sequence is
found in GenBank at AF097634. MFL amino acid
sequence is available at the GenBank accession number
AAD19897.
Quantitative Real Time RT-PCR (qPCR)
Poly(A)+ RNA (800 ng) was reverse transcribed using 250
ng random hexamers, 100 U SSII reverse transcriptase, 10
mM DTT, and 1X First-Strand Buffer (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) at 42°C for one hour in a volume of 20 μL
(Mycycler, BioRad, 8 Hercules, CA). Quantitative analysis
was performed by using the iQ™ 5 Multicolor Real-Time
PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad). The PCR reactions were
performed in a final volume of 15 microliters using 1
microliter of cDNA, 5 pmol of each primer and 7.5 microliter of iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix 2X (Bio-Rad). PCR
cycling profile consisted of a cycle at 95°C for 3 min and
40 two-step cycles at 95°C for 10 s and at 60° C for 30 s.
Quantitative real time PCR analysis was carried out using
the 2(-Delta Delta C(T)) method (2-ΔΔCt) [47]. Primers
were chosen using Primer Express 2.0 software (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, CA) for optimum use in qPCR. A
BLASTN search was performed against GenBank to ensure
that all primers were unique to the gene of interest. To
avoid amplification from genomic DNA contamination,
all primer sets derived from different gene exons or
spanned a specific exon-exon junction (see below). In all
qPCR experiments the data were normalized to the
expression of the Drosophila αTub84B housekeeping
gene. Negative controls included omission of template
dissociation curves, gel analysis and sequencing of certain
PCR products confirmed gene specific product amplification. PCR oligo-primers were: mfl Ex 3 forward primer: 5'GTTGCGCGTTCGTACTGTCTAC-3'; mfl Ex 4 reverse

Ex 2 reverse primer 5'-CCAGCAGGCGTTTCCAAT -3'.
Three different RNA preparations were tested for each
sample, and each reaction was run in triplicate. Data are
representative of three independent experiments.
Detection of ribose-methylated nucleotides
rRNA 2'-O-ribose methylation was determined by reverse
transcription at low dNTP concentration essentially as
described by Maden et al. [35].
Antibodies and immunochemistry
Two peptides, peptide 1 (N2H-CADVEVRKEKKKKKI KCONH2) and peptide 2 (N2H-CHG SSPLNRDIKEYH KCONH2), were synthesized. These peptides were selected
from tracts of the N-terminal region common to MFL and
MFLα proteins that are not highly conserved between species. Both peptides contained an extra cysteine on N-terminus to aid in affinity purification and were conjugated
(to keyhole limpet hemacyanin, mixed together). Polyclonal antibodies against these two peptides were produced
by injection of rabbits (Eurogentec, EGT group) and used
in Western blot analyses after 1:500 dilution in TBS
tween. Chemiluminescent detection was performed using
HRP conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich)
diluted 1:5000 and subsequently detected by a film exposure. The ECL-Advance™ Western Blotting Detection Reagents (Amersham Biosciences) were used. The protein
ladder used in our experiments was the Precision Plus
Prestained Protein Standard Dual Colour (Biorad Laboratories).
In situ hybridization
Whole mount in situ hybridization was performed using
single-stranded DIG-labeled probes obtained by PCR, as
described previously [7]. Preparations were observed
through a microscope model Eclipse E1000, Nikon, with
plan fluor Phl20x/0.50 objective lenses. The microscope
was equipped with a digital camera (Nikon model DXM
1200 F) and with Nikon ACT1 acquisition software.

Authors' contributions
SR designed and performed most of the experiments; she
carried out the Northern and bioinformatic analyses, 5'
and 3' RACE, RT-PCR, 2'-O-methylation mapping and in
situ hybridization experiments, took care of handling the
Drosophila, and helped to organize the data and draft the
manuscript. GT prepared the cell extracts and performed
the western analyses. EG helped to map the 2'-O-methylations on rRNA, participated in the bioinformatic analyses and gave useful suggestions. MT carried out the S2 cell
culture and RT quantitative PCR experiments and contrib-
