Abstract
Background: Soil bacteria from the genus Rhizobium are characterized by a complex genomic architecture
comprising chromosome and large plasmids. Genes responsible for symbiotic interactions with legumes are usually
located on one of the plasmids, named the symbiotic plasmid (pSym). The plasmids have a great impact not only
on the metabolic potential of rhizobia but also underlie genome rearrangements and plasticity.
Results: Here, we analyzed the distribution and sequence variability of markers located on chromosomes and
extrachromosomal replicons of Rhizobium leguminosarum bv. trifolii strains originating from nodules of clover
grown in the same site in cultivated soil. First, on the basis of sequence similarity of repA and repC replication
genes to the respective counterparts of chromids reported in R. leguminosarum bv. viciae 3841 and R. etli CFN42,
chromid-like replicons were distinguished from the pool of plasmids of the nodule isolates studied. Next, variability
of the gene content was analyzed in the different genome compartments, i.e., the chromosome, chromid-like and
‘other plasmids’. The stable and unstable chromosomal and plasmid genes were detected on the basis of
hybridization data. Displacement of a few unstable genes between the chromosome, chromid-like and ‘other
plasmids’, as well as loss of some markers was observed in the sampled strains. Analyses of chosen gene
sequences allowed estimation of the degree of their adaptation to the three genome compartments as well as to
the host.
Conclusions: Our results showed that differences in distribution and sequence divergence of plasmid and
chromosomal genes can be detected even within a small group of clover nodule isolates recovered from clovers
grown at the same site. Substantial divergence of genome organization could be detected especially taking into
account the content of extrachromosomal DNA. Despite the high variability concerning the number and size of
plasmids among the studied strains, conservation of the location as well as dynamic distribution of the individual
genes (especially replication genes) of a particular genome compartment were demonstrated. The sequence
divergence of particular genes may be affected by their location in the given genome compartment. The ‘other
plasmid’ genes are less adapted to the host genome than the chromosome and chromid-like genes.

Background
Rhizobia are widely occurring soil bacteria that are able
to establish nitrogen-fixing symbioses with legumes.
Bacterium-plant interaction is a complex process in
which specific plant and bacterial signals are exchanged
resulting in formation of nodules, where rhizobia in the
form of bacteroids fix nitrogen [1-3].

Rhizobial genomes are large and multipartite, composed of a single circular chromosome and a set of large
plasmids [4-6]. The genes responsible for nodulation
(nod) and nitrogen-fixation (nif-fix) are either carried by
large plasmids (pSym) or are incorporated in the chromosome as symbiotic islands [7,8]. Large genomes of
Rhizobiaceae and Bradyrhizobiaceae (above 6-9 Mb) are
considered more ecologically advantageous in an environment that is scarce in nutrients but diverse as regards
carbon and energy sources. These genomes are disproportionately enriched in regulation and transport genes
and in genes involved in secondary metabolism in

comparison with medium-and small-size genome
containing bacteria [9].
“Core” and “accessory” components of Rhizobium
genomes can be distinguished. Chromosomes with conserved gene content and order (synteny) are considered
as core. Accordingly, plasmids constitute the accessory
genome. Plasmids are more flexible than the chromosomes, as defined by more frequent gene gains and
losses, even in the same species. They are heterogeneous
in size and gene content and lack synteny even in closely related species, except for genes involved in plasmid
replication and symbiotic properties [6,10,11]. In some
species, such as Rhizobium leguminosarum, plasmids
may comprise up to 35% of the total genome [6,7].
Rhizobial plasmids are maintained in the cells via
repABC cassettes, comprising genes required for active
segregation (repAB) and initiation of replication (repC)
[12]. The presence of several repABC operons within a
single genome, which are subjected to individual selection pressure and divergence, could be the key element
of the existence of different plasmid incompatibility
groups in cells and could drive the rearrangement of
gene organization and of their functions [11,13-15]. It
was proposed that repABC plasmids coexisting in the
same strain most probably emerged by separate events
of lateral transfer, which required evolution of different
incompatibility groups allowing simultaneous residence
of plasmids equipped with a similar replication/partition
system in a single bacterial species [12]. Thus, the
degree of divergence of the plasmid replication apparatus, whose sequence is subject to strong evolutionary
pressure and determines the ability to evade incompatibility between plasmids [13], and horizontal gene transfers are potential forces that shaped rhizobial genomes.
Recently, some (not only rhizobial) extrachromosomal
replicons that have properties distinct from both chromosome and plasmids were reported and named “chromids” [16]. Chromids are characterized by presence of
some important genes essential for growth under all
conditions, with nucleotide composition and codon
usage similar to the chromosome of the parental strain,
and, by contrast, plasmid replication and partition systems [16].
Furthermore, recent analyses of Rhizobium etli strains
[11] showed that this species has a pangenomic structure. By definition, a pangenome “determines the core
genome, which consists of genes shared by all the
strains studied and probably encoding functions related
to the basic biology and phenotypes of the species” [17].
The basis of the pangenome concept emerged from an
observation that each newly sequenced genome enriched
the pool of species-specific genes with new ones [17,18].
This makes it possible to detect, besides the core genomes, the dispensable genomes composed of both

Page 2 of 15

chromosomal and plasmid genes, present only in some
of the strains, which contribute to the species diversity
and allow adaptation to new ecological niches and a
specific environment. Despite the overall genomic divergence, R. etli pangenome comprises a core genome
composed of both chromosomal and plasmid sequences,
as well as highly conserved symbiosis-related genes on
the pSym plasmid. The unusual variability observed in
rhizobial genomes may further result from several types
of alterations, such as point mutations, deletions, amplification of DNA, and from intragenome re-assortment
of sequences [19-21].
The aim of this study was to evaluate the divergence
of genomes of a small population of R. leguminosarum
bv. trifolii (Rlt) nodule isolates from clover plants grown
in the same site in cultivated soil. Like the other members of the genus Rhizobium, the Rlt genomes were partitioned into the chromosome and several large
plasmids, one of which carried symbiosis-related genes.
The variability of the genome architecture involved not
only the number and size of the plasmids, but also the
location of specific genes on the particular replicons.
Distribution of repABC operon markers and other genes
in the three genome compartments: the chromosome,
chromid-like and ‘other plasmids’ was assessed. We
found “stable” genes that were permanently located in a
specific genome compartment, as well as “unstable”
ones, which were detected in different replicons of the
sampled strains. Sequences of selected chromosome and
plasmid genes were subjected to an assessment of adaptation to a particular genome compartment by analyses
of codon usage and codon adaptation index. A potential
evolutionary pathway of Rlt strains was proposed on the
basis of gene sequences and their distribution.

Methods
R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii (Rlt) strains

129 R. leguminosarum isolates were obtained from
nodules of red clover (Trifolium pratense L. cv. Dajana)
growing in sandy loam (N:P:K 0.157:0.014:0.013%).
Plants were grown on 1 m2 plot for six weeks between
May and June 2008. Afterwards, ten randomly chosen
clover plants growing in each other’s vicinity were harvested, the nodules were collected, surface-sterilized,
crushed and their content plated on 79CA medium [22].
Strains isolated from the nodules were purified by successive streaking of single colonies and pure cultures
were used in further experiments.
DNA methods

Standard techniques were used for labeling of DNA,
Southern hybridization and agarose gel electrophoresis
[23]. DNA probes for Southern hybridizations were
obtained by PCR amplification with RtTA1 genomic

DNA as template and appropriate primers (Table 1).
The probes were labeled with non-radioactive DIG
DNA Labeling and Detection Kit (Roche). Southern
blotting, gel pretreatment and capillary transfers were
done using standard procedures [23]. Hybridizations
were performed at high stringency at 42°C using 50%
formamide in pre-hybridization and hybridization
solutions. Analyses of the plasmid content of the 129
isolates were performed as described by Eckhardt [24].
Preparation of high molecular weight DNA and PFGE
conditions

The plugs were formed with 5 ml 48 h culture of Rlt
strains, which after centrifugation were resuspended in
TE buffer and mixed with 2% LMP agarose (Sigma).
Agarose embedded cells were incubated with TE and
lysozyme (1.5 mg/ml) for 16 h at 37°C, and then in cell
lysis buffer (1% sodium lauryl sarcosine, 50 mM EDTA,
50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) supplemented with proteinase
K (0.5 mg/ml) at 37°C for additional 48 h. The proteinase K was inactivated by PMSF (0.4 mg/ml) at 37°C for
1 h. Plugs were washed tree times (30 min) with TE
buffer and finally stored in TE at 4°C. PFGE was performed with the contour-clamped homogenous electric
field mode with the Bio-Rad system (model CHEFDRIII). DNA samples were separated in 1% Megabase
agarose gels (Bio-Rad) in 1 × TAE buffer, refrigerated at
12-14°C, with switch time 100-300 seconds, angle 106°,
voltage gradient 3 V/cm for 48 h. Estimation of plasmid
size was performed with BIO-PROFIL BioGene (VilberLourmat, France), using R. leguminosarum bv. viciae
strain 3841 [6], R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii TA1
[25,26] and Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 [4].
Computer assisted analyses

Sequence data were analyzed with Lasergene analysis
software (DNASTAR, Inc). Data base searches were
done with the BLAST and FASTA programs at the
National Centre for Biotechnology Information
(Bethesda, Md) and European Bioinformatic Institute
(Hinxton, UK). For the DNA sequences multiple alignments Clustal-W algorithm was used [27]. Codon usage
of sequenced genes was calculated using ACUA [28].
Codon adaptation index (CAI) was calculated with cai

program [29]. In codon usage discriminant analyses with
two grouping methods were applied to studied
sequences: (a) based on the localization of genes in
defined part of the rhizobial genome (three groups:
chromosome, chromid-like, and other plasmids), or (b)
based on the origin of the genes (13 groups-each for
one strain). The results of this multivariate analysis give
us the information about separation of studied groups
on the basis of discriminant functions i.e. linear combinations of studied variables maximizing distances
between groups and orthogonal to each other [30].
For every grouping method set of variables included
the relative frequency of alternative codons (for the
same aminoacids), leading to the investigation of 59
variables (omitting stop codons and codons for methionine and tryptophan, which have no alternatives).
Complete discriminant analysis was performed but from
among many obtained results we focused on Chi-squared
test providing the number of statistically significant discriminant functions, squared Mahalanobis distances between
the group centroids (taking into account the correlation
between variables), scatterplots of discriminant scores i.e.
cases located in the property space formed by first two discriminant functions [31] as well as the classification table
containing information about the number and percent of
correctly classified cases in each group.
The application of discriminant analysis was preceded
by tolerance test, which enable us to remove redundant
variables out of the model [32]. The tolerance tests were
performed using Classify/Discriminant unit of SPSS software (SPSS for Windows version 10.0, 1999, SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) while other results were obtained
using Discriminant Function Analysis units of STATISTICA software system (Statistica version 6, 2001, StatSoft Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA).

Results
Strain selection based on variable genomic organization

A group of 23 isolates was selected from among a collection of 129 R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii (Rlt) isolates
recovered from nodules of ten clover plants grown in
the vicinity of each other in cultivated soil. The main
criterion of strain selection, beside the ability of effective
nodulation of clover (Trifolium pratense), was their different plasmid pattern obtained by Eckhardt’s lysis procedure (Figure 1A). The strains harbored from 3 to 6
plasmids whose size, as assessed by PFGE analysis of
high molecular weight (HMW) genomic DNA, ranged
approximately from 150 kb to 1380 kb (Table 2, Figure 1B).
The plasmids will be referred to as pRlea to pRlef throughout this report. The isolates that differed in the plasmid
pattern were assumed to be distinct strains. In all the
strains studied, the single symbiotic plasmid (pSym), with
average molecular weight of 361 kb (ranging from 260 kb
to 500 kb) was identified by Southern hybridization with
nodA and nifNE probes, derived from the R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii TA1 (RtTA1) laboratory strain [26]. A set
of 24 strains (including RtTA1) with a highly variable number and size of plasmids was chosen for further hybridization assays. Noteworthy is the presence of very large
plasmids with molecular weight above 1.0 Mb, identified in
a majority of the sampled strains (Figure 1).
Average molecular weight (m.w.) of all the plasmids in
each of the 23 isolates was calculated as 2.815 Mb (ranging from 1.89 to 3.25 Mb). With regard to the average
genome size ~7.145 Mb of recently sequenced R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii WSM2304 (Rlt2304) and
WSM1325 (Rlt1325) [33,34], in which extrachromosomal replicons constitute 34% and 36%, respectively, the
extrachromosomal DNA content in our strains was calculated to range from 26% to 45% (an average ~39%).
Similarity of replication-partition genes in the plasmid
pool of selected strains

One of the methods to assess the phylogenetic relatedness among plasmids is to compare their replication systems. Thus, at the beginning of our study, similarity
and/or diversity of replication regions between the plasmids of the nodule isolates were examined. Recently,
the replication systems of four plasmids (pRleTA1apRleTA1d), each equipped with repABC genes, were
analyzed in RtTA1 [35]. An experimental approach
comprising a series of Southern hybridizations with
repA and repC genes derived from plasmids pRleTA1apRleTA1d of RtTA1 as molecular probes was used
(Table 1). The repA and repC genes were PCR amplified
from the RtTA1 genome and probed against PFGE-

separated HMW DNA of the sampled strains. The
choice of two different genes from each of the replication system identified in RtTA1 as molecular probes
seemed to be justified by lack of single universal phylogenetic history within the repABC operon and by RepA
and RepB evolution, partially independent from RepC
[13].
Distribution of the given rep marker was assessed with
regard to its location in one of the extrachromosomal
replicons of the tested strains. repA and repC genes of
the largest pRleTA1d were jointly detected on the largest plasmids in all the sampled Rlt strains (Figure 2).
Similarly, repA and repC of the pRleTA1b jointly hybridized to one of the plasmids of different size in all the
Rlt strains. In contrast, repA and repC of the pRleTA1c
were rarely localized together (4 of 23 strains). The repA
of the pRleTA1c was not similar to any of the plasmids
in most of the sampled strains, but repC hybridized frequently (19 of 23 strains) to pSym plasmids. repA and
repC of pRleTA1a (pSym) commonly showed sequence
similarity to non-symbiotic plasmids of the sampled
strains and only exceptionally hybridized to symbiotic
ones (Figure 2).
RepABC of pRleTA1d and pRleTA1b display similarity
with replication systems of the extrachromosomal replicons, which were recently described as chromids
[16,35]. Within the group of closely related strains

of replicons carrying the most similar replication systems can be distinguished. They comprise pRleTA1dpRL12-p42f-pRLG201-pR132501 and pRleTA1b-pRL11p42e-pRLG202-pR132502, respectively. Therefore, detection of positive hybridization signals with probes derived
from rep genes of RtTA1 chromid-like replicons (i.e.
pRleTA1b or pRleTA1d) to any of the replicons of the
sampled strains allowed regarding those as a chromidlike. Based on the similarity of replication-partition
genes detected in our assays, we divided the replicons of
the studied strains into three genome compartments:
chromosome, chromid-like and ‘other plasmids’ (i.e.
those replicons which gave a hybridization signal with
molecular probes originating from repA and repC genes
of pRleTA1a or pRleTA1c, as well as those that gave no
signal with any rep probes of RtTA1 replication genes).
The compartment designated ‘other plasmids’ also comprised pSym. Such replicon division was taken into consideration in the subsequent analyses of distribution of
other markers in the studied strains.
Variability of chromosomal and plasmid marker location

In further studies, the extent of gene content diversity in
the sampled nodule isolates was examined. We aimed to
estimate whether, besides repA and repC displacement

events, we could demonstrate changes in the location of
the chromosomal and plasmid genes. The same experimental approach was used, i.e. a series of Southern
hybridizations with different genes with a well-defined
chromosomal or plasmid location in RtTA1 (Table 1)
[36].
For assays of chromosomal marker variability, essential
bacterial genes were chosen: rpoH2, dnaK, dnaC, rrn,
lpxQ as well as genes that are not essential or with
unspecified essentiality but chromosomal in RtTA1, i.e.
bioA, stbB, exoR, pssL (Pss-I) and rfbADBC (Pss-V)
(Table 1). In addition, location of fixGH genes was
assayed, even though they are known to be plasmid

located on the sequenced RltWSM2304, RltWSM1325
[33,34], Rlv [6] and Rhe [5] genomes, but chromosomal
in RtTA1 [36].
A majority of the studied genes (rpoH2, dnaK, dnaC,
rrn, lpxQ, bioA, stbB, exoR and pssL) were located on
the chromosome in all the sampled strains, showing
considerable conservation of chromosomal markers (Figure 3). Exceptionally, the Pss-V region was identified on
the chromosome of the K3.6, K5.4 and RtTA1 but it
was missing in the other strains (Figure 3) Moreover,
fixGH symbiosis-related genes, which were chromosomal in the RtTA1, K3.6, K4.15 and K5.4 strains, were
located mainly in the genome compartment designated

as ‘other plasmids’ (pSym to be exact) in the remaining
strains. The variable location of fixGH genes which were
found on the chromosome, pSyms and chromid-like
replicons (K12.5) could be accounted for by location of
these genes on the putative genomic island flanked by
18 bp repeats in R. leguminosarum and R. etli [10,37].
Southern hybridizations with probes comprising markers
previously identified on different RtTA1 replicons [36],
such as prc and hlyD of pRleTA1d; lpsB2, orf16-orf17-otsB,
tauA and orf14 genes cluster of pRleTA1c; nadA and pssM
(surface polysaccharide synthesis region Pss-III) of pRleTA1b, were carried out. These analyses demonstrated that
pRleTA1d markers were almost always jointly detected in
the largest chromid-like replicons (only in K3.22 and K5.4
they are separated between distinct chromid-like replicons). pRleTA1c markers in almost all (21 out of 23) of the
sampled strains were located in the genome compartment
designated as ‘other plasmids’ (Figure 3). From among
markers of pRleTA1b, nadA, minD, hutI and pcaG had
always chromid-like location, while the pssM gene was
located in the chromosome of 19 strains, in chromid-like
replicons of four strains including RtTA1, and was absent
in the genome of K3.22 strain, respectively (Figure 3).

Besides the symbiotic genes nodA and nifNE used for
identification of pSym plasmids, stability of thiC and
acdS (Table 1) of the pRleTA1a symbiotic plasmid (ipso
facto described as markers of the ‘other plasmids’ pool)
was examined (Figure 3). Only thiC was identified in all
the strains, however, located in different genomic compartments: most frequently on the chromosome (18 of
23 strains), and in the ‘other plasmids’ (5 strains). The
acdS gene was detected in 14 of 23 strains, in each case
on pSym (Figure 3). The thiC gene, similarly to fixGHI,
showed high variability in location; however, its putative
mobile element location is unknown [38]. thiC was
reported as plasmid located in sequenced genomes of
Rlv [6], Rlt2304 [33] and Rhe [5].
As a result, genes with a stable location in specific
genome compartments in all the strains, as well as
unstable genes with variable, strain-dependent distribution were distinguished (Figure 4). Stable markers for
each compartment of the sampled strains were established i.e. chromosomal: rpoH2, exoR, dnaK, dnaC, bioA,
rrn, lpxQ, pssL and stbB; chromid-like: prc, hlyD, nadA,
minD, hutI and pcaG; ‘other plasmids’: otsB, lpsB2
(exceptionally chromid-like in K3.6), tauA and orf14
(exceptionally chromid-like in K3.12) including nodA
and nifNE symbiosis-related genes of pSym (Figure 4).
Loss of some of the examined markers was noticed, i.e.
Pss-V from the chromosome, pssM from chromid-like
replicons, and acdS from the ‘other plasmids’ (pSym).
Only two of the sampled strains, i.e. K3.6 and K5.4, contained all the studied markers, while others lacked at
least one of the genes.
A dendrogram demonstrating similarity of the strains
was constructed with the UPGMA clustering method
based on markers distribution among their different
genome compartments. It showed one K3.6 strain
apparently split from the others (Figure 5), and two
groups of clustered strains: a small one, including
RtTA1, K5.4 and K4.15, and a large one comprising the
remaining strains, which was further subdivided into
two smaller subgroups of strains with identical marker
distribution (Figure 5).
Sequence divergence of chromosomal and plasmid genes

To assess the overall phylogenetic similarity of the
sampled strains, several genes from a subset of 12 different strains displaying divergent plasmid profiles (plus
RtTA1) were partially sequenced and analyzed. The
sequenced genes comprised exclusively chromosomal
(dnaC, dnaK, exoR, rpoH2), chromid-like replicons
(hlyD, prc, nadA), and ‘other plasmid’ markers (nodA,
nifNE) as well as those with unstable location found in
different genome compartments (fixGH, thiC, lpsB2).
Afterwards, phylogenetic trees were constructed based
on concatenated sequences of a distinct genome

compartment, allowing description of the genetic similarity of the strains using the multilocus sequences analyses (MLSA) approach (Figure 6).
In general, a low number of nucleotide substitutions
were found in the examined genes in most strains. Similar groups of clustered strains were obtained in dendrograms constructed both on the basis of concatenated
chromosomal sequences (Figure 6A), as well as concatenated chromid-like replicon genes (Figure 6B). In both
cases, a smaller group containing RtTA1, K4.15 and
K3.6 strains, and a larger group consisting of the
remaining strains was observed. Interestingly, K3.22
chromosomal genes split off from all remaining strains
suggesting their considerable divergence (Figure 6B).
Sequence similarity within the RtTA1, K4.15 and K3.6
group is also visible on a dendrogram exclusively based
on plasmid gene sequences, derived from pSym (Figure
6C). When all the concatenated sequences (comprising
genes with stable and unstable location in the genome)
were used in dendrogram construction, the grouping of
the strains was very similar to that obtained on the basis
of stable chromosomal markers (Figure 6A, D). In conclusion, quite a similar phylogenetic history of the

studied strains was demonstrated based on both stable
and unstable chromosomal, chromid-like as well as
‘other plasmid’ genes (despite the small number of the
markers analyzed).
To further evaluate the degree of sequence differentiation between the alleles with respect to their distribution
in the genome and eo ipso the rate of adaptation to the
genome compartment, we performed discrimination
analyses focused on alternative codon usage. Discrimination analysis was applied to 59 variables (all potential
triplets except for stop and non-alternative codons Met,
Trp). Genes belonging to the chromosome, chromid-like
and ‘other plasmids’ differed substantially with respect
to this parameter (Figure 7A). Apart from the well-separated sequences belonging to the three distinct genome
compartments, one can observe a subgroup localized
between chromosomal and ‘other plasmids’ gene pools
(Figure 7A). This subgroup comprised genes thiC,
fixGH, which frequently changed their location and their
codon usage was not adapted to any genome compartment. Comparison of the results of gene grouping based
on hybridization data and discrimination analysis
demonstrated very high accordance equal to 96%.

The discrimination analysis of codon usage performed

genes (13 groups of sequences) revealed only minor differences between the resultant groups and almost no
accordance (31%) with the grouping performed on the
basis of hybridization. However, some level of similarity
between the strains can be demonstrated. As a consequence, one more discrimination analysis of codon
usage was done, and the strains were divided into three

groups: (i) K3.22, (ii) RtTA1, K3.6, K4.15 and (iii) all the
remaining strains (Figure 7B). This resulted in 92%
accordance between codon usage-based and straindependent grouping of sequences (Figure 7B and Figure
6D). It was concluded that codon usage was not significantly influenced by the individual strains but may be
characteristic for the group of strains.
Finally, the Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) of the
sequences studied was calculated. The CAI can be used
to “evaluate the extent to which selection has been
effective in molding the pattern of codon usage” [29] as
well as to compare the codon usage of foreign genes
versus that of highly expressed native genes [13]. Here,
we applied CAI analyses to assess the degree of adaptation of sequenced genes to the host by comparing the
obtained CAI values with those of genes encoding ribosomal proteins in R. leguminosarum. The calculated CAI
values for each sequence were arbitrarily grouped and
subsequently submitted to ANOVA evaluation, which
measures the significance of differences between groups.
CAI values can range from 0 (reflecting use of synonymous codons) to 1 (reflecting the strongest bias where
codon usage is equal to that in the ribosomal proteinencoding genes) [13].
The CAI values ranged from 0.849 (dnaC-chromosomal gene) to 0.554 (nodA-symbiotic gene). The fixG and
thiC had the CAI equal to 0.676 and 0.673, respectively,
suggesting weaker adaptation to their genome compartments and further confirming their unstable location as
indicated in hybridization analyses. We did not find significant differences with respect to the CAI values calculated for the particular strains, but strains RtTA1, K4.15,
K3.6, and K3.22 previously observed as most divergent
had a high average CAI of the studied sequences (from
0.722 to 0.718), possibly indicating good adaptation of
the genes to the host. Finally, the CAI values were evaluated according to the location of genes in the different
genome compartments (Table 3). The CAI values of
genes located on the chromosome and chromid-like
replicons were high and significantly differed from each
other. The genes located on the ‘other plasmids’ (including pSym) had the lowest CAI values significantly different from the former ones. These results demonstrated
weaker adaptation of plasmid genes to the host genome
in comparison to the chromosome and chromid-like
genes.

Discussion
Three genome compartments that differed genetically and
functionally can be distinguished in the nodule population
of R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii: the chromosome, chromid-like and ‘other plasmids’ including pSym. Chromidlike replicons were distinguished in Southern analyses on
the basis of repA and repC sequence similarity to RtTA1

and to the respective replication genes of such replicons
described in the sequenced genomes of R. leguminosarum
bv. viciae, R. etli and R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii [16].
The chosen name “chromid-like” (as opposed to simply
“chromid”) was the result of data scarcity concerning their
gene content, insufficient to justify the name “chromid”
[16]. Moreover, it is known that genes of the repABC
operon are peculiar genetic markers because of the complex phylogeny of particular genes within the operon,
whose evolutionary history could not be strictly connected
with other genes of particular replicons [13].
In the study of the distribution of several chromosomal and plasmid markers within a group of 23 nodule
isolates, stable genes permanently located in a specific

R. leguminosarum bv. trifolii genome compartment:
chromosome, chromid-like and ‘other plasmids’ including pSym were distinguished. Unstable genes (fixGH,
thiC, acdS, pssM and Pss-V region) that changed their
location at various rates or were lost from the genome
were also detected. Only two of the sampled 23 strains
possessed all the studied markers. A majority of strains
differed in the gene content and gene distribution, supporting the hypothesis of the pangenomic structure of
R. leguminosarum, in which each strain of a given species contains, besides the core genome, additional
genetic information specific for the strain [11,17,18,39].
The distribution of the plasmid replication-partition
genes was even more dynamic than that of genes not

connected with replication. Independent transfer events
of repA and repC genes of the putative repABC operon
were frequently observed, especially in the ‘other plasmids’ compartment, which confirmed different evolutionary pathways for various elements of the repABC
operon, recently evidenced in Alphaproteobacteria [13].
Such considerable dynamics of replication/partition gene
distribution in Rhizobium may account for changes in
the plasmid number and, consequently, gene content
observed in the sampled population. Beside the
dynamics of replication/partition gene distribution,
some level of conservation of replication genes, especially those of chromid-like replicons, was also observed.
It was reflected in positive hybridizations with pRleTA1d and pRleTA1b derived rep probes, to the respective replicons of Rlt strains. One could speculate that
the conservation of replication genes of chromid-like
replicons may be related with their distinct properties e.
g. stability. However, the gene content rather than the
properties of the replication system, resulting e.g. from

conservation of replication genes, seem to be crucial for
replicon stability [40].
Redistribution of genes between the different genome
compartments could further trigger their sequence
divergence under different selective pressures [13,15,41].
Examination of sequence divergence of several stable
and unstable chromosomal and plasmid genes showed a
low level of substitutions in genes of all the compartments. Nearly identical nucleotide sequences of nifNE
markers were found in different pSym plasmids of the
studied population (Figure 6C), confirming the core
character of symbiotic genes and their high conservation, despite the overall genome differentiation [11].
The extent of gene adaptation to a given compartment
in the host genome was assessed by analyses of alternative codon usage. Three groups of well separated genes
were obtained corresponding to the chromosome, chromid-like and ‘other plasmids’ genome compartments
(Figure 7A) with 96% accordance with hybridization
data. In conclusion, the sequence divergence of particular genes may be affected by their location in the given
genome compartment. When all the sequences of the
individual strains studied were subjected to a discrimination analysis, we obtained good separation of K3.22
and a group of strains related to RtTA1 (Figure 7B) that
formed the outermost branch in the phylogenic tree.
The remaining strains were randomly mixed with each
other but apparently separated from K3.22 and TA1related strains, which suggested no differences in codon
usage within the main group.

Mazur et al. BMC Microbiology 2011, 11:123

The CAI analyses of the evaluated sequences confirmed good adaptation of chromosomal and chromidlike genes (high CAI values) to host genomes and lower
CAI values for ‘other plasmids’ genes. The CAI values
also reflect the level of transcriptional and translational
activity of particular genes [29]. While the activity of
most of the chromosomal and chromid-like genes could
be considered at least to some extent constitutive, the
‘other plasmids’ and especially symbiosis-related genes
are expressed only transiently in the symbiotic stage
[42]. Therefore, in the Rhizobium model, the differences
in codon usage in translation reflect the balance
between the selection pressure and random mutations
in the functionally differentiated genome compartments.
The differences in codon usage and CAI values between
the genome compartments are most likely a consequence of differential gene expression and adaptability
to optimal codon usage in host genomes [42].

Conclusion
Our study showed that, even within a small rhizobial
population of clover nodule isolates, substantial divergence
of genome organization can be detected especially taking
into account the content of extrachromosomal DNA.
Despite the high variability with regard to the number and
size of plasmids among the studied strains, conservation of
the location as well as the dynamic distribution of the individual genes (especially replication genes) of a particular
genome compartment was demonstrated. The sequence
divergence of particular genes may be affected by their
location in the given genome compartment. The ‘other
plasmid’ genes are less adapted to the host genome than
the chromosome and chromid-like genes.
