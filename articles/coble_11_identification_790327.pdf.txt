The identification of the Romanovs: Can we
(finally) put the controversies to rest?
Michael D Coble1,2

Abstract
For much of the 20th century the fate of the last Imperial family of Russia, the Romanovs, was a mystery after their
execution in 1918. In the mid 1970s the mass grave of the Romanov family (minus two of the children) was
discovered and officially exhumed after the fall of the Soviet Union. Forensic DNA testing of the remains in the
early 1990s was used to identify the family. Despite the overwhelming evidence for establishing the identity of the
Romanov family, a small but vocal number of scientists have tried to raise doubt about the DNA testing during the
late 1990s and early 2000s. With the discovery of the two missing Romanov children in 2007, there was an
opportunity to re-analyze all of the evidence associated with the case which confirmed the initial DNA testing and
brought finality to the mystery. This article will discuss the controversies associated with the Romanov
identification and reflect upon the importance of the case to the field of forensic DNA typing over the last 20
years.
In the summer of 2007, three amateur Russian archeologists discovered 44 bone fragments and teeth near the
Old Koptyaki Road in Ekaterinburg, Russia (Figures 1
and 2). The discovery was approximately 70 m from the
site where the remains of Tsar Nicholas II were discovered about 30 years earlier (Figure 3). I was the Chief of
the Research Section at the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory (AFDIL) at the time and was on vacation when the reports from Russia hit the news. I
thought it would be unlikely that AFDIL would be
involved in the testing, given the large number of
ancient DNA laboratories capable of testing the remains
now compared to the few laboratories available in the
early 1990s, when the first set of remains was recovered.
About one month or so later, LTC (Dr) Lou Finelli
(the laboratory’s director) called me in the office to discuss the possibility that AFDIL would be invited in the
testing of the remains. Peter Sarandinaki of the Scientific Expedition to Account for the Romanov Children (S.
E.A.R.C.H.) Foundation (http://www.searchfoundationinc.org/) had spent years of his life to find the missing
Romanov children, and he was able to convince the

Russian authorities that AFDIL should be involved in
the testing [1].
The eventual fall of Tsar Nicholas II (Figure 4) and
the growth of Soviet Communism changed the course
of history. I propose that the identification of the Romanov remains was also a defining moment for forensic
DNA testing, almost as critical as the first application of
“DNA fingerprinting” using restriction fragment length
polymorphism technology [2,3] to identify Colin Pitchfork’s DNA [4]. The identification of the Romanovs was
an important breakthrough in the development and
acceptance of forensic autosomal short tandem repeat
(STR) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) testing for
highly compromised skeletal remains.
Despite the overwhelming evidence for establishing
the identity of the Romanov family, a small but vocal
number of scientists have tried to raise doubt about the
DNA testing. This doubt perhaps played a role in the
Russian Orthodox Church’s refusal to accept the identification of the remains in 1998 [5]. With the discovery
of the two missing Romanov children in 2007 and the
subsequent retesting of the original material, we can
now reflect on the forensic DNA controversies surrounding the identification of the Romanovs and gain
an appreciation of how much the field of forensic DNA
typing has evolved during the past 20 years.

DNA testing of the first grave
In the mid-1970s, Dr Alexander Avdonin (Figure 5) discovered the mass grave containing the imperial family
and their loyal staff, with the exception of two of the
children: Alexei and Maria. With this discovery, the
secret of the disappearance of the Romanovs was no
longer a mystery [6]. However, it was not until the fall
of the Soviet Union in 1991 that Avdonin and his friend,
filmmaker Geli Ryabov, came forward to reveal their
secret to the rest of the world. DNA testing of the
remains was commissioned by Russian authorities, to be
conducted by Russian geneticist Dr Pavel Ivanov and
one of the world’s preeminent forensic scientists, Dr

Peter Gill, at the Forensic Science Service (FSS) in the
United Kingdom [6]. Dr Erica Hagelberg from the University of Cambridge was also invited to replicate the
findings of Gill and Ivanov [7].
The approach to the DNA testing by Gill et al. [7] was
twofold, using autosomal STRs and mtDNA sequencing
of the two hypervariable regions (HVI and HVII). STR
testing was used as a sorting tool to distinguish each
skeleton and show the putative familial relationships
among the remains. At the time of the DNA testing,
autosomal STR markers were in their infancy. The FSS

utilized a set of five well-characterized autosomal STRs:
vWA, TH01, F13A1, FES/FPS and ACTBP2 (SE33). The
first four of these markers were used to create the
“quadruplex,” one of the first multiplex STR assay kits
[8]. Each marker was amplified in singleplex assays for
the nine femora recovered in Ekaterinburg (Tsar Nicholas, Tsarina Alexandra Fyodorovna, three of their daughters and four of their servants).
The successful amplification of the remains with the
singleplex loci, rather than a megaplex of 16 markers
utilized today, was an early preview to the utility of
mini-STRs. With the exception of SE33, the loci analyzed by Gill et al. [7] had an allele range of approximately 130 to 240 base pairs, making the markers useful
for typing degraded DNA. All markers were successfully
genotyped, with the exception of SE33 for two of the
remains (the servants). It would be several years later
before the community would “rediscover” the utility of
smaller polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons for
challenged samples. It is also worth noting that Gill et
al. [7] used increased sensitivity techniques (for example, increased PCR amplification cycles) to generate the
STR genotypes of each individual. This was necessary to
generate results from these challenged samples. The
STR profiles were used to sort, sex and show familial
relationships among the Romanov family members.
Having established the family unit with STR testing,
mtDNA testing was used next to link the tsar and tsarina to living maternal relatives. Forensic mtDNA testing,
like autosomal STRs, was also in its infancy in the early
1990s. The comparison of the tsarina’s haplotype to her
distant cousin, HRH Prince Philip, was an exact match
in HVI and HVII.
For the tsar, the mtDNA testing was not as easy and
straightforward. In the femur of the tsar, Gill et al. [7]

Page 3 of 7

discovered the presence of a C/T point heteroplasmy at
position 16,169. In the mid-1980s, mtDNA heteroplasmy
was believed to be extremely rare or nonexistent [9] and
was therefore a “controversial” observation, necessitating
further investigations in which cloning was used to confirm the presence of two different DNA strands. Data
from family studies of patients with Leber’s hereditary
optic neuropathy conducted in the late 1980s and early
1990s [10,11] suggested mtDNA heteroplasmy to be
more common. Bendall et al. [12] found that, among
twins, point heteroplasmy was indeed widespread and
proposed that the lack of detection in previous studies
was likely due to the limitation of detecting low-level
variants using sequencing chemistry of the day.
The maternal references for Nicholas, Princess Xenia
Cheremeteff Sfiri and the Duke of Fife were homoplasmic at position 16,169 for the T nucleotide base. Realizing that this “apparently rare” condition of heteroplasmy
in the tsar would create consternation among scientists
and nonscientists alike, Pavel Ivanov had a discussion
with Dr Victor Weedn, then director of AFDIL, during
the International Symposium on Human Identification
(the “Promega” meeting) to conduct additional testing at
AFDIL the following year (P Ivanov and V Weedn, personal communication).
The Russian authorities exhumed the remains of
Nicholas’s brother, Georgii, for additional mtDNA testing. Ivanov et al. [13] gave clear and convincing evidence that the 16,169 heteroplasmy found in the tsar
was in fact authentic, since Georgii had the same point
heteroplasmy, although at a ratio different from that of
the tsar. We now have the luxury of a growing body of
knowledge about mtDNA heteroplasmy. A PubMed
search of “human mtDNA heteroplasmy” returned over
630 articles published over the past 23 years. We now
know that heteroplasmy is not a “rare condition” but
easily identified if the detection method is sensitive
enough [14]. The Romanov heteroplasmy has become
the textbook example of mtDNA heteroplasmy [15-17].
In addition to the skeletal elements tested by Gill et al.
[7], an antemortem piece of evidence from Nicholas II
was tested. As a young man in 1891, Nicholas was sent
on a global tour by his father, Tsar Alexander III. While
in Otsu, Japan, Nicholas was attacked with a saber by a
would-be assassin. Nicholas suffered two blows to the
right side of his head, above the ear, before the assassin
was subdued. A handkerchief used to stop the bleeding
was preserved and eventually held in a Japanese museum.
Ivanov attempted to develop a clean DNA profile from a
piece of the material during his 1995 visit to AFDIL. Ivanov hoped to develop a profile from the material to
match with the results from the skeletal remains. However, he had no success obtaining a profile from this
material (P Ivanov, personal communication).

The controversies ensue
With the completion of the scientific investigations, the
identification of the Romanovs was concluded. Although
two sets of skeletal remains belonging to Alexei and one
of his sisters were missing from the mass grave, the forensic results were very conclusive in identifying the
Romanov family and their servants. Unfortunately, this
was not the end of the story. Before the ink was barely
dry on the two reports identifying the last Russian
imperial family, the “doubters” were ready to deliver
their response. A very thorough review of the efforts to
discredit the forensic DNA testing, including an understanding of the political furor during this time period
(which I will avoid here) can be found in an article by
Nelipa and Azar [18,19] (also available at http://www.
oocities.org/mushkah/Nagai.html).
The Nagai investigations
The first challenge to the Romanov results came from
a Japanese scientist, Tatsuo Nagai, in 1997. Using the
handkerchief museum artifact from the failed assassination of Nicholas in Japan, Nagai declared that he
was able to develop a profile from the cloth and that
this profile did not match the results of Gill et al. [7].
This work was never peer-reviewed or published
[18,19]; however, it gave ammunition to the “doubters”
that the remains found in Ekaterinburg were in fact
counterfeits. In 2008, two different Russian laboratories
performed DNA testing on the shirt that Nicholas
wore during that attack [1,20]. A full profile of Nicholas’s autosomal DNA and Y-STR haplotype matched
the postmortem profile developed from the skeletal
remains.
In 1999, a collaborative effort of Nagai and a Russian
scientist, Dr Vyacheslav Popov, again tried to disprove
the Romanov testing by examining hair samples that
were purported to be from Georgii Romanov. Nagai and
colleagues obtained and sequenced 25 hair samples
from Georgii and compared the data to the mtDNA
sequence established by Gill et al. [7]. The Japanese
researchers determined that, on the basis of the
sequence data generated, there was no match to the
Nicholas mtDNA sequence, especially at position
16,169, where they found only the revised Cambridge
Reference Sequence (rCRS [21]) variant with no hint of
heteroplasmy. This paper was published [22], albeit in a
Japanese-language journal, Igaku to Seibutsugaku.
Although I have no knowledge of or ability to translate
Japanese, I was kindly given a portion of the publication
translated into English by Mr Junichi Hayashi at the
request of Margarita Nelipa and Helen Azar for their
report [18,19]. I also obtained a copy of the paper from
the US National Library of Medicine (Bethesda, MD,
USA).

The relevant sequence information from the Nagai et
al. [22] data requires no understanding of Japanese to
decipher and is summarized in Table 1. It is clear that
the hair sample they sequenced was contaminated.
Seven nucleotide positions have a mixture of two bases:
16,093 T/C, 16,278 C/T, 16,298 T/C, 16,325 T/C,
16,327 C/T, 16,356 T/C and 16,362 T/C. The only
reported “difference” listed in the HVII region is 320C,
which matches the rCRS. Nagai et al. [22] erroneously
reported that Ivanov et al. [13] had observed a transition
at nucleotide position 320 (C-T). The translation of the
conclusions from the study is summarized as follows:
(1) We observed no heteroplasmy at 16,169, (2) we
found seven different heteroplasmic positions in the hair
from Georgii Romanov, and (3) therefore, doubt exists
regarding the authenticity of the remains recovered
from Ekaterinburg.
A closer examination of the sequencing results generated by the Nagai investigation is interesting. By using
the HaploGrep algorithm [23], an online program that
determines mtDNA haplogroups based on the mtDNA
phylogeny from PhyloTree [24], one finds that five of
the eight SNPs (16,223 C-T, 16,298 T/C, 16,325 T/C,
16,327 C/T and 16,356 T/C) are associated with the
Asian haplogroup (Hg) C1a (Table 1). The remaining
three “heteroplasmic” SNPs (16,093 T/C, 16,278 C/T

and 16,362 T/C) are potential private mutations associated with the C1a individual or DNA templates
sequenced from other contaminants. It is especially confounding that no differences in HVII were reported in
the Nagai et al. study [22]. This includes the lack of the
ubiquitous 263A-G and 315.1C differences from the
rCRS. Given the apparent contamination of an HgC1a
individual in the hair samples, one would also expect to
observe differences at nucleotide positions 93, 249 (deletion) and 290/291 (double-deletion) in HVII (Table 1).
Most experienced forensic researchers would categorize the results of Nagai et al. [22] as inconclusive
because of contamination, and they would draw no conclusions from the results. Melton et al. [25] synthesized
data from nearly five years of casework hair samples and
found that aged hairs showed a decrease in their ability
to generate a full profile and an increased chance of
researchers’ observing mixtures. Nagai et al. [22] offered
no explanation for the high number of apparent “heteroplasmies” in the hair of Georgii Romanov [18,19,22].
Their only conclusion was that the remains recovered in
Ekaterinburg were not those of Tsar Nicholas II. It is
unfortunate that individuals (to this day) offer this as
evidence to refute the work of Gill et al. [7] and Ivanov
et al. [13].
On 17 July 1998, 80 years to the day after the Romanov family’s execution, the skeletal remains recovered in
Ekaterinburg were interred at the Peter and Paul Fortress in St Petersburg. On the basis of the uncertainty of
the DNA results, the Russian Orthodox Church has not
recognized the remains as those of the Romanov family.

The Knight investigation
The second challenge to the scientific evidence of the
Romanov remains came from the laboratory of Dr Alec
Knight at Stanford University. The Knight et al. study
was peer-reviewed and published in the journal Annals
of Human Biology [26]. The crux of the criticism in the
Knight study was the initial Romanov testing and the
nested PCR method that the Gill team used to amplify
the mtDNA. Gill et al. [7 used a nested PCR method in
which the entire control region was first amplified with
30 PCR cycles. An aliquot of this PCR product was then
amplified in a second round of amplification that targeted shorter amplicons within the control region.
The Knight group argued that the amplification of
such a relatively large fragment (approximately 1,200
bp) from a degraded sample, such as the samples from
the Ekaterinburg mass grave, was not possible and that
the results obtained by Gill et al. were most likely contamination from modern DNA. The Knight group
obtained a finger bone purported to be from Empress
Alexandra Fyodorovna’s sister Elisabeth (also known as
“Ella”). Ella was married to Nicholas’s Uncle Sergei,

Page 5 of 7

who was assassinated in 1905. Following the death of
her husband, Ella devoted the rest of her life to the
Russian Orthodox Church by becoming a nun in 1909
to help the poor of Moscow. She, along with several
other Romanov relatives, was executed by the Bolsheviks the day after the execution of Nicholas’s family in
1918 [27]. Her body was recovered by villagers near
Alapaevsk and was sent to a Russian Orthodox Church
in Jerusalem.
Using the bone sample from Ella, the researchers
argued that they were unable to amplify three large
DNA fragments (437, 466 and 1,179 bp) but were able
to successfully amplify two short DNA fragments (108
and 128 bp) from this sample. This “lack of replication”
for the larger DNA fragments, the Knight team argued,
was evidence that the Gill team had not amplified the
endogenous DNA of the Ekaterinburg remains. Since
the modern-day reference sample used by Gill et al. [7]
(HRH Prince Philip) did not match their sequence from
Ella, Knight et al. [26] concluded that the initial DNA
testing of the Romanov remains was wrong.
Like Nagai and Popov, Knight et al. [26] found a mixture in the mtDNA sequence data. Rather than declare
an inconclusive result based on the data, the Knight
group conducted additional cloning experiments to
separate the mixed mtDNA fragments. The study determined that the “consensus” mtDNA haplotypes from
their molecular cloning experiments were the authentic
sequence of Ella [26]. The “consensus of the clones”
approach would not be an appropriate method by which
to determine an authentic sequence, especially in a forensic investigation. If a forensic sample is contaminated,
it is impossible to know a priori if the “major” component is endogenous DNA or exogenous contamination.
A rebuttal of the conclusions of the Knight investigation
was published in the journal Science [28,29]. Knight et
al. [30] responded with many of the same arguments
previously enumerated [31].

Concluding thoughts
Both Gill et al. [7] and Ivanov et al. [13] evaluated the
evidence in their investigations using a Bayesian
approach to evaluate the weight of the evidence under
two opposing hypotheses (likelihood ratio): (1) These
are the remains of the Romanovs, and (2) these are not
the remains of the Romanovs.
The statistical analysis of the data was anchored on a
verified control sample which was not controversial:
HRH Prince Philip is a distant maternal cousin of the
Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna. Nagai and Knight did
not evaluate their results within this framework. Instead,
each investigator evaluated the proposition that the hair
was from Georgii and the bone was from Ella, without
consideration of an alternative hypothesis that the hair

Coble Investigative Genetics 2011, 2:20
http://www.investigativegenetics.com/content/2/1/20

and bone were from an unknown individual. In fact,
Knight et al. [26] speculated that if their sample truly
matched the sequence of HRH Prince Philip and was
simply not detected among their clones because of
degradation, then Gill’s results were likely contaminated
by a person who (amazingly) just so happened to be in
the same maternal lineage as HRH Prince Philip!
During our work on the identification of Alexei and
his sister (exactly which sister could be a debate worth
considering for another day), we had two scientists from
the forensic laboratory in Ekaterinburg to observe and
assist us in the testing of the remains. Our diligent
translator, Alexy Zacarin, was there with us every day to
bridge the language divide. Alexy, a very spiritual man,
once told me that he believed the ground had to hold
the remains of the Romanovs until the time came for
the Russian people to accept what had happened and
for the science to identify the bodies. Perhaps in hindsight it was fortunate that the remains of the two missing children were found 30 years after the mass grave
was discovered by Alexander Avdonin in 1977. Technical advances in forensic DNA typing have finally
brought closure to the identification of the entire Romanov family.
It is has taken nearly 20 years to test, retest, replicate
and confirm the Romanov remains with mtDNA, autosomal STRs and Y-STRs. Our field has grown and
matured since the original DNA testing of the Romanov
remains. The Gill et al. investigation [7] was the first
forensic case to show the utility of mtDNA testing of
old degraded material. It laid the foundations of the
quality assurance methodology: ultraclean rooms, typing
analysts and replication of results. It was also the first
example of low-template DNA testing with STRs using
enhanced cycle numbers. The initial work from 1993 to
1996 [7,13] was a watershed moment for DNA testing,
and despite the feeble attempts to discredit these studies
with contaminated data, the results have withstood the
test of time throughout scientific advances.
It is now time to put this controversy to rest.
