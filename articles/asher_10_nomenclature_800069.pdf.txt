Nomenclature and placental mammal phylogeny
Robert J Asher1*, Kristofer M Helgen2

Abstract
An issue arising from recent progress in establishing the placental mammal Tree of Life concerns the nomenclature
of high-level clades. Fortunately, there are now several well-supported clades among extant mammals that require
unambiguous, stable names. Although the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature does not apply above
the Linnean rank of family, and while consensus on the adoption of competing systems of nomenclature does not
yet exist, there is a clear, historical basis upon which to arbitrate among competing names for high-level mammalian clades. Here, we recommend application of the principles of priority and stability, as laid down by G.G. Simpson in 1945, to discriminate among proposed names for high-level taxa. We apply these principles to specific cases
among placental mammals with broad relevance for taxonomy, and close with particular emphasis on the
Afrotherian family Tenrecidae. We conclude that no matter how reconstructions of the Tree of Life change in years
to come, systematists should apply new names reluctantly, deferring to those already published and maximizing
consistency with existing nomenclature.
Background
The last decade has witnessed an unprecedented increase
in the stability of the mammalian Tree of Life [e.g.,
[1-4]]. Although not all clades are fully resolved, and our
understanding of many extinct radiations remains poor,
several previously intractable issues surrounding the living radiations have now been settled [see review in [5]].
A consequence of this newfound stability is the need to
establish names for several high-level clades. In current
practice, the attribution of scientific names to groups of
organisms relies on common descent as the underlying
biological principle. When a previously unrecognized
pattern of descent is discovered, it deserves to be epitomized by a coherent and legal taxonomic name. Ideally,
such a name should be familiar to its users, related etymologically to the group in question, not easily confused
with other names, and grammatically correct. Taxonomic
convention at or below the Linnean Family is regulated
by the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature
(or ICZN) [6], which provides a legal recourse for resolving the many ambiguous and controversial cases that
occur in zoological nomenclature [7]. This code arbitrates among the competing demands of the scientific
community and, ideally, maximizes coherence in animal
nomenclature.

At the family level and below, Linnean categories
require types (genera for families, species for genera,
specimens for species). Hypotheses regarding phylogenetic dispersion around the type form the anchor points
from which synonymies can spring. Because the ICZN
does not apply to units of the Linnean hierarchy above
the family, high-level nomenclature does not have at its
core the type concept. This is a fundamental difference
between low- and high-level taxonomy. Not only are
high-level taxa not associated with type grounding, but
they are also freed from requirements of diagnosis/
description, a requirement at least in the vaguest sense
for establishment/availability of lower-level names. In
practice, it is a hypothesis of common ancestry that
forms the basis of a high level name, and considerable
judgment must be exercised, in addition to phylogenetic
scrutiny, to decide how much this hypothesis can be
modified before the name is sufficiently compromised to
demand synonymy.
For the high-level clades within Mammalia, the best
set of guiding principles for high-level taxonomy are the
introductory pages of Simpson [8], reflected also in
McKenna and Bell [9]. Since the early 1990s, several
investigators have to varying degrees proposed a departure from the ICZN and its Linnean basis in the form of
the “Phylocode” [10], which would entail a system of
official arbitration for high-level categories. Indeed, one
of the principles of the Phylocode is the formal

recognition that Linnean ranks are arbitrary. However,
one need not abandon the Linnean system, or even
depart substantially from historical practice, to incorporate this recognition into nomenclature [11-15]. Like the
ICZN, Phylocode also emphasizes priority in recognizing
taxon names (cf. article 12 of [10]). Following Simpson
(pp. 27-28 in [8]), “article 25 of the [ICZN, now article
23 in the 1999 edition] is the famous Law of Priority,
which is the basic principle and the storm center of
technical nomenclature.... While fully agreeing that the
[ICZN] badly needs revision ... I have attempted to follow their letter exactly in [my 1945] classification of
mammals. Where the letter is ambiguous, I have taken
the spirit to be that choice should promote stability and
perpetuate common usage as far as possible.” Hence,
Simpson viewed “stability and common usage” as the
other major criteria to adjudicate among competing
names. While Simpson regarded priority as a fundamental principle, stability is also of major importance, as
demonstrated by the fact that the ICZN regularly issues
rulings overturning priority to maintain stability (published in the Bulletin of Zoological Nomenclature).
A plethora of new names have been applied to highlevel mammalian clades in recent years (summarized in
Fig. 1 and Tables 1 and 2). In some cases, these names
have not been applied with regard to the taxonomic
conventions outlined by Simpson [8]. Dispute about
nomenclature is unfortunate, but given the context of
an increasingly stable phylogenetic tree for living Mammalia, there are worse problems in biology than relatively minor disagreements about what to call the large
number of now widely-recognized, high-level placental
mammalian clades. Nevertheless, some of this new
nomenclature can be very confusing. Arbitration among
these names is ongoing and, it seems, popularity will
play a larger role than reliance on Simpson [8] or similar efforts based on principle.
Here, we suggest how an application of Simpson’s guidelines can help discriminate among competing names for
high-level groups of placental mammals. In a nutshell,
priority and stability should comprise the overriding principles by which new, high-level taxa are named. Established
names for any given clade should not be altered unless the
name with precedent unambiguously threatens stability.
We suggest that the most appropriate will be those that are
1) the first, published name for a monophyletic group with
unique content and 2) based on terms deemed familiar and
logical to as many students as possible. Failure of a given
taxon to meet one of these criteria does not necessarily
mean it is invalid, but failure in both should.
Names for a resolved tree

Arnason et al. [16] suggested several names for mammalian taxa using etymological and orthographic criteria.

Page 2 of 9

For example, in their view the unusual term Whippomorpha Waddell et al. 1999 [17] for the hippo-whale clade
should be replaced by Cetancodonta Arnason et al. 2000
[18], based on potential confusion with hippomorph perissodactyls. In addition, they argued that Laurasiatheria
Waddell et al. 1999 [17] and Afrotheria Stanhope et al.
1998 [19] should be replaced by Laurasiaplacentalia
Arnason et al. 2008 [16] and Afroplacentalia Arnason
et al. 2008 [16], as the “placentalia” endings more accurately reflect the status of these clades as crown placental
mammals [20]. Arnason et al. [16] are admirably reluctant to accept prefixes of high-level taxa that have only
been partly modified by recent systematic work. For
example, as originally defined [21], Archonta differs from
its modern incarnation in the position of chiropterans
and macroscelidids. As used by McKenna [22], Archonta
excluded macroscelidids and was even closer to the modern version, which groups primates, dermopterans, and
scandentians together. Other researchers [1] have dubbed
this modified version of Gregory’s clade Euarchonta, and
correspondingly use Euarchontoglires for the next more
basal node that joins archontans with lagomorphs and
rodents. A legitimate interpretation of Simpson [8] (see
in particular his point #30, p. 33) would be consistent
with the avoidance of such prefixes in cases where the
content of a clade has not drastically changed. Some may
argue that the current modifications to Gregory’s Archonta are in fact drastic, but the no-less-drastic recognition that birds fall within Mesozoic Dinosauria has not
led to the novel taxa “Eudinosauria” or “Avesdinosauria”
[23], nor has the incorporation of pinnipeds into Carnivora resulted in a change to the latter term [24]. Hence,
this would support retaining Archonta over “Euarchonta”, Lipotyphla over “Eulipotyphla”, and Artiodactyla
over “Cetartiodactyla”.
Balancing priority and stability

While Arnason et al. [16] have identified etymological
and grammatical points in support of their mammalian
taxonomy, they are frequently inconsistent
with Simpson’s [8] emphasis on priority. As summarized
above, there is substantial precedent for favoring priority
over other concerns. For example, Florentino Ameghino
[25,26] was convinced that his native Argentina was the
origin of certain clades of mammals, such as equids and
primates. As South America’s most prolific paleontologist, this conviction expressed itself in many of the
names he published. We continue to accept and use
names such as Notohippus Ameghino 1901 [25] and
Archaeopithecus Ameghino 1897 [26] for endemic South
American ungulates, even though they have relatively
little to do with equids and anthropoid primates (respectively), because of the importance of article 23 of the
ICZN, which values priority over other factors.

in Table 1; names for some competing hypotheses not shown here [e.g.,[29,30,78]] are given in Table 2.

In the same way that we are compelled to accept
Ameghino’s references to primates and equids among
names for unrelated, endemic South American mammals, supraordinal taxa similarly deserve recognition
based in the first instance on priority, even if this
involves questionable orthography and/or etymology.
Hence, genuinely novel clades should be known by their
earliest published names. For mammals, this includes
Laurasiatheria, Boreoeutheria, Afrotheria, Atlantogenata,
Scrotifera, and Euarchontoglires (Fig. 1), assuming the
phylogenetic basis for these taxa remains stable (cf.
Table 2). Even though some may find orthographic and/
or etymological reasons to regret the choice of one or
more of these names, alternatives (e.g., Notoplacentalia

Arnason et al. 2008 [16] or Xenafrotheria Asher 2005
[49]) should be discarded, or at best retained as stem
designations, in favor of their senior synonyms (e.g.,
Atlantogenata Waddell et al. 1999 [17]).
Several mammalian clades have a long history among
taxonomists, and have been recognized as such in most
recent studies. These include Paenungulata, Glires,
Archonta, and most individual orders within Mammalia
[23]. More problematic are names that have been overlooked in recent publications, such as Eparctocyona
McKenna 1975 [22], Uranotheria McKenna and Bell
1997 [9], Tenrecoidea McDowell 1958 [27], and
Zalambdodonta Gill 1883 [28]. The remainder of this
paper summarizes the case for placental mammal

Author attributions are based on the first use of the clade with its current, or near-current, meaning. For example, Butler [77] used “Tenrecomorpha” but did not
include chrysochlorids. In contrast, Arnason et al. [78] used this term to indicate the tenrec-golden mole clade as it is currently-understood and are therefore
cited as the authors for that term as a junior synonym of the name with precedence, Tenrecoidea McDowell 1958 [27]. Some additional clades apparent in
recent studies [e.g., [29,30]], but not reflected in the summary topology of Fig. 1, are listed in Table 2. Note that several names identified as crown-level
synonyms (e.g., Uranotheria, Eparctocyona) remain potentially useful as stem counterparts to the accepted crown taxa.

nomenclature based on the phylogenetic tree depicted in
Fig. 1 (see also Table 1), derived from [2-4]. While this
tree is relatively stable [5], we acknowledge that debate
continues at certain nodes [29,30], and list some alternative terms in Table 2. Such potential for topological
change underscores the need to publish synonymies that
detail previous meanings of high-level names (Tables 1
and 2), essential to understand their usage through time
and to clarify their past and current applications.
Euarchontoglires

As discussed above, Archonta is preferable to “Euarchonta” [23]. However, dropping the “eu” in that term
would not affect the name Euarchontoglires, which was
erected for a genuinely novel concept and has no precedent in the systematic literature. Waddell et al. [31] proposed the name Supraprimates for this assemblage in an
article published on 17 December 2001 (as confirmed
by the Genome Informatics editorial office), a few days
after Euarchontoglires was published on 14 December
2001 by Murphy et al. [1]. The latter name therefore

has precedence, at least for its intended crown constituents. Sundatheria Olson et al. 2005 [32] as a designation
for Scandentia-Dermoptera similarly has precedence
over Paraprimates Springer et al. 2007 [33]. Both may
be rendered superfluous if the competing hypothesis of
Dermoptera-Primates (Primatomorpha Beard 1993 [34]),
supported by analyses of genomic indels [30], proves
robust in future analyses.
Laurasiatheria

Archibald [23] made the point that Ferungulata of
Simpson [8], including terrestrial artiodactyls, perissodactyls, carnivorans, paenungulates, as well as extinct
“condylarths” and South American ungulates (but not
pholidotans or cetaceans), would be preferable to Fereuungulata Waddell et al. 1999 [17]. However, because
the concepts of Simpson vs. Waddell differ substantially
in content, particularly regarding paenungulates and
cetaceans, this is arguably a case where interpretation of
Simpson’s points 24, 29, and 30 ([8], pp. 32-33) justify a
change in taxon name, should the underlying phylogeny

of Waddell et al. [17] prove correct. “Ferungulata” was
also used by Montgelard et al. [35], but like Simpson
they also included sirenians and proboscideans in this
clade, and excluded the counterintuitive but well-supported position of chiropterans among laurasiatheres
near northern, ungulate-grade mammals [3].
Arguably, therefore, Waddell’s concept would be preferable here too. Favoring Euungulata Waddell et al.
1999 [17] over Ungulata McKenna 1975 [22] is based
on the similar fact that the latter concept differs from
current phylogenies by including both tubulidentates
and paenungulates among “ungulates”. Hence, Ferungulata Simpson 1945 [8], Ungulata McKenna 1975 [22],
and Ferungulata Montgelard et al. 1997 [35] represent
substantially different concepts of common descent than
those currently supported by recent mammalian phylogenies (e.g., Fig. 1), and therefore may be replaced with
new names [17] based on Simpson’s criteria outlined
above.
Cetaceans and artiodactyls

The first published name for the hippo-whale clade was
Whippomorpha Waddell et al. 1999 [17]. By the early
1990s, the intra-artiodactyl affinity of Cetacea had been
suggested [36], with some publications correctly identifying Hippopotamidae as the cetacean sister group
[37,38]. Montgelard et al. [35] figured the hippo-whale
branch with the label “Cetacea + Ancodonta”, but in
our view this falls short of creating an explicit nomen
for hippo-whale. Arnason et al. [18] pointed out the
potential confusion of “Whippo-” with Hippomorpha, a
clade consisting of equid perissodactyls and their fossil
relatives. While this is a legitimate concern, by itself it is
insufficient to overturn the clear priority of Waddell’s
term. This case is a high-level, taxonomic analogy with
the retention of Ameghino’s confusing names for genera
of South American notoungulates. Hence, a fair

Page 5 of 9

application of Simpson [8] to this issue, with his emphasis on priority, means that Whippomorpha Waddell et
al. 1999 [17] should be the accepted name for the
whale-hippo crown clade.
The name for the larger assemblage of terrestrial
artiodactyls plus Cetacea nested within it is slightly
more problematic. As previously stated, stability would
be served by retaining the name Artiodactyla over its
frequently used alternative, “Cetartiodactyla”, despite the
addition of cetaceans. While addition of the “cet” prefix
has become very popular in the mammalian systematics
literature, Artiodactyla as a published ordinal designation is still widespread, with over 15000 hits on google
scholar from 2000-2009, vs. 482 for “Cetartiodactyla”.
The advantages of formalizing the new and very well
supported systematic position of whales in its high-level
taxonomic designation are considerable. Furthermore,
given the fact that in some morphological aspects (dentition, body size) whales are more varied than even-toed
ungulates classically arranged within Artiodactyla, a
name change may be warranted under Simpson’s criterion for “reasonable emendation” ([8] p. 33, point 30A).
However, such considerations do not change the fact
that including whales within Artiodactyla is analogous
to cases mentioned above (e.g., Dinosauria including
birds) in which the content of the clade in question has
not drastically changed and high-level names have not
been altered. Therefore, we suggest it would be most
consistent to retain Artiodactyla (including cetaceans) as
a taxon rather than changing the ordinal name for this
group, the even-toed, terrestrial constituents of which
remain intact [23,24].
Eparctocyona was used by McKenna [22] and
McKenna and Bell [9] to denote not only cetaceans
and artiodactyls, but also assemblages of so-called
“condylarths”, including mesonychids, arctocyonids,
and other extinct groups with controversial affinities to
living orders. Based on priority, the name Eparctocyona would trump other, recent candidates for the
whale-even-toed ungulate assemblage, such as Cetartiodactyla Montgelard et al. 1997 [35], and has been
used in a few publications [9,22,39,40]. Indeed, as a
stem clade designation, including for example one or
more extinct “condylarths” as sister taxa to Artiodactyla, it may yet prove appropriate. However, as a
crown designation it is still a junior synonym of Artiodactyla, and it entails the controversial implication that
multiple, poorly understood fossil assemblages ("condylarths” such as hyopsodontids, phenacodontids, arctocyonids, et al.) comprise artiodactyl relatives to the
exclusion of other mammals.
Paenungulata

Uranotheria [9] differs from Paenungulata of Simpson
[8] in that it excludes several extinct groups, such as

Asher and Helgen BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:102
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/10/102

pyrotheres, pantodonts, and dinoceratans. However, in
terms of its living constituents, the two clades are the
same: proboscideans, sirenians, and hyracoids. Taxonomic stability is positively served by not changing a
taxon name with every alteration of its contents (cf.
Archonta excluding bats, Dinosauria including birds).
Hence, the exclusion of some fossil clades from Simpson’s Paenungulata does not justify the wholesale replacement of that nomen, particularly given its priority.
Although a few authors have followed McKenna and
Bell [9] in using Uranotheria [41], and this designation
may still be useful to denote a stem clade, retaining Paenungulata to signify Proboscidea-Sirenia-Hyracoidea better serves the spirit of taxonomic practice outlined by
Simpson [8]).
Tenrecids and chrysochlorids

Both Zalambdodonta Gill 1883 [28] and Tenrecoidea
McDowell 1958 [27] have been used to signify a tenrecid-chrysochlorid clade, although Gill included the Caribbean Solenodon in his formulation. Zalambdodont also
has an anatomical meaning, indicating a single, upper
“V"-shaped molar loph that occludes with lower molars
that lack a complete talonid basin [42]. In addition to
tenrecids, chrysochlorids, and Solenodon, dental zalambdodonts also include some metatherians and extinct
groups such as apternodontids [43]. As used
by McDowell [27] and Frost et al. [44], Tenrecoidea
includes only tenrecids and chrysochlorids; but the root
has frequently appeared over the last century with various suffixes and biological meanings appended to it
[45], a fact which has led some investigators [46-48] to
use the term “Tenrecomorpha” instead. The seminal
paper of Stanhope et al. [19], in which Afrotheria was
first named, included the taxon “Afrosoricida” for the
tenrec-chrysochlorid clade with no justification for why
their novel term should replace one that had the same
content, or why their major discovery that African
insectivorans comprised an entirely different mammalian
radiation, apart from holarctic insectivorans such as soricids, should nevertheless be given almost the same
name. Possibly Stanhope et al. [19] were simply unaware
of McDowell’s Tenrecoidea, not unlike the first author’s
(RJA) neglect [49] of Atlantogenata Waddell et al. 1999
[17] for the Xenarthra-Afrotheria clade, which has priority over Xenafrotheria Asher 2005 [49] as a crown
designation.
In any event, “Afrosoricida” is a name with misleading taxonomic implications, implying a family group
association with Afrosorex, a subgenus (now synonymized) of Crocidura [50,51]. Furthermore, a number of
biologists have already recognized Tenrecoidea sensu
McDowell [23,44,52-55]. Based on priority alone,
Zalambdodonta Gill 1883 [28] might also be regarded
as a contender; however, this term is even less familiar

Page 6 of 9

to contemporary zoologists and has never been used
for just tenrec-golden mole. Arguments in favor of
“Afrosoricida” have been made by authors [56-58] who
regard the historical baggage and implied Linnean rank
of Tenrecoidea as sufficient to reject it in favor of the
more recent term “Afrosoricida”. Indeed, as of this
writing “Afrosoricida” generates more hits on googlescholar (214) than either Tenrecoidea (141) or Zalambdodonta (34). Further in its favor is the fact that
“Afrosoricida” does not imply close relations with nonafrotherian taxa such as apternodontids and Solenodon.
As mentioned above, it replaces these with a confusing
allusion to modern soricids. For new students, the
potential confusion of “tenrecoid” with Solenodon and
apternodontids would seem substantially more remote
than that of “afrosoricid” with soricids, such as
Afrosorex.
To make matters more complicated, a few authors
[59,60] use “Tenrecoidea” with the same meaning as the
Tenrecidae of most other mammalogists [58]. That is,
they elevate Malagasy tenrecs to “Tenrecidae” and African potamogalines to “Potamogalidae” and refer to both
as “Tenrecoidea”. This practice has precedent because
older uses of the family-level name Tenrecidae did not
include potamogalines [8,61], and it is a positive step
insofar as it recognizes the monophyly of the extant
Malagasy forms to the exclusion of mainland potamogalines [62-64]. However, elevation of tenrecs and golden
moles to Linnean ranks above the family is based on the
now obsolete notion that the two groups are unrelated
[65]. Furthermore, the recognition of Malagasy tenrec
monophyly could just as easily have been done by
denoting taxa at levels below the Linnean family, preserving both the now-common understanding of the
term Tenrecidae [9,51,62-64,66] and the precedent of
McDowell’s [27] Tenrecoidea as a designation for tenrecid-chrysochlorid.
Such a proposal for nomenclature within the extant
Afroinsectivora is shown in Fig. 2. Here, Malagasy tenrecs are formally recognized in the Tenrecinae and
mainland African tenrecs in the Potamogalinae. Spiny
tenrecs are grouped in the Tenrecini, Geogale in the
Geogalini, and other soft tenrecs in the Oryzorictini,
with Limnogale recognized as a synonym of Microgale
[62]. To date, the largest analysis of sequence data for
living tenrecs [64] supports the placement of Geogale as
sister taxon to Microgale (including Limnogale) and Oryzorictes. The possibility that one or more African fossils
are more closely related to Geogale than to other tenrecs
[63] justifies placement of the Miocene, African Parageogale with Geogale in the Geogalini. Further suprageneric groupings could be similarly be made within
tenrecins and oryzorictins (e.g., Tenrecina for Tenrec
and Hemicentetes). This arrangement better recognizes

concept is also made”, i.e., the content of a given taxon
changes substantially, he condones reattributed authorship ([8], p. 32). It is therefore reasonable to interpret
Simpson [8] in favor of the view that rank and homogeneity of taxon suffixes are less important than priority
and stability for arbitrating among names.
For these reasons, i.e., the same ones that compel use
of Ameghino’s generic or Waddell’s supraordinal names
(due to priority), Gregory’s Archonta or Owen’s Dinosauria (despite changes within each taxon), we regard
Afrosoricida Stanhope et al. 1998 [19] as a junior synonym of Tenrecoidea McDowell 1958 [27].

phylogeny of [62-64].

common use (cf. Tenrecidae of [66]) and priority (cf.
Tenrecoidea McDowell 1958 [27]) than the alternative
taxonomy [59,60] in which higher, rather than lower,
ranks are used to recognize Malagasy tenrec monophyly.
Furthermore, such a taxonomy for tenrecs is consistent
with the analogous case of the tribe Hominini now used
for Australopithecus, Paranthropus and other habitually
bipedal primates, formerly referred to as “hominids”,
which are more closely related to Homo than to Pan or
Gorilla [67].
Linnean rank and priority

Linnean ranks were important to Simpson [8], although
he recognized that they are without intrinsic biological
meaning. Simpson regarded it convenient to reserve
some taxonomic endings for certain levels of the hierarchy not for any intrinsic meaning of ranks, but only
because this practice maximizes stability, particularly the
suffix “idae” at the familial rank. Importantly, although
Bronner and Jenkins [58] regard the “oidea” of Tenrecoidea as a major criterion for rejecting its use to
designate the (arbitrary) ordinal status of the chrysochlorid-tenrecid clade, Simpson did not regard “oidea”
as exclusively a superfamilial ending and used it at least
once as an ordinal suffix (Hyracoidea). Nor would Simpson have regarded early use of Tenrecidae (including his
own [45]) as prohibiting subsequent alterations of rank
or content, reflecting article 23.3.1 of the ICZN [6],
which notes that “priority of the name of a nominal
taxon is not affected by elevation or reduction in rank”.
Simpson ([8], p. 32) agreed with retaining taxon authorship for a name used at a different level of the Linnean
hierarchy, and recognized that rank-reshuffling is not
necessarily an act of creativity deserving of a reattributed citation. However, when “a basic change in group

Conclusions
Systematists now have an unprecedented understanding
of how clades of mammals are interrelated. Arguments
about nomenclature are a side-effect of this positive
state of affairs, a welcome change from the days, not so
long ago, when decades of study did not lead to broad
consensus on the affinities of certain high-level clades
[68,69]. We hope the cases discussed above will help to
illuminate the standards by which systematists should
provide names to novel high-level clades. Not all readers
will agree with our recommendations, in which decisions have been made about the degree to which a an
existing phylogenetic concept must change in order to
justify a corresponding change in name. In some
instances (e.g., replacing Ferungulata Simpson 1945 with
Fereuungulata Waddell et al. 1999), we argue that a new
name is justified; in others (e.g., replacing Tenrecoidea
McDowell 1958 with Afrosoricida Stanhope et al. 1998)
we argue that it is not. Regardless of disagreements over
individual cases, we hope that our larger point is broadly
accepted, i.e., that new names should be coined with
great reluctance, relying whenever possible on existing
terms, following Simpson’s emphases on priority and
stability. Our expectation is that an ever improving
understanding of the molecular, phenotypic, and paleontological diversity of mammals will result in the discovery of yet more such clades, which will require more
names. Our hope is that the nomenclature applied to
this increased diversity will be principled, rather than
populist.
