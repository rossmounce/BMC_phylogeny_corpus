Abstract
A total of 318 Escherichia coli isolates obtained from different food-producing animals affected with colibacillosis
between 2001 and 2006 were subjected to phylogenetic analysis: 72 bovine isolates, 89 poultry isolates and 157
porcine isolates. Overall, the phylogenetic group A was predominant in isolates from cattle (36/72, 50%) and pigs
(101/157, 64.3%) whereas groups A (44/89, 49.4%) and D (40/89, 44.9%) were predominant in isolates from poultry.
In addition, group B2 was not found among diseased food-producing animals except for a poultry isolate. Thus,
the phylogenetic group distribution of E. coli from diseased animals was different by animal species. Among the
318 isolates, cefazolin resistance (minimum inhibitory concentrations: ≥32 μg/ml) was found in six bovine isolates,
29 poultry isolates and three porcine isolates. Of them, 11 isolates (nine from poultry and two from cattle)
produced extended spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL). The two bovine isolates produced blaCTX-M-2, while the nine
poultry isolates produced blaCTX-M-25 (4), blaSHV-2 (3), blaCTX-M-15 (1) and blaCTX-M-2 (1). Thus, our results showed that
several types of ESBL were identified and three types of b-lactamase (SHV-2, CTX-M-25 and CTX-M-15) were
observed for the first time in E. coli from diseased animals in Japan.

Findings
Pathogenic Escherichia coli is the causative agent of colibacillosis that brings severe clinical sighs such as diarrhea, meningitis and sepsis in domestic animals. E. coli
can be divided into four phylogenetic groups using multiplex PCR method [1]. Several authors have analyzed
the distribution of the main phylogenetic groups among
E. coli strains isolated from human and animals. Extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli usually belongs to groups
B2 and D, while the commensal strains are groups A
and B1 in humans [2]. In healthy food-producing animals, a predominant distribution of group B1 was
reported in E. coli from cattle, while group A was predominantly prevalent in pigs and chickens [3-5]. On the
contrary, although predominant phylogenetic groups

were reported in E. coli from diseased poultry [6-8], little information regarding to diseased cattle and pigs was
available.
Antimicrobial agents have been widely used for treatment of colibacillosis in domestic animals. Antimicrobial
resistance is more frequently found in E. coli isolates
from diseased animals than apparently healthy animals
[9]. Increases in cephalosporin-resistant E. coli in
domestic animals have been a significant worldwide
concern including Japan. Extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL)-producing isolates of E. coli were identified
in domestic animals around 2000 in Japan [10,11]. The
third and greater generation cephalosporin antibiotics
are clinically important antimicrobial agents in human
and animal medicines. Such agents are approved to treat
bacterial diseases in cattle and pigs and not licensed for
enhancing animal growth in Japan. However, cephalosporin-resistant E. coli has been identified in isolates
from not only cattle and pigs but also poultry in Japan

[10,12]. At present the reason for the prevalence of
cephalosporin-resistant E. coli in poultry is unclear.
In the present study, we determined the distribution
of phylogenetic groups in E. coli from food-producing
animals affected with colibacillosis in Japan. In addition,
we examined the characteristics of cephalosporin-resistant isolates of E. coli from the diseased animals.
A total of 318 E. coli isolates from different animals
affected with colibacillosis between 2001 and 2006
throughout Japan were used in this study: 72 bovine isolates, 89 poultry isolates and 157 porcine isolates in 23,
20 and 28 prefectures, respectively, located from north
to south Japan. All the strains were stored in 10%
skimmed milk at -80°C until use. The phylogenetic
grouping was performed by multiplex PCR as described
by Clermont et al. [1].
The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of cefazolin (CEZ) was determined by an agar dilution method
in accordance with the guidelines of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) [13,14]. The MIC of
some of the isolates to CEZ was previously determined
[15]. Susceptibilities of CEZ-resistant isolates to several
b-lactamase antibiotics, cefpodoxime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem and meropenem were
tested according to the CLSI guideline [13,14] using the
commercially available broth microdilution test (Eiken
Co. LTD, Tokyo, Japan). E. coli ATCC 25922 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 were used as quality
controls for MIC determination. The Chi-square test
was performed on the antimicrobial susceptibility and
the phylogenetic subgroup data. The resistance rates in
each phylogenetic group were compared with those in
the overall strains tested. For each comparison, a P
value of < 0.05 was considered to denote significant
differences.
A double-disk synergy test for detection of ESBLs was
performed using clavulanate and cefotaxime, ceftazidime,
cefpodoxime, or aztreonam disks (Nissui Pharmaceutical
Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) as previously described [10].
Detection of b-lactamase genes was carried out by PCR
using primers for blaTEM, blaSHV and blaPSE-1 as described
previously [10]. Multiplex PCR was applied to the AmpC
genes, groups ACC, FOX, MOX, CIT and EBC, detection
as previously described [16]. As for samples positive for
CIT group, sequence analysis was performed using the primer pairs for amplification of the full-length gene of
blaCMY-2 [10]. Multiplex PCR was used for blaCTX-M
detection as previously described [17]. Subtypes of CTXM b-lactamases were determined using the primer pairs as
follows: CTX-MF (5’-GACTATTCATGTTGTTGTTATTTC-3’) and CTX-MR (5’-TTACAAACCGTTGGTGACG-3’) for CTX-M-group1 [18]; bla CTX-M-2 F (5’ATGATGACTCAGAGCATTCG-3’) and blaCTX-M-2R (5’TCAGAAACCGTGGGTTACGA-3’) for CTX-M-group2

[10]; CTXM825F (5’-CGCTTTGCCATGTGCAGCACC3’) [19] and CTXM20 (5’-ATAACCGTCGGTGACAATT3’) [17] for CTX-M-group8 and 25/26. Nucleotide
sequences were preformed directly on both strands of
PCR products by using dye terminator chemistry. The
DNA alignments and deduced amino acid sequences were
examined using the BLAST program (National Center for
Biotechnology Information, USA).
The phylogenetic analysis revealed that 318 isolates of
E. coli from diseased animals were classified into four
phylogenetic groups (Table 1). The phylogenetic group
A was commonly predominant in isolates from cattle
(36/72, 50%) and pigs (101/157, 64.3%) whereas groups
A (44/89, 49.4%) and D (40/89, 44.9%) were predominant in isolates from poultry. The B2 group was rarely
found in E. coli from healthy cattle, chickens and pigs in
Brazil [3] as well as Japan. In Korea, group B2 was also
not found in E. coli isolates from food-producing animals [4]. These trends were similar to those of the present study although clinical isolates from foodproducing animals were used here. On the other hand,
in the United States, groups A and D were predominant
(38% and 28%, respectively) in E. coli from diseased
poultry and group B2 was also found in 19% [6]. In European countries, group B2 was often isolated from diseased poultry [7,8]. Thus, the distribution of
phylogenetic groups may be determined not only by the
animal species but also by their health status or geographical region.
Previous studies showed that the phylogenetic group
distribution may be related to antimicrobial resistance
prevalence in human isolates of E. coli [20]. In the present study, 38 (11.9%) isolates exhibited CEZ resistance
(MIC: ≥32 μg/ml) (Table 2). Twenty-six (68.4%) of the
CEZ-resistant isolates belonged to group A. However,
rates of CEZ resistance among the phylogenetic groups,
except for group B2, were in 8.6-14.4%. Thus, no significant difference in the resistance rates between the phylogenetic groups was observed.
Of the 38 resistant isolates, 11 isolates from two cattle
and nine poultry produced ESBLs while the remaining
27 isolates produced AmpC b-lactamase. The two
bovine isolates expressed blaCTX-M-2, while, of the nine
poultry, four expressed bla CTX-M-25 , three expressed
blaSHV-2, one expressed blaCTX-M-15 and one expressed
bla CTX-M-2 . The bla TEM-1 gene, being non-ESBL, was
detected in 12 isolates. This is the first description of
the blaSHV-2, blaCTX-M-15 and blaCTX-M-25 enzymes in E.
coli from food-producing animals in Japan. In human
patients in Japan, E. coli strains carrying blaCTX-M-2 were
predominantly prevalent around 1997 [21], and then the
dominant b-lactamase type has changed to the CTX-M9 group, including bla CTX-M-14 and bla CTX-M-16 , since
2001 [22]. As for food-producing animals, E. coli

carrying blaCTX-M-2 have emerged in apparently healthy
broilers [10] and cattle [11] in 2000 and pigs in 2003
[12]. In 2002, bla CTX-M-18 , identical to amino acid
sequence of bla CTX-M-14 , was identified in cephalosporin-resistant isolates from healthy broilers [10]. On
the other hand, of the remaining 27 AmpC b-lactamase
producing isolates, 13 isolates were PCR positive for
CIT group, being identified blaCMY-2: 10 from poultry,
two from cattle and one from swine (Table 2). There
were no positive signals for group ACC, FOX, MOX
and EBC. The blaCMY-2 gene was found to be prevalent

in a wide range of food-producing animal species in
Japan [10,12], as well as other countries [23].
In the present study, 5 of 8 isolates producing CTX-M
ESBL and all three isolates producing SHV-type ESBL
belonged to group A. However, group B2 is predominant in SHV-type ESBL producing E. coli isolates of
human origin whereas group D is predominant in CTXM enzyme-producing isolates [24]. On the contrary, 7 of
13 isolates producing CMY-2 b-lactamase belonged to
group A. Group B1 was dominant in CMY enzyme-producing E. coli from retail broiler meats [25]. It is likely

that the genotype of E. coli carrying b-lactamase genes
may be different between humans and food-producing
animals.
It is essential to understand the prevalence of resistance to clinically important antimicrobials in bacteria
from food-producing animals. The MICs of six b-lactam
antibiotics are summarized in Table 2. All CEZ-resistant
isolates were susceptible to imipenem and meropenem.
All isolates exhibit cefpodoxime resistance (MIC of
breakpoint: ≥8 μg/ml) except for one porcine isolate in
which b-lactamase expression was not determined. All
isolates expressing CTX-M enzymes exhibit cefotaxime
resistance (MIC of breakpoint: ≥64 μg/ml) with the
exception of one poultry isolate (MIC: 16 μg/ml) harboring blaCTX-M-25. Resistance to ceftazidime was found
in three poultry and one porcine isolate with blaCMY-2,
and one poultry isolate with blaCTX-M-15. Resistance to
aztreonam was found in a single bovine isolate with
blaCTX-M-2. The MICs of antimicrobials tested varied in
isolates with each b-lactamase gene.
In conclusion, our study suggests that the distribution
of phylogenetic groups in E. coli from diseased domestic
animals varies regionally in addition to animal species.
Moreover, ESBL-producing E. coli from the animals
were frequently assigned to a specific group, being different from human ESBL isolates. Further study on
ESBL-producing E. coli from several animal sources
using the PCR-based phylogenetic typing and the other
genotyping methods may clarify the relationship of the
resistant bacteria and/or the resistance determinants
prevalent in the food-chain and the environments.
