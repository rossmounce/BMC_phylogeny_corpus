Abstract
Background: General protein evolution models help determine the baseline expectations for the
evolution of sequences, and they have been extensively useful in sequence analysis and for the
computer simulation of artificial sequence data sets.
Results: We have developed a new method of simulating protein sequence evolution, including
insertion and deletion (indel) events in addition to amino-acid substitutions. The simulation
generates both the simulated sequence family and a true sequence alignment that captures the
evolutionary relationships between amino acids from different sequences. Our statistical model for
indel evolution is based on the empirical indel distribution determined by Qian and Goldstein. We
have parameterized this distribution so that it applies to sequences diverged by varying
evolutionary times and generalized it to provide flexibility in simulation conditions. Our method
uses a Monte-Carlo simulation strategy, and has been implemented in a C++ program named
Simprot.
Conclusion: Simprot will be useful for testing methods of analysis of protein sequence families
particularly alignment methods, phylogenetic tree building, detection of recombination and
horizontal gene transfer, and homology detection, where knowing the true course of sequence
evolution is essential.

Background
Protein evolution has been largely modelled by considering the amino acid substitution process. There have been
few statistical studies of the processes of insertion and
deletion. Thorne et al. (1991) [2] described a theoretical
parametric model that has been used to model the processes of insertion and deletion of single amino acids. The
model has been extended, and others developed, to
include the consideration of longer indels ([3-5]), how-

ever a model based on actual sequences may be more realistic and therefore preferable.
The study Benner, Cohen and Gonnet (1993) [6] is therefore a landmark one. The distribution of indels length was
empirically determined from the alignment of conserved
proteins with less than 100 PAM units of sequence divergence. This limit on the range of divergence was established in order to reduce both the redundancy of indel
events counted, and the numbers of indels that resulted

from independent overlapping events. In that study and
in a more recent update [7], the estimate for the indel
length distribution fit to a Zipfian distribution.
The study of Qian and Goldstein (2001) [1] on the other
hand, derived an empirical distribution for the length of
indels from a database of protein alignments sharing no
more than 25% sequence identity. The distribution in that
case fit a linear combination of 4 exponential functions.
We call this function the Qian-Goldstein distribution and
the Zipfian distributions found by [7] and [6], the Benner
distributions. The Qian-Goldstein distribution is more
applicable to protein sequence comparisons with long
sequence divergence whereas the Benner distributions are
more applicable to sequences of lower divergence. The
Qian-Goldstein distribution was derived for the determination of realistic gap insertion and deletion penalties
that are generally used in alignment algorithms. These affine gap penalties are used to mimic the fact that although
insertions and deletions are rare events, they often involve
more than one amino acid. That observation reflects the
fact that some regions of protein sequence and structure
are able to tolerate sections of insertion or deletion.
The evolutionary processes of mutation and subsequent
natural selection determine the occurrence of substitutions, insertions and deletion. The specifics of the processes are difficult to model accurately since they are
determined by many factors at all context levels (i.e. the
population, the genome, the cell, and particularly the
DNA and protein sequence and structure). However general protein evolution models are useful as they can help
determine the baseline expectations for the evolution of
sequences, and they have been extensively used for the
computer simulation of artificial sequence data sets.
Two freely available programs that generate sets of
sequences by Monte Carlo simulation of evolution are
Seq-Gen [8,9], and Rose [10]. Seq-Gen generates
sequences using a given evolutionary tree, making substitutions according to a specified model. Several models of
amino acid substitution are available, including the popular PAM [11] and JTT models [12]. Additionally, SeqGen allows rates of evolution to vary between sites according to the gamma model developed by Yang [13]. SeqGen only considers substitutions and does not simulate
the processes of insertion and deletion. On the other
hand, the Rose program does simulate insertions and
deletions, along with substitutions, but has the disadvantage of not allowing for different rates of evolution at different sites. The user determines the distribution of indel
length used by Rose software. That distribution is then
fixed and does not depend on evolutionary time (i.e.
branch length in the tree); only the frequency of indels is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/236

determined by the branch length separating the ancestral
and daughter sequences.
The empirically derived distribution of Qian-Goldstein
[1] was obtained using a subset of structural sequence
alignments corresponding to highly diverged sequences in
the database. The distribution as such is limited to models
of proteins corresponding to this set of circumstances.
Although the Qian-Goldstein distribution is fixed with
respect to evolutionary time, it has the property of being
easily parameterized. We generalized the model so that it
applies to proteins with variable sequence divergence and
show that this generalized distribution may be comparable to the Benner distribution [7] at shorter evolutionary
distances. We implemented our generalized Qian-Goldstein distribution in a new program for the simulation of
protein sequences (Simprot). Like earlier programs, Simprot allows for several models of amino acid substitution,
and permits gamma distributed sites rates according to the
Yang [13] model. By incorporating our parameterized
Qian-Goldstein model for indels, the user has flexibility
to modify the distribution and obtain longer/shorter or
more/less frequent insertions and deletions. Simprot is
the first program to simulate protein sequence evolution
with the additional capability of being able to simulate
indels with a variable length distribution. Additionally,
Simprot allows the protein sequence to be segmented
such that the different segments can evolve with distinct
sets of parameters and tree.

Results
Parametrization of the Qian-Goldstein indel length
distribution
The empirically derived Qian-Goldstein distribution [1]
(equation 8 in that paper) is given by

QG(n) = 1.027 × 10−2 e −n / 0.96
+ 3.031 × 10−3 e −n / 3.13
+ 6.141 × 10−4 e −n /14.3
−5 − n / 81.7

+ 2.090 × 10 e

(1)
.

This function describes the frequency of an indel, of any
length n > 0, as a fraction of the average length of the protein sequence. The model accurately describes a data set of
aligned sequences with less than 25% sequence identity.
The total frequency of indels is estimated by ∑n > 0QG(n),
which converges rapidly to 0.0238. This value is close to
the observed frequency of indels (0.030) that was found
by Qian and Goldstein in database they analyzed [1].
As mentioned above, the dataset used to infer Equation 1
was highly diverged, so we may assume it accurately
applies to sequences of large divergence. We will therefore

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/6/236

assume that the Qian-Goldstein applies at an evolutionary distance c, a parameter to which evolutionary time t
will be scaled. This allows us to define QG'(n, t, c) = QG(n)
for n > 0 and t = c.

In the absence of additional empirical data, we must make
some assumptions about the insertion and deletion processes to derive the indel length distribution for all evolutionary time.
1. We assume that the length of indels will increase with
evolutionary time as larger indels are more easily tolerated
and smaller ones overlap. We therefore expect that shorter
indels arise over smaller divergence times and that larger
indels are the result of independent but contiguous
events. We design the distribution such that it is has the
property that the limit as time goes to 0 for the expected
frequency of all indels (>1), is also 0. This assumes that
the instantaneous rate of an indel involves only a single
amino acid, which is unlikely (see for example [14]). The
assumption is only approximatively true even if the mutation process created only single amino acid indels because
multiple mutations may be fixed by natural selection and
genetic drift. The effect on the indel model will be that the
lengths of indels may be underestimated for very low
sequence divergence.
2. We design the distribution such that it is time-reversible. This makes the assumptions that the probability of
insertions is equal to the frequency of deletions and that
these have equal length distributions. Data from DNA
genome level comparisons [15,16] indicate these assumption are not necessarily true, but the effects of this on the
long range evolution in proteins is not clear. The QianGoldstein and Benner distributions assume time reversibility since the direction of events was not known for the
protein sequences they analyzed. Time-reversibility is a

However this only defines the QG' function at one evolutionary time point, t = c. It is necessary to define the
expected distribution of observed indel lengths for all evolutionary times. The Qian-Goldstein distribution
describes the observed length frequency after a large
amount of divergence, but it does not describe the actual
distribution of the expected rate of fixation in the population of insertion and deletion mutations (the rate of indel
occurrence). This is because a single observed indel may
have been the result of several actual events. Even if the
length distribution for indel occurrences were known, a
Markov model for the process of insertion and deletion
would need to be established and used to derive the
expected distribution of observed indels for any given
degree of divergence. Additional empirical data is needed
to derive the expected distribution of observed indel
lengths scaled to other divergence times.

desirable mathematical property that is often used in
sequence analysis programs for alignment and phylogeny.
3. We assume that the observed indel length distribution
keeps its original form as a sum of four exponential terms
at any fixed time point, and not just for time t = c. This is
consistent with the assumption in the original Qian-Goldstein distribution, which fits four exponential terms.

Using a function of this form allows us to scale the exponential in each term separately.

4. There are still many ways to introduce the time parameter t into the function. Our third assumption was then to
chose a simple linear scaling of the exponents of the function with time. We found this scaling to give reasonable
results when we compare the Benner distributions which
were obtained at shorter time scales (see below).

not to maximize the fit of the curve to the data. The striking
fit indicates that our scaling of the QG distribution is appropriate to model indels at lower levels of sequence
divergence.

We call GQG the Generalized Qian-Goldstein distribution. GQG is a scaled version of the QG function that
describes the probability distribution of indels of length n
(conditional on n > 0) at any evolutionary time t and
assuming an evolutionary scale factor c.

In Figure 1 the distribution of indel lengths is shown plotted for varying values of c and t. In figure 2, we compare
the GQG distribution (with parameters c = 3 and PAM 50,
which are very appropriate) with the data from [7] which
was obtained from sequence comparisons of PAM < 100.
The striking fit of the GQG distribution to data of much
lower sequence divergence indicates that our scaling of
the original QG distribution is appropriate.

Once defined in this way, the GQG does not give the frequency of indels (only their length distribution). The rates
for the assumed four independent poisson processes for
the appearance of indels can be combined into a single
instantaneous rate z. The frequency of indels defines p
such that
p = 1 - e-zt/c.

We define the indel frequency rate p as a parameter from

ter c such that p = 0.03 (the observed Qian-Goldstein
frequency).
By introducing parameters in the distribution, we allow a
large amount of flexibility in the generation of indels and
on their lengths. The indel frequency parameter p can
modify the indel frequency and the evolutionary scale factor c parameter can be used to independently modify the
distribution of indel lengths. Larger values of p will yield
more indels and smaller values of will yield fewer indels.
Larger values of c will yield shorter indels and smaller values of c will yield larger indels.
The original impetus for the estimation of the indel distribution was to derive gap insertion (γI) and gap extension
(γE) penalties for use in alignment programs [1]. We used
the formulas from [1] to derive an approximation for the
natural log odds penalties for gaps

Implementation
We have implemented the Generalized Qian-Goldstein
distribution in a program called Simprot to simulate protein sequence evolution. Given a bifurcating phylogenetic
tree, children sequences inherit the sequence of their parent with modification due to mutation events. The
number of mutations expected depends on the length of
evolutionary time that separates the child from the parent
and their type is determined by the chosen models. Substitutions are made according to the user-chosen substitution model. Insertions and deletions are made according
to the GQG model described above. The user determines
the values of the evolutionary scale factor c which controls
the indel length distribution, and the indel frequency rate
p which determines their frequencies. The shape
parameter for the gamma model of [13] distribution of
evolutionary rates is also determined by the user.
The parameters for the models are input via an interface
screen (available through the Web, or by download for
local Windows and Unix/Linux systems). The locally
installed versions allow several input screens such that the
resulting simulated protein sequences will consist of segments each evolving according to its own set of parameters and tree.
The program generates sequences according to the chosen
indel and substitution models and outputs the alignments
of sequences from the terminal branches. When several
protein segments have been selected, the sequences are

appropriately fused into single sequences by matching the
names of the terminal taxons in the input tree files. The
gap opening and gap extension penalties corresponding
to the input parameters and time t = c for each protein segment is an additional output provided by the program for
user reference.
Evolution
Each protein segment is simulated independently. Simprot parses the given tree file into a tree structure to use as
a guide in simulating evolution. It then generates a random amino acid sequence of given length r at the root of
the tree according to the equilibrium frequency of amino
acids in the substitution model. Each amino acid site is
assigned a rate of evolution based on the gamma distribution. The program then recursively generates mutations
on the protein sequence at each of the tree nodes. There
are two types of mutations: insertion/deletion and
substitution. Indels are performed before substitutions at
each tree node.
Number of indels
Simprot assumes a Poisson process for insertion and deletions and thus the expected frequency of indels (of any
length) in a sequence is

p = 1 - e-zt/c,

(7)

where z is the indel probability and t is the branch length
to the daughter sequence which is scaled by the evolutionary scale factor. For each amino acid site, a uniformly distributed random number is picked to check whether it is
lower than the expected frequency. The number of times
this happens over the entire sequence becomes the
number of indels that will be performed.
Indel positions
Indel sites are chosen according to their rate of evolution
as given by the gamma distribution. This means that sites
more likely to substitute will also be more likely to have
an insertion or deletion.
Indel length
To determine the length of an indel after choosing to create one, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the
indel-length probabilities for n > 0 as determined by the
GQG model is evaluated using Eq. 3. A cap on the indel
length is also applied. Indels must be shorter than the
maximum indel length or 5% of the sequence length
(whichever is smaller).
Indel type
Simprot chooses between insertion and deletion with
equal probability. If insertion is chosen, an amino acid
sequence of the indel length is generated (according to the

Page 5 of 7
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Bioinformatics 2005, 6:236

same amino acid frequency distribution that generated
the root sequence) and inserted before the indel position.
If deletion is chosen, the indel length of amino acids are
deleted beginning with the current position. If the length
of the indel is greater than the number of amino acids in
the sequence following the current position, additional
amino acids are deleted towards the start of the sequence.
The probability of amino acids being inserted and deleted
is the same so that the length of the sequences should
remain approximately the same. The sequence is updated
after each indel event and all indels are performed before
substitutions.
Substitutions
Once all indels have been performed at a given node, Simprot performs substitutions of the individual amino acid
according to the evolutionary substitution model. Currently the models implemented are PAM, JTT and PMB.
The substitution probabilities are calculated from the previously calculated eigenvalue decomposition of the probability matrix. This strategy, first used by Felsenstein in the
Phylip package [17] facilitates computation of the substitution probabilities for any branch length. The model
considers the probability of all amino acid substitutions
for a given branch length times the evolutionary rate at the
site (as determined by the gamma model). As the program
traverses the tree, the descendant nodes inherit the mutations generated.
Alignment
A copy of the "true" sequence alignment is also produced
for the generated sequence family. At each node, the locations of insertions and deletions are maintained relative
to the sequence at the parent node. This correspondence
is called the "gapped sequence" because gap characters () are inserted in copies of both the current sequence and
the parent sequence to represent the correspondence.
After the sequence family has been generated, a recursive
traversal rebuilds the true alignment using the gapped
sequences. The procedure makes use of the fact that, for
any node in the tree, the true alignments are known for
the sequences in the left and right subtrees from this node,
and the gapped sequences can be used to align these two
true alignments, producing the true alignment for all
sequences below the root. This procedure requires only a
linear traversal of the tree, and therefore imposes no
significant additional cost of computation. Simprot outputs the aligned sequences from the leaves of the tree in
Fasta and Phylip format. It also creates a file of the set of
unaligned protein sequences. If the protein is segmented,
the files for the segments are merged into the final
alignment.

Conclusion
While the process of amino acid substitution has been
extensively studied and modelled, there has been relatively little study of the insertion-deletion process in protein coding sequences [18]. The model we propose may
not fit all proteins but it has the properties of being based
on an empirically derived distribution, and being flexible
so as to allow a user to test many conditions. We plan to
use additional empirical data of the frequency and distribution of indels in proteins to refine our model in subsequent releases of Simprot. The alignments generated by
Simprot will be useful for testing methods of analysis of
protein sequence families. It will be particularly useful for
the development of new alignment methods, phylogenetic tree building, detection of recombination and horizontal gene transfer, and homology detection, where
knowing the true course of sequence evolution is
essential.
