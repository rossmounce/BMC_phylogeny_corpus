Abstract
Background: The plant miRNAs represent an important class of endogenous small RNAs that
guide cleavage of an mRNA target or repress its translation to control development and adaptation
to stresses. MiRNAs are nuclear-encoded genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II, producing a
primary precursor that is subsequently processed by DCL1 an RNase III Dicer-like protein.
In rice hundreds of miRNAs have been described or predicted, but little is known on their genes
and precursors which are important criteria to distinguish them from siRNAs. Here we develop a
combination of experimental approaches to detect novel miRNAs in rice, identify their precursor
transcripts and genes and predict or validate their mRNA targets.
Results: We produced four cDNA libraries from small RNA fractions extracted from distinct rice
tissues. By in silico analysis we selected 6 potential novel miRNAs, and confirmed that their
expression requires OsDCL1. We predicted their targets and used 5'RACE to validate cleavage for
three of them, targeting a PPR, an SPX domain protein and a GT-like transcription factor
respectively.
In addition, we identified precursor transcripts for the 6 miRNAs expressed in rice, showing that
these precursors can be efficiently processed using a transient expression assay in transfected

Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Most interestingly, we describe two precursors producing tandem
miRNAs, but in distinct arrays. We focus on one of them encoding osa-miR159a.2, a novel miRNA
produced from the same stem-loop structure encoding the conserved osa-miR159a.1. We show
that this dual osa-miR159a.2-osa-miR159a.1 structure is conserved in distant rice species and
maize. Finally we show that the predicted mRNA target of osa-miR159a.2 encoding a GT-like
transcription factor is cleaved in vivo at the expected site.
Conclusion: The combination of approaches developed here identified six novel miRNAs
expressed in rice which can be clearly distinguished from siRNAs. Importantly, we show that two
miRNAs can be produced from a single precursor, either from tandem stem-loops or tandemly
arrayed in a single stem-loop. This suggests that processing of these precursors could be an
important regulatory step to produce one or more functional miRNAs in plants and perhaps
coordinate cleavage of distinct targets in the same plant tissue.

Background
In eukaryotes microRNAs (miRNAs) are single stranded
20–22 nucleotide RNAs that direct silencing of an mRNA
target by an RNA Inducing Silencing Complex (RISC). In
plants most miRNAs have extensive complementarity to
their target mRNA and induce its cleavage or translational
inhibition. Many of the targets encode transcription factors or signalling proteins controlling different steps of
plant development. In addition, miRNAs have also been
identified that respond to nutrient availability or abiotic
stress, suggesting an important role in plant adaptive
responses. Furthermore, by targeting genes encoding proteins of the miRNA machinery, they regulate their own
biogenesis and function [for review see [1]].
MiRNAs are structurally related to the more abundant
short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) but can be clearly distinguished by their biogenesis pathway [2]. In Arabidopsis, it
has been shown that most miRNAs are encoded by independent genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II, producing a primary precursor (pri-miRNA) characterised by a
stem-loop structure containing the miRNA. Genetic analysis has shown that the pri-miRNA is processed by the
RNase III Dicer-like enzyme 1 (DCL1) to liberate miRNA/
miRNA* (the asterisk denotes the sequences coded on the
opposite strand to the miRNA in the stem part of its precursors) duplexes from the stem structure. The miRNAs
are selectively loaded into the RISC whereas the miRNAs*
are subjected to degradation [1,2].
Identification of miRNAs in different plant species has
been based on the cloning of small RNA fractions and/or
the prediction of miRNA genes in genomic sequences
based on sequence similarity [1]. These approaches have
revealed or predicted several hundred miRNA genes in
Arabidopsis, rice and poplar, for which complete genomes
are available. All the plant miRNAs reported are available
in the Sanger miRNA register [3].

At present in rice there are 240 miRNAs distributed in 62
families [4] reported in the Sanger miRBase Register [3].
Among them, only 20 families are conserved in Arabidopsis and poplar, while the others are specific to monocots
or rice. Most conserved miRNAs are encoded by multigene
families producing identical or very similar miRNAs with
a high level of expression. The conserved miRNAs were
selected early in evolution and have important functions
for plant development or adaptation to the environment
[5,6]. The non-conserved miRNAs are usually encoded by
single loci and have low levels of expression. They
appeared more recently in evolution and their function as
canonical miRNAs has not yet been demonstrated [7].
Recently, high-throughput sequencing applied to small
RNAs in Arabidopsis [7,8], rice [9-11] and other plant species [12-14] have greatly increased the number of miRNA
candidates. These data revealed many new “potential”
miRNA gene families in the different species but most of
them were non-conserved phylogenetically. Nevertheless,
in the absence of available DCL1 mutants or any functional test, some of these novel potential miRNAs could
be difficult to distinguish from the abundant siRNAs that
derive from repeated or retroelement sequences or from
complementary antisense RNAs [9,15].
In our laboratory we proposed to identify and characterise
novel miRNAs that control development in rice and
monocots. To this aim, we produced four cDNA libraries
derived from different rice tissues that were sequenced
and analysed in silico to identify potential miRNA genes.
These were then experimentally tested by identification of
their precursor miRNAs transcripts and dependence of
their expression on rice OsDCL1, an Arabidopsis DCL1
homolog in rice which is essential for miRNA biogenesis.
Using these criteria, we have identified six novel miRNAs
expressed in rice. We predict their mRNA targets and, for
three of them, demonstrate cleavage at the predicted target
site in vivo, suggesting their implication in an organellar
function, phosphate homeostasis and regulation of a GTPage 2 of 19

like transcription factor respectively. Finally we provide
two examples of genes producing a single precursor
encoding two miRNAs, indicating that plant miRNA precursors have the potential capacity to encode several miRNAs and perhaps coordinate their expression.

miRNA distribution and validate our cloning procedure
and the quality of our library.
We also cloned three distinct classes of 21 nucleotide
small RNAs derived from predicted stem-loop structures
encoding conserved (canonical) miRNAs. The first category corresponds to osa-miR156h*, osa-miR393b* and
osa-miR396d*. The second corresponds to a novel RNA
that has a 10 nucleotide overlap with osa-miR393 (not
shown), highly similar to the situation reported for the
osa-miR444 family [10,11]. The third case corresponds to
osa-miR159a.2 (Table 1), a novel miRNA derived from
the same precursor encoding osa-miR159a.1 (described in
details below)

Results
Identification of 6 novel rice miRNAs
Four independent cDNA libraries were generated from the
19–30 nucleotide small RNA fractions extracted from
roots, seedlings, panicle and leaves (see methods). About
2500 clones were sequenced from each library, producing
overall 10,000 sequences. The sequences were first
"cleaned" to discard rRNAs, snoRNAs tRNAs and chloroplastic RNA contaminants. The remaining 1495 non
redundant sequences were aligned using BLASTN with
genomic sequences from Oryza sativa ssp. Japonica cv Nipponbare anotated in TIGR version 4 of rice genome annotation and subsequently actualised in the IGSRP built 4
from Rice Annotation Project Database RAP-DB [4]. Only
sequences giving perfect matches to the genome were
retained. These were analysed for potential stem-loop
structures harbouring the miRNA/miRNA* duplex that
could represent the precursor pre-miRNA [1]. Sequences
mapping to highly repeated sequences annotated in RAPDB [4] and the RetroOryza database for rice retroelements
[16] were discarded as they probably represent siRNAs
[9,15]. We also discarded most sequences matching protein-coding genes as they could represent mRNA degradation products. An exception was osa-miR2055 which is
encoded in an ORF but whose expression was found to
depend on OsDCL1 (see below). From this analysis we
obtained 69 putative miRNAs mapping to different gene
loci. Among these, 45 (65%) correspond to conserved
miRNAs previously described in Arabidopsis thaliana and/
or Oryza sativa or are new paralogues of already described
families. Many of them were cloned multiple times in the
different libraries. The most abundant were osa-miR169,
encoded by a large multigene family, which was cloned
117 times and osa-miR168 that we cloned 40 times (result
not shown). This is in agreement with the work that used
454 pyrosequencing to identify small RNAs [11] Altogether our results on the conserved miRNAs is in good
agreement with previous and recent reports on rice

In addition to osa-miR159a.2 we identified five other
novel miRNA candidates that had not been described in
any previous screening (Table 1). The osa-miR1425 and
osa-miR1428e were cloned twice in the seedling and panicle libraries respectively, while the 3 others were cloned
only once. Only osa-miR827a has an homolog in Arabidopsis thaliana, corresponding to ath-miR827, recently
identified by high-throughput sequencing [7,8], but with
a two nucleotide mismatch. The other miRNAs, with the
exception of osa-miR159a.2 which is found in maize (see
below), seem specific to rice. We did not find homologues
in the other monocots but this is not conclusive as complete genomic sequences are not available for the other
monocots.
Altogether we identified six novel miRNA candidates in
rice that we named osa-miR1425 to osa-miR159a.2.
While this manuscript was in preparation, high-throughput sequencing also identified osa-miR1425 but these was
not described further [10,11]. We present here a detailed
analysis for each of the novel miRNA identified.
Expression profile of novel miRNAs
We analysed the expression profiles of the six novel miRNAs by Northern blot analysis in different rice tissues (Figure 1A). A control for loading is shown with a probe
complementary to U6 snRNA. Osa-miR1425, osamiR2055, osa-miR827a and osa-miR159a.2 were detected
in all tissues but with differential accumulation. OsamiR1428e had lowest level of expression and was prefer-

The miRNAs can be distinguished from repeat-associated
siRNAs, which is the most abundant class of small RNAs
in plants, by their dependence on DCL1 activity for their
biogenesis [1]. To confirm that these are bona fide miR-

NAs, we analysed their accumulation in seedlings from
rice osdcl1IR RNAi lines with reduced DCL1 activity [17].
Clearly accumulation of all of them, except for osamiR1874, is drastically reduced in osdcl1 IR plants compared to wild type plants (Figure 1B). Accumulation of
osa-miR1874 could not be checked in the osdcl1IR
mutants because these plants produce small panicles, the

only stage where osa-miR1874 is expressed. Also in the
case of osa-miR1428e this was difficult to assess as this
miRNA is expressed mainly in panicles, with very little
expression in seedlings (Figure 1B). Overall this analysis
confirms that the biogenesis of all our predicted miRNAs,
except perhaps for osa-miR1874 that could not be tested,
depends on OsDCL1 as expected for canonical miRNAs.

amino acid protein with no similarity to any other protein. A stem-loop structure with the miRNA/miRNA* can
be predicted at the 5'end of the cDNA (Figure 2B). It is
highly likely that this long cDNA produced by the Rice
Full length cDNA Consortium [18] corresponds to the primary precursor pri-osa-miR1425.

Identification and characterisation of miRNA precursor
transcripts and genes
Remarkably, little information has been produced on
miRNA precursors in rice although this is essential to
define a miRNA gene and confirm its expression. Therefore, we first searched for miRNA precursors among the
cDNA and EST libraries available in public databases by
alignment of our candidate miRNAs against them.

osa-miR1428e, a tandem miRNA gene precursor
The cloned osa-miR1428e is encoded by a single locus
(Os03g0611100) on chromosome 3 which gives a 1179
nucleotide mRNA (AK102950) with no protein coding
capacity. Remarkably, this mRNA has two osa-miR1428
stem-loops in tandem (Figure 3A). The cloned sequence
corresponds to osa-miR1428e produced from the second
stem-loop and differs by one nucleotide from osamiR1428d (Figures 3B &3C).

osa-miR1425, a canonical miRNA gene structure
Osa-miR1425 is encoded by a single locus
(Os05g0245700) producing a 2393 nucleotide cDNA
(AK101146) (Figure 2A). This cDNA has little coding
capacity with the biggest ORF predicted to encode a 78

In addition to the tandem osa-miR1428e locus, we found
10 other loci encoding osa-miR1428 homologs (Figure
3C) flanked by highly conserved genomic regions including and extending beyond the predicted stem-loop structures (not shown). Remarkably none of the additional

in small cases indicate divergence related to the cloned osa-miR1428e sequence. osa-miR1428e and osa-miR1428d derive from
the same locus. The miR1428.1 to miR1428.7 refer to predicted miRNAs not annotated in Sanger database. The nomenclature
chr3a, chr3b, etc... refer to different loci in the same chromosome. The detailed chromosomal position is given in methods.

osa-miR1428 loci had a tandem osa-miR1428 stem-loop
organisation. The high sequence conservation of these
osa-miR1428 loci suggests that they could be functional.
Recently three of these loci have been found expressed,
encoding osa-miR1428a, osa-miR1428b and osamiR1428c [10,11]. Most of others are located in retroelement-rich regions for which there is no indication of
expression, as no cDNA or EST has been reported from
them. The only exception is osa-miR1428.1 which maps
to an intron of gene Os03g0791800 which gives an
mRNA (AK067703) coding for a conserved ubiquitin-carrier protein. Remarkably, the host intron for osa-

miR1428.1 is 3531 nucleotides which is much larger than
the 150–200 nucleotide average for plant introns [19]. We
do not know whether the intronic osa-miR1428.1 is produced in vivo, as is the case for several intronic miRNAs
[1]. In any case, the cloned osa-miR1428e can be distinguished from all other osa-miR1428 isoforms by one or
two nucleotide differences (Figure 3C), clearly indicating
that it derives by processing from the osa-miR1428 tandem miRNA precursor.
Finally we also identified by BLASTN analysis a nearly
identical tandem osa-miR1428 gene conserved in Oryza

osa-miR1428 tandem miRNA gene is conserved and could
have an important function in rice (not shown).

ing (not shown). This indicates that the second locus on
chromosome 1 is transcribed and could also produce osamiR2055.

osa-miR2055, a complex genomic organisation
The osa-miR2055 sequence maps to two genomic loci
(Figure 4A). The first is in the first exon of gene
Os09g0103400, which gives a 1366 nucleotides cDNA
(AK064377). This cDNA is predicted to encode a 331
amino-acid hypotethical protein with no similarity to any
known protein or protein motif. A predicted stem-loop
encoding osa-miR2055/osa-miR2055* duplex is found in
the ORF region (Figure 4B).

Identification of osa-miR827a and osa-miR1874
intermediate precursors
Osa-miR827a is encoded by a single locus mapping to an
intergenic region on chromosome 2 (see Additional file
1). No cDNA or EST is reported for this genomic region.
Therefore we used circular RT-PCR (cRT-PCR) [20] to
clone a precursor transcript from a total RNA fraction
extracted from rice leaf tissue (Figure 5A). We obtained
several clones, all corresponding to a sequence of 116
nucleotides that folds into a stem-loop structure (Figure
5B). Our observation that rice miRNA precursors are
encoded by large transcripts suggests that the cloned
sequence represents an intermediate precursor corresponding to pre-osa-miR827a. We were nevertheless unable to clone a larger product by cRT-PCR, perhaps due to
rapid processing or to a low level of accumulation of primiRNA produced from this gene.

A nearly identical sequence to the pre-osa-miR2055 stemloop is found duplicated in an intergenic region of chromosome 1, with no predicted gene. Alignment of these
sequences reveals that the pre-osa-miR2055 stem-loop is
part of an inverted duplication in chromosome 1 which is
conserved in Os09g0103400 and the expressed mRNA
(Figure 4A). We used RT-PCR with specific primers to
detect expression of the chromosome 1 pre-osa-miR2055
locus in rice seedlings. This revealed the expected RT-PCR
amplification product which was confirmed by sequenc-

lines (Figure 5C) [21]. Expression in rdr6 IR line plants is
necessary to reduce production of siRNAs from transfected stem-loop regions. We adapted this assay to express
rice pre-miRNA using the pCUbi:Nos expression vector
that drives transgene expression from a maize ubiquitin
promoter which is constitutively expressed both in dicot-

ylodenous and monocotyledonous plants [22]. Thus this
construct could subsequently be used to transient overexpression of the rice miRNA. First we verified that a canonical rice miR164a precursor was expressed in Nicotiana
benthamiana leaves, producing miR164 that could be
detected by Northern blot with a specific probe while no
signal was detected using probes complementary to other
regions of the stem-loop pre-miR164 (data not shown).

genomic region encompassing the cloned pre-osamiR827a sequence could be processed into osa-miR827a
and detected using a probe complementary to osamiR827a. Clearly the result shows that a specific signal of
21 nucleotides is detected in the transfected leaves, which
is absent in leaves transfected with an empty vector (Figure 5C). This confirms that osa-miR827a is produced
from this genomic locus in vivo.
The osa-miR1874 sequence maps to a single locus in an
intergenic region between two distant genes (see Additional file 1). No cDNA or EST has been reported for this
locus. Again we used cRT-PCR to clone the pre-osamiR1874 from RNA fraction extracted from rice mature
panicles. The cloned pre-osa-miR1874 is 150 nucleotides
long and perfectly folds into a predicted stem-loop (Figure
5B). Probably, this represents one of the last steps of
processing from a pri-osa-miR1874 precursor, as for preosa-miR827a. Using the agroinfiltration assay in Nicotiana
benthamiana, we confirmed that the 537 base pair
genomic fragment including the cloned pre-osa-miR1874
is sufficient to produce osa-miR1874 (Figure 5C).
osa-miR159a.2, a single precursor can produce two distinct
miRNAs
The osa-miR159a.2 sequence maps to a single locus in
gene Os01g0506700 encoding the conserved osamiR159a.1. This gene produces a 1653 mRNA
(AK100209), probably corresponding to the primary primiR159a.1. The osa-miR159a.2 is found in the stem-loop
region encoding osa-miR159a.1 but is 21 nucleotides
upstream and it has a totally different sequence (Figure 6A
and 6B).

In rice the conserved osa-miR159a.1 is part of a multigenic family including six members. Alignment shows
that the osa-miR159a.2 sequence has perfect match only
with the osa-miR159a.1 gene hairpin locus and can be
distinguished from all other osa-miR159 genes by two or
three nucleotide differences (not shown). Northern blot
analysis reveals that osa-miR159a.2 has the same pattern
of expression as osa-miR159a.1 and accumulates to a
comparable level (Figure 1A). Indeed the expression level
of osa-miR159a.1 detected by Northern blot is over-evaluated as the anti-sense miR159a.1 probe probably crosshybridises with other members of this family. Finally, as
expected for miRNAs, osa-miR159a.2 accumulation in
rice depends on OsDCL1 (Figure 1B).
Next we confirmed that the stem-loop region including
osa-miR159a.1 could be processed to produce osamiR159a.2 in planta (Figure 6C) using the agro-inoculation assay previously described (Figures 5C). To this aim
Nicotiana benthamiana leaves were transfected with a con-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/123

struct expressing a 446 nucleotide genomic sequence
encompassing the stem-loop encoding both osamiR159a.1 and osa-miR159a.2. Northern blot analysis
with a miR159a.1 complementary probe clearly detected
a stronger signal than that detected in leaves transfected
with an empty vector (Figure 6C). The positive signal
detected for osa-miR159a.1 in control leaves is probably
due to cross-hybridisation of the probe with endogenous
Nicotiana miR159 which is conserved in plants. These
results indicate that rice osa-miR159a.1 is processed from
a stem-loop precursor in the Nicotiana leaves.
The osa-miR159a.2 complementary probe clearly
detected a strong signal of 21 nucleotides in infiltrated
leaves, which is much stronger than the background
detected in leaves transfected with an empty vector (Figure
6C). An additional signal of 24 nucleotides was also
detected with this probe that was not detected using the
osa-miR159a.1 probe (Figure 6C) or when expressing
other pre-miRNAs (Figure 5C). Considering that this 24
nucleotide RNA is normally not detected in rice plants
(Figure 1A) this could suggest that processing of the osamiR159a.1 precursor to produce osa-miR159a.2 is not
accurate in a heterogeneous system or could implicate
another Dicer distinct from DCL1 under our conditions,
in which this stem-loop is overexpressed in Nicotiana
benthamiana leaves.
To further support that osa-miR159a.2 has a functional
importance for rice we searched for osa-miR159a.2-osamiR159a.1 tandem structures conserved in more distant
Oryza species with different genome types [23]. Because
complete genomic sequences for these Oryza species are
not available, we aligned by BLASTN the osa-miR159a.1
precursor with BAC ends sequences from 12 Oryza species
available in OMAP http://www.omap.org. This produced
the homolog sequences for Oryza coarctata with HHKK
genome and a partial sequence for Oryza ridleyi with HHJJ
genome. The additional species, Oryza officinalis with CC
genome, Oryza alta and Oryza grandiglumis both with
CCDD genomes, were amplified by PCR from genomic
DNA using primers designed from conserved sequences in
the osa-miR159a.1 precursor (see methods). These fragments were cloned and sequenced. The results clearly
show that, as for Oryza sativa, that has an AA genome, all
have retained a perfect osa-miR159a.2 sequence just
upstream from the conserved osa-miR159a.1 (Figure 7A)
producing conserved stem-loop structures (Figure 7B).
We looked for osa-miR159a.2 conservation in other
monocots. Although miRNA precursor sequences show
high divergence except for miRNAs and miRNAs* regions,
we found a predicted homolog for osa-miR159a.2 with 2
mismatches in maize located 21 nucleotides upstream
from the predicted maize miR159 (Figure 8A). It is impor-

tant to note that this homology among these two cDNA is
restricted to the region encompassing the two miRNAs.
This is clearly shown by dot plot analysis that shows four
small diagonal fragments at the 5' end of the cDNAs from
both maize and rice (Figure 8B). The maize sequence folds
perfectly into a predicted stem-loop, similar to the rice
osa-miR159a.2-miR159a.1 stem-loop precursors (Figure
8C).
Altogether these results indicate that osa-miR159a.2 is
conserved in all Oryza species and in maize, being produced by processing of the osa-miR159a.2-miR159a.1
tandem precursor.

Target genes
To predict target genes, we carried out a screening considering basic criteria reported for miRNA:mRNA target functional interactions defined in plants as indicated in
methods [24,25].

For osa-miR1425, we found numerous predicted mRNAs
targets, which all encode PPR proteins (Figure 9A). These
are RNA binding proteins characterised by pentatricopeptide motifs and most are addressed to mitochondria or
chloroplast in plants [26]. We confirmed cleavage of one
PPR mRNA target (Os10g0495200) in rice seedlings in
vivo by 5'RACE. In addition, two other PPR predicted tar-

gets of osa-miR1425 were also recently validated by Lu et
al [10]. The other PPR mRNA predicted targets show perfect alignment with these three validated target genes at
the osa-miR1425 recognition sites and are therefore also
potential targets for osa-miR1425 cleavage (Figure 9A).
We note that the five target genes are clustered in a 316
kilobase region on chromosome 10 (Figure 9A). A similar
situation is observed for the target PPR genes predicted on
chromosome 8, in which 3 out of 4 targets are clustered in
a 160 kilobase region (Figure 9A).
The osa-miR827a has two predicted targets encoding two
distinct proteins characterised by an SPX domain. This
domain is associated with proteins that have been impli-

cated in transport or sensing of phosphate or nitrogen in
Arabidopsis [27,28]. We confirmed by 5'RACE cleavage of
the 5'UTR of the mRNA corresponding to the best candidate target encoded by Os04g0573000 (Figure 9B).
The osa-miR159a.2 is predicted to target Os03g0113500
that encodes a GT-2 like transcription factor and
Os10g0516500 which encodes a hypothetical protein
with significant similarity to GT-like transcription factors
(Figure 9C). Both genes are expressed, as revealed by corresponding cDNAs in databanks. We carried out 5'RACE
analysis to test for cleavage of the GT-2 like transcription
factor mRNA in vivo and confirmed it by mapping on the
predicted miRNA complementary site (Figure 9C).

The osa-miR1428e, osa-miR2055 and osa-miR1874 are
predicted to target genes with different functions (see
Additional file 2). These predicted targets are all
expressed, as demonstrated by the existence of corresponding cDNAs or ESTs in databanks. We could not validate cleavage of predicted targets for osa-miR1428e, osamiR2055 and osa-miR1874 by 5'RACE. Indeed, this is a
common observation for most non-conserved miRNAs, as
previously reported by others in Arabidopsis [7] and rice
[10]. This could be due to a very low level of expression of
the targets or the instability of the cleaved product. For
instance the osa-miR1428e target, Os03g0289100, which
encodes a predicted protein kinase (see Additional file 2),

is expressed but its expression level is very low as revealed
by MPSS signatures corresponding to these genes [9]. A
similar situation is observed for osa-miR1874, predicted
to target Os04g0311100 which encodes a protein of
unknown function. Notably MPSS data reveal expression
of this gene mainly in ovaries and mature stigmata [9], in
agreement with the specific expression of osa-miR1874 in
panicles (Figure 1A).

tified 6 novel miRNAs in rice. These 6 novel candidates
were selected after a stringent analysis of many thousands
of sequences paying particular attention to their precursor
RNAs and genomic organisation. Expression of five of
them was shown to be dependent on OsDCL1, while the
expression of osa-miR1874 could not be tested in osdcl1IR
mutants (Figure 1B).
Several remarks can be made on our study compared with
previous work, including two recent reports using highthroughput sequencing to identify rice small RNAs
[10,11]. The first is that our cloning procedure is qualitatively comparable to high throughput sequencing
approaches, as we cloned nearly all abundant miRNA species representing conserved miRNA families previously
described in Arabidopsis, rice or other plant species. The
most abundant species in our libraries were osa-miR169

and miR168 that we cloned 117 and 40 times respectively
(result not shown). This is in agreement with a recent
report using 454 pyrosequencing to identify small RNAs
in rice [11] and differs from MPSS high-throughput
sequencing that identified osa-miR168 as the most abundant miRNA in their libraries [10].
Remarkably osa-miR827a, a rice miRNA homolog to athmiR827, had escaped identification by high-throughput
sequencing in rice [10,11]. A simple hypothesis is that
some conserved miRNAs have low levels of expression
which, coupled to a limiting cloning step cannot be compensated by high-throughput sequencing. Overall this
work suggests that novel miRNAs, even conserved, should
be still identified and expressed in plants under different
biological or environmental conditions. We note that an
osa-miR827 has been predicted that has 3 mismatches

with ath-miR827 [29]. In fact this predicted miRNA maps
in a repeated CACTA transposable element (unpublished
data). Moreover it is predicted to target an mRNA encoding a sec14 cytosolic factor [29] while both osa-miR827a
and ath-miR827 target an mRNA encoding an SPX protein.

cago truncatula [40]. These clusters encode similar isoforms from conserved miRNAs. More recently, five
tandem miRNA precursor were reported in soybean [41].
Here we provide two new examples of miRNAs gene clusters in rice representing two different cases of precursors
encoding tandem miRNAs.

A different situation occurs for the non-conserved miRNAs. A few of them which are abundant are regularly
cloned, such as osa-miR444 or osa-miR820, that we also
cloned. Nevertheless, most of them have a low level of
expression and are rarely cloned in more than one library
[10,11]. This makes it very difficult to distinguish these
non-conserved miRNA from siRNAs that derive from
repeated sequences or perfect hairpin structures found in
retrosequences. Thus, although we found many candidates fulfilling the miRNAs structural criteria, we retained
only those that we could detect by Northern and whose
expression is dependent on OsDCL1. The exception was
osa-miR1874 for which we could not test OsDCL1
dependence because it is only expressed in panicles,
which are extremely reduced in osdcl1 IR panicles. Indeed,
we believe that a definition of novel miRNA genes will
require a deep genomic analysis coupled to identification
of precursor miRNAs as reported here.

The first corresponds to the Os03g0611100 gene which
gives a large precursor encoding tandem copies of osamiR1428e and osa-miR1428d stem-loop structures (Figure 3). We also identified a nearly identical tandem osamiR1428 gene in Oryza sativa sp indica showing that this
tandem miRNA gene has been conserved in other rice subspecies (not shown). Thus the osa-miR1428e/d gene is a
fourth example in flowering plants producing a tandemly
arrayed miRNA precursor but for the first time it concerns
a non-conserved miRNA.

The rice miRNA precursors are large transcripts and can
encode multiple miRNAs
An important contribution of this work is the identification of precursors for each of the rice predicted miRNAs
coupled to a fine analysis on their genomic organisation.
Indeed, studies on plant miRNA precursors are limited
and mainly restricted to a few examples in Arabidopsis
[30,31]. Here we present potential primary precursors for
osa-miR1425, osa-miR1428e, osa-miR2055 and osamiR159a.2 which correspond to long cDNAs reported by
the Rice Full length cDNA Consortium [18]. We did not
find any reported cDNAs or ESTs for osa-miR827a and
osa-miR1874. We believe this is due to low levels of these
miRNAs coupled to the rapid processing of pri-miRNA.
Intermediate pre-miRNA species seems most stable as we
could clone them for osa-miR827a and osa-miR1874 by
circular RT-PCR.

In flowering plants several miRNA gene clusters have been
reported but most correspond to clusters producing independent transcripts encoding a single miRNAs [32-34].
The large precursors encoding plant miRNAs have the
potential to encode multiple miRNAs, either identical or
different. Tandem miRNA precursors are common in animals and Chlamydomonas [35] but are rare in moss [36].
In flowering plants only a few cases of tandem miRNAs
expressed within a common precursor have been
described in detail. These correspond to miR156 and
miR395 in rice and maize [37-39] and miR166 in Medi-

The functional significance for expressing tandem array of
similar miRNAs is not clear, but it has been shown for the
rice/maize miR156 and the Medicago miR166. In the case
of the rice osa-miR156 is encoded by 12 loci, but only one
of them encodes a tandem MIR156b-156c precursor [37].
This tandem array is functionally important as in maize
over-expression of a tandem miR156 gene produces the
Corngrass1 heterochronic mutant [39]. In the case of the
tandem miR166 gene in Medicago truncatula it was shown
that it is important for the control of root architecture
[40].
In the previous examples identical miRNAs were produced from tandem stem-loop structures in a single precursor. The osa-miR159a.2, which is produced from the
same stem-loop encoding osa-miR159a.1, represents a
different case. In contrast to frequent cases of small RNAs
derived from the same precursor encoding the canonical
miRNAs that are usually interpreted as slippage of imperfect DCL1 processing [7-11], osa-miR159a.2 is 21 nucleotides from osa-miR159a.1 and has a complete different
miRNA mature sequence. The existence of a functional
osa-miR159a.2 produced from the osa-miR159a.1 precursor is further strengthened by the perfect phylogenetic
conservation of the osa-miR159a.2-osa-miR159a.1
duplex in distant Oryza species and in maize (Figures 7
and 8). Finally, the transient expression of the osamiR159a.1 stem-loop clearly indicated production of osamiR159a.2 in agro-infiltrated leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana. These observations, coupled to the observation
that its predicted target is cleaved in vivo (Figure 9)
strongly support our hypothesis that osa-miR159a.2 produced from osa-miR159a.1 precursor is a functional
miRNA.
Osa-miR159a.2 should not be a unique case and there
should be other examples in plants of genes encoding two

BMC Plant Biology 2008, 8:123

or more functional miRNAs located in the same stemloop region. A hint of this situation has already been
observed in Arabidopsis and soybean for a few miRNAs
[7,8,41]. Expression of these miRNA tandem arrays could
represent a mechanism to coordinate the production of
various distinct miRNAs to cleave their distinct mRNA targets in the same temporal or developmental stage or tissue. It would be particularly interesting to assess this
hypothesis and elucidate the mechanisms involved in the
regulation and processing of this stem-loop to generate
two miRNAs.
The functional role of the predicted miRNAs
We confirmed cleavage of predicted targets at the miRNA
complementary sites for osa-miR1425, osa-miR827a and
osa-miR159a.2 by 5' RACE.

Notably osa-miR1425, corresponding to recently found
miRNAs by high-throughput sequencing [10,11], is predicted to target at least 12 genes all encoding PPR proteins. We confirmed cleavage of one of the PPR targets,
while cleavage of two other predicted PPR targets was confirmed by others [10]. The PPR are RNA binding proteins
characterised by pentatricopeptide motifs and represent
one of the largest families in plants including 450 genes in
Arabidopsis and 477 in rice [26]. This enormous expansion
of PPR genes is specific to plants, as in other eukaryotes
PPR are encoded by 1 to 6 genes [26]. In plants, most of
them are targeted to mitochondria or chloroplasts and
have been shown to control virtually all steps of organellar gene expression [26]. The three validated targets plus
the 7 other predicted PPR targets of osa-miR1425 (Figure
9A) represent a minor fraction of the 477 rice PPR genes
but these genes are clustered on chromosomes 10 and 8.
This could be reflected by specific events of duplication
unique to this small subset of PPR genes targeted by osamiR1425. In any case osa-miR1425 would be the first
example in eukaryotes of an miRNA controlling organellar biogenesis. It is tantalising to imagine that by altering
osa-miR1425 levels in rice one could identify the RNA targets of the PPR proteins, most of which have as yet
unknown roles [26].
A distinct case is observed for osa-miR827a. This miRNA
is the homolog of recently reported ath-miR827 but differs by two nucleotides [7]. Significantly, both the rice and
Arabidopsis miR827 are predicted to direct cleavage of
mRNAs encoding proteins with an SPX motif. We confirmed cleavage of one of the predicted target at the
miRNA complementary site in the 5'UTR by 5'RACE. It
has also been shown that the predicted SPX target of athmiR827 is cleaved in vivo at the predicted miRNA complementary site [7]. SPX domains are found in proteins associated with nutrient transport. In Arabidopsis they have
been found respectively in proteins encoded by PHO and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/123

NLA genes controlling adaptation to phosphate [27] and
nitrogen [28]. These data strongly suggest a role of osamiR827a and ath-miR827 in the response of rice and Arabidopsis to phosphate or nutrient availability.
We also detected cleavage of osa-miR159a.2, whose predicted target encodes a GT2-like transcription factor. Previously other groups had reported small RNAs produced
from stem-loops encoding canonical miRNAs in Arabidopsis. Nevertheless, no target cleavage could be shown for
any of them and they are probably products of DCL1 slippage during processing of the precursor [7-11]. Therefore,
this is a very important result that strongly supports a
functional role for osa-miR159a.2, produced from the
same stem-loop structure encoding osa-miR159a.1. Interestingly, the second target predicted for osa-miR159a.2 is
also related to GT-like transcription factors, in agreement
with the observation that some miRNAs target transcription factors from the same family [1]. This also supports
the hypothesis that osa-miR159a.2 is a functional miRNA
rather than a by-product of DCL1 slippage. Our results
suggest a possible significance of co-regulation of TCP
and/or MYB genes and GT2-like factors that are targeted
by osa-miR159a.1 and osa-miR159a.2, respectively, in
rice.
For osa-miR1428e, osa-miR2055 and osa-miR1874 we
could not detect any 5'RACE product to confirm cleavage
of the predicted target. The lack of cleavage for predicted
targets for most reported non-conserved miRNAs is a
common observation. This could be due to low levels of
expression of mRNA targets, as is the case for osamiR1428a targets as evaluated by MPSS analysis, or to
instability of the cleaved product. An alternative explanation is that some of these miRNA do not direct cleavage of
the target but rather control its translation, as recently
shown for some plant miRNAs [42] or its expression at
another level, for instance at the transcriptional level or by
controlling alternative splicing, as shown for some miRNAs in animals [43].

Conclusion
Overall, we have provided compelling evidence for 6
novel miRNAs in rice, strongly supported by their dependence on OsDCL1. An important point in this analysis is
the identification of long pri-miRNA precursors coupled
to fine genomic analysis to screen the small RNA
sequences. This analysis, even if restricted to a small
number of novel candidates, reveals great diversity in
miRNA genomic organisation in plants, to which should
be added the intronic miRNAs [44] which have not been
discussed here. Most importantly, we show two distinct
cases of single precursors encoding tandem miRNAs. Our
analysis suggest diverse mode of the regulation of expression of miRNA genes and the processing of their miRNA

precursors that could be important to coordinate with
mRNA target cleavage and on which we know very little in
rice and even in other plants.

Methods
Cloning of endogenous small RNAs from rice
The rice (Oryza sativa) plants used in this study were
japonica cv Nipponbare. Total RNA was extracted separately from young seedlings, roots, a pool of leaves of two,
three and four-week-old plants and a pool of immature,
mature panicles and panicles just after fertilization using
TriReagent in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (Sigma). The small RNA cDNA libraries were generated from 500 to 800 μg of total RNA as described
previously [45]. Briefly, small RNA from 18 to 28 nt were
isolated by acrylamide gel size fractionation, purified and
ligated sequentially to 5' and 3' RNA/DNA adapters
(5'adapter: 5'TGGGAATTCCTCACTrArArA3', 3'adapter:
5'P-rUrUrUCTATCCATGGACTGTidT3'
from
Dharmacon). Reverse transcription and PCR amplification
were performed using adapter oligonucleotides. PCR
products were cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega)
and transformed into competent cells. Colony PCR reactions were performed using pGEM-T Easy vector primers
T7 and M13R and PCR products were sequenced.
Sequence analysis and selection of candidate miRNAs
Automated base calling of raw sequence traces was performed with the PHRED program [46]. An in-house program using the vecscreen option of BLAST was used to
eliminate poor quality sequences and remove the vector
sequence. Sequences with a length between 18 and 25 bp
were retained for the next steps. First, using BLASTN [47],
sequences identical to rRNA, tRNA, chloroplastic or mitochondrial sequences were discarded. Among the remaining sequences, we searched for those corresponding to
members of families already described in the Sanger
miRNA registry [3]. To do that, sequences were considered
as belonging to the same family if the length and/or
sequence polymorphism between all members were less
than 3 nucleotides mismatches. Sequences that were not
identical to a previously described miRNAs and did not
belong to an already known miRNA family were mapped
in silico by BLASTN on the the Rice Annotation Project
DataBase assemblies [4]. Only perfect matches were considered. To identify sequences matching on transposable
elements, each locus was mapped on the Rice Annotation
Project DataBase assemblies [3] and RetrOryza database
[16]. Sequences co-localising with transposable elements
were discarded. We then searched for a potential miRNA*
sequence using WU-BLAST [45] with a maximum distance
of 800 bp and a minimum of 75% of sequence identity
between the miRNA and the miRNA*. The predicted fold
back structures were confirmed using RNA fold program
from Vienna using default parameters [48].

Full length cDNAs corresponding to predicted miRNA
precursors were searched using BLASTN against full length
cDNAs deposited into GenBank. Finally the genomic location of all predicted miRNA candidates were subsequently
revised by matching to the IGSRP 4 from Rice Annotation
Project Database RAP-DB, which is the most comprehensive database on rice genome annotation [4].
Selection of miRNA target candidates
Putative miRNA target sequences were predicted by two
approaches. We first used a BLASTN analysis on RAP-DB
[4] selecting for miRNA/mRNA interactions allowing for 4
G.U wobble and 3 mismatches, excluding those in critical
positions 10 and 11, no more than 2 mismatches between
nucleotides 2 and 12, and no clusters of 2 mismatches on
the 3' end of the miRNAs [24]. In the second approach we
used miRU program [25] against the TIGR rice genome
mRNA dataset (OSA1 release 3).
RNA gel blot analysis
Total RNA was extracted using TriReagent (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions from several organs
of wild type Nipponbare (leaves of young and adult
plants, immature panicles, panicles just after fertilization
and roots of adult plants) and from adult leaves of
osdcl1IR lines [21]. Northern blot hybridisations were performed with 50 μg of total RNA separated in a 15% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a Zeta-Probe GT nylon
membrane [45]. Membranes were cross-linked under UVtrans-illumination and hybridised overnight at 40°C with
32P oligonucleotide probes complementary to the miRNA
sequences. As a loading control, each blot was hybridised
with a 31 nucleotides oligonucleotide labelled probe
complementary to U6 snRNA. Membranes were exposed
to phosphor screen (Amersham Bioscience).
Transient expression assay in Nicotiana benthamiana
leaves
Transient expression of rice stem-loop predicted
sequences in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves [21] was made
using the pC2300 overexpression vector, a derivative of
pCambia2300 carrying Gateway BP cassettes between the
maize Ubiquitine promoter (Ubi) and the Nopaline synthase 3' polyadenylation region [22]. Rice genomic fragments of ~500 bp encompassing the stem-loop predicted
structure carrying the miRNA/miRNA* plus 150 nucleotides of genomic sequences flanking the 5' and 3' region
were amplified by PCR and cloned in pC2300. A fragment
carrying a Miniature Inverted Repeat Transposable Element (MITE) (ORSgTEMT01701966) was used as a negative control. The resulting plasmids were transferred to the
Agrobacterium strain EHA105 by electroporation and prepared for infiltration. Two to four-week-old Nicotiana
benthamiana Rdr6IR leaves were infiltrated [21]. Four days

post-infiltration, total RNA was extracted and subjected to
Northern blot as described previously.
5'RACE analysis
Poly (A) RNAs from total RNA rice leaves were isolated
using mRNA isolation kit (Promega). An RNA adapter was
directly ligated to 100 ng of mRNA using a T4 RNA ligase
(Promega). Ligated mRNA were reverse transcribed using
a Stratascript reverse transcription kit and with random
hexamers according to the manufacturer's instructions
(Stratagene). 5' Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends
(5'RACE) were performed on Os02g36924 and
Os04g48390 transcripts corresponding to candidate
miRNA putative targets. Initial PCR reactions were done
with an adaptor primer and complementary gene specific
primers. The nested PCR were performed on 1 μl of initial
reactions with the same adaptor primer and complementary gene specific internal primers. The resulting PCR
products were gel purified, cloned in pGEMt-easy vector
(Promega) and sequenced.
Circular RT-PCR
This was done as described [20]. Essentially total RNA
from rice panicle were self ligated with T4 RNA ligase 1
(New England Biolabs). Briefly, 10 μg of RNA was incubated overnight at 14°C with 80 u T4 RNA ligase 1 in a
100 μl final volume. Following ligation, RNAs were phenol/chloroform extracted and precipitated with ethanol.
Then miRNA precursors were amplified by RT-PCR with
the gene specific primers:

from the corresponding genomic DNAs, using primers
Forward (5'GGTGGTCATGGACTCATTGG'3) and Reverse
(5'GCAAAGAAGAGCCGAAAGAG '3) Primers. These were
designed based on conserved regions at the 5' and 3'
extremities of hairpin structures identified by alignment
of the six osamiR159 precursor from Oryza sativa ssp
japonica cv Nipponbare. This led us to amplify genomic
sequences from the indicated rice species. All sequences
were confirmed by sequencing.
The maize orthologue sequence to miR159-osamiR159a.2 from rice was identified by BLAST search of
the NCBI maize EST collections (dbEST database) with a
fragment of the osa-miR159a. The sequences showing
highest similarity (E-value ~0) were selected and assembled with cap3 software [49]. Dotter [50] and Muscle [51]
programs were used for sequence comparative analysis of
cDNA sequences from rice and maize.
The structure of the putative maize pre-miR159-osamiR159a.2 was calculated with RNA fold program from
Vienna using default parameters [48].
Locus position and nomenclature
For all our genes we used the RAP DB annotation on
IRGSP4 built 4. The different osa-miR1428 locus, shown
in Figure 3 correspond to:
