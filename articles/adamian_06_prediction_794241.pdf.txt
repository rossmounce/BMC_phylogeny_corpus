Abstract
Background: Membrane proteins compose up to 30% of coding sequences within genomes.
However, their structure determination is lagging behind compared with soluble proteins due to
the experimental difficulties. Therefore, it is important to develop reliable computational methods
to predict structures of membrane proteins.
Results: We present a method for prediction of the TM helix orientation, which is an essential
step in ab initio modeling of membrane proteins. Our method is based on a canonical model of the
heptad repeat originally developed for coiled coils. We identify the helical surface patches that
interface with lipid molecules at an accuracy of about 88% from the sequence information alone,
using an empirical scoring function LIPS (LIPid-facing Surface), which combines lipophilicity and
conservation of residues in the helix. We test and discuss results of prediction of helix-lipid
interfaces on 162 transmembrane helices from 18 polytopic membrane proteins and present
predicted orientations of TM helices in TRPV1 channel. We also apply our method to two
structures of homologous cytochrome b6f complexes and find discrepancy in the assignment of TM
helices from subunits PetG, PetN and PetL. The results of LIPS calculations and analysis of packing
and H-bonding interactions support the helix assignment found in the cytochrome b6f structure
from green alga but not the assignment of TM helices in the cyanobacterium b6f structure.
Conclusion: LIPS calculations can be used for the prediction of helix orientation in ab initio
modeling of polytopic membrane proteins. We also show with the example of two cytochrome b6f
structures that our method can identify questionable helix assignments in membrane proteins. The
LIPS server is available online at http://gila.bioengr.uic.edu/lab/larisa/lips.html.

Background
A significant increase in the number of structures of alpha
helical membrane proteins in recent years revealed a
remarkable complexity of interacting transmembrane
(TM) helices. A great variation in length, shape, and tilt
angles relative to the membrane plane is found in helical
membrane proteins. For example, a structure of protein
transporter (1RH5) contains a helix that is only about one

half the length of the TM region, the structure of ClC chloride channel (1KPL) contains discontinuous helices,
while all aquaporin structures (1FX8, 1J4N, 1RC2) contain two half helices important for function. Some TM
helices are tilted and packed within the helical bundle so
that they are only partially exposed to the membrane.
Membrane proteins with ten or more TM helices may have
helices that are completely buried within the helical bunPage 1 of 17

dle [1]. This great diversity only reflects the conformational space of integral alpha-helical membrane proteins
sampled by the existing 30+ unique structures. If the
number of structures of integral membrane proteins
grows exponentially as predicted [2], even greater complexity in structural elements can be expected for transmembrane domains. This poses a great challenge for
prediction and modeling of polytopic membrane proteins
[3].
Recently, the structures of homo-oligomeric transmembrane (TM) proteins were successfully modeled using the
techniques of simulated annealing, molecular dynamics
[4-7], Monte-Carlo simulations [8], and an empirical scoring function designed to specifically distinguish tightly
packed TM oligomers [9]. Ab initio modeling of structures
of polytopic membrane proteins is more complicated
[10]. Recently, the Rosetta structure prediction method,
which uses a new membrane-specific version of the
Rosetta low-resolution energy function, was successfully
implemented for the prediction of structures of polytopic
membrane proteins [11]. Other methods such as MembStruk [12] and PREDICT [13] start from ideal helices that
are later subjected to "coarse" and "fine" optimization
steps by energy minimization and molecular dynamics
simulations. A required step in these methods is the prediction of TM helix orientation. Typically, a hydrophobic
moment for every TM helix is determined [14] under the
assumption that the hydrophobicity moment should
point in the direction towards the lipid bilayer. However,
Stevens and Arkin [15] showed that hydrophobicity
moment alone is a poor indicator of the lipid-accessible
surface in membrane proteins.
A strategy to improve the accuracy of prediction of helix
orientation is to take advantage of available evolutionary
information. It is well known that solvent-exposed residues in both soluble [16] and membrane [17-19] proteins
are less conserved than buried residues. Komiya et al [20]
proposed a method for characterizing the exposure of αhelices to the membrane that was based on the periodicity
of conserved residues. Taylor et al [10] developed an automatic method that can proceed from a scan of the protein
sequences to a predicted three-dimensional structure. In
this method, finding non-conserved hydrophobic positions in multiple sequence alignments identifies the lipidexposed surfaces of TM helices. The same idea was used to
aid in the building of an alpha-carbon template for the
TM helices of rhodopsin [21]. Briggs et al [22] suggested
the use of widely available evolutionary information to
find variable residues within homologous TM helices that
are not important for the native structure. This information then can be used as constraints for global searching
molecular dynamics simulations. Recently, an automated
method for the analysis and prediction of buried and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/6/13

exposed residues of TM proteins with an impressive prediction accuracy of 80% was developed by Beuming and
Weinstein [23]. This method is based on a new amino
acid surface propensity (SP) scale derived from membrane
protein structures and evolutionary conservation of buried and exposed residues. The probability of finding a residue in the protein interior is calculated for every residue
in the TM helix. A cut-off value of this probability, which
depends on the number of sequences in the multiple
sequence alignment (MSA), is used to predict whether the
residue is at an interior or exterior position.
In this study, we propose and extensively test a new
approach for the prediction of helix-lipid interfaces of TM
helices from sequence information alone based on a
canonical model of the alpha helix. This method features
a collective assessment of conservation and physicochemical properties of the residues forming surface
patches along the TM helix. Each surface patch is centered
on one of the positions of the coiled coil heptad repeat
and can be in contact with lipids or other helices. We score
every patch with a scoring function, LIPS (LIPid-facing
Surface), that combines a lipophilicity scale (TMLIP2)
[24] and conservation entropy scores of residues [25]. We
demonstrate using a set of 162 TM helices with helix-lipid
interfaces that our method achieves an accuracy of 88%.
We also describe how our method can be used to resolve
inconsistency in experimental structures of cytochrome
b6f complex orthologs.

Results
Heptad motif in TM helix-helix interactions
The atomic interactions between two helices can be represented graphically as a two-dimensional atomic contact
map as shown in Figure 1, which records the number
count of the interhelical atomic contacts within the
antiparallel left-handed helical pair formed by helices tm
I and tm II of subunit SdhC of succinate dehydrogenase
from E. coli (1NEK) [26]. We use the heptad motif as a
structural template, where the structurally equivalent
positions occur every two turns of the α-helix. The interacting residues on helices tm I and tm II of subunit SdhC
can be mapped to the heptad repeat positions a, d, e and
g by assigning the optimal starting position for the first
interacting residue, i.e., when the first interacting residue
of tm I (Thr23) is assigned to position e of the heptad
repeat, the rest of the interacting residues can be assigned
to positions d, g, a and e of the heptad repeat. Similarly,
the correct starting point for mapping the interacting residue of tm II to the heptad repeat is position e for the first
interacting residue Met74.

We performed a similar mapping on 850 interacting helical interfaces from 425 TM helical pairs, where we
obtained the best alignments of the interacting residues

Contact map of helix-helix interactions within the
left-handed helical pair formed by helices tm I and
tm II from SdhC subunit of E. coli succinate dehydrogenase (PDB: 1NEK). The three top rows and three left
columns contain information on coiled coil heptad positions
abcdefg (marked as H), residue numbers (N) and residue
types (R) for tm I and tm II, respectively. Residues involved
into interhelical interactions between these two TM helices
are in bold. The number of atomic contacts as determined by
INTERFACE calculations with probe radius of 0.5 Å between
two interacting residues is listed at the intersections of the
respective row and column. For example, Ser33 from tm I
has 4 atomic contacts with Ala80, 3 atomic contacts with
Tyr83, and 8 atomic contacts with His84 from tm II, while
neighboring residue Val32 has no contacts with any residue
from tm I.

from every helical interface to the heptad repeat motif.
Figure 2 summarizes the alignments of interacting residues in helices to the positions of the heptad repeat in 294
parallel (192 right-handed, 102 left-handed) and 546
antiparallel (222 right-handed, 324 left-handed) helical
pairs. We find that the majority of interacting residues can
be accurately mapped to heptad repeats.
Left-handed helical pairs have a higher fraction of interacting residues that can be mapped to canonical positions
a, d, e and g of the heptad repeat (94.7% and 92.4% for
parallel and anti-parallel helices, respectively). For righthanded parallel and antiparallel helical pairs, about
86.9% and 86.5% of interacting residues can be mapped
to heptad repeats, respectively. In the right-handed helical
coiled coils, structurally equivalent positions occur every
three helical turns with the undecad repeat a-k [27,28].
Peters et al [] found that the packing of residues in the
right-handed coiled coils follows the general principle of
knobs-into-holes packing of the left-handed coiled coils,
with residues in the a and h positions of the undecad
repeat structurally corresponding to residues in the a and

us to use a heptad repeat as a simplified model for the
interacting residues in the right-handed helical pairs as
well.
Helical faces
Since ~90% of all interacting residues in TM helices can be
aligned to the heptad repeat positions, it is reasonable to
assume that the residues forming lipid-accessible helical
faces should follow similar patterns, as the degrees of freedom in the lipid-facing residues are constrained by the
residues involved in helix-helix interactions, the majority
of which are adequately characterized by the heptad
motifs.

In the canonical model of the alpha helix [29], every seventh residue along the N- to C-terminus direction occupies a position that is roughly two turns away and
underneath the previous one. The positions of every 7th
residue, "the anchoring residue", would form a slightly
twisted surface along the helix, formed by 2 to 5 residues
depending on the length of the helix. To make the number
of residues in a TM helical face consistent, we add every
third and fourth residues to the interfaces defined by the
anchoring residues. These additional residues occupy
positions one turn away from the anchoring residue. Figure 3A shows in spacefill the Cα atoms that form such a

mostly lipid-exposed helical faces, which should contain
the least conserved but predominantly lipophilic residues,
as well as the mostly buried helical faces, which should
contain the most conserved and less lipophilic residues.

Model of canonical helical faces
Model of canonical helical faces. (A) Cα atoms that form
a helical face are shown in space filling. Residues 3 and 4, 10
and 11 and 17 and 18 complement the anchoring residues 0,
7, 14 and 21, respectively. (B) Helical wheels illustrating the
seven canonical helical faces centered at each of the seven
positions of the heptad repeat. The central helical wheel contains numbers that label the helical faces 0 through 6. These
numbers correspond to heptad positions a through f around
which the helical surfaces are centered. The corresponding
helical face is depicted as an outer wheel located next to that
label. The outer helical wheels depict residues forming each
of the seven helical faces, e.g., face 0 is formed by residues at
heptad positions a-d-e, face 1: b-e-f, face 2: c-f-g, face 3: d-g-a,
face 4: e-a-b, face 5: f-b-c, and face 6: g-c-d.

helical face. Here, the helical face is centered around the
anchoring residues "0", "7", "14", and "21" and complemented with residues "3" and "4", "10" and "11", and
"17" and "18", respectively. Similarly, taking each of the
seven positions of the heptad repeat in turn as the anchor
position, we can build seven different helical faces. In Figure 3B, seven different helical wheels illustrate these seven
faces anchored at each of the seven positions of the heptad
repeat. The nodes of the central helical wheel contain
numbers labeling the helical faces 0 through 6, which correspond to the heptad positions a through f as anchoring
positions. The corresponding helical face is depicted by a
helical wheel, located directly along the direction of the
vector from the origin to the anchoring residue. The outer
helical wheels depict residues forming each of the seven
helical faces, e.g., face 0 is formed by residues at heptad
positions a-d-e, face 1: b-e-f, face 2: c-f-g, face 3: d-g-a, face
4: e-a-b, face 5: f-b-c and face 6: g-c-d.
Prediction of TM helix orientation
The orientation of a TM helix relative to a lipid bilayer can
be predicted by finding either the mostly lipid-exposed or
the mostly buried helical face. We explore both
approaches by comparing prediction results for the

Table 1 summarizes the results of prediction of helix orientation for 162 helices from 18 membrane proteins for
which a sufficient number of homologous sequences is
available to compute positional entropy (see Methods
section). The average lipophilicity of a helical face was calculated using TMLIP2 scale [24], which was recomputed
every time to exclude the protein that was tested. TMLIP2
contains separate scales for the headgroup and hydrophobic regions of phospholipid bilayer to account for the different physico-chemical properties of the membrane.
Table 1 lists the number of correctly predicted lipidexposed and buried faces, based on the percentage of the
lipid-accessible surface area of the residues forming a helical face. We compare prediction results when only the
average helical face lipophilicity L f was used, when only
the average positional entropy E f of a helical face was
used, and when the product of both lipophilicity and
positional entropy (Sf = E f L f ) was used.
All lipid-exposed helical faces were determined correctly
in 8 out of 18 proteins (Table 1). These proteins are relatively small and contain between 5 to 10 TM helices
together with the strong ligand binding sites within the
TM bundle, e.g., bacteriorhodopsin (1C3W) and rhodopsin (1L9H) contain covalently bound retinal, while
succinate dehydrogenase (1NEK) and nitrate reductase A
(1Q16) bind heme molecules. These binding sites provide
strong evolutionary and physico-chemical constraints for
the buried residues, resulting in strong discrimination
between buried and exposed helical faces.
Results in Table 1 show that the prediction of the lipidexposed faces is more reliable than the prediction of the
buried faces. Indeed, we find that the face with the smallest lipophilicity index or the smallest entropy is not
always the most buried: it often represents a tightly
packed helix-helix interface and should not be used for
prediction of helix orientation alone. There are 48 TM helices where prediction of buried faces has failed. We compare the positions of the predicted buried faces for these
helices with the positions of the correct helical faces on
the helical wheel (see Additional File 1). We find that in
most cases the correct faces have significant overlap with
the predicted faces. The anchor residues are shifted only
by one residue on the helical wheel in 28 helices, and by
two residues in 18 helices. For example, predicted buried

lipid-exposed helical face is predicted correctly if the highest scoring face has the largest lipid accessible area.
3 The buried helical face is predicted correctly if the lowest scoring face has the smallest lipid accessible area.
2 The

face on TM4 (D) of bacteriorhodopsin is 6, while the correct face is 3. Helical wheel diagram (Figure 3B) shows
that these two faces overlap by two residues and are neighbors to each other.
The best result (with average of 88% of correct predictions) was obtained for prediction of lipid-exposed helical
faces with a scoring function that combines average
lipophilicity and entropy. Using either lipophilicity or
entropy scorings correctly predicts 55% and 81% of lipidexposed helical faces, respectively. This result demonstrates that evolutionary conservation as measured by
positional entropy provides stronger discrimination than
lipophilicity. Prediction of the mostly buried helical face
was less successful: the combined Sf scoring function produced 70% of correct predictions, while lipophilicity and
entropy scorings produced only 44% and 63% of correct
predictions, respectively.
TM helices may have very complex packing patterns
within a helical bundle. For example, the tm II helices of
SdhC and SdhD hydrophobic membrane anchor subunits
of succinate dehydrogenase (SQR) cross the TM bundle
with a large tilt angle and have lipid-exposed surfaces on
the two opposite sides of the transmembrane domain.

Our method works well for this complicated example. Figure 4 shows residues on the predicted lipid-exposed faces
for all TM helices in SQR. There are two disconnected
faces for both tm II helices from SdhC and SdhD subunits.
The predicted lipid-exposed faces in each case contain two
segments that are found to be lipid-accessible on opposite
sides of the helical bundle.
Prediction of lipid-exposed faces for structure-based and
predicted TM helices
To assess how the definition of the TM helix boundaries
affects the results of prediction of helix orientation, we
compare the results of predicted helix orientations for
structure-based and predicted TM helices in Leu transporter LeuTAa from Aquifex aeolicus (PDB ID: 2A65), a bacdependent
terial
homologue
of
Na+/Cl- –
neurotransmitter transporter. All 12 TM helices are taken
as predicted by the hidden Markov model topology predictor TMHMM [30]. With exception of helix 7, the
sequences of computationally predicted and structurebased TM helices have significant overlap throughout the
whole length of the helix (Table 2). There are two buried
helices, which have most of their surfaces hidden within a
helical bundle. These are not suitable for LIPS calculations, but can be predicted using RANTS scoring method

of lipid accessibility [1]. The results of LIPS predictions of
the lipid-exposed faces for the remaining 10 TM helices
with TMHMM and structure-based sequences are summarized on Table 2. Correct predictions were made for both
structure-based and computationally predicted TM helices
for 5 helices with the N-terminal helix boundary difference ranging from 1 to 7 residues. For helix TM4, LIPS correctly predicted the lipid-exposed face for structure-based
helix and gave the second best choice (with the majority
of the predicted residues being lipid-accessible) for
TMHMM helix. For helix TM9, LIPS correctly predicted the
lipid-exposed face for TMHMM helix and failed for the
structure-based helix. LIPS failed for both sequences of
helix TM5, which differ only by 1 residue at the N-terminus and by 4 residues at the C-terminus. The second best
choice was predicted for both structure-based and computed versions of helix TM12. LIPS correctly predicted
lipid-exposed surface for structure-based TM7. We were
unable to assess the correctness of the LIPS prediction for
computationally predicted TM7 helix because the predicted sequence mainly represented the interhelical loop
region according to 2A65 structure. The results on Table 2
demonstrate that predictions with identical outcome were
obtained for 7 out of 9 helices for which the comparison
between structure-based and computationally predicted
sequences was plausible indicating a significant tolerance

of the LIPS method to the definition of helical boundaries.
Prediction of orientation of TM helices in transient

Members of the protein family of transient receptor

Vanillin receptor TRPV1, which possesses weak voltage

molecular sensor for detecting multiple pain-producing
stimuli. TRPV1 is a key element for inflammatory nociception and an attractive drug target.

Although there are no high-resolution structures of TRP
channels available at the present time, the overall structural organization of TRP channels should be similar to
that of voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels [31], which
are composed of tetramers of subunits containing two
pore-forming helices (S5 and S6) connected by a membrane-re-entrant loop P and the voltage-sensing transmembrane segments S1 to S4. There are several structures
of voltage-dependent channels available, including the Xray structure of a rat brain voltage-dependent Shaker family K+ channel (PDB:2A79) [32]. TRPV1 has no significant
sequence similarity with these sequences, indicating that
it would be difficult to produce a reliable sequence align-

ment to build a homology model. Here, we use LIPS scoring to predict orientation of TM helices in TRPV1 channel.
First, we predict the locations of the six TM helices of
human TRPV1 channel (accession number CAB95729)
using a hidden Markov model topology predictor
TMHMM [30]. We then build a multiple sequence alignment profile for every TM helix and rank helices by their
lipid accessibility using RANTS server [1]. Our ranking by
lipid accessibility shows that TM helices S6 and S5 are the
least lipid accessible, while helix S3 is the most lipidaccessible (Figure 5). This agrees well with the hypothesis
that the transmembrane part of TRPV1 channel should be
similar to that of voltage-gated K+ channels.
Finally, we use multiple sequence alignment profiles for
all TRPV1 TM helices to calculate LIPS scores for helical
faces on every helix. The results of LIPS calculations are
presented on Table 3, which gives information about helical faces with the largest and the smallest LIPS scores on
helices S1–S6, as well as the residues found on the respec-

LIPS calculations by showing the TM region of the tetrameric rat brain K+ channel structure (2A79, Figure 6A),

green lines, respectively (Figure 6B). Figure 6B also shows
that the exposed and buried faces are predicted on the
opposite surfaces for all TM helices with the exception of
helix S4, where the buried and exposed faces overlap,
which may indicate that the prediction for this helix is
incorrect.
Assessment of different structural assignment in
homologous membrane proteins: two cytochrome b6f
structures (1Q90 vs. 1VF5)
The multisubunit cytochrome b6f complex mediates electron transfer between the photosystem II and the photosystem I reaction centers, in which H2O is the electron
donor [33]. Each cytochrome b6f monomer contains eight
subunits and seven natural prosthetic groups. Almost
identical structures of cytochrome b6f complex were
obtained from the thermophilic cyanobacterium Mastigocladus laminosus (PDB: 1VF5) [34] and the green alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (PDB: 1Q90) [35]. Six out of
eight polypeptide chains with TM helices are highly
homologous in both structures, with sequence identity
between the respective orthologous chains of 56.6% for
cytochrome f, 83.7% for cytochrome b6, 78.1% for subu-

3.1 Å for 1VF5 and 1Q90, respectively). We examined the
pattern of packing and conservation of residues in the TM
helices of subunits PetG, PetL and PetN from both structures. Our overall findings suggest that the placement of
the subunits in cyanobacterial structure 1VF5 should follow the same pattern as that of green alga structure 1Q90.
Our analysis is described in more details below and supplemented by multiple sequence alignments for TM helices of subunits PetG, PetL, PetN, and PetM (see Additional
File 2).
Packing of PetN subunit with PetL and PetM subunits
Placement of the PetN TM helix is different in 1Q90 and
1VF5 structures: it is almost completely buried within a
helical bundle in 1Q90 and is exposed in 1VF5 (Figure 7).
Blast searches with the PetN sequences of green alga and
cyanobacterium against a non-redundant database
yielded 31 sequences with pairwise sequence identity
between 29%–88%. LIPS calculations correctly predicted
lipid-accessible face containing residues Ile72, Ile75,
Gly76, Ala79, Val82, Met83, Phe86, Ser89, Leu90, and
Trp93 in the case of 1Q90. Of these residues, only Ile72,
Ile75, and Met83 are accessible to the probe with radius
1.9 Å. These probe-accessible positions are among the

least conserved in the MSA of the PetN subunit in the TM
region as seen on the sequence logo (Figure 8A). The analogous face in 1VF5 also receives a high LIPS score and partially faces phospholipids. However, this surface is not the
most lipid-exposed in the cyanobacterium cytochrome b6f
complex. In fact, the highest lipid accessibility is observed
for two PetN helical faces from 1VF5, which contain
highly (100%) conserved Trp8, Ser18, Val22, and Arg26
(Figure 8B), and have lower LIPS scores. The analogous
faces with conserved residues in the PetN TM helix from
1Q90 are buried within a helical bundle and are mainly
involved in helix-helix interactions with helix I from subunit IV (Figure 8C). Remarkably, there is an interhelical
intersubunit H-bond between highly conserved (100%)
Arg95 (PetN) and Asp35 (subunit IV) in 1Q90 (Figure
8D). However, Arg26 in PetN from cyanobacterium, a
counterpart of Arg 95 in green alga, faces lipids with its
side chain aligned along the TM helix and points into the
middle of phospholipid bilayer (Figure 8B). Such antisnorkeling behavior is not characteristic for the Arg side
chain in this region of the membrane as shown by
Granseth et al [36] and reviewed by Liang et al [37].
Another highly conserved residue in the PetN subunit is
Trp77/Trp8 in 1Q90 and 1VF5, respectively. In the cyano-

bacterium structure (1VF5), Trp8 points towards the lipid
phase (Figure 8B), while in the green alga structure
(1Q90) this residue points inside of TM bundle into the
lipid-filled cavity and forms a H-bond with highly conserved Gln37 from the soluble domain of cytochrome f
(Figure 8C). Both positions of Trp residues are feasible,
although the H-bond with highly conserved Gln37 from
cytochrome f in green alga adds to the support of the helix
packing pattern in 1Q90 structure. Additionally, Trp8 in
1VF5 has a highly unfavorable dihedral phi angle of 132°, with the ideal value being around -65°. Trp77 in
1Q90 has a more favorable phi angle of -54.2° (Dihedral
angle data are obtained from PDB).
The N-terminal end of the PetN TM helix interacts with
the TM helix of PetL subunit in the green alga structure

1Q90, and with PetG subunit in 1VF5. A BLAST search of
the non-redundant database with the PetL sequences from
green alga and cyanobacterium yielded 11 sequences with
pairwise sequence identity between 13% – 87%. LIPS calculation correctly predicted the lipid-accessible and inaccessible faces in 1Q90, while it failed again in 1VF5. The
sequence logo on Figure 9 shows that the PetL subunit has
overall high sequence variability with only one 100% conserved residue (Tyr7 in 1Q90 and Tyr8 in 1VF5). A possible interhelical H-bond between the hydroxyl groups of
Tyr7 and Ser85 in 1Q90 was detected by HBPLUS [38]
(Figure 9). Although position 85 in PetN is rather variable, the sequence logo of the PetN subunit (Figure 8A)
shows that the homologous sequences mainly contain Ser
or Thr residues, both of which can form a H-bond with
hydroxyl group of Tyr.

Residues Ser85 and Ser89 form an SS4 motif (following
the nomenclature of Senes et al [39]) on the PetN TM
helix, and pack tightly against Gly80 and Gly84 (GG4
motif [39]) on the subunit PetM in 1Q90, as shown on
Figure 10A. Interaction of small residues is usually characteristic of tight van der Waals packing and weak hydrogen
bonds [40], which provide additional stability and specificity to interhelical interactions. Analysis of tightly packed
interhelical triplets of amino acid residues showed that
SS4 and GG4 sequence motifs are often found at the interhelical crossings of helices in polytopic integral membrane proteins [41]. Figure 10B demonstrantes that
subunits PetN and PetM from the cyanobacterium structure do not form any tight interhelical interactions. Here,
the conserved GG4 motif on the subunit PetM is found
packed against Tyr26 and Tyr29 from the subunit PetG
(Figure 10C). The homologue of the SS4 motif in PetN
from green alga is TA4 motif in cyanobacterium, which is
composed of Thr 16 and Ala 20. No tight packing is found
around these two residues in 1VF5.
Packing of the PetG and PetM subunits
The TM helices of the PetG and PetM subunits form a
right-handed parallel helical pair with a crossing angle of
-44° in 1Q90 (Figure 11A). The helical crossing point
occurs around two highly conserved residues (Gly8 and
Gly12) forming a GG4 motif (see the sequence logo on
Figure 11E) on the PetG subunit, and highly conserved
Ala70 (Ala9 in 1VF5) from the PetM subunit (Figure 10D)
These residues form a tightly packed high propensity AGG
residue triplet (Figure 11A) [41]. AGG triplets with GG4

motif on one helix and Ala residue on the other helix were
found in several other membrane proteins, such as glycerol facilitator (1FX8, Figure 11A), photosystem I (1JB0,
Figure 11C), and ClC Cl- chloride channel (1KPL, Figure
11D). Remarkably, all these triplets have similar configurations of residues and occur on parallel helical pairs with
crossing angles in the -33° – -48° range [41] implying that
this conserved structural motif is often used in membrane
proteins to promote folding and stability of membrane
proteins. The respective GG4 sequential pair is present in
the cyanobacterium PetG sequence as well; however, it
does not participate in any interhelical interaction. In fact,
only one of the conserved glycine residues (Gly12) is
resolved in 1VF5, while Gly8 is out of the TM region.
In summary, we find that the conserved faces of PetN,
PetL, and PetG subunits are hidden within the helical
bundle in green alga structure 1Q90, while in cyanobacterium structure 1VF5, the conserved helical faces of the
same subunits are often lipid-exposed. In addition, Hbonding potentials of amino acid side chains are better
satisfied in the structure of green algae than in the cyanobacterium structure. Sequence motifs such as GG4 and
SS4 in PetG, PetL and PetN subunits are found in tight
helix-helix packing interactions in the green alga cytochrome b6f structure, while such tight packing interactions are often missing in cyanobacterium 1VF5 structure.
Although our analysis is only suggestive, it shows that our
method can be helpful in resolving discrepancy in the
assignment of helical packing of low-resolution structures
of membrane proteins.

Discussion
The LIPS method uses TMLIP lipophilicity scales [24] and
conservation of the residues in the TM helix. A similar
approach (ProperTM) was used by Beuming and Weinstein for prediction of lipid-facing residues in membrane
proteins [23]. The difference between these two methods
is that LIPS is based on an explicit surface models and the
collective assessment of the physico-chemical and conservation properties of the residues forming a patch on the
surface of the TM helix. In the original Beuming and
Weinstein method [23], a cut-off value is used to classify
a particular residue as buried or exposed. The model of
helical faces was not used. Here, each of the seven overlapping patches is scored and ranked, eliminating the need
for the sequence-dependent cut-off to classify a residue as
buried or lipid-accessible. Another difference is in the calculation of lipid propensity. In TMLIP2, lipid propensity
is normalized to remove the bias of residue composition.
In [23], the calculation of Surface Propensity values for all
residues are scaled, so they fall between 0 and 1, but are
not normalized by residue composition.

The construction of helical patches is based on the structural analysis of helix-helix interfaces in 29 multispan
membrane proteins, which showed the abundance of
interacting heptad motifs in the TM helix-helix interfaces.
Our data are in agreement with results obtained by Langosh and Heringa [42] using a nearest neighbour analysis
on a set of three membrane proteins. They showed that
97% of all residues identified within the left-handed TM
helix-helix interfaces conformed to the heptad repeat pattern found in soluble coiled coils. However, it should be
noted that the packing of TM helices in membrane proteins is much more irregular than that found in the soluble coiled coils, where the concept of heptad repeats
originated. We use the heptad repeat here only to refer to
the interacting interfaces, and do not suggest that the overall global organization of TM helices is coiled coils.
Although the overall accuracy of prediction of lipidexposed helical faces in TM helices is almost 90%, the
LIPS calculations failed to correctly predict lipid-exposed
faces in 19 out of 162 lipid-accessible helices. Table 4 lists
some of these helices and summarizes possible reasons
why our predictions did not succeed for these proteins.

Among the 8 cases listed, we find that three are due to the
specific binding of cardiolipin, two are due to irregular
helix breaking, and one case is due to the overwhelming
amount of protein-heme interaction. Heme binding was
not explicitly modelled in this study because we only consider interhelical and helix-lipid interactions, and, therefore our prediction failed for this protein.
The failure to predict surfaces interacting with cardiolipin
is expected because of the high specificity of cardiolipin
binding. A previous evolutionary analysis of sequences of
reaction centers showed that the cardiolipin interaction
sites are preserved in terms of size, shape, and charge distribution by retaining certain types of amino acid side
chains at positions interacting with cardiolipin over a
wide range of photosynthetic bacteria [43]. This affects the
conservation component of the LIPS function by reducing
the average entropy of the lipid-exposed face and resulting
in a prediction that the involved residues are not lipidexposed.

Our analysis of failed predictions also shows that the
seven canonical helical faces method, which is based on a
heptad repeat motif, may not be applicable to helices with
kinks formed around Pro or Gly residues. Analysis of proline-containing TM helices showed that proline residues
are often found in the central region of TM helices, where
they may induce hinges that can be described by a kink
angle θ and swivel angle τ [44]. We find that the outcome
of the prediction of helix orientation for proline-containing helices using a canonical helical face approach is rarely
affected by the proline-induced kinks, if the swivel angles
are small. For example, residues involved in interhelical
interactions in the proline-containing helices B, C and F of
bacteriorhodopsin can be described by the continuous
sequence of a, d, e and g registers without any interruption, which results in the correct prediction of the lipidexposed helical face. The large swivel angles at Proinduced kinks result in rotation of one part of the helix
relative to another. In such cases, residues forming a helical face may end up on two different sides of the helix after

interfaces showed that the helix kinks induced by proline
residues rarely interrupt the heptad motif for contact
interfaces.
There are 11 failed predictions out of the 19 where we do
not have adequate rationalization. In three out of these 11
cases, LIPS proposed the second best choice for the lipidexposed face that shares a substantial number of residues
with the correct helical face. Because different membrane
proteins have homologous sequences from different species, the computed entropy values are not directly comparable and the absolute value of LIPS score cannot be used
as a quality indicator. To increase the probability of the
correct prediction, one should obtain as many orthologous sequences of the protein of interest as possible. It is
also useful to analyse helical faces with the largest and the
smallest LIPS scores together as we have shown on the
example of TRPV1 channel: the assignment of lipid-facing
and buried surfaces on the opposite sides of the helix is
often an indicator of a correct prediction. In addition, if
the boundaries of the helix are not known, it would be
very helpful to run several calculations to find the residues
of the high and low scoring faces and to derive a consensus lipid-exposed or buried face.
Finally, we have excluded TM helices that occur at the
physiologically important protein-protein interfaces from
the dataset for prediction of TM helix-lipid interfaces for
two reasons. First, because the residues at the physiologically important protein-protein interfaces of the membrane proteins are more conserved than the lipid-facing
residues and less conserved than the core residues [18],
the modeling of the evolution of TM helices at the protein-protein interfaces would require a more elaborate
approach. Second, a propensity scale derived from the residues occurring at the protein-protein interfaces should be
applied instead of TMLIP lipophilicity scales, which were
derived from the oligomeric structures of the membrane
proteins and are not applicable to the residues at proteinprotein interfaces.

A limitation of the current method is that the entropy calculation does not explicitly takes into account the phylogenetic relationships among the homologous proteins. A
future direction would be to explore the possibility of
using more advanced estimates of the evolutionary conservation, such as Evolutionary Trace [45], REVCOM [46],
CONSURF [47], and other available methods [48,49].
Another direction is to study the compatibility of proposed TM helix assignment directly with electron density
maps.

Conclusion
In this study, we have developed a method (LIPS) for prediction of the orientation of TM helices by locating lipidprotein interfaces. LIPS is based on the canonical helical
face model derived from the heptad repeat motif, which
allows collective assessment of the evolutionary and physico-chemical properties for each of the seven faces formed
by residues centered at one of the seven positions of the
heptad repeat. The LIPS scoring function predicts orientation of lipid-exposed TM helices in polytopic membrane
proteins with an accuracy of 88%. Our method can be
used for the prediction of helix orientation in the ab initio
modeling of polytopic membrane proteins. We also show
that LIPS calculations can identify questionable helix
assignments in membrane proteins with the example of
two cytochrome b6f structures.

1PV6, 1PW4, 1Q16, 1QLA, 1Q90, 1RH5. To estimate the
pattern of heptad repeat positions involved in helix-helix
interactions, we used helical pairs with at least three interacting residues. Amino acid residues from every helix in a
helical pair involved in the interhelical interaction form a
helical face, regardless of the number of the atomic interhelical contacts. Helices involved in multiple interhelical
interactions may have several unique or overlapping helical faces. We computed the best alignment to a heptad
repeat (positions a, d, e and g) for all residues in every helical face.

we took the conservative approach and included only
complete sequences with the same annotation as the
query protein and with sequence identity between 35%–
89% for multiple sequence alignments with ClustalW.
Each multiple sequence alignment profile was edited with
Pfaat multiple alignment viewer [54] to produce separate
blocks of sequences with no gaps for each TM helix.
LIPS scoring function
We use Shannon entropy H(i) to measure the level of conservation at each position i of the TM helical sequence as
described by Larson and Davidson [25]:

H(i) = −∑ pi (r )ln pi (r )

(1)

r

where pi(r) is the probability of amino acid type r in position i of the multiple sequence alignment of the TM helix.
For convenience, we choose the following modification:
E(i) = eH(i)

(2)

We calculate the average entropy and the average
lipophilicity for each helical face using TMLIP2-like scale
[24], which computed as regular TMLIP2 scale but without the protein that has been tested. The LIPS score Sf for
every helical face f is calculated as follows:
Sf = E f L f

(3)

where E f and L f are average entropy and average
lipophilicity of the helical face, respectively.
We use the VOLBL method [55] to compute lipid-accessible residues and their surface area as described previously
[24].
Sequence logos were built using weblogo generator [56].

Data set for prediction of TM helix orientation
We collected 18 membrane proteins that have at least 10
homologous sequences for generating a good multiple
sequence alignment. These proteins are listed in Table 1.
The homologous sequences were found in the NR database using BLAST and PSI-BLAST searches. In most cases,
