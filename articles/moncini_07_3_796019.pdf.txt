Abstract
Background: CDK5R1 plays a central role in neuronal migration and differentiation during central
nervous system development. CDK5R1 has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders and
proposed as a candidate gene for mental retardation. The remarkable size of CDK5R1 3'untranslated region (3'-UTR) suggests a role in post-transcriptional regulation of CDK5R1
expression.
Results: The bioinformatic study shows a high conservation degree in mammals and predicts
several AU-Rich Elements (AREs). The insertion of CDK5R1 3'-UTR into luciferase 3'-UTR causes
a decreased luciferase activity in four transfected cell lines. We identified 3'-UTR subregions which
tend to reduce the reporter gene expression, sometimes in a cell line-dependent manner. In most
cases the quantitative analysis of luciferase mRNA suggests that CDK5R1 3'-UTR affects mRNA
stability. A region, leading to a very strong mRNA destabilization, showed a significantly low halflife, indicating an accelerated mRNA degradation. The 3' end of the transcript, containing a class I
ARE, specifically displays a stabilizing effect in neuroblastoma cell lines. We also observed the
interaction of the stabilizing neuronal RNA-binding proteins ELAV with the CDK5R1 transcript in
SH-SY5Y cells and identified three 3'-UTR sub-regions showing affinity for ELAV proteins.
Conclusion: Our findings evince the presence of both destabilizing and stabilizing regulatory
elements in CDK5R1 3'-UTR and support the hypothesis that CDK5R1 gene expression is posttranscriptionally controlled in neurons by ELAV-mediated mechanisms. This is the first evidence of
the involvement of 3'-UTR in the modulation of CDK5R1 expression. The fine tuning of CDK5R1
expression by 3'-UTR may have a role in central nervous system development and functioning, with
potential implications in neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders.

Background
CDK5R1 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 regulatory subunit 1)
encodes for p35, a protein required for the activation of
cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), whose activity plays a
key role in central nervous system development [1]. Monomeric CDK5 does not show any enzymatic activity,
requiring association with its regulatory partners p35 or
p39. During neuronal migration, p35-activated CDK5
phosphorylates NudEL, the homologous of an Aspergillus
nidulans gene involved in nuclear translocation and in
cytoskeletal organization of migrating neurons by dynein
regulation [2]. In mouse, Cdk5 modulates PAK kinases
and is implicated in actin reorganization, which may be
critical for neuron migration along radial glia [3]. In mice
lacking Cdk5 or p35, abnormal formation of cortical layers occurs: a loss of the Cdk5 pathway appears to affect
later migrating neurons as the cortical layers emerge from
the cortical plate [4,5], leading to severe cortical lamination defects, adult mortality and seizures [5,6]. The
absence of p39 did not produce aberrant phenotype, indicating a predominant role of p35 in CDK5 activation [7].
It is also known that both Cdk5 and p35 concentrate at
the leading edges of axonal growth cones and have been
shown to regulate neuritis outgrowth in cortical neuron
culture [8]. The active CDK5/p35 complex is involved in
further processes required for central nervous system
development and function, such as axonal regeneration
[9], cellular differentiation, neuronal apoptosis [10],
learning and memory processes [11], synaptic transmission [12] and membrane trafficking during the outgrowth
of neuronal processes [13]. Hyperactivity of CDK5 mediated by p25, a proteolytic fragment of p35, has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease [14], Parkinson's disease [15] and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [16].
In fact, phosphorylated neurofilaments and their associated kinases, most of which are represented by CDK5,
were found in protein aggregates typical of neurodegenerative diseases. Findings on CDK5R1 deletion in patients
with NF1 microdeletion syndrome showing mental retardation [17,18] and the recently reported CDK5R1 mutations in non-syndromic mental retardation patients [19],
pinpoint the gene as a candidate for mental retardation
susceptibility in NF1 microdeletion syndrome and in a
subgroup of non-syndromic mental retarded patients.
More recently the CDK5/p35 complex has also been
reported to regulate several activities such as exocytosis,
gene transcription, tissue regeneration, senescence, apoptosis and hormone regulation also in extra-neuronal cells
[20].
Given the key role of CDK5R1 in the development, differentiation and physiology of brain and its involvement in
extra-neuronal cell activities, it is conceivable that accu-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/111

rate spatio-temporal regulation of its expression is
needed. CDK5R1 is characterized by an extended 3'-UTR
(2725 bp), which accounts for about 75% of the whole
transcript and is among the 5% longest annotated 3'-UTRs
[21]. We recently reported the presence of known regulatory elements in CDK5R1 3'-UTR such as a potential GYbox motif (GUCUUCC, nt 1341–1347) and three putative AU-Rich Elements (AREs) at the 3' end of the transcript [19]; GY-box has been validated as microRNA target
in Drosophila [22,23]; AREs have a well known role in
post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA stability and
degradation through the binding of specific factors [24].
These features suggest a role for the 3'-UTR in the control
of CDK5R1 expression.
3'-UTRs have been shown to play crucial roles in a wide
variety of regulatory mechanisms [25], including modulation of mRNA stability and degradation [24,26], translation efficiency [27], transport out of the nucleus and subcellular localization of mRNA [28]. Expression of several
important nervous system genes, including genes encoding neurotransmitter receptors, biosynthetic enzymes,
cytoskeletal proteins, growth factors and associated proteins, are known to be regulated by functional elements in
their 3'-UTRs [29-33]. Indeed, post-transcriptional regulation exerted by the 3'-UTR has been proposed as an effective counterpart to the mechanism of transcription in fine
modulation of gene expression, in particular during the
development of the central nervous system [34]. The
importance of 3'-UTRs in regulating gene expression is
also underlined by the finding that mutations affecting
the 3'-UTR can lead to serious pathologies [35,36]. The
role of the 3'-UTR for appropriated gene control has been
demonstrated [37] and it is possible that certain disorders
of neuronal plasticity and learning are due to perturbations in 3'-UTR-mediated functions [35].
Thus, regulatory elements within the 3'-UTR of CDK5R1
are likely to be involved in the tuning of its expression
during central nervous system development and neuronal
migration, acting on mRNA stability, translation efficiency and/or sub-cellular localization. Nevertheless, to
our knowledge, studies on CDK5R1 3'-UTR function have
not yet been reported.
In order to explore the role of CDK5R1 3'-UTR we have
predicted additional regulatory elements and performed
functional studies by means of dual luciferase assays and
mRNA quantification, observing that the 3'-UTR decreases
the reporter activity in different cell lines and that different regulatory elements are present, some with stabilizing
and others with destabilizing function. We have identified
regulatory regions showing cell-line specificity, in particular we have identified a region showing a destabilizing
effect caused by increased mRNA degradation. We have

also observed a stabilizing effect of the 3' end region containing a canonical ARE in two neuroblastoma cell lines
and have obtained evidence of binding of the neuronalspecific ELAV (nELAV) proteins to CDK5R1 mRNA.
We report the first evidence on the involvement of
CDK5R1 3'-UTR in the modulation of gene expression.
These findings suggest that CDK5R1 3'-UTR may contribute to modulate its expression during central nervous system development and functioning. The impairment of
this mechanism may be involved in the pathogenesis of
both neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders.

As functional AREs are likely to be exposed in loops accessible to AU-rich binding proteins, we predicted the
CDK5R1 3'-UTR secondary structure by using the Sfold
RNA-folding algorithm [39]: this analysis indicated that
in the most stable predicted structure only three possible
AREs are accessible in a single-stranded loop, in particular
the ARE that follows the ARED consensus criteria (nt
2659–2671) (Fig. 1C). In addition, this ARE is excluded
from RNA duplexes even in the other predicted secondary
structures, which show higher free energies (data not
shown). The secondary structure analysis of the region of
CDK5R1 3'-UTR surrounding the GY-box motif has previously been described [19].

Results
CDK5R1 3'-UTR is highly conserved in mammals and
contains several putative regulatory elements
We previously predicted a potential GY-box and three
putative AREs in CDK5R1 3'-UTR [19]. In order to refine
the search for potential Class I/II AREs we looked for the
AUUUA pentameric motif in the whole CDK5R1 3'-UTR
sequence: we found eight pentamers, among which two
are isolated and six are flanked at one or both sides by AU
stretches (Fig. 1A). None of these putative AREs show
AUUUA pentamers arranged in tandem, a feature of Class
II AREs, which indicates that these motifs might belong to
Class I. Nevertheless, only one of the eight potential AREs
(nt 2659–2671) corresponds perfectly to the consensus
sequence (WWWUAUUUAUUUW), according to the
ARED 3.0 database definition [38], while the other possible AREs show at least two mismatches.

Furthermore, we assessed the conservation between
human, mouse and rat CDK5R1 3'-UTRs, which have very
similar lengths (2725 bp, 2779 bp and 2683 bp, respectively). The comparison, performed with the mVISTA tool
(Fig. 1A), indicates that the three sequences show several
regions of at least 100 bp with more than 70% identity,
notably in their proximal and terminal portions, with an
overall sequence identity of 76.8% and of 76.3% for the
human-mouse and the human-rat pair, respectively; the
most conserved portion of human CDK5R1 3'-UTR is the
3'-end, which has about 95% identity with both its mouse
and rat counterpart. Based on this analysis, the three most
terminal putative AREs (nt 2539–2551, nt 2636–2645
and nt 2659–2671) are completely conserved, while the
other five show one or more mismatches. It is worth noting that, though the zebrafish Cdk5r1 3'-UTR, assembled
by EST analysis, shows a high level of divergence with the
sequences of mammals, the portion corresponding to the
CDK5R1 3'-UTR ARE that matches the ARED consensus is
nearly completely conserved, with the exception of only
one nucleotide (Fig. 1B). As far as the GY-box element is
concerned, there is only one mismatch between human,
mouse and rat, while this element seems to be absent in
zebrafish (data not shown).

Human CDK5R1 3'-UTR decreases reporter gene activity
The effect of the 3'-UTR on gene expression was studied
with the luciferase reporter assay. A construct was generated carrying the human CDK5R1 3'-UTR downstream of
the reporter gene (Fig. 2A).

The construct pGL4.71P-UTR was transiently transfected
in neuroblastoma cell lines SK-N-BE and SH-SY5Y, in
human embryonic kidney HEK-293 cells and breast
tumor MCF-7 cell lines. Luciferase activity was measured
24 hours after transfection.
The ARE region of Bcl2 gene from nt 942 to 1020 (GenBank M14745) has been used as a positive control (construct pGL4.71P-b-ARE) as it was shown to have a
degradation activity on the mRNA [40]. pGL4.71P-b-ARE
leads to a decrease in luciferase activity in all four cell lines
(data not shown).
The luciferase activity of construct pGL4.71P-UTR was significantly lower in the four transfected cell lines compared
to the insertion-less pGL4.71P vector (p < 0.01) (Fig. 2B).
The amount of reporter RNAs in the cell lines transfected
with the above luciferase constructs was quantified by
RealTime RT-PCR in order to identify whether the
decrease in luciferase activity was due to lower mRNA levels. Data were normalized to Firefly to control for transfection efficiency and for the housekeeping gene GAPDH.
The levels of mRNA for each sample correlated with the
luciferase activity, with the exception of SH-SY5Y cells
where the transcript level is similar to the insertion-less
pGL4.71P vector (Fig. 2C).
CDK5R1 3'-UTR fragments differently affect reporter
gene expression
In order to study whether the destabilizing effect on luciferase activity can be assigned to specific regions, the 3'UTR was divided into six smaller fragments (C1-C6) each
containing at least one putative regulatory element
according to the in silico prediction described above, and
six luciferase reporter constructs were generated (Fig. 3A).

For each construct we performed a dual luciferase assay as
described above. Fragmentation of the 3'-UTR shows that
pGL4.71P-C2, pGL4.71P-C4 and pGL4.71P-C5 lead to a
considerable decrease in luciferase activity in all cell lines
(p < 0.01) indicating the presence of destabilizing regulatory elements (Fig. 3B). In particular, pGL4.71P-C2 has
the strongest decrease of luciferase activity observed, by
more than 80% compared to the control construct. The
other fragments decrease luciferase activity with significant difference among cell lines, showing destabilization
in all lines with exception of HEK-293 for pGL4.71P-C1
and SK-N-BE and HEK-293 for pGL4.71P-C3. pGL4.71PC6 decreases luciferase activity only in HEK-293 and
MCF-7 cells (p < 0.01) and was not effective in neuroblastoma derived lines.

activity of the chimeric reporter gene, normalized for transfection efficiency against the Firefly luciferase activity, is represented as a percentage of the activity observed in cells
transfected with pGL4.71P (defined as 100%). Means ± s.d.
luciferase values were obtained from at least four independent experiments (* p < 0.01 compared with the corresponding pGL4.71P value). C) mRNA levels of the chimeric
transcript. Total RNA was extracted from the cells harvested
24 hours post-transfection, and the reporter gene mRNA
levels were analyzed by RealTime PCR as described. mRNA
levels of the chimeric reporter gene, normalized against the
housekeeping gene GAPDH and for transfection efficiency
against the Firefly luciferase mRNA levels, are represented as
a percentage of the mRNA levels observed in cells transfected with pGL4.71P (defined as 100%). Means ± s.d. luciferase mRNA values were obtained from at least three
independent experiments (* p < 0.01 compared with the corresponding pGL4.71P value).

The quantitation of the above luciferase constructs
mRNAs in SK-N-BE, SH-SY5Y, HEK-293 and MCF-7 cell
lines by RealTime RT-PCR correlated in most cases with
the luciferase activity. Exceptions were the constructs
pGL4.71P-C2 in SH-SY5Y, pGL4.71P-C4 in SK-N-BE and
SH-SY5Y and pGL4.71P-C5 in MCF-7 in which the reduction of mRNA levels was not so marked as the correspondent luciferase activity (Fig. 3C). These data were
normalized as previously described.
C2 fragment increases the rate of degradation of the
reporter mRNA in an ARE independent way
As the pGL4.71P-C2 construct led to the strongest reduction of luciferase activity and mRNA level (Fig. 3) we performed a degradation assay in order to determine whether
accelerated mRNA decay can contribute to the observed
reduction in luciferase activity and mRNA in SK-N-BE
cells.

We performed a real-time quantitative RT-PCR to compare mRNA levels between the pGL4.71P-C2 and
pGL4.71P in SK-N-BE cells at various times after the addition of the transcriptional inhibitor DRB, which was initially added 24 hours following transfection. These data
were normalized on transfection efficiency by using Firefly mRNA levels and GAPDH expression as housekeeping
gene. With respect to mRNA decay, the calculated half-life
of the pGL4.71P-C2 construct was 5,73 h, significantly
lower compared to the insertion-less construct pGL4.71Pbeing > 8 h (Fig. 4A). These findings suggest that an accelerated degradation of mRNA has contributed to the
observed reduction in reporter gene expression and
mRNA associated with the C2 fragment.
In order to restrict the region causing the accelerate degradation of C2 fragment and to determine the role of the
potential nt 992–1001 ARE motif, we divided the C2 fragment, according to the presence of conserved stretches,
into 3 sub-fragments named C2.1 (138 bp), C2.2 (240

bp) and C2.3 (365 bp) (Fig. 4B) the latter containing the
nt 992–1001 ARE. This fragments were cloned in the
above described reporter vector.
For each construct we performed a dual luciferase assay
and the quantization of the luciferase constructs mRNAs
as described above. Fragmentation of C2 shows that only
pGL4.71P-C2.1 leads to a considerable decrease in luciferase activity and mRNA level in all cell lines (p < 0.01)
indicating the presence of unknown regulatory element/s
with a destabilizing effect (Fig. 4C and 4D). It is worth to
be noted that the C2.3 construct, containing the putative
ARE, does not reduce both luciferase and mRNA levels.
Class I ARE (nt 2659–2671) has a stabilizing effect in
neuroblastoma cells while GY-box element does not affect
reporter gene expression
We focused on the only canonical ARE (nt 2659–2671),
localized in the C6 fragment, which has the consensus
sequence for a class I ARE, and on the GY-box element,
localized in the C3 fragment.

To verify the actual function of the putative class I ARE,
the region from nt 2637 to 2687, encompassing the ARE
element, was deleted from C6 fragment (Fig. 5A). As
shown in Fig. 5B, pGL4.71P-C6del luciferase activity is
lower in comparison with that of the insertion-less plasmid (p < 0.01) in all four cell lines. It is worth noting that
in SK-N-BE and SH-SY5Y lines, the mRNA level of the
pGL4.71P-C6del construct decreases in sharp contrast
with the non-deleted construct (p < 0.01) indicating that
the class I ARE might act as a stabilizing element in these
cell lines (Fig. 5C).
Regarding the GY-box, the sequence GTCTTCC (nt 1341–
1347) was deleted from the C3 fragment. Normalized
luciferase activity was not affected by the constructs with
deleted GY-box in comparison with the corresponding
non deleted construct in all the tested cell lines (data not
shown), indicating the inactivity of this element in the cell
lines used.
CDK5R1 mRNA is a target of nELAV RNA-binding proteins
Since CDK5R1 3'UTR contains several putative ARE
sequences and the ARE-containing C6 fragment seems to
confer mRNA stability specifically in the neuronal SK-NBE and SH-SY5Y cell lines, we investigated whether neuronal RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are involved in the posttranscriptional control of CDK5R1 mRNA. Among the
ARE-binding proteins the ELAV family is of interest since
three members (HuB, HuC, HuD) out of four are selectively expressed in neurons and display a stabilizing effect
on target mRNAs. We tested the binding of the nELAV
RBPs to the CDK5R1 transcript by immunoprecipitating
endogenous mRNA-protein (mRNP) complexes from SH-

Discussion
CDK5R1 is known to be a key regulator of central nervous
system development and functioning [1] and it has
recently been shown to have several extra-neuronal roles
[20]. CDK5R1 3'-UTR is longer than the eukaryotic 3'-UTR
average [24], belonging to the 5% longest annotated
3'UTRs [21] and was recently reported to contain potential post-transcriptional regulatory elements [19], suggesting that it may be important for the control of CDK5R1
gene expression. The particular features of CDK5R1 3'UTR and the lack of functional data prompted us to study
its role in the control of gene expression by means of bioinformatic analysis and dual luciferase and RealTime PCR
assays of chimeric constructs.

CDK5R1 mRNA is bound by nELAV proteins in SHSY5Y cells. A) Endogenous mRNP complexes were selectively immunoprecipitated from SH-SY5Y cells using the pan
neuronal ELAV and the irrelevant IgG antibodies. The bound
mRNAs were analyzed by RT-PCR with primer pairs specific
for CDK5R1 (left panel) and GAP-43 (right panel). MW,
Molecular weight marker; +, positive control (total SH-SY5Y
cDNA); -, negative control (no sample). B) In vitro RNA-protein binding experiments were performed by UV cross-linking of different P32-radiolabelled regions from CDK5R1 3'UTR
and brain protein lysate. A selective immunoprecipitation of
the formed mRNP complex was performed using the nELAV
antibody (lanes 2–5). As a negative control a mix of all the
different riboprobes was used and immunoprecipitated by
the IgG antibody (-, lane 1), while GAP-43 3'UTR riboprobe
was used as a positive control (+, lane 5).

mRNAs (Fig. 6A). We also used the irrelevant IgG antibody as a negative control in the assay to confirm that the
CDK5R1 mRNA was selectively isolated only from nELAVimmunoprecipitated mRNP complexes
In order to map the binding of nELAV proteins along the
CDK5R1 transcript, we dissected the 3'UTR into four subregions corresponding to the ARE containing fragments
C1, C2, C4-5 and C6, and used them in in vitro UV crosslinking experiments. The radio-labelled C1, C2, C4-5 and
C6 riboprobes were incubated in the presence of brain
protein lysates and, after UV irradiation, the formed
mRNP complexes were immunoprecipitated by the
nELAV antibody and resolved on SDS-PAGE. We observed
that nELAV RBPs recognized and bound C1, C2 and C6
sub-regions, while the C4-5 fragment did not form mRNP
complexes with nELAV proteins (Fig. 6B).

We have shown that the CDK5R1 3'-UTR can down-regulate luciferase expression and we assessed the presence of
different sub-regions that can independently affect transcript stability and, in a few cases, translational efficiency
in different cell lines.
The high degree of conservation showed by CDK5R1 3'UTR is strongly indicative of a functional role of this
region and suggests the presence of different post-transcriptional regulatory elements [41]. In particular several
AREs were predicted, a feature typical of mRNAs with high
turnover rate [42], among which the nt 2659–2671 ARE
shows complete identity to the ARE consensus sequence,
according to the ARED 3.0 definition. Together with the
high phylogenetic conservation in mammals and
zebrafish and with the predicted accessibility to the binding of trans-acting factors, the functionality of this element can be hypothesized. It is worth noting that
functional AREs are present in the 3'-UTR of many cyclin
mRNAs [43], raising the hypothesis that ARE-mediated
post-transcriptional regulation may be a common mechanism for the control of expression in this class of genes, to
which CDK5R1 belongs.
The pGL4.71P-UTR construct shows a decreased luciferase
activity in all the cell lines according to mRNA level with
the exception of SH-SY5Y cells, showing an mRNA level
comparable to that of the control, which could be
explained by the action of mechanisms controlling the
translation. The overall effect of the large CDK5R1 3'-UTR
may be the result of a complex regulation mechanism
mediated by multiple 3'-UTR domains that act independently of each other, as has been already highlighted in
BCL2, Cox-2, VEGF and c-Fos mRNAs [40,44-48]. The dissection of 3'-UTR into 6 fragments, each containing at
least one predicted regulatory element, allowed us to
investigate the potential role of each region. All the chimeric constructs showed, in most of the studied cell lines,
a general decrease of luciferase activity. In most cases these
effects are likely to involve transcript stability rather than

translational repression mechanisms, since reduced
reporter activity levels corresponded, as determined by
RealTime RT-PCR experiments, to diminished mRNA levels. In some instances the reduction of luciferase activity
may be the result of mechanisms affecting both mRNA
stability and translational efficiency. This effect is particularly evident for C2 and 3'-UTR constructs in SH-SY5Y cell
line, suggesting that some elements influencing the
behavior of the entire CDK5R1 3'-UTR may be found in
the C2 region (Fig. 2 and 3).
The strong reduction of luciferase activity and RNA
induced by C2 fragment in all the transfected cell lines
suggests the presence of one or more regulatory elements
with a potent destabilizing function supported by the degradation assay results. We found that the C2.3 fragment,
containing the only known putative element (nt 992–
1001 ARE), is not responsible for the low expression of
the C2 fragment and thus this ARE, which is not conserved
in rodents, is unlikely to be a destabilizing element. On
the other hand, the decreased expression of pGL4.71PC2.1 construct, in which none putative regulatory elements are predicted, prompts us to hypothesize the presence of novel regulatory elements in the C2.1 fragment.
Further studies will be necessary to identify the post-transcriptional mechanisms leading to mRNA degradation of
the above construct.
The non-destabilizing effect detected in HEK-293 cells for
the C1 fragment and in SK-N-BE and SH-SY5Y for C6
allows us to hypothesize that these regions are bound by
cell-line specific stabilizing factors. The deletion in the C6
fragment of the canonical nt 2659–2671 ARE reduced
mRNA levels in all the analyzed cell lines, including SK-NBE and SH-SY5Y. This finding strongly suggests a stabilizing role of the canonical element in neuroblastomaderived cells through the binding of neuronal-specific stabilizing factors expressed in SK-N-BE and SH-SY5Y cells
(Fig. 4). The prediction that this ARE is within a singlestranded loop further supports this hypothesis. Several
ARE binding proteins are known, some of which promote
the stabilization of their target mRNAs, including cyclin
mRNAs [24,43]. Among these proteins, the neuronal specific nELAV RBPs, HuB, HuC and HuD, play a key role in
the induction of neuronal differentiation [49-51] and
have a stabilizing effect on several transcripts containing
AREs in their 3'-UTR [52,53]. The expression of HuB and
HuD has been demonstrated in several neuroblastoma
cell lines [54].
Our immunoprecipitation assays show that the neuronalspecific nELAV RBPs bind to CDK5R1 transcript in SHSY5Y cells. The UV cross-linking experiments allowed us
to observe that C1, C2 and C6 sub-regions show affinity
for nELAV proteins in vitro while, although C4-5 contains

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/111

putative AREs, it does not bind to nELAV RBPs. The luciferase activity together with the RealTime PCR results in
comparison to UV cross-linking data, suggest that the
binding shown by C1 and C2 regions for nELAV may be
not so effective in vivo as in the case of C6 region. This
finding might be explained by possible interactions of
these regions with further regulatory destabilizing factors
or to possible formation of unfavourable secondary
mRNA structures. According to the RNA-operon model,
trans-acting factors regulate mRNAs within a coordinated
pathway of RNA processing, providing cells of a fast and
dynamic tool to respond to environmental cues [55].
Our results on interaction of the nELAV factors with
CDK5R1 messenger in a neuronal cell line support the
hypothesis of a neuron-specific post-transcriptional regulation of CDK5R1 expression. This mechanism may be
activated during central nervous system development to
rapidly increase dosage of a protein such as p35, characterized by a rapid turnover through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [56].
The generation of a construct with the canonical GY-box
motif deleted revealed the inactivity of this element in all
the cell lines used for the transfection experiments. These
data indicate that this motif does not seem to be involved
in the regulation of CDK5R1 expression.
Our findings have shown the presence of several regulatory elements in CDK5R1 3'-UTR, and for a few of them
we assessed a destabilizing or stabilizing function. The 3'UTR seems to contain some regulatory elements implicated in rapid mRNA turnover which, as a consequence,
maintain the steady-state transcript at low levels, and others which have a cell-specific stabilizing effect on the transcript that may contribute to rapidly increase the
expression of CDK5R1 during specific biological processes. Thus the 3'-UTR may exert a key role in fine tuning
of CDK5R1 expression that in turn might be crucial during
the complex processes underlying correct central nervous
system development and neuronal survival in which
CDK5R1 is involved [12,57]. The active CDK5-p35 complex is strongly involved in neurofilament phosphorylation and its aberrant hyperactivity has been shown to be
implicated in neurodegenerative diseases [58]. It has
recently been demonstrated in mouse that p35 protein
level is a rate-limiting factor for the up-regulation of Cdk5
activity [59]. Thus an up-regulation of CDK5R1 expression in neurons may have pathological implications causing neurodegenerative diseases. On the other hand, the
absence of p35 leads to abnormalities in the laminar
structure of cerebral cortex, affecting actin-cyotskeletal
dynamics and microtubule regulation [60], and severe
mental retardation was shown by patients with NF1
microdeletion syndrome with the lack of one copy of

CDK5R1 [18]. According to our results we hypothize that
an up- or down-regulation of CDK5R1 expression, caused
by defective post-transcriptional mechanisms, may have
pathogenetic implications in neurodegenerative disorders
or cognitive impairment-based diseases, respectively.
Despite the fact that p35 activity has primarily been associated with central nervous system, several extra-neuronal
roles of p35 have recently been shown, causing direct or
indirect effects on the organization of cytoskeletal structures [20]. The CDK5R1 expression is likely to be finely
controlled also in non-neuronal tissues. Our findings on
non-neuronal cell lines suggest that the 3'-UTR might be
involved in the post-transcriptional control of CDK5R1
expression in different tissues and that an alteration of
this mechanism may cause cellular dysfunction and disease. The large 3'-UTR of CDK5R1 is expected to contain
further regulatory elements, creating the possibility of
complex gene expression modulation [61].

Conclusion
Our study evidences for the first time the involvement of
3'-UTR in the modulation of CDK5R1 expression by the
presence of both destabilizing and stabilizing cis-regulatory elements in 3'-UTR, also supporting the hypothesis
that CDK5R1 gene expression is controlled in neurons by
nELAV-mediated mechanisms, with potential implications in neurodegenerative and cognitive disorders.
Additional studies are necessary to validate the biological
function of the predicted regulatory elements and to identify novel cis-acting regulatory motifs such as microRNA
target sites, in order to evince the role of 3'-UTR in the regulation of CDK5R1 expression. This search may eventually clarify the molecular basis of some neurological
diseases and in perspective the validated regulatory elements may represent new pharmacological targets for
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Methods
Bioinformatic analysis
The human and mouse CDK5R1 3'-UTR sequences
(3HSA086450 and 3MMU05479) were obtained from the
UTRdb database [62] and correspond to the 3'-UTR of the
NCBI Reference Sequence cDNAs NM_003885 and
NM_009971, respectively [63]. The rat and zebrafish
Cdk5r1 3'-UTR sequences were assembled starting from
the ESTs annotated in the UCSC Genome Browser (rat
assembly version 3.4 (rn4) and zebrafish assembly version 6 (Zv6)) using the CAP3 sequence assembly program
[64] with default parameter values. The AREs were
searched using the PatSearch program [65], looking for
the AUUUA pentamer; the results were compared with the
annotation proposed by the ARED 3.0 database [38].
Comparative analysis was carried out using the LAGAN

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/111

alignment program of mVISTA [66]. and the ClustalX program [67]. The Sfold software was used for the prediction
of CDK5R1 3'-UTR secondary structure [39].
3'-UTR constructs
Segments of the human CDK5R1 3'-UTR were PCR-amplified using primers containing flanking XbaI recognition
sequence (Table 1). The segment in the 3'-UTR from
nucleotide 1167 to 1408 carrying the deletion of the GYbox element, named C3del, was obtained by nested deletion of the GY-box element (GCTCCTT) from nucleotide
1341 to 1347. Two partially overlapping PCR products
were synthesized for this purpose, as described by [68].
Briefly, the first PCR product was amplified with C3 FW
(see Table 1) and 5'-GGGCCTAGAATCCTCTGTAGTGTCTTCA-3' GYdel reverse primers. The second PCR
product was amplified with 5'-AGGCCCAGTCCACTGGGGA-3' (GYdel FW) and C3 REV primers. The 6 overlapping nucleotides are italicized in GYdel REV and GYdel
FW primers. The PCR products were ligated in the XbaI
restriction site downstream of the Renilla luciferase coding region of the pGL4.71 vector (Promega, Madison, WI)
in which the SV40 promoter region from the pGL3-Promoter vector (Promega) was previously cloned to obtain
the pGL4.71P plasmid. Correct orientation of the insert
was verified by sequencing.
Cell Cultures
Human neuroblastoma SK-N-BE cells were cultured in
RPM-I medium with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/
ml penicillin-streptomycin, 0.01 mM L-glutamine,
sodium pyruvate 11 g/l and glucose 4.5 g/l. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and human embryonic kidney
HEK-293 cells were maintained in DMEM medium with
10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin and 0.01
mM L-glutamine. Human breast tumor MCF-7 cells were
cultured in RPM-I medium with 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin and 0.01 mM L-glutamine (all media
ingredients were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, AS, Oslo,
Norway). Cultures were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2
incubator.
Cell transfection
For luciferase activity assays, 2.5–4.5 × 106 cells were
plated in 6-well dishes in 2 ml of medium 24 hours before
transfection. Cells were transfected at 60–70% confluence
with 300 ng of the pGL4.71P constructs containing different CDK5R1 3'-UTR fragments. To normalize the value of
Renilla luciferase activity for transfection efficiency and
cell viability after transfection, the pGL3-Promoter Firefly
luciferase reporter gene was co-transfected (300 ng). For
transfection 2 µl of LIPOFECTAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen,
Burlington, ON) were used according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Measurement of luciferase activity
Luciferase reporter assays were performed using the DualGlo Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega). 24
hours after transfection, the culture medium was
removed, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered
saline. Passive Lysis Buffer (350 µl of 1× buffer) was added
to each well, and plates were placed in a shaking incubator for 30 minutes at room temperature. For additional
lysis, two freeze-thaw cycles were performed in which the
cells were frozen to -80°C. 50 µl of Dual-Glo Luciferase
Reagent were added to 50–100 µl of lysate and incubated
for 30 minutes. Firefly luciferase luminescence (pGL3P
vector) was measured. Before measurement of Renilla
luciferase (pGL4.71P vector), 50 µl of the Stop & Glo reagent were added to each well to quench the firefly luciferase reaction. Renilla luciferase luminescence was
measured after an incubation of 30 minutes. Relative
Renilla luciferase light output was normalized to Firefly
luciferase output. Firefly-normalized luciferase activity for
the construct was compared with the insertion-less
pGL4.71P vector. The data were expressed as means ± s.d.
Statistical significance was calculated by using a Student's
t test. A difference between two means was considered statistically significant when p < 0.01.
Total RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative
PCR
For total mRNA assays, 0.85–1.5 × 106 cells were plated in
a 25 cm2 flask in 4 ml of medium 24 hours before transfection. Cells were co-transfected at 60–70% confluence
with 500 ng pGL3P and 500 ng of pGL4.71P construct

containing different CDK5R1 3'-UTR fragments, using 4 µl
of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was extracted using
NucleoSpin RNA II Columns (Macherey-Nagel, Düren,
Germany) according to manufacturer's instructions. To
eliminate amplification of reporter plasmid DNA and
genomic DNA, total RNA was treated with Turbo DNAfree (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) at 37°C for 30 minutes.
RNA (4 µg) was reverse transcribed with High Capacity
cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City,
CA). The level of luciferase transcripts was determined
using RealTime quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR
using the TaqMan system (Applied Biosystems Inc.) using
specific primers and probes for Renilla luciferase, Firefly
luciferase and Glyseraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Renilla and Firefly luciferase quantification data were normalized on expression of the
housekeeping gene GAPDH, and then the Renilla data
were normalized on transfection efficiency by using
Firelfy mRNA levels.
In mRNA decay assays SK-N-BE cells were treated with
5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribobenzimidazole (DRB) (1 µg/
ml) 24 hours post-transfection to suppress the transcription of the luciferase reporter gene. Cells were harvested at
0, 1.5, 3, 5 and 8 hours after treatment with DRB and RNA
isolated for real time RT-PCR analysis.
mRNP isolation and immunoprecipitation
Isolation of endogenous mRNPs was conducted with
minor modifications to [69] and as already described

[53]. Briefly, 2 × 106 SH-SY5Y cells were harvested for each
experiment and resuspended in RNP buffer (100 mM KCl,
5 mM MgCl2, 10 Mm HEPES pH 7.4, 0.5% NP-40).
Lysates were incubated in 1 ml NT2 buffer (50 mM TrisHCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 20
mM EDTA, 0.05% NP-40) together with protein G Sepharose-beads (GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT) pre-coated with
4 µg of pan neuronal ELAV (16A11, Invitrogen) or Ig-G
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies.
RNA was phenol-cloroform extracted from immunoprecipitated mRNPs after treatment with proteinase K for 30
minutes. After DNaseI digestion, the isolated mRNAs were
retro-transcribed using SuperScriptII RT (Invitrogen) and
oligodT primers. RT-PCR was performed in two-rounds
amplifications (20 cycles for the first round and 20–25
cycles for the second one) with primers pairs for CDK5R1
(For CCACAGGAATAATAGTTCAGG; Rev GAATCAGCACAGTACAAAAATA) and GAP43 (For TGATGCTGCCACAGAGCAGG; Rev TGGGAAAGGACAGACTCACA
GACGTG). Amplifications products were run on 1% agarose gel in TAE buffer.
In vitro transcription and UV cross-linking
Radio-labelled riboprobes were obtained by transcribing
0.5 µg restriction enzyme-linearized construct DNA with
20 U T7 RNA polymerase (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), 20
µCi α-[32P]UTP, 0.5 mM NTPs, and 20 U RNase inhibitor
(Promega). After template DNA removal by DNaseI digestion, the resulting 32P-labelled riboprobes were purified
on ProbeQuant G-50 microcolumns (GE Healthcare). UV
cross-linking and immunoprecipitation experiments were
performed as previously described [53] using the pan neuronal ELAV antibody (16A11, Invitrogen), which recognizes the three neuronal ELAV proteins but not HuR.
300,000 cpm of riboprobes were incubated with 40 µg of
brain protein extract in 15 µl ligation buffer (1.3 mM
MgCl2, 19 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.4, 1.5 mM ATP, 19 mM
Creatine phosphate) for 10 minutes at 30°C. After addition of 5 µg tRNA, samples were irradiated with UV light
(Stratalinker®, Stratagene) for 5 minutes and RNaseAtreated (25 U) for 30 minutes. Immunoprecipitation was
conducted on UV cross-linked samples by the addition of
4 µg of the selected antibody pre-coated to protein G
Sepharose-beads. Immunocomplexes were then collected
by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 seconds, washed
several times in NT2 buffer, run on a 10% SDS-PAGE and
analyzed by autoradiography.
