Abstract
Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of the method that unilateral pedicle screws asymmetric
tethering in concave side in combination with convex rib resection for creating idiopathic
deformity.
Summary of background data: Various methods are performed to create idiopathic deformity.
Among these methods, posterior asmmetric tethering of the spine shows satisfying result, but
some drawbacks related to the current posterior asymmetric tether were still evident.
Materials and methods: Unilateral pedicle screws asymmetric tethering was performed to 14
female goats (age: 5–8 week-old, weight: 6–8 kg) in concave side in combination with convex rib
resection. Dorsoventral and lateral plain radiographs were taken of each thoracic spine in the
frontal and sagittal planes right after the surgery and later every 4 weeks.
Results: All animals ambulated freely after surgery. For technical reasons, 2 goats were excluded
(one animal died for anesthetic during the surgery, and one animal was lost for instrumental fail due
to postoperative infection). Radiography showed that 11 goats exhibited scoliosis with convex
toward to the right side, and as the curve increased with time, only 1 goat showed nonprogressive.
The initial scoliosis generated in the progressors after the procedures measured 29.0° on average
(range 23.0°–38.5°) and increased to 43.0° on average (range 36.0°–58.0°) over 8 to 10 weeks. The
average progression of 14.0° was measured. The curvature immediately after tethering surgery (the
initial Cobb angle) did have a highly significant correlation with the final curvature (p < 0.001). The
progressive goats showed an idiopathic-like deformity not only by radiography, but in general
appearance.
Conclusion: Unilateral pedicle screws asymmetric tethering is a practical method to create
experimental scoliosis, especially for those who would like to study the correction of this
deformity.

Introduction
Till today, the etiology of the scoliosis is still uncertain.
Many theories have been proposed to explain its occurrence, and many attempts have been made to establish a
suitable experimental model of scoliosis. People have
been interested in the animal models not only suitable to
investigate the pathogenesy and the development, but
also to study correction of scoliosis.
Various optional methods to create the animal model of
scoliosis can be found in the literature. MacEwen [1]
divided these methods into those using systemic agents
and those using localized surgical procedures on the musculoskeletal or nervous system. The former group
included aminonitriles[2], [beta]-aminopropionitrile[3].
Additionally, some mutagenic agents were administered
to pregnant animals [4,5] However, a prominent character
of those deformities induced by systemic agents is the
associate deformities of other organs, which is not similar
to the idiopathic scoliosis. Thus, these animal models are
not ideal for subsequent studies. In addition, most scholars prone to create experimental scoliosis using localized
surgical procedures.
Haas [6] and William Nachlas [7] created experimental
scoliosis by resection or compression of the epiphysis cartilaginous pate of the vertebra. Carpintero [8] performed
Localized surgical procedures on posterior spine to create
experimental scoliosis. While, Thomas S [9], Sevastik J et
al [10] and Sevastikoglou JA et al [11] succeeded in the
field by rib surgery (elong or shorten the rib), and, to
some extent, Barrios C [12], Olsen GA [13], and Joe T [14]
also succeeded by interrupting the nervous system or musculature selectively. Additionally, Machida [15-17] and
Wang XP [18] et al performed pinealectomy on the chick
and bipedal rat. There are many similarities in the development of scoliosis in young chickens after pinealectomy
and in children with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. This
method bring an experimental scoliosis model to study
the pathogenic mechanism, pathologic mechanism,
nature course of this phenomenon, and with the expectation of uncover the etiology of the AIS. However, it is well
recognized that there is a large phylogenetic gulf between
avian or beast and human.
Among these methods, only a few successes have been
achieved in large animal models. Braun JT [19-25], performed a posterior asymmetric rigid or flexible tethering
with convex rib resection and concave rib tethering on
immature goat. During the tethering period, majority of
these goats achieved a progressive, structural, lordoscoliotic curve of significant magnitude convex to the right in
the thoracic spine. However, as the author noted, despite
the close approximation of idiopathic scoliosis in these
animal models, several shortcomings related to the poste-

rior asymmetric tether were evident. There are some risks
such as neurological complications during the operation
procedures. It is not easy to insert or to remove the tether
as well.
As we know, pedicle screw, compared to the hook technology, offers less neurologic problems, and can be
implanted or removed easily. Pedicle screw was chosen to
take the place of the sublaminar hook as described by
Braun JT. The left side rib tethering was cancelled to minimally invasive the tissues surrounding the spine. To
reduce the elastic recover strength of the opposite side
(right side) of the thoracic skeleton, T7-12 rib resection
was needed.

Materials and methods
This study was performed according to the guidelines of
the animal experimental center at General Hospital of
Chinese PLA.
Surgery was performed on immature goats who were
anesthetized with 3%sodium pentobarbital. The anesthetic dose was about 30–40 milligram per kilogram, and
the route of administration was vein injection.
Operative technique
After the anesthetizing procedure and the skin preparation of the operative region, a posterior paramidline skin
incision from approximately T5 to L2 was used to gain
access for contralateral (left) cranial and caudal pedicle
screws implantation and ipsilateral (right) rib resection
(Fig 1). Blood vessel forceps was used to dissect the left
erector spinae to expose the transverse process for the
insertion of two pedicle screws at adjacent levels on left
side of the spine, proximally at the T6,7 and distally at
L1,2 (Fig 2). The anchor point of the thoracic vertebra was
located the intercross point of the midline of the transverse process and the vertical line through the highest
point. The anchor point of the lumbar vertebra was
located the intercross point of the midline of transverse
process and the lateral rim of the superior articular process. The angulations between the direction of T6, 7 pedicle
screws and the sagittal plane of spine (angle of crab) were
about 30°, while the counterparts of the L1, 2 were about
40°. It was not necessary to dissect amina extensively during this procedure. The pedicle screws served as proximal
and distal anchors for the tethering.

Subcutaneous latissimus dorsi was dissected in the right
thorax allowed for convex resection of 2 to 3 cm of T7-12
rib. The thirteenth rib, as costa fluctuantes, contributing
less to the stability of the spine, was not resected. The rib
resection was accomplished in a standard subperiosteal
manner without violating the underlying rib bed or
pleura.

contralateral cranial and caudal pedicle screws implantation
and ipsilateral rib resection.

A prebending stainless steel rod was then passed subcutaneously and submuscularly between the sets of pedicle
screws. Firstly, the rod was fixed with proximal two pedicle screws by setscrews, and the spine was subsequently
compressed to create a right thoracic scoliosis. The rod
was fixed on the distal screws aftermath. Figure 1 shows
the two incisions, at the cranial and caudal ends, where

Radiographic examination
Dorsoventral and lateral plain radiographs were taken of
each thoracic spine in the frontal and sagittal planes right
after the surgery and every 4 weeks after the operative procedures. Cobb angles were measured using radiographs.
The degrees of coronal and sagittal deformity and vertebral wedging were measured using standard Cobb angle
technique.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using t student test,
and the level of statistical significance was set to P < 0.05

Results
All 14 female goats were performed with unilateral pedicle screws asymmetric tethering in concave side in combination with convex rib resection (age: 5–8 week-old,
weight: 6–8 kg). All animals ambulated freely after surgery. For technical reasons, 2 goats were excluded. One

animal died for anesthetic during the surgery (overdose
sodium pentobarbital may slow down the respiratory frequency and the heart rate, the risk may increase when a
compressing strength was performed on the thoracic
cage), the other animal was lost for instrumental fail contributed by postoperative infection.
Dorsoventral and lateral plain radiographs demonstrate
scoliosis toward to the right side had been achieved after
the surgery (Fig. 3). The following series radiographic
examination found that 1 (8.3%) goat had nonprogressed
curve and that the curvature increased with time (Fig. 4).
The body weight of the nonprogressed animal did not
show significant increase during the tethering period,
indicating that the spines of the goats had no elongation
as well (Table 1).
The initial scoliosis created in the progressors after the
procedures measured 29.0° on average (range 23.0°–
38.5°) and increased to 43.0° on average (range 36.0°–
58.0°) over 8 to 10 weeks. The average progression was
14.0°. The curvature immediately after tethering surgery

(the initial Cobb angle) did have a highly significant correlation with the final curvature (p < 0.001).
Each goat with progressive curves showed a typical, posterior view idiopathic-type scoliosis with a right rib prominence and a left depressed thoracic cage (Fig. 5). The gaits
of these creeper animals exhibited imbalances of the
spines.

Normal spine growth requires a precise and delicate
mechanical balance of equilibrium and postural tone.
Disturbances in primary structures, supporting structures,
growth centers, position of the spine, and related neural
or muscular components, theoretically, could result in
scoliosis in the growing animals. Therefore, by properly
impacting on the balance of the spine, we can create the
unique three-dimensional deformity according to our
needs. Many methods had been tried to create progressive
scoliotic curves, only a few successes have been achieved
in large animal models. However, some shortcomings
related to the current posterior asymmetric tethering were
still evident.

The purpose of this study, as previously described, is to
refine a minimally invasive scoliosis model in an immature goat produced by mechanically modulation of the
spine, which could later be applied to human-sized technologies and devices. The ideal technique would result in
a fusionless spine with a reproducible Cobb angle which
would not violate the tissues surrounding the spine for
future corrective treatments [26].

Straightly speaking, the pedicle screw asymmetric tethering is not simply posterior tethering. It is because the compress strength has been extended to the anterolaterior
vertebral body though the procedure is performed
through posterior approach. There, the scoliosis is theoretically significant in this experimental model, while the
lordosis is relatively less. The data of this study has also
confirmed this hypothesis.

The development of corrective techniques for the spinal
curvature in animals has paved the way for experiments
on the production of such deformities. Compared to the
hook techniques, pedicle screw offers less neurologic
problems [27], and can be implanted or removed easily.
Therefore, pedicle screw was chosen to replace the sublaminar hook as described by Braun JT.

The experimental production of these curvatures are based
on the recognition of four facts: 1) that the pedicle screw
is strong and safe enough, 2) that epiphyseal growth can
be retarded by compression [28-31], 3) that the length of
the instrumental segment of the spine may increase during the tethering period, 4) that unequal elongation of the
two sides of the spine will result in spinal curvature.
Asymmetric tether provides an ideal growth condition of
imbalance, where the thoracic skeleton contributes a great
to maintain the dynamic balance of the spine [32]. It shall
be therefore taken into consideration during the mechanical modulation of the spinal growth. The elastic recover
strength of the opposite side (right side) of the thoracic
skeleton may reduce a lot if we the contralateral rib
resected. According to the Hueter-Volkmann principle,
the imbalance may increase accordingly and thus shorten
the tethering period.

prominence and a left depressed thoracic cage.

As the etiology of the scoliosis has not been fully understand, it is impossible to completely regenerate the special
deformity. The animal model created by this method is
therefore morphological rather than etiological. However,
the structural alterations of these experimental models are
similar to those of idiopathic deformity: scoliosis, rotation, hypokyphosis. By this mean, this method introduces
a convenient way to study the correction of the deformity.

The advantages of the method to create idiopathic
deformity are obvious: 1) without violating the spinal elements along the curve, 2) without extensive hemilaminotomy and sublaminar dissection, 3) easy to implant or to
remove the tether relatively. 4) less anatomic limitation.
The last aspect is the most significant as it is very practical
in creating animal scoliotic model, i.e. it is theoretically
possible to create all types of scoliotic model by implanting the pedicle screws selectively.
