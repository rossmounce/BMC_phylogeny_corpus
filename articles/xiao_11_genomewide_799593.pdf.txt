gametophyte development in Physcomitrella patens

Abstract
Background: Regulation of gene expression plays a pivotal role in controlling the development of multicellular
plants. To explore the molecular mechanism of plant developmental-stage transition and cell-fate determination, a
genome-wide analysis was undertaken of sequential developmental time-points and individual tissue types in the
model moss Physcomitrella patens because of the short life cycle and relative structural simplicity of this plant.
Results: Gene expression was analyzed by digital gene expression tag profiling of samples taken from P. patens
protonema at 3, 14 and 24 days, and from leafy shoot tissues at 30 days, after protoplast isolation, and from 14day-old caulonemal and chloronemal tissues. In total, 4333 genes were identified as differentially displayed. Among
these genes, 4129 were developmental-stage specific and 423 were preferentially expressed in either chloronemal
or caulonemal tissues. Most of the differentially displayed genes were assigned to functions in organic substance
and energy metabolism or macromolecule biosynthetic and catabolic processes based on gene ontology
descriptions. In addition, some regulatory genes identified as candidates might be involved in controlling the
developmental-stage transition and cell differentiation, namely MYB-like, HB-8, AL3, zinc finger family proteins,
bHLH superfamily, GATA superfamily, GATA and bZIP transcription factors, protein kinases, genes related to protein/
amino acid methylation, and auxin, ethylene, and cytokinin signaling pathways.
Conclusions: These genes that show highly dynamic changes in expression during development in P. patens are
potential targets for further functional characterization and evolutionary developmental biology studies.

Background
Most plants originate from a single-celled zygote [1]. To
achieve maturity, a plant must pass through different
developmental stages that comprise a series of cell division, cell expansion and cell differentiation processes.
Despite the practical difficulties, understanding the regulation of plant development is reasonably well advanced for
some processes, including lateral root formation, seed
development, and fruit development, and genes that regulate these processes have been identified [2-6]. However,
we are still far from fully understanding the molecular
mechanisms that govern development.
The increasing power of genomic tools enables the
changes in expression of thousands of genes to be profiled in parallel during sequential developmental stages.
Several high-throughput techniques can be used to study

expression of mRNAs, proteins, and metabolites [7].
Although the final activity of a particular gene is determined by the encoded protein, measurements of mRNA
levels have proven to be valuable for identification of the
molecular changes that occur in cells. Transcriptomic
analysis could also provide clues for construction of a
digital in situ hybridization map of the cellular systems
or cell-to-cell networks [8].
We chose to identify regulatory developmental genes
using the model bryophyte, Physcomitrella patens.
Although they diverged hundreds of millions of years
ago, bryophytes have similar fundamental genetic and
physiological features to those of seed plants [9]. Compared to vascular plants, bryophytes are argued to be an
ideal system to study developmental mechanisms because
of their accessible haploid stage and relatively simple
structure [10]. Among bryophytes, the moss Physcomitrella patens has emerged recently as the bryophyte
model of choice for several reasons, including its short
life cycle (about 3 months) [11] and efficient homologous

recombination [12]. Furthermore, P. patens is placed
phylogenetically between algae and seed plants [13].
Therefore, studies on this species might be of both developmental and evolutionary significance.
The life cycle of P. patens consists of two generations:
the haploid gametophyte generation followed by the
diploid sporophyte [13]. Gametophyte development is
further divided into two stages: a juvenile filamentous
stage, termed the protonema, and leafy adult stage, termed
the gametophore because each leafy stem is capable of
generating the sex organs [14,15]. The vegetative development of P. patens involves only a few cell types. In
P. patens, when the haploid spore germinates, or when a
protoplast derived from protonema tissue regenerates, a
single-celled filament forms with the apical cell dividing
and elongating by tip growth. Soon after the filament
forms, subapical cells divide obliquely and give rise to
branches, thereby forming a highly branched filamentous
network (protonema). Initially, the protonema has perpendicular cross walls and is filled with large, spherical chloroplasts; filaments comprising this type of cell are called
chloronema. Subsequently, a second filament type develops, often in response to light and auxin, called a caulonema [13]. Compared with chloronemal cells, caulonemal
cells are longer, divide more often, and contain fewer
chloroplasts, which are smaller and flattened. Finally, the
kind of branches produced changes from protonemal to
those that give rise to leafy gametophores [16]. While protonemata grow in a two-dimensional network, the leafy
gametophores grow upwards toward the light, thus forming a three-dimensional gametophyte.
Recently, the availability of a high-quality genomic
sequence for P. patens [9] has facilitated ‘-omic’ studies on
this organism. In this study, we used the digital gene
expression tag profiling (DGEP) strategy driven by highthroughput sequencing technology to profile the transcripts at different stages of P. patens gametophyte development and obtained spatiotemporal-specific gene
regulation models for growth and differentiation. Furthermore, we also compared mRNA profiles from chloronemal
and caulonemal tissues, isolated with laser-capture microdissection. These results provide a comprehensive catalogue of gene expression changes from which potentially
regulatory changes can be mined.

Results
Gametophytic morphogenesis during the culture of P.
patens protoplasts

Morphogenesis of moss gametophytes from protoplasts is
similar to morphological development following germination of spores, but the similarity in gene expression
level is unknown. This is in contrast to regeneration of
the sporophyte from seed plant protoplasts, a process
that proceeds through a callus phase and is often difficult

to achieve in the laboratory [17]. In the present study, for
P. patens a new cell wall was regenerated and a polar axis
was established within 2 days of generating protoplasts.
After 3 days of culture, chloronema containing two to
three cells were present (Figure 1A). By day 14, small
plants were present, containing both chloronema and
caulonema (Figure 1B). In day 14 plants, chloronemal
cells were about twice as numerous as caulonemal cells
(Table 1). Differentiation of cells into these two cell types
is supported by the significant differences in length and
chloroplast number per cell (Table 1). By 24 days after
protoplast formation, large numbers of buds had formed
from protonemal filaments, which represent initiation of
leafy shoots (Figure 1C). After one month, mature gametophores were present (Figure 1D).
To analyze the gene expression profiles during gametophyte development, we harvested gametophytes at 3,
14, 24, and 30 days after protoplast isolation. To avoid
circadian effects, harvesting was conducted at the same
time of day. Additionally, 14-day-old live protonemata
were used to obtain chloronemal and caulonemal tissues
by means of laser microdissection (Figure 1E-J). Each
tissue sample comprised mitotically active cells (apical
cells and subapical cells generating a side branch; ~20%)
and mitotically inactive cells (~80%).
Laser microdissection and RNA quality

To obtain reliable DGEP results, laser microdissection
must produce a sufficient amount of RNA of high integrity. Laser microdissection conditions were optimized for
the chloronemal and caulonemal cells of 14-day-old live
protonema. The power and duration of laser pulses, especially of the ultraviolet (UV) laser, affect RNA integrity
and are dependent on thickness of tissues. We tested the
UV laser settings by applying test pulses different intensity and duration. Finally, double the default UV capture
power was used. The laser cutting properties had the following parameters: spacing = 700, number of tabs = 2,
size = 2.
Of the conditions tested, UV cutting damage was
minimized. As shown in Table 2, three sets of chloronemal or caulonemal tissue, respectively, were obtained.
Each tissue type contained more than 10,000 cells and
each set yielded more than 500 ng RNA, corresponding
to >20 pg RNA per cell. In total, 2419 μg and 2555.5 μg
RNA were obtained from chloronemal and caulonemal
cell populations, respectively. RNA integrity numbers
were greater than 7.5.

Approximately 3.5 to 8.4 million 21-nt cDNA tags were
generated using the cDNA library derived from each
sample (Additional file 1). Distinct clean tags from each

empirical Bayes analysis to improve power in small sample sizes [19-21]. This accounts for biological and technical variation and has been implemented for tag-based
data sets where small numbers of replicates are tested
and standard errors disperse further from the mean at
low versus high levels of expression [20,22]. We identified 4333 differentially expressed genes during gametophyte development in P. patens with false discovery rate
(FDR) corrected P-values of less than 0.01 (Figure 2;
Additional files 3 and 4).
To ensure that meaningful changes were considered,
we applied stringent statistical criteria to select genes, as
described in the methods. A total of 4333 genes were
identified as differentially expressed by tag-based DGEP
(Figure 2). Of these genes, 4129 were differentially
expressed as a function of developmental stage (Additional file 4) and 423 were expressed differentially based
on tissue type (i.e., chloronemal tissue versus caulonemal
tissue) (Figure 3; Additional file 4). Among the former

4129 genes, 3240 genes were preferentially expressed at a
single developmental stage, 783 were expressed preferentially at two developmental stages, and 106 at more than
two stages (Figure 3B). Of the 423 genes differentially
expressed in the two cell types, 223 were preferentially
expressed in caulonemal cells (Figure 3A; Additional
file 4).
The top 15 significantly enriched gene ontology (GO)
terms for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (p < 0.01)
are listed in Additional file 5. From 3 days to 14 days, biological processes of enriched DEGs focused on generation
of precursor metabolites and energy, organic substance
metabolic processes, energy reserve metabolic processes,
regulation of photosynthesis light reaction, and regulation
of generation of precursor metabolites and energy. The
molecular functions of enriched DEGs were oxidoreductase activity (acting on the CH-CH group of donors, with
NAD or NADP as acceptor) and sugar transmembrane
transporter activity. However, the cellular components
were organellar large or small ribosomal subunit, protontransporting two-sector ATPase complex, and membrane.
During bud formation (14 days to 24 days), significant
enriched DEGs differed from those detected during protonema development. The biological processes mainly
focused on cellular component biogenesis at cellular level

and the photosynthetic electron transport chain, as well
as generation of precursor metabolites and energy. The
molecular functions were similar to those detected after
3 days to 14 days. However, the cellular components
were focused on the photosystem and chloroplast
envelope.
Other than the stages mentioned above, significant
enriched DEGs concentrated on generation of precursor
metabolites and energy, and functioned in acid-ammonia (or amide) ligase activity at the leafy shoot development stage (Additional file 5).
For tissue-specific DEGs, significant enriched GO
terms were mainly involved in processes of cell wall
component metabolism, modified amino acid metabolism, ATP biosynthesis and metabolism, and oxidationreduction, and functioned in transporter activities, such
as hydrogen ion, inorganic cation, and substrate-specific
transmembrane transport. These processes and molecular functions were mainly implemented in the protontransporting two-sector ATPase complex, intracellular
organelle, ribosomal subunit and plastids.

DGEP results, the transcriptional levels of five randomly

selected genes were measured by quantitative real-time
PCR (qRT-PCR), in comparison with two internal genes
that showed relatively stable expression levels (Additional files 6 and 7). In all cases, the trends of real-time
PCR-based expression profiles among these genes were
similar to those obtained by DGEP analysis (Figure 4).
Developmental stage-specific profiling in the P. patens
gametophyte

To elucidate the developmental stage-specific gene expression profiles, we further analyzed the expression patterns
of all differentially displayed genes, with the expression
level at 3 days taken as a common reference. Based on this
analysis, the 4129 differentially expressed genes were
grouped into six patterns using a K-means clustering algorithm (Figure 5; Additional file 8). Pattern 1 genes were
highly expressed at day 3 and decreased to lower levels at
subsequent stages of development; in contrast, expression
of pattern 4 genes was low throughout development until
day 30 when their expression rose. Expression of pattern 2
genes peaked at day 14, that of pattern 3 genes peaked at
day 24, and pattern 6 genes showed broad optimal expression that spanned from days 14 to 24.
After 3 days of development, cell walls had regenerated
and chloronema had formed (Figure 1A). Among the
annotated pattern 1 genes (i.e., those with maximal expression at day 3), most were related to material and energy
metabolism, and mainly participated in carbon fixation,
protein and amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and
starch and sucrose metabolism (Additional file 8). In addition, this group contained several genes related to transport and ion binding, such as the auxin polar transportrelated genes ABCB4 (Pp1s391_45V6.1|PACid:18056701)
and ABCB19 (Pp1s252_67V6.1|PACid:18037761). Pattern
1 also included several transcription factors and other regulatory genes. For example, this group included genes that
encode a putative MADA-box family member (PHE1,
Pp1s7_353V6.1|PACid:18040126), a WRKY transcription
factor (WRKY42, Pp1s158_166V6.1|PACid:18042126), a
cytokinin response factor (CRF2, Pp1s7_481V6.1|
PACid:18051877), two putative MYB family members
(Pp1s66_90V6.1|PACid:18038312; Pp1s2_312V6.1|
PACid:18052823), a bZIP family member (BZO2H3,
Pp1s213_13V6.2|PACid:18049359) and a homologue of a
gene involved in chromatin remodeling (CHR4,
Pp1s223_99V6.1|PACid:18036570). Moreover, several protein kinase-related genes were also preferentially
expressed. Finally, pattern 1 genes included a few putative
stress-responsive genes, such as heat shock protein 70
members, peroxidase/catalase superfamily members, and a
putative gene encoding a CDC48 protein (CDC48,
Pp1s296_11V6.2|PACid:18068409). However, it is not
clear whether or not expression of these stress-responsive
genes reflects the inherent developmental program.

Pattern 2 genes were expressed maximally at 14 days,
which represented an early stage of gametophyte development with vigorous growth (Figure 1B). Not surprisingly,
compared to day 3, genes involved in ribosomal protein
synthesis installation represent a major proportion of the
total, which mainly functions in plastids (Additional file 8).
Genes related to cell wall biosynthesis, light capture and
carbon assimilation continued to represent a major component. With regard to regulatory proteins, genes encoding a calmodulin showed significant expression changes
(CAM5, Pp1s40_127V6.1|PACid:18070060). Moreover, a
putative gene involved in histone lysine methylation
(ATX1, Pp1s67_56V6.1|PACid: 18050867) also showed
peak expression.
Genes in pattern 3 were expressed maximally at day 24,
a stage in which the leafy shoot initials form and which
represents the transition from the two-dimensional protonemal network to the three-dimensional adult gametophyte (Figure 1C). At this stage, although genes involved
in material and energy metabolism were still the most
abundant classes, their dominance decreased and the
representation of genes among all other categories
increased, including a few putative transcription factors
(SHP1, Pp1s267_56V6.1|PACid:18072078; HB-8,
Pp1s188_95V6.1|PACid:18072307; GATA19, Pp1s121_
36V6.1|PACid:18055435; HY5, Pp1s80_72V6.1|PACid:
18053259), protein kinase (BAM2, Pp1s59_314V6.1|
PACid:18060049; SK13, Pp1s52_55V6.1|PACid:18074399;
VIK, Pp1s136_112V6.1|PACid:18036754) and methyltransferase categories (ACL5, Pp1s41_50V6.2|PACid:
18058199; STE14B, Pp1s112_210V6.2|PACid:18064877)
(Additional file 8). Interestingly, one of the pattern 3 genes
was a putative transcription factor HB-8, a putative homologue of which has been characterized in Arabidopsis and
is involved in the differentiation of preprocambial cells
into xylem during leaf vein formation [23]. Because bryophytes lack a vascular cambium, these results suggest that
this transcription factor originally had a role in the development and the evolution of a pervasive multicellular
plant body.
Genes in pattern 4 were specifically expressed at the
adult leafy shoot stage (Figure 1D). At this stage, the proportion of metabolic genes increased to almost half and
the proportion of protein synthesis genes decreased to a
similar level to that of all other categories (Additional file
8). Approximately 40 members of several transcription
factor families significantly increased in transcript level,
such as members from the zinc finger, bHLH, MYB, BAH,
bZIP, CHASE and PLATE superfamilies. More than 20
protein kinase-encoding genes were also preferentially
expressed. Interesting regulatory genes in this group
included those encoding a putative ethylene response gene
(ETR1/EIN1, Pp1s115_107V6.1|PACid:18060143) a putative thylene insensitive 3 (EIN3, Pp1s11_337V6.1|

Candidate genes involved in protonema differentiation

Vegetative development of P. patens involved only a few
cell types. In our experimental conditions, a protonema
initially comprised only chloronemal cells within the
first 10 days. Subsequently, the chloronemal tip cells
began to change, ultimately differentiating into caulonemal cells. By day 14, the protonemal colony included
well-developed chloronema and caulonema (Figure 1B).
To understand the molecular basis that leads to the differences between the two cell types, we isolated the two

Discussion

specific plant cells [26-29]. Typical laser capture microdissection is used on sectioned material, but the twodimensional nature of the protonemal growth habit of
P. patens allowed us to capture cells from living material,
thereby minimizing undesirable changes in gene expression during sample preparation. Because of the difficulty
of obtaining more than 10,000 apical or subapical cells of
chloronemal and caulonemal tissues, we captured chloronemal and caulonemal samples that contained both mitotically active cells and mitotically inactive cells for DGEP
analysis.
DGEP is conducted on a Genome Analyzer 2x system
using an eight-lane flow cell, which can generate 90 to 100
million reads per run (http://www.Illumina.com). In the
present study, we successfully profiled chloronemal and
caulonemal gene expression in P. patens by combined
laser-capture microdissection and DGEP. The results
demonstrated LCM-mediated DGEP analyses can be used
to conduct global profiling of gene expression on individual tissues captured from live plants. We report here
LCM-based methods to isolate chloronemal and caulonemal tissues from live protonema free of detectable contamination with intact non-target cells in P. patens (Figure
1). This is the first report of application of an LCM-based
method to capture individual tissues from live plants. In
this study, 358 genes were preferentially expressed in
chloronemal or caulonemal tissue. Our data provide
important clues for elucidation of the molecular mechanism of cell differentiation and provide a useful baseline for
future digital gene expression mapping.

cell types by laser-capture microdissection and used
DGEP to profile gene expression. In total, we identified
423 DEGs (Figure 3A). Of these, 200 DEGs were preferentially expressed in chloronemal cells and 223 in caulonemal cells.
Of those genes preferentially expressed in chloronemal
tissue, the majority functioned in metabolism and protein
synthesis (Additional file 4). Additionally, a putative zinc
finger (DNL type) transcription factor and three protein
modification-related genes were specifically expressed.
Among the 223 genes preferentially expressed in chloronemal tissue, significantly enriched genes functioned in
ion binding, protein binding, RNA binding and structural
molecule actchloronemaity (Additional files 4 and 5).
Compared with caulonemal tissue, genes preferentially
expressed in chloronemal tissue represented four major
categories: organic substance and energy metabolism
(especially photosynthesis), protein synthesis and proteolysis, transport, and cell wall synthesis and signaling pathways (Additional files 4 and 5). Genes related to several
transcription factors in the two tissues (ABI3, Pp1s173_

chloronemal and caulonemal tissues and were chosen as
candidates for discussion and future study.

Plant development reflects both endogenous genetic programs and responses to exogenous events [7]. Analyses
of global gene expression can reveal much about how
genes function and how their products interact during
development. Most previous gene expression analyses
sampled whole organs or tissues [7]. Although these studies have provided valuable information, they are limited
by the composite nature of plant organs, which consist of
multiple tissues. We expect each cell type to have a
unique transcriptome [24]. A transcriptomic analysis of a
complete organ provides gene expression information
integrated over all cell types, and is thus not particularly
informative about cellular differentiation.
Technical advances have made it possible to study global patterns of gene expression in an individual tissue,
which increases the information revealed by expression
profiling. A transcriptome from a single tissue can now
be obtained by using laser-capture microdissection, an
approach whereby a cell is physically isolated from the
surrounding tissue [25]. Several research groups have
used laser-capture microdissection successfully to isolate

At day 3, half of the preferentially expressed genes (i.e.,
pattern 1 genes) functioned in metabolism (Additional
files 4 and 5), most of which were involved in the citrate
cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, and metabolism of
pyruvate, starch, and sucrose. Although earlier stages
were not sampled, these findings suggest the regeneration
process requires considerable metabolic reprogramming.
It would be interesting to determine whether a similar
pattern emerged in the first few days following spore
germination.
In our culture conditions, protonema containing two
cell types emerged between days 3 to 14 (Figure 1). Not
surprisingly, transcripts encoding genes involved in photosynthesis and protein synthesis represented the bulk of the
genes preferentially expressed at day 14. Between days 14
and 24, the plants transition from a two-dimensional protonemal network to three-dimensional structure containing leafy shoots, although by day 24 the leafy shoots were
mostly still buds. Along with this development, many new
metabolism-related genes were expressed, which implied

Xiao et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:177
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/177

distinct metabolic pathways operate during this phase of
gametophyte development.
By day 30, a mature three-dimensional gametophyte
consisting of leafy shoots and rhizoids was attained. Interestingly, at this stage, a gene encoding a homologue of
thale cress ROOTHAIR DEFECTIVE 3 (RHD3, Pp1s33_
217V6.1|PACid:18056995) was preferentially expressed. In
Arabidopsis, RHD3 encodes an evolutionarily conserved
protein with GTP-binding motifs that is required for
expansion of both roots and root hairs, and is implicated
in the control of vesicle trafficking between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi compartments [30,31].
A previous study by Menand et al. [32] suggested ROOT
HAIR DEFECTIVE 6 (RHD6), a homologue of RHD3, controls root hair development in Arabidopsis and rhizoid
development in P. patens. This result supports the hypothesis that early land plants were bryophyte-like and possessed a dominant gametophyte, and that later the
sporophytes rose to dominance. Furthermore, this finding
suggests the increase in morphological complexity of the
sporophyte body in the Paleozoic resulted at least in part
from the recruitment of regulatory genes from gametophyte to sporophyte.
Comparison of the two protonemal cell types showed a
number of genes related to protein synthetic installation,
cell wall metabolism, photosynthesis and transport were
specifically expressed in chloronema. This cell type forms
initially and the more vigorous caulonema differentiate
subsequently. The expression pattern of chloronema
might indicate the primary function of these cells is to
give rise to the caulonemal cells and it is the latter that
take on diverse physiological functions and lead to the
continued development of the gametophyte; in addition,
accumulation of transcript products in chloronemal cells
might contribute material and energy for caulonemal cell
differentiation.
Cell division genes

The gametophyte progresses from two or three cells at day
3 to tens of thousands of cells by day 30. Not surprisingly,
many genes related to control of cell division were differentially expressed, among which were the following genes.
Proteolysis is considered to be important steps in
ensuring unidirectional progression of the cell cycle by
triggering rapid degradation of target proteins that in
turn drive the cycle forward [33]. The SCF complex, consisting of SKP1, Cullin, and F-box, could associate with
E3 ligase and help to recruit and degrade the target proteins during the G1-S transition of the cell cycle [34]. In
the present study, genes encoding SKP1, Cullin 1 and
Cullin 4 were preferentially expressed after 30 days,
which suggests a role for the SCF complex pathway in
the regulation of cell division in leafy shoots during
gametophyte development in P. patens. The auxin

Page 10 of 16

response also depended on regulation of the SCF E3-ubiquitin-protein complex [35]; consequently, increased
SKP1 transcription might promote an endogenous auxin
response and activate the cell division cycle.
Expression of genes related to hormone signaling during
gametophyte development

Hormones regulate plant development by a complex signal response network. Similar to higher plants, growth
and development in P. patens is regulated both by environmental factors and phytohormones [36,37]. Genes
involved in the signaling pathway of three major plant
hormones, namely auxin, ethylene and cytokinins, are
discussed in this section. In the present study, eight preferential DEGs involved in the auxin signaling pathway
were expressed from days 3 to 30 (Additional file 8). Of
these, two genes that belong to the family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, ABCB4 and ABCB19,
were preferentially expressed at day 3. In thale cress, the
ABCB4 and ABCB19 proteins were required for polar
transport of auxin (indole-3-acetic acid) [38,39]. In addition, the ABCB19 protein possibly regulated auxindependent responses by influencing basipetal auxin
transport in the root and influenced the auxin transport
process that acts through cry1 or phyB to control hypocotyl growth during de-etiolation in seedlings [40]. Auxin
transport is mediated at the cellular level by three independent mechanisms that are characterized by the PINformed (PIN), P-glycoprotein (ABCB/PGP), and AUX/
LAX transport proteins [41]. PIN and ABCB transport
proteins, which are best represented by PIN1 and
ABCB19 (PGP19), coordinately regulate auxin efflux.
When PIN1 and ABCB19 coincide on the plasma membrane, their interaction enhances the rate and specificity
of auxin efflux, and the dynamic cycling of PIN1 is
reduced. This finding suggests ABCB19 stabilizes PIN1
localization at the plasma membrane in discrete cellular
subdomains where PIN1 and ABCB19 expression overlaps [41,42].
Another important auxin response gene was auxin
response factor 6 (ARF6), of which one copy (Pp1s133_
56V6.1|PACid:18061618) showed maximal expression at
day 30 (Additional file 8). The other copy (Pp1s316_
22V6.1|PACid:18051030) showed peak expression in caulonema (Additional file 5). The ART6 gene, as a positive
regulator, is involved in the crosstalk of auxin and light
signaling pathways and auxin homeostasis and controls
adventitious root initiation in Arabidopsis [43]. A previous
study suggests auxin promotes the development of caulonema cells in P. patens [44]. Our results demonstrate
auxin promotes growth and differentiation of caulonema
and three-dimensional leafy shoots.
Ethylene is a plant hormone that regulates many processes, such as seed germination, root hair development,

Xiao et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:177
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/177

fruit ripening and stress responses, in higher plants [45].
According to the model elaborated for Arabidopsis [46],
ethylene is perceived by specific receptors that act as
negative regulators of the ethylene response. Five ethylene receptors, i.e., ETR1/EIN1, ERS1, EIN4, ETR2, and
ERS2, are present in thale cress and dominant negative
mutants of each that confer ethylene insensitivity are
reported [47]. The P. patens genome codes for six putative ETR-like ethylene receptors and two putative 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) synthases as well as
two transcription factors, although there is no clear evidence that P. patens responds to ethylene [9]. We found
a putative ethylene receptor (ETR1/EIN1) was preferentially expressed at day 30 and a putative ethylene insensitive gene (EIN3) accumulated at day 30. In Arabidopis,
EIN3 functions as a nuclear transcription factor that
initiates downstream transcriptional cascades for ethylene
responses, including seedling de-etiolation, modulation of
nitric oxide-related iron acquisition and homeostasis, and
plant innate immunity [48-51]. Therefore, we speculate
the ethylene signaling pathway might also play a role during P. patens gametophyte development.
Some reports suggest cytokinins are also important phytohormones involved in P. patens development, which can
induce bud formation in mosses in a concentration-dependent manner [52]. In the present study only two genes
involved in the cytokinin signaling pathway were identified. A putative cytokinin response factor 2 (CRF2) and a
putative CHASE domain-containing histidine kinase protein (WOL) showed maximal expression at day 3 and day
30, respectively (Additional file 8). These data provide
clues to the molecular mechanism of developmental processes regulated by phytohormones in P. patens.
Transcription factors

During protoplast regeneration into a gametophyte, more
than 80 transcription factors show changed expression
levels (Additional file 4). Among the differentially
expressed transcription factors, several were preferentially
expressed at day 3 (Additional file 8). One of these
encodes a putative BZO2H3 homologue, which belongs to
the bZIP transcription factor family. Recently, BZO2H3
was reported to be a sensitive integrator of transient abscisic acid and glucose signals in Arabidopsis [53]. Another
differentially expressed transcription factor is WRKY42, a
putative homologue of the WRKY transcription factor
family (Group II-b) in Arabidopsis. The WRKY proteins
are a superfamily of transcription factors with up to 100
representatives in Arabidopsis. Family members appear to
be involved in the regulation of a variety of physiological
processes unique to plants, including pathogen defense,
senescence and trichome development [54]. We suggest,
therefore, that these two transcription factors play a role
in protoplast regeneration.

Page 11 of 16

One transcription factor that showed peak expression
on day 24 is a putative homologue of class III homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP III) transcription factors,
HB-8. In thale cress, HB-8 binds to the promoters of
genes predominantly expressed in vascular tissues [55],
and acts as a transcription factor in vascular meristems
to promote proliferation of procambial cells and suppress their differentiation into vascular cells [23]. Promoting proliferation while suppressing differentiation
might be necessary to form the leafy gametophyte shoot
on a physiologically appropriate time scale.
At day 30, one of the preferentially expressed transcription factors was a member of the GRF gene family,
which comprises nine members including growth-regulating factor 2 (GRF2; Additional file 8). In Arabidopsis,
overexpression of AtGRF1 and AtGRF2 resulted in larger leaves and cotyledons, as well as in delayed bolting
of the inflorescence stem when compared to wild-type
plants [56]. It is possible that these transcription factors
play similar roles in P. patens.
Epigenetic modification and gametophyte development

Protein methylation is one type of post-translational modification. Histones that are methylated on certain residues
can act epigenetically to repress or activate gene expression [57,58]. In the plant kingdom, protein methylation
plays a fundamental role in the regulation of diverse developmental processes [59]. In the present study, two putative
protein methylation-associated genes showed differential
expression during protoplast regeneration into a gametophyte (Additional file 8). Of these genes, STE14B was preferentially expressed at day 24 and encodes a putative
homologue of the isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase family, which is involved in post-translational processing of proteins with a C-terminal CaaX box [60]. A
putative VIP3 homologue exhibited maximal expression at
day 30. This gene is predicted to encode a transducin/
WD40 repeat-like superfamily protein with a DWD motif,
which is involved in protein complex formation. In Arabidopsis, this gene is involved in the timing of flowering and
flower development. Loss-of-function of this gene leads to
a redistribution of H3K4me3 and K3K36me2 modifications within genes but not a change in the overall abundance of these modifications within chromatin [61,62].
These expression results suggest epigenetic modification
of proteins play important roles during gametophyte
development in P. patens. Further research is still needed
to uncover the molecular mechanisms that control gametophyte development.

Conclusions
We analyzed the transcriptome during the transition
between sequential developmental stages, and as cells
differentiate, during gametophyte development of

Xiao et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:177
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/177

P. patens. The transcript levels of 4333 genes were significantly increased or reduced, of which the majority
changed only during a specific developmental stage or
in an individual tissue type. Our results provide an
extensive catalogue of regulatory factors and related
genes involved in cell division, growth, and differentiation during gametophyte development in P. patens.
Potential applications of these data include identification
of candidate genes for evolutionary developmental studies, as targets for reverse genetic studies of plant development, and as tools for cell-by-cell mapping of genes
involved in plant development.

Methods
Protoplast isolation and culture

Protonemal tissues of Physcomitrella patens subsp. patens
were subcultured at weekly intervals on the surface of cellophane that overlayed solid BCD medium containing
5 mM ammonium tartrate and 1% glucose (BCDAG) [63].
Protoplasts were isolated from protonemata according to a
modified protocol of Rother et al. [64]. Ten Petri dishes of
six-day-old protonemal tissues were collected and placed
in 10 mL of 0.5% driselase (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen,
Germany) in 8% (w/v) mannitol. After 30 min agitation in
the dark, the cells were passed successively through sieves
with a mesh size of 100 μm and 50 μm. The protoplast
suspension was allowed to stand for 15 min, and then was
centrifuged for 5 min at 600 rpm. The pellets were washed
with 8% mannitol and the number of protoplasts was
counted in a hemocytometer after a second centrifugation.
The freshly isolated protoplasts were transferred to 9 cm
Petri dishes containing BCDAG medium and cultured in
the dark for 24 hours at 25 ± 1°C. The cultures were incubated under light intensity of 55 μmol m-2 s-1 under a 16/
8 hour (light/dark) photoperiod at a constant temperature
(25°C).
Laser-capture microdissection

Cell type-specific gene expression profiling was performed
on 14-day-old protonema using a laser-capture microdissection system (ArcturusXT, Arcturus, Mountain View,
CA, USA) to isolate chloronemal and caulonemal cells
separately. Live protonema was placed on the ‘flat’ side of
the framed membrane slide coated with poly-L-lysine, and
mounted on a regular glass slide. Immediately thereafter,
cells were isolated according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (http://www.bmbio.com/file/201734.pdf).
Each slide was handled for less than 30 min to ensure cell
viability. Cell sets of more than 10,000 cells of each cell
type were captured and used for RNA isolation.
Total RNA preparation and quality control

To generate developmental stage-specific mRNA expression profiles, total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent

Page 12 of 16

(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) from 100 mg samples,
including 3 day to 30 day. RNase-free DNase (RQ1; Promega Corporation, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) was used
to remove genomic DNA. RNA from microdissected
chloronemal or caulonemal tissues was extracted from
the cells on the CapSure Macro LCM Cap (CapSure
Macro; Arcturus) using the PicoPure RNA Isolation Kit
(Arcturus) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The
CapSure Macro LCM Cap with captured cells was
inserted onto a microcentrifuge tube (Applied BioSystems) containing 50 μL extraction buffer. After incubation for 30 min at 42°C, the assembly was centrifuged at
800 × g for 2 min to collect the cell extract in the microcentrifuge tube. RNA purification was conducted using
the RNA purification column with conditioning buffer
and 70% ethanol. The RNA was washed with elution
buffer.
The yield of RNA was determined by measuring the
absorption at 260 nm with a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Marietta,
OH, USA). Integrity of the RNA was evaluated on an
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, using an RNA 6000 LabChip
kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Only RNA
with RNA integrity numbers greater than 7.5 were used
for DGEP and qRT-PCR analysis. For each tissue type
and sampling time-point, three biological replicates were
combined for DGEP or separated for further expression
analysis by qRT-PCR.
Digital gene expression tag profiling and data analysis

To obtain gene expression profiles, sequencing libraries
containing 21-nt tags were prepared from 6 μg total RNA
(for developmental stage-specific expression profiles) or 2
μg total RNA (for cell type-specific expression profiles)
using the Illumina Gene Expression Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Oligo (dT) magnetic beads
were used to adsorb and purify mRNA, and then to guide
reverse transcription to synthesize double-stranded cDNA.
While on the beads, double-stranded cDNA was digested
with an anchoring restriction endonuclease NlaIII that
recognizes and cuts off the CATG sites on the cDNA, and
ligates to an Illumina-specific adapter A. The junction of
the Illumina adapter A and CATG site is the recognition
site of MmeI, which cuts the cDNA at 17 bp downstream
of the CATG site.
Following MmeI digestion and dephosphorylation with
shrimp alkaline phosphatase (USB Corporation), the
cDNAs were purified and a second Illumina adapter B
was introduced at the 3’ end of the tags, which generated
tags with different adapters at both ends to form tag
libraries. After 15 cycles of linear PCR amplification, 85
base strips were purified by 6% TBE PAGE electrophoresis. The DNA quality was assessed and quantified using
an Agilent DNA 1000 series II assay (Agilent) and the

Xiao et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:177
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/177

DNA sample was diluted to 10 nM. The strips were then
denatured, and the single-chain molecules were fixed
onto the Solexa Sequencing Chip (flowcell). Cluster generation and sequencing was performed on the Illumina
cluster station and Genome Analyzer system (Illumina,
version 1.0) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Each tunnel generated millions of raw reads with a
sequence length of 35 bp (target tags plus 3’ adaptor).
Each molecule in the library represented a single tag
derived from a single transcript.
Raw sequences were extracted from the resulting image
files using the open source Firecrest and Bustard applications (Illumina). Raw reads were transformed into clean
tags by filtering out adaptor-only tags, low-quality tags
(containing ambiguous bases), tags that were too long
(>21 nt) or too short (<21 nt), and those present in a single copy only and hence assumed to represent sequencing
errors. Using blastn searches, comparison of the sequences
was carried out using the JGI Physcomitrella patens genome database (ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/JGI_data/phytozome/v7.0/Ppatens/annotation/) and National Center for
Biotechnological Information databases [65]. All clean tags
were mapped to P. patens reference sequences. For conservative and precise annotation, only sequences with a
perfect match or 1-nt mismatch were considered further.
Clean tags mapped to reference sequences from multiple
genes were filtered. The remainder of the clean tags were
designed as distinct clean tags. The number of distinct
clean tags for each gene was calculated and then normalized to the number of transcripts per million clean tags
(which is a standardized indicator of the transcript copies
in every 1 million clean tags) [66,67]. The saturation analysis was performed to check whether the number of
detected genes continues to increase when the sequencing
amount (total tag number) increases. Sequences were
manually assigned to functional categories based on the
analysis of scientific literature.
Only a small portion of the P. patens genome has been
studied. Therefore, for those genes whose functions could
not be inferred from the P. patens genome, a homology
search in The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR)
10 database (http://www.arabidopsis.org/) was conducted
and the annotation of homologues in A. thaliana was
used.
A rigorous algorithm to identify differentially expressed
genes between two samples was developed for significance
testing [68]. The P-value corresponds to the differential
gene expression test. The FDR was applied to determine
the threshold P-value in multiple tests through manipulation of the FDR value [69].
The number of tags mapped to a given gene was considered to represent the expression level of this gene. Expression levels of a gene from two distinct samples were
compared to give an expression difference. We classified

Page 13 of 16

the gene as differentially expressed only when the expression difference was more than two-fold with P-value <
0.01 and FDR < 0.001.
To determine the main biological functions, DEGs were
mapped to every node of the Gene Ontology (GO) database (http://www.geneontology.org/) and the gene number
of each node was calculated with GenMAPP v2.1, a program designed to perform a global analysis of gene expression or genomic data in the context of hundreds of
pathway MAPPs and thousands of GO terms (http://www.
genmapp.org/download_v2.1.php). GO enrichment analysis of functional significance terms in the GO database
was applied (Fisher’s test, p < 0.01) to map all DEGs to
terms in the GO database, looking for significantly
enriched GO terms in DEGs compared to the genome
background. For cluster analysis of DEGs at different
developmental stages, the comparison between two consecutive time-points was transformed into a comparison
using the day 3 time-point as a common reference point.
The K-means algorithm was used to produce groups of
DEGs using the Calculated Means mode with Euclidean
distance based on log fold-change data.
Significance testing

To compare gene expression profiles between two sequential time-point samples, the edgeR package (http://www.
bioconductor.org/packages/2.3/bioc/html/edgeR.html) was
used to adjust for differences in library size and therefore
raw read counts per gene (or per tag) were directly used as
input. We used a moderated, gene-wise dispersion analysis
for all four sample’s data sets separately with a weighted
parameter (prior.n) of 100. Because our data lacked a biological replication, we applied more than 100 tags for each
gene as a cut-off, in order to increase the reliability of the
results. The significance threshold for differential expression was p < 0.01 after correction using a Benjamini Hochberg FDR of 0.01.
Quantitative real-time PCR

For each sample, cDNAs were synthesized from 2 μg
total RNA (developmental stage-specific expression profile) or 0.5 μg total RNA (cell type-specific expression
profile) using the Invitrogen Reverse Transcription
Reagents Kit. Gene-specific primers were designed and
assessed with commercial software (Primer 5 and Oligo
6, respectively; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA)
and synthesized by Shanghai Sangon Technical Services
(Shanghai, China). Primers used in the qRT-PCR analysis
are listed in Additional file 6. The qRT-PCR reactions
were performed using a Corbett Research Rotor-Gene
3000 under the following conditions: 94°C for 5 min (one
cycle); 94°C for 20 s, 50°C to 60°C for 20 s, and 72°C for
20 s (50 cycles). Transcript abundance was identified
using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (TaKaRa Bio,

Xiao et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:177
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/177

Japan). Each reaction contained 1 μM mix buffer, 0.2 μM
each primer, and about 2 ng cDNA in a final volume of
25 μL. Three sample replicates were employed for each
sample and a template-free negative control was performed. Data were normalized relative to Pp1s40_
169V6.1 or Pp1s17_377V6.1, which exhibited relatively
stable expression levels in all day-3 to day-30 samples
and in chloronema and caulonema samples (Additional
file 7). Melting curves were performed on the product to
test if only a single product was amplified without primer
dimers and other bands. The products with all primer
combinations were visualized in a 2% agarose gel to confirm the generation of a single product of the correct
size. Relative quantitative analysis was performed using
comparative quantitation by Rotor-Gene Real-Time
Analysis 6.1 software.
