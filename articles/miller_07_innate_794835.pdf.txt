Conclusion: Consideration of these patterns of gene distribution underscores the likely
significance of gene loss during animal evolution whilst indicating ancient origins for many
components of the vertebrate innate immune system.

Results: To better understand the basis of innate immunity in cnidarians, we scanned the available
EST and genomic resources for some of the key components of the vertebrate innate immune
repertoire, focusing on the Toll/Toll-like receptor (TLR) and complement pathways. A canonical
Toll/TLR pathway is present in representatives of the basal cnidarian class Anthozoa, but neither a
classic Toll/TLR receptor nor a conventional nuclear factor (NF)-κB could be identified in the
anthozoan Hydra. Moreover, the detection of complement C3 and several membrane attack
complex/perforin domain (MAC/PF) proteins suggests that a prototypic complement effector
pathway may exist in anthozoans, but not in hydrozoans. Together with data for several other gene
families, this implies that Hydra may have undergone substantial secondary gene loss during
evolution. Such losses are not confined to Hydra, however, and at least one MAC/PF gene appears
to have been lost from Nematostella.

Background: Characterization of the innate immune repertoire of extant cnidarians is of both
fundamental and applied interest - it not only provides insights into the basic immunological 'tool
kit' of the common ancestor of all animals, but is also likely to be important in understanding the
global decline of coral reefs that is presently occurring. Recently, whole genome sequences became
available for two cnidarians, Hydra magnipapillata and Nematostella vectensis, and large expressed
sequence tag (EST) datasets are available for these and for the coral Acropora millepora.

Background

The innate immune system is the first line of defense against
pathogens, and in non-chordates is assumed to be the sole
means by which any non-self cells are detected and either
killed or contained [1]. Innate immunity in vertebrates is
essentially a two-tier system consisting on one hand of phagocyte activation by the interaction of specialized surface receptors with pathogens or pathogen-derived components, and on
the other of the direct opsonization and lysis of pathogens via
the complement cascade. Whilst the vertebrate innate
immune system has been the subject of intense investigation
and is relatively well understood, studies of invertebrate
immunity, which have focused primarily on the arthropods
Drosophila and various horseshoe crab species [2-4], have
revealed some striking similarities. For example, in both Drosophila and vertebrates, the Toll/Toll-like receptor (TLR)
mediates the activation of appropriate response genes to
microbial challenge [5,6].
Toll and the TLRs are transmembrane proteins with a characteristic domain structure consisting of an extracellular
amino-terminal domain containing leucine-rich repeats
(LRRs) responsible for pattern recognition and an intracellular Toll interleukin receptor (TIR) domain that mediates signal transmission. Although the Toll and TLR families of
arthropods and mammals are thought to have independently
diversified [7,8], all Tolls and TLRs signal via a common pathway that is conserved between Drosophila and mammals.
The ultimate step in this pathway is translocation of nuclear
factor (NF)-κB or its fly counterpart (the Dif/Rel heterodimer) into the nucleus, where it stimulates transcription
of appropriate response genes. The immune repertoire of the
horseshoe crab Carcinoscorpius includes a complex complement pathway that has both opsonic and lytic effector functions [9]. Horseshoe crab complement C3 is functionally
homologous with mammalian C3, mediating phagocytosis of
bacteria (by hemocytes) in a strikingly similar manner.
Whilst these specific studies imply that at least some innate
immune mechanisms have been conserved, broader comparative studies highlight the extent of gene loss and divergence
in various metazoan lineages. For example, although Carcinoscorpius clearly uses a vertebrate-like complement system,
none of the central components of the cascade (C2, C3, C4,
C5) are encoded by the genomes of the ecdysozoans Drosophila, Caenorhabditis or Anopheles. Moreover, the sole
Toll/TLR in Caenorhabditis elegans and C. brigssae is not
known to function in the context of immunity, nor does that
reported in the horseshoe crab Tachypleus tridentatus [10].
There are also important differences between the Toll/TLR
systems of Drosophila and mammals. For example, some
mammalian TLRs themselves act as pattern recognition
receptors (PRRs) upon microbial challenge, whereas in fly
this is not the case [11]. Moreover, whereas most of the ten or
so vertebrate TLRs function primarily in immunity, only one
of the nine fly (and ten mosquito) Tolls functions in this con-

text. The others play a role in development [10], most
famously in controlling differentiation in the dorsal/ventral
axis.
The significance of gene loss in animal evolution has recently
been brought into focus by preliminary expressed sequence
tag (EST) and genomic analyses of some 'basal' animals (Figure 1), particularly the anthozoan cnidarians Acropora millepora and Nematostella vectensis [12,13] and the planarian
Dugesia japonica [14]. Paradoxically, the genomes of these
morphologically simple animals contain many genes previously thought to have evolved much later in the context of vertebrate complexity, and most of the complexity of signaling
pathways and transcription factors associated with higher
animals is represented in the anthozoan datasets [13,15-17].
In contrast to Drosophila and Caenorhabditis, which have
undergone substantial gene loss, for at least some groups of
genes Acropora and Nematostella appear to have preserved
much of the genetic complexity of the common metazoan
ancestor. For example, whereas fly and worm have each lost
approximately half of the ancestral Wnt complement, all but
one of the 12 known Wnt subfamilies is represented in Nematostella [15]. The emerging cnidarian EST and genomic datasets are, therefore, potentially highly informative with respect
to the ancestral immunological repertoire. In addition to this
basic evolutionary significance, understanding the bases of
cnidarian immunity is of major applied significance in light of
the dramatic decline in coral health that has occurred on a
global scale over the past 20 years. Increasing human activity
in coastal zones throughout the world has led to declines in
water quality with increased sediment, nutrient and heavy
metal concentrations. These have all had detrimental effects
on corals with an associated increase in the prevalence of disease, and perhaps led to some new diseases, although this is
less certain, as coral diseases are very poorly understood.
Most are named for their symptoms, for example, 'white band
disease', 'black band disease', and 'rapid wasting syndrome'
and causative agents are frequently unknown. In the face of
this uncertainty it is important that coral defense mechanisms should be better understood.
Although cnidarians have no specialized immune cells, at
least some display highly specific allorecognition characteristics. Allorecognition, xenorecognition, and killing mechanisms have been demonstrated in several hydrozoans [18-20]
and anthozoans [21-23]. Allorecognition is thought to protect
colonial cnidarians from fusion with genetically different
individuals and to prevent germ line parasitism. The effector
mechanisms range from contact avoidance involving chemical sensing, to barrier formation, or usage of nematocysts. For
example, the sea anemone Anthopleura xanthogrammmica
will 'tolerate' adjacent clonal individuals, but will attempt to
'reject' heterogenic clones with which it comes into contact
[24,25]. In the anthozoans, Stylophora pistillata and Montipora verrucosa branches within one colony will readily fuse
while branches of genetically different individuals never

The availability of whole genome sequences of two basal cnidarians at respectably high levels of redundancy - the hydrozoan Hydra magnipapillata (>6-fold coverage) and the
anthozoan Nematostella vectensis (>7.6-fold coverage [17]) together with large-scale EST datasets for these and for the
coral Acropora millepora potentially offer new perspectives
on the origins of mammalian immune functions. Here we

undergo fusion [22,26,27]. Fusion of two conspecific individuals is occasionally referred to as 'natural transplantation'.
Observations in sea anemones (Anthopeura elegantissima,
Phymactis clematis) and gorgonians (Eunicella stricta) indicate that individual colonies possess unique sets of histocompatibility elements, which are recognized as nonself by all
other conspecific colonies [23,28]. In Hydrozoa, the same
phenomenon was reported for Millepora dichotoma [29] and
studied in great detail in the colonial marine hydroid Hydractinia echinata [30]. Hydractinia in fact was among the first
invertebrates shown to display a genetically based system of
intolerance against allogenic tissue: for more than 50 years it
has been known that allorecognition and the inability to fuse
stolons of different colonies is under the control of one polymorphic gene [31,32]. Recent efforts using defined genetic
lines of the hydroid Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus have
confirmed this and shown that the single chromosomal
region contains at least two loci [33].

Whereas only four TIR proteins are present in Hydra, substantially more could be identified amongst the predicted
proteins from Nematostella using HMM-based search methods. Five of them were sufficiently complete to be included in
the analyses presented here. These include a single MyD88
homolog (NvMyD88) and a protein (NvTLR-1) clearly related
to members of the Toll/TLR family (Figure 2). Whereas the
mammalian TLRs, and some members of the fly Toll/TLR
family, have only a carboxy-terminal cysteine-rich motif
flanking the LRRs proximal to the membrane, Nematostella
NvTLR-1 is predicted to contain both carboxy- and aminoterminal-flanking cysteine-rich motifs in the extracellular
part of the protein (Figure 2). This suggests that fly and anemone Toll more closely reflect the ancestral domain structure
than do the mammalian TLRs. Moreover, a phylogenetic
analysis (Figure 3) groups the TIR in Nematostella NvTLR-1
with its fly and human counterparts, with strong bootstrap
support. Surprisingly, three more of the predicted Nematostella TIR proteins also contain multiple immunoglobulin
(Ig) domains (Figure 2), and thus reflect the domain structure
of mammalian interleukin 1 receptors (IL-1Rs). NvIL-1R1 and
NvIL-1R2 each contain three Ig domains, and NvIL-1R3 contains two predicted Ig domains (Figure 2) but may be incomplete. In the phylogenetic analysis based on TIR domains the
Nematostella IL-1R-like proteins form a clade distinct from
both the MyD88 and Toll/TLR types (Figure 3), although
these cnidarian TIRs appear to be distinct from those in the
vertebrate IL-1Rs (data not shown). Several other TIR proteins were detected amongst the sequences of Nematostella
(Additional data file 1), but were not subjected to further analysis as the TIR domains were incomplete or the sequences
were judged likely to be artifactual. Two complete TIRs were
identified by searching the available coral datasets. The trace
archive yielded one TIR from Acropora palmata (ApGe-

Scyphozoa

Searching the Hydra predicted protein collection using the
available hidden Markov models (HMMs) identified only four
TIR domain-containing proteins, two of which are clearly
related to MyD88, which functions downstream of TLRs
(Table 1). Consistent with their assignment as MyD88 family
members, both of these Hydra proteins also contain the characteristic DEATH domain. The two other Hydra TIR proteins
are atypical transmembrane proteins in having relatively
short extracellular domains that are devoid of the LRR
domains that characterize Toll and the TLRs (Figure 2).
cDNAs encoding these proteins have previously been isolated
by the Bosch laboratory (unpublished data) and their functions are presently under investigation; these proteins are
known as HyTRR-1 and HyTRR-2. Surprisingly, extensive
searching of the Hydra genome and all available EST/cDNA
resources failed to identify any proteins having the canonical
Toll/TLR structure, characterized by possession of both LRR
and TIR domains.

nomic) and a second was encoded by an A. millepora EST
(AmTIR-1). These two coral TIRs are most similar to those in
the Nematostella IL-1R-like proteins (Figure 3), but no linked
domains have yet been identified in these cases.
The Müller group recently reported the identification of
MyD88 in a demosponge, Suberites domuncula [34]. However, whilst phylogenetic analyses clearly grouped the TIR in
this sponge sequence with those present in unambiguous
MyD88 orthologs (Figure 3), domain searching indicates that
the predicted sponge protein may not have a functional
DEATH domain.

The Toll/TLR pathway is ancestral but some
components are missing or highly divergent in Hydra
Most of the intracellular mediators of Toll/TLR signaling
could be identified in Nematostella and Acropora, but some
key components appear to have either been lost or diverged
beyond recognition in Hydra (Table 1). The absence of a Toll/
TLR protein sensu stricto from Hydra is discussed above, but
in addition only a single highly derived Rel domain could be
found in Hydra whereas unambiguous NF-κB homologs are
present in both Nematostella and Acropora (Table 1). In
addition to the pathway leading to nuclear localization of NFκB, Toll/TLR signaling can activate the Jun N-terminal
kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathways, leading to transcription of a range of target genes via the AP1 (activating protein 1)/ATF (activating

transcriptionfactor 1) factors. Toll/TLR signaling via JNK/
MAPK requires the participation of the ECSIT (evolutionarily
conserved signaling intermediate in Toll pathways) adaptor
protein [35], which also provides a link between the Toll/TLR
and TGF-b (transforming growth factor-beta)/BMP (bone
morphogenic protein) pathways [36]. The presence of ECSIT
as well as the key components of the JNK/MAPK pathway in
the cnidarian datasets (Table 1, Figure 4) indicates an early
origin for this variant of Toll/TLR signaling. The discovery of
a conserved predicted ECSIT coding sequence in the fresh
water sponge Ephydatia fluviatilis (N Funayama, personal
observation) additionally supports this view.
Wiens et al. [34] have suggested that a sponge-specific cell
surface protein known as SLIP (sponge LPS-interacting protein) functions as a pattern recognition receptor and effectively substitutes for Toll/TLR in antimicrobial defence. The
sponge MyD88-related protein nominally functions downstream of SLIP in the proposed pathway [34]. In support of
the idea that sponges lack Toll/TLRs, the authors cite a lack
of TLRs in a screen of 15,000 ESTs. As sponge 'MyD88' and
SLIP are co-immunoprecipitated by the reciprocal antibodies
[34], they clearly can interact in vitro. Some TLR pathway
components could also be identified in the available sponge
data, but the equivocal status of the sponge MyD88 related
protein means that it is unclear at this time whether sponges
have a canonical Toll/TLR pathway.

Searching for other components of the complement cascade,
we identified proteins containing a membrane attack complex/perforin domain (MAC/PF) similar to that present in
complement component C6 and related proteins. HMM
searching identified just two MAC/PF domain-containing
proteins in Hydra (Table 1), whereas four proteins were identified in Nematostella. Two MAC/PF proteins were also identified amongst the Acropora ESTs. Database searches and
analyses of predicted domain structures revealed that most of
the cnidarian MAC/PF sequences are likely to fall into three

C3 has a complex domain structure. Whilst anthozoan C3s
resemble their deuterostome counterparts both in domain
structure (Figure 5f) and sequence, not only could no corresponding gene be identified in Hydra, but also some of the

domains characteristic of C3 (ANATO, C345C; Figure 5f)
could not be detected in any Hydra protein. Although lacking
a canonical C3, Hydra contains a gene encoding A2M related
domains. Interestingly, in situ hybridization in Hydra using a
probe covering these typical A2M-related domains (Figure 5f;
A2M-comp/A2M-recep) showed expression restricted to the
endodermal epithelium (Figure 5g), as was the case with
Acropora C3.

refereed research

The complement component C3 has recently been reported in
another anthozoan cnidarian, the octocoral Swiftia [37], and
the corresponding gene has recently been cloned from Acropora (Hayward, unpublished data). The Acropora C3 (C3Am) gene is first expressed strongly in the endoderm of the
planula as it elongates following gastrulation (Figure 5a). The
endodermal expression is not uniform, being most intense in
a subset of dark staining cells that have not yet been characterized. As the planula elongates expression becomes somewhat weaker, with the strongest expression localized to the

expression is limited to the endoderm and is particularly

Phylogenetic analysis of cnidarian TIR sequences in comparison to a selection of TIR domains from other species
Phylogenetic analysis of cnidarian TIR sequences in comparison to a selection of TIR domains from other species. The maximum likelihood (ML) tree
shown is the result of analysis of an HMM-based alignment of TIR domains. A number of the TIR sequences identified and discussed in the text are
incomplete due to the presence of introns of unknown size, and hence were not included in the phylogenetic analyses. Three clades are resolved by these
analyses, corresponding to the TIR domains characteristic of the 'MyD88-type', 'Toll/TLR-type' and 'IL-1R-type'. In addition to the TIR domain, the first of
these types contains a death domain and the second contains multiple LRRs. Like the mammalian receptors for interleukin 1, the three Nematostella
proteins falling into the third clade each also contain multiple immunoglobulin domains. Note that HyTRR1 does not contain such domains and that it is
not yet clear whether either of the Acropora proteins does. The Acropora sequences included in the analysis were predicted from A. palmata genomic clones
(ApGenomic) and from an A. millepora cDNA clone (AmTIR-1). Hydra lacks a canonical Toll/TLR, having only two MyD88 genes and the two sequences
known as TRR-1 and TRR-2; H. magnipapillata and N. vectensis sequences are indicated by the prefixes Hy and Nv, respectively. Reference sequences:

groups corresponding to the known proteins types MPEG,
TX-60A and apextrin (Table 1, Figure 5h).
TBlastN-based searches of the Nematostella genome identified a gene matching strongly to the human macrophage
expressed protein 1 (MPEG1; GenBank:XP_166227) and its
abalone homolog abMPEG1 (GenBank:AAR82936) [38]. A
clearly related gene in S. domuncula has recently been implicated as an effector in a hypothetical sponge innate immune
defence pathway [34]. Recombinant Suberites MPEG has
anti-bacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, and is
up-regulated after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment [34].
The MPEG1 family clearly has an ancient evolutionary history
(the sponge and human sequences have 28% identity and
46% similarity) [34] but only in Suberites has any functional
characterization been done. Despite the presence of MPEG1
in the sponge and an anthozoan, no corresponding gene could
be identified in Hydra.
The nematocyst venom of at least some anthozoans contains
the protein TX-60A [39], and two of the Nematostella MAC/
PF proteins and one of the Acropora ESTs clearly correspond
to this protein type (Table 1). TX-60A has an epidermal
growth factor (EGF) domain immediately carboxy-terminal
of the MAC/PF domain. In Hydra, this domain structure can
be found in Hy-MAC, one of the two Hydra MAC/PF proteins
(Figure 5h, Table 1). However, it is unclear whether the
Hydra and anthozoan sequences are orthologous, as overall
sequence identity is low. In situ hybridization analysis shows
that expression of Hy-MAC is restricted to gland cells that are
interspersed throughout the endoderm of Hydra (Figure 5i).
Since endodermal gland cells and nematocysts are terminally
differentiated [40], this pattern of expression is not easy to
reconcile with a common function for the venom TX-60A and
Hy-MAC.

Apextrin, a gene lost from Nematostella
The third class of cnidarian MAC/PF proteins represented in
the Hydra and Acropora ESTs (Figure 5h) contains no identifiable domains other than MAC/PF. These proteins have
moderate overall similarity to the echinoderm apextrins
[41,42] and to the apicomplexan protein family to which the
Plasmodium membrane attack ookinete protein (MAOP)
[43] belongs. MAOP is responsible for rupture of epithelial
cells in the insect host by the ookinete stage of the parasite.
Surprisingly, apextrin seems to be a case of gene loss from
Nematostella as, despite clearly related genes being present
in Hydra and Acropora, extensive searching of both the predicted protein collection and the anemone genome using a
variety of tools failed to identify an apextrin-related gene
(Table 1).
To explore the significance of this case of apparent gene loss,
the expression pattern of an apextrin gene was examined by
in situ hybridization in Acropora (Figure 5k-o). Apextrin-Am
expression first appears in scattered ectodermal cells at the

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/4/R59

oral (blastopore) end of the embryo as it begins to elongate
following blastopore closure (Figure 5k). As the embryo continues to elongate expression increases in intensity and the
zone of expression spreads toward the aboral end, initially
still in scattered cells (Figure 5l), but as elongation continues
apparently in all ectodermal cells (Figure 5m), as is clear in
transverse section (Figure 5n). As the planula settles, expression becomes less obvious at the oral end, eventually becoming limited to a belt marking the transition between the tissue
that was formerly aboral (bottom), and the end bearing the
oral pore, which subsequently forms the mouth of the polyp
(Figure 5o). These expression data suggest that the primary
function of apextrin-Am is in the ectoderm leading up to metamorphosis; hence, secondary loss of the corresponding gene
from Nematostella may be explicable in terms of the very different modes of development of these two animals (see
Discussion).
In adult Hydra, whole mount in situ hybridization showed an
expression of the apextrin-like gene in groups of ectodermal
cells arising from the interstitial cell lineage (Figure 5j), which
may reflect a possible functional shift in an organism where
metamorphosis is absent.
In addition to the above, the Nematostella dataset yielded
MAC/PF domain-containing proteins having high similarity
to the neural cell adhesion molecule spondin-1 (Additional
data file 1).

Discussion

These preliminary analyses of the newly available genomic
and EST datasets indicate that a surprising number of key
components of the innate immune system, including the Toll/
TLR pathway and some complement cascade components,
were in place at the base of the Eumetazoa. Also represented
in the datasets are proteins strongly matching both the tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) and Nod-like receptors and with the
same domain structures (data not shown).
The analyses presented here are consistent with the idea of a
genetically complex common metazoan ancestor [12,13];
clearly the Toll/TLR, MyD88 and IL-1R protein families were
distinct prior to the divergence of the Cnidaria from the Bilateria, and a Toll/TLR pathway may predate even the Porifera/
Eumetazoa split. The discovery of proteins with the same
domain structure as the IL-1R in Nematostella indicates that
this receptor type predates chordate origins and that its original ligands may not have been interleukins. However, as the
TIR domains in the cnidarian IL-1R-like and mammalian IL1R proteins are divergent, separate evolutionary origins cannot yet be ruled out despite the similarities at the level of
domain structure.
It is also likely that a prototypic complement effector pathway
involving C3 and multiple MAC/PF proteins was in place in

Signaling4pathways downstream of the Toll/TLRs
Signaling pathways downstream of the Toll/TLRs. Pattern recognition, either indirectly or directly, by Toll/TLRs results in activation of NF-κB (vertebrates)
or the Dif/Rel heterodimer (Drosophila) and thus transcription of appropriate immune response genes. At TRAF6, the classic Toll/TIR pathway (shown in
the right branch) is linked to the JNK/p38 pathway (shown in the left branch) by the ECSIT protein, which acts as a regulator of MEKK-1 processing [35].
Components of both pathways downstream of Toll/TLRs are represented in the cnidarian datasets (Table 1). ECSIT may also act as a link between these
and the TGF-b signaling pathway, since it forms complexes with BMP-pathway restricted Smads and is essential for regulation of the BMP-target gene Tlx2
[36]. All of the components of the TGF-b signaling pathway are also known from anthozoan cnidarians [13].

Conclusion

refereed research
interactions

An important general implication that flows from these data
is that gene loss may occur stochastically. If the genes in a
pathway function only in that pathway, then one might expect
that entire pathways would disappear following loss of one
key component. However, the Hydra data appear to contradict this; most of the intracellular intermediates of Toll/TLR
signaling are present despite loss of all of the major receptor
types (both Toll/TLR and the IL-1R types known from more
basal cnidarians are apparently absent from Hydra). Moreover, simple comparisons between related animals (for example, Nematostella versus Acropora) are unlikely to be
informative in terms of understanding the origins of genes
[50] - loss of a gene from Nematostella and loss of a specific
function in the indirect developing urchin seems more likely
than the independent co-option of the same protein to related
roles in Acropora and a direct developing urchin. Stochastic
loss underlying the distribution patterns of genes across the
Metazoa may account for some cases of assumed lateral gene
transfer - chance retention of an ancestral gene in one or a few
animal lineages might easily be confused with lateral transfer.
Reconstructing the genome of the common animal ancestor
will not, therefore, be a simple undertaking; it will require
whole genome data for a wide range of 'lower' as well as
'higher' animals.

information

Other specific cases of gene loss from Hydra have been documented [47] (Seneca, unpublished data), hence there are
precedents for the apparent loss of immune repertoire components reported here. More surprising is the implication
that gene losses may also have occurred in Nematostella, as
evidenced by the apparent absence of the apextrin gene that
is present in both Hydra and Acropora. This loss may be
associated with differences between Nematostella and Acropora during the planula to polyp transition. Metamorphosis
from the motile planula to the sessile polyp involves dramatic
tissue remodeling [48] and gene expression changes in Acropora (Grasso, unpublished data), and the massive up-regulation of apextrin leading up to and during metamorphosis
(Figure 5k-o) is consistent with a role in this process. It is
worthy of note that apextrin is expressed in the tissue that is
least remodeled at the time of metamorphosis. By contrast, it
appears that there are no dramatic events comparable to
Acropora metamorphosis occurring during this same period
of Nematostella development; rather, Nematostella undergoes a simple and continuous transition from planula to polyp
and appears to show some neotenous features, continuing to
glide over the bottom aboral end first for some time after metamorphosis [49], and never forming a pedal disc [50]. Thus,

loss of this gene may be related to the different modes of
development of these two animals. This comparison between
two anthozoans with different modes of development is
clearly reminiscent of the original identification of apextrin as
a gene specifically expressed in the 'direct' developing seaurchin Heliocidaris erythrogramma during metamorphosis,
but which is not expressed during the development of H.
tuberculata, a congeneric 'indirect' developer [41,42].
Because indirect development is considered to be ancestral in
sea urchins, these authors hypothesized that apextrin had
been coopted to function in metamorphosis in H. erythrogramma. The specific ectodermal expression of homologous
proteins during metamorphosis in a cnidarian and an echinoderm is either a remarkable example of convergence or
reflects conservation of function at some level. This latter possibility carries with it the implication that the 'simple' continuous planula to polyp transition seen in Nematostella might
represent a derived state, and that the more dramatic metamorphosis seen in Acropora might more closely reflect the
ancestral condition.

reviews

The observation that genes of two of the three classes of cnidarian immune-repertoire genes examined here are
expressed in the endoderm (Figure 2) was unexpected, but is
consistent with the primary sites of expression of such genes
in many animals. In Drosophila, the fat body (an endodermal
derivative, and the functional homolog of the mammalian
liver) is the predominant source of the antimicrobial peptides
whose synthesis is under the control of the Toll and Imd pathways [44] and in Caenorhabditis the gut is the primary source
of antimicrobials [45,46]. Although mammalian skin contains immune sensory cells (Langerhans cells, dendritic cells
and so on), these are also endodermal derivatives, hence
there is a deep evolutionary link between the immune system
and the endoderm.

comment

Ureumetazoa. Comparisons of the TIR and MAC/PF complements of Hydra and Nematostella highlight the likely extent
of gene loss and sequence divergence in the former - not only
does Hydra appear to have lost the Toll-receptor, but NF-κB
has also either been lost or has diverged beyond recognition.
Moreover, only a few TIR proteins could be identified in
Hydra compared to the rich representation of these in the
anthozoans. In addition, Hydra appears to have lost a number
of MAC/PF proteins and lacks an equivalent of the ancestral
complement C3 protein, implying that although anthozoans
most likely have a prototype complement effector pathway,
this has undergone degeneration in Hydra. Hydra is an efficient producer of a number of potent antimicrobial peptides
(Bosch, unpublished data), indicating that at least some of the
functions of the complement effector system may have been
subsumed by pathways involved in synthesis of these
peptides.

For database searches a local Blast-platform [51] and the public Blast platform at NCBI [54] were used. Domain searches
were performed using SMART [55] and a local install of
HMMer [56]. Profile HMMs for the investigated domains
were obtained from PFAM [57] and Superfamily [58] databases. Seqtools [59] and BioEdit [60] were used for general
sequence analysis. Protein sequence alignments were created
using ClustalW [61] and the HMMalign script included in the
HMMer package. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses
were undertaken using MolPhy version 2.3 [62] using the
Dayhoff substitution matrix and local rearrangement search
mode.
