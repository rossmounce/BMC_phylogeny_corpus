Abstract
Background: Genome-wide studies on autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have mostly focused on large-scale
population samples, but examination of rare variations in isolated populations may provide additional insights into
the disease pathogenesis.
Methods: As a first step in the genetic analysis of ASD in Croatia, we characterized genetic variation in a sample of
103 subjects with ASD and 203 control individuals, who were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550
BeadChip. We analyzed the genetic diversity of the Croatian population and its relationship to other populations,
the degree of relatedness via Runs of Homozygosity (ROHs), and the distribution of large (>500 Kb) copy number
variations.
Results: Combining the Croatian cohort with several previously published populations in the FastME analysis (an
alternative to Neighbor Joining) revealed that Croatian subjects cluster, as expected, with Southern Europeans; in
addition, individuals from the same geographic region within Europe cluster together. Whereas Croatian subjects
could be separated from a sample of healthy control subjects of European origin from North America, Croatian
ASD cases and controls are well mixed. A comparison of runs of homozygosity indicated that the number and the
median length of regions of homozygosity are higher for ASD subjects than for controls (p = 6 × 10–3).
Furthermore, analysis of copy number variants found a higher frequency of large chromosomal rearrangements
(>2 Mb) in ASD cases (5/103) than in ethnically matched control subjects (1/197, p = 0.019).
Conclusions: Our findings illustrate the remarkable utility of high-density genotype data for subjects from a limited
geographic area in dissecting genetic heterogeneity with respect to population and disease related variation.

Background
Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD, MIM209850) are a
severe neuropsychiatric disorders, primarily characterized by abnormalities in social behavior, communication
and language, with patterns of restricted and repetitive
interests [1]. Commonly associated symptoms include
aggressive and self-injurious behaviors, anxiety, heightened sensitivity to stimuli, and seizures [2,3]. Severity

of symptoms in ASD can vary widely among cases, from
individuals with mental retardation and no language
production to relatively high-functioning individuals
with normal to superior intelligence but significant difficulties with social interaction [4-6].
Multiple lines of evidence converge to suggest that
ASDs represent the most heritable neurodevelopmental
and psychiatric conditions. Evidence from twin and
family studies suggests that the rate of autism in siblings
of affected individuals is 2-6% [7], with 92% concordance of ASD in monozygotic twins and over 10% concordance in dizygotic twins [8]. Previous linkage and
candidate gene studies have identified several chromosomal regions with autism susceptibility loci [3,9-13].

A recent study identified a common genetic risk factor
underlying ASD employing a genome-wide association
strategy in 780 families (3,101 subjects) with affected
children, and a second cohort of 1,204 affected subjects
and 6,491 control subjects; these findings were replicated in an independent study cohort of 483 ASD
families [14]. Furthermore, substantial progress towards
the identification of genetic risk variants has come from
recent characterization of structural variation (i.e., copy
number variation or CNV). Studies of CNVs in a cohort
of 859 ASD cases and 1,400 healthy control children
revealed structural variants in previously reported ASD
candidate genes (NRXN1 and CNTNAP4) and in multiple novel susceptibility genes encoding cell-adhesion
molecules, including NLGN1 and ASTN2. Furthermore,
CNVs observed in cases but not controls were found
within and surroundings genes involved in the ubiquitin
pathway (UBE3A, PARK2, RFWD2 and FBXO40) [15].
In a related study, we performed high-density genotyping and obtained data on 3,832 individuals from 912
multiplex ASD families in the Autism Genetic Research
Exchange (AGRE) and 1,489 unrelated control subjects.
Through prioritization of exonic deletions (eDels), we
recovered genes in which structural variants were present in multiple unrelated probands but not unrelated
controls. The 42 genes identified by this method include
NRXN1, UBE3A, MADCAM1 and BZRAP1 [16]. Studies
of large families with shared ancestry have reported several other autism loci including large, inherited, homozygous deletions in neuronal cell-adhesion genes, for
example PCDH10 (protocadherin 10) [17]. These findings highlight the utility of “homozygosity mapping” and
a need to search for additional large families across
diverse populations.
Based on these breakthroughs and lessons learned
from studies of other complex diseases (i.e. diabetes and
breast cancer), it is becoming apparent that there is a
need to assess large sample collections that number in
the tens of thousands. Population structure poses a challenge for large-scale disease-association studies; mismatched ancestry between cases and controls in a
genome-wide association studies is a potential source of
spurious associations [17]. These needs and challenges
bring together usually separated fields of genetics, epidemiology and studies of human diversity. Also, it is
important to relate genetic findings found in patients
from developed countries to the studies of diverse populations in less developed parts of the world. Currently
DNA has been assembled from only a few thousand
individuals with autism worldwide. Significant advances
in genetic analyses of ASD in diverse populations will
require the collection of samples across many populations using rapid and affordable screening and diagnostic tools.

Isolated populations have contributed to the discovery
of genetic factors for many Mendelian disorders [18]. It
has been argued that isolated populations may facilitate
the identification of susceptibility loci for complex diseases because of a reduced genetic diversity, i.e. reduced
genetic heterogeneity [19,20]. Although several Croatian
island populations have been described as genetic isolates, the Croatian population as a whole does not
represent a population isolate as conventionally defined
[21,22]. However, Croatia is a small country with a low
migration rate, in which large extended families often
live in the same household or same neighbourhood and,
therefore, is perfectly suited for family-based genetic
studies. We expect that a subset of affected individuals
may segregate a limited number of causative ASD susceptibility alleles (causal variants); in some cases these
loci or disease-associated haplotypes identified in genetic
isolates may differ from those in more genetically
diverse populations, such as Europeans in North America. We also expect that a subset of rare variants associated with ASD susceptibility (SNPs and CNVs), which
were identified in a large set of Europeans from North
America, may be more prevalent in specific ethnic
groups like the Croats. Therefore, to improve our
understanding of global patterns of human genetic variation and set the stage for large-scale disease studies,
efforts are underway to evaluate genetic variation using
high-density genotype data for human populations
worldwide [23-25].
With the intention to use the Croatian population in
future genome-wide association studies, we performed a
genome-wide high-density genotype pilot study of 103
ASD cases and 203 control samples to characterize the
genetic structure of the population. Our analysis focuses
on (1) the genetic diversity of the Croatian population,
and its relationship to other populations, (2) the degree
of relatedness of the population through the analysis of
Runs of Homozygosity (ROHs), and (3) the distribution
of large (>500 Kb) copy number variations, a major
mechanism for structural variation in human genomes,
and its possible association with ASD.

Results and Discussion
To understand the complexities of genomic architecture
of ASDs, a highly heterogeneous group of disorders, and
to assess the distribution and specificity of common and
rare variants in different populations, we initiated genomic analysis of ASD and control subjects from Croatia.
This cohort, consisting of 103 subjects (children and
adults) with ASD and 203 adult control subjects, with
male-to-female ratios of 3.7:1 (in ASD) and 2.6:1 (in
controls), was originally recruited to study the role of
hyperserotonemia in autism [26-28]. Patients with autism were evaluated by a child psychiatrist and diagnoses

were based on DSM-IV-TR [29] criteria. Severity of
behavioral symptoms was measured using the Childhood
Autism Rating Scale (CARS) [30]. The degree of mental
retardation (MR) was assessed according to the standardized intelligence or developmental tests, corresponding
to the apparent developmental level of each individual.
ASD in selected families occurs either in the absence of
positive family history (sporadic) or in families with a
high prevalence of other clinical psychiatric disorders
distinct from ASD (such as anxiety, depression and phobias). During the clinical assessment and interviews, psychiatrists and geneticists did not notice any recognizable
dysmorphic features in selected study subjects. DNA
samples isolated from whole blood were genotyped with
the Illumina HumanHap550 SNP array and 306 samples
gave high quality data that were subjected to population
structure and CNV analysis. See Table 1 for a summary
of the genome-wide datasets used in this study.
To understand the genetic homogeneity of the Croatian cohort and its position in the worldwide human
population, we used phylogenetic tree analysis, principal
component analysis (PCA) (not shown), and multidimensional scaling (MDS), three tools commonly used
in the study of human population genetic diversity
[23,24]. We used data from the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP), which consists of genome-wide
SNP data of 1007 individuals from 51 populations,
divided into 7 geographic regions. Of these individuals,
153 were from 8 populations from the European region.
We plotted the results of MDS and tree analyses using
control subjects from Croatia and the HGDP samples
(Figure 1). All three methods show the same overall pattern emerging from previous HGDP studies: the relative
positions of the major regions largely correlate with
their relative geographical locations, and reflect the
human migration history well. Humans migrated from
Africa to the Middle East (Figure 1A-B); the first

branching took place, and one group migrated to Europe, while the other migrated to South Asia. A second
major branching then occurred, with one migration to
America (through Alaska), the other countinuing to East
Asia and eventually Oceania. As expected, the Croatia
control samples are entirely contained within the European samples. A focused analysis of Europeans in the
HGDP panel (Figure 1C-D) with the Croatia control
samples situated in the middle of phylogeny or MDS
plots shows the relationship of this subpopulation to
other European populations. The Sardinians and the
Basques seem to be the farthest, with Italian samples
placed in between them and the Croatian controls; the
other subpopulation that is separate from the Croatia
controls is the Adygei. The Croatians are most similar
to the Russians and the Orcadians. Both the PCA (not
shown) and MDS plots show the relative diversity of the
Croatian controls (indicated by the area spanned by the
samples on the MDS and PCA plots) to be similar to
the other populations. The boxplot of pairwise Identity
by State (IBS) distances for European populations (Figure 2A) showed the Croatian control cohort has divergence similar to other European subpopulations (except
Basques and Sardinians who are genetically more homogeneous), and smaller than the European population as
a whole.
We performed MDS on the Croatian controls and
cases, as well as NINDS (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke) control cohorts to check the
relationships between the three cohorts (Figure 2B), and
found that the Croatian control and cases are well
mixed but separate from the NINDS controls. Randomization tests by shuffling between Croatian control and
NINDS controls showed the median pairwise IBS (identity-by-state) distance across the two subsets (0.28) is
significantly higher than expected by chance (p =
0.00273, see Figure 3); this agrees with the MDS visualization that the two cohorts are genetically separate.
Analysis of fixation index (FST) led to the same conclusion (see Table 2 for top regions with large F ST ). In
summary, the Croatian and the NINDS cohorts have
significant genetic difference, and care must be taken to
correct for population stratification in combining the
two datasets for association studies.
Mapping of large regions of homozygosity in pedigrees
with shared ancestry has been employed in the discovery
of autosomal recessive diseases associated with neurodevelopmental anomalies [31-33], and more recently, in
the identification of novel genes associated with ASD,
schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s Disorder [17,34,35].
Although we recruited unrelated ASD cases and healthy
controls, we analyzed genome-wide rates of homozygosity to estimate consanguinity and compared these rates
to a heterogeneous control sample of Europeans from

North America. It has been suggested that mapping of
extended tracks of homozygosity may facilitate identification of low-frequency variants associated with complex diseases [36,37]. We detected regions (“runs”) of
homozygosity (ROH) using the PLINK v1.05 software
[38] and compared the extent of homozygosity in Croatia ASD cases, control subjects and NINDS controls.
We computed the number of ROH segments, total
ROH length, and average ROH length for the three subsets (Table 3). We detected subtle differences between
the three groups for the median number of ROHs
(Kruskal-Wallis test; p = 0.06), as well as average ROH
length between Croatia controls and NINDS controls
(Wilcoxon test; p = 0.053), with NINDS cohort showing
shorter total ROH length than Croatia controls (Kruskal-Wallis test; p = 0.0056, higher due to the very large
number of NINDS samples). However, the most significant pairwise difference is the total ROH length between

Croatian cases Croatian controls (Wilcoxon test; p =
0.0065).
Motivated by the study demonstrating the positive
correlation between runs of homozygosity and age in a
North American cohort of European descent due to
urbanization [35], we examined age correlation with
ROH frequency and size in the 103 ASD subjects (Figure 4 and Table 4). We found only borderline significance between age and average ROH size, though the
lack of significance may be due to the fact that the
Croatia ASD cohort is 40 years younger (mean age is
21.5 y as opposed to 61.7 y in Nalls et al. [35]).
ROH regions were common or specific for a demographic group (Croatia vs. North America) or a disease
status (ASD vs. controls). Although the longest ROH
regions do not need to necessarily coincide with the
disease susceptibility, we cannot exclude a possibility
that recessive variants, such as single nucleotide or

copy number variants within these regions contribute
to disease susceptibility. To identify which regions contribute to the significant difference between Croatia
case and control groups, we sorted the 7,740 endpoints
of all autosomal ROHs across Croatia case and control
groups, computed the significance of association
between ROH status and case/control status by Fisher’s test for each pair of adjacent ROH endpoints, and
examined the significance of each such ROH interval
where at least 5% (15) individuals have the ROH
(Table 5). The most significant ROHs are in two chromosomal regions: chr2:82,040,863-82,677,336 (2p12)
and chr6:29,481,192-29,719,410 (6p21.1) (Figure 5 and
Figure 6). It is striking these two homozygosity regions
are near several genes previously associated with neurological and psychiatric disorders. The chromosome 2
interval (636 Kb) is located downstream of CTNNA2
(alpha catenin) and LRRTM1 (leucine-rich repeat
transmembrane neuronal protein 1), and contains a
segment (between SNPs rs2685729 and rs2862972) significantly enriched in ASD subjects (top p = 2.5 × 10-

3

). The LRRTM1 gene is associated with left-handedness (patients with autism and many other psychiatric
disorders have a higher tendency to be left-handed
[39]) and may increase risk of schizophrenia [40,41].
The chromosome 6 interval (238 Kb) is a gene-rich
region located distal to the major histocompatibility
complex. This ROH is shared by 17 ASD subjects
(16.5%) and 19 controls (9.6%) spans 8 genes, including
a cluster of olfactory receptors (OR11A1, OR10C1,
OR2H1, OR2H2), the MOG locus, and the GABBR1
locus. The MOG gene (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein) is a transmembrane protein expressed on the
surface of myelin sheath, and may be involved in multiple sclerosis (OMIM#126200) [42,43]; recent studies
also found that MOG is differentially expressed in prefrontal cortex and temporal lobes in schizophrenic
patients [43,44]. The most significant interval (between
SNPs rs1233399 and rs29225; top p = 3.4 × 10 -3 )
spans the 3’ end of the GABBR1 (Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) B receptor, 1) and the overlapping
UBD (Ubiquitin D) loci. GABBR1 is highly expressed

in nervous systems and has been suggested as a candidate region for neuropsychiatric disorders [45,46]. A
recent study showed that the expression levels of
GABBR1 are significantly lower in several brain
regions in patients with autism compared with healthy
controls [47]. Finally, we examined the median IBS distances between the subjects with regions of homozygosity on chromosomes 2 (13 Croatian cases and 10
Croatian controls) and chromosome 6 (17 Croatian
cases and 19 Croatian controls) with permutation tests,

but found that these subjects were not more closely
related than the population average. Thus, the
increased homozygosity in Croatia ASD cases cannot
be explained by inbreeding among close relatives in a
small number of selected families. However, the
observed homozygosity may be the result of shared
ancestral alleles from generations back in time.
Several studies have shown a role for copy number
variation in predisposing individuals to complex diseases
[48], including ASD [15,49-52]. To address this, we next

analyzed CNV calls from the high-density SNP genotyping data in Croatia cases and control subjects. We used
PennCNV [53], a high-resolution CNV detection
method, to call CNVs from the signal intensity data. We
identified 2,303 CNVs (using a 10-SNP threshold) in
304 subjects passing the quality control criteria (Table
6). The median size of CNVs is 71.4 Kb, while the mean
size of CNVs is 131.4 Kb. Due to the relatively small
sample size, we do not expect that we could detect association of specific CNVs with disease status; instead, we
focused on large and rare CNVs observed in cases but
not controls, since they are more likely to be diseaserelated. For example, a recent study identified large
(>500 Kb) CNVs to be especially pathogenic [54]; in
addition, a CNV study on schizophrenia demonstrates
that CNVs >500 Kb tend to be more prevalent in cases
versus controls [55-57], and that CNVs >2 Mb are
observed exclusively in cases [15,16].

Page 8 of 19

Examining 299 unrelated individuals passing QC, we
identified a total of 32 CNVs >500 Kb, including 20
duplications and 12 deletions (Table 7 and Table 8).
These large chromosomal rearrangements, detected in
DNA samples isolated from blood (rather then cell
lines), were confirmed through signal intensity data for
the entire chromosome in the Illumina BeadStudio software (data not shown). Among them, 5/103 cases
(4.85%) and 1/197 controls subject (0.49%) have CNVs
greater than 2 Mb. An exceptionally large CNV was
detected in an ASD female that harbored an 18 Mb
duplication on chromosome 7 (7q21.11-21.3), which
includes several known neurodevelopmental genes
(PCLO, SEMA3A, SEMA3C, SEMA3D and SEMA3E). A
duplication of this chromosomal region has been associated with intellectual disability and multiple congenital
anomalies [58]. Another female has a 10 Mb deletion on
chromosome 11 (11q24.2-q25). The Jacobsen syndrome
(MIM147791) is a contiguous gene syndrome caused by
terminal deletions of the long arm of chromosome 11
and typically associated with growth and psychomotor
retardation and characteristic facial dimorphism [59].
Three of the ASD cases have multiple large rearrangements; one adult male harbors two chromosomal rearrangements (separated by 117 Mb) on chromosome 1, a
335 Kb deletion on 1p35.3 and a 882 Kb duplication on
1q21.1 (Figure 7a). In a second individual (adult female)
we identified two distinct large CNVs: a 838 Kb deletion
in an intergenic region between GRM8 and POT1 on
7q31.33 (chr7:124,752,465-125,591,197) and a 691 Kb
deletion at 22q13.33 (chr22:48,833,840-49,524,956). This
deletion encompasses the SHANK3 gene and cytogenetic
rearrangements affecting this gene have been previously
associated with ASD [60,61]. It has been previously
reported that the 22q13 deletion syndrome, also known
as Phelan-McDermid syndrome (MIM606232), is characterized by severe neonatal hypotonia and global developmental delay, normal to accelerated growth, absent to
severely delayed speech, and minor dysmorphic features
[62,63]. The third individual (male child) with multiple
large rearrangements harbors a 534 Kb intergenic deletion at 2q21.1 (chr2: 129,716,352-130,250,751) and a
400 Kb duplication at 3q29 (chr3:195,987,870196,387,903). These large structural variants, especially
those found on multiple chromosomes illustrate the
need to combine high-density genotype analysis with
karyotype analysis to test for the presence of balanced
translocations and inversions.
In contrast to large rearrangements encompassing >10
Mbs that were observed in ASD cases, the largest rearrangement observed in control subjects is a 2.5 Mb
duplication at 15q24.1-q24.2 (chr15:70,783,08973,316,235), a known microdeletion/duplication region
[64]. Also, we found one control subject to have two

duplications within the DiGeorge (MIM188400) and
Velocardiofacial (MIM192430) syndrome region on
chromosome 22 (22q11.21), a known pathogenic rearrangement hotspot where large (>1.5 Mb) deletions are
pathogenic [65]. These duplications (922 Kb in
chr22:17,690,812-18,613,429 and 563 Kb in
chr22:19,102,598-19,665,559) are separated by 489 Kb.
The observation that we see more large CNVs associated with ASD subjects (>2 Mb: 5 cases, 1 control;
Fisher’s test; p = 0.019) suggests these large rearrangements may be rare ASD susceptible variants; follow-up
investigations on larger cohorts will be necessary.

Conclusions
In this paper, we report analysis of a genome-wide highdensity genotype study for ASD in Croatia. The dataset,
although small, provides a distinctive opportunity to evaluate structural variation associated with a complex disease
such as ASD in a genetically distinct population. In addition to the analysis of ASD, high-density genotype data
from a well-defined geographic area of Croatia permitted
also the study of the subjects’ genetic substructure and
diversity. We asked whether the subjects included in this
study which were collected throughout Croatia, show a
lower level of genomic diversity in comparison to subjects
from other defined demographic areas. Addressing this
issue may suggest that a set of 100 Croatian ASD subjects
harbor a smaller set of susceptibility loci in comparison a
randomly selected set of ASD subjects from a larger area.
The Croatian samples represent a genetic continuum of
relatedness with a subset of individuals closer to those
from several regions in Europe, probably due to numerous
historic migrations. The impact of fine-scale population
history on the genetic substructure of individuals from
Croatia has recently been evaluated using a small set of
selected loci [21]. To our knowledge, this study is the first
to provide a genome-wide view of the genetic composition
of the Croatia population.
Although our study represents the first high-resolution
genomic analysis of subjects with ASD in Croatia, several caveats need to be addressed. Apart from an
obviously limited sample size, the classification of ASD

subjects in this pilot project has been established using
the DSM-IV criteria. Due to phenotypic heterogeneity of
ASD and our finding of a wide-range of novel, and in
some cases, exceptionally large CNVs, there is a need
for accurate clinical diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis
of ASD and related neurodevelopmental syndromes.
Currently no other diagnostic tools were available in
Croatian; in order to compare our findings to those in
other large-scale genetic studies it will be necessary to
translate gold standard diagnostic tools such as ADOS
[66] and ADI-R [67] to Croatian and many other
languages.
We used PennCNV to call copy number variations,
though other CNV calling programs such as QuantiSNP
[68] and cnvPartition (a built-in software tool in the
Illumina BeadStudio software)are available An advantage
of using multiple CNV calling programs is to reduce
false positives, namely one can focus on CNVs returned
by multiple programs and expect them to be “more reliable”. Since our study focused on large CNVs (>500 Kb)
we were able to validate these variants by visual inspection of the raw intensities(data not shown).
We found that runs of homozygosity are more frequent in Croatia ASD subjects than either Croatia or
NINDS control cohorts. Given the low frequency of
subjects with ROH, larger follow-up studies are necessary to confirm the findings. Our findings suggest there
is a high chance that homozygosity mapping based on
family studies can discover rare recessive variants. Our
finding that several ASD subjects harbor exceptionally
large chromosomal rearrangements previously associated
with distinct clinical syndromes such as Velocardiofacial,
Jacobsen, Phelan-McDermid, or 3q29 microdeletion/
duplication syndromes (MIM609425; MIM611936) lends
support for cytogenetic or high-density genotype testing
for ASD subjects with complex clinical manifestation
[69]. Furthermore, recent findings that seemingly diverse
neurodevelopmental and neurological disorders are
often associated with the same chromosomal rearrangement(s) provide support for in-depth phenotype analysis
and longitudinal clinical evaluation of entire families.
These family-based studies may also reveal whether

observed structural variants are de novo events or rather
inherited and present in additional family members. We
suggest that deeper population screens combined with
family-based genetic analyses will lead to improved
understanding of joint actions of associated loci and
molecular basis of neurodevelopmental disorders in
populations worldwide.

Methods
Subjects and DNA Preparation

The patient group consisted of 103 individuals (81 male,
22 female, mean age 21.5 ± 10.3, ranging from 4 to 45)
recruited from the Centers for Autism in Zagreb, Rijeka
and Split (Republic of Croatia) and diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders according to DSM-IV criteria.

where ROH status is associated with case/control status in the Croatia cohort.

The control group consisted of 203 healthy blood
donors (146 male, 57 female, mean age 32.5 ± 8.06, ranging from 19 to 45) [30] with no history of mental illnesses, behavioral disorders, or substance abuse. All
subjects were of Croatian (southern Slavic) origin. After
an informative talk, a written consent for inclusion in
the study was obtained from the control subjects and
from the patients’ parents. The study has been carried
out in accord with the Declaration of Helsinki, and was
approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical
Faculty of the University of Zagreb.
Blood sampling was performed in the Centers for Autism (ASD cases) and in the Croatian Institute of Transfusion Medicine (control subjects) between 9 and 11 a.
m. Either 2 or 5 ml of venous blood, depending on the
age of the participants, was collected into vacutainers
containing EDTA anticoagulant. DNA was isolated from
the whole blood using a DNA isolation kit for mammalian blood (Boehringer Manheim, Germany).
Datasets and Preprocessing

The genomic DNA from blood was used to obtain genotypes by the Illumina HumanHap550 version 3 highdensity array with 561,446 SNP markers. Coordinates of

SNPs as well as genomic annotations are based on
NCBI human genome build 36.3, (UCSC Genome Browser Release 18). The genotyping experiments were performed at the Center for Applied Genomics, Children’s
Hospital of Philadelphia, as previously described [70].
The raw genotyping signal data were processed by the
Illumina BeadStudio software and converted to normalized signal intensity values, represented as Log R Ratio
(LRR) and B Allele Frequency (BAF). Due to the presence of “genomic wave patterns” in some of the genotyped samples, we applied a data pre-processing
protocol [71] to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the
LRR values for all samples.
We analyzed three genome-wide datasets: Croatia
Autism cohort (306 subjects), NINDS Control cohort
(542 subjects), and genotyping data from the Human
Genetic Diversity Panel (1043 subjects, genotyped at
Stanford University, downloaded from http://hagsc.org/
hgdp/files.html). The quality control (QC) procedure
(described in detail in Wang et al. [14] and Bucan et al.
[16]), done separately for the three datasets, is as follows: (1) we first discarded SNPs with 5% or more missing genotyping calls; (2) we then recomputed summary
statistics for individuals and markers; (3) we retained

control samples using PLINK. We found 5 pairs of
Croatia control samples (but none among the case sam∧
ples) and 4 pairs of NINDS control samples have  >
0.25 (siblings or closer). To be more specific, three
Croatia control pairs and one NINDS control pair have
∧
 > 0.999 (duplicate genotyping or monozygotic twins),
and two Croatia Ctrl pairs and three NINDS control
∧
pairs have  around 0.5 (first-degree relatives). To
reduce relatedness, in subsequent analysis, for each pair
we removed the one of the two samples with a larger
index number in the ROH analysis. Table 1 summarizes
the three genome-wide datasets analyzed in this paper.

IBS distance analysis

We computed the IBS (identity by state) distance
between any two subjects using PLINK, and constructed
three pairwise distance matrices: Croatia controls and
HGDP, Croatia controls and NINDS, Croatia cases and
controls. The IBS distance between two subjects is
defined as A+B/2, where A and B are the number of
SNPs that differ by one and two alleles between the two
subjects, respectively. We performed multidimensional
scaling using R [73] and plotted the first two coordinates, and built trees using FastME, a distance-based
phylogeny reconstruction software [74].

FST Analysis

To quantitatively describe the genetic difference
between two population we next used the FST coefficient
(fixation coefficient). This measure combines information across many loci in many individuals and a higher
FST value for a locus indicates difference between the
genetic compositions in two populations, whereas FST =
0 implies no discernable difference between two populations at the locus.
We analyzed the FST values using the Croatia control
and NINDS control cohorts as follows. We first computed the heterozygosity of each marker (defined as the
proportion of heterozygous individuals in the population) using PLINK, then computed the fixation index
FST from the heterozygosity by R by the following steps.
(1) Compute the minor allele frequencies p 1 , p 2 and
p for the two subpopulations (with N1 and N2 subjects)
and the whole population (with N = N1 + N2 subjects).
(2) Compute the expected proportion of heterozygotes
H T = p (1-p) assuming the two subpopulations are
genetically identical for the marker. (2) Compute the
expected proportion of heterozygotes HS = (N1 p1 (1-p1)
.
+ N2 p2 (1-p2))/N. (3) Compute FST = 1 − H S
H
T

Runs of homozygosity

Runs of homozygosity (ROHs) are extended genomic
regions where the DNA sequences on the two chromosomes are identical, and may be due to identity by descent or gene conversion; since polymorphic sites are all
homozygous, SNP arrays can be used to identify such
regions. Study of ROHs can provide information on the
population structure such as extent of inbreeding, and
can be used to find candidate genes in recessive disorders. We computed the distribution of runs of homozygosity for three groups (Croatia case, control, NINDS)
using PLINK with the following settings: an interval
passes as an ROH if it has 100 or more homozygous
SNPs (except at most one SNP), with density at least one
SNP every 50 Kb and at most 1 Kb gap between any two
neighboring SNPs. We ran Wilcoxon test between every
pair of the three groups, as well as Kruskal-Wallis test for
comparing three groups simultaneously.

To identify genomic regions where the ROH status correlates with the case/control status, we ran
Fisher’s test as follows: we first sorted the 7,766
endpoints of all autosomal ROHs across Croatia
case and control groups; for each pair of adjacent
endpoints, we computed the significance of association between ROH status and case/control status
by Fisher’s test.

Correlation between ROH and age

Received: 11 December 2009 Accepted: 21 September 2010
Published: 21 September 2010

Motivated by the study demonstrating the positive correlation between runs of homozygosity and age in a
North American cohort of European descent due to
urbanization [35], we examined the correlation between
age and ROH frequency and size. Only the 103 ASD
subjects have age information. We used age and sex as
covariates in a full linear regression model (in R/S-Plus
specification):
Y ~ AGE * SEX

Here the dependent variable can be either the total
ROH length, average ROH length, or number of ROH
regions in a subject.
CNVs analysis

A previously described high-resolution CNV detection
algorithm, the PennCNV algorithm [53], was used to
infer CNVs from the signal intensity data following protocols described in Wang et al. [53] The PennCNV algorithm uses a Hidden Markov model to identify any
genomic regions with duplications or deletions by combining signal intensity and SNP allelic ratio distributions. The Illumina BeadStudio software provided
visualization tools that were used to display signal intensity data for the entire chromosome.
