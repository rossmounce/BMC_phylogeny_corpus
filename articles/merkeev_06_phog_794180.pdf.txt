Abstract
Background: Orthologs and paralogs are widely used terms in modern comparative genomics.
Existing procedures for resolving orthologous/paralogous relationships are often based on manual
revision of clusters of orthologous groups and/or lack any rigorous evolutionary base.
Description: We developed a completely automated procedure that creates clusters of
orthologous groups at each node of the taxonomy tree (PHOGs – Phylogenetic Orthologous
Groups). As a result of this procedure, a tree of orthologous groups was obtained. Each cluster is
a "supergene" and it is represented by an "ancestral" sequence obtained from the multiple alignment
of orthologous and paralogous genes.
The procedure has been applied to the taxonomy tree of organisms from all three domains of life.
Protein complements from 50 bacterial, archaeal and eukaryotic species were used to create
PHOGs at all tree nodes. 51367 PHOGs were obtained at the root node.
Conclusion: The PHOG database demonstrates that it is possible to automatically process any
number of sequenced genomes and to reconstruct orthologous and paralogous relationships
between genomes using a rigorous evolutionary approach. This database can become a very useful
tool in various areas of comparative genomics.

Background
Evolutionary forces acting on genomes result in gene
duplications, gene losses and gene acquisitions. Generally, it is difficult to reconstruct the exact evolutionary history of a protein family due to its complex nature. A
widely used approach to study such history is to find
orthologous groups by comparing completely sequenced
genomes. This approach resulted in several databases [14] that helped to predict protein function and provided
deep insights into the protein evolution. These proce-

dures, however, did not fully take into account the taxonomy tree of organisms.
Orthologs are genes derived from a single ancestral gene
as a result of the speciation event, while paralogs are genes
that result from gene duplication events [5-7]. The usefulness of orthologs and paralogs in modern genomics
comes from the fact that the products of orthologs generally perform the same function while the products of paralogs perform a similar function. We can give several
examples how the knowledge of orthologs and paralogs

helped to solve some difficult issues. Comparative studies
of bacterial transcriptional regulation often use orthologs
assuming that orthologs tend to be regulated in the same
way [8-10]. It is possible to predict functional coupling
between genes if orthologs of genes forming a functional
cluster in one organism will form a cluster in another
organism [11]. Leonid Mirny and Mikhail Gelfand [12]
have found specificity-determining positions in the LacI/
PuR family of bacterial transcription factors looking for
residues that are conserved among orthologs and are different in paralogs. Orthologs and paralogs also help to
understand the evolution by gene duplication, which is
thought to be a major force in creating organismal complexity [13,14]. If clusters of orthologous groups are
found that contain mainly genes from a particular group
of organisms [15,16], it is possible to better understand
physiology specific for this group of organisms.
Fig. 1 shows what issues might arise where resolving the
orthologous/paralogous relationships between genes. An
ancestral gene A creates a family of genes A1, A2, A3, A4, A5,
A6, A7 by three speciation events N1, N1, N3 and two gene
duplication events. The real evolution of gene families is
far more complex than this simple example creating a
complex network of orthologs and paralogs. A gene is
considered to be an ortholog or a paralog relative to a particular node N of the evolutionary tree if its ancestor at the
child node following the node N is a result of a speciation

event or a gene duplication event correspondingly. For
instance, the gene A3 is an ortholog to the gene A5 since
they both are the result of the speciation event occurred at
the node N3, while this gene is a paralog to the gene
A1because it is the result of a gene duplication event
occurred after the speciation event at the node N2. How
can we resolve these relationships for hundreds of organisms having thousands of genes? To correctly resolve
orthologs and paralogs, we suggest that clusters of orthologous genes should be defined at each node of the taxonomy tree of organisms. Indeed, if such clusters are
obtained for the tree in Fig. 1, then it will be clearer how
to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the protein family A. At the node N3, the genes A3, A5 will form one independent orthologous group since they were derived from
some ancestral gene A35, and the genes A4, A6 will form
another independent orthologous group since they were
derived from some ancestral gene A46. We can consider
the pairwise alignment built form A3 and A5 as a representative of their ancestral gene A35. The same is true for the
genes A4 and A6. Extending this idea of grouping genes to
represent their ancestors, we can say that at the node N2
the genes A1, A2, A3, A4, A5 and A6 will form their own
independent orthologous group. In this orthologous
group the gene A1 and the orthologous group (A4, A6)
from the node N3 will be orthologs, and the gene A2 and
the orthologous group (A3, A5) from the node N3will be
paralogs.
Our procedure is based on the direct definition of
orthologs and paralogs and utilizes the following idea. If
we have several species with their proteomes at one node
of the taxonomy tree of organims, we can find orthologs
by running a similarity search procedure (e.g. BLAST)
between each pair of species, find bi-directional best hits
(BBHs), and choose orthologs from BBHs using some system of rules. Then it is possible to find paralogs in each
species by finding genes that are not declared orthologs
and which have the statistically significant best hit to an
already found orthologous group. Then we can form a
new "genome", putting into it all orthologous families
and genes that did not find any match. Since this new
"genome" is an artificial construct and it includes all genes
from both species, this new genome is called a supergenome built from protein complements of both species. In
the same way, we can also find orthologs and paralogs
between two supergenomes and build a next level supergenome. Repeating the procedure for all nodes of the tree,
we will eventually obtain the root level supergenome.
Since clusters of orthologous groups are defined at each
node of the taxonomy tree, they are called PHOGs (Phylogenetic Orthologous Groups). A supergenome is a collection of PHOGs accumulated at a particular node of the
taxonomy tree. A supergene is an "ancestral" sequence for
a PHOG.

One connected component contains two orthologous
groups A1A2A3A4 and B1B2B3B4. The false BBH bridge A1B3
connects both orthologous groups.

There are four fundamental differences between our procedure and the earlier procedures to obtain clusters of
orthologous groups [1-4]: (i) our procedure is completely
automated, so it does not require any manual intervention; (ii) our procedure uses evolutionary approach to
detect orthologs and paralogs; (iii) our procedure creates
clusters of orthologous groups at each node of the evolutionary tree and gives clear indication of the timing of
gene duplication events that result in paralogs; (iv) the
time required to run our procedure depends linearly on
the number of genomes.

Construction and content
The basic step in the overall procedure to obtain PHOGs
at all nodes of the evolutionary tree is to compare several
supergenomes, find orthologs and paralogs, put them
into one PHOG and to merge these supergenomes into
the supergenome lying higher in the evolutionary tree.
Since each PHOG represents a multiple alignment of protein sequences, it has first to be converted into an "ancestral" sequence (a supergene), and then consensus
sequences from both supergenomes are compared to find
orthologs and paralogs. Sequences in each newly created
PHOG are multiply aligned, and all PHOGs are then
stored in the relational database to launch the procedure
at next nodes of the evolutionary tree.

Obtaining a supergene from a PHOG multiple alignment
Our accompanying paper [17] shows that each column of
the multiple alignment in more than 98% cases belongs
to one of the 20 frequency column clusters, which can be
thought to be derived from a single amino acid residue.
Rarely, we obtain "garbage' columns which will get the
special symbol "X". We convert a column of the protein
multiple alignment to a frequency vector and find the
nearest cluster as described in our paper [17].
Running PHOG-BLAST
After all PHOGs from supergenomes are converted into
consensus sequences, a special BLAST-like procedure is
run between each pair of supergenomes lying at a single
node of the evolutionary tree which is called PHOGBLAST [17]. PHOG-BLAST combines ideas from FASTA
[18], original BLAST [19] and dynamic programming.

After PHOG-BLAST scores are computed for all possible
pairs of supergenes from each pair of supergenomes, bidirectional best hits are obtained (BBHs). Since BBHs
with low scores can potentially lead to false-positive
orthologs, BBHs with scores less than a given threshold
(100) are discarded. If we form a graph with vertices as
supergenes and BBH relationships as edges we can obtain
connected components in this graph. Fig. 2 shows a connected component in this graph consisting of eight genes.
Genes A1, A2, A3, A4 form one orthologous group and
genes B1, B2, B3, B4 form another orthologous group. Due
to the false BBH bridge between genes A1 and B3, both
orthologous groups are merged into a single orthologous
group. Some of these connected components can be quite
big. For example, when our procedure was run at the
Archaen node (Fig. 3), we frequently obtained connected
components having 60 vertices and more. Since we
believe that each orthologous group is the result of the
node evolution of just one ancestral gene we have to split
this connected component into several parts.
Splitting procedure
Our splitting procedure is based on the assumption that
the higher the BBH score is between a pair of supergenes,
the greater is the chance that these BBH supergenes are
orthologs and they are not false BBH bridges. Therefore,
we are looking for the pair of supergenes in the connected
component with the greatest BBH score, and we consider
this pair as the seed of a new orthologous group. For all
other supergenes in the connected components we calculate a sum of PHOG-BLAST scores to the seeds. Then we
arrange these supergenes in descending order for these
scores. After that we "fill" the growing orthologous group
starting from the top ranking genes in this order and omitting genes that have already representatives in the orthologous group from their taxon. We repeat this procedure
for all genes that are not included in orthologous groups

until we cannot find seeds anymore. As a result of this procedure, the connected component is split into several
orthologous groups, each with its pair of seed supergenes.
To reduce the rate of erroneous assignment of supergenes
to orthologous groups, we reshuffle all supergenes assigning them to those seeds for which they have the maximum
PHOG-BLAST score.
The possible scenario for our procedure for the situation
in Fig. 2 might be like this. A1A2 is the strongest BBH, the
arrangement of other supergenes is A3A4B1B2B3B4, and the
first "filled" orthologous group is A1A2A3A4. From all
BBHs that are not included in this orthologous group,
B1B2 is the strongest BBH, the arrangement of other supergenes is B3B4. The second "filled" orthologous group is
B1B2B3B4. Reshuffling has not changed the composition
of both orthologous groups.
In each orthologous group, the Smith-Waterman algorithm [20] is applied to the seeds. Only seed segments giving the maximum score are left for further processing.
They are called seed cores. A seed consensus sequence is
formed from these cores by finding the nearest frequency
profile cluster in each position of this seed pairwise alignment. Since N/C out-of-core ends of seeds might represent
protein domains, it is very important to look at them once
more. To this end, N/C out-of-core ends having length
greater than 100 are stored in the database and they are
used to launch the second round of the procedure at a single node of the evolutionary tree (see the "Second round"
section below).
Similarly, the Smith-Waterman algorithm is applied to
the seed consensus and all non-seed supergenes to get
non-seed cores. N/C out-of-core ends of non-seeds having
length greater than 100 are stored in the database.
Multiple alignment of core sequences in the orthologous
group
In our earlier experiments with PHOGs we used ClustalW
[21] to multiply align supergene sequences. However, this
approach resulted in a very slow overall procedure. Therefore, we decided to develop our own procedure for the
multiple alignment, following the traditional iterative
approach. The computational experiments showed that
this procedure produced multiple alignments of good
quality (data not shown).

Our alignment procedure is based on the well-known
observation that more similar protein sequences produce
less error prone alignments [22]. The input for our multiple alignment procedure is a set of supergene core
sequences belonging to one orthologous group obtained
at the previous step. The procedure runs as follows:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/52

(i) Compute a sum of PHOG-BLAST scores for non-seed
cores to the seed cores.
(ii) Arrange all core sequences in the descending order for
these scores. Seed cores will head the ordered list.
(iii) Set the consensus sequence equal to the first sequence
in the ordered list.
(iv) Set the current sequence equal to the second sequence
in the ordered list.
(v) Apply the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm [23] to align
the consensus sequence and the current core sequence.
Form the new consensus sequence from this multiple
alignment of the two aligned sequences by finding the
nearest frequency column cluster in each position.
3. Repeat step (v) for all other sequences in the ordered
list.
Finding paralogs
After gene duplications, paralogs experience a period of
relaxed evolution [14], and generally it is difficult to assess
how long this period was. One safe approach to find paralogs is to select those gene as paralogs whose evolutionary distance to an ortholog in its own taxon is smaller
than the distance between orthologs belonging to different taxons [24]. We think, however, that this approach is
too restrictive, and the procedure based on it can result in
too many orphan genes, even these genes have high similarities to other genes that found their counterparts in
other species and fell into PHOGs.

Therefore, for all supergenes that are not declared
orthologs at a particular node of the evolutionary tree, we
compute PHOG-BLAST scores to PHOG supergenes and
for each such supergene we find the best hit. If the PHOGBLAST score to this consensus exceeds 100, we declare this
supergene to be a paralog to the best-hit PHOG. After all
paralogs are added to PHOGs, PHOGs are aligned as
described in the previous section.
Second round of the procedure
This round is needed because orthologs can have different
domain structures due to gene fusion events. If both
orthologs have a homologous core, but the first ortholog
has an additional domain that is absent in the second
ortholog, then we can cut out this additional domain.
This additional domain can find its match among other
domains or orphan genes in other supergenomes. Therefore, all previous steps are repeated for all N/C cuts and all
orphan genes at a particular node.

Utility
The PHOG database can be used in various areas of comparative genomics, such as studying the evolution of protein function, finding proteins specific to a particular
group of organisms, determining protein fusions and protein domain structure, functional annotation of
sequenced genomes.

Discussion
The procedure has been applied to the tree of organisms
shown at Fig. 3. Proteomes for these species were downloaded from the NCBI ftp site [25]. 51367 PHOGs were
obtained at the root node of the tree including 36903
PHOGs that consisted of only one gene (orphan genes).
14464 PHOGs contained at least two protein sequences.
Table 1 shows several key values for the nodes leading
from Escherichia coli O157 to the Universal Common
Ancestor. As we move from lower nodes to upper nodes,
the number of PHOGs per node sharply rises, while the
number of ancestral PHOGs is stable within the range
from 2000 to 5000 PHOGs. At any node, ancestral
PHOGs form a subset of all PHOGs available at that node.
By definition, they are PHOGs that contain two or more
PHOGs from its child nodes that were declared as
orthologs and possibly some PHOGs from its child nodes
that were declared as paralogs. The supergenes for these
PHOGs can be thought as ancestral genes belonging to
some hypothetical ancestral organism that gave rise to all
taxonomy groups lying lower in the taxonomy tree. Nodespecific PHOGs consist of all ancestral PHOGs that did
not find their match during the procedure run for all
nodes lying higher in the taxonomy tree.
All ancestral PHOGs that are not node-specific could be
considered as a result of vertical evolution from some
PHOGs lying higher in the taxonomy tree. The evolution
of node-specific PHOGs is an evolutionary mystery. For
the nodes corresponding to currently living organisms,
node-specific PHOGs are usually called orphan gene.

three reasons why a gene can become orphan: (i) the gene
is newly evolved; (ii) the gene was lost in most evolutionary lineages; (iii) the gene evolves very quickly. The ratio
of the number of paralogs to the number of ancestral
PHOGs (Np/Na) is within the range from 0.15 to 0.8 suggesting that gene duplications and gene losses probably
played a major role in the evolution of life. During the
early stages of evolution of Life on Earth gene duplications
and the formation of node-specific genes happened on a
larger scale than during the later stages of evolution. Take,
for example two nodes: Bacteria and Escherichia. For bacteria Np/Na is 0.64, whereas for Escherichia this ratio is
only 0.166. The number of node-specific PHOGs is 2079
for Bacteria and only 161 for Escherichia. Clearly, to create
a new taxon such as Bacteria nature had to evolve more
new genes than to create such a taxon as Escherichia from
a closely related ancestral taxon.
We used the COG database [27] to test our procedure as
the most complete database of orthologous group available today. Since this database also contains protein
sequences for most organisms from our tree, we matched
protein sequences in our database against the COG database. Each matched protein sequence obtained a number
corresponding to the number of the COG where this
sequence was found. 14464 non-orphan PHOGs contained 83450 thus matched protein sequences. Each such
PHOG obtained a COG number corresponding to the biggest number of protein sequences from this COG in this
PHOG. Sequences whose COG numbers were different
from COG numbers of their PHOGs were counted with
the total count of 2472. Thus, we obtained the mismatch
rate about 3%. This test proves that our procedure basically results in the same clusters of orthologous groups,
though the composition of corresponding COGs and
PHOGs can be somewhat different due to the great
amount of statistical material and ambiguities of the evolution of protein families. For each COG there is a corresponding PHOG. The number of PHOGs is, however, five
times greater than the number of COGs in the COG data-

base. There are two main reasons for that. First, COGs that
contain fusion proteins are split into several PHOGs containing their domains. Second, since the procedure that
underlies the COG database [1] uses the triangle pattern
of BBHs, it might not include clusters of orthologous
groups that arise at lower level of the taxonomy tree. For
example, at the Escherichia coli node of the taxonomy tree
we detected 432 orphan PHOGs that contained genes
only from two closely related strains: Escherichia coli O157
and Escherichia coli K12. Obviously, these PHOGs did not
have their counterparts in the COG database.
The PHOG database provides a possible evolutionary scenario for the evolution of a particular PHOG. If a PHOG
consists of orthologs only, then we do need to care about
gene duplications. If a PHOG contains paralogs, the
PHOG database indicates the probable timing interval of
gene duplication events for all PHOGs that contain paralogs. Consider, for example, PHOG16006. Its possible
evolutionary scenario is shown in Fig. 4. The gene
TM1698 from Thermotoga maritima is a paralog at the Bacteria node of the taxonomy tree. Therefore, it is, possibly,
the result of a gene duplication event occurred anywhere
during the evolutionary process from the ancestor of Bacteria to modern Thermotoga maritima. Since PHOG16006
does not contain an ortholog from Thermotoga maritima at
the Bacteria node, we can assume that this gene was lost.
The gene YP_152563 from Salmonella paratyphi and the
gene NP_807545 from Salmonella typhi (putative aminotransferases) form an orthologous group at the Salmonella node of the taxonomy tree. At the Enterobacteriales
node, this orthologous group becomes a paralog, with a
duplication event occurred somewhere between the
Enterobacteriales node and the Salmonella node. The
gene NP_805259 (putative aminotransferase) of Salmonella typhi is also a paralog at the Enterobacteriales node,
but it lacks its ortholog at the Salmonella node, because it
was probably lost.
The average length of the root level supergene is 310
amino acids, which corresponds approximately to two
protein domains. As the procedure goes from the leaves to
the root of the evolutionary tree, protein sequences are
truncated to leave the most conserved evolutionary cores.
There is always a possibility that cores can be truncated to
such extent that they cannot be used anymore for resolving orthologs and paralogs. The remarkable fact about the
root level PHOGs is that their lengths are not seriously
shortened. This observation leads us to the startling proposal that the core determine the general function for the
protein family in one PHOG and protein N/C ends determine species-specific behavior.
An interesting feature of the PHOG database is that it provides a built-in capability to detect fusion events and the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/52

multidomain structure of proteins due to its N/C cuts each
time when the domain structure of orthologous groups is
different. Therefore, it will be more correct to call the
PHOG database as a database of orthologous domains.
We can give several examples. COG1526 is split into two
PHOGs: PHOG722 and PHOG51085. These two PHOGs
contain possible domains of fusion proteins that exist as
single entities in the COG database. For example, the gene
VC1519 of Vibrio cholera is only included in COG1526,
whereas in the PHOG database its possible domains are
present in PHOG722 and PHOG51085. We also detected
fusion proteins for COG1217 (it is split into PHOG30
and PHOG34) and COG60 (it is split into PHOG39 and
PHOG50466). A striking example is COG1674. It is split
into six PHOGs. The protein BH0975 (unknown conserved protein) from Bacillus halodurans is present in all
these PHOGs indicating that it consists of at least 6
domains, while it is present only in COG1674 in the COG
database. We used the CDD database [28] to verify the
domain structure of BH0975. This database refers to four
conserved domains: CDD:11385 (DNA segregation
ATPase), CDD:25783 (putative ATP binding P-loop
motif), CDD:25783 (putative ATP binding P-loop motif)
and CDD:25783 (putative ATP binding P-loop motif).
The PHOG database finds two additional putative
domains at the N/C ends of the protein. These domains
are conserved only between two closely related species:
Bacillus halodurans and Bacillus subtilis. This observation
also supports the idea that protein N/C ends determine
species-specific behavior.
We used the NCBI taxonomy tree [29] as the tree that controls the flow of our procedure from the leaves of the tree
to its root. No one tree can be absolutely perfect, and there
can be ambiguities and errors in assigning organisms to
taxonomy groups. When changing the assignment of a
particular organism to a different node of the tree, the
composition of the PHOGs at affected lower levels of the
tree will be slightly different reflecting this new assignment. However, at higher nodes of the tree the composition of PHOGs will be the same, since BBH relationships
undiscovered at lower nodes will be rediscovered at
higher nodes. We can give the following example. Earlier
we mentioned 432 orphan PHOGs detected at the
Escherichia coli node of the taxonomy tree. If we move
Escherichia coli O157 to another node, say the Salmonella
node, then these 432 orphan PHOGs will be rediscovered
at the Enterobacteriales node of tree.

Conclusion
The computer procedure that was used to build the PHOG
database can take any number of sequences genomes with
predicted protein sequences to build orthologous groups.
This opens new vistas for studying protein evolution.
Using this database the researcher can compare not only

complements belonging to the whole taxonomic groups.
We expect that the PHOG database will be useful in our
efforts to understand such evolutionary phenomena as
horizontal transfer, the existence of orphans genes, gene
losses and gene acquisitions.
