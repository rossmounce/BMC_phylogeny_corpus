Abstract
Background: In Germany, measles vaccination coverage with two doses is not yet sufficient to prevent regional
outbreaks. Among the 16 German federal states, vaccination coverage was lowest in Bavaria with 85% in 2008.
From March to mid-April 2008, four neighbouring Bavarian counties reported 55 measles-cases mostly linked to an
ongoing measles outbreak in an anthroposophic school in Austria. We investigated this outbreak to guide future
public health action.
Methods: We applied the German national case-definition for measles and collected data using the national
surveillance system and a questionnaire. Measles cases with disease onset a maximum of 18 days apart and spatial
contact (e.g. same household, same school) were summed up in clusters. Two different interventions, which were
implemented in schools and kindergartens in Bavaria, were compared by their impact on the size and duration of
measles clusters. Susceptible persons were excluded from schools or kindergartens either with the first
(intervention A) or second (intervention B) measles case occurring in the respective institution.
Results: Among the 217 Bavarian measles cases identified from March-July 2008, 28 (13%) cases were attendees of
the anthroposophic school in Austria. In total, vaccination status was known in 161 (74%) cases and 156 (97%) of
them were not vaccinated. The main factor for non-vaccination was “fear of vaccine-related adverse events” (33%).
Twenty-nine (18%) of 161 cases suffered complications. Exclusively genotype D5 was detected. Overall, 184 cases
could be epidemiologically grouped into 59 clusters. Of those, 41 clusters could be linked to households and 13 to
schools or kindergartens. The effect of intervention A and B was analysed in 10 school or kindergarten clusters.
Depending on the respective intervention A or B, the median number of cases per cluster was 3 versus 13 (p =
0.05), and the median duration of a cluster was 3 versus 26 days (p = 0.13).
Conclusions: Introduction of measles virus into a pocket of susceptible persons (e.g. vaccination opponents or
sceptics) may lead to large outbreaks in the general population, if the general population’s vaccination coverage is
below the WHO recommended level. Education on the safety of measles vaccine needs to be strengthened to increase
measles vaccination coverage. Early intervention may limit spread in schools or kindergartens. Suspected measles has to
be reported immediately to the local health authorities in order to allow intervention as early as possible.

Background
Infection with measles virus is potentially severe and the
leading cause of vaccine-preventable childhood mortality
worldwide. Humans are the only reservoir, and treatment is only symptomatic. The incubation period is
about 10 days, and ranges between 7 and 18 days from
exposure to onset of fever; rarely, it is as long as 19-21

days. The period of contagiousness is usually 4 days
before and after onset of rash [1]. Results from recent
outbreak investigations in Austria, Germany and Switzerland showed, that measles disease mostly affected
persons 10 years and older [2-4].
The WHO aims to eliminate measles in the WHO
European region by 2015 [5]. One indicator for measles
elimination would be an incidence of < 0.1 cases per
100,000 inhabitants.
In Germany, measles is a notifiable disease. The median annual incidence between 2003 and 2007 was 0.9

cases per 100,000 inhabitants, and the lowest incidence
in this time period was reported in 2004 with 0.2/
100,000. Incidence rose to 2.8/100,000 in 2006, due to a
large outbreak with 1749 notified cases [6].
High protection rates are achieved after two doses of
measles vaccine. Vaccine effectiveness after two doses of
measles vaccine in two outbreak settings was 95% and
99% [4,7]. In order to prevent outbreaks, a measles vaccine coverage for two doses of 95% is needed [8]. The
German Standing Committee on Vaccination (STIKO)
recommends the first dose of measles vaccine to all children at 11-14 months of age and a second dose at 15-23
months of age.
Coverage can vary by subgroups for medical, religious,
philosophical or personal reasons [9].
In 2008, vaccination coverage of first graders for two
doses of measles vaccine was 89% (range: 85-94%) in
Germany. Among the 16 federal states, the lowest vaccination coverage (85%) was reported in Bavaria [10].
Outbreak background

At the end of March 2008, physicians notified 15 persons with measles disease residing in two neighbouring
Bavarian counties to the respective local health authorities. Of those, 14 attended an Austrian anthroposophic
school with an ongoing measles outbreak since the
beginning of March [3,11]. The affected German counties share a border with Austria, hence regular school
attendance in areas across the border is not unusual.
The Austrian outbreak investigation team found a 34%
(101 of 294) coverage with at least one dose of measles
vaccine among students attending the anthroposophic
school in Salzburg city [3]. Other investigations in European countries had already yielded, that immunisation
against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) was lower
in students attending anthroposophic schools than in
those attending non-anthroposophic schools [12][13].
Hence, these students may form a pocket of susceptible
persons.
Until mid-April 2008, the number of measles cases
possibly related to the outbreak in the Austrian school
increased to 55, affecting the population of four neighbouring Bavarian counties. Between 2001 and 2007, a
median of seven measles cases per year had been notified in the four counties. The average vaccination coverage of first graders for two doses of measles vaccine in
the four counties was 69% (range 64-72%) in 2006/2007.
We report about the outbreak investigation, which was
initiated to describe the public health implications of
the measles outbreak in Bavaria, to explore the reasons
for non-vaccination and to compare the effect of implemented control measures in order to guide future public
health action.

Methods
Data collection and descriptive analysis

Measles is a notifiable disease in Germany. Physicians
must report any suspected case, clinical cases of and
deaths from measles within 24 hours to the responsible
local health authority. Heads of laboratories are obliged
to report any direct or indirect evidence of measles
virus — if the evidence suggests an acute infection within 24 hours to the responsible local health authority.
The German local health authorities routinely collect
case based data, e.g. on demographics, clinical symptoms, hospitalisation, vaccination status, travel history
and laboratory testing. Contact tracing is also performed
as a standard procedure. Local health authorities of two
Bavarian counties accepted self reporting of the vaccination status by patients while the other two Bavarian
counties requested verification by physicians or health
inspectors. In this outbreak investigation, we defined a
case as any resident of the four affected Bavarian counties (Berchtesgadener Land, Rosenheim, Traunstein,
Mühldorf am Inn), diagnosed with clinical measles and
disease onset between February 1 and August 30, 2008.
Clinical measles was defined as a generalised maculopapular rash persisting for at least 3 days, fever ≥ 38.5°
C, and at least one of the four following symptoms: conjunctivitis, cough, runny nose or Koplik’s spots. Cases
were further categorized as having a link with the Austrian outbreak or not. We considered “attending school
in Austria”, “visiting Salzburg city” or “having contact
with a measles case from Salzburg city” during the incubation period as potential links to the Austrian
outbreak.
Cases were notified by physicians and laboratories to
the respective local health authority (LHA) which
entered the information into the electronic surveillance
system. Additionally, the LHA collected data on reasons
for non-immunization and complications from all notified cases through a questionnaire administered by telephone or post. If patients were under age 16, parents
were queried. Study participation was voluntary. We
assumed implicit informed consent when a completed
questionnaire was returned. Information on non-responders was available.
We used EpiData software version 3 (EpiData Association, Odense, Denmark) for double data entry, and Stata
(Stata Statistical Software: Release 10, Texas, USA) for
descriptive analysis.
Laboratory analysis

Laboratory confirmation using serology was performed
by regional laboratories. The National Reference Centre
for Measles, Mumps and Rubella in Berlin (NRC) used
the Enzygnost Anti-Measles Virus IgM ELISA (Siemens,

Wadl et al. BMC Public Health 2011, 11:474
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/11/474

Germany) for the detection of anti-measles IgM in
serum. A subset of samples was genotyped by the NRC
according to the WHO recommendation for measles
virus [14]. As described in Santibanez et al., 2002 [15],
viral RNA was extracted from urine or throat swab specimens and reversely transcribed into cDNA. A C-terminal 450 nt fragment corresponding to the hypervariable
150 aa of the N-protein of measles virus was amplified
by PCR and subsequently sequenced. The sequences
were phylogenetically analysed.

mode of intervention did not differ) were excluded from
analysis.
We compared the median number of cases per cluster
and the median duration of clusters in days according
to the implemented intervention using the Mann-Whitney-U-Test. Using a Poisson regression model we estimated the average decline of cases per 7-day interval.
We categorized the days of disease onsets in 7-day
intervals, starting with the onset of the second case in
clusters with intervention A and of the third case in
clusters with intervention B as day 1.

Clusters and applied control measures

Cases with disease onset a maximum of 18 days apart
and spatial contact (e.g. same household, same school)
were grouped into clusters.
In Germany, the LHAs are responsible for the implementation of control measures. In order to assess the
effectiveness of implemented control measures, the
Robert Koch Institute interviewed the LHAs by telephone. Our interviews of the local health authorities
revealed that they applied two different control measures in schools and kindergartens (preschool) during
the outbreak: the trigger for exclusion of non-immune
persons from the respective school or kindergarten for
14 days after the last contact to an infectious case was
either the notification of at least one measles case (intervention A) or at least two measles cases (intervention B)
in the respective school or kindergarten. Immune persons were those with at least one documented vaccination against measles a minimum of three weeks before
disease onset, immunity confirmed by serology or anamnestic measles. Intervention A and B were implemented compulsory. Compliance was not controlled for.
Vaccination cards in schools and kindergartens were
checked by staff from the LHAs in three of the affected
counties, and by staff from the respective school or kindergarten in the fourth county.
Attack rates were calculated and negative binomial
regression was used to estimate the average attack rate
ratio with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) according
to the implemented measure. Teachers and staff of
schools and kindergartens were not included in the
denominators of the specific institutions.
In order to analyse the effect of the respective intervention we excluded the case with the first disease onset
from all clusters in which intervention A was applied
and the two cases with the first disease onsets from all
clusters where intervention B was used. The duration of
clusters by intervention was calculated starting with the
onset of the respective intervention. The school cluster
in the anthroposophic school in Salzburg city (since
Austrian health authorities were responsible for the
intervention) and clusters in kindergartens and schools
with all cases occurring on the same day (0 days apart,

Results
Outbreak description

From 14 March to 15 July (calendar weeks 11-29) 2008,
we identified 217 measles cases in the four counties. No
case was found in teachers or staff of schools and kindergartens. In the outbreak period, the four counties
had an average measles incidence of 32 cases per
100,000 population (range: 12-71) which was the highest
among all Bavarian counties (overall: 2 cases per
100,000 population, Figure 1). Six weeks before and
after the outbreak period, no other measles case was
reported within the four counties. For the 215 measles
cases with available information on date of onset and
date of reporting the mean reporting delay was 6 days
(range: 0-28 days); the reporting delay did not differ
among the four counties.
Fifty-one cases (24%) could be linked to the ongoing
measles outbreak in Austria. Among those, 28 attended
the same anthroposophic school in Salzburg city. All
linked cases occurred in the first seven weeks of the

outbreak. Case numbers peaked in May, with 28 and 27
cases respectively in week 19 and 21. After that, case
numbers decreased continuously (Figure 2).
The median age of cases was 11 years (range: 0-57),
47% were male. The incidence rate was highest in persons aged 10-14 years (170 cases/100,000 person-years),
followed by those 0-4 years (150/100,000) and 5-9 years
(140/100,000) of age (Figure 3).
Overall, 25 of 217 (11%) cases were hospitalised for a
median of four days (range: 1-13 days). The hospitalised
patients had a median age of 16 years in contrast to 10
years for the non-hospitalized group (p = 0.001).
Of the 217 cases, 161 (74%) responded to the questionnaire. The non-responder analysis revealed geographic differences: while one county managed a
response of 100%, the others achieved 56%, 60% and
62% (P < 0.001). The non-responders did not differ
regarding age, sex, vaccination status or epidemiological
link to Austria.
Twenty-nine cases (18%) of 161 developed complications; most frequently, otitis media was reported (n =
14). A 13-year-old girl, who was hospitalised for five
days, suffered from seizures (Table 1).
Overall, 156 (97%) of 161 measles cases filling in the
questionnaire were unvaccinated. Four persons had

received one measles vaccine dose, one patient two
doses. All vaccinations had been applied at least one
year before symptom onset.
The main reasons for not being vaccinated against
measles were “fear of vaccine-related adverse events”
(33%), “opposing measles vaccination in general” (30%)
and the opinion “measles is not a severe disease” (18%)
(Table 2).

Laboratory analysis

In total, 54 (25%) of 217 cases were laboratory confirmed by serology. Two of the five vaccinated persons,
including the patient vaccinated twice were among the
confirmed cases. Virus isolates from 28 cases were genotyped. In two cases, sequencing of the viral genome was
not successful, while in the remaining 26 cases, identical
sequences revealing genotype D5 were detected. This
virus variant was found in all four counties and included
patients with and those without links to Austria.
Clusters and effect of differently applied control
measures in schools and kindergartens

A total of 184 (85%) cases could be epidemiologically
grouped to 59 clusters. These could be linked to 41
households, 13 schools or kindergartens, four hospitals
or medical practices and one firemen’s festival (Table 3).
A total of 32 cases were linked to the use of a school
bus which carried children and teenagers to and from
three of the affected schools. However, all cases linked
with the school bus were included in the respective
school clusters.
Overall, we included 10 clusters, three in kindergartens and seven in schools, with 85 cases altogether from
all four counties for the comparison of the effect of
intervention A and B (Table 4). Two schools had

authorities recommended intervention A during six
clusters (28 cases) and intervention B during four clusters (57 cases), based on their own decision.
Three counties implemented solely intervention A.
The fourth county used intervention B until calendar
week 22 (12 weeks) and intervention A since calendar
week 23 (7 weeks, Figure 2). The county using intervention B informed as early as the occurrence of the first
incident measles case in a kindergarten or school all
contact persons about the incident measles case and the
necessity of protection by vaccination.
Both, the attack rates as well as the average attack rate
ratios were calculated but should be interpreted with caution since the population at risk (number of susceptible
contacts per school or kindergarten) was not available:
The mean attack rate in institutions was 2.7%. Stratification by intervention led to a mean attack rate of 1.9%
(range: 1-16%) if intervention A was used and 3.3% (range:
1-21%) if intervention B was applied. Average attack rate
ratios in institutions where intervention A was implemented were 1.6 times lower (95% CI: 0.4-6.1) than those of
institutions where intervention B was applied.
For the following analyses - as described in the methods section - we neither counted the first case of clusters A nor the first two cases of clusters B; furthermore,
the calculation of the cluster duration in days started
with the first day of the respective intervention.
Clusters in kindergartens and schools had a median
number of 3 (intervention A; range: 1-7) versus 13
(intervention B; range: 2-21) cases (p = 0.05), and lasted
a median of 3 (intervention A; range: 0-36) versus 26
(intervention B; range: 3-66) days (p = 0.13).
The estimated mean decrease of cases per 7-day interval was 58% using intervention A and 29% intervention
B, indicating that the average number of cases per 7-day
interval decreased 1.7 times (95% confidence interval:
1.1-2.7; p = 0.03) slower using intervention B compared
to intervention A (Figure 4).

possible any suspected measles case has to be reported
without delay.
In this outbreak investigation, most cases were not
vaccinated against measles. The reasons for not being
vaccinated among cases indicate that parents lack
knowledge about the true risks associated with vaccination or with non-vaccination, as described in other European studies [9,16,17]. Internationally available measles
vaccines are regarded as safe and effective [18], and only
minor adverse effects have been reported with measles
vaccine [19,20].
Studies have shown that an increase in knowledge and
a change in behaviours can be achieved through awareness campaigns [21,22]. Health professionals should use
all opportunities (e.g. contact with patients), both to
inform about the highly protective effect of measles vaccinations and to offer measles vaccination to persons,
who are not yet immunized.
The relatively high median age at infection was probably the consequence of a partially immunized population, which leads to a reduced rate of virus circulation
and thus raises the age at which persons get infected.
Higher age of measles cases may lead to more serious
diseases [23] which is reflected in a higher proportion of
hospitalisations among older cases than younger cases
in our study. A considerable percentage of cases (18%)
in our study reported complications, including one case
that had seizures. This indicates that measles is not a
mild disease.
The measles virus genotype D5 detected in this outbreak was identical to the one causing an outbreak in
Austria at the same time. This supports the link to

Wadl et al. BMC Public Health 2011, 11:474
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/11/474

Austria, which was also found in the epidemiological
investigations.
Schmid and colleagues reported that the primary case
of the outbreak in Austria came from Switzerland; the
genotype circulating in Austria was the same as in our
findings and was indistinguishable from the outbreak
strain in Switzerland [3].
The high number of clusters in households and institutions such as schools or kindergartens underlines the
infectiousness of the measles virus. The compared attack
rates should be interpreted with caution since the number of persons who were already immune against measles
was not available for the population at risk in the respective institutions. Therefore, we can assume that the calculated attack rates are rather underestimates.
The differently applied control measures in schools
and kindergartens offered us a unique opportunity to
study the effect of early interventions in this measles
outbreak. The mean number of cases and duration per
cluster indicated that exclusion of susceptible persons
from schools and kindergartens starting with the first
incident measles case (intervention A) might be more
effective than exclusion of susceptible persons after the
second case (intervention B). However, only the comparison of the median number of cases per cluster
showed borderline statistically significant results, if
accepting an alpha-error-level of 0.05. We did not use
the calculated attack rates and mean attack rate ratios
as basis to assess the effectiveness of the respective
interventions, since the population at risk (number of
susceptible contacts per school or kindergarten) was not
sufficiently available. Intervention A is also recommended by a guideline from the German federal state of
Lower Saxony [24]. Measles have a high basic reproduction number (R0 12-18) and contacts among school and
kindergarten attendees are frequent. Therefore, it is biologically plausible that early intervention will be more
successful, which is supported by our observations. To
start intervention as early as possible, suspected measles
cases have to be immediately notified by physicians to
the health authorities. The detected reporting delay
might have influenced the outcome of the control
measures.
This study had some limitations. First, case finding
was based on the reporting of primary care physicians
to the LHA which possibly underestimated the extent of
the outbreak. Active case finding was limited to contacts
of notified measles cases.
Second, interviews were either done by telephone or
by self-administered questionnaires, so interviewer bias
could have been present. We tried to counter that by
the use of a standardized questionnaire.
Third, information on the population at risk (number
of susceptible contacts per school or kindergarten) was

not sufficiently available. Therefore, attack rates were
compared among all children and/or teenagers attending
the affected schools and kindergartens.
Last, the duration of the school and kindergarten clusters may also depend on the number of cases and hence
of attendees in each institution.

Conclusions
This outbreak investigation shows that once the measles
virus has found its way into a low-immunized population like an anthroposophic community, the general
population — if having vaccination coverage below the
WHO recommended level, such as in Bavaria - is at risk
of measles outbreaks. Furthermore, early isolation of
non-immune persons might limit the size and duration
of clusters in schools and kindergartens effectively.
Uncertainty about the safety of measles vaccine and
underestimation of the risks of the disease has contributed to the low coverage of measles vaccination. In order
to improve the overall vaccination coverage, we recommend awareness campaigns targeting health professionals and parents. Physicians and parents should be
informed about the true risks associated with vaccination compared with non-vaccination. Moreover, health
professionals have to be convinced that immediate notification of suspected measles cases to the health authorities is important for timely infection control measures.
The early intervention method should be considered in
future outbreaks, particularly if a population with moderate vaccination coverage is affected.
