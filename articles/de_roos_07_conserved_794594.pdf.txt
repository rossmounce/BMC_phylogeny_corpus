Abstract
Background: The timing of the origin of introns is of crucial importance for an understanding of
early genome architecture. The Exon theory of genes proposed a role for introns in the formation
of multi-exon proteins by exon shuffling and predicts the presence of conserved splice sites in
ancient genes. In this study, large-scale analysis of potential conserved splice sites was performed
using an intron-exon database (ExInt) derived from GenBank.
Results: A set of conserved intron positions was found by matching identical splice sites sequences
from distantly-related eukaryotic kingdoms. Most amino acid sequences with conserved introns
were homologous to consensus sequences of functional domains from conserved proteins
including kinases, phosphatases, small GTPases, transporters and matrix proteins. These included
ancient proteins that originated before the eukaryote-prokaryote split, for instance the catalytic
domain of protein phosphatase 2A where a total of eleven conserved introns were found. Using an
experimental setup in which the relation between a splice site and the ancientness of its
surrounding sequence could be studied, it was found that the presence of an intron was positively
correlated to the ancientness of its surrounding sequence. Intron phase conservation was linked to
the conservation of the gene sequence and not to the splice site sequence itself. However, no
apparent differences in phase distribution were found between introns in conserved versus nonconserved sequences.
Conclusion: The data confirm an origin of introns deep in the eukaryotic branch and is in
concordance with the presence of introns in the first functional protein modules in an 'Exon theory
of genes' scenario. A model is proposed in which shuffling of primordial short exonic sequences led
to the formation of the first functional protein modules, in line with hypotheses that see the
formation of introns integral to the origins of genome evolution.

Background
The question about the origin of introns is fundamental
for an understanding of the evolution of the genome. Historically, there have been two opposite camps that try to
explain the origin of introns (see [1-4]). The 'introns early'

school stated that introns arose in ancient genes and were
subsequently lost in prokaryotes [5,6], while the 'introns
late theory' maintained that the spliceosomal introns were
inserted in the eukaryotic lineage into primordial continuous protein-coding regions [2,7-11]. The introns-early

theory has been modified to include the insertion of
introns later in evolution, while maintaining the role of
early introns in creating protein diversity [12-14]. Proponents of both introns-early and introns-late now agree
that spliceosomal introns and the spliceosome already
existed in the most recent common ancestor of living
eukaryotes [15]. Thus, the debate of the timing of the origin of introns has shifted to an origin before or after the
prokaryote-eukaryote split. However, even in an introns
early scenario, the question remains if and how introns
were inserted into genes, since the origin of introns is
intricately connected to the evolution of the spliceosome.
Also, introns-first hypotheses have been proposed that do
not assume intron insertion, but trace introns to the very
early origins of the genome [16-18], and position the origin of the spliceosome directly to the first generation of
multiexon genes.
In all introns-early scenarios, one would expect the presence of conserved introns between orthologous proteins
that diverged before the eukaryotic lineage. There have
been studies that used phylogenetic comparisons in an
attempt to show that intron position is conserved and
therefore ancient (for review see [2,15,19]). Many introns
were found in homologous positions in genes duplicated
before the separation of bacteria and eukaryotes [20-23].
Also, it has been estimated that up to one-third [21-23] of
modern-day introns are shared between at least two major
eukaryotic kingdoms. Although the frequency of gain of
introns during evolution is still a matter of debate [24-26],
it is probable that extensive loss of introns has occurred in
the course of evolution. Presently, consensus seems to be
that at least some introns were present in the last common
eukaryotic ancestor and others were gained later in evolution (for recent reviews see [27,28]). However, the exact
timing of the origin of introns before or after the eukaryote-prokaryote split remains a matter of debate.
The formation of multimodular proteins by exon shuffling [6,29] has been proposed to be a possible functional
role for ancient (i.e. present before the eukaryote-prokaryote split) introns. The 'Exon theory of genes' proposes that
ancient introns would have aided in the creation of early
protein diversity by providing the actual sites of recombination in the process of exon shuffling [30-32], and could
have aided in creating the first functional protein modules. The functional role of introns may not be limited to
shuffling entire domains, but may also have been responsible for the generation of the modules themselves.
Recently, a similar scenario has been proposed in a mechanistic reconstruction of the origin of splicing which
placed the evolution of the spliceosome at the origin of
exon concatenation and shuffling [18]. Other introns-first
hypotheses have been proposed in which intronic catalytic RNA introns predated exons [17] or where introns

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/7

were formed in the early recombination process that
involved splicing [16]. However, it has proven difficult to
find supporting experimental evidence for an ancient origin of introns.
Support for a functional role of introns in exon shuffling
has come from the distribution of intron phase and the
excess of symmetrical internal exons, [12,33] proposed to
facilitate shuffling between same-phase introns. Also,
intron-exon boundaries show a correlation with threedimensional structure of protein modules [12,34-36].
However, it is still uncertain whether or not ancient
eukaryotic multi-domain protein tend to contain introns
between the domains (see [28]). A further substantiation
of the occurrence of introns in proteins that arose before
the prokaryote-eukaryote split and the possible role of
introns in exon shuffling or protein domain formation is
therefore warranted. In this study, the hypothesis that
introns originated in ancient (before the prokaryoteeukaryote split) genes and played a role in exon shuffling
or protein domain formation, was further explored.
A large-scale search was performed that identified conserved introns and which allowed the gene sequence that
harboured these introns to be studied. It was also found
that the presence of an intron is positively correlated to
the ancientness of its surrounding exon sequence, suggesting a role for ancient exons as the building blocks of the
early protein modules.

Results
A set of potential ancient splice sites
An experimental set-up was defined that allowed for a systematic search for potential conserved splice sites in a
genomic intron-exon database derived from GenBank
(ExInt; [37]). A conserved splice site was defined as an
amino acid sequence that has the same intron position
and splice site sequence in two distantly-related protein
sequences (Fig. 1A). With this bioinformatics approach,
each potential match will be found, no matter how many
other non-conserved introns are in the database. To
ensure that selected proteins diverged close to the root of
the eukaryotic tree, only matches were allowed between
two of the following kingdoms: Protists, Fungi, Animals
and Plants. This setup was translated into a database SQL
query where a reconstructed 10-residue splice site was
compared to all other splice junctions in the database
(Fig. 1B). Sequences that shared an intron at the same
amino acid position from different eukaryotic kingdoms
with at least 6 identical residues from the 10-amino acid
splice site region were selected. It was found that the combination of a 6 out of 10 identical residues around a common splice site selected mostly for sequences that also
showed sequence similarity further removed from the
splice sites (Fig. 1C), indicating that these sequences were

as i) homologous exon gene sequences that ii) shared an
intron position and iii) were from different taxa that split
near the root of the Eukaryotic Tree. The actual splice site
sequence was derived from concatenating subsequent exons
(exon x and exon x+1, where x is exon number) using SQL
and performing a full database scan. B. A sequence of 10 residues around the intron position was taken (5 pre-intron and
5 post-intron) as the splice site (in red), while a further homology was determined up- and downstream of the intron
(each 10 residues; in black). For a conserved intron, at least
6/10 splice site residues should match and a further 6 matching residues in the 20 residues up- and downstream. C.

homologous. Sequences that did not show at least 6 more
identical residues from the 20 residues that were located
further away from the intron were discarded as possible
false-positives due to a chance match on splice site similarity. This resulted in a set of putative conserved splice
sites between (co-)orthologous protein domains.
Based on the method shown above, homologous
sequences were identified with an identical intron position relative to the amino acids sequence. Figure 2 shows
some examples of the conserved splice sites that were
found. The entire set of conserved genes with a shared

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/7

intron position set used comprised 459 putative conserved introns [see additional file 1] shared between
eukaryotic kingdoms (Plants, Animals, Fungi, and Protists). Strongly homologous sequences from the same
kingdom combinations where removed (e.g. the gpc2
gene of Zea and the GapC gene of Arabidopsis both share
an intron with the Human GAPDH2 gene but its
sequences are very similar), further reducing the set to 251
putative conserved introns (see additional file 'deroosconserved sets.zip'). The intron phase was identical in
almost all of the matching sequences found (218/251 =
87%), showing that these sequences shared the exact ribonucleotide splice site relative to the amino acid sequence.
This indicates the non-random occurrence of introns position in the selected genes, as expected for conserved
introns. Most (83%) of conserved splice site sequences
could be found in the conserved domain database at
NCBI. Some sequences with conserved introns were represented by three eukaryotic kingdoms, and these included
phosphatases, kinases, small GTPases (Rab, Rho), ubiquitin, triosephosphate isomerase, alcohol dehydrogenase
and actin. Most of these genes can be considered to have
existed before the eukaryote-prokaryote split, showing
that the selection method can positively identify conserved splice sites in ancient genes. Thus, based on the
broad phylogenetic distribution of the set of splice sites
and the conserved intron phase, the selected sequences
can be considered to be potential conserved splice sites.
Shared introns in ancient protein domains
The names of the genes and the observed conservation of
the sequences already suggested a common function of
the sequences involved (cf. Fig. 2), as expected for conserved introns. Searching the conserved domain database
(CDD) at NCBI revealed that these sequences with putative conserved introns could almost all be matched to the
consensus sequence of conserved domains. The CDD
includes a consensus sequence of the domains and these
were used to map the different splice site sequences to
these domains. Multiple conserved introns were found in
some conserved protein domains and conserved introns
were sometimes represented in three different taxa. Three
conserved splice sites were found in a 30-residue long part
of the serine/threonine kinase domain, while four conserved splice sites were found in the Rab-domain. Figure 3
shows the mapping of some of the conserved splice sites
to the consensus sequence of the conserved domains of
serine/threonine kinase (CDD entry number cd00180; A)
and Rab related genes (cd00154; B). The largest number
of conserved splice sites was found in the consensus
sequence of the catalytic domain of protein phosphatases
2, comprising a large family of serine/threonine phosphatases (Fig. 4). In this ancient phosphatase domain of
300 nucleotides, 11 conserved splice sites were found,
each with an identical intron phase (position relative to

of 10 residues were similar (in bold). Of those, only sequences were selected where also at least 6 residues up- and downstream of the splice site matched (in black, matching residues in bold). This minimized false-positive conserved splice sites,
although most sequences that had a similar splice site (> 5/10 similar residues) already showed homology in the rest of the
sequences. All matching sequences are between distantly related eukaryotic kingdoms, e.g. between Protists, Fungi, Animals
and Plants, ensuring that a match would have originated close to the root of the Eukaryotic Tree. For each set, its conserved
domain as retrieved from CDD (shaded box) is shown, while the columns show the species name, the sequence around the

genome evolution. However, since the query used to look
for ancient introns is based upon selecting conserved
sequences, the introns found in ancient protein modules
could also represent a sample of a larger number of randomly distributed introns and not be specific for ancient
genes. This can be investigated by studying the relation
between the ancientness of the selected sequences and the
presence of an intron where a positive correlation would
be expected according to the Exon theory. No relation
could point to a bias in the results, where the putative
ancient introns are just a sub-selection of conserved
sequences that happen to contain a conserved intron.

codon). The smallest exon size that was found in this
study comprised 4 nucleotides, a 2 amino acid-long exon
flanked by a phase 0 and a phase 1 exon (see Fig. 4;
between 2nd and 3rd intron). Members of the Rab related
genes are common throughout the eukaryotic tree, and
members of the serine/threonine kinases and the protein
phosphatase 2 domain are also present in Bacteria and
Archaea, indicating their ancient origin. These results
show that the mapping of these individual conserved
splice sites to its ancestor protein can reveal the widespread occurrence of these sites in ancient proteins.
Quantifying the relation between intron and sequence
conservation
From an introns-early perspective, the conserved introns
that were found in ancient protein domains, such as those
for phosphatase and kinase, could represent the remnants
of the introns between the exons that could have been
used for the exon concatenation or shuffling in early

In order to quantify the relation between ancientness of
the gene and the presence of an intron, an experimental
setup was used in which the effect of the splice site on the
ancientness of the sequence could be studied. A variablelength splice site region was defined in which the length
of the identical exon sequence could be stepwise increased
from 2 to 10 identical residues by adjusting the SQL query
(Fig. 5A). A measure of the ancientness of the surrounding
sequence was taken by calculation of the number of identical sequences up- and downstream of the splice site. In
order to show the specific effect of the intron, a control situation was created that had the same selection criteria,
except for the presence of an intron (Fig. 5B). It was found
that when short identical splice site sequences (1 to 2 residues on each side) were taken, the sequences did generally not show any further similarity, due the relatively
high random occurrence of these short splice site
sequences. Longer identical sequence adjacent to the
splice site (4 to 5 on each side) selected mostly conserved
genes, as measured by the number of identical residues
up- and downstream of the splice site (Fig. 5C). Also in
the absence of introns, selection for a short region of similarity yields in general non-conserved sequences, whereas
a match of a stretch of 10 identical amino acids between
distantly-related kingdoms almost always means that
there is more homology in the sequence concerned (Fig.
5D). In general, these results show a relation between the
ancientness of the genes and form the basis for an analysis
of the effect of an intron.
Positive correlation between intron presence and
ancientness of sequence
Using the described set-up above (Fig. 5), the length of the
splice site was varied and the effect on the ancientness of
the genes in each set was determined. As expected, short
stretches (2–4 identical residues) hardly yielded conserved genes, while with longer (10 residues) regions only
conserved sequences were found, both with and without
an intron. However, with sequences of intermediate
length (6–8 residues), sequences with an intron are generally more conserved than their counterpart without an
intron, as measured by the number of identical residues in

Figure 4
Conserved splice sites mapped to the conserved domain of an ancient phosphatase
Conserved splice sites mapped to the conserved domain of an ancient phosphatase. Eleven sequences with conserved splice
sites could be mapped to the consensus sequence of ancient phosphatase (CDD identifier cd00144), cf. Fig. 3. The 300 amino
acid-long conserved protein domain is shown on the top, with a residue number indicated at the bottom. This sequence can be
found by using the entry cd00144 in the CDD at NCBI. The short colored boxes represent a 30 amino acid long splice site
region, two examples of a 'cd00144-related' sequence can be found in Fig. 2. Conserved splice sites positions are indicated by
the vertical lines on the conserved domain sequence and arrowheads, while intron phase is also shown.

the region directly outside the defined splice site (Fig. 6A).
An analysis of the distribution histograms (not shown)
indicated that the increase in conservation was due to a
recruitment of conserved genes, and not a gradual
increase in general homology. Sequences that had 6 out of
20 additional residues in common (excluding the splice
site region) were considered conserved. When instead of
the number of shared residues, the sequences were
divided in non-conserved (<= 4 residues) and conserved
(>= 6) sequences, the effect of the presence of the intron
was more pronounced (Fig. 6B). These results show that
the presence of intron has an effect on the percentage of
ancient sequences obtained, which is not expected when
the method just selected ancient genes that happened to
share an intron, regardless of antiquity.
A second, independent measure of the ancientness of the
sequences that contain conserved introns can be made
based on their presence in the main Life groups Bacteria,
Archaea and Eukarya. Instead of counting the number of
common residues as done in Fig. 6, the 30-residue splice
site region was used as an input for a BLAST query at
NCBI. The phylogenetic distribution of the specific input
sequence was included in the output so that the presence
throughout the Tree of Life could be determined. A
number of identical amino acids residues of 6 (2 × 3)
around a (virtual) splice site was used as the number that
could best distinguish between ancientness of the genes
(cf. Fig. 6B). From this set, only the splice site sequences
were taken that did not show considerable sequence similarity apart from the splice site region itself. In the set that
contained an intron, 42.1% (8/19) of these splice site

sequences with low similarity except from the splice site,
were represented by a protein that was found between at
least two of the three main kingdoms. In contrast, in
sequences without an intron, only 19.6% (10/51) represented genes found between the three main kingdoms (pvalue = 0.053 using T-test). Using the presence of the gene
sequence in the conserved domain database as another
measure of ancientness, in the set with introns, 52.6%
(10/19) was a member of a conserved domain protein
family as derived from a CDD search, versus 23.5% (12/
51) in the sequences without an intron (p-value < 0.018
using T-test). In both sets, the average number of residues
up- and downstream of the splice site was similar, 0.89 ±
0.19 (mean ± sem; n = 19) with intron and 1.13 ± 0.14 (n
= 51) with intron, indicating no starting bias towards
homologous sequences. These results confirm the basic
findings shown in Fig. 6 that introns are positively correlated with the ancientness of its surrounding sequences.
Intron phase distributions between intron subsets
As expected when the introns were present before the protein sequences diverged, intron phase was found to be
conserved in the set of putative conserved splice sites (cf.
Fig. 2). However, the same pattern could have been
observed when introns were inserted into specific target
sequences (proto-splice sites). To distinguish between
these possibilities, the conservation of intron phase was
compared to sets of sequences with matching splice sites,
but with no other similarities of the sequence. Figure 7A
shows that intron position (phase) is not conserved
between introns that are only identical at the splice junction, but was conserved when such a sequence was

Experimental set-up to determine the effect of intron presence on the ancientness of the sequence it is in. A. The number of
identical splice site residues was varied between 2 (one residue on both sides of the intron position) to 10 (2*5). The maximum
number of 10 represents then a perfect match of 10 residues around a splice site. As an indication of sequence ancientness, the
number of matching residues further up- and downstream was calculated. The maximum number that can be reached is 20 (10
on each side) representing a perfect match in this region. B. Control situation that described the setup with identical parameters but without an intron. All sequence comparisons in this control were thus performed relative to a virtual splice site
(intron position). C. Example sequences that have respectively 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 fixed identical sequences at each end of their
splice site (in red). The fixed identical sequences around the splice site are shown in bold red. Identical residues further up- and

embedded in a conserved gene. These results show that it
is the ancientness of the gene that determines the phase of
a specific intron and not the splice site sequence, and
argue against parallel insertion of introns in a proto-splice
site. The distribution of intron phase itself showed no
direct relation to the ancientness of the sequence since the
subset of introns that are located in ancient sequences has
a similar phase distribution as introns in the general population (Fig. 7B). The conservation of intron phase and
distribution are in line with an early establishment of
intron phase.

with a splice site were compared with control sequences
without a splice site (cf. Fig. 5A and B). Maximum number of
identical residues is 20, representing 100% similarity in this
region. Error bars represent standard deviation with N = 650
(x = 1), N = 564 (x = 2), N = 34 (x = 3), N = 11 (x = 4) and
N = 27 (x = 5), and for the control N = 267, 695, 199, 60 and
65, respectively. B. The same data set as in A, but now the
percentage of conserved sequences as a function of number of
fixed identical residues is shown. Conserved sequences were
defined as having 6 or more identical residues (apart from
the identical residues in the splice site; red in Fig. 5) in the
two regions of homology (black in Fig. 5), dividing the data in
a non-conserved and a conserved gene set. Cf. Fig. 5C where
the first 2 sequences would be considered non-conserved,
and the last 3 would be conserved.

Methodological aspects in the study of the origins of intron
In this study, a straightforward search method in a relational database was used to identify candidate conserved
introns that could have delineated ancient exons. One of
the advantages of this method was that the definition of a
conserved intron can be easily translated in terms of the
query language SQL. Also, the method allowed to precisely define and control the variables used, permitting
quantitative analysis of the queries. A strict definition of a
conserved splice site was used where not only the position, but also the sequence was conserved and where
intron-sliding was not allowed. Other datasets of conserved introns have been published [22,23] that showed a
large number of introns that are shared between eukaryotic kingdoms. In these studies, first common eukaryotic
genes were selected using a BLAST search, after which the
number of conserved intron positions in those genes was
determined using an alignment algorithm. Although
yielding many more conserved introns than in this study,
the complexity of the used algorithms to select a set of
genes and align them, makes it difficult to interpret different intron characteristics within the given set of conserved
introns.

The stringency of the method used in the present article, a
high similarity over a short sequence, was designed to
select virtually no false-positive conserved introns. The set
of conserved introns is therefore not exhaustive, but was
intended to identify conserved introns that would satisfy
the definition for ancient introns. Since the method
involves only a short sequence for a potential match, it
does not rely on any a priori homology outside this region,
allowing to find conserved splice sites in sequences from
genes that show little overall homology, for instance in
co-orthologous genes. The strict definition of a conserved
splice site therefore limited the result set, but did select a
well-defined subset of splice sites that could represent the
ancient exon building blocks of protein modules. In summary, the present methodological concept can be seen as
complementary to more conventional methods to study
the conservation of introns.

eliminate useless DNA, or alternatively these introns have
acquired a function that would prevent these specific
introns from being pruned from the genes. The number of
splice sites in some conserved protein domains (e.g. phosphatase in Fig. 4) suggest that ancient protein domains
were composed of many exons (or contained many
introns), which has also been proposed in other studies
[22,36,38]. The current study suggest a minimum exon
length around 4 nucleotides, similar to modern minimum reported exon lengths (see [39] for exon sizes). Also,
the present study suggests that only a fraction of the
ancient intron positions remained in the modern genes,
in line with current models that assume massive intron
loss (for recent reviews see [19,26-28]. No relation
between the ancientness of the sequence and the absolute
value of the phase was found, indicating that the current
phase distribution is similar to the ancient one. This
would also be in line with an ancient origin of introns
where phase was already determined and mainly intron
loss occurred. This is in contrast with other studies that
have showed correlations with phase arguing for an
introns-early [36,40], or introns-late scenarios [41].

introns that are shared between different eukaryotic kingdoms. The rationale behind this article was based on the
assumption that exons originated at the origins of the
genome itself (see [18] and represent the building blocks
of functional modules (c.f. the Exon theory of genes). In
this view, the conserved introns found could represent the
last remnants of a slow streamlining process that tends to

In an introns-early/Exon theory scenario, one would
expect that conserved introns would be preferentially
found in sequences that have been conserved. In this article, a positive correlation was shown between intron presence and ancientness of the sequence it is in. Although
providing circumstantial evidence for an introns-early scenario, it will be difficult to discriminate between an
ancient presence and loss in prokaryotes (cf. intronsearly) versus an insertion early in the eukaryotic tree (cf.
introns-late). However, the emerging view of an ancestor
eukaryote that already contained a complex, intron-rich
genome [[42-44], this study] makes an introns-late scenario mechanistically difficult. In an introns-late scenario,
the preferred occurrence in conserved sequences would
suggest the insertion of introns very early in the eukaryotic
tree, or assume a preferential insertion in ancient genes. It
is difficult to imagine how a massive invasion of introns
into existing, and essential protein modules early in
eukaryotic evolution is feasible without major effects on
fitness. Therefore, results that focus on the more mechanistic steps of intron origin may still feed the debate about
the origin of introns.
Exons as building blocks of the genome
In the Exon theory of genes [6,45], it was proposed that
introns would specifically delineate functional boundaries, e.g. protein modules, in ancient genes where introns
would facilitate the creation of multifunction genes by
providing the actual sites of recombination. Recently, it
was reasoned based on the engineering paradigm designby-contract, that exon concatenation of modular exonic
sequences was the basis of eukaryotic genome formation

[18], providing a mechanistic basis for the Exon theory of
genes. In the current study, conserved introns positions
were found within a variety of ancient protein modules,
suggesting that the initial function of exons did not represent the boundaries of functional protein modules, but
that the domains itself were assembled from exons. In
such a model, individual exons do not have to coincide
with functional modules but could represent structural
modules or just connectors (like LEGO blocks) with no
further intrinsic function, in line with the relative small
size of some of the proposed ancient exons. Shuffling and
recombination of these building blocks could then
quickly generate a large variety of potential functional
modules, on which natural selection can then act. It is the
author's opinion that such active recombination mechanisms are a requirement for building a genome and may
underlie an intrinsic evolvability in the genome. Also,
such a scenario fits in a model in which a eukaryotic-like
genome was the ancestor genome and prokaryotes were
derived from this ancestor (see [46,47]).

Methods
Large-scale analysis of intron position and exon amino
acid sequence was performed using a bioinformatics
approach on publicly available genomic databases. The
exon/intron database ExInt [37] was used as the main
source for the genomic data, while the online conserved
domain database (CDD) database at NCBI was used to
couple gene sequence to functional domain. The ExInt
database of genes from GenBank contains exon and
intron attributes such as sequence and phase in a relational database. This database contains three tables, a
main table with protein data such as total sequence and
gene annotation, an exon table that contained the individual exons, including exon number and sequence, and an
intron table that was used to obtain the intron phase.
Both intron and exon table were linked through the main
table by a unique gene entry identifier. Splice site junctions were determined by joining the end sequence of the
first exon with the beginning of the next exon using standard SQL functions. Each splice sequence was then compared to all other splice sequences to find a match. This
basically represented an auto-join on the exon table and
exon table aliases were used to represent each of the
potential splice junctions. Matching on amino acid
sequence was performed by standard SQL string comparison functions.
The ExInt database contains a total of 120,573 gene
sequence entries with 518,168 exons and 417,178
introns. Genomic databases like GenBank contain significant numbers of redundant sequences that have to be
dealt with when performing large-scale comparisons. A
large part of the redundancy in GenBank comes from nonidentified sequences where a gene was identified by an

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/7

algorithm that detects open reading frames and introns.
The pre-selection on the presence of the word 'gene' in the
sequence annotation selected only identified genes and
greatly reduced redundancy of the result sets, effectively
reducing the size of the database from 120,573 to 27,861
entries. The available species annotation of genes was
used to link sequences to their taxonomic category. An
additional taxon table was created by selecting representative species from the ExInt database and classifying these
into the main eukaryotic kingdoms categories Protists,
Fungi, Animals and Plants. The NCBI taxonomy browser
was used for the classification of these species. The resulting taxon table contained 94 entries with at least 10
entries within each eukaryotic kingdom, covering 60% of
the GenBank entries in the ExInt database and leaving
16,741 gene entries. Since there were more than one species per defined kingdom, result sets generally included
homologous sequences when multiple species within a
single kingdom gave a match to a single gene from
another kingdom. In order to reduce redundancy, results
were therefore cleaned by removing data with identical
eukaryotic kingdom combinations (e.g. human vs. yeast
and mouse vs. yeast was reduced to one entry).
The conserved domain database (CDD) at NCBI [48]was
used to identify the conserved domains present in a protein sequence. The short sequence of 30 amino acid residues around the (virtual) splice sites that were retrieved,
were used directly to query the CDD for evolutionary conservation using the interactive query functionality of the
CDD browser at NCBI. A positive match returned the consensus sequence of the conserved domain and other genes
that belong to the same gene family. The CDD default Evalue (expectation value) threshold of 0.01 was used in all
experiments. Using the interactive information provided
by NCBI for each representative species, its distribution
throughout the Tree of Life was determined.
All experiments were performed on a normal laptop PC (2
GHz, 512 MB RAM) with Windows XP running a MySQL
relational database (version 4). Querying was done using
MySQL Control Center. The result of each query was visually inspected for redundancy and specificity and was further manually checked for consistency by using the found
sequences to search the PubMed protein sequence. In general, result sets were imported in a new single-table database for further analysis. Analyses for graphical
representations and statistics were done in Excel.

"Conserved intron positions in ancient protein modules"
by de Roos. The paper takes an ingenious approach to the
attempt to distinguish between the introns-late and
introns-early perspectives. Much previous evidence for the
introns-early theory has relied on the relationship of
intron positions to the coding frame of the flanking
exonic sequence, or to the three-dimensional structure of
the corresponding protein, findings whose existence and
relevance have not always been accepted by proponents of
introns-late. Avoiding these mine strewn landscapes, de
Roos investigates another prediction of the presence of
introns in LUCA – if introns were (primarily) created in
ancient times, they should preferentially fall within
ancient sequences. However, I am very concerned about
various methodological issues, and therefore suspect that
the results do not inform the debate.
Author's response
In concordance with the comments of other reviewers, I have
focused less on a discrimination between introns-late and
introns-early, but more towards support of the Exon theory of
genes. I also discussed the potential bias in the results and the
way this was investigated.

The author presents three related lines of evidence for preLUCA introns. First, conserved introns tend to be found in
conserved protein domains. Second, among conserved
sequences, those that contain introns are more conserved
(i.e. sequences conservation extends further along the protein sequence). Third, conserved introns are preferentially
found in genes common to all three domains of life.
An alternative explanation for the first finding, that
introns tend to be found in conserved protein domains, is
that there is a bias in the finding of 'conserved' introns.
Here, conserved introns means those introns that share
positions across eukaryotic groups in very highly conserved sequences (for instance 6 residues exactly conserved). Similarly, domains are currently generally
defined by sequence conservation across long evolutionary distances. Thus, this finding reduces to: introns in
short highly conserved sequences are preferentially found
in longer highly conserved sequences. This is not particularly surprising. Without a subtle negative control, it is

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/7

hard to discern a signal of ancientness above this potential
bias.
Author's response
I am aware that the finding of conserved introns in conserved
domains does not prove an ancient origin, since the search
method could not discriminate directly between an insertion
early in the eukaryotic tree. However, the Exon theory of genes
expects conserved introns in ancient modules and the first part
of the article set out to find those potential conserved introns. In
this way it is a confirmation of the hypothesis, although it cannot be considered evidence. I designed the experiments in Figs
5 and 6 to address this point (see below). The nature of the bias
and how this has been investigated is now stated explicitly.

The second finding is curious, but I fear may also be
explained by limitations in the methodology. Here, the
central finding is that short highly-conserved sequences
containing conserved introns are more likely to lie in long
highly-conserved sequences than are those that do not
contain introns. Given the enormity of the sequence database, it is likely that some highly-conserved sixmers will
be false positives – i.e. they will not reflect true homology.
The probability of a false positive is greatly reduced by the
presence of a conserved intron (the vast majority conserved-sequence, conserved-intron sequences are likely
homologous). Thus, the conserved intron-containing set
is likely to contain far fewer false-positives than the control set. The higher false positive rate among the control
set predicts a lower extent of sequence conservation, just
as seen. Thus it is again difficult to discern a signal of
ancientness.
Author's response
In order to investigate a potential bias, the experiments in Fig.
5 were designed, were a control situation was created that used
exactly the same methodology, but now without an intron. It
was shown that sequences without an intron are less often
found within a conserved domain or sequence. In other words,
if a sample is taken from a genomic database that selects short,
highly similar sequences, the gene it is in is more ancient if an
intron is also shared between these sequences. This would not
be expected when the sequences with an intron are just a subset
of a larger set with conserved sequences regardless of an intron.

The assumption that the probability of a false positive is greatly
reduced by the presence of a conserved intron was actually
tested in the experiments. Although not evidence for the ancient
origins, this does strengthen the finding that introns at similar
positions in conserved genes are homologous and would be in
line with an Exon theory of genes.
The final finding, that intron-containing matching
sequences are preferentially found across domains of life,
is not statistically significant: the fraction of intron-con-

Page 11 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:7

taining sequences in 'ancient' genes (8/19) is not statistically different from the fraction of intronless sequences
(10/51; P = 0.07 by a Fisher Exact Test). Thus while the difference in fractions of ancient genes is suggestive, we cannot currently conclude anything from this finding. In
addition, I am concerned that this test may also suffer
from problems similar to those discussed above.
Author's response
These sets consisted of sequences where only the splice site
sequence matched (2 × 3 residues), but did not show any further substantial gene similarity. It is true that this value is not
statistically different, and this is now shown (I found p = 0.053
using Student T test). However, there were more than one test
that suggested the ancientness: a) overall sequence similarity,
b) representatives of ancient protein modules, and c) representatives of protein modules that are shared between prokaryotes
as well as eukaryotes. Although these tests cannot be considered
truly independent, the set of controls does suggest that the
introns are preferentially located in ancient sequences.

In addition, the unorthodox methods used (complete
sequence conservation over short sequence fragments) are
hard to evaluate given the lack of a history for such methods. It is not clear why these methods have been chosen
over more traditional tools, which are abundant. This
makes it difficult to interpret the data.
Author's response
I have included a paragraph that discusses the method used,
and added the result set of potential conserved introns.

Assuming an 'Exon theory of genes'-scenario (de Roos, 2005),
I set out to look for conserved introns. I defined a potential conserved intron just by a shared intron in a short sequence, without any preselection of the type of genes. Since SQL is a
powerful tool to extract specific information from large relational data sources, this quickly led to introns that could be considered conserved. Since sequence matching was done using a
simple algorithm that compared sequence similarity, it was easy
to control the variables and do the experiments with control
sequences as in Fig. 5. I believe this is one of the main advantages: the straightforward way of querying makes it possible to
design predictive experiments by changing one parameter at a
time and use a control situation.
One further consideration is the usage of the word
'ancient.' This word is traditionally reserved in the context
of the intron debate for the period before the divergence
of eukaryotes from prokaryotes, and this distinction has
become all the more important with the mounting evidence for significant intron presence in early eukaryotes.
One way to distinguish the two epochs is between
'ancient' and 'ancient/early eukaryotic'.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/7

Author's response
This is an important distinction and has been made more clear
in the article. Although it is difficult to make a distinction
between ancient and ancient/early eukaryotic with the experiments presented, the data is in line with ancient origin (before
pro/eukaryotic split). I assume, however, that eukaryotes were
not derived from prokaryotes, but that they both share an ancestor whose genome was eukaryotic-like.

Following a long line of previous results, de Roos identifies intron positions that are shared between broad
eukaryotic groups. Previous statistical analyses of the
numbers and distributions of these patterns have concluded that a substantial majority of these represent
ancestral positions, indicating that there were already substantial intron numbers by the time of divergence. While
the eukaryotic groups used here (and elsewhere) may not
allow for inferring an intron's presence in the last ancestor
of all extant eukaryotes, we can now be confident that
there were already a very large number of introns in the
last ancestor of eukaryotes, since the spliceosome is
broadly shared among eukaryotes, and large numbers of
intron positions are shared between potentially early
diverging eukaryotes and others (Slamovits and Keeling
this year solidified the last link, showing conservation of
more than 0.5 introns per gene between an excavate species and 'later-diverging' species, confirming Archibald,
O'Kelly and Doolittle's 2002 work).
I bring up this in order to point out two things. First, the
debate over the timing of introns is now over whether
introns arose in a universal ancestor or between the
eukaryotic-archaeal ancestor and the last eukaryotic
ancestor. Although findings of conservation of introns or
splicing-associated features across eukaryotes underscores
the fact that introns are very old within eukaryotes, it does
not help us to distinguish the timing of origin of spliceosomal introns. Second, it is important to point out that
the findings of large number of introns in early eukaryotes
are not fundamentally transformative for the introns
early/late debate. Though substantial intron presence is
clearly resonant with introns-early (and perhaps nearly
necessary for the model), it does not contradict the
introns-late model. The fundamental tenet of introns-late
is that introns arose after the last common universal
ancestor, thus intron presence in early eukaryotes only
refines the timing of the origin on that model.
Author's response
I rewrote sentences that implied a contradiction of introns-late.
Instead I focused on results that are in line with an Exon theory
of genes. On the other hand, the patterns of conserved introns
in ancient protein modules, phase distributions and correlation
with ancientness of genes as seen in this article, may also make

Page 12 of 17

Biology Direct 2007, 2:7

a mechanistic model for introns-late more difficult and is therefore relevant to the debate.
I think that the most important question in unravelling the origins of introns is whether introns were inserted into preformed
genes, or were at the basis of the genes themselves. Insertion of
introns at the DNA level seems extremely difficult given the fact
that an intron should be excised at the RNA level perfectly in
order to be functional. I have not seen a mechanism for gradual
spliceosome evolution and intron insertion that could address
the negative fitness effects of such a scenario. Moreover, intron
insertion models should explain how complex genes arose in the
first place without the help of exons. So, as long as the mechanistic puzzles have not been solved, I consider the debate still
open.
In light of this, we can ask whether tests such as those
undertaken here are likely to shed light on the introns
early/late debate. The presence of shared introns in shared
eukaryotic genes does not shed light on whether these
introns date to earlier epochs. One possible approach
would be to compare intron densities between ancient
(shared eukaryotic-prokaryotic) gene and ancient eukaryotic genes. However, even in this case a difference would
not be conclusive support for ancient introns, since the
origin of many ancestral eukaryotic genes may postdate
the origin of introns. And this is leaving aside the differential rates of intron loss across genes, the fact that genes that
arise by gene duplication (and then diverge beyond recognition) may retain ancestral introns, and difficulties with
distinguishing truly eukaryotic-specific genes from the
inability of programs like BLAST to detect homology.
Author's response
Another approach may be to first unravel the mechanistic steps
in an Exon theory of genes for building a genome, and then
compare the construction of eukaryotic genes with those of
prokaryotes and see if they are assembled in a similar way. In
this respect, the proto splice-sites as proposed by Dibb and Newman[49]could as well represent the remnants of the ancient
exon concatenations (see[18]).
Reviewer's report 2
Sandro de Souza, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research,
Sao Paulo, Brazil. Nominated by Manyuan Long

Albert de Roos developed a new way to identify conserved
intron positions between taxa from different kingdoms of
life. Instead of looking for conserved intron positions in
know related genes, de Roos searches for conserved
"splice sites" in an intron database. By "splice site", he
means a segment of protein sequence (10 aa residues)
flanking an intron position. He considered an intron position conserved when this "splice site" was conserved (6
out of 10 residues in that window) between two distantly

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/7

related protein sequences. The strategy may be interesting
since it can identify cases missed by other approaches.
Although I recognize the efforts of the author in trying to
look at this problem with a different, creative strategy, I
found the manuscript hard to follow and highly speculative with many assumptions not supported by the data.
Furthermore, since this is a new strategy, the author
should give more details about the methodology as well
as provide more analyses for his dataset. I will list some
issues below in a point-by-point basis to make it easier for
the author to reply.
Author's response
I have changed the article to focus more on the data that support a 'very early' origin of introns, but does not prove intronsearly, and can by itself not disprove introns-late. The article was
too strong in that aspect.

Overall, I have many problems with the "Introduction"
section, in which many important references were misquoted or ignored.
• For instance, the original quotation for the introns-early
theory is given to Gilbert's 86 paper on RNA world and to
a review from Gilbert and colleagues in Cell (also from
86). Here the papers cited should be the Nature 1978
paper from Ford Doolittle and the "Exon Theory of
Genes" paper from Gilbert in 1987, which best represent
the early phases of the introns-early theory.
• Furthermore, the synthetic theory of intron evolution,
developed by myself, Scott Roy and Wally Gilbert is completely ignored.
• In a particular point, the papers cited as evidence for a
correlation between intron positions and module boundaries is certainly outdated. Papers from de Souza et al
(1996), de Souza et al (1998) and Fedorov et al (2001)
were ignored but best represent the conceptual aspect
explored by the author.
Author's response
I changed the references and rewrote the introduction.

1) In the last paragraph of the "Introduction" section, the
author state that the rationale for this manuscript was
based in the assumption that "....one would expect to find
conserved introns specifically in ancient proteins". In the way
is presented, this sounds wrong. An intron conserved
between vertebrates and invertebrates does not necessarily
be located in an ancient gene. I think the author should be
more explicit by saying that this conservation has to be
deep among the four kingdoms that he later will mention.

Page 13 of 17
(page number not for citation purposes)

Biology Direct 2007, 2:7

Author's response
I rewrote the introduction and the articles focuses on the identification of possible ancient introns and their characteristics.

2) It would be nice to have a more detailed description of
the 251 (or 250?) conserved intron positions. The entire
list of positions should be available. It was not clear as
well the level of stringency used in the analysis. As far as I
understood a simple match involving proteins from, for
example, human and Arabidopsis was suffice to flag that
as conserved.
Author's response
I included the entire result set of the potentially conserved
introns, as well as the larger set with strongly homologous genes
that was cleaned to obtain the 251 potential ancient introns.
The flag 'shared between major eukaryotic kingdoms' was
indeed based on the occurrence in plants as well as animals. In
order to further qualify for 'conserved', the splice site sequence
and intron position should be conserved, as well as show more
homology further away from the splice site. The stringency is
also discussed in the article.

3) Since this is a new method, the author should compare
his dataset with other datasets. For example, the dataset
reported by Rogozin et al (Curr. Biol 13:1512–1517,
2003) was analyzed by these authors and by Roy and Gilbert (PNAS 102:1986–1991, 2005). The datasets are
apparently significant different. They should be since the
methodology is different but the author needs to explore
these differences. For instance, I am surprised by the low
number of conserved intron position identified by de
Roos. In the dataset mentioned above, there were almost
a thousand introns conserved between animals and A.
thaliana or P. falciparum.
Author's response
I included a comparison of the different method used and the
results that were obtained in both mentioned articles. The
method used in my article is quite stringent in the way that it
requires high sequence similarity in a short region. The basic
concept of an ancient intron, i.e. an intron at the same position
within a similar sequence was used, so not only the position but
also the splice site sequence had to match. I expect that a more
BLAST like search with gap-alignment of homologous amino
acids would yield more conserved introns. The scope of the first
part of the article was not to get an exhaustive set, but to confirm that they exist and to study some characteristics.

4) Many of the interpretations seem to me quite speculative and not supported by the data. For example, by looking at so many introns, it is expected that some matches
will occur just by chance. Some simulations aimed to
draw a threshold for this numbers would be welcomed.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/7

Author's response
As now more explicitly mentioned in the article, there is a
potential bias in the search method, which was investigated and
shown in Fig. 5 and in Fig. 6 which was quantified. The results
supported the hypothesis of the Exon theory, and I have been
careful not to suggest that they prove introns-early. See also discussion of dr. Roy's review.

5) The analysis on the occurrence of conserved intron
positions in ancient genes is presented in a confusing way.
I strongly recommend the author to re-write this. Nevertheless, I have serious concerns about the analysis. First, it
seems that de Roos call a gene ancient when there is some
conservation in a window of 10 residues. This window
size should be increased to at least the average size of a
protein domain. Furthermore, it does not seem that the
CDD database was used here.
Author's response
I rewrote the analysis. I call an intron ancient when it is located
in a conserved sequence, i.e. there is splice site similarity (6/10)
as well a overall gene similarity as measured over an additional
20 (2 × 10) amino acids, overall a similarity of at least 12/30.
In my approach this yielded a strong selection of conserved
genes, and most matched sequences were a member of a conserved protein domain and shared a similar phase.
Author's response
There was no a priori assumption of gene relatedness and the
CDD database was indeed not used to find the conserved set,
but was used to confirm the ancientness of the set. As Fig. 6
shows, when only an 8/10 splice site similarity was used, most
sequences were conserved as shown by the sequence similarity
further up and downstream. Lowering this to 6/10 but requiring an additional 6/20 (total 12/30) selected only conserved
genes. Even with only a similar splice site (2 × 3 identical) and
no further similarity, the sequences were in 42.1% genes
shared with prokaryotes and 52.6% were member of a conserved domain (see text).

6) The interpretation derived from the analyses on the
ancientness of the genes identified is kind of circular. Of
course, if a condition was established in the early stages of
the pipeline that a match would be considered a match
only if involved kingdoms that split a long time ago, I
would expect to have my dataset enriched with ancient
proteins.
Author's response
The article consists in a way of two parts. In the first, I tried to
get a set of conserved introns by specifically looking for them.
Since I query for similar intron positions between sequences
that diverged in the eukaryotic tree, the dataset will be enriched
for ancient proteins. I then looked whether this enrichment is
due to the presence of an intron, or solely intrinsic to the

Page 14 of 17

Biology Direct 2007, 2:7

method used. As can be seen in the controls of Figs 5, 6, 7, the
presence of an intron makes a difference both in conservation
of phase and overall sequence. I conclude that the enrichment
of these sequences is due to the presence of the introns, and not
a result of the method. In the Results as well as in the Discussion section, I made this more clear.
Reviewer's report 3
Gáspár Jékely, European Molecular Biology Laboratory,
Heidelberg, Germany

This paper describes a new method to identified conserved intron positions in distantly related eukaryotic
taxa. It is based on looking at short protein sequence
stretches around a splice site and finding similar
sequences having an intron at the corresponding position,
rather then defining and aligning orthologs and then
mapping intron positions onto the alignment. Using this
method the author identifies 218 introns with the same
phase at homologous sites that probably trace back to
early eukaryote evolution. The method is novel and interesting. I have some comments on how to improve the
presentation and analysis of the results.
1) One problem is that the phylogenetic context is not
defined explicitly. It is not enough to refer to kingdoms,
especially in the case of protist. If an intron is shared by
animals, fungi (and in addition e.g. by choanoflagellate
protists), it does not mean, that it was there in the eukaryotic common ancestor. The phyletic distribution of each
identified intron shared by two or more kingdoms should
be checked against a simplified but rooted eukaryote tree
including the species under study (best would be to take a
tree rooted between Unikonts and Bikonts). Only this way
can the author reliably reconstruct conserved intron positions that have most likely been already present in the last
eukaryotic common ancestor.
Author's response
In line with the comments of the other reviewers, I have weakened the conclusions about the timing of the origin of introns
based on the results presented here. Instead, the article is placed
more as additional support for the Exon theory of genes, by the
demonstration of conserved introns in ancient genes such as
phosphatases.

2) All the identified conserved introns should be shown in
a word or excel sheet as supplemental information.
Author's response
I now made the entire set available for download, including a
set that still includes homologous genes (e.g Arac10 and
Arac13, or gpc2 and GapC represent strongly homologous
sequences.

http://www.biology-direct.com/content/2/1/7

3) "Shared introns in ancient protein domains"
When the results of the CDD searches are presented, they
should be presented along with a control, preferably as a
table or graph. Great care should be taken when designing
a control set (or sets). It should be selected based on the
same criteria, including the phyletic distribution. It is
quite tricky, given that the 'result set' is heterogeneous in
this regard. The control should be of similar sample size
as well, and given the heterogeneity and the small sample
the best would be to sample a control many times independently (e.g. to have five control sets of ~ 200
sequences that show the same degree of sequence similarity across the same phyletic distance as the 'result set'). The
selection for highly conserved sequences will obviously
result in an enrichment of conserved domains. The design
of the controls is crucial for the correct interpretation of
the results, and it should be explained in detail in the text.
Author's response
I have added paragraphs explaining the method and results in
more detail. The sample size was not correctly given and the
sample size for the control was not included, and this was
changed. The results in Figs. 3 and 4 do not have a direct control, they represent potential conserved introns and represent a
different set used in Figs 6 and 7. It was investigated whether
this was the result of a bias in the query and just represent a
subset of conserved introns in conserved genes. The quantitative
experiments in Figs. 6 and 7 show this potential bias in a controlled situation, where the only difference between the sets is
the presence of an intron. The positive correlation between presence of an intron and ancientness of the sequence is taken as
support for the hypothesis that introns were indeed ancient.

4) "Preferred occurrence of conserved introns in ancient
genes"
In the analysis to identify prokaryotic hits, only sequences
having "a number of identical amino acids residues of 6
(2 × 3) around a (virtual) splice site" were used. This
means 19 sequences. The analysis should best be repeated
for the whole set (218 sequences), with the appropriate
control set (see above).
Author's response
As can be seen in the graph of Fig. 6, there is a small window
where are difference can be seen in ancientness of the genes. A
lower similarity (2 or 4 identical residues) would mainly select
false-positives, a higher number will select only conserved
sequences in both sets. If the whole set is taken, then any effect
will disappear in the noise. This represents one of the problems
in analyzing intron data: given the enormous introns loss and
possibly gain during evolution, together with possible intron
sliding and the continuous protein diversification, it is difficult
to discern an ancient signal in this noise.

On page 2 the author writes: "The strongest prediction of
an introns-early scenario is the presence of conserved
introns between orthologous proteins that diverged early
in the eukaryotic lineage." I don't think it is correct. If
introns originated early during eukaryote evolution, but
still later then prokaryotic genes, i.e. not as building
blocks of the first genes to be assembled, one would also
expect to find many conserved introns between eukaryotic
orthologs.
Author's response
I changed the introduction. Although expected in introns-early,
conserved introns are compatible with introns-late. As now
mentioned in the article in the last paragraph of the Discussion,
I believe that the ancestral genome of prokaryotes and eukaryotes was a eukaryotic-like genome with characteristics such as
introns and the RNA relics (e.g. the ribosome and the spliceosome). In that respect, early eukaryotic and ancient would be
synonymous.

Page 2/3: "It was found that conserved introns are frequently and specifically found in ancient protein
domains" the word 'specifically' is too strong here, it
would mean that conserved introns are only found in
ancient domains, which is not the case (it is 53%).

sists of a set of conserved introns, based on the requirement that
any 6 out of 10 residues should be identical, the second set consists of 5 separate queries in which the exact position of the
identical residues was determined.
Page 7: "These results support the idea of ancient introns
and are difficult to reconcile with an origin of introns late
in evolution, although an insertion directly after the
eukaryote-prokaryote split cannot be excluded based on
the current results." I would rather say that the results
nicely support the ancestral presence of introns in the
eukaryote common ancestor. This is interesting enough,
and the whole paper and discussion would be much better if the author didn't try to argue too strongly for a
model, that is not strongly supported by the data, but
rather discuss what one can really conclude from the
results.
Author's response
I have changed the focus on the distinction between introns-late
and introns-early (which was not well-supported by the data
presented) towards a support for the Exon theory of genes. I
made more explicit that, seen in the light of introns-late, these
data would not exclude an introns-late scenario.

Author's response
Changed to 'positively correlated with sequence ancientness'.

The word 'ancient' is often used as a synonym of 'conserved' but it is of course not the same thing. E.g. page 5
"Thus, based on these results, introns seem to be preferentially located into ancient genes, in line with an intronsearly scenario" these are rather conserved, then necessarily
'ancient' genes.
Author's response
Checked for inappropriate references to ancient and conserved.

page 7: "In conclusion, the data presented here indicate a
high occurrence of introns in ancient genes, followed by a
massive loss of introns later in evolution. " High occurrence sounds too strong, a total of 218 introns were identified. Intron loss was not addressed in the paper, this
would require mapping the distribution of conserved
introns onto a phylogenetic tree.
Author's response
I changed this. My interpretation of the data, with an Exon theory point-of-view, is that the ancient domains contained many
introns since multiple were found in phosphatases for example
(Fig. 4). The relatively low number of conserved introns found
(251) indicate that either many were lost during evolution, or
the sequence diverged and were not picked up by the current
method. In the article there are two sets shown. The first con-
