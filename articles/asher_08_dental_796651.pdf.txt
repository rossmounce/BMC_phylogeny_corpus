Abstract
Background: Afrotheria comprises a newly recognized clade of mammals with strong molecular
evidence for its monophyly. In contrast, morphological data uniting its diverse constituents,
including elephants, sea cows, hyraxes, aardvarks, sengis, tenrecs and golden moles, have been
difficult to identify. Here, we suggest relatively late eruption of the permanent dentition as a shared
characteristic of afrotherian mammals. This characteristic and other features (such as vertebral
anomalies and testicondy) recall the phenotype of a human genetic pathology (cleidocranial
dysplasia), correlations with which have not been explored previously in the context of character
evolution within the recently established phylogeny of living mammalian clades.
Results: Although data on the absolute timing of eruption in sengis, golden moles and tenrecs are
still unknown, craniometric comparisons for ontogenetic series of these taxa show that
considerable skull growth takes place prior to the complete eruption of the permanent cheek
teeth. Specimens showing less than half (sengis, golden moles) or two-thirds (tenrecs, hyraxes) of
their permanent cheek teeth reach or exceed the median jaw length of conspecifics with a
complete dentition. With few exceptions, afrotherians are closer to median adult jaw length with
fewer erupted, permanent cheek teeth than comparable stages of non-afrotherians. Manatees (but
not dugongs), elephants and hyraxes with known age data show eruption of permanent teeth late
in ontogeny relative to other mammals. While the occurrence of delayed eruption, vertebral
anomalies and other potential afrotherian synapomorphies resemble some symptoms of a human
genetic pathology, these characteristics do not appear to covary significantly among mammalian
clades.
Conclusion: Morphological characteristics shared by such physically disparate animals such as
elephants and golden moles are not easy to recognize, but are now known to include late eruption
of permanent teeth, in addition to vertebral anomalies, testicondy and other features. Awareness
of their possible genetic correlates promises insight into the developmental basis of shared
morphological features of afrotherians and other vertebrates.

Background
Only within the last decade has it become apparent that
Afrotheria, consisting of elephants (Proboscidea), sea

cows (Sirenia), hyraxes (Hyracoidea), aardvarks (Tubulidentata), sengis (Macroscelididae), tenrecs (Tenrecidae)
and golden moles (Chrysochloridae), comprises a natural

assemblage of mammals descended from a single common ancestor [1]. Morphological features shared by these
animals, particularly between the insectivoran- and ungulate-grade afrotherians, have been difficult to identify.
However, several interesting similarities have recently
become apparent, including non-descent of the male
gonads [2], morphology of the placenta [3], variable vertebral count [4,5], a concave cotylar facet of the astragalus
[6], calcaneo-navicular contact and possibly other features
that are dependent on topology and assumptions of character optimization [7]. Although it was not recognized as
such at the time, Wilhelm Leche [8] observed an additional similarity in 1907:

primates and ungulate-grade mammals [15,16]. However,
afrotherians such as elephants, sea cows and hyraxes may
spend well over half of their lifespan without a completely
erupted permanent dentition [9-11].

"The Centetidae [= Tenrecidae] and Chrysochloridae contrast with nearly all other insectivorans, and from the large
majority of other extant mammals, in that eruption of the
permanent dentition occurs in a very late period of life,
that is, after the individual is fully grown and sexually
mature" (translated from [8], pp. 38–39).

In addition, we note a fascinating similarity between the
pattern of dental ontogeny in afrotherians and one of the
most characteristic symptoms of a human genetic pathology: cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) [17]. CCD is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from mutations to the
transcription factor Runx2 [18,19] which contributes to
regulation of the development of bone and teeth [20].
Humans with CCD may exhibit not only delayed eruption
of permanent teeth, but also supernumerary teeth,
hemivertebrae, non-descended testes [21], incompletely
ossified clavicles and cranial dermal bones, among other
anomalies [22,23]. While the extent and form of these
pathologies vary considerably across individuals, Mundlos [23] noted that delayed eruption of permanent teeth
"is a relatively constant finding. Dental disability begins
in late youth with the progressive morbidity and loss of
the deciduous dentition. Many patients remember living
'without teeth' for some years until the permanent teeth
eventually erupted" (from [23], p. 178). Other pathologies resulting in delayed dental eruption relate to nutritional defects, thyroid insufficiency, irradiation or trauma
[24]. However, to the best of our knowledge, other genetic
conditions do not consistently result in this phenotype.

Leche could not have known about the genetic evidence
in favor of Afrotheria. He interpreted this feature in tenrecs and golden moles as primitive for therian mammals,
and used it as a basis to develop his theory that the deciduous dentition is morphologically more indicative of evolutionary relationships than the permanent dentition.
While his observations regarding deciduous teeth seem
not to have had great resonance since 1907 (or to have
been thoroughly tested), delayed dental eruption in African insectivorans may be very significant. Eruption of permanent teeth well past sexual maturity is not common
among mammals, except in elephants [9], sea cows [10]
and hyraxes [11]. The remaining afrotherian clade,
Tubulidentata, does not erupt a functional, deciduous
dentition. Aardvarks are ontogenetically not well documented, with the last moderately comprehensive study of
their dental development having taken place in 1934 (see
[12]). We briefly discuss this taxon below, but defer a
fuller treatment to a separate analysis (Lehmann, Notes
on the ontogeny of the aardvark (Orycteropus afer), submitted).
Considerable variation occurs across mammals in the
number and extent of replacement among incisors,
canines, premolars and in the number of permanent
molars [13]. Less variable is the number of teeth throughout any single mammalian lifetime and the age by which
the permanent dentition is fully erupted. Nearly all mammals have only one or two generations, both limited in
number of teeth. Only Trichechus (Sirenia) and Petrogale
concinna (Diprotodontia) continually erupt supernumerary molars throughout their lifetime [10,14]. Complete
eruption of the permanent dentition in most mammals
occurs by sexual maturity [15]. Slight delays are known in

In this paper, we suggest that this pattern also characterizes small afrotherians (i.e., sengis, tenrecs and golden
moles) and that delayed dental eruption comprises a
shared feature of Afrotheria. As data on dental ontogeny
are still lacking for small afrotherians, we evaluate metrics
of size and tooth ontogeny designed to test Leche's stillunquantified observation that these taxa exhibit late eruption of the permanent dentition.

CCD-like characters are known to occur across a number
of mammalian clades, not only afrotherians. In addition
to investigating the extent of delayed eruption in afrotherians, we also present a preliminary test of the hypothesis
that delayed eruption, vertebral anomalies, reduced clavicles, incomplete suture of cranial bones and testicondy
covary across mammals, as would be expected if they were
the result of a conserved genetic and/or developmental
program.

Results
Dental eruption relative to skull size
Absolute age data for dental eruption in tenrecs, golden
moles and sengis are not yet available in the literature. As
an alternative, we compared the proportion of erupted
permanent cheek teeth with metrics of skull size. We
expect that if these taxa show delayed eruption of the per-

manent dentition, then some or all of their permanent
teeth should finish erupting after the completion of
growth, leading to specimens at or near adult size without
a full complement of permanent teeth. Anecdotal observations of this nature (Figure 1) are in part what led Leche
[8] to draw the conclusion that tenrecs and golden moles
show delayed eruption.
This previously unquantified observation is consistent
with the data collected here. In general, afrotherians without a full complement of permanent teeth are significantly larger (as a proportion of median adult jaw length)
than non-afrotherians (such as didelphids, strepsirhines,
hominoids, platyrrhines, scandentians, canids and erinaceids) at a comparable stage (Figure 2). Among the 22
genera sampled in this study (11 afrotherians, 4 strepsirhines, 2 gibbons, 1 tree shrew, 1 carnivoran, 2 erinaceids and 1 didelphid), all of the afrotherian genera
exhibited specimens with 95% median adult jaw length
that had less than 60% of their permanent, occluding
premolars and molars erupted (Table 1). Stated differently, adult size among afrotherians is frequently reached
prior to the eruption of many permanent teeth. Nonafrotherians showing less than 60% erupted cheek teeth
were typically well under 90% median adult jaw length,

Figure 1

Jaws of Tenrec ecaudatus in lateral view. These images
demonstrate how adult size in an afrotherian may be reached
in the absence of many permanent cheek tooth loci. The old
individual above has its complete permanent dentition
erupted, showing p4-m2 worn down to their roots (UMZC
H5431J, image reversed). The individual below is larger, but
retains its deciduous canine through dp4; their permanent
successors plus m3 are still unerupted within the dentary
(BMNH 70.3.10.4). Scale bar (in millimeters) applies to both
specimens. The dotted line from the condyle to symphysis on
the top specimen represents measure taken of maximum jaw
length, quantified in Figure 2.

except for one specimen of Eulemur fulvus (ZMB 4915)
which reached 95% (Table 1). Two afrotherian groups
(macroscelidids and chrysochlorids) had specimens that
reached, or exceeded, median adult jaw length with less
than 40% of their permanent cheek teeth erupted (Figure
2). Another index of skull size, condylobasal length, also
shows that most afrotherians reach adult-proportions
with fewer permanent cheek teeth erupted. However,
because jaws are better represented in museum collections
(particularly for the growth series of the taxa we sampled),
we focus on the latter measurement in this paper.
While some specimens of Tenrec ecaudatus follow this pattern, exceeding 95% median adult jaw length despite having incompletely erupted cheek teeth (Figure 1), this
taxon shows a wide range of sizes throughout each eruption stage (Figure 2). Overall, T. ecaudatus does not reach
a significantly larger proportion of median adult jaw
length (and at one-third eruption of permanent cheek
teeth is significantly smaller) than comparable stages of
non-afrotherians. This results in part from the considerable variability in size within adult T. ecaudatus. With a
coefficient of variation (CV) for jaw length over 17 across
all adults (Table 2), Tenrec is nearly double that of the
next-closest afrotherian (Setifer, CV = 9.8). Even controlling for sex, CV for adult jaw length in Tenrec still exceeds
all others recorded in this study (male CV = 12.77; see
Table 2). Its tendency for indeterminate growth with
increasing age has been noted [25] and may actually comprise another possible similarity with otherwise morphologically disparate afrotherians, such as elephants [26].
While such large size in Tenrec is particularly noteworthy
in zoo specimens, wild-caught individuals may also reach
considerable size. For example, BMNH 97.9.1.56 (a male
collected by Forsyth-Major from Vinanitelo, Madagascar)
has a jaw measuring 83.3 mm from condyle to symphysis,
a value about 20% longer than the median adult jaw
length (including other adult males), and up to 33%
longer than other specimens that show heavily worn teeth
(e.g., ZMB 71582, jaw length 55.7 mm). Hence, the small
ratios of juvenile to adult jaw length of some Tenrec specimens result in part from the influence of unusually large
individuals on median adult jaw length, increasing the
size of the denominator and decreasing the value of Tenrec
ratios. A similar effect is evident in Didelphis, which also
shows intra-specific dimorphism and has a large CV of
adult jaw length (11.02, the only other taxon in this study
to exceed 10). Importantly, however, no specimen of
Didelphis comes within 90% of median adult jaw length
without at least two-thirds of its cheek teeth erupted. In
contrast, some Tenrec specimens approximate adult jaw
length with under half of their permanent cheek teeth
(Figure 1).

Despite these qualifications for T. ecaudatus, the afrotherians measured here with incompletely erupted permanent teeth, particularly sengis and golden moles, show

Non-afrotherians with unerupted cheek teeth are generally smaller than conspecifics with full, permanent dentitions. We interpret this to indicate that unlike

afrotherians, most other mammals erupt the permanent
dentition early enough in ontogeny so as to overlap extensively with growth.
Absolute age at eruption of permanent cheek teeth
For hyraxes, elephants, sea cows and many other mammals, absolute age at eruption of the complete, permanent
dentition is already known. Figure 3 summarizes these
data, standardized by age at female sexual maturity across
mammals. Both sexual maturity and alternative scaling
factors such as longevity may be skewed by outliers, such
as unusually long-lived zoo specimens. Because data on
sexual maturity are more widely available for wild populations than data on longevity, the former are used here.

Shigehara [15] noted that the eruption of the full permanent dentition may postdate sexual maturity in some
mammals, including most old world primates, Didelphis,
Bos, Sus, Equus, Felis and Canis familiaris (but not C. lupus
or C. mesomelas). Among the taxa he studied, only perissodactyls showed completion of dental eruption after both
sexual maturity and fusion of longbone epiphyses. However, some terrestrial artiodactyls show considerably later
eruption of permanent cheek teeth than perissodactyls. In
particular, Hippopotamus does not fully erupt all of its per-

manent cheek teeth until approximately 16 years of age
[27]. The white rhinoceros shows the latest appearance of
the complete permanent dentition among the perissodactyls sampled here, erupting all cheek teeth at around 8
years [28]. Some marsupials tend to show complete eruption of cheek teeth shortly after sexual maturity, a pattern
greatly exaggerated in the dentally manatee-like wallaby
Petrogale concinna, in which the seemingly endless eruption of supernumerary molars continues throughout life
[14]. Hence, some artiodactyls, perissodactyls, carnivorans, anthropoid primates and marsupials show complete
eruption of permanent cheek teeth at or near adulthood,
ranging from slightly after to twice the age of female sexual maturity. Other non-afrotherian mammals show complete eruption prior to female sexual maturity (Figure 3).
The three afrotherians for which dental ontogeny is best
known, Loxodonta, Procavia and Trichechus, show ages at
complete cheek-tooth eruption that are, respectively, 2.6,
3.7 and more than 10 times the age of female sexual maturity. As mentioned above, Trichechus erupts an apparently
unlimited number of cheek teeth throughout life [10]. In
contrast, the highly-derived, peg-like cheek teeth of the
sirenian Dugong dugon erupt between 6 and 9 years, at or
shortly before sexual maturity at around 9 years; the
prominent tusks of the dugong erupt later at around 15
years [29]. Compared with other major clades of mammals, and except for the cheek teeth of the dugong (but
not its incisors), paenungulate afrotherians show late
eruption of permanent teeth, postdating sexual maturity
by a wide margin (Figure 3).
CCD-like characters across mammals
In addition to humans, Runx2 sequence variation has also
been documented in mice [30-32] and domestic dogs
[33]. Homozygous mouse mutants lacking Runx2 fail to
ossify membrane or endochondral bones [34]. These
mutants exhibit initiation of tooth morphogenesis, but
further development is incomplete [35]. Owing to an
overall lack of bone development, they asphyxiate at birth
from an unossified ribcage. Heterozygous mutant mice
survive birth and show many of the same skeletodental
anomalies as humans with CCD, including poor ossification of membrane bones such as the clavicle and elements
of the braincase [34]. However, they develop relatively
normal molars [32] possibly because mice have just a single dental generation, not two as in most other mammals;
and in human CCD it is only the second generation of
teeth that is affected [18,23]. Molars in mice and other
mammals are commonly regarded among paleontologists
as part of the same generation as permanent premolars,
since both form the permanent dentition and partly overlap in terms of eruption. However, molars share a developmental origin from the primary dental lamina with
'first-generation' deciduous teeth, distal to the site of ori-

Distribution of CCD-like characters on mammalian phylogeny
Distribution of CCD-like characters on mammalian phylogeny. Potential CCD-like features of Afrotheria optimized
on a mammalian phylogeny [44]. Data on age at eruption are not yet known for small afrotherians (tenrecs, golden moles, sengis) or aardvarks. Based on the metric data presented in Figure 2 and in the text, we predict that when such data are available,
age at complete cheek tooth eruption in small afrotherians will greatly postdate age at female sexual maturity (corresponding
to long, horizontal red lines in elephants, hyraxes and manatees). Ages at completion of dental eruption in Trichechus and Petrogale concinna are arbitrarily set at the end of their recorded lifespan, reflecting the fact that these animals continually erupt
supernumerary teeth. Dotted vertical lines represent 1.0 ratio of age at complete dental eruption/age at female sexual maturity
(red, scale at bottom) and possession of 19 thoracolumbar vertebrae (blue, scale at top). Boxes at the center represent characters relating to phenotype observed in at least some afrotheres and human CCD patients, as follows: AN, unfused and projecting anterior nasal (black); MS, unfused metopic suture (black); PF, palatal fenestrae (black); CL, absent clavicles (black); TC,
non-descended testicles (black), abdominal and ascrotal testicles (gray), scrotal testicles (white); VN, vertebral number (20 or
more, black; 19 or less, white); DE, delayed eruption (after twice age at female sexual maturity, black; at or near female maturity, white). Scandentia, Dermoptera and Pholidota are not included owing to lack of data on dental ontogeny. Ages at female
sexual maturity are taken from [45] except where indicated in Additional file 1. Vertebral data for sea cows represent averages
from [49]. Petrogale is coded based on P. concinna for age at complete dental eruption and P. penicillata for thoracolumbar vertebral number owing to the lack of intact skeletons of the former in available collections.

gin of the latter and buccal to the embryonic 'lingual successional lamina' (see [36], p. 186) which gives rise to
permanent antemolars. Wang et al [31] observed that successionary cheek tooth buds, normally absent or very
small in wild-type mice, were much more commonly
observed in Runx2 mutant mice, further indicating that
this locus may contribute to the morphogenetic pathway
of the post-primary generation of teeth. They also noted
greater expression of Runx2 protein in the lower than in
the upper dentition. Our observations do not indicate different timing of eruption of the upper and lower teeth.
Indeed, such a pattern would be problematic for mammals with functional occlusion. However, eruption of
some lower tooth loci (e.g., p4) prior to their upper counterparts is not uncommon among mammals [37].
Sequences of afrotherian Runx2 available on public databases are limited, and at the time of writing include only
partial sequences derived from ongoing genomes of Loxodonta and Echinops [38]. Only the former samples the
DNA binding region, mutations to which may be linked
to expression of CCD in humans [19]. Sequences of Runx2
from Loxodonta and other mammals such as Pan, Macaca,
Rattus, Mus, Equus and Canis are easily alignable to human
Runx2 for at least part of their length. These non-human
mammals generally showed the conserved nucleotides
present in the human wild type, not the mutations to
Runx2 concentrated in the DNA binding domain among
human CCD patients (see Tables 1 and 2 in [19]), except
for a sequence of Canis. This specimen (GenBank
XM_532158) [39] exhibits many changes to its Runx2
sequence, including a mutation commonly present
among genetically documented human patients with
CCD [19]: instead of the 'CGG' codon for arginine (R) at
codon 225, they exhibit a 'CAG' codon for glutamine (Q).
While hypodontia among domestic dogs (and other
mammals) is known, they do not regularly show delayed
eruption of the adult dentition (Figure 2).
At first glance the distribution of CCD-like characteristics
across mammals, including delayed dental eruption, vertebral anomalies, clavicle reduction and testicondy (Figure 3), appears to show some co-occurrence. In particular,
members of Afrotheria, Perissodactyla and terrestrial
Cetartiodactyla lack clavicles and show some delay in the
eruption of permanent teeth; and afrotheres and perissodactyls exhibit an increased number of thoracolumbar
vertebrae. Examined quantitatively, however, and including other characters observed among CCD patients, this
covariation is not significant (Figure 4). The distribution
of these characters on a plot of the three principal coordinates that explain just over half of the variation does not
place them in close proximity (Figure 4A), as would be
expected if these features consistently occurred together
(see Figure 1S in [40]). Nor is there a significant correla-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/14

tion between vertebral number and delay in eruption (Figure 4B). Whether or not this signal changes with
consideration of a more complete morphological dataset,
including ontogenetic data for small afrotheres as well as
their other recently identified synapomorphies [3,6,7],
remains to be seen.

Discussion and conclusion
Ontogeny of dental eruption
Based on these observations, we conclude that Leche was
correct in his assessment that like large afrotherians in
which dental ontogeny is well documented, sengis, tenrecs and golden moles also show relatively late eruption
of the permanent dentition. Compared to non-afrotherians, permanent cheek teeth finish erupting only after
these taxa have reached adult body size. Considered in
isolation, this could mean that growth occurs faster and
earlier in these afrotherians than other mammals, rather
than the converse of late-erupting permanent teeth. However, although some afrotherians have relatively and/or
absolutely long gestation times (e.g., hyraxes and elephants), which could be interpreted to support the
hypothesis that growth takes place early, this is not true of
Afrotheria as a whole. Tenrec, for example, has a shorter
gestation time than Cavia (Rodentia) and Saimiri (Primates), although it can reach a larger body size than either
taxon (Additional file 1). The sengi Rhynchocyon (with a
mass of about 540 g and gestation of around 42 days)
compares well with the rodent Sciurus (with a mass of
about 530 g and gestation of around 44 days; see Additional file 1).

Notably, and in contrast to other afrotherians, the shrewlike tenrecid Microgale appears to erupt its molars (but not
its premolars) relatively early during its development. Few
museum collections have specimens of Microgale that
exhibit fewer than three fully erupted molars [41]. In fact,
the difficulty in distinguishing deciduous from permanent premolars in 'adult'-sized specimens of this taxon [8]
has contributed to an unusually high level of species-level
synonymy within this genus throughout much of the 20th
century [41,42]. We assume that the frequent confusion of
deciduous and permanent premolars in the literature
results from the frequent retention of the former and late
eruption of the latter, as in other small afrotherians examined here. In order to test this assumption, and include
this taxon in our sample, we would need more sophisticated techniques to determine the deciduous versus permanent identity of premolars e.g., by using radiographs or
computed tomography images, a sampling strategy that
will be employed in a future study.
A further caveat is the dentition of the highly derived aardvark. Growth in this taxon is poorly known, and the last
comprehensive summary of its dental development was

Analyses of character correlation
Analyses of character correlation. (A) Principal coordinate analysis based on morphological characters from [48], plus
those identified in Figure 3. Coordinates 1, 2 and 3 explain 35.5%, 9.4% and 6.5% of variation, respectively (other axes do not
exceed 5.2%). CCD-relevant characters are shown with polygons using abbreviations from Figure 3. (B) Correlation of number
of thoracolumbar vertebrae with ratio of age at female sexual maturity to age at complete dental eruption. Line represents
least squares fit and does not comprise a significant correlation, remaining insignificant with outliers (Petrogale, Trichechus, Procavia) removed. As in Figure 3, dental eruption for the macropodid Petrogale is based on P. concinna; vertebral number is based
on P. penicillata.

published in 1934 (see [12]). From this we know that
Orycteropus appears to lack functional deciduous teeth,
although some may persist as rudiments in the gums well
into adulthood. A summary in preparation (Lehmann,
submitted) enables us to tentatively conclude that its permanent cheek teeth are erupted at a relatively early age, a
result that is not surprising given its lack of functional
deciduous teeth. Hence, as with the molar teeth of Micro-

gale and Dugong, this too qualifies as an exception to what
we believe otherwise to be a rule among afrotherians: that
their permanent dentition finishes erupting relatively late
during ontogeny, after sexual maturity and the occurrence
of most growth.

CCD character covariation
The apparent lack of character covariation (Figure 4)
results in part from the fact that wild-type mammals represent ecologically viable populations, capable of successfully perpetuating their lineage, and should not be
expected to mirror pathologies in a different species
(Homo sapiens) with which they may share a developmental program. Regarding the genetic control of tooth succession, there is a complex interplay among genes expressing
a number of morphogenic proteins, including Shh, BMP
and FGF, which are mediated at least in part by Runx2
[18,30] and that relate to the development of teeth [3032,35,43] and bone [20,23,34]. The pathologies of CCDafflicted humans are a result of the decreased functionality
of the DNA binding region in the regulatory locus Runx2
[19,20]. Depending on the extent of this decreased functionality, CCD humans show a mix of phenotypes, often
(but not always) including features exhibited in afrotherians. Imperfect covariation among these characters
among human CCD patients does not negate their relatively well-established link to Runx2 [19]. Similarly,
imperfect correlation of CCD-like characters among
mammals does not in itself negate the potential influence
of Runx2 in their development.

Hence, a better understanding of Runx2 variation among
afrotherians may yet provide insight into the mechanisms
behind delayed eruption of the permanent teeth. We propose that this feature comprises an additional, shared
characteristic of the newly recognized afrotherian clade.

Methods
Crania housed in the Natural History Museum London
(BMNH), Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle Paris
(MNHN), Riksmuseet Stockholm (RS), University
Museum of Zoology Cambridge (UMZC) and the
Museum für Naturkunde Berlin (ZMB) were measured
and examined for state of dental eruption (Additional file
2). Representatives of the four major placental clades as
defined in [44], plus Didelphis, were chosen based on
availability of good samples of juvenile specimens in the
process of erupting cheek teeth. In order to minimize the
confounding effects of intraspecific size variation (as with
sexually dimorphic taxa), we focused on non-dimorphic
species, with the exceptions of Tenrec and Didelphis owing
to the obvious relevance of the former as an afrotherian,
and owing to the accessibility of growth series for both
taxa. Furthermore, we selected taxa that possess easily distinguishable deciduous and permanent cheek. Among
afrotherians, this included tenrecs (Oryzorictes tetradactylus, Potamogale velox, Setifer setosus and Tenrec ecaudatus),
chrysochlorids (Amblysomus hottentotus, Chrysochloris asiatica, Chrysospalax trevelyani and Eremitalpa granti), macroscelidids (Rhynchocyon [pooling R. cirnei and R. petersi] and
Petrodromus ['Elephantulus'] rozeti) and the hyrax Procavia

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/14

capensis. Among archontoglires, we sampled Lemur catta,
Eulemur fulvus, Perodicticus potto, Otolemur crassicaudatus,
Saimiri sciureus, Hylobates (a pooled sample of H. lar, H.
muelleri and H. agilis), Symphalangus syndactylus and Tupaia
javanica. Among laurasiatheres, we sampled Otocyon megalotis (notable for its consistent expression of four
molars), Erinaceus europaeus and Echinosorex gymnura.
Didelphis marsupialis comprised the marsupial sample. The
samples that pooled multiple species within a genus
(Rhynchocyon and Hylobates) contain adults of a similar
body size.
Degree of eruption was quantified in each specimen by
expressing the number of permanent, occluding cheek
teeth as a percentage of the norm for each species (Additional file 2). Specimens that have all normally occurring,
permanent cheek teeth fully erupted are defined as 'adult'.
For example, Rhynchocyon has three permanent premolars
and two molars in the maxilla and dentary, yielding a
total of 10 permanent upper and lower cheek teeth in each
half of its dentition. Its deciduous premolars are also
molariform, but are easily recognizable owing to morphology and wear relative to erupting, non-replaced
molars. A specimen with only the first upper and lower
molars erupted, and no permanent premolars, would
have 2 out of 10, or 20%, of its permanent cheek teeth. For
isolated specimens without associations, we assessed this
percentage based on the material available (e.g., 1 out of
5 permanent cheek teeth of the dentary yields 20%). Only
molariform premolars with an occlusive relationship
between uppers and lowers were counted owing to the relative ease with which their deciduous and permanent generations can be distinguished. Recognizing tooth
generation in some anterior cheek tooth loci in tenrecs
and golden moles is particularly difficult [8,41]. For these
taxa we defined a completely erupted, 'adult' dentition
using the posterior premolars and molars identified in
Additional file 2.
Data on age at complete permanent dentition, age at
female sexual maturity, body mass and gestation were collected from [45] and the literature, as identified in Additional file 1.
PAST [46] and Statistica [47] were used for the principal
coordinate analysis. Characters for thoracolumbar vertebrae (state 0 = 19 or less; state 1 = 20 or more) and eruption of the permanent dentition (state 0 = at/near sexual
maturity; state 1 over twice the age of female sexual maturity) were added to a previously compiled morphological
dataset [48], sampled here only for extant taxa. Missing
data, inapplicables and polymorphisms in that matrix
were replaced by entries representing the closest node
with an unambiguously resolved character state, informed
also by the fossil record. PAST was used to transform the

matrix into pairwise distances between characters. These
distances were then plotted with Statistica on axes representing the first three principal coordinates that explain
over 50% of the variation (Figure 4A).
