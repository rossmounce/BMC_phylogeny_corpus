or signature of southern glacial refugia?

Abstract
Background: A number of studies have described the extension of ice cover in western Patagonia during the Last
Glacial Maximum, providing evidence of a complete cover of terrestrial habitat from 41°S to 56°S and two main
refugia, one in south-eastern Tierra del Fuego and the other north of the Chiloé Island. However, recent evidence
of high genetic diversity in Patagonian river species suggests the existence of aquatic refugia in this region. Here,
we further test this hypothesis based on phylogeographic inferences from a semi-aquatic species that is a top
predator of river and marine fauna, the huillín or Southern river otter (Lontra provocax).
Results: We examined mtDNA sequences of the control region, ND5 and Cytochrome-b (2151 bp in total) in 75
samples of L. provocax from 21 locations in river and marine habitats. Phylogenetic analysis illustrates two main
divergent clades for L. provocax in continental freshwater habitat. A highly diverse clade was represented by
haplotypes from the marine habitat of the Southern Fjords and Channels (SFC) region (43°38’ to 53°08’S), whereas
only one of these haplotypes was paraphyletic and associated with northern river haplotypes.
Conclusions: Our data support the hypothesis of the persistence of L. provocax in western Patagonia, south of the
ice sheet limit, during last glacial maximum (41°S latitude). This limit also corresponds to a strong environmental
change, which might have spurred L. provocax differentiation between the two environments.

Background
Climate change caused substantial alterations of the
landscape and sea level, influencing patterns of species
distribution. Pleistocene glaciations, ice-sheet advances
and retreats in western Patagonia shaped land fragmentation, and the formation of islands and fjords along the
Pacific Coast [1]. Throughout the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM,~25 000-15 000 years ago), ice sheets
extended from 56°S up to 35°S along the Andes mountain range, and to 41°S in lowland areas and at sea-level
in South America [2,3]. The southern fjords and channels (SFC) of southern Chile (41°S to 56°S, Figure 1)
were covered by an extensive ice sheet. The pollen
record indicates major shifts in most species of plants in
this region [4]. As a result of the expected pattern of

species range contractions and subsequent expansion
after postglacial ice sheet retreat, genetic signatures of
low diversity and demographic expansions are expected
in these newly colonized areas [5,6]. This is the case for
a vast majority of sigmodontine rodents, either from
lowlands, Patagonian mountains or Tierra de Fuego
[7-9]. Other studies, however, have suggested the persistence of freshwater species in the region throughout the
last glacial period [10-13]. In the case of the Patagonian
freshwater fish Galaxias platei, distributed along the
western side of the Andes (39°S - 49°S), survival could
have occurred in a southern refuge, possibly due to discontinuities of the ice field [12]. Likewise, southern refugia of the freshwater crab Aegla alacalufi has been
suggested at the El Amarillo hot springs, which was possibly left uncovered by glacial ice, but isolated from
more northern refugia [13]. Thus, it seems populations
of freshwater species were not completely extirpated by
ice cover in southern areas. This alternative pattern

addresses important questions about the history of this
region, the magnitude of the ice cover extension, and
the consequences for the phylogeographic pattern of
species associated with the SFC system for which there
is a complete absence of data.
In Chile, the northern glacial limit is also a boundary
for major environmental changes (e.g. topography,

currents, water salinity), resulting in a major biogeographic transition for marine [14] and freshwater species
[15]. This biogeographic boundary is marked by the
oceanic divergence between the Humboldt and the Cape
Horn current systems, contributing to the relative isolation of the SFC marine fauna [16,17]. The SFC ecosystem is supplied by marine currents such as those

Vianna et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:53
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/53

from subantarctic waters. These become mixed with
freshwater from abundant precipitation, river flow, and
glacial meltwater [18]. Across the biogeographic boundary, hydrographic conditions change in freshwater environments, based on the weather, slope and lithology [19].
Two provinces are described for the biogeography of the
freshwater fishes: the Chilean province, with a southern
area of endemism from Valdivia River to Chiloé Island,
and the Patagonian province, which is restricted to the
western watersheds of continental Chiloé south to
Tierra del Fuego [15]. Different scenarios altered the
species assemblages across biogeographical limits and
likely generated distinct patterns of genetic diversity.
Phylogeographic inferences should help to understand
species evolutionary history across marine and freshwater biogeographic breaks. Here we use molecular
markers to address the hypothesis of glacial refugia on
an aquatic top predator, the Huillín or Southern river
otter, Lontra provocax. L. provocax populations extend
across the biogeographic boundary, from exclusively
freshwater habitat north of this limit to mostly marine
habitat in the SFC (Figure 1, 2).
L. provocax has the smallest geographical range of all
otter species [20], being distributed across the AndeanPatagonian region of southern Chile and part of Argentina [21-23]. In continental waters, the species is found
from the Toltén River basin (39°S latitude) to the south
of Chile [21]. The range extends through a limited area
of the Andes mountains into Nahuel Huapi National
Park and Limay River in Argentina [24-26]. South of
Chiloé Island in Chile (42°S) the species also occurs in
marine habitats along the SFC south to 56°S [27]. In the
SFC south of Taitao Peninsula (46°S latitude), however,
its distribution becomes exclusively marine [28,27]. As
L. provocax is highly dependent on the availability of
crustacean prey [29,30], the absence of the species from
continental waters is related to the absence of crustaceans in the oligotrophic waters. L. provocax is solitary
with intrasexual territoriality and an average home
range of 11.3 km in rivers [31]. Dispersal is limited, as
shown by radio-tracked otters, where the only longrange movement was made by a juvenile male that
migrated 46 km downstream after release [31]. In freshwater, occurrence of L. provocax is dependent on crustacean distribution, which is strongly influenced by the
river slope and altitude [32]. Consequently, the distribution of L. provocax along rivers is mostly concentrated
below 300 m altitude [33], which may limit gene flow
across the Andes mountain range. As crustacean and
freshwater fishes were able to live in southern Chile
during the LGM, L. provocax could have had a sufficient
amount of food to survive during this period. However,
the occurrence of L. provocax is also dependent on
riparian vegetation. Terrestrial plants such as Fitzroya

Page 3 of 12

cupressoides and Hypochaeris palustris were mostly
absent along ice sheet cover areas during LGM [34,35].
Thus, the question of L. provocax persistence during
LGM on southern Chile likely implies a trade off
between availability of food and terrestrial habitat.
So far the species has been studied mainly in the rivers and lakes at the northern limit of its distribution.
Comparisons between specimens living in freshwater
and marine environment are restricted to diet, and consists mainly of crustaceans such as Samastacus sp. and
Aegla sp. in rivers and lakes [24,29], shifting to marine
fishes of the genus Patagonotothen sp., crustaceans [36]
and sea urchins in the marine environment. Although
otter species occur mostly in freshwater habitats, the
majority of these species have also been recorded in
coastal environments [30]. Otters distributed along the
coast, however, also need access to fresh water for
drinking and washing their dense fur to remove accumulating salt and maintain thermo-insulation [30].
Fresh water is abundant along the SFC and L. provocax
has also been recorded in inland rivers, such as Queulat
River. It is important to note that, among all otter species, only two are exclusively adapted to marine habitats,
i.e. the north Pacific Ocean sea otter (Enhydra lutris)
and the chungungo or south Pacific marine otter
(Lontra felina). Lontra felina recently diverged from
L. provocax, possibly from populations in the SFC that
progressively adapted to the coastal marine habitat [37].
The present study analysed the phylogeographic pattern
and the population structure of L. provocax, based on the
mitochondrial DNA sequences from control region (CR),
the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) and the cytochrome b gene (Cyt-b). We aimed to infer: i) the demographic processes associated with the LGM south of the
Pleistocene ice cover limit for L. provocax populations;
ii) the evolutionary relationship between freshwater and
marine populations; iii) the population structure within
each habitat type, among different continental river
basins and across the Andes mountain range, comparing
L. provocax populations from Chile and Argentina.

Results
A total of 569 bp from the mitochondrial DNA control
region (CR), 575 bp for ND5 and 1,007 bp of the cytochrome b (Cyt-b) were sequenced from a total of 75
samples. A total of 11 CR haplotypes, 6 ND5 haplotypes
and 9 Cyt-b haplotypes were found for Lontra provocax
(Table 1). Although one CR haplotype did not illustrate
a clear geographic separation, ND5 and Cyt-b haplotypes showed a clear partition according to different
environments. Three ND5 haplotypes (I, II, III) were
exclusively from continental freshwater (CRL), whereas
haplotype IV was distributed from the Chiloé Island rivers (CI) to the southern fjords and channels (SFC) and

were exclusively found in SFC (Table 1). On the other
hand, the Cyt-b haplotypes (A, B and I) found in both
continental and Chiloé Island freshwater habitats (CRL
and CI), were not shared with SFC marine habitat,
which showed a high diversity of Cyt-b haplotypes (C,

(P = 0.1767) indicated statistical congruence between
the three mtDNA sequences (CR+ND5+Cyt-b), therefore concatenated sequences were used for data analysis.
Seventeen haplotypes and 26 polymorphic sites were
observed from the concatenated mtDNA sequences.

Sampling sites are divided by habitat type (CRL-continental rivers and lakes, CI- Chiloé Island or SFC-Southern Fjords and Channels) and locality numbers (Figure
1, 2), including geographic coordinates, sample size (in parenthesis included the number of samples obtained from tissue), and concatenated haplotypes found
for each location.

The concatenated haplotype A-I-A (for CR-ND5-Cytb respectively) was widely distributed in the continental
freshwater habitat, except in Petrohue where haplotype
C-III-A was observed. Haplotypes A-I-B and B-II-A
were also found only at Mahuidanchi River and Queule
River respectively. A unique haplotype A-IV-I was found
on Nahuel Huapi area in Argentina, not detected on
Chilean rivers. All samples from rivers on Chiloé Island
had a unique haplotype A-IV-A, which was not found in
continental or marine sites. In the SFC, each haplotype
was restricted to one or few locations.
The SAMOVA revealed increasing FCT values when
the numbers of groups increased (K = 2-6; FCT = 0.550.72). Petrohue River was separated out in all SAMOVA
partitions. The most geographically coherent partition
could be defined in 4 groups: (i) most continental rivers
and lakes locations including Chiloé Island (location
1 to 11), (ii) continental Petrohue river (location 9),
(iii) fjords, channels and Queulat River (locations 11 to
18) and (iv) southern-most fjords and channels (locations 19 to 21). High population structure (FST = 0.85,
p < 0.0001) was found among 21 populations and the
four groups defined. No haplotype was shared between
the four groups.

We found an overall high haplotype diversity (0.8775
+/- 0.0195) but low nucleotide diversity (0.001610 +/0.000922) for L. provocax. The expected pattern of a
lower diversity for the glaciated region was not
observed, since the haplotype diversity of the southern
group (h = 0.7873 +/- 0.0506 Table 2) was high and
comparable to that of the non-glaciated area, such as
the continental freshwater habitat (h = 0.6092 +/0.0869, Table 2) or the entire northern region (Chiloé
Island + continental rivers and lakes in Chile and
Argentina, h = 0.7220 +/- 0.0537).
The model selected for the three concatenated genes
was TrN+I, selected based on the lower value of Akaike
information criterion (AIC). The Bayesian phylogenetic
analysis (BA; Figure 3) showed two divergent clades
including haplotypes described for continental freshwater habitat, whereas haplotypes from Chiloé Island
(A.IV.A) and Nahuel Huapi (A.IV.I) belonged to a polytomous group of mixed origins. A continental freshwater clade is represented by two haplotypes widely
distributed along continental rivers and lakes (A.I.A and
A.I.B), and another one by two haplotypes (B.II.A and
C.III.A) found on Queule (39°12’S) and Petrohue rivers
(41°08’S). Another clade was represented by the majority

(A.IV.G) was found within the paraphyletic assemblage
consisting of freshwater haplotypes.
The divergence between L. felina and L. provocax was
1.5%, whereas it reached 5.2% between L. felina and
L. longicaudis, and 4.6% between L. longicaudis and

clade was 0.3%. L. provocax mean distance between
clades varied from 0.5% between a freshwater clade
(B.II.A+C.III.A) and the SFC clade, 0.4% among

distribution of the SFC haplotypes, which differs from
that expected in a recent population expansion (i.e. starlike phylogeny with retention of the ancestral haplotype). MJN indicates high divergence among haplotypes
from freshwater habitat and a lack of intermediate haplotypes. Moreover, the Bayesian skyline plot did not
show any evidence of historical population growth for
the populations from the SFC clade, but rather a recent
population decrease (Figure 5). No signature of recent
expansion was detected for L. provocax from the distribution in non-glaciated freshwater regions (D= -0.29,
P = 0.43; Fs = 1.34, P = 0.78).

Discussion
Our data evidenced a strong genetic differentiation
between continental freshwater and SFC regions. The
limits of the latter correspond not only to a habitat
change, but also to a major biogeographic break for
marine [14] and freshwater [15] species, and to the
northern limit of coastal LGM ice cover [2,3].
Southern marine fjords and channels: glacial survival?

Population displacements followed by founder effects
due to recolonization of southern areas from a northern

refuge would produce a signature of reduced genetic
diversity, when compared to northern areas. The latter
pattern was described for southern bull kelp (Durvillaea
antarctica), which has reduced genetic diversity in
southern Chile with a clear signature of postglacial
expansion [38]. In our case, phylogenetic reconstruction
for L. provocax indicates that most haplotypes from SFC
form a distinctive haplogroup emerging from a basal

northern haplotype found in freshwater habitat, which
could suggest a postglacial recolonization from the
northern freshwater refuge. However, several results
suggest a different scenario: a non-starlike network of
haplotypes from SFC, an absence of historical population growth signature from the skyline plot analysis,
high haplotype diversity, and highly divergent lineages.
These results are not in agreement with a scenario of
post-glacial expansion from northern freshwater populations. They rather support the hypothesis of a persistence of the species in this region during LGM. The
hypothesis of persistence in glaciated areas is most often
rejected by phylogeographic studies. Some studies have,
however, shown phylogeographic results strongly supporting demographic persistence in areas supposedly
covered by ice [39].
In Patagonia, iso-pollen lines indicate the existence of
a terrestrial southern refuge [4] along the south-eastern
coast of the Island of Tierra del Fuego, east from the
Beagle Channel. The presence of a southern refuge
would explain the present day plant species disjunction
between Chiloé and Magallanes, and the presence of
Bryophyta species and vascular herbaceous plants not
distributed further north of 47-48°S [40]. Nevertheless,
the unique southern glacial refugium described for terrestrial species was not supported by our data. Single or
multiple southern refugia and the persistence of the species within glaciated areas in Chilean Patagonia were
debated for terrestrial [7-9,34,35,41-46] and freshwater
species [10-13,47,49]. In the case of temperate forest
species, patches persisted either at the northern limits of
ice cover in Chile or on the eastern limits of ice sheet in
Argentinean Patagonia [34,35,42,44,48]. All these examples point to a post-glacial colonization of western Patagonia, i.e. the Chilean side of the Andes. The survival of
L. provocax in non-glaciated areas of the eastern side of
the Andes would have required a recolonization of the
species across the Andes at multiple sites in order to
allow the re-introduction of such a high genetic diversity. In addition, because the species currently occurs
only in the Nahuel Huapi and Limay River area in continental Argentina [24-26], subsequent localised extinctions of L. provocax along most of the eastern refugia
would be required to support such a scenario. Lastly,
the unique Argentinean haplotype (A.IV.I) is derived
from haplotype A.IV.A present in Chiloe Island, suggesting that its distribution was likely widespread in the
recent past, and that range expansion was more likely
from Chile to the eastern side of the Andes. Thus, the
results do not support an origin of L. provocax diversity
from eastern Patagonia.
On the other hand, glacial refugia on western coast of
the Andes were suggested for some freshwater species.
MtDNA sequences of the fishes Galaxias platei and

Page 8 of 12

G. maculatus along the western side of the Andes
mountain (39°-49°S) suggest that these species survived
in small southern sites due to discontinuities of the ice
field [12,49]. Also, exposed portions of the Pacific continental shelf could have constituted favourable environment for such aquatic species [12]. Similarly, the
freshwater crab Aegla alacalufi seem to have survived in
glaciated areas, at least in a site identified as the El
Amarillo hot springs, which was possibly left uncovered
by glacial ice [13].
Whether multiple refugia existed or L. provocax survived all along the western southern Patagonia during
LGM is still a matter of debate. The persistence of
L. provocax is dependent on terrestrial habitat for dens
(shelter) and on aquatic habitat for food availability.
Such habitat was probably available on the eastern side
of the Andes, as suggested by the extension of the distribution of Fitzroya cupressoides [34], allowing the survival of L. provocax in a large area and therefore allowing
the persistence of high genetic diversity. In the SFC,
L. provocax is known to feed not only on crustaceans
and sea urchins, but also on intertidal and subtidal
fishes (46% of its diet) [28]. Ice scour can eliminate
intertidal and shallow water benthos in the Southern
Ocean [50]. In the case of complete elimination of intertidal resources, diet could have been based on species
such as the freshwater fish (Galaxias platei and
G. maculatus), catfish (Trichomycterus areolatus) or the
freshwater crab (Aegla alacalufi), which survived in the
area during LGM [12,13,47,49], or subtidal organisms.
Otter species, such as North American river otter (Lontra candensis), the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) and the
sea otter (Enhydra lutris), are distributed throughout
extreme cold environments. L. canadensis inhabiting the
marine environments in Alaska has access to two major
types of prey: intertidal-demersal organisms such as
fishes (Cottidae, Hexagrammidae) and crustaceans, and
seasonally available schooling pelagic fishes [51]. Similarly, L. provocax populations could have shifted their
diet according to prey availability and thus persisted
during the LGM in the Patagonian SFC. Although species such as the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) show evidence of a unique glacial refuge and low genetic
diversity [52], other mustelids were able to survive during LGM. Gulo gulo, Mustela nivalis and Mustela erminea show adaptations for survival in Pleistocene
conditions [53].
Southern glacial refugia or adaptation to marine habitat

Our data show a monophyletic haplogroup for most
haplotypes from the SFC range of L. provocax (43°S to
53°S), distinct from freshwater habitat haplotypes. Such
differences between the L. provocax populations inhabiting the freshwater and marine environments suggest

Vianna et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:53
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/53

either past genetic isolation, and/or restricted gene flow
between them at the present time, allowing genetic drift
or natural selection to operate. Changes in the L. provocax diet and a greater ability to swim larger distances as
required in the SFC could eventually lead to adaptation
to the marine environment, if plasticity is limited. However, patterns of genetic diversity generated by gene
surfing during recolonization are similar to those generated by selection and could thus be mistakenly interpreted as adaptive events [54]. Similarly to selection and
unlike most other demographic effects, gene surfing
generally does not affect all loci, and thus seems especially difficult to distinguish from directional selection
[55]. All otter species, except the sea otter (Enhydra
lutris) and the chungungo (Lontra felina), are dependent
of freshwater habitat [20]. Nevertheless, freshwater
sources are abundant in SFC and L. provocax can temporarily return to rivers to access a supply of fresh
water. Moreover, all but four freshwater otter species
have also been recorded along the coast [20] (Lontra
canadensis, Lutra lutra and Lontra longicaudis, among
others). Nevertheless, no genetic surveys have been conducted to determine divergence of otter lineages from
different environments. Lontra phylogeny based on
mtDNA markers revealed the recent divergence between
L. provocax and L. felina about 883,000 years ago (95%
HPD: 0.16-1.89 mya) with a possible speciation of L.
felina from L. provocax living on SFC [37]. This speciation scenario is in agreement with the adaptation
hypothesis of L. provocax to the marine habitat in SFC.
Conservation implications

Although higher haplotype diversity was expected along
northern populations due to the persistence of rivers
and forests, low haplotype diversity (compared to SFC)
but high divergence among haplotypes was observed.
Our results are concordant with the hypothesis of a
recent loss of genetic diversity in freshwater environments due to hunting and habitat destruction. This is
specifically supported by: i) A.I.A haplotype shared
among several locations; ii) two highly divergent clades;
iii) two divergent haplotypes (A.I.A and B.II.A) in the
Queule River. Genetic theory predicts that during population bottlenecks low frequency alleles are lost by
genetic drift [56]. Similarly, L. provocax intermediate
haplotypes are not seen on the MJN, suggesting that
they were eliminated within the freshwater range. This
pattern is consistent with the history of the L. provocax
populations in the region. Indeed, L. provocax populations have been eliminated from the north of its past
range. The northern limit of distribution changed from
Cauquenes and Cachapoal rivers (34°S) to Tolten River
basin (39°S) [21]. Its small geographical range has been
strongly impacted by anthropogenic activities resulting

Page 9 of 12

in a decline to less than 10% of its former distribution
in freshwater habitats. L. provocax was intensively
hunted for its fur; and hunting continued until the
1970’s in some southern localities [21]. Furthermore, the
species activity has been significantly reduced in areas
where riparian vegetation was removed or watercourses
were disturbed or recently polluted by pulp factories
[57,58]. Riparian vegetation significantly influences the
presence of crustaceans and consequently the occurrence of L. provocax in the area [30,32,57].
The reduction in the distribution of L. provocax led to
the classification of the species in Chile as ‘’endangered’’
in the northern range between the O’Higgins and Los
Lagos regions, in rivers and lakes, and ‘’insufficiently
known’’ for the Aysén and Magallanes regions, where distribution was largely marine [59]. Although L. provocax
in freshwater habitats mostly occur below 300 m altitude
[33], the majority of National Parks and Reserves (> 90%)
in south-central Chile (35.6° to 41.3°S) are located above
600 m altitude [48], and therefore do not serve the
conservation of this species.
Our data shows that the survival of the species along
SFC during glacial cycles maintained a high diversity
along SFC. Large-scale temperate deforestation in Chile
has progressed from north to south [60]. Human populations are concentrated in the central-south region of
Chile, and are less dense south of Chiloé Island. Thus,
southern L. provocax populations have not been greatly
impacted by anthropogenic actions, and have maintained high genetic diversity compared to northern
freshwater populations. L. provocax populations along
SFC are, however, barely studied, and increasing human
activities in this area are a potential threat to these
populations.

Conclusions
Our results evidenced the persistence of a semi-aquatic
carnivore species, the huillín, in western Patagonia along
areas covered by ice sheet during LGM. Marine habitat
of the SFC played an important role for L. provocax survival during LGM, probably associated to the survival of
other freshwater and marine species that may have
represented a persistent food source for the huillín.
Therefore, genetic differentiation between northern
exclusively freshwater habitat dominated by riparian
vegetation and SFC may be explained by some ecological differentiation between both kinds of habitats. This
is an interesting clue for understanding why so many
aquatic species seem to have persisted in glaciated areas.
Methods
Study area, sample collection and DNA extraction

A total of 57 feces and 18 tissue samples were collected.
These included blood from captured animals, muscle

Vianna et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:53
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/53

from carcasses of animals that died of natural causes,
and pelts confiscated by authorities due to illegal hunting. Feces and muscle tissue were preserved in pure
ethanol. The sampling range included the full range of
the species (Figure 1) from the northern limit in Chile,
the Huilio River tributary of Tolten river (38°58’S) to
southern Patagonia (53°08’S, Table 1, Figure 1, 2). In
addition we sample the only known population of the
eastern side of the Andes: the Nahuel Huapi Area.
A total of 21 locations were sampled, nine in continental rivers and lakes (CRL), two in rivers from Chiloé
Island (CI) and ten marine locations in the fjords and
channels (SFC).
PCR amplification

Mitochondrial DNA control region (CR), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 5 (ND5) gen and cythocrome b (Cytb) gen were amplified using primers described by [37]:
LfCR-2F and LfCR-1R; ND5-DF1 and LfND5-R; and
LfCYTB-1F; LfCYTB-1F; LfCYTB-2F and LfCYTB-2R.
PCR reactions were carried out following [37]. PCR
amplification was confirmed by electrophoresis of products with ethidium bromide in 0.8% agarose gels and
visualization under UV light. Amplicons were purified
using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and
sequenced using amplification primers by Macrogen
Inc., Seoul, Korea. All sequences have been deposited in
the GenBank [GenBank: GQ843803-GQ843824, and
HM997011-HM997017].
Data analysis
Population analysis

The sequences were aligned and mutations were confirmed by eye according to the chromatogram using
Proseq ver. 2.91 [61]. All sequences were aligned and
haplotypes were identified using ClustalX ver. 1.83 [62].
Spatial analysis of molecular variance (SAMOVA) was
implemented by SAMOVA ver. 1.0 [63] to define groups
based on the geographic distribution of the genetic
diversity. SAMOVA were performed for 21 locations
testing from 2 to 7 groups, each of which with 100
initial conditions. The groups of populations geographically homogeneous are defined by maximizing F CT
values (among group variance) and minimizing F SC
values (among populations within group variance). Haplotype (h) and nucleotide diversity (π) were calculated
using Arlequin program ver. 3.0 [64] for all data set and
for the different environments.
Deviations from a neutral Wright-Fisher model were
performed by calculating Tajima’s D and Fu’s Fs statistics [65,66]. We tested the demographic [67] and spatial
expansion [68] models by calculating the sum of
squared differences (SSD) between the observed and an
estimated mismatch distribution obtained by 1,000

Page 10 of 12

bootstrap. The P-value of the SSD statistic was calculated as the proportion of simulated cases that show a
SSD value distinctive from the original. Calculations
were performed in ARLEQUIN, using 1,000 bootstrap
to evaluate significance. To estimate the shape of population growth through time for the individuals distributed along the ice sheet coverage area during the LGM,
we constructed Bayesian skyline plots implemented in
BEAST v 1.4.8 [69]. The appropriate model of nucleotide substitution was HKY+I determined using ModelTest ver. 3.06 [70]. Five million iterations were
performed, of which the model parameters were
sampled every 1000 iterations. Throughout our analysis,
we assumed a within-lineage per site mutation rate of
6%Ma. Demographic plots for each analysis were visualized using Tracer v1.0.1 [69].
Phylogenetic analysis

We applied the Partition Homogeineity test (10,000 permutation) to assess the congruence of the evolution
rates among CR, ND5 and Cytb using PAUP ver. 4.0b8
[71]. The evolutionary relationship among concatenated
CR+ND5+Cyt-b haplotypes was investigated by a Median Joining Network using Network ver. 4.5.1.0 [72], and
phylogenetic reconstructions based on Bayesian (BA)
methods. Four divergent haplotypes of Lontra felina
[37], were incorporated in the phylogenetic reconstruction, whereas a L. longicaudis haplotype from the Amazon (this manuscript) was used as an outgroup. The
substitution model of DNA evolution was selected based
on AIC using Modeltest ver. 3.06 [69]. BA was performed by MrBayes ver. 3.1.2 [73] using the general
type of the best fit model parameters defined for the
data set, in which four independent analyses were run
with four chains each, for six million generations and
then sampled at intervals of 1,000 generations. The first
25% of sampled trees were discarded to ensure stabilization and the remaining used to compute a consensus
tree. The split frequency was below 0.004, confirming
that sampling was from the posterior probability distribution. Mean distance between clades and species was
calculated using Mega v.3.1 [74] using p-distance.
