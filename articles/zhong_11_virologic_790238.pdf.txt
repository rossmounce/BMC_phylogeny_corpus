Abstract
Background: The association of hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes/subgenotypes with clinical characteristics is
increasingly recognized. However, the virologic and clinical features of HBV genotypes/subgenotypes in pediatric
patients remain largely unknown.
Methods: Four hundred and eighty-seven pediatric inpatients with CHB were investigated, including 217 nucleos(t)
ide analog-experienced patients. HBV genotypes/subgenotypes and reverse transcriptase (RT) mutations were
determined by direct sequencing. The stage of fibrosis and degree of inflammatory activity were evaluated by the
Metavir score system.
Results: Among 487 enrolled pediatric patients, HBV genotype C2 and B2 were the most two prevalent (73.7%
and 21.1%). Comparing with HBV/B2 infected patients, no significant difference was observed in the incidence rate
and mutant patterns of lamivudine- or adefovir-resistant mutations in HBV/C2 infected patients (P > 0.05).
Importantly, we found that the degree of hepatic inflammation degree, fibrosis stage and ALT level were
significantly higher in HBV/C2-infected HBeAg positive patients than it was in HBV/B2-infected ones.
Conclusions: The pediatric patients with HBV/C2 infection might be more susceptible to develop severe liver
pathogenesis.

Background
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection remains a serious
health problem that approximately one third of the
world’s population has serological evidence of past or
present infection with HBV and 350 million people are
chronically infected. As a highly endemic area for HBV
infection, it is estimated that 93 million people are
infected with HBV in China [1-3]. Approximately 90%
adults with chronic acquired the infection from infancy
or in early childhood [4]. HBV as a highly variable virus
is at least classified into eight genotypes based on a

divergence in the entire nucleotide sequence greater
than 8% [3-21]. Each HBV genotype can be further
divided into subgenotypes on the basis of a greater than
4% but less than 8% divergence in the complete nucleotide sequence [3,12,14,22]. As of now, HBV/B, HBV/C,
and HBV/D have been individually classified into five
subgenotypes each, HBV/B1 to B5 [3,23], HBV/C1 to
C5 [3,24,25] and HBV/D1 to D5 [3,24]. Some investigations indicated that C1 and C2 were predominant subgenotypes in the southern and northern parts of China,
respectively [14,26-29]. Although the prevalence and
clinical features of HBV genotypes/subgenotypes have
been investigated in adult patients [3,9,30], However,
the virologic and clinical features of HBV genotypes/
subgenotypes in Chinese pediatric patients remain largely unknown.

Methods
Patients

Four hundred and eighty-seven pediatric inpatients with
CHB who visited Beijing 302 Hospital from September
2007 to September 2010 were enrolled in the study.
They were mainly from different regions of Northern
China, All patients were anti-HCV and anti-HIV negative (375 males, 112 females, mean age 12 ± 5.7 years;
range 3-18 years). The diagnostic and treatment criteria
were based on “European Association for the Study of
the Liver”, 2009, EASL clinical practice guidelines: management of chronic hepatitis B [1]. For all patients,
there was no evidence of HCC, concomitant of HCV,
HDV, and HIV infection, metastatic or autoimmune
liver disease. Two hundred and seventeen patients were
exposed to nucleos(t)ide analog(s). The inclusion criteria
were: all patients who were serum HBsAg positive for at
least 6 months, but there was no evidence for HCC, or
concomitant of HCV, HDV, HIV infection and autoimmune liver disease. The excluded criteria were: patients
with acute hepatitis A, B, HCV, HDV, or HIV co-infection, and drug induced acute hepatitis, existence of
renal failure, hepatic decompensation or psychiatric disorders, and central nervous system disease such as epilepsy, had received bone marrow or organ transplants,
or had received immunosuppressive, nephrotoxic, or
hepatotoxic medications within 2 months of enrollment.
The study protocol was approved by the Beijing 302
Hospital Research Ethnics Committee, and written
informed consents for therapy and study were obtained
from each patient’s parents.
Detection of Serological Markers and Analysis of HBV
Sequence

Serological markers and quantitation of HBV DNA,
serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), and other biochemical parameters were measured by standard
procedures. HBeAg/anti-HBe, HBsAg/anti-HBs and
anti-HBc were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent (Kewei Diagnostic Ltd., Beijing, China) or chemiluminescent assay (Abbott Laboratories, North Chicago,

IL, USA). HBV DNA level was determined by a realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit (Fosun Pharmaceutical Co., Shanghai, China) with a lower limit of
detection of 500 copies/mL (about 100 IU/mL). HBV
genotype/subgenotype assignment was based on the
analysis of the 1225 bp-long S/Pol-gene sequence (nt
54-1278) as described previously [31]. The sense and
antisense primers designed respectively for the firstround PCR were desigened respectively followed [3].
Direct sequencing was performed using an ABI 3730xl
DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
Phylogenetic and molecular analyses were performed in
MEGA version 4.0 [32]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis with bootstrap test confirmation performed on 1000 resampling
standard reference sequences were acquired from the
online Hepatitis Virus Database which can be found at:
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genotyping/formpage.cgi.
Analysis of Genotypic/Subgenotypic Drug Mutations

Drug-resistance-associated mutations in the RT region
of the HBV genome were analyzed as previously
described [31]. Substitutions at positions rt80, rt173,
rt180, rt181, rt204, rt214, rt229, rt233 and rt236 were
taken as resistance-associated mutations for analysis.
Analysis of Histopathological

The stage of fibrosis and the degree of inflammatory
activity were evaluated by the Metavir score system [5],
which classifies fibrosis into five stages: F0-no fibrosis,
F1-portal fibrosis without septa, F2-portal fibrosis with
few septa, F3-portal fibrosis with numerous septa, without cirrhosis, F4-cirrhosis. The degrees of inflammatory
activity were divided into: A0-lack of histological activity, A1-mild histological activity, A2-moderate histological activity, A3-severe histological activity.
Statistical Analysis

Measurement data were expressed as means ± standard
deviations. Differences in Measurement data were examined
by Student’s t test and analysis of variance; the numeration

Results
The main characteristics and the frequencies of the viral
subgenotypes in the 487 pediatric patients are shown in
Table 1. Among 487 enrolled pediatric patients, eighty-one
percent of the patients were HBeAg positive (76.4% genotypes C; 22.3% B; 1.3% D), about 60% of them had alanine
aminotransferase of up to 1.5 times the normal level (upper
limit 40 U/L). As shown in Table 1, the subgenotype distribution was as follows: 1 (0.2%) for B1, 103 (21.1%) for B2
(for example: FJ621698, FJ621673, FJ621664, FJ621732,
FJ621700, FJ621781, FJ621753, FJ621734, FJ621672,
FJ621669, etc.), and 1 (0.2%) for B3, 3 (0.6%) for B4 (for
example: FJ621693 and FJ621699), 7 (1.4%) for C1 (for
example: FJ621879, FJ622823, etc.), 359 (73.7%) for C2 (for
example: FJ622585, FJ386652, FJ622577, FJ621948,
FJ386584, FJ622844, FJ386583, FJ622013, FJ386632,
FJ622539, FJ622092, etc.), 5 (1.0%) for C3 (for example:
FJ622096, FJ622627, etc.), 2 (0.4%) for C4, and 6 (1.2%) for
D. No other genotypes (A, E, F, G, or H) were detected in
enrolled samples enrolled for this study. Thus, HBV/C2
was the most predominant subgenotype among enrolled
patients, followed by HBV/B2. A phylogenetic tree based
on the 43 representative HBV genetic sequences, analyzed
with GenBank accession numbers is presented in Figure 1.
No obvious differences were observed in age, gender,
serum HBV DNA level, TBIL, and HBeAg positive rate
between HBV/C2 and HBV/B2 infected patients.
Among 217 nucleos(t)ide analog-experienced patients,
a comparison of drug-resistant mutational patterns
between HBV/B2 and HBV/C2 showed that the incidence rate and mutant patterns of LAM-resistant or
ADV-resistant mutations were similar between the two
subsets, and no significant difference was found (P >
0.05) (Tables 2 and 3).
Among the 487 pediatric inpatients with CHB, 187
HBeAg positive patients who were submitted to liver
biopsy, the mean degree of inflammation was determined
for HBV/C2 and HBV/B2 patients (2.1 ± 0.4 vs 1.6 ± 0.4),
and the mean stage of fibrosis was determined for HBV/
C2 and HBV/B2 patients (1.9 ± 0.89 vs 1.3 ± 0.6). The
mean degree of inflammation, the stage of fibrosis and
the ALT level in HBV/C2 patients were significantly
higher than in HBV/B2 patients (P < 0.05) (Table 4). The
sample size of HBeAg-negative patients was too small to
be analyzed. Factors (such as sex, age, routes of infection,
therapeutic effects) that can be affect the degree of
inflammation, the stage of fibrosis and ALT level of
HBV/B2, C2 patients have been analyzed by multiple
logistic regression, and the results indicated that there is
no statistically significant difference between them.
Discussion and conclusions
HBV genotypes/subgenotypes have been reported to
have various effects on the clinical course of patients

with HBV related liver diseases [2,4,7,9,13,18,21,33-37].
However, most of previous study data were from adult
patients, studies on the pediatric patients were rare,
especially in China. To our knowledge, there were seldom study to analyze the relationship among the genotypes/subgenotypes and NA resistance as well as the
disease progression in pediatric patients. The relationship between HBV genotypes/subgenotypes and NA
resistance, as well as the disease progression in pediatric
patients, were analyzed in this study.
The data obtained from adult patients indicate that
HBV genotypes/subgenotypes have distinct geographic
distributions patterns [2,8,15,16,18,20-22,27,37-42]. Genotypes B and C are the most common HBV genotypes
in China [14,28]. Our results indicate that among the
487 pediatric patients with CHB, HBV genotype C was
the most prevalent (76.4%), while genotypes B and D
were found in 22.3% and 1.3%, respectively. Genotypes
E, F, G and H were not found. About 60% of these
patients had ALT up to 1.5 times the normal level. The
prevalence and the geographical pattern of the genotypes/subgenotypes of our pediatric patients were in
consistent with previous reports in adults [3,41]. In
addition, there were no significant genotypes/subgenotypes differences were found in age, gender, in serum
HBV DNA levels, TBIL, and in HBeAg-positive rate
among patients infected with HBV/B2 and HBV/C2.
NA are commonly used in clinical treatment for suppressing viral replication to halt the progression of liver
diseases caused by chronic HBV infection [3,4,42,43].
The clinical implications of occurring HBV subgenotypes are far from well understood, especially in pediatric patients. Previous studies about adults exhibited

that HBV/B2 differ from to HBV/C2 in LAM- or from
ADV-resistant mutational patterns [3], suggesting that
HBV subgenotypes might have an impact on drug resistance. However, when we compared the association of
LAM- or ADV- resistance mutational rates with HBV/
B2 and HBV/C2 in pediatric patients respectively, we
did not find significant differences between the two
groups. The difference between adults and pediatric
patients in this respect may be explained by following
reasons: (1) adult patients possibly have a longer time of
infection and therapy than do pediatric patients, which
may increase the incidence rate and extent of NArelated resistance mutations. (2) The different host’s
immune response to the virus between the adults and
pediatric patients determines the extent of NA resistant
rates and patterns [2]. Additional large population-based
studies are needed to confirm this inference.
In this study, we also analyzed the relationship
between subgenotypes and disease progression. We
found that HBV/B2 patients had a significantly lower
incidence of inflammation and fibrosis than HBV/C2 in
pediatric patients. Moreover, in our previous studies, the
double mutation in BCP (T1762/A1764) was obviously
more frequent in genotype C (26%) than that in genotype B patients (9.8%, P < 0.05). However, there was no
significant difference in preC (A1896) between genotype
B (3.7%) and genotype C (2.8%, P > 0.05). According to
the relevant literature, there are some correlations
between the mutation in HBV BCP region and disease
progression [44].
In conclusion, HBV/C2 is the most predominant subgenotype in pediatric patients of Northern China. Pediatric patients with subgenotype C2 virus might be more

therapeutic decisions might not be based primarily on
genotypes/subgenotypes in pediatric patients at present.
Our results provide new insights in features of HBV
subgenotypes which may have important clinical implications for the management of HBV infections in pediatric patients.
