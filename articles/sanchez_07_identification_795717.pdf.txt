Abstract
Background: Since its discovery around deep sea hydrothermal vents of the Galapagos Rift about
30 years ago, the chemoautotrophic symbiosis between the vestimentiferan tubeworm Riftia
pachyptila and its symbiotic sulfide-oxidizing γ-proteobacteria has been extensively studied.
However, studies on the tubeworm host were essentially targeted, biochemical approaches. We
decided to use a global molecular approach to identify new proteins involved in metabolite
exchanges and assimilation by the host. We used a Subtractive Suppression Hybridization approach
(SSH) in an unusual way, by comparing pairs of tissues from a single individual. We chose to identify
the sequences preferentially expressed in the branchial plume tissue (the only organ in contact with
the sea water) and in the trophosome (the organ housing the symbiotic bacteria) using the body
wall as a reference tissue because it is supposedly not involved in metabolite exchanges in this
species.
Results: We produced four cDNA libraries: i) body wall-subtracted branchial plume library (BRBW), ii) and its reverse library, branchial plume-subtracted body wall library (BW-BR), iii) body
wall-subtracted trophosome library (TR-BW), iv) and its reverse library, trophosome-subtracted
body wall library (BW-TR). For each library, we sequenced about 200 clones resulting in 45
different sequences on average in each library (58 and 59 cDNAs for BR-BW and TR-BW libraries
respectively). Overall, half of the contigs matched records found in the databases with good Evalues. After quantitative PCR analysis, it resulted that 16S, Major Vault Protein, carbonic anhydrase
(RpCAbr), cathepsin and chitinase precursor transcripts were highly represented in the branchial
plume tissue compared to the trophosome and the body wall tissues, whereas carbonic anhydrase
(RpCAtr), myohemerythrin, a putative T-Cell receptor and one non identified transcript were
highly specific of the trophosome tissue.
Conclusion: Quantitative PCR analyses were congruent with our libraries results thereby
confirming the existence of tissue-specific transcripts identified by SSH. We focused our study on
the transcripts we identified as the most interesting ones based on the BLAST results. Some of the
keys to understanding metabolite exchanges may remain in the sequences we could not identify
(hypothetical proteins and no similarity found). These sequences will have to be better studied by
a longer -or complete- sequencing to check their identity, and then by verifying the expression level
of the transcripts in different parts of the worm.

Background
The vestimentiferan annelid Riftia pachyptila lives around
hydrothermal vents on the East Pacific Rise at 2600
meters-depth. These giant tubeworms form dense aggregations and constitute a major component of the biomass
in these deep-sea oases of life that rely on chemosynthetic
primary production [1]. Adult vestimentiferans lack a
mouth, gut and anus [2]. Instead, they possess a specialized tissue, called trophosome, that contains symbiotic
bacteria. This symbiosis with sulfide-oxidizing bacteria
provides all the host's nutrition and is therefore obligatory
[3]. Their larvae however, possess a digestive tract [4], and
are devoid of symbiotic bacteria which they acquire from
the environment. The acquisition of bacteria occurs
through the skin, and the trophosome is established from
mesodermal tissue. Then, apoptosis of infected cells in the
host epidermis occurs at the end of the colonization process [5].
Several studies focused on the functioning of this symbiosis. Previous biochemical and enzymatic studies
addressed the uptake of hydrogen sulfide [6,7] and the
transport of both oxygen and hydrogen sulfide by the
giant extracellular hemoglobins [8-10]. The diffusion of
carbon dioxide through the branchial plume [11] and its
subsequent conversion into bicarbonate through the
activity of carbonic anhydrase [12,13] were also demonstrated. More recently, molecular techniques were used to
better understand some aspects of the exchange mechanisms in the branchial plume and the trophosome, such
as the existence of a carbonic anhydrase transcript[14].
The sequencing of the whole genome of the symbiont of
Riftia pachyptila is currently under progress (Horst Felbeck,
personal communication) and a proteomics approach has
been carried out on the symbiont [15] revealing previously unsuspected carbon fixation pathways. However,
no global genomic work on the host has been published
to date.
Identification of differentially-expressed transcripts (i.e.
transcripts which differ in abundance between samples
being compared) has been conducted for the last ten years
on symbiotic interactions between rhizobia and legumes
(for review see [16]) thanks to improved molecular
approaches such as Subtractive Suppression Hybridization (SSH), for example. Morel and coworkers [17] constructed cDNA libraries by a SSH procedure and
performed hybridizations on arrays between two compartments of the fungus Paxillus involutus living in symbiosis with the plant Betula pendula. These methods
successfully identified differentially-expressed sequences
in this ectomycorrhizal symbiosis, suggesting differences
in metabolism between the two studied compartments
[17]. SSH appears to be a quick and efficient method to
rapidly obtain many specific sequences. It is a powerful

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/337

method to enrich samples for differentially expressed
transcripts by combining steps of suppression and normalization prior to differential screening, and this starting
from very little material.
A transcriptome analysis of a marine cnidarian-dinoflagellate symbiosis using microarrays to compare aposymbiotic and symbiotic stages of the host Anthopleura
elegantissima revealed the existence of key genes involved
in the maintenance of the symbiosis [18].
In Riftia pachyptila, aposymbiotic larvae/post-larvae are
very small (less than 100 µm) and very difficult to obtain.
In addition, the host cannot be kept alive without its symbionts. Therefore, comparison between aposymbiotic and
symbiotic states in R. pachyptila cannot be considered at
present. Previous studies on the host were only targeted
molecular studies and no global molecular analysis has
been carried out on the host Riftia pachyptila to date. The
aim of the present study was to identify host transcripts
that could be involved in metabolite exchanges in the
branchial plume on the one hand, and in metabolite
exchanges with the symbionts in the trophosome. We
postulated that these specific protein-coding genes should
be preferentially expressed in these two tissues that are
directly involved in the symbiotic way of life. Instead of
the usual application of SSH that compares the same tissue in two physiological states, we compared pairs of tissues from a single individual. The subtracted libraries
obtained should therefore be enriched in specific
sequences compared to a classical library without any subtraction procedure. In theory, identical sequences
between key tissue and the reference tissue (housekeeping
genes sequences in particular) should be eliminated by
the subtractive suppression hybridization. Only tissuespecific sequences should be recovered in each library. We
also maximized the chances of obtaining new sequences
using the normalization procedure which increases the
amount of rare transcripts during the SSH procedure.

Results
General results of sequencing
Global results including the total number of obtained
sequences, contigs, singletons, and redundancy rates are
given in Table 1 for all the libraries (the body wall-subtracted branchial plume library (BR-BW), the branchial
plume-subtracted body wall library (BW-BR), the body
wall-subtracted trophosome library (TR-BW) and the trophosome-subtracted body wall library (BW-TR)). The
redundancy rates of the libraries range from 80.5 to 95.6
%. This indicates that additional sequencing should bring
few or no new sequences. The sequences obtained were
assembled into 58, 45, 59 and 17 different sequences
(each putatively representing one cDNA) respectively for

each library. Of those, 38, 17, 36 and 6 appeared as singletons, respectively.
Figure 1 shows the proportion of sequences with homology or not in the GenBank protein database for the four
libraries: BR-BW (Fig. 1A), BW-BR (Fig. 1B), TR-BW (Fig.
1C) and BW-TR (Fig. 1D). These sequences are split into
different categories: 1) mitochondrial sequences, 2) all
processes sequences (with E-value < 1), 3) hypothetical
sequences (with E-value < 1), 4) hypothetical sequences
(with E-value > 1) and 5) no similarity found. If we consider that the two last categories cannot improve our
knowledge, it remains that the proportions of cDNAs
which matched with good homologies scores in GenBank
database are 54.2 % in the BR-BW, 54.6 % in the BW-BR,
45.9 % in the TR-BW and 70.6 % in the BW-TR libraries.
The choice of E-value = 1 as the threshold to assess the
degree of similarity to protein sequences in GenBank
database is arbitrary: we are well aware that E-values of 103 to 10-5 are usually chosen but, given that the sequences
we obtained are relatively short and that there is little
molecular data on vestimentiferans or annelids in general,
we decided to use this high threshold. For example some
cytochrome c sequences (BRbwC9) showed high E-values
(0.11, see Table 2) although sequence identity reached
81% based on a 16 amino acid alignment.
Specific sequences obtained from each subtracted library
Subtracted branchial plume library (BR-BW)
Fig. 1A shows a strikingly high proportion of mitochondrial sequences (62.4%) compared to what is observed in
the three other libraries. Table 2 shows the sequences with
the best E-values for the sequences obtained from the
branchial plume library. First of all, among the most
redundant clones, we found a 16S ribosomal mitochondrion sequence, which appeared highly redundant (contigs 1 and 2, corresponding to two fragments of mt16S,
contain 78 and 32 sequences, respectively). High homologies scores were obtained for several contigs, in particular contigs 12 (carbonic anhydrase), 13 (Major Vault
Protein), 14 (chitinase precursor), 15 (cathepsin L-like),
16 (BTG1 protein), 17 (α-tubuline), 18 (hydroxylamine
reductase), and 24 (super cystein rich protein). The carbonic anhydrase cDNA obtained in the branchial plume
(hereafter referred to as RpCAbr) was different from the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/337

one already sequenced from a trophosome cDNA sample
[12] (hereafter referred to as RpCAtr). The RpCAbr fulllength sequence (GenBank:EF490380, [19]) is only 66%
identical in amino acids to RpCAtr (GenBank:AJ439711,
[12]).
Subtracted body wall library (BW-BR)
The sequencing of the reciprocal library (i.e. BW-BR)
revealed only 3 cDNAs in common with the BR-BW
library: the two sections of the mitochondrial rRNA 16S
large subunit (although they form a smaller proportion of
the sequences), and the branchial carbonic anhydrase
(RpCAbr) cDNAs. Although it was not the main target,
this library yielded interesting sequences involved in the
formation of the tube and therefore expected to be specific
of the body-wall (Table 3), including a Riftia pachyptila
exoskeleton β-chitin-binding transcript (contig 9) almost
identical (2 differences over 74 amino acids aligned) to
the one sequenced by Chamoy and coworkers [20]. We
also obtained a different exoskeleton β-chitin-binding
transcript (contig 10) with a highest homology score with
the previously sequenced one [20]. Surprisingly, contig 11
showed a high homology with galaxin, a protein present
in the calcified exoskeleton of the coral Galaxea fascicularis. Two transcripts coding for respiratory proteins were
also found in this library: a new extracellular hemoglobin
linker (contig 14) [21] which matches with Sabella spallanzanii linker chain sequence, and an intracellular globin
(contig 15).
Subtracted trophosome library (TR-BW)
Sequences obtained from this library were compared to
the unpublished genomic sequences of the symbiont
(with Horst Felbeck permission) in order to verify that
they were host-specific, and not a contamination from the
symbionts that are contained in this tissue. The trophosome library yielded much less identifiable sequences
(Table 4). Noticeably, among the identifiable sequences,
we recovered the previously sequenced carbonic anhydrase transcript (RpCAtr) [12], and transcripts coding for
a large number of globin chains (contigs 8–15), for a
hemoglobin linker (contig 16), and for a myohemerythrin (contig 17). Among the cDNAs with a significant blast
value (all processes sequences (E-value<1)), more than 56
% are respiratory pigment protein transcripts. These latter

are partial fragments of the already known A1, A2, B1, B2
chains of the giant extracellular hemoglobin of Riftia pachyptila, and a probably new A2 (contig 12) and B1 (contig
14) chains. The extracellular hemoglobin linker identified
here (contig 16) is different from the one identified in the
BW-BR library. This brings the number of known partial
linkers cDNAs up to three out of the four known types of
linker chains [22]. A sequence coding for a serine-threonine rich protein was also found and matches with a T-cell
receptor protein sequence (contig 18, E-value = 0.58).
Among the unknown sequences, the most abundant contig was composed of 24 sequences (contig 27).

Subtracted body wall library (BW-TR)
Overall, the general results found for the BW-TR library
(Table 5) are similar to those found for the BW-BR library
(Table 3) although with a lower number of contigs. However, given the very large number of exoskeleton β-chitinbinding sequences (contig 3 and 4, comprising 24 and 59
sequences, respectively), we can suspect a less efficient
normalization for these transcripts. The exoskeleton βchitin-binding transcripts, galaxin, and myosin chains
found in this library are the same as those found in the
BW-BR library.

Checking the subtraction procedure and the specificity of
the libraries
We only found 3 common cDNAs between the BR-BW
and BW-BR libraries and 2 common cDNAs between the
TR-BW and BW-TR ones. We were able to assess the degree
of successful subtraction for several transcripts by performing regular PCR on subtracted and unsubtracted
poly-A cDNA pools. Some results are shown in Fig. 2.

The profiles of abundant tissue-specific transcripts are presented in Fig. 2A (exoskeleton β-chitin-binding transcript)
and 2B (galaxin transcript). The exoskeleton β-chitinbinding transcript was clearly present in the body wall tissue (Fig. 2A) in both unsubtracted cDNA sample and subtracted BW-BR cDNA sample (before and after SSH

procedure respectively). The same profile was obtained
for the galaxin transcript (Fig. 2B).
Typical profiles of enrichment of transcripts after SSH procedure are shown in Fig. 2C,D. The chitinase precursor
sequence is enriched by the SSH, appearing on agarose gel
after 28 cycles instead of 33 cycles on the branchial plume
cDNA (Fig. 2C) and RpCAtr sequence amplification is visible after 18 cycles instead of 28 cycles from the trophosome cDNA before the SSH procedure (Fig. 2D).
Fig. 2E and 2F show typical profiles of amplification of
rare transcripts. RpCAbr amplification can be seen on the
BW-TR cDNA pool after 23 cycles and not from the body
wall unsubtracted cDNA, even at 33 cycles (Fig. 2E).
Amplification of the intracellular globin sequence can be

seen on the BW-BR cDNA pool after 23 cycles and not
from the body wall unsubtracted cDNA, even after 40
cycles (Fig. 2F).
Fig. 2G shows results of the amplification profile of MVP.
This transcript appeared abundant in one tissue (the
branchial plume) and rare in another (the body wall).
Only the subtraction procedure allowed its detection in
the body wall (not detected in the unsubtracted sample,
even after 33 cycles).
Finally, Fig. 2H illustrates the difference of SSH efficiency
of a same transcript in two different subtraction procedures (BR-BW and BW-BR). A successful amplification of

cytochrome c oxidase I (ccox I) was obtained in both
branchial plume and body wall unsubtracted cDNA pools
after 18 and 23 cycles respectively. No amplification was
observed in the BW-BR subtracted cDNA pool, in contrast
with the BR-BW one. It seems that the subtraction was successful in the BW-BR library whereas this transcript could
not be successfully subtracted in the BR-BW library after
SSH procedure.
Relative expression levels of some target genes over the
three types of tissues
We used quantitative PCR on some transcripts to further
assess tissue specificity and gain data on the relative level
of expression in each tissue starting from total cDNA. For

all studied transcripts, PCR were performed from different
initial amount of total cDNA in order to construct standard curves. The equations of the curves are reported in
Table 6. All PCR efficiencies (E in Table 6), calculated
based on the slopes of the curves, varied between 92 and
107%. For the dilution range we chose, we could only
amplify the Major Vault Protein (MVP) transcript in the
branchial plume and the body wall tissues, the chitinase
precursor (ChPr) in the branchial plume tissue, and the
myohemerythrin (MH), T-cell receptor (TCR) and contig
27 from TR-BW library (TRbwC27, unknown protein)
transcripts in the trophosome tissue.
Relative expression levels were calculated between the different tissues of a whole organism after normalization of
the transcripts amplifications with the 18S reference gene.
The results from the analysis of several individuals are
shown in Fig. 3. The 16S ribosomal gene has 7.5-fold and
10-fold higher expression levels in the branchial plume
compared to the trophosome and the body wall, respectively. The ccox I and ATP synthase F1 transcripts were
equally present in the branchial plume and trophosome
tissues but comparatively less abundant in the body wall
tissue (about 16-fold and 43-fold, respectively). The new
CA sequence (RpCAbr) is preferentially expressed in the
branchial plume tissue compared to the trophosome
(1,000-fold less expression) and the body wall (109-fold
less expression) tissues. On the opposite, the RpCAtr transcript was more abundant in the trophosome tissue than
in the branchial plume (12-fold less expression) and the
body wall (2,500-fold less expression) tissues. Relative
quantification analyses also showed that cathepsine L-like

genes are also up-regulated in the branchial plume tissue
compared to the trophosome (about 4-fold less
expressed) and the body wall (about 7-fold less
expressed) tissues of the worm. The MVP transcript was
nearly 10-fold more abundant in the branchial plume
than in the body wall tissue but we could not detect it in
the trophosome tissue total cDNA.
Relative expression calculations for ChPr, MH, TCR and
TRbwC27 sequences could not be made because we could
only generate standard curves from the branchial plume
total cDNA (for ChPr transcript) or from the trophosome
total cDNA (for MH, TCR and TRbwC27) which indicate
that these transcripts are tissue-specific.

Discussion
Use of the SSH method for the study of symbiosis
We used SSH on different tissues from a single individual
to look for genes involved in the functioning of the symbiosis because it is not possible to obtain aposymbiotic
adult Riftia pachyptila. The body wall was used as a reference tissue to find specific proteins expressed in the gills
(main metabolite exchange organ with the milieu) and in
the trophosome (organ that houses the symbiotic bacteria). We then focused our attention on some chosen transcripts for a quantitative analysis. The remaining
unidentified sequences (many of which could correspond
to 3'UTR portions of cDNA) could prove interesting. Their
future identification will require either a RACE approach
or hybridization on a full length cDNA library.

Efficiency of the SSH method
All the 10 sequences that were more closely studied by
quantitative PCR showed differential expression in agreement with the subtractive libraries where they were found.
A transcript obtained in a given library showed the highest
expression in the expected tissue, as evidenced by checking the result with rapid PCR validation (Fig. 2) and from
several individuals by quantitative PCR (Fig. 3). In addition, although constitutively expressed in all cells of all tissues, only one tubulin transcript sequence was obtained
from the BR-BW library, and one actin sequence from the
BW-TR library. This demonstrates the adequate subtraction of these common sequences. However, some
sequences are sometimes highly represented, possibly
indicating a subtraction that was not as efficient. ccox I,
for example, could not be eliminated in the BR-BW cDNA
pool, but this may be due to the fact that it was more
expressed in the branchial plume than in the body wall
tissue. Strangely however, we recovered the RpCAbr transcript from the BW-BR library (Table 3) although it was
109-fold less abundant in the body wall than in the
branchial plume tissues (Fig. 3).

As noticed by Ji and coworkers [23], SSH PCR favors
highly differentially expressed genes. From our quantitative PCR results, some transcripts showed such high differential expression (e.g. RpCAbr in the branchial plume
compared to the other tissues, and RpCAtr in the trophosome compared to the other tissues). These authors suggest that the primary application of SSH PCR should be
the detection of dramatic alteration of gene expression, as
it is for example the case for gene expression profiling of
two different tissues. Our use of SSH for comparing pairs
of tissues seems very appropriate.

Proteins degradation and turnover in the branchial plume
tissue
Some transcripts were preferentially expressed in the
branchial plume tissue. Relative quantification of the
cathepsin transcript (a degradation enzyme found in lysosomes) revealed a more important expression in the
branchial plume tissue, compared to the body wall (protected by the tube) and the trophosome. The plume is the
only organ in direct contact with sea-water, and thereby
strongly exposed to hydrogen sulfide and other toxic molecules such as heavy metals which are abundant in the
hydrothermal
vent
environment.
Electron-dense
organelles (EDO) seem to be very common in tissues of
sulfide-adapted marine annelids. Such structures have
previously been observed in both the Riftia pachyptila epidermal body wall [24] and the branchial plume organ
(Ann Andersen, personal communication). Arp and coworkers [25] hypothesized that EDO structures could actually be secondary lysosomes. This could be in agreement
with our results of cathepsin expression, found to be highest in this highly exposed tissue. Julian and coworkers [26]
showed that even in sulfide-tolerant organisms like the
annelid Glycera dibranchiata, sulfide exposure poisons the
mitochondria, leading to depolarization that is not reversible. Lysosomes could degrade mitochondria that have
been damaged by sulfide exposure. Besides, we also found
a Rab5 GDP/GTP exchange factor (BRbwC22), which is a
member of the Ras superfamily of GTPases. This protein,
involved in vesicle trafficking, is known to be located in
early endosomes that precede the formation of lysosomes.

Interestingly, another pathway of degradation could also
be involved since we obtained a Valosin-Containing Protein (VCP, BRbwC21), which is required in ubiquitin-pro-

higher expression: the branchial plume was the calibrator for ribosomal RNA 16S, ccox I, Cathepsin, RpCAbr and MVP amplifications, the trophosome was the calibrator for RpCAtr and ATPF1 amplifications. The number of tissue replicates (n) ranges
from 3 to 4, and corresponds to the number of intra-individual tissue pairs we had.
teasome degradation [27]. The existence of two VCP
transcripts has recently been demonstrated in an annelid,
the earthworm Eisenia fetida [28]. Our sequence shows the
best homology scores with the predicted VCP protein
sequence of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus [Expect = 0.014]
and the eVCP-1 isoform from Eisenia fetida [Expect =
0.025] which is ubiquitously expressed in this worm [28].
If EDOs do represent autophagic degradation of
organelles as suggested by Arp and coworkers [25], rapid
replacement of organelles should take place [29]. The
high expression level of ribosomal 16S, an essential gene
for the translation of mitochondrial messenger RNAs into
proteins, and the presence of some transcripts linked to
transcription (BRbwC19 and 20, Table 2) is then consistent with a high protein turnover in this tissue.
Sulfide oxidation with the concomitant production of
ATP by the mitochondria of the annelid Arenicola marina
has been shown [30]. However, no protein sequence was

found here that would suggest a similar property of R.
pachyptila mitochondria.
Hydroxylamine reductase protein
Formerly known as prismane, the hydroxylamine reductase is a member of the Hybrid-Cluster Protein (HCP) family and is thought to play a role in nitrogen metabolism.
It catalyses the reduction of hydroxylamine to form
ammonia using NADH. In rat liver mitochondria, this
enzyme is firmly attached to the mitochondrial membrane [31] and its activity can prevent hydroxylamine to
inhibit mitochondrial respiration [32]. However, blasts of
our sequence did not match with the few eukaryotic
sequences available but resulted in 100 bacteria sequences
hits. The best ones are those of the Actinobacteria Salinispora arenicola [Expect = 5e-19] and the α-proteobacteria
Rhodospirillum rubrum [Expect = 5e-19]. Because this
sequence did not match any sequence in the Riftia symbiont genomic database, it could be contamination from
bacteria living close to the branchial plume of the worm.

Major Vault Protein gene expression
The Major Vault Protein (MVP) (100 kDa) is the major
protein component of vaults, ribonucleic particles of
13MDa. Some studies established that vaults could be
involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport of ribosomes
and/or mRNA [33]. This could be coherent with our
results of 16S expression obtained on the branchial plume
tissue in which probable high transcription levels of this
protein occur. Other studies indicate the participation of
MVP in drug resistance mechanisms where it could act as
a nucleocytoplasmic and vesicular transporter of drugs
and/or metabolites to transport them to exocytotic vesicles or proton pumps [34,35]. It could be evidenced that
MVP gene in Mytilus edulis was predominantly expressed
in epithelia-rich tissues such as the gills and digestive
gland and could be involved in multixenobiotic resistance
[36]. In our study, MVP transcript is preferentially
expressed in the branchial plume tissue compared to the
body wall, while no MVP transcript was detected in the
trophosome samples. The presence of such a protein in
the branchial plume tissue may be used to temporarily
immobilize toxic molecules before they are processed.
Chitinase gene expression
Interestingly, a chitinase precursor was recovered as a
branchial plume specific transcript. A previous report
indicated chitinase activity in the opisthosome and
branchial plume of R. pachyptila [37]. Chitin is a major
component of the tube of R. pachyptila, produced by specialized glands located in the body wall and the vestimentum [38]. Chitinase activity was suggested to be involved
in tube growth and tube shape modifications [37]. A chitinase sequence was recently discovered in the hydroid
cnidarian Hydractinia [39] and a possible role of chitinase
enzyme in pattern formation and allorecognition was suggested. Interestingly, the transcript was exclusively
expressed in ectodermal tissues of the animal, and the
authors also suggested a possible role in host defense
against pathogens. Such a hypothesis could be interesting
to explore given our quantitative PCR experiments
because we only could amplify this transcript from cDNA
from the branchial plume, the only organ in contact with
the environmental sea water.
Tissue-specific expression of different carbonic anhydrases
Our quantification analyses showed a higher abundance
of the RpCAbr transcript in the branchial plume compared to the trophosome (present at very low levels) and
the body wall tissues. In contrast, the RpCAtr transcript
was very abundant in the trophosome compared to the
branchial plume (medium levels) and the body wall tissues. Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization confirmed the coexpression of the two transcripts in the branchial plume in
contrast with the trophosome where only one transcript
could be detected [19]. An alignment of these translated

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/337

CA cDNAs with vertebrate and non-vertebrate CA protein
sequences revealed the conservation of most amino acids
involved in the catalytic site, indicating that the two proteins are probably functional if the cDNAs are translated
[19].
Myohemerythrin, T-cell receptor, and unidentified
transcripts from the trophosome library
A complete coding sequence obtained from the TR-BW
library (contig 17, Table 4) showed a very high homology
score with a myohemerythrin sequence from the Sipuncula Sipunculus nudus [GenBank:CAG14944] (Expect = 1e11). The complete Riftia sequence has an open-reading
frame of 120 amino acids. Myohemerythrin is an oxygenbinding protein that participates in the storage of oxygen
in muscles. Such a protein could be involved in the regulation of cadmium levels in the gut of the annelid Nereis
diversicolor [40]. In Hirudo medicinalis, it would have indirect antibacterial properties by regulating free iron availability to deprive bacteria of iron essential for their growth
[41].

Both TCR and TRbwC27 cDNAs showed specific expression in the trophosome tissue where they could be essential. The TCR transcript first caught our attention because
it matched a sequence fragment coding for a T-cell receptor, which is a complex of integral membrane proteins
that participates in the activation of T-cells in response to
the presentation of an antigen. The trophosome is mostly
composed of bacteriocytes which house bacterial cells in
intracellular vacuoles and cellular recognition may be very
important for the functioning of this tissue. As for the
TRbwC27 it is a large fragment of 273 nucleotides which
is highly represented in our subtracted library but did not
reveal reliable Blastx homology E-values.

Methods
Animals and sampling
Specimens of Riftia pachyptila were collected at the Oasis
site (17°25.385 S, 113°12.280 W) at 2600 meters-depth
along the South East Pacific Rise during the BIOSPEEDO
2004 cruise. For each individual, parts of the branchial
plume, trophosome and body wall tissues were isolated
on ice, placed in RNAlater (Ambion) for 24 h at 4°C and
then frozen in liquid nitrogen.
RNA extraction
Plume, trophosome and body wall tissue samples were
ground individually in liquid nitrogen under RNase-free
conditions. For each tissue, total RNA was extracted using
the RNAble buffer (Eurobio) following the manufacturer's instructions. Then, both for library constructions
and for complete sequencing, messenger poly-A RNAs
were purified using the oligo-dT resin column of the
mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham).

Construction of subtractive tissue-specific cDNA libraries
Libraries were constructed from tissues taken from a single
individual, thereby representing a single organism's transcriptome. A total of 4 libraries were produced: branchial
plume vs. body wall subtracted library (and its reciprocal)
and trophosome vs. body wall subtracted library (and its
reciprocal). For all tissue pairs, cDNA synthesis as well as
subtractive suppressive hybridization (SSH, [[42], [43]])
including steps of adaptor ligation, subtractive hybridization, and selective amplification were performed following the protocol of the Clontech PCR-Select™ cDNA
Subtraction Kit (BD Biosciences).

In the BR-BW library, SSH was performed to produce a
cDNA library enriched in branchial plume specific transcripts. The tester sample was the cDNA population from
the branchial filaments (BR) and the driver sample was
the cDNA population from the body wall tissue (BW). In
the BW/BR library the tester and driver samples were
reversed, and SSH was performed to produce a cDNA
library enriched in body wall specific transcripts. In the
TR-BW library, the tester sample was the cDNA population from the trophosome (TR) and the driver sample was
the cDNA population from the body wall tissue (BW). In
the BW-TR library, the tester and driver samples were
reversed.
Cloning and sequencing
For each SSH procedure, the whole amplification product
was cloned into the TOPO®-TA cloning vector (Invitrogen), producing a range of cDNA fragment sizes. Nearly
200 cDNA fragments were sequenced for each library.
Plasmid DNA from individual colonies were purified with
the FlexiPrep kit (Amersham) and used in a dye-primer
cycle sequencing reaction with T3 or T7 universal primers
and the Big Dye® Terminator V3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit
(Applied Biosystems). Reactions were then run on a 16capillary 3130 Applied Biosystems sequencer.
Sequence analysis and homology search
Most of chromatograms obtained after sequencing were
treated with PHRED [ [44]] and Seqclean software (TGIR,
the Institute for Genomic Research, Rockville, MD, USA)
to remove vector and adaptors sequences. Progressively,
additional sequences were treated manually. Clustering
was performed with the TGICL programs, Megablast and
CAP3 [[45]]. Clusters and contigs were formed on the
whole set of sequences and also individually for each of
the four libraries. Contigs were then verified manually to
detect possible chimeras. BLAST analyses of the cDNA
libraries sequences were performed on the NCBI server.
The assembled sequences were analyzed for homology
with known sequences in databases using the BlastX and
BlastN programs [[46]] and also treated with the PhyloGena software [[47]] which combines both homology

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/337

searching and phylogenetic reconstruction to verify the
homology attributions.
The redundancy corresponds to the probability that a
newly sequenced cDNA was previously obtained. Redundancy rate was calculated with the formula:
R = (1- (Nu/Nt)) × 100, where Nu is the number of unique
sequences and Nt is the total number of sequences.
Validation of differential expression by simple PCR
Unsubtracted and subtracted PCR samples (respectively
before and after SSH procedure) were obtained as recommended in the Clontech PCR-Select™ cDNA Subtraction
Kit (BD Biosciences). These samples were then diluted
ten-fold in sterile milliQ water. For each transcript tested,
PCRs were conducted on these diluted unsubtracted and
subtracted samples with specific forward and reverse
primers (Table 7). Each reaction mixture was composed of
1 µl of cDNA sample; 1.2 µl of specific forward primer (10
µM), 1.2 µl of specific reverse primer (10 µM), 22.4 µl of
sterile water, 3 µl of 10X PCR reaction buffer, 0.6 µl of
dNTP Mix (10 mM) and 0.6 µl of 50X Advantage cDNA
Polymerase Mix (BD Biosciences). The following thermal
cycling program was used for 33 cycles: 94°C for 30 s,
60°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 2 min. For each cDNA pool
tested, a 5 µl-aliquot was removed from the reaction mixture every 5 cycles, starting at the end of cycle 18.
SYBR Green quantitative PCR
Reverse transcription (RT)
Fresh RT reaction was carried out with a random primer
on each total RNA sample (branchial plume, trophosome
and body wall). The reaction mixture was composed of 2
µl of M-MLV 5X RT buffer; 0.5 µl of BSA (10 mg/ml), 1 µl
of total RNA (1.24 µg/µl), 2.5 µl of dNTP (4 mM total),
1.5 µl of Random Primer 9 (Ozyme) (100 ng/µl), 3 µl
DEPC water. The reaction mixtures were then incubated at
80°C for 5 minutes and placed on ice. M-MLV RT was
added (1 µl) to each reaction mixture and all reactions
were incubated at 42°C for 1 hour and finally placed on
ice.
Amplification
Specific pairs of primers for some target genes (Table 7)
were designed using the software Primer Express. 18S
rRNA transcript was chosen as a reference gene for the normalization of expression data and was amplified with the
18h and 18L primers designed by Halanych and coworkers [ [48]]. For amplifications, the Power SYBR Green PCR
master mix (PE Applied Biosystems) was used in 23 µl
reaction mixtures on a Chromo4™ System CFB-3240
(BIORAD). Amplification conditions were 40 cycles with
the following profile: 95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and
72°C for 1 min.

Standard curves
In order to estimate the relative expression levels of each
transcript by the 2-∆∆Ct method, we calculated PCR efficiencies of the transcripts amplifications to verify they do
not highly differ from the reference transcript (rRNA 18S)
amplification. PCR were performed from a dilution range
of total cDNA from each tissue (from one sample). Therefore, we performed PCR starting from total cDNA

amounts ranging from 6.2 pg to 620 ng. Each PCR reaction was performed in triplicate. For each initial template
quantity, we looked at the threshold cycle, the Ct, corresponding to the number of cycles required to reach a set
quantity of amplified cDNA during the exponential
phase. The standard curves were generated by plotting the
log of the initial template concentration against the Ct
generated for each dilution.

Data analysis
For each transcript, the efficiency (E) was calculated from
the slope (S) of the standard curve using the formula:

E = 10-1/S - 1

Once differences between efficiencies of reference gene
and target gene amplifications were approximately equal,
we calculated the relative expression level for each gene
analyzed. In each tissue, amplification of the target transcript was compared to the endogenous control amplification in order to get the normalized number of cycles
(NNC):

7.

NNC = Ct target - Ct 18S
8.

Then, for relative quantification measurement, we used
the 2-∆∆Ct method [ [49]] for individuals for which we had
analyzed at least one pair of tissues. Relative quantification results were obtained by comparing levels of expression with the calibrator tissue, the latter being chosen as
the tissue for which the better expression was observed
with the following calculation:
Relative expression level = 2-(NNCsample-NNCcalibrator).
