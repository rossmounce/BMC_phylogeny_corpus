Abstract
Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs), present in most metazoans, are small non-coding RNAs that
control gene expression by negatively regulating translation through binding to the 3'UTR of
mRNA transcripts. Previously, experimental and computational methods were used to construct
miRNA gene repositories agreeing with careful submission guidelines.
Results: An algorithm we developed – miRNAminer – is used for homologous conserved miRNA
gene search in several animal species. Given a search query, candidate homologs from different
species are tested for their known miRNA properties, such as secondary structure, energy and
alignment and conservation, in order to asses their fidelity. When applying miRNAminer on seven
mammalian species we identified several hundreds of high-confidence homologous miRNAs
increasing the total collection of (miRbase) miRNAs, in these species, by more than 50%.
miRNAminer uses stringent criteria and exhibits high sensitivity and specificity.
Conclusion: We present – miRNAminer – the first web-server for homologous miRNA gene
search in animals. miRNAminer can be used to identify conserved homolog miRNA genes and can
also be used prior to depositing miRNAs in public databases. miRNAminer is available at http://
pag.csail.mit.edu/mirnaminer.

Background
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, ~22 nt non-coding RNAs
that control gene expression. miRNAs bind to the 3'UTRs
of their regulated mRNA transcripts to facilitate mRNA
degradation or translation inhibition [1,2]. miRNAs are
present in most metazoans and are thought to regulate a
diverse range of biological processes [3,4]. miRNA genes'
evolution is unique since they mostly emerge through
duplication events [5]; exhibit most often unidirectional
evolution [6]; are generally gained and not lost [7]; show
several cases of rapid evolution in primates [8,9]; are
rarely changed due to functional constraints [10]; and,
show relatively rare evolutionary acquisition events
(accounted by their relatively small numbers).

miRNA predictions based on computational methods,
which followed initial extensive cloning efforts, are based
on the secondary structure of the miRNA, its phylogenetic
conservation and thermodynamic stability [11,12].
miRNA gene repositories are constantly expanding giving
rise to more than 3500 reported miRNAs in more than 30
animal species (Sanger miRbase database, Version 10.0
[13,14]). However, it is apparent that even this comprehensive repository is far from completion, accounted by
the very few miRNAs listed for dog (6) and chimpanzee
(83), compared to human (533), to name two examples.
Since these differences cannot be accounted merely by
species-specific miRNAs, we saw the need for a computational tool for miRNA homologous searches.

Implementation

Results

We present miRNAminer, a tool for automatic identification of homolog miRNAs based on a given user defined
query miRNA. The tool exploits numerous characteristics
of miRNAs: high conservation of precursor sequences,
very high conservation of mature sequences (particularly
in the seed region, nt 2–8 [15]), and hairpin secondary
structure with high folding energy and base pairing. miRNAminer first uses BLAST [16] to select candidate matches
and ranks them according to their e-values. Then it
employs a series of rigorous filters to improve specificity.

We used miRNAminer to perform a comprehensive
homology search for miRNA precursors in seven species
(human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, dog, cow and opossum). For the search, we used all 2925 vertebrate miRNAs
listed in the Sanger miRNA registry (release 9.0 of October
2006). Table 1 shows the summary information of miRNAs listed in the Sanger registry and of new, or non-registered, miRNAs identified by our method. We identified
790 non-miRbase registered miRNAs with major contributions to chimp (P. troglodytes), dog (C. familiaris) and
cow (B. taurus), vastly increasing their known miRNA repertoire and possibly opening new research facets in these
species (see Additional file 1[20]). Table 2 presents the
miRNA candidates that our method identifies in human
(H. sapiens). It is of interest that 22 new candidate miRNAs
in human were identified, despite many previous exhaustive human miRNA identification studies [8,21], possibly
due to recent non-human/primate miRNAs identification
[22], updated assembly of the human genome (Ensembl
H. sapiens genome release 42 used here was updated in
October 2006), and the modification of search parameters as implemented in miRNAminer.

An input query consists of a precursor miRNA, mature
miRNA, a set of filter threshold values and the number of
best-fitted results requested in the output. We designed
miRNAminer's algorithm to maximize specificity of
matches. This is because the designed application of miRNAminer is to identify homolog matches after a miRNA
has been experimentally confirmed. We estimated the
default values presented below so that each filter by itself
selects 95% of known miRNAs in training genomes (criteria was also based on [17]).
miRNAminer's algorithm follows these steps: (i) Use
BLAST [16] to find matches in target genomes (the whole
precursor miRNA from the query is used); (ii) Filter with
e-value threshold (default 0.05 per chromosome); (iii)
Extend the match by adding flanking nucleotides (default
50) up- and down-stream from the match (Ensembl
genome database; [18]). Examine all possible extensions
of the match within threshold length (default min 70 nt,
max 180 nt); (iv) Filter with RNA secondary folding
energy threshold (default -25 kcal/mole; RNAfold with
options "-p -d2 -noLP" [19]); (v) Filter with minimal
base-pairing threshold (default 55% pairing; with 20 gap
penalty and 0.5 extension penalty); (vi) Filter with
requirement for hairpin-shape secondary structure; (vii)
Filter with alignment of precursor sequences (default 56%
identity); (viii) Filter with alignment of mature miRNA
sequences (default 80% identity); (ix) Filter with maximum number of mismatches in mature miRNA sequences
(default 3 nt); (x) Filter with conservation of seed (2–8 nt,
required 100% conservation [15]); (xi) Filter with position of mature miRNA on the hairpin (max 4 nt overlap
of mature sequence and hairpin loop). miRNAminer's
output includes detailed analysis of the identified
genomic region(s) that passed the selected threshold criteria (Figure 1). Currently, miRNAminer supports
searches in 10 metazoan genomes. We will regularly add
additional genomes upon their release. After the query is
issued, results are usually available within a minute
(though this depends on the number of results requested)
and can either be viewed on the screen or requested to be
sent by email.

We compared our predicted miRNAs (in the human species; Table 2) to other prediction methods. We found that
18 and 36% of our miRNAs are contained within RNAmicro [23,5] and Berezikov 2005 [24] databases, respectively, out of almost 3000 and 1000 miRNAs in each set,
respectively. The overlap is not extensive however even
when miRNAs derived from algorithms using very similar
search parameters are compared only about 50% overlap
is seen [25]. One of our identified miRNAs, which is not
reported by any other study, was recently identified experimentally ([26] present in miRbase version 10.0 and not
9.0) increasing confidence in our unique miRNAs. Notably, even though miRNAs from all species were used to
search for human homologs, the candidate miRNAs discovered are homologs to genes in two species only, M.
musculus and R. norvegicus, indicating better miRbase
coverage for mouse and rat than for other species. Two
examples of the non-registered human homolog miRNA
genes are presented in Figure 2. miRbase mouse miR-764
sequence, which has no known registered homologs was
used as input for miRNAminer search (with default
parameters). The output reported a homolog (presumably
hsa-miR-764; see Table 2), which is located in the second
intron of Human serotonin receptor 2C (HTR2C; NM
000868; Figure 2A). The mouse miRNA homolog is
located in an intron of the same gene (HTR2C; NM
008312) suggesting an evolutionary conserved co-expression of miRNA and its host gene [27-29]. Second in the
list of non-registered human homolog miRNA genes
(sorted according to BLAST e-values) is miR-763. This
miRNA spans the longest complementary sequence out of

the list, has the lowest RNA folding energy (Table 2) and
shows high conservation between many species (Figure
2C). Interestingly, human miR-763 is harboured in an
intron of the high mobility group AT-hook 2 oncogene
(HMGA2; for review see [30,31]). Recent disrupted interplay between miRNAs and HMGA2 showed an increase in
oncogenesis [32-34]. To regulate their targets, miRNAs
bind to 'seed' regions in the 3'UTR, typically 6–7 nt long
(nt 2 to nt 7 or 8 of the miRNA [15,35,36]; also see [37]).
miR-763, possibly also co-expressed with its host gene
[27-29], has a conserved binding site for its own harboured miRNA (nt 2 to 8 of the miRNA binds position
2192 in the 3'UTR which is conserved in human/mouse/
rat). It is tempting to speculate a negative feedback regulatory role of newly identified human miR-763 and its
oncogenic host when co-expressed in the same spatiotemporal context. To this end data from Expressed

The results are sorted according to e-values (based on BLAST search; [16]). Lengths refer to lengths of miRNA precursors. For each result, the
table shows position, RNA fold quality and the identity ratio of the discovered miRNA candidates to the homolog in the original species. The
existence of two occurrences for miR-322 and miR-543 (italicized) indicates that two origins (mouse and rat) of the same miRNA were found in
Homo sapiens.

Sequence Tags (ESTs) supports this possibility (Figure
2C). Other identified miRNAs presented in Table 2 show
high species conservation (for example, miR-670) or are
located in exons (for example, miR-711) or exon-intron
junctions (for example, miR-762). Interestingly, in a
recent study involving deep sequencing, four of our
human predicted miRNAs were confirmed (miR-760,
708, 543, and 665 [38], available in miRbase version
10.0). To conclusively confirm the presence of the identified candidates in the studied species, an experimental
verification is required. However, the candidates identified by our method are close homologs to known miRNAs
and as such are not required to meet as stringent criteria
to be annotated as novel miRNAs [17]. In this study we
looked at homolog genes which are genes related to each
other by descent from a common ancestral DNA
sequence. We do not segregate between orthologs, genes
in different species that evolved from a common ancestral
gene by speciation, and paralogs, genes separated by the
event of genetic duplication. We cannot also rule out that
similar miRNAs in different species have developed independently [39]. Our tool, which is based on evolutionary
conservation, can only detect evolutionarily conserved
miRNA genes. We are currently improving our algorithm

to include multiple alignments of vertebrate miRNA
sequences in order to better refine the boundaries of the
miRNA precursor sequence.
For searches with relaxed parameters (reduced stringency)
we suggest initially performing the following modifications: (i) do not 'Require seed conservation in mature
miRNA (nt 2–8)' (uncheck box); (ii) increase 'maximal
number of gaps in miRNA precursor alignment' from 10
(default) to 15; (iii) decrease 'minimal mature miRNA
identity' from 0.8 (default) to 0.7; (iv) decrease 'minimal
base pairing percentage in miRNA precursor' from 55
(default) to 40; and (v) change 'minimal/maximal length
of precursor sequence (nt)' from 70/180 (default) to 50/
250. In order to view miRNAs which are other than the
top candidate we suggest increasing the 'number of results
to report' from 1 (default) to 5. The parameters (i–v)
above are listed in the order that would output an increasing total number of identified miRNAs. For example,
reducing mature miRNA identity from 0.8 (default) to 0.7
increases miRNAs from 22 to 24 (9%) and 31 to 36 (16%)
in human and mouse, respectively. On the other hand, we
found that changing the length of the miRNA precursor
from 70–180 nt (default) to 50–250 nt, added only 1

Two examples of a non-miRbase registered miRNA identified using our miRNAminer web-server. (A) Human
miR-764 was identified using miRbase mouse miR-764 sequence as input (and default parameters) for miRNAminer search. The
output reported a homolog (presumably hsa-miR-764), which is located in the second intron of human serotonin receptor 2C
(HTR2C; NM 000868). The mouse miRNA homolog is located in an intron of the same gene (HTR2C; NM 008312) suggesting
an evolutionary conserved co-expression of miRNA and its host gene [27-29]. High conservation is seen in this region (mountain-like graph derived from UCSC Genome Browser 17 species multiZ alignment; [43]). Black rectangles represent exons
(shorter rectangles in C are UTRs), lines are introns and dark-grey rectangles are miRNA genes. (B) RNA secondary structure
of both the identified human (top) and mouse (bottom) miR-764 exhibit similar thermodynamic stability (41.8/49.9 kcal/mol,
respectively) and structures (mature miRNA region is underlined). Human miR-764 homolog was also identified by Berezikov
[21]. (C) Non-registered (miRbase) human miR-763 is highly conserved among vertebrate species and can potentially bind its
own host gene. On top; a schematic non-scaled representation of the HMGA2 transcript (NM 003483; human miR-763 is in

however, might change when run in combination with
other modified parameters. Altogether each of the modified parameters listed above will result, independently, in
an average miRNA increase of 11% when tested on seven
mammalian species.

We estimated miRNAminer's sensitivity (Table 3) and
specificity. The sensitivity, on seven mammalian species,
is 0.88. Sensitivity for a species is the portion of the species' miRNAs with known homologs that are detected by
miRNAminer using miRNAs from all other species. We
used only miRNAs which miRbase lists for more than one
species. Sensitivity measures are higher in chimp (0.94),
mouse (0.88) and rat (0.91) than in human (0.85). To

miRNA homologs in C. elegans, which has a large evolutionary distance from the studied mammals. We treated as
false positives all hits reported by miRNAminer that were
not identified as homologs by previous studies. This conservative treatment may over-approximate the number of
false positives. Using 1375 miRNAs from the seven studied mammalian species, miRNAminer detected, in C. elegans, two known homologs (let-7 and mir-124) and
reported only five false positives.

Conclusion
Several approaches to identify miRNA homologs have
been previously described, both in plants [40], and in animals [5,41,42]. However, the only tool that is available as
a web service, microHARVESTER [40], is targeted for
plants. miRNAminer is the first available miRNA gene
homolog search tool for animal genomes.
