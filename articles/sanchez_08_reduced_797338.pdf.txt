Abstract
Background: Coeliac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathology triggered by the ingestion
of cereal gluten proteins. This disorder is associated with imbalances in the composition of the gut
microbiota that could be involved in its pathogenesis. The aim of the present study was to
determine whether intestinal Enterobacteriaceae populations of active and non-active coeliac
patients and healthy children differ in diversity and virulence-gene carriage, so as to establish a
possible link between the pathogenic potential of enterobacteria and the disease.
Methods: Enterobacteriaceae clones were isolated on VRBD agar from faecal samples of 31
subjects (10 active coeliac patients, 10 symptom-free coeliac patients and 11 healthy controls) and
identified at species level by the API 20E system. Escherichia coli clones were classified into four
phylogenetic groups A, B1, B2 and D and the prevalence of eight virulence-associated genes (type1 fimbriae [fimA], P fimbriae [papC], S fimbriae [sfaD/E], Dr haemagglutinin [draA], haemolysin [hlyA],
capsule K1 [neuB], capsule K5 [KfiC] and aerobactin [iutA]) was determined by multiplex PCR.
Results: A total of 155 Enterobacteriaceae clones were isolated. Non-E. coli clones were more
commonly isolated in healthy children than in coeliac patients. The four phylogenetic E. coli groups
were equally distributed in healthy children, while in both coeliac patients most commensal isolates
belonged to group A. Within the virulent groups, B2 was the most prevalent in active coeliac
disease children, while D was the most prevalent in non-active coeliac patients. E coli clones of the
virulent phylogenetic groups (B2+D) from active and non-active coeliac patients carried a higher
number of virulence genes than those from healthy individuals. Prevalence of P fimbriae (papC),
capsule K5 (sfaD/E) and haemolysin (hlyA) genes was higher in E. coli isolated from active and nonactive coeliac children than in those from control subjects.
Conclusion: This study has demonstrated that virulence features of the enteric microbiota are
linked to coeliac disease.

Background
The human gastrointestinal tract is a complex ecosystem
integrated by up to 1014 bacteria. These microorganisms
may belong to more than 500 different bacterial species,
although 99% of the total community consists of only
30–40 species. The intestinal microbiota plays an important role in human health as they contribute to inhibiting
pathogen colonization, boosting the immune system, and
metabolising nutrients [1-3]. Alterations in the intestinal
microbiota have also been linked to inflammatory bowel
diseases (IBD), such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, as well as to other immune-related disorders. IBD
patients have been shown to carry higher concentrations
of mucosa-associated bacteria than control groups. In
addition, the gut microbiota of these patients was characterized by a decrease in protective bacteria, such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, and an increase in harmful
bacterial groups like Bacteroides and Escherichia coli. This
phenomenon has been named "dysbiosis" [4,5].
Escherichia coli was the first bacterial specie to be identified
in human gastrointestinal samples. This widespread commensal Gram-negative bacterium found in the intestinal
tract of healthy individuals can occasionally cause intestinal and extraintestinal diseases. The pathogenic potential
of E. coli stains could be influenced by host endogenous
factors, as well as by the genetic structure and ecological
distribution of the strains in a particular host. Human
infections by E. coli strains commonly occur in immunocompromised individuals or when the normal gastrointestinal barrier is broken [6], enabling opportunistic pathogens to evade host surveillance mechanisms.
Phylogenetic studies based on the analysis of 38 metabolic enzymes, have shown that E. coli strains fall into four
main phylogenetic groups, denominated "A", "B1", "B2"
and "D" [7]. Strains causing extra-intestinal infections
mainly belong to group B2, and to a lesser extent to group
D, whereas commensal E. coli strains mostly belong to A
and B1 groups [8]. E. coli strains belonging to B2 and D
groups carry more virulence-associated genes than strains
from A and B1 groups [9,10]. Therefore, the presence or
absence of certain E. coli strains or an altered distribution
of their relative abundance can enhance the pathogenic
potential of the enteric population in predisposed individuals.
Coeliac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathology
triggered by the ingestion of wheat-gluten and similar proteins of rye, barley and, probably, oats. Coeliac disease
can be present at any age with a variety of clinical features;
however, typical cases manifest in early childhood with
gastrointestinal symptoms [11]. In coeliac patients, the
inflammatory milieu caused by gluten antigens could lead
to imbalances in gut microbial composition, characterised by higher numbers of Gram-negative bacteria and
decreased numbers of beneficial Gram-positive bacteria,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/8/50

as compared to healthy individuals. In previous studies, E.
coli proportions were significantly higher in duodenal
biopsies of active coeliac patients than in controls [12];
moreover, a similar trend was detected in faeces although
the differences were not so remarkable [13]. However, little is known about the possible association between
enterobacterial population and coeliac disease pathogenesis.
The aim of the present study was to determine whether
intestinal Enterobacteriaceae populations of active and
non-active coeliac patients and healthy children differ in
diversity and virulence-gene carriage, so as to establish a
possible link between the pathogenic potential of enterobacteria and the disease.

Methods
Subjects and sampling
Thirty-one children were included in this study, 10 active
coeliac patients, on a normal gluten-containing diet,
showing clinical symptoms of the disease, positive coeliac
serology markers and signs of severe enteropathy by duodenal biopsy examination (mean age 3.86 years, range
1.0–8.86 years); 10 symptom-free coeliac patients (nonactive coeliac), who had been on a gluten-free diet for 1–
2 years (mean age 6.2 years, range 1.0–12.0 years); and 11
healthy children without known food intolerance (mean
age 3.51 years, range 0.1–7.75 years). None of the children included in the study had been treated with antibiotics for at least 1 month before the sampling time. Faecal
samples were collected and immediately stored at 4°C,
under anaerobic conditions (AnaeroGen, Oxoid, Hampshire, UK), and analysed in less than 12 hours. The study
protocol was approved by the local Ethics Committee,
and children were enrolled in the study after written
informed consent was obtained from their parents.
Isolation and identification of Enterobacteriaceae clones
from faeces
Faecal samples (2 g wet weight) were 10-fold diluted in
phospahate-buffered saline (PBS, 130 mM sodium chloride, 10 mM sodium phosphate, [pH 7.2]), and homogenized in a Lab Blender 400 Stomacher (Seward Medical,
London, UK). Serial dilutions were made in PBS and aliquots were plated on Violet Red Bile Dextrose Agar, VRBD
(Scharlau, Barcelona, Spain) and incubated under aerobic
conditions at 37°C for 48 hours. Then, five individual
Enterobacteriaceae-like colonies differing in size, shape,
colour or mucoid appearance on VRBD agar were isolated
and subcultured in Plate Count Agar (Scharlau, Barcelona,
Spain) under aerobic conditions at 37°C for 24 hours.
The identity of the presumptive Enterobacteriaceae isolates
was confirmed by conventional microbiological methods,
including colony and cellular morphology and Gram
staining. The selected isolates were further identified at
species level by using the API20E system (BioMerieux,
Page 2 of 7

BMC Gastroenterology 2008, 8:50

Lyon, France), in order to select E. coli clones and non-E.
coli clones.
Phylogenetic classification and virulence-associated gene
carriage of E. coli isolates
Escherichia coli isolates were assigned to one of the four
phylogenetic groups A, B1, B2 or D by a triplex PCR technique as previously described [14]. The 25 μl PCR mixture
consisted of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1
μM of each primer pair for the genes ChuA, YjaA and
TspE4C2, 200 μM, dNTPs and 2.5 U of Taq polymerase
(Ecotaq, ECOGEN, Spain). A piece of a bacterial colony
was collected directly from a plate and added to the reaction mixture as a source of DNA. The PCR programme was
as follows: initial denaturalization at 94°C for 4 min; and
30 cycles of 5 s at 94°C, 10 s at 59°C; and a final extension
step of 5 min at 72°C. The PCR products were separated
in a 2% agarose gel electrophoresis and visualised by
ethidium-bromide staining. The isolates were assigned to
phylogenetic groups as follows: ChuA+ YjaA+, group B2;
ChuA+YjaA-, group D; ChuA- TspE4C2+ group B1; ChuATspE4C2- group A.

The same isolates were also characterized by two sets of
multiplex PCR as described by Nowrouzian et al. (2001)
[15]. The first PCR detected the presence of the following
virulence-associated genes: fimA (type-1 fimbriae), papC
(P fimbriae), sfaD/E (S fimbriae) and draA (Dr haemagglutinin). The second PCR detected the presence of the
following genes: hlyA (haemolysin), neuB (capsule K1),
KfiC (capsule K5) and iutA (aerobactin). The 25 μl PCR
reaction mixture consisted of 10 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.3),
1.5 mM of MgCl2 for the first multiplex PCR and 2.0 mM
MgCl2 for the second multiplex PCR, 0.45 μM of each
primer, 100 μM dNTPs and 2.5 U of Taq polymerase (Ecotaq, ECOGEN, Spain). A piece of a bacterial colony was
used as a source of DNA as indicated above.
Statistical analyses
Differences in prevalence of different species, phylogenetic groups or virulence genes were established by applying the chi-square test, and when appropriate by the twotailed Fisher's exact test and Kolmogorov-Smirnof test. In
each case, analyses were carried out with the Statgraphics
software (Manugistics, Rockville, MD), and statistical differences were established at P value below 0.05.

Results
Diversity of Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli clones from
coeliac and healthy children
Of the 31 individuals analyzed in this study, only 14
(45%) carried Enterobacteriaceae species other than E. coli.
The latter species was always recovered in healthy individuals and in eight of them (73%) at least one other non-E.
coli species was detected. Non-E. coli species were detected
in only four (40%) active and two non-active coeliac

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/8/50

patients (20%). Non-E. coli clones were recovered more
abundantly in healthy children than in non-active coeliac
patients (P = 0.03).
Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Klebsiella oxytoca and Escherichia vulneris were identified in healthy children harbouring non-E. coli species. Klyuvera spp,
Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Shigella spp, Chryseomonas luteola and Klebsiella oxytoca were also isolated in
active coeliac disease children and Klebsiella oxytoca,
Aeromonas hydrophila/caviae and Klebsiella pneumoniae were
identified in non-active coeliac patients.
Phylogenetic classification of E. coli clones from coeliac
and healthy children
The phylogenetic classification of E. coli clones isolated
from faeces of the three groups of children is shown in Figure 1. The total number of isolates belonging to both
commensal groups (A+B1) and the total number of isolates belonging to both virulent groups (B2+D) did not
differ significantly between the three populations of children under study. However, differences were observed in
the abundance of each of the four phylogenetic groups. In
healthy children, A and B1 E. coli groups were equally distributed, while in active and non-active coeliac patients
almost all the commensal isolates belonged to group A (P
< 0.001), revealing lower E. coli diversity in clones from
coeliac patients. Significant differences were found
between the prevalence of virulent clones isolated from
active or non-active coeliac patients and healthy children.
In healthy individuals, virulent isolates were equally represented by both groups B2 and D. In contrast, group B2
was the main virulent group isolated from active coeliac
patients (P = 0.0002), and group D was that most common in non-active coeliac patients (P = 0.0001).
Virulence-associated gene carriage in E. coli clones from
coeliac and healthy children
The prevalence of virulence-associated genes in commensal groups (A+B1) and virulent groups (B2+D) of E. coli
clones isolated from active and non-active coeliac and
control children are shown in Table 1. Overall, virulent E.
coli clones (B2 + D) from healthy individuals carried fewer
virulence-associated genes than those from active and non
active coeliac patients. Both active and non-active coeliac
patients had a significantly higher prevalence of P fimbriae gene (papC), (P = 0.002–0.050) than healthy controls. In addition, type-1 fimbriae gene (fimA) prevalence
was higher in both active and non-active coeliac patients
than in healthy controls but the differences were not significant (P = 0.06). Capsule K1 gene (neuB) was also more
prevalent in both active and non-active coeliac patients
than in healthy controls; however, differences were not
significant. Capsule K5 gene (KfiC) was significantly more
common in virulent E. coli isolates from active coeliac
children than in those from non-active coeliac children (P

significantly less common in commensal E. coli isolates

from active coeliac children than in the other groups (P <
0.001). Moreover, aerobactin gene (iutA) was more common in commensal E. coli clones isolated from healthy
controls than those from active coeliac individuals (P <
0.001).

Discussion
Significant differences were revealed in the diversity and
virulence-gene carriage of Enterobacteriaceae and E. coli
clones isolated from faeces of active and non-active coeliac patients and healthy controls, suggesting that this bacterial group could be primarily or secondarily involved in
coeliac disease.

Figure 2 shows the prevalence of virulence-associated
genes in commensal groups (A+B1) and virulent groups
(B2+D) of E. coli clones isolated in this study. S fimbriae
(sfaD/E), P fimbriae (papC), haemolysin (hlyA) and capsule K5 (KfiC) genes were significantly more common in
virulent E. coli clones than in commensal clones (P <
0.05). Accordingly, P fimbriae (papC), haemolysin (hlyA)
and capsule K5 (KfiC) genes prevalence was associated
with one or both coeliac patient groups, which would suggest that E. coli clones from patients have a higher pathogenic potential than those from controls. No differences
were detected in the carriage of type 1 fimbriae (fimA), Dr
haemagglutinin (draA), capsule K1 (neuB) and aerobactin
(iutA) genes between the commensal and virulent E. coli
groups. Furthermore, the distribution of these genes was
either less remarkable or bore no relationship with coeliac
disease.

E. coli was the most common member of the Enterobacteriaceae family isolated from human faecal samples of
healthy and coeliac disease children. This result is consistent with a previous study of 49 coeliac and healthy children, in which the main Enterobacteriaceae species
detected was E. coli. In the aforementioned study, the ratio
of E. coli to Enterobacteriaceae was greater in active coeliac
children than in healthy controls [13]. Furthermore,
biopsy specimens taken from paediatric patients with
inflammatory bowel disease also revealed that E. coli was
the most common Enterobacteriaceae species detected in
MacConkey agar [16]. Thus, a reduction in the relative
abundance of non-E. coli species is associated with coeliac
disease and could favour the predominance of harmful
clones in the gut ecosystem.

Although several Enterobacteriaceae colonies were often
selected from a sample, because they differed morphology
and were suspected to represent different strains, they
often turned out to be identical regarding their phylogenetic classification and virulence-associated gene patterns,
usually some of them represented the same clone. This
can be explained by the fact that only one clone usually
dominates human gastrointestinal gut so that the other
clones are not detectable [17].
The phylogenetic groups A, B1, B2 and D were found in
different proportions in healthy, active coeliac and nonactive coeliac patients. This fact also suggests links
between lower diversity of intestinal E. coli population
and coeliac disease. In healthy children, isolates of each of
the four groups were found in equal proportions. By contrast, isolates belonging to groups A and B2, followed by
those of group D dominated the composition of E. coli
microbiota in active coeliac children, while integrants of
group B1 were not isolated; group D was the most common in non-active coeliac disease, followed by groups A,
B2, and B1. These results reflect imbalances in the composition of the four E. coli phylogenetic groups in coeliac disease children, revealing the most remarkable differences
between non-active coeliac patients and healthy controls.
In patients with IBD, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, B2 and D phylogenetic groups were more prevalent than in the control group. Moreover, a relationship
was established between the presence of serine protease
autotransporter proteins (SPATE) or adhesins in B2+Dpositive E. coli isolates [18]. In active coeliac patients, the
dominance of group B2 virulent clones could provide
pathogenic inflammatory factors either causative or consequence of the inflammatory status associated with gluten intake in the active phase of this disorder creating a
vicious circle. Nowrouzian et al. [19] concluded that
group D strains preferentially colonize infants with less
complex intestinal microbiota, since this group is more
abundant than others in one-year-old infants. Both
genetic make-up and gluten-free diet could contribute to
changes in the gut milieu of non-active coeliac patients,
leading to a predominant colonization of the virulent D
group in detriment to the others. In fact, lower total bacterial populations have been detected in duodenal samples taken from this population group when compared
with active coeliac patients and controls [12].
Overall, E coli clones of the virulent phylogenetic groups
(B2+D) isolated from active and non-active coeliac
patients, carried a higher number virulent genes than
those from healthy controls. A higher prevalence of P fimbriae gene (papC) was found in coeliac patients as compared to healthy children, regardless of the phase of this
disorder; however, the association of type-1 fimbriae
(fimA) and S fimbriae (sfaD/E) gene carriage with coeliac
disease was not so evident. Significant differences in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-230X/8/50

carriage of type-1 fimbriae (fimA) gene were not detected
in the group of children under study but E. coli clones
from active and non-active coeliac disease isolates tended
to carry fewer type-1 fimbriae (fimA) genes than those
from healthy children. Previous studies have indicated
that the proportion of type-1 fimbriated E. coli is lower in
IgA-deficient subjects than in control individuals [20,21]
and this may also be the case for coeliac disease patients
since this disease is associated with IgA deficiency. E. coli
adhesins, including P fimbriae, confer mannose-resistant
(MR) adherence to intestinal epithelial cells. MR adhesions are well-know virulence factors in urinary-tract
infection, septicaemia and meningitis. Strains that persist
in the human intestinal microbiota (resident strains) are
more often P fimbriated, whereas S fimbriated E. coli are
not associated with long-term persistence in the gut of
healthy individuals [20,22]. Thus, the significantly higher
prevalence of P fimbriae E. coli clones in treated and
untreated coeliac patients constitutes a novel link between
gut microbiota and coeliac disease, and revealed that gut
health may be compromised in these subjects, even when
subjected to a gluten-free diet.
A higher prevalence of capsular K5 gene (kfiC) of E. coli
clones belonging to the virulent groups was associated
with active coeliac disease, while a similar but less remarkable trend was found in non-active coeliac patients, as
compared to controls. Capsular polysaccharides are
known to render bacterial surfaces hydrophilic and negatively charged, making the bacterium resistant to entrapment in mucus. In addition, capsules contribute to
virulence by protecting bacteria from phagocytosis and
possibly from serum killing, in part by blocking activation
of the alternative complement pathway [23,15].
Moreover, a higher prevalence of the haemolysin (hlyA)
gene in E coli clones of the virulent groups was associated
with non-active coeliac patients in particular. α-Haemolysin is the most common cytolytic protein secreted by
haemolytic E. coli strains. Haemolysin activity might contribute to persistence by attacking enterocytes and releasing nutrients for the bacteria. In fact, E. coli appears to use
membrane lipids as its main nutrient source in the large
intestine [23,24].
It has also been confirmed that E. coli clones of the virulent groups (B2 + D) carried more virulent-associated
genes than those of commensal groups (A + B1), with the
exception of the aerobactin gene (iutA). Remarkably,
genes for S (sfaD/E) and P fimbriae (papC), K5 capsule
(kfiC) and haemolysin (hlyA) were significantly more
common in virulent E. coli clones than in commensal
strains of our population groups. In agreement, genes
coding for virulence-associated genes have been found
more frequently in pathogenic strains than in commensal
strains [8,23]. In addition, virulent E. coli isolates (B2 + D)
Page 6 of 7

BMC Gastroenterology 2008, 8:50

have previously been shown to carry virulence-associated
genes more commonly than commensal clones
[10,25,26]. Virulence-associated genes are usually
encoded on pathogenicity islands (PAIs) providing a
mechanism for coordinated horizontal transfer of virulence genes, thus favouring dissemination of pathogenic
determinants, as could be the case in the gut ecosystem of
coeliac patients [27].

Conclusion
This study has demonstrated changes in Enterobacteriaceae
diversity and increases in virulence-gene carriage in E. coli
clones isolated from coeliac patients when compared to
those from healthy controls. Thus, the results support the
hypothesis that dysbiosis may constitute a virulence factor
contributing to pathogenesis and full expression of coeliac disease. Further studies should be carried out to correlate the virulence gene carriage with specific pathogenic
roles that E. coli clones could play in this disorder.
