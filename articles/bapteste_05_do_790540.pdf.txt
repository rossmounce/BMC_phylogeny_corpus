Abstract
Background: Since Darwin's Origin of Species, reconstructing the Tree of Life has been a goal of
evolutionists, and tree-thinking has become a major concept of evolutionary biology. Practically,
building the Tree of Life has proven to be tedious. Too few morphological characters are useful for
conducting conclusive phylogenetic analyses at the highest taxonomic level. Consequently,
molecular sequences (genes, proteins, and genomes) likely constitute the only useful characters for
constructing a phylogeny of all life. For this reason, tree-makers expect a lot from gene
comparisons. The simultaneous study of the largest number of molecular markers possible is
sometimes considered to be one of the best solutions in reconstructing the genealogy of organisms.
This conclusion is a direct consequence of tree-thinking: if gene inheritance conforms to a tree-like
model of evolution, sampling more of these molecules will provide enough phylogenetic signal to
build the Tree of Life. The selection of congruent markers is thus a fundamental step in
simultaneous analysis of many genes.
Results: Heat map analyses were used to investigate the congruence of orthologues in four
datasets (archaeal, bacterial, eukaryotic and alpha-proteobacterial). We conclude that we simply
cannot determine if a large portion of the genes have a common history. In addition, none of these
datasets can be considered free of lateral gene transfer.
Conclusion: Our phylogenetic analyses do not support tree-thinking. These results have
important conceptual and practical implications. We argue that representations other than a tree
should be investigated in this case because a non-critical concatenation of markers could be highly
misleading.

Background
Tree-thinking, the explanation of evolutionary events in
the context of a tree, has inspired many philosophers and
evolutionists [1]. Some tree-thinkers classically employed
this pattern, labelling it the "organismal tree," and arguing

that it depicts the dividing pattern of cells, the path of the
envelope division of living beings through time [2] (if no
cell-cell fusion occurs [3]). Other authors, even if they
have retained this drawing to describe evolution, have
redefined the meaning of the tree as a "prevailing trend in

the evolution of genome-scale gene sets rather than as a
complete picture of evolution" [4]. In any case, the reconstruction of the vertical history is decisive and relies on
defining sets of congruent characters [5-7]. At the morphological level, such comparable characters are hardly
identifiable. In prokaryotes, it is only with the advance of
molecular phylogenetics that classification has experienced a hopeful yet limited rebound [8]. For a treethinker, the use of orthologue genes could unite practical
and conceptual advantages. They allow us to describe the
organism from the molecules, because they fit perfectly
within the traditional approach of molecular phylogenetics for which the history of genes tells the history of species. They provide a vast quantity of comparable
characters, and since they have been inherited from ancestor to descendants, they should likely be congruent,
retracing the history of species diversification [9]. Such
ideal markers are needed to reconstruct a convincing phylogenetic tree, if the tree is the right model for representing
evolution.
In practice, the identification of congruent genes is mostly
based on exclusion of potentially incongruent markers
(i.e., paralogues, xenologues). Only broadly distributed
orthologues are generally retained, if their individual phylogenies do not support apparently odd relationships
[7,9-11]. The set of candidate congruent markers is sometimes further tested. Genes are concatenated to maximise
the phylogenetic signal they contain, and a best tree is
inferred from this large dataset. Statistical approaches are
then used to test whether individual markers reject this
best tree. If they fail to reject it, genes are claimed to be
congruent with it. If some genes reject it, they are secondarily excluded from the core. This process is repeated until
the dataset stabilizes.
Generally, these successive conditions allow the retention
of a small minority of the genes present in an initial set of
genomes [7]. The quantity of molecular information in
these genes might thus be critical in resolving ancient phylogenetic relationships. In this context, simultaneous
analyses are seen as the logical solution to produce a
robust tree:supertrees [12-14] or a posteriori consensus
approaches [15] can be employed. Supertree methods
assemble an input set of separate phylogenetic trees with
shared taxa into a larger tree [13,16] (or several trees). By
fitting variously supported clades together, they allow
large phylogenies based on different characters to be constructed rapidly and have been applied to a broad range of
species [17]. Consensus approaches, such as sequences
concatenation [5,18] or by averaging over a large number
of genes [19,20] produce resolved phylogenies by overwhelming noise with signal that is presumed to be systematically congruent and historically true, though weak.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/33

These approaches, aiming to produce a tree-like pattern
whether the tree is the right model for representing evolution or not, are derived from a tree-thinking perspective.
This could, however, be flawed, and deserves criticism on
conceptual and statistical grounds. First, some genes have
been shown not to follow a simple model of inheritance.
For instance, lateral transfers of genetic material are common in nature. All living systems from viruses [21] to
eukaryotes [22] can participate in the transfer of genetic
material. They occur within domains of life, but also
across domains, for different markers. There is now broad
general agreement that lateral gene transfer (LGT) is a
major force in the evolution of prokaryotes [23-27]. Additional evidence suggests that gene transfer might also be
an important evolutionary mechanism in protist evolution. Andersson et al. [28] recently reported that alanyltRNA synthetase had been transferred from Nanoarchaeota to Diplomonads and Parabasalids. The same authors
[29] showed that LGT has affected both eukaryotes and
prokaryotes with respect to glutamate dehydrogenase.
Recombination is also an issue for tree-reconstruction.
Software such as Splitstree [30] or T-Rex [31] were developed to acknowledge this. A tree-thinker may choose to
ignore conflicting signal as if it was noise, even if legitimate evolutionary events underlie it [18]. However, if this
"noise" is in fact bona fide phylogenetic signal, then maybe
tree-thinking is inappropriate.
The failure of individual markers to reject a concatenation-tree [7] is not a real test that genes are congruent.
There are many reasons why a single gene can fail to reject
a tree issued from a concatenation, many of which do not
imply that these genes are effectively in favour of this single history [32]. Briefly, the best tree of a concatenation,
being an average of the weak signals and noise in many
genes can be a central tendency with very low discriminative power. The fact that every gene "agrees" with such a
tree does not mean the concatenation tree is true, just that
it reflects a part of the signal/noise of every gene. Importantly, this apparent "agreement" is also expected if individual markers contain very little phylogenetic signal. A
weak marker would fail to reject most of the test trees, not
only the concatenation tree.
The relative weakness of individual markers can be tested
statistically when considering not only the concatenation
tree but also many different trees. If several different
topologies cannot be rejected by a given gene, then, unfortunately, its phylogeny does not tell us much about its
actual history. For this reason, some analyses of congruence use multiple alternative test topologies [11,33]. Such
analyses describe each gene by a list of likelihood or p-values associated with a set of given topologies. These lists
are summarized in a large matrix of genes and topologies,
which is subsequently treated by clustering methods. For

instance, in principal component analyses (PCA), each
gene is represented as a point in a two-dimensional projection of its position in n-dimensional space, the coordinates for each gene in that space being related to its degree
of support for each of the n tree topologies tested. Thus,
genes supporting and rejecting the same sets of trees
should group together, constituting a cloud, while genes
with atypical support/rejection patterns of topologies
should be displayed elsewhere on the PCA [10]. Most of
the time, PCAs produce a central cloud containing most of
the markers. From this, authors generally conclude that
the markers in a cloud are congruent [10,11]. However,
again, a cloud of genes in a PCA may have various explanations, which differ from each gene in a cloud supporting the same history. Genes can still be lacking signal. The
set of topologies might be too restricted or biased to allow
discrimination between genes: if the vast majority of the
topologies are very unlikely, none of them will ever be
favoured, and differential clustering is unexpected. Yet, in
no case would common rejection of unlikely topologies
assess that the markers are congruent. Finally, even genes
with different robust signal (i.e., due to recent LGT) might
cluster together on a PCA, if the set of test-topologies does
not allow us to identify this relationship.
Interestingly, these features can be investigated more
explicitly by an alternative statistical approach: the heat
map [34]. We have thus decided to re-explore the congruence in some datasets of orthologues with this method.
Briefly, heat maps (HMs) generate graphs through hierarchical or partitional clustering. They allow the simultaneous display and clustering of all combinations of genes
and test conditions together [35-37]. Thus genes that have
the most similar responses to topologies, and topologies
that are the most similar in terms of the responses they
evoke from genes, can be independently identified. More
precisely, when applied to phylogenetics, "responses" are
p-values for each set of genes, given those topologies.
Clustering of genes allows identification of one or more
set of genes that might share a common evolutionary history. Clustering of topologies allows us to identify which
trees are equally or nearly equally supported, and thus to
assess how many distinct "best trees" there might be for a
dataset of genes.
In this paper, we investigate the phylogenetic signal of
four datasets in order to address a simple question: do the
phylogenies of orthologs really favour tree-thinking and
thus justify attempts of tree-reconstruction? Can we be
reasonably confident that their history is free of LGT? We
observe that no unique common history can be established for these genes. In all cases, genes fail to favour a
single tree. We also observe that some of these genes support incongruent histories. Consequently, the tree-thinking on which gene concatenations rest does not proceed

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/33

from phylogenetic conclusions, nor is it a priori a safe phylogenetic practice. We argue that using only the robustly
resolved parts of individual phylogenies without necessarily expecting a tree as a result is likely more appropriate.

Results and discussion
Testing the phylogenetic information of datasets of
orthologues
We used heat map analyses to investigate both the congruence and the absence of LGT in four selections of orthologues, two features that would be in favour of the
reconstruction of an organismal tree, recently challenged
by multiple analyses of comparative genomics. Indeed, it
was showed that gene gains and gene losses contributed to
the evolution of a substantial majority of orthologous sets
of prokaryotic proteins [38-40]. Such results suggested
that the simple notion of a single Tree of Life that would
accurately and definitively depict the evolution of all life
forms was gone forever [4]. Wolf et al. [4] concluded that
the concept of a tree could only be rescued by weakening
its meaning, and considering it only as "a central trend in
the rich patchwork of evolutionary history, replete with
gene loss and horizontal transfer events".

To test whether the reconstruction of any organismal tree
was then phylogenetically justified when simultaneously
using multiple orthologues, our heat maps contain two
kinds of markers: artificial ones, with up to three simulated LGT events, and actual ones. A red rectangle at the
left of the heat map identifies the actual markers, while a
blue rectangle indicates the artificial markers (Figure 1).
For each dataset, a set of plausible topologies was selected
from the study of the phylogenetic signal of the markers.
These plausible topologies correspond to the trees supported by a large majority of the markers. The support was
estimated as the p-values from the AU test. This support is
displayed in the heat map through a colour code. Lighter
colours indicate a higher probability of the data given the
tree (that is, stronger support) while greener colours indicate lower probabilities (stronger rejection). Heat maps
were also double-clustered to group genes with similar
pattern of support/rejection along columns, and to group
topologies receiving similar support/rejection along rows.
These hierarchical clusters are represented by a tree of
genes and a tree of topologies along the heat map. Hence,
to know which and how many topologies a given gene
supports, one simply needs to look along its corresponding column in the heat map. If a gene is very discriminatory and favours only a few topologies, the column will be
mostly green. In contrast, a gene with a weak phylogenetic
signal is unable to decide between multiple topologies
and its column is mostly light-coloured.
We feel that our heat maps challenge the use of a tree-like
pattern to describe molecular evolution. There was always

Figure 1A. displays the heat map for the archaeal dataset, Figure 1B. for the eukaryotic dataset. Heat maps include two kinds of
markers: actual ones, indicated by a red rectangle at the left of the heat map, and artificial markers with extreme LGT (see
main text), indicated in blue. They are based on a set of plausible topologies (see main text). The number of genes and topologies in the analysis are indicated on the heat map. These heat maps are double-clustered by genes and by topologies. The hierarchical clusters are represented by a tree of genes and a tree of topologies along the heat map. In the left band, the relative
distribution of red and blue rectangles reflects the presence/absence of clustering of actual markers with artificial ones. Inside a
heat map each dot of colour corresponds to the p-value for a given gene and a given topology. The p-values range from 0
(rejection) to 1 (support). The colour code associated with these p-values (from green for rejection to white for support) are
reported above the heatmap. On the right of each heat map, the orange brackets indicate regions containing markers with a
weak discriminatory power; the green brackets indicate regions containing markers with a stronger discriminatory power.
Amongst the markers with a stronger phylogenetic signal, pink arrows point to some instances of conflicting signal in actual
markers. They indicate different columns displaying a contrasting pattern of colour and contradictory p-values for several
orthologues in a dataset.

more than one plausible topology retained (see Additional file 1 for a description of the diversity of these plausible topologies). Archaeal and eukaryotic markers
favoured 60 and 92 topologies, respectively (Figures 1A
and 1B), and alpha-proteobacterial markers (Figure 2A)
favoured 12 different trees. Among those best topologies,
none are supported by all the genes. Instead, a given
topology is accepted by some markers and rejected by others, leading to multiple multicolour lines in mosaic heat
maps. The absence of an entirely light line means that

genes fail to agree on a single topology, even though they
reject many of them and thus do contain some phylogenetic signal. This seems compatible with the redefined
"weak" view of the tree. By contrast, the bacterial markers
were apparently more discriminating and retained two
plausible trees only (Figure 2B), one of which was supported by most of the actual markers. Furthermore, these
two topologies are compatible. Could these results support an organismal tree? In fact, these trees consist of two
star-phylogenies, which differ only in their ability to

recover the monophyly of proteobacteria, and do not
resolve any deep relationships between accepted monophyletic groups otherwise. The absence of basal resolution
leaves all possibilities concerning the process of molecular
evolution in bacteria open. Such a star-tree can be
explained either by multiple ancient LGT events, a radiation, or the lack of ancient phylogenetic signal.
Interestingly, even though many positive controls for LGT
are easily identified by the heat map by their propensity to
reject the plausible topologies, the discrimination
between actual markers and artificial ones is far from
absolute. Some artificial genes cannot be distinguished
from groups of actual markers (Figures 1B and 2A). In all
the heat maps, a significant proportion of weakly discriminating genes is present. We do not know how vertical
their phylogenetic history is, because not only do they
agree with many different trees, but sometimes they also
cluster with artificial markers. Moreover, some actual
genes behave as groups of markers with transfers (see Fig-

ures 1A and 2B, for instance) and constitute common
clusters of markers rejecting most of the plausible topologies. It is tempting to suggest that these genes may have
undergone LGT. This would be the case for instance for
rpl37ae, rpl15e in archaea (Figure 1A) or fmt in bacteria
(Figure 2B).
Finally, independently of the positive controls, actual
markers with a strong phylogenetic signal do not necessarily agree. We indicated by pink arrows some instances
where conflicting patterns of colour are observed. Every
heat map presents several such cases. These disagreements
between orthologues and also sometimes the rejection of
all plausible trees cannot be taken as evidence that there is
a unique true tree for all these genes. We will investivage
these cases further in the near future. The message of these
heat map analyses is rather that we do not know if orthologues of these datasets share a unique history or not, and
there is reason to suspect that they might not.

the line thickness of an internal branch corresponding to the frequency of its support across the whole dataset. Support was
considered significant when clades received > 50% bootstrap support. Putative LGT events are in orange, connecting donors
(circles) with recipients (arrowheads); where there are multiple possible donor candidates, these converge onto a double
arrowhead. This happens when the clade founded by a past LGT donor may have subsequently had its species membership
obfuscated by later exchanges of genetic material, yielding a non-reference assemblage of species labels in a presumed lineage.
Where the apparent donor of a gene falls outside of the taxa included in the analysis, one is created as a basal group taxon,
indicated in light blue. In order to avoid graphical congestion, branches in the tree may be artificially extended, as dotted
segments.

Attempted departure from tree-thinking
Let's then forget the tree-pattern and briefly consider one
instance of what a different but cautious phylogenetic
method could teach us. We further explored the dataset of
alpha-proteobacteria, for which we had concluded that

the presence of LGT could not be rejected nor could the
existence of a unique history be proven. We freed ourselves from a priori tree-drawing constraints and, with the
simple goal of summarizing the safe phylogenetic information of each marker, we obtained a graph that is not a

tree. In this synthesis (Figure 3), 25 vertical branches are
visible as well as 4 lateral branches. The comparison of the
total support for the horizontal and vertical branches indicates that the vertical signal is about 15 times more important than the horizontal signal. A large majority of the
genes in this dataset (30/34) does not seem to have been
laterally transferred, and many parts of the inferred vertical backbone are relatively robust. However, only node
3A, the clade of Rickettsiales, is supported by all the 34
gene trees. In all the other cases, we would not be right to
claim that the vertical backbone corresponds to the common history for all or even most of the markers. For
instance, 21 genes do not tell anything about node 2A.
Why should we then assume that these 21 markers were
subjected to this pattern of vertical inheritance? Certainly,
phylogeny alone does not tell us that, and the synthesis
shows us clearly that we simply do not know what the history of most genes is, for most of the nodes. Finally, there
are still 4 genes (rps19, rps10, rpl14 and rpoB) that have
likely undergone LGT. LGT between these species
occurred only once, thus no generality can be inferred
from them, except that 75% of them correspond to local
rearrangements of the concatenation tree. More precisely,
rps19 was transmitted from Ehrlichia to Neorickettsia, rpl14
was transmitted from Mesorhizobium to Agrobacterium and
rps10 of Rhodobacter apparently comes laterally from a
species not studied in this dataset. The origin of the rpoB
of Rhizobiales is, however, more complex and it cannot
be mapped directly onto the reference tree, since multiple
donors are possible.

Conclusion
Heat map analyses are powerful statistical methods to
investigate correlations in multiple markers. Certainly,
any conclusion deduced from their study depends on the
set of topologies, genes and p-values investigated. However, this cannot be seen as a rebuttal in itself to reject this
approach. In fact, the same issue arises for any phylogenetic and statistical analyses comparing trees. Importantly, some propositions could be extrapolated from
these heat maps applied to the three domains of Life. First,
we observed several cases where it was impossible to separate markers with an extremely atypical phylogenetic signal from actual markers. More than a weakness of the
method (PCA does the same, data not shown), this might
be explained by a relative weakness of the phylogenetic
signal contained in many markers. What we report then is
simple and sadly not surprising: the genes of eukaryotes
and alpha-proteobacteria, for instance, cannot really discriminate between several different topologies. This
absence of convergence on a single topology is obviously
not evidence for LGT in itself. It is, however, a major issue,
since it indicates that with phylogenetic analyses and statistical tools only, we often cannot decide if LGT is present
in datasets of orthologues. The broad bacterial and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/33

archaeal datasets seem principally free from such extreme
recent events. Indeed, in their heat maps, the majority of
genes with transfer can be separated from actual markers.
There are, however, some instances of LGT in these heatmaps too, since they present clusters of genes with LGT
rejecting all the plausible topologies in which some actual
markers are also found. Hence, overall, there is no strong
phylogenetic evidence that any of these datasets are really
comprised of congruent genes.
This could be problematic because phylogeneticists,
raised as classical tree-thinkers, often desire a tree or a
supertree. We feel that they might be prone to forget/
accept the fundamental weaknesses of the markers they
use to reconstruct the past. It could matter because if these
analyses mix together markers with arguably different histories, the phylogenetic Tree of Life will be simply a phenetic tree, a "Trend of Life," averaging noise, signal, and
different histories of markers to fit an a priori pattern. In
other words, a phylogeneticist who would assume that he
had reconstructed the organismal tree from orthologues
and produced a genealogy of organisms instead of a central tendency might be a victim of an extreme version of
tree-thinking. Yet, no phylogeneticist has to be an extreme
tree-thinker anymore, because there is no phylogenetic
evidence for that. Consequently, we see the present conclusion as a positive one. In fact, this work should encourage attempts to explore more accurately the phylogeny of
organisms. We propose that a safer, more punctual use of
the phylogenetic signal of orthologues could be envisioned. On one hand, "whereof one cannot speak thereof one
must be silent" applies [42], while on the other hand we
cautiously and resolutely report all the phylogenetic information that we can. Acknowledging that a strong version
of tree-thinking has still to be proven and should not be
assumed a priori, and that a weak version could be refined,
we could reduce the risk of building a hazardous evolutionary history from the largely unknown phylogenetic
signal of orthologues. This acknowledgement would also
allow us to maximise the number of genes available for
phylogenetic analysis, instead of limiting cautious
simultaneous analyses to a few congruent markers. It may
not produce a tree in the end, but would surely be more
grounded.

core of genes identified in Brochier et al. [33]. The alphaproteobacterial dataset (34 genes: see Figure 3 for their
name, 13 species) corresponds to orthologous proteins
shared by the mitochondria of Reclinomonas and all alphaproteobacteria. All these alignments were inspected, manually refined if required, and are available upon request.
For all individual markers, preliminary analyses by NJ
using MUST.3.0 [43] and Maximum likelihood (ML)
using PROML with the JTT amino acid substitution
matrix, a rate heterogeneity model with gamma-distributed rates over four categories with the Î± parameter estimated using TREE-PUZZLE, global rearrangements and
randomized input order of sequences (10 jumbles), were
done to exclude potential non-orthologous copies, but no
such copies were identified. For each dataset, all the genes
were concatenated to calculate a best tree by ML (PROML
+ JTT model + 9 categories). Lengths of the concatenations
were approximately 6300, 7300, 7800, 5900 for archaea,
bacteria, alpha-proteobacteria, and eukaryotes, respectively. The best ML tree was calculated for each gene individually by the same methodology.
Constitution of matrices for statistical analyses
A set of topologies for each dataset was constructed to test
the congruence and the phylogenetic signal between
markers. They contain alternatives to the best concatenation tree for each dataset. The best ML tree issued from a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/33

concatenation of the markers in a dataset was used as a
reference and rearranged by moving each species of the
tree to any other possible location to simulate recent LGT
inside a reference tree. The dataset also included (i) a star
topology, (ii) topologies supporting only a single robust
monophyletic group, (iii) topologies containing all the
accepted monophyletic groups, but also showing one
event of LGT. For instance, in case (iii), the clade of Ferroplasma/Thermosplasma includes a Methanosarcina that
should have been located in another clade, under the
hypothesis of an organismal reference tree. This approach
generated a set of 868/1197/1142 and 443 test topologies
for archaea, eukaryotes, bacteria and alpha-proteobacteria, respectively. These input trees are given in Additional
file 2. They were used as user trees in TREE-PUZZLE5.1,
option -wsl, with a JTT+Î 8+I model of evolution to estimate the likelihood of each site of a given gene and global
tree likelihoods for each tree. These two sets of likelihood
values were used as input for CONSEL [44] to perform the
Approximately Unbiased (AU) test [45] and associate a pvalue to each set of generated trees.
To test if the actual markers behave differently from genes
with LGT, datasets of markers presenting different degrees
of LGT were generated as follows. We randomly assigned
the sequence of one species to another one, as if the latter
has just laterally acquired the sequence of the former.
After this operation, a gene alignment presents one additional extreme and recent LGT event. We reiterated this up
to three times per gene, generating up to three additional
LGT events in a single alignment. These alignments are the
positive controls for LGT. If the statistics of genes with
LGT are identical to those of actual markers, LGT presence
cannot be excluded.
Statistical analyses
Heat map analysis was implemented in R http://www.rproject.org/. Heat maps of p-values of the AU test were
used to test that genes support similar topologies. A spot
with a dark green colour indicates low p-values for a
topology tested for a given gene. By contrast, a spot with a
light colour indicates high p-values, i.e. good support for
this topology by a given gene. These spots of colour can be
clustered to highlight the presence of patterns of support/
rejection, by rearranging rows and columns separately for
genes and topologies, so that they correspond to a dendrogram from hierarchical clustering. In this way, clusters
of genes (topologies) showing similar patterns of support
across topologies (genes) are grouped together and easily
seen. Hierarchical clustering dendrograms were obtained
using the Euclidean distance matrix for the vectors of pvalues. The definition of the number of clusters will be
discussed in a future paper.

To completely summarize patterns of support for topologies it would be necessary to include all possible topologies. This is impractical for the data sets here (even the set
of a priori plausible topologies included makes visualization difficult). To utilize the information from tests over a
large number of topologies while easing visualization of
results, we present heat maps with a restricted set of "plausible" topologies for which the majority of genes had a pvalue larger than 0.05. This set of plausible topologies is
thus constructed under the hypothesis of interest that
genes should share support for a single topology due to
their common vertical descent. The set is also larger than
required under the hypothesis that genes come from a single topology due to common vertical descent. Under this
hypothesis, the p-values for that topology should be uniformly distributed across genes so that 95% of the genes
are expected to have p-values larger than 0.05 for this
topology. With probability larger than 0.95, at least 90 out
of 100 genes should have p-values larger than 0.05 for the
correct topology. Thus the set of plausible topologies
could be restricted to the set with p-values greater than
0.05 for 80 to 90% of the genes. Since, for the datasets
considered here, restriction to topologies with a majority
of p-values larger than 0.05 eased visualization sufficiently, we did not make further restrictions. Note that the
full set of topologies is being utilized, since with a larger
set of initial topologies, a larger set of plausible topologies
will be found. In principle, the initial set of topologies
should be large enough that all topologies satisfying the
criteria of plausibility are included.
Synthesis reconstruction
The synthesis of alpha-proteobacteria [32] was inferred
from the analyses of the 34 ML trees for 13 species. ML
trees were calculated as described above. Their bootstrap
support values represent a consensus (obtained using
CONSENSE) of 100 Fitch-Margoliash distance trees
(obtained using PUZZLEBOOT and FITCH) from pseudoreplicates (obtained using SEQBOOT) of the original
alignment. The settings of PUZZLEBOOT were the same
as those used for PROML, except that global rearrangements and randomized input order of sequences are not
available in this program. PROML, CONSENSE, FITCH
and SEQBOOT are from the PHYLIP package version 3.6a
http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html.
PUZZLEBLOOT can be obtained from the TREE-PUZZLE
website http://www.tree-puzzle.de. The clades supported
with more than 50% bootstrap support in these 34 gene
trees were compared to the concatenation tree of alphaproteobacteria using two programs: Horizstory and Lumbermill [46]. These programs can be downloaded from
http://coffee.biochem.dal.ca/. Briefly, Horizstory allows
inference of the most parsimonious scenarios involving
LGT and vertical descent to explain the common features
and the discrepancies between the concatenation tree and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/5/33

each of the 34 gene trees. Lumbermill draws the synthesis
by mapping the outcomes of these scenarios onto the reference tree. A strict consensus option was applied, meaning that only the relationships supported or inferred in
100% of the evolutionary scenarios resulting from the
comparison between the reference and a given tree were
considered in this drawing.
