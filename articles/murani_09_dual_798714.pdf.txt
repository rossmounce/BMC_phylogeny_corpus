Abstract
Background: Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1 or Osteopontin, OPN) is a multifunctional matricellular
glycoprotein involved in development and regeneration of skeletal muscle. Previously, we have
demonstrated that porcine SPP1 shows breed-related differential mRNA expression during myogenesis.
With the aim to identify putative contributing cis-regulatory DNA variation we resequenced the 5'
upstream region of the gene in the respective breeds Pietrain and Duroc. We found two single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP; [GenBank:M84121]: g.1804C>T and g.3836A>G). We focused our investigation on
the SNP g.3836A>G, because in silico analysis and knowledge about the regulation of SPP1 suggested an
effect of this SNP on a CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) responsive transcriptional
enhancer.
Results: Using electrophoretic mobility shift assay we demonstrated that, similar to human SPP1, the 3'
terminal end of the first intron of porcine SPP1 harbors a C/EBPβ binding site and showed that this binding
site is negatively affected by the mutant G allele. Genotyping of 48 fetuses per breed revealed that the G
allele segregated exclusively in Duroc fetuses with a frequency of 57 percent. Using real-time quantitative
PCR we showed that, consistent with its negative effect on a transcriptional enhancer element, the G allele
tends to decrease mRNA abundance of SPP1 in the fetal musculus longissimus dorsi (~1.3 fold; P ≥ 0.1).
Moreover, we showed that the SNP g.3836A>G leads to ubiquitous aberrant splicing of the first intron by
generating a de novo and activating a cryptic splice acceptor site. Aberrantly spliced transcripts comprise
about half of the SPP1 messages expressed by the G allele. Both aberrant splice variants differ from the
native transcript by insertions in the leader sequences which do not change the reading frame of SPP1.
Conclusion: At the 3' terminal end of the first intron of the porcine SPP1 we identified a unique, dually
functional SNP g.3836A>G. This SNP affects the function of the SPP1 gene at the DNA level by affecting a
C/EBPβ binding site and at the RNA level by activating aberrant splicing of the first intron, and thus
represents an interesting DNA-marker to study phenotypic effects of SPP1 DNA-variation.

Background
Secreted phosphoprotein 1 (SPP1 or Osteopontin, OPN)
is a matricellular glycoprotein mediating cell-adhesion, migration, -survival and -signalling via integrin and CD44
receptors [1]. In line with its versatility and widespread
expression SPP1 has been linked with various physiological and pathological events, amongst others development
and regeneration of skeletal muscle [2,3]. SPP1 is regulated by the muscle regulatory factors MYOD and MYF5
[4] and has been shown to be expressed in vitro in myoblasts and myotubes [3,5]. Uaesoontrachoon et al. [3] demonstrated that soluble SPP1 stimulates proliferation of
myoblasts whereas SPP1 deposited in extracellular matrix
promotes their differentiation. Recently we showed
upregulation of SPP1 mRNA expression in prenatal musculus longissimus dorsi (M.l.d.) at 35 and 63-77 days post
conception (dpc) in pigs, i.e. at the time points of the first
and second myogenic wave respectively, thus providing
additional, in vivo, evidence supporting involvement of
SPP1 in myogenesis. In addition we showed consistent
elevation of SPP1 mRNA level during myogenesis in the
pig breed Duroc compared to breed Pietrain, the latter
showing higher muscularity and higher proportion of fast
twitch glycolytic fibers postnatally [6]. Moreover we
mapped quantitative trait loci for the proportion of fast
twitch glycolytic fibers and pH of M.l.d. 45 minutes post
mortem on porcine chromosome 8 close to SPP1 position
[7]. To detect polymorphisms that contribute to the
breed-related differential mRNA expression of SPP1 and
which are associated with differential microstructural and
biophysical muscle properties we performed SNP screening of the upstream regulatory region. We identified and
functionally characterized a SNP located in the 3' terminal
end of the first intron in an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional enhancer [8,9].

Results
Identification and in silico characterization of SNP
g.3836A>G
We resequenced ~3.8 kb of the 5'-upstream region of the
porcine SPP1 including 5'-flanking region and promoter,
exon1, intron1, as well as exon2 and identified two SNP:
a C>T SNP in the 5'-flanking region ([GenBank:M84121]:
g.1804C>T) and an A>G SNP in the first intron ([GenBank:M84121]: g.3836A>G). Phylogenetic footprinting
of the 5'-upstream region indicated that the g.1804C>T
SNP resides in an evolutionarily poorly conserved
sequence of a repetitive element (Mammalian Interspersed Repeat; MIR) and thus most likely possesses no
function. In contrast the g.3836A>G SNP is located in an
evolutionarily conserved region at the 3' terminal end of
the first intron (Figure 1) that has been shown to harbor a
strong transcriptional enhancer in the pig and in human
[9,8]. The SNPInspector software predicted the elimination of binding sites of four transcription factors by this
SNP including CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/96

EBP), adenovirus E4 promoter binding protein (E4BP4),
thyrotrophic embryonic factor (TEF) and fork head
homologous X (FHXB). Interestingly, a CCAAT/enhancer
binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) binding site, overlapping
the site corresponding to the g.3836A>G SNP site in the
human SPP1, has been shown to be important for the
activity of the intronic enhancer [8].
The C/EBP binding site at the 3' terminal end of the first
intron of SPP1 is evolutionarily conserved in the pig and is
negatively affected by the SNP g.3836A>G
In order to examine the effect of the SNP g.3836A>G on
the binding of nuclear proteins, specifically of C/EBPβ, we
performed competitive electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA) and supershift assay respectively. Allelic
probes centered around the g.3836A>G SNP showed distinct differences in their ability to bind nuclear proteins
from porcine fetal skeletal muscle (Figure 2). The labelled
probe containing the wild-type allele A formed a
DNA:protein complex (designated "s"; Figure 2, lane 2)
which was completely absent in all binding reactions containing the labelled mutant probe G (Figure 2, lanes 812). Complex "s" was specifically competed by the addition of excess of the corresponding unlabelled probe A
(Figure 2, lane 3) or unlabelled probe bearing consensus
C/EBP binding motif (Figure 2, lane 5) respectively, but
was unaffected by the addition of a nonspecific competitor probe, in this case bearing consensus Sp1 binding
motif (Figure 2, lane 6). Addition of C/EBPβ antibody to
a binding reaction containing the labelled probe A caused
disappearance of the complex "s" and caused an evident
supershifted complex (designated "ss"; Figure 2, lane 13).
Addition of the antibody to a binding reaction containing
the labelled probe bearing the Sp1 binding motif had no
effect on the DNA:protein complexes (designated "I" and
"II"; Figure 2, lane 15) and also produced no supershifted
complex in the binding reaction containing the labelled
mutant probe G (Figure 2, lane 14), demonstrating specificity of the supershifted complex "ss". Our EMSA experiment thus provides clear evidence that C/EBPβ
participated on the formation of the complex "s" and consequently provides evidence that the C/EBPβ binding site
present in human SPP1 is evolutionarily conserved in porcine SPP1. The heterogeneity of the complex "s" is most
likely due to the presence of multiple C/EBPβ isoforms or
heterodimers with other members of the C/EBP family.

Competitive inhibition of the complex "s" by addition of
100-fold molar excess of the unlabelled mutant probe G
indicates that binding of C/EBPβ is not completely abolished by the SNP g.3836A>G (Figure 2, lane 4). To characterize the effect of the g.3836A>G SNP on the C/EBPβ
binding site more precisely we performed competitive
EMSA using nuclear extracts from cells overexpressing Nterminally truncated bovine C/EBPβ (ΔN-C/EBPβ; Figure
3A). The ΔN-C/EBPβ spans the bovine C/EBPβ from

amino acids 155 to 348, i.e. it retains the DNA-binding
domain and the bZIP domain [10]. The complex formed
between the labelled probe A and ΔN-C/EBPβ was competed away using 5-100 fold molar excess of unlabelled
probe A and G respectively. The decrease in relative intensity of the complex as a consequence of increasing unlabelled competitor concentration is an indication of the
efficiency of displacement, thereby reflecting the relative
affinity of the respective alleles to C/EBPβ. The efficiency
of displacement of the cold competitor probe G is more
than twofold lower compared to the cold competitor
probe A demonstrating that the mutation reduced the
affinity of the binding site to C/EBPβ in excess of twofold
(Figure 3B).
SNP g.3836A>G decreases mRNA abundance of SPP1 in
fetal M.l.d
To examine whether the reduced affinity of the C/EBPβ
binding site due to SNP g.3836A>G leads to differential
mRNA expression of SPP1 in vivo we genotyped 12 fetuses

per each breed (Pietrain and Duroc) and stage (49, 63, 77
and 91 dpc) with expression data from a previous study
[6]. The SNP turned out to be fixed for the ancestral A
allele in the Pietrain fetuses, segregating only amongst the
Duroc fetuses with a frequency of 57% of the mutant G
allele. The analysis of the effect of the SNP on SPP1 mRNA
expression was therefore performed within the Duroc
breed. The data were pooled across the four stages, which
was accounted for in the statistical model. The results
revealed a decreasing trend in the SPP1 mRNA abundance
associated with the mutant G allele (P = 0.08; Figure 4A).
Quantification and separate analysis of SPP1 mRNA
expression in M.l.d. of additional seven 91 dpc fetuses per
each genotype class revealed similar, although less pronounced, decreasing tendency (Figure 4B). The decreasing
trend in mRNA abundance of SPP1 associated with the G
allele is consistent with the evidence of an altered function
of the mutated C/EBPβ binding site which normally acts
as a transcriptional enhancer. With regard to the breedrelated differences in the mRNA expression of SPP1 gene

that the mutant G allele causes aberrant splicing of the
first intron thus generating heterogeneity in the 5'
untranslated region. Two aberrantly spliced transcript variants were identified: one variant with 10 bp longer leader
sequence spliced at the de novo 3'ss generated by the G
allele, and another with a 36 bp longer leader sequence
spliced at a cryptic 3'ss located in the first intron 24 bp
upstream of the g.3836 SNP site (Figure 5B). The insertions do not lead to a change in the SPP1 reading frame
and also do not generate open reading frames upstream of
the translation start site that could reduce translational
efficiency. Inspection of the 3' terminal region of the first
intron revealed two additional potential 3'ss between the
authentic 3'ss and a putative branch site and one additional potential 3'ss between the cryptic 3'ss and a putative cryptic branch site. To describe the splicing pattern in

more detail we quantified relative amounts of the splice
variants in M.l.d. across different fetal stages and across
various tissues/cell types of adult animals including tonsil, intestinal lymph node, liver, spleen, pituitary, adrenal
gland, M.l.d., subcutaneous fat and leukocyte by fragment
analysis on MegaBACE capillary sequencer. Only heterozygous adult carriers were available. We found aberrant
splicing of SPP1 mRNA across all examined tissues of the
carriers of the mutant G allele. No additional splice variants were detected by the more sensitive analysis on the
capillary sequencer. The relative amounts of the three
splice variants were allele dosage dependent; in
homozygous GG animals the proportion of native: de
novo: cryptic splice variants was about 56: 19: 25 and in
heterozygous AG animals the proportion was about 78: 9:

menting maximum entropy modelling (ME), to examine
the strength of the different identified active and potential
3'ss in silico. Vorechovsky [11] showed that this method
performs best in the prediction of the utilization of aberrant 3' ss. MaxEntScore revealed that the mutation weakened the 3'ss, with the ME score of the authentic 3'ss
dropping from 7.86 to 3.13 for the mutated authentic 3'ss
respectively. The ME score of the cryptic 3'ss (6.9) is
higher than that of the de novo 3'ss (1.33). The three
potential 3'ss had low scores (in direction from 3' to 5': 8.81, -10.09 and 0.48) in accord with the fact that they are
not used in vivo.

Discussion
The total number of myofibers and to some extent their
metabolic and contractile properties are determined during the process of myogenesis. Insights into the regulation
of this process will consequently bring about better
knowledge of factors affecting postnatal growth and function of skeletal muscle. We previously discovered breedrelated differences in mRNA expression of porcine SPP1
during myogenesis [6] and hypothesized that this variation might be caused by cis-regulatory DNA-variation. Cisregulatory DNA variation has been shown to affect a large

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/96

proportion (~20%) of genes [12] and in fact has already
been described in human SPP1 [13,14]. We identified an
A>G SNP at position g.3836 at the 3' terminal end of the
first intron of porcine SPP1. In silico analysis of the polymorphic sequence and knowledge about the regulation of
SPP1 in pigs and human suggested an effect of the SNP on
a C/EBPβ responsive transcriptional enhancer. Using
competitive EMSA and supershift assay we showed that
the C/EBPβ binding site found in human is present also in
the pig and is negatively affected by the mutation. As a
consequence of the reduced affinity of the C/EBPβ binding site the activity of the transcriptional enhancer is
reduced, at least in fetal M.l.d., as indicated by the downregulation of SPP1 mRNA expression by fetuses carrying
the G allele. Conservation of the C/EBPβ binding site at
the 3' terminal end of the first intron of human and porcine SPP1 points to an important function of this element
in the regulation of SPP1. The relevance of C/EBPβ in positive regulation of mRNA expression of SPP1 is further
emphasized by the identification of additional functional
C/EBP transcriptional enhancer elements in the promoter
of murine and human SPP1 [15,16]. C/EBPs are a family
of transcription factors involved in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of diverse cell types, and

play pivotal roles in a number of processes including adipogenesis [17]. However, an involvement or a precise
function of C/EBPs in myogenesis has not been described
so far.
We demonstrate that the SNP g.3836A>G is functional
also on the RNA level and causes aberrant splicing of the
first intron. We found that this effect is ubiquitous with
regard to temporo-spatial distribution which is in accord
with the fact that it creates a general splicing signal. Naturally occurring DNA-variation affecting splicing represents
a valuable resource to identify sequence signals involved
in the regulation of this process. The g.3836A>G SNP
exhibits several features of de novo 3'ss activating aberrant
splicing identified by Kralovicova et al. [18] and Vorechovsky [11]. It creates an AG dinucleotide in intron in
polypyrimidine tract of the authentic 3'ss by introducing
a guanine residue, has an uridine in position +1 relative to
the de novo 3'ss and activates a cryptic 3'ss. Vorechovsky
[11] has shown that authentic counterparts of de novo 3'ss
are intrinsically weak. In the case of the affected 3'ss of
SPP1 this is likely a consequence of the two concurrent
functional constraints on the sequence of the 3' terminal
end of the first intron; on one hand to provide a C/EBPβ
responsive transcriptional enhancer and on the other to
provide the canonical splicing acceptor signals. The in silico predicted strength of the mutated authentic 3'ss compared to the cryptic 3'ss and their utilization in vivo are
reversed. An explanation for the lower utilization of the
cryptic 3'ss compared to the mutated authentic 3'ss in vivo
may be a suboptimal sequence of the putative cryptic
branch site, in contrast to the predicted authentic branch
site which perfectly matches with the consensus sequence
YNYURAY (Figure 5B). Another explanation might be that
the cryptic 3'ss is silenced by a splicing silencer or vice versa
that the authentic 3'ss might be augmented by a splicing
enhancer. Kralovicova and Vorechovsky [19] showed that
in vivo selection of aberrant splice sites is extensively controlled by auxiliary splicing signals.
Mutations that affect hnRNA splicing account for up to
50% of disease-causing gene alterations in human and
potentially represent the most frequent cause of hereditary disorders. Some 218 unique aberrant 3'ss, activated
by disease-causing mutations in 131 genes, are presently
known in human [11]. Our results show that about half of
the SPP1 messages expressed by the G allele comprise
aberrantly spliced transcripts. Considering the versatile
function of SPP1 and the ubiquitous expression of the
aberrant splice variants it could be speculated that the
SNP g.3836A>G might have pleiotropic effects on various
traits including growth, reproduction and immune
defence. However the relatively high frequency of the G
allele argues against a major negative phenotypic effect,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/10/96

because in that case the G allele would be quickly eliminated given the high selection pressure on commercial
pigs. Furthermore, the aberrant splicing induced by the
SNP g.3836A>G does not change primary structure of the
SPP1 protein. In fact, the aberrant splicing may counteract
the negative effect of the G allele on mRNA expression of
SPP1 by enhancing translational efficiency or RNA stability. Aberrantly spliced mRNA isoforms of the human insulin gene with longer 5'-leader sequence, induced by a SNP
in its first intron, were reported to generate more proinsulin in vitro compared to the native transcripts [20].

Conclusion
Functional characterization of the SNP g.3836A>G
revealed that it has two effects; it negatively affects a C/
EBPβ binding site and activates aberrant splicing of the
first intron. However, although the SNP g.3836A>G is
functional it most likely does not represent the causative
mutation responsible for the previously observed breed
related differences in SPP1 mRNA expression. Nevertheless, the dual effect of the SNP on SPP1 function renders
it as an interesting DNA-marker for association studies
concerning muscle-related, growth, reproduction, and
immune defence traits.

Methods
Identification of SNP and splice variants
The target sequence of the porcine SPP1 gene [GenBank:M84121] was amplified in six overlapping PCR fragments using standard PCR conditions and each six
Pietrain and Duroc DNA samples respectively. A standard
PCR reaction mixture contained 100 ng genomic DNA,
0.2 μM of each primer, 50 μM of each dNTP and 0.5 U
SupraTherm Taq Polymerase in 1× supplied PCR-buffer
containing 1.5 mM MgCl2 (Genecraft, Lüdinghausen, Germany). The temperature profile consisted of 40 cycles of
denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, annealing at Ta for 30 s and
extension at 72°C for 30 s for each <0.5 kb. Amplification
products were subsequently pooled within breed and
purified using the NucleoSpin Extract II kit (MachereyNagel, Düren, Germany).

To detect alternative splice variants a cDNA fragment
spanning exons 1-6 was amplified in a standard PCR reaction and cloned using the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). The PCR products and plasmids were
sequenced using Big Dye Terminator Cycle sequencing kit
V1.1 (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) and
analyzed on ABI 310 or MegaBACE 750 automated
sequencer.
The g.3836A>G SNP was amplified in a standard PCR
reaction and genotyped using single strand conformation
polymorphism (SSCP) visualized by silver staining after

electrophoresis performed for 5 hours at 5°C on a 12%
native polyacrylamide (49:1 AA: Bis) gel in 0.5 × TBE
buffer. Sequences and annealing temperature (Ta) of
primers used for comparative sequencing, genotyping and
RT-PCR are given in Additional File 1: Table S1.
Tissue collection, RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis
Sampling of fetal M.l.d. was described in detail previously
[6]. Briefly, immediately after exsanguination of the sows
the uteri were recovered and the embryos/fetuses were
quickly removed, weighed and the M.l.d. dissected. Adult
tissue samples from performance tested animals were collected in our experimental abattoir. After dissection samples were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80°C for later analysis. Total RNA was isolated using TRI
Reagent (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany). After DNaseI
treatment (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) the RNA was
cleaned up using the NucleoSpin RNA II Kit (MachereyNagel). First strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScriptIII MMLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) in a reaction containing 1 μg RNA and
500 ng of oligo (dT)11VN primer, according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Quantification of total transcript level and relative
amounts of splice variants
Total transcript level of SPP1 and of the reference gene
RPL32 were quantified by real-time quantitative PCR
(qPCR) performed on a LightCycler 1.0 System using the
LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBRplus Green I
(Roche). The amplification was conducted in duplicate
according to manufacturer's instructions using 200 μM of
each primer. The temperature profiles consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 10 min and 45 cycles
consisting of denaturation at 95°C for 10 s, annealing at
60/55°C for SPP1/RPL32 and extension/fluorescence
acquisition at 72°C for 15 s. For both assays threshold
cycles were converted to copy numbers using a standard
curve generated by amplifying serial dilutions of an external PCR standard (107 - 101 copies). To account for variation in RNA input and efficiency of reverse transcription
the calculated SPP1 mRNA copy numbers were normalized by dividing with a normalization factor derived from
the expression of the reference gene.

To determine relative amount of splice variants the cDNA
fragment described above was amplified using a FAM
labelled primer R1F (Additional file 1: Table S1), separated on a MegaBACE 750 capillary sequencer and peak
heights were measured using the MegaBACE Fragment
Profiler v1.2 software (GE Healthcare, Munich, Germany). The relative quantity of a splice variant was calculated by dividing the corresponding peak height by the
sum of peak heights corresponding to all three splice variants.

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
Nuclear proteins from M.l.d. of 91 old fetuses were prepared essentially as described by Fürbass et al. [21]. Cells
(murine mammary epithelial cell line HC11) overexpressing N-terminally truncated bovine C/EBPβ (ΔN-C/EBPβ)
and nuclear extracts from these were prepared as
described by Yang et al. [22]. Double-stranded probes
were prepared by annealing a sense oligo with a shorter
antisense oligo (Additional file 1: Table S2) serving as a
primer of a Klenow fill-in reaction containing 5U enzyme
(Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany), 1× buffer supplied
by the manufacturer and 100 μM each dNTP or 20 μCi [α32P]dATP for labelling. Nuclear extracts (~3 μg) were incubated with 80 fmol labelled probes (40 fmol labelled
probes for EMSA using ΔN-C/EBPβ) in a binding mixture
containing 10 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.9, 50 mM KCl, 0.1
mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 μ poly(dI-dC), 10% glycerol
and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) at 20°C for 20
min. For competition experiments unlabelled probes
were added 10 min prior to addition of labelled probes.
For supershift assay 4 μg of an antibody against C/EBPβ
(sc-150X, Santa Cruz) was included into the binding reaction. Samples were subsequently subjected to electrophoresis using native 6% polyacrylamide (30:1 AA: Bis)
gels in 0.5 × TBE buffer at 20°C. After electrophoresis gels
were dried on Whatmann paper, exposed overnight to
phosphor storage screens and analysed on a STORM 840
PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Krefeld, Germany). Band intensities (peak heights) were measured
using the ImageQuant TL v2005 software (GE Healthcare). The difference in the binding affinity between the
allelic probes was estimated as the average of the ratio of
the intensity drop caused by addition of wild type A competitor divided by the intensity drop caused by mutant
competitor G for each competitor concentration.
Data analysis
Phylogenetic footprinting was performed using the Mulan
online tool accessible at the NCBI DCODE.org Comparative
Genomics
Developments
website
http://
mulan.dcode.org/. The corresponding bovine, canine,
human and murine sequences were retrieved from USCS
genome browser http://genome.ucsc.edu. Simple and
interspersed repeats were identified using Repeatmasker
http://www.repeatmasker.org. Transcription factor binding sites and the effect of the g.3836A>G SNP on these
were predicted by the SNPInspector software http://
www.genomatix.de.

The strength of the potential splice donor sites in silico was
examined using MaxEntScan http://genes.mit.edu/burge
lab/maxent/Xmaxentscan_scoreseq_acc.html. To detect
open reading frames of the sequences of the different
splice variants ORF finder was employed http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gorf/.

The effect of g.3836A>G genotype on mRNA expression of
SPP1 was analyzed using general linear model (PROC
GLM; SAS V9.1, SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC) including fixed
effects of genotype, stage and their interaction for across
stage analysis and fixed effect of genotype for the separate
analysis within stage 91 dpc. Least square mean values of
the genotypes were compared by a t-test, and the P-values
were adjusted by a Tukey-Kramer correction.
