Abstract
Background: The deep-sea, hypersaline anoxic brine lakes in the Mediterranean are among the
most extreme environments on earth, and in one of them, the MgCl2-rich Discovery basin, the
presence of active microbes is equivocal. However, thriving microbial communities have been
detected especially in the chemocline between deep seawater and three NaCl-rich brine lakes,
l'Atalante, Bannock and Urania. By contrast, the microbiota of these brine-lake sediments remains
largely unexplored.
Results: Eighty nine isolates were obtained from the sediments of four deep-sea, hypersaline
anoxic brine lakes in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea: l'Atalante, Bannock, Discovery and Urania
basins. This culture collection was dominated by representatives of the genus Bacillus and close
relatives (90% of all isolates) that were investigated further. Physiological characterization of
representative strains revealed large versatility with respect to enzyme activities or substrate
utilization. Two third of the isolates did not grow at in-situ salinities and were presumably present
as endospores. This is supported by high numbers of endospores in Bannock, Discovery and Urania
basins ranging from 3.8 × 105 to 1.2 × 106 g-1 dw sediment. However, the remaining isolates were
highly halotolerant growing at salinities of up to 30% NaCl. Some of the novel isolates affiliating with
the genus Pontibacillus grew well under anoxic conditions in sulfidic medium by fermentation or
anaerobic respiration using dimethylsulfoxide or trimethylamine N-oxide as electron acceptor.
Conclusion: Some of the halophilic, facultatively anaerobic relatives of Bacillus appear well adapted
to life in this hostile environment and suggest the presence of actively growing microbial
communities in the NaCl-rich, deep-sea brine-lake sediments.

Background
Numerous basins filled with highly saline, anoxic waters
have been discovered on the seafloor of the Eastern Med-

iterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. Within
the Eastern Mediterranean the hypersaline brine lakes are
situated on the Mediterranean Ridge, a submarine mounPage 1 of 11

tain chain emerging from subduction processes at the collision zone of the African and European tectonic plates
[1]. Tectonic processes have resulted in folded and
deformed sediments leading to seawater coming into contact with evaporites that were deposited during the
Messinian salinity crisis (5.96 to 5.33 million years ago)
[2,3]. The outcropping salt is dissolved and the resulting
highly saline brines can accumulate in depressions in the
seafloor [1]. Owing to the weak currents at such a depth
and the large difference in density, the hypersaline brines
do not mix with the overlying seawater, forming an
extremely steep chemocline at the interface with a vertical
extension of about 2 meters [4]. The hypersaline brine
lakes are unique and hostile environments, characterized
by extremely high salt concentrations, anoxia with high
sulfide concentrations, and the high pressure typical of a
deep-sea environment [5].
Four of the basins in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, l'Atalante, Bannock, Discovery and Urania basins (Fig. 1) have
been sampled and studied to better understand their biogeochemistry, ecology and biotechnological potential.
The physico-chemical properties of the hypersaline brine
lakes have been described by van der Wielen et al. [5], but
in brief l'Atalante and Bannock brines contain ions
roughly in proportion to those found in seawater but
almost at the point of sodium chloride saturation (~8
times seawater concentration). The Urania brine has a
slightly lower salinity, but exhibits one of the highest
sulfide concentrations measured in marine environments
[5,6]; it also has a very high methane concentration and in
parts an elevated temperature, possibly caused by a deep
source of the brine [7]. The Discovery basin is unique in

that it derives from bischofite (MgCl2·6H2O), resulting in
a ~5 Molar magnesium chloride brine [8], representing
the marine environment with the lowest reported water
activity [9].
Microbial activity within the basins has been demonstrated by hydrolytic enzyme activities, methanogenesis
and sulfate reduction in all four basins [5], and depletion
of 34S in sulfide, indicating microbial sulfate reduction in
Urania Basin [6,10]. However, in the MgCl2-rich Discovery brine lake, Hallsworth et al. [9] did not detect messenger RNA coding for enzymes central to sulfate reduction
and methanogenesis, and attributed this to the chaotropic
nature of MgCl2. In contrast, the seawater – brine-lake
interfaces for Bannock and l'Atalante basins have diverse
and active microbial communities largely dominated by
Bacteria [11,12]; and novel esterases that function at high
pressure and over a wide range of salinities are indicative
of microbes specifically adapted to the steep, deep-sea
halocline between seawater and Urania brine lake [13].
In the sediments of l'Atalante brine-lake, viral abundance
and virus to prokaryote abundance ratio are similar to
those reported in oxic, deep-sea sediments [14]. The phospholipid-linked fatty acid (PLFA) compositions of the
brine-lake sediments from Bannock, Urania and l'Atalante are similar to each other, and distinct from the PLFA
composition of Discovery brine-lake sediment, which is
more typical of deep-sea Mediterranean sediments outside of the hypersaline brines [15]. To date, a small
number of cultured microorganisms has been reported,
primarily from the seawater-brine lake interface of Bannock and Urania basins [6,11,16-18], but during these
studies no isolates had been obtained from the brine-lake
sediments. One of the aims of our study was to investigate
the microbiota of the brine-lake sediments, and many isolates were obtained from sediments of all four basins,
with the vast majority being spore-forming bacteria
related to the genus Bacillus.
Members of the order Bacillales are found in almost every
environment on earth from the stratosphere [19] to the
deep subsurface [20-22]. This ubiquity is, in part, attributed to their ability to form resilient spores that can be
transported over long distances [23], but a frequently
overlooked feature of the order Bacillales is their great metabolic versatility and ability to grow under physico-chemical extremes. In this study we focus on the Bacillus-related
isolates from the brine-lake sediments. Such deep-sea topographical depressions will collect all sorts of material,
including bacterial spores, but here we provide evidence
that some of the microbes from the brine-lake sediments
have the potential to be active in situ.

Results and Discussion
Sediment characteristics
In contrast to the oxidized sediments in the vicinity of the
basins, which had a beige-brown colour at the top, the
anoxic sediments within the l'Atalante and Bannock
basins were dark grey with a black surface layer approximately 1-cm thick, that was less compacted than the
underlying layer and very easily disturbed. The top layer of
the Discovery basin sediments was jet-black, and also not
very compacted and very viscous owing to the high magnesium chloride content. There was no obvious layering
of this sediment. The sediments of the Urania basin in
contrast were of a light grey color. Gas bubbles developed
in the Urania sediment shortly after retrieval of the multicorer, possibly due to out-gassing of methane or carbon
dioxide under atmospheric pressure. The upper two centimeters of the anoxic sediments were nearly liquid, so
they could only be sampled with a pipette and it was not
necessary to mix the sediment with ambient water to form
slurries before processing.
Viable cell count
The highest colony-forming units (CFU) per ml of sediment were observed on artificial seawater, with estimated
numbers of 1.1 × 104 for l'Atalante, 4.5 × 103 for Bannock,
1.3 × 103 for Urania and 5 × 102 for Discovery basins. The
number of CFU was generally one order of magnitude
lower on medium with elevated salinity (12%, medium
B/2) than on artificial seawater. No growth was observed
on medium B with 24% salinity. Total cell counts were
not available from this study, but Sass [24] obtained a
total cell count from Urania basin sediment of 3.6 × 107
cells ml-1 which was similar to counts obtained by Danovaro et al. [14] for l'Atalante basin sediments (5.7 × 107
cells ml-1; converted using a density value of 1.23 g ml-1
[5]), indicating that we cultivated about 0.004 to 0.02% of
the microbes in the sediment.

The lowest counts were found in Discovery brine-lake sediment, and given that 5 M MgCl2 inhibits growth but preserves cell structure [9], it can be assumed that this
provides a baseline for inactive but culturable microorganisms in the basin. This is supported by the findings of
Polymenakou et al. [15] that PLFA profiles from sediments in the Discovery basin were similar to those from
'normal' hemipelagic Mediterranean sediments, suggesting that the majority of the source organisms for the PLFA
were introduced into the basin by sedimentation or lateral
flows. Sediments of the other three basins (l'Atalante,
Bannock and Urania) had PLFA patterns that clearly differed from those of sediments outside the brine lakes
revealing distinct and probably active communities [15].
Two questions emerge from these observations: were isolates similar between the four basins, and do they demonstrate the potential to be active in situ?

Number and affiliation of isolates
A total of 89 strains were isolated from the sediment samples (29 from l'Atalante, 30 from Bannock, 16 from Discovery, and 14 from Urania basins). Screening by
Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA)
and partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes revealed
that 80 strains (90% of those isolated) were related to the
Bacillales. The other nine strains were related to Halomonas
aquamarina (4 strains), Pseudomonas sp. (4 strains) and
Alteromonas sp. (1 strain). Since Alteromonas and Halomonas spp. were previously shown to be dominant organisms in the chemocline but less abundant in the brine [6]
we assume that they were not indigenous sediment bacteria but introduced by sedimentation. Spore-forming bacteria however were more typically isolated from brine-lake
sediments, and only rarely from the chemocline (data not
shown). Therefore, in the present study we focused on isolates affiliating with the Bacillales. Out of the 80 strains
from the Bacillales 25 representative strains with differing
ARDRA profiles were selected for physiological characterization and detailed phylogenetic analysis. Of these 25
ARDRA groups, 17 were from one basin only, six were
found in two basins, and two were found in three basins.
There were no clear trends in the distribution of the isolates in the different basins; however, although numbers
are relatively small, it is notable that one of the ARDRA
groups represented by strain AS5, had 14 strains that were
isolated only from l'Atalante and Bannock basins, the
most geochemically similar, yet geographically distant
basins.

Most of these Bacillus-like isolates are closely related to
previously cultivated organisms (Fig. 2), many of which
are moderately halophilic or alkaliphilic. Six strains (from
l'Atalante, Urania and Bannock, but not from Discovery
basin) belong to a cluster accommodating genera with
many halotolerant representatives like Halobacillus, Virgibacillus and Pontibacillus (see Fig. 2) [25,26]. All of these
strains were isolated on a medium with elevated salt concentration (12% NaCl).
Phenotypic and physiological diversity of isolates
The isolates were Gram-positive and, with the exception
of strain BS3, formed endospores. All but four isolates
were found to be motile by peritrichous flagella (Table 1).
The pairs of strains that were phylogenetically most similar, such as AS2 and AS3, US2 and US4, US7 and BS29,
and AS6 and BS6 (Fig. 2) were also phenotypically most
similar (Fig. 3). The isolates were physiologically diverse
(Table 1) particularly when considering their enzyme
activities and substrate utilization capacities (Table 1).
Generally, the isolates grew well on yeast extract, peptone,
casamino acids and a range of carbohydrates and amino
acids, while fatty acids or alcohols were less commonly
used. A few strains grew also on aromatic compounds or

Phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA sequences of isolates from l'Atalante (AS), Bannock (BS), Discovery (DS) and Urania (US) brine-lake sediments. The
tree was constructed based on an alignment of approximately 1340 base pairs from the isolates and their closest relatives. Uncharacterized strains were
included in the tree when there was no closely related named species. For the named species, the sequence from the type strain was used. Accession numbers of reference strains are given in round brackets. The scale bar corresponds to 0.1 substitutions per nucleotide position. Figures (%) at branching
points represent significance of branching order by bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates, bootstrap values above 75% are shown). For the strains isolated
from the deep-sea brine-lake sediments, the NaCl range for growth and the ability to grow under anaerobic conditions are indicated in square brackets.

n-alkanes. Compared with the other isolates, strains DS1
and DS5 had limited catabolic capabilities, growing only
on five and three substrates, respectively. Interestingly,
one of them (strain DS1) grew well on n-alkanes.
All strains were mesophilic, growing between 12 and
37°C, indicating that they could grow within the temperature range experienced at the surface of the Mediterra-

nean and the deep-sea, including the brine lakes which
have a temperature of 13.9 to 16.7°C [5]. Some isolates
also grew at 4°C, whereas others grew at 45 or even 53°C
(Table 1). With the exception of strain US13 (minimum
salinity for growth of 0.5% NaCl), all strains grew in
media containing only 0.1% NaCl, and most had a
growth optimum between 1 and 5% NaCl, suggesting that
they were marine and incapable of growth in the brine-

lake sediments. None of the five isolates from Discovery
brine-lake sediment grew in media with an MgCl2 concentration exceeding 7.5%, and therefore were not adapted to
in-situ conditions. However, the eight strains isolated on
medium B/2 with 12% NaCl were generally the most
halotolerant (Table 1). Three of these strains (AS2, AS3
and US13) were capable of growing at extremely high salt
concentrations, similar to those in the basins. They grew
up to 30% NaCl with an optimum of 10–15% NaCl.
Strains AS2 and AS3 also grew by fermentation in anoxic
artificial seawater as well as in medium with 20% NaCl
(Table 1), and all three strains (AS2, AS3 and US13) could
use dimethylsulfoxide and trimethylamine N-oxide as terminal electron acceptors (data not shown).
Are the brine-lake sediment communities dominated by
inactive endospores?
The high proportion of Bacillus-related strains among the
isolates in this study, although no pasteurisation was performed to select for spore formers, suggests that many the
Bacillus-like isolates might originate from dormant
endospores and that most of the non-spore-forming
marine microorganisms that might drift into the brine do
not survive. This is supported by the general lack of correlation between the affiliation of the isolates and the basin
of origin, and especially by failure of many strains to grow

at in-situ salinities. Endospores can be stained by the commonly used dyes like acridine orange and DAPI [27], and
so can be expected to contribute to the total cell counts.
Endospore numbers were estimated from dipicolinic acid
(DPA) contents [28] in sediment samples from the Urania
(3.8 × 105 g-1 dw sediment), Bannock (9.0 × 105 g-1 dw sediment) and Discovery (1.2 × 106 g-1 dw sediment) basins.
These numbers are lower than those obtained from highly
active coastal sediments where endospores were estimated
to represent up to 3% of the total cell counts [28]. However, considering the low total cell counts in the range of
2.6 and 5.7 × 107 cells ml-1 (note the different unit) in the
brine-lake sediments it is apparent that the contribution
of endospores to the brine-lake sediment microbial communities is in the same range (up to 5% of the total cell
counts).
The capacity to form endospores may explain why Bacillus-like organisms can be isolated from almost all types of
environment, e.g. soils, sediments, foods and water [29],
including extreme environments like solar salterns
[30,31], deep-sea hydrothermal vents [32] or brine-lake
sediments (this study). Whether they play an important
ecological role in most of these environments remains a
matter of debate. In studies using a combination of culture-dependent and -independent methods members of

Table 1: Phenotypic characteristics of isolates from brine-lake sediments

Saline Systems 2008, 4:8

the Bacillales are often found among the isolates, but
rarely in DNA-based detection methods [33,34], suggesting that spore-forming bacteria are easily cultivated with
standard methods although they represent only a small
proportion of the microbial community. This might be
explained by the fact that bacteria in most environments
are strongly energy-limited, and it was shown that starved
cells can be severely harmed by a substrate shock after
exposure to high substrate concentrations as found in
many standard media [35]. In contrast, endospores do
contain enough energy for germination and are specifically adapted to quickly respond to substrate availability
and by forming a vegetative cell they are able to proliferate. Therefore, it can be expected that they can easily outgrow other organisms after transfer onto microbiological
media. On the other hand, endospores possess a very rigid
and resistant cell wall and it is unclear to what extent
endospores are successfully lysed and extracted using
standard nucleic-acid extraction procedures [e.g. [36]].
The spores themselves may have an important ecological
role, especially as they contribute to such a high proportion of total counts in sediments. For example, spores
have been shown to catalyse the oxidation of Mn2+ [37].
Spores of Bacillus-like organisms can rest dormant for long
time periods and they are resistant to damage through
desiccation and radiation for example [23]. Bacillus-like
organisms have been isolated from deep subsurface sediments [21,22] and from inclusions inside materials like
amber [38], salt crystals [39] or glacial ice [40,41] where
the spores must have been included since the time of deposition. The age of the inclusions in the salt crystals and
amber was estimated in the range of several million years
[38,39], the age of those in glacial ice in the range of 5 to
750,000 years [40,41].
Therefore, the spores in the basin sediments may have
drifted into the brines from environments far from the
deep-sea hypersaline anoxic basins, accumulated in the
brine-lake sediments and remained viable. The high salinity within the brine lakes could even have enhanced the
preservation of the spores [9,14,42,43]. Alternatively it
can be envisaged that they originate from the evaporites,
as viable spores were reported from salt deposits tens of
millions of years old [39], far older than the Messinian
evaporates beneath the Mediterranean Sea.
Evidence for active members of the Bacillales in brine-lake
sediments
About two thirds of the strains tested did not grow under
in-situ salinities and probably derived from dormant
spores, whereas seven strains were very halotolerant and
grew at salinities close to in-situ values. However, in the
fermentation assay only two of these (strains AS2 and
AS3) formed cultures turbid enough for photometric anal-

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/8

ysis. This is not unusual; many anaerobic bacteria form
only low biomass. This can be explained by the low
energy yield available from many fermentations. Otherwise many bacteria may rely on the activity of a syntrophic
partner which is lacking when grown in pure cultures. An
example of such bacteria are strains related to the genus
Rhizobium isolated under anoxic conditions from Mediterranean sediments [44]. None of these formed turbid cultures under anoxic conditions. Rhizobium-related
organisms were unexpected for deep-sea sediments, but
were proven to be abundant members of the sediment
microbial communities by quantitative PCR [45].
Whether the same is true for the Bacillus-like organisms in
the brine-lake sediments needs to be investigated further.
In any case, our data confirm that it is possible to isolate
Bacillus-like strains that are physiologically capable of
growing under the conditions in the brine, i.e. extremely
high salinity combined with anoxia and a sulfide concentration of several millimol per liter.

Conclusion
The topography of deep-sea hypersaline anoxic basins
makes them excellent collecting bowls for material sinking from the surface and slumping from surrounding sediments. Most of the organisms entering the brine lake will
be unable to tolerate the extreme salinity or high sulfide
concentrations and so will die and release their cellular
contents. This, together with the combined preservation
effects of anoxia and low water activity, explains why
l'Atalante brine-lake sediment has the highest concentration of extracellular DNA reported in a natural environment [14]. Spores, however, are better equipped to survive
environmental shocks, explaining why we isolated such a
high proportion of endospore-forming Bacillus-like
organisms from the brine-lake sediments. Discovery brine
lake, an almost saturated 5 M MgCl2 brine, is the most
chaotropic large-scale environment on earth, and has the
lowest water activity of any marine environment [9].
There is, however, conflicting evidence of microbial activity [5,9] in Discovery hypersaline brine. Several lines of
evidence suggest that microbial activity is not favored in
Discovery basin: undetectable mRNA from sulfate-reducing bacteria and methanogens compared with the upper
part of the chemocline and l'Atalante basin [9], similarity
of PLFA profiles with deep-sea sediments outside of the
hypersaline brine [15], and the high redox potential (10
mV) compared with the three other brine-lake sediments
(-82 to -136 mV) [15]. Here we provide evidence that Discovery Basin sediments have the lowest viable counts yet
the highest endospore counts; also this, and a previous
study [9], have shown that microbes could not be isolated, nor sub-cultured on media with MgCl2 concentrations approaching those found in Discovery brine. This
suggests that a large proportion of the microbes in Discovery sediment are inactive, but leaves open the possibility

Saline Systems 2008, 4:8

of finding novel extremophiles specifically adapted to
high concentrations of this extremely chaotropic salt.
We provide the first report of isolates from the deep-sea
hypersaline brine-lake sediments, and while most did not
have the potential to be active in situ, some isolates, clustering within the genus Pontibacillus, could grow at in-situ
salinities and under anoxic conditions, either by respiration with dimethylsulfoxide or trimethylamine N-oxide as
electron acceptor (AS2, AS3, US13) or by fermentation
(AS2, AS3). This confirms that the NaCl-dominated brinelake sediments contain active microbial populations as
demonstrated in l'Atalante basin by leucine incorporation
[14], and also supports the notion that the extremely high
sulfide concentration in Urania brine lake [5,6], known to
inhibit even sulfate-reducing bacteria [46], allows microbial processes to continue. This study raises tantalizing
questions about the origin, distribution, survival and metabolic activity of vegetative microbial cells and
endospores in some of the most extreme environments on
earth: why for example were 14 isolates with identical
ARDRA profiles found only in Bannock and l'Atalante
brine-lake sediments, the most geochemically similar, but
geographically remote basins? Answers will come from
further analysis of isolates to obtain a detailed understanding of their physiology, as well as nucleic-acid based
studies of microbial communities and endospores in,
around and above the brine-lake sediments as well inside
Messinian rock salt.

Methods
Site description and sampling procedures
Four different brine lakes in the Eastern Mediterranean
were sampled between 20th and 31st August 2001 on a
cruise with the R/V Urania. Three of them, l'Atalante, Discovery and Urania basin, are situated very close to each
other on the north-eastern edge of the Mediterranean
Ridge [47], only a few kilometers apart, whereas the Bannock basin is located on the southern edge of the ridge
[48] (Fig. 1). Samples from the upper two centimeters of
the sediments were taken with a box corer (Discovery
basin) or a multicorer (all other basins). Immediately
after retrieval, the sediment was aseptically transferred
into serum bottles. The headspace was flushed with oxygen-free nitrogen and sealed by means of butyl rubber
stoppers. Until processing, the samples were stored in the
dark at room temperature. Dilution series from the sediment samples were made with a sterile solution of 25%
NaCl.
Enrichment, isolation and cultivation
For enrichment and isolation of bacteria six different oxic
media were used, representing a combination of three different salt concentrations and two mixtures of organic
substrates. Medium B reflected the salt composition of the

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/8

Bannock basin [48]; the salinity was approximately 24%.
It contained as major salts (in g l-1): NaCl 181.2,
MgCl·6H2O 61, KCl 7.5, CaCl2·2H2O 2.2, Na2SO4 14.2,
MgBr2·6H2O 1.2, H3BO3 0.3, TRIS 2.4. Minor constituents were added from stock solutions (in mM final concentration): SrCl2 0.05, LiCl 0.075, NaF 0.07, NH4Cl 0.5,
KH2PO4 0.1. One ml of a trace element solution (SL10,
[49]) was added and the pH adjusted to 7.6 with HCl. A
solution of 10 vitamins [50] was added after autoclaving.
Medium B/2 resembled medium B, but contained only
half of the amount of the major salts. Medium SW consisted of artificial seawater which contained (in g l-1):
NaCl 24.3, MgCl2·6H2O 10, KCl 0.75, CaCl2·2H2O 1.5,
Na2SO4 4. The minor constituents, buffer and pH of the
artificial seawater were as described above, additionally
MgBr2 and H3BO3 were added from stock solutions to a
final concentration of 0.4 mmol l-1 each.
The organic substrates are denoted as CPS (casamino
acids 0.5 g l-1, bactopeptone 0.5 g l-1, soluble starch 0.5 g
l-1, glycerol 13 mmol l-1) or as M, a mixture of the following substrates (in 1 mM final concentrations, pH 7): glucose, glycerol, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium
fumarate, sodium succinate, alanine, glycine, sodium
glutamate and sodium thiosulfate.
After six weeks of incubation at 20°C colonies from each
positive plate were selected after their appearance, and
isolated by streaking out repeatedly on the respective
medium. Isolated strains were maintained on CPS-SW at
20°C. The number of CFU ml-1 sediment was estimated
from the mean number of colonies on the seawater-based
medium with organic components CPS and M, using the
calculation of Cavalli-Sforza [51].
Phenotypic characterization
Tests for the presence of oxidase and catalase, Gram-staining and staining of flagella and spores were performed
according to standard procedures [52]. For further
enzyme tests the API 20 E-system (bioMérieux, Marcy
L'Étoile, France; [53]) was used following the manufacturer's instructions. The degradation of Tween 80 and the
following polymers was determined on CPS-SW agar
(without starch) at 30°C, unless indicated otherwise. All
results were confirmed with two independent replicates of
each test. Amylase activity was detected by zones of clearing around colonies on medium with 2 g l-1 of soluble
starch (BDH Laboratories) after flooding plates with
Lugol's iodine solution. TWEEN 80 esterase activity was
detected by formation of precipitate around colonies on
medium containing 1% w/v TWEEN 80 (BDH Laboratories). Gelatin liquefaction was tested by adding 12% w/v
gelatin (Sigma®, Type A; 300 Bloom) instead of agar to
CPS-T-SW (excluding starch); the solidified medium was
inoculated with a needle and incubated at room tempera-

ture. Casein hydrolysis was demonstrated by zones of
clearing around colonies on media to which 3 g l-1 of sterile skimmed milk (autoclaved separately at 110°C for 40
min) had been added. Cellulase activity was detected by a
zone of clearing around colonies after flooding plates containing 1% w/v low-viscosity carboxymethyl cellulose
(Sigma) with 1 g l-1 of Congo Red (Sigma). Ground chitin
(50 g) from crab carapaces was dissolved by stirring for
one hour in 2.5 l of 32% HCl. The solution was filtered
through a cloth before adding sufficient deionised water
(approximately 20 l) to precipitate the chitin. The precipitate was washed by centrifugation, until a neutral pH was
obtained. The prepared chitin (0.5 g l-1) was added to
CPS-T-SW (excluding starch) agar, and added as an overlay medium on top of standard CPS-T-SW, which was
inoculated and incubated at 30°C. Chitinase activity was
detected by a hydrolytic zone appearing as clear halos
around colonies. DNAse activity was detected by zones of
clearing around colonies growing on DNase Test Agar
(Merck) with added NaCl (19.4 g l-1) after flooding plates
with 1 M HCl.
Substrate utilization was tested in microtiter plates using
liquid SW medium and the following compounds as sole
carbon and energy source (final concentrations in brackets): (1) The poly- and disaccharides dextran, alginic acid,
laminarin (each at 2 g l-1), cellobiose, sucrose, maltose,
lactose, and trehalose (each at 5 mM), (2) the monosaccharides and their derivates glucose, fructose, galactose,
mannose, arabinose, ribose, xylose, rhamnose, N-acetylglucosamine, glucosamine, gluconic acid, sorbitol, mannitol (each at 10 mM) and meso-erythritol (20 mM), (3)
the alcohols glycerol (20 mM), methanol (20 mM), ethanol (20 mM), n-propanol (10 mM) and n-butanol (10
mM), (4) the fatty acids formate (20 mM), acetate (20
mM), propionate (10 mM) and butyrate (10 mM), (5) the
carboxylic acids lactate, pyruvate, malate, succinate, fumarate, citrate (each at 20 mM) and α-ketoglutarate (10
mM), (6) the 20 common amino acids glycine, alanine,
cysteine, proline, serine, threonine, valine (at 20 mM
each), arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, glutamine,
glutamic acid, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine,
methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine (at
10 mM each), (7) miscellaneous compounds: betaine (20
mM), benzoate (10 mM) and salicylate (10 mM), (8) the
complex substrates yeast extract, casamino acids and bactopeptone (each at 1 g l-1), and (9) the n-alkanes, ndodecane and n-hexadecane (1% v/v) as sole carbon and
energy source were tested in oxic SW medium in sealed
serum bottles. Growth was assessed visually after two
weeks incubation at 30°C.
The range for growth at different temperatures, salt concentrations and pH values was tested in liquid CPS-SW
medium in glass test tubes. The medium was amended

http://www.salinesystems.org/content/4/1/8

with yeast extract (1 g l-1), and, below pH 7.0, PIPES (10
mM) was used as a buffer instead of TRIS. The salt concentrations tested ranged from 0.1 to 30% w/v NaCl, with the
other major salts at a concentration of 0.5 mM. Growth
was measured by turbidity at 430 nm.
Anaerobic growth was tested in screw cap bottles using
liquid anoxic CPS-SW medium buffered with NaHCO3
(30 mM, autoclaved separately) replacing TRIS, Na2S (2
mM, autoclaved separately at 109°C) as reducing agent,
resazurin (0.25 mg l-1) as redox indicator, and filter-sterilized glucose (4.5 g l-1) replacing starch.
Cluster analysis
The results of the 106 phenotypic tests were coded for
numerical analysis in binary format and a similarity dendrogram was drawn using the XLSTAT™ software package
(version 2008.1.02; Addinsoft, Paris, France) using the
Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering (AHC) method,
calculated with the Jaccard coefficient and UPGA
(unweighted pair-group average) linkage.
Screening for different 16S rRNA phylotypes by Amplified
Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA)
Freshly grown colonies were suspended in 10 mM TRIS,
pH 8, centrifuged and washed. The cells were then lysed
by five freeze-thaw cycles (1 min in liquid nitrogen, followed by 5 min at 60°C). The lysate (0.5 – 1 μl) was used
directly in the PCR. The 16S rRNA genes were amplified in
a Gene Amp PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA) using 0.05 units·μl-1 final concentration of
TaqPol DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Crawley, UK). The
primers used were 27F (5'-AGA GTT TGA TCM TGG CTC
AG-3') and 1492R (5'-TAC GGY TAC CTT GTT ACG ACT
T-3') with an annealing temperature of 55°C. The PCR
product was purified with the QIAquick system (Qiagen,
Crawley, UK) and approximately 100 ng of the cleaned
product was digested for 2.5 h at 37°C with the restriction
enzymes Alu I (1 unit·μl-1 final concentration, Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The resulting DNA
fingerprints were analyzed after electrophoresis in a 3%
w/v agarose gel (1 h, 100 V, 100 base pair ladder as standard) using a digital image analyzer and the Quantity One
software package. One strain of each fingerprint-type was
selected for partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes, and
25 strains with different ARDRA profiles and related to
Bacillaceae were selected for phenotypic characterization.
16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis
Purified PCR products were subjected to sequence analysis using the ABI PRISM Big Dye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing kit version 2.0 and an ABI 310 automatic
sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
The primers used to obtain sequence fragments were 518R
(5'-CGT ATT ACC GCG GCT GCT GG-3'), 338R (5'-CTG

CTG CCT CCC GTA GGA GT-3'), 357F (5'-ACT CCT ACG
GGA GGC AGC AG-3'), 907R (5'-CCG TCA ATT CMT TTR
AGT TT-3'), 1389R (5'-ACG GGC GGT GTG TAC AAG-3').
Sequence fragments were checked using the Chromas
1.45 software package [54] and contigs assembled using
BioEdit 5.0.9 [55]. Assembled 16S rRNA sequences were
compared to the European Bioinformatics Institutes database by online FastA searches [56]. Multiple sequence
alignment of the isolates and their closest relatives was
performed using CLUSTAL W [57] and GeneDoc Multiple
Sequence Alignment Editor version 2.6.002 [58]. Phylogenies were constructed based on an alignment of approximately 1340 bp, with the PHYLIP software package [59],
using the Jukes and Cantor [60] model of nucleotide substitution, and the neighbour-joining algorithm. Significance of branching order was determined by bootstrap
analysis with 1000 resampled data sets. Sequences were
deposited in the EMBL databases with accession numbers
AM950291 to AM950315.
Determination of dipicolinic acid (DPA) and estimation of
endospore numbers
Numbers of endspores in sediment samples were estimated after extraction and analysis of dipicolinic acid
(DPA), an endospore-specific biomarker [28]. Extraction
and analysis were performed after Fichtel et al. [61]. In
brief, 1.0 g of freeze-dried sediment was weighed into
autoclavable 15-ml polypropylene tubes with screw caps.
Duplicates were prepared for each sample to determine
recovery: One of the sediment aliquots was suspended in
2.5 ml of sodium bisulfate buffer (50 mmol l-1, pH 1.2),
the other one was spiked by suspending in 2.5 ml of
buffer with 250 nmol DPA l-1. Both duplicates were autoclaved to completely release DPA from the endospores
within the sediment. After cooling, the samples were centrifuged (4000 g, 5 min, 15°C), and the supernatants were
filtered through cellulose acetate syringe filters (0.2 μm
pore size, Nalgene Nunc International, Rochester, NY)
into polypropylene vials. DPA concentrations were determined as Tb-dipicolinate complexes via HPLC with postcolumn complexation and fluorescence detection as
described by Fichtel et al. [61]. Endospore numbers were
estimated using an average cellular DPA content of 2.24 ×
10-16 mol per spore [28].
