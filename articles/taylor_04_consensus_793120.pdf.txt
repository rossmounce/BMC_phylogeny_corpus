virus capsid protein models threadingFv1MLV

Abstract
Background: The mouse Fv1 (friend virus) susceptibility gene inhibits the development of the
murine leukaemia virus (MLV) by interacting with its capsid (CA) protein. As no structures are
available for these proteins we have constructed molecular models based on distant sequence
similarity to other retroviral capsid proteins.
Results: Molecular models were constructed for the amino terminal domains of the probable
capsid-like structure for the mouse Fv1 gene product and the capsid protein of the MLV. The
models were based on sequence alignments with a variety of other retrovirus capsid proteins. As
the sequence similarity of these proteins with MLV and especially Fv1 is very distant, a threading
method was employed that incorporates predicted secondary structure and multiple sequence
information. The resulting models were compared with equivalent models constructed using the
sequences of the capsid proteins of known structure.
Conclusions: These comparisons suggested that the MLV model should be accurate in the core
but with significant uncertainty in the loop regions. The Fv1 model may have some additional errors
in the core packing of its helices but the resulting model gave some support to the hypothesis that
it adopts a capsid-like structure.

Background
The Fv1 gene is one of a series of mouse genes that control
the susceptibility of mice to murine leukaemia virus
(MLV) [1-3]. The gene acts in the cell to restrict virus replication [4] through a mechanism that is still uncertain.
Genetic studies suggest that the target for the Fv1 gene
product is the capsid protein (CA) of MLV [5,6] and it is
thought to interact with CA after entry of the virus into the
cell but before integration and formation of the provirus.

When cloned and sequenced [7], the Fv1 gene was found
to have sequence similarity to endogenous retroviruses of
the HERV-L and MuERV-L families [7,8]. Based on its
position within the Gag gene of these endogenous elements, it appears that Fv1 encodes a capsid-like protein.
This structural assignment of the Fv1 gene is consistent
with its function as it can be postulated that the gene
product might act as a dominant negative mutation and
interfere with the MLV capsid function [9]. Sequence

alignments have been made between Fv1 and other retroviral capsid proteins [8] but besides one region of clear
similarity, called the Major Homology Region (MHR),
there is otherwise little that is conserved across the full
family of retroviral (and related lenti-virus) CA sequences.
There are now several known structures for retroviral capsid proteins in the Protein Databank (PDB). While some
of these are only fragmentary, a selection can be extracted
that gives a reasonable phylogenetic spread across the retroviruses, with examples from three out of six genera of
orthoretroviruses. In all the known structures, the CA protein has an all-α type structure consisting of two domains:
a larger N-terminal and smaller C-terminal domain with a
short extended linker-region between them. As this linker
enters the C-terminal domain it incorporates the MHR.
There is considerable variation in the orientation of the
domains and in the conformation of the loop-regions
between α-helices, particularly in the N-terminal domain.
In this work, we have exploited these multiple structures
to construct consensus molecular models using threading
methods both for the Fv1 gene product (FV1) and its target protein, the MVL CA. As threading takes known and
predicted structure into account, it should provide better
alignments for the regions that lie outside the MHR. However, as these methods are still far from perfect, we have
constructed a model based on each known structure and
the degree to which these agree has been used to assess the
confidence of different parts of the model. As the threading method we have used has some 'free' parameters (such

as the gap-penalty) we have introduced a novel modelling
strategy in which the parameters are varied to give maximum agreement among the resulting models.

Results and Discussion
The sequence alignments compiled on the proteins of
known structure using the Ψ-BLAST/QUEST search strategy (Methods Sectn.) were used in the modelling of both
the MLV CA and FV1 sequences. These varied from 4 to 7
sequences (Table 1). Not unexpectedly, the alignments are
to some extent similar, in particular each contains the
sequence of the HIV-1 CA structure [1e6jP]. (QUEST is
biased to retain sequences of known structure). Greatest
overlap exists between the sequence sets of the two
human viruses, with the HTLV-I sequences being a subset
of the HIV-1 sequences (Table 0(d) and Table 0(c)). While
it would be possible to extend and realign these sub-families based on structure comparisons, they were left unaltered so as to be equivalent to the MLV and FV1
alignments described below. This allows control modelling tests to be directly comparable to those performed for
sequences of unknown structure.
MLV Modelling
The databank search using the MLV sequence as a probe
provided a useful collection of six sequences (Table 1(a))
which, with the MLV probe sequence itself, were passed
through the PsiPred secondary structure prediction protocol (Methods Sectn.). When the predicted secondary
structures were viewed on the aligned sequences, several
distinct α-helices were apparent, consistent with the pro-

tein having an all-α type structure similar to the other capsid proteins of known structure (Figure 1).
The MLV alignment with predicted secondary structure
was matched in the MST program with the four capsid
proteins of known structure along with their associated
aligned sequences. This was done for each parameter combination specified in Methods Sectn. and the quality of the
agreement among the four resulting models quantified
using both the Fu and Fw measures defined in Methods
Sectn. There was reasonable overall agreement between
the two measures of the parameter combinations (Figure
2) and with otherwise no basis on which to prefer one
measure over the other, the combined measure (Fv) was
used to select the parameters on which the final models
were calculated. These were S = 7, G = 30.
N-terminal domain
The multiple structure alignment of the four models
showed good agreement. In the N-terminal domain there
were two extensive regions over which all models were
aligned in register, covering helices N2-N3 and N5
(including the preceding short helix in the loop region).
Two alternate registers were observed for helices N1 and
N4, with relative shifts of 3 and 4 residues, respectively.
The models based on 1qrjA (HTLV-I) and 1d1dA (RSV)
were in complete agreement and the summed Fw score
indicated that 1d1dA provided the best consensus model.

Given that the alignment of the capsid protein sequences
is ambiguous, the superposition of the models on the
structures from which they were derived provides a better
way to assess whether there is any significant sequence
similarity that could be used as a basis on which any one
model might be preferred over the others. The PSId values
were: 5.6, 18.5, 10.5, 13.0 for 1d1dA, 1qrjA, 1eia and
1e6jP, respectively. (No differences were observed
whether using the standard version or the sequencebiased version of SAP).
Although the 1d1dA model was the best consensus representative, it has only 5.6% sequence similarity with MLV
and the higher sequence similarity of the 1qrjA based
model with its template (18.5%) was considered sufficient to justify its adoption as the preferred model over the
1d1dA model. Structurally, both were very similar (1.4 Å
wRMSd) with the only significant structural difference
being a slight reorientation of the helical region in the
loop preceeding the final helix. This structure for the
1qrjA based model is shown along with its comparison
with the 1d1dA model in Figure 3.
It can be seen from Figure 3(a) that there is good location
of the predicted and model helices with deviations occurring only at the ends of some helices and into the loop

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/4/1

regions at the 'top' of the molecule. The ends of helices N4
and N5 and the loops at this end of the molecule also
encompass the mutations identified as affecting the sensitivity of the virus to Fv1 [29].
C-terminal domain
With its relatively unambiguous MHR, all the models of
the C-terminal domain were in complete agreement over
the first half of the domain. The more C-terminal half,
however, was less consistent due to a combination of its
generally less conserved nature combined with uncertainty in the location of the terminus in some of the
sequences.

As the C-terminal domain has been shown to be less
important in determining the property of virus susceptibility, further effort was not expended to try and refine the
alignment at the carboxy terminus of the molecule, especially in the more difficult alignment of the FV1 sequence
described below.
FV1 Modelling
The databank search using the FV1 sequence as a probe
provided a less useful collection of only two distinct
sequences (Table 1(b)). Although other sequences were
found these were rejected by QUEST as being too similar
to those retained.

The FV1 alignment with predicted secondary structure was
matched to the four capsid proteins of known structure as
described above for each MST parameter combination
and agreement among the four models monitored using
the F scores (Methods Sectn.). These were 50.3 and
131.874 for Fu and Fw while the corresponding score
obtained for the MLV models were 78.7 and 188.0,
respectively. The greater variation among the FV1 models
was undoubtedly due to uncertainty in the placement of
the large 'unstructured' region. Nevertheless, there was
reasonable overall agreement between the two measures
and both found maximal model agreement when S = 9, G
= 20 (Figure 4).
When the predicted secondary structures were viewed on
the aligned sequences, although several distinct α-helices
were apparent, these had a less direct correspondence with
those expected for a capsid protein (Figure 5). In particular, there is little predicted α-structure for helix N4 and the
alignment around N5 is ambiguous. If the secondary
structure prediction were to be believed, this might indicate the introduction of a large insertion, or given that
there were less sequences on which to base the
predictions, it is possible that the predictions are not as
accurate as those obtained for the MLV sequences.

Consensus model for the MLV N-domain. (a) The model for the MLV CA N-domain based on 1qrjA shown as a α-carbon trace with predicted α-helices coloured red (some fragments of predicted β-structure are coloured green). The molecule
is in approximately the same orientation as in Figure 8(a) and residues identified by Stevens et al. (2003) are marked as small

Feint dashed lines connect identical residues. The wRMSd = 1.4 (uRMSd = 5.8) over 123 residues.

N-terminal domain
The multiple structure alignment of the four models
showed unexpectedly good agreement. As in the MLV
models, two regions were aligned in register over all the
models. These included most of helix N4 and the following loop region then, after only one shift, the full register
was regained for helix N5. The sum-of-F scores for each
model indicated that 1eia provided the best consensus,
followed by 1e6jP (to which it was most similar). The
PSId values were: 9.3, 7.8, 6.6, 15.9 for 1d1dA, 1qrjA, 1eia
and 1e6jP, respectively. As the 1e6jP model aligns better
on its target by almost 10 PSId, this was considered sufficient to justify its adoption as the preferred model over the
1eia based model. Both models are similar in the core
region (1.3 Å wRMSd) but with the significant differences
in the extensive loop regions at the 'top' of the molecules.
This structure for the 1e6jA based model is shown along
with its comparison with the 1eia model in Figure 6.

It can be seen from Figure 5 and Figure 6(a) that there is
reasonable location of the predicted and model helices
except for helix N4 which is almost completely unpredicted. Otherwise deviations occurred at the ends of helices and in the loop regions at the 'top' of the molecule.

Control Models
To help assess the accuracy of the models constructed
above, the protocols described in the Methods sections
were applied to each of the sequences of known structure.
For each protein, this results in four models based on the
other structures (and its own structure). Each of these
models, was then compared to the known structure using
the modified SAP program and the RMSd/PSId measures
reported in Table 3.

With few exceptions, the wRMSd/PSId values indicated
generally good models and by visual inspection, all had
the correct fold. The models based on their own structures
were almost identical to their templates with the exception of 1d1dA. When the uWRMSd values of the models
against the known structure are plotted against number of
residues ranked by local score (Figure 7) it can be seen that
for 1d1dA the error rises sharply after 85 positions. Visual
inspection revealed that this was due to a misaligned segment in the large loop region. The majority of models
exhibited a gradual increase in wRMSd with increased
error mounting as the loop regions were introduced. Two
models that ran markedly below this trend were those
based on 1eia and 1e6jP (22% identity), the two most

Two of these were derived from the 1qrj alignment based
models which had a distinctly lower weight on the structure component (S weight) in the MST alignment.

would be expected that the models constructed for the
MLV sequence would fall in the mid-range of the spread
in quality observed in Figure 7 – typically, a good core
model (3 Å RMS over 80 residues) with increasing divergence in the more variable loop regions. This is where the

Figure model uRMSd values
Control7
Control model uRMSd values. Each model was compared with its known structure and the local residue matches calculated by SAP were ranked. The uRMSd was calculated for increasingly larger sets of ranked residues and plotted against set
size. This means that the best fitted residues in each comparison are found to the left of the plot with increasing divergence
towards the right. Four models are plotted for each of four CA proteins of known structure: 1d1dA = red, 1qrjA = green, 1eia
= purple, 1e6jP = blue. The best models are those of sequences built on their own structure. Three of these remain low
throughout their length while one has poor loops and rises towards the right. Above these are two models for the most similar sequences of 1e6jP and 1eia built on each others structure (22% identity). Most models lie in the mid range with a few accumulating early errors due to shifts in the core regions.

While a similar confidence might be hoped for the FV1
model, given its overall lower sequence similarity to the
proteins of known structure and the less consistent nature
of its secondary structure prediction, it is more likely that
it will be of lesser quality – corresponding more to the
poorer models constructed among the control proteins
(Figure 7). Typically, this would include shifts in the core
helices (giving the characteristic immediate rise in the
traces in Figure 7) with further shifts in the loop regions.
Despite this, as with all of the control models, it is likely
that the core fold of the protein should remain unaltered.

The sequence of the Fv1 gene [7] was taken from
FV1_MOUSE (GI:3913713). The region corresponding to
the CA was identified as residues 100/120–340/360
where the inner numbers represent the probable core of
the protein. This range corresponds to the region of highest similarity to the MuERV-L sequence [8]. The leading
100 residues of the polyprotein may correspond with a
relic matrix protein. Perhaps because of this, there is no
obvious protease cleavage motif [11] to give any
indication of the true terminus. However, in other situations this has not always been an accurate guide [12].

This study has shown that reasonable models can be constructed for both the FV1 and its target MLV protein based
on other retroviral capsid proteins. Although this result
was suggested by the existence of the MHR in both
sequences, the fluid nature of retroviral genomes does not
necessarily constrain the preceding domain to remain
constant in structure or even remain at all. Despite only
weak sequence similarities in this region, the addition of
multiple sequences with predicted secondary structure has
allowed plausible models to be constructed.

Structural Data
The structures of capsid proteins were extracted from the
PDB [13] with the aid of the FSSP structure comparison
database [14]http://www.ebi.ac.uk/dali/fssp/fssp.html.
Of the six structures in the FSSP alignment, only four
extended over the full length of the two structural
domains. There were as follows, with their PDB code (and
chain delimiter, if any) shown in brackets: Rous Sarcoma
Virus (RSV) [1d1dA] [15], Human T-cell Leukemia Virus
(HTLV-I) [1qrjA] [16,17], Equine Infectious Anemia Virus
(EIAV) p26 [1eia] [18] and Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV-I) p24 [1e6jP] [19].

These models can now be used in the interpretation of
experimental studies on the mode of action of retroviral
susceptibility. As will be reported in more detail elsewhere
[29], a series of amino acids in CA affecting the CA – FV1
interaction have been identified in the loops at the 'top' of
the N-terminal domain (Figure 3). Based on the model,
they suggest a potential FV1 binding domain in the MLV
CA. Experiments are currently under way to test this prediction by crystallographic studies.
For many years, the Fv1 gene has been the only known
intracellular non-immune natural defense against a retroviral infection. Recently, two additional genes, Ref1 and
Lv1, with antiviral activity have been described in human
cells [30,31]. Phenotypically, they resemble Fv1 [32] but
the genes themselves remain to be characterised. Understanding the mechanism of Fv1 action will provide
insights into how natural defences to retroviral infection
might be deployed against HIV.

The common core of the N-terminal domains of these
proteins (in the numbering of the PDB structure) was
defined as: 1d1dA 15–148, 1qrjA 16–129, 1eia 16–145
and 1e6jP 16–146. These fragments will be distinguished
below as: 1d1dAn, 1qrjAn, 1eia-n and 1e6jPn and each
terminates 8 or 9 residues before the conserved glutamine
of the MHR. The N-terminal domain can be described as
having five α-helices (N1...N5) with a long 'disordered',
partly helical, loop between helices N4 and N5. For ease
of reference below, this region will be called the 'top' of
the molecule and its representation in the Figures will preserve this orientation.

Methods and Data

The C-terminal domains were defined as: 1d1dA 152–
224, 1qrjA 132–204, 1eia 149–220, 1e6jP 149–220 and
were distinguished by the suffix "c". The common core of
this domain consists of an extended strand leading into
the MHR region followed by four helices designated
C1...C4.

Data
Sequence Data
All sequences were extracted from (and searches were
made over) the non-redundant protein sequence databank (NRDB) at the National Centre for Biotechnology
Information (NCBI) as it was found on 28th of January
2003.

Despite their different sizes, both the N and the C
domains have the same fold, perhaps suggesting an
ancient gene duplication. This is most obvious in the HIV
structure [1e6jP] where the domains can be superposed
with 4.6 (2.0) unweighted (weighted) RMSd over 68
residues.

The sequence of the MLV used was the gag protein
AAD55051 (GI:5881091) [10] and a region was extracted
from residues 215–432, corresponding to the CA protein.

The similarity of sequence and structure over these
domains was calculated using the SAP structure comparison program [20] for each pair of like domains (Table 4).

The N-terminal domains have clearly related structures
(3–6 Å RMSd) but have no significant sequence similarity
(over 20%) except for the EIAV and HIV-1 structures. The
smaller C-terminal domain (which contains the MHR)
has greater overall sequence and structural similarity compared to the N-terminal domain (mostly over 20% with
2–3 Å RMSd) and over 40% for the EIAV/HIV-1 pair.
Sequence Databank Searches
Initially, each probe sequence was compared against the
sequence databank using the Ψ-BLAST program [21] with
a significance level set at 0.001 and 5 cycles of iteration.
When the probe is a retroviral sequence, the number of
hits found by Ψ-BLAST can be large (typically over 1000).
These were reduced to manageable numbers by the use of
the search program QUEST which is similar to Ψ-BLAST
but incorporates a multiple sequence alignment stage in
its iterations to exclude redundant sequences as well as
excluding poorly related or incomplete sequences [22].
The alignments produced by QUEST typically contain
between 6–12 sequences (including the probe
sequences), none of which have more than 60% sequence
identity (PSId) with each other.

The sequences retained by QUEST are selected on the
basis of associated biological information, with those
including useful annotation and structural data being
given preference over those with no annotation or keywords such as "hypothetical". The filters are part of the
MULTAL sequence alignment program [23] which are
fully described in Ref. [24].
Secondary Structure Prediction
The multiple alignments resulting from the Ψ-BLAST/
QUEST search protocol were passed to the program
PsiPred http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/, Version 2.3)
[25]. This program normally performs its own databank
searches using Ψ-BLAST to build-up an alignment. Given
the problems described above that arise when searching
with retroviral sequences, the PsiPred program was used

locally to search only a database consisting of the
sequences that had already been selected by QUEST.
Each sequence in the alignment was taken in turn and
used as a probe against this small local database. As the ΨBLAST parameters used by PsiPred were more restrictive
than those used in the full search (only 3 cycles) and there
are fewer sequences in the databank, each sequence may
only find those to which it is more closely related. This
introduces some variation into the predictions which provides a useful indication of the confidence of each predicted secondary structure element (SSE).
Multiple Sequence Threading
The alignment gathered on the probe sequence was then
aligned with a protein structure using the multiple
sequence threading MST program [26]. This program uses
multiple sequence and structural information to automatically construct an α-carbon molecular model for the
probe sequence with some limited remodelling in regions
of insertion and deletion.
Template Sequence Alignments
The MST program can incorporate multiple aligned
sequences along with both the probe sequence and the
template structure. The latter were gathered in an identical
manner to the probe sequence using the Ψ-BLAST/QUEST
search protocol described above. Each search against the
NRDB was started with the sequence of the protein of
known structure and the resulting multiple alignments
examined 'by-eye' in the light of the known secondary
structures. If any large insert had been made in a secondary structure element (SSE) then it was assessed whether
the gap could be shifted outside the SSE without significant loss of residue matches. Similarly, if a large insert
(more than 6 residues) was made by any sequence other
than the probe sequence (of known structure) then the
insert was reduced to six residues by removing the positions with most gaps.

Capsid protein domains
Capsid protein domains. The structures of the common core of the capsid proteins are shown using the RSV protein
[1d1dA] as a representative. (a) The N-terminal domain, coloured blue→red from amino→carboxy termini with the five major
helices represented by thickened lines. (b) The C-terminal domain, represented as in part (a) but with the MHR region marked
in white.

Parameter Choice
The MST program has parameters that allow different
weights to be attached to the matching contribution of the
sequences, their secondary structures, residue exposure
and the residue packing in the resulting model. There is
also a gap-penalty. The best values for these weights
depends on the number and degree of relatedness among
both the probe and the template sequences [26]. Rather
than vary all these parameters individually, the weights on
the structural components (secondary structure, exposure
and packing) were 'ganged' together into a single parameter reflecting the contribution of structural terms relative
to the sequence matching component. This gave two
parameters: S (for structure) and G (the gap-penalty).
Previously, the structural parameters had all been scaled
into the same range so a value of S = 3 corresponds to a
value of 3 for each individual weight. Although the gappenalty is correlated with S, it cannot be linked in the
same way without the risk of missing good alignments.

In the current application, there was more than one available template structure and advantage was taken of this by

constructing models based on all available templates and
choosing the MST parameters such that the agreement
among the models was greatest. The parameters were
varied over the ranges: S = 0→9 (in steps of one) and G =
10→90 (in steps of 10).
Measuring Model Agreement
Whatever the parameters for MST, all the models constructed from the same probe have an identical sequence.
These might therefore be compared using the α-carbon
RMSd based on a one-to-one (100 PSId) sequence equivalence. However, using this simple measure, a 'trivial' shift
in space in which, say, an α-helix shifts by one turn relative to another α-helix might result in a large RMSd
between what are, topologically, similar models. It is better to allow a local relative shift in sequence of four residues to restore the spatial equivalence at the expense of
residue identity.

To implement this trade-off between RMSd and PSId, the
models constructed for each parameter combination were
compared against each other using the program SAP

This program calculates both a weighted (Rw) and
unweghted (Ru) RMSd for the two structures being compared and reports the percentage sequence identity of the
alignment. The weighted RMSd down-weights regions of
weak similarity which are mainly loop regions that can
have large relative displacements. Despite its origins [27],
in its current implementation the SAP program http://
mathbio.nimr.mrc.ac.uk/ftp/wtaylor/sapid/ does not
include a sequence matching component and this was
restored (for sequence identity only) by doubling the
local residue pair score for identical residue types and otherwise halving all other residue match scores in the initial
score matrix.

superposed with the template structure from which it was
derived. As most of the sequence similarities considered
below lie in the 'twilight-zone', the latter option was only
used when one model was clearly better than the others.
For this, we choose the criterion that it had to be 10 PSId
points clear of its 'rivals'.

A score reflecting match quality (f) was calculated as: f =
M/(1+R), where M is the PSId measured over the positions
aligned by SAP and R is one of the RMSd measures. Identical structures would score 100. For a set of N models, a
sum was calculated over the (N2 - N)/2 pair combinations
giving an overall measure of agreement (F) among the set.
For a set of four models that align perfectly (100 PSId)
with 2 Å RMSd, the overall score obtained would be 200.
This score was calculated for both the wRMSd and uRMSd
values (giving Fw and Fu, respectively) and a combined
score (Fv) as the product of Fw and Fu.

HERV-L, Human Endogenous RetroVirus (L family);

While this procedure provides a general method for
choosing parameter values, in the current application to a
multi-domain protein it was not meaningful to calculate
the RMSd over the full atomic model (because of relative
domain movements). Instead, the agreement was calculated over the more distantly related N-terminal domain.

Selecting a consensus model
Although any model in the set could be taken as a representative, it is best to try and select one that, by some criteria, can be considered to be the most representative. To
do this, we compared each pair of models usuing the
structure comparison protocol described in the previous
section. This provides a pairwise alignment based on
structure, and even though each model has an identical
sequence, the structural alignment may not match-up
identical residues. The pairwise alignment were then combined into a multiple structure alignment [28] and as the
models all have an identical sequence, their relative shifts
can be seen easily. Rather than use a pure structure or
sequence based measure of similarity between the proteins, the score F was devised in the previous section
(Methods Sectn.) that combines both a sequence and a
structural component. This was used to find the model
with the greatest sum-of-scores to the others.
