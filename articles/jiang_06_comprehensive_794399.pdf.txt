Abstract
Background: Roots are an attractive system for genomic and post-genomic studies of NaCl
responses, due to their primary importance to agriculture, and because of their relative structural
and biochemical simplicity. Excellent genomic resources have been established for the study of
Arabidopsis roots, however, a comprehensive microarray analysis of the root transcriptome
following NaCl exposure is required to further understand plant responses to abiotic stress and
facilitate future, systems-based analyses of the underlying regulatory networks.
Results: We used microarrays of 70-mer oligonucleotide probes representing 23,686 Arabidopsis
genes to identify root transcripts that changed in relative abundance following 6 h, 24 h, or 48 h of
hydroponic exposure to 150 mM NaCl. Enrichment analysis identified groups of structurally or
functionally related genes whose members were statistically over-represented among up- or downregulated transcripts. Our results are consistent with generally observed stress response themes,
and highlight potentially important roles for underappreciated gene families, including: several
groups of transporters (e.g. MATE, LeOPT1-like); signalling molecules (e.g. PERK kinases, MLO-like
receptors), carbohydrate active enzymes (e.g. XTH18), transcription factors (e.g. members of ZIM,
WRKY, NAC), and other proteins (e.g. 4CL-like, COMT-like, LOB-Class 1). We verified the NaClinducible expression of selected transcription factors and other genes by qRT-PCR.
Conclusion: Micorarray profiling of NaCl-treated Arabidopsis roots revealed dynamic changes in
transcript abundance for at least 20% of the genome, including hundreds of transcription factors,
kinases/phosphatases, hormone-related genes, and effectors of homeostasis, all of which highlight
the complexity of this stress response. Our identification of these transcriptional responses, and
groups of evolutionarily related genes with either similar or divergent transcriptional responses to
stress, will facilitate mapping of regulatory networks and extend our ability to improve salt
tolerance in plants.

Background
Roots are the primary site of perception and injury for several types of water-limiting stress, including salinity and
drought. In many circumstances, it is the stress-sensitivity
of the root that limits the productivity of the entire plant

[1,2]. The physiological significance of roots is belied by
their relative structural simplicity as compared to other
plant organs: roots are largely lacking in some major metabolic pathways such as photosynthesis, and have a stereotypical morphology that is conserved across taxa and

throughout the life cycle of individuals. This combination
of physiological relevance and structural simplicity has
made roots obvious targets for functional genomic analyses. For example, detailed transcriptional profiles have
now been resolved to single cell types within roots, and
these are now being integrated into regulatory circuits and
networks
[3].
Salinity treatments of plants are also an attractive experimental system. High salinity (generally meaning NaCl
accumulation in soil) is estimated to reduce agricultural
productivity on more than 20% of the world's cultivated
land [4]. NaCl treatments are simple to apply in laboratory settings, and dosage and timing can be controlled
more precisely than with other major abiotic stresses such
as chilling, freezing, and dehydration. Accordingly, microarray-based analyses of the response of Arabidopsis to
NaCl have been published in at least nine reports. However, most of these studies have analyzed either cell cultures or whole plants, rather than specific tissues [5-10].
Of the previous studies that analyzed roots specifically,
none used microarray probe sets representing more than
8,100 of the originally predicted 25,498 genes in the Arabidopsis genome [11-14]. Although Affymetrix microarrays containing probes for at least 22,591 Arabidopsis
genes have been used to profile NaCl responses specifically in roots, these data were generously deposited to
public databases, but without detailed description or
analysis in the primary literature [15]. Thus, the absence
of available, comprehensive transcriptomic data describing the response of Arabidopsis roots to NaCl treatment,
in combination with the potential applications of these
data in molecular physiology and systems biology, motivated us to conduct the research we describe here.

Results and discussion
Whole-plant responses to salt treatment
We applied a salt-shock treatment to 21 dpi (days past
imbibition) Arabidopsis plants by supplementing their
hydroponic growth medium with 150 mM NaCl (Figure
1). This concentration of NaCl has been used in several
previous gene expression studies, since it induces a moderate stress response and is not acutely lethal [5,16].
Indeed, after application of 150 mM NaCl, we observed
visible signs of stress including loss of turgor. However,
even after 48 h of exposure to media supplemented with
150 mM NaCl, nearly all of the treated plants recovered
and resumed growth when transferred into NaCl-free
hydroponic medium (data not shown). Obviously, these
experimental conditions differ from those experienced by
soil-grown plants, especially field-grown crops, where
multiple stresses and nutrient limitations can occur simultaneously [17]. Nevertheless, we expect that many stress
response pathways will be conserved across treatments.
This assumption, along with the precise experimental

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/25

control afforded by laboratory hydroponics, justifies the
use of hydroponics as model system for salinity stress.
To further define the physiological state of the plants that
we subjected to transcriptional profiling, we monitored
the accumulation of two stress-inducible metabolites,
namely anthocyanin and proline [18]. Recent evidence
suggests that anthocyanins may mitigate photooxidative
injury by efficiently scavenging free radicals and reactive
oxygen species [19]. Anthocyanin concentrations
increased rapidly in leaves of stressed plants, with the
absorbance of diagnostic wavelengths increasing nearly
three-fold in the first 6 h after treatment (Figure 1). These
pigments continued to accumulate, with a five-fold
increase observed at 24 h after treatment. Interestingly,
the concentration of anthocyanin began to decrease after
24 h of stress, due perhaps to catabolism of the accumulated pigment and acclimation to the stress conditions,
resulting in levels of anthocyanin at 48 h post-stress that
were slightly lower than levels observed at 6 h. Proline
concentration increased rapidly in both the leaves and
roots of NaCl-stressed plants until at least 48 h following
NaCl treatment (Figure 1). We observed a 3-fold increase
in proline concentration in roots after 6 h, and an 18-fold
increase after 48 h. A similar pattern of increase, with
higher absolute concentrations of proline, was also
observed in shoots. The accumulation of these metabolites is an indication that these plants were actively
mounting a stress response at the time we subjected them
to transcriptional profiling.
General transcriptomic responses
To characterize the effect of NaCl treatment on gene
expression in Arabidopsis roots, we extracted RNA from
control and stressed root samples at 6 h, 24 h, and 48 h
following treatment, and analyzed these in paired, dyereversed hybridizations on spotted 70-mer oligonucleotide microarrays consisting of probes representing
23,686 unique genes identified by Arabidopsis Genome
Initiative (AGI) locus identifiers. The full data set has been
deposited in the ArrayExpress database as accession EMEXP-754 [20]. We identified probes for 7,217 unique
genes whose treated:untreated log2 expression ratio differed significantly from 0 at one or more time points
(please see Additional File 1), according to the Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) algorithm, with a
false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 5% [21]. Among
these statistically significant expression ratios, probes representing 2,433 unique genes showed a NaCl-induced
increase in transcript abundance of at least 2.0 fold at one
or more time points. Conversely, probes representing
2,774 unique genes showed a decrease in abundance of at
least 2.0 fold or more. Thus, transcript accumulation for at
least 10% of Arabidopsis genes was strongly (i.e. > 2.0
fold) induced by NaCl-treatment, and transcripts for at

least 12% of genes were equivalently repressed, in
response to NaCl-treatment. The proportion of NaClresponsive genes we observed is somewhat higher than
previously reported estimates based on cDNA microarrays, likely reflecting the higher specificity of the oligonucleotide-based arrays [8].
Validation of microarray results
We compared our results to publicly available microarray
data from the AtGenExpress project, which used Affymetrix ATH1 arrays to describe the transcriptome of hydroponically grown Arabidopsis roots exposed to a 150 mM
NaCl-shock for up to 24 h [15]. Qualitative trends in
expression ratios are highly conserved between these datasets (Additional File 1). Quantitatively, we observed a
Pearson correlation co-efficient of 0.77 (6 h) and 0.69 (24
h) when comparing the ATH1 expression values with our
signal-intensity filtered ratios. The transcriptomic
responses we describe here are therefore generally reproducible across platforms and between laboratories (see
Additional File 1 for a comparison to data from other previous reports). Moreover, probes for at least 3,277 genes
were deposited our spotted microarray that are not
present on the ATH1 array, of which 730 were significantly responsive to NaCl treatment (Additional File 1).
For example, the gene with the highest-fold induction
(mean ratio = 7.4 (log2)) in our analysis is transcription
factor bHLH092 (At5g43650), but this gene is not represented on the ATH1 array. Thus, although the Affymetrix
ATH1 array and the Operon 1.0 70-mer probe set are each
commonly described as "whole-genome", it is clear that
either platform alone is deficient in the detection of hundreds of potentially significant genes, although in combination, they provide a nearly complete representation of
the predicted transcriptome.

To provide further validation of our microarray data, we
performed quantitative RT-PCR analysis on specific transcripts, including the highly inducible bHLH092 (Table
1). We selected 15 genes representing different functional
categories, which according to our microarray analysis
increased, decreased, or remained essentially unchanged
in terms of transcript abundance following salt-shock. For
all of these genes, the expression ratios measured by qRTPCR and by microarray were highly correlated (r = 0.91,
0.92 and 0.88 for 6, 24 and 48 h treatment, respectively).
These results help to confirm the general accuracy of the
microarray data we present here. The functional significance of the NaCl-responsive genes we validated by qRTPCR is discussed in more detail below.
Classification of NaCl-responsive transcripts
We used the STEM (Short Time-series Expression Miner)
software package to summarize our filtered microarray
data, by clustering it into 16 distinct temporal expression

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/25

patterns (Figure 2) [22]. The algorithms implemented in
STEM are designed specifically for microarray experiments
that sample only a few time points, such as ours. STEM
accordingly minimizes the potential for over-fitting that
can occur when some other clustering methods are
applied to time course data, and also facilitates the identification of over-represented functional categories within
each cluster, as described below.
The predominant temporal expression patterns detected
by STEM analysis show that changes in transcript abundance can be detected within the first six hours following
treatment for the majority of the 5,463 NaCl-responsive
genes represented in the profiles (Figure 2.). At subsequent time points (i.e. 24 h, 48 h) the response generally
either continued along the same trajectory (Figure 2a,i),
or remained close to the level of induction or repression
observed at 6 h (Figure 2b,j). Another subgroup of genes
had a peak response at 6 h, which returned towards
untreated levels of transcript abundance either gradually
(Figure 2c,k), or more rapidly (Figure 2d,e,l,m). It is notable that a significant number of these genes show opposite
patterns of induction and repression at 6 h as compared
to 48 h (Figure 2d,l). Still other genes that were responsive
at 6 h showed a peak change in expression at 24 h (Figure
2f,n), or, surprisingly, a moderate dampening of the
response at 24 h, and a renewed intensity of response at
48 h (Figure 2g,o). Finally, in contrast to all of the patterns
discussed so far, which began with a marked response at 6
h, a limited but significant number of genes showed relatively little response until the 48 h time point (Figure
2h,p). Thus, although the majority of genes are responsive
by 6 h of treatment, dynamic patterns of gene expression
are also detected after 24 h and 48 h of treatment. These
observations indicate that different regulatory networks
and effectors are active at each of these different periods
following the perception of stress.
As an objective means of generalizing the biological functions represented by NaCl-responsive transcripts, we next
used STEM to identify categories of functionally and/or
structurally related genes that are enriched (i.e. statistically over-represented at FDR < 5%) in one or more of the
clusters described above. Preliminary analysis using Gene
Ontology consortium categories (data not shown) was
used to guide the selection of a detailed list of gene families and superfamilies from primary literature sources, as
well as from curated databases including KEGG (Kyoto
Encylcopedia of Genes and Genomes), AraCyc, and TAIR
(The Arabidopsis Information Resource) [23-25]. The list
of categories and corresponding genes can be found in
Additional File 2. Most broadly, the functional themes
represented by NaCl-responsive transcripts can be divided
into effectors and regulators. According to this analysis,
the most prominent effectors of the NaCl stress response

are genes involved in detoxification, transport, protein
turnover, energy metabolism, and production of osmoprotectants. The major classes of regulators detected are
signal transduction components, transcription factors,
and hormone related genes. Each of these broad themes
has been previously reported in association with abiotic
stress responses [26]. The analysis we present here highlights specific NaCl-responsive genes and groups of genes
within these categories. Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 show groups of
functionally and/or phylogenetically related genes that,
according to STEM analysis, were significantly over represented (FDR < 5%) in one or more STEM profile (Figure
2), as well as a limited number of other groups of genes
mentioned in the text, for comparison. The tables also
include the number of genes within each category that
were up- or down-regulated more than 2-fold, although
this 2-fold threshold is not a criterion per se in STEM analysis.
Osmoprotectants
Osmoprotectants including proline and trehalose, and
small hydrophilic proteins such as dehydrins help to
maintain hydration of cellular components during
osmotic stress [27]. Genes regulating levels of osmoprotectants are highly stress responsive and were among the
first stress-inducible transcripts reported in the literature
[28-31]. As expected, we observed induction of many of
these genes in our NaCl-treated tissues (Table 2). Two proline biosynthetic genes were induced (P5CR, At5g14800;
P5CS, At2g39800), consistent with the increase in proline
abundance we observed when this metabolite was assayed
directly (Figure 1). We also observed transcript-level

induction of a large proportion of genes in the trehalose
biosynthetic pathway including 7 of the 8 trehalose phosphatases detectable on our array, as well as some (but not
all) dehydrins (Table 2). Although trehalose has been
shown to act as an osmoprotectant in bacteria and fungi,
recent studies have suggested that this disaccharide acts as
a signalling molecule in plants, noting that its intracellular concentration is too low to be an effective osmoprotectant [32].
Reactive oxygen network
NaCl treatment, like many environmental stresses, generates reactive oxygen species (ROS)[33]. These ROS and the
products of their reactions with other cellular components (e.g. peroxidized lipids) are generally toxic. It is
therefore not surprising that plants have evolved large
gene families for detoxification of ROS and their by-products. At least 148 enzymes have been defined as part of the
ROS scavenging network of Arabidopsis [33]. However, of
the 75 ROS network genes with sufficient hybridization
signal intensity to be detected on our microarray, a majority of the responsive transcripts were down-regulated > 2fold by NaCl (Table 2). The predominance of non-responsive or down-regulated transcripts was evident within
almost every category of ROS-scavenging enzymes, except
for alternative oxidase, ferritin, and monodehydroascorbate reductase, in which all NaCl-responsive transcripts
were induced. The limited proportion of genes with NaClinducible transcripts within the ROS-scavenging network
points to a considerable amount of sub-functionalization
at the regulatory and catalytic levels, as well as roles for
these genes beyond detoxification of ROS [34]. A third

Groups of genes that are significantly enriched in at least one STEM profile at a FDR of < 5% are marked with an asterisk (*). The final column
details the frequency of assignment of individual genes to specific STEM profiles identified by corresponding letters in Figure 2. Functional categories
in this table are defined according to the following sources: proline and trehalose biosynthesis [23]; dehydrins [27]; ROS-network [33]; class III
peroxidases [25, 102], GSTs [25]; MATE transporters [38]; aquaporins [25, 103]; all other transporters [25, 37].

(At3g01190), for validation by qRT-PCR, and confirmed
that these were generally down-regulated by NaCl-treatment (Table 1). These observations are consistent with
functions for type III peroxidases in biological processes
that are largely distinct from ROS scavenging.
A large proportion of glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs)
were induced by NaCl treatment (Table 2). We note that
nearly all of the NaCl inducible GSTs are from the Tau
family of GSTs, highlighting a distinct role for this subclass of genes in oxidative stress responses, as has been
previously inferred from proteomic studies [36].

Transporters
The regulated transport of molecules across the plasma
and vacuolar membranes is a well characterized response
to abiotic stress [26]. Within the NaCl-responsive transcripts on our microarray, we observed enrichment of
transporters for water, sugars, cations, and other molecules (Table 2). The NaCl-responsive aquaporins and vacuolar-type ATPases detected on our microarray were
enriched almost exclusively in down-regulated transcripts.

Groups of genes that are significantly enriched in at least one STEM profile at a FDR of < 5% are marked with an asterisk (*). The final column details the frequency

tionalization within these groups of genes, as compared
to the ROS scavenging network described above. Among
the remaining antiporters, as well as sugar transporters,
ABC (ATP-binding cassette), and LeOPT1-like transporters and MATE-like (multi-antimicrobial extrusion) efflux
carriers, specific transcripts were induced and others were
repressed by NaCl-treatment (Table 2) [37,38]. Within the
MATE family in particular, the proportion of NaCl-inducible transcripts is relatively large, as transcripts representing approximately half of the 26 detectable genes were
induced > 2 fold by NaCl, while only one MATE gene was
equivalently repressed. One of these transcripts was
among those we selected for further confirmation by qRTPCR (Table 1). Both qRT-PCR and microarray analysis
showed an approximately 8-fold increase in transcript
abundance after 6 h of NaCl treatment, with further accumulation to a 32-fold increase by 48 h. The large proportion of induced genes within the MATE family, plus the
magnitude of their induction, suggests a previously underappreciated role for MATE-efflux carriers in the root
response to NaCl. Very little is known about this family of
carriers, although a previous meta-analysis of microarray
data identified some MATE transporters among a list of
stress-induced transporters [39].
Primary energy metabolism, carbohydrates and cell walls
Transcripts required for the main respiratory pathways of
glycolysis, the tricarboxylic (TCA) cycle, and the pentose
phosphate pathway (PPP) were generally non-responsive
or were down-regulated by NaCl treatment (Table 3).
Genes encoding components of the mitochondrial elec-

tron transport chain were especially enriched among
down-regulated profiles (Table 3). The down-regulation
of these energy-evolving pathways is a common stress
response that may serve to conserve energy and limit
growth and further generation of ROS [40]. The few glycolytic and TCA-related transcripts that were up-regulated
were all isoforms of other genes that had been down-regulated, although no correlation between cytoplasmic
location and NaCl-response could be detected (data not
shown). Transcript abundance for almost all components
of the PPP was also decreased (Table 3), including D-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase (At3g01850, At1g63290),
ribose 5-phosphate isomerase (At2g01290, At3g04790),
6-phosphogluconolactonase (At5g24410, At3g02360),
and glucose-6-phosphate-1-dehydrogenase (G6PDH)
(Additional File 1). The PPP is an important source of
NADPH, especially in non-photosynthetic tissues, and
therefore might be expected to have increased activity
under oxidative stress [41-43]. However, we noted that
the down-regulated G6PDH transcripts we detected were
G6PD5 (At3g27300) and G6PD6 (At5g40760), which are
the major, cytosolic versions of G6PDH expressed in Arabidopsis roots and are distinct from the four genes encoding plastid-localized isozymes [44]. Previous analyses of
G6PDH enzyme activity in potato and tobacco leaves has
shown that isozymes located in plastids, but not the
cytosol, have increased enzymatic activity following exposure to osmotic and oxidative stress [45,46]. Thus, G6PD5
and G6PD6 may function preferentially under conditions
other than osmotic and oxidative stress. The sub-functionalization of isozymes into groups with contrasting

responses to stress appears to be a common theme within
the PPP, TCA, and glycolysis-related genes detected on our
array.
Glycosyltransferases (GTs) and glycoside hydrolases
(GHs) are two large superfamilies of carbohydrate-active
enzymes [47]. All GTs catalyze similar biochemical reactions, namely the transfer of sugar moieties to acceptor
molecules. Conversely, GHs break bonds existing
between sugar moieties other molecules. Within each of
these superfamilies, a significant and roughly equivalent
number of genes were either up-regulated or down-regulated by NaCl at the transcript level, suggesting dynamic
regulation of glycosylation in response to stress. These
salinity responsive genes were distributed throughout the
many constituent gene families of GTs and GHs, such that
only two of the constituent families of GHs were significantly enriched in NaCl-responsive genes by our criteria:
GH16, and GH28 (Table 3.). One member of the GH16

family, XYLOGLUCAN ENDOTRANSGLUCOSYLASE/
HYDROLASE 18 (XTH18; At4g30280), was previously
reported to be expressed in the base of elongating roots,
and is among the NaCl-induced genes we selected for validation by qRT-PCR (Table 1) [48]. GH16 and GH28 are
comprised largely of xyloglucanases and galacturonases,
respectively, which are both often associated with cell wall
metabolism. A limited number of other cell-wall related
gene families were also enriched in NaCl-responsive transcripts, most notably the expansins (Table 3) [49], for
which at least one-third of the genes were transcriptionally up-regulated by NaCl. Increased activity of expansins
and xyloglucanases is consistent with the increase in cell
wall flexibility observed in response to osmotic stress in
some species [50].
A decrease in transcript abundance for many enzymes
involved in lignification, as well as the potentially cell
wall-related lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), were also

observed in our microarray data (Table 3). However, we
note that two families of enzymes that are sometimes
grouped in the "lignification tool box", namely the 4CL
(4-coumarate:CoA ligase)-like and the COMT (Caffeic
acid O-methyltransferase)-like families, were almost
entirely up-regulated in response to NaCl stress [51]. It is
should be emphasized that these two families do not
include their namesakes 4CL and COMT, which are
enzymes with clearly established roles in lignification.
Thus the 4CL-like and COMT-like genes may have unique
roles in the NaCl stress-response, and may not necessarily
be related to lignification. LTPs are another group of proteins, some of which have been shown to affect cell wall
extensibility or to be secreted in response to NaCl stress
[52,53]. Nearly half of the detectable LTP transcripts on
our microarray were down-regulated by NaCl treatment

(Table 3), although at least 5 LTPs were up-regulated. It is
likely that these various LTPs represent a diversity of stress
responses, some of which may also be related to cell-wall
extensibility.
Protein metabolism
The impact of abiotic stress on protein metabolism is evident in our microarray results. A decrease in bulk protein
translation following NaCl has been detected in proteomic studies, and is consistent with our observed downregulation of the majority of transcripts for almost all
cytosolic and plastidic ribosomal proteins (Table 4) [54].
Among proteins that promote the proper folding of proteins and/or prevent the aggregation of nascent or damaged proteins, we detected enrichment of NaClresponsive genes within several gene families. Within the

Groups of genes that are significantly enriched in at least one STEM profile at a FDR of < 5% are marked with an asterisk (*). The final column
details the frequency of assignment of individual genes to specific STEM profiles identified by corresponding letters in Figure 2. Functional categories
in this table are defined according to the Database of Arabidopsis Transcription Factors [81]. The following small transcription factor families, which
are each represented by probes for three or fewer genes on the microarray, are not listed in this table: ARID, BES1, C2C2-YABBY, CAMTA,
CCAAT-DR1, CPP, E2F/DPE2FC, EIL, FHA, GIF, GRF, HRT-like, LFY, LUG, MBF1, NZZ, PBF-2-like(Whirly), PcG, S1Fa-like, SAP, SRS, ULT, VOZ.

peptidyl prolyl isomerase super-family, the 29 genes represented by detectable transcripts were largely down-regulated by NaCl (Table 4) [55], although only the
cyclophilins were significantly (< 5% FDR) enriched in
down-regulated transcripts. A second superfamily of genes
related to protein folding and aggregation are the heat
shock proteins (HSPs) [56,57]. As expected, a majority of
the 51 detectable HSP superfamily genes were transcriptionally induced by NaCl, and transcripts for only 5 genes

were down-regulated by > 2 fold (Table 4). Although the
majority of HSPs are resident in the cytosol, most of the 5
down-regulated genes detected in the HSP superfamily
were targeted to specific compartments, including two
genes targeted to the endoplasmic-reticulum (ER)
(HSP70, At4g16660; HSP90-like SHEPERD, At4g24190),
a chloroplast targeted HSP100/CLP (At5g50780). Consistent with these observations, some HSP family proteins
that are targeted to chloroplasts or the ER have been pre-

viously shown to be repressed by particular abiotic
stresses [58].
Proteolytic activity has been attributed to over 600 peptidases within the plant genome, [59]. In our microarray
data, both up- and down-regulated transcripts were
detected for genes within each of the aspartic, cysteine,
serine, and metallo-peptidase super-families (Table 4).
Specific families and sub-families within the cysteine and
serine peptidases were significantly enriched in NaCl
responsive genes, as shown in Table 4. In contrast to the
other peptidase superfamilies, the responsive threonine
peptidases that comprise the 20S catalytic core of the 26S
proteasome were exclusively down-regulated. A predominance of down-regulation was also observed among the
transcripts comprising the other component of the 26S
proteasome, namely the 19S regulatory particle (Table 4).
However, many of the gene families putatively encoding
functions upstream of the 26S proteasome in the ubiquitination pathway were up-regulated. Notably, SKP1 (Sphase-associated kinase protein) kinases, E3 U-box proteins, and E3 RING (Really Interesting New Gene) finger
proteins were all significantly enriched in NaCl-induced
genes (Table 4). Because the 26S proteasome works in
conjunction with the ubiquitination pathway as the major
proteolytic system of the nucleus and cytosol, it appears
paradoxical that many ubiquitination-related proteins
would be up-regulated, while the detectable 26S proteasome transcripts would be uniformly down-regulated by
NaCl treatment [60]. This suggests a role for some SKP1,
E3 U-box proteins, and E3 RING related enzymes that is
independent of the 26S proteasome in the stress response,
and may also hint at aspects of regulatory complexity not
captured by microarray analysis [61].
Signal transduction components and hormones
The predicted kinases of Arabidopsis form a very large
superfamily of at least 979 genes that has been subdivided
into 5 classes comprised in total of 81 families [62,63].
Nearly all of the NaCl-responsive kinases on our microarray were associated with the two largest classes in the
PlantsP classification system (PPC:1, PPC:4) and twelve
families therein (Table 5). These include eight families of
receptor-like kinases (RLKs) and related kinases: legume
lectin domain (LLD), leucine rich receptor (LRR) II & X,
and LRR XI &XII, receptor like cytoplasmic kinase (RLCK)
VII, wall-associated kinase (WAK)-like, proline-rich
extensin-like kinases (PERK), S-Domain (type 1), and
domain of unknown function (DUF) 26. Within each of
these families, nearly all NaCl-responsive genes increased
in transcript abundance following stress-treatment, and
none of the detectable PERKs or S-Domain (type 1)
kinases was repressed by NaCl (Table 5). Aside from the
RLKs and related proteins in class PPC:1, we also detected
enrichment of NaCl-responsive transcripts within several

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/25

families of non-transmembrane kinases, including
Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase Kinase Kinases
(MAP3Ks), Calcium Responsive Kinases (CRKs), Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases (RPS6K), and an unnamed family (PPC:4.4.1) of kinases. Among these, up-regulated
transcripts were especially predominant in the RPS6K and
PPC:4.4.1 families.
Protein phosphatases are divided into three major classes:
Protein Serine/Threonine Phosphatases (STKs), Dual Specific Phosphatases (DSPs), and Protein Phosphatase 2C
(PP2C) [62]. We observed that the STKs and DSPs differed
greatly from the PP2Cs in their transcriptomic response to
NaCl-shock (Table 5). Transcripts for only one of the 18
detected STKs or DSPs were strongly induced by NaCl
treatment, whereas transcripts for more than half of the
detectable PP2Cs were strongly induced by NaCl. Some
PP2Cs have been previously identified as components of
the ABA signalling pathway, and all of these are among
the NaCl-induced PP2Cs detected on our array: ABI1
(ABA INSENSITIVE 1; At4g26080), ABI2 (At5g57050),
HAB1 (HOMOLOGY TO ABI1/ABI2; (At1g72770), HAB2
(At1g17550), and AHG3 (ABA-HYPERSENSITIVE
GERMINATION3, At3g11410) [64-67]. Our data indicate
that nearly twenty other PP2Cs, including those outside of
the ABI/HAB clade defined by Saez and colleagues, may
have important roles in NaCl stress signalling.
The Two-component signal transduction system, which
consists of histidine protein kinases (HKs), His-containing phosphotransfer proteins (HPs) and response regulators (RRs), is involved in plant hormone, stress, and light
signaling [68]. The Arabidopsis genome contains 54 genes
encoding putative HKs, HPs, RRs, and related proteins. In
our data, none of the 16 HKs were induced by salt, while
AHK1, a putative osmosensor [69], was down-regulated at
the 6 h time-point (see Additional File 1). However, the Atype RRs were significantly enriched among clusters of
NaCl-induced genes (Table 5). These include ARR5, ARR6,
and ARR7, which act as negative regulators to repress the
expression of the cytokinin-responsive genes [70], suggesting a potential link between NaCl stress and cytokinin
signalling.
A handful of other families of putative regulatory proteins
were statistically enriched among clusters of NaCl-responsive genes in our analysis. Transcripts for at least half of
the six MLO (mildew resistance locus o) proteins detected
on our microarray were induced by NaCl-treatment [71].
These are seven-transmembrane domain proteins with
features similar to G-protein coupled receptors, and some
members of this gene family have been reported to be abiotic stress responsive [72]. Finally, transcripts decreased
for at least 5 of the 8 14-3-3 genes detectable in our root
microarray, while no significant increase in transcript

BMC Plant Biology 2006, 6:25

abundance for any 14-3-3 protein genes was observed
[73].
Ethylene and jasmonic acid (JA) are hormones whose
activity has been previously correlated with environmental stress [16,74,75]. The rate-limiting step of ethylene
biosynthesis is the production of 1-aminocyclopropane1-carboxylic acid (ACC) by ACC synthase (ACS), which is
followed by the conversion of ACC to ethylene by ACC
oxidase (ACO) [76]. ACS and ACO are each encoded by
gene families. Four ACC synthase and one ACC oxidase
genes were significantly up-regulated by NaCl-treatment,
while another 3 ACO genes were down-regulated by salt.
Differential regulation of members of the ACO gene family indicates that although ACS is the key regulatory point
for ethylene biosynthesis, regulation of ACO expression
also has functional significance [76]. Ethylene signalling
transduction involves ethylene response factor (ERF)/ethylene response element binding protein (EREBP), which
have been shown to act as activators or repressors of additional downstream ethylene-responsive genes. JA and its
derivatives are also known to be involved in a wide range
of developmental processes, as well as stress and defence
responses [75]. At least 7 genes implicated in the biosynthesis of JA were induced by salt stress (Table 5), including
LIPOXYGENASE3 (LOX3, At1g17420), ALLENE OXIDE
CYCLASE (AOC1, At3g25760), AOC2 (At3g25780), and
ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE (AOS, At5g42650), indicating that biosynthesis of this hormone is also NaCl responsive.
Within the biosynthetic pathway for indole acetic acid
(IAA), which is an auxin, we detected up-regulation of two
genes in response to NaCl treatment: namely nitrilases
NIT1 (At3g44310) and NIT2 (At3g44300) (Table 5) [77].
Consistent with an increase in levels of bioactive auxin,
we also detected down-regulation of transcripts for
SUPERROOT2 (SUR2, At4g31500), an auxin conjugating
enzyme [78]. We confirmed the repression of SUR2 transcripts by qRT-PCR (Table 1). Furthermore, we noted that
of 4 putative auxin efflux carriers detectable after hybridization, transcripts for PIN1 (At1g73590), PIN3
(At1g70940), and PIN7 (At1g23080) were induced by our
NaCl treatment [37]. Part of the increased auxin activity
we infered from our microarray data may be directed
towards increased lateral root formation, which is an
auxin-regulated, and PIN requiring process that has been
previously described in NaCl-treated roots [16,79]. Lateral
root formation also involves genes from the LATERAL
ORGAN BOUNDARIES (LOB) family; consistent with this
requirement, we observed that the class I sub-group of this
family was exclusively enriched in up-regulated transcripts, with at least seven genes induced following NaCltreatment (Table 5)[80]. Thus, the initiation of lateral root
primordia is a NaCl-stress response that appears to be dis-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/25

tinctly represented within our microarray data, even
though the process involves only a small number of cells
within the entire root.
Transcription factors
The Arabidopsis genome has at least 1,819 predicted transcription factors (TFs), which have been classified into 56
families [81-83]. From the over 1,613 transcription factors
represented as probes on our microarray, transcripts for
734 genes could be detected at a signal intensity above
background. Of these, 289 predicted TFs were up-regulated and 139 transcription factors were down-regulated
at least 2 fold at one or more time points following NaCl
treatment (Table 6). STEM analysis identified 17 families
that were significantly enriched among clusters of NaCl
responsive genes. These TF families range in size from 203
to 7 members, and are described below. Although these
17 families contain almost two-thirds of the predicted TFs
in the Arabidopsis genome, it is worth noting that transcripts for several other relatively large TF families were
detected on the array, but these were largely unresponsive
to NaCl stress. Some of the notable TF families that were
expressed in roots, but which were not significantly
enriched in NaCl-responsive transcripts are: MADS
(MCM-1, Agamous, Deficiens and Serum Response Factor), ARF (Auxin Response Factor), Nin-like (nodule
inception), and TUB (Tubby).

At least four TF families have been reported to be enriched
in stress-responsive genes: MYB (Myeloblastosis), HSF
(Heat Shock Factor), AP2/EREBP (Apetala-2/EREBP), and
WRKY (named after the WRKY amino acid motif). A
recent analysis of MYB-transcription factor gene expression concluded that almost all MYB TFs are responsive to
stresses or hormones [84]. Consistent with this report, we
observed that at least one third of the 84 detectable MYB
TFs were induced by NaCl at the transcript abundance
level, and only a small fraction were repressed (Table 6).
MYB15 (At3g23250), which is a R2R3-type MYB gene,
was induced approximately 16-fold by NaCl at each of the
three time points [85], and we confirmed this by qRT-PCR
(Table 1). Similarly, most of the HSF TFs detected on our
array were up-regulated by NaCl, as expected for this family of stress-inducible TFs [86](Table 6). The AP2/EREBP
family includes some of the best characterized stressresponsive transcription factors, including the CBF (CRT/
DRE binding factors) proteins [87,88]. We observed
NaCl-inducible transcript accumulation in more than half
of the 76 AP2/EREBP TFs detectable on our array (Table
6); and these up-regulated transcripts were detected in
each of the AP2/EREBP family's subgroups (i.e. AP2, RAV,
ERF I-X) [89]. We arbitrarily selected one AP2/EREBP TF
(At1g44830, TINY-related) for confirmation by qRT-PCR.
As shown in Table 1, both microarray and qRT-PCR analyses were in agreement about the strong inducibility of

BMC Plant Biology 2006, 6:25

transcripts of At1g44830 following NaCl-treatment. The
majority of WRKY family TF genes are known to be
responsive to biotic and/or abiotic stress, although most
research has focused on the role of these genes in pathogen responses [8,90-92]. We observed that transcripts for
18 of the 35 WRKY TFs detected increased by at least 1.5
fold in response to NaCl treatment. We used qRT-PCR to
confirm these observations for WRKY17 (At2g24570),
WRKY25 (At2g30250) and WRKY33 (At2g38470), which
are three of the least studied members of this family. Both
microarray and qRT-PCR confirmed that WRKY17 and
WRKY33 transcripts increased at least 14-fold following
NaCl treatment, although WRKY17 transcript abundance
peaked at 6 h and gradually diminished, whereas
WRKY33 abundance remained very high throughout the
time points sampled. The transcript level of WRKY25 also
increased and peaked at 48 h with an induction of at least
22 fold. These observations emphasize a potentially
important role for WRKY transcription factors in abiotic
stress responses.
Many TFs contain zinc-finger motifs including all members of the following families: C2H2 (Cys2- His2), C2C2
(Cys2- His2), C3H (Cys3- His) LIM (Lin-11, Isl-1 and
Mec-3), PHD (Plant Homeodomain), WRKY, ZF-HD
(zinc finger homeodomain), and ZIM (Zinc-finger protein expressed in Inflorescence Meristem). Of these, we
observed the WRKY (as described above), and C2C2,
C2H2, and ZIM families were particularly enriched in
NaCl-responsive transcripts. The C2C2 and C2H2 families are relatively large, and had significant numbers both
of up-regulated and down-regulated genes. The smaller
ZIM family was represented by 10 genes with detectable
transcripts in our analysis; 8 of these genes were up-regulated by NaCl treatment. Knowledge about the biological
role of ZIM TFs is very limited. Previous studies have
shown a putative relationship of some ZIM family members with GA-independent cell elongation in shoot tissues
[93,94]. The large proportion of ZIM family members
with NaCl-inducible transcripts makes this group of TFs
another attractive target for further functional characterization. We assayed the expression pattern of one ZIM
transcription factor (At3g17860) by qRT-PCR and confirmed that it is induced after 6 h of NaCl, although the
transcript abundance falls off rapidly after 24 h and 48 h
(Table 1).
Four other large families of TFs, each with distinct DNA
binding motifs, are: bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix), bZIP
(basic leucine zipper), NAC (NAM, ATAF1,2, CUC2), and
HB (homeobox) genes. All of these families contained
NaCl-induced genes, although only the HB and NAC families were significantly enriched in NaCl-responsive transcripts. We selected one bHLH TF (bHLH092, At5g43650)
and one NAC TF (At4g01550) for further confirmation by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/25

qRT-PCR. The NAC domain TF was chosen because its
expression peaked at later time points than most TFs;
bHLH092 was selected because it was among the mostly
highly induced transcripts of any gene on our microarray.
Furthermore, this bHLH is not represented among probes
on Affymetrix arrays, and therefore would not be detected
in some previous transcriptomic studies, although it was
among the NaCl-inducible transcripts identified in a longoligomer microarray analysis of whole Arabidopsis plants
[9]. Our qRT-PCR analysis showed a NaCl-dependent
increase of up to 50-fold for the NAC TF (At4g01550)
transcripts, and an increase for bHLH092 of over several
magnitudes (Table 1). Clearly, these two TFs, and many of
the other NaCl-responsive TFs shown in Table 6 are
potentially important regulators of the NaCl-stress
response in Arabidopsis roots.
An interesting property of the groups of transcription factors described in Table 6 is that the majority of the families (34/39) contain members that are assigned to
different expression profiles. In many cases, related transcription factors show very divergent expression patterns,
with some members of a single gene family induced early
in the stress response, while other members are induced
only at subsequent time points. For example, while the
majority of AP2/ERF family members have a peak relative
expression ratio at 6 h (Table 6, and Figure 2, STEM profile
b), some AP2/ERF transcripts had peak expression ratios
at 24 h (profile f), or increased in abundance throughout
the experiment until at least 48 h (profile a), while other
genes did not show a significant relative change in expression until 48 h (profile h), or showed a more complex pattern of regulation (profiles c, d, e), or were predominantly
down-regulated (profiles i, j, k, l, o). Similarly divergent
patterns of transcriptional responses have been described
previously within families of oxidative stress inducible
genes [95]. The large number of up- or down-regulated
transcription factor genes we detected, as well as the diversity of their temporal expression patterns, is consistent
with the existence of a highly complex regulatory network
underlying the physiological response to NaCl treatment.

Conclusion
Our observations of the transcriptomic response to NaCltreatment in Arabidopsis roots were consistent with the
broad themes of abiotic stress responses previously
reported in other systems [26]. However, our functional
enrichment analysis showed that a considerable amount
of sub-functionalization has occurred within many gene
families, demonstrating the complex relationship
between stress and processes related to reactive oxygen
species, cell wall growth, transport, signal transduction,
hormone signalling, proteolysis and transcriptional regulation. Moreover, STEM enrichment analysis allowed us to
detect previously underappreciated families within these

broad categories that are strongly associated with stress
response, including MATE transporters, LeOPT1-like
transporters. PERK kinases, MLO-like receptors, carbohydrate active enzymes (e.g. XTH18), transcription factors,
and other proteins (e.g. 4CL-like, COMT-like, LOB-Class
1), and verified the expression of a selection of these genes
by qRT-PCR. These data will facilitate the mapping of root
regulatory networks and better understanding of stress
phenomena in plants.

Methods
Plant growth and stress treatment
We sowed surface-sterilized seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana
(ecotype Col-0) on (3.5 mm diameter) agar plugs arrayed
on custom-made polypropylene rafts, and cold stratified
them at 4°C for 2d. Each plug consisted of 1/2 ×
Murashige and Skoog (MS, Sigma) basal salts, 1% sucrose,
and 0.7% phytagar, and each raft held approximately 30
seeds, spaced ca. 15 mm apart. Rafts were transferred into
opaque plastic tanks containing 1 L of autoclaved 1/4 ×
MS solution (pH5.7) in a growth chamber at 22°C, 70%
relative humidity, and light (125 μMm-2 s-1) on a 16 h
light/8 h dark cycle. The solution in the tanks was aerated
and replaced with fresh, autoclaved 1/4 × MS solution
every 4 days to limit growth of microorganisms. At 18
days post-germination (dpg), seedlings were treated with
1/2 × MS medium (pH5.7) supplemented with 150 mM
NaCl beginning at 8:30 AM (1.5 h after the start of the
light cycle), and roots were harvested at 6 h, 24 h and 48
h post-treatment, and were frozen in liquid nitrogen and
held at -80°C. Untreated controls were harvested in parallel, at the same time points. Approximately 150 plants
were harvested and pooled for each combination of time
point and treatment, in each biological replicate. This
process was repeated in three biologically and temporally
independent replicates.
Physiological analyses
Proline concentrations were measured using the method
of Bates [96], with L-proline (Sigma) as a standard.
Anthocyanin concentrations were determined according
to Macinelli and Schwartz [97]. For the root elongation
assays, 5 dpg seedlings grown on solid growth medium
(1/2 × MS, 2% sucrose, 0.7 % phytagar) were transferred
to square petri dishes containing similar growth medium
supplemented with 150 mM NaCl. Root elongation was
measured 5 days after transfer.
Microarray preparation, hybridization and data
extraction
We deposited 26,090 70 mer oligonucleotide probes
(Array-Ready Oligo Set for Arabidopsis genome Version
1.0 was from Qiagen Operon), plus additional probes for
quality control on superamine aminosilane-coated slides

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/6/25

(Telechem). Probe spotting followed previously described
methods [98,99]
Total RNA was isolated from both control and stressed
root tissue by RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen), and was concentrated by Microcon YM-30 (Millipore) to be ~1.2 μg/μL
and quantified by NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer. RNA integrity was checked on a formamide denaturing agarose gel. 5 μg total RNA was used to synthesize
cDNAs using SuperscriptII (Invitrogen) with RT polyAcapture primers in 3D Array900 kit (Genisphere). A twostep hybridization was performed, i.e., cDNA from both
control and treated tissue were hybridized together at
55°C overnight under a 24 × 60 mm cover slip (Fisher Scientific) in a sealed humid 50 ml centrifuge tube. Secondary hybridization with Cy3 and Cy5 dendrimers were
performed at 55°C for 4 h and washes were done according to the manufacture's protocol. Slides were scanned
immediately using ArrayWorxe (Applied Precision) and
transformed into tiff images. To avoid bias in the microarray evaluation as a consequence of dye-related differences
in labelling efficiency and/or differences in recording fluorescence signals, dye labelling for each paired sample
(stressed/control) was reversed in two individual hybridizations. Therefore, two hybridizations were performed for
each of three independent biological replicates at each
time point.
Microarray data analysis
Background-subtracted spot intensities were measured by
Spotfinder v3.0, and normalized by the Loess method in
MIDAS v2.19 [100]. Spots were defined as detectable
above background if their signal intensity in at least on
channel was greater than two standard-deviations above
the mean signal intensities of all blank and randomized
negative control spots, and if they were detectable in at
least two-thirds of arrays at any one time point. Fold
changes (treated/control) were calculated in log2 scale,
and significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) was
applied to find genes for which the fold change differed
significantly from zero in a multiclass test (with inferred
values at time point 0), using a false discovery rate (FDR)
of ≤5% [21]. Assignment of genes to temporal expression
profiles and detection of statistically enriched gene families within each profile was conducted using STEM (Short
Time Series Expression Miner) software, with maximum
number of model profiles set to 16, and maximum unit
change set to 3 [22]. The input data for STEM analysis consisted of all normalized, intensity-filtered data points
identified by SAM analysis as statistically distinct from 0.
The p-values derived from STEM analysis were corrected
for multiple hypothesis testing using a FDR of < 5% [101].
The raw microarray data of 18 hybridizations as well the
protocols used to produce the data were deposited in the

Real-Time quantitative PCR
Aliquots of the same RNA samples used for microarray
analysis were also used for real-time PCR. Reverse transcription (RT) was performed with 2 μg of total RNA pretreated with DNase I (Ambion) to obtain cDNA with
SuperScript II and Oligo(dT)12–18 (Invitrogen) as the
primer in a 20 μL reaction volume. Each cDNA sample
was diluted 1:4 in sterile ddH2O, and 1 μL of this dilution
was used as template for qPCR. Primers for the PCR reactions were designed by PrimerSelect 5.00 of DNAStar
(DNASTAR Inc) to have a Tm of ~ 60°C and an optimal
annealing temperature of 53–55°C with the length of the
amplicons between 80 and 200 bp. Real-time PCR was
performed with QuantiTech PCR SYBR Green I Kit (Qiagen) in 20 μL reactions using the LightCycler 1.5 System
(Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's
instruction. Each PCR reaction contains 1 μL of cDNA, 0.5
μM of each of the primers and 10 μL of master mix. The
initial denaturing time was 15 min at 95°C, followed by
35 cycles consisting of 94°C for 15 s, 53°C for 30 s, and
72°C for 20 s with a single fluorescence measurement. A
melting curve (65°C–95°C with a heating rate of 0.05°C
s-1 and a continuous fluorescence measurement) was run
after the PCR cycles followed by a cooling step at 40°C.

For relative quantification, amplification efficiencies (E)
for each gene were determined as follows: a portion of
cDNAs transcribed from 5 μg of total root RNA was
diluted with sterile ddH2O to be 10-1, 10-2, and 10-3.
Standard curves for each gene was performed using the
original and diluted cDNAs to cover the range of all template concentrations. Real-time PCR efficiencies (E) were
calculated from the given slopes in the LightCycler software of the standard curves according to the equation: E =
10 -1/slope. Crossing points, defined as the point at which
the fluorescence rises above the background fluorescence
was determined using the "Fit Point Method" in the LightCycler software 3.5.3 (Roche Diagnostics). Gene-specific
PCR efficiency was used to calculate the expression of target genes relative to the expression of UBQ10 reference
gene.

Microarray expression ratios for all probes significantly responsive to
NaCl, and comparisons to previously published data. Probes are shown
which, after one or more of the three time points following 150 mM NaCl
treatment, (i.e. 6 h, 24 h, or 48 h), had a fold change in expression ratio
(treated:control) that different significantly from 0 (log2), according to
SAM analysis (FDR < 5%) [21]. All probes were also filtered to remove
those with low signal in both channels of more than 1/3 of the arrays at
each time point, as described in Methods. Blank cells indicate that data
has been removed due to filtering. Only probes with associated AGI identifiers are shown, and some AGI loci are represented by more than one
probe. The expression ratios (log2, treated:control) for each of 18 hybridizations (3 biological replicates by 2 dye-reversal replicates at each of the
3 time points) are shown in columns 5–22, and can be distinguished by
the column headers. The mean expression ratio at each time point is given
in log2 scale in columns 23–25. Rows are sorted in decreasing order,
according to the mean of all expression ratios in each row as shown in column 26. Microarray expression data was extracted from selected previous
publications, and is summarized in columns 27–39, wherever genes common AGI numbers could be identified. All quantitative data is expressed
as (log2, treated:control) expression ratios. Columns 27–28 show expression ratios for all transcripts present on Affymetrix ATH1 arrays hybridized to 150 mM NaCl treated roots (6 h, 24 h), as described in the
unpublished AtGenExpress data set prepared by the Kudla group [15].
Columns 29–30 show expression ratios only for up-regulated genes identified in NaCl treated roots (3 h, 27 h) measured on the 8,100 gene
Affymetrix GeneChip, as described in Supplemental Table 1 of data prepared by Kreps and colleagues [12]. Column 31 shows expression ratios
for genes identified as being up-regulated in roots after 2 h of 250 mM
NaCl treatment, as reported in Table 2 of a report by Taji et al. [10].
These, as well as other relevant reports that lacked quantitative data are
summarized qualitatively in Columns 32–39. Wherever our present, spotted microarray data and the Kudla AtGenExpress data showed similar
patterns of expression for a given gene (i.e. up- or down-regulated by 2 or
more fold in both data sets at a specific time point), this is indicated by
the symbol 'Y' in the appropriate row of columns 32 or 33. Columns 34–
39 contain the symbol 'Y' if the gene in that row was included in the lists
of up-regulated genes reported in the following sources: Kreps et al. [12]
(roots, 150 mM; 3 h, Column 34; 27 h, Column 35), Taji et al. [10]
(roots, 250 mM, 2 h, Column 36), Maathuis et al. [13] (transporters
only, unspecified tissues and NaCl concentration, Column 37), Kamei et
al. [9] (Tables 1, 3, 5 of original report, genes up-regulated after 2 h or
5 h 250 mM treatment of sos2 or sos3 mutants, Column 38), Ma et al.
[5] (Table 2 of original report, root-specific NaCl induced gene expression, Column 39).
