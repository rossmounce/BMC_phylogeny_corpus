Development of infectious cDNA clones of
Salmonid alphavirus subtype 3
Marius Karlsen1*, Stephane Villoing2, Karl F Ottem1, Espen Rimstad3, Are Nylund1

Abstract
Background: Salmonid alphavirus (SAV) is a widespread pathogen in European aquaculture of salmonid fish.
Distinct viral subtypes have been suggested based on sequence comparisons and some of these have different
geographical distributions. In Norway, only SAV subtype 3 have so far been identified. Little is known about viral
mechanisms important for pathogenesis and transmission. Tools for detailed exploration of SAV genomes are
therefore needed.
Results: Infectious cDNA clones in which a genome of subtype 3 SAV is under the control of a CMV promoter
were constructed. The clones were designed to express proteins that are putatively identical to those previously
reported for the SAVH20/03 strain. A polyclonal antiserum was raised against a part of the E2 glycoprotein in order
to detect expression of the subgenomic open reading frame (ORF) encoding structural viral proteins. Transfection
of the cDNA clone revealed the expression of the E2 protein by IFAT, and in serial passages of the supernatant the
presence of infectious recombinant virus was confirmed through RT-PCR, IFAT and the development of a
cytopathic effect similar to that seen during infection with wild type SAV. Confirmation that the recovered virus
originated from the infectious plasmid was done by sequence identification of an introduced genetic tag. The
recombinant virus was infectious also when an additional ORF encoding an EGFP reporter gene under the control
of a second subgenomic alphavirus promoter was added. Finally, we used the system to study the effect of
selected point mutations on infectivity in Chinook salmon embryo cells. While introduced mutations in nsP2197,
nsP3263 and nsP3323 severely reduced infectivity, a serine to proline mutation in E2206 appeared to enhance the
virus titer production.
Conclusion: We have constructed infectious clones for SAV based on a subtype 3 genome. The clones may serve
as a platform for further functional studies.

Background
The genus Alphavirus (Family Togaviridae) consists of
viruses with positive sense, single stranded, capped and
polyadenylated RNA genomes [1]. Of the 29 recognized
species in the genus, 28 are pathogens of higher vertebrates in the terrestrial environment, and the transmission cycle of these viruses includes an arthropode
vector. The only species of the genus that infects fish,
Salmon pancreas disease virus, today more commonly
designated Salmonid alphavirus (SAV), is genetically distinct and a pathogen of farmed salmonids in Europe
[2-4]. The genome of SAV is 11.9 kb long and has a

genomic structure homologous to terrestrial alphaviruses with two large open reading frames (ORFs) of 8
and 4 kb length that are flanked by three untranslated
regions (UTRs). The first ORF encodes non-structural
proteins 1-4 (nsP1-4) and the second one encodes the
structural proteins capsid, E3, E2, 6K, TF and E1 [5,6],
of which capsid, E2 and E1 have been demonstrated to
be expressed during replication [7,8]. The nsPs, possibly
together with host proteins, make up the replicase complex (RC) that replicates the viral genome and transcribes the second ORF [9,10]. The structural proteins
are translated from the subgenomic mRNA of the second ORF, that is controlled by a SAV RC specific promoter [2,3,10]. Following its translation in the
cytoplasm, the capsid protein cleaves itself from the
adjacent structural proteins. Studies from terrestrial

alphaviruses have demonstrated that the cleaved capsid
interacts with viral genomic RNA to form nucleocapsids
[1]. It has also been suggested to have additional nonstructural functions as the capsid of several alphaviruses,
including SAV, may localize to the nucleus during infection [8,11-15]. The remaining structural proteins are
translated into the membrane of the endoplasmatic reticulum, where they undergo glycosylation and proteolytic
cleavage, before they are transported to the cell membrane. Budding of viral particles is induced by interactions between the capsid protein and the cytosolic parts
of viral glycoproteins [16]. The glycoproteins are functional in the recognition and binding to receptors on
the cell surface (E2), and fusion of the viral membrane
with the host cellular membrane (E1) [1]. It is likely that
SAV uses the same route of budding, entry and glycoprotein maturation, based on homology in sequence
motifs between alphaviruses and the observed intracellular localization of the glycoproteins during infection
[2,3,7].
The SAV replication cycle can be reproduced and
modified using reverse genetics systems [10]. In these
systems the complete or partial viral genome is cloned
as cDNA where a promoter for RNA transcription controls the expression. Such systems may be designed as
replicons, where the viral structural ORF is replaced
with a gene of interest (GOI). Alternatively, the structural ORF is intact and addition of a second alphaviral
promoter controls expression of the GOI. Expression of
the GOI will then follow the same kinetics as the viral
structural proteins.
Sequence analyses of SAV strains have suggested that
at least six genetically distinct subtypes of the virus,
SAV1-6, have evolved [17]. Some of the observed
sequence differences also lead to variations in antigenic
epitopes [5]. Of these subtypes, SAV1, 2 and 3 are the
best studied, and full-length genomes of strains belonging to these subtypes have been sequenced [5,9,18].
Strains grouping to subtype 1 have primarily been associated with disease in the marine production phase of
Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in Ireland, those grouping
to subtype 2 with disease in Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in the freshwater phase in continental
Europe and UK, and recently reported from marine
Atlantic salmon in Scotland, and subtype 3 strains with
disease in Atlantic salmon and Rainbow trout in the
marine production phase in Norway [17-19]. Experimental infection trials have demonstrated that strains
belonging to the different subtypes cause similar clinical
signs and pathologies in the target species [4]. With the
exception of SAV2 infections in rainbow trout fingerlings [10], the mortality rates observed in laboratory
experimental transmission of SAV are typically low, if
any mortality at all [5,20-22]. Higher mortalities have

Page 2 of 13

sometimes been reported from field outbreaks [23,24].
Although these variations in mortality could be
explained by differences in virulence between viral
strains, the contribution from factors other than SAV,
such as fish strain, environmental variations and other
pathogens, could be equally important. Different transmission routes of SAV have been suggested to be of
importance in aquaculture [17,25-28], but transmission
mechanisms remain poorly understood. In Norway, SAV
appears to be genetically homogenous, suggesting one
or few original common sources for all outbreaks [25].
After an outbreak, SAV may remain in the fish population in the form of a possibly lifelong, persistent infection in some individuals [20,29,30]. Information about
viral and host mechanisms that regulate the persistency
is not available, but could be useful for proper management of infected fish populations.
Although viral factors that contribute to the different
outcomes of a SAV infection remain largely unresolved,
we previously hypothesised based on sequence analyses
that a mutation in E2, the viral receptor protein, could
be of importance for pathogenicity [25]. In general, outbreaks of several alphaviral epidemics have been associated with such point-mutations in E2 and E1 [31,32].
Recently, studies of the epidemic caused by the alphavirus Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), have demonstrated
how reverse genetics systems can be powerful tools for
understanding evolution, mechanisms of pathogenesis
and genetic factors contributing to epidemics [32-34].
Reverse genetics systems addressing such topics should
express viral proteins that are closely related to those of
the naturally occurring virus. A reverse genetics system
has been developed for an attenuated strain of SAV2
originating from rainbow trout [10]. Here we report the
construction of a reverse genetics system that enables
the recovery of a recombinant SAV subtype 3 with putatively identical proteins to those previously reported
from the SAVH20/03 strain originally isolated from diseased Atlantic salmon in Norway [18]. The system can
be particularly useful for studies of evolution and
mechanisms of pathogenesis and transmission of SAV.

Results
Detection of the E2 glycoprotein in infected cells

Proper tools for detection of structural proteins from
SAV3 strains are essential for confirmation of a functional reverse genetics system. We therefore obtained an
antiserum against the E2 protein. A partial E2 coding
sequence of SAVH20/03 was chosen based on a nucleotide alignment with a known antigenic region in Sindbis
virus (SINV) and Ross River virus (RRV) (Figure 1a).
The fragment was successfully expressed as a His-tagged
peptide in E. coli (results not shown) and used to
immunize a rabbit. Specificity of the obtained antiserum

was verified by IFAT on Chinook salmon embryo
(CHSE) cell cultures infected with the wild type SAV3
strain SAVH20/03. A positive signal was localized to the
cell membrane (Figure 1b) and to cytoplasmic structures
believed to be ER and Golgi (Figure 1b, arrow) as visualized by confocal microscopy. This corresponds well
with the previously reported localization of E2 during
infections with SAV [7,35], as well as with the localization of E2 of terrestrial alphaviruses [16]. No staining
could be observed in mock treated cells (Figure 1b).

Construction of a full-length SAV3 cDNA clone

We have recently reported the construction of the DNA
replicon-construct pmSAV3, where a SAV3 RC
expresses an EGFP ORF from an alphavirus promoter
[9]. In order to obtain a full-length infectious clone, we
replaced the EGFP ORF with the structural ORF of SAV
through an introduced XbaI site (Figure 2a). The XbaI
site was kept in the final construct and functioned as a
genetic tag that could be used to verify the origin of
progeny virus from infectious clones. Sequencing of the

obtained full-length cDNA clone, prSAV3, revealed
amino acid sequence identity, but 10 nucleotide mutations, not leading to amino acid changes, were present
compared to previously reported consensus sequences
of SAVH20/03 (accession nos. AY604235 and
DQ149204). Of these, four were located in the nonstructural ORF, two constituted the genetic tag in the
junction, two were located in E2 and two were located
in the 3′UTR (Table 1). Selection of a proper E. coli
strain (XL10 Gold, Stratagene) was crucial for the propagation of these plasmids since proliferation of E. coli
strain Top10 (Invitrogen) was dramatically reduced after
transformation with plasmids harbouring the full-length
sequence.
Recovery of infectious recombinant SAV from cDNA

The ability of the full-length clone to express viral
structural proteins was addressed using the obtained
antiserum against E2. IFAT with anti-E2 on transfected Blue gill fry 2 (BF2) and CHSE cells demonstrated a positive signal 12 days post transfection (d.p.
t.) similar to that seen during infection with wild type
SAV (not shown). Passage of supernatant from transfected cells onto non-infected CHSE and BF2 cells followed by IFAT on these, confirmed presence of
infectious particles in the supernatant (Figure 2b). Following 3 passages in CHSE cells, a cytopathic effect
similar to that of wild type SAV infection was evident
(Figure 2c). The CPE included elongated, vacuolated
cells with pseudopodia-like extensions and curled up,
dead cells. The authenticity of the recombinant virus
(rSAV3) was verified by RT-PCR and sequencing on
passage 3 virus of the unique XbaI site that had been
introduced in the junction region of the rSAV3 genome (Figure 2d).

Recovery of infectious transgenic SAV with two
subgenomic promoters

A recombinant infectious virus with two subgenomic
promoters was obtained by introducing the structural
polyprotein ORF of SAV into a modified pmSAV3 replicon plasmid, making the final pEGFPrSAV3 plasmid
(Figure 3a). The sequence of pEGFPrSAV3 was identical
to that of prSAV3 with the exception of the additional
subgenomic cassette expressing EGFP from the subgenomic promoter of SAV located upstream of a transcription cassette expressing the structural ORF. The
exact start of the subgenomic promoter in the nsP4
sequence is not known for SAV, but the length of the
fragment chosen was based on a previously reported
SAV2 promoter that had been shown to be functional
[10]. The EGFP ORF is flanked by AgeI and AscI sites
that allow exchange of the EGFP ORF with other
cDNAs. Transfection of pEGFPrSAV3 into BF2 cells
produced EGFP expression 5 days p.t. Foci of cells
expressing EGFP were evident and the foci increased in
size the following days. Passage of supernatant from
transfected cells 8 d.p.t. onto new cells confirmed the
presence of infectious particles, and packaging of genomes with the EGFP transgene into these (Figure 3b).
CHSE cells infected with EGFPrSAV3 showed expression of EGFP already at 24 hours post infection (h.p.i.).
The EGFPrSAV3 virus gave weak or no CPE compared
to rSAV3, although the majority of cells were infected
(EGFP positive). In one experiment, passage 3 of EGFPrSAV3 was grown in CHSE and BF2 cells for 30 days.
After this prolonged incubation period less than 1% of
cells still expressed EGFP, suggesting either gradual loss
of the virus from cell culture or loss of/disruption of the
transgene when incubation time is very long. During the
work with constructing pEGFPrSAV3, a clone, pEGFPrSAV3nsP3263M323G was obtained that had accumulated
mutations in nsP3 positions 263 (K to M) and 323 (E to
G), likely a coincidence occurring during the cloning
process. This clone was studied further in order to test
the relative sensitivity of SAV to random mutations in
this conserved region of nsP3. Although replicating and
infectious recombinant virus expressing EGFP could be
recovered after transfection (not shown), these clones
appeared to spread slowly in infected cell cultures and
was no longer detectable after two passages (Table 2).
Mutations in nsP2197 and E2206 affect in vitro replication

Previously, we have associated a serine to proline mutation in E2206 of SAVH20/03 with cell culture adaptation
based on sequence comparison studies [25]. We also
recently reported a replicon based on the SAVH20/03
genome to differ from the wild type sequence through
an alanine to aspartic acid mutation in nsP2 197 [9].
Through genetic modifications of the prSAV3 plasmid,

Figure 3 Construction and validation of recombinant SAV3 with a double subgenomic promoter. (A) The full-length SAV3 was
engineered to contain an additional ORF encoding the EGFP protein under the control of a SAV specific promoter. The construct was obtained
by AscI/NotI cleavage and ligation of a PCR amplified fragment encoding SAV3 structural proteins and the SAV3 subgenomic promoter, into a
modified pmSAV3 plasmid. (B) The obtained construct was transfected into BF2 cells and expression of EGFP was visualized by fluorescence
microscopy. Presence of infectious virus containing the EGFP ORF was verified by serial passage of supernatant from transfected cells onto naïve

the nsP2197A or nsP2197 D was expressed in combination
with E2206 S or E2206P and all four viral mutants were
recovered and shown to be infectious by serial passage
in CHSE cells followed by IFAT (Table 2). A visible
CPE indistinguishable from wild type CPE was produced
by both mutants containing nsP2 197A , while no CPE
could be seen for mutants containing nsP2197 D (Figure
4a). IFAT on infected cells suggested that foci of infection were small with the nsP2197 D mutants and that the
majority of cells remained uninfected. After three passages in cell culture, infection by the two rSAV3nsP2197
D virus variants could not be detected by IFAT, while

cells infected with the clones containing the nsP2197A
remained readily detectable (Table 2). The E2 S206P
mutation did not cause lack of recognition by the E2
antiserum since indistinguishable staining was obtained
with the two virus mutants (Figure 4b). Sequencing of
the partial E2 coding sequence verified that both these
mutants were genetically stable during three passages in
CHSE cells (Figure 4c). Endpoint titration of supernatant from infected cell layers confirmed that the virus
titer was reduced in the nsP2 A197 D mutant while for
the E2S206P mutant the production of infectious particles
appeared to increase by almost one log (Table 3).

BF2 cells were transfected with 5 μg of plasmid encoding the respective
viruses, or infected with SAVH20/03. Supernatant was passed to new CHSE
cells three times. All viruses were detected by IFAT using anti E2 antiserum,
except EGFPrSAVnsP3mut and EGFPrSAV3 which were directly detected by
fluorescence microscopy. The relative amount of positive cells for each virus is
indicated (-/+/++/+++). SAVH20/03 served as positive control. ND = Not done.

Recombinant SAV with E2206P produced similar titers as
the wild type SAVH20/03 isolate also carrying the
E2206P.
The E2P206 S mutation has occurred recently and the
position is located on the protein surface

Structural predictions of E2 using the PredictProtein
server [36] and TMpred suggested that the transmembrane helix of SAVH20/03 E2 consists of amino acids
E2385A to E2404A, while E2206 appears to be located in a
loop area flanked by two sheet areas. Accessibility plots
of the protein further predicted the E2206 position to be
highly accessible (Figure 5a). Moreover, alignment with
E2 from other alphaviruses supported the idea of SAV
E2206 being located on the surface of the virus particle
(Figure 5b). Finally, a reconstruction of the evolutionary
history of the partial E2 protein of SAV suggested that
the proline is the ancient aa in this position and that
the serine has evolved in subtype 3 only (Figure 6).
Some SAV3 isolates also still carry the proline.

Discussion
SAV is a virus that is associated with mortality and significant economical loss for salmonid fish farmers in
Europe [4]. Still, important questions related to viral
and host mechanisms that contribute to transmission
and pathogenesis remain unanswered. Here we report
the development of infectious clones for a subtype 3
strain where the viral genome is transcribed by cellular
RNA polymerase II from a CMV promoter in a pVAX1
backbone. The recombinant virus was also engineered
to express non-viral RNA from an introduced, additional
subgenomic promoter. Subtype 3 appears to be genetically homogenous, indicating a relatively recent common source for all known isolates [25]. We therefore
designed the system to recover viruses that express proteins identical to those reported previously from

consensus sequences of SAVH20/03, the only subtype 3
strain where both ORFs have been completely
sequenced [9,18,25]. Such alphaviral reverse genetics
systems are suitable for studies of evolution and
mechanisms of emergence and pathogenesis. For
CHIKV, development of infectious clones with high
similarity to wild type CHIKV has led to identification
of point-mutations important for the emergence of epidemic strains [32-34]. Using the obtained SAV3 infectious clones, we demonstrated that point-mutations
indeed may alter the replication properties of SAV
dramatically.
The infectious clones were generated with focus on
expressing proteins that were identical in amino acid
sequence to those previously reported from SAVH20/03.
However, compared to previously reported sequences
from SAVH20/03, the prSAV3 plasmid contains 10
mutations that do not lead to amino acid change (Table
1). Although such mutations not leading to amino acid
changes certainly have the potential to affect viral replication, the obtained recombinant virus had titer production comparable to SAVH20/03 and other wild type
SAV isolates in cell culture [37]. Similar to some other
DNA-launched positive stranded RNA virus systems
[38,39] the exact rSAV3 3′-end is uncertain since transcription is stopped by the BGH signal in the pVAX1
vector, leaving some nonsense (non-viral) sequence
downstream of the introduced polyA tail. This nonsense
sequence will most likely be lost during replication,
since alphaviruses are believed to maintain and repair
their polyadenylated 3′-ends by the use of their RC
[40-42]. Still, future work could benefit from investigating the true 3′end of the obtained transcripts, and
potentially developing a more authentic 3′ end, for
example by inserting a Hepatitis delta virus ribozyme
immediately downstream of the polyA tail [39]. Such
studies could also focus on understanding the impact of
different lengths of polyA tails, as this has been reported
to affect replication of alphaviruses [43].
Single point mutations in the RC have previously been
shown to affect the replication efficiency of an attenuated strain of SAV2 [10]. When we recovered an infectious recombinant SAV3 strain, we made a similar
observation, as a mutation in nsP2 197 dramatically
reduced the ability of the virus to infect and replicate in
CHSE cells. This mutation is located in a conserved
region of nsP2 in alphaviruses, believed to include an
NTP binding motif that is essential for RNA triphosphatase, helicase and NTPase activity of the protein [44].
Thus, it is likely that an aspartic acid compared to the
wild type alanine in this position reduces efficiency of
the viral capping apparatus as well as helicase activity.
Similarly, the virus with two mutations in nsP3 had a
clearly reduced ability to replicate, and resulted in the

alanine or aspartic acid in nsP2197. (A) Infectious viruses were recovered from all plasmids after transfection into BF2 cells. The variants
expressing the nsP2197A produced CPE in CHSE cells, while viruses expressing nsP2197 D did not. The E2206 mutation did not appear to affect
CPE. Representative images of CPE are shown for each mutant. (B) The E2206 mutation did not affect antigenicity of the E2 protein notably, since

loss of the virus from infected cells after two passages.
Both mutations were located in a region of nsP3 that is
conserved among alphaviruses, but outside the described
macro domain [45,46]. Although these mutations
demonstrate that SAV can tolerate single amino acid
mutations in highly conserved motifs of the RC, they
also address the relatively large impact such single
mutations may have on the viral phenotype. This suggests that SAV, like other alphaviruses [31,32], has the
potential of major changes in some phenotypic features
as a result of minor genetic change. A similar observation has been done for a SAV2 strain which adapted to
replication at an elevated temperature through six mutations in the structural ORF [10].

Recently, studies of CHIKV have shown the power of
reverse genetics systems that are based on clones with
genomic sequences similar to wild-type/field isolate
sequences [31-33]. Such systems are suitable for identifying mutations that contribute to the emergence of outbreaks. Alphavirus epizootics appear to be particularly
associated with point mutations in the viral receptor protein E2 or the fusion protein E1 [31,32]. These mutations
could lead to changes in cell tropism and affinity for host
species [32]. We utilized the rSAV3 system to confirm
that the previously reported E2 S206P mutation [25]
enhances the viral titer production in CHSE cells. This is
in agreement with the hypothesis that this mutation may
be a beneficial adaptation for replication in CHSE cells.

Our phylogenetic analyses suggested, however, that a proline is the ancient aa residue in this position of E2 in natural populations of SAV, and that the mutation towards
serine is a relatively recent event that has happened in the
SAV3 subtype only. Alignments of sequences from SAV3
isolates have previously demonstrated that several SAV3
isolates still carry the proline [17,25]. This suggests that a
proline codon might still be part of a viral quasispecies in
SAV3 strains. If so, it could indicate a regulator of pathogenesis. In further support of this idea, in silico analyses

Conclusion
We have developed a functional reverse genetics system
that recovers recombinant SAV with identical proteins
as those reported from the genetically distinct SAVH20/
03 strain that was isolated in Norway in 2003 and suggested to represent a new viral subtype (SAV3) [18].
The system is suitable for studies of viral replication,
evolution and pathogenesis. It may also be used as a
gene delivery system in fish cells and for the development of live attenuated vaccines.
Methods
Cells and virus

sequences. Clusters corresponding to the SAV1-6 subtypes are

probabilities are given for key nodes.

predicted the E2206 to be located on the surface of the protein, probably in an area used for receptor recognition. It
appears, however, that the mutation does not have any
major effect on the antigenic properties, since both the
serine and proline mutants were readily detected by the
antiserum that was raised against a short peptide containing this region. Clearly, data from experimental transmission studies in fish are needed in order to better
understand the role, if any, of the E2S206P mutation during
an in vivo infection.
The pEGFPrSAV3, having a second subgenomic
alphavirus promoter, could be a potential tool for delivery and expression of foreign RNA in fish, e. g. an RNA
coding for an antigen or a reporter protein. Like other
alphavirus vectors, they could provide several advantages
over traditional vaccine vectors, since expression of the
antigen occurs in the context of a viral infection [47].
Another powerful future aspect of the pEGFPrSAV3
plasmid could be to address tissue tropism of SAV3
mutants through bioluminiscence imaging, as has been
done for other alphaviruses [33,48,49]. Such studies
could help clarify the role of tissue tropism in SAV
pathogenesis. We observed, however, that rSAV3 with
double subgenomic promoter is unstable similar to what
has been shown with such constructs for other alphaviruses [50]. It is possible that the virus is able to sustain
in only a small fraction of cells when it contains a transgene, but it is more likely that the transgene itself is gradually lost or mutated as the infection progresses due to
the lack of selection pressure. Further development of
these SAV based expression systems should therefore

Infected and non-infected Chinook salmon embryo
(CHSE) and Bluegill fry (BF2) cells were grown as previously described [25]. SAVH20/03 was used to infect
CHSE or BF2 cells that were incubated at 14°C. Cells
used for transfection were grown to approximately 80%
confluence prior to transfection. Transfected cells were
incubated at 20°C for 24 h before transfer to 14°C due
to increased effect of the CMV promoter at the elevated
temperature.
Development of Anti-E2 polyclonal antiserum

The coding sequence of the SAV3 E2 protein was
aligned with known immunogenic motifs of alphaviruses
SINV, RRV. Based on this alignment, a 348 bp cDNA
fragment containing a partial coding sequence of the E2
protein, was amplified by RT-PCR from CHSE cells
infected with SAVH20/03 using primers Fc1_E2 (CACCAAGGGCCACCACTTGTCCGA) and Rc1_E2
(TCACTTCACTTCCTTGCCTCCGC). The fragment
was cloned into prokaryotic expression vector pET200/
D-TOPO, to the C-terminus of a His-tag, using the
Champion pET TOPO Directional Expression kit (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. BL21
Star One Shot E. coli cells (Invitrogen) were transformed
with the pET200/E2 plasmid and expression of the Histagged peptide was induced using 1 mM isopropyl betaD-thiogalacto-pyranoside (IPTG) for four hours. Expression was verified by SDS-PAGE gel and Western blot
with the provided anti-his-G-HRP antibody. Purified
and dialysed protein was used for immunization of a
rabbit. The obtained anti-serum was pre-adsorbed onto
monolayers of CHSE cells fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and methanol.
Indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT)

CHSE-214 or BF2 cells were grown on cover-slips in 24
well plates or in 96 well plates and infected with

Karlsen et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:241
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/3/241

different SAV strains as indicated in the results section.
The cells were fixed and permeabilized with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and methanol. The cells were then
washed twice with PBS-FBS (PBS with 5% fetal bovine
serum), before blocking using 5% skimmed milk in PBSFBS for 30 min. The primary antibody anti-E2 was then
diluted 1:400 and incubated on the cells in PBS-FBS
with 5% skimmed milk for 60 min at room temperature.
Following antibody incubation, cells were washed three
times, and incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat antirabbit secondary antibody (Invitrogen) in PBS-FBS with
5% skimmed milk for 60 min at room temperature.
Finally, the cells were washed three times with PBS and
directly examined in an Olympus IXI fluorescence
microscope, or mounted using ProLong Gold with
DAPI (Invitrogen) and visualized using a Leica TCS SP2
AOBS confocal microscope. Mock infected cells and
cells not treated with primary antibody served as negative controls.
Construction of a full-length SAV3 cDNA clone

Total RNA was extracted from infected CHSE cells and
reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer
primers according to standard techniques. Three PCR
fragments, covering the entire structural ORF, were
obtained and assembled by ligation into the pVAX1 vector (Invitrogen), leading to the pVAX1/SAV3 SP construct. The structural polyprotein ORF was further
subcloned into a pCI vector (Promega) using the restriction sites EcoRI and NotI, after the correction of some
mutations introduced during cloning, leading to the
construct pCI/SAV3 SP*. In order to clone the 3′UTR
sequence at the extremity of the SAV3 SP ORF
sequence, the 3′UTR was obtained by RT-PCR using the
primers PDuniF (CCGCACGGTTGTAAGATCAGT)
and NotIXbaIPolyAR [9] and inserted into pCI/SAV3
SP* by StuI/NotI digestion and ligation, leading to the
construct pCI/SAV3 SP+3′UTR.
An XbaI site was introduced by site-directed mutagenesis into the junction region within a previously
reported replicon construct that contains a SAV3
replicon expressing EGFP in a pVAX1 backbone [9].
The construct was further engineered to express the
wild type nsP2197A, leading to the plasmid pmSAV3wt.
The EGFP ORF and 3′UTR was then exchanged with
an XbaI fragment from the pCI/SAV3 SP+3′UTR plasmid. The authenticity of the obtained full-length construct, prSAV3, was verified by REN analysis and
DNA sequencing as previously described [25]. All
plasmids were replicated in XL10 Gold competent E.
coli cells (Stratagene), and purified using Qiagen
Endofree plasmid maxi kit according to the manufacturer’s protocol.

Recovery of infectious recombinant virus

The prSAV3 plasmid (5 μg) was transfected into BF2
cells (passage 0) using Amaxa nucleofector kit T
(Lonza) as recommended by the manufacturer. Transfected cells were then cultured as previously described
[9]. Twelve d.p.t., supernatant from transfected cells was
passed to freshly prepared CHSE cells. Transfected and
infected cell layers were tested by IFAT for expression
of the E2 glycoprotein. Infected CHSE cells (passage 3)
were harvested 7 days p.i., and extracted RNA was used
as template for RT-PCR using SAV3 specific primers
544F (ATGATATGATGGTGGCCAGG) and 1238R
(GCTCCCTTTCTTCTCCTGTTG). The obtained PCR
product was sequenced and analysed for the presence of
the introduced XbaI site.
Construction and recovery of recombinant SAV3 carrying
an additional subgenomic transcription cassette

A plasmid pEGFPrSAV3 where an additional ORF encoding EGFP under the SAV3 subgenomic promoter is placed
upstream of the SAV3 structural transcription unit, was
constructed based on the pmSAV3wt plasmid. A cDNA
containing the structural ORF, 3′ UTR, polyA tail and a
presumed SAV3 subgenomic promoter which includes the
junction region and the 3′-terminal 92 nucleotides of nsP4
(including the stop codon), was amplified from the
prSAV3 plasmid using primers nsP4pro (GGGGC
GCGCCGCGTGAATCACCTGCCGTTAGCCAC) and
NotIXbaIPolyAR. The obtained cDNA was inserted into
pmSAV3wt by AscI/NotI digestion and ligation. Authenticity of the plasmid was verified by sequencing of the complete transcription unit. One of the obtained clones,
named pEGFPrSAV3nsP3263M323G, contained two amino
acid mutations in nsP3 that probably were introduced as
artefacts during cloning. Transfection and recovery of
infectious virus was done as described above, and expression of the EGFP transgene was verified by direct fluorescence microscopy of infected cells and photographed
using an Olympus IXI camera.
Analysis of the effect of point mutations in nsP2 and E2
on the viral titer production

Infectious clones were engineered to test the effect of
the nsP2D197A and E2S206P mutations. The clone prSAV3E2206P was made by site-directed mutagenesis using a
QuickChange XL Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The
clones prSAV3nsP2197DE2206 S and prSAV3 nsP2197DE2206P
were generated by replacing the BstBI/NhiI fragments in
prSAV3 and prSAV3E2206P with one from the previously
reported pmSAV3 plasmid. The transcription units of
all plasmids were sequenced completely prior to transfection. Transfections and recovery of infectious virus
was done as described above. Recovered viruses were

passaged in CHSE cells and supernatant from day 7 p.i.
was titrated in 96 well plates using endpoint titration.
Titers were calculated using the Kärber formula [52]. In
addition to cytopathic effect, IFAT with anti-E2 was
done in all wells as described above in order to confirm
the presence or absence of infection. Finally, a cDNA
containing the partial E2 gene was amplified by RT-PCR
using primers F2234 and SAV20R [25] and sequenced
from infected cell layers in passage three in order to
verify that the E2206P and E2206 S mutations were stable.
Bioinformatical analyses

Predictions of protein secondary structure and solvent
accessibility were obtained by submitting the complete
E2 sequence of SAVH20/03 to the PredictProtein server
[35]. Transmembrane helices were predicted using
TMpred http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_form.html. A nucleotide alignment (357 nt) was generated based on 67 previously reported SAV sequences
covering the E2 position 206 (accession numbers
AJ316244, AJ316246, EF675551 to EF675577, EF675579
to EF675594 and DQ122127 to DQ122146) [17,25].
Sequences were aligned by AlignX in the VectorNTI
package (Invitrogen). The alignment was imported into
the software package BEAST for Bayesian reconstruction
of phylogeny [53]. The GTR model of nucleotide evolution with a four category gamma rate, and a constant
population size assumption, was chosen. Trees were
constructed using a relaxed lognormal clock assumption.
A prior in lognormal distribution was set on the mean
rate parameter, based on a previously reported substitution rate [25]. The MCMC chains were run for 20 million generations and the results were inspected in
Tracer 1.4. ESS values were higher than 200 for all parameters. A maximum clade credibility tree was viewed
using FigTree, and the tree was obtained using a 10%
burnin in TreeAnnotator.
