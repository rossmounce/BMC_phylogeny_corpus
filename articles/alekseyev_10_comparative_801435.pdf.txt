Comparative genomics reveals birth and death of
fragile regions in mammalian evolution
Max A Alekseyev1*, Pavel A Pevzner2*

Abstract
Background: An important question in genome evolution is whether there exist fragile regions (rearrangement
hotspots) where chromosomal rearrangements are happening over and over again. Although nearly all recent
studies supported the existence of fragile regions in mammalian genomes, the most comprehensive phylogenomic
study of mammals raised some doubts about their existence.
Results: Here we demonstrate that fragile regions are subject to a birth and death process, implying that fragility
has a limited evolutionary lifespan.
Conclusions: This finding implies that fragile regions migrate to different locations in different mammals,
explaining why there exist only a few chromosomal breakpoints shared between different lineages. The birth and
death of fragile regions as a phenomenon reinforces the hypothesis that rearrangements are promoted by
matching segmental duplications and suggests putative locations of the currently active fragile regions in the
human genome.

Background
In 1970 Susumu Ohno [1] came up with the Random
Breakage Model (RBM) of chromosome evolution,
implying that there are no rearrangement hotspots in
mammalian genomes. In 1984 Nadeau and Taylor [2]
laid the statistical foundations of RBM and demonstrated that it was consistent with the human and
mouse chromosomal architectures. In the next two decades, numerous studies with progressively increasing
resolution made RBM the de facto theory of chromosome evolution.
RBM was refuted by Pevzner and Tesler [3] who suggested the Fragile Breakage Model (FBM) postulating
that mammalian genomes are mosaics of fragile and
solid regions. In contrast to RBM, FBM postulates that
rearrangements are mainly happening in fragile regions
forming only a small portion of the mammalian genomes. While the rebuttal of RBM caused a controversy
[4-6], Peng et al. [7] and Alekseyev and Pevzner [8]
revealed some flaws in the arguments against FBM.

Furthermore, the rebuttal of RBM was followed by
many studies supporting FBM [9-31].
Comparative analysis of the human chromosomes
reveals many short adjacent regions corresponding to
parts of several mouse chromosomes [32]. While such a
surprising arrangement of synteny blocks points to
potential rearrangement hotspots, it remains unclear
whether these regions reflect genome rearrangements or
duplications/assembly errors/alignment artifacts. Early
studies of genomic architectures were unable to distinguish short synteny blocks from artifacts and thus were
limited to constructing large synteny blocks. Ma et al.
[33] addressed the challenge of constructing high-resolution synteny blocks via the analysis of multiple genomes. Remarkably, their analysis suggests that there is
limited breakpoint reuse, an argument against FBM, that
led to a split among researchers studying chromosome
evolution and raised a challenge of reconciling these
contradictory results. Ma et al. [33] wrote: ‘a careful
analysis [of the RBM vs FBM controversy] is beyond the
scope of this study’ leaving the question of interpreting
their findings open. Various models of chromosome
evolution imply various statistics and thus can be verified by various tests. For example, RBM implies exponential distribution of the synteny block sizes, consistent

with the human-mouse synteny blocks observed in [2].
Pevzner and Tesler [3] introduced the ‘pairwise breakpoint reuse’ test and demonstrated that while RBM
implies low breakpoint reuse, the human-mouse synteny
blocks expose rampant breakpoint reuse. Thus RBM is
consistent with the ‘exponential length distribution’ test
[2] but inconsistent with the ‘pairwise breakpoint reuse’
test [34]. Both these tests are applied to pairs of genomes, not taking an advantage of multiple genomes that
were recently sequenced. Below we introduce the ‘multispecies breakpoint reuse’ test and demonstrate that both
RBM and FBM do not pass this test. We further propose the Turnover Fragile Breakage Model (TFBM) that
extends FBM and complies with the multispecies breakpoint reuse test.
Technically, findings in [33] (limited breakpoint reuse
between different lineages) are not in conflict with findings in [3] (rampant breakpoint reuse in chromosome
evolution). Indeed, Ma et al. [33] only considered reuse
between different branches of the phylogenetic tree
(inter-reuse) and did not analyze reuse within individual
branches (intra-reuse) of the tree. TFBM reconciles the
recent studies supporting FBM with the Ma et al. [33]
analysis. We demonstrate that data in [33] reveal rampant but elusive breakpoint reuse that cannot be
detected via counting repeated breakages between various pairs of branches of the evolutionary tree. TFBM is
an extension of FBM that reconciles seemingly contradictory results in [9-31] and [33] and explains that they
do not contradict to each other. TFBM postulates that
fragile regions have a limited lifespan and implies that
they can migrate between different genomic locations.
The intriguing implication of TFBM is that few regions
in a genome are fragile at any given time raising a question of finding the currently active fragile regions in the
human genome.
While many authors have discussed the causes of fragility, the question what makes certain regions fragile
remains open. Previous studies attributed fragile regions
to segmental duplications [35-38], high repeat density
[39], high recombination rate [40], pairs of tRNA genes
[41,42], inhomogeneity of gene distribution [7], and long
regulatory regions [7,17,26]. Since we observed the birth
and death of fragile regions, we are particularly interested in features that are also subject to birth and death
process. Recently, Zhao and Bourque [38] provided a
new insight into association of rearrangements with segmental duplications by demonstrating that many rearrangements are flanked by Matching Segmental
Duplications (MSDs), that is, a pair of long similar
regions located within a pair of breakpoint regions corresponding to a rearrangement event. MSDs arguably
represent an ideal match for TFBM among the features
that were previously implicated in breakpoint reuses.

TFBM is consistent with the hypothesis that MSDs promote fragility since the similarity between MSDs deteriorates with time, implying that MSDs are also subjects
to a ‘birth and death’ process.

Results and Discussion
Rearrangements and breakpoint graphs

For the sake of simplicity, we start our analysis with circular genomes consisting of circular chromosomes.
While we use circular chromosomes to simplify the
computational concepts discussed in the paper, all analysis is done with real (linear) mammalian chromosomes
(see Alekseyev [43] for subtle differences between circular and linear chromosome analysis). We represent a circular chromosome with synteny blocks x 1 ,..., x n as a
cycle (Figure 1a) composed of n directed labeled edges
(corresponding to the blocks) and n undirected unlabeled edges (connecting adjacent blocks). The directions
of the edges correspond to signs (strands) of the blocks.
We label the tail and head of a directed edge xi as x it
and x ih respectively. We represent a genome as a genome graph consisting of disjoint cycles (one for each
chromosomes). The edges in each cycle alternate
between two colors: one color reserved for undirected
edges and the other color (traditionally called ‘obverse’)
reserved for directed edges.
Let P be a genome represented as a collection of alternating black-obverse cycles (a cycle is alternating if the
colors of its edges alternate). For any two black edges
(u; υ) and (x; y) in the genome (graph) P , we define a
2-break rearrangement (see [44]) as replacement of
these edges with either a pair of edges (u, x), (υ, y ), or a
pair of edges (u, y), (υ, x) (Figure 2). 2-breaks extend the
standard operations of reversals (Figure 2a), fissions
(Figure 2b), or fusions/translocations (Figure 2c) to the
case of circular chromosomes. We say that a 2-break on
edges (u, x), (υ, y) uses vertices u, x, υ and y.
Let P and Q be ‘black’ and ‘red’ genomes on the same
set of synteny blocks X. The breakpoint graph G(P, Q )
is defined on the set of vertices V = {xt, xh | x Î c} with
black and red edges inherited from genomes P and Q
(Figure 1b). The black and red edges form a collection
of alternating black-red cycles in G(P, Q ) and play an
important role in analyzing rearrangements (see [45] for
background information on genome rearrangements).
The trivial cycles in G(P, Q), formed by pairs of parallel
black and red edges, represent common adjacencies
between synteny blocks in genomes P and Q. Vertices of
the non-trivial cycles in G(P, Q) represent breakpoints
that partition genomes P and Q into (P, Q)-synteny
blocks (Figure 1c). The 2-break distance d(P, Q)
between circular genomes P and Q is defined as the
minimum number of 2-breaks required to transform
one genome into the other (Figure 1d). In contrast to

two-chromosomal genome P = (+a + b)(+c + e + -d) as two black-obverse cycles and a unichromosomal genome Q = (+a + b - e + c - d) as a

removed obverse edges). The black and red edges in G(P, Q) form c(P, Q) = 2 non-trivial black-red cycles and one trivial black-red cycle. The
trivial cycle (ah, bt) corresponds to a common adjacency between the genes a and b in the genomes P and Q. The vertices in the non-trivial
cycles represent breakpoints corresponding to the endpoints of b(P, Q) = 4 synteny blocks: ab, c, d, and e. By Theorem 1, the distance between
the genomes P and Q is d(P, Q) = 4 - 2 = 2. (d) A transformation of the breakpoint graph G(P, Q) into the identity breakpoint graph G(Q, Q),
corresponding to a transformation of the genome P into the genome Q with two 2-breaks. The first 2-break transforms P into a genome P’ =
(+a + b)(+c d - e), while the second 2-break transforms P’ into Q. Each 2-break increases the number of black-red cycles in the breakpoint graph
by one, implying this transformation is shortest (see Theorem 1).

intra-reuse is to define weighted intra-reuse of a vertex υ
on a branch e as max{0, use(e, υ) -1} where use(e, υ) is
the number of 2-breaks on e using υ. The weighted
intra-reuse BR(e ) on the branch e is the sum of
weighted intra-reuse of all vertices. We remark that if
no vertex is used more than twice on a branch e then
BR(e) = br(e).
Given simulated data, one can compute br(e) for all
branches and br(e1, e2 ) for all pairs of branches in the
phylogenetic tree. However, for real data, rearrangements along the branches are unknown, calling for alternative ways for estimating the inter- and intra-reuse.
Cycles in the breakpoint graphs provide yet another
way to estimate the inter- and intra-reuse. For a branch
e = (P, Q) of the phylogenetic tree, one can estimate br
(e) by comparing the 2-break distance d(P, Q ) and the
number of breakpoints 2 · b(P, Q) between the genomes
P and Q. This results in the lower bound bound(e) = 4 ·
d(P, Q) -2 · b(P, Q) for BR(e) [34] that also gives a good
approximation for br(e ). On the other hand, one can
estimate br(e1, e2) as the number bound(e1, e2) of vertices shared between non-trivial cycles in the breakpoint
graphs corresponding to the branches e1 and e2 (similar
approach was used in [48] and later explored in [12,33]).
Assuming that the genomes at the internal nodes of the
phylogenetic tree can be reliably reconstructed
[33,49-51], one can compute bound(e) and bound(e1, e2)
for all (pairs of) branches. Below we show that these
bounds accurately approximate the intra- and interreuse.

the genomic distance [46] (for linear genomes), the 2break distance for circular genomes is easy to compute
[47]:
Theorem 1 The 2-break distance between circular
genomes P and Q is d(P, Q) = b(P, Q) - c(P, Q), where b
(P, Q ) and c(P, Q) are respectively the number of (P,
Q)-synteny blocks and non-trivial black-red cycles in G
(P, Q).
Inter- and intra-breakpoint reuse

Figure 3 shows a phylogenetic tree with specified rearrangements on its branches (we write r Î e to refer to a
2-break r on an edge e ). We represent each genome as
a genome graph (that is, a collection of cycles) on the
same set V of 2n vertices (corresponding to the endpoints of the synteny blocks). Given a set of genomes
and a phylogenetic tree describing rearrangements
between these genomes, we define the notions of interand intra-breakpoint reuses. A vertex υ Î V is interreused on two distinct branches e1 and e2 of a phylogenetic tree if there exist 2-breaks r 1 Î e 1 and r 2 Î e 2
that both use υ. Similarly, a vertex υ Î V is intra-reused
on a branch e if there exist two distinct 2-breaks r1, r2
Î e that both use υ. For example, a vertex ch is interreused on the branches (Q 3 , P1 ) and (Q2 , P3 ), while a
vertex fh is intra-reused on the branch (Q3, Q2) of the
tree in Figure 3. We define br(e1, e2) as the number of
vertices inter-reused on the branches e1 and e2, and br
(e) as the number of vertices intra-reused on the branch
e. An alternative approach to measuring breakpoint

Analyzing breakpoint reuse (simulated genomes)

We start from analyzing simulated data based on FBM
with n fragile regions present in k genomes that evolved
according to a certain phylogenetic tree (for the varying
parameter n ). We represent one of the leaf genomes as
the genome with 20 random circular chromosomes and
simulate hundred 2-breaks on each branch of the tree.
Figure 4 represents a phylogenetic tree on five leaf
genomes, denoted M, R, D, Q, H, and three ancestral
genomes, denoted MR, MRD, QH. Table in Figure 5
presents the results of a single FBM simulation and
illustrates that bound(e 1 , e 2 ) provides an excellent
approximation for inter-reuses br(e1, e2 ) for all 21 pairs
of branches. While bound(e) (on the diagonal of table in
Figure 5) is somewhat less accurate, it also provides a
reasonable approximation for br(e). We remark that
bound(e 1 , e 2 ) = br(e 1 , e 2 ) if simulations produce the
shortest rearrangement scenarios on the branches e 1
and e2. Table in Figure 5 illustrates that this is mainly
the case for our simulations.
Below we describe analytical approximations for the
values in table in Figure 5. Since every 2-break uses four
out of 2n vertices in the genome graph, a random 2break uses a vertex υ with the probability 2 . Thus, a
n

sequence of t random 2-breaks does not use a vertex υ
with the probability (1 − 2 ) t ≈ e
n

− 2t
n ( for

t  n ) . For

branches e1 and e2 with respectively t1 and t2 random
2-breaks, the probability that a particular vertex is
inter-reused on e 1 and e 2 is approximated as

(1 − e

of

) ⋅ (1 − e

is

as

. Below we will compare the

observed inter-reuse with the expected inter-reuse in
FBM to see whether they are similar thus checking
whether FBM represents a reasonable null hypothesis.
We will use the term scaled inter-reuse to refer to the
observed inter-reuse divided by the expected inter-reuse.
If FBM is an adequate null hypothesis we expect the
scaled inter-reuse to be close to one.
Similarly, a sequence of t random 2-breaks uses
a vertex υ exactly once with the probability

(

t⋅ 2 ⋅ 1− 2

)

t −1

≈ 2t e

2(t −1)

divided by the expected intra-reuse. Table S1 in Additional file 1 shows the scaled intra- and inter-reuse for
21 pairs of branches (averaged over 100 simulations)
and illustrates that they all are close to one.
We now perform a similar simulation, this time varying the number of 2-breaks on the branches according

genomes with n fragile regions (n = 500, 900, 1, 300). The diagonal elements represent intra-reuses while the elements above diagonal
represent inter-reuses. In each cell with numbers x : y, x represents the observed reuse while y represents the corresponding lower bound. The
cells of the table are colored red (for adjacent branches like M+ and R+), green (for branches that are separated by a single branch like M+ and

to the branch lengths specified in Figure 4. Table S2 in
Additional file 1 (similar to Table S1 in Additional file
1) illustrates that the lower bounds also provide accurate
approximations in the case of varying branch lengths.
Similar results were obtained in the case of evolutionary
trees with varying topologies (data are not shown). We
therefore use only lower bounds to generate table in
Figure 6 rather than showing both real distances and
the lower bounds as in table in Figure 5.
In the case when the branch lengths vary, we find it
convenient to represent data in Table S2 in Additional
file 1 in a different way (as a plot) that better illustrates variability in the scaled inter-use. We define the
distance between branches e 1 and e 2 in the phylogenetic tree as the distance between their midpoints, that
is, the overall length of the path, starting at e 1 and
d(e 1 ) + d(e 2 )
. For example,

56 + 28
d( M +, H + ) = 56 + 170 + 58 + 28 −
= 270 (see Fig2

ending at e 2 , minus

ure 4). The x-axis in Figure S1 in Additional file 1, 2
represents the distances between pairs of branches (21

pairs total), while y-axis represents the scaled interreuse for pairs of branches at the distance x.
Surprising irregularities in breakpoint reuse in
mammalian genomes

The branch lengths shown in Figure 4 actually represent
the approximate numbers of rearrangements on the
branches of the phylogenetic tree for Mouse, Rat, Dog,
macaQue, and Human genomes (represented in the
alphabet of 433 ‘large’ synteny blocks exceeding 500,
000 nucleotides in human genome [50]). For the mammalian genomes, M, R, D, Q, and H, we first used
MGRA [50] to reconstruct genomes of their common
ancestors (denoted MR, MRD, and QH in Figure 4) and
further estimated the breakpoint inter-reuse between
pairs of branches of the phylogenetic tree. The resulting
table in Figure 7 reveals some striking differences from
the simulated data (Figure 6) that follow a peculiar pattern: the larger is the distance between two branches,
the smaller is the amount of inter-reuse between them
(in contrast to RBM/FBM where the amount of interreuse does not depend on the distance between

have not described yet how to compare the amount of
inter-reuse for different branches at various distances.
However, we can already illustrate this phenomenon by
considering branches of similar length that presumably
influence the inter-reuse in a similar way (see below).

belonging to the same columns in table in Figure 8
should be similar. This is indeed the case for simulated
data (small variations within each column) but not the
case for real data. In fact, maximal elements in each column for real data exceed other elements by a factor of
three to five (with an exception of the MR+ column).
Moreover, the peculiar pattern associated with these
maximal elements (maximal elements correspond to red
cells) suggests that this effect is unlikely to be caused by
random variations in breakpoint reuses. We remind the
reader that red cells correspond to pairs of adjacent
branches in the evolutionary tree suggesting that breakpoint reuse is maximal between close branches and is
reducing with evolutionary time. A similar pattern is
observed for the other pairs of branches of similar
length: adjacent branches feature much higher interreuse than distant branches. We also remark that the
most distant pairs of branches (H+ and M+, H+ and R+,
Q+ and M+, Q+ and R+ in the yellow cells) feature the
lowest inter-reuse. The only branch that shows relatively
similar inter-reuse (varying from 58 to 80) with the
branches M+, R+, and QH+ is the branch MR+ which is
adjacent to each of these branches.
Below we modify FBM to come up with a new model
of chromosome evolution, explaining the surprising irregularities in the inter-reuse across mammalian genomes.
Turnover fragile breakage model: birth and death of
fragile regions

We start with a simulation of 100 rearrangements on
every branch of the tree in Figure 4. However, instead
of assuming that fragile regions are fixed, we assume
that after every rearrangement x fragile regions ‘die’ and
x fragile regions are ‘born’ (keeping a constant number
of fragile regions throughout the simulation). We
assume that the genome has m potentially ‘breakable’
sites but only n of them are currently fragile (n ≤ m)
(the remaining n - m sites are currently solid). The
dying regions are randomly selected from n currently

fragile regions, while the newly born regions are randomly selected from m - n solid regions. The simplest
TFBM with a fixed rate of the ‘birth and death’ process
is defined by the parameters m, n, and turnover rate x.
FBM is a particular case of TFBM corresponding to x =
0 and n <m, while RBM is a particular case of TFBM
corresponding to x = 0 and n = m. While this over-simplistic model with a fixed turnover rate may not adequately describe the real rearrangement process, it
allows one to analyze the general trends and to compare
them to the trends observed in real data. We further
remark that the goal of this paper is to develop a test
for distinguishing between TFBM and FBM/RBM rather
than a test for distinguishing between FBM and RBM.
Thus, our simulations do not distinguish between FBM
(x = 0 and n <m) and RBM (x = 0 and n = m) since
they do not affect m - n inactive breakpoints in FBM.
To distinguish FBM from RBM, one has to analyze the
long cycles in the breakpoint graph and the distribution
of synteny block sizes (see [3,8]).
The leftmost subtable of Figure 9 with x = 0 represents an equivalent of table in Figure 5 for FBM and
reveals that the inter-reuse is roughly the same on all
pairs of branches (approximately 110 for n = 500,
approximately 70 for n = 900, approximately 50 for n =
1, 300). The right subtables of Figure 9 represent
equivalents of the leftmost subtable for TFBM with the
turnover rate x = 1, 2, 3 and reveal that the inter-reuse
in yellow cells is lower than in green cells, while the
inter-reuse in green cells is lower than in red cells.
Figure 10 shows the scaled inter-reuse averaged over
yellow, green, and red cells that reveals a different behavior between FBM and TFBM. Indeed, while the scaled
inter-reuse is close to 1 for all pairs of branches in the
case of FBM, it varies in the case of TFBM. For example, for n = 900, m = 2, 000, and x = 3, the inter-reuse
in yellow cells is approximately 40, in green cells is
approximately 45, and in red cells is approximately 56.

the inter-reuse between red, green, and yellow cells as a
function of m and x (for n = 900). In Methods we
describe a formula for estimating the breakpoint interreuse in the case of TFBM that accurately approximates
the values shown in Figure 10.
Table S3 in Additional file 1 demonstrates that the
distribution of inter-reuses among green, red, and yellow
cells differs between FBM and TFBM. We argue that
this distribution (for example, the slope of the curve in
Figure 10) represents yet another test to confirm or
reject FBM/TFBM. However, while it is clear how to
apply this test to the simulated data (with known rearrangements), it remains unclear how to compute it for
real data when the ancestral genomes (as well as the
parameters of the model) are unknown. While the
ancestral genomes can be reliably approximated using
the algorithms for ancestral genome reconstruction
[33,49-51], estimating the number of fragile regions
remains an open problem (see [3]). Below we develop a
new test (that does not require knowledge of the number of the fragile regions n ) and demonstrate that FBM
does not pass this test while TFBM does, explaining the
surprisingly low inter-reuse in mammalian genomes.
Multispecies breakpoint reuse test

Given a phylogenetic tree describing a rearrangement
scenario, we define the multispecies breakpoint reuse on
this tree as follows. For two rearrangements r1 and r2
in the scenario, we define the distance d(r1, r2) as the
number of rearrangements in the scenario between r1
and r 2 plus one. For example, the distance between
2-breaks r4 and r6 in the tree in Figure 3 is four. We
define the (actual) multispecies breakpoint reuse as a
function

R() =

∑

 1 ,  2 : d (  1 ,  2 )= 

∑

br(  1 ,  2 )

 1 ,  2 : d (  1 ,  2 )= 

1

that represents the total breakpoint reuse between
pairs of rearrangements r1, r2 at the distance l divided
by the number of such pairs. Here br(r1, r2) stands for
the number of vertices used by both 2-breaks r1 and r2.
Since the rearrangements on branches of the phylogenetic tree are unknown, we use the following sampling
procedure to approximate R(l). Given genomes P and Q,
we sample various shortest rearrangement scenarios
between these genomes by generating random 2-break
transformations of P into Q. To generate a random
transformation we first randomly select a non-trivial
cycle C in the breakpoint graph G(P, Q) with the probability proportional to |C|/ = 2 - 1, that is, the number
of 2-breaks required to transform such a cycle into a

Page 10 of 15

collection of trivial cycles (|C| stands for the length of
C). Then we uniformly randomly select a 2-break r
from the set of all (

|C|/2

2

)=

| C | (| C | −2)
2-breaks that
8

splits the selected cycle C into 2 8 two and thus by Theorem 1 decreases the distance between P and Q by one
(that is, d(r P, Q) = d(P, Q) -1). We continue selecting
non-trivial cycles and 2-breaks in an iterative fashion for
genomes r · P and Q and so on until P is transformed
into Q.
The described sampling can be performed for every
branch e = (P, Q) of the phylogenetic tree, essentially
partitioning e into length(e) = d(P, Q) sub-branches,
each featuring a single 2-break. The resulting tree will
have ∑e length(e) sub-branches, where the sum is taken
over all branches e.
For each pair of sub-branches, we compute the number of reused vertices across them and accumulate these
numbers according to the distance between these subbranches in the tree. The empirical multispecies breakpoint reuse (the average reuse between all sub-branches
at the distance l) is defined as the actual multispecies
breakpoint reuse in a sampled rearrangement scenario.
Figure S2 in Additional file 1 represents this function
for five simulated genomes on m = 2, 000 synteny
blocks, n = 900 fragile regions, and the turnover rate x
varying from zero to four, with the same phylogenetic
tree and distances between the genomes (averaged over
100 random samplings, while individual samplings produce varying results, we found that the variance of the R
(l) estimates across various samplings is rather small).
Figure S3 in Additional file 1 demonstrates that our
sampling procedure, while imperfect, accurately estimates the theoretical R(l) curve (see [52] for other
approaches to sampling rearrangement scenarios). Similar tests on phylogenetic trees with varying topologies
demonstrated a good fit between actual, empirical, and
theoretical R(l) curves (data are not shown).
For the five mammalian genomes, the plot of R(l) is
shown in Figure 11. From this empirical curve we estimated the parameters n ≈ 196, x ≈ 1:12, and m ≈ 4, 017
(see Methods) and displayed the corresponding theoretical curve. We remark that the estimated parameter n in
TFBM is expected to be larger than the observed number of synteny blocks (since not all potentially breakable
regions were broken in a given evolutionary scenario).
Figure S4 in Additional file 1 represents an analog of
Figure 11 for the same genomes in higher resolution
and illustrates that all three parameters n, x, and m
depend on the data resolution.
We argue that the empirical multispecies breakpoint
reuse curve R(l) complements the ‘exponential length
distribution’ [2] and ‘pairwise breakpoint reuse’ [3] tests

as the third criterion to accept/reject RBM, FBM, and
now TFBM. One can use the parameters n and x (estimated from empirical R(l) curve) to evaluate the extent
of the ‘birth and death’ process and to explain why Ma
et al. [33] found so few shared breakpoints between
different mammalian lineages. In practice, the ‘multispecies breakpoint reuse test’ can be applied in the same way
as the Nadeau-Taylor ‘exponential length distribution test’
was applied in numerous papers. The Nadeau-Taylor test
typically amounted to constructing a histogram of synteny
blocks and evaluating (often visually) whether it fits the
exponential distribution. Similarly, the ‘multispecies breakpoint reuse test’ amounts to constructing R(l) curve and
evaluating whether it significantly deviates from a horizontal line suggested by RBM and FBM. The estimated parameters of the TFBM model (see Methods) can be used to
quantify the extent of these deviations.
TFBM also raises an intriguing question of what triggers the birth and death of fragile regions. As demonstrated by Zhao and Bourque [38], the disproportionately

large number of rearrangements in primate lineages are
flanked by MSDs. TFBM is consistent with the ZhaoBourque hypothesis that rearrangements are triggered by
MSDs since MSDs are also subject to the ‘birth and
death’ process. Indeed, after a segmental duplication the
pair of matching segments becomes subjected to random
mutations and the similarity between these segments dissolves with time (a pair of segmental duplications ‘disappears’ after approximately 40 million years of evolution if
one adopts the parameters for defining segmental duplications from [53]).
The mosaic structure of segmental duplications [53]
provides an additional explanation of how MSDs may
promote breakpoint re-uses and generate long cycles
typical for the breakpoint graphs of mammalian genomes. The future studies of the correlation between fragile regions and MSDs in the human genome will
benefit from the algorithms for precise detection of rearrangement breakpoints [54] and will be described
elsewhere.

Fragile regions in the human genome

Imagine the following gedanken experiment: 25 million
years ago (time of the human-macaque split) a scientist
sequences the genome of the human-macaque ancestor
(QH) and attempts to predict the sites of (future) rearrangements in the (future) human genome. The only
other information the scientist has is the mouse, rat,
and dog genomes. While RBM offers no clues on how
to make such a prediction, FBM suggests that the scientist should use the breakpoints between one of the available genomes and QH as a proxy for fragile regions. For
example, there are 552 breakpoints between the mouse
genome (M) and QH and 34 of them were actually used
in the human lineage, resulting in only 34 = 552 ≈ 6%
accuracy in predicting future human breakpoints
(we use synteny blocks larger than 500 K from [50]).
TFBM suggests that the scientist should rather use the
closest genome to QH to better predict the human
breakpoints. That can be achieved by first reconstructing the common ancestor (MRD) of mouse, rat, dog,
and human-macaque ancestor and then using the breakpoints between MRD and QH as a proxy for the sites of
rearrangements in the human lineage. 18 out 162 breakpoints between MRD and QH were used in the human
lineage, resulting in 18 = 162 ≈ 11% accurate prediction
of human breakpoints, nearly doubling the accuracy of
predictions from distant genomes.
Now imagine that the scientist somehow gained access
to the extant macaque genome. There are 68 breakpoints between Q and QH and 10 of them were used in
the human lineage, resulting in 10 = 68 ≈ 16% accurate
prediction of human breakpoints, again improving the
accuracy of predictions. These estimates indicate that
TFBM can be used to improve the prediction accuracy
of future rearrangements in various lineages and demonstrate that the sites of recent rearrangements in the
human and other primate lineages represent the best
guess for the currently active fragile regions in the
human genome.
We therefore focus on the incident branches H+, Q+,
and QH+ and construct the breakpoint graphs G(H,
QH), G(Q, QH), and G(QH, MRD). Figure S5 in Additional file 1 superimposes these three graphs and
(together with Table S4 in Additional file 1) illustrates
breakpoints that were inter-reused on the branches H
+, Q+, and QH+. Figure 12 shows the positions of
these recently affected breakpoints (projected to the
human genome) that, according to TFBM, represent
the best proxy for the currently active fragile regions
in the human genome. Various ongoing primate genome sequencing projects will soon result in an even
better estimate for the fragile regions in the human
genome.

Page 12 of 15

Conclusions
Since every species on Earth (including Homo sapiens)
may speciate into multiple new species, one can ask a
question: ‘How will the human genome evolve in the
next million years?’ TFBM suggests the putative sites of
future rearrangements in the human genome. The
answer to the question ‘Where are the (future) fragile
regions in the human genome?’ may be surprisingly simple: they are likely to be among the breakpoint regions
that were used in various primate lineages.
Nadeau and Taylor [2] proposed RBM based on a single observation: the exponential distribution of the
human-mouse synteny block sizes. There is no doubt
that jumping to this conclusion was not fully justified:
there are many other models (for example, FBM) that
lead to the same exponential distribution of the ‘visible’
synteny block sizes. Currently, there is no single piece of
evidence that would allow one to claim that RBM is correct and FBM is not.
While Pevzner and Tesler [3] revealed large breakpoint reuse (supporting FBM and contradicting RBM),
Ma et al. [33] revealed low breakpoint inter-reuse (contradicting FBM). This discovery calls for yet another
generalization of FBM. The proposed TFBM model not
only passes both ‘exponential length distribution’ test
(motivation for RBM) and ‘pairwise breakpoint reuse’
test (motivation for FBM) but also explains the puzzling
discovery of limited breakpoint inter-reuse in [33]. We
therefore argue that TFBM is a more accurate model of
chromosome evolution, allowing one to approximate the
currently active fragile regions in the human genome.
Needless to say, TFBM, similarly to RBM and FBM
(or various models of point mutations, for example,
Jukes-Cantor model), is a simplistic model of chromosome evolution that is only an approximation of the real
evolutionary process. Moreover, in the current paper we
considered TFBM only for the case of 2-breaks and did
not include other rearrangements such as transpositions.
However, it is fair to assume that transpositions are as
likely to happen on incident branches as on distant
branches, implying that they cannot possibly cause the
reduced breakpoint inter-reuse on distant branches. In
addition to limitations of TFBM as a model, there exists
a concern whether computation of empirical multispecies breakpoint reuse (that requires reconstruction of
ancestral genomes) may be affected by errors in reconstruction of ancestral genomes. While various tools for
ancestral genome reconstruction (such as MGRA [50]
and inferCARs [33]) were shown to be quite accurate
(in particular, they produce nearly identical results while
using very different algorithms), it is a challenging open
problem to evaluate the multispecies breakpoint reuse
without explicitly computing ancestral genomes.

Human Chromosomes

QH+ branches) projected to the human chromosomes.

The key point of this paper is the birth and death process of fragile regions rather than a specific model
aimed at estimating the hidden parameters of this process. TFBM is merely an initial and over-simplistic
attempt to estimate these parameters. The parameters
predicted by TFBM (for example, the number of active
fragile regions) are currently difficult to superimpose
with scarce information about rearrangements in only
seven reliably completed mammalian genomes, not
unlike the parameters of RBM derived in 1984 when no
high-resolution comparative mammalian genomic architectures were available. However, similarly to comparative mapping efforts in early 1990 s that confirmed the
Nadeau-Taylor estimates, we believe that imminent
sequencing of over 400 primate species will soon provide the detailed information about chromosomal fragility in human genome and will allow one to verify the
TFBM parameters.
Similarly to the discovery of breakpoint reuse in 2003
[3], there is currently only indirect evidence supporting

the birth and death of fragile regions in chromosome
evolution. However, we hope that, similarly to FBM
(that led to many follow-up studies supporting the existence of fragile regions), TFBM will trigger further
investigations of the fragile regions longevity.

Materials and methods
Computing multispecies breakpoint reuse in the TFBM
model

Let Fragile and Solid be the sets of n initial fragile
regions and m - n initial solid regions respectively. In
TFBM, the sets Fragile and Solid change in accordance
with the turnover rate x, that is, after every 2-break x
fragile regions (corresponding to 2x vertices in the
breakpoint graph) from Fragile are moved to Solid and
vice versa.
For a vertex in the set Fragile, we evaluate the probability P(l) that this vertex still belongs to Fragile after l
2-breaks. After every 2-break, a vertex from Fragile
moves to Solid with the probability x , while a vertex

the shortest branches, the theoretical curve approximates
the empirical R(l) curve well. The reason this ‘horizontal
trend’ is not seen in Figure 11 most likely explained by
the fact that H+ and Q+ branches in the corresponding
phylogenetic tree are rather short thus masking this
effect.

The difference between empirical and theoretical
estimates for R(l)

Figure S3 in Additional file 1 illustrates the results of
simulating of 400 2-breaks according to TFBM with
parameters m = 2, 000, n = 900, x = 1. As expected, the
theoretical curve and the curve derived from simulated
data (without sampling of various rearrangement scenarios) are nearly identical. We now assume that only five
out of 401 simulated genomes are available (after 0, 100,
200, 300, and 400 rearrangements) and use sampling of
rearrangement scenarios to compute the empirical R(l)
(Figure S3 in Additional file 1). One can see that empirical R(l) differs from the theoretical R(l), particularly for
small’. To understand why the empirical curve (obtained
via sampling of rearrangement scenarios) differs from
the theoretical curve, one has to realize that the multispecies breakpoint reuse test requires multiple genome
to reveal the ‘birth and death’ of fragile regions. Indeed, it
is impossible to detect this process from only two genomes: for example, sampling of rearrangement scenarios
on a single branch (simulated with TFBM with parameters described above) produces a nearly horizontal
