Abstract
Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCA) are a heterogeneous group of rare neurological
disorders involving both central and peripheral nervous system, and in some case other systems
and organs, and characterized by degeneration or abnormal development of cerebellum and spinal
cord, autosomal recessive inheritance and, in most cases, early onset occurring before the age of
20 years. This group encompasses a large number of rare diseases, the most frequent in Caucasian
population being Friedreich ataxia (estimated prevalence 2–4/100,000), ataxia-telangiectasia (1–2.5/
100,000) and early onset cerebellar ataxia with retained tendon reflexes (1/100,000). Other forms
ARCA are much less common. Based on clinicogenetic criteria, five main types ARCA can be
distinguished: congenital ataxias (developmental disorder), ataxias associated with metabolic
disorders, ataxias with a DNA repair defect, degenerative ataxias, and ataxia associated with other
features. These diseases are due to mutations in specific genes, some of which have been identified,
such as frataxin in Friedreich ataxia, α-tocopherol transfer protein in ataxia with vitamin E
deficiency (AVED), aprataxin in ataxia with oculomotor apraxia (AOA1), and senataxin in ataxia
with oculomotor apraxia (AOA2). Clinical diagnosis is confirmed by ancillary tests such as
neuroimaging (magnetic resonance imaging, scanning), electrophysiological examination, and
mutation analysis when the causative gene is identified. Correct clinical and genetic diagnosis is
important for appropriate genetic counseling and prognosis and, in some instances,
pharmacological treatment. Due to autosomal recessive inheritance, previous familial history of
affected individuals is unlikely. For most ARCA there is no specific drug treatment except for
coenzyme Q10 deficiency and abetalipoproteinemia.

Definition and classification

Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCA)

Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias (ARCA) belong to
the wider group disorders known as inherited ataxias [13]. ARCA are neurological disorders characterized by
degeneration or abnormal development of cerebellum
and spinal cord, autosomal recessive inheritance and, in
most cases, early onset occurring before the age of 20. This
group encompasses a large number of rare diseases, the
most frequent being Friedreich ataxia.

Different criteria have been used to classify ARCA and
issues of classification still remain controversial. In the
80s of the last century, Harding proposed a clinical classification for inherited ataxias based on two criteria: the age
of onset and pathological mechanisms [4,5]. Most of early
onset ataxias (before age of 20 years) show autosomal
recessive inheritance and may be classified as ARCA. Some
of them are not progressive disorders and are associated
with impaired development of the cerebellum and its connections; they were considered congenital ataxias. Other
have a metabolic cause and show either progressive or
intermittent natural history. The most frequent ataxias in
Harding classification were degenerative ataxias with
unknown cause. However, in the last ten years molecular
genetic studies have changed the global panorama of
inherited ataxias. Koenig has used topographical and
pathophysiological criteria for ARCA; he distinguished
sensory and spinocerebellar ataxias, cerebellar ataxias
with sensory-motor peripheral neuropathy and pure cerebellar ataxia [6]. Recently, the group of Filla suggested a
pathogenic approach to classify hereditary ataxias [7].
These authors did not consider any genetic, pathological
or natural history-based criteria, and divided the disorders
in mitochondrial ataxias (including Friedreich ataxia),
metabolic ataxias, ataxias associated with defective DNA
repair, ataxias with abnormal protein folding and degradation, ataxias caused by channelopathies, and a miscellaneous group with unknown pathogenic mechanisms.
In order to offer a clinically-oriented classification of
ARCA, we use here the classical criteria that take into
account both genetic inheritance and natural history of
the clinical symptoms. The Mendelian criterion allows to
consider ARCA as a group of inherited ataxias (including
most of the congenital non-progressive ataxias), which
differ either from the group of autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (late onset spinocerebellar ataxias and episodic ataxias) or the small group of X-linked ataxias.
Consequently, we propose a classification of ARCA as follows: 1) congenital or developmental ataxias; 2) metabolic ataxias, including ataxias caused by enzymatic
defects; 3) ataxia due to DNA repair defects; 4) degenerative and progressive ataxic disorders that include ataxias
with known cause and pathogenesis (such as Friedreich
ataxia), and ataxias of unknown etiology; 5) ARCA with
additional features (Table 1). It should be pointed out
that this classification is conditioned by the current and
rapidly evolving knowledge on the molecular mechanisms of ataxia. This is especially important for the development of new treatments based on the knowledge of the
pathogenesis of disease.

Etiology
Autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias are Mendelian
inherited disorders. Every disease belonging to this group

http://www.OJRD.com/content/1/1/47

is caused by mutations in a specific gene. Some of ARCA
show genetic heterogeneity due to mutation(s) in more
that one gene/locus (Table 1).

Clinical description
1. Congenital (developmental) ataxias
Some rare developmental anomalies, such as dysgenesis
or agenesis of the vermis, cerebellar hemispheres or parts
of the brainstem, may give rise to congenital ataxias, and
most of them are associated with an autosomal recessive
inheritance. In the last years, some congenital ataxias such
as Joubert syndrome have also been associated with specific chromosomal loci and genes.
Joubert syndrome
Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is a rare autosomal recessive
brain disorder characterized by i) absence of cerebellar
vermis and ii) presense of "molar tooth sign" (MTS). MTS
is formed by abnormal configuration of the superior cerebellar peduncles (SCPs) that connect the cerebellum to
the midbrain and thalamus. The most common clinical
manifestations include infantile onset of cerebellar ataxia,
nystagmus, vertical gaze paresis, ptosis, retinopathy, mental retardation, and episodic hypernea or apnea of the
newborn. There is agenesis of cerebellar vermis. Most of
the approximately 200 patients reported to date have
additional clinical features associated with those of the
classical JBTS. The related clinical features define a large
spectrum of syndromes with MTS (such as Senior-Löken
syndrome), which (together with JBTS) are termed Joubert syndrome related disorders (JSRD) or MTS related
syndromes [8,9]. To date, five loci associated with JBTS
have been mapped to chromosomes 9q34.3 (JBTS1),
11p11.2-q12.3 (JBTS2), 6q23 (JBTS3), 2q13 (JBTS4), and
12q21 (JBTS5) [10-13]. Mutations in the AHI1 gene have
been reported in three JBTS3-linked families presenting
with a pure cerebellar phenotype [14]. Moreover, the
NPHP1 gene deletion associated with juvenile nephonophthisis has been identified in subjects affected by a
mild form of JBTS [15,16]. Recently, mutations in the
CEP290 gene have been found both in patients with JBTS5
[17] and nephronopthisis [18]. CEP290 or NPHP6
encodes for nephrocystin-6, a centrosomal protein that
modulates the activity of ATF4, a transcription factor
implicated in the cAMP-dependent renal cyst formation.
Cayman cerebellar ataxia
Cayman cerebellar ataxia is another congenital ataxia for
which the causative gene has been identified. Individuals
with Cayman ataxia have hypotonia from birth, psychomotor delay and non-progressive cerebellar dysfunction,
including truncal and limb ataxia, dysarthria, nystagmus,
and intention tremor. Imaging studies show cerebellar
hypoplasia. The disease has been observed in an isolated
population of the Grand Cayman Island; it is caused by

2. Metabolic ataxias
Metabolic ataxias include:

• progressive ataxias;

Page 3 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2006, 1:47

• disorders associated with intermittent ataxia (e.g. syndromes with hyperammonemias, aminoacidurias, and
disorders of pyruvate and lactate metabolism);
• metabolic disorders in which ataxia occurs as a minor
feature (e.g. metachromatic leukodystrophy, adrenoleukodystrophy, and sphingomyelin storage disorders).
Here we just mention some of the most relevant progressive ataxia involving metabolism.
Ataxia with isolated vitamin E deficiency
Ataxia with isolated vitamin E deficiency (AVED) [21] is a
hereditary ataxia caused by mutations in the α-tocopherol
transfer protein gene, α-TTP [22,23]. AVED has been
described in primary metabolic defects such as abetalipoproteinemia, or secondary to fat malabsortion, chronic
cholestasis, pancreatic insufficiency, or cystic fibrosis. In
AVED, the unique biochemical abnormality is the very
low plasma level of vitamin E, and respectively, the low
level of the unique form of vitamin E present in the mammalian serum, RRR-α-tocopherol.

α-TTP is the protein responsible for the specific transfer of
vitamin E to the nascent very low-density lipoproteins
(VLDL). Patients with AVED have normal vitamin E
absorbtion in the intestine, but poor conservation of
plasma RRR-α-tocopherol due to impaired secretion of
RRR-α-tocopherol in VLDL; thus VLDL represent the primary defect in the pathogenesis of the disease.
AVED is characterized by progressive sensory and cerebellar ataxia usually beginning before age of 20 years (range
2–52 years). Patients with AVED show clinical signs similar to those in Friedreich ataxia, including gait and limb
ataxia, dysarthria, lower limb areflexia, loss of vibration
and positional sense, and bilateral Babinski sign. In contrast, cardiomyopathy and glucose intolerance are much
less frequent, and head titubation and dystonia are
observed in some patients only. Diagnosis is based on the
finding of low serum vitamin E values (< 2.5 mg/L; normal values 6–15 mg/L) in absence of malabsortion. In
contrast to abetalipoproteinemia, AVED patients have a
normal lipidogram and normal red blood cell morphology with no acantocytes. Electrophysiological studies
show signs of axonal sensory neuropathy with moderate
reduction of sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) and
normal motor nerve conduction velocities. Electromyogram is either normal or neurogenic, with polyphasic
recordings [24,25].
AVED is particularly frequent in countries from the Mediterranean basin and most of cases come from North African populations. The 744delA frameshift mutation is the
most frequently found defect and is distributed as a result

http://www.OJRD.com/content/1/1/47

of a founder effect [23]. The most frequent mutation identified in the Japanese population is an amino acid substitution, H101Q, associated with a mild phenotype
[26,27].
Treatment is based on vitamin E supplements. Administration to adults of 800 mg RRR-α-tocopherol twice daily
leads to an increased plasma levels of α-tocopherol and
reduction of symptoms and signs.
Abetalipoproteinemia
Abetalipoproteinemia or Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is
an autosomal recessive inherited inborn error of lipoprotein metabolism caused by molecular abnormalities in
the microsomal trygliceride transfer protein (MTP),
whose gene maps to chromosome 4q22-q24 [28-31]. The
MTP catalyzes the transport of triglyceride, cholesteryl
ester and phospholipid between phospholipid surfaces.
Thus, the assembly or secretion of plasma lipoproteins
that contain apolipoprotein B is thought to be the basic
pathogenetic defect.

Clinical features include malabsorption syndrome, pigmentary degeneration of the retina and progressive ataxic
neuropathy. Red cells show a peculiar "thorny" deformation called acanthocytosis. The neurological symptoms
are directly related to the deficiency of liposoluble vitamin
E. Total cholesterol is low (<70 mg/dL) and triglycerides
are almost undetectable. Lipoprotein profile is characterized by absent low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and VLDL.
Symptoms observed in some patients with abetalipoproteinemia are indistinguishable from those of patients with
homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia (HBLP), a codominant genetic disorder characterized by decreased or
absent plasma levels of apolipoprotein (apo) B, due to
mutations in the apo B gene (chromosome 2p24) [32,33]
(for review see [34]).
Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis
Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) or sterol 27hydroxylase deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder
characterized by defect in bile acid biosynthesis and storage of sterols, and early childhood onset. It has been
reported in approximately 200 people worldwide,
although the prevalence seems higher in Sephardic Jewish
of Moroccan origin [35]. Clinical characteristics include
xanthomas of the Achilles and other tendons, juvenile cataracts, early atherosclerosis and progressive neurological
disorder with cerebellar ataxia beginning after puberty, as
well as systemic spinal cord involvement and dementia.
Intelligence is low to normal. Large deposits of cholesterol
and cholestanol are found in virtually all tissues, particularly in Achilles tendon, brain and lungs. CTX shares some
clinical manifestations (including xanthomas and coronary atherosclerosis) with other lipid storage disorders

Page 4 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2006, 1:47

such as familial hypercholesterolemia and phytosterolemia. However, progressive neurologic symptoms, cataracts and mild pulmonary insufficiency distinguish CTX
from these two disorders [36].
The disease is caused by mutations in the sterol 27hydroxylase gene (CYP27) mapped to chromosome 2q33qter [37]. Approximately 40 different mutations of the
CYP27 gene have been identified in CTX patients from
various populations. Most of mutations are related to the
adrenodoxin-binding site and the heme-binding site,
although the location of some mutations suggests other
putative binding sites to other proteins [38]. The CYP27
gene encodes for a mitochondrial cytochrome P-450,
which hydroxylates a variety of sterols at C27 position, in
association with two protein cofactors, adrenodoxin and
adrenodoxin reductase. In the bile acid synthesis pathway,
sterol 27-hydroxylase catalyzes the first step in the oxidation of the side chain of sterol intermediates. In CTX,
cholestanol (5-alpha-dihydro derivative of cholesterol)
has elevated concentrations in all tissues (compared to
cholesterol). Diagnosis is made by demonstrating abnormal values of cholestanol in serum and tendons. Plasma
cholesterol may be low or normal.
Treatment with cholic acid or chenodeoxycholic acid is
indicated. Other treatments include the use of pravastin, a
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor, or the combination of both chenodeoxycholic acid
and pravastin (for review see [39]).
Refsum disease
Refsum disease (also named phytanic acid oxidase deficiency, heredopathia atactica polyneuritiformis or hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy IV (HMSN IV), is a
rare inherited disorder characterized by defective peroxisomal alpha oxidation of the fatty acids. This defect
impairs the metabolism of branched chain fatty acids like
phytanic acid (Phyt) and, as a consequence, Phyt accumulates in the blood and other tissues.

The age of onset varies from early childhood to 50 years of
age, but most patients have clear-cut manifestations
before age of 20 years. The three main clinical features are
retinitis pigmentosa, chronic polyneuropathy, and cerebellar ataxia. Most of cases have anosmia, deafness, cardiac arrhythmias, bony and skin abnormalities.
Other peroxisome biogenesis disorders associated with
high levels of Phyt are Zellweger syndrome, neonatal
adrenoleukodystrophy, infantile Refsum disease, and rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata. The first three of
them represent a continuum of overlapping features, the
most severe being the Zellweger syndrome, and the less

http://www.OJRD.com/content/1/1/47

severe infantile Refsum disease. Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata is characterized by a distinct phenotype.
Refsum disease is an autosomal recessive trait that is
genetically heterogenous. The PHYH (or PAHX) gene
placed on chromosome 10pter-p11.2 is responsible for
the disorder in most of patients [40]. The PHYH gene
spans 21 Kb, contains nine exons and encodes for the
phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase (PhyH) that catalyses the first
step in the alpha oxidation of Phyt. Thus, in the majority
of patients with Refsum disease, PhyH activity is deficient
[41,42]. Different types of mutations have been found distributed along the PHYH gene [43]. Recently, Kahlert et al.
[44] have suggested that the cytotoxic effect of Phyt seems
to be related to a combination of effects on Ca2+ regulation, mitochondrial depolarization and increased reactive
oxygen species (ROS) generation in brain cells.
A second locus involved in Refsum disease is the PEX7
gene (chromosome 6q21-q22.2) that consists of 10 exons
(102 Kb) [45,46]. To date, only three Refsum patients
have been reported with mutations in this gene; mutations in the PEX7 gene have been found causative for
other disorders, such as rhizomelic chondrodysplasia
punctata [47]. PEX genes encode for peroxisomal assembly proteins called peroxins, which are required for the
import of matrix proteins into peroxisomes.
3. DNA repair defects
Ataxia-telangiectasia
Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) is a multisystem disease characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor
apraxia, oculocutaneous teleangiectasia, coreoathetosis,
recurrent sinopulmonary infections, variable immunodeficiency state with involvement of cellular and humoral
immunity, high risk of malignancy (especially leukemia
and lymphoma), and enhanced sensitivity to ionizing
radioactivity. It is the more common autosomal recessive
ataxia after Friedreich ataxia, with an estimated prevalence
of 1–2.5/100,000. In most of the cases, the disease begins
at age of 2 to 4 years, the first symptom being cerebellar
ataxia. Oculomotor signs are present is almost all patients.
Teleangiectasias are the second hallmark of the disorder
and appear between age of 2 and 8 years. Cerebellar
degeneration is progressive until adulthood and patients
need a wheelchair by the age of 10. Lifespan is reduced but
quality of life has improved and patients survive more
than 20 years of age (some of them survive into their 40s
and 50s) (for review see [48]). Neuropathologic studies
show an atrophic cerebellum, predominantly throughout
the vermis and less in the lobules. There is reduced
number and abnormal arborisation of Purkinje cells, and
marked thinning of the molecular layer and granular
layer.

Classical complementation experiments on fibroblasts
culture from patients suggested that there were a number
of genes implicated in the diseases pathogenesis. However, linkage studies showed only one locus on chromosome 11q23 accounting for the disease in different
populations [49,50]. Mutation analysis of the ATM gene
has confirmed the genetic homogeneity of A-T. The gene
has 66 exons spanning more than 150 kb. A transcript of
12 kb encodes a protein of 3056 amino acids with 370
kDa, which is a member of the phosphoinositol-3 kinase
(PI-3K)-like serine/threonine kinases involved in the cell
cycle checkpoint control and DNA repair [51,52]. More
than 200 distinct mutations have been reported associated with A-T. Mutations are distributed throughout the
entire gene and involve almost all coding exons [53]. Most
of patients are compound heterozygous for mutations
that give truncated proteins, although missense mutations
can alter the protein function [54]. Some A-T cases have
atypical clinical manifestations with a milder phenotype
that present one or more of the following symptoms: later
onset of the first symptoms, slower progression, longer
lifespan, and lower levels of chromosomal instability and
cellular radiosensitivity [55]. These patients are usually
compound heterozygous for a more severe mutation with
a milder mutation that makes possible the expression of a
small amount of protein [56,57]. As the majority of
patients carry unique mutations, mutation analysis is possible for the clinical diagnosis of A-T. When the mutation
is unknown or sequence analysis is not available, prenatal
diagnosis is based on linkage analysis using flanking
linked markers.
Diagnosis is suspected in young children who show signs
of cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor apraxia and telangiectasias of the conjunctivae. Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) examination shows cerebellum atrophy. Other
tests that may support the diagnosis are: serum alpha-fetoprotein is elevated above 10 ng/ml in more than 90% of
patients; cytogenetic analysis shows a 7:14 translocation
(t [7;14] [q11;q32]) in 5–15% of affected individuals; colony in vitro assay (irradiation of colony formation of lymphoblastoid cells) is a very sensitive test but takes
approximately three months and is available only in specialized centres. Mutation analysis (available in specialized laboratories only) deserves a special attention as it is
not only useful to confirm the clinical diagnosis but is
also useful for carrier detection, genetic counseling and
prenatal diagnosis.
Ataxia-telangiectasia-like disorder
Ataxia telangectasia-like disorder (ATLD) is a very rare
syndrome that shares similarities with A-T and Nijmegen
breakage syndrome. Patients' cells show chromosomal
instability, increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation,
defective induction of stress-activated signal transduction

http://www.OJRD.com/content/1/1/47

pathways, and radioresistant DNA synthesis [58,59]. The
causative gene, MRE11A, maps very close to ATM (chromosome 11q), thus only a very detailed linkage analysis
would separate ATLD from A-T purely on the basis of
genetic data [57].
Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia 1
Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia 1 (AOA1) is characterized
by early onset gait ataxia (between 2 and 6 years of age),
dysarthria, limb dysmetria (later in disease course), oculomotor apraxia, distal and symmetric muscle weakness and
wasting, mild loss of vibration and joint position sense,
and slow progression. Some patients show dystonia,
masked facies or mental retardation. Laboratory studies
show a motor and sensory axonal neuropathy, mild loss
of large myelinated axons, cerebellar and brainstem atrophy on MRI, hypoalbuminemia and hypercholesterolemia [60,61]. The disease has been originally reported in
Portuguese [61] and Japanese [62] patients. In Japan,
AOA1 seems to be the most frequent recessive ataxia,
whereas in Portugal it is the second one, after Friedreich
ataxia [63].

The causative APTX gene, located on chromosome
9p13.3, has seven exons and encodes a novel protein,
aprataxin [64]. Alternative splicing in exon 3 generates
two distinct isoforms, the longer transcript encodes for a
342 amino acid protein, while the shorter one encodes a
174 amino acid protein. Aprataxin is a nuclear protein
composed of three domains that share homology with the
amino-terminal domain of polynucleotide kinase 3'phosphatase (PNKP), histidine-triad (HIT) proteins and
DNA-binding C2H2 zinc-finger proteins, respectively.
PNKP is involved in DNA single-strand break repair
(SSBR) following exposure to ionizing radiation and ROS
[65]. Recently, involvement of aprataxin in the DNA
sSSBR-machinery has been demonstrated [66]. Thus,
AOA1 may be classified within the group of ataxias associated with DNA repair defects. Due to its capacity to
interact with proteins involved in DNA repair, aprataxin
could influence the cellular response to genotoxic stress
[67].
Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia 2
Ataxia with oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2), also
referred as non-Friedreich spinocerebellar ataxia type 1
(SCAR1), is an autosomal recessive disorder that represents approximately 8% of non-Friedreich ARCA [68]. It is
characterized by spinocerebellar ataxia with onset
between 11 and 22 years, choreoathetosis, dystonic posturing with walking, and is occasionally associated with
oculomotor apraxia, and elevated values of gamma-globulin, alpha-protein and creatin kinase (CK) [68]. Cerebellar atrophy is observed in some patients.

Electrophysiology studies show absence of sensory potentials.
The causative gene has been mapped to chromosome
9q34. The gene has recently been isolated and characterized [69]. It encodes senataxin (SETX), a 2,677-amino
acid protein that contains at its C-terminus a classic 7motif domain found in the superfamily 1 of helicases.
Senataxin may act in the DNA repair pathway and also
may be a nuclear RNA helicase with a role in the splicing
machinery [69]. No evidence of chromosome instability
or sensitivity to ionizing radiation has been observed in
cells from affected individuals. Mutations in SETX gene
have been identified also in the autosomal dominant
form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as ALS4
[70].
Spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy
Spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1)
is a disorder characterized by recessive ataxia with peripheral axonal motor and sensory neuropathy, distal muscular atrophy, and pes cavus and stepagge gait, as described
in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Genetic studies in a large
Saudi Arabian family mapped the disease to chromosome
14q31 and identified a homozygous mutation in the gene
encoding topoisomerase I-dependent DNA damage repair
enzyme (TDP1) [71]. Patients had history of seizures,
mild brain atrophy, mild hypercholesterolemia and borderline hypoalbuminemia.
Xeroderma pigmentosum
Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a clinical syndrome with
multiple complementation groups and genotypes [72],
inherited as an autosomal recessive trait [73]. The prevalence in the United States is approximately 1:250,000,
and higher frequency is estimated in Japan and the Mediterranean areas [74]. XP is characterized by a variable neurological syndrome (including ataxia, choreoathetosis,
spasticity, deafness, and progressive mental retardation),
skin photosensitivity, early onset skin cancers, telangectasia, photophobia, conjunctivitis, keratitis, ectropion and
entropion. It is typical to observe defective DNA repair
after ultraviolet damage of culture cells.

The disease is genetically heterogeneous and has been
classified into seven complementation groups, XPA-XPG,
and each complementation group has a specific entry in
the MIM database. Eight genes have been identified
among XP patients [72]: seven, XPA-XPG, are involved in
nucleotide excision repair (NER) and one, the XP variant,
is involved in replication of damaged DNA of the leading
strand [75].

4. Degenerative and progressive ARCA
In the last ten years causative genes and pathogenic mechanisms have been described for a number of degenerative
and progressive ARCA. This is particularly relevant for
Friedreich ataxia, the most common inherited ataxia in
the Caucasian population. The defective protein in Friedreich ataxia, frataxin, is a small protein of the mitochondrial matrix for which several functions in the
mitochondria have been proposed. However, there are
another ataxic syndromes caused by defective mitochondrial proteins encoded by the nuclear genome. These
include the X-linked sideroblastic anemia with ataxia
caused by mutations in the ABC7 gene, the infantile onset
spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA), and the recently
described mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome
(MIRAS).
Friedreich ataxia
Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) has been first described by the
German pathologist Nicolaus Friedreich in nine members, two females and seven males of three sibships, in a
series of five papers between 1863 and 1877 [4]. The
author observed onset around puberty and presence of
ataxia, dysarthria, sensory loss, muscle weakness, scoliosis, foot deformity and cardiac symptoms. After description of tendon reflexes by Erb in 1875, Friedreich also
recognized the absence of these reflexes as a feature of the
disease. For a number of decades, FRDA and the other
forms of inherited ataxias have undergone a large debate
about their clinical definition and classification. Geoffroy
et al. in 1976 [76] and Harding in 1981 [77] proposed
restricted clinical criteria for FRDA diagnosis. Harding
defined essential diagnostic criteria including age of onset
of symptoms before 25 years, progressive ataxia of limbs
and of gait, absent knee and ankle reflexes, extensor
plantar responses, dysarthria, and motor nerve conduction velocity >40 m.s-1 in upper limbs with small or absent
sensory action potentials. Most patients also show pyramidal weakness, absence of reflexes in upper limbs, distal
loss of joint position and sense in lower limbs, scoliosis
and abnormal electrocardiogram suggesting the presence
of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Other signs are pes
cavus, nystagmus, optic atrophy, deafness, and diabetes
mellitus or glucose intolerance. Mapping the FRDA locus
allowed to define new clinical variants that involved the
main clinical criteria. The isolation of the FRDA gene and
description of the GAA trinucleotide expansion as the
main mutation have allowed to define the clinical picture
and the phenotypic variability based on biological markers [78-80] (Table 2).
Genetics and the FRDA gene
Friedreich ataxia is inherited as an autosomal recessive
trait. Originally, only one locus has been recognized and
mapped to chromosome 9q13 [81]. However, a rare sec-

(a) The series is based on clinical diagnosis.
(b) and (c) Data are based on genetic diagnosis (patients homozigotes for the GAA expansion)

ond locus, FRDA2, has been proposed for some families
not linked to chromosome 9 [82-84]. The FRDA gene
spans 80 kb of genomic DNA and is composed by seven
exons. A major 1.3 kb transcript is encoded by exons 1-5a
and translated in a 210 amino acids protein, called
frataxin [85]. A second putative transcript uses exon 5b
instead of 5a followed by exon 6, but no function has yet
been described.
Human mRNA frataxin is mainly expressed in spinal cord
and heart, but a signal on Northern blots is also found in
liver, skeletal muscle and pancreas [85]. These data correlate with the clinical presentation of the disease. Expression studies in mice (embryo and adult) confirmed the
relation between the main affected tissues and frataxin
expression. In embryos, expression starts in the neuroepithelium at embryonic day E10.5. Dorsal root ganglia,
where the bipolar sensory cell bodies are located, are the
major expression site in the nervous system, from day
E14.5 to adult life. In developing mice, frataxin is also
expressed in spinal cord, periventricular zone of the brain
at the level of diencephalon, including cerebral cortex and
the ganglionic eminence, and of the posterior mesencephalon. Non-neurological expression involves energydependent tissues such heart, liver, pancreas and brown
adipose tissue that contain high density of mitochondria
[86].

Molecular pathology
The most frequent mutation observed in FRDA patients is
the expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat. The GAA
tract is located within an Alu element belonging to the Sx
subfamily in the first intron of the gene. Ninety six percent
of patients are homozygous for GAA repeat expansions,
and the remaining 4% are compound heterozygous for an
expanded allele and a point mutation within the coding
sequence of the gene [84,86]. Size of the mutated GAA
expansion is variable between 67 to 1700 repeats.

The expanded GAA repeat results in inhibition of the
FRDA gene expression. Reduced levels of both mRNA [85]
and protein [88] have been demonstrated in tissue samples obtained from Friedreich's ataxia patients. The reduction is inversely related to the size of the GAA repeat
alleles, especially to the smaller one. Long uninterrupted
GAA tracts adopt triple helical structures, which can form
bimolecular complexes or 'sticky' DNA formed by the
association of two purine-purine-pyramidine structures
[89]. Triplexes may inhibit transcription, thus providing a
mechanism to explain reduced gene expression in patients
[90,91].
Point mutations predicting a truncated frataxin and missense mutations have been reported [85,92-99]. Most
missense mutations involved the C-terminal half of

Page 8 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2006, 1:47

frataxin (a region better preserved in the phylogeny), suggesting that it is an important functional domain
[100,101]. A number of missense mutations, L106S,
D122Y, G130V, R165P, R165C and L182F, have been
associated with milder and atypical clinical pictures in
heterozygous patients. In most of them, the amino acid
substitution is located before or after the highly conserved
domain of the C-terminal frataxin. In these cases, it is
likely that the less severe phenotype may be caused by a
partially functional frataxin encoded by the nonexpanded
allele. However, some of these amino acid changes may
affect a relevant residue in the function of frataxin: one
substitution involved G130 (a residue also preserved in
most of the analysed species); D122 is one of the surface
sites of the acidic patch, which may be important in a
putative protein-protein interaction of frataxin. No mutations have been reported to involve amino acids of the
peptide signal sequence, except for the first methionine
[96,97], something that may be related to the absence of
specific function of the N-terminal half of frataxin. Mutations in the start translation amino acid might reduce the
protein production. A summary of the possible effects of
missense point mutations on frataxin function (based on
protein structure studies) has been reported elsewhere
[102].
Clinical variability and molecular diagnosis
The phenotype of Friedreich ataxia does not show the
homogeneity observed for other recessive traits. A number
of phenotypes showing a variation in some essential clinical criteria of the classic FRDA have been mapped to the
same locus on chromosome 9. These include the late
onset Friedreich ataxia (LOFA) defined by onset after 25
years [103,104], FRDA with retained reflexes (FARR)
[105], and the Acadian form of FRDA [106] that is characterized by slower progression rate, with no cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus. Analysis of the GAA repeat in
these patients has confirmed FRDA diagnosis. Other
unexpected presentations of FRDA (confirmed by molecular diagnosis) are pure sensory ataxia [107], spastic paraplegia [108,109] and chorea [110]. Altogether, diagnostic
criteria by Geoffrey et al. [76] and Harding [77] remain
highly specific for diagnosis of FRDA, although a few cases
may be underdiagnosed when molecular diagnosis is not
performed, especially those with a very late onset [111].

A correlation between the size of the GAA expansion, and
the presence and timing of various features of the disease
has been established. The most evident is the inverse correlation between the age of onset and the size of the
smaller allele [78,79,87,112]. This correlation is not only
observed with the size of the expanded allele but also with
the amount of residual frataxin in lymphocytes from
patients [88].

http://www.OJRD.com/content/1/1/47

The high frequency (98%) of the GAA expansion in FRDA
chromosomes makes its analysis a very helpful tool in the
diagnosis of classic and variant FRDA, and in other early
onset spinocerebellar ataxias. Finding two expanded GAA
alleles confirms the diagnosis FRDA, whatever the phenotype, whereas a heterozygous genotype of one expanded
and one non-expanded alleles is highly suggestive of
FRDA. In this case, search for a point mutation is mandatory to confirm the diagnosis.
Genetic counseling is supported by the molecular diagnosis. Before the identification of the FRDA gene, prenatal
diagnosis was based on segregation analysis of flanking
linked markers in the fetal DNA of mutations found in the
proband, which required DNA from both parents [113].
To date, prenatal diagnosis is feasible by direct analysis of
the GAA repeat, and in very rare cases, the GAA repeat and
point mutations [114]. Assuming a carrier rate in the Caucasian general population of 1:100 (2% of mutations
being point mutations), prior risk for a patient to have an
affected child is 1:200. By contrast, the risk is 1:10,000 if
the GAA repeat is excluded in the partner. For carrier relatives, the risk to have an affected child if the partner has
not a GAA expansion is 1:20,000.
Mitochondria and pathogenesis
Frataxin is a soluble protein with no previously known
function. No specific domains related to protein families
are represented in its polypeptide sequence. The protein is
localized in the mitochondrial internal membrane [88],
where it is processed by the mitochondrial processing
peptidase (MPP) to produce the mature form with 18 kDa
in a two-step process [115,116], and in the mitochondrial
matrix.

Experiments in cell systems, especially in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have provided relevant information
about the possible function of frataxin in mitochondria
and its role in the pathogenesis of the disease. At least five
hypotheses for the primary mitochondrial function of
frataxin have been proposed (see [117] for review): iron
transport [118-120], iron-sulfur clusters (ISC) biosynthesis [121,122], iron storage [123,124], antioxidant
[125,126] and stimulator of oxidative phosphorylation
[127]. Some of them are discussed bellow.
The first biochemical data coming from experiments in S.
cerevisae yeast suggested a role of the frataxin homologue
gene, YFH1, and its encoded protein Yfh1p, in the general
regulation of iron homeostasis. Knock-out yeast strains,
ΔYFH1, accumulate iron in mitochondria at the expense
of cytosolic iron, leading to lost of ability to carry out oxidative phosphorylation. It is thought that decreased respiratory activity and mitochondrial damage are the
consequence of iron-induced oxygen radicals generated

Page 9 of 19
(page number not for citation purposes)

Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2006, 1:47

by the Fenton reaction (Fe2+-catalyzed production of
hydroxyl radicals). Data from human studies suggested
that yeast model may reflect the Friedreich ataxia pathophysiology since there is an accumulation of iron deposits
in myofibrils of the heart from patients' autopsies [128],
and increased iron levels in mitochondria of patients'
fibroblasts [129,130]. Moreover, a reduced activity of
both mitochondrial and cytosolic aconitase and complexes I, II and III have been observed in heart biopsy of
two patients [121] and autopsy material of nine patients
[122]. These enzymes and complexes contain iron-sulfur
(Fe-S) clusters, ISC, in their active sites. Proteins containing ISC are sensitive to free oxygen radicals and may be
affected by accumulation of mitochondrial iron in
frataxin deficiency states.
In contrast, data from frataxin knock-out mouse models
has raised some questions about the role of iron in the disease pathogenesis. Complete absence of frataxin in mouse
leads to early embryonic lethality. Interestingly, no iron
deposits are detected when embryos are stained with Perls
technique [131]. Two conditional knock-outs in specific
mouse tissues have also been reported [132]. The authors
induced both striated muscle-restricted (MCK mutant)
and neuron-restricted (NSE mutant) transgenic animals
harbouring a frataxin exon 4 deletion. Both mutant strains
together reproduce many aspects of the pathophysiology
of the disease, such as cardiac hypertrophy without skeletal muscle involvement and large sensory neuron dysfunction. Deficient activities of complexes I-III of the
respiratory chain and the aconitases have also been
observed. However, intramitochondrial iron accumulation is time-dependent in the MCK mutant: whereas deficit of Fe-S enzymes is detected in the 7-weeks mutant
mouse, mitochondrial deposit of iron is not observed
until 10 weeks of age, suggesting that mitochondrial iron
accumulation does not represent the primary causative
pathogenic mechanism in frataxin deficiencies.
Frataxin is believed to have a function in the biogenesis of
ISC. The above mentioned studies suggest that iron accumulation is a distal consequence of an earlier, proximal
consequence of frataxin deficiency. It has been now
clearly established that the mitochondrial iron accumulation is a general consequence of deficiencies in ISC biogenesis in yeast models [133]. Recently, deficiency of the
yeast frataxin homolog protein yfh1p has been demonstrated to cause a partial defect in the maturation of mitochondrial ISC [134]. Two recent reports have
demonstrated in vitro and in vivo interactions between
yeast frataxin and Isu1p, the ISC scaffold protein, suggesting a main role of frataxin in the biogenesis of mitochondrial ISC [135,136]. Expression experiments using
microarray technology on frataxin-deficient human cells
suggest that frataxin may have a role in the ISC biogenesis

http://www.OJRD.com/content/1/1/47

and sulphur amino acid metabolism [137]. Direct or indirect role of frataxin in the ISC biogenesis may account for
the biochemical phenotype observed in patient endomyocardial biopsies [121], or ROS generation. Recent studies
showed that yeast frataxin increases the iron bioavailability for heme synthesis [138] and also plays a role in aconitase chaperoning [139].
Another hypothesis (based on experiments in mammalian adipocyte cells that overexpressed frataxin) suggested
frataxin as an activator of mitochondrial energy conversion and oxidative phosphorylation [127]. The authors
have observed a Ca2+-induced up-regulation of tricarboxylic acid cycle flux and respiration, and an increase in the
cellular ATP content. They postulated ATP deficiency as a
primary defect rather than an alteration in the mitochondrial iron homeostasis, which would be a secondary associated phenomenon. This pathogenic mechanism is in
agreement with the finding of increased ATP production
in postexercise skeletal muscle from FRDA patients [140].
Further experiments showing direct participation of
frataxin in the respiratory chain (by interaction with protein of complex II) suggested FRDA as an oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) disease [141,142].
A common point in the cell damage and death in Friedreich ataxia is thought to be the generation of free radicals
and ROS. However, it has been shown that the deficiency
of frataxin in a new mouse knock-out model of Friedreich
ataxia does not cause oxidative stress [143]. Thus, the role
of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of the disease
remains to be elucidated; moreover, the use of antioxidants is based on this hypothesis.
Therapeutic advances
Understanding the underlying pathogenetical mechanisms of the disease is needed to design new pharmacological therapeutic approaches. A number of drugs trying
to reduce the effects of the oxidative stress (caused by
intracelullar iron imbalance due to frataxin deficiency)
have been introduced in the clicical practice. Both iron
chelators (desferrioxamine) and antioxidants (ascorbic
acid or coenzyme Q10 analogues) have been proposed to
reduce the mitochondrial iron overload. Desferroxiamine
has been used in patients with general iron overload.
However, Friedriech's ataxia patients have normal plasma
levels of iron and ferritin [144], although the plasma level
of the transferrin receptor is increased [145]. Moreover,
desferroxiamine is effective in chelating iron in the extracellular fluid and cytosol, but not in mitochondria. Thus,
the usage of this chelator in FRDA remains limited and
needs to be further defined.

Rustin et al. [146] studied in vitro the effect of desferrioxamine, ascorbic acid and idebenone on heart homoge-

Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases 2006, 1:47

nates from three Friedreich's ataxia patients with valvular
stenosis. Respiratory-chain complex II activity, lipoperoxidation, and mitochondrial and cytosolic aconitase activities have been tested in the presence of reduced iron
(Fe2+), oxidazed iron (Fe3+), desferrioxamine, ascorbic
acid, and idebenone. The authors observed decreased
activity of complex II and increased lipoperoxidation in
the presence of Fe2+ but not Fe3+. Presence of idebenone
protected complex II activity against iron-induced injury
in membrane lipids. However, reduction of Fe3+ by ascorbic acid produced peroxidation of lipids. In the same
experimental system, desferrioxamine protected complex
II activity from iron injury. In contrast, Fe2+ decreased the
aconitase activity when the chelator was present. In these
experiment protocols, only idebenone (a short-chain quinone), protected the heart homogenates from ironinduced injury. Consequently, authors investigated the
effect of idebenone in three patients that received idebenone (5 mg/kg daily, in three doses) for a period of 4–
9 months and a reduction of the mass index in the left
heart ventricle was documented by echocardiography.
Further studies confirmed the improvement of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy by idebenone [147]. Lodi and
colleagues [148] have treated patients with coenzyme Q10
and vitamin E, and have observed in vivo improvement of
cardiac and skeletal muscle bioenergetics. Idebenone
seems to have beneficial effect in Friedreich ataxia patients
with cardiomyopathy but conclusive results are still not
available. No significant improvement of the neurological
symptoms has been observed. Longitudinal studies in this
respect are currently in progress.
Schulz and colleagues [149] have detected a 2.6-fold
increase of urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine
(8OH2'dG) in 33 FRDA subjects, suggesting that oxidative
DNA damage is also increased in these patients and that
the generation of ROS may contribute to the pathogenesis
of the disease. Eight of these 33 patients were treated
orally with idebenone 5 mg/kg/day for eight weeks.
Although no significant clinical improvement has been
observed, a significant reduction to normal urinary concentration of 8OH2'dG have been reported.
Other drug therapies recently postulated include recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO), which has a broad
neuroprotective and cardioprotective capacity. The use of
EPO in the treatment of Friedreich ataxia is based on the
increased in vitro frataxin expression in response to EPO
[150].
Mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome
Mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS) is
caused by mutations in the polymerase γ (POLG) gene,
considered to be the replicative polymerase for mitochondrial DNA [151]. Most patients with MIRAS have Finnish

http://www.OJRD.com/content/1/1/47

ancestry but patients from Norway, the United Kingdom
and Belgium have also been reported [152-154]. All
patients are homozygous for the triptophan-to-serine substitution at position 178 (W178S) associated in cis-position with the E1143G polymorphism. The median age of
onset is 28 years (range 5–41 years). Clinical picture may
be heterogeneous. The most common manifestations
include progressive gait unsteadiness, dysarthria,
decreased or absent deep-tendon reflexes in the lower
limbs, decreased vibration or joint position sense, nystagmus and other eye-movement abnormalities. Epilepsy
and neuropathy may be initial features. Some patients
may show mild to moderate cognitive impairment, involuntary movements may also be present.
Mutations in POLG gene have been associated with a
number of clinical phenotypes. First mutation in this gene
was reported in patients with autosomal dominant progressive external ophtalmoplegia (PEO) [155] but mutations have also been identified in patients manifesting
Alpers syndrome [156-158], SANDO (sensory ataxic neuropathy, dysarthria, and ophtalmoparesis) [159], and
other allelic phenotypes [151,152,155,160,161]. In fact,
there is a POLG syndrome that shows clinical allelic heterogeneity, which in some instances is manifested as an
autosomal recessive ataxic syndrome (MIRAS is one of
them).
Infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia
Infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia (IOSCA), described
in Finland, is characterized by a very early onset ataxia
(between 1 and 2 years), athetosis and reduced tendon
reflexes. Other features such as ophthalmoplegia, hearing
loss, and sensory neuropathy with progressive loss of
myelinated fibres in sural nerves, appear later in the disease course. Some patients show reduced mental capacity.
Patients are wheelchair-bound by teens. Neuroimaging
studies reveal cerebellar atrophy. This rare ataxia is caused
by mutations in the C10orf2 gene (chromosome 10q22.3q24.1) encoding Twinkle, a mitochondrial DNA-specific
helicase, and a rarer splicing variant Twinky [162]. Mutations in this gene have also been reported in individuals
with autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia [163].
Charlevoix-Saguenay spastic ataxia
Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay
(ARSACS) was originally described in the North-eastern
regions of Québec, Canada, in families of French ancestry
[164]. In this area, the incidence at birth and the carrier
rate was estimated at 1/1,932 live born infants and 1/22
inhabitants, respectively [164,165]. Clinical symptoms
are early onset (often at the very early age of 12 to 18
months), progressive spastic ataxia of all limbs with paraplegia, increased tendon reflexes, dysarthria, progressive

distal wasting, extensor plantar responses, reduced vibratory and positional senses, weak ankle reflexes, and horizontal gaze nystagmus with poor ocular pursuit.
Electrophysiological studies show axonal and demyelinating neuropathy. Atrophy of the superior cerebellar vermis
is always present. Retinal hypermyelinated fibers have
been observed in patients from Québec, but absent in
patients from France, Tunisia and Turkey.
The causative gene sacsin, SACS, maps to chromosome
13q11 [166,167]. It contains an unique very large exon of
12.7 kb encoding 11.5-kb transcript [168]. Two founder
mutations, a single-base deletion at position 6594
(g.6594delT) and a g.5354C>T nonsense mutation, have
been reported in individuals from North-eastern Québec.
Recently, new mutations have been described in Tunisian
[169], Italian [170,171], Japanese [172] and Spanish
[173] patients. The presence of heat-shock domains suggests a function for sacsin in chaperone-mediated protein
folding.
Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome
Marinesco-Sjögren syndrome (MSS) is a rare autosomal
recessive disorder with approximately 200 known cases
worldwide [174]. Disease onset occurs in infancy. Cardinal features of MSS are cerebellar ataxia, congenital cataracts, and retarded somatic and mental development
[175]. Dysarthria, nystagmus, muscle weakness and hypotonia are frequent symptoms. Areflexia is associated with
a demyelinating peripheral neuropathy. Some patients
show episodes of rhabdomyolysis with sustained or episodic elevation of serum creatin kinase activity. Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is a frequently associated
feature. Muscle pathology consists of myopathic changes
with rimmed vacuoles. Cerebellar cortical atrophy with
vacuolated or binuclear Purkinje cells is also observed. It
has been suggested that MSS with myoglobinuria and
congenital cataracts-facial dysmorphism-neuropathy
(CCFDN) syndromes are genetically identical, as they
both map to chromosome 18qter [176,177]. In contrast,
a locus for classical MSS has recently been assigned to
chromosome 5q31 and mutations have been identified in
the SIL1 gene (encoding a factor involved in the proper
protein folding) [178-180]. The loss of SIL1 function
results in accumulation of unfolded proteins, which are
harmful to the cell.

Diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms. Ophthalmologic examination should be performed to detect cataracts. MRI scan allows investigation of cerebellar atrophy
particularly involving the vermis. Muscle biopsy findings
are generally non-specific. Prenatal diagnosis with molecular genetic techniques can be performed in families with
know mutation. Treatment is symptomatic. Cataracts
often require surgical removal to preserve vision. Hormo-

http://www.OJRD.com/content/1/1/47

nal replacement therapy may be needed if hypogonadism
is present. Physical and occupational therapy are crucial.
Patients survive to old age, with varying disability.
Early onset cerebellar ataxia with retained tendon reflexes
Early onset cerebellar ataxia with retained tendon reflexes
(EOCARR), or Harding ataxia, was originally described by
Harding in 1981 [181]. More EOCARR cases have been
reported later [182-184]. Chio et al. [185] described 40
cases diagnosed between 1940 and 1990 in a defined area
of North-western Italy. EOCARR is one of the most frequent autosomal recessive ataxias (after Friedreich ataxia
and A-T): the estimated point prevalence ratio is 1/
100,000 population and the birth incidence rate is 1/
48,000 live births. Current data suggest that it is, in fact, a
heterogeneous disorder characterized by early onset cerebellar ataxia (in the first or second decade of life) with
preservation of deep tendon reflexes [186,187].

A locus on chromosome 13q11-12 has been identified in
a Tunisian family, in a position where ARSACS has also
been mapped. Differential diagnosis should exclude
ARSACS (mutation analysis of sacsin gene), and Friedreich ataxia with retained reflexes and slow progression
(analysis of the GAA repeat in the FRDA gene).
Coenzyme Q10 deficiency with cerebellar ataxia
This is a syndrome characterized by childhood-onset
ataxia and cerebellar atrophy, and markedly reduced levels of coenzyme Q10 in muscle biopsies [188]. Patients
associate seizures, developmental delay, mental retardation and pyramidal signs. The pattern of inheritance is
thought to be autosomal recessive [189,190]. Supplementation with high dose of oral coenzyme Q10 may improve
the clinical picture [190]. Recently, a homozygous mutation in the aprataxin gene in a family with coenzyme Q10
deficiency and cerebellar ataxia has been reported [191],
suggesting also that coenzyme Q10 may participate in the
pathogenesis of AOA1.

(PCARP) is characterized by early onset in childhood, sensory ataxia with preservation of pain and temperature,
absent reflexes, ring scotoma and progressive vision loss
leading to blindness [192-194]. The locus AXPC1 has
been mapped to chromosome 1q31 [195].

Diagnostic methods
When suspected on the basis of clinical examination (natural history of the disease, and neurological and systemic
examinations), diagnosis ARCA must be confirmed by
ancillary tests such as neuroimaging (MRI, scanning) and
electrophysiological examination. Neuroimaging is very
useful to distinguish ARCA from developmental disorders

and degenerative diseases, and to define neurological
structures involved in the pathological process. For metabolic disorders associated with ataxia, specific biochemical tests or determination of enzymatic activities are
required. In the last years, identification of the responsible
genes for some ARCA has enabled the confirmation of the
clinical diagnosis by mutation analysis, which is also used
for genetic counseling.

Differential diagnosis
A global differential diagnosis for ARCA is not reported in
this review. However, it is important to underline that the
differential diagnosis should establish whether one ataxic
syndrome is developmental, metabolic, or degenerative.
In addition, Friedreich ataxia, the most prevalent inherited ataxia, especially among the early onset cerebellar
ataxias, can be excluded in a number of cases since a specific molecular test (the expansion of a GAA repeat) is
available.

Genetic counseling
As ARCA are inherited as autosomal recessive traits, previous familial history is usually no reported. The only exception could take place when parents are consanguineous or
originate from the same small town or region. As these
disorders usually have an early onset, genetic counseling
is an important clinical tool for preventing new cases,
especially for young couples with affected first child. Their
risk of having an affected child in further pregnancies is
25%. Prenatal diagnosis is proposed when the disease is
well diagnosed and the causative mutation in the family is
identified. Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis is a new
diagnostic tool but it is available only in a very few services in Europe. Genetic counseling in a healthy carrier is
relevant for consanguineous partners.

logic response. Abetalipoproteinemia, which is associated
with severe neurodegenerative complications, belongs to
the potentially treatable or preventable conditions associated with vitamin E deficiency, similarly to ataxia with
vitamin deficiency (AVED) due to mutations in the α-TTP
gene [199-201]. Abetaliproteinemia treatment is based on
a diet with reduced intake of fat and a supplement of oral
vitamin E at massive dosage (1,000 mg/day for infants to
over 5,000 mg/day for adults) compared with normal
requirements [202-204]. It seems reasonable to start the
treatment with vitamin E given as α-tocopherol acetate 50
mg/kg/day in three divided doses. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is currently treated with chenodeoxycholic
acid (CDCA) but others inhibitors of the HMG-CoA
reductase also reduce plasma cholestanol levels [205207]. CDCA should be administrated in dosage of 750
mg/day (15 mg/kg/day) given in three divided doses.

Unsolved questions
For a number of ataxic syndromes, the etiology or the
causative gene remains unknown. Moreover, only few disorders, as indicated in the section "Treatment", have palliative treatment. Generation of new drugs, or gene and
cell therapy approaches require a better understanding of
the molecular and pathophysiological mechanisms
underlying each disease.

Epidemiology
Friedreich ataxia is the most common inherited ataxia in
Europe, the Middle East, South Asia and North Africa,
with a prevalence of 2/100,000–4/100,000. The prevalence of the early onset cerebellar ataxias (including Friedreich ataxia) and congenital ataxias has been estimated
to 7.2 per 100,000 inhabitants in Cantabria, Spain [196].
Ataxia-telangiectasia is the most common autosomal
recessive ataxia after Friedreich ataxia (estimated prevalence 1-2.5/100,000), followed by the early onset cerebellar ataxia with retained tendon reflexes (1/100,000).

Management including treatments
Although for most of ARCA there is no specific treatment,
for some of them a specific mediaction can be proposed.
Coenzyme Q10 deficiency associated with ataxia may be
responsive to Co Q10 supplementation (300 to 600 mg/
day) [188-190,197,198]. Ubidecarenone (Co Q10) has
been used in some patients with good clinical and patho-
