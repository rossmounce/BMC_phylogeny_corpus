Abstract
Background: Arsenic is a toxic and highly abundant metalloid that endangers human health
through drinking water and the food chain. The most common forms of arsenic in the environment
are arsenate (As(V)) and arsenite (As(III)). As(V) is a non-functional phosphate analog that enters
the food chain via plant phosphate transporters. Inside cells, As(V) becomes reduced to As(III) for
subsequent extrusion or compartmentation. Although much is known about As(III) transport and
handling in microbes and mammals, the transport systems for As(III) have not yet been
characterized in plants.
Results: Here we show that the Nodulin26-like Intrinsic Proteins (NIPs) AtNIP5;1 and AtNIP6;1
from Arabidopsis thaliana, OsNIP2;1 and OsNIP3;2 from Oryza sativa, and LjNIP5;1 and LjNIP6;1
from Lotus japonicus are bi-directional As(III) channels. Expression of these NIPs sensitized yeast
cells to As(III) and antimonite (Sb(III)), and direct transport assays confirmed their ability to
facilitate As(III) transport across cell membranes. On medium containing As(V), expression of the
same NIPs improved yeast growth, probably due to increased As(III) efflux. Our data furthermore
provide evidence that NIPs can discriminate between highly similar substrates and that they may
have differential preferences in the direction of transport. A subgroup of As(III) permeable channels
that group together in a phylogenetic tree required N-terminal truncation for functional expression
in yeast.
Conclusion: This is the first molecular identification of plant As(III) transport systems and we
propose that metalloid transport through NIPs is a conserved and ancient feature. Our
observations are potentially of great importance for improved remediation and tolerance of plants,
and may provide a key to the development of low arsenic crops for food production.

Background
Arsenic is widespread in the Earth's crust and is highly
available in the biosphere. Arsenic is acutely toxic to all
organisms and is rated as a group I human carcinogen by
the International Agency for Research of Cancer [1]. Due
to its high bioavailability and toxicity, arsenic is considered a global health hazard. Contaminated drinking water
is the main source of arsenic intake in several parts of the
world. In Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Chile, China,
Hungary, India, Mexico, Peru, Thailand, and the United
States of America, arsenic concentrations higher than the
permissible levels have been reported and negative effects
on human health have been documented [2]. The second
largest source of arsenic for humans is through ingestion
of food that has accumulated arsenic due to the irrigation
of crop plants with polluted water [3]. In Argentina,
arsenic concentrations of 300–400 parts per billion (ppb)
were measured in soup and maize porridge [4] in villages
where the drinking water was about 200 ppb [4,5], a concentration that is already considerably higher than the
upper limit for drinking water of 10 ppb as recommended
by the World Health Organization [2]. It is estimated that,
worldwide, 1–24% of the tolerable intake of inorganic
arsenic is solely due to the consumption of arsenic-containing rice [6]. Consequently, a detailed understanding
of arsenic uptake and detoxification in plants is of great
interest and is important for strategies in plant biotechnology for designing safer crops as well as for generating
plants for the use in phytoremediation [7].
Arsenate (As(V)) is the prevailing arsenic species in aerated soils. As(V) is a non-functional phosphate analog
that is taken up via plant phosphate transporters [8].
Inside the plant, most of the As(V) is reduced to arsenite
(As(III)) via arsenate reductases [9,10]. As(III) reacts with
sulfhydryl groups in cysteine residues and the imidazolium nitrogen in histidine residues leading to interference
with general protein function [11]. To control As(III) levels in the cytoplasm, As(III) can be conjugated to phytochelatins [12] and probably sequestered into vacuoles by
ABC transporters [13]. Most of the vacuolar arsenic however is inorganic As(III) [14,15]. In Arabidopsis, As(III)
constitutes up to 70% of total arsenic and appears to be
the main transported species [16]. Transporters involved
in As(III) distribution and sequestration at the cellular
level are still unknown. At the whole-plant level, arsenic
can be transported from root to shoot via the vascular system. In the xylem sap, the predominant arsenic species are
inorganic As(III) and As(V) [17,18] but methylated species are also present at low concentrations [17,19].
Recently, aquaglyceroporins from microbes and mammals have been shown to facilitate the movement of
As(III) and the related metalloid antimonite (Sb(III))
across cell membranes (as reviewed in [20]). Moreover, in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/6/26

Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa (rice), members of
the Nodulin26-like Intrinsic Protein (NIP) subfamily of
plant aquaporins, AtNIP5;1 and OsNIP2;1, have been
localized to the plasma membrane in planta and were
shown to play physiologically important roles in the
uptake of the nutritionally important metalloids boron
and silicon, respectively [21,22]. Finally, competition
studies for the uptake of As(III) with glycerol in rice led to
the suggestion that As(III) is also transported through
members of the aquaporin family in plants [23]. Based on
these observations and the fact that members of the NIP
subfamily are believed to be the functional equivalents of
aquaglyceroporins, we hypothesized that NIPs may be
As(III) transporters. To test this prediction directly, we
cloned various NIP isoforms from A. thaliana, Lotus japonicus, and O. sativa and expressed them in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (budding yeast) as a heterologous test system for
metalloid transport. Our data demonstrate that the capacity to channel As(III) and Sb(III) is conserved in the NIPII
subgroup in plants. Expression of specific NIPs was found
to sensitize yeast cells to As(III) and Sb(III) and caused
increased As(III) uptake into yeast. On medium containing As(V), expression of the same NIP isoforms improved
growth, probably due to increased efflux of As(III) accumulating in the yeast cells upon As(V) reduction. Strikingly, a number of NIP isoforms proved particularly
potent in releasing As(III) from yeast cells exposed to
As(V), suggesting that specific NIPs could play a role in
As(III) detoxification in plants.

Results
Expression of specific NIPs from Arabidopsis sensitizes
yeast Δfps1 to As(III) and Sb(III)
To test whether plant aquaporin homologs transport
As(III) and Sb(III), AtNIP1;1, AtNIP2;1, AtNIP5;1,
AtNIP6;1 and AtNIP7;1 were heterologously expressed in
the aquaglyceroporin deficient Δfps1 yeast mutant. As
As(III) and Sb(III) enter yeast cells through Fps1p [24,25],
Δfps1 cells are characterized by low influx and enhanced
resistance towards these metalloids. As positive controls,
we used AQP9 from rat (rAQP9) and ScFPS1 that reverse
metalloid tolerance of Δfps1 cells [24,26]. Yeast transformants were plated on medium containing various concentrations of As(III) or Sb(III) and growth was scored
(Figure 1). Growth of yeast expressing rAQP9 was reduced
on medium containing 2 mM As(III) and completely
repressed in the presence of 6 mM As(III), whereas the
control yeast transformed with the empty vector grew well
at concentrations up to 9 mM As(III). Yeast transformed
with ScFPS1 showed reduced growth at 6 and 9 mM
As(III) (Figure 1A). On medium containing Sb(III),
growth of yeast transformed with rAQP9 was strongly
affected whereas the control grew well at 30 mM Sb(III)
(Figure 1B). Yeast cells expressing AtNIP7;1 were strongly
Sb(III)-sensitive (Figure 1B) but only slightly As(III)-sen-

sitive (Figures 1 and 2A). In contrast, none of the other
plant aquaporin isoforms appeared to sensitize yeast cells
to As(III) or Sb(III) (Figure 1). It was previously reported
that, for functional expression of certain NIP isoforms in
yeast, it is necessary to truncate parts of their hydrophilic
N-terminal domain [27]. Therefore, we genetically engineered N-terminally truncated versions of several NIPs
including Atnip1;1Δ2–44, Atnip2;1Δ2–37, Atnip5;1Δ2–67,
Atnip6;1Δ2–69 and Atnip7;1Δ2–35. Importantly, yeast
expressing the truncated Atnip5;1Δ2–67 and Atnip6;1Δ2–69
showed strong sensitivity towards As(III) (Figure 1A)
whereas growth of these cells was only slightly affected by
Sb(III) (Figure 1B). On the other hand, expression of
Atnip7;1Δ2–35 resulted in a very similar growth phenotype
as expression of the full length AtNIP7;1, both on As(III)and Sb(III)-containing plates (Figures 1 and 2A).
AtNIP1;1 has previously been functionally expressed in
yeast as a full-length protein [28]. Neither full length
AtNIP1;1 nor truncated Atnip1;1Δ2–44 affected metalloid
sensitivity (Figure 1). Similarly, expression of AtNIP2;1 or
Atnip2;1Δ2–37 (Figure 1), or a truncated version of
AtNIP6;1 lacking only 28 aa of the N-terminal domain
(Atnip6;1Δ2–29), had no impact on metalloid sensitivity
(discussed in the following).

Expression of specific NIPs from Arabidopsis sensitizes
the Δfps1 Δacr3 Δycf1 to As(III) and facilitates As(III)
uptake
Yeast cells are equipped with highly sophisticated arsenic
detoxification mechanisms including the arsenate reductase Acr2p, the plasma membrane localized As(III) extrusion transporter Acr3p, and the vacuolar ABC transporter
Ycf1p (as reviewed in [29]). Consequently, yeast is relatively resistant towards externally supplied arsenic and
addition of millimolar concentrations of As(III) to the
medium was needed to score growth reduction of Δfps1
cells expressing Atnip5;1Δ2–67, Atnip6;1Δ2–69, AtNIP7;1
and Atnip7;1Δ2–35 (see Figure 1). Such a concentration
range is rather rare in the plant's environment. In addition, the resulting high-concentration gradient across the
yeast plasma membrane could force As(III) and Sb(III) to
permeate the channels. Therefore, we expressed specific
aquaporin isoforms in the Δfps1 Δacr3 Δycf1 yeast mutant
that is defective in As(III) detoxification and displays
enhanced As(III) sensitivity [24]. Δfps1 Δacr3 Δycf1 cells
expressing rAQP9, Atnip5;1Δ2–67, Atnip6;1Δ2–69, AtNIP7;1
and Atnip7;1Δ2–35 displayed increased As(III) sensitivity
compared with the empty vector control whereas cells

expressing full-length AtNIP5;1 and AtNIP6;1 were not
different from the control (Figure 2A).

We next tested the ability of these NIPs to transport As(III)
in direct uptake measurements. The Δfps1 Δacr3 Δycf1
mutant has a low level of As(III) influx (Figure 2B).
Expression of rAQP9, Atnip5;1Δ2–67, Atnip6;1Δ2–69,
AtNIP7;1 and Atnip7;1Δ2–35 led to a significant increase in
As(III) uptake after 30 and 60 minutes of exposure. The
amount of As(III) taken up by the different transformants
corresponded well with the degree of As(III) sensitivity
seen when growing the respective transformant on As(III)containing medium (rAQP9 > Atnip5;1Δ2–67 > Atnip6;1Δ2–
69 > Atnip7;1Δ2–35 ≈ AtNIP7;1; see Figure 2A and 2B).
Moreover, we note that N-terminal truncation of
AtNIP7;1 only affected As(III) transport to a minor extent
(Figure 2B), which is in line with the observed phenotypes
(Figure 2A). Finally, the relatively low level of As(III)
influx into cells expressing full-length or truncated
AtNIP7;1 is consistent with the observation that sensitivity is only clearly visible in the sensitized Δfps1 Δacr3 Δycf1
mutant.
Expression of specific NIPs from Arabidopsis improves
growth of Δfps1 Δacr3 Δycf1 on medium containing As(V)
As(V) enters yeast cells via phosphate transporters. To
avoid interference with phosphate assimilation and
metabolism, yeast, like other organisms, reduces As(V) to
the more mobile As(III) for subsequent extrusion and
sequestration, as reviewed in [29]. The Δfps1 Δacr3 Δycf1
yeast mutant lacks transport systems for As(III) and, as the
result of the action of Acr2p, accumulates As(III) in the
presence of externally supplied As(V). Δfps1 Δacr3 Δycf1 is
therefore more sensitive towards externally supplied
As(V) [24]. When transformed with the empty vector,
growth of Δfps1 Δacr3 Δycf1 was severely affected by 50
μM As(V) (Figure 3). Similar growth was recorded for cells
expressing full-length AtNIP5;1 and AtNIP6;1, which also
did not facilitate As(III) influx (see Figure 1). In contrast,
the expression of rAQP9, Atnip5;1Δ2–67 and Atnip6;1Δ2–69
rendered cells more resistant to externally supplied As(V)
(Figure 3). Cells expressing rAQP9 grew slightly better on
As(V) than control cells whereas cells expressing
Atnip5;1Δ2–67 and Atnip6;1Δ2–69 were able to grow in the
presence of up to 0.2 mM As(V). The fact that certain NIPs
can improve growth in the presence of As(V) strongly suggests that they mediate As(III) efflux and supports the
notion that these proteins are bi-directional channels.
Expressing AtNIP7;1 did not improve As(V) resistance
compared with the empty vector control. Strikingly,
although expression of rAQP9 resulted in more severe
growth inhibition on medium containing As(III) than
expression of Atnip5;1Δ2–67 and Atnip6;1Δ2–69 (Figure 2A),
yeast transformed with Atnip5;1Δ2–67 and Atnip6;1Δ2–69
grew much better on medium containing As(V) than

have different preferences regarding the direction of transport.
The capacity of NIP homologs to transport As(III) and
Sb(III) is conserved across plant species
To gain more functional understanding of the NIP proteins, we first performed a phylogenetic analysis including
33 NIP homologs from various species, using rat AQP9 as
an out-group (Figure 4). The phylogenetic analyses support, and refine further, the subdivision of the NIP subfamily of the aquaporin superfamily into the two
subgroups NIPI and NIPII [30-33]. Together, the phylogenetic analysis, transport assays, and phenotypic data presented above, suggested that the capacity to facilitate
diffusion of As(III) and Sb(III) across membranes is associated with members of the NIPII subgroup. To substantiate our hypothesis, one isoform of subgroup I (OsNIP1;1)
and three isoforms of subgroup II (OsNIP2;1, OsNIP2;2
and OsNIP3;2) from rice were expressed in yeast and
tested for their permeability towards As(III). Expression of

OsNIP2;1 and OsNIP3;2 sensitized yeast to As(III) (Figure
5A) and Sb(III) (data not shown), whereas their expression improved growth of Δfps1 Δacr3 Δycf1 on As(V)-containing medium (Figure 5B). Expression of OsNIP2;2
produced moderate As(III) and Sb(III) sensitivities (Figure 5A and data not shown). In contrast, OsNIP1;1 expression did not affect growth at all (data not shown). Finally,
direct transport assays confirmed that the increased sensitivity of cells expressing OsNIP2;1 towards As(III) was the
result of increased influx into those cells (Figure 5C).

Lack of competitive uptake between As(III) and B(OH)3 or
Si(OH)4 into yeast cells expressing AtNIP5;1 and
OsNIP2;1
OsNIP2;1 and AtNIP5;1 were earlier identified as physiologically important Si(OH)4 and B(OH)3 channels in rice
[22] and Arabidopsis [21], respectively. When expressed in
oocytes, AtNIP5;1 mediated the uptake of B(OH)3 and
OsNIP2;1 mediated the uptake of Si(OH)4. Here we demonstrated that As(III) is an additional and common substrate for both proteins. To address whether there is
selectivity for the uptake of one metalloid over another,
we exposed yeast cells expressing OsNIP2;1 to As(III)

alone or together with various concentrations of Si(OH)4.
However, there was no significant difference in the uptake
of As(III), even at a 10-fold higher concentration of
Si(OH)4 over As(III) (data not shown). Similarly, no significant difference in As(III) uptake through Atnip5;1Δ2–
67 could be measured when yeast cells were exposed to
both As(III) and B(OH)3 even at a 10-fold higher concentration of B(OH)3 over As(III) (data not shown). Higher
concentrations of Si(OH)4 in the uptake assay cannot be
used because of polymerization of monosilic acid to polysilicic acid, and higher concentration of B(OH)3 will lower
the pH of the medium. Thus, at physiologically relevant
concentrations of Si(OH)4 and B(OH)3, no measurable
competition for the uptake of As(III) could be detected.
Proper functional expression of some NIP isoforms in yeast
requires deletion of the N-terminal hydrophilic domain
As shown above, N-terminal truncation allows functional
expression of certain NIPs in yeast. To test whether truncation is necessary for proper expression of NIPs in yeast,
we extracted microsomal membranes from Δfps1 and
Δfps1 Δacr3 Δycf1 cells transformed with AtNIP6;1,
Atnip6;1Δ2–29 and Atnip6;1Δ2–69 and probed the extracts by
Western-blot analysis using an anti-AtNIP6;1 specific antibody (Figure 6). The antibody was raised against a peptide
corresponding to a sequence in the C-terminal end of the
protein (Per Kjellbom and Urban Johanson, personal
communication). Therefore, the signal on a Western blot
should reflect the relative abundance of full-length and
truncated versions of AtNIP6;1 in these extracts. In microsomal membranes from yeast transformed with fulllength AtNIP6;1 or both truncated versions, a clear signal

could be detected between 35 and 55 kD, which might
represent the oligomeric forms of the respective protein
(Figure 6, arrowheads). The bands corresponding to the
truncated forms of AtNIP6;1 migrated faster, as expected
from the lower molecular weight due to deletion of the Nterminal 28 and 68 aa, respectively and the monomeric
forms were also detected (Figure 6, arrows). Truncation of
aa 2–29 had little effect on protein levels, whereas truncation of aa 2–69 resulted in higher amount compared with
full length AtNIP6;1. We note that the various AtNIP6;1
forms did not migrate according to their molecular size, a
phenomenon commonly observed for proteins of the
aquaporin family [34,35]. The amount of the heterologous proteins was generally lower in the triple mutant
Δfps1 Δacr3 Δycf1 than in Δfps1.
Interestingly, the necessity to remove part of the N-terminal domain does not seem to apply to all members of the
NIPII subgroup, as AtNIP7;1, OsNIP3;2 and OsNIP2;1
could be functionally expressed in yeast as full-length proteins (Figures 2 and 5). We therefore hypothesized that
the necessity to truncate the N-terminal domain for functional expression in yeast applies to a subpopulation
within the NIPII subgroup.
To substantiate this notion, we cloned two additional
NIPII homologs from the legume L. japonicus. Primers
were designed according to Expressed Sequence Tag (EST)
sequences of the N- and the C-termini of probable major
intrinsic proteins of L. japonicus from the databases [36].

formed with the empty vector (Figure 7B). Hence, truncating the N-terminus of LjNIPs resulted in As(III) transport,
similar to what was observed for AtNIP5;1 and AtNIP6;1.

Discussion and conclusion
Aquaglyceroporins from bacteria, yeast, protozoa and
mammals have been shown to facilitate transport of the
metalloids As(III) and Sb(III) across cell membranes (as
reviewed in [20]). Here, we demonstrate that members of
the NIP subfamily of plant aquaporins, which are
believed to be the functional equivalents to microbial and
mammalian aquaglyceroporins, mediate As(III) and
Sb(III) transport when expressed in yeast. We conclude
that the capacity of aquaporins to transport As(III) and
Sb(III) is also well conserved in plants.

ing nomenclature for aquaporins in L. japonicus, we
named them LjNIP5;1 and LjNIP6;1. The full-length coding sequences were submitted to GenBank [37] and are
available under accession numbers EU294214 and
EU294215, respectively. Expression of the N-terminally
truncated versions of both LjNIP5;1 and LjNIP6;1
(Ljnip5;1Δ2–72 and Ljnip6;1Δ2–59) drastically sensitized
Δfps1 Δacr3 Δycf1 cells to As(III) whereas expression of the
corresponding full length clones did not (LjNIP5;1) or
only to a moderate extent (LjNIP6;1) (Figure 7A). The
truncated versions also sensitized cells to Sb(III) (data not
shown). When As(V) was supplied to the growth medium,
the expression of Lotus Ljnip5;1Δ2–72 and Ljnip6;1Δ2–59
increased growth compared with control cells trans-

It has been reported that truncating parts of the
hydrophilic N-terminal domain of certain NIPs is necessary to achieve functional expression in yeast and that the
N-terminus is not required for the transport activity itself
[27]. Our data support these findings as N-terminal truncation of AtNIP5;1 and AtNIP6;1 was necessary for functional expression in yeast (Figures 1, 2 and 3). On the
other hand, truncation of AtNIP7;1 had little effect on its
transport capacity (Figures 1, 2 and 3), supporting the
interpretation that the hydrophilic N-terminal domain is
not important for basic channel function. Interestingly,
the necessity to remove part of the N-terminal domain
does not apply to all members of the NIPII subgroup, as
AtNIP7;1, OsNIP3;2 and OsNIP2;1 could be functionally
expressed in yeast as full-length proteins (Figures 1, 2, 3
and 5). This is in accordance with data from functional
expression of another full-length NIPII isoform from
Cucurbita pepo (CpNIP) in yeast [38]. Hence, the necessity
to truncate the N-terminal domain for functional expression in yeast appears to apply to a subpopulation within
the NIPII subgroup.
In contrast to yeast, AtNIP5;1 and AtNIP6;1 were successfully expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes as full-length proteins [21,31]. In fact, it is not known why truncation is
required for functional expression in yeast. Our Westernblot analysis of AtNIP6;1 suggests that the physical expression could be part of the reason; truncation of aa 2–69
resulted in increased protein levels in yeast membranes
when compared with full-length AtNIP6;1. We can, however, not exclude that other reasons may contribute to this
phenomenon. Deletion of the N-terminal domain could
influence the targeting of the protein in the yeast secretory
pathway. Alternatively, the N-terminal domain could
function in gating the channel and components of a putative post-translational regulation mechanism displacing
an inhibitory domain may be absent in yeast. A function
of the N-terminal domain in gating has been ascribed to
the yeast endogenous Fps1p [39,40], and phosphoryla-

tion affects Fps1p transport activity [25]. Phosphorylation
of plant and mammalian aquaporins was also shown to
modulate transport function as well as localization [4143] and GmNOD26 of Glycine max is phosphorylated during specific developmental stages [44]. Strikingly, all isoforms that need to be truncated for functional expression
in yeast contain a consensus Mitogen Activated Protein
Kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation site [32] consisting of a
Pro-X-Ser/Thr-Pro motif in their N-terminus. This motif is
missing in other NIPII homologs. The conservation of this
site (Table 1) suggests that phosphorylation is required
for functional expression and that phosphorylation may
have a regulatory role in plants. However, deletion of the
conserved MAPK site in the case of AtNIP6;1 (Atnip6;1Δ2–
29) and subsequent expression in yeast did not result in
As(III) transport activity (Figures 2 and 3). Hence, the
phosphorylation site itself is not identical with a potential
inhibitory domain.
Based on the amino acids forming the selectivity filter, the
NIP subfamily of plant aquaporins has been divided into
two subgroups, NIPI and NIPII [30-33]. According to this
classification, NIPI group homologs are characterized by
the consensus motif W I/V A/G R (Table 2). The NIPII
group was initially defined for homologs characterized by

the consensus motif A I/V A/G R. Later, OsNIP2;1,
OsNIP2;2 and OsNIP3;2 were also placed in the NIPII
subgroup [32], despite having a slightly different pattern
of amino acids in their selective filter. Furthermore, the
amino acid motif in the constriction region of LjNIP6;1 is
distinct from the aforementioned examples but similar to
MtNIP3 and MtNIP4 from Medicago trunculata (Table 2),
all of which group to NIPII in our phylogenetic analysis
(Figure 4). However, common to all NIPII isoforms, is a
small hydrophilic amino acid residue at the first position,
where animal, microbial and other plant NIPs have either
an aromatic F or a W. The division into NIPI and NIPII
also appears to be a valuable grouping from a functional
perspective, as OsNIP2;1, OsNIP2;2 and OsNIP3;2 also
proved to channel As(III) and Sb(III) similar to other
NIPII proteins tested in this study. However, the diverse
patterns of amino acids in the selective filters of all As(III)
and Sb(III) transporting aquaporin homologs from various organisms (Table 2) strongly suggests that other features must be important for the selectivity of these
channels. Interestingly, NIP isoforms that facilitate the
diffusion of other hydroxylated metalloids such as
B(OH)3 [21] and Si(OH)4 [22] also belong to the NIPII
subgroup (Figure 4). Thus, accumulating evidence suggests that in plants, NIPII aquaporins are metalloid chan-

nels. In contrast, none of the isoforms of the NIPI
subgroup tested here mediated As(III) transport. Members of the NIPI subgroup are expressed upon symbiosis
with rhizobium and localized to the peribacteroid membrane in legume plants [44-46] and in plants interacting
with mycorrhizal fungi [47]. Recently, AtNIP2;1, a member of the NIPI subgroup in Arabidopsis was shown to be
induced at transcriptional level upon exposure to anoxic
conditions [48]. When heterologously expressed in
oocytes, AtNIP2;1 significantly increased the permeability
for lactic acid, whereas only a minor permeability for
water and glycerol, the 'conventional' aquaporin substrates, was recorded [48].
Glycerol has often been used as a substrate to monitor
NIP channel activity [27,28,44,49]. Recent studies have
shown that As(III) and Sb(III) exist as hydroxylated
As(OH)3 and Sb(OH)3 at neutral pH [50,51]. Moreover,
As(OH)3 and Sb(OH)3 show very strong structural similarity both to each other and to glycerol [50]. Hence, it
was proposed that As(OH)3 and Sb(OH)3 transit through
aquaglyceroporins through the same path as glycerol [50].
Similar conclusions could be drawn for NIPs in plants.
However, in plants there is no direct evidence for a physiological role of glycerol transport through NIPs. Instead,
metalloids may in fact represent the primary substrate of
NIPII homologs. Notably, experimental data show that
permeability for glycerol does not always coincide with

the transport capacity for As(III) and Sb(III): (i) AtNIP1;1
transports glycerol [28] but does not seem to transport
either As(III) or Sb(III) (this work); and (ii) OsNIP2;1 is
shown here to be permeable for As(III) but is impermeable for glycerol [22]. The variability in the constriction
region [33] along with other structural features of the
channel path of NIPs seem to play a role in the discrimination between structurally highly similar solutes such as
As(III), Sb(III) and glycerol. Interestingly, our phylogenetic analysis with rAQP9 as an out-group suggests that an
ancestral NIP was capable of metalloid transport and that
this capacity was lost in NIPI proteins (Figure 4). Nevertheless, this inference will require rigorous testing of more
NIPs for the presence or absence of metalloid transport.
Due to the close structural similarity between As(OH)3
and Sb(OH)3, it was proposed that any difference
observed in the toxicological properties of these metalloids must be related to processes other than cellular
uptake [50]. However, in our study, expression of
AtNIP7;1 only had a marginal effect on yeast growth on
medium containing As(III), whereas on medium containing Sb(III), growth of the same transformants was strongly
impaired (Figure 1). For yeast expressing Atnip5;1Δ2–67
and Atnip6;1Δ2–69, the opposite effects were seen with
high sensitivity towards As(III) but only a mild increase in
sensitivity towards Sb(III) (Figure 1). Thus, despite the
high structural similarity of the two metalloids, our data

Aquaporin (AQP) homologs tested for transport of arsenite and antimonite. The tetrad of amino acids from transmembrane helix 2 (R1),
transmembrane helix 5 (R2), and 2 residues from loop E (R3 and R4) that constitutes the selective filter are displayed. The abilities to channel the
influx or efflux of arsenite or influx of antimonite of the tested aquaporins in various growth and transport assays are ranked (nd, not determined;

demonstrate that NIPs can to some extent discriminate
between As(III) and Sb(III) for selective transport.
OsNIP2;1 was originally identified as a Si(OH)4 specific
channel without significant permeability for glycerol [22],
and AtNIP5;1 was shown to be crucial for the uptake of
B(OH)3 [21]. AtNIP5;1 and OsNIP2;1 are localized to the
distal plasma membrane domain of the endodermis in
Arabidopsis roots [21], and endodermis and exodermis of
rice roots [22]. These cell layers represent a border for apoplastic transport. Nutrients taken up into the shoot via the
vascular system have to enter the symplast by transport
across the plasma membrane. Here we show that
OsNIP2;1 and AtNIP5;1 are also permeable for the toxic
metalloids As(III) and Sb(III). From a physiological point
of view, the permeability for both beneficial (silicon) and
essential (boron) nutrients as well as toxic substrates
could pose a major problem for the plant; in the presence
of arsenic in the soil solution, the expressed channels
could be responsible for the uptake of toxic As(III). This
would be problematic for rice, in particular, as rice roots
grow in low oxygen soils, favoring the formation of the
reduced form As(III). Hence, under conditions of low Si
in the soil, leading to induction of OsNIP2;1, and under
concomitant presence of As(III), rice roots are likely to
take up As(III) via OsNIP2;1. Our data indicate that under
physiologically relevant concentrations, Si(OH)4 does not
compete with As(III) for uptake through OsNIP2;1, suggesting that OsNIP2;1 has a high capacity for the transport

of both metalloids. It will be important to investigate if
OsNIP2;1 and AtNIP5;1 are differentially regulated by
As(III) versus Si(OH)4 and B(OH)3 in rice and Arabidopsis,
respectively.
Transport of As(III) through NIPs and translocation to the
shoot is potentially interesting for strategies of phytoremediation and the removal of arsenic from contaminated
sites. In rice, uptake and translocation of Si(OH)4 is
achieved by the concerted action of OsNIP2;1 and OsLsi2,
the latter displaying homology to plant citrate transporters and to the Escherichia coli ArsB As(III) efflux transporter
[22,52]. Rice Lsi2 is localized to the proximal plasma
membrane domains of endodermis and exodermis cells.
Si(OH)4, entering the cells via OsNIP2;1 is actively transported out of the cell and into the apoplastic continuum
of the water transporting xylem elements for long-distance transport to the shoot [22]. However, expression of
OsLsi2 or its closest homologs Os10g0547500 and
At1g02260 did not affect yeast growth in the presence of
As(III) or As(V) (data not shown). Although our data do
not indicate that OsLsi2 and its homologs transport
As(III) in yeast, it will be important to investigate this
issue in plants.
Mammalian AQP9 was earlier shown to transport As(III)
when expressed in yeast and Xenopus oocytes [26,53,54].
Interestingly, mono-methylated As(III), which is formed
inside liver cells, was transported three times more effi-

ciently than inorganic As(III), which led us to suggest that
AQP9 could serve a function in arsenic detoxification
[20]. Here, rAQP9 was very efficient in the uptake of
As(III) but less effective in releasing the As(III) produced
by yeast cells through the reduction of As(V). In contrast,
NIP isoforms investigated here were less effective than
rAQP9 in the uptake of As(III), but proved superior in
supporting yeast growth in the presence of As(V). Plant
cells primarily take up the oxidized form As(V) via high
affinity phosphate transporters at the plasma membrane.
It was recently reported that roots of rice and tomato
plants have the capacity to efflux As(III) at high rate, when
provided with As(V) in the growth medium [55]. The efficiency of some NIPIIs in extruding As(III) seen here supports the hypothesis that NIPII homologs may play a
physiological role in arsenic detoxification. Such a role
has been ascribed to the aquaglyceroporin AqpS from the
legume symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti [56]. Although
this work demonstrates that specific plant aquaporins
facilitate As(III) and Sb(III) transport, more work is
needed to understand the role of As(III) transport through
NIPII homologs in planta and we are currently putting
efforts into this.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that specific plant NIPs
transport As(III) and Sb(III) across cell membranes. Since
the influx and efflux of toxic compounds is intimately
linked to toxicity and detoxification, the identification of
the proteins involved in this process provides a first
important step towards the development of strategies for
improving tolerance and remediation by plants.

Methods

ycf1Δ::loxP acr3Δ::loxP-kanMX-loxP [58]) were used in this
study. Yeast cells were grown on synthetic medium containing 2% glucose (SD) or 2% galactose (SG), 50 mM
succinic acid/Tris base, pH 5.5, 0.7% yeast nitrogen base
w/o amino acids (Difco) and supplemented with 0.003%
each tryptophane, leucine, adenine and histidine according to the auxothrophic requirements of specific strains.
Yeast cells were diluted in sterile water to an A600 of 0.01
(or various dilutions as indicated), and 10 μl were spotted
on solid SG-medium containing various concentrations
of sodium arsenite (Sigma), sodium arsenate (Aldrich) or
potassium antimonyl tartrate (Hopkins and Williams

differences in growth were scored. Data were duplicated in
at least two independent experiments with consistent
results.

Cloning of plant aquaporins
The open reading frames of plant sequences were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific
primers (Table 3). The resulting PCR products were
cloned into the yeast expression vector pYES2.1 (Invitrogen) and verified by DNA sequencing. Some of the open
reading frames were cloned using a uracil-excision based
cloning as described by Nour-Eldin et al. [59]. Oligonucleotides (Table 3) matching the EST sequences
AV764898, AV419109 and BP048179 were used in a PCR
on single-stranded cDNA prepared from five-week-old L.
japonicus seedlings. Two independent PCRs for each
aquaporin were performed. The PCR products of the
expected size were sub-cloned and three clones were
sequenced for each gene. Two full-length sequences were
obtained and submitted to GenBank under EU294214
and EU294215[37] for LjNIP5;1 and LjNIP6;1, respectively.
Membrane protein extraction and Western blotting
S. cerevisiae (Δfps1 and Δfps1 Δacr3 Δycf1) expressing individual plant genes or transformed with the empty vector
pYES2.1 were pre-cultured over night in selective medium
and expression was induced in a subsequent over night
culture in 1% yeast extract (Difco), 2% peptone (Difco)
and 2% galactose. Cells were harvested, re-suspended in
homogenization buffer (220 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 42
mM EDTA pH 8, 42.5% glycerol, 10 μM ATP and proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche)) and broken using acid
washed glass beads (Sigma). After removal of cell debris
by centrifugation (8000 g for 15 minutes), the microsomal membrane fractions were collected at 100,000 g for
1 hour. Pellets were resuspended and homogenized in
resuspension buffer (20% glycerol, 100 mM Tris/HCl pH
7.5, 1 mM EDTA pH 8, 1 mM DTT, and proteinase inhibitor cocktail). Protein concentrations were determined
according to Bradford using the assay from Bio-Rad with
BSA as standard. We separated 20 μg of membrane protein on SDS-polyacrylamid gels (4% stacking gel; 12%
separation gel) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) by electroblotting. Membranes were
blocked in 2% milk powder in TBS. Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in TBS at 1:500 (anti-NIP6;1
antibody) and 1:10,000 (goat anti-rabbit IgG-AP conjugate, Bio-Rad), respectively. Detection was performed
using NBT/BCIP (Promega). Coomassie stained gels were
routinely run as loading control.
Arsenic transport assays
Arsenic transport assays were performed essentially as
described previously [24]. Briefly, exponentially growing
yeast cells in SG medium were exposed to sodium arsenite. Cells were collected at the time points indicated in the
figures, washed in ice-cold water and pelleted by centrifugation. The cell pellets were resuspended in water, boiled,

centrifuged and the supernatants were collected. The
arsenic content of each sample was determined using a
graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer (SIMAA
6000; Perkin-Elmer) as described previously [60]. For
competition assays, equimolar or 10-fold molar excess of
Si(OH)4 or B(OH)3 was added together with the As(III).
Samples for arsenic content were collected and analyzed
as above. All transport assays were performed at least three
times and the values are given with SD.
Alignment and phylogenetic analyses
33 sequences corresponding to plant NIP homologs plus
rat AQP9 (out-group) were aligned in MAFFT 6.240 [61]
and analyzed phylogenetically in MrBayes 3.0 [62] (Bayesian analysis: 5 million generations, 1 tree sampled every
5000 generations, 8 MCMCMC chains and a 50% burn-

in) and PAUP 4.0b10 [63] (parsimony analysis: 10,000
random addition sequences with 10 trees held per step
and TBR branch swapping with at most 25 trees saved per
round; branch support was estimated through 25,000
jackknife replicates). The final alignment consisted of 34
sequences and 315 amino acid residues, 212 (67%) of
which were parsimony informative. The 50% majorityrule consensus phylogram computed from the resulting
2500 trees of the Bayesian analysis is shown in Figure 4.
In the parsimony analysis, one of the most parsimonious
trees of length 1644 was recovered (CI = 0.6150, RI =
0.6941). The support values from the jackknife analysis
are superimposed onto the Bayesian tree in Figure 4[64].
