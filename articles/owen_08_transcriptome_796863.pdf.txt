Abstract
Background: Natural contamination and anthropogenic pollution of soils are likely to be major
determinants of functioning and survival of keystone invertebrate taxa. Soil animals will have both
evolutionary adaptation and genetically programmed responses to these toxic chemicals, but
mechanistic understanding of such is sparse. The clitellate annelid Lumbricus rubellus is a model
organism for soil health testing, but genetic data have been lacking.
Results: We generated a 17,000 sequence expressed sequence tag dataset, defining ~8,100
different putative genes, and built an 8,000-element transcriptome microarray for L. rubellus.
Strikingly, less than half the putative genes (43%) were assigned annotations from the gene ontology
(GO) system; this reflects the phylogenetic uniqueness of earthworms compared to the wellannotated model animals. The microarray was used to identify adult- and juvenile-specific transcript
profiles in untreated animals and to determine dose-response transcription profiles following
exposure to three xenobiotics from different chemical classes: inorganic (the metal cadmium),
organic (the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon fluoranthene), and agrochemical (the herbicide
atrazine). Analysis of these profiles revealed compound-specific fingerprints which identify the
molecular responses of this annelid to each contaminant. The data and analyses are available in an
integrated database, LumbriBASE.
Conclusion: L. rubellus has a complex response to contaminant exposure, but this can be efficiently
analysed using molecular methods, revealing unique response profiles for different classes of
effector. These profiles may assist in the development of novel monitoring or bioremediation
protocols, as well as in understanding the ecosystem effects of exposure.

Background
Ever since Charles Darwin's classic work [1], earthworms
(Phylum Annelida, Class Oligochaeta) have been
renowned as 'ecosystem engineers' in recognition of the
direct and indirect effects they have on water, nutrient and
carbon cycling in temperate and tropical soils [2]. Earthworms have therefore been widely adopted by international and national agencies for the diagnosis of soil
ecosystem health, and for predicting the potential environmental impact of xenobiotics, such as industrial chemicals, pesticides and medicines, from anthropogenic
sources [3]. Quantification of chemical toxicity to earthworms currently relies on measuring the effects of exposure on key life-history traits (survival, growth, and
reproduction) in standardised laboratory bioassays conducted with certain test species (Eisenia fetida, Eisenia
andrei and Lumbricus rubellus). These bioassays can produce sensitive estimates of population effects, but are not
suited to elucidation of mechanisms of action, and thus
may be difficult to generalise from. For example, xenobiotic exposure may affect individual physiology, cocoonlay rates, cocoon viability and juvenile growth rates in a
specific manner, resulting in different outcomes for population growth rate and age structure.
Complementing measurements of gross toxicity with
molecular profiling and genomic studies can make plain
the modes of action of specific xenobiotics and identify
the generality of biological process affected as well as the
molecular response pathways invoked [4-8]. Taking a specific example, it has been observed that L. rubellus is able
to colonise highly metal-contaminated environments
[8,9]. Detailed work identified that the primary molecules
responsible for this metal tolerance were earthworm metallothioneins [10-15]. Though successful, the progress of
these mechanistic studies has been handicapped by the
lack of available sequence data for earthworms in public
databases and the finding that very few (<30%) of the few
available earthworm gene fragments could be identified
by sequence similarity to previously sequenced genes.
To help bridge this gap in available sequence information,
a previously described small-scale (600 sequences)
expressed sequence tag (EST) dataset for L. rubellus was
generated [16]. This has prompted the extended survey of
the L. rubellus transcribed genome through extensive sampling of additional cDNA libraries from earthworms at
defined lifecycle stages (late embryo, juvenile, adult), specific tissues (anterior segments and reproductive organs)
and following acute exposure to model chemicals representing three different contaminant classes: inorganic (the
nonessential heavy metal cadmium [Cd] and the essential
metal copper [Cu]), organic (the polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon [PAH], fluoranthene [FLA]), and agrochemical (the herbicide atrazine [ATZ]) that is reported here.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/266

From this transcriptome resource, we defined ~8100
genes, and have fabricated a cDNA microarray to investigate the transcriptome responses of L. rubellus through
normal growth and following sub-lethal exposure to a
series of sub-lethal concentrations of Cd, FLA, and ATZ.
From the derived transcript profiles we identify the key
molecular responses and biochemical pathways associated with each life-stage treatment, and propose mechanisms of action for the three chemicals.

Results and Discussion
Generation of ESTs from cDNA libraries spanning the L.
rubellus lifecycle and following exposure to target
chemicals
We generated 17,225 high-quality ESTs from nine different cDNA libraries constructed from L. rubellus raised
under defined conditions (Table 1 and Additional File 1;
all sequences are available in EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ and
in the project database LumbriBASE [see below]). We
maximised the gene discovery rate by screening out, from
some libraries, a small number of highly-expressed
mRNAs (identified as clusters with many members after
initial sequencing of ~4,000 ESTs). The ESTs were clustered using the PartiGene suite of tools [17] and 8,129
clusters (different putative genes, named using permanent
identifiers of the form 'LRC#####') were defined. This
number of putative genes is likely to be an overestimate
because (1) alternative splice forms may be assembled
into different clusters, (2) the partial nature of ESTs may
result in non-overlap between sequences from the same
mRNA, and (3) our earthworms were drawn from an outbred source and allelic variation is likely. Within-dataset
analyses suggested that the effects of these factors are
minor, and that the true diversity in the dataset is ~8,000
different loci. If, like other non-vertebrates, L. rubellus has
between 15,000 and 20,000 protein-coding genes, the
sequencing effort has generated sequence tags for ~40–
50% of all genes in this key species.

Clusters (putative genes) with one EST member accounted
for 53% (5361) of all clusters (Figure 1). There were 7913
clusters containing ten or fewer ESTs (97% of the total),
and only 20 clusters had over 50 ESTs. Of the clusters with
more than one EST, approximately 50% were library-specific. Such specificity may simply reflect the low density of
sampling rather than real expression differences between
libraries. For each cluster, we derived a consensus cDNA
sequence, and from this derived a putative protein translation using prot4EST [18]. Some clusters (281) yielded
more than one consensus, possibly due to alternative
splice forms or divergent alleles. Across all the L. rubellus
libraries, the 8,129 consensus sequences had a mean
length of 611 bases (± 243) (Table 1). The mean length of
L. rubellus putative proteins was 107 amino acids (i.e. 53%
of the mean consensus length). Variation in mean protein

1. See Additional File 1 for more detailed descriptions of the libraries used.
2. A cluster is counted as derived from a library if it contains at least one EST from that library. Thus the longest cluster (LRC00201, encoding
paramyosin) contains ESTs from five of the nine libraries and counts as a member of all five.

length between libraries was directly related to the variation in consensus length.
The sequence and annotation data (including clustering,
consensus sequences, predicted protein sequences, and
functional categorisations) are available in a relational
database, LumbriBASE. The database has been used as a
workbench for our analyses (including microarray experiment annotation and visualisation; see below), and is presented on the web through a PHP-scripted interface [19].
Functional annotation of the L. rubellus gene set
Gene ontology (GO) terms [20] were assigned to L. rubellus predicted proteins using GOtcha [21] and the analysis
summarised by assessing representation of higher-level
(GOSlim) terms (Figure 2). Less than half (3460; 43%) of
the putative protein translations were assigned a GO term
at a confidence greater than 50. This apparently high proportion of unannotated genes in L. rubellus can be

explained by our application of the conservative GOtcha
algorithm and by the paucity of genomic information
from other annelid species. For those GOSlim "Function"
and "Process" categories with a mean representation
across all libraries of ≥ 1, we examined under- and overrepresentation in each library (Figure 2). The developing
cocoon library had the highest representation of nucleic
acid binding, nucleotide binding, chaperone, and protein
binding, likely derived from the presence of actively developing embryos in these animals, while the juvenile library
had an over representation of lipid-binding annotations
(Figure 2A). As expected, the control adult library was
lacking in terms associated with heavy metal binding
compared to libraries derived from Cu- or Cd-treated
earthworms. However, unexpectedly, the library from
FLA-exposed animals also had increased representation of
this annotation. The FLA library also exhibited overrepresentation of carbohydrate-binding and FK506-sensitive
peptidyl-prolyl isomerase annotations. In the library from

library. The figure illustrates the proportion of the ESTs generated from each library which are associated within clusters containing a total of 1 (singletons, Black bars), 2–9 (grey bars) and 10 or more ESTs (Clear bars).

Cd-treated animals both receptor signalling and globin
classes were abundant compared to other libraries, perhaps reflecting the interference of Cd with the functions of
other, essential metals. In the less-closely defined "process" categories, Cd-treated and juvenile worm-derived
libraries had more annotations of 'cell death' than other
libraries (Figure 2B). Many of these general observations
were confirmed through the use of microarrays (see
below).
The only other "soil" animal for which extensive gene
annotation data exist is the rhabditid nematode
Caenorhabditis elegans, though ecotoxicology analyses
focussed on this species are limited [22]. Identification of
possible orthologues between L. rubellus and C. elegans
using BLAST similarity identified 1009 (12%) L. rubellus
sequences with a BLAST hit in the C. elegans proteome
(Wormpep 145) with an e-value of less than 1e-25, 569 of
which were reciprocal top hits between the species (identified on the protein report pages of LumbriBASE). Of
these, 158 had annotations relating to C. elegans RNAi
experiments (as represented in WormBase [23]) but these
were largely uninformative as to biological function.

Fabrication and validation of a L. rubellus cDNA
microarray
To profile life-cycle and xenobiotic transcriptome
responses, a custom cDNA microarray was fabricated
using representative reporters from each cluster. Each
spotted cDNA originated from a clone processed for
sequencing. The hybridisation was performed using a
nested reference design. In detail, the reference sample
(labelled with Cy5) was derived from two 65–70-mer oligonucleotides designed against vector sequence between
the amplification primer and the inserted cDNA and coamplified during insert preparation (Additional File 2).
Probes derived from mRNA preparations were labelled
with Cy3. This nested reference design permitted direct
comparison between samples both within and between
experiments. Four experiments were undertaken, comparing juvenile and adult stages and comparing transcriptional responses following exposure to Cd, FLA and ATZ.
All exposures were generated using a common experimental set-up designed to generate a set of biologically replicated samples for a series of exposure concentrations
(Figure 3).

(grouped as 'no annotations' on the figure).

After hybridisation, array scanning, and pre-processing,
the initial technical validation included visual inspection
of images to identify gross abnormalities or background.
Prior to normalisation the sensitivity of the array and relationship between RNA concentration and fluorescent signal was assessed by calculating the signal intensity
generated by reporters complementary to 10 "alien" RNA
spikes introduced at known concentrations, from 1 pmole
to 30 nmole, prior to labelling (exemplar plots are provided in Additional File 3). Following normalisation the
distribution of data responses was examined and any samples showing abnormal distribution were discarded from
the analysis (see Additional File 4). Array data were further validated by generating MA-plots, graphical representations of log ratio of the average normalised data from
control samples compared to xenobiotic-exposed coun-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/266

terparts against the fluorescence intensity [24] (see Additional File 5). The control samples were of high quality by
this measure. For example, when compared to the Cd
exposure controls, >99% of the genes exhibiting an
acceptable signal had <1.8-fold variance in expression
(and >97.5% showed a <1.4-fold variance). In contrast,
for hybridisations involving mRNA from animals exposed
to 500 μg/kg Cd, ~5% of genes showed an expression
change >1.8-fold with respect to the controls (with 15%
changing >1.4-fold) (Additional File 5). Further, a group
of reporters showed very significant up-regulation in
response to Cd. Annotations for these reporters indicated
that they included clusters encoding various metallothionein isoforms, a gene set previously shown to be
highly Cd responsive (Additional File 5) [13-15].

for each chemical exposure, together with the number of true (independent) biological replicates, each replicate consisting of 8

contained 8 replicates, and each of the treatment conditions (i.e. chemical and dose) contained 5 replicates. The design of the
array experiment shows the labelling, hybridisation and analysis steps for each biological replication.

Gene expression changes through the L. rubellus lifecycle
Transcript profiles were compared for 14 control groups
of juveniles and biological replicate groups of adults (16
groups). These groups were derived from a common stock
and selected to minimise the possible confounding effects
of seasonal variation (details of experimental conditions
and treatment metadata for each array have been submitted with the array data; for details see ArrayExpress: EMAXD-36). After initial pre-processing of the data, including normalisation relative to the median gene expression
in juveniles and adults combined, both principal component analysis and hierarchical condition clustering (HCC)
indicated a primary separation of samples based on developmental stage. Intriguingly, a further separation was
observed within the adult samples. This separated the
samples into two groups that accorded with the time of
year the adults were harvested from culture for experimental use in the laboratory experiment (Figure 4). Earthworms for two experiments (with Cd and FLA) were
harvested in November and those for the third (with ATZ)
were harvested in late December. Transcript profiling may
therefore also be able to provide molecular signatures
relating to seasonally-responsive biology and behaviour.

Substantive differences were evident between the juvenile
and adult groups, with ~45% of the reporters that consistently generated features passing automated and manual
quality criteria yielding measurements showing >1.4-fold
expression change between the two conditions. A t-test
identified 747 genes with significantly altered transcript
levels (p < 0.01 following Bonferroni multiple sample correction; a full list is provided in Additional File 5). Using
only these significantly changed genes, HCC separated all
samples by developmental stage (Figure 4). Annotation of
genes with changed expression levels between juveniles
and adults indicated that transcripts associated with macromolecular biosynthesis, energy production, and connective tissue synthesis (all processes associated with
rapid growth rate) were over-expressed in juveniles (Additional file 6). Also over-expressed in juveniles was an
invertebrate oxygen-carrier, erythrocruorin, which
showed up to 5-fold bias. Genes with higher expression in
adults reflected activities associated with turnover of cellular components, including biopolymer metabolism,
catabolism, and hydrolase activities. Multiple isoforms of
ferritin heavy chain (FTH1) were over-expressed 50- to
100-fold in adults. Although a library was constructed
from the anterior segments (segments 1–33) to sample
from reproductive tissues (clitellum, spermathecae and
ovaries; Table 1: Library 4) we were not able to identify
many transcripts associated with the biological process of
sexual reproduction. A notable and intriguing exception is
an homologue of the estrogen receptor co-activator
(LRC06848) which, although originally identified from
the juvenile library (Table 1: Library 3), did show a mean

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/266

>3-fold, and statistically significant, increase in expression
level in the adult samples.
While assessment of GOSlim annotations of individual
clusters by library yielded similar patterns of inference as
to biology (see Figure 2), the granularity of the EST dataset
made it a far less sensitive probe of animal physiology
than the microarray analyses. Importantly, the microarrays permitted assessment of expression of genes sampled
only a few times in the EST strategy.
Transcript responses of L. rubellus to xenobiotic exposure
Dose-response transcription profiles were determined for
three xenobiotics from different chemical classes: inorganic (cadmium), organic (fluoranthene), and agrochemical (atrazine) (details of experimental conditions and
design are available in ArrayExpress accessions E-MAXD34, -31 & -36 respectively). Those data passing quality
control criteria were analysed as independent compound
exposures employing a standard normalisation, followed
by filtering to select those reporters that passed automated
and manual quality criteria and showed a >1.4-fold
expression change in all conditions. This dataset was scrutinised further to identify statistically significant expression changes. Gene lists for each compound exposure are
given in Additional Files 7, 8 and 9. The resultant transcript profiles for replicate samples for each exposure concentration for each compound were hierarchically
clustered (Figures 5, 6, 7, Panels A), the average transcript
profiles computed for each exposure condition (Figures 5,
6, 7, Panels B), and key genes providing functional
insights into the response profile identified (Figures 5, 6,
7, Panels C) (see Additional files 10, 11 &12).

For each compound, samples from the same exposure
condition were more closely related to each other than to
other doses (Figures 5, 6, 7, Panels A). The only exception
was seen in FLA, where the groups exposed to the two
highest concentrations (158 and 533 ppm) are intermixed, but clustered separately from the remaining exposure conditions (Figure 6, Panel A). For all compounds,
HCC analysis indicated a second tier of clustering, separating controls from the two lower doses and both of these
groups from all replicates for the two higher doses. Since
all exposure experiments were designed with a logarithmic dose series across the full sub-lethal exposure range
(see Figure 3), this similarity in clustering pattern may
reflect similar patterns in transcript change associated
with the extent of toxic effects.
Molecular insights into xenobiotic response pathways
In our study, earthworms were maintained in the presence
of each chemical for a relatively long period (28 days)
compared to more standard, acute assays (usually 48
hours on filter paper or 14 days in soil). This extended

Analysis of differential transcription between adult and juvenile earthworms. Panel A presents a Principal Component Analysis of transcript profiles from adult and juvenile earthworms. The array data used for this analysis were normalised
using per chip and per gene median polishing, and data from poor quantity spots were removed; no additional filtering was performed. Panel B displays hierarchical clustering (using a distance algorithm for both conditions and genes) for genes showing

exposure was intended to permit the measurement of
transcriptome responses at a physiological acclimated plateau rather than in a dynamic flux state associated with the
initial exposure stress. We have mined these transcriptional changes to provide insights, some established and
some novel, into the mode of action of each xenobiotic.
Since our array only reports on a subset of the complete L.
rubellus transcriptome, and does not address alternative
splicing or posttranscriptional modifications, the insights

derived are by default fragmented. Inevitably, our analysis
exploits primarily a small proportion of well annotated
genes, including invariant controls (Figure 8, Panels A and
B) and compound responsive transcripts (Figure 8, Panels
C and D). However, the majority of genes that show statistically significant relationships between xenobiotic
dose and transcript levels do not have informative similarity to known proteins (Figure 8, Panels E and H). While
we can annotate these genes as 'regulated by xenobiotic

molecular functions and relationships as key avenues for

Cadmium: a response to inorganic exposure
Cadmium is a recognised carcinogen with a well described
underlying molecular aetiology (for reviews see [25-27]).
It has been shown to induce oxidative damage, modulate
DNA repair and interfere with metabolism of essential
metal ions, including Fe, Ca, and Zn, in yeast and cultured
cells. For L. rubellus the annotated cDNA microarray identified dose dependent transcript profiles congruent with
these molecular mechanisms, together with tantalising
novel insights into the secondary impacts of chronic Cd
exposure on the earthworm.

The cluster of transcripts exhibiting the most significant
dose dependent induction in response to cadmium were
members of the key protective and detoxification pathway
for Cd, namely, isoforms of the small, cysteine-rich,
metal-binding protein, metallothionein (Figure 5, Panel
C). The role of transcriptional up-regulation of metallothionein isoforms in cellular detoxification of cadmium
in earthworms has been well characterised [9,13,15]. The
induction profile was confirmed by QPCR analysis on
independently transcribed samples of the total RNA used
for microarray analysis (Figure 9). The highly significant
correlation (R = 0.965 p < 0.005) of the microarray and
QPCR data within the experiment, and the agreement
with the previous independent studies cited above, provides confirmation of the validity of our microarray findings.

Cd also inhibits the electron transport chain, and causes
the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It has
been proposed that the specific sites of impact of Cd are
in complexes II (ubiquinone oxidoreductase) and III
(cytochrome c), with the majority of ROS production
being associated with the inhibition of complex III [28].
The array results supported this model, showing a significant dose-dependent reduction of a cytochrome c oxidase
from complex III, and a modulation of the expression of
NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase II and cytochrome b
(although the latter effects are dose specific) (Figure 5,
Panel C). The observed inductions of a cytochrome P450
and glutathione-S transferase (GST) alpha by Cd (Figure
5, Panel C) are perhaps a response to ROS-induced damage, and have previously been observed in yeast and rat
liver, respectively [29,30]. Intriguingly, the induction of
the cellular response cascade to Cd-induced oxidative
damage has been linked to increased levels of the transcription factor Nrf2 through direct Cd interference with

ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis [31]. The earthworm array
indicates a transcriptional down-regulation of an ubiquitin specific protease (Figure 5, Panel C), and it will be
important to establish whether this inhibition is linked to
modulation of Nrf2 degradation.
Although at high concentrations Cd may impact on DNA
directly, causing DNA conformational alterations, at
lower levels it causes cytotoxic effects through inhibition
of DNA repair [32]. Cd affects both early and late steps of
nucleotide excision repair, and also inhibits repair of DNA
strand breaks and post-replication mismatch repair. However, the exact mechanisms underlying these effects have
not been described. Our data may provide a novel insight
into this process, as L. rubellus genes with significant similarity to RAD51 [33] and XPA [34], key components of
repair pathways for double stranded DNA breaks and excision repair respectively, are down-regulated in response to
Cd (Figure 5, Panel C). Since both RAD51 and XPA asso-

ciate with Zn it is conceivable that Cd may disrupt or
inhibit these key components of the DNA repair pathway
through molecular mimicry. It will be important to confirm these observations within other species.
As established in model species, molecular mimicry arguably provides the most wide-ranging vehicle through
which Cd can elicit toxic effects on a biological system.
Ca, Zn and Fe are all employed as key cofactors in proteins
that function as structural components, second messengers, transcriptional regulators and redox centres. The
binding of Cd to these metallo-proteins will have wideranging effects. The established link between Cd toxicity
and disruption of Fe metabolism leading to anaemia was
reflected within the array data through the significant
down-regulation of heavy chain ferritin (Figure 5, Panel
C). Whether this is a direct effect of Cd or a result of disruption of general Fe homeostatic sensing (through the
known interaction of Cd with the iron regulatory protein

[35]) is unclear. The impact of Cd on Ca metabolism was
evident on the arrays as a negative transcriptional influence on the Ca-binding proteins calcineurin, calexcitin
and sarcoplasmic Ca-binding protein (SCBP2) (Figure 5,
Panel C). Furthermore, the long-term effects of Cd on the
cytoskeleton [36] were also reflected in the Cd-specific upregulation of tropomyosin 2 (Figure 5, Panel C).
Fluoranthene: a representative polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbon toxin
PAHs are lipophilic and so can incorporate into and disrupt the functions of biological membranes [37]. Lowlevel exposure to PAH has been linked to several adverse
effects, including carcinogenesis [38], teratogenesis [39],
and induction of cardiovascular disease [40,41]. In mammals the molecular trigger coordinating cellular responses
to certain PAHs is the upregulation of aryl hydrocarbon
receptor (AhR) activity. This activation is not mediated
transcriptionally, but results from reduction of the prote-

olytic turnover of AhR by the ubiquitin-26S proteasome
pathway [42]. In L. rubellus, exposure to our model PAH,
FLA, caused the down-regulation of two members of this
proteolytic pathway, proteasome 26S sub-unit ATPase 1
and 26S proteasome regulatory sub-unit P28 (Figure 6,
Panel C). A second regulatory mechanism is moderation
of an AhR – heat shock protein 90 complex by FK506binding proteins (FKBP) [42]. In L. rubellus, FLA exposure
caused a >30-fold down-regulation of one FKBP isoform
(Figure 6, Panel C). These observations suggest that L.
rubellus orchestrates its response to FLA through these
established mechanisms.
AhR is a transcriptional regulator. Specific inhibition of
degradation increases the cellular concentration of AhR,
and thus causes transcriptional up-regulation of a set of

target metabolic and detoxification mechanisms. Classically these responses have been associated by the induction of cytochrome P450 reductases, but recently
alternative metabolic pathways have been identified,
including GSTs and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductases
[43]. In L. rubellus exposed to FLA, this detoxification
response is exemplified by the up-regulation of a homologue to a Pi class GST, a cytosolic isoform that has previously been linked to PAH metabolism [44] (Figure 6,
Panel C). AhR independent pathways activated by PAH
include those involving early growth response factor 1
and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor alpha
[45,46].
Biotransformation of PAH leads to the generation of reactive oxygenated metabolites (ROM) and ROM-mediated

oxidative stress [43]. This process activates a broad spectrum of pathways associated with inflammation and
hypoxia. This is reflected through the up-regulation of factors involved in the positive regulation of global transcription, including homologues of hABT1, Churchill protein
and CGI-13 (Figure 6, Panel C). A specific link has been
established between the activation of hypoxia-inducible
erythropoietin and the activation pathways under the
control of NFkB [42,47]. NFkB serves as a second messenger to induce a series of cellular cytokines in the response
to cellular damage invoked by, amongst others, reactive
oxygen species generated by PAH exposure. The observed
up-regulation of a CGI-13 protein homolog, a putative
NFkB activating protein, in response to FLA exposure supports the assertion that the earthworm is responding to
ROM-induced stress (Figure 6, Panel C).
The direct cellular impacts of PAHs have been associated
with: (1) mitochondrial dysfunction or decay leading to
the uncoupling of mitochondrial respiration, and inhibiting electron transport; (2) direct genotoxic damage
through DNA adduct formation; and, (3) hypoxia and

ROS and ROM generation [42,43]. All three processes are
clearly evident in the earthworm transcript response profiles. The mitochondrial-encoded genes NADH dehydrogenase subunits 1,2 & 4, cytochrome b, and cytochrome c
oxidase subunit II, showed significant down-regulation,
with those involved in DNA damage repair, such as
BTBD3 protein and APEX nuclease (multifunctional DNA
repair enzyme) 1, were significantly up-regulated (Figure
6, Panel C).
Overwhelmingly, the responses observed within the
earthworm are comparable with studies performed in
mammalian systems. However, one area where these
annelids show a distinct difference is in the down-regulation of microsomal-based metabolic machinery, including phase I (cytochrome P450 mixed function oxygenase
(MFO) enzymes) and phase II (including GST) detoxification reactions. Significantly, homologues of two microsomal GSTs show significant down-regulation (Figure 6,
Panel C). Furthermore, no homologue of cytochrome
P450 isoform 1A (CYP1A) has so far been identified in L.
rubellus. This finding is supported by a number of studies

Page 13 of 21

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:266

in earthworms [48,49] which did not observe an increase
in enzyme activity using assays which target microsomal
cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in biotransformation
of organic xenobiotics (CYP1A activity, measured using
the EROD assay). However, other studies have shown
induction of CYP1A (through measuring CYP1A immunopositive protein) in invertebrates, such as molluscs, following exposure to organic chemicals [50,51]. While the
role of the cytochrome P450 MFO system is well understood in vertebrates, the data presented here suggest that
there is a subtly distinct, hitherto undescribed variant
mechanism active in L. rubellus.
Atrazine: an S-triazine-ring herbicide
Compared to the significant body of research relating to
the gross toxicology of ATZ (see PAN Pesticides Database
[52] for literature review of toxicity and ecotoxicity data),
very little is known of the molecular pathways underlying
these physiological effects. It has been proposed that ATZ
breakdown is linked to standard organic phase I and
phase II metabolic pathways, implying that cytochrome
P450 reductases and GST may be invoked as the primary
detoxification mechanisms. This proposition is supported
by the L. rubellus data, which indicated transcriptional upregulation of representative P450 and GST isoforms (Figure 7, Panel C).

ATZ is classed as a potential carcinogen with teratogenic
activity [53]. On exposure to ATZ, L. rubellus showed upregulation of a number of genes that are associated with
DNA damage, such as UV excision repair protein RAD23
homologue B and HUS1 like protein (HUS1 checkpoint
protein). Furthermore, enzymes directly involved specifically in UV-responsive excision repair are also up-regulated, along with genes involved with chromatin
remodelling (Figure 7, Panel C). An impact on the transcript levels of genes involved in controlling the cell cycle
was also observed. This may indicate a link to mechanisms that control cell cycle progression in response to
genetic integrity of the cell (Figure 7, Panel C).
As an herbicide, the mode of action of ATZ is the disruption of electron transport by targeting chloroplast photosystem II. Inhibition occurs at the level of protein-bound
plastoquinone B [54]. The response of L. rubellus to ATZ
measured on the arrays indicated a significant up-regulation of several members of the oxidative phosphorylation
pathway and of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (Figure 7,
Panel C). This may indicate that, at high doses, ATZ elevates mitochondrial electron transport and alternative
routes of ATP generation to compensate for a partial
uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation.
However, in the L. rubellus response to ATZ, the largest
and most significantly overrepresented group of genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/266

were associated with protein synthesis and catabolism
(Figure 7, Panel C). The up-regulation by ATZ of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 which is central for the targeting of protein for degradation in concert with
ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s) via the HECT pathway is
indicative of this raised catabolic state [55]. This was
counterbalanced by observation of increases in a large
number of genes associated with up-regulated protein
synthesis such as ribosomal proteins and amino acid
transporters. A possible explanation for these observations might be an increase in the generation of incorrectly
folded proteins. Degradation of these non-functional proteins and their re-synthesis would account for the transcript changes observed.

Conclusion
A thirty-fold accretion in the genetic knowledge-base for
any species belonging to an acknowledged keystone taxon
that has been previously neglected in sequencing studies
might reasonably be expected to yield general and specific
insights into individual species and group systematics.
Indeed, a recent phylogenetic revision of the animal kingdom, partly based on the L. rubellus ESTs, defining 8,129
gene objects generated as a component of this work,
clearly grouped earthworms with flatworms and molluscs
in a superphylum, the Lophotrochozoa, alongside the
superphylum Ecdysozoa, to form one of the two major
animal divisions, the Protostomia [56,57]. The sequencing work described here has, thus, already made a valued
contribution to understanding the evolutionary relationships between animal phyla.
The availability and functional annotation of the EST
resource, and the subsequent clustering to identify a set of
gene objects has allowed the first high density microarray
for L. rubellus to be fabricated. The development of this
8,000-feature array provides a valuable resource to the
earthworm community for future studies in areas such as
tissue regeneration and immune system function, for
which earthworms are already in use as model systems
[58,59]. Through experimental studies, we have clearly
demonstrated the capacity of the microarray to provide
novel insights by investigating the molecular basis of the
responses of the species to environmental perturbations.
All our data and analyses have been collated and presented on a web-available database, LumbriBASE [19],
that permits querying of sequence, annotation and microarray data through an easy-to navigate interface. These
analyses promise radical changes in the use of earthworms
for the biological assessment of soil contamination. Thus,
not only have we revealed differences in the qualitative
and quantitative expression patterns of a high proportion
(~40 to 50%) of all L. rubellus genes following exposure to
three chemicals of contrasting modes of action, but it has
also provided novel molecular insights that complement

the outcomes of previous, targeted functional biochemical and metabolomics studies on this species [5,13]. With
this expanding set of tools now available, it can only be
assumed that L. rubellus will increasingly be viewed as a
powerful tool through which to probe, with an evolutionary perspective, the biochemical, physiological and evolutionary responses of a 'soil engineering' species to
environmental perturbations and changes.

a 1:1:1 mix of loam soil:peat:composted bark for a minimum of 4 weeks. Two weeks before the start of each experiment, all required worms were transferred to a standard
loam soil (pH 7.1, 5% organic matter) (Broughton
Loams, Kettering, UK) with 3% composted bark (LBS
Horticultural, Colne, UK) added and maintained at 15–
20°C under a 16:8 light:dark regime to allow them to
acclimatise to the test soil and conditions.

Worms used for generation of the control library and
body section libraries were selected following acclimatisation without further treatment. These were keyed out to
confirm species identification and a set of healthy individuals dissected if required and then processed for total RNA
extractions. Breeding pairs of adults were assembled and
placed on clean soil and checked every four weeks and
laid cocoons collected. A random selection of these
cocoons were incubated for a further five weeks before
being dissected and the embryonic tissue collected for use
in constructing the late cocoon library. The remaining
cocoons were hatched and the worms grown for ~40 days
to yield a juvenile cohort for library construction. Libraries made using exposed worm tissue were made from preacclimatised adults kept in cadmium (Cd; 50, 200 and
600 ppm), fluoranthene (FLA; 62, 140, 316, 711 and
1066 ppm), atrazine (ATZ; 12 and 35 ppm) and copper
(Cu; 40, 160, 460 and 480 ppm) spiked, bark-amended
loam soil for 28 days.
The same amended loam soil was used to generate sample
for all microarray experiments. Juvenile samples were
obtained from worms grown individually from hatching
[60]. These were monitored until each reached approximately 300 mg weight at which time they were snap frozen at a designated diurnal time and then processed for
microarray analysis.

Cd: 0, 13, 43, 148, 500

AZ: 0, 9.4, 20.7, 35, 59.
Eight replicate of controls and five replicates of spiked
treatments were used for each experiment. Cd was spiked
into soil in the water that was required to raise the soil
moisture content to the required level (33% wet weight =
approximately 60% of water holding capacity), fluoranthene and atrazine were spiked as solutions in acetone
and ethanol, respectively. Each soil, including treatment
controls, was amended with the required amount of
"make-up" solvent to ensure that all soils received the
same volume of solvent as the highest concentration.
After dosing, all soils were vented for at 72 hours to allow
evaporation of the carrier. Soil were then wetted to the
same moisture level used in the Cd test.
The adult test was conducted according to a 28 day protocol [60] using the design outlined in Figure 3. For logistic
reasons (principally the need for time-synchronised sampling), the experiments for each compound were run in
series rather than parallel, and thus the tests were conducted at different times of the year. Exposures of batches
of 8 worms per treatment replicate were conducted for 28
days at 15°C under a 16 hr light: 8 hr dark regime. Each
batch of worms was fed at 0 and 14 days with 5 g (dry
weight) of horse manure spiked to the same concentration as the test soil. After 28 days, at an identical designated diurnal time (midday ± 30 min), worms were
retrieved from the soil, immediately snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen, and stored at -80°C. During processing each
worm was visually inspected for phenotypic characters
(presence of skin lesions, scarring of the clitellum, presence of body constrictions, loss of torpor, and reduced
vigour) and given a "condition index" score ranging from
1 (pristine) to 5 (very poor for many characters). Percent
survival of the experimental cohort was recorded and the
soils sieved to collect cocoons in order to determine reproductive rate. For each experimental replicate, three worms
were pooled to give a single biological sample for array
analysis. The worms chosen were the three that had the
highest condition score at the end of the test. Although
this selection may have favoured the inclusion of more
tolerant genotypes, it avoided the inclusion of worms that

had lost condition for non-treatment reasons (such as disease or parasitism) during exposure.
Total RNA extractions
All fresh tissue was immediately homogenized in Tri-reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) and stored at -80°C before processing. Stored tissue was crushed to fine powder under liquid
nitrogen and homogenised in Tri-reagent at 50 mg per ml
(Sigma Chemicals, Poole, UK) for 2 minutes at high speed
using an Ultra-Turret® T18 homogeniser (IKA, Stauffer,
Germany). Total RNA was extracted using standard protocols [61,62] followed by additional purification with
RNAeasy kits (Qiagen), and quantification by spectrophotometry.
Library construction and screening
Nine cDNA libraries were constructed from control (unexposed) and exposed animals (Table 1 and Additional File
1). Library 1 was constructed from healthy control adults.
Library 2 was constructed from embryonic material collected from pair breed cocoons (see above), and Library 3
from juveniles, each obtained from hatchlings reared
from laid cocoons. A separate cDNA library (Library 4)
was constructed from the anterior (pre-clitellum) portion
of healthy adults. Representative, healthy individuals
from each concentration of each xenobiotic exposure
were processed to generate total RNA. Xenobiotic compound-specific RNA pools were then constructed by combining an equal mass of RNA from each dose. These pools
were then used to construct additional cDNA libraries: Cd
Library 5, FA Library 6, AZ Library 7 and Cu Library 8.
mRNA for these libraries was purified using oligo d(T) cellulose columns (Amersham Life Sciences). Libraries in the
plasmid vector pBluescript II (Libraries 2–8), were generated using the pBluescript II XR cDNA library kit (Stratagene). Library 1 was generated in the phagemid
pBluescript II SK+ (Stratagene), and subsequently recovered as plasmid (pBluescript II SK+) by mass excision. A
suppression subtractive hybridisation library (Library 9)
was also generated (using the Clontech PCR-Select cDNA
subtraction method) to enrich for genes involved in
reproduction with driver cDNA generated from posterior
segments and tester cDNA from the segments containing
the clitellum and seminal vesicles. The population of
amplified enriched fragments was ligated into pGEM-T
(Promega).
EST sequencing
Plasmid clones were picked, cultured and cDNA inserts
amplified by PCR using vector primers in a final volume
of 100 μl following standard methods [63]. Products were
purified, and the sample concentrated to 20 μl, using
Montage Multiscreen PCR Cleanup Plates (Millipore).
The PCR products were sequenced from the 5' end of the
cDNA insert using a T7 primer and BigDye and Dyenami-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/266

cET sequencing reagents, and analysed on an ABI 3730
sequencer by the Edinburgh School of Biological Sciences
Sequencing Service.
To improve the yield of novel sequences, a screen was
introduced to remove unsuccessful insert cDNA amplifications and highly abundant transcripts. The success of
each amplification was first verified by visualisation on 96
well 2% E-gels (Invitrogen) and subsequently an aliquot
of each amplicon was printed on an array and hybridised
(as described below) to a fluorescently labelled mixture
representing the 50 most abundant transcripts identified
in the first 3966 L. rubellus ESTs. The longest EST representative of the 50 clusters containing the greatest number
of ESTs was selected and insert cDNAs labelled in 10
batches. For each mix of 5 probes, 0.2 μl of a 1/100 dilution of each probe insert was PCR amplified using primers
designed to the vector/adaptor interface. In this labelling
PCR mix, added dTTP was reduced to 0.3 nmoles and 1 μl
of Cy5-dUTP (Amersham) was added. Unincorporated
dye was removed using GFX columns (Amersham) and
the products eluted in 60 μl. A mixture (1 μl of each
batch) of the abundant transcript probes was hybridised
to the arrayed PCR products in the presence of the amplification primers to reduce cross hybridisation. cDNA
inserts that had good amplification but did not hybridise
to the abundant transcript probes were picked robotically
to new microtitre plates (Multiprobe II HT EX liquid handling system, Parkard) and processed for sequencing (see
above). The 100 μl volume PCR amplifications yielded
sufficient product for quality assurance and sequencing
(~15 μl) and a large stock for subsequent microarray fabrication.
EST processing and annotation
Primary
chromatograms were
processed using
trace2dbEST, a perl pipeline script that uses Phil Green's
phred and user-supplied cut-off information to base call
and trim sequences, formatting them for submission to
GenBank dbEST. All 17,225 ESTs have been submitted.
The ESTs were then clustered and annotated using PartiGene [17]. PartiGene first groups ESTs into clusters that
putatively derive from one transcript using CLOBB [64],
and then derives a consensus sequence for each cluster
with Phil Green's phrap. The EST translation tool
prot4EST [18] was used to predict putative protein translations for each consensus sequence. Each consensus was
compared to the UniProt protein database [65], and to
custom databases of other annelid and model organism
sequences, using BLAST [66]. Further annotations were
derived using GOtcha, which provides gene ontology
annotation with robust quality scoring [21], and modules
in the annot8r series (Ralf Schmid and M. Blaxter, in
press) that provide annotations referring to protein
domains and families (via Pfam and Interpro) [67],

PSort and SigP) [68,69], physical properties (via ExPasy)
[70], and secondary structural predictions (using e.g.
TmHMM).

selection of heterologous gene reporters which show no
cross reactivity to earthworm transcripts (data not
shown). Reporters were cross-linked to the surface by baking at 80°C for 2 hours, and UV cross linking. Slides were
stored in the dark and under a vacuum until required.

A unified database: LumbriBASE
All the sequence data and associated annotations were
collated in a PostgreSQL relational database called LumbriBASE [19]. The database was also populated with postprimary analysis microarray expression data (see below),
and was used in intensive data exploration. Public access
to the database is provided through a scripted internetaccesible interface using PHP, CGI and java scripts. LumbriBASE also houses analyses of EST data from other annelids derived from submissions to GenBank dbEST: the
earthworm Eisenia andrei (1108 ESTs), the polychaete
Nereis virens (6978) (Olive and Blaxter, unpublished
data), and the leech Haementeria depressa (891 ESTs).

Microarray probe preparation
The Lucida Scorecard test spike (Amersham Life Sciences)
was added to 10 μg of total sample RNA prior to oligod(T) reverse transcription and coupling to Cy3 using an
indirect amino amyl procedure [71]. Labelled targets were
separated from unincorporated dye by precipitation and
separation on a GFX column (Amersham Life Sciences).
Yields of cDNA and incorporated dye were calculated by
measuring absorption at 260 and 550 nM. The quality of
the labelled targets was assessed subjectively by separation
on a 2% agarose gel poured on a microscope slide and visualised using a LSIV laser scanner. Only labels that demonstrated fluorescent incorporation in a wide size range of
cDNAs and where incorporation efficacy exceeded 20
pmole CyDye/μg cDNA were used for hybridisation [71].

Microarray experimental design
A reference design was employed for profiling L. rubellus
transcript expression levels. The reference sample consisted of 65–70 base-long oligonucleotides designed
against vector sequences found between the amplification
primer and the inserted cDNA. The sequences of these
primers are given in Additional File 2. An equimolar
quantity of two oligonucleotides was used in order to represent the three different vectors exploited for library construction. Use of this reference meant that essentially all
reporter spots could be called as positively hybridising in
the reference, extending the ability of the array to report
on even low hybridisation signals in the experimental
samples. In addition, as this reference could be easily
chemically synthesised and therefore replicated, this
design permitted comparison of all samples against a
common reference within the present experiment, and
can be extended for future work. The hybridisation probe
included ~30 pmol of Cy3 labelled target RNA and 1
pmol of each oligonucleotide.
Microarray fabrication
A representative EST (usually the one inferred to be the
longest) was selected from each of the 8,029 clusters
assembled from EST sequence data. Aliquots (5 μl) of the
amplified and concentrated products were transferred to
384 well plates and mixed with an equal volume of
DMSO. These composite plates were then used to print
onto Ultra-GAP glass slides (Corning) using 48 SMP3 pins
(Telecham) mounted in a Spotarray 72 (Perkin-Elmer).
This printing regime yield spots of approximately 120 μm
in diameter. Landmarks were introduced at the left had
corner of each sub-array (and thus evenly spaced across
the whole array) by the introduction of 5 replicates of the
Lucida Scorecard (Amersham). The Lucida Scorecard is a

Microarray hybridisation and quality control
Slides were pre-treated by immersion at 42°C in block
buffer (5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS and 1% BSA) for 45 min. Slides
were then washed in 0.2 μm filter-sterilised water and
dried using compressed air. Labelled target (representing
30 pmole of Cy3) was mixed with the common reference
(representing 30 pmole of Cy5) and 0.1 nmoles of oligo
d(T)17 before denaturation at 95°C for 3 min. This was
immediately introduced onto the slide surface in the presence of 50% formamide, 10 × SSC and 0.2% SDS in a total
volume of 40 μl. A second slide was applied to the surface
of the array in such a way as to exclude air bubbles and the
hybridisation completed in a humidity chamber at 42°C
overnight (18 hr). Slides were separated in 1 × SSC, 0.2%
SDS at room temperature and washed in the same buffer
for 10 min at 55°C. They were subsequently washed twice
in 0.1 × SSC, 1% SDS at 55°C prior to a final room-temperature rinse in 0.1 × SSC. Slides were dried with compressed air and an array image acquired using a ScanArray
Express (Perkin-Elmer).

Analysis of calibrators exploited 10 "alien" RNA spikes
(components of the Amersham Lucidea Scorecard) introduced at known concentrations, between 1 pmole and 30
nmole, prior to labelling and each hybridizing to 10 replicate reporter spots on the array. Image analysis of the signals generated by these reporters was performed for each
array to determine the sensitivity and relationship
between RNA concentration and fluorescent signal.
Hybridisations showing non-linear response, or where
the detection limit was below the 10 pmole Lucidea ScoreCard calibrator, were removed from subsequent analysis

(For representative calibrator analysis, see Additional File
3).
Statistical analysis of microarray data
Array images were subjectively quality controlled for artefacts that would compromise quantification such as background effects and spot morphology. Subsequently, the
calibration standards from the Lucida Scorecard were analysed to objectively assess the sensitivity range and to
define both saturation and background readings. The
images were analysed using Imagene (Biodiscovery),
using the default flagging and segmentation settings, and
subsequently checked by eye. All subsequent analysis was
performed in GeneSpring 7.3 (Agilent Technologies, Palo
Alto, CA). Array data passing these quality standards were
processed by background subtraction and generation of
Cy3/Cy5 ratio. Data was then normalised within an experiment using median polishing (per gene and per chip)
normalization implemented using the default method
within GeneSpring Software (Agilent Technologies, Palo
Alto, CA) incorporating only data where Imagene had
flagged the spot good (0 flag) and the background-subtracted data exceeded 100 relative light units. Where
appropriate, data was also normalised by dividing by data
derived from the relevant biological controls. The processed data distributions were visualised using a box plot to
establish whether each chip's data distribution exhibited
comparable median and quartile ranges, and data not
complying was further reviewed for the quality for the raw
data. Any data compromised by experimental artefacts
was removed from the analysis (Box plots for each experiment are given in Additional File 4).

All statistical analyses within an experiment were performed on subsets of genes where the data was flagged as
good in a number of arrays representing at least the minimum biological replicate size. In this way, poor data was
removed without thereby removing genes that were only
significantly expressed in one experimental condition.
Further filtering was performed prior to statistical analysis
to remove genes that displayed less than a 1.4 fold change
to any condition within the experiment to minimise false
discovery. Statistical tests used and their parameters are
presented with the relevant data. Annotation used for
analysis was generated from LumbriBASE (see above).
Relevant abstractions of the annotation is provided for all
genes exhibiting significant transcript changes between
given biological conditions within Additional Files 5 and
6. These tables list most the significant homologue identified within the set of human proteins (from SwissProt),
the global protein database (UniProt) and the global
nucleotide database (EMBL) using BLASTX or BLASTN, as
appropriate, with an E-value cut-off for BLASTX of 1e-05,
and of 1e-65 for BLASTN. A brief description of the match,
its accession number and the BLAST score and E-value are

provided. Ontological bias analysis performed when analysing the developmental transcript changes exploited the
SwissProt accession numbers of those genes assigned a
human homologue genes within the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID)
environment [72].
PCR validation of individual gene expression profiles
Validation of array results focused on a confirmation of
expression patterns by real time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (Q-RT-PCR). Analysis by Q-RT-PCR was
conducted for two well characterised earthworms gene,
metallothionein-2 and β-actin, for which Q-RT-PCR primers were developed and fully validated in previous work
[62]. All quantifications were conducted using a cDNA
template generated from the sample extract of total RNA
used for the microarray hybridisation. Reverse transcription of a 2 μg sample of collected total RNA was conducted at 42°C, anchored by oligo (dT17) primer and
random hexamers (N6) and using Moloney-Murine Leukaemia Virus reverse transcriptase for second strand synthesis.

Q-RT-PCR quantification were conducted using custom
designed primers and the universal SYBR® Green Supermix
(BIO-RAD, UK). All reactions were optimised to yield an
exponential amplification of the target gene. Q-RT-PCR
quantification was conducted over 45 cycles off 30 sec at
95°C, 30 seconds at the primer specific annealing temperature (metallothionein-2 = 58°C and β-actin = 55°C) and
concluded by melting curve analysis to ensure to ensure
the presence of a single major amplification product.
Dilution of purified plasmid stocks were used as standards for quantification. Analysis of all samples was conducted in triplicate to provide a technical validation for
the quantification. Data were compared with expression
levels for the same genes measured through microarray
analysis. Within experiments, treatments were compared
for significant differences using Student's t-test.
