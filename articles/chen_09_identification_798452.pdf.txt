<p>An analysis of amphioxus miRNAs suggests an expansion of miRNAs played a key role in the evolution of chordates to vertebrates</p>
Amphioxus microRNAs

Abstract
Background: microRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene
expression at the post-transcriptional level. While the number of known human and murine
miRNAs is continuously increasing, information regarding miRNAs from other species such as
amphioxus remains limited.
Results: We combined Solexa sequencing with computational techniques to identify novel
miRNAs in the amphioxus species B. belcheri (Gray). This approach allowed us to identify 113
amphioxus miRNA genes. Among them, 55 were conserved across species and encoded 45 nonredundant mature miRNAs, whereas 58 were amphioxus-specific and encoded 53 mature miRNAs.
Validation of our results with microarray and stem-loop quantitative RT-PCR revealed that Solexa
sequencing is a powerful tool for miRNA discovery. Analyzing the evolutionary history of
amphioxus miRNAs, we found that amphioxus possesses many miRNAs unique to chordates and
vertebrates, and these may thus represent key steps in the evolutionary progression from
cephalochordates to vertebrates. We also found that amphioxus is more similar to vertebrates
than are tunicates with respect to their miRNA phylogenetic histories.
Conclusions: Taken together, our results indicate that Solexa sequencing allows the successful
discovery of novel miRNAs from amphioxus with high accuracy and efficiency. More importantly,
our study provides an opportunity to decipher how the elaboration of the miRNA repertoire that
occurred during chordate evolution contributed to the evolution of the vertebrate body plan.

Background

When the class of RNA regulatory genes known as microRNAs (miRNAs) was discovered it introduced a whole new
layer of gene regulation in eukaryotes [1]. Since the discovery
of the first miRNA (lin-4) in Caenorhabditis elegans, thousands of miRNAs have been identified experimentally or
computationally from a variety of species [1]. miRNAs are
currently estimated to comprise 1 to 5% of animal genes and
collectively regulate up to 30% of genes, making them one of
the most abundant classes of regulators [2]. However, while
the importance of miRNAs in animal ontogeny has been rapidly elucidated, their role in phylogeny currently remains
largely unknown. Recent studies have provided important
clues indicating that these approximately 22-nucleotide noncoding RNAs might have been a causative factor in increasing
organismal complexity through their action in regulating
gene expression [3-6]. Indeed, vertebrates possess many
more miRNAs than any invertebrate sampled to date, and the
emergence of vertebrates is characterized by an unprecedented increase in the rate of miRNA family innovation [4-6].
However, how this increase in the miRNA repertoire relates
to the emergence of the complex vertebrate body plan is currently unclear because groups from which we might gain
insight into this (such as amphioxus) have not been thoroughly studied yet.
As the living invertebrate relative of the vertebrates, amphioxus affords the best available glimpse of a proximate invertebrate ancestor of the vertebrates and is likely to exemplify
many of the starting conditions at the dawn of vertebrate evolution [7,8]. The completion of the amphioxus genome
project provides a tremendous opportunity for identifying
miRNAs in this organism [9]. According to the rules proposed
by Ambros et al. [10] and Berezikov et al. [11], a genuine
miRNA should fulfill two basal requirements for miRNA
annotation: its expression should be confirmed experimentally (the expression criterion) and the putative miRNA
should be embedded within a canonical stem-loop hairpin
precursor (the structural criterion). Furthermore, an optional
but commonly used criterion is that the mature miRNA
sequence and the predicted hairpin structure should be conserved in different species. Non-conserved miRNAs require
more careful examination. In this work, we have proposed an
integrative strategy combining an experimental screen with
bioinformatic analysis to identify miRNAs fulfilling all these
requirements (Figure 1). Our strategy has four steps: investigating all small RNAs expressed in the amphioxus Branchiostoma belcheri (Gray) via Solexa, a massively parallel
sequencing technology [12]; computationally scanning the
amphioxus genome (Branchiostoma floridae v2.0) for candidate hairpin miRNA genes corresponding to Solexa reads
using MIREAP; identifying conserved miRNA genes using
miRAlign [13]; and distinguishing functional non-conserved
miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) from dysfunctional
pseudo-hairpins using MiPred [14]. Our approach allows the
simultaneous sequencing of up to 400,000 small RNA reads

in a lane, and enables the identification of both conserved
miRNAs and completely new miRNAs for which no close
homologs are known. Using this method, we obtained experimental evidence for 113 miRNA genes in the amphioxus B.
belcheri (Gray), of which 55 are conserved and 58 are amphioxus-specific. The genomic organization and evolution history of these amphioxus miRNAs were also characterized.

Results
Construction of a small RNA library by Solexa
sequencing
In order to identify the miRNAs in amphioxus, a small RNA
library from adult amphioxus was sequenced using Solexa
technology [12]. After removing the reads of low quality and
masking adaptor sequences, a total of 469,044 reads of 18 to
30 nucleotides in length were obtained. Solexa raw data are
available at Gene Expression Omnibus [GEO:GSE16859].
Intriguingly, the length distribution peaked at 22 nucleotides
and almost half of these clean reads (45.11%) were 22 nucleotides in length, consistent with the common size of miRNAs.
This result implies an enrichment of miRNA in the small RNA
library of amphioxus. Next, all Solexa reads were aligned
against the amphioxus genome (Branchiostoma floridae
v2.0) using SOAP (Short Oligonucleotide Alignment Program) [15] with a tolerance of one mismatch. The results indicated that 257,746 reads were perfectly matched to the
amphioxus genome and 65,647 reads differed from the
amphioxus genome by one nucleotide (323,393 reads in
total).
Subsequently, the amphioxus small RNAs were classified into
different categories according to their biogenesis and annotation (Table S1 in Additional data file 1). Among the 323,393
genome-matched reads, 3,420, 6,438, 210, and 12 were fragments of rRNA, tRNA, small nuclear RNA (snRNA), and
small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), respectively. These RNAs
were abandoned and the remaining 313,313 small RNAs were
retained for further analysis.

Selection of genuine miRNAs by computational
analysis
One of the important features that distinguish miRNAs from
other endogenous small RNAs is the ability of the pre-miRNA
sequence to adopt a canonical stem-loop hairpin structure
[10,11]. To determine whether these small RNA sequences
from amphioxus were genuine miRNAs, we scanned the
amphioxus genome (Branchiostoma floridae v2.0) for hairpin structures comprising the candidate miRNAs using our
in-house software MIREAP, which was specially designed to
identify genuine miRNAs from deeply sequenced small RNA
libraries. In total, our in silico analysis generated 133 loci
embedded within typical stem-loop structures (Table S2 in
Additional data file 1). After the removal of five loci that overlapped with protein-coding gene exons and four loci with free
energy lower than -20 kcal/mol (see the criteria listed in

Materials and methods), the remaining 124 loci were considered candidate miRNA genes (Table S3 in Additional data file
1).
Subsequently, we used miRAlign to identify miRNA genes of
amphioxus that are paralogs or orthologs to known miRNAs.
miRAlign is a computational approach that detects new miRNAs based on both sequence and structure alignment, and it
has better performance than other reported homolog searching methods [13]. We applied this method to the 124 candidate miRNA genes and detected 55 conserved miRNA genes

(Table 1; Table S5 in Additional data file 1; Additional data file
2). Among 55 miRNA genes, 36 are present as a single copy in
the amphioxus genome, while 9 have multiple copies distributed on the same or separate chromosomes that produce
identical mature miRNAs (Table 1). In total, 45 non-redundant mature miRNAs were encoded by these conserved
miRNA genes (Table 1; Table S4 in Additional data file 1).
Simultaneously, 27 miRNA*s were detected (Table 1; Table
S4 in Additional data file 1). Since the mature sequences for
miRNAs and miRNA*s are located at two opposite arms of the
hairpin [1], the detection of miRNA* sequences supports the

release of miRNA:miRNA* duplexes from the predicted stemloop structure. Among the 45 conserved miRNAs, 10 were
identical with known miRNAs, 8 had one nucleotide mismatch, 16 had two nucleotide differences, 5 contained three
mismatches, and 6 had 4 to 5 mismatches (Table S4 in Additional data file 1). All of these mismatches were located outside the 'seed' region (the core sequence that encompasses the
first two to eight bases of the mature miRNA). In contrast to
the amphioxus miRNAs, which showed high similarity to
miRNAs from other organisms (mismatches ≤ 3), most
amphioxus miRNA*s differed from the known miRNA* by
three to five nucleotides (data not shown). This result suggests that miRNA*s are less conserved than miRNAs.
Obviously, methods that rely on phylogenetic conservation of
the structure and sequence of a miRNA cannot predict nonconserved genes. However, a substantial number of speciesspecific miRNA genes have been found that escaped the
detection of comparative genomics approaches [16]. On the
other hand, although the hairpin structure is a necessary feature for the computational classification of genuine premiRNA, many random inverted repeats (termed pseudo-hairpins) in eukaryotic genomes can also fold into dysfunctional
hairpins [14,17]. Thus, additional care should be taken to classify functional non-conserved miRNAs. To overcome this
problem, several ab initio predictive approaches have been
extensively developed for identifying pre-miRNAs without
relying on phylogenetic conservation [14,17]. Here, we
adopted an ab initio prediction method named MiPred to distinguish pre-miRNAs from other similar segments in the
amphioxus genome [14]. Unlike comparative genomics
approaches, MiPred relies solely on secondary structure to
evaluate miRNA candidates and, therefore, can estimate species-specific miRNAs without knowing sequence homology
[14,17]. Furthermore, it has been reported that MiPred performs as well or significantly better (in terms of sensitivity
and specificity) than existing classifiers at distinguishing
non-conserved functional pre-miRNAs from genomic
pseudo-hairpins and non-pre-miRNAs (most classes of noncoding RNAs and mRNAs) [17]. Among the remaining 69 premiRNA-like hairpins, 11 were classified as pseudo-pre-miRNAs (Table S3 in Additional data file 1). Thus, the final collection of amphioxus-specific miRNA genes is composed of 58

loci (Table 1; Table S5 in Additional data file 1; Additional
data file 3) that encode 53 non-redundant mature miRNAs
(Table 1; Table S4 in Additional data file 1). Herein, we tentatively designate them bbe-miR-specific-1 (bbe-miR-s1), bbemiR-s2, bbe-miR-s3, bbe-miR-s4, and so on. Among these
amphioxus-specific miRNA genes, the miRNA* sequences of
18 genes were identified (Table 1; Table S4 in Additional data
file 1), further supporting their existence as miRNAs in
amphioxus.
The sequencing frequency of the miRNAs generally reflected
their relative abundance and was, therefore, used to establish
miRNA expression profiles (Table S4 in Additional data file
1). Although the 98 miRNAs (45 conserved + 53 non-conserved) and 45 miRNA*s were sequenced at varying frequencies, some miRNAs dominated the miRNA library. The
sequencing frequency of the four most abundantly expressed
miRNAs (miR-22, miR-1, let-7a and miR-25) constituted
78.82% of the total miRNA sequencing reads, suggesting that
they might be ubiquitously expressed in amphioxus. In contrast, the sequencing frequency of miR-129, miR-s53, miRs26, miR-s31, miR-s46, and so on was extremely low in our
library. It is possible that these miRNAs are expressed at very
low levels, in limited cell types, and/or under limited circumstances. Most miRNA*s showed weak expression (sequencing
frequency < 10) and their expression levels were much lower
than their corresponding miRNAs, consistent with the idea
that miRNA* strands are degraded rapidly during the biogenesis of mature miRNAs. Furthermore, although the number
of amphioxus-specific miRNAs was nearly equal to that of the
conserved miRNAs (Figure 2a), the absolute sequencing frequencies of the amphioxus-specific miRNAs was much lower
(Figure 2b). The miRNA size distribution ranged from 18 to
24 nucleotides, with 22 nucleotides the most abundant both
in number (50.70%) and sequencing frequency (89.23%)
(Figure 2c, d). Analysis of the nucleotides at the ends of these
miRNAs revealed that uridine (U) was the most common
nucleotide both at the 5' end (54.87%) and the 3' end
(64.60%).
In order to find more potential miRNAs in amphioxus,
unmapped small RNAs were directly compared with the miRBase release 12.0 [18]. The search criteria were more rigor-

ous, and required small RNAs to display a perfect or nearly
perfect match (mismatch ≤ 1) to published miRNAs. Moreover, the mismatches were required to be outside the 'seed'
region. Based on these principles, we identified eight candidate miRNAs (bbe-miR-21, bbe-miR-122, bbe-miR-192, and
so on). We considered these small RNAs to be plausible
amphioxus miRNAs (Table S6 in Additional data file 1). The
reason that these sequencing reads were successfully
matched to miRBase 12.0 but failed to match the B. floridae
genome might be due to incomplete genome sequencing in B.
floridae or to genomic divergence between B. belcheri (Gray)
and B. floridae.

Detection of amphioxus miRNA expression with stemloop quantitative RT-PCR and microarray analysis
To verify the existence of the newly identified amphioxus
miRNAs, the same RNA preparation used in the Solexa
sequencing was subjected to stem-loop quantitative RT-PCR
(qRT-PCR) assay [19,20]. In total, all 45 conserved miRNAs
and 50 out of 53 amphioxus-specific miRNAs (except bbe-

miR-s1, bbe-miR-s31 and bbe-miR-s46) could be readily
detected by stem-loop qRT-PCR. Figure 3a shows representative photographic images of the semi-quantitative RT-PCR.
As shown in the figure, bbe-miR-1, bbe-let-7, bbe-miR-25,
bbe-miR-22, and so on were clearly expressed in amphioxus.
Therefore, these miRNAs are authentic miRNAs. In sum,
these results suggest that Solexa sequencing is capable of successfully discovering novel miRNAs from this species with
high accuracy and efficiency.
Moreover, we detected the expression of the newly identified
miRNAs in amphioxus with microarray analysis [21]. Except
for the amphioxus-specific miRNAs and five miRNAs (bbemiR-71, bbe-miR-278, bbe-miR-252a, bbe-miR-252b, and
bbe-miR-281) whose homologs were not contained in the
available commercial microarray chips, 65% of the miRNAs
(26 out of 40) could be detected by microarray analysis, and
most undetected miRNAs had either low expression
(sequencing frequency < 100) or a low affinity to chip probes
(mismatches ≥ 3) (Table S7 in Additional data file 1). This

The data obtained from each of these methods were then compared with the data obtained from each of the
others and drawn as a Pearson correlation scatter plot.

result suggests that Solexa sequencing is a more specific tool
for identifying mature miRNAs than miRNA microarray analysis. Another discordant observation is that seven miRNAs
were detected in the microarray analysis but were undetected
by the Solexa sequencing (Table S7 in Additional data file 1).
These miRNAs need to be further validated in amphioxus.
Table S8 in Additional data file 1 lists the raw miRNA microarray data.
Although the Solexa sequencing, stem-loop qRT-PCR assay
and microarray analysis detected the same set of amphioxus
miRNAs, the expression levels measured by these three platforms might be somewhat inconsistent for certain miRNAs.
We chose nine miRNAs and compared their expression levels
as measured by these three platforms. These miRNAs were
selected because they could be detected by all three methods
and because they had high affinity to the chip probes (mismatches ≤ 1). As shown in Figure 3b, expression levels measured by microarray and qRT-PCR assay were quite
concordant, with a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) close to
1. In contrast, the levels measured by Solexa sequencing were
inconsistent with those determined by microarray and qRT-

PCR (Figure 3c, d). Thus, although Solexa sequencing is
approved to be an accurate and efficient strategy for miRNA
identification, it might be somewhat inferior to the more
commonly used quantitative methodologies (qRT-PCR and
microarray) for miRNA quantification. This discordance
might be due to cloning bias or to sequencing bias inherent in
the deep-sequencing approach. In addition, some miRNAs
might be hard to sequence due to physical properties or posttranscriptional modifications such as methylation.

miRNA gene clusters in the amphioxus genome
miRNAs are often present in the genome as clusters where
multiple miRNAs are aligned in the same orientation and
transcribed as a polycistronic structure, allowing them to
function synchronously and cooperatively [1]. Altuvia et al.
[22] demonstrated that 42% of known human miRNA genes
are arranged in clusters in the genome using a 3 kb threshold
between two miRNA genes. We followed the strategies proposed by Altuvia et al. and defined 3,000 nucleotides as the
maximal distance for two miRNA genes to be considered as
clustered. By this definition, we identified 45 miRNA genes
organized into 17 compact clusters, including 11 pairs, two tri-

plets, three tetrads and one group of five (Figure 4a). Some of
the amphioxus miRNA clusters are conserved within vertebrate species, implying an ancient origin conserved throughout the course of evolution. For example, the miR-183/miR96 cluster in amphioxus was also found in humans and
zebrafish (Figure 4a). In contrast, some clusters, such as the
miR-s4/miR-s5/miR-s6/miR-s7/miR-s8 cluster, seem to be
an amphioxus innovation (Figure 4a).

Previous studies have suggested that miRNA innovation is an
ongoing process [3-6]. The most crucial morphological innovations during evolution are closely linked to the specific
expression of a unique set of miRNA genes [3-6]. Herein, we
extended the earlier studies by integrating amphioxus miR-

rat and human miRNA information [18], 45 conserved
amphioxus miRNAs could be classified into three distinct
groups: 23 miRNAs (let-7a, miR-1, miR-7, miR-9, and so on)

The phylogenetic histories of amphioxus miRNAs. (a) miRNA gene clusters in amphioxus. At a 3,000-nucleotide distance threshold, the amphioxus
genome contains 17 compact clusters with 39 miRNAs. The precursor structure is indicated as a box, and the location of the miRNA within the precursor
is shown in black. Some of these clusters in amphioxus are also conserved in zebrafish and humans. (b) The evolutionary histories of miRNAs and their
relationship to the milestones of macroevolution. We integrated amphioxus miRNAs into the currently known miRNAs (miRBase release 12.0) and
performed a comprehensive screening of their phylogenetic histories across animals. Each miRNA was classified into one of four groups: miRNAs
conserved throughout bilaterian animals; homologs of invertebrate miRNAs; miRNAs present in both chordates and vertebrates; and homologs of
vertebrate miRNAs. Note that our approach ignored species-specific miRNAs, since these miRNAs do not offer any information about miRNA evolution.
(c) Comparison of the miRNA repertoires of amphioxus and tunicates. By using zebrafish as a reference, we compared the miRNA repertoires of
nematodes, fruit flies, tunicates, and amphioxus. miRNAs with a zebrafish homolog were recorded as +1; miRNAs not found in zebrafish were recorded as
-1.

age innovation, and this may advance our understanding of
the homology between the body plans of amphioxus and vertebrates.
In agreement with previous studies [3-6], we also observed an
acquisition of miRNA genes across the evolutionary step from
lower metazoans to higher vertebrates. Four major episodes
of miRNA innovation, correlated with significant body plan
changes among animals, have been identified since the
advent of Bilateria (Figure 4b; total miRNAs). The first wave
of miRNA innovation maps to the origin of bilaterian miRNAs. The second wave maps to the branch leading to the vertebrates. The third wave of miRNA expansion corresponds to
the advent of eutherian mammals. The fourth wave of miRNA
outburst coincides with the advent of primates. This observation strengthens the view that miRNAs have an important
role in shaping animal phenotypic diversity and complexity.
However, the expansion of the miRNA repertoire in the
cephalochordate lineage does not correspond to the outburst
of miRNA innovation. Approximately 20 miRNAs are shared
throughout the Bilateria, and all of these exist in amphioxus
(Figure 4b, miRNAs conserved throughout the Bilateria).
These miRNAs are phylogenetically conserved despite several
hundred million years of divergent evolution, suggesting
ancient roles for them in activating the terminal differentiation of organs, tissues and specific cell types common to
metazoans. Protostomes and chordates appear to have miRNAs that are specific to each clade as most invertebrate miRNAs have been lost in the chordate lineage (Figure 4b,
homologs of invertebrate miRNAs), and many novel miRNAs
present in both chordates and vertebrates have been fixed in
the chordate genome and perpetuated under intense purifying selection over evolutionary time (Figure 4b, miRNAs
present in both chordates and vertebrates). This observation
suggests that chordates have abandoned most ancestral characters and are more vertebrate-like than any other invertebrate. Since many vertebrate miRNAs have homologs in
amphioxus, these miRNAs must, therefore, have been
present in the last common ancestor of vertebrates. Thus, the
profound reorganization of the miRNA repertoires (the continuous expansion of the miRNA inventory and the loss of
ancient miRNAs) in amphioxus highlights the importance of
amphioxus as a model for understanding the transition from
invertebrates to vertebrates.

Comparison of the miRNA repertoires of
cephalochordates and tunicates
miRNA can also be employed as a valuable factor to resolve
outstanding evolutionary questions. For instance, a fundamental evolutionary question is whether cephalochordates or
tunicates are the closest living invertebrate relative of the vertebrates [23]. Living invertebrate chordates comprise the
urochordate tunicates (the most familiar of which are the
ascidians) and the cephalochordate amphioxus. Traditionally, cephalochordates are considered to be the closest living
relatives of vertebrates, with tunicates representing the earli-

est chordate lineage [7,8]. However, recent phylogenetic
analyses with large concatenated gene sets suggest that the
evolutionary positions of tunicates and cephalochordates
should be reversed [24]. In order to solve this puzzle, we
reconstructed the evolutionary histories of tunicates and
cephalochordates according to their miRNA histories.
If tunicates are more vertebrate-like, then they should possess a subset of miRNAs conserved across chordates and vertebrates, but few invertebrate-specific miRNAs. However, by
tracing the phylogenetic histories of miRNAs in Oikopleura
dioica,Ciona intestinalis, and B. belcheri (Gray), we found
that several phylogenetically conserved miRNAs were either
lost or no longer recognizable in Oikopleura dioica (for example, miR-33, miR-34, miR-125, miR-133, miR-184, and miR210), and we did not detect any miRNAs present in both chordates and vertebrates. Likewise, some phylogenetically conserved miRNAs were also lost in C. intestinalis (for example,
miR-1, miR-9 and miR-10). In contrast, many phylogenetically conserved miRNAs, as well as miRNAs present in both
chordates and vertebrates (for example, miR-216, miR-217,
miR-22, miR-25, and miR-96), could be reliably traced back
to B. belcheri (Gray). As can be seen in Figure 4c, amphioxus,
in comparison to tunicates, shares additional miRNAs with
zebrafish and abandons most ancestral miRNAs. These data
strongly suggest that amphioxus miRNAs are less divergent
from vertebrate miRNAs than are tunicate miRNAs. In agreement with this, the cephalochordate body plan is more vertebrate-like than that of any tunicate, as amphioxus possesses
many homologs of vertebrate organs (for example, the pineal
and pronephric kidneys) that are not found in tunicates [25].
Thus, the most appropriate organisms to use as a simple
model for deciphering the fundamentals of vertebrate development are turning out to be the amphioxus cephalochordates, whose body plans and miRNA repertoires are more
vertebrate-like than those of the tunicates. In contrast, tunicates are morphologically and molecularly derived with a
trend towards genomic simplification.

Discussion

One important question in evolutionary biology concerns the
origin of vertebrates from invertebrates. Amphioxus is generally accepted as an ideal model to use as a proxy for the ancestral vertebrates [7,8,26]. Recent advances in molecular
biology and microanatomy have supported homology of body
parts between vertebrates and amphioxus [8,27,28]. Thus, a
thorough knowledge of the morphology and genetic programs
of amphioxus may provide us with a unique opportunity to
reconstruct the major events of early vertebrate evolution and
decipher how the vertebrate body plan evolved.
While amphioxus is an outstanding model organism to bridge
the huge gap between invertebrates and vertebrates, no
amphioxus miRNAs have been registered in the miRNA database miRBase 12.0 [18]. The study of miRNAs in vertebrates

such as mice, rats and humans as well as invertebrates such
as C. elegans and Drosophila melanogaster has far outpaced
that in amphioxus. Given the important position of amphioxus in metazoan phylogeny, the identification of novel miRNAs from amphioxus will contribute greatly to our
understanding of both miRNA evolution and the possible role
of miRNAs in facilitating the evolution of more complex animal forms.
Previously, miRNAs were defined as non-coding RNAs that
fulfill a combination of expression and biogenesis criteria
[10,11]. First, a mature miRNA should be expressed as a distinct transcript of approximately 22 nucleotides that is detectable by Northern blot analysis or other experimental means
such as cloning from size-fractionated small RNA libraries.
Second, a mature miRNA should originate from a precursor
with a characteristic secondary structure, such as a hairpin or
fold-back, that does not contain large internal loops or bulges.
The mature miRNA should occupy the stem part of the hairpin. By this method, a large portion of the small RNAs, such
as breakdown products of mRNA transcripts, other endogenous non-coding RNAs (for example, tRNAs, rRNAs and
natural antisense small interfering RNAs), as well as exogenous small interfering RNAs, are filtered out from the population of miRNAs [10,11]. However, hairpin structures are
common in eukaryotic genomes and are not a unique feature
of miRNAs. Many random inverted repeats (termed pseudohairpins) can also fold into dysfunctional hairpins [14,17]. To
eliminate the false positive pseudo-hairpins, an optional but
commonly used criterion that requires miRNA sequence and
hairpin structure be conserved in different species [10,11] was
employed in the present study. By this definition, we detected
55 conserved miRNA genes in the amphioxus B. belcheri
(Gray) that encode 45 non-redundant mature miRNAs. All of
these conserved miRNAs meet the expression and structure
criteria required for miRNA annotation, and many have additional supporting evidence such as multiple observations of
expression, genomic clustering, and cloning of the star
sequences. Unfortunately, the problem has not been solved
thoroughly since a large number of non-conserved pre-miRNAs with species-specific expression patterns do exist in
eukaryotes [16]. To surmount the technical shortfalls of comparative methods for identifying species-specific and nonconserved pre-miRNAs, several ab initio predictive
approaches have been extensively developed [14,17]. With
these methods, many non-conserved miRNAs have been discovered and experimentally verified in viruses and human
[14,17]. Here, we used miPred, an ab initio prediction
approach for identifying pre-miRNAs without relying on phylogenetic conservation, to remove the irrelevant genomic pool
of pseudo-hairpins without sacrificing putative non-conserved pre-miRNAs [14,17]. Among 69 pre-miRNA-like hairpins, 11 were classified as pseudo-pre-miRNAs and 58 as
authentic pre-miRNAs. Thus, 58 miRNA genes constitute the
final collection of non-conserved miRNA genes in amphioxus,
and these encode 53 non-redundant mature miRNAs. Like-

wise, all of these miRNAs meet the expression and structural
criteria required for miRNA annotation, and many have additional supporting evidence, including multiple observations
of expression, genomic clustering and cloning of star
sequences. However, the set of non-conserved miRNAs was
fundamentally different from the set of conserved miRNAs,
as the non-conserved miRNAs were represented by only
23,613 tags compared to 246,524 tags for the conserved miRNAs. These results indicate that the non-conserved miRNAs
are expressed at substantially lower levels or in limited cell
types or circumstances.
While we were writing this manuscript, Luo and Zhang [29]
reported the computational prediction of 28 miRNAs in
amphioxus using a homology search of Branchiostoma floridae v1.0 (an incomplete amphioxus genome). However, prediction of miRNAs without experimental proof is not
sufficient, since predicted miRNAs only meet the structural
criterion for being authentic miRNAs [10]. Furthermore, the
computational approach provides no information on the
expression levels of amphioxus miRNAs. After carefully comparing our result with that of Luo and Zhang, we found that
the dataset from their study is just a subset of the Solexa dataset (Table S10 in Additional data file 1). In addition to computer-aided algorithms, Sanger-based molecular cloning
strategies have been frequently used to identify new miRNAs
in metazoans [30,31]. By using this method, Dai et al. [32]
provided experimental evidence for 33 evolutionarily conserved miRNAs and 35 amphioxus-specific miRNAs in the
amphioxus Branchiostoma japonicum. However, the Sangerbased molecular cloning approach is highly biased towards
abundantly and/or ubiquitously expressed miRNAs [17],
making it unsuitable for identifying miRNAs that are
expressed at low levels, at very specific stages or in rare cell
types. This limitation, however, can be overcome by massively parallel sequencing technologies that significantly
increase sequencing depth [11]. Accordingly, we employed
Solexa sequencing, a massively parallel sequencing technology, to identify miRNAs from amphioxus. Solexa is a breakthrough sequencing technology characterized by numerous
distinct advantages over conventional Sanger-based cloning
technologies. In addition to avoiding the bacterial cloning
steps inherent in Sanger sequencing, Solexa enables hundreds of thousands of short sequencing reads to be generated
in one run, thereby boosting the discovery of many expressed
small RNAs and resulting in the identification of more candidate miRNAs.
Consistent with this idea, our result is shown to be superior to
that of Dai et al.: First, the reads of amphioxus miRNAs identified by Dai et al. were fundamentally different from ours.
For instance, Dai et al. identified 841 sequences (out of 2,217
effective reads) as amphioxus miRNAs, whereas we identified
246,524 sequences (out of 313,313 effective reads) as amphioxus miRNAs. Second, after carefully comparing our dataset
with that from Dai et al.'s study, we found that all the con-

served miRNAs identified by Dai et al. are just a subset of the
conserved miRNAs identified by us, and 23 out of 35 amphioxus-specific miRNAs have been identified by both (Table
S10 in Additional data file 1). Third, besides expression and
structural criteria, Dai et al. provided no additional evidence
supporting the correct annotation of amphioxus-specific
miRNAs. As can be seen in Table S10 in Additional data file 1,
most of the 12 amphioxus-specific miRNAs identified from B.
japonicum but not found in B. belcheri (Gray) are classified as
pseudo-pre-miRNAs and represented by a single read. Thus,
these non-conserved miRNAs require more careful examination for correct annotation as genuine miRNAs. Fourth, we
showed that Solexa can produce highly accurate and definitive readouts of many low-level miRNAs, such as miRNA*s.
In contrast, none of miRNA*s has been found from B. japonicum by Sanger-based cloning approach. This result further
suggests that the Sanger-based molecular cloning approach is
unsuitable for identifying miRNAs that are expressed at low
levels.

cell lineage decisions during animal phylogeny. For instance,
miR-183, miR-184 and miR-96 dominate the population of
expressed miRNAs in sensory organs in vertebrates [33], and
these were also detected in amphioxus. Consistent with this,
amphioxus possesses a frontal eye (homologous to the vertebrate paired eyes) and a lamellar organ (homologous to vertebrate pineal photoreceptors) [28]. Likewise, in agreement
with the presence of gastric endocrine cells in amphioxus that
are possibly homologous to the pancreatic islet cells of mammals [34], miR-216, miR-217, miR-7, and miR-375, which are
characteristic of pancreatic tissue [35], are well established in
amphioxus. Although the detailed spatial expression of these
miRNAs remains to be shown, it is intriguing to speculate that
a pool of such miRNAs contributed greatly to the evolution of
complex vertebrate body plans. Further comparison of the
body part homology and miRNA repertoires of amphioxus
and vertebrates will allow us to model more precisely what
our ancestors were like and, thereby, provide a unique opportunity to decipher how the vertebrate body plan evolved.

When this manuscript was submitted, miRBase 13.0 was
released. Since our analysis was based on miRBase 12.0, we
updated the analysis by comparing our dataset with miRBase
13.0. No new miRNAs were identified and none of the major
conclusions changed, except that some amphioxus-specific
miRNAs were designated corresponding names (Table S10 in
Additional data file 1). Taken together, it turns out that Solexa
sequencing technology is the most powerful tool for miRNA
discovery. More importantly, comparison of miRNA identified from B. belcheri (Gray), B. floridae, and B. japonicum
will confirm the existence of some identical miRNAs in
amphioxus and provide important clues to the roles of some
special miRNAs.

Another interesting observation is that none of the miRNAs
involved in adaptive immunity (for example, miR-181a, miR155, and miR-223) could be reliably traced back to amphioxus
or previous protostomes [36]. When and how adaptive immunity emerged is an evolutionary mystery. It is generally
believed that adaptive immunity emerged suddenly and is
only present in jawed vertebrates [37]. We hypothesize that
certain key miRNAs, such as miR-181a, miR-155, and miR223, played a fundamental role in the genesis of the molecular
machinery of the adaptive immune system. In this regard, the
absence of these miRNAs in invertebrates (including amphioxus) explains why adaptive immunity is restricted to jawed
vertebrates. However, to understand better the evolutionary
origins of adaptive immune systems, more comparative data
from jawless vertebrates (for example, lamprey and hagfish)
are clearly needed.

We also present a comprehensive analysis of the organization
of amphioxus miRNA genes. Consistent with the miRNA
organization in zebrafish, mouse and humans, many amphioxus miRNAs have multiple copies in the genome and/or are
organized in clusters. The implications for miRNA gene
amplification are still unknown, but miRNA genes with multiple copies may augment or amplify the physiological functions of individual miRNA genes. Our observations support
the hypothesis that duplication events causing the rapid
spread of miRNA genes throughout the genome occur profoundly in the lineage leading to vertebrates.
Previous studies have suggested that animals with complex
organs have increased their cell type repertoire and morphological complexity over geological time in a manner strikingly
similar to the expansion of their miRNAs [4-6]. The availability of more miRNAs in animals with complex organs might be
helpful to further modulate the developmental network in
complex tissues and organs. Interestingly, we noted that
although amphioxus does not possess as many miRNAs as
vertebrates, it shares a set of key miRNAs with vertebrates
that may have had a huge impact on phenotypic diversity and

Conclusions

Our current study introduces an accurate and efficient
approach for miRNA discovery and will aid the identification
of many miRNAs in other species. More importantly, our
study provides the basis for future analysis of miRNA function in amphioxus. Further comparison of the body part
homology and miRNA repertoire between amphioxus and
vertebrates will allow us to model more precisely what our
ancestors were like and offer a unique opportunity to decipher how the vertebrate body plan evolved.

Materials and methods
Animal collection and RNA isolation
Adults of the Chinese amphioxus B. belcheri (Gray) were collected from Beihai, Guangxi, China and kept alive with seawater and sea alga. For Solexa sequencing, 12 adult animals were
pooled together, and total RNA was extracted from pooled

samples with Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Solexa sequencing
The sequencing procedure was conducted as previously
described [12]. Briefly, after PAGE purification of small RNA
molecules (under 30 bases) and ligation of a pair of Solexa
adaptors to their 5' and 3' ends, the small RNA molecules
were amplified using the adaptor primers for 17 cycles and
fragments of around 90 bp (small RNA + adaptors) were isolated from agarose gels. The purified DNA was used directly
for cluster generation and sequencing analysis using the Illumina Genome Analyzer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The image files
generated by the sequencer were then processed to produce
digital-quality data. After masking of adaptor sequences and
removal of contaminated reads, clean reads were processed
for computational analysis.

In silico analysis
Solexa reads were aligned against the amphioxus genome
(Branchiostoma floridae v2.0) [9] using SOAP [15].
Sequences with perfect match or one mismatch were retained
for further analysis. To further analyze the RNA secondary
structures comprising matched Solexa reads, 100 nucleotides
of genomic sequence flanking each side of these sequences
were extracted, and the secondary structures were predicted
using RNAfold [38] and analyzed by MIREAP [39] under
default settings. MIREAP is a computational tool specially
designed to identify genuine miRNAs from deeply sequenced
small RNA libraries; it fully considers miRNA biogenesis,
sequencing depth and structural features to improve the sensitivity and specificity of miRNA identification. Stem-loop
hairpins were considered typical only when they fulfilled
three criteria: mature miRNAs are present in one arm of the
hairpin precursors, which lack large internal loops or bulges;
the secondary structures of the hairpins are steady, with the
free energy of hybridization lower than -20 kcal/mol; and
hairpins are located in intergenic regions or introns. Those
genes whose sequences and structures satisfied all of these
criteria were considered as candidate miRNA genes. Subsequently, we adopted a computational approach named miRAlign to predict new miRNA genes that are paralogs or
orthologs to known miRNAs [13]. Finally, all remaining candidates were subjected to MiPred to filter out pseudo-premiRNAs. MiPred is a random forest-based method for classification of genuine pre-miRNAs and pseudo-pre-miRNAs
using a hybrid feature (including local contiguous structuresequence composition, minimum of free energy of the secondary structure and P-value of randomization test) [14].
Given a sequence, MiPred decides whether it is a pre-miRNAlike hairpin sequence or not. If the sequence is a pre-miRNAlike hairpin, the random forest-based classifier will predict
whether it is a genuine pre-miRNA (minimum of free energy
<-20 kcal/mol and P-value < 0.05) or a pseudo-pre-miRNA
(minimum of free energy >-20 kcal/mol or P-value > 0.05).

Stem-loop quantitative RT-PCR assay
Assays to quantify the mature miRNAs were conducted as
previously described [19,20]. Briefly, 1 μg of total RNA was
reverse-transcribed to cDNA by using AMV reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa Co., Tokyo, Japan) and looped antisense
primers. The mix was incubated at 16°C for 15 minutes, 42°C
for 60 minutes, and 85°C for 5 minutes. This allowed for the
creation of a library of multiple miRNA cDNAs. Real-time
PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems 7300
Sequence Detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA) by standardized protocol. In each assay, 1 μl cDNA
(1:50 dilution) was used for amplification. The reactions were
incubated in a 96-well optical plate at 95°C for 5 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 1 minute. All
reactions were run in triplicate. After reaction, the threshold
cycle (CT) was determined using default threshold settings.
The CT is defined as the fractional cycle number at which the
fluorescence passes the fixed threshold. To calculate the
expression levels of miRNAs, a series of synthetic miRNA oligonucleotides with known concentration were also reversetranscribed and amplified. The absolute amount of each
miRNA was then calculated by referring to the standard
curve.

Microarray experiments
The 795 complementary probes (in triplicate) against miRNAs, corresponding to 537 human, 204 mouse, and 54 rat
miRNAs, were designed based on miRBase release 12.0 [18].
RNA labeling, microarray hybridization and array scanning
were performed as previously described [21]. Briefly, 25 μg of
total RNA was used to isolate the low molecular weight RNA
using polyethylene glycol solution precipitation. Subsequently, low molecular weight RNAs were labeled with Cy3
and hybridized with miRNA microarrays (CapitalBio Corp.,
Beijing, China). Finally, hybridization signals were detected
and quantified. Four independent adult amphioxus RNA
samples were hybridized with miRNA microarrays separately. Hybridization intensity values from individual amphioxus sample were filtered and global median normalized. We
considered candidate miRNAs with a signal above 3,000 and
P < 0.001 from a Student's test (compared with the blank
spotting solution) to be positive.

Pearson's correlation coefficient
Correlation is a technique for investigating the relationship
between two quantitative, continuous variables. Pearson's
correlation coefficient R, also known as the product-moment
coefficient of correlation, is a measure of the strength of the
association between the two variables. The first step in studying the relationship between two continuous variables is to
draw a scatter plot of the variables to check for linearity. The
nearer the scatter of points is to a straight line, the higher the
strength of association between the variables. The Pearson's
correlation coefficient R may take any value from -1 to +1.
