Abstract
Influenza B viruses cause a significant amount of morbidity and mortality. The occurrence of
homologous recombination in influenza viruses is controversial. To determine the extent of
homologous recombination in influenza B viruses, recombination analyses of 2,650 sequences
representing all eight segments of the influenza B viruses were carried out. Only four sequences
were indentified as putative recombinants, which were verified using phylogenetic methods.
However, the mosaics detected here were much likely to represent cases of laboratory-generated
artificial recombinants. As in other myxoviruses, it is unlikely that homologous recombination plays
a major role in influenza B virus evolution.

Background
Influenza B viruses cause substantial morbidity and mortality in humans. As a member of the Orthomyxoviridae
family, influenza B virus possesses a single-stranded and
segmented genome of negative sense. Unlike influenza A
viruses, no antigenic shift has ever been detected in influenza B viruses. No subtype divisions of surface antigens
exist and two lineages, Victoria lineage and Yamagata lineage, have diverged since 1983 as defined by the phylogenetic relationship of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene [1]. All
11 genes of influenza B viruses have diverged into two
new lineages prior to 1987 [2,3]. Reassortment occurs frequently among influenza B viruses and likely allows unrestricted lineage mixing [2].

Gibbs et al. proposed that homologous recombination
had occurred in the HA gene of 1918 Spanish flu virus [7].
However, the apparent recombination event described by
Gibbs et al. is much likely to result from a difference in the
substitution rate of evolution between HA1 and HA2 [8].
More recently, Boni et al. demonstrate that homologous
recombination is very rare or absent in human influenza
A viruses through analyzing a data set of 13,852 sequences
representing all eight RNA segments and of both major
circulating subtypes, H3N2 and H1N1 [9]. Therefore,
whether homologous RNA recombination occurs in influenza viruses is one of the key research questions in influenza virus evolution [10].

Results and Discussion
To date, there is also ample evidence that various forms of
non-homologous recombination, albeit rarely, occurs in
influenza viruses [4-6]. However, the occurrence of
homologous recombination in influenza viruses is controversial and far from proven. For influenza A viruses,

To access whether homologous RNA recombination plays
a role in the evolution of influenza B viruses, we compiled
a data set of 2,650 sequences (PB2, 224; PB1, 230; PA,
230; HA, 330; NP, 236; NA, 687; MP, 332; NS, 381) representing all eight RNA segments. The sequences were

obtained from the Influenza Virus Resource [11] and then
aligned using Clustal X [12]. To gain an initial insight into
possible recombination events, each of the eight data sets
was analyzed respectively using the 3SEQ [13], the Chimaera [14], and the RDP [15] methods, which are available in RDP (Recombination detection program) software.
Interestingly, all these three methods implemented got
the same results. Only four potential recombinants were
primarily identified (Table 1). The recombinants were distributed over only three (PB2, NA, and HA) of the eight
influenza B virus RNA segments.
Recombination events were further confirmed and the
exact breakpoints were identified using GARD (Genetic
Algorithm Recombination Detection) online [16,17]. To
better evaluate the evidence for these recombination
events, the breakpoints identified by GARD were used to
divide the alignment into two parts to construct phylogenetic trees respectively. Phylogenetic trees were generated
using the Maximum Composite Likelihood (MCL)
method for estimating evolutionary distances and neighbor-joining (NJ) method [18] in MEGA4.0 [19]. The phylogenetic trees were tested with bootstrap of 1000
replicates. The occurrence of incongruent phylogenetic
trees, the most compelling evolutionary evidence for
recombination, was observed for all the four putative
recombinants which further confirmed the results of the
recombination analyses above. Meanwhile, topological
shifts for each of the recombinants have strong bootstrap
support (data not shown).
However, large influenza viral genes in the databases may
actually represent assembled artifactual contigs from different but homologous gene segments present in a mixed
sample to begin with. Such artifactual contigs are also
likely to be produced in a mixed sample by template
switching during PCR amplification [20] even if only a
single primer set is used. Mixture of viruses was present
leading to the illusion of a recombination event as a consequence of the sequencing methodology being
employed. A plausible explanation for the "recombinants" detected here is contamination by influenza

virus derived PCR products, which could combine during
PCR amplification to generate apparent, but artifactual
recombinants. None of the three putative recombinant
viruses were derived by plaque purification. Furthermore,
the same laboratory was the source for all four recombinants and the one putative parental strain. As suggested
in influenza A virus [9], further work would be needed to
conclusively demonstrate homologous recombination in
influenza B viruses. Recombinant influenza virus must
either be plaque purified or multiple clones must be isolated and sequenced from the same individual or animal
host. The presence of both the recombinant and parental
genotypes should be found in the sample [21]. Alternatively, homologous recombination could be demonstrated by showing that recombinant sequences form a
distinct lineage circulated among multiple identified individuals [22].

Conclusion
To sum up, our analysis showed that homologous recombination in influenza B viruses was very rare or absent and
could not confer a substantial fitness advantage. Therefore, we conclude that homologous recombination is
unlikely to play a major role in influenza B virus evolution.
