Abstract
Background: AlkB-like proteins are members of the 2-oxoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent
oxygenase superfamily. In Escherichia coli the protein protects RNA and DNA against damage from
methylating agents. 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine are repaired by oxidative demethylation
and direct reversal of the methylated base back to its unmethylated form. Genes for AlkB
homologues are widespread in nature, and Eukaryotes often have several genes coding for AlkBlike proteins. Similar domains have also been observed in certain plant viruses. The function of the
viral domain is unknown, but it has been suggested that it may be involved in protecting the virus
against the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) system found in plants. We wanted to do a
phylogenomic mapping of viral AlkB-like domains as a basis for analysing functional aspects of these
domains, because this could have some relevance for understanding possible alternative roles of
AlkB homologues e.g. in Eukaryotes.
Results: Profile-based searches of protein sequence libraries showed that AlkB-like domains are
found in at least 22 different single-stranded RNA positive-strand plant viruses, but mainly in a
subgroup of the Flexiviridae family. Sequence analysis indicated that the AlkB domains probably are
functionally conserved, and that they most likely have been integrated relatively recently into
several viral genomes at geographically distinct locations. This pattern seems to be more consistent
with increased environmental pressure, e.g. from methylating pesticides, than with interaction with
the PTGS system.
Conclusions: The AlkB domain found in viral genomes is most likely a conventional DNA/RNA
repair domain that protects the viral RNA genome against methylating compounds from the
environment.

Background
The purpose of this study has been to identify domains
with homology to AlkB in viral genomes, in order to get a
better understanding of distribution and possible function of such domains. The AlkB protein of E. coli, and
probably most of its homologues, is involved in repair of
alkylation damage in DNA and RNA. It repairs 1-methyl-

adenine and 3-methylcytosine by oxidative demethylation and direct reversal of the methylated base back to its
unmethylated form. Recently the protein was identified as
a member of the 2-oxoglutarate (2OG)- and Fe(II)dependent oxygenase superfamily [1-3]. The catalytic
reaction requires molecular oxygen, Fe2+ and 2-oxoglutar-

ate, which is subsequently converted into succinate, CO2
and formaldehyde [4].
The 2OG-FeII oxygenase superfamily is widespread in
Eukaryotes and bacteria [1], and is currently the largest
known family of oxidising enzymes without a heme
group [5]. The 3D structure of several of these oxygenases
is known, and they share a common fold with a structurally conserved jelly roll β-sheet core with flanking α-helices. Very few residues are totally conserved across these
structures, basically just the residues involved in coordination of the Fe(II) ion and the 2-oxoglutarate.
AlkB-like genes are widespread in most types of organisms
except Archaea. However, whereas bacteria normally have
just one or at most two AlkB homologues [6], multicellular Eukaryotes tend to have several homologues. In the
human genome at least 8 different AlkB homologues
(ABHs) have been identified [7]. These homologues seem
to have slightly different properties with respect to substrate preference and subcellular localisation, and this
may be a reason for the proliferation of ABHs e.g. in
humans. However, a detailed functional mapping of all
ABHs has not yet been carried out.
A sequence alignment of known ABHs identifies very few
residues as totally conserved, basically just a HxD motif, a
H and a RxxxxxR motif. These residues are also conserved
in the more general 2OG-FeII oxygenase superfamily as
described above, except for the final R. The first three residues (HxD and H) are involved in Fe(II)-coordination,
whereas the first R is involved in 2OG-coordination. The
final R is most likely involved in AlkB-specific substrate
binding.
In addition to DNA repair, it has been shown that E. coli
AlkB and the human AlkB homologue hABH3 may be
involved in RNA repair. When expressed in E. coli both
AlkB and hABH3 reactivate methylated RNA bacteriophage MS2 in vivo. This illustrates that direct repair may
be an important mechanism for maintenance of RNA in
living cells [4]. RNA repair proceeds by the same mechanism as DNA repair. Repair of damaged RNA was previously considered very unlikely, due to the natural
redundancy of RNAs in a cell [8]. However, RNA is essential for cell function: unrepaired RNA can lead to miscoded or truncated proteins, and alkylated RNA could
signal cell cycle checkpointing or apoptosis [9]. Consequently the occurrence of RNA repair does not come as a
great surprise. The mechanism of direct reversal of methylation as used by AlkB homologues is particularly important for RNA repair, as it means that single-stranded
regions may be repaired without introducing strand
breaks. Repair of alkylation damage in DNA and RNA has
recently been reviewed [10].

PSI-Blast search results shown as a Venn diagram. Initial
searches using methyltransferase, helicase and RdRp domains
retrieved 163, 175 and 237 sequences, respectively. A total
of 146 sequences contained all three domains, and 22 of
these also contained an AlkB domain.

AlkB homologues have also been found in plant viruses.
It has been suggested that methylation may be used in
host-mediated inactivation of viral RNAs, and that AlkB
homologues in some plant viruses may be used to counteract such defence mechanisms [1]. However, no detailed
study of this has been published.
The research project reported here has focused on a better
understanding of the distribution and potential function
of putative AlkB homology domains by using in silico
mapping of viruses in which such domains have been
found, as well as related viruses.

Results
The general mapping strategy of the project was to identify
viral genomes with AlkB homology domains, identify
common features of these genomes, and subsequently
find additional genomes with similar features, but without AlkB homology domains. This data set could then be
used to analyse the properties and distribution of AlkBlike domains in viruses, as a basis for generating hypotheses about the evolution and function of these domains.
Identification of relevant viral protein sequences
The PSI-Blast search for viruses in the NCBI nr protein
sequence database was initiated with ALKB_ECOLI (NCBI
gi113638), restricted to residues 110 to 210 and using the
default inclusion threshold of 0.005 on E-values. The

The PSI-Blast search converged after 4 iterations, and
included 43 hits below the 0.005 inclusion threshold,
from 22 different ssRNA positive-strand viruses. The AlkB

homologues were found in viruses belonging to Allexi,
Ampelo, Carla, Fovea, Mandari, Potex, Tricho and Vitiviruses,
all of which are known to infect plants [11].
In all of these viruses the AlkB domain is a part of the replicase polyprotein, which normally consists of a viral

methyltransferase domain (MT), a viral helicase domain
(HEL) and a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain
(RdRp). Therefore separate PSI-Blast searches for the individual components of the replicase polyprotein were also
initiated. All searches were done with PSI-Blast using the
default inclusion threshold (E-value of 0.005). The
searches for MT and HEL domains were initiated using
residue ranges 449–841 and 1938–2178 respectively from
Grapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (Ampelovirus, NCBI
gi29650261). The search for RdRp was initiated with residue range 1361–1798 from Soil-borne cereal mosaic virus
(Furovirus, NCBI gi11546056). These sequences were chosen based on the output from the previous AlkB search.
This gave a library of protein sequences with either AlkB,
MT, HEL or RdRp domains, the general composition of
which is illustrated in Figure 1. From this library a subset
was generated, consisting of all sequences containing MT,
HEL and RdRp domains. This included processed
(cleaved) polyprotein sequences where RdRp was found
as a separate subsequence. However, whenever possible,
the protein sequence corresponding to the genomic
sequence was used. The final library, described in Table 1
and in Additional file 1, consisted of 146 sequences from
a large number of different viruses.
The library of protein sequences was screened for known
domains in Pfam. This identified Pfam domains
Viral_helicase1 and RNA_dep_RNApol2 in all sequences,
corresponding to HEL and RdRp domains, respectively. In
addition Vmethyltransf and 2OG-FeII_Oxy, corresponding
to MT and 2OG-FeII oxygenase (AlkB) domains, were
identified in several sequences. However, for sequences
from Flexiviridae and Tymoviridae there was no clear identification of any MT domain by Pfam, although they had
been retrieved by PSI-Blast in a search for MT domains.
Therefore HMMER was used to build a Pfam type profile
for these sequences. A PSI-Blast search was initiated using
residues 1–500 of Potato virus M (Carlavirus, NCBI
gi9626090). Twelve representative sequences were
selected from the search output, covering Carla, Fovea,
Potex, Allexi, Capillo and Maculavirus. Subsequences
representing the conserved region according to the PSIBlast alignment, corresponding to residues 35–378 of the
query sequence, were aligned using ClustalX, and a Pfam
type profile was generated and calibrated using tools from
the HMMER package. The resulting profile was able to
identify putative methyltransferase domains in all Flexiviridae and Tymoviridae sequences in the data set.
Other Pfam domains – Peptidase_C21, C23, C33, C34, C35
and C41, A1pp and OTU – were also identified in subsets
of sequences. A1pp is a member of the Appr-1-p processing enzyme family, and the domain is found in a number
of otherwise unrelated proteins, including non-structural
proteins of several types of ssRNA viruses. OTU is a mem-

ber of a family of cysteine proteases that are homologous
to the ovarian tumour (otu) gene in Drosophila. Members
of this family are found in Eukaryotes, viruses and pathogenic bacteria.
Phylogenetic analysis
The MT, HEL and RdRp domains identified by Pfam as
described above were extracted from the library
sequences, aligned by ClustalX, and combined into a new
alignment consisting of only these domain regions. This
turned out to be necessary in order to get robust alignments. The intervening regions between the conserved
domains are extremely variable in these sequences, and
this tended to confuse alignment programs in the sense
that conserved regions were not correctly aligned. The
combined sequence alignment of domains from Closteroviridae, Flexiviridae and Tymoviridae was then used as input
for building a phylogenetic tree with MEGA2. The final
tree is shown in Figure 2, with polyproteins containing
AlkB-like domains indicated.

A second alignment was generated from all sequences
with AlkB-like domains, using only the regions corresponding to MT, AlkB, HEL and RdRp Pfam domains. The
domains were aligned individually, and the combined
alignment was used as input for MEGA2. However, this
data set did not give a reliable phylogeny (data not
shown), and the separate domains of this alignment were
therefore analysed individually and compared. This analysis is summarised in Table 2. For each domain a bootstrapped neighbour-joining (NJ) tree was generated with
MEGA2. The average bootstrap support value over all
branches was computed for each tree, and this value was
clearly lower for the AlkB tree compared to the other trees.
A maximum likelihood (ML) tree was generated for each
domain with Tree-Puzzle. This showed the same trend,
the likelihood values indicated that the AlkB tree was
clearly inferior to the other trees. The individual trees were
then compared using the quartet-based strict joint assertions (SJA) measure as implemented in the Component
software package. Both the NJ and ML trees showed the
same trend. The MT, HEL and RdRp domains gave similar
tree structures, with SJA values between 0.053 and 0.161
for NJ trees and between 0.058 and 0.092 for ML trees
when they were compared to each other. The AlkB
domain gave a significantly different tree structure, with
SJA values from 0.456 to 0.524 for NJ trees and from
0.258 to 0.317 for ML trees when compared to the MT,
HEL and RdRp trees (the actual trees are given in Additional file 2). For comparison the SJA values for comparing the corresponding NJ and ML trees for MT, AlkB, HEL
and RdRp were 0.054, 0.000, 0.040 and 0.003, respectively, showing that the NJ and ML procedures gave
almost identical tree structures. Day has estimated expectation values and standard deviations for various distance

measures (including SJA) for comparison of random trees
[12]. The SJA values shown in Table 2 for comparisons
between MT, HEL and RdRp NJ trees were 14.2 – 17.1
standard deviations from the expectation value of 0.665
for a tree with 22 nodes, whereas the corresponding values for the AlkB NJ tree were 4.4 – 5.4 standard deviations
from the expectation value. Similar ranges were observed
for the ML trees as well as for alternative distance measures, e.g. the Symmetric Difference (SD) measure (data
not shown). Although this means that the SJA value for
comparing AlkB trees to MT, HEL and RdRp trees were significantly better than for random trees, it also shows that
the MT, HEL and RdRp trees were clearly more similar to
each other than to the AlkB tree.
The alignment of the AlkB domain seemed to be of comparable quality to the other alignments. In fact the AlkB
domain had the highest average pairwise sequence identity, as seen in Table 2 (see Figure 3 for the actual alignment). In other words, these AlkB domains were as similar
to each other as the other three domains with respect to
sequence identity, but they did not represent a consistent
evolutionary history when compared to the other
domains of this polyprotein. This may indicate that the
AlkB domains have evolved separately from the other
domains, and possibly as several independent instances.
The degree of co-evolution was analysed by computing
pairwise distances between sequence regions in the alignment of MT, AlkB, HEL and RdRp domains described
above. In Figure 4 selected results are shown as scatter
plots, where the Blosum 50 score value between e.g. the
MT domains in a pair of sequences is plotted against the
score value for AlkB domains in the same pair of
sequences. Plots for the MT, HEL and RdRp domains
show that they are strongly correlated for MT vs. RdRp (r2
= 0.95), MT vs. HEL (r2 = 0.87) and HEL vs. RdRp (r2 =
0.81). The plot of the AlkB domain vs. these three
domains for the same set of sequences shows a very low

degree of correlation for AlkB vs. RdRp (r2 = 0.10), AlkB vs.
MT (r2 = 0.12) and AlkB vs. HEL (r2 = 0.16).
As mentioned above the genome organisation of these
replicase polyprotein sequences seems to be very flexible.
In order to analyse domain organisation the location of
identified Pfam domains were plotted for a number of
sequences, as shown in Figure 5.
Similarity of viral AlkB domains to other AlkB sequences
The results described above may indicate that the AlkB
domains have been integrated into the replicase polyprotein relatively recently (see Discussion). In order to test for
potential sources selected AlkB domains were compared
to non-viral sequences. PSI-Blast was used to search the
NCBI nr database, removing all viral hits in the final
search report. Most of the remaining top-scoring hits were
from bacteria. This included two different strains of Xanthomonas, X. axonopodis pv citri and X. campestris pv campestris. Xanthomonas attacks plants such as citrus, beans,
grapevine, rice and cotton [13]. The search also returned
high-scoring hits from another plant pathogen, Xylella fastidiosa. This bacterium infects a great variety of plants,
including grapevine, citrus, periwinkle, almond, oleander
and coffee [14].
Potential similarities in variable regions
Pfam searches obviously will only identify known domain
types in protein sequences. In order to identify potential
similarities in regions that were not recognised by Pfam,
systematic PSI-Blast searches were performed, using the
polyprotein regions between the MT and HEL domains
and searching against the NCBI database of reference
sequences [15], excluding all viral entries. A maximum of
5 PSI-Blast iterations were allowed, with an inclusion
threshold of 0.005. The expected homologues of the AlkBdomain were found with high confidence, as most of the
E-values were < 1 × 10-50. Homologues of typical viral
domains like the viral peptidases were obviously not
found, as all viral database entries were excluded. Very few

Multiple alignment of sequence regions corresponding to the AlkB domains
Multiple alignment of sequence regions corresponding to the AlkB domains. The alignment was generated with ClustalX. The
residues involved in coordination of the essential Fe2+ ion are completely conserved, except in one of the Vitivirus sequences.
These residues are the HxD motif, a single H, and the first R in the RxxxxxR motif. The function of the remaining conserved
residues is unclear, but at least some of them may be involved in coordination of the substrate [10].

Pairwise4distances between sequence regions corresponding to methyltransferase (MT), RdRp and AlkB domains
Pairwise distances between sequence regions corresponding to methyltransferase (MT), RdRp and AlkB domains. Each data
point corresponds to e.g. RP-RP and MT-MT distances for the same pair of sequences, and sequences showing similar evolutionary distance in these two regions will fall on the diagonal. The pairwise distances were estimated from multiple alignments
using the Blosum50 score matrix [47]. Trend lines were estimated with Excel. The trend line for AlkB vs. RdRp is heavily influenced by the point at (675, 670). It represents two Foveavirus sequences (NCBI gi3702789 and gi9630738), they are 98% identical over the full polyprotein sequence.

new similarities were found by these searches. Pepper ringspot virus (Tobravirus, NCBI gi20178599) showed significant similarity to site-specific DNA-methyltransferase
from Nostoc sp (E = 1 × 10-74), as well as other cytosine 5Cspecific DNA methylases. Bamboo mosaic virus (Potexvirus,
NCBI gi9627984) showed similarity to aggregation substance Asa1 from Enterococcus faecalis (E = 6 × 10-34). A
small number of additional similarities seemed to be
caused by biased sequence properties (e.g. proline-rich
regions), and were probably not significant. This included
matches against mucin and cadherin-like proteins from
Homo sapiens and multidomain presynaptic cytomatrix
protein (piccolo) from Rattus norvegicus. In general the
variable regions seemed to be truly variable, with very little similarity to other proteins, except for the Pfam
domains already identified.
Loss of domains in related polyprotein sequences
As seen in Figures 2 and 5, some closely related sequences
are lacking specific domains in the sense that HMMER
does not find a significant similarity to the Pfam entries
for these domains. In order to understand the degree of

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/1

sequence variation associated with this domain loss, as
well as the general sequence variation in conserved vs.
non-conserved regions of typical polyproteins, several dot
plots were generated. The dot plot for two Carlavirus
sequences, Potato virus M (NCBI gi9626090) and Aconitum
latent virus (NCBI gi14251191), is shown in Figure 6. The
dot plot confirms that these two sequences are closely
related in the MT, HEL and RdRp domains. However,
there are significant differences in the region between MT
and HEL. Potato virus M is lacking the AlkB domain
whereas Aconitum latent virus is lacking the OTU domain.
As seen from the dot plot, short regions of similarity close
to the diagonal shows that both domains may have been
present in an ancestral sequence. However, this region
shows a high degree of sequence variation, and as indicated by the dot plot they are almost exclusively mutations. Non-essential or non-functional domains are
probably rapidly lost. In this particular case, none of the
typical AlkB motifs seem to be conserved in Potato virus M,
indicating that this indeed is a non-functional AlkB
domain.

Discussion
The N-terminal domains of Flexiviridae and Tymoviridae
are methyltransferases
As described above the Pfam methyltransferase motif
(Vmethyltransf) did not match any of the putative methyltransferase domains of Flexiviridae and Tymoviridae,
despite the fact that they had been identified via PSI-Blast
searches starting with known methyltransferases.
Therefore an additional Pfam-type profile was generated.
It is obviously a possibility that these domains in Flexiviridae and Tymoviridae are not methyltransferases, and that
they are false positives from PSI-Blast. However, the essential residues of a typical viral methyltransferase motif are
conserved in the alignment of these domains (data not
shown) [16]. In Bamboo mosaic virus, which belongs to
Flexiviridae, the residues H68, D122, R125 and Y213 have
been identified as putative active site residues with similarity to the Sindbis virus-like methyltransferase [17], and
it has been demonstrated that this region of the Bamboo
mosaic virus has methyltransferase activity, as it catalyses
the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) to GTP or guanylylimidodiphosphate
(GIDP). The corresponding sequence positions are almost
completely conserved in the alignment of Flexiviridae and
Tymoviridae N-terminal domains. This is most likely significant, as only 7 positions in total are completely conserved in this alignment, which means that the majority of
the conserved positions are known to be essential for
methyltransferase activity. Work e.g. by Hataya et al.
seems to support the assumption that this sequence
region is a methyltransferase domain [18]. It therefore
seems likely that all the sequences with AlkB domains also
contain functional MT, HEL and RdRp domains. The MT

domains are probably involved in capping of genomic
and subgenomic RNA [19].
The viral AlkB domains are most likely functional
Based on the bioinformatic evidence generated here, it
seems reasonable to assume that the viral AlkB domains
identified by Pfam are functional. All the essential residues found in 2-oxoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenases are conserved, in particular the putative Fe2+
coordinating H, D and H residues at alignment positions
19, 21 and 91 of Figure 3, and the 2-oxoglutarate coordinating R at position 100. The conserved R at position 106
is also very characteristic of AlkB homologues [10]. The
fact that all AlkB-like domains identified in these viral
genomes are full-length, compared to the Pfam profile,
also seems to support the hypothesis that these domains
are functional.

and Carlavirus. This subset is well separated from the
remaining Flexiviridae in the phylogenetic analysis. The
split seems to be robust from bootstrap analysis, therefore
this family will be discussed here as two subfamilies, Flexiviridae 1 and 2. The same split was observed by Adams et
al. in their recent analysis of the Flexiviridae family [20].
Most of the AlkB domains (15) are found in Flexiviridae 2.
The remaining AlkB domains are found in Flexiviridae 1
(5) and Closteroviridae (2). In general, all the Flexiviridae 2
sequences have at least one extra domain in addition to
MT, HEL and RdRp: either AlkB, OTU-like cysteine protease or a peptidase. Most other plant viruses that are
included in this survey do not have additional domains,
except for Tymoviridae where a peptidase domain seems to
be common. For the remaining plant virus families
included here (excluding Tymoviridae and Flexiviridae 2),
only 14% seem to have additional domains.

The AlkB domains are found in a subset of viral genomes
The Pfam searches show that AlkB domains are found
only in a subset of the viral genomes. This subset is phylogenetically consistent (see Figure 2), as it is mainly
restricted to the Flexiviridae, and in particular to a subset
of the Flexiviridae consisting of Viti, Capillo, Tricho, Fovea

Introduction of AlkB domain in plant virus is probably a
recent event
The observed distribution of AlkB domains could most
easily be explained by assuming that an ancestral AlkB
domain was integrated into the genome of the last common ancestor of the Flexiviridae 2 subfamily. Subsequent

virus generations derived from this common ancestor
would then also contain an AlkB domain, except in those
cases where the domain was lost again. This scenario
could also include subsequent transfer to a small number
of other virus families e.g. by recombination.
If this scenario was correct, then one would expect the different domains of the polyprotein to have a similar evolutionary history. From the phylogenetic analysis (Table 2)
this seems to be confirmed for the MT, HEL and RdRp
domains, but not for the AlkB domain. This indicates that
the AlkB domain may not have co-evolved with the other
domains, at least until relatively recently. This seems to be
confirmed by looking at the degree of co-evolution, which
was analysed by computing pairwise distances between
alignment regions representing the relevant domains
(Figure 4). In the case of perfect co-evolution all points
should fall on a diagonal. This seems to be the case for the
MT, HEL and RdRp domains. However, the plot of the
AlkB domain vs. these three domains for the same set of
sequences does not show a similar correlation. Only some
of the closely related sequence pairs in the upper right
quadrant of the plot in Figure 4 show some degree of correlation for AlkB vs. RdRp. The most likely explanation
seems to be that most of the AlkB domains have not coevolved with the other domains for any significant period
of time. This seems to rule out the possibility of ancient
integration of the AlkB domain, except if we assume that
an ancient viral AlkB domain has frequently recombined
with other AlkB domains. However, it is difficult to distinguish a scenario with frequent recombination of AlkB
domains from de novo integration, and the net effect on
the properties observed here would be the same.
As seen in Figure 4, the range of score values is generally
smaller for the AlkB domains than e.g. the RdRp domains,
particularly if we exclude a couple of very high-scoring
cases (see figure caption). On the other hand, the degree
of sequence variation within the collection of AlkB
domains is significant, average sequence identity for pairwise alignments is 38%, and only 10% of the positions are
totally conserved. This can be consistent with a recent
integration if we assume that several different AlkB-type
vectors have been used for integration (see below for
details). An increased mutation rate after integration
could also have contributed to sequence diversity in this
region. Moving the AlkB domain into a novel structural
and functional context would have removed many of the
original evolutionarily constraints, as well as introduced
some new ones. This could have created a "punctuated
equilibrium" type of situation, potentially leading to a
very rapid evolution that could have introduced significant differences between the AlkB domains, independent
of the evolution in the other domains. A high mutation
rate seems to be the case for this region in general, as indi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/1

cated in Figure 6. Although the MT, HEL and RdRp
domains seem to be well conserved from the dot plot,
there are very large sequence variations in the intervening
region. One sequence in Figure 6 has a well conserved
AlkB domain, the other an OTU domain. The fact that
there are very weak sequence similarities in these two
domains in the dot plot indicates that both sequences
originally had both domains. However, the fact that this
similarity now is very weak and without any of the typical
AlkB active site motifs also indicates a high mutation rate
where non-essential domains are rapidly lost. Therefore
the conservation of AlkB domains is a strong indication
that they are functional, as already mentioned.
The AlkB domains may represent several separate
integrations
If we assume that AlkB domains have been integrated relatively recently, then either de novo integration or recombination (horizontal gene transfer) may have been the
main driving force for spreading the AlkB domain to new
genomes. In the first case a large number of individual
integrations could have lead to the present situation. If
horizontal gene transfer was the main driving force, the
initial number of integrations might have been quite
small. It is not easy to differentiate between these two
situations.

The map of Pfam motifs in the variable region between
the MT and HEL domains in Flexiviridae 2 polyproteins
(Figure 5) shows that they have a very similar domain
organisation, basically an AlkB domain followed by an
OTU domain and a peptidase domain, located towards
the C-terminal part of the sub-sequence. The relatively
constant domain organisation seems to be consistent with
a small number of initial integrations that were subsequently diffused to related genomes e.g. by homologous
recombination. However, this is not fully consistent with
the fact that the viruses with AlkB domains have been
collected from hosts at very different locations, e.g. Canada, USA, Russia, Italy, Germany, France, India, Taiwan,
China and Japan. Although import of virus-infected species or transmission by insects may transport viruses over
significant distances, it is not obvious that this is enough
to explain the observed distribution of AlkB-like domains.
Therefore several independent integrations, mainly from
closely related hosts, have to be considered as an alternative explanation. This explanation seems to be supported
by the apparent lack of any consistent evolutionary relationships between the various AlkB domains, as seen in
Table 2. It is not easy to see how this model can be consistent with the observed similarities in domain organisation in Flexiviridae. Assuming that this region has a high
degree of variability, one would expect the variability to
affect localisation of integrated domains as well. However, it is possible that conserved regions e.g. in the

Page 11 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:1

polyprotein play a significant role in integration of novel
domains. It may be relevant in this context that
preliminary simulations indicate that e.g. the AlkB
domains tend to form independent folding domains in
the folded RNA structure of the polyprotein RNA (F. Drabløs, unpublished data). This property may possibly facilitate the insertion of such domains into the viral genome.
The original AlkB integration may be of bacterial origin
There are many groups of organisms that can act as vectors
and spread viruses, including bacteria, fungi, nematodes,
arthropods and arachnids. The plant viruses may have
acquired the AlkB domain either from the vector or from
the host itself. As already mentioned, searching with viral
AlkB domains in protein sequence databases resulted
mainly in bacterial sequences, including the plant pathogens X. fastidiosa and campestris. It is therefore a reasonable
possibility that AlkB domains in plant viruses have originated from bacterial mRNA. It is also possible that the
mRNA originated from other vectors or from the host
itself, but at the present time this is not easily verified or
disproved because of the limited number of insect and
plant genomes that have been sequenced.
The AlkB domain probably protects virus RNA against
methylation
It has previously been suggested that the viral AlkB
domain may be involved in protecting the virus against
the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) system of
the host [1]. PTGS is known as one of a plant's intrinsic
defence mechanisms against viruses [21]. Gene silencing
can occur either through repression of transcription (transcriptional gene silencing – TGS) or through mRNA degradation, PTGS. The PTGS-mechanism in plants shows
similarities to RNA interference (RNAi) in animals [22].
This mechanism results in the specific degradation of
RNA. Degradation can be activated by introduction of
transgenes, RNA viruses or DNA sequences homologous
to expressed genes [23]. Many viruses have developed
mechanisms to counteract PTGS in order to successfully
infect plants [24]. Two of these suppressors of PTGS have
been identified as Hc-Protease and the 2b protein of
Cucumber mosaic virus [25]. Although both proteins suppress PTGS, it is likely that they do so via different mechanisms. Could the AlkB-like domain found in some of the
plant viruses also be a suppressor of PTGS? Previously
reported research indicates that methylation of transcribed sequences is somehow connected with PTGS, and
the methylation can be mediated by a direct RNA-DNA
interaction [26]. This RNA-directed DNA methylation has
been described in plants, and leads to de novo methylation
of nearly all cytosine residues within the region of
sequence identity between RNA and DNA [27]. Both RNA
methylation and methylation of host proteins that are
essential for viral replication would be detrimental to the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/1

virus. It has already been mentioned that AlkB repairs 1methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine by oxidative
demethylation. It is therefore possible that AlkB demethylates the nucleotides methylated by the PTGS mechanism, helping the virus to overcome one of the major
defence mechanisms of the plant.
As shown here, only a subset of plant viruses have the
AlkB domain. However, other viruses may be utilising
naturally occurring AlkB proteins in the host. Viruses have
to rely on a number of host proteins in order to replicate
[28]. In some cases it is probably beneficial for the virus to
integrate such genes into their own genome in order to
ensure that they are accessible, although there will be a
trade off between this advantage and the increased cost of
maintaining a larger genome [29].
However, there is an alternative hypothesis with respect to
the AlkB integration that also has to be considered. As discussed above, the AlkB domain seems to have been integrated relatively recently in viruses found at very different
geographical locations, and the only obvious connection
seems to be that most viruses belong to a subset of the
Flexiviridae. However, the source of these viruses points at
another common feature. As seen from the table given in
Additional file 1, AlkB domains are often found in viruses
associated with grapevine, apple, cherry, citrus and blueberry – crops where the usage of pesticides is common. It
is known that several common pesticides (e.g. methyl bromide and some organophosphorus compounds) may
cause methylation of DNA and RNA [30-33]. An
integrated repair domain for methylation damage as part
of the viral replication complex would therefore give the
virus a competitive advantage in a highly methylating
environment. The application of such pesticides would
probably also stimulate AlkB production e.g. in co-infecting bacteria, giving these viruses easy access to AlkB
mRNA for integration into their RNA genome.
It could be argued that a more active PTGS system in these
plants would give a similar effect. However, in that case
we would expect to see more ancient integrations of AlkB
domains. It could also be argued that the presence of AlkB
domains may be an artefact caused by promiscuous viral
domains picking up available mRNA sequences during
cultivation of viruses in the laboratory. However, given
the large number of different laboratories involved, and
the number of different hosts used (data not shown), this
seems to be a very unlikely explanation.
The hypothesis that environmental compounds, in particular pesticides, may have provoked the integration of AlkB
domains into the viral genomes depends upon a high
mutation rate and frequent integrations of non-viral
domains. The integrations have to be recent, not only in

Page 12 of 15
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Genomics 2005, 6:1

relative terms, compared to other domains in the same
genome, but also in absolute terms, compared to the
progress of modern agriculture. The integrations also have
to be frequent, in the sense that it is likely that integration
could have happened several times, in different biotopes.
It is difficult to estimate mutation rates in RNA viruses.
They evolve very rapidly, and it is often difficult to assign
reliable phylogenies. However, recent studies indicate that
most ssRNA viruses have a mutation rate close to 10-3 substitutions per site per year [34], e.g. the SARS virus has
1.16–3.30 × 10-3 non-synonymous substitutions per site
per year, which is considered to be a "moderate" ssRNA
mutation rate [34]. If we assume that most ssRNA viruses
have effective mutation rates within the same order of
magnitude, a realistic mutation rate for the viruses
included here might be something like 2.0 × 10-3. In that
case, the MT, HEL and RdRp trees shown in Additional file
2 represent approximately between 325 and 750 years of
evolution. In general the NJ trees estimate a slightly
shorter evolutionary history (between 325 and 450 years)
compared to the ML trees (between 550 and 750 years). In
this estimate the Ampelovirus sequences have not been
included, as they seem to have diverged from the
remaining AlkB-containing viruses at a much earlier stage.
If we believe that the AlkB integrations happened after the
divergence of most sequence included here, as indicated
by the lack of co-evolution in Figure 4, it does not seem
unrealistic to assume that most of these integrations happened within the last 50 – 100 years or so. This estimate is
of course very approximate, in particular since we do not
know the true mutation rate of these viruses. However, it
shows that a likely time span for AlkB integration is compatible with the evolution of modern agriculture. Unfortunately, because of the lack of any robust phylogeny for
the viral AlkB sequences it does not make sense to do a
similar estimate for that domain.
Although it is generally accepted that viruses frequently
use recombination to acquire functionality [35], it is less
well known how often this includes nonviral sequences.
However, there are some well-documented examples, and
in particular the properties of the ssRNA positive-strand
Pestivirus may be relevant in this context. There are two
biotopes of the pestiviruses, cytopathogenic (cp) and noncytopatogenic (noncp). The host is infected by the noncp
form which is converted into the cp form by integration of
a fragment of a cellular gene into the viral genome [36].
This introduces a protease cleavage site in the polyprotein.
However, the important point here is that this happens as
part of the normal infection process. It has been suggested
that the integration is facilitated by the viral polymerase
undergoing two subsequent template switches during
minus-strand synthesis [37], although nonreplicative
RNA recombination also may be a possibility [38]. Inte-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/6/1

gration of cellular sequences have also been observed in
other viruses, e.g. in influenza virus [39]. This shows that
at least some viruses do have efficient mechanisms for
recruitment of host genes into the viral genome. Therefore
a recent and rapid integration of AlkB domains into
selected plant virus genomes does not seem to be an
unlikely scenario.
This study has focused on the AlkB domain, mainly as an
attempt to get a better understanding of potential functions associated with this domain. However, it is likely
that additional information about integration patterns
and the relative importance of de novo integration vs.
recombination can be achieved by a closer investigation
of the other variable domains, e.g. by looking at how they
correlate with the evolution of the AlkB domains.

Conclusions
We believe that the viral AlkB-like domains are conventional repair domains targeted towards the viral RNA. The
integration of AlkB domains into viral genomes may have
been provoked by environmental methylating agents, e.g.
the introduction of DNA/RNA-methylating pesticides in
farming. The hypothesis [1] that the domain interferes
with the PTGS system of plants can not be excluded, but
seems to be less consistent with observed features of the
AlkB integration.

Methods
The NCBI nr protein sequence database was searched with
PSI-Blast [40], with the output limited to viral sequences.
Multiple alignments were made with ClustalX version 1.8
[41]. The phylogenetic tree in Figure 2 was made from
ClustalX alignments by MEGA2 [42], using the
neighbour-joining (NJ) approach with complete deletion
of gap positions, Poisson correction of distances and 500
bootstrap steps. Phylogenetic trees for sequence regions
from sequences with AlkB domains were made with the
NJ approach as described above, but with 10.000 bootstrap steps. Corresponding trees were also made by the
maximum likelihood approach (ML) by Tree-Puzzle version 5.2 [43], using an exact likelihood function, the VT
matrix [44] and 10.000 puzzling steps. The trees from
Tree-Puzzle were visualised with TreeView version 1.6.6
[45], and the NJ and ML trees were compared with Component version 2.0 [46]. Significance of pairwise tree distances were estimated using the data of Day [12]. Pairwise
distances between sequences, for comparing evolution of
AlkB domains to other viral domains, were computed
directly from ClustalX alignments with local tools, using
the Blosum50 mutation matrix [47], but without any correction for multiple substitutions. Motifs in protein
sequences were identified using HMMER version 2.3.2
[48] with the Pfam library version 11.0 [49]. A Pfam-type
profile for the methyltransferase domains of Flexiviridae

and Tymoviridae was generated from a ClustalX alignment,
using hmmbuild and hmmcalibrate from the HMMER
package. Visualisation of motif positions in viral
sequences was generated directly from the HMMER output files using a local tool as an interface to the GNU [50]
groff software. Systematic large scale searches with polyprotein subsequences were done locally with PSI-Blast
and the NCBI reference sequence database [15]. Dot plots
for comparison of viral protein sequences were generated
with Dotter version 3.0 [51].
