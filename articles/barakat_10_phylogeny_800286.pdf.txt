Abstract
Background: Cinnamyl Alcohol Dehydrogenase (CAD) proteins function in lignin biosynthesis and play a critical role in
wood development and plant defense against stresses. Previous phylogenetic studies did not include genes from
seedless plants and did not reflect the deep evolutionary history of this gene family. We reanalyzed the phylogeny of
CAD and CAD-like genes using a representative dataset including lycophyte and bryophyte sequences. Many CAD/CADlike genes do not seem to be associated with wood development under normal growth conditions. To gain insight into
the functional evolution of CAD/CAD-like genes, we analyzed their expression in Populus plant tissues in response to
feeding damage by gypsy moth larvae (Lymantria dispar L.). Expression of CAD/CAD-like genes in Populus tissues (xylem,
leaves, and barks) was analyzed in herbivore-treated and non-treated plants by real time quantitative RT-PCR.
Results: CAD family genes were distributed in three classes based on sequence conservation. All the three classes are
represented by seedless as well as seed plants, including the class of bona fide lignin pathway genes. The expression of
some CAD/CAD-like genes that are not associated with xylem development were induced following herbivore damage
in leaves, while other genes were induced in only bark or xylem tissues. Five of the CAD/CAD-like genes, however,
showed a shift in expression from one tissue to another between non-treated and herbivore-treated plants. Systemic
expression of the CAD/CAD-like genes was generally suppressed.
Conclusions: Our results indicated a correlation between the evolution of the CAD gene family and lignin and that the
three classes of genes may have evolved in the ancestor of land plants. Our results also suggest that the CAD/CAD-like
genes have evolved a diversity of expression profiles and potentially different functions, but that they are nonetheless
co-regulated under stress conditions.
Background
Lignin is a phenolic heteropolymer that plays a central
role in plant structure by providing rigidity and hydrophobicity to xylem cell walls [1], which facilitates the conduction of water and minerals throughout the plant body
[2]. The lignin synthesis pathway involves many substrates and enzymes, among which the CAD enzyme catalyzes the last step in the synthesis of monolignol
precursors. While mutations in a single real CAD gene

rarely affect growth of transgenic plants, some natural
mutants or double mutants have shown abnormal developmental and structural phenotypes. For instance, Arabidopsis plants with double mutations in the two major
CAD genes associated with lignin biosynthesis (AtCAD3
and AtCAD4) present prostrate stems linked to weakness
of the vasculature, as well as a reduction in the stem size
and diameter [3]. The natural brown midrib (bm) mutants
in sorghum and maize [4-6] which presented 20% reduction in lignin content [7,8], showed several phenotypic
variations including increased lodging, reduced yield, regrowth, height, variation in the flowering time, and tillering in some environments, compared to wild type counterparts.

Lignin plays an important role in plant defense against
insects and pathogens [9-12]. Lignin functions as a physical impediment, either physically blocking pathogen
entry or increasing leaf toughness to make chewing by
herbivores more difficult. While lignin synthesis is a central component of most plant growth, the rate of lignin
synthesis can be accelerated by herbivory or pathogen
attack. The rapid deposition of lignin or lignin-like materials may inhibit further growth and confine the invading
pathogen or reduce the fecundity of an herbivore [13-18].
For instance, infection of Populus with the rust fungus,
Melampsora larici-populina, led to a strong accumulation of monolignols within two days of infection [19].
Similarly, Norway spruce bark and cambium inoculated
with the bark beetle associated fungal pathogen, Ceratocystis polonica, became partially or completely lignified
surrounding the inoculation site [20,21]. Lignin functions
in plant defense against herbivores by increasing leaf
toughness and decreasing leaf nutritional content [22].
Moreover, lignin production can be altered in response to
herbivore feeding [23]. Considering the importance of
lignin in plant defense and the effect of herbivory on the
phenylpropanoid pathway [24-29], it is not surprising
that previous studies have shown an increase in the
expression of CAD/CAD-like genes in plants infected
with pests and pathogens [30-32].
In Populus, we reported 15 CAD/CAD-like genes distributed in three main classes [33]. However, our phylogeny in that study [33] did not include sequences from
seedless plants and could not draw clearly the complete
evolutionary history of this gene family. Among the
CAD/CAD-like genes in Populus, only two (PoptrCAD4
and PoptrCAD10) have been shown to be preferentially
expressed in xylem under normal growth conditions. In
contrast, three Populus genes (PoptrCAD7, PoptrCAD12,
and PoptrCAD13) are preferentially expressed in leaves,
and one gene is preferentially expressed in both leaves
and xylem (PoptrCAD9). The functions of Populus CAD/
CAD-like genes, except PoptrCAD4 and PoptrCAD10,
are still unknown. Phylogenetic analysis has shown that
all the bona fide lignin pathway CAD genes studied so far
belong to Class I [33]. Populus Sinapyl Alcohol Dehydrogenase (SAD) genes [33,34] as well as Arabidopsis
AtCAD4, AtCAD6, and AtCAD5 genes, which have been
shown to be associated with lignin biosynthesis [35], were
distributed in Class II. We do not know whether the distribution of CAD/CAD-like genes in three main classes
reflects a functional divergence and several questions
related to the phylogeny and the function of CAD/CADlike genes remain to be answered. For instance, are Class I
genes associated only with xylem development while
Class II and Class III genes function in defense against
biotic stresses? Do genes from the three classes compensate for each other both under normal growth and stress

conditions? Will different CAD/CAD-like genes respond
similarly to herbivore stress? Will herbivore-mediated
expression of the CAD/CAD-like gene family members
differ between physically damaged tissue and systemic,
undamaged tissue?
To address these questions, we re-analyzed the phylogeny of CAD/CAD-like genes using a dataset that includes
sequences from a moss and a lycophyte. We also used
quantitative RT-PCR to analyze the expression of ten
CAD/CAD-like genes in several tissues (leaves, bark,
xylem systemic, and undamaged leaf tissue) from hybrid
Populus plants challenged with gypsy moth larvae and
unchallenged control plants. These studies permitted us
to relate the evolution of lignin and the CAD family, and
to get insight into the evolution of gene functionalization
within the family.

Results
Phylogeny of CAD/CAD-like genes

Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using maximum
likelihood with protein sequences from over 40 species
belonging to various land plant lineages (see Additional
file 1 Table S1). The analysis showed that CAD/CAD-like
genes are distributed in three major classes (Fig. 1). The
distribution of genes in Class I and III are supported with
good bootstrap values (100 and 63 for Class I and Class
III respectively), while Class II is not as well supported
(bootstrap value = 49). Class I (bona fide lignin gene
class) and Class III CAD/CAD-like genes include
sequences from angiosperm and moss (Physcomitrella).
However, Class III is represented by sequences from
angiosperms and moss but not the lycopod Selaginella.
In Class I, II, and III, genes from seedless plants cluster
separately from the angiosperms. The distribution of
CAD/CAD-like genes in the tree shows evidence of several plant-specific or lineage specific duplications. Class
III includes few genes from both monocots and eudicots
but no gymnosperm sequences. In all three classes,
sequences from monocots, eudicots, gymnosperms, and
seedless plants cluster separately indicating that events
that contributed to the duplication of these genes have
occurred after the splits of those lineages from each
other.
Expression profiling of CAD genes in herbivore-damaged
tissues

In Populus, the CAD/CAD-like gene family is represented
by 15 genes [33]. However, only two genes (PoptrCAD4
and PoptrCAD10) are preferentially expressed in xylem,
where lignin deposition is required to increase plant tensile strength. Most of the remaining genes are induced in
leaves and/or bark [33]. To determine which of the Populus CAD/CAD-like genes are associated with response to
herbivory, we analyzed the expression of 10 CAD/CAD-

like genes using quantitative RT-PCR in various tissues
from plants challenged with Lymantria dispar. To
address questions related to the evolution of CAD/CADlike genes, we selected ten genes representing all phylogenetic clusters in the three classes of CAD/CAD-like genes
and presenting different expression patterns in nonstressed plants. We searched for a local response by analyzing the expression in tissues (leaves, bark, and xylem)
directly in contact with the herbivores, even though
gypsy moth only feed on the foliage. Real time RT-PCR
experiments showed that six of the ten CAD/CAD-like
genes studied exhibited a preferential expression in at
least one of the tissues analyzed (Fig. 2). The expression
profiles of CAD/CAD-like genes in tissues from stressed
plants can be divided in five groups: The group 1 genes
(PoptrCAD4 and PoptrCAD11) showed a preferential
expression in xylem. The group 2 genes (PoptrCAD4,
PoptrCAD3, and PoptrCAD15) showed an induced
expression in leaves. The only gene in group 3
(PoptrCAD7) is highly induced in the bark. Group 4
genes (PoptrCAD2, PoptrCAD5, PoptrCAD12, and
PoptrCAD14) showed similar expression profiles in all
tissues from stressed and control plants, and thus appear
to be constitutively expressed. Finally, the expression of
the one gene in Group 5 (PoptrCAD10) is suppressed in
xylem.
While PoptrCAD4 from group 1 was preferentially
expressed in xylem, PoptrCAD11 showed similar expression levels in xylem, bark, and leaves under normal
growth conditions [33]. The expression of PoptrCAD11
and PoptrCAD4 at least doubled in xylem tissues challenged with Lymantria dispar. PoptrCAD4 and
PoptrCAD10, which are associated with lignin biosynthesis during development, present different expression patterns under herbivore stress. While PoptrCAD4 is highly
induced in xylem from stressed plants, PoptrCAD10
showed a lower level of expression in treated plants.
PoptrCAD7, which showed a preferential expression in
the leaf under normal growth conditions, changed the
location (shifted) of its preferential expression to the bark
under herbivory conditions. PoptrCAD2, PoptrCAD5,
PoptrCAD12 and PoptrCAD14 did not show any expression difference in tissues from stressed and non-stressed
plants. One-way ANOVA results showed a large variation
in gene expression between tissues in non-treated plants
(except genes PoptrCAD2, PoptrCAD11, PoptrCAD12,
and PoptrCAD15) and herbivore treated plants (except
PoptrCAD12 and PoptrCAD15).
Expression profiling of CAD genes in systemic leaves

To test if the differential expression of CAD/CAD-like
genes shown in Populus plants challenged with herbivores was systemic, we analyzed the expression in leaves
that were not in contact with herbivores (systemic leaves)

Page 4 of 11

(Fig. 3). Five of the ten CAD/CAD-like genes
(PoptrCAD10, PoptrCAD15, PoptrCAD12, PoptrCAD5,
and PoptrCAD11) were significantly down-regulated in
the systemic leaves. The other five genes, PoptrCAD2,
PoptrCAD3, PoptrCAD4, PoptrCAD7 and PoptrCAD14,
were not affected by herbivory in systemic leaves. To
compare the response of CAD/CAD-like genes between
directly treated and systemic leaves, we analyzed the
expression level of two different genes (PoptrCAD3 and
PoptrCAD15). The analysis showed that the expression of
PoptrCAD3 and PoptrCAD15 was higher in the directly
treated leaves from stressed plants compared to control
plants (Fig. 4). However, the expression of these two
genes was very low in systemic leaves from stressed
plants compared to control plants.
Expression of the rubisco gene in directly treated and
systemically induced tissues

Plants tend to redirect their metabolism in response to
herbivory in ways that affect both the damaged and
undamaged parts of the plant [36,37]. To check whether
the low expression level of CAD/CAD-like genes
observed in non-treated tissues was linked to an overall
lower metabolism in those tissues, we analyzed the
expression of the rubisco gene, as rubisco and other photosynthetic genes are known to be suppressed by herbivory [38-42]. In our experiment, the expression of the
rubisco gene was induced in directly treated leaves and
was repressed in the systemic undamaged leaves (Fig. 5).

Discussion
Phylogenetic analysis of CAD/CAD-like genes published
recently by our group [33] used a sequence dataset that
did not include seedless plant sequences. This limited
insights into the evolution of CAD/CAD-like genes in
relationship with the evolution of lignin in land plants.
Here we re-analyzed the phylogeny of CAD/CAD-like
genes using sequences from the ten plants for which the
genomes are completely sequenced including the moss
Physcomitrella and the lycopod Selaginella. Phylogenetic
analysis showed that CAD/CAD-like genes, except four
Selaginella
sequences
(SmoCAD6,
SmoCAD7,
SmoCAD8, and SmoCAD9) are distributed in three
classes. This resulting tree is in agreement with our previous results [33], however the origin of all classes of CAD/
CAD-like genes in seed plants from genes previously
residing in mosses is now documented. The four Selaginella sequences that do not cluster with the other genes
could correspond to other dehydrogenase genes that are
highly similar to CAD/CAD-like genes. Two of the three
classes (Class I and Class III) are well supported while
Class II is not. Class I and Class II include genes from
both Physcomitrella and Selaginella. This indicates that
the evolution of these two classes happened in the ances-

tor of land plants. Class III includes a sequence from Physcomitrella which is the most basal among the Class III
genes, but neither Selaginella nor gymnosperm
sequences. This suggests that Class III may represent the
first CAD genes that evolved with or after the divergence
of mosses from lycophytes. The lack of gymnosperm

of the current incomplete coverage of the transcriptome
of gymnosperm plants. The distribution of bona fide
CAD genes (Class I) in a monophyletic clade including
sequences from mosses, lycophytes, gymnosperms, and
angiosperms is an indication that the real CAD genes
existed in the ancestor of land plants and their evolution
is intimately associated with the evolution of lignin. This
is in agreement with previous studies showing that Selaginella has real lignin [43]. Other studies have reported
lignin in red alga Calliarthron cheilosporioides [44], but it
was suggested that this was the result of convergent evolution. Class II and Class III corresponding CAD-like
genes seems to be the result of duplications that had happen in the ancestor of land plants. Some of these genes
still function in lignin biosynthesis under normal growth
conditions as was exemplified by PoptrCAD10 and

AtCAD6 [33,35]. The other CAD-like genes may function
in lignin biosynthesis under various stress conditions or
have evolved different functions. For instance, a compilation of Populus gene expression data from the PopGenIE
database [19,45,46] showed that several CAD/CAD-like
genes (PoptrCAD5, PoptrCAD7, PoptrCAD14, and
PoptrCAD12), as well as others not studied here
(PoptrCAD6, PoptrCAD13, and PoptrCAD1), were found
to be induced under biotic (rust infection) and abiotic
stresses (mechanical damage, drought, ozone, UV-B, and
elevated CO2). Furthermore, it was suggested that the
Quercus QsCAD1 gene functions in plant defense against
Phytophthora cinnamomi by deactivation of toxins produced by this pathogen [32]. Whatever the nature of
defense mechanisms they belong to, the phylogenetic distribution of CAD-like genes suggests that the evolution of
these mechanisms had occurred in the ancestor of land
plants, which seems to be already targets of pests and
pathogens back at that time.
A recent study [33] showed that within the 15 CAD/
CAD-like genes from Populus trichocarpa, only
PoptrCAD4 and PoptrCAD10 genes are preferentially
expressed in xylem and seem to be associated with wood
development. The other CAD/CAD-like genes present
various expression profiles and most are induced in
leaves or bark. It has been suggested that these genes are
involved in defense against plant pathogen attack. For
instance, plant treatments with [sulphinyl] acetic acid, 1.1
dimethyl ester (OH-PAS), a specific CAD inhibitor,
reduced the penetration resistance of barley to Puccinia
hordei. It has been also suggested that some CAD/CADlike genes such as QsCAD1 from Quercus suber are
potentially involved in deactivation of toxins produced by
phytopathogens [32]. Other studies [47-51] reported a
correlation between plant infections by pathogens or herbivore attack and either the amount of lignin or an
increase in the expression of lignin pathway associated
genes including CAD/CAD-like genes. In this study, we
analyzed the expression of 10 of the 15 CAD/CAD-like
genes in various tissues of Populus plants challenged with
Lymantria dispar and that CAD/CAD-like genes present
various expression profiles indicating a highly probable
functional divergence of genes within this family. Six of
the genes studied showed preferential expression in at
least one tissue from the stressed plants, suggesting that
CAD/CAD-like genes act together in defending the plant
against pathogen attack. Genes from functional group 1
(PoptrCAD4, PoptrCAD11) and group 3 (PoptrCAD7)
showed differential expression in xylem and bark, respectively. PoptrCAD4 and PoptrCAD11 share promoter
motifs involved in response to methyl-jasmonate (MeJa),
abscisic acid (ABA), and wounding [33]. PoptrCAD7 possess several motifs including the ones involved in MeJa
and wound response [33]. This gene was previously

Page 7 of 11

reported as having been induced following MeJa, wounding, rust infection, and UV treatments [19,45,46]. The
induction of those genes in the bark and xylem could be
linked to the extensive damage caused to the leaves by the
herbivore. It is highly probable that after losing a large
fraction of their leaves, the plants respond by protecting
the main stem. Genes from group 2 (PoptrCAD3,
PoptrCAD4 and PoptrCAD15) showed preferential
expression in leaves from herbivore-stressed plants.
PoptrCAD4 also showed preferential expression in xylem
in stressed plants. Promoter sequence analysis, showed
that these three genes shared several motifs including
some involved in response to defense against biotic and
abiotic stress such as MeJA and ABA [52-55]. This is also
in accordance with results from previous studies
[19,45,46] showing that poptrCAD4 was induced under
MeJA, mechanical damage, drought, UV-B, ozone treatments and rust infection. PoptrCAD15 was shown to be
induced under drought and elevated CO2. The constitutive expression of those genes in leaves under normal
conditions and their increase in expression in damaged
leaves and stems suggests that these genes play an important role in defense against herbivore attack, or at the
very least are responsive to herbivore stress.
PoptrCAD2,
PoptrCAD5,
PoptrCAD12
and
PoptrCAD14 did not show any difference in expression
between tissues from stressed and non-stressed plants.
These genes present similar motifs as the ones preferentially expressed in tissues from stressed plants. These
motifs are involved in response to MeJA, ABA, wounding, and fungal elicitors. The similar expression profile in
various tissues between non-stressed and stressed tissues
despite the presence in their promoter sequences of several motifs involved in response to biotic and abiotic
stresses indicates that those genes may be involved in
response to other types of stress than herbivory. This
assumption is in accordance with previous results showing that PoptrCAD12 and PoptrCAD14 were induced following MeJA treatment, drought, and elevated CO2
[45,46].
Three of the ten genes (PoptrCAD3, PoptrCAD11 and
PoptrCAD15) analyzed were induced in herbivorestressed plants (Table 1). PoptrCAD3 and PoptrCAD15
genes, which showed similar expression among tissues in
the non-stressed plants, were induced in leaves of treated
plants. A similar situation was shown for PoptrCAD11,
which was induced in the xylem of treated plants. Two
genes (PoptrCAD4 and PoptrCAD7) showed a shift in
expression profiles between non-stressed and herbivore
stressed plants (Table 1). PoptrCAD4, which showed
preferential expression in xylem in non-stressed plants,
was induced upon herbivory in both xylem and leaves.
PoptrCAD7, which was preferentially expressed in leaves
in non-stressed plants, showed a high level of expression

in the bark of treated plants. These results show that
plants induce upon stress the expression of CAD-like
genes that are expressed at only low levels during normal
plant development. The results also suggest that the
expression of other genes such as bona fide lignin biosynthesis genes may shift expression (change specificity) to
other tissues to defend against pathogens. These results
rule against the hypothesis of absolute functional divergence between bona fide CAD genes and CAD-like genes.
It is likely that genes from the three classes are still
involved in lignin biosynthesis but have evolved specialized expression profiles.
Phylogenetic analyses of Populus CAD/CAD-like genes
showed that PoptrCAD2 and PoptrCAD11 are paralogs.
In this study we observed that these two genes present a
striking difference in their expression profiles in stressed
plants (Table 1). PoptrCAD11 is highly induced in xylem
from stressed plants compared to PoptrCAD2. In nonstressed plants, however, both genes showed similar
expression patterns in the tissues analyzed [33]. A similar
situation was observed for the paralogs PoptrCAD3 and
PoptrCAD5. While PoptrCAD5 presented similar expression profiles between non-stressed and stressed plants,
PoptrCAD3 was increased in expression in leaves of
stressed plants. The expression profiles suggest that the
duplication which created the PoptrCAD3 and
PoptrCAD5, and the PoptrCAD2 and PoptrCAD11 gene
pairs has been followed by a diversification in expression.
Comparison of gene expression in damaged and systemic leaves showed a down regulation of most CAD/
CAD-like genes in systemic leaves from stressed plants

compared to their counterparts from non-stressed plants.
This phenomenon may be linked to a re-allocation of
plant resources that has been previously reported, in
which the increase in resource utilization for the defense
of damaged leaves translates into a slower general metabolism in non-damaged parts of the plant [36,37]. Our
result of differential expression of the rubisco gene, as a
marker for primary metabolism, in non-treated leaves
both in stressed and non-stressed plants, is suggestive
that such reallocation of resources is occurring in poplar
in response to herbivory, which could help explain the
suppressed CAD expression levels systemically in
stressed plants. This also indicates that future studies
should include the collection of metabolic data to evaluate resource reallocation to confirm if the low expression
of CAD/CAD-like genes in non-treated tissues reflects a
redirection of metabolic flux to the damaged tissues
rather than systemic induction of defense genes, rather
than a lack of a systemic defense response.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we confirmed the distribution of CAD/
CAD-like genes in plants into into three phylogenetic
classes that evolved in the ancestor of land plants. We
have shown that the expression of genes in the CAD/
CAD-like family is coordinated in tissues under both normal growth and under biotic stress conditions. Some
CAD/CAD-like genes in Populus that do not function in
lignin biosynthesis in xylem may function together in
defense against pest attack. We demonstrated that Populus CAD/CAD-like genes may play their role in defense in

a complex tissue-specific manner. We showed that duplicate CAD/CAD-like genes have evolved different expression profiles and may have or be evolving towards
modified functions as well. Finally, these results take us a
step closer to understanding functional divergence
among CAD/CAD-like genes, a key gene family in the
evolution of land plants.

Methods
Plant material

Leaves, bark, and stem secondary xylem were collected
from young hybrid Populus OGY (P. deltoides × P. nigra)
trees grown in a culture chamber at 25°C and 18°C during
the day and night, respectively. The plants were grown at
16 h/8 h day/night light regime and at 60% humidity. For
herbivore treatments, we enclosed 10 gypsy moth
(Lymantria dispar) larvae within mesh bags that contained leaves from LPI 8-15 (Fig. 6). Control plants were
bagged on the same position but without insect larvae.
Tissues were harvested from directly treated damaged
and systemic (non-damaged three top rows of leaves)
after 24 hours herbivory. Tissues were frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at -80°C until use.
Sequences alignment and phylogenetic analyses

Sequences used in the phylogenetic analysis include the
dataset from [33] to which we added sequences from the
genomes of Physcomitrella patens and Selaginella
moellendorffii retrieved from JGI [56]. Sequence alignments and phylogenies were constructed as previously
described [33].
RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis

Total RNA was isolated using a CTAB method [57] with
minor modifications. The RNA quality and concentration

was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent
Technologies). To remove any contaminating genomic
DNA, RNA samples were treated with RNase-free DNase
(Applied Biosystems) before RT-PCR experiments were
conducted. RNA was reverse transcribed using random
primers from the High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) following the manufacturer's recommendations. One microgram of total
RNA from each sample was reverse-transcribed for each
single RT-PCR reaction.
CAD/CAD-like gene expression analysis using quantitative
real time RT-PCR

Quantitative real time PCR reactions were performed as
described previously [33]. In summary, reactions were
prepared using the SYBR Green Master Mix kit (Applied
Biosystems) and performed in an Applied Biosystems
7500 Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems)
with default parameters. Primers used in this study were
designed using Primer Express® software (Applied Biosystems). We used the gene encoding the 18 S rRNA as an
endogenous control for normalization for template quantity. Dissociation curves were used to verify the specificity of PCR amplification. Expression analyses were
performed on three biological replicates (three trees) and
three experimental replicates. Data was evaluated using
the 7500 Fast System SDS software procedures (Applied
Biosystems). Statistical analyses were performed using
Statistica 6.0 software (StatSoft Poland Inc., Tulsa, OH,
USA).
