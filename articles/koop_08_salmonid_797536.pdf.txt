Abstract
Background: Salmonids are of interest because of their relatively recent genome duplication, and their extensive use
in wild fisheries and aquaculture. A comprehensive gene list and a comparison of genes in some of the different species
provide valuable genomic information for one of the most widely studied groups of fish.
Results: 298,304 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from Atlantic salmon (69% of the total), 11,664 chinook, 10,813
sockeye, 10,051 brook trout, 10,975 grayling, 8,630 lake whitefish, and 3,624 northern pike ESTs were obtained in this
study and have been deposited into the public databases. Contigs were built and putative full-length Atlantic salmon
clones have been identified. A database containing ESTs, assemblies, consensus sequences, open reading frames, gene
predictions and putative annotation is available. The overall similarity between Atlantic salmon ESTs and those of rainbow
trout, chinook, sockeye, brook trout, grayling, lake whitefish, northern pike and rainbow smelt is 93.4, 94.2, 94.6, 94.4,
92.5, 91.7, 89.6, and 86.2% respectively. An analysis of 78 transcript sets show Salmo as a sister group to Oncorhynchus
and Salvelinus within Salmoninae, and Thymallinae as a sister group to Salmoninae and Coregoninae within Salmonidae.
Extensive gene duplication is consistent with a genome duplication in the common ancestor of salmonids. Using all of the
available EST data, a new expanded salmonid cDNA microarray of 32,000 features was created. Cross-species
hybridizations to this cDNA microarray indicate that this resource will be useful for studies of all 68 salmonid species.
Conclusion: An extensive collection and analysis of salmonid RNA putative transcripts indicate that Pacific salmon,
Atlantic salmon and charr are 94–96% similar while the more distant whitefish, grayling, pike and smelt are 93, 92, 89 and
86% similar to salmon. The salmonid transcriptome reveals a complex history of gene duplication that is consistent with
an ancestral salmonid genome duplication hypothesis. Genome resources, including a new 32 K microarray, provide
valuable new tools to study salmonids.

Background
Extensive knowledge of trout and salmon is a result of
their widespread use in scientific research, as an environmental sentinel species and as a food and sport fish. Perhaps more is known about the physiology, ecology,
genetics, behavior and biology of salmonids than any
other fish group [1]. This background provides a wealth of
data from an economically important and phylogenetically distinct group of fish that can help guide, and benefit
from, new genomic studies.
The Salmonidae family includes: whitefish and ciscos
(subfamily Coregoninae); graylings (Thymallinae); trout,
salmon and charr (Salmoninae) [2]. Salmonids are classified into nine genera and sixty-eight species. They are
native of the cooler climates of the Northern Hemisphere,
but have been widely introduced around the world. Salmonids belong to a basal teleost Protacanthopterygii suborder (smelt, pike and salmon) group, which has been
separated from other well studied euteleost lineages such
as Ostariophysi (zebrafish, catfish, flathead minnow,
etc.), and Acanthopterygii (cod, cichlids, fugu, sticklebacks, rockfish) for 217–290 MY [2-5].
The common ancestor of salmonids is purported to have
experienced a whole genome duplication event between
25 and 100 MYA [6,7]. Extant salmonids are considered
pseudo-tetraploid as they are in the later stages of reverting to a stable diploid state. Evidence for the ancestral salmonid autotetraploid genome duplication includes:
multivalent chromosome formation during male meiosis
and evidence for tetrasomic segregation at some loci [6];
one of the larger euteleost genome sizes (3–4.5 pg) with
double that of sister groups Esociformes (0.8–1.8 pg,
pike) and Osmeriformes (0.7 pg, smelt) [8]; homeologous chromosomal segments based on recent genetic
maps and comparative studies using microsatellite markers, and duplicated gene family studies such as Hox, Major
Histocompatibility complex (MH), growth hormone, and
nineteen allozymes [6,9-12].
The genome duplication in salmonids is the most recent
genome duplication in this lineage. There are now a
number of studies and good evidence, primarily from
sequenced zebrafish and pufferfish genome sequences, for
tetraploidization/rediploidization early in the ray-finned
fish lineage (350–400 MYA) [13-16]. Several of these
studies have suggested that the ancestral fish duplication,
in addition to the two ancestral vertebrate genome duplications, are part of the reason why ray-finned fishes make
up nearly half of all extant vertebrates species and exhibit
tremendous biodiversity affecting their morphology, ecology, behavior and evolution.
Vertebrate species diversity and body plan diversity have
commonly been linked to genome duplications, although

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/545

there is some debate on how well we can draw these conclusions based on the very old genome duplications commonly studied. Mechanistically, how a genome
reorganizes itself to cope with duplicated chromosomes,
gene dosage effects, and the role of gene duplications for
evolution and adaptation are long-standing issues in biology that remain unresolved [6,13-17]. The number and
diversity of salmonid species, and their relatively recent
genome duplication, make salmonids ideal for examining
recent events that could have played such a pivotal role in
generating gene diversity and species diversity found in
modern vertebrates.
The genomics resources of salmonids are being rapidly
expanded through a few large-scale genomics programs
[18-23]. Here we identify 354,061 new ESTs from Atlantic
salmon and several other salmonid and related species in
order to obtain a comprehensive view of the salmonid
transcriptome, identify species relationships, identify
gene duplications and introduce a new 32 K microarray
tool for transcriptome analysis.

Results and discussion
cDNA libraries
New, directionally cloned, mixed tissue (brain, kidney
and spleen), normalized cDNA libraries were constructed
for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar; European McConnell,
and Canadian, Saint John River strains), chinook salmon
(Oncorhynchus tschawytscha), sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), grayling (Thymallus
thymallus), and northern pike (Esox lucius). Separate normalized libraries were constructed from Salmo salar thymus, thyroid, and head kidney tissues. In addition, one
full-length, mixed tissue, large insert (> 2 kb), non-normalized library was constructed to identify longer gene
transcripts. cDNA clones were isolated, purified and
sequenced from the 5' and 3' ends. Clone numbers and
insert sizes for the different libraries and species that were
done as part of this study are listed in Table 1.
Transcript analysis: sequence and assembly
To obtain a comprehensive list of genes in salmonids, we
used a strategy of deep 5' and 3' EST sequencing from a
few high quality libraries. This approach complements
previous studies, which examined more limited EST surveys of cDNA libraries from a large number of different
tissues and developmental stages [18-22]. For Atlantic
salmon, over 30,000 clones were sequenced from each of
the thymus, thyroid, and head kidney tissue libraries.
From previously described normalized libraries, [19]
9,584 additional clones were sequenced from the Atlantic
salmon pyloric caecum tissue library and 60,288 additional clones were sequenced from a mixed tissue library
(rgb2; Table 1). The total number of clones examined
from the rgb2 library was 84,176 which yielded 127,660

sequence reads or 30% of the total Atlantic salmon EST
database. Even with this deep sequencing, nearly 13% of
the last 637 reads were novel (< 99% over 100 bp) and the
maximum redundancy for a single transcript from the
rgb2 library was 58 (Table 1).
The results of the assembly of 298,304 Atlantic salmon
ESTs obtained in this study along with 138,325 ESTs from
previous studies [[19,22], GenBank] are shown in Table 2.
Due to the complexities of the salmonid genome duplication and because it provides a stable, conservative starting
point for all subsequent analyses, our analysis began with
a first stage assembly using stringent parameters (PHRAP:
0.99 repeat stringency and 100 minscore). A second stage
assembly (96% repeat stringency and 300 minscore) was
implemented to combine some of contigs which may be
alleles, or possibly very recent gene duplications (distinguishing among alleles, minor assembly errors, miss-calls
and very recent gene duplications, particularly in lower
quality sequence regions is very difficult in the absence of

genomic sequence data). In Atlantic salmon, 81,398
potential transcripts (2 stage assembly) were identified, of
which 29,844 (37%) were similar (BLASTX, 1e-10) to
annotated sequences in CDD or SwissProt protein databases. For comparison, an assembly of 246,704 ESTs from
rainbow trout [[18,21], GenBank] resulted in 51,199 transcripts, of which 19,266 (38%) had BLASTX hits. Assembled contigs are available [24].
Transcript surveys of additional salmonid species
included 4,800–7,500 clones sequenced from each of chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, brook trout, grayling and
lake whitefish. 11,664 sequences were obtained from chinook salmon, 10,813 sequences from sockeye salmon,
10,051 sequences from brook trout, 10, 975 sequences
from grayling and 8,630 sequences from lake whitefish.
Sequence, assembly and summary statistics are shown for
those data obtained in this study (Table 1) and when
combined with data from public databases (Table 2). In
addition, to provide non-genome-duplicated sister group

comparisons, 2,304 clones were sequenced from northern
pike (3,624 sequences) (Table 1 and 2). For many of these
species, the ESTs provided in this study represent nearly
all or most of the known transcripts. Recently published
data from rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax) [23] was also
included in Table 2.
To examine the relationships among the contig consensus
sequences of Atlantic salmon we compared all contigs
(including singletons) against each other by BLAST and
plotted the number of top pair-wise alignments (E-value
< 1e-50; length > 200 bp) with the identity score (Figure
1). 36,775 contigs showed greater than 80% identity over
200 bp to at least one other contig. Of these, 12,883 were
97–99.9% similar to at least one other contig. These contigs may represent alleles, recent duplicates or errors in
sequence data. 23,892 contigs show between 80 and
96.9% identity with at least one other contig. The large
number of duplicated transcripts observed in the Atlantic
salmon genome is consistent with the hypothesis of an
ancestral salmonid genome duplication, though it is surprising that so many of the duplicated contigs are so similar. This observation is being pursued further in a
separate study. The analysis of contig similarity shows that
the majority of the 81,398 contigs represent distinct transcripts. Note that since the assembly process itself combines sequences with high levels of similarity (> 96%
repeat stringency with minscore > 300; see Methods), very
recent duplications may not all be identified in this process. Furthermore, since the species used in this study differ
by greater than 5% (Table 3), this process would be
expected to identify ancestral salmonid duplications

occurring at or prior to the rainbow trout and Atlantic
salmon speciation.
Determining the number of genes in Atlantic salmon
from the number of EST contigs is difficult for several reasons; 1) the partial representation of genes by EST
sequences may result in several contigs associated with a
single gene transcript, 2) allelic or recently duplicated
genes may be represented by similar but unique transcripts (this latter case is particularly problematic in pseudotetraploid salmonids), 3) alternative splicing,
alternative poly adenylation and termination sites from
the same gene can result in different transcripts, and 4)
transcription products can occur from intergenic regions.
An estimation of the number of genes in salmonids will
require additional information such as full-length cDNA
sequences and gene mapping information.
Salmonid comparisons
Similarity among the different salmonid species was
assessed using the top BLASTN hit against Atlantic salmon
and rainbow trout EST contig databases. The similarity
values from chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, rainbow
trout, Atlantic salmon (McConnell and Saint John River
strains), brook trout, grayling, lake whitefish, northern
pike and rainbow smelt are shown in Table 3. Assembled
contigs (2-stage), rather than individual reads were used
for all comparisons to reduce the impact of redundant
transcripts. Chinook, sockeye, brook trout, grayling and
lake whitefish average 95.5, 95.7, 93.9, 91.3 and 92.2%
identity to rainbow trout, and 94.2, 94.6, 94.4, 91.7 and
92.5% identity to Atlantic salmon with over 87% of the

contigs matching (E-value < 1e-25) at least one contig in
the rainbow trout or Atlantic salmon databases. These
comparisons provide only a very general indication of the
similarity between transcriptomes of various salmonids,
as assemblies contain both 5' (generally genic regions)
and 3' (generally 3'-UTR regions) transcript reads. However, these DNA sequence similarity values correspond
well to the limited number of values in the literature.
Non-coding sequence similarity between rainbow trout
and Atlantic salmon are 95% over 120 kb in MH class IA
and B loci [12], and 93–97% over 4 kb in growth hormone (GH) genes [11]. Similarity between salmon and
whitefish is 90–93% in GH genes [11].
Northern pike and rainbow smelt average 89.4 and 86.1%
identity to rainbow trout and 89.6 and 86.2% identity to
Atlantic salmon, but only 25–39% of these contigs
matched anything in the rainbow trout or Atlantic salmon
database. These latter comparisons have many fewer significant similarities identified partly because of the much
older divergence times [3]. However, the reason for the
lower than expected number of matches between northern pike and rainbow trout or Atlantic salmon is not clear.
While the more distantly related rainbow smelt contigs
show similar numbers of BLASTX hits to protein databases as salmonids, the northern pike contigs showed very
few similarities to Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout contigs (25% compared to 39% for rainbow smelt and 87%
for lake whitefish) and very few BLASTX hits to protein
databases (8% compared to 50% for rainbow smelt and
36% for lake whitefish). One possible explanation may be
due to longer 3'-UTRs in northern pike, but this remains
to be confirmed.
Transcriptome representation
It is difficult to assess how comprehensive the extensive
Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout EST databases are.
However, 73% (37,573 of the 51,199) of all rainbow trout
contigs are also found in Atlantic salmon. Moreover, only
28% of those transcripts unique to rainbow trout
(13,626) have protein hits (E < 1e-25) that support their
legitimacy as genic regions, while other single ESTs may
be from spurious transcription. 91% of lake whitefish
transcripts have a significant similarity (BLASTN comparisons with e-values less than 1e-25) to the Atlantic salmon
or rainbow trout databases. Comparative data from chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, brook trout, grayling, lake
whitefish and rainbow smelt are provided in Table 3.
Overall, these data provide support for extensive gene coverage in salmonid EST databases.
Full-length analysis
The rapid progress of EST sequencing has enabled an estimation of the number of full-length cDNA clones. Fulllength cDNAs (fl-cDNAs) are defined as having a "Start –

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/545

Open Reading Frame (ORF) – Stop – 3' UTR – polyA signal" with the ORF corresponding to a full-length protein.
Given multiple start and stop sites, alternative splicing
and partial homologies to known proteins, it is difficult to
give precise numbers of completed fl-cDNAs. However,
TargetIdentifier (using BLAST comparisons to full-length
genes in databases and Start signals; [25]) identifies
17,399 possible fl-cDNAs (averaging 1,361 bp in length)
from the 81,398 possible transcripts in Atlantic salmon
and 10,453 fl-cDNAs from the 51,199 rainbow trout transcripts. Thus far, about half of the predicted fl-cDNA meet
all of the criteria above, and many of the fl-cDNAs are
already fully characterized on a single clone. These tend to
be the shorter (< 1.5 kb) genes. The list of over 10,000
putative fl-cDNA transcripts assembled from ESTs is available at the GRASP website [24] and further identification
of clones for complete sequence analysis is underway.
Salmonid EST, assembly, ORF and annotation database
All ESTs have been deposited in GenBank, however the
EST assemblies themselves and the resulting consensus
sequences are also very useful in identifying genes. These
assemblies, together with the raw data are available [24].
The assembly consensus sequences are available for
download and for searching using BLAST tools. A contig
visualization tool was developed to allow users to search
for similar consensus sequences using BLAST searches,
identifying consensus names and then visualizing the
sequences, alignment, open-reading frames (ORFs), TargetIdentifier predictions, and BLASTX hits in a single view
(Figure 2: Cluster tools). Until such time as the genomes
are completed, this database provides the salmonid community with access to several levels of EST and gene analyses.
Salmonid phylogeny and gene duplication
The relationships among major groups of salmonids have
been largely unresolved, particularly with respect to the
placement of Salvelinus (represented in this study by
brook trout), Oncorhynchus (represented here by rainbow
trout, chinook and coho salmon) and Salmo (Atlantic
salmon) within Salmoninae, and the placement of Thymallinae (grayling), Coregoninae (whitefish) and Salmoninae (salmon) within Salmonidae [2,11,26-30].
From the EST contigs (Table 2), 78 separate gene sets have
been identified, each of which contained at least one EST
contig sequence from each of five major salmonid genera
(Oncorhynchus, Salmo, Salvelinus, Coregonus, and Thymallus), in addition to representation by a non-salmonid
(Osmerus). Contig sequences within each gene set were
aligned, trimmed to a common length (minimum of 300
bp) and analyzed using phylogenetic methods. 73 of the
78 gene sets could be identified by BLASTX searches to
SwissProt databases (Table 4). For each gene set, a 70%
neighbour-joining (NJ) consensus tree based on 500

bootstrap replicates was generated and the consensus tree
rooted with Osmerus mordax sequences (rainbow smelt).
The single species tree shown in Figure 3 represents a compilation of the phylogenetic results from 78 gene sets. In
the summary tree, each branch is noted by; i) the number
of 70% consensus NJ trees supporting the branch ii) the
number of 70% consensus trees providing no resolution
to the branch point, and iii) the number of consensus
trees that conflict with the shown result. In this summary,
the placement of Salmo as a sister group to Oncorhynchus
and Salvelinus is supported in 18 of the 27 gene consensus
trees for which resolution was found. Eight alternative
consensus trees support grouping Salmo and Salvelinus,
one consensus tree supports grouping Salmo and Oncorhychus, and the remaining 51 trees provide no resolution.
Thus the overall result is in agreement with some of the
more recent studies examining mitochondrial and nine
nuclear genes [26], and suggests good support for grouping Oncorhynchus and Salvelinus apart from Salmo within
the Salmoninae subfamily.

When multiple species are examined, some species may
have both duplication products while other species may
have only one representative. Evidence of an ancestral
duplication is identified in gene trees that contain multiple species trees that may have missing representatives. Of
the 78 gene sets examined in this study, 51 show clear evidence of multiple species trees within gene trees that are
consistent with a gene duplication in the ancestor of Salmonidae, sometime after the separation of Osmeriformes
and Salmoniformes fish. 23 gene sets (Table 4) provided
no evidence for any ancestral gene duplication, and 4 sets
could not be interpreted. The data from 78 gene sets representing 372 consensus sequences and 11,397 bp of
aligned DNA from five salmonid genera, indicate that a
large number of salmonid genes show evidence of extensive gene duplication at a phylogenetic position that is
consistent with the whole genome duplication in the
ancestral Salmonidae hypothesis. Further studies of Esociformes fish will more precisely establish the timing of
some of these gene duplications.

Consistent with traditional nomenclature, the Salmoninae group, which includes Salvelinus, Oncorhynchus and
Salmo is also very well supported with 51 of the 54
resolved trees consistent with this grouping. The three discrepant trees supported a Salmo/Coregonus grouping.

Salmonid 32 K microarray
To use the data generated by ESTs and assemblies for
examining gene expression, a new 32,000 feature cDNA
microarray was developed. This new array is based on the
existing 16 K GRASP array [31] plus 14,496 additional
Atlantic salmon and 1,491 additional rainbow trout contigs that were identified as unique and were successfully
amplified in this study. The 32 K cDNA microarray is composed mainly of 27,917 Atlantic salmon (AS) and 4,065
rainbow trout (RT) cDNA elements or features. 54% of the
elements have fairly stringent (1-e10) hits to annotated
members in public protein databases. Hybridization performance of this array was evaluated using Atlantic
salmon, rainbow trout, coho salmon, brook trout and
lake whitefish RNA obtained from liver organs. The success of hybridization of labeled target to the salmonid elements was judged by the numbers of Atlantic salmon and
rainbow trout elements passing background plus 2 SD
threshold values (see Methods). No transformations or
normalizations were performed on the data. Overall statistics are presented in Table 5. In summary, for RNA isolated from the liver of Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout,
coho salmon, brook trout and lake whitefish, an average
of 48% of the 32,018 elements showed significant detection levels of expression. Comparing these results to that
from the previous 16 K GRASP arrays indicates that doubling the number of elements from 16 K to 32 K resulted
in the ability to assess expression patterns of approximately 61% additional transcripts. This represents a substantial increase in our ability to assess gene transcription
patterns in salmonids. The hybridization performances of
the different salmonid species (assessed from numbers of
Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout elements passing
threshold) conformed to expectations, given the close

The relationships among the three subfamilies within Salmonidae have not been extensively addressed at the
molecular level. However, on the basis of a morphological
analysis, Coregoninae (whitefish and ciscos) has been
hypothesized as the earliest branch within the salmonids
[[29], also see [30]]. In the present analysis, 14 of the 25
informative gene sets are more consistent with the basal
position of Thymallinae (Figure 3). Of the discrepant
trees, 8 sets support a Thymallinae/Coregoninae grouping
and 3 support an ancestral position of Coregoninae.
While these data are not definitive, there appears to be
some support for an ancestral Thymallinae branching
within the Salmonidae with Coregoninae as the sister
group to Salmoninae. These data provide the first largescale molecular view of salmonid subfamily relationships
and provide an important perspective on future analyses
of duplicated genes, as well as physiological and ecological traits [27] that have evolved subsequent to the ancestral salmonid genome duplication.
The salmonid whole genome duplication hypothesis
makes it is difficult to separate an analysis of species relationships from gene phylogeny. One expectation arising
from a relatively recent genome duplication is evidence
for extensive nuclear gene duplicates. Subsequent to the
genome duplication, the number of observed duplicated
transcribed genes is expected to decrease as, over time, one
of the duplicates becomes transcriptionally inactive.

opportunity to evaluate gene expression patterns of a large
group of culturally and economically important species.

Conclusion
Atlantic salmon and rainbow trout now rank 19th and 29th
in terms of species representation in EST databases with
over 730,000 salmonid ESTs in total. Almost half of these
data are presented in this study. These data provide an
excellent genetic resource for physiological, ecological,
biochemical, behavioral, disease and biological studies of
salmonids. They also provide key materials for the development of polymorphic markers for genetic and physical
genomics maps, for the identification and analysis of proteins and for the development of microarrays and primers
for transcriptional analyses.

Transcript assemblies and analyses have identified over
81,000 possible transcripts from Atlantic salmon and
51,000 transcripts from rainbow trout. These assemblies
and consensus sequences are available from the author or
through a database housed on the GRASP website [24]. As
many as 17,399 full-length Salmo salar gene assemblies
are present in this database.
Comparison of orthologous ESTs from Atlantic salmon,
rainbow trout, chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, brook
trout, lake whitefish, grayling, northern pike and rainbow
smelt show that Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus), Atlantic
salmon (Salmo salar) and brook trout (Salvelinus fontinalus) average 94–96% similarity. Lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and grayling (Thymallus thymallus) are
more distant from Pacific and Atlantic salmon (92%), followed by northern pike (Esox; 89%) and rainbow smelt
(Osmerus; 86%). A view of salmonid relationships and
support for the salmonid genome duplication has been
found. With the new EST database, a new, more extensive
32 K cDNA microarray has been developed to help assess
gene expression patterns in salmonids.

Methods
Tissues, RNA, Aquaculture and Sampling
Salmo salar (McConnell strain), Oncorhynchus tshawytscha
and Oncorhynchus nerka tissues were obtained from the
Department of Fisheries and Oceans (Robert Devlin,
WestVan Lab., West Vancouver, British Columbia). Salvelinus fontinalis and Coregonus clupeaformis tissues were
obtained from Louis Bernatchez (Laval University, Quebec). S. salar (Saint John River strain; brain, kidney and
spleen) were obtained from Vanya Ewart (NRC Institute
for Marine Biosciences, Nova Scotia). Thymallus thymallus
brain, kidney and spleen tissues were obtained from Craig
Primmer (University of Turku, Finland). Esox lucius were
captured by gill net from Charlie Lake British Columbia.
All fish were euthanized, followed by rapid dissection of
tissues. Tissues were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen or dry
ice and stored at -80°C until RNA extraction.
cDNA libraries
Total RNA or poly(A)+ RNA (FastTrack MAG kit; Invitrogen) was extracted from flash frozen tissues. Salmo salar
and Oncorhynchus tshawytshca mixed tissue (spleen, head
kidney, brain) libraries were directionally constructed in
both pCMV Sport-6.1 (Research Genetics Inc.) and pAL17.3 (Evrogen Co.). S. salar (normalized head kidney, thymus and thyroid), Coregonus clupeaformis. Thymallus thymallus and Salvelinus fontinalis libraries were constructed
in pAL-17.3 (Evrogen). The Oncorhynchus nerka mixed tissue normalized library was also constructed in pCMV
Sport-6.1 (ResGen). S. salar (mixed tissue St. John strain)
and Esox lucius libraries were constructed in pDNR-Lib
using Creator SMART cDNA library construction kits

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/545

(Clontech). Insert sizes of cDNA libraries were determined by visual comparison of clone restriction fragments with the DNA size markers HindIII (GibcoBRL) and
1 kb ladder (GibcoBRL).
Sequencing, Sequence Analysis, and Contig Assembly
Clone libraries were plated and robotically arrayed in
384-well plates. Glycerol stocks of overnight cultures were
prepared in 384-well format [19]. Plasmid DNAs were
extracted and BigDye™ Terminator (ABI) cycle sequenced
on ABI 3730 sequencers using conventional procedures
and the following primers: 5'-T18-3', M13 forward (5'GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3'),
M13
reverse
(5'AACAGCTATGACCAT-3' or 5'-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC3') and for the Evrogen libraries SP6WAN primer was used
for the 3' end sequencing. Base-calling from chromatogram traces was performed using Phred [32,33]. Vector,
poly-A tails, and low quality regions were trimmed from
EST sequences; sequences that had less than 100 good
quality bases after trimming were discarded [19]. Initial
assembly of ESTs into contigs used PHRAP [34], under
stringent clustering parameters (minimum score: 100;
repeat stringency: 0.99). Contig consensus sequences and
singleton sequences were aligned with non-redundant
GenBank nucleotide and amino acid sequence databases
(SwissProt, PBL, CDD, and UniRef90) using BLASTN or
BLASTX [35-37]. Sequence databases, assemblies, consensus sequences, tools such as BLAST and RepeatMasker
[38], and sequence and consensus annotations are freely
available from the author and from the GRASP website
[24].

The number of Salmo salar contigs was assessed using the
PHRAP assembly program because of its ability to assemble very large numbers of ESTs in a single run, and its integration with PHRED base quality scores on primary reads
and subsequent consensus sequences. The CAP3 assembler [39] was also used and similar results were obtained
for smaller datasets. For this study, contig assembly
employed a two-stage process. The first stage assembly
used parameters 100 minscore and 0.99 repeat stringency
to build contigs and consensus sequences that appeared
to separate alleles of many transcripts. The second stage
used the consensus sequences (with quality scores) from
the first stage and parameters 96% repeat frequency and
300 minscore to build contigs and consensus sequences
that appeared to combine some of the contigs that contained some base calling discrepancies, as well as what
appeared to be alleles or very recently duplicated genes.
Various parameters were tested and final parameters were
chosen to minimize the number of contigs, where the
number of contigs changed the least with respect to small
changes in parameter values, and where distinct contigs
appeared to have some biological significance (i.e., 99/
100 appeared to separate many alleles and 96/300 as a

second stage appeared to join some alleles and provided
values that separated a clear majority of orthologous salmonid gene comparisons). With both sets of parameters,
we were able to discriminate between similar sequences
from different salmonid species. Sequences in contigs
containing more than one polyA site were removed from
the assemblies as they may represent chimeric clones.
Assemblies provide rough estimates of transcripts. Several
algorithms have been examined and all have strengths
and weaknesses. Examples of other assemblies include
DFCI gene indexes [40,41] that estimate 83,554 TCs+singletons from 244,984 rainbow trout ESTs and 63,138 contigs from a partial 236,009 EST dataset from Atlantic
salmon (these assemblies are periodically updated). INRA
[21] using CAP3 estimates 56,392 transcripts (contigs +
singlets) from 326,719 rainbow trout ESTs and 45,349
contigs from a partial Atlantic salmon EST database. UniGene [42], from NCBI does not provide true assemblies
and may cluster duplicated genes into single bins, which
is problematic in salmonids. UniGene estimates approximately 30,000 and 25,000 UniGene sets in Atlantic
salmon and rainbow trout respectively. While differences
exist, the general number of estimated transcripts is similar. Problem areas that have been identified in assemblies
tend to be associated with long transcripts, so these contigs will have to be treated carefully and perhaps manually
edited. Assemblies are freely available from the author
and the GRASP website [24]. As a caveat, because of the
purported recent duplication of the salmonid genome
and potential for miss-assembly of duplicated transcripts,
these contigs have to be treated with caution.
Percent identity measures between contig consensus
sequences from the various species were obtained from
BLASTN alignments where a minimum length of 200 bp
was observed. As in other distance measures, this finds the
most similar sequence fragments and is biased high, particularly for more distant comparisons. A partial estimate
of the impact on more distantly related sequence comparisons is the increased number of contigs for which no
cross-species alignments were found and the reduction in
average length of alignments. These values are provided in
Table 3. However, the percent identity measure provides
an estimate of observed similarity that is useful for evaluating potential cross-species DNA hybridizations in
microarray experiments (see below).
Gene phylogenetic analysis
Contig sequences from Salmo salar (Atlantic salmon),
Oncorhynchus mykiss (rainbow trout), Osmerus mordax
(rainbow smelt), Coregonus clupeaformis (lake whitefish),
Salvelinus fontinalis (brook trout), and Thymallus thymallus
(grayling) [Table 2] were BLASTed against each other
(evalue < 1e-35, hits > 100bp) and the results used to gen-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/545

erate clusters of contigs. Bins of similar sequences, or clusters, were generated containing all contigs irrespective of
species origin that had alignments with greater than 75%
of the length of the shorter sequence and had greater than
70% identity in the overlapping regions (alignments consisted of ends-free alignment with scores of 2/-2/-5/-1 for
match/mismatch/open gaps/extend gaps [43]. After the
contigs had been grouped into clusters, the individual
clusters were then further selected to only contain contigs
that had mutually overlapping regions and all contig
members were trimmed to the largest common alignment
(same alignment parameters as above). A good alignment
was considered to be greater than or equal to 300 bp in
length with greater than 60% identity in the overlapping
region. At this point, clusters that did not contain at least
one sequence from each of the six target species were discarded. This resulted in a dataset of 78 clusters or gene
sets. All gaps (and their corresponding positions in other
sequences of the cluster) were removed, and the data
within each gene set were bootstrapped 500 times. The
PHYLIP package was used because it offers many different
analysis methods, is freely available and is commonly
used [44]. Distance matrices were computed for each
bootstrapped dataset within each cluster using the F84
model of nucleotide substitution and Gamma-distributed
rates of variation across sites with a coefficient of variation
of 0.5 [44]. Neighbor-joining trees were then computed
from each set of distance matrices and the set of resulting
bootstrapped trees was used to derive a 70%-majority
consensus tree [44]. The consensus trees were rooted with
Osmerus mordax, and simplified by iteratively collapsing
all pairs of leaf nodes having the same species and showing > = 98% similarity in the aligned portion of their
sequences. Independently, maximum likelihood trees
were generated for all 78 data sets using the default
options with the Phylip program dnaml (transition/transversion ratio of 2.0, empirical base frequencies, constant
rate variation among sites). A general evolutionary model
was used for the 78 data sets because each set potentially
consisted of a mixture of unidentified coding and noncoding data. All of the 78 ML trees were consistent with
their 70%-consensus bootstrapped Neighbor-joining
counterparts. EST accession numbers used to make contig
consensus sequences, alignments and the 70% consensus
trees are available [see Additional file 1] or online at the
GRASP website [24].
Microarray Clone selection
Starting from the existing GRASP 16 K cDNA microarray
[24], additional clones were selected for representation on
the following basis: a) the contig (Table 2) includes at
least one clone that is on hand; b) the contig is of high
quality with few conflicting positions, few singleton positions, no interior singleton positions (potential chimeric
sites) and there are at least two clones in the contig (from

Page 13 of 16

BMC Genomics 2008, 9:545

at least 2 plates, and preferably from at least 2 libraries);
c) if the contig is singleton then it must have a good BlastX
hit (e-value < 1e-8) or other indication of orientation (eg.
consistent poly(A) tail information); d) contig must have
< = 94% identity to another sequence on the chip (the
existing 16 K plus any new contig; not counting rainbow
trout orthologs); and e) no tRNA, ribosomal, or mitochondrial sequences. We chose clone representatives
within each contig based on: a) the reliability of the cDNA
library and sequence; b) high similarity to consensus of
contig (allow 20 bp at ends for poor trimming); c) reliable
sequence from the 3'-end of contig and correct (3' -> 5')
orientation; and d) ownership of clone.
Microarray fabrication
The initial clones were robotically rearrayed from daughter glycerol stock 384-well plates into 96-well plates prefilled with 8% glycerol in 2XYT + ampicillin with a
MicroGrid II-610 (Biorobotics, Cambridge, UK), incubated overnight at 37°C, and checked for uniform optical
density. Plasmid inserts were PCR-amplified in a MJ Tetrad PTC-205 thermocycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA)
by using 1.0 μL overnight culture, 0.3 μM M13/pUC forward primer (5'-CCCAGTCACGACGTTGTAAAACG-3'),
0.3 μM M13/pUC reverse primer (5'-AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGG-3'), 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM TrisHCl, 50 mM KCl, 200 μM dNTPs, 1U AmpliTaq (Roche
Diagnostics, NJ, USA), and nuclease-free H2O (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA) to 100 μL. PCR conditions were as follows: 2 min at 95°C denaturation; 35 cycles of 30 sec at
95°C, 45 sec at 59°C, and 4 min at 72°C; and 7 min at
72°C. Hotstar taq (Qiagen) was used to amplify additional inserts (clone set 2) with an initial denaturation of
15 mins. Amplicon specificity and yield was analyzed by
capillary electrophoresis using the HT DNA SE 30
LabChip on Caliper AMS 90 system (Zymark-Caliper Life
Sciences, MA, USA). PCR products were robotically
cleaned (Qiagen) and consolidated into 384-well plates,
lyophilized by speed-vac, and resuspended in 20 μL 3×
SSC plus 1.0 M betaine. All cDNAs (average printing concentration of 165 ng/ul [original inserts] and 100 ng/ul
[new inserts]) were printed as single spots on Erie Aminosilane slides (Erie, Portsmouth, N.H., USA) with a
Genetix QArraymax microarray printer (Genetix, New
Milton, Hampshire, UK) or MicroGridII-610 printer
(Biorobotics, Cambridge, UK). All clones and controls
were distributed randomly on the array. Genetix aQu 65
um quill pins or Biorobotics 10 k quill pins in a 48-pin
tool were used to deposit < 1.0 nL (0.1 ng cDNA) per spot
onto the slide. The resulting microarrays have a 4 × 12
subgrid layout with 699 spots per subgrid, each spot having diameter and pitch of 90–130 and 160–190 μm,
respectively. A 280-bp GFP (green fluorescent protein)
cDNA was amplified from a GFP clone (BD Biosciences,
Mountain View, CA, USA) by using the primers (5'-GAAA-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/545

CATTCTTGGACACAAATTGG-3') and (5'- GCAGCTGTTACAAACTCAAGAAGG-3'), and printed in subgrid corners
to assist in placing on the grid. The slides were crosslinked
in a UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA)
at 300 mJ. One slide every 20 to 30 slides was hybridized
with labeled random 9-mer oligonucleotide (SpotQC,
Integrated DNA Technologies, Coraville, IA, USA) and
scanned using GenePix 4200AL scanner (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Presence/absence, shape,
signal intensity vs. background, diameter and DNA binding site capability were measured for each spot on the
slide using files generated by Imagene software (BioDiscovery Inc., El Secundo, CA, USA). Position and description of flagged spots (spots absent or thought to be
unusable during post hybridization analysis), sub-grid
defects and other noticed irregularities are recorded. Two
PCR fragments from each plate were randomly selected
and sequenced to ensure correct matches to the original
clone sequence in the EST database. For controls, Stratagene SpotReport Alien cDNA Array Validation system PCR
products (Cat # 252550) composed of 10 unique PCR
products are spotted five times on the array. Corresponding mRNA for these PCR products can be purchased from
Stratagene. The alien mRNA spikes can be used to determine mRNA quality, cDNA synthesis efficiency, positive
and negative hybridization control, normalization for dye
differences and determination of hybridization consistency.
Microarray hybridizations
The microarray experiments were designed to comply
with MIAME guidelines. To minimize technical variability, all targets were synthesized in one round and hybridization experiments were conducted on slides from a
single batch. Each hybridization experiment included
dye-flips to compensate for cyanine fluor effects. Total
RNA samples were quantified and quality-checked by
spectrophotometer and agarose gel, respectively. All
hybridization experiments were performed using the
SuperScript III Indirect cDNA Labeling System kit and following manufacturers instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly,
total RNA was reverse transcribed using an anchored oligo
d(T)20 primer in cDNA synthesis reactions that incorporated aminoallyl- and aminohexyl-modified nucleotides.
The modified cDNAs were then labeled with fluorescent
Cy5 or Cy3 dye in reactions with the amino-functional
groups in coupling buffer.

All microarrays were prepared for hybridization by washing 2 × 5 min in 0.1% SDS, washing 5 × 1 min in MilliQ
H2O, and drying by centrifugation (520 g for 5 min in 50
ml conical tube). All slides were prehybridized in 5 × SSC,
0.1% SDS, 3% BSA for 1.5 h at 49°C. Arrays were briefly
washed 3 × 20 sec in MilliQ H2O, then dried by centrifugation. A total of 200 ng of labeled cDNA with each fluor

was applied to prewarmed microarrays in a formamidebased buffer (25% formamide, 4× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 2×
Denhardt's solution) 16 h at 49°C. The arrays were
washed 1 × 10 min at 49°C (2× SSC, 0.1% SDS), and then
2 × 5 min in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS, 2 × 5 min in 1× SSC and
4 × 5 min in 0.1× SSC at room temperature, then dried by
centrifugation.
Microarray analyses
Fluorescent images of hybridized arrays were acquired
immediately at 10 um resolution using ScanArray Express
scanner (PerkinElmer). The Cy3 and Cy5 cyanine fluors
were excited at 543 nm and 633 nm, respectively, at the
same laser power (90%), with adjusted photomultiplier
tube settings between slides to balance the Cy5 and Cy3
channels. Fluorescent intensity data was extracted from
TIFF images using Imagene 5.6.1 software (Biodiscovery).
Quality statistics were compiled in Excel from raw
Imagene fluorescence intensity report files. The hybridization performance of labeled targets to salmonid features
was assessed as a percentage of features bound from the
numbers of AS and RT features passing a hybridization
signal threshold. Signal threshold was defined by 2 standard deviations above the signal mean for the 3× SSC/
betaine buffer spots. Outliers of buffer spots were
removed based on the Median Absolute Deviation
method [45] whereby elements with a test statistic value
greater than 5 were removed. No transformations or normalizations were performed on these data. Only features
deemed present by Imagene 5.6.1 (excluding marginal
and absent values) were used for analyses.
