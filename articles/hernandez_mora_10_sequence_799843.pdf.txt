Sequence analysis of two alleles reveals that
intra-and intergenic recombination played
a role in the evolution of the radish fertility
restorer (Rfo)
José R Hernandez Mora1, Eric Rivals2, Hakim Mireau1, Françoise Budar1*

Abstract
Background: Land plant genomes contain multiple members of a eukaryote-specific gene family encoding
proteins with pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) motifs. Some PPR proteins were shown to participate in posttranscriptional events involved in organellar gene expression, and this type of function is now thought to be their
main biological role. Among PPR genes, restorers of fertility (Rf) of cytoplasmic male sterility systems constitute a
peculiar subgroup that is thought to evolve in response to the presence of mitochondrial sterility-inducing genes.
Rf genes encoding PPR proteins are associated with very close relatives on complex loci.
Results: We sequenced a non-restoring allele (L7rfo) of the Rfo radish locus whose restoring allele (D81Rfo) was
previously described, and compared the two alleles and their PPR genes. We identified a ca 13 kb long fragment,
likely originating from another part of the radish genome, inserted into the L7rfo sequence. The L7rfo allele carries
two genes (PPR-1 and PPR-2) closely related to the three previously described PPR genes of the restorer D81Rfo
allele (PPR-A, PPR-B, and PPR-C). Our results indicate that alleles of the Rfo locus have experienced complex
evolutionary events, including recombination and insertion of extra-locus sequences, since they diverged. Our
analyses strongly suggest that present coding sequences of Rfo PPR genes result from intragenic recombination.
We found that the 10 C-terminal PPR repeats in Rfo PPR gene encoded proteins result from the tandem
duplication of a 5 PPR repeat block.
Conclusions: The Rfo locus appears to experience more complex evolution than its flanking sequences. The Rfo
locus and PPR genes therein are likely to evolve as a result of intergenic and intragenic recombination. It is
therefore not possible to determine which genes on the two alleles are direct orthologs. Our observations recall
some previously reported data on pathogen resistance complex loci.

Background
The analysis of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome
sequence led to the discovery of the Pentatricopeptide
Repeat (PPR) protein family, which has undergone a
spectacular expansion in land plants [1-3]. PPR proteins
are composed of tandem repeats of degenerate 35 amino
acid motifs. These reiterations are thought to constitute
protein-RNA interaction surfaces [3,4]. Most PPR proteins are predicted to be transported to mitochondria

and/or plastids [3], where they participate in various
mRNA maturation steps (reviewed in [5-7]). The PPR
protein family has been classified into two subfamilies.
The PPR-P subfamily contains proteins uniquely formed
of canonical (35 amino acid) PPR repeats, and its members were identified in plants and non-plant eukaryotes.
PPR-P proteins were shown to be involved in various
steps of mRNA expression like translation [8-10], intron
splicing [11-14], mRNA stabilization [9,15], and RNA
cleavage [13,16,17]. Proteins belonging to the PPR-PLS
subfamily are specific to land plants and carry, in a
defined order, repeats of slightly different sizes (called L
or S) in addition to the originally identified 35 amino

acid P motif. Most PLS proteins have conserved extensions at their C-terminal, such as E+ or DYW domains
which were linked to RNA editing and cleavage
[3,16,18-24]. Rivals et al proposed that evolution by internal duplication of blocks of PPR motifs explains the
structure of PPR proteins belonging to the plant combinatorial and modular (PCMP) sub-family [25].
Recently, a comparison between the complete set of
PPR proteins from three plant species indicated that
almost every Arabidopsis PPR gene has a single putative
ortholog in Oryza sativa (rice), showing that PPR proteins have a high degree of interspecies conservation
between monocots and dicots. The sequences of two
groups of PPR-P proteins could not be aligned between
Arabidopsis and rice and these genes represent distant
homologues of fertility restorers of cytoplasmic male
sterility identified in radish and rice [4]. Restorers of fertility (or Rf) are nuclear genes that prevent the action of
non-conserved and often chimeric mitochondrial genes
that cause cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS). CMS sterility-inducing genes and their corresponding Rf are the
genetic factors of the best theoretically analyzed genomic conflict in plants [26]. CMS systems have also been
widely used in the production of hybrid crops [27] and
as a model for studying nucleo-mitochondrial interactions [28]. Since the identification of the first Rf gene in
Petunia [29], Rf genes encoding PPR-P proteins were
identified in rice [30-32] and radish [33-35]. Interestingly, Rf genes are carried on complex loci, containing
several closely related genes, generally unable to restore
fertility. For example, the restoring allele of the radish
Rfo locus, here named D81Rfo, carries three related PPR
genes arbitrarily named PPR-A, PPR-B, and PPR-C
[33-35]. The PPR-B gene confers the fertility restoration
activity, whereas PPR-A and PPR-C do not [10,33-35].
PPR-C was shown to be a pseudogene [10]. Several
related PPR genes are also clustered on the rice genome
at the Rf-1 locus [31,36,37]. This led to the idea that Rf
genes, unlike other PPR genes, might undergo an evolutionary process recalling that of resistance genes in
plants [38]. Resistance genes are arranged in complex
clusters and are thought to evolve through a birth-anddeath mechanism [39,40].
By analyzing the rice Rf-1 locus in a large number of
Oryza lines from wild and cultivated species, Kato et al
showed that the ancestral Rf-1 gene likely underwent
duplication in an ancient progenitor of the Oryza species AA genome and that then intergenic homologous
recombination probably contributed to the diversification of alleles [36].
Geddy and Brown analyzed syntenic genomic regions
from Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica rapa or radish
and showed that the location and direction of PPR
genes are less conserved than those of non-PPR genes

of the same regions, and therefore qualified them as
“nomadic” [41]. They also suggested that interallelic
recombination could be the mechanism leading to the
observed variability in copy number and sequence
among PPR genes.
In this report, we describe the sequence and genetic
organization of a non-restoring allele of the Rfo locus
(L7rfo), isolated from a European radish cultivar that
was selected for the absence of restorers [42]. By comparing it with the previously described restorer allele
(D81Rfo), originating from an Asian genotype, some
interesting observations could be made which strongly
suggest that several mechanisms acted in the diversification of Rfo alleles. These include recombination and
insertion of sequences originating from other locations
in the radish genome. We describe two new PPR genes
that are closely related to PPR-A, PPR-B, and PPR-C
and investigate their phylogenetic relationship. Our
results reveal that these five related PPR genes share a
common sequence organization, probably present in
their common ancestor. We report evidence that some
of these genes originate from intragenic recombination.
We also identify an internal duplication of a sequence
fragment encoding 5 PPR repeats in the 3’ end of the
genes.

Results
Cloning and sequencing of a non-restoring allele of
the Rfo locus from a European radish

In order to obtain the complete sequence of a nonrestorer (also named maintainer) allele (L7rfo) for the
Rfo locus, we constructed a BAC library from the L7
radish line, which was selected from European radish
cultivars for maintaining Ogura sterility [42]. Genomic
clones carrying the L7rfo allele were selected using two
PCR markers closely linked to the Rfo locus and previously identified during identification of the restorer
allele (D81Rfo)[34]. These markers amplify parts of
genes flanking the PPR genes of the Rfo locus (see
Methods section for details). A single clone containing
both markers was selected and completely sequenced.
The sequence of the corresponding 41,492 bp DNA
insert was deposited in Genbank (accession number
FN397617). Thereafter, this sequence will be named
L7rfo, whereas the previously described sequence of the
restorer genotype derived from an Asian cultivar will be
designated D81Rfo (accession number AJ550021). Rfo
will be used to designate the locus or to make general
statements applying to both alleles.
The L7rfo locus carries two PPR genes and is not
entirely collinear with Rfo

The L7rfo and D81Rfo sequences were compared by
local pairwise alignment using the YASS program [43].

Hernandez Mora et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:35

The sequence available for D81Rfo is longer than the
L7rfo sequence and extends on both sides of it, thus we
only analyzed the DNA regions for which sequence
information was available for both genotypes. Genes
were predicted using GENSCAN [44]. The Arabidopsis
thaliana protein database was screened with the peptide
sequences of the predicted gene products using the
BLASTP program [45] and predicted genes that do not
have a homolog in Arabidopsis were disregarded.
The results are summarized in Figure 1 and Table 1.
Comparison of both sequences shows that three classes
of regions can be distinguished. Firstly, two highly similar regions (92% to 97% identity) of 18,350 bp and
22,166 bp, and 3,164 bp and 1,976 bp in L7rfo and
D81Rfo respectively, were detected by YASS with an Evalue threshold of 10-10. They are collinear except for
one duplication that is present in the disease resistance
gene carried by the D81Rfo sequence but not in that
carried by L7rfo. These two regions include the PCR
markers used to screen the BAC library and homologues
of the genes from the corresponding syntenic region of
Arabidopsis chromosome 1 (Table 1). Secondly, two
regions of L7rfo showed 90 to 94% identity with the
region of D81Rfo carrying the PPR genes and two PPR
genes, named PPR-1 and PPR-2, were predicted. Lastly,
a large central region in L7rfo (13,722 bp) and a small
region upstream of PPR-1 (1,163 bp) showed no clear
similarity with the D81Rfo sequence. In addition, a
small region in D81Rfo (1,936 bp) upstream of PPR-C,
and two regions located between adjacent PPR genes
share no homology with the L7rfo sequence. Pairwise
comparisons using different E-value thresholds for YASS
or the BLASTN program gave similar results, except
that the lengths of the different types of regions were
slightly different.
RT-PCR analyses indicated that both PPR-1 and PPR-2
are transcribed, at least in flower buds, and sequencing
of amplification products confirmed the presence of an
intron in their 3’ regions, as in PPR-B and PPR-A (Figure 2, additional File 1). Like the D81Rfo PPR genes,
PPR-1 and PPR-2 are predicted to encode proteins containing 17 PPR-P repeats. Interestingly, the putative
PPR-1 and PPR-2 proteins contain the same four amino
acid deletion in the third PPR repeat also found in PPRA [34]. PredOtar [46] and TargetP [47] subcellular targeting prediction programs both predicted that the
putative PPR-1 and PPR-2 proteins are transported to
mitochondria (data not shown).
Analysis of phylogenetic relationships between
PPR genes of the Rfo locus

We compared the sequences of the putative PPR-1 and
PPR-2 proteins with PPR-A and PPR-B; PPR-C was not
included in this analysis because it is a pseudogene [10].

Page 3 of 15

The alignment indicates that all four proteins are closely
related and likely arose from a common ancestor,
although only PPR-B possesses a complete third PPR
motif (Figure 3). The percentage of identity between the
PPR protein sequences encoded by the Rfo locus, is
above 84%, which precludes phylogenetic analyses on
peptide sequences. Therefore, in order to infer the phylogenetic relationship of the PPR genes present at the
Rfo locus, we carried out multiple global alignments of
their coding sequences. This meant that the PPR-C
pseudogene could also be included (Additional File 1).
A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was constructed with PHYML from the MUSCLE alignment
obtained with the five sequences plus the sequence of
the closely related rapeseed gene PPRB-LIKE1 as the
outgroup [10] (accession number FJ455099) (Figure 4).
The resulting tree showed that, although the PPR-1
and PPR-2 genes are from a European radish cultivar,
they group with PPR-A and PPR-C, respectively, which
were sequenced from an Asian radish genotype. This
result suggests that a PPR gene duplication at the Rfo
locus predates the divergence of Asian and European
genotypes, and that PPR-1 and PPR-A, on one hand,
and PPR-2 and PPR-C, on the other hand, probably
derived from two distinct copies of the Rfo PPR gene in
the common ancestor of these two geographically isolated radish genotypes.
Intragenic recombination appears to have occurred
during the evolution of Rfo PPR genes

The respective positions of the L7rfo and D81Rfo PPR
genes on either allele are not in good agreement with
the phylogenetic analysis (see Figure 1 and Figure 4).
This observation suggests that sequence rearrangements
occurred during allele differentiation at the Rfo locus.
This led us to carry out a pairwise alignment of the
L7rfo PPR genes, including 1 kb of flanking sequence,
versus the three D81Rfo genes and their flanking
sequences (Figure 5). The results showed that short
fragments of ca 150 bp of the upstream regions flanking
PPR-1, PPR-2, PPR-B and PPR-C are similar, whereas no
similarities were found between downstream sequences,
except between PPR-1 and PPR-B, and PPR-2 and PPRA. Interestingly, the multiple gene alignment clearly
showed that the 3’ sections of the PPR-1 and PPR-B
genes, including the introns, are shared. A similar observation was also made for PPR-2 and PPR-A (Additional
File 1).
We therefore analyzed the similarities within the gene
coding regions of PPR-1 and PPR-2 and their relatives
on the D81Rfo allele in further detail. A multiple alignment of gene sequences (Additional File 1) revealed
polymorphisms shared between PPR-1 or PPR-2 and the
genes from the D81Rfo sequence (Figure 4). We

considered that a polymorphism was shared between
two sequences when the nucleotide at this position was
identical between the two considered sequences and different from that present at the same position in the
three other genes (regions with gaps were not considered). For each gene, we observed that polymorphisms
shared with a gene of the D81Rfo allele were grouped
together rather than being spread along the sequence. It

was particularly obvious for polymorphisms shared
between the ends of PPR-1 and PPR-B, the first halves
of PPR-2 and PPR-C, and the ends of PPR-2 and PPR-A
(Figure 6). This analysis suggests that different parts of
PPR-1 and PPR-2 share a most recent common ancestor
with different genes of the D81Rfo allele, which implies
that intragenic recombination occurred during gene
evolution.

Material and Methods). Reliability for internal branches was assessed using the bootstrapping method (500 bootstrap replicates). Bootstrap results
are indicated in red. Graphical representation and editing of the tree were performed with TreeDyn (v198.3) [70].

We identified possible recombination points in the
two genes by using the RAT program [48], which was
designed to infer recombination points by detecting
abrupt changes in the similarity profile of a target
sequence (Figure 7). Analysis of the PPR-1 coding
sequence revealed putative recombination points
between positions 125 and 175, positions 675 and 725,

with PPR-A as the closest relative between these two
points, and positions 1875 and 1925. Analysis of the
PPR-2 coding sequence revealed putative recombination
points in the following regions: [25,75], [675, 725], with
PPR-C as the closest relative between this two points,
[875, 925] and [1875, 1925]. These results support our
conclusion that intragenic recombination appears to

have occurred among PPR genes of the Rfo locus during
evolution.
The sequence of PPR genes from the Rfo locus results
from internal duplication of PPR repeat coding regions

In a recent report, the PCMP (PLS) sub-family of PPR
genes was proposed to have arisen via duplication of
PPR motif coding regions [25]. We took advantage of
the availability of sequences of five highly related genes
to test whether information regarding the structure of
their common ancestor could be obtained by comparing
their PPR repeat coding regions. We carried out multiple alignments with the PPR motif coding sequences
from the 5 PPR genes from L7rfo and D81Rfo using
MUSCLE. Each sequence used was identified according
to its gene of origin (PPR-1, PPR-2, PPR-A, PPR-B, PPRC) and the position of the repeat in the protein (01 to
17). For this purpose, only coding sequences were considered and the intron in repeat 17 was removed.
A phylogenetic tree was constructed with PHYML using
the GTR model (Figure 8). Each PPR motif coding
sequence was found to be associated with coding
sequences of the corresponding repeats in the 4 other
genes. This shows that the structure is conserved among
the 5 genes. It suggests that the general motif structure
of the common ancestor of the five genes was most
probably the same. In addition, the coding sequences of
repeats 8 and 13, 9 and 14, 10 and 15, 11 and 16, and
12 and 17 appear more related to each other than with
any other PPR motif coding sequence. Furthermore,
their consecutive positions in the genes strongly suggest
that the sequence fragments encoding repeats 8, 9, 10,
11, and 12, and that encoding repeats 13, 14, 15, 16 and
17, result from a tandem duplication event.
It should be noted that when the same analysis was
carried out without removing the intron from the coding sequences of repeat 17, the results did not change
significantly (data not shown). Finally, when we included
repeat coding sequences from the B. napus related gene
PPR-B-LIKE1, we observed that each repeat of the rapeseed gene clustered with the corresponding repeats of
the radish genes, indicating that the gene structure was
conserved throughout speciation (Additional File 2).

Discussion
Here we describe the Rfo region from a non-restoring
(maintainer) genotype of radish (L7rfo) that was analyzed by comparison with the previously described
counterpart region from a restorer genotype (D81Rfo)
[33,34]. At least one Rfo-related gene has been reported
outside the Rfo locus in the restorer cultivar, (g1 in
[41]), thus it was important not to rely on PPR-gene
sequences to isolate the L7rfo allele. On the contrary,
we used PCR markers anchored in radish homologues

to At1 g63720 and At1 g63680 to isolate the RfoL7
allele, as did Desloire et al to isolate the D81 allele [34].
Homologs to At1g63770, At1 g63720, At1 g63730, and
At1 g63680 were identified on the L7rfo sequence, as on
D81Rfo. In addition, markers derived from At1 g63770,
At1g63720, At1 g63730, and At1g63680 gene sequences,
for which homologs were identified in L7rfo and
D81Rfo sequences, were used during the fine mapping
of the Rfo locus in the cross D81xL7 [34]. Therefore the
allelism of D81Rfo and L7rfo is not doubtful. The two
currently available allele sequences originated from an
Asian (for D81Rfo) and a European (for L7rfo) genotype.
We previously reported that the Ogura CMS probably
followed different evolutionary pathways in Asian and
European lineages [49]. The two alleles compared here
might therefore diverge since quite a long time, but, in
any case, they are expected to be more closely related
than loci from related species, as the Rf-1 loci studied in
different rice genomes by Kato et al [36].
The first obvious finding from the D81Rfo vs L7rfo
comparison is that two PPR genes, separated by an
unrelated gene, are found on L7rfo, whereas D81Rfo
carries three PPR genes in tandem. Secondly, a global
alignment showed a break in colinearity between the
two sequences (Figure 1). The robustness of this observation to changes in the E-value threshold in the Yass
program led us to define the boundaries of the complex
Rfo locus as the colinearity break points, although the
exact position of these points obviously depends on the
alignment stringency. In addition, we detected sequences
on each allele with no homologous counterpart on the
other (white boxes in Figure 1). Although the lengths of
such “unique” sequences upstream PPR-1 and PPR-C
may be reduced with a less stringent E-value threshold,
there is no doubt that a large region between PPR-1 and
PPR-2 in L7rfo is absent in D81Rfo. Furthermore, the
predicted gene in this region (L7rfog5) is homologous to
the Arabidopsis MOS2 gene, which is involved in plant
innate immunity [50]. The Arabidopsis genome contains
two similar MOS2 genes, At1 g33520 and At4 g25020,
the former being the closest homologue to L7rfog5, but
none is located in the Arabidopsis genomic region syntenic to the Rfo locus [34] (Table 1). Therefore, this central region in the L7rfo allele is unlikely to originate
from a location close to the Rfo complex locus and
probably results from an insertion in the L7rfo allele
rather than a deletion in D81Rfo. This insertion could
have resulted from illegitimate recombination occurring
in intergenic regions between non allelic sequences,
thus we searched for repeated sequences that could be
involved in this type of mechanism. Among others, we
found a short (35 nt) direct repeat sequence immediately upstream of the PPR-2 gene, and an imperfect
indirect repeat sequence approximately 600 bp upstream

Page 10 of 15

of the L7rfog5 gene (data not shown). Nevertheless, it is
difficult to determine if and how these repeats were
involved in the mechanism. To date, no such insertions
inside a complex Rf locus were reported, however the
previous comparisons of complex Rf loci would probably
not have detected such insertions. In particular, the
comparison of rice Rf-1 alleles was conducted by PCR
analysis [36], and it is possible that in some cases the
Rf-1 allele could not be entirely defined by PCR amplification because insertions from other regions of the genome could have separated the different PCR primer
binding sites. Analysis of complete allele sequences of
other Rf complex loci will determine whether foreign
sequences have also inserted in Rf-PPR clusters from
other species.
We focused our sequence analyses on the two PPR
genes carried by the L7rfo allele. The gene predictions
obtained from GENSCAN were not very accurate, so we
aligned the coding sequences of PPR-1 and PPR-2 with
those of the closely related genes from the D81Rfo
sequence. We detected RNAs corresponding to these
genes by RT-PCR (Figure 2), indicating they are
expressed, at least at the RNA level. An antibody raised
against the PPR-B protein did recognize proteins of the
expected size in extracts from the L7 genotype [10].
Thus, at least some of these detected proteins could be
products of the PPR-1 and PPR-2 genes, although some
could also be proteins encoded by related genes located
outside the L7rfo allele. By sequencing RT-PCR products we determined the precise position and length of
the intron in the PPR-1 and PPR-2 genes, and also confirmed those of PPR-A and PPR-B (additional File 1).
The predicted protein sequences of the four genes are
remarkably similar, sharing 84.4% to 89% identity (Figure 3). The analyzis of the phylogenetic relationships
between the PPR genes of the Rfo locus (Figure.4) indicated that the genes of each allele do not derive from
recent duplications independently in the European and
Asian lineages. Therefore, a duplication of an Rfo-PPR
gene probably occurred in the common ancestor of the
Asian and European radish genotypes. The genes found
on different alleles of the rice Rf-1 locus were also proposed to derive from ancient duplications [36]. However, there are striking differences between the findings
reported regarding the comparison of rice Rf-1 regions
and our comparison of radish Rfo alleles. Kato et al. [36]
reported that flanking sequences specific to each Rf-1
gene as well as the gene order between clusters from
different species were conserved. Here we observed
almost no conservation of flanking sequences between
the Rfo-PPR genes, although we compared two genotypes of the same species (Figure 5). In addition, the
order of the genes relatively to the locus flanking
sequences is not consistent with their phylogenetic

Hernandez Mora et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:35
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/35

relationships inferred from the multiple alignment (Figure 1 &4). It cannot be ruled out that the PCR-based
approach used to analyze diversity among the rice Rf-1
restricted observations to situations where the gene
order was conserved. Nevertheless, the extremely
reduced conservation of PPR-gene flanking sequences
between the radish genotypes compared with the long
stretches of conserved PPR-gene flanking sequences
between rice species strongly suggests that the evolution
of the radish Rfo locus was dramatically more dynamic
and complex than that of the rice Rf-1 locus. As a result,
it is not possible to assign orthologs for PPR-1 and PPR2 on D81Rfo. Variable numbers and complex phylogenetic relationships between resistance genes were also
described between alleles of the Mi-1 resistance gene
clusters in tomato [51] and of the RPP5 locus in Arabidopsis [52]. Such observations likely result from interallelic recombination events.
Interallelic recombination can also lead to intragenic
sequence exchanges that may also affect the structure of
the genes by modifying the number of repeated
domains, as reported for some disease resistance genes
[52,53]. The petunia rf-PPR592 gene, sequenced from a
maintainer genotype, was reported to probably result
from intragenic recombination between closely related
PPR genes [29]. The distribution of polymorphisms in
the coding sequences of PPR-1 and PPR-2 appears to
reveal that intragenic recombination also occurred at
the Rfo locus (Figure 6). On the other hand, the 17 PPR
repeat structure shared by Rfo-PPR genes seems to be
remarkably stable (Figure 8). By adding the coding
sequences of repeats from the related rapeseed gene to
the analysis, we could show that this 17 repeat structure
probably predates the divergence of the two species
(Additional File 2). Interestingly, the Ogura CMS system
does not exist in any other species than wild and cultivated radishes (H. Yamagishi, personal communication).
Therefore, the Ogura restoring function of PPR-B was
selected in the radish lineage probably by duplication
and neofunctionalization of a previously existing PPR
gene, with a 17 repeat structure. It would therefore be
particularly interesting to investigate what was the biological function of the PPR-B ancestor gene in a species
were no Ogura CMS gene operated.
An intriguing question regarding the PPR-B third PPR
motif also arises. Among all the PPR genes described at
the Rfo locus, only PPR-B carries a complete third PPR
repeat coding sequence. PCR experiments specific for
the PPR-B third PPR motif were unsuccessful with all
the rapeseed genomic DNA tested (our unpublished
results). All the PPR-B related genes with an incomplete
third PPR motif carry the same deletion, so it is very
unlikely that this deletion occurred independently in different gene lineages. An ancestral gene carrying a

Page 11 of 15

complete third PPR motif might have existed at the
basis of the lineage of all PPR genes related to PPR-B,
and the deletion in the third PPR motif might have
occurred early in this lineage, the rapeseed genome
retaining only genes with the deletion.
An internal duplication, as those hypothesized in the
evolution of some resistance genes [52,53], seems to be
involved in the formation of Rfo-PPR genes. The results
of our phylogenetic analysis strongly suggest that the 10
C-terminal repeats of these genes result from tandem
duplication of a five repeat block. This raises a question
concerning the intron, located in the 3’ part of the coding region of the 17th repeat. The absence of intron in
the 12th repeat suggests that either the intron was lost
after the duplication of the repeat, or that the intron
was inserted at the end of the 17th repeat at a later
stage, after the gene structure had been established.
Rf-PPR genes were proposed to have evolved through
a process similar to that of disease resistance genes
[38,39]. The selective pressure involved is the need for
the nuclear genome to repress male sterility-inducing
genes appearing in the mitochondrial genome, in order
to restore their transmission to progeny via pollen.
Although few Rf-PPR genes have been identified so far,
several features of their sequences and genomic organization emerge and appear to reinforce this idea. Among
these features is the complex organization of Rf loci,
with the presence of PPR-genes closely related to
restorers of fertility, but unable to restore fertility. The
variable number of closely related PPR genes at Rf loci,
probably as a result of interallelic recombination and
unequal cross over events is also considered as a signature of the birth-and-death evolutionary process proposed for resistance genes.
The data provided by this study completes the overall
view obtained from previous analyses of different Rf loci.
These findings confirm that a variation in the number of
related PPR genes present on different alleles is a shared
feature of Rf loci. Our results also suggest that the evolution of Rf alleles has involved insertion of unrelated
sequences, a process that has not been previously
reported, and intragenic recombination, a mechanism
thought to contribute to diversification of disease resistance genes [39].

Conclusions
By thoroughly analyzing the sequences of two divergent
alleles of the radish Rfo restorer locus, we obtained new
insight into the evolutionary peculiarities of Rf loci and
Rf-PPR genes. Our results suggest that alleles at the Rfo
locus evolved through recombination, as well as insertion of “nomadic” sequences. In particular, we provide
evidence that PPR genes of the Rfo locus experienced
intragenic recombination during their evolution.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/35

Although Rfo-PPR genes are very prone to recombination, their structure, which is composed of 17 PPR motif
repeats, seems to remain unchanged and probably arose
in an ancestor species of rapeseed and radish by duplication of a block of 5 repeats at the C-terminal end of
the protein.

Methods
BAC library construction and identification of the clone
carrying the rfo allele

A BAC library was constructed from the radish L7 line
following the method described by Peterson et al [54].
The L7 line is a European radish line selected for the
absence of restorers [42]. Nuclei were extracted from
young leaves after 2 days in the dark and included in
agarose plugs. After partial digestion with HindIII, fragments between 40 and 100 kb were eluted from a pulsefield agarose gel and ligated into the HindIII cloningready pIndigoBAC-5 vector (Epicentre Biotechnologies)
and transformed into ElectroMAX DH10B electro-competent E. coli cells (Invitrogen). The resulting library
comprised ca 23,000 BAC clones. The library was amplified in 32 pools and each pool was screened with
F24D7-9rad and F24D7-13rad PCR markers (Tables 2
and 3). One pool was positive for both markers. 2688
colonies from this master pool were then further
screened and one clone positive with both primer pairs
was selected for sequencing. The selected BAC clone
was sequenced by the Centre National de Séquençage
(Evry). The sequence was named L7rfo and deposited in
the EMBL nucleotide sequence database under the
accession number FN397617.
Expression analyses

Total RNA and genomic DNA were extracted from
buds of two radish genotypes, L7 and D81, carrying the
maintainer (L7rfo) and restorer (D81Rfo) alleles of the
locus, respectively. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA was extracted
as previously described [55].

Total RNAs were treated with RNAse free-DNAse
(Fermentas) in the supplied buffer, at 37°C for 90 min.
DNAse treatment was stopped by adding 2.5 mM
EDTA (final concentration) and incubating at 65°C for
10 min. DNAse treated RNAs were then extracted with
phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25/24/1) and precipitated. The pellet was dissolved in 25 μL of water with
1 μg of dT18 for cDNA priming. The mix was heated to
65°C and cooled on ice. cDNA synthesis mix was then
prepared as recommended by Fermentas and separated
into two 19 μL aliquots just before adding the reverse
transcriptase. In one aliquot reverse transcriptase was
omitted (RT-control), in the other 1 μL (200U) of Fermentas Revert Aid H-M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase
was added (RT+ sample). Both were then incubated at
42°C for 90 min, and PCR amplifications were performed directly using one μL from each tube.
PCR amplification was conducted in 25 μL reaction
volumes for 35 cycles. Annealing temperatures and
extension times were adapted to each primer pair used
(see Tables 2 and 3).
For sequencing of RT-PCR products, two independent
PRC reactions were mixed in order to dilute out any
mistakes introduced by the Taq polymerase, and sent to
Genoscreen for sequencing with the upper PCR primer.
Sequences were aligned with the genomic sequence to
precisely locate intron limits.
Definition of gene sequences and PPR repeat sequences

Genes on the L7rfo sequence were predicted by GENSCAN [56,57]. PPR genes were then defined more precisely by aligning their coding sequences with those of
the PPR-genes of the Rfo allele. Accordingly, the prediction for PPR-2 was corrected and extra 5’ predicted
exons were discarded. The peptide sequences of nonPPR predicted gene products were then compared to
the Arabidopsis thaliana protein database using the
BLASTP program [45] and predicted genes with no Arabidopsis homologue were disregarded.

Subcellular location of the PPR-gene products was predicted using PredOtar v1.03 [46,60], and TargetP v1.1
[47,61].
Pairwise sequence comparisons were carried out using
YASS at [43,62] with default settings, except when mentioned in the text or figure legend.
Multiple sequence comparisons were carried out on
the platform at [63,64]. Alignments were carried out
using MUSCLE (v3.7) [65] using default settings. After
alignment, ambiguous regions (i.e. containing gaps and/
or poorly aligned) were removed with Gblocks (v0.91b)
[66]. The phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the
maximum likelihood method implemented in the
PhyML program (v3.0aLRT) [67,68].
Intragenic recombination was analyzed using the RAT
program [48] using a window size of 100 nt by increments of 50 nt, and minimum and maximum cut-off
scores of 87% and 96%, respectively.
