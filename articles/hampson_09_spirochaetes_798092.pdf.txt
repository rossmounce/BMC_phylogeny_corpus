Abstract
Anaerobic spirochaetes of the genus Brachyspira have long been known as important gut pathogens
of pigs, but increasingly they are recognised as causing disease in birds and other animal species,
including human beings. The genome sequence of the major swine pathogen Brachyspira
hyodysenteriae was recently published, and this revealed extensive genome optimisation that leads
to adaptation to the complex environment of the colon. The genome sequences of other
pathogenic and non-pathogenic Brachyspira species are becoming available, and this data will help
to reveal how these species have evolved and adapted to varied lifestyles in the large intestines of
different species, and why some but not others can induce colitis and diarrhoea.

Introduction
Spirochaetes form a distinct monophyletic phylum of
bacteria, and contain four genera that contain important
pathogenic species, these being Treponema, Borrelia, Leptospira and Brachyspira. Veterinary microbiologists and clinicians have long recognised the "intestinal spirochaetes"
of the genus Brachyspira as being important gut pathogens.
The best-known species is Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, the
agent of swine dysentery, which induces an extensive and
severe mucohaemorrhagic colitis in growing pigs [1].
There are six other named Brachyspira species, with several
more species having been unofficially proposed. Of these,
Brachyspira pilosicoli in particular is now recognised as an
important cause of colitis or typhlitis in both pigs and
poultry, and it has been suggested that strains of this species are potentially zoonotic [2]. By using appropriate
anaerobic culture conditions and/or polymerase chain
reaction amplification, these fastidious spirochaetes can
be identified in samples from many humans living in

crowded or unhygienic conditions in developing countries [3,4]. Recently, the pathogenic potential of B. pilosicoli has been emphasised by its identification in the stools
of more than one third of cholera patients in Bangladesh,
at densities equal to those of Vibrio cholerae [5]. Further
work is now underway to determine how this spirochaete
attaches to colonic enterocytes and induces disease in
humans and animals. The first genome sequence of a
Brachyspira species has provided unprecedented insights
into the biology and lifestyle of these pathogens and has
opened up a host of new possibilities towards their management in the human and veterinary healthcare arena.

The genome sequence of B. hyodysenteriae –
novel insights
Recently the genome of a Brachyspira species was
sequenced and analysed [6]. In this study B. hyodysenteriae
strain WA1 was sequenced and subjected to comparative
genomic analysis, with a view to improving understandPage 1 of 3

ing of how this branch of spirochaete life has adapted to
take up residence in the porcine colon, and how it is able
to induce such a severe disease in pigs. Surprisingly, of the
predicted 2,122 proteins encoded by the genome of
approximately 3 Mb, more had similarities to proteins
from enteric Escherichia coli and Clostridium species than
they did to proteins of other sequenced spirochaete species. Many of these genes were involved in transport and
metabolism functions, which undoubtedly are very
important for survival in the dense, complex and changing nutritional and polymicrobial environment of the
porcine large intestine. With time, these genes presumably
have been acquired by B. hyodysenteriae from the other
enteric species by horizontal gene transfer, gradually
increasing the fitness of the spirochaete to survival in the
colonic environment. Why this species preferentially (but
not exclusively) colonises the colon of pigs remains unexplained. The very close 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities between the various Brachyspira species implies that
there has been relatively recent speciation in the genus,
but the extent to which new bacterial genes from other
enteric species have been incorporated pre- and post-speciation also remains unclear. Further insight into this
question will become available as the genome sequences
of the other Brachyspira species are obtained and subjected
to comparative genome analysis, and when further epidemiological studies have helped to reveal the full extent of
diversity in the genus.
The potential mechanisms by which B. hyodysenteriae may
have acquired or exchanged such a broad set of genes were
not identified. Two bacteriophage-like genes were present
in the genome, as was the full set of genes for the gene
transfer agent (GTA) VSH-1, a prophage-like element that
is in a state of permanent lysogeny, but is known to be
able to transfer random ~7.5 Kb fragments of DNA
between B. hyodysenteriae strains [7]. Other Brachyspira
species contain similar GTAs [8], but it is not known
whether these allow transfer of DNA across species barriers.
Another apparent adaptation of B. hyodysenteriae to a gut
lifestyle, that was noted, was the large number of its genes
that were associated with chemotaxis and motility. These
functions are clearly important in the colonisation process, as, in order to induce disease, the highly motile spirochaete colonises colonic crypts and enters goblet cells,
from which it induces a characteristic outpouring of
mucus. Other potential virulence factors that were identified included genes predicted to encode 15 proteases and
six haemolysins, some of which may be involved in disruption and shedding of colonic enterocytes, exposing the
underlying lamina propria to polymicrobial invasion and
inflammation. The only genes identified for secretion
were those of the common secretory pathway, and no

http://www.gutpathogens.com/content/1/1/10

genes encoding known toxin-like proteins were identified.
The spirochaete had a full set of genes for lipooligosaccharide (LOS) biosynthesis, but these were not present in a
single locus, and surprisingly the rfb gene cluster was
present on a single ~36 Kb circular plasmid. Previously
LOS has been implicated as a potential virulence factor in
B. hyodysenteriae, inducing local inflammation in the
colon.

Application in vaccine development and
epidemiology
The availability of the genome sequence for B. hyodysenteriae has already opened the door for vaccine development;
for example, using the reverse vaccinology approach several potentially protective protein subunits have been
identified [9], and further advances in this area will occur
in future years. On another front, genome sequence data
make it possible to test evolutionary hypotheses based on
a core gene-pool. The phylogenetic relatedness of such
core genes could then be harnessed to analyse and dissect
larger collection of strains and field isolates by multilocus
sequence typing (MLST) or analysis of single nucleotide
polymorphisms. The genomic analysis of B. hyodysenteriae
has already provided the basis for development of a MLST
scheme for the spirochaete, which, by examining large
numbers of strains from different geographical origins, is
being used to help uncover the diversity and origins of
this pathogenic species [10].

Perspective
As more genomic data becomes available, and interest
increases in intestinal spirochaetes as potential pathogens
of humans and other species, this rather neglected field of
research is expected to catch up with mainstream infection
biology and ecology through the 'omic' platforms. Taking
lessons from the first B. hyodysenteriae genome, it will be
possible for the scientific community to embark upon
sequencing of many different human and animal derived
isolates of Brachyspira. This will not be a difficult task
given that newer sequencing platforms have drastically
reduced time and cost of whole genome sequencing.
Using comparative genomics, it will be possible to gauge
the extent of genomic diversity within the Brachyspira
genus, and the forces that regulate such diversity during
their colonisation of the gut and various niches thereof.
Also, it will be possible to know what survival advantages
are gained by Brachyspira species through lateral gene
transfer events that seemed to be a dominant evolutionary
force in several pathogens [11]. Consequently, functional
screens based on genes of especially non-spirochaete origin will be developed, thus leading to fresh insights into
adaptation mechanisms in an ecological and evolutionary
perspective. More efforts are therefore, clearly needed at
all fronts – from broad epidemiological studies of the various species to detailed functional genomics analysis.
