Abstract
Background: The homeodomain transcription factor Orthopedia (Otp) is essential in restricting
the fate of multiple classes of secreting neurons in the neuroendocrine hypothalamus of
vertebrates. However, there is little information on the intercellular factors that regulate Otp
expression during development.
Results: Here, we identified two otp orthologues in zebrafish (otp1 and otp2) and explored otp1
in the context of the morphogenetic pathways that specify neuroectodermal regions. During
forebrain development, otp1 is expressed in anterior groups of diencephalic cells, positioned in the
preoptic area (PO) (anterior alar plate) and the posterior tuberculum (PT) (posterior basal plate).
The latter structure is characterized by Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH)-positive cells, suggesting a role
for otp1 in the lineage restriction of catecholaminergic (CA) neurons. Disruptions of Hedgehog
(HH) and Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) pathways point to the ability of SHH protein to trigger
otp1 expression in PO presumptive neuroblasts, with the attenuating effect of Dzip1 and FGF8. In
addition, our data disclose otp1 as a determinant of CA neurons in the PT, where otp1 activity is
strictly dependent on Nodal signaling and it is not responsive to SHH and FGF.
Conclusion: In this study, we pinpoint the evolutionary importance of otp1 transcription factor in
cell states of the diencephalon anlage and early neuronal progenitors. Furthermore, our data
indicate that morphogenetic mechanisms differentially regulate otp1 expression in alar and basal
plates.

Background
The neurosecretory system controls a wide variety of
behavioural processes through synthesis and release of
different neurotransmitters in the peripheral and central
nervous systems [1,2]. One of the key integrating centers

of this organization is the hypothalamus, located in the
ventral sector of the diencephalon. However, insights in
the development of endocrine neurons has been gained in
the midbrain, due to implications with mental and neurological phenotypes that involve growth, reproduction and

general homeostasis, and have clinical relevance in degenerative and psychiatric disorders of embryonic origin (e.g.
Parkinson's disease and addiction) [3-8]. A wealth of
genetic data shows that the combinatorial codes of early
instructional cues from Hedgehog (HH), Fibroblast
Growth Factor (FGF), and Transforming Growth Factor
(TGF-β) extracellular signals mediate differentiation of
dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the midbrain [6,9-15].
Knowledge of the mechanisms of action connecting the
prosencephalic signaling pathways, the expression of specific transcription factors and the specification of neuronal individuality during the development of the
hypothalamus remains largely unclear [15].
Because of its central contribution to hypothalamic phenotypes during ontogenesis, the homeobox-containing
orthopedia (otp) gene may allow a meaningful understanding of signaling cascades [16,17]. Homologs of otp have
been identified in almost all Metazoa, pointing to a conservative and fundamental role in patterning and differentiation [18-28]. In mouse forebrain, Otp is expressed in
anterior and posteroventral hypothalamus, retrochiasmatic and supraoptic/paraventricular areas [18]. Otp
knock-out mice embryos fail to properly differentiate
anterior periventricular, paraventricular and supraoptic
nuclei, responsible for secretion of somatostatin, arginine
vasopressin, oxytocin, corticotropin-releasing hormone
and thyrotropin-releasing hormones [16,17]. In the diencephalon, Otp acts in parallel with the bHLH-PAS domain
factor Sim1 and its dimerizing partner ARNT2, and triggers expression of sim2 and brn2, a POU domain factor
[16,17,29-32]. It has been shown that otp is a direct target
of Brachyury and Spdeadringer transcription factors in
vertebrates and invertebrates [33,34]. Recently, several
transcription factors have been proposed as candidates for
upstream regulatory interactions with echinoderm otp
[35]. Some cases of holoprosencephaly, a congenital disorder with deficiencies in specific groups of CA neurons,
are characterized by disruption of sonic hedgehog (shh) and
secondary down-regulation of otp, brn2 and sim1, evoking
an interaction between otp and shh [36]. Despite all these
evidences, the mechanisms of regulation of the Otp gene
itself remain largely obscure.
We took advantage of the zebrafish to investigate the in
vivo functions of shh, fgf8, and ndr2 signaling pathways on
otp1 expression by means of morpholino-, mRNA- and
mutant-based methodologies. We provide evidence that
SHH regulates otp1 neuronal differentiation in the rostral
preoptic area (PO) (anterior alar diencephalon), through
the antagonistic interaction with FGF and Dzip1, a zincfinger/coiled-coil domain protein [37-40]. Moreover, we
also demonstrate that SHH- and FGF8-independent,
Ndr2-dependent transcription of otp1 in the posterior
tuberculum (PT) (posterior basal diencephalon) is neces-

sary to trigger CA neuronal fates. In evolutionary perspectives, functional association between otp1 gene expression
and patterning of the diencephalon embodies a primitive
condition in the rise of neuronal complexity of vertebrates.

Results
Isolation and structural analysis of the zebrafish
orthopedia genes
To isolate the zebrafish homologue of orthopedia (otp1), a
16–40 hour old zebrafish embryo cDNA library (kindly
provided by P. Chambon) was used for a PCR-based
screening with degenerate primers. Primers, named
ort1_fw (5'-CCNGCNCAGCTSAACGA-3'), and ort2_rv
(5'-CKYTTYTTCCAYTTNGC-3'), correspond to PAQLNE
and AKWKKR regions of the mouse Otp homeodomain,
respectively. Using a semi-nested PCR approach, we isolated a cDNA band of 150 base pairs (bp) encoding a partial homeodomain identical to the corresponding
residues in the mouse Otp protein. Gene- and vector-specific primers were used on the same library to isolate the
5' and 3' ends of the mRNA, allowing the identification of
a 1823 bp (poly(A) tail excluded) full-length otp1 cDNA
containing a 987 bp-long open reading frame (Fig. 1A).
The 5' UTR of the mRNA is 66-nucleotide (nt) long and
the first putative AUG codon is located between nt 67 and
69, suggesting the 67/69 AUG triplet as the initiation
codon. Therefore, the deduced protein encoded by otp1 is
328 amino acid (aa) long. The mRNA has a UAA stop
translation codon at nt 1051 and a 770 nt long 3' UTR
region, with one polyadenylation signal (AATAAA)
located between nucleotides 1807 and 1812.

During the same screening, a shorter otp1 transcript was
also identified that encodes a 315 aa long form of otp1.
The two transcripts differ for a 39-nt insertion at 5' end.
Interestingly, both human and mouse otp genes have an
intron at the same position of the zebrafish otp1 insertion,
suggesting that the two isoforms are generated by alternative splicing. Analysis of the zebrafish otp1 genomic region
flanking the insertion confirmed the presence of an intron
(located between nucleotides 142 and 143 of the longer
transcript) at the same position as in human and mouse
Otp genes (Fig. 1A). In zebrafish, an additional donor sites
generates a shorter mRNA form when a 39-nt fragment at
the 3' end of the first exon is spliced out together with the
downstream intron (Fig. 1B). RT-PCR experiments and a
cDNA library-based PCR screening confirmed the existence of two otp1 transcripts during embryo development
(Fig. 3). Genomic analysis of the zebrafish otp1 gene,
located bioinformatically on chromosome 15, has been
confirmed by PCR, revealing an organization similar to
mammalian otp homologs. The gene contains two introns
of 304 and 1144 bp, with the first one interrupting the N-

including presence and position of introns and the additional donor site (data not shown).
Molecular evolution of OTP proteins
Zebrafish Otp1 and Otp2 proteins clearly belong to the
Otp protein family of transcription factors, and they are
likely co-orthologs arisen from the ancient genome duplication event that occurred early in the phylogeny of rayfinned fish [42-45]. The identity of zebrafish Otp homeodomains with Mus musculus, Dugesia japonica and Drosophila melanogaster is 100%, 97% and 95%, while full
protein identity with mouse is 78% for Otp1 and 81% for
Otp2. In addition, they appear to share the Otp-specific
transactivating regions, as well as two additional domains
near the terminator codon [18] (Fig. 1A). The 13 aa stretch
resulting from alternative splicing (see above) of Otp proteins is characteristic of the fish lineage (see above). In
fact, mouse and human Otp genes lack the additional
donor site in the first intron responsible for the alternative
splicing of the long protein form. For this reason, the
short form of the zebrafish Otp proteins shows higher levels of similarity with mammalian homologs (data not
shown).

terminus of the protein, and the second one located at the
very end of the homeobox.
otp1 mRNA is characterized by an AU-rich element (ARE)
of ~150 nt in length, that lies within the 3' UTR and is
located ~200 bases downstream of the stop codon. This
ARE contains five copies of the AUUUA sequence, one of
which overlaps with the UUAUUUAUU nonamer, that
represent the minimal AU-rich motif that is able to destabilize and decay messengers [41].
In silico search of the zebrafish genome using otp1 cDNA
as bait provided a second otp gene, named otp2, located on
chromosome 2. otp2 ORF is 999 bp long, corresponding
to a putative protein of 332 aa. According to mRNA
sequences submitted to the NCBI database (accession nos.
XM_678094 and XM_701814), the otp2 RNA is alternatively spliced and encodes two discrete forms of mature
mRNA. Genomic organization of otp2 is identical to otp1,

For phylogenetic analysis, we used all available Otp protein and nucleotide sequences, including four ones that
were derived from EST and genomic sequence databases
(Hydra magnipapillata, Oryzias latipes, Takifugu rubripes and
Tetraodon nigroviridis). Otp protein alignment consisted of
591 characters, 408 of which were parsimony-informative. Zebrafish Otp sequences were easily aligned against
the rest of the data set mainly within the homeobox
domain, including small secondary regions of high similarity. Only these regions were used for the sequence analysis, while the most variable fragments were excluded. The
Maximum Parsimony (MP) phylogenetic reconstruction
(Fig. 2) resulted in 300 equally parsimonious trees (4458
steps of length; consistency index = 0.73; retention index
= 0.76). Maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses (data not shown), constrained with the
model of protein evolution that fits the data best, (JTT;
proportion of invariable sites; Gamma distribution, shape
parameter α = 2.318) [46] were topologically similar to
the MP tree. At any phylogenetic reconstruction, the
Antennapedia homeodomain region diverges greatly
from the other gene clusters, occupying a distinct basal
position. Otp, Otd and Otx gene families share an elevated sequence and structural homology in their homeodomain region. Within the Otp gene-family, two subclades are highly supported by all phylogenetic reconstruction methods: a vertebrate-specific Otp protein cluster, including fish paralogs, and one including Mollusca,
Echinoderma and Hemichordata orthologs. A third subclade consisting of D. japonica, D. melanogaster, H. magnipapillata, and Ciona intestinalis Otp gene sequences is not

robustly supported in any of the topologies (Fig. 2).
Finally, a Otd/Otx gene cluster, distantly related and basal
to the Otp gene family, was observed in all phylogenies
inferred.
Spatiotemporal expression of otp1 during embryogenesis
RT-PCR
We evaluated the presence of the two mRNA forms at different stages by means of RT-PCR using a pair of primers
spanning the cDNA region involved in alternative splicing. Both transcripts are already present at the oocyte
stage, proving the maternal origin of the transcript, and
remain detectable throughout the analyzed stages (Fig. 3).
We also report the expression of otp1 in the adult fish,
showing for the first time the activity of the gene in the
adult brain and in non-neuroectodermal territories (testis). The RT-PCR approach does not recognize trends or
relative differences between mRNA forms and developmental stages, supporting the view that splicing of otp1
RNA is not subject to strict regulatory mechanisms (Fig.
3).
Hindbrain
The spatial and temporal distribution of otp1 transcripts
was examined by whole mount in situ hybridization
(WISH) following standard protocols with digoxigenin
and fluorescein-UTP-labeled probes [47]. Although RTPCR revealed the presence of maternal and zygotic transcripts, first evidence of otp1 mRNA localization by WISH
appears in the forming hindbrain around the 3 somites
(s) stage, as a transverse stripe in the prospective
rhombencephalon (Fig. 4A). As shown by double labelling with krox20, otp1 expression at 12 s occurs in rhombomeres 3 (r3) and 5 (r5) (Fig. 4B). A histological cross
section at the level of the otic placodes shows that
rhombencephalic otp1 cells are located in the ventral alar

plate of the neural tube, within the mantler layer (Fig.
4C). As somitogenesis proceeds, otp1 expression extends
rostrally (Fig. 4D) and then caudally across the hindbrain
in the shape of segmentally iterated groups of cells (Fig.
4E). At 34 hours post fertilization (hpf), otp1 transcripts in
the hindbrain extend dorsally as parallel stripes in the
middle of each neuromeric segment (rhombomere), possibly acting as guidance cues for axonal elongation (Fig.
4H). This hypothesis is supported by spatial comparison
of otp1 mRNA with acetylated α-tubulin at 30 hpf, a
marker of reticulospinal neurons and corresponding
axons in the central part of every rhombomere [48] (Fig.
4F,G). At 48 hpf, otp1 expression in the hindbrain still persists in every rhombomere without further modifications
(data not shown).
Diencephalon
Soon after labelling in the hindbrain, a distinct cluster of
otp1 transcription appears at the rostral end of the neural
tube, in medial position with respect to the optic stalkspecific pax-2.1 positive cells [49] (Fig. 6A,B). Shortly
after, a novel diencephalic domain emerges posteriorly to
the previous one (Fig. 5A,B). The foremost, smaller group
is located at the boundary with the prospective telencephalon, while the posterior, larger one is observed more
laterally, below the optic recess (Fig. 5A,B). At 16.5 hpf,
otp1 expression in the hypothalamus has gained further
spatial complexity, as shown by the evidence of three
main clusters (Fig. 5C,D). The 16 s stage marks the onset
of ventral bending of the neural axis at the level of the
cephalic flexure, a major morphogenetic process that generates the displacement of forebrain territories at distinct
axial levels [50]. In this framework, a spatial rearrangement of the hypothalamic otp1 expression is observed.
Apparently, the medial cluster of otp1 expression is displaced dorsally and merges with the anterior one (com-

Zebrafish otp1 expression in the hindbrain. Anterior is left in all images except for C. All views are dorsal except for E, G
and H that are lateral. A, At 11 hpf stage, a narrow transverse stripe encompasses the neural tube in its anterior half. During
somitogenesis, a second narrow stripe appears more anteriorly (data not shown). B, Double labelling with otp1 (blue) and
krox20 (red) shows that otp1 expression in the hindbrain labels rhombomere 3 (r3) and 5 (r5) at 14 hpf stage. This developmental window coincides with the restriction of the two otp1 stripes toward the lateral margins of the neural tube, and with
the early extension of the signal throughout the rhombencephalon. C, Transverse section of a 24 hpf stage zebrafish embryo
through the hindbrain shows that these lateral clusters belong to the mantle layer of the ventral alar plate and are placed medially along the dorsoventral axis. D, Following (19 hpf), otp1 signals extend anteriorly, and then posteriorly, in the shape of
repeated patterns. E, 24 hpf embryo; otp1 mRNA signal localizes in restricted groups of cells, in a pattern reminiscent of rhombomere segmentation. F, G, otp1 WISH combined with acetylated α-tubulin (TU) immunochemical staining confirms that otp1
transcripts occur in paired clusters within each rhombomere (30 hpf) (open arrowheads in F indicate the axons in the central
part of every rhombomere). H, At 34 hpf, otp1 domains have elongated dorsally in parallel columns (vertical dashes in E, F and

expression in the hypothalamus is established as two
domains, one in the anterior alar plate, at the boundary
with the telencephalon (areas termed d1 and d2 [51]),

and one in the posterior basal plate of the hypothalamus,
in few cells of the posterior tuberculum (PT) extending
from the hairpin bend near the cephalic flexure (areas d5
and d6 [51]) (Fig. 5G,H). At 72 hpf, again three domains

4A), a small lateral domain appears at the anterior edge of the central nervous system (arrow) (see also Fig. 6A). Shortly after,
a novel center of transcription emerges posterolaterally in the alar plate (arrowhead). C, D, Then, otp1 expression diffuses
posteriorly in a segmented fashion with three clusters (1–3) (16.5 hpf). During this developmental phase, spatial rearrangements of the anterior forebrain start occurring as the result of the ventral bending of the neuraxis [50]. Even though intrinsic
topological changes in otp1 transcription may also happen, their extents are eventually obscured by morphogenetic dislocations
in the neural tube. E, F, At 19 hpf, otp1 positive cells in the middle of longitudinal domains displace dorsally with respect to cells
at different axial positions. Consequently, otp1 labelling in the anterior forebrain coalesces in the proximity of the optic recess

of otp1 mRNA distribution are detected in the ventral
diencephalon (Fig. 5I,J).
At 24 hpf, transversal histological sections show that the
anterior diencephalic domain belongs to the non-germinal (mantler) layer (data not shown). Coupling otp1
WISH with acetylated α-tubulin immunostaining, a
marker of major axonal traits in the embryonic CNS,
proves that the anterior otp1 cluster is enclosed in the preoptic area (PO) (alar plate) by the tracts of the anterior
and postoptic commissures, and it extends toward the
trait of the supraoptic commissure (Fig. 6C,D). Due to this
dorsal extension in the supraoptic region, we addressed
otp1 expression at the telencephalic-diencephalic boundary using masterblind (mbl) mutants. In mbl embryos, several forebrain defects are observed, such as absence of
optic vesicles, olfactory placodes, clusters of primary telencephalic neurons, anterior and postoptic commissures
[52-54]. Despite profound alterations in the telencephalic
structures, no significant changes are detected in the PO
cluster of otp1 expressing cells in comparison with wt
embryos at 20-s stage, suggesting that otp1 expression
does not occur in the telencephalon (Fig. 6E,F).
Combinatorial regulation of otp1 by Hedgehog, Fibroblast
Growth Factor and Nodal signaling
The cyclops (cyc) embryos carry mutations in the nodalrelated 2 (ndr2) gene that alter the development of ventral
CNS structures, with a severe phenotype in the rostral
brain [55-58]. Analysis of otp1 expression in 24 hpf cyc
embryos with intermediate phenotypes (reduction of the
ventral diencephalon and partial fusion of the eyes)
shows a reduced size and midline blending of the PO
domain. Interestingly, no otp1 expression occurs in the PT
of cyc embryos (Fig. 7A,B). To answer whether this result
is determined by impaired development of the otp1expressing cells or by absence of the prosencephalic ventral structures where the otp1-positive neurons normally
form, we microinjected ndr2 synthetic mRNA and analyzed the effects on the expression profile of otp1 in the PT
area (Fig. 7C–F). In accordance with the absence of otp1
signal in cyc embryos with intermediate phenotypes, ndr2
overexpression induces a moderate expansion of the PTspecific otp1 domain (up to 25% of the injected embryos)
(compare Fig. 7C with 7E, and Fig. 7D with 7F).

FGFs released from the isthmus and other organizing centres are required to pattern the neuroepithelium along its
dorsoventral and anteroposterior axes [59,60]. In
zebrafish embryo, tissues expressing fgf8 are observed in
close proximity with the otp1 cluster in PO (Fig. 7G–I).
Herein, the specification of otp1 cells in the PO is
repressed in 13 to 24% of the embryos at 19 hpf that overexpress FGF8 (Fig. 7L,M). The same cluster is expanded in
fgf8 (acerebellar, ace) mutant embryos at 28 hpf (Fig.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/6/50

9A,B). On the contrary, PT-specific otp1 expression is not
altered in both ace embryos and following fgf8 overexpression (Fig. 9B; data not shown).
Searching for regulative interactions between otp1 and HH
factors, we first compared expression patterns of shh and
patched-1 (ptc1), a Shh-specific receptor [38,61], with otp1.
In the prospective diencephalon, otp1-positive cells lie at
the ventro-lateral edges of ptc1 and shh expression
domains, therefore in a region exposed to elevate HH concentrations (Fig. 8A–D). Effects of synthetic shh mRNA
injections on otp1 expression were analysed at 17 and 20
hpf of development (Fig. 8E–K). The majority of embryos
injected with synthetic shh mRNA exhibits a disorganized
otp1 expression pattern in the hypothalamus. Interestingly, dorsalization of otp1-positive cells does not extend
to the thalamus, except for two peculiar cells (Fig. 8H,J).
Ectopic otp1 expression is also observed in the optic vesicle [62] (Fig. 8I). In the hindbrain of shh-overexpressing
embryos, otp1 transcripts are still orderly arranged
although as a single domain per rhombomere (compare
Fig. 8K with Fig. 4E).
Then, otp1 expression was studied in sonic you (syu) and
iguana (igu) mutant embryos, zebrafish strains characterized by functionally null alleles of, respectively, shh [38]
and the dzip1 gene, a negative regulator of HH signaling
gradients [39,40]. In 28 hpf syu mutants, the PO otp1 pattern is drastically reduced in size (Fig. 8L,M,O,P; Fig.
9A,C). On the contrary, loss of Dzip1 functions in igu
embryos induces a phenotype characterized by supernumerary PO otp1-positive cells (Fig. 8L,N,O,Q). In both
mutants, no obvious alterations of otp1 expression are
observed in the PT (Fig. 8L–Q).
Direct interactions between FGF and HH signaling were
approached by WISH analysis of otp1 transcripts in ace; syu
double mutant embryos, in which PO or PT clusters of
otp1 expression are not significantly altered (Fig. 9A,D).
DA neuronal progenitors and otp1 activity
Among populations of CA neurons described in the
zebrafish brain during development, the PT hosts distinct
groups of DA neuroblasts [63-66]. Our data support the
notion that otp1 transcription in the PT is functionally
linked with a population of DA neurons. Double labelling
of otp1 mRNA and TH, a marker of CA neurons in the
diencephalon, shows that a fraction of the DA neurons
placed in the PT, adjacent to the ventral flexure, express
otp1 (Fig. 10A,B). Moreover, the zebrafish mutant motionless (mot) features a reduction of DA neurons in the PT
[63]. Accordingly, the number of otp1 positive cells is
sharply decreased in this region in mot embryos at 34 hpf
(Fig. 10C,D). Finally, inactivation of otp1 translation by
microinjection of ATG-targeted morpholino oligonucle-

Discussion
Orthopedia (Otp) expression in vertebrate embryos is crucial for the correct determination of several cell lineages in
the neuroendocrine hypothalamus [16,17]. Indeed, Otp
null-mice die soon after birth due to the developmental
failure of the anterior periventricular, paraventricular, and
supraoptic hypothalamic nuclei, and the resultant incapability to secrete important neuro-hormones [16,17]. In
zebrafish, a detailed characterization of the CA neurotransmitter pathway makes this organism a favourite
model system to address the ontogeny of the vertebrate
neurosecretory system [63,64,66-77]. To investigate otp
regulation in vertebrate development, we have isolated
two otp zebrafish homologues (otp1 and otp2) and investigated the in vivo functions of shh, fgf8, and Nodal-related 1
signaling pathways on otp1 expression by means of morpholino-, mRNA- and mutant-based methodologies. The
conservative structure of the homeodomain region uncovered between the zebrafish Otp1, Otp2 proteins and the
rest of our data set indicates clearly that the above proteins
represent members of the Otp gene family of transcription
factors. The percentages of identity between the zebrafish
Otp homeodomains compared with the ones in Mus musculus, Dugesia japonica and Drosophila melanogaster are
found to be variable, reflecting distinct evolutionary relationships as well as functional differences. Moreover, each
of the Antp, Otp, and Otd/Otx gene clusters represent
phylogenetically distinct clades characterised by elevated
levels of sequence and structural homology. Our phylogenetic analysis of Otp proteins highly supports a Vertebrate
group, while it highlights two unorthodox subclades, one

otp1 gene expression domains are in close proximity to, or
within, organizing centres that express signaling factors.
In this report, we show that Nodal, SHH and FGF8 independently regulate otp1 expression during formation of
neural stem cells in the zebrafish forebrain. Since results
presented herein centred on functional effects occurring
within the first 2 days of development, TH-immunolabeling did not evidence neurons in the PO during our assays,
therefore impeding to connect otp1 activity with CA neurons in the anterodorsal hypothalamus. However, we
report the first case of involvement of otp in the determination of a subgroup of ventral hypothalamic CA neurons.
HH and FGF8 signaling pathways modulate otp1
expression in the hypothalamic preoptic area but not in
the posterior tuberculum
HH and FGF8 signaling pathways play key roles in the
ventral CNS patterning [78,79]. Our examination of syu,
igu, and ace mutants clearly revealed the dependency of
otp1 expression on shh and fgf8 at the level of the otp1 positive cluster located in the PO, where the two signaling
molecules are synthesized. Absence of Shh protein determines a marked attenuation of the size of the otp1 cluster
in the PO (alar plate) (Fig. 8L,M,O,P) [37-40]. This result
suggests that only the prospective otp1-positive cells in the
alar plate PO have acquired the competence (i.e. additional factors that modulate SHH signaling) to respond to
the high SHH concentration from the ventral neural tube
and then trigger otp1 expression. This is also supported by

(arrow). E, F, microinjection of otp1 morpholino oligonucleotide lowers the number of TH-labelled DA neuroblasts in the PT

the evidence that the PO otp1 signal increased in igu
mutants (Fig. 8L,N,O,Q), which are deficient in shh negative regulation [39,40]. Inhibition of the SHH pattern via
synthetic mRNA microinjection causes profound alterations in the spatial organization of the PO otp1 cluster, but
does not induce relevant changes in the number of the
otp1-expressing cells, suggesting that otp1 responsiveness
in the alar plate is dependent on additional positive regulators rather than negative factors hindering SHH signal
propagation.
Interestingly, ectopic otp1 expression after shh microinjection was selectively observed in the optic placodes (Fig.
8I) and in one fixed pair of cells in the roof of the dorsal
thalamus (Fig. 8H,J), suggestive of a predetermination to
respond to the shh signal.
The otp1 signal in the PO appeared significantly expanded
in the ace mutant (Fig. 9A,B), indicative of a negative role
for this signaling factor in the control of PO otp1 expression. To confirm this observation we altered the endogenous level of fgf8 by synthetic mRNA microinjection:
excess of FGF concentration reduces the size of the otp1positive PO cluster. As expected from a potential negative
regulator, fgf8 microinjection does not induce ectopic
expression of otp1. No major consequences on otp1
expression in the PT are noticed in embryos altered in FGF
and SHH signalings (Fig. 8M,P; Fig. 9B,C; data not
shown), supporting the conclusion that fgf8 and shh are
not required for otp1-based neuronal specification in the
posterior diencephalon.
Nodal affects otp1 expression in the preoptic area and is
necessary for otp1 activation in the posterior tuberculum,
where otp1 is required for the correct development of
catecholaminergic neurons
The ndr2 mutant cyclops (cyc) interferes with the Nodal
pathway causing massive defects in the rostral brain [5558]. Analysis of otp1 expression in cyc mutant embryos
with intermediate phenotypes (reduction of the ventral
diencephalon and partial fusion of the eyes) shows midline fusion of PO-specific otp1 expression; moreover, we
noticed that the domain is decreased in size (compare Fig.
7A,B with Fig. 5G,H). This phenotype could be in part
explained by the partial physical deficiency of the PO territory, but also by the repression of shh transcription in cyc
mutants [80], such that the reduction of otp1-expressing
cells after the disruption of Nodal signaling is determined
by intrinsic loss of shh (as we observed in syu mutants)
(Fig. 8M,P), pointing to the PO otp1 expression regulation
mediated by ndr2. We did not detect any otp1-expressing
cells in the PT of nodal (cyc) mutant embryos. This phenotype is not caused by shh deficiency since otp1 expression
in the posterior basal plate of the hypothalamus is not
modulated by HH signaling, but could be determined by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/6/50

the absence of the prosencephalic ventral structures. This
issue has been addressed overexpressing ndr2 and analyzing the effects on otp1 transcription in the PT area.
Increase of Ndr2 function is shown to determine the
expansion of the PT-specific otp1 domain (Fig. 7C–F), in
accordance with the opposite effect in the PT of cyc
embryos with intermediate phenotypes. Taken together,
these results are indicative of Nodal signaling as a positive
regulator of otp1 expression in the posterior basal plate of
the hypothalamus. Furthermore, Holzschuh and colleagues reported the loss of diencephalic DA neurons also
in MZsur, a Nodal mutant in which the PT correctly develops, therefore suggesting the direct involvement of Nodal
in the differentiation of the DA neuron in the posterior
tuberculum [81,82].
In this context, our findings allow to propose that the
Nodal contribution to the development of the CA neurons in PT might be mediated by otp1. Because both otp1and TH-positive neurons occur in the PT, we co-labelled
this area. Interestingly, otp1 and TH partially overlap in a
small clade of neuronal precursors (Fig. 10A,B). In these
cells, otp1 activation precedes of several hours that of
dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase genes [64]. In
addition, embryos of a zebrafish mutant that displays a
reduced number of hypothalamic DA neurons (motionless,
mot) [63] show less otp1-positive neurons (Fig. 10C,D).
The hypothesis of a subset of CA neurons requiring otp1
action for their differentiation was finally tested by microinjection of otp1-specific ATG-targeted morpholino oligonucleotides in wild type embryos. A mot mutant
phenocopy was generated at the PT level, with the repression of TH-positive cell differentiation (Fig. 10E,F). Altogether, these data confirm the otp1 gene as one functional
milestone towards the correct development of the CA system.

Conclusion
In this paper we provide strong circumstantial evidence of
regulatory links between otp1 expression and Nodal, SHH
and FGF signaling cascades in the hypothalamus. The first
piece of evidence demonstrates that Nodal, in concert with
fgf8 and shh, mediates otp1 expression in the preoptic area
(Fig. 11). Remarkably, our data indicate a second signaling mechanism in which nodal, but not fgf8 and shh, regulate early otp1 functions in the determination of CA
neurons in the posterior tuberculum (Fig. 11). The identification of otp1 as a key component in the differentiation
of diencephalic CA neurons will help in clarifying the
developmental bases of several human behavioural
aspects as well as pathologies such as addictions and Parkinson's disease.

Methods
Animals
Wild type zebrafish of the AB strain were maintained at
28°C on a 14 h light/10 h dark cycle under standard procedures [83]. Embryos were collected by natural spawning, staged according to Kimmel and co-workers [84] and
raised at 28°C in fish water (Instant Ocean, 0,1% Methylene Blue) in Petri dishes [85]. We express the embryonic
ages in somites (s) and hours post fertilization (hpf). The
following mutant alleles were used: aceti282a [37], cycb16
[55], mbltm213 [54], motm807 [39,40], syutbx392 [38] and
iguts294e [39,40].
Cloning
The zebrafish homologue of orthopedia (otp1) has been
isolated by means of PCR from a 16–40 hour old
zebrafish embryo cDNA library using degenerate primers
ort1_fw (5'-CCNGCNCAGCTSAACGA-3') and ort2_rv
(5'-CKYTTYTTCCAYTTNGC-3'),
corresponding
to
PAQLNE and AKWKKR regions of the mouse Otp homeodomain, respectively. The first round of PCR has been carried out using the ort2_rv degenerate primer with the T3

library-vector specific primer. An aliquot of this reaction
has been used as template with the ort1_fw and ort2_rv
primers. The 150 bp cDNA band obtained encoded a partial homeodomain identical to the corresponding residues of the mouse Otp protein. Gene- and vector-specific
primers were used on the same library to isolate the 5' and
3' ends of the otp1 mRNA.
Phylogenetic analysis
A total of 47 sequences, gathered from several EST and
genomic databases, were aligned using the ClustalW algorithm [86] as implemented in the Bioedit software v4.7.8
[87] under a variety of gap penalties assigned. Species

While Dugesia japonica (Dj) Otp sequence was obtained
directly from Umesono and co-workers [20], Hydra magnipapillata (Hm), Takifugu rubripes (Tr) and Tetraodon
nigroviridis (Tn) Otp sequences were generated in the
course of this study and are available from the authors.
The alignment was manually refined and used as the basis
for all tree reconstruction methods. Maximum parsimony
(MP) analysis was carried out in PAUP* 4.0b10 (Windows version) [88] using the heuristic search option, 100
random sequence additions and tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping. Maximum likelihood (ML)
analysis was performed using the quartet puzzling
method [89] implemented in the TREE-PUZZLE package
(version 5.0) [90] using the heuristic search option and
ten random sequence additions. A Bayesian phylogeny
was inferred, and posterior probabilities of individual
clades were calculated using a variant of the Markov chain
Monte Carlo algorithm as employed in MrBayes v3.1.2
[91]. Four Markov chains (three heated, one cold) were
run for 200000 generations using random starting trees
and the same model employed in branch length estimates, with trees saved every 100 generations. Bootstrap
support for individual nodes [92] was calculated on 1000
replicates using the same methods, options and constraints as in the tree-inferences, but removing identical
sequences. Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic reconstructions were constrained with the most
appropriate model for protein evolution that better fitted
the data. Likelihood values for each of 64 candidate models of protein evolution with the best-fitting parameters
(gamma distribution, proportion of invariable sites, character frequencies) were computed in the software ProtTest
v1.3 [93]. The best aminoacid replacement model for the
data was finally calculated using an Akaike (AIC), a second-order Akaike (AICc) and a Bayesian (BIC) information criteria.

RT-PCR
Total RNAs from 15 samples corresponding to 10 different developmental stage embryos (1–2 cells, 30% epiboly, 50% epiboly, 80% epiboly, 1–2 somites, 8 somites,
10 somites, 15–20 somites, 24 hpf, and 48 hpf) and 3
adult organs (oocyte, brain, testis) were purified, DNase
treated, and reverse-transcribed. The cDNAs obtained
were tested for the presence of otp1 expression using the
forward (zotpS: 5'-ATGCTCTCTCATGCCGACCT-3') and
reverse (zotpRv: 5'-TCTGTTGGTTTTGCTGGCCG-3') primers spanning the cDNA region involved in alternative
splicing. The products of the PCRs were loaded and
resolved onto 2% agarose gels.
In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry
WISH hybridization was carried out according to Thisse
and co-workers [47] on embryos fixed for 2 h in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate buffered saline, then rinsed
with PBS-Tween, dehydrated in 100% methanol and
stored at -20°C until processed for WISH [94]. Riboprobes were in vitro labelled with digoxigenin or fluorescein (Roche). For double WISH and antibody labelling,
WISH was performed first, then embryos were exposed to
rat anti-Tyrosine Hydroxilase (TH) (Chemicon) and
mouse anti-acetylated α-tubulin (Sigma). Embryos incubated with anti-TH were treated with biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories).
Injections
Synthetic capped shh, ndr2, and fgf8 mRNAs were injected
repeatedly (n > 3) at concentrations of 400, 200, and 200
pg per embryo, respectively. Injections were carried out on
1- to 2-cell stage embryos. To repress otp1 mRNA translation, an ATG-targeting morpholino was designed (Gene
Tools, LLC): 5'-CCAAGAGGTCGGCATGAGAGAGCAT-3'.
