Reduced stability of mRNA secondary structure
near the translation-initiation site in dsDNA
viruses
Tong Zhou1 and Claus O Wilke2*

Abstract
Background: Recent studies have demonstrated a selection pressure for reduced mRNA secondary-structure
stability near the start codon of coding sequences. This selection pressure can be observed in bacteria, archaea,
and eukaryotes, and is likely caused by the requirement of efficient translation initiation in cellular organism.
Results: Here, we surveyed the complete genomes of 650 dsDNA virus strains for signals of reduced stability of
mRNA secondary structure near the start codon. Our analysis included viruses infecting eukaryotic, prokaryotic, and
archaeic hosts. We found that many viruses showed evidence for reduced mRNA secondary-structure stability near
the start codon. The effect was most pronounced in viruses infecting prokaryotes, but was also observed in viruses
infecting eukaryotes and archaea. The reduction in stability generally increased with increasing genomic GC
content. For bacteriophage, the reduction was correlated with a corresponding reduction of stability in the phage
hosts.
Conclusions: We conclude that reduced stability of the mRNA secondary structure near the start codon is a
common feature for dsDNA viruses, likely driven by the same selective pressures that cause it in cellular organisms.

Background
Translation initiation is facilitated by specific nucleotide
patterns near the start codon. Upstream of the start
codon, sequence features such as the Shine-Dalgarno
sequence (in prokaryotes) and the Kozak sequence (in
eukaryotes) prime the ribosome to initiate translation
[1-7]. Downstream of the start codon, various sequence
features promote translation initiation. For example, in
Escherichia coli, the codon AAA seems to enhance
translation initiation [8]. More generally, translation
initiation is enhanced if the mRNA downstream of the
start codon is AT-rich and does not form a stable secondary structure [9-13].
Experimental and computational work in E. coli
showed that gene expression levels are correlated to the
thermodynamic stability of mRNA secondary structure
near the start codon—lower stability implied higher

protein abundance [13]. Recent computational studies
have shown that the secondary-structure stability of
mRNA segments near the start codon is on average
lower than expected [14,15]. Tuller et al. found that, in
both E. coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mRNA secondary-structure stability is reduced at the beginning of
ORFs [14]. A more comprehensive study by Gu et al.
demonstrated that this reduction in stability occurs in
most cellular organisms, including bacteria, archaea,
fungi, plants, insects, and fishes [15]. The reduction in
stability generally increased with increasing genomic GC
content. In birds and mammals, the pattern was not
found genome-wide but did occur in the most GC-rich
genes.
Here, we extended the analysis of Gu et al. [15] to
dsDNA viruses. We analyzed the local mRNA secondary
structure at the 5’ end of the coding region in 650
dsDNA virus strains. We used computational methods
to predict the thermodynamic stability of local mRNA
secondary structure in sliding windows downstream
from the start codon, as described [15]. We addressed
the following questions: (i) Is there a selection pressure

ZΔG (91−120 nt)

We performed a sliding-window analysis of mRNA
secondary-structure stability in 650 fully sequenced dsDNA viruses. For each ORF in each virus, we calculated
Z scores ZΔG. ZΔG measures to what extent mRNA secondary-structure stability deviates from random expectation given the amino-acid sequence and codon
composition of the ORF [15]. A ZΔG > 0 indicates that
the structure is less stable than expected, and a ZΔG < 0
indicates the opposite. We calculated ZΔG > 0 for windows of length 30 nucleotides (nt), and we covered the
first 150 nt of each ORF in steps of 10 nt, as described
[15]. For each window, we then averaged ZΔG over all
ORFs in each genome. We refer to this genome-wide
¯
average as Z G. Below, we test whether this genomewide average is significantly different from zero. Note
that the genome-wide average can be significantly nonzero even if the Z scores for individual genes are relatively small and would individually not be considered
significant.
¯
Figure 1 shows Z G as a function of window position
¯
for bacteriophage T7. In this virus, Z G is significantly
¯
larger than zero in the first window (t-test, Z G = 0.35,
P = 0.005), and it is not significantly different from zero
in windows further downstream. We carried out a
similar analysis on all virus strains in our data set. As in
cellular organisms, there was substantial variation in the
¯
Z G of the first window among different virus strains
and somewhat less variation in windows further downstream (Figure 2). Allowing for a false-discovery rate of
¯
5%, we found 181 dsDNA viruses (28%) whose Z G in
the first window was significantly non-zero. With the
exception of 3 viruses infecting eukaryotes (epiphyas
postvittana nucleopolyhedrovirus, cowpox virus, and
¯
canarypox virus), Z G was positive in all these cases. For
windows further downstream, the number of virus
¯
strains with significantly non-zero Z G declined rapidly,
¯ G tended to be negative rather than positive
and Z
(Figures 2 and 3). These results mirror the results of Gu
¯
et al. [15], who found that Z G was generally positive
near the start codon and negative further downstream.

Figure 3 Number of dsDNA virus strains with significantly non-zero Z G after false-discovery-rate correction for multiple testing, as a
function of the location of the analysis window. The analysis was carried out on 419 dsDNA viruses with prokaryotic hosts, 204 with
¯
eukaryotic hosts, and 27 with archaeic hosts. A value of Z G > 0 indicates less stable mRNA secondary structure than expected.
¯
On average, archaeic viruses had a Z G of 0.0049, not
significantly different from zero (t-test, P = 0.91). Eukaryotic viruses had an average of 0.057, which was significantly different from zero (t-test, P = 3.2 × 10 -5 ).
Prokaryotic viruses had an average of 0.22, also signifi¯
cantly different from zero (t-test, P < 10-10). The Z G
distribution for prokaryotic viruses was significantly
different from those for eukaryotic viruses (t-test,
P < 10-10) and archaeic viruses (t-test, P = 2.1 × 10-5).
Since we obtained Z ΔG by shuffling codons within
genes, we implicitly assumed that there is no sub-stantial, site-specific selection on synonymous sites outside
the focal analysis window. This assumption is violated
in regions where reading frames overlap and synonymous sites are primarily determined by the amino-acid
sequence of the overlapping reading frame. Therefore,
we tested whether our ZΔG values were confounded by
overlapping reading frames. For all ORFs in all virus
genomes, we determined whether they overlapped with
any other ORFs and classified them into overlapping
and non-overlapping ORFs. We found that on average
50% of the ORFs in a virus genome were overlapping,
with a standard deviation of 15.9 percentage points. We
then tested for each window in each virus genome
whether the mean ZΔG for overlapping genes was different from the mean Z ΔG for non-overlapping genes,
using t tests. We found that this was generally not the
case. Allowing for a false-discovery rate of 5%, not a single virus genome showed a significant difference
between overlapping and non-overlapping ORFs in the
first four windows. Over all 13 windows, there were
only two cases were we could reject the null hypothesis
of no difference, invertebrate iridescent virus 3 in window 5 and clanis bilineata nucleopolyhedrosis virus in
window 11.
However, when pooling data from all viruses into a
single analysis, we found a small shift towards lower

¯
Z G values for overlapping ORFs in eukaryotic and
archaeic (but not prokaryotic) viruses (Additional File 1
Figure S1). We concluded that there was no evidence
¯
that overlap influences Z G in prokaryotic viruses, and
weak evidence that it does so in the other two types of
viruses. Since gene overlap certainly does not increase
¯
Z G, we concluded that including both overlapping and
non-overlapping ORFs in our analysis was a conservative approach. Therefore, we freely mixed overlapping
and non-overlapping ORFs throughout our analysis. The
¯
reduced Z G in eukaryotic and archaeic viruses compared to prokaryotic viruses was not due to the inclu¯
sion of overlapping ORFs; Z G values for all virus
groups were nearly identical regardless of whether overlapping ORFs were included or not (not shown).
For a few select virus species, we also tested whether
our results were confounded by dinucleotide frequencies. We calculated alternate ZΔG values using reshuffled
sequences in which all dinucleotide frequencies had
been held constant. We found that our standard shuffling method and the dinucleotide shuffling method
resulted in nearly identical Z scores (Additional File 1
Figure S2). Note that in the dinucleotide shuffling
method, we shuffled synonymous codons such that both
amino-acid sequence and dinucleotide frequencies were
held constant. The algorithm to perform this shuffling is
fairly computationally expensive and runs approximately
24 times slower than regular codon shuffling.
Relationship between genomic GC composition
and mean 5’ ZΔG

¯
For the remainder of this work, we refer to the Z G at
the very start of the coding sequence (in sliding window
¯
#1) as the 5’ Z G. To explain the variation observed in
¯
the 5’ Z G, we correlated it with the mean GC content
in coding sequences, since this quantity is a good pre¯
dictor of the 5’ Z G in cellular organisms [15].

PIC of ZΔG (1−30 nt)

Because different virus strains are evolutionarily
¯
related, a relationship between 5’ Z G and GC content
may be confounded by the viral phylogeny [16]. We can
avoid this issue by correlating phylogenetically independent contrasts (PIC), which are differences of variables
among organisms [16]. We found that the PIC of the 5’
¯
Z G were well correlated with the PIC of the GC content in coding sequences (r = 0.53, P = 10-31 for prokaryotic viruses, r = 0.54, P = 10-17 for eukaryotic viruses,
and r = 0.49, P = 0.009 for archaeic viruses, see also
Figure 4). Genomes with higher GC content had comparatively less stable mRNA secondary structure near
the start codon.
Because mRNA stability was reduced only at the
translation-initiation region, we expected that the corre¯
lation between PIC of Z G and PIC of GC content
¯ G was caluclated for windows
should decrease when Z
further downstream. Thus, we calculated the corresponding correlation coefficient for all windows. We
found that indeed the correlation declined continuously
and was consistently near zero (for eukaryotic viruses)
or negative (for prokaryotic or archaeic viruses) from
the 5th window onwards (Additional File 1 Figure S3).
Since the thermodynamic stability of RNA secondary
structure tends to be correlated to the RNA’s GC content, we also considered local deviations in a gene’s GC
content. We calculated ZGC, which measures the deviation in GC content in a 30 nt window relative to the
average GC content in the gene (see Materials and
Methods). We found a negative correlation between PIC
¯
of genomic GC content and PIC of ZGC in the first win-84

Figure S4). Thus, in GC-rich viruses, the sequence
regions immediately downstream of the start codon
have undergone stronger GC reduction.
We also analyzed to what extent ΔG (rather than its
deviation from expectation, as measured by ZΔG) varied
with GC content. Our results mirrored those we had
previously found for cellular organisms [15]. There was
a strong negative correlation between the mean ΔG and
GC content (Additional File 1 Figure S5). The higher
the GC content, the more stable the mRNA secondary
structure, even in the first window. We also tested for a
correlation between GC content and the difference in
stability between the first window and the tenth window, and found that this difference increased in viruses
infecting prokaryotic or eukaryotic hosts, but not in
those infecting archaeic hosts (r = 0.68, P < 10-15 for
prokaryotic viruses, r = 0.37, P = 10 -7 for eukaryotic
viruses, and r = 0.37, P = 0.06 for archaeic viruses, see
also Additional File 1 Figure S6). These results remained
unchanged when correcting for phylogeny (not shown).
Host-specific patterns in bacteriophages

Finally, we asked to what extent sequence features in
viruses correlated with corresponding features in their
hosts. Previous work has shown that synonymous codon
usage in bacteriophages exhibits significant bias towards
host-preferred codons [17], and that genomic GC content in some phages is close to the genomic GC content
of their host organisms [18,19]. Thus, we would expect
¯
more generally that both GC content and 5’ Z G in
viruses correlate with the same quantities in the appropriate host organisms.
For all bacteriophages in our data set, we identified
the corresponding host organism based on the information provided by RefSeq. We then compared GC content in phages and hosts. We found that the GC
content in phages correlated strongly with the GC content of the host (correlation coefficient r = 0.89, P ≪
10-15, Figure 5). More specifically, Figure 5 suggests that
the phage’s GC content places a lower limit on the GC
content of host organisms the phages can infect. Nearly
all data points fall below the dashed line indicating identical GC content for phages and hosts. Moreover, some
phages with low GC content are associated with hosts
with high GC content, but phages with high GC content
are never associated with hosts with low GC content.
The correlation between phage and host GC content
may, however, be confounded by phylogeny, as
explained in the previous subsection. One complication
here is that the phylogeny of phages is not necessarily
the same as the phylogeny of the hosts. We are not
aware of any method that can correctly compare two
data sets with distinct covariance structures. Therefore,
we opted for two strategies. On the one hand, we

calculated correlations without considering phylogeny at
all, and thus obtained the value r = 0.89 cited above. On
the other hand, we considered the GC content of the
host a measurement on the virus, and thus used the
virus phylogeny to calulate PIC for both virus and host
GC content. The correlation we obtained in this way
was nearly indistinguishable from the one obtained not
controlling for phylogeny at all (correlation coefficient r
= 0.88, P = 10-60, Additional File 1 Figure S7).
¯
We also analyzed whether the 5’ Z G in bacterio¯
phages correlated with that in their hosts. The 5’ Z G
values for the phage hosts were obtained from [15]. We
found a significant positive correlation, both when
ignoring the phylogeny (correlation coefficient r = 0.53,
P ≪ 10-12, Figure 6) and when using the phage phylo¯
geny to calculate PIC for both phage and host 5’ Z G
(correlation coefficient r = 0.50, P ≪ 10-12, Additional
File 1 Figure S8).

Discussion
We have studied the mRNA stability at the translationinitiation region of protein-coding genes in 650 genomes
of dsDNA viruses. We have found for many of these
viruses that there is a tendency for reduced mRNA stability in the first 30-40 nt of the coding sequence. In
this region, mRNA stability tends to be less than
expected given a gene’s amino-acid sequence and
codon-usage bias. We have also found that GC content
of coding sequences is a major predictor of the reduction in mRNA stability. The higher the GC content, the
larger the reduction in mRNA stability at the 5’ end of

¯
the coding sequence (i.e., the larger 5’ Z G). For bacter¯
iophage, the 5’ Z G also correlates positively with the 5’
¯
Z G in the host organisms.
Experimental and computational work had previously
shown that increased local mRNA stability in the translation-initiation region impaired translation initiation in
E. coli [11,13]. Two computational studies suggested
that this effect exists more broadly in both prokaryotes
and eukaryotes [14,15]. Here, we have shown that similar selection pressures exist in the viral kingdom.
As in cellular organisms, the region with reduced
mRNA stability is located right downstream from the
start codon and has a length of 30 to 40 nt (the first
two windows in our analysis). Past the first two win¯
dows, Z G tends to be zero or slightly negative. In cellu¯
lar organisms, Z G is consistently negative downstream
¯
from the start codon [15]. The lack of a negative Z G in
most virus genomes likely reflects lack of statistical
power, a consequence of the small genomes of viruses.
The strong positive correlation between genomic GC
composition and the reduction of mRNA stability at the
translation-initiation region is in agreement with the
finding by Gu et al. [15].
In contrast to cellular organisms, viruses frequently
have overlapping ORFs. In fact, nearly all viruses in our
analysis had at least one overlapping ORF. Our codonshuffling approach conserves the amino-acid sequence
of the focal ORF, but does not conserve the amino-acid
sequence of any second ORF that overlaps with the
focal one. Thus, overlapping sequences will experience
additional selective constraint that our approach does
not accurately take into account. In principle, this issue
could cause spurious results. However, we found that

Zhou and Wilke BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:59
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/59

¯
there is little difference in Z G values in overlapping and
¯
non-overlapping ORFs. At worst, Z G values in overlapping ORFs are reduced compared to those in non-overlapping ORFs (Additional File 1 Figure S1). Therefore,
treating overlapping ORFs as non-overlapping ORFs, as
we have effectively done throughout much of this work,
is a conservative approach when looking for elevated
¯
Z G values.
¯
To understand why Z G increased with increasing GC
content, we also considered the raw ΔG values. One can
envision two extreme cases of how ΔG might depend
on GC content. On the one hand, the ΔG in the first
window might be required to be at a fixed low value,
independent of GC content, to enable efficient translation. The ΔGs further downstream would be expected
to decrease with increasing GC content, due to the
higher thermodynamic stabiltiy of GC bonds. On the
other hand, the ΔG in the first window might always
differ by a fixed amount from ΔGs further downstream,
independent of GC content. We found the reality to be
somewhere in between these two extreme cases. Even
though the ΔG in the first window showed a strong
negative correlation with GC content, the difference in
ΔG was not constant for prokaryotic or eukaryotic
viruses, for which it increased strongly and moderately,
respectively. For archaeic viruses, however, it did not
¯
significantly increase. Since the correlation between Z G
and GC was of comparable magnitude for all three
groups, we infer that two separate mechanisms are at
play. First, for prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses, the
requirement for decreased stability in the first window
increases with increasing GC content. Second, in gen¯
eral, the Z G measure seems to become more powerful
for sequences with increased GC content, because the
higher the GC, the less likely it is that a reshuffled
sequence shows reduced stability.
For bacteriophages, we addressed the question
whether the requirement of low mRNA secondary-struc¯
ture stability in host genomes affects the 5’ Z G in
phages. Because phages share the cellular environment
and translation machinery with their hosts, we would
expect that phages are optimized for the expression
machinery of their hosts. We found a significant positive
¯
correlation between the 5’ Z G in phage genomes and
that in their hosts. We also observed an even stronger
correlation between the genomic GC content in phages
and that in their hosts. Moreover, we found that a
phage’s GC content seems to impose a lower limit on
the GC content of the hosts it can infect (Figure 5).
These host-specific results are consistent with previous
reports that synonymous codon usage in bacteriophage
mimicks that of their hosts [17] and that viral and host
GC content are similar in certain cases (Mycobacterium

Page 6 of 8

tuberculosis, 63.6% phage vs. 65.6% host, [18]; Staphylococcus aureus, 33.7% phage vs. 32.9% host, [19]).
¯
We used independent contrasts to assess whether Z G
correlated with GC content. The independent contrasts
method requires an accurate phylogeny of the organisms
under study. Such a phylogeny is difficult to obtain for
viruses, because viruses have either arisen multiple
times independently or their common ancestor is extremely ancient [20-23]. In our analysis, we separately considered viruses infecting eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and
archaea, and used phylogenetic trees derived from the
taxonomic classification of these viruses. The branch
lengths in these trees reflect simply the number of taxonomic levels that two viruses are separated by. Therefore, the branch lengths are almost certainly incorrect.
Nevertheless, these trees should at a minimum remove
any major biases that might arise if some groups of
viruses were more heavily sampled than others. We
found generally that the results based on PIC were
nearly identical to results calculated on the raw data
(not shown). Therefore, we believe that our results are
not strongly confounded by phylogeny and that the correction for phylogeny we employed was sufficient.
In our comparison of viruses with their hosts, we
encountered the added complication that virus and host
trees will in general not be identical. We are not aware
of any method that can calculate correct correlations in
this scenario. We addressed this issue by considering
both the raw data and PIC based on the virus trees
(because properties of the virus host can be considered
as a measurement on the virus). Again, both methods
produced nearly identical results. Thus, it is unlikely
that the results are strongly confounded by phylogeny.

Conclusions
Many dsDNA viruses show evidence for reduced mRNA
secondary-structure stability near the start codon. The
effect is the strongest in viruses infecting prokaryotes,
but exists also in viruses infecting eukaryotes and
archaea. For bacteriophage, the reduction tends to cooccur with a corresponding reduction of stability in the
phage hosts. Thus, the same selective pressures that
cause reduced stability of mRNA secondary structure in
cellular organisms likely also act on the viruses infecting
these organisms.
Methods
We collected virus genomes from the NCBI RefSeq project ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/release/viral/. We only
considered coding sequences longer than 50 codons. We
also excluded virus genomes that had 10 or fewer genes
(overlapping reading frames were considered as different
genes). We ended up with 650 genomes for dsDNA

Zhou and Wilke BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:59
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/59

viruses (419 with prokaryotic hosts, 204 with eukaryotic
hosts, and 27 with archaeic hosts). To test whether
overlapping ORFs confounded our analysis, we classified
all ORFs into overlapping and non-overlapping ones.
We defined the ORFs that had no genome region shared
with any other ORFs as non-overlapping ORFs. All the
other ORFs were considered as overlapping ones.
We analyzed the stability of local mRNA secondary
structure exactly as described [15]. In brief, we calculated the local folding energy (ΔG) along the mRNA
sequence using a sliding window of 30 nucleotides (nt),
moving from the start codon to the 120th downstream
nucleotide in steps of 10 nt (for a total of 13 windows).
We calculated ΔG using the RNAfold program in the
Vienna package [24,25] under default settings: folding
occurred at 37°C; GU pairs were allowed; unpaired
bases could participate in at most one dangling end;
energy parameters were obtained from [26]. We evaluated only the minimum-free-energy structure.
To quantify the deviation from expectation given a
gene’s amino-acid sequence and codon usage bias, we
also calculated ΔG for 1000 permuted mRNA
sequences. We obtained permuted sequences by randomly reshuffling synonymous codons within each gene.
We then calculated a Z-score, ZΔG, by comparing the
ΔG of the real mRNA segment to the distribution of
ΔG values of the permuted sequences, as described [15].
ZΔG measures the extent to which local mRNA stability
deviates from expectation. A positive ZΔG means that
local mRNA stability is reduced, and a negative Z ΔG
means that it is increased. We also evaluated the difference in local GC composition between the actual and
randomized sequences via a Z-score ZGC, as described
[15]. For a few select virus species, we also tested
whether our results were confounded by dinucleotide
frequencies. We randomized virus mRNA sequences
using a dinucleotide shuffling algorithm [27]. This algorithm preserves the dinucleotide composition as well as
the codon use frequency in the reshuffled sequence.
We corrected for phylogenetic relationship among
viruses by calculating phylogenetically independent contrasts (PIC), using the R library ape, version 2.5-1. We
used three separate phylogenetic trees, one for viruses
infecting eukaryotes, one for viruses infecting prokaryotes, and one for viruses infecting archaea. Since widely
diverged viruses cannot be aligned, the phylogenetic
trees we used were constructed purely based on taxonomic classification, as provided by NCBI’s taxonomy
tool http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy.
We matched viruses to hosts using the “host” attribute
in the “source” feature of the genbank file provided by
RefSeq. We obtained quantities for hosts (such as GC
content, ZΔG) from our previous study [15].
