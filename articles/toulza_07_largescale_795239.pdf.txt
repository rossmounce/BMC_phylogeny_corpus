Results: Using the ORESTES method, 22,585 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were produced that
matched 3,387 genes. Despite normalization provided by this method (mean 4.6 ORESTES per
gene), some highly transcribed genes, including that encoding dermokine, were overrepresented.
About 330 expressed genes displayed less than 100 ESTs in UniGene clusters and are most likely
to be specific for GKs and potentially involved in barrier function. This hypothesis was tested by
comparing the relative expression of 73 genes in the basal and granular layers of epidermis by
quantitative RT-PCR. Among these, 33 were identified as new, highly specific markers of GKs,
including those encoding a protease, protease inhibitors and proteins involved in lipid metabolism
and transport. We identified filaggrin 2 (also called ifapsoriasin), a poorly characterized member of
the epidermal differentiation complex, as well as three new lipase genes clustered with paralogous
genes on chromosome 10q23.31. A new gene of unknown function, C1orf81, is specifically
disrupted in the human genome by a frameshift mutation.

Background: During epidermal differentiation, keratinocytes progressing through the suprabasal
layers undergo complex and tightly regulated biochemical modifications leading to cornification and
desquamation. The last living cells, the granular keratinocytes (GKs), produce almost all of the
proteins and lipids required for the protective barrier function before their programmed cell death
gives rise to corneocytes. We present here the first analysis of the transcriptome of human GKs,
purified from healthy epidermis by an original approach.

Abstract

Toulza et al.

Background

High-throughput genomic projects focusing on the identification of cell- and tissue-specific transcriptomes are expected to
uncover fundamental insights into biological processes. Particularly intriguing are genes in sequenced genomes that
remain hypothetical and/or poorly represented in expressed
sequence databases, and whose functions in health and disease remain unknown. Some of these are most probably
implicated in organ-specific functions. Their characterization
is essential to complete the annotation of sequenced genomes
and is expected to contribute to advances in physiology and
pathology. In order to achieve such goals, transcriptome studies on tissues rather than cultured cells, and eventually on a
single cell type at a precise differentiation step are more likely
to provide new information.
The epidermis is a highly specialized tissue mainly dedicated
to the establishment of a barrier that restricts both water loss
from the body and ingress of pathogens. The barrier function
of the epidermis is known to involve the expression of numerous tissue-specific genes, most of which are specifically
expressed in the late steps of keratinocyte differentiation. In
order to establish and constantly maintain this barrier, keratinocytes undergo a complex, highly organized and tightly
controlled differentiation program leading to cornification
and finally to desquamation. During this process, cells
migrate from the basal, proliferative layer to the surface,
where they form the cornified layer (stratum corneum).
According to the current model of skin epithelial maintenance, basal keratinocytes encompass a heterogeneous cell
population that includes slow-cycling stem cells [1]. These
stem cells give rise to transiently amplifying keratinocytes
that constitute most of the basal layer. They divide only a few
times and finally move upward while differentiating to form
the spinous layer. The proliferating compartment is characterized by the specific expression of cell cycle regulators and
integrin family members responsible for the attachment of
the epidermis to the basement membrane. Growth arrested
keratinocytes undergo differentiation, mainly characterized
by a shift in cytokeratin expression from KRT5 (keratin 5) and
KRT14 in the basal layer to KRT1 and KRT10 in suprabasal
layers. As differentiation progresses, keratinocytes from the
spinous layers progressively express a small number of specific differentiation markers, like involucrin. However, the
differentiation program culminates in the granular layer,
where keratinocytes express more than 30 epidermis-specific
proteins, including proteins that are stored in cytosolic granules characteristic of granular keratinocytes (GKs). These
proteins include well known components of the cornified
layer, like loricrin and elafin, but also recently identified ones,
such as keratinocyte differentiation associated protein
(KDAP), hornerin, suprabasin, keratinocyte proline rich protein (hKPRP), and so on [2-5].
GKs undergo a special programmed cell death, called cornification, which gives rise to corneocytes that no longer exhibit

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R107

transcriptional or translational activity and are devoid of
organelles. Rather, their intracellullar content consists of a
homogeneous matrix composed mainly of covalently linked
keratins. The cornified envelope, a highly specialized insoluble structure, encapsulates corneocytes in place of their
plasma membrane (see Kalinin et al. [6] for a recent review).
The lipid-enriched extracellular matrix, which subserves the
barrier, is produced by a highly active lipid factory mainly
operative in the granular layer and comprises secretory
organelles named the epidermal lamellar bodies [7]. In addition to the provision of lipids for the barrier, lamellar bodies
deliver a large number of proteins, including lipid-processing
enzymes, proteases and anti-proteases that regulate desquamation, antimicrobial peptides and corneodesmosin, an
adhesive protein secondarily located in the external face of
the desmosomes, as they turn into corneodesmosomes [8].
Therefore, the components of the stratum corneum, responsible for most of the protective cutaneous functions, are produced by GKs.
Transcriptome studies of selected cell types of the human epidermis are expected to contribute to the elucidation of the
mechanisms responsible for barrier function. They will also
shed further light on the causes of monogenic genodermatoses and the pathomechanisms of common complex skin
disorders like psoriasis. However, present knowledge on the
gene repertoire expressed by keratinocytes remains largely
fragmentary. Among the approximately eight million human
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the dbEST division of
the GenBank database, only 1,210 are annotated as originating from the epidermis, although these are, in fact, derived
from cultured keratinocytes, which do not fully recapitulate
the complex in vivo differentiation program. In this article,
we describe the results of a large-scale cDNA sequencing
project on GKs of healthy human skin, purified by a new
method. In order to characterize genes expressed at a low
level and to avoid the repetitive sequencing of highly
expressed ones, we used the ORESTES (open reading frame
EST) method to prepare a large series of small size cDNA
libraries using arbitrarily chosen primers for reverse transcription (RT) and PCR amplification [9]. The sequencing of
about 25,000 clones has produced a list of 3,387 genes
expressed by GKs. Some of them, analyzed by quantitative
RT-PCR, were shown to be expressed in a cell-specific manner. This effort resulted in a large number of novel candidate
genes of importance for the epidermis barrier function and
the etiology of genodermatoses.

Results
Purification of human granular keratinocytes
As a first step in this transcriptome project we devised a
method to purify GKs. Iterative incubations of pieces of
human epidermis with trypsin were performed to give three
suspended cell fractions (hereafter named T1-T3) and finally
to isolate cells attached to the stratum corneum (T4 fraction).

PolyA+ RNA was extracted from the T4 fraction from individual 3 (Table 1) and used to generate cDNA mini-libraries
using the ORESTES method [9]. This sample was chosen as it
presents the highest T1/T4 expression ratio for the KRT14
gene, suggesting a low contamination of the T4 fraction by
basal keratinocytes. This method uses arbitrarily chosen
primers for reverse transcription and PCR amplification. The
successful amplification of a mRNA thus depends primarily
on partial sequence homology with the primer, rather than on
its abundance. This, and the elimination of cDNA preparations that display prominent bands on gels (indicative of the
selective amplification of particular mRNAs), results in a normalization process and allows the detection of rare transcripts. We constructed 150 cDNA libraries with different
primers, the analysis of 100-200 clones from each leading to
the production of 22,585 sequences (Figure 2a). Among

The normalization ability of the ORESTES method was examined by classifying genes according to the number of matching sequences in the dataset (Figure 2b). Half of the genes
were represented by a unique sequence and 76.3% by three or
less sequences, thus showing an acceptable level of normalization, with a mean of 4.6 ORESTES per gene. However, the
ORESTES method only partially compensates for transcript
abundance, as several genes were represented by a large
ORESTES number. In these cases, we examined the number
of sequences in the corresponding UniGene clusters, a rough
measure of gene expression level. This revealed two situations: first, the gene is strongly expressed in many cell types
including GKs (a high number of both ORESTES and UniGene entries); and second, the gene is particularly expressed
in GKs (a high number of ORESTES, but low number of UniGene entries). The first category mainly includes housekeeping genes from the translation machinery (for example, RPS8,
EEF1A1, RPL3, RPL7A, RPL28; Table 2). The second category
contains genes previously described as implicated in epidermis barrier function (for example, KRT1, DMKN, LEP7, FLG,
KRT2A, SPRR2E, CASP14, CDSN, hKRP, SBSN) and, interestingly, new candidates for this function (TSPAN5, DUOX2,
TMEM14C, SERPINA12, SLC22A5, FLG2, C7orf24).
Dermokine (DMKN), represented by 217 ORESTES, was
shown to be selectively transcribed in mouse GKs by highthroughput in situ hybridization [15] and signal sequence
trap [16] screens. The present ORESTES dataset allowed us to
describe 13 novel human DMKN splicing isoforms with distinct subcellular locations and expression patterns [17].

these, 1,453 (approximately 6%) corresponded to empty plasmids or uninformative sequences, 377 (1.7%) were of bacterial
origin, and 2,303 (10%) matched the human mitochondrial
genome. Despite two rounds of polyA+ RNA purification,
1,859 sequences (8.2%) arose from ribosomal RNA. In addition, 187 sequences corresponded to unspliced intergenic
DNA and may reflect spurious transcriptional activity. The
remaining 16,591 sequences (73%) matched known or predicted transcribed regions, of which 62% aligned with the
human genome in several blocks, and thus corresponded to
spliced transcripts. After clustering, we observed the transcription of 3,387 genes by GKs. Additionally, 23 sequences
matched overlapping exons belonging to two genes transcribed in opposite orientations and thus could not be attributed to a single gene.

reviews

Morphological analyses revealed that after three treatments,
residual epidermal fragments were mostly composed of corneocytes and GKs (Figure 1). Quantitative real-time PCR was
performed to quantify the enrichment in GKs. To first select a
reference gene for normalization, the relative expression of
eight housekeeping genes (GAPDH, SOD1, ACTB, B2M,
HPRT1, HMBS, TBP and UBC) in each cell fraction (T1-T4)
was analyzed using GeNorm [10]. In agreement with previous
data [11], beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) appeared to be stably
expressed during epidermis differentiation, and was thus
chosen for normalization. In addition, we used the lectin
Galectin-7 (LSGAL7), which was previously shown by in situ
hybridization to be equally expressed in all epidermal layers
[12]. BPAG2 (bullous pemphigoid antigen 2) or KRT14, and
KLK7 (kallikrein 7, also called stratum corneum chymotryptic
enzyme (SCCE)) were selected as specific for the basal layer or
the GKs, respectively [13,14]. For four cell fractionations from
different individuals, the mean T1/T4 expression ratio of
KRT14 was 13, whereas the mean T4/T1 expression ratio of
SCCE was approximately 130 (Table 1). The KRT14 ratio
might be indicative of a slight contamination of the T4 fraction with basal keratinocytes. Nevertheless, the large SCCE
ratio indicates that very few, if any, GKs were present in the
T1 fraction. From this, we concluded that the T4 fraction was
highly enriched in GKs and thus suitable for a large-scale
study of their transcriptome.

As few sequencing projects from human epidermis have been
performed so far (relative to other organs), genes expressed
during the late steps of epidermis differentiation are poorly
represented in sequence databases. Among the 3,375 genes
from our set, 330 (10%) corresponded to UniGene clusters
containing less than 100 mRNA/EST sequences, and were
thus good candidates for epidermis late-expressed genes.
These were subdivided into five classes. The first one contains
all the genes (50) already known to be specifically expressed
in the suprabasal layers (Table 3). This confirms that lateexpressed genes are poorly represented in EST databases.
The second class consisted of 31 genes with known or inferred
functions that were previously known as mainly expressed in
a specific tissue different from epidermis (Table 4). We suggest that some of them might play a specific role in epidermal
differentiation. This could be the case for SERPINA12,
DUOX2, and, to a lesser extent, CASZ1, which are represented
by a large ORESTES number. We also suspect that CLDN23
might play an important role in GKs, since claudin-based
tight junctions in the granular layer contribute to barrier
function of the epidermis [20]. Accordingly, claudin-1-deficient mice display a lethal defect in skin permeability [21].
The third class gathered 32 uncharacterized paralogues of
known genes (Table 5). The fourth class was composed of 105
genes that remain hypothetical and about which nothing is
known regarding their normal function or disease relevance
(Table 6). The fifth class contained genes that are expressed,
most probably at low levels, in numerous tissues, but whose
epidermal expression is, to the best of our knowledge,
described here for the first time (Additional data file 2). Several genes from these five classes were selected to quantify
their expression in the course of epidermal differentiation by
real-time PCR (see below).

Expressed retrogenes and pseudogenes
Pseudogenes generally correspond to retrocopies with many
disruptions in their open reading frame (ORF). However, it is
now recognized that a large number of retrocopies are transcribed and can encode functional proteins [22]. Among the
top 50 transcribed retrocopies reported by these authors, 11
were detected in GKs by the ORESTES method. Among these,
calmodulin-like 3 (CALML3) was previously shown to be specific for keratinocyte terminal differentiation [23]. We identified two other expressed retrogenes corresponding to the

information

Moreover, six unspliced ORESTES correspond to a part of
intron 8 of the PPP2R5A gene, and include the small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) U98b sequence. The snoRNAs are nonprotein-coding RNAs that guide the 2'O-ribose methylation
(C/D box snoRNAs) or the pseudouridylation (H/ACA box
snoRNAs) of ribosomal RNAs, and are generally processed

from introns of RNA polymerase II transcripts [24]. Interestingly, the U98b snoRNA is a primate-specific retroposon of
the ACA16 snoRNA hosted by the PNAS-123 gene [25]. We
thus suggest that the ORESTES from the PPP2R5A gene correspond to a precursor form of the U98b snoRNA, and that
snoRNA retroposons can indeed be expressed when located
in an intron of a new host gene in the sense orientation.
Therefore, our ORESTES dataset included transcripts from
retrogenes, originating either from spliced pre-mRNAs or
from an intron-encoded snoRNA gene.

gene is the host gene for 10 C/D box snoRNAs [26]. Other
snoRNA host genes included in our ORESTES dataset are
RPS11, RPS12, RPL10 and EIF4A1. In certain cases,
ORESTES contain the snoRNA sequence (U39B in RPS11,
mgU6-77 in EIF4A1, U70 in RPL10), and probably correspond to alternative splicing forms of the host gene mRNA,
with intron retention.
We furthermore obtained sequences for long, non-proteincoding transcripts. Metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1, (MALAT-1, 22 ORESTES) is a conserved
long non-protein-coding RNA (>8,000 nucleotides (nt)) of
unknown function that is highly expressed in numerous
healthy organs and overexpressed in metastatic non-small
cell lung carcinomas [27]. Close to MALAT-1 on 11q13.1,
trophoblast-derived noncoding RNA (TncRNA, 44

ORESTES) is a 481 nucleotide (nt), non-protein-coding RNA
involved in trophoblastic major histocompatibility complex
suppression by inhibiting class II transactivator (CIITA) transcription [28]. H19 is a non-protein-coding, maternally
imprinted mRNA (two spliced ORESTES) [29] that is highly
transcribed in extraembryonic and fetal tissues, as well as in
adult skeletal muscle. It has been shown that H19 is involved
in the genomic imprinting of the insulin-like growth factor 2
(IGF2) gene [30]. Moreover, IGF2 is expressed throughout
the epidermis [31] and its overexpression increases the thickness of the epidermis and the proportion of dividing cells in
the basal layer [32]. We suggest that H19 could participate in
the regulation of IGF2 transcription by maintaining the
genomic imprinting of its promoter in adult epidermis. In
addition to numerous protein-coding genes, we thus detected
several non-protein-coding RNAs whose expression in the

epidermis had not been previously assessed, evoking the possibility that they might play a specific role in this tissue.

Real-time PCR expression profiling of selected genes
Genes involved in the establishment of the skin barrier are
expected to be specifically overexpressed by granular
keratinocytes. To compare the expression levels of candidate
genes between the basal layer and GKs, quantitative real-time
PCR experiments were performed with the T4 and T1 cell
fractions. Based on predicted domains and homologies, 73
genes represented by less than 100 ESTs were selected (Table
7). The relative T4/T1 ratio could not be calculated for 20 of
them due to very low expression levels. Ten genes were
equally expressed in the two layers, and nine were overexpressed in the basal layer, even if expressed at a low level in
the granular layer. Interestingly, 33 were overexpressed in
the granular layer with T4/T1 ratios ranging from 6 to 800.
For several genes, the T4/T1 expression ratio was thus much
larger than that observed for the KLK7 gene, used as a specific
marker of the GKs in our cell purification experiments (Table

Main specificity

1). Therefore, these data emphasize the high degree of purity
of the GKs we have purified from healthy human skin. They
also provide one with new, highly specific markers for this cell
type.

Identification of new genes
FLG2
The epidermal differentiation complex (EDC) spans 1.62
megabases on 1q21.3 and contains approximately 50 genes
specifically involved in the barrier function, such as those
encoding involucrin, loricrin, filaggrin, small proline rich
proteins (SPRR1-4) or late cornified envelope proteins
(LCE1-5) (Figure 3a). We cloned many sequences
corresponding to known genes of this locus (Figure 3b), but
also a large number of sequences for a previously poorly
characterized transcript encoding filaggrin 2 (FLG2; also
called ifapsoriasin (IFPS); (GenBank:AY827490)). FLG2 displays features of the fused-family genes (encoding filaggrin,
trichohyalin, or repetin), with three exons and a large predicted protein sequence (2,391 amino acids) containing two

information

Two ORESTES were identified as the human orthologues of
the murine lipases Lipl2 (NM_172837) and Lipl3
(BC031933), previously identified by large-scale mouse
cDNA sequencing by the Riken Institute [33] and the Mammalian Gene Collection program [34], respectively. The corresponding human genes LIPL2 and LIPL3 were clustered in
a 665 kB interval on chromosome 10q23.31 with genes encoding two experimentally characterized lipases, LIPA (lysosomal acid lipase, MIM +27,8000) and LIPF (gastric lipase,
MIM #601980) and two hypothetical lipase-like proteins,
LIPL1 and LIPL4 (Figure 5a). Therefore, our study contributed to the elucidation of a specialized human genomic locus
that includes six lipase genes and four other genes
(ANKRD22, STAMBPL1, ACT2 and FAS) of apparently unrelated function (Figure 5a). In accordance with the Hugo Gene

interactions

calcium binding EF-hand domains and a large domain made
of repeated segments of about 25 amino acids. The amino acid
composition of FLG2 is very similar to that of filaggrin, with a
high content of serine (22%), glycine (20%), histidine (10%)
and glutamine (10%). The expression of this gene is likely
restricted to the epidermis, as shown by PCR on a panel of
cDNAs from 16 healthy human tissues and organs (Figure 4).
Real-time PCR also showed a strong overexpression of the
FLG2 gene in GKs, with a T4/T1 ratio of 800 (Table 7). These
results thus suggest that this gene is a new functional member
of the EDC complex, in agreement with its similarity to the
filaggrin gene, whose function in the epidermal barrier is well
established.

Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), these new hypothetical
lipase genes, LIPL1, LIPL2, LIPL3 and LIPL4, have been
renamed LIPJ, LIPK, LIPM, and LIPN, respectively.

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R107

information

The clustering of six lipase genes on the human 10q23.31
locus led us to examine in detail the syntenic mouse locus
(19qC1), where the orthologous genes except for LIPN and
LIPJ had already been identified or predicted,. Sequence

The human LIPK, LIPM and LIPN genes appear to be exclusively expressed in the epidermis, as shown by PCR on a panel
of 16 cDNAs (Figure 4). Their expression was highly specific
for GKs, with real-time PCR T4/T1 ratios of 100-150 (Table
7). LIPJ expression was also detected in the epidermis by
PCR, but was too weak to allow real-time PCR experiments to
be performed. These results strongly suggest that the LIPK,
LIPM and LIPN genes play a highly specific role in the last

interactions

The conceptual translation of LIPJ, LIPK, LIPM, and LIPN
ORFs led to proteins of 366, 399, 423 and 398 amino acids,
respectively. As is the case for LIPA and LIPF, these proteins
contain an abhydrolase associated lipase region (PFAM
PF04083) with an alpha/beta hydrolase fold domain (PFAM
PF00561). More precisely, they display the characteristic SerAsp-His catalytic triad (Figure 5b) also present in various
hydrolases, such as serine proteases [35,36]. Surprisingly,
LIPJ (NM_001010939) appeared as the only member in this
family to lack a cleavable signal peptide (Figure 5b) and might
thus play a distinct role in human physiology.

refereed research

Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) cloning experiments of the human LIPK mRNA localized the cap site 165 nt
upstream of the conceptual ATG initiation codon. For the
LIPM and LIPN mRNAs, the entire coding sequences have
been cloned using primers deduced from alignments with the
mouse cDNAs (GenBank:EF426482, GenBank:EF426484
and GenBank:EF426483).

analysis showed that the AK154333 cDNA clearly corresponds to the LIPN orthologue (89% homology). As in the
human genome, this gene resides between the Lipl2 and Lipl3
genes. Intriguingly, we could not precisely identify a single
orthologue of LIPJ. Instead, we found upstream of the Lipf
gene a cluster of five predicted genes encoding secreted
alpha/beta hydrolases as well as at least three pseudogenes
containing premature stop codons (Figure 5a). A syntenic
cluster, albeit of smaller size, resides in the rat genome. These
five hypothetical functional mouse lipases form by themselves a separate group in the phylogenic tree (Figure 5c;
Additional data file 4). Their genomic localization suggests
that they could have arisen from a large expansion by tandem
duplications well after the separation of the rodents from the
primate ancestors, or from a lipase gene lost in the human
genome. These five new genes have thus been renamed
Lipdc1-5 for lipase domain containing1-5 in accordance with
the Mouse Gene Nomenclature Committee (MGNC) (Additional data file 5).

step of keratinocyte differentiation. Although highly related,
the LIPJ protein might play a different role, as previously suggested by its lack of a signal peptide.

C1orf81
Six spliced ORESTES corresponded to a totally unknown
gene without mRNA sequences in the databases. We performed RACE experiments and identified 16 exons and 15
introns with canonical splice sites and a consensus
polyadenylation signal (GenBank:DQ983818). In agreement
with the HGNC, we named this gene C1orf81. To date, only 16
ESTs are present in the databases, one from testis and the

others from pooled tissues (Additional data file 1). PCR on a
panel of cDNAs from 16 healthy human tissues and organs
showed that spliced transcripts for this gene are detectable in
most samples (Figure 6a). From its conceptual translation,
the C1orf81 mRNA might encode a 373 amino acid protein.
However, a second ORF was present in another frame that
overlapped the first one by 87 amino acids. This suggested
that a longer protein might be produced by a ribosomal
frameshift mechanism. We explored the C1orf81 gene orthologues in vertebrate genomes, and particularly the region corresponding to the ORF overlap (exons 7-9). Compared with
the C1orf81 gene from 10 other mammals, exon 8 of the

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R107

human gene contained a 1 base-pair insertion that creates the
frameshift (Figure 6b). The possibility of a sequence error in
the present human genome assembly was excluded by
sequencing the exon 8 region from two individuals.
Accordingly, the human C1orf81 gene product would be 373
amino acids long, but 762 and 714 amino acids long in the
chimpanzee and rhesus monkey, respectively. In all cases, the
analysis of the peptide sequence did not reveal known
domains or signal peptide. Further studies are needed to
uncover the role of this new gene in mammalian physiology,
and evaluate the consequences of its possible inactivation in
human.

hybridization-subtraction techniques (for an example, see
[37]).

Discussion

Nevertheless, a few genes were represented by more than 100
sequences obtained from different mini-libraries. These
include ubiquitous, highly expressed genes like RPS8 and
EEF1A1, and genes already known to be highly transcribed in
GKs (those encoding keratin 1, late envelope protein 7 or profilaggrin). Other members of this class, DMKN (formerly
ZD52F10), SERPINA12 and FLG2 were not previously known
to be overexpressed in the skin, and were thus studied in
more detail. Two isoforms of transcripts for the dermokine
gene were previously reported [15,16] and we describe 13
novel mRNA isoforms that are either ubiquitous or epidermis-specific depending upon alternative promoter usage. The
epidermis-specific forms encode secreted proteins of still
unclear function, and are abundantly transcribed in this tissue [17].
SERPINA12, also named Vaspin (visceral adipose tissuederived serine protease inhibitor), is an extracellular serine
protease inhibitor that displays insulin-sensitizing effects
[38]. In addition to the previously documented expression in
the liver, we observed that the SERPINA12 gene is highly
expressed in the human epidermis (Figure 4). Moreover, realtime PCR showed that it is specifically expressed by GKs (T4/
T1 ratio of 50). The Serpin A12 protein might thus play a role
in the regulation of the complex balance between various
proteases and their inhibitors operative in the desquamation
process.

information

A new gene characterized in this study, C1orf81, is particularly intriguing as the corresponding transcript (2,284 nt)
displays an ORF disruption by a human-specific, single nucleotide insertion in the eighth exon (Figure 6b). As a result, a
premature stop codon resides in exon 9, 103 nt upstream of
its 3' end. Consequently, the human C1orf81 mRNA might be
degraded by the nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD)
pathway [39]. This appears unlikely, however, as its
expression in various tissues was detected by RT-PCR (Figure
6a). However, its expression in epidermis was too weak to

interactions

The filaggrin 2 (FLG2; or ifapsoriasin (IFPS)) gene is a new
member of the EDC (chromosome 1q21.3), a cluster of
approximately 50 genes involved in cornification. Our realtime RT-PCR experiments revealed that FLG2 expression displays strong specificity for GK. Interestingly, its composition
is very close to that of filaggrin. The degradation of filaggrin is
considered to be at the origin of the free amino acid pool of
the natural moisturizing factor, which is capable of attracting
and retaining water in the cornified layer to achieve skin softness and flexibility. We suggest that FLG2 might have a similar function.

refereed research

In the present transcriptome project, the ORESTE methodology was selected because it produces sequences that are distributed predominantly within the central part of the
corresponding transcripts and is biased towards less-abundant mRNAs [9]. When using arbitrarily chosen primers for
reverse transcription and PCR, the amplification of a given
transcript is proportional to its length and to the probability
for the primer to anneal at low stringency (37°C). This conceptual normalization was secondarily strengthened by
removing cDNA libraries with highly abundant amplification
products. After the elimination of irrelevant sequences, we
produced 16,591 ORESTES representing 3,387 genes. The
distribution of the ORESTE number per gene (Figure 2) and
the low number of ESTs in the corresponding UniGene
entries fully confirmed that the transcript normalization
obtained with this method is at least comparable to that of

We have described here the first large-scale study of the transcriptome of human epidermal cells. As we are interested in
genes that participate in the barrier function of the skin, we
focused on GKs. They correspond to the ultimate step in the
course of keratinocyte differentiation, and are the last epidermal cells to display gene expression activity before
undergoing a particular programmed cell death leading to
cornification. Because these cells represent less than 10% of
the epidermis population, a preliminary step was to design an
efficient purification method starting from healthy human
skin fragments. After unsuccessful attempts using size filtration, Ficoll gradients, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting,
we used successive short-term enzyme incubations to progressively detach cells from the deep layers, and purify the
cells that remain attached to the cornified layer. These incubations were performed at 4°C to stop cellular metabolic
activity and preserve the mRNA pool from degradation. This
point is highly relevant as many growth factors, cell cycle regulators and transcription factors are encoded by short-lived
mRNA. Quantitative PCR experiments were used to assess
the relative expression levels of several genes in the successive cell fractions.

perform real-time PCR experiments. Our analysis suggests
that the human C1orf81 gene encodes a truncated protein
relative to other mammalian species, including the rhesus
monkey. Nevertheless, we do not exclude the possibility that
the translation of the human C1orf81 mRNA might produce a
full-length protein by a +1 ribosomal frameshift mechanism.
To our knowledge, such a phenomenon has been uniquely
described in human for the ornithine decarboxylase antizyme
gene family [40]. This would thus constitute a further example of a (partial) loss of gene function during hominoid evolution. The systematic comparison of the human and
chimpanzee genomes has revealed nine other human-specific
frameshift mutations (pseudogenization) leading to the
mRNA decay or carboxy-terminal protein truncation [41].
Gene losses that occurred after human-chimpanzee
divergence could play a role in adaptive evolution, as shown
for caspase 12 inactivation during hominization [42]. In this
framework, it is intriguing that a member of the hair keratin
gene complex, KRTHAP1, and a serine protease inhibitor
gene, SERPINA13, are also among the few genes specifically
inactivated in human by a mutation [43,44].
In addition, we sequenced ORESTES for CTAGE5 and
CNOT6L functional retrogenes, which are specific for primate
and hominoid lineages, respectively. Moreover, the CTAGE5
retrogene is included in a larger, human-specific insertion
(data not shown). It is indeed known that new genes have
emerged after a burst of retroposition in primates [45]. Not
surprisingly, this suggests that modifications of genes
expressed in the skin participate in obvious differences
between human and chimpanzee.

Real-time PCR experiments
Real-time PCR experiments were used to measure the relative
expression ratio of selected genes in the T4 (mainly GKs) and
T1 (basal layer) fractions. In initial experiments using the
SCCE/KLK7 gene as a GK specific marker, the T4/T1 ratios
(54-189; Table 1) indicated that the T4 fraction was indeed
highly enriched in GKs. However, subsequent experiments
led to even higher ratios (for example, 800 for FLG2 and
GSDM). Our approach thus led to the discovery of new, exquisitely specific gene markers for GKs that constitute valuable
tools for detailed studies of epidermis architecture by histochemistry and in situ hybridization methods. Moreover, such
highly specific expression strongly suggests that the corresponding genes play key roles in barrier function. The real-

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R107

time PCR studies also revealed equal expression of several
genes in the T4 and T1 fractions, suggesting that they are
transcribed during all steps of keratinocyte differentiation. In
addition to providing one with a highly purified GK fraction,
our human skin fractionation method thus constitutes a new
tool for the characterization of genes involved in the successive steps of terminal differentiation in the epidermis.

GK-specific candidate genes
To further characterize genes poorly represented in databases, the 330 genes with the lowest EST number in the UniGene database (≤100 ESTs) were analyzed in more detail.
Among these, the known specific genes involved in
keratinocyte terminal differentiation account for only 15% of
the panel, whereas 42% (139) encode hypothetical proteins.
This shows that genes expressed specifically in the uppermost
layers of the epidermis are poorly represented in the sequence
databases, and suggests that some genes encoding hypothetical proteins may play a functional role in the late steps of epidermal differentiation. We specially focused on genes
potentially involved in desquamation regulation as well as
lipid metabolism and transport, considering their importance
for barrier function establishment. Thus, 73 candidate genes
were chosen for a quantitative study of their expression in the
course of epidermal differentiation by real-time RT-PCR. The
T4/T1 ratio for 20 of them could not be calculated by quantitative RT-PCR using the SYBR Green method, due to a very
low expression level. This underlines the sensitivity of the
ORESTES method in detecting rare transcripts. Among the
52 remaining genes, real-time RT-PCR experiments revealed
that 33 are upregulated during late epidermis differentiation,
and hypotheses on the function of some of them are presented
below. Moreover, the expression pattern of 6 of these genes is
mostly restricted to epidermis as shown by PCR on a panel of
16 human cDNAs prepared from various organs (Figure 4).
Among the 330 genes poorly represented in EST databases
that we identified, a significant proportion of granular keratinocyte specific genes are thus suspected to be present.

Expression of proteases and protease inhibitors in the
human epidermis
The balance between proteases and protease inhibitors is
essential to desquamation [46]. The inactivation of the protease inhibitor cystatin M/E gene in mice causes lethality and
defects in epidermal cornification [47]. Mutations in the
SPINK5 gene (encoding another protease inhibitor) are

responsible for Netherton syndrome (OMIM #256500), characterized by ichthyosiform erythroderma, bamboo hair and
atopic dermatitis. In this framework, we identified three protease inhibitors potentially involved in desquamation.
In addition to the serine protease inhibitor SERPINA12 discussed above, we identified two other members of the serpin
superfamily, SERPINB7 and SERPINB12, whose expression
in the epidermis is reported here for the first time. Moreover,
our real-time PCR experiments clearly show that these two
protease inhibitors (as well as SERPINA12) are overexpressed in the uppermost epidermal layers. SERPINB7, also
known as Megsin, is deposited in the extracellular matrix by
kidney mesangial cells [48], but its targets have not been
identified to date. SERPINB12 is expressed in many tissues,
and displays inhibitor activity against trypsin-like serine proteases [49]. To understand the roles of these protease
inhibitors in desquamation, it is of key interest to determine
their molecular targets. Proteases expressed in the skin and
potentially involved in desquamation are interesting candidates. Our ORESTES data set includes the serine protease
kallikrein 7 (SCCE), which plays a key function in desquamation by cleaving two corneodesmosome components, desmo-

collin 1 and corneodesmosin [50]. Surprisingly, we did not
detect kallikrein 5 (SCTE), which cleaves another corneodesmosome component, desmoglein 1. However, we
detected for the first time the transcription of the P11 gene in
the epidermis. This gene encodes a secreted serine protease
previously shown to be expressed in the human placenta and
various neoplasms of the breast, ovary, testis, and stomach
[51]. Its specific targets remain unknown. In epidermis, P11 is
upregulated in the granular layer with a T4/T1 ratio of 35
(Table 7). We suggest that P11 could act in the course of desquamation, either by cleaving corneodesmosome components,
or by activating other proteases.
Protease inhibitors might also play a documented role in protecting the body from infection. In addition to the liverexpressed antimicrobial peptide LEAP-2, we detected the
expression of the WAP1 and WAP2 genes, which encode serine protease inhibitors with antimicrobial activity in mouse
tongue and kidney [52]. WAP1 appears to be expressed in all
epidermal layers, whereas WAP2 is overexpressed in GKs and
could thus play an antimicrobial role in uppermost epidermal
layers. Therefore, our study contributes to enlarge the panel
of proteases and protease inhibitors potentially involved in

Genes involved in lipid metabolism

interactions

In addition to the lipases from the 10q23.31 locus, nine additional genes, predicted to be involved in lipid metabolism,
were overexpressed in GKs (Table 8). Their homology with
known genes suggests that they might act on fatty acid
(PNPLA1, THEM5, ADHD9, FAM83F) or ceramide (LASS3,
ASAH3, SMPD3) metabolism. Compared to other tissues,
lipid metabolism in the epidermis presents many distinct
characteristics, as it mainly occurs in the extracellular space.
Extracellular lipids play key roles in the barrier function, particularly in hydrophobicity of the skin surface. Our study thus
unraveled new actors in this particularly important process,
and might shed new light on the etiology of genodermatoses.

Genes of miscellaneous function
In addition to genes involved in protein degradation and lipid
metabolism, we characterized new genes that might be of key
importance in skin function. CASZ1 is a transcription factor
induced during embryogenesis in the course of mesenchyme
differentiation [64]. As its gene targets are presently
unknown, its relatively high expression level in the human
skin (20 ORESTES) calls for detailed functional studies in
this tissue. Finally, eight genes encoding hypothetical proteins without known domains, such as C20orf95, CXorf33, or

information

The extracellular hydrolysis of triglycerides in free fatty acids
and glycerol is essential to stratum corneum hydration [59].
Furthermore, long chain free fatty acids represent 16% of
extracellular lipids, cholesterol esters 15%, and free cholesterol 32% [60]. Triglyceride lipase enzymatic activity has
been detected in the intercellular space of the human stratum
corneum [61], and little is known regarding the metabolism
and extracellular modifications of cholesterol esters. The
LIPK, LIPM and LIPN proteins are most probably secreted
and could thus participate in the establishment of the barrier
function by catalyzing the maturation of extracellular lipids.
The weakly expressed, non-secreted LIPJ protein might play
a distinct role.

The new LIPK, LIPM and LIPN lipide hydrolase genes may
play an essential function in lipid metabolism of the most differentiated epidermal layers, and are thus interesting gene
candidates for genodermatoses of unknown origin. Accordingly, mutations in the CGI58/ABHD5 gene, which encodes a
putative triacylglycerol lipase, are responsible for the
Chanarin-Dorman syndrome, a neutral-lipid storage disease
with ichthyosis [62]. Mutations in the LIPH gene are responsible for a hair growth defect [63]. Both CGI58/ABHD5 and
LIPH proteins resemble the lipases encoded by genes from
the 10q23.31 locus as they include an α/β hydrolase fold, but
they lack the abhydrolase associated lipase region.

deposited research

Phylogenetic studies showed that the LIPJ, LIPK, LIPM and
LIPN proteins are very close to well-characterized members
of the family LIPA and LIPF, both also encoded in the
10q23.31 locus. LIPA is a ubiquitous lysosomal cholesterol
ester hydrolase (EC 3.1.1.13) [54,55], while LIPF is a secreted
triglyceride lipase (EC 3.1.1.3) [56]. Interestingly, both LIPA
and LIPF have a low pH optimum, in agreement with the
acidic pH of the extracellular space in the stratum corneum
[57,58].

The LIPK, LIPM and LIPN, but not LIPJ, gene orthologues
could be identified in several vertebrate species, including
mouse and rat. Surprisingly, a cluster of tandem duplicated
genes encoding new lipases resides in the mouse and rat
genomes, which could eventually increase the lipase repertoire of these species.

reports

Mutations of genes involved in various aspects of lipid metabolism are at the origin of several human genodermatoses
(Table 8), underlying the key interest in the identification of
new, lipid-processing genes expressed in the skin. We identified three new human genes, LIPK, LIPM and LIPN, which
encode proteins containing two characteristic domains, the
α/β hydrolase fold and the abhydrolase associated lipase
region. They furthermore contain the consensus pattern of
the active domain [53], suggesting that they are bona fide
lipase genes (Figure 5b; Additional data file 4). The LIPK,
LIPM and LIPN genes are strongly specific for the epidermis
(Figure 4), and real-time RT-PCR experiments revealed a
highly specific expression in GKs, with T4/T1 ratios >100.

roles in epidermal differentiation remain completely elusive.

Conclusion

We have described an original and efficient method for purifying GKs from healthy human epidermis. It is now of key
interest to adapt this technique to biopsy fragments from
patients suffering from various genodermatoses. The GK is
the last cell type in the skin to display transcription activity
before cornification, and we describe the expression of 3,387
genes, a proportion of which are expressed in GKs in a highly
specific manner. We presume that many of them are important for the establishment of the barrier function, and as such
deserve detailed functional studies. Moreover, we provide the
scientific community with a list of gene candidates for
genodermatoses of unknown origin. In particular, the understanding of complex diseases associated with defects in barrier function, such as psoriasis or atopic dermatitis, might
benefit from identification of new epidermis-expressed genes
located in associated loci. Among the genes described, some
fit with, and even improve, our present knowledge of the barrier function, in particular concerning the fine-tuning of protein degradation and lipid metabolism. The precise function
of the corresponding proteins will be assessed using mouse
models and immunochemistry methods starting from healthy
and pathological human skin. However, many of the genes
described herein, often specifically expressed in GKs at high
levels, encode putative proteins whose functions are totally
obscure but that might well participate in the establishment
of the skin barrier. Incidentally, we characterized a new gene,
C1orf81, which is specifically inactivated or truncated in
humans. Whether this gene loss participated in the establishment of the human species, and thus fits the 'less-is-more'
hypothesis [65] remains a fascinating question. Our study of
the human GK transcriptome thus opens new avenues for
future research in many fields, including the normal functioning of the epidermis, the origin of genodermatoses, and even
the emergence of the human species.

Materials and methods
Skin samples and RNA extraction
Normal human skin was obtained from patients undergoing
abdominal plastic surgery (kindly provided by Professor JP
Chavoin, "Service de Chirurgie Plastique et des Brûlés", Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Rangueil, Toulouse, France)
after informed consent and in accordance with Helsinki principles. Subcutaneous fat was promptly removed and strips of
skin were incubated, epidermis side up, for 1 h at 4°C in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5 mg/ml thermolysin (T7902, Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA). The epidermis was
dissected free of dermis tissue with forceps and rinsed in cold
PBS. Epidermal fragments were either immediately frozen for
total RNA extraction or incubated in 1× trypsin-EDTA solution (25300-054, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 4°C

http://genomebiology.com/2007/8/6/R107

under gentle agitation for 15 minutes. The remaining epidermal fragments were rinsed in cold PBS and incubated in
another trypsin-EDTA solution, while fetal calf serum
(10270098, Invitrogen) was added to the suspended cells
(10% final concentration). After centrifugation, the cells were
frozen as dry pellets. The procedure was repeated twice, leading to three successive fractions of dissociated cells named T1,
T2 and T3. The residual fragments (T4 fraction) were drained
on a gauze compress, frozen and ground to a powder under
liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted from the various cell
batches using the RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Purification of poly(A)+ RNA was always performed
from the T4 fraction of individual patients, using oligo(dT)25tagged magnetic beads according to the manufacturer's
instructions (Dynal, Oslo, Norway). Two rounds of hybridization to the beads were performed. The mRNAs were treated
with DNAse I (Invitrogen) and the absence of genomic DNA
was confirmed by PCR using primers for the corneodesmosin
gene (GenBank: AF03130).

Morphological analysis of epidermis samples
After each trypsin incubation, an aliquot of epidermal fragments was fixed in Bouin's solution, embedded in paraffin,
and sections (10 μm) were stained with hematoxylin-eosin.

Production and analysis of ORESTES
ORESTES production was essentially performed as described
[66]. Purified mRNA (20 ng) was heated 10 minutes at 65°C,
reverse transcribed at 37°C for 1 h with 200 U of Moloney
murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and 10 pmol of an arbitrary selected primer
(18-25 nt) in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction products (1
μl) were amplified by PCR using either the primer used for the
reverse transcription, or a single, alternative arbitrary chosen
primer. The hybridization step of the first PCR cycle was set
at 37°C, while the 35 remaining cycles were performed in
standard conditions with a hybridization temperature complying with the length of the primer (typically 55°C). After gel
electrophoresis, products with predominant bands reflecting
the amplification of highly abundant sequences were not further processed. Smear-like reaction products were gel-purified with a 500 bp cut-off. Mini-libraries were then produced
by T/A cloning of the purified PCR fragments (TOPO-TA
cloning kit, Invitrogen).

Plasmid purification and sequencing
Sequencing was performed by standard procedures (ABI
Prism Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit, Applera, Norwalk, CI, USA) after either plasmid purification (Wizard miniprep kit, Promega) or rolling circle amplification of the
plasmids.

Sequence analysis
An automated protocol for the sequence analysis was used to
verify sequence quality. Sequences were then analyzed using
a stepwise approach. Starting with RepeatMasker [67],

Genome Biology 2007, 8:R107

Genome Biology 2007,

ORESTES were clustered with the PHRAP algorithm [68].
Consensus sequences or singletons were annotated using
BLAST searches against human databases (best-hit among
successively RefSeq, Uniprot and EST_Human databases
[69]). Sequences were also aligned on the human genome
(May 2004 assembly) using BLAT [18] and inserted as a custom track into the UCSC Genome Browser.

We performed 5' RNA ligase-mediated (RLM)-RACE using
the FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA).
Briefly, total RNA was dephosphorylated with calf intestine
phosphatase then decapped using tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to target full-length mRNA. An adapter was then
ligated to mRNA and reverse transcription was performed
using random decamers. PCR was performed to amplify the
resulting cDNA using the Outer 5' RLM-RACE primer and a
gene specific lower primer. Nested PCR was then performed
with the Inner 5' RLM-RACE primer. The RACE nested PCR
products were cloned into the pCRII-TOPO vector using a
TOPO T/A cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced.

For quantitative real-time RT-PCR experiments, all primer
pairs (available upon request) were chosen to generate amplicons of 100-250 bp encompassing different exons, thus
avoiding the amplification of potential contaminating
genomic DNA. The primer sequences were designed using
Primer3 software [70] and BLAST analysis [69] ensured the
absence of similarity to any other human sequence. Reverse
transcription was performed by standard procedures, starting from 100 ng of total RNA of each cell batch and using a
mixture of oligo(dT) and random hexamers. Amplification
assays were performed with the ABI prism 7000 Sequence
Detection System and analyzed with the corresponding software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using the
qPCR ROX-&GO Green mix (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA,
USA). Fluorescence was quantified as Ct (threshold cycle)
values. Samples were analyzed in triplicate, with differences
between the three Ct values lower than 0.3. Expression levels
were calibrated using galectin 7 (LGALS7), or beta-2-microglubulin (B2M) mRNA as internal controls. The differences
between the mean Ct values of the various amplicons and the
reference genes are denoted (ΔCt). The difference between
ΔCt obtained with the indicated cell samples are labeled ΔΔCt;
2ΔΔCt gave the relative level of gene expression between the T1
and T4 fractions. Control wells containing the SYBR Green
PCR master mix and primers without template cDNA emitted
no significant fluorescence after 40 cycles.
