Molecular characterization of vernalization loci
VRN1 in wild and cultivated wheats

Abstract
Background: Variability of the VRN1 promoter region of the unique collection of spring polyploid and wild diploid
wheat species together with diploid goatgrasses (donor of B and D genomes of polyploid wheats) were
investigated. Accessions of wild diploid (T. boeoticum, T. urartu) and tetraploid (T. araraticum, T. timopheevii) species
were studied for the first time.
Results: Sequence analysis indicated great variability in the region from -62 to -221 nucleotide positions of the
VRN1 promoter region. Different indels were found within this region in spring wheats. It was shown that VRN1
promoter region of B and G genome can also contain damages such as the insertion of the transposable element.
Some transcription factor recognition sites including hybrid C/G-box for TaFDL2 protein known as the VRN1 gene
upregulator were predicted inside the variable region. It was shown that deletions leading to promoter damage
occurred in diploid and polyploid species independently. DNA transposon insertions first occurred in polyploid species. At the same time, the duplication of the promoter region was observed in A genomes of polyploid species.
Conclusions: We can conclude that supposed molecular mechanism of the VRN1 gene activating in cultivated
diploid wheat species T. monococcum is common also for wild T. boeoticum and was inherited by T. monococcum.
The spring polyploids are not related in their origin to spring diploids. The spring T. urartu and goatgrass
accessions have another mechanism of flowering activation that is not connected with indels in VRN1 promoter
region. All obtained data may be useful for detailed insight into origin of spring wheat forms in evolution and
domestication process.

Background
Some plants of middle latitudes require vernalization
treatment (a long exposure to low temperatures) to
induce their flowering. This adaptation appeared to protect flower from destruction by cold temperature during
winter. Besides being an important trait for adaptation,
the requirement of vernalization is also of a great agronomical importance. In crops such as common wheat
(Triticum aestivum L.), a vernalization requirement distinguishes winter varieties from spring ones. Spring
growth habit is a potential advantage in cold climates,
with short vegetation season and cold winter, for agriculture which main task is to achieve rich harvest. In
continental middle latitude areas (from 40° to 60° N latitude) the field is occupied for two vegetation seasons by

winter forms and only for one season - by spring ones.
So spring forms allow obtaining two harvests instead of
one of winter growth habit forms, which, moreover, do
not overwinter every year. Due to this reason, the processes underlining vernalization and genes responsible
for this agronomical feature have been of interest for
many years [1]. Increasing knowledge about the molecular genetics of growth habit (spring vs. winter) would
contribute to a better understanding of the evaluation of
adaptation in crops. This data would promote wheat
breeding for specific environments.
In recent years, researchers made some breakthroughs
in understanding of the molecular mechanisms of vernalization in wheat, a plant of prime agronomic importance. Sequences of three vernalization genes VRN1,
VRN2, VRN3 responsible for spring-winter growth habit
have been determine [2-5].
The predicted model shows that the VRN1 gene is
dominant for spring growth habit and it is the main

initiating factor of the flowering regulatory cascade that
is upregulated by VRN3 (similar to Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T, FT) [6]. Whereas VRN2 gene is dominant for winter growth habit, it has been suggested that
mediated protein [7]. In a complementary study, it was
shown that nucleotide polymorphisms or insertionsdeletions on A and D copies of the wheat FT gene can
also explain variations for heading date [8].
Investigation of the photoperiod influence on the regulation of vernalization genes showed that down-regulation of the VRN2 by switching from LD (long day) to
SD (short day) treatment has no effect on the regulation
of VRN1 until plants are transferred again to LD [9].
These data suggest the existence of one more VRN1
repressor.
It has been demonstrated that functional difference
between the dominant Vrn1 and recessive vrn1 alleles in
cultivated diploid T. monococcum L. (genome AbAb) is
due to deletions in the promoter region (near CArGbox) [3]. Vrn-A1 alleles of the common wheat (genome
BBAuAuDD) and the tetraploid T. turgidum L. (genome
BBAuAu) have also nucleotide deletions as well as insertions of mobile elements in VRN1 promoter and large
deletions inside the first intron [10,11]. At the same
time, the dominant Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1 genes are
caused only by large deletions in the first intron [11]. It
is more likely that VRN1 promoter and the first intron
regions contain the regulatory sites for different protein
interactions. CArG-boxes are generally recognized by
MADS-box genes and considered as the critical regulatory site for the response of VRN1 to SD. Recently, this
hypothesis was refuted [12]. However, damages in either
intron or promoter sites are sufficient to accelerate flowering under LD [10,11]. These data suggest the existence
of interactions between these two mechanisms in the
regulation of the VRN1 gene expression.
Most of the wild Triticeae Dum. species have a winter
growth habit, suggesting that the recessive vrn1 allele is
the ancestral feature. In contrast, the majority of cultivated polyploid wheats are spring species [13]. Only
T. aestivum has the similar number of spring and winter
forms http://www.vir.nw.ru and adaptability of landraces
differed depending on their growth habit and VRN genotype [14]. Their growth habit is due to at least one
dominant Vrn1 allele. This allele could be either inherited from ancestral diploids or could result from selection of independent mutations that appeared during the
adaptation to various growing condition after domestication. Moreover, genetic and molecular experiments
show that there are multiple alleles of dominant Vrn1,
and their manifestation in vernalization response is also
different [15,16]. It means that some mechanisms exist,
for which evolutionary background is unknown. In the
present study, molecular variability of wheat VRN1

promoter region was analyzed. In order to get a more
detailed insight into complicated molecular basis of
spring vs. winter growth habit and associated vernalization genes variability, we studied wild and cultivated
wheats together with their close relatives Aegilops L. In
total, 27 accessions of four diploid species (T. urartu
Thum. ex Gandil., T. boeoticum Boiss., T. monococcum
and T. sinskajae A. Filat. et. Kurk.) and 17 accessions of
7 polyploid species belonging to three known sections
(Dicoccoides Flaksb., Triticum, Timopheevii A. Filat. et
Dorof.) were investigated. Seven accessions of goatgrasses belonging to 2 species (Aegilops squarossa L.,
Aegilops speltoides Tausch), which participated in the
hybridization events in polyploidy wheat evolution, were
also studied. Among all 51 investigated accessions, eight
have winter growth habit, and the remaining - spring
growth habit. The number of genes responsible for
spring vs. winter growth habit was estimated in the
genetic experiments for ten spring accessions.

Results
Genetic analysis of growth habit (spring vs. winter)

For the molecular characterization, it was important to
study accessions that possess monogenic control of
spring growth habit. Genetic experiments were carried
out to demonstrate genetic control of growth habit in
some spring wheat and goatgrass species. The obtained
data are given in Tables 1 and 2.
It was established that spring growth habit of most of
examined species was controlled by a single dominant
gene. In the Table 1 the segregation ratio 3 to 1 is reliable while the value of Pierson chi-square test for the
segregation ratio 15 to 1 is higher than the value of significance 3.84. Three investigated tetraploid species were
crossed with near-isogenic test lines, which were characterized with specific dominant Vrn-A1 (i: BS1E), Vrn-B1
(i: BS2E) alleles. The design of near-isogenic lines is
described in Methods section. In crosses with T. dicoccum cv. Black Winter Emmer (BWE), which has recessive vrn-A1 and vrn-B1 alleles, it was shown that spring
growth habit of these species was controlled monogenic,
because the segregation ratio 3 to 1 in F2 generation is
reliable. For T. turanicum (K-15993) monogenic control
was shown indirectly from the next two crosses, where
the digenic segregation (15 to 1) was obtained for all
three species. It means that dominant allele responsible
to spring growth habit is not allelic to Vrn-A1 and VrnB1 alleles of the tested lines.
In tetraploid wheat species, the dominant gene of the
accessions K-15993 and K-16156 was temporarily designated as Vrn-T and their genotypes were specified as
vrn-A1vrn-A1 vrn-B1vrn-B1 VrnTVrnT. It is an
unknown allele, which is nonallelic to Vrn-A1 and to
Vrn-B1. The number and allelity of dominant genes

VRN1 in T. timopheevii (Zhuk) Zhuk. was not determined because all accessions of this species had only
spring growth habit [13]. The generalized information
concerning genetic control of growth habit is represented in Table 3.

Variability at the primer annealing site

In the present work, 27 diploid wheat accessions of four
known species (T. urartu: winter - K-33869, PI538736;
spring - PI428297, PI428197, IG44829, IG45298; T.
monococcum: winter - PI94743; spring - K-20400, K18105, Mute KT3-5, K-20970, PI306540; T. boeoticum:
winter - G1777, K-25811; spring - IG116198, K-14384,
PI428217, IG116196, PI427328, K-20741, IG45296, K40117, K-40118, KU8136, KU8120, KU8059; T. sinskajae: spring - K-48993) and 7 goatgrass accessions of two
species (Ae. speltoides: winter - Ae46593, spring Ae46566; Ae. squarrosa: spring - K-992, K-865, K-608,
K-864, KU2009) were studied (see Material section and
Table 3). Initial PCR screening was provided with primer pair AP1_ProDel_F1, AP1_ProDel_R1 (Table 4).
The PCR product of the expected size of 152 bp has
been obtained in the majority of the studied wheat

accessions and in one goatgrass species, Ae. speltoides
(Fig. 1). No PCR products have been found in Ae. squarrosa accessions. Out of 27 wheat accessions, ten showed
PCR products of the lower size, which can be explained
by deletions in the promoter region.
The heterogeneity of diploid genomes and their sequence
variability was observed previously [17,18]. All available
VRN1 promoter sequences belonging to different wheat
genomes (A, B, D) were extracted from GenBank and
aligned together with primer sequences. There were a 17
bp deletion in D genome near the region complementary
to the reverse primer (AP1_ProDel_R1), and a duplicated
fragment (CCTCAC) near this region in A genome (Fig. 2).
Therefore, a new primer pair was developed (AP1_2F/
AP1_2R) for amplification of D genome. To check for possible minor deviations connected with spring growth habit,
all fragments obtained in PCR using both primer pairs
were directly sequenced. The resulting sequences were
submitted to GenBank: GQ451714-GQ451749.
The presence of the specific deletions in spring wild and
cultivated accessions

Among 22 investigated spring diploid wheats, 9
(T. monococcum: K-18105, T. boeoticum: K-40117, K40118, PI427328, K-20741, IG45296, KU8136, KU8120,
KU8059) had 20 bp or 34 bp deletions in VRN1 promoter

deletions covered the specific area of MADS-box, and
were previously described as associated with spring
growth habit in the diploid cultivated wheat T. monococcum [3,4]. Spring T. boeoticum accessions were not
screened previously as well as T. urartu. Investigation of
the VRN1 promoter mutations in both species may provide important information about mechanisms involved
in the origin of the spring forms in these wild natural
species. Among four spring T. urartu accessions, none
had specific deletions within the VRN1 promoter region
compared to winter forms. However, one accession was
almost identical to the A genome sequences of the polyploid wheats (Fig. 2). This recessive allele was named
vrn-A1u and was not found in all analyzed T. boeoticum
and T. monococcum sequences (Table 3).
The closest relatives of Triticum L. species are Aegilops
L. species, which also have spring and winter forms. In
order to address the question whether flowering initialization in spring goatgrasses has common characters with
that of diploid wheats, we obtained VRN1 promoter
regions from six spring and one winter Aegilops accessions. There were some nucleotide substitutions differentiating goatgrasses from wheats (see additional file 1). No
significant changes, which could distinguish spring and
winter accessions, have been found. All investigated promoter sequences of the Ae. squarrosa accessions contained the specific D genome 17 bp deletion (Fig. 2) and
some D genome specific nucleotide substitutions.

showed a close relatedness of the obtained G genome to

The insertions were 196 bp long in G genome and 127
bp in B genome (Fig. 3). We named these VRN1 promoter variants Vrn-G1a and Vrn-B1a. These insertions
were similar to a 222 bp foldback element (GenBank:

“Spring” (Fig. 4). However, the site of insertion was different. It was not in the place of the CArG box
(CCTCGTTTTGG) and was flanked by another host
direct duplication (HDD - CTCCGCCCC) (Fig. 3).
More detailed analysis of the mobile elements which were
found in Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1 and Vrn-G1 promoter regions of
tetra- and hexaploid wheat species showed the presence of
the terminal inverted repeats (TIR) and predicted open
reading frames between both repeats (Fig. 4). The observed

TIR, could belong to the superfamily Tc1/Mariner.
The VRN1promoter regions from A genomes of
spring tetraploids also contain different promoter
damages and share some variability. In addition, a 50 bp
deletion was found in the region -112 and -62 nucleotide from start codon. This deletion was located in the
same region where the foldback element insertion
occurred in the G genome (Fig. 3). This VRN1 promoter
allele was called Vrn-A1f. Species of the section Dicoccoides, T. turanicum (K-11597) and T. dicoccum
(Schrank) Schuebl. (line BS2E) also had a common 20
bp deletion in the region -156 -136 upstream from the
start codon. This deletion included the repetitive region
and was observed previously in Vrn-A1b and Vrn-A1d
alleles of spring tetraploid T. durum Desf. and T. dicoccoides correspondingly [10]. We observed also a 54 bp
deletion in A genome of T. durum (spring line of cv.
Kristall (Vrn-D4), Odessa) that was similar to Vrn-A1e
alleles of T. dicoccum. VRN1 promoter from A genome
of T. dicoccum (near-isogenic line BS1E - Black Spring
Vrn1 Emmer) displayed identity with Vrn-A1a allele
observed previously in T. aestivum near-isogenic line
Triple Dirk D (TDD) and contained the insertion of a
foldback element.

VRN1-1NT1R

Hexaploid wheat species

Promoter sequences of vrn-A1, vrn-B1 and vrn-D1
alleles from two winter cultivars (Mironovskaya yubileinaya, Mironovskaya 808) and A, B and D genome
sequences of spring mute Mironovskaya yarovaya were
determined. The spring mute was found in cultivar Mironovskaya 808. VRN1 promoter fragments of winter cultivars and B, D genome of spring Mironovskaya
yarovaya contained a common for certain genomes
variability observed in recessive alleles of winter wheat
near-isogenic line Triple Dirk C (TDC) [10]. After cloning and sequencing of A genome fragment of spring
sample, clones with and without specific deletions were
observed. The observed deletions included 8 bp del in
-128 -120 region and 50 bp del in -112 -62 region that
were common for the Vrn-A1f allele described above in
tetraploid species (Table 3, Fig. 3).
Three T. aestivum cultivars Pyrothrix 28, Osijek and
Jupateko with “weak” Vrn1 alleles (low phenotype

manifestation allele) [15] were also included in the
research. No differences from recessive alleles were
found in VRN1 promoter sequences from A, B and D
genomes of spring cvs. Osijek and Pyrothrix 28; as well
as from B and D genomes of spring cv. Jupateko. After
amplification of the VRN1 promoter region from A genome of the cv. Jupateko, two PCR products were visualized on electrophoresis. Sequencing of two larger PCR
products revealed the presence of the foldback element
insertions that was common for VrnA1-a allele [10]. A
222 bp foldback element insertion differed moderately
from those previously described. The site of insertion
and flanking direct repeats (TTAAAAACC) were similar
for both elements. However, analysis of the foldback element of spring cv. Jupateko indicated an absence of
direct repeats inside (Fig. 4). These direct repeats were
the sites of deletions in the duplicated promoter
sequences of Vrn-A1a allele. Therefore, we detected
only one variant of the promoter with mobile element
insertion in this species. The smaller PCR products in
cv. Jupateko had most common character with Vrn-A1f
allele observed in K-38555 T. timopheevii. Thus, two different Vrn-A1 alleles were detected. Both alleles could
be the cause of spring growth habit.
We also found promoter damages in the A genomes
of two other investigated intrageneric T. aestivum: substitution line Saratovskaya/Vietnamskaya 5R(5A) and
line nulli5B-tetra5D Chinese Spring. The investigated
promoter regions contained Vrn-A1b and Vrn-A1f
alleles correspondingly (Table 3). Both alleles could be a
reason of spring growth habit and likely inherited from
tetraploid species during cultivation and breeding
programs.

Investigation of A genome sequences revealed at least
two different variants of VRN1 promoter in some
cloned samples according to the presence of indels. At
the same time all cloned B and D genome sequences
were identical in the presence or absence of indels. To
exclude any doubt in affiliation with a specific genome, we provided the phylogenetic analysis, which
allowed the correlation of each sequence into the genome (see additional file 3). Each of three accessions of
Diccoccoides section (T. turanicum K-11597, K-15993;
T. dicoccum line BS1E) had two different variants of
the promoter in A genome. One of them was intact as
in winter vrn-A1 allele, and another had a deletion or
insertion of the transposon (Fig. 5). VRN1 promoters
of the remaining three examined species (T. dicoccum
line BS2E, T. durum line Kristall (Vrn-D4), T. turgidum K-16156) were sequenced directly without cloning and contain only one variant of sequence judging
from the absence of superpositions in the
chromatograms.

In section Timopheevii four clones of T. araraticum
(K-28244) were similar if indels are taken into consideration. T. timopheevii (K-38555) had four clones similar
to those of T. araraticum (K-28244) containing Vrn-A1f
allele and one clone with intact vrn-A1 allele. Absence
of the previously determined A genome specific 8 bp
insertion in the region -120 -128 were observed in some

clones of the tetraploid species. Only A genome had
variability at this region while B, G and D genomes as
well as genomes of the examined goatgrasses were conservative and had deletions in this place. All obtained
Vrn-A1f allele had no 8 bp insertion.
Seven clones of VRN1 promoter region from A genome were sequenced in tetraploid line discovered in T.

were found. At the same time, no positive result was
obtained in PCR with B/G genome specific primers for
VRN1 promoter region and developed previously for
Acc-1 and Pgk-1 genes [18].
Three spring cultivars of hexaploid T. aestivum also
contain at least two VRN1 promoter variants in A genomes (Fig. 5). VRN1 promoter region of A genome of
cv. Mironovskaya yarovaya and line nulli5B-tetra5D Chinese Spring included the recessive vrn-A1 and the dominant Vrn-A1f alleles. Cultivar Jupateko had in addition
the third allele differed from others by a transposon
insertion.
Predicted regulatory elements inside VRN1 promoter
region

In the present work, we performed the analysis of the
cis-regulatory elements (recognition sites for transcription factors, TF) inside the most variable region of the
VRN1 promoter. This information helps to investigate
the consequences of the damages in the promoter of the
main initiation factor of flowering, and possibly is
related to the mechanism of growth habit changing.
Previously, a specific CArG-box common for all
MADS-box protein family was found in the region
where different in size deletions and transposon insertion occurred in spring diploid and polyploid wheat species. It was suggested that CArG-box could be involved
in the regulation of VRN1 by interacting with other
MADS-box proteins [3]. Our analysis showed that this
region also included recognition site for HMG1, a high
mobility globular protein, with a high probability (error
type I -0.2308, error type II - 0,03882, psum -91, 074,
Fig. 3B). Recently, an increased expression of wheat
homolog HMG1B protein after cold exposure of crown
tissue was showed [19]. The HMGB1 is thought to
interact with histones and could participate in modifying
chromatin structure.

Some other regulatory sites were found in the region
of 20 bp and 50 bp deletions common for Vrn-A1b and
Vrn-A1f alleles, correspondingly (Fig. 3B). We also
observed the recognition site (G/C hybrid box) for bZIP
proteins. The VRN3 (TaFT) protein was shown to upregulate VRN1 expression via interaction with TaFDL
members of bZIP transcription factor family [6,20].
Moreover, it appears that TaFDL2 protein can interact
in vitro with ACGT elements of the promoter of the
meristem identity gene VRN1, including G-box and G/C
hybrid of G- and C-boxes (CACGTC). It is interesting
that both transposon insertions observed in B and G
genomes contain additional G-box motif (CACGTG)
(Fig. 4).
Near the region of the G/C hybrid box we found the
binding motifs for MyoD-like protein, a member of the
bHLH family of transcription factors (error type I -1,
error type II - 5,2e-05, psum -94,4257) (Fig. 3B). Members of the bHLH family in animals have been shown to
regulate the determination and differentiation of a variety of cell types, including skeletal muscle, neurons, and
hematopoietic cells. Recent detailed study into the physical interaction among the bHLH proteins of Arabidopsis that control stomatal development reflected that a
similar mechanism functions in animal muscle and
plant stomata [21,22]. It is known also that markers of
myogenic specification such as MyoD and myogenin
gene, which encode transcription factors of the basic
helix-loop-helix family, interact with proteins belonging
to the MADS-box transcription factors [23]. It is likely
that examined bHLH proteins (myoD-like) modulate
cell cycle regulatory protein activity in a similar fashion
in both animal and plant cells.
A binding motif was also found for GATA1 protein
(error type I -0,1111, error type II -0,00451, psum
-90,1055) (Fig. 3B). GATA transcription factors are a
group of DNA binding proteins broadly distributed in
eukaryotes. Four classes of these proteins are described
in plants [24]. Some GATA transcription factors are
downstream effectors of floral homeotic gene action in

Arabidopsis [25]. It appears that two MADS-box gene
products, APETALA3 (AP3) and PISTILLATA (PI) can
directly interact with two members of GATA transcription factor family. Altogether they regulate a variety of
light and nutrient responsive genes participating into
the transcriptional cascades controlling the specification
of floral organ identities. In particular, APETALA1 gene
(homolog of VRN1 gene in wheat) is directly regulated
by AP3 and PI in Arabidopsis [26].
Transcription factor binding motifs described here are
found in the VRN1 promoter region where indels could
induce flowering without cold treatment. This could
indicate a possibility that wheat homologs of the
HMG1, bZIP, bHLH and GATA1 proteins are involved
in the vernalization response. Further experimental
approaches are necessary to support this suggestion.

Discussion
Triticum genetic material

Notwithstanding the short evolutionary time since the
domestication, some significant morphological changes
were accumulated in cultivated plants. As a result of an
intensive cultivation, many wheat varieties with different
agronomical important characteristics were selected.
However, in many cases the molecular pathway behind
the appearance of a sample with an unusual character in
the stable population is still unknown.
Winter growth habit is assumed to be a more ancestral character than the spring one. It is not known

whether the ancient farmers found spring forms in nature or in their plots. However, they started to cultivate
spring forms intensively. Among the first wheat species
cultivated by people, T. monococcum and T. dicoccum,
most have spring forms according to the last investigation of 284 and 563 accessions correspondingly [13].
The winter forms came back to occupy considerable
areas in the middle latitudes at the beginning of the 20th
century. But in the continental middle latitude areas
(countries like Kazakhstan, Russia, Ukraine, Belorussia,
Canada) the field is occupied by winter forms for two
vegetation seasons and by spring forms - for one season
only. This is due to the agronomical aspects of spring
forms - sowing in spring when winter is too cold. In
these countries it is impossible to use the intermediate
forms, which are used in Southern Europe and Mediterranean region, because of climate, when spring crop can
not survive in winter. It appears that, when both forms
are used, winter ones are often less economically beneficial. For this purpose, mutants with spring alleles of
VRN1 in different genomes (A, В, D) were developed.
Multiple alleles have been described within the VRN1
locus, based on their different effects on vernalization
requirement and flowering time [15,16,27,28]. However,
characterization of these alleles at the molecular level is
necessary. The number of dominant VRN genes in common wheat is important since it modifies spring growth
habit, and allows for the development of commercial
cultivars with different vegetative periods.

Studying the unique collection of spring wild and
domesticated diploid and polyploid wheats not examined before allowed us to observe a greater variability,
especially in tetraploid and hexaploid species. We
described three additional VRN1 promoter variants VrnA1f, Vrn-A1g and Vrn-A1h. Moreover, we showed that
VRN1 promoter region of B and G genomes can also
contain damages such as the insertion of a transposable
element. The duplication of the VRN1 promoter
together with the first exon was also demonstrated.
Inheritance of VRN1 gene from spring wild diploids to
cultivated diploids

It is known that wild diploid wheats were the donors of
A genome in polyploid wheat species. Diploid species
are the most ancient in the Triticum genus so their genome (A genome) has the longest history in the genome
composition of the modern wheat species. The majority
of the wild wheats have a winter growth habit, suggesting that the recessive vrn-A1 allele with an intact VRN1
promoter is the ancestral character. We studied the
number of wild and cultivated diploid species, and
established that VRN1 promoter deletions that resulted
in the elimination of repressor influence in cultivated
species T. monococcum are also common for wild species T. boeoticum. Therefore, it is possible to conclude
that spring forms originated in wild populations and
later were selected by man for culture. New alleles may
result from selection of independent mutations that
appeared during the domestication.
It is likely that a shorter 20 bp deletion appeared first
and then increased to 34 bp deletion. Both variants were
inherited by cultivated diploid forms and could be
inherited also by polyploids.
Species of the genus Aegilops are closely related to
wheats; they have common geographic range, and about
0.5 million years ago a first polyploid wheat appeared as
a result of hybridization of wheats with goatgrasses [29].
Similar to wild diploid spring Triticum species, there are
early-flowering forms among Aegilops species, which
evolved in two intraspecific lineages, Middle Asian and
Transcaucasian [30]. The existence of longitudinal and
latitudinal clines in the onset of flowering at the species
level was observed; however, mechanism controlling
switch from vegetative to generative growth habit is
unknown. To answer the question whether these
mechanisms have common characters with that of
diploid wheats we analyzed VRN1 promoter regions of
several Aegilops accessions. Spring Ae. squarrosa accessions originated from the northern part of Afghanistan
and Iran while in other regions only winter forms were
usually found [31]. However, no indel events were found
inside the investigated region. Therefore, taking into
account the genealogical and ecological framework

Page 11 of 15

complexity of flowering time diversification in the investigated Aegilops accessions we expect the existence of
another regulatory mechanism controlling flowering
time in goatgrass species.
Increasing genetic variability in spring tetraploids within
A, B, and G genomes

In contrast with wild Triticum species, the majority of
cultivated polyploid wheat species have spring growth
habit [13]. Spring forms are due to at least one dominant mutation in VRN1 gene that could be inherited or
appeared independently during domestication or historical selection process.
Four different variants of VRN1 promoter in A genomes of diploid species were observed (Fig. 5). The
main difference between sequences is the presence or
absence of a specific 8 bp deletion that was not
observed only in one spring accession of T. urartu and
inherited by A genome of many polyploids.
In comparison with diploid species three other new
VRN1 promoter variants due to deletions appeared in
tetraploids. One of them represents Vrn-A1e allele and
contains 54 bp deletion in place where specific 20 and
34 bp deletions occurred in diploids. Possibly there was
a deletion expansion in tetraploids but independent
appearance is also likely due to the existence of flanking
direct repeats, which may be the reason of nonhomologous recombination (Fig. 3). There are many different
repeat regions inside VRN1 promoter and most of the
deletions flanked by short direct repeats (Fig. 3). It was
shown that unequal recombination by such repeats can
play the main role in the origin of novel alleles in VRN1
gene [32]. The Vrn-A1e allele could have originated
from the allele containing 8 bp insertion and observed
only in one wild diploid species T. urartu.
Another Vrn-A1b allele found in tetraploids contains a
20 bp deletion (Fig. 3). Its origin is also related to T.
urartu VRN1 promoter containing 8 bp insertion (Fig.
5). The described deletion most likely happened in species of Dicoccoides section. This allele is not found in
wheat species from Monococcon Dum. and Timopheevii
sections. At the same time, Vrn-A1f allele likely
occurred in Timopheevii section within species with G
genomes (Fig. 5). Moreover, its origin is related to
diploid VRN1 promoter containing 8 bp deletion. We
found this allele also in T. turanicum (section Diccocoides); this, however, is likely a case of hybridization
event that may occur between tetraploid species from
different wheat sections.
The VRN1 promoter variant found in T. dicoccum accession (near-isogenic line BS1E) had all common characters
of Vrn-A1a allele as well as the transposon insertion (Fig.
3). Taking into consideration the origin of BS1E line, as the
near-isogenic line of cv. Black Winter Emmer whose vrn-

Golovnina et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:168
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/168

A1 allele was replaced with Vrn-A1a of hexaploid wheat
Triple Dirk (TDD) by backcrossing, this proves its derivation from T. aestivum near-isogenic line TDD.
We found and described also two different alleles in B
and G genomes of tetraploid species that contain a
transposon insertion (Vrn-G1a, Vrn-B1a, Fig. 4). The
indel events in these genomes were observed for the
first time, and both species contained also VRN1 promoter damages in A genomes. Investigated hexaploid
accessions of section Triticum inherited all alleles from
tetraploid species except one with transposon insertion
that most likely happened at this ploidy level (Fig. 5).
Evidence of the VRN1 promoter duplication

In the present work, two and more VRN1 promoter
copies were detected and distinguished by the presence
of indel events within A genome of several spring polyploid species. There are three possible explanations of
these results: (1) nonspecific duplication of different
genomes, (2) heterozygous plant material with two different chromatids in one genome, (3) duplication of the
investigated region. The first possibility was tested by
the presence of the nucleotide substitutions and indel
events specific to different genomes. For more reliable
results the phylogenetic tree was constructed that
demonstrated relatedness of each clone to certain genomes. Results showed an absence of nonspecificity and
supported attributes of each clone to genome which
amplification product was cloned. The genetic experiment and clearance of each examined lines exclude the
second possible case. All accessions with two and more
VRN1 promoter variants contained one intact promoter
that was observed in winter plants. However no splitting
was detected in five generations of each line.
The most likely explanation is the duplication of the
investigated region that occurred in polyploid species.
Previously it was supposed the duplication of the promoter region with the first exon in Vrn-A1a allele [10].
In most cases we found two copies of the promoter that
differed by the presence of deletions. Exceptions were
accessions of T. dicoccoides (PI428276) and cv. Jupateko
of common wheat (Fig. 5).
In most polyploid VRN1 promoter variants, an ancestral form is an intact winter allele found only in T.
urartu accession. The second VRN1 promoter sequences
that was found in diploids and contained 8 bp del was
inherited by some tetraploids of section Timopheevii. In
the genome of ancestor species of this group additional
50 bp deletion occurred.
It is most likely that duplication of the promoter region
occurred before deletion formation and transposon insertion. Moreover, deletions occurred in polyploid species independently from diploid species. Therefore, spring forms,
which resulted from indels, were not inherited from spring

Page 12 of 15

diploid species. The obtained data demonstrated that quite
complicated molecular alterations occurred in the studied
region of spring polyploid species. Two main underlying
causes of such dynamic evolutionary changes seem to be
polyploidy and intensive breeding of agronomic characters.

Conclusions
In the present study we investigated variability in the
promoter region of vernalization gene VRN1 in spring
wheat accessions. A greater variability in the VRN1 promoter region of polyploid species in comparison with
diploid ones was observed. In diploid species, damages
of VRN1 promoter leading to spring growth habit were
inherited by cultivated forms from the wild. A complicated evolutionary process including duplication of
VRN1 promoter was found in A genome of polyploids.
Different indel events likely occurred in spring polyploid
species independently from spring diploid species. Specific transposon insertions found in A genome as well as
in B and G genomes of spring tetraploid species pointed
to active transposition in polyploid genome. Some transcription element binding sites were observed in silico
in the regions of indel events.
Methods
Plant materials

The wheat accessions, goatgrasses and rye were received
from the different genebanks of Russia, Japan, the USA
and ICARDA (Syria, Table 3). In the present work all
used accessions were grown, and their generic definitions and growth habit (spring vs. winter) were determined. The botanical names of wheat species and their
genomic formulas are given according to Goncharov
(2002, 2009) [33,34]. VRN1 promoter sequences of 27
accessions belonging to four diploid wheat species
(T. urartu, T. boeoticum, T. monococcum and T. sinskajae), seven goatgrass accessions belonging to Aegilops
speltoides and Ae. squarrosa (syn. Ae. tauschii) together
with 17 accessions of seven polyploid species belonging
to three known sections (Dicoccoides, Triticum, Timopheevii) were studied. Their accession numbers, phenotypes and genotypes are given in Table 3.
Greenhouse and genetic experiments

In the first experiment, the growth habits of di-, tetraand hexaploid wheat species were investigated. Growth
habit was analysed by spring sowing avoiding even partial vernalization. Three months after sowing in the
field, when all the spring standard varieties had already
headed, experimental materials were classified as spring
(ear emergence) or winter (no visible ear formation).
To identify the VRN genotype and the number of
dominant genes in diploid and tetraploid wheat segregations in the F 2 hybrids were scored according to

Golovnina et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:168
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/168

Goncharov (2004) [35], i.e. three months after sowing,
when all the standard spring cultivars had already
headed, and when it was possible to classify the hybrid
plants as spring (ear emerged) or as winter (no visible
ear formation). Emasculation of mother plant spikes was
performed for producing F1 generation plants and they
were pollinated by flowering father plant spikes using
twirl-method. The segregation ratio for each cross was
determined and compared with the expected segregation
ratio using the Pierson chi-square test. Ten spring
diploid accessions (T. boeoticum -IG116196, IG116198,
K-20471, IG45296; T. monococcum - Mute KT3-5, T.
sinskajae - K-48993, Ae. squarossa, - K-992, K-608, K865, KU2009) and three tetraploid species (T. turgidum
- K-16156, T. durum cv. Kristall, T. turanicum - K15993) were studied in genetic experiments. Since allelism test was impossible between diploid species and
polyploid species, only the number of dominant genes
was determined for diploids.
In the second experiment we produced the near-isogenic lines based on a Black Winter Emmer T. dicoccum
accession with dominant Vrn genes introgressed from
near-isogenic lines of common wheat cv ‘Triple Dirk’ to
analyse the growth habit and VRN genotype in tetraploid wheats [36]. They allowed to carry out methodical
experiments and, later, to study allelism of dominant
genes of common and tetraploid wheats.
In total, among 43 spring accessions for 10 of them
the number of genes responsible for spring vs. winter
growth habit and Vrn genotype for three tetraploid species were estimated in the present study, for 13 spring
wheat and goatgrasses Vrn genotype and a number of
dominant genes were known from previous works.
It was shown previously that all winter wheat had no
deletions in the VRN1 promoter region [3,10]. The VRN1
promoter region of winter mPI306547 accession is available from Genbank (DQ146423). VRN1 promoter
sequences of two other winter accessions (T. urartu - K33869, T. boeoticum - K-25811) from our genetic experiments together with some another were investigated in
the molecular part of the study for their comparison.
Total DNA isolation, primer design, PCR amplification,
cloning, DNA sequencing

The total DNA was isolated from 50-170 mg of acrospires using a standard CTAB method [37]. DNA were
checked by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel containing
ethidium bromide (0.5 mg/mL) in 1xTAE. Primer pairs
used in the study are presented in the Table 4.
Selection of the appropriate oligonucleotide sequences
was provided with the help of Vector NTI Suite 9.0 program [38]. All PCR reactions were performed in a volume
of 20 μl containing 65 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.9), 16 mM
(NH4 )2 SO4 , 1.5 mM MgCl2 , 10% DMSO, 200 μM of

each dNTP, 0.5 μМ of each primer, 20-50 ng genomic
DNA template, and 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase. The
touch-down PCR program had an initial strand separation
step at 94°C for 3 min followed by 15 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 65°C with delta RT-1°C
in each cycle for 30 s and elongation at 72°C for 40 s; after
that, similar 25 cycles with annealing temperature 50°C.
The PCR products were analyzed in agarose gel electrophoresis, extracted from gel with a Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagene; according to manufacturer’s protocol)
and either sequenced directly or cloned into pCR 4-TOPO
TA vectors (Invitrogen) and then sequenced using M13
primers. 200 ng of the PCR product was used in a 10 μl
cycle sequencing reaction with the ABI BigDye Terminator Kit on an ABI 377 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems, http://www.appliedbiosystems.com). The obtained
sequences were deposited to GenBank (Table 3).
Allelic variation at the VRN1 promoter region in diploid
and polyploid wheats

In the present work, VRN1 promoter sequences of wild and
cultural diploid and polyploid wheats with different alleles
were investigated to elucidate variability and possible evolution of promoter damages leading to growth habit change.
PCR screening of diploid wheat was provided with primer
pairs AP1_ProDel_F1/AP1_ProDel_R1 and AP1_2F/
AP1_2R (Table 4). The expected PCR products were about
152 bp and 200 bp long. Using previously developed primer
pairs specific for amplification of different genomes we analyzed A, B, G and D genomes of 17 tetra- and hexaploid
wheats from three different sections (Table 3). Some of the
PCR products were sequenced directly. Others products
were cloned into a plasmid vector, and then three to five
individual clones were sequenced for each sample. The
length of the obtained fragments varied from about 700 bp
for A genome to about 1200 bp for B genome sequences.
Most of the obtained sequences contained genome-specific
substitutions and indels. All sequences were deposited in
the GenBank: diploids - GQ451714-GQ451749; polyploids
- GQ451750-GQ451822, GQ482969-75. Spring accessions
were compared with winter ones; their important differences are described below.
Variability of different clones inside A genome

For some polyploid accessions, PCR products of the
VRN1 promoter region were cloned into a plasmid vector, and individual clones were sequenced. In most cases,
cloning was performed for accessions where unreadable
chromatograms were obtained after direct sequencing.
All PCR products of studied diploids were successfully
directly sequenced. Therefore, the problem could occur
due to the polyploidy or the presence of different promoter variants in one genome of polyploid species [10]. It
turned out that variability between different clones was
sometimes quite high (Table 3). Based on the specific

nucleotide substitutions, it was possible to distinguish
between different genomes of polyploid species.

proofreading. The partial financial support of this investigation was provided
by the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (Grant №09-04-01382-а).

Sequences and phylogenetic analysis

1

The nucleotide sequences were aligned using ClustalW
[39] and improved by MUSCLE algorithm in UGene
software http://ugene.unipro.ru edited using the GenDoc
Version 2.6.002 [40]. The phylogenetic analysis was performed in the MEGA 4.0 program based on all obtained
sequences of the different clones from polyploid wheat
(GQ451750-93, 95-99; GQ451800-19). Sequences of the
different genomes of winter T. aestivum TDC line
(AY747600, AY747604, AY747606) were used as a control, and vrn-H1 sequence of Hordeum vulgare cv. Strider, as an outgroup (AY750993) [41]. Statistical support
for the tree was evaluated by bootstrapping [42].
Regulatory sites analysis

The UniPro Ugene software was used for searching and
analysis of repeat and regulatory elements. The integrated
plugin Sitecon was used for TF site recognition. This tool
was developed for detecting conservative conformational
and physicochemical properties in transcription factor
binding site alignments and for site recognition [43].
