Abstract
Background: The majority of human non-protein-coding DNA is made up of repetitive sequences, mainly transposable
elements (TEs). It is becoming increasingly apparent that many of these repetitive DNA sequence elements encode gene
regulatory functions. This fact has important evolutionary implications, since repetitive DNA is the most dynamic part
of the genome. We set out to assess the evolutionary rate and pattern of experimentally characterized human
transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) that are derived from repetitive versus non-repetitive DNA to test whether
repeat-derived TFBS are in fact rapidly evolving. We also evaluated the position-specific patterns of variation among TFBS
to look for signs of functional constraint on TFBS derived from repetitive and non-repetitive DNA.
Results: We found numerous experimentally characterized TFBS in the human genome, 7–10% of all mapped sites,
which are derived from repetitive DNA sequences including simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and TEs. TE-derived TFBS
sequences are far less conserved between species than TFBS derived from SSRs and non-repetitive DNA. Despite their
rapid evolution, several lines of evidence indicate that TE-derived TFBS are functionally constrained. First of all, ancient
TE families, such as MIR and L2, are enriched for TFBS relative to younger families like Alu and L1. Secondly, functionally
important positions in TE-derived TFBS, specifically those residues thought to physically interact with their cognate
protein binding factors (TF), are more evolutionarily conserved than adjacent TFBS positions. Finally, TE-derived TFBS
show position-specific patterns of sequence variation that are highly distinct from random patterns and similar to the
variation seen for non-repeat derived sequences of the same TFBS.
Conclusion: The abundance of experimentally characterized human TFBS that are derived from repetitive DNA speaks
to the substantial regulatory effects that this class of sequence has on the human genome. The unique evolutionary
properties of repeat-derived TFBS are perhaps even more intriguing. TE-derived TFBS in particular, while clearly
functionally constrained, evolve extremely rapidly relative to non-repeat derived sites. Such rapidly evolving TFBS are
likely to confer species-specific regulatory phenotypes, i.e. divergent expression patterns, on the human evolutionary
lineage. This result has practical implications with respect to the widespread use of evolutionary conservation as a
surrogate for functionally relevant non-coding DNA. Most TE-derived TFBS would be missed using the kinds of sequence
conservation-based screens, such as phylogenetic footprinting, that are used to help characterize non-coding DNA. Thus,
the very TFBS that are most likely to yield human-specific characteristics will be neglected by the comparative genomic
techniques that are currently de rigeur for the identification of novel regulatory sites.

Background
The vast majority of the human genome is made up of
non-protein-coding sequences [1,2], and the specific
function of such DNA is often unknown. As of late, elucidating the functional relevance of the non-coding fraction
of the human genome has become a major priority for
computational and functional genomics [3].
Most of the non-protein-coding fraction of the human
genome is made up of repetitive DNA sequences, primarily transposable elements (TEs), which alone make at
least 45% of the genome. In one sense, these TEs can be
considered as genomic parasites that exist solely by virtue
of their ability to out-replicate the host genome in which
they reside [4,5]. On the other hand, it has become abundantly clear that, once established in a genome, TEs can
contribute to genome function in a number of different
ways [6]. For instance, TEs are known to donate a wide
variety of gene regulatory sequences to the human
genome [7-9], and TE-derived regulatory sequences exert
diversifying effects on the expression patterns of adjacent
genes (reviewed in [10-12]).
TE-derived regulatory sequences are particularly interesting from an evolutionary perspective because of their
potential to drive gene expression divergence between
species. The potential for TEs to cause regulatory changes
between evolutionary lineages is related to the fact that
TEs invariably represent the most rapidly changing, lineage-specific part of eukaryotic genomes. For instance,
when the human and mouse genomes sequences were
compared, it became apparent that 99% of protein coding
genes had human-mouse homologs, with 80% having
direct 1:1 orthologs, whereas only 13% of mouse and
48% of human TEs were shared between the two species
[13]. TE dynamics can even lead to substantial differences
between genomes over relatively short evolutionary time
scales. Indeed, the human evolutionary lineage has experience a TE-driven genome expansion of 500 Mb in the
last 50 million years and 30 Mb since the divergence from
chimpanzees [14].
Taken together with their ability to donate regulatory
sequences, this lineage-specific character of TEs suggests
that the regulatory elements they donate may lead to species-specific differences in gene expression. In fact, a primate-specific endogenous retroviral element has been
shown to donate an enhancer that confers a distinct
parotid-specific expression pattern on the human amylase
gene [15]. A more recent genome scale analysis showed
that TE-derived human regulatory sites are associated with
genes that have increased tissue-specific expression divergence between human and mouse [16]. A corollary prediction of this model for the diversifying regulatory effects
of TEs is that TE-derived regulatory sequences will have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/226

anomalously rapid evolutionary rates. Consistent with
this expectation, we previously found that TE-derived
human transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) are much
less likely to have orthologs in the mouse genome than
non-repetitive TFBS [17].
In this study, we set out to assess the relative evolutionary
rates and the position-specific patterns of variation for
human TFBS that are derived from repetitive versus nonrepetitive DNA. We relied on the analysis of experimentally characterized TFBS that can be unambiguously
mapped to the human genome in order to determine their
evolutionary origins in repetitive or non-repetitive DNA.
Our results suggest that TE-derived TFBS show both rapid
evolution and, in some cases, anomalous position-specific patterns of change relative to non-repetitive TFBS.
Despite these distinct evolutionary characteristics, the TEderived TFBS do show sequence divergence patterns that
are consistent with the conservation of function.

Results and Discussion
Human TFBS from repetitive DNA
A total of 2,521 experimentally characterized human TFBS
were taken from the TRANSFAC database [18] and 1,810
of these were able to be precisely mapped to the latest
build of the human genome reference sequence. Mapping
of TFBS was done using the program site2genome, which
facilitates unambiguous mapping of TFBS by using the
longer flanking sequence context surrounding the relatively short binding sites [19]. The genomic locations of
these human TFBS were compared to the locations of
repetitive DNA sequences identified with the RepeatMasker program [20]. A total of 182 (10%) mapped human
TFBS are co-located with repetitive DNA elements, and
121 (6.7%) of these are contained completely within
repeats (Table 1). 62 of the TFBS derived completely from
repeat regions are associated with TEs, while 59 are
derived from simple sequence repeats (SSRs). SSRs are
short tandem repeats consisting of repeated runs of exact
or nearly exact k-mers, where k = 1–13 bp for microsattelites or k = 14–500 bp for minisatellites [1]. A lower percentage of the SSR co-located TFBS (57%) are found to
completely overlap with the repeats compared to TEderived TFBS (78%), suggesting that some of the SSRderived TFBS identified here may represent ascertainment
artifacts.

Human TEs can be characterized into specific classes/families, and the class/family-specific counts of TE-derived
TFBS are shown in Table 1. The observed distributions of
TE-derived TFBS across classes/families, relative to their
expected distributions based on the genome frequencies
of the TE classes/families, are shown in Figure 1. The
human genome has experienced a number of successive
waves of TE expansion, and accordingly, different TE fam-

ilies have distinct evolutionary ages [1]. For short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) and long interspersed
nuclear elements (LINEs), relatively older families, such
as MIR and L2, encode more TFBS than expected based on
their genome frequencies, while proportionally fewer
TFBS are derived from younger element families such as
Alu and L1. The relative enrichment of TFBS encoded by
older TE families is consistent with the action of purifying
selection based on their regulatory function. In other
words, these older elements are likely to have been preserved in the genome because of the regulatory sequences
that they provide as was predicted by Silva et al. [21].

Evolutionary sequence conservation of repeat-derived
TFBS
Levels of evolutionary sequence conservation between 17
vertebrate species were compared for TFBS with origins in
repetitive versus non-repetitive DNA (Figure 2). TEderived TFBS are by far the least conserved of the three categories, followed by SSR-derived and then non-repetitive
TFBS. All differences between these categories are highly
statistically significant (110>t>19 0 = P < 9e-47). This pattern of low sequence conservation for the TE-derived TFBS
is consistent with the prediction of our regulatory divergence model that TEs are prone to provide rapidly evolving, lineage-specific TFBS.

Having shown the high levels of sequence divergence for
TE-derived TFBS, it is worth noting that evolutionary conservation is often taken as a measure of functional relevance. For instance, the phylogenetic footprinting
approach identifies highly conserved regulatory
sequences as more likely to be functional [22,23]. While a
number of functionally relevant TE-derived sequences
have recently been identified by virtue of their sequence
conservation [24-28], the relatively unconserved TEderived TFBS revealed by our analysis would almost certainly be overlooked by phylogenetic footprinting methods. However, the TFBS that we analyzed were
experimentally characterized, not predicted, and are thus
quite likely to represent bona fide functional regulatory
elements. In fact, the analysis of the relative evolutionary
rates for different positions in the TFBS described below
demonstrates that the specific pattern of conservation
across sites supports the assertion that the TE-derived
TFBS are functional.
TRANSFAC annotations in the site table represent individual residues in TFBS with either upper-case or lower-case
letters. The upper-case residues correspond to specific
sequence motifs within the site that were emphasized by
the authors of the cited literature. We consider upper-case
residues to be more likely to form specific DNA-protein
contacts. Accordingly, the upper- and lower-case TRANSFAC annotations were used to partition TFBS residues into
putative 'contact' positions, which are thought to physically interact with transcription factors (TF), versus 'context' positions that make up the rest of the site.
Presumably, putative contact positions are more functionally relevant than context positions, i.e. a change of
sequence at a contact position would have more of an
effect on TF binding than a change at a context position
would. If this is indeed the case, then according to the
phylogenetic footprinting rationale, contact positions
should be more conserved than context positions. This
prediction is confirmed for all three categories of TFBS
seen in Figure 2, and all differences between conservation
levels for contact versus context positions within categories are statistically significant (7.5>t>3.0 8.4e-11<P <
2.5e-3). In other words, although TE-derived TFBS do
evolve more rapidly than the other categories of TFBS, the
position-specific patterns of TE-TFBS sequence divergence
are nonetheless consistent with selective constraint based
on their regulatory function.
Evolutionary conservation rates for contact and context
positions were further broken down for the different
classes/families of TEs (Table 2). These data reveal several
noteworthy trends. There are substantial differences in the
level of conservation among classes and families. For
instance, it is not surprising that the evolutionarily young
Alu family of elements has the least conserved TFBS, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/226

the young L1 family is similarly less conserved than the
other older LINEs. One unexpected finding was the fact
that TFBS derived from the long terminal repeats (LTRs) of
endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are the most conserved of
all TE-derived TFBS. This observation stands out because
ERVs are also evolutionarily young and not expected to be
conserved. When this finding is considered together with
the fact that LTRs are the only young class (or family) of
TEs that has more TFBS than expected based on their
genome frequencies (Figure 1), it suggest that LTRs may
be particularly prone to donating regulatory sequences to
the human genome. Indeed, LTRs are known to encode
strong promoters, and there are a number of known cases
where LTR-derived promoters control the expression of
adjacent genes [29-33].
Another relevant point from the class/family specific evolutionary conservation data is the fact that the relative
rates of contact versus context TFBS position divergence
are consistent across all categories observed (Table 2). The
greater conservation of contact positions is seen for even
the least conserved Alu family (t = 4.76 P = 2.7e-6). This
indicates that the signal of functional constraint on TEderived TFBS holds irrespective of the age of the elements
from which the TFBS are derived, and serves as an independent confirmation of the experimental evidence in
support of their identification.
Position-specific variation patterns for TE-derived TFBS
The results described in the previous section indicate that
TE-derived TFBS show a low level of evolutionary conservation but a pattern of change that is consistent with their
functional relevance as gene regulators. We used a probabilistic analysis of the position-specific patterns of
sequence variation across TFBS sites to better understand
the relative modes of evolution for non-repetitive versus

TE-derived TFBS. To do this, position frequency matrices
(PFMs) were taken from the TRANSFAC database for five
TFBS where there was at least one TE-derived site in the
human genome along with multiple non-repetitive TFBS.
The PFMs summarize the collection of all experimentally
characterized instances of that TFBS in the genome by representing the counts of each DNA residue (A, T, C or G) at
each site in the TFBS (Figure 3). The PFMs can in turn be
used to derive position weight matrices (PWMs), which
are probabilistic representations of the position-specific
nucleotide composition of the TFBS. The PWMs are represented as sequence logos [34], where the probabilities of
observing a given residue at positions along the TFBS are
indicated with the height of the residue symbols (Figure
3). We used these PWMs to score TE-derived versus non
TE-derived TFBS sequences in terms of how well their specific sequences match the probabilistic model representing all other experimentally characterized sequences of
that TFBS. The scoring was done using a 'leave-one-out'
approach whereby each TFBS was scored using a PFM that
does not include counts derived from the same TFBS. The
TE-derived and non TE-derived sequence scores were
compared to distributions of scores for three distinct simulated sets of 1,000 TFBS sequences. The first set of simulated TFBS sequences – 'genome-random' – was built by
randomly drawing residues at each position of the TFBS
based on their genome frequencies. The second set –
'repeat-random' – was generated from randomly sampled
sequences, of the same length of the TFBS under consideration, taken from members of the same TE subfamily as
the TE-derived TFBS being compared. Finally, the 'matrixrandom' set was simulated according to the position-specific probabilities of the PWM for that TFBS.
An example of this kind of analysis can be seen for an Aluderived TFBS (TRANSFAC site R08639) that sits just
upstream of the FOS-like antigen (FOSL1)-encoding gene
on human chromosome 11 (Figure 4). This TFBS was
identified by virtue of its interaction with the beta-catenin-T cell-factor/lymphoid-enhancer-factor complex
(Tcf/Lef) [35]. In that same study [35], binding of Tcf/Lef
to FOSL1 and C-JUN was implicated in the progression of
colon carcinoma. Interestingly, both FOSL1 and C-JUN
are part of the AP-1 transcription complex suggesting that
this Alu-derived TFBS may be involved in a cascade of regulatory interactions.
The particular TRANSFAC PFM model that corresponds to
this Alu-derived site is M00671, and the binding factor for
this model is the T-cell-specific transcription factor 4
(TCF-4 aka TCF7L2). The PFM and derived PWM that correspond to the M00671 model are shown in Figure 3. This
PWM was used to calculate scores for sets of genome-random, repeat-random and matrix-random sequences (Figure 5A). The Alu-derived and the non-repetitive TFBS were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/226

scored using PWMs built from M00671 PFMs that do not
include residue counts from the particular TFBS being
scored, i.e. using the leave-one-out method (Figure 5B). As
could be expected, the genome-random and repeat-random simulated TFBS sequences have lower scores than do
the matrix-random simulated sequences (Mann-Whitney
U test P = 3.7e-5). What is more relevant is the fact that all
of the experimentally characterized TFBS have scores that
fall within the range of the matrix-simulated sequences
and are much higher than either the genome-random or
repeat-random scores (Table 3). This includes the Aluderived TFBS, which scores significantly higher than the
average scores for the genome-random and repeat-random sites (Mann-Whitney U test P = 1.9e-3). In other
words, the Alu-derived TFBS has a position-specific DNA
sequence profile that much more closely resembles the
non TE-derived sites than it resembles random genomic
sequences or random Alu sequences of the same subfamily. However, the Alu-derived site does have a lower
score than all of the other non TE-derived sites. This indicates that there is still something unique about the TEderived site relative to the non TE-derived sites. Thus, the
position-specific profile of the Alu-derived TCF-4 binding
site shows the hallmark of being functionally active yet
retains a unique character relative to the non TE-derived
sites that bind the same factor. The four other sites analyzed here show similar patterns in that they are clearly
non-random, i.e. they score higher than the genome-random and repeat-random sets, and thus appear to be functional (Table 3). For the p53 matrix (M00761) Androgen
receptor matrix (M00962), the TE-derived sites score
lower than the non-repetitive sites; the two other cases
show TE-derived sites with higher average scores than the
non-repetitive sites. However, these differences are not
statistically significant, indicating that TE-derived TFBS
have position-specific profiles that are indistinguishable
from non-repetitive TFBS. This is consistent with the fact
that we started with experimentally characterized TFBS
and underscores the functional relevance, and similar
position-specific evolutionary constraints, of these TEderived TFBS.

Conclusion
There are numerous experimentally characterized TFBS in
the human genome (7–10%) that are derived from repetitive DNA indicating a pronounced effect of repetitive
DNA on human gene regulation. TFBS that originate from
repeats evolve more rapidly than non-repetitive TFBS but
still shown signs of sequence conservation on functionally critical residues due to purifying selection. Positionspecific patterns sequence variation observed for TEderived TFBS, in terms of the specific nucleotide composition along the positions of the TFBS, also point to divergence in the face of functional constraint. These findings
are consistent with the notion that TFBS originating from

Methods

The evolutionary conservation levels for human TFBS
were determined based on complete genome sequence
alignments [37] between the human genome and 16
other vertebrate genomes [38]. These alignments have
been analyzed, along with the phylogenetic tree of the
species, by the program phastCons [39] to make predictions of discrete conserved genomic elements and to produce conservation level scores for each position (base) in
the human genome. The base-by-base conservation level
scores range from 0 to 1 and represent the posterior probability of every individual position in the genome being in
a conserved element. Base-by-base conservation level
scores were taken across all positions of the mapped TFBS
and then averaged for the different categories compared in
Table 2 and Figure 2.

Experimentally characterized human transcription factor
binding sites (TFBS) were retrieved from the Professional
release 11.3 (9/10/07) of the TRANSFAC database [18].
These TFBS were mapped to the July 2003 human reference sequence [1] (National Center for Biotechnology
(NCBI) Build 34 or hg16) using the program site2genome
[19]. For many individual TFBS, TRANSFAC annotations
list GenBank accessions that provide longer flanking
sequence context for the relatively short TFBS contained
within the sequence. Site2genome uses this flanking
sequence context to allow for one-to-one TFBS-to-genome
mapping. Only TFBS that could be unambiguously
mapped to the human genome sequence (1,810 out of
2,521) were taken for further analysis, and these TFBS
mappings were transferred to the current human genome
build (NCBI Build 36 or hg18) using the UCSC Genome
Browser [36] 'liftover' utility. The locations of human
TFBS were compared to the locations of repetitive DNA,

Site-specific variation scores for TE-derived versus non-repetitive TFBS
Site-specific variation scores for TE-derived versus non-repetitive TFBS. (A & C) Frequency distributions of scores
for 1,000 simulated genome-random sequences (pink), repeat-random sequences (green) and matrix-random sequences (blue)
for the M00671 matrix representing the TFBS bound by TCF-4 (A) and the M01037 matrix for TFBS bound by GLI1 (C). (B &
D) The matrix-random score distributions are compared to the scores for individual TFBS derived from TEs (red) versus the
non-repetitive TEs (gray). Data are shown for M00671 TCF-4 (B) and M01037 GLI1 (D).

resented with upper-case and lower-case residues. The
upper-case TFBS residues correspond to specific sequence
motifs within the site that were emphasized by the
authors of the cited literature. We consider upper-case residues to be more likely to form specific DNA-protein contacts than lower case residues. Accordingly, the upper- and
lower-case TRANSFAC annotations were used to partition
TFBS residues into putative 'contact' positions, which are
thought to physically interact with transcription factors
(TF), versus 'context' positions. TFBS were also divided
into those derived from repetitive, TE and SSR, versus
non-repetitive classes and average conservation scores
were determined for each TFBS class over each residue
(contact and context) class. The statistical significance of
the differences between average evolutionary conservation levels was evaluated using the Students' t-test.

The PWMs were used compute scores (S) individual
observed and simulated TFBS according to the formula:
n

S=

∑ ln W

r ,i

i =1

where Wr, i = the weight of the observed residue r at position i and n = the number of sites in the TFBS PWM. Individual TFBS from the TRANSFAC site table were scored
using the leave-one-out method whereby matrix-specific
PFMs were iteratively built without residue counts from
the particular TFBS being scored. Scores (S) were compared for individual TE-derived and non-repetitive TFBS
along with the score distributions for simulated sets of
matrix-random and genome-random sites.

Authors' contributions
Analysis of the site-specific pattern of TFBS evolution was
done using probabilistic models of TFBS that were computed based on a previously described protocol [40]. Position frequency matrices (PFMs), which represent the
counts of each of the four DNA residues (A, T, C and G) in
each position of a TFBS model, were downloaded from
TRANSFAC 10.3. PFMs were converted into positionweight matrices (PWMs), which represent the probability
(p) of observing each DNA residue (r) at each position (i)
in a TFBS according to the following formula:

c +s
p r ,i = r ,i r
n +4*s r
where cr, i = counts of residue r at position i, sr is a pseudocount function = 1, and n = the total number of TFBS used
to build the model. These probabilities (pr, i) are normalized by the background genome frequencies of the DNA
residues (pr) to compute weights (W):
Wr, i = pr, i/pr
The PWMs are represented as sequence logos [34], which
were built from the collections of TFBS sequences provided by the TRANSFAC matrix database, using the program WebLogo [41]. PWMs were used in Monte-Carlo
simulation to build test sets of 1,000 TFBS sequences, the
so-called 'matrix-random' sequences. For this procedure,
DNA residues at each position of a TFBS were drawn at
random according the site-specific probabilities of its
PWM. 'Genome-random' simulated sets of 1,000 TFBS
were built by randomly drawing residues across site positions according to their background genome frequencies.
'Repeat-random' simulated sets of 1,000 TFBS were generated by randomly sampling sequences of the same length
of the matrix from members of the same repeat (TE) subfamily that the particular TE-derived TFBS was derived.
