Abstract
Background: The wild grass species Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium hereafter) is
emerging as a new model system for grass crop genomics research and biofuel grass biology. A draft
nuclear genome sequence is expected to be publicly available in the near future; an explosion of
gene expression studies will undoubtedly follow. Therefore, stable reference genes are necessary
to normalize the gene expression data.
Results: A systematic exploration of suitable reference genes in Brachypodium is presented here.
Nine reference gene candidates were chosen, and their gene sequences were obtained from the
Brachypodium expressed sequence tag (EST) databases. Their expression levels were examined by
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using 21 different Brachypodium plant samples, including
those from different plant tissues and grown under various growth conditions. Effects of plant
growth hormones were also visualized in the assays. The expression stability of the candidate genes
was evaluated using two analysis software packages, geNorm and NormFinder. In conclusion, the
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 18 gene (UBC18) was validated as a suitable reference gene across all
the plant samples examined. While the expression of the polyubiquitin genes (Ubi4 and Ubi10) was
most stable in different plant tissues and growth hormone-treated plant samples, the expression of
the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase gene (SamDC) ranked was most stable in plants grown
under various environmental stresses.
Conclusion: This study identified the reference genes that are most suitable for normalizing the
gene expression data in Brachypodium. These reference genes will be particularly useful when
stress-responsive genes are analyzed in order to produce transgenic plants that exhibit enhanced
stress resistance.

Background
Quantification of gene expression levels is a fundamental
step in virtually all aspects of molecular biological

research. It is particularly important when genes that are
expressed specifically under certain growth conditions are
to be compared. Common experimental techniques used

to evaluate gene expression levels include Northern blot
hybridization and reverse transcription (RT)-mediated
PCR (RT-PCR); both techniques are practical for analyzing
expression of a small set of genes and are complemented
by microarray analysis, which is routinely employed for
large-scale, global expression profilings. In recent years,
the qRT-PCR has been the method of choice for measuring gene expression levels in multiple samples involving a
limited number of genes. It provides accurate and sensitive quantification of gene transcript levels, even for those
genes with fairly low transcript levels are [1-3].
The popularity of the qRT-PCR method reflects the need
for ways to quantitatively analyze gene expression data in
the fields of molecular medicine, biotechnology, microbiology, and molecular diagnostics [4] as well as to accurately quantify mRNA levels in plants [5]. However, to
avoid experimental deviations or the errors that inevitably
occur during sample preparation procedures and data
analysis, all of which make quantitation of gene transcripts unreliable, normalization of the qRT-PCR data is
essential. The most common way to normalize the data is
to use appropriate internal reference genes. An ideal reference gene is expressed at a constant level in all plant tissues under various growth conditions. Its expression
should not be influenced by environmental changes or by
exogenous application of growth hormones.
Commonly used reference genes in plant molecular biology, frequently called housekeeping genes, play a general
role in basic cellular processes, such as cell structure maintenance and primary cellular metabolism, and thus are
usually unaffected by external factors. For example, genes
encoding tubulins, actins, or elongation factors are widely
used in gene expression studies in Arabidopsis thaliana
(Arabidopsis hereafter) and Oryza sativa (rice hereafter).
Brachypodium is a temperate wild grass species. Its morphological, genomic, and molecular genetic characteristics and simple growth requirements make it an ideal
model system for grass biology [6]. Its genome size
(approximately 355 Mbp) is smaller than that of rice. It
also has a short growth cycle. A single plant life cycle can
be completed within 6–8 weeks. Self-fertility, the availability of several diploid accessions, and its intrinsic resistance to diverse biotic and abiotic stress conditions are
additional attributes.
Arabidopsis is widely used as a model system for all flowering plants. Rice has been used as a model for genomics
research for all temperate grass species, including major
cereals, such as barley and wheat. However, recent
genomic analyses have revealed that the Brachypodium
genome is phylogenetically closer to the genomes of economically important crops, such as wheat and barley, and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/112

several potential biofuel grasses, including switch grasses
[7]. Brachypodium exhibits many agricultural traits similar to these grass crops. Furthermore, a protocol has
recently been established for infecting Brachypodium
with Magnaporthe grisea (rice blast) in order to explore its
potential as a model system in which to study host-pathogen interactions [8]. To date, such molecular assays have
routinely been carried out using rice or related monocots.
The rapidly growing interest in Brachypodium triggered
the establishment of a series of genomic resources; these
include the collecting of nuclear genomic sequences and
bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)/EST-based libraries
in addition to the characterization of individual genetic
resources [9]. Furthermore, the Brachypodium genome
project is currently underway, and the full genomic
sequence will be released to the public in the near future
[7]. Several groups have also reported the existence of efficient Agrobacterium-mediated Brachypodium transformation systems [10,11], which are essential for functional
genomics studies in Brachypodium. Such technological
progress in Brachypodium research can help realize its
potential as a new model system for biofuel grass biology,
provided that stable reference genes are identified for gene
expression studies in this plant species.
In this study, we report on reference genes that can potentially be used to normalize the results of gene expression
studies in Brachypodium. Nine candidate genes, including those encoding actin (ACT7), elongation factor 1alpha (EF1α, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH), rubisco activase (RCA), SamDC, alpha-tubulin
(TUA6), UBC18, Ubi4, and Ubi10, were chosen, and partial gene sequences were extracted from the available
Brachypodium databases http://harvest.ucr.edu. Brachypodium was either grown under various stress conditions
or treated with an array of growth hormones. Different
plant tissues and plants at different developmental stages
were also included in the assays. Our data showed that
while expression of the UBC18 gene was the most stable
among all the plant samples examined, the Ubi4 and
Ubi10 genes would be appropriate for analysis of gene
expression studies in different plant tissues. Their expressions were also stable under the growth hormone treatments. In the meantime, the SamDC gene showed the
most stable expression patterns in plants grown under
diverse abiotic stress conditions. This work will certainly
facilitate our future work on gene expression studies in
biofuel grass crops as well as in Brachypodium.

Results
Selection of potential reference genes in Brachypodium
A handful of reference genes, including those encoding
tubulins, actins, and elongation factors, are regularly used
to normalize the RT-PCR or qRT-PCR data in Arabidopsis

and rice. Additional genes, such as elongation initiation factor 4a (ELF4a), are sometimes employed to further standardize the data on plant samples grown under specific
growth conditions. However, because none of the reference genes currently used in Arabidopsis and rice provides
a stable expression under all the examined conditions,
multiple reference genes must be included to ensure the
normalization of the data in some molecular analyses.
Although genomic, cellular, and morphological aspects of
Brachypodium have been widely explored in recent years,
little information is available about molecular genetic
analyses, and thus no systematic efforts have been made
to identify its stable reference genes. Extensive literature
searches have revealed that genes encoding various types
of proteins, including enzymes and structural proteins,
are widely used as internal controls for studies of plant
gene expression through RT-PCR, qRT-PCR, and gene chip
assays [12,13]. Analyzing these reference genes in other
plant species led us to choose nine candidate reference
genes in Brachypodium; ACT7, RCA, EF1α, GAPDH,
SamDC, TUA6, UBC18, Ubi4, and Ubi10. Using the
sequence information deposited in the HarvEST http://
harvest.ucr.edu under the GenBank accession numbers
listed in Table 1, a series of qRT-PCR primers was designed
which the sizes of the PCR products were approximately
100 – 300 bp (see Additional file 1).
RNA integrity and amplification specificity
For qRT-PCR analyses, we included 21 different total RNA
samples extracted from various plant materials. The plant
materials analyzed included 5 different plant tissues (callus, leaf, root, spike, stem), plants at 4 different developmental stages (early vegetative, late vegetative, transition,
and reproductive phases), and plants exposed to 4 different abiotic stress conditions, such as high salinity (300
mM NaCl), cold (4°C for 5 h), heat (42°C for 2 h), and
drought (400 mM mannitol). Brachypodium seedlings
were also treated with 8 different growth hormones;
indole-3-acetic acid (IAA, 50 μM), brassinolide (BL, 50
μM), zeatin (50 μM), abscisic acid (ABA, 100 μM), gib-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/112

berellic acid (GA, 50 μM), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC, 50 μM), salicylic acid (SA, 100 μM),
and methyl jasmonic acid (MeJA, 100 μM).
Prior to carrying out qRT-PCR reactions, the viability of all
RNA samples was examined using RT-PCR to evaluate the
expression of the GAPDH gene. All the RT-PCR reactions
produced a single GAPDH-specific band with a predicted
molecular size (approximately 500 bp) on a 1.2% agarose
gel visualized with ethidium bromide staining (see Additional file 2), confirming the hypothesis that the RNA
samples extracted from Brachypodium plant materials are
appropriate for transcript level analysis. The integrity and
quality of RNA samples were further evaluated by electrophoretic analysis using the Labwork Image Acquisition
and Analysis software (Media Cybernetics) (see Additional file 2).
The results showed that the GAPDH gene was stably
expressed under various abiotic stress conditions and not
discernibly affected by diverse growth hormones,
although it exhibited less stability in some plant tissues
(see Additional file 2).
To examine the stability of reference gene expressions,
transcript levels were measured by qRT-PCR. Aliquots of
the primary cDNA synthesis reaction mixture were used in
qRT-PCR to amplify gene-specific primer pairs of each of
the nine candidate reference genes. Primer dimer formation and nonspecific amplification can falsely increase
gene transcript levels and thus must be avoided, especially
when qRT-PCR is carried out using the SYBR green dyes.
Gene-specific amplification of each of the nine candidate
genes was confirmed by the appearance of a single, dominant peak in the qRT-PCR dissociation curve analyses
(see Additional files 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).

Transcript levels of the selected marker genes were compared by qRT-PCR in Brachypodium plants treated either
with various growth hormones or with abiotic stresses
(see Additional file 12). We found that Brachypodium
genes, which are homologous to IAA1, ARR4, BAS1,
NPR1, CBF3, and HSC70, were significantly induced by
the relevant treatments. In contrast, genes that are homologous to GA3OX2-1, RD22, and Chitinase1 were repressed
under the conditions examined (see Additional files 13
and 14). These observations indicate that treating Brachypodium seedlings with growth hormones or growing
seedlings under abiotic stress conditions conferred regulatory effects on the selected marker genes similar to those
found in Arabidopsis.
Expression data analysis
A simple, widely used way to identify stably expressed
genes is to calculate cycle threshold (Ct) values in the qRTPCR reactions. The Ct value represents the cycle at which
a significant increase of the PCR product, which is measured by an increase in fluorescence, occurs; this cycle is
generally marked by the middle of the exponential phase
of amplification. Gene expression analyses of the nine reference genes exhibited a narrow mean Ct value range
across all the experimental samples (Figure 1). The Ct values ranged from 13 to 22, while most of the values were
distributed between 15 and 19. Ubi4 was the most abundantly transcribed, reaching the threshold fluorescence
peak after 13 amplification cycles. The Ct average of all
other genes was approximately 17 cycles. As a result, the
Ubi4 transcript level was approximately 16 times more
abundant than the average of the data set. The least abundant transcripts were those of UBC18 having a Ct value of
19 or higher. Most of the reference genes had relatively
smaller variations in gene expression (below 1 cycle)
except for RCA.

The geNorm software was employed as a means of determining the expression stability of the selected reference
genes http://medgen.ugent.be/~jvdesomp/genorm/[14].
This program automatically calculates the average expression stability value (M) as the average pairwise variation
(V) of a particular gene with all other control genes and
determines the V values with all other control genes as the
standard deviation of the logarithmically transformed
expression ratios.

genes at each step during stepwise exclusion of the least

under various experimental conditions. Since there is no
information on marker genes available in Brachypodium,
we screened potential marker genes in the Brachypodium
databases that are homologous to those well characterized
in Arabidopsis.

stable reference gene. Starting from the least stable gene
on the left, the genes are ranked according to increasing
expression stability, ending with the two most stable
genes on the right. The most stable reference gene was not
identical in individual plant samples. While the SamDC
and UBC18 genes were most stably expressed throughout
the plant life cycle (Figure 2b), the Ubi4 and Ubi10 genes
ranked highest in different plant tissue samples with an M
value of 0.169 (Figure 2c). For the growth hormonetreated samples, the most stable genes were GAPDH and
UBC18 with an M value of 0.169 (Figure 2d). The EF1α,
UBC18, and SamDC genes ranked high in Brachypodium
seedlings grown under abiotic stress conditions, indicating that these genes are stably expressed and probably
play a housekeeping role (Figures 2e and 2f). All the tested
samples reached a high expression stability with relatively
low M values of less than 1, which are far below the
default limit of M ≤ 1.5 [14].
Examining all the expression data examined revealed that
UBC18 and ACT7 are the most stable genes that might be
widely used for multiple purposes (Figure 2a). In contrast,
RCA was the least stable among the genes examined.
To determine the optimal number of reference genes
required for accurate normalization, the geNorm software
was used to calculate the pairwise variation (Vn/Vn+1)
between the sequential normalization factors (NF) (NFn
and NFn+1) (Figure 3). In the original publication describing geNorm [14], a threshold of 0.15 or lower for the pairwise variation was proposed to indicate that inclusion of

an additional reference gene is unnecessary. However,
0.15 is not a strict cut-off value but an ideal value. Therefore, the graph displayed in Figure 3 is intended only to
provide guidance for determining the optimal number of
reference genes. In addition, the observed trend of changing V values when using additional genes can be equally
informative. Therefore, in most cases, the use of three reference genes results in much more accurate and reliable
normalization than only one gene and is thus considered
to be a valid normalization strategy. We therefore decided
to take the threshold of 0.1 as a cut-off value for the inclusion of our reference genes.
Analysis of the data obtained from different plant tissues
using the geNorm software produced a plot displaying the
average expression stability values of the candidate reference genes in each round of the analysis, ranking them
from the least stable gene at the far left to the two most stable genes at the far right (Figure 2). Evaluation of different
plant tissues revealed a significant decrease in the pairwise
variation with the inclusion of a fourth gene (note the difference in the V values of V2/3 and V3/4 in Figure 3). The
pairwise variation at the V3/4 value was 0.086, which is
below the threshold of 0.1, indicating that the normalization factor should preferably contain at least three reference genes. Therefore, it would be ideal to include Ubi4,
Ubi10, and EF1α as reference genes to normalize gene
expression data in plant tissues.
Analysis of the pairwise variation in the growth hormonetreated samples revealed that a V score of 0.064 is
achieved with two reference genes (Figures 2d and 3),

indicating that the average of the top two reference genes,
GAPDH and UBC18, is the optimal normalization factor
for gene expression studies in the growth hormonetreated Brachypodium plant materials. In the heat- and
cold-treated plant samples, SamDC and EF1α were the
most stable reference genes (Figure 2e). As in the growth
hormone-treated samples, the pairwise variation at V2/3
was below the threshold of 0.1, and thus two reference
genes, SamDC and EF1α, would be sufficient (Figure 3).
In the meantime, evaluation of the salt- and droughttreated samples did not exhibit any discernible difference
in the pairwise variation with the inclusion of a third gene
(Figures 2f and 3). It is apparent that the average of the top
two reference genes, SamDC and UBC18, is the optimal
normalization factor for gene expression studies in the
salt- and drought-treated samples.
To further confirm the results obtained by the geNorm
program, we also employed the Normfinder software
an
http://www.mdl.dk/publicationsnormfinder.htm,
algorithm for identifying the optimal normalization gene
among a set of candidate genes. This software ranks the set
of candidate normalization genes according to the stability of their expression patterns in a given sample set analyzed in a given experimental design [15]. The results of
the Normfinder analysis applied to our data sets are summarized in Table 2. The ranking of the reference genes was
almost identical to that determined by the geNorm software. The Ubi4 and Ubi10 genes still ranked highest for
different plant tissues and growth hormone-treated plant
samples, while the GAPDH or SamDC genes appeared to

be the highest reliable controls for plant samples exposed
to abiotic stress.

Discussion
The qRT-PCR is broadly accepted as the method of choice
for accurate and sensitive quantification of gene transcript
levels, even for those genes whose transcript levels are
low. For valid qRT-PCR analysis, accurate normalization
of gene expression against an appropriate internal control
is required. Most gene expression studies in the literature
generally use a single internal control for normalization
[16], and the validity of the conclusion depends highly on
the control applied. Therefore, it is necessary to validate
the expression stability of the control gene under specific
experimental conditions prior to its use for normalization.

plant Orobanche ramose [19]. On the other hand, the
expression of UBQ5 and EF1α was the most stable among
all the plant tissues of rice [20]. In potato, EF1α is also the
most stably expressed in plants grown under biotic and
abiotic stress conditions [21]. In addition, GAPDH exhibited the most stable expression in different plant tissues of
sugarcane [22]. Although genes encoding ubiquitins and
polyubiquitins are stably expressed in different plant tissues in several plant species, these genes may not be stably
expressed in other plant species. The reference genes
appear to be regulated differentially in different plant species and cell types or under different experimental conditions. Therefore, no single reference gene with stable
expression is suitable for normalizing all expression data
obtained from various experimental conditions.

The most commonly used reference genes in the pregenomic era were chosen primarily for their known or suspected housekeeping roles in basic cellular processes. The
actin gene, one such reference gene, is used in normalizing the quantification of gene expression levels [17].
Genes encoding GAPDH, actin, and EF1α have been used
as the most relevant reference genes for berry development [18]. However, the actin gene was found to be inappropriate for use as a reference gene, since some variations
of the transcript levels were observed in different plant tissues and plants grown under different growth conditions.

Our data demonstrate that UBC18 and SamDC are a reliable set of reference genes for normalizing gene expression
data when multiple Brachypodium samples are analyzed
(Figure 2). In particular, UBC18 showed acceptable
expression stability in all the plant samples examined.
Accumulation of the SamDC transcripts is ubiquitous in
different plant organs in Brachypodium, including the callus, spike, root, leaf, and sheath. Therefore, it is not surprising that SamDC seems to be essential for embryo
development in Arabidopsis [23]. It is likely that GAPDH
and SamDC play a housekeeping role in Brachypodium
growth and development.

Our study showed that the polyubiquitin genes (Ubi4 and
Ubi10) and the UBC18 gene encoding an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme exhibited the most stable expression in different plant tissues or in plants treated with various
growth hormones. These results are also supported by the
previous observation in which Ubi10 showed a highly stable expression pattern in Arabidopsis [12]. An ubiquitin
gene (UBQ) and a TUA gene are the most stably expressed
in plant tissue samples from poplar [12]. Notably, the
UBQ gene is the most stably expressed in the parasitic

While the geNorm software is used to identify not only
the most stable gene but also the optimum pair of genes
with least variation in their expression ratios, the
NormFinder software is able to identify the gene with the
most stable expression. Our results lead us to propose that
the mean data rendered by UBC18, SamDC, Ubi4, and
Ubi10 be used to normalize gene expression values in
Brachypodium more accurately. To our knowledge, this is
the first systematic attempt to identify reference genes in
Brachypodium.

The Brachypodium genome project is currently underway
under the auspices of the US Department of Energy. A
draft genomic sequence is expected to be released in the
near future, which will trigger diverse molecular genetic
studies on Brachypodium as well as on related grass species. Of particular interest is how the plant responds to
environmental stresses. However, there is no report so far
on the stress-responsive genes or those involved in growth
hormone signaling in Brachypodium. In this work, we
searched for potential marker genes mediating stress
responses and growth hormone signaling. Most of the
selected marker genes exhibited responses to abiotic
stresses and growth hormones that were similar to those
of the Arabidopsis gene homologues, suggesting that the
known stress-responsive genes and underlying molecular
mechanisms in Arabidopsis are conserved in Brachypodium. One exception is the Brachypodium RD22 gene.
While the Arabidopsis RD22 gene (AtRD22) is induced by
ABA and abiotic stresses, the Brachypodium RD22 gene is
repressed by ABA, high salt, and drought (see Additional
files 13 and 14). At least some Brachypodium genes, such
as RD22, likely play a role that is characterized by molecular mechanisms distinct from those exerted by the Arabidopsis gene homologues.

Conclusion
We identified several reference genes that are suitable for
qRT-PCR data normalization in Brachypodium. This is the
first systematic exploration of valid reference genes in this
plant species. Although most of the selected candidate
genes exhibited stable expression patterns acceptable for
reference genes, different genes showed the highest stability in different plant samples. While expression of Ubi4
and Ubi10 was most stable in different plant tissues and
growth hormone-treated plant samples, that of SamDC
was most stable under different environmental conditions. Overall, UBC18 is our reference gene of choice for
analyzing multiple Brachypodium samples.

Methods
Plant sample preparation
A community standard diploid inbred line of Brachypodium distachyon, Bd21, was used for all experimental treatments. The palea and lemma were carefully peeled off
from the mature seeds with fine forceps. The stripped
seeds were sterilized by soaking in a solution of 10%
household bleach (5.25% NaOCl) supplemented with
0.1% Tween 20 for 10 min with occasional rocking. The
sterilized seeds were thoroughly rinsed three times with
sterile double-distilled water and placed on Murashige
and Skoog (MS)-agar plates (MS-agar plates hereafter)
(4.3 g/l MS salts with vitamins, 3% sucrose, pH 5.8, and
0.4% phytagel). The seeds were cold-treated at 4°C for 2
days to synchronize germination and allowed to germinate in a culture room controlled at 25°C with a daily
photoperiodic cycle of 16 h light and 8 h dark.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/112

Four-week-old Brachypodium plants were used for treatments with growth hormones and abiotic stresses. Harvested plant samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at -80°C until RNA extraction. For gene expression
studies in different plant tissues, appropriate plant tissues
were harvested from 5-week-old, fully-grown plants. For
gene expression studies at different developmental stages,
plants were harvested at 7 days after germination (DAG)
(early vegetative phase), 12 (late vegetative phase), 20
(transition phase), and 30 (reproductive phase) (see
Additional file 2).
Growth hormones and abiotic stresses
For growth hormone treatments, 4-week-old Brachypodium plants were transferred to the MS liquid cultures
supplemented with IAA (50 μM), brassinolide (BL, 50
μM), zeatin (50 μM), ABA (100 μM), GA (50 μM), 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC, 50 μM), SA (100
μM), or with MeJA (100 μM) and incubated for 5 h with
gentle shaking. The mock seedlings were similarly incubated in a MS liquid but without adding growth hormones.

For salt and drought stress treatments, 4-week-old Brachypodium plants were transferred to the MS liquid cultures
supplemented either with 300 mM NaCl or with 400 mM
mannitol, respectively, and gently shaken for 5 h. For cold
and heat treatments, the seedlings were incubated at 4°C
for 5 h or 42°C for 2 h, respectively.
Selection of potential reference genes in Brachypodium
To identify potential Brachypodium homologues of the
Arabidopsis or rice genes commonly used as internal controls for gene expression studies, we queried Version 0.52
of the HarvEST:Brachypodium software http://harvestweb.org, which displays 6 different libraries from Brachypodium. All gene sequences were obtained from the GenBank dbEST database. The HarvEST:Brachypodium
software contains best BLASTX hits from the UniProt and
the rice and Arabidopsis genomes (TIGR version 5, February 2007, and TAIR version 7, April 2007, respectively).

The HarvEST is principally an EST database-viewing software that emphasizes gene function and is oriented to
comparative genomics and design of oligonucleotides,
with an aim to support diverse research activities, such as
microarray content design, functional annotation, and
physical and genetic mapping http://harvest.ucr.edu. The
HarvEST:Brachypodium is the most recent and standardized EST database for Brachypodium and thus can be used
to examine sequence alignments and determine where
individual sequences reliably deviate from a consensus
sequence.
Selected Brachypodium ESTs of potential reference genes
were used to design primers. A set of qRT-PCR primers
Page 8 of 11

BMC Plant Biology 2008, 8:112

with high-efficiency for nine individual reference genes
was designed using the Primer3 software (version 0.4.0)
[24]. The primers were designed to have melting temperatures in a range of 50 – 60°C, depending on individual
genes. Their sequences are summarized in Additional file
1.
Total RNA extraction and primary cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was extracted from appropriate plant samples
using the RNeasy Plant mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)
according to the manufacturer's procedure. The quality
and integrity of the RNA samples were evaluated by
absorbance measurements and by electrophoretic analysis
using the Labwork Image Acquisition and Analysis Program (Media Cybernetics, San Diego, CA). All the RNA
samples used in the qRT-PCR reactions showed a 260/280
nm absorbance ratio of 1.8 – 2.2. RNA samples with a
ratio of ≈ 2 are generally qualified for subsequent enzymatic reactions. Prior to RT-PCR and qRT-PCR, total RNA
samples were pretreated with a RNase-free DNase I to
eliminate any contaminating genomic DNA. The primary
cDNA was synthesized from approximately 3 μg of total
RNA using the MMLV first-strand synthesis system
(Promega, Madison, WI) and the oilgo-dT and random
primers in a reaction volume of 40 μl according to the
manufacturer's procedure.

To rule out any genomic DNA contamination in the RNA
preparations, the RNA samples and genomic DNA were
subject in parallel to PCR amplifications of the ARR4 and
GAPDH gene sequences (30 cycles), and the PCR products
were compared. No visible amplifications of genomic
DNAs were detected from the RNA samples (see Additional file 15).
RT-PCR and qRT-PCR
One μl of the primary cDNA synthesis reaction mixture
was taken for subsequent PCR amplification by RT-PCR or
qRT-PCR. RT-PCR runs were routinely carried out for 20
to 35 cycles, depending on the linear range of PCR amplification for each gene. Each PCR cycle included incubations at 94°C for 30 s, at 55°C for 1 min, and at 72°C for
5 min. One additional cycle at 72°C for 10 min was run
after the last cycle to allow trimming of incomplete
polymerizations. Positive and negative control genes were
included in the reaction sets to ensure the feasibility of the
assay conditions. The RT-PCR primers used are listed in
Additional file 1.

qRT-PCR reactions were carried out in 96-well blocks with
an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System using
the SYBR Green I master mix in a reaction volume of 25
μl, which contains 1 μl of the primary cDNA reaction mixture, 2X SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and a primer pair. The primers
used are listed in Additional file 1. The two-step thermal

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/8/112

cycling profile used was 15 s at 95°C and 1 min at 60°C.
All qRT-PCR reactions were carried out in biological
duplicates, each of which was used for RNA extraction followed by qRT-PCR in triplicate. The final threshold cycle
(Ct) values were the mean of six values (biological duplicates, each with triplicate). The comparative ΔΔCt method
was used to evaluate the relative quantities of each amplified product in the samples. The Ct was automatically
determined for each reaction by the Applied Biosystems
7500 Real-Time PCR System set with default parameters.
The specificity of the qRT-PCR reactions was determined
by melt curve analysis of the amplified products using the
standard method installed in the System.
Each qRT-PCR reaction set included a negative control
with water instead of cDNA. Duplicate measurements
were averaged, and the mean values were used for further
calculations.
Determining expression stability of reference genes
The expression stability of each reference gene was analyzed using the geNorm (version 3.5) and NormFinder
(version 0.953) software packages, which are also integrated into the GenEx software (version 4.3.5, http://
www.multid.se). The geNorm software calculates the gene
expression stability (M) for a reference gene as the average
pairwise variation V for the gene with all other tested reference genes. Stepwise exclusion of the gene with the
highest M value allows the tested genes to be ranked
according to the stability of their expression patterns.

The NormFinder software is an algorithm for identifying
the optimal normalization gene among a set of candidate
genes. It ranks the set of candidate normalization genes
according to the stability of their expression patterns in a
given sample set under a given experimental design.
Therefore, it can analyze expression data obtained
through any quantitative method, such as qRT-PCR and
microarray-based expression profiling. The lowest stability value represents the most stable gene expression within
the gene set examined.
