Abstract
Background: Transcription factors that encode ANTP-class homeobox genes play crucial roles
in determining the body plan organization and specification of different organs and tissues in
bilaterian animals. The three-gene ParaHox family descends from an ancestral gene cluster that
existed before the evolution of the Bilateria. All three ParaHox genes are reported from
deuterostomes and lophotrochozoans, but not to date from any ecdysozoan taxa, and there is
evidence that the ParaHox genes, like the related Hox genes, were ancestrally a single chromosomal
cluster. However, unlike the Hox genes, there is as yet no strong evidence that the ParaHox genes
are expressed in spatial and temporal order during embryogenesis.
Results: We isolated fragments of the three Nereis virens ParaHox genes, then used these as probes
for whole-mount in situ hybridization in larval and postlarval worms. In Nereis virens the ParaHox
genes participate in antero-posterior patterning of ectodermal and endodermal regions of the
digestive tract and are expressed in some cells in the segment ganglia. The expression of these
genes occurs in larval development in accordance with the position of these cells along the main
body axis and in postlarval development in accordance with the position of cells in ganglia along the
antero-posterior axis of each segment. In none of these tissues does expression of the three
ParaHox genes follow the rule of temporal collinearity.
Conclusion: In Nereis virens the ParaHox genes are expressed during antero-posterior patterning
of the digestive system (ectodermal foregut and hindgut, and endodermal midgut) of Nereis virens.
These genes are also expressed during axial specification of ventral neuroectodermal cell domains,
where the expression domains of each gene are re-iterated in each neuromere except for the first
parapodial segment. These expression domains are probably predetermined and may be directed
on the antero-posterior axis by the Hox genes, whose expression starts much earlier during
embryogenesis. Our results support the hypothesis that the ParaHox genes are involved in anteroposterior patterning of the developing embryo, but they do not support the notion that these genes
function only in the patterning of endodermal tissues.

Background
Transcription factors that encode ANTP-class homeobox
genes; NK, Rhox, Irx, and in particular the Hox and ParaHox genes, play crucial roles in determining body plan
organization and specification of different organs and tissues of bilaterian animals [1-7]. The Hox and ParaHox
genes are believed to descend from a cluster of two to four
genes that duplicated before the divergence of the Cnidaria and the Bilateria [5,8-13]: both sets of genes are
ancestrally clustered on the genome, and individual genes
within one cluster are paralogous with genes in the other
cluster (but see [14] for a dissenting hypothesis).
Within the Bilateria Hox genes function to determine vectorial regionalization of the body along the antero-posterior axis and to specify body parts within this
regionalization [1,2,4,15-18]. The Hox genes are also characterized by a high degree of structural and functional
conservation: they are often (and ancestrally) found as a
single chromosomal cluster, and are expressed in canonical spatial and temporal modes during embryogenesis.
The ParaHox genes are also believed to have originated as
an organized chromosomal cluster, but the evidence for
spatially and temporally collinear expression in these
genes is not as strong, partially due to lack of data
[8,12,19,20]. The three ParaHox genes; Gsx, Xlox, and Cdx,
were first described as a paralogs to the Hox cluster in
amphioxus (Branchiostoma floridae) by Brooke et al. [8]. A
full complement of ParaHox genes has been shown for a
number of other deuterostomes: the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus [21], the hemichordate Ptychodera
flava [22], the ascidian Ciona intestinalis [23], and a
number of mammals, as well as for some lophotrochozoans; the sipunculids Phascolion strombus and Nephasoma
minuta [23], the polychaete annelid Capitella sp. I [20], the
clitellate annelid Perionyx excavatus [24], and the chiton
Nuttallochiton mirandus [25]. However the full set of ParaHox genes has not yet been found in any ecdysozoan
taxon, including two taxa for which complete genomes
are available: the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster has no
Xlox ortholog [26,27] while the nematode Caenorhabitis
elegans has neither Gsh nor Xlox orthologs [28].
Of the organisms studied to date the linkage has been
shown only in amphioxus, mouse, and human. The ParaHox genes are not linked in teleost fishes [7,8], the ascidian C. intestinalis, or the sea urchin S. purpuratus [21,23].
Brooke et al. [8] reported collinear expression of the ParaHox genes in anterior, middle, and posterior tissues of
amphioxus, and suggested that these genes may be
responsible for axial patterning in the digestive tract. This
pattern may be ancestral for the ParaHox cluster [4,8,10].
Collinear expression of two ParaHox genes in the digestive

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/61

tract has been described for other deuterostomes: mouse
and human [29,30], ascidians [31-34], and sea urchins
[21]. In all cases Xlox (= Pdx) and Cdx expression domains
were found in the central and posterior parts of the gut,
respectively. The anterior ParaHox gene, however, is not
expressed in the anterior of the gut, but rather in the
brains of these deuterostomes. Holland [10] suggested
that Gsx may have lost its function in the anterior gut as a
result of changes in the patterning mechanism of the position of the mouth in deuterostomes. If this is the case then
all three genes may still participate in regionalization of
the gut in the protostomes (Lophotrochozoa and Ecdysozoa) [4,10].
Fröbius and Seaver [20] looked at expression of the ParaHox genes in a lophotrochozoan, the polychaete annelid
Capitella sp. I, and found that Gsx is not expressed in the
gut. This result does not support Holland's hypothesis
that ParaHox genes are involved in gut regionalization in
protostomes. However, Capitella sp. I is a single taxon, not
basal within the annelids, and may have lost Gsx function
independently of the deuterostomes.
In order to better understand the function of the ParaHox
genes in the Lophotrochozoa we examined their expression in the polychaete annelid Nereis virens. Within the
annelids Capitella sp. I and N. virens are evolutionarily
remote [35,36] so N. virens represents an opportunity to
understand, or at least make hypotheses, regarding conservation of ParaHox expression among the polychaetes.
In addition, errant nereids are believed to retain many
ancestral characteristics of the annelids, including life history, developmental and genome characteristics, homonomy of segmentation, a simple reproductive system,
gradual metamorphosis, absence of highly specialized larval structures, and high fecundity [37-40], so ParaHox
expression in N. virens may be more likely to represent the
ancestral state.
We have cloned the full complement of ParaHox genes
from the polychaete Nereis virens: Nvi-Gsh, Nvi-Xlox, and
Nvi-Cad, and report larval and postlarval expression patterns for these genes in this study.

Results
Nereis virens life history
The main stages of Nereis virens development are presented in Table 1. The trochophore (early, middle, and
late) is an unsegmented spherical larva comprising two
hemispheres, the episphere and the hyposphere, whose
border is marked by a belt of ciliated cells, the prototroch.
The metatrochophore (early, middle, and late) larva has
signs of external segmentation. The trochophore and
metatrochophore are non-feeding swimming planktonic
larvae. The late metatrochophore falls to the sea floor

further anal region; somatic plate weakly developed
hyposphere slightly elongated, at posterior ciliated telotroch is formed; stomodaeum
and further anal region lie more widely apart from each other; chaetal sacs become
morphologically apparent
larva starts to show external metamery; mesotrochs starts to form in posterior part of
each segment; chaetae begin to develop in two anterior pairs of chaetal sacs, but do
not protrude from the larval body yet
chaetae of the two anterior pairs of chaetal sacs protrude from the larval body, chaetae
of the third chaetal sac start to form, segmental boundaries become distinct
larval body gradually elongates; parapodial anlagen and pygidial (anal) lobe start to form
functional parapodia; distinct head with some head appendages (two antennae and two
peristomial cirri); digestive tube completely form and larvae start to eat
fourth trunk segment (first postlarval) begins to form

where it transforms into a benthic larva, the nectochaete,
and starts feeding. The nectochaete has parapodia that it
uses for crawling. During the nectochaete state a growth
zone, the prepygidium, forms near the posterior of the
larva and the animal then transforms into a juvenile
worm. During the postlarval period of development many
(about 200) postlarval segments are formed from this
growth zone. Figures 7 and 8 show cartoons of these
stages. More detailed descriptions of early stages of N.
virens development can also be found in Kulakova et al.
[18]. Very similar development has also been described
for Nereis limbata [41], (now Neanthes, cit. by Nielsen
[42]), and Platynereis dumerilii [43].
Expression of N. virens ParaHox genes in the prostomium
The prostomium of polychaetes is derived from the episphere of the trochophore. The cells of the episphere form
from the first quartet of micromeres and include the head
ectoderm, the cerebral ganglion, the larval and definitive
eyes, the antennae, the palps, and other sensory organs of
the head [41,43-45]. We have observed the expression of
two Nvi-ParaHox genes, Nvi-Gsh and Nvi-Xlox, in the prostomium of N. virens.

Nvi-Gsh expression begins in cells of the episphere during
the middle trochophore stage when a pair of intensive,
bilateral expression domains appears in the dorso-medial
episphere (Fig. 1a). Later, during the early metatrochophore stage the expression pattern is more complex. Multiple bilaterally symmetrical dorso-lateral domains occur
in much of the episphere (Fig. 1b). The intensity of NviGsh expression substantially diminishes at later stages of
larval development, but is maintained in a small number
of cells in a bilaterally symmetrical pattern (Fig. 1c, d).
Expression of Nvi-Gsh in juvenile worms of 4–6 segments
occurs in large cells on the ventral side of the head (Fig.
1e) and in cells at the dorsal part of the head approxi-

mately in the position of the adult eyes (Fig. 1f). There is
no detectable expression of Gsh in larger juvenile worms.
The first detectable expression of Nvi-Xlox is at the late trochophore stage when a pair of weak and transitory
domains occurs in the lateral part of the episphere. These
symmetrical zones do not coincide with the Gsh expression domains (Fig. 1g). Much later, at the nectochaete
stage, Nvi-Xlox expression resumes in a pair of lobes in the
brain (Fig. 1h, Fig. 4i). This disappears at the juvenile
worm stage.
Expression of N. virens ParaHox genes during ventral
nervous system formation
The ventral (somatic or vegetative) plate of polychaetes is
derived from the 2d blastomere (the first somatoblast),
which originates in the second quartet micromere. The
descendants of this cell (the ectoteloblasts of Wilson [41])
intensively proliferate in the dorsal region of the embryo
during gastrulation and at the trochophore stage. The lateral domains of the somatic plate become wider, move
towards the ventral side and join each other between the
future mouth and anus to form the ventral midline. This
process leads to gradual movement of the mouth under
the prototroch away from the vegetative pole that marks
the position of the future anus. The vegetative pole position is stable during all of larval development. The ventral
regions of the somatic plate form the neuroectoderm of
the ventral neural cord and probably also the parapodial
ganglia. The lateral regions of the somatic plate form the
chaetae sacs, and ectoderm of the larval segments as well
as the neurons of the peripheral nervous system [46]. The
larval trunk of N. virens consists of four segments – one
peristomial and three parapodial. The peristomial segment has no chaetal sacs and probably no neuromere
[47], but it forms two pairs of peristomial cirri with a pair
of pedal ganglia [44].

White arrows mark Nvi-Gsh expression in the stomodeum. (d-f) During the nectochaete stages Nvi-Gsh is expressed in a small group of cells at the ventral (d, e) and the dorsal (f) sides of the prostomium. (g, h)
Expression of Nvi-Xlox. (g) View from the animal pole. Early expression is very weak and occurs transiently in the lateral areas
of the episphere. (h) At the nectochaete stage Nvi-Xlox is expressed in a pair of lobes in the cerebral ganglion.
All three N. virens ParaHox genes are expressed in the ventral neuroectodermal cells. The activation of these genes
occurs at the late trochophore/early metatrochophore
stage in several symmetrical pairs of cells. The external
morphological markers of segments are absent at this
stage; hence the position of ParaHox-positive cells cannot
be determined with precision. However we can compare
the expression domains of Nvi-ParaHox genes and some
Nvi-Hox genes. We have previously described Nvi-Hox1,
Nvi-Hox4, and Nvi-Lox5 expression domains during early
developmental stages, and these can be use as positional
markers of the first, second, and third parapodial segments respectively [48].
During later developmental stages morphological markers of segments (mesotrochs) appear in the posterior of
each segment. The position of ParaHox-positive cells can
easily be compared with these markers. Note that the
boundaries of segments and neuromeres in the adult
worm do not coincide: the anterior boundary of the neu-

romeres is shifted ahead one third of a segment length
[44]. This offset probably also exists for larval segments
and forming neuromeres. If this is so then the anterior
part of the neuromere lies exactly under the mesotroch of
the preceding segment and its posterior part is at the level
of its own segment mesotroch (Fig. 7).
Expression of Nvi-Gsh during formation of the ventral nervous
system
Expression of Nvi-Gsh begins during the late trochophore/
early metatrochophore state, initially in one pair (Fig. 2a,
105 h) and later in several pairs (Fig. 2b, 112 h) of bilaterally situated surface neuroectodermal cells. The cells
expressing Nvi-Gsh are in the same relative positions as
those that express Nvi-Hox1 and Nvi-Hox4 – the first and
second parapodial segments [18].

Middle stage metatrochophore larvae have well developed mesotrochs in the posterior part of each segment. At
this stage Nvi-Gsh positive cells occur in the posterior part

segments (k) and during the middle metatrochophore stage Nvi-Xlox positive cells are visible in all parapodial segments in the
central part of the forming neuromeres (l, n), above the mesotrochs. In some cases (l, m) Nvi-Xlox positive cells are visible in
the lateral part of segments (empty arrowheads). At the late metotrochophore stage (m) short-term Nvi-Xlox expression occurs
in the lateral cells of the peristomial segments (white arrowheads). During the nectochaete stage Nvi-Xlox expression gradually
decreases (o) and then disappears (p). (q-x) Expression of Nvi-Cad. Expression of Nvi-Cad during the late trochophore and
early metatrochophore stages (q, r). This expression disappears by 120 h (s) but in some larvae Nvi-Cad positive cells can be
detected during the middle metatrochophore stage (t) at the level of the mesotroch of the third parapodial segment. Later, NviCad is not expressed in neuroectodermal cells (u-x). During all of larval development very strong Nvi-Cad expression occurs in
the posterior of the forming digestive system, in the forming pygidium and in the forming growth zone (see Fig. 4). View from

of the first and second parapodial segments parallel to or
slightly posterior to the mesotroch (Fig. 2c). The Nvi-Gsh
positive cells are thus localized in the anterior of the forming second and third neuromeres, and Nvi-Gsh positive
zones are closer to the midline than previously as a result
of rearrangement of the ventral plate cells. Nvi-Gsh expression in the neuromere of the first segment is no longer
detected at this time (Fig. 2c). During the course of metatrochophore development the domains of Nvi-Gsh expression become wider in the second and third neuromere
(Fig. 2d, e). Occasionally, single Nvi-Gsh positive cells can
be found more laterally (not shown). At the late metatrochophore and early nectochaete stages the level of Nvi-Gsh
expression gradually decreases. Still later the expression
completely disappears in the second and then also in the
third neuromeres (Fig. 2f, g). By the beginning of formation of the first postlarval segment Nvi-Gsh expression can
be detected again in the posterior part of the third larval
segment (Fig. 2h). This can be considered the expression
in the first postlarval neuromere.
Nvi-Gsh is expressed in the neuroectoderm of several
newly formed segments in the actively growing postlarval
worm. Bilaterally symmetrical surface Nvi-Gsh positive
cell groups are localized in the posterior zone of each seg-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/61

ment, which is also the anterior zone of subsequent neuromeres (Fig. 3a, b). Expression begins in one cell pair in
the third or fourth segment from the growth zone. These
two cells are far from the midline. In the one or two
immediately anterior segments the Nvi-Gsh expression
domain is a wider multicellular zone that is closer to the
midline. In older (i.e. more anterior) segments the expression is again localized in one pair of cells that is situated
in the anterior part of the neuromere. In still older segments expression is absent (Fig. 3A).
Expression of Nvi-Xlox during formation of the ventral nervous
system
Expression of Nvi-Xlox begins in the neuroectoderm at the
early metatrochophore stage (Fig. 2j, 112 h). Low levels of
expression can first be detected in several bilaterally symmetrical surface pairs of cells at the level of the first and
second parapodial segments (Fig. 2j, k). Later Nvi-Xlox is
also expressed in the third parapodial segment (Fig. 2l).
Nvi-Xlox expression domains in parapodial segments
become wider and stronger at middle and late metatrochophore stages. Weaker and short-term expression can
also be seen in the peristomial segment at these stages
(not shown). In all segments the expression domains are
localized anterior to the mesotrochs and thus are in the

expressing the gene remains (b). (c, d) Expression of Nvi-Xlox. Initial Nvi-Xlox expression occurs in segments that are older and

below the segmental border (d). (e, f) Expression of Nvi-Cad. Early Nvi-Cad expression occurs in newly formed segments, but
this expression disappears rapidly. The worm in (e) was stained with TO-PRO-1. Nvi-Cad expression in newly formed segments can also be detected during posterior regeneration. Nvi-Cad positive cells are situated close to the central part of segments or a little bit to the posterior, hence in the most posterior part of the neuromere (f). Black arrowhead marks the
segmental border; white arrowhead marks the growth zone.

central region of the neuromeres. In some larvae Nvi-Xlox
positive cells also occur in the lateral regions of segments
(Fig. 2l). This is analogous to expression of Nvi-Gsh at the
same stages. Intensive expression of Nvi-Xlox is maintained for much longer than that of Nvi-Gsh (Fig. 2n, o).
Nvi-Xlox expression gradually diminishes during the nectochaete stage (Fig. 2o), and is not detected in the neuroectoderm of the late nectochaete (Fig. 2p).
During postlarval segmentation Nvi-Xlox expression
occurs in the forming neuromeres of newly formed segments. This surface expression can be seen in the anterior
half of segments below segmental borders (Fig. 3c, d).
These segments already have parapodial anlagen and
cuticular furrows near nephridial pores. Expression gradually decreases in older segments that have chaetae and
more developed parapodia. The youngest newly formed
segments show no Nvi-Xlox expression.
Expression of Nvi-Cad during formation of the ventral nervous
system
In the late trochophore stage pairs of cells in the ventral
neuroectoderm express Nvi-Cad at the position where the
second and third parapodial segments will be formed
(Fig. 2q, 100 h). At this time the neuroectoderm consists
of one or two cell layers. The duration of neuroectodermal
Nvi-Cad expression is shorter compared to that of Nvi-Gsh
and Nvi-Xlox: Nvi-Cad expression is not detected after
112–115 h of development (Fig. 2s, u–x). However at the
middle trochophore stage weak surface expression was
visible in the third segment in a single larva from among
200–300 analyzed (Fig. 2t). In these rare larvae the position of the Nvi-Cad expression domain can be localized
because morphological markers are already formed and
expression patterns of all three Nvi-ParaHox genes in the
third forming neuromere can be compared at this stage.
Using this marker we can see that Nvi-Cad is expressed at
the level of the third parapodial segment mesotroch, NviXlox is expressed immediately anterior of this region, and
Nvi-Gsh is in turn expressed in cells just anterior to the
Nvi-Xlox expression domain (Fig. 2d, l, t). At later stages
Nvi-Cad is not expressed in the larval neuroectoderm.

Expression of Nvi-Cad resumes during postlarval development in newly formed segments, where pairs of Nvi-Cad
positive cells appear on the surface of the new segment.
Expression levels are very low and the Nvi-Cad positive
cells are better detected in TO-PRO-1 stained larvae. Bilaterally symmetrical Nvi-Cad positive cell groups are situated close to the center, or slightly to the posterior, of each
segment, i.e. in the posterior part of the neuromere (Fig.
3e). We observed this expression pattern in only a few animals, and think it likely that this expression is transient.
We found that new segments are formed faster during the
regeneration of posterior parts of the growing worm. In

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/61

this case the frequency of animals expressing Nvi-Cad is
higher and transcripts can be detected more easily (Fig.
3f).
To summarize: along the zone of newly formed segments
short-term and weak expression of Nvi-Cad occurs in a few
segments, expression of Nvi-Gsh is stronger and occurs in
older segments, and Nvi-Xlox expression occurs in more
developed segments and lasts longer than that of Cad or
Gsh (Fig. 3). Thus, the spatio-temporal dynamics of postlarval Nvi-ParaHox expression are very similar to those of
larval stages (Fig. 2; Fig. 3). Moreover the antero-posterior
positions of Nvi-ParaHox positive cells in each postlarval
segment are also very similar to the pattern of these genes
in the second and third larval segments (Fig. 2d, l, t; Fig.
3).
Expression of N. virens ParaHox genes during formation
of the digestive tract
Overview of gut formation
The digestive tract of N. virens is not complete until late in
the nectochaete stage. Prior to this the larvae are lecithotrophic.

The foregut of polychaetes is derived from stomatoblasts
[41,47]. During blastopore closure, the stomatoblasts of
Nereis virens divide rapidly and form first the stomodaeal
arch, and then the stomodaeal plate. The stomodaeal arch
transforms later into the mouth, the stomodaeal plate
forms the stomodaeal cavity or stomodeum by invagination. Later several sections are formed in the stomodeum:
the buccal capsule, pharynx, and esophagus; the latter is
connected with two large esophageal glands.
The midgut of polychaetes may be divided into a stomach
and an intestine proper, but in Nereis virens the stomach is
very small or may not be present [49]. The first endodermal cells can be seen during the middle trochophore
stage. These cells are formed by unequal division of very
large macromeres rich with yolk. Early in midgut formation groups of endodermal cells are spread over macromeres at the vegetal pole and the episphere. These
endodermal cells are easily distinguished: they are large
and contain brown pigment granules (Fig. 4b). Midgut
formation is complete by the end of larval development at
the nectochaete stage. At this time the nectochaete starts
active feeding.
The hindgut (proctodaeum) is very short and connects the
anus and the midgut. Anlagen of the hindgut, pygidium,
and growth zone are determined during the trochophore
stage from different parts of the somatic plate. These three
zones are located near each other at the vegetative pole
and are surrounded by the telotroch.

Expression of Nvi-Gsh during formation of foregut and midgut
By the late trochophore stage Nvi-Gsh expression is activated in wide lateral domains of the forming stomodeum
(Fig. 2a; Fig. 4a). The intensity of expression rises until the
early metatrochophore stage, when these zones become
wider (Fig. 2b; Fig. 4b). During the metatrochophore and
nectochaete stages the Nvi-Gsh expression level gradually
decreases (Fig. 2d, e; Fig. 4c, d). Expression in the stomodeum completely disappears in later nectochaete stages
(Fig. 4e).

Actively feeding late stage nectochaetes have some separate large Nvi-Gsh positive cells in the intestine (Fig. 4e).
Similar large separate cells were found in different individuals containing from 4 to 25 segments in the basal
layer of the intestine (Fig. 5a, b). As the midgut elongates
the number of large Nvi-Gsh positive cells diminishes in
the anterior part of the midgut and increases in the posterior. The number of these cells is distributed as a gradient
along the intestine. In the growing worm Nvi-Gsh expression also occurs in the posterior half of the midgut in the
epithelial layer of the intestine. At the ends of this domain
the level of Nvi-Gsh expression is lower then in the central
part: the zone of expression appears to be a double gradient in which the gene is expressed highly in the center
while decreasing to the termini of the expression zone
(Fig. 5a).

(f-i) Initial expression is visible in the forming posterior
endodermal domain. (i) At the nectochaete stage the gene is

Later, after formation of the through-gut, Nvi-Xlox is
expressed throughout the entire endoderm. (k-o) Expression of Nvi-Cad. (k, l) Initial expression occurs in the proctodaeum. (m-o) Later, during midgut formation, expression is
also visible in the posterior region of the intestine.

Expression of Nvi-Xlox during midgut formation
The first endodermal cells can be seen at the middle trochophore stage (80–85 h). They form small cell groups
inside the vegetative and animal zones of larvae. Weak
Nvi-Xlox expression was found only in the vegetative zone
20 hours later at the late trochophore/early metatrochophore stage (Fig. 4f, g). During the metatrochophore and
nectochaete stages this gene is expressed only in the posterior part of the forming midgut (Fig. 4h, i).

As postlarval stages begin Nvi-Xlox expression becomes
stronger throughout the midgut, and is strongest in the
central and posterior part of the intestine except at the
most posterior end (Fig. 4j). This pattern resembles the
future postlarval one. During postlarval development in
the anterior half of the intestine an antero-posterior
expressional gradient forms; in the posterior half there is
a double gradient in which expression is highest in the
center of the domain and decreases towards each end (Fig.
5c, d). In the most posterior part of the gut separate single
Nvi-Xlox positive cells can be detected (Fig. 5d).
Expression of Nvi-Cad in posterior regions of the digestive
gut and pygidium
During almost the whole of embryogenesis and larval
development Nvi-Cad is intensively expressed in the ectodermal anlagen of the pygidial lobes, proctodaeum, and

growth zone. These zones are surrounded by the telotroch. The pygidial anlage is situated near the ventral side
and this domain is characterized by the earliest Nvi-Cad
expression (40 h). Much later (100–105 h) the expression
of Nvi-Post2 (an Nvi-Hox cluster posterior gene) occurs in
the same zone [18]. The proctodael anlage is near the dorsal side of the embryo and does not express Nvi-Post2. The
invagination of the proctodaeum starts during the late tro-

chophore stage and coincides with intensive expression of
Nvi-Cad in this zone (Fig. 4k, l). At the end of the metatrochophore stage the process of midgut formation is ongoing, the midgut joins with the proctodaeum, and Nvi-Cad
transcription is activated in midgut cells (Fig. 4m). NviCad expression in the posterior part of the midgut and in
the proctodaeum is maintained and intensified during the
nectochaete stage (Fig. 4n).

whole midgut (Fig. 6c, c'), and then decreases (24 h, 72 h)

Discussion
Holland [10] and Garcia-Fernandez [4] have suggested
that the origin of the Bilateria, with three germ layers, was
associated with the origin of several gene clusters in the
ANTP family: the Hox-cluster genes participated mainly in

Page 10 of 18

BMC Developmental Biology 2008, 8:61

regionalization of the neuroectoderm, the NK-cluster
genes took part in patterning the mesodermal layers, and
ParaHox patterned the endoderm. However, previous to
our work on N. virens, no bilaterians are known in which
all three ParaHox genes participate in patterning of the
gut.
In deuterostomes the patterning of the digestive system is
clearly different from the ancestral state since the mouth
forms in a different position in deuterostome embryos,
thus changes in the function of genes controlling development of the gut are not unexpected. In deuterostomes all
three ParaHox genes are found, but Gsx is not, or is no
longer, expressed in the anterior of the gut [10].
All three ParaHox genes have been found in a number of
lophotrochozoan taxa [20,24,25,50], but expression of
the full set has to date been described only for the polychaete Capitella sp. I [20]. In this species Gsx is also not
expressed in the gut, but is, as in many other bilaterians,
associated with brain development.
Are ParaHox genes expressed ancestrally in the brain?
Gsx is expressed in the brain during development of all
bilaterians studied to date, including N. virens. Nvi-Gsx is
activated early, during the middle trochophore stage, in
dorso-lateral regions of the head neuroectoderm. Expression of this gene is intensive, prolonged, and dynamic
(Fig. 1). Maps of presumptive brain anlagen for a related
species, Platynereis dumerilii [45] can be correlated with
development in N. virens and allow us to locate Nvi-Gsx
expression domains with optic areas and possibly with
regions of prospective antennae. In another polychaete,
Capitella sp. I, CapI-Gsx is also expressed in the head neuroectoderm, and is indeed the only expression domain for
this gene in that species [20].

In D. melanogaster the Gsx homologue, ind, is expressed in
a subset of brain neuroblasts [51]. Ci-gsx in the ascidian
Ciona intestinalis was found in the sensory vesicle, which
is thought to be homologous to the vertebrate forebrain
and midbrain [33]. AmphiGsx is expressed in the cerebral
vesicle in amphioxus [8]. Gsh1 and Gsh2 of the mouse
take part in patterning of the telencephalon, particularly
in the lateral ganglionic eminence and the olfactory bulb
[52-54]. Gsh-1 of the mouse and Ol-Gsh1 of the medaka,
Oryzias latipes, have similar expression patterns in the
optic tectum, dorsal diencephalon, hypothalamus, and
rostral telencephalon [55,56]. Thus Gsx expression has
been observed in the brain of all three major branches of
the Bilateria.
The Gsx homologue anthox2 in Nematostella vectensis
(Anthozoa), which is a basal representative of Cnidaria, is
expressed around the oral pole in scattered ectodermal

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/61

cells that are probably neural cells [14,57]. In another
diploblast, the coral Acropora millepora, the Gsx homologue cnox-2Am is also expressed in ectodermal (probably
neural) cells of the oral region [58]. Thus in Bilateria and
Cnidaria Gsx is expressed in neural cells, and may have an
ancient role in patterning the neural system of the ancestral bilaterian [14,57,58].
We also observed that very weak and transitory Nvi-Xlox
expression occurs in the episphere of the trochophore and
in the cerebral ganglion of the N. virens nectochaete. These
early expression domains do not correlate with any identified brain anlagen or with zones of Nvi-Gsh expression
(Fig. 1).
In the polychaete Capitella sp.I Cap-Xlox expression is not
detected in head neuroectoderm or any other derivatives
of the brain [20]. The Xlox homologue of the rat, IDX1/IPF
is expressed in several areas of the developing brain,
including the cortex, ganglionic eminence, hypothalamus, and inferior colliculus [59,60]; and Ci-IPF1, the Xlox
homologue in the acsidian Ciona intestinalis, is expressed
in the larval sensory vesicle [34].
Nvi-Cad is not expressed in the brain of Nereis virens at any
studied developmental stage. In Capitella sp.I CapI-Cdx
expression was detected in multiple domains of the developing larvae. CapI-Gsh and CapI-Cad areco-expressed in
neuroectoderm during the early stages of brain development [20].
In sum, ParaHox genes are expressed in the brains of all
studied bilaterian animals but in none of them are all
three genes expressed. Expression in the head neuroectoderm is always found for Gsx and is probably the ancestral
characteristic for the last common bilaterian and cnidarian ancestor. The two other ParaHox genes are not always
expressed in the head neuroectoderm: Xlox is expressed in
a few studied species, and Cdx in only one, the polychaete
Capitella sp. I; we cannot at present make any hypotheses
regarding their ancestral expression patterns in the brain,
and await further data.
Expression of ParaHox genes in the trunk neuroectoderm
Expression of all three ParaHox genes in ventral, or dorsal,
neuroectoderm has not been demonstrated in any studied
species. Mice, humans, and probably Xenopus as well, have
only one ParaHox cluster, Gsh1, Ipf1, (= Pdx1, = Xlox), and
Cdx2; as well as two additional orphan Cdx genes (Cdx1
and Cdx4) and one orphan Gsx gene (Gsh2) [7,61]. Gsh-1
of the mouse (and Ol-Gsh1 of the medaka fish) is
expressed in the hindbrain [55,56]. It has been shown that
Gsh1 as well as Gsh2 take part in dorso-ventral patterning
[27,62]. The Gsx homologue in D. melanogaster, ind, also
takes part in dorsoventral specification of the nerve cord

Page 11 of 18

BMC Developmental Biology 2008, 8:61

[27]. IDX1/IPF1 (Xlox) of the rat is also expressed in the
hindbrain at embryonic day 15 [59].
All three mouse Cdx genes are expressed in the posterior
of the neural tube, and their expression domains overlap
considerably [63,64]. In zebrafish there is no Cdx expression in the progenitor cells of the hindbrain, but loss of
function of Cdx1 and Cdx4 or gain of function of Cdx4
result in displacement of the hindbrain-spinal cord
boundary (i.e. a homeotic transformation). These genes
may determine axial regionalisation in the trunk neural
cord [65].
In amphioxus AmphiGsh is not expressed in the trunk neuroectoderm, AmphiXlox is expressed in pigment cells, and
AmphiCdx in the most posterior region of the neural cord
[8]. Ci-IPF1 (Xlox) of Ciona intestinalis is expressed in the
visceral ganglia, which are thought to be homologous to
the vertebrate hindbrain/spinal cord region [34]. In
another ascidian, Herdmania curvata, Hec-Cdx is expressed
in the posterior of the neural tube [32].
All three ParaHox genes are found in the polychaete
Capitella but only one gene, Capl-Cdx, is expressed in posterior neuroectodermal cells [20]. Platynereis dumerilii (a
polychaete) also has a full set of ParaHox genes (our
unpublished data for Pdu-Xlox; ref. [46] for Pdu-Gsh; and
ref. [66] for Pdu-Cad)). Pdu-Gsx is expressed in a central
part of the larval ventral neuroectoderm (Pdu-nk2.2 positive domain) in which somatic serotonergic motoneurons
are identified and differentiated. Pdu-Gsx is also expressed
at late stages of neuroectoderm formation and is associated with cell differentiation. An ordered disposition of
different zones along the apicobasal axis has been shown
for P. dumerilii: there is a zone of proliferation (more apically), a progenitor zone of postmitotic cells in which neuronal identity genes are expressed, and a zone of
differentiation (more basally) [46]. Platynereis dumerilii
and Nereis virens develop similarly and show identical patterns of Hox gene expression [18]. In N. virens ParaHox
positive cells are situated in the zone of proliferation and
in the progenitor zone (Fig. 2), which we suggest indicates
that these genes take part in cell division and/or cell patterning processes. The expression of the ParaHox genes in
order along the antero-posterior axis also suggests that
these genes have a patterning function in N. virens.
Axial pattern of Nvi-ParaHox gene expression in the
forming neuromeres
To date, the polychaete Nereis virens is the only studied
animal in which all the ParaHox genes are expressed in the
ventral neural system. Nvi-ParaHox gene expression is so
far unique in being metameric: the expression patterns of
each ParaHox gene are found in repeating cell groups of
each larval and postlarval segment, but at different times

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/61

during development. Exceptions are the peristomial and
the first parapodial segments of the larva, where expression of Nvi-Cad is not detected (Fig. 2; Fig. 3). These particular segments will be included in the head of the adult
worm, and their ganglia will differ morphologically and
probably functionally from the rest of the neuromeres.
During larval development
N. virens ParaHox gene expression exhibits spatial collinearity. Figure 7 shows the primary expression of the NviParaHox genes during ventral nerve cord formation. NviGsh is expressed in some cells of all the larval neuromeres;
these cells are located in the most anterior part of each
neuromere. Cells expressing Nvi-Xlox are also expressed in
all neuromeres, but in their central regions, so that the
anterior border of Nvi-Gsh expression is always anterior to
the anterior border of the Nvi-Xlox expression domain.
Nvi-Cad expression occurs in some cells of the second and
third neuromeres and in these neuromeres is posterior to
the anterior-most expression of either Gsh or Xlox. The
spatially ordered distribution of Nvi-ParaHox expression
domains (Fig. 2; Fig. 7) is thus similar to ordered Nvi-Hox
expression in the larval ventral plate [18]. However, Hox
expression domains include all cells of the somatic plate
(ectodermal and neuroectodermal) whereas ParaHox
genes specify small groups of particular neuroectodermal
cells (precursors of motorneurons) in the central part of
the neural plate [46].

By contrast, the Nvi-ParaHox genes do not exhibit temporal collinearity of expression. Nvi-Cad is activated in the
neuroectoderm a little earlier than Nvi-Gsh or simultaneously with it, and Nvi-Xlox is activated later than the two
other genes (Fig. 2). Interestingly, larval Nvi-Hox genes
also lack temporal collinearity of expression: the posterior
gene Nvi-Post2 is expressed earlier then the genes of the
central group: Nvi-Hox7, Nvi-Lox4, and Nvi-Lox2, and NviHox3 is expressed before Nvi-Hox1 [18].
During postlarval development
All Nvi-ParaHox genes are expressed in each segment, but
in different cell groups of the forming neuromere and at
different times during segment morphogenesis. In every
neuromere the spatial domains of Nvi-ParaHox expression
are shifted relative to each other and specify different
groups of neurons along the antero-posterior axis in
apparent accord with the linear position of the genes in
the Nvi-ParaHox cluster [67] (Fig. 7). In this case, however,
collinearity can be seen in every neuromere but not in the
whole trunk.

Nvi-Cad demonstrates the earliest and most transient
expression in the two or three youngest postlarval segments. Expression of Nvi-Gsh and Nvi-Xlox is activated in
older segments, but there are more Nvi-Xlox expressing

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/61

segments than Nvi-Gsh ones, suggesting that Nvi-Xlox
expression is longer lasting than that of Nvi-Gsh. We did
not observe simultaneous expression of all three ParaHox
genes in the same postlarval segment. During postlarval
development a dynamic morphogenetic system is formed
that includes an active growth zone and many segments at
various stages of maturity. The difference in time of activation and down regulation of different ParaHox genes
leads to full segmental separation of their expression
domains.
Axial patterning of ParaHox gene expression in the
digestive system
We show that all three ParaHox genes are expressed in the
digestive system of N. virens. This is the first such report
for any lophotrochozoan taxon. During larval development Nvi-ParaHox gene expression in the gut is also spatially collinear: Nvi-Gsh is expressed in the foregut, NviXlox in the midgut, and Nvi-Cad in the hindgut. As with in
other cell types, however, there is no temporal collinearity. Nvi-Cad expression begins at 40 h, much earlier than
Nvi-Gsh at 100 h, and initial expression of Nvi-Xlox and
Nvi-Gsh is almost simultaneousl. Expression of the different Nvi-ParaHox genes coincides with the period during
which the various digestive tract primordia form, and
these do not form in anterior to posterior sequence. The
late development of the midgut may be a response to the
large yolk resource which is a characteristic of lecitotrophic development. The main regions of Nvi-ParaHox
gene expression during gut formation are shown in Fig. 8.

c) marks cuticular furrows of well developed segments. The
dark blue line (b) marks Nvi-Cad expression in the growth
zone. Nvi-Cad expression in the pygidium is denoted with light
blue (a, b).

During larval development Nvi-Gsh is first expressed in
the foregut, where it is later downregulated and then
expressed in basal cells of the midgut (Fig. 4; Fig. 8). During postlarval development the number of basal cells
increases towards the posterior end of the midgut and the
expression pattern looks like a gradient. We will abbreviate this type of antero-posterior gradient as a-P. Nvi-Gsh
expression in the epithelial layer of the posterior domain
is a two sloped gradient p-P-p (Fig. 5; Fig. 8). During larval development Nvi-Xlox marks the posterior endodermal cells of the forming midgut, and in postlarval
development the expression forms an A-a-p-P-p pattern
along the intestine (Fig. 4; Fig. 5; Fig. 8). Nvi-Cad is
expressed in the forming proctodaeum before and after its
invagination. Later this gene is also expressed in the posterior of the larval midgut and at this time a p-P expression gradient in the midgut starts to form. This pattern is
retained during postlarval development (Fig. 4; Fig. 5; Fig.
8).
During postlarval development, then, the spatial expression pattern of Nvi-ParaHox genes in the digestive system
does not substantially change. As the worm becomes
longer the length of the digestive tract is also increased

and along it all the established gradients are maintained

regional specificity (i) and cell differentiation (ii) along
the antero-posterior axis of the gut.

position of the mouth has changed in this branch of the
Bilateria. Our results, showing that all three ParaHox genes
are expressed in a lophotrochozoan, support the hypothesis that Gsh patterning of the gut has been lost in at least
some of the deuterostomes.

(i) The very rapid reorganization of the Nvi-Cad endodermal expression pattern during regeneration (Fig. 6) points
to a regional patterning function of this gene. We detected
upregulation of this gene in the most posterior part of the
bisected worm as soon as 4 h after amputation. This is not
enough time for dedifferentiation of old cell types and the
differentiation of new ones: we suggest that this is evidence that new positional information is created in old
differentiated cells.

Fröbius and Seaver [20] described the expression patterns
of the ParaHox genes in the polychaete Capitella sp. I. They
did not observe CapI-Gsx expression in the digestive tract,
but did see brief expression of CapI-Xlox in the forming
midgut and expression of CapI-Cad in the posterior part of
the gut. Thus expression of ParaHox genes in Capitella and
their expression in N. virens are very different: this is not
surprising since the two species are phylogenetically distant from one another [35,36].

(ii) It is possible that Nvi-ParaHox genes take part in cell
differentiation. The gradient distribution of different cell
types along the intestine [49] probably coincides with the
gradient expressional patterns of Nvi-ParaHox genes (Fig.
5). For example, the number of secretory and absorptive
cells in the epithelial layer gradually decreases in the posterior part of the gut [49]. This is correlated with the gradual diminishing of Nvi-Gsh and Nvi-Xlox expression and
very high expression levels of Nvi-Cad in the posterior of
the gut; the number of basal cells gradually increases in
the posterior of the intestine, and is correlated with the pP gradient of Nvi-Cad and a-P gradient of Nvi-Gsh in basal
cells of the intestine (Fig. 5; Fig. 8).

Errant nereids are thought to retain many ancestral polychaete characters [37-40]. If this is also true of gene expression then the involvement of all three ParaHox genes in
the development of N. virens may more closely reflect the
ancestral use of these genes, thus supporting the idea that
the three ParaHox genes, like the Hox genes, were ancestrally involved in antero-posterior patterning during bilaterian development.

These expression patterns are similar to patterns of Pdx-1
(Xlox) and Cdx-2 along the small intestine of the adult
mouse. Fang et al. [30] showed that these genes form two
opposite and overlapping expression gradients in this part
of the gut, and that the transcription of some digestive
enzymes is activated by Cdx-2 and repressed by Pdx-1.
Thus two overlapping gradients of upstream regulators
take part in functional regionalization of the small intestine [30].
During mouse embryogenesis Pdx-1 also takes part in the
patterning of the pancreas and the anterior part of the
duodenum. Pdx-1 inactivation results in atrophy of the
pancreas and defects in the anterior part of the duodenum
[68]. Inactivation of Cdx-2 results in homeotic transformation: stomach tissue is induced in the midgut and
hindgut [69]. Moreover Cdx2 is essential for axial elongation in the mouse [63]. Interestingly, all ParaHox genes are
expressed in the pancreas of the adult mouse [70].
During development in two deuterostomes; amphioxus
and the sea urchin, only two ParaHox genes, Xlox and Cdx,
take part in patterning and specification of different
regions of the digestive tract [8,21]. Holland [10] suggested that this function has been lost for Gsh because the

Conclusion
In the Bilateria the role of Hox genes in antero-posterior
axial regionalization is well established, and the ancestral
function of these genes has been in patterning and specification of ectodermal and neuroectodermal anlagen. The
ancestral role of the ParaHox genes is less well established;
it has been suggested that these genes might have a parallel role in antero-posterior patterning in the endodermal
layer of the developing embryo [4,10].
This hypothesis has been partially supported by studies in
deuterostomes and ecdysozoans, but to date there are no
taxa from either group for which all three ParaHox genes
are expressed in developing endodermal tissues: because
one or more ParaHox genes have been either lost or
coopted for other functions. However, in the sole lophotrochozoan taxon studied to date, Capitella sp. I, one of
three genes (CapI-Gsh) has no function in endodermal
patterning. In aggregate, these studies show that all three
ParaHox genes are expressed in some endodermal tissues
in at least some bilaterians, but in no single taxon are all
three genes expressed in endodermal or antero-posterior
patterning.
In this paper we describe the expression patterns of the
three ParaHox genes in another polychaete, Nereis virens,
during formation of the digestive system and the ventral
nerve system. We found that all three ParaHox genes are
expressed during antero-posterior regionalization of the
gut, and that these genes are transcribed along the main

body axis in a collinear order that involves both ectodermal (foregut and hindgut) and endodermal (midgut)
regions of the digestive tract. During ventral nerve cord
formation the ParaHox genes are expressed during specification of some cells in the ganglia of larval and postlarval
segments. The well-ordered expression of these genes
occurs in larval development in accordance with the position of these cells along the main body axis. During postlarval development these genes are expressed in order in
accordance with the position of cells in ganglia along the
antero-posterior axis of each segment. In none of these tissues are the three ParaHox genes expressed following the
rule of temporal collinearity.
The expression of ParaHox genes during antero-posterior
development of the digestive system (ectodermal foregut
and hindgut, and endodermal midgut) suggests that these
genes are actively involved in antero-posterio specification in the N. virens gut. Similarly, the segmental expression of Nvi-ParaHox genes in each neuromere except in
the first parapodial segment, suggests that these genes also
take part in axial specification of ventral neuroectodermal
cell domains. We hypothesize that these expression
domains may be predetermined and directed on the
antero-posterior axis by the Hox genes, whose expression
starts much earlier during embryogenesis, and along the
mediolateral axis by the BMP-regulatory system of the Pax
and NK genes [18,46]. Our results lend support to the
hypothesis that the ParaHox genes, like their sister Hox
genes, are involved in antero-posterior patterning of the
developing embryo, but they do not support the notion
that these genes function only in the patterning of endodermal tissues. Confirmation of the function of the ParaHox genes awaits additional descriptive data from other
taxa, as well functional studies that manipulate gene
expression during development in a lophotrochozoan
taxon.

Methods
Animals
Adult Nereis virens were collected at the Chupa Inlet
Marine Biological Station of St. Petersburg State University, on the White Sea. Mature animals were caught with a
hand net at the water surface during the spawning period
(June and July). Artificial fertilization and cultivation of
the embryos were carried out at 10.5°C (Dondua, 1975).
Cloning of short homeobox-containing fragments of NviParaHox genes
We have previously described the use of degenerate primers complementary to the most conserved motifs in the
homeodomain to amplify Hox genes from N. virens
[18,66]. These screens, using forward primers GARCTIGARAARGARTT (1798C), CTIGARCTIGARAARGA (Fbam),
YTIGARYTIGARAARGART (AN1); and reverse primers

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-213X/8/61

ICGRTTTTGRAACCA (Rxba), CGYTTRTTTTGRAACCA
(Rend), and ATTCATICKICKRTTYTGRAACCAIATYT
(AN2), produce PCR amplicons that are mixtures of different homeobox-containing fragments. We isolated individual sequences by cloning the PCR products into
pBluescript SK+ at the EcoRV restriction site, then growing
and sequencing individual clones. These clones included
the eleven Hox genes that we have previously reported,
and the ParaHox genes that we report herein. It is important to note that each primer pair produces a different
suite of amplified genes, so thorough screens of this type
benefit from the use of many primer pairs. Of the nine different primer combinations that we used we recovered
ParaHox sequences from only four: Nvi-Gsh was obtained
with the 1798C/AN2 primer pair, Nvi-Xlox with AN1/
Rxba and AN1/AN2, and Nvi-Cad with AN1/AN2 and
Fbam/Rend.
The short gene fragments were identified using Wu-BlastX
searches against GenBank. Gene identities were confirmed by additional Blast searches after longer sequences
became available. The sequences have been deposited in
GenBank
with
accession
numbers
AY117546,
DQ206221, and DQ366677.
Cloning of long Nvi-Gsh, Nvi-Xlox, and Nvi-Cad
fragments using inverse PCR and 3' RACE
We used inverse PCR (iPCR) and 3' RACE to extend the
ParaHox gene sequences outside of the short fragments
obtained using degenerate primers. We have described
iPCR in detail elsewhere [71]. Briefly, Nereis virens DNA
was digested with the following restriction endonucleases:
EcoRI, BamHI, HindIII, and AluI, and the DNA fragments
obtained were ligated under conditions that ensured selfligation, resulting in circularized DNA. This DNA was
then used as template for PCR. Pairs of nested primers for
each small fragment of ParaHox gene were constructed in
such a way that the ends of the amplified iPCR fragment
were in the middle of an earlier known sequence. Amplified products were cloned in the T Easy vector (Promega),
then sequenced.

For 3' RACE total RNA was isolated from Nereis virens at
various stages of development using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In
every case RNA was isolated from about 5000 larvae.
Mixed RNA from different larval stages was used as a template for a reverse transcriptase reaction with an oligo-dTuniversal primer. Semi-nested PCR was performed using
the product of the reverse transcriptase reaction as a template with pairs of gene specific forward primers and a
reverse universal primer. Amplified products were cloned
in the T Easy vector (Promega) and sequenced. Primers
designed using these assembled long sequences were used
to generate probes for in situ hybridization by RT-PCR.

Whole-mount in situ hybridization (WMISH)
Samples were fixed with 4% PFA in 1.75×PBS. A detailed
protocol is available upon request. Dig-labeled RNA
probes were prepared according to the manufacturer's
protocol (Roche). Hybridization was carried out at 68°C.
BM-purple (Roche) was used as a chromogenic substrate
to localize the hybridized probe [18,48]. The results were
imaged on a DMRXA microscope (Leica) with a Leica
DC500 digital camera under Nomarsky optics.

Authors' contributions
MAK and TFA collected N. virens at the White Sea. MAK
performed all in situ hybridization experiments, made
photomicrographs, and prepared figures. TFA cloned fragments of Nvi-ParaHox genes, grew larval and postlarval
worms, did the regeneration experiments, and wrote the
first draft of the manuscript. CEC developed PCR and
iPCR protocols, processed and annotated sequences,
assembled GenBank submissions, and edited the manuscript. All authors have read and approved the final manuscript.
