Abstract
Background: Some individuals repeatedly exposed to Human Immunodeficiency Virus do not
seroconvert and are resistant to HIV infection. Here, in a pediatric cohort of HIV seronegative
infants born of HIV-infected mothers, we have studied eight non-breastfed children in whom viral
DNA was detected in their PBMC. Our objective was to assess whether silent infection in these
children can be explained by the presence of integrated viral DNA.
Methods: The presence of viral DNA was corroborated by nested PCR with primers for gag and
the nef/LTR regions of HIV-1. Integration of HIV DNA into the host genome was assessed by an
Alu-LTR PCR. Amplicons were sequenced and phylogenetic analyzes were done.
Results: HIV-1 DNA was detected in the earliest available PBMC sample from all eight infants, and
two of them tested positive for HIV DNA at 2 years of age. Nested PCR resulted in the
amplification of gag, nef/LTR and Alu-LTR fragments, which demostrated that HIV-1 DNA was
integrated in the host cell genome. Each individual has a characteristic sequence pattern and is
different from the LTR sequence of HXB2 prototype virus and other Mexican isolates.
Conclusion: HIV-1 DNA was observed in PBMC from HIV exposed seronegative children in this
pediatric cohort.

Background
Several studies have shown that some individuals repeatedly exposed to Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1
or its antigens are resistant to HIV infection [1-6]. Despite
multiple exposures to HIV, several of these resistant subjects have no detectable anti-HIV IgG antibodies in serum
but instead present high anti-HIV CD4+ cell lymphopro-

liferative activity and strong CD8 cell mediated antiviral
responses [1,2]. Other studies have described rare cases of
HIV-1 exposed seronegative individuals (ES) in whom
HIV DNA has been detected in peripheral blood cells by
PCR. These exposed seronegative individuals include
health care personnel with accidental percutaneous exposure to infected blood, sexual partners of known HIV-1-

infected persons and infants born to HIV-1-infected
mothers [3-6]. In case of the pediatric infections some of
these children appear to have eliminated virus-infected
cells [3], others continue to harbor cells with viral DNA
for prolonged periods of time [4]. These antibody-negative, HIV-1 DNA-positive children have also been called
"silent pediatric infections".
In this study, we report silent pediatric infection in 8 children born from HIV-1-positive mothers. Viral DNA could
be amplified from their PBMC but we observed no evidence of viral replication or anti-HIV IgG antibodies in
serum.

Methods
To examine the potential presence of HIV DNA in seronegative children born to HIV-1-infected mothers of the
Mexico City Reference and Diagnostic Unit HIV Pediatric

Cohort, we selected 8 children on the basis of repeatedly
negative virus culture and a positive HIV DNA PCR result
in our laboratory. The children did not show any HIV/
AIDS related symptoms and had never received antiretroviral treatment. Blood plasma HIV-1 RNA concentration
(viral load) was negative in any children samples. Stored
blood samples from each child were studied at different
ages (Table 1). The study received approval of the Committee for Human Subject Research (Ministry of Health of
México).
To detect HIV-1 sequences in PBMC, two nested polymerase PCR amplifications were used (GAG and nef/LTR).
The initial amplification of DNA was performed using
GAG1-GAG2 (5'TCCACCTATCCCAGTAGGAG3' and
5'GGTCGTTGCCAAAGAGTGAT3') or LTR1-LTR2 primers
[7]. An aliquot (5 µL) of first round PCR product was then
used as a template in a second PCR reaction with GAG3-

children) and for sensitivity (10 HIV copies) was added in
each experiment in order to exclude all non-sensitive
experiments. Different rooms were used for DNA extraction, PCR-buffer preparation, amplification and electrophoresis. Amplicons were never transferred to the area
reserved for unamplified sequences. Thus, we cannot
attribute positive PCR results to contamination. To detect
integrated HIV-1 DNA, 2 µg of DNA were subjected to
amplification by Alu-LTR PCR [8], using the Alu primer
and HIV-1 LTR primer LTR4. After Alu-LTR PCR, a second
round of PCR was performed with an aliquot equivalent

Results
Detection of HIV-1 DNA in exposed seronegative children
HIV-1 DNA was detected by the amplification of GAG and
LTR fragments (Fig. 1). Based on these results, two groups
of patients were observed: in the first group (children P1
and P5), persistent detection of both fragments (GAG and
LTR) in sequential samples were detected; in the second
group (children P2, P3, P4, P6, P7 and P8), in whom GAG
and LTR fragments were detected in early samples, these
viral genes were not detected in subsequent samples.
Integration of the HIV-1 genome detected in exposed
seronegative children
All the PBMC samples with a positive gag and LTR fragment amplification also resulted in amplification of the
Alu-LTR binding sequence (Fig. 1). These results confirmed the presence of HIV DNA and indicated that the
viral DNA detected in the children was integrated into the
host genome. Additionally total mRNA was extracted
from PBMC and HIV-1 mRNA transcripts were amplified
by reverse-transcriptase PCR (data not shown). The complete or unprocessed mRNA was not detected in any children samples.
nef/LTR sequences of eight children have a characteristic
sequence pattern
The nef/LTR regulatory region sequence in the proviral
DNA of the children's cells was obtained and compared to
that of HXB2 prototype virus and consensus sequences of
clades of A, C, and E. All sequences were shown by phylogeny to be more similar to the consensus of clade B (Fig
2). Each individual has a characteristic sequence pattern
and is different from the LTR sequence of HXB2 prototype
virus and other Mexican isolates [7]. Sequential analysis
of nef/LTR sequences of samples of P1 and P2 children
were done and Phylogenetic relationship were estimated.
Sequences of sequential samples of P1 and P2 were
grouped closely in the same cluster, supporting the closely
relationship between these samples (fig 2). A variation of
4% was observed in the region overlapping the nef gene,
between -295 and -121 bp. In contrast, the non-translated
region, between -120 and +80 bp, presented a variation
lower than 2%. These results are similar to data reported
in other studies with AIDS patients [9].

Discussion
Cases of children who appear to have eliminated HIV
infection are rare as most of them reported are due to contamination in the PCR processes. Moreover, these previous studies analyzed only env sequences of viruses
isolated from children with apparent silent infections and
their seropositive mothers, and no phylogenetic relation
was found among the isolates [10]. In our study, the presence of the viral genome was confirmed by amplification
of two different sequences in the conserved Gag/LTR

http://www.virologyj.com/content/3/1/52

regions of the virus. Additionally, PCR contamination in
our study is improbable since DNA extraction, first and
second round amplification and separation of PCR products by electrophoresis were performed in different areas.
Negative control of DNA of Non-Infected PBMC was
included in every reaction and no amplification was
shown (Fig 1).
It is also unlikely that cells from the mother were being a
source of contamination. It has been shown that the passage of infectious agents or cells to the fetus is rather limited [11]. Even though there is some evidence that
bidirectional traffic of cells, including leukocytes, may
occur in human pregnancy [12], the frequency of such
traffic determined was not consistent in previous studies
[13]. Furthermore, in a mouse model the maternal cells
were undetectable after 9 days postpartum [13]. In our
case the earliest sample was taken at 3 month of age, and
thus the presence of mother cells at this time in the children is improbable. Unfortunately It was not possible to
analyze the sequence of the virus of the children's mothers
in order to confirm relatedness. Nevertheless sequences of
the nef/LTR region of the viruses analyzed showed HIV
genetic diversity in our cohort among the children and
with other Mexican virus isolates [7]. Additionally we
demonstrate phylogenetic relationship between the
sequential samples of two children P1 and P2. This agrees
with the amplification of proviral DNA that comes from
the subject, and makes less likely the possibility of contamination.

Conclusion
Our results indicate that the seronegative children studied
here were exposed to HIV and had cells with proviral HIV.
The particularly long period of time of detection of the
viral genome suggests that proviral HIV can be present in
cells with a very long half-life, probably in resting CD4+ T
cells that keep HIV suppressed. Moreover we find no evidence of active or productive infection consistent of HIV
viral load negative results and no detection of unspliced
HIV RNA (data not shown) in any children sample. This
indicates the possibility of dead end infection in patients
that loose proviral DNA. These results suggests an extends
revision in molecular diagnostic of HIV children infection
specific in PCR of HIV DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), and detection of virus by PBMC coculture in peripheral blood from the infant.
