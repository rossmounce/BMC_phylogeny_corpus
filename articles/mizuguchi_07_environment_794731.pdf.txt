Abstract
Background: Thermophilic organisms are able to live at high temperatures ranging from 50 to >
100°C. Their proteins must be sufficiently stable to function under these extreme conditions;
however, the basis for thermostability remains elusive. Subtle differences between thermophilic
and mesophilic molecules can be found when sequences or structures from homologous proteins
are compared, but often these differences are family-specific and few general rules have been
derived. The availability of complete genome sequences has now made it feasible to perform a
large-scale comparison between mesophilic and thermophilic proteins, the latter of which primarily
come from archaeal genomes although a few complete genomes of thermophilic eubacteria are also
available.
Results: We compared mesophilic proteins with their thermophilic counterparts of archaeal or
eubacterial origins independently. This was based on the assumption that in these two kingdoms,
different mechanisms may have been exploited for the adaptation of proteins at high temperatures.
We derived the environment specific amino acid compositions of thermophilic proteins from 10
archaeal and seven eubacterial genomes, by aligning a large number of sequences from thermophilic
proteins with their close mesophilic homologues of known three-dimensional (3D) structure. We
further analysed environment specific substitutions, which lead from mesophilic proteins to either
archaeal or eubacterial thermophilic proteins.
Conclusion: Our comparisons were based on homology-based structural predictions for a large
number of thermophilic proteins. We demonstrated that thermal adaptation in the archaeal and
eubacterial kingdoms is achieved in different ways. The main differences concern the usage of Gln,
Ile and positively charged amino acids. In particular archaeal organisms appeared to have acquired
thermostability by substituting non-charged polar amino acids (such as Gln) with Glu and Lys, and
non-polar amino acids with Ile on the surface of proteins.

Background
Thermophilic organisms are able to live at high temperatures ranging from 50 to > 100°C. They belong either to
the archaeal or the eubacterial kingdom and they have
been subdivided, setting a somewhat arbitrary temperature boundary, into thermophiles and hyperthermophiles. Initially, most archaeal species were isolated
from extreme habitats but it has recently become clear
that archaea, as well as eubacteria, are widespread and
abundant in several diverse niches [1].
Thermophilic organisms are interesting for several reasons and in particular because they are a source of very stable proteins. Understanding the higher-temperature
resistance of thermophilic proteins is essential for the
studies of protein folding and stability, and is critical for
designing efficient enzymes that can work at high temperatures. Although many studies have been carried out for
several decades, it has so far been difficult to identify any
single factor as being primarily responsible for enhancing
thermal stability. This is probably because protein stability is determined by a fine balance between several contributing factors. Moreover, even considering multiple
factors, few general rules have been derived and often
rules derived for one protein family did not apply to other
families.
At least four different approaches have been used to study
the stability of thermophilic proteins: 1) comparing a single thermophilic protein structure with its mesophilic
homologues [2-7]; 2) modifying protein stability by
mutagenesis [8-10]; 3) comparing datasets of high quality
structures from thermophiles and mesophiles [11-13];
and 4) analysing whole genome sequences [14-17].
The analysis of high quality structures would be the most
informative approach if a large dataset were available, but
unfortunately this is not the case. On the other hand, the
analysis of whole genomes can benefit from the increasing availability of large numbers of protein sequences. It
is, therefore, desirable to combine the advantages of both
approaches. This can be achieved by aligning sequences
from thermophilic proteins with their close mesophilic
homologues of known 3D structure. Since structure is better conserved than sequence, the alignment of thermophilic sequences to a homologous structure implies a
likely 3D mapping of the protein sequences in question,
yielding homology-based structural predictions for many
proteins [18].
Aided by the recent progress in genome sequencing, we
compared, in this paper, mesophilic proteins with
archaeal and eubacterial thermophilic proteins separately.
In doing so, we were motivated by the consideration that
different strategies for thermal adaptation might have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/S1/S15

been exploited by organisms evolutionarily distant and
that merging results obtained from thermophilic archaea
and eubacteria might have hindered the previous attempts
to identify the determinants of protein stability. We
derived new general rules for thermal adaptation, specific
to archaea and eubacteria.

Results and discussion
Databases
Two protein databases were created for organisms living
above 50°C. One included 19,168 protein sequences
derived from the genomes of 10 archaea, the other 17,040
protein sequences from the genomes of seven eubacteria.
In Table 1 we report the names of the organisms, the temperature at which they live (OGT) and the GC content of
their genomes. Hyperthermophiles, i.e., organisms that
live above 80°C are more frequently found in the archaeal
kingdom. However, GC content does not correlate with
OGTs and on average, is only slightly higher in eubacteria
than in archaea.

A set of 3763 protein structures belonging to 1057 different families were taken from HOMSTRAD, a database of
protein structural alignments for homologous families
[19]. The sequence corresponding to each structure was
used as a query to search separately against the two databases of thermophilic proteins. We used BLAST [20]
under stringent conditions and detected close archaeal
homologues of 1005 HOMSTRAD proteins and close
eubacterial homologues of 1580 HOMSTRAD proteins.
Accordingly we built 1005 alignments for archaea and
1580 alignments for eubacteria, where the first sequence
from a mesophilic protein is aligned against its thermophilic homologues. The residues of the first protein,
the structure of which is known, were assigned to one of
eight different structural environments; alpha helix,
exposed (HA) or buried (Ha), beta strand, exposed (EA)
or buried (Ea), positive main-chain phi angle, exposed
(PA) or buried (Pa) and coil, exposed (CA) or buried (Ca).
We counted how many times an amino acid from the
mesophilic sequence in a given environment is substituted by another amino acid in the thermophilic
sequences (or is conserved). The total number of substitution counts was 3,011,344 for archaea and 4,432,631 for
eubacteria.
For a comparison, we used alignments of mesophilic proteins stored in HOMSTRAD and counted how many times
an amino acid from the mesophilic sequence in a given
environment is substituted by another amino acid in
homologous mesophilic sequences (or is conserved).
Amino acid composition
We counted the occurrence of each amino acid to derive
the compositions of thermophilic proteins (of archaeal

and eubacterial origins) and compared them with that of
mesophilic proteins (Fig. 1) using a modified version of
SUBST (K. Mizuguchi, unpublished).
Charged amino acids, more precisely, Lys in eubacteria,
Arg in archaea, and Glu in both kingdoms, are more abundant in thermophilic proteins than in their mesophilic
counterparts. Interestingly, Asp and His are not more
abundant in either thermophilic group. As already
reported [14,16,17], in thermophilic proteins the higher
percentage of charged amino acids is compensated by the
lower percentage of polar, non-charged amino acids (Ser,
Thr, Asn, and Gln). However, we observed subtle differences between eubacteria and archaea; compared to mesophiles, Asn and Ser are significantly under-represented
only in thermophilic eubacteria. Gln is under-represented
in both eubacteria and archaea but more strongly in
archaea.
It was proposed that Asn and Gln are avoided in thermophilic proteins because of their chemical instability at
high temperatures due to deamidation [16]. Yet the deamidation of proteins occurs primarily at Asn residues,
except in very long-lived proteins, where Gln deamidation
is also observed [21]. If the chemical instability at high
temperatures were the sole cause of avoiding Asn and Gln,
Asn should be under-represented more strongly than Gln

in both eubacterial and archaeal thermophilic proteins.
The observed under-reprentation of Asn (and Ser) only in
eubacteria and that of Gln only in archaea requires an
alternative explanation.
These differences may be explained by the proposal that
processes other than selection due to biochemical properties of the amino acids affect the patterns of amino substitution between mesophiles and thermophiles [22]. In
addition to biochemical properties and the G/C content
of their codons, amino acids differ in their cost of uptake,
synthesis or incorporation into proteins. If these bioenergetic costs vary among domains, different patterns of
amino acid substitutison can be observed between different pairs of mesophiles and thermophiles.
The under-representation of Gln in archaea is consistent
with its bioenergetics. Glutaminyl-tRNA synthase is
absent in archaea but is present in some eubacteria, while
asparaginyl-tRNA synthase is absent in some eubacteria
and archaea. In the organisms without Gln- and Asn-tRNA
synthases, the inclusion of Asn and Gln into proteins
involves the formation of mis-acylated Asp-tRNA(Asn) or
Glu-tRNA(Gln), and their subsequent amidation catalysed by amidotransferases [23]. In thermophilic archaea,
which lack Gln-tRNA synthases, Gln appears to be underrepresented because of its instability at high temperatures

and the cost of incorporating it into proteins. However,
the previously reported negative correlation between the
content of Gln and OGTs [24] still poses a question. The
list of complete microbial genomes at NCBI currently contains only one fully annotated psychrotolerant archaeon
(Methanococcoides burtonii). A proper explanation, therefore, awaits future investigation.
About aliphatic hydrophobic amino acids, we observe
that Ala, Leu and Val are over-represented in thermophilic
eubacteria, whereas in archaea only the beta branched
amino acids, Ile, and to a lesser extent, Val, are over-represented. As already reported [12,18], thermo-labile Cys is
under-represented in thermophiles of both archaeal and
eubacterial origins. This suggests the possibility of a significant evolutionary pressure against Cys being conserved
(assuming that thermophilic proteins evolved from mesophilic proteins) or being introduced (assuming that thermophilic proteins did not evolve from mesophilic
proteins) unless it plays a structural (e.g., disulphide-

bonded) or functional (e.g., metal-binding or catalytic)
role. Trp is another potentially thermo-labile amino acid
that is under-represented both in archaeal and eubacterial
proteins.
Environment specific amino acid composition
We inferred the secondary structure and the accessibility
of the thermophilic proteins by aligning them to the mesophilic proteins of known structure. In Table 2 we report
the amino acid compositions in the different environments considered. Strictly speaking, we show the amino
acid composition of the regions of thermophilic proteins
that were aligned against residues of the mesophilic
homologues in alpha helix (HA, exposed or Ha, buried),
in beta strand (EA, exposed or Ea), in coil (CA, exposed or
Ca, buried) or with positive phi angles (PA, exposed or Pa,
buried). The environments with the smallest differences
between mesophilic and thermophilic proteins are PA
and Pa, where the preference for Gly was very high and no
large differences were observed for the other amino acids.

Mes stands for amino acid composition of mesophilic proteins, t_arc for amino acid composition of thermophilic archaeal proteins and t_eu for
amino acid composition of thermophilic eubacterial proteins. HA stands for exposed alpha helices, Ha for non exposed alpha helices, EA for
exposed beta strands, Ea for non exposed beta strands, CA for exposed coil and Ca for non exposed coil. The third letter is the standard code for
amino acids. Values in bold significantly differ (P < 0.01) between thermophilic and mesophilic proteins.

For this reason the tables for residues with positive phi
angles are not shown.
In general, the environments, in which we observed significant differences between thermophiles and mesophiles, are those exposed and in particular, exposed

coils. In these environments, polar, non-charged amino
acids are under-represented in thermophiles, whereas
charged amino acids are over-represented.
Ion pairs stabilize proteins at high temperature more
strongly than at low temperature [25-27] and desolvata-

tion energy is lower for exposed charges than for buried
ones [28]. We suggest that a large number of exposed
charged amino acids can stabilise proteins at high temperatures, because they are able to form extended networks of
ion pairs.
Below, we report several specific observations. In archaeal
alpha helices, we observed a significant increase of Ile
accompanied by a decrease of Ala on the exposed surface
and a decrease of Leu on the buried surface.
On the surface of beta strands, we noticed that archaea
prefer Ile and eubacteria prefer Val, both amino acids
being beta branched. Ile is also over-represented on the
buried side of beta strands.
There are contradictory reports concerning Pro. Some
researchers observed that Pro has an increased occurrence
in thermophilic proteins especially in loops [14,29,30].
Others [12,16] found that the frequency of Pro was
unchanged. Our data show that the frequency of Pro does
not change significantly in general, except for a minor,
albeit significant increase in exposed loops of eubacteria.
Environment specific substitution likelihoods
Amino acid composition can be a useful means to identify
thermophilic organisms, but a more ambitious goal is to
predict which substitutions are likely to change a mesophilic protein to a thermophilic one. The conservation of
amino acid residues is strongly dependent on the environment in which they occur in the folded protein. Therefore,
we calculated environment specific amino acid substitution likelihoods using a modified version of SUBST (K.
Mizuguchi, unpublished). For each environment we calculated 20 × 20 substitution likelihoods. Each value represents the likelihood of occurrence and acceptance of a
mutational event of a residue in the mesophilic sequence
and in a particular structural environment, leading to any
other residue in the thermophilic sequences. We compared these values with those representing the likelihood
of occurrence and acceptance of a mutational event of a
residue in the mesophilic sequence and in a particular
structural environment, leading to any other residue in
the mesophilic sequences. We show a list of statistically
significant cases, in which the likelihood of a substitution
leading from a mesophilic protein to a thermophilic
archaeal protein or to a thermophilic eubacterial protein
is different from the corresponding environment specific
amino acid substitution in mesophilic proteins. For the
sake of simplicity, in Table 3 (for archaea) and Table 4 (for
eubacteria) we only show cases in which the difference is
statistically significant (P < 0.01) and large (|Δ| > 2). All
statistically significant cases are also provided in additional files 1 and 2.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/S1/S15

As already observed in Table 2, major differences between
thermophiles and mesophiles are observed in exposed
environments. The substitutions that more frequently
lead from mesophilic proteins to thermophilic proteins
are those of polar, non-charged amino acids with Glu and
Lys (in archaea) or with Arg (in eubacteria). In archaea, we
also observe frequently the substitution of non-polar
amino acids with Ile. The role of Ile is striking, since more
than one third of the substitutions that lead from mesophilic to thermophilic archaeal proteins involve this
amino acid. Substitutions of hydrophobic amino acids
with Ile are highly frequent, in particular in the environment of exposed alpha helices. Ile is generally preferred to
the gamma branched Leu, even in alpha helices and to the
smaller beta branched Val. No hydrophobic amino acid
has such prevalence in the case of eubacterial thermophilic proteins. Since the average nucleotidic composition does not differ significantly in the genomes of the
archaea and eubacteria considered (Table 1), the abundance of Ile cannot be explained only by the fact that it is
coded by triplets very rich in A/T (ATA, ATT and ATC).

Conclusion
One reason to study naturally occurring thermostable
proteins is to learn how mesophilic proteins of biotechnological interest can be stabilised. In this context, it is reassuring to observe that differences between thermophilic
and mesophilic proteins occur primarily in solvent accessible surfaces. This suggests a possible strategy for enhancing the thermal stability of proteins: mutagenesis of
exposed residues is in fact usually better tolerated by proteins, whereas mutagenesis of buried residues, even when
rationally designed, can often lead to the misfolding of
the protein of interest. By calculating the likelihood of
substitutions that lead from mesophilic to thermophilic
proteins, a simple and potentially useful trend for biotechnology was recognised in archaea, where polar, noncharged amino acids are preferentially substituted by Glu
and Lys and non-polar amino acids by Ile.
Considering substitutions that lead from mesophilic to
thermophilic proteins, we refer only to the fact that we
aligned thermophilic proteins to their mesophilic homologues of known structure; by no means we want to imply
that thermophilic proteins have evolutionarily derived
from mesophilic proteins (or vice versa). Thermophiles
are located at the deepest positions within the phylogenies of both prokaryotic domains. This observation led to
the hypothesis of the hot origin of life but the matter is
complex and still disputable [31]. Our data suggest that
different strategies for thermal adaptation might have
been exploited by archaea and eubacteria.

Mes stands for mesophilic proteins, t_arc for thermophilic archaeal proteins, HA for exposed alpha helices, Ha for non exposed alpha helices, EA
for exposed beta strands, Ea for non exposed beta strands, CA for exposed coil and Ca for non exposed coil. Data are shown only if P < 0.01 in the
two-tailed t-test and if the difference between mes and t_arc are, in absolute value, larger than 2. Environment specific amino acid substitutions with
higher likelihood values in mesophiles-thermophilic than in archaeal homologues are in italics, those with higher likelihood values in mesophilesmesophiles homologues are in bold. Data are sorted by increasing differences between mes and t_arc.

Methods
Protein sequences for 10 thermophilic archaeal and seven
thermophilic eubacterial genomes, as well as their GC
content and optimal growth temperatures (OGTs), were
obtained from the NCBI genome site [32]. These were the
only thermophiles whose genomes had been completed
and stored in this database at the time of investigation; we
arbitrarily chose one species when two or more organisms
belonging to the same genus were available.
The dataset of mesophilic structures was created from
HOMSTRAD [19] available at HOMSTRAD site [33].

Each sequence in the dataset of mesophilic proteins was
used as a query to search separately against the databases
of thermophilic archaeal or eubacterial sequences. We
performed gapped BLASTP searches in PSI-BLAST mode
with the BLASTPGP [20] program using the following
parameters: j, the maximum number of rounds was set to
2, h, the e-value threshold for including sequences in the
score matrix model, was set to 0.000000001 and e, the
final e-value was set to 0.000001. The same program produced the alignment of the query mesophilic sequence
with its thermophilic homologues.

The first sequence of each alignment thus produced was a
mesophilic protein of known 3D structure and its secondary structure/main chain conformational states and solvent accessibility were calculated by JOY [34]. Residues
with side-chain relative accessibility higher than 7% were
defined as accessible, otherwise inaccessible.
We modified (K. Mizuguchi, unpublished) the program
SUBST available at SUBST site [35], which had been used
to derive the environment specific substitution tables for
the homology recognition software FUGUE [36]. The
modified version of SUBST can now count amino acid
substitutions between a protein of known structure and its

homologous sequences. Observed amino acid replacements at aligned positions were counted in terms of the
local environment of the first sequence (i.e., the mesophilic protein of known 3D structure). Let FENMT be the
number of times the amino acid M of the mesophilic protein in the environment EN was replaced in thermophilic
proteins by the amino acid T. The raw substitution counts
were converted into substitution frequencies ENMT as:
ENMT= FENMT/∑t FENMt. E generically refers to secondary
structure/main chain conformation; specifically 'H' indicates alpha helices, 'E' beta strands, 'P' residues with a positive phi angle and 'C' coils. N generically refers to solvent

Two-tailed t-tests for independent samples were carried
out to identify statistically significant (P < 0.01) differences between the values calculated for thermophilic proteins and the reference mesophilic proteins. The
alignments built for archaeal proteins were randomly
divided into four sets. For each set, environment specific
amino acid compositions and substitutions were calculated. The means of these values were calculated to produce the final results. Similarly, the alignments built for
eubacterial proteins and the control alignments of mesophilic proteins were each divided into four sets and the
mean values of the amino acid compositions/substitutions were calculated. Differences between the means of
two groups (e.g., thermophilic archaea and mesophiles)
were then tested (with six degrees of freedom).
