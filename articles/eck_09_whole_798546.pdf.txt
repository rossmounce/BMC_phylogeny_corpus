<p>The next generation
SNP detection in cattle sequencing of a single cow genome with low-to-medium coverage has revealed 2.44 million new SNPs.</p>

Abstract
Background: The majority of the 2 million bovine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
currently available in dbSNP have been identified in a single breed, Hereford cattle, during the
bovine genome project. In an attempt to evaluate the variance of a second breed, we have
produced a whole genome sequence at low coverage of a single Fleckvieh bull.
Results: We generated 24 gigabases of sequence, mainly using 36-bp paired-end reads, resulting
in an average 7.4-fold sequence depth. This coverage was sufficient to identify 2.44 million SNPs,
82% of which were previously unknown, and 115,000 small indels. A comparison with the
genotypes of the same animal, generated on a 50 k oligonucleotide chip, revealed a detection rate
of 74% and 30% for homozygous and heterozygous SNPs, respectively. The false positive rate, as
determined by comparison with genotypes determined for 196 randomly selected SNPs, was
approximately 1.1%. We further determined the allele frequencies of the 196 SNPs in 48 Fleckvieh
and 48 Braunvieh bulls. 95% of the SNPs were polymorphic with an average minor allele frequency
of 24.5% and with 83% of the SNPs having a minor allele frequency larger than 5%.
Conclusions: This work provides the first single cattle genome by next-generation sequencing.
The chosen approach - low to medium coverage re-sequencing - added more than 2 million novel
SNPs to the currently publicly available SNP resource, providing a valuable resource for the
construction of high density oligonucleotide arrays in the context of genome-wide association
studies.

Background

The bovine reference genome sequence assembly resulted
from the combination of shotgun and bacterial artificial chromosome sequencing of an inbred Hereford cow and her sire
using capillary sequencing. Most of the more than 2 million
bovine SNPs deposited in dbSNP represent polymorphisms
detected in these two Hereford animals [1]. Recently, Van
Tassell et al. [2] contributed more than 23,000 SNPs to the
bovine SNP collection by next-generation sequencing of
reduced representation libraries. The study involved 66 cattle
representing different lines of a dairy breed (Holstein) and
the 7 most common beef breeds (Angus, Red Angus, Charolais, Gelbvieh, Hereford, Limousin and Simmental). These
SNPs together with SNPs deposited in dbSNP were used to
compile arrays with up to 50,000 SNPs. The arrays have been
used to implement a new approach to animal breeding,
termed genomic selection [3,4]. Although this approach has
been applied successfully to predict breeding values in dairy
cattle, the underlying SNP resource is far from complete. SNP
selection for the Illumina BovineSNP50 array, for instance,
has been optimized to provide high minor allele frequencies
(MAFs) for the Holstein breed. The full extent of common
SNP variation in Holstein and other breeds is still unexplored. Although the average r2 between adjacent markers of
the BovineSNP50 array is greater than 0.2 - the minimal linkage disequilibrium required for genomic prediction to be sufficiently accurate - there is a considerable number of marker
pairs with an r2 of zero [3]. Since preliminary data indicate
that the extent of linkage disequilibrium in cattle breeds is
only slightly larger than in humans, it has been estimated that
up to 300,000 SNPs will be necessary to achieve optimal
marker coverage throughout the cattle genome [5-8].
Circumventing any pooling or enrichment protocols, we
sequenced just a single Fleckvieh animal to identify a large
number of candidate SNPs. We demonstrate that this
approach represents an effective strategy towards a comprehensive resource for common SNPs.

Results and Discussion
Sequencing and alignment
The genomic DNA sequenced in this study was obtained from
a single blood sample of a Fleckvieh breeding bull. Wholegenome sequencing was performed on an Illumina Genome
Analyzer II using three different small-insert paired-end
libraries. We generated 36-bp reads on 44 paired-end lanes
and 9 single-end lanes, resulting in 24 Gb of mappable
sequence. Of the aligned bases, 87% had a phred-like quality
score of 20 or more, as calculated by the ELAND alignment
software [9]. To account for the varying read quality, we
trimmed the ends of reads when necessary to a minimum of
32 bases. Read mapping, subsequent assembly and SNP calling were performed using the re-sequencing software MAQ
[10]. Apparently duplicated paired-end reads (7.6%) were
removed. Of the paired-end reads, 605,630,585 (93.6%) were

successfully mapped in mate-pairs to the assembly bosTau4.0
from October 2007 [11], which has a length of 2.73 Gb. Additionally, 23,872,053 of paired-end reads (3.6%) were mapped
as singles. Of the 25,808,311 single-end reads, 93.2% could be
aligned to the genome. Together, 98.0% of the genome
(98.1% of the autosomes and 93.9% of the X chromosome)
was covered by reads resulting in a 7.4-fold coverage across
the entire genome (7.58-fold across the autosomes and 4.13fold across the X chromosome) and a 6.2-fold sequence depth
using only the uniquely aligned reads. The final distribution
of mapped read depth sampled at every position of the autosomal chromosomes showed a slight over-dispersion compared to the Poisson distribution giving the theoretical
minimum (Figure 1a). Part of this over-dispersion can be
accounted for by the dependence of the read depth on the GCcontent, which had a maximum average read depth at
approximately 57% GC-content (Figure 1b) [9,12].

SNP and indel detection
We focused our further analysis on SNP identification. We
applied stringent criteria in order to keep the false-positive
detection rate low. An outline of the analysis procedure, comprising SNP identification and validation, is given in Figure 2.
SNPs were called with the MAQ software. Using mainly the
default parameters, particularly a minimum read depth of 3
and a minimum consensus quality of 20, SNPs could be
assessed in sequence reads, which together comprised 68%
(1.87 Gb) of the genome. To exclude sequencing artifacts that
we have observed in other experiments, the output of MAQ
was further filtered using custom developed scripts. These
artifacts include cases where all sequenced variant alleles at a
given position are only indicated by reads from one strand
and have a lower than average base quality at the variant position. We required for a SNP call that the average base quality
is ≥20 and that at least 20% of the reads are from opposite
strands. Using these parameters, the MAQ software called
2,921,556 million putative SNPs, which were reduced by our
custom filters to a final set of 2.44 million SNPs.
Of these SNPs, 1,694,546 (69.4%) were homozygous and
749,091 (30.6%) were heterozygous. The low proportion of
heterozygous SNPs is mainly due to the relatively low
sequence depth and our stringent SNP calling requirements.
The rate of heterozygous SNP detection is expected to rise
with increasing coverage (Additional data file 1). It has been
estimated that at least 20- to 30-fold coverage is needed to
detect 99% of the heterozygous variants [10].
We further performed a genome-wide survey of small insertion and deletion events (indels). Indels called by MAQ were
only retained if they were indicated by at least 10% of highquality reads from each strand. This criterion was applied to
exclude possible sequencing artifacts and resulted in the
identification of 115,371 indels (68,354 deletions and 47,017
insertions). The majority of them had a length of 1 to 4 bp,
with the largest having a length of 15 bp (Figure 3).

windows of 500 bp.

Next we compared the identified SNP and indel variants with
those already published. Since the dbSNP set is not yet
mapped to the bosTau4 assembly, we compared our findings
with the 2.08 million SNPs mapped by the Baylor College
Bovine Genome Project. The comparison showed that 18%
(451,914) of the SNPs were shared between both sets (Table
1).

Analysis procedure. Sequence reads were aligned to the reference
sequence (bosTau4) by the MAQ software. SNPs were called and filtered
by MAQ and custom scripts, resulting in a final set of 2.44 million SNPs.
Comparison with 25,726 array-based genotpyes revealed a false-negative
detection rate of 49%. A false-positive detection rate of 1.1% was
determined by comparison with 196 randomly selected SNPs genotyped
with MALDI-TOF spectroscopy. By determining the false-positive
detection rate in 75 coding SNPs with high coverage (≥16), we found
evidence that the high false-positive detection rate in these SNPs is due to
mapping errors caused by duplications that are not reflected in the
reference sequence rather than to sequencing errors.

6,292 SNPs in untranslated regions. Additionally, 203 indels
were located in coding regions, with almost all of them (201)
causing a frame-shift in the corresponding gene. The remaining two indels comprise single amino acid deletions.

We used the RefSeq (9,518 genes) and Ensembl (28,045
genes) gene sets to functionally annotate the detected variants (Table 1). Using the RefSeq genes as reference, we found
7,619 coding SNPs (3,139 leading to non-synonymous amino

8114 SNPs in untranslated regions. Furthermore, we identified 425 indels in Ensembl annotated coding regions. Most of
them (414) cause a frame-shift in the reading frame of the
associated gene, 9 indels lead to single amino acid deletions
and 2 were single amino acid insertions.

Comparison of sequence and array results
We assessed the accuracy and completeness of the sequencebased SNP calls by comparing them with the genotypes of the
same animal generated with an Illumina BovineSNP50 array.
This chip contains 54,001 SNPs, of which 48,188 map to the
current assembly (bosTau4). Of those, 48,025 SNPs were successfully genotyped; 22,299 homozygous calls exhibited the
reference allele, leaving 12,043 homozygous and 13,683 heterozygous SNPs that were different with respect to the reference sequence assembly. We used these 25,726 positions

We first estimated the proportion of concordant calls. Of the
12,043 homozygous array-based calls that differed from the
reference sequence, 8,974 (74.51%) were also called by MAQ.
In 8,949 (99.72%) of these positions, both platforms showed
concordant genotypes. Of the 13,683 heterozygous arraybased calls, MAQ called only 5,882 (42.98%) positions, and
only 4,157 (70.67%) of these matched the array results (Table
2). The false-negative rate of sequenced SNPs as judged from
the array experiment is therefore 26% (100 - 8,949/12,043)
for the homozygous variants and 70% (100 - 4,157/13,683) for
the heterozygous genotypes. Based on these estimates, the
investigated genome contains 2,289,927 homozygous and
2,496,970 heterozygous SNPs. The combined false-negative
rate would be 49% (100 - (8,949 + 4,157)/(12,043 + 13,683)),
which is more than expected from simulation studies at a
sequence depth of 6 to 7.4 [10].
We then determined the disagreements in more detail, which
are composed of the 1,750 discordant calls plus the 16 positions where MAQ called a SNP while the genotyping result
was identical to the reference sequence (Table 3). Of the 1,766
disagreements, 1,720 were heterozygote under-calls of MAQ.
'Heterozygote under-call' denotes a homozygous sequencing
SNP at the position of a heterozygous genotyping SNP where
the sequencing SNP corresponds to one of the two heterozygous genotyping alleles. For 10 of the remaining 46 differing positions, a heterozygote call was made by MAQ whereas
the genotyping array only showed the reference allele, indicating a possible heterozygote under-call by the array. At one
of these positions the array tests for a different variant allele
than the one detected by MAQ (chip result CC, chip test alleles
CT, MAQ CG, reference C). At 15 positions the platforms
showed different homozygous genotypes that both differed
from the reference genotype. At 21 positions we observed
other differences. Assuming that these 46 SNPs are wrong
calls, the false-positive rate would therefore be 0.16% (46 out
of 25,742).
We also estimated the autosomal nucleotide diversity π taking
into account that we identified only 30% of the heterozygous

SNPs correctly. This led to an autosomal nucleotide diversity
of approximately 9.4 × 10-4 or 1 SNP per 1,060 bp ((749,091 3,553)/0.30/(2.73e9 - 88,000,000) [(Heterozygous_SNPs X_chromosomal_SNPs)/Detection_rate/(Genome_length X_chromosome_length)]). This value is higher than the
nucleotide diversity observed in humans [9,13] but in accordance with previous estimates in Fleckvieh [14,15]. To assess
the nucleotide diversity in coding regions, we constructed a
non-redundant gene set based on the Ensembl genes by
merging all transcripts from the same gene into a single 'maximum coding sequence', resulting in 22,796 non-redundant
genes. According to this set, the total coding sequence length
for cattle is 33,235,846 bp, or 1.21% of the genome. This coding region contained 8,438 heterozygous SNPs, resulting in a
nucleotide diversity of 8.5 × 10-4 or 1 SNP per 1,181 bp (8,438/
0.30/(33,235,846)).

and 104 heterozygous SNPs from genomic regions, defined by
uniquely aligned reads, and genotyped them using multiplex
MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
time-of-flight) mass spectrometry. Contigs that were not allocated to a specific chromosome were excluded. The distribution of read depth of the selected SNPs was similar to that of
the entire SNP set (Additional data file 2). To enable design of
the extension primer, we did not allow for other SNPs to occur
20 bp upstream and downstream of the target SNP. In addition, we masked all other SNPs in the 200-bp fragment used
for the design of the amplification primers. Genotypes could
be successfully determined for 196 assays, with an average
call rate of 98.3% (Table 4). We detected ten disagreements,
eight of which were heterozygous sequencing under-calls,
which were not considered for the calculations. These undercalls are expected due to inadequate sampling of alleles when
sequencing at a fairly low coverage level. On that basis, the
false-positive discovery rate was calculated to be 1.1% (2 of
186).
To estimate the population frequencies, we assayed the same
SNPs in 48 Braunvieh and 48 Fleckvieh bulls that were
selected to be not closely related (Additional data file 3). Two
SNPs turned out to be singletons only present in the bull that
had been sequenced and seven were monomorphic for the
variant allele. The mean MAF of the remaining 187 SNPs was
24.5%. The distribution of the minor allele frequency of tested
SNPs was nearly uniform (Figure 4) [16]. The distribution
shows that 83% of the SNPs had a MAF of 5% or more, which
makes them suitable for association studies using common
SNPs in these breeds.

under-call by MAQ (array based genotype heterozygote, MAQ based
genotype homozygote). Seq-het>GT-hom indicates a possible
heterozygote under-call by the array (array-based genotype
homozygote for the reference allele, MAQ based genotype
heterozygote). Different homozygotes denote homozygous genotypes
on both platforms that both differed from the reference genotype.
Different heterozygotes denote heterozygote genotypes on both
platforms where one allele differs. Seq-SNP>GT-Ref indicates a MAQ
based genotype that differs from the reference sequence while the chip
based genotype displayed only the reference allele.

exclude random noise. It was further noticeable that several
of the false-positive SNPs were located near gaps or in regions
with several gaps, suggesting assembly difficulties. Although
we can not provide an unequivocal explanation for the high
false-positive rate of SNPs in regions with high read depth, we
want to point out that these errors do not compromise the
overall false-positive detection rate of 1.1%. Rather, it reveals
that a significant proportion of heterozygous false-positives
are not caused by sequencing errors but, most likely, by erroneous alignment and that the risk for this type of error is negatively correlated with the quality and completeness of the
reference sequence. This information can be used to further
filter the SNP set. Discarding all SNPs with a read depth ≥16
would reduce the set by 53,259 SNPs (2.2%).

Genotypes of 196 SNPs were determined by MALDI-TOF mass
spectroscopy in 48 Fleckvieh and 48 Braunvieh bulls.

In an attempt to select SNPs specifically from coding regions,
we selected 75 SNPs only from regions with high sequence
depth (≥16) under the assumption that sensitivity and specificity should gain from higher coverage. Because only 5.8% of
coding SNPs had a sequence depth of 16 or more, several
SNPs were located in close proximity. Contrary to our expectation, comparison with MALDI-TOF genotypes resulted in a
false-positive rate as high as 24% (18 of 75). All these SNPs
were called as heterozygotes by MAQ. Of these SNPs, 11 were
called as homozygotes by MALDI-TOF genotyping in all 96
investigated animals. The remaining 7 were counted as falsepositives because they were called as heterozygotes by
MALDI-TOF genotyping in all 96 investigated animals. These
sites were also ambiguous when checked by capillary
sequencing in 12 selected animals (Additional data file 4). We
therefore suspected that the selection from the extreme of
coverage has introduced a strong bias. The false-positive calls
were most likely caused by reads that were misassembled
because these regions are duplicated but only one copy is contained in the reference sequence. Checking the read depth
around the false-positive SNPs, we found 3 SNPs
(chr4_117247234, chr4_117247581, chr13_16920248) that
were obviously located in regions of 30 and 300 kb with high
average read depth, indicating a duplication of that region
(Additional data file 5). In the other regions, the high read
depth extended only across a short distance so that we can not

By sequencing a single diploid genome to a depth of 7.4-fold,
we were able to generate more than 2 million SNPs, thereby
almost doubling the existing SNP resource in cattle. We evaluated the error rates of SNP detection in detail, point out possible sources of errors and propose means for filtering errorprone SNPs. We deduced an overall false-positive detection
rate of 1.1% from genotyping 196 randomly selected SNPs by
an alternative technique. This value compares well with the
reported false-positive detection rate of 2.5% estimated by
genotyping 1,206 SNPs by a similar approach [9]. Despite a
false-negative detection rate of 49%, which is largely
explained by missing heterozygous SNPs at low sequencing
coverage, SNP identification was very effective. In contrast to
the detection of SNPs and small indels, the identification of
structural variations at a size that exceeds the individual read
length was ineffective at low sequence depth. In addition to
SNP discovery, this sequence of a single animal constitutes a
first step towards a haplotype reconstruction of the Fleckvieh
breed. The animal selected for this approach was a prominent
Bavarian Fleckvieh bull. With more than 50,000 inseminations in 2008 alone, the selected animal is founder of a very
large pedigree. Fleckvieh is a dual purpose breed (dairy and
beef) originating from the Swiss Simmental breed. Fleckvieh
cows contribute about 8% of all recorded lactations worldwide, which makes them the second largest dairy breed after
Holstein. Fleckvieh, together with the Brown breed, are so
called Alpine breeds that are phylogenetically distant from
Holstein [17]. The distribution of genotypes found for 196
SNPs in 48 Brown and 48 Fleckvieh animals proved our chosen strategy to be successful. We provide a comprehensive
SNP list for the two main Alpine breeds Brown and Fleckvieh.
For a future dense array with up to 1 million SNPs, the experiment provides SNPs that can be translated into genome-wide
oligonucleotide arrays in a single-step procedure with a conversion rate of more than 80%. The chosen strategy is predicted to be applicable to complement the SNP resource in
other farm animals such as swine and chicken, especially with
sequencing outputs from a single experiment predicted to
cross the 100 Gb threshold before the end of 2009.

191658 and genomic DNA was extracted according to standard protocols. DNA was sheared by nebulization with compressed nitrogen gas. We constructed 3 different paired-end
libraries with median insert sizes of 75, 80 and 170 nucleotides. The libraries were sequenced on a GAII (Illumina, San
Diego, Californica, USA). Sample preparation, cluster generation and sequencing were performed according to the manufacture's protocols with minor modifications (Illumina
paired-end cluster generation kit GA II v1, 36-cycle sequencing kit v1).

Data access
Sequence data are available from the European Read Archive
(ERA) [ERA:ERA000089]. SNPs have been submitted to
dbSNP ([dbSNP:ss140006985] to [dbSNP:ss142339932]).

Abbreviations

Indel: small insertion/deletion event; MAF: minor allele frequency; MALDI-TOF: matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight; SNP: single nucleotide polymorphism.

Analysis software
We used the bosTau4.0 assembly as reference sequence
including the scaffolds that were not anchored onto specific
chromosomes. Image analysis and ELAND alignment was
performed with the Pipeline software version 1.0 as provided
by Illumina. Subsequently, short read alignment, consensus
assembly and variant calling were performed using the resequencing software MAQ version 0.6.8 [10]. For the alignment part, we used the following parameters: number of maximum mismatches that can always be found = 2; mutation
rate between the reference sequence and the reads = 0.001;
threshold on the sum of mismatching base qualities = 70. For
the 'snpfilter' part of the MAQ software, we used the following
parameters: minimum read depth = 3; maximum read depth
= 256; minimum mapping quality = 40; minimum neighboring quality = 20; minimum consensus quality = 20; window
size around potential indels = 3; window size for filtering
dense SNPs = 10; maximum number of SNPs in a window = 2.
After SNP calling by MAQ, we applied additional filters. We
required each putative SNP to have a median quality value of
the variant base of at least 20 and that at least 20% of the
reads covering this position must come from opposite
strands. Functional analysis of the SNPs was performed with
custom Perl scripts using datasets from Ensembl [18], the
Santa Cruz Genome Browser [19] and the Baylor College
Bovine Genome Project web pages [20]. Ensembl and RefSeq
gene annotations were used as provided by the Santa Cruz
Genome Browser (October 2008). SNP locations were downloaded form the Baylor College Bovine Genome Project ftp
site [21].

was conducted within the Synbreed Consortium.

Genotyping
For genotyping, we selected bulls that did not have both sires
and maternal grandsires in common. Genotypes were determined on a BovineSNP50 chip (Illumina). Genotyping of
selected SNPs was performed with the MassARRAY system
(Sequenom, San Diego, California, USA) using the iPLEX
Gold chemistry. For random selection of SNPs we used a random number generator as implemented in the Perl function
'rand'. Assays were designed using AssayDesign 3.1.2.2 with
iPLEX Gold default parameters and up to 25 assays were mul-
