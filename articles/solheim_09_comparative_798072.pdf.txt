Abstract
Background: Enterococcus faecalis, traditionally considered a harmless commensal of the intestinal
tract, is now ranked among the leading causes of nosocomial infections. In an attempt to gain insight
into the genetic make-up of commensal E. faecalis, we have studied genomic variation in a collection
of community-derived E. faecalis isolated from the feces of Norwegian infants.
Results: The E. faecalis isolates were first sequence typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST)
and characterized with respect to antibiotic resistance and properties associated with virulence. A
subset of the isolates was compared to the vancomycin resistant strain E. faecalis V583 (V583) by
whole genome microarray comparison (comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)). Several of the
putative enterococcal virulence factors were found to be highly prevalent among the commensal
baby isolates. The genomic variation as observed by CGH was less between isolates displaying the
same MLST sequence type than between isolates belonging to different evolutionary lineages.
Conclusion: The variations in gene content observed among the investigated commensal E.
faecalis is comparable to the genetic variation previously reported among strains of various origins
thought to be representative of the major E. faecalis lineages. Previous MLST analysis of E. faecalis
have identified so-called high-risk enterococcal clonal complexes (HiRECC), defined as genetically
distinct subpopulations, epidemiologically associated with enterococcal infections. The observed
correlation between CGH and MLST presented here, may offer a method for the identification of
lineage-specific genes, and may therefore add clues on how to distinguish pathogenic from
commensal E. faecalis. In this work, information on the core genome of E. faecalis is also
substantially extended.

Background
Enterococci are Gram-positive facultative anaerobic cocci
with a low GC-content. They are natural inhabitants of the
mammalian gastrointestinal (GI) tract and among the

first lactic acid bacteria to colonize the intestines of a newborn [1]. During the last three decades, enterococci have
emerged as important pathogens and as a major cause of
nosocomial infections. The majority of hospital-acquired,

enterococcal infections is caused by Enterococcus faecalis
[2]. Several putative virulence factors have been characterized in E. faecalis (reviewed in [2]), and their roles in pathogenicity have been established in various animal models
[3-6] and cultured cell lines [7,8]. A large number of
reports on enterococcal pathogenicity has focused on the
presence or absence of these virulence determinants in
enterococcal isolates from different origins [9-14]. The
results have shown that several of the putative virulence
traits are detected in enterococcal isolates independent of
their origin, suggesting that these factors may not be crucial for enterococcal pathogenicity. However, a higher
incidence of some of the virulence determinants in clinical isolates may indicate that these genes enhance the ability of E. faecalis to cause disease, as suggested by virulence
studies on bacterial mutants in animal models [3].
The sequencing of the E. faecalis V583 genome (V583)
[15] made global analyses of whole genome diversity
within this species possible [16-18], by the use of microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH).
The approximate size and composition of the E. faecalis
core genome have been investigated on clinical, food and
environmental isolates [17,18]. The CGH-approach has
also been used to evaluate the dissemination of variable
traits from the V583 genome within diverse lineages of the
species [17]. Previous analyses have shown that the main
genomic variation between the strains correspond to previously identified mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in
V583 [17,18]. However, an effort to explore the gene content of commensal E. faecalis by CGH has not previously
been made and little is known about genetic determinants
that may explain the differences in life style between pathogenic and non-pathogenic E. faecalis strains.
The aim of this study was to investigate the genomic diversity among fecal E. faecalis isolated from healthy Norwegian infants by means of CGH. In an attempt to study
genetic variability of commensal E. faecalis isolates, we
used genome-wide DNA arrays to probe the presence of
3219 open reading frames (ORFs) from V583 and 10
ORFs representing a 17-kb deletion in the V583 pathogenicity island in our collection of community-derived
Norwegian fecal E. faecalis baby isolates. The isolates were
also characterized with respect to antibiotic resistance and
properties associated with virulence, by PCR and phenotypic assays.

Methods
Stool samples
This study included 11 healthy Norwegian infants (7 male
and 4 female) born in the Eastern part of Norway. The
babies were all born in Oslo and Akershus Counties.
Informed consent had been obtained from their parents.
From infants A-C, stool samples were collected once each

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/194

month during the first six months and once after 12
months from October 2004 to September 2005, while
from infants D-K, samples were collected once during the
first six months of life during 2002. All the samples were
collected after mother and child had left the obstetric
ward. All the infants were born by vaginal delivery and all
were breast-fed during the period of sampling. None of
the infants were treated with antibiotics during the sampling period. A total of 29 stool samples were collected.
Identification of enterococcal isolates and growth
conditions
From each stool sample, two cultures were prepared: 1 g
fecal material was homogenized in 1) 10 mL deMan-Rogosa-Sharpe (MRS; Oxoid) broth and 2) 10 mL Arroyo,
Martin and Cotton broth (AMC; [19]), by vortexing. Serial
dilutions were made and 100 μl of the 10-5 – 10-7 dilutions
were plated on MRS- and AMC agar plates, respectively.
MRS plates were incubated aerobically over night (ON) at
37°C, while AMC plates were incubated anaerobically
ON at 37°C. Plates were then examined for growth, and
colonies with different morphology and from different
plates were picked and inoculated in 5 ml MRS- or AMCbroth, depending on which plates they were isolated
from. The cultures were incubated as described above.
Genomic DNA from each sample was isolated, and for
identification, the 16S rRNA gene from each isolate was
amplified and sequenced using general 16S rDNA primers
(Additional file 1). PCR was accomplished using
DyNAzyme™ II DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes). Thermocycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at 94°C; followed
by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 56°C, and 1.5 min at
72°C; followed by 10 min at 72°C. A total of 31 different
E. faecalis-isolates were identified, and further analyzed in
this study (Table 1). The 31 enterococcal isolates were isolated as part of two surveys of the content of lactic acid
bacteria (LAB) in baby feces, hence, the culture media
used were rich media, not particularly chosen to select for
enterococci. In the present study, E. faecalis were grown
aerobically ON in brain heart infusion broth (BHI;
Oxoid) at 37°C.
MLST analysis
MLST was performed according to the scheme presented
by Ruiz-Garbajosa et al. [20], using the ABI Prism Big dye
Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI PrismTM 3100 Genetic Analyzer.
Sequence types were defined by the allelic variation at the
seven loci aroE, gdh, gki, gyd, pstS, xpt and yqiL. Isolates
with the same sequence type are thought to be members
of a single clone or lineage. Clonal complexes were
defined as groups of isolates that differed in no more than
two of the seven loci analyzed, by use of eBURST http://
www.mlst.net[21]. Each clonal complex was designated
after its ancestor sequence type (ST) or the representative

were placed at 4°C for 5 h. Zones of turbidity around colonies indicated hydrolysis of gelatin.

Phenotypic assays
Cytolysin assay
Hemolytic activity was qualitatively detected by the use of
blood agar plates supplemented with 5% (v/v) defibrinated horse blood, 1% (w/v) glucose and 0.03% (w/v) Larginine (Sigma) [22]. Overnight cultures were diluted
1:100, spotted onto fresh plates and incubated at 37°C for
24 h. Zones of clearing around colonies indicated production of cytolysin.

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
BHI agar plates supplemented with 4 μg/ml ampicillin, 20
μg/ml chloramphenicol, 50 μg/ml erythromycin, 500 μg/
ml gentamicin, 10 μg/ml tetracycline or 4 μg/ml vancomycin were used. The plates were inoculated by spotting
5 μl (106–107 CFU) overnight culture (1: 200) and incubated at 37°C overnight. Growth was interpreted as resistance to the antibiotic added to the medium.

Gelatinase assay
Detection of gelatinase activity was performed by the use
of Todd-Hewitt (Oxoid) agar plates containing 3% gelatin
[23]. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:100, spotted onto

Detection of genes encoding virulence factors and bacteriocin genes
The presence of ace, agg, esp, cylL and gelE were detected by
means of polymerase chain reactions (PCR) as previously
described [9,24]. Isolates were also tested for the presence
of iolE, iolR and genes coding for the following bacteriocPage 3 of 11

ins by PCR: enterocin A (EA), enterocin B (EB), enterocin
P (EP), enterolysin A (EN), enterocin L50 (EL50) and
enterocin 1071A and B (E1071A&B). Thermocycling conditions were as follows: 2 min at 94°C; followed by 30
cycles of 30 s at 94°C, 30 s at 50 ± 10°C, and 30 s at 72°C;
followed by 10 min at 72°C. Primers are listed in Additional file 1.
API 50 CH for determination of fermentation patterns
Carbohydrate fermentation patterns were obtained for
selected isolates with API 50 CH kits (BioMerieux) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Comparative genomic hybridization
Microarrays
The microarrays used in this work contained 3219 open
reading frames from the genome of Enterococcus faecalis
V583 [15] represented by oligonucleotides (70-mers;
probes). Of these 3219 ORFs, 3093 were chromosomal
ORFs and 126 were located on plasmids. In addition, ten
genes from the pathogenicity island (PAI) of E. faecalis
MMH594 (deleted in the PAI of V583) were represented
[25]. The 70-mer oligos were supplied by Invitrogen. The
oligos were spotted in triplicates onto epoxy-coated glass
slides (Corning). In order to reduce biases due to positional effects, the replicate spots were spotted at random
positions within a subarray on the array. Alien reporter
sequences (SpotReport®Alien® Oligo Array Validation System, Stratagene), without homology to any known
nucleic acid sequences in public databases, were spotted
as negative controls on the array. The microarray design
has been deposited in the ArrayExpress database with the
accession number A-MEXP-1069.
DNA isolation
For CGH, 9 isolates were chosen based on their representation of MLST sequence type diversity across the babies
and of novel sequence types. Genomic DNA was isolated
by using the FP120 FastPrep bead-beater (BIO101/
Savent) and the QiaPrep MiniPrep kit (Qiagen) as follows: 10 mL overnight cultures were centrifuged for 5
min. at 6000 rpm in an Eppendorf 5804R tabletop centrifuge at 4°C, and pellets were resuspended in 250 μl RNaseA-containing Buffer P1 (100 μg/mL RNaseA). The cell
suspensions were transferred to 2 mL screw cap FastPrep
tubes (Qbiogene) containing 0.5 g acid-washed glass
beads (< 106 μm) (Sigma). Cells were lysed by shaking
the tubes for 20 s at 6 m/s in the FastPrep bead-beater.
After a short spin, lysed cells were transferred to Eppendorf tubes and 250 μl Buffer P2 and 350 μl Buffer N3 was
added to each tube. Then, the suspensions were centrifuged for 10 min. at 13000 rpm in a tabletop centrifuge
(Biofuge Pico, Heraeus) at room temperature, before the
supernatant fluids were loaded on to Qiaprep spin columns. The columns were washed again and genomic DNA
was eluted according to the Qiaprep Spin MiniPrep kit

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/194

protocol. Concentration and purity of the genomic DNA
was measured using the NanoDrop spectrophotometer
(NanoDrop Technologies). 5 μg genomic DNA was used
for each labeling reaction.
Fluorescent labeling and hybridization
Genomic DNA was labeled and purified with the BioPrime Array CGH Genomic labeling System (Invitrogen)
and Cyanine Smart Pack dUTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Purified samples were then dried, prior to resuspension in
140 μl hybridization solution (5 × SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS,
1.0% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 50% (v/v) formamide
and 0.01% (w/v) single-stranded salmon sperm DNA)
and hybridized for 16 h at 42°C to the E. faecalis oligonucleotide array in a Tecan HS 400 pro hybridization station
(Tecan). Arrays were washed twice at 42°C with 2 × SSC +
0.2% SDS, and twice at 23°C with 2 × SSC, followed by
washes at 23°C with 1) 0.2 × SSC and 2) H2O. Two replicate hybridizations (dye-swap) were performed for each
test strain. Hybridized arrays were scanned at wavelengths
of 532 nm (Cy3) and 635 nm (Cy5) with a Tecan scanner
LS (Tecan). Fluorescent intensities and spot morphologies
were analyzed using GenePix Pro 6.0 (Molecular Devices),
and spots were excluded based on slide or morphology
abnormalities. All water used for the various steps of the
hybridization and for preparation of solutions was filtered (0.2 μM) MilliQ dH20.
Data analysis
Standard methods in the LIMMA package [26] in R http:/
/www.r-project.org/, available from the Bioconductor
http://www.bioconductor.org were employed for preprocessing and normalization. Within-array normalization was first conducted by subtracting the median from
the log-ratios for each array. A standard loess-normalization was then performed, where smoothing was based
only on spots with abs(log-ratio) < 2.0 to avoid biases due
to extreme skewness in the log-ratio distribution. For the
determination of present and divergent genes, a new
method that predicts sequence identity based on array signals was used, as described by Snipen et al. [27]. A brief
description of the method follows: Initially, all array
probe sequences were queried against the fully sequenced
V583 reference genome (R-genome) in a BLAST search.
The value Rb for each probe was defined as the number of
identical bases in the best local alignment found by
blastn, divided by the probe length. Given the sequence
identity Rb for each probe, the corresponding array signal
Ra will in general correlate in a positive way, i.e. stronger
sequence identity yields stronger array signal. This postulation also holds for the unsequenced sample genome (Sgenome), where Sa denote the array signal and Sb the
unknown sequence identity. The basic idea is that Sb can
be predicted from Sa based on how sequence identity Rb

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:194

and array signal Ra relate to each other. A threshold of
0.75 was assigned to the Sb-values in order to obtain a categorical response of presence or divergence, i. e. genes
with Sb-value > 0.75 were classified as present, while
genes with Sb-value < 0.75 were classified as divergent. In
a comparison with other methods for analyzing CGH data
as reviewed by Carter et al. [28], the proposed method
gave significantly better classification of present/divergent. Based on the fully sequenced genomes of V583 and
OG1RF [15,29], tests gave sensitivity of 0.99 and specificity of 0.95 for detecting present probes based on CGH
data.
Comparative phylogenomics
The relationship of the reference strain and the test strains
based on the presence and divergence of genes was determined with Bayesian-based algorithms implemented
through MR BAYES 3.1 [30], as previously described [31].
With samples and saves from every 40th tree, 1.1 × 106 generations of four incrementally heated Markov chain
Monte Carlos (MCMC) were performed on the CGH data
by using an annealing temperature of 0.5, a burn-in of
100 000 MCMC generations and an 8-category distribution. Consensus trees and clade credibility values were visualized by using TreeView version 1.6.6 http://
taxonomy.zoology.gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html.
Microarray data accession number
The microarray data have been deposited in the ArrayExpress database with the series accession number E-TABM466.

Results
MLST – allelic variation in community-derived fecal E.
faecalis baby isolates
The MLST analysis was performed on 31 E. faecalis-isolates, obtained from 11 healthy Norwegian infants during
their first year of life. These isolates were considered as
legitimate representatives of commensal E. faecalis as they
have been resident in the gut without causing any apparent negative effect to the health of the host. Infants A-C
were sampled once each month during the first six
months and once after 12 months, and a total of 8, 5 and
5 different isolates were recovered from the respective
infants over the period of sampling. Infants D-K were
sampled once during the first six months of life and 1–3
different isolates were obtained from these infants. From
the 31 isolates, 12 different sequence types (STs) were
identified, of which four were novel STs (ST161, ST162,
ST163 and ST194; Table 1). Of these novel STs, ST161 and
ST162, were single-locus variants (SLV; differing from the
ancestor ST in one allele) of ST64 and ST72, respectively.
ST64 and ST161 belong to the previously defined clonal
complex CC8. In addition to the ST161 (n = 1) isolate that
was detected in one of the infants, three different isolates

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/194

displaying ST64 (n = 3) were obtained from the same
infant (A) during the same month. Other clonal complexes that were represented within our collection of isolates were CC2 (n = 2), CC30 (n = 6), CC44 (n = 6) and
CC55 (n = 1). The remaining isolates were singletons.
Several STs were detected multiple times, within different
infants: ST30 was found in 5 of the 11 infants, while ST44
occurred in three different infants, and ST16 and ST162
were both detected in two different infants. The number
of different STs for the three infants (A-C) monitored over
12 months, ranged between 2 and 4. Some of these STs
were detected only for a short period of time, while other
STs persisted throughout the sampling period (Figure 1).
No E. faecalis isolates were obtained from infant A and C
at 12 months of age. This observation was probably due
to the conditions for enterococcal selection not being
stringent enough.
Distribution of virulence genes, bacteriocin genes and
antibiotic resistance profiles
Single-concentration plate assays were used to assess
resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin,
gentamicin, tetracyline and vancomycin (see Table 1 and
Additional file 2). Tetracycline resistance was the most
prevalent resistance trait among the baby isolates (17/31).
Moreover, a few of the isolates (n = 4) showed erythromycin- or high-level gentamicin resistance. All isolates were
also examined for the presence of the putative virulence
factors ace, agg, cylL and esp by means of PCR. ace was
amplified from all isolates, while 27/31 isolates were agg+.
esp is known to be associated with the E. faecalis pathogenicity island (PAI) [25], and was detected in 20/31 of
the isolates. Cytolysin has been shown to contribute to

virulence in animal models of enterococcal infections,
and cylL, encoding one of the structural subunits of enterococcal cytolysin was present in 16/31 of the isolates by
PCR. Cytolysin production was detected in 9/31 of the
isolates on blood agar plates. The isolates were also examined for gelatinase activity, which have been associated
with virulence (reviewed in [2]). 15/31 isolates were gelatinase positive (GelE+). Since the absence of the regulator
(fsrB) can cause a lack of the gelatinase phenotype despite
the presence of a positive gelE genotype [23], the isolates
were also tested for the presence of gelE and fsrB by PCR.
29 of the isolates were gelE+ and 18 were fsrB+ (see Table 1
and Additional file 2). PCR-screening for content of bacteriocin genes among the test strains further discriminated
between isolates with matching resistance profiles and virulence characteristics (see Additional file 2).
Comparative genomic hybridization analysis
Whole-genome CGH experiments on E. faecalis have previously shown that the main variations between the
sequenced reference strain V583 and test strains relate to
regions coding for integrated phages, plasmids and transposable elements in V583 [17,18]. In our experiments,
169 genes were classified as divergent in all 9 isolates, 121
of which are chromosomal genes in V583 (see Additional
file 3). The majority of the divergent chromosomal genes
are located within the following 6 previously identified
mobile genetic elements (MGE) in V583: efaC2 (EF0127–
66; n = 19), phage01 (EF0303–55; n = 9), phage03
(EF1417–89; n = 16), vanB resistance region as defined by
[17] (EF2284–2334; n = 48), efaC1 (EF2512–46; n = 17)
and phage07 (EF2936–55; n = 6). A large fraction of the
121 chromosomal genes code for hypothetical proteins (n
= 70) or conserved hypothetical proteins/conserved
domain proteins (n = 35). Apparently, a great proportion
of the variable gene pool consists of hypothetical ORFs
and this seems to be a common trait among prokaryotes
[32]. None of the MGEs were entirely divergent in all of
the commensal isolates, e.g. the content of PAI genes in
the isolates varied from 36 to 118 present genes of the 123
PAI ORFs represented on the array (Figure 2), and similar
patterns of present and divergent genes between isolates
may suggest that MGE genes are often transferred in modules. The fact that only 48 of the plasmid-encoded genes
on the array (n = 167; pTEF1, pTEF2 and pTEF3) were
divergent in all the baby isolates is consistent with such an
evolutionary scenario; however, the isolates have not
been tested for plasmid content to further explore this
hypothesis. The results of the microarray analysis were
generally consistent with the phenotypic tests and the
PCR analysis of the presence of virulence-associated
genes, with a few exceptions only: the isolate 111A was
esp+ by PCR, but esp- by CGH. The same isolate was also
cylL+ by PCR and Cyl+, but the entire cytolysin locus,
except from PAIef0049, was divergent by CGH. The Cyl+

phenotypes of the isolates 158B and 189 were also inconsistent with the CGH data for some of the additional PAI
genes on the array (PAIef0047–49). The observed inconsistencies between phenotypes/PCR and CGH may be due
to sequence variations in the microarray-probe target
sequences in the test stains.
Each of the fecal baby isolates showed a minimum of
76.5% presence of probes represented on the array
(76.6% of the V583 genome). The CGH analysis classified
2092 of the 3093 chromosomal V583 ORFs as present in
all 9 isolates. This set of shared genes is slightly higher
than the core genomes that were previously reported for E.
faecalis [17,18], probably due to the constricted environment and the limited geographical area, from which the
isolates were obtained. The observed genetic variation
among the investigated commensal E. faecalis shows that
the genetic diversity is comparable to that among strains
from other sources (food, clinical, environmental, animal
husbandry etc) [17,18]. Our data confirmed the establishment of phage02 as a part of the E. faecalis core genome.
The E. faecalis V583 genome contains 35 probable phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase
(PTS) systems and pathways for exploitation of 15 different sugars have been predicted [15]. Carbohydrate fermentation patterns obtained with API 50 CH kits for
selected baby isolates whose gene content were also analyzed by CGH (see Additional file 4), showed only small
differences in the metabolic capabilities of the test strains.
Also, compared to API 50 CH results previously obtained
for V583 [18], only minor variations were observed (see
Additional file 4). These observations were supported by
the high degree of conservation of genes encoding PTS
components revealed by the CGH data. The recent publication of the E. faecalis OG1RF genome sequence revealed
an iol operon that is not found in the V583 genome [29].
Interestingly, two of the baby isolates (111A and 105)
were, according to the API assay, able to ferment myoinositol. All the baby isolates were therefore surveyed for
the presence of iolE and iolR by PCR. A total of 13 isolates,
including 111A and 105, were both iolE+ and iolR+ (see
Additional file 2). The presence of a partial iol operon in
isolates 189 and 266 which were unable to ferment myoinositol by the API assay is consistent with previous findings [29].
Phylogenomic analyses of the CGH data using Bayesianbased algorithms revealed a distinct clade containing
seven of the nine community-derived baby isolates (Bayesian posterior probabilities [PP] = 1.0; Figure 3A). Initial
branching within this clade was also fairly reliable (PP >
0.80). The remaining three isolates seemed to be more
divergent, and V583 formed a distinct out-group. Based
on this analysis, isolate 266 (ST163) appeared more
closely related to V583 (ST6) than isolate 158B, which

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/194

also displays ST6. Nevertheless, the Bayesian phylogeny
suggested that the lineages defined by CGH generally correlated with those identified by MLST: Within the latter
clade, the isolates 92A and 29C (ST44) formed one separate clade (Figure 3A). To further examine the correlation
between MLST and CGH, additional CGH data obtained
from the literature, in addition to unpublished data from
five additional non-baby isolates of E. faecalis were
included in the analysis. In this extended analysis, only
genes (n = 3043) represented on all three arrays that were
used in the different studies were considered. The clustering of identical STs was here further supported (PP > 0.55;
see Additional file 5). Previous studies have suggested that
genomotyping of E. faecalis by CGH is heavily influenced
by extensive horizontal transfer of MGEs in E. faecalis [17].
To further analyze the effect of MGEs in our data set, the
CGH data were reanalyzed after all core- and MGE genes
had been removed from the gene list, as previously
described [33]. The MGE genes comprised putative MGEs
predicted in V583 [15], as well as an additional phagerelated region identified by McBride et al. [17]. This revision left a list of 370 genes (see Additional file 6). Lindsay
and coworkers [33,34] previously denominated such
genes core variable (CV; all genes minus core genes minus
MGE genes). The phylogenetic tree based on the content
of CV genes in the isolates recovered a clade containing
the same seven baby isolates as in the analysis with the
entire probe set (PP = 0.92; Figure 3B).
Of the 370 CV genes, 145 genes code for hypothetical proteins. Among the remaining functionally annotated CV
genes, many genes are predicted to code for surfaceexposed proteins in E. faecalis, e.g. the cps locus coding
for the capsule in E. faecalis [35]. The cps locus of E. faecalis consists of 11 genes (cpsABCDEFGHIJK) and insertional inactivation of genes in this locus have resulted in
mutants with enhanced susceptibility to phagocytic killing [35]. Three different cps polymorphisms have been
identified in E. faecalis so far: 1) type 2 (cps2) which
includes all 11 genes, 2) type 5 (cps5) which includes all
genes except cpsF and 3) type 1 (cps1) with only cpsA and
cpsB present. All three polymorphisms were detected
among our test strains, by CGH (Table 1). The cps type has
previously been found to be invariant within MLST
sequence types in E. faecalis [17], and our data is consistent with this finding. Analysis of the CGH data with
respect to the cps type suggested that the E. faecalis PAI, or
segments thereof, may be enriched among cps2-isolates.
These observations support the hypothesis of convergence
of enterococcal virulence determinants and cps2 by independent selection in E. faecalis [17].

the leading causes of nosocomial infections [36,37]. The
present study was undertaken in an attempt to further
explore the differences in the genetic make-up of E. faecalis. A total of 31 community-derived fecal baby isolates
were sequence typed by MLST and characterized with
respect to antibiotic resistance and properties associated
with virulence. A subset of the isolates was genomotyped
using genome-wide DNA microarrays.
By MLST analysis, the 31 baby isolates were resolved into
12 STs and grouped into 11 genetic lineages, including 6
major clonal complexes (CCs) and 5 singletons http://
efaecalis.mlst.net/. Analyses with the MLST scheme
employed in the present study have previously defined
distinct clonal complexes of E. faecalis associated with the
hospital environment, so-called high-risk enterococcal
clonal complexes (HiRECC; CC2, CC9, CC40 and CC87)
[20,38]. Of the isolates included in this study, only 158B
and 226B (ST6) grouped into one of these complexes
(CC2). These isolates were obtained towards the end of
the sampling period, and may therefore have been intro-

duced through habituation to solid food or from the environment through fecal-oral contamination. To our
knowledge, none of the infants were admitted to the hospital during the period of sampling, however, hospital
contact cannot be excluded as a source for ST6 isolates.
According to our results, several of the putative enterococcal virulence factors were widespread among the commensal baby isolates. These findings are in line with
previous reports [11], and may reflect the adaptive functions that these factors can hold in non-virulent contexts,
as indicated by Semedo et al. [11]. Several of the virulence
traits and antibiotic resistant phenotypes were common
for all the isolates within the clonal complexes; however,
the strain set is too small to deduce statistically significant
association of features with clonal identity of isolates.
Overall, our results highlight the importance of phenotypic assays to confirm genomics data as revealed by PCR
and CGH. PCR confirmed the presence of cylL in the eight
isolates that displayed hemolytic activity in our study,

Page 8 of 11

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:194

however, cylL was also found to be present in an additional eight Cyl--isolates. A similar discrepancy between
fermentation capabilities and the presence of iolE and iolR
was also observed. Moreover, three isolates carrying both
gelE and fsrB came out as GelE- in the plate assay. The confined genotype-phenotype correlation that is here
reported, visualizes the need for phenotypic confirmation
of genotypes.
esp which is known to be associated with the E. faecalis
pathogenicity island (PAI) [25], was detected in two thirds
of the commensal isolates by PCR. According to the CGH
data, none of the baby isolates contained complete PAIs.
These findings were as expected, considering that the PAI
has been shown to be enriched among infection-derived
enterococcal isolates [25]. More surprisingly, but consistent with a previous report [39], all the isolates studied
contained some PAI genes. Several of the baby isolates
showed similar patterns of present and divergent PAI
genes (Figure 2). This suggests that the evolution of the
enterococcal PAI may be driven by insertion and deletion
of larger modules, as hypothesized in [39]. Shankar et al.
also suggested that parts of the enterococcal PAI originate
from pheromone-responsive plasmids, with subsequent
indels of transposable elements driving the evolution of
the PAI [39]. Indeed, conjugal transfer of a segment of the
E. faecalis PAI has been demonstrated [40]. The CGH
revealed a high degree of plasticity within all the MGEs
represented on the microarray. These "mosaic structures"
may reflect a complex evolutionary history of elements
that have been frequently rearranged by horizontal gene
transfer (HGT) and homologous recombination.
According to the CGH data presented here, a preliminary
E. faecalis core genome consisting of 2092 (out of the
3093 chromosomal V583 ORFs) can be delineated. Compiled analysis of the data from Aakra et al. and McBride et
al. [17,18] with the data from the present study produced
a core genome estimate of 1722 genes. An additional 62
genes were only represented on one or two of the three
different arrays used, but were defined as core genes in
these experiments. Although the size of the core genome
may fluctuate due to the stringency of the statistical methods used in the different studies, our data do add substantial information on the E. faecalis core genome.
In general, the genomic variation between isolates that are
evolutionary -linked, e.g. isolates with the same ST, was
expected to be lower than the variation between isolates
that belong to different evolutionary lineages. Bayesianbased phylogenetic analysis confirmed these expectations
(Figure 3A). McBride et al. previously reported genomotyping by CGH to be biased by the activity of MGEs in E.
faecalis [17], and we therefore repeated the Bayesian analysis, using the CV genes, only. The phylogenetic analysis

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/194

based on CV genes recovered the same patterns of relatedness as the analysis comprising all genes, with slight internal rearrangements of branches (Figure 3B). These
rearrangements supported the hypothesis on the distribution of mobile elements as a source of genomic diversity
in E. faecalis. Moreover, our data suggest that within lineages, most of the variation detected by CGH is due to
MGEs. However, the conserved clade identified by the
analyses based both on the CV genes and the complete
gene-set, indicates that also other and more complex discriminatory factors contribute to the genomic diversity in
E. faecalis. Since an overall correlation between CGH and
MLST was revealed, it is reasonable to believe that genes
contributing to the formation of clades, i.e. lineage-specific genes may be identified. In the 7 baby isolates that
formed a clade in the phylogenetic analysis, we were able
to recognize 137 genes that were divergent, but present in
the remaining three isolates (including the reference
strain). The majority of these genes were MGE genes
located in phage03 (n = 39), phage06 (n = 28) and a
phage-related region identified by McBride et al. [17]
(EF2240–82/EF2335–51; n = 44). Lepage et al. have previously reported phage03 to be absent from several food
isolates [16]. Since ST6 is part of CC2, which has been
found to be significantly enriched among nosocomial isolates, phage03 may potentially represent an element associated with increased fitness in the hospital environment.
The latter report also identified eight genes as potential
markers for the V583/MMH594-lineage [16]. V583 and
MMH594 both display ST6 [17], and five of the eight
genes (EF2250, EF2253, EF2254, EF3155 and EF3252)
were also present in the ST6-isolates (158B and
LMGT3303; results not shown) analyzed by CGH in our
study.
Comparative genome analyses have revealed that pathogen evolution often progresses through gene acquisition
via HGT [32]. The 169 genes that were characterized as
divergent in all the community-derived baby isolates by
CGH may be potential pathogen-specific genes in E. faecalis, or genes that are specific to V583. However, additional CGH data from both pathogenic and nonpathogenic isolates are needed to address this issue. Vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis (VREfs) isolates appear to be
widely spread in hospital environments, while isolation
of VREfs from healthy volunteers rarely occurs [41-44].
Accordingly, the vanB operon was divergent in all the isolates studied by CGH in our lab (altogether 21 strains;[18]
and results not shown). In addition to gene acquisition,
pathoadaptive mutations via gene loss also plays an
important role in evolution of bacteria [45]. A disadvantage of the comparative genomic analyses presented here,
is that the comparison of gene content is based on a single
reference strain (V583), only. The E. faecalis OG1RF
genome showed that, in addition to a shared core of 2474

Page 9 of 11

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/194

ORFs [29], both the V583 and the OG1RF genome carry
unique genes, suggesting that the E. faecalis pan-genome
will be further extended as more strains will be sequenced.
The availability of additional E. faecalis genome sequences
and the construction of a pan-species array would further
increase the sensitivity of such approaches.

Conclusion

Additional File 4

The data presented here suggest that the genetic variation
among the investigated commensal E. faecalis is comparable to the genetic variation previously detected in a strain
set thought to be representative of the major E. faecalis lineages. The widespread distribution of putative virulence
determinants in the fecal baby isolates in this study supports the conception of enterococcal virulence, not as a
result of any single virulence factor, but as a more complex
process. Population structure studies of E. faecalis by
MLST have identified so-called high-risk enterococcal
clonal complexes (HiRECCs), defined as distinct genetic
complexes that predominate among nosocomial infections. The failure to identify a shared set of pathogen-specific genes in E. faecalis so far opens up the possibility that
the fitness and virulence of different HIRECCs may be due
to genes that are unique within a lineage, but that the
combined effects of the different gene-sets result in the
same phenotype, i.e. infection. The observed correlation
between CGH and MLST presented here, may offer a
method for the identification of lineage-specific genes,
and may therefore add clues on how to distinguish pathogenic from commensal E. faecalis.
