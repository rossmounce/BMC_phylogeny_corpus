Characterization of an H10N8 influenza virus
isolated from Dongting lake wetland

Abstract
Background: Wild birds, especially those in wetlands and aquatic environments, are considered to be natural
reservoirs of avian influenza viruses. It is accepted that water is an important component in the transmission cycle
of avian influenza virus. Monitoring the water at aggregation and breeding sites of migratory waterfowl, mainly
wetland, is very important for early detection of avian influenza virus. The epidemiology investigation of avian
influenza virus was performed in Dongting lake wetland which is an international important wetland.
Results: An H10N8 influenza virus was isolated from Dongting Lake wetland in 2007. Phylogenetic analysis
indicated that the virus was generated by multiple gene segment reassortment. The isolate was lowly pathogenic
for chickens. However, it replicated efficiently in the mouse lung without prior adaptation, and the virulence to
mice increased rapidly during adaptation in mouse lung. Sequence analysis of the genome of viruses from
different passages showed that multiple amino acid changes were involved in the adaptation of the isolates to
mice.
Conclusions: The water might be an important component in the transmission cycle of avian influenza virus, and
other subtypes of avian influenza viruses (other than H5, H7 and H9) might evolve to pose a potential threat to
mammals and even humans.

Background
All 16 hemagglutinin (HA) and 9 neuraminidase (NA)
subtypes of influenza A virus have been isolated from
wild birds [1,2]. Therefore, wild birds, especially those in
wetlands and aquatic environments, are considered to
be natural reservoirs of avian influenza viruses[2]. It is
accepted that water is an important component in the
transmission cycle of avian influenza virus, because
shedding of virus into the water leads to transmission
among wild birds and poultry via the indirect fecal-oral
route [2,3].
Dongting Lake wetland is an important habitat and
over-wintering area for East Asian migratory birds, and is
located at 28°30’-30°20’ N and 111°40’-113°40’ E in the
Northeastern part of Hunan Province, China. In 2007, an
influenza virus A/environment/Dongting Lake/Hunan/
3-9/07 (H10N8) was isolated from water from Dongting
Lake wetland. The whole genome of the isolated virus

was sequenced, the phylogenetic trees of each gene segment were generated, and the pathogenicity of the strain
for mice and SPF White Leghorn Chickens was studied.
To study further its potential pathogenicity for mammals,
the virus was passaged in mouse lung, and the pathogenicity and corresponding amino acid variations of the
mouse-lung-adapted virus from passages 2, 4 and 6
(P2, P4 and P6) were compared with those of wild-type
virus (P0).

Results
Virus isolation and sequence comparisons

An H10N8 influenza A virus was isolated from water
samples from Dongting Lake wetland, and named as
A/environment/Dongting Lake/Hunan/3-9/2007 (H10N8)
(environment/DT/Hunan/3-9/07). The whole genome of
the isolated virus was sequenced to understand the genetic
character of the virus.
BLAST analysis of the eight gene segments of environment/DT/Hunan/3-9/07 revealed the presence of an HA
gene that was closely related to that of A/duck/Mongolia/
149/03 (H10N5), with a nucleotide sequence identity of

96% and amino acid sequence identity of 97% (Table 1).
The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the NA gene
of the H10N8 strain showed 97% and 98% homology,
respectively, with those of strain A/duck/Spain/539/2006
(H6N8) (Table 1). The basic polymerase gene (PB2) was
common to both A/mallard/Italy/37/02 (H5N3) and
A/mallard/250/02 (H7N1), with a nucleotide sequence
identity of 97%. However, the amino acid sequence of PB2
was closely related to that of A/mallard/Italy/3401/05
(H5N1) and A/mallard/Netherlands/12/00 (H7N3), with
99% identity (Table 1). The nucleotide sequence of the
PB1 gene of the H10N8 strain showed 98% homology with
that of the low-pathogenicity influenza virus strain
A/duck/Denmark/65047/04(H5N2) isolated in Denmark
in 2004, and the amino acid sequence showed 99% homology with that of A/turkey/Italy/1325/2005 (H5N2) and
A/mallard/Netherlands/12/2000 (H7N3) (Table 1). The
nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the PA gene of
the H10N8 strain showed 97% and 99% homology, respectively, with those of the strain A/mallard/Italy/3401/2005
(H5N1) (Table 1). The nucleotide sequence of the NP
gene of the H10N8 strain showed 98% homology with that
of strain A/migratory duck/Jiang Xi/13487/2005 (H5N3),
whereas the amino acid sequence showed 99% homology
to that of strains A/Tree sparrow/Henan/4/2004 (H5N1)
and A/duck/Jiang Xi/2374/2005 (H3N6) (Table 1). The
matrix gene (M) of the H10N8 strain had 98% nucleotide
sequence identity with A/duck/Hokkaido/Vac-2/04
(H7N7) and A/duck/Hokkaido/Vac-1/04 (H5N1). The

amino acid sequence of the M1 gene had 100% identity
with A/duck/Korea/S9/03 (H3N2) (Table 1). The nucleotide sequence of the non-structural gene (NS) of the
H10N8 strain was most closely related to that of A/mallard/Yanchen/05 (H4N6) and A/duck/Jiangxi/1760/03
(H7N7), with 98% identity. The amino acid sequence of
the NS1 gene of the H10N8 strain showed 98% identity
with that of strains A/duck/Shantou/7488/2004 (H9N2)
and A/mallard/Ohio/217/1998 (H6N8) (Table 1).
Phylogenic analysis

Phylogenic analysis indicated that all the 8 gene segments
of environment/DT/Hunan/3-9/07 were of aquatic avian
origin and belonged to a Eurasian lineage. Phylogenic
analysis of the HA gene revealed that it was closely
related to Eurasian aquatic isolates (Figure 1a). The N8
NA genes of influenza A viruses were divided into
3 groups, namely, equine lineage, avian viruses isolated in
the Eurasian region, and avian viruses isolated in North
America [4]. The NA gene of environment/DT/Hunan/
3-9/07 belonged to the lineage of avian viruses isolated in
the Eurasian region (Figure 1b). The PB2 and PA genes
of the H10N8 strain clustered together with the corresponding genes from H5 and H7 subtypes isolated from
ducks and mallards in the Eurasian region (Figure 1c and
1e). However, the PB1 gene of the H10N8 strain formed
a branch on the phylogenic tree together with those from
H7 avian influenza viruses isolated from ducks, turkeys,
and humans in some European countries, which

NP gene of the isolated strain formed a relatively independent branch on the phylogenic tree, together with
those from H5N3 and H10N5 viruses of Eurasian lineage
(Figure 1f). M and NS genes of the isolated strain
belonged to the Eurasian lineage too (Figure 1g and 1h).
Chicken study

To determine the pathogenicity of environment/DT/
Hunan/3-9/07, 8 SPF chickens were inoculated intravenously with virus in a volume of 0.2 ml (10 6.3 EID 50 ),
and another 8 chickens were inoculated intranasally
with virus in a volume of 0.1 ml (10 6.0 EID 50 ), and
observed for clinical signs of disease and mortality for
14 days. The oropharyngeal and cloacal swabs of chickens were collected on days 3, 5 and 7 post inoculation
(p.i.). for virus titration. None of the chickens challenged
by intravenous or intranasal virus showed any clinical
signs of disease within 14 days p.i., and none died during the observation period. These results suggested that
the H10N8 strain was a low or non-pathogenic virus.
Sera were harvested from the chickens at 21 days p.i.
and seroconversion was confirmed by hemagglutination
inhibition (HI) test. All the inoculated birds were seroconverted, although the HI antibody titers remained low
throughout the experimental period (Table 2).

Mouse study

Wild-type environment/DT/Hunan/3-9/07 showed no
obvious pathogenicity towards BALB/c mice, and no
obvious body weight loss was observed in inoculated
mice (Figure 2), but high virus titers were detected in
the lungs of mice on days 3 and 5 p.i. (Table 3). However, replication of wild-type virus was restricted in the
lungs of mice, and no virus was recovered from other
organs.
To evaluate further the potential pathogenicity of the
H10N8 strain for mammals, the virus was subjected to
lung-to-lung passage in mice. The virulence of environment/DT/Hunan/3-9/07 increased rapidly during adaptation in mouse lung. The result showed that, after two
lung passages (P2), the virus caused fatal infection in
mice. Mice inoculated with P2 virus showed serious
clinical signs of disease such as ruffled fur, less movement and body weight loss (Figure 2), and viruses were
recovered from multiple organs including the brain on
days 3 and 5 p.i. (Table 3). Death of mice inoculated
with P2 virus occurred on day 7 p.i., and all the 6 inoculated mice died within 11 days p.i. After 4-6 lung-tolung passages, the virulence of the virus was enhanced
further. The mice inoculated with P4 or P6 virus had
the similar clinical signs of disease to those infected
with P2 virus, but the mice inoculated with P4/P6 virus

demonstrated more rapid and serious symptom onset
compared with P2-infected mice (Table 3). The mice
inoculated with P4 virus all died within 5 days p.i.,
whereas those inoculated with P6 virus all died within
4 days p.i. (Figure 2).
Molecular changes during virus adaptation in mouse lung

To study further the molecular changes involved in the
enhanced virulence of mouse-adapted virus, the whole
genomes of P2, P4 and P6 viruses were sequenced, and
their amino acid sequences were compared with those
of wild-type virus strain (P0).

Figure 2 Changes in body weight of BALB/c mice infected with
different passages of the H10N8 virus. Each mouse in a group
was intranasally infected with 105.5EID50 of the virus from different
passage (P0, P2, P4 or P6) in a volume of 50 μl. The mice inoculated
with lung washes prepared from uninfected mice served as a
background control. The body weight of each mouse was
expressed as the percentage of its weight on the day after
infection. All the P2-infected mice died within 11 days after
infection, whereas P4- and P6-infected mice died within 5 days.

It was found that, during passage in the mouse lung
from P0 to P6, 22 amino acid substitutions appeared,
i.e. sites 207, 616 and 627 of PB2 gene; sites 247 and
611 of PA gene; sites 94, 244, 252, 386 and 430 of HA
gene; site 479 of NP gene; sites 21, 32, 286, 330 and 385
of NA gene; sites 53 and 192 of M1 gene; site 82 of M2
gene; and sites 54, 89 and 155 of NS1 gene (Table 4).
No amino acid substitutions were observed in PB1 or
NS2 genes during passage in murine lung from P0 to P6
(Table 4).

Discussion
Among all 16 HA and 9 NA subtypes of influenza A
viruses, the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses are
restricted to subtypes H5 and H7, although not all H5
and H7 viruses are virulent. However, low-pathogenicity
viruses previously have been shown to be precursors of
highly pathogenic viruses [5,6]. The H10N8 strain isolated in the present study replicated efficiently in mouse
lung without prior adaptation. Its pathogenicity for mice
increased rapidly during lung adaptation, and even after
2 passages, it became lethal for mice. It has been
reported that H11N9 subtype virus can be transmitted
directly from wild ducks to waterfowl hunters [7].
Therefore, when emphasis is placed on H5, H7 and H9
subtype avian influenza viruses, the other subtypes
should not be ignored, because they might also be a
potential threat to public health.
Migratory birds that carry avian influenza virus might
shed virus into the environment along their migratory
route. After the birds leave an area, environmental persistence of the virus could play an important ecological
role in virus transmission [8,9]. Shedding of the virus
into water could lead to infection of any waterfowl that
are dabbling in the same area, via the direct or indirect
fecal-oral route[2]. Animals that utilize an area in which

The whole genome of the viruses from P0, P2, P4, P6 were sequenced, and
the amino acid sequences of the corresponding gene segments was aligned.
-, No amino acid substitution was found.

Phylogenic analysis showed that all the gene segments
of environment/DT/Hunan/3-9/07 belonged to the Eurasian lineage, but some gene segment of the virus had
different origin. It is believed that all 16 subtypes of HA
and 9 subtypes of NA are perpetuated in the aquatic
bird population, and reassorted with each other with a
high frequency [1,2]. It is assumed that, when viruses of
different origin are mixed somewhere in the habitats or
aggregation sites along the migration route, gene reassortment takes place [10]. The virus strain isolated in
the present study could have been resulted from multiple gene segments reassortment between different
viruses, including H5 and H7 subtypes.
The virus strain isolated in this study replicated effectively in mouse lung without prior adaptation. During
adaptation, the virus demonstrated extrapulmonary
spread and enhanced replication in the mouse, and the
viruses were recovered from multiple organs, including
the brain. The virulence of the strain in mice increased
rapidly and became lethal after only 2 lung-to-lung passages. The host specificity and pathogenicity of influenza
A virus have always been considered as being determined by multiple genes [11,12]. However, the genetic
basis for virulence of influenza A virus is largely
unknown [13]. During 6 passages of the H10N8 strain
in mouse lung, amino acid substitutions were observed
at 22 sites in the viral genome (Table 4). These demonstrated that multiple amino acid substitutions were
likely to have been involved in the adaptation of the
virus to mice. It has been reported that the amino acid
substitution from E to K at site 627 of the PB2 gene is
the first step in virus adaptation in mammals, and that
this substitution is host-dependent [14,15]. Therefore,
we deduced that the PB2-E627K substitution significantly enhanced the pathogenicity of the H10N8 strain

Zhang et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:42
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/42

for mice. However, after 2 lung-to-lung passages, viral
pathogenicity was also enhanced and caused death,
compared with the wild-type virus, but there was no
amino acid substitution at the 627 site in the PB2 gene
of P2 virus, which indicated that the amino acid substitutions at other sites in the viral genome were also
involved in the increased virulence of mouse-lungadapted virus strains. It has also been shown that molecular changes at specific sites of PA and PB1 genes are
associated with high pathogenicity of the H5N1 virus
[16]. However, no amino acid substitution was observed
in PB1 gene during virus adaptation, whereas the amino
acids 247 and 611 of PA were substituted. The amino
acid at site 479 of the NP gene of the virus strain isolated in the present study was substituted from L to F
during passage in murine lung, which might influence
NP oligomerization [13,17]. The activity-enhancing
mutations of the viral polymerase complex that consists
of PB2, PB1, PA and NP might be a prerequisite for
adaptation to a new host [17,18].
The amino acids at 5 sites of the HA gene were substituted during passage of the virus in mouse lung. In the
H5N1 subtype viruses, the multiple basic acids adjacent
to the cleavage site of the HA gene are a prerequisite for
lethality in mice and chickens [19]. The pathogenicity of
the H10N8 virus isolated in this study increased rapidly
during passage in mouse lung, although no amino acid
substitutions were observed near the cleavage sites of its
HA gene. The balance between neuraminidase activity of
the NA gene and receptor-binding activity of the HA
gene is closely associated with replication of influenza
virus in the host [20]. Studies have shown that M1 gene
mutation during passage in mouse lung might enhance
virus replication, which results in enhanced pathogenicity
[21]. The amino acid substitutions at sites 53 and 192 of
the M1 gene might have close relationship with viral
pathogenicity. NS1 protein plays an important role in
counteracting the host interferon system [22], and is closely related to viral pathogenicity and host specificity
[23,24]. In the present study, the amino acids at sites 54,
89 and 155 of the NS1 gene were substituted. It should
be noticed that the substitution from Y to H at site 89
might be closely related to pathogenicity and adaptation
of influenza A virus, because the same mutation has been
observed at the same site during H9N2 virus adaptation
in mouse lung [12]. Amino acid substitutions were
observed at multiple sites of the genomes of the H10N8
strain during adaptation in mouse lung. Comparison of
the genomic amino acid sequence of P0, P2, P4 and P6
viruses are helpful in understanding the molecular
mechanism of pathogenicity of influenza A virus.
When the virus was passaged in the mouse lung from
P0 to P6, 22 amino acid substitutions appeared. Some of

Page 6 of 9

these substitutions might be introduced randomly and
maintained, whereas others are selected during adaptation of the virus in mice. Some substitutions such as the
PB2-E627K, NP-L479F and NS1-Y89H have been found
during the other influenza virus adaptation in mouse
lung [12,13,17]. However, whether these amino acid substitutions lead to increased virus virulence in chickens
remains unknown. The wild-type H10N8 strain showed
no significant pathogenicity towards SPF chickens, but
the infected chickens had shed virus through the respiratory tract and cloaca. The H10N8 virus isolated in present study possesses internal genes of both H5 and H7
subtype origin, which might provide gene segments for
further gene reassortment between various influenza A
viruses. It is assumed that the wider the circulation of
low-pathogenicity avian influenza virus in poultry, the
higher the chance that mutation to high-pathogenicity
virus will occur [6]. Low-pathogenicity viruses previously
have been shown to be the precursors of high-pathogenicity viruses [5,6].If such a virus is allowed to circulate in
poultry or wild birds, mutations may merge, and the lowpathogenicity virus could become more pathogenic by
gene mutation or reassortment.
Influenza A viruses have been maintained in waterfowl
populations by water-borne transmission [25]. Shedding
of the virus into the water is a major threat for epidemics in poultry [2]. Therefore, water persistence of
viruses might play an important ecological role in virus
transmission. Monitoring the water at aggregation and
breeding sites of migratory waterfowl, mainly wetland, is
very important for early detection of avian influenza
virus [3]. Dongting Lake wetland is an important habitat
and overwintering area along the migration route of
migratory birds in East Asia. In the wetland, domestic
ducks often share with wild waterfowl the same water
area for dabbling and habitat, which provides ample
opportunity for influenza virus to infect domestic ducks
and other domestic poultry. Thus, investigation of water
in Donting Lake wetland for avian influenza virus is of
greater significance and convenience for understanding
the route and mechanism of virus transmission between
domestic fowl and migratory birds.

Conclusions
In the wetland, water persistence of viruses might play
an important ecological role in virus transmission. The
avian influenza viruses might be transmitted among wild
and domestic waterfowls through waterway. It should be
noted that the H10N8 subtypes of avian influenza
viruses might evolve to pose a potential threat to mammals and multiple amino acid substitutions are likely to
be involved in the adaptation of H10N8 influenza virus
to mice.

Materials and methods

Genetic and phylogenic analysis

Ethics Statement

Total RNA from the virus genome was extracted from
the prepared virus stock by lysing with Trizol LS reagent
(Life Technologies) and reverse-transcribed into singlestranded DNA with M-MuLV reverse transcriptase
(New England Biolabs). All segments were amplified
with Phusion™ High-Fidelity PCR Kit (New England
Biolabs). The PCR products were purified with the
Cycle-pure Kit and Gel Extraction Kit (OMEGA), and
the fragments were cloned into pGEM-T easy vector
and sequenced by the dideoxy method with an ABI
3730 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Three
clones of each gene were selected for repeated sequencing to confirm that the sequence data obtained on the
two occasions were identical[29]. Data were edited and
aligned by BioEdit version 7.0.5.2.
Phylogenic trees were generated with neighbor-joining
bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates) using the TamuraNei algorithm in MEGA version 3.1 [30].

Specific-pathogen-free (SPF) BALB/c mice (females,
aged 6-8 weeks old) were purchased from Hubei
Research Center of Laboratory Animal, China. The SPF
white Leghorn chickens (aged 6 weeks old) were purchased from Beijing Merial Vital Laboratory Animal
Technology CO., LTD. Mice and Chickens were all bred
in the Animal Resource Center at the Wuhan Institute
of Virology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, maintained
in specific-pathogen-free conditions prior to infection,
and cared for under MOST (Ministry of Science and
Technology of the People’s Republic of China) guidelines for laboratory animals. All experiments involved in
animals have been approved by Animal Care Committee
of Wuhan Institute of Virology, Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
Sample collection

In October 2007, 95 water samples from areas near the
habitat of migratory birds in East Dongting Lake,
Yueyang City, Hunan Province were collected by using
sterilized 200-ml screw-cap plastic vials. A 200-ml water
sample was collected at each sampling site, stored in a
portable refrigerator, sent to our laboratory, and stored
at -80°C until assayed.
Virus isolation and purification

Seventy milliliters of each water sample was transferred
into a sterilized 80-ml polyethylene plastic tube with a
screw-cap and round bottom, under aseptic conditions.
Polyethylene glycol 6000, sodium chloride and bovine
serum albumin (BSA) were added to final concentrations of 8%, 3% and 0.1%, respectively, mixed gently, set
on ice for 8-12 h during which the tube was inverted
every 2 h to mix the contents, and centrifuged at 4°C,
10,000×g for 30 min[26]. The supernatant was discarded, and the precipitate was re-suspended in 1 ml
PBS, which contained 2 × 106 U/l penicillin, 2 × 106 U/l
amphotericin B, 250 mg/l kitasamycin, 0.5 × 10 6 U/l
nystatin, and 60 mg/l ofloxacin HCl. Then, 0.5 ml of the
re-suspended mixture was inoculated into the allantoic
cavities of 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free (SPF)
embryonated chicken eggs and incubated at 37°C for
72 h. The allantoic fluid with hemagglutination titers
were harvested and confirmed as influenza A virus stock
by RT-PCR, using NP-gene-specific primers and universal primers for the M gene of influenza A virus, as
described previously[27,28]. The confirmed influenza
virus stock was aliquoted and stored at -80°C before use.
The viruses were clonally purified by plaque isolation
in MDCK monolayers, followed by stock preparation as
described previously [11,13].

Chicken study

Eight SPF White Leghorn Chickens aged 6 weeks were
intravenously inoculated with 0.2 ml of a 1:10 dilution
of bacteria-free allantoic fluid that contained virus (106.3
EID 50 ). Meanwhile, another 8 chickens aged 6 weeks
were inoculated intranasally with 0.1 ml 10 6.0 EID 50
virus. The inoculated chickens were observed for 14
days for mortality and clinical signs of disease. Tracheal
and cloacal swabs were collected on days 3, 5 and 7
post inoculation (p.i.) for virus titration [31]. The EID50
was calculated by the Reed and Muench method. Sera
were harvested from the inoculated chickens on day 21
p.i. for seroconversion confirmation by hemagglutination
inhibition (HI) assays with 0.5% chicken erythrocytes
according to the recommendation of OIE.
Adaptation of the H10N8 strain in the mouse lung

Adaptation of the H10N8 strain in mouse lung was carried out by serial lung-to-lung passage, as described previously [11,32]. Ten female BALB/c mice aged 6 weeks
were anesthetized and inoculated intranasally with 106.5
EID50 purified virus in a volume of 50 μl, and labeled as
P0. The mice were sacrificed on day 3 p.i., and their
lungs and trachea were taken out and washed 3 times
with a total of 2 ml PBS that contained 0.1% BSA and
antibiotics, as described previously [33]. The lung washes
were centrifuged at 4°C, 4,000×g for 10 min, and the
supernatant was harvested, aliquoted, and stored at
-80°C, and labeled as P1[34]. The lung-to-lung passage
tests were repeated 6 times, and labeled up to P6.
The BALB/c mice aged 6 weeks were divided into 4
groups of 16 each, anesthetized, and inoculated intranasally with P0 (wild-type), P2, P4 and P6 virus in a

Zhang et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:42

volume of 50 μl (105.5 EID50). Five mice in each group
were dissected on days 3 and 5 p.i., and their lungs,
spleens, kidneys and brains were taken out under aseptic
conditions, weighed and homogenized with 1 ml PBS
that had been pre-cooled in ice. Tissue homogenates
were centrifuged at 4°C,4,000×g for 10 min to remove
any tissue fragments, and used to determine virus titer
[31]. The remaining 6 mice in each group were observed
daily for weight loss and mortality. The 50% mouse
lethal dose (MLD 50 ) of the virus was determined by
inoculating intranasally 5 groups of mice (n = 5 mice
each) with 10-fold serial dilutions of the virus in a
volume of 50 μl. The MLD 50 was calculated by the
method of Reed and Muench.
