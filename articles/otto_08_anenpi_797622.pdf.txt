Abstract
Background: Enzymes are responsible for the catalysis of the biochemical reactions in metabolic
pathways. Analogous enzymes are able to catalyze the same reactions, but they present no
significant sequence similarity at the primary level, and possibly different tertiary structures as well.
They are thought to have arisen as the result of independent evolutionary events. A detailed study
of analogous enzymes may reveal new catalytic mechanisms, add information about the origin and
evolution of biochemical pathways and disclose potential targets for drug development.
Results: In this work, we have constructed and implemented a new approach, AnEnPi (the
Analogous Enzyme Pipeline), using a combination of bioinformatics tools like BLAST, HMMer, and
in-house scripts, to assist in the identification, annotation, comparison and study of analogous and
homologous enzymes. The algorithm for the detection of analogy is based i) on the construction
of groups of homologous enzymes and ii) on the identification of cases where a given enzymatic
activity is performed by two or more proteins without significant similarity between their primary
structures. We applied this approach to a dataset obtained from KEGG Comprising all annotated
enzymes, which resulted in the identification of 986 EC classes where putative analogy was
detected (40.5% of all EC classes). AnEnPi is of considerable value in the construction of initial
datasets that can be further curated, particularly in gene and genome annotation, in studies
involving molecular evolution and metabolism and in the identification of new potential drug
targets.
Conclusion: AnEnPi is an efficient tool for detection and annotation of analogous enzymes and
other enzymes in whole genomes. It is available for academic use at: http://bioinfo.pdtis.fiocruz.br/
AnEnPi/

Background
Enzymes catalyze biochemical reactions and are classified
according to the recommendations of the Nomenclature
Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry
[1]. Each enzymatic activity has a recommended name

and an Enzyme Commission (EC) number assigned,
depending on the reaction that it catalyzes [2]. For a better
understanding of the metabolism of a given species it is of
utmost importance to locate, identify and annotate the
genes encoding such enzymatic activities. Most

approaches to perform these tasks are based on sequence
similarity searches, using computational tools like BLAST
[3] or Hidden Markov Models (HMMer [4]) and curated
databases.
However, comparisons between computational reconstructions of metabolic pathways from different organisms revealed the existence of gaps [5]. An organism can
truly lack a part of a pathway, use an alternative one, or
the function is present but unannotated for different reasons (for instance, genome assembly problems). Another
explanation is that some of these apparent gaps might
involve alternative enzymes, also known as functional
analogs [6]. Such enzymes are generally believed to be the
result of independent evolutionary events [7]. Some properties of analogous enzymes include its association with
different phylogenetic origins, possession of distinct catalytic mechanisms and also different foldings [8]. Automated annotation approaches, normally used for
preliminary gene identification and characterization, usually employ methods based on sequence similarity criteria. These may not be able to detect analogs, as these
enzymes exhibit virtually no significant sequence similarity between their primary structures [9]. In some cases it is
possible to use other types of data, such as the genomic
context or the experimental detection of a particular enzymatic activity, to identify the genes coding for the missing
activities [10].
However, most often such genes are not characterized as
analogous in the accompanying annotation, for Example
in public databases such as KEGG [11].
Previous work performed by other groups suggest that the
fraction of enzymatic activities where multiple events of
independent origin have occurred may be substantial, in
the order of 25% [9]. However, to our knowledge a global
survey of these events, which also has the potential to
shed light on the evolution of biochemical pathways and
genome organization, has not been done.
Analogous enzymes may also constitute a huge and
largely untapped resource for the identification of drug
targets. Strategies to find candidate genes as potential targets for drug development usually focus on parasite-specific genes and even complete biochemical pathways [12],
or for structural differences between homologues. Unfortunately, due to technical limitations, the number of
available 3D structures represents only a fraction of all
proteins identified so far, limiting direct structural comparisons and inducing researchers to rely on the comparison of annotation data. Since analogous enzymes, which
may have Substantially different foldings – a desired prerequisite for drug development – are not annotated as

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/544

such, they may be overlooked as possible candidates for
drug development.
To help in the process of identification and annotation of
analogous enzymes, we implemented a web based Tool
named AnEnPi. It analyses and compares genomic datasets for analogous enzymes, by clustering the primary
structures of enzymes with the same described activity and
using a Blastp similarity raw score of 120 as cut-off [7].
This resulted in a list of clusters that reflect substantial
structural differences between enzymes with the same
activity but with possibly different evolutionary origins.

Methods
AnEnPi was programmed in Perl using the CGI-interface.
All clusters as well as their HMMer-models are available
for download on the web page.
An overview of AnEnPi is shown in Figure 1. For clustering
we used the similarity score with a cut-off Value 120 of
BLASTp pair wise comparisons between all proteins
included in a specified dataset, based on the experimental
work of Galperin [7]. In the work described here, groups
are composed of proteins sharing the same enzymatic
activity (EC classes). Within a group, protein sequences
are clustered. Enzymes within a given cluster are considered homologous, while enzymes in different clusters (of
the same group/function) are considered analogous.
These clusters are stored in a flat file database, which can
be used to annotate or re-annotate a set of proteins. To
improve visualization, metabolic maps can be generated
automatically.
Dataset
We have applied AnEnPi to cluster a dataset composed of
311 reference metabolic pathways and 1,871,732 protein
sequences of 36 eukaryotes, 398 eubacteria and 31 archaeabacteria obtained from the KEGG database [11,13]. In
total, 326,013 sequences had a corresponding EC number
assigned describing their enzymatic activity, belonging to
2,433 different EC classes. This result forms the main
dataset of clusters used by AnEnPi.
Clustering
The clustering algorithm was implemented similarly to
the method proposed by Galperin [7]. First, sequences
with less than 100 amino acids were excluded from the
dataset. For each enzymatic activity, an all-against-all
BLASTp [3] (using a maximum e-value of 0.01 and standard parameters) was executed and results were transformed in a graph where each node represents an enzyme
[14]. Two nodes are connected by an unweighted and
undirected edge if they belong to the same EC class and
have a similarity score higher or equal to 120 (an e-value
close to e-6) [7]. This parameter (and others) can be mod-

clusters. Light gray rectangles are the modular functions of
AnEnPi, described in the text.

Secondly, all enzymatic activities not defined up to the
fourth level of the EC classification were also excluded
(dataset C). Thirdly, all clusters of a determined function
with proteins annotated as subunits of this function and
Belonging to the same species were joined (dataset D).
Finally, all clusters displaying putative intragenomic analogy (here defined as the identification of analogy between
two enzymes in the same genome) were also joined (dataset E).
Metabolic map reconstruction
Each result can be visualized as a metabolic map by using
an external resource (a KEGG tool – [16]). Further, EC
classes with potential cases of analogy or without representative sequences are highlighted. Color codes are used
to discriminate the significance of the results, as well as
the presence of analogy.
Detection of analogy
In this work, we define a potential case of analogy if the
sequences from a given enzymatic activity present in the
genome of a single organism or between two organisms
are placed in different clusters after grouping (intragenomic and inter-genomic analogy, respectively).
Orthologs or recently duplicated paralogs would be
placed in the same cluster. Therefore AnEnPi compares,
within a single species or between two species, the presence of a given function in each cluster, for all species currently represented in KEGG database. In the metabolic
reconstruction step, the presence of a given enzymatic
activity in a genome, the presence of analogy and the
degree of significance of similarity searches can be highlighted. The result is an interactive list (in HTML or text
format) with links to the EC classes and the metabolic
maps.

ified by the user. All sequences connected in the graph
were assigned to the same cluster and are considered
homologous. Sequences not connected by a path in the
graph are considered analogous. Therefore, the number of
disconnected sub graphs would, in principle, represent
the number of times that the enzymatic activity in question is thought to have appeared during evolution within
the current dataset. As a representation of the graph, an
adjacency-matrix [15] was implemented (Figure 2). Each
cluster is finally stored in a flat file database.

Annotation
For the purpose of annotation and identification, the user
can perform similarity searches either by BLASTp or
HMMSearch. In the first case, the database is composed of
all proteins present in the clusters; in the second case, the
database is composed of the probabilistic models constructed for each cluster, if the cluster has more than one
element. For the construction of the latter, a multiple
alignment was executed with ClustalW [17] and then
transformed into a HMMer model with the functionalities
available in the HMMer package. This type of annotation
is based on the quality of previously annotated databases.

Filters for the datasets
Dataset a, the less conservative, is composed by all clusters
formed after the initial clustering step. This dataset was
further refined, using more stringent criteria. Filters were
applied in four successive steps: Firstly, all clusters with
only one sequence (singlets) were excluded (dataset B).

Therefore, we have introduced filters allowing the construction of different datasets, minimizing the number of
wrongly identified cases of analogy and wrongly attributed functions. To our knowledge, AnEnPi is the only tool
that provides annotation functionalities with emphasis
on analogous enzymes.

represents the blastp similarity score of two enzymes. All scores above 1500 are reset to 1500. Higher similarity scores yield
darker points, (white represents a score below 120). Sequences were sorted by the similarity score, using the longest enzymes
as reference to the other enzymes. The three arrows on the right site indicate the positions of enzymes of L. major (red
arrows) and H. sapiens (blue arrow). Histograms on the left display the distribution of organisms represented in each cluster,
for the three kingdoms: archaebacteria (A), bacteria (B) and eukaryotes (E). In each of the two main (analogous) clusters, subclusters can be observed. The graph at the top of the matrix displays the kingdom of the organism for every enzyme in the
matrix.
Front-end
All components described so far (Figure 1) were included
in a user-friendly web-based interface named AnEnPi. All
main functionalities are independent processes and may
be used in different contexts, for instance in the identification of analogous enzymes, in sequence annotation, clustering or metabolic reconstruction. Also, sequences
entered by the user can be clustered and converted into an
annotation database for similarity searches. Results are
displayed in a web page.

Results
We implemented a web based interface http://bio
info.pdtis.fiocruz.br/AnEnPi/ called AnEnPi (Analogous
Enzyme Pipeline) that can be used for the annotation and
visualization of metabolic pathways, and for the detection
of events of analogy. As an example, we applied AnEnPi to
identify possible cases of analogy between enzymes
present in the genome of L. major [18] and the human
genome, using a clusters From the KEGG database to form
our reference datasets.

Work flow, user interface, sequences and organisms
Clustering of the dataset obtained from KEGG produced
6,701 clusters, with 986 enzymatic activities (from the
2,433 represented in the KEGG dataset) having more than
one cluster (approximately 40.5%) (Table 1). 2,199
sequences formed singlets, while 328 EC classes had more
than three clusters. Table 1 shows the number of enzymatic activities with putative analogy before and after the
four steps of data filtering. After the third filtering step
(dataset D), the number of functions with more than 5
clusters drops to 46. Still, even after the application of
these 3 filters, 19% of the enzymatic activities contain
putative analogous sequences.
Comparison with literature data
To validate our results, we have searched the literature for
known cases of analogy, predicted or confirmed through
diverse approaches, such as computational and/or experimental methods. We compared our results with those of
[7], where 108 cases of analogy were described. Only for
three enzymatic activities the number of clusters produced

by AnEnPi was smaller, in each case due to dataset differences. For all other cases we found at least the same
number of clusters, demonstrating the consistency of the
results. Table 2 illustrates some cases of analogy found in
the literature. All functions listed also display potential
cases of analogous sequences in our results, provided that
the enzymatic activity in question is included in KEGG.
Adjacency matrices and kingdom line
Figure 2 shows an adjacency-matrix for EC 4.2.1.2.(fumarate hydratase), a representation of an all-against-all
BLASTp of all proteins belonging to this enzymatic activity. Each point in the matrix indicates the similarity score
between two enzymes. Two main clusters can be seen,
where sequences from one cluster have no detectable similarity with sequences from the other cluster. Some subclusters can be seen inside each main cluster, representing
groups of more similar sequences, particularly inside cluster 1.

The histograms on the left and the 'kingdom line' above
the matrix show the distribution of the organisms represented in the matrix in terms of kingdoms. Sub-cluster 1.1
has sequences derived from eukaryotes and eubacteria,
while sub-clusters 1.2 and 1.3 from eubacteria only. The
remaining sequences of cluster 1 do not form a welldefined sub-cluster, but archaeabacterial sequences are
present only in this structure.
However, further identification of subclusters will be studied in another work, as a refinement of the present methodology. As an example of a potential case of analogy, for
this EC function the location of the corresponding
enzymes of L. major (two genes) and H. sapiens are displayed.
Analogy identification
When applying AnEnPi to find analogy between H. sapiens
and L. major, thirty-five potential cases of analogy were
found using dataset D (Table 1). In twelve cases (EC
1.1.1.2, EC 1.3.1.34, EC 1.3.3.4, EC 2.3.1.48, EC 2.7.1.2,
EC 2.7.4.2, EC 3.5.1.14, EC 3.6.1.23, EC 4.2.1.1, EC
4.2.1.2 (Figure 2), EC 5.3.1.6 and EC 5.3.3.2), intergenomic analogy was found. The smallest cluster found
comprised 8 individual protein sequences. The great
majority (80 well as intra-genomic analogy. For example,
in EC 2.1.1.17 (phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase), enzymes of L. major and H. sapiens share the
cluster #4, but enzymes of L. major were also found in
cluster #3. Therefore, L. major enzymes from cluster #3 are
analogous to H. sapiens sequences present in cluster #4,
and the sequences from both organisms present in cluster
#4 are homologous. This function can also be used to display any other differences between two species in the web
frontend (Figure 3).
Intragenomic analogy
As described above, EC 2.1.1.17 is also a case of intragenomic analogy in L. major. With AnEnPi we detected a total

of 12 cases of intragenomic analogy in L. major using dataset D. Application of AnEnPi to Datasets A, B and C
returned 34, 34 and 23 cases, respectively. No intragenomic analogy is detected when using dataset e, because all
clusters (from a particular enzymatic activity) with
sequences from the same species are joined. These cases of
intragenomic analogy were not related to a particular metabolic pathway.
One example of intragenomic analogy can be seen in the
fructose and mannose metabolism (KEGG map 00051),
where two unrelated sequences of phosphomannomutase
(EC 5.4.2.8) were found in the L. major genome. A bibliographic search revealed almost no data besides the identification of these twelve enzymatic Activities in L. major,
neither were we able to find systematic studies of intragenomic analogy in general.

Discussion
We described in this work AnEnPi, a tool that can be used
for the annotation and detection of analogous enzymes

[19], improving the understanding of the biochemical
pathways of the species under analysis. It offers functionalities for clustering, annotation, or pairwise comparisons
between different species, intended for the identification
and improvement of annotation of putative analogous
enzymes.
Other tools like KAAS [20] or KOBAS [21] also perform
whole genome annotation of enzymes, but AnEnPi is
unique in the detection, comparison and visualization of
events of analogy. In the advanced parameter settings,
each threshold can be modified, such as for clustering,
which should be of use for a large group of users.
The identification of structurally unrelated enzymes sharing the same enzymatic activity may reveal new catalytic
mechanisms, lead to studies on the origin and evolution
of biochemical systems and pathways, and also provide
new candidates for drug design and development [22].
AnEnPi is an implementation of a methodology designed
to help in the identification and annotation of putative

events of independent origin of enzymatic activities
through the clustering of their primary sequences [23].
AnEnPi also provides information for a more detailed
reconstruction of metabolic pathways, including the significance of similarity scores and the presence/absence of
alternative forms of a given enzymatic activity.
It is not a simple task to determine if two different proteins are derived from the same ancestor. Two homologous proteins may lack major sequence similarity and yet
share a common origin, for example after many years of
evolution [8]. The cut-off used in this work, a similarity
score of 120, is based on the observation that there is a
lack of similarity between the tertiary structures of proteins below this value [7].
Still, it is possible that two enzymes assigned by AnEnPi as
analogous are in fact derived from the same ancestor but
have diverged up to a point where their primary sequences
no longer share recognizable similarity. Molecular modeling techniques, together with appropriate evolutionary
methods, could be used to ascertain that the tri-dimensional structures and sequences of the enzymes assigned
as analogous are indeed different, suggesting their independent origin.
To overcome some of these difficulties, methods to
deduce functional information from a certain gene in the
absence of sequence data have been recently proposed
[24]. Needless to say, most approaches rely on high-quality annotation. As a matter of fact, problems with the data
structure of some databases may create undesirable biases
in our analyses. For instance, we have observed that annotation for a specific enzymatic activity for one particular
subunit of a multimeric enzyme is commonly 'inherited'
by all other subunits composing that enzyme. If these subunits are encoded by unrelated genes and do not have the
same function, false cases of analogy will be computed.
False cases of analogy will also appear for enzymatic activities that are dependent on the simultaneous presence of
more than one type of subunit to form the catalytic site. In
other words, if a hetero-multimeric enzyme is composed
of subunits with different origins, AnEnPi may interpret
the lack of similarity between said subunits as another
case of analogy.
Although we have so far no automatic way to further
refine our dataset, the distribution pattern of species over
the clusters of a given enzymatic activity may indicate the
presence of false positives and therefore serve as a criterion for their identification: the presence of representatives (proteins) from the same organism in several clusters
would mean that that organism has several unrelated
enzymes able to fulfill the same metabolic step. While this
may be real, it is likely that a substantial part of these

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/544

events are indeed annotation artifacts. In general, our
results were congruent with the available literature on the
subject (Table 2).
It is thus important to discriminate between i) two (or
more) subunits of a given heteromultimeric enzyme
encoded by unrelated genes and ii) two (or more)
enzymes actually sharing the same function, also encoded
by unrelated genes. Table 1 displays the results found
when applying these criteria to improve the dataset.
Most likely, the majority of the clusters with only one representative sequence are possibly cases derived from
wrong annotations or cases of very divergent sequences,
which are not included in other clusters due to the cut-off
used. As an example, analysis of T. brucei data produced
14 singlets. The annotation of the metabolic pathways in
this organism was done manually [25], and results
entered in the KEGG database.
The user should choose the best dataset for his purposes.
To be conservative, we have employed in most of our
analyses the dataset D, minimizing the number of false
positives (and consequently probably loosing other real
cases of analogy). Using the dataset E, though very restrictive and probably an underestimation, we obtained a set
of analogies with a higher probability of being true cases,
without possible errors due to multimeric proteins; in
fact, even after applying all these criteria for data filtering,
still 8.6% of all enzyme classes have potential cases of
analogy. No doubt, a better handling of inconsistencies
generated during the annotation of multimeric enzymes
would improve the identification and provide a better
estimation of the frequency and distribution of the cases
of intragenomic analogy.
The ability to identify potential cases of analogy between
genes from two different species (Figure 3), as well as differences in assigned functions, can be used to indicate the
possibility of alternative pathways or disclose candidates
for drug development. One example analyzed in more
detail is fumarate hydratase (EC 4.2.1.2.) from H. sapiens
and L. major, whose sequences were assigned to distinct
clusters. AnEnPi can help by producing a list of shared
enzymatic activities between the two organisms without
detectable similarity at their primary level, reflecting substantial differences between their folding patterns. Also,
the overall pattern of similarity scores shown in Figure 2
suggests that fumarate hydratase is evolving in distinct
ways, depending on the group of organisms in question.
More detailed studies are underway to investigate these
points.
Currently, we are developing a database with all putative
analogy events stored in a comprehensive way, linked to

updated, with the inclusion of information from hundreds of new organisms.

Conclusion
AnEnPi is a versatile tool designed to assist the user in the
identification, clustering and annotation of analogous
enzymes. Its modular structure allows its utilization in
other contexts. Addition of color codes to represent biological attributes allows for a better visualization of metabolic pathways, with more meaningful biological
information, facilitating the interpretation of the results.
