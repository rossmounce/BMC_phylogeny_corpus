Abstract
Background: There is a frequent need to obtain sets of functionally equivalent homologous
proteins (FEPs) from different species. While it is usually the case that orthology implies functional
equivalence, this is not always true; therefore datasets of orthologous proteins are not appropriate.
The information relevant to extracting FEPs is contained in databanks such as UniProtKB/SwissProt and a manual analysis of these data allow FEPs to be extracted on a one-off basis. However
there has been no resource allowing the easy, automatic extraction of groups of FEPs – for
example, all instances of protein C.
We have developed FOSTA, an automatically generated database of FEPs annotated as having the
same function in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot which can be used for large-scale analysis. The method
builds a candidate list of homologues and filters out functionally diverged proteins on the basis of
functional annotations using a simple text mining approach.
Results: Large scale evaluation of our FEP extraction method is difficult as there is no goldstandard dataset against which the method can be benchmarked. However, a manual analysis of five
protein families confirmed a high level of performance. A more extensive comparison with two
manually verified functional equivalence datasets also demonstrated very good performance.
Conclusion: In summary, FOSTA provides an automated analysis of annotations in UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot to enable groups of proteins already annotated as functionally equivalent, to be
extracted. Our results demonstrate that the vast majority of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot functional
annotations are of high quality, and that FOSTA can interpret annotations successfully. Where
FOSTA is not successful, we are able to highlight inconsistencies in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
annotation. Most of these would have presented equal difficulties for manual interpretation of
annotations. We discuss limitations and possible future extensions to FOSTA, and recommend
changes to the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot format, which would facilitate text-mining of UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot.

Background
It is often necessary to compare the 'same' gene or gene
product (protein) in different species. By the 'same' pro-

tein, we mean an orthologue that performs an equivalent
function or functions. Obtaining lists of functionallyequivalent proteins (FEPs) is fundamental for compara-

tive and evolutionary genomics, and downstream proteomic studies [1]. The particular motivation for the
current work was obtaining lists of FEPs to examine residue conservation scores and to aid in understanding the
effects of mutations on protein function in the context of
a large-scale automated analysis pipeline, SAAPdb [2].
Proteins that have diverged in function (either by gaining
or losing functionality) will show differences at key functional residues. We therefore needed a reliable automatic
method for extracting groups of FEPs from UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot.
Consider, for example, the HOX family of genes, which is
a large family of transcription factor proteins containing
the well characterised homeobox motif. These proteins
are well conserved across species and are believed to be
critical in embryogenesis, oncogenesis and differentiation
processes such as haematopoiesis [3,4]. HOX proteins are
representative of large protein families in that there are
several paralogues within a species (thirteen in the case of
the human HOX family [3]), and each paralogue can be
involved in several distinct aspects of the same biological
process. A sequence alignment of such evolutionarily
related, but functionally different, proteins would contain
significant noise, and obscure much of the genuine functional conservation between true FEPs.
While homology does not imply functional equivalence,
it is also not possible to use functional data alone to identify FEPs. Proteins can converge on similar functions without being evolutionarily related. For example, subtilisin
(EC 3.4.21.62) and trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) have evolved
separately in bacteria and vertebrates respectively; they
differ significantly in protein sequence, structure and fold,
yet the same three amino acids form the catalytic triad in
both proteins [5]. Aligning such functionally similar, but
evolutionarily unrelated, proteins is meaningless; we are
interested in proteins which are both homologous and
functionally equivalent.
Two entities are homologous if they have a common evolutionary origin. An orthologous relationship denotes that
this common origin was a speciation event, whereas paralogues are related by a gene duplication [6]. Paralogues,
having been derived via a mechanism for functional divergence, are likely to perform different functions [7]. While
orthologues generally perform the same function, it is
possible for the function to diverge, particularly when
orthologues are evolutionarily distant [6]. For example,
Shibata et al. [8] showed that although the general function of exportin-5 proteins (nuclear export of miRNAs and
tRNAs) is conserved across different species, substrate specificity varies. Further, the AGAMOUS gene in Arabidopsis
is involved in carpel and stamen development, but the
two orthologues in maize have specialised: ZAG1 is highly

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/418

expressed during carpel development, and ZMM2 is
expressed during stamen development [9]. It is clear then
that orthology need not imply strict functional equivalence, and it follows that sets of orthologues, defined by
methods such as Inparanoid [10], C/KOG [11,12] and
TOGA [13], are not appropriate as lists of FEPs. Further,
these methods are computationally intensive and as such
are often limited to small species sets.
The identification of true FEPs requires consideration of
features such as functional assays, interaction networks,
expression data and so forth. UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is a
carefully annotated databank of protein sequences that
includes functional annotations. While many of these are
transferred through orthology, where there is experimental evidence for function, it will be included. Thus, short
of conclusive experimental studies, the most reliable way
of identifying families of FEPs is first to identify families
of homologues in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and then to
examine the annotations to find a set of proteins that are
annotated as performing the same function or functions.
It is, of course, possible that annotations in UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot will be incorrect, but as UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
is updated on a regular basis, it is expected that these
annotations will represent the most up-to-date state of our
knowledge of protein function, and errors in annotations
will be corrected with future releases.
While it is perfectly possible to perform this analysis on an
individual basis by searching UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot for
homologues and comparing the annotations manually,
there is a pressing need for an automatically updated
resource that simply lists families of FEPs in UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot. Several methods exist that exploit database
annotations to identify related proteins [14-17], however
there has been no resource that very simply provides sets
of FEPs annotated as having the same function in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot in an easily-accessible format, with
extensive coverage of multiple proteomes.
We have developed FOSTA (Functional Orthologues from
SwissProt Text Analysis), which automates the process
that one would perform manually to extract a family of
FEPs from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. It considers UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot proteins for inclusion in groups of FEPs
(FOSTA families) rooted around human proteins. It
refines an initial candidate list of homologues on the basis
of functional annotation similarity, to distinguish FEPs
from functionally diverged homologues (FDHs). To
assess functional annotation similarity, we employ simple
text-mining techniques to compare UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
description fields.

Results and discussion
Evaluating FOSTA is difficult because no gold-standard
dataset exists. In addition, it is difficult to design an evaluation procedure to isolate the performance of FOSTA
itself from the quality of the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotations that FOSTA interprets. To assess the FOSTA method,
we need to assess whether FOSTA is grouping proteins
correctly into functionally equivalent groups given the
functional annotations, rather than assessing whether the
functional annotations are of sufficient detail to infer genuine functional equivalence. However, it is also very
important to assess the latter, as FOSTA is dependent on
the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotations.
As such, FOSTA has been evaluated in three phases. The
first involves manual interpretation of the results of several large protein families, some chosen at random, and
some chosen as known problematic cases. This phase
assesses how well FOSTA can interpret functional annotations, and infer functional equivalence compared with
manual interpretation. The second phase benchmarks
FOSTA against a fully manually annotated dataset, and a
larger partially annotated dataset. This phase not only
indicates whether FOSTA performs well, but also assesses
whether the annotations are good enough to infer functional equivalence. The final phase of evaluation involves
comparing UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot with InParanoid [10], a
popular method for identifying orthologues.
FOSTA results are available at http://www.bioinf.org.uk/
fosta/, by searching with the UniProtKB/SwissProt protein
ID of interest. Results in this paper are for UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot version 53.0 (29th May 2007). The full set of
FOSTA results may also be obtained in XML format, as can
the results for a single human protein. A comprehensive
help service is provided online, and updates will be performed every two months.
An overview of FOSTA families
Before presenting the analysis of our method, we provide
a brief description of the dataset. With a view to summarising the FOSTA dataset, we have calculated the 'UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot proteome coverage' for each species
described in FOSTA. This has been calculated as NF/NSP,
where NSP is the number of proteins from that species that
are described in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (i.e., the size of the
'UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot proteome') and NF is the number
of proteins from that species described in FOSTA. Therefore, a species which is fully represented in FOSTA with
respect to its UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot proteome would have
a UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot proteome coverage of 100%,
while a species with none of its UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
proteins represented in FOSTA would have a UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot proteome coverage of 0%. Of the 11126 species represented in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot version 53.0,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/418

just over half (52.73%) are not represented by FOSTA.
This will in part be due to differing annotation formats of
very remote species, but will also in part be due to distant
species having very few proteins in common with the
Human proteome. More positively, 2550 species
(22.92%) are fully represented in FOSTA. Of course, many
of these proteomes will be small, but nevertheless, it is
encouraging that almost a quarter of UniProtKB/SwissProt species are fully represented in FOSTA.
The most common family size is two: 25.48% (3793/
14884) of FOSTA families with a non-human member
have two members; this usually corresponds to an exclusively Human/Murine FOSTA family. These are not only
the most well represented species in UniProtKB/SwissProt version 53.0, they are also the most extensively and
similarly annotated. 37.25% of FOSTA families (5545)
have five or more members, and only 1.85% (275) have
more than 50 members.
With respect to how FEP relationships are formed, most
FOSTA families are formed exclusively using the protein
prefix match, i.e., all members share the same protein prefix. However, 42.10% (6266/14884) of FOSTA families
contain at least two different protein prefixes. Furthermore, of the 22 871 protein prefixes recorded in FOSTA,
5.42% are found to exist in more than one FOSTA family.
This indicates that, although UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot protein prefixes are very often reliable, incorporating additional information derived from the description field is
beneficial in identifying FEP relationships.
HOX proteins
In the introduction, we discussed the family of HOX proteins as an example of a large family of proteins with multiple paralogues in each species. Here we assess the
performance of FOSTA (and – by proxy – the quality of
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotations) when assigning the
Zebrafish (Danio rerio) FEP to Homo Sapiens homeobox
protein Hox-B7. There is a body of literature on the problem of elucidating HOX gene evolution, which is difficult
in Zebrafish given the extensive polyploidy in its evolutionary history [18-20].

The BLAST search identifies 83 Zebrafish candidate FEPs
and the filtering process assigns HXB7A_DANRE [SwissProt:Q8AWY9] to the FOSTA family of HXB7_HUMAN
[Swiss-Prot:P09629]. There are 24 Zebrafish FDHs that
have higher sequence similarity to HXB7_HUMAN than
the assigned FEP. These proteins, the FEP and the root
human protein are listed in Table 1, along with their UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotations and their sequence identity to HXB7_HUMAN. It is clear that HXB7A_DANRE
should be identified as the FEP given the similarity of its
description to that of HXB7_HUMAN; this would be

selected in a manual analysis of these candidates, despite
its lower sequence identity.
Several sites of functional relevance have been identified
for HXB7_HUMAN (Table 2). These functional sites have
been extracted from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotations
and a mutagenesis study by Yaron et al. (2001). Figure 1
shows the alignment of the HXB7_HUMAN and the four
confidently assigned FEPs with HXB7A_DANRE and the
other fifteen Danio rerio candidates in the functionally relevant areas. Despite globally having the lowest sequence
identity to HBX7_HUMAN of all the Zebrafish proteins
shown in Figure 1, it is clear that HXB7A_DANRE has the
highest conservation at functionally critical sites. Across
residues 126 to 133, HXB7A_DANRE only differs from
HXB7_HUMAN at the position of a putative PBX binding
site, unlike the other Danio rerio proteins which all differ
in a known sequence motif. The homeobox region (which
also includes crosslinking sites) is highly conserved across
all of the Zebrafish proteins, and again, conservation is
highest in HXB7A_DANRE. None of the Zebrafish proteins show conservation at residues 203 and 204, which
describe a putative CKII target site [3]. It is possible that
this functional site has been wrongly predicted; however,

this is unlikely as it is absolutely conserved across the five
mammalian species. It is more likely that this region is no
longer functional in the Danio rerio lineage, or that this is
a recently acquired functionality in the mammalian clade.
A solved annotation problem: PROC_HUMAN
The UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID consists of a protein name
followed by an underscore and the species name. It was
our initial assumption that the protein name part of the
ID was a unique name used to label FEPs [21]. However,
while analysing human protein C (PROC_HUMAN)
using UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot version 50.6, it was evident
that this approach was unreliable. The 'PROC' prefix was
in forty different species to describe three different proteins: Procalin in one species (PROC_TRIPT, [SwissProt:Q9U6R6]), protein C in 11 species (e.g.,
PROC_HUMAN, [Swiss-Prot:P04070]), and pyrroline-5carboxylate reductase in the remaining 28 species (e.g.,
PROC_ECOLI, [Swiss-Prot:P0A9L8]) (UniProtKB/SwissProt version 53.0). A previous version of FOSTA was successful in correctly assigning only true examples of protein
C to the FEP group, and analysis of human pyrroline-5corboxylate reductase results highlighted the inconsisten-

UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot makes no guarantee that the protein prefix is a unique identifier, instead describing it as a
'mnemonic code', but it is stressed that work is ongoing to
standardize protein nomenclature:
"Ambiguities regarding gene/protein names are a major problem in the literature and it is even worse in the sequence databases which tend to propagate the confusion... UniProt is
constantly striving to further standardize the nomenclature for
a given protein across related organisms" (http://
www.expasy.org/cgi-bin/lists?nameprot.txt).
Although this standardisation is discussed only with
respect to protein names, and not the protein prefix elements of the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot IDs, it is evident from
the timings of prefix updates for protein C and pyrroline5-carboxylate reductase proteins since UniProtKB/SwissProt version 53.0 that UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot does aim to
standardize protein prefixes. If this ID was used consistently across all proteins in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot there
would be no need for FOSTA.
Manual analysis of five protein families
To evaluate FOSTA, a manual analysis of five protein families was carried out. The focus was the description fields,
and whether the description matches by FOSTA were
appropriate. The first was trypsin-1 (TRY1_HUMAN,
[Swiss-Prot:P07477]), which was chosen because it
belongs to the large serine protease family of proteins. The
remaining four – glucose-6-phosphate isomerase
(G6PI_HUMAN, [Swiss-Prot:P06744]), aminopeptidase
N (AMPN_HUMAN, [Swiss-Prot:P15144]), ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX51 (DDX51_HUMAN, [SwissProt:Q8N8A6]) and protoheme IX farnesyltransferase
(COX10_HUMAN, [Swiss-Prot:Q12887]) – were chosen
at random. The results are summarised here (more
detailed discussion is available in the Additional Files).
All results are available by searching for the root protein at
http://www.bioinf.org.uk/fosta/.

Fifteen of the FEPs identified for TRY1_HUMAN are
clearly trypsin molecules (the other three are closely
related serine proteases). It is notable that all five questionable assignments are derived from insect species; it
may be that trypsin genes have diverged and/or duplicated in insect species, or it may be that the naming conventions for trypsin proteins are quite different in insect
species. To assign FEPs to AMPN_HUMAN, FOSTA is
required to discriminate between multiple different families of aminopeptidases. Of the twenty four FEPs that are
identified, only seven would require further investigation
to confirm the pairing and the same requirement would
apply to manual analysis of the annotations.
DDX51_HUMAN belongs to a large family of 'DEAD box
helicases'; identifying functional equivalence in such a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/418

large family of proteins is a difficult task. Nevertheless,
three of the five fully sequenced proteins identified by
FOSTA are correct (according to the manually confirmed
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot family/domain classifications
given for the DEAD box helicases); the remaining two are
from different subfamilies. The results for the two remaining proteins – G6PI_HUMAN and COX10_HUMAN – are
very robust.
The vast majority of the FEP assignments considered in
this section are correct, and no results are clearly wrong.
Where results are questionable, it is not clear whether differing naming conventions across species are hindering
the identification of the true FEP, or whether protein function has diverged in other species. However, it should
again be stressed that a manual analysis of UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot entries for these families is no more effective
than FOSTA.
Further Benchmarking
Evaluation of FEP extraction is difficult as no gold standard, large, manually annotated dataset of one-to-one FEP
pairings is available. It is important to note that FOSTA is
simply an automated assimilation of existing information
that has been curated; it is not a method for inferring functional relationships from low level data. In other words,
rather than find novel functional relationships, FOSTA
aims to extract functional relationships described in
curated UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotation.

Nevertheless, we have benchmarked the FOSTA results
against two datasets: the large, partially manually annotated PIRSF dataset [22] and a refinement of Hulsen et al.'s
manually curated dataset of six protein families that has
been used previously to evaluate orthologue identification methods [23] (the refinement procedure identified
the true one-to-one pairings in the one-to-many sets).
FOSTA is designed to be conservative in the FEP assignments it makes: it is more important to minimise the
number of false positives than to minimise the number of
false negatives. Therefore, the most appropriate performance statistic with which to evaluate FOSTA is the positive
predictive value (PPV): the proportion of positive predictions that are correct, TP/(TP + FP). To provide an overall
performance statistic, we also report the Matthews Correlation Coefficients (MCC). Further performance statistics
(sensitivity and specificity) are included in the Additional
Files.
PIRSF evaluation
The Protein Information Resource (PIR) is a widely used,
publicly available resource, and is part of the UniProtKB
consortium. With a view to the standardization of accurate propagation of protein annotations, PIR has devel-

oped the PIRSF (PIR super family) classification system
for UniProtKB proteins [22]. However, unlike FOSTA it
does not identify FEPs as it contains many-to-many
orthologous pairings.

goals, it is not possible to compare FOSTA directly with
the methods evaluated by Hulsen et al., but we can evaluate FOSTA using a subset of the TO data.
The TO dataset supports many-to-many orthologous pairings where a human protein can map to one or more proteins in another species, and vice versa. To evaluate
FOSTA, these data were manually refined to include only
those TO pairings that can be confidently identified as
true one-to-one orthologous pairings, where both proteins
can be mapped to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (c.f. Refined and
TO in Table 4). This refinement process removes the TLR
dataset from the analysis, as no definitive one-to-one
orthologous pairings could be identified through manual
inspection.

FOSTA was benchmarked against all one-to-one orthologous relationships between UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot proteins that are listed in PIRSF families as 'regular' members
('associate' members can be alternative splice variants,
which should not be FEPs), at all four levels of curation,
where PIRSF families with a curation status of 'Full/Desc'
have the highest level of manual curation, and families
with a curation status of 'None' have not been manually
curated.
It is evident from Table 3 that FOSTA performs extremely
well on the PIRSF protein families according to the PPV
and specificity metrics that are particularly important.
However, it also demonstrates reasonably high sensitivity
and very high MCC scores.

The results are summarised in Table 4. FOSTA demonstrates perfect performance in the HBB, HOX, SMm and
SMc families, identifying all refined true-orthologue pairings, and avoiding any false positive FEP assignments.
However, FOSTA identified only one of the refined
human/worm nuclear receptor (NR) TO pairs
(NHR67_CAEEL). On closer inspection, it is evident that
the three failures of FOSTA in the NR dataset are a result
of widely varying formats of the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
description field across the two species; for example, the
Homo sapiens proteins tend to be named as "Nuclear
receptor subfamily X group Y member Z" proteins,
whereas the Caenorhabditis elegans proteins are named as
"Nuclear hormone receptor family member nhr-N" proteins. These primary protein names or descriptions are
defined by the species-specific annotation communities
(for example, Human Genome Nomenclature Committee, FlyBase and Caenorhabditis Genetics Centre/Wormbase for Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster and
Caenorhabditis elegans respectively) with additional synonyms obtained by UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot from the literature. Therefore, we cannot strictly attribute the lack of

Refined Hulsen evaluation
Hulsen et al. [23] recently evaluated the performance of
several orthologue identification methods: BBH (bidirectional best hit), Inparanoid [10], KOG [12], OrthoMCL
[24], PhyloGeneticTree [25] and Z 1 hundred (estimating
statistical significance of alignment scores). The benchmarking included comparison with manually annotated
'true-orthologue' (TO) pairs of six protein families. For
human-mouse (Homo sapiens and Mus musculus) pairings,
the protein families used were the homeobox proteins
(HOX), haemoglobins (HBB), and Sm and Sm-like proteins (SMm). For human and worm (Caenorhabditis elegans) TO pairs, the families used were nuclear receptors
(NR), toll-like receptors (TLR), and Sm and Sm-like proteins (SMc).

These methods all aim to identify orthologues and do not
consider functional equivalence. Since they have different

annotation consistency to problems in UniProtKB/SwissProt, as UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is merely reflecting the differing practices of the annotation communities and the
content of the literature. Nevertheless, the lack of consistent description field formatting within UniProtKB/SwissProt limits the extent to which text-mining methods such
as FOSTA can exploit the data.
It is encouraging to note that FOSTA makes only one false
positive assignment in the refined Hulsen dataset. Furthermore, FOSTA does not eliminate any of the one-toone TO pairs: where a FEP relationship is missed, the TO
is retained as a FDH, indicating that our BLAST threshold
is not too conservative.
Comparison with Inparanoid
Inparanoid is a well-known method of constructing sets
of orthologous proteins [10]. It uses BBH (best bi-directional hit) pairs in different species as a 'seed' around
which a cluster of orthologues can be formed. Other
orthologues – or specifically other inparalogues – can be
added to this pairing if they are more similar to one of the
seed orthologues than they are to any other protein in
another species.

Inparanoid does not perform the same task as FOSTA.
FOSTA is specifically interested in identifying functionally
similar proteins whereas Inparanoid is more interested in
identifying the phylogenetic relationships between proteins in different species. As such, where Inparanoid
detects one-to-one orthologous pairs, the results will be
largely complementary, but need not be identical. We
therefore cannot 'benchmark' against Inparanoid: it is not
the gold standard dataset. However, by identifying one-toone orthologous pairings in the Inparanoid dataset that
FOSTA rejects as FEPs, we have a dataset of proteins that
we can consider as more difficult test cases. For convenience, we will refer to one-to-one orthologous pairings in
the Inparanoid dataset as 'Inparanoid pairs' or IPs, and IPs

that FOSTA does not consider functionally equivalent as
'rejected IPs'.
Columns 1–3 in Table 5 describe how many IPs from each
species were successfully mapped to UniProtKB/SwissProt IDs, and therefore how many IPs from each species
can be compared to FOSTA. 27069 IPs were extracted
from Inparanoid v6.1, of which 26073 (96.32%) are verified by FOSTA. Of the 996 IPs that are not found in
FOSTA, 125 are rejected in favour of another UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot protein from the non-human species (these IPs
will be described as 'conflicting' IPs); in the remaining
871 IPs, FOSTA fails to assign any FEP from the nonhuman species to the human protein ('rejected' IPs).
These datasets have been further 'cleaned' to remove those
IPs that either (i) cannot be found by FOSTA or (ii) are
clearly correct in FOSTA. 43 of the 125 conflicting IPs
appear to be wrong in Inparanoid, since the FEP that
FOSTA assigns matches the human protein confidently
using the protein prefix match (manual analysis confirms
this conclusion); for example, FOSTA identifies
ADA2A_RAT as a FEP of ADA2A_HUMAN, while Inparanoid assigns ADA2C_RAT as the FEP in Rattus norvegicus.
A further five of the conflicting IPs appear to be wrong as
the non-human protein chosen by Inparanoid is assigned
as a FEP using a protein prefix match elsewhere in FOSTA.
For example, Inparanoid assigns SPDYA_MOUSE to the
FOSTA family of SPDYC_HUMAN, while FOSTA assigns
SPDYB_MOUSE and confidently assigns SPDYA_MOUSE
to the FOSTA family of SPDYA_HUMAN. 36.74% of the
871 rejected IPs cannot be identified by FOSTA: 26.98%
are not found using a BLAST threshold of 10-2 and 1.15%
involve short human proteins that FOSTA does not analyse (see Methods). A further 75 rejected Inparanoid
assignments are found to be wrong: FOSTA assigns the
non-human protein elsewhere on the basis of a protein
prefix match.

This leaves a 'clean' dataset of 77 overlooked IPs and 551
rejected IPs. In a random sample of ten of the overlooked
IPs (see Additional Files), three FOSTA assignments and
one Inparanoid assignment appear to be correct. There is
not enough evidence in the six remaining overlooked IPs
to ascertain which assignment might be correct; however,
four of the six remaining IPs are flagged as less reliable
sequence matches by FOSTA and could therefore be
removed from the dataset.
A random sample of 28 IPs (approximately 5%) were
selected from the rejected dataset (see Additional Files).
Note that the IPs described in this dataset are not necessarily correct; however we can use the IPs as examples of difficult test cases, and hypothesize why FOSTA might not
identify them. Most of the IPs are rejected by FOSTA due
to uninformative or sparsely annotated DE fields. A significant number arise from large, densely populated protein

families in which functional relationships are hard to elucidate.
Only two highlight where the FOSTA functional match
methodology may lack sensitivity; these are shown in
Table 6. The first example – CC45L_HUMAN/
CDC45_YEAST – suggests that mapping from acronyms to
long forms and vice versa may be valuable in future version of FOSTA; in this example, CDC would be extended
to 'Cell division control'. In the second FGF17_HUMAN/
FG17B_DANRE example, some flexibility in names and
numbers used by the matching machinery would lead to
these two proteins being identified as FEPs. However,
introducing such additional flexibility without careful
consideration would increase the likelihood of false positives being introduced into the FOSTA dataset.

The Inparanoid data are mapped to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
using UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot cross-references. Unfortunately using the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot cross-references to
map from the Inparanoid ENSEMBL protein IDs to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot sequences results in a biased dataset:
the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot sequences with explicit crossreferences are likely to be well-annotated. Nevertheless, it
is reassuring that where the Inparanoid dataset does identify one-to-one pairings between UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
proteins, FOSTA confirms 95.99% in a large dataset (27
069 protein pairs) in a wide variety of species (Apis mellifera, Bos taurus, Conis familiaris, Ciona intestinalis, Danio
rerio, Dictyostelium discoideum, Drosophila melanogaster,
Drosophila pseudoobscura, Gallus gallus, Gasterosteus aculeatus, Macaca mulatta, Monodelphis domestica, Mus musulus,
Oryza sativa, Pan troglodytes, Rattus norvegicus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Tetraodon nigroviridis and Xenopus tropicalis).
Further, there are no FOSTA assignments that appear spurious.

Conclusion
FOSTA is a novel method that extracts functionally equivalent proteins (FEPs) from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
database by 'reading' the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotations. As such, it is a grouping of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
proteins that are annotated similarly. We take advantage
of the fact that UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotations are the
result of many hours of manual annotation, and should
encapsulate all knowledge available to the annotator at
the time.
Since FOSTA simply assimilates existing annotations, it is
difficult to separate the performance of the FOSTA method,
from the quality and consistency of annotations in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Manual analysis of eight FOSTA families, two benchmarking evaluations and a comparison to
the popular but quite different Inparanoid method indicate that FOSTA performs well and that UniProtKB/SwissProt annotations are generally of high quality. In addition
to providing researchers with genuine FEP families for
tasks such as studying sequence conservation, FOSTA
could be used to provide datasets to evaluate function prediction methods.
Given the methodology, FOSTA has a few limitations.
Firstly, FOSTA is clearly dependent on UniProtKB/SwissProt annotations. Any method based on database annotations is potentially problematic as it relies on possibly
mistaken, incomplete, inconsistent, ambiguous or outdated information. However, the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
database is considered to be the gold standard for protein
annotation (our benchmarking results reflect that the
annotations are indeed very reliable), and annotations are
constantly revised (for example, 210454 annotation revisions were made between release UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/9/418

v52.0 and UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot version 53.0 http://
www.expasy.ch/txt/old-rel/relnotes.53.htm). The continuous revision of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot with the regular
update of FOSTA ensures that FOSTA FEP assignments can
only improve in parallel with UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot. Secondly, clearly only proteins described in UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot can be assigned to FOSTA families. Given that
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot is growing at an exponential rate
(http://expasy.org/sprot/relnotes/relstat.html) and that it
is the aim to include all proteins in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot,
this limitation is not considered significant.
If FOSTA cannot discriminate between two candidate
FEPs on the basis of function, it will choose the candidate
with the higher sequence identity to the root; only 6047
of FEP assignments (5.00%) are made on this basis. Any
sequence matching is undesirable, as high sequence similarity does not necessarily imply precise functional equivalence. It may be avoided if more sensitive information
extraction methods could be implemented to improve
functional discrimination. UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot keywords and GO terms may have some value, but these tend
to be at a higher level of annotation and are unlikely to
improve discrimination of very detailed functional information. While automatic acronym resolution and character-based fuzzy matching might improve performance,
more sophisticated natural language processing methods
[26] would not be expected to help, as the text being
examined is simply a list of nouns. Alternatively, a more
sensitive sequence matching protocol could be implemented where annotated functional residues, or a consensus profile of FEPs already assigned with high confidence
could be used, rather than the whole sequence which may
be misleading. Furthermore, a vocabularly mapping acronyms to their long forms and vice versa, and/or mapping
between known synonyms may improve the functional
comparison step.
FOSTA's requirement for one-to-one FEP relationships
may also be viewed as a limitation. However, we consider
this to be justified. Consider the protein X in species A that
has two homologues Y1 and Y2 in species B. If Y1 and Y2 are
both homologous to X, one must have been derived via a
gene duplication event. Gene duplication is a mechanism
for functional divergence, and we therefore argue that one
of either Y1 or Y2, most likely (though not necessarily) the
one with the poorer sequence identity to X, has acquired
novel, or lost existing, functionality (or is in the process of
doing so), and should not be selected as a FEP.
Currently, FOSTA roots families around human proteins
because we were interested in identifying FEPs to human
proteins, to examine human disease. 58.36% (169523 of
290484) of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot proteins are not
assigned to a FOSTA family in the current version. Using

the median size of a FOSTA family (87), we can estimate
that another 1949 families will be formed if FOSTA were
to cluster around non-human proteins. We propose that a
future version of FOSTA will root FOSTA families around
decreasingly well defined (in terms of proteome coverage
and functional annotation in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot) species, until all proteins are assigned to a FOSTA family.
While we intend to address this in future versions, it must
be noted that human proteins are the most thoroughly
annotated, and it is unclear whether proteins from other
organisms will be annotated well enough to identify functional equivalencies across species.
More generally, a controlled vocabulary for UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot description fields which would allow description of all proteins across all species, would allow text
mining to make more reliable hypotheses. This might be
implemented as a second, computer-friendly DE-type
field, keeping the existing descriptions for human inspection. In addition, it would be desirable to move some
information from the description field into separate tags
in the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot flatfile format; for example,
flags for fragmented or hypothetical sequences. Given the
size of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot version 53.0 contains 290484 proteins), the resource must
expect to be interrogated computationally, more so with
every new release. Any effort from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
to make its contents more computationally accessible
would be valuable.
As stated above, a guarantee of unique UniProtKB/SwissProt protein ID prefixes for equivalent proteins in different species would preclude the need for hypotheses to be
drawn by software such as FOSTA. It is clear that the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot team are making efforts to standardise
such annotations across species (http://www.expasy.org/
cgi-bin/lists?nameprot.txt); however it is also clear that
some efforts are not yet propagated fully across all relevant proteins and species. As stated above, the protein C/
pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase case described above
has since been rectified by the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
annotators.
It is clear that not only is the automatic extraction of FEPs
a surprisingly difficult problem, but that it is also very difficult to evaluate these methods. The evaluation that was
performed not only demonstrated that FOSTA performs
well, but also that the vast majority of UniProtKB/SwissProt annotations considered are of high quality. This provides further justification of an annotation-based methods such as FOSTA, and indicates that any concern about
FOSTA's dependence on annotations need not be overemphasized. In addition, we expect that FOSTA will
improve with every revision of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

Methods
FOSTA
Carrying out the task of identifying functionally equivalent proteins for an individual case is relatively trivial: candidate FEPs are identified on the basis of sequence
similarity and the FEP for each species is then identified
by reading the annotations manually. FOSTA is designed
to simulate this simple behaviour on a databank-wide
scale, by examining UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotations to
extract information about equivalences across different
species.

As input, FOSTA takes an entire UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot
release; results presented here are based on UniProtKB/
Swiss-Prot version 53.0. FOSTA roots families of FEPs
(FOSTA families) around human proteins using the three
stage filtering processes shown in Figure 2. Candidates
rejected at filtering stages (2) and (3) are retained and
recorded as functionally diverged homologues (FDHs).
Stage (1) : The sequence filter
The first stage identifies sequence homologues using a
BLAST [27] e-value threshold of 10-2. This list of candidate
FEPs is then refined using the following two filters.
Stage (2) : The functional filter
This stage aims to 'read' the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot annotations. The homologues obtained in the previous stage
are filtered on function using information from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot 'Description' (DE) field and the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID itself. Each homologue identified
by the BLAST search will survive the functional filter if it
matches the root protein in at least one of three levels: (i)
by the protein element of the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot ID,
(ii) by an EC number, or (iii) by matching synonyms at
further multiple levels of specificity from the DE field. All
text comparisons are case insensitive. The DE field text

matches compare synonyms at seven levels of specificity:
(a) a 'direct' match, where the two proteins share an intact
synonym; (b) a 'hyphen' match, where the proteins share
a synonym after hyphen placement is mirrored across
both strings; (c) a 'full containing' match, where one synonym is completely contained within another; (d) a
'mixed containing' match, where one synonym is contained within another synonym, but the words need not
be in the same order; (e) a 'containing 75% words' match,
where 75% of the words of the shorter synonym are also
in the longer synonym; (f) a 'containing 75% length',
where 75% of the words in terms of length of the shorter
synonym are also in the longer synonym; (g) a 'collapsed'
match, where one synonym is a substring of another, after
spaces and punctuation have been removed. Full details
are available on the website. The level (i) protein prefix
match is considered the most reliable functional match
(given that we know all candidates are homologues) and
the level (iii) description match the least reliable functional match. Within the description field match, reliability reduces from (a) the direct match to (g) the collapsed
match. Although the choice of the 75% threshold is somewhat arbitrary, it is unlikely that false matches will be
made, as all candidates have already been screened for
homology.

Stage (3) : The FEP filter
If a protein survives both the sequence and functional filtering stages, it is either the FEP for that species or a homologue which has undergone some (small) degree of
functional divergence. To eliminate the FDHs, only the
best functional match from each species (as defined by the
functional match reliability hierarchy described in stage
(2) above, and in the match hierarchy pyramid shown in
Figure 2, is assigned to the FOSTA family. If two or more
proteins cannot be discriminated functionally – i.e., their
annotations match at the same level of specificity to those
of the root human protein – the protein with the highest
sequence identity is chosen (given that, as discussed in the
Introduction, our objective is to define one-to-one functionally equivalent protein relationships). Note that
sequence identity is used only as a last resort as highest
sequence identity does not necessarily indicate functional
equivalence even amongst close homologues [28,29].

Full details of the method are available at http://www.bio
inf.org.uk/fosta/. FOSTA was run on ≈10 dual-core
Opteron 270 2MHz CPUs using the Sun Grid Engine.
Wall-clock run time is approximately eleven hours. All
code was implemented in Perl using the DBI interface to
the PostgreSQL relational database. Figures were generated using xfig and HTML.

Extracting data from Inparanoid
The XML formats of Inparanoid v 6.1 were obtained by ftp
from http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se and parsed using the
Perl module XML::DOM. All Human/X one-to-one orthologues described by Inparanoid (IPs or Inparanoid pairs)
were extracted. There were fifteen species in which no IPs
were found (Aedes aegypti, Anopheles gambiae, Arabidopsis
thaliana, Caenorhabditis briggsae, Caenorhabditis elegans,
Caenorhabditis remanei,Candida glabrata, Cryptococcus neoformans, Debaryomyces hansenii, Entamoeba histolytica,
Escherichia coliK12, Kluyveromyces lactis, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Takifugu rubripes and Yarrowia lipolytica), leaving
nineteen species with at least one IP to compare with
FOSTA.

As FOSTA groups UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot pairings, all
extracted IPs had to be mapped to UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.
Inparanoid proteins are described using various database
IDs, including Ensembl (Apis mellifera, Bos taurus, Canis
familiaris, Ciona intestinalis, Gallus gallus, Gasterosteus
aculeatus, Macaca mulatta, Monodelphis domestica, Pan troglodytes, Rattus norvegicus, Tetraodon nigroviridis, Xenopus
tropicalis), TAIR (Arabidopsis thaliana), Zfin (Danio rerio),
Dictybase (Dictyostelium discoideum), Flybase (Drosophila
melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura), MGI (Mus
musculus), Gramene (Oryza sativa) and Sanger (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). All relevant cross-references were
extracted from UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot version 53.0; any
contradicting or multiple cross-references (e.g., X → Y, X
→ Z) were not used.

Authors' contributions
LEMM implemented and ran FOSTA, built the web server
and drafted the paper. ACRM conceived and directed the
project, and finalised the manuscript.
