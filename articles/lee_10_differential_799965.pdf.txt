Abstract
Avian influenza virus H9N2 isolates cause a mild influenza-like illness in humans. However, the pathogenesis of the
H9N2 subtypes in human remains to be investigated. Using a human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 as host, we found
that A/Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (H9N2/G1), which shares 6 viral "internal genes" with the lethal A/Hong Kong/156/97
(H5N1/97) virus, replicates efficiently whereas other H9N2 viruses, A/Duck/Hong Kong/Y280/97 (H9N2/Y280) and A/
Chicken/Hong Kong/G9/97 (H9N2/G9), replicate poorly. Interestingly, we found that there is a difference in the
translation of viral protein but not in the infectivity or transcription of viral genes of these H9N2 viruses in the infected
cells. This difference may possibly be explained by H9N2/G1 being more efficient on viral protein production in specific
cell types. These findings suggest that the H9N2/G1 virus like its counterpart H5N1/97 may be better adapted to the
human host and replicates efficiently in human alveolar epithelial cells.
Findings
Genetic characterization and phylogenetic analysis
revealed that there are multiple lineages of H9N2 viruses
isolated from various types of poultry including chickens,
ducks, quail and pigeons. The H9N2 virus lineages found
to be the most prevalent in poultry in southern China
include the H9N2/G1-like lineage represented by A/
Quail/Hong Kong/G1/97 (H9N2/G1) and the H9N2/
Y280-like lineage represented by A/Duck/Hong Kong/
Y280/97 (H9N2/Y280) and A/Chicken/Hong Kong/G9/
97 (H9N2/G9) since 1997 [1]. These H9N2 lineages continued to disseminate in domestic poultry with the development of multiple reassortant subtypes from East Asia
to the Middle East [2]. Additionally, avian-to-mammalian
transmissions of H9N2 viruses were reported in Southeastern China [3].
H9N2 viruses have repeatedly infected humans albeit
causing a mild disease [3-5]. The low pathogenic H9N2
virus is widespread in poultry across Asia and Europe
with ample opportunities for interaction with humans. It
has caused infection in pigs (a putative mixing vessel for
pandemic emergence) and causes severe disease in experimentally infected mice without prior adaptation [6]. The

virus has an affinity for binding sialic acid receptors
found on the human upper respiratory tract [7]. As past
pandemics were not caused by highly pathogenic avian
influenza viruses, the endemic of H9N2 viruses in poultry
as well as their tropism for humans are at least as likely to
cause the potential pandemic as the H5N1 virus, which is
still the focus of attention [8]. Additionally, the H9N2/G1
viruses share six viral genes (viz. PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M and
NS) with the lethal H5N1 viruses causing human disease
in 1997 [1]. Furthermore, an H9N2 avian-human reassortant virus has been shown to have enhanced replication and efficient transmission in ferrets [9]. Thus H9N2
virus group is regarded by the World Health Organization as a potential pandemic candidate. Therefore we
examined the replication characteristics of H9N2 virus
lineages in the human lung epithelial cell line (A549) so
that we may obtain an insight into the pathogenesis of
H9N2 viruses in humans.
To examine the replication efficiency of the H9N2 virus
in human cells, A549 cells were infected with H9N2/G1,
H9N2/Y280 or H9N2/G9 at a multiplicity of infection
(m.o.i.) of 0.01 [10-12]. The culture supernatants were
collected at 6 h, 24 h and 48 h post-infection and the viral
titres were determined by tissue culture infectious dose
(TCID50) assays using Madin-Darby canine kidney
(MDCK) cells. Their replication efficiencies were compared with the human influenza A/Hong Kong/54/98

matrix protein (M1) in the infected cells was examined by
using immunofluorescent staining and Western analysis,
respectively. Positive staining of the NP protein was
found in both H9N2-infected and H1N1-infected A549
cells at 24 h post-infection (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, strong
M1 protein expression was observed in cells infected with
H9N2/G1 at 8 h and 24 h post-infection by using anti-

virus (H1N1). As shown in Fig. 1A, the TCID50 titre of
H9N2/G1 viruses at 24 h and 48 h post-infection were
103.6 and 104.5 per 0.1 ml, respectively. Similar viral titres
were observed in H1N1-infected cells at the corresponding time points. In contrast, both H9N2/Y280 and H9N2/
G9 viruses exhibited poor replication competence in
A549 cells (Fig 1A). Thus our results showed that H9N2/
G1 viruses replicated as efficiently as H1N1 in the human
lung epithelial A549 cells.
Next we examine the host-specific effects on the replication of H9N2 viruses, the leghorn male hepatoma
chicken liver (LMH) cells were infected by H9N2 subtypes or H1N1 virus. We also infected embryonated
chicken eggs with these viruses and their viral titres were
determined by a hemagglutination assay. As shown in Fig.
1B and 1C, the three H9N2 viruses and H1N1 virus replicated to similar levels in LMH cells and embryonated
chicken eggs. Furthermore, we found that all of the influenza viruses replicated well in MDCK cells (Fig. 1D).
Hence, our results showed that all H9N2 subtypes tested
replicated efficiently in MDCK, LMH cells and embryonated chicken eggs.
To delineate the mechanisms underlying the differences
in replication of H9N2 subtypes, we investigated the
infectivity, transcription and translation of different
viruses in A549 cells. A549 cells were first infected by
H9N2/G1, H9N2/Y280, H9N2/G9 or H1N1 at an m.o.i.

body against M1 protein of influenza type A viruses but
not those infected with H9N2/Y280 or H9N2/G9 virus
(Fig 2B). To exclude the possibility of the specificity of the
antibody, we compared the expression of M1 protein in
A549 cells infected with H1N1 or H9N2/G1 virus.
Results similar to the viral titres, there were no significant
differences of M1 protein expression in these two viruses
(Fig. 2C). Next, we measured the mRNA level of M1 protein and acid polymerase protein (PA) in virus-infected
A549 cells at 3 h, 6 h and 24 h post-infection by using
quantitative RT-PCR assay [11]. The coding regions of
the respective viral genes in H9N2 and H1N1 viruses
were amplified by the conserved gene-specific PCR primers. Both M1 and PA mRNA were detected at 3 h postinfection and their levels increased at 24 h post-infection
in H9N2- or H1N1-infected cells (Fig. 3A, B). We found
that there was no significant difference in the level of the
viral mRNA in the cells infected by either virus subtypes.
Taken together, our results showed that the virus entry of
the examined H9N2 subtypes seems comparable but
there is a difference in M1 protein expression in human
lung epithelial A549 cells. However, the discrepancy of
the mRNA synthesis and protein expression in A549 cells
with H9N2/Y280 or H9N2/G9 infection remains to be
investigated.

Since 1999, the H9N2 viruses have been intermittently
isolated from patients manifesting influenza-like symptoms [3,4] and these viruses pose a pandemic threat.
However, the pathogenicity of the avian influenza H9N2
viruses remains to be investigated. Recent studies have
shown that avian or human influenza viruses including
H5N1, H7N1 and H1N1 can infect cells in the human
lung epithelium [13,14]. In addition, a previous report
showed that avian H5N1 virus can replicate both in the
upper and lower respiratory tract [15]. These findings
imply that avian influenza virus other than H5N1 may
have similar replicating ability in human cells and tissues.
In this report, we found that all three H9N2 lineages
tested can infect different cell types including A549 cells,
MDCK and LMH as evident by the detection of H9N2
viral protein NP in the infected cells and embryonated
chicken eggs. Interestingly, only H9N2/G1 virus could
produce a high titre of virus particles in A549 cells comparable to the H1N1 infection. These results suggested
that the disease severity of H9N2/G1-infected patients
may be associated with the replication ability of the virus
in specific cell types. From our results, we showed that
the viral growth efficiency may not be due to the difference of infectivity of the virus subtypes. Instead, we found
that the translation of M1 protein is impaired in H9N2/
Y280 and H9N2/G9. Previous reports have shown that
M1 forms the major structural component of the virion
and plays an important role in virus budding and assembly [16,17]. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying the translational efficiency of H9N2/G1 virus and its
differences from that of the less efficient H9N2/Y280 and
H9N2/G9 viruses in A549 cells remain to be investigated.
Enami et al. previously showed that the NS1 can stimulate the translation of the M1 protein [18]. As the NS1 of
H9N2/G1 is highly conserved to the human pathogenic
H5N1 virus which were found during 1997, it is possible
that the NS1 of H9N2/G1 may lead to a high translational
efficiency on M1 protein production in human host while
the other H9N2 subtypes are unable to do so.
The genetic background of different H9N2 subtypes
(Table 1) may contribute to the differences in their
respective replication ability. In regard to the hemagglutinin (HA) gene, both H9N2/Y280 and H9N2/G9 viruses
belong to the same HA sublineage of H9N2 viruses, while
H9N2/G1 and H5N1/97 viruses belong to a different sublineage [19]. Moreover, H9N2/G1 and H5N1/97 viruses
possess the similar replication complexes that are pathogenic in mice [19]. The H9N2/G1 viruses share six internal genes, including PB2 with the H5N1/97 viruses, while
the H9N2/G9 lineage viruses share PB1 and PB2 genes.
By contrast, the H9N2/Y280 virus does not have this
share features in its viral genome [1]. It has been shown
by other reports that the PB2 protein in H5N1 viruses
contributes to the host adaptation and virus growth in

humans [20,21]. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated
that H5N1/97 viruses replicate efficiently in primary alveolar epithelial cells and the viral titre of the infected cells
is comparable to that of the human influenza H1N1
viruses [22]. However, it is notable that the internal gene
complements of the current Z genotype H5N1 viruses are
different to those of H5N1/97 and H9N2/G1 [23]. Thus,
the adaptation of H5N1 to grow in human cells reflects its
potential ability to cross the species restriction resulting
in its occasional transmission from the avian hosts to
human.
Since both of the H9N2 human isolates from 1999 and
2003 caused mild respiratory symptoms in infected
patients, we postulate that there may be some common
factors that lead to effective infection among those
viruses. The HA, NA, NP genes of H9N2 viruses that
have infected humans belonged to either H9N2/G1 or
H9N2 Y280-like sub-lineages. Interestingly however, irrespective of the derivation of the HA and NA genes, the
PB2, PB1 and M genes of these human isolates all belong
to the H9N2/G1 sublineage. The PA genes of these
viruses belong to either the H9N2/G1 or the contemporary Z genotype H5N1 viruses [4]. It is notable that the
polymerase gene complex and the M gene of the viruses
arise either from the H9N2/G1 - H5N1/97 sublineage or
from the recent H5N1-Z genotype lineage associated
with recent human H5N1 disease but not from the
H9N2/Y280-sublineage. Since H9N2/G9 viruses which
share the H9N2/G1-like PB1 and PB2 genes also fail to
replicate in the human alveolar epithelial A549 cells, it
would possibly implicate the need for all three poly-

merase gene segments and/or the M gene segment for
efficient replication in human cells.
Infection of patients with avian influenza virus subtypes including H4N8, H6N1, and H10N7 is inefficient
and this may be due to the inefficient virus replication
competence in human cells [24]. Here, we demonstrated
the differential replication of H9N2 virus subtypes in
human lung epithelial cells. It provides a cellular model to
investigate the mechanisms of replication of avian influenza viruses in humans, as well as the interaction of viral
proteins with host factors, which may contribute to the
pathogenesis of avian influenza virus.
