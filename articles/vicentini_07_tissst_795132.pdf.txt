Abstract
Background: The nucleotide sequence flanking the translation initiation codon (start codon
context) affects the translational efficiency of eukaryotic mRNAs, and may indicate the presence of
an alternative translation initiation site (TIS) to produce proteins with different properties. Multitargeting may reflect the translational variability of these other protein forms. In this paper we
present a web server that performs computations to investigate the usage of alternative translation
initiation sites for the synthesis of new protein variants that might have different functions.
Results: An efficient web-based tool entitled TISs-ST (Translation Initiation Sites and Secretory
Targets) evaluates putative translation initiation sites and indicates the prediction of a signal peptide
of the protein encoded from this site. The TISs-ST web server is freely available to both academic
and commercial users and can be accessed at http://ipe.cbmeg.unicamp.br/pub/TISs-ST.
Conclusion: The program can be used to evaluate alternative translation initiation site consensus
with user-specified sequences, based on their composition or on many position weight matrix
models. TISs-ST provides analytical and visualization tools for evaluating the periodic frequency, the
consensus pattern and the total information content of a sequence data set. A search option allows
for the identification of signal peptides from predicted proteins using the PrediSi software.

Background
Translation by cytosolic ribosomes generally occurs at the
first AUG in the transcript. However, in eukaryotic
mRNAs, efficient recognition of an AUG codon as a translation initiation site (TIS) depends on several factors, such
as the nucleotide sequence that flanks the site [1-3]. There
is evidence that the context surrounding the initiation
codon contributes to the control of translational initiation [4]. The sequence context of the first AUG codon, in
particular that part located in the untranslated region,
may modulate the efficiency with which it is recognized as

a translation initiation codon [5]. If the first initiation
codon lies in a suitable context, protein synthesis will be
started. When the context is less than favorable, most of
the protein synthesis will start at the next downstream
AUG codon [6]. Moreover, other structural features of the
mRNA are considered important for the efficiency of the
translation initiation at a specific AUG codon, such as: the
proximity of AUG to the 5' end, the secondary structure
upstream and downstream from the AUG codon, the
leader sequence length and the multiple upstream AUG
codons [1,3,7]. Recent studies indicate that start codons of

a large proportion of the human and mouse mRNAs
reside in evolutionary conserved local loop structures, and
some of these structures may be common in mammals
and important for the efficient initiation of translation
[2,8]. The frequency of the nucleotides surrounding the
initiation AUG (context) has been extensively analysed in
sequences available in public databases [9]. The importance of a particular position in a sequence is more clearly
and consistently given by the information required to
describe the pattern. The information in the sequence patterns allows one to investigate how the information is distributed across the sites and to compare one site to
another [10]. Statistical analyses of the AUG initiation
codon context in many organisms identified a preferential
nucleotide frequency in some positions around the AUG.
Recent analyses have revealed variations in the initiation
context between different groups of eukaryotes. Distinct
inter-taxon variations in the AUG context sequences are
repeatedly observed when invertebrates, higher plants
and protozoa are considered separately [11]. For instance,
in vertebrates, C(A/G)CCAUGG was observed to be a consensus sequence [12]. For plant genes, a consensus context
was deduced as c(A/G)(C/A)CAUGGC for monocots and
A(A/C)aAUGGC for eudicots [11,13].
Upstream out-frame AUG may severely affect the translation of a gene, even if surrounded by a poor context [14],
suggesting that upstream AUGs may have a role in keeping the basal translation level of a gene low [5]. Recently
it was demonstrated that downstream AUG codons are
utilized as alternative TISs even in mRNAs with multiple
strong upstream AUGs [7]. Their occurrence must correlate with the start codon context: sub-optimal context
should be accompanied by a higher frequency of downstream AUGs [15]. With this mechanism, called 'leaky
scanning', multiple different proteins can be obtained
from the same mRNA [5]. In this sense AUGs located
downstream of the major coding sequences (CDS), may
play a role in generating protein diversity [2]. The usage of
a closely located downstream in-frame AUG codon as an
alternative TIS can result in full and N-truncated proteins
that may have the same function and be targeted at the
different compartments [15-17]. Since eukaryotic mRNAs
frequently contain TISs in a sub-optimal context [18], the
problems of polypeptide N-end heterogeneity and finding
of the genuine TIS are very topical.
In silico determination of the sub-cellular localization of
the proteins can provide information on their function,
and is dependent on the correct identification of the first
AUG and their potential N-terminally polymorphic
forms. This translational polymorphism may serve as an
important source of diversity in both cytoplasmic and
organelle proteomes [15,17].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/160

Proteins must be localized correctly at the sub-cellular
level to have normal biological functions [19]. When the
final destination is the mitochondria, the chloroplast, or
the secretory pathway, sorting usually relies on the presence of an N-terminal targeting sequence [20]. In the
secretory pathway, proteins designated for export from
the cell are labelled by an N-terminal signal sequence
[21]. These signal peptides are responsible for targeting
proteins to the ER for subsequent transport through the
secretory pathway, and the prediction of signal peptides
has become an important application of genomic and
proteomic investigations. There are known cases of variation in the use of alternative signal peptides, and in the
majority of cases this is due to the exclusion of the signal
peptide from one or more protein products of the same
gene. However in other cases, this variation involves the
replacement of one signal peptide by another signal. For
example, a single gene encoded 48 isoforms of protocadherin using 34 different signal peptides, each encoded by
its own initial exon [22]. Alternative initial exon usage is
the most common mechanism for replacing one signal
peptide with another.
In this paper, we present the TISs-ST (Translation Initiation Sites and Secretory Targets) web server that investigated the usage of alternative TISs for synthesis of new
protein variants possibly possessing different functions.
This server deployed previously annotated complete CDSs
retrieved from the NCBI UniGene database [23] and the
PrediSi prediction program [21] for inspection and evaluation of alternative TISs and also target prediction of the
proteins encoded by this variable site. It can be useful for
finding proteins that have signal peptides in the polymorphic form, for assisting research by evaluating alternative
coding potentials for eukaryotic mRNAs, and in designing
synthetically created genes, especially for maximizing the
translational level of an interesting protein. TISs-ST uses
user-specified sequences and an optional position weight
matrix (PWM) model, derived computationally from a
subset of the NCBI UniGene data set, to infer the consensus around the AUG sites. This subset only includes
sequences previously annotated as complete CDS. The
program determines the consensus sequence and the total
information content around the AUGs in five situations:
(i) first transcript AUG, (ii) second in-frame downstream
AUG, (iii) second out-frame downstream AUG, (iv) all
other in-frame downstream AUGs, and (v) all other outframe downstream AUGs. This information is provided
with the probability of alternative TIS based on the frequency of the AUG codons. The use of these five alternatives in the analyses can provide some advantages, mainly
in the prediction of TIS originating in genes with alternative splicing. All scripts and interfaces were written in Perl
and R languages. This version of program is available at
TISs-ST web server [24].

Implementation
Description of the web server
We developed a web server named TISs-ST. Basically it can
be divided into two subsystems: (i) the web interface system, which is written in the Perl and HTML languages and
(ii) the background process system, which is written in the
Perl and R statistical languages. The web interface subsystem mainly deals with the task of receiving information
from the user and checking the validity of the data submitted. The background processing subsystem computes all
the analytical and prediction tasks: extracts features from
the sequences, computes and displays the consensus
sequences and total information content, and predicts the
signal peptides of the user sequences. We used PrediSi for
the prediction of signal peptides in our implementation
of TISs-ST.

The web interface allows for the easy evaluation of
sequences (provided in FASTA format), for the presence of
putative translation initiation sites and for the prediction
of signal peptides. The TISs-ST interface is designed in
such a way that the user specifies all necessary parameters
in the initial page, and provides many possibilities to
work with the sequence files. The content of a file can be
pasted in the input window, or taken from a directory on
a local computer. The user has the option of setting several
parameters manually.
Input parameters
TISs-ST takes the following input data:

(i) DNA sequence data. This contains one or several
sequences in FASTA format. The sequences can be in a
nucleotide format, where the first ATG codon after the
first 15 base pairs will be considered to be the one that
encodes the initial Methionine. Since the analysis calculates the nucleotide frequencies in a context position, if
the user does not choose to run the analysis with a predefined PWM, the amount of sequences must be bigger in
order to obtain a significant result. A representative sample data is available on the website.
(ii) An optional predefined PWM model for species or
species group data sets. Currently, 32 species data sets are
available on the web server (Table 1) and these data can
also be grouped into 20 data sets (12 phylogenetic Class,
and 8 Phylum or Division).
(iii) A filter for the AUG sites.
(iv) An option for signal peptide prediction in the protein
deduced from the submitted sequence(s). This option
requires the selection of the genetic code used to translate
the DNA sequences.

Output
After submitting the data to the server, the TISs-ST program searches the consensus sequences according to the
parameters selected. While the analyses are running, the
web server shows a checklist of the steps finalized, from
which the user can estimate the total time required for the
analysis. An example of the output of the TISs-ST program
is shown in Figure 1. For each site selected, the final result
is a summary table with detailed information on the analysis of the data set generated. Every AUG flanking site analysed by the program is shown in a separate row of the
result table, including the name of the site analysed, the
number of sequences submitted, the consensus sequence
found, and the total information content with or without
correction for bias (measured in bits). The last column
shows hyperlinks to files that include the amino acid
sequences and the signal peptide prediction of the data
submitted. More detailed information about a consensus
sequence and the probability of localizing alternative
translation initiation sites is provided by hyperlinks at the
top of the graphic results.

In addition to the tabulated output, the result page shows
a graphic representation of the consensus and the information content found at each site analysed. There are also
hyperlinks for each sequence pattern from the user
sequences, the sequence header providing information
about the probability of alternative TIS based on the frequency of AUG codons, and hyperlinks to frequency
tables of this pattern generated in each analysis (Figure 1).
Graphical representation
A typical consensus graphical representation concentrates
the following information into a single graph: the general
consensus of the sequences; the predominance order of
the nucleotides at every position (the most frequent
nucleotides, in a same position, are showed before the less
frequent); the relative frequencies of every nucleotide at
every position; and the amount of information present at
every position in the sequence [25].

TISs-ST uses two different ways to display the graphical
representation of consensus sequences: (i) the information content required to describe the pattern, which is the
total information content (measured in bits) at every position in a site, and (ii) a useful graphical representation for
displaying the global patterns in a set of aligned
sequences, to focus on the periodic frequencies of the
nucleotides in the consensus pattern.
Resources and CDS database
Non-redundant data sets of nucleotide sequences were
compiled from the NCBI UniGene (retrieved August,
2005). Following the removal of sequences not annotated
as 'complete CDS' (not identified previously as putatively

The number of sequences represents the total of unique genes. The sequences were taken from a subset of the NCBI UniGene data set [23]
(retrieved August, 2005). The taxonomic classification was based on the Integrated Taxonomic Information System on-line database [26]. For the
group classification, the phylum or division, and the class were used for the taxonomic level.

and complete coding sequence), only sequences that had
termination codon and had 15 bp before the first ATG
annotated, remained in the data set. For this set,
sequences were grouped according to species, based on
their taxonomic classification in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System on-line database [26]. Species
were also grouped according to their taxonomic level
(phylum or division, and class).
Classifying sequences into AUG site types and consensus
determination
Data sets of fragments flanking the AUG were created
from the -15 to +15 nucleotides of each AUG in every
sequence. All fragments were grouped and the consensus
sequences were determined separately for each AUG (first
AUG, second in-frame downstream AUG, second outframe downstream AUG, all other in-frame downstream
AUGs, all other out-frame downstream AUGs) for each

species and group of species using the 50/75 consensus
rule described by Cavener [9]. The reading frame determination is based on the first AUG from the complete CDS
annotated.
The consensus at a position is computed according to the
following rules, with decreasing order of priority: (i) if a
nucleotide at that position has a relative frequency greater
than 50% and greater than twice the relative frequency of
the second most frequent nucleotide, the nucleotide is
given consensus status that is indicated in uppercase; (ii)
if the sum of the relative frequencies of a pair of nucleotides exceeds 75%, these two nucleotides are given coconsensus status, indicated in uppercase; (iii) if there is a
single most frequent nucleotide, it is given dominant status, indicated in lowercase; (iv) if two bases have the same
highest frequency, they are given co-dominant status that
is indicated in lowercase.

Analysis of the information content at each position
around each AUG site
The method begins by calculating a weight matrix from
the frequencies of each nucleotide at each position of the
aligned sequences. This matrix is then applied to the
sequences to determine the sequence conservation of each
individual site. Additionally we considered the nucleotide
bias in genomes by using a linear noise correction [27].

A PWM model of first AUG site, called Riw (b, l), is created
by using an aligned training set consisting of sequences
from the nucleotides databases described before. The
PWM is computed using the widely accepted information
theoretical approach with some modifications [28,29]. In
TISs-ST, nucleotide biases can be corrected by using the
nucleotide composition observed 15 bases upstream of
the start codon annotated, and the triplet noise can be corrected by using the observed frequency of each nucleotide
at each position of every codon [27]. If a particular base
does not appear in the data set used to create the frequency matrix, then we apply a penalty function that
depends on the sample size n as follows: Riw (b, l)=

1
[28]. Since this weight matrix is created from many
n+2
sequences, it can give statistically significant evaluations
of individual sites, including those used to create the
matrix itself [28].
In a set of submitted sequences, we represent the jth
sequence by a matrix Sj (b, l) that contains only 0's and 1's.
The individual information content of a base (Ri (l)),
given by some manipulation of the Ri (j) [28], is the product between the base and the weight matrix:

â j=1 â b= A S j (b, l)Riw (b, l)

And the total information content of the sites is the Ri:

Testing the TISs-ST
Preparation of training and testing data
The maize data set (n = 518) and Arabidopsis data set (n =
14525) were used. Each of these data sets was used for
training and testing the program. The total sequences were
divided into two equal sets, training and testing. The training set was cross-validated by testing with the testing data
set.
Confusion matrix method
Using the confusion matrix, various measurements of
quality such as accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and the
Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) [30] were determined. In the following equation (3â6), TP refers to true
positives (correctly predicted TIS), TN to true negatives
(correctly predicted non-TIS), FN to false negatives (incorrectly predicted TIS) and FP to false positives (incorrectly
predicted non-TIS).

Results and discussion
In the literature, purines are usually claimed to be important at position -3. This was the case for maize and
tobacco suspension cells [11]. Although the -3 position is
most conserved upstream of the start codon, experimental
evidence in eudicots, showed that changes at the -2 and 1 positions affected translation efficiency at least as much
as changes at the -3 position. For monocots, this effect
seems to be even more pronounced because changing the
C at the -1 and/or -2 position resulted in an approximately
50% reduction in translation efficiency [11]. In Figure 2,
our analysis shows this topic for the chicken data set,
where purines are most conserved upstream of the start
codon (Figure 2A). The same did not occur for the second
in-frame downstream AUG (Figure 2B).
We also performed analyses on the rice and tomato data
sets, and the results of a TISs-ST search of the context surrounding the first translated AUG are shown in Figure 3.
Different consensus patterns for the first AUG were found
in the two data sets, and corroborate the known consensus obtained from the monocot and eudicot species
[11,13].

MCC: This is regarded as a more rigorous measurement to
evaluate the performance of class prediction methods.
MCC equals 1 for perfect predictions, whilst it is zero for
completely random predictions [30].

Specificity and sensitivity test
Specificity and sensitivity are two competing quality
measurements for any two-classifier method. Table 2
shows the specificity and sensitivity of the TISs-ST at the
different threshold levels, as well as the MCC values. At
the highest specificity (0.98), the sensitivity is at 0.30, and
at the highest sensitivity level (0.91), the specificity is reasonable, at 0.63. At a mid-range sensitivity level of 0.61
(with a threshold score of â¥ 40), 61% of all the positives
can be predicted with only 9% FPs, and the best correlation is obtained (MCC = 0.33).

Accuracy test
Prediction can be performed at different levels of specificity and sensitivity by defining various thresholds for the
final score. At each threshold, the numbers for the TPs,
TNs, FPs and FNs are calculated, and based on these values parameters such as accuracy, specificity and sensitivity
are determined using equations (3â5). As seen in Table 2,
the prediction accuracy ranges from 0.64 to 0.95 at the different thresholds.

The current method was applied to a real data set of different mRNA variants produced by differential splicing in
the human phosphodiesterase 9A gene. The PDE9A gene
encodes a cGMP-specific high-affinity phosphodiesterase,
and the physiological implication of the isoforms produced by this gene is not yet known [31,32]. At least 21
different human PDE9A mRNA transcripts have so far
been identified, which are produced as a result of alternative splicing of the 5' exons. The different PDE9A splice
variants could present different translation start codons to
produce the functional protein, allowing for the synthesis
of a variety of polypeptides that differ in their N-terminal
regions and also show differential subcellular localization
[31,32].
We performed analyses on the data set composed of splice
variants that used the first start codon in exon 1 (7 isoforms) and the possible start codon present in exon 8 (5
isoforms). The results of the analyses of these sites are

shown in Figure 4. The isoforms possibly encoded by the
start codon in exon 8 (Figure 4B) showed an information
content (Ri = 8.3 bits) as high as that encoded by the first
start codon in exon 1. This prediction corroborates the
hypothesis that this AUG codon may be an alternative TIS
in the splice variants of the human phosphodiesterase 9A
gene [31].
The observation that sub-optimal AUG contexts are
present in many genes suggests the hypothesis that this
context might be involved in modulation of gene expression. This might be the case for transcripts encoding two
proteins that differ at their N-terminal end [11], which
would reflect in multi-targeting of the protein. Another
instance where modulation of the expression by the AUG
context might be important, concerns transcripts that contain a small open reading frame upstream from the main
open reading frame. The main limitation of TISs-ST is that
target prediction is limited to signal peptides, mainly
because there are only a few free stand-alone tools available for protein sub-cellular localization prediction [33].
These free available tools do not permit one to create
derivative works based on their software, or their applications are time consuming for a web access. Future work
includes making the ability to predict the sub-cellular
localization of proteins from the N-terminal amino acid
sequence available. The analysis described above is based
on the NCBI UniGene data set and the taxonomy classification of Integrated Taxonomic Information System online database [26]. The sequences in the NCBI UniGene
data set are mostly represented by gene-specific EST clusters, and many of them are often annotated as complete
CDS. This makes the determination of reading frames and
the search for the 15 bp upstream of CDS, an easy step.
Additional new taxonomic groups will be included in
future versions. The TISs-ST local data set will be updated
twice a year to incorporate future UniGene updates.

including leaky scanning and reinitiation or internal initiation of the translation. The contributions of these mechanisms remain uncertain but several recent studies suggest
that the impact of at least some of them might be substantial [2,3,7,34-36].
Many databases in this research area are available on the
web. Examples include Transterm, an information
resource devoted to contexts of translation initiation and
termination sites [37], and UTRdb, a curate database of 5'
and 3' untranslated sequences of eukaryotic mRNAs [38].
With these databases, it is possible to obtain the structure
and detect the presence of known regulatory elements in
UTR sequences, and the annotation of experimentally
defined functional motifs from sequence contexts of
annotated translation initiation and termination codons.
But currently no computational tools are available for the
accurate prediction of alternative TIS, and investigations
in this field could contribute to a better understanding of
the complexity of mechanisms used by the cell to expand
the diversity of proteins encoded by the genome. In this
work we have presented a new online web server to evaluate translational variability reflected by alternative TISs.
Comprehensive comparisons of contexts that surround
the alternative TISs are very topical in eukaryotic mRNAs,
and in addition, such translational polymorphism is a
source of variability in cytoplasmic and organellar proteomes [15]. TISs-ST provides a collection of pre-analysed

Figure 2
Information content and differences in the context
between two sites of Gallus gallus. The nucleotide
sequences were selected for the determination of nucleotide
frequency at positions between -15 and +15 (codon AUG
corresponds to position +1 to +3). The application of two
different ways of displaying the consensus sequences allows
one to display the nucleotide periodic frequencies in addition
to the site information content. In the analysis performed a
consensus context was deduced as a"............(G/A).(C/
G)ATGG.............." and "...........(G/C)..(G/C)ATG..............." for
first and second in-frame downstream AUG, respectively.
The total information content consisted of 9.6 and 6.6 bits
for these sites. (A) First AUG site (n = 3135). (B) Second inframe downstream AUG site (n = 1190). The frequency of
each consensus base is indicated on the left Y axis, according
to the 50/75 consensus rule. On the right Y axis, the lines
represent the degree of site conservation measured in bits of
information according to the equation given in the methods
section. The continuous line is the information content without correction, and the broken line is the same information
corrected for bias.
