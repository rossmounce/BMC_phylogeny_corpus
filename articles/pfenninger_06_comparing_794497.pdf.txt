Abstract
Background: Reliable taxonomic identification at the species level is the basis for many biological
disciplines. In order to distinguish species, it is necessary that taxonomic characters allow for the
separation of individuals into recognisable, homogeneous groups that differ from other such groups
in a consistent way. We compared here the suitability and efficacy of traditionally used shell
morphology and DNA-based methods to distinguish among species of the freshwater snail genus
Radix (Basommatophora, Pulmonata).
Results: Morphometric analysis showed that shell shape was unsuitable to define homogeneous,
recognisable entities, because the variation was continuous. On the other hand, the Molecularly
defined Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTU), inferred from mitochondrial COI sequence
variation, proved to be congruent with biological species, inferred from geographic distribution
patterns, congruence with nuclear markers and crossing experiments. Moreover, it could be shown
that the phenotypically plastic shell variation is mostly determined by the environmental conditions
experienced.
Conclusion: Contrary to DNA-taxonomy, shell morphology was not suitable for delimiting and
recognising species in Radix. As the situation encountered here seems to be widespread in
invertebrates, we propose DNA-taxonomy as a reliable, comparable, and objective means for
species identification in biological research.

Background
According to Mayr [1], the initial step of any taxonomic
work is to "sort that portion of the diversity of the individuals which is encountered into easily recognisable and
internally homogeneous groups, and to find constant differences between such groups". In other words, there must
be constant, apparent differences between biological entities in order to separate them into natural groups. This is

true, no matter whether the taxonomic diagnosis is based
on morphological, anatomical, molecular or other traits.
In a second step, the so identified groups can be assigned
to biological species, either already known to science or
not, based on the degree of reproductive isolation to other
such groups [2]. Characters that are found to differ constantly among delimited biological species can then be
used to re-identify them [1].

Traditionally, morphological traits were used for taxonomy. Recently, however, DNA-taxonomy [3,4] has
entered the field, often contradicting traditional views [5].
Therefore, studies comparing traditional taxonomies with
DNA-based results are needed [6], because species delimitation and eventual recognition is not only of interest for
taxonomists and systematics. Species are the fundamental
units in biogeography, ecology, macroevolution, biomonitoring and conservation biology [7-9]. An objective, rigorous taxonomic delimitation of species according to
explicit criteria is therefore a necessary prerequisite for
many studies in these disciplines. In this contribution, we
compared the suitability and efficacy of shell morphology
and sequence variation of a mitochondrial gene for taxonomic purposes in a freshwater snail taxon.
The genus Radix Montfort 1810, formerly included in
Lymnaea, is part of the Lymnaeidae family (Basommatophora). It has a Palaearctic distribution, but the results of
Remigio indicate a paraphyletic status of the Eurasian taxa
on the one side and the mostly East Asian species on the
other [10]. The taxonomy and species determination is
deemed difficult. Currently, five species, Radix ampla, R.
auricularia, R. balthica, R. labiata and R. lagotis are recognised in North-Western Europe [11]. The most recent taxonomic treatment, summarising previous work, states
that species determination based on shell morphology is
difficult, unreliable and should be supplemented by anatomical inspections. The latter are, however, also considered unreliable. Indeed, the indicated intraspecific
variability of the putatively distinctive anatomical measurements largely overlaps among species [11] and therefore seems to be unsuitable for taxonomic distinction. The
issue is further complicated by recent nomenclatorial revisions. The names R. peregra and R. ovata have lost their
validity in favour of R. labiata and R. balthica, respectively
[12], but are still used by some researchers (e.g.[13]).
Species identification in Radix is not only of academic
interest. The genus is e.g. involved in the transmission of
parasitic diseases to humans [14,15]. The study of these
diseases is possibly impaired if the specific identity of the
snail hosts implicated in larvae transmission cannot be
unequivocally determined. Additionally, the presence or
absence of certain Radix species is used to calculate an
indicator of water quality in official assessments [16],
which also requires their consistent and correct recognition. This highlights the need for reliable species identifications in this genus.
We compared the suitability of shell morphology and
DNA-taxonomy to delimit Radix species by focussing on
the following issues:

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/100

• How many evolutionary lineages of Radix exist in NorthWestern Europe and do they correspond to biological species?
• Does the shell variation of North-Western European
Radix fall into separate, distinguishable units that correspond to the species descriptions in the taxonomic literature?
• Is shell variation within and among Radix lineages species specific or influenced by the environment?

Results
MOTU inference with COI
All 81 Radix COI haplotypes formed a monophyletic
group relative to the outgroup taxa (Figure 1). According
to our definition as least inclusive terminal clades with
bootstrap support of 90% or more, we could infer five
Molecularly defined Operational Taxonomic Units
(MOTU1-5) within Radix. They comprised all haplotypes
except two from North Poland (Table 1). These two haplotypes grouped with the species R. relicta and R. pinteri
from Lake Ohrid/Prespa, however, with weak support. For
convenience, we refer to the latter group as Clade 6 (Figure 1). The geographic distribution of most MOTU covered the entire range investigated. Only MOTU3 seems to
be restricted to the South-West of France and MOTU5 is
absent from the Northern parts of the area searched (Figure 2). The average sequence divergence between MOTU
ranged from 5% to over 17%, while the sequence diversity
within MOTU did not exceed 3% (Table 2). At each sampling site, only haplotypes from a single MOTU were
found. For subsequent analyses, we therefore presumed
all individuals from the same sampling site to belong to
the same MOTU.
ITS-1 variation
The ITS-1 sequence variation from the geographically
restricted subset sampled in Switzerland revealed three
distinct clades with high bootstrap support. These clades
were congruent with the MOTU inferred for the respective
animals based on COI (Figure 3).
Crossing experiments
In 4 of the 36 pairings, one or both snails died before
reaching sexual maturity. None of the snails kept alone
reproduced. MOTU delineation has shown that population GGK and GVD belonged both to MOTU2 and population OUR to MOTU4. All crosses between individuals
from the same population yielded viable offspring. All
pairings among individuals of the MOTU2 populations
(GGK and GVD) were also fertile. However, not a single
egg mass was produced in crosses among individuals
belonging to different MOTU (OUR snails paired with
either GGK or GVD individuals).

Morphometric analysis
The shell shapes of 837 individuals from the field were
analysed. PCA extracted two meaningful axes (eigenvalues
larger than expected from a broken stick model), representing 25.5% and 17.6% of the total morphometric variance, respectively. The first axis ordinated the shells in a
gradient from elongated, slim shape with erect whorls
towering over a narrow aperture (negative scores) to a
globular shape with barely extruded whorls and a wide
aperture larger than the rest of the shell (positive scores).
The second axis opposed shells with slightly elevated
whorls and wide aperture whose upper rim extends

almost in a right angle on the positive side and shells with
narrower apertures and immediately descending upper
rim on the negative side. Apart from a slightly offset population (KBW) in the lower right quadrant, the morphospace described by these gradients is continuously filled,
with most of the specimen positioned in an ellipse from
the lower left to the upper right quadrant (Figure 4).
All MOTU occupied a large area of the common morphospace. While MOTU1 and MOTU4 shells were predominantly found to have rather large apertures, the opposite
is true for MOTU5. MOTU3 shells figure in the centre of

the cloud. MOTU2 individuals were placed everywhere,
including the somewhat aberrant KBW population. The
morphospace of each MOTU overlaps with all other
MOTU (Figure 4). Consequently, a discriminant analysis
with MOTU as grouping factor resulted in a poor posterior
classification success of less than 50% (details not
shown).
Influence of habitat structure on shell shape
NPCA on categorical habitat structure variables retained
two meaningful axes, summarising 32.2% and 25.5% of
total variance. The first axes opposed shallow, temporal
water bodies on the negative side and deep, permanent
habitats on the positive side. This axis was significantly
correlated to the average population scores on Morph
PCA2 (r = 0.514, p = 0.002). The second axis delineates a
gradient from stagnant waters with muddy substrate to
running streams and hard underground. A significant correlation existed between this axis and the average population scores on Morph PCA1 (r = 0.435, p = 0.011).
Indicating the MOTU affiliation on the plot of these correlations reveals that MOTU4 occurs preferentially in
deep, permanent waters (Figure 5). Otherwise, little structure in the habitat preferences of the MOTU can be
detected. This finding is supported by a discriminant analysis with population MOTU as predictor on the habitat
structure variables that, albeit being significant, resulted
in a poor posterior classification success rate of less than
50% (details not shown).

Phenotypic plasticity
Rearing populations from three different MOTU (2, 4,
and 5) for one or two generations in the laboratory
revealed the sensitivity of the developing shell shape to
the experienced environmental conditions. In four out of
five populations, the average shell shape became narrower, in two cases significantly. One population changed
in the opposite direction, but not significantly (Figure 6).
Similar, though not significant tendencies toward narrower shells were also observed along the second axes
(data not shown).

Discussion
MOTU inference and species delimitation in Radix
Despite several attempts to characterise Radix and other
Lymnaeidae species with molecular markers [17-19], this
is the first study based on a substantial number of populations and individuals [5]. The monophyly inferred for
all presumed Radix individuals in this (Figure 1) and other
analyses [17,19] suggests that the European species of this
genus form a natural taxon. All but two haplotypes were
unanimously included in five MOTU according to the definition used. The DNA-taxonomy approach thus succeeded in finding internally homogeneous, recognisable
groups of individuals. Following the tree based species
delimitation approach of Wiens and Penkrot [6], the lack
of apparent gene-flow between populations of different
well supported basal lineages strongly indicates the existence of multiple species. The two ungrouped haplotypes

from Poland are most similar to those derived from the
described species R. relicta and R. pinteri. Intensified sampling in Eastern Europe would be necessary to determine
their mutual relation and their distinctness from the lake
Ohrid/Prespa species.
Conservatively assuming an exceptionally fast molecular
clock rate, the sequence divergence of 5% among the most
similar MOTU2 and 3 suggested that these lineages
diverged at least 1 million years ago (Table 2). Such fast
rates were suspected for land snails [20], but it is yet
unclear whether they apply also for freshwater gastropods.
Sequence divergence estimates using more conventional
mutation rates of 1.5–2% implied divergence in the
Pliocene. Such an ancient divergence among haplotype
lineages is usually an indication for longstanding reproductive isolation [21]. The minimum divergence among
MOTU exceeded the maximum divergence of 2.9% within
MOTU.

Four of the six inferred clades have broad and overlapping
geographical ranges (Figure 2). In this regard, Radix differs
from the freshwater Basommatophora Ancylus, in which
the inferred cryptic species are confined to specific areas
[22]. Given the restricted sampling area and -density, it
seems therefore possible that i) some clades like e.g.
MOTU3 are actually more widespread and ii) additional
clades may exist throughout the distribution range of the
genus. Despite often close geographic co-occurrence of
different MOTU, we never found two MOTU at the same
site. Even though only few individuals were sequenced per
site, the joint occurrence of more than one MOTU at a single site seems to be a quite uncommon phenomenon. Differences in micro distribution of two Radix lineages in the
same mountain lake were also found by Ward et al. [23].
This might be due to either different microhabitat preferences, mutual competitive exclusion, rare dispersal events
that render multiple colonisations of the same site
improbable or – the combination of latter two – monop-

olisation of the site by the species accidentally arrived first
[24].
Shared mitochondrial haplotypes of the same MOTU
among often geographically widely separated sampling
sites suggested either recurrent gene-flow among populations or their recent common origin [25]. In order to test
whether gene-flow among MOTU exists, we have surveyed
the nuclear ITS-1 locus on a regional scale in Switzerland,
because three of the inferred MOTU (1, 2, and 5) coexist
there in close proximity. Nuclear gene-flow, as evidenced
by shared haplotypes, seemed to occur only among populations of the same MOTU, but not among different lineages (Figure 3). The reciprocal monophyly and
congruence of mitochondrial and nuclear loci despite the
possibility to interbreed strongly suggested long lasting
reproductive isolation among the lineages. Even though
occasional hybridisation can not be categorically excluded
based on our data, they seem to be rare events.
These results were corroborated by the crossing experiments among populations of MOTU2 and 4. The complete lack of interbreeding among lineages observed here
is consistent with the findings of Wullschleger and Jokela
[13]. The lack of offspring produced by snails kept in solitude, does not preclude selfing in the presence of mates
or variation among the potential for selfing among different populations [26,27]. Taken all evidence together, the
results strongly indicate that the MOTU inferred with COI
represent reproductively isolated entities and can therefore be regarded as biological species [2].
Shell characters are unsuitable to delimit biological
entities in Radix
The main shell shape gradients extracted from morphometric data correspond to the shell characters used in the
taxonomic literature and keys to distinguish among Radix
species [11,28]. For example, R. labiata is presumed to differ from all other Radix by a descending upper aperture
rim and a slightly inflated last whorl [11]. Such shells can
be found in the lower left quadrant of the plot in Figure 4.
However, there is a continuous transition between this
form and other shell shapes, making it impossible to
delimit a morphological entity on the given descriptive
criteria. The same is true for all other described species
(Figure 4). Therefore, any attempt to find discrete, consistent groups based on shell shape differences is obviously
bound to fail, let alone to delimit or identify biological
species on the basis of these characters [1,6]. The absence
of discrete, homogenous groups based on shell shape
showed the unsuitability of these characters for taxonomic purposes in Radix. Moreover, the shell variability of
the inferred MOTU overlaps to a large extent and is therefore also unsuitable to identify the evolutionary lineages.
The failure to find consistent morphological groups and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/100

the large mutual overlap in morphospace of evolutionary
lineages made it difficult to match the inferred MOTU to
described taxonomical entities. One reasonable procedure
for such a venture could be to sequence individuals from
the type location. There are, however, two major obstacles
for this proceeding. First, the type locations are often
poorly defined. For example, in the description of R. auricularia by Linné in 1758, it is stated that the species "lives
in Europe". Given that different species may occur in close
proximity (e.g. HER, BOD), even quite precise information may be misleading. Second, the habitat of most Radix
species is more or less ephemeral. It is therefore questionable whether the present day populations are identical
with the described ones several hundred years ago. Consequently, the designation of neotypes, including molecular
information and/or tissue deposition appears to be the
only feasible strategy to establish the taxonomy of the
genus. However, a formal taxonomic revision of the genus
was not the aim of the study.
Influence of the environment on shell shape variation in
Radix
The environment proved to covary significantly with the
shell shape, even though taken rather crudely into account
in terms of descriptive habitat structure characteristics.
The evolutionary lineage on the other hand had no detectable impact on shell shape, suggesting that the observed
variation within Radix lineages is little restrained by their
phylogenetic history. Because causal relations were not
investigated, we cannot say whether the habitat structure
has a direct influence on the shell shape or whether covarying factors not taken into account affect the shell development (Figure 5). This raises the suspicion that the
reported covariation of differences in the soft body anatomy with shell shape [11] may be also under environmental control and therefore not suited for species
delimitation. Further investigations would be necessary to
match anatomical differences with species boundaries.

Narrow shells seemed to prevail in temporal, shallow,
stagnant waters with soft substrate, while the shells with
large apertures were preferentially found in deep, permanent, or running waters on hard surfaces (Figure 5). Large
apertures might thus reflect adaptations to predation pressure and/or water current by offering a larger adherence
surface for the snail's foot. A phenotypic reaction to particular environmental conditions might also be the reason
for the outstanding shell shape of the KBW population,
belong otherwise to MOTU2 (Figure 4). The sampling site
in a little stream carried an extraordinary load of iron
oxide, as evidenced by a typical red precipitate.
The question remained whether the occurrence of similar
shell traits in all lineages is due to adaptation to local
selection pressures or developmental plasticity in

Page 10 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:100

response to environmental conditions (which may be
itself under natural selection) common to all Radix species. Multiple independent similar adaptations to local
selection pressures have been demonstrated for several
limnic organisms [29,30]. The fast transition within one
generation towards narrower shells under laboratory conditions without water current and predation, however,
argues rather for phenotypic plasticity of the shell during
growth (Figure 6). A similar change in shell morphology
was also observed in a study by Wullschleger and Jokela
[31]. Phenotypic response to an unrecorded change in
environmental conditions might therefore be a plausible
alternative explanation to competitive replacement for the
observed transition of narrow shaped shells (identified as
R. peregra) by broad shaped shells (termed R. auricularia)
in the field within a single year by Adam and Lewis [32].

Conclusion
We conclude that the taxonomic distinction of species in
the genus Radix cannot be based on shell morphology,
because the variability is i) continuous, ii) largely overlapping among biological species and iii) phenotypically
plastic in response to environmental conditions, as previously suspected [31]. This means that species identifications based on shell morphology have probably not
resulted in reliable data. As most species designations of
Radix in scientific collections, ecological studies or environmental monitoring are based on exactly these characters, results from such studies must be treated with
caution. This situation would be embarrassing, but not
very serious, if only this particular freshwater gastropod
genus would be affected. However, an increasing number
of studies e.g. [33-39] have shown that cryptic species or
overlapping variability is a quite common phenomenon
in invertebrates. Insufficient morphological differentiation among invertebrate species is therefore likely to be
taxonomically widespread, resulting in dubious if not
outright wrong species identifications and delimitations.
In many cases, such misidentifications probably lead to
questionable scientific inferences. This situation is likely
to be even more severe, since the majority of taxonomic
identifications are not made by systematic specialists of
the respective taxa, but by researchers interested primarily
in other issues [40].
On the other hand, the DNA-taxonomy based on the
sequence divergence of short mitochondrial sequences
recognised entities that fulfilled the desirable criteria of
recognisability and internal homogeneity on the basis of
an objective and explicit heuristic [1]. The recognised entities also coincided with biological species, as shown by
other lines of evidence. Apart from the manifold practical
assets of these approaches, reviewed thoroughly elsewhere [4,41,42], the greatest conceptional advantage of
DNA-taxonomy over morphological methods lies in the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/100

direct inheritance of the characters used for identification.
Unlike many morphological characters, DNA-sequences
do not underlie potentially misleading developmental or
environmental modifications. Another advantage of this
approach is that the evolutionary entities can later be unequivocally re-identified by their COI sequence [43],
regardless whether or not the inferred species could be
matched to a contemporarily recognised species,
belonged to yet undescribed lineages or will be the "victim" of a future taxonomic revision. Moreover, as the
DNA sequences and associated digital shell pictures are
deposited in Internet based repositories, they are available
for further studies, a highly desirable feature of taxonomical data [44,45]. Even an automated MOTU delineation
and species re-identification at large scale seems therefore
imaginable in the near future [46]. We recognise, however, the danger that also DNA-taxonomy may fail to
resolve recently diverged taxa, especially if the species
have ancestrally polymorphic mitochondrial haplotypes
that do not sort according to subsequent speciation events
[47].
The need for reliable species-level identification is contentious [40,48] and DNA-taxonomy and -barcoding could
provide it when taxonomic discrimination at this level is
warranted. It could also ensure uniform quality of results
in studies where the quality of taxonomic data might be
compromised by differing taxonomic profusions or opinions among researchers involved. In a way, DNA-taxonomy can make species based research independent of the
imponderabilities of present and future taxonomical
developments and could keep species based studies comparable over space and time.

Methods
Sampling
Radix snails were sampled from 60 sites at 57 locations
throughout Europe, with emphasis on France, Switzerland, Germany and Poland. At each site, snails were sampled from at maximum 1 m shoreline, the distance
between sites at the same location being at least 25 m.
Snails were fixed immediately upon sampling in 80% ethanol, and except for those destined for breeding and crossing experiments. The latter were transported in aerated
beakers to the laboratory.
DNA isolation, COI sequencing and MOTU identification
The extracted soft body of the snails was crushed and vortexed in 10% w/v laundry detergent solution for storage at
room temperature and tissue digestion [49]. DNA was
extracted following the protocol of Winnepenninckx et al.
[50]. For 169 individuals, a 512 bp segment of the cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COI) was amplified with
PCR and sequenced. For a subset of individuals (see
below), the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS-1) from the

Page 11 of 14

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:100

nuclear ribosomal cluster was additionally amplified and
sequenced. An amount of 0.2 to 1 ng total DNA was used
as template in polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Specific
PCRs were performed with the primers, amplification
conditions and temperature profiles shown in [39]. Primers were used for both specific PCR and subsequential
automated direct sequencing. PCR products were purified
using E.N.Z.A. Cycle Pure Kit (peqlab, Erlangen, Germany) PureLink PCR Purification Kit (Invitrogen, USA).
Ten ng per sample were subjected to cycle sequencing
using the CEQ DTCS Quick Start Kit (Beckman Coulter,
USA). Sequences were analysed on a CEQ 2000 automated DNA Sequencer, Beckman Coulter. In order to verify the results, gene products were sequenced in both
directions and the two strands were aligned with
SEQUENCE NAVIGATOR 1.0.1 (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk,
CT, USA). Sequences were deposited in GenBank under
accession numbers DQ980030–DQ980193. Digital pictures of the shells together with specimen information for
most of the sequenced individuals were deposited in the
Barcoding of Life Database (MPRAD1-06 – MPRAD13906). The orthologous DNA sequences were initially
aligned using the default settings of CLUSTALW [51] and
optimised by eye. The sequences were collapsed to haplotypes prior to phylogenetic analysis. Additionally, COI
sequences were obtained from the non-focus species
Radix relicta (ancient lake Ohrid, Albania) and R. pinteri
(Lake Prespa, Macedonia), as well as from several other
Basommatophora species that served as outgroup. We
used the COI data set to infer MOTU, relying on sequence
divergence. To this end, the most likely model of sequence
evolution and its parameters according to the Akaike
information criterion were inferred for the COI dataset
using MODELTEST v. 3.6 [52]. The chosen model
(GTR+I+Γ) was then used to compute pairwise sequence
divergence estimates between all individuals. To visualise
the results, an unrooted neighbour-joining (NJ) phenogram was constructed based on the pairwise ML-distance
matrix with PAUP 4.10 b [53]. Support of nodes by the
data was estimated using the bootstrap [54]. Molecular
Defined Operational Taxonomic Units (MOTU) [55,56],
were then defined as least inclusive terminal groups with
90% bootstrap support or more, using 1000 bootstrap
replicates. This follows the general definition of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTU) as groups of organisms
used in a taxonomic study without designation of taxonomic rank. Just as OTU in traditional taxonomy, MOTU
do not necessarily equate to biological species, but should
be treated as taxonomical hypotheses in need for additional evidence of their mutual reproductive isolation [1].
Test for congruence among in mitochondrial and nuclear
loci
To test for congruence in MOTU inference from mitochondrial and nuclear loci, the sequence variation on the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/100

ITS-1 locus of a subset of 27 individuals from neighbouring populations in Switzerland (Table 1) was analysed.
These populations were chosen, because three MOTU
occurred there in close geographical proximity, allowing
potentially gene-flow among these sites. Of the approximately 590 bp fragment amplified, only 217 bp could be
unambiguously read, which yielded 47 informative sites.
The initial inspection of the sequence alignment revealed
that saturation was not an issue, but gaps were likely to be
informative. Therefore, parsimony with gaps treated as
fifth state was chosen as a means to reconstruct the gene
tree, using PAUP 4.10 b [53]. The support of the resulting
phylogeny by the data was assessed using the bootstrap
[54].
Crossing experiments
Fifteen to twenty individuals from three populations
(GGK, GVD, OUR) were reared until reproduction in the
laboratory in different 10 l aquaria in aged tap water at
18–20°C under a 16/8 light/dark regime with food ad libitum consisting of boiled lettuce and commercial fish food.
Snails from the next generation were isolated before they
reached sexual maturity (shell length smaller than 5 mm)
and paired with a single other snail in a smaller vessel (1
l) under the same conditions as described above. Pairings
were carried out with six replicates for each possible interand intra population combination, resulting in a total of
36 attempted crossings. To control for possible self-fertilisation in these hermaphroditic snails, six individuals from
each population were raised alone. Only from these three
populations, a sufficient number of laboratory reared
individuals with known genetic origin was available.
Morphometric analysis
To assess the shell shape of Radix in a repeatable, objective
fashion, we used morphometric techniques. Only shells
from adult individuals were considered. Shells were
placed (with the aperture down) on the glass plate of a
scanner and imaged against a black background with a
resolution of 300 dpi to greyscale pictures. Resulting
images were edited for improved contrast and then transformed to black/white images. The program tpsDIG [57]
was used to apply 150 equidistantly spaced points on the
shell outline. These points were used to produce a closed
outline curve. The shape of the shells was quantified by
elliptic Fourier approximation as described by [58]. This
technique consists of decomposing a closed contour curve
in a two-dimensional plane into a sum of harmonically
related sequences. Fourier decompositions are sensitive to
location, size and orientation of objects. We consequently
used the longitudinal axis of the shells to rotate them into
the same orientation. The images were then centred and
normalised for size. The decomposition into Fourier series
was computed with EFAWin [59], using the algorithms of
[60]. The application of 10 harmonics was sufficient to

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:100

reproduce the outline with high accuracy. As the first three
coefficients are trivial, this resulted in 37 Fourier variables.
These variables were summarised in a Principal Component Analysis. For correlation analyses with habitat characteristics, the population means of the individual
Principal Component scores were computed.
Assessment of habitat characteristics
To characterise the habitat, the following categorical variables of 35 Radix populations (Table 1) visited during
sampling were recorded: altitude class (below/above 1000
m), current (stagnant/slow/fast), depth (less/more than 1
m), permanency (ephemeral/permanent), macrophytes
(present/absent) and sediment size (mud/sand/hard). We
used Nonlinear Principal Component Analysis (NPCA) to
summarise habitat score variables of these habitat structure characteristics. NPCA was developed for the analysis
of rankable categorical data and can be used in a similar
fashion as standard PCA.

Shell shape variation among laboratory bred generations
Individuals from five populations (GGK, GVD, OUR,
HON, STR) were bred separately in the laboratory for one
or two generations (two populations reproduced faster)
under the conditions mentioned above. Only individuals
from these populations could be brought alive in sufficient number into the laboratory. The shells of the
deceased adults in each generation were removed from
the basin and measured morphometrically as described
above. Unfortunately, the shells of the first laboratory
generation of GVD were accidentally discarded and could
not be analysed.
