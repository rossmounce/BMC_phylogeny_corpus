Abstract
This review gives an overview of different yeast strains and enzyme classes involved in yeast wholecell biotransformations. A focus was put on the synthesis of compounds for fine chemical and API
(= active pharmaceutical ingredient) production employing single or only few-step enzymatic
reactions. Accounting for recent success stories in metabolic engineering, the construction and use
of synthetic pathways was also highlighted. Examples from academia and industry and advances in
the field of designed yeast strain construction demonstrate the broad significance of yeast whole-cell
applications. In addition to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, alternative yeast whole-cell biocatalysts are discussed
such as Candida sp., Cryptococcus sp., Geotrichum sp., Issatchenkia sp., Kloeckera sp., Kluyveromyces sp.,
Pichia sp. (including Hansenula polymorpha = P. angusta), Rhodotorula sp., Rhodosporidium sp., alternative
Saccharomyces sp., Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Torulopsis sp., Trichosporon sp., Trigonopsis variabilis,
Yarrowia lipolytica and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii.

Background
The advent of yeast whole-cell biocatalysis coincided with
the development of first technologies for the human
society. Some thousand years BC, when organized
agriculture had appeared, the development of yeast-based
technology started. Today, artistic records (e.g. in tombs of
wealthier members of the ancient Egyptian society) and
archaeological data provide an insight into the daily life in
ancient Egypt [1,2] and teach us that bread and also beer
were central parts of the Egyptian’s diet [3]. However, no
more than approximately 200 years ago, leading scientists
recognized yeasts as the cause of fermentation and started
to examine them because of their economic importance
and one morphologic advantage compared to some other
microorganisms, their large cells [4]. Understanding the
scientific basis for alcoholic fermentation was financially
well supported by the alcoholic fermentation industries
and governments at that time. Basically, research on yeasts

greatly contributed to the development of microbiology,
biochemistry and also biocatalysis. Berthelot’s and Emil
Fischer’s research results on the utilization of different
sugars by yeasts were central to studies on enzymes and
their specificity. Especially Fischer’s lock and key model
published in 1894 [5] provided the basis for subsequent
concepts. These include for example the theory about the
enzyme-substrate complex developed by Henri [6] and
Michaelis & Menten [7], respectively, Haldane’s concept of
substrate activation representing the idea of selective
binding energy which leads either to transition state
stabilization or substrate destabilization [8], and the
induced fit theory described by Koshland [9,10]. Early
yeast research, which was comprehensively reviewed by
Barnett [4], also contributed to basic biochemical knowledge including the understanding of metabolic pathways,
Monod’s concepts of enzyme induction[11] and basic
findings on cell cycles [12,13].

Most of this early research was based on Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and therefore, the term ‘yeast’ was and is often
taken as a synonym for S. cerevisiae. However, yeasts
belong to a group of eukaryotic microorganisms,
predominantly unicellular and phylogenetically quite
diverse [14]. They are assigned to two taxonomic classes
of fungi, the ascomycetes and the basidiomycetes
[14,15]. Their classification is mostly based on phenotypic characters such as morphology, the ability to utilize
various exogenous compounds and modes of vegetative
reproduction, namely budding or fission. Some yeasts
also form sexual states which differ from those of other
fungi as they are not enclosed in fruiting bodies [15]. At
the end of the 20th century molecular methods have
become increasingly popular in order to estimate genetic
relation among yeasts. Recently, Hibbett et al. [16]
attempted to create a consensus higher-level classification for the Fungi for general use. This broad-based
consensus classification was necessary in order to
prevent confusion and loss of information as caused by
repetitive renaming of several yeast strains in the past
[17]. An overview of yeast genera was provided by
Walker [18] or Boekhout and Kurtzman [15,19], for
example. A comprehensive phylogenetic relationship
among sequenced fungal genomes, including more
than 20 yeast genomes, was recently depicted by
Scannell et al. [20].
Although yeasts, especially Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have
been employed in synthetic organic chemistry since the
beginning of the 20th century [21-23], scientists devoted
to classical organic chemistry often hesitated to consider
biological systems for their synthetic problems [24]. In
the 1970s, biocatalysis started booming and up to now
the number of publications on biotransformations has
been rising exponentially. Remarkable findings led to a
better understanding of biological systems and consequently to their increased application for chemical
conversions, especially in the field of organic synthesis
[25].
In general, two major synthetic technologies based on
biocatalytic reactions were described, namely ‘fermentation’ and ‘enzymation’ (alternative names for ‘enzymation’: ‘microbial transformation’, ‘microbial conversion’,
‘biotransformation’, ‘bioconversion’) [24,25]. Fermentation was considered to be a biological method resulting
in products which are the result of the complex
metabolism of microorganisms starting with inexpensive
simple carbon and nitrogen sources. As a consequence,
living or even growing cells were a prerequisite for this
technology and fermentation was regarded to always
result in natural products [25]. On the other hand,
enzymation was specified not to necessarily require
living cells, as cells were only important for the enzyme’s

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/25

production and were themselves regarded as ‘simple bag
of enzymes or catalysts’ [25]. Furthermore, enzymation
was described to be a one or few-step conversion of a
more complex substrate into a product [24,25]. However, Yamada and Shimizu [25] already stated that it was
not always possible to clearly distinguish between the
two categories.
In recent years, the way for the generation of designed
microorganisms was paved by an increasing number of
sequenced genes and even whole genomes, new bioinformatic tools providing the basis for analyzing this
wealth of information, biochemically well-characterized
biosynthetic pathways and well-established and facile
genetic engineering techniques. These approaches
include for example, the construction of synthetic
pathways for the production of structurally complex,
natural products like isoprenoids or polyketides and
novel variations thereof. Furthermore, even minimum
genome factories could enter the field of biocatalysis in
future. Currently, first examples of such cell factories are
created in which unnecessary or harmful genes are
deleted and only genes necessary for industrial production are present [26]. For this approach, up to now, three
species were selected, namely two bacteria (Escherichia
coli [27] and Bacillus subtilis [28]), and the fission yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe [29]. With these developments
in mind, one has to admit that the idea of whole-cell
biocatalysts being ‘black boxes’ already started to fade.
The following chapters will now give an overview of
different yeast strains and enzyme classes involved in
yeast whole-cell biocatalysis. We will provide examples
from academia and industry and especially focus on
recent advances in the field of designed yeast strains for
whole-cell biocatalytic applications. Thereby, we will
also include synthetic pathways to structurally complex
compounds, a methodology which lies in between
classical ‘fermentation’ and ‘enzymation’. Thus, we will
include both, one- and multi-step enzymatic reactions in
a native or engineered environment, starting with simple
or complex substrate molecules.

Review
1. Chemical reactions catalyzed by wild-type
yeast whole-cell biocatalysts
Especially baker’s yeast (= Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was
regarded to be ideal for chemists looking for a stereoselective biocatalyst, which should eventually lead to
chiral intermediates in the synthesis of enantiomerically
pure compounds [30]. It is nonpathogenic, inexpensive,
simple to grow at laboratory and large scale and the cells
can be stored indefinitely in dried form [24]. For
chemical synthesis, however, the chemical repertoire of

Microbial Cell Factories 2008, 7:25

yeast whole-cell biocatalysts is of major importance. In
the following, an overview is given, outlining the main
enzymatic reactions performed by wild-type yeast
strains, and positive and negative aspects of these
whole-cell biocatalysts are discussed.

1.1 Reduction of C=O-bonds
The asymmetric reduction of carbonyl-containing compounds by yeast, in particular Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
depicts probably the most thoroughly investigated class
of whole-cell biotransformations. One of the first reports
on this topic was the reduction of furfural to furfuryl
alcohol by Windisch [31] and Lintner [32] at the
beginning of the 20th century. The first comprehensive
overview of reduction reactions catalyzed by yeast was
published in 1949 [33]. Since that time, many different
substrates containing carbonyl moieties were subjected
to yeast bioreduction and the most important achievements were summarized in reviews and book chapters,
partly focusing on Saccharomyces cerevisiae [30,34,35] but
also on biocatalysts in general, including alternative
yeasts [24,25,36-43]. The investigated substrate spectrum
is huge, including a variety of functional groups as
substituents of the ketone moiety (for example heterocyclic-, hydroxyl-, sulfur-, cyano-, and azido-groups, or
different halogenides) and even derivatives such as silylor germyl-groups were found to be accepted [24].
Generally, Saccharomyces cerevisiae reduces simple aliphatic and aromatic ketones according to Prelog’s rule
[44] resulting in the corresponding (S)-alcohols [45]
(Figure 1). However, this should not always be generalized and caution should be exercised in particular, when
Prelog’s rule is applied to whole cells [34].

A major advantage of whole-cell (redox)-biocatalysts is
the availability of all the necessary cofactors and
metabolic pathways for their regeneration. Furthermore,

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/25

cheap carbon sources (e.g. glucose, saccharose) can be
employed as auxiliary substrates. Finally, the actual
biocatalyst and cofactors are well protected within their
natural cellular environment which makes the catalytic
system more stable [24]. However, employing wild-type
yeast strains as whole-cell biocatalysts also includes
distinct drawbacks: Most of the interesting substrates are
non-natural and toxic to living organisms. Therefore,
they must be used in diluted systems at low concentrations (mostly ≤ 0.3% per volume) [24,46]. Only small
fractions of the auxiliary substrate are used for cofactor
recycling, the majority is metabolized. This results in
large amounts of biomass and by-products which
impede product recovery tremendously, especially if
the product is not secreted to the reaction medium.
Transport phenomena into and out of the cell could be
encountered which may even influence specificity
[24,46]. Eventually, comparable results are only possible
if exactly the same culture is used for repetitive
biotransformations since different strains of the same
microorganism could have different specificities [24,46].
Another major limitation of wild-type yeast strains is the
presence of a large number of different dehydrogenases
with overlapping substrate specificities but opposite
stereoselectivities [47]. The elucidation of the complete
genome sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [48,49]
finally made scientists aware of the huge variety of
available oxidoreductases. Earlier, empirical findings
helped to develop methods to improve the selectivity
of yeast whole-cell biotransformations. These techniques
included substrate modification [50], changes in cultivation conditions or the application of different carbon
sources [51], the use of inhibitors [52] or the use of twophase systems [53,54]. Recently, also water immiscible
ionic liquids were used as biocompatible solvents for
yeast whole-cell biocatalysis in order to provide a
substrate reservoir and an in situ extracting agent to
increase chemical yields [55].

If these techniques were not successful, alternative
microorganisms had to be screened. In addition to
Saccharomyces cerevisiae also alternative yeasts were found
which provided valuable biocatalysts for asymmetric
carbonyl reduction. Some were efficient enough to be
employed for industrial applications by different companies (Table 2 and Additional File 2, Section 2).
Some recent advances in the biocatalytic reduction of
carbonyl-containing compounds are summarized in
Table 1 (Additional file 1) and include for example the
finding of new activities for Yarrowia lipolytica [56]. Lagos
et al. [56] screened different yeast strains for the
enantioselective production of a halohydrin precursor
for (S)-propranolol synthesis. Yarrowia lipolytica 1240
(Spanish type culture collection CECT, Valencia) resting
cells gave the ‘anti-Prelog’-enantiomer (S)-1-chloro-3-(1naphthyloxy)propan-2-ol with 87% yield and 99% ee. In
addition, Pichia mexicana 11015 (CECT, Valencia) resting
cells were found to give 85% yield and 95% ee for the
(R)-enantiomer. Dehli and Gotor [57] discovered that
resting cells of Saccharomyces montanus CBS 6772
performed the bioreduction of 2-oxo cyclopentane
carbonitriles to the corresponding cis-hydroxynitriles in
93% ee, and high de and chemical yields.
As cheap alternative, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is still quite
often used for laboratory-scale bioreductions. Enders
et al. [58] described the efficient asymmetric total
synthesis of (-)-callystatin A, a potent cytotoxic polyketide from a marine sponge, employing a combination of
chemical and biocatalytic methods. Therefore, tert-butyl
6-chloro-3,5-dioxohexanoate was subjected to dried
baker’s yeast in a biphasic system (water/XAD-7 adsorber
resin) and was regio- and enantioselectively reduced to
the (5R)-hydroxy keto ester in 94% enantiomeric excess
[58]. Furthermore, Bertau and Burli [59] reported the
application of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells for the
synthesis of (2S,5S)-hexanediol. Glucose was used as
auxiliary substrate for cofactor regeneration and with
25 mmol of hexanedione as substrate complete conversion with > 99% ee, 96% de and 75% yield was achieved.
Servi and coworkers [60] showed that whole cells of
Geotrichum candidum CBS 233.76 (95% yield, > 98% ee;
4 g/L, with absorbing resin Amberlite XAD-1180) and
Rhodotorula mucillaginosa CBS 2378 (88% yield, > 99%
ee; 1 g/L) reduced 3,4-dichlorophenacyl chloride to the
(S)- and (R)-alcohol, respectively.
Matsuyama et al. [61] screened several yeast strains for
the large scale production of (R)-1,3-butanediol, as the
productivity of already reported asymmetric microbial
reduction processes (for example with S. cerevisiae) was
not satisfactory. Starting with 4-hydroxy-2-butanone,
Candida arborea IAM 4147 and Issatchenkia scutulata IFO

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/25

10070 showed excellent ee (99%) but low yield, whereas
Kluyveromyces lactis IFO 1267 gave high yield and good
enantiomeric excess (93%) for (R)-1,3-butanediol. In
contrast, Candida parapsilosis IFO 1396 performed the
best for (S)-1,3-butanediol production (98% ee, 60%
yield). In recent times, a new yeast isolate, namely
Candida tropicalis PBR-2 MTCC 5158 was reported to
enantioselectively reduce acetophenone and several
substituted analogues to the corresponding (S)-alcohols
with an enantiomeric excess of > 97%, mostly even >
99% [62]. As the natural aroma compounds 2-phenylethanol (2-PE) and 2-phenylethylacetate (2-PEAc) are of
high industrial value, Etschmann and Schrader [63]
lately improved their production by employing Kluyveromyces marxianus CBS 600 for a growth-associated
product formation starting with L-phenylalanine. 26.5
g LÀ1 2-PE and 6.1 g LÀ1 2-PEAc were obtained in the
organic phase which consisted of polypropylene glycol
1200, used as in situ extractant. This corresponded to
space-time yields of 0.33 (2-PE) and 0.08 g LÀ1 hÀ1
(2-PEAc) surpassing the results of a previously reported
S. cerevisiae process (Table 1; Additional File 1) [64].
Finally, Nakamura et al. [41] reviewed the use of
Geotrichum candidum whole-cell preparations for the
synthesis of chiral secondary alcohols with high enantioselectivities (up to > 99% ee).
In addition to these and also future findings in the field
of selective yeast carbonyl-bioreductions, a strong trend
for the construction of so-called ‘designer-bugs’ namely
whole-cell biocatalysts co-expressing all required
enzymes can be observed [65]. Most often E. coli is
employed as recombinant host [66-69] due to the wealth
of oxidoreductases found in yeasts, in particular, in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Nowadays, the increasing number of annotated DNA sequences helps to identify
enzymes involved in bioreductions and provides the
information needed for the rational design of recombinant whole-cell biocatalysts [47].

1.2 Reduction of C=C-bonds
In 1933, the first flavin-dependent redox enzyme was
discovered in Brewer’s bottom yeast by Warburg and
Christian [70]. Enzymes of this family are also known as
‘old yellow enzymes’ because of their color derived from
the flavin cofactor. Typical substrates [24,71] are alkenes
which are ‘activated’ by electron-withdrawing substituents. Such substrates are reduced at the expense of NAD
(P)H leading to enantiomerically pure alkanes. Thereby
up to two chiral carbon centers are created (Figure 2).

In the past, most asymmetric bioreductions of activated
C=C bonds employing enoate reductases were performed with whole cells, since problems with external

Enoate reductases perform the NAD(P)H-dependent,
asymmetric bioreduction of activated C=C bonds.
A cofactor recycling system is required for an economic
process. Asterisks (*) indicate chiral centers, X depicts an
activating group such as carbonyl-, carboxyl-, imide- or
nitro-group [24,71].

cofactor recycling and the enzyme’s sensitivity to traces
of oxygen were encountered [24,72]. With whole-cell
bioreductions often excellent stereoselectivities were
achieved. However, chemoselectivity is often poor,
regarding especially competitive C=C- and C=O-bond
reductions. Whole-cells do not only provide enoate
reductases but also alcohol dehydrogenases which both
depend on the same nicotinamide cofactor. Uncoupling
is hardly possible and the relative rates of alcohol
dehydrogenases are comparable to those of enoate
reductases leading to undesired by-products [71]. Nevertheless, successful examples for asymmetric bioreductions of a,b-unsaturated ketones exist, for example, with
S. cerevisiae cells: Careful reaction control during
oxoisophorone bioreduction led to the main product
((R)-2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexane-1,4-dione) in > 80%
yield. The unwanted by-products were kept to a
minimum. The product – also known as (R)-levodione –
was produced on a 13 kg-scale [73]. It is industrially used
for 3-hydroxycarotenoid production [74] (Table 2 and
Additional File 2).
In general, the most prominent whole-cell biocatalyst
employed was again baker’s yeast (S. cerevisiae) which
was tested with a great variety of differently substituted
alkene substrates, such as e.g. different a,b-unsaturated
nitroalkenes. It tolerated many different functional
groups like alkyls and (substituted) aryls attached to
the nitroalkene moiety [75,76]. However, also alternative yeasts were described to be active. Geotrichum
candidum [77], Rhodotorula rubra [78] and Rhodosporidium
sp. [78] were found to possess enoate reductases, active
for diverse non-natural a,b-unsaturated carbonyl- and
carboxyl-compounds, respectively [71]. Candida sp.,
Rhodotorula sp. and Torulopsis sp. were also shown to be
active on a,b-unsaturated nitroalkenes [79]. Currently,

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/25

the use of isolated enzymes or the construction of
‘designer bugs’ provides the possibility to reduce side
reactions significantly. Desired yeast enoate reductases
(e.g. from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [80], Saccharomyces
carlsbergensis [81] or Candida macedoniensis [82]) were
recently cloned and overexpressed in E. coli. Kataoka
et al. [82] even coexpressed glucose dehydrogenase
(GDH) for efficient cofactor regeneration. More details
were outlined and reviewed by Faber [24] and Stuermer
et al. [71], respectively.

1.3 Oxidation and racemization reactions
Yeast alcohol oxidases were shown to be responsible for
the oxidation of methanol and other primary alcohols
[83-85]. However, they did not oxidize secondary
alcohols. In general, reports on oxidation reactions
performed by yeasts are quite rare. Considering especially the oxidation of secondary alcohols, one has to
recognize that instead of creating a chiral center, it is
‘destructed’. The reaction is therefore regarded to be of
limited synthetic use except for the regioselective
oxidation of polyols where chemical methods are often
inadequate [24]. However, the recent, increasing
demand for ‘deracemization processes’, leading to a
single stereoisomer in 100% yield, evoked the need for
‘clean’ racemization protocols [86]. Not to forget, the
oxidation of sulfides can result in chiral sulfoxides which
have been widely used in organic synthesis as asymmetric auxiliary groups to control the stereochemical
outcome of the reaction at nearby centers [87,88].

In 1979, Patel et al. [89] described the application of cell
suspensions of Candida utilis ATCC 26387, Hansenula
polymorpha ATCC 26012, Pichia sp. NRRL-Y-11328,
Torulopsis sp. and Kloeckera sp. for the oxidation of
secondary alcohols. 2-Propanol, 2-butanol, 2-pentanol,
and 2-hexanol were oxidized to the corresponding
methyl ketones. Furthermore, Saccharomyces cerevisiae
was reported to catalyze the selective oxidation of
sulfides to sulfoxides. Beecher et al. [90] investigated
the oxidation of p-tolyl sulfide to the R-sulfoxide (92%
ee) which was used for the preparation of the mevinic
acid-type hypocholestemic agent. Buist et al. [91]
employed baker’s yeast for the enantioselective sulfoxidation of a fatty acid analogue (~70% ee). In this study,
the authors presumed that a desaturase could be
responsible for the transformation, but did not verify it.
In order to satisfy needs for sophisticated racemization
protocols, Nestl et al. [86,92] screened various microbial
cells for the biocatalytic racemization of functionalized
a-hydroxyketones. Although whole lyophilized cells of
Geotrichum candidum DSM 6401, Candida parapsilosis
DSM 70125, or Kluyveromyces lactis DSM 3795 were

identified to racemize a variety of the employed target
substrates, the activities of yeast strains were modest
compared with bacteria and fungi. Traces of diketones as
‘side products’ let them assume that dehydrogenase
enzymes were responsible for the racemization reaction
[86].
Matsuyama et al. [61] performed the oxidative kinetic
resolution for the large-scale production of (R)-1,3butanediol employing Candida parapsilosis IFO 1396.
Starting with 20 kg (rac)-1,3-butanediol, 258 kg cells,
465 kg water and 7.5 kg calcium carbonate resulted in
~3.1 kg of (R)-1,3 butanediol in high chemical (~99%)
and optical purity (94% ee). A subsequent enzyme
purification step elucidated (S)-1,3-butanediol dehydrogenase (CpSADH) to be responsible for producing (R)1,3-butanediol from the racemate. CpSADH was then
also overexpressed in E. coli yielding in increased specific
activities and a strain with good racemization properties
for the production of (R)-1,3-butanediol (95% yield,
94% ee) without the need for cofactor regeneration.
Recently, Titu and Chadha [93] described the biocatalytic preparation of optically pure alkyl 3-(hetero-2-yl)-3hydroxypropanoates by deracemization. Candida parapsilosis ATCC 7330 was employed and various optically
pure products resulted in high ee (89–99%) and yields
(58–75%). These compounds represent important chiral
intermediates for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals such
as duloxetine, tetrahydropyrans or heteroarylaminoalkanols, among others.
In most cases, however, the enzyme or enzyme-set
catalyzing racemization reactions remains unknown.
Their identification and employment in a non-natural
environment (biotransformation with solubilized or
immobilized enzyme(s) or a recombinant whole-cell
biocatalyst) could further reduce the amount of undesired side-reactions, improve optical purities and also
provide a platform for enzyme engineering approaches.
Examples of ‘yeast designer bugs’ with enzymes for chiral
sulfoxide production are given in Section 3.

1.4 Hydrolase reactions
Saccharomyces cerevisiae was also tested for hydrolase
reactions. However, first yeast-catalyzed deacylation
reactions were regarded to be undesired side-reactions
when Mamoli et al. [94] was studying whole cells of
baker’s yeast for the stereoselective reduction of estrogen
ester. Later, the whole variety of hydrolysis reactions
performed by Saccharomyces cerevisiae was investigated
and comprehensive reviews on the properties of proteinases [95], lipases and esterases [34] were given. What
was encountered quite fast was the complex reaction
control when whole microbial cells were employed [24].

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/25

To overcome the problems resulting from the metabolism of fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae, lyophilized
resting cells were employed. Thus, for example the
acetate of pantolactone – the chiral precursor for vitamin
B5 synthesis – was nicely resolved [96]. In addition,
differently substituted 1-alkyn-3-yl acetates were converted with high ee (91–96%) to the corresponding (S)alcohols and acceptable enantioselectivities (E ~46–100)
were reached [24].
Many yeast hydrolases especially from Candida sp. were
employed in industrial biotransformations. However,
they were mostly used as immobilized enzyme preparations due to perturbing unspecific hydrolases available
in whole cells. Only were other fungal and some
bacterial strains industrially employed as whole cells
for hydrolase reactions [74]. Immobilized whole cells of
Fusarium oxysporum were for example used for the
production of D-pantoic acid starting with (rac)-pantolactone [97]. Suspended whole cells of Comamonas
acidovorans catalyzed the conversion of (rac)-2,2dimethylcyclopropanecarboxamide to the corresponding
(R)-carboxylic acid and the (S)-carboxamide remained
[98]. In addition, whole cells of Bacillus brevis [99,100],
Pseudomonas sp. [74] and Arthrobacter sp. [101] were
employed i.a. for hydantoinase catalyzed reactions.
Furthermore, Rhodotorula sp., Rhodosporidium sp. and
Trichosporon sp. were found to give best enantioselectivities for the hydrolysis of monosubstituted oxiranes.
All showed preferred enantiopreference for the (R)-form
and regioselectivity for the sterically less hindered carbon
atom [24]. Recently, again a highly selective epoxide
hydrolase from Rhodosporidium paludigenum CBS 6565
was observed during whole-cell biotransformations,
subsequently cloned and further characterized [102].

1.5 Formation of C-C-bonds
From a synthetic point of view, carbon-carbon bond
forming reactions are highly interesting as new asymmetric carbon centers can be formed. However, this type
of yeast whole-cell biotransformation was and is limited
to only a few examples [30,34]. The most prominent and
industrially employed acyloin condensation performed
by Saccharomyces cerevisiae yields in the formation of
(1R)-phenylacetyl carbinol, a chiral synthon of Dephedrine (Table 2 and Additional File 2). Crout et al.
[103] succeeded in finding out the detailed reaction
pathway, involving pyruvate decarboxylase [104]. Not
only benzaldehyde can be subjected to baker’s yeast
mediated acyloin condensations. Fuganti et al. [105,106]
also investigated the conversion of a,b-unsaturated
aldehydes giving optically active diols and used this
type of reaction for the production of the C-14

Microbial Cell Factories 2008, 7:25

chromanyl moiety of a-tocopherol (vitamin E) [107]. An
interesting L-threonine aldolase was isolated from
Candida humicola. However, only the isolated enzyme
was characterized [108].

2. Application of yeast whole-cell biocatalysis in industry
One of the first industrial processes combining microbiological and chemical synthesis was the acyloin-type
condensation [109] of benzaldehyde resulting in (1R)phenylacetylcarbinol which is subsequently converted to
(1R, 2S)-ephedrine and (1R, 2S)-pseudoephedrine,
respectively. For that purpose, Saccharomyces cerevisiae
whole cells were used in an aqueous medium [110]. The
products find application for the treatment of asthma,
hay fever and as a bronchodilating agent and decongestant [74,110].

In addition to this application, two more lyase-based
biocatalytic approaches with whole cells were employed
in industry: Candida rugosa enoyl-CoA hydratase catalyzes for example one of three biotransformation steps
from butyric acid to (R)-b-hydroxy-n-butyric acid
[100,111], namely the enantioselective introduction of
a hydroxy-group at the b-position of the a,b-unsaturated
acid which resulted after dehydrogenation. The chiral
product is produced with high optical purity (> 98% ee)
and a space-time yield of 5–10 g·LÀ1·dÀ1. It is used for
the production of a carbapenem intermediate [74]. The
same whole-cell biocatalyst is also capable of converting
isobutyric acid to (R)-b-hydroxy-isobutyric acid, in this
case with 98% yield, 97% ee and again a space-time yield
of 5–10 g·LÀ1·dÀ1 [100,111,112]. (R)-b-hydroxy-isobutyric acid is a chiral synthon for the synthesis of
captopril, an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme
[74]. Secondly, suspended whole cells of Rhodotorula
rubra possess an L-phenylalanine ammonia lyase which
performs the selective transformation of trans-cinnamic
acid and ammonia to L-phenylalanine. The reaction is
performed in aqueous solution at 25°C and pH 10.6 and
results in 85.7% yield. The L-phenylalanine is commonly
applied for the production of artificial sweeteners like
aspartame and in parenteral nutrition. It can also be used
for the synthesis of macrolide antibiotics such as
rutamycin B [74,99,100].
Most yeasts which are industrially employed for wholecell biocatalysis however are used for asymmetric
reductions. Eli Lilly for example employed whole cells
of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii for the enantioselective
reduction of 3,4-methylenedioxy-phenylacetone to the
corresponding (S)-alcohol. Since the substrate was toxic
to the microorganism, it was provided in an adsorbed
form on the resin XAD-7. This allowed elevated reaction
concentrations and high levels of volumetric

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/25

productivity. The process showed a space-time yield of
75 g·LÀ1·dÀ1 and a high optical purity (> 99.9% ee)
[113-116]. The strain Geotrichum candidum SC5469 was
described to be employed by Bristol-Myers Squibb for
the stereoselective reduction of 4-chloro-3-oxo-butanoic
acid methyl ester to the corresponding (S)-3-hydroxyalcohol [74]. This conversion yielded the product in 95%
yield and 99% ee and thus provided a useful chiral
building block, e.g. for the synthesis of a cholesterol
antagonist that inhibits hydroxymethyl glutaryl CoA
reductase [117,118]. Furthermore, a second Candida sp.,
namely Candida sorbophila, was employed for the
production of a chiral (R)-amino alcohol (Entry 3 in
Table 2 and Additional File 2) with high optical purity
(> 98% ee; 99.8% after purification) and high chemical
purity (95%) [119]. The resulting (R)-amino alcohol is
an important chiral synthon for the synthesis of a b-3agonist which can be used for obesity therapy and the
treatment of associated type II diabetes, coronary artery
disease and hypertension [74,120].
The yeast Pichia methanolica was applied by Bristol-Myers
Squibb because of its beneficial reductase for the
reduction of ethyl 5-oxo-hexanoate and 5-oxo-hexanenitrile to the corresponding (S)-alcohols. The reaction
resulted in high yield (90–95%) and high enantiomeric
excess (> 95%) [121].
Chiral intermediates for the production of the antihypertensive drug, Omapatrilat, were produced by two
different biocatalytic approaches (Entry 5 in Table 2 and
Additional File 2 ): In both cases the enzyme phenylalanine dehydrogenase from Thermoactinomyces intermedius (TiPheDH) was employed for the reductive
amination step and a yeast formate dehydrogenase
(FDH) was required for NADH regeneration. For the
first, heat-dried cells of recombinant E. coli with cloned
TiPheDH were used together with heat-dried Candida
boidinii cells, as a source of FDH. The conversion resulted
in 96% yield and > 99% ee. Secondly, dried recombinant
Pichia pastoris cells containing endogenous FDH and
overexpressing TiPheDH were employed. The application of the second biocatalyst resulted in slightly
improved yield (97.5%) and also high enantiomeric
excess (> 99%) for the production of (S)-2-amino-5(1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)-pentanoic acid [122]. Regarding
cofactor regeneration, NAD+ produced during the reaction was in both cases regenerated to NADH by the
oxidation of the auxiliary substrate formate to CO2
[123].

5-(4-hydroxybutyl)-hydantoin, is converted to the ketoacid leaving the L-enantiomer. This is then isolated by ion
exchange chromatography and can be used as chiral
synthon, again, for the synthesis of Omapatrilat [43], the
production of a vasopeptidase inhibitor, and the
synthesis of C-7 substituted azepinones which represent
potential intermediates for other antihypertensive
metalloproteinase inhibitors [74]. The remaining 2keto-6-hydroxyhexanoic acid was further converted to
L-6-hydroxynorleucine by reductive amination catalyzed
by beef liver glutamate dehydrogenase (89–92% yield, >
99% ee, 3 h) [124]. Bacillus megaterium glucose dehydrogenase was used for NAD+ recycling.
Furthermore, Saccharomyces cerevisiae was industrially
employed because of its ene-reductase which belongs
to the old yellow enzyme family. The substrate oxoisophorone was subjected to fermentative reduction with
baker’s yeast in an aqueous solution of saccharose.
Periodically, substrate and saccharose were added in
order to avoid toxic levels of oxoisophorone. The
product 2,2,6-trimethylcyclohexane-1,4-dione resulted
in 80% yield and < 97% ee and was used as intermediate
for the synthesis of natural 3-hydroxycarotenoids such as
zeaxanthin, cryptoxanthin and other structurally related
compounds. The space-time yield of the process was
given with 2.8 g·LÀ1·dÀ1 [73,74].
Finally, a hydrolase-based reaction employing whole
cells of Cryptococcus laurentii was used by the Japanese
company Toray Industries Inc. for the synthesis of
L-lysine [99,100,125]. For that purpose actually a
combination of cells from Cryptococcus laurentii with
intrinsic L-lysine lactamase and the bacterium Achromobacter obae with a lactame racemase were used. L-Lysine
resulted with > 99.5% ee and was applied as nutrient and
food supplement. Alternatively, the combination of cells
from the yeast Candida humicola and the bacterium
Alcaligenes faecalis were used. However, this process was
totally replaced by highly efficient fermentation methods
[74]. All above described industrial applications of yeast
whole-cell biocatalysts are depicted in Table 2 and
Additional File 2.

3. Recombinant Yeasts for Whole-Cell Biocatalysis
Remarkable progress in the field of genetic engineering
made a variety of yeast strains, in particular Saccharomyces cerevisiae, susceptible to modifications by recombinant DNA technology. In the mid-1980s, a number of
expression systems based on alternative yeasts appeared
which eliminated some initial limitations to S. cerevisiae
such as low yields or a high extent of undesirable
hyperglycosylation. Advantages and disadvantages of
such ‘nonconventional’ yeasts for recombinant protein

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/25

production were reviewed in detail elsewhere [126-130].
Prominent established examples are Hansenula polymorpha [131], Pichia pastoris [132-134], Kluyveromyces lactis
[135], Yarrowia lipolytica [136], Candida boidinii [128],
and Schizosaccharomyces pombe [137], among others.
In order to circumvent disadvantages of wild-type wholecell biocatalysts, different groups started to construct
‘designer yeasts’ to improve first of all single-step
biocatalytic syntheses. Methods for gene knockout and
overexpression of heterologous enzymes, offered alternative approaches to classical techniques aiming at
improving the whole-cell biocatalyst’s selectivity (see
Section 2). Catalytic activities of competing host-own
enzymes were eliminated and desired catalytic properties
could be reinforced, respectively. First, simple ‘single
mutants’ – with one deleted or overexpressed gene –
were thoroughly studied but soon combinatorial
approaches enlarged the spectrum of valuable wholecell biocatalysts. Of course, the identification of complete genome sequences facilitated investigations and
elucidated the wealth of the host-own enzyme spectrum.
Since the publication of the complete genome sequence
of S. cerevisiae in 1996 [48,49], more than 30 yeast
genomes have been completely or partly sequenced and
deposited in public databases (e.g. NCBI: http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=genome). This information is now available and ready to be exploited for
the construction of valuable whole-cell factories for i.a.
biocatalytic applications.
At the same time, a second branch of science, namely
‘metabolic engineering’, emerged in the field of genetic
engineering and in 1991, Bailey [138] extensively
reviewed this new field for the first time. In the following
years, metabolic engineering has developed rapidly and
consequently resulted in various reviews [139-142] and
textbooks [143,144] explaining basic principles and
methodologies. The many existing examples of metabolic engineering were classified in several categories
which include heterologous protein production, extension of substrate range, pathways leading to new
products, pathways for the degeneration of xenobiotics,
engineering of cellular physiology for process improvement, elimination/reduction of by-product formation
and improvement of yield or productivity [142]. All
approaches have two important parts in common: first,
the identification of the most promising target(s) for
genetic manipulation by solid strain analysis and
second, the construction of genetically modified cells
[141]. As several categories of metabolic engineering and
the construction of recombinant strains for whole-cell
biocatalysis target at improving similar characteristics of
a cell, it is not always possible to draw a clear line
between these two disciplines. However, the variety of

Page 12 of 36

Microbial Cell Factories 2008, 7:25

recent reports on metabolic engineering of yeasts for the
efficient production of top value added chemicals (e.g.
ethanol, glycerol, xylitol, succinic acid and other organic
acids) [145] would go beyond the scope of this review.
Therefore, we refer to existing comprehensive overviews
in this field of research [141,142,146-150].
In the following we focus on engineered yeast platform
strains for the production of mostly chiral precursors for
the pharmaceutical, food or feed industry, thereby
including single- and multi-step biocatalytic reactions.
Finally, we highlight recent pathway engineering efforts
leading to structurally complex natural products, a field
which indicates the possible catalytic scope of engineered yeasts.

3.1 Organic single or few-step transformations catalyzed by
engineered yeast cells
Employing non-engineered yeast strains for whole-cell
biotransformations has often resulted in low chemical
and optical purities. As selective reduction and oxidation
reactions are the most thoroughly investigated applications of whole-cell yeast biocatalysts, the first recombinant yeast strains were also engineered for this class of
biotransformations. Several groups subjected S. cerevisiae
to step-by-step gene knockout and overexpression of
various reductases and studied the catalytic properties of
the resulting engineered yeast strains in detail (Table 3
and Additional File 3).

In 1985, Shieh et al. [151] already succeeded in
improving the optical purity for ethyl (R)-4-chloro-3hydroxybutanoate production starting with the prochiral
b-keto ester. They employed the S. cerevisiae ATCC 26403
mutant lacking a competing b-keto reductase and
achieved 90% ee compared to 57% ee for the wild-type
strain [151]. Fifteen years later, Rodríguez et al. [152]
altered the levels of three S. cerevisiae oxidoreductases,
namely fatty acid synthase (Fasp), aldo-keto reductase
(Ypr1p), and a-acetoxy ketone reductase (Gre2p),
respectively. They first created a set of ‘first-generation’
yeast strains deleting or overexpressing only one single
enzyme at a time. Based on subsequent results, a
‘second-generation’ set of yeast strains was constructed,
combining gene deletion and overexpression. Several
b-keto esters were used as substrates and among the
engineered strains not only significantly improved
stereoselectivities compared to the wild-type but also
engineered strains with inverted selectivities were found
[152] (see for example Table 3 and Additional File 3,
Entry 2, Substrate d and e). However, this study also
revealed that additional yeast proteins exist which might
participate in the reduction of some of the subjected
b-keto ester substrates and deteriorate especially

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/25

enantiopurities. Later, forty-nine open reading frames
encoding for potential reductase activities were elucidated in the complete S. cerevisiae genome [68].
However, up to now not all corresponding reductases
have been investigated in detail. Some selective alternative S. cerevisiae reductases were identified and
examined by Gorwa-Grauslund and coworkers
[153,154]. Overexpressing the NADPH-dependent
reductases Ara1p, Ypr1p and YMR226c, respectively,
led to yeast strains with increased yield (≥ 48%) and
enantiomeric excess (≥ 87%) for the conversion of
diacetyl to (S)-acetoin (wild-type: 42% yield, 80% ee)
[153,154]. Furthermore, Johanson et al. [155] improved
the asymmetric reduction of a bicyclic diketone to
(1R,4S,6S)-6-hydroxy-bicyclo[2.2.2]octane-2-one which
is used as intermediate for the production of transition
metal-based chiral chemical catalysts [156]. A combination of reaction and strain engineering (overexpression
of the S. cerevisiae reductase YDR368w in S. cerevisiae –
Table 3 and Additional File 3) led to 84% yield, > 99%
ee and 97% de compared to initially described results
with 52% yield, 95% ee, and 84% de – after chromatography and crystallization [157]. Recently, Kratzer et al.
[158] succeeded in overcoming limitations of baker’s
yeast in the asymmetric reduction of a-keto esters using
also a combinatorial approach. They improved the
enzyme by exchanging the amino acid residue tryptophane 23 with phenylalanine (CtXR-W23F) which
resulted in an up to eightfold higher NADH-dependent
activity compared to the wild-type enzyme employing a
series of aromatic a-keto esters as substrates [159]. The
strain S. cerevisiae was engineered to efficiently overexpress CtXR-W23F by introducing multiple copies of
the expression cassette (strain S.c. WF2μ). Finally, the
reaction itself was optimized performing it under
anaerobic conditions in the presence of EtOH. Thereby
NADH-regeneration was preferred. This was accomplished by the yeast’s own NADH-dependent alcohol
dehydrogenase (ADH) and NAD(P)H-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase (AlDH). Thus, the action of
endogenous NADPH-dependent yeast reductases with
diverse enantiopreferences was suppressed [158].
a-Hydroxy esters were obtained in acceptable yields
and high enantiopurities (≥ 99.4% ee, see Table 3 and
Additional File 3, Entry 6).
Exploiting the advantage of S. cerevisiae to be ‘Generally
Regarded As Safe’ (GRAS) for human consumption,
Farhi et al. [160] engineered this yeast for the improved
synthesis of the food flavoring methyl benzoate. This
was achieved by expressing the Antirrhinum majus
benzoic acid methyltransferase (BAMT) under the control of the copper-inducible CUP1 promoter. A yield of
~1 mg methyl benzoate per liter of culture was achieved
after 24 h, starting with benzoic acid. In addition, it was

demonstrated that yeast strains expressing BAMT were
more tolerant towards benzoic acid. Several groups also
focused on engineering S. cerevisiae in order to modulate
and improve the formation of antioxidants and aroma
compounds during wine fermentation. In 2000, González-Candelas et al. [161] used a transgenic yeast strain for
the improved production of resveratrol, an antioxidant
which was reported to possess cancer chemoprotective
properties [162,163]. They expressed the Candida
molischiana bglN gene encoding for a b-glucosidase in
the industrial wine yeast S. cerevisiae T73 (CECT1894)
and yielded elevated contents of both trans- and cisresveratrol (≥ 0.75 μM) compared to the wild-type
(≥ 0.25 μM) [161]. Further engineering concepts for
improved resveratrol production with recombinant yeast
strains are discussed in detail in chapter 3.4. Subsequently, Genovés et al. [164] optimized the production
of recombinant Candida molischiana BGLN enzyme in
S. cerevisiae and tested the purified BGLN enzyme for
vinification experiments. The efficient release of terpenes
and alcohols from Muscat wine glycosides was observed.
Smit et al. [165] tried to develop wine yeasts with
optimized decarboxylating activity on phenolic acids.
Therefore, two different phenolic acid decarboxylases
(PADC from Bacillus subtilis and p-coumaric acid decarboxylase (PDC) from Lactobacillus plantarum) were
expressed in S. cerevisiae under the control of the
constitutive S. cerevisiae phosphoglyceratekinase I gene
promoter and terminator (PGK1P and PGK1T). In most
of the Chardonnay and Riesling wines, the vinification
done by the recombinant strains resulted in slightly
increased 4-ethylphenol, 4-vinylphenol and 4-vinylguaiacol concentrations. However, first results of industrial yeast fermentation analysis showed very high
concentrations of volatile phenols close to and even
higher than the ideal concentration. Thus, further
improvements are necessary including a better regulation
of the recombinant enzyme’s overproduction or the preevaluation of the available concentration of precursor –
namely phenolic acid components – in the grape juice.
Cordente et al. [166] engineered S. cerevisiae in order to
optimize concentrations of volatile esters which represent the largest and most important group of wine
flavoring components produced during fermentation.
They overexpressed the major mitochondrial and peroxisomal carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT2p) from S.
cerevisiae but instead of increased levels of ester
compounds reduced concentrations were observed. The
authors hypothesized that the overexpression of Cat2p
favors the production of acetylcarnitine and CoA and
therefore limits the precursor for ester formation [166].
Finally, Stewart and coworkers tested a Saccharomyces
cerevisiae strain expressing the cyclohexanone monooxygenase from the bacterium Acinetobacter sp. NCIB 9871

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/25

with a variety of substituted cycloalkanones [167-170] and
several sulfides, dithianes and dithiolanes [88], respectively
(Table 4 and Additional File 4). Thereby, they combined
the broad substrate tolerance of the enzyme with baker’s
yeast tolerance for relatively high concentrations of organic
compounds, providing a stable environment for the
enzyme. Furthermore, no enzyme purification or additional NADPH-regeneration system was necessary and the
enzyme from this potentially pathogenic bacterial strain
(class II) [88] became easily accessible. Enzyme induction
in the Acinetobacter strain also required the addition of
cyclohexanol which complicated product isolation [68].
Table 4 and Additional File 4 depicts detailed results of
enantioselective Baeyer-Villiger oxidations with the above
described ‘designer yeast’. Although high optical purities
were achieved with the majority of investigated substrates,
it is still clear that yields must be improved significantly in
order to allow the biocatalyst’s commercial application
[68].
In addition to S. cerevisiae strains, also alternative yeasts
were genetically modified to exhibit beneficial oxidoreductase properties (Table 3 and Additional File 3).
Rhodotorula glutinis epoxide hydrolase was for example
overexpressed in Pichia pastoris leading to a 10-fold
elevated activity toward (R)-styrene oxide conversion
compared to the R. glutinis wild type. Kinetic resolution
of racemic styrene oxide yielded in the (S)-styrene oxide
with 98% ee and 36% yield [171]. A recombinant
Schizosaccharomyces pombe strain coexpressing the human
cytochrome P450 CYP11B1 mutant V78I and the
electron transfer proteins adrenodoxin (Adx) and adrenodoxin reductase (AdR) showed a 2.5-fold higher 11bhydroxylation activity than the parental strain for the
production of hydrocortisone [172]. Furthermore, Peters
et al. [173] developed a Schizosaccharomyces pombe strain
expressing human CYP2D6 and evaluated its principle
feasibility for the synthesis of 4’-hydroxymethyl-apyrrolidinobutyrophenone (56% yield, 98.5% purity –
Table 3 and Additional File 3). Other yeast whole-cell
biocatalysts which were engineered to display enzymes
on their surface are described in section 3.3.

3.2 Cofactor regeneration using genetically engineered yeasts
As far as organic biotransformations are concerned, the
most common application of yeast whole-cell biocatalysts is for asymmetric reductions. For these synthetically
useful reactions cofactor-dependent enzymes are
required. Considering the cost of NAD(P)+ and NAD
(P)H, their stoichiometric application is not economically feasible unless an efficient regeneration method is
employed which allows the use of only low amounts
[174]. In general, whole-cell biocatalysts provide the
cheapest cofactor regeneration system preventing the

laborious procedure of enzyme isolation and taking
advantage of prolonged enzyme stability and cofactor
recycling from cheap auxiliary substrates. However, there
exist several disadvantages when employing wild-type
whole-cell biocatalysts (see Section 1.1).
Recently, improvements in cofactor regeneration systems
were comprehensively reviewed focusing on pyridine
nucleotide regeneration [175], cofactor regeneration with
genetically engineered bacteria [176] and new methods for
the improved regeneration of ATP/NTP, sugar nucleotides
and PAPS (3’-phosphoadenosine-5’-phosphosulfate)
which is involved in sulfuryl transfer reactions [177]. In
most cases however isolated enzymes and genetically
modified bacteria were employed. Regarding again S.
cerevisiae, only traditional approaches were followed,
using the yeast for its supply of reducing power and
encountering serious drawbacks when trying to freely
combine it with desired non-natural substrates. Stewart
and coworkers [47,68,168] were among the first scientists
who constructed genetically engineered S. cerevisiae strains
and thereby reduced undesirable dehydrogenase background reactions by deleting single reductase genes. Thus,
it became again more attractive to utilize the S. cerevisiaeown cofactor regeneration system for the asymmetric
reduction of selected ketones. However, considering all
attempts it seems that the potential of S. cerevisiae as
whole-cell redox-biocatalyst has not been fully exploited
yet. The huge number of existing S. cerevisiae genes
encoding for reductases suggests a more complex strategy
such as temporarily silencing of metabolic pathways either
by reaction engineering as indicated by Kratzer et al. [158]
(see Chapter 3.1, Table 3 and Additional File 3) or by
regulation of gene expression, a perhaps more challenging
approach.
At the same time, metabolic engineers also investigated the
impact of cofactor engineering on the redox metabolism of
S. cerevisiae. Nissen et al. [178] expressed for example the
cytoplasmic transhydrogenase from Azotobacter vinelandii in
S. cerevisiae CBS8066. Transhydrogenases, which were not
found in yeasts [179,180], catalyze the hydrogen transfer
between the two cofactor systems NADH/NAD+ and
NADPH/NADP+. Nissen’s results indicated that when
introducing a transhydrogenase in yeast, the conversion
of NADP(H) and NAD+ to NADP+ and NADH was favored
[178]. This was already observed by Anderlund et al. [181]
who constructed recombinant S. cerevisiae strains expressing a membrane-bound E. coli transhydrogenase. In
contrast, Nielsen and coworkers [182] also succeeded in
constructing genetically engineered S. cerevisiae strains with
a modified ammonium assimilation pathway for increased
NADPH availability. Therefore, the NADPH-consuming
glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH1) was deleted and an
alternative pathway consisting of an NADH-consuming

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/25

GDH2 or the ATP-dependent glutamine synthetase
(GLN1) and the NADH-dependent glutamate synthase
(GLT1) was introduced. The major redox alteration of the
engineered strain was shown by a reduced flux through the
pentose phosphate pathway during aerobic growth on
glucose. Finally, this switch in cofactor requirement for
ammonia assimilation resulted in both an increase in
ethanol yield (10%) and a significant reduction of the
glycerol yield (~40%) [183]. Furthermore, S. cerevisiae
strains with a decreased intracellular NADH pool were
generated by expressing the Lactobacillus lactis H2O-forming
NADH oxidase [184]. A major consequence of the thus
provided NAD+ excess led to a significant reduction in
ethanol yield (15%). This strategy could provide a route to
reduce and adjust the ethanol content of fermented
beverages like beer or wine [184]. The overexpression of
alternative oxidases could also result in valuable strains for
NAD+ regeneration.
Recently, the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris was
engineered for efficient NADH regeneration in our
laboratory (F. S. Hartner, personal communication).
The concept included the decrease in MeOH assimilation
by deleting two dihydroxyacetone synthase genes.
Thereby, the existing methanol utilization pathway –
generating two molecules of NADH while methanol is
irreversibly oxidized to CO2 – was enhanced. This
approach led to improved space-time yields and specific
conversion rates for the conversion of acetoin to 2,3butanediol catalyzed by the overexpressed S. cerevisiae
butanediol dehydrogenase. In this case, methanol was
used as a cosubstrate for NADH regeneration but also as
an inducer for the expression of the heterologous catalyst
and the endogenous NADH regeneration pathway.
Furthermore, engineered S. cerevisiae cells overexpressing
hexokinase or glucokinase were reported to almost
completely convert adenosine (130 mM) to ATP [185],
providing a possible ATP regeneration system [25].
Again E. coli and the yeast S. cerevisiae are the most often
and thoroughly studied organisms regarding attempts to
optimize cofactor recycling by genetic engineering.
However, especially methylotrophic yeasts provide interesting alternatives for engineering endogenous cofactor
recycling pathways.

3.3 Transport limitations and displaying enzymes
on the surface of yeast whole-cell biocatalysts
Considering whole-cell processes, it would be ideal if the
starting material was transported into the cell and if
products were released without any limitation. The production rate would then only be dependent on the cell’s
metabolic functions including the catalyst’s kinetic

Microbial Cell Factories 2008, 7:25

limitations. In reality, bioprocesses are often drastically
limited by barrier functions of the cell wall or membrane. In
order to circumvent these limits, permeabilization methods
are common practice. Recently, Chen [186] reviewed
standard permeabilization protocols including efficient
methods for yeasts such as solvent [187-189], detergent
[190] or alkaline [191] treatment and air-drying at 42°C
[192], respectively. However, classical permeabilization
methods often show serious shortcomings causing extensive
damage to membrane systems, even cell lysis [193], which
makes cofactor regeneration or the reuse of the catalyst
impossible. Furthermore, downstream processing can be
complicated. Recently, molecular engineering approaches
provided an alternative route to solve the cell permeability
issue in a way that can be better predicted [186]. Either outer
membrane structures were engineered – a method which
was up to now only used for bacterial cells – or enzymes
were displayed on the cell surface. In the following the later
method will be discussed in more detail.
Molecular displaying techniques allow the targeting of
heterologous proteins to the surface of yeast strains. They
are covalently linked to the internal, skeletal layer of b-1,3and b-1,6 glucan complexed with chitin and protrude to
the outer layer of glycoproteins [194]. This technique
provides several advantages: The anchoring to the cell
surface can eliminate purification and separation processes
and result in increased biocatalyst stability. Benefits of S.
cerevisiae which has GRAS status and is well suited for the
expression of proteins from eukaryotes can be combined
with economic aspects like facilitated biocatalyst recycling
due to the self-immobilization of the recombinant
enzymes, simple cultivation and fast growth to high cell
densities. Furthermore, mass transport problems of substrate and/or product across the cell membrane can be
prevented as the enzyme, necessary for catalysis, is
displayed on the cells’ surface [195,196]. This is especially
important when polymeric compounds are used as
substrates. In spite of these benefits, current disadvantages
of whole-cell biocatalysts with enzymes anchored to their
cell wall should not be neglected such as current
limitations to one- or few-step reactions, the restriction to
simple biotransformations independent of costly cofactors
and the loss of the protective subcellular environment
providing optimal ionic, pH- and redox-conditions for
enzymatic reactions. However, one or the other disadvantage could be solved by further genetic engineering
approaches such as co-displaying of a cofactor-dependent
oxidoreductase and an enzyme for cofactor recycling or the
engineering of the outer membrane structure of yeast cells
to improve the conditions in the vicinity of the displayed
enzyme.
In particular, Japanese scientists succeeded in developing
the first enzyme-displaying yeast cells and investigated

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/25

their application for whole-cell biocatalysis focusing on
hydrolases. They studied for example the optical resolution
of (RS)-1-phenylethanol by enantioselective transesterification with vinyl acetate [197]. Therefore, S. cerevisiae MT8-1
cells were employed which displayed the pro-region of
Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ProROL) by fusing the flocculation
functional region of the cell-wall protein Flo1p to the
lipase’s N-terminus [198]. The conversion resulted in the
(R)-1-phenylethyl acetate with high yields and enantiomeric excess (> 93%) [197]. Furthermore, Kondo and
coworkers [199] applied S. cerevisiae cells displaying
Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL) for the optical resolution of
(R,S)-1-benzyloxy-3-chloro-2-propyl monosuccinate. After
a reaction time of 16 h, the ROL-displaying yeast had
hydrolyzed the (R)-compound with an eep-value of 95.5%
and a conversion of 50.2%, whereas the employment of
soluble R. oryzae lipase (F-AP15, Amano enzyme Inc.,
Japan) showed quite poor ee and conversion (58.7% eep,
35.9% conv., at 12 h) [199]. The stability of ROLdisplaying yeast cells was confirmed by reusing the
biocatalyst eight times without significant activity loss.
The displaying-technique was also combined with enzyme
engineering: Shibamoto et al. [200] constructed a surfacedisplayed combinatorial library of R. oryzae lipase in S.
cerevisiae which resulted in new biocatalysts with increased
activity for the hydrolysis and methanolysis, respectively, of
soybean oil. Methanolysis yields in methyl esters constituting a potential biodiesel fuel. Recently, Kaya et al. [201]
reported the production of isoflavone aglycones from
isoflavone glycosides employing S. cerevisiae cells. Three
different b-glucosidases from Aspergillus oryzae were individually displayed on the yeast cell surface. The engineered
yeast strain with the b-glucosidase BGL1 (gene ID:
AO090003001511 from the A. oryzae RIB40 genome)
exhibited the highest b-glucosidase activity and first wholecell biotransformations were performed to produce the
isoflavone aglycones daidzein, glycitein and genistein.
Furthermore, Kim et al. [202] described the production
of cyclofructans from inulin. They engineered S. cerevisiae
to display cycloinulooligosaccharide fructanotransferase
from Paenibacillus macerans on the cell surface. As major
product, cycloinulohexaose was detected along with
cycloinuloheptaose and cycloinulooctaose as minor products. Yeast surface display was also used by Wittrup and
coworkers for the FACS-based selection of horseradish
peroxidase variants with enhanced enantioselectivity
toward L- and D-tyrosinol, respectively [203].
Another lipase was displayed by Ueda and coworkers
[204]. They developed S. cerevisiae cells displaying a
mutated form of Candida antarctica lipase B which was
constructed on the basis of the primary sequences of the
CALBs from C. antarctica CBS 6678 and C. antarctica LF
058, respectively. a-Agglutinin was used as anchor protein.
The newly generated biocatalyst displayed high thermal

stability (T1/2 (60°C) = 30 min) and > 6-fold higher
activity for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl butyrate
compared to previously reported CALB mutants generated
by Zhang et al. (CALB-23G5: 86 nmol/min/μg protein)
[205]. However, despite of several advantages such as for
example straight-forward library construction and screening, whole cells displaying enzymes still possess their own
pool of wild-type enzymes that might act on provided
substrates able to diffuse through the cell membrane.
Considering especially esterolytic and lipolytic activities
which are quite common in all organisms, this might lead
to undesirable by-products and a significant reduction of
chemical and optical yield.
A great benefit of the enzyme displaying technique is the
prevention of mass transport problems of the substrate
across the cell membrane. This makes polymeric compounds amenable as substrates for whole-cell biocatalysis.
In the following some examples are given describing the
successful degradation of different polymeric substrates by
recombinant S. cerevisiae cells displaying enzymes on their
cell surface. More details were summarized by Ueda and
Tanaka [206] and Wu et al. [207], respectively. Fukuda
et al. [196] produced chitooligosaccharides from a chitosan
polymer employing yeast cells with Paenibacillus fukuinensis
chitosanase on the yeast surface. The products are a
remarkable resource for the development of e.g. functional
food and diverse materials such as artificial skin [196].
Fujita et al. [208] constructed a Saccharomyces cerevisiae
whole-cell biocatalyst displaying Trichoderma reesei xylanase
II for the degradation of xylan. Furthermore, they developed a yeast strain (S. cerevisiae) which co-displayed three
types of cellulolytic enzymes: Trichoderma reesei endoglucanase II, T. reesei cellobiohydrolase II and Aspergillus
aculeatus b-glucosidase 1 [209]. The generated whole-cell
biocatalyst performed the saccharification and subsequent
fermentation of amorphous cellulose and produced 0.45 g
ethanol per gram of carbohydrate consumed (88.5%
yield).
Although the cell wall of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the
one which is the best characterized among yeasts
[210,211], targeting proteins is also applicable to
alternative variants. Kluyveromyces lactis, for example,
was used to test this and cell-associated a-galactosidase
activity was detected [194]. Recently, Jiang et al. [212]
reported for the first time the displaying of an enzyme
on Pichia pastoris KM71, namely the lipase LipB52 from
Pseudomonas fluorescens B52. Engineered P. pastoris strains
featured a slightly improved thermal stability compared
to a Saccharomyces cerevisiae EBY100-pLHJ026 strain
displaying the same lipase. Furthermore, Yue et al.
[213] developed a new plasmid for the display of
proteins on Yarrowia lipolytica cells providing the basis
for applications in the field of whole-cell biocatalysis.

3.4 Synthetic pathways in yeasts
The construction and employment of ‘designed strains’ for
natural product biosynthesis clearly indicate the potential
of yeast engineering. In recent years, remarkable progress
paved the way for the design of whole-cell biocatalysts
capable of producing structurally complex natural products
and novel variations thereof. An exponentially increasing
number of sequences was elucidated. New bioinformatic
tools providing the basis for analyzing this load of
information were developed and sophisticated tools for
engineering heterologous hosts were established.

Natural products like isoprenoids, flavonoids or polyketides
represent structurally complex compounds which are often
routinely made in nature but require long and elaborate
synthesis routes when classical chemical methods are
employed. Compounds of all three classes have attracted
attention because of their great commercial potential. The
class of isoprenoids includes for example carotenoids which
are valuable antioxidants and food and feed additives,
steroids which are widely used as drugs constituting antiinflammatory, contraceptive and anticancer agents, or
terpenoids like the well-known diterpenoid taxol with its
excellent activity, also against a range of cancers. Flavonoids
which derive from the phenylpropanoid pathway possess
anti-allergenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant activities in humans, and polyketides are applied for the
treatment of cancer (adriamycin), cardiovascular diseases
(lovastatin), immunosuppression (rapamycin, tacrolimus)
or infectious diseases (erythromycin, tetracycline) [214].
As the structural complexity makes the chemical synthesis of
natural products quite difficult, fermentation is regarded to
be an economically feasible alternative to produce pharmaceutically useful compounds for commercial purposes.
Most native organisms producing complex polyketide- or
isoprenoid-derived compounds do not provide high-levels
of these substances as they tend to grow slowly. In addition,
they are often not amenable to genetic manipulation. Thus,
alternative heterologous systems with faster growth and
established genetic engineering techniques seem to provide
an interesting alternative with respect to volumetric
productivity. The relatively homogenous processes towards
the final products are another great benefit of natural
product pathways. Precursors and enzymes of natural
product synthesis pathways are closely related and a kind
of modular system can be established in order to produce
different natural but also novel compounds with therapeutic properties. Improvements of manufacturing processes
are thus possible at a more rapid pace. Essential for the
understanding of the synthetic pathways are not only
genetic techniques for their manipulation but also the
molecular understanding of every individual biocatalytic
step, hence the information gained by simple one-step
biochemical reactions.

So far, Saccharomyces cerevisiae represented again an ideal
host for synthetic pathway engineering due to its rapid
growth, advanced fermentation techniques and well
established genetic tools [215]. In the following some
examples are given employing S. cerevisiae, but also
Candida utilis which was engineered for carotenoid
production (Table 5: Additional File 5 and 6: Additional
File 6).
Carotenoids represent one of the first classes of natural
compounds produced by recombinant yeast strains.
Gene clusters responsible for the synthesis of carotenoids
were isolated from carotenogenic bacteria, including for
example Erwinia sp. and Agrobacterium aurantiacum. Their
function was elucidated [216,217], and essential genes
were introduced to S. cerevisiae and C. utilis, respectively
[218-220]. S. cerevisiae and C. utilis are capable of
accumulating ergosterol as their principle isoprenoid
compound. Obviously, this strongly suggested the
possibility of redirecting the pathway partly to carotenoid production. Finally, engineered C. utilis strains
[218,219] surpassed recombinant S. cerevisiae strains
[221-223] in the production of b-carotene and lycopene
(Table 5 and Additional File 5). Actually, C. utilis strains
performed even better than engineered E. coli, especially
for lycopene production (C. utilis: up to 7.8 mg/g CDW
[218]). Engineered E. coli strains were found to accumulate more than 1 mg/g CDW of lycopene, b-carotene and
zeaxanthin, and more than 0.5 mg/g CDW of astaxanthin [220].
In general, the pivotal intermediate of all isoprenoid
compounds produced in a cell is farnesyl pyrophosphate
[224], which also represents the branching point of the
diverse isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways (Figure 3).
Eukaryotic cells possess a variety of isoprenoid compounds, which are involved in a vast array of cellular
processes such as post-translational modification of
proteins (prenylation) and tRNA modification. They
represent compounds of the lipid bilayer, electron
transporters during respiration, cofactors involved in
enzyme catalysis, and hormones for signal transduction.
In 1999, Dimster-Denk et al. [225] investigated the
regulation of the isoprenoid pathway in S. cerevisiae.
They evaluated the expression of all genes fusing them to
reporter constructs which allowed both, the profiling of
gene transcription and translation. Therefore, the Acacia’s yeast Genome Reporter Matrix™ (GRM) was used,
consisting of reporter-gene-fusion-constructs to > 95% of
all S. cerevisiae genes encoding proteins.
A recent highlight of synthetic pathway engineering was
reported by Keasling and coworkers [226]. They

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/25

engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae for artemisinic acid
(a structurally complex precursor of artemisinin) production with titers of up to 100 mg/L. As natural
artemisinin – extracted from the plant Artemisia annua
L – is highly effective against parasitic Plasmodium spp.,
its improved production would preserve the drug’s
short supply and make it more affordable to most
malaria sufferers. Therefore, Ro et al. [226] improved the
mevalonate pathway, introduced amorphadiene
synthase, and a novel cytochrome P450 monooxygenase
(CYP71AV1) from A. annua that performed together with
its native redox partner CPR (NADPH:cytochrome P450
oxidoreductase) from A. annua a three-step oxidation of
amorpha-4,11-diene to artemisinic acid. The synthesized
artemisinic acid was then transported out of the cell and
was retained on the outside of the engineered yeast,
constituting a simple and inexpensive purification
process for product isolation. In a next step, Shiba
et al. [227] enhanced the supply of acetyl-CoA to the
mevalonate pathway and gained elevated levels of
amorphadiene. This was achieved by engineering the
pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass in S. cerevisiae. Overproduction of acetaldehyde dehydrogenase and introduction of a Salmonella enterica acetyl-CoA synthetase
variant increased the carbon flux into the mevalonate
pathway. This engineering step is generally applicable to
the improvement of the production of isoprenoid
compounds in yeast (see also Figure 3 and last entry in
Table 5 and Additional File 5).
Furthermore, the major adrenal glucocorticoid of mammals, hydrocortisone, was artificially synthesized by
recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae [228]. Therefore, a
fully self-sufficient biosynthetic pathway involving 13
engineered genes was assembled and expressed in a
single yeast strain. Endogenous sterol biosynthesis was
rerouted to produce compatible sterols which served as
substrates for the heterologous part of the pathway. The
biosynthesis involved eight mammalian proteins and
further optimization required the modulation of two
mitochondrial systems and the disruption of unwanted
side reactions associated with the formation of several
unnecessary gene products. Jackson et al. [229] succeeded in engineering S. cerevisiae for the increased
production of the yeast-foreign sesquiterpene epi-cedrol.
Yields of up to 0.37 mg/L were obtained after introduction of the Artemisia annua epi-cedrol synthase gene,
overexpression of a truncated hydroxy-methylglutaryl
CoA reductase and use of a S. cerevisiae upc2-1 mating
type a background. Finally, the first steps of the Taxol
biosynthesis pathway were transferred to S. cerevisiae.
However, DeJong et al. [230] determined only small
amounts (0.025 mg/L) of taxadien-5a-ol but no in vivo
detection of taxadien-5a-acetoxy-10b-ol was possible.

The production of polyketide natural products in
heterologous hosts, incapable of making polyketides
on their own, requires first of all the introduction of a
functional polyketide synthase (PKS). Similar to fatty
acid biosynthesis, PKS is responsible for the condensation of acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA moieties [231].
Kealey et al. [232] and Wattanachaisaereekul et al. [231]
engineered S. cerevisiae for the heterologous production
of 6-methylsalicylic acid (1.7 and 0.2 g/L, respectively).
Mutka et al. [215] first introduced pathways for the
production of methylmalonyl-coenzyme A which constitutes a precursor for complex polyketides. Therefore
two different routes were chosen, namely a propionylCoA-dependent and a propionyl-CoA-independent one.
Furthermore, they achieved to demonstrate that the
methylmalonyl-CoA, which was produced by the yeast
strain, is further converted to a triketide lactone (Table 6
and Additional File 6, Entry 3). 0.5 to 1 mg/L of the
triketide lactone were obtained with the propionyl-CoAdependent route.
Ro et al. [233] engineered S. cerevisiae in order to
reconstitute the entry point of phenylpropanoid metabolism which should enable higher yields of flavonoids
from yeast. Therefore, the Populus sp. enzymes phenylalanine ammonia lyase (isoform PAL2 and PAL4,
respectively), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H) and the
cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR2) were introduced in
the yeast strain. At the end, ~3–10 mg/L of p-coumarate
were obtained employing the triple-expressing strains.
Lately, Vannelli et al. [234] reached 498 μM (= 82 mg/L)
of trans-p-hydroxycinnamic acid (= p-coumarate) with
recombinant S. cerevisiae cells expressing the plant C4H
Cytochrome P-450 and Cytochrome P-450 reductase –
from Helianthus tuberosus – and the Rhodotorula glutinis
phenylalanine ammonia lyase. The highest levels of pcoumarate were achieved in cultures growing on
raffinose and supplemented with 1.0 mM of L-phenylalanine.
Jiang et al. [235] employed S. cerevisiae for the
biosynthesis of naringenin, the central precursor of
various flavonoids. This was accomplished by the
recombinant expression of one yeast and two plant
enzymes, namely phenylalanine ammonia lyase from
Rhodosporidium toruloides, 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase
from Arabidopsis thaliana and chalcone synthase from
Hypericum androsaemum. They obtained ~7 mg/L of
naringenin and 0.8 mg/L of pinocembrin (Table 6 and
Additional File 6, Entry 6). Beekwilder et al. [236] cloned
plant genes involved in the biosynthesis of raspberry
ketone [4-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-butan-2-one] and thus
constructed microbial strains for the synthesis of one
of the most expensive flavor components. In this case,
the recombinant yeast strain converted most of the

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/25

precursor (p-coumaric acid) into hydroxyphenyl-propionic acid and this hampered the proper detection of
raspberry ketone by GC-MS. However, they achieved to
construct a recombinant E. coli BL21 strain expressing
tobacco 4CL2 (4-coumarate-coenzyme A ligase) and
raspberry CHS (chalcone synthase from Rubus idaeus)
which yielded in 5 mg/L of raspberry ketone. For this
purpose, it was grown in a fermenter for 46 h and
enzyme production was induced by the addition of IPTG
and p-coumaric acid. In nature, raspberry ketone occurs
in concentrations between 1 and 4 mg/kg raspberries
[237].
Several groups also engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae
for the synthesis of the antioxidant resveratrol which can
be found especially in red wine. In 2000, GonzálezCandelas et al. [161] already generated a recombinant
yeast strain expressing the Candida molischiana bglN gene
encoding for a b-glucosidase in the industrial wine yeast
S. cerevisiae T73 (CECT1894). In wines produced by the
transgenic yeast strain, the content of trans- and cisresveratrol, respectively, was elevated to ≥ 0.75 μM
compared to ≤ 0.25 μM in wines made with the wildtype. Then, Becker et al. [238] reported for the first time
the reconstruction of a biochemical pathway for resveratrol biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae cells. However, only low
levels of resveratrol (~1.5 μg/L) resulted employing a
recombinant S. cerevisiae strain co-expressing the coenzyme-A ligase from a hybrid poplar and the grapevine
resveratrol synthase gene (Table 6 and Additional File 6,
Entry 8). In 2006, Beekwilder et al. [239] succeeded in
producing significantly higher amounts of resveratrol
with engineered yeast strains (~6 mg/L). They introduced
the 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase (4CL) from Nicotiana
tabacum cv. Samsun and the stilbene synthase (STS) from
Vitis vinifera into S. cerevisiae CEN.PK 113-3b. Using the
same biosynthetic genes, the recombinant yeast production strain was not much less efficient compared to an E.
coli production strain (~16 mg/L). Regarding the
application in human nutrition, the food-grade status
of yeast is a great advantage over E. coli.
Finally, Branduardi et al. [240] engineered S. cerevisiae
for the biosynthesis of L-ascorbic acid (= vitamin C)
starting from D-glucose. They cloned and expressed five
different genes under the control of the S. cerevisiae TPI
promoter, namely the gene encoding for the Arabidopsis
thaliana mannose epimerase, the gene for the A. thaliana
myo-inositol phosphatase/L-galactose-1-P-phosphatase,
the L-fucose guanylyl-transferase from Rattus norvegicus,
the A. thaliana L-galactose dehydrogenase and the S.
cerevisiae D-arabinono-1,4-lactone oxidase in order to
prevent a bottleneck at the end of the pathway. The best
conversion yielded in > 0.1 mg/L/OD L-ascorbic acid. In
addition, they found out that intracellular accumulation

of L-ascorbic acid led to an improved robustness of
recombinant yeast strains towards different stress conditions, such as oxidative stress or the presence of organic
and inorganic acids, respectively [240].
On the one hand, the above summarized attempts to
reconstruct and engineer synthetic pathways in yeasts
clearly depict the potential for the creation of future
yeast whole-cell factories. The huge wealth of basic
knowledge gained in the course of this work has already
improved the understanding of more and more subcellular metabolic networks, their regulation and possible modulation. On the other hand, low yields reported
for almost all complex products indicate that still major
limitations exist which prevent todays yeast cell factories
to be directly put to application. Examples with a high
potential for an implementation in near future might be
a further developed designer strain for the production of
artemisinic acid or resveratrol. Especially for the applications in human nutrition, several yeast strains will
provide interesting alternatives due to their food-grade
status.

Conclusion
Without any doubt, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is the most
thoroughly investigated eukaryotic microorganism and
therefore the most frequently employed yeast strain in
yeast-mediated whole-cell biotransformations. Regarding classical approaches, S. cerevisiae was almost always
among the first biocatalysts chosen to solve the
corresponding catalytic problem. However, finally only
three types of enzymatic reactions were successfully
performed with S. cerevisiae whole cells, namely oxidoreductase- (E.C. 1.-.-.-), hydrolase- (E.C. 3.-.-.-) and lyase(E.C. 4.-.-.-) mediated biotransformations. The same is
true for alternative yeast strains which were found due to
biodiversity screening approaches. Alternative yeast
strains employed for classical whole-cell biocatalysis
are for example Candida sp., Cryptococcus sp., Geotrichum
sp., Issatchenkia sp., Kloeckera sp., Kluyveromyces lactis,
Pichia sp. (including Hansenula polymorpha = P. angusta),
Rhodotorula sp., Rhodosporidium sp., Schizosaccharomyces
pombe, Torulopsis sp., Trichosporon sp., Yarrowia lipolytica
and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii.
Yeast strains employed for biotransformations in industry
include Candida sp., Cryptococcus laurentii, Geotrichum
candidum, Pichia sp., Rhodotorula rubra, Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, Trigonopsis variabilis, and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii.
Up to now only wild-type yeast strains were employed for
industrial applications except for Pichia pastoris strains
expressing the phenylalanine dehydrogenase from Thermoactinomyces intermedius for the production of a chiral

http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/7/1/25

building block for Omapatrilat synthesis. Again, most of
the industrial biotransformations catalyzed by yeast whole
cells were oxidation or reduction reactions. However, three
lyase-based reactions were encountered: S. cerevisiae for the
production of (1R)-phenylacetylcarbinol; Rhodotorula rubra
for the production of L-phenylalanine and Candida rugosa
for (R)-b-hydroxy-n-butyric and (R)-b-hydroxy-isobutyric
acid production.
Regarding engineered yeast whole-cell biocatalysts,
again, oxidoreductase reactions are favored. This also
includes the engineering of more efficient cofactor
regeneration systems whereas yeast surface display
approaches focus on hydrolytic enzymes.
For every biocatalyst engineer, the construction and
employment of synthetic pathways pose probably the
greatest challenge as they require the interrelation of
diverse fields of research. However, they also elucidate
and indicate the catalytic potential and limits of yeast
strains and the capability of metabolic engineering
including available genetic tools. In future, investigations in all different fields related to whole-cell
biocatalysis are required in order to expand the scope
of valuable biocatalytic reactions.
