Strength and tempo of selection revealed in viral
gene genealogies
Trevor Bedford1,2*, Sarah Cobey1,2 and Mercedes Pascual1,2

Abstract
Background: RNA viruses evolve extremely quickly, allowing them to rapidly adapt to new environmental
conditions. Viral pathogens, such as influenza virus, exploit this capacity for evolutionary change to persist within
the human population despite substantial immune pressure. Understanding the process of adaptation in these viral
systems is essential to our efforts to combat infectious disease.
Results: Through analysis of simulated populations and sequence data from influenza A (H3N2) and measles virus,
we show how phylogenetic and population genetic techniques can be used to assess the strength and temporal
pattern of adaptive evolution. The action of natural selection affects the shape of the genealogical tree connecting
members of an evolving population, causing deviations from the neutral expectation. The magnitude and
distribution of these deviations lends insight into the historical pattern of evolution and adaptation in the viral
population. We quantify the degree of ongoing adaptation in influenza and measles virus through comparison of
census population size and effective population size inferred from genealogical patterns, finding a 60-fold greater
deviation in influenza than in measles. We also examine the tempo of adaptation in influenza, finding evidence for
both continuous and episodic change.
Conclusions: Our results have important consequences for understanding the epidemiological and evolutionary
dynamics of the influenza virus. Additionally, these general techniques may prove useful to assess the strength and
pattern of adaptive evolution in a variety of evolving systems. They are especially powerful when assessing
selection in fast-evolving populations, where temporal patterns become highly visible.

Background
RNA viruses evolve extremely rapidly, often with mutation rates one million times greater than vertebrate species [1]. This rate of mutation allows viral populations
to keep pace with rapidly changing environments. Viral
pathogens, such as influenza virus, HIV, hepatitis C
virus and measles virus, place a substantial burden on
global human health. Often, after encountering a particular viral strain, an individual develops long-lasting
immunity specific to this strain. However, in some
viruses, mutations to the virus genome may result in
proteins that are recognized to a lesser degree by the
human immune system, leaving individuals susceptible
to future infection. These mutations rapidly spread
through the virus population in a process known as

antigenic drift. The capacity for rapid evolutionary
change allows the virus population to flourish, despite
substantial immune pressure.
Understanding the process of viral adaptation is critical to our efforts to control the spread of viral pathogens. The evolution of the influenza virus has been
highly studied for these reasons. Repeated epidemics of
seasonal influenza infect between 10% and 20% of the
human population every year, causing 250,000 to
500,000 deaths annually [2]. Mutations to the hemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA) genes are the
primary sources of antigenic change [3]. We expect that
natural selection will promote those mutations that alter
the antigenic character of the virus without causing loss
of function of the HA and NA proteins. Previous studies
have focused on rates of nucleotide and protein change,
examining the ratio of the rates of nonsynonymous
change to synonymous change (dN/dS) in the HA genealogical tree [4-6]. Deleterious mutations are weeded

out from the population, resulting in an overabundance
of deleterious mutations on the side branches of the
tree, while advantageous mutations spread through the
entire population, resulting in an overabundance of
advantageous mutations on the trunk of the tree. These
studies have shown that epitope sites evolve extremely
rapidly on the trunk of the genealogical tree, indicative
of the presence of adaptive evolution [5,6].
Although it is well accepted that adaptive evolution
occurs in influenza, there has been considerable debate
as to the tempo of this adaptation. Understanding the
relative importance of continuous vs. episodic change
appears critical to an adequate explanation of influenza
epidemiological dynamics. Some epidemiological models
have assumed continuous antigenic change [7-9], while
others have assumed episodic antigenic change [10].
These models have sought to understand the general
patterns in genealogical trees of specific influenza A
subtypes and in particular, the mechanisms that limit
the genetic diversity of the virus despite its high transmissibility and mutation rate. Alternative hypotheses
have resulted from these theoretical efforts, emphasizing
on one hand selective sweeps and episodic antigenic
change [10], and on the other, continuous selection and
short-lived strain-transcending immunity [7]. In empirical studies of patterns of nucleotide and protein change,
some authors have argued that adaptive change is continuous [11,12], while others have argued that adaptive
change is discontinuous, occurring in an episodic fashion [6]. Generally, much of this difficulty in analysis
arises from the complex mapping of genotype to antigenic phenotype in influenza; antigenic character may
change substantially without a corresponding genetic
leap [13]. Because of the complexity of the genotypephenotype map, it will necessarily be difficult to directly
extrapolate the presence of sequence changes to an
inference of antigenic innovation. Instead, we propose
using temporally tagged genetic data to examine the
large-scale dynamics of a viral population, searching for
traces left by adaptive evolution in the shape of genealogical trees. This analysis uses phylogenetic and population genetic techniques to characterize the strength and
the timing of adaptive change using sequence data.

Results and Discussion
Effective population size

The genealogical trees of the hemagglutinin genes of
human influenza A (H3N2) and human measles virus
appear immediately distinct, with influenza exhibiting a
ladder-like tree with a long trunk and very short side
branches and measles presenting a bushier tree with
deeper branchings (Figure 1). In influenza, the trunk
branch corresponds to the progenitor lineage; mutations
that occur along the trunk are eventually fixed,

Page 2 of 16

persisting until ‘over-written’ by subsequent mutations.
In contrast, mutations that appear on side branches are
eventually lost from the population. We expect that a
similar progenitor lineage exists in measles, but because
the population turns over much more slowly, we do not
have enough temporal resolution to identify this progenitor lineage.
The competitive mechanisms by which the viral populations replace themselves have important repercussions
for their genealogical trees. It is well known that influenza undergoes extensive antigenic drift, allowing a single individual to be repeatedly infected with successive
strains of influenza differing in antigenic character [2].
The influenza vaccine strain must be continually
updated to remain effective against infection. In contrast, primary infection by measles confers strong lifelong immunity, allowing vaccination to remain effective
through time [14]. In influenza, antigenic drift creates
competition among strains, resulting in the emergence
of selective forces. Here, selection that promotes antigenically novel strains results in rapid population turnover;
in measles, the immune response is equally potent
across strains, resulting in neutral evolutionary dynamics
and slower strain turnover (Figure 1). The interface
between phylogenetic patterns and ecological dynamics
has been referred to as ‘phylodynamics’ [15]. Previous
work on phylodynamic patterns has focused on the
obvious visible differences between the genealogical
trees of influenza and of measles [15]. By calculating the
effective size of each viral population, we attempt to
quantify and explain the differences between the sparse
tree of influenza and the prolific tree of measles.
Effective population size Ne demarks the timescale at
which population turnover occurs. On average, we
expect 2Ne generations for a new mutation to fix in a
haploid population, and we expect Ne generations for
two randomly chosen individuals to find a common
ancestor, a process known as coalescence [16]. The
overall appearance of a genealogical tree will depend
upon the rate at which lineages coalesce with one
another, determined by N e , along with the degree of
temporal spacing among samples. If coalescence is fast
relative to the rate at which sampling occurs, then the
resulting genealogy will appear ladder-like and spindly,
while if coalescence is slow relative to sampling patterns,
then the resulting genealogy will appear dense and
bushy (Figure 2). The coalescent timescale exhibited by
natural populations will depend on both effective population size Ne and on generation time τ, often measured
in years per generation. Thus, a population of Ne = 100
effective individuals with τ = 0.01 years per generation
will have a timescale of coalescence of Neτ = 1 year.
From sequence data alone, it is impossible to independently identify Ne and τ; only their product Neτ can be

Figure 2 Genealogical trees derived from simulated sequences at varying population sizes. In each case, sequence evolution was
simulated using a neutral Wright-Fisher model, and approximately 200 samples were taken over the course of 10,000 generations (sampled at a
Poisson rate of 0.02 per generation). In each frame, the x-axis is shown as intervals of 5000 generations, so that the temporal scale increases with
N. As population size N increases, the time it takes for two lineages to coalesce increases proportionally, so that larger populations show a
deeper most recent common ancestor. Population dynamics result in rapid coalescence when there are many contemporaneous lineages and
slower coalescence when there are few, a detail especially apparent at larger population sizes.

estimated. We fit a phylogenetic model incorporating
the coalescent process to sequence data to estimate genealogical trees and coalescent parameters for influenza
and measles virus (Figure 1). In this case, we estimate
N e τ for HA of influenza A (H3N2) at 7.2 years (95%
credible interval 6.2-8.4) and Ne τ for measles at 124.6
years (100.4-153.9). These estimates give quantification
to the visual differences apparent in genealogical trees.
We arrive at independent estimates of τ via experimental and epidemiological data on the duration of infection, which we take as 5 days for influenza (τ = 0.014
years per generation) [17] and 11 days for measles (τ =
0.030 years per generation) [14]. Our basic results do
not depend on these exact estimates. Dividing by τ
yields estimates of Ne = 526 (451-611) for influenza and
Ne = 4135 (3332-5107) for measles.
In the absence of complicating factors such as selection, spatial population structure or fluctuating population size, effective population size N e is expected to
equal consensus population size N. We arrive at very
rough estimates of the census sizes of influenza and
measles via overall incidence. There are approximately 5
× 108 cases per year of influenza [18], which spread out
over 5 day intervals gives an average of N = 7 × 10 6
cases per generation. There are about 3 × 107 cases per
year of measles [19] or N = 9 × 105 cases per generation. Here, the difference between the census population
size and the effective population size (N/Ne) of influenza
is enormous, approximately 13,000, while the difference
in measles is much smaller, approximately 220.
The observed differences between Ne and N in influenza and measles may be due to multiple causes. Anything that skews reproductive output, so that a small
number of infections contribute disproportionately to
the genetic legacy of viral population, will inflate N/Ne.
Factors could include spatial population structure or
other variation in host contact patterns. However, it is a
well known population genetic finding that selection,
especially positive selection, reduces the effective size of
an evolving population [20]. This is why selective sweeps
are identified in Drosophila and in humans by finding
regions of the genome with low diversity, indicative of
decreased effective population size [20]. We may expect
most of the discrepancy between influenza and measles
to be due to the effects of natural selection, as both
infections represent acute viral infections displaying
strong seasonal epidemics. Thus, without looking at
rates of evolution, we can infer that levels of selection
are substantially greater in influenza than in measles. If
we were to assume complete equivalence of epidemiological factors such as seasonality and spatial structure,
then we would estimate levels of selection in influenza
as 13000/220 = 59 times greater than in measles. This
level of selection is an average, and it may arise from

frequent fixation of weakly adaptive mutations or from
rare mutations of large adaptive impact. We investigate
a more detailed dataset in an attempt to distinguish
between these hypotheses.
Turnover of simulated sequences

To better describe the effects of modes of selection on
tree topology, we undertook a simulation-based study,
in which models of neutral evolution (Figure 3), purifying selection (Figure 4), constant positive selection (Figure 5) and episodic positive selection (Figure 6) were
compared. In each case, an evolving population of
10,000 sequences was simulated according to a WrightFisher model with non-overlapping generations. Each
sequence consisted of 2000 bases and mutated at a rate
of 10-5 per site per generation. In the neutral simulation,
each sequence was assigned equivalent fitness. In the
simulation of purifying selection, each mutation had a
99% chance to be deleterious, and deleterious mutants
had a selective disadvantage of 0.01 relative to their parent’s fitness. In the simulation of constant positive selection, each mutation had a 10% chance to be
advantageous, and advantageous mutants had a selective
advantage s of 0.01 relative to their parent’s fitness. In
the simulation of episodic positive selection, each mutation had a 0.004% chance to yield a selective advantage
of s = 0.1. These parameters were chosen so that the
overall genetic diversity the population was similar in all
three cases with selection. In the cases of constant positive selection and episodic positive selection, it took an
average of ~5000 generations for the population to double in fitness. The population-scaled rate of advantageous mutation Nμa was 20 per generation for constant
selection and 0.008 per generation for episodic selection.
The population-scaled selective advantage Ns was 100
for constant selection and 1000 for episodic selection.
In each simulation, sequences were sampled over the
course of 2000 generations at a rate of one sample per 2
generations to yield approximately 1000 samples in total.
A Bayesian coalescent approach was then used to estimate the gene genealogies connecting these sequences
(Figure 3, 4, 5, 6). It is immediately obvious from these
results that selection constrains tree topology, resulting
in more narrow ladder-like trees in each case of selection
relative to the case of neutrality. Both positive and negative selection constrain both genetic diversity and scaled
effective population size Neτ. Under purifying selection,
the original phenotype remains throughout the simulation (red lineage in Figure 4), but mutations to this lineage often result in less fit phenotypes. These lineages are
quickly purged from the population (Figure 4). In this
case, the mean fitness of the population remains roughly
constant through time, while in both cases of positive
selection fitness increases through time (Figure 5, 6).

There are further differences between the case of constant positive selection and the case of episodic positive
selection. In the case of constant positive selection (Figure 5), the tree appears fairly uniform, although there are
multiple cases where relatively major lineages die out.
Here, the effects of clonal interference [21,22] are apparent. All major lineages continually accumulate beneficial
mutations. However, because there is no recombination,
these mutations cannot be combined onto the same
genetic background, and thus, they are in competition
with one another. The tree shows that lineages that

stochastically accrue more beneficial mutations tend to
outcompete less fortunate lineages. In the case of episodic positive selection (Figure 6), we see that mutation
events result in a rapid transition of the population to the
new allelic state. This rapid transition can be seen as a
sudden crash in genetic diversity, corresponding to the
loss of lineages (side branches) bearing the ancestral
allele. As opposed to what is seen with constant selection,
the disappearance of these lineages is synchronous, e.g.
multiple green lineages simultaneously disappear when
yellow emerges at around generation 1300.

A gene tree represents a complex, high-dimensional
description of the genealogical relation-ships among a
sample of sequences, and cannot be completely summarized by a single statistic. Instead, summary statistics
can be used to probe various aspects of tree topology.
Common summary statistics applicable in this context
include the time to the most common ancestor
(TMRCA) of the sample and the mean pairwise diversity
of the sample, which is the average branch length

distance between pairs of tips on the tree. Here, both
TMRCA and diversity are measured in the same units
(generations) as the branches in the tree. Additionally,
the rate of coalescence can be directly measured from a
genealogy by weighting the number of coalescent events
observed by the total opportunity for coalescence
[23,24]. The inverse of this rate of coalescence yields an
estimate of the scaled effective population size Neτ [16].
For each of these three statistics, we analyzed the

estimate and a 95% credible interval at multiple points
in time. In the cases of TMRCA and diversity, at each
point in time we took a ‘slice’ of contemporaneous
lineages and traced their ancestry backward in time
until arriving at a common ancestor. This effectively
turns a tree with temporally heterogeneous tips into a
tree with all tips at the same point in time. Temporal
‘slices’ were taken every 10 generations. To calculate

Neτ, we analyzed the rate of coalescence in sliding windows of 50 generations in width, moving the center of
the window 10 generations in each step. For comparison, the ‘Bayesian skyline plot’ (BSP) [23,24] popularized
by the software package BEAST [25] shows the same
information as our plots of Neτ through time in Figures
3, 4, 5, 6. If time is measured in generations then Neτ
will be measured in generations, and if time is measured
in years then Neτ will be measured in years. However, in

the literature the quantity measured by the BSP is sometimes referred to as ‘relative genetic diversity’ [26]. We
disagree with this terminology and prefer to use ‘diversity’ to describe the sequence or temporal distance
between lineages, as is standard in the population genetics literature [20]. At equilibrium, an increase in N e τ
won’t result in an immediate increase in diversity;
instead, diversity will slowly increase until an equilibrium compatible with the new value of Neτ is reached.

Under the neutral coalescent, TMRCA and diversity
are expected to equal 2N = 20,000 generations and
effective population size is expected to be equivalent in
generations to the census population size of 10,000 individuals. Coalescent statistics for the neutral case are in
line with these expectations (Table 1 Figure 3). As predicted, measures of TMRCA, diversity and to a lesser
extent N e τ are lower in cases with selection (Table 1
Figure 5, 6). Here, the ancestry of the population is

funneled through a small number of superior individuals, resulting in a decrease in genetic diversity. We
observe that TMRCA, diversity and Neτ remain consistently low under constant negative and positive selection
(Figure 4, 5). In the case of constant positive selection,
there is some evidence of low amplitude cycles in levels
of diversity (Figure 5). However, under episodic selection, we observe large fluctuations in TMRCA, diversity
and Neτ (Figure 6). During periods of selective neutrality, Neτ coincides with the expected 10,000 generations
and TMRCA and diversity gradually increase over time.
This increase would continue until the neutral expectation of 2N generations were reached. However, when a
selectively advantageous mutation appears, it very
quickly sweeps through the population. We observe a
crash in diversity coinciding with the appearance of the
newly emerged, advantageous mutation and a drop in
TMRCA after the sweep is complete. During the course
of the selective sweep, N e τ drops precipitously, but
immediately recovers after the sweep is over.
We propose to use temporal patterns of diversity and
scaled effective population size as tools to judge patterns
of selection in viral genealogies. Both positive and negative selection result in a reduction of diversity. If episodic selection predominates, then we should observe slow
growth and occasional rapid decline in diversity coupled
with a transient drop in Neτ, while if constant selection
predominates, then we should observe much flatter patterns of diversity and Neτ through time. Here, our use of
TMRCA and diversity, complements and extends previous analyses relying on ‘Bayesian skyline plots’ of Neτ.
For a sweep to be found with Neτ, it requires catching
the sweep in action, while a sweep’s effects on diversity
are more long-lasting. Our use of genealogical summary
statistics is similar to that of Drummond et al. [27]. We
recognize that our application of a neutral coalescent
prior in the phylogenetic inference process is non-ideal.
Phylogenetic methods that directly incorporate the
actions of selection into their models of tree topology
would be preferred. Currently, there are theoretical
efforts in directly modeling selection in a coalescent framework, e.g. the ancestral selection graph [28], but
these approaches lack suitable implementations for the
viral genealogies presented here. In our approach, were

use a flexible Bayesian model that gives important
insight into the effects of selection through the parameter Neτ and through genealogy shape. Here, the data
will push the final genealogical inference away from the
neutral coalescent expectation. As such, we can identify
the presence of selection, even if a parameter such an
selective effect s is lacking from the phylogenetic model.
Interaction of selection and population size

It is clear that viral genealogies should be affected by
changes in pathogen population size (as described by
prevalence patterns), as well as by selective dynamics. In
the absence of selection, we expect a general correspondence between increases in prevalence and increases in
Neτ. In this case, Ne should be strickly equivalent to prevalence. However, τ will vary over the course of an epidemic as susceptibles become depleted [29]. During the
initial upswing, τ will be inversely proportional to contact rate, while at equilibrium, τ will be inversely proportional to rate of recovery. Other authors have
extensively demonstrated this correspondence in simulation studies [24,26]. However, with selection in play, it
is not immediately clear what relationship we should
expect between prevalence and Neτ. We investigated this
relationship using further simulations. As before, an
evolving population of sequences was simulated according to Wright-Fisher dynamics. Mutations occurred at a
rate of 10-5 per site per generation, and 1% of mutations
were advantageous. We ran a number of simulations to
ascertain the nucleotide diversity, measured as the persite proportion of nucleotide differences between random pairs of sequences in the population, as a function
of the population size N and the selective coefficient of
advantageous mutations s. In each case, diversity was
estimated as the mean of 105 generations of simulation
after 105 generations of burn-in across three replicate
simulations. The results show that with strong selection,
genetic diversity is effectively divorced from increases in
population size (Figure 7). Under neutrality, genetic
diversity increases linearly with population size, but with
selection, initial increases in genetic diversity occur at
low population sizes, but diversity plateaus at higher
population sizes. This suggests that, in cases of strong
selection, the ancestry of sequences is determined by

selective dynamics and the rapid fixation of advantageous alleles, rather than by the forces of genetic drift as
determined by population size [20].
Measles and influenza show vastly different genealogical patterns (Figure 1); it appears that strains of influenza undergo strong selective pressures based upon
their antigenic phenotypes, while strains of measles are
antigenically similar and exhibit neutral dynamics. Our
results suggest that the genealogical patterns of measles
are strongly impacted by epidemiological patterns,
where increases in prevalence more-or-less directly map
to increases in Ne τ, while the genealogical patterns of
influenza are primarily driven by selective dynamics.
Still, it is clear that prevalence impacts the genealogical
patterns of influenza. Looking just within the USA and
within New Zealand influenza samples, Rambaut et al.
[26] show that N e τ drops during the summer months
and peaks during the winter months, in accordance with
seasonal fluctuations.
Selective dynamics of influenza A (H3N2)

A more detailed look at the recent evolutionary history
of the hemagglutinin gene of influenza A (H3N2)
further reveals the impact of selection on tree topology.
World-wide samples of influenza A (H3N2) taken
between 2000 and 2008 show a pattern of rapid population turnover, with most side-branches persisting for 2-3
years (Figure 8). The overall estimate of Ne τ for these
1270 sequences is very similar to the estimate of N e τ
from many fewer sequences sampled over a longer time
period (6.7 years and 7.2 years respectively). As discussed previously, the overall scale of the influenza tree
as seen in N e τ is indicative of selection, however the

shape of the influenza genealogy further suggests its pervasive influence. If neutral dynamics are occurring, then
we expect to find TMRCA and diversity to be 2× greater
than Neτ. This pattern is supported by our neutral simulation (Table 1). However, if selection is present then
this ratio will be distorted, as it is the case of all simulations involving selection (Table 1). In influenza, we find
that the ratio of TMRCA to Neτ is 0.36 (0.12-0.80) and
the ratio of diversity to Neτ is 0.39 (0.16-0.95) (Table 2).
We are confident that most of these patterns are driven
by positive, rather than negative, selection. Measles virus
undergoes purifying selection to maintain its function
[30], yet its genealogy appears largely congruent with
neutral dynamics. Other genetic studies of influenza
have shown abundant evidence for adaptive evolution of
the HA1 domain, the primary target of the human
immune response [5,6,31].
Interesting temporal dynamics are apparent in the
turnover of the influenza population. From 1999 to
2004, two major lineages of influenza steadily diversified
their HA genes. Coexistence of these lineages leads to a
steady increase in TMRCA and diversity during this
time. TMRCA increases until one of the lineages disappears just before 2004, while diversity increases until
mid-2002, at which point it begins to decline, reaching a
minimum in 2004. After 2004, the dynamics of the
influenza population appear distinct from the dynamics
of the earlier period. From 2004 to 2008, side-branches
continually emerge and die off, so that TMRCA and
diversity remain at a fairly low and constant level. Given
previous simulation results, a reasonable hypothesis for
the selective dynamics from 2000 to 2008 would be a
period of somewhat relaxed selection from 2000 to mid2002 allowing diversity to accumulate, a selective event
in 2002 that causes diversity to decline and TMRCA to
eventually drop, and a period of continuous selection
from 2004 to 2008 that keeps diversity low. However,
even during the 2000 to 2003 period, Ne τ remains far
below its neutral expectation, suggesting that some
degree of selection is always present. The slight increase
in Neτ after 2002 is likely due to sampling effects, before
2002 samples are restricted to China, Oceania and the
USA, while after 2002, sampling is more global. During
this time period, there were no major shifts in influenza
prevalence which could explain these genealogical
patterns.
The preceding description, gathered through genetic
analysis alone, qualitatively agrees with known patterns
of antigenic evolution in the HA gene. From 2000 to
2002, the virus population remained in the Sydney/97
antigenic cluster and evolved very little in antigenic phenotype, although continued to evolve in genotype [13].
This pattern is corroborated by our finding of increasing
diversity during this time period; antigenic change

provides the fuel for selection among strains, and so without antigenic evolution we expect a build up of genetic
diversity. In 2002, the Fujian/02 strain emerged from the
tropics and effected a large jump in antigenic phenotype
[13]. This antigenically novel variant rapidly spread
through the global influenza population, and through this
rapid spread displaced genetic diversity during the course
of 2002-2003. The period from 2004 to 2007 saw a large
amount of antigenic change, first with the California/04
transition and later with more continuous, but rapid

antigenic change, necessitating vaccine updates for Wisconsin/05 and Brisbane/07 [32]. This pattern of sustained
antigenic evolution agrees well with our observation of
continuously low levels of genetic diversity.
The observed consistently low levels of diversity from
2004 to 2008 are indicative of continuous selection on
the global influenza population. However, we caution
that this result is only applicable at a fairly coarse temporal resolution. From simulation, it can be seen that if
a selective events occur sufficiently close together, there
will not be time for diversity to recover and thus the
second selective event will remain to a large extent hidden (Figure 6). It is thus possible that our observations
of continuously low diversity from 2004 to 2008 can be
explained by relatively few selective events, perhaps
close to 4 in the 4 year period. It is also, of course, possible for there to have been more than 4 such events
during this time.

Patterns of diversity may be influenced by the spatial
structure of the global virus population. Indeed, previous
studies have shown that metapopulation dynamics promote persistence and shape genealogical patterns
[32,33]. To gain insight into the confounding influence
of spatial structure on our results, we repeated the analysis of diversity patterns on samples from within China
and Southeast Asia (Table 2 Figure 9). As expected,
overall levels of diversity and N e τ are lower for the

regional influenza population compared to the global
population, although the impact was stronger on N e τ
than diversity (Table 2). We see a similar temporal pattern of growth and decline in genetic diversity for the
regional China and Southeast Asia samples (Figure 9).
Diversity grows from 2000 to 2002, declines from 2002
to 2003 and increases slowly from 2003 to 2007; there is
more variation in post-2004 diversity here than seen in
the global analysis.

The Fujian/02 antigenic variant was first discovered in
southeastern China. Consistent with this geographic origin, diversity within China and Southeast Asia begins to
decline in early 2002, as opposed to the global decline
observed in mid-2002. The vaccine strain Fujian/02 was
not sampled until August 2002. Our analysis suggests
that the original antigenic variant that effected the cluster transition first appeared significantly earlier. Generally, it may be possible that the relatively slow decline in
diversity observed during 2002-2003 may be in part due
to a spatially asynchronous global influenza population.
In this case, a selective sweep will necessarily be constrained by waiting for migration events to spread the
novel variant throughout the world [33].
Thus, it appears that there is a broad correspondence
between patterns of antigenic change and patterns of
genetic diversity. It is generally thought that the HA1
domain of the HA protein experiences the strongest
degree of immune pressure because of its high concentration of epitope-associated sites [5]. Most antigenic
changes in this period appear largely due to amino acid
substitutions in epitopes A and B and the receptor binding domain of HA [34]. However, it has recently been
suggested that the evolution of antigenicity and receptor
specificity are intimately linked, implying that selection
on one will lead to changes in the other [35]. This picture is further complicated by variation in the number
of potential N-linked glycosylation sites (PNGS) on the
surface of HA over this period. Glycans attached to
PNGS have been shown to play a role in antibody
escape, the strength of receptor binding, oligomerization, sorting, and transport [36,37]. Because the addition
of PNGS to H3 HA appears to increase viral clearance
by components of innate immunity, the fact that there
has been an overall increase in the number of PNGS on
H3N2 HA since 1968 suggests its other functions have
greater selective importance [37,38]. It is feasible that
amino acid substitutions in the epitopes in conjunction
with the addition and removal of PNGS result in frequent, incremental changes in strain fitness and
antigenicity.
The effects of other genes on selection in H3 HA are
probably secondary. Analysis of sequences collected in
New York and New Zealand from 1995 to 2008 showed
that the HA gene had consistently the smallest TMRCA
[26], indicating it is under strong selection and thus the
least likely hitchhiker. The gene whose function is most
closely linked to that of HA is NA, which must compensate for changes in the receptor binding affinity of HA.
After HA, NA is under the strongest positive selection
and is an antibody target [31]. In Denmark, amino acid
substitutions in N2 NA epitopes were observed in every
season from 1999-2000 to 2005-2006, in addition to
substitutions in CTL epitopes in other genes [39]. It is

Page 13 of 16

hard to gauge the extent to which genome segments
evolve independently. On the one hand, reassortment
rates are high, with fourteen separate events estimated
from analysis of relatively small populations over four
seasons [40]. On the other hand, subsets of the genome
significantly differ in the amount of phylogenetic history
they share with one another [26], and their genes have
uniquely different functions and constraints.

Conclusions
Multiple epidemiological models have been put forward
in an attempt to explain the observed patterns of diversity in the influenza virus [7-10]. In standard population
genetic models, selection based on Malthusian fitness,
or R 0 in the case of pathogens, will always result in
decreased genetic diversity and effective population size.
However, selection for antigenic novelty may result in
extended or deep bifurcations of the pathogen population, where a sub-set of the population moves in one
antigenic (and genetic) direction and another subset
moves in another antigenic direction. Typically, this
bifurcation leads to stable coexistence of multiple
lineages, despite the presence of strong immune pressure on the viral population. Any epidemiological explanation of influenza A dynamics must simultaneously
generate strong immune pressure, while preventing prolonged bifurcation of the influenza population.
In this study, we have shown that observed patterns of
population turnover corroborate patterns of antigenic
change from 2000 to 2008. In particular, an epidemiological model of influenza must be able to generate periods of relative antigenic stasis and increasing genetic
diversity, as observed from 2000 to 2002, but also periods of sustained antigenic change and consistently low
genetic diversity, as observed from 2004 to 2008. The
results here provide partial support for the idea that
periodic selective sweeps can play a role in the low
diversity of flu (as evidenced by the Fujian/02 transition)
[10], but they also suggest that these sweeps are not
necessary and cannot be the only mechanism at play
(given the diversity results for 2004-2008). Thus, even if
transitions between antigenic clusters play a strong role
in shaping longer-term influenza dynamics [10,13], it
appears another force must at times be responsible for
maintaining low diversity in HA. In the limiting case of
epochal evolution, we would expect to see very large
values of Neτ during periods of antigenic stasis indicative
of selective neutrality. However, results for Neτ between
2000 and 2002 strongly suggest that selection is continuously operating in influenza. The strength of selection appears to vary somewhat over time, but its
presence is seen throughout the study period.
Interestingly, none of the existing epidemiological
models that explicitly incorporate both evolution in

Bedford et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:220
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/220

sequence space and selection through immunity and
cross-immunity in phenotypic space appear able to
explain the two different periods observed in the data. A
model with short-lived transcending immunity [7]
would be compatible with the latter but not the former
period; while the opposite would be the case for a
model of epochal evolution which tends to generate
fairly regular intervals of time, and cannot explain constant diversity, between selective sweeps [10]. We propose that future work on the dynamics of the influenza
virus should attempt to replicate the detailed patterns of
population turnover and antigenic evolution, rather than
focusing on the larger scale assessment of general tree
shape. Investigation of the effects of space and the
shape/topology of the genotype-phenotype map should
complement these efforts.

Methods
Sequence data

To examine broad genealogical patterns influenza (Figure 1), sequences belonging to the hemagglutinin (HA)
gene were downloaded from the Influenza Virus
Resource of GenBank [41]. Only non-lab strains possessing at least 900 bases and recorded years of collection
were used. To obtain a more even distribution of samples over time, we further sampled at most 10 sequences
per year from 1968 to 2008, leaving a total of 363
sequences for analysis. Similarly, to ascertain genealogical patterns in measles (Figure 1), we obtained measles
virus sequences belonging to the hemagglutinin (H)
gene from GenBank [42]. Sequences had to be at least
1800 bases and possess dates of collection. Vaccine
strains and strains associated with the persistent disease
manifestation subacute sclerosing panencephalitis
(SSPE) were removed from the analysis. These procedures resulted in 190 sequences for analysis.
For the more detailed analysis of influenza (Figure 8,
Table 2), sequences belonging to the hemagglutinin
(HA) gene were downloaded from the Influenza Virus
Resource of GenBank [41]. Only non-lab strains of at
least 900 bases with fully specified dates (day, month,
year) and countries of origin were used. We restricted
our analysis to sequences dated from 2000 to 2008. We
categorized the resulting samples into 7 geographic
regions (China, Europe, Japan, Oceania, South America,
Southeast Asia and the USA). This resulted in 3399
samples. Due to data gathering procedures, these data
are biased towards recent samples and towards samples
from the USA and New Zealand. Thus, we sought a
more equitable sampling distribution by further sampling at most 5 sequences at random for each month in
each region. This procedures smoothed out differences
in temporal and spatial sampling patterns, resulting in a
final tally of 1270 sequences. To control for spatial

Page 14 of 16

effects, we replicated the analysis for sequences
restricted to China and Southeast Asia. Here, we
sampled at most 15 sequences per month in each
region. This procedure left 624 sequences for analysis.
In all cases, sequences were aligned using MUSCLE
v3.7 under default parameters [43].
Population genetic simulations

An evolving population of sequences was simulated
according to a haploid Wright-Fisher model with discrete generations. A Moran model may be more analogous to an evolving pathogen population. However, it
has been shown that the Wright-Fisher and Moran
models are completely equivalent with a 2× rescaling of
generations [16]. Each sequence was 2000 bases (chosen
as ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘G’ or ‘T’) in length. We used a Jukes-Cantor
mutation model with a mutation rate of 10 -5 per site
and per generation. In each subsequent generation, the
population was reconstituted by sampling sequences
with replacement proportional to their frequency multiplied by their fitness. Mutations affected fitness in a
multiplicative fashion (additive on a log-scale). The proportion of mutations that had selective impact and the
strength of this impact were varied between simulations.
All simulations were run for 5 × 104 generations before
logging any samples. Sequences were sampled at random time points after this period of ‘burn-in.’ Simulation source code and executables are available from the
authors upon request.
Coalescent inference

Evolutionary dynamics were estimated using a Bayesian
coalescent model that describes the genealogical relationships among observed sequences. This model is
evaluated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).
MCMC explores the parameter-space through a random
walk, converging on the posterior distribution of the
model parameters. Evolutionary parameters and genealogical trees were estimated using the MCMC techniques implemented in the coalescent inference program
BEAST v1.6.0 [25]. Here, trees are constructed following
a coalescent process, which imposes a prior on the
branch lengths of the tree. We used the GTR model of
nucleotide evolution to parameterize the mutational
process, with the evolutionary rate across sites held constant. Each relative rate parameter in the GTR model
was assumed to follow a non-informative Jeffreys prior.
The overall mutation rate μ was assumed to follow a
uniform prior distribution. A piece-wise skyline population model with 10 discrete sizes model was assumed
[44]. The same model was used for all three simulated
datasets and for both influenza datasets. Each population size parameter was assumed to follow a Jeffreys
prior. Each MCMC chain was run for 40 million steps

Bedford et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:220
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/220

with the first 20 million steps discarded as ‘burn-in.’
Samples were logged every 10,000 steps, providing a
total of 2000 samples for each analysis.
Genealogical trees sampled by BEAST were analyzed
using the software package PACT v0.9.3 (source code
available from the author’s website at http://www.trevorbedford.com/pact). Posterior ‘skyline plots’ of descriptive
statistics TMRCA and diversity were produced by taking a
series of temporal slices of lineages. At each point in time,
this slice produces a subtree consisting of only ancestral
lineages. This procedures transforms a genealogy with
temporal spacing of tips into a genealogy with tips at only
a single point of time. For each subtree, we then calculated
the depth of the common ancestor (TMRCA) and the
mean branch distance between pairs of tips (diversity).
Our calculation of the Neτ statistic differs from the calculation of the ‘classic skyline plot’ [23] and also the ‘generalized skyline plot’ [24]. In our implementation, we take a
fixed windows of time and calculate the opportunity for
coalescence in this window and divide this opportunity by
number of coalescent events observed to yield Neτ. To
arrive at the opportunity for coalescence we find coalescent intervals [16] and calculate:
opportunity =
i

tn(n − 1)
,
2

where n is the number of concurrent lineages, t is the
length of the interval and i represents the discrete set of
intervals. If n equals 0 or 1, then the opportunity in this
interval is 0. The sliding window width was chosen to
optimize temporal resolution while leaving enough data
in each window to keep the credible interval sufficiently
narrow. We chose windows of 50 generations for the
simulation studies and 0.25 years for the influenza analysis to accomplish this. Using smaller windows results
in a ‘bumpier’ time-series with wider credible intervals
and using larger windows results in a smoother timeseries with narrower credible intervals. Our basic results
are robust to choice in window size. Each calculation
was run on all 2000 sampled genealogies and from the
distribution of results, means and 95% credible intervals
were obtained.
Genealogical trees were drawn using the program
PACT. Each tree shown represents the sample with the
highest posterior probability in the MCMC analysis.
