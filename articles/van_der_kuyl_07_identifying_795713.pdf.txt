Abstract
Transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is no exception to the phenomenon that a
second, productive infection with another strain of the same virus is feasible. Experiments with
RNA viruses have suggested that both coinfections (simultaneous infection with two strains of a
virus) and superinfections (second infection after a specific immune response to the first infecting
strain has developed) can result in increased fitness of the viral population. Concerns about dual
infections with HIV are increasing. First, the frequent detection of superinfections seems to indicate
that it will be difficult to develop a prophylactic vaccine. Second, HIV-1 superinfections have been
associated with accelerated disease progression, although this is not true for all persons. In fact,
superinfections have even been detected in persons controlling their HIV infections without
antiretroviral therapy. Third, dual infections can give rise to recombinant viruses, which are
increasingly found in the HIV-1 epidemic. Recombinants could have increased fitness over the
parental strains, as in vitro models suggest, and could exhibit increased pathogenicity. Multiple drug
resistant (MDR) strains could recombine to produce a pan-resistant, transmittable virus.
We will describe in this review what is presently known about super- and re-infection among
ambient viral infections, as well as the first cases of HIV-1 superinfection, including HIV-1 triple
infections. The clinical implications, the impact of the immune system, and the effect of antiretroviral therapy will be covered, as will as the timing of HIV superinfection. The methods used
to detect HIV-1 dual infections will be discussed in detail. To increase the likelihood of detecting a
dual HIV-1 infection, pre-selection of patients can be done by serotyping, heteroduplex mobility
assays (HMA), counting the degenerate base codes in the HIV-1 genotyping sequence, or surveying
unexpected increases in the viral load during follow-up. The actual demonstration of dual infections
involves a great deal of additional research to completely characterize the patient's viral
quasispecies. The identification of a source partner would of course confirm the authenticity of the
second infection.

Review
Some confusion surrounds the earliest nomenclature of
viral dual, co-, super- and re-infections, especially with
regard to HIV-1. By now, it has been more or less agreed
upon that viral co-infection is a double infection occur-

ring before antibodies are detectable in the blood (before
seroconversion), and that a double infection is called
superinfection when the second infection takes place after
seroconversion. Double infections of unknown timing are
referred to as dual infections, while the term reinfection is

reserved for a new infection once an initial infection has
been cleared. Due to the persistence of HIV-1 infection,
reinfections as defined above do not occur as the first virus
is never cleared. This review will focus on double HIV-1
infections with special emphasis on superinfections, as
they have attracted the most attention from an immunologic and clinical point of view.

families

interferes with subsequent viral entry of the cell and with
reverse transcription of simple retroviruses such as murine
leukaemia virus. The env protein is most likely involved in
blocking subsequent access to receptors. More intricate
systems involving accessory proteins are implicated in SIR
in complex retroviruses such as feline leukaemia virus and
HIV. Many retroviruses down-regulate the viral receptor
on the cell surface, but this is probably not the main
mechanism of SIR for HIV.

Contrary to popular belief that primary infection of an
organism with a virus prevents the entry of a closely
related virus, this is often not the case. In fact, the entry by
the virus into the host is not prevented, but viral growth
and the severity of clinical symptoms is reduced. The
adaptive immune response is now primed for the incoming pathogen, commonly averting its spread and limiting
subsequent damage. Thus, the strength of the response
determines the precise outcome of the second infection.
This principle applies both to viruses that are cleared and
those that persist in the body such as retroviruses and herpesviruses. Superinfections with herpesviruses have been
documented for herpes simplex virus type 1 [1], herpes
simplex virus type 2 [2], Epstein-Barr virus [3], varicellazoster virus (reviewed in [4]), cytomegalovirus [5-7] and
human herpesvirus 8 [8]. Superinfections with hepatitis B
virus (HBV) have also been reported, e.g. in 0.8% of
chronic HBV carriers and in 1.9% of patients with acute
exacerbations in Taiwan [9]. For hepatitis C virus, a virus
that can be cleared, both co-, super- and reinfections have
been documented (reviewed in [10]). Coinfection with
retroviruses HTLV-I (human T-cell lymphotropic virus
type I) and HTLV-II (human T-cell lymphotropic virus
type II) has been reported in a Brazilian AIDS patient [11],
but very little has been published about co- or superinfection with a same HTLV type. Dual infection with both
HIV-1 and HIV-2 has already been described early in the
HIV epidemic [12-14], and this finding is common in
West Africa with a prevalence of 24% in HIV-infected
female sex workers from Ivory Coast [15] to 40.4% in
seropositive individuals from Senegal [16]. Dual infections with different strains of HIV-2 have not been
described so far. In contrast, dual infections with distinct
HIV-1 strains are prevalent, and form the focus of this
review.

HIV-1 superinfection: the first cases

Even for viruses that persist, many uninfected cells in the
host are available for infection by a second viral strain. At
the cellular level, superinfection of a single cell can be prevented by a phenomenon called "superinfection resistance" (SIR). Hence, the first infecting virus actively
prevents re-infection of the same cell after a short time
window, usually in the range of 4–24 hrs (reviewed in
[17]). The molecular mechanism of SIR has been revealed
in some cases. Expression of env and gag genes in a cell

HIV-1 triple infections

The possibility of HIV-1 superinfection was not taken seriously for a long time, probably because the chances of
acquiring a single HIV-1 infection were estimated to be
low, not only for the general population but for most risk
groups as well. Furthermore, it was assumed that an initial
HIV-1 infection could protect against a secondary infection, as an idealized vaccine might do. Subsequently, the
wealth of recombinant viruses that were detected worldwide provided the first indications that HIV-1 dual infections occur frequently, since recombinant viruses can only
arise in doubly infected individuals. These dual infections
were suspected to represent HIV-1 coinfections (i.e. both
events occurring before HIV-1 adaptive immunity is established). However, as early as 1987, it was shown that
superinfection of chimpanzees with HIV-1 by intravenous
injection of a distinct strain could be achieved 6–15
months after the initial infection. Nonetheless, it was not
until 2002 that the first reports of HIV-1 superinfection in
humans appeared [18-20].
In three separate cases, patients were superinfected with
distinct subtypes of HIV-1. In a report by Ramos et al., two
intravenous drug users were superinfected with
CRF01_AE (CRF = Circulating Recombinant Form) and
subtype B after initial infection with subtype B and
CRF01_AE, respectively [18]. In the report by Jost et al. a
male having sex with men was superinfected with subtype
B after a first infection with CRF01_AE [19]. In the paper
by Altfeld et al., both the first and second virus were subtype B strains [20]. Thus up to 2005, 17 case reports of
HIV-1 superinfection have been published (reviewed in
[21,22]), and a few more cases have appeared in print
since 2005 [23-29]. HIV-1 superinfection cases have also
been identified in larger population studies [30-35].

To date, four patients have been described who were
infected with three HIV-1 strains. Two patients were African women: a Cameroonian woman infected with a group
O virus, a subtype D virus, and a subtype A/G recombinant virus [36,37]; and a patient from Tanzania infected
with two subtype A strains and a subtype C virus or recombinants thereof [38]. In these women, however, it could
not be established whether the triple infections were the

result of coinfections or superinfections, or both. An intravenous drug user from Spain ultimately was found to
carry three HIV-1 subtype B strains following a dual superinfection twelve years after primo infection [25]. Repeated
superinfection was also documented for a homosexual
man from the Netherlands, who was infected by a subtype
B strain approximately one year after initial infection with
another subtype B strain, and then with CRF01_AE one
year after the second infection [24,39].

Infection with a drug-resistant virus strain severely hinders
antiviral treatment options, and this is ultimately the outcome in patients infected with two MDR strains. In these
cases, recombination could lead to a pan-resistant virus
that cannot be treated with existing antiretroviral drugs.
That such a scenario is feasible is illustrated by a case from
the United States, in which a patient harbouring two MDR
strains transmitted a highly drug-resistant recombinant
virus [27].

From this small number of reports, it can be concluded
that infection with more than two HIV-1 strains and especially serial superinfection are rare events, which are not
impossible in high risk patients. Recombinant HIV-1
strains were detected in all the above four patients, but in
only one patient were viral genomes detected that mix
fragments from all three strains [37]. Nevertheless, these
case reports suggest that multiply infected patients could
contribute to the HIV-1 viral diversity through the generation of complex recombinant viruses.

Viral sex: are HIV-1 recombinants taking over?

HIV-1 superinfections and anti-retroviral
therapy
Antiretroviral therapy is now commonly used in developed countries and increasingly used in the developing
world. It is generally assumed, but not well established,
that the incidence of HIV-1 superinfection in individuals
under therapy is low, and case reports in those settings are
indeed rare [27]. A productive infection will be difficult to
establish as the incoming virus will immediately experience the pressure of antiretroviral drugs. No superinfections were detected during follow-up of 14 HIV-infected
couples who practised high-risk behaviour, while being
treated with antiretroviral drugs [40]. Despite therapy, the
plasma viral load was always measurable in these patients.
To facilitate detection of superinfection in this study, couples were chosen in which partners carried different HIV
strains.
Some superinfections have been reported to occur during
treatment interruptions [19,20] This is explained possibly
because antiviral immune responses decrease during therapy. Eight superinfections have been reported which
involve drug-resistant HIV-1 strains, either as the first
[23,30,41] or the second [26,30] infecting virus. In some
cases both viruses were found to carry (multiple) drugresistance mutations [27,42]. One of the patients twice
received a multidrug resistant (MDR) strain while not on
therapy. When assessed, the replicative capacity of the
drug-resistant variants was often [26,41,42], but not
always [23] reduced compared to that of wild type, parental HIV-1 strains. Thus, superinfections can sometimes
result in the introduction and outgrowth of a virus strain
with greater fitness.

Recombination between HIV-1 genomes is an important
viral evolutionary strategy (for reviews, see [43,44]), as it
substantially enlarges the diversity of viral quasispecies
within a patient [39,45]. The two copies of the RNA
genome incorporated in the virus particle make HIV-1 a
"diploid" virus, whereby recombinant offspring's can be
produced during replication, in a manner resembling sexual reproduction. Recombinant viruses found in an epidemic can either be intra-patient [45], intra-subtype [46],
or inter-subtype. In the latter two settings, infection of an
initial patient with two different virus strains is a prerequisite for the formation of offspring recombinants. Intersubtype HIV-1 recombinants, which are the most easy to
identify, have been detected since the early days of the epidemic (see e.g. [47]), suggesting that multiply infected
patients were present early on. For some of the strains initially classified as recombinant viruses, there has been
doubt raised about their recombinant status [48], but it is
obvious that many recombinant strains are circulating
worldwide.
More than 20% of the current HIV-1 infections in Africa
are estimated to represent recombinant strains [49]. Mathematical models indicate that a limited superinfection
incidence can nevertheless lead to a high prevalence of
recombinant viruses if there is a small core group of
highly sexually active people and a large group of low-risk
individuals [49,50]. Indeed, a higher frequency of both
dual infections and recombinant strains was found in a
high-risk group of bar workers in Tanzania compared to a
normal-risk population of antenatal care attendees and
blood donors [51]. As transmissions from these high-risk
populations are likely to be frequent, it can be anticipated
that HIV-1 recombinant strains will continue to expand in
the HIV-1 epidemic.
This primitive sexual reproduction system might be an
effective strategy for retroviruses to adapt to evolutionary
constraints posed by the invasion into novel host species
in the face of an error-prone viral reverse transcriptase
enzyme. For vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), an RNA
virus, superinfection promotes faster adaptation than single infections [52,53]. A higher fitness of VSV populations
was reached after coinfection than after superinfection,

but both conditions created viruses with a higher relative
fitness than those arising from single infections [53]. The
authors explain this phenomenon through maximized
competition for host resources between diverse populations by coinfection, whereby the fastest growing genotype from the whole genetic pool emerges, and through
density-dependent selection by superinfection. Ignoring
immune pressure, virus dynamics are affected in this latter
model by at least three factors: the rate of exponential
growth of the initial virus population, the initial decline
of the population size for the secondary virus, and the
finite duration of the infection passages. However, the
strength of these factors reduces as the time interval
between infections decreases, and adaptation is thus maximal if the time interval is zero, which equals a coinfection. Thus, in the superinfection model, the second virus
swarm might contain a better competitor than any genotype present in the resident population, but the success
rate of the second infecting virus is strongly contextdependent.

Superinfection and the immune system
It is not clear whether specific host factors play a role in a
productive superinfection. It has been assumed that an
HIV-1 coinfection, that is a second infection before antiHIV antibodies are detectable, can always occur, unlike a
superinfection. It is likely that the adaptive immune
response plays a major role in preventing a superinfection
from becoming productive. It has been speculated that the
lack of heterologous neutralizing antibodies predisposes
the host for superinfection, as three superinfected patients
showed less cross-protective and neutralizing antibody
response to both autologous and heterologous HIV-1
than non-superinfected controls [54]. The authors speculated that two of their control patients with low neutralizing antibody titers should be equally susceptible to
superinfection, but were less exposed. Lack of cross-neutralizing antibodies was also observed in two superinfection cases in injecting drug users from Thailand [18].
By contrast, CD8+ T-cells seem to play a less important
role in protection against superinfection. A patient with
strong and broadly reactive CD8+ T-cell responses that
inhibit HIV-1 replication was found to be superinfected
with another subtype B strain several years after the initial
infection [20]. In this patient, neutralizing antibody
responses to the autologous virus were weak before superinfection, as observed in other studies [18,54]; and they
were not cross-reactive against the second virus. Yet, neutralizing antibody responses were measured during a
period of antiretroviral treatment interruption when antiviral immunity can be expected to be low; although the
CD8+ T-cell responses were powerful during that same
period [20]. A later study also described a patient with an
initially effective CD8+ T-cell response that successfully

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/67

controlled HIV-1 replication without antiviral treatment
before he became superinfected with a second subtype B
strain [23]. In horses infected with equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV, a lentivirus infecting equines), the situation seems to be the reverse. EIAV carrier horses can resist
challenge with a heterologous strain in the absence of
detectable cross-neutralizing antibody response to the
heterologous virus [55]. Some horses immunized with an
inactivated virus vaccine also resisted homologous strain
challenge without detectable levels of neutralizing antibodies, but they did show virus-specific cell-mediated
immune responses [56].
Thus, from the limited studies on adaptive immunity, it
can be cautiously concluded that neutralizing antibody
responses play a more significant role in preventing HIV1 superinfection than CTL-responses.

Clinical implications of HIV-1 dual infections
The first reports on HIV dual infections suggested an association of such findings with accelerated disease progression, particularly with clinical parameters such as a rise in
the plasma viral load and a decline of the CD4+ T-cell
numbers [19,57,58]. Alternatively, dual infections with
fast disease progression may simply have been spotted
earlier. In a doubly superinfected patient, the first superinfection was not associated with disease progression (as
implied by stable CD4+ T cell counts above 500 cells/ml),
while the second superinfection resulted in a permanent
increase in the plasma viral load and a significant reduction in CD4+ T cells [24]. In another longitudinal study,
HIV-1 superinfection was associated with rapid CD4+ T
cell decline and an increased plasma viral load, necessitating the start of HAART four months later; however, in a
second patient there was no decline of CD4+ T cells nor
persistently increased viral load after HIV-1 superinfection
([59] and unpublished data). That some individuals are
more susceptible to superinfection because they somehow lack factors to contain HIV-1 infection was hypothesized in a patient with rapid progression to AIDS [29].
This patient was superinfected with a dual-tropic (both
CCR5 and CXCR4-using) HIV-1 strain 0.8–1.3 years after
seroconversion that rapidly became the predominant
virus strain [29]. Retrospectively, it was shown that the
rapid CD4+ cell decline experienced by this patient preceded his superinfection. This suggests that fast disease
progression was not completely due to a second infection
with a more virulent virus, and that the already failing
immune system facilitated a new HIV-1 infection. A schematic representation of HIV-1 superinfection relative to
the different stages of the infection and the plasma viral
load is shown in Fig. 1.
In a cohort study of African women infected with subtype
C strains, dual infection was associated with an elevated

HIV infection is characterized by an acute phase with a high
viral load, which decreases as specific immunity develops
(solid line). After seroconversion (SC), the chronic phase of
the infection starts, lasting several years. The chronic phase
of the infection is traditionally followed by the AIDS phase,
but is now increasingly replaced by the start of antiretroviral
therapy (ART) in many parts of the world. An HIV-1 dual
infection during the acute phase is called a co-infection, after
seroconversion it is referred to as a superinfection. HIV-1
superinfections often result in an increase, sometimes temporary, of the viral load (dotted line) and an earlier start of
therapy. HIV-1 superinfections in most cases are found close
to the acute infection, and only rarely occur later than a few
years after primary infection.

viral setpoint [60]. Remarkably, two studies on HIV-1
controllers (also known as long-term non-progressors)
indicated that HIV-1 dual infections are present in this
patient group, but without obvious disease progression
[35,61]. In one of these patients, a superinfection without
any clinical deterioration occurred nine years after primoinfection, which had shown excellent immune control of
the first virus [61].
Taken together, these studies suggest that HIV-1 dual
infections are frequently, but not always, associated with
accelerated disease progression. Due to the lack of longterm systematic investigations in a cohort setting, it is currently unclear whether HIV-1 co- and superinfections
have different effects on disease development.

Detection of dual infections
The detection and verification of HIV dual infections
require extensive laboratory analyses, and it is vital that
the appropriate blood samples are available. Dual infections can easily be missed, because the second infection

can be transient with a very low level of virus replication
[31]. There can be severe fluctuations in the relative
amounts of the two viruses in subsequent plasma samples
[38], which is a problem if only a single sample is analysed. Recombination can happen and the recombinant
virus can outgrow parental strains, which would thus be
missed [62,63]. PCR primers can be too selective, such
that they do not recognize a second HIV-1 strain. It is,
therefore, highly desirable that serial patient samples are
available, especially from early moments, to increase the
likelihood of detecting a dual infection. Very early in coinfections, we sometimes see the fast outgrowth of a single
strain, with the second virus then being absent from all
subsequent samples (unpublished results). One difficulty
with analysis is that the second virus should not be too
closely related to the first; otherwise the former will not
appear as a distinct strain in a phylogenetic analysis, making it impossible to distinguish between virus evolution
and superinfection. This phenomenon severely restricts
the identification of novel transmissions from the same
donor.
An assumed dual infection should be verified by sequencing the patient's viral quasi-species. Thus, detecting dual
infections involves numerous analyses, and selecting the
right group of higher-risk patients might be essential
when planning large studies. Some options are available
to identify patients with potential dual infections (Table
1). Serotyping based upon enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) which discern between HIV-1 group M
(subtype B or non-B), HIV-1 group O, HIV-1 group N, and
HIV-2 infections have been used to identify dual group M
and O infections [36,62,64-67] and an HIV-1/HIV-2 dual
infection [68]. Nonetheless, serotyping is not a means to
detect HIV intra-subtype dual infections, as this method
lacks discriminatory power. Caution is also warranted
when using inter-subtype serotyping assays. Although
specificity is generally high, discordant results have been
observed [69], and not all dually reactive specimens are
due to dual infection [70]. Heteroduplex mobility assay
(HMA) analysis is a relatively fast and sensitive method to
screen PCR amplification products for the presence of
divergent sequences [34,60,71,72]. It is again important
that early control samples are available. After initial selection by serotyping or HMA, PCR amplification, cloning
and sequencing are necessary to confirm dual HIV infection.
We recently described an easy method to detect dual infections that is based on the routine HIV-1 genotyping
method, a population sequencing method [73]. Protease/
reverse transcriptase (prot/RT) sequencing is routinely
performed in the Western world to assess drug resistance
mutations. If the sequences are derived from a heterogeneous population of viral DNA fragments, heterogeneous

positions will show up in the sequencing electropherogram as a double or triple peak, and will be assigned a
degenerate base code. Degenerate base codes are codes for
incompletely specified bases in nucleic acid sequences as
recommended by the Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry and the International Union of Biochemistry and
Molecular Biology (IUPAC-IUBMB) that signify double (R
= A or G; Y = C or T; K = G or T; M = A or C; S = G or C; W
= A or T), triple (e.g. B = C, G, or T; D = A, C, or T; H = A,
C, or T; V = A, C, or G) or quadruple (N = A, C, T, or G)
bases in a DNA sequence [74]. From the polymerase gene
sequences that yielded a high score of degenerate base
codes, we measured a high percentage of dual infections.
If the number of degenerate base codes in the reverse transcriptase (RT) fragment of the polymerase sequence is 34
or more, 43% of patients were confirmed to be dually
infected [73]. This percentage rose to 73% when degenerate base codes in RT increased to 45 or more. In the other
patients, heterogeneity could be ascribed to massive viral
evolution. Figure 2 shows the variation of degenerate base
counts in RT over time in a patient twice superinfected
with HIV-1. From this example it is apparent that a superinfection can easily be missed when testing only a single
sample, as during the acute phase of the second superinfection when most of the viral RNA originated from the
incoming virus, and thus no heterogeneity was detected in
the RT sequence.

nied by a steep rise in the plasma viral load. The first HIV1 superinfections in patients were identified mainly
because of such unexplained viral load increases
[19,20,22,24]. In 5 chronically infected intravenous drug
users with an unexpected rise in the viraemia, 2 experienced a superinfection with a different HIV-1 subtype
[31]. A study of untreated patients experiencing a sudden
rise in the plasma viral load indicated a superinfection in
2 out of 14 patients [59].

attributed to viral evolution and not to dual infection. For
definite proof of HIV superinfection, some scientists consider it essential to couple the sequences from a suspected
superinfection case to those of an identified source partner. This can also be done by phylogenetic analysis of viral
sequences. However, in many cases, especially with anonymous sexual contacts, the source will not be easy to identify. Sometimes, an indication of transmission may be
retrieved from sequence databases [27,79-82].

The only method currently available to detect some dual
infections without further sequence analysis is the Multiregion Hybridization Assay (MHA), which is based on
real-time PCR amplification of multiple genomic fragments, using and subtype-specific probes for detection.
These MHA's can only be used in areas were multiple subtypes prevail, such as in Africa [75] or Asia [76], and will
obviously miss intrasubtype dual infections. The success
rate of the different pre-selection methods as calculated
from published studies is variable (Table 1). Overall, the
number of degenerate bases in RT is the best predictor of
an HIV-1 dual infection, followed by HMA analysis. Dual
reactivity in serological assays (serotyping) is highly predictable of intergroup dual HIV-1 infections, but intragroup predictability is limited [70]. Using no pre-selection
method results in very low success rates, as dual infections
are relatively uncommon in all cohorts examined.

Timing of HIV superinfection

No matter what method was used to pre-select a suspected
HIV dual infection, actual confirmation requires a phylogenetic analysis of viral sequences. To construct such a
phylogenetic tree, several methods are available (see e.g.
[77]). The neighbour-joining (NJ) method and, more
recently, Bayesian inference of phylogeny, an approach
similar to maximum-likelihood, are often used in HIV
evolution studies [78]. Whatever the method used to construct the tree, it is important that some statistical significance is given to the branching of sequences. With the NJ
method, this is commonly done by applying a bootstrapping algorithm to the tree. For Bayesian trees, posterior
probabilities can be calculated. Bootstrap numbers of 80
or over and posterior probabilities of 0.8–1.0 are generally taken as positive evidence for the accuracy of a cluster
of sequences.
We outlined earlier [73] a number of criteria for the positive identification of HIV-1 dual infection based upon
sequence analysis that should be true with two distinct
phylogenetic methods: 1. Sequences of a single patient
should cluster independently, or 2. Sequences of a patient
cluster together, but the bootstrap/posterior probability
value connecting the branches should be low (values
under 80/0.8 are normally considered insignificant).
Divergent sequence groups from a patient that cluster
together with high confidence levels should always be

Superinfections have been described after long-term
chronic infection [25], but the most optimal period for a
second infection seems restricted to a window period of
less than 3 years after the initial infection (see also [49]).
The first few months after primary infection appear therefore to be the most favourable for superinfection. Such a
window was described for macaques infected with simian
immunodeficiency virus or HIV-2, although in monkeys
the time of susceptibility to a second infection appears to
be even shorter; no more than a few weeks after the first
infection [83-88]. This uneven distribution of susceptibility to HIV superinfection suggests that the immune system
is an important player in the defence against superinfection. As the adaptive immune response is usually in place
within a few weeks to months after initial infection, it can
be reasoned that in some patients either an effective
immune response takes longer to mature, or that the
immune system is quickly deteriorating, allowing a superinfection, or that other factors play a decisive role. Cellular
and viral kinetics are also important for the susceptibility
to and the timing of HIV-1 superinfection.
From studies of macaques infected with SIV it became
clear that a main target site of SIV infection is the gut-associated lymphoid tissue [89]. At the acute stage, a massive
infection and subsequent destruction of 60–80% of memory CD4+ T cells takes place in the mucosa and lymph
nodes, with initially little effect upon the peripheral blood
CD4+ T cell numbers, mainly because local memory
CD4+ T cell numbers are low [89-91]. Subsequently,
CD4+ T cells from other compartments travel to the
mucosa to replenish the lost T cells, and peripheral blood
CD4+ T cells slowly start to decline. These findings were
confirmed in HIV-1 infected humans [92]. Initiation of
HAART early in HIV infection resulted in a near-complete
restoration of intestinal CD4+ T cells, but this was not the
case if HAART is started during chronic infection. So how
can HIV-1 superinfection occur when its main target cells
are largely gone, and unlikely to return? Several factors
could play a role. In macaques, the relative virulence of
the infecting strain was associated with the rapidity and
degree of T cell depletion in the intestine [89]. Infecting
monkeys with the SIVmac239∆nef straindid not result in
a significant depletion of intestinal CD4+ T cells [89]. In

Retrovirology 2007, 4:67

humans, long-term nonprogressors were found to maintain normal CD4+ T cell numbers not only in peripheral
blood, but also in the intestinal mucosa [93]. This suggests that both viral and host factors determine the extent
of initial memory CD4+ T cell depletion in the host, and
thus the susceptibility to HIV-1 superinfection. Sufficient
memory CD4+ T cells to support a second HIV-1 infection
should thus remain in patients infected with a less virulent virus, in patients efficiently controlling their HIV-1
infection (long-term nonprogressors), and in individuals
who have started HAART very early in infection. Besides,
it is possible that the 20–40% of memory CD4+ T cells
that are left uninfected in the mucosal tissues of the average patient is enough to support a second HIV-1 infection,
especially if new CD4+ T cells are recruited to these tissues.

Are HIV-1 superinfections increasing?
A major risk factor to acquire a second HIV infection is
risk exposure, which itself consists of two aspects: risky
behaviour and HIV-1 prevalence. Decreasing risky behaviour and the absence of HIV infected individuals surrounding the patient will diminish the frequency of HIV
superinfections. If the HIV infection rate is relatively high,
such as in areas where the epidemic is well established,
then HIV dual infection rate will be higher than in regions
where HIV was introduced more recently. This is reflected
in studies in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV is highly prevalent in most populations, with many people demonstrating high risk behaviour. A study published in 2004 on
HIV-1 dual infection in a cohort of commercial sex workers in Burkina Faso found that 2 out of 147 women were
dually infected [34]. A similar study in South Africa, published in 2004, showed that within 3 months of infection,
19% (6 out of 31) of female sex workers were dually
infected with distinct subtype C viruses [60]. Among
female bar workers in Kenya, who are less exposed than
sex workers, three cases of HIV-1 superinfection were
detected in 20 persons examined (15%), suggesting that
HIV-1 superinfection occurs as commonly as primary
infections [33]. In a similar risk group of bar workers in
Tanzania, 19% of dual HIV-1 infections were seen, compared with 9% in the normal risk population of antenatal
care attendees and blood donors [51]. These figures correlate well with the HIV-1 prevalence data from the countries involved [94]. HIV prevalence is the lowest in
Burkina Faso (4.2% among the adult population in 2004,
of which 88% HIV-1 and 12% HIV-2), intermediate in
Kenya (7.4% among adults in 2004) and Tanzania (6.4–
11.9% in 2003), and highest in South Africa with an estimated prevalence of 17.8–24.3% among the adult population in 2003.
Apart from heterosexual contacts, HIV-1 can be transmitted in several other ways. Among intravenous drug users

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/67

(IDUs), the virus can be injected directly into the blood
stream by means of used needles, providing an easy
opportunity for infection as no mucosal barriers need to
be taken. One would expect that the likelihood of productive superinfection is high in this risk group. In one cohort
study of IDUs in Switzerland, 3 coinfections were found
among 58 seroconverters [31]. At a later time point, 1 of
40 (2.5%) of these seroconverters superinfected. In a similar study in Thailand, no dual infection was seen among
126 seroconverting IDUs [32]. During follow-up a year
later, 2 of 80 (2.5%) IDUs had acquired an HIV-1 superinfection, a number that is very similar to that of the Swiss
cohort. In contrast, none of 37 IDUs with high-risk behaviour was superinfected during the 1987–2000 period in
the San Francisco Bay area [95]. Similarly, no HIV-1 superinfections were detected in 9 Brazilian IDUs with continuing high-risk practices [96]. These numbers indicate a
similar rate of HIV-1 dual infections in IDU cohorts when
compared to African heterosexual cohorts. The absence of
superinfections in the latter two groups may be due to a
low incidence or the availability of effective therapy measures, although use of HAART was infrequent in the Brazilian study. A mathematical analysis suggested that 9% of
new infections among IDU in Thailand represent superinfections [97].
No systematic studies on the prevalence of HIV-1 dual
infections in exclusively homosexual cohorts have been
performed. It could be imagined that the frequency of
dual infections will be different, as the transmission route
for men having sex with men is dissimilar from heterosexual or IDUs, as is perhaps also the risk behaviour. Two
large studies were performed on HIV-1 infected patients in
Western Europe and the USA, with the majority being
men having sex with men. A few larger studies have also
been published to date. In 2003, the analysis of prot/RT
sequences of 718 patients in San Francisco with at least
two sampling moments and persistent viraemia during
therapy showed that in none of these patients therapy failure was due to a HIV-1 superinfection [98]. In this study,
degenerate base codes in the prot/RT sequence, representing viral mixtures, were artificially assigned a distance
value to calculate nucleotide distances between serial
samples. A large nucleotide distance between samples was
taken as evidence for an HIV-1 superinfection. In addition, phylogenetic trees were constructed whereby monophyletic clustering of sequences from a single patient
supposedly indicated evolution from a common ancestor,
whereas paraphyletic clustering should imply HIV-1
superinfection. The HIV-1 prot/RT sequences routinely
determined both at baseline and following therapy failure
were used in a study in the Netherlands [73]. Patients were
selected for further analysis based on the number of
degenerate base codes in the RT fragment of this sequence.
Additional sequence analysis confirmed that 16 of 37

(42%) patients had a dual HIV-1 infection, equalling 1%
of the total 1661 records available. Another extensive survey of 660 HIV-1 seroconverters in France with samples
collected from 1988–2004 did not discover any HIV coinfections or early superinfections in these patients using
HMA as initial screening method [72]. In the studies from
San Francisco, the Netherlands, and France, the risk group
and the risk behaviour of the persons were not taken into
account.
From the above studies, it cannot be concluded that the
incidence of HIV-1 co- and superinfections is increasing.
To reliably assess the incidence of HIV dual infections,
additional cohort studies spanning an extended time of
the epidemic are essential; these should encompass discrete risk groups of heterosexual, homosexual and shared
needle transmission. However, it is clear that dual infections are more common in Africa than in the rest of the
world, probably because of the significantly higher HIV-1
prevalence. A second HIV-1 infection occurs apparently as
frequently as the first HIV-1 infection in African cohorts of
heterosexual high risk individuals [33]. Frequent dual
infection is reflected by the large number of recombinant
viruses discovered in Africa, albeit such findings are not
only restricted there [99].
From the studies reviewed above, it can be concluded that
the main risk of HIV superinfection is high risk exposure,
which consists of two components: HIV prevalence and
risk behaviour. Another important factor is time since the
initial infection, and the optimal time for a second infection is close to the initial infection. Viral determinants (fitness), host factors (immune response) and the mode of
transmission seem to play less important roles.
A rise in the number of new HIV infections and other sexually transmitted diseases in men having sex with men has
been reported since the introduction of HAART in the
Western world, suggesting that an increase in HIV superinfections can also be expected in this risk group [100].
Men uninformed of their HIV status and seronegative
men will likely also engage in more risky behaviour due to
the availability of HAART treatment options. An acute
infection can quickly be followed by HIV superinfection
when most patients are still unaware of their HIV status. If
superinfections usually take place close to the acute HIV
infection, public counselling among HIV-infected individuals with known status is not likely to be effective in
terms of prevention. Instead, overall public awareness
campaigns of sexually transmitted disease prevention
should be used to halt HIV superinfections with an
emphasis on persons already infected with HIV to continue safe sex practices. Men having sex with men from
San Francisco, who believed HIV superinfection can occur
and that it damages their health, reported safer sex prac-

http://www.retrovirology.com/content/4/1/67

tices than men who did not believe in superinfection or
did not believe that it could be harmful [101]. Serosorting
(i.e. having unprotected sex only with persons of similar
HIV serostatus) has been used as a HIV prevention strategy. However, serosorting may actually increase the
chance of HIV transmission when partners are not aware
of, or not sincere about, their HIV-1 status [102]. Unprotected sex with positive partners, which is becoming more
and more frequent among HIV infected men having sex
with men [102,103] is likely to boost the incidence of HIV
superinfections, and should thus be discouraged.

Conclusion
HIV-1 co-infection and superinfection are existing phenomena that contribute to viral diversity by the generation of recombinant viruses. The incidence of HIV
superinfections is mainly controlled by risk exposure,
which consists of two aspects: risk behaviour and HIV
prevalence. Control by the immune system, in particular
neutralizing antibodies, probably limits the time window
of an HIV superinfection to the first two years after primary infection. In most, but not all superinfected patients,
the second infection leads to faster disease progression. At
present, it is unclear whether HIV-1 dual infections are
increasing worldwide, but preliminary data from different
cohorts suggest that dual infections increase when HIV-1
prevalence goes up, which is consistent with theoretical
models.
