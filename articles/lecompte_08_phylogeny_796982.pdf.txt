Abstract
Background: Within the subfamily Murinae, African murines represent 25% of species biodiversity, making this
group ideal for detailed studies of the patterns and timing of diversification of the African endemic fauna and its
relationships with Asia. Here we report the results of phylogenetic analyses of the endemic African murines
through a broad sampling of murine diversity from all their distribution area, based on the mitochondrial
cytochrome b gene and the two nuclear gene fragments (IRBP exon 1 and GHR).
Results: A combined analysis of one mitochondrial and two nuclear gene sequences consistently identified and
robustly supported ten primary lineages within Murinae. We propose to formalize a new tribal arrangement
within the Murinae that reflects this phylogeny. The diverse African murine assemblage includes members of five
of the ten tribes and clearly derives from multiple faunal exchanges between Africa and Eurasia. Molecular dating
analyses using a relaxed Bayesian molecular clock put the first colonization of Africa around 11 Mya, which is
consistent with the fossil record. The main period of African murine diversification occurred later following
disruption of the migration route between Africa and Asia about 7–9 Mya. A second period of interchange, dating
to around 5–6.5 Mya, saw the arrival in Africa of Mus (leading to the speciose endemic Nannomys), and explains
the appearance of several distinctive African lineages in the late Miocene and Pliocene fossil record of Eurasia.
Conclusion: Our molecular survey of Murinae, which includes the most complete sampling so far of African taxa,
indicates that there were at least four separate radiations within the African region, as well as several phases of
dispersal between Asia and Africa during the last 12 My. We also reconstruct the phylogenetic structure of the
Murinae, and propose a new classification at tribal level for this traditionally problematic group.

Background
Rodents are the most speciose mammalian order and
comprise almost half of all mammalian species diversity
[1]. Within Rodentia, the most diverse assemblage is the
superfamily Muroidea, with a global membership of 1300
living species and a natural distribution that includes all
continents except Antarctica and all but the most remote
islands. This remarkable group also includes the commensal rats and mice, long despised as human pests and
agents of disease [2], but now highly valued as model
organisms for research related to human health [3,4].
Not surprisingly, morphology-based classifications of
muroid rodents were beset by problems of parallel evolution, with many common adaptations evolving independently on different landmasses. Molecular phylogenetic
analyses are much less constrained by this problem and
recent studies using slowly evolving nuclear genes have
done much to clarify the membership and structure of
Muroidea [5-7]. Recent classifications of this group recognize five or six family level lineages [7,8]. The speciose
family Muridae Illiger, 1811 (150 genera and 730 species)
is divided by Musser and Carleton [8] into five subfamilies, of which the Murinae Illiger, 1811 is the most
diversified (126 genera, 561 species). Within the family
Muridae, there is strong molecular support for three subfamilies (Deomyinae, Gerbillinae, Murinae) [subfamily
Leimacomyinae of Musser and Carleton [8] has not yet
been surveyed], and for a link between Deomyinae and
Gerbillinae, with these as a sister clade to Murinae (this
latter subfamily encompassing otomyines) [5-7].
The subfamily Murinae has a natural distribution that
spans the Old World, including all of Africa and Eurasia,
and extending to Australia, New Guinea and many islands
of the western Pacific (we do not consider here the
human-mediated distribution of a few commensal
rodents of the genera Mus and Rattus in the Americas and
throughout oceanic islands). More than 500 species are
currently recognised [8], with centers of diversity and
endemism in each of Tropical Africa, Southeast Asia, and
the Australo-Papuan region [9,10]. Despite the obvious
significance of this group for biogeographic studies, previous molecular studies have either had specific regional
foci (e.g. Africa [11-13]; Philippines: [14]; Australia:
[15,16] ; Eurasia: [17,18]) or employed immunological
methods of uncertain reliability [10]. These studies have
encouraged regionally-based classifications at tribal or
subfamilial level, especially within the Australasian and
Philippine regions where various higher level groupings
are sometimes recognized (e.g. Anisomyini, Conilurini,
Hydromyini, Phloeomyinae, Pseudomyinae, Rhynchomyinae). In Africa, Ducroz et al. [12] designated a
tribe Arvicanthini for one well-supported monophyletic
group. The most recent, global classification of Murinae

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/199

[8] abandons the tribal level of classification in favour of
a less formal arrangement of genera into divisions, following and improving a system already employed by Misonne [9]. Specifically, Musser and Carleton [8] (2005:
pages 902 – 905) organize the 126 genera of the subfamily Murinae into 29 divisions, and consider the living
taxa Myotomys, Otomys, and Parotomys as members of the
subfamily Otomyinae.
Africa supports more than 25% of all living murine species including representatives of 32 endemic genera [8].
All African murines are endemic at species level and only
two genera are shared between Africa and Eurasia. One of
these is the genus Mus, which is widespread across Eurasia
and is represented in Africa by an endemic subgenus, Nannomys, the African pigmy mice [19-21]. The second is the
primarily African genus Myomyscus which has one species
(M. yemeni) native to the Arabian Peninsula. A single origin for all African Murinae, except possibly Dasymys, was
proposed by Watts and Baverstock [22] based on their
analyses of albumin microcomplement fixation. In contrast, Chevret's [23] studies using the DNA/DNA hybridization method found a minimum of three ancient African
lineages within Murinae, each associated with Eurasian
taxa. Later studies using direct sequencing methods supported the notion of polyphyly for African Murinae, e.g.
[12-14,16,24]. Jansa et al. [14] identified three distinct
groups: the 'Arvicanthines' (sensu Ducroz et al. [12]), a
'Praomys group' (sensu Lecompte et al. [25]) and the genus
Malacomys. The 'otomyines', a dentally distinctive African
lineage with three genera (Myotomys, Otomys,Parotomys),
are variously associated in molecular studies with either
the Praomys group [10] or the arvicanthines
[6,11,12,16,24]. Ducroz et al. [12] suggested recognition
of this group at tribal rank, as Otomyini. However, Musser
and Carleton [8] follow more traditional practice by recognizing a distinct subfamily Otomyinae within Muridae.
Numerous questions thus remain unresolved concerning
the pattern and timing of African Murinae diversification.
In particular, the relationships of the various African lineages with Asian genera are enigmatic, and the timing of
most cladogenic events remains poorly resolved or understood. The latter issue is critical to understanding the history of faunal interchange via the Arabian plate following
the collision of Africa with Asia around 16 and 20 Million
years ago (Mya) [26,27]. Notably, the murine palaeontological record attests to the presence of some shared genera in Africa and Asia during the late Miocene and the
Pliocene [28-30], but whether this is due to multiple faunal exchanges between Asia and Africa, to the presence of
ancient shared lineages followed by vicariance, or else to
convergent evolution, remains a matter of conjecture.

To more adequately assess the pattern and timing of faunal exchanges between Africa and Asia, it is necessary to
first establish a more complete phylogenetic framework
including all of the key African and Eurasian lineages, and
then to derive reliable estimates of divergence times. The
main objectives of our study are: (1) to provide a robust
and comprehensive phylogeny of the extant African
murines and to infer their relationships with the Asian
Murinae using mitochondrial and nuclear gene
sequences, (2) to provide a new systematic framework
that accurately reflects the phylogeny of Murinae; (3) to
estimate times of origin and diversification for the African
murines lineages; and (4) to place this phylogeny in an
historical and geographical context to gain insight into the
origin and maintenance of African murine diversity.

The most basal lineage (Lineage 1) consists of the genera
Phloeomys and Batomys, both Philippine endemics.
There is very strong support (100% BP; 1.0 PP) for reciprocal monophyly of Lineage 1 and all other Murinae.
Among the remaining Murinae, the first lineage to diverge
(Lineage 2, 99% BP; 1.0 PP) comprises one largely Southeast Asian clade, the Rattus group sensu lato of Verneau et
al. [31], together with the Eurasian harvest mouse Micromys, again with strong support (99% BP; 1.0 PP). Within
Lineage 2, Micromys is the first lineage to diverge, followed
by Maxomys, then a sublineage consisting of Niviventer
and Leopoldamys (100% BP; 1.0 PP), and finally, the Rattus
group sensu stricto of Verneau et al. [31], comprising Rattus, Berylmys, Bandicota, Diplothrix, Bunomys and Sundamys.
Almost all dichotomies within Lineage 2 are robustly supported (Figure 1).

Results
Phylogenetics
The final alignments included 1140 sites and 81 taxa for
cyt b, 931 sites and 62 taxa for GHR, 1233 sites and 79 taxa
for IRBP, and 3304 sites for 83 taxa for the concatenated
dataset. The best-fitting substitution models were
TVM+G+I for the GHR and IRBP data sets, and GTR+G+I
for the cyt b and combined data set (Table 1). Analysis of
the combined dataset produced a single ML tree (Figure 1,
lnL = - 50270.78386), the supports obtained for each
node and each gene are presented in the additional files 1
(ML analysis) and 2 (Bayesian analysis). Monophyly of
Murinae is strongly supported but only with inclusion of
the two 'otomyine' taxa (100% BP; 1.0 PP). Ten primary
lineages can be recognized within Murinae, all with strong
nodal support (Figure 1, BP ≥ 97%; PP = 1.0). African
murines are polyphyletic and divided among five lineages. We here describe the different lineages to highlight
the relationships among the African murines.

The third lineage to diverge in the ML tree (Lineage 3,
100% BP; 1.0 PP) is a western Pacific group, divided into
two well-supported sub-lineages: 1) a Philippine group
(Apomys, Archboldomys, Chrotomys, and Rhynchomys: 100%
BP; 1.0 PP); and 2) an Australo-Papuan group (Hydromys,
Conilurus and Pseudomys: 100% BP; 1.0 PP). The relationships within Lineage 3 are mostly well resolved, save for
some uncertainty over the branching order among Apomys, Chrotomys and Rhynchomys.
The fourth lineage consists of the genus Mus (Lineage 4,
100% BP; 1.0 PP), represented by all four subgenera
including the African Nannomys. The relationships among
the four Mus subgenera remain unresolved as the position
of Mus (Nannomys) minutoides and Mus (Coelomys) crociduroides is unstable between ML and BI analyses [see additional files 1 and 2].

The fifth murine lineage is a diverse and robustly supported African assemblage (Lineage 5, 100% BP; 1.0 PP)
that corresponds to the 'Praomys group' of Lecompte et al.
[13]. The monophyly of Lineage 5 is further supported by
a shared insertion of 6 bp (TTGCCT) at position 893 of
the GHR gene alignment. Although the basal nodes
within Lineage 5 are poorly supported, it appears likely
that Mastomys and Myomyscus are both paraphyletic. The
order of branching between sublineages is unresolved and
incongruent between ML and BI analyses [see additional
files 1 and 2]. However, several terminal groups have
strong support: 1) Myomyscus verreauxii + Colomys + Zelotomys (100% BP; 1.0 PP); 2) Mastomys (apart from M. pernanus) (100% BP; 1.0 PP); and 3) Praomys (apart from P.
verschureni) (82% BP; 1.0 PP).
The sixth lineage (Lineage 6, 100% BP; 1.0 PP) consists of
the genus Malacomys, the African swamp rats, here represented by two of the two recognized species.
The seventh murine lineage (Lineage 7, 99% BP; 1.0 PP)
comprises the Eurasian genus Apodemus and the Ryukyu
Island endemic genus Tokudaia.
The eighth lineage (Lineage 8, 97% BP; 1.0 PP) consists of
the Indian genera Cremnomys and Millardia, the latter represented by two species.
The ninth murine lineage (Lineage 9, 100% BP; 1.0 PP)
consists of the African 'otomyines' Parotomys and Otomys.
As noted earlier, Musser and Carleton [8] included these
taxa in a separate subfamily – Otomyinae.
The last murine lineage (Lineage 10, 90% BP; 1.0 PP) is
very diverse and unites a large African assemblage of 'arvicanthines' (sensu Ducroz et al. [12]). Nodal support for
'arvicanthine' monophyly is moderately strong (90% BP;
1.0 PP). Branching order within this group is less well
defined, with numerous distinct lineages apparent. The
Indian bush rat genus Golunda occupies a basal position
with moderate support (81% BP; 0.85 PP). Other nearbasal lineages include Oenomys, Stochomys + Hybomys,
Micaelamys, Grammomys, Aethomys, Dasymys and a well
supported (100% BP; 1.0 PP) sublineage which diversified later, consisting of Arvicanthis, Lemniscomys, Mylomys,
Desmomys, Rhabdomys and Pelomys.
Relationships among the ten lineages are partially
resolved under each of ML and BI but nodal support values are only moderate to strong. The best support is
observed for a diverse Afro-Asian large group comprising
Lineages 4 to 7, which we here call Clade A (93% BP; 1.0
PP). Monophyly of Clade A is further supported by an
insertion of 6 bp (YGGAYG) at position 86 of the GHR
alignment. Within this group, Lineages 6 and 7 are identi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/199

fied as sister lineages but with only moderate support
(77% BP; 0.68 PP); and Lineages 4 and 5 form a second
sister pair, also with only moderate support (77% BP;
0.69 PP). Lineages 8, 9 and 10, also representing a mix of
both African and Asian taxa, are united on the ML tree
with moderate to strong support (87% BP, 1.00 PP) in
what is named Clade B. Lineages 9 and 10 are sister taxa,
with a very strong nodal support (100% BP; 1.0 PP).
Clades A and B are identified as sister lineages on the ML
tree, and build up what we refer to Clade C, albeit with
very low support (51% BP). This clade C includes all the
African murines. A different topology was obtained under
BI [see additional file 2] in which Lineage 3 (Philippine
and Australo-Papuan groups) forms the sister group of
Clade B, once again with low support (0.60 PP). This was
the only discrepancy in branching order among the primary lineages of Murinae observed between the two
methods.
Molecular divergence estimates
Estimated divergence times are indicated on the ML topology in Figure 2. A detailed chronogram is provided in the
additional file 3. The standard deviations of all estimates
fall between 0.5 to 0.7 Million years (My); this error value
is implied in all divergence estimates indicated below.
Divergence time estimations, standard deviations and
credibility intervals calculated by multidivtime for the
main nodes are indicated in the additional file 4, both for
the combined dataset and for each gene separately. There
is good congruence between the various estimations but
with larger standard deviations for the ones based on one
gene than for the values obtained with the combined
dataset.

The earliest cladogenic event (to Lineage 1) is dated to
12.3 Mya. Emergence of the Clade C containing all African
taxa as well as many Eurasian lineages is dated 11.1 Mya.
Cladogenesis of the Afro-Asian Clades A and B is dated to
11 Mya. Divergences between each of Lineages 4 + 5, 6 +
7 and Clade B all fall within the interval 10.1–10.3 Mya.
However, while these lineages originated more or less
simultaneously, their subsequent diversification was
unbalanced and asynchronous. Five of the seven lineages
comprise only one or two genera (Lineages 4, 6, 7, 8 and
9), while the two most diverse and well-sampled lineages,
corresponding to the main part of the African diversity,
radiated somewhat at different times, at about 8.4 Mya
(Lineage 10: 'arvicanthines') and 7.6 Mya (Lineage 5:
'Praomys group'), respectively. As we have a good sampling within these African groups (14 of 18 genera in the
'arvicanthines' and 8 of 9 genera in the Praomys group),
we are confident that our results accurately reflect the
diversification histories of these lineages.

The phylogeny shows strong geographic structure (shown
Figure 2) with most primary lineages restricted to a single
biogeographic area. Notable exceptions are the genus Mus
(Lineage 4), which includes both Eurasian and African
sub-lineages, Lineages 9+10 which are predominantly
African ('otomyines' and 'arvicanthines') but also
includes the Asian genus Golunda, and the African Praomys
group (Lineage 5) which also includes the Arabian species
Myomyscus yemeni.
Three near-basal cladogenic events within Murinae correspond to separations between 'mostly Asian' and 'mostly
African' lineages. The first of these, dated to 10.22 Mya,
separates the Praomys group (Lineage 5) from the predominantly Asian genus Mus. The second, dated to 10.20 Mya,
separates the African 'arvicanthines+otomyines' (Lineages
9+10) from the Asian Millardia/Cremnomys (Lineage 8).
The third one, dated to 10.16 Mya, separates Malacomys
from Apodemus/Tokudaia.
Within Lineage 10, there is a younger separation, dated to
around 8.4 Mya, between the African 'arvicanthines' and
Golunda, a genus currently found only in Asia. Within
Mus, divergence of the African subgenus Nannomys from
various Eurasian subgenera is dated to 6.6 Mya.

Discussion
Phylogenetic relationships of African Murinae and a new
suprageneric taxonomy
Many of our ten primary lineages of Murinae were also
identified by other scholars in previous molecular phylogenetic studies of Murinae [13,14,16,23,24,32]. However,
our enlarged taxon sampling has improved the support
for some relationships, which were tentatively identified
in previous studies and also identified new primary lineages and associations. Based on these robust results and
on the geographical structure of the phylogeny, we propose to formalize a tribal level of classification within
Murinae (see Table 2), for convenient use above the informal rank of division employed by Musser and Carleton
[8].

Tribe Phloemyini (Lineage 1): A basal division within
Murinae between certain Philippine 'Old Endemics' and
all other murines was first suggested by Watts and Baverstock [10] based on microcomplement fixation of albumin, and strongly supported since then by numerous
nuclear and/or mitochondrial gene phylogenies
([6,7,14,16,24], this study). Broader membership of this
group includes two other endemic Philippine murine genera, Carpomys and Crateromys [14]. All members of this
group are morphologically specialised in different ways
but they do share at least one clearly derived dental trait –
an unusually complex anteroconid morphology on the
first lower molar [33]. The name Phloeomyinae Alston,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/199

1876 (used at tribal level by Tullberg [34]) is available for
this lineage. Musser and Carleton [8] recognised the same
group as their Phloeomys division. We propose the tribe
Phloeomyini Alston, 1876 new rank, for a clade containing the extant genera: Batomys, Carpomys, Crateromys and
Phloeomys.
Tribe Rattini (Lineage 2): Our Lineage 2 corresponds in
part to the 'South-East Asian clade' of Watts and Baverstock [10], the 'Rattus group sensu lato' of Verneau et al.
[31] and the 'Rattus group' of Steppan et al. [24]. Jansa et
al. [14] also recovered an equivalent lineage that includes
various Philippines murines including Crunomys and
members of the 'New Endemic' assemblage of Musser and
Heaney [33]. Where our findings differ from most previous phylogenies is in the identification of the Eurasian
harvest mouse, Micromys minutus, as the probable sister
lineage to the 'Rattus group sensu lato'. Previous results for
Micromys either identified it as a basal lineage within
Murinae [10,17,35], or hinted at a possible relationship
with Apodemus, Mus, Rattus or Tokudaia [6,12,36-38]. Our
conclusion that Micromys is linked to 'Rattus group sensu
lato' is also supported by the multilocus studies of
Michaux et al. [32] and Rowe et al. [16]. Musser and Carleton [8] partitioned members of our Lineage 2 among
five divisions (Table 2: Crunomys, Dacnomys, Maxomys,
Micromys and Rattus divisions). Their Micromys division
included five other Asian genera of arboreal murines (Chiropodomys, Haeromys, Hapalomys, Vandeleuria and Vernaya). Watts and Baverstock [10] identified a possible link
between Vandeleuria and Micromys within Murinae, based
on microcomplement fixation of albumin. However,
Rowe et al.'s [16] recent multilocus molecular phylogeny
of Murinae shows Chiropodomys as a sister lineage to our
lineage 3, while Vandeleuria is a primary lineage within
our clade A. Rowe et al. [16] also provide strong molecular
evidence for the inclusion of genera Melasmothrix, Chiromyscus, and Paruromys into the clade that we here recognize as lineage 2. The only family level name that is based
on a member of this group is Rattidae Burnett, 1830. This
name is here applied for Lineage 2 at tribal level, as Rattini
Burnett, 1830 new rank. Pending their inclusion in future
molecular studies, we recommend that Haeromys, Hapalomys and Vernaya be treated as Murinae incertae sedis.
Tribe Hydromyini (Lineage 3): Our Lineage 3 corresponds
to the 'Australasian group' identified by Steppan et al.
[24]. Jansa et al. [14] recovered a clade that includes the
Philippine members of this group but their study did not
include any Australo-Papuan murines. Ford [15], using a
combination of mitochondrial and nuclear intron
sequences, demonstrated the close affinity of all Australian murine genera (Rattus excluded) but did not include
any Philippine taxon in his study. Watts and Baverstock
[10] included the majority of Australian and New Guin-

ean murine genera in their microcomplement fixation
study of albumin but they had poor coverage of Philippine murines. They failed to recover a single lineage that
includes all Australo-Papuan murines. Studies of sperm
ultrastructure also point to monophyly of the majority of
Australo-Papuan murines, albeit with some notable
exceptions [39,40]. Rowe et al. [16] included a wide array
of Australo-Papuan and Philippine murines in their multilocus analysis, including representatives of the four
suprageneric taxa recognised in previous studies of these
regional faunas (i.e. uromyines, conilurines, hydromyines
and anisomyines). Their results further confirm monophyly of the clade that we here define as tribe Hydromyini, and their study identifies Chiropodomys as the sister
taxon of Hydromyini. Numerous family level names have
been applied to members of our Lineage 3 (e.g. Hydromyina Gray, 1825; Coniluridae Dahl, 1897; Rhynchomyinae Thomas, 1897; Anisomyes Ellerman, 1941;
Pseudomyinae Simpson, 1961; Uromyini Lee, Baverstock,
and Watts, 1981). We recommend use of the name
Hydromyina Gray, 1825 for this group, applied at tribal
level as Hydromyini. Our application of this name is more
inclusive than any prior usage, e.g. [39,41-44], and as
group membership demonstrably includes each of Conilurus, Pseudomys, Uromys, Anisomys and Rhynchomys ([24],
this study), all of the other family level names based on
Australasian murines either are objective synonyms of
tribe Hydromyini or else are applicable only below this
rank. We further recommend, pending further studies,
that a suite of poorly studied Papuan genera be treated as
incertae sedis within Murinae (Table 2). Use of one tribal
name – Hydromyini – for this expended Australo-Papuan
and Philippine murine radiation serves to draw attention
to the phylogenetic connection between these geographically isolated assemblages. Musser and Carleton [8]
divided members of our tribe Hydromyini among seven
divisions (Table 2: Chrotomys, Hydromys, Pogonomys, Pseudomys, Uromys, Xeromys and Lorentzimys divisions).
Our Clade C contains a highly heterogeneous and geographically disparate assemblage, including all the African
murines. Although this lineage has a poor basal support,
a comparable assemblage was recently recovered with
strength by Rowe et al[16], whose study clearly indicates
that Vandeleuria also belongs to that clade. Within this
group, we identify a total of seven primary lineages (Lineages 4–10), each well supported and geographically unified; and we note that the same seven lineages were
recovered by Rowe et al. [16]. Our division of Clade C into
two major sections [Clades A (Lineages 4–7) and B (Lineages 8–10)] is also supported by the results of previous
multi-gene analyses [16,24], and by the presence of diagnostic indel events in the GHR alignment for several
nodes (basal for Clade A; basal for Lineage 5), and we are
confident as to the essential correctness of the topology.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/199

In terms of taxonomy, we might assign all members of
Clade C to a single tribe, for which the earliest available
name would be Murina Illiger, 1811. However, we prefer
a more expansive tribal classification that recognises the
huge taxic and ecomorphological diversity contained
within Clade C. Accordingly, we propose to represent a
total of seven tribes for each of Lineages 4–10. The result
is an overall tribal classification of Murinae that is concordant in large measure with geographic partitioning and
also has strong morphological expression.
Tribe Murini (Lineage 4): Our suggestion that the genus
Mus be separated at tribal level is consistent with the previous lack of agreement over the sister taxon of this biomedically important genus [6,18,19,24,25]. As indicated
above, the name Murina Illiger, 1811 is available and
appropriate, adapted as tribe Murini (first used at this
rank by Winge [42]). The position of African subgenus
Nannomys within Mus is variously proposed to be polytomous with the other three subgenera of Mus [19,45], basal
within Mus ([20], this study), or as sister to the subgenus
Mus [21]. However, a recent phylogenomic analysis gives
compelling evidence that subgenus Nannomys is the second lineage to diverge within Mus, after subgenus Coelomys [46]. Musser and Carleton [8] recognised a Mus
division and included Muriculus as a second genus. This
rare African monotypic genus, endemic to Ethiopia, has
not been available for molecular study. Osgood [47]
noticed morphological links to Mus and to Zelotomys, a
taxon here included within Lineage 5. Pending its inclusion in future molecular studies, we recommend that
Muriculus be treated as Murinae incertae sedis.
Tribe Praomyini (Lineage 5): Our results agree with those
of Steppan et al. [24] and Rowe et al. [16] on the identification of a diverse but almost exclusively African lineage
as the sister lineage to Mus. Monophyly of this group (our
Lineage 5) has strong nodal support and is further supported by a shared insertion in the GHR gene alignment.
Lineage 5 corresponds to the 'Praomys group' of Lecompte
et al. [13,25,48]. We propose the new name Praomyini
tribe nov. for this well-supported monophyletic assemblage, with Praomys Thomas, 1915 as type genus on
account of its familiarity. Our results and those of previous studies [13,25,48], confirm inclusion within the Praomyini of Colomys, Heimyscus, Hylomyscus, Mastomys,
Myomyscus, Praomys, Stenocephalemys, and Zelotomys. The
genus Nilopegamys, previously considered as a subgenus of
Colomys, is here regarded as a member of tribe Praomyini
on morphological criteria [13]. Musser and Carleton [8]
placed the members of our Praomyini in two divisions,
the Stenocephalemys and Colomys divisions, based upon
morphological and previous molecular datasets. Our
results suggest a different arrangement of taxa within this
group, with Myomyscus verrauxii, the type species of this

Page 10 of 21
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:199

problematic genus, grouping with Colomys and Zelotomys
rather than with Stenocephalemys as suggested by Musser
and Carleton [8]. Our expanded molecular dataset supports previous suggestions by Lecompte et al. [13,25,48],
that each of Myomyscus and Mastomys are paraphyletic
within the Praomyini. As in previous molecular and morphological analyses [13], the genus Praomys appears to be
monophyletic with inclusion of P. verschureni and P. daltoni, although support is still quite low. Our enlarged
dataset also resolves some relationships within the Praomyini, especially at the base of the clade, where resolution
was poor in previous analyses [13]. The first lineage to
diverge appears to be the clade Heimyscus-Hylomyscus-Mastomys pernanus, followed by the cluster Myomyscus verreauxii, Zelotomys and Colomys. The remaining members of
this group (Praomys, all savanah-dwelling Mastomys except
M. pernanus, Stenocephalemys, Myomyscus brockmani and M.
yemeni) form a poorly supported cluster. However, within
this cluster, one well supported sister-group relationship
links the East African species Myomyscus brockmani and the
Arabian species Myomyscus yemeni. Analysis of a larger
suite of genes is necessary to clarify relationships within
this interesting assemblage of African murines.
Tribe Malacomyini (Lineage 6): Malacomys has long been
regarded as an isolated and enigmatic genus, whether
assessed on dental morphology ([9]: 106) or on chromosomes [49]. Its isolated position is confirmed by our
results and other molecular multilocus analyses [16,32].
The taxon Malacomyini tribe nov. is based on type genus
Malacomys Milne-Edwards, 1877.
Tribe Apodemini (Lineage 7): Apodemus is among the
most thoroughly studied of all murine genera, both from
a molecular perspective, e.g. [17,38,50], and based upon
the rich fossil record of western Eurasia, e.g. [51,52]. A
close relationship between Apodemus and Tokudaia was
suggested on dental morphology, e.g. [9], but molecular
supporting data were only recently obtained [16,17,38].
Our analysis confirms a sister relation between Apodemus
and Tokudaia but also highlight the considerable antiquity
of their generic divergence. The taxon Apodemini tribe
nov. is based on type genus Apodemus Kaup, 1829.
Our analysis identifies Malacomys as a possible sister lineage to Apodemus + Tokudaia. Although nodal support is
rather poor (77% BP; 0.69 PP) on our tree, we note that a
comparable grouping of these lineages was observed in
various other multi-locus analyses [13,16,32]. An exception is the multi-gene topology of Steppan et al. [24] in
which Malacomys occupies a more basal position within a
group corresponding to our Clade A. Musser and Carleton
[8] recognised separate Apodemus and Malacomys divisions
and we follow their lead in treating each of Lineages 6 and
7 as separate murine tribes. Moreover, since no included

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/199

genus has previously formed the basis of a family level
name, we propose two new names at tribal rank for these
lineages. Although both lineages have limited generic
diversity, we note that the genus Apodemus, despite being
morphologically conservative, contains far greater molecular diversity than many other murine genera. Musser and
Carleton [8] included the recently extinct genus Rhagamys
from Corsica and Sardinia in the Apodemus division, based
on paleontological interpretations of its dental morphology, e.g. [52], and we follow this lead.
All remaining murines examined in this study fall into our
Clade B. Key members of this group are the Indian Millardia + Cremnomys and the African 'arvicanthines' and 'otomyines'. Phyletic association of Otomys + Parotomys with
the 'arvicanthines' is robustly supported by numerous
other molecular analyses and must now be considered as
proven [6,11,12,14,16,24]. Association of Millardia +
Cremnomys with this group is a more controversial finding, although we note a comparable topology in the DNA/
DNA hybridization results of Chevret [23] and partial
support from several recent molecular analysis [16,32].
Ducroz et al. ([12]: p 200) found no evidence from analyses of mitochondrial DNA of close relationship between
Millardia and African arvicanthines, while Watts and
Baverstock ([10]: p111) concluded from their albumin
immunology that "Millardia appears to be a monogeneric
lineage arising early in the history of the murines". Rowe
et al. [16] identified conflict among the three genes available for the position of Millardia. Our analysis differs
mainly in the inclusion of two Millardia species and a representative of the genus Cremnomys and this wider taxon
sampling may account for the improved support for the
sister group relationship of this lineage with the 'arvicanthines' and 'otomyines'. However, conflict with previous
analysis highlights the need for further testing of this relationship using sequences from other slowly evolving
nuclear genes.
Consistent with our treatment of Clade A, we propose to
recognize three separate tribes within Clade B, an arrangement that in our view best reflects the taxic and morphological diversity, and the geographic partitioning of this
assemblage.
Tribe Millardini (Lineage 8): We propose to recognize as
tribe the predominantly Indian genera Millardia and
Cremnomys. Musser and Carleton [8] distinguished this
lineage as their Millardia division. We propose Millardini
tribe nov., with type genus Millardia Thomas, 1911 and
referred genus Cremnomys.
Tribe Otomyini (Lineage 9): Traditional recognition of a
subfamily Otomyinae for the African genera Otomys and
Parotomys reflects the extreme specialization of the cheek-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:199

teeth of these taxa, especially among members of the
genus Otomys. Despite compelling molecular [6,11,12],
and paleontological [53-55] evidence that otomyines not
only belong within Murinae but are specifically associated
with arvicanthines ([14,16,24], this study), the notion of
taxonomic isolation maintains an inertia that is difficult
to break, e.g. Musser and Carleton [8]. Like some previous
authors [55,56], we advocate recognition of this lineage at
tribal level, as Otomyini Thomas, 1896 with type genus
Otomys Cuvier, 1824.
Tribe Arvicanthini (Lineage 10): Ducroz et al. [12] proposed a tribe Arvicanthini but failed to explicitly designate
a type genus. As indicated by Musser and Carleton [8],
their name is a nomen nudum and nomenclaturally unavailable. We here formalise the Arvicanthini tribe nov.
with type genus Arvicanthis Lesson, 1842. The tribe corresponds in large part to Misonne [9] 's 'Arvicanthis division'
but with notable additions (Oenomys, [11,12,24], this
study) and exceptions (Bandicota and Nesokia, both close
relatives of Rattus, [32,57], this study). The arvicanthine
affinity of the Indian genus Golunda was promoted on
dental criteria by each of Misonne [9] and Musser [58],
and was weakly supported by the 12S and 16S mitochondrial gene phylogenies of Ducroz et al. [12] and by the
IRBP and cytochrome b phylogeny of Michaux et al. [32].
Our results confirm this association, with moderately
strong nodal support, and provide, for the first time, a
basal position for Golunda within the tribe. Based on earlier molecular work and our expanded taxon sampling,
confirmed members of the tribe Arvicanthini are
Aethomys, Arvicanthis, Dasymys, Desmomys, Golunda, Grammomys, Hybomys, Lemniscomys, Micaelamys, Mylomys, Oenomys, Pelomys, Rhabdomys, Stochomys, Thallomys and
Thamnomys ([12,16,24,32], this study). Our tribe Arvicanthini thus includes genera of the Aethomys, Arvicanthis,
Dasymys, Golunda, Hybomys and Oenomys divisions of
Musser and Carleton [8] (see Table 2). Our phylogeny for
Arvicanthini is the first one based on nuclear genes and it
also features enlarged taxon sampling. We confirm earlier
mtDNA evidence [12] of a clade containing Arvicanthis,
Desmomys, Lemniscomys, Mylomys, Pelomys, and Rhabdomys,
and for sister-group relationships between Mylomys and
Pelomys, and between Desmomys and Rhabdomys. Our
results depart from previous interpretations in the wellsupported grouping of Arvicanthis and Lemniscomys as sister taxa (Lemniscomys occupied a basal position within the
clade in previous analyses [12]). The inclusion of previously unsampled taxa in our phylogeny also produced
new insights into Arvicanthini phylogeny, most notably
the basal position of Golunda, followed by the divergence
of Oenomys then by the highly supported clade containing
Stochomys and Hybomys. The basal position of Oenomys
among the arvicanthini was also proposed in a recent
molecular study [16] despite sparse sampling within the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/199

tribe. The other associations identified here are not supported by previous analyses and they require further testing with sequences from other slowly evolving nuclear
genes.
Some genera, not yet available for molecular phylogenetic
studies, can be associated with the Arvicanthini on morphological criteria. For example, the rare African genus
Dephomys shares dental and cranial morphometric traits
with Hybomys [9,59], and was included in the Hybomys
division by Musser and Carleton [8]. Similarly, the monotypic genus Lamottemys, described after the work of Misonne, is thought be closely related to Oenomys [60,61],
and was included in the Oenomys division by Musser and
Carleton [8]. Malpaisomys, an extinct genus from the
Canary Islands, was also included in the Oenomys division
by Musser and Carleton [8], based on morphological
studies by Lopez-Martinez et al. [62] and their own assessment. These authors also suggest that Canariomys, the
other murine endemic from the Canary Island, might be a
member of this divison but that morphological reexamination of the specimens is needed. Finally, the Manipur
bush rat, genus Hadromys, was included within the Arvicanthis division by Misonne [9] but regarded as potentially distinct from this lineage by Musser [58]. Musser
and Carleton [8] placed this Indian genus in its own
monotypic division and we follow suite by listing it as
incertae sedis within Murinae (Table 2).
Timing of cladogenesis among African lineages
Several authors have estimated divergence times among
muroids from molecular data [7,11,12,14,16-18,38,63].
These studies have involved different gene and taxon sampling, and used a variety of different methods and means
of calibration. Not surprisingly, the results are quite variable. Our estimates for the timing of key cladogenic events
for the African murine diversity, based on a relaxed molecular clock, are: 10.2 Mya (± 0.6) for origin of Arvicanthini+Otomyini; 10.2 Mya (± 0.6) for origin of
Praomyini; 10.2 (± 0.5) for the origin of Malacomys; 8.4
My (± 0.6) for the origin of extant arvicanthine lineages;
7.6 My (± 0.6) for the origin of extant Praomyini; and 6.6
Mya (± 0.7) for the origin of extant subgenera within Mus
including the African subgenus Nannomys (Figure 2). Our
estimates for the timing of other cladogenic events are presented in additional file 3 and 4.

Our divergence time estimates are consistently older than
those calculated by Chevret et al. [11,63], based on a DNA
hybridization dataset. The differences reflect their use of a
different calibration (10 My for Mus/Rattus divergence)
combined with a fixed-rate molecular clock. Our estimates for origin of extant arvicanthine and praomyine lineages are consistent with the 8 My estimate obtained by
Ducroz et al [12] for arvicanthines but younger than the

Page 12 of 21
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:199

8.5 Mya estimate for Praomyini obtained by Lecompte et
al. [25]. Both studies used mitochondrial DNA sequences,
the same calibration points (Mus/Rattus divergence at 12
Mya and/or Murinae/Gerbillinae divergence at 16 Mya),
and a fixed-rate molecular clock. In a more recent paper
using a combined cyt b and IRBP dataset and a Mus/Rattus
divergence time set to 12 Mya, Lecompte et al. [13]
derived estimates of 7.4–9.3 Mya for the origin of extant
lineages with Arvicanthini and 6.7–8.4 Mya for lineages
within Praomyini, results that are congruent with those
reported here.
Steppan et al. [7] derived divergence estimates from a four
nuclear gene concatenation, using a variety of different
estimation methods and a 12 My fossil calibration point
for the basal radiation of all extant Murinae. Since their
study included Batomys, a member of our Phloeomyini,
this represents a deeper divergence than the usual Mus/
Rattus split assigned to 12 Mya. Their divergence estimates
(8.8–10.3 Mya for Mus/Rattus, 7.9–9.7 Mya for Mus/Arvicanthis and 6.9–8.8 My for Mus/Mastomys) are consistently
younger by 1–2 Mya than those obtained here. A similar
difference in estimates of divergence times is observed
between the multilocus study of Rowe et al. [16] and our
results (for example, Mus/Rattus at 9.7 ± 0.5 versus 11.3 ±
0.5 Mya). As rightly pointed by Steppan et al. [7] and
Rowe et al. [16], these differences most obviously reflect
the nodal assignment on the topology of the crucial transition from fossil Antemus to fossil Progonomys at 12.1
Mya. In addition, the differences may also reflect selection
of other calibration points, and the differences in taxon
sampling.
Several molecular studies on Apodemus suggest an early
divergence between Tokudaia and Apodemus as well as
between the main lineages within Apodemus
[17,37,38,50]. We derived estimates of 10.2 Mya (± 0.5)
for the separation of Apodemus and Malacomys, 9.6 (± 0.5)
for Apodemus/Tokudaia and 8.6 (± 0.5) for the earliest
divergence within Apodemus. Similar estimates were found
by Michaux et al. [17] but Sato and Suzuki [38] obtained
highly variable times for the Apodemus/Tokudaia divergence with each of their five data sets, ranging from
6.5–7.6 My for IRBP to 11.3–13.2 Mya for mitochondrial
cyt b.
The genus Mus has been subjected to extensive phylogenetic study, e.g. [18,20,45], though in most studies the
African Nannomys was underrepresented. We estimated
the initial divergence of extant Mus [including Nannomys]
lineages to 6.6 Mya (± 0.7), with Nannomys as the earliest
offshoot. Catzeflis and Denys [19] dated the divergence
between Nannomys and other Mus subgenera to between
5.7 and 4.7 Mya, based on the DNA hybridization method
and a 10 Mya calibration point for the Mus/Rattus diver-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/199

gence. Subsequently, Chevret et al. [64] used a 12 Mya calibration point for the Mus/Rattus divergence and revised
the Nannomys divergence to 5.7 Mya and that of Coelomys
to 6.5 Mya. By also using a calibration point set at 12 My
for the Mus/Rattus split, other studies suggested younger
(5.1 to 5.2 Mya: Suzuki et al. [18]) or similar (6.8 to 7.8
Mya: Chevret et al. [20]; 7.6 ± 1.1 Mya: Veyrunes et al.
[21]) timing for the initial divergence of subgenera within
the genus Mus (inclusive of Nannomys).
Jansa et al. [14] presented divergence time estimates for
murines that are considerably older than our own. For
example, based on IRBP sequences they estimated the
divergence date between our Hydromyini and our
Murini+Praomyini+Arvicanthini at 15.8–20.5 Mya,
depending on calculation method used. These values are
much older than our estimate of 11.1 ± 0.5 Mya for this
divergence. We suspect that Jansa et al. [14] systematically
overestimated divergence times within Murinae through
their use of fossil calibration points placed on more basal
nodes in the Rodentia as well as in the general mammalian tree, leading to an increased likelihood of partial saturation at mutational hotspots. Jansa et al. [14] defended
their divergence estimates by referring to the incompleteness of the fossil record, especially the fact that large parts
of the Old World have almost no relevant small mammal
fossil record.
To further explore this conflict in interpretation, we tested
our molecular divergence framework within the Murinae
against the relatively good fossil record of this group in
Europe, Africa, and South Asia. As shown on Figure 2, the
earliest first fossil occurrences of various lineages all fall
within the time ranges suggested by our divergence date
estimates. Moreover, we note that the oldest fossil Murinae from South Asia and Africa, estimated to be about
12–14 Mya and 10–11 Mya, respectively (Asia: [65,66];
Africa: [67-71]) are not attributable to extant genera (e.g.
Progonomys: [72]; Karnimata: [70,73]); or only tentatively
so (c.f. Stenocephalemys, c.f. Parapelomys: [71]; c.f. Lemniscomys: [74,73]). Conversely, representatives of modern genera are not definitely recorded prior to 5–7 Mya [73,7577] which is consistent with our dating of murine evolution but difficult to reconcile with a much longer evolutionary time frame. Even more convincingly, our
divergence estimates are consistent with first appearance
of murines in the fossil records of Africa around 12 Mya
[30,71,72] and in Europe around 11 Mya [78,79].
Biogeographic implications for African murines
Our molecular phylogeny contributes in several ways to
an improved understanding of the pattern and timing of
initial murine colonization of Africa. The earliest, generally accepted murine fossils occur in the sedimentary
record of the Siwalik Hills of Pakistan, and date to around

14 Mya [65,66,80,81]. In contrast, the earliest murine fossils from anywhere in Africa date to less than 12 Mya [68],
despite the fact that other groups of muroid rodents
(including the genus Potwarmus, a taxon of uncertain subfamilial affinity) are represented in older fossil deposits,
e.g. [69,71,82]. Similarly, the abundant fossil record of
Europe contains no evidence of murines prior to 11 Mya,
at which time they appear fully differentiated and
undergo rapid diversification [78,79]. This disparity
between the various regional fossil records suggests that
Murinae originated in Asia and colonized both Africa and
Europe during a common period of dispersal [30,72]. Our
molecular phylogeny of Murinae is consistent with this
scenario to the extent that each of the three basal branches
on our phylogeny (Phloeomyini, Rattini and Hydromyini) is almost entirely restricted to Asia and/or the
major islands of the western Pacific (i.e. Philippines and
Australasia). The major exceptions are Micromys, an extant
genus with a wide Palearctic distribution [8] but with no
known African fossil record [83], and the fossil genus
Karnimata, which is best known from the Siwalik
sequence but is also reported from late Miocene localities
in southern and eastern Africa [77]. Karnimata is a possible stem genus for our Rattini [65,72], and its presence in
Africa, if confirmed by further study of the fossils, would
imply that some early immigrant lineages died out without leaving modern descendants.
Jacobs et al. [80] postulated that dispersal of murines
from Asia to Africa started around 11.8 Mya, following
establishment of a vegetation corridor between Africa and
Asia across the recently established Arabian peninsula
[30,76,84-87]. The best evidence of intercontinental dispersal by mammals during this period is the sudden
appearance of equids ('Hipparion') in the African fossil
record [86,88,89]. Significantly, the earliest African hipparionines and murines occur together in sites dated to
around 11 Mya in Algeria [68] and 10 Mya in Ethiopia
[86,90]. Just how many murine lineages crossed from Eurasia into Africa during this early period of dispersal is less
certain, with somewhat contradictory indications coming
from each of the fossil record and the molecular phylogeny.
The earliest fossil murines from African localities are
referred to the genus Progonomys [68,86,90,91]. Slightly
younger localities in Namibia and East-Africa, dated to
around 9–10 Mya contain more diverse murine faunas
with Karnimata sp., Aethomys, c.f. Parapelomys sp. and c.f.
Stenocephalemys sp. [69-71,92]. As noted above, Karnimata
is a typical Asian Miocene genus but the other taxa suggest
an early period of in situ diversification leading to each of
the endemic African praomyine and arvicanthine lineages. In apparent contradiction to this scenario, our
molecular phylogeny suggests that each of three early

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/199

branches of the African murine radiation (Praomyini,
Arvicanthini+Otomyini and Malacomyini) has a sister lineage among Eurasian Murinae (Murini, Millardini and
Apodemini, respectively). The obvious interpretation is
that each of these lineages was differentiated prior to their
dispersal into Africa, and arrived around the same time as
part of a broader episode of faunal interchange. Our divergence time estimates would place this period of faunal
interchange followed by regional differentiation in the
interval 11–10 Mya – a very good fit with the fossil record
of Africa and Asia. However, an alternative scenario, only
marginally more complex, could posit an early dispersal
to Africa, followed by differentiation and back dispersal of
three lineages from Africa to Eurasia (ancestral Murini,
Apodemini and Millardini). A detailed reassessment of
the earliest African murine fossils, looking for evidence of
phyletic continuity versus disjunction, might resolve this
issue. Until this is done, we must be content with the
notion of a shared biogeographic province spanning the
'Arabic Corridor' across which various early murines referrable to Progonomys, Karnimata and possibly other genera
made their way between southwest Asia and northern
Africa, starting around 11 Mya. These populations presumably included basal members of the Apodemini +
Malacomyini, the Murini + Praomyini, and our Clade B
(stem group of Millardini + Otomyini + Arvicanthini).
The earliest African fossil faunas of fully modern aspect
(i.e. with species confidently assigned to extant genera)
date to the interval 7–5 Mya [73,75-77,92-95]. However,
due to sizable gaps in the African fossil record, it is currently unclear whether these later murines were derived
from the earliest colonists or from a later wave of colonization from Asia, or perhaps from a combination of both.
Certainly, the appearance around 7–9 Mya in the African
record of distinctively Asian lineages of Bovidae [96],
Elephantoidea [97] and non-murine rodents [30,76,98] is
strong evidence for habitat continuity and dispersal
between Asia and Africa during the terminal Miocene.
However, the rise to dominance of the Gerbillinae in the
fossil record of the Middle East during the interval 7–8
Mya also suggests increasingly arid conditions on the Arabian Peninsula [84,99]. This may have presented a barrier
to dispersal by murine rodents, and and hence, caused the
onset of independent diversification of the African and
Asian murine faunas. Direct evidence for murine dispersal
into Africa during this period is limited by the paucity of
the fossil record.
We estimate the timing of diversification of modern Arvicanthini + Otomyini at 8.6 ± 0.6 Mya, and of modern
Praomyini at 7.6 ± 0.6 Mya. Diversification of the modern
African murine genera thus seems to narrowly postdate
the disruption of the Arabic Corridor.

After 6 Mya, there is renewed evidence of faunal interchange between Africa and each of Southwest Asia and
Western Europe [28,76,91,100-105]. This coincides with
a period of global sea level depression [106], and with the
combination of eustatic and tectonic events in the Mediterranean region that precipitated Messinian salinity crisis
[84,107]. Fossil evidence from the circum-Mediterranean
region through this period documents significant dispersal
and
associated
mammalian
turnover
[28,84,100,102,108,109]. Among murine rodents, a species of Mus probably entered Africa from Asia around this
time, somewhere between 6.6 ± 0.7 Mya (the divergence
estimate for the subgenus Nannomys within Mus) and 4.0
± 0.8 Mya (the earliest cladogenic event within subgenus
Nannomys [20,21]). The earliest fossil occurrence of Mus
in Africa comes from Kenya, dated to 4.5 Mya [76].
Around the same time, a species of Myomyscus (Praomyini) evidently spread to the Arabic region, giving rise to
the modern species M. yemeni. We estimate the time of
divergence of this species from its East African sister species (M. brockmani) at 5.1 ± 0.6 Mya, which also coincides
locally with the opening of the Red Sea. In North Africa,
the western European fossil genus Occitanomys is recorded
for the first time in a section younger than 5.32 Mya [91].
Finally, the fossil record also provides some examples of
late Tertiary murine dispersal between Asia and Africa.
Most notably, African sites of latest Miocene-Pliocene age
reportedly contain several 'Indian' genera (Millardia and
Golunda) [91,98,110], while Asian localities of latest
Miocene and early Pliocene age have produced several
genera of possible arvicanthines. One such lineage is the
extinct arvicanthine genus Saidomys, with a stratigraphic
range that extends back to the late Miocene in Africa
[76,104], to the early Pliocene in Pakistan and Afghanistan [28,100], and to the latest Pliocene in Thailand
[111]. The extinct genus Parapelomys, known from several
South Asian localities of latest Miocene and early Pliocene
age, is also touted as possible arvicanthine [28,112].
Environmental changes after 3 Myr probably caused the
regional extinction of some lineages and generally shaped
the modern continental faunas [113-115]. The genera Millardia and Golunda may have disappeared from Africa,
while Saidomys and Occitanomys went to global extinction.
Over the same period, numerous groups of African
murines radiated to fill newly emerging habitats. However, few were quite so successful as the African pigmy
mice (18 living species are recognized for the subgenus
Nannomys [8]), which appear to have found a largely
underexploited set of niches below the body size range of
other African murines.

Conclusion
Our molecular dataset for Murinae, which includes the
most complete sampling so far of the African murines,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/199

gives compelling evidence for five phyletically separate
radiations within the African region, as well as several
phases of dispersal between Asia and Africa during the late
Miocene to early Pliocene. Through our expanded taxon
sampling, which also includes a good coverage of Eurasian taxa we also reveal many new details concerning the
overall phylogenetic structure of the Murinae, and this
forms a basis for rational classification at tribal level of
this traditionally problematic group. Further studies of
Murinae should target the few remaining African genera
that were not available in our dataset (including Thallomys, Lamottemys and Muriculus), as well as various unsampled Asian taxa (e.g. Hapalomys, Lenothrix) including those
that have been associated with the African Arvicanthini on
morphological grounds (e.g. Hadromys). Dense taxon
sampling of the Australo-Papuan Hydromyini was
recently provided by Rowe et al. [16], although a few
important gaps remain for this region. On a broader level,
a comparison of the phylogenetic structure of Murinae
with that of other co-distributed groups of small mammals, such as Gerbillinae and Soricidae, might shed even
greater light on the history of the faunal interchange and
extinction across Africa and Asia during the last 15 My.

Methods
Taxon and gene sampling
We obtained sequences from 83 species including representatives of 49 murine genera from most previously
identified major murine lineages, as well as eight genera
of Deomyinae and Gerbillinae (Table 3) for use as outgroups [5-7]. Our sampling for African Murinae and otomyines covers 25 out of 32 living African genera and
includes representatives of all the four previously identified lineages. Most genera are represented by a single species but multiple representatives are included for highly
diversified or potentially paraphyletic genera.

Sequences were obtained for two single-copy nuclear
genes (growth hormone receptor exon 10: GHR; and
interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein exon 1:
IRBP) and one mitochondrial-coding gene (cytochrome b
apoenzyme: cyt b). Specimen identification and sequence
data are listed in Table 3.
The nuclear genes were chosen because of their proven
utility for understanding muroid relationships and the
presence of an existing sequence dataset for this group
[6,7,14,24,116,117]. The GHR and IRBP genes are not
genetically linked and their location is variable, on chromosomes 15 and 14 in Mus, and chromosomes 2 and 16
in Rattus [118]. The mitochondrial cytochrome b gene was
chosen because it provides a third independent marker
that evolves at a faster rate than either of the two nuclear
genes, and also is well represented in previous datasets.

*: newly acquired sequences. NA: sequence not available.

Most taxa are represented by sequences from two or three
genes, the one exception being Parotomys for which we
have only GHR sequence (Table 3). All ingroup genera are
represented by sequences from the same species and
where possible, by sequences from the same DNA sample.
Chimeric data (i.e. different sequences deriving from
more than one species of a genus) were used only for two
outgroup taxa: Acomys (A. cahirinus and A. ignitus) and
Meriones (M. unguiculatus and M. shawi).
DNA extraction and sequencing
Total genomic DNA was extracted from tissues preserved
in ethanol using a CTAB protocol [119] or a QiaAmp
extraction kit (Qiagen). The cytochrome b (1140 bp) gene
was amplified as described in Lecompte et al. [25] or
Montgelard et al. [120]. PCRs used the following thermal
cycling parameters: one step at 94°C for 4 min, followed
by 35 cycles (40 s at 94°C, 45 s at 50°C, 1 min at 72°C).
The final extension at the end of the profile was at 72°C
for 10 min.

Part of exon 1 of IRBP (ca 1270 bp) was sequenced, using
the methods of Poux and Douzery [121]. Amplification of
the IRBP gene was performed under the same conditions:
one cycle of 94°C denaturation (5 min), 50°C annealing
(45 s), 72°C extension (1 min); 34 cycles of 94°C denaturation (45 s), 50°C (or 60°C) annealing (45 s), 72°C
extension (1 min); and a final extension of 72°C (10
min).
Exon 10 of the GHR gene was amplified using the following parameters: 95°C (5 min); 5 cycles of 95°C (30 s),
61°C (30 s), 72°C (1 min); 5 cycles of 95°C (30 s), 59°C
(30 s), 72°C (1 min); 5 cycles of 95°C (30 s), 57°C (30
s), 72°C (1 min), 5 cycles of 95°C (30 s), 55°C (30 s),
72°C (1 min); 20 cycles of 95°C (30 s), 53°C (30 s),
72°C (1 min); and a final extension of 72°C (10 min).
The primers used were GHR 1 (= GHREXON10, [122])

and GHR2 (GATTTTGTTCAGTTGGTCTGTGCTCAC) and
two internal primers GHR7 (AAGCTGATCTCTTGTGCCTTGACCAGAA) and GHR8 (TTGGCATCTGACTCACAGAAGTAGG).
Double-stranded PCR products were purified directly
from the PCR product or from agarose gel using the MinElute purification kit (Qiagen) or Amicon Ultrafree-DNA
columns (Millipore) and sequenced directly on both
strands using an automatic sequencer CEQ2000 (Beckman) or an ABI 310 (PE Applied Biosystems).
The new sequences were deposited in the EMBL data
bank. Accession numbers for all sequences used in this
analysis are listed in Table 3.
Analyses
Phylogenetic reconstruction
Sequences were manually aligned with the ED editor of
the MUST package version 2000 [123]. Nonsequenced
positions and gaps were coded as missing data. Phylogenetic reconstructions were performed on the complete
DNA data set by maximum likelihood (ML) with PAUP*
(version 4 beta 10) [124], and by Bayesian inference (BI)
with MrBayes (version 3.1.2) [125].

Modeltest 3.7 [126] was used to determine the sequence
evolution model that best fits our data using the Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC). This program examined the
fit of 56 models, with either a proportion of invariable
sites (I), a gamma distribution of substitution rate variation among-sites (G), or a combination of both (I + G).
To avoid excessive calculation times, our PAUP* ML analyses were conducted in two steps. A ML heuristic search
was first conducted by Tree Bisection Reconnection (TBR)
branch swapping to identify the optimal tree under
parameters estimated by Modeltest. This tree was re-used

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:199

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/199

for a new round of parameter estimation/branch swapping. This procedure was repeated until there was a stabilization of both topologies and parameters. The
robustness of nodes was estimated in PHYML [127] with
ML bootstrap percentages (BPML) estimated from 1000
pseudoreplicates using as a starting tree the best ML tree
obtained from PAUP. PHYML was preferred over PAUP*
for bootstrap analyses because of its rapidity. We also performed Bayesian Inference, as calculated by MrBayes, and
report Posterior Probabilities (PP) for recovered nodes.
For the Bayesian analysis we used 9 partitions, one for

Chronogram showing the posterior divergence ages within Murinae.
The topology corresponds with the ML tree in Figure 1. Divergence times
have been estimated from the concatenated Cytochrome b, IRBP and
GHR sequences by a Bayesian relaxed molecular clock method with two
fossil calibration time constraints (nodes indicated by a star).

Estimating dates of divergences
Divergence times were estimated for the optimum ML
topology. The hypothesis of a constant molecular clock
was tested by a Likelihood Ratio Test as proposed by
Felsenstein [128] and calculated in PAUP*4.0b10. We
used a relaxed Bayesian molecular clock approach as
implemented in MultiDivTime [129], using parameter
estimates derived with PAML [130] as described by Yoder
and Young [131]. Divergence times were estimated with
two fossil-based calibration intervals: 1) the Mus/Rattus
divergence set to between 10–12 Mya [65,66,132,133];
and 2) the divergence between Apodemus mystacinus and
all the species of subgenus Sylvaemus (A. flavicollis and A.
sylvaticus) set to a minimum of 7 Mya [51,78].
