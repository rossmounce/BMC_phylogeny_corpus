Abstract
Background: Molecular tools may help to uncover closely related and still diverging species from a wide
variety of taxa and provide insight into the mechanisms, pace and geography of marine speciation. There
is a certain controversy on the phylogeography and speciation modes of species-groups with an Eastern
Atlantic-Western Indian Ocean distribution, with previous studies suggesting that older events (Miocene)
and/or more recent (Pleistocene) oceanographic processes could have influenced the phylogeny of marine
taxa. The spiny lobster genus Palinurus allows for testing among speciation hypotheses, since it has a
particular distribution with two groups of three species each in the Northeastern Atlantic (P. elephas, P.
mauritanicus and P. charlestoni) and Southeastern Atlantic and Southwestern Indian Oceans (P. gilchristi, P.
delagoae and P. barbarae). In the present study, we obtain a more complete understanding of the
phylogenetic relationships among these species through a combined dataset with both nuclear and
mitochondrial markers, by testing alternative hypotheses on both the mutation rate and tree topology
under the recently developed approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods.
Results: Our analyses support a North-to-South speciation pattern in Palinurus with all the South-African
species forming a monophyletic clade nested within the Northern Hemisphere species. Coalescent-based
ABC methods allowed us to reject the previously proposed hypothesis of a Middle Miocene speciation
event related with the closure of the Tethyan Seaway. Instead, divergence times obtained for Palinurus
species using the combined mtDNA-microsatellite dataset and standard mutation rates for mtDNA agree
with known glaciation-related processes occurring during the last 2 my.
Conclusion: The Palinurus speciation pattern is a typical example of a series of rapid speciation events
occurring within a group, with very short branches separating different species. Our results support the
hypothesis that recent climate change-related oceanographic processes have influenced the phylogeny of
marine taxa, with most Palinurus species originating during the last two million years. The present study
highlights the value of new coalescent-based statistical methods such as ABC for testing different
speciation hypotheses using molecular data.

Background
The high dispersal potential of planktonic larvae usually
results in genetic homogeneity over large distances in
marine species, unless local adaptation or oceanographic
barriers counteract this dispersal [1]. Because of such dispersal potential, ranges of marine organisms have frequently been considered to be vast, even though marine
species can also exhibit cryptic speciation and fine-scale
endemism [2-4]. Allopatric speciation in marine organisms is mainly thought of a vicariance process, where a
species' geographic range becomes fragmented following
changes in oceanographic conditions or disconnection of
populations by lower sea levels, with a consequent divergence due to genetic drift [5]. However, allopatric speciation could also result from a founder effect, where a new
population is established by a small number of individuals, often by long-distance dispersal, with subsequent
restricted gene flow leading to speciation [6,7].
Spiny lobsters (Palinuridae Latreille, 1802) are one of the
most commercially significant groups of decapod crustaceans and they are considered key predators in a variety of
habitats [8-10]. The most striking feature of these lobsters
is their flat-bodied crystalline larval phase, the phyllosoma larva, which is specially adapted for dispersal in oceanic waters [11,12]. The phyllosoma larva has a long
planktonic life (up to 24 months) before metamorphosing into the puerulus stage, which is the transitional stage
to a benthic existence [13,14]. Since it is generally
assumed that such a long planktonic larval duration
should promote high levels of gene flow and effectively
counterbalance the speciation process [15,16], life history
traits make spiny lobsters a suitable model for better
understanding the speciation process in marine organisms with large dispersal capabilities.
The genus Palinurus, a typically temperate-water genus
within the Palinuridae [17], is particularly indicated for
such studies since it has a well-defined distribution with
two groups of three species each present in the Mediterranean and Northeastern Atlantic (P. elephas Fabricius,
1787, P. mauritanicus Gruvel, 1911, and P. charlestoni Forest and Postel, 1964) and Southeastern Atlantic and
Southwestern Indian Oceans (P. gilchristi Stebbing, 1900,
P. delagoae Barnard, 1926 and P. barbarae Groeneveld et al.
2006) (Figure 1). The phylogeny of Palinurus species has
been recently addressed using Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction methods on 16S and COI mtDNA sequences [18]. A strong
statistical support was found for the monophyly of each
species within the genus, but the interspecific relationships were poorly supported. Furthermore, Parsimony
and Maximum Likelihood analyses were congruent (in
some instances) while the Bayesian analyses failed to support any interspecific clustering, except for a P. delagoae/P.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/263

barbarae clade. Even though results were inconclusive, it
was pointed out that the Northern Hemisphere species P.
charlestoni could have been originated from a South-African ancestor colonizing Cape Verde islands. Therefore, it
has been proposed that the present geographical distribution of Palinurus species indicates a pre-Miocene allopatric
divergence, with two main lineages separating due to the
closure of the marine gateway between Mediterranean Sea
and Indian Ocean after the northward collision of Africa
with Eurasia (11.2-23 Mya) [19].
Such interpretation implies that Palinurus mtDNA (COI
and 16S rRNA combined) has evolved no faster than
0.18% (lower bound) to 0.36% (upper bound) per lineage per million years. Those rates of evolution would be
3-7 times slower than reported for other decapod taxa
[20], with Palinurus showing among the slowest mtDNA
mutation rate reported to date [18]. In relation to this
question, there is a certain controversy on the phylogeography and speciation modes of Eastern Atlantic and Western Indian Ocean species of several taxa, such as algae
[21], sea urchins [22] or fishes [23]. These studies suggest
that older events during the Miocene (e.g. the closure of
the Tethys Seaway) and/or recent oceanographic processes during the Pleistocene (e.g. Western Africa upwellings) could have influenced the phylogeny of marine taxa
[24,25]. For example, an extensive review of antitropical
biotas has shown that transequatorial migration is the
most likely explanation for the origin of antitropic distributions of most near-shore marine taxa [26]. A more complete understanding of the phylogenetic relationships
among Palinurus species will allow us to answer important
questions regarding the speciation processes in marine
taxa with an Eastern Atlantic and Western Indian Ocean
distribution.
The advantage of constructing phylogenetic trees from
genetic data has long been recognised, with the most
widely used software in the field being MrBayes [27].
Moreover, it has more recently been appreciated that population genetic processes can lead to incongruence
between the species tree and the genetic tree [28], for
which new software considering separately the likelihood
of the data given the gene tree and the likelihood of the
gene tree given the species tree has been developed on top
of MrBayes (BEST [29,30]). This software allows for better
estimation of species trees from population genetic data,
but the program can be applied strictly to sequence data.
Since microsatellite markers allow for simultaneously
sampling different genome regions, we opted to use a
novel package that can deal with both sequence data and
microsatellites jointly through the use of an approximate
Bayesian computation (ABC) method [31].

Therefore, the present study aims to ascertain phylogenetic relationships and monophyly patterns in species of
the genus Palinurus from Eastern Atlantic and Western
Indian Ocean using mitochondrial DNA sequence data
and a set of 13 microsatellite markers. In order to solve the
phylogenetic tree topology and test among opposite evolutionary hypotheses (Figure 2), we will use both classic
distance-based and recently developed coalescent-based
approximate Bayesian computation methods, which have
been successfully used to trace complex colonizing scenarios [32]. Coalescent-based methods will allow us to define
the likelihood for different mutation rates and tree topologies to have produced the observed dataset and consequently test the importance of an older mechanism (i.e.
closure of marine gateway) versus more recent oceanographic processes in the origin of Palinurus species.

Methods
Taxon sampling and genotyping
DNA was obtained from P. elephas (n = 331; [33]), P. mauritanicus (n = 17; Atlantic Morocco; [33]), P. charlestoni (n
= 5; Cape Verde Islands; [34]), P. gilchristi (n = 20; Southcoast South Africa; [35]), P. delagoae (n = 20; S-KZN2
South Africa; [36]) and P. barbarae (n = 18; Madagascar
Ridge: Walters Shoals; [36]). Multiplex PCR amplification
using the polymorphic microsatellite loci isolated from P.
elephas was carried out under conditions described in
Palero and Pascual [37]. Amplified products were scored
using an ABI 3770 automatic sequencer from the University of Barcelona Scientific and Technical Services. Alleles

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/263

were sized by PeakScanner™ software, with an internal
size marker CST Rox 70-500 (BioVentures Inc.). The 16S
rRNA and COI sequences were obtained as in [18] and
Palero et al. [33,38]. All samples and microsatellite markers included in Palero [34] were used for classic distancebased analysis, while the combined dataset including
mtDNA sequence data and 10 microsatellite loci (after
excluding Pael22, Pael31 and Pael44 since they do not follow a "stepwise" change in allele size) was used for coalescent-based ABC analysis.
Classic distance-based methods
We employed CONVERT 1.2 to transform the excel-based
microsatellites dataset into different formats to be run by
other population genetic programs [39]. Genetic diversity
and pairwise differentiation estimates (FST) for microsatellite data were obtained using the GENEPOP package version 4.0.7 [40], while average GTR corrected sequence
divergence was obtained for mtDNA data as in [18]. Since
different genetic markers can provide conflicting phylogenetic signals, a Mantel test was carried out correlating the
genetic distance matrix obtained from mtDNA sequence
data and the Fst distance matrix based on microsatellites.
This will allow us to check for congruence among markers
and for the possibility of combining them in a joint dataset. Isolation by distance patterns were evaluated by correlating geographic distance and each genetic distance
through the Mantel test. If Palinurus speciation had
occurred following a gradual North-to-South pattern, we
would expect species most closely located geographically

to be those separated by a smaller genetic distance,
whereas we would expect a vicariance event and posterior
contact between phylogenetically distant species (topology 2) to reduce the correlation between genetic and geographic distance matrices. The rows and columns of one
of the matrices were subjected to 700 random permutations, with correlation being recalculated after each permutation. The Mantel test analysis for a multiple set of
distance matrices has been implemented in R and is available from the authors upon request. Finally, the distance
measure of Cavalli-Sforza and Edwards [41] was obtained
from the combined mtDNA-microsatellite dataset by coding mtDNA haplotypes as individual alleles, and phylogenetic trees (based on individuals or species) were built
using the Neighbor Joining algorithm as implemented in
Populations v1.2.30 http://bioinformatics.org/~tryphon/
populations/. The distance-based method has been
shown to be among the most robust methods for phylogenetic reconstruction using microsatellite data [42-44]. A
total of 1000 bootstrap replicates over loci were obtained
to asses support for each clade. Previous phylogenetic
analyses indicate that the species found in the Northernmost part of the distribution area of the genus, Palinurus
elephas, is the most basal species of the group and therefore it has been used to root the trees [18,38].
Approximate Bayesian computation implementation
When inferring phylogenies under the "Isolation with
migration" model [45], likelihoods can only be computed
for relatively simple scenarios containing few parameters
[46]. Indeed, the likelihood function for complex demographic scenarios can be very difficult, and practically
impossible, to solve analytically [47]. For this reason,
application of ABC methods to solve phylogenetic inference-related problems has become of great interest [4850]. ABC methods have the advantage of facilitating the
comparison of alternative models marginal to parameter
values without the need for calculating likelihoods [51].
The method relies on the simulation of large numbers of
data sets using known parameters under a given coalescent model, for which it is more realistic than standard
sequence-based phylogenetic approaches [30,52].

When dealing with coalescent-based inference, we rely on
simulating genetic data based on a coalescence model and
computing summary statistics from simulated datasets. A
typical ABC approach involves two steps [51]: a rejection
step and a regression adjustment and weighting step. The
rejection step consists of accepting only the simulations
whose summary statistics are close to the summary statistics obtained from the observed dataset. To assess this
closeness, a Euclidian distance is computed between the
entire set of normalized summary statistics and the normalized summary statistics calculated from the data. A set
of parameter values is accepted when its Euclidian dis-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/263

tance is within a certain percentage of the closest points to
the studied data (as in [53]). The second step is a local linear regression adjustment that attempts to model the relationship between the parameter values and the summary
statistics. This linear regression is performed only for the
accepted set of parameter values. We assume that the relation between parameters and summary statistics is close to
linear in the proximity of the target summary statistics. By
using this adjustment, more points can be accepted,
which allows a better characterization of the space problem [52]. Also in this step, each accepted set of parameter
values is given a weight between zero and one that
declines quadratically until a defined distance from the
studied data set is reached (as in [48]).
To reduce heteroscedasticity in the regression, all demographic parameter values were transformed on a log scale.
The transformed parameter values were adjusted one at a
time using a general linear regression on the accepted
points. Adjusted values were then back-transformed taking the exponential for all parameters, in order to present
posterior densities on a normal scale [51,52]. The transformation also minimizes the appearance of values outside the prior ranges after performing the linear-regression
correction. Previous studies indicated that the logistic and
related transformations can lead to biases in the posterior
densities estimated in the proximity of the prior boundaries under particular circumstances [31]. To avoid this
problem we choose a log transformation, which still
allows for points at the lower boundary to be retained
within the support of the model. In this case, the points
that fell outside the upper boundary after regression were
discarded, since this procedure has been shown to give a
more efficient estimation [31].
A standard backward coalescent process was implemented
to simulate genetic data [54,55]. Simulated data are
obtained by adding mutations under a stepwise mutation
model [56] for short tandem repeats (STRs) and an infinite sites model [57] for sequence data. Hamilton and coworkers [58] suggest running several hundreds of thousands to millions of simulations, depending on the complexity of the underlying model. In our simulations
1,000,000 values of the summary statistics sets were generated and a tolerance δ = 0.01 was used to give 10,000
points from which parameters were estimated. When performing model-choice between the suggested different
scenarios 2,000,000 points were simulated and a tolerance of δ = 0.005 was used. We used the mode of the posterior distributions as a point estimate of the parameter.
Credible intervals were calculated around the mode, following previous studies by Hamilton et al. [58] and Beaumont [53].

The model-choice studies were performed by first carrying
out the simulation in parallel on a 24-node cluster, and
then combining the simulated output, in order to shorten
the simulation time. A program developed by Lopes and
co-workers was used to simulate genetic data in an "Isolation with migration" model for any number of modern
populations [31]. This software allows the use of STR's
and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data simultaneously. The regression step was performed using a script
developed
by
Beaumont
(makepd.r,
http://
www.rubic.rdg.ac.uk/~mab/) under the free software
environment R v2.5.0 [59]. The posterior density estimation from the adjusted sample of parameter values was
carried out using the locfit function [60].
Prior distributions of parameters
The same priors for the demographic parameters (current
and ancestral effective sizes following a uniform distribution ranging from 1,000 to 100,000) were used for inferences based on the North-to-South speciation model
(topology 1), and those based on South-to-North speciation model (topology 2, with P. charlestoni originating
from a south-african ancestor) (Figure 2). The priors for
the demographic parameters were chosen according to
information available from the literature [34,35,61]. The
priors for the splitting time estimates also followed a uniform prior, as indicated in Table 1. Mutation rates for each
locus were treated as a nuisance parameter. Although we
intended to differentiate between standard and slow
mutation rates, it was not intended to infer their exact values. Therefore, a broad prior was used for the loci mutation rates to account for the uncertainty on the estimates.
The variation in mutation rate between loci was
accounted for by using a hierarchical Bayesian framework
[62]. The mutation rates for each locus were drawn from
a lognormal distribution (priors) with mean sampled
from a normal distribution and the standard deviation
being the absolute value sampled also from a normal distribution (hyper-priors) [53]. In order to cover the pro-

posed limits of the mutation rate, we used a standard
deviation hyperprior of 0.25 and chose for mtDNA a
mean Standard mutation rate of 2.34 × 10-5 (log = 4.630784) and a Slow mutation rate of 5.4 × 10-6 (log = 5.267606) (Table 1). The use of hyper-parameters within
ABC methods has been previously described [48,53,63].
Choice of summary statistics
The summary statistics were chosen according to their success in previous ABC studies [49,53]. For mtDNA, 3 summary statistics were calculated for each sampled deme:
number of haplotypes, k; number of segregating sites, S;
and the average number of pairwise differences, π. For STR
data, three within-deme summary statistics were calculated for each sampled deme: allele number, k; heterozygosity, H; and variance in allele length, Var(length). All
this 6 statistics were computed for each of the six populations taken individually and for each of the fifteen pairs of
populations pooled together. Hence, the Euclidian distances were computed from a total of 126 normalized
summary statistics.
Comparison of scenarios using approximate Bayesian
computation
In order to test between previously proposed hypotheses
(Figure 2), we considered four scenarios which differed in
the population tree topology and in the prior distribution
on the mutation rate: (1) sequential expansion from the
Northern hemisphere and considering a normal prior distribution centred on a standard mutation rate (PliocenePleistocene speciation); (2) North-to-South expansion,
but considering a normal prior distribution centred on a
slow mutation rate (Miocene speciation); (3) secondary
colonization of the Northern hemisphere, with P. charlestoni originating from a P. gilchristi-like ancestor and considering a normal prior distribution centred on a standard
mutation rate; and (4) secondary colonization of the
Northern hemisphere but considering a normal prior distribution centred on a slow mutation rate. Therefore, an

ABC framework was used to discriminate among our four
different scenarios. This model-selection step was performed before estimating the final demographic historic
parameters, which were done conditional to the most
likely scenario. The prior probability for each scenario in
all the comparisons were set to be equal (i.e. 1/2 for each
two-scenario comparison). The posterior probability of
each model was then estimated by performing the rejection-step followed by a logistic regression [53]. Priors for
divergence times were made broad enough to consider
both a Miocene and a Pleistocene speciation pattern
(Table 1).
Beaumont [53] indicated that it is possible to sample the
model indicator (i.e. {1, 2,..., m}) for "m" models (M1,
M2,..., Mm) from a prior and treat this as a categorical random variable, X, in the ABC simulations. We can then
apply a categorical regression to estimate P(X = x1|S = s'),
where x = 1, 2,..., m is the indicator for model Mx and s' is
the vector of the summary statistics that summarize our
observed data. A scheme of weighting can also be used,
with weights given by the Epanechnikov kernel, as done
in a standard regression procedure. The regression-step
was performed using Beaumont's R script calmod http://
www.rubic.rdg.ac.uk/~mab, which needs the VGAM package [64]. This procedure has been shown to substantially
improve previous methods to select among different
models using ABC [49,53].

Results
Classic distance-based methods
All microsatellite markers were polymorphic in every
tested species with the exception of PE10 in P. barbarae
(Additional file 1). A Mantel test (R = 0.626; P = 0.003)
revealed a significant correlation between the genetic distance matrix obtained from mtDNA sequence data and
that obtained from microsatellites (Additional file 2).
Moreover, the correlation between the matrix of geographic distance and each genetic distance matrix was
always significant although higher for the microsatellite
dataset (R = 0.585; P = 0.001) than for the mtDNA dataset
(R = 0.237; P = 0.033). The distance measure of CavalliSforza and Edwards showed a southern hemisphere species clade and agrees with placing P. charlestoni samples
next to P. elephas samples when phylogenetic trees are
built using the individual-based matrices and the Neighbor Joining algorithm (Figure 3). When dealing with species instead of individuals, a well supported
monophyletic southern hemisphere clade was obtained
as well, even though phylogenetic relationships among
northern hemisphere species were not completely
resolved (Figure 4).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/263

ABC methods
The posterior distributions of model comparisons are presented in Table 2. The simulations obtained using distributions centered on the slow and standard mutation rate
allowed us to check for which mutation rate has a higher
posterior probability regardless topology (Table 2a). The
tests for mutation rate of both topology models gave a
better support for a standard mutation rate. This support
is fairly strong, giving about 90% of probability of having
a standard mutation rate. After testing for the mutation
rate, the comparison of topologies assuming a particular
mutation rate distribution allows us to check for which
topology presents a higher posterior probability. The
comparisons between the two different speciation models
(Figure 2) considering the standard mutation rate strongly
support the North-to-South speciation model (Table 2b).
Therefore, the most likely scenario was a standard mutation rate and topology 1. According to the model comparison results, demographic parameters were estimated by
conditioning the ABC runs to the most supported model
(North-to-South speciation with a standard mutation
rate).

Estimations of modern population effective sizes using
both mitochondrial sequences and microsatellite markers
pointed to about 50,000 individuals for populations of P.
barbarae, P. delagoae, P. gilchristi and P. elephas and
between 80,000 to 100,000 individuals for P. mauritanicus
and P. charlestoni (Table 3). Estimates of effective size of
the ancestor populations were not very informative given
the large confidence intervals obtained (Additional file 3).
The estimation of the second ancestor population though
had a quite informative posterior distribution, showing a
value of about 10,000 individuals. This ancestor population refers to the original population from the South African coast that later originated P. gilchristi and from which
P. barbarae and P. delagoae originated from. This value corresponds to the effective population size, so it is not
straightforward to infer the census population size from it.
Nevertheless, these results seem to point out an expansion
event of the referred south-African ancestral population.
In this ABC study, the estimates of demographic parameters which had a better support were the ones regarding
splitting time. When conditioning for a North-to-South
speciation pattern, all five splitting times showed a posterior distribution considerably different from the prior and
quite tight around the mode (Table 3). Accordingly, the
splitting time when both P. elephas and P. mauritanicus
were originated was placed around 2 million years ago
(mya), separation between P. mauritanicus and P. charlestoni lineages took place about 1 mya, colonization of
South Africa would have taken place only 0.5 mya, and
the appearance of both P. delagoae and P. barbarae would
be placed at about 0.2 mya and 0.1 mya, respectively.

Discussion
Our within-genus phylogenetic analyses using a new set of
polymorphic nuclear loci and classic distance-based
methods consistently support a North-to-South pattern of
speciation in Palinurus with all the South African species
forming a monophyletic clade (topology 1; Figures 2, 4).
Moreover, the combination of nuclear and mtDNA markers under recently developed coalescent-based ABC meth-

ods has allowed us to test for the previously suggested
hypothesis of P. charlestoni originating from a P. gilchristilike ancestor [18]. It is known that when we are interested
in the old events in a gene's history, small samples are sufficient, while if we are interested in recent events then
larger sample sizes are critical [65]. Even though a larger
sample size would allow us to better characterize the coalescent properties for each species (e.g. times to coales-

cence), and we were able to obtain only 5 P. charlestoni
samples from Cape Verde Islands, our results show that a
North-to-South speciation pattern occurring during the
last 2 my is more consistent with the observed dataset.
A previous phylogeographic study using the COI region
and standard rates for decapod crustaceans [33] found
divergence times for P. elephas and P. mauritanicus to be
much more recent [18]. Also, a previous study on the
Achelata infraorder evolutionary relationships showed no
genetic variation to be present among most Palinurus species when analyzed using sequence data from several
nuclear genes [38]. These results already suggested that
the speciation process within the genus Palinurus is fairly
recent and therefore not related with the Middle Miocene
closure of the Tethyan Seaway. In agreement with previous evidence, the coalescent simulations carried out in the

present study indicate that the observed molecular dataset
is not likely to result from a low mutation rate, while the
standard mutation rate is supported regardless of the speciation hypothesis assumed. Most interestingly, divergence time estimates obtained for Palinurus species using
standard rates agree with known glaciation-related processes occurring over the last 2 my [66].
The late Pliocene changes in the climate system, both in
the Northern and the Southern Hemisphere, had a large
impact on the evolution of many terrestrial organisms
[67]. The gradual closure of the Panama Isthmus between
5 and 3 mya stopped the exchange of tropical Atlantic and
Pacific water masses and the present day overall circulation pattern was established, with a strong influence of
North Atlantic Deep Water on the global circulation and
intensification of the Benguela Current upwelling system

[66,68]. The Matuyama diatom maximum (~2 mya)
marked the transition to a cold mode of trade-wind controlled upwelling along the Southwest African coast with
enhanced advection of sub-Antarctic water masses [69].
Marlow et al. [70] have shown that the Benguela Current
upwelling system became pronounced at 2.1 to 1.9 mya
and intensified during the period leading to the onset of
the 100 ky glacial cycles at about 0.6 mya. Consequently,
the intensification of Benguela Current upwelling had a
direct regional influence by cooling the marine waters of
southern Africa, with average sea surface temperature
shifting from about 26°C in the mid-Pliocene (3.5 mya)
to approximately 11-17°C in the present [24,70]. This
could have facilitated the colonization of southern Africa
from the North, since temperate-water Palinurus species
are generally found between 11-16°C [9,18]. Interestingly, ABC divergence time estimates for the separation of
P. charlestoni and P. gilchristi lineages would correspond to
about 550 ky ago, after Southwest African waters became
suitable for Palinurus species.
Even though the results obtained in previous studies provide comforting genealogical support to the classical view
of species as qualitatively distinct taxa [18,71], the reconstruction provided by mtDNA is not representative of
most of the genome and may bias perceptions of evolutionary diversification [72]. The demographic context of
differentiation is not taken into account in most mtDNA
studies because single loci offer low precision on estimates of historical population size [28] and because the
relatively shallow coalescent time for this molecule limits
the temporal window for demographic inferences [73].
For a given divergence time, historical population size is a
key factor determining whether a species is polymorphic
at most loci and whether genes are expected to accurately

trace the species phylogeny. It is widely recognized that
large populations undergoing rapid speciation, such as in
some marine species, could create intermingled genealogical tracings containing very little phylogenetic information among species divergence [74].
Some doubts had been previously raised on the phylogenetic relationships of the extant species of the spiny lobster genus Palinurus, since they show very few
morphological differences, with overlaps between the
Indian and Atlantic Ocean taxa [75]. In fact, most Palinurus species cannot be discriminated using sequences for
several nuclear coding genes and P. delagoae and P. gilchristi have been found to share 16S haplotypes [18,33].
Even though nesting of some individuals within a different species may be caused by some microsatellites being
identical in allele-size without being identical by descent
(homoplasy), the results obtained from individual-based
analyses using mtDNA and microsatellite markers indicate that monophyly patterns in P. delagoae and P. barbarae are not well supported (Figure 3). The coalescent
theory has shown that polyphyletic gene lineages can persist in species long enough after divergence [72,76]. With
an ancestral population effective size of about 20,000 [34]
and a generation time of 4-10 years [36], an average of
160-400 ky would be needed for gene lineages to get fixed
in Palinurus species. This would be in agreement with
divergence time estimates obtained from the combined
dataset, since individual-based analyses show that incomplete lineage sorting is most pronounced in the most
recently evolved species pair, P. delagoae and P. barbarae
(divergence time: ~89 kyr).

Conclusion
The combination of markers from both nuclear and mitochondrial genomes under an ABC-coalescent framework
has proven to be effective for testing among alternative
evolutionary hypotheses in Palinurus and highlights the
importance of using multiple markers when dealing with
closely-related species. The Palinurus speciation pattern is
a typical example of a series of rapid speciation events
occurring within a group, with very short branches separating different species. Therefore, it has been shown that
molecular tools can provide new insights into the mechanisms, pace and geography of marine speciation. Indeed,
recent genetic evidence suggests that many species groups
are relatively new, originating after the onset of the Pleistocene, during the last two million years [5,77]. These
recent speciation events provide a great opportunity to
analyze the speciation process in marine taxa, since footprints of species formation are most likely to be identified
when comparing recently diverged species, the initial differentiation of which can be correlated with the different
proposed speciation processes.
