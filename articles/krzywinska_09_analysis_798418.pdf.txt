Abstract
Background: Male mosquitoes do not feed on blood and are not involved in delivery of pathogens
to humans. Consequently, they are seldom the subjects of research, which results in a very poor
understanding of their biology. To gain insights into male developmental processes we sought to
identify genes transcribed exclusively in the reproductive tissues of male Anopheles gambiae pupae.
Results: Using a cDNA subtraction strategy, five male-specifically or highly male-biased expressed
genes were isolated, four of which remain unannotated in the An. gambiae genome. Spatial and
temporal expression patterns suggest that each of these genes is involved in the mid-late stages of
spermatogenesis. Their sequences are rapidly evolving; however, two genes possess clear
homologs in a wide range of taxa and one of these probably acts in a sperm motility control
mechanism conserved in many organisms, including humans. The other three genes have no match
to sequences from non-mosquito taxa, thus can be regarded as orphans. RNA in situ hybridization
demonstrated that one of the orphans is transcribed in spermatids, which suggests its involvement
in sperm maturation. Two other orphans have unknown functions. Expression analysis of orthologs
of all five genes indicated that male-biased transcription was not conserved in the majority of cases
in Aedes and Culex.
Conclusion: Discovery of testis-expressed orphan genes in mosquitoes opens new prospects for
the development of innovative control methods. The orphan encoded proteins may represent
unique targets of selective anti-mosquito sterilizing agents that will not affect non-target organisms.

Background
Mosquitoes transmit devastating infectious diseases that
kill up to three million people and debilitate hundreds of
millions every year [1]. Large-scale control campaigns
have been attempted to lessen this enormous burden, but
despite initial promise they have become increasingly
inefficient – largely because of emergence and spread of
drug resistance in pathogens and insecticide resistance in
the mosquito vectors. As a result, the numbers of cases of

mosquito-borne diseases is rising [2,3], which points to
an urgent need to devise more effective control strategies.
Developing novel mosquito-based approaches requires
an extensive knowledge of mosquito biology. The ecology, population genetics, molecular biology, and genomics of Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti, major vectors of
malaria and yellow fever/dengue, respectively, have been
intensively studied in recent years, which culminated in
sequencing of their genomes [4,5]. However, many

aspects of their biology relevant to control efforts remain
poorly understood.
The life cycle of vector mosquitoes depends on a proteinrich bloodmeal required for egg development, and
repeated blood feeding assists in the transmission of pathogens. Because only female mosquitoes are involved in
these processes, laboratory research efforts have been
directed almost exclusively at understanding the female
physiology and molecular biology, with the goal of identifying features that may be used in innovative interventions to fight the diseases [6]. However, when control
methods, aiming either at reduction of mosquito populations or population replacement, are considered, males
cannot be ignored and their characteristics, including
male-specific transcripts and proteins should also be
viewed as potential targets. In this respect, genes expressed
in male reproductive organs are of particular interest for
three reasons. First, their protein products may constitute
suitable targets of novel classes of agents that would cause
male sterility. Theoretically, male-sterilizing insecticides
may be superior to the currently used ones. In several animal groups, including insects, male-expressed genes
evolve significantly faster than female-biased genes, or
those with sex-unbiased expression [7], and a number of
genes expressed in testes have been hypothesized to originate in recently evolved lineages [8,9]. Therefore, insecticides affecting proteins involved in spermatogenesis may
target exclusively mosquitoes and be harmless to non-target organisms. Moreover, mutations causing resistance to
such insecticides would probably seriously affect fertility
and individuals carrying the mutations would be quickly
eliminated from the population. Second, cis-regulatory
sequences of genes expressed in male germline may be
used in genetic control strategies as elements of gene drive
system to spread desired characteristics, such as resistance
to pathogens, into wild mosquito populations. Several
driving systems, based on activity of selfish genetic elements, have been proposed [10] and major advances have
been made in the creation of modified transposons and
homing endonucleases [11]. However, to be spread to
subsequent generations, such selfish elements must be
activated in the germ line; moreover, they should be
restricted to these tissues to limit the mutagenic effects of
transposition in soma, which may reduce the fitness of
transgenic mosquitoes [12]. Two genes, oskar and nanos,
expressed in the female germ line were proposed as candidates for donating regulatory sequences to control modified transposons in mosquitoes [12,13], and the
regulatory elements of nanos have been demonstrated to
mediate transposition in A. aegypti in a developmentally
regulated manner [14]. Homing endonucleases have
never been found in animals; however, the activity of fungus-derived enzymes have recently been reported in An.
gambiae [11,15]. The potential of driving transgenes using

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/300

male germ line promoters remains to be tested, but any
such attempt is hampered by inadequate information
about testis-specific expression patterns. Third, such genes
may be targeted to induce male sterility in an improved
sterile insect technique [16].
Several microarray analyses explored differential gene
expression between adult female and male mosquitoes,
providing a genome-wide overview of male-biased expression [5,17-19]. Moreover, in silico analysis identified a
number of genes expressed in the adult male accessory
glands [20]. However, information about gene expression
in testes is almost completely lacking, the only exception
being the analysis of b2 tubulin gene, earlier identified to
be testes-specific in Drosophila [21], and found to have
conserved testes expression in Aedes aegypti [22], An. gambiae [11], and Anopheles stephensi [23].
To gain a better understanding of gene expression in
males we targeted transcripts from the reproductive tissues of Anopheles gambiae male pupae. Using a cDNA subtraction strategy we identified five genes, whose spatial
and temporal patterns of transcription suggest involvement in the late phases of spermatogenesis. Comparative
genomic analysis revealed that three of these genes have
homologs detectable only in mosquitoes, suggesting that
they have a rapid evolutionary rate or have a relatively
recent origin in the mosquito lineage. The two other genes
have homologs in a wide range of taxa, with which they
share short conserved sequence regions; one of these
genes may have a highly conserved function in controlling
sperm flagellum motility. In addition to in silico sequence
analyses, we conducted an analysis of ortholog expression
in three mosquito species and discovered substantial differences in expression profiles of three genes, which in
Aedes and Culex are expressed in a sex-unbiased pattern.

Results and Discussion
Isolation of male-specific transcripts by suppressive
subtractive hybridization
Enrichment of male transcripts was done using a suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) strategy, in which
fragmented male cDNA was ligated to adaptor sequences
and subjected to liquid hybridization with an excess of
female cDNA. Subsequently, a selective amplification of
the male-specific cDNA was performed in two rounds of
PCR using external and nested primers complementary to
the adaptors. The second round of PCR performed using
nested primers yielded 23 fragments, ranging in size from
200 bp to > 2 kb, discernible on a smeary background
upon fractionation on an agarose gel (data not shown).
Each fragment was excised from the gel, cloned, and
sequenced. The sequences were subjected to BLASTN
searches against NCBI's Anopheles gambiae EST collection
to eliminate transcripts known to be expressed in female

tissues. The sequences that had no match to female ESTs
were tested by RT-PCR for male-specific expression using
pupal male and female total RNAs as a template. Five
sequences showed strong expression in male pupae and
were analyzed further (see Additional file 1 for details on
sequences not included in further analysis).
The SSH strategy implemented yields fragments of
cDNAs. The full-length sequences were assembled following identification of the transcripts' ends using 5' and 3'
RACE and found to correspond to five different genes.
Four of those do not match any An. gambiae gene predictions and only a fragment of one gene has previously been
predicted to encode an An. gambiae protein (VectorBase
An. gambiae gene build AgamP3.4). Basic sequence characteristics of each gene are presented in Table 1; their
cDNA sequences are available in GenBank under accession nos. FJ869232–FJ869243. The putative full-length
protein-coding regions were used as queries in TBLASTN
searches for their homologs in other organisms. Orthologous sequences of all five genes were identified in the
Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus genomes. Two of
those genes also have putative orthologs in a wide range

of taxa, including humans, in which they encode poorly
characterized or uncharacterized proteins; here we name
them AgRopn1l and AgDzip1l, after their putative human
orthologs. Three genes, named here mts (mosquito testis
specific), Ams (Anopheles male specific) and AAms (Anopheles and Aedes male specific), code for proteins that exhibit
no similarity to any GenBank entry derived from nonmosquito taxa, and as such they are regarded as orphan
genes. They may have originated in the mosquito lineage
or have been under a strong positive selection resulting in
a rapid evolutionary rate and divergence from their nonmosquito orthologs beyond detection using the TBLASTN
search.
Expression profiling of male-specific genes
The temporal profile of gene expression was evaluated by
RT-PCR using total RNA templates isolated separately
from male and female An. gambiae sampled from each
postembryonic developmental stage. For each gene the
expression was practically limited to male pupae and
adults (Figure 1A). There was comparable mRNA abundance in pupae and adults or a slight increase was
observed in two-day-old adult males and subsequently

instar larvae; P, pupae; A, adults. (B) Male tissue expression. H, head; T, thorax; A, abdomen; Md, midgut; Mt, Malpighian
tubules; Ts, testes; Ag, accessory glands. Apart from AAms, the primers used for RT-PCR were designed to span intron regions,
which allows an easy recognition of the RT-PCR signal from the amplified traces of genomic DNA contaminating the RNA samples despite DNase treatment (cf. Ams products, in which the weak upper band represents the DNA amplified from a genomic
template and the lower band corresponds to cDNA fragmens). The low level of signal in AAms likely originates from residues of
genomic DNA, because the amplified fragment spans an exclusively exonic region. For each sample 28 amplification cycles
were performed, apart from 32 cycles for AAms in dissected tissues to visualize the short transcript. S7 was amplified in 24
cycles.
maintained at that level until at least 10 days post emergence (data not shown). An evident departure from this
pattern was found in the AgDzip1l profile, in which a low
level of expression was ubiquitously present in male larvae and all female stages in addition to a strong expression
in pupae and adult males. Moreover, an earlier onset of
transcription, during the fourth larval instar, was detected
for the Ams gene (cf. a faint band in a L4 male lane, Figure
1A).
The spatial expression pattern was analyzed using RT-PCR
and, for two selected genes (Ams and mts), using wholemount RNA in situ hybridization to the male reproductive
tissues. Total RNA from the undissected head, thorax and
abdomen, and dissected abdominal tissues of adult males
served as templates for RT-PCR experiments. Relatively
abundant transcripts of each gene were detected in the
abdomen, where most of the expression was apparently
limited to the testes (Figure 1B). Various amounts of RTPCR products were also detected in the accessory gland
samples. In situ experiments confirmed the localization of
the Ams and mts transcripts in the testes, however, no
hybridization signal was evident in the accessory glands

(Figure 2); this hybridization pattern likely holds for the
other three genes not examined using RNA in situ method.
While a low level of transcription in the gland tissue cannot be excluded (note a relatively high background in the
in situ experiments), it is possible that the RT-PCR product
in those samples is an experimental artifact, arising from
the reproductive tissue dissection method. First, some testis RNA carry-over to the accessory gland samples could
have occurred during dissection. Second, because the
accessory glands were excised with fragments of vasa deferentia and seminal vesicles, which in adult males may contain mature sperm, it is likely that the transcripts detected
in the accessory gland RNA samples have actually originated from the spermatozoa. Indeed, for both genes
tested by in situ hybridization, a faint signal is present in
the testis sperm reservoir (Figure 2A, C; Additional file 1).
The retention of a complex mRNA population in the ejaculated sperm is well documented in humans, but is
known to occur in the male gametes of many species [24].
We assume that the expression detected in the late preimaginal stages is, as in adult males, limited to the reproductive tissues.

RNA in situ hybridization analysis of expression of the Ams and mts genes in the An. gambiae male reproductive tissues
Figure 2
RNA in situ hybridization analysis of expression of the Ams and mts genes in the An. gambiae male reproductive
tissues. (A) Hybridization of the Ams antisense probe reveals that abundant transcripts are present in primary and secondary
spermatocytes; afterwards the transcripts are gradually degraded, but persist at low level in spermatozoa (small solid arrow).
(B) Hybridization of the sense Ams probe produces no signal. (C) Hybridization of the mts antisense probe shows active transcription of the gene in primary spermatocytes and spermatids, and persistence of the transcripts in spermatozoa (small solid
arrow). (D) Hybridization of the mts sense probe produces no signal. On each photograph testes are located on the right and
accesory glands with ejaculatory duct on the left. Within testis germ cells of the same developmental phase are encased in a
single cyst. Unstained apical part of each testis, containing the youngest germ cells, points to the right. The leftmost compartment (encompassed by brackets in insets) represents a sperm reservoir with mature spermatozoa. The low background seen
in all samples originates from the color reaction induced by endogenous lysosomal alkaline phosphatases. Note that a stronger
background in the accessory gland basal lobes, containing denser granular tissue (arrow), is present in all samples, regardless of
the probe used for hybridization.

The localization and timing of transcription suggests that
the identified genes are involved in the mid-late phases of
spermatogenesis. Spermatogenesis proceeds in succession
from primordial germ cells differentiated in the embryo,
through primary and secondary spermatogonia, primary
and secondary spermatocytes, to spermatids and, ultimately, spermatozoa [25]. The last step in this process,
called spermiogenesis and involving cytodifferentiation
of round spermatids into long mature spermatozoa, is
particularly complex. In mosquitoes spermiogenesis is
thought to occur mainly during the pupal stage, but considerable temporal variation of this process exists in differ-

ent mosquito groups [25]. In Anopheles, spermatogenesis
progression has been described in the fourth instar larvae,
pupae and newly emerged adults of a European species
An. atroparvus (subgenus Anopheles) [26] and, indirectly,
in adults of An. culicifacies [27], An. gambiae [28], and An.
stephensi [29] (all three from subgenus Cellia). In An.
atroparvus spermatogenesis progression is fast, with the
first spermatozoa observed in the 96 hours old fourth
instar larvae [26]. All phases of spermatogenesis still occur
in young pupae, in which early germ cells occupy the apical part and maturing spermatozoa the posterior part of
the testis. In late pupae and newly emerged adults most of

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:300

the testicular cell population is represented by mature
sperm bundles. In contrast, in representatives of Cellia
spermatogenesis continues well into the adult stage. In
newly emerged males over half of the testis is occupied by
spermatocysts containing immature germ cells at different
stages of development. With age, posterior-most spermatocysts mature and rupture to release spermatozoa, resulting in an increasing proportion of testis occupied by the
sperm reservoir. In virgin males the rate of spermatogenesis progressively slows down, however, mating-associated
sperm depletion leads to an increase in the number of
spermatocysts, indicative of a capacity of adults to rapidly
resume spermatogenesis [29]. Age-related changes in the
numbers of spermatozoa have not been studied in Anopheles, but in virgin males of Ae. aegypti the sperm count
increases more than two-fold between day 1 and day 10
after eclosion [30].
To date, b2 tubulin remains the only gene reported to be
testis-specific in An. gambiae. Similar to Drosophila b2 tubulin [21], it presumably functions in meiotic spindle formation, sperm cell shaping, and axoneme assembly, and is
activated in primary spermatocytes during the late third
instar larval stage [11]. The genes identified in our study
are activated in fourth instar larvae or pupae, but their
expression is also initiated in the (late) primary spermatocytes, as demonstrated by RNA in situ hybridization to
Ams and mts transcripts (Figure 2). Interestingly, hybridization patterns of these two transcripts differ, indicating
involvement of each gene in different spermatogenic
processes. Ams transcript abundance persists unchanged
in secondary spermatocytes and is later gradually reduced.
The mts transcripts are partially eliminated in the secondary spermatocyte stage, but, unexpectedly, their level is
significantly increased in spermatids. It is generally
believed that in Drosophila genes required during meiosis
and all post-meiotic spermatogenic processes are transcribed exclusively in primary spermatocytes and stored in
the cytoplasm for later use. However, transcription of 24
genes has been recently detected in the fly's spermatids
[31], similar to the mts gene.
A relatively late onset of expression with respect to the
spermatogenic program suggests that the promoters of the
identified genes may not be optimal for driving transgenes in genetic mosquito control strategies. However,
absence of data on gene regulation in mosquito testes
prompted us to search for the putative testis-specific cisregulatory elements. For this purpose we used the pattern
discovery tool from RSAT program to identify overrepresented hexa-, hepta- and octamer motifs in the 2 kb
regions upstream from the putative translation start sites
of the five genes. No significantly overrepresented motifs
common to all sequences were found, however, 5' flanks
of four genes contained a CGTTGAA heptamer. Its signifi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/300

cance remains to be tested, but it should be noted that a
putative regulatory motif with similar sequence
(ACGTTGA) has been identified in a screen of upstream
regions of all orthologous genes annotated in Anopheles,
Aedes and Culex genomes [32].
Intriguingly, the AgRopn1l, AgDzip1l, and AAms were also
transcribed at low levels in the head. The significance of
this observation remains unknown, but it is tempting to
speculate that their products may be involved in modulation of adult male physiology and behavior, such as
female seeking and mating. Finally, Ams was expressed at
very low levels in the head and thorax.
Comparison of orthologues from other mosquitoes
Using RT-PCR, we explored the expression patterns of all
An. gambiae orthologs in both sexes of Ae. aegypti and Cx.
quinquefasciatus pupae and adults. All orthologs were
expressed in males of both species, but only the mts gene
was apparently expressed in males exclusively (Figure 3,
Additional file 1). The other genes were expressed in Aedes
and Culex females at various levels, ranging from very low
(with strong male bias) to high (with sex-unbiased or
female-biased expression). The latter cases, concerning
the Ropn1l gene in Culex, the Dzip1l gene in Aedes, and the
Ams orthologs in both Aedes and Culex, indicate either
additional functions for these genes in females or different functions in these species altogether. Contrary to our
study a microarray-based comparison of gene expression
in Ae. aegypti adults showed no male bias in Ropn1l and
mts transcript levels [5]. This discrepancy probably results
from a lower sensitivity of microarrays as compared to RTPCR in detecting differential gene expression. Our observations of expression divergence between Anopheles and
culicine orthologs are not surprising in the light of Drosophila studies, which showed that male-biased genes are
particularly prone to shifts in expression patterns leading
to a gain, loss, increase, decrease, or reversal of sex-biased
expression even in closely related species [33]. Such
changes may be driven by sex-dependent natural selection, as suggested by significantly greater ratios of interspecific expression divergence to intraspecific expression
polymorphism among male-biased genes compared to
female-biased genes, or genes with sexually monomorphic expression patterns [34].

We searched the NCBI EST collection for mosquito
expressed sequence tags matching the identified genes to
provide additional evidence for their transcription (see
the Additional file 1 for details). The transcripts were very
poorly represented in the database. Only one out of
~153,000 An. gambiae ESTs unambiguously matched a
fragment of one gene, 18 out of ~300,000 Ae. aegypti ESTs
matched fragments of the three genes, and none of

region of AKAP3 [35]. AKAPs are a family of structurally
diverse proteins that in somatic cells bind through this a
helix domain to protein kinase A (PKA) after activation of
the cAMP signal transduction pathway [36,37]. Human
sperm-specific AKAPs are crucial to regulation of sperm
motility and their function apparently relies on the interaction with ROPN1L [35]. Remarkably, ROPN1L shares
high sequence similarity with the PKA region, known to
form the groove necessary for docking to the amphipathic
a helix of AKAPs [38].

gene were used as a control of equal sample loading in Ae.
aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus, respectively.
~205,000 ESTs from Cx. quinquefasciatus were found to
correspond to the identified genes.
Individual genes identified in the present study are
described in more detail below.
AgROPN1L
The AgRopn1l exhibits the highest degree of sequence and
structure conservation among all the identified genes. Its
encoded protein shares 65% similarity with Aedes and
Culex orthologs (Table 1, Additional file 2), and 47% similarity with the human putative ortholog, ropporin 1-like
protein (ROPN1L; known also as ASP). ROPN1L has been
shown to interact with the sperm-specific A-kinase
anchoring protein, AKAP3, via the amphipathic a helix

The AgRopn1l orthologs are widely distributed across the
animal kingdom. Apart from human they were identified
in other vertebrates, most insects, a sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, a blood-fluke Schistosoma japonicum,
and an organism as distant as the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. In addition, a protein homolog of ROPN1L
(called RSP11) was found within the radial spokes of the
axonemal complex in a unicellular flagellate alga
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. A recent study showed that
RSP11-deficient Chlamydomonas mutants display abnormal motility [39], which strongly suggests that the
ROPN1L homologs constitute a critical component of the
machinery controlling function of the flagella in a very
wide range of organisms. However, the low level of
AgRopn1l expression in the head implies an additional
function of the protein in mosquitoes. All ROPN1L
homologs are highly similar to each other and to PKA at
the N terminus, where perfectly conserved positions mark
residues apparently vital to the correct groove formation
and binding to AKAPs (Figure 4). A number of conserved
sites among the ROPN1L orthologs extending up to ~150
residues beyond the docking domain must also be important for the correct protein functioning (Additional file 2).
The insect ROPN1L orthologs are up to three times longer
than the orthologs from other organisms due to a single
highly variable insertion region. Its significance remains
unknown, because apart from the N-terminal AKAP-binding domain, insect proteins do not contain any recognizable motifs.
Surprisingly, no proteins similar to AgROPN1L were identified in the Drosophila melanogaster genome. Similarly, no
significant hits were returned from a TBLASTN search of
the 12 Drosophila genomes available in the NCBI's WGS
database. Although ROPN1L may have diverged in the
Drosophila lineage past detection by BLAST search, this scenario seems unlikely taking into account conservation of
the protein sequence in other animal groups. Alternatively, it could have been lost in the Drosophila ancestor,
which implies that the presumed mechanism of sperm
flagellum motility control in Drosophila may be different
than in other insects. Remarkably, no sequences homologous to AgRopn1l were identified in Caenorhabditis
genomes, but, unlike in Drosophila, sperm cells in nema-

todes are aflagellate, have amoeboid shape and move
using pseudopods [40]. Moreover, Caenorhabditis lacks
motile cilia [41], which, in other organisms, share elements of molecular motor machinery with flagella.
AgDzip1l
The AgDzip1l is relatively well conserved. At the amino
acid level, it shares 58% similarity with culicine sequences
and 46% similarity with its human putative ortholog DAZ
interacting protein 1-like protein (DZIP1L). DZIP1L
remains uncharacterized and its function is unknown, but
the Gene Ontology terms associated with its GenBank
record include: "nucleic acid binding", "protein binding",
"zinc ion binding", and "germ cell development". In addition, according to the UniGene EST Profile Viewer, the
Dzip1l gene is expressed in a number of tissues, including
testis. The DZIP1L shares 58% sequence similarity with
the human DAZ interacting protein 1 (DZIP1), which is
expressed in testis and co-localized with Deleted in
Azoospermia (DAZ) protein playing a pivotal role in the
male germ cell development [42].

The AgDZIP1L predicted protein contains a single C2H2
zinc finger domain. C2H2 zinc finger proteins comprise a
large family of regulatory proteins involved in binding
nucleic acids or proteins [43], and most of them contain
between 2 and 37 C2H2 domains. [44]. In those that possess a single domain, high affinity DNA binding is
achieved by a zinc finger complemented by short stretches
of highly basic amino acids flanking the domain [45,46].
In AgDZIP1L, a highly basic sequence region found at the
N-terminal flank of the domain (Additional file 2) is consistent with a putative AgDZIP1L involvement in nucleic
acid binding, which is further supported by the WoLF

PSORT analysis suggesting localization of the protein to
the nucleus.
Ams
Ams appears to be an extremely rapidly evolving gene in
Anopheles. Because of its divergence, the TBLASTN search
failed to identify its homologs even in other mosquitoes.
Since such a search strategy may not be sensitive enough
to detect highly diverged sequences, we used microsynteny information in an attempt to identify the Ams
orthologs in culicines. Tango1 (Transport and Golgi organization 1) and xdh genes, which flank the Ams in An. gambiae, have conserved linkage in the culicinegenomes. The
sequences spanning between Tango1 and xdh in Aedes and
Culex share a short similarity region bearing a protein coding capacity, with ORFs in the same orientation as the A.
gambiae Ams relative to the flanking genes. Using RT-PCR
and species-specific primers encompassing the most conserved culicine ORFs we confirmed that this hypothetical
gene is expressed (in a female-biased pattern) in both
Aedes and Culex (Figure 3). Two transcripts, differing in
size due to an intron splicing or retention, were strongly
expressed in the Ae. aegypti females, while in males strong
expression corresponded to a transcript with an intron
spliced out. In Cx. quinquefasciatus a single transcript with
an intron retained was expressed in a female-biased fashion. In both Aedes and Culex intron retention leads to a
transcript that may encode a truncated, but functional,
putative protein. It is also possible that intron retention is
a result of a faulty splicing event, and such a transcript,
with a premature termination codon (PTC), is destined to
degradation via the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay
(NMD) pathway [47]. However, the latter scenario seems
implausible for Culex, in which the only identified tran-

script form contains a potential PTC. The culicine
sequences are highly similar to each other at the amino
acid level, but only remotely similar to the Ams gene
(71%/90% identity/similarity, and 14%/31% identity/
similarity, respectively; note, that the comparisons are
based on a sequence fragment highly conserved in
culicines, for which expression in Aedes and Culex could
be experimentally confirmed; the complete culicine gene
models were not created; see Additional file 2), leaving a
large degree of uncertainty as to the homology between
Ams and the putative culicine genes. However, because
there is no other contradictory evidence, we regard these
genes as putative orthologs.
The An. gambiae AMS protein is weakly basic (theoretical
pI of 8.66). According to the TRESPASSER program analysis, it contains a leucine zipper motif (Leu-X6-Leu-X6Leu-X6-Leu), which is found in a-helical segments. Leucine side chains from such segments can interact with
other a-helices to form coiled coils. Existence of a coiled
coil domain encompassing the leucine zipper motif is
indeed predicted in the AMS protein by the COILS program from the PredictProtein package. Coiled coil proteins exhibit a wide range of functions, including cellular
motility, signal transduction and modulation of transcription [48]. It should be noted, however, that because leucine is the most frequent amino acid and the motif is very
simple, such a pattern may have arisen in the AMS protein
by chance [49]. No leucine zipper motifs have been found
in the culicine orthologs, but their large divergence from
the An. gambiae Ams in both sequence and expression pattern implies that the proteins in culicines have attained
different structure and function.
mts
Sequences homologous to mts could be identified only in
mosquitoes. The mts transcript encodes a protein that contains no identifiable motifs that would allow us to infer its
function. However, the highly basic character of MTS (theoretical pI of 10.4) provides a hint about its potential
involvement in chromatin condensation. Detection of mts
transcription in spermatids (Figure 2C) further strengthens this supposition. In mammalian spermiogenesis a set
of highly basic proteins is involved in chromatin restructuring, associated with a displacement of histones by transition proteins, which are subsequently replaced by
protamines [50]. In effect, chromatin becomes transcriptionally silent and tightly packaged into a sperm nucleus,
which is reduced in volume more than 20 times [51]. During maturation of the Drosophila sperm, the volume of the
nucleus is reduced over 200-fold [52], apparently via similar mechanisms as those operating in mammals. Chromatin condensation in Drosophila is also associated with
the removal of histones and accumulation of protamines.
A temporal gap exists between the presence of histones

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/300

and protamines and during that time a highly basic protein Tpl94D, presumably a functional homologue of mammalian transition proteins, is transiently expressed in the
nuclei [53]. There are several other highly basic Drosophila
proteins expressed in testes and likely to be involved in
sperm maturation, which may functionally correspond to
MTS, however, their specific functions remain unknown
[53,54].
AAms
The RT-PCR experiments showed that the AAms gene
encodes two transcripts expressed in testis (Figure 1). One
transcript consists of two exons coding for a 1188-residue
protein. The second transcript, characterized by a shorter
ORF generated by a transcript-specific intron splicing,
may encode a truncated protein form (cf. Additional file
1). Alternatively, it may represent a misspliced transcript
that bears a premature termination codon and, as such, is
subject to degradation by NMD.

Sequences homologous to AAms were identified only in
mosquitoes, in which they exhibit substantial variability
in length and sequence (Table 1 and Additional file 2).
The predicted AAMS protein orthologs lack any clearly
defined conserved domains that would suggest their function or subcellular localization. The TopPred program
predicted two transmembrane domains in the long version of the protein and one domain in its putative truncated form in Anopheles, two domains in its Culex
ortholog, and between one and three domains in the
Aedes protein, however, no such domains were identified
in any of these proteins by the TMHMM program. The
protein is acidic (theoretical pI of 4.94) and according to
secondary structure and globularity prediction programs
from PredictProtein server, half of its length forms loops
interspersed among helices and strands, and its sequence
folds into a compact structure.

Conclusion
Our study sheds light on the virtually uncharacterized
developmental processes in male mosquitoes. The strategy applied allowed us to identify five genes expressed in
testes during late phases of spermatogenesis. The high
complexity of testis function dictates that the number of
genes involved must be much larger. In D. melanogaster
there are over 1700 genes thought to be testis-specific [7].
Only about a 1000 of those have homologs detectable in
An. gambiae (unpublished). Because the diversity of testis
transcripts in mosquitoes is expected to be comparable to
that in Drosophila, we predict that in addition to these conserved genes (it should be noted that some mosquito
homologs may not share testis-specific expression patterns observed in D. melanogaster), many rapidly evolving
genes, not detectable by a simple homology search, are
expressed in mosquito testes. Further analysis of the SSH

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:300

products using a more elaborate differential screening
protocol is likely to provide more male-specifically
expressed genes in An. gambiae. Likewise, further studies
targeting transcripts from dissected testes are expected to
give more information about testis-specific expression.
Microarray analysis seems an attractive alternative to
cDNA subtraction, however, the results in this method
rely exclusively on the quality of microarray probes. It is
likely that a considerable percentage of fast evolving genes
expressed in Anopheles testes still awaits discovery (four
out of five genes identified in the current study remain
unannotated in the most recent An. gambiae genome
release, which may be indicative of a problem). By definition, probes corresponding to such genes are absent from
gene-based microarrays, therefore, their expression would
remain undetected. This study demonstrates that the existing gene annotations can be further improved by the careful comparative analysis of the available mosquito
genomes. Yet, because of a deep phylogenetic divergence
reaching 145–200 million years [55], detection of rapidly
evolving genes or correct delineation of their coding
regions constitutes a major challenge in sequence comparisons between Anopheles and culicines. Consequently, further refinement of the Anopheles gambiae genome
annotation may require genome sequences of additional
Anopheles species and, still, supporting experimental evidence seems unavoidable.
The discovery of testis-expressed orphan genes opens new
prospects for the development of innovative mosquito
control methods. The proteins encoded by the orphans
are unique in their potential as mosquito-specific targets
of sterilizing chemicals. Such sterilizing insecticides could
be a very useful alternative to irradiation in the production of sterile males for their subsequent release in the
sterile insect technique approach to control. Furthermore,
following proper testing, these chemosterilants could
potentially be applied for direct control of wild mosquito
populations and become an important component of an
integrated management program for An. gambiae.

Methods
Insects
Anopheles gambiae G3 and Kisumu, Aedes aegypti Liverpool
and Culex quinquefasciatus Thai laboratory strains were
used in the experiments. Mosquitoes were reared according to established procedures [56-58].
RNA isolation
RNA was extracted from all postembryonic developmental stages and selected male tissues of Anopheles gambiae, as
well as from the Culex quinquefasciatus pupae and adults,
and Aedes aegypti adults. A. gambiae adult males were dissected in 1 × PBS (Ambion). Heads, thoraces and abdomens (with undissected internal organs) were

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/300

homogenized in TRI reagent (Sigma) and stored at -80°C
until RNA extraction, whereas dissected midguts, Malpighian tubules, testes and accessory glands were stored in
RNA later (Ambion) at -20°C. Prior to RNA extraction, larvae and pupae were washed twice in DEPC-treated water
and larvae sexed by PCR using Y chromosome-specific
primers [59]. Total RNA from developmental stages and
body sections was extracted according to [60], with minor
modifications. Following extraction, the samples were
treated with TURBO DNase (Ambion) and the enzyme
was removed by addition of DNase Inactivation Reagent
(Ambion). The RNA solution was quantitated using ND1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies), and
stored at -80°C until needed. Total RNA from dissected
tissues was extracted using RiboPure Kit (Ambion) according to manufacturer's specifications.
cDNA subtraction
Total RNA was extracted from 100 whole female pupae
and from distal segments of the abdomens (containing
reproductive organs) of 200 male pupae using TRI reagent
(Sigma) according to manufacturer's recommendations.
An Oligotex mRNA Kit (Qiagen) was used to isolate poly
A+ mRNA, from which cDNA was synthesized. Based on
the assumption that the reproductive organ-specific transcripts may be relatively rare in the extracted mRNA population, the male cDNA was amplified using a SMART
PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech). Liquid hybridization
was performed using 25 ng of the male and 1 mg of the
female double stranded cDNA. Sequences expressed specifically/preferentially in males were enriched using a
PCR-Select cDNA Subtraction Kit (Clontech) according to
the manufacturer's protocols. The resulting cDNA subtraction products were run on an agarose gel. Detectable fragments were excised from the gel and reamplified by PCR
using Nested Primer 1 and Nested Primer 2R included in
the subtraction kit. The resulting PCR products were gel
purified using QIAquick Gel Purification kit (Qiagen),
ligated into pGEM-T Easy plasmid (Promega), and after
electroporation, amplified in E. coli ElectroMAX DH10B
cells (Invitrogen). Cloned templates were PCR amplified
and sequenced using ABI BigDye terminator chemistry
(PE Applied Biosystems) on an ABI 3130xl Genetic Analyzer.
RT-PCR
The expression patterns of each subtraction product were
tested in RT-PCR reactions using product-specific primers.
SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum
Taq (Invitrogen) kit was used in all experiments. The reactions were performed in MyCycler thermal cycler (BioRad) using 30 or 50 ng of total RNA and gene-specific
primer pairs, with the following thermal conditions: 15
min of first strand cDNA synthesis at 50–60°C, followed
by 2 min at 94°C, then 28–32 cycles of 94°C for 15 sec,

Page 10 of 13

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:300

54–60°C for 30 sec, and 68°C for 40–120 sec, with the
final extension at 68°C for 5 min. Fragments of the following mRNAs, with their respective primers in parentheses, were amplified to serve as an internal control of equal
sample loading: the ribosomal S7 gene for An. gambiae
(5'-TGCTGCAAACTTCGGCTAT-3' and 5'-CGCTATGGTGTTCGGTTCC-3') and Culex quinquefasciatus (5'-AGATGAACTCGGACCTGAAG-3'
and
5'-TGCTGG
TTCTTGTCCAGATG-3'), and actin-1 for Ae. aegypti (5'-CT
GGAGAAGTCTTATGAACTTCCTGATGGTC-3' and 5'GAATAGTATCTTCCGATGGGGATGTTCGTTAG-3').
Amplification of cDNA ends
Amplification of 5'- and 3'- ends of the genes was performed with the GeneRacer kit (Invitrogen). Total RNA (2
mg) from abdomens of newly emerged adult males was
dephosphorylated with calf intestinal phosphatase, followed by removal of the 5' mRNA cap structure using
tobacco acid pyrophosphatase, which leaves a 5' phosphate only in full length mRNAs. Then, the GeneRacer
RNA Oligo was ligated to the 5'ends of the mRNAs using
T4 RNA ligase. The ligated mRNA was reverse transcribed
using GeneRacer Oligo dT Primer and Superscript III
reverse transcriptase. Thus obtained first strand cDNA was
used to amplify the 5' end of each gene using a reverse
gene-specific primer and the GeneRacer 5' Primer. PCR
reactions contained 1 ml of the first strand cDNA reaction
mixture with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min,
followed by 5 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec and 72°C for 3
min, then by 5 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec and 70°C for 3
min, then by 25 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 68°C for 30 sec,
and 72°C for 3 min, followed by a final elongation step at
72°C for 10 min. The resulting products were subjected to
a second round of PCR using the GeneRacer 5' Nested
Primer and reverse gene-specific nested primers. Nested
PCR contained 1 ml of the initial PCR reaction mixture as
a template and was performed with an initial 94°C for 2
min, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 58–62°C
for 30 sec, and 72°C for 3 min, with a final elongation
step at 72°C for 10 min. The 3'-ends of the genes were
recovered using gene-specific primers and the GeneRacer
Oligo dT Primer, and the thermal conditions as given
above for nested PCR (but the annealing temperature
being 52–60°C). The PCR products containing both 5'
and 3' ends were gel purified and cloned. Multiple clones
from each PCR were sequenced as described above.
Sequence analysis
Full length sequences of An. gambiae genes were assembled from multiple clones and verified by visual inspection of electropherograms using Sequencher v. 4.1 (Gene
Codes Corp). Similarity searches against NCBI's and VectorBase databases were performed using BLAST programs
[61]. Orthologs in Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus
genomes were designated based on the reciprocal best hits

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/300

in TBLASTN searches and on microsynteny (co-linearity
and same orientation of flanking genes) information.
Coding regions in culicines were identified using comparisons to the An. gambiae sequences and further validated
using RT-PCR and sequencing of the amplified products;
the validation was crucial for the correct delineation of the
intron-exon boundaries. In more distantly related organisms no synteny evidence could be found and in such
cases putative orthologs were identified based on the
reciprocal best hit criterion. Homologs of D. melanogaster
testis-specific genes were identified based on the best hits
in TBLASTN searches of An. gambiae genome. The pattern
discovery tool from the RSAT program [62] was used to
search for 6–8 bp long putative testis-specific cis-regulatory motifs overrepresented in the upstream regions of the
An. gambiae genes identified in this study. Multiple
sequence alignments were performed using ClustalX [63].
Computation of the theoretical isoelectric point (pI) and
the molecular weight was performed using the ExPaSy
tool http://www.expasy.ch/tools/pi_tool.html. Pfam
http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/, Prosite http://
ca.expasy.org/cgi-bin/scanprosite and SMART http://
smart.embl-heidelberg.de/ databases were searched to
identify conserved domains in the predicted protein products. PredictProtein http://www.predictprotein.org/ was
used for prediction of various aspects of protein structure
and function. Searches for transmembrane helices were
additionally conducted using Top-Pred http://bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/interfaces/toppred.html
and
TMHMM http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/. SignalP http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ and WoLF
PSORT http://wolfpsort.org/ were used to characterize a
potential for secretion and a likely subcellular localization
of the proteins. Search for leucine zipper motifs was performed using TRESPASSER http://comp.chem.nottingham.ac.uk/trespasser/.
Whole-mount in situ hybridization
A 354 bp fragment of Ams was amplified using primers
cDNA3F
(5'-TGGAACAGTTCAACAATGGG-3')
and
cDNA3R (5'-GGTCGATGATTTCCCGATTC-3'), and a 519
bp fragment of mts was amplified using primers
cDNAsub4F (5'-ACCTTTCCGTTCCTCTTCAT-3') and
cDNAsub4R (5'-ACTAAGCACAAGCAAAGCCC-3'). The
PCR products were ligated into the vector plasmid pGEMT easy (Promega) and the orientation of the cloned inserts
was verified by sequencing. The plasmids were linearized
by complete digestion with either SpeI or NcoI to generate
templates for sense and antisense probes. Linearized plasmids were used for in vitro transcription with T7 or SP6
RNA polymerase to create sense and antisense DIGlabeled probes according to [64]. Testes and accessory
glands of adult males < 12 h posteclosion were dissected
in PBS and processed for hybridization following [64].
Probe was detected in a color reaction induced by alkaline

phosphatase conjugated to anti-DIG antibody. The activity of endogenous alkaline phosphatases was not eliminated prior to probe detection, which resulted in the
induction of a low level of background color reaction.
After signal detection samples were washed for 5 min in
PBT (PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) to stop the staining reaction,
then stored overnight in 70% glycerol and mounted the
next day on slides.
