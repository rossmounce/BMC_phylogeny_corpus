Abstract
Background: Olfactory Receptors (ORs) form the largest multigene family in vertebrates. Their
evolution and their expansion in the vertebrate genomes was the subject of many studies. In this
paper we apply a motif-based approach to this problem in order to uncover evolutionary
characteristics.
Results: We extract deterministic motifs from ORs belonging to ten species using the MEX (Motif
Extraction) algorithm, thus defining Common Peptides (CPs) characteristic to ORs. We identify
species-specific CPs and show that their relative abundance is high only in fish and frog, suggesting
relevance to water-soluble odorants. We estimate the origins of CPs according to the tree of life
and track the gains and losses of CPs through evolution. We identify major CP gain in tetrapods
and major losses in reptiles. Although the number of human ORs is less than half of the number of
ORs in other mammals, the fraction of lost CPs is only 11%.
By examining the positions of CPs along the OR sequence, we find two regions that expanded only
in tetrapods. Using CPs we are able to establish remote homology relations between ORs and nonOR GPCRs.
Selecting CPs according to their evolutionary age, we bicluster ORs and CPs for each species.
Clean biclustering emerges when using relatively novel CPs. Evolutionary age is used to track the
history of CP acquisition in the collection of mammalian OR families within HORDE (Human
Olfactory Receptor Data Explorer).
Conclusion: The CP method provides a novel perspective that reveals interesting traits in the
evolution of olfactory receptors. It is consistent with previous knowledge, and provides finer
details. Using available phylogenetic trees, evolution can be rephrased in terms of CP origins.

Background
Odor recognition in vertebrates is mediated by a large
superfamily of olfactory receptor (OR) genes, G-protein
coupled receptors (GPCRs) with seven trans-membrane

domains [1,2]. Whole genome studies discovered hundreds of intact ORs in the vertebrate genome, ranging in
size from ~100 in fishes to ~1000 in mouse [3-5] and [6].

A recent study of OR evolutionary dynamics indicated the
existence of nine ancestral genes common to fish and
tetrapods, of which only two are found in birds and mammals. Specifically one of these, known as Class II, has
expanded enormously in mammals [6]. Several studies
have applied computational sequence analysis and phylogeny methods to study the evolution of the OR repertoire in vertebrates [6,7]. One of these studies [8] used
motifs to analyze human and mouse OR repertoires,
focusing on classification of the motifs into classes and
classification of the ORs using these motifs as features.
We adopt a different motif-based approach that extracts
deterministic motifs, i.e. peptides, and explores their
appearance along OR evolution. We apply the motif
extraction algorithm MEX [9], the efficacy of which has
been previously demonstrated in the study of enzymes
[10], to 4027 OR sequences of 10 vertebrates. A short
explanation of MEX is also provided in the Methods section. The union of all motifs leads to a list of 2717 MEXderived peptides, to be referred to as Common Peptides
(CPs). These motifs can be mapped onto specific locations on the seven trans-membrane domains.
Following CP occurrences on ORs of different species we
can trace the development of these domains with evolution. Using the Tree of Life, we perform an ancestral reconstruction of CPs and determine their evolutionary ages.
For each species we perform biclustering of the matrix of
CP occurrences on ORs. Choosing CP groups according to
their evolutionary age we get different clustering patterns.

The use of CPs for studying OR sequences enables us to
explore different aspects regarding OR evolution than
those uncovered by phylogenetic methods. It also enables
us to uncover some fine details of OR groups that were
previously studied using regular-expression motifs, due to
the deterministic nature of our motifs (see also [11]).

Results
CP mapping on the Tree of Life
We used 4027 OR sequences representing the complete
intact OR repertoires in 10 vertebrates (Table 1). We
extracted a list of CPs by applying MEX to OR sequences
of each species individually, followed by a unification
procedure to remove redundancy (see Methods for a
detailed description).

All CPs are tested for their occurrence on all ORs, irrespective of which species lead to their extraction. We define
species-specific CPs as CPs observed only in one species.
On average an OR is matched by 48 CPs, covering 147
amino acids on its sequence. Some CPs partially overlap
with one another. The total number of CPs found in
sequences of one species (column 3 in Table 1) is highly
correlated (Pearson correlation = 0.9) with the number of
ORs per species (column 2 in Table 1).
The percentage of species-specific CPs is particularly high
in fish and frog (although less than 6% of the pufferfish
CPs are pufferfish-specific, the percentage of fish-specific,
including both fish, is 18%). The percentage of speciesspecific CPs drops significantly to an average of 2% in

other species, with human having the smallest amount of
species-specific CPs. This finding might be attributed to
the difference between aquatic environment, characteristic of fish and the amphibian frog X. tropicalis that remains
aquatic also in its adult life (see [12] and [13]), and terrestrial environments characteristic of the other species: presumably CPs were lost – together with their ORs (groups
δ, ε, ζ and η in [6])- in terrestrial species that have developed later.
We evaluate the emergence and loss of CPs on a commonly accepted tree of life representation (figure 1), using
the parsimony method (see details on the chosen method
and other tested ancestral reconstruction methods in the
Methods section).
We identify "novel CPs" as those that exist in the current
ancestor/species but did not exist in previous ancestors,
and "lost CPs" as those that do not exist in the current
ancestor/species but did exist in the previous ancestor.
CPs that date back to previous ancestors are referred to as
"conserved CPs".
The analysis detects one major addition of novel CPs in
the ancestor of tetrapods, A2. Judging by [14] the branch
length between A1 and A3 is about the same as that
between A3 to A6. 47% of the CPs at A6 are novel with
regard to A3. This should be compared with the fact that
75% of CPs at A3 are novel with regard to A1. We thus
may conclude that the main expansion of OR CPs has
taken place at, or before, A3.
Reptiles have suffered major losses of CPs, a trend that
was further increased in chicken. Another major loss
occurred in pufferfish.
Interestingly, while humans lost more than half of their
ORs relative to other mammals, they lost only 11% of the
CPs existing in A6. This suggests that some redundancy in
mammalian ORs has been removed by OR pseudogenization in human. This result is surprising considering the
fact that the human intact OR repertoire contains much
less subfamilies relative to other mammals (according to
HORDE classification system [15]). For example, there are
242 and 227 subfamilies in mouse and dog respectively,
but only 175 subfamilies in human. Investigating subfamilies of mouse and dog ORs that are not matched by
human subfamilies, we nonetheless find many of their
CPs (68% of mouse CPs and 35% of dog CPs) elsewhere
in. other human subfamilies. In other words, according to
the CP perspective the similarity between human and
mouse or dog is larger than observed by the sequence similarity which is the basis of the subfamily classifications.
[16] hypothesize that the reduced sense of smell in
human could correlate with the loss of functional genes.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/9/91

The high co-occurrences of CPs in functional human,
mouse and dog genes hints, however, that the reduction
of the human OR repertoire may not necessarily cause loss
of functionality.
CPs that make a difference
The CP method extracts CPs that bear statistical significance. It is reasonable to assume that some of them also
have biological significance. We first looked for CPs that
differentiate between water-dwelling species (i.e. pufferfish, zebrafish and possibly frog) and purely terrestrial
species. We find 10 CPs that exist in fish (one of them
occurs also in frog) but not in any other land-dwelling
species. Similarly, we find 44 CPs which are terrestrial specific (none of them exist in frog). Of special interest are
CPs that reside in the outer region of the membrane
(extracellular loops and the external half of the transmembrane domains). Such CPs might participate in ligand
binding. Table 2 lists the CPs residing only in water-dwelling species. CPs that potentially play part in ligand binding are marked. Of particular interest is the CP "RLPLCG",
which resides on the extracellular loop 2 and contains a
Cysteine, possibly crosslinking with another Cysteine on
the ORs.

Table 3 lists the CPs residing only in terrestrial species.
CPs that potentially play part in ligand binding are
marked. More than 2/3 of these CPs occur in ORs that
belong predominantly (more than 40% of the total OR
occurrences) to one HORDE family.
GPCR remote homologies
ORs are part of a larger protein superfamily of G-Protein
Coupled Receptors (GPCRs). We searched 967 chicken,
human and mouse non-OR GPCRs taken from [17] and
[18] and found 526 of the OR CPs to appear in this dataset
(figure 2). The number of CP occurrences (hits) on an OR
is easily distinguishable from other GPCRs. The number
of CP hits on non-OR GPCRs exceeds that of a random
model, from which one expects to observe at most one or
two CP hits. Our observation of up to 6 CP hits for some
non-OR GPCRs indicates an ancestral relation between
ORs and some non-OR GPCRs, i.e. remote homology (see
histograms S6–S9 in Additional file 1] and explanation of
the random model in the Methods section).

Figures S1 and S2 are histograms of the same kind for
chicken and mouse respectively.
In figures S3–S5 we study the loci of OR CPs on non-OR
GPCRs in chicken and mammals respectively. Sharp peaks
in mammals correspond to known motifs [19]. No sharp
peaks are observed in chicken.

CPs existing in A8.

Locations of CPs on the OR sequence
We investigate the locations of the CPs along the 7 transmembrane (TM) domains. The resulting histograms are
compared with conservation loci of single amino-acids
[20]. Locations are determined relative to a highly curated
multiple alignment of human and mouse ORs. The histogram in figure 3 displays the relative coverage by CPs of
each position along the OR chain (see Methods section
3.4 for a description of normalization of positions
between ORs). Highly conserved positions of aminoacids, as deduced by [20] from mouse and dog data, are
indicated by red coloring of the histogram on 65 positions.

Figure 4 shows the CP position coverage for four species.
Figures displaying all CP positions for these three species,
all other species, assessed ancestor CPs, novel and lost
CPs, are provided in (figures S10–S15) [see Additional file
1].
Figure 4 indicates four regions which are highly populated
with CPs along all vertebrate evolution. These regions are
marked using a threshold drawn at 60% sequence population in zebrafish, displayed in figure 4B. All four regions
reside in the interface between the transmembrane
domains and the intracellular regions (IL1–3 and the Cterminal). These regions may be connected to structural
constraints in the interface that binds the G-proteins. Fig-

ures displaying OR coverage by position for all other species ranging from frog to human look very similar (figures
S10, S11 [see Additional file 1]). We observe that CPs
within some regions have developed much higher coverage only in tetrapods. These regions are marked in figure
4D. They are: the end of the N-terminal, the interface
between extracellular loop 1 (EL1) and TM1 and TM2 and
the middle of extracellular loop 2 (EL2). Most of the
newly emerged regions are facing the extracellular side of
the membrane. This imposes structural constraints on the
regions connected to odorant binding and might be specific to airborne odorants.
CP-space reveals internal clusters
Using biclustering, we obtain simultaneous co-occurrences of ORs and CPs for each species. This provides a
powerful visualization and allows the study of evolutionary trends across species. Details of the biclustering algo-

We perform the analysis using different sets of CPs characterized by their evolutionary ages.
First, we apply the procedure to zebrafish ORs, represented either by the conserved CPs, i.e. CPs shared with
tetrapods (A1) or by zebrafish novel CPs (see figure 1 for
reference). There are only nine CPs novel to A8 (the common ancestor of zebrafish and pufferfish) hence they are
not used in the clustering analysis. The results are displayed in figure 5. We identify an interesting pattern in
this figure. Zebrafish novel CPs form almost disjoint
biclusters, while OR clusters based on conserved CPs (CPs
originating high in the tree) tend to share CPs (figure. 5A).
Conserved CPs cover almost all ORs (seven ORs did not
pass the threshold of minimal CP number specified in the
Methods section). Novel CPs cover only half of the ORs.
We identify ten clusters in zebrafish using ancestral (A1)
CPs and six using zebrafish-novel CPs. Each of the latter
six clusters matches one of the former clusters. The
detailed cluster assignments are displayed in the supplementary material [see Additional file 1].
Novel CPs emerge from speciation and duplication events
occurring after the split of fish from A1. We find 10 ORs
that do not have any novel CPs in zebrafish and fish common ancestor (A8). This can serve as a first estimate of the
number of ORs that existed in A1. They reside in the OR
clusters indicated by red circles in Figure. 5A.
Classification of zebrafish ORs into groups has been studied by [6] and [21]. Both found eight groups with different
OR membership (four groups of [6] and one of [21] contain only one OR each). Biclusters of novel CPs (Figure.
5B) map perfectly to some groups (groups δ, ζ and η of
[6]), where some groups are further split to reveal finer
details (e.g. groups δ and ζ of [6] and group E of [21] are
split into two biclusters). The 10 ORs which contain no
novel CPs have members only from groups δ, θ and κ of
[6]. For mapping between our clusters, and the groups of
[6] and [21], see additional files 2, 3 and 4.
The biclustering algorithm allows us also to differentiate
between the different zebrafish clusters. The assumption
is that OR clusters which relate to recent ancestry might
also bear functional similarity. While some of the CPs that
differentiate between the OR clusters are conserved remnants of duplication events, other CPs represent segments
of these ORs that might contribute to a common functionality of the OR cluster. A table of the CPs of each cluster is provided [see Additional file 5].

Pufferfish has few novel CPs. Biclusters formed using CPs
belonging to A1 look similar to the ones displayed in Figure 5A. The biclustering of pufferfish appears in figure S16
[see Additional file 1].
Figure 6 displays biclustering results of frog. Three sets of
CPs are being used, those novel to A1, novel to the tetrapods' ancestor (A2) and novel to frog. Ancestral CPs form
noisy clusters, while CPs novel to frog form almost disjoint clusters, similar to the zebrafish biclusters. As in
zebrafish, the number of ORs covered by CPs drops with
the age of the CP (i.e. the node in the ToL where it first
appears). We identify nine clusters using CPs novel to
frog. They map almost perfectly to clusters identified
using either novel CPs of A1 or A2 [see Additional file 3].
Unlike zebrafish clusters, not all the A1 and A2 conserved
CPs form identifiable biclusters. This suggests that they
have been subjected to a higher mutation rate than
observed in zebrafish, which may relate to the appearance
of class II ORs in frog [22]. The clusters in figure 6c relate
to the groups γ and δ of [6], [see Additional file 4].
Chicken and lizard have too few novel A3 and A7 CPs, to
construct biclusters. The novel CPs of chicken form one
big cluster, while novel CPs of lizard form small disjoint
clusters. Novel CPs to A1 and A2 also show difference
between chicken and lizard. While the former reveals a
robust big cluster, the latter show no clusters at all. This
implies large number of recent duplications in chicken.
The biclustering of chicken and lizard appear in figures
S17–S18 [see Additional file 1].
Biclusters in mammals are displayed in figures S19–S23
[see Additional file 1]. Biclusters are significant for CPs
novel to A3–A6. They can be mapped to class I (fish-like)
and class II (mammals-like) ORs, and to families of the
Human Olfactory Receptor Data Explorer (HORDE). The
mapping appears in Additional files 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and
12.
Novel CPs and mammalian families
Figure 7 shows the correspondence between mammalian
CPs and the classification of the OR superfamily into families, using the HORDE classification system [15]. Class II
(families 1–13) ORs contain predominantly CPs of A2. In
contrast, class I (families 51, 52 and 56) ORs have equal
distribution of novel CPs from A1 and A2. We also
observe that family 3 almost ceased to evolve after A2 and
families 9 and 11 stopped evolving after A3.

importance [23] and are expected to play structural and
functional roles in olfactory receptors. Having extracted
such CPs from ten species, we use evolutionary constraints to further employ the extracted CPs in making
sense of the complex relationships of ORs of different species with one another.
The evolutionary perspective is obtained by applying the
parsimony principle to a tree-of-life accommodating the
studied species. It allows us to construct an ancestral
phyletic pattern of the presence or absence of CPs in internal nodes of the tree. Using this construction, we show
that the number of species-specific CPs is relatively high
in fish and frog, but remains fixed in terrestrial species.
The species-specific CPs in the aquatic species might be
related to ORs detecting water-soluble odorants. We
observe a major emergence of CPs in the ancestor of tetrapods and major losses of CPs in pufferfish and in chicken.
A surprising result stemming from this mapping is that
although humans lost half of the intact mammalian ORs,
they lost only 11% of the conserved CPs, suggesting a controlled process of loss of redundant ORs. In other words,
the potential odorant recognition of humans may have
suffered only a minor damage by the severe diminution of
their OR repertoire.
CPs that differentiate between water-dwelling species and
terrestrial species have potential biological significance
and are candidates for further biochemical studies.
We show that some of the OR-extracted CPs exist in the
general GPCR population, demonstrating the ancient origin of ORs and several other GPCRs.
The fact that the OR history stretches back to fish was
made by [6] who claimed that 85%–90% of frog, chicken,
mouse and human OR repertoires was constructed from
duplication of a single fish OR of group γ, Dr3OR5.4. One
or more of these 35 fish group γ CPs are also observed in
98% of the tetrapod ORs. This is larger than the coverage
observed for CPs in any other fish ORs. These 35 CPs are
also almost exclusively located in the five most conserved
positions in figure 3 (boundary between IL1 and TM2,
boundary between IL2 and TM3, middle of EL2, boundary
between IL3 and TM6 and TM7). We point out, however,
that major changes have occurred in other nodes of evolutionary history. By studying loci of CPs we identify two
regions that show high CP coverage starting from tetrapods: the N-terminal and the middle of the second extracellular loop. This might imply that these regions are
important for the adaptation of ORs to airborne odorants.

Discussion and conclusion
We use CPs extracted by MEX (Motif Extraction algorithm) to study evolutionary processes in olfactory receptors. Such conserved CPs are known to have biological

Gene multiplication events are most naturally exhibited
by the existence of clusters of ORs. Using the evolutionary
separation into novel and conserved CPs, we are able to

demonstrate clean OR clusters. This is done by applying a
biclustering algorithm to matrices associating CPs with
ORs within species: clean clusters emerge when novel CPs
are being employed. Results vary with increasing evolutionary age of the species in question. Our biclustering
results of the species studied by [6,21] (zebrafish, frog and
chicken) generally support their phylogenetic models, but
provide finer OR grouping and a cleaner selection of the
responsible ancestor (where CP formation has occurred).
Finally, we are able to use the CP analysis to provide
developmental details of OR families of the Human
Olfactory Receptor Data Explorer (HORDE).

Methods
Data
For the described study we selected a set of 4027 intact
olfactory receptors (ORs) from ten vertebrate species
including pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes), zebrafish (Danio
rerio), frog (Xenopus tropicalis), chicken (Gallus gallus), lizard (Anolis carolinensis), platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus), opossum (Monodelphis domestica), dog (Canis
familiaris), mouse (Mus musculus) and human (Homo sapiens).

All mammalian, chicken and lizard OR sequences are
available at the HORDE [15]. OR sequences of fish and
frog were taken from the study of [6]. Lizard and Platypus
ORs appear in [24]. The number of ORs for each species is
listed in Table 1.
967 chicken, human and mouse non-OR GPCRs were
taken from [17] and [18].
MEX algorithm
MEX is a motif extraction algorithm introduced by [9] as
part of a method for grammar induction from texts and
was later used on proteins [10]. Given a set of proteins,
they are represented as different paths over a graph that
consists of 20 vertices, corresponding to the 'alphabet' of
20 amino-acids. MEX proceeds by looking for convergence of many paths onto strings of amino-acids, and the
subsequent divergence from such strings. The latter are
defined as motifs if both convergence and divergence
obey some statistical conditions. These conditions are
imposed on context-dependent variable-order Markov
chains that are constructed out of the data-paths. The
algorithm has two parameters, η and α, specifying the

CP coverage of positions along the OR sequence
CP coverage of positions along the OR sequence. Positions start from the N-terminal (N), through Transmembrane
domains 1–7 (T1–T7), Intracellular loops (I1–I3) and extracellular loops (E1–E3) and end in the C-terminal (C). 65 known

amount of convergence/divergence and its statistical significance given the number of paths involved in the process. More information can be found on the website [25].
In the present analysis we ran MEX on the proteins of each
species separately, using the parameter values η = 0.9 and
α = 0.01. We restricted ourselves to peptides of length 5
amino-acids or more and appearing in at least 4 ORs.
These peptides were merged into one list, where duplicates and peptides containing other peptides were
removed. The resulting non-redundant list contains 2717
Common Peptides (CPs). Each of the CPs was then
searched on the ORs of all species. CPs that appear only in
the ORs of one of the studied species are defined to be species-specific.
Fitting CPs to the tree of life and phylogenetic analysis
We used the tree of life web project, available at [26] to
construct the relationships between the species. The relations between the species is consistent with the tree of life
of [14]. Dog, Mouse and Human were put under one com-

mon ancestor according to the tree of life web project,
although there are other possible ancestral orders based
on different set of genes (see also[27,28]-[29]). Trying
other arrangements for Dog, Mouse and Human did not
alter the derived conclusions. The assessment of CP origins uses the Wagner parsimony, as implemented by the
Phylogeny Inference Package computer programs
PHYLIP. Similar results are also obtained by Dollo parsimony.
Since some CPs differ by only one amino acid from others, we have also checked whether loss and gain of a CP on
any internal node corresponds to a mutation of a single
amino-acid (interpreted as a loss of the CP) into another
amino-acid (interpreted as a gain of a CP). We have found
that the number of such events is negligible (1 such event
in an ancestral node on average and 7 on average in the
species, occurring mainly in chicken and lizard).
Following Parsimony estimation, each internal node A1–
A8, and each species, has a list of CPs associated with it.

CP coverage of positions along the OR sequence for selected species
CP coverage of positions along the OR sequence for selected species. CPs coverage of positions along the OR
sequence for pufferfish (A), zebrafish (B), Frog (C) and Human (D). Thresholds mark the regions that are common to all ten
species (B) and new to vertebrates (D). Positions are the same as in Figure. 3.

We identify "novel CPs" as those that exist in the current
ancestor/species but did not exist in previous ancestors
and "lost CPs" are defined as those that exist in the current
ancestor/species but did exist in the previous ancestor.
CPs that date back to previous ancestors are referred to as
"conserved CPs".
Normalizing CP positions
Each CP contains a set of positions relative to the start of
each OR. Due to variable N-Terminal length and gaps, we
needed to normalize the different positions of each CP
appearing in different ORs. We normalized the OR relative positions using ClustalW2 (available at [30]). We first
aligned the five sequences used in [31] to construct a profile (replacing MOR257-1 that was not available in our set
with MOR257-10). Each OR was then aligned to this profile.

Biclustering
Biclustering is performed on the ORs of each species,
using subsets of CPs, each subset corresponding to a different origin on the tree of life. Each OR is represented by
a binary vector that signifies the existence or non-existence of each of the CPs on its sequence. In order to clear
noise, we first removed all ORs having less than 5 CPs
from the relevant tree of life node. We then removed CPs
that appear in less than 5 ORs from the remaining set. ORs
left with no CPs after the previous removal were also
removed. We used a bipartite spectral graph partitioning
algorithm of [32]. Initially designed for documents and
words, this bi-clustering algorithm handles sparse data
well. This algorithm produces biclusters of ORs and CPs.
We augmented the algorithm to produce good biclusters'
images. This was achieved by applying single linkage hierarchical algorithm for each produced bicluster and sorting
each bicluster according to the hierarchical clustering,
thus handling less homogenous clusters better. This aug-

mentation of the algorithm does not alter the assignment
of ORs and CPs to biclusters, but merely provides better
visualization of the biclusters.
