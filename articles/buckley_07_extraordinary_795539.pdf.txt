Abstract
Background: Recent analysis of immune-related genes within the sea urchin genome revealed a
number of large gene families with vertebrate homologues, such as the Toll-like and NOD/NALPlike receptor families and C-type lectins in addition to a rudimentary complement system.
Therefore, the immune response of the purple sea urchin appears to be more complex than
previously believed. Another component of the sea urchin immune response is an unusual family
of mRNAs, known as 185/333, which is strongly upregulated in response to pathogen challenge.
The work presented here indicates that this family of transcripts is derived from an unexpectedly
diverse gene family.
Results: The 185/333 genes are small (< 2 kb) with only two exons. Their extraordinary diversity
was exemplified by 121 unique sequences identified from 171 cloned genes. Sequences from the
second exons were aligned optimally by introducing large gaps, which defined blocks of sequence
known as elements. Genes were defined by the presence or absence of elements. Phylogenetic
analysis defined five intron types which, when combined with the exon element patterns resulted
in 31 gene patterns, 14 of which were not described previously. Sequence diversity was present in
all elements, and was higher in the intron than the exons. Repeats within the sequence facilitated
multiple alignments, of which two were analyzed in detail. Although the two alignments differed in
length, number of elements, and number of patterns, both were about equally accurate at
describing the 185/333 sequences. The genes were closely linked and flanked by short repeats. The
repeats within and between the genes may promote their diversification through gene conversion,
recombination, and meiotic mispairing.
Conclusion: The diversity of the 185/333 gene family represents an intriguing addition to what is
known about the S. purpuratus immune response, and provides further evidence that invertebrate
immune systems are neither simple nor static.

Background
Diversified immune responses provide hosts with advantages in the arms race against pathogens. Diversification
of immune-response proteins enables organisms to detect
and combat a broad array of pathogens with great preci-

sion. Although it was long believed that invertebrate
organisms possessed simple, static immune systems,
recent evidence from numerous organisms suggests that
this may not be correct (reviewed in [1]). In the freshwater
snail, Biomphalaria glabrata, a family of genes encodes

fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs), which contain IgSF
and fibrinogen domains [2-9]. Although it is not known
how many FREP genes are present in the snail genome, at
least 13 subfamilies exist, with some predicted to contain
as many as eight loci. These genes are expressed in
response to trematode parasites and produce a large repertoire of mRNAs that encode a diverse set of proteins. It
is believed that a limited set of source sequences is used to
generate FREP diversity through point mutation and
somatic recombination [6]. A comparably diverse gene
family in amphioxus, Branchiostoma floridae, encodes V
region-containing chitin-binding proteins (VCBP), which
contain two Ig V-type domains [10]. Five subfamilies of
VCBPs are known to exist based on sequence analysis.
Higher plants also have large gene families that encode
resistance (R) proteins. R gene diversity results from extensive recombination, mispairing, gene duplication, and
gene conversion [11-13].
Analysis of the sea urchin genome revealed a number of
large gene families putatively involved in the sea urchin
immune response [14], in addition to the previously identified complement system [14-21]. The S. purpuratus
genome contains 222 predicted gene models that encode
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and 203 that encode NOD/
NALP-like receptors (NLRs) [14]. Both the TLR and NLR
gene families are components of vertebrate innate
immune systems, although with significantly fewer versions (there are 10 TLR and approximately 20 NLR genes
in humans [14]). Although little is known about the functions of these receptor genes in the sea urchin, their diversity suggests that they can recognize a broad range of
pathogenic signatures collectively or combinatorially
[22]. An additional 218 gene models encoding scavenger
receptor cysteine-rich receptors (SRCR) were predicted
from the sea urchin genome [14]. Previous studies have
shown that the expressed SRCR transcript repertoire is
transient in unchallenged sea urchins and changes in
response to injury or pathogenic challenge [23]. SRCRs
are members of a metazoan superfamily with a variety of
functions, including the regulation and development of
vertebrate immune responses [24-26]. Thus, large gene
families appear to be a common theme in the sea urchin
immune response.
Additionally, a diverse set of transcripts called 185/333 is
strongly upregulated in response to a variety of immunological challenges [27-30]. 185/333 sequences are of particular interest due to their diversity and expression
patterns. Of 81 originally characterized 185/333 cDNA
sequences, 67 had unique nucleotide sequences encoding
64 unique protein sequences [27]. Further analysis of
expression patterns indicated that certain 185/333
sequences may be preferentially upregulated in response
to particular pathogen-associated molecular patterns

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/68

(PAMPs) [29]. Alignment of the transcripts required the
insertion of large gaps, creating 25 blocks of sequence
called elements, and an identifiable leader. The sequences
also contained five types of repeats, the borders of which
did not correspond to the element borders. Because individual 185/333 sequences included a variable subset of
elements, their presence and absence were used to define
element patterns. Specific patterns observed in numerous
clones defined cDNA sets [27]. Although the mRNA structure strongly implied alternative splicing [27], two assembled 185/333 genes from an early assembly of the S.
purpuratus genome indicated that, with the exception of
the leader, all elements were located on a single exon [30].
Due to the substantial diversity of the mRNA and the
unexpectedly simple gene structure, it was of interest to
characterize the 185/333 gene family more closely.
The results presented here illustrate that the observed 185/
333 transcript diversity is at least partially the result of a
highly diverse family of genes present in the sea urchin
genome. Previous studies suggest that there are about 100
different 185/333 alleles per sea urchin [30]. The diversity
of 185/333 is illustrated by the fact that 71% of 171 cloned
and sequenced genes were unique, and from these, 33 element patterns were identified, about half of which were
newly described. From this and previous studies
[27,29,30], a total of 51 element patterns are now known
from 16 S. purpuratus individuals. We also show that the
closely linked genes are flanked by short repeats, which
may facilitate diversification through gene conversion,
recombination, or meiotic mispairing. Overall the data
show that the 185/333 gene family represents a new example of molecular diversity among invertebrate immune
systems.

Results
The 185/333 genes are variable in size
Searches of the initial assembly of the S. purpuratus
genome (assembly 09/22/03; http://hgsc.bcm.tmc.edu/
projects/seaurchin) identified two 185/333 genes, which
were small (<2 kb) [30]. It was therefore feasible to analyze entire genes amplified by PCR from genomic DNA
(gDNA) using primers flanking the 185/333 coding region
(185-5'UTR and 185-3'UTR; Table 1). Analysis of the 185/
333 genes using PCR revealed five major sizes of genes
ranging from 1.2 to 2.0 kb. A representative result from
one of six sea urchins is shown in Figure 1A. Amplicons
derived from three different sea urchins were cloned and
sequenced. In total, 171 genes were cloned and sequenced
from gDNA: 87 genes from animal 2 coelomocytes, 34
genes from animal 4 coelomocytes, and 50 genes from
animal 10 sperm. Clones with identical nucleotide
sequence were assumed to be derived from the same gene
and omitted from further analysis. In total, 121 unique
genes were identified: 53 from animal 2, 30 from animal

4, and 38 from animal 10. The genes ranged in size from
1206 to 1894 nucleotides (nt) (Figure 1A; Additional file
1). The structure of all cloned genes was consistent with
previous data [30] and had two exons separated by a small
intron. The first exon was short (51 or 54 nt) and encoded
the leader, whereas the much longer second exon (771–
1431 nt) encoded the remainder of the open reading
frame (ORF). The intron ranged in size from 380 to 413
nt (average = 407 nt). Although a minor band of ~4 kb
was also observed, no genes larger than 2 kb were cloned.
Therefore, the structures of these putative genes are
unknown.
Elements and patterns
Exon 2 elements
To align the gene sequences optimally, large gaps were
inserted that created discrete sections of sequence called
elements (Figure 2A, Additional file 2 and Additional file
3). The borders of the elements located within the second
exon were defined based on the positions of gaps in an
alignment of 185/333 cDNAs [30]. All 25 previously identified elements were found among the gene sequences,
and no new elements were found. The elements, named
Ex1–25, to indicate that they are located within the exon,
ranged in size from 12 to 357 nt (Additional file 4). All
genes contained elements Ex1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 25,
whereas Ex23 was found in only three out of 171 genes.
Previously, seven subelements of Ex15 were defined from
the cDNA sequences based on length [30] all of which
were found in the gene sequences. Subelements Ex15a,
Ex15c, Ex15f, and Ex15g were identified from single sea
urchins (Figure 2A), suggesting that Ex15 subtypes may
not be present in all members of the population.

The terminal element in both the cDNA [30] and gene
sequences, Ex25, was characterized by stop codons in
three locations, which divided Ex25 into three regions,
Ex25a (138 nt), 25b (57 nt) and 25c (Additional file 2 and

Additional file 3). The final stop codon, which defined
element Ex25c, was not found in the gene sequences
because the primer used for cloning (185-3'UTR; Table 1)
was located in 25c just 5' of the third stop codon. Furthermore, there were three distinct subtypes of element Ex25b
in the cDNA sequences based on the presence or absence
of a series of gaps in one of two positions [30], all of
which were also identified among the gene sequences
(Additional file 2, Additional file 3).
The frequency with which each of the elements was
present within the clones was relatively constant among
the three animals studied (data not shown). The exceptions were pairs of mutually exclusive elements, of which
one or the other was found in all clones analyzed. One
such pair of elements was Ex10 and Ex12. In animal 2,
66% of clones had element 10 and 34% had Ex12,
whereas in animal 4, 87% of clones had element 10 and
16% had Ex12. It is of note that Ex10 and Ex12 were 92%
similar at the nucleotide level and therefore may encode
regions of similar function in the protein.
Patterns
Exon element patterns
The variable presence of individual exon elements in the
gene sequences defined 27 different exon element patterns, of which fourteen had not been defined previously
[29,30] (Figure 2A; asterisked patterns). As previously
noted [30], subtypes of Ex15 correlated with the presence
or absence of suites of other elements and were used to
define groups of patterns. These associations also held for
the gene sequences (Table 2; Figure 2A). Furthermore,
Ex21 and Ex22 were always found together, and the pair
was mutually exclusive with Ex24, unless Ex23 was
present. Ex10 and Ex12 were also mutually exclusive, as
noted above. These two elements were distinguished by
the first amino acid of the element (Ex10 either had a proline or a leucine, whereas Ex12 had a histidine). Ex14 and

*Elements Ex1–4, 7–9, and 25 were omitted because they were present in all genes (Figure 2A)
+Elements Er1, 2, 5, 6, 26, and 27 were omitted because they were present in all genes (Figure 6)

Ex15 always occurred together, regardless of the Ex15 subtype (Figure 2A). Therefore, not only did suites of elements appear in association with subtypes of Ex15, but
elements also commonly appeared either in association
with or in the absence of other elements.
Genes with Ex15a or Ex15g (element patterns A1, G2 and
G3) had nearly identical combinations of elements (Table
2; Figure 2A). Ex15g and Ex15a may therefore represent
population-level differences of a single Ex15 subtype
rather than two distinct subtypes. This was supported by
the fact that a) each subtype was isolated from an individual animal, b) element Ex15g was only a single amino
acid longer than Ex15a and was otherwise identical in
sequence, and c) the element patterns of these genes were
very similar. However, a single clone (10-013; Additional
file 1), with element pattern G3, contained most of the
typical group A/G hallmarks, but lacked elements Ex23
and Ex24 (Figure 2A). Of the more than 810 gene and
transcript sequences analyzed thus far [29,30], Ex15a and
Ex15g always occurred in association with Ex23, with the

exception of G3. Furthermore, the sequence of the G3
clone was identical to the single G2 clone from the same
animal, with the exception of the absence of Ex23 and
Ex24 (Additional file 2). Therefore, the G3 type gene may
have arisen as a result of a duplication of the G2 gene, followed by a deletion of elements Ex23 and 24.
Intron types
The intron sequences were aligned and compared using
phylogenetics. Intron types were found between 4 (ε) and
54 (α) times. There was strong support to separate the
introns into five major clades (α-ε), however, the relationships among the intron sequences within each major
clade was generally unresolved (Figure 3). The resulting
tree indicated two larger clades composed of intron types
δ and γ, and intron types α, β, or ε, which illustrates
sequence similarities among the introns. Genes were
therefore named according to exon pattern and intron
type (i.e., gene pattern D1α had exon element pattern D1
and intron type α).

Amplification of 185/333 sequences
Amplification of 185/333 sequences. A. gDNA from animal 2 was amplified by PCR using primers flanking the 185/
333 genes (185-5'UTR and 185-3'UTR; see Table 1) and
showed bands of five major sizes from 1.2 to 2 kb and a
minor band around 4 kb. Triangles indicate the positions of
each of the bands. Similar amplification of gDNA from six
additional animals had identical patterns of bands (data not
shown). B. Amplification of intergenic regions by PCR using
primers that annealed within genes but were oriented away
from each other (185-LR1 and 185-F5 primers; Table 1)
revealed a major band in all animals of about 3 kb (lanes 1–4,
animals 10–13). C. gDNA from animal 2 was amplified by
PCR using primers that annealed in the 5' UTR (185-5' UTR;
Table 1) and the type I repeats found in elements Ex4, Ex5,
and Ex6(185-R5; Table 1) and revealed the presence of genes
that lacked introns. Animal 2 gDNA (lane 1) shows a band of
450 bp (indicated with a carrot). A cDNA (Sp0313,
DQ183171; lane 2) also amplifies a band of about 450 bp. A
cloned gene (2-02, Additional file 1; GenBank accession
number EF607673; lane 3) with a typical intron amplifies a
band within the range of bands in A. D. PCR amplification of
185/333 from eight different BAC clones using primers (1855'UTR and 185-3'UTR; Table 1). Each lane contains template
DNA from a different BAC (1, 126J14; 2, 108H07; 3,
053M03; 4, 121A07; 5, 004D19; 6, 182N21; 7, 148J22; 8,
019L13).

A total of 31 gene element patterns were defined by the
combination of exon element patterns and intron types
(Figure 2A; Figure 3), 12 of which formed gene sets composed of two or more unique genes with identical element
patterns. Eight patterns were collected from more than
one animal. Genes that formed sets were isolated from
either a single animal (D5ε was present only in animal 2),
or from all three animals (E2δ). The three patterns shared
among all three animals, E2δ, D1α, and 01δ display
increased transcription after sea urchins are challenged
with various PAMPs [29]. The most commonly observed
transcript pattern, E2, was found 12 times among the
genes, suggesting that its increased transcription may
result from an increased number of genes.
Generally, exon element patterns correlated with intron
type (Figure 2A). However, there were three instances in
which genes with the same exon element patterns had different intron types. Exon element pattern 01 correlated
with three different intron types, α, δ, or ε. Gene pattern
01δ was identified in the majority of the 01 clones (17 of
the 19 01 clones), whereas 01α and 01ε were isolated only
once (Figure 2A). Exon element patterns E3 and B3 also
had different intron types (E3 genes had either intron α or
δ, whereas B3 genes had either introns α or β). Genes with
identical intron element patterns also had different exon
element patterns, such as C3α and D1α (Figure 2A; Figure
3). Therefore, although exon element patterns typically
correlated with a single intron type, there were examples
when they did not.
Diversity
As expected from previous analyses of the cDNA
sequences [27,29,30], the 185/333 genes comprise an
exceptionally diverse family. Identical gene sequences
were not shared among the three sea urchins. Taq-induced
polymorphisms and template switching were ruled out as
sources of diversity (Additional file 5). To quantify the
diversity, two approaches were employed: calculations of
entropy-based diversity scores and ratios of synonymous
to non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions [30]. Diversity scores were calculated as in [29,30] using a formula
based on the method of [31], and depend upon the frequency of the nucleotides or amino acids at each alignment position, but are independent of the sequence
length or size of the data set. Although the maximum possible diversity score is 1.609, a more realistic biological
maximum score might be similar to that previously
observed for element 11 from expressed cDNA sequences
[30], or about 0.600. Diversity scores provide a means to
identify variable regions, and can be used to compare the
diversity of different elements or different sets of genes.

based on alignments of cDNA sequences. The insertion of gaps (black lines), which defined the 25 elements (shown as colored
boxes) [30]. A consensus sequence containing all the elements and the locations of the two exons is shown at the top. The
source of each gDNA is indicated by the colored dots in the columns labeled "Animal". Blue dots indicate that the pattern was
isolated from animal 2, red dots from animal 4, and green dots from animal 10. The frequency with which the patterns were

non-conserved Ex15 subtypes (Ex15b, Ex15d, and Ex15e)
were < 0.0471 (Figure 4A). Likewise, the nucleotide diversity of Ex25a was much lower than the diversity of Ex25b
(0.0495 vs. 0.3237, respectively), due to the three subtypes of Ex25b. When analyzed separately, the Ex25b variants also had considerably lower scores (nucleotide
diversity scores of Ex25b1 = 0.0977; Ex25b2 = 0.0165;
Ex25b3 = 0.0079). The exon element diversity varied
throughout the sequence of the genes and greatly
increased when element subtypes were analyzed together.
The overall sequence diversity in the dataset stemmed
from the interplay between four possible sources: a) SNPs
present only in individual genes (unshared variations), b)
the number of variable positions in an alignment, c) the
number of states in each alignment position, and d) the
number of unique sequences. Because diversity scores rely
on the frequency of each state in each alignment position,
changes that occur in a single sequence have minimal
effects on the overall diversity. However, as the total
number of sequences decreases, the impact of these variations on the overall diversity scores increases. The range of
percent variable positions among the elements was 0
(Ex11) to 88.9% (Ex15). Ex15 had both the greatest percent of variable positions and the highest nucleotide
diversity score. The average number of states per variable
nucleotide position among the elements (excluding the
conserved
Ex11)
was
2.1.

Phylogenetic tree of intron sequences
Phylogenetic tree of intron sequences. Intron
sequences were aligned manually (Additional file 2). Maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony methods both produced the unrooted tree shown. The five major clades were
used to define the five intron types, as shown.

Nucleotide diversity of the elements
Analysis of the exon element diversity scores indicated
that, with the exception of elements Ex15 and Ex25b, the
nucleotide diversity ranged from 0 to 0.1364 (Ex2) (average = 0.0846 ± 0.0878), and was distributed throughout
all of the elements (Figure 4A). Two dissimilar versions of
element 11 were identified from the cDNA sequences,
which was the source of the high diversity score [30].
However, only a single, entirely conserved version of Ex11
(equivalent to Ex11b [30]), was identified in the gene
sequences. Elements Ex25b and Ex15 had the highest
diversity scores (0.3237 and 0.4093, respectively) as a
result of the subtypes of these elements. When subtypes
were analyzed separately, diversity scores for the three

A set of unique element sequences was generated from the
combination of unique SNPs and variable position characteristics. Each exon element had a suite of distinct, but
related, nucleotide sequences, with an average of 11.2
unique sequences per exon element (Table 3; Additional
file 4). The number of and differences among these
sequences was the primary factor in the diversity scores.
Increased element diversity scores correlated with
increased numbers of unique element sequences. Ex4 and
Ex20 were identified 121 and 120 times, respectively, but
Ex4 had 21 unique sequences and a higher nucleotide
diversity score (0.1278) than element Ex20 (0.0619),
which had eight distinct sequences (Additional file 4).
Overall, the four diversity characteristics influenced the
diversity scores by varying amounts and were useful
means by which to characterize and compare the elements.
Amino acid sequence diversity of the elements
The diversity of the amino acid sequences encoded by the
exon elements was analyzed using the same approaches
used to characterize nucleotide diversity. Overall, amino
acid element diversity ranged from 0 to 0.4977 (Ex15;
average = 0.1350 ± 0.1120; Figure 4A, gray bars), and generally correlated with nucleotide element diversity scores.
The average number of unshared variations for the amino

Diversity
Diversity of the 185/333 gene elements. Nucleotide diversity scores (black bars) and amino acid diversity scores (gray
bars) of individual exon elements are shown. The average element nucleotide diversity is indicated by a dashed black line and
average element amino acid diversity is shown as a dashed gray line. The absolute range of diversity scores is 0 (entirely conserved) to 1.609 for nucleotide alignments (based on an even distribution of five states: four nucleotides and a gap) or 3.044 for
amino acid alignments (21 possible states) [30]. The highest element diversity score previously observed was from element 11
(0.5381) from a set of cDNAs isolated from bacterially-challenged coelomocytes pooled from five animals [30]. This score was
similar to that obtained from a modeled element in which 40% of the positions contained four different states in 20% of the
sequences. Elements with a diversity score of 0 were omitted (Ex11, Ex15a, Ex15c, and Ex15f-g of the cDNA-based alignment
(A) and Er7, Er10a, Er10c, Er10f-g, Er12 -13, Er18, and Er20 of the repeat-based alignment (B). The number (#), length in
nucleotides (L) and nucleotide to amino acid diversity ratio (R) are indicated in the table to the left of the graphs. Ex25 includes
both Ex25a and Ex25b. Ex25a includes all sequences from the start of Ex25 up to and including the first stop codon. Ex25b
includes only the sequence following the first stop codon to the second stop codon (Additional file 2 and Additional file 3). Element Er27 in the repeat-based alignment (B) is treated similarly.

Diversity of nucleotide positions
Diversity of nucleotide positions. A. Each bar represents the nucleotide diversity of a single nucleotide position within the
alignment of all cloned 185/333 genes. Green bars represent nucleotide positions within the intron. Gaps due to missing elements were excluded from the diversity calculations. B. Hypervariable positions within the 185/333 genes were identified using
diversity analysis on clones belonging to cDNA-based sets (Table 5) with more than two members (94 genes total). Because
sets had variable numbers of members, which artificially increases diversity for positions in sets with fewer members, each
diversity score greater than 0 was assigned a value of 1. Each bar in the graph represents the number of sets (out of 8 total)
that contained a polymorphism at the specific nucleotide position. Green bars indicate positions within the intron. Bars below
the x-axis denote the borders between elements (cDNA-based alignment).

acid element sequences was 2.81, with a maximum of 24
in Ex7. On average, 38% of amino acid positions were variable, higher than the average number of variable nucleotide positions (26%), underscoring the high number of
nonsynonymous substitutions within the data set. The
average number of states per variable position over all elements was similar to that observed in the nucleotide
alignments (2.2 for amino acids vs. 2.1 for nucleotides).
The highest average number of states per variable position
within an element was Ex21, which had 3. However, this
number is low, given that the theoretical maximum
number of states per position is 21 amino acids. Furthermore, the average number of unique amino acid
sequences is lower than that in the nucleotide alignments
(8.7 for amino acids vs. 11.2 for nucleotides). Therefore,
although some of the diversity is masked in the encoded
proteins by synonymous substitutions, if all of the genes
are translated, much of the diversity would permeate
through to generate a highly diverse pool of proteins.
Ratios of nucleotide and amino acid diversity scores
Ratios of the nucleotide vs. amino acid diversity scores
(diversity ratios) provided insight into the relative levels
of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions
among the elements [29,30]. This approach was implemented because the elements were generally too short to

determine dn/ds ratios using PAML [32]. If each nucleotide change resulted in an amino acid change, the ratio
of amino acid diversity to nucleotide diversity would
equal 3 because the number of variable positions and the
diversity of those positions would remain constant, but
the length of the nt vs. amino acid sequence would differ
by a factor of 3 (3 nucleotides encode 1 amino acid).
However, if all nucleotide changes were silent, the resulting amino acid diversity and diversity ratio would equal 0.
Specifically, the diversity ratio indicates how many of the
three variable positions in a codon result in non-synonymous changes. A high diversity ratio indicates primarily
non-synonymous changes, and a low ratio indicates
mostly synonymous changes. There was no correlation
between diversity ratios and diversity scores.
The two elements with diversity ratios of less than 1 (fewer
than one out of three nucleotide changes resulted in an
amino acid change) were Ex19 (0.83) and Ex21 (0.60),
suggesting that these elements had the greatest number of
synonymous nucleotide substitutions (Figure 4A). Elements with ratios greater than 2.5 were Ex1, Ex8, Ex10,
Ex22, Ex23, and Ex24 (Figure 4A). Ex8, Ex10, Ex23, and
Ex24 exhibited artificially high ratios due to a low number
of nucleotide changes, most of which encoded non-synonymous changes. For example, Ex23 had two non-syn-

onymous nucleotide mutations that resulted in a ratio
close to 3. Overall, 15 of the 25 elements were characterized by diversity ratios of at least 1.5 (Figure 4A), indicating that, on average for these elements, half of the
nucleotide substitutions resulted in a nonsynonymous
amino acid change. The amino acid diversity scores therefore illustrated that not only are the 185/333 genes
diverse, but much of this diversity encodes changes to the
amino acid sequence.
Diversity of the intron
The diversity of the intron sequences was measured using
the same characteristics as those used to understand the
diversity of the exon elements. To compare intron and
exon diversity, diversity characteristics for the entire second exon were analyzed disregarding all gaps (including
those that defined the elements). Therefore, the values for
the second exon were lower than when the second exon
was analyzed including gaps as a fifth state. The diversity
of the intron was over 3 times higher than the second
exon (Table 3). This elevated diversity resulted from a significant increase in the percent variable positions in the
intron (with respect to the lengths of the entire alignments). Within the intron sequence, ~40% of the alignment positions were variable, as compared to only 18% in
the second exon (Table 3).
Diversity of individual nucleotide positions
Diversity of individual nucleotide positions across all
genes was analyzed, omitting gaps, and results indicated
that diversity was relatively constant throughout the alignment with no strikingly hypervariable regions (Figure 5A).
The positional nucleotide diversity scores ranged from 0
to 1.0677 (position 2046, located in Ex25; Additional File
1), with an average of 0.0773. A few conserved stretches

were apparent, such as Ex23, which had only two variable
positions, in addition to regions within Ex5 and Ex11
were noticeably more conserved than the rest of the
sequence. Because most of the variability resulted from
differences among the unique element sequences, diversity was calculated for each position for each set of genes
with shared element patterns (Figure 5B). To normalize
the unequal number of members in a gene set, the
number of sets containing polymorphisms at each position within the alignment was calculated. This approach
identified positions that were commonly variable among
genes with identical element patterns and disregarded
inter-set differences (Figure 5B). There were 632 variable
positions in the entire alignment of 2298 nucleotides.
However, only 105 positions were polymorphic among
the different sets. Three adjacent sites were polymorphic
in five of the eight sets that composed a single codon indel
located in the leader (nt positions 4–6, Additional file 2).
There were 12 positions in which four of the sets were polymorphic; three were located in the intron, eight were in
Ex25, and one was in Ex 7 (Additional file 2). Therefore,
much of the diversity appeared to be the result of differences among sets, and was not concentrated in specific
regions of the alignment, but rather, was distributed
throughout the sequence.
The overall diversity for the entire 185/333 nucleotide
alignment, including gaps as a fifth state, was 0.2692. Separating the sequences by source animal resulted in diversity scores of 0.2532 for the genes from animal 2, 0.2253
for the genes from animal 4, and 0.2856 for the genes
from animal 10. If the gene sets were congruous and their
combination did not produce any additional diversity, the
diversity score for the entire set of genes would be equal to
average of the scores from individual animals, weighted

Repeat-based alignment of the 185/333 genes
Repeat-based alignment of the 185/333 genes. The alignment was optimized for repeats and 27 elements (colored
boxes) were defined. Gaps due to missing elements are indicated by horizontal black lines. There are 17 different exon element patterns, which, when combined with the intron types (Figure 3), form a total of 21 unique gene patterns. The frequency
(Freq) of patterns indicates how often the pattern was identified. The source animal for each pattern is indicated by the presence of a colored dot as in Figure 2. The subtype of element Er10 (which corresponds to Ex15, Figure 2A) is indicated by the
letter in the box. Intron types are unaffected by this alignment because they do not have repeats; their designation corresponds
to that shown in Figure 3.

by the number of genes isolated from each animal. This
weighted average was 0.2565, slightly lower than the
observed value. This phenomenon of higher diversity for
genes from all three animals combined was not limited to
the results from the analysis of the entire alignment, but
also to individual elements. For example, Ex5 was conserved within individual animals, but had a diversity score
of 0.0185 when all three animals were combined. The
increased diversity score for genes from the three animals
combined indicated that gene sequences from a single

animal were more conserved than the collection of genes
across animals. These differences underscored not only
the diversity of members of this gene family, but also the
diversity of the 185/333 genes within the population.
Repeat-based alignment
In agreement with previous analysis of 185/333 cDNA
sequence alignments [27,30], five types of repeats were
identified in the gene sequences (shown as colored boxes
in Figure 2A). Type 1 tandem repeats (red in Figure 2A)

Repeat-based alignment
Figure 7
Correlation of elements in the cDNA-based and repeat-based alignments
Correlation of elements in the cDNA-based and repeat-based alignments. The elements of the cDNA-based and
repeat-based alignments are shown as blocks. Lines connecting the blocks indicate the relative positions of elements in the two
alignments. In elements ExL to Ex7 and ErL to Er6, the elements correlate closely between the two alignments. Only elements
Ex1 and Ex2 of the cDNA-based alignment are merged to form Er1 in the repeat-based alignment. In Ex8 to Ex25, however,
the sequences are interdigitated to accommodate the alignment of the repeats, particularly those in Ex23.

were located in Ex2–7; repeat types 2 through 5 were
located in Ex16–23 in mixed groups of interspersed
repeats. There was no correlation between the edges of the
elements and the edges of the repeats in previous alignments [27,30] or that shown in Figure 2. Furthermore, in
the gene alignments, element borders for Ex1–4 were not
supported by gaps as in previous message alignments (Figure 2A). Consequently, we explored the possibility of an
alternative alignment such that the element borders were
defined by the repeats. By modifying the alignment
shown in Figure 2 (the cDNA-based alignment) to correlate the edges of the repeats and elements, the set of 185/
333 genes was re-aligned into the repeat-based alignment
(Figure 6; Additional file 6 and 7). Elements in the repeatbased alignment were designated Er1 through Er27.
The relationship between the elements of the cDNA-based
and repeat-based alignments is shown in Figure 7. The
edges of the elements for Er1–5 were altered according to
the type 1 repeats and Ex1 and Ex2 were merged to form
Er1. Ex7 through Ex10 and Ex12 were not defined by gaps
in the gene sequences, and were therefore merged to form
Er6. To realign the sequences to be in accordance with
repeat types 2 through 5, the sequences were interdigitated. As a result Ex23 was divided into six smaller elements in the repeat-based alignment (Er12, 13, 15, 18, 19,
and 20; Figure 7). Ex22 and Ex24 were very similar in
sequence and were merged into part of Er26. Elements
Ex15 and Ex25 were maintained including their subtypes,
but were renumbered Er10 and Er27. Therefore, due to the
repeats and elements that were unsupported by gaps in
the gene sequences, realigning the 185/333 genes resulted
in an agreement between element and repeat borders.

Although the repeat-based alignment had 27 elements, it
was shorter than the cDNA-based alignment (Figure 7;
Table 4). Overall, the repeat-based elements ranged in
length from 11 nt (Er16) to 192 nt (Er27), with an average
of 56 nt (Table 4). As in the cDNA-based alignment,
repeat-based elements were present in varying frequencies, from 2% (Er12, Er13, Er18, Er19, and Er20) to 100%
(ErL, Er1, Er2, Er5, Er6, Er26, and Er27) of the clones. As
a result of sequence interdigitation, there were fewer
repeats of types 3, 4, and 5 (Table 4).
Repeat-based alignment element patterns
The presence or absence of 27 elements from the second
exon of the repeat-based alignment defined 14 unique
patterns (Figure 6), fewer than the 27 patterns identified
in the cDNA-based alignment (Figure 2A; Table 3). Element patterns from the repeat-based alignment have been
designated with an r in front of the pattern name. Some
gene sets were unaffected by the alignment changes (e.g.,
A1 became rA1). Other cDNA-based element patterns
were merged to form repeat-based patterns; E2δ, E3δ, and
E7δ were combined in the repeat-based alignment to form
gene set rE2/3/7δ. The majority of repeat-based patterns
were defined by the presence or absence of elements Er3,
Er14, Er16, Er17, and Er21 through Er25 (Figure 6). The
most common repeat-based pattern was rD1/6/7 (38
genes), whereas twelve patterns were defined by single
genes. As in the cDNA-based alignment, genes containing
either Er10a or Er10g were distinct from the rest of the
dataset because they also had Er4, Er7, Er12–16, and
Er18–27 (Table 2). Repeat-based element patterns largely
correlated with intron type, with the same exceptions as
those in the cDNA-based alignment (Figure 6).

#Repeat-based elements are denoted by an r before the set name.
*Gene sets that were not different between the two alignments.
^Gene sets in the repeat-based alignment that were merged from two or more cDNA-based alignment sets.
§A score of 1.5 indicates that changes in half of the nucleotides are nonsynonymous.

Element diversity analysis
To understand how modifying the alignment affected
sequence diversity, nucleotide and amino acid diversity
scores were calculated for the repeat-based elements (Figure 4B) and the overall alignment. The overall alignment
nucleotide sequence diversity and average element diversity for the repeat-based alignment were slightly lower
than those of the cDNA-based alignment (Table 4). Due
to the element subtypes, elements Er10 and Er27b had the
highest nucleotide diversity (similar to Ex15 and Ex25;
Figure 7). One explanation for the decreased average
repeat-based element diversity score was an increased
number of conserved elements: five in the repeat-based
alignment, compared to one in the cDNA-based alignment (Figure 4).
Diversity of the gene sets
In addition to analyzing element diversity, it was of interest to understand diversity across the entire sequence. This
analysis, however, was confounded by the gaps required
to optimize the alignment. Therefore, we determined the
diversity scores for sets of genes with the same exon element pattern and intron type, thereby circumventing the
problem introduced by the gaps. Diversity scores were calculated for thirteen sets with three or more members from
both alignments, which included or omitted the intron
(Table 5). Results indicated that the average diversity of
gene sets (0.0214) was significantly lower than the average diversity of all cDNA-based elements from all genes
(0.0668), despite the fact that the genes were much longer
than individual elements. Nucleotide diversity of gene
sets ranged from 0.0044 (pattern F1β) to 0.0549 (rE2/3/7/
8/9δ; Figure 5, Table 5). This lower diversity implied that

genes with identical element patterns also tended to have
elements with similar sequences. Furthermore, in eight of
the 13 sets, the nucleotide diversity for entire genes (exons
and intron) was lower than the diversity for the exons
without the intron (Table 5). This implied that, for genes
with the same exon element pattern, the intron was at
least as conserved, if not more so, than the exons. This
result was supported by the diversity analysis of the intron
sequences. The diversity of all 55 intron type α sequences
associated with a variety of different exon element patterns was 0.0261, whereas the diversity for the α intron
sequences from just the genes with the D1α exon element
pattern was about half that (0.0159). This indicated that
genes with identical element patterns were more closely
related to one another by nucleotide sequence than genes
with different element patterns.
To understand the effect of nucleotide substitutions on
the encoded protein sequence, gene sets from both alignments were subjected to two parallel lines of investigation: calculations of synonymous vs. non-synonymous
(dn/ds) ratios [32], and ratios of nucleotide to amino acid
diversity scores (Table 5). Of the 13 sets analyzed, five
(01δ, r01δ/8, D1α, rD1/6/7α, and E3δ) had dn/ds ratios
greater than 1, indicating positive (diversifying) selection
(shown in bold, Table 5). Two of these sets also had the
highest diversity ratios (those with the most non-synonymous substitutions): E3δ, and r01δ/8. The set with least
non-synonymous substitutions, B3α/rB3α, also had a low
dn/ds ratio. There was not a strong correlation between
the dn/ds values and the diversity ratios because PAMLbased dn/ds analysis incorporates an amino acid similarity matrix, whereas the diversity ratios weight all amino

acid substitutions equally. The average diversity ratio for
the sets was 1.62, indicating that over half (1.62 of every
3) of the nucleotide substitutions resulted in a non-synonymous amino acid substitution. The average set diversity for the repeat-based alignment was slightly higher
than that for the cDNA-based alignment (Table 4; Table
5), which may have been due to merging elements to generate the repeat-based alignment. Merging Ex10 and Ex12
increased the diversity score to 0.1197, compared to
0.0807 and 0.0766 when analyzed separately. Understanding the effects of nucleotide diversity on the encoded
protein sequences provides some insight into the resulting
pool of proteins.
Although it is unusual for a set of sequences to be aligned
multiple ways with about equal characteristics, the repeats
within the 185/333 sequences enabled this result. Each of
the alignments defined different numbers of elements
based on repeats and/or gaps within the sequences, and
the presence or absence of those elements defined a series
of patterns into which all of the genes could be classified.
It was noteworthy that neither alignment proved significantly better at describing the diversity of the gene elements or sets. Due to the high levels of diversity found
among the 185/333 sequences, it is likely that future analyses will uncover additional alignments that will refine
our current understanding of these sequences.
BAC screening and intronless genes
A small BAC library constructed from S. purpuratus gDNA
[33] was screened to identify clones containing 185/333
genes. In total, 48 BACs (of 92,160 in the library) were
positive for 185/333 genes. Further analysis of these BACs
by PCR using 185/333-specific primers (185-5'UTR and
185-3'UTR; Table 1) revealed that all 48 amplified at least
one, and sometimes up to 10 bands (Figure 1D). We have
assumed that each band represents one or more 185/333
genes in the BAC sequence, most of which were within the
typical size range. However, some bands were notably
smaller than expected (< 1 kb; Figure 1D). Cloning and
sequencing of these bands revealed that these genes did
not have an intron (Figure 2B; Additional file 8).

In total, 12 clones were sequenced from two BACs
(091G11, n = 8; and 190D12, n = 4), of which five were
unique, three contained introns (patterns D1α, 01δ, and
B3β) and two were intronless (Figure 2B). Two of the
sequences were isolated from both BACs, suggesting that
the BAC inserts overlap. The two intronless clones had
exon patterns E2 (named E2x) and previously unidentified pattern, E2.7 (Figure 2B). E2.7 was unique because it
had the same element pattern as E2δ, but contained an 88
bp deletion spanning elements Ex2 through Ex3 (Er1 and
Er2). This deletion did not correspond with a repeat or an
intact element and introduced a frameshift that resulted

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/68

in missense sequence and a stop codon 23 bp after the
deletion. It was therefore possible that E2.7 was a pseudogene, perhaps the only one identified from 126 unique
genes analyzed.
Additional evidence for the presence of intronless genes
was acquired by amplifying genomic DNA using primers
that annealed in the 5'UTR (185-5'UTR; Table 1) and in
the type 1 repeats of elements Ex4, Ex5, and Ex6 (185-R5;
Table 1). A fragment of ~450 bp was amplified from
genomic DNA from animal 2, which was too short to
include a typical 400 bp intron (Figure 1C, lane 1). This
region was similar in size to that amplified from a cDNA
clone, Sp0313 (DQ183171, [27]) using the same primers
(Figure 1C, lane 2). The low frequency of intronless clones
within the 185/333 gene family may account for our inability to detect smaller fragments when the entire genome
was used as the template.
Gene locus structure
Because multiple 185/333 genes were present on individual BACs, we used PCR to investigate the size of intergenic
regions. Amplification of genomic DNA from four animals using primers 185-F5 and 185-LR1 (Table 1) showed
that the major intergenic size was ~3 kb (Figure 1B).
Bands of various sizes, ranging from about 1.6 kb to 8 kb,
indicated that spacing between the genes was variable
among the four animals analyzed. Given the constraints
of PCR, it was possible that some genes were too far apart
for successful intergenic amplification. A representative
genomic scaffold from the sea urchin genome (assembly
v. 2, 6/15/06) contained four genes spaced 3, 3.5 and 13.4
kb apart (Figure 8). Intergenic sequence from the contigs
revealed that the genes were flanked on the both sides by
a stretch of ~15 dinucleotide (GA) repeats, and also on the
5' side by trinucleotide repeats. Although the significance
of these repeats is unknown, preliminary cloning and
sequencing of the region upstream of 17 185/333 genes
indicates that the dinucleotide repeats are commonly
present (Kim and Smith, unpublished).

Discussion
Previous reports described the sequences and expression
patterns of the 185/333 transcripts [27,29,30]. The data
presented here detail the structure and diversity of the
185/333 genes and suggest that they compose a large family of linked genes within the S. purpuratus genome. The
typical gene structure has two exons separated by a single
intron, although genes lacking introns are also present in
the genome. Based on repeats within the genes, multiple
alignments of the 185/333 sequences are possible. The
two alignments utilized in this study define elements
based on large gaps employed for one of two reasons: to
align the transcript sequences [27,29,30], or to optimize
the repeats. The presence/absence of the elements defines

location. The element patterns of the genes are based on the cDNA-based alignment are indicated. Pattern D8 was not isolated

element patterns (33 patterns in the cDNA-based alignment and 17 patterns in the repeat-based alignment). The
high level of diversity of the genes is exemplified by the
121 distinct genes among the 171 that were cloned and
sequenced. Diversity is distributed throughout the
sequence, and varies among the elements. The 121 unique
gene sequences encode 101 unique amino acid sequences,
indicating that the genetic diversity extends to the
encoded proteins. Half of the gene sets, composed of
unique genes with identical element patterns, are under
positive selection according to dn/ds analysis. The 185/
333 genes (100 ± 20 alleles [30]) are typically spaced
about 3 kb apart, and are flanked by short repeats. The
185/333 gene family is therefore composed of a suite of
closely linked, highly diverse genes.
Gene diversity
Although initial reports of the 185/333 sequences suggested that their diversity may be the result of putative
alternative splicing [27], the data presented here support
the previous conclusion [30] that the element pattern
diversity observed among the 185/333 transcripts is not
the result of alternative splicing, but resides within the second exon. With one exception (element 11a), all of the
elements found in the message sequences were also identified among the genes, and no new elements were found.
Other than the single intron located directly after the
leader sequence, no additional introns were identified.
However, larger amplicons (~4 kb) were observed when
genomic DNA was amplified with primers flanking the
genes (Figure 1A). Although nothing is known about the
sequence of these genes, there are three possible explanations for these fragments: (1) genes with duplications of
currently known elements, or additional elements that are
currently unknown; (2) genes in which the primer annealing sites were mutated or missing, causing the amplification to skip over genes; (3) genes with larger or more
introns. Analysis of the 185/333 locus in which many of

the genes reside will be required to understand the PCR
results. However, based on the frequency of genes in
which the second exon encodes the majority of the open
reading frame, it is unlikely that alternative splicing is the
primary mechanism to generate the diverse array of element patterns observed among the transcript sequences.
In a previous study [29], half of the expressed transcripts
contained an early stop codon which, if translated, would
encode missense or truncated proteins. It is curious that,
given the frequency of these messages and the number of
genes cloned and sequenced, with one exception (pattern
E2.7), no early stop codons or frameshifts were found in
any of the gene sequences. Element pattern E2.1, which
has a SNP generated stop codon in Ex10 and constitutes
65% of the 185/333 messages in coelomocytes prior to
challenge and 33% of 185/333 messages after challenge
with various antigens, was not found among the gene
sequences, despite the fact that animals 2 and 4, from
which E2.1 transcripts were isolated, were also the source
of gDNA in this study. It is possible that an E2.1 gene is
present within the genome of these two animals and was
simply not cloned. Alternatively, the 185/333 messages
may be post-transcriptionally modified through as yet
unknown mechanisms that introduce SNPs into the transcripts, which cause frameshifts or early stop codons. This
discord between gene and message sequences from individual animals is a future area of investigation.
In addition to analyzing the diversity of the 185/333 gene
sequences, it is also of interest to understand those aspects
of the genes which are conserved. Element sequences are
conserved in that there are very few variations found in
single sequences, and each element has relatively few
unique sequences. Because there are so few unshared variations, each exon element (L – Ex25) consists of, on average, 11 unique sequences. Given the 121 unique total
gene sequences, this number is surprisingly low. Elements

BMC Molecular Biology 2007, 8:68

are commonly associated with one another, and element
patterns are largely defined by element Ex15 (or Er10)
subtypes, which are commonly associated with suites of
elements [30]. Furthermore, diversity data on the sets suggests that genes with identical element patterns tend to
have more similar nucleotide sequences. Perhaps genes
commonly share suites of elements due to their relative
proximity on the chromosome and frequent recombination. The genes may be arranged within the 185/333 locus
in smaller gene subfamilies, according to Ex15 subtype or
element pattern. Further sequencing and analysis of this
locus will be required to confirm this hypothesis.
On the whole, the intron sequences of the 185/333 gene
family are more diverse than the exon sequences, primarily as a result of an increased average number of variable
positions within the elements. This may be due to
decreased selective pressure to maintain this non-coding
sequence. Although diversity is present throughout the
intron sequence, small conserved regions exist that may
serve as transcription factor binding sites or regulatory
sequences. Preliminary evidence suggests that there may
be AP-1, dorsal and GATA binding sites within the intron
(unpublished data), all of which have been shown to
upregulate genes involved with immune functions [3436]. Although most of the exon element patterns are associated with a specific intron type, there are examples when
the two do not correlate. If the intron serves to regulate
gene expression or has some other regulatory function,
altering the intron type may affect the transcription of the
exon element pattern.
Using three animals in this study provided preliminary
insight into the population-level diversity of the 185/333
gene family. Among the 121 unique sequences isolated
from the three animals, no identical gene sequence was
shared among two or more animals. This diversity is also
illustrated from the 872 sequences (both messages and
genes) collected from 16 different animals that contain
477 unique open reading frames that form 51 exon element patterns and encode 323 unique protein sequences
[29,30]. The 14 new exon element patterns identified in
this study may represent genes that are not commonly
expressed, or genes that are not expressed in response to
challenge with marine bacteria, lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), or β-1,3-glucan; [29,30]).
Although the function of the 185/333 proteins is
unknown, the sequence diversity, size of the gene family,
and expression patterns all suggest a role in the defense
response of S. purpuratus. An immune-related function
would help explain this high level of inter-animal diversity, because in the arms race against pathogens, it is
important to maintain a polymorphic population of
immune-related genes within the host to allow survival in
the presence of new pathogens.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/68

Compared to other sea urchin genes, the 185/333 genes
are atypical. Among the 23,300 predicted gene models in
the sea urchin genome, the average gene has 8.3 exons and
spans 7.7 kb [37]. Furthermore, although the 185/333
intron is smaller than average (~400 bp compared to the
average size of 750 bp), the second exon length is significantly longer (average exon length is 100–115 nt) [37]. It
has been suggested that highly expressed genes are under
selection to maintain short introns, due to the cost of transcribing and splicing long introns [38]. Although the 185/
333 introns are not much shorter than average, in C. elegans, the difference in average intron length between
highly expressed genes and those expressed at low levels
was only 2-fold. At the extreme, histone genes, which are
highly expressed in replicating cells lack introns altogether
[39]. The 185/333 genes are strongly upregulated in
response to bacterial challenge, and represent ~65% of the
transcripts in immune activated coelomocytes [30]. This
high level of expression may be the selective pressure for
maintaining short intron sequences.
Locus structure
Analysis of the S. purpuratus genome assembly and
genomic DNA by PCR amplification indicates that the
185/333 gene locus consists of tandem arrays of closely
linked genes. Genomic DNA amplification using a variety
of primers suggests that genes are oriented head to tail,
head to head, and tail to tail (unpublished data). Given
the high sequence similarity (>88% identical), among the
genes and their close linkage, the several types of repeats
located within the genes, and the small repeats located
between the genes, each gene and its immediate flanking
region might be considered as a large repeat. The
sequences flanking the genes through the short repeat
regions are moderately conserved, and this conservation is
lost beyond the dinucleotide repeats (unpublished data).
Therefore, it is possible that the 185/333 genes are
arranged as cassettes defined on either side by dinucleotide repeats, which may facilitate diversification events,
such as meiotic mispairing, gene conversion, recombination, or duplication and/or deletion of intact genes with
the cis promoter. Dinucleotide repeats have been associated with genomic instability, which increases population
diversity [40] and recombination frequency [41].
Although dinucleotide repeats are also common in the S.
purpuratus genome (preliminary estimates of about
49,000 in the genome [33]), nothing is known about the
relative locations of repeats vs. open reading frames. The
putative 185/333 gene locus structure therefore appears to
be optimal for numerous diversification strategies as
would be predicted for genes that encode proteins with
important immune functions.

Conclusion
Analysis of the 185/333 gene family reveals that the diversity observed within the transcript repertoire is not the
result of alternative splicing, but rather, is encoded within
the second exon of the genes. These genes exhibit variability in both element patterns and sequence variations, and
preliminary data indicates that they encode a diverse family of proteins (unpublished). The repeats within and surrounding the genes, as well as their close linkage create a
locus that is optimal to promote diversification events
such as recombination and/or gene conversion. Therefore, the 185/333 gene family represents an example of
invertebrate innate immunity that is more complex than
previously believed. These results add to the growing body
of evidence suggesting that all organisms, including vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants maintain highly diverse
innate immune systems, and that diversification may be
driven by pathogen pressure.

Methods
Animals
Sea urchins were collected by Marinus Scientific, Inc.
(Long Beach, CA) by SCUBA divers from near-shore, subtidal regions off the coast of southern California and were
housed as previously described [17].
Genomic DNA isolation
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated from coelomocytes
collected from two sea urchins or from sperm from a single individual as previously described [30,42].
BAC library screens and BAC plasmid isolation
Filters from an arrayed BAC library were screened for 185/
333 positive clones using riboprobes. The library was constructed using the pBAC3.6 vector with insert sizes
between 50 and 60 kb [33]. Three cDNA clones [Sp0032
(DQ183167), Sp0164 (DQ183149), and Sp0313
(DQ183171)], with element patterns A1, D1, and C1,
respectively [27,30] were selected to synthesize a mixture
of riboprobes because they collectively contained all
known elements. Riboprobes were generated by incorporating 32P-rUTP and filters were screened according to
[43]. Positive clones were received from Eric Davidson
and Andrew Cameron at the California Institute of Technology.

Overnight cultures of BAC clones were grown in 2xYT
containing 12.5 µg/mL chloramphenicol. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 2 minutes at 12,500 × g and
resuspended in 300 µL buffer P1 (15 mM Tris, pH = 8; 10
mM EDTA; 100 µg/mL RNAseA). Buffer P2 (300 µL; 0.2 N
NaOH; 1% SDS), and buffer P3 (300 µL; 3 M potassium
acetate, pH = 5) were added, and the mixture was kept on
ice for 5 minutes. Samples were spun at 12,500 × g for 10
minutes at 4°C and the supernatants were precipitated by

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2199/8/68

the addition of an equal volume of isopropanol and resuspended in Tris-EDTA (TE; 10 mM Tris, pH = 8; 1 mM
EDTA).
Gene amplification, intergenic PCR, and cloning
The template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was
either 100 ng of gDNA, 50 ng of BAC DNA, or 10 ng of a
cloned gene. Genes cloned from animals 2 and 10 were
amplified in PCR reactions consisting of 1 µM of each
primer (Table 1), 150 µM of each deoxynucleotide, 2 mM
MgCl2, and either 0.5 U Optimase DNA Polymerase
(Transgenomic, Inc.) or 0.5 U Ex Taq DNA Polymerase
(Takara Mirius Bio., Madison, WI) and 1X of the appropriate company-supplied buffer. Both amplifications used
the following program: 94°C for 3 minutes followed by
25 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 61°C for 30 seconds,
and 72°C for 1 minute, with a final extension of 72°C for
5 minutes and a 4°C hold. Full-length genes were amplified by PCR using the primer pair 185-3'UTR and 1855'UTR (Table 1). To analyze the 5' half of the cloned genes
(leader through Ex7) and to identify those without
introns, clones were amplified with primers 185-5'UTR
and 185-R6 (Table 1).

To amplify intergenic regions from BAC or gDNA, reactions consisted of 400 nM each primer (LR1 and F5; Table
1), 400 µM of each deoxynucleotide, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 1X
company supplied buffer (Takara Mirius Bio), and 0.5 U
Takara LA Taq (Takara Mirius Bio). The amplification program was: 94°C for 2 minutes followed by 25 cycles of
94°C for 20 seconds, and 61°C for 9 minutes, with a final
extension of 72°C for 10 minutes and a 4°C hold.
Amplified 185/333 genes were cloned into the pCR4TOPO vector using the Topo-TA Cloning Kit for Sequencing according to the manufacturer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA). Plasmid DNA was isolated using the Wizard Plus
Miniprep DNA Purification System (Promega, Madison,
WI). Gene sequences were submitted to Genbank with
accession numbers EF607618–EF607793.
Cycle sequencing
DNA sequencing was done using the GenomeLab Dye
Terminator Cycle Sequencing with Quick Start Kit according to the manufacturer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA)
and analyzed on a Beckman CEQ 8000 DNA sequencer
(Beckman Coulter).
Bioinformatics
Sequences were manually aligned using Bioedit [44].
PERL scripts were written to identify identical sequences
and to calculate diversity characteristics (Additional files
9, 10, 11, 12). Sequence diversity was calculated as in
[30]. Nonsynonymous/synonymous (dn/ds) ratios were
calculated using Phylogenetic Analysis by Maximum Like-

lihood (PAML) [32]. Neighbor-joining trees for PAML
were created using unique sequences with Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA), v. 3.1 [45]. Phylogenetic analysis of the intron was done using Phylip [46].
Maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony trees
were generated, and bootstrap values were determined
based on 500 replications.
