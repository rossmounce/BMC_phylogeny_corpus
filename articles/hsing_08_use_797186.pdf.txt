Abstract
Background: Protein-protein interactions mediate a wide range of cellular functions and
responses and have been studied rigorously through recent large-scale proteomics experiments
and bioinformatics analyses. One of the most important findings of those endeavours was the
observation that 'hub' proteins participate in significant numbers of protein interactions and play
critical roles in the organization and function of cellular protein interaction networks (PINs) [1,2].
It has also been demonstrated that such hub proteins may constitute an important pool of
attractive drug targets.
Thus, it is crucial to be able to identify hub proteins based not only on experimental data but also
by means of bioinformatics predictions.
Results: A hub protein classifier has been developed based on the available interaction data and
Gene Ontology (GO) annotations for proteins in the Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens genomes. In particular, by utilizing the machine learning
method of boosting trees we were able to create a predictive bioinformatics tool for the
identification of proteins that are likely to play the role of a hub in protein interaction networks.
Testing the developed hub classifier on external sets of experimental protein interaction data in
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 252 and Caenorhabditis elegans demonstrated
that our approach can predict hub proteins with a high degree of accuracy.
A practical application of the developed bioinformatics method has been illustrated by the effective
protein bait selection for large-scale pull-down experiments that aim to map complete proteinprotein interaction networks for several species.
Conclusion: The successful development of an accurate hub classifier demonstrated that highlyconnected proteins tend to share certain relevant functional properties reflected in their Gene
Ontology annotations. It is anticipated that the developed bioinformatics hub classifier will
represent a useful tool for the theoretical prediction of highly-interacting proteins, the study of
cellular network organizations, and the identification of prospective drug targets – even in those
organisms that currently lack large-scale protein interaction data.

Background
A broad range of cellular functions are mediated through
complex protein-protein interactions, which are commonly visualized as two-dimensional networks connecting thousands of proteins by their physical interactions.
Such a network perspective suggests that cellular effects
and functions of proteins can only be fully understood in
context with their interacting partners in a protein interaction network (PIN).
The study of PINs has been made possible through recent
advancements in high-throughput proteomics that have
detected protein-protein interactions on a genome-wide
scale and have generated large amounts of interaction
data for several species including Saccharomyces cerevisiae
[3-7], Escherichia coli [8], Drosophila melanogaster [9],
Caenorhabditis elegans [10], and Homo sapiens [11,12]. The
corresponding protein interaction networks have been
made publicly accessible through open access databases
such as IntAct [13] and DIP [14].
The accumulated protein interaction data have further
supported recent protein network analyses that demonstrated the scale-free organization of PINs, where the
majority of proteins have a low number of interactions in
the network, with a few highly-connected proteins (also
called hubs) having a significant number of interacting
partners [1,2]. Such inhomogeneous network topology
allows a PIN to be robust against random removal of protein nodes, but vulnerable to targeted removal of network
hubs [15]. In addition, previous studies have shown
defined relationships between the degree of connectivity
of proteins in PINs, their sequence conservation, and cellular essentiality properties [16,17]. Those studies indicated that highly-connected proteins (or hubs) represent
very attractive subjects for understanding cellular functions, identifying novel drug targets, and for use in the
rational design of large-scale pull-down experiments.
Although large-scale PINs have already been experimentally determined for several species (and thus represent
suitable training sets for hub-predicting bioinformatics
approaches), in general, protein interaction data are still
lacking for many organisms. Thus, several computational
approaches have been developed to predict protein-protein interactions utilizing existing bioinformatics data
such as gene proximity information [18,19], gene fusion
events [20,21], gene co-expression data [22-24], phylogenetic profiling [25], orthologous protein interactions [26]
and identification of interacting protein domains [27-30].
Several bioinformatics approaches have also been developed to identify hypothetical interactions between proteins based on their three-dimensional structures [31,32]
or by applying text-mining techniques [33,34]. Traditionally, such computational predictions have focused on the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/2/80

identification of pairwise protein-protein interactions
with varying degrees of accuracy [35]; however, none of
them have been explicitly focused on predicting hypothetical hub proteins.
At the same time, it is reasonable to hypothesize that hub
proteins should share certain common sequence or structural features that not only enable them to participate in
multitudes of protein interactions, but also can be utilized
for the theoretical identification of such hub proteins
without prior knowledge of the corresponding PINs.
Therefore, the goal of this study is to develop such a 'hub
predictor' (or classifier), capitalizing on experimental and
bioinformatics data available to date for proteins in several model organisms with already-determined PINs.
We have focused the construction of the hub classifier on
Gene Ontology (GO) data, which provide functional
annotations for individual proteins using an expert
knowledge base [36-38]. The advantage of applying GO
annotation to hub prediction lies in the readily available
information for proteins in hundreds of species. Importantly, the GO annotations have been shown to reflect certain properties that can mediate protein-protein
interactions [35], but the annotation itself does not rely
on the availability of corresponding experimental data.
Thus, the GO-based hub classifier should be suitable for
predicting highly-connected proteins, even in organisms
that lack protein interaction data.
Here we present the development of such a hub protein
classifier, trained on the existing GO and protein-protein
interaction data for Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens species. The
generated models were cross-validated and tested on two
external protein interaction data sets: Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 252 and Caenorhabditis elegans. The developed bioinformatics approach has not
only demonstrated an improved accuracy in identifying
highly-connected PIN nodes (as compared to homologyor protein domain-based predicting methods), but has
also shown an improved speed and a lower demand on
computational resources.
To illustrate a possible application of the developed tool,
we have used it for rationalizing a bait selection strategy
for a large-scale protein complex pull-down experiment.

Methods
Data acquisition
Protein-protein interaction data
Protein interaction data used for the training and testing
of the hub protein classifier were obtained from the IntAct
database [13] for the following species: Escherichia coli K
12 (taxonomy ID: 83333), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (taxon-

omy ID: 4932), Drosophila melanogaster (taxonomy ID:
7227), and Homo sapiens (taxonomy ID: 9606) (acquisition date: Sep. 25th, 2007). Two external validation data
sets were collected for protein interactions in MRSA252
(provided by the PREPARE project in Vancouver B.C. Canada [39]) and Caenorhabditis elegans (obtained from IntAct
database on Sep. 25th, 2007). Table 1 lists the total
number of proteins and their interactions of the four species in the training and testing, which have been combined into a single data set for the subsequent analyses.
Similar information on the external validation sets is
shown in Table 2.
Hub proteins were identified based on their numbers of
protein interactions and their percentile ranking relative
to other proteins in the same species. Proteins of the same
species were divided into different percentile groups,
sorted by the number of protein-protein interactions in a
decreasing order (ie. higher percentile proteins have more
interactions than lower percentile proteins). It is clear that
hub proteins have more interactions than non-hubs, but
currently there is no consensus on exactly how many
interactions a hub protein should have. Often, hubs are
defined arbitrarily to have at least certain number of interactions [40]. In our study, the hub selection criterion was
based on the position of a sharp turn (or inflection point)
on an accumulative protein interaction distribution plot
from each of the four species. As shown in Figure 1, the
protein interactions followed a power law distribution,
such that a sharp turn is visible around the 90th protein
percentile position on the interaction plots.
To achieve a consistent hub definition across the four
studied species, hub proteins were defined as above or
equal to the 90th percentiles of interactors; in other words,
the hubs represented the top 10 percent of highly-con-

nected interactors, and the non-hubs were consisted of the
bottom 90 percent of the proteins. Using this definition,
hub proteins were determined from each of the four PINs
individually. At the 90th protein percentile, E. coli hubs
have at least 20 protein interactions, S. cerevisiae hubs
have at least 33 protein interactions, D. melanogaster hubs
have at least 16 protein interactions, and H. sapiens hubs
have at least 13 interactions. The number of assigned hub
and non-hub classifications is shown in Table 1.
Figure 2 illustrates the subsequent steps involved in the
development of the hub protein classifiers and their corresponding bioinformatics analyses.
Gene Ontology (GO) data
Each protein obtained from the IntAct database was identified by a unique UniProt accession number, which enabled a fast collection of GO annotation data from the
Uniprot Retrieval System [37,41] (Uniprot protein data
obtained on Oct. 1st, 2007). The complete UniProt protein annotation pages were downloaded as flat texts,
which were then parsed by PERL scripts to extract the GO
annotations in the three categories: biological process,
molecular function, and cellular component. Because
each GO term could be assigned to a different level of the
annotation hierarchy, we established a fixed general GO
level that represented all of the specific GO terms of the
proteins in the study. This general GO annotation level
was determined based on the GO slim project, which provides a list of generic GO terms on which many bioinformatics analyses can be performed [42]. Importantly, the
GO slim generic terms provided a reasonable number of
protein 'predictors' for a machine learning method to
effectively operate. The tool 'map2slim' [43] was used to
map specific GO terms to the 'GO slim' generic terms (GO
annotation files were obtained from [44] on Oct. 17th,

cated an equal GO distribution between the training and
testing sets. It is also shown that the majority of the GO
terms were associated with less than 10% of the proteins
in a given data set.
We focused the machine-learning effort on hub classification by applying boosting trees, which is one of the best
methods for classifying complex data and providing interpretable results [45]. The training and testing of the hubpredicting classification trees were performed on 125 GO
terms as predictor variables by using the boosting tree
application as implemented in STATISTICA version 8
[46]. The input data were formatted as tables of binary
data, where each column represented a GO term variable
(1 = present, 0 = absent) and each row represented a sample protein.
Four classifiers were built (one for each of the four training sets) and compiled in the C++ language under Linux.
In addition to the four testing sets in the cross-validation
study, the best of the four hub classifiers has been validated on two external data sets, which were consisted of
experimentally-determined PINs in MRSA252 and C. elegans. The classifier predicted each protein in the data sets
as either a hub or a non-hub, and the classification statistics were calculated as the following:
Sensitivity = TP/(TP + FN)
Specificity = TN/(TN + FP)

Table 1 and 2 list the number of GO slim terms used to
annotate the proteins in each species and the number of
the proteins with or without a GO annotation term.

Accuracy = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN)
PPV (Positive Predictive Value) = TP/(TP + FP)

All protein interaction data and GO annotations were
stored in a local MySQL database for fast data searching
and reporting.
Hub protein classification by boosting trees
To train models that classify a protein as a hub or a nonhub, the protein interaction data from the four species
were combined into a single data set (90,164 interactions
involving 2,069 hubs and 19,715 non-hubs). A four-fold
cross-validation strategy was used in which four non-overlapping testing sets (25% of the total protein set), and
four training sets (75% of the total protein set) were utilized for building the hub classifiers. Each training and
testing set maintained the same hub to non-hub (1:9)
ratio. In addition, the proteins in the training sets have
maintained the same distribution of GO annotation terms
as the proteins in the testing sets. Figure 3 illustrates the
distribution of each of the 125 GO terms, represented by
the percentage of proteins with this term in the training
sets vs. the testing sets of the four cross-validation samples. A high correlation R2 values of 0.9981 ~0.9983 indi-

NPV (Negative Predictive Value) = TN/(TN + FN)
, where TP = True Positive, FP = False Positive, TN = True
Negative, and FN = False Negative.
A useful output feature of the boosting tree method is the
relative predictor importance, which measures the average
influence of a predictor variable on the prediction outcome over all of the trees [45]. The most important predictor is assigned a value of 100, and the other variables are
scaled accordingly.
Comparison of the hub classifiers with other existing
protein interaction prediction approaches
To further assess the performance of the hub classifier
against other existing approaches for predicting hub proteins, we applied three different types of bioinformatics
methods to construct hypothetical PINs in MRSA252,
where hub proteins were determined by the number of
predicted pairwise protein-protein interactions.

plot, the (x, y) coordinate of the sharp turn or the inflection point is shown.

Hypothetical PIN – pathway maps
The first type of hypothetical PIN represented the known
protein-protein interactions available for MRSA252. A
total of 513 protein interactions were manually extracted
from the pathway maps in the KEGG database [47]
(acquisition date: May 3rd, 2006).
Hypothetical PIN – orthologous interactions
The second type of PIN was constructed based on known
protein-protein interactions between orthologs from
three other species: Helicobacter pylori, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Escherichia coli. The experimental PIN in H.
pylori was obtained from the BIND database [48] (acquisition date: Aug. 11th, 2005). Two sources were used to
build the S. cerevisiae PIN: the BIND database (acquisition
date: Aug. 11th, 2005) and Gavin's study [6] (acquisition
date from the IntAct database [13]: Feb. 7th, 2006). We
extracted the E. coli PIN in Butland's study [8] from the
IntAct database [13] (acquisition date: Apr. 13th, 2006).

2656 protein sequences in MRSA252 were obtained from
the RefSeq databases at NCBI [49] (acquisition date: Feb.
4th, 2006). The orthologs of the interacting proteins from
each of the above species were identified in MRSA252 by
using the program InParanoid [50] (version 1.35). If a
pair of MRSA252 proteins whose orthologs interacted in
one of the three species, the pair was assigned as an interacting protein pair. A total of 3258 protein interactions
were predicted for this type of MRSA252 PIN reconstruction.
Hypothetical PIN – interacting domains
The third type of MRSA PIN was predicted based on protein domain-domain interactions. First, the presence of
Pfam domains [51] in each of the 2656 MRSA252 proteins was determined by scanning the Pfam domain profiles (version 19.0) with the program HMMER [52]
(version 2.3.2). Second, domain-domain interaction data
were acquired from two sources: InterDom [53] (version:

1.2) and iPfam [54] (version: 19.0). If a pair of MRSA252
proteins contained interacting domains according to one
of the two sources, the pair was assigned as an interacting
protein pair. A total of 11,608 protein interactions were
predicted based by this method.
Validating the prediction on an experimental MRSA252 PIN
The experimental MRSA252 PIN provided by the PREPARE project contained interaction data for 133 proteins
and was used as the external validation set for measuring
the prediction performance of the hub classifier and the
different types of hypothetical PINs.

We have compared the prediction results in two different
ways. In the first type of comparison, both the hub classifier and the combined hypothetical PINs classified the
133 MRSA proteins as hubs or non-hubs, while the same
133 proteins were also classified as hubs or non-hubs
based on the experimental results provided by PREPARE.
In the case of the hub classifier, hubs and non-hubs were
reported explicitly from the prediction program. In the
cases of hypothetical and experimental PINs, hubs were
defined as above or equal to the 90th percentile of proteins
ranked by the number of interactions (same criterion as
the hub classifier). The following classification statistics

were calculated: sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, PPV and
NPV.
In the second type of comparison, we compared ranked
lists of proteins based on their 'hub-likeness' property. In

the case of the hub classifier, the proteins were ranked
based on the differences between predicted hub probabilities and non-hub probabilities as computed by the boosting tree method. In the case of the hypothetical and
experimental PINs, the proteins were ranked by their

numbers of protein interactions. The ranked lists were
compared to the list of proteins ranked by the number of
experimental interactions in MRSA252 by using a Spearman rank order correlation as implemented in STATISTICA 8.
Validating the prediction on an experimental C. elegans PIN
In addition to MRSA252, we have tested the hub protein
classifier on an external set of protein interaction data in
C. elegans. The same procedure was applied to determine
hub prediction statistics, as described above.
Test of significance
To test the hub protein classifier against a null hypothesis,
which claims there is no difference of GO term distribution between hubs and non-hubs, we have randomized
the protein interaction data in the following ways. Firstly,
the same 5445 proteins in the testing set (25% of the total
protein set consisted of the four species) for the hub classifier were used in the construction of a randomized data
set. Secondly, 10% of those proteins were randomly
assigned as hubs, while the other 90% of proteins were
randomly assigned as non-hubs. Thirdly, the GO terms
originally associated with those proteins were randomly
distributed within the data set. The combination of the
above two randomization methods ensured that there was
no significant difference in GO term distribution between
the hub and non-hub proteins. Finally, the hub classifier
was used to predict hubs and non-hubs in the randomized data set, and prediction statistics were obtained.
Simulation of protein bait selections and network coverage
The effectiveness of protein bait selections assisted by the
hub classifier has been simulated by using yeast proteinprotein interaction data determined by protein-complex

pull-down and mass spectrometry experiments, available
from Gavin's study [6]. One major goal of such large-scale
experiments is to maximize the number of protein interactions identified by using a small set of proteins as 'baits'
to pull down their interactors (preys). Therefore, it is crucial to select protein baits based on properties that will
produce the best network coverage, as measured by the
ratio between the number of protein interactions identified by an experiment and the total number of interactions in an organism.
In our simulation experiments, 18,028 interactions,
involving 2551 proteins from Gavin's yeast data set
(acquisition date from the IntAct database [13]: Feb. 7th,
2006), were hypothetically treated as the total number of
protein interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. To simulate the bait selection process, we selected a subset of proteins (ranged from 5% up to 100% of the 2551 yeast
proteins) as baits and calculated the number of interactions such baits would "pull-out" from the yeast interaction data set and computed the overall network coverage.
Two selection criteria were used. In one simulation, the
baits were randomly selected from the total pool of the
yeast proteins. In the other simulation, the baits were
selected from the pool of hub proteins predicted by the
hub classifier.
In addition to the bait selection strategy described above
(referred to as one-round selection), we simulated the network coverage results by applying a second round of selections. In this type of selection, baits were divided into two
sets: one-third as the first round of baits, and two-thirds as
the second round of baits. The first-round baits were chosen by either random selection or by hub prediction. The
second round of baits was selected from the most abun-

dant preys pulled down by the first round of baits. Such
an approach is also referred to as the "name your friend"
method and has been applied to maximize the effectiveness in vaccinations against infectious diseases [55,56], as
well as in some protein complex experiments [8].

Results and Discussion
Prediction performance of the hub prediction classifier
One prediction model was constructed for each of the
four cross-validation samples; therefore, a total of four

hub classifiers were generated. The executable files of the
classifiers were complied by the Gnu C++ compiler in
Linux. The classifier programs used a list of query proteins
and their corresponding GO term occurrences as the input
file, and produced the same list of the proteins with hub
prediction results and probability scores. The running
time was only a few seconds for predicting hubs from over
21,000 proteins on a 3.0 GHz Pentium D personal computer.

The prediction performance of the hub classifier was validated, based on the experimental PIN in C. elegans.

Overall, the classification statistics were consistent
between the training and testing sets for the four classifiers. Within the training sets, the sensitivity of the classifiers ranged from 33.33% ~36.51%, the specificity ranged
from 90.50% ~90.94%, and the accuracy ranged from
85.21% ~85.58%; PPV (positive predictive value) varied
from 27.40% ~29.12%, and NPV (Negative predictive
value) varied from 92.86% ~93.14%. Within the testing
sets, the sensitivity ranged from 25.87% ~30.89%, the
specificity ranged from 89.45% ~91.09%, and the accuracy ranged from 83.75% ~85.37%; PPV varied from
21.51% ~26.71% and NPV varied from 92.04% ~92.61%.
The classification statistics on the best of the four hub classifiers is shown in Table 3.
We have further validated the prediction accuracy of the
best hub classifier in the external MRSA252 data set. As
indicated in Table 4, in comparison to the other protein
prediction methods, the hub classifier has the highest prediction statistics, with 30.77% sensitivity, 90.83% specificity, 84.96% accuracy, 26.67% PPV and 92.37% NPV. The
next best hub prediction result was achieved by the hypothetical MRSA PIN based on orthologous interactions. On
the other hand, the results from the predicted PINs of
pathway maps and interacting domains were poor as
none of them had any true positives.
In the other comparison, we correlated a ranked list of
proteins based from their 'hub-likeness' (determined
from either the hub classifier or the hypothetical PINs) to
that of the experimental MRSA PIN. As shown in Table 5,
the hub classifier had a correlation coefficient of 0.32 –
highest among all other methods. The next best correlation was achieved by the hypothetical PIN of orthologous
interactions.

validation data set, with 32.97% sensitivity, 86.84% specificity, 81.70% accuracy, 20.92% PPV and 92.46% NPV,
as shown in Table 6.
The prediction statistics of the hub classifier on the randomized data set are summarized in Table 7. The result
shows that the hub classifier was not able to achieve a significant hub prediction when the GO terms and protein
hubs were randomly assigned. The prediction only
reached 11.43% sensitivity and 8.39% PPV in the randomized set, compared to 28.10% sensitivity and 22.00%
PPV in the testing set before the randomizations. The specificity and NPV were comparable before and after the
randomizations, due to the inherited 1:9 ratio between
the number of hubs and non-hubs. Therefore, it is easier
to make a correct prediction on non-hub proteins than
hub proteins. The comparison of the prediction results
between the testing set and the randomized set indicates
that hub proteins have a distinct distribution of GO terms,
which contributed to the predictability of the hub classifier.
Overall, the hub classifier built on the Gene Ontology
annotations achieved high specificity and NPV, but had
lower than expected sensitivity and PPV. We attribute this
to the lack of GO annotations for certain proteins in the
training sets, as the level of annotations varied among the
four species. For instance, S. cerevisiae had the highest percentage of the proteins with GO annotations (87.8%),
while only 48.2% of the proteins in E. coli had any GO
annotation. Therefore, the performance of the current hub
classifier primarily relied on the number of GO annotations available for each species. We expect the sensitivity
value of the hub classifier to be improved when more
annotation data become available for the four species in
the training sets.

In addition to MRSA252, the hub protein classifier has
achieved comparable prediction results in the C. elegans

GO term predictor importance
An indicator of the contribution of each GO term used in
the boosted trees classifiers was provided by the relative
importance of predictors in the training output. The importance value ranged from 0 to 100, where 100 indicated
that a predictor had the most influence on the hub prediction outcome, and 0 meant a predictor had the least influence. The top 20 GO annotation terms that were likely to
be shared among hub proteins are listed in Table 8.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/2/80

This classifier has improved accuracy for hub prediction
relative to other traditional approaches for protein interaction prediction. It is anticipated that the hub classifier
can serve as a useful tool to identify highly-interacting
proteins in species without any available protein interaction data, with potential applications in optimizing protein pull-down experiments and identifying new drug
targets against pathogens.

Availability
The top GO terms included several annotations such as
'RNA binding', 'translation', and 'ribosome', commonly
used to annotate ribosomal proteins, which were often
identified as the top interacting proteins in other experiments [6,8]. The list of important predictors indicated that
hub proteins tend to participate in several common cellular processes, including translation, nucleotide metabolism, organelle biogenesis, cell cycle, signal transduction,
cell death, and electron transport.
Applying hub classifier to protein bait selection
The bait selection strategy, assisted by the hub classifier,
was simulated in the experimental PIN of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae. In the case of one-round selection, choosing
baits that were predicted as hubs by the classifier has
greatly increased the network coverage in comparison to
random selection. For instance, as illustrated in Figure 4,
when 15% of total proteins were selected as baits based on
the result of the hub classifier, 42.39% of the network coverage was achieved. On the other hand, only 26.53% of
the network coverage was generated by the random bait
selection.

In the case of the two-round selection, the network coverage produced by either random or hub bait selection has
shown a great improvement from the one-round selection. The hub bait selection performed slightly better than
random in the two-round selection.
The results suggest that the hub classifier is a useful tool
for selecting baits and prioritizing proteins for protein
interaction experiments. Although it was not explored in
the present study, we expect that the hub classifier can also
assist in the identification of highly-interacting proteins in
pathogens as potential drug targets.

Conclusion
We have studied the available interaction and Gene
Ontology data for proteins in Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens
genomes. By utilizing the boosting trees classification
method, we have shown that highly-connected proteins
in the studied PINs share certain common GO terms; this
observation enabled the development of a hub classifier
capable of distinguishing hub proteins from non-hubs.
