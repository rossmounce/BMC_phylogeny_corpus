Abstract
Background: Puf proteins have important roles in controlling gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by
promoting RNA decay and repressing translation. The Pumilio homology domain (PUM-HD) is a conserved region
within Puf proteins that binds to RNA with sequence specificity. Although Puf proteins have been well
characterized in animal and fungal systems, little is known about the structural and functional characteristics of Puflike proteins in plants.
Results: The Arabidopsis and rice genomes code for 26 and 19 Puf-like proteins, respectively, each possessing
eight or fewer Puf repeats in their PUM-HD. Key amino acids in the PUM-HD of several of these proteins are
conserved with those of animal and fungal homologs, whereas other plant Puf proteins demonstrate extensive
variability in these amino acids. Three-dimensional modeling revealed that the predicted structure of this domain
in plant Puf proteins provides a suitable surface for binding RNA. Electrophoretic gel mobility shift experiments
showed that the Arabidopsis AtPum2 PUM-HD binds with high affinity to BoxB of the Drosophila Nanos Response
Element I (NRE1) RNA, whereas a point mutation in the core of the NRE1 resulted in a significant reduction in
binding affinity. Transient expression of several of the Arabidopsis Puf proteins as fluorescent protein fusions
revealed a dynamic, punctate cytoplasmic pattern of localization for most of these proteins. The presence of
predicted nuclear export signals and accumulation of AtPuf proteins in the nucleus after treatment of cells with
leptomycin B demonstrated that shuttling of these proteins between the cytosol and nucleus is common among
these proteins. In addition to the cytoplasmically enriched AtPum proteins, two AtPum proteins showed nuclear
targeting with enrichment in the nucleolus.
Conclusions: The Puf family of RNA-binding proteins in plants consists of a greater number of members than any
other model species studied to date. This, along with the amino acid variability observed within their PUM-HDs,
suggests that these proteins may be involved in a wide range of post-transcriptional regulatory events that are
important in providing plants with the ability to respond rapidly to changes in environmental conditions and
throughout development.

Background
Post-transcriptional control of gene expression functions
to regulate protein synthesis in a spatial and temporal
manner, and involves the activity of an extensive array
of RNA-binding proteins. Throughout the lifetime of an
mRNA, a dynamic association exists between mRNAs

and RNA-binding proteins. These interactions are
important in mediating mRNA maturation events such
as splicing, capping, polyadenylation and export from
the nucleus [1,2]. RNA-binding proteins also contribute
to post-transcriptional regulatory events in the cytoplasm, such as mRNA localization, mRNA stability and
decay, and translation. One group of RNA-binding proteins that are important regulators of cytoplasmic posttranscriptional control is the Puf family of proteins. Puf
proteins have extensive structural conservation within

their RNA binding domain and regulate a range of biological processes, including developmental patterning,
stem cell control, and neuron function [3].
The founding members of the Puf family of proteins
are Pumilio in Drosophila and fem-3 binding factor
(FBF) in C. elegans [4,5]. Puf protein diversity extends
across kingdoms, as mammalian, fungal, protozoan and
plant homologs have been identified [6-8]. The number
of Puf gene copies in each model organism is variable.
For example, the Drosophila, human, yeast, and C. elegans genomes encode one, two, six and eleven Puf
genes, respectively [9]. Puf proteins are generally known
to bind directly to sequence elements located within the
3’ untranslated region (UTR) of their target mRNAs.
Once bound, they interact with other proteins to inhibit
translation or trigger mRNA decay. For instance, Drosophila Pumilio represses the translation of hunchback
(hb) mRNA in early embryo development through deadenylation dependent and independent mechanisms [10].
Pumilio binds to a pair of 32 nucleotide Nanos
Response Elements (NRE1 and NRE2) located within
the 3’UTR of the hunchback mRNA. Each NRE contains
two core elements (Box A and Box B), each of which
interacts with one Pumilio protein in a cooperative
manner [11]. This interaction provides a platform for
the recruitment of Nanos (Nos) and Brain Tumor (Brat)
proteins to repress the translation of hunchback mRNA
in the posterior region of the embryo.
The RNA binding domain of Puf proteins (the Pumilio
Homology Domain, PUM-HD) forms a crescent-shaped
structure that usually contains eight imperfect tandem
Puf repeats each consisting of approximately 36 amino
acids [6,7]. Each Puf repeat is organized into three ahelices, the second of which provides a binding interface
with the target RNA. Within each Puf repeat, three conserved amino acid side chains are typically responsible
for modular binding of the repeat to a single RNA base
using hydrogen bonds, van der Waals, and base stacking
interactions [12]. Puf proteins often bind target transcripts that contain a conserved UGUR (where R represents a purine) tetranucleotide motif flanked
downstream by an AU-rich sequence of four nucleotides. The modular binding of each Puf repeat to an
RNA base is predictable based on the combination of
specific amino acids that contact the Watson-Crick edge
of the base [12-14]. This interaction, however, demonstrates considerable complexity and adaptability, as a
wide range of RNA sequences are recognized by each
Puf protein. For example, RNA-immunoprecipitation
profiling studies have shown that individual Puf proteins
can bind to hundreds of unique transcripts in vivo
[15-18]. This suggests that that this family of proteins
has important roles in regulating the stability and translation of numerous mRNA targets across a broad range

of organisms. These and other studies have shown that
Puf proteins can recognize RNA sequences that extend
beyond the canonical eight nucleotide length, and can
bind to non-cognate sequences [14,19-21]. The identification of mRNA targets of individual Puf proteins has
revealed that Puf proteins typically bind to subsets of
mRNAs that are functionally or cytotopically related and
located within macromolecular complexes. Thus, related
groups of mRNAs may be coordinately regulated as
‘post-transcriptional operons’ or ‘RNA regulons’
[15,16,22,23]. For example, yeast Puf3p binds to motifs
located in the 3’UTR of numerous mRNAs that encode
mitochondrial proteins and regulates the stability, transport and translation of these transcripts [24]. The RNA
regulon model predicts that environmental cues result
in a dynamic remodeling of RNP complexes to co-regulate mRNAs in a combinatorial manner to serve various
functional roles within the cell [22].
Plant Puf proteins have been described only briefly in
the literature, in the form of limited phylogenetic analyses [9,16,25,26], and recently with the identification of
putative mRNA targets of Arabidopsis Puf proteins [27].
Here, we discuss the evolutionary relationships of the
complete set of Puf proteins from the dicotyledonous
plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) and the monocotyledonous plant Oryza sativa (rice), as well as members from a moss and algal species. We also describe
three-dimensional structural modeling, and biochemical
and cellular characteristics of selected members of this
protein family. This work demonstrates that the plant
PUM-HD adopts the typical crescent shaped structure
that is characteristic of this domain in other organisms,
and that it possesses sequence specific RNA binding
activity in vitro. We provide evidence these plant Puf
proteins are packaged into common cytoplasmic particles that presumably have an evolutionary conserved
role in the post-transcriptional control of a vast array of
mRNA targets.

Results
Identification and comparative analysis of plant Puf
proteins

BLASTp and tBLASTn searches of the Arabidopsis and
rice genome databases were conducted using the Drosophila Pumilio PUM-HD amino acid sequence (residues
1093 to 1427) as the query sequence. This search
revealed that both the Arabidopsis and rice genomes
encode strikingly large Puf gene families that include 26
and 19 putative members, respectively. A phylogenetic
tree of the predicted Arabidopsis and rice Puf proteins
was constructed based on the deduced amino acid
sequence of their PUM-HD coding sequence (Figure 1).
Also included in the phylogenetic tree were representative Puf sequences from the moss Physcomitrella patens,

Figure 1 A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of the PUM-HDs of Arabidopsis, rice and other plant and non-plant species. The
analysis is based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the PUM-HD domain from each predicted Puf gene. The tree includes all members
from Arabidopsis and rice, and representative members from Physcomitrella patens (Phys), Chlamydomonas reinhardii (Chlamy), Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (Sc), as well as Drosophila Pumilio (DrPumilio) and human Pum1 (HsPum1). The Arabidopsis genes are referred by their designated
Pum gene number (i.e., AtPumxx) that were reported by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), as well as their gene locus
name (Atxxxxxxx). The rice clones are identified by their gene locus name only (Osxxxxxxxx), as standardized Pum gene designations have not
yet been established. Maximum likelihood bootstrap values (>65%) are shown above the nodes (PhyML/RaxML), and Bayesian posterior
probability values (>0.95) are shown below the nodes. The bar at the bottom of the figure indicates the number of substitutions per site. The
tree is rooted at its midpoint and, thus, its rooting should be interpreted as an hypothesis.

the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, and the
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as Drosophila
Pumilio and human Pum1.
The phylogentic tree identified several sub-families of
proteins that were assigned into groups based on monophyly (Figure 1). Group I was the most extensive of all
groups, and contained at least one Puf member from
each of the species that were included in this analysis.
This group corresponds to the ‘Pumilio cluster’ of proteins that was categorized previously [9]. Group II contained plant, algal, and yeast proteins, whereas Groups
III, IV, and V contained plant members only. A number
of proteins are more divergent, and do not appear to
belong to any of the major branches that were identified
in this analysis (Figure 1). Some Arabidopsis and rice
Puf genes appear to be orthologs (e.g., AtPum4 and
Os02g57390, and AtPum23 and Os10g25110) as they
demonstrate a high degree of sequence conservation in
the PUM-HD. Additionally, two Chlamydomonas proteins (XP001703567 and XP001693949) also appear to
be orthologs with plant Puf proteins. Gene expansion
through tandem duplication is also evident from this
analysis. AtPum 1, 2, and 3 (Group I) are clustered in
one region of chromosome 2, and other tandemly
located genes are also evident (i.e., AtPum 9 and 10,
AtPum 13 and 14, and AtPum 18 and 19).
Greater than half of the Arabidopsis (15/26) and rice
(13/19) Puf proteins possess eight imperfect tandem Puf
repeats (Figure 2). This is consistent with the number of
Puf repeats present in most non-plant Puf proteins,
although examples of functional Puf proteins with fewer
than eight repeats have been identified [15]. The
remaining Arabidopsis and rice Puf proteins lack one or
more of these repeats, with some possessing only two or
three obvious repeats. A number of core residues are
uniquely conserved within each of the eight PUF
repeats, thereby allowing us to determine the identity of
each repeat and whether a specific repeat is absent or
truncated. Crystallographic studies have demonstrated
that the eight tandem Puf repeats of the human PUMHD are flanked by two imperfect pseudorepeats (1’ and
8’) [7]. Regions resembling these pseudorepeats are
present in several of the Arabidopsis and rice proteins
(Figure 2). Puf proteins from other species often contain
large regions of low complexity [15]. Although isolated,
short regions of repeated amino acids are observed in
some Arabidopsis and rice Puf proteins, extensive
stretches of low complexity sequence are not observed
in these proteins. The tandemly positioned rice open
reading frames (ORFs), Os04g20774 and Os04g20800,
possess amino and carboxyl ends of the PUM-HD,
respectively (Figure 2). Analysis of the genomic DNA
region that separates the two sequences identified a
transposon that likely inserted within a full-length

Page 4 of 19

PUM-HD from the ancestral Puf protein. Interestingly,
there is cDNA support for Os04g20774, suggesting that
the encoded protein is functional. Although Os04g20774
and Os04g20800 are placed in different positions in the
phylogenetic tree (Figure 1), Os04g20774 likely belongs,
by association, with Os04g20800 in Group I. Placing
Os04g20774 in clade with AtPum25 is likely coincidental, as there is little conservation between these two
sequences.
Those Arabidopsis and rice genes that were not supported by cDNA sequences (Figure 2) were analyzed
more extensively in an attempt to validate their predicted ORFs. The presence of many closely related
members within each of the Arabidopsis and rice Puf
families allowed for sequence comparisons to provide a
more confident assignment of ORFs. Notably, the ORFs
of AtPum15 and AtPum17 that were listed in the database appear to have incorrectly predicted introns. In the
case of AtPum15, this resulted in the merger of an ORF
encoding a self-incompatibility protein with that of
AtPum15. An incorrectly predicted intron in AtPum17
was likely the result of a sequencing error. This predicted intron contained sequence that was almost identical to sequence within the ORF of the intronless gene
AtPum16, a close relative of AtPum17. Based on this
information, the primary structure line diagrams have
been modified, with the removal of the self-incompatibility ORF from AtPum15, and the intron from
AtPum17 (Figure 2).
The Arabidopsis PUM-HD with the highest amino
acid sequence similarity to the human Pum1 PUM-HD
is AtPum2, sharing 54% amino acid identity within this
domain. The rice Puf protein with the highest amino
acid sequence identity to AtPum2 is Os01g62650, possessing 49% amino acid identity throughout the entire
protein and 84% identity within the PUM-HD. The
AtPum2 and Os01g62650 PUM-HDs were included in
an amino acid sequence alignment with PUM-HDs from
other plant and non-plant species, and this alignment
demonstrated that extensive sequence conservation
exists in each of the Puf repeats (Figure 3). A comprehensive amino acid alignment of PUM-HDs comparing
the Arabidopsis and rice PUM-HDs with all of the
P. patens, C. reinhardtii, S. cerevisiae, human and Drosophila PUM-HDs demonstrated that the core of each
repeat has a high degree of amino acid conservation
across species (Additional file 1). The P. patens genome
contains 11 Puf-like genes, whereas four Puf-like genes
are present in the C. reinhardtii genome.
Crystallographic analysis of Puf proteins from other species has determined that the amino acids at positions
12, 13 and 16 within each Puf repeat provide the binding interface with RNA bases using hydrogen bonds, van
der Waals, or stacking interactions [13]. Surprisingly,

conserved nucleic acid binding protein domain (NABP) is present in several Arabidopsis and rice PUM-HDs (red). Three additional Puf repeats

alignment of these triplet amino acids in Puf repeats
from the Arabidopsis and rice PUM-HDs demonstrated
that there is complete conservation in some members
and extensive variability in others (Figure 4). The amino
acids at positions 12, 13 and 16 from AtPum1 through
AtPum6 are conserved with the corresponding triplets
in human Pum1 and Drosophila Pumilio (Figure 3, 4;
[6,12]). However, AtPum7 through AtPum12 possess a

single amino acid substitution in several of these amino
acid triplets, and AtPum13 through AtPum26 show
extensive variability and are less easily predictable (Figure 4). The rice PUM-HDs showed less variability in
these triplets, although uncommon triplet combinations
were also evident. In some Arabidopsis and rice PUMHDs, amino acid substitutions in one Puf repeat resulted
in a triplet composition that is identical to that observed

in a different Puf repeat (Figure 4). For instance, repeat
1 in several of the Arabidopsis and rice proteins possesses a cysteine at position 12 (CRQ), resulting in an
amino acid triplet that matches that of Puf repeats 3
and 5 in the conserved proteins. Interestingly, this CRQ
triplet is also found in repeat 1 in some fungal and protozoan Puf proteins [16]. Several examples of unconventional triplets are present in the Arabidopsis and rice
Puf repeats (Figure 4), some of which are present in Puf
repeats of other species as well (Additional file 1)
[16,28].
The regions of the Arabidopsis and rice Puf proteins
that lie outside of the PUM-HD are variable in primary
sequence and length (Figure 2, Additional file 2). These
variable sequences are typically amino-terminal extensions of each protein, although carboxyl-terminal extensions of variable length are also present in several
proteins. A Pfam search http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/ of the
polypeptide regions lying outside of the PUM-HD was
performed in an attempt to identify significantly conserved domains that are present within the variable

regions of the Arabidopsis and rice Puf proteins.
AtPum23 is the only Arabidopsis or rice Puf protein
that possesses Puf repeat sequences that reside outside
of the conserved PUM-HD region (Figure 2). Additionally, the amino-terminal region of several related Arabidopsis and rice proteins within Group I (Figure 1)
possess a motif that resembles a Nucleic Acid Binding
Protein domain (NABP, pfam07990; [29])(Figure 2).
Finally, the rice protein Os08g40830 possesses two
regions in its amino terminal extension that are similar
to versions of a ‘domain of unknown function’ (DUF,
pfam04782, pfam04783)(Figure 2), a region found in
some leucine zipper proteins [30].
To gain insight into the expression pattern of the Arabidopsis Puf genes in different tissues and in response to
various environmental stimuli, the transcription profiles
for these genes were extracted from the microarray
database [31,32]. Some overlap exists in the tissues/
organs that exhibit maximal expression between Arabidopsis Puf genes, particularly those genes that are closely related (Table 1). Each of the Puf genes showed a

significant change in expression pattern in response to
at least one abiotic or biotic stimulus. Extensive variability exists in the type of response to these stimuli, even
between genes that are closely related (Table 1).
Three-dimensional models of plant PUM-HDs

A homology modeling approach was used to gain
insight into whether plant PUM-HDs adopt the typical
crescent shaped three-dimensional structure similar to
that of the PUM-HDs from human, Drosophila and
yeast Puf proteins. The three-dimensional models of the
AtPum2 and Os01g62650 PUM-HDs bound to BoxB of
the hunchback mRNA NRE1 were constructed using the
crystal structure of the PUM-HD from human Pum1
bound to the NRE1 RNA (PDB: 1M8X; [12]) as a template for homology modeling. This structure was determined at 2.2 Å resolution and provides the most reliable
template currently available for modeling the nature of
protein:RNA interactions from plant PUM-HDs. Notably, only interactions between Puf repeats 2 to 8 and the
bound RNA could be modeled, since the RNA templates
for the complexes determined at high resolution only
included residues 1 to 9 of Box B from NRE1 (PDB:
1M8X and 1M8W; [12]).

Page 8 of 19

The homology models of the AtPum2 and
Os01g62650 PUM-HD bound to the NRE1 indicate
that plant PUM-HDs can form interactions with RNA
in a manner similar to that observed in the human
PUM-HD:RNA complexes (Figure 5A, B, Additional file
3; [12]). The conserved amino acid triplets at position
12, 13, and 16 of each repeat in AtPum2 and
Os01g62650 (Figure 4, Figure 5C, D) form interactions
with RNA bases in the modeled structure (Figure 5A,
B, E, F). Most of the hydrogen bonds and van der
Waals contacts formed by amino acids at positions 12
and 16 in the human PUM-HD:RNA crystal structures
[12] are also observed in the models of the plant PUMHD:RNA complexes (Figure 5E, F). The stacking interactions between residues at position 13 and adjacent
bases are also conserved. In addition to similarities in
the structures of the Puf repeats, the homology models
also indicate that a region lying between the seventh
and eighth Puf repeats can form an extended loop
structure on the convex surface of the domain (Figure
5A, B), similar to that observed in the human and Drosophila PUM-HD proteins. In Drosophila, this loop
interacts with the translational co-repressors Nos and
Brat [6,33].

A similar approach was used to model the structure of
the PUM-HD of AtPum13, a Puf protein that varies significantly in the identity of Puf repeat amino acid residues at positions 12, 13 and 16 (Figure 4). The
homology model for the AtPum13 PUM-HD:RNA complex indicates that interactions between Puf repeats 6, 7
and 8 with the highly conserved UGU sequence at the
centre of Box B are conserved in AtPum2 and
Os01g62650 (compare Figure 5 with Figure 6). However,
the model also shows that the remaining AtPum13 Puf
repeats fail to form many of the stacking interactions
and hydrogen bond interactions that are observed in
AtPum2 and Os01g62650. As a result, we predict that
the binding affinity of AtPum13 for the NRE1 is lower
than that of AtPum2, and AtPum13 may prefer RNA
targets that are different from the NRE1 outside of the
UGU core. It is also interesting to note that the
AtPum13 model reveals the presence of extended loops
on the convex surface of the protein between Puf
repeats 2 and 3, as well as repeats 3 and 4 (Figure 6).
AtPum2 PUM-HD binds with specificity to the
hunchback NRE1

To determine if the AtPum2 PUM-HD binds RNA as is
predicted by structural modeling, electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed. Two synthetic
19-nucleotide RNAs were used in these assays. The first
was a wildtype Nanos Response Element (wildtype
NRE1) that matched a region from BoxB of the hunchback NRE1 (Figure 7A). This RNA oligonucleotide
(wildtype NRE1) was identical in sequence to one used
in a previous study that analyzed the binding affinity of
the human PUM-HD to RNA [14]. The second RNA
oligonucleotide was a variant form of the NRE1 (mutant
NRE1) that contained a single nucleotide change in the
highly conserved core of the Puf repeat binding site
(UGU to UUU). This mutant NRE1 was shown to have
approximately 100-fold reduced affinity for the human
PUM-HD [14]. The EMSA experiments demonstrated
that the AtPum2 PUM-HD bound effectively to the
wildtype NRE1, whereas binding to the mutant NRE1
was significantly lower (Figure 7A). Competition assays
were performed to further demonstrate the specificity of
the AtPUM2 PUM-HD interaction with wildtype NRE1.
The addition of 100-fold excess concentration of cold
mutant NRE1 competitor to the assay mixture only
slightly reduced the binding of wildtype NRE1 to the
AtPum2 Pum-HD, whereas the addition of excess cold
wildtype NRE1 competitor completely eliminated any
detectable interaction between the protein and the
mutant NRE1 (Figure 7A).
EMSA titration experiments were conducted to determine the binding affinity of the AtPum2 PUM-HD to
the wildtype and mutant NRE1. The AtPum2 PUM-HD

GST or GST-AtPum2 PUM-HD (PUM). Unbound radiolabelled RNA (Free) shifts to a high molecular weight complex when bound to GST-AtPum2
PUM-HD (Bound). The fraction of bound RNA (Bf) was determined for each reaction. 100-fold excess non-labelled mutant NRE1 was added to the
reaction containing labelled WT-NRE (NRE + comp). Conversely, 100-fold excess of non-labelled wildtype NRE1 was added to the reaction
containing labelled mutant NRE RNA (G to U + comp). The underlined RNA sequence corresponds to cognate RNA that interacts with repeats 1
through 8 in the Drosophila Pumilio PUM-HD. (B) EMSA titration of WT-NRE1 and increasing concentrations of GST-AtPum2 PUM-HD (PUM-HD).
The protein concentrations were 0, 0.12, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.9, 7.8, 15.6, 31.3, 62.5, 125 and 250 nM. (C) The fraction of bound WT-RNA as a

bound to wildtype NRE with an apparent dissociation
constant of 10.6 nM (Figure 7B, 7C). This value is >10fold higher than was observed for Drosophila Pumilio
PUM-HD binding to the NRE1 (Kd ~0.5 nM; [34]), but
within the range observed for other Puf protein interactions with their cognate RNAs [21,28]. The binding affinity of the protein to the mutant NRE1 was significantly
lower than to wildtype RNA (Figure 7D). Although a protein-mutant NRE1 complex was apparent at an AtPum2
PUM-HD concentration of 62.5 nM, the interaction
remained weak at a protein concentration of 2000 nM, as
seen by the diffuse nature of the shifted band. However,
only a small amount of free RNA was present in the 1000

nM and 2000 nM samples, indicating that the low affinity
binding of the AtPum-HD to the RNA resulted in a dissociation of the complex during electrophoresis. Thus,
the instability of the complex did not allow for an accurate determination of the dissociation constant. However,
based on the amount of free RNA in each lane, the dissociation constant value for the protein bound to mutant
NRE1 appears in the range of 250 to 500 nM.
Arabidopsis Puf proteins typically localize to dynamic,
punctate cytoplasmic structures

To provide insight into the subcellular localization patterns of the Arabidopsis Puf proteins, several of these

Tam et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/44

proteins were transiently expressed as fusions to the
amino-terminus of either GFP or RFP in onion or fava
bean epidermal cells. In total, nine AtPum proteins were
successfully expressed as fluorescent protein fusions.
Seven of the fusion proteins localized to cytoplasmic
structures that were visible as puncta 0.5 microns or
less in diameter (Figure 8A to 8G). However, large protein aggregates were occasionally observed in some cells,

Page 12 of 19

likely resulting from higher levels of expression of the
fusion protein (Figure 8B). In epidermal cells that
demonstrated active cytoplasmic streaming, the fluorescent particles were occasionally dynamic, demonstrating
stop-and-go movements that reached peak velocities of
up to five microns/second (Additional file 4). Particle
movement ceased when cells were treated with the actin
destabilizing agent, latrunculin B (Additional file 5),

indicating that the actin cytoskeleton was responsible for
driving particle movement. The microtubule disrupting
agent, oryzalin, did not noticeably affect the movement
of the AtPum containing particles (data not shown). In
addition to punctate cytoplasmic staining, strong nuclear
fluorescence was often observed, and was more prevalent in cells expressing specific fluorescent protein
fusions (e.g. Figure 8E and 8F). This observation suggested that some fusion proteins shuttle between the
nucleus and cytoplasm. Nuclear localization and export
may be common features for most of the AtPum proteins, as 24 out of the 26 proteins have a predicted leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) http://www.cbs.
dtu.dk/services/NetNES/, with AtPum1 and AtPum4 as
exceptions. The predicted NES sequences are located in
the variable amino terminal region of each protein,
which in several AtPum proteins is extremely short (Figure 2). NES-containing proteins are dependent on
CRM1 (exportin 1) for export from the nucleus [35],
and are sensitive to export inhibition by leptomycin B.
Epidermal cells expressing each of the cytoplasmic,
punctate AtPum fluorescent protein fusions shown in
Figures 9A through 9G were treated with leptomycin B.
We observed that all but one fusion protein (AtPum10GFP) demonstrated an accumulation of fluorescent signal in the nucleus after treatment with leptomycin B
(Figure 9, data not shown). This indicated that AtPum
proteins shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus
via a CRM-1 mediated pathway.
Two AtPum-fluorescent fusion proteins (AtPum23-GFP
and AtPum24-GFP) had a different subcellular localization pattern from the others, demonstrating only nuclear
fluorescence that was enriched within nucleolar-like
structures (Figure 8H, I). Co-expression of AtPum23GFP and AtPum24-GFP with a nucleolar targeted marker protein (RFP-PRH75; [36]) confirmed that these
structures were indeed nucleoli (Figure 10). Interestingly, AtPum23 and AtPum24 are the only Arabidopsis

Page 13 of 19

Puf proteins with long polypeptide extensions at the carboxyl-terminal end of the PUM-HD. Nucleolar localization signals are not easily predictable; however, these
signals are often enriched in the basic amino acids lysine
and arginine, two amino acids that are well represented
in the carboxyl-terminal regions of AtPum23 and
AtPum24. These two proteins have predicted nuclear
localization signals (NLS; Predict NLS, http://www.predictprotein.org/cgi/var/nair/resonline.pl). AtPum23 possesses a predicted NLS at position 688 near the
carboxyl-terminal end of the protein, and AtPum24 has
two predicted NLS sequences near the amino-terminal
end (positions 77 and 98).
To determine whether the various AtPum proteins
were segregated into distinct cytoplasmic particles, several pairs of AtPum-fluorescent protein fusions
(AtPum7-GFP:AtPum18-RFP, AtPum9-GFP:AtPum18RFP, AtPum12-GFP:AtPum18-RFP, AtPum14-GFP:
AtPum18-RFP, AtPum10-GFP:AtPum8-RFP) were coexpressed in epidermal cells. Each pair of co-expressed
AtPum fusion proteins co-localized within the same
cytoplasmic particles (data not shown). However, there
was a frequent concentration bias of either GFP or RFP
fluorescence in co-localizing particles, indicating that
AtPum proteins were not necessarily represented in
equimolar concentrations within each particle.

Discussion
The Arabidopsis and rice Puf gene families are extensive, consisting of a greater number of members than
any other model species studied to date [9]. Considering
the size of the Arabidopsis and rice genomes (Arabidopsis, 125 Mb, 26751 genes; rice, 389 Mb, 42,000 genes;
[37-39]), Puf genes are over-represented in the plant
genome when compared to other species. Whole genome duplications may have contributed to the large
number of plant Puf genes. The ancestral Arabidopsis
genome was duplicated three times in the past 150-200

million years [40], and the rice genome, along with that
of other monocots, has probably experienced at least
one duplication event [41]. In addition to whole-genome
duplications, Puf gene expansion likely increased as a
result of single gene duplications in both Arabidopsis
and rice, as demonstrated by the presence of tandem
gene copies (Figure 1). The presence of plant, algal and
yeast sequences in the two main branches of the phylogenetic tree (Groups I and II, Figure 1) indicates that
the PUM-HD of these proteins has remained relatively
conserved in these species. Branches containing Arabidopsis sequences only (Groups III and IV) suggests that
independent radiation of Puf proteins has occurred in
this species, in a similar fashion to a large group of Puf
proteins in Caenorhabditis elegans [9]. The maintenance
of duplicated plant Puf genes may be related to the sessile lifestyle of plants and their ability to adapt to challenging environmental conditions. If plant Puf proteins
function in mRNA decay and translational repression as
they do in other organisms, they could function to regulate the stability or translation of their target mRNAs in
response to environmental stimuli in a rapid and coordinated manner. Indeed, microarray profiling revealed
extensive changes in AtPum transcript expression patterns in response to various external stimuli (Table 1).

Homology modeling of AtPum2, AtPum13 and
Os01g62650 PUM-HDs predicted that these domains
adopt the characteristic crescent shaped structure that is
common to PUM-HDs (Figure 5, 6). The identity of the
amino acids at positions 12, 13 and 16 in each of the
AtPum2 and Os01g62650 Puf repeats are identical to
those in the Drosophila Pumilio and human Pum1 proteins, and provide conserved interactions with their corresponding RNA bases in the NRE1 sequence (Figure 5;
[6,12]). The predicted interaction between the AtPum2
PUM-HD and the NRE1 was confirmed by EMSA assays
(Figure 7). The UGU core target sequence appears
necessary for binding the AtPum2 PUM-HD, as demonstrated by the reduced affinity of AtPum2 to an NRE
that contained a point mutation in this core sequence
(Figure 7). This result is consistent with a recent study
that utilized a three-hybrid assay to determine binding
interactions [27]. The predictable association between
amino acids within each Puf repeat and their bound
nucleotide was revealed previously for human Pum1,
where substitution of specific amino acid side chains
demonstrated that an RNA recognition code exists for
this protein [13,14]. However, Puf proteins appear able
to interact with RNA binding sites that vary substantially in sequence outside of their UGU core. For

Tam et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/44

instance, human Pum1 binds hundreds of mRNA targets
in vivo [17,18], as do Puf proteins from Drosophila, C.
elegans and yeast [15,16,28,42]. These subsets of
mRNAs are typically related in function or in their subcellular localization pattern [15,16,18,24]. In addition to
binding to RNA targets with sequence variability, the
PUM-HD of several Puf proteins can accommodate
binding targets that are greater than eight nucleotides in
length by flipping out spacer nucleotides [19-21,43]. Evidence is emerging that individual plant Puf proteins also
bind to a range of mRNA targets [27].
Many of the plant Puf proteins have considerable
variability in the amino acids at position 12, 13 and 16
in their PUM-HD that are predicted to be involved in
molecular interactions with RNA bases (Figure 4, Additional file 1). Several of these variable triplet amino
acids are found in Puf proteins identified in other
organisms [16,28], however, many are unique to plants.
Should these variable Puf proteins indeed possess RNA
binding activity, the amino acid sequence variability
could provide another level of specificity for Puf mRNA
targets in plant cells. The triplet amino acids in the Puf
repeats of AtPum13 differ from those in AtPum2 in six
of the eight Puf repeats (Figure 4), and modeling of
AtPum13 indicated that the NRE1 is not an ideal target
for this protein, based on the predicted absence of
stacking interactions (Figure 6). The observation that
several of the Arabidopsis and rice proteins have fewer
than 8 recognizable Puf repeats might also provide a
mechanism for variable RNA target specificity. Yeast Puf
proteins that possess only six Puf repeats function as
RNA-binding proteins that function in post-transcriptional control of gene expression [8,15]. Whether the
plant Puf proteins that possess only two, three or four
repeats are bona fide RNA-binding proteins or function
in some other cellular capacity, remains to be determined. It is possible that one or more of these proteins
are encoded by pseudogenes and are not functional.
However, transcriptional array data indicates that these
genes are actively transcribed in Arabidopsis (Table 1),
providing support for their expression and activity.
Additional regions that were identified within Puf proteins could play a role in determining RNA target specificity. A histidine side chain in Puf repeat 8’ from human
PUM1 is involved in stacking interactions with the uracil
base bound to Puf repeat 8 [12]. Repeat 8’ is present in
most plant PUM-HDs (Figure 2), and the modeled
AtPum2 structure indicates that this conserved histidine
does indeed provide a stacking interaction with the corresponding RNA base (Figure 5). The NABP domain
located in the amino terminal region of several Arabidopsis and rice Puf proteins, and the additional Puf repeats in
the AtPum23 amino terminal region (Figure 2), could
also enhance specificity of RNA targets by binding to

Page 15 of 19

regions of the transcript that lie outside of the PUM-HD
binding site. The recruitment of other factors might also
enhance the RNA binding specificity of the Pum-HD.
The convex surface of repeats 7, 8 and 8’ in the Drosophila PUM-HD interacts with its co-factors Nanos and
Brat, and this interaction involves an extended loop that
lies between repeats 7 and 8 [6,33]. A conserved extended
loop in the AtPum2 PUM-HD indicates that a similar
interaction might also occur (Figure 5), although homologs of Nanos and Brat have not been identified in plants.
Interestingly, the model of the AtPum13 PUM-HD structure reveals potential loops between Puf repeats 2 and 3,
and repeats 3 and 4 (Figure 6). These loops also present
potential binding surfaces for regulatory proteins.
Most of the AtPuf proteins that were expressed in epidermal cells as fluorescent protein fusions were localized
to dynamic, punctate structures in the cytoplasm (Figure
8). The prevalence of predicted NES sequences in these
proteins, and the observed nuclear accumulation of many
of these after treatment with LMB indicates that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is a common feature of these proteins. The enrichment of AtPum23 and AtPum24
fluorescent protein fusions within nucleoli provides
another association of Puf proteins with the nucleus (Figure 8H, 8I). Nucleoli are traditionally known to be
involved in the transcription and processing of ribosomal
RNA and ribosome subunit biogenesis, and in the assembly of RNPs [44]. More recently, the discovery that
numerous mRNAs, the exon-junction complex of proteins, RNA-binding proteins, and other proteins localize
to nucleoli in plant cells supports a role for the nucleolus
in mRNA processing, silencing, surveillance and export
[44,45]. Additionally, a search of the human nucleolar
database http://www.lamondlab.com/NOPdb3.0/ identified a human Pumilio-domain containing protein. As
well, yeast Puf6p, an Ash1 mRNA-binding protein, is a
nuclear shuttling protein that is enriched in the nucleolus
[46,47], as is mammalian Staufen, another protein
involved in cytoplasmic mRNA localization [48]. Thus,
the nuclear associations of AtPum proteins suggest that
these proteins are components of a preassembly complex
that is involved in RNA decay, translational control or
cytoplasmic transport of specific groups of mRNAs.

Conclusions
The Puf family of RNA-binding proteins in Arabidopsis
and rice contain a greater number of members than in
any other model species studied thus far. The modeled
three-dimensional structure of three plant PUM-HDs is
conserved, however, the identity of the amino acids that
are predicted to contact RNA bases demonstrates considerable variability throughout this family of proteins.
EMSA and subcellular localization studies indicate that
these proteins are nucleocytoplasmic shuttling proteins

Tam et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:44
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/44

that bind to RNA in a sequence specific manner. The
large number of plant Puf protein family members suggests that these proteins are key in regulating the stability and translation of a significant number of mRNAs
in the cell. Important future studies include the identification of target mRNAs for individual plant Puf proteins, determination of co-crystal structures of divergent
Puf proteins with their cognate RNAs, and identification
of the components of Puf protein-containing particles.

Methods
Bioinformatic analysis of plant Puf genes

Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analyses
were performed to identify Arabidopsis and rice genes
that encode regions of the conserved PUM-HD. The
amino acid sequence of the Drosophila PUM-HD (residues 1093 to 1427) [6] was queried against Arabidopsis
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/seq/BlastGen/
BlastGen.cgi?taxid=3702; http://rarge.gsc.riken.jp/;
http://www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/osa1/) rice http://rice.
plantbiology.msu.edu/index.shtml, moss (Physcomitrella
patens, http://www.cosmoss.org/), and Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii http://www.chlamy.org/ sequence databases
using BLASTp and tBLASTn programs.
Multiple sequence alignments of Arabidopsis and rice
PUM-HDs were generated using ClustalX, and then
manually refined in BioEdit (version 5.0.9; [49]). Ambiguously aligned sites were removed from the alignment,
leaving 341 amino acids that were used in the phylogenetic analysis. Three types of analyses were performed;
Bayesian inference, and two methods in the maximum
likelihood framework (PhyML, RAxML). The Bayesian
analysis was performed using MrBayes (v3.1.2) for
20,000,000 generations with trees sampled every 1000
generations [50,51]. The mixed model approach was
implemented with MrBayes. This allowed new models to
be proposed in the course of the analysis, with multiple
models potentially contributing to the posterior distribution of trees. Maximum likelihood trees were estimated
using the programs PhyML [52] and RAxML [53]. Model
selection was guided by the Akaike Information Criterion
as implemented in ProtTest [54]. In addition, 500 bootstrap replicates were performed using both PhyML and
RAxML to assess statistical significance of the groups.
Transcript expression profiles are based on microarray
data available from the public databases Genevestigator
[31] and The Bio-Array Resource for Plant Functional
Genomics (BAR) [32].
Homology models

The sequences of the PUM-HD from AtPum2
(At2g29190, amino acids 616-952), AtPum13 (At5g43090,
amino acids 252 to 527), and Os01g62650 (amino acids
707-1043) were aligned against the sequence of the PUM-

Page 16 of 19

HD from human PUM1 (Hs.281707, amino acids 8281178, Protein database ID: 1M8X). Homology models
were generated by Modeller 9v2 [55] using as a template
the crystal structure of the PUM-HD from human Pum1
in a complex with a 14-mer RNA sequence from the
NRE1-14 of the Drosophila hunchback mRNA (PDB code
1M8X, [12]. The homology models were refined with CNS
1.1 [56] and the quality of geometric parameters was
assessed with PROCHECK [57]. All backbone torsion
angles were within allowed regions of the Ramachandran
plot, and more than 90% of the residues were in the energetically most favored regions. Figures were prepared
using PyMOL software (DeLano Scientific).
Molecular cloning

PCR was used to amplify the coding regions of several
Arabidopsis Puf genes. Full-length complimentary
(cDNA) or genomic DNA was used as a template for
PCR. Full-length cDNA clones were obtained from
RIKEN and the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center
(ABRC). For recombinant protein expression, the coding
region of repeats 1’ through 8’ of the AtPum2 PUM-HD
(amino acids 614 to 963) was amplified by PCR using
oligonucleotide primers 5’CGAGGAGGATCCTTTGGATCTTCAATGCTTGAAG3’ and 5’CGAGGAGGATCCGGCCATGTTGTAGAGTTCAGTTC3’. The
PCR product was cloned into the BamHI and SalI sites
of pGEX-6P-1 (GE Healthcare).
Construction of expression vectors for AtPum subcellular localization analysis was performed using recombination or ligation based cloning of full-length AtPum coding
regions into various expression vectors. Oligonucleotide
primers were designed to encode the full-length AtPum
protein. The PCR primers used were: AAGATGGATGAGTTTCGTGAAG and CTTCTTCAATAGATTCC
TCGAGAAA (AtPum7); CACCATGATGAGAGGTGAA
TTTGG and ATTCTTCAAGAGATTTCGTG (AtPum8);

CTCATTTTATTTGAATGCCGA (AtPum23); CACCA
TGTCTTCCAAAGGTCTGAAACCTC and TTCAGG
TTTCTTGGTTGCTGAGATC (AtPum24). For recombination cloning, PCR amplified products were inserted into
the pDONR221 or pENTR/D-TOPO Gateway entry vectors (Invitrogen), which were then recombined with
pB7FWG2 or p2GWF7 GFP fusion destination vectors

(Functional Genomics Unit, Department of Plant Systems
Biology, VIB-Ghent University). Ligation cloning of PCR
products into the BglII and XbaI sites of pRTL2ΔNS/RFP
[58] was performed for RFP fusion constructs. The expression vectors used the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S
promoter to drive transcription, and either the 35S or
nopaline synthase terminator sequences. The nucleotide
sequence was confirmed in each expression construct by
standard sequencing techniques (Quintara Biosciences,
Berkeley, CA)
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA)

The AtPum2 PUM-HD coding sequence in pGEX-6P-1
was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) as a fusion to
the carboxyl-terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST).
Bacterial cultures were grown overnight at 37°C, diluted
1 in 100 in fresh media and grown at 37°C to an OD600
value of 0.6. IPTG (0.2 mM) was added and the cultures
were incubated at 37°C for 3 hours. The recombinant
protein was purified using a glutathione affinity matrix
(Stratagene), and reconstituted in binding buffer (10 mM
HEPES pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT,
0.01% BSA, 0.01% Tween 20). Synthetic RNAs (Dharmacon) were radiolabelled using 32P-g-ATP (3000 Ci/mmol,
Perkin Elmer) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Fermentas).
Labelled RNAs were purified from free nucleotides by gel
filtration chromatography (NucTrap, Stratagene). Binding reactions (30 μL volume in binding buffer) contained
200 pM of labelled RNA and varying concentrations of
protein, with or without cold competitor RNA. Reactions
were incubated at room temperature for one hour, and
run on a 6% non-denaturing acrylamide gel (Mini Protean II, BioRad) at 100 V for 45 minutes at 4°C. Gels
were dried, exposed to a storage phosphor screen for 612 hours, and the screens scanned using a phosphorimager (Molecular Imager FX, BioRad). Densitometry was
performed using Quantity One software (version 4.5.1,
BioRad), and the data was analyzed using Prism 3 software (GraphPad). To determine the fraction of protein
that was bound to RNA (fraction bound, Bf), the relative
pixel intensity in the bound complex band was divided
by the sum of the pixel intensities in the bound complex
band plus the free RNA band.
Transient expression in leaf epidermal cells and
microscopic analysis

GFP and RFP fusions proteins were expressed in fava bean
(Vicia faba) and onion (Allium cepa) epidermal cells layers
using the particle bombardment technique (PDS-1000,
BioRad) [59]. After bombardment, leaves were incubated
overnight in the dark. Epidermal cell layers were peeled
from the leaves, mounted on microscope slides in distilled
water, and covered with a coverglass. For drug treatments,
onion epidermal cell layers were floated on a Murashige

Page 17 of 19

and Skoog (MS) medium containing either leptomycin B
(190 ng/mL, Sigma) and latrunculin B (1 nM, BIOMOL
International). Negative control peels were floated on MS
medium containing an appropriate volume of the drug
solvent only. Epidermal cell layers were observed through
FITC or rhodamine filter sets using a Plan Fluotar 40x
objective lens or a Plan Apo 63x oil immersion objective
lens attached to an epifluorescence microscope (DMR,
Leica). Images were captured using a cooled CCD camera
(Retiga 1350 EX; QImaging). Velocity software (Version
4.3.1, Improvision) was used for capturing images and
image series compilation. Adobe Photoshop software (Version 8.0, Adobe Systems Inc.) was used for image modification and assembly.
