Abstract
Background: We have recently identified two large families of extinct transposable elements
termed Short Interspersed DEgenerated Retroposons (SIDERs) in the parasitic protozoan
Leishmania major. The characterization of SIDER elements was limited to the SIDER2 subfamily,
although members of both subfamilies have been shown to play a role in the regulation of gene
expression at the post-transcriptional level. Apparent functional domestication of SIDERs
prompted further investigation of their characterization, dissemination and evolution throughout
the Leishmania genus, with particular attention to the disregarded SIDER1 subfamily.
Results: Using optimized statistical profiles of both SIDER1 and SIDER2 subgroups, we report the
first automated and highly sensitive annotation of SIDERs in the genomes of L. infantum, L. braziliensis
and L. major. SIDER annotations were combined to in-silico mRNA extremity predictions to
generate a detailed distribution map of the repeat family, hence uncovering an enrichment of
antisense-oriented SIDER repeats between the polyadenylation and trans-splicing sites of intergenic
regions, in contrast to the exclusive sense orientation of SIDER elements within 3'UTRs. Our data
indicate that SIDER elements are quite uniformly dispersed throughout all three genomes and that
their distribution is generally syntenic. However, only 47.4% of orthologous genes harbor a SIDER
element in all three species. There is evidence for species-specific enrichment of SIDERs and for
their preferential association, especially for SIDER2s, with different metabolic functions.
Investigation of the sequence attributes and evolutionary relationship of SIDERs to other
trypanosomatid retroposons reveals that SIDER1 is a truncated version of extinct autonomous ingilike retroposons (DIREs), which were functional in the ancestral Leishmania genome.
Conclusion: A detailed characterization of the sequence traits for both SIDER subfamilies unveils
major differences. The SIDER1 subfamily is more heterogeneous and shows an evolutionary link
with vestigial DIRE retroposons as previously observed for the ingi/RIME and L1Tc/NARTc couples
identified in the T. brucei and T. cruzi genomes, whereas no identified DIREs are related to SIDER2
sequences. Although SIDER1s and SIDER2s display equivalent genomic distribution globally, the
varying degrees of sequence conservation, preferential genomic disposition, and differential
association to orthologous genes allude to an intricate web of SIDER assimilation in these parasitic
organisms.

Background
Leishmania are parasitic protozoa transmitted by the bite
of phlebotomine sandflies that are endemic to tropical
and subtropical climates worldwide. More than 20 species
of Leishmania cause a wide range of human diseases that
range from self-healing cutaneous lesions (L. major/L.
tropica/L. mexicana) to fatal visceral leishmaniasis (L. donovani/L. infantum/L. chagasi), mucosal leishmaniasis
(mainly Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis), and diffuse
cutaneous leishmaniasis (mainly L. amazonensis/L. guyanensis/L. aethiopica) [1]. Leishmaniasis currently threatens
350 million people in 88 countries. It is estimated that 2
million new cases occur each year, with at least 12 million
people presently infected worldwide [2,3]. Recent reports
also indicate that leishmaniasis is now an emerging zoonosis in the United States [4-6]. Hope for discovering novel
drug and vaccine targets stem from the recently fully
sequenced genomes of several Leishmania species [7,8].
As opposed to higher eukaryotes, Leishmania and other
kinetoplastids seem to have lost or never acquired the
ability to regulate transcription initiation by RNA
polymerase II [9,10]. Transcription has been postulated to
initiate on each chromosome at divergent Strand-Switch
regions (dSS); the 0.9- to 14-kb non-coding regions preceding opposite strand Directional Gene Clusters (DGCs)
[10-12]. These locations display skewed sequence composition which may be functionally relevant to transcription
initiation [13]. Typically, genes are grouped together into
long, same strand polycistronic clusters where individual
mRNAs are processed by trans-splicing and polyadenylation (reviewed in [14,15]). Although there is evidence for
antisense transcription in Leishmania (reviewed in [16]),
nuclear run-on studies have demonstrated that transcriptional orientation is controlled by termination (i.e., RNA
polymerase II promptly aborting transcription in antisense orientation) [17]. It has also been shown that convergent strand-switch (cSS) regions may be involved in
transcriptional termination [11]. In light of these observations, it comes as no surprise that regulation of gene
expression occurs largely at the post-transcriptional level
in these parasites. The discovery of many RNA-binding
protein domains [9,18], regulated processing of cytoplasmic RNAs [19], and conserved regulatory elements in 3'
untranslated regions (3'UTRs) [14,20-23] are hard evidence that corroborate this statement. Several studies have
shown that cis-acting sequences within 3'UTRs regulate
differential expression of the upstream gene mainly by
modulating mRNA stability [14,21,24] or translational
efficiency [23,25-28], although other mechanisms may
exist [14,24].
To date, retroposons and long terminal repeat retrotransposons are the only Transposable Elements (TEs) that
have been described in Leishmania and trypanosome

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/240

genomes. These class I TEs compose up to 5% of trypanosomatid genomes [3,7,29]. Leishmania major and L. infantum are believed to lack potentially active TEs, such as ingi
clade retroposons present in Trypanosoma brucei (ingi) and
T. cruzi (L1Tc) [30]. However, the TE-derived highly
Degenerated ingi/L1Tc-Related Elements (DIREs) have
been reported in certain Leishmania species [31,32].
Recently, small degenerated retroposons (~0.55 kb)
termed SIDERs (Short Interspersed DEgenerated Retroposons) have been identified in the genome of trypanosomes and Leishmania via iterative pairwise BLAST queries
and manual annotation [21]. These extinct repeats are
apparently related to the ingi clade of retroposons, do not
display apparent site-specificity for genomic integration,
and are preponderantly distributed in the intergenic
regions of DGCs. SIDERs represent the most abundant TE
family described in trypanosomatid genomes to date and
can be divided into two subfamilies, namely SIDER1 and
SIDER2, which present similar yet distinguishable
sequence traits. A truncated portion of the antisense
SIDER2 consensus was initially described as RS2 dispersed repeats in L. major mini-chromosomes by Ortiz
and Segovia [33]. SIDER2 repeats have since been identified in L. infantum [34] via a methodology highly similar
to the one employed by Bringaud et al. [21].
This work aims at further improving the characterization
of the highly abundant family of extinct SIDER retroposons in a full-scale comparative genomics framework.
We present the first global characterization of both
SIDER1 and SIDER2 elements via optimized statistical
profiles and sensitive automated annotation in three
sequenced Leishmania species responsible for distinct
pathologies. This enabled the comparison of both subgroups with other trypanosomatid retroposons, hence
unveiling their evolutionary relation. Also, the distribution of SIDER elements within Leishmania genomes and
among orthologous genes demonstrates that these extinct
retroposons are not randomly distributed. Various
hypotheses entailed by this investigation are set forth as
we discuss possible functional and evolutionary implications of the broad assimilation of SIDER elements.

Results
Optimized alignment and automated annotation of
SIDERs
In order to fully characterize both SIDER subgroups in the
genomes of L. major, L. infantum, and L. braziliensis, we
sought an efficient and automated method capable of
producing reliable alignments when confronted with
sequences displaying variable rates of conservation. To
date, the only detailed characterization of SIDER
sequences is a rigorous manual alignment of 1013 L.
major (Lm) SIDER2s set forth by Bringaud et al. [21], while
the SIDER1 subgroup has yet to be properly portrayed.

The scant sequence homology and size polymorphism of
these degenerated retroposons make for irresolute multiple alignments, particularly with regards to the very heterogeneous SIDER1 subgroup. By applying metaheuristics
for global parameter optimization and maximum likelihood estimators to a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) representation of SIDER sequences (see Methods), we
generated a high quality alignment comparable to that
published for LmSIDER2 [21]. This approach allows for
unbiased classification of SIDER subgroups when considering the underlying phylogenetic tree (Figure 1 and Additional File 1).
It is apparent that SIDER elements form two phylogenetically distinct groups when glancing at the global sequence
composition of the two main clusters in Figure 1. To further appreciate subgroup-specific traits, both major phylogenetic subgroups of LmSIDERs were separated and
submitted to independent alignment optimization. Once
filtered to remove highly homologous sequences (>90%
sequence identity), the relative specificity of the initial
profiles was tested by scanning all included LmSIDER
sequences with both HMM profiles using a global alignment algorithm (Additional file 2). Improperly labeled

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/240

sequences (one SIDER1 and 29 SIDER2s) were swapped
to their appropriate profiles that were finally resubmitted
to the same optimization methodology. The resulting
HMM profiles were used for pangenomic queries which
include the initial scans for L. infantum and L. braziliensis.
Results from the latter were submitted to one more round
of optimization to generate the final refined profiles.
Since version 1.8.5 of HMMER software does not assign
expectation values (E-values) to its predictions, we
scanned a randomized synthetic genome of 50 Mb composed of similar nucleotide frequencies (e.g., 40% A+T,
60% C+G) so as to ascertain the specificity of each HMM
profile. A bit-score threshold of 5 limited false positives to
one or two at most for each profile. All false-positives
scored less than 6 with an average of ~1.5 bits (data not
shown). Applying this threshold to all final predictions is
forthright given the reasonably smaller size of Leishmania
genomes (~32 Mb) in comparison to the synthetic control.
Sequence-based characterization of the SIDER1 subgroup
Consensus sequences were extracted from the final
refined profiles for both SIDER subgroups and compared

encompassing 350–700 nt were extracted and submitted to HMM profile training using the simulated annealing and BaumWelch expectation maximization algorithms implemented in HMMER-1.8.5 [65]. Columns containing more than 75% gap characters and failing to present a 10% consensus residue were removed to ease representation. The associated minimal evolution
phylogeny, which was scaled to the alignment overview, was inferred with MEGA4 [66] based on p-distance and considering
pairwise deletions. The red and blue clusters correspond to SIDER2 and SIDER1 sequences, respectively, whereas the grey
cluster contains equal proportions of both SIDERs. Nucleotide composition is as follows: green = adenine; red = thymine; blue
= cytosine; orange = guanine. The individual phylogeny and full alignment can be viewed in Additional file 1.

among the three species (Figure 2). It is apparent that the
SIDER1 cluster is riddled with deletions when compared
to the SIDER2 cluster, though the consensus of both subgroups share 48% sequence similarity. Interestingly,
SIDER1s appear to lack most of the second hallmark
sequence of trypanosomatid retroposons (Figure 2, blue
box) and present G/T-rich insertions at positions 545–
570 when compared to SIDER2 consensus.
To further understand the evolutionary origins of SIDER
elements, we compared their sequence composition to
that of the T. brucei SIDERs (TbSIDERs) and the L. major
Degenerate ingi/L1Tc-Related Elements (LmDIREs). Given
their phylogenetic relationship to TbSIDERs (Figure 3),
Leishmania SIDERs have seemingly diverged a long time
ago, conceivably after the emergence of the genus. Conversely, SIDER1 and SIDER2 subgroups apparently
diverged prior to Leishmania speciation, as both retroposons form separate monophyletic groups. It is also evident that SIDER1s are related to LmDIREs (Figure 3). This
evolutionary relationship is confirmed by the comparative genomic distribution of LmDIRE and LmSIDER1
sequences. Indeed, 46 of the 51 annotated LmDIREs overlap or are in close proximity to LmSIDER1 sequences
(Additional file 3. This clearly indicates that SIDER1 elements are related to the long and potentially coding
DIREs, a situation comparable to the RIME/ingi and
NARTc/L1Tc couples in T. brucei and T. cruzi, respectively.
However, no LmSIDER2 sequences are located in the
vicinity of identified LmDIREs. These observations suggest
that the LmSIDER1 subgroup corresponds to a truncated
version of LmDIREs that has spread throughout Leishmania genomes via the retrotransposition machinery

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/240

encoded by active autonomous retroposons of the ingi
clade (probably an ancestral active version of LmDIRE).
The expansion of LmSIDER1 elements stopped when the
active autonomous ingi-like retroposons disappeared
from the ancestral Leishmania genome and became the
present day LmDIRE vestiges.
Intra- and inter-species chromosomal distribution of
SIDER subgroups
The species- and subgroup-specific optimized HMM profiles were used to annotate the final positions of SIDER
elements in Leishmania genomes (Additional file 4). Both
classes combined, we identified 1853 LmSIDERs (Table
1), an amount which correlates with the initial estimate of
1858 identified with BLASTN and manual annotation
[21]. In addition, we identified 1976 L. infantum SIDERs
(LiSIDERs) and 1986 L. braziliensis SIDERs (LbSIDERs).
Our investigation suggests that the proportion of
LmSIDER1/LmSIDER2 sequences is greater than previously proposed (785:1073 vs. 648:1205). L. infantum and
L. braziliensis ostensibly harbor more SIDER1 sequences
than L. major (740 and 721 vs. 648, respectively).

The results of the aforementioned SIDER search were
combined to 3'UTR predictions generated with PRED-ATERM, a Leishmania-specific mRNA extremity prediction
algorithm [35], in order to ascertain the relative genomic
dissemination of SIDER elements (Table 1). It has been
shown that LmSIDER2s are preponderantly positioned in
the intergenic regions of directional gene clusters and that
most of these elements (73%) reside within 3'UTRs [21].
However, such estimates are derived from mRNA extremity predictions based on an algorithm for the Trypanosoma

genus [36]. As detailed in Table 1, all three sequenced
Leishmania genomes withhold similar proportions of SIDERs predicted in 3'UTRs (73.7–77%). On average, 76% of
SIDERs located in intergenic regions are enclosed in
3'UTRs, at least partially, when considering all possibilities (i.e., sense, antisense and partial). It is quite evident
that SIDERs contained within 3'UTRs are enriched in the
sense orientation (5'→3' in RNA) for all three species. This
observation correlates with the total proportion of SIDERs
in DGCs; sense SIDERs are typically 4-fold more abundant than antisense ones. Given the excess of SIDERs situated in the same orientation as directional gene clusters,
one would assume that SIDER elements located in
"spacer" intergenic regions (sequences between the polyadenylation site and the trans-splicing site) should display
similar statistics. Quite the contrary, antisense SIDERs are
on average over 3-fold more abundant than sense-oriented ones in these interstitial regions. Remarkably, antisense SIDERs that map to these regions do not display
appreciably lower bit-scores, which would be expected for
sequences that are not subjected to purifying selection.
In spite of this, not all SIDER elements are limited to intergenic regions. A significant number of SIDER elements
map to strand-switch regions (i.e., the interstitial noncoding regions that characterize a changing orientation of
DGCs). These chromosomal locations harbor 4–5% of all
identified SIDERs, which are seemingly evenly distributed

between divergent (dSS) and convergent (cSS) strandswitch regions. However, a slight bias for SIDER2s in the
divergent strand-switch regions of L. major and L. braziliensis can be observed (Tables 1 and 2). Scrutinizing the
composition of strand-switch regions illustrates their conspicuous association to SIDER elements, as roughly 40%
contain SIDERs on average (Table 2). Indeed, SIDER2s are
4- to 5-fold more abundant than SIDER1s in these locations and approximately 20-fold more for L. major in particular. There is also evidence that SIDER sequences may
have been co-opted for protein-coding genes or pseudogenes in all three Leishmania species. In some cases, a start
or stop codon intersects with a SIDER element. These hits
to the refined HMM profiles tend to present lower than
average bit-scores for the main part (data not shown). In

agreement with our previous study [21], very little SIDERs
locate to subtelomeric regions (as defined in the Methods
section).
Impact of widespread integration of SIDERs on genomic
organization and plasticity
A large-scale comparative plot of the genomic positions of
SIDER elements with regards to annotated coding
sequences was performed for all three genomes (Additional file 5). The data confirm that SIDER elements of all
types are quite uniformly dispersed throughout all three
genomes. We identified three scenarios that highlight the
impact of degenerated retroposons on the evolution of
Leishmania genomes: (i) the genomic position of SIDERs

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/240

is synonymous with that of the neighboring genomic
locus in all three species (Figure 4A); (ii) SIDERs are
located at different positions for at least one of the three
species (Figure 4B); (iii) reorganization of DGC synteny
(Figure 4C). The latter is an interesting example of chromosomal inversion with SIDER elements flanking the
inverted region. This indicates that SIDERs continue to
forge Leishmania genomes through homologous recombination events despite their extinct functions as transposable elements.
To further address the contribution of SIDERs to the genotypic diversity of Leishmania species, we investigated the
association of these retroposons to orthologous genes in

all three species. All Leishmania ortholog predictions
included in version 2 (29/07/2008) of the L. braziliensis
genome that present no more than one ortholog in L.
major and L. infantum were extracted from GeneDB annotations [8]. The latter rely upon the OrthoMCL algorithm
to predict all orthologs and recent segmental duplications
(also referred to as in-paralogs) [37], thus ensuring that
little or no genes are over-represented in the dataset. A
total of 6802 orthologous genes were retained (L. braziliensis chromosome 20 was excluded from the analysis
for technical reasons), of which 1769 (26%) are potentially associated to at least one SIDER element. Only
47.4% (839 out of 1769) of the orthologs harbor a SIDER
element in all three species (Figure 5). When excluding
these mutually shared retroposons, L. major and L. infantum share the second largest proportion of SIDER-associated orthologs (16%; 279 out of 1769), whereas L.
braziliensis shares only 2.3% and 3% (41 and 54 out of
1769) of the SIDER-associated orthologs with either L.
major or L. infantum, respectively. The observation that
31% of orthologs are associated to SIDERs in only one
species and that another 21% harbor SIDERs in two out of
three species supports the claim that these extinct retroposons may have undergone preferential assimilation or
conservation in some species to some extent.

Functional affiliations of SIDER elements
To determine if SIDER elements are preferentially associated to functionally related genes, we submitted the duplicate-free set of SIDER-associated orthologs to Gene
Ontology (GO) term enrichment via the AmiGO browser
available from the GeneDB website [8,38]. When excluding genes of unknown function, our findings indicate that
both SIDER subfamilies are in some measure preferentially associated with genes belonging to similar functional categories (Additional file 6). When considering Pvalues inferior to 10-2, SIDER2 retroposons are preponderantly enriched in the 3'UTR of metabolic genes
involved mainly in amino acid and amino acid derivative
metabolic processes, nitrogen compound and amine biosyntheses cofactor and coenzyme metabolic processes,
and carbon-carbon lyase and carboxylyase activities in the
three Leishmania species tested. The SIDER1 subfamily is
generally less associated to common functional groupings, yet LiSIDER1s present some evidence for enrichment
in GO terms distinct from SIDER2s, namely cofactor binding and tetracycline transport (Additional file 6). Overall,
the GO term enrichment analysis evokes that SIDER2associated genes share some metabolic functions in all
three species, which is not the case for SIDER1 elements
that associate to genes with divergent GO terms.

orthologs. Numbers represent the exclusive amount of
SIDER-associated orthologous genes shared between each
species. Ortholog predictions were extracted from the L.
braziliensis genome annotation (see text for details).

The next question was to assess if and to what extent
SIDER elements are ontologically enriched in a speciesspecific manner. The non-redundant L. major orthologs
from all 7 categories depicted in Figure 5 were separated
and submitted to GO term enrichment. Only SIDER-associated orthologs with assigned functions were retained for
enrichment evaluation, the results of which are displayed
in Table 3. The table summarizes the non-redundant GO
terms in the sampled orthologs that present a P-value
smaller than 0.01 when compared to the background set
composed of all 4256 functionally annotated genes. It is
apparent that orthologous mRNAs harboring SIDER elements in all three Leishmania species are associated with a
variety of genes chiefly pertaining to metabolic processes
and functions. There is also evidence for species-specific
enrichment of GO terms in ortholog subsets where SIDERs are not present in all species. For instance, L. major
and L. infantum but not L. braziliensis share SIDERs preferentially associated to genes involved in post-translational
protein modification, phosphorylation, methylation,
hydrolase activity acting on ester bonds, and carbon-sulfur lyase activity (Table 3). Conversely, some SIDERs are
strictly associated to L. braziliensis orthologs with significantly related GO terms, notably cell cycle regulation,
ribonucleoside metabolism, and aspartic-type endopeptidase activities. The remaining ortholog subsets comprise
modest sample sizes, which may explain the lack of statistically significant enrichment.

Discussion
The short interspersed degenerated retroposons of Leishmania present varying degrees of conservation and important fragmentation. This renders in silico analyses
challenging, prospectively requiring exhaustive manual
annotation of results. The use of HMM profiles renders
the heterogeneous nature of a multiple sequence alignment into a comprehensive statistical model encoding
both positional base composition and interactions
between residues, hence reducing the subjectivity entailed
by non-profile-based search strategies [39]. Version 1.8.5
of HMMER has the advantage of bearing powerful nucleotide alignment optimization algorithms on top of precise homology search tools. These reasons justify the use
of HMMER over other programs such as PSI-BLAST or
meta-MEME [40,41], although their effectiveness was not
compared in this work. Nonetheless, HMMs have successfully been used to annotate TEs in other studies [42,43]
and have also been shown to be more sensitive than pairwise or sequence-based methods [44-46]. The approach
we advocate enabled the identification of sensibly the
same amount of SIDER sequences in L. major as disclosed
in our previous study [21], however distinct genome
assembly versions may explain the subtle differences (version 4 vs. version 5.2). Slightly more than 100 SIDERs
were identified in L. infantum and L. braziliensis genomes
when compared to the 1858 previously annotated in L.
major.
The relationship between chromosomal proximity and
sequence similarity of SIDER2 repeats in L. infantum was
recently put forward [34]. Requena et al. scrutinized the
composition and arrangement of these elements on chromosomes 20 and 32, then compared the organization of
SIDER2s on chromosome 32 of L. braziliensis and L. major.
A laborious iterative BLASTN annotation strategy was
conducted to uncover 27 LiSIDER2s on chromosome 20
and 54 on chromosomes 32. Using linear extrapolation,
the authors estimated that around 1150 SIDER2s populate the L. infantum genome. In comparison, the automated profiling method employed in this work revealed
27 and 68 high scoring LiSIDER2s for the same chromosomes, respectively, and empirically annotated the position of 1236 LiSIDER2s. In the same article, the authors
establish that LiSIDER2s bear only one of the two 79 nt
signature sequences that characterize the 5' of
LmSIDER2s, and that the syntenic arrangement of
SIDER2s is shared only between L. major and L. infantum
(with regards to chromosome 32). The species-specific
optimized HMM profiles we utilized clearly delineate the
presence of two SIDER2 signature sequences in all three
species (Figure 2). Furthermore, our results present the
relatively conserved syntenic distribution of both SIDER
subgroups for chromosome 32 and all the others (Figure
4 and Additional file 5). These observations further sub-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/240

stantiate the use of profile-based approaches for SIDER
alignment and genomic scanning. Nevertheless, our data
for L. major concur with Requena et al. regarding the phylogenetic clustering of SIDER2s that correlates with chromosomal proximity (see phylogenetic tree in Additional
file 1). This is not the case for the SIDER1 subgroup,
besides the highly similar sequences related to gene duplications.
The remarkable expansion of SIDER sequences throughout Leishmania genomes in conjunction to their involvement in post-transcriptional regulatory processes [14,21]
are evidence that these ancient retroposons underwent
exaptation, or domestication, by their host genomes. This
affirmation is consistent with the strikingly biased distribution of SIDERs within 3'UTRs (Table 1), as confirmed
with recently published computational tools [35]. Our
previous studies have demonstrated a role for SIDER2 elements in post-transcriptional control by promoting
mRNA destabilization [21] and of SIDER1s in translational regulation [20,23]. The ability of transposable elements to contribute regulatory sequences to eukaryotic
genomes is now becoming increasingly apparent [47-52].
SIDER2s in all three analyzed genomes appear to be preferentially associated to groups of genes implicated in
common metabolic processes. It is therefore possible that
these SIDER2-associated genes are regulated in a coordinated manner, for example in response to certain nutrient
availabilities in their environment. Leishmania parasites
are subjected to dynamic environmental changes within
the phagolysosome, which have an immediate impact on
their metabolic regulation [53]. Several examples of coordinated mRNA decay and multi-dimensional networks of
post-transcriptional regulation have been reported in the
budding yeast S. cerevisiae [54-56]. Experiments are now
under way to test this hypothesis in Leishmania.
It has been shown that the 79 nt signature sequence from
the distantly related L1Tc retroposon can promote transcription of the downstream sequence in T. cruzi [57]. Our
data substantiate this finding since divergent strandswitch regions, known to be active transcriptional initiation points [10,11], frequently harbor SIDER elements
(Tables 1 and 2). This outcome is also observed for other
trypanosomatid retroposons [29]. Supporting the possibility that dSS SIDERs promote transcription initiation are
several reports that attest to the profusion of TE-derived
sequences in experimentally characterized human promoters [47,51,52]. Since 30 to 50% of strand-switch
regions contain SIDER elements (Table 2), a considerable
portion of these opposing DGCs may have originated
from homologous recombination events prompted by
SIDER-related repeats, including DIREs.

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:240

A manifest inversion of synteny that is flanked by SIDER
elements in L. infantum (Figure 4C) demonstrates that
short interspersed degenerated retroposons can be
regarded as dynamic elements that play an ongoing role in
genome plasticity and evolution. Also, since many SIDERassociated genes share comparable functions in all combinations of species investigated, such differential recruitment further exposes their contribution to genotypic
diversity. On top of that, the observed enrichment of antisense SIDERs in interstitial pre-mRNA regions (between
polyadenylation and trans-splicing sites) is quite intriguing (Table 1). One cannot rule out that highly conserved
regions shared between sense and antisense SIDER RNA
products could form RNA duplexes, which might play a
role in SIDER-mediated regulation. It has been shown
that TEs contribute tens of thousands of cis natural antisense transcripts to human genes [58-60]. The potential
regulatory effects of these TE-derived antisense transcripts
are substantial. For instance, we have recently shown that
overexpression of antisense SIDER2 RNA can block
SIDER2-mediated mRNA degradation (Müller et al., manuscript submitted for publication).
Our work clearly demonstrates that SIDER1 and SIDER2
belong to two distinct phylogenetic groups. It is also
apparent that, when compared to SIDER2s, SIDER1
sequences are more heterogeneous and bear only the first
79 nt signature (Figures 1 and 2). If one considers that
SIDER1 and SIDER2 elements most likely fulfill distinct
regulatory functions [14,20,21,23] and that the second
signature in SIDER2 is important for SIDER2-mediated
mRNA degradation [Müller et al., manuscript submitted
for publication], the lack of the second signature sequence
in SIDER1 may be an evolutionary feat aiming at diversifying regulatory functions in these parasites. It is tempting
to speculate that the degenerate nature of SIDERs can provide an abundant molecular staple from which de novo cisregulatory elements emerge. Such a highly dynamic
potential of regulation and adaptability is an effective
strategy for a parasite to survive within its host.
Finally, our work demonstrates that the common ancestor
of trypanosomatids contained one or more retroposons
that are no longer active in present day Leishmania species
[3]. Indeed, DIREs (and SIDERs) are the only vestiges of
retroposons belonging to the ingi clade characterized in
Leishmania genomes so far. In L. major, most of the
LmDIREs identified share their extremity or are in a close
proximity to SIDER1 elements (Figure 3 and Additional
file 3). Our experimental annotation of LmSIDER1s did
not exclude hits that overlapped with known DIRE elements, although the low frequency, large size, and poor
conservation of DIRE retroposons in the genome would
not significantly impact HMM modeling when contrasted
to the over 15-fold higher abundance of SIDER1s. Conse-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/240

quently, we postulate that SIDER1 elements have derived
from long active ingi-related retroposons in the ancestral
Leishmania genome, as previously observed for the
trypanosomatid RIME/ingi and NARTc/L1Tc non-autonomous/autonomous retroposon couples [61-63]. The main
difference between these retroposon couples is that ingi
and L1Tc are still active elements, whereas Leishmania
genomes do not contain active retroposon family belonging to the ingi clade. Thus, the active retroposons that gave
rise to SIDER1 is no longer active in the Leishmania genus
as only vestiges have been identified (DIREs). No traces of
a SIDER2 precursor have been detected so far, probably
due to the evolutionary loss of corresponding DIRE
sequences in the L. major genome. The possibility that
such DIRE sequences have not yet been identified cannot
be excluded, although the presence of DIREs in the
genome of the two other Leishmania species has not been
reported to date. The dissemination of SIDER predecessors in intergenic regions supplied Leishmania species with
novel genetic material that contributed to increasing
genomic plasticity and diversifying regulatory functions.
Their assimilation most likely helped the parasite gain an
auspicious evolutionary edge with regards to its complex
parasitic lifestyle. Such a phenomenon is emerging as a
widespread mechanism of assembly and tuning of gene
regulatory systems in eukaryotes [64].

Conclusion
The intra- and inter-genomic characterization of SIDER
elements in three currently sequenced Leishmania
genomes enabled the first direct characterization of
SIDER1s, which are more heterogeneous than SIDER2s,
lack the second 79 nt signature sequence of trypanosomatid retroposons and share sequence traits with DIRE elements. Our results confirm previous reports and establish
that, in addition to the widespread localization of senseoriented SIDERs in 3'UTRs, antisense SIDERs are enriched
in interstitial regions between polyadenylation and transsplicing sites. Our work also demonstrates that divergent
strand-switch regions, proven to be involved in transcription initiation, frequently harbor SIDERs.
The comparative analysis of the distribution of SIDERs
relative to protein-coding genes in three Leishmania species provides evidence that a common Leishmania ancestor
was colonized by one or more active precursor retroposons. Albeit SIDERs are uniformly scattered throughout
the genome, their integration is not random. SIDERs are
to some extent preferentially associated with groups of
genes encoding a similar biological function, which
alludes to their potential role in coordinating gene regulation. The fact that SIDERs demonstrate species-specific
associations to orthologous genes evokes their repercussion on genotypic diversity and possible contribution to
species-specific gene expression. We propose that the

Page 11 of 14

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:240

abundance and diversity of SIDERs increased the plasticity
of Leishmania genomes, providing the genus with molecular thread to weave fine-tuned regulatory fabric in
response to the selective pressures arising from a complex
digenetic parasitic life cycle.

Methods
SIDER retroposon alignment and phylogeny
Initial sequence data was obtained from version 5.2 of the
L. major genome annotation, downloaded from the
GeneDB FTP server [8]. All LmSIDERs spanning between
350 and 700 nucleotides as annotated by Bringaud et al.
[21] were extracted and used to perform multiple alignments using the hmmt program implemented in HMMER1.8.5 software [65]. A first alignment optimization was
produced using the default simulated annealing algorithm while specifying parameters "-r 0.995 -k 10" to override Viterbi refinement and the resulting alignment was
submitted to guided Baum-Welch expectation maximization (parameters "-B -i"). Parsimonious informative columns of the final alignment were submitted to minimum
evolution phylogeny as implemented in the MEGA4 program [66]. The phylogeny was modeled on p-distance
while considering pairwise deletions. The multiple alignment representation was accomplished with Jalview [8].
Generating selective profiles and iterative search strategy
LmSIDER sequences were divided into two subgroups
(SIDER1 and SIDER2) according to their phylogenetic
relationship, then de-gapped and aligned independently
using the same parameters as described above. Any
sequence displaying over 90% sequence identity to
another sequence was discarded, just the same as improperly labeled sequences (e.g., SIDER2 sequences in the
SIDER1 cluster based on the previous manual annotation). The initial SIDER2 alignment was governed by a
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile modeled from the
published manual alignment in order to exploit its meticulous content, then resubmitted to Baum-Welch expectation maximization for sake of consistency. The initial
HMM alignment profiles for L. major were used as a probe
for genome-wide scans in all three sequenced Leishmania
species. The L. major V5.2, L. infantum V3.0a, and L. braziliensis V2.0 genomes were downloaded from the
GeneDB FTP server [8]. The Smith-Waterman-like fragment search (hmmfs) algorithm implemented in HMMER1.8.5 was used to perform all queries. Ad-hoc JAVA scripts
were used to concatenate fractionated hits which are characterized by insertions ≤ 150 nt and to classify hits as
SIDER1 or SIDER2. Dichotomization of overlapping hits
was based on the quotient of the SIDER1/SIDER2 bitscores; a ratio <0.4 was identified as SIDER2, and a ratio
>2.5 as SIDER1. Intervening ratios were assigned to the
subfamily corresponding to the longest hit. The incorporation of search hits into species- and subclass-specific

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/240

refined HMM profiles was governed by three essential
conditions: (i) sequences must encompass 90% or more
of the search profile's consensus; (ii) sequences must
share less than 90% pairwise identity with any other
sequence in the set of results; (iii) score over 50 bits. The
resulting refined HMM profiles were aligned using the
same parameters as described above before being used for
final genomic scans.
Genomic mapping of SIDERs
The prediction of polyadenylation and trans-splicing sites
was performed using the PRED-A-TERM algorithm [35].
We define a strand-switch region as any intergenic
sequence separated by two consecutive protein-coding
genes that display different transcriptional orientations.
We characterize subtelomeric regions as chromosomal
extremities located >5 kb before or after terminal proteincoding sequences. SIDER positions were plotted on their
respective chromosomes via an ad-hoc script and the R
project for statistical computing [15]. All computational
methodologies were carried out with an Intel q6600 processor overclocked to 3.4 GHz with 3GB RAM and Ubuntu
Linux operating system.
