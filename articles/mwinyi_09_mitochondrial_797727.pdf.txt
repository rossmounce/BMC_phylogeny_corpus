Abstract
Background: Mitochondrial genomes are a valuable source of data for analysing phylogenetic
relationships. Besides sequence information, mitochondrial gene order may add phylogenetically
useful information, too. Sipuncula are unsegmented marine worms, traditionally placed in their own
phylum. Recent molecular and morphological findings suggest a close affinity to the segmented
Annelida.
Results: The first complete mitochondrial genome of a member of Sipuncula, Sipunculus nudus, is
presented. All 37 genes characteristic for metazoan mtDNA were detected and are encoded on
the same strand. The mitochondrial gene order (protein-coding and ribosomal RNA genes)
resembles that of annelids, but shows several derivations so far found only in Sipuncula. Sequence
based phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial protein-coding genes results in significant bootstrap
support for Annelida sensu lato, combining Annelida together with Sipuncula, Echiura, Pogonophora
and Myzostomida.
Conclusion: The mitochondrial sequence data support a close relationship of Annelida and
Sipuncula. Also the most parsimonious explanation of changes in gene order favours a derivation
from the annelid gene order. These results complement findings from recent phylogenetic analyses
of nuclear encoded genes as well as a report of a segmental neural patterning in Sipuncula.

Background
Molecular sequence analysis has become the method of
choice to address phylogenetic questions. The applied
techniques improve continually and the rapidly growing
amount of available data helps to broaden our knowledge
of phylogenetic relationships within the animal kingdom.

Nevertheless, different molecular datasets often show
conflicting phylogenetic signals, so that results relying on
just one dataset may be interpreted with caution [1].
Unlike nuclear DNA, the mt-genome of animals is normally rather small and simply structured: haploid, without or only few non-coding segments, repetitive regions

and transposable elements. Derived from endosymbiotic
bacteria only a few genes are retained in the mitochondrial genomes of Bilateria: 13 protein subunits (nad1-6,
nad4L, cox1-3, cob, atp6/8), 2 ribosomal RNAs (rrnL, rrnS)
and 22 tRNAs are found encoded on a circular doublestranded DNA molecule sized about 15 kb [2,3]. As
such sequencing and annotation of mt-genomes is much
easier and faster than analysing nuclear genomes, making
mt-genomes one of the commonly used sources of
sequence data for phylogenetic analyses. Apart from
sequence data other features of the genome may contain
phylogenetic information, too. Taxon-specific gene order
often remains identical over long periods of time [4-6].
Simultaneously, the intra-taxonomic variances of these
characteristic orders are quite distinctive and convergent
changes in the positioning of single genes are rather
unlikely, due to the vast number of possible combinations [7]. Thus changes in the mitochondrial gene order
have proved to be valuable tools in phylogenetic analyses
[8-10]. Less often secondary structures of tRNAs or rRNAs
show distinct differences between taxa (e.g. loss of a stem/
loop region) and hence may also contribute to a phylogenetic analysis [11].
The taxon Sipuncula (peanut worms) comprises about
150 species, being found in all water depths of different
marine habitats. The hemisessile organisms dwell in mud
and sand, but settle also in empty mollusc shells or coral
reef clefts for instance. Their body shows no segmentation, but a subdivision into a posterior trunk and an anterior introvert that can be fully retracted into the trunk is
observeable [12]. Fossils that date back into the later cambrian [13] suggest that sipunculans have undergone little
morphologically change over the past 520 Myr. The
monophyly of this morphologically uniform taxon is well
founded by morphological [14] and molecular data [15].
However, the phylogenetic position within Bilateria was
highly disputed. Based on morphological characters, very
different phylogenetic positions of Sipuncula were discussed. Early in history an affinity to Echinodermata,
especially holothurians was mentioned and later again
propagated by Nichols [16], but with little acceptance
from other authors. Scheltema [17] proposed a close relationship to molluscs based on the presence of the so calles
"molluscan cross" organization of micromeres during spiral cleavage. The usefulness of this character for phylogenetic inference was neglected by Malaskova [18]. Other
analyses found Sipuncula to be sister group of Mollusca,
Annelida and Arthropoda [19], Articulata (Annelida and
Arthropoda) [14], Echiura [20], Mollusca [21], Annelida
[22] or Annelida+Echiura [23]. More details about the different hypotheses of sipunculid relationships are reviewed
in [24].
In contrast to all these studies, molecular analyses of large
datasets from 18S/28S data [25], ESTs [26,27] or mito-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/27

chondrial genome data [28,29] favour an inclusion of
Sipuncula into annelids. An implication of this hypothesis is that we have to assume that segmentation has been
reduced within Sipuncula [30]. A derivation from segmented ancestors of Sipuncula was recently also supported by a segmental mode of neural patterning in
ontogeny [31].
Relationhips within Sipuncula are well investigated
[15,24,32-34]. An analysis using combined molecular
and morphological data recovered five major clades and
supports that Sipunculus is the sister group to all other
sipunculids [15].
Up to now mt-genome data from Sipuncula was restricted
to a partial mtDNA sequence from Phascolosoma gouldii
[29], comprising only about half of the complete genome.
Here we describe the first complete mitochondrial
genome for another representative of the Sipuncula,
Sipunculus nudus. We analyse sequence data in comparison with mitochondrial genomes of various Bilateria to
evaluate the phylogenetic position of Sipuncula. In addition we compare gene order among Lophotrochozoa and
evaluate the most parsimonious explanation for gene
order changes.

Results and discussion
Genome organisation
The complete mt-genome of S. nudus is a circular DNA
doublestrand of 15502 bp length. As usual in bilateria, 13
genes coding for different protein subunits and two
encoding ribosomal RNA genes were identified. In addition 22 tRNA genes were detected and thus all 37 genes
typically present in bilaterian mt genomes, were found
(Fig. 1, Table 1). All of these genes are located on the (+)strand, as is the case in annelid and echiurid mt-genomes.
There are two small gene overlaps: one between nad4L
and nad4 (7 bp), the other one between trnS (AGN) and
nad2 (1 bp). The putative control region is 441 bp in
length and flanked by trnF and trnT. Besides the control
region 15 other non-coding regions are dispersed over the
whole genome, ranging from one to 39 base pairs. The
three largest of these are located between trnY and trnE (35
bp), trnH and nad5 (39 bp) and nad5 and trnS (AGN) (21
bp).

The GC-skew [(G-C)/(G+C)] reflects the relative number
of cytosin to guanine and is often used to describe the
strand-specific bias of the nucleotide composition [35]. In
S.nudus the complete (+)-strand genome sequence has a
clear bias toward Cytosine (GC-skew -0.296). As all genes
are coded on (+)-strand, all single gene sequences exhibit
a negative GC-skew, too (Table 1), ranging from -0.23
(rrnS) to -0.45 (nad2). A negative GC-skew is also found
in most of the mitochondrial genomes known from annelids, pogonophorans, and myzostomids, with the excepPage 2 of 16

tion of the annelid Eclysippe vanelli [36]. AT-skew of the
complete (+)-strand is close to evenness (-0.013) and single gene AT-skews are distributed around evenness with a
range between 0.18 (rrnS) and -0.18 (nad6), see also Table
1. AT content of the complete genome is 54.2%, AT contents of protein-coding and rRNA genes are not much
derived from this value, between a minimum of 50,3%
(nad3) and a maximum of 59,8% (atp8).
Protein coding genes
All but one of the protein subunits begin with start codon
ATG, only nad5 starts with ATA. Both are prevalent in
mitochondrial genomes. The commonly found stop
codons TAA and TAG are present, as well as the abbreviated forms TA (cox2) and T (nad1-4, atp6). Putative short-

ened stop codons were already found in other species and
are thought to be complemented via post-transcriptional
polyadenylation [37].
Ribosomal RNA genes and control region
The sizes of the ribosomal RNAs (rrnS: 846 bp; rrnL: 1487
bp) are within the range of their sizes in other animals
including molluscs and annelids. The two genes only separated by trnV, a feature often found in animals from vertebrates to arthropods, so therefore this represent an
ancestral condition. Among annelids and their kin only
echiurans (Urechis caupo) and myzostomids (Myzostoma
seymourcollegiorum) differ from that condition in that there
is no tRNA gene separating the two ribosomal genes. AT
content of ribosomal genes is 50.8% (rrnS) and 53.1%

(rrnL), so well within the range of AT content of proteincoding genes.
Noncoding regions, putative control region
The putative control region is found between nad3/trnF
on one side and trnT/nad4L/nad4 on the other side. While
gene order (or protein-coding and rRNA genes) in Annelida is more or less conserved there is a great variation in
the position of the control region: (a) Species from Clitellata, Maldanidae and Terebellidae have a major non-coding region between atp6/trnR and trnH/nad5; (b) in
Orbinia it is located between nad4/trnC/trnL2 and trnL1/
trnM/rrnS; (c) in Platynereis it is found between cox2/trnG
and trnV/atp8 [8,28,36,38]. Such great variability is not
found in other taxa like Arthropoda or Vertebrata, where
also the control region is found in the same position in
different species, when gene order of the rest of the mtgenome is conserved.

In Sipunculus nudus the major non-coding region has a size
of 441 bp and is clearly more AT rich (66.1%) than the
rest of the genome (53.9%). Structural elements know
from arthropod mitochondrial control regions [39] are
present also in S. nudus: (1) a poly-TA(A) stretch of 50 bp
including a tenfold TA repeat; (2) a poly-T stretch flanked
by purin bases; (3) a GA-rich block of 16 bases length.
Although we examined the complete non-coding region
intensively by software and by eye, no large stem-loop
structure was identified. Such a structure is normally

Transfer RNAs
All typical 22 tRNAs were detected in the mitochondrial
genome of S. nudus, their putative secondary structures are
depicted in Fig. 2 and Additional file 1. All but three tRNA
genes are capable to be folded in the usual cloverleaf structure, consisting of TψC stem and loop, anticodon stem
and loop, DHU stem and loop, and the acceptor stem –
tRNA-Ser(AGN) and tRNA-Ser(UCN) have no DHU stem.
While tRNA-Ser(AGN) shows this feature in many bilaterian mt-genomes, the other one must have changed its
secondary structure in the lineage leading to Sipuncula
and after the split of its sister group. The putative secondary structure of tRNA-Cys shows no TψC, in addition there
are two mismatches in the anticodon stem and an unusual
anticodon (ACA), weakening this secondary structure
hypothesis. But intensive search for an alternative
sequence of tRNA-Cys was not successful, so we stuck with
this hypothesis although we cannot rule out that this is a
non-functional sequence or subject to gene editing. In several other tRNAs there are mismatches in the acceptor or
anticodon stem.
Mitochondrial gene order
Fig. 3 shows a comparison of lophotrochozoan mitochondrial gene orders and the ground pattern of Bilateria
(as mentioned in [40]). We restrict the discussion of gene
order to the protein-coding and rRNA genes, as tRNA
genes change their relative position much faster than the
former, as seen in gene order comparisons of e.g. annelids
[8] or crustaceans [41]. The annelids, pogonophorans and
myzostomids do not differ from each other in the relative
positions of protein-coding and rRNA genes. Compared
to the ground pattern of Bilateria several genes have a different relative position: (1) nad6/cob are found right after
cox3, (2) atp6 is found between cob and nad5, (3) nad5 and
nad4L/nad4 have interchanged positions, and (4) nad3 is
found between nad1 and nad2 (numbers refer also to
hypothesized events in Fig. 4). Mollusca (Conus textile
[42], Ilyanassa obsoleta [43]) and Brachiopoda (Terebratulina retusa [44]) show a different pattern, with derived
positions for three gene blocks: rrnS/rrnL/nad1, cox3/nad3
and nad6/cob. The translocation of nad6/cob may be
explained as a commonly derived feature of Lophotrochozoa, or a subtaxon of it including Mollusca, Phoronida,
Brachiopoda, Nemertea, Annelida s. l. (including Pogonophora, Echiura and Myzostomida) and Sipuncula (compare Fig. 4). The other translocation events found in
annelids and their kin (2.–4.) seem to be restricted to that
group. The gene order so far known from Nemertea
(Cephalothrix rufifrons, partial genome [45]) can be easily
derived with one change (translocation of nad6) from the
pattern of the brachiopod Terebratulina and the gene order

of Phoronida (Phoronis psammophila, partial genome [46])
from that of the mollusc Katharina tunicata with only one
event (translocation of atp6). Much more variation is seen
within Mollusca [6,47] and Brachiopoda [48-50] (not
shown).
Compared to the Annelida and their kin, the mitochondrial gene order of Sipunculus nudus differs clearly: (a) atp6
and nad5 are found between nad1 and nad2. This may be
interpreted as two events restricted to the sipunculid lineage and independently achieved from the bilaterian or
lophotrochozoan ground pattern. But another explanation would be a singular event translocating the block
atp6/nad5 compared to the annelid ground pattern (No. 8
in Fig. 4); (b) rrnS/rrnL found a different position,
between cob and nad3 – this is as well different from the
situation in Brachiopoda and Mollusca, so probably
another event in the lineage leading to Sipuncula (No. 9
in Fig. 4); (c) nad3 is found right after rrnL and adjacent to
nad4L/nad4. This is different from its position in annelids,
pogonophorans, myzostomids and echiuran taxa and is
more similar to the bilaterian ground pattern. Visualized
in Fig. 4 the most parsimonious explanation of sipunculid
gene order is that Sipuncula share two events with annelids, but lack the translocation of nad3. In addition two
events have to be assumed in the lineage of Sipunula
(rrnS/rrnL and atp6/nad5, corresponding to 8 and 9 in Fig.
4). Derivation of the Sipunculus gene order directly from
the bilaterian ground pattern would demand four translocation events (nad6/cob, rrnS/rrnL, atp6, nad5) from which
only one is shared with other lophotrochozoan taxa
(nad6/cob). So this hypothesis is in demand of three additional events instead of two for the "annelid" hypothesis.
Derivation of the sipunculid gene order from the brachiopod/mollusc pattern is in demand of five additional
events. Therefore the most parsimonious explanation of
gene order changes would be that Sipuncula is sister group
to a group comprising Annelida s.str., Myzostomida,
Echiura and Pogonophora.
At first sight gene order of the echiurid Urechis caupo [51]
is completely different from that of annelids and Sipunculus, but the position of atp6 between cob and nad5 and that
of nad3 adjacent to nad1 clearly hint to the derived features postulated for the annelid ground pattern (see b and
c in the discussion of annelid gene order above). As well
adjacency of nad6 to cox3 is found in all annelids and Sipunuculus. So the gene order of Urechis may be derived from
the annelid ground pattern, with additional translocations of three genome segments: (a) cox1/cox2/atp8, (b)
rrnS/rrnL and (c) nad2.
Phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial sequences
The phylogenetic analysis was performed with a concatenated amino acid alignment of 11 protein-coding genes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/27

(exept atp8 and nad4L) from 74 species. Fig. 5 shows the
best tree of the Maximum Likelihood analysis with RaxML
(mtREV+G+I). A close relationship of Sipunculus and Phascolopsis and thus monophyletic Sipuncula is well supported (ML bt: 100%). Sipuncula appears to be close
related to the classic "Annelida", Echiura and Pogonophora – this assemblage has a bootstrap support of 93%.
This assemblage is also other recovered in recent molecular analyses of 18S/28S rRNA and EF1α [25] or EST data
[26]. The internal relationships of these taxa are not well
resolved by our analysis. With high bootstrap support
Clitellata (98%) and Pogonophora (100%) appear monophyletic, while their sister group relationship found only
weak support (bootstrap: 75%). Sister group to the Sipuncula/Annelida/Echiura/Pogonophora taxon is Myzostomida (ML bt: 91%), this relationship is also supported by
morphological characters and mitochondrial gene order
as recently detailed elsewhere [8]. The position of this
"Annelida sensu lato" among other Lophotrochozan subtaxa is not well resolved in our analysis.
Probably due to long branch effects, Ecdysozoa and
Lophotrochoza appear not to be monophyletic in our
analysis. While the former miss Nematoda, the latter miss
Platyhelminthes, Ectoprocta, Rotifera, Acanthocephala
and some molluscs. All these taxa are associated with long
branches and form a probably artificial clade, which was
never recovered in analyses with molecular data from
nuclear genes or morphological data. Apart from this the
most "problematic" taxon are Mollusca, with some taxa
(Lottia, Argopecten, Venerupis, Siphonodentalium) found
clustering with the above mentioned nematode-platyhelminth assemblage, others (Katharina, Haliotis, Nautilus,
Octopus) clustering with Nemertea, Phoronida and Entoprocta, while Lampsilis appears as sister taxon to Brachiopoda.
For further evaluation the interrelationships of Annelida
sensu lato, we performed additional phylogenetic analyses with a smaller taxon set comprising 30 species (all species from the lophotrochozoan branch of the larger taxon
set). ML analyses were done comparing mtREV (RaxML)
and mtART (Treefinder) models; in addition a Bayesian
analysis was performed with mtREV model (MrBayes).
Myzostomida, Sipuncula and other Annelida formed a
monophyletic group (Fig. 6) supported by ML bootstrapping (mtREV: 92%, mtART: 98%), but not by BI, where
support is below 0.95 (Bayesian posterior probabilities).
Sipuncula and Annelida together form a clade well supported by all three analyses, while Annelida without
Sipuncula found best support only in BI, while the ML
analyses do not significantly support this group, leaving
open if there is a basal split between Sipuncula and the
rest of the annelids. In the best ML-mtART tree Platynereis
is found as sister to Sipuncula tree, but with bootstrap

support below 50%. Well supported subtaxa of annelids
are Pogonophora (s.lato), Clitellata, Pogonophora+Clitellata, Orbiniidae (Scoloplos+Orbinia). Topologies
obtained in the three analyses differ in the position of Urechis (Echiura), which is found as sister to Maldanidae+Terebelliformia in the best ML tree with mtREV model
(bootstrap support 65%), as sister to Orbiniidae in the
best tree with mtART model (bootstrap support below
50%) and as sister to Pogonophora+Clitellata in BI (BPP
below 0.95).
In addition we performed an AU test as implemented in
CONSEL to statistically test the hypothesis of a sister
group relationship between Sipuncula and Mollusca. We
were able to significantly reject (p < 0.001) this hypothesis
compared to the best ML-tree (mtREV).

Conclusion
Annelida, in traditional phylogenetic systems the sister
group to Arthropoda, are nowadays included in the taxon
Lophotrochozoa by almost all large scale analyses
[26,27,52-54]. In this view more and more molecular
studies no longer support the monophyly of the classical
Annelida ("polychaetes" and clitellates). As well as the
unsegmented Pogonophora, Echiura, and Myzostomida
the Sipuncula have also been under suspect to be included
in what was called Annelida sensu lato [8,25,26,28]. The
complete mitochondrial genomic sequence of Sipunculus
nudus presented in this paper, adds an important piece of
evidence to answer the question of sipunculid position in
the metazoan tree of life. Our sequence data and gene
order analysis clearly support an affinity of Sipuncula to

Annelida s. l. (including Pogonophora, Echiura and
Myzostomida) rather than to Mollusca or any other phylum. It still remains an open question if Sipuncula and the
whole Annelida s. l. are sister groups (as the most parsimonious explanation of gene order data suggests), or if
Myzostomids form the sister group to Sipuncula and the
remaining Annelida (as sequence based analyses favour).
In sequence-based analyses the myzostomid is the annelid taxon with the longest branch, suggesting a more rapid
evolution of mitochondrial sequence in this taxon. Therefore analyses placing Myzostomids outside the Annelida
are probably misleading due to higher substitution rates
in myzostomids.

Methods
Animals, DNA purification
A specimen of S. nudus was collected in Concarneau,
France and conserved in 100% ethanol. Using the
DNeasy® Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany)
we followed the instructions given to extract DNA from
animal tissues and used approximately 1 × 1 cm of the
body wall from one individual.
PCR and purification of DNA fragments
EST sequence fragments for the genes nad1, nad3, rrnL,
cob, cox1, cox2 and cox3 were used to design the first species specific primer pairs [27]. The complete mitochondrial genome of S. nudus was amplified in PCR fragments
generated with species specific primer pairs from EST
information (see Table 2). All PCRs were done with
Eppendorf Mastercycler or Eppendorf Mastercycler Gradient thermocyclers. PCRs were carried out in 50 μl volumes

(41.75 μl water, 5 μl 10× buffer, 0.25 μl Taq polymerase
(5 U/μl), 1 ml dNTP mixture, 1 μl template DNA, 1 μl
primer mixture (10 μM each)) using the Eppendorf 5prime kit (Eppendorf, Germany). The cycling conditions
were as follows: 94°C for 2 min (initial denaturation); 40
cycles of 94°C for 30 sec (denaturation); primer-specific
temperature (see Table 2) for 1 min (annealing), 68°C for
1 min (elongation), was followed by 68°C for 2 min
(final elongation). After 40 cycles the samples were stored
at 4°C and visualised on a 1% ethidium bromide-stained
TBE agarose gel, respectively. DNA fragments expected to
be larger than 3 kb, were amplified in 25 μl volumes
(16.75 μl water, 2.5 μl buffer, 0.25 μl Takara LA Taq
polymerase, 4 μl dNTP mixture, 1 μl template DNA, 0.5 μl
primer mixture (10 μM each)) under the following long
PCR conditions (Takara LA kit): 94°C for 2 min (initial
denaturation); 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec (denaturation), primer-specific temperature for 1 min (annealing)
and 72°C for 10 min (elongation). After the final elongation step (68°C for 2 min), samples were treated as
described above. PCR products were purified with minispin columns provided in the Nucleo Spin Extract II kit
(Macherey & Nagel) and the Blue Matrix PCR/DNA clean
up DNA Purification kit (EurX, Gdansk, Poland). Dependent on the band intensity on the agarose gel, DNA was
eluted in 30–60 μl elution buffer and stored at -20°C.
Slightly contaminated samples were cut from a 1% ethidium bromide-stained TAE agarose gel and purified with
the QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen) afterwards.
Cloning
If the DNA amount, obtained by PCR, turned out to be
insufficient for sequencing, the respective fragment was
cloned in a pGEM-T Easy Vector (Promega). Ligation was
carried out in 5 μl volumes instead of the double amount,
proposed in the protocol. In each case 2 μl of the sample
were used for transformation in 50 μl competent E. coli XL
Gold (Stratagene) cells. Colonies, containing recombinant plasmids, were detected via blue-white screen on
LB selection plates, charged with IPTG, ampicillin and Xgal. To check whether the desired insert had been really
transferred to the picked out colonies, a minimum
amount of each colony (approximately half of it) was utilized as DNA template in a colony PCR. PCRs were run in
50 μl volumes (ingredients, amounts and conditions as
above named), using M13F and M13R vector primers.
Products were checked on 1% TBE agarose gels and – if
they contained an insert of the anticipated size – transferred to LB/ampicillin medium. After proliferation over
night, samples were purified according to the guidelines
of the Quantum Prep-Kit (Bio Rad) and finally stored at 20°C.
Sequencing and gene annotation
The amplified fragments were set up in 10 μl reaction volumes (2.5 μl DNA, 2.5 μl water, 1 μl primer (10 μM), 4 μl

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/27

DCTS master mix) and sequencing PCR reactions were
carried out according to the following procedure: 96°C
for 20 sec (denaturation); primer-specific temperature for
20 sec (annealing); 60°C for 2 min (elongation). After 30
cycles the samples were sequenced with a CEQ™8000 capillary sequencer (Beckmann-Coulter) and the appropriate
CEQ DCTS Quick Start kit (Beckmann-Coulter).
While the first checking of the sequences was carried out
with the CEQ 8000 software (Beckman-Coulter), the
actual sequence assemblage was done with BioEdit, version 7.0.5 [55]. Protein coding and ribosomal RNA genes,
encoded in the mtDNA, were identified by BLAST (blastn,
tblastx) searches on NCBI databases and by aligning the
different sipunculid fragments with the mt genome of the
echiurid Urechis caupo. To revise the final consensus
sequence of S. nudus, further mt-genome data of relatively
closely related taxa were retrieved from the OGRe database [56]. The species used for sequence comparison were:
Platynereis dumerilii (Annelida), Clymenella torquata
(Annelida), Orbinia latreillii (Annelida), Lumbricus terrestris (Annelida), Terebratalia transversa (Brachiopoda), Terebratulina retusa (Brachiopoda), Laqueus rubellus
(Brachiopoda), Urechis caupo (echiura), Epiperipatus biolleyi (Onychophora), and Flustrellidra hispida (Bryozoa),
see Table 3 for accession numbers. Transfer RNA genes
and their putative secondary structures, were determined
with the tRNAscan-SE [57] and ARWEN [58] and for the
missing ones by eye inspection of candidate regions. The
genome sequence was deposited in NCBI database [GenBank: FJ422961].
Phylogenetic analysis
The amino acid alignments of the protein-coding genes
(except the two short and highly variable genes atp8 and
nad4L) were concatenated. Sequence data from 74 species
were included in the large analyses (see Table 3 for all species names and accession numbers). The tree was rooted
with two representatives of Cnidaria. Maximum likelihood analysis was performed with RAxML, ver. 7.00
[59,60]. mtREV+G+I was chosen as model for aminoacid
substitutions. The complete dataset was partitioned, so
that model parameters and amino acid frequencies were
optimized for each single gene alignment. 100 bootstrap
replicates were performed to infer the support of clades
from the best tree. A second set of analyses were done with
a reduced dataset of 30 species. This dataset was analyzed
with RAxML as described above (model mtREV+G+I, partitioned according to the 12 single gene sequences), with
1000 bootstrap replicates. Secondly we did a Bayesian
analysis with MrBayes ver. 3.1.2 [61]. In BI the
mtREV+G+I model was used and 1.000.000 generations
were run with 8 chains in parallel. Trees were sampled
every 1000 generations, while the first 200 trees were discarded as burn-in (according to the likelihood plot). In
addition we performed a ML analysis using the

Additional material

For comparison of the hypothesis that sipunculids might
be closely related with molluscs and our best tree, we used
a constraint for a ML-analysis (Sipuncula + Mollusca) of
the sequence dataset using RaxML [59] with parameters
described above. We computed per-site log-likelihoods
with RAxML for both topologies (best tree and constrained topology) and conducted an au-test as implemented in CONSEL [63].
