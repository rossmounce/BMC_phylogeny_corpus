Abstract
Background: Fruits from several species of the Rosaceae family are reported to cause allergic reactions in
certain populations. The allergens identified belong to mainly four protein families: pathogenesis related 10
proteins, thaumatin-like proteins, lipid transfer proteins and profilins. These families of putative allergen genes in
apple (Mal d 1 to 4) have been mapped on linkage maps and subsequent genetic study on allelic diversity and
hypoallergenic traits has been carried out recently. In peach (Prunus persica), these allergen gene families are
denoted as Pru p 1 to 4 and for almond (Prunus dulcis)Pru du 1 to 4. Genetic analysis using current molecular tools
may be helpful to establish the cause of allergenicity differences observed among different peach cultivars. This
study was to characterize putative peach allergen genes for their genomic sequences and linkage map positions,
and to compare them with previously characterized homologous genes in apple (Malus domestica).
Results: Eight Pru p/du 1 genes were identified, four of which were new. All the Pru p/du 1 genes were mapped
in a single bin on the top of linkage group 1 (G1). Five Pru p/du 2 genes were mapped on four different linkage
groups, two very similar Pru p/du 2.01 genes (A and B) were on G3, Pru p/du 2.02 on G7,Pru p/du 2.03 on G8 and
Pru p/du 2.04 on G1. There were differences in the intron and exon structure in these Pru p/du 2 genes and in
their amino acid composition. Three Pru p/du 3 genes (3.01–3.03) containing an intron and a mini exon of 10 nt
were mapped in a cluster on G6. Two Pru p/du 4 genes (Pru p/du 4.01 and 4.02) were located on G1 and G7,
respectively. The Pru p/du 1 cluster on G1 aligned to the Mal d 1 clusters on LG16; Pru p/du 2.01A and B on G3
to Mal d 2.01A and B on LG9; the Pru p/du 3 cluster on G6 to Mal d 3.01 on LG12; Pru p/du 4.01 on G1 to Mal d
4.03 on LG2; and Pru p/du 4.02 on G7 to Mal d 4.02 on LG2.
Conclusion: A total of 18 putative peach/almond allergen genes have been mapped on five linkage groups. Their
positions confirm the high macro-synteny between peach/almond and apple. The insight gained will help to identify
key genes causing differences in allergenicity among different cultivars of peach and other Prunus species.

Background
In general, eating fruit is strongly recommended to
improve health, but this can cause an allergic reaction in
certain individuals. Most fruit crops in temperate and
some subtropical zones belong to the Rosaceae family,
mainly the subfamilies Maloideae and Prunoideae. Fruits
from the Maloideae, like apple [1,2] and pear [3], and
Prunoideae such as peach [4,5], sweet cherry [6,7], plum
[8], apricot [9] and almond [10] have been reported to
cause allergic reactions in Europe. The annual peach production in China has been around 6 million tons in recent
years, and has lead to both an increase in peach consumption and more prevalent fruit allergy.
It is considered that general avoidance of fruit has a negative effect on health in allergic patients and also affects
their quality of life. Therefore, the low allergic property of
fruit is worth considering in new peach breeding programs. As cultivars of the same species differ in allergenicity [11], the selection and breeding of new, low-allergenic
cultivars is becoming feasible by a multidisciplinary
approach, such as in the EU-SAFE project [1], where doctors and plant geneticists identified the apple cultivar
'Santana' as low allergenic in the majority of Dutch
patients with a history of allergy to apple [12]. A similar
approach was initiated in peach in recent years through
collaboration between China and Europe.
A variety of allergens from different fruits have been identified by means of experimental immunology and molecular biology, in particular by protein and gene
identification and sequencing[13]. From the structural
and biochemical point of view, fruit allergens identified
belong to a limited number of protein families [13]. In the
case of Rosaceae, the majority of allergens present in fresh
fruit belong to four families: pathogenesis-related protein
10 (PR-10 protein, birch allergen Bet v 1 homologues),
thaumatin-like proteins (TLP, PR-5 proteins), non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs, PR-14 proteins) and
profilins (PRF) [13]. Whole, unprocessed fruit containing
PR-10 protein elicit allergy, while TLP, LTP and profilins
are stable proteins because of intra-molecular disulfide
bonds. These four allergen families in Prunus fruits are
already on the international allergen list http://www.aller
gen.org. In peach they are denoted as Pru p 1 (PR10), Pru
p 2 (TLP), Pru p 3 (LTP), and Pru p 4 (profilin), and in
almond as Pru du 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Due to the
common structure and properties of each protein family
over a wide range of plant species, genera and even families, allergy cross-reactivity has been frequently observed,
for example between Pru p 1 and Mal d 1 proteins from
peach and apple respectively with Bet v 1 proteins in birch
pollen [14]. Peach allergy occurs more often in southern
Europe, and two different peach allergy profiles have been
observed in Spain. One of these is the oral allergy syn-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/543

drome (OAS) caused by Pru p1 and Pru p 4, the other is
the systemic gastrointestinal symptom caused by Pru p 3
[15]. In China both profiles have also been reported after
eating fresh peach [16]. In addition, some contact with
peach fruit hair or even with pollen during the blooming
season caused adverse reactions (from some patients'
claims).
Genomic characterization of the sequences and linkage
map positions of the four apple allergen gene families
were reported in 2005 [17-19], and subsequent associations between the genetic constitution and allergenicity of
different cultivars gave the first indications on the isoallergens (genes) and protein variants (alleles) involved in low
and high allergenic responses [20]. Comparison between
apple (Malus domestica) and Prunus linkage maps suggests
a high level of synteny of the linkage groups between
these two genera [21]. For Prunus G1, the upper part contains several RFLP markers that aligned with apple LG13
and LG16 on which the majority of Mal d 1 genes are
located, and the lower part aligned with LG8, where Mal d
4.03A is located. Prunus G3 aligns with apple LG9 where
apple Mal d 2.01A/B and Mal d 4.01 were mapped. Therefore, some of the homologous allergen genes of Prunus
fruit may be located at syntenic positions as compared
with the apple genome.
In peach, differences in major allergen Pru p 1 (PR-10)
and Pru p 3 (LTP) content among cultivars have been
reported in recent years [11,22], which encouraged us to
conduct research similar to that done in apple [17-19].
Advances in three aspects make the genomic research of
Prunus allergen genes possible. First, a set of candidate
genes is now available based on previous medical and
molecular biology research [23-25]. Second, a large
number of peach fruit ESTs are available in databases
(mainly from researchers in Chile, Italy and USA), allowing us to find different members of the four putative allergen gene families. Third, a highly saturated genetic Prunus
reference map T × E (based on the F2 progeny of 'Texas'
almond and 'Earlygold' peach) and a simple bin-mapping
strategy [26] provides an efficient and reliable way to map
new genes.

Results
PCR-based cloning and individual clone sequencing with
genomic DNA templates of the Prunus T × E F1 hybrid
(MB1-73, the plant used for the generation of the T × E F2
population by selfing), produced 35 consensus sequences
(GenBank: EU424239-EU424273) represent 18 different
gene loci. Within a single gene locus, two putative alleles
from peach and almond were distinguished through
marker test and sequence comparison. The total length of
each sequence and length of its open reading frames
(ORFs), exon and intron are summarized in Table 1. Prim-

ers used for linkage mapping are presented in Table 2.
Each gene family is described below in more detail.
Pru p/du 1 (PR-10) genes
According to four Pru p 1 cDNA reference sequences
derived from peach fruit in the GenBank database, we
obtained 15 different PR-10 DNA sequences [GenBank:
EU424239-EU424253] from MB1-73 by PCR cloning,
and classified them into eight distinct gene members
based on their DNA sequence identity less than 98%, of
which four were new (Pru p/du 1.05 and Pru p/du 1.06A-C)
(Table 1) and formed a new group distinct from the initial
reference sequence [GenBank:DQ251187] (Pru p 1.01).
All Pru p/du 1 genes had a single intron with variable size,
(98–233 nt) and two exons of 184 nt and 299 nt each,
except in the second exon in Pru p/du 1.04 that was 296 nt
long. Alleles derived from almond cv 'Texas' and peach cv
'Earlygold' had different intron sizes in four Pru p/du 1
members (Table 1), used to map these genes in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). DNA sequence divergence between allele from peach and almond is very low
(1%–2.1%). Amino acid (aa) sequences from these genes
were deduced from their coding DNA sequences (Figure
1). Most Pru p/du 1 had 160 aa, except for Pru p/du 1.04
with 159aa, with the common feature of a p-loop (GxGGxGxxK). Overall aa sequence identity among different
isoallergen was 71.9%–98.8%, and three Pru p 1.06 members (A, B, C) have about 98% aa sequence identity (Figure 1). Segments of identical aa sequence were found in

several locations, especially surrounding the p-loop. Pru
p/du 1.01 had a proline (P) residue in the p-loop, which
is similar to Mal d 1.01 and 02 and all Bet v 1, while the
other Pru p/du 1 isoallergens had a valine (V) in this position. The predicted protein molecular weights were in the
range of 17.1–17.5 kDa, and pI values ranged from 4.9 to
6.0. Comparing the aa composition between alleles from
peach and almond of each gene in Figure 1, we found that
there was only one difference for Pru p/du 1.01, 02, 03, 04
and 06B, while Pru p/du 1.05 and Pru p/du 1.06A differed
by 2 and 5 aa, respectively. A phylogenetic tree of the
deduced amino acids from peach cv. 'Earlygold' alleles
and those in apple (mainly cv. 'Fiesta') (Figure 2A)
showed that at least one Pru p 1 isoallergen member is
present in each of the four subfamilies of apple Mal d 1
genes (PR-10) identified in a previous study [17]. Furthermore, we can see in the subfamily III branch that Pru p
1.05 and three highly similar Pru p 1.06 members (A-C)
clustered with three Mal d 1.06 members (A-C), while
Pru-1.04 clustered together with Mal d 1.07, one of the
apple intronless genes in subfamily IV. All eight Pru p/du
1 genes mapped to bin 1:14, at the top of G1 (Figure 3A,
Table 1).
Pru p/du 2 (TLP)
Analysis of the peach TLP sequences in the NCBI identified four members of this gene family at the start. A single
primer pair based on [GenBank:AF362988] resulted in
four very similar sequences assigned as two separate genes

the deduced precursor of Prunus TLPs with the reference
TLP amino acid sequences in the Rosaceae and other
plants, we assigned the putative signal peptides to deduce
the mature protein (Figure 4). Pru p/du 2.02 had a shorter
signal peptide, 23 aa in peach and 21 aa in almond, while
the other four members had a 24 aa signal peptide. They
differed considerably in protein size, with Pru p/du 2.03
and Pru p/du 2.04 having longer peptides in the C-terminal than Pru p/du 2.01 and 02. Amino acid sequences
identity from alleles from peach and almond for five Pru
p/du 2 members are different, they are 84.4% for Pru p/du
2.02, about 96% for Pru p/du 2.01A and -01B, 98% for
Pru p/du 2.03, and 99.4% for Pru p 2.04 p/du 2.04.
Based on the percentage amino acid identity among
five Pru p 2 isoallergens, Pru p 2.01A, 01B and 2.02
were clustered with four apple Mal d 2 (01A, 01B, 02
and 03) (Figure 2B) proteins. Pru p 2.01A and 2.01B
had 96.7% identity in their aa sequence, their closest
homologous members being apple Mal d 2.01A and B.

Pru p 2.03 and 2.04 are quite distant from 2.01 and
2.02 (Figure 2B) and no close counterparts were found
in apple. The overall sequence identity level in amino
acids among the four Pru p 2 proteins was around 40%
(Figure 2B), but a long sequence region (DFYDVSLVDG
[F/Y]NLPM) around position 130, and the typical 16
cysteine (C) to form 8 disulfide bonds, were conserved
in all Pru p/du 2 members. Mature Pru p 2.01A, 02 and
04 proteins were acidic (pI around 4–5), whereas Pru p
2.01B and 3 were basic (pI 7.9–8.17). Mature Pru p
2.01 and 02 had a molecular weight of about 23 kDa.
Mature Pru p 2.03 differed in length and weight with
mature Pru du 2.03, with the molecular weight being
25.23 kDa and 27.46 kDa respectively. Mature Pru 2.04
had the highest number of aa (307) with a calculated
molecular weight of 30.7 kDa. Unlike the Pru p 1 genes
that were placed in a single bin, these five Pru p/du 2
members mapped on four linkage groups: Pru p/du 2.01
A and B on G3, -2.02 on G7, -2.03 on G8, and -2.04 on
G1 (Figure 3A, C, D, E).

two exons and one intron (Table 1). The size of the second
exon was conserved and extremely short (10 nt), while the
first was variable (344, 362 and 341 nt). Sequences from
peach and almond LTPs are highly conserved in exon and
intron size, with only one base pair length difference in
introns of Pru p/du 3.02 and 3.03 (Table 1).
The deduced pre-mature Pru p 3 proteins had different
signal peptide lengths of 26 aa, 30 aa and 25 aa for Pru p/
du 3.01–03, respectively (Figure 5). In peach and almond
(E and T), Pru p/du 3.01 alleles had identical signal amino
acids, but their mature proteins differed in 5 aa, of which
4 are at the C-terminal end. Pru p/du 3.02 had identical
aa, and Pru p/du 3.03, only one amino acid difference P/
T at position 88. The three Prunus LTPs isoallergens differed greatly in their signal peptide region, with about 40–
80% sequence identity (Figure 2C), their alignments were
according to the eight conserved cysteine residues (Figure
5). All mature Pru p/du 3 were alkaline (pI = 8.5–9.22)
and their molecular weight was around 9 kDa. Pru p 3.01
grouped closely with apple Mal d 3.01 and 02 (Figure 2C),
and Pru p 3.02 with the putative Mal d 3.03 (e-cloning
analysis assigned). Pru p 3.03 is distant from Pru p 3.01
and -02, and shares about 50% aa identity with the others.
Interestingly, all three Pru p 3 genes mapped on bin 6:74
(Figure 3B). One of them, Pru p 3.03 (as Ltp2), had previously been mapped using the whole TxE population and
was located at 72.5 cM from the top of G6 [19].
Pru p/du 4 (profilin, PRF)
Genomic sequences for two profilin genes Pru p/du 4.01
and Pru p/du 4.02 were obtained based on their cDNA
data [GenBank: EU424270-EU424273]. Both genes have

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/543

three exons with conserved length, 123, 138 and 135 nt,
in agreement with that found in most plant species. DNA
polymorphisms in Pru p/du 4.01 occurred mainly in the
first intron, but in Pru p/du 4.02 they were in the first and
second exon. These two genes gave the same protein
sequences for peach and almond (Figure 6), although a
few synonymous polymorphisms existed at the gDNA
level. Molecular weights were 14.06 and 14.19 kDa for
Pru p 4.01 and 4.02, respectively, and both were acidic
(calculated pI 4.5 and 4.6). Compared with the six known
Mal d 4 isoallergens, Pru p 4.01 was similar to Mal d
4.03A and B (93.1% and 93.9% identity), while Pru p
4.02 was similar to Mal d 4.02A and B (95.4% and 96.9%
identity) (Figure 2D). Pru p 4.01 was mapped on G1 and
Pru p 4.02 on G7 (Figure 3A and 3D).

Discussion
This study provides basic genomic sequences and map
positions of four allergen families in Prunus persica
(peach) and Prunus dulcis (almond). This information is a
prerequisite for unravelling the genetic basis of allergenic
characteristics of Prunus fruits, and is likely to be similar
for other Prunus species due to the high level of synteny of
the species within this genus [21].
Gene families and relevance of individual genes in
allergenicity
Gene family is becoming a prevailing topic in genomic
research. It is thought that the pressure to conserve protein
sequence and structure is associated with an increase in
copy number of certain genes during evolution [27].
Although food allergens belong to a limited number of
protein families [28], each protein family in a single spe-

cies can be putatively encoded (experimentally demonstrated in some cases) by multiple genes in specific tissues,
thus making the in vivo allergic reaction very complex.
There is a need to identify genes implicated in the allergic
reaction from the many putative allergen genes existing.
Searching the updated Arabidopsis thaliana DNA sequence
database, we found 29 putative Pru p 1-homologous genes
scattered over the five chromosomes (Table 3). More than
half of these (17/29) are located on chromosome 1 in four
clusters, each with 3 to 7 genes. Nineteen TLP genes are
present on four chromosomes. LTP genes form a large
gene family with 98 members, more or less equally distributed over all five chromosomes, and profilin is a small
gene family with 5 members mapping to three chromosomes. It is probable that, in peach and apple, only a
small fraction of PR-10, TLP and LTP gene members are
relevant to allergenic trait.
A limited number of putative allergen genes may be
expressed in consumed fruits, their expression profiles at
mRNA and protein level are essential to allergenicity. Evidence of cDNA present in the ripe fruit is not sufficient.
The need to qualify and quantify their individual or combined allergenicity is a major challenge for further investigation, where the application of new experimental and
computational tools in genomics and proteomics will be
crucial. Results in this area are starting to emerge and inte-

grate, such as differential expression of LTP 1 (Pru p 3.01)
and LTP2 (Pru p 3.02) [29], the expression studies of Pru
p 3.01 (Pp-LTP1 in two peach genotypes [23], where
major differences were detected in expression at mRNA
and protein accumulation levels between them, and the
research on IgE binding capacity [30], where specific IgEbinding protein regions of Pru p 3 were found for two
types of allergy (OAS and systemic) by the mimotope
mapping technique. Of four Pru p 2 isoallergen genes, a
clone PpAz44 [GenBank: AF362988] matching to Pru p
2.01 was abundantly expressed in ripe peach fruit, while
clone PpAz8 [GenBank:AF362987] (Pru p 2.02) was
undetected by northern blot analysis [24]. Pru p 2.03 and
Pru 2.04 were identified from the fruit ESTs, the latter may
be in large amount of transcript, since 29 ESTs can be
assembled into one consensus gene. A very low level of
Pru p 4 (profilin) was has been identified as pollen-associated allergen, and two isoallergen genes were isolated
from fruit tissue [25]. Different Pru p 1 genes expression
was not reported previously, our preliminary expression
study was performed by means of real-time PCR for six
Pru p 1 isoallergen genes on full ripe fruits of two cultivars. The result showed that the most abundantly
expressed member is Pru p 1.01, followed by Pru p 1.06,
then very low expression level for Pru p 1.04 and -1.05,
while Pru p 1.02 and -03 were hardly detected (data not
shown).

In apple, a very recent comprehensive gene expression of
four classes of putative allergens in apple fruit has gained
insight of the genetic and environmental factors affecting
the allergenic potential of apples [31]. They showed that
some putative members are statistically different in transcript accumulation in ripe fruit, while others were not
detectable. This was a very nice reference to think about
comparative transcription and protein expression for all
set of peach putative allergen genes among diverse peach
cultivars.
We found that the putative genes encoding the major
allergens reported in peach fruit, Pru p 1 and Pru p 3 [15],
were located on two linkage groups, G1 and G6. Based on
their bin map positions, we can use SSR markers tightly
linked or flanking these two major Prunus allergen genes
for a diversity survey of a large number of genotypes to
search for potential candidates for further sequencing of
the allergen genes. Clinical evaluation of allergenicity for
different peach cultivars is needed for association analysis
to find low allergenic alleles.
Comparative mapping between Prunus and Malus using
the sequence and position of allergen genes
Dirlewanger et al. [21] compared the Prunus and apple
genomes using a limited number of common markers.
They found that three Prunus linkage groups (G1, G3 and
G4) were syntenic to seven apple linkage groups, G1 to
LG13 and LG16 at the top and LG8 at the bottom, G3 to
LG9 and LG17, and G4 to LG5 and LG10. Information is
also available on the correspondence between homoeologous linkage groups within the apple genome obtained
initially with RFLPs by Maliepaard et al. [32], to which
various allergen genes and SSRs were recently added by
Gao et al. [17-19] and Celton et al. [33], respectively. With
the availability of genomic sequences and the linkage map
positions of the four allergen-families in apple (26 apple
allergen genes on eight linkage groups) [17-19] and peach
(18 genes on 5 linkage groups, this study), we have additional information useful for updating the synteny
between these two species.

Three of the eight Prunus bins where we located putative
allergen genes corresponded to known syntenic and colinear regions of the apple genome (Figure 3): the Pru p/du 1
on G1, corresponding to regions with clusters of homologous genes (Mal d 1) of apple on LG13 and LG16, Pru p/
du 4.01 on the lower part of G1 and Mal d 4.03 on LG8,
and Pru p/du 2.01A/B on G3 and Mal d 2.01A/B on LG9.
Three more syntenic regions were detected in this study:
Pru p/du 4.02 on G7 and the region of LG2 where Mal d
4.02 maps, Pru p/du 3.01-03 on G6 corresponding to Mal
d 3.01 on LG12 and Mal d 3.02 on LG4; and Pru p/du 4.01
which, in addition to the region of LG8 already mentioned, is syntenic with the upper part of LG15 where Mal

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/543

d 4.03B maps. No counterparts were found to the Pru p/du
2.02, -03, and -04 genes, which were mapped on G7, G8
and G1, respectively, on the apple genome. The positions
of these three genes in the Prunus genome indicate syntenic regions of apple where additional Mal d 2 genes may
be located. Because Mal d 1 on apple LG 13 and LG16 are
clustered in a region of about 2 cM, so we can deduce our
mapped Pru p 1 genes are also in a cluster.
There are two hypotheses on the origin of the two
genomes that generated the apple amphydiploid genome
(2n = 34). One proposes that these were from members of
two Rosaceae subfamilies, one from the Amygdaloideae
(thus closer to Prunus with x = 8) and another from the
Spiraeoideae (x = 9) [34]. The other hypothesis proposes
that both ancestral genomes had a basic chromosome
number of x = 9 at least one being Spiraeoideae (x = 9)
[35]. Combining map position and sequence comparison, the cluster of Pru p 1 genes mapped on Prunus G1 is
more similar to that of the Mal d 1 genes of LG16 than to
LG13: a) Mal d 1 isoallergen genes were classified into
four subfamilies and members of sub-families were distributed asymmetrically to LG 13 and LG16 (Figures 2, 3),
i.e. LG13 contains Mal d 1 members from subfamilies I
and IV, but LG16 contains representative members of the
four subfamilies; b) Pru p 1 genes fall into the four subfamilies as defined in apple, and had a higher deduced
amino acid sequence similarity to the Mal d 1 members on
LG16 (Figure 2 and data of percentage amino acid identity
in the Results section). These results favor the two primitive genomes for apple and one is closer to Prunus than the
other.
Bin mapping feasibility and effectiveness
The bin mapping approach provides a fast and cheap way
to map new genes [26] that has worked very well in our
hands. Once we cloned and sequenced the two putative
alleles for each gene from MB1-73, we either created an
allele-specific marker and genotyped the eight plants of
the bin set, or cloned the fragments from the individuals
of the bin set and sequenced them to determine their genotypes. One of the advantages of using the T × E population for bin mapping is that, due to its inter-specific
nature, polymorphism is very high [26]. The disadvantage
of the bin mapping approach is that there is a loss of precision in marker location (8–25 cM), but this can be
solved for markers of particular interest by running the
whole population to establish a more precise position or
narrow down a region where closely related genes or common RFLP markers in apple has been fine mapped. For
example, we estimate Pru p/du 1 genes (in bin 1:14) are in
a cluster and likely around 13 cM from the top based on
location of Mal d 1 genes and anchor marker MC001 (Figure 3A). A very large number of ESTs from peach fruit are
on public databases. This information is essential to find

candidate genes to be mapped, and their positions compared to that of major genes or quantitative trait loci of
interest mapped using phenotypic data. Bin mapping, as
in this case, can facilitate the positioning of these candidate genes. Exchange of DNA and genotype data of the T
× E bin set in the peach research community is helping
candidate gene mapping, with genetic analysis and breeding applications following on.

Conclusion
Eighteen putative Prunus allergen genes were located on
five of the eight linkage groups of this genus. Genomic
characterization of Prunus allergens provided further evidence for synteny between Prunus and Malus. This information will be directed towards identifying the key genes
or isoforms causing the differences in allergenicity among
different cultivars by additional gene and protein expression and genetic association studies. These results are a
first step towards the understanding of allergenicity
caused by peach fruit and for the development of new cultivars with enhanced health properties and subject to specific recommendations on fruit consumption.

based on these sequences. Preferably, the forward and
reverse primers covered the whole region of the gene
encoding sequences (Table 4). Detailed PCR cloning and
sequencing procedures have been described previously
[19], here we mention only the key points and changes.
First, the melting temperature for amplification was optimized by gradient PCR with hybrid (MB1-73) DNA, then
PCR was performed in two steps with Pfu polymerase
(Stratagene, La Jolla, Calif.) and Taq (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) using an Eppendorf Masterycler. The
amplified fragments were purified by Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Germany), ligated into the pGEM-T easy
vector (Promega, Madison, Wis.) and used to transform
DH5α competent cells (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian,
China) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For each
purified fragment, 6–8 white colonies were selected for
plasmid isolation and sequencing by Invitrogen (Shanghai, China) using an ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif.) platform. If there are more than two
distinct sequences with initial one primer pair, additional
colonies were sequenced to explore new gene members.
All primers were synthesised by Invitrogen (Shanghai,
China).

Methods
Plant materials
PCR cloning and sequencing for targeting allergen genes
to identify different gene members and alleles was mainly
on the 'Texas' (T) almond and 'Earlygold' (E) peach
hybrid (MB1-73) used to generate the reference mapping
population (T × E) and it is now used by the international
Prunus community. Therefore, two putative alleles, one
from 'Texas' (T) and another from 'Earlygold' (E), will be
simultaneously amplified with a pair of primers based on
a reference sequence. For T and E allele-specific marker
tests, DNA from T and E were used as controls. Eight
plants were used for the bin set (the set of plants used for
bin mapping): the grandparent E, the parent MB1-73, and
six plants from the F2 progeny (# 5, 12, 23, 30, 34, 83)
[26]. DNA samples were isolated and provided by IRTA
using standard protocols [36].
PCR primers, cloning and sequencing
Four families of putative allergens from peach and
almond, PR-10 (Bet v 1 homologous gene), TLPs, LTPs
and profilins (PRF), were searched in the GenBank, most
of them were derived from peach fruit tissues. The
sequences obtained were assembled using Seqman program (DNAstar, Lasergene 6) to identify different gene
members for each family. DNA sequences were assumed
to belong to different gene members when they displayed
less than 98% identity. This resulted in four members for
Pru p1 (PR10) and Pru p 2 (TLP), three for Pru p 3 (LTP)
and two members for Pru p 4 (profilin). Primer pairs were
designed using the software program PRIMER DESIGNER
v. 2.0 (Scientific and Educational Software, Cary, N.C.)

Genome walking
Genome walking was applied to gDNA of MB1-73 using
the Universal Genome Walker kit (Clontech, Palo Alto
Calif.) for gene sequences that were not cover the ORF or
to avoid the mistakes induced by primer sequence, or to
explore polymorphisms in the flanking regions. Four
libraries were constructed using Dra I, EcoR V, Pvu II and
Stu I enzymes to digest 2.5 μg of gDNA from MB1-73.
Adaptors were ligated to the digested DNA fragments.
Two gene specific primers (GSP, Table 4) and two adaptors were used for nest PCR. The product from two of the
four libraries was excised from the gel and subsequently
purified, ligated, transformed and sequenced as described
in the above section.
Sequence analysis
DNA sequences were analysed and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified using the SEQMAN
program (Lasergene 6, Madison, Wis.). Intron sizes were
deduced by comparing the genome sequences with cDNA
(ESTs) sequences or by putative conserved splicing patterns in plants. The phylogenetic tree was created and percentage sequence identity calculated using Clustal W by
Megalign (Lasergene 6). The GenDoc program http://
www.psc.edu/biomed/genedoc was used for multiple
DNA and amino acid sequence alignment.
Allele-specific markers and bin mapping approach
Three types of molecular markers were used: 1) two dominant single nucleotide amplification polymorphism
(SNAP) markers [18] representing T and E respectively, 2)

co-dominant markers based on length differences due to
Indels and variation in the number of simple sequence
repeats (SSRs) and 3) SNP markers based on direct
sequencing of the PCR products from 8 bin samples.
Markers 1) and 2) were used for the mapping of Pru p 1,
2, and 4 genes and 3) for Pru p 3 genes.
With SNAP markers, the annealing temperature is usually
critical. It was optimised by gradient PCR using gDNAs of
'Texas' almond and 'Earlygold' peach (the two parents of
MB1-73) as contrasting templates, and then applied to
genomic DNA of 8 bin samples. Indels and SSR markers
were revealed by 6% PAGE and silver staining. For direct
sequencing, after PCR amplification (GoTaq, Promega),
an aliquot of the PCR reaction was loaded on an agarose
gel to check for specific amplification. If the PCR produced a single fragment, the remaining PCR reaction was
purified using Roche High Pure PCR Product purification
kit (Germany). An aliquot of 0.5 μl to 5 μl of purified PCR
was used as template for sequencing with forward and/or
reverse primers. SNPs and/or indels were detected using
Sequencher software, version 4.7.
For mapping, we followed the strategy of "selective" or
"bin" mapping [26,37] where, based on the data of a
detailed map already constructed (in this case the TxE
map), a few plants are selected having a high number of
recombination breakpoints and an approximately even
distribution of these breakpoints throughout the genome.
The joint genotype of these plants for a new marker
defines a single map position, allowing its mapping with
less time and cost, and with a moderate loss of precision
compared with the use of the whole population. For Prunus, a set of only eight plants: one of the parents ('Earlygold') the F1 hybrid (MB1-37) and six plants (# 5, 12, 23,
30, 34 and 83) from the TxE progeny, was selected by
Howad et al. [26] allowing to establish the position of any
marker to 67 fragments of the genome ("bins") of an average size of 7.8 cM. The identification of each bin is unequivocal except for two pairs (2:45/3:04 and 5:41/8:30),
which have an identical genotype and require the genotype of an additional F2 plant (#27) to separate them. By
comparing the genotype appeared in H and E, we were
able to distinguish T allele from that of E. Marker tests
were performed on these eight individuals of the bin set
that were genotyped as homozygous for the 'Texas' allele
(noted as A), homozygous for the 'Earlygold' allele (B) or
heterozygous as MB1-73 (H). The resulting segregation
pattern was compared to the defined data for each bin,
and the matching bin was identified [26].

of the name of the genus, followed by a space and the first
one or two letters of the species name. These letters are
usually followed by a space and an Arabic number according to the order in which the allergens were identified,
whereby the same number is used to designate homologous allergens of related species. Additional numbers and
letters can be added to distinguish different isoallergens
and variants [19]. Accordingly, PR-10, TLP, LTP and PRF
proteins are denoted as Pru p 1 to 4 in peach and Pru du
1 to 4 in almond. Amino acid sequences with more than
5% dissimilarity usually belong to a different isoallergen
and are distinguished by a two-digit code. If there are several genes within isoallergen group (on the DNA sequence
identity, usually more than 95%), they are further distinguished by adding a capital letter after their isoallergen
name, such as Pru p 2.01A and Pru p 2.01B. This procedure has been employed in apple [17] and birch [39]. The
plant material in this study is an interspecies hybrid
between peach and almond; we assigned two alleles of the
same gene locus by its original species source, from Prunus
persica as Pru p and from Prunus dulci as Pru du. Therefore,
Pru p/du refers to a gene in interspecies hybrid parent
MB1-37.
