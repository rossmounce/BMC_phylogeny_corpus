Abstract
Background: The number of vertebrae in pigs varies and is associated with body size. Wild boars have 19
vertebrae, but European commercial breeds for pork production have 20 to 23 vertebrae. We previously identified
two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for number of vertebrae on Sus scrofa chromosomes (SSC) 1 and 7, and reported
that an orphan nuclear receptor, NR6A1, was located at the QTL on SSC1. At the NR6A1 locus, wild boars and Asian
local breed pigs had the wild-type allele and European commercial-breed pigs had an allele associated with
increased numbers of vertebrae (number-increase allele).
Results: Here, we performed a map-based study to define the other QTL, on SSC7, for which we detected genetic
diversity in European commercial breeds. Haplotype analysis with microsatellite markers revealed a 41-kb conserved
region within all the number-increase alleles in the present study. We also developed single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 450-kb region around the QTL and used them for a linkage disequilibrium analysis
and an association study in 199 independent animals. Three haplotype blocks were detected, and SNPs in the 41kb region presented the highest associations with the number of vertebrae. This region encodes an
uncharacterized hypothetical protein that is not a member of any other known gene family. Orthologs appear to
exist not only in mammals but also birds and fish. This gene, which we have named vertnin (VRTN) is a candidate
for the gene associated with variation in vertebral number. In pigs, the number-increase allele was expressed more
abundantly than the wild-type allele in embryos. Among candidate polymorphisms, there is an insertion of a SINE
element (PRE1) into the intron of the Q allele as well as the SNPs in the promoter region.
Conclusions: Genetic diversity of VRTN is the suspected cause of the heterogeneity of the number of vertebrae in
commercial-breed pigs, so the polymorphism information should be directly useful for assessing the genetic ability
of individual animals. The number-increase allele of swine VRTN was suggested to add an additional thoracic
segment to the animal. Functional analysis of VRTN may provide novel findings in the areas of developmental
biology.

Background
In mammals, the vertebral formula shows developmental
constraint [1]. The number of cervical vertebrae is fixed
at 7, and the total number of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae tends to be 19, although the specific counts vary
among species. For example, in the Monotremata, Marsupialia, Lagomorpha, Rodentia, and Artiodactyla, the
total number of thoracic and lumbar vertebrae is conserved at 19, which is thought to be the primitive form.

In comparison, this number is increased in the Perissodactyla (e.g., horse, 24 vertebrae) and Carnivora (e.g.,
dog, 20 vertebrae) and is reduced to 17 in the Primata.
However, these changes are lineage specific, and variation is restricted within each species, as is seen in the
Primata [2].
Wild boars, which are the ancestors of modern
domestic pigs, have 19 vertebrae. In comparison, European commercial breeds have increased numbers ranging from 20 to 23 [3]. These breeds have long been
selectively bred for enlargement of body size in order to
increase meat production and improve reproductive

We first developed 54 microsatellite markers in the 95%
confidence interval (approximately 5 cM, or 9 Mb; Figure 1) of the QTL on SSC7 by using a comparative gene
map for human and pig [13]. We also used swine genome draft sequences, Sscrofa9 published by the International Swine Genome Sequencing Consortium (SGSC;
[14]) for the assignment of the markers to the swine
genome (Additional file 1 Figure S1; Additional file 2
Table S1; Additional file 3 Table S2).
We next evaluated the QTL types of sires and dams in a
closed breeding population of Large White (Awa-York,
AY population) by using half-sib analysis of genotype

performance. This process has presumably increased the
number of vertebrae.
In previous papers on studies of F 2 families, we
reported two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for number
of vertebrae; the loci were found on Sus scrofa chromosomes (SSCs) 1 and 7 [4-6]. These two QTLs acted
independently, and each had a mainly additive effect
(approximately 0.55 and 0.60 per allele, respectively). In
the F2 families, wild boar and Asian local breeds had the
wild-type alleles at both QTLs. All the alleles of European breeds at the QTL on SSC1 increased the number of vertebrae, but only some of the alleles of
European breeds at the QTL on SSC7 increased vertebral number. At the QTL on SSC1, we found a 300-kb
region fixed in a variety of European commercial breeds;
the gene encoding an orphan nuclear receptor/germ cell
nuclear factor (NR6A1/GCNF) was located in this region
[7]. The European allele of NR6A1/GCNF had a nonsynonymous substitution (C®T at nucleotide 748 of
AB248749; Pro192Leu) that led to three times the binding activity to cofactors (NCOR1 and RAP80) as with
the wild-type allele product. However, genetic variation
of NR6A1/GCNF was not detected in today’s commercial-breed pigs, and they have no fewer than 20 vertebrae. Interestingly, the number-increasing-type (Leu-type)
alleles were also detected in some Chinese indigenous
breeds, in which introgression of Western germplasm
has occurred with aim of improving their productivity
and the number of vertebrae has increased [8].
In the current report, we describe our map-based
study of the QTL on SSC7, which was responsible for
the variation in vertebral number in the today’s commercial-breed pigs and may affect many phenotypic
traits. Near the QTL for vertebral number on SSC7,
other QTL effects for body composition [5,6], growth
rate [9,10], and fat deposition [11,12] were also detected.
We expect that our identification of the gene at this
QTL will be of great benefit to the pork production
industry.

Figure 1 Interval mapping of the QTL for number of vertebrae
on SSC7. A QTL analysis was performed in a JD family consisting of
a Duroc sire, five Chinese Jinhua dams, six F1 sires, 21 F1 dams, and
528 F2 progeny. Plots of the F-ratio for interval mapping analysis are
shown. The 95% confidence interval was analyzed with 10,000
repeats of bootstrap samples by QTL Express software and is
indicated in the inset bar graphs. Black bars mean that the regions
were included within 95% of samples. The 95% confidence interval
for this QTL was from 83 cM to 88 cM on SSC7, between markers
SW263 and S0115. In this analysis, a linkage map constructed by
using the JD family was used.

and phenotype data for approximately 1100 progeny.
We found nine heterozygotes that had the wild-type
allele (wt) and the allele associated with increased numbers of vertebrae (number-increase allele, Q). We also
found six homozygotes: five had the number-increase
type (Q/Q) and one had the wild type (wt/wt), as judged
by Z-score test [15] and multiple comparison test (Table 1).
We therefore had 19 Q alleles and 11 wt alleles.
For these 30 alleles in 15 animals, the haplotypes of 57
microsatellite markers, including the 54 novel markers,
were determined within the 95% confidence interval
(Figure 2). We first searched haplotypes of some of the
markers fixed within the 95% confidence interval of the
Q allele, and found that a haplotype of two markers
SJ7106 and SJ7101 was conserved (allele types 1 and 2
in Figure 2). We next searched for identical-by-descent
(IBD) regions distributed in the 95% confidence interval
of both the Q and the wt alleles. Because we considered
these IBD regions to be inconsistent with the phenotypic variation, we excluded them from the candidate
region. In this case, the candidate region was narrowed
between SJ7088 and SJ7040, and contained the two markers SJ7106 and SJ7101 described above and SJ7008
(Figure 2).
For further analysis, nine microsatellite markers
(SJ7113, SJ7139, SJ7136, SJ7126, SJ7121, SJ7114, SJ7099,
SJ7107, and SJ7103) were developed from swine genome
draft sequences, namely BAC clones CH242-92H3 and
CH242-154M12, to which SJ7106, SJ7101, and SJ7008
were assigned (Additional file 2 Table S1); the subsequent analysis revealed that the haplotypes of seven

markers, from SJ7121 to SJ7103, were conserved among
the 19 Q alleles of the AY population (upper red box in
Figure 3). The two markers SJ7106 and SJ7101 were
located in the conserved region.

The swine gene consisted of two exons, as in humans;
the start codon, the acceptor and donor sites of the
intron, and the stop codon in the second exon were
identical to those in humans.

Defining the QTL region by using the parental animals in
F2 families

Association of SNPs with number of vertebrae, and
linkage disequilibrium analysis

Haplotype analysis was performed also with the 11 European-breed pigs used as parents in the F2 families; the
QTL alleles (14 Q and eight wt alleles) of these parents
were characterized in our previous study [6]. For the 14
Q alleles, the haplotypes of six markers from SJ7088 to
SJ7114 were conserved (lower red box in Figure 3).
Only two markers (SJ7121 and SJ7114) were common to
these two sets of conserved haplotypes. The QTL was
therefore judged to be located between the flanking
markers SJ7126 and SJ7099, which were approximately
41 kb apart (Figure 4).
The corresponding region of the human genome
encodes a hypothetical protein, C14orf115. Also, in pigs,
parts of a transcript for the hypothetical protein have
been submitted as expressed sequence tags (ESTs
BE032408.1, BE032606.1, and BF198822.1) and miscRNAs (XR_045716 and XR_045719). We also cloned
the corresponding cDNA (AB550854) from swine
embryos by RT-PCR (Additional file 4 Figure S2).

By using the sequences of the CH242 series of BAC
clones of the SGSC, we analyzed the genomic structure
of the 450-kb region around the QTL and constructed
a provisional gene map (Figure 4; Additional file 5
Table S3). We also developed 26 single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) markers (Figure 5; Additional file
6 Table S4) and used them for a linkage disequilibrium
analysis in 199 independent meat animals produced by
mating Duroc sires and F1 (Landrace and Large White)
dams. For these meat animals, the number of vertebrae
was also scored. Three haplotype blocks were detected,
and six SNPs (NV004, NV015, NV090, NV025, NV035,
and NV062), which were highly associated with each
other (R 2 > 0.98), presented the highest associations
with the number of vertebrae (Figure 5). These SNPs
increased the number of vertebrae with an additive
effect of 0.51 and a dominance effect of 0.04 (calculated from Table 2). The change in vertebral number
occurred in the thoracic vertebrae; differences in the

Figure 2 Haplotype analysis in the 95% confidence interval of the QTL on SSC7 in AY population. Haplotypes of microsatellite markers
were analyzed in the nine sires and six dams in which allele types at the QTL (number-increase-type: Q or wild-type: wt) were determined.
Microsatellite markers were genotyped with sires, dams, and their progeny, and haplotypes were reconstructed. The two homologous
chromosomal regions for each individual are shown arbitrarily as Left (L) or Right (R). Numbers in each marker column represent allele types.
Blocks of the same color are from the same IBD (identical-by-descent) region, which was supported by more than four markers. Italic characters
indicate ambiguous alleles in determination of IBD regions. Blue letters indicate the haplotype of SJ7106 and SJ7101 conserved in the Q alleles.
Red letters indicate distribution in the chromosomal regions of both the Q and the wt alleles. The candidate region contained three markers
(SJ7106, SJ7101, and SJ7008) (white background in header row of table). Letters that are the same at the right of the panel indicate haplotypes
that were identical at all 57 markers.

average number of lumbar vertebrae were not seen
among the QTL types (Table 2). The six SNPs, which
were between SJ7126 and SJ7099, were located from
the promoter region to the second exon of the gene
encoding the hypothetical proteins (Figure 4). These
results strongly suggested that this hypothetical protein
was responsible for the QTL on SSC7 for number of
vertebrae in pigs; we named the encoding gene vertnin
(VRTN).
Polymorphism of the QTL region

Polymorphism analysis of the 41-kb region (AB554652)
between SJ7126 and SJ7099, excluding the PRE1
sequences (swine SINE elements), revealed that only
two haplotypes existed in the AY population, and these
two haplotypes corresponded to the Q and wt alleles
(Table 3). These two haplotypes consisted of 42 polymorphic sites (SNPs and indels), including the six SNPs
mentioned above (Figure 4; Table 3; Additional file 6
Table S4).

We next analyzed the 42 polymorphic sites in the 11
European-breed pigs used as parents of the F2 families
(14 Q and eight wt alleles). All 14 Q alleles had the
same haplotypes as that of the Q allele in the AY population. The same haplotypes (q in Table 3) as those in
the AY population were detected in seven of eight wt
alleles. In the other wt allele, which was in a Landrace
sow, a unique haplotype (q’ in Table 3) was detected
and 33 of the polymorphic sites were identical to those
of the Q allele in the AY population. These 33 were
therefore excluded as candidate polymorphic sites. Of
the remaining candidate polymorphic sites, five were
located in the promoter region, two were in the intron,
and two were in the downstream region of the gene
(Figure 4). Among the nine polymorphisms, six are
SNPs, two are small size of insertion or deletion, and
the other is an insertion of a PRE1 element (291 bp)
into the intron of the Q allele. These polymorphic sites
of VRTN are highly related to the heterogeneity of the
number of vertebrae in commercial-breed pigs, so this

Figure 3 Detailed haplotype analysis in AY population and parent pigs of F2 families. Nine novel microsatellite markers (underlined) were
developed from the sequences of BAC clones, CH242-92H3 and CH242-154M12. These markers were added to the haplotype analysis of the AY
population. In this population, some of the genetic intervals between SJ7059 and SJ7001 had identical haplotypes, and two individuals are
shown for each haplotype: 5901/L and 8502/L for allele types no. 1 to no. 6; 5910/L and 2904/L for allele types no. 8 to no. 11; 1606/L and
9404/R for allele types no. 15 to no. 17; and 2206/L and 5901/R for allele types no. 22 to no. 29. Numbering is the same as in Figure 3.
Haplotype analysis was also performed in the parent pigs of the F2 families of our previous study, in which the QTL types of the parent pigs had
been determined (Lower part). Numbers in each marker column are the sizes of alleles as amplified DNA fragments (in bp). Red boxes indicate
conserved regions detected in the 95% confidence interval for the number-increase (Q) allele in the AY population and in the parent pigs of the
F2 families. Markers common to the two conserved regions are indicated in red letters (i.e. SJ7121 and SJ7114). The QTL was likely to be located
between the flanking markers (SJ7126 and SJ7099). Breeds are: W, Large White; L, Landrace; B, Berkshire; D, Duroc. Family AY is the Awa-York
population and the others are F2 families constructed with a Japanese wild boar and two Landrace females (LWb), a Landrace male and two
Meishan females (ML), a Meishan male and a Landrace female (LM), a Large White male and a Meishan female (MW), a Large White male and a
Jinhua female (JW), a Clawn miniature male and a Berkshire female (BC), a Duroc male and five Jinhua females (JD), and a Japanese wild boar
and three Large White females (WWb).

Expression of VRTN gene in swine embryos

We examined the promoter activities of the swine
VRTN gene by using mouse ES cells (P19 and CGR8)
but found no difference between the Q and wt alleles
(data not shown). We detected the transcripts of mouse
VRTN by RT-PCR at embryonic days 6 to 10.5 (data not
shown) and also tried to detect the transcripts of VRTN
in swine embryos. For this analysis, we prepared

heterozygous embryos by mating between Q and wt
homozygotes, as judged by the haplotypes of NV024,
NV107, and NV062. At five embryonic stages–days 8.0,
8.5, 10.0, 12.0, and 14.0 postcoitus–embryos were collected from the uterus and RT-PCR was performed with
RNA from total embryos. Amplifications were detected
similarly through these periods. The PCR products were
TA-cloned and SNPs were typed by a sequence-based
method for each stage (Additional file 7 Figure S3). In
two samples at day 8.0, only 1.1% and 3.5% of clones
were derived from the wt allele; the majority were from

Figure 4 Genomic structure of the QTL region for number of vertebrae. A. BAC clones used for swine genome sequencing by the
International Swine Genome Sequencing Consortium. B. Gene map and microsatellite markers. In humans, VRTN has been submitted to public
databases as C14orf115 encoding a hypothetical protein. Small triangles indicate positions of microsatellite markers. Double-headed arrows show
conserved regions. For the 19 Q alleles of the Large White population (AY population), the haplotypes at seven markers from SJ7121 to SJ7103
were conserved. For the 14 Q alleles in the F2 families, the haplotypes at six markers from SJ7088 to SJ7114 were conserved. C. The QTL interval
defined by haplotype analyses with microsatellite markers. The VRTN gene consisted of two exons (boxes) and was located in this interval. The
shadowed box is the coding region. White triangles indicate positions of microsatellite markers and black triangles indicate polymorphic
sequence-tagged sites (STSs). Numbers in parentheses are numbers of polymorphic sites at each STS. A total of 42 polymorphic sites, which
formed two major haplotypes in the AY population, were present. Candidate sites are boxed. Information on polymorphisms is given in Table 3.
The sequence of this region was submitted to GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ as AB554652.

the Q allele (Table 4). By day 8.5, the proportion of
clones from the wt allele had increased to 33.0% and
50.3%, and by day 10.0 similar numbers of clones were
derived from the Q and wt alleles. By days 12 and 14 all
of the clones were from the Q allele. These results
showed that regulation of expression of the Q allele
changed with the embryonic stage, and that the Q allele
was expressed more abundantly than the wt allele.

Discussion
To map the QTL on SSC7, we used the allele type in the
QTL (Q or wt), not the phenotype (vertebral number: 20,
21, 22, or 23). By using half-sib analysis with approximately 1100 progeny animals, we defined the 30 alleles of
15 parent animals. The amount of data seems small, but
it is worthwhile because it is qualitative, not quantitative.
These 15 animals were from a closed breeding population, the AY population. This population was derived

from 10 sires and 65 dams as founder individuals and
was bred for seven generations (1987 to 1993), in which
average daily gain and backfat thickness were major
objectives of breeding but not the number of vertebrae.
After 1993, the population was maintained with 10 sires
and 35 dams. We think that a large degree of recombination was accumulated in this population, making the
population favorable for IBD analysis. On the other hand,
unrelated individuals were used as the founders, and we
expected that the Q alleles of some of these pigs would
have common sequences in a limited region near the
QTL, enabling high resolution for fine mapping similar
to those used in association studies.
We started fine mapping of the QTL over a region of
approximately 9 Mb to give a 95% confidence interval in
the QTL analysis. In the first step of haplotype analysis
for the 19 Q and 11 wt alleles (Figure 2), the candidate
region was fortunately narrowed to approximately 300 kb

Figure 5 Association of SNPs with vertebral number, and linkage disequilibrium analysis. In the 450-kb region around the QTL, SNPs were
developed and were genotyped by using 199 independent meat animals, for which the numbers of vertebrae were scored. The associations
between SNPs and numbers of vertebrae are presented, with F-values. Linkage disequilibrium was analyzed by using Haploview software, and
the R2 values are presented in the boxes. For the two gray intervals in the graph, SNPs (minor allele frequency > 0.01) were not detected in our
DNA samples from European breed pigs.

(between SJ7088 and SJ7040), but a conserved region
contained only two markers in the 19 Q alleles. The
second step of the analysis, using densely located markers, revealed the conserved region with seven markers
(no more than 200 kb) in the Q alleles of the AY
population.
In our previous study [6], we characterized the QTL
alleles of parental pigs in the F2 families, and we used
these animals for further analysis. The 14 Q alleles of
these pigs (five Landrace, two Berkshire, two Duroc and
five Large White) presented a conserved haplotype
from SJ7088 to SJ7114. As a final mapping result, the

candidate region for the QTL was an approximately
41-kb region between SJ7126 and SJ7099, which
included the common haplotype within all the Q alleles
in the present study.
The result of the fine mapping was confirmed by linkage disequilibrium analysis and an association study in
independent meat animals produced with Duroc sires
and F 1 (Landrace × Large White) dams. The 41-kb
region was included in a haplotype block, and the SNPs
developed in this region were highly associated with the
number of vertebrae. We therefore concluded that the
QTL was located in the 41-kb region.

cDNA covering the putative open reading frame from
the swine embryos and we named it vertnin (VRTN) as
the gene responsible for the QTL for vertebral number
in pigs. A domain search of the swine homolog
(C14orf115) in Ensemble (http://uswest.ensembl.org/
index.html) revealed that it had a similar motif to the
helix-turn-helix domain of Transposase IS3/IS911 [16].
Although this domain is reported to be unique to bacteria, vertnin is expected to have DNA-binding activities.

(GFP)-fused vertnin protein was expressed in the nuclei
of cultured cells (Additional file 8 Figure S4). The QTL
on SSC7 in this study affected the number of thoracic
vertebrae but not the number of lumbar vertebrae,
whereas the QTL on SSC1 affected the numbers of both
thoracic and lumbar vertebrae [6]. This evidence suggested that the number-increase allele of swine VRTN
added an additional thoracic segment in the animal. We
suspect that the expression pattern of Hox genes (e.g.
Hoxa-9 or Hoxc-9, which are expressed in the terminal
region of the thoracic segment and more posterior portion of mouse embryos; [17,18]) could be altered. A series of genome sequencing projects (funded by National
Human Genome Research Institute; http://genome.gov/)
suggested that orthologs exist not only in other mammals but also in birds and fish, and encode conserved
proteins (Additional file 9 Figure S5). Vertnin is therefore likely to be an essential factor for development of
the embryo in a wide range of organisms. Its functional
analysis may provide novel findings in the areas of
developmental biology (e.g., somitogenesis or morphogenesis), so we are planning to perform a functional
analysis with model organisms such as the mouse or
chicken.
Polymorphism analysis of the 41-kb region showed
that the AY population had only two haplotypes (Q and
q), which consisted of 42 polymorphic sites. Another
haplotype (q’) was detected in the wt allele of a Landrace sow, in which the q’ allele had no significant effect
(calculated as 0.05) and the other allele (Q) increased
0.55 of vertebral number [6]. In our preliminary study it
was also found in the sequence of the BAC clone
L261J7 [19] (Additional file 2 Table S1). There were
nine candidate polymorphic sites, and they were highly
associated with each other in European commercialbreed pigs. We cannot define the causative polymorphic
sites genetically, but these nine sites were associated
with the number of vertebrae in commercial-breed pigs,
and this information will be useful for genetic diagnosis
in breeding populations.
In the swine VRTN gene, we found one nonsynonymous substitution, NV064 (G®A at nucleotide 1247 of
AB550854; Gly365Asp), but it was excluded from the
candidate sites because the same nucleotide G was
located in the Q and q’ alleles (Table 3). We detected a
change in the transcription of VRTN with changes in
embryonic stage. It is possible that this change in
expression with stage is the origin of the QTL. Among
the polymorphisms of the swine VRTN gene, an insertion of a PRE1 element (one of the swine SINE elements) into the intron of the Q allele, along with the
SNPs in the promoter region, may be a cause of the
changes in expression of this allele with embryonic
stage. In mouse organogenesis, expression of some

Page 9 of 13

genes is regulated by a mechanism that includes the
activation of a SINE B2 repeat [20]. In this case, the
SINE B2 acts as a boundary between the heterochromatin and euchromatin, partly by the activation of pol III
and pol II RNA polymerase. In another case, SINE elements have been reported to act as enhancer elements,
as is the case with the FGF8 gene [21]. In the swine
VRTN gene, transcripts around the PRE1 element were
detected on the Q allele by RT-PCR in our preliminary
study (data not shown). To further explore the causative
mutation as well as the biological changes induced by it,
we are using molecular biological techniques to study
the regulation of swine VRTN expression.

Conclusions
Genetic diversity of VRTN is the suspected cause of the
heterogeneity of number of vertebrae in commercialbreed pigs associated with SSC7, so the polymorphism
information should be directly useful for assessing the
genetic ability of individual animals. We expect that our
identification of the VRTN gene will be of great benefit
to the pork production industry. The number-increase
allele of swine VRTN affected the vertebral formula,
especially in the thoracic segment. The functional analysis of VRTN may provide novel findings in the areas of
developmental biology.
Methods
Animals

DNA samples and data for number of vertebrae came
from a Large White population (named Awa-York, AY)
at the Livestock Research Institute of Tokushima Prefecture in Japan. ("Awa” is the old name for Tokushima
Prefecture.) This population was derived from 10 sires
and 65 dams as founder individuals and was bred as a
closed population for seven generations (1987 to 1993),
with eight to 11 sires and 28 to 36 dams. The population was then maintained with 10 sires and 35 dams.
The population in this study contained some individuals
that had been used in our previous study [6].
We also used DNA samples from European-breed parent pigs of the F2 families from our previous study [6].
These families were produced by crossing a Landrace
male with two Meishan females (ML), a Japanese wild
boar with two Landrace females (LWb), a Large White
male with a Jinhua female (JW), a Clawn miniature [22]
male with a Berkshire female (BC), a Large White male
with a Meishan female (MW), a Meishan male with a
Landrace female (LM), a Duroc male with five Jinhua
females (JD), and a Japanese wild boar with three Large
White females derived from the Awa-York population
(WWb; [23]).
DNA samples from the 199 meat animals independently obtained from Chiba Prefecture, Japan, were

Mikawa et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:5
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/5

prepared from the skin after slaughter; the numbers of
vertebrae were also scored. These meat animals had
been produced by mating Duroc sires to F 1 dams of
Landrace and Large White.
Scanning for QTL on SSC7 for number of vertebrae

A QTL scan on SSC7 was performed for number of vertebrae in the Jinhua × Duroc cross population (JD
family). An interval mapping based on the least-squares
method developed for an outbred population [24] was
used. The 95% confidence intervals for the QTL on
SSC7 were obtained by bootstrap analysis of 10,000
repetitions with QTL Express software [25,26]. In this
analysis, a linkage map constructed with the JD family
was used.
Isolation of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones
and development of microsatellite markers

A comparative map between pig and human [13]
showed that the QTL region of SSC7 corresponds to a
region on human chromosome 14. Swine sequence
tagged sites (STSs) were developed from swine ESTs or
swine genomic sequences, which were obtained by
BLAST searches with human gene sequences (Additional file 2 Table S1). BAC clones [19] were screened
with these swine STSs, and microsatellite sequences
were isolated from the BAC clones by using a direct
sequencing method reported previously [27]. Recently,
the SGSC has made progress in swine genome sequencing [14]. The sequences of the microsatellite markers
were assigned in the swine genome draft sequence,
Sscrofa9 assembly as well as the BAC clones (CH242serieas) for the sequencing.
Half-sib analysis on SSC7 for number of vertebrae in a
Large White population

We scored the number of vertebrae in 1338 individuals
produced from a Large White population (AY population). The numbers of vertebrae were 20 (<1%), 21
(33%), 22 (64%), and 23 (3%). Using the microsatellite
markers SW147 (90.1 cM on the MARC map; [28]),
SW252 (99.4 cM), and S0115 (102.2 cM), which were
located on SSC7 near the QTL for number of vertebrae,
we genotyped the 1338 progeny as well as their 19 sires
and 69 dams. Haplotypes consisting of these three
microsatellite markers on each homologous chromosome were reconstructed by using the genotype data of
the sires, the dams, and their progeny. Among the 1338
progeny, 1122 were classified into two groups on the
basis of the haplotype inherited from their sire or dam.
We compared the average numbers of vertebrae in the
two groups of progeny for each sire or each dam
and used t-tests to evaluate the significance of the
differences. Sires and dams were considered to be

Page 10 of 13

heterozygous (Q/wt) at the QTL when significant differences (P < 0.01) were detected. Moreover, to detect sires
and dams homozygous for the QTL, we performed Ztests in accordance with the method of Nezer et al. [15].
The Q-to-wt substitution effect was set at 0.49, which
was derived from the value 0.49 ± 0.10 calculated from
nine heterozygotes in the AY population. Sires and
dams were judged to be homozygous when Z < -2.0.
QTL types of homozygotes (Q/Q or wt/wt) were judged
by Tukey’s multiple comparison of the average number
of vertebrae of each progeny group with those (Q: 21.92
and wt: 21.43) of the total groups of Q and wt alleles
inherited by the progeny (371 and 382, respectively).
QTL types of homozygotes were confirmed by comparison of the haplotypes of 57 markers in the 95% confidence interval with those of heterozygotes (Table 1).
Reconstruction of the haplotypes of the 57 markers is
described below.
Haplotype analysis of high-density microsatellite markers
in the 95% confidence interval of the QTL for number of
vertebrae on SSC7

For the sires and dams of the AY population and for the
parent pigs of the F2 families, haplotypes of 57 microsatellite markers in the 95% confidence interval (approximately 5 cM, 9 Mb) of the QTL on SSC7 were
analyzed. Haplotypes of the markers were reconstructed
by using genotype data on the sires, dams, and their
progeny: samples of one sire, one dam, and six progeny
were used for each full-sib family. For IBD identification,
the haplotypes of their progenitor animals were determined and recombination sites were analyzed. IBD
regions supported by more than four markers were
shown in Figures 2 and 3.
Structure analysis of the swine genomic region around
the QTL for number of vertebrae

In the QTL region on SSC7, we found some errors in
the Sscrofa9 assembly. The sequence of BAC clone
CH242-92H3 (Figure 4) was inserted inversely between
those of CH242-238O9 and CH242-154M12 without
overlapped sequences, and some regions were duplicated
(SJ7088, SJ7106, SJ7101, SJ7008 in additional file 2 Table
S1). Then we constructed the gene map again. With the
sequences of the BAC clones CH242-31K24, CH242238O9, CH242-92H3, CH242-154M12, and CH242313I6, BLAST searches were performed against the
human genome sequence. Sequence information on the
genes in the human homologous region was used for
the construction of a provisional gene map (Additional
file 5 Table S3). In each gene, exons were estimated
with the human gene sequence or swine mRNA
sequences. The gt-ag rule was confirmed for each
intron. For the swine VRTN gene, RT-PCR was

Mikawa et al. BMC Genetics 2011, 12:5
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/12/5

performed with three sets of primer pairs-sVRTN 1, 5’agacggtccatgctcaatg-3’ and 5’-tgcagtgctccaggtacaac-3’;
sVRTN 2, 5’-aggaggtggaggctgaaagt-3’ and 5’-actcaggtccctgaccctct-3’; and sVRTN 3, 5’-cagcttctgttggggaaaag-3’ and 5’-ctgtggggtccagaacagat-3’-in the genomic
sequence corresponding to the human C14orf115
sequence (Additional file 4 Figure S2).
Association of SNPs with number of vertebrae, and
linkage disequilibrium analysis around the QTL region

PCR primers were designed on the basis of the
sequences of the BAC clones of the SGSC, and SNPs
were developed from eight samples of DNA from meat
animals produced by the mating of Duroc sires and F1
dams of Landrace and Large White (Additional file 6
Table S4; Figure 5). SNPs were genotyped for 199 independent samples from meat animals, for which the
numbers of vertebrae were scored. Analysis of variance
was performed for each SNP. Linkage disequilibrium
was analyzed in the same 199 meat animals by using
Haploview software [29]; the R2 values are shown in Figure 5.
Polymorphism analysis of swine VRTN gene

Polymorphism analysis for the approximately 41-kb
region between microsatellite markers SJ7126 and
SJ7099 was performed in the AY population. DNA samples from sires 3605 (Q/Q), 5002 (Q/Q), 1606 (Q/wt),
and 5901 (Q/wt), and from dam 2206 (wt/wt) of the AY
population (Table 1) were used. Sequences were determined by application of a series of PCR and direct
sequencing methods to each sample. Polymorphic sites
segregating between the Q and wt alleles, except for
those in PRE1 elements, are shown in Figure 4 and
Table 3. These polymorphic sites were elucidated by
using other DNA samples from the AY population and
the parent pigs of the F2 families, for which QTL types
were determined. A haplotype that we found in a Landrace female and considered to be a wt allele is also presented in Table 3.
Expression analysis of VRTN in swine embryos

Heterozygous embryos were prepared by reciprocal matings of Q and wt homozygotes, which were determined
by the haplotypes of NV024, NV107, and NV062 in the
swine VRTN gene. At five embryonic stages–days 8.0,
8.5, 10.0, 12.0, and 14.0 postcoitus–embryos were collected from the uterus after slaughter. RNA was prepared with Trizol (Invitrogen) and RT-PCR was
performed with PCR primers for NV062 (Additional file
7 Figure S3). Amplified DNA fragments were cloned by
using a TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), and two
SNPs in NV062, which was located in the second exon,
were genotyped from 96 clones in each stage by direct-

Page 11 of 13

sequencing of PCR fragments from the inserts. On each
of days 8.0 and 8.5, five embryos were taken together as
one sample and RNA was prepared. At the other stages
postcoitus, RNA was prepared separately from each
embryo. At each of days 8.0 and 8.5, two samples were
from reciprocal matings. At day 10, one embryo was
from a cross between a wt/wt male and a Q/Q female,
and two were from a reciprocal cross. At day 12,
embryos were from a cross between a wt/wt male and a
Q/Q female. At day 14, embryos were from a cross
between a Q/Q male and a wt/wt female.
