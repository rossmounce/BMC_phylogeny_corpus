Abstract
Background: Marek’s disease (MD) is an economically important viral disease of chickens caused by Marek’s
disease virus (MDV), an oncogenic herpesvirus. This disease was well controlled since the widespread use of
commercial vaccines, but field MDVs have shown continuous increasing in virulence and acquired the ability to
overcome the immune response induced by vaccines. Nowadays, MD continues to be a serious threat to poultry
industry, isolation and characterization of MDVs are essential for monitoring changes of viruses and evaluating the
effectiveness of existing vaccines.
Results: Between 2008 and 2010, 18 field MDV strains were isolated from vaccinated chicken flocks in Sichuan
province, China. Three oncogenic genes including Meq, pp38 and vIL-8 genes of the 18 isolates were amplified
and sequenced. Homology analysis showed that the deduced amino acid sequences of these three genes exhibit
95.0-98.8%, 99.3-100% and 97.0-98.5% homology respectively with these of other reference strains published in
GenBank. Alignment analysis of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences showed that four amino acid
mutations in Meq gene and two amino acid mutations in vIL-8 gene displayed perfect regularity in MDVs
circulating in China, which could be considered as features of field MDVs prevalent in recent years in China. In
addition, one amino acid mutation in pp38 gene can be considered as a feature of virulent MDVs from USA, and
three amino acid mutations in Meq gene were identified and unique in very virulent plus (vv+) MDVs.
Phylogenetic analysis based on Meq and vIL-8 protein sequences revealed that field MDVs in China evolved
independently. Virulence studies showed that CVI988 could provide efficient protection against the field MDVs
epidemic recently in China.
Conclusions: This study and other published data in the GenBank have demonstrated the features of Meq, pp38
and vIL-8 genes of MDVs circulating in recent years in Sichuan, China. Mutations, deletions or insertions were
observed in these three genes, and some mutations could be considered as the unique marks of the MDVs
circulating presently in China. The paper supplies some valuable information concerning the evolution of MDV
which is useful for the vaccine development and control of MD in China.

Background
Marek’s disease virus (MDV) is an oncogenic cellassociated a-herpesvirus that causes lymphoproliferative
disease in the domestic chickens resulting in T-cell lymphomas in visceral organs and peripheral nerves as early
as 3-4 weeks postinfection, the pathogenesis of MD has

recently been reviewed in detail [1,2]. Early events
involve lytic infection of B-cells followed by latent infection and oncogenic transformation of T-cells [3,4].
Transformed T-cells then infiltrate lymphoid tissues,
peripheral nerves and visceral organs, usually leading to
stunting and death of affected birds.
MDV strains (MDVs) have been classified into three
serotypes that have major differences not only in the
genome but also in the biological features. Serotype 1
MDVs includes all the oncogenic strains and their

attenuated forms; serotype 2 are non-oncogenic viruses
isolated in chickens; and serotype 3 are non-oncogenic
virus isolated in turkeys, generally known as herpesvirus
of turkeys or HVT [5]. Among those three serotypes,
only serotype 1 are oncogenic, which can be further
classified into four pathotypes including mild (m), virulent (v), very virulent (vv) to very virulent plus (vv+)
strains [6-8]. MD was first described by Josef Marek in
1907 as a polyneuritis affecting mainly old chickens with
low morbidity and negligible mortality, but acute MD
became the predominant form in most countries that
had a well-developed poultry industry in 1960 s. After
the introduction and widespread use of HVT vaccines,
the disease was then well controlled. During the 1970 s,
there was a decrease in the efficiency of HVT vaccine
due to interference from homologous maternal antibodies and the emergence of MDV field strains of
increased virulence. In the mid-1980 s, a bivalent vaccine (a mixture of HVT and the serotype 2 strain SB-1)
was introduced, and this provided better protection than
either of the individual components used alone [9], a
phenomenon known as protective synergism. With
further increase in virulence of field viruses [7], the “Rispens” vaccine (attenuated serotype 1 strain CVI988)
[10,11] was introduced for widespread use in the 1990 s.
Recently, some reports have showed the failure of Rispens vaccine in Europe, when used either alone or in
combination with MDV-2 and/or -3 vaccines, suggesting
the emergence of hypervirulent strains [12,13].
To update, the molecular mechanism for MDV oncogenicity and pathogenicity remain largely unknown.
Moreover, virus-encoded factors contributing to the
enhanced virulence of MDV field strains remain uncharacterized. Several genes unique for MDVs have been
identified [14-17], including latency associated transcripts (LATs), Meq (Marek’s EcoQ), vIL-8, viral lipase,
pp38/pp24, the 1.8 kb gene family, telomerase RNA
(vTR) and MDV-encoded microRNAs [18]. Some of
these genes are present only in serotype 1, and others
may have homologues in MDV serotype 2 and/or HVT.
Among those genes, Meq, pp38 and vIL-8 genes were
reported to have the greatest possibility to be associated
with viral oncogenicity and pathogenicity. Therefore,
isolation of filed MDVs and sequence analysis of these
genes can help us decipher the molecular characters of
field MDVs epidemic recently in China.
In recent years, isolation and sequence analysis of
MDVs in China were frequently reported in breeder or
layer flocks which had been vaccinated by HVT or
CVI988, all results showed that there are virulent MDVs
circulated in China [19,20]. In several of these reports,
the incidence rate of MD could reach up to 15%-60%.
However, the nature of MDVs circulated in Sichuan was
not clear. In this paper, 18 MDVs were isolated in

Page 2 of 11

Sichuan from clinical outbreaks that occurred in the
period of 2008-2010, then the Meq, pp38 and vIL-8
genes of the isolates were sequenced and aligned, and
phylogenetic analysis together with other published
isolates was carried out. In addition, challenge test to
10-day-old SPF chickens was also performed to test the
efficacy of MDV vaccines used commercially now. This
study could provide useful information as to the nature
of MDVs circulating in China, and the significance of
this study in MDV prevention was also discussed.

Methods
Samples collection and MDV detection by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)

563 heparinized blood samples were collected from 23
chicken farms in Sichuan province of China, those
farms were located in eight area of Sichuan, which are
Chengdu, Luoshan, Mianyang, Deyang, Meishan, Ya’an,
Xinjin and Ganzi. The DNA was extracted from blood
by routine phenol-chloroform method and used as temples for PCR. The target gene of PCR was 132 bp
repeated sequence of MDV-1 genome, which can distinguish field MDV strain from vaccine CVI988 strain. The
sequences of the primers used for this purpose were R1:
5’-ATG CGA TGA AAG TGC TAT GGA G-3’ and R2:
5’-ATC CCT ATG AGA AAG CGC TTG A-3’ reported
by Zhang et al [20]. Blood samples that contain two or
three copies of 132 bp repeats by PCR were used for
MDV isolation.
Virus isolation

The lymphocytes were separated from the positive blood
samples by lymphocyte separation medium (Tianjin
Haoyang Biological Manufacture Co., Ltd), and were
inoculated into primary duck embryo fibroblast (DEF)
cells prepared from 11-day-old embryonated eggs, and
incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for five days for each
passage. After two blind passages, the existence of MDV
in DEFs was verified by PCR detection of 132 bp
repeated sequence. Only the positive samples having
no contamination of Avian Leukosis virus (ALV) and
Reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) by PCR (Primers
sequences were not shown) were used for further passages until the appearance of typical cytopathic effect
between 48 and 144 h after inoculation. One representative MDV strain originated from a chicken farm was
stored for further research.
Primer for Meq, pp38 and vIL-8 genes

Three pairs of primers was designed on the basis of the
DNA sequence of MDV-1 strain published in GenBank
with the aid of computer software Primer Premier
5.0 (PREMIER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA, USA)
(Table 1), primers were synthesized by Takara biotechnology

(Dalian, China) Co., Ltd. The anticipated amplification segments for Meq, pp38 and vIL-8 were 1081 bp, 1006 bp and
887 bp long, respectively.
PCR amplification of oncogenic genes

Total DNA was extracted from DEFs using a sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) - proteinase K and phenol/chloroform protocol [21]. The concentration of DNA was
adjusted to 1 μg/ml in water and stored at -20°C for
further use. PCR amplification was carried out using 2
ul DNA as template in a total volume of 50 ul containing 25 ul 2× Taq PCR Mixture (TIANGEN, Beijing,
China), 2 ul of 10 uM of each of the two primers, and
19 ul ddH2O. The optimum conditions for PCR of Meq
and vIL-8 genes were as follows: 94°C for 4 min, 35
cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 56°C for 1 min, 72°C for
1.5 min, and final elongation at 72°C for 10 min. The
optimum conditions for PCR of pp38 gene were as follows: 94°C for 4 min, 35 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, 60°C
for 1 min, 72°C for 1.5 min, and final elongation at 72°C
for 10 min. The PCR product was analyzed in 0.9%
agarose in Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer gel containing 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide.
DNA cloning

Products of PCR reactions, corresponding to the predicted
size of the target gene, were isolated from agarose gels and
purified using E.Z.N.A.TM Gel Extraction Kit (Omega,
USA). Purified PCR products were ligated with a TA cloning vector pMD19-T (TaKaRa, Japan) and transforming
into DH5a Escherichia coli. (E. coli.) competent cell. Confirmation of clones containing recombinant plasmid was
achieved by PCR and restriction enzyme (RE) digestion.
The recombinant plasmid was sequenced by Sanggon Biotech (Shanghai, China) Co., Ltd.
Sequence analysis of oncogenic genes

The obtained nucleotide sequences and the deduced
amino acid sequences of oncogenic genes of MDV isolates were edited using the Editseq program in the
Lasergene package (DNASTAR Inc, Madison, WI, USA),
and compared with other reference MDVs for the
homology analysis with the use of MegAlign program in
the same package. Phylogenetic analysis of the amino
acid sequences of Meq, pp38 and vIL-8 genes were performed with the neighbor-joining method using MEGA
version 4.0. The bootstrap values were determined from

1000 replicates of the original data. 18 other MDV reference strains were chosen for comparison, including
0093, 0095, 0297, 0304, G2, GX070060, GX070060,
GXY2, YLO40920, 3004, 814, CVI988, CU-2, GA, Md5,
RB1B, 648A, and 584A. Of these, three strains were vaccine strains, nine strains were isolated from China and
six strains were isolated from USA. Among these 18
reference strains, eighteen strains were used for comparison of Meq genes, six strains were used for comparison
of pp38 genes and seven strains were used for comparison of vIL-8 genes. The MDV reference strains were
retrieved from the GenBank database, and the backgrounds of the reference strains used in this study are
listed in Table 2.
Virulence studies

In order to study the pathogenecity of MDVs isolated
in Sichuan, one representative MDV isolates, LS strain,
was used as challenge strain. 90 SPF chickens were
randomly divided into three groups, 30 birds in HVT
immunized group were vaccinated with 2000 PFU
HVTs of FC126 strain (Harbin Weike Biotechnology
Developmengt Co., Ltd.), 30 birds in CVI988 immunized group were vaccinated with 4000 PFU MDVs of
CVI988/Rispens strain (Beijing Lingyu Biotechnology
Co., Ltd.) and 30 birds in control group were inoculated with phosphate buffer (PBS) at the age of one
day. All the birds in the same group were held solely
in biosafety level 2 (BSL2) isolators in separate rooms
with adlibitum access to feed and water and maintained under uniform standard management conditions, and inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 0.5 ml
diluent of DEFs containing 4000 PFU LS MDVs at the
age of ten days. Clinical signs and gross postmortem
lesions as well as mortalities were recorded for a period of 60 days after virus challenge. SPSS 17.0 software
was used to evaluate the data and determine the significant difference of the rate of tumor occurrences and
mortality between the immune group and control
group. Besides, organs of dead chickens in control
group, such as liver, spleen, kidney, were sampled for
histopathological diagnosis.

145 blood samples were positive by PCR containing two
or three copies of 132 bp-repeats, the positive detection
rate reached 25.8%.
Virus isolation

18 representative MDV typical strains were isolated
from 18 of 23 chicken farms by using DEFs culturing,
PCR detection showed that the 18 MDVs were free of
ALV and REV. The isolated MDVs adapted to DEFs
very well and could cause typical cytopathic effect (CPE)
after 4-6 blind passages. The MDVs isolated from other
five chicken farms were discarded because of the contamination of ALV or REV. The case histories of local
strains are listed in Table 3.
Copy numbers of 132-bp repeats in 18 field MDVs

The copy numbers of 132 bp repeats in the genome of
field isolates were examined, the length of one copy of
132-bp repeats is 182 bp long, containing one 132-bp
repeat and 50 nucleotides from primers, the length of
two copies of 132 bp repeats are 314 bp, and the length
of three copies of 132 bp repeats are 446 bp by analogy.
In 18 field MDVs, the YA strain is the only one containing three copies of 132 bp repeats, the other isolates
containing two copies (Figure 1-A).
Results of PCR amplification of Meq, pp38 and vIL-8
genes

The total DNA of DEFs infected by field MDVs was
extracted to be used as PCR template, and the complete
sequence of Meq, pp38 and vIL-8 genes of 18 field

MDVs was successfully amplified (Figure 1-B, C and
1D).
High nucleotides and amino acids identities of Meq, pp38
and vIL-8 genes between isolated MDVs and other
reference MDVs

Meq, pp38 and vIL-8 gene sequences of the 18 MDV
isolates were delineated and submitted to the GenBank
database (Table 3).
Homology analysis of Meq gene showed that the
homology of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid
sequences of the 18 Sichuan isolates were 99.7-100.0%
and 99.1-100.0%, respectively, and were 98.2-100% and
97.1-100% between MDVs from Sichuan and these from
other areas of China, but were 97.7-99.6% and 95.098.8% between MDVs from China and those from other
countries.
For pp38 gene, the homology of the nucleotide and
deduced amino acid sequences of the 18 Sichuan isolates were 99.7-100.0% and 99.3-100.0%, respectively,
and were 99.4-100% and 99.3-100% between MDVs
from Sichuan and those from other countries. However,
no sequences of pp38 gene of MDVs isolated in other
areas of China are available in GenBank now.
As for the vIL-8 gene, the homology of the nucleotide
and deduced amino acid sequences of the 18 isolates
were 99.5-100.0% and 98.5-100.0%, respectively, and
were 99.0-99.5% and 97.0-98.5% between MDVs from
Sichuan and those from other countries. However, no
sequences of vIL-18 gene of MDV isolated in other
areas of China are available in GenBank now.

Alignment analysis of nucleotide and deduced amino acid
sequences of Meq, pp38 and vIL-8 genes

Alignment analysis of Meq complete nucleotide and
deduced amino acid sequences of the 18 isolates and 18
published MDVs were performed. Nucleotide mutations,
insertions, and/or deletions were observed when GA
strain was used as reference strain. The amino acid

mutation in the Meq gene of MDVs displayed regularity
at nine positions, including 71, 77, 80, 115, 119, 139,
153, 176 and 217, and amino acid mutations at position
80, 115, 139 and 176 occurred in most field MDVs from
China. The amino acid mutations at positions 119, 153
and 176 were unique in very virulence plus (vv+) strains
from USA 684A and 584A. Besides, a 59aa insertion

was also observed in the Meq gene of vaccine or mild
virulent strains between position 192 and 193 of virulent
strains (numbering using amino acid sequence of GA as
reference) (Figure 2A).
As for pp38 gene, the complete nucleotide sequences
and deduced amino acid sequences of 18 isolates were
compared with these of other 6 reference MDVs, and
the results showed that the mutation displayed regularity at position 81(C®G) and 327(A®G) (Figure 2B-1),
resulting in a nonsense amino acid mutation at position
27 (glycine), and a sense amino acid mutation at position 109 (glutamate ® glycine) of virulent MDVs from
USA (Figure 2B-2).
As for vIL-8 gene, the complete nucleotide sequences
and deduced amino acid sequences of 18 isolates were
compared with these of other 7 reference MDVs, and
the results showed that mutation at position 11(T ® C)
and 92 (A ® G) (Figure 2C-1) were common in 18 isolates, resulting in two amino acid mutations at position
4 (leucine ® serine) and 31 (aspartate ® glycine) of
MDVs from China (Figure 2C-2).

sequences of Meq, pp38 and vIL-8 genes

Phylogenetic analysis on the Meq and vIL-8 sequences
of 18 isolates and other 18 reference strains showed that
the analyzed 36 MDVs could be separated two groups
(cluster 1 and cluster 2), 18 MDVs isolated from
Sichuan and other virulent MDVs from China were
included in cluster 1; while, vaccine strains, mild virulent strains and virulent strains from USA were included
in cluster 2 (Figure 3A, C). In addition, for the phylogenetic tree of Meq gene, the MDVs in cluster 2 could be
further grouped into 2 branches, virulent strain from
USA were included in one branch; while, vaccine strains
or mild virulent strains were included in another branch
(Figure 3A). No obvious cluster or branch was observed
in the phylogenetic tree of pp38 gene (Figure 3B).
Virulence studies

No clinical sign was observed during the first two week
post challenge. Chickens become depressed and comatose since two weeks post challenge in HVT immune
group and control group, and some infected chickens
may also exhibit flaccid neck paralysis; while no obvious
clinical sign was observed in CVI988 immunized group.
The earliest death appeared on 18 days post challenge in
control group, and 21 days post challenge in HVT immunized group. The peak of death came on 3 weeks post
challenge in control group, but 4 weeks post challenge in
HVT immunized group. Lymphomas occurred in a variety of organs and tissues after postmortem examination,
especially in the lung and heart (Figure 4-A). The rate of
tumor occurrences and mortality were 80.00% and

76.67% in control group, while 76.67% and 70.00% in
HVT immunized group. The difference of the rate of
tumor occurrences and the mortality between the HVT
immunized group and control group were not significant
(P > 0.05). In addition, there was no death or tumor
occurrence in chicken of CVI988 immunized group during the experiment period.
Histopathological observation of infected SPF chicken

Histopathologic slices showed that multimorphous and
immature lymphocytes infiltrated and proliferated in
almost all kinds of organs, including cardiac muscle,
hepatic lobule, skeletal muscle, lung, spleen, ovary, kidney, bursa of fabricius and glandular stomach mucosa.
Most histiocytes of the digestive system showed swell,
degeneration, necrosis and almost all the structure was
completely destroyed (Figure 4-B).

Discussion
Marek’s disease (MD) is currently one of the important
contagious diseases in poultry industry. It not only
causes the death of birds directly, but also causes immunosuppression of infected chickens which are more sensitive to other pathogens such as E. coli. Although
CVI988 vaccine [10] is widely used now in China, but
immune failure still occurred in some flocks. It had
been reported that the virulence of MDV isolates have
increased in the last four decades [7], and some of the
recent isolates are more pathogenic for chickens than
MDVs isolated before [22]. The emergence of MDVs of
increasing virulence is a significant problem for the
poultry industry.
MDV is a member of the genus Mardivirus that consists of serotypes 1 and 2 (MDV-1 and MDV-2) as well
as serotype 3 or herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) [23].
Among them, the only serotype 1 is oncogenic, and
some of the unique genes such as Meq (MDV EcoRI-Q)
[24], pp38 [25], vIL-8 (viral interleukin-8) [26] were
reported to be associated with viral oncogenicity and
pathogencity.
In this study, homology comparison of the nucleotide
and deduced amino acid sequences of Meq, pp38 and
vIL-8 of 18 isolates and other reference strains were
conducted, and high nucleotides and amino acids identities of these three genes between isolated MDVs and
other reference MDVs were observed, indicating that
the genetic stability of these three genes was high in
recent years. Currently, Meq gene is most likely considered to be the factor to induce tumors. It encodes 339
amino acids and contains a basic leucine zipper (bZIP)
domain at the N terminal closely resembling the jun/fos
oncogene family [24], and its transactivation can lead to
cell transformation [27,28]. The length of Meq gene of
JM, CU-2 and CVI988 was 177bp longer than these of

virulent MDVs [29,30], which result in a 59 aa insertion.
It is reported to have a suppressive effect on the Meq
expression [31]. After sequence alignment, this insertion
was also found in Chinese vaccine 814 and Russian vaccine strains 3004, but not found in all 18 field isolates.
In addition, it had been reported previously that amino
acid change at position 71 (serine ® alanine) and 77
(glutamate ® lysine) was the feature of high virulent
MDVs [32]. In this study, the same mutation at position
71 was also observed in all wild strains from China, but
the mutation at position 77 was not observed in field
isolates from China, and this mutation seemed to be a
feature of virulent MDVs from USA. Besides, it was also
found that some amino acid mutations at position 80,
115, 139 and 176 in most isolates from China displayed
perfect regularity. Mutation at position 80 (aspartate ®
tyrosine), 115 (valine ® alanine), 139 (threonine ® alanine), and 176 (proline ® arginine) accounted for 96.3%

(26/27), 100% (27/27), 90.0% (24/27) and 96.3% (26/27)
of all field MDVs (not including vaccine 814 strain)
from China, respectively. The mutation in position 80,
115, 139, 176 of Meq protein could be used as virulent
genetic characteristics of the circulating MDVs MDV in
China. Moreover, it was observed that the three amino
acids at position 119 (arginine), 153 (glutamine) and 176
(alanine) were unique in very virulence plus (vv+)
strains 684A and 584A, but we can not determine that
whether this is the character of all vv+ MDVs.
pp38 codes a 38Ku phosphoprotein and plays a role in
viral reactivation in latent period [33,34] and cell transformation [35,36]. Minor differences in amino acid sequences
of different MDVs have been observed for pp38. Originally, it was believed that pp38 was not expressed in
CVI988 [37]; however, it was showed to be present in
CVl988 later, and glutamine in position 107 was replaced
by arginine as defined by monoclonal antibody (MAb)

anatomical change, “a” to “e” were heart, lung, liver, stomachus glandularis, intestinal tract, respectively, and tumors were observed in these
tissues, even in the intestinal tract and mesenterium; B. Diagnosis by histopathologic slices (HE 400×). All tissues were fixed in 10% formalin
paraffin and embedded, and 5 μm sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE), for light microscopy, “f” to “n” refer to bursa of
fabricius, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, ovary, spleen, kidney, glandular stomach mucosa, cardiac muscle. Arrows show that multimorphology
lymphocytes infiltrated patically and formed tumors (h, i, m, n), and other organs were infiltrated by lymphocytes extensively and their
organizations were completely destroyed (f, g, j, k, i).

H19 [38,39]. In this study, after alignment of the amino
acid sequence of pp38 gene of 25 MDVs, it was found that
no mutation at position 107 was observed in all the field
isolates, but glutamate at position 109 in virulent MDVs
(GA, RB1B, 584A and 648A) from USA were replaced by
Glycine in field isolates from China. So the mutation (Glutamate ® glycine) in position 109 can be considered as a
feature of virulent MDVs isolated from USA.

The vIL-8 gene locates in the long repeat region and
was originally identified as a spliced Meq variant [40].
This gene consists of 3 exons and is expressed during
cytolytic infection. vIL-8 attracts T cells, especially after
vIL-8 receptors are up-regulated by interferon-g (lFN-g).
vIL-8 may be important for the switch of infection from
B to T lymphocytes [41]. This gene was very conservative in 648A, RB1B, MD11 and GA strains [42], but

Tian et al. Virology Journal 2011, 8:121
http://www.virologyj.com/content/8/1/121

after comparison of the amino acid sequence, two special point mutations at position 4 (leucine® serine) and
31 (aspartate ® glycine) were found only in the field
MDVs from China. We speculate that the point mutations at position 4 and 31 could be considered as the
features of field MDVs in China.
Phylogenetic tree, based on the Meq and vIL-8 amino
acid sequences, revealed that the field MDVs from
China formed an independent cluster, while vaccine
strains, mild virulent MDVs and virulent MDVs from
USA formed another cluster. In addition, in the phylogenetic tree of Meq, the MDVs in the latter cluster
could be further divided into two different branches.
This result implied that field MDVs from China may
evolve independently, and genetic difference of MDVs
displayed in phylogenetic tree of the Meq was more
obvious than these of vIL-8 and pp38 gene. Meq gene
could be a gene of priority for Phylogenetic analysis.
Virulence study in this study revealed that virulent
MDVs prevalent in China in recent years could break
through the protection provided by HVT vaccine. Histopathologic diagnosis of the diseased chicken showed
multimorphous and immature lymphocytes infiltrated
and proliferated in all kinds of organs, leading to complete destruction of the structure of organs and tissues.
CVI988/Rispens vaccine is a better choice for immunization. Currently, MD occasionally occurred in some
chicken farms immunized with CVI988 vaccines in
China; however, result of virus isolation and virulence
test did not show that the very virulence plus (vv+)
strain, such as 684A in USA, was epidemic in China,
and the immune failure may be due to the improper
selection of vaccines and the incorrect way of
vaccination.
In conclusion, high nucleotides and amino acids identities of Meq, pp38 and vIL-8 genes between 18 MDV isolates and other reference MDVs was observed. Four
mutations at position 80, 115, 139 and 176 of the amino
acid sequence of Meq gene, two mutations at position 4
and 31 of the amino acid sequence of vIL-8 gene can be
considered as main features of field MDVs prevalent in
recent years in China; one mutation at position 109 in
amino acid sequence of pp38 gene can be considered as a
feature of virulent MDVs isolated from USA. Phylogenetic analysis of Meq genes could provide the evolution
difference of different MDVs. CVI988/Rispens vaccine
could provide enough protection against the challenge of
prevalent MDVs, and should be widely used commercially. Nevertheless, as new variant strains may emerge in
the future, constant surveillance of new filed MDVs is
necessary to reveal the character of epidemic MDVs and
to develop better vaccines and control program of MD.
