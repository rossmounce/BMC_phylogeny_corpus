Abstract
Background: The study of biological interaction networks is a central theme of systems biology.
Here, we investigate the relationships between two distinct types of interaction networks: the
metabolic pathway map and the protein-protein interaction network (PIN). It has long been
established that successive enzymatic steps are often catalyzed by physically interacting proteins
forming permanent or transient multi-enzymes complexes. Inspecting high-throughput PIN data, it
was shown recently that, indeed, enzymes involved in successive reactions are generally more likely
to interact than other protein pairs. In our study, we expanded this line of research to include
comparisons of the underlying respective network topologies as well as to investigate whether the
spatial organization of enzyme interactions correlates with metabolic efficiency.
Results: Analyzing yeast data, we detected long-range correlations between shortest paths
between proteins in both network types suggesting a mutual correspondence of both network
architectures. We discovered that the organizing principles of physical interactions between
metabolic enzymes differ from the general PIN of all proteins. While physical interactions between
proteins are generally dissortative, enzyme interactions were observed to be assortative. Thus,
enzymes frequently interact with other enzymes of similar rather than different degree. Enzymes
carrying high flux loads are more likely to physically interact than enzymes with lower metabolic
throughput. In particular, enzymes associated with catabolic pathways as well as enzymes involved
in the biosynthesis of complex molecules were found to exhibit high degrees of physical clustering.
Single proteins were identified that connect major components of the cellular metabolism and may
thus be essential for the structural integrity of several biosynthetic systems.
Conclusion: Our results reveal topological equivalences between the protein interaction network
and the metabolic pathway network. Evolved protein interactions may contribute significantly
towards increasing the efficiency of metabolic processes by permitting higher metabolic fluxes.
Thus, our results shed further light on the unifying principles shaping the evolution of both the
functional (metabolic) as well as the physical interaction network.

Background
To ensure stable and efficient of metabolic processes in
cells, highly coordinated molecular interactions of the

involved enzymes and metabolites are necessary. The
study of spatially organizing principles of metabolic pathways has long been a research focus of cellular and molecPage 1 of 20

ular biology. Organelle compartmentalization and the
organization of enzymatic pathways in so-called metabolons have been discussed as the main cellular-scale as well
as molecular-scale organizational units to orchestrate the
multiple metabolic processes inside cells and to separate
as well as to integrate them in space and time. First introduced by Srere, the term metabolon describes a non-covalent association of several sequential enzymes involved
in a metabolic pathway [1]. Similar to industrial assembly
lines, intermediates are passed on from one enzyme to the
next, referred to as metabolic channeling, leading to an
optimized metabolic flux. The stability and structural
integrity of metabolons varies greatly ranging from temporary associations and their dynamic formation in
response to environmental changes to stable, permanent
enzyme complexes [2,3]. Furthermore, it was found that
enzyme complexes are often associated with intra-cellular
membrane systems [4-6] demonstrating that the spatial
organization of the metabolic network is not only limited
to direct physical interaction of participating enzymes, but
that it also involves passive – in the context of enzymatic
pathways – mediating structural cellular components.
Metabolic channeling provides several advantages such as
an increase of catalytic efficiency by shorter transition
times between the consecutive active sites [7,8], local
enrichment of substrates, protection from toxic intermediates by shielding them from the cellular environment,
prevention of decomposition of unstable chemical compounds [9], overcoming of thermodynamically unfavorable equilibria [10-12], as well as avoidance of competitive
pathways [1,13-17]. Although the concept of metabolic
channeling has been discussed controversially at times
[5], it is now supported by metabolic control analysis as
well as experimental evidence [5,18-23].
Recently, Huthmacher and co-workers analyzed the metabolic networks of yeast and Escherichia coli in the context
of direct protein interactions as observed in newly available, large-scale protein-protein interaction surveys allowing a systematic scan for direct protein interactions of
consecutive metabolic pathway enzymes [24,25]. They
found higher frequencies of physical interactions of
enzymes sharing at least one common metabolite in the
network. The chance for enzymes to physically interact
was observed to be negatively correlated to the distance
between enzymes in metabolic network in E. coli and, to a
lesser degree, in yeast as well. In addition, they reported a
higher probability of regulating enzymes to interact with
other proteins, where regulating enzymes were defined
either by a threshold of Gibbs free energy change of the
associated reaction or by their position within the network as being located at highly connecting branching
points. Furthermore, the analysis of high-throughput protein-protein interaction data yielded a number of novel

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/2/100

candidates for metabolic channeling. Thus, the functional
significance of protein-protein interactions for the metabolic pathway organization has been established and is
supported by many experimental observations.
Here, we aim to expand the view on protein interactions
in the context of metabolic pathways by treating both levels of molecular organization as network graphs and to
investigate global as well as local network properties. The
representation of complex biological networks as graphs
and the study of their properties have contributed to an
emerging system-wide approach towards studying the
organizing principles of cellular and molecular processes.
Global topological graph properties such as the degree
distribution have received particular attention and have
been discussed in the context of network stability and
information exchange within networks [26-31].
The integrated analysis of different network types for different levels or domains of molecular organization has
been applied to transfer evidence to support particular
interactions from one network type to another. Ge et al.
showed that gene expression and protein interaction data
are correlated [32]. Kemmeren and co-workers as well as
Deane et al. used gene expression data to assess confidence levels for protein interaction networks [33,34].
Goldberg and Roth predicted genetic interactions by utilizing protein interaction data [35], and Kelly and Ideker
to predict the physical context of genes [36]. Rhodes et al.
used GO-annotations, integrated interlogs and expression
data as well as data of protein domains, known to interact
to predict protein interactions [37]. The use of gene coexpression data to identify protein interactions has also
been demonstrated recently [38]. Finally, Lee et al. integrated expression, gene-fusion, phylogenetic profile, literature co-citation as well as protein interaction data to
predict functional associations [39].
In this study, we expand on the study of Huthmacher and
co-workers by investigating the entire protein interaction
network and its significance for metabolic networks and
metabolic pathways. We extended enzymatic physical
interactions to also include non-enzymatic proteins as
metabolic relationships between enzymes may also be
mediated by metabolically inactive interface proteins.
Specifically, we investigate whether large-scale topological
equivalences of both the metabolomic and protein interaction network can be detected. Furthermore, as the physical organization of metabolic pathways is likely to have
been under evolutionary optimization to increase metabolic throughput, we are studying here whether available
flux data can be correlated to the protein interaction data
supporting this hypothesis. So far, protein interaction
data have been analyzed primarily across all functional
categories. Here, we compare the general organization

principles with those observed for the enzymatic protein
subset, and report that, indeed, specific differences do
exist. The significance of topological parameter distributions have largely been analyzed within the context of the
examined network type itself, but not across different network types. For example, Macdonald and co-workers discovered defined relationship between fluxes going
through metabolic network edges and the degree product
of the connected nodes [40]. Here, we explore whether
such relationships can be established across network
types, in particular protein interaction and metabolic networks.
Thus, our investigations aim to establish whether unifying
principles shaping the evolution of both protein interactions as well as metabolic pathways can be detected.

Results
Topological Properties of Interaction Networks
We start our investigations by first characterizing the global network properties of the various types of molecular
networks examined in this study. Besides the two main
network types, the protein interaction network and the
metabolic network, further filtering and different construction methodologies were applied to reveal organizational differences between raw networks including all
interactions, and networks designed specifically to capture aspects of metabolism and to also safe-guard against
possible artifacts resulting from a particular reconstruction scheme.
Protein Interaction Networks (PIN)
The raw PIN (rPIN, see Methods) derived from the merged
databases of DIP and BIOgrid comprises 5,438 proteins
involved in 39,766 physical interactions. The network
does not differentiate whether the interaction between
two proteins is transient or permanent, or under which
conditions the proteins were found to interact, or the
functional relevance of the association. As the PINs used
in this study are represented as undirected graphs, the
functionality of an interaction cannot be resolved. A
kinase interacting with a protease may activate the protease or be degraded by it.

The connectivity distribution P(k) of the rPIN can be
approximated by a power-law function with P(k) ≈ k-γ,
where γ – the scale-free exponent – is the slope of the linear regression line in the double-logarithmic diagrams
(Figure 1A). The value of γ was observed as 1.6 for the
rPIN. The deviation from a straight line in the double-logarithmic suggests that a better fit may be obtained by
introducing a mixture of power law and exponential
degree distribution as was observed similarly for the Drosophila protein interactome [41] and other molecular networks [42-45]. As is typical for biological networks, the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/2/100

great majority of proteins show a small number of links
whereas few proteins have up to 330 interactions. The
rPIN network graph is characterized by a relatively short
characteristic length (CL) of 3.49 ± 0.01. Of the 39,766
physical interactions, 15,232 occurred in the cytosol, 58
between two membrane associated proteins, and 298
were interactions between a membrane associated protein
and a soluble protein. The sub-cellular localization information of 16,739 interactions was incomplete. GO-cellular component annotations for 7,439 interactions were
inconsistent; i.e. participating proteins were reported in
different compartments, and have thus been discarded
from the analysis.
To analyze aspects of the protein interaction network that
are specifically associated with metabolic functions, we
identified proteins of rather non-metabolic functions and
processes and their associated interactions. The rPIN comprises 1,186 proteins related to DNA processing functions
with 21,952 associated interactions, 297 protein-degradation related proteins involved in 4,999 interactions, and
267 kinase-phosphatase associated proteins with 8,251
associations as well as 2,300 other-non-metabolic rather
unspecific proteins involved in 34,230 interactions. All
these interactions were partially overlapping as proteins
form different groups were also reported to interact. After
removing these interactions, the remaining nodes span a
graph of 1,517 proteins, which can be considered to be
the key molecular components responsible for maintaining the metabolic machinery. We will refer to this graph as
the filtered PIN (fPIN). Of the 1,517 proteins, 522 represent enzymes annotated with an EC-number. The fPIN
comprises 1,086 links, with 289 interactions between
enzyme pairs. One third of all nodes are included in the
graphs giant component, the largest connected sub-graph.
We left unconnected nodes in the graph as the absence of
interactions of such proteins may also be significant. In
comparison to the raw network, the number of enzymes
(869 in the rPIN) is lower, because in the fPIN, non-metabolic enzymes such as protein kinases and protein phosphatases have been excluded.
Further removal of proteins not assigned to at least one
EC-number led to the enzyme-only-PIN (ePIN), a graph
comprising only enzymes and the interactions between
them. Its giant component contains 19% of all nodes.
Thus, with applied filtering, the PIN became progressively
disintegrated.
As observed for the rPIN, and even more convincingly, the
connectivity distribution of both networks, the fPIN and
ePIN, follows a power law behavior with respective scalefree exponents of 2.0 for the fPIN, and 1.6 for the ePIN
(Figure 1A). Compared to the rPIN and explained by the
removal of many non-specific interactions, the fraction of

highly-connected nodes is reduced in the fPIN and ePIN
with a simultaneous increase of unconnected nodes. The
characteristic length (CL) of the fPIN is 8.16 and for the
ePIN 6.22, which is approximately twice as long as the CL
associated with rPIN (3.49) suggesting that, in particular,
highly connected nodes providing shortcuts have been
removed in the fPIN and ePIN compared to the rPIN even
though the networks as such are smaller as nodes have
been deleted. Note that impossible paths (no connection
between nodes) have not been included in the calculation
of CL.
The average cluster coefficient of the rPIN was determined
as 0.16, 0.39 for the fPIN, and 0.41 for the ePIN indicating
increased modularity of the two filtered PINs compared to
the raw protein interaction network. While the rPIN
shows a negative correlation of degrees associated with
neighboring nodes, i.e. it is dissortative, the fPIN and the
ePIN revealed a positive correlation. The assortativity (rd)
was calculated as -0.11 for the rPIN, 0.15 for the fPIN, and
0.16 for the ePIN. All correlations are significant with
associated p-values of 1.0E-101, 1.0E-6, and 0.005,
respectively. The negative correlations in the rPIN can be
explained by the high dissortativity of protein sub-networks that have been discarded in the filtered PINs. The
graph comprising relations between kinase-phosphatase

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/2/100

associated proteins shows a dissortativity of -0.36, DNArelated proteins of -0.12, protein-degradation -0.26 and
other-non-metabolic proteins of -0.22. Consistent with
these findings, the distribution of the neighbors' connectivity increases with increasing connectivity of nodes for
the fPIN and ePIN, albeit moderately – yet significantly,
and decreases for the rPIN with increasing degree of nodes
(Figure 2A).
Thus, the organizing principles governing protein interactions between proteins involved in metabolic functions
appear to be different than for other functional categories.
While PINs generally are dissortative, protein interactions
associated with metabolic functions appear to be assortative; i.e. enzymes preferentially interact with other
enzymes of similar degree (connectivity).
The Metabolic Interaction Networks (MIN)
We analyzed three different realizations of metabolic
interaction networks (MIN) each representing metabolic
pathways from a different perspective. The first two representations of a metabolic interaction networks are the
Enzyme Interaction Networks (EIN) and the EIN derived
from KEGG pathway maps (mapEIN), where the nodes of
the graph are enzymes with assigned EC-numbers. In the
EIN, two enzymes are linked if they are associated by at

ePIN as 2 as EIN, (B) (NC) as a function of
Neighbors' Connectivity (NC) as a function of connectivity of the respective reference node for the (A) rPIN,
fPIN and only ePIN as well as EIN, (B) mapEIN, and (C) CIN. Plotted points correspond to mean values at a particular
connectivity value. Linear regression analysis applied to the raw NC-connectivity value pairs yielded for the rPIN (Pearson correlation coefficient, r, and associated p-value, p): r = -0.10, p = 9.7E-15; fPIN: r = 0.16, p = 7.1E-6; ePIN: r = 0.21, p = 1.3E-3;
EIN: r = 0.70, p = 0; mapEIN: r = 0.47, p = 2.6E-109; and CIN: r = 0.08, p = 1.9E-7. Note: the number of raw values per plotted
mean value decreases rapidly with increasing connectivity. Thus, the apparent cluster of points in the rPIN near connectivity
values near 100 is not statistically significant.

least one product-substrate relationship. For constructing
the mapEIN, we extracted relations from KEGG pathway
maps directly rather than scanning reaction lists for product-substrate relationships as done for the EIN. While the
EIN comprises a large number of enzymes and their relations, the mapEIN may capture better the established biochemical knowledge of metabolic pathways. The
Compound (Metabolite) Interaction Network (CIN) represents a third representation of MINs. In this graph,
nodes are metabolites, and links are drawn between them
if they are connected by at least one reaction.
The EIN comprises 3,435 nodes representing unique ECnumbers. The connectivity distributions, P(k), of the
graph follows approximately a scale-free distribution with
an estimated scale-free exponent γ of 1.8 (Figure 1B). As
observed for the rPIN, a deviation from a simple power
law behavior is evident (see above). However, the distribution follows a power law only if small ubiquitously
occurring, so-called currency metabolites, such as H+,
NH3, H2O, CO2, and metal ions as well as co-enzymes
and co-substrates, like CoA, NADH+, FAD, SAM are
excluded (Figure 1D). Including these compounds significantly increases the degree of the enzymes interacting
with them resulting in a distribution P(k) deviating from
the power law distribution for high connectivity values
(Figure 1D). Upon including currency metabolites, the
total number of edges increases from 60,622 to 140,260
and characteristic length, CL, decreases from 3.64 to 3.00.
The mapEIN comprises 1,957 nodes connected by 6,395
relations. The scale-free exponent of the connectivity distribution, γ, was computed as 1.2 with an increased probability of nodes to be less connected as compared to the
EIN, where many more relationships between enzymes
are possible simply via their possible substrate-product
relationships. The CL of the mapEIN network was determined as 6.62.
The third representation, the CIN, comprises 3,702
metabolites connected by 4,868 links. As done for the

EIN, the currency metabolites, co-enzymes and co-substrates have been removed prior to analysis. The connectivity distribution of the CIN exhibits a scale-free
exponent, γ, of 2.4 and CL of 12.3 (Figure 1C).
All three MIN graphs are assortative with assortativity values, rd, of 0.43, 0.26, and 0.09 in the EIN, mapEIN, and
CIN, respectively. Correspondingly, an increasing neighbors connectivity, NC(k), was observed for increasing
connectivity, k (Figure 2B, C). The high assortativity value
for the EIN probably results from the construction procedure. The EIN was constructed by scanning for productsubstrate relationships. As reactions are generally treated
as reversible, so that the lists of substrate and products are
interchangeable, all enzymes sharing a metabolite may be
linked through substrate-product relations and form a
complete sub-graph. While the high assortativity of the
EIN may originate from the reconstruction method possibly resulting in too many connections, this may not be the
case for the mapEIN as the interactions have been curated
manually. However, many reactions in the KEGG-maps
are known to be performed by isoenzymes carrying different EC numbers. Since reactions are treated as reversible,
isoenzymes will be considered connected as the product
of one isoenzyme can be the substrate of another, even
though it is the same reaction they are catalyzing. Thus, a
set of isoenzymes will form a fully-connected sub-graph,
also including the enzymes of the preceding or subsequent reaction step as each isoenzyme is connected to
them. The reconstruction of the CIN avoids this problem.
This third representation of MINs is closest to the biological and intuitive understanding of metabolic pathways. A
pathway in this sense is the path from a first substrate to a
final product. The difference in the respective construction methods is also reflected by the average clustering
coefficient (CC), where the CC for EIN was 0.67, EIN from
KEGG-Maps 0.47, and 0.06 for the CIN, respectively.
A summary of global network properties for the PINs and
MINs investigated in this study is provided in Table 1.

Correlation of protein interaction networks (PINs) and associated
metabolic interaction networks (MINs)
Nodes in the EIN and mapEIN represent enzymes. It is
therefore possible to link enzymes found in PINs to the
EIN and mapEIN via their annotated EC-numbers.
Enzymes from PINs can be linked to metabolites from the
CIN network via the enzyme (EC-number)-substrates and
-product relationships. Thus, it is possible to directly
relate network distances of proteins (enzymes) across
both network types (PINs and MINs) allowing us to study,
how metabolic network or pathway distances are reflected
in protein interaction networks.

We evaluated the distribution of the shortest paths
between distance pairs in the PINs and MINs, comparing
the actually observed distribution to distributions generated by 1,000 randomly constructed networks (see Methods). The over- or under-representation of the distances
were judged by the z-score of observed frequencies (Figure
3, raw frequency counts are available in the Additional
File 1). We applied the analysis to all PINs and related
them to the EIN, the mapEIN, and the CIN.
A direct correspondence between the protein interaction
networks and metabolic networks; i.e. the physical organization of enzyme interactions follows directly their reaction pathway network, would be reflected by red-colored
squares – indicating increased occurrence compared to
random expectation – along the diagonal in the pair-distance matrices shown in Figure 3. Indeed, the distributions of the enrichments and depletions of the distancepairs reveal an overall correlation of the shortest paths in
PINs and MINs. All PINs show a strong enrichment of
direct interactions; i.e. distance 1, in relation to the EIN
and mapEIN. Furthermore, an overall correlation of distance pairs with increased numbers of observations relative to the random background (red squares along the
diagonal, blue squares primarily off-diagonally) for all
PIN-MIN comparisons is evident, especially for the fPIN
(Figure 3, central column). Interestingly, enzymes appear
more closely related (shorter distances between them) in
the fPIN in comparison to their distances derived from
their metabolic network association (mapEIN and CIN),
as the off-diagonal pattern of red-colored squares indicates a skewed distribution towards larger shortest paths
between linked proteins in the MIN compared to their distances in PINs. Thus, it appears that enzymes catalyzing
enzymatic steps of some medium distance, i.e. not directly
subsequent to each other, are physically brought into contact via protein-protein interactions involving proteins
that are not necessarily directly participating in the actual
metabolic pathway. For the EIN, above-diagonal enrichments were not observed when compared to the fPIN and
ePIN, possibly a consequence of the network reconstruction procedure that allows very many interactions leading

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/2/100

to a highly connected metabolic network. As the fPIN contains both enzymes and structural proteins, some proteins
included in this network may function as connector or
bridging proteins holding distant parts of metabolic pathways together. In the ePIN, such proteins have been filtered out leaving only enzymes in the PIN. Here, the
enrichment pattern follows the main diagonal, but at
weaker significance as the absolute numbers are smaller.
A direct comparison of shortest paths between enzyme
pairs connected via valid paths in both the fPIN and the
ePIN yielded a mean distances of 5.3 for the fPIN, and 6.2
for the ePIN (p = 0; paired, two-tailed t-test, N = 5,531).
Thus, metabolic enzymes are brought into spatial proximity – by way of protein-protein interactions – via interactions mediated by non-metabolically active proteins.
The overall Pearson correlation values, r, for distancepairs (PIN, MIN) are listed in Table 2. All correlations are
highly significant (p < 1.0E-40). Thus, in all comparisons,
a positive correlation of the organization of protein-protein relations was observed between their enzymatic pathway organization and their corresponding physical
organization. The correlation is strongest when enzymeonly protein networks are compared to MINs, in particular to KEGG-map derived metabolic pathways (mapEIN).
The PIN-MIN correlations were observed to become more
pronounced when more relevant (with regard to metabolism) PINs were considered and increase steadily from
rPIN to fPIN, with greatest correlations observed for the
ePIN. Thus, it is no contradiction that the correlations for
the rPIN are low, but a result, because many unspecific
interactions included in the rPIN were eliminated in the
other PINs. The reported correlation coefficients (Table 2)
were computed over the entire range of network distances
including distant pairs for which correlations can be
expected to be low. Correspondingly, correlation values
increased significantly when remote pairs were discarded
(Additional File 2).
The correlation of metabolic fluxes carried by enzymes and their
Protein Interaction Network properties
On the basis of measured relative metabolite flux rates of
yeast growing in a glucose medium, we evaluated the correlation of network cluster coefficients of the involved
enzymes in PINs to the flux rate carried by the enzymes.
The flux rates were estimated by Blank and colleagues
based on a global metabolic network model of S. cerevisae
[46] and a flux balance analysis based on large-scale 13Cisotope tracer experiments [47]. Our analysis revealed
high PIN clustering coefficients for high flux enzymes
decreasing with the decrease of the relative flux rates (Figure 4). Further analysis revealed that the connectivity as
well as the betweenness centrality are also positively correlated with the flux rates carried by the associated
enzymes (Table 3). Thus, highly connected and central

enzymes (in PINs) are enzymes carrying high fluxes. Furthermore, enzymes preferentially interact with enzymes of
similar flux rates. A strong positive correlation of flux rates
of physically interacting proteins was observed (correlation coefficient of 0.52) in the fPIN and ePIN.

Physical interactions in high-throughput catabolic pathways and
synthesis pathways of complex metabolites
To gain further insight, we studied the physical organization of enzymes carrying high fluxes in greater detail. The
large-scale flux analysis in yeast by Blank and co-workers
[47] comprised 1,038 reactions (745 distinct reactions)
encoded by 672 genes of which 610 can be found in the
rPIN. Of the distinct reactions, 28% (208 reactions) have

Pearson correlation coefficient, r, and associated p-values between connectivity (degree), centrality as judged by betweenness of enzymes (nodes in
PINs) and the respective relative flux rates, as well as the correlation coefficient of the relative flux rates between neighboring (physically
interacting) enzymes in the three PINs examined in this study.
*Correlation coefficient, r, differs in rPIN from values obtained in fPIN and ePIN, because enzyme pairs are included in the rPIN that were filtered
out in the other two PINs because of inconsistent subcellular localization annotation. They are identical for the fPIN and ePIN as the two networks
contain the same set of enzymes.

ture conditions, pyruvate may either be fully degraded to
CO2 by the enzymes of the TCA-cycle within the aerobic
glycolysis, where the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) connects glycolysis with the TCA-cycle enzymes, or to ethanol
by pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) within the fermentative glycolysis, when O2
is limiting. The enzymes of the fermentative glycolysis are
highly interconnected with each other with many physical
interactions detected between the associated enzymes
(Figure 5B). An exception is the pyruvate kinase (PYK1,
CDC19) which is not physically linked to any of the other
enzymes of the pathway, as well as the 6-phosphofructokinase (PFK). Instead, PYK interacts with PDH.
Only a minor fraction of pyruvate (flux rate of 6 relative
to the glucose uptake rate flux rate set to 100) appears to
be channeled to the TCA-cycle, that is 3% (as one glucose
molecules may lead to the formation of two pyruvate molecules) of the initial glucose influx is processed by the
TCA-cycle enzymes. The production of pre-stage substrates of amino acids rather than energy production is the
main function of the TCA-cycle. The flux rates decrease to
1 beyond the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) reaction
step. This path leads through the PYK1, PDH and the following enzymes of the TCA-cycle: citrate synthase (CIT),
isocitrate deyhdrogenase (IDH), 2-oxoglutarate complex
(KGD), succinlyCoA synthetase (LSC) and SDH. The
enzymes of the TCA exhibit a relatively low number of
physical interactions (Figure 5C). The interactions are
mainly pooled in enzyme complexes, SDH (SDH1/2/3,
TCM62), the LSC (LSC1/2) and KGD (KGD1/2, LPD1),
performing the individual reactions steps of the TCAcycle. Only the reactions of the malate dehydrogenase
(MDH1) and the CIT are physically connected. However,
taking the prior reactions of the PYK1 and PDH into
account, the TCA reactions reveal a more dense interaction cluster. The PDH interacts with KGD sharing the
common subunit lipoamide dehydrogenase (LPD1). The
PYK1 interacts with PDH, KGD as well as IDH (Figure
5C).

The remaining reported direct physical interactions contained in the fPIN between enzymes detected within metabolic pathways are distributed throughout anabolic
pathways. Most interactions are found in the biosynthesis
of ergosterol, ubiquinone, sphingolipid and glucogen
synthesis (Additional File 3). Single links between
enzymes can be found in biosynthetic pathways of pyrimidine, leucine, isoleucine, and lysine. Within the fatty
acid synthesis pathway, the malic enzyme (MAE1) interacts with the alpha subunit of FAS and Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1) (Additional File 3)
Figures 5B, C and the Additional File 3 provide a comprehensive account of all reported protein interactions
mapped to canonical metabolic pathways from the SGD
database; i.e. for pathways not included in this figure, no
protein interaction was contained in the PIN.
Central proteins in the fPIN
Analyzing centrality as judged by the z-score of the change
of the characteristic length of the graph after removal of a
particular node identified enzymes with the most influence on the cohesion of the interactome. The ten most
influencing proteins are listed in Table 4. ATP14 exhibits
the most influence on the characteristic length of the fPIN.
The H-chain of the ATP synthase is one of 17 polypeptides
building up the complex (Figure 6A). While only interacting with a relatively low number of other subunits of its
own complex, it interacts with the Complex IV (Cytochrome c) of the respiratory chain, via COX5B and Complex III (Cytochrome b-c1) via QCR8. Furthermore, it
interacts with the FBA1 from the glycolysis pathway, a
central enzyme assembling the glycolytic cluster.

COX1 and COX5B are two of 11 subunits of Cytochrom
b-c1 (Figure 6B). While COX1 plays an essential role in
the assembly of the complex, the role of COX5b is the
interaction with ATP synthase. The FBA1 and GPM1 are
part of the glycolytic cluster. Taken together, the glycolysis
pathway and the respiratory chain are tightly connected
via physical interactions illustrated in Figure 7A.

Ten most central proteins in the fPIN as judged by the z-score of the change of the characteristic length of the graph after removal of a particular
protein, robustness centrality (RB). For comparison to other centrality measures, the z-scores and respective rank (in parentheses) of the
betweenness centrality (BN) as well as degree centrality (DC) were evaluated. The overall correlation between the centrality was RB~BN 0.70 (pValue: 4.35E-220), RB~DC 0.59 (p-Value: 1.44E-144) and BN~DC 0.25 (p-Value 3.37E-23)

TSC13 and IFA38, which are responsible for the elongation of very long fatty acids, connect enzymes involved in
the biosynthesis of membrane lipids by interacting with
enzymes from the biosynthesis of fatty acids, steroids and
related metabolites, phosphatidyl -choline, -serine and ethanol amine, suggesting that the pathways are brought
into spatial proximity via protein-protein interactions
(Figure 7B).
For comparison, other centrality measures for the top 10
most influencing proteins are listed in Table 4. While an
overall correlation between the centrality measures is evident (correlation coefficients and associated p-values are
provided in the legend of Table 4), each centrality meas-

ure identifies particular aspects of centrality and does not
correspond directly to the robustness measure used here.

Discussion
Our investigations integrated protein interaction networks with metabolic networks to study the extent to
which metabolic pathways; i.e. functional processes, are
pre-formed in the underlying structural interaction network, i.e. the "plumbing" of cellular components. The
networks examined here were derived from different
sources of information and provide different views on the
metabolic as well as protein interaction systems.

We discovered that sub-systems of the entire protein-protein interaction network may follow specific organizing
principles. While interactions associated with signaling
and other regulatory processes (e.g. transcriptional regulation via DNA-interaction associated proteins) were found
to be dissortative; i.e. proteins of high degree interact with
proteins of low degree, interactions between metabolic
enzymes were observed to be assortative such that
enzymes frequently interact with other enzymes of similar
degree (Table 1). Regulatory processes may often involve
hierarchical one-to-many associations such as master regulators (e.g. kinases) and their respective individual target
proteins. Physical interactions between metabolic
enzymes, on the other hand, appear to generally follow a
more horizontal organization with enzymes participating
in larger complexes or sequential one-to-one interaction
chains. Nonetheless, we identified interaction hub
enzymes that are located at central positions integrating
several metabolic systems and whose removal would
severely impact the structural integrity of larger portions
of the metabolism-focused metabolic network (fPIN,
Table 4, Figure 7A, B).

When dealing with characteristics of protein-protein interaction network, possible technological as well as biases
introduced by targeted scientific interest always are a concern. To best avoid this problem, it would be ideal to use
strictly unbiased datasets for analysis. However, such fully
unbiased datasets are not available (yet) as this would
require nothing less than an identification of all true and
relevant protein-protein interactions occurring inside
cells. Presently, we have to resort to the best available
unbiased datasets generated by high-throughput screens.
As the BIOGRID data contains information about the
source of information, it is possible to evaluate the assortativity of the biggest subsets in the database that were
obtained from high-throughput experiment, namely Krogan et. al [48] comprising 1,669 nodes involved in 2,682
interactions, and Gavin et al. [49] with 2682 nodes
involved in 8,138 interactions. Reducing the filtered PIN
to the these subsets yields two sub-fPINs comprising 364
nodes involved in 411 interactions, and 757 nodes
involved in 475 interactions, respectively. The reduced
fPINs exhibit an assortativity of 0.31 and 0.15, respectively, confirming the results obtained for the whole fPIN.
Correspondingly, for the rPIN, a reduced assortativity was
obtained for both datasets with 0.15 for the Gavin set

Page 13 of 20

BMC Systems Biology 2008, 2:100

(Nnodes = 1,669, Ninteractions = 10,992) and -0.01 (Nnodes =
2,682 and Ninteractions = 8,138) for the Krogan set. Thus,
given the available datasets, the increased positive assortativity of filtered/enzyme PINs does not appear to be resulting from a bias towards well-studied enzymes.
We generated three different versions of the metabolic
interaction network (MIN). The enzyme interaction network, EIN, was introduced to capture all possible metabolic interactions between enzymes, whereas the mapEIN
transformed the pathway knowledge available in KEGG
into a metabolic network. The compound interaction network, CIN, was created as an alternative and focuses on
main metabolites as network nodes rather than enzymes.
With regard to our main research focus, the topological
equivalence of protein interactions and metabolic pathways, all three versions yielded significant positive correlations between the respective shortest paths across both
network types (Table 2). Thus, the reported results proved
robust against details of the network reconstruction
approach. All three MIN-versions were reported here with
positive assortativity (Table 1) while a negative assortativity of metabolic networks has been reported elsewhere
(degree correlation coefficient of -0.24 [50]). We note that
this difference is caused by the elimination of ubiquitous
(currency) metabolites and the inclusion of only main
metabolic substrates and products in this work. Including
all metabolites in the CIN yielded a degree correlation
coefficient, rd, of -0.3 and an increased mean cluster coefficient of 0.7. As currency metabolites such as ATP follow
a one-to-many network motif, thereby also introducing
many more edges in the network, the dissortativity
obtained when including them as well as the increased
mean cluster coefficient can be rationalized.
The decision on the exact procedure to generate metabolic
networks must remain operational and may dependent
on the objective of the study at hand. Defining metabolic
networks based on carbon atomic traces in metabolic
reactions resulted in different topological characteristics
of metabolic networks than for the commonly used
approaches [45].
The interaction networks investigated in this study vary
regarding their graph-parameters, such as characteristic
length (CL) values and scale-free exponents and also differ
from some networks reconstructed. Generally, biological
networks tend to be scale-free with associated scale-free
exponents reported below two, which was suggested to
result form evolutionary mechanism driven by gene
duplication [51]. However, larger exponents have been
reported for the CIN [29]. Joang et al. analyzed compound interaction networks of 43 organisms. The average
CL was observed as 3.29 ± 0.11 and the average scale-free
exponent as 2.18 ± 0.09. While the scale-free exponent

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/2/100

reported here (2.4) is in line with the reported average
value, the CL reported here is much larger (12.3). The reasons for the difference can be attributed mainly to the different approaches taken to reconstruct the CIN, and the
filtering mechanisms applied to remove compounds that
are not directly relevant for main biochemical pathway
routes such as co-factors. Here, we followed the concept of
main metabolite relations introduced by Kotera and coworkers and annotated accordingly in the KEGG database
[52,53]. By contrast, the networks of Joang et al. comprised all relations between all substrates and products,
including currency metabolites such as H2O or ATP rendering the CL much smaller.
In their analysis of the E. coli metabolic pathway network,
Wagner and Fell reported a mean CL of 3.8. This value
compares favorably with our value (3.64) for the yeast
EIN, which corresponds to the network analyzed by Wagner and Fell [30]. A similar value has also been reported
by Huthmacher et al. (CL = 3) [25]. Similarly, the scalefree exponents agree well (-1.3 Wagner and Fell; -1.2
reported here for yeast). Kotera et al. [53] reported a CL of
9 for the equivalent of our CIN. The larger value we
obtained (CL = 12.3) is explained by the exclusion of currency metabolites in our analysis. The newly introduced
mapEIN (CL = 6.62) is not directly comparable to previous studies. It was constructed to capture our accumulated
knowledge of biochemical pathways represented in KEGG
and with nodes represented by enzymes, not compounds.
For the rPIN, our reported values for graph properties such
as CL and scale-free exponent agree well with previously
reported data [31,54]. For the other PIN types studied by
us, no comparative data are available.
In their analysis of protein interaction data in the context
of metabolic pathways, Huthmacher and co-workers [25]
focused on direct interactions between enzymes catalyzing consecutive metabolic reaction steps. Here, we
expanded the scope of an integrative analysis by also
showing that such correlation between metabolic and
protein interaction data is discernable even at larger distances. Of course, an increased probability for consecutive
enzymes to interact naturally leads to correlations at larger
distances as well, even though the significance can be
expected to drop. We showed that such large-scale topological correspondence between both the PIN and MIN
indeed exists adding further evidence for the significance
of physical interactions for the functioning of metabolic
reactions. Our analysis also revealed that shortest paths
between two enzymes appear to be shorter in the PIN
compared to their distance when analyzed in the metabolic network (Figure 3, elevated z-scores above the diagonal), especially when the allowed physical interactions
also include proteins not actively participating in enzy-

BMC Systems Biology 2008, 2:100

matic reactions (fPIN). A direct comparison of shortest
paths between enzyme pairs connected via valid paths in
both the fPIN and the ePIN yielded a mean distances of
5.3 for the fPIN, where non-metabolically active proteins
are still included, compared to 6.2 for the ePIN. Thus, our
analyses suggest that such metabolically passive proteins
may function as interface components to spatially organize enzymatic pathways.
The functional significance of topological parameters of
molecular networks has largely been analyzed within the
context of the examined network type itself such as the
reported relationship between fluxes passing through
metabolic network edges (reactions) and the degree product of the connected nodes [40], but not across different
network types. Here, we showed that such relationships
can also be established across different network types such
that topological parameters of enzymes within the context
of protein interactions have relevance for their functional,
metabolic context. In particular, we observed that metabolic flux rates are positively correlated with degree and
centrality of enzymes in their PIN (Table 3). We interpret
this observation as evidence for a co-evolutionary adaptation of both network types. High-flux enzymes are physically interacting with many other enzymes such that
metabolic substrates and products can be passed on to
subsequent enzymes quickly and efficiently.
On the technical side, it has to be borne in mind that our
knowledge of protein interactions is certainly incomplete
and may contain many false positive interactions [55,56]
and the employed technologies may skew the datasets
towards particular interactions [57]. Furthermore, since
we used sub-cellular localization information to eliminate potential false positive protein associations, this
information, too, is to some degree based on predictions
alone and may contain erroneous assignments. However,
the fact that we did observe significant correlations
between protein interactions and metabolic pathways
despite the noise in the data may suggest that the true topological correspondence may actually be even stronger
than reported here.

Methods
Because yeast represents a model organism with comprehensive experimental as well as annotation data available
for both protein-protein interactions as well as metabolic
reaction pathways, we focus our investigations on Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Protein Interaction Networks (PIN)
To study protein interaction networks (PINs) from a global perspective as well as by focusing on enzymatic proteins alone, we generated three different network graphs
describing protein-protein interactions. The raw, unfiltered PIN (rPIN) was constructed by extracting physical
interactions reported in the protein interaction databases
DIP, version 20060402 [58] and BIOGrid, version 2.0.21
[59], respectively. Based on available gene ontology (GO)
annotation information, proteins involved in processes
related to protein translation, DNA-transcription and
associated regulatory processes, such as transcription or
translation factors, as well as proteins involved in the
assembly of chromatin structures were labeled as 'DNArelated'. Proteins involved in degradation and related regulatory proteins were labeled as 'degradation-related',
protein kinases and phosphatases and related regulators
labeled as 'kinase-phophatase-related'. Additionally, we
defined a set of proteins as 'other non-metabolic proteins'.
This set comprised proteins assigned to unspecific functions and processes as judged by their available Gene
Ontology (GO) annotation such as binding to unfolded
proteins, protein targeting, protein transport, protein tagging as well as other post transcriptional modifications
other than phosphorylation, which were labeled as
kinase-phophatase-related. Proteins assigned to any of the
above sets and associated physical interactions were
removed from the rPIN to generate a second PIN, the filtered protein-protein interaction graph (fPIN). Thus, in
the fPIN, all protein interactions of proteins involved
functions other than metabolism – as judged by their GOannotation – were removed from the rPIN. It also
included proteins with currently unknown function. A
third PIN including only enzymes as judged by an
assigned EC-number was also generated and designated as
the ePIN.

Conclusion
Our results reveal topological equivalences between the
protein interaction network and the metabolic pathway
network. Evolved protein interactions may contribute significantly towards rendering metabolic processes more
efficient by permitting increased metabolic fluxes. Thus,
our results shed further light on the unifying principles
shaping the evolution of both the functional (metabolic)
as well as the physical interaction network.

Interactions with inconsistent localization annotation
according to the available gene ontology, GO:CellularComponent annotation information; i.e. interactions
between proteins located in different sub-cellular compartments, were discarded from the fPIN and ePIN as well.
In case of membrane-embedded proteins, interactions
between proteins localized in different, but neighboring
compartments were retained.

GO-Annotations for yeast genes were obtained from the
SGD database [60]. The evidence codes for the gene ontology were not considered.
The GO-annotation information used to sub-set the protein data is available in the Additional File 4.
Metabolic Interaction Networks (MINs)
Metabolic Interaction Networks (MINs) are represented in
this study by Enzyme Interaction Networks (EINs) focusing on metabolic reactions as well as a Compound Interaction Networks (CIN) establishing links between
metabolites directly.

The metabolic reaction lists form KEGG [61], YeastCyc
[62], and the set of metabolic reactions obtained from a
whole-genome metabolic reconstruction approach, in the
following referred to as the Förster-Set [46], were merged
and used to reconstruct the Enzyme Interaction Network
(EIN). The corresponding network graph is a representation of EC-numbers and associated reactions and their
metabolic interactions. Two nodes are considered connected if they share at least one common substrate or
product. Ubiquitously occurring molecules, so-called currency metabolites, such as H+, NH3, H2O, CO2, and metal
ions as well as coenzymes and co-substrates such as CoA,
NADH+, FAD, SAM have been excluded from the analysis.
In total, 51 metabolites were excluded. (see Additional
File 4).
The applied connectivity conditions to generate the EIN
may produce links that are theoretically possible, but that
have not been experimentally verified yet. To reflect the
available biological knowledge, we also generated a metabolic network from curated pathway maps, the mapEIN.
For the reconstruction of the mapEIN, the relations
between enzymes were extracted directly from the xmldescription files of the pathway maps from the KEGG
database. Two nodes in this graph are connected if both
are associated with at least one common metabolite node
in a map.
The EINs reflect relationships between enzymes or reactions, respectively. Alternatively, a metabolic network can
be reconstructed considering metabolites themselves as
nodes. Such a network, the compound (metabolite) interaction network (CIN), was constructed utilizing the reaction lists from KEGG. Two metabolites are considered
connected if both are recognized as a main substrateproduct reaction as annotated in KEGG, respectively. As
for EINs, currency metabolites and co-enzymes and cosubstrates have been discarded from consideration. The
YeastCyc and Förster-Set was not considered for the construction of the CIN as both databases do not differentiate

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1752-0509/2/100

between main and side substrates or products, respectively.
Topological properties of networks
To characterize global as well as local properties of the
molecular interaction networks analyzed in this study, we
computed several well established graph-theoretic network parameters.

The characteristic length (CL) describes the average shortest path of a graph, i.e. the expected shortest distance
between any two different nodes. The CL was calculated
applying Equation 1:
CL =

1
E

∑ d(i, j)

E = {(i, j) ∈ {1, 2,..., N } x {1, 2,..., N } : ∞ > d(i, j) ≥ 0 ∧ j > i}

(i , j)∈E

(1)
where d(i, j) is the distance (shortest path) between nodes
i and j, N is the total number of nodes, E defines the set of
considered node pairs and |E| is their total number. Distances between unconnected node pairs were not considered.
The connectivity distribution, P(k), was calculated according to Equation 2,

P( k) =

Nk
N

(2)

where k is the degree of nodes, i.e. the number of links
associated with a node, N is the total number of nodes,
and Nk is the number of nodes of degree k. The directionality of links was not considered. Biological networks were
shown to follow scale-freeness according to a power law
degree distribution with P(k) ≈ k-γ, where γ is the scale-free
exponent [26-30], which was estimated by the slope of the
linear regression line of degree distributions in log-log
diagrams.
The cluster coefficient (c) is a measure of modularity of a
graph. It measures to which degree the neighborhood of a
node resembles a complete; i.e. fully connected graph.
The cluster coefficient and its mean value were calculated
according to Eqs. 3 [63].

∑
r ,p∈N k >1

where A denotes the adjacency matrix with elements set to
1 in case of an established link between nodes and zero
otherwise; ki is the degree of node i for which c is computed, i, p, and r are indexes of all nodes in the network

The neighbors' connectivity NC(k) measures the affinity
of a nodes of a particular degree to interact with nodes of
either higher, similar, or lower degree. The neighbors'
connectivity, NC, of a particular node is the average degree
of its neighboring nodes [64]. NC(k) is the average NC for
nodes of degree k. It is an increasing function of k when a
graph is assortative, i.e. high-degree nodes preferentially
tend to interact with degrees of similar, high degree. The
function is decreasing when high-degree nodes preferentially interact with nodes of lower degree; then the graph
is said to be dissortative. Assortativity is defined as the
Pearson correlation of the degrees of neighbors, rd. If the
distribution is uniform, rd equals zero, otherwise rd is positive for assortative graphs or negative for dissortative
graphs. The assortativity was measured according to an
algorithm proposed by Newman [65] (Eq. 4).

sented multiple times in the EINs. Likewise, unique ECnumbers may be assigned to multiple proteins. The ECnumbers may comprise multiple metabolites as well. All
such possible relations between the PIN and MINs were
considered.
We evaluated enrichments and depletions of particular
distance fields in the abundance matrix by comparing the
actual counts to counts obtained from 1,000 randomly
produced PIN-MIN correlations. For the randomization,
protein-names within the PIN were shuffled among the
graph's nodes. In this procedure, the nodes of the PINs
were randomly assigned to a protein name leading to
alteration of protein – EC-number relations while preserving the topology of the graphs. Statistical enrichment and
depletion of actual counts versus random expectation
were judged by the z-score (Equations 5) of a particular
element of the abundance matrix.

where rd, is the assortativity, j and k are the degrees of
nodes at the ends of the ith edge within the set of considered node pairs E and |E| is their total number, as notated
for Eq. 1.
Correlation of metabolic and protein interaction networks
The PINs were related to the EIN and mapEIN via proteinEC-number relations; i.e. proteins (enzymes) were identified in both network types and, subsequently, their pairwise distance computed in both network types. ECnumber annotations were taken from KEGG [61], YeastCyc [62], SGD [60] and Expasy [66]. The relation of PINs
to the CIN followed from indirect protein – EC-numbermetabolite mappings according to the annotation information in KEGG. Nodes were considered equivalent in
both network types, if for a metabolite (node in the CIN)
the corresponding protein (nodes in the PIN) was identified via its EC-number annotation and its list of main
metabolites associated with the reaction catalyzed by the
enzyme.

For nodes with representation in both networks, the
respective shortest distances were correlated. The distribution of distances within the PINs and MINs were evaluated by consideration of all such node couples resulting in
abundance matrices. The two dimensions of the abundance matrix are the respective distances in the PINs and
MINs, and the elements contain the observed counts for
the respective distances pairs. Note that proteins may be
assigned to more than one EC-number and can be repre-

where n is the number of times a particular distance pair
dPIN and dMIN was observed (nobserved) or obtained in random networks (nrand), brackets indicate mean values, and
dPIN > 0 and dMIN > 0 (see next paragraph).
Treatment of multi-enzyme complexes
If subunits belonging to the same multi-enzyme complex
carried identical EC numbers, their distance was considered zero and their network relationship was not analyzed
further in the correlation analysis as the minimum distance included in the analyses is one. If they carried different EC numbers, their distances were computed as for any
other enzyme pair given the available data.
The centrality of nodes
The centrality of nodes in PINs was measured either by
their betweenness (BN) according to the algorithms proposed by Newman [67], or by the influence on the average
shortest path between enzymes (CLEC), according to the
Equations 5. While BN corresponds to the number of
shortest paths leading through a particular node, the latter
centrality measure evaluates the changes on the average
shortest path length of a graph after removal of a particular node. For each node, a z-score of CLEC was calculated
to judge the centrality of a node (Eqs. 6).

Correlation of PINs and metabolic flux rates
For correlating PINs and metabolic flux rates, we used flux
rate data from a large-scale 13C-flux analysis from Blank
and colleagues [47]. In this approach, flux rates of
enzymes of the global metabolic network of yeast strain
iFF708 [46] were estimated by flux balance analysis. In
particular, we used data of flux rates measured in yeast
growing in a glucose-containing medium resulting in flux
data for 747 unique reactions catalyzed by 672 enzymes.
The enzymes were divided into a group of enzymes with
flux rates greater than 50, enzymes with flux rates between
10 and 50, flux rates of 0.1 to 1, 1.0E-4 and 0.1, and 0 to
1.0E-4 relative to an uptake of glucose set to 100 (arbitrary
flux units). While the flux rates were divided according to
a logarithmic scale, the range 1.0E-4 to 0.1 had been chosen to yield similar numbers of enzymes in all bins.
Metabolic pathways
Metabolic pathways and associated proteins used in this
study were taken from the SGD database. For the fatty acid
synthesis pathway, malic enzyme was assumed as a source
of NADPH and the malat dehydrogenase as a source of
AcetylCoA and added to the pathway.

Enrichment and depletion of the abundance of shortest path pairs between
nodes represented in both the PIN and MIN. The enrichments and depletions were judged by the z-score (number in cell) of the frequency of observations (number in paranthesis) in comparison to randomized
distribution with red-color indicating enrichment and blue-color depletion
relative to randomized networks. Distances > 14 comprise distances
greater than 14 and not connected distance pairs. Blank cells indicates 0
path pairs with z-Score of 0.

Dependency of PIN-MIN shortest path correlations as a function of

and EIN; D) rPIN and mapEIN; E) fPIN and mapEIN; F) ePIN and
mapEIN; G) rPIN and CIN; H) fPIN and CIN and I) ePIN and EIN I).
Generally, a trend towards more pronounced correlations with decreasing
cutoff distance is evident. Note: The drop in correlation values for short
distance cutoff values is primarily explained by the inevitable loss of correlation when the considered absolute range is reduced. This is purely a
statistical effect. For any correlated, but scattered data, correlation coefficients inevitably drop, if the considered range is reduced.
