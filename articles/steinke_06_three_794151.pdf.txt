Abstract
Background: Evolution of the deuterostome lineage was accompanied by an increase in
systematic complexity especially with regard to highly specialized tissues and organs. Based on the
observation of an increased number of paralogous genes in vertebrates compared with
invertebrates, two entire genome duplications (2R) were proposed during the early evolution of
vertebrates. Most glycolytic enzymes occur as several copies in vertebrate genomes, which are
specifically expressed in certain tissues. Therefore, the glycolytic pathway is particularly suitable for
testing theories of the involvement of gene/genome duplications in enzyme evolution.
Results: We assembled datasets from genomic databases of at least nine vertebrate species and
at least three outgroups (one deuterostome and two protostomes), and used maximum likelihood
and Bayesian methods to construct phylogenies of the 10 enzymes of the glycolytic pathway.
Through this approach, we intended to gain insights into the vertebrate specific evolution of
enzymes of the glycolytic pathway. Many of the obtained gene trees generally reflect the history of
two rounds of duplication during vertebrate evolution, and were in agreement with the hypothesis
of an additional duplication event within the lineage of teleost fish. The retention of paralogs
differed greatly between genes, and no direct link to the multimeric structure of the active enzyme
was found.
Conclusion: The glycolytic pathway has subsequently evolved by gene duplication and divergence
of each constituent enzyme with taxon-specific individual gene losses or lineage-specific
duplications. The tissue-specific expression might have led to an increased retention for some
genes since paralogs can subdivide the ancestral expression domain or find new functions, which
are not necessarily related to the original function.

Background
In many cases, evolution is accompanied by an increase of
genetic and phenotypic complexity, yet the biochemical
machinery necessary for the energy supply of an increas-

ing diversity of cell- and tissue types had to work effectively, even if different tissues have specific conditions
such as pH values, ion and substrate concentrations.
Based on basic data such as genome sizes and allozymes,

Ohno [1] proposed that the increase in complexity-during
the evolution of the vertebrate lineage was accompanied
by an increase in gene number due to duplication of genes
and/or genomes. Recent data from genome sequencing
projects showed that genome size is not strongly correlated with the numbers of genes an organism possesses.
Nevertheless, for many genes, multiple copies can be
found in vertebrates, while basal deuterostomes and
invertebrates typically have only one orthologous copy.
The "one-two-four" rule is the current model to explain
the evolution of gene families and of vertebrate genomes
more generally (Figure 1). Based on this model, two
rounds of genome duplication occurred early in the vertebrate evolution [2,3], but see also [4,5]. An ancestral
genome was duplicated to two copies after the first
genome duplication (1R), and then to four copies after
the second (2R) duplication [6,7]. While it is commonly
accepted that 1/2R occurred before the divergence of
Chondrichthyes [8], the position of lamprey and hagfish
relative to the 1R still remains unclear, even though there
is some evidence for a 1R-early (before divergence of
cyclostomes) [9]. Recent data suggest that an additional
whole genome duplication occurred in the fish lineage
(3R or fish-specific genome duplication, extending the
"one-two-four" to a "one-two-four-eight" rule [10-16].
Duplicated genes, resulting from large scale duplications,
initially possess the same regulatory elements and identi-

cal amino-acid sequence and are therefore thought to be
redundant in their function, which means that inactivation of one of the two duplicates should have little or no
effect on the phenotype, provided that there are no dosage
compensation effects [17]. Therefore, since one of the
copies is free from functional constraint, mutations in this
gene might be selectively neutral and will eventually turn
the gene into a non-functional pseudogene. Although
gene loss is a frequent event, 20–50% of paralogous genes
are retained for longer evolutionary time spans after a
genome duplication event [18,19]. On the other hand, a
series of non-deleterious mutations might change the
function of the duplicate gene copy [20]. Natural selection
can prevent the loss of redundant genes [21] if those genes
code for components of multidomain proteins, because
mutant alleles disrupt such proteins. A selective advantage
due to a novel function might be sufficient to retain this
gene copy and to select against replacement substitutions
and prevent this functional gene copy from turning into a
pseudogene. In this way, genes can pick up new functions
(neofunctionalization) [6] or divide the ancestral function between the paralogs (subfunctionalization) [22].
The glycolytic pathway is particularly suitable for testing
theories of enzyme evolution and the involvement of
gene/genome duplications. Previous phylogenetic analyses of these enzymes mainly focused on deep phylogenies
[23,24] or the evolution of alternative pathways in differ-

ent organisms, which displays high variability in bacteria
[25,26]. This central metabolic pathway is highly conserved and ancient; it is therefore possible to compare
enzymes from phylogenetically distant organisms [27].
The standard pathway includes 10 reaction steps; glucose
is processed to pyruvate with the net yield of two molecules of adenosine triphosphate and two reduced molecules of hydrogenated nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
per molecule of glucose broken down. The classical glycolytic reactions are catalyzed by the following 10 enzymes:
hexokinase (HK; EC 2.7.1.1), phosphoglucose isomerase
(PGI; EC 5.3.1.9), phosphofructokinase (PFK; EC
2.7.1.11), fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA; EC
4.1.2.13); triosephosphate isomerase (TPI; EC 5.3.1.1),
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; EC
1.2.1.12), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK; EC 2.7.2.3),
phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM; EC 5.4.2.1), enolase
(ENO; EC 4.2.1.11), and pyruvate kinase (PK; EC
2.7.1.40) [28].
The tertiary structures of all 10 of these enzymes show a
superficial similarity; they are all variations on a common
theme [27]. All glycolytic enzymes belong to the class of
α/β-barrel proteins. Since this pathway is of crucial importance for the energy delivery of any cell, these genes are
thought to be highly conserved and therefore have often
been used as phylogenetic markers for "deep" phylogenies
[23,29,30]. In fact, glycolytic enzymes are probably
among the most conserved proteins known. Many vertebrate genes occur in multiple copies in the genome, and
are often expressed in a tissue-specific manner. This
increased genetic complexity might be utilized for highly
specific requirements in terms of substrate optimum, pH
value and salt concentration in different types of tissues
[31]. Glucokinase, one of the hexokinase isozymes, is
expressed in the liver and the pancreas, and requires a
high concentration of glucose to reach the maximum
turnover rate. As a result of this, high glucose levels after
food uptake are reduced by the production of glycogen in
the liver [32]. The other hexokinase isozymes work with
much lower substrate concentrations.
The main goal of the present work was to contribute to an
evolutionary understanding of glycolysis by phylogenetic
analyses of the 10 glycolytic enzymes from representatives
of the vertebrate lineage. Based on the observation of
increased size of gene families in vertebrates [10,33-40]
and their highly specialized tissues, we expected to find
duplications of entire pathways in the vertebrate lineage.

Results
For most glycolytic enzymes, two or more copies can be
found in vertebrates. The topologies for the inferred gene
trees generally reflect the history of one or two rounds of
duplications within the vertebrate lineage plus an addi-

tional duplication event within the teleost fish. The phylogenetic analyses confirm duplication events leading to
multiple copies within vertebrates; these duplications
occurred almost invariantly after the divergence of the
urochordate C. intestinalis (Figures 2B, 2C, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5A,
5C)
Tetrameric enzymes
Glycolytic enzymes, which are active as tetramers, occur as
1–4 copies in vertebrate genomes, likely as a result of
ancient genome duplication events (1R and 2R). They display clearly different evolutionary patterns (Figure 2).

The tree for PFK reflects a perfect 1R/2R topology with
three additional 3R events in the liver-specific isoform
PFK1, the muscle-specific PFK2, and the platelet isoform
PFK4 (Figure 2A). The first duplication led to PFK1/4 and
PFK2/3 gene pairs (1R). The second duplication event segregates these precursors into the extant genes (2R). Except
for PFK3, all PFK isoforms occur in more than one copy in
ray-finned fishes (3R). However, for Danio rerio, searches
of genomic and expressed sequence tag (EST) data yielded
no second PFK1, PFK2 and PFK4 paralog as in the pufferfishes, where there is strong support for 3R. Since the
Danio rerio genome is currently in a rather fragmented and
incomplete state, the chances of missing data are quite
high. On the other hand, the possibility of gene loss in
certain lineages also cannot be neglected. Reciprocal loss
of genes has been proposed as a mechanism for speciation
[41].
The duplication of GAPDH seems to have occurred before
the evolution of the bilaterian animals (Figure 2B). The
liver-specific GAPDH (in vertebrates [42]) is found in all
bilaterian species included in this analysis, whereas the
testis-specific form occurs only in vertebrates. The tree
topology of the liver-specific form reflects the general bilaterian phylogeny only in parts, most likely due to the
sparse taxon sampling. Notably, the monophyly of protostomes and in particular the ecdysozoans is not recovered,
since the two distinct copies of Caenorhabditis were placed
as a sister group to the deuterostomes, albeit without significant support. For Xenopus, BLAST searches of genomic
and EST data yielded no GAPDH copy.
The phylogeny of PK shows only one duplication event
within the vertebrate lineage with an additional clearly
resolved fish-specific duplication event, which occurred in
the blood-specific [43] form PK1 (Figure 2C).
Heterodimeric enzymes
The topologies for the obtained gene trees of ENO and
PGM reflect the history of 1R/2R/3R (Figure 3). We
obtained full-length ENO cDNA sequences for two genes
each from bichir (Polypterus senegalus) and sturgeon (Aci-

penser baerii), both basal ray-finned fish, and caecilian
(Typhlonectes natans). Database searches revealed three
copies of ENO within the vertebrates (Figure 3A). The
sequences of lampreys and hagfish cluster with the ENO γ
paralogous group, implying that the first duplication (1R)
took place before the split of cyclostomes from the gnathostome lineage, as it has also been indicated by a study on
Hox genes [9]. The positions of another lamprey sequence
is basal to the multiple copies, possibly a long-branch
attraction artifact, pulling this fast-evolving sequence
towards the outgroup. The liver-specific ENO α is duplicated in actinopterygians, with a proposed timing of the
duplication before the divergence of Polypterus and Acipenser. The bootstrap support for this topology, which
contradicts the current view of the fish-specific duplication being limited to teleosts, [44-46] is low. For Acipenserformes, however, polyploidy is a known phenomenon
[47]. One fish-specific paralog displays an increased rate,
especially in Takifugu rubripes. The differences in aminoacid sequence are distributed over the complete sequence
and cannot be linked to a specific functional domain. The
same is true for all three teleost ENO γ sequences used in
this study.
The topology for PGAM reflects the well-supported history 2R/3R in the brain isoform PGAM1 and an additional

gene duplication within the human lineage (Figure 3B).
The first duplication led to erythrocyte-specific bisphophoglycerate mutase (BGAM) and the precursor of PGM1
and PGM2; the latter is assumed to be a muscle-specific
isoform [48].
Homodimeric enzymes
Within PGI and TPI, the major phylogenetic relationships
are in agreement with the widely accepted phylogeny of
vertebrates (Figure 4). Based on the phylogenetic analyses,
duplication events leading to multiple copies within vertebrates could not be shown. However, there were duplication events during the evolution of ray-finned fish, so
there are two copies each in zebrafish, puffer fishes,
medaka, striped mullet and trout for PGI (Figure 4A), and
two copies in zebrafish, platyfish and one pufferfish
(Tetraodon nigroviridis) for TPI (Figure 4B), respectively.
No second TPI paralog in Takifugu rubripes could be found
within genomic and EST databases, which might indicate
an event of gene loss.

tion could be detected. The topology for HK shows three
rounds of duplication within the vertebrate lineage, which
is not in agreement with our expectations. An additional
duplication event happened within the lineage of rayfinned fish in the brain isoform, HK1 (Figure 5A). The first
duplication led to HK4 (glucokinase), a 50-kDa enzyme,
and the protoortholog of HK1, 2, 3 (all 100 kDa). The second duplication produced HK3, which shows a somewhat
higher rate of evolution than the other isoforms, and a
HK1/2 precursor, which gave rise to HK1 and HK2 in a
subsequent gene duplication that most likely occurred in
a gnathostome ancestor (2R). Zebrafish paralogs for HK1
and HK 3 could not be found in the last version of the
Ensembl database (WTSIZv5). Thus, the timing of duplication events within the ray-finned fish in HK1 cannot be
determined, and the duplication might be limited to pufferfish species.
The analyses revealed a mammal specific duplication
event for PGK (Figure 5B). They possess a testis-specific
isoform (PGK2) and a liver-specific isoform (PGK1). The

position of the wallaby sequence implies that the duplication occurred before the divergence of placental mammals
and marsupials.
Based on the phylogenetic analyses, the FBA duplication
events leading to the multiple copies within vertebrates
occurred clearly after the divergence of the lampreys (Figure 5C), which suggests a timing of the 1R/2R after the
cyclostome split (but see the ENO tree, Figure 3B). The
brain-specific isoform FBA C and the muscle-specific isoform FBA A show additional duplication events within the
ray-finned fish lineage. For FBA C within the teleosts, a
duplication preceding the split of Polypterus and Acipenser
is proposed; this is not in agreement with the current
hypothesis of the timing of the FSGD [44-46]. The unexpected topology is probably caused by a reconstruction
artifact due to the very fast-evolving sequences of one of
the fish-specific copies. A study based on yeast paralogs
has shown that an increased evolutionary rate of one copy
can lead to errors in phylogenetic reconstruction [49]. The
differences in the sequences are distributed over the com-

[50]. We also obtained FBA sequences for Acipenser baerii
and Polypterus senegalus that clustered in the paralog A
group, which is considered to be the muscle-specific isoform. One additional copy of FBA A in Danio rerio placed
basal to the zebrafish/pufferfish split rejects the possibility
of a zebrafish-specific duplication event. The Typhlonectes
natans (caecilian) sequence (FBA A) forms a monophyletic group with the sequences from the Xenopus species, as expected. The FBA B isoform places the basal rayfinned fish (Acipenser baerii, Polypterus ornatipinnis) basal
to a cluster containing tetrapods and derived ray-finned
fish (Danio rerio, Tetraodon nigroviridis). This might be due
to the partial character of these sequences, which were
used from a previous study [29].

ent tissues and different organisms. Genome duplications
appear to have been the principal mechanism that gives
rise to multiple copies of isoenzymes. The topologies for
eight of the gene trees (Figures 2, 3, 4, 5) generally reflect
the 1R/2R/3R genome duplication history during vertebrate evolution. Convincing data supporting the 2R
hypothesis stems from paralogons, genomic regions containing paralogous genes and therefore being the result of
large-scale duplications [52-54]. Only some of the glycolytic enzymes showing 1R/2R duplications are found on
chromosomes where paralogons have been previously
reported, i.e., PK (PK3 on chromosome 15, PK1 on chromosome 1), ENO (ENOα on chromosome 1, ENOβ on
chromosome 17, ENOγ on chromosome 12), HK (HK1
on chromosome 10, HK2 on chromosome 2, HK3 on
chromosome5), and FBA (FBAA on chromosome 16,
FBAC on chromosome 17).

Discussion

For many single-copy genes in tetrapods, two copies have
been described for ray-finned fish. The first observation of
this pattern began with the discovery of more than four
Hox clusters in zebrafish (Danio rerio) [55] and medaka

The individual glycolytic enzymes are among the most
slowly evolving genes [51], yet the glycolytic pathway has
adapted to the varying metabolic requirements of differ-

(Oryzias latipes) [56]. Recent data from puffer-fish
genomes confirmed the existence of at least seven Hox
clusters even in these very compact genomes [57,58].
With an increase of available sequences, especially from
genome and EST projects, the number of genes which
show a duplication event in the fish lineage increased significantly [10-12,15,34,38,59-61]. Data from the genes
analyzed in this study, including genomic sequences
(Tetraodon nigroviridis, Takifugu rubripes) and EST data
(Danio rerio), shows that enzyme isoforms were duplicated before the divergence of Ostariophysii (zebrafish)
and Neoteleostei (medaka, pufferfishes). The determination of the phylogenetic timing of the duplication event
for glycolytic genes is difficult due to missing sequence
data for basal actinopterygian species (bichir, sturgeon,
gar and bowfin). Also, in many cases a strikingly increased
evolutionary rate of at least one copy of the duplicated
genes might result in a basal position of this paralogous
cluster via LBA artifacts ("outgroup tree topology").
[49,62] rendering the phylogenetic reconstruction of the
ancient events (~400-350 MYA) difficult [63]. Previous
studies have shown that the most likely position of the 3R
genome duplication event is after the divergence of gar/
bowfin (Holostei) from the teleost lineage [44-46].

Hexokinase
Glycolytic enzymes are often expressed in a tissue-specific
manner. For example, the different types of vertebrate HK
(Figure 5A), each with distinct kinetic properties, are
expressed in different kinds of tissue. HK 1 is the predominant isoenzyme in the vertebrate brain, HK 2 predominates in muscle tissue, and HK 4 in hepatocytes and
pancreatic islets. The kinetic properties of these three
isoenzymes are well adapted to the roles of glucose phosphorylation in the different cell types [64]. Both HK 1 and
HK 2 are saturated at glucose concentrations in the normal physiological range for blood, and thus their kinetic
activity is largely unaffected by variations. When the availability of glucose is pathologically low, it is more important to satisfy the glucose needs of the brain than those of
other tissues, and a low Km of HK 1 allows it to perform at
low glucose concentrations. The kinetic behavior of HK 4,
which requires high concentrations of glucose for maximal activity, is very different, but this is in agreement with
functions in liver and pancreas cells as regulators of
blood-glucose concentration [65,66]. The function of HK
3 is inhibited by excess glucose [67], the reason for this is
still not fully understood.

Based on the phylogeny reconstructed here (Figure 5A) as
well as previous reports [64], HK 4 is the oldest member

Page 7 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2006, 4:16

of this gene family. HK 4 consists of a 50-kDa fragment,
whereas the other HKs have a size of 100 kDa. A more
detailed analysis with separately considered amino and
carboxy termini suggests that a fusion event led to the
present isoenzymes [64]. We were also able to document
a fish-specific duplication of HK 1, however, nothing is
known about possible functional consequences due to
their duplication in terms of sub- or neofunctionalization.
Phosphoglucose isomerase
PGI is a multifunctional protein, also known as neuroleukin (NLK), autocrine mobility factor (AMF), or differentiation and maturation mediator. Although it was
proposed that the multiple functions of PGI were gained
gradually by amino-acid changes [68], an alternative
hypothesis is that PGI is recruited by other proteins for
novel functions during evolution [69]. Two lines of evidence support this hypothesis. First, the protein is highly
constrained, and second, Bacillus PGI not only can replace
the glycolytic aspects of the enzyme, but also fulfil NLK
and AMF functions in mammalian cells[70,71]. The multiple functions were proposed to be innate characteristics
of PGI at the origin of the protein [69]. The novel functions of PGI might have evolved by cellular compartmentalization of the protein, dimerization, and evolution of
its receptors. The enzyme is found to be active as a dimer
in glycolysis. It is not clear whether it is active in its other
functions as a monomer or as an oligomer. This multifunctionality and the possible function as an oligomer
might explain the retention of two copies in the fish lineage. The topology (Figure 4A) suggests that the only geneduplication event of PGI occurred in ray-finned fish
before the diversification of Acanthopterygii but after the
split of ray-finned fish and tetrapods.
Phosphofructokinase
The PFK gene family is composed of four different genes
(Figure 2A): They are expressed in liver (PFK1), muscle
(PFK2), brain (PFK3) and platelets (PFK4) [27]. These
genes differ both in size and physico-chemical properties,
and are also expressed in varying amounts in different tissues. PFK occurs in a variety of oligomeric forms from
dimer to tetramer to octamer and even larger forms. The
vertebrate enzyme, however, is active as a tetramer.
Because the subtypes can associate randomly, each tissue
contains not only homotetrameric enzymes, but also various types of heterotetramers. These different assemblies
of subunits result in complex isoenzymic populations
with a wide variety of kinetic properties [72]. It seems
likely that the copies result from 2R. The number of possibilities of PFK combinations in ray-finned fish is even
higher because of 3R (PFK1, PFK2, PFK4). The functional
significance of the complicated quaternary structure of
PFK is not entirely clear, but probably relates to the
requirement for specific responsive control properties for

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/16

this enzyme. A wide range of effector molecules have been
described [73-75], and some forms of the enzyme can be
also regulated by phosphorylation [76-78].
Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase
The three FBA isoenzymes A, B, C in vertebrates [79] also
have a tissue-specific distribution [80,81]. FBA A, which is
the most efficient in glycolysis, is the major form present
in muscle. FBA B seems to function in gluconeogenesis
and is only expressed in liver and kidney, where it is the
predominant form. FBA C, with intermediate catalytic
properties, is found in the brain. In the FBA tree (Figure
5C), the lamprey sequences preceded the first duplication,
while the Agnatha clade in the ENO analyses (Figure 3A)
clusters with one branch of the duplication. Statistical
support for the nodes around 2R and the divergence of
cyclostomes, however, is high. Multiple sequences from
Chondrostei (sharks and rays) for FBA, which are clearly
grouped with the three paralogous groups, suggest a timing of the duplications before their separation from the
Osteichthyes lineage. Within the fish lineage, FBA A was
duplicated before the divergence of Ostariophysii
(zebrafish) and Neoteleostei (medaka, pufferfish). However, in the FBA C subtree, gar and bichir are grouped
within one paralogous group. Either one paralogous copy
for gar and bichir of this gene has not been found yet, or
this reconstruction is due to a reconstruction artifact
caused by the extremely fast-evolving sequences of the teleost sequences (zebrafish and pufferfishes), which get
drawn to the basis (LBA).
Triosephosphate isomerase
TPI is highly conserved in sequence, structure, and enzymatic properties [82]. The enzyme is functional as a
homodimer. The topology (Figure 4B) suggests that the
only gene-duplication event of TPI occurred in ray-finned
fish before the diversification of Acanthopterygii but after
the split of ray-finned fish and tetrapods. This corroborates the results of a previous study [83] supporting a single gene duplication event early in the evolution of rayfinned fish. Comparisons between inferred ancestral TPI
sequences indicated that the neural TPI isozyme evolved
through a period of positive selection, resulting in the
biased accumulation of negatively charged amino acids. If
both copies are coexpressed, TPI could act as heterodimer
in fish with consequences in specificity or enzyme kinetics.
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
GAPDH is the most highly conserved of all glycolytic
enzymes. The rate of evolution of the catalytic domain, for
example, is only 3% per 100 million years [27]. Thus,
these domains in eukaryotic and eubacterial enzymes are
>60% identical. Due to this constraint we had to include
basal animal lineages (arthropods, flatworms, nematodes

Page 8 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2006, 4:16

and mollusks) into the analysis to clearly identify the origins of two copies of GAPDH (Figure 2B). The GAPDH
acts as a tetramer, however, it is not clear whether this is
constituted out of two different isoenzymes in vertebrates
similar to the PFK composition. There is evidence for an
ancient duplication around the bilaterian origin; however, the testis-specific copy was found only in vertebrates,
which makes this scenario rather unlikely. It has been
hypothesized that vertebrates acquired a second copy,
only expressed in the testis, by retroposition [84,85].
However, many more new gene copies were created, most
of which, if not all, seem to be pseudogenes [42,86,87].
This might be also the case for the muscle-specific form,
which only occurs in primates. Despite the possibility of
requiring variability by composing heterotetramers with
additional isoenzymes, it is also possible that paralogs are
retained because GAPDH is also involved in the maintenance of specific subcellular structures, e.g. the bundling
of microtubules [88].
Phosphoglycerate kinase
The quaternary structure of most glycolytic enzymes has
been well conserved during evolution. Monomeric forms
are unusual, and one enzyme that is invariably a monomer is phosphoglycerate kinase. In mammals, two different, but functionally similar isoenzymes for
phosphoglycerate kinase have been detected. One form
occurs in all somatic cells predominantly in the liver. The
other form is only found in sperm cells [89]. The gene for
the major isoenzyme (pgk1) is X-linked. Expression of this
gene coincides with overall activity of the X chromosome.
Its transcription is thus constitutive, regardless of the cell
type, when the chromosome is active. When spermatogenic cells enter meiosis, the X chromosome is inactivated and the second gene (pgk2), which is autosomal
(chromosome 6 in humans), is expressed [90]. It has been
proposed that the pgk2 gene, which does not contain any
introns in contrast to pgk1, must have evolved from the
pgk1 gene by retroposition [89,91]. Our phylogenetic
analysis suggests that this must have happened early in
mammalian evolution (Figure 5B). Although weakly supported, the position of the wallaby sequence (Macropus
eugenii) implies that the duplication occurred before the
divergence of placental mammals and marsupials.
Phosphoglycerate mutase
In the cofactor-dependent PGAM gene family, three paralogs can be found in all vertebrates. These isoenzymes are
expressed in a tissue-specific manner and have been classified as brain (PGAM1), muscle (PGAM2) and erythrocyte (BGAM) types. In some tissues, more than one gene
is active, resulting in multiple isoenzymes composed of
homo- and heterodimers [92]. The phylogenetic analyses
(Figure 3B) shows that the three isoenzymes found in vertebrates have evolved from a common ancestor by two

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/16

separate gene-duplication events. A PGAM3 form was proposed in human and chimp [93], probably as a result of
primate-specific gene duplication. Our findings suggest
that a more recent duplication gave rise to the PGAM1 and
PGAM2 copies. BLAST searches against the chicken
genome detected only the PGAM1 form. This could be
explained by gene loss of the PGAM2 gene in the avian
line, or by the incompleteness of the genome assembly. In
our phylogeny, the origin of PGAM predates the PGAM1
and PGAM2 divergence. This clarifies uncertainties of previous studies in unravelling the evolutionary history of
PGAM [27,48]. Vertebrate PGMs are rather versatile and
can catalyze three different reactions (they act as mutase,
synthase or phosphatase). Initially it was supposed that
each of these reactions was catalyzed by a different
enzyme, and it was quite surprising when it was realized
that the PGM could each catalyze all three of these reactions, albeit at substantially different rates [94]. One can
speculate that these differences in activity rates acted in
favor of the maintenance of several copies during evolution.
Enolase
For ENO three different isoenzymes also occur in vertebrate tissues, termed α, β and γ. The active enzyme is a
homo- or heterodimer. The α form is present in many tissues, especially in the liver, β predominates in muscle and
γ is only found in brain cells. The topologies for the gene
tree generally reflect the history of 2R/3R for ENO α (Figure 3A). However, the position of the Cyclostomata
sequences is not consistent and therefore offers no information about the relative timing of the duplication
events. One lamprey sequence precedes the first duplication, while the Agnatha clade in the ENO β analyses clusters with one branch of the duplication, however, there is
very little support. This is not in agreement with the current hypothesis of the relative timing of 2R [9]. Two functions have been attributed to ENO in addition to its
normal catalytic activity. First, ENO plays a structural role
in the eye lens. A major lens protein of lampreys, some
fishes and birds is τ-cristallin. This protein and α-ENO
appear to be identical [95-97]. The additional duplication
within the fish lineage in ENO α might provide a bigger
"toolbox" for this gene's function while retaining its glycolytic pathway role simultaneously. The additional role
that ENO may fulfill is the acquisition of thermal tolerance [98]. The Enolase genes are positioned in well
described paralogons of the human genome on chromosomes 1 (ENO α), 17 (ENO β) and 12 (ENO γ) [53], This
implies that they are resulting from a large-scale duplication event, probably a genome duplication.
Pyruvate kinase
It was originally expected that PK had four different isoforms encoded by four different genes. However, it is

Page 9 of 14
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Biology 2006, 4:16

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/4/16

known now that there are only two different genes: one
encoding the PK3 (m-form) isoforms and one for the PK1
(l and r forms) isoenzymes. Additional isoenzymes can
arise from differential RNA splicing. Therefore, the phylogeny (Figure 2C) is only considering one gene product
for each isoenzyme. The differences between the spliced
isoforms are too small to include into a phylogenetic analysis. Both copies seem to be derived from a duplication
event in early vertebrate history (1R or 2R) and are
expressed in a tissue-specific manner. PK1 is the most
abundant form in liver, where gluconeogenesis plays an
important role [99]. PK3 is the major form in tissues,
where glycolysis predominates such as muscle, heart and
brain. Both isoenzymes show different enzyme kinetics
according to their occurrence. The PK is active as a
tetramer, which is regulated by the thyroid hormone and
fructose 1,6-bisphosphate [100,101]. Usually PK is active
as homotetramer but in some cases, it also acts as a heterotetramer. This might be an explanation for why the copies of the fish-specific duplication in PK1 were retained
during evolution. As shown previously, the increase in
possible combinations of heterotetramers leads to
increased specificity in enzyme kinetics.

Conclusion
From our data, we could not detect a 1R/2R/3R trend consistent for all enzymes of the glycolytic pathway. Even
though most of them do show a repeated pattern of duplications, which are accompanied by tissue-specific expression, this is not the case for all of them. Considerations of
tertiary protein structure also could not give further indications for why some enzymes have four isozymes in
tetrapods and others only one. Given the expectation that
most genes get lost rather rapidly after a duplication event
[17,18], the tissue-specific expression might have led to an
increased retention for some genes since paralogs can subdivide the ancestral expression domain (subfunctionalization) or find new functions, which are not necessarily
related to the original function (neofunctionalization

[95]). This is, however, not true for all genes, and we can
conclude that the pathway is not evolving as a unit but
each gene follows its own history, as has been shown previously for Bacteria and Archaea [25,26]. For a better
understanding of the gene-duplication history, further
genome projects on a greater diversity of evolutionary lineages will be required.

Methods
Sequencing
ENO and FBA cDNAs for bichir Polypterus ornatipinnis,
sturgeon Acipenser baerii and caecilian Typhlonectes natans
were sequenced using degenerated primers designed
based on amino-acid alignments of previously known
sequences and the rapid amplification of cDNA end
(RACE) method to obtain complete coding sequences.
Total RNA was extracted from muscle tissue freshly frozen
in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Extractions were
performed with Trizol (Gibco, Germany). cDNA first
strand syntheses were done using the First Strand synthesis kit following the manufacturers manual (Gibco, Germany). A c-tailing step was added to allow 5' RACE.
Fragments were amplified using degenerate primers based
on the amino-acid sequences of previously reported
sequences. See Table 1 for sequences of degenerate primers. Amplification was performed in 50-µl reactions containing 0.5 units of RedTaq (Sigma, Germany), RedTaq
reaction buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mM KCl, 1.1
mM MgCl2, 0.01% gelatin), 0.2 µM of each primer
(MWG-Biotech AG, Germany, 0.4 mM dNTPs (Peqlab
Biotechnology, Germany) and 0.5 mM MgCl2. Cycle conditions included an initial denaturation step of 94°C,
then 35 cycles of 94°C for 10 seconds, 42°C for 1 minute
and 72°C for 2 minutes. Final extension was performed at
72°C for 5 minutes. PCR products were purified either
directly or, in cases of multiple bands, by cutting bands
from 1% agarose gels and using the QIAGEN spin system.
3' RACE reactions were performed with nested approaches
of two sequence-specific primers and the Not-I short

primer (AAC TGG AAG AAT TCG CGG CC). 5'RACE were
preformed with nested sequence specific primers and the
oligo-G primer binding the c-tail at the 5' end of the cDNA
(CTA GTA CGG GII GGG IIG GG). Sequences were confirmed by amplification and sequencing of both strands
of the complete coding sequences by specific primers
located in the 5' and 3' non-coding regions. Cycle
sequencing was performed using the ABI sequencing mix
and 35 cycles of 94°C for 10 seconds, 42°C – 50°C for 10
seconds and 68°C for 4 minutes. Sequences were run on
an ABI3100 capillary sequencer. Sequences were proofread and assembled using Sequence Navigator [102].
Database searches and sequence analyses
Protein sequences of pufferfishes (Tetraodon nigroviridis,
Takifugu rubripes) zebrafish (Danio rerio), human (Homo
sapiens), mouse (Mus musculus), rat (Rattus norvegicus)
chicken (Gallus gallus), claw frogs (Xenopus laevis, Xenopus
tropicalis), sturgeon (Acipenser
baerii), caecilian
(Typhlonectes natans), bichir (Polypterus sp.), lamprey
(Lethenteron sp, Eptatretus burgeri), shark (Cephaloscyllium
umbratile), and ray (Potamotrygon motoro) were obtained
from the Ensembl database [103] or by conducting BLAST
(BLASTp and translated BLAST) searches [104] against
GenBank. All accession numbers are listed in the supplementary data. Sequences were aligned with Clustal X
[105]. For each alignment, a preliminary tree was drawn.
This tree facilitated the identification of identical
sequences, sequences that varied only in length, and multiple sequences within species that differed by only few
amino acids, all of which were removed from the alignment. Draft trees were reconstructed from the remaining
sequences using Poisson-corrected genetic distances and
the neighbor-joining algorithm [106] in MEGA 3.0 [107].
If subsequent phylogenetic surveys provided an indication for fish-specific gene duplication, additional BLAST
searches were conducted to find more putative actinopterygian copies. With a few exceptions, human "reference
sequences" [108] were used as query sequences for the
BLAST searches. Species were surveyed one at a time to
improve the identification of a drop in sequence similarity, which was used as a "cut-off" criterion.

As outgroup sequences, we used data from Caenorhabditis
elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Ciona intestinalis. In
one case (GAPDH), we used data from Schistosoma mansoni and Crassostrea gigas as outgroup sequences. In
another case (PGK), we extended the dataset with protein
sequences from Oryzias latipes, Lepisosteus osseus, Rana sylvatica, Equus caballus, Sus scrofa, Bos taurus and Macropus
eugenii. Amino-acid data were analyzed using PHYML
[109] and the maximum-likelihood (ML) model, and
parameters were chosen based on ProtTest [110] analyses.
Confidence in estimated relationships of ML tree topologies was evaluated by a bootstrap analysis with 500 repli-

cates [111] and Bayesian methods of phylogeny inference.
Bayesian analyses were initiated with random seed trees
and were run for 200,000 generations. The Markov chains
were sampled at intervals of 100 generations with a burnin of 1000 trees. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were conducted with MrBayes 3.1.1 [112].
