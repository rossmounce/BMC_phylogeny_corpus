Background

Results

APOBEC3 (A3) is a cytidine deaminase gene with antiviral
activity. It was originally discovered as a human cell factor
that inhibits the replication of vif-defective HIV-1. A3 can
be packaged in virions and subsequently blocks infection
by causing G to A hypermutation following reverse transcription. Humans carry a tandem array of 7 hA3 genes
most of which have antiviral activity, whereas the mouse
has only a single copy. Several observations indicate that
mA3 functions in anti-viral defense: mA3 inhibits infection by several viruses including HIV-1, mA3 knockout
mice are more susceptible to MMTV infection and tumorigenesis, and mA3 restricts Friend MLV and virus-induced
disease and may encode the resistance factor Rfv3 (recovery from Friend virus 3). In Friend virus sensitive and
resistant mice, mA3 differs in expression level, splicing,
and protein sequence.

We found evidence for strong positive selection of mA3 in
Mus and identified 7 codons with very high posterior
probabilities (>0.99) of having evolved under positive
selection. Six of these codons are in two clusters in the Nterminal enzymatically active CDA (catalytically active
deaminase domain) of mA3, and both clusters include
codons that are polymorphic in the prototype Rfv3 resistant and susceptible mouse strains [1]. Codons at comparable positions in the active CDA of hA3G are critical for
deaminase activity. Sequence comparisons of virus resistant and susceptible mice also identified the presence of an
inserted sequence associated with mA3 that may contribute to alternative splicing and/or expression differences.
We describe the limited distribution of the Friend virus
restricting mA3 variant in inbred and wild mice.

Conclusion
Materials and methods
We sequenced mA3 genes from 21 inbred strains and wild
mouse species representative of the major taxonomic
groups of Mus. The sequences were used to construct a
phylogeny, and a free-ratio model was used to calculate
branch-specific ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous
substitutions. Likelihood ratio tests using different neutral
and selection models were used to test for positive selection and to identify codon positions subject to positive
selection.

Phylogenetic analysis suggests that mA3 has had an antiviral role throughout Mus evolution. We identified specific codons that may define sites of virus interaction as
well as an inserted sequence that might be responsible for
altered expression in virus resistant mice.
