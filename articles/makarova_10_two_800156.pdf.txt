DISCOVERY NOTES

Two new families of the FtsZ-tubulin protein
superfamily implicated in membrane remodeling
in diverse bacteria and archaea
Discovery notes

Kira S Makarova and Eugene V Koonin*

Abstract
Several recent discoveries reveal unexpected versatility of the bacterial and archaeal cytoskeleton systems that are
involved in cell division and other processes based on membrane remodeling. Here we apply methods for distant
protein sequence similarity detection, phylogenetic approaches, and genome context analysis to described two
previously unnoticed families of the FtsZ-tubulin superfamily. One of these families is limited in its spread to
Proteobacteria whereas the other is represented in diverse bacteria and archaea, and might be the key component of a
novel, multicomponent membrane remodeling system that also includes a Von Willebrand A domain-containing
protein, a distinct GTPase and membrane transport proteins of the OmpA family.

Reports section.
Findings
Proteins of the actin and tubulin superfamilies are major
components of the cytoskeleton in all 3 domains of life,
archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes [1,2]. FtsZ, the prokaryotic homolog of the eukaryotic cytoskeletal protein tubulin, is an essential protein that plays a central role in cell
division of most bacteria and archaea [2-4]. Both FtsZ
and tubulin undergo GTP- hydrolysis-dependent cycles
of polymerization and depolymerization. Structural and
biochemical analysis of both FtsZ and tubulin revealed
mechanisms and structural determinants of GTP-binding
and polymerization [5-7]. Recent progress in genome
sequencing revealed numerous FtsZ paralogs, especially
in archaea; some of these proteins lack the sequence
motifs known to be important for the FtsZ-tubulin function, so their biological roles in the respective organisms
remain obscure [8]. Furthermore, highly diverged FtsZ
homologs were discovered on plasmids in several Bacillus species. These proteins, RepX from the pXO1 plasmid
of Bacillus anthracis and TubZ from the Bacillus thuringiensis virulence plasmid pBtoxis, are required for plasmid
replication and stability [9,10]. The diversity and func* Correspondence: koonin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

tional flexibility of the FtsZ/tubulin superfamily suggests
that additional families might surface when more
genomic sequences become available. Here we report two
new FtsZ-like protein families found in archaea and bacteria. One of these families is associated with a set of
genes that can be predicted to encode multiple components of a novel molecular machinery for membrane
remodeling.
Identification of new FtsZ-tubulin families

Analysis of the gene context of cell division related genes
in archaea, including serine/threonine protein kinases
(PK) implicated in FtsZ phosphorylation, revealed a locus
in Halorhabdus utahensis (Huta_2050-Huta_2056) that,
along with 3 PK genes, encompassed 3 additional "hypothetical genes" which we further examined using distant
sequence similarity search methods. For the 1051 amino
acid long Huta_2051 protein, HHpred search [11] identified a statistically significant similarity (E-value = 1.4 ×
10-5) with the FtsZ protein from the hyperthemophilic
bacterium Thermotoga maritima (PDB:d1w5). The
region of similarity encompassed the N-terminal portions of these proteins and included several structural
elements of the nucleotide-binding core domain, in particular, the signature GTP-binding loop containing the
GGGTG(S/T)G motif [8,12]. The central portion of the

Huta_2051 protein (445-781 aa) consists of an extended
coiled-coil as predicted using the Marcoil program [13],
followed by a mostly α-helical globular domain according
to the secondary structure prediction made using the
PSIPRED program [14].
We performed an exhaustive PSI-BLAST search [15,16]
using the sequence of the N-terminal FtsZ-like domain of
Huta_2051 as the initial query to identify all representatives of the same protein family. In this search, we
detected 8 proteins from archaea and 113 proteins from
bacteria, none of which has been previously annotated as
FtsZ-like (Additional file 1). The majority of these proteins have the same organization as the Huta_2051 protein, namely, an N-terminal FtsZ-like domain, an
extended coiled-coil region, and a mostly α-helical C-terminal domain. Notably, 4 FtsZ-like proteins from Planctomycetes possess an additional N-terminal PK domain.
One of the previously unnoticed archaeal FtsZ-like proteins was detected in two closely related strains of the
crenarchaeaon Sulfolobus solfataricus (SSO1376). This is
the first observation of FtsZ/tubulin proteins in Crenarchaeota which apparently employ a distinct mechanism
of cell division centered around homologs of the eukaryotic ESCRT-III complex proteins [17-20]. The gene
encoding this protein in S. solfataricus is disrupted by a
transposon, most likely, as a result of a relatively recent
event, given that the protein sequence still retains the
GTP-binding motifs in the N-terminal domain. Consequently, this sequence could not be included in the phylogenetic analysis (see below). Nevertheless, this protein
clearly is quite diverged from other archaeal FtsZ
sequences and might be also functionally distinct given
the presence of transmembrane helices at the N-terminus. It seems likely that this protein is first discovered
representative of a crenarchaea-specific subfamily of
FtsZ-like proteins, additional members of which are likely
to be detected when more crenarchaeal genomes are
sequenced.
We further applied motif search, namely, searched for
the signature GTP-binding loop sequence GGGTG(S/
T)G of the FtsZ-tubulin superfamily in the Refseq database in an attempt to identify additional protein families
containing the FtsZ domain. In addition to the FtsZ families described previously [8,9] and the family reported
above, we detected another previously unknown family.
This family can be typified by the PFL_1302 protein from
Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 and is encoded in the
genomes of several other Proteobacteria (Additional file
1). For PFL_1302, HHpred search identifies statistically
significant similarity (E-value = 0.0033) with the profile
for PF00091 which includes the GTPase domain of the
Tubulin-FtsZ family, revealing conservation of all structural elements of the nucleotide-binding core domain
[12]. Thus, we identified two previously unnoticed fami-

lies of FtsZ-like proteins; the first, widespread family was
denoted FtsZ-like 1 (FtsZl1) and the second, proteobacterial family FtsZ-like 2 (FtsZl2). Unlike the FtsZl1 family,
the FtsZl2 proteins do not contain a coiled-coil domain
but instead possess a ~300 aa C-terminal region with a
predicted mixed α/β structure for which no similarity
with other protein families was detected.
To compare the two new families of FtsZ-like proteins
with the previously described families, we examined in
detail the multiple alignment of a representative set of
sequences from FtsZ-tubulin families (Figure 1). Both
new families possess several family-specific inserts in the
region between the highly conserved structural elements
located in loops T1 and T4 (see also the complete alignment in Additional file 2). The FtsZl2 family contains all
conserved motifs of the nucleotide-binding domain
including functionally important loops T1, T4, T6 and
T7, and the connector helix H7, whereas in the FtsZl1
family, counterparts to the T6-H7 structural elements
could not be confidently identified. In this case, the most
distal structural element that could be reliably aligned is
the H5 helix (Figure 1). Furthermore, the secondary
structure prediction for the FtsZl1 family was not fully
compatible with the known structure of the S6-T7 region
of the nucleotide-binding and connector domains (Additional File 2). Along the same lines, we did not detect any
similarity between the C-terminal domain of the FtsZl1
family and C-terminal domains of previously characterized FtsZ-tubulin superfamily proteins. These structural
elements have been shown to contribute to the formation
of FtsZ filaments [6]. Accordingly, the FtsZl1 proteins
might form filaments via a novel mechanism or, less
likely, might not form filaments at all. In general, the
FtsZl2 and especially FtsZl1 families seem to include the
most structurally diverged proteins in the entire FtsZtubulin superfamily and therefore are of particular interest for further structural and functional analysis.
Phylogenetic analysis of the FtsZ-tubulin superfamily

To characterize the relationships between the new Ftzl1
and FtsZl2 families and the rest of the FtsZ-tubulin proteins, we employed the alignable blocks of the FtsZ-tubulin nucleotide-binding domain to construct a tree for a
representative set of sequences from all families, with a
special emphasis on FtsZl1 and FtsZl2 (103 sequences in
total, including 41 from the FtsZl1 family and 10 from the
FtsZl2 family) (Figure 2A). Generally, the tree topology
reproduces all previously established major branches and
relationships between them [8,9]. These include the
monophyletic bacterial FtsZ and eukaryotic α,β,γ tubulin
branches, 3 major archaeal clades, and distinct branches
for the RepX and TubZ families, suggesting that the alignment of the nucleotide-binding domains contains sufficient information for phylogenetic inference.

corresponding protein are indicated for each sequence. Key elements of secondary structure based on known FtsZ tertiary structures are shown on
two lines above the alignment [6,12,44]. The evolutionarily conserved functional motifs of the FtsZ and tubulin families are shown underneath the
alignment for the corresponding groups [8,9]. The alignment columns are colored on the basis of the respective position conservation throughout
the superfamily: yellow background indicates hydrophobic residues (ACFILMVWY), red letters indicate polar residues (DEHKNQR), blue letters indicate

The FtsZl1 and FtsZl2 families clearly form distinct
branches; the respective branch lengths are comparable
to those seen for the plasmid-born TubZ and RepZ family
and eukaryotic tubulins (original tree is available in the

the archaeal branch of the FtsZl1 family is confidently
separated from the bacterial branch. To further assess
this observation, we constructed a separate FtsZl1 family

tree is available in Additional file 4). Despite the formally

low bootstrap values for the separation of the archaeal
and bacterial branches, the tree includes a strongly supported (90%) branch that includes all bacterial sequences
except for two sequences from Polaromonas naphthalenivorans and Methylacidiphilum infernorum V4. However, the neighborhoods of the FtsZl1 gene in these two
bacteria resemble those in other bacteria, so there are no
indications of horizontal gene transfer between archaea
and bacteria within this family. The FtsZl1 family is represented in most of the major bacterial lineages, with the
notable exception of the hyperthermophiles Thermatogales and Aquificales. The tree of the bacterial part
of the Ftzl1 family shows likely case of both horizontal
gene transfer and long term vertical inheritance. The vertical evolutionary pattern is particularly characteristic of
the Planctomycetes, actinobacteria and cyanobacteria, all
of which form distinct clades. Thus, despite the patchy
distribution of the FtsZl1 family, the results of phylogenetic analysis suggest that this family evolved as a result
of an ancient duplication that might even antedate the
last universal common ancestor of cellular life forms.
The genomic context of the new FtsZ-like families and
functional implications

To shed light on the potential roles of the newly detected
families of FtsZ-like proteins in archaea and bacteria and
their functional associations with other proteins, we analyzed the genomic context of the respective genes. Given
that the new FtsZ-like families are typically present in the
respective genomes along with conventional FtsZ, it
seems unlikely that the FtsZl1 or FtsZl2 are directly
involved in cell division. The genomic context analysis
revealed a putative distinct molecular machinery associated with the FtsZl1 family (Figure 2C and Additional file
5). The predicted operon organization generally correlates with the topology of the phylogenetic tree of the
FtsZl1 proteins. The majority of the predicted operons, in
addition to the FtsZl1 family gene, contain a gene for a
protein containing a von Willebrand factor type A (vWA)
domain. VWA domain-containing proteins have been
studied primarily in eukaryotes and have been shown to
contribute to a variety of cellular functions such as basal
membrane formation, cell migration, cell differentiation,
adhesion, signaling, and chromosomal stability [21].
Often, vWA-domains are fused or interact with other
domains or proteins to form multiprotein complexes;
these interactions typically depend on divalent cations
[21]. Although many bacteria and some archaea encode
vWA-domain proteins, specific information on their
functions is scarce. The best characterized prokaryotic
vWA-domain proteins also contain an AAA+ ATPase
domain and function as Mg2+ and Co2+ chelatases that are
involved in protoporphyrin IX biosynthesis; these chelatases are represented in bacteria, archaea and chloro-

Page 5 of 9

plasts [22]. The vWA-domain proteins associated with
the FtsZl1 family are highly diverse and are fused to various, mostly, uncharacterized domains. Some of these
proteins contain predicted signal peptides and/or transmembrane segments, and could be secreted or membrane-associated. In the majority of these proteins, the
metal-binding loops of the vWA domain (the so-called
MIDAS motif, DxSxS [21]) are intact suggesting that conformational changes of these vWA domains are regulated
by divalent cations.
Other frequent components of the predicted vWA/
FtsZl1 operons are PKs and members of a diverged family
of predicted GTPases; most of the latter are annotated as
"hypothetical proteins" but contain clearly identifiable
sequence signatures of P-loop GTPases including the
Walker A and B motifs, and the TxKD signature GTPase
motif [23]. In bacteria, in contrast to archaea, these
GTPases typically are not membrane-associated but in
some cases are fused to other domains including a
domain related to the cysteine-rich domain [24] of the
chaperone protein DnaJ which is involved in protein
translocation through membranes [25].
In several genomes, the FtsZl1 genes are associated
with proteins containing OmpA family peptidoglycanbinding domains that are known to interact with both the
inner and the outer membrane of Proteobacteria (Figure
2C). These proteins form 8-14 stranded transmembrane
β-barrel domains and function as porins, adhesins or
enzymes such as the PagP acyltransferase [26-28].
Most of the other genes in the predicted operons containing FtsZl1 genes are lineage-specific and do not
encode any recognizable domains (Additional File 6).
Many of these proteins contain predicted transmembrane
regions suggesting that the respective multisubunit complexes are associated with membranes. In general, the
genomic contexts of the FtsZl1 genes suggest that these
proteins are central components of novel, uncharacterized protein complexes involved in membrane remodeling and vesicle biogenesis.
In a sharp contrast to the FtsZl1 genes, genes encoding
FtsZl2 family proteins are not associated with any other
genes, so no functional clues could be obtained as to their
likely functions.

Concluding remarks
Several recent findings indicate that bacterial and
archaeal cytoskeleton systems involved in cell division
and various other processes that involve membrane
remodeling are considerably more versatile than previously realized [1,2]. The most notable of these discoveries
arguably are the demonstration that ESCRT-III-like complexes are responsible for cell division in the hyperthemophilic Crenarchaeota of the order Sulfolobales and
probably Desulfurococcales [17,18,20]; the demonstration

Makarova and Koonin Biology Direct 2010, 5:33
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/33

of the diversity of cytoskeleton systems in the Planctomycete-Verrucomicrobia-Chlamydia superphylum of bacteria [29]; and the detection of highly conserved homologs
of the eukaryotic actins in the third crenarchaeal order,
Thermoproteales [30]. In addition, the formation of exosome-like vesicles during stress response and virus egress
from infected cells has been reported in Sulfolobales as
[31,32], and DNA-containing vesicles have been observed
in some Thermococci [33]. The actin homolog MamK
plays a role in the subcellular location of magnetosomes,
membrane-bound organelles in the α-proteobacterium
Magnetospirillum madneticum [34]. In another α-proteobacterium, Caulobacter crescentus, a lineage-specific
protein, crescentine, is responsible for maintaining the
distinct cell shape [35]. In Spirochaetes and Myxococci,
intracellular filaments have been observed and implicated
in cell motility [2]. In many cases, the proteins that are
involved in the formation and functioning of these structures are unknown. Here we describe two FtsZ-like protein families which are candidates for involvement in
some of these functions. In particular, the FtsZl1 family is
most likely involved in a basic, ancient mechanism of
membrane remodeling, which often requires GTP hydrolysis and is regulated by PK. The analysis presented here
may trigger and facilitate experimental study of these
processes.

Methods
The NCBI Refseq database [36] was used for retrieval of
information on genomic context. For partially sequenced
genomes that are not represented in Refseq, the context
information was retrieved from the original nucleotide
GenBank files. Protein sequence database searches were
performed using PSI-BLAST [37] with an inclusion
threshold E-value of 0.01 and no composition-based statistical correction. In addition, distant similarity detection approaches were applied, namely, the conserved
domain database (CDD) search [38] and the HHpred
server that is based on the comparison of protein family
profiles using the Hidden Markov Model technique [11].
Multiple alignments of protein sequences were constructed by using the Promals3D program [39], followed
by a minimal manual correction on the basis of local
alignments obtained using PSI-BLAST [37] and HHpred
[11]. Protein secondary structure was predicted using the
PSIPRED program [14]. Signal peptides were predicted
using the SignalP program [40] and transmembrane
regions were predicted using the TMHMM software [41].
Maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees were
constructed by using the MOLPHY program [42] with
the JTT substitution matrix to perform local rearrangement of an original Fitch tree [43]. The MOLPHY program was also used to compute RELL bootstrap values.

Reviewer 1
Gáspár Jékely, Max Planck Institute for Developmental
Biology, Tübingen
This interesting paper describes two novel families
related to the filament forming FtsZ/tubulin proteins.
The identification of these novel families and the careful
analyses of the sequences already warrant publication.
Besides, the authors also provide useful information
about the genomic context of the novel FtsZ-like proteins
and propose that they may be involved in membrane
remodeling processes.
This is a very interesting possibility, but I think that it is
very difficult to decide based on the data, and there are
also alternative interpretations possible. Regarding the
membrane remodeling complexes formed by OmpA-like
proteins, von Willebrand factor type A domain proteins
and FtsZ-like proteins, it is unclear in what cellular context these could function together. Looking at the
genomic context data in their AF5 supplementary table, it
is clear that many of the FtsZl1 genes, in gram-negatives
at least, are associated with periplasmic and outer-membrane components. OmpA-like proteins are outer membrane proteins. Several of the proteins containing a von
Willebrand factor type A domain have a signal peptide
and are likely periplasmic (I only checked Corynebacterium glutamicum cgR_2627, Bacillus thuringiensis
konkukian BT9727_3336 and Micromonospora sp.
ATCC 39149 MCAG_00589, these all have a signal peptide). On the contrary, the FtsZl1 protein is likely cytoplasmic. Given the different subcellular localizations,
which of the two membranes could be remodeled in
Gram-negatives? A cytoplasmic FtsZ-like protein will not
form a complex with periplasmic and outer-membrane
proteins. Given this problem, it would be very useful to
provide the predicted cellular localization (cytoplasm,
outer membrane etc.) for all of the proteins listed in the
supplementary table AF5 and Figure 2C.
Authors' response

The predictions of cellular localization for the proteins
associated with the FtsZ homologs are given in Additional
File 6. The emerging picture is extremely complicated and
at present does not allow a detailed reconstruction of the
macromolecular organization of the respective complexes.
Given that all major predicted components of these complexes (vWA containing proteins, OmpA-like proteins, and
many other proteins encoded in the respective operons; see
Additional File 6) appear to be membrane-associated
(obviously, the distinction between the inner and outer
membrane is only relevant for Proteobacteria) and given
the accumulating evidence of the existence of diverse
membrane structures in prokaryotes (see text), we consider
the membrane remodeling hypothesis to most plausible
functional prediction for the FtsZl1 proteins. In Pro-

Makarova and Koonin Biology Direct 2010, 5:33
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/33

teobacteria that encode FtsZl1, it is the inner membrane
that might be remodeled with the participation of this protein.
It would be very useful to see a discussion about
whether these novel proteins are likely to form filaments,
a property necessary for membrane remodeling activity.
Could the additional C-terminal domains hinder filament
formation? Besides, FtsZl1 lacks the T6-H7 structural
elements. How does it fit to the known structure of the
FtsZ filaments?
Authors' response

This is indeed an interesting and important question. As
indicated in the text, FtsZl2 contains all structural elements characteristic of FtsZ-tubulin and can be confidently predicted to form filaments. The case of FtsZl1 is
different as these proteins seem to lack some of structural
elements required for filament formation. There are three
potential explanations for this: i) these elements are present but are extremely diverged and not identifiable by our
methods, ii) the FtsZl1 proteins employ a novel mechanism of filament formation, perhaps, mediated by their
unique C-terminal structures, iii) the FtsZl1 proteins do
not form filaments. A definitive choice between these possibilities will become feasible only as a result of experimental study of these proteins. Nevertheless, so far all
characterized FtsZ-tubulin superfamily proteins have
been shown to form filaments, so it seems likely to be their
intrinsic property. We have a clarification on this issue to
the text.
Given these difficulties with the functional predictions,
I would suggest to change the title and the abstract and to
provide a more careful discussion of the possible function
of these proteins.
Authors' response

We changed "predicted" to "might be" in the Abstract to
soften the stance. Nevertheless, as pointed out in the
response to the reviewer's comment above, we do consider
membrane remodeling the most likely function of these
proteins and accordingly were disinclined to modify the
title. The interested reader will be duly forewarned of the
possibility of alternative interpretations by the reviewer's
comments.
Glancing through the genomic context data, I would
propose, as an alternative to the authors' interpretation,
that FtsZl1 proteins may have a role in transmembrane
transport and/or signalling processes. For example in
Polaromonas naphthalenivorans the FtsZl1 protein is
associated with Pnap_3259 (TRAP-type uncharacterized
transport system protein, periplasmic component). This
protein has a signal sequence and a domain similar to the
periplasmic binding proteins (PBP), components of Tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) trans-

Page 7 of 9

porter systems. In Pirellula staleyi FtsZl1 is associated
with Psta_0487, a diguanylate phosphodiesterase,
involved in cyclic diguanylic acid (c-di-GMP) signalling,
regulating e.g. motility, biofilm formation and virulence.
In Thermosynechococcus elongatus FtsZl1 is associated
with tll1019, a PilA-like protein, involved in the general
secretion pathway for extracellular targeting of proteins
from the periplasm. In Bacteroides capillosus FtsZl1 is
associated with BACCAP_04120, an OEP family (Outer
membrane efflux protein) with a signal peptide and
periplasmic localization. In Arthrospira platensis FtsZl1
is associated with AplaP_010100009370, the periplasmic
component of an ABC-type branched-chain amino acid
transport system. There are also other examples that suggest a transport function.
Authors' response

Our hypothesis is based on a detailed analysis of the
genomic context. However, we relied only on those components of the FtsZl1 neighborhoods that are conserved in at
least a few genomes. We noticed the cases mentioned by
the reviewer, and most of them are listed in Additional File
5, along with a few additional ones; however, these genes
are represented in only one or several closely related
organisms and therefore cannot be unequivocally implicated in functionally important interactions with FtsZl1.

The authors of this manuscript unveil two previously
undescribed families of FtsZ/tubulin superfamily that are
widespread in prokaryotes and the Proteobacteria,
respectively. The use of distant protein similarity detection, phylogenetic and genome context analyses allowed
the detection of these new FtsZ-like families, FtsZl1 and
FtsZl2. Interestingly, one of these families is present in
Sulfolobus genomes, which were so far thought to lack
FtsZ/tubulin homologs. The detection of these distant
homologs to FtsZ/tubulins opens the way to their functional exploration and the evolution of cell division
mechanisms.
The observation of FtsZ-like proteins in Crenarchaeota
(Sulfolobus) is interesting. However, the corresponding
homologs do not appear in the phylogenetic analysis of
Figure 2. Are the proteins not alignable? It would be
interesting to know whether this is a case of horizontal
transfer or a vertically inherited homolog from the last
common ancestor.
Authors' response

The N-terminal portion of the FtsZ-like protein sequence
from Sulfolobus is perfectly alignable with other family
members. However, there is a transposon insertion imme-

Makarova and Koonin Biology Direct 2010, 5:33
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/5/1/33

diately following the GTP-binding loop, and the part of the
SSO1376 sequence after the transposon is partly disrupted
and poorly alignable (clearly, the protein was rather
recently inactivated). The best hit for the part of the protein corresponding to the GTP-binding domain comes
from an uncultured archaeon (GI: 268325165), so there is
no indication of a bacterial transfer. However, this is the
only archaeal FtsZl1 protein that is fused to a transmembrane region, so we believe that it has a distinct evolutionary history that hopefully will be elucidated when
additional FtsZl1 sequences with this type of domain
organization become available.
