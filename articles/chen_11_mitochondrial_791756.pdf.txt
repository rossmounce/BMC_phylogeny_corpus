The mitochondrial genome of Sinentomon
erythranum (Arthropoda: Hexapoda: Protura): an
example of highly divergent evolution

Abstract
Background: The phylogenetic position of the Protura, traditionally considered the most basal hexapod group, is
disputed because it has many unique morphological characters compared with other hexapods. Although
mitochondrial genome information has been used extensively in phylogenetic studies, such information is not
available for the Protura. This has impeded phylogenetic studies on this taxon, as well as the evolution of the
arthropod mitochondrial genome.
Results: In this study, the mitochondrial genome of Sinentomon erythranum was sequenced, as the first proturan
species to be reported. The genome contains a number of special features that differ from those of other hexapods
and arthropods. As a very small arthropod mitochondrial genome, its 14,491 nucleotides encode 37 typical
mitochondrial genes. Compared with other metazoan mtDNA, it has the most biased nucleotide composition with T
= 52.4%, an extreme and reversed AT-skew of -0.351 and a GC-skew of 0.350. Two tandemly repeated regions occur
in the A+T-rich region, and both could form stable stem-loop structures. Eighteen of the 22 tRNAs are greatly
reduced in size with truncated secondary structures. The gene order is novel among available arthropod
mitochondrial genomes. Rearrangements have involved in not only small tRNA genes, but also PCGs (protein-coding
genes) and ribosome RNA genes. A large block of genes has experienced inversion and another nearby block has
been reshuffled, which can be explained by the tandem duplication and random loss model. The most remarkable
finding is that trnL2(UUR) is not located between cox1 and cox2 as observed in most hexapod and crustacean groups,
but is between rrnL and nad1 as in the ancestral arthropod ground pattern. The “cox1-cox2“ pattern was further
confirmed in three more representative proturan species. The phylogenetic analyses based on the amino acid
sequences of 13 mitochondrial PCGs suggest S. erythranum failed to group with other hexapod groups.
Conclusions: The mitochondrial genome of S. erythranum shows many different features from other hexapod and
arthropod mitochondrial genomes. It underwent highly divergent evolution. The “cox1-cox2“ pattern probably
represents the ancestral state for all proturan mitogenomes, and suggests a long evolutionary history for the Protura.

Background
The Protura is a group of mysterious soil-dwelling
micro-arthropods (usually 0.5-2.0 mm in length), first
described by Silvestri in 1907 [1]. Traditionally, it was
regarded as a basal hexapod group, but it owns many
unique and primitive morphological characteristics

compared with other hexapods. For example, they lack
antennae and wings, the foretarsus are enlarged with
many sensilla serving the role of antennae, eyes and tentorium are absent, they have anamorphic post-embryonic development, and they have 12 abdominal segments
(instead of 11) [2]. The proturan spermatozoan has a
variable number of doublet microtubules (9-16), with no
accessory or central microtubules. It is different from
those of other hexapods, but similar to the sperm of sea
spider (Arthropoda: Pycnogonida). This probably reflects
a high diversification rate, or a lengthy evolution [3-5].

relationship of proturans to other hexapods, and their
evolutionary position in the Arthropoda [2,3,6-9]. This
is because proturans are understudied, being so small
and rare, making them difficult to collect, identify, culture and experiment on [2,10,11].
The higher-level phylogeny of the major arthropod
groups (Chelicerata, Myriapoda, Crustacea and Hexapoda) continues to be a matter of debate despite extensive research based on phylogenetic analysis and genetic
data [12-14]. Almost all molecular analyses strongly support the Pancrustacea hypothesis: crustaceans, instead of
myriapods, are the closest relatives of the hexapods
[15-18]. The Hexapoda (Insecta s. lat.), which includes
four groups, Protura, Collembola, Diplura and Insecta
(Insecta s. str.), was traditionally considered a monophyletic lineage based on the synapomorphies of body segments, six legs on the thorax, and adaptation to the
terrestrial environment. The monophyly of the Insecta
has been well established by morphological and molecular studies [8,10,17,18], but the monophyly of the Hexapoda is less certain [17,19]. Three basal hexapod groups
(Protura, Collembola and Diplura) show many different
features from insects according to morphology [10,20]
and ultrastructure of spermatozoa [4]. The mitogenomic
data of basal hexapod collembolans and diplurans reject
the monophyly of Hexapoda, and suggest that some
crustaceans are more closely related to the Insecta than
Collembola and Diplura [17,19,21]. However, recent studies based on EST data and nuclear genes (18S and 28S
ribosomal RNA genes, nuclear protein-coding
sequences) support the monophyly of the Hexapoda
[12,13,18].
The arthropod mitochondrial genome is a single circular DNA molecule encoding 13 proteins, 22 transfer
RNAs (tRNAs), two ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), and one
A+T-rich region for the control of replication and transcription of the mtDNA. It is used extensively for studying phylogenetic relationships at various taxonomic
levels. Unlike nuclear molecular markers, mtDNA is of
maternal inheritance, and does not experience intermolecular genetic recombination. In addition, the mitochondrial gene order can provide additional
phylogenetic information, since rearrangements appear
to be generally rare events, and most mitochondrial
gene arrangements often remain unchanged over a long
evolutionary period [22]. Mitogenomic data also strongly
support the Pancrustacea hypothesis [14,17,23], especially with the evidence of the gene order [16,24]. The
gene trnL2 (UUR) is located between rrnL and nad1 in
the ancestral arthropod ground pattern, but is translocated to the position between cox1 and cox2 in Pancrustacea [16]. It has been considered a distinctive
synapomorphic character for crustaceans and hexapods.
The mitochondrial genomes of basal hexapod

Collembola [25] and Diplura [26] also agree with the
“cox1-trnL2-cox2“ pattern. So far, no mitochondrial genome information is available for the Protura. This has
impeded comprehensive discussions on the evolution of
the arthropod mitochondrial genome, and the validity of
using mtDNA to study the phylogeny of the Hexapoda
[27-29].
In this study, we sequenced the complete mitochondrial genome of Sinentomon erythranum (Protura:
Sinentomata: Sinentomidae), to describe the molecular
features of the proturan mitochondrial genome, to judge
how these evolved, and to see if it has any phylogenetic
information, which may help resolve the discrepancy on
the monophyly of the Hexapoda between mitochondrial
and nuclear DNA markers.

Results and Discussion
General description of the mitochondrial genome of S.
erythranum

The mitochondrial genome of S. erythranum (GenBank
accession HQ199311) encodes 37 genes, which is consistent with metazoan mitochondrial DNA structure (Figure 1 and Table 1). However, the total size of the
genome is only 14,491 base pairs, smaller than most

Protein-coding and ribosomal RNA genes are indicated with
standard abbreviations, transfer RNA (tRNA) genes are designated by
a single letter for the corresponding amino acid except for those
coding for leucine and serine, which are labeled with their
anticodon as well (Luag, Luaa, Sgcu and Suga). Arrows indicate
direction of coding regions either on the J-strand (clockwise, 29
genes) or the N-strand (counterclockwise, eight genes) (after Simon
2006). The five tRNAs encoded by the N-strand are indicated by a
(-) sign (for example -F). A+T region refers to the non-coding region
that may be related to the regulation of mitochondrial replication
and transcription. TRR stands for tandemly repeated region.

tRNAs have only 53 nucleotides (trnA-ugc, trnH-gug,
trnV-uac). The average size of all 22 tRNAs is less than
57 nucleotides. All 13 PCGs have the typical ATN start
codon, and have either complete (TAA or TAG) or
incomplete stop codons (TA (A), TA-, T–). The incomplete stop codons are presumably polyadenylated after
transcription to form complete TAA stop codons [31].
The stop codons of several PCGs have an adenine (A)
overlap with the next PCG’s start codons. Such overlap
is located at the junction of cox1/cox2, atp8/atp6, atp6/
cox3 and nad4L/nad4 (Table 1).

Strand asymmetry (also called strand composition bias)
is a remarkable feature of animal mitochondrial genomes. The overall mitogenomic AT-content of S. erythranum is 77.6%, which shows a strong bias towards A
and T, and is well within the normal range of arthropod
mtDNAs. The nucleotide frequency of the J-strand is T
= 0.524, A = 0.252, G = 0.151, C = 0.073. Therefore, T
is much more abundant than A, and G is more abundant than C. The AT-skew and GC-skew of the J-strand
for S. erythranum are -0.351 and 0.350, respectively.
They are extreme and reversed compared with those of
most arthropods, which instead have a positive AT-skew
and negative GC-skew (Figure 2A). The reversed value
of AT-skew and GC-skew may indicate altered replication orientation of mtDNA in the A+T- rich region
[32]. The skew value is the farthest of all from the coordinates (Figure 2A), meaning this proturan mitogenome
has the most biased nucleotide composition ever
reported for arthropods. The mitogenomic AT-skew
value of S. erythranum (-0.351) is the most negative of
all reported mitochondrial genomes, much lower than
the second most-negative value from the American
house dust mite Dermatophagoides farinae (NC_013184,
AT-skew -0.253). For GC-skew, only the values of the
small pigeon louse Campanulotes bidentatus
(NC_007884, GC-skew 0.381) and tarantula Calisoga
longitarsis (NC_010780, GC-skew 0.365) are slightly
higher than the 0.350 of S. erythranum. It is unusual to
find so many poly Ts within mitochondrial protein-coding sequences. For instance, a poly T motif in cox3 contains 27 continuous Ts, which results in the frequent
use of TTT (F) codons. The exact reason for the occurrence of this motif remains unknown. In any case, the
mitogenomic sequence of S. erythranum should be a
good model for studying the mechanism of the base-frequency bias.
Figure 2B shows the nucleotide composition, ATskew and GC-skew for each of the 13 PCGs and two
rRNA genes of the mitochondrion of S. erythranum.
Cox1 has the lowest AT content (70.2%) and atp8 has
the highest AT content (85.6%). The AT content of

hexapod mitochondrial genomes, but similar in size to
those of some spiders and mites (for example, the spider
Habronattus oregonensis 14381 bp, NC_005942). Most
of the genes are encoded by the majority strand (Jstrand, Simon et al. [30]), and only eight genes are
encoded by the opposite strand (N-strand): five tRNAs
and three protein-coding genes (PCGs) (nad5, nad4,
nad4L). The gene order differs from that of the mitochondrial genomes of all sequenced arthropods, and
most tRNA genes are reduced (Table 1). trnW-uca is
the largest tRNA with 68 nucleotides, and the shortest

these 15 genes does not fluctuate far from the overall
average AT content (77.6%). Nad3 has the most negative AT-skew (-0.685), and nad4 and rrnS share the
least extreme AT-skew (-0.204). The AT-skew values
of the adjacent genes nad5, nad4 and nad4L are less

extreme than in other adjacent genes, and all three of
these genes are encoded by the minority strand, so it
seems that some constraints shaped the genome that
evolved under a strong directional mutation pressure
(Figure 2B) [33].

A+T-rich region

The largest non-coding region (993 bp, Table 1), named
the A+T-rich region in arthropods, is located between
nad6 and cob (Figure 1), with a very high A+T content
of 91.4% (Figure 3). There are two G-stretches (consisting of seven Gs each) at 5’ of the A+T-rich region. The
A+T-rich region contains two tandemly repeated
regions (TRRs): TRR1 (11 × 10 bp) and TRR2 (13.7 ×
35 bp). The repeat units are ‘TTTTGTTAAA’ for TRR1
and ‘TACTTATAATGTAAAATATTTAATATCAATTTAAA’ for TRR2. All 11 repeat units are exactly the
same in TRR1, but for TRR2, only 11 repeat units are
identical. Both TRRs can form stable stem-loop secondary structures (bottom of Figure 3). We noticed that the
length of the A+T-rich region shows heteroplasmy at an
intraspecific level [34]. Three kinds of length variations
were detected by PCR amplification of the A+T-rich
region from different individuals. The length heteroplasmy of the A+T-rich region is further confirmed by
sequencing the PCR products after cloning. The copy
number of TRR2 does vary in different individuals.
Transfer RNAs

The predicted secondary structures indicate that most
tRNAs in our sequence have truncated structures (Figure 4). Among the 22 tRNAs, 15 of them lack a TΨC
loop, and trnS-gcu, trnY and trnC lack the dihydrouridine (DHU) arm. The lack of the DHU arm in trnSgcu is very common in metazoan mitochondrial genomes [35,36]. trnC is coded by the J-strand and shares
18 nucleotides with trnW, which is coded by the Nstrand. Studies on nematode mtDNAs have proven
that extremely reduced tRNAs, like those of S. erythranum, can function properly [37,38]. The extensive

loss of the cloverleaf structures of tRNAs has been
found in many groups of nematodes and arachnids
[35,39,40], but to our knowledge, so many abnormal
tRNA secondary structures within one mitochondrial
genome have only been detected in very few hexapods,
such as gall midges (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) [41].
This suggests the independent origin of these truncated tRNA structural features in S. erythranum
[38,41].
Gene rearrangements and possible evolutionary
mechanisms

Compared with the arthropod ground pattern (e.g.
Limulus polyphemus), 11 of 37 genes in our proturan
sequence have been rearranged: eight tRNA genes (trnF,
trnV, trnL2, trnL1, trnP, trnY, trnQ, and trnM), two
rRNA genes (rrnS and rrnL) and one PCG (nad1). The
rearrangements can be divided into five categories (Figure 5): 1) the translocation of trnF; 2) the remote translocation and inversion of trnP; 3) the local inversion of
the gene block (rrnS, trnV, rrnL, trnL2, trnL1, and
nad1); 4) the reshuffle of the tRNA gene region from
trnI to trnC; 5) the relocation of the A+T-rich region.
Rearrangements 1 and 2: the translocation of trnF may
be an independent event, and this kind of minor rearrangement is very common in mtDNA [42,43]. The trnP
changed its coding strand from N to J during its “long
range” translocation, and this situation is rarely
reported.
Rearrangements 3 and 4: The tandem duplication and
random loss (TDRL) model is a popular hypothesis for
explaining many mtDNA gene rearrangements [44-46].
Here, it can readily explain the reshuffling of tRNAs in
the region from trnI to trnC (rearrangement 4 in Figure
5), although it does not explain the gene inversion (rearrangement 3 in Figure 5). For that inversion, the implication is strong that the gene block “rrnS-V-rrnL-trnL2trnL1-nad1“ was locally reversed as a whole. Gene inversions are probably the result of intra-molecular recombination, which can not only rearrange parts of the
genome but also invert them at the same time. In the
mitogenomic sequence of S. erythranum, both gene
relocation and inversion must have occurred, although
it is uncertain which of these two processes dominated.
Here, we have some new thoughts. For the TDRL
model, gene duplication is necessary, which can be
achieved by replication slippage in single stranded templates. At the same time, a loop must be produced by
slippage, so it is possible for the loop to perform intramolecular recombination simultaneously [47]. Namely,
the reshuffling of tRNAs and local inversion of a gene
block may happen together in a stepwise rearrangement
process. We further checked available mitochondrial
genomes, and found that recombination involving PCGs

has rarely occurred in hexapods, except in some lice
whose mitochondrial genomes were extensively shuffled
[48].
Rearrangement 5: it is not easy to explain the translocation of the A+T-rich region. There is a hint of an

orientation change of replication due to the nucleotidebias change from the majority type (AT-skew and GCskew) (Figure 2A), but it is hard to explain it as a consequence of the inversion of gene block “rrnS-V-rrnLtrnL2-trnL1-nad1“.

Genes encoded by the reverse strand are indicated by a dark line under the gene name with blue shadow. Red areas indicate genes that were
rearranged, and circle arrows indicate inversion. The rearrangements are divided into five categories: 1) the translocation of trnF; 2) the remote
translocation and inversion of trnP; 3) the local inversion of the gene block (rrnS, trnV, rrnL, trnL2, trnL1, and nad1); 4) the reshuffle of tRNAs
region from trnI to trnC, which is compatible with the TDRL hypothesis; that is, duplication of the ancestral gene block from trnI to trnY can get
the exact order of S. erythranum’s mtDNA in this region after loss of shadowed genes; 5) the relocation of the A+T-rich region.

Position of trnL2(UUR) and its phylogenetic implications

The mitochondrial gene order of S. erythranum differs
greatly from the pancrustacean ground pattern (Figure
5). The most remarkable finding is that trnL2 is not
located between cox1 and cox2. The “cox1-trnL2-cox2“
pattern was supposed to be a strong molecular evidence
to support the Pancrustacea hypothesis [22]. trnL2 is
located between rrnL and nad1 in the arthropod ground
pattern, but is translocated to the position between cox1
and cox2 in crustaceans and hexapods. In our proturan
sequence, trnL2 is found between rrnL and nad1, adjacent to trnL1 (trnL-tag). This is almost, but not quite,
the arthropod ground pattern, that is, given the premise
that the gene block “rrnS-V-rrnL-trnL2-trnL1-nad1“
inverted as a whole, trnL2 and trnL1 must have changed
their relative position compared with the arthropod
ground pattern (Figures 5, 6). The gene sequences of
trnL2 and trnL1 of S. erythranum are very similar (78%
sequence identity, see detailed comparison between
trnL1 and trnL2 in Additional File 1), so probably one
trnL was copied from the other. This process can be
explained by a mutational remolding hypothesis [49-51].
More mispairs appear in trnL-uag (trnL1) than in trnLuaa (trnL2) (Additional File 1), so the trnL-uaa (trnL2)
was most likely duplicated, and then one of the copies
changed to trnL-uag by a random point-mutation of the
anticodon triplet. After that, the original tRNA gene
would have become a pseudogene or degenerated, so
that the new trnL-tag replaced its function next to trnL-

taa. In general, it cannot get a right paired tRNA duplicate from a wrong template, so we consider this as an
evidence that trnL2 located between rrnL and nad1 is
the ancestral state. Mitochondrial genomes of other
basal hexapods (Diplura and Collembola) match the
pancrustacean pattern of cox1-trnL2-cox2 [25,26]. Thus,
the proturan S. erythranum is the only known hexapod
whose trnL2 is in the ancestral arthropod position.

HQ416715), Eosentomon nivocolum of Eosentomata
(GenBank accession HQ416716), and Zhongguohentomon piligeroum of Eosentomata (GenBank accession
HQ416714). They all agree with the cox1-cox2 pattern
and have no intervening trnL2. In addition, cox1 is the
exact neighbor to cox2 with no nucleotide between
them in S. erythranum, B. tianmushanensis and E. nivocolum, and only four intergenic nucleotides in Z. piligeroum. Therefore, based on the available data, we believe
it is more reasonable to conclude that the ancestral
state is the cox1-cox2 pattern for all proturan mtDNAs.
The “cox1-trnL2-cox2“ pattern occurs in almost all
hexapods. We compared all published data of arthropod
mitogenomes (available until January 16, 2011), and
found only eight of 226 mtDNAs of Insecta are not consistent with this pattern (Figure 6 and Additional File 2),
but they are clearly secondary mtDNA rearrangements
or with multiple trnL2 copies. Five of them are from the
Hemiptera, three parasitic lice from the Phthiraptera
(Bothriometopus macrocnemis, C. bidentatus compar
and Heterodoxus macropus) [52,53], one bark louse
from the Psocoptera (Lepidopsocid sp. RS-2001) and one
species from the Thysanoptera (Thrips imaginis) [54].
Their mitochondrial gene arrangements are reshuffled
rigorously. The other three exceptions are from the
Hymenoptera (Vanhornia eucnemidarum, Abispa ephippium and Diadegma semiclausum) [48]. It was noticed
that in Hymenoptera, tRNA rearrangements (termed
minor rearrangements) are very common, especially in
the hot-spot areas [55]. In Abispa ephippium, trnL2 has
four copies, but is still located between cox1 and cox2
[48]. However, most hemipteran and hymenopteran
mtDNAs are still consistent with the cox1-trnL2-cox2
pattern. In Crustacea, only nine of 60 mitochondrial
genomes are not consistent with the cox1-trnL2-cox2
pattern (Additional File 2). In addition, only seven of 53
mitochondrial genomes from the Chelicerata are not
consistent with the cox1-cox2 pattern (Additional File
2), and all eight reported mitochondrial genomes from
the Myriapoda are consistent with the cox1-cox2 pattern
(Figure 6).
These statistics reflect the fact that translocation of
trnL2 out of the cox1/cox2 junction has rarely happened
within Pancrustacea lineage, and no case of the cox1trnL2-cox2 pattern was detected within Myriapoda and
Chelicerata lineages, whose trnL2 tends to stay between
rrnL and nad1. This information leads to a single plausible scenario of the ancestral state being cox1-trnL2-cox2
in the Hexapoda, but the proturan mitochondrial

Page 8 of 12

genomes likely retain the ancestral state of the Arthropoda, the cox1-cox2 pattern. This seems to cast new
doubt on the monophyly of Hexapoda. The Protura
probably has a very ancient origin and a long evolutionary history, with distant affinity to other hexapods, evolving even earlier than other pancrustaceans. However,
we cannot exclude the possibility of the secondary
reversion to the primitive arthropod condition in the
proturan ancestor since our gene sequence is so highly
divergent. In this case, the mtDNA of S. erythranum
provides a remarkable example of secondary reversion.
Phylogenetic position of Protura

Since the position of trnL2 cast doubt on the relationship between the Protura and other hexapods, it is
important to verify it with a phylogenetic tree. As
revealed in Figure 2A, the base composition of S. erythranum is so different from that of most arthropod
mitochondrial genomes, long-branch attraction (LBA)
can be expected. Translating the PCGs into amino acid
sequences is an effective method of dealing with the
problem caused by base compositional heterogeneity in
tree reconstruction [14,17,56], so we performed all phylogenetic analyses on conceptually translated amino acid
data of 13 mitochondrial PCGs using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference methods.
In the ML and Bayesian trees, S. erythranum displayed
a remarkable long-branch, and clustered with other
long-branches (Figure 7A). The AT-skew and GC-skew
plot reveals that Hutchinsoniella macracantha, Habronattus oregonensis and Centruroides limpidus have a
similar base composition to S. erythranum (negative
AT-skew and positive GC-skew). After removing these
three taxa, S. erythranum clustered with Speleonectes
tulumensis (Crustacea: Remipedia), but the bootstrap
value and posterior probability are relatively low, which
prevent us from determining the exact phylogenetic
position of the Protura (Figure 7B). We also tested the
phylogenetic placement of S. erythranum by sequential
taxon removal, and it consistently showed a distant affinity to the Insecta (data not shown).
In our trees (Figure 7), the clade of Diplura and Collembola is sister to Insecta, although the bootstrap value
is relatively low. It is different from previous studies
based on mitochondrial gene sequences of diplurans
and collembolans, which suggested that some crustaceans are more closely related to Insecta than Collembola and Diplura [17]. More arthropod taxa are needed
to further discuss this problem.
The unusual long-branch length indicates that the S.
erythranum mitochondrial genomes are evolving rapidly.
The population of soil-dwelling proturans is usually very
small. Mutations may accumulate faster in such organisms due to the slow rate of gene flow. This also seems

true for nematodes, parasitic lice and mites, in which
high levels of genome diversity are commonly detected.
The study on the mitochondrial genome of two diplurans also reveals that high genetic divergence existed in
the morphologically uniform taxa [26].
Whether the Protura is a real hexapod group or not
has been debated for a long time [7]. The Protura have
many unique morphological characters compared with
other hexapods: 1) they have no eyes and no antennae;
2) they have abdominal legs on abdominal segments 13; 3) they have no caudal cerci but have a telson tail,
which is common in crustaceans but absent in other
hexapods [1-3]; 4) the axoneme of flagellated spermatozoa lacks central microtubules, which is similar to the
condition in pycnogonid spermatozoa [4]; 5) the serosa
(embryonic membrane) of proturans retains the ability
to differentiate into a tergum or definitive dorsal closure
during embryonic development, which is similar to crustaceans and myriapods, but different from other hexapods. Based on information from embryonic
development, Machida (2006) proposed that the Protura
may have a much longer evolutionary history than previously thought [9]. However, a few recent studies based
on EST data and rRNA genes have presented relatively
robust evidence supporting the monophyly of Hexapoda
and Pancrustacea (although only one proturan species
was included in these studies) [12,18].
Although the mitochondrial genome sequence of S.
erythranum is unique, with little phylogenetic affinity to
the insects, we cannot equate this to the evolutionary
history of the Protura. Mitochondrial genome data alone
are not enough to unambiguously resolve the

relationships of Protura, Diplura, Collembola and
Insecta. It is necessary to understand the limits and
applicability of these data [27]. Our sequence data
showed many unique molecular features, which can provide valuable information for studying problems of
mitochondrial genome evolution, for example, the
mechanisms of mitochondrial gene rearrangements,
truncation of tRNA secondary structures, and nucleotide
frequency bias. Understanding these fundamental biology problems should be helpful in phylogenetic analyses
when using mitochondrial genomic data.

Conclusions
This is the first report of a complete mitochondrial genome from the Protura. With highly divergent evolution,
their mtDNA has many different features to that of
other hexapods, including nucleotide-frequency bias,
gene order, and tRNA secondary structure. Therefore, it
is a valuable example to study the mechanism of mitochondrial gene evolution and rearrangement in the
Arthropoda.
Our study suggests that proturan mtDNAs do not
agree with the “cox1-trnL2-cox2“ pattern, which was
thought to be an important character shared by hexapod
and crustacean groups. It may be a result of secondary
reversion due to extensive rapid and divergent evolution,
but also may suggests that the Protura have a long evolutionary history, and do not have a close affinity to
hexapods and crustaceans. S. erythranum did not group
with other hexapods in our phylogenetic trees, and its
extreme long-branch implies that its mtDNA underwent
highly divergent evolution. More evidence is needed to

Chen et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:246
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/246

verify this hypothesis and to solve the conflict between
the studies on mitochondrial and nuclear gene markers.

Methods
mtDNA sequencing of S. erythranum

Specimens of S. erythranum were collected from Tianping Mountain (Jiangsu Province, China). The total DNA
of one individual was extracted with the commercial kit
Wizard SV Genomic Purification System (Promega), and
then was used as the template for PCR amplifications.
Initially, two small fragments of cox1 and cob were
amplified using two universal primer pairs of LCO1490/
HCO2198 [57] and CobF424/CobR876 [58], respectively,
and the PCR products were sequenced directly by the
amplification primers. Four primers were designed
according to these obtained sequences for two long PCR
amplifications encompassing the cox1/cob (~9 kb) and
cob/cox1 (~6 kb) fragments, respectively. These primers
were SI-C1-J320 (CTGGTTGAACTGTTTATCCTC
CTC)/SI-Cb-N239 (ATAAGGATGAAAACTAACCCTATCA), and SI-Cb-J181 (GTTCTTCTAATCCTTTAGGAGTTGG)/SI-C1-N343 (GAGGAGGATAAACAGTTCAACCAG). Long PCRs were generated with
LA Taq (Takara, Dalian, China) under the following
two-step conditions: 35 cycles of 96°C for 2 min and 68°
C for 10 min, followed by incubation at 68°C for 10
min. The 9 kb and 6 kb products were mixed together
after gel-purification, and then sequenced with the shotgun sequencing approach as described by Masta and
Boore (2004) [39]. The sequencing service was from
Shanghai Majorbio Biotech Co., Ltd. Two contigs were
assembled by Phred/Phrap [59,60] from the shotgun
sequencing readings, guaranteed to have 10 times coverage for both contigs. More specific primers were
designed for PCR amplifications to bridge two remaining gaps (primers available on request). All PCR products were then cloned and then sequenced by an ABI
3730 automated DNA sequencer. A consensus sequence
was assembled from all the contigs using Seqman in the
DNAStar software package (DNASTAR Inc., Madison,
WI) [61].
Gene annotation and secondary structure prediction

The sequence was submitted in Fasta format to the
web-based software DOGMA (Dual Organellar Genome
Annotator) [62] for primary annotation. BLAST searches
were done on NCBI Blast Entrez databases to ensure the
identity of PCGs and rRNA genes. To identify the tRNA
genes in the genome, we used the annotation obtained
by DOGMA (with the COVE threshold for tRNAs set to
7(low)), and further used tRNAscan-SE via the web
interface and the “Nematode Mito” settings for the
COVE program [63]. The ARWEN (version 1.2) program was also used by the web interface with the

Page 10 of 12

“mtmam” option switched off [64]. Finally, the tRNAs
were determined by comparing the secondary structures
suggested by these different programs. Tandemly repetitive sequences in the A+T-rich region were determined
both manually and by using the Tandem Repeats Finder
[65]. The putative minimum-free-energy structures of
TRRs were given by RNAfold WebServer in the Vienna
RNA Websuite [66].
Sequence determination of cox1/cox2 junction region

In order to find if trnL2 lay outside of cox1 and cox2,
not only in the Sinentomata but also in the other proturan groups, we amplified and sequenced the cox1/cox2
junction (about 1.4 kb) of B. tianmushanensis (Acerentomata: Berberentomidae), E. nivocolum (Eosentomata:
Eosentomidae) and Z. piligeroum (Eosentomata: Eosentomidae) using the universal primer pair C1-HCO-J and
C2-B-3665 [30]. We followed the above-mentioned
methods to annotate these genes.
Statistical comparison of strand asymmetry and of trnL2
positions of arthropod mtDNAs

We retrieved the nucleotide sequences and DNA compositions for all 359 published arthropod mtDNAs
(before January 16, 2011) from the Mitome database
[67] or NCBI Organelle Genome Resources. Strand
asymmetry represents strand compositional bias, usually
reflected by the AT skew = (A-T)/(A+T) and GC-skew
= (G-C)/(G+C) [32,68].
We further checked the position of trnL2 in all 359
available arthropod mtDNAs. For the pancrustacean
groups, we checked whether each mtDNA agreed with
the typical patterns of cox1-trnL2-cox2 and rrnL-trnL1nad1; then, we did the same for the other arthropods,
the myriapods and chelicerates, which typically have the
different pattern of cox1-cox2 and rrnL-trnL1-trnL2nad1 [16].
Phylogenetic Analysis

First, we choose 24 Panarthropoda representatives
(Additional File 3) for phylogenetic tree construction
based on previous studies [14,17], including three
groups with the similar base composition to S. erythranum (negative AT-skew and positive GC-skew, Additional File 4), in order to see if S. erythranum will group
with them because of LBA. Then, we reconstructed the
phylogenetic trees after removing these three taxa,
focusing on the relationship of S. erythranum and other
hexapods. The onychophoran Opisthopatus cinctipes
was defined as the outgroup in our analyses.
The nucleotide sequences of each PCG were retroaligned using DAMBE, version 5.1.1 [69]. The 13 amino
acid data were concatenated as an alignment of 3819
positions after individually aligned, and then, 2520

Chen et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:246

aligned characters for 24 taxa and 2616 aligned characters for 21 taxa were retained respectively after Gblocks
screening with default settings [70]. The best model
“mtREV24+G+I+F” was selected using MEGA 5.0 [71].
We carried out ML searches with RAxML through the
web portal http://phylobench.vital-it.ch/raxml-bb/index.
php[72]. Bayesian analysis was performed using MrBayes
(version 3.1.2), with mtRev+I+G model [73]. Four Markov chains were run for 1,000,000 generations, and
sampled every 100 generations to yield a posterior probability distribution of 10,000 trees. The first 2,000 trees
were discarded as burn-in. The standard deviation of
split frequencies was lower than 0.01 in 21 taxa dataset
analysis, but we failed to obtain a meaningful convergence for the 24 taxa dataset.
