Natural diversity of potato (Solanum
tuberosum) invertases
Astrid M Draffehn, Sebastian Meller, Li Li, Christiane Gebhardt*

Abstract
Background: Invertases are ubiquitous enzymes that irreversibly cleave sucrose into fructose and glucose. Plant
invertases play important roles in carbohydrate metabolism, plant development, and biotic and abiotic stress
responses. In potato (Solanum tuberosum), invertases are involved in ‘cold-induced sweetening’ of tubers, an
adaptive response to cold stress, which negatively affects the quality of potato chips and French fries. Linkage and
association studies have identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) for tuber sugar content and chip quality that
colocalize with three independent potato invertase loci, which together encode five invertase genes. The role of
natural allelic variation of these genes in controlling the variation of tuber sugar content in different genotypes is
unknown.
Results: For functional studies on natural variants of five potato invertase genes we cloned and sequenced 193
full-length cDNAs from six heterozygous individuals (three tetraploid and three diploid). Eleven, thirteen, ten,
twelve and nine different cDNA alleles were obtained for the genes Pain-1, InvGE, InvGF, InvCD141 and InvCD111,
respectively. Allelic cDNA sequences differed from each other by 4 to 9%, and most were genotype specific.
Additional variation was identified by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis in an association-mapping
population of 219 tetraploid individuals. Haplotype modeling revealed two to three major haplotypes besides a
larger number of minor frequency haplotypes. cDNA alleles associated with chip quality, tuber starch content and
starch yield were identified.
Conclusions: Very high natural allelic variation was uncovered in a set of five potato invertase genes. This
variability is a consequence of the cultivated potato’s reproductive biology. Some of the structural variation found
might underlie functional variation that influences important agronomic traits such as tuber sugar content. The
associations found between specific invertase alleles and chip quality, tuber starch content and starch yield will
facilitate the selection of superior potato genotypes in breeding programs.

Background
Invertases are ubiquitous enzymes that irreversibly
cleave sucrose into the reducing sugars fructose and glucose. Plant invertases not only play an important role in
the partitioning of carbon between source tissue (photosynthetic leaves) and heterotrophic sink tissues such as
seeds, tubers and fruits, they also function in plant
development and in responses to biotic and abiotic
stress. Three types of invertase isoenzymes, which are
encoded by small gene families, are regularly found in
plants. Cell wall-bound acidic invertases cleave sucrose
in the apoplastic space (apoplastic invertases). Soluble

acid invertases are located in the vacuole (vacuolar
invertases), whereas soluble neutral invertases are
located in the cytoplasm [1,2].
In the potato (Solanum tuberosum), carbon is stored
as starch polymers in tubers. Besides starch, tubers also
contain small amounts of sucrose, glucose and fructose.
The amounts of starch and sugars present in tubers
depend on the genotype and on environmental factors.
Storage at low temperature (e.g. 4°C) for several weeks
leads to conversion of a small fraction of starch into
sugars in tubers, with consequent accumulation of glucose and fructose, in particular [3,4]. This phenomenon
of ‘cold-induced sweetening’ is an adaptive response to
cold stress, as sugars have long been known to have an
osmoprotective function in plants [5]. Invertases,

together with other proteins, play a role in determining
the tuber sugar content before and during cold storage.
Invertase activity is present in tubers and increases during cold storage [6-8]. Transcripts of vacuolar invertase
accumulate in the tubers upon cold storage [9-11] and
invertase antisense inhibition changes the hexose to
sucrose ratio in the tubers [10]. The content of the
reducing sugars glucose and fructose in tubers is an
important criterion of quality for the potato processing
industry. During deep frying at high temperatures, reducing sugars and amino acids undergo a non-enzymatic
Maillard reaction, which results in a dark brown color
and inferior taste of potato chips or French fries due to
polyphenol formation [12,13]. With increasing tuber
sugar content, the chip color changes from light yellow
to brown or even black. Although the enzymatic and
biochemical steps in the interconversion between starch
and sugars are well known in plants in general and
potato in particular, the triggering and the regulation of
cold-induced sweetening in potato is not fully understood [3,4,14]. In addition, the impact of natural variation in potato genes involved in carbohydrate
metabolism on the quantitative variation of tuber starch
and sugar content among different genotypes is completely unknown.
Genetic mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for
tuber starch and sugar content on the one hand [15,16]
and localization of genes that function in carbohydrate
metabolism and transport on the other [17] have
pointed to a number of candidate genes, which roughly
colocalize with QTL for tuber starch and sugar content
[18]. Among these are three independent loci encoding
invertase genes. Potato cDNAs encoding apoplastic and
vacuolar invertases have been cloned and characterized
previously [10,11,19,20]. Using invertase cDNA
sequences as molecular markers, these three potato
invertase loci have been mapped [17]. The Pain-1 locus
on chromosome III encodes a vacuolar invertase,
whereas the loci Invap-a and Invap-b on chromosomes X
and IX, respectively, encode apoplastic invertases [17].
Two tandemly duplicated genes, InvGE and InvGF,
encoding apoplastic invertases have been identified in
one genomic fragment of 9 kb [21]. InvGE and InvGF
are orthologous to the closely related tomato invertase
genes LIN5 and LIN7, respectively, which are also tandemly duplicated and located on tomato chromosome 9
[22]. The Invap-b locus maps to the orthologous position
on potato chromosome IX. In view of the colinearity of
the genomes of potato and tomato [23], InvGE/InvGF
can both be assigned to the Inv ap -b locus. The locus
Invap-a on chromosome X was mapped with the same
cDNA probe ‘pCD141’ [20] as Invap-b, and is orthologous to a tomato locus on chromosome 10 encoding the
tandemly duplicated invertase genes LIN6 and LIN8

[22]. Genomic sequences of the potato Inv ap -a and
Pain-1 loci have not been reported.
Association mapping in populations of tetraploid
potato varieties and breeding clones has revealed ‘singlestrand conformation polymorphisms’ (SSCPs) [24] in
invertase genes at all three loci, which were associated
with tuber starch content, and/or chip color [25,26].
Most significant were associations with SSCP markers
derived from the Pain-1 gene on chromosome III [25].
These marker-trait associations are either direct (i.e.
allelic variants of the invertase gene itself are causal for
the phenotypic variation) or indirect (genes that are
physically linked but unrelated to the invertase gene are
responsible for the QTL) in effect. In the latter case, the
association observed at an invertase locus is the result
of linkage disequilibrium between the invertase gene
and other, unknown genes in the same haplotype block
[27]. Unfortunately, neither QTL linkage mapping down
to single-gene resolution [28] nor high-resolution association mapping using thousands of individuals for complex traits such as tuber starch content and chip color is
practicable in the cultivated potato. An alternative
approach is the direct functional analysis of invertase
allelic variants to elucidate their roles in determining
variation in tuber starch and sugar content. This
requires the cloning and characterization of full-length
invertase cDNA alleles from representative potato genotypes, and the identification of cDNA alleles that correspond to the associated SSCP markers. Here we report
the results of such a study.

Methods
Plant material

Invertase alleles were cloned from the tetraploid cultivars Satina, Diana and Theresa, and from the diploid S.
tuberosum lines H82.337/49 (P18), H80.696/4 (P40) and
H81.839/1 (P54) [29]. The tetraploid genotypes were
selected from 34 varieties included as standards in the
association mapping population ‘ALL’ described in [25],
because they possess invertase markers that are associated with tuber starch content (TSC), starch yield
(TSY), and chip quality in autumn after harvest (CQA)
and after cold storage (CQS) (Table 1). The diploid genotypes were the parents of the mapping populations
used to map cold-sweetening QTL [16]. Plants were
grown in pots in the greenhouse (day temperature 2024°C; night temperature 18°C; additional light from 6
am to 9 pm) or in a Saran-house under natural light
and temperature conditions from May to September.
Leaves and flowers were harvested throughout the growing season. Tubers were harvested from mature plants
and stored at 4°C in the dark. Genomic DNAs from 219
members of the association mapping population ALL
were used for SNP genotyping. This population consists

has been phenotyped for tuber yield (TY, [dt/ha]), starch
content (TSC, [%]), starch yield (TSY, [dt/ha]), and chip
quality after harvest in autumn (CQA, score from 1 to

RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis

Total RNA was extracted from leaves and flowers using
the ToTally RNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Cambridgeshire, UK) following the supplier’s protocol. Total RNA
was extracted from tuber tissue powdered in liquid
nitrogen, using the Plant RNA Isolation Kit from Invitrogen (Karlsruhe, Germany) following the supplier’s
protocol. Tuber RNA was further purified by high-salt
precipitation to remove polysaccharides and by lithium
chloride precipitation to remove low-molecular-weight
RNA. The RNA solution was adjusted to 1 mL by adding RNase-free water, mixed with 250 μl isopropanol
and 250 μl high salt solution (1.2 M sodium citrate, 0.8
M NaCl) and incubated on ice for 2 h. RNA was recovered by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C.
The pellet was rinsed with 70% ethanol, and centrifuged
at 13000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. After removing the ethanol, the pellet was air-dried and dissolved in RNase-free
water at a minimum concentration of 200 ng total RNA
per μl. High-molecular-weight RNA was precipitated by
mixing with 0.5 volumes of 5 M LiCl and incubating on
ice overnight at 4°C. RNA was collected by centrifugation as above, rinsed with 70% ethanol, dried and dissolved in 20-50 μl RNase-free water depending on pellet
size. All RNA samples were further purified using the
DNA-free™ Kit (Ambion). RNA concentration and quality were analyzed by measuring the A 260 nm /A 280 nm
(1.8 - 2.0) and A 260 nm /A 230 nm (2 - 3) ratios using a
Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Peclab,

Erlangen, Germany). RNA integrity was tested on 1%
agarose gels loaded with 300-500 ng of total RNA. Total
RNA was stored at -80°C. First-strand cDNA was
synthesized according to the supplier’s protocol from
2.0 μg of total RNA, using 200 U of Superscript™ II
Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) per reaction and 500
ng of oligo(dT)16-18 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) as primers. First-strand cDNA was treated with RNase H
(Roche, Mannheim, Germany) for 20 min at 37°C. Firststrand cDNA (1 μl per reaction) was then used for allele
amplification and cloning.
Invertase cDNA allele amplification, cloning and
sequencing

Primers spanning the start and stop codons of the
invertase genes (Table 2) were designed based on the
sequences of GenBank accession numbers L29099,
X70368 (Pain-1), AJ133765 (InvGE and InvGF),
Z21486 (InvCD111) and Z22645 (InvCD141). Pain-1
alleles were amplified using as template first-strand
cDNA from tubers stored for 25 days at 4°C. InvGE
and InvGF alleles were amplified from first-strand
cDNA templates obtained from leaves and flowers.
InvCD111 and InvCD141 alleles were amplified from
leaf cDNA templates. Oligonucleotides were purchased
from Invitrogen (Karlsruhe, Germany), Sigma-Aldrich
Chemie (Taufkirchen, Germany) and Operon Biotechnologies (Köln, Germany). Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) (annealing temperatures 55-65°C, 30-50
cycles) were performed using the Fast Start High Fidelity PCR System (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) or
KOD Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany) according to the supplier’s protocols.
PCR products were purified with the High Pure PCR
Purification Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and
ligated into the pGEM®-T/T Easy vector (Promega,
Mannheim, Germany) following the supplier’s

protocols. Competent cells of E. coli strains DH5a and
DH10B (MAX Efficiency® DH5a™ and ElectroMAX™
DH10B™ competent cells from Invitrogen, Karlsruhe,
Germany) were transformed with recombinant plasmids [30]. Transformed strains were cultured according to standard methods [31]. Plasmid DNA was
isolated with Plasmid Isolation Mini or Midi Kits (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced by the DNA
Core Facility at the Max-Planck Institute for Plant
Breeding Research on Applied Biosystems (Weiterstadt,
Germany) ABI PRISM 377, 3100 and 3730 sequencers,
using BigDye terminator (v3.1) chemistry. Premixed
reagents were from Applied Biosystems. SNPs were
identified in multiple sequence alignments (http://multalin.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/multalin.html). Due to
the large number of cDNAs sequenced, most variants
were represented at least two times in independent
PCRs primed with first-strand cDNA from the same
genotype. cDNA alleles were then defined based on
the consensus sequences of all clones obtained from
an individual genotype. In some cases, the number of
full-length cDNA sequences per genotype was
low (Table 3). Eleven alleles (InvGE-Db, InvGE-Sb,
InvGF-Te, InvGF-Sb, InvCD141-Sa, InvCD141-Dd2,
InvCD141-Td2, InvCD111-Sb, InvCD111-Sc, InvCD111Ta, InvCD111-P54d; see Tables S3, S4, S5 and S6 in
additional files 1, 2, 3 and 4) were therefore defined
based on a single cDNA sequence.

Invertase genomic sequences

The BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) libraries BA
and BC, both constructed from high-molecular-weight
genomic DNA of the diploid, heterozygous genotype P6/
210 and arrayed on high density filters, were screened by
filter hybridization with labeled probes for cDNAs Pain-1
[10] and pCD141 [20] as described [32,33]. Positive BACs
were confirmed by gene-specific PCR using primers as
described above and Southern gel-blot hybridization.
Complete BACs were custom sequenced by Eurofins
MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany) using a 454 platform [34]. In addition, the genes Pain-1 and InvCD141
were custom sequenced (GATC Biotech, Konstanz, Germany) by primer walking on the BACs using the dideoxy
chain-termination method [35]. Sequencing of the Pain-1
gene by primer walking was performed on the BAC
selected for complete sequencing, whereas the gene
InvCD141 was sequenced using BAC BC37c23. BAC
sequences were annotated using the Apollo Genome
Annotation and Curation Tool, version 1.9.8 [36].
Phylogenetic tree construction

Phylogenetic trees were generated using the maximum
parsimony method based on a Clustal W amino acid
alignment [37] of all invertase sequences integrated in
the MEGA 4 software [38]. In all, 1000 bootstrapping
runs were performed to obtain an estimate of the reliability of each branchpoint.

SNP genotyping

Association test

Amplicons were generated from genomic DNAs of the
heterozygous individuals of the ALL population with
locus-specific primers (Table 2). The amplicons were
purified with ExoSAP-IT® (USB, Cleveland, USA) and
custom sequenced at the Core Facility for DNA Analysis
of the Max-Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research.
The dideoxy chain-termination sequencing method was
employed using an ABI PRISM Dye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit and an ABI PRISM 3730
automated DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany). SNPs were identified by sequence
alignment and visual examination of the sequence trace
files for overlapping base-calling peaks. In each tetraploid individual bi-allelic SNPs were assigned to one of
five allelic states (two homozygous and three heterozygous). The SNP allele dosage in heterozygous individuals
(1:3, 2:2 or 3:1) was estimated from the relative heights
of the overlapping base-calling peaks, both manually
and with the Data Acquisition and Analysis Software
DAx (Van Mierlo Software Consultancy, Eindhoven,
The Netherlands). Pyrosequencing [39] was carried out
on a PSQ 96 system (Biotage AB, Uppsala, Sweden)
using the PSQ 96 SNP Reagent Kit according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. For pyrosequencing of the
Pain1_SNP1544 alleles, the following primers were used
to generate an amplicon of 252 bp: Forward : 5’-GGACCATTTGGTGTCGTTGT-3’, reverse: 5’-(biotin)
TCTTCCTCCTTGAGCAAAGC-3’. The sequencing primer was 5’-CGTTGTAATTGCTGATCA-3’.

SNPs were tested for association with the phenotypic
values using the general linear model (GLM) procedure
in SPSS 15.0 (SPSS GmbH Software, Munich, Germany).
The model used was

Haplotyping

Within the SATlotyper (v.1.0.5) software [40] the SAT
solver MiniSat_v1.14_cygwin was used to model haplotypes from unphased SNP data scored in the ALL population. Individuals with missing data for one or more
SNPs in the set chosen for haplotyping and individuals
with suboptimal quality of the amplicon sequence were
excluded from haplotype analysis.

y* = origin + marker + error

where y* stands for the adjusted phenotypic means
[25]. Origin is a factor (fixed) with four classes to identify the origin of each genotype in the ALL population
from one of three breeding companies or from the standard varieties [25]. Marker is a factor (fixed) with five
levels, corresponding to the five SNP allele dosages: 0
for allele absent, 1, 2, 3 and 4 for allele present in simplex, duplex, triplex or quadruplex dosage. Population
structure has been evaluated and described in [25].

Results
Genomic structure of the invertase loci Pain-1 and Invap-a

Whereas the genomic organization of the tandemly
duplicated genes InvGE and InvGF at the Invap-b locus
on chromosome IX is already known [21], no genomic
sequences of the loci Pain-1 and Inv ap -a have been
reported. We therefore isolated, sequenced and annotated the BAC clones BC149o15 (HQ197978) and
BC163l15 (HQ197979), which were selected from BAC
libraries based on cross-hybridization with Pain-1 and
InvCD141 probes. In addition to 454 sequencing of
whole BACs, the genes Pain-1 and InvCD141 were also
sequenced by the dideoxy chain-termination method
and primer walking. BC149o15 contained one full-length
copy of the Pain-1 gene. The Pain-1 sequences obtained
from the same BAC by two different sequencing techniques (454 and Sanger sequencing) differed by a sixnucleotide insertion in intron 2. The Pain-1 gene consists of seven exons and six introns and is around 4 kbp
long (Figure 1). The BAC clone BC163l15 contained
two tandemly duplicated invertase genes, InvCD111 and

InvCD141, which corresponded to the cDNA clones
pCD111 and pCD141 [20]. The two genes, 5 and 4.5
kbp in size, are separated by 7.3 kbp and each consists
of six exons and five introns (Figure 1). Sanger sequencing of InvCD141 in a third BAC (BC37c23) revealed a
gap of around 1 kbp in the assembly of the 454
sequences in intron 2. Besides that, the two sequences
differed by five nucleotides. The full annotation of BACs
BC149o15 and BC163l15 is shown in Table S1 in additional file 5. The individual genomic sequences of Pain1, InvCD141 and InvCD111 are available as GenBank
accessions HQ110080, HQ110081 and HQ197977,
respectively.
Natural diversity of Pain-1 cDNA alleles

Fifty-four full-length cDNA clones were sequenced from
tubers of the tetraploid varieties Satina, Diana and
Theresa, and the diploid genotypes P18, P40 and P54
that had been stored in the cold. Sequence comparisons
identified eleven different cDNA alleles that translated
into six amino acid sequences (Table 3). Fifty-eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected

when the eleven cDNA alleles were aligned. The inclusion of three soluble acid invertase sequences recovered
from the NCBI database (accessions AAA50305 =
Stpain1_a from cv Russet Burbank [11], ACC93585 =
Stpain1_c from cv Kufri Chipsona and AAQ17074 =
Stpain1_b from an unknown genotype) in the alignment
uncovered sixteen additional SNPs. Sequencing of exons
1, 3 and 7 of Pain-1 in the 34 standard varieties
included in the association mapping population ALL
identified four further SNPs. The total of 78 SNPs
included one tri-allelic SNP and resulted in amino acid
changes at 35 positions, corresponding to 5.5% of the
deduced Pain-1 protein sequence (Table 3, Table S2 in
additional file 6, Figure S1 in additional file 7). Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleic acid sequences (not shown)
separated the cDNA alleles into four similarity groups a, b, c and d. The group d alleles from the diploid genotype P40 were most divergent from the others (see
Table S2 in additional file 6). In order to identify cDNA
alleles corresponding to the SSCP markers associated
with the tuber traits (Table 1), and to detect any novel
SNP-trait associations, we genotyped the ALL

population for 15 SNPs in exon 3 of Pain-1 by amplicon
sequencing, and for SNP1544 in exon 5 by pyrosequencing. These sixteen SNPs included diagnostic SNP
alleles for groups a, b, c and d and for some individual
alleles, i.e. one of the two alternative nucleotides was
specific for an allele group or an individual allele (Table
S2 in additional file 6). The SNP alleles C552, A718, A1544
and T 741 were diagnostic for allele group a, A 528 for
group b, C777 and G1068 for group c, and T591 and G637
for group d. Five SNPs present in exon 3 of the cDNA
alleles were not detected in the corresponding amplicon
sequences (SNPs 534, 723, 834, 852, 927). Conversely,
four additional SNPs absent in the cDNA alleles were
detected and scored in the amplicon sequences of the
ALL population (SNPs 639, 825, 888, 943). The best
correspondence between presence/absence of SNP
alleles and the associated SSCP markers in the ALL
population was found for the SNP alleles in group a
(Table 4). The SNP alleles C552 and A718 corresponded
most closely to the SSCP marker Pain1-8c, A 1544 to
Pain1-9a, and the alleles T741 and C1143 were correlated
with Pain1-5d. A1544 was also weakly correlated with
Pain1-5c. None of the SNPs corresponded to SSCP marker Pain1-5b. The 16 SNPs were also tested for association with the tuber traits TSC, TY, TSY, CQA and CQS.
SNP alleles C552, A718 and A1544 were positively associated with chip quality, tuber starch content and starch
yield (lighter chip color, higher tuber starch content and
starch yield, Table 5), as were the corresponding SSCP
markers Pain1-8c and Pain1-9a [25]. The weak association
of SSCP marker Pain1-5d with tuber starch content was
confirmed by the corresponding SNP allele T741 (Table 5).
The six genotypes used for cDNA cloning represent only a
fraction of the genetic diversity of invertases in S. tuberosum. To obtain more comprehensive information on the
number and frequency of Pain-1 haplotypes distributed in
populations of tetraploid, heterozygous cultivars used in
breeding programs, we selected eleven SNPs, which were
diagnostic for allele groups a (SNPs 552, 718 and 1544), b

(SNP 825), and the individual alleles Sa (SNP741), P18b
(SNP1050) and Stpain1-a (SNP639 from cv Russet Burbank). Haplotypes were modeled using SATlotyper [40], a
software that infers haplotypes from unphased SNP data
in heterozygous polyploids. Fifteen haplotype models with
frequencies higher than 1% were obtained based on eleven
SNPs scored in 189 individuals of the ALL population
(Table 6). The haplotypes A, B and C with frequencies
higher than 10% accounted for 60% of all chromosomes in
the population (4 × 189 = 756), whereas 35% were
accounted for by 12 haplotypes with frequencies between
1% and 10%. Among the latter were five haplotypes that
included the associated SNP alleles C552, A718, A1544 and
T741. Five haplotype models were verified by corresponding cDNA clones, whereas the remaining ten haplotypes
were novel (Table 6).
Natural diversity of InvGE and InvGF cDNA alleles at the
Invap-b locus

Fifty-nine InvGE and thirty-eight InvGF full-length cDNAs
were cloned from leaf and flower tissue of the three tetraploid and the three diploid genotypes (Table 3), and subsequently sequenced. In contrast to the reported flowerspecific expression of InvGF [21], we found that InvGF
was expressed also in leaves. The expression level in leaves
was genotype dependent (data not shown).
Comparative sequence analysis of the InvGE cDNAs
identified 13 different cDNA alleles encoding 12 amino
acid sequences (Table 3, Tables S3 and S4 in additional
files 1 and 2). Alignment of the InvGE cDNAs and
InvGE from accession AJ133765 (cv Saturna, StinvGE-c)
[21] identified 133 SNPs (two of them tri-allelic) and
two insertions/deletions (indels) of one codon each.
Sequencing of the amplicons of exons 1 and 6 in the 34
standard varieties uncovered two additional SNPs. The
135 SNPs plus the two indels resulted in 53 amino acid
changes, corresponding to 9.1% of the deduced InvGE
protein sequence (Figure S2 in additional file 8). Grouping of the cDNA sequences according to similarity
resulted in six groups (Table S3 in additional file 1).
Group a was the most divergent and group d the most
heterogeneous with many allele-specific SNPs. The Ta
allele apparently resulted from recombination with allele
Sd. It had been shown previously [26] that Histidine 368
(His368) corresponds to the associated markers InvGE6f and InvGF-4d, which are in high linkage disequilibrium with each other due to the close physical linkage
between InvGE and InvGF. The SNP allele A1103 coding
for His368 was specific for allele group a (Table S3 in
additional file 1). The cDNA alleles in InvGE group a
therefore corresponded to the marker InvGE-6f. Amplicon sequencing of exon 3 of gene InvGE proved difficult

due to the presence of the two indels. We therefore
amplified and sequenced exon 1 in the ALL population
and scored eleven SNPs, which were tested for association with the tuber traits. SNP allele G95, which is diagnostic for alleles Sa and Da, showed a weak association
with CQS, consistent with the association of InvGE-6f
[25]. One new association was found. The SNP allele
InvGE-A85 was positively associated (higher tuber starch
content and starch yield) with TSC and TSY (Table 5).
Haplotype analysis of 197 individuals using eight diagnostic SNPs in exon 1 identified 19 haplotypes found at
frequencies greater than 1% in the ALL population
(Table 7). Haplotypes A and B occurred at frequencies
higher than 10% and accounted for 39% of all chromosomes in the population (4 × 197 = 788). Fourteen haplotypes with frequencies between 1% and 10% accounted
for 60% of the chromosomes, including the associated
alleles Sa and Da. Six haplotype models were compatible with cDNA sequences, whereas the remaining eleven
haplotypes were new.
For InvGF, ten cDNA alleles were identified that
coded for eight different amino acid sequences (Table 3,
Table S4 in additional file 2, Figure S3 in additional file
9). Alignment of the cDNA alleles and InvGF from
accession AJ133765 (cv Saturna, StinvGF-b) [21]
revealed 99 SNPs, including three tri-allelic SNPs, which
caused amino acid changes at 26 positions, corresponding to 4.5% of the deduced InvGF protein. Five similarity
groups were distinguished. As in the case of InvGE,
group a was the most divergent and group d was the
most heterogeneous. The a and d alleles of InvGE and
InvGF might be part of the same haplotype block. The
InvGF group a alleles are therefore likely to correspond
to the marker InvGF-4d.

Natural diversity of InvCD141 and InvCD111 cDNA alleles
at the Invap-a locus

Invertase cDNA alleles at the Invap-a locus were cloned
from leaf tissue. Fewer clones were sequenced than in
the case of the loci Pain-1 and Inv ap -b. Twelve
InvCD141 cDNA alleles (11 amino acid sequences) were
represented among 28 sequences from six genotypes,
and 9 InvCD111 cDNA alleles (8 amino acid sequences)
were obtained from 14 sequences of five genotypes
(Table 3). Two additional alleles were found in the database: accessions Z21486 (cv Cara, StinvCD111-a) [19]
and Z22645 (cv Cara, StinvCD141-d) [20]. One hundred
and four SNPs (InvCD141) including three tri-allelic
SNPs, and 71 SNPs (InvCD111) caused 32 and 36
amino acid changes, respectively, equivalent to 5-6%
protein diversity (Table 3, Tables S5 and S6 in additional files 3 and 4, Figures S4 and S5 in additional files
10 and 11). Grouping of the cDNA alleles according to
similarity resulted in six and four groups for InvCD141
and InvCD111, respectively (Tables S5 and S6 in additional files 3 and 4). Sequencing of the amplified exon 3
of InvCD141 in the ALL population allowed us to score
38 SNPs. SNPs specific for the cDNA allele Sa (A280,
T 288, T 339, T 543, A 630, C 1030, G 1031, T 1096 ) were all in
high linkage disequilibrium with each other. The presence/absence of this Sa-specific haplotype (Table S5 in
additional file 3) in the ALL population corresponded
nearly perfectly to the associated SSCP marker pCD1413c (Jaccard similarity measure 0.92), indicating that the
cDNA allele Sa corresponds to pCD141-3c. Association
analysis of the SNPs confirmed Sa as an allele that is
negatively associated with chip quality and tuber starch
content. In addition, one novel, positive association of
InvCD141-G765 with CQS, TSC and TSY was detected

(Table 5). Haplotype modeling based on 192 individuals
and ten SNPs resulted in 18 InvCD141 haplotype models (Table 8) with frequencies above 1%. Two haplotypes
with frequencies higher than 10% accounted for 27% of
all chromosomes in the population (4 × 192 = 768),
whereas the remaining 16 haplotypes with frequencies
between 1% and 10% accounted for 74% of the chromosomes. Four haplotype models were compatible with
cDNA alleles, including the associated allele Sa (haplotype E), whereas the remaining 14 haplotypes were new.
Phylogenetic analysis of putative invertase proteins

A phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the amino
acid sequences deduced from 46 full-length cDNA
sequences of Pain-1, InvGE, InvGF, InvCD141 and
InvCD111 (S. tuberosum) and seven tomato invertase
genes from S. lycopersicum and S. pennellii (Figure 2).
The tree clearly showed five major branches corresponding to the five invertase genes from potato. With
the exception of SlLIN9 (CAJ19056), which formed a
sixth branch, the tomato genes Slpain1-a (AAB30874),
SpLIN5-a (CAB85898), SlLIN5-a (CAB85897), SlLIN7-a
(AAM22410), SlLIN6-a (BAA33150) and SlLIN8-a
(AAM28822) clustered with the respective orthologous
potato genes. The interspecific distances between potato
and tomato invertases were larger than the intraspecific
distances between potato invertase alleles. Pain-1 was

more closely related to the gene pair InvCD111/
InvCD141 than to InvGE/InvGF.

Discussion
Analysis of 193 cDNA sequences obtained from three
tetraploid and three diploid potato genotypes revealed a
high level of natural allelic variation in five potato invertase genes. Fifty-five different full-length cDNA
sequences were identified, none of which were previously represented in the databases. Most were genotype specific: only nine were isolated from more than
one of the cultivars examined. The average SNP density
in cultivated potato is one SNP per 21-24 bp [41,42].
The genes Pain-1 and InvCD111 fell within this range
with one SNP per 24 and 25 bp, respectively. The highest variability, with one SNP per 13 bp, was observed in
the InvGE gene. InvGF and InvCD141, both with one
SNP per 17 bp, also had higher than average variability.
A total of 479 SNPs were detected, and nine (1.6%)
were tri-allelic. The 55 identified sequence variants
represent a minimum estimate of the number of invertase alleles present in the six genotypes. Other alleles
may have been missed due to template bias during PCR
amplification [40] or because sample sizes were small,
e.g. InvCD141 and InvCD111 in some genotypes. The
sequence variants encode 46 distinct invertase proteins

that differ from each other by between 4 and 9%. We
took various precautions to eliminate sequence variants
resulting from mistakes in reverse transcription or PCR.
High-fidelity Taq polymerases were used to minimize
PCR-derived errors, and cDNAs were cloned from different PCR reactions. Three quarters of the cDNA
alleles were supported by at least two cDNA sequences,
and alleles were defined based on consensus sequences
of all cDNA clones derived from an individual genotype,
eliminating singletons (SNPs occurring only once in the
multiple sequence alignments). Although we cannot
prove that all of the 479 SNPs are authentic, it is highly
unlikely that more than a tiny minority of the SNPs
observed were generated in the test tube. The generally
high level of DNA polymorphism in the genome of
Solanum tuberosum is well documented [29,33,41,42].
However, very few data are available on the range of
natural allelic variation among specific potato genes,
particularly across multiple genotypes as studied here.
Usually, potato genes are cloned and functionally characterized in a single cultivar. However, five different
full-length cDNA clones encoding potato allene oxide
synthase 2 (StAOS2) have been cloned from three
diploid genotypes and functionally characterized [43].
High sequence variability has also been observed among
genuine cDNA clones encoding Kunitz-type inhibitors

in two tetraploid varieties [44]. The reason for this high
genetic plasticity of the cultivated potato can be found
in its reproductive biology. Potatoes are clonally propagated on an annual cycle. At much larger intervals (on
the order of decades), the vegetative cycle is interrupted
by sexual reproduction in the context of breeding programs. These combine heterozygous parental clones,
select recombinant seedlings and propagate them again
clonally. Switching between clonal and sexual reproduction may have been exploited during potato domestication and evolution, when farmers observed and selected
in the field spontaneous hybrid seedlings among their
clonally propagated crop [45]. In such a reproductive
system, somatic mutations occurring at random during
clonal propagation can give rise to cell lineages that
eventually enter the germ line. Clonal selection will
remove deleterious and favor beneficial somatic mutations [45]. The buffering capacity of a tetraploid genome
may also allow the propagation of recessive deleterious
mutations. The potato genome therefore represents a
rich natural reservoir of mutant genes. In this respect,
the potato genome stands in sharp contrast to the genome of its close relative the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). The two genomes are highly colinear, but tomato
shows very little intraspecific variation [46]. In contrast
to potato, tomato is self-compatible and is propagated

exclusively via seeds. Comparative functional characterization of natural potato invertase alleles - which is now
possible, promises to uncover some interesting structure-function relationships. Functional differences
between the coding regions of potato invertase alleles
may be uncovered by the complementation of a yeast

invertase mutant and the biochemical characterization
of the heterologous expressed proteins [28]. Differences
in the expression of alleles can be detected by quantifying the expression based on allele specific SNPs and
pyrosequencing technology (Draffehn et al., manuscript
in preparation).

The work reported here was designed to identify fulllength cDNA clones encoding invertase alleles that are
associated with chip quality, tuber starch content and
starch yield [25] for further functional analysis. This
goal was achieved for the associated markers Pain1-9a,
Pain1-8c, InvGE-6f/InvGF-4d and pCD141-3c, but not
for Pain1-5b and Pain1-5c, perhaps because an insufficient number of cDNA clones was analyzed. Alternatively, these SSCP markers might result from intron
polymorphism that is not detectable in cDNA
sequences. The full range of invertase alleles present in
a population of 219 tetraploid individuals can be captured by genotyping 15, 11 and 38 SNPs, respectively, at
the three invertase loci. Association analysis of the SNPs
identified two new associations, one between the SNP
allele InvGE-A 85 and TSC and TSY, and the other
between InvCD141-G765 and CQS, TSC and TSY (Table
5). The Pain1-a alleles showed the most significant and
positive effects on chip quality and tuber starch content.
The corresponding SSCP markers also show epistatic
interactions with other candidate loci, which increase
starch yield [47]. However, the frequency of these alleles
in the ALL population was less than 10%. Enrichment of
Pain1-a alleles in breeding populations should facilitate
the selection of cultivars with improved quality traits.
Interestingly, the three SNPs diagnostic for Pain-1
alleles of group a (C 552 , A 718 and A 1544 ) differed in
their associations. These SNPs are in strong but not
absolute linkage disequilibrium with each other. Pain1C552 and Pain1-A718 were more strongly associated with
chip quality after cold storage, whereas Pain1-A1544 was
mainly associated with tuber starch content. Whereas
the cDNA alleles Pain1-Da, Sa and P18a contained all
three SNPs, the allele StPain1-a (AAA50305) contained
only A1544. This and the four different haplotype models
obtained for these three SNPs (haplotypes K, M, N, O,
Table 6) suggest further structural and possibly functional differentiation between the associated Pain1-a
alleles, which may be exploitable for marker-assisted
selection. Pain1-snp552 causes a synonymous nucleotide
change, whereas Pain1-snp718 and Pain1-snp1544
induce non-synonymous changes. Pain1-SNP1544
causes the non-conservative amino acid change
Thr515Lys. Whether these differences between the coding sequences or differences in the corresponding promoter regions are causal for possibly functional
variation remains to be elucidated.
The direct inference of haplotypes from amplicon
sequences requires that loci be homozygous, which is
rarely the case in diploid and tetraploid potato genotypes. In amplicon sequences derived from heterozygous
loci, the phase of the SNPs is unknown. The SATlotyper
software was developed to model haplotypes in

Page 13 of 15

polyploid species based on unphased SNP data [40].
Haplotype modeling with a subset of the SNPs scored in
the invertase genes Pain-1, InvGE and InvCD141
resulted for each gene in two or three haplotypes with
higher frequencies (above 10%) and a large number of
minor haplotypes with low frequencies. This haplotype
distribution might be typical for nuclear genes of the
European potato and a signature of its domestication,
introduction and breeding history [48-50]. More genes
must be analyzed however, before any general conclusions can be drawn. The occurrence of numerous lowfrequency haplotypes is compatible with introgressions
from other tuber-bearing Solanum species during 20thcentury breeding programs [50] and/or sequence diversification due to fixation of somatic mutations as outlined above. The SNP information will be useful for
tracing specific haplotypes back to their origin.
Haplotype modeling correctly predicted some, but not
all cDNA alleles that were obtained experimentally from
the cvs Satina, Diana and Theresa and could have been
detected based on the chosen SNP set. This is because,
based on the analysis of sequence trace files, the SNP
allele dosage cannot be scored with complete accuracy
in all individuals used for haplotype modeling. A small
percentage of scoring errors leads to haplotype artefacts
with low frequency. To eliminate such artefacts, we considered only haplotype models with a frequency above
1%. As this is an arbitrary threshold, we cannot exclude
the possibility that some of the remaining low-frequency
haplotypes are also artefacts. Nevertheless, our results
demonstrate that SATlotyper is a valuable tool for the
fast identification of the major haplotypes present in
populations of tetraploid potatoes. The determination of
the exact haplotype composition of a tetraploid individual, including rare haplotypes, calls for an allele cloning approach such as that performed in this study.
As in tomato [22], the four genes encoding cell wallbound acidic invertases in potato are organized in two
pairs of tandemly duplicated genes on chromosomes IX
and X. The soluble acid invertase is encoded by a single
gene on potato chromosome III. The existence of a
sixth potato invertase gene is predicted, which is orthologous to the tomato gene SlLIN9 located on chromosome 8 (based on the draft genome sequence of tomato
provided by “The International Tomato Genome
Sequencing Consortium” available at http://solgenomics.
net and on personal communication from Gisella
Orjeda, Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia, Peru).
This gene might encode a soluble neutral invertase not
characterized so far in potato. The five characterized
potato invertase genes are all located within segmental
chromosome duplications of unknown size, which show
structural conservation with other, distantly related

Draffehn et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:271

plant species [51,52]. Functionally essential parts of an
ancestral plant genome might be preserved in such conserved chromosome segments. The important role
invertases play in many aspects of plant life is consistent
with their location in evolutionarily ancient parts of
plant genomes.

Conclusions
Very high natural allelic variation in five potato invertase genes was uncovered by sequence analysis of full
length cDNA clones from six different genotypes and
SNP analysis in a larger association mapping population.
This variability is explained by the potato’s reproductive
biology. Some of the structural variation found might be
causal for functional variation, which influences important agronomic traits of the potato such as tuber starch
and sugar content. The invertase cDNA clones
described here are the basis for further functional studies. The associations found between specific invertase
alleles and tuber starch content, starch yield and chip
quality facilitate the selection of superior potato genotypes in breeding programs. Finally, our results point
out that natural variation should be taken into account
when conducting molecular and functional characterization of potato genes.
