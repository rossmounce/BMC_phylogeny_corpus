Abstract
Background: Ectomycorrhizae (ECM) are symbioses formed by polyphyletic assemblages of fungi
(mostly Agaricomycetes) and plants (mostly Pinaceae and angiosperms in the rosid clade). Efforts
to reconstruct the evolution of the ECM habit in Agaricomycetes have yielded vastly different
results, ranging from scenarios with many relatively recent origins of the symbiosis and no reversals
to the free-living condition; a single ancient origin of ECM and many subsequent transitions to the
free-living condition; or multiple gains and losses of the association. To test the plausibility of these
scenarios, we performed Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analyses including fungi, plants, and
other eukaryotes, based on the principle that a symbiosis cannot evolve prior to the origin of both
partners. As we were primarily interested in the relative ages of the plants and fungi, we did not
attempt to calibrate the molecular clock using the very limited fossil record of Agaricomycetes.
Results: Topologically constrained and unconstrained analyses suggest that the root node of the
Agaricomycetes is much older than either the rosids or Pinaceae. The Agaricomycetidae, a large
clade containing the Agaricales and Boletales (collectively representing 70% of Agaricomycetes), is
also significantly older than the rosids. The relative age of Agaricomycetidae and Pinaceae,
however, is sensitive to tree topology, and the inclusion or exclusion of the gnetophyte Welwitschia
mirabilis.
Conclusion: The ancestor of the Agaricomycetes could not have been an ECM species because it
existed long before any of its potential hosts. Within more derived clades of Agaricomycetes, there
have been at least eight independent origins of ECM associations involving angiosperms, and at least
six to eight origins of associations with gymnosperms. The first ECM symbioses may have involved
Pinaceae, which are older than rosids, but several major clades of Agaricomycetes, such as the
Boletales and Russulales, are young enough to have been plesiomorphically associated with either
rosids or Pinaceae, suggesting that some contemporary ECM partnerships could be of very ancient
origin.

Background

The Agaricomycotina comprises three major clades, the
Agaricomycetes, Tremellomycetes, and Dacrymycetes
(Figure 1). The Agaricomycetes is by far the largest, with
20,951 described species (98% of Agaricomycotina) [6],
including diverse ECM-forming species and saprotrophs,
as well as lesser numbers of plant pathogens, mycoparasites, insect symbionts, and lichens. The Tremellomycetes
and Dacrymycetes (yeasts and jelly fungi) contain mycoparasites, animal pathogens, and wood-decayers and they
form a paraphyletic grade at the base of the Agaricomycotina, suggesting that the plesiomorphic condition of the
Agaricomycotina is non-ECM [7-10].
The Agaricomycetes can be further divided into 14 independent clades, eight of which contain ECM species
(Agaricales, Boletales, Russulales, Thelephorales, Hymenochaetales, Phallomycetidae, Cantharellales (including
'Tulasnellales'), and Sebacinales). Except for the Thelephorales, all of the ECM-containing clades of Agaricomycetes also contain saprotrophic species (Figure 1). The
pattern of transformations between ECM and saprotrophic lifestyles in the Agaricomycetes is controversial.
Hibbett et al [3] reconstructed the evolution of the ECM
habit using phylogenetic trees containing 161 species
from across the Agaricomycetes. ASR using equally
weighted parsimony and maximum likelihood (ML)
methods suggested that the ancestor of the Agaricomycetes was saprotrophic, and that there have been 7 to 13
independent gains of the ECM habit and three to nine
losses (reversals to the saprotrophic condition) across the
Agaricomycetes. The inferred reversals to the free-living
condition were surprising, in part because they suggested
that mutualisms are not stable endpoints in evolution.
The largest concentration of 'secondarily derived' saprotrophs inferred by Hibbett et al [3] was in the Agaricomyc-

Ectomycorrhizae (ECM) are symbiotic associations that
involve fungi and many of the dominant trees of both
temperate and tropical forests. Reconstructing the origins
of ECM associations is important to understand the evolution of terrestrial ecosystems, but this task is made difficult by extensive homoplasy in the evolution of these
symbioses in both fungi and plants. This study focuses on
the evolution of the ECM habit in the Agaricomycotina
(Basidiomycota), which contains the vast majority of
ECM-forming fungi. Most studies on this subject have
used phylogenetic approaches coupled with ancestral
state reconstruction (ASR) [1-5]. Here, we use molecular
clock analyses to estimate the relative ages of major clades
of Agaricomycotina and their potential plant hosts. We
focus on key nodes in the fungal phylogeny that subtend
clades containing ECM and saprotrophic taxa, and ask
whether it is plausible that the ancestors at these nodes
could have been partners in ancient ECM associations.

etidae, a large clade containing the Agaricales (13,233
described species) and Boletales (1316 species), which
collectively represent about 70% of Agaricomycetes. The
analysis of Hibbett et al [3] suggested that the most recent
common ancestor of the Agaricomycetidae was an ECMforming species, implying that all of the saprotrophic species of Agaricomycetidae were ultimately derived from
symbiotic taxa.
Several recent analyses have cast doubt on the occurrence of
reversals from ECM to saprotrophic lifestyles. Bruns and
Shefferson [2] repeated the parsimony based ASR of Hibbett et al [3], using the same trees, but with a two-to-one
weighting of losses vs. gains. Under this weighting regime,
all but one reversal disappeared, and that reversal (involving Lentaria byssoides in the Phallomycetidae) could be an
artifact due to limited taxon sampling or erroneous character scoring. Analyses focused within the Agaricales and

Boletales have also suggested that there have been multiple
origins of the ECM habit and no losses [1,5]. Yet another
scenario for the evolution of ECM in Agaricomycotina was
proposed by Weiss and colleagues [7,11], who suggested
that the ancestor of all the Agaricomycetes might have been
an ECM species, with many later reversals to the free-living
condition. This conclusion was based on the discovery that
the Sebacinales, which appears to be the sister group of all
other Agaricomycetes, includes many ECM-forming species. In short, tree-based reconstructions of ancestral states
have yielded vastly different interpretations of the evolution of ECM in Agaricomycetes, ranging from scenarios
with many relatively recent gains and no losses [1,2,5], a
single ancient gain and many subsequent reversals [11], or
multiple gains and losses [3].
As an alternative to ASR, molecular clock analyses can be
used to identify branches in the phylogeny in which the
evolution of ECM could have been possible, based on the
principle that a symbiosis cannot arise prior to the origin
of both partners. Molecular clock analyses are complicated by heterogeneity in rates of molecular evolution and
the need for calibration. The oldest unambiguous Agaricomycete fossils are Quatsinoporites cranhamii ca. 130 to
125 Ma [12], which is probably in the Hymenochaetales
or Polyporales, and Archaeomarasmius leggeti ca. 90 to 94
Ma [13], which is most likely in the Agaricales, possibly in
the 'Marasmioid clade' [5]. The oldest fossils of ECM roots
are from the Middle Eocene, ca. 50 Ma [14]. The paucity
of Agaricomycete fossils, and uncertainty about their taxonomic placements, severely limit their utility for calibration purposes. The sensitivity of fungal molecular clock
analyses to the taxonomic assignments of fossils was demonstrated by Taylor and Berbee [15], who used the 400
million-year-old ascomycete Paleopyrenomycites devonicus
to calibrate a phylogeny of the fungi. Paleopyrenomycites
devonicus has been classified in the Sordariomycetes, but
Taylor and Berbee argued that it could also be a member
of the Dothideomycetes, Chaetothyriomycetes, or Taphrinomycotina (all are Ascomycota). Depending on the
placement of P. devonicus, the common ancestor of
Dikarya (the clade containing Basidiomycota and Ascomycota) was estimated to be anywhere from 452 to 1489
million years old [15]. Three other molecular clock studies that analyzed datasets with 37 to 129 genes have estimated the Dikarya to be 727 to 1208 million years old
[16-18]. The age of plants based on molecular clock analyses is similarly ambiguous, having been estimated to be
from 425 to 703 million years old [19,20]. These discrepancies indicate that it is hazardous to compare absolute
age estimates for clades taken from different studies.
The goal of our study was to place bounds on reasonable
reconstructions of the evolution of the ECM habit in the
Agaricomycetes by estimating the relative ages of selected

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/7/13

fungal clades and their potential ECM hosts. We performed Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analyses [21,22]
of a dataset containing genes encoding two subunits of
RNA polymerase II (RPB1 and RPB2) and nuclear large
and small subunit ribosomal RNA from 69 species,
including fungi, plants, and other eukaryotes (Additional
file 1), and we assessed which nodes in the fungal phylogeny are young enough to have been involved in ECM associations. As we were interested only in the relative ages of
the plant and fungal taxa, we did not attempt to calibrate
the molecular clock using the limited fungal fossil record.

Results
An unconstrained relaxed molecular clock analysis
returned a topology that is largely consistent with prior
multilocus phylogenies of fungi and other eukaryotes,
with several exceptions: 1) the Polyporales is placed as the
sister group of the Russulales; 2) the opisthokonts are paraphyletic, with Dictyostelium as the sister group of the rhodophyte-viridiplantae clade; 3)Amborella and Nymphaea
form a clade that is the sister group to the remaining
angiosperms; and, 4) gnetophytes are placed as the sister
group of the rest of the seed plants (Figure 2). The latter
feature contradicts several multilocus studies which suggest that the gnetophytes are the sister group of the
Pinaceae, the so-called gnepine hypothesis [23-25]. To
assess the impact of the topology on relative age estimates,
we performed a pair of constrained analyses, which reflect
a consensus phylogeny based on multilocus analyses of
fungi [4,10,26], plants [23-25,27-29], and other eukaryotes [30,31]. The two constrained analyses differed only in
the inclusion or exclusion of the gnetophyte Welwitschia
mirabilis (Figures 3 and 4).
We evaluated the relative ages of plant and fungal clades
on all three trees, considering clades with non-overlapping 95% highest posterior density ranges (HPDs) of
node heights to be significantly different in age. Within
the fungi, we focused on the root nodes (most recent common ancestors) of the Agaricomycetes, Agaricomycetidae,
Agaricales, Boletales, and Russulales, while in the plants
we focused on the root node of the rosids and the stem
node of the Pinaceae.
In all three analyses, the rosids were resolved as being significantly younger than the Agaricomycetes and Agaricales, overlapping in age with the Russulales, and
marginally younger than the Boletales (that is, 95% HPDs
of node heights are barely overlapping) (Figure 5; Table
1). All three analyses also suggest that the Pinaceae is significantly younger than the most recent common ancestor
of the Agaricomycetidae and Polyporales, and older than,
or overlapping in age with, the Boletales and Russulales
(Figure 5; Table 1). In contrast, the relative age of the
Pinaceae and Agaricomycetidae and Agaricales was sensi-

other hand, the constrained analysis excluding Welwitschia implies that the gnepine clade (Pinaceae + gnetophytes) is younger than the angiosperms, which is
surprising, considering that the oldest angiosperm fossils

are Cretaceous in age, while the gnetophytes have a fossil
record that extends to the Permian [32,33]. Given these
conflicting lines of evidence, we consider the node heights
for Pinaceae from the analyses including or excluding
Welwitschia to be equally plausible.

Discussion
This is not the first molecular clock study to include both
plants and fungi, but it is the first such study with sufficiently detailed taxon sampling to directly compare the
relative ages of the nodes that are critical for reconstructing the evolution of ECM associations among the Agaricomycetes. The relaxed molecular clock method that we

used is intended to compensate for heterogeneity in rates
of molecular evolution, but this nonetheless remains a
potential source of error, as illustrated by the impact of
Welwitschia on node heights in gymnosperms. It remains
to be determined (perhaps through simulation analyses)
whether the degree of rate heterogeneity in our dataset is
likely to cause artifacts in BEAST analyses. This approach

requires an implicit ASR of the ECM habit in angiosperms
and gymnosperms, which is discussed below.
Approximately 33 families of angiosperms have ECMforming species [34]. Many of the most diverse and ecologically dominant groups of ECM-forming angiosperms
are within the rosids, such as Fagales, Salicaceae, Dipterocarpaceae, and Myrtaceae, but there are also ECM taxa
scattered across the monocots, basal eudicots, and asterids
(Table 2) [34]. It is most parsimonious to infer that the
ECM habit has arisen repeatedly across these groups of
angiosperms, possibly involving repeated transitions
from arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) associations [34].
Molecular clock analyses of angiosperms by Wikström et
al [35] suggest that the rosids is older than any of the
clades of ECM-forming angiosperms outside of the rosids
(Table 2). The symbiotic status of the ancestor of the rosids is not clear, however. There are many AM taxa in the
rosids [34], suggesting either that there have been multiple origins of ECM in rosids or multiple reversals to AM
associations. Wikström et al [35] estimated that the
Fagales are about 60 to 61 million years old, while the
entire rosid clade is about 100 to 109 million years old.
Thus, the root node of the rosids provides a reasonable
maximum age for the origin of the ECM habit in
angiosperms, and it probably does not dramatically overestimate the age of origin of ECM in angiosperms.

Within the gymnosperms, the overwhelming majority of
ECM taxa are found in the Pinaceae, which are all (so far
as is known) capable of entering into the symbiosis [34].
Several species of Juniperus (Cupressaceae) and one species of Wollemia (Araucariaceae) have also been reported
to form ECM [36-38], but these reports are controversial
[39]. Among the gnetophytes, only Gnetum has been
shown to be ECM forming [34,40]. Based on published
gymnosperm phylogenies [23,24], it is most parsimonious to infer that the ability to form ECM is a synapomorphy of the Pinaceae, whereas it is a derived condition
within the Gnetales, Cupressaceae, and Araucariaceae (if it
actually occurs in the latter taxa). Therefore, the maximum and minimum ages for the origin of ECM in gymnosperms are set by the split between the lineages leading to
gnetophytes and the Pinaceae, which must have occurred
by the Permian, about 270 Ma, and the diversification of
Pinaceae, which began by the early Cretaceous, ca. 130 Ma
[34,41].
To estimate the minimum number of origins of ECM symbioses in Agaricomycetes, we mapped the node heights of
the rosids and Pinaceae onto the phylogeny of the Agaricomycetes [4,10,26]. All of our analyses indicate that the
Agaricomycetes is too old to have been plesiomorphically
mycorrhizal (Figures 1 and 3; Table 1). Our results also
suggest that ECM symbioses involving rosids must have

age. The other two analyses, however, suggest that there
must have been at least eight origins of ECM associations
with gymnosperms, just as with angiosperms (Figure 1).

Agaricomycotina

Our findings are consistent with prior studies that have
inferred multiple origins of ECM, with no reversals [1,2,5]
and they clearly reject the view that the common ancestor
of all Agaricomycetes was mycorrhizal, with saprotrophy
being a generally derived condition [11]. Evaluation of
the multiple-gains-and-losses hypothesis [3] is not so
straightforward, however, in large part because we are
unable to reject the hypothesis that the ancestor of the
Agaricomycetidae was mycorrhizal. Resolution of this
problem would be aided by improved estimates of node
heights in gymnosperms, which are obscured by evolutionary rate heterogeneity, particularly involving gnetophytes.

evolved independently in each of the eight major clades of
Agaricomycetes that contain ECM-forming species (Figure
1). The minimum number of origins of ECM associations
involving Pinaceae is more ambiguous. The constrained
analysis that retained Welwitschia suggests there must have
been at least six origins of ECM involving gymnosperms.
Under this set of node heights, it is possible that the common ancestor of Agricomycetidae and Russulales could
have been associated with a member of the Pinaceae line-

While our results suggest a minimum of six to eight independent origins of the ECM habit in Agaricomycetes, the
actual number of transformations between ECM and
saprotrophic lifestyles is surely much greater. Analyses of
Matheny et al [5] and Binder and Hibbett [1] suggest that
there were at least 14 independent origins of ECM in the
Agaricomycetidae alone (11 gains in Agaricales and three
gains in Boletales), and multiple lineages of ECM-forming
and saprotrophic taxa are intermingled in the Russulales,
Phallomycetidae, Cantharellales, and Sebacinales (it is
most parsimonious to infer a single origin of ECM in the
Thelephorales, and Hymenochaetales). Our taxon sampling does not span the root nodes of the Phallomycetidae, Cantharellales, and Sebacinales, however, and the
design of our study enables us only to reject hypotheses of
homology of the ECM habit. Thus, while the relative node
heights of Agaricomycetes and potential ECM hosts suggest that there have been at least six to eight origins of
ECM in Agaricomycetes, we expect that the actual number
of gains is higher, and we are unable to address the possibility of reversals to saprotrophy within derived clades of
Agaricomycetes. Detailed resolution of the pattern of
transformations within individual clades of Agaricomycetes will require ASR analyses, which could be constrained
according to the results of the present study. For example,
it seems reasonable to adjust the prior probabilities of the
ECM condition in the ancestor of the Agaricomycetes and
backbone nodes leading up to the Agaricomycetidae to
low values, while a 'flat' prior on symbiotic status would
be appropriate for Boletales, Russulales, or any other
group of fungi that diversified after the origin of potential
host lineages.
Our findings and the fossil record both suggest that the
first ECM associations probably involved the Pinaceae,
but there is no evidence for a general trend in the evolution of ECM associations from gymnosperm to

angiosperm hosts. Indeed, the Boletales and Russulales
each appear to be young enough to have been primitively
associated with either rosids or Pinaceae (Figures 2 and 3).
The Agaricales, in contrast, appears to be significantly
older than the rosids, but Laccaria and Amanita, two independently derived ECM-forming lineages within the Agaricales [42], are each resolved as younger than the rosids
(Table 1; Figures 3 to 5). Moreover, recent phylogenetic
studies involving ECM-forming taxa in Inocybaceae (Agaricales), Leccinum (Boletales), and Hysterangiales (Phallomycetidae), have resolved scenarios in which the
plesiomorphic hosts are angiosperms, with later switches
to Pinaceae [42-44]. Most of the larger genera of ECM
Agaricomycetes that have been investigated in detail have
been shown to associate with diverse gymnosperm and
angiosperm hosts [45]. Much of this diversity may be due
to recent host-switching events, as shown in Inocybaceae,
Leccinum, and the Phallomycetidae. At the same time, our
molecular clock analyses imply that some contemporary
ECM associations, involving both gymnosperm and
angiosperm hosts, may be the direct descendants of partnerships that were established early in the evolution of
relatively young groups of Agaricomycetes.

Conclusion
ECM symbioses have had a profound impact on the ecology of forest communities and the diversification of
plants and fungi. Reconstructing the evolution of ECM
has been difficult, however. Phylogeny-based ASR analyses, which have yielded conflicting results in fungi, are
sensitive to tree topology, taxon sampling, and assumptions about evolutionary processes. Paleobiology provides another line of evidence on the problem, but many
major groups of ECM-forming fungi have poor or nonexistent fossil records, and lack of precision in taxonomic
placements reduces the value of the few available fossils
for calibrating molecular clocks.

Our results reject the view that the ancestor of the Agaricomycetes could have been an ECM-forming species. ECM
associations involving angiosperms have evolved independently in eight major clades of Agaricomycetes, most
likely multiple times within several of these clades
(including Agaricales and Boletales), and associations
with gymnosperms have evolved independently in six to
eight clades of Agaricomycetes. The possibility that the
ancestor of the Agaricomycetidae was an ECM-forming
species cannot be firmly rejected based on our results
(because one of our three analyses suggested that the stem
node of the Pinaceae could be older than the Agaricomycetidae), although that seems unlikely based on the phylogenetic distribution of ECM and non-ECM clades in both
Agaricales and Boletales [1,5].
Looking forward, there are several promising avenues for
improving understanding of the evolution of ECM symbioses in Agaricomycetes. Tree-based ASR approaches can
now be modified based on our results; constraints can be
placed on nodes that are too old to have been involved in
ECM associations, and reconstructions that allow both
gains and losses of ECM can be performed within relatively young clades. Additional molecular clock analyses
are also needed; resolving the relative ages of the Agaricomycetidae and the Pinaceae (both stem and crown nodes)
should be a priority. This study used uncalibrated molecular clocks, which are appropriate to address the relative
ages of clades. However, it will eventually be necessary to
perform calibrated analyses to place the organismal phylogeny in the context of geological history. It seems
unlikely that the fungal fossil record will ever provide a
rich set of minimum ages for diverse nodes, such as that
available for angiosperms [32], but well-supported cases
of vicariance coupled with the geological record could
provide a basis for calibrating fungal molecular clocks.

Methods
The approach taken here is independent of both ASR and
the fungal fossil record. Our intent was not to reconstruct
the origins of ECM in Agaricomycetes in detail, but rather
to put 'brackets' on plausible histories of the character.

Our dataset contained published RPB1 and RPB2 protein
sequences (1936 amino acids, aligned) and nuclear large
and small subunit rRNA gene sequences (3435 nucleotides) from 69 species, including 42 fungi, 17 plants, and

10 other eukaryotes (Additional file 1). We conducted
alignments for the primary dataset using ClustalX, then
made manual adjustments and excluded ambiguously
aligned regions using MacClade 4.0. We constructed XML
files for BEAST analysis using BEAUTi v.1.4.4 and conducted Bayesian molecular clock analyses with BEAST
v.1.4.2 and 1.4.4, using the uncorrelated relaxed clock
with lognormal rate distribution [21,22]. We employed
the WAG+I+G model with four rate categories for proteins
(this was the optimal model selected with ProtTest 1.3
[46]), and the GTR+I+G model with four rate categories
for nucleotides, with normally distributed priors for the
parameters in models of molecular evolution, a Yule process tree model, and default values for all other settings.

We performed an unconstrained analysis and two topologically constrained analyses using BEAST. In the unconstrained analysis, we used two user-defined starting trees,
one with gnetophytes nested within conifers and the other
with gnetophytes as the sister group to seed plants (both
analyses converged to the same topology). In the constrained analyses, we used a user-defined starting tree and
deleted all of the operators from the BEAST XML file that
effect topological rearrangements. The BEAST XML file for
the unconstrained analysis has been uploaded as Additional File 2. We ran two to five independent MCMC
chains for 3.56 to 4.0 million generations total in each
analysis. We assessed convergence by inspecting the log
likelihood distributions of individual chains in Tracer and
typically discarded the first 10% of the states sampled
prior to combining results of individual chains in LogCombiner v. 1.4.4 and visualizing trees in TreeAnnotator
v.1.4.4. To assess the relative ages of clades, we compared
the 95% HPD distributions for node heights (expressed in
average numbers of substitutions per site), considering
nodes with non-overlapping 95% HPD ranges to be significantly different in age.
To visualize unconstrained branch lengths, we performed
non-clock ML analyses, using the RAxML 7.0.4 servers at
the Vital-IT Unit of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics
http://phylobench.vital-it.ch/raxml-bb/ and the CIPRES
Portal v1.14 at the San Diego Supercomputing Center
http://8ball.sdsc.edu:8889/cipres-web/Home.do[47,48].
We performed RAxML analyses with or without the topological constraint used in the BEAST analyses, retaining
Welwitischia in both cases. As in the BEAST analyses, we
employed the WAG model for proteins and the GTR
model for nucleotides. RAxML analyses used one hundred
rapid bootstrap (RBS) replicates, followed by ML optimization. Among-site rate heterogeneity was modeled with
the CAT approximation during RBS and the initial ML
optimization, switching to the discrete-gamma model
with four rate categories during the final ML optimization
[48]. The dataset used in RAxML analyses, and the optimal
