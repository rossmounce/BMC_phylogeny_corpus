Abstract
Background: Rhizobium leguminosarum is an α-proteobacterial N2-fixing symbiont of legumes that has been the subject of more
than a thousand publications. Genes for the symbiotic interaction with plants are well studied, but the adaptations that allow
survival and growth in the soil environment are poorly understood. We have sequenced the genome of R. leguminosarum biovar
viciae strain 3841.

Genome Biology 2006, 7:R34

information

Conclusion: Overall, the genome can be considered to have two main components: a 'core', which is higher in G+C, is mostly
chromosomal, is shared with related organisms, and has a consistent phylogeny; and an 'accessory' component, which is sporadic
in distribution, lower in G+C, and located on the plasmids and chromosomal islands. The accessory genome has a different
nucleotide composition from the core despite a long history of coexistence.

interactions

Results: The 7.75 Mb genome comprises a circular chromosome and six circular plasmids, with 61% G+C overall. All three
rRNA operons and 52 tRNA genes are on the chromosome; essential protein-encoding genes are largely chromosomal, but
most functional classes occur on plasmids as well. Of the 7,263 protein-encoding genes, 2,056 had orthologs in each of three
related genomes (Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Sinorhizobium meliloti, and Mesorhizobium loti), and these genes were overrepresented in the chromosome and had above average G+C. Most supported the rRNA-based phylogeny, confirming A.
tumefaciens to be the closest among these relatives, but 347 genes were incompatible with this phylogeny; these were scattered
throughout the genome but were over-represented on the plasmids. An unexpectedly large number of genes were shared by
all three rhizobia but were missing from A. tumefaciens.

Background

The symbiosis between legumes and N2-fixing bacteria
(rhizobia) is of huge agronomic benefit, allowing many crops
to be grown without N fertilizer. It is a sophisticated example
of coupled development between bacteria and higher plants,
culminating in the organogenesis of root nodules [1]. There
have been many genetic analyses of rhizobia, notably of
Sinorhizobium meliloti (the symbiont of alfalfa), Bradyrhizobium japonicum (soybean), and Rhizobium leguminosarum,
which has biovars that nodulate peas and broad beans (biovar
viciae), clovers (biovar trifolii), or kidney beans (biovar phaseoli).
The Rhizobiales, an α-proteobacterial order that also includes
mammalian pathogens Bartonella and Brucella and phytopathogenic Agrobacterium, have diverse genomic architectures. The single chromosome of Bartonella is small (1.6-1.9
Mb [2]), but the larger (approximately 3.3 Mb) Brucella
genomes comprise two circles [3-5]. Genomes of the plantassociated bacteria are larger still; that of A. tumefaciens is
about 5.6 Mb, with one circular and one linear chromosome,
plus two native plasmids [6,7]. To date, three rhizobial
genomes have been sequenced. S. meliloti 1021 has a 3.5 Mb
chromosome plus two megaplasmids, namely pSymA (1.35
Mb) and pSymB (1.68 Mb), with the former having genes for
nodulation (nod) and symbiotic N2 fixation (nif and fix) [8].
In contrast, the symbiosis genes of Mesorhizobium loti
MAFF303099 (which nodulates Lotus) and of B. japonicum
USDA110 are on chromosomal 'symbiosis islands', with the
chromosome of the latter (9.1 Mb) being among the largest
yet known in bacteria [9,10].
Rhizobium leguminosarum has yet another genomic architecture: one circular chromosome and several large plasmids,
the plasmid portfolio varying markedly among isolates in
terms of sizes, numbers, and incompatibility groups [11-14].
The subject of the present study, R. leguminosarum biovar
viciae (Rlv) strain 3841 (a spontaneous streptomycin-resistant mutant of field isolate 300 [15,16]), has six large plasmids; pRL10 is the pSym (symbiosis plasmid) and pRL7 and
pRL8 are transferable by conjugation [17].
The distinction between 'chromosome' and 'plasmid' has
become blurred in recent years with the discovery that many
bacteria have more than one replicon with over a million base
pairs. For example, the second replicon of Brucella melitensis
16M is called a chromosome (1.18 Mb) [3], whereas the equivalent in S. meliloti 1021 is referred to as a megaplasmid
(pSymB; 1.68 Mb) [8]. They both replicate using the repABC
system as is typical of plasmids, and both carry the only copies of certain essential genes, although the B. melitensis chromosome II has many more of these as well as a complete
ribosomal RNA operon. What combination of size, replication
system, rRNA genes, and essentiality should qualify a replicon to be called a chromosome is probably more a matter of
semantics than of biology.

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/4/R34

A more important distinction, in our view, is between 'core'
and 'accessory' genomes. This distinction predates the
genomics era; indeed, it has been discussed for more than a
quarter of a century. Davey and Reanney [18] contrasted 'universal' and 'peripheral' genes, or 'conserved' and 'experimental' DNA. Campbell [19] wrote of 'euchromosomal' and
'accessory' DNA and explained how gene transfer was important in shaping the latter. He pointed out that genes carried by
plasmids or transposons were 'available to all cells of the species, though not actually present in them' and 'should typically be genes that are needed occasionally rather than
continually under natural conditions'. Furthermore, the need
to function in different genetic backgrounds meant that 'evolution must limit the development of specific interactions
between their products and those of universal genes'. This
would tend to sharpen the separation between the euchromosomal and accessory gene pools, although transfer between
them would remain possible.
The expectation is that particular accessory genes will often
be absent from closely related strains or species, and as comparative data became available such genes were indeed found
in large numbers [20]. They often had a nucleotide composition different from the bulk of the genome, and this property
had previously been interpreted as evidence that they were
'foreign' genes [21]. This is plausible because nucleotide composition can be quite different between distantly related bacteria even though it is relatively consistent within genomes
[22]. This pattern is thought to reflect biased mutation rates
that tend to create a distinctive composition for each genome
[23], and if these 'foreign' genes remained long enough they
would gradually ameliorate toward the local composition
[20]. Unusual composition is not an infallible indicator of
recent acquisition [24], although there is a strong tendency
for genes acquired by Escherichia coli to be A+T rich [25].
Amelioration will be expected if genes of unusual composition are normal genes that reflect the composition of some
distant donor species [20], but an alternative explanation is
that they represent a class of genes that maintain a distinct
composition. Daubin and coworkers [26] pointed out that
phage and insertion sequences are generally A+T rich, and
suggested that many of the apparently 'foreign' genes may
actually be 'morons', which are genes of unknown function
that are carried by phages. Phages generally have a fairly limited host range, which would imply that these genes are
mostly shuttling between related strains. This brings us back
to Campbell's notion of accessory DNA [19]. Lan and Reeves
[27] expressed much the same idea when they described the
'species genome' as a combination of 'core' and 'auxiliary'
genes. We use the terms 'core' and 'accessory'.
We sequenced Rlv3841 to expose the architecture of its complex genome, and to see whether the seven replicons were
specialized in their traits. In presenting our findings, we
stress general trends more than individual genes, and explore

information

pRL7 is very different from the rest of the genome, with more
than 80% of its genes being apparently foreign and/or of
unknown function (Figure 2). In fact, 53 genes (28%) encode
putative transposases or related proteins, and 31 (including
some transposases) are pseudogenes. This plasmid appears
to have accumulated multiple mobile elements, often overlapping each other. For example, gene pRL70047A (an intron
maturase) is interrupted by pRL70047, which encodes a
homolog of the putative transposase of the Sinorhizobium
fredii repetitive sequence RFRS9 [34] and pRL70047D (conserved hypothetical), and the latter is in turn interrupted by
an IS element (pRL70047A, B, C).

interactions

All six plasmids of Rlv3841 have putative replication systems
based on repABC genes, which is the commonest system in
(and apparently confined to) α-proteobacteria. RepA and
RepB are thought to be a partitioning system that is essential
for plasmid stability, whereas RepC is needed for plasmid
replication [29,30]. Rlv3841 has the largest number of mutually compatible repABC plasmids yet found in one strain of
any bacterial species. Although clearly homologous, each of
the RepA and RepB polypeptides is highly diverged from all of
the others, presumably allowing coexistence of all six plasmids (amino acid identities range from 41% to 61% for RepA,
and from 30% to 43% for RepB). Most RepC sequences are
also diverged (55% to 68% identity) but the pRL9 and pRL12
RepCs are 97.6% identical, suggesting that a recent recombination has taken place and that divergence of RepC is not critical for plasmid compatibility. Plasmid pRL7 has an 'extra'
repABC operon (genes pRL70092-4) and a third version lacking repB (pRL70038-9).

refereed research

Plasmid replication genes

Most putatively essential genes (for example, those that
encode core transcription machinery, ribosome biosynthesis,
chaperones, and cell division) are chromosomal, but there are
exceptions. The only copies of minCDE, which - although not
absolutely essential for viability - are involved in septum formation and required for proper cell division [31], are on
pRL11 (pRL110546-8). In A. tumefaciens, S. meliloti, and B.
melitensis, minCDE are on the linear replicon, pSymB and
chromosome II, respectively, raising the possibility that
minCDE are important for segregation of large replicons
other than the main chromosome. Other 'essential' genes on
plasmids include major heat-shock chaperone genes cpn10/
cpn60 (groES/groEL) on pRL12 (pRL120643/pRL120642),
cpn60 on pRL9 (pRL90041), and ribosomal protein S21 on
pRL10 (pRL100450). However, these genes have chromosomal paralogs, so the different copies may serve specialist
functions [32] or be functionally redundant [33].

deposited research

Rlv3841 has a genome of 7,751,309 base pairs, of which 65%
is in a circular chromosome and the rest are in six circular
plasmids (Table 1 and Figure 1). This is consistent with earlier
electrophoretic and genetic data on this strain [28]. All three
rRNA operons, which are identical, and all 52 tRNA genes are
chromosomal. This is in contrast to A. tumefaciens, S.
meliloti and Brucella spp., in which some of these genes are
on a second large replicon (> 1 Mb) termed a 'megaplasmid'
or 'second chromosome' [3,6-8]. The chromosome of Rlv3841
(5.06 Mb) is much larger than those of A. tumefaciens (2.84
Mb), S. meliloti (3.65 Mb) and B. melitensis (2.12 Mb), and
the total plasmid content (2.69 Mb) is also large.

The chromosome and all plasmids except one (pRL7) are
remarkably similar in their mix of functional classes (Figure
2). Core functions (to the left in Figure 2) are most abundant
on the chromosome, but they are also strongly represented on
the plasmids. The proportion of novel and uncharacterized
genes ('no known homologues' or 'conserved hypothetical') is
as high on the chromosome (31.5%) as it is on the plasmids
(30%).

The 8-base motif GGGCAGGG is much more frequent in αproteobacterial chromosomes than expected [36]. Its orientation is biased to the leading replication strand and it is most
frequent near the terminus of replication, although the reasons for this have not yet been elucidated. Its distribution on
the Rlv3841 chromosome clearly illustrates this pattern (Figure 6). Of the 357 copies of the motif, 346 are oriented from
origin to terminus (taking about 5,000,000 and about
2,592,000 as the presumed origin and terminus, respectively). The motif is more abundant near the terminus
(approximately one every 7 kb) than near the origin (every 25
kb). A novel observation is that it also occurs on plasmids,
with a similar frequency and strand bias (Figure 6). However,
there is one anomaly; the motif pattern on pRL12 predicts an
origin at about 400,000 rather than near repABC. This suggests either that replication initiation of pRL12 is not near
repABC or that pRL12 has recently been rearranged but can
survive and replicate with the 'wrong' motif distribution.

Core genes and their phylogeny

information

We identified 648 Rlv3841 genes, 97% of them chromosomal,
that have orthologs in each of six other fully sequenced α-proteobacterial genomes (identified in Figure 7). Overall, a phylogeny based on all of these 648 proteins (Figure 7) is
consistent with the species relationships inferred from 16S
ribosomal RNA, in which the closest relative of R. leguminosarum is A. tumefaciens, followed by S. meliloti, and then
M. loti. However, many individual proteins actually support
different phylogenetic relationships. To study this phylogenetic discordance in more detail we focused on four genomes,
namely Rlv3841, A. tumefaciens, S. meliloti, and M. loti,
which simplifies the analysis because there are just three possible topologies for an unrooted phylogeny of four organisms.
We identified 2056 quartops (quartets of orthologous pro-

interactions

Dinucleotide relative abundance (DRA) is usually thought to
be relatively homogeneous within a bacterial species but different between genomes, even of close relatives [35]. The
closest sequenced relative of Rlv3841 is A. tumefaciens C58,
but the DRAs of these two genomes are consistently different,
with no overlap (Figure 5). The C58 linear replicon and large
parts of Rlv plasmids pRL12, pRL11, pRL10, and pRL9 have
very similar compositions to their respective chromosomes,
implying that they have been confined to a narrow range of
hosts long enough to acquire the distinctive DRA characteristic of their host. In contrast, the DRAs of pAT, pTi, pRL7 and
pRL8, as well as parts of pRL10 and pRL11, resemble each
other but are very distinct from those of the corresponding
chromosomes (Figure 5). Plasmids pRL7 and pRL8 are transferable by conjugation [7,17], and so they may be part of a
pool of mobile replicons that have not equilibrated to the DRA
of their current host genomes. Some regions of the chromosomes and larger plasmids also have this distinctive DRA,
perhaps reflecting the recent insertion of 'islands' of mobile
DNA. Inclusion of two more genomes, namely those of S.
meliloti and M. loti, in a similar analysis does not change the
overall picture (KHH and JPWY, unpublished data); the core
DNA forms genome-specific clusters whereas the accessory
DNA of all four genomes has similar DRA.

local variation, and a plot of GC3s (G+C content of synonymous third positions) reveals many chromosomal 'islands', in
which most genes have below average GC3s (Figures 3 and 4).
Several of the most distinct islands, for instance RL0790RL0841 (54 kilobases [kb]), RL2105-RL2200 (105 kb),
RL3627-3670 (52 kb) and RL3941-RL3956 (12 kb), precisely
abut a tRNA gene; this suggests that they may be mobile elements that target tRNA genes, as has been described for the
symbiosis island of M. loti [10] and many genomic and pathogenicity islands in other bacteria.

teins [37]) in these four genomes (the 648 proteins above are,
of course, a subset of these). The consensus topology that is
implied by Figure 7 was indeed the best supported: 551 quartops supported A. tumefaciens as the closest relative of
Rlv3841 (with > 99% posterior probability). However, 222
supported S. meliloti and 125 M. loti as the closest relative of
Rlv3841 (Table 2). The remaining quartops have insufficient
phylogenetic signal to support any topology with probability
above 99%.
Overall, the quartops represent only 27% of the 7,263 proteinencoding genes of Rlv3841. Although 38% of chromosomal
genes encode quartop proteins, only 10% of plasmid genes do
so. Even among chromosomal quartops, only 66% (488/745)
of those with strong phylogenetic signal support the consensus phylogeny. Replacement of the original ortholog by horizontal gene transfer may explain why so many genes,
especially on plasmids, support nonconventional phylogenies. Such discordant phylogenies must have arisen from
many individual events, not just a few transfers of large
regions, because the genes are scattered across the genome
(Figure 3).

There is a strong relationship between phylogenetic distribution and the nucleotide composition of genes. Genes in the
quartops have GC3s (mean ± standard error) of 77.9 ± 0.2%,
irrespective of the phylogeny that they support, but the GC3s
of nonquartop genes is only 72.6 ± 0.1%.
For a broader view of gene relationships, we recorded the
presence or absence of a close homolog of each Rlv3841 gene
in each of the three related genomes (Table 3). There are
2,253 genes that occur in all three, 2,272 that are absent from
all, and 2,740 that occur in some but not all of the other
genomes (identified in Additional data file 1). The largest category in this last class comprises 546 genes that are shared by
all three rhizobia but are missing from A. tumefaciens, which
is surprising in light of the core phylogeny. Furthermore, 264
of these genes have close homologs in Bradyrhizobium
japonicum, which shares the phenotype of root nodule symbiosis with the other rhizobia but is much more distantly
related according to its core genes (Figure 7). This set of 264
genes includes, of course, the known symbiosis-related genes
(discussed below under Nitrogen fixation), but we hypothesized that many of the others might have unrecognized roles
in symbiosis. However, after excluding the known symbiosis
genes, the representation of the Riley functional classes was

polymerase σ factors, and Rlv3841 is predicted to have 11 on
the chromosome, one on pRL10, and two each on pRL11 and
pRL12 (Table 4). In addition to the 'housekeeping' RpoD,
there are two RpoH (heat shock), one RpoN (which is
involved, among other things, in assimilation of certain N
sources), plus other σ factors of the ECF (extracytoplasmic
factor) subclass [39], only some of whose targets are known.

information

RNA polymerase σ factors

The chromosomal rpoD, rpoN, and rpoH genes exemplify the
core genome, their products being highly conserved in close
relatives (Table 5). Only one other σ factor gene (RL3703,
rpoZ), which is of unknown function [40], had this pattern. In
contrast, other Rlv3841 σ factor genes only occur in some of
its close relatives or in none at all. One such 'Rlv-only' gene is
rpoI (pRL120319), which encodes an ECF σ factor for promoters of the adjacent vbs genes, which are involved in
siderophore synthesis and which are also missing from the
other related genomes [41]. Thus both rpoI and its vbs 'targets' are part of the Rlv accessory genome. The GC3s of the σ
factor genes generally concurs with their proposed core or
accessory status. Thus, rpoD, rpoN, rpoZ, and the two rpoH
all have GC3s above 77%. In contrast, pRL120319 has only
64% GC3s and pRL120580 is even lower (59%). One striking

interactions

not significantly different among these genes from that in the
genome as a whole, and so there is no obvious evidence that
they are enriched in genes that encode a particular kind of
function. The Riley classes provide only a broad outline of
course, especially for genomes with many genes of unknown
function. However, if a significant difference existed it could
readily be detected, as illustrated in the case of pRL7 (Figure
3). As more genome sequences become available there will be
scope for more comprehensive analyses, which might include
other measures such as the distribution of protein domain
classes [38]. There is no evidence to suggest that any of these
genes shared by rhizobia is directly regulated by NodD,
because none of them has a nod box regulatory sequence.
Apart from the four known nod boxes that regulate nodA,
nodF, nodM, and nodO, the only putative nod boxes that we
found in the genome were upstream of RL4088 and
pRL120452, both of which encode putative transmembrane
proteins of unknown function, but neither of which are in the
rhizobium-specific gene set.

domains. Apart from the complete operons, there are many
orphan genes and gene pairs for ABC transport systems. Altogether, we have identified 816 genes that encode putative
components of ABC transporters, which represent 11% of the
total protein complement (see Additional data file 1 for a full
list).

Given their below average representation in quartops, it is
paradoxical that the transporter genes have a high average
GC3s of 79.1% (genome average 74.3%). As with other genes,
those in quartops have higher mean GC3s (81.1%) than those
that are not (78.6%). All the genes within a particular ABC
transporter operon generally have fairly similar GC3s and,
with a few exceptions, the operons are in high-GC3s regions
of the genome and conspicuously absent from low-GC3s
islands (Figure 8).

Only 23% of the ABC transporter genes belong to quartops
(Table 6), as compared with the genome average of 38%.
There are remarkable differences between the replicons in
this respect; more than one-third of the transporter genes on
the chromosome and pRL11 are in quartops, whereas the proportion is much lower on the other plasmids, down to a mere
7% on pRL12 (Table 6).

exception is pRL110418, whose product (of unknown function) is absent from close relatives of Rlv but resembles σ factors in B. japonicum and in actinomycetes. It has higher GC3s
(79%) than is typical for the Rlv accessory genome, although
lower than that of the related genes in Bradyrhizobium (84%)
or the actinomycetes (84-94%). It is possible that this is a
genuinely 'foreign' gene with a composition that still reflects
its origin, rather than a long-term component of the accessory
genome.

ABC transporter systems
Rhizobia are known to be rich in ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters, and there are 183 complete ABC operons in
Rlv3841 (Table 5). The corresponding genes are widely distributed in the genome but they are particularly abundant on
pRL12, pRL10, and especially pRL9 (Table 6 and Figure 8). In
fact, they make up 27% of all genes on pRL9. Complete uptake
systems contain genes for a solute binding protein, at least
one integral membrane protein, and at least one ABC protein,
whereas export systems do not have solute binding proteins.
The total number of ABC domains is greater than the number
of genes shown in Table 5 because many genes contain two
fused ABC domains. For example, of the 269 ABC genes in
Rlv3841, 53 are fusions yielding 322 ABC domains. There are
also 19 examples of ABC domains fused to membrane protein

General metabolic pathways
R. leguminosarum is considered to be an obligate aerobe, and
most of the genes in central metabolism are consistent with
this. For example, the genome of Rlv3841 contains all of the
genes for a functional TCA cycle on the chromosome (see
Additional data file 3). There are actually three candidate
genes for citrate synthase (RL2508, RL2509, and RL2234) on
the chromosome of Rlv3841. R. tropici has two citrate synthase genes, one of which, namely pcsA, is present on its
pSym and affects nodulating ability and Fe uptake [42]. The
genome of Rlv3841 contains genes for isocitrate lyase
(RL0761) and malate synthase (RL0054), which would allow
a gloxylate cycle to operate, although strain 3841 does not
grow on acetate. There are six genes whose products closely
resemble
succinate
semialdehyde
dehydrogenases
(pRL100134,
pRL100252,
pRL120044,
pRL120603,
pRL120628, and RL0101), which could feed succinate semialdehyde directly into the TCA cycle. Two of these (pRL100134
and pRL100252) are on the symbiosis plasmid, and RL0101 is
the characterized gabD gene [43]. Succinate semialdehyde is
the keto acid released from 4-aminobutyric acid, an amino
acid that is present at high levels in pea nodules and is a possible candidate for amino acid cycling in bacteroids. The
importance of this is that amino acid cycling has been proposed to be essential for productive N2 fixation in pea nodules
[44].
Most free-living rhizobia are believed to use the Entner-Doudoroff or pentose phosphate pathways to catabolize sugars,
and to lack the Emden-Meyerhof pathway [45,46]. This is
related to the absence of phosphofructokinase enzyme activ-

aNumber of quartops supporting the phylogeny ([R. leguminosarum, A. tumefaciens], [S. meliloti, M. loti]) with at least 99% probability (and likewise for
the other two possible topologies). Rlv3841, Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae 3841.

Nitrogen fixation
The 13 nod genes that are known to be involved in nodulation
of the host plant are tightly clustered on pRL10 (pRL100175,
0178-0189). Nearby are the rhiABCR genes (pRL1001690172) that also influence nodulation [48]. These nodulation
genes are surrounded by genes needed for nitrogen fixation:
nifHDKEN (pRL100162-0158), nifAB (0196-0195), fixABCX
(0200-0197), and fixNOQPGHIS (0205-0210A). The latter
cluster has GC3s values (66-76%) that approach the genome
mean (73.4%), whereas all of the other symbiosis-related
genes mentioned above have strikingly low GC3s (51-66%).
There is a homolog of nodT (pRL100291) of unknown function that is also on pRL10 but is more than 100 kb away and
has much higher GC3s (72.5%).
Perhaps surprisingly, there is no nifS gene whose product is a
cysteine desulphurase, which is believed to be involved in
making the FeS clusters of nitrogenase in other diazotrophs
such as Klebsiella, Azotobacter, and Rhodobacter spp. In
these genera, nifS is closely linked to other nif genes, and this
is also true for nifS in B. japonicum (blr 1756) and M. loti
(Mll5865). It is not clear how the FeS clusters are made for
the nitrogenases of R. leguminosarum and S. meliloti (which
also lacks nifS). Most bacteria possess SufS, a cysteine desulphurase that is normally is involved in making the 'housekeeping' levels of FeS clusters. Interestingly, the R.
leguminosarum suf operon has two copies of sufS (RL2583
and RL2578), and so these may also supply FeS for the nitrogenase protein. Alternatively, the function of NifS may be
accomplished by a protein with a wholly different sequence
whose identity has not yet been recognized.
Rhizobium leguminosarum strain VF39 has two versions of
the fixNOQP genes, which encode the symbiotically essential
cbb3 high affinity terminal oxidase [49]. Both copies are active
and both copies must be mutated to give a clear effect on symbiosis [50]. Likewise, Rlv3841 has one fixNOQP set on pRL10
(pRL100205-0207) and another copy on pRL9 (pRL90016-

0018). As in strain VF39, genes for fixK (pRL90019) and fixL
(pRL90020) are upstream of fixNOQP on pRL9. The complexity of regulation mediated by the predicted oxygenresponsive FixK-like regulators [49] is indicated by the fact
that R. leguminosarum has no fewer than five fixK homologs,
three of which (pRL90019, pRL90025, and pRL90012) are
on plasmid pRL9. The global regulator of fix genes in R. leguminosarum is FnrN, and this is encoded in single copy on the
chromosome (RL2818), although another strain of this species, namely UPM791, has two copies [51]. The fix genes on
pRL9 are closely linked to other genes that are involved in
respiration, (for example azuP, pRL90021).

Strain 3841 as a representative of the species
Rhizobium leguminosarum
Strains within a bacterial species can differ by the presence or
absence of large numbers of genes [52-54]. To date, Rlv3841
is the only sequenced strain of R. leguminosarum, but genetic
studies of other strains have identified genes that are absent
in Rlv3841, for example the pSym-borne hup genes for the
uptake dehydrogenase system, which has been studied in
some detail in another R. leguminosarum strain [55,56].
Rlv3841 has six plasmids, but other natural R. leguminosarum strains have from two to six plasmids of various sizes
[11,12]. The pSym of Rlv3841 is pRL10 (488 kb), in the repC3
group [14], but other pSyms differ in size and replication
groups [57]. Detailed genetic analysis of symbiosis in R. leguminosarum biovar viciae has focused on pRL1, a 200 kb
repC4 plasmid [57]. The nod and nif genes of pRL1
(nucleotide accession Y00548) and pRL10 differ in just 23
nucleotides over 12 kb, which is far less than occurs between
such genes of other strains of this species [58,59]. Thus, by
chance, the symbiotic regions of pRL1 and pRL10 are very
similar, although the plasmids are different, implying recent
transfer of symbiosis genes between distantly related
plasmids.

aGenes

of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae 3841 (Rlv3841) are classified by whether they are unique to this genome (R) or have homologs in
the genomes of A. tumefaciens (A), S. meliloti (S), or M. loti (M). bOf the 546 genes shared by the three rhizobia (R+S+M) but missing from A, 264 had
homologs in B. japonicum, a distantly related rhizobium. Rlv3841, Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae 3841.

In what follows, we very briefly point out some of the salient
features of each of the seven replicons.

Why is the genome so large?
Rlv3841 has more genes than budding yeast [60] and more
'chromosomes' than fission yeast [61]. Like Rlv, many bacteria with large genomes are soil dwellers (for example, Streptomyces, Bradyrhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Ralstonia,
Burkholderia, and Pseudomonas spp.). Soil is a heterogeneous environment with patchy distribution of many different
substrates and potential hazards, and so a genome that
encoded multiple capabilities 'just in case' would have a longterm selective advantage. The large number of transporters
and regulators is consistent with this idea; a wide range of
substrates can be taken up, but the pathways should be tightly
regulated or the metabolic burden would be excessive. This
versatility is unnecessary for rhizobia in the predictable environment of the legume nodule, but these bacteria must
survive in the soil for years between these symbiotic
opportunities, and their panoply of uptake systems suggests
that they are often metabolically active during this phase.
However, omnivory is not the only possible strategy for survival in soil; Nitrosomonas, for example, is a specialist in NH3
oxidation and has a genome of just 2.8 Mb [62].

Genome Biology 2006, 7:R34

information

pRL10 has two parts which differ in composition (Figure 3).
The first part of the sequence (about the first 200 genes)
includes the symbiosis genes and has archetypal characteristics of the accessory genome: low GC3s and very few quartops
(the known nod and nif symbiosis genes are not among the
quartops, being absent from A. tumefaciens). The rest of
pRL10 resembles the larger plasmids in being mostly highGC3s with occasional low-GC3s islands.

Discussion

interactions

pRL11 is the most chromosome-like plasmid, although both
the proportion of quartops and their support for the consensus phylogeny are much lower than the chromosomal values.
This plasmid carries the cell division genes minCDE.

pRL7 is an assemblage of mobile elements, dominated by
repeated sequences, including many derived from phages and
transposable elements. It has many pseudogenes and a short
average gene length (Table 1). It has two complete, unrelated
sets of replication genes and parts of a third.

refereed research

pRL12, the largest plasmid, has a nucleotide composition like
that of the chromosome (Figures 2 and 4) but only 9% of its
genes are in quartops (Table 2), and these put Rlv3841 closer
to S. meliloti than to the more closely related A. tumefaciens
(Figure 7). The 23 genes supporting the S. meliloti relationship are in several small clusters, the largest of which
(pRL120605-pRL120613; 10.7 kb) comprises an ABC transporter operon and some flanking genes that are in the same
arrangement, with more than 80% amino acid identity, on
pSymA of S. meliloti.

pRL8 is uniformly 'accessory', with low GC3s and no
quartops.
deposited research

On the chromosome, most genes have high GC3s content
(Figure 3), and the DRA is fairly uniform when averaged over
100 kb windows (Figure 5). Nevertheless, the chromosome is
studded with islands of genes that appear to be accessory by
two criteria: their GC3s is lower and they are not in quartops
(Figure 4).

pRL9 has low GC3s, with two high-GC3s regions, and few
quartops. More than a quarter of the genes encode ABC
transporters.

Is there a core genome and an accessory genome?
Our concept of the accessory genome is of a pool of genes that
have a long-term association with a bacterial species or group
of species but are adapted to a nomadic life. An accessory
gene moves readily between strains but will be found in only
a subset of strains at any one time. Each bacterial genome we
look at has many genes that are not seen elsewhere ('ORFans'
[63]) or that have a sporadic distribution in other known
genomes. These are often interpreted as newly acquired
genes, particularly if their composition is not typical of the
genome, but we suggest that many may in fact have a longterm association with the species but a patchy distribution
across strains. There is a parallel between this concept and
the view of phages as the source of a pool of potentially
adaptive genes [26], because each phage generally has a limited host range. In this section we interpret the Rlv3841
genome in the light of these ideas.
Our survey of the genes of Rlv3841 considered their location,
function, composition, and phylogeny. The genome is heterogeneous in all four respects, but patterns emerge when they
are considered jointly. The archetypal 'core' genes are on the
chromosome, have an essential function in cell maintenance,

have a high G+C content, and have orthologs in related species that conform in their relationships with the species phylogeny deduced from rRNA sequences. All of these properties
are positively correlated, and some genes exhibit all of them.
However, these are surprisingly few (1,541), accounting for
less than one-third of the genes on the chromosome.
At the other end of the spectrum are archetypal 'accessory'
genes that are located on plasmids, that confer sporadically
useful adaptations, that are lower in G+C, and that are missing from some related genomes or, if present, exhibit phylogenetic evidence for horizontal transfer. The nod genes
illustrate all of these points, but there are hundreds of other
genes with similar properties, their annotated functions varying from fairly specific (sugar transporter, response regulator) to 'conserved hypothetical' or 'no significant database
hits'. We know the exact functions of most nod genes [1], but
this reflects many years of study without which the nod region
would have been just one more tract of vaguely annotated
genes. Indeed, some of the genes would probably have
attracted misleading annotations, such as 'involved in chitin
synthesis' for nodC [64]. We presume that many other accessory genes are like the nod genes in having specific functions

The hypothesis that the composition of accessory genes
reflects the genomic norm of their donor would require that
there is an unknown 'real rhizobium' out there, with low
genomic GC3s, that has relatively recently donated the nod
genes to all the diverse nodulating bacteria currently known.
This seems highly implausible, and in fact a recent radiation
is ruled out by the high sequence divergence among homologous nod genes [67]. Instead, the example of the nodulation
genes points to the existence of an accessory gene pool that
maintains a distinctive composition despite an apparent
long-term cohabitation with core genomes that equilibrate to
quite different compositions. The age of the common ancestor
of nodulated legumes has been estimated at 59 million years
[68], and the nodulation (nod) genes that determine host specificity have probably been diverging for a similar length of
time. Although this has been long enough for sequence divergence in excess of 60% [69], nod genes are certainly much

The distinction between core and accessory genomes is well
illustrated by the large Rlv3841 genome with its multiple replicons, but this appears to be a widespread property of bacterial genomes [26]. Genes in E. coli that have no known
homologs in other genomes (for instance, ORFans) are short,
have low G+C and evolve rapidly, but they ameliorate to the
core genome composition very slowly [71]. We can only speculate on whether the distinctive composition of accessory
genes is due to selection for properties favorable for gene
transfer, or to different mutational bias, perhaps reflecting a
history of replication in plasmids or phages rather than chromosomes. Low G+C is typical of genes in phages, including
'morons' [26], which are not needed for phage functions and
may be thought of as host accessory genes in transit. A low
G+C content may make DNA less susceptible to attack by
restriction enzymes [26] and more likely to undergo recombination [72]. Phages appear to be the major vectors of the
accessory gene pool in E. coli and are probably significant in
rhizobia too, but large transmissible plasmids such as pRL7
and pRL8 are common in rhizobia and probably play an
important role. Not all accessory genes are currently on plasmids but their location varies between genomes, and so it is
plausible that any accessory gene will have spent part of its
recent history on plasmids, as supposed by Campbell [19].
The chromosome of Rlv3841 has many distinct 'islands' of
genes with typical accessory characteristics: low GC3s and a
sporadic phylogenetic distribution (Figure 3). This subset is
rich in genes of unknown function. These are part of the
accessory genome residing, probably temporarily, in the
chromosome.

deposited research

The low GC3s of the accessory genes (Figure 3), also reflected
in their distinctive DRA (Figure 5), marks them as different
from the core genome. Such genes occur in most sequenced
genomes, and are usually regarded as recent arrivals via horizontal gene transfer from a donor whose composition they
are presumed to reflect [20]. However, a consideration of the
Rlv3841 genome challenges this view. First, acquisition from
arbitrary donors cannot explain the relatively consistent composition of the accessory genome (Figure 5); many segments
of R. leguminosarum plasmids resemble the Agrobacterium
plasmids in composition, but none resemble the Agrobacterium chromosomes. Even more compellingly, nod genes consistently have lower GC3s than is typical for the host genome
in any of the wide range of both α-proteobacteria and β-proteobacteria that are known to carry them [65,66], and those
of Rlv3841 conform to this pattern (Figure 3).

more recent than the common ancestor of all of the bacteria
that currently carry them; Rhizobium and Bradyrhizobium
are thought to have been separated for 500 million years [70]
and the β-proteobacterial symbionts are, of course, more distant still. The nod genes are therefore indisputably part of the
horizontally transferred accessory gene pool.

More enigmatic are the many genes that are not in quartops,
which indeed are often unique to Rlv3841, and yet have the
typical composition of the core genome. These are not readily
classified as either typical accessory or core genes but may
form a third category. Possible examples are the σ factor
genes pRL100385, pRL110418, and pRL110007, which all
have high GC3s but no orthologs in S. meliloti or A. tumefaciens, and many of the ABC transporter genes (Figure 8).
Genes with these characteristics are particularly abundant on
the large plasmids of Rlv3841 (Figure 3), and unrelated genes
with similar characteristics are found on the second chromosomes of Agrobacterium and Brucella and pSymB of Sinorhizobium [3,6-8]. Their composition implies a long-term
relationship with their host genome, but their sporadic distribution suggests that they confer special, perhaps strain-specific or species-specific, adaptations rather than core
functions.
Although there are consistent average differences between
the core and (one or more) accessory classes of genes, the
dividing line is not clear cut. There is a continuous, unimodal
distribution of GC3s values (Figure 3), and the designation of
'core' depends on the choice of genomes for comparison. Furthermore, there are some accessory genes, such as pRL110418
(for the actinomycete-like σ factor) that appear to be genuinely 'foreign' and do not have the composition of the longterm accessory genome. The notion of distinct categories is, of
course, an oversimplification, but it provides a framework for
understanding the organization of the genome.

http://genomebiology.com/2006/7/4/R34

Questions that the genome raises about bacterial
function, evolution, and ecology
The genome of Rlv3841 is a snapshot of one example of an R.
leguminosarum genome. We know that the number and size
of plasmids, and the complement of genes, differ in other isolates of the species. Now that we have so many snapshots of
bacterial genomes, the challenge is to elucidate the assembly
rules. What is constant and what is ephemeral? Which parts
of the accessory genome are species specific, and which range
more widely? If accessory genes are adapted to a nomadic life
in which they perpetually move between genomes, how is
their regulation integrated into the host cell? The fact that
Rlv3841 shares more genes with the other rhizobia S. meliloti
and M. loti than with its closer relative A. tumefaciens (Table
3) supports the idea that the accessory genome is related to
lifestyle and that accessory genes can confer different ecologic
niches on similar core genomes. This conclusion must be tempered, though, by the realization that bacteria can be multifunctional and isolates that successfully combine rhizobial
and agrobacterial properties have been found [73].
If accessory genes are sporadically distributed and mobile,
then similarity in the core genome does not guarantee that
bacteria are similar in ecology (for example, R. leguminosarum and A. tumefaciens). In the face of a transient accessory
genome, does a genomic species have sufficient ecologic
coherence to maintain its identity? This is an important question in relation to our understanding of the nature of bacterial
species. Cohan has argued that periodic selection purges variation among ecologically equivalent bacteria, and this creates the genetic coherence that allows species to be defined
[74]. However, if an ecologic niche is conferred by the accessory genome then it will not be tightly correlated with the core
genome, which includes the ribosomal RNA and other genes
typically considered to define species. For bacteria with large
accessory genomes, genetic processes (homologous recombination) may be more important than ecologic processes (periodic selection) in maintaining coherence of the core genome
of the species.
A related issue concerns the numerous surveys of bacterial
diversity based on libraries of ribosomal RNA genes [75].
Although these have been very successful in expanding our
awareness of microbial communities, the ecologic
significance of the diversity [76] is more difficult to establish
because of the weak linkage between core genome and accessory adaptations. On the other hand, metagenomic studies
give us access to the ecologically important accessory genes (if
only we knew how to read them!) but, except in the simplest
communities, we do not know with which core genomes they
are associated [77].

Conclusion

The genome of R. leguminosarum strain 3841 is unusual in
having six large plasmids in addition to a large chromosome.

Materials and methods

The final assembly was based on 60,600 paired end-reads
from a pUC18 library (insert sizes 3.0-3.3 kb) and 54,700
paired end-reads from a pMAQ1b library (inserts 5.5-6.0 kb),
with a further 9,000 single reads from an m13mp18 library to
give 7.6-fold sequence coverage of the genome. To produce a
scaffold, 2520 reads were generated from a 23-48 kb insert
library in pBACe3.6, giving about 5.8× clone coverage.
Sequencing was done using Amersham Big-Dye (Amersham,
UK) terminator chemistry on ABI3700 sequencing machines.
The sequence was assembled with Phrap (Green P, unpublished data) and finished using GAP4 [79]. To finish the
sequence, approximately 13,400 extra reads were generated
to fill gaps and ensure that all bases were covered by reads on
both strands or with different chemistries. All identified
repeats were bridged using read-pairs or end-sequenced
polymerase chain reaction products. The three rRNA operons
were identical; whole-genome shotgun reads did not indicate
any polymorphisms, and each operon was independently
sequenced from BAC clones or long-range polymerase chain
reaction products to confirm this.

Bacteria with large complex genomes are abundant and
important in nature, and so this genome of Rlv3841 should
serve as a further reference point for developing our understanding in many directions.

refereed research

At least two-thirds and perhaps more than 90% of its 7,263
genes must be considered accessory because they are not universally shared even among closely related species. The core,
putatively essential, genes have a characteristic high G+C
composition, whereas the accessory genes range from those
that share this core-like composition, such as many ABC
transporter genes, to those that have much lower G+C,
including most known symbiosis-related genes. Accessory
genes are more frequent on the plasmids, but are also found
in genomic islands scattered through the chromosome. They
surely hold the key to unraveling bacterial adaptation and
specialization, but for the moment the great majority remain
of unknown function.

The finished sequence was annotated using Artemis software
[80]. Initial coding sequence predictions were performed
using Orpheus and Glimmer2 software [81,82]. The two predictions were amalgamated, and codon usage, positional base
preference, and comparisons with nonredundant protein
databases using BLAST and FASTA software were used to
curate the predictions. The entire DNA sequence was also
compared in all six reading frames against nonredundant
protein databases, using BLASTX, to identify all possible coding sequences. Protein motifs were identified with Pfam and
Prosite, transmembrane domains with TMHMM [83], signal
sequences with SignalP [84], rRNA genes with BLASTN, and
tRNAs with tRNAscan-SE [85]. Functional assignments, EC
numbers, and other information, including functional classes
in the Riley classification [86], were all manually curated.
Artemis Comparison Tool [87] was used to visualize BLASTN
and TBLASTX comparisons between genomes. Pseudogenes
had one or more inactivating mutations, which were checked
against the original sequencing data.

Additional data files

The data have been submitted to the EMBL database (accession numbers AM236080 to AM236086).

Quartets of orthologous proteins (quartops) were sets of
reciprocal top-scoring BLASTP hits (putative orthologs) in all
pairwise genome comparisons between R. leguminosarum,
S. meliloti, M. loti, and A tumefaciens [37]. A narrower 'core'
was similarly defined using additional comparisons with B.
japonicum, Brucella melitensis, and Caulobacter crescentus.
Genome sequences for these comparisons were downloaded
from GenBank. For each quartop, the three posterior probabilities were calculated with MrBayes version 3 [88].
Symmetrized DRA frequencies were calculated in each replicon for nonoverlapping windows of varying sizes using custom-made Perl scripts. This calculation is based on an odds
ratio, which considers the observed frequency divided by the
expected frequency of each dinucleotide [22,35,89-91]. Symmetrized frequencies were obtained by concatenating the
original sequence with its inverted complementary sequence;
this reduced the 16 original dinucleotides to 10 and controlled
for strand bias, allowing for the comparison of different species. This analysis results in a 10 × n matrix, where n is the
number of genomic windows. Principal components analysis
was carried out in MATLAB version 6.5 release 13 using the
MVARTOOLS toolbox. The percentage variance represented
by each principal component was assessed through the construction of a scree plot. With 84.5% of the total variance
explained by principal components 1 and 2, these axes alone
were deemed sufficient for analysis (PC1 48.9% and PC2
35.6%).
GC3s content of individual genes was calculated using
CODONW [92].

The following additional data are included with the online
version of this article: A text file containing a tab-separated
table of all of the protein-encoding genes with Riley functional class, location, GC3s, peptide length, quartop membership, presence/absence of homologs in related species, and
