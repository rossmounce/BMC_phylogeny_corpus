CREST - a large and diverse superfamily of
putative transmembrane hydrolases
Jimin Pei1*, Douglas P Millay2, Eric N Olson2 and Nick V Grishin1,3

Abstract
Background: A number of membrane-spanning proteins possess enzymatic activity and catalyze important
reactions involving proteins, lipids or other substrates located within or near lipid bilayers. Alkaline ceramidases are
seven-transmembrane proteins that hydrolyze the amide bond in ceramide to form sphingosine. Recently, a group
of putative transmembrane receptors called progestin and adipoQ receptors (PAQRs) were found to be distantly
related to alkaline ceramidases, raising the possibility that they may also function as membrane enzymes.
Results: Using sensitive similarity search methods, we identified statistically significant sequence similarities among
several transmembrane protein families including alkaline ceramidases and PAQRs. They were unified into a large
and diverse superfamily of putative membrane-bound hydrolases called CREST (alkaline ceramidase, PAQR receptor,
Per1, SID-1 and TMEM8). The CREST superfamily embraces a plethora of cellular functions and biochemical
activities, including putative lipid-modifying enzymes such as ceramidases and the Per1 family of putative
phospholipases involved in lipid remodeling of GPI-anchored proteins, putative hormone receptors, bacterial
hemolysins, the TMEM8 family of putative tumor suppressors, and the SID-1 family of putative double-stranded
RNA transporters involved in RNA interference. Extensive similarity searches and clustering analysis also revealed
several groups of proteins with unknown function in the CREST superfamily. Members of the CREST superfamily
share seven predicted core transmembrane segments with several conserved sequence motifs.
Conclusions: Universal conservation of a set of histidine and aspartate residues across all groups in the CREST
superfamily, coupled with independent discoveries of hydrolase activities in alkaline ceramidases and the Per1
family as well as results from previous mutational studies of Per1, suggests that the majority of CREST members are
metal-dependent hydrolases.

Background
Membrane proteins play important roles in various biological processes such as transportation and signal transduction across the membrane. Although a significant
fraction of proteins in genomes are predicted to be integral membrane proteins [1], our understandings of their
function, mechanism and evolution remain limited due
to experimental difficulties in assaying their activities and
obtaining their structures. The low complexity of the
hydrophobic membrane-spanning segments also renders
transmembrane proteins difficult targets for computational sequence analysis and structure prediction [2].

Membrane-bound enzymes catalyze a variety of key
reactions involving proteins, lipids or other substrates
within or near lipid bilayers. A limited number of membrane-bound enzymes with known structures exist, including several intramembrane proteases [3] and members of
the MAPEG (membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid
and glutathione metabolism) family [4]. A family of alkaline ceramidases, which are seven-transmembrane proteins
without known structures, catalyze the hydrolysis of the
amide bond in ceramide to form sphingosine [5]. Sphingosine, ceramide and their phosphorylated products are
bioactive sphingolipid molecules involved in a number of
biological processes [6]. Recently, a large group of putative
transmembrane hormone receptors called progestin and
adipoQ receptors (PAQRs) were found to be distantly
related to alkaline ceramidases, raising the possibility that

they may also function as membrane enzymes [7,8]. Interestingly, the bacterial homologs of these receptors have
hemolysin activities [9].
In this study, we employed sensitive sequence comparison methods to search for homologs of alkaline ceramidases and PAQRs. Three additional known protein
families were identified: the Per1 family of fatty acid remodeling hydrolases for GPI-anchored proteins [10,11], the
SID-1 family of putative RNA transporters involved in systematic RNA interference [12,13], and the TMEM8 family
of putative tumor suppressors [14,15]. In addition, we
identified distant homologs comprising five distinct groups
of proteins with unknown function. We unified these proteins into a superfamily of putative transmembrane hydrolases called CREST (alkaline ceramidase, PAQR receptor,
Per1, SID-1 and TMEM8). They share a core structure of
seven predicted transmembrane segments and five conserved residues (three histidines, one aspartic acid and one
serine). Sequence conservation and mutational studies in
the Per1 family [10] suggest that most members of this
superfamily are metal-dependent hydrolases. Our analyses
and predictions offer insights into functions and mechanisms for members in this diverse superfamily.

Results
Sequence similarity searches and homology inference for
the CREST superfamily

Extensive transitive PSI-BLAST [16] searches (see Methods for details) uncovered statistically significant sequence
similarities between alkaline ceramidases, PAQR receptors,
bacterial hemolysins III, the SID-1 family, and the
TMEM8 family. For example, a PSI-BLAST search starting
with a human alkaline ceramidase ACER3 (NCBI gene
identification (gi) number: 296439452, with an e-value
inclusion cutoff of 1e-4) found a bacterial hypothetical
protein (gi: 114706410 from Fulvimarina pelagi) with an
e-value of 6e-7 in the fourth iteration. The PSI-BLAST
search using this bacterial protein identified statistically
significant similarities to PAQR receptors and various bacterial hemolysins III (e.g. a human PAQR receptor (gi:
38018661) was found in the ninth iteration with an evalue of 1e-6 and a sequence identity of 13%). Similarly,
the homologous relationship between alkaline ceramidases
and the SID-1 family was supported by statistically significant hits through intermediate protein sequences (e.g. a
hypothetical protein from Nitrosomonas eutropha (gi:
114331832) was found by human ACER3 with an e-value
of 2e-6 in the seventh iteration, and it in turn found a sea
urchin SID-1 protein (gi: 115686293) with an e-value of
4e-06 in the third iteration). A PSI-BLAST search starting
with a bacterial hemolysin III (gi: 1708219 from Bacillus
cereus) found a TMEM8 protein (gi: 47227992 from Tetraodon nigroviridis) with an e-value of 9e-6 and a sequence
identity of 12% at the fourth iteration. Conversely,

transitive PSI-BLAST searches starting from TMEM8 proteins also found PAQRs and bacterial hemolysins III with
statistically significant e-values (less than 1e-4).
Using the sensitive profile-profile-based similarity
search method HHpred [17], we also identified the Per1
family to be distantly related to alkaline ceramidases. For
example, an HHpred search using the profile built from
the human alkaline ceramidase ACER3 (gi: 296439452)
against the Pfam profile database identified the Per1
family (Pfam: PF04080, alignment coverage: 54 to 265
out of 267 profile positions of PF04080, alignment
sequence identity: 17%) with a probability score of 98.3
and an e-value of 1e-4. HHpred searches also reinforced
other findings in PSI-BLAST searches. For example, the
HHpred search using the same alkaline ceramidase query
against the profile database of human proteome found a
human SID-1 protein (gi: 8923171, alignment coverage:
residues 472 to 812, sequence identity: 18%) with a probability score of 97.4 and an e-value of 0.028. Examination
of the PSI-BLAST and HHpred alignments revealed several motifs harboring conserved residues aligned between
members of these families (Figure 1, with motifs
described below), further supporting the proposed homologous relationships among them. Transitive PSI-BLAST
searches starting from members of the SID-1 family and
the Per1 family converged to closely related sequences
respectively, suggesting that each of them is distantly
related to the other families.
Additional support of homology among these families
was obtained by online CSI-BLAST [18] searches (e-value
inclusion cutoff 1e-4, against nr database). For example, a
CSI-BLAST search starting from the human alkaline ceramidase ACER3 found PAQR, TMEM8, SID-1 and Per1
family members with statistically significant e-values (less
than 1e-4).
Sequence groups of the CREST superfamily

We identified nearly 3000 CREST members from the
NCBI non-redundant database using transitive PSIBLAST searches starting from queries in alkaline ceramidase, PAQR, Per1, SID-1 and TMEM8 families (see Additional file 1 for the list of proteins). Clustering of the
transmembrane domains in these proteins by CLANS [19]
revealed eleven major sequence groups (Figure 2)
described below. A multiple sequence alignment of representative members of these groups is shown in Figure 1. It
covers three predicted core transmembrane segments with
putative active site residues (see Additional file 2 for an
alignment of all seven predicted core transmembrane
segments).
Alkaline ceramidases

Three types of ceramidases exist in mammalian genomes
and are classified according the the pH optima of their
catalytic activity [5]. Acid ceramidase resides in the

Figure 2 A sequence cluster diagram of CREST proteins. This
diagram is generated by the CLANS program on a non-redundant
set of CREST domains (see Methods). Protein domains are
represented as dots and the connections between them suggest
BLAST hits with p-values less than 1e-6. Eleven groups of proteins
are labeled. âHypo.â is the abbreviation for a hypothetical protein
group. Members from known families and hypothetical groups have
upper and lower triangle contours, respectively.

lysosome and its catalytic domain exhibits similarity to
members of the Ntn (N-terminal nucleophile)-hydrolases
[20]. Neutral ceramidase is a metal-dependent hydrolase
with a different structural fold [21]. The three copies of
alkaline ceramidases in mammalian genomes are transmembrane proteins located in the ER and Golgi that
have been indicated in intracellular sphingolipid regulation [5,22]. Close homologs of mammalian alkaline ceramidases form a tight group in the CLANS clustering
result (Figure 2). Alkaline ceramidases are populated in
other eukaryotic organisms, such as insects, fungi and
plants. Interestingly, alkaline ceramidases from both
fungi [23] and insects [24] have been shown to have a
negative effect on life span, suggesting that they are
potential targets in ageing studies.
Two distinct groups of PAQR receptors

Several members of the PAQR receptor family [25] have
been identified as putative receptors for progestin
[26,27] and the adipose-derived protein adiponectin
(also called adipoQ) [28]. Adiponectin and its receptors
are associated with a number of pathophysiological conditions including obesity and type 2 diabetes [29,30].
The CLANS sequence clustering revealed two distinct
groups in the large PAQR family (Figure 2) comprising
nearly 2,000 eukaryotic and bacterial proteins.
The first PAQR group consists of only eukaryotic proteins and includes the originally identified adiponectin
receptors in mammals [28] and the putative membranebound progestin receptors in fish [26] and their mammalian orthologs [31] (their subcellular localization and
function as progestin receptors have been controversial

Page 4 of 17

and under debate [27]). This group also includes members from fungi [32], plants [33] and various protists.
An expansion of this group occurs in many eukaryotic
species, e.g., the human genome has nine members and
the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has four
members (Izh1-4p, Figure 1), suggesting that these putative receptors can potentially accept a variety of ligands.
The four S. cerevisiae members have been shown to
play a role in zinc metabolism [32]. One of them
(Izh2p) was also shown to be involved in lipid and phosphate metabolism [34] and to inhibit the expression of a
gene involved in iron uptake [35].
The second PAQR group consists of bacterial and
eukaryotic proteins. The bacterial homologs are frequently
annotated as âhemolysin IIIâ, suggesting the role of a cytotoxin. A bacterial member from Bacillus cereus was shown
to be a pore-forming hemolysin [9]. The same activity was
demonstrated for a homolog from the Gram-negative
pathogen Vibrio vulnificus [36]. Members of this group
are widely distributed in various Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacterial phyla (see Additional file 1). The
STRING protein-protein interaction server [37] revealed
that some of the bacterial hemolysin III genes are neighbors to a gene encoding a hypothetical protein that contains a DegV domain (Pfam entry: PF02645) known to
bind fatty acids (e.g., gi: 81428574 from Lactobacillus sakei
found a DegV domain-containing protein LSA0964 with a
score of 0.752). For some other bacterial members, the
STRING server reported the gene neighborhood association with a DUF1836 domain-containing protein (e.g. gi:
157151576 from Streptococcus gordonii found a DUF1836
domain-containing hypothetical protein SGO_1308 with a
score of 0.877). DUF1836 is classified in the helix-turnhelix (HTH) clan in the Pfam database and could serve as
a transcriptional regulator for some of the bacterial hemolysins III. The two human proteins from the second group
(PAQR10 and PAQR11) are annotated as âmonocyte to
macrophage differentiation factorsâ [38] with limited
experimental studies [39]. Compared to the first PAQR
group, the second group has a more restricted distribution
in eukaryotes. This group has no plant members and the
only two species from fungi in this group belong to the
parasitic Microsporidia phylum.
The Per1 family

The Per1p protein in S. cerevisiae was originally identified as a suppressor of the cdc1 mutant [40] and was suggested to play a role in manganese homeostasis [41].
Later studies showed that Per1p and its mammalian
ortholog PGAP3 are involved in the lipid remodeling of
GPI-anchored proteins [10,11]. This remodeling process
involves the detachment of lipid chains from the intermediate GPI-anchored proteins and the reattachment of
new, usually saturated lipid chains, thus facilitating the
localization of GPI-anchored proteins to specialized

microdomains (âlipid raftsâ). Both the yeast Per1p and the
mammalian PGAP3 were shown to be required for the
hydrolysis of lipid moieties from GPI-anchored proteins.
Direct evidence of hydrolase activity in Per1p or PGAP3
is lacking. However, their homology relationship to alkaline ceramidase (which catalyzes a similar hydrolysis
reaction) and the conservation of similar residues (discussed below) together suggest that Per1p and PGAP3
are hydrolases. The Per1 family (Figure 2) comprises
about 150 closely related eukaryotic proteins mainly from
fungi, plants and metazoans.

EGF domain with six conserved cysteines (detected by
HHpred) and an unannotated N-terminal region.
TMEM8c proteins in vertebrates are single-domain proteins of about 220 amino acids. The conserved serine and
aspartic acid are absent in TMEM8c proteins (Figure 1),
possibly resulting in the loss of hydrolase activity.
Recently, several studies have indicated that human
TMEM8b (also named NGX6 for nasopharyngeal carcinoma associated gene 6) was down-regulated in several
cancer cell lines and may be a tumor suppressor [14,15].

The SID-1 family

In addition to the known protein groups, CLANS clustering revealed five groups of proteins of unknown function
often annotated as hypothetical proteins (Figures 1 and 2,
named hypothetical groups 1-5). Their relationships to the
known CREST groups were investigated by the phylogenetic reconstruction of the CREST sequences in Figure 1
using MOLPHY (see Methods). Consistent with the
CLANS grouping, each of the eleven groups in Figure 1
is monophyletic in the MOLPHY phylogenetic tree (Figure
3), generally with good statistical support (nine out of the
eleven groups with bootstrap percentage values above
80%). A similar tree generated by PhyML also supports
the separation of these groups (see Additional file 3).
Hypothetical group 1 consists of proteins from bacteria
and plants. One member in this group is SAG18 (gi:
15223970) from Arabidopsis thaliana, which was found
in a screen of senescence-associated genes [46]. The bacterial members of this group are mainly from Proteobacteria (see Additional file 1). Hypothetical group 2 consists
of only bacterial proteins. They are mainly from the
Alphaproteobacteria class (see Additional file 1). These
two hypothetical groups appear to be more closely
related to alkaline ceramidases (with a modest bootstrap
percentage value of 82% for grouping them with alkaline
ceramidases) than to the other known groups according
to the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3). Therefore, it would
be interesting to experimentally test the ceramidase activity for these hypothetical proteins. Proteins of hypothetical group 3 are from various protists of genera such as
Trypanosoma, Toxoplasma and Paramecium, as well as
from the Choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis. They
form a well-supported clade with the TMEM8 group
(Figure 3). Hypothetical groups 4 and 5 consist of proteins from green plants (Viridiplantae) and green algae
(Chlorophyta) respectively. Hypothetical group 5 and the
two PAQR groups form a well-supported clade, whereas
the relationship of hypothetical group 4 to the other
groups remains unclear (it clusters with the Per1 group
with a low bootstrap support value) (Figure 3).
The phylogenetic tree revealed two separate locations
of bacterial sequences (blue names in Figure 3). One
cluster of bacterial sequences (from hypothetical groups
1 and 2) are clustered with alkaline ceramidases from

The SID-1 protein from Caenorhabditis elegans was characterized as a transmembrane protein that facilitates double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) uptake and thus plays a key
role in the systematic RNAi response [12,13]. Its mammalian homologs were also implicated in the RNAi pathways
[42,43]. SID-1 members have a restricted distribution in
eukaryotes, as they are only found in metazoan species
and a few lower organisms such as Dictyostelium discoideum and Monosiga brevicollis. Mammalian genomes contain two closely related SID-1 homologs, while copy
number varies in insects (e.g., no copies in Drosophila melanogaster but up to three copies in Tribolium castaneum)
[44,45]. SID-1 proteins are usually long with more than
800 amino acids and have four additional predicted membrane segments in addition to the seven core membrane
segments (discussed below).
Lineage-specific expansion of the SID-1 family is
observed in C. elegans and Caenorhabditis briggsae, with
several divergent copies of SID-1-like proteins in both
genomes. In C. elegans, only the originally identified SID-1
protein and another SID-1-like protein tag-130 possess
the complete set of conserved residues (Figure 1), while
the other SID-1-like proteins could have lost the proposed
hydrolase activity. The SID-1-like protein tag-130 in
C. elegans exhibits higher sequence similarity to SID-1-like
proteins in mammals and insects than the originally identified C. elegans SID-1 protein. Experimental studies have
shown that unlike SID-1, tag-130 does not contribute to
systematic RNAi response in C. elegans [44] and its function remains to be investigated.
The TMEM8 family

The TMEM8 family proteins share a Pfam domain of
unknown function (DUF3522) corresponding to the
transmembrane region that is homologous to other
CREST members. They are present in metazoans and
plants. Vertebrate genomes have three copies of TMEM8
proteins (TMEM8a-c) while most insects only have one
copy. TMEM8a and TMEM8b in vertebrates, as well as
the TMEM8 family members in other metazoan species
and plants, are multi-domain proteins usually with more
than 400 amino acids. The transmembrane domains are
located at their C-termini. They also possess a divergent

eukaryotes, and the other cluster (bacterial hemolysins
III) is grouped with PAQRs from eukaryotes. Such a distribution suggests that at least two copies of CREST
members are present in the last common ancestor of
bacteria and eukaryotes. No CREST members were
found from archaeal organisms, likely reflecting the difference of membrane lipid composition of archaea from
bacteria and eukaryotes [47]. Alkaline ceramidase and
Per1 are hydrolases acting on the amide or ester bond
between the hydrophobic acyl group and the hydrophilic
head group (sphingosine or glycerol). However, ether
bond exists between the acyl group and the head group
of archaeal membrane lipids, in contrast to the ester or
amide bond in bacterial and eukaryotic membrane
lipids.
Domain architecture and sequence motifs of the CREST
superfamily

Members of the CREST superfamily share seven predicted
core transmembrane segments (Figure 4a). Some members
of the PAQRs, such as human progestin receptor a, have
an additional eighth predicted membrane segment at the
C-terminus (Figure 4b). The N- and C-terminal soluble
segments of most CREST members are generally short,
e.g., the N-terminus of the Per1 family proteins contains
an uncharacterized short sequence segment with several
conserved cysteines. The N-terminal segment in alkaline
ceramidase 2 (ACER2) were found to be indispensible for
its enzymatic activity [48]. A unique feature of the SID-1
family proteins is the presence of four more predicted
transmembrane segments in addition to the seven core
membrane segments. Two of the four additional predicted
transmembrane segments are located N-terminally to the
CREST domain. As SID-1 was proposed to be an RNA
transporter, these two additional predicted transmembrane segments could contribute to pore forming in the
membrane similar to ion-channel-linked receptors. The
other two additional predicted transmembrane segments
are inserted within the core CREST domain (Figure 4b).
They probably would not affect the topology of the core
structure and the active site placement if they form an upand-down helical hairpin commonly found in transmembrane proteins. Alternatively, they could be embedded
hydrophobic segments that do not span the lipid bilayer,
as indicated by the gene truncation experiment aimed at
determining the topology of SID-1 [13] (it should be noted
that truncation of a transmembrane protein could cause
structural changes or misfolding and lead to inconsistent
results, which were observed in some of the SID-1 truncations [13]). The additional membrane segments in SID-1
may contribute to structural stability or substrate gating
that is also found in intramembrane proteases [3]. Except
for some long bacterial hemolysin III proteins and the
EGF domain-containing TMEM8 members (Figure 4b),

Page 7 of 17

no other known domains were detected in CREST members. Signal peptides were predicted in Per1, SID-1 and
some TMEM8 family members.
Three conserved sequence motifs with semi-invariant
residues were identified in all CREST groups (Figure 1).
The first motif SxxxH (âxâ is any amino acid) is located at
the end of the second predicted core transmembrane segment. The second motif with a conserved aspartic acid is
located at the beginning of the third predicted core transmembrane segment. The third motif with two conserved
histidines (HxxxH) resides at the beginning of the
seventh predicted core transmembrane segment. We also
observed a conserved position comprising mainly small
residues in the sixth predicted core transmembrane segment (see Additional file 2). Topologically, the three
motifs are predicted to be located near the same side of
the membrane and thus may be proximal to each other
and form the putative active site (Figure 4a). The three
predicted core transmembrane segments (TM2, TM3
and TM7) harboring the motifs could also be spatially
close to each other (shown in Figure 4a). Coincidently, in
the seven-transmembrane GPCR structures [49], transmembrane segments 2, 3 and 7 are also spatially close
and interact with each other. We did not detect statistically significant sequence similarities between CREST
members and GPCRs. The set of CREST-specific
sequence motifs was not found in GPCRs, and GPCRs
have a different topology than PAQRs in the plasma
membrane (discussed below). Structure determination of
CREST members could help elucidate whether CREST
members exhibit a similar structural fold as GPCRs and
whether they are evolutionarily related to GPCRs.

Discussion
Cataloguing distantly related protein families into superfamilies helps understanding their evolution and deducing useful information about their structure and
function. Such a level of classification is used in protein
structure classification databases such as SCOP [50] and
CATH [51] (the superfamily level), the Pfam protein
families database [52] (the clan level), the MEROPS peptidase database [53] (the clan level), and in membrane
transporter classification [54] (the superfamily level). Distantly related protein families can result from gene duplication events followed by sequence and functional
divergence, or from accelerated evolution in certain evolutionary lineages. Although they can have different cellular functions and/or phylogenetic distributions,
distantly related protein families often share similar biochemical activities, exemplified by enzymes performing
similar reactions. The identities and placements of active
site residues responsible for their common biochemical
activities are usually conserved as well. Cross-referencing

information of distantly related protein families can shed
light on their function and help experimental design.
In this study, we unified five known protein families as
well as several groups of proteins with unknown function into a large and diverse superfamily of putative

transmembrane hydrolases comprising nearly 3000
sequences in the current sequence database. The statistically significant sequence similarities detected by multiple similarity search methods, together with shared
sequence motifs, support the homologous relationships

among members of the CREST superfamily. The most
striking feature of the CREST superfamily of transmembrane proteins is the large functional capacity revealed
by independent experimental studies of its members,
with diverse and seemingly unrelated functions of hormone receptors (PAQRs), bacterial hemolysins, dsRNA
transporters (SID-1) and putative tumor suppressers
(TMEM8). It also remains unclear how the putative
hydrolase activity contributes to these functions. The
hydrolase prediction could open new directions for the
future research of CREST members.
The hydrolase activity has been independently
assigned to the alkaline ceramidase family [5] and the
Per1 family [10,11]. They catalyze similar reactions on

Page 9 of 17

different substrates (Figure 5). Alkaline ceramidase
hydrolyzes the amide bond in ceramide to produce
sphingosine and a fatty acid. Per1 is responsible for the
phospholipase A2 activity that removes fatty acids in
GPI-anchored proteins. Human alkaline ceramidase 2
(ACER2), an enzyme residing in the membrane of the
Golgi apparatus, was shown to have its C-terminus in
the cytosol [48]. Such a topology positions its putative
active site residues (Figure 4a) near the lumen side of
the Golgi membrane (Figure 5). Therefore, the substrates and products of the catalysis would be within or
near the Golgi inner lipid layer (Figure 5). Likewise, the
ER membrane-located human alkaline ceramidase 1
(ACER1) [55] is predicted to have the same topology as

Figure 5 The topology and subcellular localization of four CREST proteins. Like in Figure 4a, TM7 is set as neighboring to TM2 and TM3 to
reflect possible spatial closeness between TM2, TM3 and TM7. Putative active site locations are marked by six-point stars. Alkaline ceramidases
and Per1/PGAP3 are located in the ER or the Golgi membrane with their C-termini in the cytosol. Alkaline ceramidases catalyze the hydrolysis of
ceramide to sphingosine. Per1/PGAP3 is required for phospholipase A2 activity that removes one of the two fatty acid chains (shown in
zigzagged shapes) from the GPI-anchored protein (labeled âG-A-Pâ). The chemical structures of ceramide and the GPI-anchored protein are shown
(R1 and R2 are two aliphatic chains; P, I and S in circles represent phosphate group, inositol group, and suger or other groups connecting to the
protein, respectively). The amide bond in ceramide hydrolyzed by alkaline ceramidase and the ester bond in the GPI-anchored protein
hydrolyzed by Per1/PGAP3 are indicated by downward arrows. Adiponectin receptors and SID-1 are located in the plasma membrane with their
N-termini in the cytosol. Adiponectin receptors interact with the extracellular hormone adiponectin (shown as a triangle) and may possess
ceramidase or other hydrolase activity (marked by a dotted arrow). The putative dsRNA transporter SID-1 may possess an unknown hydrolase
activity (marked by a question mark).

ACER2 [38]. Per1 is also located in the ER membrane
and has the same predicted topology with its C-terminus in the cytosol (Figure 5). Such a topology is consistent with the ER localization of Per1âs substrates, GPIanchored proteins (before they are delivered to the
plasma membrane), which are anchored to the inner
lipid layer of the ER membrane using fatty acids [56]
(Figure 5). The substrates of alkaline ceramidase and
Per1 have similar chemical structures in their lipid moieties with two aliphatic chains (Figure 5), suggesting
similar modes of substrate binding and catalytic
mechanisms.
Based on the inferred homologous relationship
between PAQRs and alkaline ceramidases, it has been
speculated that PAQRs could function as ceramidases
and generate sphingosine as a second messenger for
downstream signaling [7]. Although no direct evidence of
these receptors being hydrolases currently exist, experimental results showed that sphingolipids function as
downstream effectors of a PAQR member in yeast [7],
and that a ceramidase inhibitor can antagonize human
PAQRs [57]. Furthermore, a latest study showed that adiponectin can induce increased ceramidase activity and
this effect is associated with adiponectin receptors [8]. As
two of the CREST groups, alkaline ceramidase and Per1,
perform similar yet distinct hydrolysis reactions on different substrates, it is also possible that the substrates and
reaction products of the other CREST groups differ,
which could contribute to their functional diversity.
Therefore, the future experimental studies of PAQRs
should not be restricted to just the potential effects of
ceramidase activity. Other hydrolase activities on various
lipid molecules, especially the phospholipase A2 activity
(suggested for Per1), and their cellular effects can be
tested for PAQR members. The products of the phospholipase A2 activity on a phospholipid substrate are a lysophospholipid molecule and a free fatty acid [58], both of
which are potential precursors of second messengers that
could regulate downstream signaling events [59,60].
Classic seven-transmembrane GPCR receptors transduce signals across the plasma membrane and rely on a
separate effector protein (such as adenylate cyclase or
phospholipase C) to produce second messengers. Wellstudied enzyme-linked receptors, such as receptor tyrosine
kinases, receptor guanylate cyclases and histidine kinases,
are multi-domain proteins that have soluble domains in
the cytosol with enzymatic activities. If PAQRs do prove
to be receptors with hydrolase activity, they would represent a unique type of receptors that uses the enzymatic
activity in the transmembrane domain to generate second
messengers (such as sphingosine resulted from ceramidase
activity) or their precursors (such as lysophospholipid
molecules resulted from phospholipase A2 activity).
Further studies are required to determine if PAQRs

Page 10 of 17

possess intrinsic ceramidase or other hydrolase activity. A
recent genetic linkage analysis revealed that one single
nucleotide polymorphism (rs10920533) in human ADIPOR1 (the gene encoding adiponectin receptor 1) interacts
with plasma saturated fatty acids [61], indirectly supporting its role in lipid modification. Another interesting question is if and how the hydrolase activity can be modulated
by the binding of extracellular ligands such as adiponectin.
The second group of PAQRs includes bacterial hemolysins. Besides pore forming [9], these toxins could exert
their virulence through the putative hydrolase activity, e.g.,
by changing membrane lipid composition or generating
second messengers to modify signaling events in host cells.
In contrast to GPCR receptors, human adiponectin
receptors have an internal N-terminus and an extracellular C-terminus [28], thus positioning the conserved,
putative active site residues near the cytosol side of the
plasma membrane (Figure 5). The other human PAQR
members were also predicted to have their N-termini
residing in the cytosol (predictions made by Phobius
[38]). The C. elegans SID-1, also located in the plasma
membrane, adopts a topology similar to adiponectin
receptors with its N-terminus in the cytosol and its
putative active site near the inner lipid layer of the
plasma membrane [13] (Figure 5). SID-1 was proposed
to be a dsRNA transporter as its transfection to Drosophila (lacking an endogenic SID-1 ortholog) cells is sufficient to enable dsRNA uptake [13,62]. In this case,
SID-1 has the pore-forming ability similar to bacterial
hemolysins III. In a less likely scenario, SID-1 itself is
not a dsRNA transporter, but indirectly causes dsRNA
uptake by regulating the activity of a separate dsRNA
transporter [13]. The proposed hydrolase activity of
SID-1 could be involved in regulating its dsRNA transport ability, whether such a transport process is directly
or indirectly mediated by SID-1. It would also be interesting to test the hydrolase activity and its roles in the
TMEM8 family of putative tumor suppressors.
The specific roles of the conserved residues in CREST
proteins have not been reported, and the catalytic
mechanisms of alkaline ceramidases and Per1 are yet to
be determined. Mutational studies performed on yeast
Per1p [10] with the proposed phospholipase A2 activity
offer valuable information about the relative importance
of some conserved residues. Alanine mutation of either
the conserved histidine in the first motif (âSxxxHâ) or
the first conserved histidine in the third motif (âHxxxHâ)
abolished Per1p activity, suggesting that these histidines
are candidates of active site residues that directly contribute to catalysis. On the other hand, alanine mutation
of the conserved serine residue in the first motif (the
only serine conserved among all CREST groups), as well
as alanine mutations of several other residues that are
not conserved among all CREST groups, did not affect

Pei et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:37
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/37

Page 11 of 17

the activity of Per1p. Therefore, the proposed phospholipase A2 activity of Per1p is unlikely to have a serine
esterase-type mechanism that is utilized in certain
groups of soluble phospholipase A2 enzymes with an
a/b hydrolase fold [58]. Although the conserved serine
in the first motif may not directly involve in catalysis, it
could participate in hydrogen-bonding interactions with
an active site residue to help maintain its optimal orientation for metal-binding or catalysis. This serine appears
to be important for the activity of SID-1, as one of the
RNA interference-defective SID-1 mutants has a single
mutation of this serine to an isoleucine (see the supplemental Figure S3 in reference [12]).
Three histidines and one aspartate are conserved in
CREST proteins, reminiscent of the active site composition of several well-studied metal-dependent hydrolases
such as thermolysin [63], bovine carboxypeptidase A
[64], D-Ala-D-Ala carboxypeptidase [65] and the intramembrane S2P-like proteases [66]. These enzymes
adopt different structural folds, yet they all utilize histidines and negatively charged residues for their catalytic
activity (three residues used for metal binding and one
residue used for activating a metal-bound water molecule as the nucleophile to attack the scissile bond). The
presence of such a set of conserved residues in the
CREST superfamily and the mutational results of yeast
Per1p support the hypothesis that most CREST members are metal-dependent hydrolases. A large group of
secreted enzymes with phospholipase A2 activity (proposed for Per1p) are also metal-dependent hydrolases
with histidines in their active sites [58].

alkaline ceramidase protein ACER3 (NCBI gene identification (gi) number: 296439452) against the non-redundant
(nr) protein database (e-value inclusion cutoff: 1e-4, more
stringent than the default value in NCBI PSI-BLAST web
server (0.005)). To perform transitive searches, the protein
hits found by PSI-BLAST were grouped by BLASTCLUST
(with the score coverage threshold (-S, defined as the bit
score divided by alignment length) set to 1, length coverage threshold (-L) set to 0.5, and no requirement of length
coverage on both sequences (-b F)) and a representative
sequence from each group was used to initiate new PSIBLAST searches. The HHpred web server [17] was used
for profile-against-profile-based similarity searches using
several members found by PSI-BLAST against the Pfam
database [52] and the human proteome database with
default parameter settings. Newly identified human homologs were again subject to transitive PSI-BLAST searches.
Several CREST members were also submitted to the CSIBLAST server [18] (database: nr; e-value inclusion cutoff:
1e-4; maximum iteration number: 20) to further verify the
findings of PSI-BLAST and HHpred.

Conclusions
We inferred distant homologous relationships among five
transmembrane protein families (alkaline ceramidase,
PAQR, Per1, SID-1 and TMEM8) and several groups of
proteins with unknown function. Members of this superfamily share seven predicted core transmembrane segments and a set of conserved histidine and aspartate
residues. Such a conservation pattern coupled with
experimental evidence suggests that they are putative
metal-dependent hydrolases acting on molecules with
fatty acid moieties. It remains unclear how such putative
hydrolase activity contributes to the diverse and seemingly unrelated functions of hormone receptors, bacterial hemolysins, the SID-1 dsRNA transporters and the
TMEM8 putative tumor suppressers. Further experimental investigations could reveal new aspects of lipid biology
in the actions of these transmembrane proteins.

For sequence clustering, highly similar sequences were
removed at the 95% identity level by CD-HIT [69].
Sequence fragments with less than 100 residues were
removed. CLANS [19] was used to cluster the reduced
non-redundant set of domains based on pairwise BLAST
p-values. The clustering was run to equilibrium in a 2D
representation under default settings. Connections
between points (sequences) in the final diagram were set
by a BLAST P-value cutoff of 1e-6. For sequence alignment, representative CREST members in each group were
manually selected to sample sequences from diverse
organisms with emphasis on those that have been experimentally studied and described in this article. The multiple
sequence alignment of these representatives was made by
PROMALS that uses information of predicted secondary
structures and database homologs [70]. The alignment
was then improved by manual curation. The MOLPHY
package [71] was used for phylogenetic reconstruction
based on this alignment (positions with gap fractions larger than 0.1 were removed). The JTT amino acid substitution model [72] was used in MOLPHY. The local
estimates of bootstrap percentages were obtained by the

I have also several suggestions and questions.

would be helpful to provide a supplementary material

information like organism where it was found and
assignment to a family.

Reviewerâs report 1
Kira S. Markarova, National Center for Biotechnology
Information

We added a supplementary data file listing CREST proteins found by transitive PSI-BLAST searches. They are
grouped according to the CLANS clustering results and
have species information, definitions and html links to
their NCBI records.
2. There are a lot of bacterial proteins in CREST superfamily. For most of them no functional information is
available. Neighborhood analysis can provide some
insights (same âguilt by association approachâ as the analysis of domain fusions) into their function and point to the
potential functionally related gene families. Have you tried
to look into it? If not, it is worth checking and reporting.

This paper describes new superfamily of membrane proteins predicted to be metal-dependent hydrolases. Among
this superfamily there are several important eukaryotic
families that before were not recognized as being homologous. Generally this is a good paper with all conclusions
well-supported and justified. In my opinion, however, the
important message of the paper could be fit in a shorter
format, like, for example, the âDiscovery noteâ in Biology
Direct. For instance, the Results section of the paper
describing the support for unification of these families is
an âoverkillâ. It would be enough to briefly describe the
results of either PSI-BLAST or HHpred and mention that
other programs support them. The description of the
others work related to these families also could be briefer,
since not everything what was shown is related to this
work. There are other areas for omitting in family description and discussion, just because that they reiterate the
same information that is already present in the text
somewhere.
Authorsâ response

We considered other article types when preparing the
manuscript, but decided that the length (less than 1500
words) and figure number (no more than one figure or
table) limits of the discovery note format could not accommodate the complete contents of this work. In this revised
version, one more figure is added to make a total of five figures. We feel that the new figure showing the phylogenetic
tree is necessary since it provided additional information
about the relationships among the CREST groups and
helped address comments raised by all three reviewers.
Researchers can have different opinions on the necessity of
detailed description of similarity search results. For example, the third reviewer asked for more support from other
similarity search methods. We feel that providing details of
the similarity search results makes the descriptions scientifically more rigorous and would be appealing to audiences
who are interested in these details. We agree that some of
the cited works appeared to be not closely related to this
work. However, we still considered them worthwhile since
not much is known for many CREST groups and the limited existing literature could potentially be useful for cross
reference when new experimental data are available in the

Authorsâ response

We previously did try to find functional linkages of bacterial CREST members to other proteins using the STRING
functional association server, but did not include the
results since we did not obtain substantial information
regarding the functions of these proteins. One frequent top
hit of the gene neighborhood analysis reported by STRING
for bacterial hemolysins III is a hypothetical protein containing a domain of unknown function (DUF1836). Pfam
classified DUF1836 in the HTH (helix-turn-helix) clan,
which is also supported by HHpred searches of DUF1836
proteins. This linkage suggests that some bacterial hemolysins III are regulated by putative transcription factors
with DUF1836 domains. Another hit for some bacterial
hemolysins III is a DegV domain-containing protein
known to bind fatty acids. Bacterial hemolysin III genes
were also frequently linked to proteins with various enzymatic activities, such as methylases, glycosyltransferases
and phosphotransferases, mostly with marginal to medium scores (most of the scores examined were below 0.7,
which is considered to be a cutoff for high confidence associations in the STRING server). While possible associations with proteins having enzyme activities may suggest
that bacterial hemolysins III are also enzymes performing
concerted reactions along with other enzymes, we did not
obtain further definitive cellular function information
based on these associations. For the two groups of
hypothetical proteins with bacterial members, we also did
not find substantial functional information by the gene
association analysis using the STRING server. We added
the STRING gene association results linking bacterial
hemolysins III to DegV and DUF1836 in the revised
manuscript.

3. The CREST superfamily has two nice motifs: SxxxH
and HxxxH. Have you tried to apply motif search in
order to identify families with the same motifs but not
found by sequence similarity approach? Surprisingly this
approach still can be useful (as we recently showed for
FtsZ superfamily - PMID: 20459678). In any event it
would be interesting to know the outcome of this
search.
Authorsâ response

As the reviewer suggested, we searched the pattern
âSxxxHx(100,10000)HxxxHâ (the length in between the two
motifs was set to be 100 or above since they are separated
by five predicted core transmembrane segments) against
the nr database. Over 55000 sequences were found and
the majority of the hits appear to be not homologous to
CREST members according to our manual inspection (in
contrast, a search of the GGGTG(S/T)G motif characteristic of the FtsZ superfamily only retrieved about 7500 hits
from the nr database and the majority of them appeared
to be FtsZ homologs according to their annotations). Thus
we conclude that these two motifs (SxxxH and HxxxH)
themselves are not enough for characterization of the
CREST members. As these motifs lie within or near the
end of the predicted transmembrane segments (TMs, see
Figure 1), we devised a new search strategy that takes into
account their relative positioning in predicted TMs. The
following steps were conducted: (1). Predict the TMs using
Phobius for a target protein set. (2). For each protein in
the set, analyze the motif patterns for its predicted TMs
in the following way. For each predicted TM defined by
the starting position i and the ending position j, search for
the pattern SxxxH in the range [(i+j)/2, j+5] (corresponding to the C-terminal half of the TM plus 5 residues
C-terminal to the TM). Search for the pattern HxxxH in
the range [i-5, (i+j)/2] (corresponding to the N-terminal
half of the predicted TM plus 5 residues N-terminal to
the predicted TM). (3). A positive motif match is reported
if SxxxH and HxxxH are found in two separate predicted
TMs under the conditions that SxxxH is N-terminal to
HxxxH and they are at least 3 predicted TMs apart from
each other (SxxxH is in core TM2 and HxxxH is in core
TM7 in Figure 1, so they should be at least 5 TMs apart
(SID-1 has an additional pair of TMs in between), but to
correct for potential missing TMs by the prediction program, this number is relaxed to 3 predicted TMs apart).
We applied this strategy to a number of eukaryote proteomes (human, fruit fly, budding yeast and Arabidopsis
thaliana) and about 1100 prokaryotic proteomes downloaded from the NCBI ftp site. The results were clustered
by BLASTCLUST and each cluster was manually
checked. We did not find new candidates of CREST
members.
4. What is your opinion on the origin of CREST
family? Could the ancestor be placed in LUCA and if

Page 13 of 17

yes, are there any ideas, on its ancestral function. Have
you noticed any representatives of CREST family in
archaea?
Authorsâ response

We built a phylogenetic tree using MOLPHY for the eleven groups of representative sequences shown in Figure 1.
According to this tree, there are two separate groups of
bacterial proteins associated with eukaryotic alkaline
ceramidases and PAQR receptors, respectively. We thus
proposed in the revised manuscript that there might be
at least two copies of CREST members in the last common ancestor of eukaryotes and bacteria. We did not
find members of the CREST superfamily in archaea. We
proposed in the revised manuscript that the lack of
CREST members in archaea is likely related to the difference of archaeal membrane lipid composition from those
of the bacteria and eukaryotes. CREST members such as
alkaline ceramidase and Per1 are proposed to hydrolyze
the amide or ester bond between the hydrophobic acyl
group and the hydrophilic head group (sphingosine or
glycerol). However, in archaea, such amide and ester
bonds are replaced by the ether bonds in membrane
lipids. Therefore, the reactions catalyzed by CREST
members may not be useful in archaea.
Reviewerâs report 2
Igor B. Zhulin, University of Tennessee at Knoxville

The paper by Pei et al. describes a superfamily of putative transmembrane hydrolases, which includes more
than 3000 proteins from eukaryotes and prokaryotes.
From the technical point of view, this is a very well executed study. All relationships between protein sequences
were established using careful analysis. I have two problems with this paper:
1. The novelty is rather marginal. A relationship
between eukaryotic PAQR proteins and bacterial
hemolysin-type proteins has been captured in the Pfam
HlyIII family (PF03006), which includes more than
2000 transmembrane proteins. Current work does
expand this family into a superfamily by essentially
combining it with other Pfam families, such as Ceramidase (PF05875), and DUF3522 (PF12036) and also
identifies several novel families within this superfamily.
This is definitely a finding, but it does not sound too
exciting. Authors postulate that âCataloguing distantly
related protein families into superfamilies helps understanding their evolution and deducing useful information about their structure and functionâ. I agree, but
this work does not suggest too much about the evolution of this superfamily and useful information about
function is rather limited. It appears to me that the
most useful information is the identification of conserved residues that suggest the hydrolase activity something, which is testable experimentally.

Pei et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:37
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/37

Authorsâ response

We agree that limited functional information was
inferred for CREST groups, which is characterized by a
diverse functional capacity. To obtain more evolutionary
information, we used phylogenetic reconstruction to
investigate the relationships between the eleven CREST
groups. The phylogenetic trees built by MOLPHY and
PhyML were added in the revised manuscript.
2. More serious concern is that no actual data is provided other than some examples. I understand that there
are more than 3000 protein sequences, but there must be
some way of presenting it. Figure 1 shows a representative
alignment of less than 60 sequences. As for the rest, we
have to take authorsâ word for it. Providing the actual data
(as a supplementary file, I suppose) is especially important
in this case, because (i) cataloguing is the whole purpose
of this work (but âthe full catalogâ is missing, weâve got
only âthe advertisement with âbest buyâ itemsâ), and (ii) in
the absence of a model deposited to a public resource (e.g.
Pfam) this is the only way for biologists to obtain this
information. I think both of these concerns can be easily
addressed by placing more emphasis on novelty and
potential impact and by providing data.
Authorsâ response

In the revised manuscript, we provided supplementary
data listing the eleven groups of CREST proteins found by
transitive PSI-BLAST searches. Besides the linking of various known protein families and hypothetical groups in the
CREST superfamily and the identification of the conserved
and potential active site residues, we feel that one novel
aspect of this work lies in the discovery of a diverse array of
cellular functions that this superfamily encompasses. While
the alkaline ceramidase and Per1 were proposed to possess
hydrolase activities in ceramide or GPI-anchored protein
biosynthesis pathways, it is quite interesting how such
putative hydrolase activity contributes to the diverse and
seemingly unrelated functions of hormone receptors, bacterial hemolysins, the SID1 dsRNA transporters and the
TMEM8 putative tumor suppressers. The hydrolase prediction can potentially provide new directions in the future
experimental studies of these proteins. We proposed that
PAQRs could represent a novel type of receptors that use
their transmembrane domains to generate second messengers. We also suggested that the experimental work on
these receptors should not be restricted to testing the ceramidase activity, as CREST members can catalyze different
reactions exemplified by alkaline ceramidases and Per1.
We emphasized these points in the discussion and conclusions of the revised manuscript.
Reviewerâs report 3
Rob Knight, University of Colorado at Boulder

In this manuscript, the authors unite several families of
putative transmembrane hydrolases into one superfamily

Page 14 of 17

using similarity search methods, specifically iterated PSIBLAST. The superfamily contains several protein families
of unknown function, providing a clear hypothesis concerning the function of these new members (although no
experimental data are provided for validation). Overall,
the paper is competently written and executed, though
not especially groundbreaking. One puzzle is that the
authors use iterated PSI-BLAST rather than profile-profile techniques such as COMPASS, which might be
worth commenting on as the same group has previously
argued that profile-profile methods provide substantially
better results than sequence-profile matching, especially
for detecting similarities in highly diverged protein
families. The technique is also similar to the Shotgun
algorithm from Patsy Babbittâs lab and implemented in
some of our own software, which the authors might consider citing (although the approach is straightforward
and has likely been independently invented many times).
Authorsâ response

For similarity searches, we used HHpred, a profile-profilebased method similar to COMPASS, but with the predicted secondary structure in its scoring to obtain better
sensitivity. Transitive PSI-BLAST searches were still used
since (1) they helped linking most of the groups with statistical support; (2) they enabled exhaustive search for
members of the CREST superfamily in the NCBI nonredundant sequence database (nr). No profile-profile based
searches on the nr database currently exist as far as we
know, possibly due to the time-consuming nature of such
searches. We submitted some CREST members to the
COMPASS web server http://prodata.swmed.edu/compass. Using the alkaline ceramidase ACER3 from human
as a query against the Pfam 23.0 database, COMPASS
did identify Hemolysin III (e-value: 8.05e-13) as the third
best hit and Per1 (e-value: 2.94e-06) among the top 20
hits. However, most of the top 20 hits with statistically significant e-values (less than 1e-4), such as Herpes_LMP1
and Macoilin, appear to be false positives as they do not
possess the conserved motifs unique to the CREST superfamily. A COMPASS search using yeast Per1p as the
query also retrieved many false positives as significant
hits. These results reflect possible issues with the profiles
of membrane proteins on which COMPASS has not been
extensively tested. We thus did not include the COMPASS
results in the manuscript.
It would be interesting to compare an explicit phylogenetic tree with the clans output shown in Figure 1.
Doug Theobald, now at Brandeis, developed a method
for converting COMPASS profile-profile significance
scores into a phylogenetic tree (PMID 16266719) which
it might be interesting to use here.
Authorsâ response

As the COMPASS results of several CREST members frequently included false positives among the top hits, we

Pei et al. Biology Direct 2011, 6:37
http://www.biology-direct.com/content/6/1/37

Page 15 of 17

chose not to use the method suggested by the reviewer. We
instead added the phylogenetic analysis of CREST members by MOLPHY, a frequently used tree reconstruction
method based on maximum likelihood. The tree reported
by MOLPHY is consistent with the CLANS grouping and
provided more information about the positioning of the
hypothetical groups relative to the known groups. We
added the phylogenetic analysis results in the revised
manuscript. We also provided the phylogenetic tree reconstructed by another program PhyML in the supplementary
data.
The discussion of the relationships among protein
families and conclusions generally seem appropriate,
and the manuscript should be a useful contribution to
the literature, especially if specific experimental tests
could be proposed that would confirm the function of
the unknown protein families and if the results could be
confirmed with the additional methods suggested above.

In the revised manuscript, we proposed to test the ceramidase activity for hypothetical groups 1 and 2 since
they are more closely related to alkaline ceramidases
than to the other known groups. Since two of the CREST
groups, alkaline ceramidase and Per1, catalyze similar
yet distinct reactions on different substrates, we reason
that the substrates for the other CREST groups, such as
PAQRs, could also differ. We thus proposed in the
revised manuscript that experimental studies of PAQRs
should not be restricted to just the ceramidase activity.
Other potential lipid hydrolase activities should also be
considered. Specifically, we proposed in the revised
manuscript that the phospholipase A2 activity (previously suggested for Per1) could be tested. The reaction
products (a lysophospholipid molecule and a free fatty
acid) of the phospholipase A2 activity on a phospholipid
substrate can be precursors of second messengers that
could function in PAQR signaling.
