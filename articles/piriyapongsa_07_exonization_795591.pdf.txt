Abstract
Background: Retrotransposons have been shown to contribute to evolution of both structure
and regulation of protein coding genes. It has been postulated that the primary mechanism by which
retrotransposons contribute to structural gene evolution is through insertion into an intron or a
gene flanking region, and subsequent incorporation into an exon.
Results: We found that Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) retrotransposons are associated with 1,057
human genes (5.8%). In 256 cases LTR retrotransposons were observed in protein-coding regions,
while 50 distinct protein coding exons in 45 genes were comprised exclusively of LTR
RetroTransposon Sequence (LRTS). We go on to reconstruct the evolutionary history of an
alternatively spliced exon of the Interleukin 22 receptor, alpha 2 gene (IL22RA2) derived from a
sequence of retrotransposon of the Mammalian apparent LTR retrotransposons (MaLR) family.
Sequencing and analysis of the homologous regions of genomes of several primates indicate that
the LTR retrotransposon was inserted into the IL22RA2 gene at least prior to the divergence of
Apes and Old World monkeys from a common ancestor (~25 MYA). We hypothesize that the
recruitment of the part of LTR as a novel exon in great ape species occurred prior to the
divergence of orangutans and humans from a common ancestor (~14 MYA) as a result of a single
mutation in the proto-splice site.
Conclusion: Our analysis of LRTS exonization events has shown that the patterns of LRTS
distribution in human exons support the hypothesis that LRTS played a significant role in human
gene evolution by providing cis-regulatory sequences; direct incorporation of LTR sequences into
protein coding regions was observed less frequently. Combination of computational and
experimental approaches used for tracing the history of the LTR exonization process of IL22RA2
gene presents a promising strategy that could facilitate further studies of transposon initiated gene
evolution.

Background
Retrotransposon sequences comprise more than 40 % of
the human genome [1,2]. Once dismissed as "junk DNA"
of little or no adaptive significance [3,4], retrotransposons
and other classes of transposable elements (TEs) are now
generally considered as significant contributors to gene
and genome evolution [5-9]. Of particular interest has
been the ability of TEs to contribute to exon evolution by
"exonization", i.e., an insertion of a TE into an intron and
subsequent recruitment of this sequence or its part into a
new protein-coding exon [10]. For example, it has been
estimated that 5% of all alternatively spliced human
exons had been derived from the exonization of Alu elements [11-13].
LTR transposable elements comprise nearly one-tenth of
the human genome and have been implicated in the cisregulatory evolution of a number of human genes [5,6,1418]. The structure of a complete LTR retrotransposon
(autonomous mobile element) comprises two copies of
long terminal directed repeats (LTRs) flanking an internal
region containing gag and pol genes, which encode a protease, reverse transcriptase, RNase H and integrase. These
protein products are necessary for the formation of viruslike particles (VLPs) wherein replication of the element
takes place. Some elements evolved from retroviruses
have additional open reading frames (ORFs), e.g. env gene
[1,19]. Flanking LTRs contain all the necessary transcriptional regulatory elements.
Although global database screens have been conducted to
examine the contribution of TEs to human protein-coding
regions [10,20,21], none have concentrated specifically
on the prevalence of the LRTS-derived protein-coding
exons of human genes. Here we report the results of computational analysis of the LRTS exonization in human
genome. Also we describe the plausible scenario of the
exonization process of an alternatively spliced exon of the
alpha 2 gene of the Interleukin 22 receptor (IL22RA2)
supported by new experimental data.

Results and Discussion
Updated list of LRTS-associated genes
To identify incidences of LRTS exonization, the annotation of human exons given in the UCSC genome browser
was compared with the annotation of transposable elements available in the same source. We detected LRTS
associations in 1,057 out of 18,241 genes (5.8 %). These
associations include 1,249 distinct exons participating in
1,287 transcripts (note that a particular exon is counted
once though it may participate in several alternative transcripts). It was reported earlier [10] that 130 out of 13,799
human genes (0.9 %) were found to contain LRTS in protein coding regions. In comparison, in our data set
(18,241 genes/23,821 transcripts) we observed LRTS asso-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/291

ciations with protein-coding exons in 256 genes (1.4 %).
Current LRTS search done at the DNA instead of mRNA
level helped detect several short LRTS-exon overlaps that
could be missed at mRNA level. Interestingly, only 53 of
the previously reported 130 cases were found in current
analysis using the updated RefSeq gene data. Many previously identified cases (61 cases) did not show up in our
data set as the earlier sequences were removed, suppressed, or replaced. Several cases appear to be possible
false positives. In one case, LRTS was detected in UTR
instead of in CDS. No LRTS was detected in other two
cases when the RepeatMasker program was run separately
on each mRNA sequence using its specific G+C content,
which gives a slightly more accurate result, as opposed to
input of multiple sequences with averaged G+C content
used in the program [22].
Distribution of LRTS in human exons
We found that human gene exons (either protein-coding
or non-coding) overlap with LTR flanks of LTR elements
more frequently (1,074 cases) than with internal
sequences (242 cases; note that exons overlaped with
both regions were counted twice). This observation could
be related to the fact that most (85%) of the LTR retroposon-derived sequences in human genome consist only of
a solo LTR, with the internal sequence lost due to homologous recombination between the flanking LTRs [1].
Upon checking by BLASTX of 242 exons overlapping with
the internal sequences, 61 exons were found to contain a
section or even a whole viral gene (i.e. gag, pol, and env).
However, only 20 of these 61 exons were protein-coding
exons. Moreover, only in 10 cases was the reading frame
of a human gene the same as the one of the viral gene.
Seven out of these ten cases were observed in hypothetical
genes. The remaining three cases represented a gene for
endogenous retroviral protein, syncytin (ERVWE1), a
gene for Krueppel-related zinc finger protein(H-plk) and a
placenta-specific gene (PLAC4) which protein products
contain the envelope, envelope and gag viral protein
domain, respectively. All three genes are preferentially
expressed in the placenta [23-25]. This observation indicates that the invasion of the Human Endogenous Retrovirus (HERV) may contribute to molecular mechanisms
involved in human reproduction [26].

The majority of exons overlapping with LRTS (1,123 of
1,249) contain sequences homologous to only one LRTS.
Exons overlapping with more than one LRTS were
observed as well (Table 1). Overall, we have found 1,395
associations (overlaps) between an LRTS and an exonic
sequence. These 1,395 observations were classified further
according to the extent of LRTS overlap with an exon
(Table 2), type of exon (Table 3), and LRTS class/family
(Table 4). The majority of LRTS associations with genes
(586/1395 or 42 %) constitute an apparent extension of

original exon due to activation of alternative splice site
located inside LRTS. On the other hand, in 22.9% (319/
1395) of these associations LRTS was recruited as an
entirely novel exon (Table 2).
Regarding the distribution of LRTS within a complete
gene structure (5'UTR, first CDS exon, internal protein
coding exons, last CDS exon, 3'UTR), the LRTS fragments
were found in untranslated regions (UTRs), mainly in
3'UTRs, much more frequently than in protein-coding
(CDS) regions. This observation is consistent with the previous study [27] and indicates the putative role of LRTS in
resident gene regulation by providing sequence material
for emerging regulatory sequences [6,17]. In comparison,
insertion of LRTS in a protein coding region may interfere
with gene function, and in many cases such a modification is likely to be eliminated by negative selection. Note
that an LRTS was found more frequently in the last CDS
exon, especially in the exon untranslated region, and less
frequently in internal coding exons (Table 3).
LRTS-derived protein coding exons
We have found 50 protein coding exons completely
derived from LRTS (41 internal, 2 initial, 4 terminal coding exons and 3 single coding exons, see additional file 1:
suppl_table_1.pdf for details). Most of LRTS-derived
exons (36/50) were comprised exclusively of LTR flanking
regions. Eleven exons were derived from LTR element
internal sequences and 3 exons contained both types of
regions. Of the 50 exons, 38 were components of well
characterized protein coding genes (i.e., genes with the
corresponding mRNAs available in GenBank and with
encoded proteins listed in SWISS-PROT, TrEMBL, and
TrEMBL-NEW).

The low frequency of protein coding exons fully derived
from LRTS indicates that the chance of a successful recruitment of a whole coding exon from the LTR transposable
element is rather small. The exonization of originally
intronic LRTS requires the presence of a pair of potential
splice sites, enclosing a sequence with no stop codon in

the appropriate reading frame. Also, the amino acids contributed by a mobile element should not disrupt the structure of a protein encoded by the original gene,
particularly, the addition of a new exon should not
change the coding frame for the remaining part of a gene.
Interestingly, most of the protein coding exons derived
entirely from the LTR flanking regions originated from the
MaLR family (24 out of 36). This could be explained by
several factors. First of all, MaLR elements make up about
50% of the LTR retroelements in the human genome [1],
and this high frequency alone may relate to their overrepresentation in protein coding exons. MaLRs are also relatively ancient elements, which have probably been
exposed to more opportunities for exonizations over time.
Note that the age factor has been implicated for proliferation of Alu-derived exons as well [12]. Finally, it is a formal possibility that nucleotide sequences of the MaLR
family are better amenable for derivation of protein coding exons.
The internal sequence of MaLR is rarely found retained in
the human genomic sequence [28]. Particularly, among
exons derived from the internal parts of LRTS only one
was from the MaLR family.
Contribution of LRTS to gene transcripts
We further analyzed the abundance of LRTS-derived exons
in gene transcripts. Most of the 275 genes containing at
least one exon completely derived from LRTS (201 out of
275) are single transcript genes while the remaining 74
generate more than one transcript per gene. Note that
about 60% (121/201) of single transcript genes encode
zinc finger proteins (25%) or hypothetical proteins
(35%). Apparently for the single transcript gene the LRTS
insertion either has not disrupted the host gene function
or possibly provided some beneficial modulation of the
initial function and thus has been tolerated by natural
selection.

In 55 out of 74 genes (74.3%) with multiple transcripts,
LRTS-derived exons were present in some transcript variTable 2: The distribution of the extent of overlap between an

ants, but not in all of them. This observation corresponds
to the scenario whereby recruiting of LRTS into alternatively spliced exon allows the main transcript to maintain
the function while the LRTS-associated exons are "examined" by natural selection, which may lead to emergence
of transcripts with new functions.

scripts of the IL22RA2 human gene encoding three protein variants (263, 231 and 130 amino acids in length)
have been described earlier [30]. The longest transcript
(variant 1) is generated (Fig. 1) by addition of the 96 nt
exon (exon 3/4) to splice variant 2 between exon 3 and
exon 4 [30,31,33].

We also found that most of the LRTS-derived protein coding exons (48/50) were either alternatively spliced ones or
the components of single transcript genes. In contrast,
most of LRTS derived constitutive exons (those that are
present in all alternative transcripts) are found in 5'UTR
sequences. This observation indicates that novel cis-regulatory sequences supplied by LTR elements to human
genes are more likely to be fixed in evolution than
sequences supplying protein coding domain which are
used as alternative ways to create protein variability.

In the current study, we provide experimental data and
computational analysis that show evolutionary evidence
of exonization of LRTS invaded the human IL22RA2 gene.
The exon 3/4 of the IL22RA2 gene (transcript variant 1) is
situated within the LTR sequence of MSTB2 subfamily of
MaLR family (found in the same orientation as the coding
sequence (Fig. 1)). The sequence alignment of the particular LTR and the MSTB2 LTR consensus sequence shows
82.8 % identity (for ungapped part of the 431 nt long
alignment). The exon 3/4 contributes 32 amino acids to
the IL22RA2 protein product without changing reading
frame for the rest of the protein. A homologous exon was
not found either in the mouse or in the rat orthologous
gene. Weiss et al. 2004 [29] also indicated that a counterpart of this exon was absent in mouse and rat. The functionality of the LTR exonization is corroborated by the
existence of the mRNA sequences containing the exon 3/
4 [RefSeq:NM_052962, GenBank:AY040567, AY358737,
EMBL:AJ313162]. The data available at the UCSC genome
browser show that the MSTB2 derived sequence is conserved in chimpanzee and rhesus monkey while is absent
in other vertebrates. To extract the sequences homologous
to the exon 3/4 in seven primates: human, chimpanzee,
bonobo, gorilla, orangutan, crab-eating macaque and rhesus monkey, we have performed the PCRs with human
DNA derived primers (see methods), which generated
well interpretable PCR products for all species (Fig. 2). We
used newly determined PCR product sequences as well as
publicly available genomic sequences of human, chimpanzee and rhesus monkey to construct the multiple
sequence alignment. We observed that the splice sites

Reconstruction of evolution of IL22RA2 gene (transcript
variant 1)
The IL22RA2 gene has an internal protein coding exon
derived from an LTR flanking sequence. This gene encodes
the only soluble receptor [29] in the class II cytokine
receptor family (CRF2). IL22RA2 protein specifically
binds to interleukin 22 (IL22) and by preventing the interaction of IL22 with its cell surface receptor, neutralizes
IL22 activity [30-32]. Three alternatively spliced tranTable 4: The distribution of class/family of LRTS containing in an

macaque and the rhesus monkey followed the GT/AG
rule. In the other two species, we observed AT instead of
GT at the donor site (Fig. 3). Therefore, emergence of this
exon was likely to occur in ape lineage earlier than the
divergence of orangutans and humans (Fig. 4). This event
was mediated by the single transition from A to G yielding
canonical donor splice site consensus. Note that AT (or GT
in other cases) is positioned in the predicted LTR polyadenylation site AATAAA (Fig. 3). Contrary to the acceptor
site, the strength of the donor site depends on the presence of just a few specific nucleotides around GT consensus. Therefore, a single mutation might create a functional
donor splice site. The canonical dinucleotide (AG) of the
acceptor site appeared in all primates we have studied.
However, this dinucleotide is different from dinucleotide
(GC) situated in the same position in MSTB2 consensus
sequence (Fig. 3). One possibility is that the mutation of
GC to AG could happen earlier in the primate lineage.
However, the sequence logo generated from the multiple
sequence alignment of the 880 MSTB2 sequences existing
in the human genome shows low degree of conservation
in the vicinity of acceptor site. Therefore, the dinucleotide
predecessor of AG should not necessarily be the consensus
GC dinucleotide.
Several coincidences must have been involved in creation
of the exon 3/4. The viable structural elements of the
splice sites (GT/AG) were created by mutations. With the

upstream intron in phase 2, the exon 3/4 emerged in the
frame which had no stop codons inside, while the other
two possible phases of intron would cause premature termination of translation. The new exon 3/4 (with length
divisible by three) did not disrupt the global reading
frame and therefore did not change the downstream
amino acid sequence known to be important for ligand
binding [33]. Our findings show that the exon 3/4 of
IL22RA2 might be active and be expressed in the Great
Apes, while we have not confirmed its expression in the
Old World monkeys. This observation indicates that the
exon 3/4 is likely to possess functional properties and it is
an alternatively spliced exon. We have evaluated the possibility that the exon 3/4 is the subject for positive selection by the standard test based on non-synonymous Ka to
synonymous Ks divergence rates ratio. There are three
nonsynonymous substitutions between human and orangutan homologous exonic sequences, while there are no
synonymous substitutions. The use of the Laplace pseudocounts produces (Ka+1)/(Ks+1) > 1, which indicates possible positive selection.
To date, very little is known about the role and the origin
of this additional exon (exon 3/4) in transcript variant 1.
Being the only CRF2 protein with 32 amino acids inserted
adjacent to the region important for ligand recognition,
this isoform may bind to structurally different ligands

than other isoforms [33]. This possibility is supported by
the experimental data which show that this variant fails to
block IL22 activity [31]. The longer MaLR-related isoform
may also modulate tissue-specific expression. The available data show that the IL22RA2 isoform 1 is expressed
only in placenta while isoform 2 is highly expressed in
placenta and mammary gland and at a lower level in
spleen, skin, thymus and stomach [33]. However, nothing
is known about the factors that control the expression of
this longest IL22RA2 variant. Additional experiments
should be performed to determine its function as well as
to identify the possible change in ligand specificity due to
the LTR-derived protein modification.

Conclusion
The distribution of LTR elements that became parts of
human protein-coding genes shows the distinct preference of LRTS fixation in 5' and 3'untranslated regions.
These observations confirm existing concept of LRTS role
as a contributor to gene regulation evolution. On the
other hand, the recruitment of LRTS to encode a part of a
protein domain leading the exaptation to evolution of the

host gene is a less frequent event. As shown in the part of
this paper related to evolution of IL22RA2 gene, several
coincidences are necessary to allow the LRTS exonization
event. The evolutionary analysis elucidates the action of
the mechanism of incorporation of LRTS into a novel
alternatively spliced exon.

Methods
Bioinformatic analysis
The refGene file (hg17, May2004) with data on 18,241
RefSeq human genes (genes on chr_random excluded)
including alternatively spliced variants (23,821 transcripts
in total) was retrieved from the UCSC genome browser
[34]. The annotations of 254,542 exons were compared
with the transposable elements annotations available in
the same database to determine the frequency of the LTR
elements in the exon regions. The descriptions of the LTR
elements were provided in the Repbase update (Repbase
release 8.12) [35]. We detected exon overlaps with the LTR
flanking regions and/or the internal sequences of LTR elements. The overlaps with exons were labeled as complete
(LRTS covers the whole exon), partial (LRTS partially overlap with exon), or inside overlap (LRTS completely inside
the exon). The type of exons associated with LRTS were
then classified as the first CDS exon (first exon containing
coding sequence), the last CDS exon (last exon containing
coding sequence), single protein coding exon (exon containing the whole CDS of a gene), 5'UTR exon (exon
located upstream to the first CDS exon/single protein coding exon) and 3'UTR exon (exon located downstream
from the last CDS exon/single protein coding exon), and
internal protein coding exon (all other CDS exons). In
cases of the first and last CDS exons as well as single protein coding exons, LRTSs could be inserted in either the
UTR and/or the CDS region. Finally, all the initial results
(see additional file 2: suppl_table_2.xls) were further
processed. Exons identical in different transcripts were
clustered to remove the redundancy. The LRTS fragments
were reconstructed manually based on the initial data
(e.g., LRTS family, human genome coordinates) and the
LRTS information available in Repbase [35].

For all genes containing LRTS-derived exons, we used data
of the Entrez gene and UCSC genome browser to infer
information on alternative transcripts containing LRTS
derived exons. Additionally, we checked the consistency
of the reading frames in the exon overlaps with internal
sequences of LRTS. The internal sequences of the LTR elements overlapping with CDS regions were translated in six
reading frames and searched by BLAST and Pfam for the
presence of domains of common viral proteins (gag, pro,
RT, RNaseH, IN and env). The cases when detected viral
protein domains became parts of human proteins were
registered.

Given that the first and last CDS exons are commonly less
reliably identified than the internal coding exons, we have
considered further only 41 internal coding exons completely covered with LRTS. We have chosen exon 3/4 of
the IL22RA2 gene (splice variant 1) for in depth study

The primers flanking the target LTR-derived sequence
were designed to be specific to the conserved humanchimpanzee-rhesus monkey region (data from the UCSC
genome browser) using the PRIMER3 program [36].
Sequences of PCR fragments were aligned by the ClustalW
program with default parameters [37] and then were manually adjusted. For human, chimpanzee, and rhesus monkey, the annotated sequences of regions in question were
previously available. In these three cases the known annotated sequences were used in the alignment while the PCR
data were utilized as a complementary information. The
donor-acceptor sites of the target exon were marked for all
sequences based on the corresponding positions in the
human IL22RA2. The timing of the exonization event was
estimated via the phylogenetic analysis.

The PCR amplifications of genomic DNA of seven primate
species (Homo sapiens, Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Gorilla

and a reverse primer 3'-TCAGGTATTCTGGGGTCTG-5',
which yield a 792 bp amplicon covering the region of the
LTR in human. The PCR cycle conditions were as follows:
initial 4 min and 30 sec pre-denaturation at 94°C, 30
cycles of 30 sec denaturation at 94°C, 30 sec annealing at
50°C, 1 min elongation at 72°C, and a final 1-cycle extension of 7 min at 72°C. The PCR products were then purified on 1% (w/v) agarose gel, Gibco BRL Ultra-Pure,
visualized by ethidium bromide staining and extracted by
using the gel extraction kit (QIAGEN). Direct sequencing
of the PCR products was performed by the DNA Sequencing Services, of the Genomics Core Facility at the Georgia
Institute of Technology.
