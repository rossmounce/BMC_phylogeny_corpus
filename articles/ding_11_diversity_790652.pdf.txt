Diversity and selective sweep in the OsAMT1;1
genomic region of rice
Zehong Ding1, Chongrong Wang1, Sheng Chen2, Sibin Yu1*

Abstract
Background: Ammonium is one of the major forms in which nitrogen is available for plant growth. OsAMT1;1 is a
high-affinity ammonium transporter in rice (Oryza sativa L.), responsible for ammonium uptake at low nitrogen
concentration. The expression pattern of the gene has been reported. However, variations in its nucleotides and
the evolutionary pathway of its descent from wild progenitors are yet to be elucidated. In this study, nucleotide
diversity of the gene OsAMT1;1 and the diversity pattern of seven gene fragments spanning a genomic region
approximately 150 kb long surrounding the gene were surveyed by sequencing a panel of 216 rice accessions
including both cultivated rice and wild relatives.
Results: Nucleotide polymorphism (Pi) of OsAMT1;1 was as low as 0.00004 in cultivated rice (Oryza sativa), only
2.3% of that in the common wild rice (O. rufipogon). A single dominant haplotype was fixed at the locus in O.
sativa. The test values for neutrality were significantly negative in the entire region stretching 5’ upstream and 3’
downstream of the gene in all accessions. The value of linkage disequilibrium remained high across a 100 kb
genomic region around OsAMT1;1 in O. sativa, but fell rapidly in O. rufipogon on either side of the promoter of
OsAMT1;1, demonstrating a strong natural selection within or nearby the ammonium transporter.
Conclusions: The severe reduction in nucleotide variation at OsAMT1;1 in rice was caused by a selective sweep
around OsAMT1;1, which may reflect the nitrogen uptake system under strong selection by the paddy soil during
the domestication of rice. Purifying selection also occurred before the wild rice diverged into its two subspecies,
namely indica and japonica. These findings would provide useful insights into the processes of evolution and
domestication of nitrogen uptake genes in rice.

Background
Rice, one of the world’s most important crops, is the staple food of over half of the world’s population. Cultivated
rice occurs in two forms, Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima. Oryza sativa, referred to as the Asian rice, is cultivated worldwide but distributed mainly in Asia and has
two subspecies, indica and japonica, estimated to have
diverged at least about 10,000 years ago [1,2]. The two
subspecies are further divided into major subpopulations:
indica into aus and indica, japonica into temperate japonica, tropical japonica, and the aromatic group [3]. It
has been proposed that these subpopulations were

independently domesticated from divergent pools of
O. rufipogon [3,4].
During the process of domestication, genetic diversity
in rice has reduced dramatically as a result of natural
and artificial selection [5-7]. With the rapid development of molecular genomics, the path of domestication
has been traced in detail through characterization of
several domestication genes associated with artificial
selection. For example, a major gene for grain shattering
in rice, shattering 4 (sh4), has been characterized:
nucleotide diversity of a ~50 kb region surrounding sh4,
is nearly one-tenth of the average value across the entire
chromosome 4 [8,9]. The non-shattering sh4 allele was
fixed in all the O. sativa varieties surveyed. A selective
sweep nearby the sh4 genomic region was probably due
to strong artificial selection of the non-shattering allele,
which confers a trait important to efficient grain harvest
[10]. Similar findings have been reported in two other

selection-related genes in rice, namely Red pericarp (Rc),
which is responsible for pericarp colour, and waxy (wx),
for glutinous grains. The two were under strong artificial selection given the human preference for white rice
and low-amylose grains. As a result, the level of polymorphism in and around these two genes is markedly
reduced [11,12]. Nucleotide diversity in the gene teosinte
branched 1 (tb1), which is involved in plant architecture,
is much lower in maize than in teosinte, the wild relative
of maize. Wang et al. [13] showed that maize has
retained only 3% of the diversity found in teosinte in the
5’ non-transcribed region of tb1, again as a result of
human selection. This selection effect led to a selective
sweep of a 60-90 kb long region across the 5’ promoter
to the tb1-transcribed sequence [14,15]. Similarly,
nucleotide variation in the gene phytoene synthase (Y1),
which makes maize kernels yellow, was only 5.3% of
that in the gene that makes them white, owing to the
human preference for yellow grains, which have higher
nutritional value [16]. Because of the effect of selection
hitchhiking, nucleotide diversity was lower around the
region of Y1 from ~600 kb downstream to ~200 kb
upstream [17]. These results provide significant insights
into the selective sweeps brought about by artificial
selection during the process of crop domestication.
Ammonium is one of the major forms in which nitrogen is available for plant growth and reproduction.
Ammonium absorption from soil is mediated by ammonium transporters (AMT) through both high-affinity
and low-affinity transport systems. The high-affinity
transport system plays a major role when ammonium in
soil is at micromolar ammonium concentrations, and
the low-affinity transport system mainly at millimolar or
higher concentrations [18,19]. Phylogenetic analysis
shows that the two systems are represented by AMT
subfamilies AMT1 and AMT2 respectively [20,21].
Kaiser et al. [22] reported that ammonium uptake
decreased by about 30% in a T-DNA insertion line of
AtAMT1;1 compared to the wild-type, which encodes a
high-affinity ammonium transporter in Arabidopsis
thaliana. Other studies have also confirmed that the
role of AMT1 in other species [23-26].
Rice carries at least twelve AMT genes [21], three of
which, OsAMT1;1 to OsAMT1;3, have been identified as
members of AMT1, each showing a distinct expression
pattern: OsAMT1;1 shows constitutive expression in
both shoots and roots; OsAMT1;2 shows root-specific
and ammonium-inducible expression; and OsAMT1;3
shows root-specific and nitrogen-suppressible expression
[27,28]. OsAMT1;1 has only one open reading frame
encoding 499 amino acid residues. Its transcript was
abundant in roots of plants that were grown under low
levels of NH 4 + but decreased rapidly when the plants
were transferred to a medium with high NH 4 +

concentration [27]. Moreover, OsAMT1;1 expression
was promoted by low ammonium in rice roots [28] and
regulated by endogenous glutamine rather than by
endogenous ammonium [29]. However, nucleotide variations in OsAMT1;1 and in other key genes in the nitrogen uptake and assimilation pathway are yet to be
elucidated, and their evolutionary path from wild rice to
cultivated rice remains unclear.
Improving the uptake and assimilation efficiency of
nitrogen has been a major breeding target in rice, and
success depends largely on discovering allelic variations
of nitrogen metabolism genes in rice germplasm and
understanding their adaptive significance. The objectives
of the present study were 1) to investigate allelic variations of OsAMT1;1, 2) to analyse its pattern of polymorphism and its evolution, and 3) to define the extent
of selective sweep around the OsAMT1;1 region in cultivated rice.

Methods
Rice materials

The nucleotide variation of the OsAMT1;1 gene was
assessed in a panel of 216 Oryza accessions comprising
190 accessions of O. sativa (102 indica, 85 japonica, 2
aromatic, and 1 aus varieties), and 25 of wild rice (19 O.
rufipogon, 5 O. nivara, and 1 O. barthii), and 1 of the
African cultivated rice O. glaberrima (Additional file 1,
Table S1). Most of the O. sativa accessions - 103 of
them were of landraces (http://icgr.caas.net.cn/,
Additional file 1, Table S1) - came from a collection of
Chinese rice varieties estimated to represent about 70%
of the total diversity in Chinese rice germplasm [30].
The other accessions of O. sativa, including 8 landraces,
were selected from the OryzaSNP project http://www.
oryzasnp.org/. The 25 wild relatives with different original sources were obtained from the International Rice
Research Institute (IRRI).
Nucleotide diversity across the genomic region around
OsAMT1;1 was also surveyed by sequencing seven gene
segments from 94 accessions of O. sativa and 19 accessions of O. rufipogon (Additional file 1, Table S1).
PCR and DNA sequencing

Nucleotide diversity in the gene OsAMT1;1 and the surrounding genomic region was assessed by PCR amplification and sequencing. Plant DNA was extracted from
young leaves of each accession using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method described by Rogers
and Bendich [31]. All primers for the PCR were
designed by Primer Premier 5.0 based on the Nipponbare genomic sequence available at the TIGR website
http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/cgi-bin/gbrowse/rice/.
For OsAMT1;1, four pairs of primers were used for PCR
amplification to cover the entire coding sequence,

Ding et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:61
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/61

~1080 bp of the 5’ promoter and ~110 bp of the 3’
untranslated region. For each locus around OsAMT1;1,
one pair of primer was designed to amplify fragments of
the genomic DNA approximately 860-1060 bp long
(Additional file 2, Table S2). To ensure that only the
targeted genomic region is amplified, all PCR primers
were confirmed by BLAST against the Nipponbare
genomic sequence in the NCBI database http://blast.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi.
The PCR experiments were performed on 20 μL
amplification reaction consisting of 0.75 unit of Taq
polymerase (Takara, Dalian, China), 10 mM Tris-HCl,
50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.15 μM
of each primer, and 50 ng of genomic DNA. PCR reactions were carried out in GeneAmp PCR System 9700
(Applied Biosystems, USA) under the following conditions: 5 min at 94°C, followed by 35 cycles of 1 min at
94°C, 1 min at a primer-specific temperature (Additional
file 2, Table S2), and 1 min at 72°C and, for a final
extension, 5 min at 72°C.
PCR products were directly sequenced with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing v3.1 (Applied Biosystems) after digestion and purification according to
the manufacturer’s specifications. Briefly, the PCR products were digested with Exonuclease I (Biolabs Inc.)
and Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (Takara), and purified with 95% ethanol and 3 M sodium acetate (pH
5.2). Sequencing reactions were run on an automated
capillary sequencer ABI 3730, and sequence contigs
were assembled and edited using Sequencher 4.1.2
(Gene Codes Corporation, USA). To ensure reliability
of the sequencing data, PCR amplicons were
sequenced in both orientations, and any remaining
ambiguities in the sequences resolved by repeated PCR
amplification and re-sequencing. Almost all fragments
were homozygous except two fragments from the two
O. rufipogon accessions (DWR35 and DWR38) with
heterozygous sites. PCR products of these two fragments were cloned into pGEM-T easy vectors (Promega, USA) and five independent clones were
sequenced for each fragment. If two different alleles
were found, the predominant allele of the five clones
was arbitrarily chosen for further analysis [11].
Data analysis

Sequences alignment was conducted with ClustalX 1.83
ftp://ftp-igbmc.u-strasbg.fr/pub/ClustalX/. The number
of segregating sites and levels of nucleotide diversity Pi
(π), the average number of nucleotide differences per
site between two sequences [32], and θ, an estimate of
4Neμ, where Ne is the effective population size and μ is
the mutation rate per nucleotide [33], were computed in
DnaSP (version 5.10.00). Tajima’s D test and Fu and Li’s
D* test were also performed in DnaSP for testing

selections deviating from neutrality [34]. Haplotype analysis was conducted using TASSEL (version 2.0.1) [35].
To visualize the impact of sweep selection across the
OsAMT1;1 genomic region, extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) analysis was performed to measure the
degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD), as sweep selection
is expected to elevate the LD nearby the selected site.
EHH was reported on a scale from 0 to 1, with 0 indicating that all extended haplotypes are different and 1
indicating that they are the same [36].
To investigate selection pressure on OsAMT1;1, Ka/Ks
ratios (non-synonymous substitution rate / synonymous
substitution rate) between OsAMT1;1 in rice and its
homologs in the relative species were calculated using
the method described by Goldman and Yang [37].
A Ka/Ks ratio significantly greater than one implies
positive selection, less than one implies purifying selection, and a ratio of one may indicate neutrality [38].

Results
Sequence diversity at OsAMT1;1

Nucleotide polymorphism was examined in 216 accessions across the entire 2.68 kb length of OsAMT1;1
including a 1083 bp fragment of the 5’ promoter region
and a 111 bp fragment of the 3’ untranslated region.
The examination yielded 32 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and 9 insertions or deletions (Indels)
in this 2.68-kb region (Figure 1), of which 30 polymorphism sites (25 SNPs and 5 Indels) were observed
in the wild rice accessions and most were located in the
non-coding region. Five polymorphism sites, at positions
-562, -372, -187, -175, and -22 of the promoter region,
occurred in high or intermediate frequencies in all the
accessions (Figure 1), whereas at the coding region, ten
SNPs - all synonymous variations - occurred rare frequency (well below 5%), indicating that the gene function had been conserved.
Oryza rufipogon was found to be at least 30 times as
diverse as O. sativa across the entire sequenced region,
including the coding and non-coding regions of
OsAMT1;1 (Table 1). Nucleotide diversity π of the entire
gene sequence was 0.00172, and θ was 0.00278 for
O. rufipogon, while estimates of π for indica and japonica were much lower (π = 0.00006 and 0.00002 and θ
= 0.00043 and 0.00007, respectively). These results indicate that the diversity of OsAMT1;1 was much less in O.
sativa than in its wild relatives. In addition, nucleotide
polymorphism in the coding region was much lower
than that in the non-coding region for all accessions
(Table 1). Nucleotide diversity in the coding region was
about a third of that in the non-coding region in O. rufipogon and about half in cultivated rice (Table 1).
Such extreme reduction in diversity of OsAMT1;1 was
observed in both landraces of O. sativa and its elite

Figure 1 Schematic position of nucleotide polymorphisms at OsAMT1;1 and haplotypes across the gene. The short red and black lines
above the model of the gene represent Indels and SNPs respectively, and the numbers below the model indicate their positions relative to the
first base of the start codon (ATG) of OsAMT1;1. For example, pos. 874 means the distance between that SNP and the ATG of OsAMT1;1 is 874 bp
in ‘Nipponbare’. In each haplotype, letters indicate alternative nucleotides at a given position, numbers represent the size (bp) of a deletion (0 =
no deletion), and the line of short dash in haplotype H8 represents a 1 bp deletion. Numbers to the right are those of the accessions contained
in each haplotype.

Results of Tajima’s D and Fu and Li’s D* tests for the
entire region and the non-coding region of OsAMT1;1
were negative and significantly deviated from neutrality
in all accessions, as well as in O. sativa samples. Fu and

across the gene in O. sativa (190 accessions) and
O. rufipogon (19 accessions) revealed a sharp peak at a
point of about 200 bp upstream of the start codon of
the gene (Figure 2). These results suggest a strong selection at OsAMT1;1, particularly in the 5’ promoter
region.
Notably, nine SNPs in the coding region of OsAMT1;1
that occurred in the wild relatives were all synonymous
(Figure 1), suggesting that OsAMT1;1 is under purifying
selection in the wild. To further validate this suggestion,
Ka/Ks ratios were also calculated between OsAMT1;1
and its homologs in O. barthii (DWR50), Sorghum bicolor (Sb06 g022230), and Zea mays (GRMZM2G175140)
from the TIGR website. The ratios ranged from 0.0010
to 0.0344, significantly less than 1.0 (Additional file 3,
Table S3), suggesting strong purifying selection of
OsAMT1;1.
Haplotype variations across OsAMT1;1

A total of 24 haplotypes were identified in the entire
region of gene OsAMT1;1 in the 216 accessions. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these distinct haplotypes
fell into three groups (A, B and C). In group A, four
haplotypes, H1 to H4, were detected in O. sativa. Most
(182/190) accessions of the Asian cultivated rice (both
indica and japonica) belonged to haplotype H1. Each of
the haplotypes H2 to H5 in group A differed from H1
in only a single nucleotide site, whereas haplotype H6
differed from H1 in several sites (Figure 1). The 19
accessions of O. rufipogon fell into as many as 17 distinct haplotypes, indicating a high level of genetic variation in O. rufipogon (Figure 1). In group B,
O. glaberrima and O. barthii had the same haplotype,
H18, indicating their close genetic relationship. Five
O. nivara and four O. rufipogon belonged to group C.
As can be seen in Figure 1, almost all accessions of

To assess the impact of selection at OsAMT1;1, the
extent of nucleotide polymorphism was examined at
seven loci within a region around OsAMT1;1 approximately 150 kb long. The average nucleotide diversity (π)
for O. sativa was low at five loci from -74.1 kb to
27.5 kb (Figure 3A and Table 2) but markedly high at
the other two loci of -101.9 kb and 49.5 kb. The relative
levels of nucleotide diversity between O. sativa and
O. rufipogon were also calculated across the OsAMT1;1
genomic region. A striking reduction in the relative
diversity (the ratio ranged from 0.012 to 0.077) was
observed along the same region mentioned above
(-74.1 kb to 27.5 kb) (Figure 3B and Table 2). These
results indicate a selective sweep around OsAMT1;1
extending about 100 kb in length.
Similar patterns were drawn from Hd, a measure of
haplotype diversity, the value of which for O. sativa was
markedly lower for the five loci along the stretch from
-74.1 kb to 27.5 kb than that for either of the loci at
-101.9 kb or 49.5 kb. However, Hd for O. rufipogon was
much higher across all six loci including the gene
OsAMT1;1 (Table 2). The values of Fu and Li’s D* tests
were significantly negative for the five loci (-74.1 kb to
27.5 kb) in O. sativa, which is a signature of selection in
OsAMT1;1 genomic region from O. rufipogon to
O. sativa (Table 2).

the other two loci (-101.9 kb and 49.5 kb). The high

to 27.5 kb) in O. sativa and the marked reduction in LD
in O. rufipogon on either side of the core location in the
promoter of OsAMT1;1 (Figure 4) support the idea of a
strong selection acting on OsAMT1;1.

Discussion
Diversity and selection of OsAMT1;1

Artificial selection is believed to have played an important role in the severe reduction of genetic diversity in

cultivated rice during its domestication from its wild
ancestors. OsATM1;1 plays a key role in ammonium
uptake and assimilation in rice but whether OsATM1;1
and other nitrogen-uptake genes were subjected to
selection pressure during the domestication process is
an open question. In the present study, we sequenced
the entire gene OsAMT1;1 in a panel of 216 rice accessions, drawn mostly from Chinese cultivated rice
(O. sativa), and observed the predominance of one
major haplotype (H1) and extreme reduction in genetic
diversity of OsAMT1;1 in cultivated rice compared to
that in its wild progenitor O. rufipogon. The level of
nucleotide polymorphism (π = 0.00006) in OsAMT1;1 in
O. sativa was also markedly lower than that in 111 randomly chosen gene fragments (π = 0.0023) [6] and in 10
reference genes from O. sativa (π = 0.0037) [7]. This

severe reduction of genetic diversity in cultivated rice
and Ka/Ks ratios far below 1.0 (Additional file 3, Table
S3) are probably characteristic of very strong selection
pressure acting on OsATM1;1.
The severe reduction of genetic diversity and predominance of a single common haplotype in both subspecies may be a consequence of strong selection for
the promoter region that potentially affects transcription of OsAMT1;1. This strong selection for the noncoding regions of OsATM1;1 in O. sativa is supported
by the significantly negative values of Tajima’s D and
Fu and Li’s D* tests (Table 1). We found that O. sativa
specifically carried three polymorphic sites differing
from the most wild rice accessions at positions of -22,
-175, and -187 that were adjacent to several core
domains such as TATA box in the promoter, which is
a cis-regulatory DNA region that facilitates transcription of a particular gene for functional adaptation. We
observed different expression levels of OsAMT1;1 in
several near-isogenic lines that carried the alleles of
OsAMT1;1 from O. rufipogon and O. sativa in the
similar genetic background (Additional file 6, Figure
S2). The expression of the O. rufipogon alleles in shoot
of the near-isogenic line was significantly higher than
that of ZS97. However, further investigation is necessary to explain the advantages conferred by the
selected allelic variations in OsAMT1;1 during domestication. Several studies have shown that sequence variations in the promoter region result in differential
regulation of transcription. For example, Crawford et
al. [39] revealed that the lactate dehydrogenase-B (LdhB) proximal promoter sequence affected transcriptional
processes and constituted a phenotypic change that
was subject to natural selection by temperature differences. Konishi et al. [40] demonstrated that a singlenucleotide polymorphism in the 5’ regulatory region of
the QTL for seed shattering in chromosome 1 (qSH1)
causes loss of seed shattering and was therefore the
target of artificial selection during rice domestication.
Similarity, the promoter and proximal intergenic
region of tb1 was the target of selection, and a selective sweep ~90 kb in length across this 5’ region
occurred during maize domestication [14,15].
Furthermore, the LD value was high along a ~100 kb
region in O. sativa, but fell sharply in O. rufipogon. Fu
and Li’s D* tests were significant for five loci located in
a region from -74.1 kb to 27.5 kb. These observations
indicate a selective sweep within and nearby OsAMT1;1
(Figure 4 and Table 2). Many agronomically important
genes such as sh4 and waxy were under strong artificial
selection leading to a selective sweep around the site of
those genes. We infer a similar selective sweep around
OsAMT1;1 caused largely by natural selection for an
ammonium transporter.

Reasons for OsAMT1;1 selection

The common wild rice O. rufipogon is found in ditches,
pools, and other sites with shallow, standing, or slowrunning water. In these natural habitats, the level of
nitrogen is extremely low [41]. Nitrogen, either as
ammonia or as nitrite, is present only in traces both in
water and in the sediment around such habitats. Therefore, a nitrogen uptake system that can manage to
obtain nitrogen from such infertile soil was most likely a
target of selection during the transition from the wild
progenitor to cultivated rice. In addition, until the arrival of nitrogenous fertilizers, the major sources of nitrogen were animal excreta and plant and animal residues,
the ultimately usable forms being ammonia, acid amides,
and urea. As a result, ammonium was the main form of
nitrogen in anaerobic rice paddy environments [42] these habitats remained unchanged for thousands of
years until the 20th century, which saw large-scale application of chemical fertilizers. Even for current rice cultivation in paddy fields, ammonium remains the major
form of inorganic nitrogen, making rice almost dependent on ammonium nutrition during a large part of the
cropping season. In terms of the efficiency of fertilizer
use, ammonium is superior to nitrate in paddy soils
[43]. Therefore, a high-affinity ammonia transporter
such as OsAMT1;1 for ammonium uptake in rice
[27,28], would have proved advantageous in adapting to
domestication and remained under continual selection
pressure in low-nitrogen soils.
We note that of 21 annotated genes located in the ~150
kb genomic region around OsAMT1;1 based on the TIGR
website (Additional file 4, Table S4), nine are reported to
be involved in plant responses to such biotic and/or abiotic stresses as extreme temperatures, drought, excess salt,
and infectious pathogens [44-52]. Rice has adapted to
changes in several environmental features (e.g. soil,
water, photoperiod, and pathogens). Selection for these
genes nearby OsAMT1;1 rather than OsAMT1;1 alone
could not be excluded as the cause of the selective sweep
around the OsAMT1;1 genomic region. However, inadequate soil nitrogen should be the most widespread selection pressure in operation for both subspecies,
irrespective of their locations. We therefore suggest that
fixation of the alleles of OsAMT1;1 common to the two
subspecies indica and japonica is the result of a combined force of natural selection for more than one trait.
Unlike the domestication genes, rc, sh4, and wx that were
involved in traits strongly preferred by humans [9], the
gene OsAMT1;1 may have been selected as a results of
soils deficient in nitrogen.
Evolutionary process of OsAMT1;1

In the present study, haplotype H1 is predominant and
fixed at OsAMT1,1 in both subspecies (indica and

Ding et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:61
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/61

japonica). This dominant haplotype was also found in O.
rufipogon albeit in very low frequency - only one O. rufipogon accession, namely DWR25 from Malaysia, carried
it - suggesting a possibility that haplotype H1 first
occurred in one of the subspecies of O. sativa and introgressed into the wild rice. We also observed that one O.
rufipogon accession (DWR27 from China) had only one
SNP (T/A) at position -676 compared to H1 (Figure 1).
This instance of high diversity of the gene in the wild
relatives but uniform outcome because all mutations
were synonymous suggests another possibility, namely
that the haplotype H1 of OsAMT1;1 occurred first in
one of the accessions of O. rufipogon (e.g. DWR27), and
underwent strong selection pressure during domestication. A similar pattern was reported in the non-shattering allele (sh4) fixed in 208 rice cultivars [53]. Actually,
two models, snowballing model and combination model,
were previously proposed considering single and multiple origins of cultivated rice, respectively [9]. These two
models reconciled the data for sh4. These models could
also be applied in OsAMT1;1 as OsAMT1;1 and sh4
shared the same features in terms of the nucleotide
diversity. However, current sequence data from
OsAMT1;1 and sh4 might be not strong enough to distinctly support which model is correct. With the rapid
development of sequencing technology, more genes
similar to OsAMT1;1 and sh4 would be discovered in
the rice genome. Further cloning and functional characterization of these genes will help test the models of rice
domestication.
Additionally, although genetic diversity in indica was
double or triple of that in japonica, genetic diversity in
common wild rice O. rufipogon around OsAMT1;1 was
more than 30 times higher than that both indica and
japonica rice (Table 1). It is remarkable that genetic
diversity in two other nitrogen-related genes decreased
gradually from the wild relatives to the cultivated rice,
whereas the reduction was extreme in the case of
OsAMT1;1 (Additional file 5, Figure S1). Therefore the
selection around OsAMT1;1 may have occurred before
the divergence of indica and japonica. Several domestication genes such as rc and waxy found in domesticated
forms with their favorable alleles occurred first in the
japonica cultivars and experienced the selective sweep
under strong artificial selection during domestication,
causing the alleles to become fixed in all subpopulations
of rice [12,54]. OsAMT1;1 with only one predominant
haplotype in both indica and japonica cultivars even in
landraces supports the contention that the gene was
first under purifying selection in the wild and then
under positive selection during domestication (Additional file 3, Table S3, and Figure 4). However, further
investigations using many more samples drawn from

Page 8 of 10

locations across the world are required for more definitive answers.

Conclusions
The ammonium transporter OsAMT1;1 showed abundant genetic diversity in O. rufipogon – diversity that
has been dramatically lost in O. sativa owing to natural
and artificial selection during the domestication of rice.
This severe reduction in the extent of variation in
nucleotides of OsAMT1;1 in the cultivated rice (O.
sativa) extends to a genomic region about 100 kb long,
indicating a selective sweep around OsAMT1;1. This
study demonstrates that the selective sweep was caused
by strong selection within or nearby the ammonium
transporter during the process of domestication of rice
from its wild progenitors to cultivated rice. Understanding the diversity pattern of the ammonium transporter
gene in rice not only provides valuable information on
the allelic distribution of the nitrogen-uptake gene, but
also gives important insights into the process of domestication of cultivated rice. For example, given the alleles
fixed at OsAMT1;1 in O. sativa, it is possible to discover
novel alleles in wild relatives to broaden the genetic variation for improving the efficiency of nitrogen uptake in
plants. It will also be worthwhile to elucidate the pattern
of diversity of homologs of AMT1 in other crops or of
other nitrogen genes in rice.
