Abstract
Background: The human gastrointestinal (GI) tract microbiota is characterised by an abundance
of uncultured bacteria most often assigned in phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Diversity of this
microbiota, even though approached with culture independent techniques in several studies, still
requires more elucidation. The main purpose of this work was to study whether the genomic
percent guanine and cytosine (%G+C) -based profiling and fractioning prior to 16S rRNA gene
sequence analysis reveal higher microbiota diversity, especially with high G+C bacteria suggested
to be underrepresented in previous studies.
Results: A phylogenetic analysis of the composition of the human GI microbiota of 23 healthy adult
subjects was performed from a pooled faecal bacterial DNA sample by combining genomic %G+C
-based profiling and fractioning with 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing. A total of 3199 partial
16S rRNA genes were sequenced. For comparison, 459 clones were sequenced from a comparable
unfractioned sample. The most important finding was that the proportional amount of sequences
affiliating with the phylum Actinobacteria was 26.6% in the %G+C fractioned sample but only 3.5%
in the unfractioned sample. The orders Coriobacteriales, Bifidobacteriales and Actinomycetales
constituted the 65 actinobacterial phylotypes in the fractioned sample, accounting for 50%, 47% and
3% of sequences within the phylum, respectively.
Conclusion: This study shows that the %G+C profiling and fractioning prior to cloning and
sequencing can reveal a significantly larger proportion of high G+C content bacteria within the
clones recovered, compared with the unfractioned sample in the human GI tract. Especially the
order Coriobacteriales within the phylum Actinobacteria was found to be more abundant than
previously estimated with conventional sequencing studies.

Background
The gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota is considered to play
an important role in human health and disease via essential metabolic, trophic and protective functions in the
host [1]. Since the majority of the GI bacteria are uncultivable, molecular biology methods are needed to reveal
the detailed composition, diversity and specific role of
this complex microbial community [2]. The bacterial
groups most often detected in molecular studies of the
healthy human GI tract are phyla Firmicutes (especially
Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV), Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Fusobacteria and Verrucomicrobia [3].
The predominant microbiota in adults is considered
rather stable and host-specific [4,5], but gender, geographic origin, age [6,7], and host genotype [8] may influence its composition. Furthermore, alterations within an
individual's environmental factors, such as diet [9] and
dietary supplements [10], intestinal health status [11] and
antibiotics [12], may also have a substantial effect on the
intestinal microbiota. Therefore, as a reference to altered
conditions, knowledge of the characteristics of a healthy
intestinal microbiota is essential.
The proportional amounts of bacterial phyla detected in
studies on the GI tract microbiota depend on both the
sample handling and DNA extraction methods applied
[13] and the analysis [14]. Recent metagenomic and pyrosequencing studies on the human intestinal microbiota
highlight the potential amount of the yet undiscovered
diversity of phylotypes and reshape the porportional
abundances of the detected phyla, revealing e.g. a higher
abundance of Actinobacteria than previously estimated
[14-16]. However, the conventional 16S rRNA gene cloning and sequencing is still a valuable method, since it
gives a relatively high taxonomic resolution due to longer
read length [12] and can be targeted to a phylogenetically
relevant gene (16S rRNA gene) in comparison with the
metagenomic approach. Furthermore, the clone library
obtained serves as a valuable reference for possible future
use. To enhance the recovery of phylotypes in bacterial
community samples, the genomic %G+C content -based
profiling and fractioning of DNA can be used [17-20].
In a previous study comparing patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with healthy volunteers, the
faecal DNA of 23 healthy donors was pooled and %G+C
profiled and three selected fractions, covering 34% of the
fractioned DNA, were cloned and sequenced [21]. With
the aim to comprehensively elucidate the bacterial phylotype diversity of the GI microbiota of healthy subjects, the
remaining seven %G+C fractions were cloned and
sequenced in this study, to represent the scale of bacterial
genomic %G+C content ranging from 25% to 75% [22].
For methodological comparison, a clone library from
unfractioned pooled faecal DNA samples of the same

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/68

study subjects was constructed. The results provide more
detailed insight into the human GI microbiota especially
in the context of the diversity of high %G+C bacteria, i.e.
Actinobacteria.

Results
Percent guanine plus cytosine -profiling, cloning and
sequencing
To analyse the diversity of the healthy human intestinal
microbiota, a %G+C profiled and fractionated (Figure 1)
pooled faecal bacterial DNA sample of 23 individuals was
cloned, and the partial 16S rRNA genes were sequenced.
The previously published 976 sequences from three
%G+C fractions (%G+C 25–30, 40–45 and 55–60) [21]
were combined with the 2223 new sequences cloned in
this study (%G+C fractions 30–35, 35–40, 45–50, 50–55,
60–65, 65–70 and 70–75) for phylogenetic and statistical
analyses of the complete %G+C profile ranging from 25%
G+C to 75% G+C (Figure 1, Table 1). Altogether, 3199
sequences encompassing approximately 450 bp from the
5'-end of the 16S rRNA gene, covering two variable areas
V1 and V2, were sequenced from all clones from the fractioned sample. For comparison, 459 clones were
sequenced from an unfractioned pooled faecal bacterial
DNA sample originating from the same individuals.
Determination of operative taxonomic units and library
coverage
The quality-checked 3199 sequences from the combined
fractioned sample libraries represented 455 operative taxonomic units (OTUs), and the 459 sequences from the
unfractioned sample represented 131 OTUs with a 98%
similarity criterion (Table 1). All novel OTUs with less
than 95% sequence similarity to public sequence database
entries were further sequenced to near full-length (Additional file 1). The coverages of the individual clone libraries of the fractioned sample ranged from 77% to 93%,
while the coverage for the unfractioned sample was 86%
[23] (Table 1). Compared with other fractions, the fractions %G+C 50–55, 55–60 and 60–65 had low OTU
numbers and few singletons, resulting in high Good's coverage values. The combined sequences from the fractioned
and unfractioned samples clustered into 481 OTUs (Figure 2).
Phylogenetic analysis and sequence affiliation
When the sequence data from the fractioned clone libraries were combined, the majority of the sequences were
assigned to the phyla Firmicutes (68.5%), Actinobacteria
(26.6%), Bacteroidetes (3.1%) and Proteobacteria (1.3%)
(Figure 2, Table 2, Additional file 1). Clostridium clusters
IV and XIV were the most abundant Firmicutes represented
by 23.5% and 33.0% of the sequences, respectively. The
65 actinobacterial phylotypes consisted of the orders Bifidobacteriales, Coriobacteriales and Actinomycetales account-

d. The combined G+C fractions

ing for 12.4%, 13.4% and 0.8% of the sequences,
respectively (Figure 3, Table 2).
The distribution of phyla within the individual clone
libraries of the fractioned sample revealed that Firmicutes
settled mostly in the lower %G+C content portion of the
profile, whereas Actinobacteria were found in the fractions
with a %G+C content ranging from 50% to 70% (Figure
2, Additional file 1). Prominent phylotypes had a seemingly broader distribution across %G+C fractions. In the
fractions having %G+C content above 65%, a bias was
observed, i.e. a decrease in high G+C Actinobacteria and an
increase in low G+C Firmicutes. The three OTUs with the
highest number of sequences fell into the Clostridium clusters XIVa and IV, representing the species Eubacterium rectale (cluster XIVa), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (cluster IV)
and Ruminococcus bromii (cluster IV) with over 98.7%
sequence similarity.
Within the phylum Actinobacteria, the most abundant
Coriobacteriales phylotypes (6 OTUs) according to the
number of representative clones (228 clones) affiliated
with Collinsella sp. (C. aerofaciens). The remainder represented Atopobium sp., Denitrobacterium sp., Eggerthella sp.,
Olsenella sp. and Slackia sp. The order Bifidobacteriales consisted of 398 sequences and 15 phylotypes out of which
Bifidobacterium adolescentis was the most abundant. Rest of
the bifidobacterial OTUs affiliated with B. catenulatum, B.
pseudocatenulatum, B. bifidum, B. dentium and B. longum.
The order Actinomycetales comprised of 11 OTUs affiliating with Actinomyces sp., Microbacterium sp., Propionibacterium sp., Rhodococcus sp. and Rothia sp. (Figure 3).
The unfractioned sample essentially resembled the %G+C
fractions 40–45 and 45–50 (Figure 2). In comparison to

the combined fractioned clone libraries' the amount of
Firmicutes (93.2%), especially the percentage of the
Clostridium cluster XIV (51.0%), increased while the
number of Actinobacteria (3.5%) decreased. The proportion of Bacteroidetes (2.8%) and Proteobacteria (0.2%) were
the least affected phyla when fractioned and unfractioned
libraries were compared (Figure 2, Table 2, Additional file
1). All 16 actinobacterial sequences of the unfractioned
library were included in OTUs of the fractioned libraries
and Actinomycetales phylotypes were absent in this library
(Figure 3). The phyla Actinobacteria differed significantly
(p = 0.000) between the fractioned and unfractioned
libraries in the UniFrac Lineage-specific analysis, though
the libraries overall were similar according to the UniFrac
Significance test (p = 1.000). Clones from the phylum Firmicutes present in the fractioned library but absent in the
unfractioned library affiliated with Enterococcaceae, Lactobacillaceae and Staphylococcacceae. Furthermore, only one
Gammaproteobacteria was found in the unfractioned
library whereas the fractioned samples contained also the
members of Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and
Deltaproteobacteria (Table 2).
Comparison of individual libraries
The Shared OTUs and Similarity (SONS) program [24]
was used to compare the unfractioned sample with each
of the %G+C fractions and with the combined sequence
data from the fractions (Table 3). Using a 98% similarity
criterion for the phylotypes, at least 80% of sequences
from %G+C fractions 30–35 and 35–40 were shared with
the unfractioned sample (Vobs values). However, for two
of the high %G+C content fractions with %G+C content
from 55 to 65, the Vobs values were considerably lower
(32–33%). When comparing the combined sequence data
from the fractioned sample with the unfractioned sample,

Shannon entropies of clone libraries of the %G+C profiled
sample
The %G+C fractions 50–55 and 55–60 had comparatively
low Shannon entropies (Additional file 2), indicating
lower diversity, and were abundant with bifidobacteria
(Figure 2, Additional file 1). The peripheral %G+C fractions and the %G+C fraction 45–50 with sequences affiliating mainly with Clostridium clusters IV and XIV had
comparatively higher diversity according to Shannon
entropies. The peripheral fraction from the low %G+C
end (25–30% G+C content) contained a substantial proportion of Firmicutes that do not belong to the Clostridum
clusters IV and XIV. It had the highest Shannon entropy
(Additional file 2), indicating rich diversity, and did not
reach a plateau in the rarefaction curves (data not shown),
which means that more OTUs would have been likely to
appear after further sequencing.

Discussion
For a comprehensive evaluation of the human intestinal
microbiota, 16S rRNA gene clone libraries were constructed from a %G+C fractioned pooled faecal DNA sample of 23 healthy subjects followed by a sequence analysis
of 3199 clones. Previously, only selected fractions of such
profiles have been sequenced and analysed. For methodological comparison, a 16S rRNA gene library of unfractioned DNA from 22 individuals representing the same
subject group was also constructed. The %G+C fractioning
prior to cloning and sequencing enhanced the recovery of

A high amount of actinobacterial sequences recovered
If the proportional amount of DNA in each fraction is
taken into account in estimating the abundance of phyla,
28.5% of the sequences would affiliate with Actinobacteria.
Since the %G+C profile fractions represent individual
cloning and sequencing experiments, in which an equal
amount of clones were sequenced despite the different
proportional amounts of DNA within the fractions, quantitative conclusions should be drawn carefully. However,
%G+C fractions 50–70 were dominated by Actinobacteria,
comprising 41% of the total DNA in the original sample
fractioned (Figures 1 and 2, Additional file 1). The %G+C
fractions 30–50 yield a similar phylotype distribution as
the unfractioned library (Figure 2). These fractions,
accounting for 54% of the profiled DNA, are dominated
by the Firmicutes (Clostridium clusters XIV and IV) (Figure
1 and 2).

The relatively high proportion of actinobacterial
sequences (26.6%) and phylotypes (65) identified in the
combined sequence data of the %G+C fractioned sample
exceed all previous estimations. In a metagenomic study
by Gill and colleagues [14], 20.5% of 132 16S rRNA
sequences from random shotgun assemblies affiliated
with 10 phylotypes of Actinobacteria whereas no Bacteroidetes was detected. In accordance with our results, also a
pyrosequencing study by Andersson and colleagues [16],
the Actinobacteria (14.6%), dominated by a few phylotypes, outnumbered Bacteroidetes (2.5%). By contrast, in
most of the earlier published studies on human faecal
samples applying 16S rRNA gene amplification, cloning
and sequencing, the relative amount of Actinobacteria has
been 0–6% of the detected intestinal microbiota [12,2533]. Thus, the proportion of sequences affiliating with
Actinobacteria (3.5%) in the unfractioned sample analysed
in this study is comparable with previous estimations
applying conventional 16S rRNA cloning and sequencing
without %G+C fractioning.
Order Coriobacteriales abundant within Actinobacteria
We observed that several clones in the high %G+C fractions (60–70% G+C content) were tricky to sequence due
to extremely G+C rich regions. These clones turned out to
be members of order Coriobacteriales, which have been
rare or absent in earlier 16S rRNA gene -based clone libraries of the intestinal microbiota. Over half of the actinobacterial OTUs in our study belonged to the order
Coriobacteriales. Harmsen et al. [34] earlier suggested that
applications based on 16S rRNA gene cloning as well as
other methods of molecular biology may overlook the

presence of the family Coriobacteriaceae in the human GI
tract and they designed a group-specific probe for Atopobium (Ato291), covering most of the Coriobacteriaceae, the
Coriobacterium group. Using Ato291, the abundance of
detected intestinal cells in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is up to 6.3%. [6,7,35,36]. Recently, Khachatryan and colleagues [8] did not detect any Actinobacteria
from the 16S rRNA gene clone libraries of healthy subjects
but the abundance with FISH using Ato291 was 7%. The
authors suggested that constant underestimation of the
high G+C Gram-positive bacteria might lead to misunderstanding their role in the healthy and diseased gut.
There are some data suggesting that the members of Coriobacteriaceae may be indicators of a healthy GI microbiota.
Subjects with a low risk of colon cancer have been
observed to have a higher incidence of Collinsella aerofaciens than subjects with a high risk of colon cancer [37].
Furthermore, when faecal 16S rRNA gene sequences from
metagenomic libraries of Crohn's diseased and healthy
subjects were compared, the Atopobium group was more
prevalent and the groups designated "other Actinobacteria"
were exclusively detected in healthy subjects' samples
[11]. A lower abundance of a C. aerofaciens-like phylotype
within the Atopobium group has been associated with IBS
subjects' samples [21]. Diminished amount of Atopobium
group bacteria is also associated with patients with Mediterranean fever [8]. On the other hand, increased amount
of Actinobacteria have recently been associated with the

faecal microbiota of obese subjects [32]. This indicates
that more detailed data are required to judge the role of
Actinobacteria in health and disease.
Methodological observations
When the %G+C gradient is disassembled, the fractions
with the highest G+C content are collected last, making
them most susceptible to turbulence. This phenomenon
together with possible remnants of DNA from previously
collected fractions could have caused the bias of a
decrease in high G+C Actinobacteria and an increase in low
G+C Firmicutes observed in fractions %G+C 65–75. These
fractions, however, comprise only 5.5% of the total DNA,
making the observed bias less important. Regarding faecal
DNA extraction, the method used here was rather rigorous, allowing efficient DNA isolation also from more
enduring Gram-positive bacteria. This might lower the relative amount of DNA from more easily lysed Gram-negative bacteria and thus explain the comparatively low
amount of Bacteroides in both of the samples. Moreover,
the relative share of Bacteroidetes phyla may be affected by
the delay and temperature of freezing. In a real-time PCR
study, a decrease of 50% in the Bacteroides group was
observed in faecal sample aliquots frozen in -70°C within
4 h compared to samples that were immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen (Salonen et al., personal communication). In our study, the samples were transported within
4 h of the defecation and stored at -70°C.

The phyla Actinobacteria were the second most abundant
phyla detected in the %G+C fractioned sample consisting

Abundance of Actinobacteria in the faeces of Scandinavian
(Finnish and Swedish) subjects has been discovered independent of the methodology; the techniques used include
%G+C profiling and 16S rDNA gene cloning (this study),
FISH coupled with flow cytometry [7] and pyrosequencing [16]. These findings may suggest existence of demographic similarities among Scandinavians, which could be
caused by environmental or genetic factors and that are
not obscured by methodological bias of DNA extraction,
primers and PCR conditions used.

Conclusion
The results further confirm that %G+C fractioning is an
efficient method prior to PCR amplification, cloning and
sequencing to obtain a more detailed understanding of
the diversity of complex microbial communities, especially within the high genomic %G+C content region. This
is proven by the proportionally greater amount of OTUs
and sequences affiliating with the high G+C Gram-positive phylum Actinobacteria in the 16S rRNA gene clone
libraries originating from a %G+C-profiled and -fractioned faecal microbial genomic DNA sample compared
with a sample cloned and sequenced without prior %G+C
profiling. The clone content obtained from the unfractioned library is in accordance with many previous clone
library analyses and thus suggests that the potential

Study subjects
The faecal samples were collected from 23 healthy donors
(females n = 16, males n = 7), with an average age of 45
(range 26–64) years, who served as controls for IBS studies [21,38-40]. Exclusion criteria for study subjects were
pregnancy, lactation, organic GI disease, severe systematic
disease, major or complicated abdominal surgery, severe
endometriosis, dementia, regular GI symptoms, antimicrobial therapy during the last two months, lactose intolerance and celiac disease. All participants gave their
written informed consent and were permitted to withdraw
from the study at any time.
Faecal DNA samples
Faecal samples were immediately stored in anaerobic conditions after defecation, aliquoted after homogenization
and stored within 4 h of delivery at -70°C. The bacterial
genomic DNA from 1 g of faecal material was isolated
according to the protocol of Apajalahti and colleagues
[41]. Briefly, undigested particles were removed from the
faecal material by three rounds of low-speed centrifugation and bacterial cells were collected with high-speed
centrifugation. The samples were then subjected to five
freeze-thaw cycles, and the bacterial cells were lysed by
enzymatic (lysozyme and proteinase K) and mechanical
(vortexing with glass beads) means. Following cell lysis,
the DNA was extracted and precipitated.
Percent guanine plus cytosine fractioning and purification
of fractions
The faecal microbial DNA of 23 healthy individuals was
pooled, and genomic DNA fractions were separated with
5% intervals on the basis of %G+C content using caesium
chloride-bisbenzimidazole gradient analysis described in
previous studies [21,41]. The gradient was disassembled
into %G+C fractions with 5 G+C% intervals using perfluorocarbon (fluorinert) as a piston. In the procedure,
the highest %G+C fraction is collected last, exposing it to
the most turbulence. The DNA quantification during the
dismantlement was based on A280, as described by Apajalahtiand colleagues [41], to avoid background. The DNA
fractions were desalted with PD-10 columns according to
the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences,
Uppsala, Sweden). For the unfractioned DNA sample, faecal microbial DNA of the same healthy individuals was
pooled (n = 22; there was an insufficient amount of faecal
DNA left for one of the individuals).

Amplification of the 16S rRNA genes, cloning and
sequencing
The 16S rRNA gene from each of the seven DNA fractions
was amplified, cloned and sequenced, as in the study by
Kassinen and colleagues [21]. To maximize the recovery
of different phylotypes, two universal primer pairs were
used independently for all samples. The first primer pair
corresponded to Escherichia coli 16S rRNA gene positions
8–27 and 1492–1512, with sequences 5'-AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG-3' [42] and 5'-ACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT-3' [43], respectively. The second primer pair
corresponded to E. coli 16S rRNA gene positions 7–27 and
1522–1541, with sequences 5'-GAGAGTTTGATYCTGGCTCAG-3' and 5'-AAGGAGGTGATCCARCCGCA-3'
[44], respectively. The 50-μl PCR reactions contained 1 ×
DyNAzyme™ Buffer (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland), 0.2
mM of each dNTP, 50 pmol of primers, 1 U of
DyNAzyme™ II DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland), 0.125 U of Pfu DNA polymerase (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) and 10 μl of desalted fractioned DNA
template (containing less than 2 ng/μl of DNA) or pooled
extracted DNA from the faecal samples. The thermocycling conditions consisted of 3 min at 95°C, followed by
a variable number of cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 50°C,
2 min at 72°C and a final extension of 10 min at 72°C.
The number of PCR cycles used for each fraction was optimized to the minimum amount of cycles which resulted
in a visually detectable band of the PCR product on ethidium bromide stained agarose gel. A protocol of 27, 20, 25
and 30 cycles was applied to %G+C fraction 25–30, 30–
60, 60–65 and 65–75, respectively. The 16S rRNA gene
from the unfractioned pooled faecal DNA sample was
amplified using 20 PCR cycles. The amplifications were
performed using 15 reactions, and the products were
pooled, concentrated using ethanol precipitation, and
eluted with 50 μl of deionized MilliQ water (Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA).

The precipitated PCR products were purified with the
QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), or using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) after excising from 1.25% SeaPlaque
agar (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ, USA), and eluted in
35 μl of elution buffer. The concentration of the purified
amplicons was estimated with serially diluted samples on
0.8% agarose gels with ethidium bromide staining. To
enhance the cloning efficiency, adenine overhangs were
added to the amplicons as follows: The two purified
inserts were mixed in a 1:1 molecular ratio (the reaction
mixture thus contained 10–30 ng/μl DNA) and incubated
in a volume of 20 μl with 1 × DyNAzyme™ Buffer
(Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland), 0.2 mM dNTPs and 0.4 U of
DyNAzyme™ II DNA Polymerase (Finnzymes, Espoo, Finland) for 40 min at 72°C. The cloning was performed
with the QIAGEN® PCR Cloning plus Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/68

For the ligation reaction, 2 μl of the reaction mixture used
for adding adenine overhangs to the amplicons was used
as an insert. The ligation reaction was incubated overnight
at 4°C. The plasmids were isolated and purified from the
E. coli culture using MultiScreenHTS (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA), and aliquots were stored in -80°C.
The cloned inserts were amplified from the pDrive plasmids using M13 forward 5'-GTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3'
and M13 reverse primers 5'-AACAGCTATGACCATG-3',
visualized on a 1% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and purified using a MultiScreen PCR384 Filter Plate
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Sequencing of the 5'-end
of 16S rDNA clones was performed with primer pD' 5'GTATTACCGCGGCTGCTG-3' corresponding to the E. coli
16S rRNA gene position 536-518 [45]. Near full-length
sequencing was performed on one representative of each
OTU showing less than 95% similarity to any EMBL
nucleotide sequence database entry. For this purpose,
primers pF' 5'-ACGAGCTGACGACAGCCATG-3' [45] and
pE 5'-AAACTCAAAGGAATTGACGG-3' [46], corresponding to E. coli 16S rRNA gene positions 1073-1053 and
908–928, respectively, were used. Sequencing of the products was performed with the BigDye terminator cycle
sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA,
USA). For templates that failed to be sequenced due to
high G+C content, 1% (v/v) of dimethyl sulfoxide was
added to the reaction mixture. The sequencing products
were cleaned with Montage SEQ96 plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and run with an ABI 3700 Capillary DNA
Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
Sequence analysis and alignment
Sequences were checked manually utilizing the Staden
Package pregap4 version 1.5 and gap v4.10 assembly programs [47], and primer sequences were removed.
Sequences that occurred in more than one clone library
were considered non-chimeric. Revealing the potential
chimeras was also performed by manually browsing the
ClustalW 1.83 sequence alignment [48] with Bio Edit version 7.0.5.3 [49] and for the near full-length sequences
using Ribosomal Database Project II Chimera Check [50].
Sequences from %G+C fractions 25–30, 40–45 and 55–
60 with accession numbers AM275396-AM276371 [21]
were added prior to further analyses. Sequences of all fractions and the unfractioned sample were aligned separately
with ClustalW 1.83 [48] using the FAST DNA pair-wise
alignment algorithm option (Gap penalty 3, Word size 4,
Number of top diagonals 1 and Window size 1) and cut
from E. coli position 430 (totally conserved GTAAA) with
BioEdit version 7.0.5.3 [49]. The lengths of the alignments of the fractioned sample and the unfractioned sample were 478 and 457 base pairs, respectively. The 16S
rRNA variable regions V1 and V2 were included in the
alignments. The variable regions V1 and V2 have been
demonstrated to be sufficient to reflect the diversity of a

human GI clone library [51]. The alignments were visually
inspected, but they were not edited manually to avoid
subjectivity and to maintain reproducibility of the alignments. From the cut alignments, distance matrices were
created with Phylip 3.66 Dnadist [52] using Jukes-Cantor
correction.
Determination of OTUs and library coverage
The sequences were assigned into OTUs according to the
distance matrices using DOTUR [53], applying the furthest neighbour rule option in which all sequences within
an OTU fulfil the similarity criterion with all the other
sequences within the OTU. The 98% cut-off for sequence
similarity was used to delimit an OTU. The coverage of the
clone libraries was calculated with the formula of Good
[23] to evaluate the adequacy of amount of sequencing.
The Fasta EMBL Environmental and EMBL Prokaryote
database searches [54] and Ribosomal Database Project II
(RDP II) Classifier Tool [55] were used to affiliate phylotypes.
Phylogenetic analysis
For the phylogenetic analysis, all sequences from the
%G+C fractioned sample and the unfractioned sample
were aligned and designated into OTUs with a 98% cutoff as described above. A representative sequence of each
OTU and unaligned reference sequences representing different clostridial groups (Additional file 3) were aligned
with ClustalW 1.83 using the SLOW DNA alignment algorithm option (Gap penalty 3, Word size 1, Number of top
diagonals 5 and Window size 5) and cut from the E. coli
position 430 (totally conserved GTAAA) with BioEdit version 7.0.5.3[49]. For a profile alignment, 16S rRNA reference sequences, aligned according to their secondary
structure, were selected from the European ribosomal
RNA database [56] (Additional file 4) so that they would
represent the overall diversity of the faecal microbiota,
including the most common clostridial 16S rRNA groups
expected, and sequences closely related to the OTUs composed of over 20 sequences. The sequences in this study
were profile-aligned against the European ribosomal RNA
database secondary structure-aligned sequences using
ClustalW 1.83 profile alignment mode and the SLOW
DNA alignment algorithm option (Gap penalty 3, Word
size 1, Number of top diagonals 5 and Window size 5).
The reference sequences were then deleted from the alignment with BioEdit version 7.0.5.3 [49], and the alignment
was cut at the E. coli position 430 (totally conserved
GTAAA). A phylogenetic tree with a representative
sequence from each OTU was generated with a neighbourjoining algorithm from a Jukes-Cantor-corrected distance
matrix using Phylip 3.66 dnadist and neighbour [52]. The
tree was visualized with MEGA4 [57].

A phylogenetic tree was constructed for the OTU representatives of the phylum Actinobacteria. For Bifidobacteri-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/9/68

ales and Actinomycetales, sequences with nearest FASTA
EMBL Prokaryote search (all >98% similarity), and for
Coriobacteriales sequences with nearest FASTA EMBL
prokaryote and environmental database searches (>85%
and >91%, respectively), were selected and aligned
together with OTU representative sequences. Sequences
from the European ribosomal RNA database representing
Actinobacteria and Clostridium leptum (AF262239) were
used as a reference in the profile alignment (Additional
file 4). The alignment, distance matrix, and visualizing
was done as described above. A bootstrap analysis of hundred replicates was performed using seqboot and consense programs of Phylip 3.66 [52].
To describe whether the phylogenies of the combined
sequence data from the fractioned libraries and the
unfractioned library were significantly different, the UniFrac Significance analysis was applied for each pair of
environments using abundance weights [58]. The UniFrac
Lineage-specific analysis was used to break the tree up into
the lineages at a specified distance from the root, and to
test whether any particular group differed between the
sample libraries [58]. The phylogenetic tree for the analyses was constructed from OTU representative sequences
determined separately for the combined fractioned libraries and for the unfractioned library as described above,
with the exception that in the profile alignment a root
sequence (Methanobrevibacter smithii AF054208) was
added and left to the alignment.
Comparison of individual libraries using SONS
The microbial community composition differences
between libraries of individual %G+C profile fractions
and the unfractioned sample were analysed using SONS
[24], which calculates the fraction of sequences observed
in shared OTUs in each library (Uobs and Vobs) and the
observed fraction of shared OTUs in each library
(Aotu_shared and Botu_shared). For the SONS analyses, an
alignment with all of the sequences from the clone libraries of the fractioned sample and the unfractioned sample
was created, and a distance matrix was calculated as
described above in the Sequence analysis and alignment section.
Shannon entropies of clone libraries of the %G+C profiled
sample
To compare the diversity of the clone libraries derived
from the fractioned sample, OTUs were also determined
using a Bayesian clustering method [59], followed by the
estimation of Shannon entropies with a standard Bayesian multinomial-Dirichlet model. In the estimation, 100
000 Monte Carlo samples were used for each library under
a uniform Dirichlet prior [60]. The Shannon entropy
value correlates with the amount and evenness of clusters
or phylotypes in a community sample, but disregards the
disparity between them [61]. The Bayesian clustering

method groups the sequences into clusters more distinct
from each other than would, for example, the ClustalW
alignment-based Jukes-Cantor-corrected distance matrices, demanding more disparity among the sequences
present in a sample for them to form separate clusters.
