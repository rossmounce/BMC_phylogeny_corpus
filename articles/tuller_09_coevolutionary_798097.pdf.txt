Abstract
Background: The introduction of measures such as evolutionary rate and propensity for gene loss
have significantly advanced our knowledge of the evolutionary history and selection forces acting
upon individual genes and cellular processes.
Results: We present two new measures, the 'relative evolutionary rate pattern' (rERP), which
records the relative evolutionary rates of conserved genes across the different branches of a
species' phylogenetic tree, and the 'copy number pattern' (CNP), which quantifies the rate of gene
loss of less conserved genes. Together, these measures yield a high-resolution study of the coevolution of genes in 9 fungal species, spanning 3,540 sets of orthologs. We find that the
evolutionary tempo of conserved genes varies in different evolutionary periods. The co-evolution
of genes' Gene Ontology categories exhibits a significant correlation with their functional distance
in the Gene Ontology hierarchy, but not with their location on chromosomes, showing that cellular
functions are a more important driving force in gene co-evolution than their chromosomal
proximity. Two fundamental patterns of co-evolution of conserved genes, cooperative and
reciprocal, are identified; only genes co-evolving cooperatively functionally back each other up. The
co-evolution of conserved and less conserved genes exhibits both commonalities and differences;
DNA metabolism is positively correlated with nuclear traffic, transcription processes and vacuolar
biology in both analyses.
Conclusions: Overall, this study charts the first global network view of gene co-evolution in fungi.
The future application of the approach presented here to other phylogenetic trees holds much
promise in characterizing the forces that shape cellular co-evolution.

Background

The molecular clock hypothesis states that throughout evolutionary history mutations occur at an approximately uniform
rate [1,2]. In many cases this hypothesis provides a good
approximation of the actual mutation rate [2,3] while in other

cases it has proven unrealistic [2,4]. The evolutionary rate
(ER) of a gene, the ratio between the number of its non-synonymous to synonymous mutations, dN/dS, is a basic measure of evolution at the molecular level. This measure is
affected by many systemic factors, including gene dispensa-

bility, expression level, number of protein interactions, and
recombination rate [5-11]. Since the factors that influence
evolutionary rate are numerous and change in a dynamic
fashion, it is likely that the evolutionary rate of an individual
gene may vary between different evolutionary periods. Previous studies have investigated co-evolutionary relationships
between genes on a small scale, mainly with the aim of inferring functional linkage [12-17]. These studies were mostly
based on the genes' phyletic patterns (the occurrence pattern
of a gene in a set of current organisms). Recently, Lopez-Bigas
et al. [18] performed a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of different functional categories in humans. They
showed that certain functional categories exhibit dynamic
patterns of sequence divergence across their evolutionary history. Other studies have examined the correlations between
genes' evolutionary rates to predict physical protein-protein
interactions [19-24]. A recent publication by Juan et al. [24]
focused on Escherichia coli and generated a co-evolutionary
network containing the raw tree similarities for all pairs of
proteins in order to improve the prediction accuracy of protein-protein interactions. Here our goal and methodology are
different; we concentrate on a set of nine fungal species spanning approximately 1,000 million years [25]. We develop
tools to investigate co-evolution in both conserved and lessconserved genes. For the first group, whose members have an
identical phylogenetic tree, we employ high-resolution ER
measures to investigate gene co-evolution. In the case of less
conserved genes, we generalize the concept of propensity for
gene loss [17] to encompass the whole phylogenetic tree in
order to better understand the driving forces behind co-evolution.

Results and discussion

The first part of this paper describes the analysis of conserved
genes. We define a new measure of co-evolution for such
genes and study their evolutionary rates along different parts
of the evolutionary tree. Next, we reconstruct a co-evolutionary network of genes and a co-evolutionary network of cellular processes according to this measure. In such a network
two genes/processes are connected if their co-evolution is
correlated. We identify two patterns of co-evolution, correlated (cooperative) and anti-correlated (reciprocal). We show
that co-evolution is significantly correlated with co-functionality but not with chromosomal co-organization of genes. We
conclude this part by identifying clusters of functions in the
co-evolutionary network. Subsequently, in the second part of
the paper, we study the evolution of less-conserved genes. We
describe a new measure of evolution for such genes and
reconstruct a co-evolutionary network of cellular processes
according to this measure. We study the resulting clusters in
this network and compare it to the co-evolutionary network of
the conserved genes.

The co-evolution of conserved genes
Computing the relative evolutionary rate pattern
First, we focus on the large set of conserved genes (that is,
genes that are conserved in all fungal species analyzed), identifying sequence co-evolutionary relationships that are manifested in the absence of major gene gain and loss events. As
these co-evolutionary relationships cannot be deciphered by
an analysis based on phyletic patterns, and a single evolutionary rate measure is too crude for capturing them, we set out to
measure the relative evolutionary rate of each gene at every
branch of the evolutionary tree. The resulting new 'relative
evolutionary rate pattern' (rERP) measure characterizes a
gene's pattern of evolution as a vector of all its relative evolutionary rates in the different branches of a species' phylogenetic tree. A workflow describing the determination of genes'
ERPs is presented in Figure 1 (for a detailed description of the
workflow described in this figure and comparison to other
measures of co-evolution see Materials and methods). We
analyzed genes from nine fungal species, whose phylogenetic
relationship (based on the 18S rDNA [26] and on the comparison of 531 informative proteins [27]) is presented in Figure 2.
We first created a set of orthologous genes (lacking paralogs)
that are conserved in all species, resulting in a dataset of 1,372
sets of orthologs spanning a total of 12,348 genes. Each such
set of orthologous genes (SOG) was then aligned, and its
ancestral sequences at the internal nodes of the phylogenetic
tree were inferred using maximum likelihood. The resulting
sets of orthologs and ancestral sequences were then used to
estimate the evolutionary rate, dN/dS [28], along each of the
tree branches. To consider the selection forces acting on synonymous (S) sites we used an approach similar to that of [29]
and adjusted the evolutionary rates accordingly. These
adjusted evolutionary rates are denoted dN/dS', and compose
an ERP vector that specifies a dN/dS' value for each branch of
the evolutionary tree, for each SOG. We next carried out an
analysis of the resulting ERP matrix, whose rows are the
SOGs, its columns are the tree branches, and its entries
denote evolutionary rate values (dN/dS').

The evolutionary rate along different branches of the evolutionary
tree
Our first task was to characterize the global selection regimes
acting upon the genes studied. We conservatively limit this
investigation to the short branches of the tree (excluding
branches (7,15), (15,16), (8,16), (9,16); Figures 2 and 3) to
avoid potential saturation problems that may bias the ER
computation (Materials and methods). Most of the genes
exhibit purifying selection (dN/dS' < 0.9) in the majority of
the phylogenetic branches, as one would expect [30]. A much
smaller group of genes under positive (dN/dS' > 1.1) and neutral (0.9 <dN/dS' < 1.1) selection are concentrated in three
branches (Figure 3), with the majority located on the branch
leading from internal node 12 to internal node 11, probably
following the whole genome duplication event known to have
occurred at this bifurcation [31]. This major duplication event

probably served as a driving force underlying this surge of
positive selection, by relaxing the functional constraints acting on each of the gene copies [32]. This branch also represents a switch from anaerobic (Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
Saccharomyces bayanus and Candida glabrata) to aerobic
(Aspergillus nidulans, Candida albicans, Debaryomyces
hansenii, Kluyveromyces lactis, Yarrowia lipolytica) metabolism [33], which has likely required a large burst of positive
evolution in many genes. Additional data file 1 includes a
table that depicts the SOGs with positive evolution along this
branch (using their S. cerevisiae representative), which is
indeed enriched with many metabolic genes. The other two
branches under positive selection are the branch between
nodes 13 and 14, leading to a subgroup (D. hansenii and C.
albicans) that evolved a modified version of the genetic code
[34], and the branch between nodes 13 and 15 that leads to Y.

The major goal of this work is to study the co-evolution of
gene pairs and of cellular processes. To this end we utilized
the ERP matrix to compute the rERP of each conserved SOG.
The rERP is a vector containing the relative, ranked dN/dS'
(rER) of each SOG in every branch of the evolutionary tree,
thus comparing the evolutionary rate of each individual SOG
to that of all other SOGs. The ranking procedure is employed
to attenuate the effects of noisy estimations of ER values,
especially in long branches of the phylogenetic tree (see Note
1 in Additional data file 2). Defining the rERP of a Gene
Ontology (GO) process to be the mean rERP of all the genes it
contains, we asked which GO processes have the rERP with
the highest mean and the highest variance across the different
branches of the evolutionary tree (Figure 4). Notably, processes related to energy production, such as the tricarboxylic
acid cycle (involved in cellular respiration), and ATP synthesis-coupled proton transport (which includes genes encoding
the mitochondrial ATPase) have the highest mean rERP and
also exhibit the highest variance of their rERP. This reflects
the primary role that energy production has played in fungal
evolution, and the effects that changes from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism have had on the development of fungal species. Additional high rERP energy-related GO terms include
aerobic respiration and heme biosynthesis. Interestingly, biological functions related to information flow within the cell
exhibit high mean rERP values (tRNA export from nucleus,
DNA recombination) or high rERP variance (transcription
initiation from polymerase II promoter, RNA processing,
transcription termination from RNA polymerase II promoter). The trend, however, is not identical for all processes:
protein import to the nucleus, for example, has a high rERP
value but very little variance. Full lists of conserved genes and
GO groups sorted according to their mean rERP and rERP
variance appear in Additional data file 3.

We carried out a hierarchical clustering of GO-slim functions
according to their rERP values, which is depicted in Figure 5.
Many GO-slim groups exhibit correlated rERP values. For
example, processes related to metabolic activity (such as cellular respiration, carbohydrate metabolism, and generation
of precursor metabolites and energy) exhibit high rERP values across the tree, whereas others (cell cycle and meiosis)
exhibit markedly lower values. Interestingly, processes
related to polarized growth and budding exhibit the lowest
overall rERPs. Importantly, the figure shows that rERP values
can provide additional information to that contained in the
global relative evolutionary rates (that is, those measured by
aggregating the whole tree). For example, the two GO-slim
process groups plasma membrane and microtubule organization center (Figure 5, middle) have relatively similar (low) relative global evolutionary rates but markedly different rERPs
(as they appear in the two extreme parts of the hierarchical
clustering). While the standard ER measure checks if the
average ER of genes is similar (that is, |ER1 - ER2|), rERP
compares the fluctuations in the ER of genes. Thus, two SOGs
may appear similar by one measure and very different when
applying the other. Figure 6 shows two examples in which the
two measures provide opposite results. Notably, the correlation between these two measures is significant but rather low
(r = -0.055, P < 10-16). Overall, GO groups with functionally
related gene sets (that is, those that map closer on the GO

ontology network) tend to have similar rERP values (the correlation between distance in the GO graph and average correlation of rERP is -0.96, P-value < 4.5 × 10-4; see more details
in Figure 7, Additional data file 4, and Materials and methods; this comparison is made using the S. cerevisiae GO
ontology and mapping all the SOGs to this ontology).

Two fundamental types of co-evolution
Having a representative rERP vector for each SOG/process
enables us to examine the correlations between them and to
learn about their co-evolutionary history. A positive rERP
correlation arises when two SOGs/processes exhibit a similar
pattern of change in the different branches of the evolutionary tree and have evolved in a coordinated, cooperative Ctype fashion. A simple example of such a co-evolution is the
mitochondrial genome maintenance and mitochondrial electron transport categories. A marked negative rERP correlation denotes reciprocal, R-type co-evolution where periods of
rapid evolution of one SOG/process are coupled with slow
evolution in the other; this may arise when the rapid evolution of one process creates a new niche or biochemical activity
that, in turn, enables, or selects for, the rapid evolution of the
other process. An illustrative R-type example involves the category of methionine biosynthesis, which has a negative rERP
correlation with phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis. PC is
synthesized by three successive transfers of methyl groups

may be conditioned on the evolution of the methionine biosynthesis pathway, and thus follow it with some time lag (Figure 8). Interestingly, genes that co-evolve in a C-type manner
do provide functional backups to each other, having a statis-

tically significant enrichment in genetic interactions (hypergeometric P-value < 0.0039), while genes co-evolving in an
R-type manner do not (where the enrichment is studied using
the S. cerevisiae genes in each of the pertaining SOGs). We
also found that the fraction of sequence-similar SOGs is significantly larger among pairs of C-type co-evolving genes than

To track down the co-evolution of SOGs, we generated a coevolution network where two SOGs (termed, for convenience,
according to the S. cerevisiae genes they contain) are connected by an edge only if there is a significant (either positive
or negative) Spearman rank correlation (with P < 0.05)

between two nodes is 5.03). Many biological networks (for
example, see [38,39]) exhibit similar properties. The degree
in the co-evolutionary network is significantly correlated with
the degree in the S. cerevisiae protein interaction network (r
= 0.0726, P = 0.0125) but is not significantly correlated with
the degree in the S. cerevisiae genetic interaction network, or
with the degree in its gene expression network.

Co-evolution is correlated with similar functionality
A co-evolution network of cellular functional categories was
built for each of the three GO ontologies (biological process,
cellular component, molecular function), using two significance cutoff values (Spearman P-value < 0.01 and Spearman
P-value < 0.001) to determine significant correlations
between GO categories. A list of highly correlated pairs of GO
terms is provided in Additional data file 5. The correlation
between the distance of GO groups in the 0.001 cutoff co-evolution network (that is, their evolutionary distance) and their

An illustrative example involves the category of methionine biosynthesis, which has a negative rERP correlation with phosphatidylcholine (PC) biosynthesis,
an important and abundant structural component of the membranes of eukaryotic cells. PC is synthesized by three successive transfers of methyl groups
from S-adenosyl-methionine to phosphatidyl-ethanolamine [36,37]; thus, the evolution of PC biosynthetic pathways may be conditioned by the evolution
of methionine biosynthesis pathways, and follow it by some time lag. This phenomenon is demonstrated in the subtree below internal node 11 (a). The
rERPs of these two GO functions are shown in (b).

their functional distance) is highly significant: 0.38 for cellular component, 0.16 for biological process and 0.43 for molecular function (all three with P-values <10-16; a similar trend is
observed using the 0.01 cutoff network). A similarly marked
correlation between evolutionary and functional relation-

and negative co-evolution networks separately (Note 3 in

Similar results were observed when we considered classification according to Enzyme Commission (EC) number [40],

teins that are not a part of the same complex (P < 10-16). The
Spearman correlation between rERP levels of genetically
interacting proteins is 0.02, which is 32 times higher than the
average correlation (6.08 × 10-4) for non-interacting proteins
(P = 2.71 × 10-6). Protein rERPs are also correlated with the
co-expression of their genes (Spearman correlation 0.063, P
< 10-16). The significant correlation between co-evolution and
physical/functional interactions suggests that physical interactions between the products of conserved genes play a part
in their co-evolution. Namely, to maintain the functionality of
an interaction, a change in one protein is likely to facilitate the
evolution of the proteins interacting with it, as has already
been shown [5]. Yet, as the magnitude of this correlation is
rather low, it is likely that other co-evolutionary forces play a
part in determining co-evolution, such as the sharing of common and varying growth environments during evolutionary
history.

which is a numerical classification scheme for enzymes based
on the chemical reactions they catalyze. By this classification,
the code of each enzyme consists of the letters 'EC' followed
by four numbers separated by periods. Those numbers represent progressively finer classifications of the enzyme. Thus, it
induces a functional distance. Our analysis shows that pairs
of orthologs with smaller functional distance (genes whose
first two roughest classification levels are identical) exhibit
higher levels of correlation between their rERP than other
pairs of orthologs (mean rERP correlation of 0.31 versus 0.27,
P = 1.23 × 10-7).

Co-evolutionary score and other properties of cellular functions and
SOGs
We did not find a parallel significant correlation between the
genomic co-localization of GO groups and their co-evolutionary score (see Materials and methods for a description of how
we computed the co-localization score of pairs of GO groups).
The co-evolution of genes and their chromosomal location are
not correlated even when considering each chromosome separately. Thus, we conclude that cellular functionality is a
more important force driving gene co-evolution than their
genomic organization.
The rERP measure correlates well with other systemic qualities such as genetic and physical interactions. The average
Spearman correlation between rERP levels of interacting proteins in the S. cerevisiae protein interaction network is 0.063,
which is 155 times higher than the average correlation (4.05 ×
10-4) for non-interacting proteins (P < 10-16). Proteins that are
part of a complex show a correlation of 0.05 between their
rERPs, 100 times higher than the average correlation for pro-

Clustering of co-evolutionary networks
We employed the PRISM algorithm [41] to partition each of
the three GO co-evolution networks (biological process, cellular component, molecular function) into clusters of nodes,
such that nodes from one cluster have similar sign connections (denoting positive or negative rERP correlations) with
nodes from other clusters. We focus here on biological processes at a significance cutoff value of P < 0.01 (Figure 10).
PRISM clusters the process terms into coherent groups in a
statistically significant manner (P < 0.001; see Materials and
methods), where most of the groups are enriched for particular types of processes: Cluster A7 contains many processes
related to DNA metabolism, chromatin formation and RNA
processing. This cluster shows strong negative correlations
with clusters A6 (amino acid biosynthesis, tricarboxylic acid
cycle, glucose oxidization and energy production) and cluster
A8 (protein processing and modification). It has also strong
positive correlations with cluster A4 (nuclear traffic and DNA
repair) and with cluster A5. We note that among the RNArelated processes in cluster A7, some (such as mRNA export
from nucleus and poly-A dependent mRNA degradation)
show R-type correlations with functions such as protein degradation via the multivesicular pathway. This relationship
points to a mode of evolution in which the two catabolic processes (protein and RNA) require coordination, so that
changes in one are dependent on preceding changes in the
other. Similarly, cluster A6 shows strong coordinated co-evolution with cluster A3 (amino acid and purine biosynthesis,
glucose oxidization, energy production and ribosome biology). Both clusters include GO functions related to the production of energy and, thus, coordinated evolution is
expected. An overview of the results shows that genes that
affect regulatory or information-related processes (DNA
metabolism, chromatin formation and RNA processing (cluster A7)) are 'master players'. These master genes/processes
exert reciprocal selection forces on many other metabolic
process (clusters A8, A3 and A6) and participate in the co-

Co-evolution of less conserved genes
The copy number pattern measure
The results presented above were focused on the analysis of a
conserved set of genes whose orthologs appear in all nine fungal species studied, comprising 1,372 SOGs and spanning a
total of 12,348 genes. The fungal dataset additionally includes
2,168 orthologous sets spanning more than 74,851 genes that
exhibit at least one change in their copy number along the
phylogenetic tree (and hence have undergone gene loss and/
or gene duplication events). The 'propensity for gene loss'
(PGL) [17] was shown to correlate with gene essentiality, the
number of protein-protein interactions and the expression
levels of genes. PGL has been used in methods for predicting
functional gene linkage [42,43], extending upon previous
methods that used the occurrence pattern of a gene in different organisms for the same aim [12-14]. Recently, a probabilistic approach related to the PGL was developed [42]. A
related measure, which is also based on a gene's phyletic pat-

tern (the occurrence pattern of a gene in different current
organisms), is phylogenetic profiling (PP) [15,16,43]. This
measure has been employed in previous small scale studies to
identify sets of genes with a shared evolutionary history [1215,43]. We describe a new measure of co-evolution that is a
generalization/unification of both PGL and PP, termed the
copy number pattern (CNP). Like PP, it characterizes each
gene by examining its phyletic pattern (but additionally takes
into account the number of paralogous copies of each gene in
the genome). Like PGL, it exploits the information embedded
in a species' phylogenetic tree to more accurately characterize
the evolutionary history of each gene (in comparison, PP carries out a similar computation based on just the phyletic pattern). We used the new CNP measure to analyze orthologous
sets that exhibit at least one change in copy number along the
analyzed phylogentic tree. This set of genes is, by definition,
not completely conserved, and complements the conserved
set of genes analyzed by the rERP measure.
Figure 11 provides a stepwise overview of CNP computation.
Steps A to F are essentially similar to those used to generate

relation that is higher (green colored edges, denoting coordinated relationships) or lower (red, denoting reciprocal
relationships) than the correlation values of X% of the total
GO pairs. We examined the networks formed under two edgeselection regimes, a more stringent one where X% = 99.9%
and a less stringent one where X% = 98%. The correlation
between the distance of GO groups in the network with X% =
99.9% and the distance of GO groups in the different GO
ontology networks is highly significant (r = 0.4209, P < 10-16)
for green, cooperative edges, and negatively correlated (r = 0.12, P < 0.04) for red, reciprocal edges. This suggests that
the two types of edges are informative: the green edges represent functional relationships while the red ones represent
pairs of GOs with distant functions.

the rERP (see Materials and methods): we first generate a set
of 2,168 orthologous sets that exhibit at least one change in
copy number along the analyzed phylogentic tree. We then
translate the resulting set of orthologs to copy numbers in
each organism (the number of paralogs in an organism), and
reconstruct the ancestral gene copy number using CAFE' [44]
(step F in Figure 11). Finally, using the copy number in each
internal node, we compute the change (the difference) in copy
number for orthologous sets along each edge (step G in Figure
11). The orthologous sets used for the rERP analysis and the
orthologous sets used for the CNP analysis include two different, exclusive groups of conserved versus less-conserved
genes, respectively. Analysis of these sets reveals that the first
group is enriched with metabolic processes while the second
is enriched with functional processes such as reproduction
and cell differentiation (Additional data file 6).

Co-evolution of less conserved genes with the copy number pattern
measure
Since changes in the copy number of genes are infrequent
events, the Spearman correlations between pairs of CNP vectors are usually very high (the average Spearman correlation
is 0.63). To overcome this, we generated CNP vectors of GO
processes (according to the biological processes ontology)
where the CNP of a GO category is the mean CNP of all the
genes it contains. These GO process vectors exhibit a wider
range of CNP values. Next, we constructed a GO process coevolution network. In this network two biological processes
are connected by an edge only if they manifest an extreme coevolution pattern - that is, if they have a Spearman rank cor-

Clustering of the copy number pattern evolutionary network
To learn more about the structure of the CNP co-evolution
network, we used the PRISM algorithm [41] (as in the case of
the rERP analysis) to partition each of the GO terms in the
less stringent network (X% = 98%; thus obtaining a larger
amount of edges and a more robust clustering) into clusters of
nodes, such that nodes from one cluster have similar color
edge connections with nodes from other clusters. PRISM is
able to separate the process terms into coherent groups
according to their mutual correlations, in a statistically significant manner (P < 0.001; see Materials and methods). Figure
12 displays the results of the PRISM analysis, clustering of the
GO biological processes into seven large groups. The seven
interconnected groups are enriched with specific processes,
and present clear interactions of the red and green edges. As
clearly seen in Figure 12, some clusters show mainly reciprocal co-evolution with most of the others (for example, clusters
B1 (fatty acid metabolism) and B6 (sugar metabolism). In
contrast, clusters B2, B3 and B7 (nuclear traffic, transcription
and DNA metabolism) show coordinated (C-type) co-evolution. Cluster B4 (protein modification, chromatin silencing)
shows C-type co-evolution with transcription (cluster B3) and
nuclear import (cluster B2) as well as DNA metabolism (cluster B7) but R-type relations with cluster B1, which includes
fatty acid metabolism and protein glycosylation.

Comparison of the co-evolution of conserved versus less-conserved
genes
A comparison between the results obtained by the rERP and
CNP methodologies at a global level should be done with
some caution, for three main reasons. First, these two measures are applicable for the analysis of completely disjoint,
complementary sets of orthologs. Second, the two methodologies measure different types of co-evolution. The rERP
measures evolution via amino acid substitutions while the
CNP measures co-evolution via changes in gene copy number,
which are mainly driven by gene gain and loss events. Thus,
third, these co-evolutionary relationships are possibly the
result of the action of different evolutionary forces. However,
it may be noted that some biological processes present the
same type of evolutionary relationship with both methods.

For example, DNA metabolism is always positively correlated
with nuclear traffic, transcription and vacuolar biology (ERGolgi traffic). Yet, some of the clusters exhibit different relationships when analyzed by the two measures. For example, a
cluster containing mainly genes labeled ribosome biology and
vacuolar biology exhibits reciprocal evolution with DNA
metabolism by rERP (clusters A3 to A7) but coordinated evolution by CNP (clusters B5 to B7). Thus, within a certain biological process, the evolutionary pressures exerted on highly
conserved genes may differ from those that apply to less conserved ones, and may thus provide different opportunities for
co-evolution.

Conclusions

localized manner on only three branches of the fungal tree is
in line with previous findings suggesting that a large fraction
of DNA mutations can be attributed to punctuated evolution
[4]. The fungal tree analyzed here is a natural starting point.
The future application of the approach presented here to
other phylogenetic trees, including the mammalian one,
holds much promise in characterizing the forces that shape
cellular co-evolution.

Materials and methods
Data sources
The GO functional classification used in this work is the most
comprehensive, qualitative, and widely used annotation database [45].

Our analysis charts the first global network view of the coevolution of conserved and less conserved genes in nine fungal species. We find that cellular functions play a more important driving force in gene co-evolution than the genes'
chromosomal location. Two fundamental patterns of co-evolution, cooperative and reciprocal, are defined, and, remarkably, we find that only genes co-evolving cooperatively
functionally back each other up. At the single gene level, the
observation that genes have evolved at accelerated rates in a

small (with less than five SOGs in our dataset). That is, the
main bulk of the analysis was performed across the whole GO

high-quality sequence. Furthermore, these species were analyzed recently by Man and Pilpel [33], serving as an appropriate reference set for studying evolutionary events in fungi.

The genetic interaction network data were downloaded from
the BioGrid database [47]; similar results were obtained
when the genetic interaction network of Tong et al. [38] was
used (data not shown). Recent work showed that only 5% of
the genetic interactions are conserved in S. cerevisiae and
Caenorhabditis elegans [48]. Note that the evolutionary distances between these species (1,542 million years, according
to [17]) are much larger than those between the organisms in
our dataset (20 to 837 million years). Further, C. elegans is
multi-cellular while all the analyzed fungi are unicellular.
Thus, it is not clear how the conclusions of Tischler et al. [48]
are related to our dataset.

Finally, due to the large evolutionary distance between S.
pombe and the hemiascomycotic species (350 to 1,000 million years ago [25]), this set of species present a nice distribution of evolutionary time. We believe that small changes in
the set of fungi species would likely yield quite similar results
(see details in Note 5 in Additional data file 2).

More importantly, in this work we study the relationship
between the genetic interaction network and its co-evolutionary network for one organism (S. cerevisiae) for which we
know the genetic interactions network. As there is no reason
to believe that this organism is 'special' in any way, we believe
that these findings are representative of the expected findings
for other organisms if or when their genetic interaction networks become known.
The protein interaction network of the budding yeast S. cerevisiae was downloaded from the BioGrid database [47].

ontologies [50]. EC numbers of the analyzed genes were
downloaded from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) [51].

Computing relative evolutionary rate patterns for
orthologous gene sets
The selection of species used here is not arbitrary; obviously,
different selections are perhaps equally plausible but several
considerations led us to the current selection, which we outline below. For this study, we used fungi whose genomes have
been completely assembled (at the time this study was performed: July 2007) according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and for which we could infer
the tRNA gene repertoire reliably and, thus, compute the
tRNA adaptation index (tAI). These include S. cerevisiae, C.
glabrata, K. lactis, D. hansenii, Y. lipolytica and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. This selection was then augmented by
three additional species: C. albicans, an important fungal
pathogen for which a high-quality gene collection (including
tRNA genes) has recently become available [52]; S. bayanus,
a Saccharomyces sensu stricto species that diverged from S.
cerevisiae approximately 20 million years ago and for which
an overwhelming majority of the open reading frames are
available [53]; and A. nidulans, a filamentous fungus with a

Volume 10, Issue 5, Article R48

Tuller et al. R48.13

The final dataset included genomes of nine fungal species: A.
nidulans, C. albicans, C. glabrata, D. hansenii, K. lactis, S.
bayanus, S. cerevisiae, S. pombe, Y. lipolytica.
Computation of the rERPs is a multi-step process (Figure 1
provides an overview), described in detail as follows. The phylogenetic tree used to analyze the data (Figure 2) was formed
according to the analysis of 18S rRNA data in [26], the analysis of 531 concatenated proteins [27], and the analysis of additional gene sets listed in [54] (step A in Figure 1). The
orthologous sets for the nine fungi were downloaded from
[33] (step B in Figure 1). This dataset was generated by the
MultiParanoid program [55]. We considered only sets that
include orthologs in all nine species. Sets of homologs that did
not include exactly one representative in each organism were
removed from our dataset to filter out paralogs and avoid
potential errors in evolutionary rate estimation due to duplication events (step C in Figure 1). Horizontal gene transfer
events (see, for example, [56]) are rare in fungi [35] and thus
were not considered in our analysis. The final dataset
included 1,372 orthologous sets. Stop codons were removed
and each gene was translated to a sequence of amino acids.
Each orthologous set was then aligned by CLUSTALW 1.83
[57] with default parameters. By using amino acids as templates for the nucleotide sequences and by ignoring gaps we
generated gap-free multiple alignments of the nine orthologous proteins in each orthologous set and their corresponding
coding sequences (step D in Figure 1).
Given the alignments of each set of orthologs and given the
phylogenetic tree, we used the codeml program in PAML for
the joint reconstruction of ancestral codons [58] in each of the
internal nodes of the phylogenetic tree (step E in Figure 1).
This reconstruction induced the sequence of ancestral proteins and their corresponding ancestral DNA coding
sequences. We hence obtained sets of 16 sequences; 9 from
the previous step (corresponding to the 9 leaves of the phylogenetic tree; Figure 2) plus 7 reconstructed sequences of the
internal nodes of the phylogenetic tree (ancestral nodes 10-16
in Figure 2). We denote such a set of 16 sequences a 'complete
ortholgous set'. For each complete ortholgous set, we computed the dN and dS in each branch of the evolutionary tree
using the y00 program in PAML [28,59] (step F in Figure 1).
The outputs of this stage are two vectors of 15 positive real
numbers for each complete ortholgous set (1,372 pairs of vec-

tors in our case). These vectors denote the dN and dS values
at the 15 different branches of the evolutionary tree.

tree. We perform the following steps. Step one: for each i and
j compute the average tAI for the sequences at the two ends of
the branch j; let tAIi, j denote this average. Step two: for each
branch j use all the tAIi, j and all the dSi, j (where 0 <i < 1,373)
and, by regression, estimate aj and bj that minimize the least
squares error of the model:

To adjust for selection on synonymous sites [60], we used a
procedure similar to that described in [29], utilizing the tAI
[61] instead of the codon adaptation index [33,62]. Following
Hirsh et al. [29], we assume the following model of evolution
on synonymous sites:

dS = (r0 + k × tAI )t
where r0 is the neutral evolutionary rate, k is a constant, and
t is time. Our goal is to estimate dS' = r0 × t, which is done
using regression. This requires the computation of the tAIs of
each of the gene sequences (the leaves of the phylogenetic
tree), and the estimation of the tAIs of the sequences at the
internal nodes of the phylogenetic tree. To this end (step G in
Figure 1) we used the tRNA copy number of each species as
reported in [33], and the ancestral tRNA copy numbers were
reconstructed following [44] (step I in Figure 1) using the
CAFÉ program.
The edge lengths (step H in Figure 1) for CAFÉ were computed by the following steps. Step one: we inferred edge
lengths under the molecular clock assumption for the tree
topology of Figure 2 and the concatenation of all the sets of
ortholog proteins (561,072 sites) using the codeml program in
PAML [59]. Step two: we normalized the log of branch lengths
to obtain branch lengths that are integers between 0 and
1,000 that reflect putative time units (this is the requirement
of the method of [44]. Step three: we used an expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm to find the optimal value of λ
(0.001756) for the model (see [44]).
It is important to note that by optimizing λ we actually optimize the likelihood of the model, and the result is invariant
for the choice of the normalization factor of the branch
lengths. The relatively similar tRNA copy number distribution of the nine species [33] also induces a quite similar tRNA
copy number distribution at the ancestral nodes of the phylogenetic tree. To compute the tAI of each complete orthologous set (step J in Figure 1), we used the Matlab, R, and Pearl
scripts from [61] (see [61] for the exact description of how to
compute the tAI).
Thus, by using tAI and dS we were able to adjust the dS values
for selection on synonymous sites, resulting in a new value,
dS'. This was done for each ortholgous set in each of the tree
branches (step K in Figure 1). These dS' values were used for
computing the corresponding values of adjusted evolutionary
rates, dN/dS'. As mentioned, the idea underlying this step
[29] is to assume a linear relationship between dS and tAI,
and its computation proceeds as follows.

Volume 10, Issue 5, Article R48

Tuller et al. R48.14

dS = b j + a j × tAI
Step three: for each i and j and an estimation of the substitution rate on synonymous sites dSi, j, the adjusted selection on
the synonymous sites is:

dS i’ , j = dS i , j − a j × tAI i , j
The final output of this procedure is a total of 1,373 vectors,
each with 15 dN/dS' values denoting the ERP values of each
complete orthologous set.
Usually, for very high levels of substitution rate (long
branches in the evolutionary tree), the error in the estimated
dS values increases [63]. This well known phenomenon is
named saturation. Thus, we perform an additional normalization of the dN values by computing the ranked evolutionary
rate, rER. The ranked evolutionary rate, rER (step L in Figure
1), is computed separately for each branch of the evolutionary
tree. For a given branch, the rank of the dN/dS' of a complete
ortholgous set among the dN/dS' values of all the complete
ortholgous sets is the number of sets that have lower dN/dS'
values in this branch (a number between 1 and the total
number of complete ortholgous sets, 1,373). The rERP of a
complete ortholgous set is the vector of its ranked evolutionary rate along the 15 branches of the evolutionary tree. Note 6
in Additional data file 2 and Additional data file 8 include a
comparison of the dN/dS' values to previous evolutionary
rate results in a previous study by Wall et al. [8].
The rERP developed and used in this work is different from
the measure used in [23] in many important ways. We ranked
the ER and adjusted the computed dN/dS for selection on
synonymous sites by using the tAI measure (an approach that
has not been used before). Additionally, we used the non-parametric Spearman correlation instead of the Pearson correlation. A comparison of the results obtained using our measure
with those obtained using Fraser et al.'s ER measure for studying co-evolution shows that the ratio between the average
correlation of physically interacting genes versus non interacting genes is very low when using Fraser et al.'s measure
(0.06/0.022 = 2.72), showing a very low discriminative
power. In comparison, the ratio obtained using our measure
is markedly higher (0.063/4.05 × 10-4 = 155), in correspondence with the expectation that interacting proteins would
tend to co-evolve much more than non-interacting ones (for
example, see [24]).

set, and let j (0 <j < 16) denote a branch in the phylogenetic

Measures that were based only on dN instead of dN/dS performed worse than the rERP mentioned above. Using dN
without ranking is problematic as longer branches have, in
general, higher dN and, thus, the correlations obtained were
very high and quite similar when comparing genes that physically interact and those that do not (r = 0.77 versus r = 0.73).

edges between the two clusters) in the original clustering to
its distribution in 1,000 randomly shuffled networks with
similar topological properties.

When we used ranked dN instead of ranked dN/dS, we
achieved better results, which were almost as good as the
results we got using rERP, in terms of separating pairs of
physically interacting from non-interacting proteins via their
co-evolution. For example, the ratio between the correlation
of protein-interacting to non-interacting proteins was 20
using ranked dN, weaker than the ratio of 155 observed using
rERP values.

Constructing and analyzing the co-evolution networks
of GO terms
The co-evolution network of GO terms was constructed as follows. First, consider only GO groups that include at least
three genes. Second, compute the rERP of each GO group.
Third, compute the Spearman correlation between the rERP
of all pairs of GO groups. Fourth, connect a pair of GO groups,
Gi and Gj, if the following two conditions are satisfied: condition one, they have significant correlation (P < 0.01 in the
case of the network in Figure 10), where significance is computed empirically versus a corresponding random shuffled
network; condition two, the two sets do not strongly overlap
in their gene content, having a Jaccard coefficient < 0.5 [64].
The distance between GO terms on the GO network was computed by replacing each directed edge in the original graph
with an undirected one, and computing the length of the minimal path between the two GO groups.
The co-evolution network was clustered and visualized using
the Matlab implementation of the PRISM algorithm [41]. The
PRISM algorithm was instrumental to our analysis as it partitions the graph according to the two types of edges (positive
(cooperative) or negative (reciprocal) rERP correlations) to
get clusters of nodes, such that nodes from one cluster have
edges of a similar type with nodes from other clusters. This is
of particular interest when studying co-evolution, since it
identifies 'monochromatic' relationships between groups of
genes/GO functions - that is, groups of genes that relate to
each other in either a completely cooperative or a completely
reciprocal manner. To the best of our knowledge, no other
method/algorithm is available to achieve this goal. Other
clustering algorithms do not preserve the 'monochromatic'
property and, hence, are not suitable for addressing the question at hand.
The significance of the monochromaticity of the resulting
clustering was computed by comparing the number of conflicts (the number of edges between nodes that are in different
clusters and have a color different from that of the majority of

Analyzing the genomic co-localization of GO terms
We define the distance between two GO groups as the median
of all shortest distances between each gene in one GO group
to each gene in the other GO group. We did not consider genes
that are common to the two GO groups. For estimating to
what extent two GO groups tend to be located close to each
other in the genome, we computed a P-value based on comparing their median distance to that of a background model
obtained by randomly locating all the genes of both groups in
the genome, and recomposing their median distance for each
such assignment (repeating this process 100 times to obtain a
distribution of background model medians). The P-value is
the fraction of times that a random shift yields a lower distance between the two GO groups.
