Hydrophobins from Aspergillus species cannot be
clearly divided into two classes
Britt G Jensen*, Mikael R Andersen, Mona H Pedersen, Jens C Frisvad, Ib Søndergaard

Abstract
Background: Hydrophobins are a family of small secreted proteins with a characteristic pattern of eight cysteine
residues found exclusively in filamentous fungi. They have originally been divided into two classes based on their
physical properties and hydropathy patterns, and are involved in the attachment of hyphae to hydrophobic
structures, the formation of aerial structures and appear to be involved in pathogenicity.
Findings: Analysis of nine genome sequences from seven Aspergilli revealed fifty hydrophobins, where each
species displayed between two to eight hydrophobins. Twenty of the identified hydrophobins have not previously
been described from these species. Apart from the cysteines, very little amino acid sequence homology was
observed. Twenty-three of the identified hydrophobins could be classified as class I hydrophobins based on their
conserved cysteine spacing pattern and hydropathy pattern. However twenty-six of the identified hydrophobins
were intermediate forms. Notably, a single hydrophobin, ATEG_04730, from Aspergillus terreus displayed class II
cysteine spacing and had a class II hydropathy pattern.
Conclusion: Fifty hydrophobins were identified in Aspergillus, all containing the characteristic eight cysteine
pattern. Aspergillus terreus exhibited both class I and class II hydrophobins. This is the first report of an Aspergillus
species with the potential to express both class I and class II hydrophobins. Many of the identified hydrophobins
could not directly be allocated to either class I or class II.

Background
Hydrophobins are a family of small proteins found
uniquely in filamentous fungi [1]. The currently characterised hydrophobins are approximately 100 AA in size
and have little amino acid sequence homology except
from eight conserved cysteines in a characteristic pattern [2,3]. The eight cysteines form four disulfide bonds
in the pattern Cys1-Cys6, Cys2-Cys5, Cys3-Cys4, Cys7Cys8 and especially the Cys3-Cys4 loop can vary considerably in length [4]. Based on their distinct hydropathy
patterns and physical properties, hydrophobins are traditionally divided into two classes [3]. Class I hydrophobins form highly insoluble membranes in water, organic
solvents and 2% SDS, while the membranes formed by
class II hydrophobins easily can be dissolved in aqueous
ethanol (60%) or 2% SDS [2]. Class I hydrophobins have
been identified in Ascomycetes and Basiodiomycetes,

while class II hydrophobins have only been identified in
Ascomycetes [1]. Typically, a single fungal species only
expresses either class I or class II hydrophobins, however previous studies have shown that few species have
the ability to express both class I and class II hydrophobins [5,6]. In class I hydrophobins the cysteine doublets
are followed by hydrophilic amino acids, while hydrophobic amino acids are observed after the cysteine
doublets in class II hydrophobins [2]. Furthermore, considerable variation is seen in the cysteine spacing of
class I hydrophobins, while less variation is seen for
class II hydrophobins [7]. In this study, we examine
nine full genome sequenced Aspergilli for new
hydrophobins.

Results and Discussion
Identification of hydrophobins

Nine full genome sequenced Aspergillus species were
used to search for new hydrophobins. A total of 50
potential hydrophobins were identified (Table 1) based
on the criteria of minimum eight cysteines, two cysteine

pairs, a size of app. 100 AA and the cysteine pattern. On
species level twenty of the identified hydrophobins have
not previously been mentioned in other studies, while
the number increases to thirty-one on strain level. The
number of identified hydrophobins within the species
varied from two to eight between the nine species. All
identified hydrophobins had theoretical signal sequences
and therefore have the possibility of being secreted.
They contain approximately 100 - 200 amino acids and
are 8 - 30 kDa in size. Furthermore, they contain eight
to ten cysteines, where excess cysteines (above eight)
are located before or after the conserved cysteine spacing pattern. Beauvais et al. (2007) have classified
AFUA_8G05890 and AFUA_5G01490 as hydrophobins.
As AFUA_8G05890 has 11 cysteines, no signal sequence
and both proteins lack the conserved cysteine pattern,
we disregard these proteins as hydrophobins as they do
not fulfil our criteria. Other Aspergillus hydrophobins
previously identified fulfilled the criteria [8-16] and have
likewise been found and included in this study.
Forty-five of the identified proteins contained domains
classifying them as hydrophobins by Pfam. The remaining five hydrophobins could not be classified. Four of
these (An01g10940, JGI35683, AN0940.2, AFLA_063080)
can be differentiated from the rest in displaying a distinctive cysteine pattern. They have a similar cysteine pattern
of CN{5-13}CCN{17}CN{7-12}CN{7}CCN{8-12}C (where
N signifies any other amino acid than cysteine) and
group together in the phylogenetic tree (Additional file
1), but still with other hydrophobins. They also have
hydropathy patterns that differ from both class I and
class II hydrophobins and can therefore theoretically not
be placed in either class. Furthermore, their hydropathy
patterns differ from each other, so they do not form a
new class either. The fifth hydrophobin (ATEG_10285)
differs in having a different cysteine spacing compared to
all other identified hydrophobins, but still clusters with
other hydrophobins in the phylogenetic tree (Additional
file 1). Forty-four of the identified hydrophobins displayed class I cysteine spacing pattern, but only twentyfour had a characteristic class I hydropathy plot resulting
in only twenty-three identified class I hydrophobins (see
Additional file 2 and Table 1). Only one identified hydrophobin displayed a characteristic class II cysteine spacing
pattern and had a class II hydropathy pattern, while the
rest (twenty-six) were intermediate forms. However, as
the majority of the identified hydrophobins have not physically been isolated and characterised, a differentiation
into type of class is only provisional. As many of the
identified hydrophobins displayed intermediate forms,
they may also exhibit solubility characteristics between
the two known classes. As these intermediate forms blur
the original classification, it could be speculated, whether

Page 3 of 6

an extension of the classical two class system would be in
place as more fungal genomes become available.
An examination of the multiple alignment (Additional
file 3) of the putative hydrophobins revealed very low similarity between the hydrophobins. Apart from the eight
cysteines a proline was observed in the majority of the
sequences (82%) situated in close proximity to the theoretical signal sequence cleavage site. This proline may be
involved in the correct cleavage of the signal sequence and
thereby influence the eventual secretion of the hydrophobins. Tryptophan is rarely seen in hydrophobins [2], and
only twelve of the identified hydrophobins from Aspergilli
contained between 1-5 tryptophan residues.
Several groups are revealed in the phylogenetic tree
(Additional file 1) and it seems that hydrophobins cluster
according to their cysteine spacing pattern. A common
feature in 44 of the 50 hydrophobins is a conserved spacing of five amino acids between the fifth and sixth
cysteines, while the remaining six hydrophobins contain
either seven or eight amino acids. This spacing of five
cysteines is also observed in other known class I hydrophobins (eg. SC3, EAS and MPG1) [7] and may be a
common feature in class I hydrophobins.
Previously Yang et al. (2006) [17] used primary structure analysis to identify new members of the hydrophobin family. By searching the Uniprot Knowledgebase
using the key word hydrophobin followed by a BLAST
against the NCBI database, Yang et al. retrieved several
sequences. However, by using the above mentioned
method putative hydrophobin sequences may be missed
as hydrophobins have high sequence diversity, and may
not resemble known hydrophobins sufficiently to be
picked up by a BLAST. In our search we found five
hydrophobins (An01g10940, JGI35683, AN0940.2,
AFLA_063080, ATEG_10285), which do not resemble
the other identified hydrophobins. If these hydrophobins
are used to conduct a BLAST, no known hydrophobins
appear in the results. So if the method described by
Yang et al. was used, these putative hydrophobins
would likely have been missed. Furthermore, Yang et al.
uses their identified sequences to create motifs, and
thereby identify nine new hydrophobins including five E.
nidulans (A. nidulans) hydrophobins. In our approach
we only sort our putative hydrophobins by the criteria
of size, number of cysteines and the eight cysteine pattern, thereby not eliminating any hydrophobins even if
they do not contain any common motifs.
Class I and class II hydrophobins of Aspergillus terreus

In Aspergillus terreus five different hydrophobins were
identified. ATEG_06492 displayed a characteristic class I
hydrophobin cysteine spacing pattern (CN{7}CCN{40}
CN{16}CN{5}CCN{17}C), whereas a class II hydrophobin

Jensen et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:344

spacing pattern was observed for ATEG_04730 (CN
{10}CCN{11}CN{16}CN{8}CCN{10}C). Comparison of
ATEG_06492 and ATEG_04730 to hydropathy patterns of
known class I and class II hydrophobins indicates that
A. terreus has genes for both class I and class II hydrophobins (Figure 1). The hydrophobins SC3 (Schizophyllum

commune), EAS (Neurospora crassa) and RodA (Aspergillus fumigatus) are known class I hydrophobins, where the
cysteine doublets are followed by a stretch of hydrophilic
amino acids. Likewise, the cysteine doublets in
ATEG_06492 are followed by a stretch of hydrophilic
amino acids contrasting ATEG_04730, where hydrophobic

cysteines are indicated by vertical lines. Hydrophobic amino acids are shown above the x-axis, while hydrophilic amino acids are shown below.
Only the part of the sequence from the first to the eighth cysteine was used to create the hydropathy pattern.

Jensen et al. BMC Research Notes 2010, 3:344
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/3/344

amino acids follow the cysteine doublets. Similarly, the
cysteine doublets are followed by hydrophobic amino
acids in the known class II hydrophobins HFBI and HFBII
from Trichoderma reesei. Therefore ATEG_06492 displays
a characteristic class I hydropathy pattern, while
ATEG_04730 displays a class II hydropathy pattern. Comparison of ATEG_04730 to class II hydrophobins HFBI
and HFBII showed 37% and 35% sequence identity, while
comparison to class I hydrophobins RodA, SC3 and EAS
showed 21%, 16% and 20% sequence identity. In contrast
ATEG_06492 showed 20% and 29% sequence identity to
class II hydrophobins HFBI and HFBII, but 51%, 21% and
24% to class I hydrophobins RodA, SC3 and EAS. Furthermore, a phylogenetic analysis (Figure 2) revealed that
ATEG_04730 clusters with HFBI and HFBI, while
ATEG_06492 clusters with RodA, EAS and SC3, strongly
indicating that ATEG_04730 can be classified as a class II
hydrophobin, while ATEG_06492 is classified as a class I
hydrophobin. As neither ATEG_06492 nor ATEG_04730
have physically been isolated or characterised, these can
obviously only tentatively be classified as a class I and a
class II hydrophobin respectively. This is the first report of
an Aspergillus species with the potential to express both
class I and class II hydrophobins.

Conclusion
Analysis of nine genome sequences from seven Aspergilli
revealed fifty hydrophobins, where each species displayed
between two and eight hydrophobins. Twenty of the identified hydrophobins have not previously been described
from these species. All identified hydrophobins contained
two cysteine pairs, were approximately 100-200 AA in
size, and displayed the common eight cysteine pattern.
Besides the cysteines, very little amino acid sequence
homology was observed. Twenty-three of the identified
hydrophobins could be classified as class I hydrophobins
based on their conserved cysteine spacing pattern
and hydropathy pattern, but the majority seem to be

intermediate forms. A single hydrophobin, ATEG_04730,
from Aspergillus terreus displayed a clear class II cysteine
spacing and had a class II hydropathy pattern. Furthermore, this hydrophobin grouped together with other
known class II hydrophobins in a phylogenetic analysis,
showing a close phylogenetic relationship to these. As
Aspergillus terreus also has the potential to express a class
I hydrophobin, this is the first reported case of an Aspergillus species with the potential to express both class I and
class II hydrophobins.

Methods
Availability of genomic data

The sequences of Aspergillus oryzae RIB40, Aspergillus
niger CBS 513.88, Emericella nidulans FGSC A4, Aspergillus fumigatus AF293, Aspergillus fumigatus A1163,
Aspergillus terreus NIH 2624, Aspergillus flavus NRRL
3357 and Aspergillus clavatus NRRL 1 were obtained
from the Central Aspergillus Data Repository (CADRE)
[18], while the sequence of Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015
was obtained from DOE Joint Genome Institute.
Identification of putative hydrophobins

A Perl program was constructed to search the nine
Aspergillus genomes for putative hydrophobins by identification of the common C..CC..C..C..CC..C cysteine
motif [2,3]. The identified putative hydrophobins were
further sorted for size and number of cysteine residues
resulting in fifty putative hydrophobins. The identified
putative hydrophobin sequences were used to conduct a
BLAST search against the NCBI (National Center for
Biotechnology Information) non-redundant (nr) database to differentiate between known and newly identified hydrophobins. The sequences were examined for
domains using Pfam to verify their function as hydrophobins [19] and the presence of and location of signal
peptide cleavage sites using SignalP 3.0 to examine their
theoretical ability to be secreted [20].

and HFBII (T. reesei) were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The phylogenetic tree was constructed based
on a multiple alignment of identified hydrophobins using Phylogeny.fr [22]. Branches with support values less than 50% were collapsed.

Protein sequence analysis

A multiple sequence alignment of the identified hydrophobin sequences was conducted using MUSCLE [21]
and based on this alignment a phylogenetic tree was
constructed [22-25].

Generation of hydropathy plots

Hydropathy patterns were determined using the hydropathy scale set by Kyte and Doolittle [26]. A nine amino
acid window was used and data was extracted using
Protscale on the ExPASy Proteomics Server [27]. The
hydropathy patterns were aligned around the cysteine
pairs placing gaps in the sequences where the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions alternate. Only the part of
the sequence from the first cysteine to the eight was
used for examining the hydropathy pattern.
