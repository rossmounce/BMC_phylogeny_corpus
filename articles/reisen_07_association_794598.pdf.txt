Abstract
Background: Myosins are molecular motors that carry cargo on actin filaments in eukaryotic cells.
Seventeen myosin genes have been identified in the nuclear genome of Arabidopsis. The myosin
genes can be divided into two plant-specific subfamilies, class VIII with four members and class XI
with 13 members. Class XI myosins are related to animal and fungal myosin class V that are
responsible for movement of particular vesicles and organelles. Organelle localization of only one
of the 13 Arabidopsis myosin XI (myosin XI-6; At MYA2), which is found on peroxisomes, has so
far been reported. Little information is available concerning the remaining 12 class XI myosins.
Results: We investigated 6 of the 13 class XI Arabidopsis myosins. cDNAs corresponding to the
tail region of 6 myosin genes were generated and incorporated into a vector to encode YFP-myosin
tail fusion proteins lacking the motor domain. Chimeric genes incorporating tail regions of myosin
XI-5 (At MYA1), myosin XI-6 (At MYA2), myosin XI-8 (At XI-B), myosin XI-15 (At XI-I), myosin
XI-16 (At XI-J) and myosin XI-17 (At XI-K) were expressed transiently. All YFP-myosin-tail fusion
proteins were targeted to small organelles ranging in size from 0.5 to 3.0 µm. Despite the absence
of a motor domain, the fluorescently-labeled organelles were motile in most cells. Tail cropping
experiments demonstrated that the coiled-coil region was required for specific localization and
shorter tail regions were inadequate for targeting. Myosin XI-6 (At MYA2), previously reported to
localize to peroxisomes by immunofluorescence, labeled both peroxisomes and vesicles when
expressed as a YFP-tail fusion. None of the 6 YFP-myosin tail fusions interacted with chloroplasts,
and only one YFP-tail fusion appeared to sometimes co-localize with fluorescent proteins targeted
to Golgi and mitochondria.
Conclusion: 6 myosin XI tails, extending from the coiled-coil region to the C-terminus, label
specific vesicles and/or organelles when transiently expressed as YFP fusions in plant cells. Although
comparable constructs lacking the motor domain result in a dominant negative effect on organelle
motility in animal systems, the plant organelles remained motile. YFP-myosin tail fusions provide
specific labeling for vesicles of unknown composition, whose identity can be investigated in future
studies.

Background
Intracellular motility of organelles and transport vesicles
is critical for optimization of photosynthesis and metabolism. The dynamic nature of mitochondria [1,2], chloroplasts [3], non-green plastids [4], peroxisomes [5,6], and
Golgi bodies [7] has been documented through chlorophyll or fluorescent protein labeling of the organelles.
Though inhibitor studies [5,6,8-10] indicate that the actin
cytoskeleton is important for motility of all of these
organelles, little information is available on the motor
proteins responsible for movement of particular cargoes
in plants.
Myosins are molecular motors carrying cargoes on actin
filaments in eukaryotic cells [11-13]. Myosins have three
common domains: a highly conserved motor domain
located at the N-terminus which interacts with actin and
hydrolyses ATP; an IQ domain which binds calmodulin
or calmodulin-related proteins; a tail which varies by
length and structure and which contains a coiled-coil
domain consisting of alpha-helices for protein dimerization [14]. When the Arabidopsis genome sequence became
available, a total of 17 myosin-like genes were identified
[15-17]. They fall into 2 classes: myosin class VIII containing 4 genes and myosin class XI containing 13 members
[15]. In the complete rice genome sequence, 2 class VI and
12 class XI myosins were detected [18]. Class VIII myosins
were predicted to be involved in new cell wall formation
and transport in the plasmodesmata [19], while class XI
myosins, which are closely related to animal and fungal
myosin class V [20], were considered likely to be involved
in vesicle and organelle movement.
There may actually be more than 13 myosin XIs present in
the Arabidopsis cell, as myosin genes are quite large, with
many exons and introns that might undergo alternative
splicing. In animals, alternative splicing allows the same
gene to encode different myosins that have different
cargo-binding capabilities [21]. In plants, myosin transcript data is still quite limited even in plant systems with
abundant genomic resources. That alternative splicing
does occur in plant myosin transcripts has recently been
shown by the sequencing of two cDNAs corresponding to
alternatively spliced transcripts of a single rice myosin XI
gene [18].
In order to investigate whether members of the myosin XI
gene family in plants localize to specific cargoes, we made
expression constructs in which the motor domain of the
myosin was replaced by yellow fluorescent protein (YFP).
We have examined the localization of 6 different YFPmyosin tail fusions expressed transiently, each encoded by
a different myosin XI gene. We have determined how
much of the tail region is required for specific labeling of
organelles and have evaluated the motility of the labeled

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/6

organelles. We have investigated whether any organelles
labeled with the YFP-tails co-localize with mitochondria,
plastids, peroxisomes, or Golgi.

Results and discussion
Fluorescent protein markers for transient expression
In order to examine possible localization of the YFP-tail
fusions to mitochondria, peroxisomes, and Golgi bodies,
we needed constructs expressing fluorescent proteins
known to localize to these compartments. Previously we
had shown that a yeast coxIV transit sequence fused to
GFP resulted in specific labeling of mitochondria [2]. For
specific labeling of Golgi bodies, we obtained the
ERD2::GFP construct that Boevink et al [22] used to
describe the remarkable motility of plant Golgi stacks. In
order to label perixosomes, we decided to make fusions of
a peroxisomal resident enzyme, catalase, which has the
uncleavable tripeptide of the PTS1 (Peroxisomal Targeting
Signal 1) at the C-terminus [23,24]. We produced N-terminal YFP or DsRed2 fusion genes with At catalase 2. After
transient
expression,
both
YFP::catalase2
and
DsRed2::catalase2 constructs did label peroxisomes in
onion cells (Figure 1A) as well as in tobacco leaves, as
expected (Figure 1B, C). The labeled peroxisomes exhibited motility [see Additional Files 1 and 2] similar to that
previously observed in Arabidopsis plants expressing the
PST1 signal fused to GFP [5,25].
YFP-class XI myosin-tail constructs label small plant cell
organelles
To obtain myosin tail sequences, cDNA for myosin XI-5
(At MYA1), myosin XI-6 (At MYA2), myosin XI-8 (At XIB), myosin XI-15 (At XI-I), myosin XI-16 (At XI-J) and
myosin XI-17 (At XI-K) was obtained from Arabidopsis
thaliana Columbia leaves by RT-PCR. Sequencing of two
cDNAs for each gene confirmed that the gene model in
Genbank was correct (data not shown). A few cDNAs
exhibited minor nucleotide alterations, likely PCR errors,
that did not affect the amino acid sequence. We did not
detect any alternative splicing; however, more thorough
studies using transcripts from a variety of tissues will be
needed to determine whether these genes' transcripts exist
in multiple forms.

Amino acid alignment of the predicted tail sequence from
the six cloned myosin tails shows a number of regions
with high sequence identity (Figure 2A). Five of the 6
myosins exhibit significant sequence identity in the socalled "dilute" domain. The tail of myosin XI-16 is the
shortest and lacks the dilute domain entirely (Figure 2A).
On a phylogenetic tree based on full length Arabidopsis
myosin alignments, Reddy and Day showed myosin XI-5
(At MYA1) and myosin XI-17 (At XI-K) are closely related
and myosin XI-6 (At MYA2) and myosin XI-8 (At XI-B)
also group together, while myosin XI-16 (At XI-J) and

myosin XI-15 (At XI-I) are more diverged [15]. When we
compare the amino acid sequences of the tail regions of
the 6 myosins we have investigated, we note that the same
two myosins within each of two pairs exhibit the highest
similarity to one another (Figure 2B). Myosin XI-15 is
more similar to the myosinXI-17/XI-5 pair than to the
other myosins (Figure 2B).
We designed YPF fusion constructs in Agrobacterium vector
pEarlygate 104 for each of the six myosin tails. The
myosin tail constructs were designed in such a way that
the N-terminal actin binding motor domain and the neck
domain containing the IQ motif would be missing and
replaced by the fluorescent protein. In melanocytes, comparable EGFP-tail fusions result in specific labeling of

melanosomes [26]. The tail region in our constructs starts
after the IQ motif and contains a coiled-coil region as well
as a "dilute" domain near the C-terminus. The constructs
were either transiently expressed in onion cells or in A.
thaliana leaves by bombardment, or in tobacco leaves by
agroinfiltration. 24 h after bombardment or 48 h after
Agrobacterium infiltration, a yellow fluorescent signal was
observed in the cells of the transformed tissues (Figure 3).
The fluorescent signal was present in small vesicular structures. While only a few such vesicles are evident in some
of the images of a single plane of the cell, they are quite
numerous in most cells, as can be seen in a full projection
view of several confocal z-stack sections from myosin XI5-tail expressing tobacco leaf cells (Figure 3A). The fluorescent vesicles vary in size, with measurements revealing

that they are between 0.5 – 3 µm in diameter. Thus their
size is in the same range as the size of Golgi, mitochondria
and peroxisomes, but smaller than chloroplasts and the
non-green plastids in onion epidermal cells.
Motility of compartments labeled with YFP-tail fusions
The labeled vesicles were observed to be motile in most
cells examined [see Additional files 3, 4, 5, 6]. In other systems, expression of defective myosins lacking a functional
motor domain results in cessation of movement of the
normal cargo carried by the particular myosin, a dominant negative phenotype [27]. Evidently the abnormal
YFP-tail myosin is not able to affect the function of a
motor that can operate on the fluorescent organelle. If the
fusion protein is unable to dimerize with an endogenous
myosin and thereby destroy its function, then motility
would be expected. Perhaps, unexpectedly, the fusion protein cannot dimerize with its homologous wild-type
myosin through the coiled-coil domain but is still able to
bind a cargo. The number of molecules of YFP-myosin
present through transient expression may not be high
enough to dimerize with most wild-type myosins to create
a dominant-negative effect. Alternatively, the YFP-truncated myosin may be interacting with subcellular structures to which the wild-type myosin does not normally
adhere. Another explanation is that that more than one
class XI myosin is responsible for moving the same cargo.
A further possible reason for the continued movement of
the unidentified vesicles is that other motors move the
same vesicle on microtubules; use of both the microfilaments and microtubules for motility has been reported for
both Golgi stacks [28] and chloroplasts [9]. In animals,
melanosomes are moved by both microtubule and actin
motors [29]. However, the mobility of plant peroxisomes
is prevented by actin and myosin inhibitors [5,6], so the
continued movement of these organelles cannot be
explained by use of microtubule motors.

The average speed of the mobile vesicular structures and
the length of the average track on which the organelles
move differs depending on cell type and particular YFPmyosin expressed (Figure 4). The onion epidermal cells
are larger and more elongate in shape that most mesophyll cells, and it is evident that peroxisomes exhibit a
greater speed and track length in the non-green epidermal
vs. green leaf cells. The difference in average organelle
track speed in mesophyll cells exhibited by structures
labeled by YFP-myosin XI-6 vs. XI-15 and XI-17 suggests
that the populations of organelles labeled by these three
myosins are not identical. It is clear that all these populations exhibit higher mobility and track length than vesicular structures exhibiting Brownian movement (Figure 4).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/7/6

Determining class XI myosin domains and tail lengths
sufficient for targeting
In order to determine which myosin tail length would be
sufficient for labeling of discrete structures, we designed
four different constructs varying by their length (Figure 5).
The constructs start either 1) at the half coiled-coil region,
or 2) just after the coiled-coil region, or 3) at the half
length of the tail, or 4) just before the "dilute" domain.
The C-terminus was kept intact in the deletion constructs
because studies have shown that mouse MyoVa lacking
the C-terminus was unable to co-localize with melanosomes in melanocytes [21]. The amino-acid position of
each domain was obtained by searching the Pfam database [30]. Deletion constructs were made for Myosin XI-5
(At MYA1), Myosin XI-6 (At MYA2), Myosin XI-15 (At XII) and Myosin XI-17 (At XI-K).

After agroinfiltration, no major organelle targeting was
obtained with any YFP-dilute construct (Figure 6O–R) as
compared to full-length tail constructs (Figure 6A–D). The
fluorescent signal with the globular dilute domain constructs was primarily in the cytoplasm. Proteins expressed
from C half-tail fusion constructs also were usually not
specifically targeted to organelles (Figure 6K–N). Sometimes a few punctate structures were labeled (Figure 6K,
6M), but the labeled entities did not move as freely as
those observed after labeling with the complete tail constructs (data not shown). Myosin XI-6 and XI-17 YFP
fusions without the coiled-coil domain were usually able
to label vesicles (Figure 6H–J), but myosin XI-15 (At XI-I)
without the coiled-coil region resulted in unspecific cytoplasmic labeling (Figure 6I). While myosin XI-5 and
myosin XI-6 YFP fusions lacking half the coiled-coil
region still labeled vesicles (Figure 6B, 6C), myosin XI-15
YFP 1/2-tail fusions resulted in only labeling of vesicles in
very few cells (Figure 6G). For myosin XI-15, evidently the
complete coiled-coil domain is necessary for targeting to
a cargo. As observed with the full-length YFP-tail fusions,
movement of the organelles occurred when they were
labeled with half-coil and no-coil constructs [see Additional file 7].
Comparison of the labeled compartments to Golgi,
mitochondria, and peroxisomes
While the shape and size of the labeled structures following transient YFP-tail expression eliminated chloroplasts
and non-green plastids from further consideration, the
labeled structures were in the size range of Golgi bodies,
mitochondria or peroxisomes. We transiently coexpressed fluorescent proteins known to label these compartments in order to determine whether any myosin XIlabeled compartments corresponded to these 3 organelle
types. We expressed either the catalase::DsRed2 construct
for peroxisomes, coxIV::GFP [2] for mitochondria, and
ERD2::GFP [22] for Golgi labeling. Figures 7, 8, 9 show

the result of the co-localization experiments for the six
studied myosins.
For Myosin XI-6, the "nocoil" construct was expressed
rather than the full tail region, because for unknown reasons, the shorter construct produced more consistent
labeling. YFP::Myosin XI-6-nocoil (Figure 7B) co-localized with the peroxisomal catalase::DsRed2 marker but
not with the mitochondrial or Golgi body marker. The
YFP::Myosin XI-5-tail (Figure 7A), YFP::Myosin XI-8-tail
(Figure 8A) and YFP::Myosin XI-15-tail (Figure 8B) do not
co-localize with any of the markers. YFP::Myosin XI-16tail did not co-localize with the peroxisome marker, but
slight overlaps were observed with the mitochondrial and
Golgi markers (Figure 9A). We did not detect any conclu-

sive co-localization with any marker for YFP::Myosin XI17-tail (Figure 9B), though occasionally there were a few
slight overlaps with Golgi stacks.
The co-localization of YPF::myosin XI-6-nocoil confirms
the finding that this myosin interacts with peroxisomes, as
previously reported in studies using anti-MYA2 (XI-6)
antibodies in transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing a
GFP-tagged peroxisomal targeting signal peptide [31].
None of the other five myosin constructs tested co-localized with this peroxisome marker. The overlap of the signal of YFP::myosin XI-16-tail with the Golgi and
mitochondrial markers is suggestive but not entirely conclusive, because YFP and GFP are difficult to separate due
to overlapping excitation peaks. Further studies with addi-

Rather few punctuate structures were observed in cells with 1/2 tail or dilute constructs. n/d = not determined. Bar = 10 µm.

tional control fluorescent protein fusions need to be
undertaken in order to verify whether YFP::myosin XI-16
interacts with Golgi bodies and mitochondria. Nevertheless, our experiments do show that motile vesicles are
reproducibly labeled with myosin YFP-tail fusions. The
identity of these vesicles can be further probed in the
future through co-localization with proteins and dyes
known to label various compartments involved in vesicular transport processes.
Occasional labeling of linear structures
Instead of the reproducible organelle labeling seen in
most experiments, on rare occasions we observed long fil-

amentous structures with the characteristic appearance of
actin filaments (Figure 10A, 10C). The linear structures
were similar to actin microfilaments found in GFP-FABD2
expressing Arabidopsis seedlings [32] or GFP-talin cells
[33]. Such labeling was unexpected because the actinbinding motor domain is missing in the fusion proteins.
However, if heterodimerization between the YFP::myosintail fusions and endogenous myosins sometimes occurs,
then perhaps the myosin heterodimer could interact with
actin filaments, resulting in labeling. Perhaps the rare cells
giving filamentous structures were expressing unusually
high amounts of the YFP-tail fusion proteins. Because the
proteins are being expressed transiently from T-DNA fol-

lowing agroinfilitration, different cells are likely to accumulate different amounts of the YFP-myosin proteins.
Not all linear structures appeared similar to microfilaments. Sometimes we observed short linear structures
(Figure 10B, 10D) that appeared more similar to microtubules than microfilaments [34]. Usually a myosin would
not be expected to react with microtubules. However,
there is evidence that motors sometimes link the actin and
tubulin cytoskeleton. The Drosophila myosin VI interacts
with a microtubule plus-end-binding protein [35,36].
Even though peroxisomes move on microfilaments [37],
the plant peroxisomal multifunctional protein was shown
to bind cortical microtubules in vitro, and peroxisomes
and microtubules were observed to interact [38]. In CHO
cells, peroxisome association with microtubules was also
described [39]. Thus, for unknown reasons, perhaps the
myosin XI YFP-tail constructs can sometimes interact with
microtubules.

Conclusion
Six different fluorescent myosin XI-tail fusion proteins can
label small vesicular structures. Of the 6 fusion proteins
analyzed, only YFP::myosin XI-6 evidently interacts with
peroxisomes. Most of the C-terminus past the motor
domain and IQ repeats was necessary for the myosin to be
targeted to an organelle. N-terminal deletions past the
coiled-coil region results resulted in loss of specific labeling of vesicles. Unlike in animal systems, the defective
myosins did not disrupt motility of the labeled organelles.
Either the YFP-myosins can bind to organelles not usually
mobilized by the corresponding normal myosins, were
not present in adequate concentrate to saturate the normal myosin subunits, or there is redundancy in the motor
machinery that is responsible for intracellular trafficking.

Methods

PCR products were cloned into a pCR2.1-TOPO T/A vector (Invitogen) and sequenced. Cloned myosin tails and
cropped tail constructs were further PCR amplified with
primers (Table 1) allowing GATEWAY directional cloning
using AccuPrime™ Pfx DNA Polymerase (Invitogen). PCR
products were cloned into a pENTR/D TOPO vector (Invitrogen), and LR clonase reactions between the entry vectors and the destination vector pEarleyGate104 [40] were
performed according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). pENTR/D vectors containing the genes of interest were digested with MluI prior the LR reaction.
At Catalase 2 cDNA (At4g35090) was obtained by RT-PCR
using
the
following
primer
pairs:
5'ATGGATCCTTACAAGTATCGTC3'
and
5'CTAGATGCTTGGCCTCACG3'. The PCR product was
cloned into a pCR2.1-TOPO T/A vector (Invitogen), and
sequenced. The gene was then amplified with the following primers for allowing a directional cloning into the
pENTR/D
TOPO
vector
(Invitrogen):
5'CACCGATCCTTACAAGTATCGTC3'
and
5'TTAGATGCTTGGTCTCACG3'. The gene was fused to
YFP in the pEarleyGate104 [40] by LR reaction (Invitrogen). The catalase cDNA was also fused downstream of
DsRed2 in the binary pGDR vector [41] by using the KpnI
restriction site. Primers containing KpnI restriction sites
(bold) were used: 5'GGGGTACCATGGATCCTTACA3'
and 5'GGGGTACCTAGATGCTTGGTC3'. The purified
PCR product was digested by KpnI and cloned into the
KpnI linearized and dephosphorylated pGDR vector using
T4 ligase (Invitrogen). Positive clones were screened by
digestion profile and confirmed by sequencing.
Sequence alignment and cladogram for myosin tails
Myosin tail sequences were aligned by using MultAlign
[42], and edited with GeneDoc [43]. Coiled-coil regions
were predicted with COILS [44] in the SMART module
[45,46] and "dilute" domains were identified with Pfam

[30]. Amino acid similarity tree (cladogram) was made in
Megalign (DNAStar) with the Clustal W method.
Transient expression
Onion cells or Arabidopsis thaliana leaves were bombarded
with plasmid-coated tungsten particles using a Model PDS
1000/He Biolistic Particle Delivery System™ (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions.
Plasmid DNA (2 µg for each shot) was precipitated on
tungsten particles, and onion or A. thaliana epidermal
cells were bombarded twice. The expression was observed
24 h after bombardment.

Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression was performed as previously described [47]. Briefly, the binary
GATEWAY-plasmid vectors were transformed by electroporation into A. tumefaciens strain C58C1 carrying the virulence helper plasmid pCH32 [48]. The transformants
were inoculated into 5 ml LB medium supplemented with
50 µg ml-1 kanamycin and 5 µg ml-1 tetracycline and
grown at 28°C overnight. Cells were precipitated and
resuspended to an OD of 0.5 in solution containing 10
mm MgCl2, 10 mm MES pH 5.6 and 150 µm acetosyringone. The cells were left at room temperature on the
bench for 2 h before infiltration into N. bentamiana leaves.
Observation was done 48 h after infiltration.

Confocal laser scanning microscopy
Confocal microscopy was performed on a Leica DMRE-7
(SDK) microscope equipped with a TCS-SP2 confocal
scanning head (Leica Microsystems Inc., Bannockburn, IL,
USA). Images were collected with a Leica 63 × HCX PL
APO water immersion objective (NA = 1.20). YFP was
excited at 514 nm with an ArKr laser, and emission was
detected between 525 and 625 nm. Chlorophyll was
excited at 488 nm with an ArKr laser and emission was
detected between 640 and 715 nm. DsRed was excited at
514 with an ArKr laser or at 543 nm with a GreNe laser
and emission was detected between 563 and 660 nm. GFP
was excited at 488 with an ArKr laser and emission was
detected between 498 and 515 nm. For co-localization
experiments, images were sequentially collected in order
to minimize cross-talk of GFP and YFP. For time lapse
series YFP and chlorophyll were both excited at 488 nm
and pictures were collected without frame averages.
Organelle motility was measured with the ImarisTrack
module from the Image Analyzing Software Imaris 5.0
(Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland). Labeled organelles
were detected with the spot function and tracks were analyzed by using the autoregressive motion algorithm.
Brownian movement was tracked with the Brownian
motion algorithm.
