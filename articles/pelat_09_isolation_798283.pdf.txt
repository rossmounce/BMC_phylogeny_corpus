Abstract
Background: Ricin is a lethal toxin that inhibits protein synthesis. It is easily extracted from a
ubiquitously grown plant, Ricinus communis, and thus readily available for use as a bioweapon (BW).
Anti-ricin antibodies provide the only known therapeutic against ricin intoxication.
Results: In this study, after immunizing a non-human primate (Macaca fascicularis) with the ricin
chain A (RTA), a phage-displayed immune library was built (2 × 108 clones), that included the λ light
chain fragment. The library was screened against ricin, and specific binders were sequenced and
further analyzed. The best clone, 43RCA, was isolated using a new, stringent neutralization test.
43RCA had a high, picomolar affinity (41 pM) and neutralized ricin efficiently (IC50 = 23 ± 3 ng/ml,
corresponding to a [scFv]/[ricin] molar ratio of 4). The neutralization capacity of 43RCA compared
favourably with that of polyclonal anti-deglycosylated A chain (anti-dgRCA) IgGs, obtained from
hyperimmune mouse serum, which were more efficient than any monoclonal at our disposal. The
43RCA sequence is very similar to that for human IgG germline genes, with 162 of 180 identical
amino acids for the VH and VL (90% sequence identity).
Conclusion: Results of the characterization studies, and the high degree of identity with human
germline genes, altogether make this anti-ricin scFv, or an IgG derived from it, a likely candidate for
use in humans to minimize effects caused by ricin intoxication.

Background
Ricin, a 60 to 65 kDa glycoprotein derived from beans of
the castor plant (Ricinus communis), is a lectin and member of the A-B toxin family. The B-chain carries the lectin
function and binds to specific sugar residues of the target
cell surface, allowing ricin to be internalized by endocyto-

sis [1]. The A-chain (RCA-A) has RNA N-glycosidase activity, removing a highly conserved adenine residue in the
sarcin/ricin loop of 28S rRNA. The RNA depurination in
the ribosome inhibits docking of elongation factor 2, and
prevents attachment of amino acids to the polypeptide
chain. The result is irreversible inhibition of protein syn-

thesis and eventual cell death [2]. Ricin is on the second
priority list of the CDC and is regarded as a high risk for
being utilised as a bioweapon.
Ricin is hydrosoluble and, with an estimated LD50 by
ingestion of 1 mg/kg in humans, may potentially be used
to contaminate food or beverages (reviewed in [3]). Oral
intoxications with ricin are encountered in medicine, as
accidents usually involving small children, and in suicide
attempts among adults. Eight, well-chewed castor beans
may be fatal to a 70 kg adult [4]. Ricin administered
parenterally to mice has a LD50 of 5 – 10 μg/kg body
weight [5]. The toxin has also been administered parenterally to humans, with the most famous case being that of
Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian dissident, allegedly killed
with ricin in London [6]. Ricin has also been involved in
an assassination attempt in Paris [7]. Although oral and
parenteral intoxication have been problematic, the intoxication route most feared and the one that causes the most
harm, is the pulmonary route. Pulmonary intoxication of
ricin shares the same LD50 as the parenteral route [8], but
an aerosol delivery can disperse ricin over a larger population and result in damage to many more individuals than
stabs in the arm or leg.
Ricin can be produced by individuals using basic equipment and a rudimentary knowledge of chemistry [9].
Since Ricinus communis has a world-wide distribution and
many plants are grown for decorative purposes, collecting
castor bean seeds provides a ready source for toxin production. R. communis is also cultivated in the fields to
extract, on an industrial scale, castor oil that is used in the
chemical industry. By weight, the mash, a side product of
oil extraction, can be 1 to 5% ricin. During World War II,
large scale production of ricin resulted in the "W" bomb
[10]. During the early 1980s, weaponization of ricin
occurred in certain states despite being forbidden by international treaties [11].
Until recently, diagnostic and therapeutic tools for identifying ricin intoxication via the lung were not available [3].
This need led our team to develop the first para-clinical
test for the diagnosis of pulmonary intoxication caused by
ricin [12]. Since then, other investigators have isolated
single-domain antibodies in hopes of developing automated detection systems useful for ricin diagnostics [13].
Regarding therapeutics, sophisticated approaches tested
thus far have failed to produce synthetic molecules effective for treatment of pulmonary ricin intoxication [14,15].
Additionally, following efforts to produce vaccines inducing neutralizing antibodies against this toxin, two vaccines are under trials but such vaccines may only partially
reduce lung damage caused by the aerosolised form of
ricin [16]. Previous studies using anti-ricin antibodies of
animal origin have, however, shown that these IgGs, in

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/60

particular when aerosolised, are efficacious in animal
models of ricin pulmonary intoxication [17-19]. Thus, at
the present time, anti-ricin antibodies provide the primary
therapeutic available for ricin intoxication.
Recombinant anti-ricin antibodies should prove useful
for both prophylactics and therapeutics in humans. So far
however, development of antibodies for human use have
only yielded, in a Chinese laboratory, one chimeric antibody thus composed of murine variable regions and
human constant regions [20]. This antibody, belonging to
a first generation of recombinant antibodies, would very
likely induce adverse side effects (HACA, i.e. Human Anti
Chimeric Antibodies) and have poor tolerance in vivo, due
to its murine component. In the present study we isolated,
from a non-human primate (NHP) immune library, a
human-like scFv, 43RCA, that neutralized ricin very effectively and had a very high affinity for RCA. This affinity is
amongst the highest reached for scFvs isolated from any
library, without in vitro affinity enhancement. In particular, the antibody affinity is approximately 100 times better
than previous antibody fragments obtained with the same
technique [21-23]. The NHP antibody fragments, like
43RCA, are very similar to their human counterparts, and
suitable for "germline humanizing" (or "super-humanizing") [24] in order to ensure their excellent tolerance.

Results
Animal immunization
One male macaque was immunised with the A chain of
ricin (RCA-A). After five RCA-A injections, the ELISA titre
towards whole ricin as an antigen, was equal to 250 000.
Library construction and isolation of scFv specific for ricin
The fifth (last) boost was given eight months after the
fourth RCA-A injection. Three days before the boost, no
PCR products could be obtained from the bone marrow
using our primers. Amplification was only possible after
the last boost and these products were thus regarded to
probably code specifically for RCA-A specific antibodies.
More precisely, three days after the fifth boost, amplification was detected with 7 of the 9 pairs of primers utilized
for amplifying DNA encoding the VH fragment, and with
all (7) primer pairs utilized for VLκ. The most diverse
DNA was obtained on days 7 and 10, when all pairs of
primers strongly amplified DNA that then declined on the
14th day (6) pairs positive for VH and for VLκ). The VLλ
primers were tested later using the cDNA originating from
the seventh day and MHVL1-f1, MHVL1-f2, MHVL2-f1,
MHVL3-f1, MHVL4-f2 and MHVL9/10 (table 1) allowed
DNA amplification. All the PCR products amplified from
the cDNA obtained on the 7th day were precloned into
pGemT, in order to obtain sub-libraries of 7.104, 4.104,
and 4.103 clones for the DNA coding the VH, the VLκ or
VLλ fragments respectively. The scFv libraries were constructed in pHAL14 using two cloning steps, starting indePage 2 of 13

pendently with the VLκ or VLλ sub-libraries. Sizes of the
final scFv libraries were 9.4 × 107 clones for the κ and 8 ×
107 clones for the λ libraries, respectively containing
approximately 75% and 95% full-size inserts as determined by colony PCR. Both antibody gene libraries were
packaged with Hyperphage and yielded a good scFv surface presentation determined by SDS-PAGE, western blot
and anti-pIII immunostain (data not shown). Both libraries were pooled for panning.
Isolation of anti-ricin scFvs
While the library was obtained from a macaque immunized with the RCA-A, it was panned with ricin since the
whole toxin was our final target molecule. During panning, the number of eluted phages rose from 105 (first
round of panning), to 5 × 105 (second round) and finally
to 5 × 106 phages (third and last round). This increase typically indicated enrichment in phages interacting specifically with the antigen. A phage-ELISA utilising ricin and
RCA-A as antigens was performed to assess reactivity of
the selected phages. Before panning, the signals on both
antigens were at the background level, and both signals
increased to five-fold over background after the first and
the second rounds of panning. According to the phage
technology, such signal increases correspond to enrichment in high-affinity binders. After a third round, the signal on RCA-A further increased as expected and it was 15fold higher than the background, and 25-fold higher on
ricin, which would be in agreement with the fact that
whole ricin had been utilized for panning. The phagemidic DNA was extracted from the library after its third
round of panning, and transformed into E. coli HB2151
[25]. Fifty clones were isolated and each monoclonal
phagemidic DNA was extracted for sequencing. In parallel, these clones were induced for expression.

Ricin neutralization in cell-based assays, scFv stability
Of the 50 clones isolated after the panning, only 19 possessed full-sized, non-redundant sequences that were
expressed for further testing in vitro. At the highest scFv
concentration (1 μg/ml), clone 9RCA showed only 30%
inhibition of cellular toxicity even though the molar ratio
[scFv 9RCA]/[ricin] was in 150-fold excess. All other
clones had neutralizing properties either equal, or less
than, clone 9RCA. Exceptions included clones 43RCA,
38RCA, and 44RCA only. By using the cell-based assay,
the IC50 of clone 44RCA was 484 ± 10 ng/ml and that of
clone 38RCA, 93 ± 5 ng/ml. The best clone, 43RCA, had
an IC50 equal to 23 ± 3 ng/ml (Figure 1), representing a
molar ratio [43RCA]/[ricin] equal to 4. This clone was sufficiently expressed (around 100 μg/culture liter) to allow
further study.

In order to determine scFv stability, the scFvs were incubated in culture media for 24 h (37°C). The reactivity of
clones 43RCA, 44RCA, and 38RCA was not affected by
incubation as assessed by ELISA. The stability of these
three scFvs generally differed from other scFvs that
showed less neutralization capacity, as the latter lost
between 0 and 75% of their ability to bind toxin in an
ELISA after they were exposed to the same conditions.
Ricin neutralization in cell-free assays
In order to appreciate whether anti-ricin scFv could function as an effective therapeutic against ricin intoxication,
43RCA was tested for its ability to neutralize ricin biological activity using a cell-free translation assay. The scFv
43RCA neutralized 89% of ricin activity at 40 μg/ml, and
even concentrations of 2 μg/ml neutralized 60% of ricin
activity when compared to controls containing ricin only
(Figure 2). 1.5 μg/ml of 43RCA (50 nM) neutralized 50%

of the activity of ricin, present at a 4 nM concentration in
this assay, thus the corresponding molar ratio [43RCA]/
[ricin] is equal to 12, in the same order of magnitude than
for the cell-based assay (4). The activity of 43RCA was
compared with the neutralizing capacity of anti-ricin IgGs
purified by protein A from sera of mice hyper-immunised
with the deglycosylated ricin A chain (anti-dgRCA), the
most neutralizing antibodies available to us. By using the
same concentrations, the anti-dgRCA IgGs showed ~20%
neutralization at 5 μg/ml, and none at 2 μg/ml. The
molecular weight of a scFv is 25 kDa with one paratope,
while the molecular weight of an IgG is 150 kDa with two
paratopes. As a consequence, the molecular weight of a
paratope in the form of an IgG is three times larger than
that of a scFv, and an IgG concentration of 5 μg/ml represents approximately the same molar paratope concentration as the scFv concentration at 2 μg/ml. At this same
concentration of paratopes, the scFv neutralizes ricin three
times more efficiently than the polyclonal IgG.
Affinity determination
Affinity measurements focused on the best neutralizing
scFvs. The affinity of 43RCA against ricin was initially
evaluated in standard conditions, using ~600 seconds elution steps, and resulting in an excellent affinity of approximately 40 pM. The KD of 38RCA measured under the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/60

same conditions yielded 60 pM. In contrast, the affinity of
44RCA was 4.9 nM, or 100-fold less favourable, although
considered high in absolute terms. Because 43RCA neutralisation activity was four times higher than 38RCA, we
focused our work upon this more efficient scFv. A more
precise measurement of 43RCA's affinity, performed by
lengthening the elution time and by using a small scFv
immobilization level (100 RU) (Figure 3), gave values of
40.8 pM after a 3 hr elution and 40.9 pM after a 4 hr elution. Measured after a 4 hr elution step, the Kon was equal
to 3.34 105 M -1 S -1 and the Koff, 1.36 10-5 s-1. The quality
of these affinity measurements was assessed by the internal consistency test, which had numerical values of 0.56
(3 hr elution measurement) and 0.626 (4 hr elution measurement) when these values have to be inferior to 3 for the
measurements to be valid.
Computational analysis
Of the 50 isolated clones, only 24 full-sized sequences
coding for scFvs could be obtained. On these sequences, 3
were present in 2 occurrences (6 RCA and 37 RCA, 13 RCA
and 32 RCA, 14 RCA and 44 RCA) and one was present in
3 occurrences (34 RCA, 41 RCA, 42RCA). Such repetitions
may be informative since they could signal scFvs selected
due to their high affinity, as was the case with 44RCA. The
19 non-redundant sequences coding the VH and VL

at 37°C. Values were calculated as the % control [(CPS treated sample/CPS untreated, no ricin control) × 100]. Results represent the average ± S.D. for three individual experiments.

found most similar to these 19 sequences, are shown on
tables 2 and 3. In parallel, those sequences were analysed
using a new online tool http://www.phylogeny.fr/, and
this analysis was presented in the form of a phylogenetic
tree (Figure 4). The initial root of the tree separated the
scFvs in two sub-trees, corresponding to two clusters.
Cluster A, corresponding to the sub-tree presented on the
upper part of the figure, comprised three subgroups (scFvs
48 RCA, 11 RCA, 34 RCA, 9 RCA, 47 RCA; scFvs 13 RCA,

30 RCA; scFvs 37 RCA, 7 RCA, 15 RCA), whose light
chains were of the λ isotype. The 13RCA and 30RCA pair
differed only by two nucleotides (A/G41 located in the
middle of FR1; and T/C116, the first residues of FR2) and
probably resulted from the same parental IgG by somatic
hypermutations, which did not lead to a significantly better neutralization effect. Beside their VLλ, 13 RCA and 30
RCA were not related to the rest of cluster A, and were
removed from the remainder of the study. Analysis of the
[V, (D) and J] genes arranged to code for the 6 remaining
scFvs composing cluster A permitted an evaluation of its

diversity. Typically, the VH of these scFvs were coded by a
unique combination of a single IGHV gene (IGHV4-b) rearranged with a single IGHD gene (IGHD2-8) and with a
single IGHJ gene (IGHJ4) (tables 2 and 3), except for one
occurrence in IGHV4-34 (scFv 9RCA) and two occurrences in IGHD1-7 (scFv 37RCA and 48RCA) combined
with IGHJ5. The VL of these 6 scFvs were coded by IGLV136 and IGLV3-21 on three occurrences each, while
another IGLV gene (IGLV1-47) was used twice. The IGLJ
genes coding VL were rather constant, with IGLJ1 genes on
six occurrences, in addition to one using of IGL3 and IGL6
genes. Overall, the 6 main scFvs in cluster A showed limited diversity and encompassed none of the three best
clones. In contrast, cluster B, composed of 8 scFvs (scFvs
1, 23, 4, 43, 35, 44, 38, 31), contained more variability.

Figure
ogenetic4 of the
Groupingtree 19 non redundant scFvs, in the form of phylGrouping of the 19 non redundant scFvs, in the form
of phylogenetic tree. The tree root (extreme left) indicates that the scFvs are grouped in two clusters, A (scFvs 48,
11, 34, 9, 47, 13, 30, 37, 7, 15) on the upper part, and B
(scFvs 8, 1, 23, 4, 43, 35, 44, 38, 31) on the lower part of the
figure.

Six different IGHV genes (1–69, 3–11, 3–23, 3–74, 4–28
and 4–34) were combined with 5 different IGHD genes
(3–10, 1–1, 2–8, 6–13, 5–12) and two different IGHJ
genes (4 and 5). Similarly, the 8 κ light chains of cluster B
were coded by a combination of 7 IGKV genes (1–9, 1–16,
1–17, 1–18, 1–39, 1-NL1, 3–15) and 4 IGKJ genes (1, 2,
3, 4). Thus, detailed analysis of the genes re-arranged to
code for the scFvs constituting clusters A and B showed
that B had a higher diversity than A. This higher diversity
of cluster B was also evidenced by the longer branches of
the B subtree as compared to A, and this diversity very possibly allowed cluster B to encompass all the best clones.
Such a difference of diversity between clusters is much
more easily observed from the tree and subtrees than analysed as detailed above. The presentation of the diversity
of antibody sequences in the form of trees could be of further interest when analyzing antibody fragments isolated
from a library, even though these trees were not initially
designed for this purpose.
The 43RCA scFv was the most efficient scFv for neutralization of ricin biological activity, and had very similar
human germline counterparts as identified by IMGT/VQUEST software. The overall identity between 43RCA
eight framework regions and their most similar peptidic
sequences, coded by human germinal genes, was 90%. In
the IMGT Collier de Perles representation of 43RCA (Figure 5), black squares indicated amino acids that differ
from the closest human germline genes IGHV3-11*01
and IGHJ4*02 for VH and IGKV1-17*01 and IGKJ4*01
for VL. By using IMGT amino acid classes [26], an analysis
of the physicochemical properties of these differing
43RCA framework residues was performed and its results
summarized in table 4. In particular, the proximity of
43RCA with sequences coded by human germline genes
was further appreciated by the fact that only four residues,
three located in VH (S40>D and Y55>R in FR2-IMGT,
T122>V in FR4-IMGT) (human>macaque) and one in VL
(T101 > V in FR3-IMGT) on a total of 180 framework residues, were rated as very dissimilar.

Discussion
By immunizing with the chain A of ricin (RCA-A), a toxin
subunit, we developed a non-human primate (NHP)
immune library screened with whole ricin, and we isolated an scFv with picomolar affinity for ricin.
When immunizing with RCA-A, a plant protein that is
presumably very different from the macaque self proteins,
we anticipated our antigen would be strongly recognised
as foreign and elicit a strong immune response. After three
injections however, assessment of anti-ricin antibody via
an ELISA with RCA-A as the antigen resulted in unexpectedly low titres (in the range of 1:20,000). After a 4th injection, serum was again tested using an ELISA with both
RCA-A and whole ricin as antigens. Although RCA-A was
the immunogen, titres against RCA-A were 7-fold lower
than those against ricin. The differences were probably
due to the conformational changes of the subunit when
coated onto the plate. The titre measured against whole
ricin was 1:250,000 after the fourth injection, indicating a
strong antibody response in this NHP. This hypothesis
was confirmed when amplification products were
obtained with our antibody-specific primers (macaque κ
and γ specific) 3 days after the last (fifth) injection, the
earliest products we had ever obtained. All pairs of primers allowed amplification 4 days later (7th day post-injection). When compared to our previous work with Bacillus
anthracis protective antigen (PA) in which the optimal
amplification was obtained 35 days after the last immunization, these high responses obtained as early as 3 days
after the last immunization were interesting and significant. We hypothesized that this early response, obtained
from immunogen-stimulated lymphocytes at the beginning of antigen circulation and thus present at low concentrations, corresponded to the existence of high-affinity
surface immunoglobulins that would later be secreted by
these lymphocytes. A high library diversity is however necessary to encompass scFvs with the desired specificity
(here, directed against neutralizing epitopes). We chose,
in order to build the library, the PCR products obtained
on the 7th day because, at this still early time after the
boost, all PCR primers permitted amplification. For the
first time in this study, we also utilized primers designed
to amplify VLλ-coding DNAs. The cDNA, that had been
previously extracted from bone marrow on the two best
days, had been stored (-20°C) and was re-utilized: 5 out
of the 11 human λ primers permitted amplification,
though more weakly than the macaque κ primers. As a
consequence, VLλ pre-cloning was rather inefficient and
the size of the VLλ sub-library was ten times smaller than
the VLκ library.
After the pre-cloning and cloning steps, the size of the
pooled (VLλ and VLκ) anti-ricin library was 2 × 108
clones; therefore, it was not significantly higher than our
former anti-Lethal Factor (LF) library (108 clones), and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/60

this size could not explain the high affinities encountered
in this study [21,22]. Because we wanted to search for scFv
that would interact with the whole toxin and not A chain
alone, and also because of the conformationnal change of
RCA-A when coated onto ELISA plates, the library was
panned against whole ricin. After panning, while 50
clones were isolated for sequencing, only 19 full-sized,
non-redundant sequences were obtained. Approximately
half of these sequences had VL of the λ isotype, despite the
small size of the VLλ library, probably indicating interest
of the λ primers, which were specially designed for the
present library construction. These 19 clones were
expressed and initially tested for neutralization as the neutralizing activity, not affinity, was a goal of the present
study. Since there was not a standardized test for ricin
neutralization, we chose to establish a cell-based ricin
neutralization assay as an adaption of the assay we previously utilized on numerous occasions to assess the neutralization of anthrax lethal toxin [21,22]. This cell-based
assay utilised the mouse macrophage J774A.1 cell line
(ATCC-LGC, Molsheim, France), which is also sensitive to
ricin [27]. We plated J774A.1 cells with ricin (15 ng/ml)
for 24 hours to induce approximately 100% cell death
This test is stringent because of its long duration that
necessitated scFvs of high affinities to form stable scFvricin complexes. We also showed that scFv stability was
indeed crucial in this test for effective neutralization of
ricin.
By using the cell-based neutralization assay, there was
only one clone (43RCA) that neutralized 50% of the ricin
toxicity with a scFv/toxin molar ratio equal to four. Neutralization by the second best clone (44RCA) was found to
be 4 times less efficient. Precise affinity measurements
thus focused on 43RCA. To the best of our knowledge, the
obtained value of 41 pM is amongst the best affinities
obtained directly from any library panning, without the
need for further affinity engineering. This value was not an
aberration, since the second best clone also had picomolar affinity. These final results were in accordance to our
initial hypothesis, supported by the early PCR product
amplification, that the immune response to ricin would
be strong. The value of 43RCA for therapeutics was further
assessed in a cell-free translation assay, where it was
favourably compared to IgG obtained from serum of mice
hyperimmunized with the dgRCA-A. This polyclonal has
a high neutralization capacity and, in particular, it was
more efficient than any monoclonal at our disposal. The
fact that 43RCA scFv fragment produced in vitro had an
efficiency three times higher that of hyperimmune polyclonal IgG suggests that this anti-ricin scFv (or the IgG
derived from it) could be a therapeutic of choice against
ricin intoxication.
The analysis of scFv sequences, by using the new online
tool http://www.phylogeny.fr/ to build a phylogenetic

tree, grouped the scFvs in two clusters (A and B) with A
showing less variability than B. The higher diversity of B
certainly explains why it encompassed all three outstanding best clones (scFvs 38RCA, 43 RCA, 44 RCA). The
diversity of cluster B was quickly appreciated from the
branch lengths of the corresponding phylogenetic subtree, as opposed to the sub-tree representing cluster A. In
the future, these phylogenetic trees could well be a useful
guide for the testing of clones eluted from immune libraries, all the more if more numerous sequences are to be
analyzed. Systematic analysis of all clones should probably be reserved to highly variable clusters, represented by
long-branched sub-trees, while sampling of only a limited
number of scFvs originating from the least variable
("short-branched") clusters might be sufficient.

Conclusion
NHP immune libraries have formerly allowed us to isolate
two neutralizing antibody fragments directed at each subunit (PA and LF) of the anthrax lethal toxin. In this current
study, we successfully developed an antibody fragment to
neutralize another bioweapon (BW), ricin, and this antibody fragment has now been expressed as a full-size IgG,
to be tested in vivo in the future and possibly utilised for
prophylactic or therapeutic purposes. This approach
might be re-utilized as antibodies can efficiently neutralize a vast majority of the numerous BW (in particular the
most dangerous ones, such as botulinum toxins, plague,
anthrax, smallpox, tularaemia and ricin). Our NHP antibody fragments can be "germline-humanized" ("superhumanized") [24] to ensure their excellent bioavailibility
and tolerance. Such predicable pharmacokinetics properties are in opposition to the situation of less predictable
synthetic molecules, which fail at an alarmingly high rate
(90%) during clinical trials. The end result is loss of significant expenditures and time. This failure rate has not,
however, prevented studies in search of synthetic molecules against ricin [14,15]. This is despite a situation
where the efficacy of antibodies to neutralize ricin
(including its aerosolised form) had been well documented [17-19], but only one chimeric anti-ricin antibody was available [20]. Thus, choosing and financing a
more risky path towards therapeutics than the isolation of
more effective anti-ricin antibodies, typically focused on
human antibodies, tends in particular to indicate that the
isolation of such human antibodies is somehow difficult.
A similar situation was encountered regarding antibodies
directed against the LF subunit of anthrax lethal toxins, in
that very few anti-LF antibodies were obtained despite
requirements by anthrax experts, while the isolation of
many anti-PA antibodies has been financed. The anthrax
situation might be particularly revealing, because anti-PA
antibodies were, in their large majority, obtained with
techniques that started with lymphocytes of anthrax-vaccinated donors. The anthrax vaccine (AVA) lacks LF, thus

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/60

explaining the rarity of human LF-primed lymphocytes
and finally of anti-LF antibodies. Similarly, the scarcity of
ricin-primed human lymphocytes certainly explains the
absence of human anti-ricin recombinant antibodies.
Humans are not naturally exposed to ricin, and there is
not a vaccine approved for human use, at present. Naïve
and synthetic libraries of human antibody fragments, and
mice engineered with human IgG-coding DNA, have been
developed to produce human antibodies without the
need for lymphocytes from immunized humans. However, it is interesting to note that these tools were not successful, or not utilized, in the two examples quoted above.
In summary of the present study, we have developed
improvements in several aspects of our cost-conscious
path towards obtaining neutralizing NHP recombinant
antibody fragments for clinical purposes. Due to their
proximity with their human counterparts, plus the possibility of "super-humanizing" these antibody fragments
[24], such reagents would provide well tolerated therapy
against ricin, anthrax, as well as other BW agents. In addition, our methodology developed in the current study
should be of interest to researchers beyond the field of
BW.

Methods
Animal immunization
A cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) (6 kg) was
subcutaneously injected with the non toxic A-chain of
ricin (RCA-A) purchased from Sigma, Saint Louis, Missouri. The first injection was RCA-A (100 μg per injection)
mixed with complete Freud's adjuvant (Sigma) and then
RCA-A mixed with incomplete Freud adjuvant for the
remaining injections.

Animal housing was performed in facilities accredited by
veterinary services. Animals were provided with NHP
feed, water ad libitum, and maintained on a 12-h light
cycle. The protocol was approved by the CRSSA ethical
committee for animal care and use.
Construction and screening of the anti-ricin antibody gene
library
Bone marrow (5 ml) was sampled several times after the
last boost in order to isolate RNA using Tri Reagent
(Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was retroamplified, then primers intended for the amplification of
DNA encoding macaque Fd and VLκ were utilised as formerly exposed [22]. Later, a set of human λ primers (table
1) was utilised under the same PCR conditions.

PCR products were first cloned in the pGemT vector
(Promega, Madison, Wiscontin), according to the manufacturer's instructions, yielding three antibody gene sublibraries encoding the heavy (Fd fragment) or light (κ or

λ) chains. The pGemT cloned PCR products were reamplified using two oligucleotide primer sets for introducing
restriction sites for library cloning. A set of macaque κ oligonucleotide primers [21] or of human λ oligonucleotide
primer (table 1) were used as forward (annealing to the 5'
end of VH or VL) oligonucleotide primers. Only macaquespecific oligonucleotide primers were used as reverse oligonucleotide primers ([21] and table 1). The secondary
PCRs were carried with separated forward oligonucleotide
primers in order to maintain diversity. Each PCR was performed in 100 μl using 100 ng purified PCR reaction of
the pGemT cloned cDNA, 4 U Red Taq (Sigma, Hamburg,
Germany), 200 μM dNTPs each and 200 nM of each oligonucleotide primer for 20 cycles (30 s 94°C, 30 s 57°C,
30 s 72°C), followed by 10 min 72°C. The PCR products
were separated by a 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel, then cut out
and purified using Nucleospin Extract II Kit (MachereyNagel, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer's
instructions.
Construction of the library was performed in two steps.
First, the VLκ or VLλ PCR products were cloned to
pHAL14 [21,28,29] and second, the VH PCR products
were cloned to pHAL14 containing the VLκ or VLλ repertoire. The pHAL14 (5 μg), as well 2 μg VL (VLκ or VLλ),
were digested using 50 U MluI and 50 U NotI (NEB,
Frankfurt, Germany) in a 100 μl reaction volume (2 h at
37°C). The digest was inactivated by heating at 65°C for
10 min. Afterwards, 0.5 U calf intestinal phosphatase
(MBI Fermentas) was added to the digested pHAL14 and
incubated for an additional 30 min. This step was
repeated once. The vector was purified using the Nucleospin Extract II Kit and 270 ng VL were cloned into 1 μg of
the dephosporylated pHAL14 by incubating overnight
(16°C) with 1 U ligase (Promega, Mannheim, Germany).
The ligation reactions were precipitated with ethanol plus
sodium acetate, and the pellet washed two times with
70% ethanol. These reactions were electroporated (1.7
kV) in 25 μl XL1-Blue MRF' (Stratagene, Amsterdam,
Netherlands). The transformed bacteria were plated onto
SOB agar plates (25 cm petri dishes) supplemented with
100 μg/mL ampicillin and 100 mM glucose. These colonies were harvested by suspending in 40 mL SOB media.
Plasmids from the VLκ or VLλ library were isolated using
the Nucleobond Plasmid Midi Kit (Macherey-Nagel)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five micrograms of each VL chain library, as well 1.5 μg of the VH
fragments, were digested using 50 U NcoI and 100 U HindIII (NEB) in a 100 μl reaction volume (overnight at
37°C). The following steps were performed as described
for VL with the following modification: 250 ng of the
digested and purified VH repertoire was used for ligation.
In total 2 transformations were performed. The harvested
bacteria, containing the final antibody gene libraries, were
aliquoted and stored at -80°C.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/60

For library packaging, 500 mL 2xTY medium [30] containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 100 mM glucose were inoculated with a 1 mL aliquot of the antibody gene library.
Bacteria were grown (37°C, 250 rpm rotary shaker incubator) to an O.D.600 of 0.4 – 0.5. Twenty-five millilitres of
bacteria (~1,25 × 1010) were infected with 2,5 × 1011
Hyperphage [31-33], incubated at 37°C for 30 min without shaking, followed by 30 min at 250 rpm. The infected
cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 3,220 × g).
The pellet was resuspended in 200 mL 2xTY containing
100 μg/mL ampicillin and 50 μg/mL kanamycin. The
phages were produced at 30°C and 250 rpm for 16 h.
Cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 10 min (10,000
× g). The supernatant containing the phages was precipitated with 1/5 volume of 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol
(PEG)/2.5 M NaCl solution (1 h on ice) with gentle shaking and then pelleted by centrifugation for 1 h at 10,000
× g (4°C). The precipitated phage were resuspended in 10
mL phage dilution buffer (10 mM TrisHCl pH7.5, 20 mM
NaCl, 2 mM EDTA) and filtered through a 0.45 μM filter.
Phage precipitation was repeated once more. The phage
pellet was diluted in 1 mL phage dilution buffer and cell
debris was pelleted by additional centrifugation (5 min. at
15,400 × g, 20°C). The supernatant containing the phage
were stored at 4°C. Each library packaging was controlled
by tittering, and subsequently tested by immunoblot
according to [28,34].
Screening of the library was performed as described elsewhere [35,36], except that 10, 15, and 30 washes were performed for each successive round of panning. Ricin was
utilized as the antigen and PBS-Tween 20 0.1% as the
washing buffer.
scFv production, ELISA testing
Phagemid DNA isolated after the panning process was
used to transform the non-suppressor E. coli strain
HB2151 such that it expressed the soluble scFv fragment.
Single colonies of randomly chosen transformants were
used to inoculate 5 ml of SB (Super Broth) medium supplemented with carbenicillin (50 μg.ml-1) and 1% glucose. In parallel (see below), the clones were sequenced so
that redundant clones were not re-analyzed. For expression, cultures were incubated overnight (30°C) with vigorous shaking (250 rpm). Five hundred milliliters of SB
medium supplemented with carbenicillin and 0.1% glucose were then inoculated with 500 μl of each culture. The
cultures were grown at 30°C until the 600 nm optical density (OD) reached a value of one. In order to induce gene
expression, IPTG (1 mM) was added and the cultures
incubated overnight (22°C). The cells were harvested by
centrifugation at 2500 × g for 15 min, 4°C. The scFvs were
extracted with polymyxin B sulphate [37] and purified
using a nickel column (Ni-NTA spin column, Qiagen,
Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

BMC Biotechnology 2009, 9:60

For ELISAs, RCA-A or ricin (Sigma, 10 μg/ml PBS) was
coated onto a 96 well microtitre plate (Maxisorp, Nunc,
Danemark). When sera were tested, the negative control
was pre-immune serum and secondary antibody reporter
utilized polyclonal anti-macaque IgG, Fc specific tagged
with HRP (Nordimmune, Tilburg, The Netherlands). The
antibody titre was measured as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of immune serum giving a signal three times
stronger than the negative control, at the same dilution.
When scFv were tested, they were detected by an anti-his
tag antibody (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France).
Ricin neutralization in cell-based assays
Soluble scFvs, eluted after the library panning and
expressed individually, were tested for their neutralization
capacity using a cell-based viability assay. In this assay,
cells are put in contact with ricin, in such conditions that
all cells die. The scFv to be tested is added, at different concentrations, to ricin and may inhibit its toxic activity. At
the end of the assay, cell viability is assessed and plotted
against scFv concentration. This assay replicates the two
main steps of ricin inhibition (internalization of the scFv
bound to ricin and inhibition of its toxic activity). More
precisely here, J774A.1 cells (ATCC-LGC, Molsheim,
France) were plated at a density of 14,000 cells/well (200
μl/well), cultured (37°C with 5% CO2) for 24 hours in
DMEM supplemented with 10% SVF. Ricin, at a concentration of 15 ng/ml (corresponding to 10 LD50, data not
shown), was pre-incubated with scFvs, or with control
serum for 1 h (37°C) and then added to the cells. After a
24 h incubation (37°C, 5% CO2), cell viability was determined by using the Cytotox 96 Non-radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega, Madison, Wi), as suggested by the
manufacturer. Each assay was corrected for 100% cell viability (control wells with no toxin and no scFv) and 0%
viability (control wells with ricin and no scFv). The scFv
concentration corresponding to 50% viability is defined
as the IC50 (inhibitory concentration 50%). These assays
were performed three times in triplicate. All experiments
were conducted on J774A.1 cells sub-cultured less than 15
times after receiving them from the vendor.
ScFv stability
The scFv stability was estimated by determining the percentage of scFv active after a 24 h incubation at 37°C in
DMEM medium. ScFvs (50 μg/ml in PBS) were incubated
in triplicate and then tested in an ELISA, utilizing a freshly
thawed aliquot for control.
Ricin neutralization in a cell-free translation assay
In this assay, a cell-free translation system is put in contact
with ricin, resulting in translation inhibition. The scFv is
added, at different concentrations, to ricin and may
inhibit its toxic activity. At the end of the assay, translation
activity is plotted against scFv concentration. This assay
replicates the intra-cellular step of ricin inhibition. More

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/9/60

precisely here, the neutralizing activity of the best scFv was
determined using a microtitre cell-free translation assay
that detects luciferase translation from luciferase m-RNA
[38]. By using phosphate buffered saline (PBS), antibodies were diluted in a 96 well microtitre plate and a constant amount of ricin (4 nM final concentration) was
added to the antibody dilutions. Dilutions of ricin alone
were included in each assay for generation of a standard.
In addition, anti-ricin IgGs, purified from serum of mice
that had been hyperimmunized with the dgRCA-A to
result in antibodies with a high neutralization activity of
ricin, were utilized as a benchmark of neutralization. The
plate was placed on a microplate shaker for 15 min
(25°C), and then 5 μl transferred to a v-shaped microtitre
plate. The rabbit reticulocyte lysate, RNasin, amino acids
complete, and luciferase m-RNA (Promega, Madison, WI)
were mixed together and 25 μl added to each well of the
v-shaped plate. Plates were incubated (37°C) for 90 min.
Five microliters of the translation lysate were transferred
to a black microtitre plate (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis,
MO). After the addition of 45 μl reaction buffer (Luciferase assay reagent, Promega, Inc.), luminescence was
measured as counts per second (CPS) on a Victor multiplate reader (PerkinElmer Wallac, Boston MA). Data was
expressed as the percent of control [% control = (CPS
treated/CPS control) × 100].
Affinity measurements
Affinities were measured by surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) with a BIAcore™ × (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden)
instrument. The scFv 43RCA was immobilized at a maximum of 100 RU on a CM5 chip (Biacore) via amine coupling, according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 30
μl/min flow rate was maintained during measurement.
For each measurement, eight ricin dilutions were prepared
in HBS-EP buffer (Biacore) (concentrations ranging from
1 to 250 nM) and were tested at various elution times
from 600 sec to 14,500 sec. For the precise measurement
of very high affinities, we were advised (C. Quetard,
Biacore, France) to use long elution times with the highest
tested ricin concentration. After each ricin dilution, the
chip was regenerated with 1.5 M glycine buffer (Biacore),
run 10 μl/min for 30 seconds. Constants were calculated
[39], and verified with internal consistency tests [40] as
formerly described.
Nucleic acid analysis of ricin-specific scFv clones
In parallel to expression, transformed HB2151 bacteria
were cultivated to isolate the phagemidic DNA (Nucleobond AX, Macherey-Nagel). Variable region sequences of
the light and heavy chains were determined by Genome
Express (Meylan, France) using the primers Mkmyc and
MkpelB, respectively [41]. The sequences were analyzed
on line, using the International ImMunoGeneTics information system ® (IMGT) [42]http://imgt.cines.fr and its
nomenclature. In particular, these sequences were comPage 11 of 13

pared with those of the human germline immunoglobulin genes by using the IMGT/V-QUEST [43] and IMGT/
JunctionAnalysis softwares [44]. Peptidic sequence comparisons utilized new IMGT tools [26], which classify and
compare three separate items; hydropathy, volume, and
chemical properties, for each amino acid. This three item
analysis was summarized as follows: when no significant
difference between two residues was recognised in the
three items, residues were regarded as highly similar.
When one difference was found, the residues were
regarded as similar but then regarded as dissimilar in the
case of two differences, and very dissimilar in the case of
three differences.

Acknowledgements
In addition, the similarities between all analysed scFv
sequences were analysed using a new on-line tool http://
www.phylogeny.fr/, which builds phylogenetic trees. Phylogenetics in the strict sense apply to immunoglobulins
because, due to somatic hypermutations that are the support for affinity maturation, unmutated rearranged germline sequences are ancestors of those coding for high
affinity antibodies. After library panning however, only
high affinity, mutated antibody fragments are retained.
Thus, in this study, we utilised this tool as a multiple
alignment software that displays results in the form of
phylogenetic trees or sub-trees, and applied it to the
sequences coding scFvs selected from the library. In such
trees, each node, where certain branches of a tree meet,
indicates the consensus shared by the different sequences
displayed at the extremity of corresponding branches. The
length of each branch, between each node and each
sequence, is in proportion with the differences between
the corresponding consensus and sequence.
