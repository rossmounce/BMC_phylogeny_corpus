Abstract
Background: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) causes acute or fulminant hepatitis in humans and is an important public
health concern in many developing countries. China has a high incidence of HEV epidemics, with at least three
genotypes (1, 3 and 4) and nine subtypes (1b, 1c, 3b, 4a, 4b, 4d, 4g, 4h and 4i) so far identified. Since genotype 3
and the newly identified subtype 4i have been exclusively limited geographically to Shanghai and its neighboring
provinces, the epidemiology of HEV infections within the municipality, a major industrial and commercial center,
deserves closer attention.
Findings: A total of 65 sequences, 60 located within the HEV SH-SW-zs1 genome [GenBank:EF570133], together
with five full-length swine and human HEV genomic sequences, all emanating from Shanghai, were retrieved from
GenBank. Consistent with the primary role of genotype 4 in China overall, analysis of the sequences revealed this
to have been the dominant genotype (58/65) in Shanghai. Six HEV subtypes (3b, 4a, 4b, 4d, 4h and 4i) were also
represented. However, although subtype 4a is the dominant subtype throughout China, subtype 4i (29/65) was the
most prevalent subtype among the Shanghai sequences, followed by subtypes 4d (10/65) and 4h (9/65). Subtypes
4h, 4i and 4d were found in both swine and humans, whereas 4b was found only in swine and subtype 4a only in
humans.
Conclusions: Six different swine and human HEV subtypes have so far been documented in Shanghai. More
molecular epidemiological investigations of HEV in swine, and particularly among the human population, should
be undertaken.

Findings
Hepatitis E virus (HEV), the causative agent of acute or
fulminant hepatitis in humans, is an important public
health concern in many developing countries. It is estimated that about two billion people, or one-third of the
world population, live in areas where HEV is endemic
and are therefore at risk of infection [1]. The disease is
thought to be transmitted by the fecal-oral route, usually
through contaminated drinking water.
HEV is a non-enveloped, single stranded, positivesense RNA virus belonging to the family Hepeviridae.
At least four mammalian HEV genotypes have been

recognized [2]. Genotypes 1 and 2 are primarily associated with fecal-oral transmission among humans and,
in developing countries, can lead to waterborne jaundice
epidemics. Genotypes 3 and 4 circulate in humans and
several animal species, and are associated with sporadic
infections among humans in industrialized countries [3].
In addition, two putative HEV genotypes, one from the
Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus) [4] and the other from
wild boar [5], were recently reported.
A recent study in China, where there is a high frequency of HEV epidemics, has shown that HEV seroprevalence among the general population was almost 40%
and increased with age at a rate of about 1% per year
[6]. Furthermore, the number of fecal samples taken
from young swine that tested positive for HEV RNA
ranged between 20-48% [7,8]. According to Zhu et al.

[9], at least three genotypes (1, 3 and 4) and nine subtypes (1b, 1c, 3b, 4a, 4b, 4d, 4g, 4h and 4i) of human
and swine HEV have so far been documented in China.
Since genotype 3 and the newly identified subtype 4i
have been limited geographically exclusively to Shanghai
and its neighboring provinces, the municipality, as a
major industrial and commercial center, is deserving of
close attention with respect to HEV infection
epidemiology.
A total of 60 sequences located within the HEV SHSW-zs1 genome (GenBank: EF570133] (44 between nt
6104 and nt 6256, and 16 between nt 6360 and nt 6509)
together with five full-length swine and human HEV
genomic sequences, all derived from Shanghai, were
retrieved from GenBank as of June, 2011. All the
sequences were aligned with Clustal W (version 1.8),
and the sequence percent identity was calculated using
Lasergene (version 7.10; DNAstar). Phylogenetic trees
were constructed by the neighbor-joining method [10],
based on the partial nucleotide sequences of the ORF2
region. Bootstrap values were determined on 3,000 resamplings of the data sets [11]. The criteria used to
define HEV genotypes or subtypes were adopted from
Lu et al. [12]. These authors demonstrated that an
assemblage of 300-450 nucleotides at the 5’ end of the
HEV ORF2 region was highly conserved and that phylogenetic analysis based on this region provided accurate
information about the genetic relationships between the
HEV isolates and their evolutionary state. The accession
numbers of HEV reference sequences are shown in Figure 1
Phylogenetic analysis indicated that six different HEV
subtypes, i.e. 3b, 4a, 4b, 4d, 4h and 4i (Figure 1) have so
far been prevalent in Shanghai. Genotype 4 was the most
highly represented genotype among the 65 Shanghai
sequences, and subtype 4i (29/65), followed by 4d (10/65)
and 4h (9/65), the most prevalent subtypes. Of the 29
sequences classified as subtype 4i, four were of human
origin and 25 were from swine. HEV strain SH-SW-zs1
[GenBank: EF570133], originating from swine and
regarded as the Shanghai prototype HEV strain, belonged
to subtype 4i. Furthermore, all the subtype 4i HEV
strains so far reported in China were isolated in the eastern part of the country, with 70% emanating from Shanghai, suggesting that subtype 4i strains are perhaps
indigenous to the municipality. Also included among this
subtype was the HEV strain, E067-SIJ05C [GenBank:
AB369690], collected from a patient suffering from acute
hepatitis E in Japan who had traveled to Shanghai before
the onset of the disease. Furthermore, the partial
sequence [GenBank: EU034710] of another subtype 4i
strain isolated from a human source in Shanghai was
found to be virtually identical to a partial HEV sequence
[GenBank: EU034714] obtained from a sample of swine

serum in eastern China during the same period, suggesting that the isolates had a common origin [13]. To date, a
total of nine subtype 4i HEV strains identified from full
genomic sequences deposited in GenBank have emanated
either from Japan or from Shanghai and neighboring
Jiangsu Province. HEV strains of human origin emanating from Japan (JYN-Shiz08L and JKS-Shiz07L) and from
Shanghai (E067-SIJ05C) were closely related to HEV
strains isolated from wild boar (wbJGF08-1) [14,15] and
from swine (SAAS-FX17) [16], respectively. In addition,
when phylogenetic clustering of subtype 4i HEV strains
was examined (data not shown), sequences from Japan
and Shanghai were positioned on different subtype 4i
branches, suggesting that each of these two groups of
strains derived from different origins. When compared
with other HEV subtype 4 strains across the whole genome, only two specific amino acid substitutions were
identified within the ORF1 of subtype 4i. One substitution was located in the methyltransferase motif and the
other in the macro domain and might therefore influence
HEV replication [17].
In this study, only subtypes 4h, 4i and 4d were found
in both swine and humans, whereas subtypes 4a and 4b
were confined to either human or swine populations,
respectively. According to Zhu et al. [16], subtypes 4a
and 4b HEV were capable of infecting both humans and
swine. Subtype 4a HEV is widely distributed among
both the swine and human populations in China as a
whole but swine subtype 4a HEV has not been identified
in Shanghai. A human subtype 4a strain isolated in
Shanghai, JYI-ChiSai01C [GenBank: AB197674], showed
the highest nucleotide similarity (94.0%) with a swine
HEV strain Ch-S-1, from Jilin Province [GenBank:
EF077630], suggesting that 4a subtypes in Shanghai
were also zoonotic. Human subtype 4b HEV has a more
limited distribution in China than the swine counterpart
[16] and, so far, no human subtype 4b strain has been
reported in Shanghai. However, not every sample from
hepatitis E cases in Shanghai has been analyzed sufficiently and the possibility that human subtype 4b exists
among the population of the municipality cannot be
excluded.
Genotype 3 HEV strains were geographically limited
to Shanghai and neighboring provinces, and seven
sequences were classified into subtype 3b. No human
genotype 3 HEV sequences were among those from
Shanghai although one strain, EChN22 [GenBank:
HM439285], was reported recently in neighboring
Jiangsu Province [18]. The EChN22 isolate clustered closely with Shanghai swine isolate FJ527832 and shared
97.2% nucleotide and 99.6% amino acid homologies,
which suggested that genotype 3 strains prevalent in
Shanghai possibly participated in human-swine
transmission.

No genotype 1 HEV representatives were found in this
study, possibly due to the limited number (10/65) of
human HEV sequences available.
In summary, six different HEV subtypes, i.e. 3b, 4a,
4b, 4d, 4h and 4i, have so far been shown to be prevalent in Shanghai, with genotype 4 and subtype 4i the
dominant forms. Only subtypes 4h, 4i and 4d were
found in both swine and human hosts, whereas subtypes
4a and 4b were confined to either human or swine
populations, respectively. A recent epidemiological
investigation has shown that the average incidence of
HEV RNA positives among the swine population of
Shanghai was approximately 20.0%, and that serum IgG
positives reached 72.18% [19]. Hepatitis infection rates
(all types) ranged between 15.0-35.0% among the
younger population and reached 47.0% in older people.
Furthermore, 39.4-69.7% cases of sporadic hepatitis E
involved co-infection with other hepatitis viruses [20].
Human hepatitis E infections have increased significantly in recent years and, in Shanghai, have now
become the third most likely cause of hepatitis disease
after hepatitis A and B [21]. Consequently, more molecular epidemiology investigations of HEV among swine,
and particularly human, populations should be undertaken to assist in HEV control and prevention.
