Abstract
Background: Global climatic oscillations, glaciation cycles and the unique geographic topology of China have
profoundly influenced species population distributions. In most species, contemporary distributions of populations
cannot be fully understood, except in a historical context. Complex patterns of Pleistocene glaciations, as well as other
physiographic changes have influenced the distribution of bat species in China. Until this study, there had been no
phylogeographical research on Myotis davidii, an endemic Chinese bat. We used a combination of nuclear and
mitochondrial DNA markers to investigate genetic diversity, population structure, and the demographic history of M.
davidii. In particular, we compared patterns of genetic variation to glacial oscillations, topography, and environmental
variation during the Pleistocene in an effort to explain current distributions in light of these historical processes.
Results: M. davidii comprises three lineages (MEP, SWP and SH) based on the results of molecular variance analysis
(AMOVA) and phylogenetic analyses. The results of a STRUCTURE analysis reveal multi-hierarchical population structure
in M. davidii. Nuclear and mitochondrial genetic markers reveal different levels of gene flow among populations. In the
case of mtDNA, populations adhere to an isolation-by-distance model, whereas the individual assignment test reveals
considerable gene flow between populations. MDIV analysis indicate that the split of the MEP and SWP/SH lineages,
and from the SWP and SH lineages were at 201 ka BP and 158 ka BP, respectively. The results of a mismatch distribution
analysis and neutrality tests indicate a population expansion event at 79.17 ka BP and 69.12 ka BP in MEP and SWP,
respectively.
Conclusions: The complex demographic history, discontinuous extant distribution of haplotypes, and multiplehierarchy population structure of M. davidii appear associated with climatic oscillations, topography and ecoenvironmental variation of China. Additionally, the three regions are genetically differentiated from one another in the
entire sample set. The degree of genetic differentiation, based on the analysis of mtDNA and nDNA, suggests a malemediated gene flow among populations. Refuges were in the MEP, SH and the lower elevations of SWP regions. This
study also provides insights for conservation management units (MEP, SWP and SH).
Background
Global climatic oscillations and associated glaciation
cycles have profoundly influenced species population distributions [1]. Pleistocene climate oscillations have contributed to the genetic structure of current species [2]
and have played an important role in initiating intra-specific divergences of North American animal taxa [3].

However, climate condition in China during glacial periods appears to have been different from those of the rest
of the world and bring about a series of eco-environmental effects, primarily due to the continuing uplift of the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau [4]. The uplift has heavily influenced the climatic and environment changes, and formed
a complicated topography (a set of three ladders with the
highest point to the west and the lowest to the east). The
uplift has also had a decisive effect on the formation of
the East-Asia monsoon, which increased the climatic dif-

ferences between the glacial and interglacial period and
influenced the extent of the glacial advance in China [4].
Additionally, climatic change induces changes in vegetation distribution, which also influences the distribution of
animal populations through food chain and habitat modifications [5]. Thus, the distribution and change of forest
vegetation may have influenced the migration, expansion
and even extinction of animal populations which differed
considerably from other regions of the world at the same
latitude [4].
David's myotis (Myotis davidii) is endemic to China,
occurring in a small province of middle and northern
China [6]. This species is considered of least concern by
IUCN [6]. The measurements of the bat specimen have
on average 31.7 mm forearm length [7], 237.21 mm wingspan and weight 4.31 g (unpublished data). The wing
morphology of this bat species is characterized by low
wing loading and low aspect ratio, indicating that M.
davidii has typically good manoeuvrability [8]. They prey
on flying insects and inhabit rock or karst cavities [9].
Generally, cavities inhabited by this species are located in
forests with high levels of insect diversity (unpublished
results). However, there are no reports about migration,
hibernation or ecological preferences. Previous research
[10] on animal fossils of China has shown that the survival of bats depended mainly on forest cover. Furthermore, bat numbers or activity changes can be related to
climate change [11]. Thus, bats are a good model for
examining historical processes and distributional patterns following climatic oscillations.
In China, studies on the geographic distribution pattern of vertebrates, such as bats [12], birds [13] and
amphibians [14], have described evolutionary histories
following the global Pleistocene climatic oscillations and
reflected differences with Europe in terms of evolution
history in the context of complex regional scenarios [15].
Colonization events, dispersal patterns and migratory
behaviours play a key role in determining a species' geographical distribution range and demographic history
[15,16]. In addition, both historical events and ecological
factors shape extant genetic diversity and population
structure of animals [17]. Usually, analysis of genetic
markers can be useful to successfully differentiate finescale structures in natural populations [16,18].
Different markers have their own unique genealogy,
which may indicate concordance or divergence from the
species' history. Mitochondrial DNA only reveals a species' maternal demographic history. However, microsatellite-derived data is influenced by sex-biased dispersal
because of the character of biparental inheritance. Thus,
the combination of different markers may actually provide complementary information to test the population
demographic history [15] and extant population structure [18]. We therefore chose to include both nuclear

DNA (nDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) analyses in our study of the phylogeography of M. davidii, for
which genetic diversity, demographic history, and population structure remain unknown. Our main aims were to
identify genetic diversity, describe macrogeographical
population genetic patterns, and investigate the population demographic history within a context of climate
oscillations, complex topology and eco-environmental
variation since the mid-late Pleistocene. We inferred the
historical causation of the extant population structure to
better understand its distribution and population status.
Additionally, we wanted to identify possible conservation
management units and ultimately use information from
the study to provide some advice on the further protection for M. davidii.

Results
Based on our research from 2001 to 2009, M. davidii was
found to be scarce, but the distribution range was more
extensive than previous records. Based on topography
and physiography, populations of M. davidii can be
divided into three regions: Middle East Plain (MEP),
Southwest Plateau (SWP), and South Hills (SH) (Fig. 1
and Table 1).
mtDNA and nDNA genetic diversity

Examination of mitochondrial HVI sequences showed
length variation (579-909 bp). The R1 repeat (consisting
of three to seven 81 bp repeats) within mtDNA HVI
region which responsible for the length variation of HVI
region, were excluded from the analysis. After exclusion
of the tandem repeats, the 340 bp sequence of the HVI
region revealed 53 different haplotypes, defined by variation at 159 polymorphic sites. Thirty-eight of these polymorphisms were the result of indels, and 72 polymorphic
sites were parsimony-informative. Haplotype diversity (h)
averaged over all populations 0.975 ± 0.002. Haplotype
diversity (h) was uniformly high and was the highest in
the MEP region (Table 1). Most haplotypes were unique
(36 haplotypes, 28.57% of the individuals). Other haplotypes were shared within populations (17 haplotypes,
69.84% of the individuals), among populations (5 haplotypes, 38.89% of the individuals) or among regions (2
haplotypes, 21.43% of the individuals; AH1 shared with
YN1/YN2/YN3 and JS shared with YN1/YN4) (Additional file 1). Nucleotide diversity (π) averaged over all
populations 0.062 ± 0.007. Patterns of variation in nucleotide diversity across regions were consistent with that of
haplotype diversity in that the greatest diversity was
found in the MEP and the lowest in the SWP and the SH
lineages (Table 1).
Analysis of nDNA genetic diversity indicated that
observed heterozygosity ranged from 0.43 to 0.70, and
allelic richness ranged from 1.43 to 1.75 among popula-

tions (Table 1). We did not detect any statistically significant deviations from HW equilibrium among the eight
loci (Table 2). No genotypic linkage disequilibrium was
found between or within population samples. None of the
inbreeding coefficients (Fis) were significant at the population level (Table 1), suggesting random mating within
populations and the absence of null alleles.
Phylogenetic and demographic analysis

Maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML)
and Bayesian inference (BI) yielded highly concordant
results (Fig. 2). Each tree revealed that M. davidii formed
a monophyletic lineage with respect to congeneric species (M. daubentoni, M. lucifugus, M. adversus, M. altarium, M. bombinus, M. chinensis, M. pequinius). In three
trees, haplotypes grouped into two clades, representing
the SWP/SH and MEP lineages (Fig. 2). Divergence time
was estimated to be 201 ka (95% credibility interval 280113 ka BP) based on the results of MDIV analysis. The
former lineage was further subdivided into two subclades, SWP and SH (Fig. 2), for which the divergence
time was estimated to be 158 ka BP (95% credibility interval 230-77 ka BP).
In regard to the neutrality tests, negative values of
Tajima's D and Fu's Fs in MEP (PD = 0.005, PFs = 0.026)
and SWP (PD = 0.048, PFs = 0.049) were all significantly
deviated from "0" (Table 3), which can be interpreted as a
signal of demographic expansion in both regions. However, SH and the populations in the whole distribution
range did not indicate demographic expansion based on
the non-significant P values of Tajima's D and Fu's Fs
(Table 3). A mismatch distribution analysis also indicated
population expansion events in MEP and SWP based on a
small and nonsignificant SSD and r values (Table 3). The
population expansion time was 79.17 ka BP and 69.12 ka
BP in MEP and SWP, respectively (Table 3).

An AMOVA revealed significant genetic variance for all
three hierarchical levels examined (among regions,
among populations within regions, and within populations) (Additional file 2). The grouping pattern was MEP
(composed of AH1, AH2, JS, ZJ, JX, CQ2), SWP (composed of CQ1, GZ1, GZ2, HN, YN1, YN2, YN3, YN4),
and SH (composed of GD1, GD2, GX) gave the highest
ΦCT value (0.771, P < 0.01). Most of the genetic variance
(64.82%) was explained by differences among the three
regions (Additional file 2). The subdivisions depicted by
the AMOVA are consistent with the macrogeographical
structure of China (Fig. 1). In addition, the analysis of
AMOVA highlighted a low but significant microsatellite
genetic variation (14.45%) among the three regions and a
high proportion of genetic of variation (68.98%) within
populations (Additional file 2). In mtDNA, the pairwise
genetic differences among populations varied from 0.007
to 0.988 (P < 0.01) (Additional file 3), and only 3.13% of
pairwise genetic differences were not significant in the
whole population. In nDNA, the pairwise genetic difference among populations varied from 0.004 to 0.276 (P <
0.01) (Additional file 3), and 82.14% pairwise genetic differences in the SWP lineage were not significant. Thus
the pairwise genetic differences among populations
within regions were smaller than among regions in both
markers (Additional file 3). These results suggest that the
genetic differentiation maximizes among the three
regions.
A Mantel test indicated that genetic subdivision within
M. davidii fits an isolation-by-distance model (R2 = 0.296,
P = 0.031) with respect to mtDNA. However, nuclear
markers failed to support isolation-by-distance model (R2
= 0.030, P = 0.895).
Due to its small sample size, the CQ2 population (n = 2)
was excluded from the STRUCTURE analysis. Clustering
of individuals based on their multi-locus genotypes
revealed substantial hierarchical structure among populations across the species range (Fig. 3). When we
assigned individuals to clusters at K = 2 clustering recovered two groups, which is in agreement with the ML tree
lineages (MEP vs. SWP/SH) (Fig. 2 and Fig. 3). At K = 3,
the SWP and SH groups formed a distinct cluster which
is in agreement with the sub-lineages of ML tree (SWP vs.
SH). Individuals from SH region showed the least similarity with the MEP region. SWP region was observed to be
separated into two clusters at K = 4, represented by a relatively low-elevation plateau (YN1-YN2) and a relatively
high-elevation plateau, with evidence of a cline in membership between these clusters. An additional division
was detected between CQ1 and other populations in the
SWP region at K = 6. The separation at K = 4 and K = 6
was not the same as the ML tree lineages. The division
was detected between AH2-ZJ and other populations in

the MEP group at K = 2, however, a marked separation
was found between AH2 and ZJ in the ML tree. Within
the MEP region, individuals were assigned to two or more
populations at K = 5-6, whereas they can trace ancestry to
more than one population. The results of individual
assignment test indicated a frequency gene flow within
the MEP region. No marked variation in the population
structure was detected at K ≥ 7.
Individual assignment test indicated that a greater proportion of individuals of M. davidii (63.49%) were
assigned to the populations from which they were sampled. Within the MEP, SWP and SH regions, 44.44%,
23.53% and 19.05% of the individuals, respectively, were
assigned to other populations. Thus, results of the individual assignment test also pointed toward higher gene
flow among populations within regions, especially within
the MEP region. When using individual assignment tests
according to the three mtDNA clades, one individual
(0.79%) in the SWP (HN) group were assigned to the SH
(GD2) group. Two individuals (1.58%) in the MEP (ZJ)
group were assigned to the SWP (YN3/YN4) group.
Three individuals (2.38%) in the SWP group were
assigned to the MEP group, where YN3 and GZ2 originated from ZJ/JS and JX, respectively. Thus, 4.75% of
individuals were assigned to other lineages, which indicated a weak gene flow among the three regions.

Discussion
Genetic structure of populations

Compared with similar study on bat mtDNA [19], M.
davidii showed higher mean nucleotide diversity (mean π

= 0.062 ± 0.007). The presence of high h and high π indicated that a sub-lineage formed over long periods of evolutionary time [20]. In addition, a high h and high π
indicated high levels of divergence within three regions,
which was attributed to secondary contact between previously differentiated allopatric lineages. Like other bat
species [18,19], M. davidii was not detected the continuity gene flow among populations based on mtDNA. In
addition, isolation by distance was an important factor
for the formation of genetic structure within maternal
populations. The pattern of subdivision into subpopulations can be explained by the influence of environmental
characteristics. In China, the west-east axis was a direction of the prominent changes in many environmental
variables, such as vegetation types, temperature, precipitation, and topography, all of which were due to the continuing uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The
dependence of genetic differentiation on a gradient of
environmental variables is in agreement with the theoretical model of Doebeli & Dieckmann [21], showing that
processes of evolutionary diversification may lead to
sharp geographical differentiation along environmental
gradients. The environmental gradients existed for an
extended period of time which reflected in mtDNA.
However, the population genetic structure in microsatellite loci was less pronounced than in the case of mtDNA
analysis. Bayesian clustering analysis (Fig. 3) and individual assignment test showed frequent migration within
regions. And the patterns of migration followed a stepping-stone colonization model. Large and non-significant
Fis values also showed frequent transfer in males among

You et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2010, 10:208

populations and led to an unobvious population structure. Patterns of genetic differentiation in two molecular
markers were attributed to male dispersal and female
philopatry [22,23]. Male-biased gene flow implied low
introgression of mtDNA haplotypes from neighboring
populations, and therefore greater structuring in mtDNA
as compared with nuclear markers.
Our comparisons showed that the deepest phylogenetic
split (SWP/SH vs. MEP, Fig. 2) among the haplotypes corresponded exactly to nDNA-based structure when genotypes were in two groups (K = 2, Fig. 3). The deepest
phylogenetic split was similar to the pattern obtained
from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum in China [15]. SWP
and SH lineages split during stage III of the glacial epoch
in the Yun-Gui plateau (154-136 ka BP) [24], and separated into two geographically defined lineages (Fig. 2),
which was in agreement with the results of the nDNA
analysis (K = 3, Fig. 3). The population genetic structure
was consistent with topographic and geographic characteristics of China. Thus, ecological environmental
changes, landscape structure differentiation, and the climate discrepancy are primary determinants of population boundaries and rate of movement among regions
[25,26].
When these regions were considered separately we
found clear differences in the phylogeographical signal
obtained from the two sets of markers. Multi-locus genotyping data suggest that M. davidii has multiple levels of
population structure (Fig. 3), which were not shown by
mtDNA. Compared with mtDNA, the concordance
between the two markers seemed to break down within
the SWP clade. These similarities and discrepancies
between the data sets together clarify the history of this
species within the SWP region. In the SWP, four sampling locations in Yunnan, formed an independent lineage (Fig. 2), which coincided with the elevation
difference of other populations (GZ, CQ and HN; Fig. 1).
This result is in agreement with previous studies on birds
[13] and amphibians [14]. However, nDNA analysis indicated that the separation of the YN1-YN2 vs. other populations in the SWP group was maintained following the
introduction of a fourth and fifth microsatellite-based
cluster, which indicated much more frequent contact
between YN1 and YN2 populations than between these
two and any other population. Additional discordance at
K = 4 indicated postglacial colonization across the whole
range of SWP region with evidence of a cline in membership between these clusters. Discordance at K = 6 indicated that CQ1 population might be isolated by
geographical barrier, although CQ1 and other locations
(HN, GZ1 and GZ2) were all in the same lineage of the
phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3). These clusters in YN1-YN2 and
CQ1 may represent a discrete, discontinuous jump across
a relatively small geographical distance. The gene

exchange among M. davidii populations in SWP also may
be impeded by the limit of landscape.
In the MEP region, no obvious population structure
was found at the higher level of K = 5-7, which indicated a
continual population contact with one another. Extensive
and overlapping ranges within the MEP region of the
Bayesian clustering analysis (Fig. 3) indicated the absence
of geographical features in the landscape that would not
constitute efficient barriers for bat dispersal. SH also
showed no clear population division and indicated a
much more stable population structure than that of MEP.
Population demographic reconstructions

Since the Middle and Late Pleistocene, violent glacialinterglacial cycles (at least 24 Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles
and several Heinrich events between 115 ka BP and 14 ka
BP; on average, each fluctuating glacial cycles persisted
for about 1500 years [27]), complicated topology and ecoenvironmental changes due to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
uplift [4] had important influences on the demographic
history of many species [12-15]. With the complexity climatic conditions due to glacial oscillation and QinghaiTibet Plateau uplift, Chinese species have experienced a
unique evolutionary history [4].
Based on the divergence time estimated among
mtDNA lineages, the demographic history of M. davidii
could be traced back to before the Riss glaciation (210135 ka BP) during the Pleistocene [28], which was similar
to the glacial epoch in middle, southern and southwestern China (223-189 ka BP) [29]. Both markers thus support the scenario that the SWP and SH groups have a
similar history and a common origin, while a parallel
evolving history is observed for the SWP/SH and MEP
lineages.
In the MEP lineage, a population expansion event of M.
davidii was occured around 79.17 ka BP (Table 3). This
expansion thus took place during the end of the last interglacial period (130-75 ka BP), one of the warmer periods
[29]. The expansion time was younger than of the greater
horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) for Japan
(127-191 ka BP) [15] and was nearly the same as amphibians of the same region (80 ka BP) [14]. The different
expansion time with the greater horseshoe bat may be
due to the influence of glacial oscillations at different latitudes at the same time [30]. Bats are sensitive to environmental changes [11], such as the large-scale marine
transgressions in the MEP region [31], which may influence bats' migratory behaviour and geographic distribution [32]. Thus, a stepwise population expansion, inferred
by individual assignment test of nDNA, has taken place in
association with eco-environmental changes.
In the SWP region, a population expansion event of M.
davidii occurred around 69.12 ka BP (Table 3), and originated from relatively high elevation areas in SWP to the

MEP during 72-60 ka BP (early stage of the last glacial)
[33]. The expansion time was a little earlier than that of
the greater horseshoe bat (R. ferrumequinum) for Europe
(40-60 ka BP) and during the same period for Russia (1481 ka BP) [15]. Two haplotypes (21.43% individuals) were
shared between YN populations in the SWP and AH1-JS
populations in the MEP region. This conclusion is in
agreement with previous studies on bats [12], birds [13]
and amphibians [14]. The result of nDNA analysis (Fig. 3)
and an individual assignment test also indicated that
some individuals of M. davidii shared the same nDNA
alleles in the SWP and MEP regions, and no cline across
these populations. The high elevation areas of the SWP
region were the first to be affected by the sudden cold
weather caused by the lowering of the snow line during
the last glacial period (74-11.5 ka BP) [34]. Therefore,
some species or individuals in high altitudes may have
immigrated to refuges, such as Yunnan, or to other
regions in order to avoid such cold climatic conditions.
Based on the analysis of microsatellite data, a possible
regional population contact was interpreted, which
showed a similar allele site among populations in the SH
group (Fig. 3). Although the phylogenetic tree was interrupted between SH and SWP, the relationship between
SWP and SH groups was much closer than MEP based on
the mtDNA results (Fig. 2), which may be an indication of
SWP and SH origin from a common ancestor.
Refuges for Myotis davidii

At least two refuges have been reported in east China and
in the lower elevations of the southwestern plateau
[14,35]. In our study, the existence of three mitochondrial
lineages, with high nucleotide and allelic diversity
directed towards three relict refuges for M. davidii in
China, where an initial population expansion took place.
There is no clear indication of where the refuge of M.
davidii populations were located, but the possible areas
are the low-elevation plateau, such as Yunnan area and
Sichuan Basin (CQ2 is at its margin), where there were
large-scale relict refuges for many species [36]. In our
study, the results of nDNA analysis imply a relatively simpler genetic structure for M. davidii in YN1-YN2 and
CQ1, which is attributed to relict refuge during the last
glaciations. The eastern coast and south hills all were glacial refuges which were indicated by the high nucleotide
and allelic diversity of both markers. This trend also has
been demonstrated for other species [11].
Figure 2 Maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of Myotis davidii. Maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian
inference (BI) of our dataset resulted in concordant topologies (bootstrap values are above the line and divergence times (ka BP), estimated
from MDIV, are below the line). Only Bootstrap values above 50% are
shown.

Protection considerations

Genetically divergent populations are increasingly being
recognized as appropriate units for conservation. The
results presented here potentially indicate three conservation management units (MEP, SWP and SH). For the
different management units, we suggest that protection

require several different measures. As for the MEP
region, in considering frequent contact among populations, there may be no barrier in population migration
due to the lack of mountains. Therefore, it is important to
strengthen the protection of these habitats. In the SWP
and SH regions, the gene exchange among M. davidii
populations may be impeded by the limit of landscape.
Therefore, it is important to protect migration corridors.
In addition, CQ2 is located in the Three Gorges Area at
the entrance of the Sichuan basin. Small mammal fossils
in the Three Gorges Area indicate that it provids a corridor for the exchange of fauna occurring in temperate and

more tropical areas to the south [10]. The position of
CQ2 in the phylogenetic tree also points to a corridor of
genetic exchange between the MEP and SWP/SH
regions. In addition, the finding that Fst and Φst values
between CQ2 and other populations within the MEP
region exceed values among all the other populations
suggests that populations of M. davidii are especially vulnerable to small population effects and fragmentation. A
corridor of genetic exchange, such as CQ2, and prey or
colony habitats should be protected to maintain population contact and its population persistence.

Conclusions
M. davidii is considered to be of least concern by IUCN
[6]. Also, before 2009 there were no systematic studies
made of the distribution limit, status, and phylogeography of Chinese endemic bat species. Our research has
shown that the distribution range of this species is more
extensive than indicated by previous records. M. davidii
also were found to be scarce and were not found in most
recorded locations during the last nine years. Therefore,
the public, environmental protection agencies, and various stakeholders should spark efforts for its future protection.
High haplotype and nucleotide diversity indicate that
M. davidii has had a long evolutionary history. Based on
the analysis of MDIV, the differentiation times among the
three regions were during the Riss glaciation (210-135 ka
BP), and the population differentiations correspond to a
series of geological events and glacial cycles. The populations in the MEP and SWP experienced expansion events
at about 79.17 ka BP and 69.12 ka BP, respectively. The
phylogeographic study showed deep genetic differentiations among populations of M. davidii. Glacial cycles,
ecological barriers and topological differences are associated with the extant distribution patterns and phylogenetic clades of M. davidii. The populations of M. davidii
formed multihierarchical population structures and also
conserved high genetic diversity in each region. The

degree of genetic differentiation, based on the analysis of
mtDNA and nDNA of M. davidii, suggests a male-mediated gene flow among populations or regions.

performed on an ABI 3730 automated DNA sequencer
(Applied Biosystems, Inc.).

Methods

Estimates of mitochondrial haplotype variability within
different regions and populations included the number of
haplotypes (A), haplotype diversity (h) and nucleotide
diversity (π). All estimates were made using ARLEQUIN
3.1 [44]. Values for polymorphic sites and parsimony
informative sites were estimated in DnaSP, version 4.0
[45].
Microsatellite genotype data were scored using the
Genemarker software 1.75 (SoftGenetics Inc.). Genetic
diversity was assessed for each population by calculating
expected heterozygosity (HE), observed heterozygosity
(HO) and average allelic richness (RS) determined with
FSTAT 2.9.3 [46]. Multi-locus Fis was calculated for each
population and adjusted for multiple tests using a Bonferroni's correction [47]. Deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was tested by permutation using
FSTAT 2.9.3 [46]. Tests for linkage disequilibrium
between loci for each population were performed with
GENEPOP 3.4 [47].

Sampling and Mitochondrial DNA amplification

We initiated our investigation of M. davidii in 2001. For 9
years, 126 individuals of M. davidii were collected from
17 localities (Fig. 1). All tissues were collected with a nonlethal method: this involved taking a wing punch biopsy
for DNA analysis [37]. Protocols for capturing and handling live bats followed the Regulations of Wildlife Conservation of the People's Republic of China (No. 24) [38],
which were approved by the Wildlife Conservation Association of China.
Total genomic DNA was isolated from tissue using the
Qiagen DNAeasy Tissue Kit. Hypervariable region I
(HVI) of mitochondrial control region was amplified by
polymerase chain reaction using primer pair P-F [39]. In
order to guarantee accurate sequencing, all amplification
and sequencing was repeated at least once. All PCR reactions were performed in 25.0 μL volumes, containing
approximately 10-30 ng of genomic DNA, 2.5 mM MgCl2,
75 mM Tris-HCl (pH9.0), 20 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.01% (v/v)
Tween-20, 0.2 mM dNTP mix, 10 μM of each primer and
1U of Bioline Taq polymerase. The following reaction
conditions were used: 3 min at 94°C; 40 cycles of 94°C for
1 min, 55°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min; and 72°C for 10
min. DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI 3730
automated DNA sequencers (Applied Biosystems). DNA
sequences were edited and aligned using BioEdit 7.0.5.3
[40]. All haplotypes were submitted to GenBank [GenBank: GU013475-GU013527].
Microsatellite genotyping

Subsequent to screening 16 microsatellite loci originally
isolated from either Myotis myotis [41] or M. daubentonii
[42], 8 polymorphic loci were selected for examining
genetic variation in M. davidii (Table 2). All forward
primers were labelled with 5'-Fluorescent bases (Table 2),
and PCR reactions were conducted in 10 μL volumes
containing 10 ng of template DNA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 75
mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), 20 mM (NH4)2SO4, 0.01% (v/v)
Tween-20, 0.2 mM dNTP mix, 1 μM of each primer and
0.5 U of Bioline Taq polymerase. Touchdown PCR was
used with all primers, with an initial denaturing step of 3
min at 94°C. The annealing temperature of the reaction is
decreased 0.5°C each cycle from 60°C to a touchdown at
50°C, at which temperature 20 cycles are carried out. An
additional 25 cycles were then performed with 30 s denaturing at 91°C and 30 s annealing at 50°C. No extension
steps were included [43], apart from a 5 min period at
72°C following the final annealing step. Genotyping was

Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic analyses of unique haplotypes included both
maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood
(ML) algorithms performed in PAUP 4.0b10 [48]. A GTR
+ G + I model was used, as determined by Modeltest 3.7
[49] (base frequencies: A, 0.3870; C, 0.2174; G, 0.1122;
and T, 0.2834; transition/transversion ratio = 4.9960; proportion of invariable sites Pinvar = 0.0892; gamma distribution shape parameter = 2.4244). MP analyses were
conducted using a heuristic search option with 100 random sequence additions and tree-bisection-reconnection
(TBR) branch swapping. Robustness of the MP trees was
assessed by 1000 bootstrap replicates. ML analyses used
parameters estimated from trees obtained from MP analyses. ML analyses used heuristic searches with starting
trees obtained by NJ followed by TBR branch-swapping.
ML nonparametric bootstrap analyses used 100 heuristic
searches with starting trees obtained with NJ based on p
distances followed by TBR and nearest-neighbor interchange branch-swapping, saving all optimal trees. Bayesian inference was performed with MrBayes 3.1 [50] using
default parameters. Two independent parallel runs of
four incrementally heated Metropolis-coupled MCMCs
(Monte Carlo Markov Chains) were performed, with
trees sampled every 100 generations for 1000000 generations to the average standard deviation of split frequency
below 0.01. The first 10% of the trees were discarded as
'burnin', and posterior probabilities were estimated for
the remaining saved trees. Trees were rooted with
sequences of M. daubentoni, M. lucifugus, M. adversus,

[GenBank: EU447268, U95342, U95341, U944765,
GU944764, GU936479, GU944763].
Demographic history

The population demographic expansion was tested by
mismatch distribution analysis and neutrality tests. Mismatch distribution analyses were implemented to detect
historical demographic expansions. Significant difference
from a model of sudden expansion was assessed using the
sum of squared deviations (SSD) and the Harpending raggedness index (r) with parametric bootstrapping (10000
replicates). Generally, a smaller and non-significant value
(PSSD and Pr > 0.05) indicated population expansion. We
estimated the time since expansion (t) with the equation ?
= 2 μkt [51], where ? (tau) is a parameter of the time to
expansion in units of mutations, μ is the mutation rate
per nucleotide and k is the number of nucleotides of the
sequence. Tajima's D and Fu's Fs (based on the infinitesite model) were sensitive to the population expansion.
Significant negative values of Tajima's D were interpreted
as non-neutral conditions. Negative values of Tajima's D
and Fu' Fs significantly deviated from "0", inferred as a
signal of demographic expansion. All analyses were conducted with ARLEQUIN 3.1 [44].
With a coalescent-based approach, the program MDIV
was used to estimate the timing of population divergence
[52]. MDIV was implemented using a 'finite model'
(HKY), with 5000000 Markov chain iterations and a 25%
burn-in. Mmax and Tmax were set to 10 and 5, respectively. The divergent times (t) were estimated using the
formula t = Tpop*(θ/2 μk), where Tpop is the time of population divergence, θ is the population mutation rate, μ is
mutation rate per nucleotide, and k is the number of
nucleotides of the sequence. Likelihood values for Tpop
and θ were calculated and the value with the highest posterior probability accepted as the best estimate [14]. The
program was run multiple times with different random
seeds to obtain consistent distribution results.
We used a mutation rate of 20% per million years (Myr)
in our study, which was previously applied to bats of the
genus Nyctalus [53]. The generation time was estimated
to be 2 years.
Population structure analysis

Genetic differentiation among populations was quantified by computing pairwise differentiation Φst for
mtDNA using ARLEQUIN 3.1 [44]. Fst was calculated
with GENALEX 6.0 for microsatellites [54].
To test for geographical genetic structure, analyses of
molecular variance (AMOVA) with 10000 permutations
were assessed according to the degree of differentiation
between regions (ΦCT), between populations within

Page 10 of 12

regions (ΦSC) and between all populations (ΦST) by using
ARLEQUIN 3.1 [44].
To compare patterns of structure obtained from
mtDNA haplotype data with those from multi-locus
markers, we used STRUCTURE 2.2 [55] to reconstruct
the hierarchical relationship among populations, as well
as to distinguish historical processes. We applied a mixed
model that allows for allele frequency correlation across a
set of K genetic clusters. We performed 10 replicate [15]
runs of structure for each value of K. We applied the
admixture model with a burn-in of 30000 and a run
length of 106. Summary outputs for each value of K were
then displayed graphically using DISTRUCT [56].
Assignment tests can be used to identify the source population of individuals, and individuals of unknown origin
can be pre-assigned to populations according log likelihood scores [57]. Therefore, we used assignment tests to
identify the origin population according to likelihoods
from genotypic data [57], which was implemented with
GENALEX 6.0 [54].
A Mantel test (10000 permutations) to assess the statistical significance of the correlation between genetic and
geographical distances was performed with IBDWS 3.14
[58], to understand the influence of geographical barriers
on population differentiation.
