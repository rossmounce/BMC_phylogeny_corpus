Abstract
Background: The saprophagous and coprophagous maggots of the drone fly Eristalis tenax
(Insecta, Diptera) have evolved the unique ability to survive in aquatic habitats with extreme
microbial stress such as drains, sewage pools, and farmyard liquid manure storage pits. Therefore,
they represent suitable models for the investigation of trade-offs between the benefits resulting
from colonization of habitats lacking predators, parasitoids, or competitors and the investment in
immunity against microbial stress. In this study, we screened for genes in E. tenax that are induced
upon septic injury. Suppression subtractive hybridization was performed to selectively amplify and
identify cDNAs that are differentially expressed in response to injected crude bacterial endotoxin
(LPS).
Results: Untreated E. tenax maggots exhibit significant antibacterial activity in the hemolymph
which strongly increases upon challenge with LPS. In order to identify effector molecules
contributing to this microbial defense we constructed a subtractive cDNA library using RNA
samples from untreated and LPS injected maggots. Analysis of 288 cDNAs revealed induced
expression of 117 cDNAs corresponding to 30 novel gene clusters in E. tenax. Among these
immune-inducible transcripts we found homologues of known genes from other Diptera such as
Drosophila and Anopheles that mediate pathogen recognition (e.g. peptidoglycan recognition
protein) or immune-related signaling (e.g. relish). As predicted, we determined a high diversity of
novel putative antimicrobial peptides including one E. tenax defensin.
Conclusion: We identified 30 novel genes of E. tenax that were induced in response to septic
injury including novel putative antimicrobial peptides. Further analysis of these immune-related
effector molecules from Eristalis may help to elucidate the interdependency of ecological adaptation
and molecular evolution of the innate immunity in Diptera.

Background
Eristalis tenax belongs to the hover flies, family Syrphidae
(Diptera), with more than 5,000 described species, which
occurred late in evolution and radiated in the Early Tertiary [1]. In contrast to the predominantly flower-feeding

habitats of adult syrphids, their maggots are found in a
very diverse array of habitats. Those of subfamily Eristalinae are saprophagous, coprophagous and aquatic filterfeeders. Combined analysis of molecular and
morphological characters supports both frequent shifts

between larval feeding habitats within the Eristalinae and
the monophyly of this subfamily [2]. The rat-tailed maggots of E. tenax are characterized by their extended anal
breathing tube that functions as a snorkel and enables survival in waters with anaerobic conditions. They realize a
unique ecological niche by preferably living in stagnant
aquatic environments with high organic and microbial
contamination. Because of the preference of E. tenax larvae for dirty waters with anaerobic conditions, they are
reliable and prominent indicators in the biological assessment of water quality for extremely high pollution with
organic material [3]. They thus represent a suitable model
to investigate the trade-offs between the benefits resulting
from colonization of habitats lacking predators, parasitoids, or competitors and the investment in immunity
against microbial stress.
The innate immunity of insects relies on immediate processes including cellular phagocytosis, encapsulation,
hemolymph coagulation, and phenoloxidase activation
leading to melanization. On the other hand sustainable
defense is achieved by the massive synthesis of antimicrobial peptides like defensins and cecropins [4,5]. Insect
immunity has been best analyzed in the fruit fly D. melanogaster [6,7], but results of comparative genome-wide
analysis of immunity-related genes in D. melanogaster,
Anopheles gambiae, and Aedes aegypti reveal that effector
molecules from these dipteran species exhibit large variations [8]. For example, four defensin and four cecropin
genes exist in Anopheles, making these more numerous
than in Drosophila whereas some antimicrobial peptides
that were identified in Drosophila are absent in Anopheles
and Aedes [8]. The maggots of E. tenax have been recognized to be particularly resistant to microbial stress,
because they are able to survive in aquatic habitats that are
usually not colonized by other dipteran larvae or animals
[3]. Hence we were interested to identify the immunerelated genes of this insect.
To selectively identify immune-induced genes we used the
subtractive suppression hybridization (SSH) method
which amplifies differentially expressed cDNAs and
simultaneously suppresses amplification of common
cDNAs. This technique has been proven as a suitable tool
for identification of immune-related genes in insects [911] and other invertebrates [12,13]. Here, we report analysis of the immune-inducible transcriptome of E. tenax
maggots, collected from storage pits of liquid manure.
This enabled identification of genes encoding novel proteins that are potentially involved in pathogen-recognition and immune signaling. In addition, we identified
numerous potential antimicrobial peptides that most
probably contribute to the observed immune defense that
is obviously important to control the wide array of pathogens present in the habitat of Eristalis larvae.

Results and discussion
Subtracted cDNA library of immune challenged E. tenax
larvae
We observed a significant E. coli inhibitory activity of
hemolymph samples from untreated E. tenax larvae that
further increases upon immune challenge (Fig. 1). In
order to construct a subtracted cDNA library enriched in
immune-inducible genes we used purified RNA from LPS
injected and untreated animals combined with a PCRbased SSH method. To induce strong and broad immune
responses we injected a commercially available purified
LPS preparation, which is known to contain impurities
like nucleic acids, proteins and peptidoglycans, and which
according to the supplier is commonly used as elicitor of
immune responses in vertebrates and invertebrates. In
order to confirm that the subtraction process has been
performed efficiently, we analyzed the abundance of transcripts for the house-keeping gene α-tubulin and for two
genes, the Et-AMP10 and eristalin. The latter ones were
found in the present study to be induced in response to

immune challenge in Eristalis. Quantitative real-time PCR
analyses revealed that transcripts of α-tubulin were
reduced 18 fold, whereas transcripts of Et-AMP10 and eristalin were enriched for 4 and 38 fold, respectively (Fig.
2). This is in agreement with values from the protocols of
the manufacturer and indicates successful subtraction of
the cDNA library. A total of 288 clones were randomly
picked and subjected to colony PCR. Plasmids of 117 colonies that were positively screened in blot hybridization,
indicating induced expression in response to LPS challenge, were isolated and sequenced. The sequences
obtained (summarized in table 1) were deposited at
EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute, and compared
to databases of the National Center for Biotechnology
Information using the program BLASTX. InterProScan at
the EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute was used for
an integrated search in PROSITE, Pfam and PRINTS databases in order to predict conserved motifs, signal
sequences and transmembrane regions.

proteins in E. tenax that are potentially involved in recog-

nition of microbes, immune-related signaling, and antimicrobial effector mechanisms.
Sensing of infection
Innate immunity depends on pathogen recognition that is
mainly mediated by host proteins called pattern recognition receptors. In insects, two prominent members, the
Gram-negative binding proteins (GNBP) and peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRP) are involved in the activation of prophenoloxidase cascade and of Toll/IMD
pathways resulting in the massive production of immune
effector molecules [6]. Here, we identified transcripts of a
protein that shares sequence similarities with PGRP-SB1
from several Drosophila species (Fig. 3A). This peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) is one of a battery of pattern recognition proteins in insects that are essential for
recognition of invading microbes and induction of
immune responses [14]. Drosophila and Anopheles have 13
and 7 PGRP genes that are transcribed into at least 17 and
9 proteins, respectively [14]. Mammals possess a family of
4 PGRPs that function as both recognition proteins and
effector molecules exhibiting bactericidal activities [15]. A
Bayesian protein tree (Fig. 3B) was generated with
sequences from Eristalis, humans, D. melanogaster, and A.
gambiae and revealed that Eristalis PGRP groups nearest to
Drosophila PGRP-SB1.
Signaling
We identified a protein sharing highest similarity with the
relish protein of Glossina morsitans morsitans (Uniprot:
AAZ91474). Relish or Nuclear factor (NF)-kappa-B p110
subunit is a key molecule of the Imd pathway and is phosphorylated by LPS-activated I-kappa-B kinase complex
before being cleaved [16]. The Relish-p110 subunit is
cleaved within seconds after immune challenge into Relish-p49 and Relish-p68 subunits. The latter translocates
into the nucleus and activates the transcription of numerous immune-related genes [6]. The NF-kappa-B/I-kappa-B
signaling pathways are evolutionarily well conserved and
widely distributed among the animal kingdom [17].

cDNAs of α-tubulin, Et-AMP10, and eristalin in the subtracted cDNA library (gray bars) is shown relative to their
amount in unsubtracted cDNA library (black bars). The
cDNA amount of the house-keeping gene α-tubulin was
reduced about 18 fold by the subtraction procedure. In contrast, potentially immunity-related genes Et-AMP10 and eristalin were found to be 4 and 38 fold enriched in the
subtracted cDNA library, respectively. Results represent
mean values of three independent determinations ± S.D.

Many serine proteinase inhibitors have evolved in vertebrates and invertebrates to regulate vital serine proteinase
cascades. These contribute to melanization and host
defense responses in insects [18,19] as well as to hemostasis, fibrinolysis, and complement system in vertebrates
[20,21]. Here, we identified one proteinase inhibitor that
belongs to kazal-type serine proteinase inhibitors. Kazal
domains are characterized by a well-preserved amino acid
sequence containing three disulfide bridges, and display
varying specificity for serine proteinases [22].
One identified cDNA encodes a protein that exhibits highest sequence similarities to the replicase polyprotein of
the Drosophila C virus. This virus belongs to the picornavi-

rus family (enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses) that
also includes the prominent polio and foot-and-mouth
disease viruses [23]. However, it should be mentioned
here that the similarities between the sequences depends
mainly on a dsRNA-binding domain-like region. This
region is also present in a variety of cellular RNA-binding
proteins with different structures and diverse functions
including e.g. the human interferon-induced protein
kinase [24].

tein L1 fragment of Helicobacter pylori [26]. Additionally,
Park et al. [27] found that lysyl-tRNA synthetase was
secreted from intact human cells as a signaling molecule
to trigger proinflammatory response by binding to macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells to
enhance their migration and the production of TNF-α.
Since lysyl-tRNA synthetase is highly conserved in evolution it is possible that it also serves as a signaling molecule
in insects.

Protein biosynthesis and cell proliferation
We identified several transcripts of factors potentially
involved in Eristalis protein biosynthesis including ribosomal proteins S8 and L6, lysyl-tRNA synthetase, and the
translation initiation factor eIF5c. This is reasonable, since
the massive production of antimicrobial peptides upon
immune challenge depends on the activation of the cellular translation machinery in cells and tissues of the
immune system [9,13,25]. Nevertheless, one important
study reported the antibacterial activity of ribosomal pro-

One transcript shared high sequence similarities with the
evolutionarily conserved cellular repressor of E1A-stimulated genes (CREG). A finely-tuned balance exists between
cell proliferation, cell division arrest, and apoptosis in the
vertebrate immune response, and this may also be true for
insects. CREG is a secreted glycoprotein that inhibits cell
proliferation and enhances cell differentiation [28,29]. In
humans, CREG was shown to bind to the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor
II receptor, and this receptor has been shown to be

required for CREG-induced growth suppression. In
insects, CREG has been shown to be expressed in adult
female salivary glands of A. gambiae [30].
We found one transcript that exhibits similarity to the carboxyl terminus of α-tubulin from other organisms.
Although α-tubulin is a major constituent of microtubules and a well-known housekeeping gene, many genes
and pseudogenes exist that form the α-tubulin superfamily [31]. Induction of α-tubulin-like mRNA after
immune challenge has also been observed in leech [25],
and another study demonstrated that the dengue virus 2
directly binds to a 48 kDa tubulin or tubulin-like protein
of C6/36 mosquito cells [32]. These results suggest that at
least some α-tubulin-like proteins may be involved in

immune responses. However, in this study α-tubulin itself
was depleted by the subtraction process (Fig. 2) suggesting
that it is not immune-induced and the identified sequence
may be derived from a pseudogene or related isoform.
Effector molecules
The most striking finding among the genes inferred to be
up-regulated in response to septic injury is the identification of numerous putative antimicrobial peptides in E.
tenax. Defensins have been found in a variety of animals
and plants [33-35] and even in the fungus Pseudoplectania
nigrella [36], which is suggestive for an evolutionarily conserved role in innate immunity. In agreement, we identified an E. tenax defensin that we named eristalin. Eristalin
contains a predicted signal and pro-sequence and shares

sequence similarities to other insect defensins (Fig. 4A). In
addition, our phylogenetic analysis using sequences of
eristalin and other defensin sequences from dipterans suggests that the defensins of E. tenax, S. peregrina, and S. calcitrans are more deviated in sequence. Maggots of all three
of this species live on feces (Fig. 4B) suggesting that independent occupation of such 'extreme' ecological niches is
accompanied by divergent evolution of immune-related
effector molecules.
The putative antimicrobial peptide Et-AMP2 shares highest similarities to bactenecin-7 (Fig. 5) a cathelicidinderived antimicrobial peptide of bovine neutrophil granules that exhibits antibacterial activity predominantly
against gram-negative bacteria [37]. Bactenecin-7 belongs
to the Pro/Arg-rich antibiotics [38] which also include
porcine PR-39 [39], insect drosocin, abaecin, and lebocin
[40]; however, no homologues were identified in
humans. The antibacterial effects of Pro/Arg-rich peptides
are likely due to an impaired function of the respiratory
chain and of energy-dependent activities in the inner
membrane of susceptible microorganisms [41].
ET-AMP3 shows high similarity to the antimicrobial tachycitin of the horseshoe crab [42] and ET-AMP4 to the salivary protein SG3, with as yet unknown function, from
Anopheles stephensi [43]. Et-AMP5 is a cationic peptide
with putative α-helical content and with similarities to
cecropins or to antimicrobial cathelicidin-derived peptides like bovine BMAP-27 [44]. Et-AMP6, 7, 8, and 9 are

putatively disulfide-bridged cationic peptides, while EtAMP10 is a putatively disulfide bridged anionic peptide.
None share similarities with any known proteins or peptides but all exhibit Lys/Arg clusters in the proximity of
hydrophobic clusters; this is typical for many antimicrobial peptides [4].
We also identified four isoforms (Et-AMP11 to 14) of glycine-rich peptides with a glycine content of over 20% (Fig.
6). The list of glycine-rich antimicrobial peptides is rapidly growing and includes prominent members like the
antifungal holotricin-3 from the chafer Holotrichia diomphalia [45], the antibacterial acanthoscurrin from the spider Acanthoscurria gomesiana [46], and the antibacterial
armadillidin from the crustacean Armadillidium vulgare
[47]. Interestingly, the observation that several isoforms
of a glycine-rich peptide are present in a single organism
is in agreement with the identification of infectioninduced glycine-rich peptides in C. elegans [48] and of
putative glycine-rich attacins in the lepidopteran Antherea
mylitta [49]. Similarly, we identified five isoforms (EtAMP15 to 19) of a linear peptide that are cationic with a
glycine content of over 10% and share sequence similarities to the carboxyterminal half of bacterial outer-membrane porins and to a putative antimicrobial peptide from
the bug Riptortus clavatus [50] (Fig. 7).

acids represent a predicted signal sequence. The amino-terminal end of Et-AMP12 is not complete.

and the putatively disulfide-bridged anionic peptide EtAMP10 were 14 and 34 fold, respectively, up-regulated
upon LPS injection (Fig. 8). The determined induction
levels are in a similar range as reported for defensins from
other insects [51]. In contrast, the expression of the housekeeping genes actin and tubulin were not influenced by
the treatment.

Conclusion
In the present study we analyzed the immune-inducible
transcriptome from rat-tailed maggots of the drone fly E.
tenax which have evolved the ability to survive in stagnant, frequently anaerobic aquatic habitats with extreme
microbial contamination [3]. Survival in environments
with such a strong microbial stress obviously depends on
an innate immune system that has been adapted specifically to this ecological niche.
To date, seven distinct antimicrobial peptides have been
reported from Drosophila, including the antifungal peptides drosomycin and metchnikowin, and five antibacterial peptides: attacin, cecropin, defensin, diptericin and
drosocin [40]. Recently, genome-wide studies with Drosophila, Anopheles, and Aedes reveal that intracellular components of immune signaling pathways are conserved
among Diptera [8]. In accordance, we identified potential
counterparts in E. tenax that mediate non-self recognition
(e.g. PGRP) or immune-related signaling (e.g. relish) in
Drosophila and Anopheles. However, genome-wide studies
also elucidate differences between both dipterans, particularly in potential extracellular components of the Toll
pathway and in effector molecules including antimicrobial peptides [8]. In agreement, we identified numerous
putative antimicrobial peptides in E. tenax that have obvi-

ously no homologues in D. melanogaster,A. gambiae, or A.
aegypti. In total, we found 19 putative antimicrobial peptides some of which show sequence similarities to antimicrobial defensins, bactenecin-7, or tachycitin. 16 peptides
are of novel-type including four isoforms of a glycine-rich
peptide and five isoforms of a linear peptide. The isoforms
may have been evolved by gene duplication and evolutionary selection to target a variety of pathogens, probably
in a similar manner to that described for the six αdefensins and four β-defensins from humans [52].
Interestingly, we observed a significant E. coli inhibitory
activity of hemolymph samples from untreated E. tenax
larvae. This was not normally the case with hemolymph
samples from other insect species that we analyzed in our
laboratory (e.g. Thermobia domestica [9], Galleria mellonella
[10], and Tribolium castaneum). This significant (probably
constitutive) expression of antimicrobial peptides might
be caused by the uptake of food with a high bacterial load.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that Drosophila gut
cells are able to sense bacteria-contaminated food which
induces epithelial immune responses [6]. Thus, there may
be an even richer assembly of immunity-related genes in
Eristalis that would not be detected by our SSH approach.
Future work will include chemical or recombinant production of the identified peptides in order to analyze their
specific activities against viruses, bacteria, fungi, or protozoa. Currently, we are investigating the potential of EtAMP10 and eristalin to confer resistance against phytopathogens in transgenic plants similar as recently
shown for the antifungal peptide gallerimycin from the
greater wax moth Galleria mellonella [53]. In addition, the
identified genes may help to elucidate divergent evolution
of antimicrobial peptides in Diptera and the interdepend-

0.4 × 20 mm needles mounted on a microapplicator. For
antibacterial activity assays, hemolyph samples were isolated by bleeding injected larvae 24 h post challenge or
untreated larvae into plastic tubes. Total RNA was
extracted from whole larvae 8 h post injection using the
TriReagent isolation reagent (Molecular Research Centre,
Cincinnati, Ohio, USA) and a further poly-(A)+ RNA preparation was performed using a mRNA Nucleotrap kit
(Macherey Nagel, Germany) according to the instructions
of the manufacturers. RNA integrity was confirmed by
ethidium bromide gel staining and quantities were determined spectrophotometrically [55].

ence between ecological adaptation and insect immune
defenses.

Methods
Insects
Rat-tailed maggots were collected in liquid manure pits at
cattle farms near Giessen (Hessen) and the village
Siewisch (Brandenburg), Germany. Using a practicable
key for determination of hoverfly larvae [54], we identified third instar larvae of the drone fly E. tenax. As typical
characters we observed the lack of setae along the lower
lateral margins and the last pair of prolegs with most of
the large primary crochets facing towards the lateral margins of the body. Identification was confirmed by determination of adults which hatched at the end of October
2005.
Immune challenge of larvae and isolation of hemolymph
and mRNA
Last instar E. tenax larvae, each weighing between 200–
300 mg, were used for immune-challenge. 10 µl sample
volume, corresponding to 100 µg LPS (purified Escherichia

Antibacterial activity assay
Antibacterial activity of hemolymph samples was measured by an inhibition zone assay using a LPS-defective,
streptomycin- and ampicillin-resistant mutant of
Escherichia coli K12 strain D31 [56]. In brief, Petri dishes
(∅ 100 mm) were filled with 7 ml E. coli suspension, containing 2× YT-nutrient broth (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany),
1% high-purity agar-agar (Roth), and 2 × 104 viable bacteria in logarithmic growth phase. Holes with a diameter of
4 mm were punched into the agar and filled with 3 µl of
cell-free hemolymph. The diameters of the clear zones
were measured after 24 h of incubation at 37°C and units/
ml were calculated using a calibration curve obtained with
dilutions of gentamycin (Sigma).
Construction of a subtracted cDNA library using the SSH
method
In order to identify differentially expressed genes during
immune response the SSH method was performed using
mRNAs from immune challenged and control larvae and
the PCR-Select cDNA Subtraction Kit from Clontech
(Mountain View, CA, USA), according to the protocol of
the manufacturer. Briefly, 1 µg of purified mRNA from
immune-challenged and control larvae were reverse transcribed into cDNA using a cDNA synthesis primer, subsequently double stranded cDNA was generated and
digested with RsaI. The double stranded cDNA from
immunized larvae was ligated in separate aliquots to
adaptor 1 or adaptor 2R and were denaturated at 98°C for
90 s and then hybridized at 68°C for 8 h with a 30 fold
excess of double stranded cDNA from control larvae. Subsequently, both samples were mixed together again with a
10 fold excess of freshly denaturated double stranded
cDNA from control larvae and hybridized in one tube at
68°C for 16 h. The sample was then subjected to two
rounds of suppression PCR with PCR-primer 1 and nested
primers supplied with the kit. PCR amplifications were
performed in a total volume of 25 µl using a PCR cycler
(Biometra, Göttingen, Germany) with a heated lid and the

Advantage PCR system (Promega, Mannheim, Germany).
An initial adapter extension at 72°C for 5 min was followed by a denaturation step at 95°C for 1 min and by 27
cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15 s, annealing at 66°C
for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 90 s. A final 7-min
72°C step was added to allow complete extension of the
products. The secondary PCR was performed with nested
primer 1 and 2R on the diluted primary PCR products for
12 cycles under same conditions, except that 68°C was
used as annealing temperature. The subtraction efficiency
was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR of the actin
gene of subtracted PCR products in comparison to not
subtracted PCR products. Resulting PCR products of the
secondary subtractive PCR were separated on 1% (w/v)
agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining, according to standard procedures [55] and five fractions were obtained by excising five gel pieces of PCR
products with different lengths. Subsequently, PCR product fractions were separately purified using the NucleoSpin Extract II kit (Macherey Nagel), ligated into pGEM-T
easy vector (Promega) and transformed into TOP10F'
cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The library was
plated on 2×YT agar plates containing 100 µg/ml ampicillin and incubated at 37°C for 16 h. A preliminary screen
of 15 colonies using the FastPlasmid Mini kit (Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany) followed by EcoRI digestion of isolated plasmids and agarose gel electrophoresis showed
that over 90% of clones contained an insert in the vector.
Colony PCR and blot hybridization
Colony PCR was performed on 288 randomly picked colonies with vector specific primers T7-promotor: 5'TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3' and SP6: 5'-ATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3' (purchased from Thermo electron,
Waltham, MA, USA) using a Biometra PCR cycler and the
Red Taq PCR system (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany).
Used PCR conditions were: denaturation at 95°C for 3
min followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 15
s, annealing at 43°C for 15 s, and extension at 72°C for
60 s. A final 7-min 72°C step was added to allow complete extension of the products. 1 µl of resulting PCR
products were identically spotted onto two sheets of positively charged nylon membranes (Roche, Lewes, United
Kingdom). Membranes were dried and UV cross-linked
using a BioRad UV cross-linker (BioRad, München, Germany), according to the instructions of the manufacturer.
Digoxigenin labeled probes for hybridization were generated using secondary PCR products of subtracted and
non-subtracted cDNAs and the Dig-High Prime Labelling
kit (Roche, Lewes, United Kingdom). Hybridization,
washing, and detection of digoxigenin labeled DNA was
performed in accordance to the user guide instructions of
the Dig Easy Hyb Granules, Dig-Wash and Block Buffer
Set, Anti-Digoxigenin-AP and NBT/BCIP ready-to-use tablets (Roche).

Sequencing and computer analysis of cDNA sequence data
Plasmid isolation of 117 positively screened colonies was
performed with the FastPlasmid Mini kit (Eppendorf) and
purified plasmids were custom sequenced by Macrogen
Inc. (Seoul, South-Korea). Sequences were used to identify similar sequences of the National Center for Biotechnology Information databases using BLASTX program
(BLASTX 2.2.13; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).
InterProScan http://www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan/ was
used for an integrated search in PROSITE, Pfam, and
PRINTS databases at EMBL-European Bioinformatics
Institute and to predict signal sequences and transmembrane regions.
Sequence alignments and phylogenic analyses
Sequence alignments were computed using the blosum62
algorithm
[57]
at
http://bioinfo.genopole-toulouse.prd.fr. For phylogenetic reconstruction, we used the
software package MrBayes 3.1.2 [58], which combines
Bayesian inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo convergence acceleration techniques known as Metropolis
coupling. The best fixed-rate model of amino acid evolution was determined by model jumping among nine possible models. The model with the overall highest posterior
probability was WAG [59] for PGRPs and Blosum62
model [60] for defensins. Generations were sampled with
the current tree saved at intervals of 100 generations. We
used convergence diagnostic (i.e., the standard deviation
of split frequencies) to determine whether the run length
was sufficient. The average standard deviation of split frequencies at 2 × 106 generations was 0.0076 for PGRPs and
at 107 generations 0.0023 for defensins, respectively. This
therefore indicated that the two chains that were run converged on similar results. The 50% majority rule tree presented here was constructed from all sampled trees with
the first 25% of all trees. Trees were visualized with
TREEVIEW 1.6.6 [61]. Posterior probabilities plotted at
the nodes can be interpreted as the probability that the
tree or clade is correct [62].
Quantitative real time RT-PCR
Quantitative PCR was performed with the real-time PCR
system Mx3000P (Stratagene, La Jolla, California, USA)
using the FullVelocity SYBR® Green QRT-PCR Master Mix
(Stratagene, La Jolla, California, USA), according to the
protocols of the manufacturer. In order to confirm the
subtraction efficiency of constructed cDNA library 1 ng of
unsubtracted and subtracted cDNA, respectively, was used
to amplify α-tubulin, Et-AMP10, and eristalin. Used primers were: the universal primers α-tubulin-forward: 5'GCCAACCAGATGGTCAA-3' and α-tubulin-reverse: 5'GCTTGGTCTTGATGGTG-3',
eristalin-forward:
5ATGGCTACATGTGATCTGCT-3', eristalin-reverse: 5'ACGGCAATTGCAGACT-3',
Et-AMP10-forward:
5'ATGGACCCTCTTCTGTGG-3', Et-AMP10-reverse: 5'-

TGGGCATCTGACAATA-3'. For gene expression analyses,
we used 100 ng total RNA per well and primers described
above. In addition, insect universal primers actin-forward:
5'-ATCCTCACCCTGAAGTACCC-3 and actin-reverse: 5CCACACGCAGCTCATTGTA-3' were used to amplify Eristalis actin. Primers were selected using the primer3 software [63] and were purchased from Thermo electron
(Waltham, MA, USA).
