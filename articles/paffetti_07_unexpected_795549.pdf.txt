Abstract
Background: Phylogeographic analyses on the Western Euroasiatic Fagus taxa (F. orientalis, F.
sylvatica, F. taurica and F. moesiaca) is available, however, the subdivision of Fagus spp. is unresolved
and there is no consensus on the phylogeny and on the identification (both with morphological than
molecular markers) of Fagus Eurasiatic taxa.
For the first time molecular analyses of ancient pollen, dated at least 45,000 years ago, were used
in combination with the phylogeny analysis on current species, to identify the Fagus spp. present
during the Last Interglacial period in Italy.
In this work we aim at testing if the trnL-trnF chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) region, that has been
previously proved efficient in discriminating different Quercus taxa, can be employed in
distinguishing the Fagus species and in identifying the ancient pollen.
Results: 86 populations from 4 Western Euroasistic taxa were sampled, and sequenced for the
trnL-trnF region to verify the efficiency of this cpDNA region in identifying the Fagus spp..
Furthermore, Fagus crenata (2 populations), Fagus grandifolia (2 populations), Fagus japonica, Fagus
hayatae, Quercus species and Castanea species were analysed to better resolve the phylogenetic
inference.
Our results show that this cpDNA region harbour some informative sites that allow to infer
relationships among the species within the Fagaceae family. In particular, few specific and fixed
mutations were able to discriminate and identify all the different Fagus species.

Considering a short fragment of 176 base pairs within the trnL intron, 2 transversions were found
able in distinguishing the F. orientalis complex taxa (F. orientalis, F. taurica and F. moesiaca) from the
remaining Fagus spp. (F. sylvatica, F. japonica, F. hayataea, F. crenata and F. grandifolia). This permits
to analyse this fragment also in ancient samples, where DNA is usually highly degraded.
The sequences data indicate that the DNA recovered from ancient pollen belongs to the F. orientalis
complex since it displays the informative sites characteristic of this complex.
Conclusion: The ancient DNA sequences demonstrate for the first time that, in contrast to
current knowledge based on palynological and macrofossil data, the F. orientalis complex was
already present during the Tyrrhenian period in what is now the Venice lagoon (Italy).
This is a new and important insight considering that nowadays West Europe is not the natural area
of Fagus orientalis complex, and up to now nobody has hypothesized the presence during the Last
Interglacial period of F. orientalis complex in Italy.

Background
Fossil analogs of modern Fagaceae family are well represented in the Northern Hemisphere, indicating long-term
presence and differential patterns of species diversification throughout the Tertiary and Quaternary period [1-3].
In Italy during the Tyrrhenian, the last interglacial period
which started around 130,000 years ago, palaeontological
and palynological data support the existence in the
Veneto-Po Plain of a mixed forest of Colchic type dominated by fir-trees (including Abies nordmanniana (Steven)
Spach) and pine-trees, together with the broad-leaved
trees Zelkova Spach, Quercus L., Ulmus L., Tilia L., Carpinus
L., Corylus L., Fagus L., Betula L. and Castanea Miller [4-6].
Although a complete agreement has not been reached,
most authors indicate that the Fagaceae family includes
nine genera: Fagus L., Castanea L., Castanopsis Spach.,
Chrysolepis Hjelmquist, Colombobalanus (Lozano, Hdz-C.
& Henao) Nixon & Crepet, Formanodendron (Camus)
Nixon & Crepet, Lithocarpus Bl., Quercus L., and Trigonobalanus Forman [7]. Most genera are in temperate forests of
the Northern Hemisphere, and they show a hot-spot of
diversity in tropical zones of the Southern-East Asia [7].
The Fagaceae family has been extensively studied at the
genetic [8,9], biogeographic and phylogeographic [10-19]
level. Thanks to macrofossils richness several taxonomic
and macroevolutionary studies have been performed as
well [20-27]. Despite this, the taxonomic subdivision in
the Fagaceae family is still controversial, due to the small
number of prominent characteristics of the fruit and floral
[28-30].
The traditional classification of beech in Western Eurasia
recognizes one species, F. sylvatica with two subspecies F.
s. sylvatica and F. s. orientalis, and two intermediary types,
F. moesiaca and F. taurica [31,32].

Fagus sylvatica L. is distributed in western, central and
southern Europe with marginal and isolated occurrences
in England, and Scandinavia. The natural range of F. orientalis is Asia Minor, the Amanus Mts. (Syria), the Elburz
Mts. (Iran), and Caucasus. Isolated occurrences of this
taxa outside the natural range were found in eastern Serbia, in Macedonia, in Banate, in Moldova, in Dobrudja,
and in central Bulgaria. Contact zones between the natural ranges of both taxa are reported in northern Greece
and Bulgaria [33]. Authors disagree about the taxonomic
position of Fagus taurica Popl. (Crimea) and Fagus moesiaca Czecz. (Balkan). F. taurica is considered by some
authors as the intermediate form between F. sylvatica and
F. orientalis, and by others as an independent species. Similar doubts regard the taxonomy of F. moesiaca considered
an independent species or, most frequently, the subspecies of F. sylvatica [33]. The description of these taxa has
been mainly based on the morphological traits of leaves
[33].
Standing the difficulties in discriminating closely related
taxa and the overlapping of their natural range, the molecular data by Manos and Stanford [34] provided the most
reliable phylogenetic reconstruction of Fagaceae family.
However, they presented limited data from European
taxa, which have been traditionally included in various
morphologically distinct groups. Also Denk and colleagues [32,35] tried to combine morphological and
molecular data to resolve the controversy within the western Eurasiatic taxa without succeeding.
From these statements it is clear that is still controversial
whether the two taxa (F. sylvatica and F. orientalis) are
really separated, and whether the intermediates are two
different taxonomic units (F. taurica and F. moesiaca).
Analysing populations of the Western Eurasiatic taxa F.
sylvatica (38 populations), F. moesiaca (6 populations), F.
taurica (5 populations) and F. orientalis (31 populations),

using the trnL-trnF chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) sequence
(composed: trnL intron, second trnL exon, and partial
sequence of the trnL-trnF intergenic spacer), that has been
previously proved efficient in discriminating Quercus entities [36], we aim at: (i) inferring relationships among the
species within the Fagaceae family; (ii) identifying the
Western Eurasiatic taxa; (iii) combining, for the first time,
phylogeny analyses on present Fagus spp. with molecular
analyses of pollen from Italian fossil specimens as old as
about 45,000 yrs before present.
In addition F. crenata (2 populations), F. grandifolia (2
populations) F. japonica [GenBank: AB046521], F. hayatae
[GenBank: AB046522], Quercus spp. and Castanea spp.
were analysed to better resolve the phylogeny inference
(see Additional file 1).

Results and discussion
Identification of Fagaceae family and species
The phylogenetic relationship among and within Quercus,
Castanea and Fagus genera belonging to Fagaceae family
have been inferred analysing the trnL-trnF cpDNA region
in several species and in several individuals (see Additional file 1).

The entire trnL-trnF cpDNA ranged from 797 bp in C. crenata Sieb. to 655 bp in F. crenata Blume. The multiple
alignment of the trnL-trnF region among the different species resulted in a sequence 889 bp long; the trnL intron
had a length of 505 bp, the second trnL exon had a length
of 50 bp, and the trnL-trnF partial intergenic spacer had a
length of 334 bp (see Additional file 2).

due to an insertion of 41 nucleotides within the intron
region (see Additional file 2).
The Kimura-81 model [41] with a proportion of invariant
sites (0.61) and a rate variation among sites (α value of
the γ distribution equal to 0.74) was selected as best-fit
model of sequence evolution and then employed in Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analyses (BI). Since
trees recovered by the three different methods, Maximum
Parsimony (MP), ML and BI, substantially display the
same topology, we show only the ML tree (Figure 1).
The different Fagus species were grouped in the same unresolved cluster, providing no information about their phylogenetic relationships. High bootstrap and Bayesian
posterior probability values are present only in the part of
the tree involving the separation between Castanea and
Quercus genera and inside the cluster of Castanea species.

The trnL intron belonging to intron I group is interesting
for RNA secondary structure that permits to conserve
active form for "autosplicing". These introns have different nucleotide primary structure, but the same secondary
structure is conserved from cyanobacteria, to algae, and to
plant. The conserved nucleotide regions are short four
sequences named P, Q, R, and S [37]. These sequences are
always present in the same order within intron, but the
distance among contiguous elements range from few to
hundred nucleotides [37]. The nucleotide conserved
sequences in trnL intron were identified in Quercus genus
by Paffetti et al [36]: P (TTCAGAGAAAC), Q (AATCCTGAGC), R (GTGCAGAGACTCAA) and S (AAGATAGAGTCC). In the present work the same sequences have
been found in Castanea and Fagus genera.
The intron and exon of trnL show few nucleotides changes
within Fagaceae family, particularly among the Castanea
and Quercus genera according to the low rate of chloroplast DNA variation within this family, as previously
shown for other cpDNA regions by several authors [7,3840]. The Fagus genus is divergent from the other genera

The phylogenetic reconstruction shows a subdivision of
the Fagaceae family in Fagoideae, Quercoideae and Castanoideae subfamily according to traditional systematic and
to data obtained by Manos and Steele [39] analysing
mitochondrial matK gene, but in contrast with the results
obtained by Nixon and Crepet [24] with macrofossil data.
Moreover, the results confirm a recent monophyletic origin of the Fagoideae subfamily and common origin (sister
subfamily) of the Quercoideae and Castanoideae confirming data obtained by Manos and Steele [39].
The region in the alignment ranging from position 1 to
180 can distinguish the genera (see Additional file 2). Particularly, the Fagus genus is distinguished from Quercus
and Castanea genera by four transversion (at sites 54, 78,
166 and 178) and by one transition at site 152. Moreover,
the Castanea genus is distinguished from Quercus genus by
one transversion at site 159.
A sequence comparative analysis of the trnL-trnF cpDNA
region has been done among all the Fagus spp. considered
(see Additional file 1).
The entire region ranged from 660 bp in F. sylvatica and in
F. grandifolia Ehrh., to 655 bp in F. crenata. The trnL intron
harbour some informative sites that allow to discriminate
the different species inside the genus, with the intergenic
region showing a higher variability at the intraspecific
level. These data confirmed the results of previous studies
on the genus Quercus, highlighting the usefulness of this
sequence for taxa identification [36].
These are the most informative sites: (i) a 41 bp insertion
(between positions 388 and 428) in the intron, and a 190
bp deletion (between positions 618 and 807) in the intergenic region characterise the genus Fagus; (ii) two transversions (site 116 and site 118) in the intron identify F.
sylvatica; (iii) two transitions (site 116 and site 118) in the
intron identify F. grandifolia; (iv) one transition (site 132)
in the intron identifies F. japonica Bl.; (v) one transversion
(site 439) in the intron identifies F. moesiaca; and (vi) two
transitions (site 593 and site 596) in the intergenic identify F. taurica (see Additional file 2). The transversion (A/
C) at site 140 is particularly interesting as it discriminates
the western Eurasiatic taxa from the others. It is to notice
that all the European taxa have an A, and the Asiatic species have a C. As also the other genus Quercus and genus
Castanea have a C in the site 140, this is indicating that
this base was present in the common ancestor of the
genus Fagaceae, and that its mutation to A occurred in
European Fagus more recently. Therefore, the Asiatic species are more ancient than the European ones. Moreover,
F. orientalis seems to be originated early from the other

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/S2/S6

European groups, as it presents an identical sequence to
the Asiatic ones except for the site 140.
It is possible to distinguish the F. grandifolia species from
Asiatic and western Eurasiatic taxa, and the Asiatic species
from western Eurasiatic taxa; among the latter F. orientalis,
F. moesiaca, F. taurica and F. sylvatica can be identified, and
F. orientalis can be regarded as the ancestral species in
European beech.
In comparison to previous works, the region analysed in
this study is able to discriminate the different Fagus species as some mutation are fixed and specific for each Fagus
species. Nevertheless, we also find that within Fagus spp.
the differences are very few suggesting that speciation
process within this group might be still in progress
[32,35].
Identification of ancient DNA
It is well known that DNA degradation processes pose
serious limits to the length of the fragments that can be
retrieved from ancient specimens [42]: only stretches of
DNA less than 200 bp can be confidently analysed. Therefore, considering the age of our sample, we decided to
amplify from ancient samples the trnL-trnF region ranging
from site 37 to site 215, namely the region that proved
useful to distinguish among the different genera (Quercus,
Castanea and Fagus) and also among the main taxa (F. sylvatica, F. orientalis, F. japonica, F. grandifolia) inside the
Fagus genus.

This region was first amplified by real-time PCR (qPCR) to
estimate the copy number of cpDNA in ancient sample for
the assessment of its authenticity.
A post-amplification melting curve analysis was carried
out to verify that artefactual products (primer dimers,
non-specific products) were not present within each reaction. A unique melting curve characteristic of our DNA
fragment (different dissociation curves are obtained if different size and base composition fragments are present, as
also showed by Pruvost and Geigl [43]) was obtained
indicating that the reaction was problem free.
We determined that the initial amount of genuine chloroplast molecules in the fossil sample is about 59,900 molecules/µl.
One pollen grain contains about 10,000 cpDNA molecules, and five Fagus pollen grains are present in 1 µl of
our sample (Paganelli, personal communication), so the
estimated copy number is of 50,000 genomes/µl; a value
very similar to the estimation made by qPCR. Therefore,
we can say that our result is reliable enough for a study
based on ancient DNA amplification [42].

The sequences of 176 bp obtained from fossil material,
dated older than 45,000 years before present (BP) and collected near Bocca di Malamocco (Venice, Italy) (see Material and Method), belong to Fagus genus, since they
display the informative transversions at sites 18 and 42.
All the 45 clones analysed showed the same nucleotide
sequences. The mutations present in these sequences are
characteristic of the Western Eurasiatic group due to the
presence of the transversion at site 105 position. Moreover, these sequences do not belong to F. sylvatica since they
show transversions (A/T) at both sites 81 and 83 (Figure
2).
Therefore, the results show that F. orientalis complex (F.
orientalis, F. taurica, F. moesiaca) and not F. sylvatica was
present in Val Padana (Italy) 45,000 years BP. These data
confirm the palynological data obtained by Calderoni
and colleagues [44], who was not able to discriminate
among the Fagus spp. for the limitation of the methods.
Therefore, our molecular data add new crucial information to the palynological data.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/S2/S6

Euroasiatic Fagus taxa and ancient pollen grouping
The same 37–215 cpDNA region was used to construct a
statistical parsimony network containing both ancient
and modern samples of F. sylvatica, F. moesiaca, F. taurica
and F. orientalis (Figure 3). Only 12 different haplotypes
were recovered out of the 81 specimens analysed (80
modern plus the ancient specimen) (see Additional file
3).

The network clearly shows that two major groups, separated by at least three mutational steps, can be identified.
The cluster A, comprising haplotypes from 1 to 9, is represented by the F. orientalis, F. moesiaca, F. taurica samples,
plus the ancient specimens and some F. sylvatica samples.
The cluster B, with haplotypes from 10 to 12, is formed by
samples referred only to F. sylvatica taxa.
It is evident that the cluster B is homogeneous confirming
previously data on F. sylvatica in western Europe [32].

The heterogeneity of cluster A is due to the presence of a
mix of taxa and it can be explained, at a first attempt, by
the length of the sequence used in the construction of the
network, which does not contain the informative sites
necessary to distinguish F. taurica and F. moesiaca from F.
orientalis.

and colleagues [46]. During the Saint Germain I (about
110,000-95,000, BP), beech represented a major component of the vegetation in central Italy. Pollen data revealed
that the Italian peninsula might have been an important
area for the survival of beech not only during the last glaciation, but also during previous interglacial periods [45].

Another source of apparent incongruence is the presence,
in this cluster A, of some populations, morphologically
described as F. sylvatica. In effect, the sequence analysis
showed that these populations have the typical sequence
of the F. orientalis.

Our results seem to confirm these hypotheses, adding the
new information that the F. orientalis complex was already
present.

Nonetheless, some authors already pointed out that some
central-south Italian populations look like the Balkans
peninsula ones [9,19]. This seems to be the result of an
ancient connection, during the Pliocene, between the Italian and Balkan peninsulas, as confirmed by previous
isoenzyme analyses. This connection might have favoured
gene flow and genetic admixture between the gene pool
originated from the two peninsulas [9].
Considering that fossil material analysed in this study
resulted belonging to the F. orientalis complex, another
hypothesis can be put forward: these taxa were present in
the Po valley 45,000 years BP. Therefore, we can hypothesize that during the interglacial period the F. orientalis
complex was the dominant forest vegetation in Italian
peninsula, and that the actual F. sylvatica populations
(located at Foresta Umbra, Monte Taburno, Laghi di Monticchio, Monte Pecoraro, Monte Basilicò) can be considered remains of ancient populations.
Previous studies already showed that these populations
are divergent from other F. sylvatica populations. In fact,
the presence of unique haplotypes in central-southern
populations was previously demonstrated [19].
Magri [45] suggested that beech populations might have
survived during the last glacial period at different locations in the Italian peninsula, so that no clear large-scale
migration trends can be recognised in southern and central Italy. The presence of populations displaying high
divergence in Central-Southern Italy may be associated to
the fact that beech populations persisted in these regions
since the middle Pleistocene, as also suggested by Follieri

The sporadic occurrence of F. orientalis in Greek and
Romania populations reported in previous work [9,33]
can explain the presence of some of these populations in
the cluster A.
Accordingly to the results of the network, we subdivided
our modern samples in two groups, F. orientalis-complex
(cluster A) and F. sylvatica (cluster B), comprising respectively 51 and 29 samples. Using the entire cpDNA
sequence of Fagus spp., 722 bp long, we submitted these
groups to specific population genetics analyses. The
genetic differentiation between F. orientalis-complex (cluster A) and F. sylvatica (cluster B) resulted very strong with
a Φst value equal to 0.67 (p < 0.001). The F. orientalis-complex (cluster A) is characterised by a value of allelic richness as three times as greater than that of F. sylvatica
(cluster B) (Table 1). The greater genetic diversity within
F. orientalis-complex (cluster A) is confirmed by another
measure not strictly dependent on the number of samples
being compared, such as the mean number of pairwise
differences: we see that the F. orientalis-complex cluster
has a value as twice as higher than that of F. sylvatica. We
applied two statistical tests for neutrality, Tajima's D and
Fu's Fs. Both tests gave statistically significant negative values only for the F. orientalis-complex (Table 1). Assuming
neutrality selection at the locus under study, these results
can be interpreted as a signature of a demographic expansion.
All these results can reinforce the hypothesis according to
which F. orientalis is the ancestral species in European
beech; as also previously hypothesize by the sequence
analysis. In fact, if we consider F. sylvatica a species derived
from the ancestral F. orientalis, this can partially explain its
reduction in genetic variability [47,48].

One general observation within Fagaceae is that sequence
divergence among and within genera is fairly low. This is
based on a variety of sources, including the cpDNA genes,
rbcL, trnK and matK [34,38,39], and the ITS region [7,13].
The various noncoding regions of cpDNA sequenced in
this study also reveal appreciably low levels of sequence
divergence between disjoint species of most of the Fagus
species. Estimating divergence times between species with
low sequence divergence can be problematic because of
low statistical power of relative rate tests and high levels of
standard error [49-51].
Calculation of divergence times using the highest estimate
of the rate of synonymous changes for rbcL (3 × 10-10) in
Fagaceae [38], calibrated using fossil data for the minimum divergence time of Castanea and Quercus (60 million years B.P.; see Crepet [2]), provides a rough guide to
estimate divergence times based on the noncoding
cpDNA sequences examined here.
We adopted a coalescent-based method specifically
devised for recent divergence events [52], which takes also
into account the contribution of gene flow subsequent to
the divergence event.
For Fagus, where roughly equal amounts of nucleotide
variation were obtained for cpDNA noncoding regions,
we calculated divergence times using the same substitution rate across the total amount of sequence. Values are
derived from two different mutation rates, slow and fast
which refers to the overall substitution rate (0.71 × 10-10)
and the synonymous rate (2.36 × 10-10) of Frascaria et al
[38], respectively. This suggests minimum and maximum
divergence between F. orientalis and F. sylvatica of about
1.7 million and 5.74 million years BP (Table 2).
Even using the slowest mutation rate, it turns out that the
two species diverged recently. The method we adopted
allowed us to exclude that the relative low amount of
divergence can be attributed to an older event of splitting
followed by moderate gene flow.

Conclusion
We can conclude that at the end of Tertiary period the
ancestral F. orientalis complex was present in Italy, and
that only at the beginning of the Pliocene F. sylvatica
became differentiated from F. orientalis, slowly turning to
a predominant role among the Fagus species in West
Europe.
The analysis of DNA from samples dated before the Last
Glacial Maximum, allowed us to provide a direct demonstration that this event dramatically affected the distribution of forest trees such as the beech.
To better understand how and why the F. sylvatica became
predominant in comparison to F. orientalis in western
Europe more extensive molecular study on fossils remains
from different geographic area and from different ages is
required, combining the results with palynological and
paleoclimatic data.

Methods
Samples
Plant material
The number, distribution, source, and the GenBank accession numbers of trnL-trnF cpDNA region of individuals
analysed are reported in Supplementary material (see
Additional file 1).

Considering that the genetic variability and biogeography
of these taxa, have been extensively studied [9-19], and
that our purpose was to analyse the phylogenetic inference within this European group, we prefer to analyse as
much populations as possible for each species in the
attempt to adequately cover their wide natural range.
Fossil material
The fossil material was collected from sediments of the
deep levels ranging from 48.97 m to 50.79 m of a drill,
59.95 m long (Figure 4). It was pulled up from the sea
ground, located at 6.90 m below the sea level, near Bocca
di Malamocco (lat. 45° 20' 00" N, long. 12° 19' 36" E), in
a position corresponding to one of the three natural pas-

sages connecting the Venice Lagoon to Adriatic Sea [53].
Sediments were previously submitted to three kinds of
observations by Calderoni et al [44]: palaeo-environmental analysis, radiocarbon dating, and palynological analysis to obtain information about vegetation and climate
evolution in the investigated area. Palynological analysis
was carried out on 49 levels, mainly including clay with
peat and sand layers (Figure 4). The most conserved sediments, from the palynological point of view, were those
consisting of peat and clay layers [44]. The extraction of
"sporomorphs" were only performed from thirty-two
samples according to the method described by BertolaniMarchetti [54].
Ancient DNA analysis
Authentication methods
DNA is generally present only in small amounts in ancient
samples, and it is often damaged. Therefore, extreme preDEPTH
(m)

cautions are needed to minimize the risk of amplifying
and typing modern contaminating DNA molecules. To
maximize the probability of extracting and sequencing
authentic DNA from the ancient samples, the strictest
available standards were followed throughout this study.
We have applied the following criteria to authenticate any
amplified DNA sequences recovered from fossil samples
[55,56].
Physically isolated work area. Fossil suspension and PCR
were done in a working area sterilized by UV radiation
and exclusively dedicated for this analysis. The investigators of the study wore body protection, gloves and face
mask throughout the entire pre-PCR and PCR work.

2. Reproducibility. All results were identical in two independent laboratories.
3. Phylogenetic consistency. Amplified sequences showed
unambiguous affinities with other Fagaceae sequences in
a phylogenetic analysis, and therefore are phylogenetically consistent with their supposed Fagaceae origin.
4. Cloning. In total 57 clones were analysed and only 45
showed the expected fragment amplified. Therefore, 12 of
57 clones were excluded from the analysis as carrying partial or ambiguous fragments.
5. All results were identical in two independent extractions and two independent amplifications using four different overlapping primer pairs.
6. To explore if the number of templates was large enough
(>1000) to obtain reproducible results, a quantitative Real
Time PCR experiment was performed on the 176 bp fragment of the trnL-trnF chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) region.
All work was performed in isolated areas of Molecular
Genetic Laboratory in Sesto Fiorentino (IGV-CNR) and in
Molecular Anthropology Laboratory in Florence (DBAGUNIFI) where modern pollen DNA analysis have never
been performed.
In Molecular Genetic Laboratory (IGV-CNR, Sesto
Fiorentino)
Preparation of fossil samples for amplification
The working area, the disposable gloves, the automatic
pipettes and all other material used for PCR were sterilised
by exposition for 12 h to UV radiation (Atlas Germicidal
Lamp of 30 W) with an intensity maximum of λ 254 nm
at a distance of 67 cm from the working surface [57]. In
addition, the laboratory is positively pressured to avoid
the contamination with incoming external pollution (e.g.,
pollen, spores, etc.).

To diminish the steps in pre-PCR amplification, and,
therefore, the possibility of contamination, a modified
protocol respect to the one used by Suyama et al. [58] and
by Parducci et al. [59], who crushed the pollen grains in
PCR tube, was used.
The fossil pollen suspension was lysed by relying on temperature shock at high temperature as follow: 14 µl of 10fold dilutions from the fossil pollen suspension were put
in PCR tubes at -20°C until completely frozen, lysed at
95°C for 10 min, and then amplified by PCR.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/S2/S6

Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) conditions for ancient pollen
suspension
Amplifications were performed in a 20 µl volume containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin, 250 µM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1 µM of each primer, 14 µl of pollen
suspension, and 1 U of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase
(Invitrogen, CA, USA).

The 176 bp region was amplified using the following
primers: 37 5' GAGCCAAATCCTATTTTC 3' – 215 5'
ATGCTTTCTGTAGTTTTGAT 3'. After incubation for 60 s
at 90°C and for 90 s at 95°C, the reaction mixtures were
subjected to different cycles by using the following temperature profiles: 1) 95°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, 72°C for
4 min, for 5 cycles; 2) 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C
for 4 min, for 5 cycles; and 3) 95°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30
s, 72°C for 4 min, for 25 cycles. Amplification products
were then incubated at 72°C for 10 min. A Perkin Elmer
9700 thermocycler was used.
Amplification products (20 µl per lane) were analyzed by
gel electrophoresis on 1% (w/v) agarose gel (Invitrogen,
CA, USA) at 10 V/cm for 2 h in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer
containing 0.5 µg/ml (w/v) of ethidium bromide [60].
The gels were photographed and analyzed with an UVP
scanner (Photo-Capt, Vilbert Coormat, France).
Quantitative estimation
The estimated copy number of chloroplast ancient DNA
needs to be larger than the threshold value under which
sporadic contamination can be excluded and allows
assessment of the probability of its authenticity [43]. In
this study, we quantified the 176 bp cpDNA region.

The real-time PCR was carried out in a laboratory dedicated exclusively to fossil DNA work taking the necessary
precautions as above.
Real-time PCR (qPCR) amplification was performed in 50
µl using DyNAMO™ SYBR® Green qPCR Kit (FINNZYMES,
Finland) in Chromo 4™ Real-Time PCR Detector (MJ
Research, California, USA), and 0.5 µM of the appropriate
primers reported above. 2 µl of diluted 1:200 DNA
(extracted from fossil suspension material in the molecular anthropology laboratory) were incubated with 25 µl
master mix (2×) (hot start version of a modified Tbr DNA
polymerase, SYBER Green I, optimized PCR buffer, 5 mM
MgCl2, dNTP mix including dUTP) (Finnzymes, Finland)
and 40 U/ml UDG.
Thermal cycling conditions were 50°C for 2 min (UNG
treatment step): incubation with uracil-N-glycosylase
(UNG) to remove the uracil residues from potentially
contaminating DNA originating from previous amplifica-

tions. This step was followed by an incubation at 95°C for
15 min for UNG denaturation and to activate Tbr DNA
polymerase. Amplification was carried out for 60 cycles at
94°C for 45 s, 53°C for 1 min and 72°C for 1 min, followed by melting curve step. Two serial 10-fold dilutions
(E10 to E0) of the same fragment (external standard), previously amplified and purified, were included in each
experiment to generate the standard curve. The amplification efficiency of both standard and target molecules were
identical. At least two no-template controls were included
for each experiment.
Cloning and sequencing
The amplification products were purified using the Agarose Gel DNA Extraction Kit (Boehringer-Mannheim, Germany) following manufacturer's specifications. The 176
bp fragments, after gel purification, were cloned into plasmid vectors to randomly sample single molecules (Herrmann and Hummel 1984). The pCR®2.1-TOPO vector
(Invitrogen, CA, USA), and the TOPO™ TA Cloning® kit
(Invitrogen, CA, USA) were used. Sequencing of the
cloned fragments was performed in both directions from
independent amplification reactions using the dideoxychain termination method [61], the Sequenase kit (USB)
and the M13 universal primers.

The GenBank accession number of the 176 bp fragment
sequences is: DQ875545.
In Molecular Anthropology Laboratory (DBAG-UNIFI,
Florence)
DNA extraction
DNA was extracted from fossil material by means of a silica based protocol (modified from Krings et al. [62]; see
Caramelli et al. [63]); we performed two independent
extractions. A negative control was included in each
extraction.
Amplification
We amplify the a 157 bp fragment of the trnL-trnF cpDNA
overlapping the 176 bp region; the following primers
were used: 17 5' AATTAAAAATGGGCAATCCT 3' – 176 5'
AATAACGTAACGAAGTCAACC 3'. The following profile
was used to amplify 2 µl of diluted 1: 200 DNA extracted
from fossil material: 94°C for 10 min (Taq polymerase
activation), followed by 50 cycles of PCR (denaturation
94°C for 45 s; annealing 53°C for 1 min; and extension
72°C for 1 min) and a final step at 72°C for 10 min. The
50 µl reaction mix contained 2 U of Ampli Taq Gold
(Applied Biosystems), 200 µM of each dNTP, and 1 µM of
each primer.
Cloning and sequencing
PCR products were cloned using the TOPO TA Cloning kit
(Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instruc-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/S2/S6

tions. Screening of white recombinant colonies was
accomplished by PCR. The colonies were transferred into
a 30 µl reaction mix (67 mM Tris HCl [pH 8.8], 2 mM
MgCl2, 1 µM of each primer, 0.125 µM of each dNTP, and
0.75 U of Taq polymerase) containing M13 forward and
reverse universal primers. After 5 min at 92°C, 30 cycles
of PCR (30 s at 90°C, 1 min at 50°C, 1 min at 72°C) were
performed and clones with an insert of the expected size
were identified by agarose-gel electrophoresis. After purification of these PCR products with Microcon PCR devices
(Amicon), a volume of 1.5 µl was cycle-sequenced,
according to the BigDye Terminator kit (Applied Biosystems) supplier's instructions. The sequence was determined using an Applied BioSystems 3100 DNA
sequencer.
The GenBank accession number of the 157 bp fragment
sequences is: DQ875546.
Modern DNA analysis
DNA extraction
Total DNA was extracted from dormant buds, stored at 20°C, using the DNeasy plant kit (QiAgen, Germany) following the manufacturer specifications.
DNA amplification by PCR
Amplifications were performed in a 20 µl volume containing 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.001% (w/v) gelatin, 250 µM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 1 µM of each primer, 1 µl (10 ng) of
total DNA, and 1 U of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, CA, USA). The oligonucleotides used as primers
to amplify the trnL-trnF cpDNA region were the universal
primers (c and d) described by Taberlet et al [64]. The PCR
profiles are the same as above.
Sequencing
The amplification products were purified using the PCR
DNA purification Kit (QiAgen, Germany) following supplier's instructions. Direct sequencing of amplified DNA
was done in both directions from independent amplification reactions as above with the necessary modifications
for direct PCR sequencing.
Data analysis
The trnL-trnF cpDNA sequences were multiply aligned,
using the CLUSTAL-X program [65]. Alignments were verified and adjusted manually.

Phylogenetic inferences based on the cpDNA sequence
were conducted with maximum parsimony [65], maximum likelihood, ML [67] and Bayesian, BI [68] methods.
The best-fit model of nucleotide substitution employed in
the ML and BI analyses was selected using the Akaike

Information Content [69] approach as implemented in
Modeltest 3.7 [70].
In the MP and ML analyses we adopted the TBR (Tree
Bisection Reconnection) branch-swapping algorithm with
respectively 150 and 100 random addition-sequence replicates. Robustness of the phylogenetic trees generated by
MP and ML was tested by using the non-parametric bootstrap [71] with 1000 pseudoreplicates. The above analyses
were performed with the software package PAUP* ver. 4.0
[72]. The BI analyses were carried out with the program
MrBayes ver. 3.0b4 [73]. The Monte Carlo Markov Chain
length was 3,000,000 generations with a sampling frequency of 100 generations. The log-likelihood values for
sampled trees were stabilized after almost 200,000 generations; we used the last 20,000 out of the 30,000 total
trees to estimate Bayesian posterior probabilities. From
these trees a 50% majority-rule consensus tree was constructed with PAUP* ver. 4.0 [72].
The portion of the cpDNA (site 37 to site 215: 179 bp)
amplified in the ancient sample was used to construct a
statistical parsimony cladogram [74] within all the Fagus
spp specimens. The statistical parsimony method joins all
pairs of sequences that have a probability of parsimony
greater than 0.95, that is the probability of having no
unobserved mutations. The cladogram was constructed
with the TCS ver 1.21 software [75].
Genetic differentiation was assessed by means of Φst
(using the Kimura-2parameters distance method with
gamma correction), the molecular analogue of conventional Fst [76]. We estimated Tajima's D [77] and Fu's Fs
[78] to test for neutrality. All the above analyses, together
with standard and molecular indexes calculation, were
run with the software package Arlequin ver 2.000 [79].
Allelic richness was calculated following the method
described in Comps et al. [16].
Classical methods do not usually allow to distinguish
whether a certain level of diversity between species/populations results from a recent divergence accompanied by
limited migration, or from a long divergence time during
which migration was substantial. A method that can
explicitly deal with this feature is that developed by
Nielsen and Wakeley [52]: this is a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo coalescent-based approach for obtaining maximum-likelihood estimates of three population parameters, θ (which is equal to 4Neµ, where Ne is the effective
populations size and µ the mutation rate), M (equal to
2Nem, where m is the migration rate between two populations), and T (equal to t/2Ne, where t is the time since
two populations diverged from the common ancestral
population). Assuming no recombination and a demo-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/7/S2/S6

graphic model of two populations of equal effective size
that split from a panmittic ancestral population at some
time, T, in the past, the method estimates the likelihood
of the demographic parameters given the (i) demographic
model, (ii) the data set (that is DNA sequences) and (iii)
a mutational model. In our case we employed the finitesite Hasegawa, Kishino and Yano model (1985), which
allows for recurrent mutations, differences in nucleotide
frequencies and a transition/transversion bias. Adopting
two mutation rates [38] we calculated Ne and then we
used this Ne value to retrieve T and M. To check the convergence of the ergodic averages we ran the program twice
starting from different seed numbers.
