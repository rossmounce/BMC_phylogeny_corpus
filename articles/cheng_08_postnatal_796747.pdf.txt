Background: Chimpanzee dental pulp stem/stromal cells (ChDPSCs) are very similar to human
bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hBMSCs) as demonstrated by the
expression pattern of cell surface markers and their multipotent differentiation capability.
Results: ChDPSCs were isolated from an incisor and a canine of a forty-seven year old female
chimpanzee. A homogenous population of ChDPSCs was established in early culture at a high
proliferation rate and verified by the expression pattern of thirteen cell surface markers. The
ChDPSCs are multipotent and were capable of differentiating into osteogenic, adipogenic and
chondrogenic lineages under appropriate in vitro culture conditions. ChDPSCs also express stem
cell (Sox-2, Nanog, Rex-1, Oct-4) and osteogenic (Osteonectin, osteocalcin, osteopontin) markers,
which is comparable to reported results of rhesus monkey BMSCs (rBMSCs), hBMSCs and
hDPSCs. Although ChDPSCs vigorously proliferated during the initial phase and gradually
decreased in subsequent passages, the telomere length indicated that telomerase activity was not
significantly reduced.
Conclusion: These results demonstrate that ChDPSCs can be efficiently isolated from postmortem teeth of adult chimpanzees and are multipotent. Due to the almost identical genome
composition of humans and chimpanzees, there is an emergent need for defining the new role of
chimpanzee modeling in comparative medicine. Teeth are easy to recover at necropsy and easy to
preserve prior to the retrieval of dental pulp for stem/stromal cells isolation. Therefore, the
establishment of ChDPSCs would preserve and maximize the applications of such a unique and
invaluable animal model, and could advance the understanding of cellular functions and
differentiation control of adult stem cells in higher primates.

Background
Human DPSCs (hDPSCs) were first reported in 2000 [1]
and were categorized as post-natal stem cells. DPSCs are
capable of differentiating into osteogenic lineages with
functions similar to those of osteoblasts [1-3]. A recent
study demonstrated the expression of bone markers in
DPSCs, including bone sialoprotein, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and type-I collagen [1]. In addition,
like osteoblasts, hDPSCs can differentiate into adipocytes
[1,2]. Although the cell therapeutic potential of DPSCs
has not been fully investigated, additional evidence of the
multipotent differentiation potential of DPSCs has
strongly suggested that DPSCs are able to differentiate
beyond mineralized tissues [1,4-6].
The differentiation capacity and multipotency of DPSCs
could be greatly enhanced by the selection of a subset of
DPSCs based on cell surface marker expression and DNA
dyes exclusion [4,6]. DPSCs and BMSCs have similar gene
expression profiles, although their ability to differentiate
varies [7]. Recent discoveries suggest that BMSCs are capable of stimulating neurogenesis through the release of
growth factors and the induction of local repair responses
[8,9]. Furthermore, BMSCs have also been considered to
be a potential treatment for tumors [10,11], neurodegenerative diseases [12,13], and diabetes mellitus [14].
Although there is evidence supporting the notion that
BMSCs have potential therapeutic applications, it is yet to
be determined whether DPSCs also have a therapeutic
function.
In addition to their 98% genetic similarity to humans
[15,16], chimpanzees also show similar cognitive and
behavioral characteristics [17-21]. These similarities are
sufficient to suggest a critical role for the chimpanzee
modeling of human medical conditions, such as Autoimmune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), Alzheimer's disease
(AD), cancer, malaria, and perimenopausal complications [16,22-24]. Although mouse, rat, fish and other animal models for these conditions have been developed, the
differences in physiology, genetics and pathology from
humans make it difficult to extrapolate findings to significant breakthroughs in human medicine [16,25-27]. Due
to the unique genetic and physiologic homology of chimpanzees to humans [16,28], chimpanzees have been
widely used in studies of hepatitis B and C viruses [29-33],
AIDS [34,35], reproduction [36-38] and behavioral development [18-20,39-41]. However, a chimpanzee model
for stem cell research has yet to be developed.
Stem cell research in chimpanzees has not been at the
forefront of the field due to limited access, limited availability and highly restricted usage of chimpanzees in
research. As delineated above, the unique characteristics
of chimpanzees, including a high genomic proximity and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/9/20

close pylogenetic relation with humans, indicate that
chimpanzee stem cells could lead to insights into the regulatory mechanisms of gene regulation and differentiation control in humans. There has been much interest in
embryonic stem (ES) cells, which have a well-defined differentiation capacity; human, monkey and rodent models
have provided an enormous amount of information for
comparative studies. However, the establishment of chimpanzee ES cells is not an easy task. DPSCs are easier to
obtain than ES cells, however there is much skepticism as
to whether or not DPSCs are true pluripotent cells that can
mature into fully functional cells from each germ layer
[1,4-6]. Similar to BMSCs, DPSCs are considered as a subgroup of MSCs with different differentiation capability.
Although BMSCs could also be recovered during
necropsy, DPSCs are alternative source of MSCs with distinctive features that make it a unique and valuable comparative model for elucidating the origin and
characteristics of MSCs and ASCs. The recent changes in
chimpanzee policy have further reduced the accessibility
of chimpanzees in biomedical research. Unlike other animal models, such as monkeys and mice, chimpanzees
provide a unique model for the potential discovery of
minute differences resulting from the speciation of gene
function in humans [23]. Thus, the scientific role of chimpanzees in biomedicine needs to be redefined, and a new
venue of chimpanzee modeling is necessary in order to
preserve this unique and important model for comparative medicine.
The present study is intended to develop an alternative
strategy to preserve and maximize the potential applications of a chimpanzee model for adult stem cell research.
Our goal is to evaluate the feasibility of establishing
ChDPSCs from post-mortem tissues and determine their
multipotent differentiation capacity through direct comparison with hBMSCs and cell surface antigen profiling.
We aim to develop ChDPSCs and determine if they can be
used as an alternative source of stem cells and serve a
novel comparative model in adult stem cell research,
which may lead to an increased understanding of stem
cell properties and differentiation control in higher primates.

Methods
Isolation and culture of ChDPSCs
An incisor and a canine tooth of a forty-seven year old
female chimpanzee, euthanized for clinical reasons at the
Yerkes National Primate Research Center, were recovered
during necropsy. The teeth were stored in DPBS on ice,
and delivered to the laboratory. The teeth surfaces were
cleaned and dissected at the cementum-enamel junction
to reveal the pulp chamber. The dental pulp was recovered
followed by digestion in 3 mg/ml collagenase type I (Invitrogen, Inc.) and 4 mg/ml of dispase (Invitrogen, Inc) for

one hour at 37°C [1]. The cell suspension was filtered
through a 70 μm cell strainer (Falcon, Inc) to recover the
single-cell suspensions. The single-cell suspensions of the
dental pulp were then cultured in a DPSC medium (αMEM) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum
(Hyclone, Inc), 100 μm L-ascorbic acid-2-phosphate
(Sigma, Inc), 2 mM glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin
and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen, Inc.), and incubated at 37°C with 5%CO2. Medium was replaced every
three to four days and cells were passaged at 70% confluence.
Culture of hBMSCs
hBMSCs were acquired from the Tulane University Health
Sciences Center. In brief, hBMSCs were cultured in αMEM (GIBCO/BRL, Grand Island, NY) supplemented
with 20% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Inc),
100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen, Inc.), 100 μg/ml
streptomycin (Invitrogen, Inc.), and 2 mM L-glutamine
(Invitrogen, Inc.). Cells were then cultured at 37°C with
5% humidified CO2. The hBMSCs were passaged and
maintained at low density. hBMSCs were re-plated at 50
cells/cm2 and were harvested at 70% confluence.
Proliferation rate of ChDPSCs
The proliferation rate of ChDPSCs was determined by cell
count and MTT assay (ATCC), which was performed every
five passages (P5, P10 and P15). For cell count: A total of
5 × 104 cells were plated in a 35 mm dish and a total of
three replicas for each cell line were prepared at P5, P10
and P15. At 96 hours post-seeding, ChDPSCs were harvested and a total cell count was determined. For MTT cell
proliferation assay: Cell proliferation was determined by
using the ATCC MTT Cell Proliferation Assay Kit. A total
of 5% or 10% of the ChDPSCs sample from the cell count
study was seeded in triplicates in a 96 well plate and cultured overnight. A serially diluted 293FT cell of known
number was plated in the same 96 well plate in order to
generate a standard curve for later normalization. Each
well was brought up to 100 μl total volume and cultured
overnight. On the following day, all ChDPSC wells were
replaced with 100 μl of fresh culture medium and 10 μl of
the MTT reagent was added to each sample and the blank
control. After four hours incubation, 100 μl of detergent
was added to each well, the plate was covered and kept in
the dark at room temperature overnight. Plates were
measured with an ELISA reader using an absorbance
wavelength of 570 nm on the following day. The readings
of the ChDPSCs were normalized by a standard curve
based on the 293FT cell and compared between different
passages.
Telomere length assay
To determine telomere length, the TeloTAGGG Telomere
Length Assay kit from Roche Applied Science was used. In

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/9/20

brief, genomic DNA was digested with a mixture of Hinf I
and Rsa I restriction enzymes. Digested DNA was then
separated in 0.8% agarose gel followed by depurination,
denaturation, and neutralization, transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane. The membrane was
hybridized with a DIG labeled telomere probe at 42°C.
Three hours later, the membrane was washed in a high
stringency buffer and incubated with Anti-DIG-AP solution. After the final wash, AP substrate was applied and
exposed on X-ray film.
Colony forming unit (CFU)
Colony forming unit was determined by plating 30 cells/
35 mm culture dish followed by 2 weeks culture in a
DPSC medium. Medium was replaced every three to four
days. After 14 days in culture, the cells were fixed in 100%
methanol for 20 minutes followed by 3% crystal violet
staining. Any colonies larger than 2 mm in diameter were
counted. The CFU equals the total number of colonies
divided by the initial number of cells multiplied by 100 as
a percentage.
Adipogenic, osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation
For adipogenic differentiation, the cells were seeded at 400
cells per 35 mm tissue culture dish and cultured for 11
days in DPSC medium. On day 11, the DPSC medium
was supplemented with 5.0 μg/ml insulin, 50 μM
indomethacin, 1 μM dexamethasone, and 0.5 μM IBMX,
which was subsequently replaced every three to four days
for three weeks. The culture was then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) followed by Oil-Red-O stain.

For osteogenic differentiation, the cells were prepared as
described for adipogenic differentiation until day 11. On
day 11, the DPSC medium was supplemented with 1 nM
dexamethasone, 50 uM L-Ascorbic acid 2-phosphate sesquimagnesium salt, 20 mM β-glycerolphosphate, and 50
ng/ml L-thyroxine sodium pentahydrate, and was subsequently replaced every three to four days for three weeks.
The culture was then fixed in 4% PFA followed by Alizarin
Red S stain.
For chondrogenic differentiation, 2.5 × 105 ChDPSCs were
centrifuged in a 15 ml conical tube at 1,000 rpm for five
minutes. The pellet was maintained in a DPSC medium
supplemented with ITS-plus premix (BD Biosciences) to a
final concentration of 6.25 ug/ml insulin, 6.25 ug/ml
transferrin, and 6.25 ng/ml selenious acid. Additionally,
5.35 ug/ml linoleic acid, 1.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μg/ml Ascorbate 2-phosphate, 40 μg/ml L-proline, 100 μg/ml Sodium pyruvate, 100 nM
Dexamethasone, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml
streptomycin and 10 ng/ml TGF-β3 (R&D Systems) were
also supplemented. Medium was replaced every three to
four days for four weeks. The pellets were then fixed in 4%

PFA overnight, and the paraffin-embedded sections (4–5
μm) were stained with Alcian blue.
RT-PCR
RNA from cell samples of ChDPSCs were prepared with
RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) for RNA purification and
RNase-Free DNase set (Qiagen) for the removal of
genomic DNA in the RNA sample. 1.5 ug of total RNA
were used to synthesize cDNA by SuperScript III Reverse
transcriptase (invitrogen). PCR was performed using a
specific primer set targeting stem cell markers: Oct 4

Flow cytometry analysis
Cell lines were divided into 15 FACS tubes (BD Biosciences) at 2 × 105 cells/tube and stained with FITC or PEconjugated anti-CD14, -CD45, -CD59, -CD73, -CD90, CD150, -CD166, -IgG1k, -IgG2ak (all from BD Pharmingen), or anti-CD18, -CD24, -CD29, -CD34, -CD44 (all
from BD Biosciences), or anti-CD105 (eBioscience). After
incubating 20 minutes at ambient temperature in the
dark, cells were washed with 2 mL FACS wash solution
(dPBS+1%BSA+0.1%NaN3) and centrifuged 5 minutes at
230 × g. Supernatant was removed and cells were fixed
with 1% formaldehyde (in dPBS). All data was acquired
using a FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson) and analyzed
using CellQuest (Becton Dickinson) and Flowjo software
(Treestar, Inc.).
Statistical Analysis
Data analyses were carried out by Student t-test.

Results
Isolation and proliferation rate of ChDPSCs
DPSCs have previously been isolated from humans and
other species, including mice and pigs [1,2,4]. Here we
reported the isolation of ChDPSCs from post-mortem
teeth of a forty-seven year old female chimpanzee. The
chimpanzee is one of the closest relatives to humans, and
ChDPSCs could serve as a powerful comparative model
for the study of stemness and differentiation control of
adult stem cells in higher primates. The teeth were
retrieved from a chimpanzee euthanized at the Yerkes
National Primate Research Center (YNPRC), acquired
through the tissue distribution program. ChDPSCs share
similar morphology to hBMSCs, which are long and spindle shaped (Figure 1a). Two ChDPSC lines were established from the dental pulp of an incisor (ChDPSC-1) and
a canine (ChDPSC-2). Both cell lines were capable of
forming colonies, with a colony forming unit of 33% and
31% for ChDPSC-1 and ChDPSC-2, respectively, which
suggests their capacity for self-renewal and propagation.
ChDPSCs have a high proliferation rate at initial and early
passages, which decreases gradually in culture (Figure 2).
ChDPSC-1 had a higher proliferation rate (11.43 ± 0.47
folds) at passage five compared to that of ChDPSC-2 (7.52
± 0.69 folds). However, the growth rate of ChDPSC-1
decreased significantly by passage 15 (1.37 ± 0.3 folds)
whereas the growth rate of ChDPSC-2 (5.13 ± 0.35 folds)
reduced more slowly (p < 0.05; Figure 2). The proliferation study was conducted using two different methods,
cell count and MTT proliferation assay, which revealed
consistent results.
Assessment of telomerase length in ChDPSCs
Telomere length is one of the most commonly used markers in aging studies. Telomere length decreases as cells
continue to divide in vitro and is a natural process in aging
[42]. In general, long telomeres (10–20 kb) are observed
in stem cells or cells that are vigorously proliferated [43],
whereas the length of telomeres in somatic cells is shorter
and ranges from 5–15 kb [44]. To determine the length of
the telomeres, a commercially prepared assay was used.
Longer telomeres were observed in earlier passages (P5),
and while the telomere length gradually decreased in later
passages (Figure 3), most of the telomeres remained
between 10–20 kb in length. This result is consistent with
the results of a prior proliferation study, in which a
reduced growth rate of ChDPSCs in culture was parallel
with a decrease in telomere length.
Expression of stem cell and differentiation markers in
ChDPSCs
In order to determine the multipotent differentiation
capability of ChDPSCs, the expression of stem cell specific
transcription factors was determined. In addition to stem
cell markers, the expression of differentiation markers,

such as osteonectin, osteocalcin, osteopontin which is
expressed in precursor osteoblasts, was also determined.
The expression of the stem cell (Nanog, Sox-2, Rex-1 and
Oct-4) and differentiation (Osteonectin, osteocalcin,
osteopontin) markers was confirmed in both ChDPSC
lines (Figure 4) by RT-PCR analysis using specific primer
sets. A similar expression pattern was also reported in
rBMSCs [42] and hDPSCs [1,2]. Our results suggested the
stem cell properties of the ChDPSCs, which were further
confirmed in the in vitro differentiation study.
Osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation
of ChDPSCs
Two of the main characteristics of stem cells are selfrenewal or self-propagation and competency for multipotent differentiation. Differentiation into osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages is considered to be a
trademark event of BMSCs [45] and DPSCs [1,2,7]. Both
ChDPSC lines demonstrated potential for osteogenic, adi-

pogenic and chondrogenic differentiation. The osteogenic
capability of ChDPSCs (Figure 1b) was comparable to
that of hBMSCs [45], hDPSCs [2] and rBMSCs [42].
Although the adipogenic capability of hDPSCs [1,2,7] has
not been clearly demonstrated, adipogenic differentiation
of ChDPSCs was clearly confirmed by the formation of fat
droplets (Figure 1c), which were morphologically comparable to that of hBMSCs. Furthermore, ChDPSCs were
also capable of differentiating into chondrogenic lineages
(Figure 1d). Here, we have confirmed the multipotent differentiation capability of ChDPSCs and that this capability is comparable to that of hBMSCs and hDPSCs.
Cell surface antigen profile in ChDPSCs
Besides the expression of stem cell specific transcription
factors and a multipotent differentiation capability, the
expression profile of a total of 13 cell surface antigens in
ChDPSCs and hBMSCs was determined and compared
(Figure 5). The cell surface antigen profiles of ChDPSCs

significant difference (P > 0.05).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2121/9/20

and hBMSCs were then compared with published profiles
of hBMSCs, hDPSCs and rBMSCs. In both ChDPSC lines,
more than 99% of the cells expressed CD29, CD44,
CD59, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD150 and CD166, common BMSC markers. However, markers specific for
hematopoietic cells, including CD14, CD34, and CD45,
were not expressed. Additionally, neither CD18 nor CD24
were expressed in either ChDPSCs or hBMSCs. These
results are consistent with previously reported phenotypes
of hDPSCs [7], hBMSCs [3], and rBMSCs [42]. In fact, this
study was composed of a larger panel of cell surface antigens, revealing an almost identical profile for ChDPSCs
and hBMSCs, including hBMSCs run in parallel as well as
a published profile of hBMSCs [3]. Based on the expression and distribution pattern of the cell surface antigens,
the homogeneity of the ChDPSC population was clearly
revealed and was similar to that of the hBMSCs.

Discussion
The rationale for the establishment of ChDPSCs may be
questioned, as DPSCs have already been established from
other species, including humans [1,2] and pigs [4,46].
One asset of chimpanzees as a model for humans is the
98% similarity of their genomes [16,23,26,27], making
the chimpanzee the closest living relative to humans; it

of passage increase. Left panel: ChDPSC-1; Right panel: ChDPSC-2.

junction between two exons with the upstream primer located at the 3'region of the leading exon; whereas, the down stream
primer was located at the 5'region of the following exon in order to minimize the possibility of a false positive or contamination of genomic DNA.

has even been suggested that the chimpanzee should be
re-categorized as homo rather than ape. However, the differences between humans and chimpanzees are the most
fascinating question that remains unsolved. Due to an
almost identical genomic composition, the dissimilarities
are most likely not merely a result of the genetic code but
due to a difference in regulatory control of specific gene
expression that emerged after the evolutionary split of the
two species [16,25-27]. Geographic and environmental
pressure has further accelerated the divergence of the two
species, resulting in the advanced speciation of selective
gene function in humans. [27,47,48]. This suggests that
the minute differences resulting from the speciation of
gene function in humans could be traced only in a genetically close relative, such as the chimpanzee, but not in
other more distantly related species, such as monkeys or
mice [23].
One example of the distinctness of the chimpanzee from
other NHPs is the sequence homology of the brain's Tau
gene, the key component of filamentous tau deposits in
human neurodegenerative diseases [23,25]. The chimpanzee brain tau was 100% identical to that of the human,
whereas the gorilla tau was only 99.5% similar, 99% for

gibbons, 98% for rhesus monkeys, 88% for mice and 74%
for chickens. Additionally, microarray studies on transcriptome in leukocytes and livers suggest that human
gene expression patterns are more similar to those of
chimpanzees than those of macaques [25]. These studies
reflect how the variation in sequence homologies and
expression profiles relates to a species' phylogenetic distance from humans. Moreover, the gene expression patterns in the brain demonstrate a unique correlation
between chimpanzees and humans that may not be
present between humans and other primates [15 ,23, 24,
49].
In vitro differentiation of DPSCs to a designated lineage or
cell type has been difficult because of the lack of knowledge in the area of differentiation control. Although tremendous effort has been invested in developing strategies
for in vitro-guided differentiation of DPSCs, the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain largely unknown.
Spontaneous and guided differentiation has enabled differentiation of hDPSCs to various cell types, including
adipocytes [1,2], osteoblasts [1,2], chondrocytes [1,2] and
neurons [4]. However, the lack of precise differentiation
control and limited homogeneity of the resulting cell

markers shared with BMSCs (CD29, CD44, CD59, CD73, CD90, CD105, CD150 and CD166). Furthermore, all cell lines
were negative for CD18 and CD24. Blue line: isotype control. Red line: marker of interest.

types suggest the need for alternate approaches, such as a
comparative study using DPSCs derived from a closer species that shares a similar evolutionary path to humans,
such as the chimpanzee. A comparative study could accelerate the process of identifying specific regulatory controls
that lead to a unique differentiation pathway.

DPSCs are considered to be a potential source of adult
stem cells (ASCs) because dental pulp is a vascular connective tissue similar to the mesenchymal tissues found in
bone marrow, placenta, muscle, and adipocytes [3,50].
BMSCs and DPSCs have similar gene expression patterns
(Figure 4) and cell surface antigen profiles (Figure 5) even
though they are two distinct populations of precursor cells

[7]. Although RT-PCR confirmed the expression of stem
cell specific transcription factors, we were not able to
detect at protein level by either immunocytochemistry or
western blot, We speculated the expression level of such
transcription factors is extremely low in ChDPSCs. Our
result also suggested whether the expression of such transcription factors is required for the maintenance of
somatic stem cell properties, which is consistent to prior
study on the role of Oct-4 in maintaining of somatic stem
cell property [51]. Moreover, DPSCs and BMSCs also have
similar biofunctions, such as suppressing T-cell functions
in the modulation of immuno responses [3]. According to
the current classification and criteria of BMSCs
[45,52,53], DPSCs are considered to have a lower differentiation potential, with variations in cell surface marker
profiles, compared to that of BMSCs [3]. However, the
results of our study demonstrated a highly comparable
profile between ChDPSCs and hBMSCs (Figure 5; Table
1). Although BMSCs and DPSCs share some common features, they do have different kinetics and differentiation
competences [3]. BMSCs are able to develop into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, myelosupportive fibrousstroma, and other tissue types; whereas DPSCs are capable
of developing into osteoblasts with limited evidence of an
adipogenic lineage in humans [1-3]. However, we have
demonstrated that ChDPSCs have a strong tendency to
differentiate into osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes (Figure 1). It should also be noted that a side-population of DPSCs has been shown to have a more potent
differentiation capacity [4]. It has been suggested that
DPSCs may represent a subgroup of MSCs at a different
stage of differentiation and are therefore committed to a
specific function, depending on the microenvironment in
which it resides, thus resulting in phenotypic variations
[3].

It is also interesting to note that there was difference in
growth pattern between the two ChDPSC lines. We speculated the diverse growth pattern between Ch-DPSC-1
and -2 may be related to the cell type of origin. The two
ChDPSCs were derived from the incisor (ChDPSC-1) and
the canine (ChDPSC-2) teeth of chimpanzee. The
ChDPSC-2 has a more consistent growth rate compared to
that of the ChDPSC-1 even they share similar pattern in
telomere properties and surface antigen profile. We speculated that canine teeth in species such as chimpanzee
continue to grow throughout life and the difference in
growth pattern may suggest the difference between teeth
type. Thus a comparative study on teeth types merits further investigation.
Compared to bone marrow, dental pulp is easy to access
[3], and proliferates at a higher rate (Figure 2). Although
the proliferation rate of ChDPSCs decreased after long
term passaging (Figure 2), the telomere length was
retained (Figure 3). Homogenous populations of DPSCs
can be easily isolated from the dental pulp of post-mortem teeth or those extracted for medical reasons throughout life [1-3]. Based on flow cytometry analysis of the
expression profile of cell surface antigens, ChDPSCs presented with high homogeneity (Figure 5; Table 1), which
suggests a homogenous population of DPSCs could be
established efficiently at early passages.
Furthermore, valuable and endangered species such as
chimpanzees, pandas, gorillas, and Siberian tigers, are
mostly housed in sanctuaries, research institutions or
zoos. Although these species are relatively uncommon in
biological studies, they may hold the key to understanding the role of evolution in cell specification and differentiation control. Unfortunately, it is difficult to collect
bone marrow, gametes, and other viable tissues from
these unique species for stem cell isolation; and it is practically impossible to collect embryonic stem cells (ESCs).
Primary cultures from the muscle, the liver, and the brain
could be established when tissue is retrieved at necropsy.
Unfortunately, the isolation of adult stem cells (ASCs)
may not be a practical approach, as most sanctuaries and
zoos are not equipped with the tools and skills for emergency recovery of bone marrow or brain tissues for stem
cell isolation. Specific preservation and retrieval procedures are often required, and isolation is usually performed immediately upon retrieval in order to have a high
recovery yield. Additionally, most ASCs are relatively low
in abundance and often difficult to isolate. The exception
is the isolation of BMSCs from bone marrow and cord
blood where efficient isolation procedures have been
established. Based on these reasons, the isolation of ASCs
is not possible for most of these species, unless arrangements have been well planned in advance. On the other
hand, the isolation of DPSCs from dental pulp is simple

and has a high success rate. Most necropsy facilities have
the tools for teeth retrieval and no special preservation or
handling procedures are required. Teeth could be
retrieved, preserved in saline, kept at 4°C, and would then
be ready for shipment. In fact, teeth preserved overnight at
4°C have a comparable isolation efficiency compared
with fresh dental pulp from monkeys (unpublished data).
Therefore, it is possible to recover DPSCs from valuable
and endangered species with no geographic limitations.
Stem cells from such species are invaluable research materials for studying differentiation control in species with
unique habitats and positions on the phylogeny tree.

Conclusion
In conclusion, DPSCs are easy to establish from the dental
pulp, capable of self-renewal, and differentiate to multiple
lineages. Although DPSCs are primarily considered to
have applications in paradontology, implantology, and
calcified tissue reconstruction [3,4,6,53,54], clinical application of DPSCs should not be limited to hard tissue engineering. It seems that DPSCs have a similar, if not
identical, potential to BMSCs [53], and therefore more
diversified clinical applications should be investigated.
Most importantly, ChDPSCs are valuable as a comparative model in ASC research, which may lead to insights
into the understanding of stem cell properties and differentiation control in higher primates, such as humans.
