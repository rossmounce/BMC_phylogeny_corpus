Abstract
Background: Three enterotoxins are implicated in diarrhoeal food poisoning due to Bacillus
cereus: Haemolysin BL (Hbl), Non-haemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe), and Cytotoxin K (CytK). Toxin
gene profiling and assays for detection of toxin-producing stains have been used in attempts to
evaluate the enterotoxic potential of B. cereus group strains. B. cereus strain NVH 391/98, isolated
from a case of fatal enteritis, was genetically remote from other B. cereus group strains. This strain
lacked the genes encoding Hbl and Nhe, but contains CytK-1. The high virulence of this strain is
thought to be due to the greater cytotoxic activity of CytK-1 compared to CytK-2, and to a high
level of cytK expression. To date, only three strains containing cytK-1 have been identified; B. cereus
strains NVH 391/98, NVH 883/00, and INRA AF2.
Results: A novel gene variant encoding Nhe was identified in these three strains, which had an
average of 80% identity in protein sequence with previously identified Nhe toxins. While culture
supernatants containing CytK and Nhe from NVH 391/98 and INRA AF2 were highly cytotoxic,
NVH 883/00 expressed little or no CytK and Nhe and was non-cytotoxic. Comparative sequence
and expression studies indicated that neither the PlcR/PapR quorum sensing system, nor theYvrGH
and YvfTU two-component systems, were responsible for the observed difference in toxin
production. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis of 13 genes showed that NVH 391/98, NVH 883/00,
and INRA AF2 comprise a novel cluster of strains genetically distant from other B. cereus group
strains.
Conclusion: Due to its divergent sequence, the novel nhe operon had previously not been
detected in NVH 391/98 using PCR and several monoclonal antibodies. Thus, toxigenic profiling
based on the original nhe sequence will fail to detect the toxin in this group of strains. The
observation that strain NVH 883/00 carries cytK-1 but is non-cytotoxic indicates that the detection
of this gene variant is not a sufficient criterion for identification of highly cytotoxic strains. The
presence of the novel nhe operon and the cytK-1 gene variant in this cluster of strains reflect their
phylogenetically remote relationship towards other B. cereus group strains.

Background
Bacillus cereus is a common cause of bacterial foodborne
disease, characterized by either emetic or diarrhoeal syndromes [1]. Three chromosomally encoded toxins are
generally linked to diarrhoeal illness: Haemolysin BL
(Hbl) [2], Non-haemolytic enterotoxin (Nhe) [3] and
Cytotoxin K (CytK) [4]. Hbl and Nhe are three-component toxins composed of proteins L2, L1 and B, and NheA,
NheB and NheC, respectively. The genes encoding all
three enterotoxins are found to a similar extent in most
species of the B. cereus group [5,6], and their expression is
positively regulated by the PlcR/PapR quorum sensing
system [7,8].
B. cereus NVH 391/98, isolated in 1998 from an outbreak
causing fatal enteritis, has been shown to express neither
Hbl nor Nhe [9], and was the strain in which CytK was
first identified [4]. Phylogenetic studies have shown that
this strain is placed uniquely distant from main B. cereus
group clusters [10]. It is currently being subjected to complete genome sequencing by the DOE Joint Genome Institute (USA). We previously found that this strain carried a
particularly cytotoxic variant of the CytK protein, named
CytK-1, which partly explained why NVH 391/98 was
highly pathogenic [11]. Results also indicate that the high
cytotoxicity of this strain is a result of an exceptionally
high level of cytK expression [12]. In earlier studies, in all
other strains identified to carry cytK, the toxin existed as a
different, less cytotoxic variant, named CytK-2. Recently,
we identified two additional B. cereus strains carrying cytK1: NVH 883/00 and INRA AF2 [13]. In a study performed
to elucidate the genetic structure of the B. cereus group,
these three strains appear to constitute a cluster genetically
remote from all other tested strains (M-H. Guinebretière
and C. Nguyen-The, unpublished results). While NVH
391/98 and INRA INRA AF2 were highly cytotoxic, NVH
883/00 was in initial experiments shown to be non-toxic
towards Vero cells. The aim of this study was to investigate
and compare the strains of this rare genetic group, to
potentially gain insight into mechanisms responsible for
the dramatic differences in cytotoxicity between strains.

Results
Strains carrying cytK-1 have varying levels of toxicity
towards Vero cells
Supernatants collected from late log phase cultures of
strains NVH 391/98 and INRA AF2 grown at 32°C and
37°C, as well as strain NVH 391/98 grown anaerobically
at 32°C, gave 100% inhibition of protein synthesis in the
Vero cell assay, showing that these strains were highly
cytotoxic. In contrast, the supernatants tested from NVH
883/00, obtained from cultures grown at 37°C, 32°C,
and 25°C, the latter concentrated by a factor of 100, as
well as cultures grown anaerobically at 32°C, were shown
to have undetectable toxicity in this assay. To determine

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/43

whether differential CytK expression could be responsible
for the varying levels of toxicity, Western immunoblotting
of supernatants from all three strains grown at 32°C were
performed using CytK antiserum. The results presented in
Figure 1 show that NVH 883/00 expressed substantially
less CytK than did NVH 391/98 and INRA AF2.
A novel variant of Nhe was identified in all three strains
Both strains NVH 391/98 and NVH 883/00 were negative
in the Tecra and the Oxoid assays, which are commercial
kits that employ monoclonal antibodies directed against
NheA and Hbl component L2, respectively, to detect the
presence of Nhe and Hbl in B. cereus culture supernatants.
Furthermore, all three strains were negative in Western
immunoblots using monoclonal antibodies directed
against NheA and Hbl component B. However, strains
NVH 391/98 and INRA AF2, but not NVH 883/00, were
positive in a Western immunoblot using an antibody that
is reactive towards both NheB and Hbl component L1, giving a band of the same size as NheB (Figure 2). This was
quite unexpected as strain NVH 391/98 had previously
been shown to not contain the genes encoding Nhe [4,9].
PCR experiments using several sets of primers designed on
the basis of published sequences of nhe were positive for
all three strains with a few of the primer pairs used, thus
providing us with a starting point for obtaining the complete sequences of nhe in these strains (see Additional file
1). DNA sequencing of the nhe operons in strains NVH
391/98 and NVH 883/00 revealed a novel variant of nhe,
99.6% identical in DNA sequence between the two
strains. The deduced sequences of the three proteins comprising the Nhe toxin, NheA, NheB and NheC, from NVH
391/98 and NVH 883/00 were 77–81%, 87–88%, and
72–74% identical, respectively, to the corresponding protein sequences in B. cereus E33L, ATCC 14579, ATCC
10987, G9241, Bacillus thuringiensis serovar konkukian
str. 97–27, serovar israelensis ATCC 35646, and Bacillus
weihenstephanensis KBAB4. In comparison, the identities
between the Nhe proteins in this set of strains were 96–
99%, 97–100%, and 91–99%, respectively.

0075/95 and ATCC 14579 were used as controls; NVH
0075/95 does not contain hbl, while ATCC 14579 produces
both Nhe and Hbl. The results show that strains NVH 391/
98 and INRA AF2 produce NheB.

The PlcR transcriptional regulator cannot account for
varying levels of toxin expression
The PlcR/PapR quorum sensing system is presently the
only established regulator of extracellular virulence factors in B. cereus group strains [7,8]. Transcription of cytK
from strain NVH 391/98 has previously been shown to be
PlcR-dependent, even though the cytK promoter in this
strain contains a PlcR recognition sequence with one base
divergence from the currently defined PlcR recognition
sequence [12]. However, as the cytK promoter regions of
strains NVH 391/98 and NVH 883/00 are 100% identical,
differences in the promoter regions cannot account for the
differential expression of CytK in these two strains. Also, a
perfect PlcR recognition sequence was found upstream of
nheA in both strains NVH 391/98 and NVH 883/00.

To explore whether differences in the PlcR/PapR system
itself could be responsible for the observed differential
expression of CytK and Nhe, plcR and papR were
sequenced in strains NVH 391/98, NVH 883/00, and
INRA AF2. The deduced amino acid sequences of both
PlcR and PapR were 100% identical in the three strains.
Furthermore, the expression of PlcR was determined to be
of comparable level in all three investigated strains using
Western immunoblotting (results not shown).
YvrGH and YvfTU two-component systems are not
responsible for the varying toxin levels
Regulation of virulence gene expression by two-component systems has been described in a wide range of pathogenic bacteria [14]. A partial sequence encoding a
protein with homology towards the YvrG histidine kinase
in ATCC 14579 was previously identified to be located
upstream of cytK in NVH 391/98 [4], while in ATCC
14579, genes BC_5352 and BC_5353 encoding a putative
two-component system (yvfTU) are located upstream
from plcR [15]. As two-component systems sometimes

control the expression of genes located in the same locus,
we explored whether these two-component systems could
have a regulatory function explaining the observed differential expression of toxins. yvrGH and yvfTU were DNA
sequenced in both strains NVH 391/98 and NVH 883/00.
The deduced amino acid sequences of YvrH and YvrG
each differed with only one amino acid between strains
NVH 391/98 and NVH 883/00. A knockout mutant was
obtained in B. cereus ATCC 14579. Unfortunately, the
mutant could not be prepared in NVH 391/98, as all
attempts to transform this strain failed despite various
conditions used [12]. However, no difference between the
B. cereus ATCC 14579 wild-type and the yvrGH null
mutant could be observed in Western immunoblots
where culture supernatants were probed using CytK
antiserum, in the Vero cell cytotoxicity assay, or in transcriptional assays of cytK expression using lacZ fusions
(results not shown).
Unpublished results (by J. Brillard) indicate that a knockout mutant of the yvfTU two-component system in B.
cereus ATCC 14579 showed reduced expression of CytK
using lacZ fusions, compared with the wild-type strain.
However, the yvfTU locus located immediately upstream
from plcR was 100% identical in strains NVH 391/98 and
NVH 883/00. Reverse transcription (RT) PCR experiments
were carried out to assess whether or not YvfTU was
expressed in the low toxin-producing strain NVH 883/00.
The results in Figure 3 show that yvfTU was expressed in
all strains. Thus, neither the YvrGH nor the YvfTU twocomponent systems seemed to be responsible for the
divergent expression of toxins in the presently investigated B. cereus strains.

5'region of yvfU, indicating that these two genes were
expressed in a single operon.

The three investigated strains are genetically remote from
other strains of the B. cereus group
During the course of this study, 13 genes were DNA
sequenced in strains NVH 391/98 and NVH 883/00. It
became apparent that while all examined genes were of
high identity (> 99%) in NVH 391/98 and NVH 883/00,
their identity towards other B. cereus strains from which
DNA sequences are publicly available was typically
around 70–80%. Using PCR experiments, INRA AF2 was
confirmed to contain the same gene variants as NVH 391/
98 and NVH 883/00. A total of 47 PCR reactions were performed, covering all 13 investigated genes, using a combination of 62 primers specific to strains NVH 391/98 and
NVH 883/00 (see Additional file 1). To further study the
genetic relatedness of these three strains towards other
strains of the B. cereus group, multilocus sequence typing
(MLST) was performed, using partial sequences of the
seven housekeeping genes adk, ccpA, glpF, glpT, panC, pta,
and pycA. The MLST scheme used is from the University of
Oslo's Bacillus cereus group MultiLocus Sequence Typing
website [16], which is adapted from three previously published schemes [10,17,18]. The obtained sequences from
strains NVH 391/98 and INRA AF2 were 100% identical,
while the only difference between the sequences of these
two strains and NVH 883/00 were one nucleotide change
in each of panC and pta. Figure 4 shows the phylogenetic
tree prepared from the sequences obtained from the three
examined strains and the corresponding sequences from

other B. cereus group strains. The results clearly show that
strains NVH 391/98, NVH 883/00, and INRA AF2 comprise a genetically remote cluster of strains within the B.
cereus group.

Discussion
In the present study, we have investigated aspects of cytotoxicity, toxin production and regulation in a genetically
remote and rare collection of strains within the B. cereus
group. The original strain of this type, B. cereus NVH 391/
98, was highly pathogenic and the strain in which CytK
was first discovered [4], while the closely related B. cereus
NVH 883/00 and INRA AF2 are the only two other identified strains of this group.
We have identified a novel variant of the genes encoding
Nhe in all three investigated strains. Nhe was previously
undetected in NVH 391/98 [4,9], most likely due to the
high sequence divergence of the novel Nhe-variant as
compared with previously identified Nhe proteins. This
would result in lack of detection by PCR and by assays
employing monoclonal antibodies lacking cross-reactivity
towards epitopes on the novel Nhe variant. This is supported by the discovery by Dietrich et al. [19] that when
monoclonal antibodies were raised against NheB purified
from B. cereus B-4ac, 20 out of 25 of the obtained antibodies showed reactivity towards an exoprotein from NVH
391/98 of the same size as NheB.
While strains NVH 391/98 and INRA AF2 were shown to
be highly cytotoxic towards Vero cells and expressed high
levels of the toxins CytK and NheB, strain NVH 883/00
was shown to be non-toxic under all conditions tested,
with low or absent toxin expression. To date, these are the
only three strains that have been identified to carry the
cytK-1 variant [13]. The presence of CytK-1 was implicated
as the primary reason for the high pathogenicity of NVH
391/98, due to the greater cytotoxic activity of CytK-1
compared with the CytK-2 variant [11], and a particularly
high level of cytK-1 expression [12]. Although these factors certainly still seem valid, the identification of the
non-toxic NVH 883/00 carrying cytK-1 indicates that the
presence of this gene variant is not a sufficient criterion for
identification of highly cytotoxic strains.

It has been proposed that gene content plays a small role
in the diversity of phenotype and pathogenicity observed
between B. cereus group strains, and that subtle changes to
regulatory networks are of much greater importance [20].
Selected regulatory genes were investigated and compared, to potentially identify mechanisms responsible for
the differential expression of toxins in NVH 391/98 and
NVH 883/00. The PlcR/PapR quorum sensing system is
presently the only established regulator of expression of
extracellular virulence factors in B. cereus group strains

[7,8]. However, as the deduced PlcR and PapR proteins
were 100% identical between strains NVH 391/98 and
NVH 883/00, and the expression of PlcR was determined
to be of comparable level, we propose that additional regulatory factors are involved.
Two-component systems have often been shown to play
key roles in regulation of virulence in bacteria [14,21]. In
the current study, the possibility that two selected twocomponent systems, YvrGH and YvfTU, had a regulatory
function related to toxin production was explored. Both
were initially chosen for investigation based on their proximity to cytK-1 and plcR, respectively, as genes under the
control of a two-component system often map in the
vicinity of the regulatory genes [22]. However, neither the
YvrGH nor the YvfTU two-component systems seemed to
be responsible for the divergent expression of toxins in the
presently investigated B. cereus strains, even though YvfTU
has been implicated in positive regulation of CytK expression in B. cereus ATCC 14579 (J. Brillard, unpublished
results).
Phylogenetic analysis (MLST) of strains NVH 391/98,
NVH 883/00, and INRA AF2 compared to other B. cereus
group strains showed that these three strains comprise a
genetically remote cluster of strains within the B. cereus
group. Thus, the presence of the novel nhe operon and the
cytK-1 gene variant in these strains are intrinsic to the distant phylogenetic relationship towards other strains of the
B. cereus group. Previous phylogenetic studies by Sorokin
et al. [10] places strain NVH 391/98 rather far from main
B. cereus group strain clusters. Based on these data, one
could propose that the presently studied B. cereus strains
should comprise a novel species. The assignment of a new
species has probably been hampered by the fact that prior
to the current report, only one single strain of this cluster
(NVH 391/98) has been described, and perhaps that these
strains do not seem to be distinguishable from other B.
cereus strains based on traditional criteria such as morphology and phenotype.

Conclusion
We have discovered a novel Nhe variant in a rare group of
B. cereus strains, which has previously been undetected in
culture supernatants using PCR and methods based on
monoclonal antibodies, due to its divergent sequence as
compared with previously identified Nhe proteins.
Despite cytK-1 expression having been shown to be exceptionally high in strain NVH 391/98 [12], the presence of a
cytK-1 gene alone does not imply that the organism has
high pathogenic potential, since strain NVH 883/00 carries cytK-1 but is non-cytotoxic. However, the presence of
the novel nhe operon and the cytK-1 gene variant in strains
NVH 391/98, NVH 883/00 and INRA AF2 seems to be a
characteristic that is linked to their distant genetic rela-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/43

tionship towards other B. cereus group strains. Furthermore, we found no evidence that the PlcR/PapR system or
the YvrGH and YvfTU two-component systems are
responsible for the differing levels of Nhe and CytK toxin
expression between these strains. We therefore postulate
that there must be additional unidentified regulatory
mechanisms that are of significant importance for regulation of toxin expression in B. cereus.

Methods
Strains and growth conditions
B. cereus NVH 391/98 is a clinical isolate [4]. B. cereus
NVH 883/00 is an isolate from spices and B. cereus NVH
0075/95 is a food-poisoning strain, both submitted to the
Norwegian School of Veterinary Science, Oslo, Norway. B.
cereus INRA AF2 is an isolate connected to a food poisoning case, submitted to the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique, Avignon, France. B. cereus ATCC 14579
was used for construction of the yvrGH knockout mutant.
XL10-Gold E. coli (Stratagene) was used for recombinant
expression of CytK-1. B. cereus was grown in BHIG (brain
heart infusion supplemented with 1 % w/v glucose) at
32°C or 37°C and 200 rpm, from overnight cultures
diluted 1:100. Supernatants were collected by centrifugation. Supernatant from cultures grown at 25°C was concentrated 100 times by precipitation with 70% saturated
(NH4)2SO4. Anaerobic growth was performed as follows:
5 ml of BHIG was boiled in glass tubes to remove oxygen,
cooled, and inoculated with 50 µl of an overnight culture.
The tubes were incubated at 32°C under anaerobic conditions, and samples of supernatants were obtained after 6,
24 and 48 hours.
Cytotoxicity assays
Cytotoxicity was determined using a Vero cell test [23].
The assay monitors the inhibition of protein synthesis in
the cells by measuring the reduction of incorporated 14Cleucine in the Vero cells upon addition of toxin proteins.
100 µl samples of late log phase culture supernatants were
applied to the assay in duplicate. The B. cereus Enterotoxin
Reverse Passive Latex Agglutination test kit (Oxoid, Bassingstoke, England) and the Bacillus Diarrheal Enterotoxin
visual immunoassay (Tecra Diagnostics, Roseville, Australia) were used according to the manufacturers' instructions.
PCR and DNA sequencing of toxin and regulatory genes
Genomic DNA from B. cereus used as template in PCRs
was isolated using the method of Pospiech and Neumann
[24]. PCR products subjected to DNA sequencing were
obtained either by conventional PCR, inverse PCR, or
using the DNA Walking SpeedUp premix kit (Seegene).
DNA sequencing was performed on both strands and
sequences were submitted to GenBank, with the following
accessions for the NVH 883/00 sequences: [Gen-

strain NVH 391/98 in this study were identical to the corresponding sequences of the NVH 391/98 shotgun
genome sequence [GenBank:AALL00000000], except in
the case of the nhe operon, in which the complete
sequence was obtained in the current report [GenBank:DQ885236]. The plcR and papR genes from strain
INRA AF2 has the following accession: [GenBank:EF108376].
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis
The positions of coding sequences were predicted using
EasyGene [25]. The following genomic sequences were
used as reference strains: B. cereus ATCC 14579 [GenBank:AE016877], B. cereus ATCC 10987 [GenB.

israelensis ATCC 35646 [GenBank:AAJM01000000], and
B. weihenstephanensis KBAB4 [GenBank:AAOY00000000].
Pairwise alignments were calculated using the SmithWaterman algorithm [26].

MLST was performed using partial sequences of the genes
adk, ccpA, glpF, glpT, panC, pta, and pycA, ranging in length
from 330 to 444 nucleotides, according to the scheme
given at the University of Oslo's Bacillus cereus group MultiLocus Sequence Typing website [16]. PCR and DNA
sequencing was performed as described, with the exception that primer aagtaagggctaagaaga was used as the forward primer for amplification of glpT, and primers
ccaagggatataaagcgagatg and aatcaactataccgtttgtatttgc was
used for panC. The GenBank accessions for the sequences
from NVH 883/00 are adk; [GenBank:EF108377], ccpA;
[GenBank:EF108378], glpF; [GenBank:EF108379], glpT;
[GenBank:EF108380], panC; [GenBank:EF108381], pta;
[GenBank:EF108382], and pycA; [GenBank:EF108383].
The GenBank accessions for the sequences from INRA AF2
ccpA;
[Genare
adk;
[GenBank:EF108384],
Bank:EF108385], glpF; [GenBank:EF108386], glpT; [GenBank:EF108387], panC; [GenBank:EF108388], pta;
[GenBank:EF108389], and pycA; [GenBank:EF108390].
The sequences for strain NVH 391/98 were obtained from
the NVH 391/98 shotgun genome sequence [GenBank:AALL00000000], except in case of the adk locus, for
which the sequence was obtained in the current report
[GenBank:EF108391]. The reference strains listed above
were used for all loci, with the exception of glpF, which

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/7/43

was absent from the available shotgun genome sequences
of B. weihenstephaniensis KBAB4 and B. thuringiensis serovar israelensis ATCC 35646, and tuncated in B. cereus
G9241. The DNA sequences of all seven genes were concatenated, giving a sequence 2700 nucleotides in length,
and aligned using ClustalW. A phylogenetic tree was calculated using the neighbour-joining method, where
genetic distances were estimated using the Kimura model
and bootstrap confidence values were generated using
1000 permutations. The tree was printed using TreeView
[27].
Preparation of CytK antiserum
Recombinant CytK-1 for use in antiserum production was
expressed from the vector construct pMS20-cytK-1 previously described [11]. Cultures were grown in 2 litres of
modified CGY medium [28] containing 0.4 % glucose
and 50 µg ml-1 kanamycin, and incubated at 37°C for 5
hours. The harvested pellet was resuspended in 20 ml lysis
buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0, 1 mg
ml-1 lysozyme). Incubated on ice 30 minutes, and lysed by
sonication. 0.25 mg RNase A and 10 U DNase (Promega)
was added, followed by incubation on ice for 20 minutes.
Purification of CytK-1 protein from the supernatant was
performed as previously described [4]. A N2W rabbit was
immunized using four ~1 ml doses, administered in twoweek intervals, with a final bleeding six days after the
fourth immunization. Fresh protein samples were used
for each immunization.
SDS-PAGE and Western immunoblotting
SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide) and Western immunoblotting was carried out according to standard protocols [29].
For detection of enterotoxins by Western immunoblotting, 12 µl culture supernatant from late log phase cultures
grown at 32°C was applied. CytK antiserum was used at a
dilution of 1:500. For detection of PlcR, bacterial pellet
from 100 µl culture was suspended in SDS-PAGE sample
buffer and applied. The PlcR rabbit antiserum [30],
diluted 1:2000, was kindly supplied by Dr. Stephen Leppla, Maryland, USA. The secondary antibody biotin-goatanti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) was used at a 1:1000 dilution.
Monoclonal antibodies 1A8 against NheA [19], 2A3
against Hbl component B, and 1C2 against both NheB
and Hbl component L1 [31], used at dilutions of 1:15,
were obtained as a gift from Dr. Erwin Märtlbauer, University of Munich, Germany. For these blots, the secondary
antibody biotin-goat-anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) was used at a 1:500 dilution. All blots were incubated with a complex of streptavidin and biotinylated
alkaline phosphatase used at a dilution of 1:3000, prior to
development with a NBT/BCIP solution.

Construction of the yvrGH mutant
The yvrGH operon was interrupted by allelic exchange
with a kanamycin resistance gene (KmR) in B. cereus ATCC
14579 as follows: The regions upstream of yvrH and
downstream of yvrG were PCR amplified using tgcaggatccgttagcaaatcgccactact/tgcagtcgacatacgtagttcggattctcg and
tgcactgcagagaatggattaccggtctaac/tgcaccatggagggaagcaggttagtattgt, respectively. PCR products were digested with
BamHI/SalI and PstI/NcoI using primer-incorporated
restriction sites (underlined). KmR was PCR-amplified
from pDG783 [32] using primers tctggtcgaccatttgaggtgatagg and gctactgcagatcgatacaaattcctcgtaggcg, and digested
with SalI/PstI. The three digested DNA fragments were
purified, and ligated into NcoI/BamHI digested pMAD
[33]. The recombinant plasmid pMAD∆yvrGH was transformed into B. cereus ATCC 14579, transformants were
subjected to allelic exchange as previously described [33],
and the yvrGH mutant was confirmed by DNA sequencing.
cytK transcriptional activity
The cytK-promoter of B. cereus ATCC 14579 has previously
been cloned in pHT304-18'Z, giving a cytK'-lacZ transcriptional fusion [12]. The plasmid was transformed into B.
cereus ATCC 14579 wild-type and ∆yvrGH, and cells were
grown in LB medium at 37°C with shaking. β-galactosidase specific activities were measured in triplicate samples
from each culture as described previously [34]. Experiments were repeated twice.
RT-PCR of yvfTU
RNA extraction was performed using the FastRNA ProBlue
kit (Qbiogen) on strains grown at 37°C in LB medium
and harvested in stationary phase (OD600 = 1.4). RT-PCR
experiments were performed with the Titan One Tube RTPCR System (Roche), using 500 ng RNA in each reaction.
The primers used were either ttgtGaaAaatccagagcgtgc (for
ATCC 14579) or ttgtAaaGaatccagagcgtgc (for the three
clinical strains), and atccaatccactttgaatcggc. Diverging
nucleotides in the forward primer sequences are indicated
in uppercase.
