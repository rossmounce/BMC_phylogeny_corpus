Abstract
Background: Quantitative phenotypic variation of agronomic characters in crop plants is controlled by environmental
and genetic factors (quantitative trait loci = QTL). To understand the molecular basis of such QTL, the identification of
the underlying genes is of primary interest and DNA sequence analysis of the genomic regions harboring QTL is a
prerequisite for that. QTL mapping in potato (Solanum tuberosum) has identified a region on chromosome V tagged by
DNA markers GP21 and GP179, which contains a number of important QTL, among others QTL for resistance to late
blight caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans and to root cyst nematodes.
Results: To obtain genomic sequence for the targeted region on chromosome V, two local BAC (bacterial artificial
chromosome) contigs were constructed and sequenced, which corresponded to parts of the homologous chromosomes
of the diploid, heterozygous genotype P6/210. Two contiguous sequences of 417,445 and 202,781 base pairs were
assembled and annotated. Gene-by-gene co-linearity was disrupted by non-allelic insertions of retrotransposon elements,
stretches of diverged intergenic sequences, differences in gene content and gene order. The latter was caused by
inversion of a 70 kbp genomic fragment. These features were also found in comparison to orthologous sequence contigs
from three homeologous chromosomes of Solanum demissum, a wild tuber bearing species. Functional annotation of the
sequence identified 48 putative open reading frames (ORF) in one contig and 22 in the other, with an average of one
ORF every 9 kbp. Ten ORFs were classified as resistance-gene-like, 11 as F-box-containing genes, 13 as transposable
elements and three as transcription factors. Comparing potato to Arabidopsis thaliana annotated proteins revealed five
micro-syntenic blocks of three to seven ORFs with A. thaliana chromosomes 1, 3 and 5.
Conclusion: Comparative sequence analysis revealed highly conserved collinear regions that flank regions showing high
variability and tandem duplicated genes. Sequence annotation revealed that the majority of the ORFs were members of
multiple gene families. Comparing potato to Arabidopsis thaliana annotated proteins suggested fragmented structural
conservation between these distantly related plant species.

Background
The potato (Solanum tuberosum) is the most important
crop of the Solanaceae. It is a tetraploid, non-inbred,
annual plant species that is vegetatively propagated by
tubers. Polyploidy and inbreeding depression prevent the
generation of homozygous lines. When the ploidy level is
reduced from 4n to 2n, the diploid potatoes are self
incompatible. Potato genotypes at all ploidy levels are
therefore heterozygous [1]. The basic chromosome
number of potato is twelve and its genome size is in the
order of 800 to 1000 megabases, similar to the closely
related tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). Detailed RFLP
(restriction fragment length polymorphism) linkage maps
have been constructed for the twelve chromosomes [25,63], which were subsequently used to locate in the
potato genome factors controlling monogenic and polygenic traits of agronomic relevance such as resistance to
pests and pathogens or tuber quality (e. g. starch and
sugar content) (reviewed in [1,6]). When using the same
locus specific DNA-based markers in different mapping
populations, the positional information of the mapped
factors controlling qualitative and quantitative traits can
be compared and integrated. This comparison showed
that a number of the factors which control qualitative (R
genes) or quantitative resistance (QRL = quantitative
resistance loci) to different types of pathogens map to
similar positions. These chromosomal regions are socalled hot-spots for pathogen resistance. One of the most
conspicuous resistance hot-spots in the potato genome is
located on potato chromosome V, in a chromosome segment tagged by the DNA-based markers GP21 and GP179.
The 3 cM interval between GP21 and GP179 [7] includes
the R genes Rx2 and Nb both for resistance to Potato Virus
X [8,9] and the R1 gene for race-specific resistance to the
oomycete Phytophthora infestans causing late blight [10,7].
The same markers are also linked to QRL for P. infestans
[11-14] and QRL for the root cyst nematodes G. rostochiensis and G. pallida [15-18]. As shown by QTL mapping [1214,19,20], this region on potato chromosome V not only
contains genes for resistance to various pathogens but also
genes controlling plant vigor, plant maturity (the time the
plant needs from planting to reach maturity under long
day conditions), tuber yield, tuber starch and tuber sugar
content.
Two R genes from the chromosome V resistance hot-spot
have been functionally characterized, Rx2 for extreme
resistance to Potato Virus X [21] and R1 for resistance to P.
infestans [22]. Both R genes are members of the superfamily of plant resistance genes characterized by a coiled
coil (CC), a nucleotide binding (NB) and a leucine rich
repeat (LRR) domain [23], but otherwise share low
sequence similarity. R1 has been introgressed from the
allo-hexaploid – wild potato species Solanum demissum
into the cultivated potato germplasm pool [1,25] and is

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/112

one member of a clustered gene family in the GP21–
GP179 interval [22,25]. The molecular basis of the QRL
for late blight and root cyst nematodes in the same region
is unknown. One possibility is that alleles of the R1 and/
or the Rx2 gene, or other members of the R1 gene family
and/or another resistance-gene-like (RGL) family in this
genome region encode the factors for the quantitative
resistance phenotypes, similar to classical plant genetic
studies, where resistance loci with multiple specificities to
different races of a pathogen may be alleles of the same
gene, or tightly linked genes [11,26]. However, the resolution of QTL mapping in this region of the potato genome,
even when based on large populations related by descent
[27] is low. Genes physically linked to the R1 family, but
structurally and functionally unrelated to R1 or other
RGLs, cannot be excluded as candidates for the QRL of
interest. High resolution mapping and map-based cloning
of QTL based on recombinant inbred populations or near
isogenic lines [28] is not feasible in potato due to selfincompatibility. As an alternative approach, genomic
sequencing and annotation can provide information on
all putative genes present in the whole region, which then
might be further examined for function as quantitative
trait loci, first in silico by functional annotation and then
experimentally by analysis of natural allelic diversity of
positional candidates and complementation analysis
using candidate gene allelic variants [28]. Powerful bioinformatic tools for gene annotation [29] and functional
analysis of sequence related genes in model plants such as
Arabidopsis thaliana and rice can facilitate the selection of
functional candidate genes among all the positional candidates in a genome segment harboring QTL.
Parts of the genomic region corresponding to the GP21–
GP179 interval in S. demissum were sequenced and three
different haplotypes A, B and C equivalent to the three
homeologous chromosome pairs of S. demissum were
identified [25]. They demonstrated substantial structural
variation among the haplotype sequences. In this paper,
we report the genomic sequence analysis of two orthologous chromosome segments of the heterozygous, diploid
Solanum tuberosum genotype P6/210 in the same GP21–
GP179 interval. Two independent bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) contigs, corresponding to the homologous chromosomes of P6/210 were constructed,
sequenced and annotated, thereby extending the genomic
sequence information available in this functionally
important region of the potato genome. Comparative
sequence analysis revealed regions with severe structural
distortions and deviations from gene by gene co-linearity,
which are flanked by conserved regions showing
microsynteny with the A. thaliana genome.

Contig construction and BAC sequencing
The potato clone P6/210 used to construct the BAC libraries was heterozygous for R1 (R1/r1). Physical mapping in
the context of cloning the R1 resistance gene had identified overlapping BAC insertions that originated from the
homologous chromosomes carrying either the R1 resistance allele or an r1 allele for susceptibility [22]. In order
to obtain two contigs, one for each homologous chromosome in the R1 genomic region, the physical map was
extended. Subsequently, we refer to the two contigs as the
R1-contig and the r1-contig.

The R1-contig was extended proximally, starting from
BA27c1 by clone BC93c12 (Figure 1). This BAC was identified by PCR screening of the BC library using specific
primers that were developed based on the sequence of the
proximal BAC end of BA27c1. Additional 34 BACs from
this region, all containing one or more members of the R1
gene family, were identified by colony filter hybridization
using as probe a 1.4 kb DNA fragment amplified with R1
gene specific oligonucleotides 76-2sf2 and 76-2SR [22].
Among the clones containing R1 homologous genes were
BA132h9 and BA213c14. Clone BA132h9 overlaps with
BC93c12, and BA213c14 overlaps with BA87d17 (Figure
1). The gap between BA132h9 and BA87d17 was bridged
by clone BC136j5 (Figure 1). From the seven BAC clones
that constitute a minimal tiling path including the R1
locus, six BAC inserts were fully and one (BC93c12) was
partially sequenced (Table 1). The r1-contig consisted of
clones BA122p13 and BA76o11 and was extended proximally by clone BA111o5 (Figure 1). All three clones were
fully sequenced (Table 1).
Genomic sequence analysis
The 620, 226 kbp genomic sequence obtained from seven
R1- and three r1-BAC insertions was assembled into two
distinguished, unambiguous stretches of DNA sequence
corresponding to the R1- and r1-contig of 417,445 base
pairs [GenBank:EF514212] and 202,781 base pairs [GenTable 1: Summary of sequenced BAC insertions of genotype P6/

GC content in the R1- and r1-contig is 33.26% and
34.11%, respectively.
The two contig sequences share highly similar and collinear regions, but these are interrupted by more variable
regions (Figure 2). In addition, an inversion and an
inverted repeat were identified. Tandem repeats corresponding to six copies of R1 homologous genes in the R1
contig and three copies in the r1 contig were identified.
These repeats are embedded in a region of non-alignable
sequence.
For easier reference, we label regions along the R1 contig
from A to F (Figure 2) based on features revealed by comparison of the R1 with the r1 contig using MUMmer (Figure 2). For region A, no sequence was obtained from r1.
Region B is highly similar to the start of contig r1. In
region C, co-linearity and alignment are disturbed, and
similarity is primarily detected in three tandem repeats.
No similarity to r1 is detected in region D. Region E
(69,850 bp) again aligns well with r1, but in reverse orientation, indicating a genomic inversion. Region F, resembling region C, is not aligned well but contains two
tandem repeats that are highly similar to the tandem
repeats in region C, but in inverse orientation. Region B
contains a palindromic structure discussed in more detail
below.

could not identify a partner on R1. On average, one ORF
is annotated in every 9 kbp of genomic sequence. The
average GC content of exons is 39%.
A putative function was assigned based on similarity to
proteins of known function with an E-value smaller than
10-10 (Table 2, details in Additional file 5). Thirteen genes
are related to retrotransposons. Two multigene families, Fbox proteins and NBS (NBS-LRR) type resistance genes,
are represented by several members. Six proteins on contig R1 and three on r1 are members of the R1 gene family.
At least eleven F-Box proteins are found on R1, but none
of these are found in r1-contig.

Dot-Plot comparison done using MUMmer of the DNA
sequences of the R1- and r1-contig. Alignment between contigs starts at approximately 120 kbp in the R1-contig. The
DNA sequence between approximately 120 kbp and 200 kbp
of the R1-contig (B) was highly similar to the r1-contig and
included a palindromic structure of around 34 kbp. The
regions from 200 kbp to 245 kbp (C) and again from 375 to
400 kbp (F) of the R1-contig contained conserved repeated
sequences that were interrupted and flanked by sequences
with low similarity between the two contigs. Segment D
from 245 to 330 kb showed no similarity to the r1-contig.
The segment from 330 kbp to 400 kbp (E) of the R1-contig
was inverted relative to the r1-contig.

Comparison to the A, B and C haplotypes of the orthologous genome region in Solanum demissum [25] revealed
similar features (supplementary Fig. S3 and S4). The R1
contig is most closely related to the A sequence, with colinearity and high sequence identity (99%). However, we
orient BAC PGEC472P22 (accession AC151815) of A in
reverse orientation compared to [25], thereby introducing
the inversion of A and R1 relative to r1, B and C (see Discussion). The r1 contig is more similar to the sequences of
B and C haplotypes of S. demissum.
Regions A and B show co-linearity with the S. demissum
genomic regions II and III as defined by another study
[25], whereas regions C through F correspond to S. demissum genomic regions IV and V.
Gene content
We predict that the R1 contig contains 48 genes, seven of
which are transposons and three are pseudogenes. Thirteen protein coding genes on the r1 contig can be identified as orthologs of collinear genes on R1. However, on R1
there are two additional protein coding genes. Six transposon genes are specific to r1, and for one pseudogene, we

Where sequence from both contigs was available, most
proteins and some transposon-related genes are conserved between the R1 and r1 contig (Figure 1 and Additional file 5). Notable exceptions are 13 retroelements, six
of which were found only in the r1 contig (ORF 14/1, ORF
19/1, ORF 21, ORF 49, ORF 51 and ORF 53) and 7 in the
R1 contig (ORF 7, ORF 9, ORF 11, ORF 12, ORF 25, ORF
28 and ORF 40). The palindromic structure in region B is
formed by an inverted repeat of two highly similar RNAdirected RNA polymerases (ORFs 14 and 16), separated
by a hypothetical protein (ORF 15). The r1 specific retrotransposon 14/1 is inserted between the inverted repeats.
Region E contains five genes that are conserved between
R1 and r1 but in reverse order and orientation, indicating
a genomic inversion. The proximal two genes are members of the R1 family, ORF 44 being the functional R1
resistance gene (accession AF447489) and the following
ORF 45 is a tandem duplicate. ORFs 44 and 45 are conserved in sequence, but having inverse order and orientation, with resistance gene homologues 52 and 54 on
contig r1, suggesting that the inversion includes these two
genes. However, proteins 44 and 45 are more similar to
each other than to 52 or 54, indicating that they may have
arisen through tandem duplication after the inversion
event. Another resistance gene homologue (ORF 46) follows on contig R1, but is less similar to the other R1related genes. Also two genes (ORFs 47 and 48) could not
be related to any locus on contig r1. This suggests that the
proximal breakpoint of the genomic inversion in contig
R1 is after gene 44 or 45.
To map the distal breakpoint of the inversion event on
contig R1, we used sequence from S. demissum BAC
PGEC093P17 (accession AC149290), as the sequence of
contig r1 did not extend sufficiently far in proximal direction. The PGEC093P17 sequence contains orthologs of
proteins 43, 42, 41, 39 and 38 in the same order and orientation as found on contig r1, therefore inverted with
respect to R1. As in r1, the R1 specific transposon ORF 40
is not found in PGEC093P17 (Fig. 1). Proximal to protein
38 followed probable orthologs of proteins 37, 36 and 35

in reverse order and orientation compared to contig R1,
indicating that these three genes are part of the inversion.
The remaining PGEC093P17 sequence proximal to ORF
35 contains only transposon fragments and hypothetical
proteins, which are unrelated to genes distal to ORF 35
(mainly F-box genes, Table 2) in the R1-contig. This maps
the distal inversion breakpoint in contig R1 between
genes 34 and 35. As consequence of the inversion, genes
23 to 34 in the R1 contig are probably part of a region that
is, at least at this genomic location, R1 specific. This region
includes two R1 homologous genes (ORF 23 and 24) in
tandem orientation to ORF 22, two transposon-related
genes and a series of eight F-box genes. For the flanking
regions of contig R1, we found almost perfect gene-bygene co-linearity to r1 or PGEC093P17. We could not
assign three genes in contig r1 to any collinear region, two
of which are transposons and one resembles a fragmented
resistance gene.
Microsynteny with the A. thaliana genome
Five microsyntenic blocks were identified in A. thaliana
based on the arbitrary criterion of finding at least three
pairs of homologous protein sequences within a compa-

rable physical distance (Table 3 and Additional file 6).
When the potato annotated proteins were compared to
the A. thaliana annotated proteins, only ORFs 6, 8, 15 and
35 did not have any hit. Each member of the 'resistancegene-like' and 'F-box containing' gene families had more
than 30 hits. Due to the high copy number, these two
multigene families and the retrotransposons were not
considered when searching for groups of in both species
physically closely linked homologue pairs (microsynteny). The 26 remaining potato ORFs used for microsynteny analysis had on average 9.2 hits in the A. thaliana
genome. The five syntenic blocks involve three sections
within the potato contigs, (i) the distal ORFs 2, 3, 4 and 5,
(ii) ORFs 17, 18 and 19 in the middle part and (iii) ORFs
38 to 48 in the proximal region. The syntenic blocks I, II
and III comprise between 215 kbp and 405 kbp potato
sequence and are syntenic with three different, smaller A.
thaliana genome fragments from 7 kbp to 54 kbp on chromosome 1. The four consecutive A. thaliana genes in block
I have the same relative orientation of transcription and
the same order as the homologous potato ORF 17, 19, 43
and 41 in the r1-contig (Table 3, Figure 1). The largest syntenic region identified in both species is block III, includ-

ing 7 potato ORFs, which spans nearly the whole R1contig (405 kbp). The corresponding A. thaliana genome
fragment is 54 kbp in size and contains 12 annotated
genes, seven in the same order and homologous to ORFs
in the r1-contig, one F-box gene (At1G69630.1) and four
other, consecutive genes that are not syntenic
(AtG69650.1 to AtG69680.1). Block II with four syntenic
ORFs is second in size (345 kbp). The related A. thaliana
genome fragment of only 18 kbp contain five annotated
genes, four homologous to the potato ORFs and the fifth
one different (AtG26860.1). Potato ORFs 2, 4 and 5
(block IV) and 2, 3 and 5 (block V) are located within 25
kbp in the R1-contig. The A. thaliana genome fragment IV
on chromosome 3 is larger (106 kbp), whereas fragment
V on chromosome 5 is nearly identical in size (28 kbp).
The three ORFs in block V are not only located in genomic
fragments of similar size in both species but also in the
same order and in the same orientation of transcription. It
is unlikely that the five syntenic blocks occur by chance
only. We estimate the probability of finding three hits
within 100 kb in A. thaliana to be less than 10-3 using an
approximation described in [4]: hn × (0.1 Mbp/121
Mbp)n-1, where h is the average number of hits of the
potato genes in A. thaliana (9.2), n the number of genes
conserved in the syntenic block (3), 0.1 Mbp the size of
the syntenic block in A. thaliana and 121 Mbp the size of
the A. thaliana genome (giving 5 × 10-4 for three genes
with an average of 9.2 hits). None of the syntenic A. thaliana genome fragments include a putative or functional
gene for pathogen resistance and only one includes an F-

box containing gene. The A. thaliana gene RPP13 conferring resistance to Peronospora parasitica and having the
highest sequence similarity to the R1 gene family (Additional file 5) is located on chromosome 3 outside any
putatively syntenic region.

Discussion
Genome structure
We found extensive co-linearity of protein-coding genes,
interrupted by unilateral insertions of retrotransposons
and a region of highly diverged DNA sequence in the
vicinity of clusters of tandem duplicated genes. This corresponds to findings in the orthologous genomic region of
hexaploid S. demissum [25]. We show that a 70 kb region
containing ten protein-coding genes is inverted in both
the R1 contig and presumably also the A haplotype of S.
demissum. While sequence similarity at the nucleotide
level was not sufficient to precisely map the inversion
breakpoints in the intergenic regions, order and orientation of homologous gene pairs were consistent without
exception and allowed to estimate the position of the
inversion breakpoints. This inversion is not evident in the
available sequence of the S. demissum A haplotype, as BAC
PGEC472P22 (accession AC151815) mainly contains
genes from the inversion and only few beyond the inversion breakpoint. The gap in the sequence of haplotype A
presumably led to BAC PGEC472P22 being oriented to
achieve co-linearity with B and C haplotypes. Kuang et al.
[25] do not present any data, e.g. mapping of BAC ends or
overlaps with neighboring BAC clones, to verify the orien-

tation. Thus, we take the high sequence similarity, uninterrupted across the presumed inversion break point,
between the R1 contig and PGEC472P22 to indicate that
the inversion also exists in the A haplotype (Additional
files 3 and 4).
Currently, there are only few examples where comparative
structural analysis of orthologous genome segments was
performed in crop plants over several hundred kb. In all
cases reported, micro-structural diversity was found, e.g.
in Zea mays [30,31]. In maize the major contribution to
diversity stems from LTR retrotransposons. In our analysis
transposon related genes are less conserved, also suggesting recent insertions and deletions. In tomato (S. lycopersicum), a segment on chromosome 6 containing the Mi-1
gene for resistance to root knot nematodes, which has
been introgressed from S. peruvianum, was shown to be
inverted in resistant when compared to susceptible
tomato genotypes [32]. The situation at the potato R1
locus described here remarkably resembles this finding.
The R1-contig is part of a genome fragment of unknown
size introgressed from S. demissum into S. tuberosum,
whereas the r1-contig originated either from S. tuberosum
or S. spegazzinii, another closely related tuber bearing Solanum species. P40, the parental donor of the r1 allele, was
an inter-specific hybrid between S. tuberosum and S. spegazzinii [33]. The structural differences between the
homologous chromosomes could interfere with chromosome pairing and crossing-over during meiosis, explaining the low frequency of recombination observed in this
region [22]. Similarly, in regions on tomato chromosome
6 and 11, where the resistance loci Mi and Tm2a, respectively, have been introgressed from the wild species S.
peruvianum, a high degree of recombination suppression
was observed [32,34].
In the R1 contig, the inversion seems to have separated the
R1 resistance gene from a tandem array of R1 homologs
(proteins 22, 23 and 24). We attempted to date the inversion relative to the duplications of tandem resistance
genes by phylogenetic analysis of the protein sequences,
but the results were inconclusive (data not shown). Proteins 23, 24, 44 and 45 clustered together. Proteins 22 and
22/1 also clustered together, and even though gene 22 on
the R1 contig is truncated at the N-terminus relative to 22/
1 and the other R1 homologous proteins, we assume these
to be an orthologous pair. For the other R1 homologues,
allelic relationships are not clear, and they may have
arisen through duplication after the divergence of R1 and
r1.
Kuang et al [25] analyzed the same genomic region on
potato chromosome V between three homeologous chromosomes of the allo-hexaploid potato species S. demissum. Alignment of the sequenced S. demissum BACs with

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/112

the R1- and r1-contig identified haplotypes A and B/C as
most similar but not identical to the R1- and r1-contig,
respectively. Similarity of individual homologous protein
pairs between B and r1 or C and r1 ranges between 90 and
99% identity on the amino acid level, with most, but not
all proteins slightly more similar between C and r1 than
between B and r1. On the other hand, the B haplotype is
structurally more similar to r1, as C shows no tandem
repeated R1 homologous genes but only one single copy.
Remarkable is the discovery of highly conserved and
seemingly rapidly evolving genome regions in close vicinity. The distinguishing feature, aside from the observed
breakdown of nucleotide sequence similarity in non-coding regions and the lack of gene-by-gene co-linearity, is
the presence of tandem repeated genes, namely R1
homologs and F-box containing genes. Such tandem
arrays have been found in other hypervariable genome
regions [35] and may have lead to a greatly enhanced rate
of evolution due to relaxed selection pressure on duplicated genes. Neighboring unique sequences are, in contrast, highly conserved. In the variable region, the R1 and
r1 contigs and the three S. demissum haplotypes show
striking structural variation, ranging from lack of the variable region in S. demissum haplotype C to the expanded
set of F-box proteins found in the R1 contig. The latter are
missing from r1 and B. Instead, in the B haplotype the R1
homologous gene tandem array is more expanded (figure
3).
Encoded proteins
We found a gene density of one gene every 9 kb, which is
similar to previous findings in S. demissum (7.6 kb, [24])
and tomato (8 kb, [36,37]), but lower than A. thaliana (5
kb, [38]) and rice (6 kbp, [39]), and higher than in barley,

where only three genes were found in a stretch of 60 kbp
genomic DNA [40]. The overall GC content was 37% and
39.5% within the putative gene coding regions. These values are comparable to tomato (37% overall GC content
and 42% in coding regions, [36]) and A. thaliana (36%
overall GC content and 44% in coding regions, [38]) but
lower than in rice (44% overall GC content and 54% in
coding regions, [39]) and maize (47% overall GC content
and 55% in coding regions.
The R1 gene family and disease resistance QTL
Annotation of the R1 gene family in S. demissum haplotype A [25] and in the R1-contig was comparable but not
identical. In the R1-contig, six putative full-length R1
homologous genes and no partial homolog were annotated besides the R1 resistance gene itself. The six members of the R1 gene family were organized in two clusters
of three genes each (proteins 22, 23, 24 and 44 = R1, 45,
46). In the corresponding region of S. demissum haplotype
B, four putative full length R1 homologous genes and six
partial homologues were identified. In S. demissum haplotype C, one complete R1 homologue was found [24],
whereas three complete members of the R1 gene family
(proteins 22/1, 52 and 54) were annotated in contig
r1(Figures 1 and 3). Allelic relationships between the R1
homologues could not be deduced with certainty, but
proteins 22 and 22/1 might be allelic based on collinear
positions in the R1- and r1-contig, whereas proteins 44
and 45 might be allelic to 54 and 52 respectively as they
are collinear under the assumption that they are part of
the proposed genomic inversion.

Most of the molecular characterized plant R genes are
members of tightly linked gene families [41]. The R1 gene
family is no exception in this respect. Allelic variants of
the nine identified members of the R1 family or additional paralogous members that are not present in genotype P6/210 are non-exclusive candidates for the
quantitative resistance traits in the resistance hot spot on
potato chromosome V. At this point, we only know that
some of the R1 homologues likely have functions other
than the R1 resistance gene. This is based on the observation that the R1 homologue encoded by ORF 45 was not
capable to complement the R1 race specific resistance
phenotype (A. B. unpublished results).
Genes sequence-related to retrotransposons, ribosomal
genes, RNA dependent RNA polymerase and pseudogenes
are ranked low for being functional candidates for the
quantitative traits in this region of the potato genome. The
remaining 30 putative genes, including hypothetical
genes and genes with unknown function, are all positional candidates for the QTL. Of particular interest as
new candidates for quantitative resistance loci, besides the
members of the R1 gene family, are the members of the F-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/112

box domain family. F-box proteins are involved in various
signaling pathways in A. thaliana, and recently, F-box proteins are suggested to function as receptors for various
plant hormones [42]. Furthermore, an F-box domain was
identified in the SGT1 protein that was shown to play a
role as co-chaperon in the stabilization of R-proteins
[43,44]. With the annotation of the sequenced region, the
list of positional candidate genes for the QTL is certainly
not complete, as the sequence covers only part of the
GP21–GP179 interval. To ultimately validate the role of
any candidate gene for a QTL, complementation analysis
with allelic variants is required. Unless high-throughput
methods for complementation analysis become available,
strategies to reduce the number of candidate genes to be
considered for complementation analysis are necessary.
For example, we perform functional testing by expression
studies and by down-regulation of candidate gene expression by antisense or RNAi approaches [45]. The model
plant A. thaliana may also be used to study the function of
genes that are most closely sequence-related to potato
positional candidate genes. Unfortunately, this approach
may not be applicable to the F-box family, as this is also a
highly expanded gene family in A. thaliana with diverse
cellular roles.
Synteny with A. thaliana
We identified at least five microsyntenic relationships
between the R1 contig and A. thaliana. These cover varying
stretches of the genome, ranging from just four consecutive genes within 7 kb of A. thaliana and 25 kb of potato
to basically the entire R1 contig, covering 405 kb. Frequent insertion-deletion events can be detected. Similar
patterns of interrupted co-linearity on the DNA sequence
level were found among cereals [46] and between A. thaliana and rice [47]. In the highly collinear tomato genome
[2,5], genomic sequences of 57 kbp and 106 kbp on chromosome 2 [48] and 7 [37], respectively, have been compared to the A. thaliana genomic sequence. These studies
revealed syntenic blocks of comparable redundancy and
size with respect to the A. thaliana syntenic regions. In
contrast to these previous studies, the contiguous potato
sequence compared was 4 to 8-times longer. This revealed
that the syntenic potato genes in the R1-contig were
organized in three clusters (ORF 2 to 5, ORF 17 to 19 and
ORF 38 to 48) that were separated by two non-syntenic
regions (ORF 6 to 16 and ORF 20 to 37). In the r1-contig,
a non-syntenic region (ORF 20 to 54) separated two syntenic regions (ORF 17 to 19 and ORF 38 to 43).

The most notable of the syntenic relationships spans
almost the complete R1 contig (405 kbp) and 54 kbp of
A. thaliana chromosome 1. Seven genes are conserved in
sequence, order and orientation, except for two from
region E that show reverse order and orientation compared to A. thaliana. This could indicate that the genomic

inversion occurred in the R1 lineage after the divergence
of A. thaliana and potato, with r1 and S. demissum B and C
haplotypes showing the ancestral orientation. In the R1
contig, a large number (18) of genes do not show synteny,
whereas in the A. thaliana region this only applies to five
genes. The discrepancy is less pronounced if the 17 tandemly duplicated genes in potato are ignored.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/112

and three as transcription factors. Comparing potato to
Arabidopsis thaliana annotated proteins revealed five
micro-syntenic blocks of three to seven ORFs with A. thaliana chromosomes 1, 3 and 5, suggesting fragmented
structural conservation between these distantly related
plant species.

Methods
The non-syntenic regions correspond to the highly divergent regions between R1 and r1 and included all but one
(ORF 40) transposon sequences, all F-box-containing
genes and six of the ten resistance-gene-homologues. The
annotation of the A. thaliana syntenic regions identified,
besides the sequence related ORFs, some transposon
sequences but only one F-box-containing gene and no
resistance gene homolog. Moreover, the non-syntenic
regions in the R1- and r1-contigs coincided with regions II
and IV in S. demissum, which showed the highest divergence between the homeologous chromosome segments
A, B and C [25]. This suggests that the genome of potato
and related species in the sequenced region consists of a
patchwork of faster and more slowly evolving segments.
The sequenced potato genomic segment covers a genetic
distance of only 0.1 Centimorgan. At a hundred times
larger scale, when genome-wide genetic maps of potato,
sunflower, sugar beet and Prunus were compared to the A.
thaliana physical map (macrosynteny), syntenic blocks
from 1 to 20 Centimorgans were identified. A common
fraction of the genomes of these distantly related plant
species appear to have been conserved throughout the
evolution of the dicots, when compared to the rest of the
genome [49]. The GP21–GP179 interval was not part of a
macrosyntenic block between potato and A. thaliana [4].

Conclusion
Two contiguous sequences of 417,445 and 202,781 base
pairs were assembled and annotated for a region on
potato chromosome V, which contains genes controling
several agronomic traits. Comparative sequence analysis
revealed highly conserved collinear regions that flank
regions showing high variability and tandem duplicated
genes. The co-linearity between the homologous chromosomes was disrupted by non-allelic insertions of retrotransposon elements, stretches of diverged intergenic
sequences, differences in gene content and gene order.
The latter was mainly caused by inversion of a 70 kbp
genomic fragment.
Annotation of the genomic sequence identified 48 putative open reading frames (ORF) in one contig and 22 in
the other, with an average of one ORF every 9 kbp. The
majority of the ORFs were members of multiple gene families. Ten ORFs were classified as resistance-gene-like, 11
as F-box-containing genes, 13 as transposable elements

BAC-libraries
For contig construction, two BAC genomic libraries were
used, each consisting of ca. 100 000 clones (two hundred
and sixty four 384-well microtiter plates). Both libraries
were generated from high molecular weight DNA of the
diploid, heterozygous potato clone P6/210, a F1 hybrid of
the parental clones P41 (H79.1506/1) and P40
(H80.696/4) [9]. The 'BA' library has been described [22].
The library 'BC' was constructed in the cloning vector
pBeloBAC11 [50] from partially EcoRI digested genomic
DNA. The procedures for the construction of recombinant
BAC clones, clone picking and storing were as described
previously [22,51]. The average insertion size of the 'BC'
library was 80 kbp, corresponding to an, on average, 8fold coverage of the potato genome.
BAC plasmid DNA isolation
A single colony was pre-cultured in 250 μl LB medium
including 12.5 mg/l tetracycline for clones from the "BA"
library and 12.5 mg/l chloramphenicol for clones from
the "BC" library. The pre-culture was used to inoculate 50
ml LB medium containing the corresponding antibiotic.
Plasmid DNA was isolated from 50 ml overnight culture
using the QIAGEN Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
BAC-library screening
High-density colony filters of the libraries were prepared
and screened by colony-hybridization as described [22].
The 'BC' library was also screened by the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) after isolating plasmid DNA from bacterial
cells pooled at three levels: mini-pools, maxi-pools and
super-pools. One thousand fifty six mini-pools were made
from 96 clones each, 264 maxi-pools were prepared from
384 clones each (four mini-pools) and the 88 super-pools
consisted of 1152 clones each (three maxi-pools). To
identify a single positive clone, four rounds of PCR screening were performed. First, the DNA of the 88 super-pools
was used as template. Second, the three maxi-pools constituting a positive super-pool were screened. Third, the
four mini-pools of a positive maxi-pool were amplified
and last, the 96 clones of the positive mini-pool were
screened individually.
Physical mapping
Overlapping BACs were identified and ordered in two
contigs corresponding to the two homologous chromo-

somes of genotype P6/210 as described previously [22]. In
short, BAC insertion ends were sequenced using T3 and T7
oligonucleotides as sequencing primers. The end
sequences were used to detect overlaps, either based on
100% sequence identity with already sequenced BACs or
by generating amplicons with identical sequences in different BACs. BAC contigs were assigned to either one or
the other homologous chromosome by identifying DNA
polymorphisms in insertion end sequences that were specific either for the allele inherited from parent P41 or parent P40.
Genomic DNA Sequencing and Assembly
Whole BAC clones were sequenced by the shotgun
sequencing strategy. Custom sub-libraries of the BACs
were prepared by GATC-Biotech AG (Konstanz, Germany). After physical fractionation of the BAC DNA, the
random sheared fragments were blunt-ended by using T4
DNA-Polymerase and then ligated into the pCR4BluntTOPO vector (Invitrogen, California, USA). Approximately 1300 clones containing ca. 1.5 kbp insertions and
300 to 400 clones with 4 to 5 kbp insertions were produced for each BAC. The smaller inserts were amplified by
colony-PCR using as primers TO2f (5'-agcggataacaatttcacacagga-3') and TO2r (5'-gacgttgtaaaacgacggccagtg-3').
The PCR was performed in a volume of 100 μl containing
10 pmol of each primer, 0.2 mM dNTPs and 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.2 Units of Taq-Polymerase and the corresponding buffer from Invitrogen, California, USA. PCR conditions were: initial denaturation at 96°C for 5 min
followed by 34 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 50 sec,
annealing at 55°C for 50 sec and extension at 72°C for 3
min and a final extension for 4 min at 72°C. Plasmid
DNA was purified from the clones having 5 kb inserts
using the BioRobot 9600 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
PCR products and plasmids were sequenced using T3 and
T7 primers (Amersham, Pharmacia GE Healthcare BioSciences: Little Chalfont, UK). Sequencing reactions were
performed by using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator
Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit and an ABI377 automated DNA Sequencer (PE Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA). The approximately ten-fold redundant
sequences were assembled using the PreGAP4 and GAP4
from Staden software package (Medical Research Council
Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK). The
Lasergene software package (DNAstar, Madison, WI, USA)
was used for sequence assemblies, comparisons and alignments. The sequences of overlapping BAC insertions were
assembled after trimming any vector sequences using the
SeqMan module of Lasergene and the Megamerger program, which is part of the EMBOSS package [52].
Sequence analysis
Dotter and MUMer [54] were used to align and compare
genomic sequences. Putative exons and open reading

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/112

frames (ORFs) were predicted by the programs GenMark.hmm [54], FGeneSH [55] and by alignment of EST
(Expressed Sequence Tags) and protein sequences using
GenomeThreader [56]. Genes were annotated by combining predicted ORFs from these gene finder programs with
alignments of homologous sequences in public databases
using the Apollo Genome Annotation Curation Tool [57]
(Additional files 1 and 2). All genes were also manually
annotated for putative function. Functional descriptions
of homologous genes in the SWISSPROT database [58]
were compared with homologous protein domains and
patterns in the InterPro database [59]. Homologous genes
in the SWISSPROT database were identified using BlastP
[60] and homologous protein domains and patterns were
identified by InterProScan [61]. Inparanoid [62] and
BlastX [60] were used for the identification of similar
genes in A. thaliana. The deduced amino acid sequences of
the annotated ORFs were compared to A. thaliana annotated proteins from The A. thaliana Information Resource
(TAIR) Release 6 [64]. The threshold criterion for accepting sequence similarity as significant was an E-value < 1010 for BLASTP searches. Polyproteins and transposable elements were excluded from the comparison because of
their limited information value. For the same reason,
ORFs with more than 30 hits in the A. thaliana genome
were also excluded [4]. A two-dimensional array was generated with the potato physical map of 420,000 bp in one
dimension and the A. thaliana physical map of 121 mb in
the other [4]. Hits of the putative potato proteins with A.
thaliana annotated proteins were positioned in the array
according to their base pair coordinates on the local
potato and genome wide A. thaliana physical maps. Syntenic blocks were identified based on the criterion that at
least three different ORFs within the potato contigs found
hits within an A. thaliana genome fragment of similar size.

these in haplotype A to be around 50 kb in size, covered by the unsequenced BAC PGEC597C19 according to Kuang et al. Only local and
limited similarity and co-linearity is observed between the R1-contig and
BACs from the B and C haplotypes. The colour reflects percent sequence
similarity, with red denoting close to 100% similarity.

Figure S4: Dot-Plot comparison computed by MUMmer of the DNA
sequence of the r1-contig and BAC sequences of S. demissum. One column represents one BAC sequence of S. demissum. The first three columns (from left to right) are BAC sequences from haplotype A, the next
seven from haplotype B and the last two columns from haplotype C. The
figure shows two regions of high similarity and co-linearity between the
r1-contig and haplotype B and C of S. demissum, with similar but
weaker similarity to haplotype A sequences. The first comprises the region
between the beginning and 60 kb of the r1-contig and the second runs
from 160 kb till the end of the r1-contig. The middle region shows some
local similarity that is interrupted by non-conserved sequence. Most of the
more significant similarities in this area reflect tandemly duplicated Rgenes. The BAC sequences from haplotype C do not contain this region,
indicating a deletion in haplotype C as found by Huang et al. An inverted
repeat of a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase leads to an X-shaped structure in the plot of the first 40 kb of the r1-contig against the S. demissum
sequences, similar to the findings in Figure 2 when comparing to the R1contig (region B). The colour reflects percent sequence similarity, with red
denoting close to 100% similarity.
