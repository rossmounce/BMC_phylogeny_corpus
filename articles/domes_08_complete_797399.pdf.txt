Abstract
Background: Complete mitochondrial (mt) genomes and the gene rearrangements therein are
increasingly used as molecular markers for investigating phylogenetic relationships, especially for
elucidating deep splits. Contributing to the complete mt genomes of arthropods, especially
Arachnida, available so far, we provide the first complete mt genome of a sarcoptiform mite
species, the sexually reproducing oribatid mite Steganacarus magnus (Acari, Oribatida) which was
determined by sequencing of long PCR products.
Results: The mt genome of S. magnus lacks 16 tRNAs, only those for leucine, histidine, proline,
tryptophan, glutamine and serine are present. Within those tRNAs only tRNA-His and tRNA-Pro
have kept their original position, the others are translocated. Furthermore, the mt genome of S.
magnus consists of 13,818 bp and it is composed of 13 protein-coding genes and two genes for the
ribosomal RNA subunits that are typically found in metazoan mt genomes. The gene order in S.
magnus differs from the hypothetical ancestral chelicerate arrangement as conserved in Limulus
polyphemus: instead of nad1-rrnL-rrnS-LNR-nad2 (tRNAs excluded) S. magnus is nad2-rrnL-nad1-rrnSLNR. Phylogenetic analyses of a concatenated amino acid dataset of all mt protein-coding genes of
28 arthropod species suggest a sister-group relationship of sarcoptiform and prostigmatid mites (S.
magnus and Leptotrombidium).
Conclusion: The mt gene arrangement of S. magnus differs from the hypothetical ground plan of
arthropods and from that of other mites further contributing to the variety of mt gene
arrangements found in Arachnida. The unexpected lack of tRNAs is enigmatic, probably showing
that the loss of mt genes is an ongoing evolutionary process. For solving phylogenetic relationships
of oribatid mite lineages and their position within Acari further complete mt genomes are needed.

Background
Mitochondria are maternally inherited cell organelles that
contain a circular genome of about 14–19 kb in bilaterian
animals; the mitochondrial (mt) DNA in metazoans usually codes for 13 proteins, 22 transfer RNAs (tRNA), two

ribosomal RNAs (rRNA; large (rrnL) and small (rrnS)
ribosomal subunit) and contains a non-coding control
region (LNR) of variable length [1,2]. The loss of genes in
mitochondria is a commonly recognized and ongoing
process in eukaryotes [3]. Eukaryotic mt genomes generPage 1 of 13

ally contain fewer genes than their free-living bacterial
ancestors since the majority of the original mt proteins are
now encoded in the nucleus; this is either caused by the
transfer of the original mt gene to the nucleus or by the
replacement of its function by a preexisting nuclear gene
[4]. The protein-coding genes which have been retained in
mt genomes are mainly those involved in electron transport and phosphorylation, e.g., cytochrome b (cob) and
the cytochrome oxidases (cox1, cox2, cox3) [4], but their
number is variable ranging from three in the malaria parasite Plasmodium falsciparum (Apicomplexa) [5] to 67 in
Reclinomonas americana, the earliest branching aerobic
protist (Chlorophyta) [6].
In addition to gene loss, the positions of genes relative to
each other exhibit frequent rearrangement. While the
arrangement of mt genes is conserved in some lineages of
arthropods [7,8], it is highly variable in others [9-11]. In
particular, the positions of the relatively small genes for
tRNAs frequently vary within and among taxa. The
arrangement of the hypothetical ancestor of arthropods is
conserved in the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus [12],
whereas most insect genomes differ from the ancestral
state by the location of one tRNA [7].
Oribatid mites (Acari, Oribatida) are soil-dwelling animals that occur in high numbers in almost all terrestrial
ecosystems [13]. A characteristic feature of this group is
the unusually high percentage of parthenogenetic taxa
(~10% of all species) and the co-occurrence of sexuality
and parthenogenesis in the same habitat [14]. Oribatid
mite fossils date back at least 360 million years [15,16]
and therefore a number of parthenogenetic lineages of
oribatid mites join bdelloid rotifers as "ancient asexual
scandals" [17-20]. Since oribatid mites provide insights
into the evolution and maintenance of sex, recently much
attention has been paid to their phylogeny and radiation
[21-24]. However, studies based on single genes such as
the ribosomal 18S region (18S), the heat shock protein 82
(hsp82), the elongation factor 1α (ef1α) or cox1 could neither satisfactorily resolve phylogenetic relationships [25]
nor clarify the number of parthenogenetic radiations [21]
nor delineate the age of the group [20]. Since oribatid
mites apparently are among the first terrestrial animals (I.
Schaefer, R.A. Norton, S. Scheu & M. Maraun, unpubl.
data) and species exhibit different evolutionary mutation
rates, lineages are probably vulnerable to long-branch
attraction in phylogenetic reconstruction. Therefore, further markers, such as gene rearrangements in mt genomes,
are needed to resolve phylogenetic relationships of oribatid mite lineages, among mite taxa (Acari) and among
chelicerates in general.
Until now no complete mt genome of an oribatid mite
species was available although mitochondrial genomes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/532

have become invaluable phylogenetic markers during the
last few years. Complete mt genome sequences are now
known for about 150 arthropods, including 26 chelicerates with 15 species of Acari. These 15 acarine genomes
represent ten species of ticks (Ixodida, Parasitiformes),
two mesostigmate mites (Mesostigmata, Parasitiformes)
and three species of the genus Leptotrombidium (Prostigmata, Acariformes). In contrast to other arthropods and
Metazoa in general [2], the arrangement of the mt genes
differs markedly within and among taxa of Acari. While
the ancestral state of arthropods is retained in soft- and
prostriate-hard ticks [8,26], there is a major rearrangement shared by all metastriate hard ticks [26,27], and
there are numerous, lineage specific rearrangements in the
mesostigmate species, such as Varroa destructor [28] and
Metaseiulus occidentalis [29], and also in the prostigmate
mite genus Leptotrombidium [10]. Since the deep phylogeny of Acari, especially within the large subgroup of Acariformes,
is
still
controversial,
synapomorphic
rearrangements of mt genes, if present, would likely allow
new insights into phylogenetic relationships.
We report the first mt genome for an oribatid mite, Steganacarus magnus (Nicolet, 1855). The mt genome of S. magnus is compared with that of other mites and with basal
chelicerates to clarify phylogenetic relationships within
Acari and Chelicerata in total. We show that the mt
genome of S. magnus is slightly rearranged and lacks 16
tRNA genes.

Results and discussion
Mitochondrial genome organization
The mt genome of S. magnus is the first genome published
for the large mite group of Sarcoptiformes. The complete
mt genome is circular and consists of 13,818 bp [GenBank: EU935607]. It encodes 13 protein-coding genes,
two rRNA genes, six tRNA genes and includes a large noncoding control region as well as several size-variable intergene spacer regions (Fig. 1, Additional File 1). Genes are
encoded on both strands which is typical for arthropods.
Compared to the mt arrangement of the ancestral arthropod, which is conserved in Limulus polyphemus [12], the
genome of S. magnus is slightly rearranged: instead of
nad1-rrnL-rrnS-LNR-nad2 (tRNAs excluded, underlined
genes are coded on the minority strand) the gene arrangement is nad2-rrnL-nad1-rrnS-LNR (Fig. 1); all translocated
genes have kept their original orientation. Furthermore,
the genes for tRNA-Leu, -Trp, -Gln and -Ser are translocated to new positions with tRNA-Ser, -Leu, and -Trp also
being inverted relative to the ground plan; only tRNA-His
and -Pro remained in their original location.

Rearrangements of genes in mt genomes are useful markers for deep splits within phylogenies [2] although the relative frequency of rearrangements varies among lineages

[30]. For example, Drosophila (Insecta) and Daphnia
(Crustacea) share the same mt rearrangement although
they diverged 400–500 million years ago [30] and the mt
genome of soft ticks remained unchanged for a similar
time period [8]. In contrast, gene arrangements in mt
genomes of lice are highly variable [9,11], and in the mite
genus Leptotrombidium they even differ between species
[10]. In general, in mt genomes of Acari a number of rearrangements have occurred. While the ground plan is
retained in soft- and prostriate-hard ticks [26], the
arrangement of mt genes in Mesostigmata (Parasitiformes), especially Metaseiulus occidentalis is strongly
derived. Notably, the Metaseiulus mt genome is the largest
within chelicerates, even though nad3 and nad6 were lost,
due to the duplication of many of the remaining genes
[29].
Fossils of oribatid mites are known from Devonian sediments and molecular studies suggest that their origin may
predate this record by ~180 mya (I. Schaefer, R.A. Norton,
S. Scheu & M. Maraun, unpubl. data). Further, oribatids

probably diverged from other acariform mites, such as
Leptotrombidium, about 570 mya ago (I. Schaefer, R.A.
Norton, S. Scheu & M. Maraun, unpubl. data). The mt
genomes of Leptotrombidium and S. magnus differ markedly; they only share the gene boundaries cox1-cox2, nad6cob and atp8-atp6-cox3 (Fig. 1). However, since these
boundaries are also present in the ground plan of chelicerate mt genomes there are no derived arrangements supporting the common ancestry of Acariformes.
Protein-coding genes and nucleotide composition
All 13 protein-coding genes typically present in arthropods could be identified in the mt genome of S. magnus.
They start with the mt start codons ATT, ATG, ATA and
ATC (Additional File 1). Six genes (cox1, atp6, nad3, nad5,
cob, nad2) terminate with incomplete stop codons (T or
TA; Additional File 1) while all others terminate with
either TAA, TAG or TTT (atp8, cox3, nad4, nad4L, nad6,
nad1; Additional File 1). In cox2, which is flanked by two
other protein-coding genes (cox1 and atp8), no stop
codon is present; as shown for sets of protein-coding

genes in Anabrus simplex (Orthoptera, Insecta) a stem-loop
formation in the secondary structure of the transcribed
polycistronic mRNA probably functions as terminator
[31].
The percentage nucleotide composition of the mt (+)strand is A = 36.5, C = 13.2, G = 12.2 and T = 38.1. Therefore, there are approximately equal numbers of each complementary nucleotide pairs (A:T, G:C) but a strong ATbias is present. The pattern for all protein-coding genes is
also strongly AT-biased but with a much higher T than A
content (Additional File 1). Skews calculated for neutral
fourfold degenerate sites do not indicate consistent asymmetric strand bias (Additional File 1). Genes encoded on
the (+)-strand show either neutral (atp6, nad2), positive
(cox2, nad6) or negative CG-skew (cox1, cox3, nad3, cob).
The majority of genes encoded on the (-)-strand are positive CG-skewed (nad5, nad4L, nad1) (Additional File 1).
The AT skew at fourfold degenerate sites is only positive
for nad2 and nad5, but negative for all other protein-coding genes (Additional File 1).
A reversal of the strand bias is usually explained by an
inversion of the control region (LNR) which contains the
origin of replication and translation [2,32]. During replication the two different strands ((-)- and (+)-strand) are
exposed to different mutational pressures, typically causing distinct skews since one strand remains longer in the
single-stranded state than the other [33]. Therefore, the
LNR likely functions as a key region for determining
strand bias and an inversion results in a complete reversal
of the strand nucleotide composition over time [33]. In S.
magnus most genes encoded on the (+)-strand show a negative CG-skew at fourfold degenerate third codon positions which is inverted to the common pattern and
probably indicates a reversal of the LNR. On the other
hand, the presence of neutral or positive skewed genes
may indicate that this reversal is of recent origin and consequently the process of inverting nucleotide skew is not
completed so far.
The absence of a distinct strand bias can also be explained
by the recent inversion of single genes which homogenize
general patterns of asymmetry [33,34]. However, since no
inversions of protein-coding genes were found in S. magnus, the absence of a distinct asymmetrical skew in the
genome awaits explanation.
Putative control region
The major non-coding region (LNR), which presumably
functions as the mitochondrial control region, is 1019 bp
in length and located between rrnS and cox1 (Fig. 1).
There are additional non-coding intergenic regions ranging in size from 2–127 bp. These regions were blasted and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/532

checked for tRNA genes but could not be assigned to any
functional gene.
The relative location of the LNR varies greatly among
invertebrates with the ancestral pattern of arthropods
being rrnS-LNR-tRNA-Ile [1,2]. It also varies in length
mostly due to different numbers of sequence repeats, and
length heteroplasmy within individuals has also been
recorded [32]. There was no length heteroplasmy in S.
magnus but two inverted sequence repeat regions, each
with a length of 190 bp, were present at positions 133–
322 (repeat 1) and 830–1019 (repeat 2). The region
before repeat 1 contains four stem-loop structures at positions 3–26, 32–56, 60–76 and 82–129 (Fig. 2); the region
between the two repeats contains 10–12 stem-loop structures depending on differences in folding. None of the
hairpin structures is associated with a poly-A or poly-T
stretch which would mark the origin of replication (OR)
in insect mt genomes [32] nor with a TATA- or GA(A)Tmotif as present in other arthropods [26]. Since the OR
typically is close to the gene of rrnS and repeat regions are
posterior to it [32], we assume the first region to be the OR
of the mt genome of S. magnus.
In the mesostigmate mite M. occidentalis the stem-loop
structure which probably represents the OR comprises
only AT nucleotides but does not have any similarity to
sequences from other chelicerates [29]. The LNR of the
mite V. destructor includes several repetitions of a 157-bp
motif and eleven sites of potential stem-loop structures
have been identified close to it [28]. In the genus Leptotrombidium, the closest relative to S. magnus for which an
mt genome is sequenced, the LNR is duplicated (and one
is inverted) in L. akamushi and L. deliense and four copies
are present in L. pallidum [10,27]. Although mt LNR possess several distinct structural features (e.g., high AT-content, concerted evolution of tandem repeats, stem-loop
structures), their use for evolutionary studies is limited by
the high variability of the sequence and the possibility of
length heteroplasmy within individuals [32].
rRNA genes
The large subunit of the rRNA (rrnL) is 992 bp in length
(Additional File 1) which is a bit shorter than in other
mite species (e.g., about 1,014 bp in Leptotrombidium [10],
1,212 bp in Carios capensis [8]). The 5'-end starts three
nucleotides apart from nad1 (encoded on the (-)-strand).
The 3'-end was difficult to assign since parts of the last
stem-loop structure can be included in the gene for tRNASer (Fig. 3A). The gene for the small subunit (rrnS) is 609
bp in length and located between nad1 and the control
region (Additional File 1, Fig. 3B). Both ribosomal subunits have a similar AT content to the protein-coding genes
and both are encoded on the (-)-strand as in most species
of arthropods and chelicerates (e.g., Limulus, Araneae,

Ricinulei, Pycnogonida, Scorpiones and Ixodidae)
[12,26,35-37]. In contrast, in the mt genome of the closely
related genus Leptotrombidum as well as in M. occidentalis
both ribosomal RNA genes are encoded on the (+)-strand
(but L. pallidum has a duplicated rrnL gene on the (-)strand) [10,27,29].
The secondary structures of the rRNA genes in Steganacarus differ from those published for Leptotrombidium [10]
but are more similar to those published for insects [e.g.,
[38,39]]. The Leptotrombium rrnS gene lacks helices 1, 2, 4,
5, 7, 8 and 22, and the compound helices 19–20–21 and
39–40–42 as depicted have a very different secondary
structure from that found in other arthropods [10]. In
contrast, most of the helices found in arthropod rrnS
genes are present in Steganacarus, but helices 7 and 8 are
absent. However, helix 5 has a large loop such that there
is limited difference in sequence length in this region
between Steganacarus and arthropods which possess these
helices; this is similar to the structure found in Hymenoptera [38]. Helix 16 is greatly shortened relative to other
species, consisting of just 2 paired bases compared to up
to 8 in Leptotrombidium [10]. The loop regions between
helices 38 and 39–40–42 are also greatly reduced consisting of just 4 bp on the 5' side and 2 bp on the 3'; this is in
contrast to insects where these loops consist of a dozen or
more bases on each side.
Similarly, the rrnL gene of Leptotrombidium entirely lacks
domain I (helices B12, B20), helices C1, cd1, D1 and H3
and the structure of the compound helices D17-D18-D19
is unique to Leptotrombidium. The Steganacarus rrnL secondary structure is again more similar to that of other
arthropods, domain I is absent but helices C1, cd1 and D1
are present and D17-D18-D19 has a more canonical structure. Helix G3 is greatly reduced, consisting of just 2
paired stem bases and 3 loop bases, relative to both Leptotrombidium, 6 stem and 3 loop bases, and insects, up to
20 stem and 22 loop bases in Manduca [39]. The 3' end of
the rrnL molecule is ambiguous, bases 10346–10290
either form the tRNA gene for Serine or they form helices
H3 and the 3' side of H2. Without an analysis of the
mature transcribed genes it is not possible to determine
which form is more likely in the mature molecule. Helix
H3 is not present in all arthropod rrnL genes found in
Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera but is absent from Coleoptera and Leptotrombidium and its function in the mature
rRNA is unclear. Accordingly, we present both possibilities, helices H2 and H3 are included in Figure 3 with the
region which potentially forms the tRNA shown in a box,
while tRNA-Ser is included in Figure 1 and Additional File
1.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/532

tRNA genes
Out of the 22 tRNA genes typically present in arthopods
only six are present in S. magnus. Out of these six tRNAs,
only two have kept their original position (tRNA-His
between nad5 and nad4, tRNA-Pro between nad4L and
nad6 with tRNA-Thr missing) while all others are translocated relative to the ground plan. Further, tRNA-Leu overlaps the nad5 gene by four nucleotides and tRNA-Trp
overlaps with the 3'-end of cob by 16 nucleotides (Additional File 1); as described above tRNA-Ser presumably
forms part of the rrnL gene at the 3'-end (Fig. 3A). Remarkably, although 16 tRNA genes have been lost, the mt
genome size of S. magnus (13,818) is comparable to those
of Leptotrombidium deliense (13,731) and L. akamushi
(13,698) [10,27] which is due to a larger LNR and more
intergenic spacer regions.

All present tRNAs differ remarkably from the typical cloverleaf structure: in tRNA-Leu and -Ser the D-stem and loop are missing and the TψC-stem is short with only two
complementary base pairs (Fig. 4). In contrast, the
homologous tRNA for leucine in L. pallidum and M. occidentalis lacks the TψC- instead of the D-arm [27,29]; while
the structure of tRNA-Ser in L. pallidum is similar to that of
S. magnus, it differs in M. occidentalis which lacks the TψCarm.
The tRNAs for histidine, proline, tryptophan and
glutamine lack the TψC-stem and -loop but posses a complete DHU-stem with a smaller loop in tRNA-Trp and a
larger in tRNA-Gln (Fig. 4); this lack of the TψC-arm is
also present in L. pallidum [27] and M. occidentalis [29].
All tRNAs present in S. magnus are shorter than the average
length of arthropod tRNAs (about 66 bp) and are highly
modified. The loss of the TψC-arm and the replacement
by a size-variable loop was first recognized in nematode
tRNAs [40] and can also be found in M. occidentalis [29],
L. pallidum [10] and other chelicerates including scorpions
[35] and spiders [41]. Further, a study on truncated tRNAs
in Arachnida revealed that the tRNAs for proline, histidine
and glutamine have experienced the greatest number of
independent TψC-arm losses in arachnids whereas TψCarm loss in genes for arginine, lysine and methione have
occurred only once and is synapomorphic for
opisthothele spiders [42]. However, arachnids seem to
have a compensatory mechanism that allows truncated
tRNAs to function during translation and the interaction
with the ribosome [42].
While the two rRNA genes are present in all eukaryotic
genomes [4], the number of tRNA genes varies markedly
among taxa. No tRNAs are present in the protists Plasmodium falciparum (Apicomplexa) and Trypanosoma brucei
(Kinetoplastida) [43] but up to 27 are present in Reclino-

monas americana (Chlorophyta) [6]. The loss of mt tRNA
genes may be facilitated by the fact that the proteins with
which they interact during translation in the mitochondria are encoded in the nucleus [44]. Furthermore, the
mutation rate of mt encoded tRNA genes is about five-fold
higher than that of nuclear genes which experience strong
purifying selection [45,46]. Since tRNAs are encoded in
the nucleus anyway and selective pressure favors the
reduction of mt genome size [4], it is likely that S. magnus
simply lost its tRNA genes instead of transferring them to
the nucleus. However, the differences in the genetic code
between nucleus (universal code) and mitochondria
(invertebrate mt code) would probably argue for two sets
of tRNAs or alternatively some modifications of the tRNAamino acyl transferases are needed to treat each tRNA isotype differently in the two different compartments.
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic analyses performed on a concatenated dataset of all protein-coding genes (amino acid sequences)
included three outgroup species (Daphnia pulex (Crustacea), Penaeus monodon (Crustacea), Lithobius forficatus
(Myriapoda)), one species of Solifugae, Xiphosura, and
Ricinulei, two Scorpiones species, four species of Araneae
and Acariformes and twelve species of Parasitiformes (Fig.
5). All major groups, notably Parasitiformes, Acariformes,
Araneae and Scorpiones, were monophyletic and supported by moderate (Araneae) to high (Acariformes, Scorpiones) support values. The sister-group relationship of
Scorpiones and Araneae was only supported by posterior
probablities (Fig. 5).

The newly sequenced S. magnus formed the closest relative
of the prostigmate mite genus Leptotrombidium which was
expected following previous studies [13]. As in previous
studies [36] the ricinuleid species Pseudocellus pearsei clustered as sister-group of Acariformes but was only supported by Bayesian posterior probabilities (Fig. 5). In
contrast to the study of Fahrein et al. [36] the Acariformes/
Ricinulei clade did not form the sister-group of Araneae
but of Parasitiformes; however, the support for both possibilities is similar weak [see [36]].
For a broader investigation of chelicerate phylogeny mt
DNA data of key taxa such as Opiliones, Pseudoscorpiones, Palpigradi, Uropygi and Amblypygi are missing.
Even for a complete study of Acari phylogeny many taxa
remain to be sampled; no complete mt genome is available for Astigmata, Endeostigmata or Opilioacarida.
While using mt DNA for phylogenetic studies, a reversal of
nucleotide strand bias or a reversal of nucleotide bias of
single genes (caused by gene inversion or the inversion of
the control region) can be misleading for phylogenetic
relationships by causing long-branch attraction artifacts

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/532

[34]. Further, since mt genomes evolve at higher rates
than the nuclear genome [47], saturation of the phylogenetic signal can also be problematic in deep split phylogenies. Species exhibiting unusual genomic features such as
complicated gene arrangements or multiple control
regions as well as species with small body sizes or parasitic
lifestyle are also vulnerable to long branches [34]. Collectively, Acari exhibit all these features and so a heavy sampling effort will be necessary to reliably use mt genomics
in mite phylogenetic studies.

Conclusion
The first complete mt genome for an oribatid mite (S.
magnus, Oribatida, Acariformes) is a typical circular molecule and comprises all protein-coding genes typically
present in Metazoa and two genes for the ribosomal subunits. Compared to the putative ground pattern of arthropods the genome is rearranged, affecting the genes nad1,
rrnL, rrnS, and nad3. Further, the genome of S. magnus
lacks all but six tRNAs, but is comparable in size with
genomes of the closely related genus Leptotrobidium; the
close relationship of both of these acariform mites was
confirmed by phylogenetic analyses using all mt proteincoding genes. Since mt gene arrangements vary strongly
among mite species and no full mt genomes are available
for Astigmata, Endeostigmata and Opilioacarida, the use
of mtDNA rearrangements for phylogenetic studies is limited at present, especially since gene rearrangements in the
studied Acari species do not show a distinct phylogenetic
pattern. However, the growing number of published
genomes and the better understanding of rearranging
mechanisms make mt genomes promising markers for
resolving phylogenetic relationships of acarine lineages
and Chelicerata in general.

Methods
DNA processing
Specimens of S. magnus were collected from the Kranichstein forest located about 8 km northeast of Darmstadt,
Germany. Animals were extracted from leaf litter by heat
using a modified Kempson extractor [48], preserved in
75% ethanol and stored at -20°C until usage. Total DNA
was extracted from single specimens using the DNeasy
Tissue kit (Qiagen) following the manufactures' protocol
(but final elution of DNA was in 40 μl instead of 200 μl).
Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed for the
small ribosomal subunit (rrnS), the cytochrome b (cob)
and cytochrome oxidase I (cox1) genes using the primers
12SA and 12SB, CB3 and CB4 and COIarch1 and
COIarch2, respectively (Additional File 2). PCR reaction
mixtures contained 12.5 μl HotStarTaq MasterMix (Qiagen), 0.7 μl of each primer (100 pmol/μl), and 4 μl DNA
(unquantified) in a total volume of 25 μl. Amplification
conditions included an initial activation step at 95°C for
15 min followed by 34 cycles of 95°C for 45 s; 44°C

(rrnS), 50°C (cob) or 51°C (cox1) for 1 min; 72°C for 55
s and a final elongation at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products
were visualized on a 1% agarose gel, purified using the
QIAquickPCR Purification kit (Qiagen) and directly
sequenced by Macrogen (South Korea).
Long PCR amplifications were performed using 1 μl Elongase (Invitrogen), 1 μl buffer A, 4 μl buffer B, 2.5 μl dNTPs
(25 mM), 1 μl of each primer (10 mM) and 1–2 μl of DNA
(unquantified) with the following conditions: 92°C for 2
min; 40 cycles of 92°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s, 68°C for
12 min and a final extension step of 68°C for 20 min. Initial primers for long PCR were designed from the previously obtained sequences of rrnS, cob and cox1
(Additional File 2). PCR products were visualized on 1%
agarose gels and purified using Millipore Montage vacuum purification plates. Sequencing was performed using
ABI BigDye 3.1 dye terminator technology with an ABI
capillary sequencer at the John Curtin Medical School
sequencing centre (Australian National University). Cycle
sequencing reactions contained 1 μl BigDye, 0.5 μl of the
primer (25 mM) and 0.5–1.0 μl template (in a total volume of 3 μl) and amplification conditions were 28 cycles
of 94°C for 10 s, 50°C for 5 s and 60°C for 4 min. Within
each long PCR product the complete double-stranded
sequence was determined by primer walking (a list of all
primers is available from the corresponding author upon
request). Since PCR amplifications derived from DNA
extracted from different specimens the final genome
sequence is a consensus from a pool of individuals.

present but unannotated in the Steganacarus mt genome
they cannot be identified at this time.
Candidate rRNA genes were identified by blastn searches
and aligned with homologous rRNA genes from other
chelicerates and insects. A secondary structure model for
each gene was elucidated by comparison to the published
rRNA secondary structures for Apis [38], Manduca [39] and
Leptotrombidium [10].
For phylogenetic analyses we used the concatenated
amino acid dataset of all protein-coding genes previously
used by Fahrein et al. [36]; amino acid sequences were
choosen since a more conservative and more unambiguous alignment was possible. Sequences were aligned using
the default settings in ClustalX 1.81 [52]; the gene order
was adapted from Fahrein et al. [36]. Since most parts of
the aligned amino acid sequences were unambiguous all
parts were included in tree construction. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis was performed with MrBayes v3.1.2 [53]
using the mitochondrial genetic code for Metazoa and a
haploid ploidy level with two independent runs of
1,000,000 generations and four chains each; trees were
sampled every 500 generations. A majority consensus tree
was generated using a burn-in of 200. Phylogenetic trees
were also constructed using neighbour-joining (NJ) based
on uncorrected p-distances as implemented in PAUP*
4b10 [54]. Reliability of the branches was ascertained by
bootstrap analyses with 10,000 replicates.

Authors' contributions
Analysis and annotation
Data were assembled into contigs using Sequencher™ version 4.7 (Gene Codes Corperation 2006). Protein-coding
genes (PCG) were identified by the comparison of their
amino-acid sequences using the blastx search BLAST algorithm implemented at the NCBI website http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ and by eye-comparison with
other chelicerate sequences. Annotation of the N- and Cterminal ends of each PCG was checked by comparison
with the translated amino acid sequences of homologous
mt genes for other chelicerates in MEGA ver. 3.1 [49];
MEGA ver. 3.1 was also used for nucleotide composition
analyses.

tRNA genes were initially identified by tRNAScan-SE [50]
using both the generalized mitochondrial and the specific
nematode mitochondrial tRNA settings and by the program ARWEN [51]. Genes found were adjusted by eye to
identify structures more similar to those found in other
chelicerates [cf. [42]]. Non-coding regions were also
searched by eye for stem-loop motifs which could form
part of plausible tRNA-like structures but none were
