Abstract
Surfactant Protein-A (SP-A) is the most prominent among four proteins in the pulmonary
surfactant-system. SP-A is expressed by alveolar epithelial cells type II as well as by a portion of non
small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC).
The expression of SP-A is complexly regulated on the transcriptional and the chromosomal level.
SP-A is a major player in the pulmonary cytokine-network and moreover has been described to act
in the pulmonary host defense.
By the use of cell culture or animal models the functional properties have been repeatedly shown
in many aspects, often bearing surprising properties which strongly indicate the physiological
importance of SP-A. To date SP-A is recognized as a molecule essential for pulmonary
development, structure and function. An upcoming number of reports deals with the role of SP-A
for pulmonary pathology. This article gives an overview about the state of knowledge on SP-A
focused in applications for human pulmonary disorders and points out the importance for
pathology-orientated research approaches using immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization as
promising methods to further elucidate the role of this molecule in adult lung diseases.

Review
Surfactant
The role of the surfactant system for the development of
the human lung is known to be essential. Since it is synthesized by humans starting in the 28th week of pregnancy
and reaching functional levels in the 34th week, surfactantsubstitution-therapy is a fundamental part of the treatment of premature babies suffering from Infant Respiratory Distress Syndrome (IRDS)[1].

Pulmonary surfactant regulates dynamically the alveolar
surface tension. The central role of the surfactant system

for maintaining pulmonary function has been repeatedly
shown by the use of cell culture or animal models [2].
Surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids, carbohydrates
and four proteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, SP-D). The initial
descriptions of surfactant lead back to the 1950s, but little
attention was given to the surfactant proteins until the
1980s [3]. The genes coding for these proteins are located
on different chromosomes. SP-B and SP-C are similarly
structured hydrophobic proteins participating in the
adsorption of phospholipids at the alveolar border, which
leads to rapid reduction of the surface tension. The

hydrophilic proteins SP-A and SP-D are members of the
collectins with C-type lectin domains. SP-D together with
SP-A play a role in the pulmonary defense against Gramnegative bacteria [4].
SP-A: biochemical properties and genetic organization
SP-A is the major surfactant apoprotein exhibiting complex interactions and participation in processes fundamental for pulmonary structure and function with its
expression restricted to alveolar epithelial cells type II.
Moreover expression of SP-A was also described for a portion of NSCLC facilitating a diagnostic marker for these
carcinomas [5,6]. After characterization of the biochemical properties, a complex chromosomal organization of
the genes coding for SP-A has been demonstrated [3]. The
locus of the SP-A on the one hand consists of two functionally active genes and a pseudogene [7,8]. The two
active genes SP-A1 and SP-A2 on the other hand display
several different alleles and splicing variants, moreover
different oligomeric states have been described [3,9]. During the development of the lung these two genes are regulated differentially, a process triggered by cAMP and
glucocorticoids [10]. The SP-A1 and SP-A2 genes display a

http://www.diagnosticpathology.org/content/4/1/8

homology of 94% in their nucleotide sequences and even
96% homology in the amino acid sequences [11]. Fig. 1,
as one example, shows the transcriptional activity of the
SP-A1 and SP-A2 genes determined by RT-PCR in
homogenates of biopsies from NSCLC and corresponding
tumor-free samples. The importance of the differential
transcription of SP-A1 and SP-A2 for maintaining pulmonary function has repeatedly been demonstrated [12].
Phylogenetic analyses revealed that an ancestor proto-SPA gene was diverged into SP-A1 and a second gene which
subsequently emerged to SP-A2 and the SP-A pseudogene
[3]. The high level of homology between SP-A1 and SP-A2
up to date prevents a differential analysis of the two gene
products in situ. The expression of SP-A is also complexly
regulated on the transcriptional level. Moreover the protein-turnover and the release of SP-A into the serum represents a further point of regulation [12]. This
sophisticated regulation of the genetic activity is recognized as a further hint for the functional importance of
SP-A.
SP-A in pulmonary diseases
In recent years the role of defects in the expression of SPA in context with different pulmonary diseases has
become an issue of scientific investigations. Initially
numerous studies have been performed to elucidate the
role of surfactant substitution in pediatrics [2].

As one major function SP-A displays a protective role of
the molecule in pulmonary host defense by interacting
with various infectious agents such as bacteria, fungi and
viruses. SP-A deficient knock-out mice – compared to wild
type animals – are susceptible to infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa [13] and the clearance of group B
streptococcus is slower [14]. In accordance the defense of
SP-A deficient mice against Respiratory Syncytial Virus
(RSV) has been shown to be reduced and may be restored
by exogenous SP-A administration [15-17].
By mediating the attachment of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
to alveolar macrophages and promoting the phagocytosis
of these bacteria, SP-A is important in the pathogenesis of
tuberculosis [18-21]. SP-A also functionally interacts with
staphylococci [22,23], Haemophilus influenza Type A
[24,25], Pneumocystis carinii [26,27], Influenza A Virus (less
efficient than SP-D) [28], Candida tropicalis [29] and
Aspergillus fumigatus [30].

GAPDH.

Moreover, SP-A is involved in the complex pulmonary
network of cytokines as a central player, for example interacting with TNF-alpha and several interleukins
[31,12,14].
Therefore it is likely that defects in the expression of SP-A
may be important in the course of non infectious pulmo-

nary diseases of adult patients. In the case of idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis, for example, low levels of SP-A
(measured by ELISA) have been reported in broncho alveolar lavages (BAL), but elevated levels were found in the
sera [32-34]. Immunohistochemical examinations of the
expression of SP-A in pulmonary fibrosis demonstrated
evident defects by using specimens from different diseases
displaying fibrotic changes in the lungs. In good agreement with the results in BAL reduced levels of SP-A have
been observed in fibrotic lungs. This reduced SP-A-expression in fibrotic lungs may be caused by two reasons: a limited number of the SP-A producing type II pneumocytes
and by a clearly reduced SP-A expression of the remaining
cells [35].
Reduced levels of SP-A have been demonstrated also in
other pulmonary diseases such as the Adult Respiratory
Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and in pneumonia [36].
Keeping in mind that surfactant substitutes are widely
available due to their application in pediatrics, a growing
number of therapeutic possibilities may result from these
findings.
In sarcoidosis elevated levels of SP-A have been described
[37] using BAL; the same applies for the sera from patients
with alveolar proteinosis [38].
Since SP-A represents a central molecule in pulmonary
immunoregulation as well as in host-defense it is obvious
that defects in the surfactant system may have functional
influence in the course of these pulmonary disorders.
Another point of research concerning SP-A is the diagnostic value of this molecule, the expression of which is
restricted to the lungs. It has been reported that SP-A levels
in BAL or serum from patients suffering from idiopathic
pulmonary fibrosis correlate with the progression of the
disease and can be used to predict survival [34,38]. In
samples from airway secretions SP-A measurements are
described to be useful also for the diagnostics of pulmonary edema where elevated levels have been found compared to healthy volunteers and ARDS patients [39]. By
utilizing highly sensitive RT-PCR techniques the amplification of SP-A transcripts can be used for the detection of
occult metastases in non small cell lung cancer patients
[5,40]. Comparative studies of different malignomas with
pulmonary localization have shown the diagnostic properties of immunohistochemically determined SP-A
[6,41,42]. In carcinomas of occult origin localized in the
lungs the diagnosis has a crucial influence on the therapy.
A positive detection of SP-A represents a clear hint for a
primary location in the lung [43]. Fig. 2 as an example
shows the immunohistochemical detection of SP-A in a
moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the lung

using the primary monoclonal antibody PE-10 and LSAB
(AEC-substrate, × 100). The positive staining in the tumor
cells (reddish) in this certain case helped to manifest the
diagnosis as a primary carcinoma of the lung.
However, the choice of a suitable SP-A antibody is highly
important since approaches using polyclonals display
cross reactions with other tumors [44]. This procedure has
already become a part of pathological routine diagnosis,
and – along with other markers such as the Thyroid-transcription-factor-1 (TTF-1) – the detection of SP-A (by PE10) is a useful part of the immunohistochemical panel in
pulmonary pathology.
Immunohistochemical detection of SP-A even might be
utilized for forensic purposes helping to distinguish
between fatal drowning and postmortem immersion [45].

Conclusion
It is evident that SP-A is a molecule which already proves
to be an interesting subject for medical research. However,
the studies concerning the possible role of surfactantdefects in pulmonary diseases of adults have been performed mainly in different cell culture or animal models
hardly analyzing adult human lung tissue. For these reasons SP-A is a promising target for histomorphological
approaches using pathological specimens which exactly
represent the scenarios of various diseases with all the different cell types involved which are difficult to simulate in
models. With the modern tools of molecular pathology,
the genetic activities of genes can be analyzed in situ,
which provides evidence of the cellular activities in the
context of a human native tissue. One example is shown

in Fig. 3: a lung section hybridized with a digoxigeninlabeled SP-A probe to analyze the transcriptional activity
in situ; the reddish signals of the transcripts are visible in
the cytoplasm of type II pneumocytes. When analyzing
the expression of SP-A in histological sections in context
with other molecules of the pulmonary cytokine network
one can expect further clues for the scenarios taking place
in the course of interstitial lung diseases.

Taken together, SP-A is a complexly regulated molecule
with surprising properties and essential importance for
pulmonary development, structure and function which is
getting more and more into focus concerning various diseases of the adult lung. Thus, as an outlook, it will become
an issue of pulmonary pathology which might provide
promising perspectives for applications in research, diagnosis and therapy.
