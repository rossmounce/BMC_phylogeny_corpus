Abstract
Background: PSA (promastigote surface antigen) is one of the major classes of membrane
proteins present at the surface of the parasitic protozoan Leishmania. While it harbours leucine rich
repeats, which are suggestive of its involvement in parasite-to-host physical interactions, its exact
role is largely unknown. Furthermore, the extent of diversity of this gene family, both in copy
number and sequence has not been established.
Results: From the newly available complete genome sequences of L. major, L. infantum and L.
braziliensis, we have established the complete list of PSA genes, based on the conservation of specific
domain architecture. The latter includes an array of leucine rich repeats of unique signature flanked
by conserved cysteine-rich domains. All PSA genes code either for secreted or membraneanchored surface proteins. Besides the few previously identified PSA genes, which are shown here
to be part of a relatively large subclass of PSA genes located on chromosome 12, this study identifies
seven other PSA subtypes. The latter, whose genes lie on chromosomes 5, 9, 21 and 31 in all three
species, form single gene (two genes in one instance) subfamilies, which phylogenetically cluster as
highly related orthologs. On the other hand, genes found on chromosome 12 generally show high
diversification, as reflected in greater sequence divergence between species, and in an extended set
of divergent paralogs. Moreover, we show that the latter genes are submitted to strong positive
selection. We also provide evidence that evolution of these genes is driven by intra- and intergenic
recombination, thereby modulating the number of LRRs in protein and generating chimeric genes.
Conclusion: PSA is a Leishmania family of membrane-bound or secreted proteins, whose main
signature consists in a specific LRR sequence. All PSA genes found in the genomes of three
sequenced Leishmania species unambiguously distribute into eight subfamilies of orthologs. Seven
of these are evolving relatively slowly and could correspond to basic functions related to parasite/
host interactions. On the opposite, the other PSA gene class, which include all so far experimentally
studied PSA genes, could be involved in more specialised adaptative functions.

Background
Leishmania is a parasitic protozoan of the Trypanosomatidae family and is the pathogenic agent of leishmaniases in
humans [1,2]. These diseases are endemic in 88 countries
on five continents, and cover a wide range of symptoms,
from asymptomatic form and benign localised cutaneous
lesions to mucocutaneous lesions and visceral outcome.
While localised cutaneous lesions can be self-healing, the
outcome of the other forms of the disease is more disabling, and the visceral forms are generally fatal if
untreated by chemotherapy. The nature of these symptoms appears statistically associated with the parasite species. L. major and L. tropica mainly produce benign
cutaneous forms, L. braziliensis, mucocutaneous forms
and L. infantum and L.donovani generally cause visceral
disorders. Leishmania undergoes two major developmental stages in its life cycle: one stage in an invertebrate host,
the phlebotomine sand fly and one stage in a vertebrate
host (wide range of hosts such as humans, canids,
rodents, etc.). In the former, it proliferates in the sandfly
gut as a flagellated form, promastigote, and later differentiates into the infectious metacyclic promastigote form
while in vertebrate hosts it proliferates intracellularly as
an a-flagellated form, amastigotes, after infection of macrophages. The parasite transits from one host to the other
when the sandfly feeds by sucking the blood of the vertebrate host.
To understand host-parasite interactions at the molecular
level, many studies have focused on the potential role of
macromolecules present at the surface of the parasite.
These include glycoinositolphospholipids (GIPL), lipophosphoglycan (LPG), as well as the membrane proteins
proteophosphoglycan (PPG), MSP/GP63 endopeptidases, PSA (PSA-2/GP46) and amastins. Most of these
membrane proteins are glycosylated and anchored via a
covalent glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) moiety [3].
Some isoforms of PPG and PSA are also exported outside
the parasite as soluble proteins [4,5]. LPG plays an important role in binding to the phlebotomine midgut. Furthermore, in conjunction with the MSP proteins, it is involved
in the first steps of the vertebrate host infection. They promote resistance to complement, binding to and internalisation in macrophages through the CR3 ligand and
fibronectin receptors, and finally inhibition of the oxidative burst [6,7]. GIPLs and the cysteine proteases CPB are
involved in later stages of infection like protection against
the nitric oxide production and modulation of the
immune response [8].
PSA proteins have been detected in both promastigote
and amastigote stages [9,10]. However, the levels drastically increase from exponentially growing to stationary
phase parasites, which suggests that PSA are strongly overexpressed in metacyclic promastigotes. This overexpres-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/292

sion seems linked with the virulence status of the parasites
since serial passaged in vitro cultured promastigotes with
low virulence do not show this burst of PSA expression in
stationary phase [10]. This expression profile is consistent
with the only known role for PSA: resistance to complement lysis [11]. But other roles are possible, either in the
late parasite-phlebotomine or metacyclic/amastigotemacrophage interactions. The most suggestive functional
determinant in the PSA2 primary structure is the presence
of leucine rich repeats (LRR). LRRs are primarily known to
be involved in protein-protein and protein-glycolipids
interactions. Interestingly, many known LRR containing
proteins are involved in host-pathogen interactions. Yersinia invasin, Listeria internalins and Streptococci LrrG protein are surface proteins that play key roles in binding and
internalisation of these bacteria in their mammalian hosts
[12,13]. Likewise, the mammalian Toll-like receptor and
Nod families [14], and the plant NBS-LRR resistance proteins [15] are primary actors of the innate immunological
system that recognize and bind proteins, glycolipids and
nucleic acids of pathogens.
As for the other membrane proteins above, PSAs are
encoded by multicopy genes. Up to now, only one or two
PSA genes have been described in L. amazonensis [16], L.
major [9] and L. infantum [17], and before the complete
sequencing of L. major genome, the number of copies in a
single species was largely unknown. Here we have taken
advantage of the newly available complete genome
sequences of the three species L. major, L. infantum and L.
braziliensis [18,19] to draw the precise structure of the PSA
gene family. After analysis of the gene phylogeny, which
might serve in the identification of distinct PSA functions,
we have investigated for the presence of recombination
and positive selection as driving forces acting on the evolution of this multigene family.

Results
The PSA gene family
A BLAST search analysis was performed against the complete genome sequences of the three species L. major, L.
infantum and L. braziliensis http://www.genedb.org/, using
as a query sequence some of the PSA protein sequences
reported in the literature. Some genes were discarded from
the candidate PSA genes obtained from this BLAST analysis: LmjF12.1005, LinJ12_v4.0662, LbrM_V2.1660 and
proteophosphoglycan (PPG) genes (4 in each species).
LmjF12.1005 of L. major and LinJ12_v4.0662 of L. infantum, which code for N-terminal truncated forms of PSA
(LmjF12.1005 protein actually lacks a LRR domain) are
probably pseudogenes. LbrM_V2.1660 is almost identical
to gene LbrM_V2.1670, besides harbouring a N-terminal
truncation, but this is questionable since the genomic
sequence immediately upstream LbrM_V2.1660 is lacking, which renders the determination of the N-terminus

uncertain. PPGs indeed possess PSA-related LRR motifs,
but their overall domain architecture differs from that of
PSA proteins. More importantly, PPGs are most probably
functionally different from PSA, owing to their very long
(often more than 1000 residues) serine-rich stretches on
which are anchored very large amounts of phosphoglycan
chains [5]. At the end, 32, 14 and 8 PSA genes were found
in L. major, L. infantum and L. braziliensis, respectively.
Analysis of the primary structure of the encoded PSA proteins reveals that they all possess the same architecture
(Fig. 1). The central part of the protein is composed of
LRRs in tandem. These repeats, which show high variability, both in terms of number of repeats and primary
sequence, are flanked by relatively well conserved
domains, including Cys-rich domains, which are expected
for extracellular LRR-containing proteins [20]. On the Nterminal side of the LRR domain, one finds a 29 to 31 residue-long domain reminiscent of the LRR motif, but
which is clearly not a LRR. This is preceded by a Cx(6)C
domain and finally by a signal peptide. At the other
extremity, the last LRR is followed by a CGCx(23–
26)CxxxxxC containing domain. This marks the end of
the sequence for some PSA proteins. Others have extensions that contain either a Thr/Ser-rich region of variable
length or a transmembrane domain preceded by a Cysrich region, or both. This configuration of a N-terminal
signal sequence and a C-terminal transmembrane domain
predicts that all PSA proteins are either secreted or
anchored to the plasma membrane by their C-terminal
end. Furthermore, all PSA proteins containing a C-termi-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/292

nal transmembrane domain (and a signal peptide) are
predicted to be GPI-anchored (see Fig. 2).
The main signature of PSA proteins is their specific 24–25
amino-acids LRR motif, of consensus sequence G(T/
S)LPxxWxx (M/I)xxLxxLxLxxxx(x)(V/L/I)(S/T) (Fig. 1).
The most striking feature of this motif relative to other
LRRs is the presence of quasi invariant glycine, proline
and tryptophane residues at positions 1, 4 and 7, respectively. This motif is not present in the predicted proteins
from the fully sequenced genomes of two other trypanosomatidae, T. brucei and T. cruzi, and no clear homologs
of PSA could be identified in these organisms. The only
PSA domain for which homology was found in the other
trypanosomatidae is the Thr/Ser-rich domain. The
T(n)KP2 and T(n)EAPT repeats found in most of these
domains are present in T. cruzi mucins. However, while it
makes up the bulk of the mucin protein architecture, this
domain is not always present in PSA proteins (see Fig. 2),
and mucins do not contain any LRR repeat. Therefore, PSA
proteins and mucins are likely to play different roles.
Actually, the LRRs mostly similar to those of Leishmania
PSA proteins belong to the plant NBS-LRR resistance proteins.
PSA genes are dispersed on chromosomes (Chr) 5, 9, 12,
21 and 31 for all three Leishmania species. Chromosomes
9 and 21 contain a single gene, while Chr 5 contains 2
genes, and Chr 31, 3 genes (4 in L. major). PSA genes localised on different chromosomes (and also those of the dif-

Phylogenetic analysis of the PSA gene family
Phylogenetic analysis of the PSA gene family. A phylogenetic tree was inferred by PhyML for a DNA alignment of the PSA
ORFs of L. braziliensis, L. major and L. infantum, excluding the Thr/Ser and Cys-rich/transmembrane C-terminal domains as well
as all but the C-ter most LRR repeat (see Additional file 1). Only bootstrap values (from 500 replicates) greater than 74% are
indicated. Very similar trees (with same significant clustering of genes) were obtained with DNA or protein sequence alignments, using both maximum likelihood or distance methods (not shown). SP: signal peptide; #LRR: number of LRR repeats
(number in brackets refers to additional LRRs that diverge from the consensus LRR sequence). T/S: number of Thr and Ser residues in the Thr-rich domain (or Ser-rich, indicated by (S)). CRTM: cysteine-rich and C-ter transmembrane domains. GPI: GPI

ferent Chr31 loci) are sufficiently divergent to define PSA
gene classes (see below). Inside each chromosome, all
PSA genes are clustered in tandem, except those of Chr 5
and gene LbrM31_V2.3700, which are well separated. The
PSA subfamily present on Chr 12 is the most complex
(except in L. braziliensis where there is only one gene). In
L. major, the 24 Chr 12 PSA genes belong to a single cluster
of tandem repeats, with many of these genes separated by
a single non-related intervening gene. This pattern is also
observed for the 7 Chr12 PSA genes of L. infantum. All PSA
genes arranged in clusters have the same orientation relative to transcription. The only PSA genes studied so far in
vivo belong to the Chr12 array. Although the PSA genes we
have identified on the other chromosomes show significant sequence divergence with the Chr12 genes (see
below), the conservation of the precise domain organisa-

tion between all these genes justifies their being included
in the same unique PSA family.
Phylogeny of the PSA gene family
An alignment of all PSA protein sequences from all three
Leishmania species was generated. For phylogenic analysis,
only the domains present in all PSA proteins were
included in the alignment. The Thr/Ser and Cys-rich/
transmembrane C-terminal domains were thus discarded,
as well as the central LRR domain (except for the last LRR
motif of each sequence, which was retained). LRR units
probably evolve not only by nucleotide substitution but
also by birth and loss of repeats following recombination
events. Therefore, alignments of rather distant LRR
domains (with low similarity between repeats and varying
number of repeats) may not reflect properly their evolu-

tion. This truncated alignment was transformed into its
DNA coding version (Additional file 1), which was used
to generate a phylogenetic tree by PhyML (Fig. 2). This
tree shows the existence of eight PSA subfamilies which
can be defined by their chromosome localisation: Chr5 (A
and B), 9, 12, 21 and three subfamilies on Chr31 (A, B, C).
Subfamilies Chr5A and B are the most distantly related
and pair apart from all other clusters. Among the latter,
only the Chr21/Chr31A subfamilies can be phylogenetically linked with high confidence bootstrap values. Each
of the three Leishmania species has at least one gene in
each of these eight subfamilies. The L. infantum gene
orthologs always group with those of L. major, which is
expected from the known species tree. The relatively short
branch length separating orthologs in comparison to
those separating the inparalogs (ancestors of the seven
gene subfamilies) might suggest that speciation of the
three Leishmania is a late event in the evolution history of
the PSA genes. In keeping with this interpretation, a tree
with similar relative branch lengths was inferred when
using the rate of synonymous substitutions (dS), a more
neutral distance metric (not shown).
Chr5A, B, 9, 21, 31A, B, C subfamilies of PSA genes
While the Chr12 subfamily is most diversified, having
very different numbers (1 to 24) of rather distantly related
paralogs in the three species, the PSA genes lying on the
other chromosomes form very simple clusters. For each of
the latter subfamilies, each species contains a single gene
(except L. major, which has two highly similar paralogs for
the Chr31A cluster) and the orthologs or pseudoorthologs are quite similar (median = 75% amino acid
identity for all three species and 93% for L. infantum/L.
major orthologs). This degree of homology between
orthologs, which was calculated on the same domains
used above for phylogenetic tree determination, was also
observed over the entire LRR domain. Indeed, confident
alignments covering this domain can be obtained inside
each of the Chr5A and B, 9, 21, 31A, B, and C clusters
since the number of LRRs differ at most by one inside each
subfamily and the similarity between orthologs is
(median = 80% amino acid identity for all three species
and 96% for L. infantum/L. major orthologs) (see Additional files 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 for sequence alignments). On
the other hand, similarity between genes of different subfamilies is rather low over this domain (median = 32%
amino acid identity, and much difference in number of
repeats). This may suggest that the LRR domains characteristic of each cluster represent specific binding properties, which could confer specialized roles to their
respective PSA proteins. Another link between these subfamilies and functional specialisation is given by the
nature of the C-terminal domain. Indeed, all members of
the same subfamily share the same membrane anchorage/
secretion determinant. In particular, all genes of the phyl-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/292

ogenetically linked Chr21 and 31A subgroups are predicted to code for secreted proteins (Fig. 2).
Chr12 subfamily of PSA genes
The tree of Fig. 2 shows that the phylogenetic structure of
the Chr12 genes is quite different from that of the above
subfamilies. Here, all genes group according to the species, which suggests that generation of paralogs in L. major
and L. infantum occurred independently in each species.
This clustering pattern was also obtained for an alignment
corresponding to the C-ter extension containing the Cysrich/transmembrane domains of the relevant subset of
Chr12 PSA genes (not shown). We then produced an
alignment of the LRR domain for these Chr12 genes.
Although sequence diversity and variability in numbers of
repeats render this task uncertain, this alignment could be
validated by the high similarity between many genes and
singularities of some LRRs (length of LRRs, sequence specificities). The most robust portion of this LRR alignment
(Additional file 9) was used to generate a phylogenetic
tree (Fig. 3). While many clades were conserved from the
tree of Fig. 2, new well supported clusters were generated.
Notably, two link together genes from L. major and L.
infantum, thus identifying clear orthologs: LmjF12.1090/
LinJ12_v4.0671 and LmjF12.0850, LmjF12.1070/
LinJ12_v4.0663. Phylogenetic analysis scanning of all
individual domains including single LRR repeats confirmed the above orthologies for all LRR repeats except
those at both ends of the LRR domain (not shown). On
the other hand, the N- and C-terminal domains, particularly the signal peptide region and the Cys-rich/transmembrane domain are species specific. The identification
of LmjF12.1090/LinJ12_v4.0671 as orthologous genes
was also strengthened by the absence of C-terminal Cysrich and transmembrane coding domains in their respective ORFs. Yet, these domains are still encoded by very
similar sequences located immediately downstream of the
stop codons, suggesting that a common frameshift mutation resulted in this deletion. Besides the above orthologs,
some clustering of L. infantum with L. major genes was
observed, but with low bootstrap values. New trees were
generated for the L. infantum genes alone, or for those of
L. major, but they did not reveal any new well-supported
clusters. If we consider the LRR domain as the main functional determinant of the PSA protein, the following picture of the genes on Chr12 emerges. In L. infantum, only
two genes (LinJ12_v4.0666 and LinJ12_V3.0690) are
closely related. Besides this clade, the history of the L.
infantum Chr12 genes can not be resolved, due to the
important apparent divergence between the sequences,
which might result in part of recombination events
involving LRR repeats. In L. major, we can distinguish four
clusters of paralogs. Only three of them are supported by
strong bootstrap values. Cluster Lm12B contains the two
pseudo-orthologs of LinJ12_v4.0663. Subgroup C com-

Phylogenetic tree of the LRR domains of PSA genes located on chromosome 12
Phylogenetic tree of the LRR domains of PSA genes located on chromosome 12. A phylogenetic tree was inferred
by PhyML for a DNA alignment of the LRR domain (see Additional files 9 and 13 for protein and DNA alignments, respectively)
of all Chr 12 PSA genes of L. braziliensis, L.major and L. infantum. Bootstrap values (from 500 replicates) greater than 74% are
indicated. Very similar trees (with same significant clustering of genes) were obtained with DNA or protein sequence alignments and by maximum likelihood or distance methods (not shown). SP: signal peptide; #LRR: number of LRR repeats. T/S:

prises seven genes, out of which six code for secreted proteins. As for the LmjF12.1090/LinJ12_v4.0671 genes,
truncation of the Cys-rich and transmembrane domains
in these genes originated from a common non-sense
frameshift mutation. Cluster D comprises seven genes,
five of which are almost identical (>99% nucleotide identity) and were most probably created by recent duplication events. In comparison to L. infantum, L. major has a
much younger cluster of Chr12 genes, with 9 recently
duplicated genes (dS <0.02 and no insertions or deletions). We must note, however, that nearly identical copies of PSA genes might have been missed in the L.

infantum genome assembly, where contigs were assembled solely from shotgun sequence reads.
Recombination in PSA genes
The repetitive nature of the LRR domain and the number
of paralogs imply that recombination has largely contributed to the diversity of the PSA gene. Some recombination
events can be traced in the LRR domains. For example,
while LRRs inside a given PSA protein are generally quite
divergent, nearly identical repeats can be found. For example, LbrM12_V2.0750 has tandem triplicates of a LRR
doublet, and LmjF12.0860, 1020, 1040 have up to 19

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:292

copies of a conserved LRR motif. These nearly exact duplications could have been generated by recent intragenic
cross-overs, or cross-overs involving closely related paralogs. More diverging chimeric genes could result from
intergenic recombination. To detect such events, we partitioned the LRR alignment of the L. major Chr12 genes into
single LRR alignments and inferred the phylogenetic tree
for the most conserved of them. Fig. 4 shows how these
genes cluster according to these LRRs as well as to the conserved regions outside the LRR domain. It can be noticed
that while genes from clade C are quite homogeneous in
their clustering pattern across the entire alignment, others
are more mosaic. This is the case for most of the genes of
clade E, and this probably explains the low resolution
(weak bootstrap values) of this subtree (see Fig. 3). Simple
intergenic recombination events are readily suggested. For

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/292

example, genes LmjF12.0830 and 12.0960 appear to be
chimeric products originating from strand exchanges
between genes belonging to clades D and E. Likewise,
gene LmjF12.0990 must have been generated by the
fusion of the N-terminal pre-LRR domain of a gene from
clade C with a gene of clade D. To validate these conclusions, alignments of relevant PSA gene domains were analysed by SimPlot (Fig. 5) [21]. First, similarity profiles
against the putative chimeric genes (LmjF12.0830,
LmjF12.0960 and LmjF12.0990) show a clear switch
between potential parent genes at the breakpoint region
suggested above in Fig. 4. Second, bootscanning analysis
reveals an alternation of high bootstrap support across the
same regions. Finally, these recombination events are confirmed by analysis of informative sites by the Maximum
Chi-Squared method (Fig. 5).

Analysis 5 chimeric PSA genes by Simplot
Analysis of chimeric PSA genes by Simplot. A) LmjF12.0990. A DNA alignment of the indicated genes covering LRR #2, 9
and the last 4 C-ter most LRRs, together with the N-ter and CGC-C2 flanking domains (Additional file 14) was analysed with
Simplot. Single or multiple genes from each phylogenetic PSA gene cluster of L. major Chr 12 (see Fig. 3) were first used for similarity analysis (Simplot) against the LmjF12.0990 putative chimeric gene. The six genes of cluster 12C were reduced to a consensus sequence. The best pair of candidate parental genes (LmjF12.0760 and consensus sequence for cluster 12C) and a
control gene were then used for bootscanning and informative sites analysis (MaxChi2). B) LmjF12.0960. The same analysis was
performed as in A) using a DNA alignment covering LRR #2, 9 and the last 3 C-ter most LRRs (see Additional file 15).

More profound rearrangements can be created by intergenic recombinations (both at coding and non-coding
sites), which lead to whole gene duplication and deletions. One such rearrangement can be traced in the L.
major Chr12 PSA gene cluster, where PSA genes are organised in tandem, tough often separated by one of two unrelated genes of type A or B. The distribution of these
intervening genes together with the phylogenic signature
of each PSA genes suggest that the two pairs of very similar
paralogs LmjF12.0810/LmjF12.0940 and LmjF12.0830/
LmjF12.0960 were created by a same segmental duplication involving a bloc of five genes (see Additional file 10).

Positive selection of PSA genes
The high gene diversity found for the Chr12 subfamily in
L. major and L. infantum could be indicative of selective
pressure acting on these genes. The preservation of a high
number of paralogs on chromosome 12 (with the exception of the single L. braziliensis Chr12 gene) in comparison
to that of paralogs found on the other chromosomes (one
or two copies only) is itself an indication that diversification is taking place in the Chr12 subfamily. This is
strengthened by the high protein sequence diversity
among the L. infantum and L. major paralogs of Chr 12.
After grouping pairs of genes with dS values below 0.02
(recently duplicated genes) as single entities, we found
that the median pairwise p-distances (calculated over the
coding sequence deleted of the Thr/Ser and Cys-rich/

transmembrane C-terminal domains) for the L. infantum
and L. major Chr12 paralogs were 0.336 and 0.285,
respectively (it was only slightly higher, 0.348, for the L.
infantum-L. major genes pairwise comparison). That is to
compare to the high protein similarity found between the
L. infantum and L. major orthologs of Chr5, 9, 21, 31, ranging from 91 to 95% identity (median = 94%). Orthologs
of PSA genes on Chr5, 9, 21, 31 are therefore much more
conserved even than paralogs of Chr12. To gain a better
insight on selective pressure, we conducted analysis of
ratios of dS, the number of synonymous substitutions per
synonymous sites, to dN, the number of non-synonymous
substitutions per non-synonymous sites, over alignments
covering the entire LRR domain. We calculated a median
dN/dS ratio of 0.26 for the pairwise comparison of Chr5, 9,
21, 31 orthologs of L. infantum and L. major (0.26 when
those of L. braziliensis where included). The pairwise comparison between all genes of Chr12 of L. infantum and L.
major (after grouping pairs of genes with dS values below
0.02 as single entities) revealed a much higher median dN/
dS of 0.74 (0.71 and 0.86 when comparing only paralogs
of L. major and L. infantum, respectively). Fig. 6 shows the
dN/dS versus dS plot of all pairwise comparisons. dN/dS values of the Chr5,9,21,31 orthologs are quite uniformly distributed along the dS axis, well below those of the Chr12
genes, with the exception of two points which refer to the
same LbrM31_V2.1680 gene. It is worth noting that the
dN/dS values associated with the lowest dS values for the
Chr12 paralogs (and where the alignments are the most
confident) are relatively high. The two ortholog pairs of

for each of the Chr5A, B, 9, 12, 21, 31A, B, C PSA gene clusters (including genes of all three Leishmania species; see Additional file 13 for alignment of Chr12 genes). After reducing
very homologous genes (with dS<0.02) to single entities, dN/

somewhat outside the distribution of Chr12 genes
towards low dN/dS values, especially for LmjF12.1090/
LinJ12_v4.0671, whose dN/dS value (0.31) rather falls
inside the Chr5,9,21,31 ortholog values. These results
suggest that the PSA genes on chromosome 5, 9, 21 and
31, as well as orthologs LmjF12.1090/LinJ12_v4.0671
and LmjF12.0850, LmjF12.1070/LinJ12_v4.0663 of chromosome 12 have been more subjected to purifying selection than the other Chr12 genes.
A more incisive method to detect positive selection
involves analysing dN/dS ratios at each codon site. Indeed,
dN/dS ratios calculated over the entire length of the
sequence cannot always identify positive selection (dN/dS
> 1). That is because only a subset of sites in a given gene
is subjected to diversifying selection. The alignment of the
entire coding sequence of the Chr12 genes, except the Cterminal Cys-rich and transmembrane domains was analysed using codeml of the PAML package. Likelihood ratio
test analysis of three pairs of simple and more complex
models of dN/dS categories (M1a/M2a, M7/M8 and M8a/
M8) all revealed the presence of positive selection with
high probabilities (P < 0.001). The M1a/M2a models
comparison predicted the presence of 43 positively
selected sites with P < 0.05 (59 sites with P < 0.1), among
which 33 (44 with P < 0.1) were located in the LRR
domain. Very similar results were obtained with the M7/
M8 and M8a/M8 model comparisons. Codeml also
revealed the presence of positive selection (P < 0.001) in
alignments comprising all Chr 12 genes of either L. infantum or L. major alone, or the 7 closely related genes of L.
major 12B cluster (see tree of Fig. 3). On the other hand,
PSA genes on the other chromosomes could not be analysed properly by codeml: each of these phylogenetically
defined clusters possess too few genes (2 to 4), and those
often offer poor diversity. It is known that inference of
positive selection by codeml can lead to false positives
when the genes under investigation have a recombination
history [22]. To minimise the impact of recombination,
we performed codeml analysis on single or contiguous
pairs of LRRs of the Chr12 genes. The majority of these
analyses revealed the presence of positive selection and
could identify sites under positive selection. Under model
M8, still 15 such sites were found at P < 0.05 for pairs of
LRRs. We then asked if the numerous predicted positively
selected sites found above by codeml for the entire LRR
domain of Chr12 genes corresponded to particular positions in each LRR. Fig. 7A shows that all these sites are
located at non-conserved sites of the LRR consensus

sequence. The posterior dN/dS values calculated at each site

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/292

was determined for each residue position in the LRR (Fig.
7B). As expected, variable positions have higher dN/dS val-

computer modelling of several LRR domains in other proteins allow for the prediction of the positioning of residues outside or inside the LRR domain 3D structure [23].
The relatively well conserved hydrophobic residues are
involved in structuring of the consecutive α-helices and

ues than more conserved positions. An even better correlation is observed if we consider the localisation of the
sites in the 3D structure of the LRRs. Crystal structures and

β -sheet domains of the LRRs that arrange into a horseshoe shape, and are buried inside the structure. On the

outward. It is clear from Fig. 7A that positively selected
sites all correspond to positions predicted to reside at the
surface of the LRR domain structure. In addition, the latter
positions have higher posterior mean values of dN/dS (Fig.
7B).
3' Intergenic region
Expression of some PSA genes of Chr12 has been shown
to be stage specific. Strong increases in the levels of both
mRNA and protein were observed during metacyclogenesis in vitro [10]. This regulation was shown to depend on
the 3' intergenic region (IR) of the PSA gene [17]. The
question arises, then, as to whether the different classes of
PSA might be regulated the same way. We therefore
wished to compare the phylogeny of the 3' (IR) to that
obtained above for the coding sequence. Around 2 kb of
the 3' IR of PSA genes from all three Leishmania species
(with few exceptions for L. infantum and L. braziliensis due
to gaps in their sequences) were analysed by local BLAST
and aligned by Dialign2. We found that the 3' IRs are conserved between all orthologs (and pseudo-orthologs for
he Chr12 clade), but show no significant homology
between genes of the 8 different PSA clades (05, 09, 12,
21, 31A, B, C). While the similarities found for pairwise
comparisons involving L. braziliensis sequences are variable and relatively low, those of the other comparisons are
high. The L. infantum/L. major orthologs of clades 5, 9, 21,
31A, B, C are equally well conserved (ranging from 87 to
92% identity; see Additional file 11 for sequence alignments), as are the set of pseudo-orthologs and paralogs of
clade 12 (median = 95% identity; see Additional file 12
for sequence alignment). Yet, the alignment of the 3' IR of
these Chr12 PSA genes is quite mosaic, showing large
blocks of deletions/insertions. Phylogenetic analysis of an
alignment retaining 1.2 kb of domains conserved in at
least 70% of the genes revealed that Chr12 genes cluster
according to the species (not shown). This is reminiscent
of the extremities of the coding regions (Fig. 2). Functional studies will be necessary to determine if this high
degree of conservation is the result of gene conversion or
rather, of purifying selection driven by imperatives of gene
expression. In any case, if indeed the 3' IR of the different
PSA clades play a role in the control of gene expression,
either the pattern of expression is variable between the
clades or the cues governing this control are subtler than
the primary sequence per se.

Discussion and Conclusion
Thanks to the whole genome sequencing of three Leishmania species, we could draw the complete picture of the PSA
gene family. Up to now, only a few genes belonging to the
Chr12 subfamily had been characterised. Also, L. braziliensis was thought not to contain any gene for that subfamily.
We have proposed a nomenclature for all PSA genes (see
Fig. 2 and 3). We have kept the PSA letters, even tough it

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/292

is now known that these genes are expressed both in promastigote and amastigote stages and code not only for
membrane proteins at the surface of the parasite but also
for excreted soluble proteins. Follow the chromosome
number and other symbols that refer to the phylogenetic
PSA gene clusters.
PSAs are basically LRR repeats containing proteins, which
are either membrane-bound at the surface of Leishmania
or soluble as excreted proteins. These features suggest that
this protein family could be involved in host-parasite
interactions. The diversity found in PSAs, which concerns
mainly the LRR domain, would be consistent with this
role. This diversity is not accounted only by the sequence
divergence of the LRR repeats but also by the number of
these repeats present in each protein, which varies from 2
to 25 and could influence both the shape and the space
occupied by PSAs, and thereby their binding properties.
Two other factors of diversity in PSA reside outside the
LRR domain. One concerns the Thr/Ser-rich domain,
whose length varies considerably and can be totally
absent in some PSAs. Although there is some indication
that PSAs could be glycosylated [24,25], both the sites of
glycosylation and the nature of the amino acid-glycan
linkage are unknown. Most of these Thr/Ser-rich domains
contain a signature present in T. cruzi mucins which is
known to be the site of O-glycosylation. Finally, membrane attachment determinants (which result mostly in
anchoring through GPI) define two destinations for PSA
proteins: excretion or attachment to the parasite's surface.
Although the majority are predicted to be membrane
bound, PSAs predicted to be secreted are found both as
strongly conserved proteins between species (PSA21 in all
three species; LiPSA12A and LmPSA12A) and as species
specific proteins (LiPSA12I and most LmPSA12C). This
suggests that the presence of these C-terminal truncated
forms of PSAs is neither fortuitous nor the products of
pseudogenes, but that secretion plays a fundamental role
in Leishmania.
PSA genes distribute into eight subfamilies. In view of the
found orthologies, the most parsimonious scenario
would be that the last common ancestor (LCA) of L.
major, L. infantum and L. braziliensis had nine genes: one
in each of chromosomes 9, 12 and 21, two on chromosome 5 and three on chromosome 31. Among the PSA
subfamilies, the Chr12 subfamily is the most diversified
one, at least in L. major and L. infantum. This is brought
about by nucleotide substitutions as well as unequal gene
recombination, which modulates both the number of
LRRs in PSA proteins and the number of genes in the family, and generates chimeric genes. The evolution of the
Chr12 subfamily of PSA genes is probably best explained
by a birth-and-loss process, by which the gene family is
either expanded or contracted, while PSA genes are indi-

vidually submitted to diversifying selection. We have
detected clear evidence of positive selection for the Chr12
genes in both L. major and L. infantum, while the existence
of orthologs, divergent paralogs, as well as probable pseudogenes (LmjF12.1005, LinJ12_v4.0662) all point to a
birth-and-loss model. We note, however, that the extremities of the coding regions and the 3' IR of the Chr12 PSA
genes are all species specific (no orthologies can be
inferred) and remarkably similar (some stretches are even
devoid of synonymous substitutions), suggesting that
some gene homogenisation might have taken place by
gene conversion. In contrast to the Chr12 subfamily, the
seven other subfamilies seem to evolve in a more conservative way. Not only all genes of Chr5, 9, 21 and 31 from
the three Leishmania species cluster as more similar
orthologs but evidence of recombination is scarce. One
finds only one pair of paralogs (the L. major Chr31A subfamily), and the number of LRR repeats is the same for
each group of orthologs (except one difference in Chr21
subfamily). Furthermore, diversifying selection apparently does not act on these genes, as evidenced by dN/dS
values well under those obtained for the Chr12 genes. We
would therefore postulate the latter subfamilies to be
involved in basic slowly evolving host-parasite interactions, whereas the Chr12 subfamily could be linked to
more dynamic adaptative responses like optimisation of
cellular infection (internalisation and maintenance in the
macrophage) and escape from the immune system. The
latter could also be related to the Leishmania species identities like the nature of the sand fly species infected and
the clinical symptoms. Still, diversification of Chr12 genes
apparently does not offer any advantage for L. braziliensis.
At this stage, it is hard to find out what kind of adaptative
role these genes could play in L. major and L. infantum,
which would be dispensable for L. braziliensis.
Diversifying selection has been shown to drive evolution
of genes involved in host-pathogen interactions. These
include virulence genes, as found in Streptococci [26] and
Listeria monocytogenes [27], as well as resistance genes, like
the numerous plant NBS-LRR genes [28], the primate
Trim5α [29] genes involved in restriction of retroviruses
replication and many gene classes involved in the Drosophila innate immune system [30]. Interestingly, the Listeria virulence gene inlA and the NBS-LRR genes possess
LRR domains, which were shown to evolve under positive
selection. In the present work, we found that in the Chr12
PSA gene subfamily of two Leishmania species, LRR
domains evolve under strong positive selection. Most
notably, the several residues submitted to diversifying
selection are predicted to reside at the protein's surface.
The importance of this evolving LRR protein interface in
the parasite's life cycle awaits the determination of the
precise PSA biological function and the identification of
eventual host PSA interactors.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/292

In conclusion, we have identified eight PSA subfamilies.
The phylogenetic distance separating them, which is paralleled by the divergence of their LRR domains, appears
large enough to reflect functional specificities. The strong
conservation of the orthologs of the subfamilies 5A, 5B, 9,
21, 31A, B and C suggest that they play essential roles.
Generation of knock outs and gene expression analysis of
all individual PSA genes will be needed to explore the
importance of these genes in the different stages of the life
cycle of Leishmania, and eventually in adaptation of the
parasites to their specific insect or mammalian host. In
comparison to the seven subfamilies above, the PSA12
subfamily is evolving much more rapidly, (at least in L.
major and L. infantum) as revealed by the high number of
paralogs and the presence of strong diversifying selection.
Sequencing of these genes in several strains of L. major and
L. infantum is expected to show a high incidence of polymorphism.

Methods
Alignment of PSA amino acid and nucleotide sequences
and identification of membrane anchorage determinants
PSA protein and DNA sequences were extracted from the
L. major, L. infantum and L. braziliensis database http://
www.genedb.org/ after BLAST analysis. The latest versions
of the genome sequences were used, i.e. 5.2 for L. major,
2.0 for L. braziliensis and 3.0 (and 4.0 for chromosome 12)
for L. infantum. Protein sequences were aligned with ClustalX 2.0 [31] followed by manual correction. These alignments were transposed to the corresponding genomic
DNA alignments by protal2dna http://mobyle.pasteur.fr/
cgi-bin/MobylePortal/portal.py?form=tranalign.
The
presence of signal peptide and transmembrane domains
was reported as found in annotations of the Leishmania
genomes http://www.genedb.org/. The prediction of GPIanchorage was performed by GPI-SOM http://
gpi.unibe.ch/[32]. Genomic sequences flanking the PSA
ORFs in 3' were aligned with Dialign 2.2.1 [33].
Phylogenetic analysis
Phylogenetic trees of Fig. 2 and 3 were obtained from
nucleotide sequence alignments by maximum likelihood
(PhyML v2.4.4) [34]. The selection of the nucleotide substitution model (and eventually of amino acids substitution) was determined by ModelGenerator http://
distributed.cs.nuim.ie/multiphyl.php[35]. The HKY+I+G
(Fig. 2) and TN93 +G+I (Fig. 3) nucleotide models were
used, with the base frequency, Ts/Tv ratio, and gamma
distribution parameter estimated by PhyML. These trees
were compared to those obtained by PhyML from the corresponding amino acid sequences (WAG+G model of
amino acids substitution) or with a distance method
implemented in MEGA v3.1 [36] using both DNA (TN93)
or amino acids (JTT model) alignments. Occasionally (see
text in Results section), a codon model (dS, number of

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:292

synonymous substitutions per synonymous sites; NeiGojobori method, JC model) as implemented in MEGA
was used to calculate distance matrix. Trees were annotated and visualised by Treedyn (v194.3) [37].
Positive selection
One level of positive selection analysis involved calculation of dN/dS ratios between pairs of sequences (MEGA,
Nei-Gojobori method, JC model). ω = dN/dS < 1 corresponds to purifying (negative) selection, ω = 1 to neutral
evolution (absence of selection), and ω > 1 indicating
adaptive evolution (positive selection). The maximum
likelihood based method implemented in the codeml
program of the PAML package (v3.15) [38] was used to
detect positive selection as well as identifying positively
selected sites, when the number of related sequences was
sufficiently high. To detect positive selection, we performed likelihood ratio test (LRT) analysis between three
pairs of models to determine whether particular models
provided a significantly better fit to the data: M1a
("Nearly-Neutral" model) vs. M2a ("PositiveSelection"
model), M7 ("beta" model) vs. M8 ("beta&ω" model) and
M8a vs. M8. Only models M2a and M8 allow for site categories evolving under positive selection (see Yang et al.
2005 [39] for further details on the models). Positive
selection is inferred when the (2Δλ) statistic is greater than
critical values 1) of the Chi square distribution for a
degree of freedom of 2 (M1a/M2a. and M7/M8 comparisons) or 2) of a 50:50 mixture of point mass 0 and Chi
square (critical values are 2.71 at 5% and 5.41 at 1%;
M8a/M8 comparison). Only predicted positively selected
sites with posterior BEB (Bayes empirical Bayes) probabilities greater than 0.95 or 0.90 were retained.
