Abstract
Background: Previous work from our laboratory showed that (i) vertebrate genomes are
mosaics of isochores, typically megabase-size DNA segments that are fairly homogeneous in base
composition; (ii) isochores belong to a small number of families (five in the human genome)
characterized by different GC levels; (iii) isochore family patterns are different in fishes/amphibians
and mammals/birds, the latter showing GC-rich isochore families that are absent or very scarce in
the former; (iv) there are two modes of genome evolution, a conservative one in which isochore
patterns basically do not change (e.g., among mammalian orders), and a transitional one, in which
they do change (e.g., between amphibians and mammals); and (v) isochores are tightly linked to a
number of basic biological properties, such as gene density, gene expression, replication timing and
recombination.
Results: The present availability of a number of fully sequenced genomes ranging from fishes to
mammals allowed us to carry out investigations that (i) more precisely quantified our previous
conclusions; (ii) showed that the different isochore families of vertebrate genomes are largely
conserved in GC levels and dinucleotide frequencies, as well as in isochore size; and (iii) isochore
family patterns can be either conserved or change within both warm- and cold-blooded
vertebrates.
Conclusion: On the basis of the results presented, we propose that (i) the large conservation of
GC levels and dinucleotide frequencies may reflect the conservation of chromatin structures; (ii)
the conservation of isochore size may be linked to the role played by isochores in chromosome
structure and replication; (iii) the formation, the maintainance and the changes of isochore patterns
are due to natural selection.

Background
Investigations carried out in our laboratory over many
years led to a general picture of the organization of the
vertebrate genome and its evolution. We recall here very
briefly that the vertebrate genome is a mosaic of isochores,
typically megabase-size DNA segments that belong in a
small number of families characterized by different GC
levels, and that are tightly associated with basic genome

properties such as gene density, gene expression, replication timing and recombination (see refs. [1,2] for
reviews). Remarkably, the isochore family patterns
(hencefrom indicated as isochore patterns) of mammals
and birds were found to be strikingly different from those
of amphibians and fishes. Most of our previous results
were obtained through a compositional approach that
mainly involved (i) DNA fractionation using ultracentrifPage 1 of 17

ugation in density gradients in the presence of sequencespecific ligands; (ii) cytogenetic analyses; and (iii) gene
and genome sequences, when this became possible.
The recent availability of a number of fully sequenced vertebrate genomes allowed us to quantify very precisely our
previous results. This approach was started by scanning
GC levels [3] in the first fully sequenced vertebrate
genome, the human genome (see Materials and Methods
for details and comments on segmentation approaches).
The number-average size of compositionally fairly homogeneous regions, the isochores, was found to be 0.9 Mb
(megabases), the weight-average 1.9 Mb (the numberaverage is the classical average of all size values; the
weight-average is the average of values multiplied by their
amounts). When isochores were pooled in bins of 1% GC,
their distribution confirmed that they belonged in the five
families that had been previously described (L1, L2, H1,
H2 and H3, in order of increasing GC) [4].
The euchromatic regions of human chromosomes were
completely covered by 3200 isochores that formed the
ultimate chromosomal bands [5]. In contrast, the
genomes of the cold-blooded vertebrates (fishes)
explored so far at the sequence level expectedly showed a
much lower compositional heterogeneity and were characterized by less complex isochore patterns [6]. We used
here, as in previous papers [4], the old-fashioned distinction between cold- and warm-blooded vertebrates in
order to stress the link that we proposed to exist between
genome structure (and thermodynamic stability) and
body temperature (whatever its origin, homeothermy,
behavioural regulation, environmental temperature), a
point clearly made in our previous work (see ref. [1] for a
review).
In the present work we analyzed at the sequence level the
genomes of Eutherians not yet explored by us, namely
chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), mouse (Mus musculus) and
dog (Canis familiaris), a Marsupial, the opossum (Monodelphis domestica) and a Monotreme, the platypus (Ornithorhynchus anatinus). Some comparative data from a
Reptile (Anolis carolinensis) and an Amphibian (Xenopus
tropicalis) are also presented, even if these genome
sequences are only available as scaffolds. Since we had
previously investigated the fully sequenced human, fish
and chicken genomes [3,6,7], we could approach here the
general problem of the organization and evolution of vertebrate genomes at the sequence level.

Results
The isochore families: the patterns
When isochores from vertebrate genomes are pooled in
bins of 1% GC [3], or 0.5% GC as in the present work, and
plotted against their GC levels, isochore families appear,

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/146

as expected from previous investigations. A comparison of
the isochore patterns of vertebrate genomes involves the
assessment of the relative amounts of the isochore families and of their average GC levels. These are reported
below.
As expected, two Primates (human and chimpanzee) and
a Carnivore (dog) showed a large similarity in the relative
amounts of the isochore families, whereas in mouse L1
isochores were poorly represented and H3 isochores were
essentially absent (Figure 1 and Table 1).
In opossum, L1 isochores were much more represented
than in Eutherians and GC-rich isochores H2 and H3 were
very scarce (Figure 1 and Table 1). This pattern might be
due to interspersed repeats that represent about 50% of
this genome. This possibility was disproven, however, by
two findings: (i) repeats were distributed over all isochore
families with only a slightly higher concentration in GCpoor families; and (ii) the base composition of repeats
was quite close to those of "unique" contiguous sequences
(see Additional file 1).
In contrast to the genomes of Eutherians and chicken (see
below), which showed an average GC level of about 41%,
and to the GC-poorer genome of opossum (~38% GC),
the platypus genome, which has a size of approximately
2.4 Gb (only 18% of which are assembled, the remaining
sequences being available as supercontigs) showed a high
GC level of 43.4%. This genome essentially consisted of
L2 and H1 isochores with a small amount of H2 isochores
(Figure 1 and Table 1), a result due in part to the missing
assembly of GC-rich microchromosomes. Indeed, when
the GC profile of the unassembled sequences was superimposed on the isochore profile of the platypus genome
(see Additional file 2), it became clear that the unassembled parts essentially corresponded to GC-rich chromosomal regions (as in the case of chicken; see below).
In the chicken genome (Figure 2 and Table 1), which has
a size about 1/3 of the human genome, all isochore families were very slightly shifted toward GC-rich values compared to the human distribution. Moreover, L1 isochores
were underrepresented in the genome and a GC-richest
H4 isochore family was present, even if in very small
amounts in the currently available assembly. This data
still lacks some microchromosomes, all of which are
known to be very GC-rich [8].
The isochore families of the fully sequenced fish genomes
(Figure 2 and Table 1) were already described [6]. In each
of the four genome sequences only two isochore families
were present (L1 and L2 in the case of zebrafish), or predominant (L2 and H1 in medaka, H1 and H2 in stickle-

They were not included in calculating the standard deviation in A.
(b) Values in parenthesis are likely to be at least in part artefactually
large.

Unfortunately, only scaffolds were available for the
genomes of a reptile (Anolis carolinensis) and of an
amphibian (Xenopus tropicalis). When-100 kb segments of
these scaffolds were binned and compared with similar
histograms for the human and medaka (Oryzias latipes)
genomes, the compositional heterogeneities of the anolis
and xenopus genomes were found to be much lower than
that of the human genome and rather close to that of the
genome of medaka, the compositionally closest fish
genome (Figure 3).
The isochore families: the GC levels and the dinucleotide
frequencies
In spite of the different relative amounts of isochore families found within and among vertebrate classes (but practically not between Eutherians and chicken), the average
GC levels of isochores belonging to the different families
were remarkably conserved (see Figures 1 and 2 and Table
1). Because of their possible functional relevance in connection with chromatin structure [9], dinucleotide frequencies were also assessed as observed/expected ratios in
different isochore families. These ratios were extremely
close between human, mouse, opossum and platypus in
each of the isochore families (Figure 4), whereas the ratios
of anolis and xenopus (Figure 5) diverged slightly from
the ratios seen in mammals. In the human/fish comparison (Figure 6), practically no differences were found in
AA, TT, AT and TA, but CpG was higher in fish DNA than
in human, as expected from the lower body temperature
of fishes [10].
The isochore sizes
The average size of isochores in the different families
showed a remarkable conservation in all vertebrates, from
fish to human, again in spite of the differences in the relative amounts of isochore families (see Figure 7 and Table
1). This stability of isochore size within isochore families
was accompanied, however, by systematic differences
between isochore families, in particular (i) a larger size
(>1 Mb) and a larger spread of the GC-poorest isochore
families (L1 in zebrafish and mammals, except for mouse,
L2 in medaka and H1 in stickleback; see Additional file 3
and Discussion); (ii) a smaller size (<1 Mb) and a narrower size distribution of the GC-rich isochores; and (iii)
a regular decrease from L1 to H3 isochore families.

Additional Files 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 (Tables T1âT5)
present the coordinates, sizes, GC levels and differences in
GC between isochores for the genomes of chimpanzee,
dog, mouse, opossum and platypus. Additional Files 4, 5,
6, 7 and 8 display the corresponding GC profiles.

Gene densities
The gene densities of all isochore families (Figure 8)
showed an increase with increasing GC in both warm- and
cold-blooded vertebrates, as expected from previous
results (see ref. [1] for a review). In the case of xenopus,
genes were localized on the scaffolds and gene densities
were shown to follow the general trend of all vertebrates
(see Figure 8). The only exception to this general rule was
that of zebrafish, in which case the most represented L1
family had a slightly higher gene density compared to L2
isochores. The reasons for such a situation are under current investigation. Gene density was not calculated in the
case of anolis because the coordinates of genes on the scaffolds are not yet available.

Discussion
The two modes of genome evolution: the transitional
mode
It should be recalled that a transitional (or shifting) mode
in genome evolution was originally indicated by the gaussian analysis of buoyant density profiles of DNA (and
DNA fractions) from cold- and warm-blooded vertebrates
[11]. In this mode, large changes occurr in isochore patterns. More specifically, GC-rich isochores were found to
be absent or scarce in the carp and xenopus genome,
respectively, compared to the genomes of human, mouse
and chicken [4], and similar differences were seen in
orthologous genes [12]. Interestingly, the transitional
mode of the genome evolution could also be observed at
the cytogenetic level because the compositional heterogeneity of genomes is reflected in the chromosomal banding
patterns (see ref [1] for a review). These findings indicate
the existence of correlations linking compositional heterogeneity, chromatin structure and banding patterns. The
transitional mode of evolution could now be checked on
several vertebrate genomes at the sequence level with a
much higher degree of precision.

The compositional differences of the genomes of human
and xenopus were originally attributed to the different
body temperature of warm- and cold-blooded vertebrates
[13]. This "thermodynamic stability hypothesis"
accounted for the higher GC level of DNA and RNA.
Moreover, it was noted that GC-rich codons preferentially
encode aminoacids that confer thermal stability to the
corresponding proteins. This latter point was recently confirmed by showing [9] that, out of 18,795 human genes,
those located in GC-rich isochores have an increased level
of GC-rich codons leading to higher levels of stabilizing
aminoacids (such as arginine and alanine) and lower levels of destabilizing aminoacids (such as lysine, isoleucine
and asparagine). Expectedly, the opposite was found in
genes located in GC-poor isochores.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/146

The thermodynamic stability hypothesis is now supported by several new findings (i) the isochore patterns of
anolis, xenopus and fishes (except for pufferfish; but see
(iv) below) lack the GC-richest isochores present in the
human pattern; (ii) the predominant GC-poor isochores
of opossum might be related, at least in part, to the lower
body temperature (32Â°C) of this marsupial; (iii) the small
shift to the GC-rich side of the isochore distribution of
chicken and the presence of a small GC-richest H4 isochore family might be related to the higher body temperature (41Â° â 43.5Â°C) [14] of birds compared to
mammals; (iv) the shift to the GC-rich side of the tetraodon genome, a fish living in tropical freshwater contrasts
with the isochore pattern of fugu, a fish (from the same
family) living at a lower temperature in the Pacific Ocean
[14] (see also Additional File 9 and Supplementary Figure
S6 from ref. [6]); (v) the isochore patterns of reptiles, a
class of vertebrates known to be characterized by different
body temperatures and different thermal regulations
cover a broad spectrum; indeed, genomes may either be
even more compositionally homogeneous than the xenopus genome (e.g., the anolis genome; see Figure 3), or
show the presence of GC-rich isochores (as in the case of
Testudo graeca and Crocodylus niloticus [15]); the latter
point was recently confirmed by comparing GC3 (the GC
level of third codon position) of orthologous genes from
Alligator mississippiensis, human and chicken [16]; (vi)
both mammals and birds, two classes of vertebrates
derived at different times from different ancestral reptiles
(Therapsids about 220 Mya and Dinosaurs, about 150
Million years ago, respectively, [17]), showed the formation of the same families of GC-rich isochores (compare
the human and the chicken patterns of Figures 1 and 2), a
clear indication of a convergent compositional evolution;
likewise, a convergent evolution may be the explanation
for the similarity of GC3 values of orthologous genes from
alligator and chicken; indeed, there is no compelling reason to consider common descent from archosaurs as the
explanation [16], given the large phylogenetic distance
[18,19], the complex endo-ectothermic evolution of crocodiles [20], and the contrasting data on the cold- or warmbloodedness of the immediate ancestors of birds, dinosaurs; (vii) the excess of AT â GC over GC â AT changes
observed in the genes of Gillichthys seta, a fish living at
40Â°C, compared to the orthologous genes of Gillicthys
mirabilis, a congeneric fish living at 20Â°C [21]; interestingly, the former one was characterized by positive selection on some genes and by an expansion of a GC-rich
minisatellites in gene-rich regions.
The explanation why only the gene-rich regions of the
genome and not the whole genomes underwent a GC
increase was provided by the finding that those regions
have an open chromatin structure ([22], as also shown by
accessibility to DNAse I [23], and to apoptotic and MNase

degradation [24]), whereas the gene-poor regions could
be stabilized by their own compact chromatin. This point
is supported by the finding that, when the body temperature change is very rapid, as in the case of the divergence
of G. seta from G. mirabilis (<0.66â0.75 Million years
ago), the gene-rich regions of the genome are stabilized by
the regional expansion of a very GC-rich minisatellite (see
above).
Since the thermal stability hypothesis is based on general
physical-chemical properties, it would be expected to be
valid very widely. This is, indeed, the case as shown by the
correlation of GC levels of paired sequences (stems) of
ribosomal 18S RNAs with body temperature for vertebrates ranging from mammals to polar fishes (differences
being seen even between eutherians, 37Â°C body temperature, and both marsupials and monotremes, 32Â°C body
temperature, [25]) and by the correlation of GC levels and
optimal growth temperatures of prokaryotes [26].
While body temperature seems to be a major determinant
of the compositional properties of genome, other factors
may also play a role. This is clearly indicated by the different isochore patterns of fishes. In this case not only temperature, but other environmental factors such as salinity,
oxygen level, pH etc. are possibly involved. The compositional differences found between eutherians and
monotremes that have different body temperatures (37Â°
vs 32Â°) require further investigations to be understood.
We know, however, that CpG and 5 mC values of
monotremes are intermediate between the low values of
eutherians and the high values of fishes [[1,27] and
present work] (see Figure 6), as expected from their body
temperature.
It should be stressed that, while the original observations
pointed to a shifting mode of genome evolution in the
case of the compositional transition between cold- and
warm-blooded vertebrates, which is now confirmed on a
sequence basis, the present results indicate the existence
of a shifting mode even within cold- (e.g., fishes) and
warm-blooded vertebrates (e.g., marsupials vs. eutherians).
The two modes of genome of genome evolution: the
conservative mode
The other, conservative, mode, in which the isochore patterns are maintained over evolutionary time, was found in
eutherian genomes that displayed the "general compositional pattern" (e.g., human, chimp and dog genomes; as
opposed to the mouse pattern; see below). Some differences in the relative amounts of isochore families were
observed, but they were within narrow limits and
appeared to be essentially due to differences in the relative
amounts of interspersed sequences, as well as to inser-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/146

tions/deletions. Moreover, when isochores from MHC
loci of human and mouse [28], or from synthenic chromosome regions of human and dog were examined (see
Figure 4 from ref. [2] for an example), a high degree of
conservation was found. Incidentally, the narrower isochore pattern of mouse was interpreted as due to an
increased mutation rate [29,30] and a poor repair mechanism [31], two phenomena leading to some decrease of
compositional heterogeneity.
The conservative mode was found in the present work to
be further characterized by two remarkable properties that
concerned the conservation in each isochore family of all
vertebrate genomes investigated of (i) the average isochore size (with some limitations; see below); and (ii) the
GC levels and dinucleotide frequencies. The conservation
of the average isochore size may be correlated with the
isochore role in chromosome organization. Indeed, it
should be recalled here that the number of isochores estimated by us for the human genome, ~3200, is in agreement with the maximum number, 3000, of the highest
resolution bands as assessed by Yunis et al. [32] and that
the boundaries of isochores coincide with those of chromosomal bands as obtained at the resolution of 850
bands (see Figure 6 from ref. [5]). Moreover, isochores
have been observed to coincide with replication units
[33].
As far as the larger size of the GC-poorest isochore families
of vertebrates is concerned, this may be due to the preferred insertion in these families of interspersed repeated
sequences, as well as to sequence expansion phenomena
[1]. Unfortunately, the presence of gaps (in medaka) or
their surprising absence (in stickleback) may also contribute a possibly important artefactual component to the
large size of GC-poor isochores [6]. This implies that more
complete sequence data will be needed in order to obtain
reliable assessments of the GC-poorest isochore size of
medaka, stickleback (and also of zebrafish, opossum and
chimpanzee).
The conservation of GC level and dinucleotide frequencies of isochore families can be understood by recalling
that these frequencies were consistently different in the
different isochore families from the human genome [9].
Such differences are likely to influence protein/DNA interactions and, therefore, chromatin structure, possibly
through nucleosome positioning [34]. In turn, the existence of five isochore families suggested that a discrete
number of chromatin structures are present in eutherian
mammals. The different DNase accessibility of chromatin
corresponding to isochores from different families
[23,24] may be viewed as an indication along this line.

BMC Genomics 2009, 10:146

The conservative mode of evolution was originally
explained by "negative selection acting at a regional (isochore) level to eliminate any strong deviation from the
presumably functionally optimal composition of isochores" [35]. A number of findings, accumulated during
the past twenty years [1,2] and those presented in this
paper, support this hypothesis.
An alternative proposal for the formation and maintenance of isochores was that "biased gene conversion
(BGC) is probably the most likely cause of isochores"
[36]. This proposal has found a large number of supporters (see for example refs. [37,38]. While nobody disputes
the existence and the importance of BGC, the link with the
formation and maintenance of isochores has been the
object of a debate. Indeed, there are some major problems
with such a link. The first problem is that the randomness
of a neutral process such as BGC and its changes in evolutionary time would lead to a tremendous variability of
compositional patterns in vertebrate genomes. One
would not expect, for instance, the conservation of isochore patterns in eutherian orders that have diverged
about one hundred million years ago and have changed
about half of the nucleotide that form their genomes [2].
The second problem is that entire vertebrate classes,
orders and families (such as the class of amphibians, the
vast majority of fish orders and a number of reptilian families) do not show the formation of GC-rich isochores and
just show a conservative mode of evolution. The third
problem is the lack of evidence, or even of models and
hypotheses, concerning the expansion process from the
rare, small-size BGC events (in the hundreds of bp scale)
[39] to megabase regions.
In other words, if isochores were originating from BGC
events, one should not expect the conservation of GC levels, sizes and (at least in Eutherians and chicken) of the
relative amounts of isochore families, nor the very high
similarity of GC and GC3 levels in orthologous genes from
eutherians and birds. Instead, one should see differences
in compositional patterns, and such differences should
concern individual classes, orders and families of vertebrates.

Conclusion
The present results reinforce our previous conclusions
(see refs. [1,2] for reviews) concerning the mosaic organization of isochores in vertebrate genomes, the differences
between the isochore patterns of warm- and cold-blooded
vertebrates, the distribution of genes and the two modes
(transitional and conservative) of genome evolution.
Expectedly, the sequence level of the present data provide
much more detailed pictures. In particular, they lead for
the first time to the discovery that GC levels, dinucleotide
frequencies (except for CpG in fishes) and isochore sizes

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/146

from corresponding isochore families are conserved in all
vertebrate genomes. These novel findings are not compatible with BGC as an explanation for the origin and conservation of isochores. This leaves the original proposal of
natural selection [1,2,13] as the most plausible explanation for the origin and the maintenance of isochores, that
represent, indeed, "a fundamental level of genome organization" [36].

Methods
Isochore mapping: the methodology
The methodology used for isochore mapping was
described by Costantini et al. [3]. It essentially consists of
scanning the GC levels of chromosomes by using nonoverlapping 100 kb windows, the latter choice corresponding to the plateau values reached by the standard
deviation of GC levels of isochores belonging to different
families. A 1% GC standard deviation was accepted for
85% of the genome; a 2% GC standard deviation was
accepted for the more heterogeneous GC-rich isochores,
larger GC jumps being taken as borders between subsequent isochores.

After the completion of the present investigations, a paper
[40] reported results obtained by using a "consensus" of
four segmentation methods [41-44]. Apparently not
noticed by the authors, their "consensus" results were, in
fact, identical with our previous results on human, fish
and chicken [3,6,7], as well as with the present results on
other vertebrates. This is not surprising, because it is simply due to using our isochore boundaries and pooling all
DNA segments within those boundaries. Incidentally, the
differences between the human release hg18 used by
Schmidt and Frishman, and that, hg17, used by us (considered to be "outdated") only consisted in the elimination of very few gaps, and our "subjective decisions" on
isochore boundaries concerned a negligible number of
them. In other words, the criticisms raised by Schmidt and
Frishman, concerned two minor points that did not affect
in the least our segmentation approach nor our conclusions. While the "consensus" approach expectedly led to
isochore patterns that were identical with ours, very different results were obtained on isochore size by the four
approaches compared by Schmidt and Frishman [40]
when they were considered individually. Indeed, two of
them led to very low average sizes (40 kb, 72 kb), the
other two to very high values (~2,400 kb), the "consensus" being 100 kb. Given such differences, the utility of a
"majority rule" between such different values seems to be
highly disputable, and expectedly is in disagreement with
our estimate.

The platypus karyotype consisting of 52 chromosomes
comprised a few macro- and many micro-chromosomes,
as in the case of chicken genome [7]. Out of 1.84 gigabases (Gb) of assembled sequences, 437 megabases (Mb)
were ordered using in situ hybridization (FISH) and oriented along 19 chromosomes [45], the remaining part of
the genome being organized in ultracontigs and scaffolds
that were not assigned.
In the case of the xenopus, whose genome sequence is still
incomplete, the 19759 scaffolds for a total length of
1513.9 Mb, covering only half of the entire genome, were
retrieved from JGI (Release v.4.1, http://genome.jgipsf.org/Xentr4/Xentr4.home.html). The scaffolds were
pooled in bins of 1% GC, in order to analyze the GC profile. The same procedure was applied in the case of the
reptile Anolis carolinensis, whose genome was composed
by 2286 scaffolds and was retrieved from NCBI (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov
accession
number
AAWZ00000000).
As far as the nomenclature of each isochore was concerned, we used a convention [3,6,7] in which the first
number represented the chromosome number, the following two letters were the initials of the scientific name
of the organisms under consideration, and the last
number identified the isochore (see Additional Files 10,
11, 12, 13 and 14 Tables T1âT5).
Gene distribution
The genes from chimpanzee (Release 49.21 h), dog
(Release 49.2 g) and opossum (Release 49.5d) were
retrieved from Ensembl http://www.ensembl.org/
index.html, the mouse genes from Hovergen (Release 48,
May 2007), the platypus genes from NCBI (Release July
2007; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), and the xenopus
genes from JGI (Release v.4.1, http://genome.jgi-psf.org/
Xentr4/Xentr4.home.html). Partial, putative, synthetic
construct, predicted, not experimental, hypothetical protein, r-RNA, t-RNA, ribosomal and mitochondrial genes
were eliminated. The cleanup program [48] was then
applied, to remove redundancies from nucleotide
sequences. For the remaining genes a script implemented

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/146

by us was used in order to identify the coding sequences
beginning with a start codon and ending with a stop
codon in order to calculate reliable GC, GC1, GC2 and GC3
values (the GC levels of first, second and third codon position). Using this protocol, we obtained 4555 complete
coding sequences for chimpanzee, 4216 for dog, 17880
for mouse, 7564 for opossum, 1995 for platypus and
27713 for xenopus.
The coordinates of the genes on the chromosomes were
retrieved from the website from which the chromosomes
were downloaded. The genes were localized in the isochores and gene density was calculated, with the only
exception of xenopus, in which case genes were localized
in the available scaffolds and gene density values were
superimposed on GC profiles. In the case of anolis, the
coordinates of genes were not annotated.
Interspersed repeats of platypus and opossum
In the case of platypus and opossum, repeated sequences
were retrieved from the UCSC website http://
genome.ucsc.edu. We retrieved in the annotation database the files rmsk.txt.gz, which contain information on
the classification of repeats. In order to calculate the percentage of repeated sequences in chromosomes we
retrieved the sequences of masked chromosomes (identified by RepeatMasker and Tandem Repeat Finder).
