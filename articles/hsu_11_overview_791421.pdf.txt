Abstract
Background: Phalaenopsis orchids are popular floral crops, and development of new cultivars is economically
important to floricultural industries worldwide. Analysis of orchid genes could facilitate orchid improvement.
Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences (BESs) can provide the first glimpses into the sequence
composition of a novel genome and can yield molecular markers for use in genetic mapping and breeding.
Results: We used two BAC libraries (constructed using the BamHI and HindIII restriction enzymes) of Phalaenopsis
equestris to generate pair-end sequences from 2,920 BAC clones (71.4% and 28.6% from the BamHI and HindIII
libraries, respectively), at a success rate of 95.7%. A total of 5,535 BESs were generated, representing 4.5 Mb, or
about 0.3% of the Phalaenopsis genome. The trimmed sequences ranged from 123 to 1,397 base pairs (bp) in size,
with an average edited read length of 821 bp. When these BESs were subjected to sequence homology searches,
it was found that 641 (11.6%) were predicted to represent protein-encoding regions, whereas 1,272 (23.0%)
contained repetitive DNA. Most of the repetitive DNA sequences were gypsy- and copia-like retrotransposons
(41.9% and 12.8%, respectively), whereas only 10.8% were DNA transposons. Further, 950 potential simple sequence
repeats (SSRs) were discovered. Dinucleotides were the most abundant repeat motifs; AT/TA dimer repeats were
the most frequent SSRs, representing 253 (26.6%) of all identified SSRs. Microsynteny analysis revealed that more
BESs mapped to the whole-genome sequences of poplar than to those of grape or Arabidopsis, and even fewer
mapped to the rice genome. This work will facilitate analysis of the Phalaenopsis genome, and will help clarify
similarities and differences in genome composition between orchids and other plant species.
Conclusion: Using BES analysis, we obtained an overview of the Phalaenopsis genome in terms of gene
abundance, the presence of repetitive DNA and SSR markers, and the extent of microsynteny with other plant
species. This work provides a basis for future physical mapping of the Phalaenopsis genome and advances our
knowledge thereof.

Background
The family Orchidaceae, which contains at least 25,000
species, is one of the largest families of flowering plants
[1]. As with all other living organisms, present-day orchids have evolved from ancestral forms as a result of
selection pressure and adaptation. Orchids show a wide
diversity of epiphytic and terrestrial growth forms, and
these plants have successfully colonized almost every
habitat on earth. The factors promoting the richness of

orchid species may include specific interactions between
orchid flowers and pollinators [2], sequential and rapid
interplay between drift and natural selection [3], obligate
orchid-mycorrhizal interactions [4], and epiphytism. The
latter mode is the growth form of more than 70% of all
orchids [5], which comprise approximately two-thirds of
the epiphytic flora of the world.
Expansion of diversity may have taken place more
quickly in the orchid family than in most other flowering plant families, which had already started to diversify
in the mid-Cretaceous [6]. The time at which orchids
originated is disputed, but it has been suggested to be
80-40 million years ago (Mya) (thus in the late Cretaceous to late Eocene) [7]. Recently, the Orchidaceae were

dated using an amber fossil of an orchid pollinia on the
back of the pollinator, a stingless bee [8]. The most
recent common ancestor of extant orchids is believed to
have lived in the late Cretaceous (76-84 Mya) [8]. Perhaps the only general statement that can be made about
the origin of orchids is that most extant groups are
probably very young.
Orchids are known for the diversity of their specialized reproductive and ecological strategies. Formation
of the labellum and gynostemium (a fused structure of
the androecium and gynoecium) to facilitate pollination
has been thoroughly documented, and the co-evolution
of orchid flowers and pollinators thereof is well understood [9,10]. The successful evolutionary progress of
orchids may be explained by the packaging of mature
pollen grains as pollinia, the pollination-based regulation
of ovary/ovule development, the synchronized timing of
micro- and mega-gametogenesis for effective fertilization, and the release of thousands or millions of immature embryos (endosperm-free seeds) in a mature
capsule [11]. However, despite the unique aspects of
developmental reproductive biology and the specialized
pollination and ecological strategies of orchids, relatively
few molecular studies have focused on orchids compared to other species-rich plant families [12].
The genomic sequence resources for orchids are limited. A number of studies have used Sanger sequencing
to develop expressed sequence tag (EST) resources for
orchids [13-15]. These works have highlighted the usefulness of cDNA sequencing in the discovery of candidate genes for orchid floral development [16,17], floral
scent production [14,18], and flowering time determination [19], in the absence of a full genomic sequence.
However, we do not yet have a comprehensive description of all genes that are expressed in orchids.
Hybrids of the genus Phalaenopsis are among the toptraded blooming potted plants worldwide. Because the
plants possess favorable commercial traits, such as
numerous spikes and branches, along with many colorful
flowers, P. equestris is often used as a parent for breeding
in its native Taiwan. P. equestris is a diploid plant with 38
chromosomes (2n = 2x) that are small and uniform in
size (< 2 μm long) [20]. The plant has an estimated haploid genome size of 1,600 Mb (3.37 pg/diploid genome),
which is relatively small compared to those of other
members of the genus Phalaenopsis [21]. Public databases of floral bud ESTs from P. equestris and P. bellina
have been developed and analyzed [14,17]; they provide
valuable opportunities for researchers to directly access
genes of interest [16-18] and to identify molecular markers useful in marker-assisted breeding programs or cultivar identification (unpublished data). However, we still
lack basic information on the sequence, organization, and
structure of the Phalaenopsis genome.

One efficient and viable strategy for gaining insight into
the sequence content and complexity of the Phalaenopsis
genome is afforded by the construction of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries and end-sequencing of
randomly selected BAC clones. Such BAC end sequences
(BESs) can be used as a primary scaffold for genome
shotgun-sequence assembly and to generate comparative
physical maps [22]. Analysis of BES data can provide an
overview of the sequence composition of a novel genome,
yielding information on gene density, and the presence of
potential transposable elements (TEs) and microsatellites
[23-26]. In addition, BESs can identify molecular markers
that may be used for genomic mapping and cloning, and
in phylogenetic analysis. Even for the rice genome, which
has been fully sequenced, the Oryza Map Alignment
Project (OMAP) constructed deep-coverage large-insert
BAC libraries from 11 wild and 1 cultivated African
Oryza species (O. glaberrima); clones from these 12 BAC
libraries were next fingerprinted and end-sequenced. The
resulting data were used to construct physical maps of
the Oryza species to permit studies on evolution, genome
organization, domestication, gene regulatory networks,
and efforts toward crop improvement [27,28]. However,
such work has not yet been performed in orchids.
In the present study, we analyzed 5,535 BESs of two
genomic BAC libraries of P. equestris, focusing on simple sequence repeat (SSR) or microsatellite content,
repeat element composition, GC content, and proteinencoding regions. The annotated BESs reported herein
offer the first detailed insights into the sequence composition of the P. equestris genome, and should be a useful
resource for future molecular marker development.

Results and Discussion
BAC end sequencing

Two large-insert bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)
libraries were used for end-sequencing in the present
study. One library, constructed from a partial HindIII
digest of P. equestris genomic DNA, consisted of
100,992 clones with an average insert size of 100 kb.
The other library, constructed from a partial BamHI
digest, consisted of 33,428 clones with an average insert
size of 111 kb. The two libraries represent approximately 8.4 equivalents of the wild-type Phalaenopsis
haploid genome.
DNA samples extracted from 2,920 BAC clones
(71.4% and 28.6% from the BamHI and HindIII libraries,
respectively) were sequenced from both ends using
Applied Biosystems (ABI) Big Dye terminator chemistry
followed by analysis on ABI 3730 machines. The success
rate was 95.7%. After ambiguous, vector, and mitochondrial DNA sequences were omitted, 5,535 high-quality
BESs remained; these included 5,360 paired-end reads
(Table 1). The BESs ranged in size from 123 to 1,397 bp

(average, 821 bp) and corresponded to a total length of
4,544,250 bp, which is equivalent to 0.3% of the P. equestris genome (Table 1). The 5,535 BESs could be
assembled into 340 contigs (average coverage = 2.99) and
4,518 singletons (data not shown). In terms of readlength distribution, 800-899 bp and 900-999 bp were the
most abundant categories, accounting for 1,567 (28%)
and 1,684 (30%) of all BESs, respectively (Figure 1). The
GC content was 35.95%; this is comparable to the 34.09%
previously estimated by buoyant density analysis of the
genomic DNA of P. amabilis BLUME (Sarcanthinae;
Vandeae) [29], indicating that the Phalaenopsis genome
is AT-rich. Buoyant density analysis has also been used
to study Brassica maculate R. BR. (Oncidiinae, Vandeae),
Cattleya schombocattleya LINDL. (Epidendrinae, Epidendrae), and Cymbidium pumilum SWARTZ cv. “Gareth
Latangor” (Cymbidiinae, Vandeae), which had GC contents of 32.05%, 34.09%, and 32.05%, respectively [29].

artificial chromosome (BAC) end sequences. The trimmed
sequences ranged from 123 to 1,397 bp in length and had an
average edited read length of 821 bp.

Database sequence searches

The P. equestris BESs were subjected to sequence
homology analysis using the RepBase and TIGR plant
repeat databases, and RepeatMasker and BLAST were
employed to predict repeat sequences and potential TEs,
respectively. A total of 1,272 BESs (23.0% of total) were
found to harbor putative TEs and repeats. The BESs
were also RepeatMasked and compared to data in the
NCBI non-redundant protein databases. A total of 641
(11.6%) were found to contain protein-coding sequences;
of these, 29 BESs (0.5% of the total) contained putative
chloroplast DNA-encoded genes (Table 1).
Analysis of repetitive DNA in the BESs

The large genome size of P. equestris (1,600 kb)
implies that the content of repetitive DNA could be
high, rendering the genome more similar to that of
maize than rice. The 29 BESs containing apparent
chloroplast sequences were removed from analysis, and
the remaining 5,506 BESs were screened for repetitive
DNA sequences, using RepeatMasker and the TIGR
plant repeat database. As for other eukaryotic genomes, that of Phalaenopsis was found to contain a significant proportion of repeat sequences and potential
TEs; 1,272 BESs (23% of the total) contained such TEs
(Table 1). This percentage was higher than that of
apple (20.9%) [25], but lower than that of Citrus
clementina (25.4%) [30], carrot (28.3%) [26], or Musa
acuminata (36.6%) [24].
Among the 1,272 BESs containing potential TEs, more
showed sequence homology to Class I retrotransposons
(963 BESs, 75.7%) than to Class II DNA transposons
(137 BESs, 10.8%), suggesting a ~7:1 Class I:Class II
ratio in the genome (Table 2). The Class I retrotransposons could be further classified into Ty1/copia (163,
12.8%) and Ty3/gypsy (533, 41.9%) long-terminal-repeat
(LTR) retrotransposons; LINE (95, 7.5%) and SINE
(0, 0.0%) non-LTR retrotransposons; and other unclassified retrotransposons (172, 13.5%) (Table 2). Clearly, the
LTR retrotransposons outnumbered those of the nonLTR form (696, 54.7% vs. 95, 7.5%); the number of
unclassified retrotransposons (172, 13.5%). The next
most abundant DNA repeat type was Class II DNA
transposons, which included Ac/Ds (12, 0.9%), En/Spm
(67, 5.3%), Mutator (15, 1.2%), Tourist, Harbinger, Helitron, Mariner (10, 0.8%), and other unclassified transposons (33, 2.6%). In total, 1,100 BESs were found to
contain Class I retrotransposons and Class II DNA
transposons. The other identified repeat sequences

(19, 1.5%), ribosomal RNA genes (33, 2.6%), and other
unclassified repeat sequences (118, 9.3%). In total, such
DNA was included in 172 BESs (13.4% of those harboring repetitive sequences) (Table 2).
Functional annotation

To identify protein-encoding regions, comparison of
RepeatMasked BESs with the NCBI non-redundant protein databases revealed that 641 sequences (11.6%) contained apparent protein-encoding DNA (Table 1). Of
these, 252 (39.3%) showed top BLAST matches search
homologies to proteins from V. vinifera, whereas 106
(16.5%) best-matched proteins of O. sativa (Figure 2).
This finding is consistent with BLAST data on orchid
floral bud ESTs, which yielded top matches to V. vinifera followed by O. sativa [12,13]. At first glance, it
seems very odd that orchid genes appear to be more
highly related to a phylogenetically distant dicot species
than to another monocot. Accumulation of additional
orchid sequence data is needed to clarify this point.
BLASTN was used to compare the 641 BESs containing protein-encoding sequences to the sequences contained in our orchid EST databases [12,13]. We found
that 417 BESs (65.1%) yielded matches and are known
to be expressed in orchids (data not shown), whereas
224 (34.9%) did not show sequence matches when compared with the orchid EST databases.

Based on the fact that 641 predicted protein-encoding
sequences covered 4,544 kb of the Phalaenopsis genome,
as identified from 5,535 BESs, gene density analysis predicted that a gene should occur in every 7.1 kb of the
Phalaenopsis genome. By comparison, banana (M. acuminata) has a gene density of 6.4 kb [24], rice (O.
sativa) is predicted to have a gene every 6.2 kb [31],
whereas A. thaliana is thought to have a gene every 4.5
kb [32].
The 641 BES-derived sequences showing homology to
proteins in the NCBI non-redundant protein database
were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, and
divided into three categories: cellular components (321
BESs), molecular functions (182 BESs), and biological
processes (329 BESs). Among the 321 BESs in the cellular components category, 30 (9.35%) corresponded to
chloroplast proteins, 25 (7.79%) to membrane proteins,
and 18 (5.61%) to other cellular components. However,
more than half of these BESs (179, 55.76%) encoded
unknown cellular component proteins (Figure 3a).
Sequences in the molecular functions category were distributed as follows: 16.48% (30 BESs) of unknown molecular function, 15.38% (28) with transferase activities,
14.84% (27) with other enzymatic activities, and 14.29%
(26) with involvement in nucleotide binding (Figure 3b).
Among the 329 BESs in the biological processes category, more than half corresponded to proteins involved
in unknown biological processes (179 BESs, 54.41%),
whereas the rest were associated with other cellular processes (37, 11.25%), protein metabolism (17, 5.17%), or
transport functions (17, 5.17%) (Figure 3c).
BLASTX (E-values < 1e-5) was used to compare the
RepeatMasked BESs to the protein databases of
O. sativa (downloaded from the Rice Annotation Project
Database, http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/download/index.
html) and V. vinifera (downloaded from the NCBI
V. vinifera protein database, ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/

genomes/Vitis_vinifera/protein/). Of the 5,506 BESs, 550
(9.99%) were homologous to V. vinifera proteins. Thus,
based on an estimated genome size of 1,600 Mb for P.
equestris, it may be predicted that the total coding
sequences of the P. equestris genome might represent

approximately 159.8 Mb. If an average gene length of
3.4 kb, as in V. vinifera [33], is assumed, an estimate of
the total gene content of the P. equestris genome is
47,007. When the rice genome was used for comparison,
504 Phalaenopsis BESs showed matches to the rice

protein database, accounting for 9.15% of rice proteins.
Similar estimations indicate that protein-encoding
sequences cover 146.5 Mb of the Phalaenopsis genome
and, assuming an average gene length of 2.7 kb in
Oryza [34], predict that the Phalaenopsis genome contains 54,259 genes. These values are comparable to the
30,434 protein-encoding genes identified in the 487-Mb
grape genome [33] and the 37,544 protein-encoding
genes found in the 389-Mb rice genome [34]. Notably,
gene distribution is fairly homogeneous along the chromosomes of rice and Arabidopsis, but genes are distributed more heterogeneously in V. vinifera. Pachytene
karyotyping analyses of the P. equestris genome showed
that the distribution of heterochromatin was pericentromeric, suggesting that genes of the Phalaenopsis orchids
are more homogeneously distributed (personal communication, Dr. S. B. Chang, Department of Life Sciences,
National Cheng Kung University, Taiwan). Based on the
genome size of Phalaenopsis, we believe that both average gene length and gene distribution may be similar to
those of the rice genome, and that approximately 54,259
heterogeneously distributed genes may be present.

We identified 950 SSRs or microsatellites accounting for
17.2% of the obtained BESs (Table 1), and containing
various repeat types (Table 3). BESs from Arabidopsis
thaliana, Brassica napus, M. acuminata, O. sativa,
V. vinifera, and Zea mays were downloaded and analyzed in parallel with those of P. equestris. Dinucleotide
repeats, which are the most abundant repeat type in
M. acuminata (47.7%), B. napus (36.2%), and V. vinifera
(28.0%), were also the most common in the P. equestris
genome, accounting for 34.37% of all SSRs. The next
most common repeat type in P. equestris was mononucleotide in nature (29.9%) (Table 4). In addition, pentaand tri-nucleotide repeats accounted for 13.5% and
11.0%, respectively, of all SSRs in the P. equestris genome (Table 4). Among the mononucleotide repeats, far
more A/T repeats (264 SSRs, 93%) than G/C repeats
(20, 7%) (Table 3) were evident. Among the dinucleotide
repeats, AT/TA was the most abundant (253, 77.6%),
followed by AG/CT (47, 14.4%), AC/GT (24, 7.4%), and
CG/GC (2, 0.6%) (Table 3). The average distance
between SSRs was estimated to be 4.8 kb. Interestingly,
this is the highest SSR frequency seen among plant genomes analyzed to date, including those of Arabidopsis,
rapeseed (B. napus), banana (M. acuminata), rice, grape,
and maize, which are estimated to have an average of
6.4, 9.2, 6.2, 9, 5.8, and 16.1 kb, respectively, between
SSRs (Table 4). In P. equestris, grape, B. napus, and
banana, dinucleotides were found to be the most abundant motifs, whereas trinucleotide SSRs predominated
in rice and maize. A. thaliana was particularly rich in

mononucleotide repeats. We noted some among-study
variations in reported frequencies [24,26]; these appear
to be mainly attributable to the use of different criteria
for identifying SSRs. However, we can generally
conclude that P. equestris and dicot plants such as
grapevine, B. napus, and A. thaliana contain a high proportion of AT-rich motifs. The greatest repeat number
(275) identified to date is found in the orchid genome
(this study), whereas other monocots, such as O. sativa
and Z. mays, appear to contain lower proportions of
AT-rich motifs (Figure 4).

SSR markers have been widely used for genotyping of
crop plant species [35,36]. Of the 950 detected SSRs, we
chose 206 for use in primer design (Additional file 1),
and subsequently assessed whether the primers could
successfully distinguish 12 Phalaenopsis species, based
on allelic polymorphisms. More than 85% of primer
pairs successfully amplified products from at least 1 of
the 12 tested Phalaenopsis species, all of which have
been extensively used as parents in breeding programs
(Additional file 2). The cross-species transferability rate
of the tested SSRs ranged from 76.1- 54.8% (Additional
file 2), and most primer pairs produced polymorphic
bands in the majority of tested Phalaenopsis species
(Additional file 3). In a future study, we will examine

the efficacy of such SSR markers for genotyping of commercial orchid cultivars.
Comparative mapping of orchid BAC ends to other plant
genomes for identification of microsynteny

To examine syntenic relationships between orchid and
other plant species, orchid BESs were BLAST-searched
against the whole-genome sequences of A. thaliana, rice
(O. sativa), poplar (Populus trichocarpa), and grape
(V. vinifera). BAC end pairs of appropriate orientation
and no more than 50-300 apart on any given chromosome were considered to be potentially collinear with
the target genome. Our results revealed that 142 Phalaenopsis BESs, including 14 end-pair sequences, yielded

hits in the poplar genome. Twelve pairings mapped
together on various chromosomes, but only 1 such pair
was found within 50-300 kb of another, suggesting colinearity (Table 5). The next greatest number of hits was
obtained when the grape genome was compared with
that of our BESs; significant hits were obtained for 123
BESs, including 12 BAC end-pairs, 10 of which mapped
together on various chromosomes. One of the 10 BAC
end-pairs was found on different contigs of the same
chromosome; presumably these contigs are mutually
close, maybe even within 50-300 kb (Table 5). Ninetyfour orchid BESs, including 12 paired ends, showed significant hits to the Arabidopsis genome. Eleven of the
BAC end-pairs colocalized on various chromosomes, but
none were less than 50-300 kb apart (Table 5). The
mapping of orchid BESs to the genome of rice produced
83 BES hits, including six paired ends that colocalized
on various chromosomes, but were not within 50-300
kb of each other (Table 5).
The simple Monte Carlo Test [37] was used to assess
the statistical significance of the microsynteny results.
The sequences of each Phalaenopsis BES were randomly
shuffled 100 times to obtain 550,600 simulated
sequences, which were next BLASTN- compared to the
genomic sequences of poplar, grape, rice, and Arabidopsis. None of the simulated sequences mapped to the
genomes of the various plants, suggesting that our
results with respect to microsynteny mapping of orchid
BESs onto other plant genomes are meaningful.
Most paired ends that mapped together on plant chromosomes were annotated as ribosomal DNA (rDNA);
these sequences accounted for 10 of 14 end-pairs in
poplar, 10 of 12 in grape and Arabidopsis, and all
6 end-pairs of rice. In addition, all end-pairs that contained rDNA mapped to a single chromosome in each
plant species.
Twenty-nine orchid BESs containing Phalaenopsis
chloroplast genome sequences showed matches with
genomic sequences of the four plant genomes: 25 BESs
with the grape genome, 24 with the rice genome, 21
with the poplar genome, and 2 with the Arabidopsis

genome (Table 6; assessed using BLASTN with an
E-value <1e-30). Moreover, such BESs also showed
matches within chloroplast DNA sequences from the
four plant genomes: 28 with the grape genome, 24 with
rice, 27 with poplar, and 25 with Arabidopsis (E-value
<1e-30). Transfer of chloroplast DNA to the nucleus is
well-known to result in insertion of chloroplast DNA
into nuclear chromosomes. In rice, 421-453 chloroplast
insertions have been identified throughout the 12 chromosomes, forming 0.18-0.19% of the rice nuclear genome [34]. In the present work, the 29 orchid BESs
containing Phalaenopsis chloroplast DNA included 12
paired and 5 unpaired BES end sequences. This suggests
that at least some of these BESs may be located in the
Phalaenopsis nuclear genome, rather than representing
experimental contamination with chloroplast DNA.
Previous reports found negligible colinearity between
onion (Asparagales) and rice (Poales) [38,39]. The Asparagales include a number of economically important
plants, such as asparagus, chives, garlic, leeks, onions,
and orchids. Similarly, the well-documented high-level
synteny among grass genomes is not found among members of other monocot orders [e.g., Musa (Zingiberales)],
even though microsynteny persisted beyond the time of
divergence of the Commelinid orders Poales and Zingiberales [40]. In the present work, we failed to find any
syntenic relationship between orchid and rice sequences,
confirming the previously noted lack of synteny between
Asparagales and Poales.
Whole-genome duplication, resulting in polyploidy,
occurred in early monocots such as the Poales and Zingiberales [40,41]. Duplication, and gene loss and rearrangements occurring after such whole-genome duplication,
led to subsequent evolution and increases in morphological complexity. This may also have occurred in the orchid
genome, as suggested by the presence of the four
AP3-like paralogs that form the basis for the complicated
floral morphologies of Phalaenopsis [16]. Interestingly,
these paralogs are present in at least four out of the five
subfamilies of the Orchidaceae [42]. Future wholegenome sequencing of Phalaenopsis should provide
additional insights into genome reorganization and help
to clarify differences in genomic composition between
orchids and other plant species.

The whole-genome sequence data of V. vinifera shows that each individual
chromosome contains several contigs. Thus, we were unable to determine the
exact distances between the BAC pair ends that mapped together on the
various chromosomes of the grape genome.

Conclusions
This analysis of Phalaenopsis BAC end sequences offers
the first insights into the composition of the Phalaenopsis genome in terms of GC content, transposable elements present, protein-encoding regions, SSRs, and
potential microsynteny between Phalaenopsis and other
plant species. The protein sequence similarities between
Phalaenopsis and grape and the potential microsynteny
between Phalaenopsis and poplar are interesting and
should be confirmed by large-scale BAC end sequencing. The present work also provides a good basis for
additional sequence analysis of Phalaenopsis BAC
libraries, and will also encourage contig fingerprinting
and physical mapping of the Phalaenopsis genome.
Methods
Orchid BAC-end sequencing

BAC clones were randomly chosen from 96-well microplates and inoculated into 96-well deep-well plates containing 1.5 ml of 2x LB medium with 12.5 μg/ml
chloramphenicol. Plates were incubated at 37°C with
continuous shaking at 100 rpm for 20-24 h. BAC-end
sequencing was performed using BigDye® Terminator v
1.1 and ABI PRISM® 3730 DNA Analyzer technologies
(Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies Corporation,
Foster City, CA). The work was performed by the
Sequencing Core Facility of the National Yang Ming
University Genome Center (YMGC, Taipei, Taiwan) and
the Arizona Genomics Institute DNA Sequencing Center (AGI, Tucson, AZ).
BESs were base-called and processed using CodonCode Aligner software (Version 2.0; CodonCode Corporation, Dedham, MA), which integrates the PHRED
program [43]. We used the default parameters of “maximize region with error rate < 0.1” to trim bases from
flanking sequences and next performed the operations
“move all sequences shorter than 25 bases to trash” and
“move all sequences with fewer than 50 Phred-20 bases
to trash.” Vector sequences were trimmed using
Sequencher V4.1 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor,
MI) with reference to the pIndigoBAC5 DNA sequence.
We next discarded all BESs < 100 bp, which yielded a
set of 5,535 BESs. These were BLASTN-searched against
the chloroplast DNA sequence of P. aphrodite subsp.
formosana (GenBank accession no. NC_007499) [44]
and the mitochondrial DNA sequence of O. sativa
(japonica) cultivar Nipponbare (accession no.
DQ167400) [45], using a stringent threshold of < 1e-50.
Analysis of repetitive sequences

BESs were analyzed for repetitive sequences using
RepeatMasker [46]. We applied the same default conditions as were employed in construction of the Arabidopsis, rice, and maize sections of the RepBase Update

Page 9 of 11

databases [47]. We next used BLASTN and TBLASTX
to search the TIGR plant repeat database (downloaded
on Sep. 5, 2009) [48] with E-values < 1e-10 and < 1e-5,
respectively. Repetitive sequences were annotated using
the RepeatMasker default setting or were classified
employing the TIGR codes for repetitive plant
sequences.
Functional annotation of Phalaenopsis BESs

The 5,506 RepeatMasked BESs were further analyzed
for protein-encoding regions via BLASTX searching
of NCBI non-redundant protein databases (E-values
< 1e-5). Protein-encoding BESs were BLASTN-searched
against our in-house orchid EST databases [12,13],
using an E-value < 1e-20. BESs containing proteinencoding regions homologous to proteins found in the
NCBI non-redundant protein databases were further
analyzed in terms of Gene Ontology (GO) annotations,
using a BLASTX search of the Arabidopsis genome
annotation database (ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/
tair/Genes/TAIR9_genome_release/; E-value < 1e-7).
Categories were assigned based on biological, functional, and molecular annotations available from GO
http://www.geneontology.org/.
SSR identification and marker development

BESs from A. thaliana, B. napus, M. acuminata, O.
sativa, V. vinifera, and Z. mays were obtained from the
Genome Survey Sequences (GSS) database of the NCBI
(downloaded on Dec. 11, 2009), and subjected to SSR
analysis using the same parameters as were employed in
our analysis of orchid BESs. SSR types (mononucleotide
to hexanucleotide) were identified using the MIcroSAtellite (MISA) tool [49]; the analysis required a minimum length of 20 bases for mononucleotide repeats and
at least 15 bases for dinucleotide-to-hexanucleotide
repeats, and allowed a maximum of an 100-nt interruption if compound repeats were encountered. Primer3
software http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/ was used for
primer design. The following parameters were
employed: (1) BESs with a minimum of eight dinucleotide, five trinucleotide, four tetranucleotide, three pentanucleotide, or three hexanucleotide repeats; or an SSR
motif length longer than 15 bp; (2) primer lengths of
18-25 nt, with 20 nt being considered optimal; and (3)
predicted PCR products of 150-350 bp. A total of 206
primer pairs (Additional file 1) were synthesized and
used to amplify genomic DNA from 12 Phalaenopsis
species: P. amabilis, P. aphrodite subsp. formosana,
P. schilleriana, P. stuartiana, P. equestris, P. sanderiana,
P. lueddemanniana, P. amboinensis, P. pulcherrima,
P. fasciata, P. venosa, and P. gigantea. Genomic DNA
was isolated from leaf samples using a BioKit Plant
Genomic DNA Purification Kit. PCR was performed

Hsu et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:3
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/11/3

using 10 ng of genomic DNA, paired primers, dNTPs,
10× buffer, and Taq polymerase, in 20-μl reaction
volumes. The PCR amplification conditions were: 94°C
for 5 min followed by 45 cycles of 94°C for 60 sec,
annealing (45-60°C) for 40 sec and 72°C for 40 sec, and
a final extension for 5 min at 72°C. PCR products were
separated on either 3% (w/v) agarose or 8% (w/v) denaturing polyacrylamide gels, which were next stained
with ethidium bromide for visualization of SSR bands.
Microsynteny between P. equestris and A. thaliana,
O. sativa, P. trichocarpa, and V. vinifera

Phalaenopsis BESs (not RepeatMasked) were compared
with the genomic sequences of A. thaliana, O. sativa,
P. trichocarpa, and V. vinifera (downloaded from the
NCBI database ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/ on Feb.
27, 2010) by means of a BLASTN search with an
E-value < 1e-10. To identify BACs from the Phalaenopsis library that showed microsynteny with the reference
genomes, as described in a previous study on Musa
[24], we searched the Phalaenopsis genomic sequence
for BESs, both ends of which showed highly significant
matches to A. thaliana, O. sativa, P. trichocarpa, or
V. vinifera sequences, and that were located 50-300 kb
apart in the Phalaenopsis genome.
The simple Monte Carlo Test [37] was used to assess
the statistical significance of microsynteny between
Phalaenopsis BESs and the genomes of A. thaliana,
O. sativa, P. trichocarpa, and V. vinifera. The sequence
of each Phalaenopsis BES was randomly shuffled 100
times to obtain 550,600 simulated sequences, which
were then compared, using BLASTN, to the Arabidopsis,
rice, poplar, and grape genomes (E-value < 1e-10).
