Abstract
Background: Asparagus acutifolius L. is a dioecious and native plant species, widely distributed in
the Mediterranean Basin. It is known for its fine flavour and could represent an important resource
for cultivation programs in desert areas. Few molecular studies have been performed on this
species. In the present paper, the ISSR technique was employed to study genetic diversity in Italian
A. acutifolius.
Results: Twenty-three primers produced a total of 228 polymorphic fragments used to evaluate
genetic variation. FST (0.4561) and Theta B (0.4776) values indicate a wide genetic variation among
the samples examined. The distance UPGMA tree grouped together the genotypes strictly
according to their geographical origin, showing that each sample is genetically structured and can
be considered a distinct population. AMOVA analysis further confirmed genetic structuring of the
populations. Population-specific fragments were also detected.
Conclusion: The results suggest that ISSR markers are useful in distinguishing the populations of
A. acutifolius according to geographical origin, and confirm the importance of genetic studies for
designing germplasm conservation strategies.

Background
The availability of a variety of DNA markers, such as
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), random
amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), simple sequence
repeat (SSR) and intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR) has
enabled researchers to investigate genetic diversity among
various plant species across natural populations [1-5].
Among these, PCR-based techniques of random multilocus analysis (RAPD, AFLP, ISSR) have been successfully

used in genotyping, genome mapping and phylogenetic
studies in horticultural crops such as strawberry [6], soybean [7], and potato [8].
Local populations of traditional cultivars provide a valuable resource for plant breeding as well as for the preservation of genetic diversity [9]. The exploration, evaluation,
and conservation in situ and ex situ of genetic diversity in
natural populations is imperative to guarantee sustainable
development [10].

Asparagus acutifolius L. (Liliaceae) is a native, perennial
plant species widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean areas, whose flowers are classified as dioecious and
are mainly bee-pollinated; it generally does not reproduce
by self-pollination. It grows in bushy and semi-dry places,
sunny or semi-shade, mainly on limestone.
This species is known for its strong taste compared to the
cultivated A. officinalis and does not require rich soils for
cultivation; for these reasons, it could be an economically
important resource for the recovery of arid rural areas
where controlled introduced programs could be achieved.

To date, there is little information available on the genetic
variability of this species. At present, the most widely studied species is A. officinalis, for which many molecular
markers have been characterized (RAPD, RFLP, AFLP)
[11]. The few molecular data regarding A. acutifolius are
drawn from RAPD analyses [12] and the identification of
microsatellite loci [13]. The ISSR technique is similar to
that for RAPD, except that ISSR primers consist of a di- or
trinucleotide simple sequence repeat with a 5' or 3'

anchoring sequence of 1–3 nucleotides. Compared with
RAPD primers, the ISSR primers sequence is usually
larger, allowing for a higher primer annealing temperature
which results in greater band reproducibiliy than RAPD
markers [14]. They have been successfully used to assess
genetic variation in plants such as citrus [15], Viola pubescens [14], potato [8], and Oryza [16].
In this study we used ISSR markers to analyse the genetic
diversity of Italian A. acutifolius collecting samples in eight
different scattered rural areas: six continental and one
each from the Italian islands of Sardinia and Sicily.

Results
Figure 1 and Table 1 show the eight different Italian sites
where A. acutifolius was collected and their characteristics.
Among the 42 primers tested, 23 proved useful to characterize the samples (Table 2), whereas 19 were excluded
due to absence of amplification (9 primers) or to amplification of the same single fragment in all samples (10
primers). The 23 useful primers gave a total of 228 polymorphic fragments, ranging from 150 to 1100 bp, with
100% repeatability. Fragments of the same molecular
weight were considered as the same locus [17]. The valid-

ity of ISSRs in assessing genetic variability in the eight
samples of Italian A. acutifolius is summarized in Table 3.
A high level of genetic variation was observed using ISSR
markers, with 100% polymorphic loci at the species level.
The highest number of polymorphic loci (51.75%) was
exhibited in the Sassari and the lowest (35.09%) in the
Recco samples.
Genetic structuring was evident due to the detection of
specific bands in each sample examined. Spoleto and
Caserta samples showed one and three fixed specific fragments, respectively, found to be statistically significant (P
< 0.0001). For the other samples, 27 ISSR specific polymorphic fragments were detected, with a varying degree of
statistical significance ranging from P < 0.0400 to P <
0.0001.
Genetic distances [18] were examined for all pairwise
comparisons between the sub-populations (Table 4). The
mean distance for all comparisons was 0.1680, ranging
from 0.0916 (between Isernia and Lecce) and 0.2865
(between Recco and Caserta). The Mantel test showed no
correlation between the genetic and geographic data (0.220).
Samples collected at different geographic site grouped
together, as shown in the UPGMA tree (Fig. 2), and the
AMOVA analysis revealed significant genetic structuring
(p = 0.001).
The values of gene diversity are summarized in Table 3a.
For some primers, the value was 0.0000, and the highest
value (0.3503) was found for the primer W814 in the Catania sample. This explains the high standard deviation
values observed.
As summarized in Table 3b, the total variation (HT) was
0.2618 ± 0.0240 and the average variation within samples
(average HS) was 0.1424 ± 0.0084. The mean diversity
among the samples (DST) was 0.1194. The fixation index

FST = (HT-HS)/HT was 0.4561, indicating a reduction of
genetic diversity of about 45%. The Theta-B value
obtained by Hickory analysis is an estimate of FST under a
random-effects model of population sampling. Its mean
value is 0.4766 ± 0.0173; the HT and HS values are, respectively, 0.2859 ± 0.0115 and 0.1619 ± 0.0026 showing that
there is a general agreement between the results obtained
using the two different approaches.

Discussion
ISSR markers can be used in population genetic studies of
plant species as they effectively detect very low levels of
genetic variation [19]. They also may have potential for
analysing biogeographic patterns among populations of a
single plant species. In this study, we have shown that
these markers revealed genetic variation among geographically separated samples of A. acutifolius in an Italian population. ISSRs also revealed diversity within each subpopulation. The results obtained are in accordance with
the principle that the number of individuals used to estimate average heterozygosity can be very small if a large
number of loci is studied [18].
The gene diversity values (Table 3a) ranged from 0.0525
(TE-Recco) to 0.3503 (W814-Catania). As expected, some
primer-sample combinations showed no diversity (0.0)
for two reasons: i) the combination primer-sample produced the same amplification pattern in all the samples
(primer 4, Livorno and Recco; primer 8, Recco; primer
W814, Livorno and Recco); ii) the combination primersample produced no measurable fragments (primer 8564,
Catania; primer W844, Lecce and Livorno). These primers
were not excluded from the analysis because in some cases
they produced sample-specific fragments (e.g.: primer
8564 in Caserta and Lecce; W844 in Catania and Recco;
primer 8 in Caserta, Catania, Isernia, Sassari, and
Spoleto).
The fixation index is 0.4561, which indicates a substantial
reduction of genetic diversity (about 45%), probably due
to the high genetic isolation of samples analysed. The FST

and the Theta-B value (0.4766) demonstrated a very great
genetic differentiation among samples, possibly caused by
random genetic drift. Further statistical support to the
genetic structuring of the samples examined comes from
the AMOVA analysis. Despite the continuous distribution
of A. acutifolius, the eight samples represent genetically
differentiated populations.
In each population it was possible to identify ISSR specific
fragments. As shown in Table 3a, the Caserta and Spoleto
populations had specific fixed fragments that distinguished them from all others. Although the Isernia specific fragments are not statistically significant (P > 0.05),
population-specific fragments were detected for all the
other populations, with varying levels of intra-population
polymorphism, ranging from 0.147 to 0.764. Thus, we
have identified reproducible markers that distinguish the
geographical origin of the A. acutifolius populations.
The high degree of genetic differentiation is confirmed by
the UPGMA tree topology, in which all accessions from
the same population grouped together (Fig. 2). The populations showed genetic distances ranging from 0.0916 and
0.1821 with the exception of the Caserta population that
is more distant from the others (from 0.2421 with Catania
to 0.2865 with Recco, Table 4). This result is probably due
to the high number of specific ISSR fragments found in
the Caserta population (12, including monomorphic and
polymorphic) and can be attributed to genetic drift. In
particular, the high distance between Caserta and Isernia
(0.2573) is unexpected because of the short geographical
distance separating the regions, and could explain the
absence of correlation between genetic and geographical
data matrices obtained with the Mantel test. The high
genetic structuring of the eight populations shows that
despite the continuous distribution of A. acutifolius
throughout the Italian peninsula, there is poor gene flow
through the isolates. The high genetic differentiation of
the A. acutifolius populations examined might be attributed to the kind of pollinators (mainly bees) that can act
at short distances, preventing the gene flow, and to the
effects of anthropogenic habitat fragmentation.
The results obtained using ISSR markers are in agreement
with the RAPD analysis that also identified populationspecific fragments in different Italian A. acutifolius populations [12].

Conclusion
Information about the spatial organization of genetic variability is essential for the conservation of genetic
resources [20]. Our results provide an important contribution toward confirming that A. acutifolius has well-differentiated populations, despite their morphological low
variability. These results show that to maintain genetic

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2156/6/17

diversity within A. acutifolius it is necessary to conserve
many populations.

Methods
Plant materials
A total of 109 samples of A. acutifolius collected in the
eight different locations in Italy (listed in Table 1 and
showed in Fig. 1) were used for the analysis. Although
they are only a tiny fraction of the A. acutifolius Mediterranean distribution, they are representative of the Italian
population.
ISSR amplification
DNA was extracted from silica gel dried cladodes following the Doyle and Doyle protocol [21].

A total of 42 ISSR primers were tested on the eight populations of A. acutifolius. The polymerase chain reaction was
conducted in a 9600 Perkin Elmer Thermal Cycler using
the following reaction conditions: 2–5 ng DNA, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 0.6 µM primer, 1.5 UE Taq
polymerase (BIOLINE) and 1X Taq DNA polymerase
buffer, in a total volume of 25 µL. The amplification programme was 1.5 min at 94°C; 35 × 40 s at 94°C, 45 s at
the primer annealing optimal temperature (see Table 2),
1.5 min at 72°C; 45 s at 94°C, 45 s at the annealing temperature, 5 min at 72°C.
Following PCR, the samples were loaded onto a 1.5% agarose gel in TAE 1X buffer, stained with ethidium bromide.
Additionally, 100 bp ladder (Promega) and negative and
positive controls were loaded and run at constant voltage
(150 V) for 2 hours. After running, the gels were UV visualised and recorded using a Kodak Digital Science dS1D
DC40/DC120 Camera. To verify the repeatability of the
results, each DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and gel
running was repeated twice.
Data analysis
Unequivocally scorable and consistently reproducible
amplified DNA fragments were transformed into binary
character matrix (1 = presence, 0 = absence).

Genetic variation within and among sub-populations was
analysed on the basis of the banding profile using various
parameters such as percentage polymorphism (P), total
heterozygosity (HT), heterozygosity within population
(HS), diversity among populations (DST), fixation index
(FST), and genetic distance [18,22-24], using POPGENE
software [25]. Since ISSR are dominant markers, data were
also analysed using Hickory software [26] based on a
Bayesian method that does not require prior decisions
about the breeding system and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; the analysis was conducted under the f-free model.

AMOVA analysis, implemented in Arlequin [27], was conducted to document the degree of genetic structure among
sub-populations.

The Mantel test of genetic and geographic distances was
carried out to evaluate the correlation between the two
data matrices.
The UPGMA tree was generated using the PAUP*4.0 software [28], and Bootstrap analysis was conducted using
1000 replicates.
