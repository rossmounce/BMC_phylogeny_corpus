Abstract
Background: Strains of viridans group streptococci that initiate colonization of the human tooth
surface typically coaggregate with each other and with Actinomyces naeslundii, another member of
the developing biofilm community. These interactions generally involve adhesin-mediated
recognition of streptococcal receptor polysaccharides (RPS). The objective of our studies is to
understand the role of these polysaccharides in oral biofilm development.
Methods: Different structural types of RPS have been characterized by their reactions with
specific antibodies and lectin-like adhesins. Streptococcal gene clusters for RPS biosynthesis were
identified, sequenced, characterized and compared. RPS-producing bacteria were detected in
biofilm samples using specific antibodies and gene probes.
Results: Six different types of RPS have been identified from representative viridans group
streptococci that coaggregate with A. naeslundii. Each type is composed of a different hexa- or
heptasaccharide repeating unit, the structures of which contain host-like motifs, either GalNAcβ13Gal or Galβ1-3GalNAc. These motifs account for RPS-mediated recognition, whereas other
features of these polysaccharides are more closely associated with RPS antigenicity. The RPSdependent interaction of S. oralis with A. naeslundii promotes growth of these bacteria and biofilm
formation in flowing saliva. Type specific differences in RPS production have been noted among the
resident streptococcal floras of different individuals, raising the possibility of RPS-based differences
in the composition of oral biofilm communities.
Conclusion: The structural, functional and molecular properties of streptococcal RPS support a
recognition role of these cell surface molecules in oral biofilm formation.

Background
Colonization of the human tooth surface is initiated by a
limited number of gram-positive species, primarily viridans group streptococci [1]. These bacteria attach to host
salivary components that coat the mineral surface and,
through growth and interactions between species, form a
relatively simple biofilm community (i.e. early plaque).
Members of this community can activate host cells, and
the biofilm itself creates a habitat for additional species,
some of which are closely associated with the initiation
and progression of dental caries and periodontal disease
[2]. In the current communication we summarize evidence for the hypothesis that the surface polysaccharides
of certain viridans group streptococci are receptors for lectin-like adhesins present on other members of the developing oral biofilm community. Studies of how these
components influence biofilm development may provide
insights into the etiology and pathogenesis of biofilmrelated oral diseases.
Early Biofilm Formation Involves a Limited Number of
Microbial Species
An attractive experimental model for defining early events
in oral biofilm formation involves the incubation of
retrievable enamel chips in the human oral cavity for periods of time from 4 to 12 hrs. Scanning electron micrographs of chips removed during this period suggest that
colonization is initiated by the attachment of individual
microorganisms to the saliva-coated mineral surface and
proceeds primarily by the growth of attached bacteria as
spreading microcolonies [3]. These microcolonies typically consist of a peripheral monolayer of dividing cocci
and rods and a central region containing multiple bacterial layers. S. sanguinis, S. oralis and S. mitis were the most
prominent species identified in parallel microbiological
studies [2] and together comprised approximately 80% of
the total cultivatable flora. Gram-positive pleomophic
rods, mostly strains of Actinomyces naeslundii, made up
another 5 to 10% of the total. Thus, primary colonization
of the saliva-coated mineral surface involves the formation of a relatively simple biofilm community.

Interestingly, S. mutans, the principal agent of human
dental caries, was generally not identified from early biofilms formed on enamel chips following incubation in the
oral cavities of individuals with active caries [4]. Moreover, when this species was detected, it accounted for less
than 2% of the total early streptococcal flora. Differences
in the relative proportions of other streptococcal species
were however noted between the early flora of caries
active and caries free individuals. Specifically, the proportion of S. mitis was generally elevated at the expense of S.
sanguinis in caries active individuals. The ecological consequences of this population shift are not well understood.
However, they may include a lowering of the early plaque

pH as suggested from comparative studies of acid production by representative strains of these streptococcal species
[5]. A more acidic environment could in turn favor the
succession of aciduric species such as S. mutans, resulting
in rapid caries development. Thus, the etiology and
pathogenesis of oral disease may well be linked to ecological properties of the early biofilm community.
Structural Basis of Receptor Polysaccharide (RPS)Mediated Interbacterial Adhesion
Bacterial properties that contribute to development of the
early biofilm community may include the surface adhesins and receptors that mediate the coaggregations
observed between different strains of S. sanguinis, S. gordonii, S. oralis, S. mitis and A. naeslundii [6]. The coaggregations between A. naeslundii and different streptococci are
typically inhibited by GalNAc or Gal and result from lectin-like binding of A. naeslundii type 2 fimbriae to complementary receptors present on the streptococcal surface.
These receptors occur on most strains of S. oralis and on
certain strains of S. sanguinis, S. gordonii and S. mitis. Many
but not all streptococci that possess such receptors also participate in coaggregations with other strains of S. sanguinis
or S. gordonii. These coaggregations are inhibited by GalNAc and result from lectin-like binding of surface adhesins present on the strains of S. sanguinis or S. gordonii [7].
Thus, an extensive network of adhesive interactions occurs
among different members of the early biofilm community.

The structural basis of the coaggregations observed
between different bacteria is evident from the carbohydrate-binding specificities of the surface adhesins present
on strains of A. naeslundii, S. sanguinis and S. gordonii, and
from the structures of the complementary receptors
present on other streptococcal strains. The type 2 fimbriae
of A. naeslundii, in addition to mediating coaggregations
with streptococci, mediate the adhesion of A. naeslundii to
surface-associated host glycoconjugates [8,9]. Two different receptor structures have been identified, terminal
GalNAcβ1-3Gal of globoside and terminal Galβ13GalNAc of asialo-O-linked glycoproteins and gangliosides. Consistent with these findings, soluble GalNAcβ13Gal- and Galβ1-3GalNAc-containing ligands are potent
inhibitors of A. naeslundii type 2 fimbriae-mediated adhesion [10]. These disaccharides differ only in the position
of the N-acetyl group. Consequently, the ability of each to
inhibit binding of A. naeslundii type 2 fimbriae presumably depends on common features of these structures. The
GalNAc-binding surface adhesins of S. sanguinisSK1 and
S. gordonii DL1 also recognize terminal GalNAcβ1-3Gal
[11]. However, these adhesins do not bind terminal
Galβ1-3GalNAc of immobilized glycocongugates. In
accordance with these findings, the coaggregations
observed between strains of S. sanguinis or S. gordonii and

other streptococci are inhibited more effectively by soluble
GalNAcβ1-3Gal- than Galβ1-3GalNAc-containing ligands
[6]. Thus, the N-acetyl group of GalNAcβ1-3Gal is critical
for binding of the streptococcal adhesins that mediate
these interactions.
Structural studies of over 20 representative strains of S.
sanguinis, S. gordonii, S. oralis and S. mitis that participate
in type 2 fimbriae-mediated coaggregations with A. naeslundii have resulted in the identification of six different
streptococcal receptor polysaccharides (RPS), each composed of a distinct hexa- or heptasaccharide repeating unit
(Fig. 1) [12]. Remarkably, a host-like receptor motif for
binding of A. naeslundii type 2 fimbriae occurs within each
RPS repeating unit. Four structural types of RPS contain
GalNAcβ1-3Gal (Gn) motifs (i.e., RPS types 1Gn, 2Gn,

4Gn and 5Gn) while the other two types contain Galβ13GalNAc (G) motifs (i.e., RPS types 2G and 3G). All streptococci that bear these polysaccharides are coaggregation
partners of A. naeslundii. However, only streptococci that
bear Gn-types of RPS are coaggregation partners of S.
sanguinisSK1 and S. gordonii DL1. The GalNAc binding
adhesins of these strains do not recognize G-types of RPS.
Thus, the occurrence of Gn and G types of RPS on different streptococci may influence biofilm development.
Other features of RPS that are conserved between structural types may contribute to adhesin binding of these linear polysaccharides. Such features include the flexibility of
the β1–6 linkage from Galf and the anionic phosphodiester bond that flank each recognition motif [13,14]. This
region, although critical for interbacterial adhesion, con-

Molecular basis of type 2Gn RPS biosynthesis and structure. (A) The operon for type 2Gn RPS biosynthesis in S. gordonii 38
consists of 14 genes located between nrdG and orfO. The first four of these encode regulatory proteins. The remaining 10
genes include seven for putative glycosyltransferases, wzx and wzy for the transport and polymerization of RPS repeating units
and glf for the epimerase that supplies UDP-Galf, one of five essential RPS precursors. (B) The deduced roles of the seven glycosylytransferases encoded by the type 2Gn RPS gene cluster in synthesis of the corresponding lipid-linked heptasaccharide

tributes little to the antigenicity of different RPS structural
types. Instead, other structural features such as the Rha
branch present in types 2Gn and 2G RPS [15] form the
major epitopes of anti-RPS antibodies. Consequently, the
reactions of types 2Gn and 2G RPS are similar as antigens
but distinct as receptors. Other structural types such as
types 1Gn and 2Gn RPS react as similar receptors but different antigens. Such findings raise the possibility that the
production of different antigenic types of RPS contributes
to evasion of the host secretory immune response during
oral biofilm formation. However, the presence of specific
anti-RPS antibodies has not been detected in samples of
whole human saliva. Thus, further studies of the host

response (or the lack of a response) to these molecules are
needed.
Molecular Basis of RPS Structure and Function
Results from recent molecular studies have identified biosynthetic gene clusters for each of the six RPS structural
types. As illustrated for the type 2Gn RPS gene cluster of S.
gordonii 38 (Fig. 2) [16], the 5'-ends of each RPS cluster
contain four common regulatory genes (i.e., wzg, wzh, wzd
and wze). Homologues of these genes occur widely in
polysaccharide gene clusters of gram-positive bacteria,
including capsular polysaccharide genes clusters of S.
pneumoniae [17]. The regulatory region of each RPS gene

cluster is followed by genes for the glycosyltransferases
that synthesize the lipid-linked, type-specific RPS repeating unit. High homology exists between a number of
genes for glycoslytransferases in strains of S. gordonii and
S. oralis [18], suggesting horizontal gene transfer between
these species. Moreover, the presence or absence of specific genes is closely correlated with structural differences
that exist between different types of RPS. For example, the
Rha branch that distinguishes type 2Gn from 1Gn RPS
depends on the glycosyltransferase encoded by wefB, a
gene that is present in the type 2Gn RPS cluster of S. gordonii 38 but not in the type 1Gn RPS gene cluster of S. ora-

lis 34 [18]. Likewise, different pairs of adjacent genes, wefC
and wefD in the type 2Gn cluster of S. gordonii 38 and wefF
and wefG in the type 2G cluster of S. oralis J22, account for
the distinct recognition motifs present in the corresponding polysaccharides of these strains [19]. Additional genes
in each RPS cluster encode a putative flipase (Wzx), which
transports the oligosaccharide moiety of the lipid-linked
repeating unit to the outer surface of the cytoplasmic
membrane and a putative polymerase (Wzy), which links
repeating units end-to-end forming the linear polysaccharide chain. Polymerization involves the formation of a
glycosidic linkage between the first and last sugars of each

RPS repeat (i.e., Glcβ1-6Galf in types 1Gn, 2Gn and 2G
RPS, Glcβ1-3Galf in type 3G RPS and Galβ1-6Galf in types
4Gn and 5Gn RPS).
Additional genes control the synthesis of nucleotidelinked sugars that are essential precursors for RPS biosynthesis. One of these (glf) encodes galactofuranose mutase,
the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of UDP-Galactopyranose to UDP-Galactofuranose. This gene invariably
occurs within the RPS gene clusters of different strains.
The location of other genes for nucleotide sugar biosynthesis varies between streptococcal species. For example,
in S. gordonii 38, the first three genes of the dTDP-L-Rhamnose biosynthetic pathway (i.e., rmlA, rmlC and rmlB)
occur in a separate operon with galE2, the gene for a
bifunctional galactose epimerase that supplies both UDPGal and UDP-GalNAc for polysaccharide biosynthesis
[16]. The final gene for dTDP-L-Rhamnose biosynthesis
(i.e., rmlD) is transcribed independently, downstream of
the rml-galE2 operon. In contrast, rmlA, rmlC and rmlB of
S. oralis strains 34 and J22 occur at the 3'-end of the
respective type 1Gn and 2G RPS gene clusters of these
strains, while rmlD occurs immediately downstream but
transcribed in the opposite direction [19,18]. The differences that exist between the RPS gene clusters of S. gordonii and S. oralis, both in terms of their organization and
nucleotide sequence homologies, raise the interesting
possibility that the evolution of RPS production in these
bacteria occurred following the divergence of these species. The four RPS-producing species of oral streptococci,
S. sanguinis, S. gordonii, S. oralis and S. mitis, are closely
related members of the mitis group [20]. Members of this
group, which includes S. pneumoniae, are all intimately
associated with the oral cavity and upper respiratory tract
of man. Thus, the evolution of certain species as members
of the human oral biofilm community may be closely
linked with the evolution of RPS production. The identification of genes for RPS structure and function provides a
beginning basis for further phylogenetic studies to examine this intriguing possibility.
Role of RPS-mediated Interbacterial Adhesion in Biofilm
Development
Laser confocal microscopy performed in conjunction with
different specific antibodies has been used to examine the
distribution of RPS-bearing streptococci and type 2 fimbriated A. naeslundii in early biofilms formed in vivo on
retrievable enamel chips [21]. Bacteria labeled for cell surface RPS were seen in large numbers on chips following 8
hr incubation in vivo. Other bacteria labeled with antibodies specific for strains of A. naeslundii were also
present, but in much lower numbers. Significantly, the latter cells (i.e., type 2 fimbriated A. naeslundii) were found
almost exclusively within microcolonies of RPS-producing bacteria, thereby supporting the role of RPS-mediated

interbacterial adhesion in early biofilm formation. Moreover, A. naeslundii has been identified within spreading
monolayers of RPS-producing streptococci formed during
early in vivo colonization of the enamel surface (Fig. 3).
The ecological role of RPS-mediated interbacterial adhesion may be to promote the formation of food chains and
other mutualistic interactions that require close contact
between different bacteria. Evidence for this possibility
has been obtained using a flowcell model of biofilm formation in which human saliva is the sole source of nutrients for bacterial growth [22]. Biofilm formation was
limited or did not occur under these conditions when
either RPS-producing S. oralis 34 or type 2 fimbriated A.
naeslundii T14V were introduced separately into flowcells.
However, a luxuriant mixed-species biofilm formed when
these two strains were introduced together. These observations have recently been extended by the results of similar
experiments performed with these wild-type strains and
corresponding mutant strains that specifically lack cellsurface RPS or type 2 fimbriae. As expected, wild-type S.
oralis 34 and A. naeslundii T14V formed a luxuriant biofilm (Fig. 4). However, biofilm formation was greatly
reduced when either wild-type strain was paired with the
non-adherent mutant of the other cell type (i.e., RPS-negative S. oralis 34 or type 2 fimbriae-negative A. naeslundii
T14V). Thus, RPS-mediated interbacterial adhesion
appears to promote the establishment of a mutualistic
association between S. oralis and A. naeslundii that is
essential for luxuriant growth and mixed-species biofilm
formation in flowing human saliva.
Characterization of RPS-Producing Bacteria from
Different Individuals
The identification of six structural types of RPS is based on
the characterization of representative strains of the four
RPS-producing species. Consequently, it is unclear how
many different RPS-producing strains occur within the
streptococcal flora of any one individual. To address this
question, we have begun to characterize these bacteria
from individual volunteers. This involves the identification of RPS-producing clones from samples of 8 hr biofilms by colony immunoblotting with a cocktail of RPSspecific antibodies and the subsequent characterization of
individual clones by the reactions with specific antibodies
and adhesins. Initial results of these studies indicate the
production of one predominant type of RPS by the resident streptococcal flora of each individual examined to
date. Thus, 22 RPS-producing isolates from one volunteer
all produced type 1Gn RPS while 19 RPS-producing isolates from another individual all produced type 2Gn RPS.
In addition, 21 RPS-producing isolates from a third individual included 19 that produced type 2Gn RPS and two
that produced type 1Gn RPS. PCR-based genotyping [23]
of these isolates suggests the presence of from one to three

BMC Oral Health 2006, 6:S12

different RPS-producing clones per individual. These
clones appear to be S. oralis or S. gordonii based on
sequencing of a housekeeping gene [24]. Whether RPSproducing clones of different individuals are subject to
replacement or to chromosomal rearrangement over time
as has been described for strains of S. mitis [25] and S. oralis [26] remains to be determined.

Conclusion
Over 90% of the RPS-producing streptococci identified
from samples of early supragingival plaque from each of
five individuals are type 1Gn or 2Gn RPS producing
clones. The preponderance of these bacteria in the plaque
samples examined to date raises a number of intriguing
possibilities concerning the occurrence and distribution
of the streptococci that produce other structural types.
Clearly, one possibility is that the streptococcal floras of
certain individuals will be found to produce type 2G, 3G,
4Gn or 5Gn RPS, thereby indicating significant differences
in RPS production between individuals. Alternatively, the
RPS-producing flora of each individual, including those
that have been examined, may be more complex than is
presently recognized. If so, streptococci that produce structural types other than type 1Gn or 2Gn RPS may emerge
as the early biofilm community matures or perhaps
appear during the colonization of other oral sites. In any
case, it will be important to determine whether RPS-producing streptococci, especially those that produce Gn- and
G-types, exist within distinct biofilm communities. The
existence of RPS-based differences in the composition of
biofilm communities would firmly establish the recognition role of these polysaccharides in biofilm development
and could provide important new insights into the etiology and pathogenesis of biofilm-related oral diseases,
including dental caries.

Another intriguing area of investigation involves the natural history of RPS-producing streptococci in the human
host. Available findings indicate that these bacteria are
transmitted from adults to infants shortly after tooth eruption. It is unclear, however, whether the resident RPS-producing streptococcal flora, once acquired, is stable, or
whether changes in the population of RPS-producing
clones occur over the lifetime of each individual. New
structural types of RPS may evolve gradually and be disseminated by transmission between individuals. Alternatively, new types may arise frequently by the horizontal
transfer of genes for RPS biosynthesis between different
streptococcal strains and species within the resident flora
of each individual. Current molecular studies of RPS production are directed toward distinguishing these possibilities.
