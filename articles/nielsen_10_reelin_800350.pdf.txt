Abstract
Background: Reelin is an extracellular glycoprotein of crucial importance in the developmental organisation of
neurons in the mammalian cerebral cortex and other laminated brain regions. The pig possesses a gyrencephalic brain
that bears resemblance to the human brain. In order to establish an animal model for neuronal migration disorders in
the pig, we have studied the expression pattern and structure of Reelin during pig brain development.
Results: We determined the sequence of pig Reelin mRNA and protein and identified a high degree of homology to
human Reelin. A peak in Reelin mRNA and protein expression is present during the period of major neurogenesis and
neuronal migration. This resembles observations for human brain development. Immunohistochemical analysis
showed the highest expression of Reelin in the Cajal-Reztius cells of the marginal zone, in resemblance with
observations for the developing brain in humans and other mammalian species.
Conclusions: We conclude that the pig might serve as an alternative animal model to study Reelin functions and that
manipulation of the pig Reelin could allow the establishment of an animal model for human neuronal migration
disorders.
Background
The mature cerebral cortex of higher mammals consists
of a six-layered structure with each layer comprising different types of neurons that perform distinct functions.
The layered structure is created during development by
migration of young post-mitotic neurons along glial
fibers from the proliferative zones lining the ventricles to
the outer layers of the developing cortical plate (CP). The
post-mitotic neurons follow an ordered inside-out pattern of migration were young neurons migrate past their
predecessors to their correct position in more superficial
layers of the CP [1,2]. Proper cortical layering calls for
highly synchronized processes of neuronal genesis,
migration and maturation. The mechanisms controlling
the whole-cell movement are well understood, but knowledge of how the neurons are instructed to leave their glial
guidance upon reaching their destination remains
unclear.

Genetic studies of human malformation and mutant
mice with deficient neuronal migration have played an
integral role in unveiling the existence of signalling pathways that regulate neuronal migration and neuronal
detachment from the glial fibers [3,4]. The Reelin pathway is one of the most intensively studied pathways
involved in neuronal migration. Mutations in the Reelin
gene is associated with neuroanatomic abnormalities in
reeler mice [5,6] and causes recessive lissencephaly with
cerebellar hypoplasia in humans [7,8]. The reeler phenotype is characterized by disordered cellular positioning of
neurons in the major laminated structures of the brain,
including the cerebral and cerebellar cortices and hippocampus [4,5,9,10]. The post-mitotic neurons derived
from the radial progenitors in the subventricular zone
begin their migration at the normal developmental stage
and proceed as far as the intermediate zone. The newborn neurons, however, fail to split the preplate and the
subsequently generated neurons accumulate underneath
the previously generated neurons, forming a scattered
neuron distribution with an approximately inverted cortical plate (outside-in) [5,10,11].

Reelin is a large extracellular glycoprotein known to
influence migrating neurons as an initiator of a pathway
that mediates a signal from the extracellular matrix. The
signal transduction is accomplished through direct binding to the ectodomains of the lipoprotein receptors Very
Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor (VLDLR) and Apolipoprotein Receptor 2 (ApoER2) [12,13] upon binding to
the receptors a rapid phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic
adapter protein Disabled-1 (Dab1) is induced by members of the Src family tyrosine kinases [14-18]. Dab1
phosphorylation is succeeded by cytoskeletal rearrangements [17,18]. Cytoskeletal rearrangements are accomplished
through
direct
interactions
between
phosphorylated Dab1 and a variety of proteins involved
in actin remodeling such as neuronal Wiskott-Aldrich
syndrome protein and Rap-GTP and Lissencephaly-1,
nuclear distribution gene E homolog like 1, Tau, and
microtubule-associated protein 1B in microtubule reorganization [12,19-21]. Mutations in mouse Reelin,
ApoER2 and VLDLR (double receptor mutant) or Dab1
result in highly similar phenotypes with the inability of
neurons to split the preplate and inability of glial-guided
neurons to bypass their predecessors [19,22]. The mechanism by which the Reelin pathway facilitates correct neuronal positioning remains unclear although Reelin has
been suggested to control detachment of migrating neurons from radial-glial cells [23,24]. Recent data indicate
that another function of Reelin could be to activate Notch
[25]. Interaction between phosphorylated Dab1 and the
activated form of Notch (Notch intracellular domain;
NICD) inhibits polyubiquitination and degradation of
NICD, which is expected to strengthen Notch signaling
[25,26].
Expression analysis of Reelin during development has
been studied in a wide range of animals spanning from
reptiles over birds to mammals including mice and
human [27-32]. These studies indicate that the Reelinexpressing cells are conserved through evolution and
Reelin has played a critical role in cortical evolution. In
mammals, Reelin has the highest expression in Cajal-Retzius (CR) cells during neocortical development
[5,6,10,30,33,34]. CR cells appear early in development
and constitute the majority of the neurons in the marginal zone (MZ) [35] but they are transient neurons and
disappear between postnatal week 2 and 3 in rodents and
around gestational week 27 in humans [36,37]. In
humans, CR cells have characteristic morphological
appearance with a rich axonal arborization orientated
horizontally [32,38]. In rodents, CR cells have a more uniform morphology and can be identified based on three
morphologic criteria: 1) usually bipolar with 2) horizontal
orientation and 3) fusiform or ovoid shape [37,39]. In
pigs, CR cells resemble other mammalian CR with
respect to localization in the outer part of MZ, orienta-

tion parallel to the pial surface, and bipolar and fusiform
somata [40,41].
The domestic pig has emerged as an attractive non-primate animal model for studies of brain development, due
to the similarity between human and pig embryonic
brains [42]. The gyrencephalic pig brain bears resemblance to the human brain with respect to gross anatomy,
cytoarchitecture, size and development rather than to the
brains from small rodent laboratory animals [42]. In this
study we have identified and characterized pig Reelin and
determined the expression pattern of Reelin during
embryonic cortical development in this species.

Results and Discussion
Sequence of the pig Reelin mRNA and protein

As a first step towards characterization of pig Reelin we
determined the sequence of mRNA and protein. As the
pig genome sequence is not available, the Reelin mRNA
sequence was assembled from combined in silico and RTPCR analysis. A 11,694 bp mRNA sequence was determined including an open reading frame from position
283 to 10,665 with potential to encode a protein consisting of 3460 amino acids [Genebank accession no.
BK006770]. The deduced molecular weight of the pig
Reelin protein is 388 kD, not taking into account post
translational modifications such as glycosylation. Protein
alignment to human Reelin showed 96% identity and 98%
similarity. Notably, no gaps were introduced in the alignment of the pig and human Reelin proteins. Protein alignment to mouse Reelin showed 94% identity and 98%
similarity with two gaps. Like the human and mouse Reelin proteins the pig Reelin includes 8 Reelin-repeats of
350-390 amino acids containing a pattern of conserved
residues related to epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats
(Figure 1A). The Reelin repeats can be divided into two
sub-repeats A and B (see Figure 1A) [43]. The C-terminal
region (CTR) of Reelin, consisting of 32 amino acids, is
highly conserved between species, and the pig Reelin
indeed includes such a completely conserved CTR.
Another characteristic of Reelin is the existence of a 27
amino acid signal peptide in the N-terminus. Protein
alignment of the N-terminal region showed a more pronounced similarity between human and pig Reelin than
between mouse and pig Reelin (Figure 1B). Whether this
difference in conservation has biological implications
needs further investigation.
The human and mouse Reelin genes consist of 65 exons
and our analysis indicates a conserved genomic structure
of the pig Reelin gene (data not shown). Evolutionary
conserved alternative splicing of a brain specific Reelin
gene miniexon, exon 64, has been described [44]. Human
and mouse Reelin gene exon 64 consists of 6 nt. The
above described pig Reelin mRNA includes a 6 nt exon 64
and according to the nomenclature of human and mouse

C) Detection of alternative splicing of pig Reelin. Primers were designed specific for Reelin isoform a including exon 64 (upper panel); specific for Reelin isoform b excluding exon 64 (central panel); or GAPDH as internal control. Expression was detected by reverse transcriptase PCR with
cortical cDNA from the indicated time points.

Reelin the corresponding pig mRNA is abbreviated isoform a. To determine if Reelin isoform b, which lacks
exon 64 in the mRNA sequence, also existed in the pig we
performed a RT-PCR analysis. Two different forward
primers were designed which could distinguish the inclusion of exon 64 and the primers were used in RT-PCR
together with a reverse primer in exon 65 (Figure 1C). As
template was used pig embryonic cortical cDNA. By this
approach we could detect the existence of Reelin isoform
b [Genebank accession no. BK006771]. Using cortical
cDNA representing different developmental points we
observed parallel expression profiles for the two Reelin
isoforms in accordance with observations from other
mammalian species [44]. Using a RT-PCR primer combination from exon 63 to exon 65 followed by sequencing
we estimated that pig Reelin isoform b was expressed at a
lower level than isoform a, also in accordance with data
from other mammalians (data not shown) [44]. In summary, pig Reelin mRNA and protein show highly conserved properties compared to other mammalian species.
Expression of pig Reelin cDNA and protein in the
developing cortex

We studied the expression pattern of Reelin protein during pig brain development by Western blot analysis. A
Reelin protein band was clearly visible at the early stage,
E28, which corresponds to the phase of preplate formation in the pig (Figure 2A). The Clone 142 antibody
detects the full-length protein band in the 5% gel (Figure

2A, lower image) in the lanes containing cortical extracts
from E50, E60 and E70. The presence of this band is
restricted to this time interval. The other bands recognized in the 5% gel correspond to length of around 320
kDa and 160 kDa, which are the dominant bands in
extract from brain tissue [45,46].
In 4-15% gradient gels no clear full length band was
detected. It may be trapped in the slot due to high contend of polyacrylamid fibers. The 320 kDa band appeared
between E42 and E100 while two strong bands of about
160 kDa and 65 kDa in length were consistently present
except for the 65 kDa band at E28. The low molecular
band of 65 kDa has been observed in extracts from brain
tissue as far back in phylogeny as sea lamprey using both
clones 142 and G10 Reelin antibodies. It has been suggested to represent a proteolytic fragment [47], but there
is no identified proteolytic site in the N-terminal region
of Reelin recognized by the antibodies that could account
for the size of 65 kDa corresponding to, approximately,
650aa.
Interestingly, a band of ~70 kDa was detected at very
low intensity at E50, growing in intensity to peak in E80
and then decreasing (Figure 2A, 4-15% gel). This band
has not previously been described in any animal. The
intensity variation does to some extend follow the bellshaped-like variation in RNA expression of the Reelin
gene during this embryonic period (Figure 2B). When
comparing the intensities of the other bands in the gel the

slightly decreased through the late developmental stages
(Figure 2A).
mRNA expression levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR
and the resulting pattern was consistent with the observations from Reelin immunoblots (Figure 2A and 2B).
mRNA was initially detected at very low levels at E21
(Figure 2B). This stage corresponds to an early stage in
preplate formation. The mRNA levels increased from E21
through E40 and E50 to a peak at E60. This increase was
followed by a decline in expression to a plateau level from
E60 to E100 followed by a further decrease to E115 (Figure 2B).

Clone 142 on protein samples purified from cerebral cortex of embryonic pigs at the indicated developmental stages. Brain extracts were
resolved by PAGE using either a 5% (lower) or 4-15%-gradient gel (upper). Three bands are seen in the samples, of about 400, 320 and ~160
kDa in the 5% gels and 320, ~160, 70, and 65 kDa in the gradient gels.
Beta-actin was used as loading control. B) Quantitative analyses of Reelin mRNA expression during pig embryonic brain development. The
expression levels were normalized to the expression levels of GAPDH,
18S rRNA and β-actin in the same tissue using the geNorm program.

~70 kDa band does not appear to be a proteolytic product
of either the 320 kDa or 160 kDa bands. An alternative
explanation could be a new splice variant found in the
porcine brain. Western blotting experiments performed
on mouse brain tissue spanning the period from embryonic day 9 to postnatal day 14 did not reveal this band
(data not shown). A functional implication of the ~70
kDa band is difficult to predict since Jossin et al. showed
that a protein fragment consisting of the repeats 3 to 6 is
necessary and sufficient for binding to the lipoprotein
receptors and subsequent phosphorylation of dab1 [48].
The Reelin expression gradually increased to reach a
peak of expression at E60, corresponding to a period of
intense neuronal migration form the proliferative layers
into the cortical plate (Figure 2A). The Reelin expression

Immunohistochemical staining for Reelin at E40 (and
earlier time points; data not shown) showed no staining
of any cell type (Figure 3A and 3B). At E60, Reelin positive cells were seen in the outer part of the MZ (Figure 3C
and 3D) and a few small round immunoreactive cells
were identified in layers III-V of the cortical plate (CP)
(Fig 3C and small magnification image). These cells were
identified as interneurons in a variety of mammals
[32,49,50]. For the most part, the antibody against Reelin
stained the cytoplasm of the cells and immunoreactive
dendrites and axons were rarely observed. The Reelin
expressing neurons located in the outer part of the MZ
displayed a different morphology. The main part of the
neurons were elongated with the axis oriented parallel to
the pial surface, resemble CR cells (Figure 3D), others
were small round interneurons (Figure 3D) and neurons
oriented perpendicular to the pial surface could be indentified in the inner part of the MZ. At later stages E80,
E100, and E115 (Figure 3E to 3J), the immunoreactive
cells decreased in number. A few bipolar and fusiform CR
type cells restricted to the outer part of the MZ could be
identified (indicated with open arrow in Figure 3F; see
also Figure 3H and 3J) along with a decreasing number of
Reelin positive interneurons in the CP at E80 (Figure 3E)
these neurons were not detectable at later embryonic
stages.

Conclusion
In the present study, we describe the identification and
characterization of pig Reelin cDNA and protein. The
Reelin protein shows a high degree of homology to the
human Reelin. The expression profile of pig Reelin during
cortical development resembles human Reelin. In accordance with the mRNA expression level the Reelin protein
expression is initiated at early developmental stages and
increases during corticogenesis. The same expression
patterns are reported in human and the mouse embryonic brain tissue [31,32]. Immunohistochemical analysis
of Reelin expression also shows localization within CR

Tissue

Embryos/foetuses were obtained from artificially inseminated landrace sows (Sus Scrofa). Pregnant sows were
anaesthetized by inhalation of 35-70% CO2 for one minute and sacrificed by exsanguination. The uteri were
recovered immediately and the embryos/foetuses from
21, 28, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 100, and 115 days post conception (dpc/E) were quickly removed, and dissected. The
anterior part was dissected form 21 and 28 embryos. Cortices from the remaining tissue were dissected and flash
frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after dissection and
stored at -80°C after dissection. Tissue for immunohistochemical analysis was immersed in formalin (SigmaAldrich). All experiments were approved by the local and
national animal ethical committee and are in accordance
with National legislation on experimental animals.
Immunohistochemistry

Formalin fixated tissues were embedded in paraffin
blocks and cut in 4 μm sections and mounted on superfrost slides. Slides were dewaxed in xylene and rehydrated
using graded ethanol washes. All immunohistochemistry
was performed using the automated staining system
Autostainer (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Sections were
stained with antibodies directed against Reelin (1/400;
Chemicon, MAB5366). IHC staining was performed
using DakoCytomation EnVision + System HRP (#K4004)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sections
were counterstained with hematoxylin for 30 s, dehydrated in graded ethanol washes, and mounted. Human
brain tissue (normal and tumour tissue) was used as control. Microscopic images were taken with a DC 480 camera (Leica Microsystems A/S) and processed using IM50
imaging and capture software (Leica Microsystems A/S).
Western blotting

100-200 mg of tissue representing the entire cortical
sheet from flash frozen frontal cortex was transferred to a
Dounce tissue-grinder (Wheaton #357542). 2 ml Lysis
buffer (Tris-HCl 50 mM, NaCl 150 mM, 1% NP-40, one
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail Tablet (Roche)/10 ml Lysis
buffer; pH 8.0) was added and homogenisation was performed on ice [51]. Solution was transferred to Eppendorf tubes (1 ml) and centrifuged at 20,000 rpm for 20
min. (4°C). The supernatant was transferred to new
tubes. The protein extract was kept on ice until use.

Protein concentrations were measured using by the
Bradford method.
Four micrograms of protein was added 5 × Loading
Buffer (Fermentas), 20 × Reducing Agent (Fermentas)
and PBS to a final volume of 15 μl and a 1 × concentration, and the samples were heated to 100°C for 2 min. The
time of denaturation at 100°C was reduced to 2 min. to
reduce degradation of the full-length Reelin protein.
Western blotting analyses were performed at standard
conditions using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies for detection and visualization by BM
Chemiluminescence (Roche). Beta-Actin (Abcam,
#ab8227) was used as loading control (1:10,000) and the
monoclonal Reelin (clone 142; Calbiochem, # 553730)
antibody was used. Samples were separated on 4-15%
Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad), run in parallel with ProSieve
Color Protein Markers (Lonza, # 50550), and transferred
to PVDF membranes (HYBOND-P PVDF 0.45 μm pore
size; GE Helthcare, # 25006203). Blots were blocked in
blocking buffer (10% non-fat dry milk, 1% Tween 20 and
PBS), overnight at 4 degrees, rinsed, incubated in primary
antibody (diluted in 0,5% non-fat dry milk, 0,1% Tween
20 and PBS) for 1.5 hr (all steps at room temperature),
rinsed, incubated in peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody in blocking buffer for 1 hr, rinsed, incubated in
enhanced
BM
Chemiluminescence
(Roche,
#
11500694001), and exposed to film (Hyperfilm MP; GE
Helthcare, # 25800086) for 0.1-10 min.
RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, and RT-PCR

Unless otherwise stated, all solutions were prepared with
water that had been treated with 0.1% diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC). Tissue (50-100 mg) representing the
entire cortical sheet was dissected from frontal cortices
and homogenized in an RNase-free Dounce tissuegrinder (Wheaton #357542). 2 ml TriReagent (Sigma)
was added and homogenisation was performed. RNA was
extracted using chloroform and Isopropanol precipitation. The RNA pellet was washed twice in 70% Ethanol

and re-suspended in 50 μl DEPC-H2O. The quantity was
spectrophotometrically determined by measuring the
absorbance at wavelength 260 (OD260) and the quality
checked by electrophoresis of 0.5 μg RNA on ethidium
bromide stained 1% agarose gels.
cDNA was synthesized from 2,5 μg total RNA in 50-μL
reactions using iScript™ cDNA synthesis Kit (Biorad).
After synthesis, the cDNA was diluted five times with
water and stored at 4°C.
RT-PCR analysis to detect Reelin spliceforms were
done at standard PCR conditions with 30 cycles of amplification. Primers for the analysis were: Exon65Reverse,
GGATTCTTCATGGGTATCG TC; Reelin-a-forward,
CATGTGGAAGTTGTCCTAGT;
Reelin-b-forward,
CATGTGGAAGTTGT CCTCAC.
Quantitative real-timePCR

qRT-PCR was performed using the iCycler Thermal
Cycler (Bio-Rad, iCycler iQ™ Real-time PCR Detection
System). Reactions were performed in triplicates in a
total volume of 20 μl each using DyNAmoTM HS SYBR®
GREEN qPCR Kit (Finnzymes). The primers were
designed using primer3 http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/
with a total length between 18-22 bp, Tm 58 ≤ 60 ≥ 63 and
a GC% of min. 40% and max. 80%. Primers were
restricted to produce an amplicon in the range of 180 to
220 bp. Pig sequences were used if available. When pig
sequences were unavailable, primers were designed from
conserved regions among human, mouse and bovine
sequences. A BLAST analysis was performed to eliminate
unspecific hybridization of homolog sequences. Two
micro litres cDNA was used as template and 6 pmol of
each primer, designed to amplify across at least one predicted exon-intron boundary (sequences in Table 1).
Exon-intron boundaries were predicted using the

After each assay, the identity of the PCR products was
confirmed by melting-curve analysis, gel electrophoresis
and, sequenced to confirm the identity of the PCR amplicon. Primer sequences are presented in Table 1.
