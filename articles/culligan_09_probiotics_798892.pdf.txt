Abstract
Gastrointestinal disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide each year.
Treatment of chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal conditions such as ulcerative colitis and
Crohn's disease is difficult due to the ambiguity surrounding their precise aetiology. Infectious
gastrointestinal diseases, such as various types of diarrheal disease are also becoming increasingly
difficult to treat due to the increasing dissemination of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms
and the emergence of the so-called 'superbugs'. Taking into consideration these problems, the need
for novel therapeutics is essential. Although described for over a century probiotics have only been
extensively researched in recent years. Their use in the treatment and prevention of disease,
particularly gastrointestinal disease, has yielded many successful results, some of which we outline
in this review. Although promising, many probiotics are hindered by inherent physiological and
technological weaknesses and often the most clinically promising strains are unusable.
Consequently we discuss various strategies whereby probiotics may be engineered to create
designer probiotics. Such innovative approaches include; a receptor mimicry strategy to create
probiotics that target specific pathogens and toxins, a patho-biotechnology approach using
pathogen-derived genes to create more robust probiotic stains with increased host and processingassociated stress tolerance profiles and meta-biotechnology, whereby, functional metagenomics
may be used to identify novel genes from diverse and vastly unexplored environments, such as the
human gut, for use in biotechnology and medicine.

Introduction
The first suggestion of the health benefits of probiotics
dates back to the early 20th century, when Russian scientist
Eli Metchnikoff attributed the long life of Bulgarian peasants to their consumption of fermented milk containing
lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and believed that 'the dependence
of the intestinal microbes on the food makes it possible to adopt
measures to modify the flora in our bodies and to replace the
harmful microbes with useful microbes' [1]. While early

research yielded poor results and received little attention,
in the last 20 years probiotic research has again come to
the forefront of scientific research with significant
progress being made in the development of clinically
effective probiotic strains. Probiotics are defined as 'live
microorganisms which when administered in adequate
amounts confer a health benefit on the host' [2]. There is
an increasing body of evidence to suggest that probiotics
can be used in the treatment and prevention of infections

and chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract.
Use of probiotics in the treatment and prevention of
gastrointestinal disease
Diarrheal disease
Each year gastrointestinal infections are responsible for
significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The
World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates there to be
more than four billion episodes of diarrheal disease annually, while there were 2.2 million deaths attributable to
diarrheal disease in 2004, making it the fifth leading cause
of death at all ages worldwide [3]. Probiotics have been
used in the treatment and prevention of many forms of
diarrheal disease.

(i) Rotavirus diarrhea: A double-blind randomized
placebo-controlled trial of 230 children using the probiotic formulation VSL#3 was found to significantly
reduce stool frequency and requirement for oral rehydration salts (ORS) compared to the placebo group,
resulting in reduced recovery time [4]. In another
study, administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG to
infants admitted to hospital with non-diarrheal complaints, reduced the risk of both nosocomial diarrhea
and symptomatic rotavirus gastroenteritis [5].
(ii) Travellers' diarrhea: Travellers diarrhea is a frequent problem among travellers to foreign countries,
especially in South America, South East Asia and
Africa. A meta-analysis of 940 studies by (12 of which
met the inclusion criteria; various database searches
from 1977 to 2005 to include randomization, controlled, blinded efficacy trials in humans from peer
reviewed journals) concluded that probiotics are safe
and effective for prevention of traveller's diarrhea [6].
However, contradictory results are often seen in studies of this kind due to differences in populations studied, type of probiotics used and the duration of
treatment. Also, a number of factors may affect the
efficacy of treatment such as travel destination, probiotic viability during the trip and traveller compliance
with treatment.
(iii) Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD): AAD is
often seen in patients receiving antibiotic therapy
which results in the suppression of the normal host
gastrointestinal microflora, thus facilitating the overgrowth of enteropathogens, which can cause diarrhea
and colonic inflammation (colitis). In extreme cases,
Clostridium difficile can often cause pseudomembranous enterocolitis [7], which can be fatal. A clinical
trial by Ruszczyński and co-workers assessed the efficacy of three L. rhamnosus strains in the prevention of
AAD [8]. In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-

http://www.gutpathogens.com/content/1/1/19

controlled trial of 240 children, 20 patients in the placebo group had diarrhea compared to nine in the probiotic group. Furthermore, AAD diarrhea was seen in
nine placebo patients compared to three of those
administered the probiotic preparation. Also, various
meta-analyses have shown probiotics to be successful
in the prevention of AAD [9,10].
(iv) Clostridium difficile is a major cause of nosocomial
infection with symptoms ranging from mild diarrhea
to severe pseudmembranous enterocolitis, sepsis and
death [11]. Overall, adequate evidence is lacking to
recommend the use of probiotics in the prevention or
treatment of C. difficile. There have been some promising studies using the probiotic yeast, Saccharomyces
boulardii [12,13] however more research is needed
encompassing large, standardised clinical trials with
different probiotic strains.
Necrotizing enterocolitits (NEC)
NEC is a serious gastrointestinal condition typically seen
in premature infants. Symptoms include abdominal distension, bloody stool, and lethargy. A number of studies
have demonstrated that probiotic therapy reduced both
the incidence and severity of NEC in a study of very low
birth weight infants [14,15].
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
IBD encompasses chronic inflammatory conditions of the
gastrointestinal tract, characterized by unpredictable and
spontaneous periods of remission and relapse. The most
common types of IBD are ulcerative colitis (UC) and
Crohn's disease (CD), with the prevalence of IBD estimated to be 1.4 million in the United States and 2.2 million in Europe [16]. While the precise aetiology of IBD is
unknown, genetic susceptibility, imbalances or disruption
to the commensal host microflora [17] especially a reduction in the Firmicutes phylum [18] and an abnormal
intestinal immune response [19,20] are thought to play
an important role in disease manifestation. Consequently, probiotics have been utilised in an attempt to reestablish the balance of the host microflora and attenuate
an aberrant immune response. In a trial of UC patients
investigating the effect of an oral capsule containing Bifidobacteria following treatment with sulfasalazine and glucocorticoids (a standard therapy for UC) it was found that
93.3% of patients in the placebo group suffered a relapse
compared to only 20% in the probiotic group. A significant reduction in inflammation was also seen in those
administered the probiotic compared to the control group
[21]. A recent study has shown promising potential for the
use of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii as a probiotic with antiinflammatory properties in the treatment of CD [22]. This
bacterium was found in lower numbers in patients with
recurrent CD. F. prausnitzii and its supernatant was found

Gut Pathogens 2009, 1:19

to have anti-inflammatory effects both in vitro and in vivo,
inducing interleukin 10 (IL-10) production in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's), reducing IL-8 and
NF-κβ (pro-inflammatory compounds) in Caco-2 cell
lines and attenuating the severity of induced colitis in
mice [22]. There is, as yet, little evidence documenting the
effectiveness of probiotics in the treatment of CD and as
such further research is required. Shanahan [23] suggests
that differences in the composition of the host microflora
and the locations of CD-associated lesions respectively
along the GI tract may indicate one probiotic strain is not
sufficient to exert a beneficial effect in different patients.
Furthermore, the author poses the question of whether
researchers are using the correct probiotic, at a high
enough dose and for the correct indication. Overall, only
a limited number of studies are available and often results
are conflicting, but there is sufficient evidence to warrant
further research. Future studies need to be randomized,
double-blind placebo-controlled trials encompassing
large subject bases and possibly using combination therapies with more than one probiotic strain. Probiotics have
also been used in the treatment and prevention of other
gastrointestinal disorders including; irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) [24] and Helicobacter pylori associated infection (for a review see; [25]), as well as in nongastrointestinal conditions such as urinary tract infections
(UTI's) [26] and atopic diseases [27].
Selection criteria and characteristics of probiotics
Before bacteria can be considered for use as probiotics, it
is recommended that they meet certain selection criteria
and possess a number of intrinsic physico-chemical characteristics outlined in a joint report by the FAO and WHO
in 2002 [28]. The report sets out a number of guidelines
that should be followed so as to standardise procedures
when assessing probiotics for use in foods and validating
health claims thereof. The guidelines include: probiotic
health effects are usually strain specific [29] so it is important to characterize probiotics to the strain level and with
current nomenclature and subsequently deposit them in
an international culture collection. It was recommended
that in vitro tests be carried out before any subsequent in
vivo animal or human trials were initiated. Furthermore,
these tests require substantiation with in vivo performance. Common in vitro tests performed on probiotics
include resistance to gastric acidity and bile, adherence to
mucus and/or human epithelial cells, bile salt hydrolase
activity, reduction of pathogen adherence to surfaces and
antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria such as
Heliocbacter pylori, Salmonella sp., Listeria monocytogenes
and Clostridium difficile. The report also outlines some
safety considerations when dealing with probiotics. While
probiotic bacteria, as a group, are generally regarded as
safe (GRAS) organisms, safety tests should include the
determination of antibiotic resistance profiles, evaluation

http://www.gutpathogens.com/content/1/1/19

of certain metabolic activities such as D-lactate production and bile salt deconjugation (an undesirable action in
the small bowel), assessment of side effects in humans trials, post market epidemiological surveillance of adverse
effects in consumers, toxin production and haemolytic
activity. Furthermore, animal trials should be undertaken,
where possible and appropriate, before commencing
human studies. There have been very few reports of possible systemic infections attributed to probiotics [30-32]
and in those rare instances, all occurred in patients with
serious underlying medical conditions. However, demonstration of lack of infectivity in immuno-compromised
animals is also desirable to reinforce the safety profile of
the probiotic strain. Large human clinical trials with probiotics are sorely lacking and the report recommends double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trials for
humans with a sufficiently large participant base and preferably that the trial be repeated by an independent laboratory to confirm the outcome. The full report can be

In vivo survival
Following oral administration, probiotics must survive
transit through the gastrointestinal tract, facing host-associated stresses such as the low pH environment of the
stomach (which can be as low as pH 1.5 when fasting)
[33] as well as bile and elevated osmolarity in the intestine. Once in the gut they must be able to colonise and
proliferate and exert a beneficial effect on the host. In
addition to host-associated stresses, probiotics encounter
technological stresses during processing, formulation and
packaging and must survive in sufficient numbers for an
extended period of time during their shelf-life, often at
refrigeration temperatures. They should also possess good
organoleptic properties and be phage resistant [34].
Potential probiotic strains need to be both physiologically
and technologically robust, but even the toughest strains
are restricted in the variety of food applications to which
they can be applied. In addition the most promising and
clinically relevant probiotics are unfortunately often rendered unusable due to their physiological and technological fragility [34]. Pre-exposing probiotic strains to stresses
such as sodium chloride (NaCl), elevated temperature,
bile and low pH can increase their survival and viability
[35,36]. This pre-exposure to sub-lethal stresses can significantly increase their survival following subsequent exposure to lethal stress. It has been demonstrated that
exposing Bifidobacterium adolescentis to 47°C for 15 minutes prior to a lethal heat shock increased the strain's heat
tolerance 128-fold [37]. Furthermore it has been shown
that acid-resistant strains can be produced by subjecting
acid-sensitive strains to prolonged exposure (16 hours) to
pH2.0 [38]. The acid-resistant derivatives were seen to
obtain a cross-protective effect from acid exposure, grow-

ing better in the presence of both bile and NaCl, whilst
also having an increased fermentative ability and enzymatic activity. Such treatments however can result in a significant decrease in cell yield, as well as cellular activity
and process volumetric productivity [39]. A recent study
compared the stress tolerance profiles of eight probiotic
strains following microencapsulation challenged with
acid, bile and heat stress [40]. Microencapsulated strains
survived three logs CFU/ml better than free probiotic control strains. Increased survival was also observed for acid
and mild heat treatment in the microencapsulated strains.
Other strategies such as immobilized-cell technology [41]
have also been shown to enhance the stress tolerance profiles of certain probiotic strains. However further research
is required before industry standards are reached [39] and
research on technologies such as microencapsulation and
its benefits on the stability and release of bioactive compounds in the gastrointestinal tract [42].
A need for alternative strategies
Whilst it has been clearly demonstrated that probiotics
can be effective therapeutics in certain cases
[4,8,15,21,26] results are often conflicting and can vary
between and within individuals. This is due in part to different modes of action of probiotics as well as strain specific effects. Coupled with this, the increase in antibiotic
resistance due to the indiscriminate use, overuse and misuse of antibiotics and the emergence of the so-called
'superbugs' (multi-antibiotic resistant strains), the need
for novel and alternative therapies is paramount. The economic burden to the medical care sector in the United
States for the treatment of patients with infections caused
by antibiotic resistant organisms is estimated to be four
billion $US annually [43]. In addition, the fact that no
new antibiotic classes have been discovered [44] and that
pharmaceutical companies have severely reduced investment and in some cases, completely abandoned antimicrobial research and development [45], reinforces the
point that radically new and innovative therapies are
urgently needed. The design, creation and genetic modification of probiotic stains exclusively tailored to target a
specific pathogen or toxin thereof, or as vaccine and drug
delivery vehicles is a promising and rapidly expanding
area of research.

In support of this, lactobacilli possessing desirable properties such as inherent immunogenicity, bile resistance
and the ability survive and proliferate in the gastrointestinal tract [46], have been successfully employed as oral,
mucosal vaccine delivery vehicles. Such vaccine delivery
vehicles offer an advantage over traditional live attenuated pathogenic strains in that there is no possibility of
reversion to a virulent phenotype which always remains
with the attenuated pathogenic strains [46]. The majority
of pathogens initiate their initial infection at a mucosal

http://www.gutpathogens.com/content/1/1/19

surface and vaccination against such pathogens is best
accomplished through mucosal vaccination. Mucosal vaccines offer a number of functional advantages [47] as well
as practical benefits; they are non-invasive, easy to administer and do not require the presence of medically trained
personnel, a significant advantage in the developing
world [48]. Lactobacilli expressing Tetanus toxin fragment
C (TTFC) have been shown to be able to elicit a positive
immune response [49]. Such a strategy could be applied
to the expression of other toxins from enteric pathogens,
thus providing immune protection. In addition, a recombinant Lactococcus lactis strain producing human IL-10 has
been investigated in a human clinical trial for treatment of
Crohn's disease [50].
Designer probiotics
As previously mentioned, diarrheal diseases are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide and
treatment is becoming increasingly more difficult due to
the rise in antibiotic resistance. Paton and co-workers
described the development of designer probiotics for the
prevention of gastrointestinal infections using a strategy
involving the expression of host cell receptor-mimics on
the surface of probiotic strains which can bind to the pathogen itself or neutralize and mop up secreted toxin
[51,52] (Figure 1). This approach has a number of advantages; (i) the probiotic can be administered orally (ii)
numerous human receptors recognized by enteric pathogens or their toxins are well characterized (iii) preventing
pathogen adherence would inhibit development of infection (iv) sequestration of a toxin would prevent clinical
presentation of symptoms so the pathogen can be
removed by the host immune system and possibly most
importantly (v) this therapeutic strategy does not apply a
selective pressure on the pathogen with the of development of resistance extremely unlikely. Resistance usually
results from a reduction in bacterial cells numbers due to
the selective pressure and this does not occur with receptor mimic therapy.

Research in the same lab has resulted in the construction
of a harmless Escherichia coli strain engineered to express
two galactosyl-transferase genes from Neisseria gonorrhoeae. This resulted in a modified lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) that mimics the Shiga-toxin (Stx) receptor and was
found to effectively bind both Stx1 and Stx2. The engineered bacteria were shown to be 100% effective in treating mice infected with normally fatal shigatoxigenic E. coli
(STEC) [53]. In another study by the same research group,
a probiotic was developed for the treatment of travellers'
diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). Using a
similar strategy to that mentioned above, an E. coli strain
was engineered to produce a chimeric LPS receptor mimic
capable of binding a heat-labile enterotoxin. In vitro tests
showed more than 93% of the toxin could be neutralized

by the recombinant strain, while in vivo studies showed
the recombinant strain provided protection against fluid
loss due to the toxin in rabbit ligated ileal loops [54]. A
molecular mimicry strategy was also used to create a
recombinant probiotic for the treatment and prevention
of cholera. Cholera, caused by the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, is a serious intestinal infection characterized by
severe, watery diarrhea resulting in rapid fluid loss and
dehydration which can lead to death in just a few hours
without treatment. Transmission is via the fecal-oral
route, usually due to consumption of contaminated
drinking water and the disease is epidemic in many developing countries. Current treatment is administration of a
standard oral rehydration solution (ORS) to replace lost
fluids, salts and electrolytes in combination with antibiotics in some cases. This is usually an effective treatment but
must be administered promptly following infection. A
similar strategy was used to design a probiotic strain with
an altered LPS which terminates in a structure that mimics
the GM1 ganglioside terminus, which is the binding receptor for cholera toxin (CT) [55]. The bacteria were found to
be able to bind CT, abolish >99% of its cytotoxicity and
absorb more than 5% of its own weight of toxin. Murine
studies demonstrated that administration of the recombinant probiotic immediately following infection with V.
cholerae increased survival rates of the mice. Furthermore,

when administration of the probiotic was delayed until
after establishment of V. cholerae infection, all mice in the
probiotic group survived compared to 1 out of 12 for the
control group [55]. Such powerful and significant results
reinforce the potential of such alternative therapies. Further research to improve and fine-tune this approach may
be necessary before such therapies can be applied to
humans. For example it has been suggested that the introduction of genes to aid gastric transit or promote
improved gut colonization would reduce dose regimes
and thus costs, while the use of food grade bacteria such
as lactococci and lactobacilli for receptor mimicry may
also be possible [51]. As mentioned earlier, evidence is
lacking for the recommendation of probiotics for use in
the treatment of C. difficile. However designer probiotics
may offer a viable alternative [56]. The bacteriocin lacticin
3147 has been shown to have significant antibacterial
activity against C. difficile [57] however it is acutely sensitive to gastric acidity in vivo [58]. This sensitivity might be
overcome by cloning bacteriocin production (and resistance) genes into a suitable host, such as a lactobacillus
which could survive stomach passage and deliver the
intact bacteriocin to the point of infection. Furthermore,
designer probiotics meet the criteria laid out by McFarland [59] for novel approaches to manage C. difficile
[56,60-62]. With regard to inflammatory bowel disease,

there have been some studies involving recombinant probiotics with some good preliminary results being seen in
the treatment of induced- colitis in animal models [6062]. However, more information is needed on the exact
causes of such conditions before suitable treatments can
be fully developed for use in human trials.

tric acid, bile, low iron, increased osmolarity) if introduced to a probiotic could prove to be beneficial by
increasing its resistance to host-associated stresses as well
as its technological robustness and clinical efficacy, a distinct advantage with many potentially promising probiotic strains [34].

Patho-biotechnology
The term patho-biotechnology was coined to describe the
concept of exploiting pathogenic bacteria or more precisely, exploitation of their stress adaptation, host evasion
and virulence or virulence-associated characteristics for
beneficial use in the biotechnology and food industries
and in medicine [63]. The patho-biotechnology concept
encompasses a number of different areas. Firstly, it
involves the use of pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes as novel vaccine and drug delivery vehicles [64].
This may be approached either by the use of conditional
auxotrophic mutants or the selective elimination of key
virulence factors. Secondly, such a strategy may involve
the isolation of certain immunogenic proteins from specific pathogens thus removing the necessity of using the
pathogen itself as the carrier vehicle [65]. The final area
applicable to the patho-biotechnology approach and the
main focus of this chapter is the introduction of stress survival genes from pathogenic bacteria into non-pathogenic
probiotic strains [63]. Probiotic microorganisms encounter an identical set of stress conditions as pathogens upon
encountering a host (Figure 2). Thus from a human point
of view, an undesirable element from a pathogen (e.g.
genes that aid survival in stressful conditions such as gas-

L. monocytogenes serves as an ideal candidate for the pathobiotechnology concept [66]. Its genome has been fully
sequenced [67], L. monocytogenes is amenable to genetic
manipulation [68] while physiologically it is a robust
pathogen capable of resisting numerous stresses [69]
while also eliciting a strong host immune response [70].

Challenges:
Survive gastric juice

The patho-biotechnology approach has been successfully
employed to increase the stress tolerance of the probiotic
bacterium Lactobacillus salivarius UCC118 [71]. L. salivarius has been shown to have desirable therapeutic properties [72] and has recently been shown to protect mice
from L. monocytogenes infection by the production of the
bacteriocin, Abp118 [73]. However the bacterium is technologically fragile. In an effort to improve the physiological robustness of the strain the betL gene of L.
monocytogenes (encoding the compatible solute betaine
uptake system, BetL) was cloned into L. salivarius UCC118
[71]. Bacteria accumulate compatible solutes such as
betaine, either from their environment or by de novo synthesis, to counter osmotic stress. BetL has been shown to
increase L. monocytogenes tolerance to salt [74], low temperature [75] and pressure stress [76], as well as increasing
viability in certain foods [77]. Thus, it was postulated that
the introduction of betL into L. salivarius UCC118 might
improve the strain's tolerance to a number of stresses.
Indeed the strain harbouring the betL gene (betL+) showed
a significantly higher growth rate at 7% NaCl compared to
the control strain lacking bet (betL-) (Figure 3). Also, when

lacked betL) [78]. To the best of our knowledge this study
provides the first direct evidence for improved therapeutic
efficacy using a patho-biotechnology based approach.

Furthermore, significantly higher survival rates for betL+
were observed following both freeze and spray drying
treatment compared to the control. Higher survival rates
were also observed following high pressure processing
(300 and 350 MPa). These results clearly demonstrate the
potential of patho-biotechnology for improving the technological robustness of probiotic microorganisms. In
addition to improving a strain's resistance to stresses
encountered during food manufacture and storage, the
patho-biotechnology concept has also been applied to tailor improved probiotic resistance to host specific stresses,
significantly improving colonization, persistence and
clinical efficacy. In support of this, the betL gene from L.
monocytogenes was cloned into the probiotic bacterium
Bifidobacterium breve UCC2003 [78]. B. breve UCC2003
strains expressing betL were shown to exhibit significantly
increased tolerance to simulated gastric juice (pH 2.5) as
well as osmotic stress. In addition, following successful
colonization of the murine intestine, B. breve UCC2003
betL+ strains were recovered at significantly higher levels in
the faeces, large intestine and caecum of inoculated mice.
Finally, the B. breve UCC2003 betL+ strain was shown to
protect against L. monocytogenes infection in a murine
model. L. monocytogenes was recovered in significantly
lower numbers from the spleens of mice fed with B. breve
UCC2003 betL+ compared the control strain (which

Following these initial experiments, subsequent research
was carried out in relation to improving the bile tolerance
of two common probiotic strains. The authors cloned the
bile exclusion system, BilE (genes bilEA and bilEB) from L.
monocytogenes into both L. lactis NZ9000 and B. breve
UCC2003 [79]. The BilE system functions as a cellular bile
exclusion system and aids gastrointestinal transit and persistence in L. monocytogenes [80]. It was therefore postulated that heterologous expression of the BilE system
would increase bile tolerance and subsequent gastrointestinal persistence of the probiotic strains. Indeed, the
authors found that both L. lactis and B. breve expressing
bilE exhibited a 2.5 logs greater survival rate compared to
the wild type when grown in porcine bile at concentrations similar to that found in the intestine. Also, both bilE+
strains persisted for longer in the gastrointestinal tract and
murine faeces (Figure 4A), while B. breve bilE+ was recovered at significantly higher numbers (2 logs greater)
directly from the murine intestine compared to the wild
type (Figure 4B). Furthermore B. breve bilE+ significantly
reduced L. monocytogenes numbers in the liver following
oral infection with the pathogen. These results are significant in that increased bile tolerance also conferred
increased gastrointestinal persistence which may enhance
probiotic efficacy in therapeutic models [79].

An alternative approach to using pathogen-derived
genetic elements to improve the physiological robustness
of potential probiotics involves a relatively new and rapidly expanding area of scientific research; metagenomics.
Metagenomics
Metagenomics is the culture-independent analysis of the
collective genomes of a population of microorganisms.
The field of metagenomics is relatively new, with the first
international conference on the topic being held in 2003.
A metagenomic analysis involves the functional and
sequence-based analysis of collective microbial genomes
in an environmental sample [81]. Metagenomics can be
used to study as yet uncultured microbes, which represent
more than 99% of the population in some environments.
The total number of prokaryotic cells on earth has been
estimated at 4-6 × 1030 [82], with the majority of these
remaining unknown to science. This diversity represents a
vast genetic pool that may be utilized for the discovery of
novel genes, entire metabolic pathways and their products
[83]. Functional metagenomic analysis is based on the
construction of clones containing metagenomic DNA in a
surrogate host and subsequent screening of the clones for
the expression of a desired trait or phenotype. Functional
metagenomics has identified novel antibiotics [84], Na+/
H+ anitporter membrane proteins [85], esterases [86], proteases [87] and lipases [88]. Sequence based metagenomics can involve the complete sequencing of clones
containing phylogenetic anchors that indicate the taxanomic group that is the probable source of the DNA fragment or it can involve the random sequencing of clones to
identify a gene of interest and subsequent the search for
phylogenetic anchors in the flanking DNA, which can
provide a link of phylogeny with the functional gene [89].
Sequence based analysis has been used to identify a bacterial rhodopsin gene; the first evidence that rhodopsins are
not exclusive to Archaea [90]. Sequenced based
approaches have also been used to identify novel oxidative coupling enzymes [91], chitinases [92] and a novel
fibrinolytic metalloprotease [93] to name a few.
The human gut metagenome and meta-biotechnology
Research in our laboratory has focused on the human gut
metagenome. The human distal gut is the highest density
natural bacterial ecosystem known and the number of
bacterial cells on or in our bodies is estimated to be 10
times greater than the number of human cells [94]. Furthermore, the number of genes in the representative species probably exceeds the number of human genes by 100fold [95]. In this respect it has been suggested that we as
humans should be considered a superorganism in symbiosis with our vast microflora [96]. This microbiome is
largely untapped and contains a virtually limitless supply
of novel genes to be exploited for use in medicine, science
and industry. Exploiting or 'mining' the human gut

http://www.gutpathogens.com/content/1/1/19

metagenome for the development of novel therapeutics
and designer probiotics, is essentially an extension of the
patho-biotechnology concept. Considering these genes
would be isolated from commensal species they are in
essence 'self' genes and may alleviate some concerns
regarding the use of genetic elements from pathogenic
species. 'Mining' the intestinal flora to discover novel antimicrobial peptides, immunoregulatory molecules and
stress tolerance genes for therapeutic purposes, is a promising and exciting area of research and a logical extension
of the patho-biotechnology concept [97]. We thus coin
the term 'meta-biotechnology' to describe the use of metagenomics as a robust tool to identify novel genes for the use
in biotechnology, specifically building on the patho-biotechnology concept, by increasing the technological and
physiological robustness and clinical efficacy of probiotic
bacteria.
As mentioned above our research has focused on the
human gut metagenome and more specifically the identification of novel osmotolerance loci used by bacteria in
this environment. A metagenomic library of the human
gut microbiome was screened to identify clones with
increased osmotolerance compared to host strain. Representative clones were subsequently subjected to transposon mutagenesis in an attempt to disrupt osmotolerance
loci. We have identified a number of such genes and current work is focused on testing their potential to increase
osmotolerance in other bacterial strains. The ability to
cope with fluctuations in environmental osmolarity is key
to the survival and viability of all microorganisms and
especially so to both bacteria transiently moving through
the human gastrointestinal tract and to those who permanently colonize and proliferate in that environment.
Mechanisms of osmotolerance have been well characterized for the pathogenic bacterium L. monocytogenes (for a
review see [98]) and recently, osmolyte transporters have
been shown to increase bile resistance [99], an important
factor in gastrointestinal persistence. We hope that the
identification of novel osmotolerance loci from our host
microflora using a functional metagenomic approach will
enable us to create probiotic strains with an increased
physiological and technological robustness, as has been
demonstrated previously with genes from the pathogen L.
monocytogenes [71,78,79].
Biological containment
The major disadvantage with designer probiotics is that
they are genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and as
such their use in the treatment of humans would essentially constitute the deliberate release of such a GMO into
the environment. Therefore the safety of such strains
needs to be guaranteed and stringently monitored so that
they do not; (i) possess antibiotic selection markers, (ii)
have the ability to accumulate in the environment and

(iii) transfer the genetic modification to other bacteria
through lateral dissemination. Biological containment
can be divided into active and passive forms. Active containment is conditionally controlled by the production of
a compound that is toxic to the cells. Gene expression is
tightly regulated and controlled by an environmentally
responsive element. Passive containment meanwhile, is
dependent on complementation of an auxotrophy by supplementation with either an intact gene or the essential
metabolite (for a recent review see; [100]. Perhaps the
most elegant method developed to date, which combines
the advantages of both active and passive containment, is
that of the thymidylate synthase gene (thyA) [101]. The
thyA gene form L. lactis, which is essential for growth, was
replaced with the expression cassette for human interleukin-10 (hIL-10) by double crossover using a non-replicative plasmid (pORI19). An indigenous suicide system is
induced by the activation of the SOS repair system and
subsequent DNA fragmentation resulting from thymine
and thymidine auxotrophy. Because thymine or thymidine is essential for growth, the thyA-deficient strain cannot accumulate in the environment in the absence of the
essential growth factors. This approach deals completely
with the biosafety issues mentioned above, in that no
resistance marker is required to guarantee stable inheritance of the transgene, thus removing any concerns regarding the spread of antibiotic resistance. Also, the risk of the
GMO accumulating in the environment is negligible due
to rapid death in the absence of thymine or thymidine.
Finally, in the unlikely event that a functional thyA gene is
acquired by homologous recombination from a closely
related bacterium, the transgene would be lost [101]. One
of the strains developed using this method was approved
in The Netherlands for the use in a human clinical trial for
the treatment of IBD. This was the first clinical trial in
which live genetically modified bacteria were used as biotherapeutics in humans [50].

novel thinking and approaches for the development of
alternative therapeutics for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. Such an alternative strategy, as outlined
above, involves the creation of so called designer probiotics, exclusively tailored to target a specific condition, pathogen or toxin. We have also discussed the pathobiotechnology concept and the promising results seen in
a number of proof of concept studies and introduced the
idea of using metagenomics to identify novel genes for use
in improving the robustness of probiotic strains for the
treatment of gastrointestinal disorders ('meta-biotechnology'). The development of designer probiotics will also
see a reduction in production, delivery and storage costs
by circumventing the short half-life and fragility associated with conventional therapeutics, a distinct advantage
in the developing world. However, consumer acceptance
of genetically engineered designer probiotics remains a
very significant hurdle. However, it is hoped that in addition to the utilization of rigorous biological containment
protocols and the application of comprehensive risk-benefit analyses, the provision of balanced objective information and consumer education on the subject as well as
clearly demonstrable medical benefits will ultimately
allow such therapeutics to gain a broader acceptance in
the general population. With advancements in technologies and further refinements and developments in new
techniques, research in this area will continue to provide
novel bio-therapeutics and therapeutic targets as well as
novel probiotic strains for the treatment and prevention
of gastrointestinal disorders.

Conclusion and future outlook
Although described for over a century probiotics and
research into their health benefits has only come to prominence in the past two decades. The health promoting
benefits and efficacy of probiotics has been demonstrated
in many models of gastrointestinal disease and indeed in
diseases and conditions at other anatomically distinct
locations. The use of probiotics in the treatment of many
forms of diarrheal disease appears especially promising.
However, in some cases results have been conflicting and
large randomized, double blind, placebo controlled
human trials are disappointingly rare. The inherent physiological and technological fragility of what are often
promising candidate probiotic strains can render them
ineffective for clinical use. Coupled with this, the alarming rise in antibiotic resistance and the emergence of
many multi-drug resistant strains emphasize the need for
