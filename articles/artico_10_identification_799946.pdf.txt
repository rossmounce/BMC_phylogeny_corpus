RT-PCR data

Abstract
Background: Normalizing through reference genes, or housekeeping genes, can make more accurate and reliable
results from reverse transcription real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Recent studies have
shown that no single housekeeping gene is universal for all experiments. Thus, suitable reference genes should be
the first step of any qPCR analysis. Only a few studies on the identification of housekeeping gene have been
carried on plants. Therefore qPCR studies on important crops such as cotton has been hampered by the lack of
suitable reference genes.
Results: By the use of two distinct algorithms, implemented by geNorm and NormFinder, we have assessed the
gene expression of nine candidate reference genes in cotton: GhACT4, GhEF1a5, GhFBX6, GhPP2A1, GhMZA, GhPTB,
GhGAPC2, GhbTUB3 and GhUBQ14. The candidate reference genes were evaluated in 23 experimental samples
consisting of six distinct plant organs, eight stages of flower development, four stages of fruit development and in
flower verticils. The expression of GhPP2A1 and GhUBQ14 genes were the most stable across all samples and also
when distinct plants organs are examined. GhACT4 and GhUBQ14 present more stable expression during flower
development, GhACT4 and GhFBX6 in the floral verticils and GhMZA and GhPTB during fruit development. Our
analysis provided the most suitable combination of reference genes for each experimental set tested as internal
control for reliable qPCR data normalization. In addition, to illustrate the use of cotton reference genes we checked
the expression of two cotton MADS-box genes in distinct plant and floral organs and also during flower
development.
Conclusion: We have tested the expression stabilities of nine candidate genes in a set of 23 tissue samples from
cotton plants divided into five different experimental sets. As a result of this evaluation, we recommend the use of
GhUBQ14 and GhPP2A1 housekeeping genes as superior references for normalization of gene expression measures
in different cotton plant organs; GhACT4 and GhUBQ14 for flower development, GhACT4 and GhFBX6 for the floral
organs and GhMZA and GhPTB for fruit development. We also provide the primer sequences whose performance in
qPCR experiments is demonstrated. These genes will enable more accurate and reliable normalization of qPCR
results for gene expression studies in this important crop, the major source of natural fiber and also an important
source of edible oil. The use of bona fide reference genes allowed a detailed and accurate characterization of the
temporal and spatial expression pattern of two MADS-box genes in cotton.

Background
Gene expression analysis is increasingly important in
many fields of biological research. Understanding patterns of expressed genes is crucial to provide insights
into complex regulatory networks and will lead to the
identification of genes relevant to new biological processes [1].
Reverse transcription real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a robust method to study
gene expression changes [2]. The main advantages of
qPCR when compared to other experimental techniques
used to evaluate gene expression levels, such as Northern blot hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), are its higher
sensitivity, specificity, and broad quantification range of
up to seven orders of magnitude [3]. Therefore, qPCR
analysis has become the most common method for validating the whole-genome microarray data or a smaller
set of genes and molecular diagnostics [4]. Although
being extremely powerful technique, qPCR suffers from
certain pitfalls, noteworthy the use of unreliable reference genes for the normalization step [5]. Normalization
is necessary for the correction of non-specific variations,
such as inaccurate quantification of RNA and problems
in the quality of RNA that can trigger variable reverse
transcription and PCR reactions. A number of strategies
have been proposed to normalize qPCR data but normalization remains one of the most important challenges concerning this technique [5].
The expression of reference genes used for normalization in qPCR analysis should remain constant between
the cells of different tissues and under different experimental conditions; otherwise, it can lead to erroneous
results. Recent reports have demonstrated that some of
the most well-known and frequently used reference
genes are inappropriate for normalization in qPCR analysis due to expression variability [6-8]. The importance
of reference genes for plant qPCR analysis has been
recently emphasized even though the identification of
these genes is quite laborious [9,10]. Microarray datasets
can also be a rich source of information for selecting
qPCR reference genes [6], but unfortunately, this tool is
still not available for most of plant species, including
cotton.
The classical housekeeping genes involved in basic cellular processes such as 18 S rRNA, ubiquitin, actin,
b-tubulin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase have been recurrently used as internal controls for
gene expression analysis in plant as they are supposed
to have a uniform expression all samples and experimental conditions tested. However, several reports
demonstrated that the transcript levels of these genes
also vary considerably under different experimental

Page 2 of 12

conditions and are consequently unsuitable for gene
expression studies [6,11]. Statistical algorithms such as
geNorm [1], NormFinder [12] and BestKeeper [13] have
been developed for the evaluation of best suited reference gene(s) for normalization of qPCR data in a given
set of biological samples. Recognizing the importance of
reference genes in normalization of RT-qPCR data, various housekeeping genes have been evaluated for stable
expression under specific conditions in various organisms. Many works have been carried on animal and
human health [3,14] field that describe the identification
of multiple reference genes for normalisation of qPCR
data, but similar reports are scarce in plant research
[4,15,16]. Czechowski et al. (2005) employed a new
strategy for the identification of reference genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Based on the microarray data of Affymetrix ATH1, several new reference genes were
revealed in Arabidopsis [6]. Some of these genes have
no previous information about function in Arabidopsis
or any other organism. The list of new Arabidopsis
reference genes revealed by Czechowski and collaborators was successfully employed to search reference
genes in unrelated species such as Vitis vinifera by
sequence homology [9]. Recently, our group was also
successful in providing new reference genes for qPCR in
Coffea arabica and Brachiaria brizantia using the same
strategy employed in V. vinifera [17,18].
Cotton (Gossypium spp.) is the world’s most important source of natural fiber and also an important
source of edible oil [19]. Because of its unique reproductive developmental aspects and speciation history,
G. hirsutum has attracted considerable scientific interest,
not only among plant breeders and agricultural scientists, but also among taxonomists, developmental geneticists, and evolutionary biologists [20-24]. In spite of this,
qPCR analyses in cotton are still hampered by the use
of inappropriate references genes.
In this study, we report the validation of housekeeping
genes to identify the most suitable internal control gene
(s) for normalization of qPCR data obtained in different
plant organs and floral verticils and also during flower
and fruit development. In addition, to illustrate the usefulness of the new reference genes, we provided a
detailed expression analysis of two MADS-box transcription factors in cotton, putative homologues of Arabidopsis AGAMOUS and SEPALLATA3 genes.

Methods
Plant Material

Experiments were performed using three-month old
Gossypim hirsutum plants variety “BRS Cedro”. Plants
were grown under controlled temperature (21 ± 4°C)
and natural photoperiod in Embrapa CENARGEM in

Brasília (DF, Brazil). The organs used from cotton plants
were flower buds, fruits, leaves, stems, branches, roots
and floral meristem. We also included seven stages of
flower development (flower buds with the following diameter sizes: 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12 mm) and four stages
of fruit development (fruits with the following diameter
sizes:10 to 15, 16 to 20, 21 to 30 and larger than 30
mm)[25]. The stages of flower and fruit and the respective major events of development are summarized in
Additional file 1. In addition, floral organs (sepal, petal,
stamen, carpel and pedicel) from 6 mm flower buds
were dissected and harvested. The material was harvested from, at least, five different cotton plants to
obtain one pool. The procedure was repeated with five
distinct plants in order to obtain a second pool, the biological replicate. All samples were immediately frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until needed for
RNA extraction.
Total RNA isolation and cDNA synthesis

Frozen samples were ground to a fine powder in liquid
nitrogen with a pestle and mortar. The total RNA
extractions were performed from 100 mg of each macerate plant tissue in liquid nitrogen, using Invisorb Spin
Plant RNA Mini kit (Invitek) according to the protocol
of the manufacturer. Two other methods of RNA
extraction were evaluated (Qiagen Plant RNA easy kit
and Trizol), but the yields and DNA purity in our hands
were unsatisfactory (data not shown). RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDropTM
Spectrophotometer ND-1000 (Thermo Scientific), and
the integrity of RNA was also assessed by 1% agarose
gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The
presence of contaminant DNA in the RNA samples was
verified by PCR using primers spanning two exon and
gel electrophoresis analysis. No fragments of genomic
DNA were identified in all samples tested in this work
(data not shown). The presence of spurious product of
amplification caused by genomic DNA was also continuously checked by the verification of RT-qPCR dissociation profile. Both tests showed that the Invisorb Spin
Plant RNA Mini kit efficiently removed contaminant
DNA from the RNA samples. cDNAs were synthesized
by adding 50 μM of Oligo(dT24V) primer and 10 mM
of each deoxyribonucleoside 5’-triphosphate (dNTPs) to
1 μg of total RNA. This mixture was incubated at 65°C
for five minutes, and briefly chilled on ice. First Strand
Buffer, 20 mM of dithiothreitol (DTT) and 200 units of
Superscript III (Invitrogen) were added to the prior mixture and the total volume (20 μL) was incubated at 50°C
for 1 h following manufacturer’s instructions. Inactivation of the reverse transcriptase was done by incubating
the mixture at 70°C for 15 min and the cDNA solution
was stored at -20°C.

Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)

Eight of the nine putative cotton reference genes evaluated in this work, GhACT4 (actin gene family), GhEF1a5
(elongation factor 1-alpha), GhFBX6 (F-box family protein), GhPP2A1 (catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase
2A), GhMZA (clathrin adaptor complexes medium subunit family protein), GhPTB (polypyrimidine tract-binding
protein homolog), GhGAPC2 (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase C-2), GhbTUB3 (b-tubulin), were
selected according to their similarity to reference genes
identified in Arabidopsis (Table 1) [6]. The sequences of
possible G. hirsutum homologues were identified through
a BLASTN against the database of the Green plant GB
TAIR (The A. thaliana Information Resource, http://
www.arabidopsis.org/). Only sequences that showed similarity higher than 1e-75 (E-value) were considered as
putative homologous to the Arabidopsis genes and were
selected for primer design. We also selected the gene
encoding the poly-ubiquitin, GhUBQ14, commonly used
in cotton for experiments of Northern blots and RTqPCRs [26,27] (Table 1). Primers were designed with Primer 3 software [28] using as criterion amplified products
from 80 to 180 bp with a Tm of 60 ± 1°C (primer
sequences are shown in Table 1). Both candidate reference and MADS-box genes were amplified from cDNA.
Melting curve and gel electrophoresis analysis of the
amplification products confirmed that the primers amplified only a single product with expected size (data not
shown). Primer sets efficiencies were estimated for each
experimental set by Miner software [29], and the values
were used in all subsequent analysis (Table 2 and Additional file 2). Miner software pinpoints the starting and
ending points of PCR exponential phase from raw fluorescence data, and estimates primer set amplification efficiencies through a nonlinear regression algorithm
without the need of a standard curve.
Polymerase chain reactions were carried out in an optical 96-well plate with a Chromo4 Real time PCR Detector (BioRad) sequence detection system, using
SYBR®Green to monitor dsDNA synthesis. Reaction
mixtures contained 10 μL of diluted cDNA (1:50), 0.2
μM of each primer, 50 μM of each dNTP, 1× PCR Buffer (Invitrogen), 3 mM MgCl2, 2 μL of SYBR®Green I
(Molecular Probes) water diluted (1:10000), and 0.25
units of Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), in
a total volume of 20 μL. Reaction mixtures were incubated for five minutes at 94°C, followed by 40 amplification cycles of 15 s at 94°C, 10 s at 60°C and 15 s at 72°
C. PCR efficiencies and optimal quantification cycle
threshold (Cq values were estimated using the online
Real time PCR Miner tool [29]. For all reference and
MADS-box genes studied, two independent biological
samples of each experimental condition were evaluated
in technical triplicates.

Databases and procedures for searching Cotton MADSbox sequences

The primary data source for this work was clustered
gene sequences of the Cotton Genome Database (U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service CottonDB - http://www.cottondb.org.). In order to
search for MADS-box sequences, a MADS-box consensus sequence was used. This consensus was generated
by the COBBLER program (COnsensus Biasing By
Locally Embedding Residues, http://blocks.fhcrc.org/
blocks/cobbler.html) from all identified MADS-box
amino acid sequences “MGRKKIEIKRIENKTNRQVTFSKRRNGLFKKAHELSVLCDAEV ALIVFSPSGrlyeyannni” [30]. Searches were conducted using the
tBLASTN algorithm with the BLOSUM62 scoring
matrix [31]. All sequences that exhibit a significant
alignment (E-value of ≤ 7 × 10-13) with the consensus
were retrieved from Unigene http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/UniGene/UGOrg.cgi?TAXID=3635 in the Cotton
Genome Database http://cottondb.org/cdbhome.html.
All retrieved sequences were then re-inspected for
occurrence of MADS conserved motif using the InterProScan http://www.ebi.ac.uk/InterProScan/ and PRODOM http://prodom.prabi.fr/prodom/current/html/form.

php programs. Multiple alignments with complete
sequences or domains were conducted using the CLUSTALW program using default parameters and then
manually revised [32]. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using pairwise distance matrices for neighborjoining method [33] and p-distance on the Mega 4.1
program [34]. Assessment of node confidence was done
by means of 1,000 bootstrap replicates.
Analysis of gene expression stability

Expression levels of the nine housekeeping genes in all
the sample pools were determined by the number of
cycles (Cq) needed for the amplification related fluorescence to reach a specific threshold level of detection. Cq
values were converted in qBase software v1.3.5 [35] into
non-normalized relative quantities, corrected by PCR
efficiency, using the formula Q = EΔCq where E is the
efficiency of the gene amplification and ΔCq is the sample with the lowest expression in the data set minus the
Cq value of the sample in question. These quantities
were imported into geNorm v3.5 [1] and NormFinder
[12] analysis tools, which were used as described
in their manuals. Data of biological replicates were
analyzed separately in both programs.

Results
In order to compare the expression levels of target
genes in different tissues at the same time, it is crucial
to normalize all the samples by the same set of reference genes. For the evaluation of potential reference, a
well known housekeeping gene, poly-ubiquitin
(GhUBQ14), was included in the qPCR experiments
[26]. We selected eight new candidates to housekeeping
genes (GhACT4, GhEF1a5, GhFBX6, GhPP2A1,
GhMZA, GhPTB, GhGAPC2, GhbTUB3) in G. hirsutum.
These genes are putative homologues of eight Arabidopsis genes included in the list of 27 best reference genes
for qPCR analysis (Table 1) [6]. For the selection of the
putative cotton housekeeping genes, we searched in the
Cotton DB for homologues to the Arabidopsis referenced genes, only eight candidates that showed very
high similarities (E-value > 1e-75) were included in the
final list. The eight genes found in the cotton databanks
belong to different functional classes based on Arabidopsis sequence information, which reduce the chances
of co-regulated expression occurrence among these
genes (Table 1). The gene name, accession number, A.
thaliana homologue locus, A. thaliana annotation, similarity end identity, gene size, and primer sequence, are
provided in Table 1. The nine cotton candidate reference genes were evaluated for gene expression stability
by qPCR in a set of 23 cotton samples grouped into five
different experimental sets. The first experimental set
was composed of plant organs: leaves, stem, branch,
root, flower buds (RNA pools of stages 2 to 12 mm)
and fruits (RNA pools of stages 10 to 15 to fruits larger
than 30 mm). The second set included floral meristem
and size selected flower buds, based on their diameter
of 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12 mm. The third experimental
set was composed of the floral verticils: sepal, petal, stamen, carpel and pedicel. The fourth experimental set
consists of four stages of fruit development based on it
diameter: 10 to 15 (1), 16 to 20 (2), 21 to 30 (3) and larger than 30 mm (4). Finally, in the fifth set, we included
all the tissues samples used in this study (23 distinct
biological samples).
Total RNA was isolated from different tissue samples
and reverse transcribed. The RNA quality for all samples
was checked by gel eletrophoresis analisys and spectrophotometric assays (data not shown). Within a biological replicate, for a tissue sample, the same cDNA pool
was used for qPCR analysis of each of the nine genes
using gene-specific primers. qPCRs were performed in
triplicate for each of the 23 cDNA pools along with a
no template control in parallel for each gene. The melting-curve analysis performed by the PCR machine after
40 cycles of amplification and agarose gel electrophoresis showed that all the 9 primer pairs amplified a single

Page 6 of 12

PCR product of desired size from various cDNA (results
not shown). Primer efficiencies for all primer combinations were higher than 0.90 (90%) in all experimental
sets. Although, two primers pairs presented efficiencies
below 90% in four samples: GhGAPC2 in flower buds
and floral and plant organs and GhPP2A1 in floral
organs (Table 2). The mean Cq value (average of 6
values from the two biological replicates) in a tissue
sample for each gene is shown in Table 2. Cq values
were in the range of 15.30 and 29.17. GhACT4,
GhUBQ14 and GhEF1a5 are the top three most
expressed genes in all sets followed by GhMZA,
GhbTUB3, GhPP2A1 and GhPTB. GhFBX6 and
GhGAPC2 genes present the lowest expression levels in
all samples.
We used geNorm v3.5 software, to analyze the expression stability of the tested genes in all samples, and
ranked them accordingly to gene stability measure (M).
The M value is obtained by the use of relative expression values for each cDNA sample as input for the
geNorm algorithm based on the geometric averaging of
multiple control genes and mean pairwise variation of a
gene from all other control genes in a given set of samples. Therefore, genes with the lowest M values have
the most stable expression. The results obtained with
geNorm algorithm are presented in the Figure 1 and
summarized in Table 3. The geNorm algorithm also
determines the pairwise variation Vn/n + 1, which measures the effect of adding further reference genes on the
normalisation factor (that is calculated as the geometric
mean of the expression values of the selected reference
genes). It is advisable to add additional reference genes
to the normalisation factor until the added gene has no
significant effect. Vandesompele et al. (2002) used 0.15
as a cut-off value, below which the inclusion of an additional reference gene is not required. Pairwise variation
analysis (Figure 2) showed that the ideal number of
reference genes may be different for distinct set of samples. For instance, for the normalization of the floral
organ set, only two genes are necessary. On the other
hand, five genes are required for the normalization of
the plant organ set. When evaluating all the pairwise
variation, the least stable housekeeping gene was
GhGAPC2 followed by GhbTUB3 since they significantly
increased the pairwise variation during the whole assay
by increasing the V value as shown in Figure 2. However, Vandesompele and collaborators recommend the
use of at least three reference genes whenever this result
obtained in our analysis is observed [1].
In addition, to the analysis by geNorm we also evaluated the data with NormFinder algorithm (Table 4).
Differentially to geNorm, NormFinder takes into account
intra- and intergroup variations for normalization factor

(NF) calculations. When the outcome of geNorm and
NormFinder are compared few, but relevant, differences
are observed (Table 5). These discrepancies between the
results are expected since the geNorm and NormFinder
are based on distinct statistical algorithms.
To assess the validity of the procedure for the
selection of control genes detailed above, the relative
expression level of two cotton genes that belong to
MADS-box family were inspected. After the search in
Cotton db using the MADS-box consensus sequence, 18
ESTs were found with high similarity to MIKC MADS
box family (E-value ≤ 7 × 10-13) (Data not shown). The
reduced number of cotton MIKC type genes is expected
since the ESTs sequencing efforts in cotton are very limited when compared to other species such as Arabidopsis and rice. In spite of the low number of MADS-box
genes, the phylogenetic analysis identified good candidates to homologous genes of Arabidopsis AGAMOUS
(AG) and SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) (data not shown). The
homologue of AG, was previously characterized by RT-

PCR and named GhMADS3 [36]. RT-PCR analysis suggests that GhMADS3 expression is restricted to stamens
and carpels. Ectopic expression in Nicotiana tabacum L.
indicates that it is the cotton orthologous gene to AG
[36]. The Arabidopsis thaliana SEP3 is expressed in the
three inner whorls of organs throughout flower development, but there is no information of the putative homologue of cotton (GhSEP-like1), identified by our
phylogenetic analysis [37]. The expression of GhMADS3
and GhSEP-like1 was estimated in different plant organs,
during flower development and in the floral organs of 6
mm flower buds. The qPCR analysis employed the control genes recommended by NormFinder program for
the normalization of gene expression. The analysis
revealed that G. hirsutum GhMADS3 and GhSEP-like1
genes very similar expression profiles of AG and SEP3
genes from Arabidopsis (Figure 3). However, we also
observed unexpected expression patterns: GhSEP-like1 is
expressed in cotton fruits and the GhMADS3 in pedicels
of 6 mm flower buds.

Discussion
The qPCR is broadly accepted as the method of choice
for accurate and sensitive quantification of gene transcript levels, even for those genes whose transcript levels
are low. For valid qPCR analysis, accurate normalization
of gene expression against an appropriate internal control is required. The ideal control gene should have
similar expression regardless of experimental conditions,
including different cell types, developmental stages, and/
or sample treatment. However, no one gene has a stable
expression under every experimental condition, as
numerous studies reported that expression of housekeeping genes can also vary considerably with experimental
conditions. Consequently, normalization of gene expression with a single reference gene can trigger erroneous
data and, consequently, misinterpretation of experiment

results. Therefore, it is necessary to validate the expression stability of a control gene under specific experimental conditions prior to its use in qPCR normalization.
Normalisation with multiple reference genes is becoming the golden standard, but reports that identify such
genes in plant research are limited [3,4,17,18,38,39],
even though algorithms are available to test the expression stability of candidates [1,12,13] and a number of
candidate reference genes for Arabidopsis have been
proposed [6]. To obtain a solid basis for normalization
of our gene expression data when studying the flower
development in cotton, we evaluated the expression stability of nine candidate reference genes, including one
traditional “housekeeping” gene in five different experimental sets. Candidate genes were selected according to
the level of DNA sequence similarity to genes previously
identified as reference genes in Arabidopsis and cotton.
This strategy has been successful in finding good reference genes in other species such as grape [39] and it
was already employed by our group in coffee and B. brizantha [17,18]. Another strategy used to identify bona
fide qPCR reference genes is to check housekeeping
genes previously used in Northern and RT-PCR studies
[40,41]. However, it has be shown that the expression of
traditional reference genes may vary enormously
depending on the test condition [6]. In cotton, Tu and
collaborators tested six putative constitutive genes (Histone3, UBQ7, Actin, Cyclophilin, Gbpolyubiquitin-1 and
Gbpolyubiquitin-2), two of them (Gbpolyubiquitin-1 and
Gbpolyubiquitin-2) from previously published data [42].
In contrast to the present work, roots, floral stages and
verticils samples were not included in the final set of
samples [41]. The reference genes evaluation was performed using exclusively geNorm and the value obtained
for the pairwise variation with the best control genes
was above the cut-off value of 0.15 suggested by Vandesompele et al. [1]. Moreover, the expression in the fiber

developmental series of the all six putative reference
genes varied greatly, hampering their use for qPCR [41].
We elected the NormFinder as the preferential method
for the selection of the best references genes since it
considers intra- and inter-group variations for the normalization factor (NF). However, geNorm was also
important to compose the final set of references genes
for the experimental conditions tested in this work. Our
analysis has shown that each experimental condition
tested demands a specific set of reference genes (Table
3 and 4). This result emphasizes the importance of
reference genes validation for each experimental condition, especially when samples belong to very different
groups, e.g. different organs.
When plant organs and all samples were tested,
GhUBQ14 and GhPP2a1 were considered the most
appropriate reference genes. GhUBQ14 and GhPP2a1
should avoid error transferences since NormFinder
chose them as the best combination of genes. NormFinder chose GhACT4 and GhUBQ14 as the best combination of two genes in flower buds. Both programs ranked
GhACT4 as the most stable gene, conferring higher
robustness to the NF. Our analyses of different floral

organs revealed that GhACT4 and GhFBX6 are the most
appropriated genes for qPCR normalization, since they
represent the best combination of genes considered by
NormFinder to improve NF. GhFBX6 was ranked by
both algorithms as the most stable gene in the floral
organs set. Finally, fruit development GhMZA was considered as the most stable gene in both the NormFinder
and geNorm programs, and NormFinder chose GhMZA
and GhPTB as the best combination of genes.
The GhACT4, GhEF1a5, GhFBX6, GhPP2A1, GhMZA,
GhPTB, GhGAPC2, GhbTUB genes were identified as
novel reference genes in A. thaliana through microarray
experiments and were validated by qPCR [7]. Among
them, GhGAPC2 gave poor results in our analysis in
cotton. GhUBQ14, a traditional reference gene in cotton
[26] was well evaluated by NormFinder ranking in the
best combination in three of the five experimental sets.
Although, evaluations of a traditional reference genes by
the same procedures used in this work not always give
support to their frequent use. For instance, UBQ10 gene
shows highly stable expression in Arabidopsis [6]
whereas its putative homologue has been shown unsuitable for normalization of different tissues at different
developmental stages in rice and soybean [4,43].
Other commonly used housekeeping gene, GhbTUB,
displayed inappropriate expression variability limiting its
use as internal control in cotton. A similar result was
also observed for the b-tubulin of B. brizantha when
male and female reproductive tissues, spikelets, roots
and leaves were evaluated [17]. On the other hand,
b-TUB is one of most stably expressed genes in poplar
(Populus ssp) tissue samples among the 10 reference
genes tested [10]. GAPDH, another traditional reference

Artico et al. BMC Plant Biology 2010, 10:49
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2229/10/49

gene, was considered the most appropriate reference
gene when coffee leaves drought-stressed vs. control
plants and different coffee cultivar leaves were analyzed
[18]. Taken together, these results suggest that the
housekeeping genes are regulated differently in different
plant species and may exhibit differential expression patterns. This may partly be explained by the fact that
housekeeping genes are not only implicated in the basal
cell metabolism but also may participate in other cellular functions [11].
The programs employed to evaluate reference genes in
our study (geNorm and NormFinder) use the same input
data, i.e. non-normalized relative quantities, and Cqs
need to be transformed considering primer pair efficiencies. In our experience, it is crucial to evaluate primer
pair efficiencies for each sample tested since primer efficiency varies depend on the according to biological sample. The importance of this step can be well illustrated
by the primer efficiency variation of GhGACP2 in flower
buds compared to fruits (Table 2).
The values of Cq presented here should not be considered alone, but they may help in the selection of best
combination of reference genes when there is previous
data about target gene expression levels. Similar expression levels of the reference and target genes are considered an important issue regarding qPCR normalization
[1]. Indeed, references genes with excessively high/low
expression levels compared to target genes can trigger
problems for data analysis [44,45].
As suggested by Remans and collaborators [7], biological replicates were submitted to geNorm and NormFinder as independent samples. This procedure increased
the credibility of the most suitable cotton reference
genes because it takes into account possible variations
in reference gene expression that are not due to different treatments, but intrinsic to the gene itself.
To illustrate the suitability of the reference genes
revealed in the present study, two putative cotton
homologues to AG and SEP3 (GhMADS3 and GhSEPlike1) had their expression profile evaluated in different
plant organs, during flower development and in floral
organs at flower buds of 6 mm (Figure 3). As it is
observed to AG and SEP3, the GhMADS3 and GhSEPlike1 genes are highly expressed in flower buds, but
GhSEP-like1 also shows a high expression in fruits.
GhMADS3 also is expressed in higher levels after stage
of 2 mm and throughout cotton flower development.
The low expression of GhMADS3 in floral meristem is
expected as well a high expression level in stamen and
carpels of 6 mm flower bud. The AG gene is expressed
in few cells during the initial flower development to
establish organ identity and is also important at later
stages of stamens and carpels development [46,47]. The
GhMADS3 expression observed in pedicels may be the

development (b) and in the floral organs (c). Cq and
amplification efficiency values were processed with the qBase
software. Normalization was performed using the best combination
of reference genes recommended by NormFinder program to each
experimental set. The combination of GhUBQ14 and GhPP2A1 were
used as internal control for plant organs (a), GhACT4 and GhUBQ14
for flower buds (b) and GhACT4 and GhFBX6 for floral organs (c).

result of contamination of material derived from carpels.
These two organs are merged, which hamper a perfect
separation during flower bud dissection to collect the
samples. Our analysis of GhMADS3 expression by RTqPCR refined the information of the previous study adding accuracy, spatial and temporal information to the
expression during floral development [36]. In addition,
it revealed that this GhMADS3 is also expressed in cotton fruits (Figure 3).
The high expression in fruits of GhSEP-like1 contrast
to the spatial and developmental expression pattern of
SEP3 in Arabidopsis, former AGL9 (Figure 3) [37]. SEP3
is expressed in all Arabidopsis flower verticils throughout development but no transcripts are found in siliques. However, PPERSEP3, a putative Prunus persica
homologue of SEP3, is expressed during fruit development [48]. In addition, GhMADS4 and GhMADS7,
genes from AGAMOUS subclass in cotton, are also
expressed during fiber development [23]. Taking
together, these results suggest that besides flower identity SEP3 and AG-like genes in cotton may be involved
in an additional developmental process during fruit
development.

Conclusion
This work constitutes the first in-depth study to validate
the optimal control genes for the quantification of transcript levels in different cotton organs and during flower
and fruit development. The use of the new cotton reference genes combined with size collected flower buds
and floral organ dissection allowed a precise spatial and
temporal characterization of two MADS-box genes in
cotton plants. In summary, the new cotton reference
genes will enable more accurate and reliable normalization of qPCR results for gene expression studies in this
important crop plant.

used in this study with the respective major biological events
observed. We prepared paraffin transverse sections of cotton flower
buds in order to visualize the changes that occurred at the cellular level.
Additional file 2: Values of efficiency ± standard deviation (SD) of
the primers and average values of quantification cycle (Cq) ±
standard deviation (SD) of biological replicates generated by the
Miner to the MADS-box genes of G. hirsutum. The values of efficiency
of primers were generated for each experimental situation (A-plant
organs, B-flower buds and C-floral organs).
