Abstract
Dementia is a clinical state characterized by loss of function in multiple cognitive domains. It is a
costly disease in terms of both personal suffering and economic loss. Frontotemporal dementia
(FTD) is the term now preferred over Picks disease to describe the spectrum of non-Alzheimers
dementias characterized by focal atrophy of the frontal and anterior temporal regions of the brain.
The prevalence of FTD is considerable, though specific figures vary among different studies. It
occurs usually in an age range of 35–75 and it is more common in individuals with a positive family
history of dementia. The risk factors associated with this disorder include head injury and family
history of FTD. Although there is some controversy regarding the further syndromatic subdivision
of the different types of FTD, the three major clinical presentations of FTD include: 1) a frontal or
behavioral variant (FvFTD), 2) a temporal, aphasic variant, also called Semantic dementia (SD), and
3) a progressive aphasia (PA). These different variants differ in their clinical presentation, cognitive
deficits, and affected brain regions. Patients with FTD should have a neuropsychiatric assessment,
neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging studies to confirm and clarify the diagnosis.
Treatment for this entity consists of behavioral and pharmacological approaches. Medications such
as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antipsychotics, mood stabilizer and other novel treatments have
been used in FTD with different rates of success. Further research should be directed at
understanding and developing new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities to improve the patients'
prognosis and quality of life.

Background
Dementia is a clinical state characterized by the loss of
function in multiple cognitive domains. It is a costly disease in terms of both personal suffering and economic
loss. Hence, an understanding of its prevalence, risk factors, prompt diagnosis methods and potential interventions is critical [1]. In terms of frontotemporal dementia,
it has been more than 110 years since Arnold Pick
described the first of a series of cases, which separated
focal atrophies from what was at that time called senile
atrophy. The eponym "Pick's disease" was suggested by a

pupil of Pick who had thought that the frontal and temporal lobes, seen as phylogenetically younger, were more
vulnerable to degenerative disease. Later, pathologists
began restricting the use of the term 'Pick's' disease to refer
only to the pathologic finding of Pick's bodies. This created the impression that Pick's disease was rare and difficult to diagnose [2]. Over time, when physicians began
encountering patients with frontal degeneration and personality change (disinhibition), they would often diagnose it as Pick's disease. However, subsequently, these
patients were rarely found to have actual Pick's bodies [3].

The term is now used to describe what has been discovered to be a host of related neurodegenerative conditions.
These conditions are characterized by disturbances in
behavior or language. Unfortunately, there is considerable
confusion in the literature regarding FTD because authors
have used different nomenclature to describe similar clinical entities and because symptoms of FTD are related to
the anatomical areas affected rather than to precise neuropathological entities. Further complicating matters is
that FTD, refers to both the overall name of this group of
diseases and to the clinical subgroup mainly affecting the
frontal lobes, i.e. frontal-variant FTD [3]. Despite this
overlap, the division of FTD into three main subgroups
has been widely accepted. These include the frontal-variant or behavioral-variant (fvFTD also just called FTD);
progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA); and semantic
dementia (SD). The motor syndromes of corticobasal
degeneration (CBD); progressive supranuclear palsy
(PSP); and motor neuron disease may also be associated
with features of FTD and its pathology. Because of this
association, they have been included as part of the same
spectrum of disorders [4]. Of note, other authors have
suggested the terms Pick complex [5] or dysexecutive syndrome [6] be incorporated instead.
FTD has an heterogenous pathology. The pathological
profile is characterized by gliosis, neuronal loss, and
superficial spongiform degeneration in the frontal and/or
temporal cortexes. Ballooned neurons, i.e. Pick cells,
occur with variable frequency in all subtypes [7]. Further,
the fact that tau-inclusions have been confirmed in FTD,
CBD and PSP have made some authors indicate that the
pathology of FTD should be divided into tau-positive and
tau-negative variations and that the clinical picture only
differs, again, because of the affected brain regions [8,9].
This article reviews recent literature on FTD's epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, neuropathology, and
treatments.
2. Epidemiology
Two recent studies have addressed the prevalence of FTD.
Ratnavalli et al., reported a prevalence of 15 per 100,000
in a population between 45 and 64 years of age [10],
while Rosso et al., [11] who studied the prevalence of FTD
in the Netherlands, reported an overall prevalence of FTD
of 1.1 in 100,000 with a maximum prevalence of 9.4 per
100,000 for ages 60–69. Overall, FTD is estimated to
account for 20% of cases of degenerative dementia with
presenile onset [12]. Post-mortem investigations have
reported a relative frequency of FTD of 3–10% [9].

Frontotemporal dementia usually affects people in the age
range of 35–75 years. Among these patients, about 20–
40% have a positive family history for FTD [13]. Two

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/6/1/15

recent studies have reported that the incidence rates for
FTD (new cases per 100,000 person-years) were 2.2 for
ages 40 to 49 years, 3.3 for ages 50 to 59 years, and 8.9 for
ages 60 to 69 years. In comparison, the corresponding
rates for Alzheimer disease were 0.0, 3.3, and 88.9 years
respectively [14,15]. Although the age of onset tends to be
younger than in patients with AD, it doesn't seem to vary
between familial and sporadic cases [16]. The median age
of onset of FTD is about 58 with 22% of the patients having an age of onset after age 65.7.
In a recent study by Hodges et al., median survival from
symptom onset was found to be 6 +/- 1.1 years for FTD
and 3 +/- 0.4 years for FTD-MND. The median survival for
the entire group was 3.0 years from the time of diagnosis,
and 75% were dead within 6.0 years. This short survival
was attributable partly to delayed diagnosis; on average,
3.0 years elapsed between symptom onset and diagnosis.
However, one of the group's most striking findings was
that the institutionalization occurred on an average of
only 1.0 year after the diagnosis was made [17]. In further
support of this finding, Roberson et al reported that FTD
progresses faster than Alzheimer's disease (AD). Survival
from presentation was estimated to be 5.7 years, in comparison to 11.7 years in patients with AD. Some of the factors associated with a decreased survival in FTD included
the presence of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), specific degeneration of frontal-subcortical circuits, and taunegative cases. They also found that patients with semantic dementia (SD) had significantly longer survival compared to other subsets of FTD [18].
3. Risk Factors
Few studies have reported on specific risk factors for FTD.
Recognized risk factors include family history of FTD and
a personal history of head trauma. A case-control study
that included 80 cases of sporadic FTD reported a significant association between FTD and head trauma. There was
also a positive association between thyroid disease and
the risk of FTD. Specifically, thyroid disease was associated with a 2.5 times increased risk of frontotemporal
dementia. This was not statistically significant (p = 0.09),
though, owing to limited power of this study[19].
4. Clinical presentation
FTD results in behavioral, cognitive and neurological
changes. These three major clinical presentations are
described below. Generally, in terms of behavioral alterations, patients often tend to lack appropriate basic and
social emotions. Some patients with FTD present with disinhibition and overactivity, while others show apathy and
blunted affect [20]. Some behavioral abnormalities seen
in patients with FTD have been compared to those presented by patients with antisocial personality disorder.
Functional imaging studies have shown abnormalities in

individuals with acquired sociopathy that involve the
same areas affected in FTD. These include the anterior
temporal lobes and ventromedial frontal and orbitofrontal cortex [21]. It has also been suggested that these
patients suffer from "moral agnosia", which could be
related to an inability to differentiate right from wrong or
from the loss of the capacity to reason [22].
Patients with FTD show marked deficiencies in executive
functioning and working memory [20]. Other frequently
encountered cognitive abnormalities include deficits in
attention, poor abstraction, difficulty shifting mental set,
and perseveration [12]. Interestingly, spatial skills seem to
remain unaffected in such patients [20].
Neurological signs are usually absent early in the disease,
although patients may display primitive reflexes. With
disease progression, patients develop parkinsonian signs
of akinesia and rigidity, which can be prominent. They
may also have repetitive motor behaviors and muscular
rigidity [20]. A minority of patients develops neurological
signs consistent with motor neuron disease [23].
The symptoms of FTD reflect the distribution of the pathological changes rather than the precise histological subtype. The degree of frontal vs. temporal pathology can
account for additional variability in the presenting symptoms of FTD [24]. Complicating matters further, patients
may initially present with symptoms consistent with one
particular FTD syndrome but then progress to a different
FTD subtype [25].
The three major clinical presentations of FTD include: 1)
a frontal or behavioral variant (FvFTD), 2) a temporal,
aphasic variant, also called Semantic dementia (SD), and
3) a progressive aphasia (PA). Table 1 summarizes the dif-

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/6/1/15

ferences in clinical presentation, cognitive deficits, and
affected brain regions of the three variants.
A. Frontal Variant FTD (FvFTD)
FvFTD is characterized by the insidious onset of personality changes, behavioral abnormalities and poor insight.
The division of frontal lobe function into three separate
areas (orbitobasal, medial, and dorsolateral) offers a way
to understand the clinical presentation of FvFTD. Orbitobasal involvment leads to some of the most common
symptoms encountered in this disorder. These include
disinhibition, poor impulse control, antisocial behavior,
and stereotypical behaviors. Examples of stereotypical, or
ritualized behaviors, include insisting on eating the same
food at exactly the same time daily, cleaning the house in
precisely the same order, or simple repetitive behaviors
such as foot-tapping. Ritualized acts may also include the
use of a "catch-phrase" and a change in food preference
[26]. A patient's decline in social conduct can include
breaches of interpersonal etiquette and tactlessness. Verbally inappropriate sexual comments and gestures are
common [27].

Apathy is correlated with the severity of medial frontalanterior cingulate involvement [26]. Dietary changes are
frequent and typically take the form of overeating, i.e.
hyperorality, with a preference for sweet foods [26].
Patients also exhibit emotional blunting. Speech output is
attenuated and mutism eventually develops. Echolalia
and perseveration may be present.
The most common cognitive deficit in FvFTD is an impairment of executive function or working memory [27],
which is indicative of frontal and prefrontal cortex
involvement. Other frequently encountered cognitive
abnormalities include attentional deficits, poor abstraction, difficulty shifting mental set, and perseverative ten-

dencies [12]. Deficits in planning, organization, and other
aspects of executive function become universal as the disease progresses, and this reflects the involvement of the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [26].
Within the clinical subtypes of FvFTD, there is marked
heterogeneity of clinical presentations, often as a result of
differential involvement of brain regions. Some patients
are disinhibited, fatuous, purposelessly overactive, easily
distracted, socially inappropriate, and lacking in concern.
At the other extreme, others are bland, apathetic, inert,
lacking volition, mentally rigid, and perseverative [12].
Social behavior has been shown to be more disrupted in
patients with predominantly right-hemisphere pathology
[23]. Moreover, Mc Murtray., [24] demonstrated that
patients with frontal FTD showed hypoactivity and apathy, whereas patients with temporal FTD showed hypomania-like behavior. Decreased insight was associated
with right frontal hypoperfusion, while decreased hygiene
and grooming with left frontal hypoperfusion. Patients
with left hemisphere FTD had early speech and language
difficulty but greater normal behavior, whereas patients
with right hemisphere FTD had normal speech and language but more frequent inappropriate behavior [24].
B. Semantic Dementia (SD)
Temporal FTD, also known as semantic dementia (SD), is
associated with bilateral atrophy of the middle and inferior temporal neocortex [20]. The most common initial
presentation in these patients is an abnormality of language, which includes loss of memory for words or a loss
of word meaning [27]. Patients with SD are often unaware
of their difficulties with comprehension. Speech is fluent,
but patients tend to use substitute phrases such as "thing"
or "that" [27]. Patients lose the ability to name and understand words and to recognize the significance of faces,
objects and other sensory stimuli. They also show deficits
on non-verbal tasks using visual, auditory, and other
modalities, suggesting that the key impairment in SD is a
breakdown in conceptual knowledge rather than a specific
problem with language. Working memory and autobiographical memory, at least for the recent past, tend to be
preserved. However, patients with SD perform poorly on
standard anterograde verbal memory tests, such as wordlist learning [28].

Behavioral symptoms may occur early or late in the clinical course. Patients with SD may present as less apathetic
and more compulsive than those with FvFTD [27]. They
may show interpersonal coldness and impairments in
emotional processing. Patients with more marked right
temporal lobe involvement tend to present with significant changes in personality, such as emotional disturbances, bizarre alterations in dress, and limited, fixed
ideas [24].

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/6/1/15

Snowden et al., compared behavioral patterns and functional imaging in patients with FTD to those with SD.
Whereas lack of emotional responsiveness was pervasive
in FTD, it was often more selective in semantic dementia
and particularly affected the capacity to show fear. Apathetic FTD patients also had a higher pain threshold,
whereas patients with SD had an exaggerated response to
pain. Overall, emotional, repetitive, and compulsive
behaviors discriminated FTD from SD with an accuracy of
97% [12].
C. Progressive aphasia (PNFA)
Progressive non-fluent aphasia (PNFA) is a disorder predominantly of expressive language, in which severe problems in word retrieval occur in the context of preserved
word comprehension. This disorder is associated with
asymmetric atrophy of the left hemisphere [20]. Patients
present with changes in fluency, pronunciation, or word
finding difficulty. They do not present with behavioral
problems until later in the disease [27]. In a study that
assessed discourse in patients with both semantic dementia and PNFA, patients with PNFA had the sparsest output
producing narratives and had the fewest words per minute
[29].
5. Diagnosis
Patients with FTD should have a neuropsychiatric assessment, neuropsychological testing and neuroimaging studies to clarify the diagnosis. On neuropsychological testing,
memory is relatively spared. Orientation and recall of
recent personal events is good, but performance on anterograde memory tests can be variable. Patients tend to do
poorly on recall-based tasks. A reduction in spontaneous
conversation is common. Subjects also perform well on
visuospatial tests, when the organizational aspects are
minimized. The Folstein Mini Mental State Examination
(MMSE) is unreliable for the detection and monitoring of
patients with FTD, who frequently perform normally even
when requiring nursing home care [26].

There have been several different classifications proposed
to make the clinical diagnosis of FTD. The Lund and Manchester Group [30] initially established diagnostic criteria
for FTD in 1994. Patients were required to present with at
least two of the following signs or symptoms: loss of personal awareness, strange eating habits, perseveration or
changes in mood. In addition, they had to have one of the
following features: frontal executive dysfunction, reduced
speech, or normal visuospatial ability.
Neary et al. [31] developed another set of diagnostic criteria, and specifically divided FTD into three prototypic syndromes. They have been delineated above as frontalvariant FTD, semantic dementia, and progressive non-fluent aphasia. McKhann et al., have sought to further define

Page 4 of 10
(page number not for citation purposes)

Annals of General Psychiatry 2007, 6:15

clinical criteria for FTD that can be easily used by clinicians in order to make a prompt diagnosis of FTD [13].
They proposed the following criteria for FTD:
1. The development of behavioral or cognitive deficits
manifested by either
a. Early and progressive change in personality, characterized by difficulty in modulating behavior, often resulting
in inappropriate responses or activities or
b. Early and progressive change in language, characterized
by problems with expression of language or severe naming difficulty and problems with word meaning.
2. The deficits outlined in 1a or 1b cause significant
impairment in social or occupational functioning and
represent a significant decline from a previous level of
functioning.
3. The course is characterized by a gradual onset and continuing decline in function.
4. The deficits outlined in 1a or 1b are not due to other
nervous system conditions (e.g., cerebrovascular accident), systemic conditions or SA induced conditions.
5. The deficits do not occur exclusively during a delirium.
6. The disturbance is not better accounted for by another
psychiatric diagnosis.
Neuroimaging can also be helpful in distinguishing FTD
from other types of cognitive disorders. Typically, structural imaging shows anterior temporal and frontal atrophy, while functional imaging shows decreased perfusion
of both frontal and temporal lobes [32]. MRI scans indicate that both PNFA and FvFTD show frontotemporal
atrophy. The focus of the atrophy is in the left temporal
lobe in PNFA patients and in both frontal lobes in FvFTD
patients. In contrast, the mesial temporal lobes are
atrophic in AD patients [33]. Imaging abnormalities in
FvFTD usually appear later in the disease course. TcHMPAO-SPECT scanning can detect hypoperfusion in the
ventromedial frontal region even before atrophy is evident. In the later stages of the disease, atrophy of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes becomes more apparent
[26]. According to a recent report studying SPECT differences in FTD patients with different symptoms, patients
with right frontal involvement meet the consensus criteria
more frequently than patients with greater involvement in
other areas.
Neurochemical changes in the behavioral presentation of
FTD contrast with those of AD. There is evidence of less

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/6/1/15

cholinergic deficit and more serotonergic disturbance in
FTD than in AD. In fact, acetylcholinesterase and cholinergic acetyltransferase activities are well preserved in FTD.
Serotonin dysfunction is linked with impulsivity, irritability, affective change, and changes in eating behavior.
These are all common features of FTD. Additionally, the
serotonergic system is associated with the frontal lobes,
which are often affected in FTD. Using functional imaging, serotonin binding has been shown to be reduced in
the frontal cortex in FTD. Thus, FTD has been described as
mainly a post-synaptic pathology. Monoaminergic and
dopaminergic alterations have also been reported in the
literature [34].
6. Differential diagnosis
The differential diagnosis for FTD is broad. Some conditions that need to be considered in the differential diagnosis, include illnesses, that cause both cognitive and
behavioral deficits, such as stroke, Parkinson's disease,
Huntington's disease, hypothyroidism, HIV and substance abuse (primarily alcohol) [32]. FTD also overlaps
with other neurodegenerative diseases, such as motor
neuron disease, corticobasal degeneration and progressive
supranuclear palsy [27].

FTD is most often mistaken for AD; indeed, many patients
with pathologically confirmed FTD have been diagnosed
with Alzheimer's disease during life. In a study by Miller
et al., FTD was best differentiated from AD by using
behavioral criteria such as early loss of social awareness,
early loss of personal awareness, hyperorality, progressive
loss of speech, and stereotyped and perseverative behaviors. Using these standards, the sensitivity for detecting
FTD was 63.3% to 73.3% and specificity was 96.7% to
100% [35]. For a quantitative measure to distinguish
between the two conditions, the Frontal Behavioral Inventory (FBI) has been developed by Kertesz et al. [36]. The
FBI is a 24-item caregiver-based behavioral questionnaire
designed for the diagnosis and quantification of FTD
symptoms. Cognitive tests like the MMSE do not readily
distinguish between FTD and AD. On the other hand, the
FBI differentiated 98% of FTD and AD patients. The FBI
tests areas such as apathy, aspontaneity, indifference,
inflexibility, concreteness, personal neglect, disorganization, inattention, loss of insight, logopenia, verbal
apraxia, perseveration, irritability, excessive jocularity,
poor judgment, inappropriateness, impulsivity, restlessness, aggression, hyperorality, hypersexuality, utilization
behavior, incontinence, and alien hand5. Another study
reported that, compared to patients with AD, patients
with FTD tended to develop symptoms at an earlier age,
develop behavioral symptoms earlier in the course of their
illness, and have less prominent memory loss. In addition, patients with FTD commonly present with motor
abnormalities, which are not common in AD [32].

Annals of General Psychiatry 2007, 6:15

In 2002, Rascovsky et al. compared patterns of cognitive
deficits between patients with autopsy-confirmed FTD
and AD. They found that patients with FTD were more
impaired than patients with AD on word-generation tasks
such as letter fluency and category fluency. Conversely,
patients with AD were more impaired than patients with
FTD on memory tasks and visuospatial tasks such as block
design and clock drawing [37]. Although similar findings
have been reported in the literature [38-42] there is an
overall lack of consistent findings in studies attempting to
differentiate the cognitive profiles of FTD and AD. Possible reasons for the inconsistencies include improper
matching of FTD and AD populations (i.e., comparing
pa444etients at different stages of dementia); choice of
neuropsychological test; and lack of pathologically-confirmed diagnoses [37].
7. Neuropathology
The typical changes seen in FTD are atrophy of the prefrontal and anterior temporal neocortex. Routine histology shows microvacuolation of the outer cortical laminae
due to large neuronal cell loss, or transcortical gliosis [20].
Pathologically, FTD is heterogeneous; some cases may
show tau- or ubiquitin- positive inclusions, or they may
lack distinctive histological features [43]. Sensitive methods for detecting tau abnormalities and for ubiquitin are
essential in the neuropathological evaluation of FTD [13].

Tau-protein is involved in the regulation of microtubule
assembly and disassembly. For hereditary FTD, more than
50 different tau mutations have been identified in several
families. Although the frequency of tau mutations in sporadic FTD is low, in patients with a family history of FTD
the frequency of tau mutations ranges from 9.4 to 10.5%.
These tau abnormalities may lead to aggregation or to disruption of microtubules, which in turn affects the
intraneuronal transport system [44].
Kertesz et al. followed 60 patients who met criteria for
behavioral variants of FTD to autopsy. They reported that
the most common histological variety was motor neuron
disease type inclusion, followed by corticobasal degeneration, Pick's disease, dementia lacking distinctive histopathology, and progressive supranuclear palsy. They also
reported that tau-negative patients had an earlier age of
onset [25].
Forman et al., studied whether specific clinical features in
patients with FTD predict the underlying pathology in 90
patients with a pathological diagnosis of FTD. They
reported that taupathies were more frequently associated
with an extrapyramidal disorder, whereas patients with
ubiquitin-positive inclusions were more likely to present
with social and language dysfunction as well as with
motor neuron disorder [45].

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/6/1/15

In 2001, an international group of scientists reassessed
neuropathological criteria for the diagnosis of FTD. They
recommended classifying neurodegenerative disorders
associated with FTD into five distinct neuropathological
categories, based on presence or absence of tau-positive
and ubiquitin-positive inclusions, predominance of
microtubule-binding repeats in insoluble tau, and presence of motor neuron disease-type inclusions. However,
they emphasized that only probabilistic statements could
be made when examining the causal relationship between
neuropathological findings and clinical manifestations of
neurodegenerative disorders, as it is unclear exactly how
neurodegenerative diseases cause specific clinical syndromes [13].
8. Treatments
A. Non-pharmacological Treatments
The behavioral approach to treating FTD is a challenging
matter for most clinicians. Livingston et al., conducted a
systematic review of different psychological treatments
available for the behavioral disturbances of dementia.
Although this review was not specific to FTD and included
studies on patients with other types of dementia, the
results were noteworthy given the paucity of high-quality
research in this area. They concluded that approaches with
positive evidence to support them included techniques
centered on individual patient behavior, and that psychoeducation intended to change caregiver's behavior could
have an effect on the patient's neuropsychiatric symptoms
lasting several months [46]. There is clearly a need for further studies to evaluate the efficacy of non-pharmacological approaches to the management of behavioral
disturbances of dementia, particularly in patients with
FTD.

In her review, Litvan., addressed the dilemma of caregiver
burden in FTD. Although there have been no published
studies of caregiver burden in FTD, she concluded the
findings would likely be similar to studies with AD. Caregiver perception of burden is strongly correlated with distress and is related to earlier nursing home placement of
patients. Caregiver distress is also associated with
increased health care disturbances, needs, and costs for
the provider. Caregiver burden is linked to decreased
immunity and consequently increased vulnerability to
infection. Social support has been shown to not only
decrease caregiver stress but also to lower anxiety and promote better immune response. Therefore, it is important
to provide support, education, and treatment to providers. Studies have suggested that early caregiver intervention may delay patient institutionalization and improve
the quality of life for both the patient and caregiver [47].
Unfortunately, many FTD patients eventually require
long-term placement. No standard method of structuring

Page 6 of 10

Annals of General Psychiatry 2007, 6:15

the transition to a long-term facility has been studied in
this population. Such a change in environment may result
in increasing disorganization, irritability, and agitation.
However, patients with dementia do not uniformly
respond to stress in the same way; hence, it may be best to
consider an individualized approach to this transition.
Patients at risk for elopement may require the use of a
secure unit or "wanderguards." Patients with impairments
in language may benefit from alternative means of communication, including careful attention to body language.
In a few rare cases, patients have been transferred to secure
units for medication management until stabilized [48].
B. Pharmacological Treatments
Table 2 summarizes the various studies of pharmacologic
treatments in FTD. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) have been used with some degree of success
in patients with FTD. Studies of these medications in this
population have shown an effect on behavior but not on
cognition [49]. Some studies have demonstrated deficiencies of serotonin in patients with FTD. Further, the anatomic and clinical presentation of this illness may
correspond with serotonergic dysfunction (e.g. aggression
and impulsiveness) [49]. Unfortunately, there have been
few large-scale clinical trials published to date. Swartz et
al., enrolled 11 patients with FTD in a three-month, openlabel trial with the SSRIs sertraline, paroxetine, and fluoxetine. After 3 months of treatment, 9 of 11 subjects (82%)
showed improvement in at least one of the following

http://www.annals-general-psychiatry.com/content/6/1/15

behavioral symptoms: disinhibition, depressive symptoms, carbohydrate craving, or compulsions. No subjects
showed worsening of symptoms [50]. An open label,
uncontrolled trial with paroxetine had good results as
well. In this study, up to 20 mg/day was given to 8 patients
with FTD. At 14 months, the subjects demonstrated an
improvement in behavioral symptoms. This was coupled
with decreased caregiver distress. Baseline scores of global
performance, cognition, and planning remained stable,
but there was a decrease in attention and abstract reasoning. Side effects were tolerable, and there were no dropouts [51]. Recently, a randomized placebo controlled trial
with paroxetine was completed. Ten patients were given
up to 40 mg/day and treatment assessments were done at
the 6th or 7th week. Patients were found to have had no
improvement on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) or
the Cambridge Behavioral Inventory (CBI). Furthermore,
subjects actually demonstrated increased error rates on
the reversal component of the visual discrimination task,
the paired associates learning task, and delayed pattern
recognition task. Interestingly, these three tasks have been
shown previously to be sensitive to tryptophan depletion
[52]. Ikeda et al., studied the reaction to fluvoxamine of
16 patients diagnosed with FTD in an open 12-week trial
and reported a response in behavioral symptoms, especially stereotyped behaviors [53].
Lebert and Pasquier, evaluated 14 subjects with FTD
treated with trazodone, an atypical serotonergic agent.

Trazodone's activity is mainly based on post-synaptic 5HTa/2c antagonist effects. It has a 5-HT1a agonist effect by
its metabolite and has modest selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor effects. Essentially, trazodone increases
extracellular 5-HT levels in the frontal cortex. In the trial,
the patients were treated for 6 weeks. They received 150
mg/day for the first 4 weeks and 300 mg/day during the
final 2 weeks. All of the patients showed a dose-dependent improvement in behavioral symptoms. After 4 weeks,
they exhibited decreased delusions, aggression, anxiety,
and irritability. Six weeks of treatment resulted in additional decreases in depression, disinhibition, and aberrant
motor behavior [54]. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study with trazodone in FTD
was completed in 2004. Twenty-six patients were evaluated using the NPI. A significant decrease (p = 0.028) of
more than 50% in the NPI score was observed in 10 of the
patients on trazodone. Overall, a decrease of over 25% in
the total score for behavioral disturbances was seen in
61% of the FTD patients. The improvement was mainly
seen in irritability, agitation, depressive symptoms, and
eating disorders. Trazodone was generally well tolerated
[34]. These same authors completed an open-label extension of the trazodone trial for two years following the end
of the double-blind trial. They reported improved behavioral symptoms and significantly (p = 0.028) improved
score on the NPI. Cognition was less impacted, as 9/16
patients had a decrease in MMSE score of greater than
three points, while 7/16 patients had either no change or
only minor decrease in MMSE score. Hypotension was
reported as the single adverse effect (15% patients) [55].

old woman with Pick's disease treated with risperidone
[58]. Some authors maintain that patients with FTD are
especially sensitive to extrapyramidal side effects of neuroleptics. Pijnenburg et al studied the appearance of
extrapyramidal side effects in 100 patients with FTD and
found that around 33% of patients treated with neuroleptics developed these side effects. They also reported that in
some instances it took several weeks for the EPS to resolve
[59]. The safety and efficacy of antipsychotics in FTD
needs to be thoroughly studied in order to establish if they
are of value in the treatment of these patients.

Dopamine use for the treatment of FTD is controversial.
In practice, behavioral disturbances are occasionally managed by D2 blockers, but it is possible that patients may
benefit more from treatment with selective dopamine
agonists. Recent studies have proposed that bromocriptine, a D1 and D2 dopaminergic agonist, may improve
selective frontal features. An open label study suggested
that bromocriptine improved perseveration in dementia
[56]. A case report using methylphenidate and quantitative EEG correlated with SPECT demonstrated that profound left greater than right bi-frontotemporal slowing
partially normalized after methylphenidate administration. This finding occurred in the context of significant
behavioral improvement in the patient [57].

9. Conclusion

The use of neuroleptics for the treatment of agitation in
dementia is controversial. The FDA recently determined
that the use of atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of
behavioral disorders in elderly patients with dementia is
associated with a higher mortality than treatment with
placebo, specifically due to cardiac-related events and
infections [48]. One case reported an improvement in
psychotic symptoms and social interactions in a 42 -year

Regarding cognitive enhancers, Moretti et al., studied the
effect of rivastigmine, an acetylcholinesterase and bytyrylcholinesterase inhibitor, in 20 patients with FTD for 12
months. They found a general amelioration of behavioral
changes and reduced caregiver burden, although they did
not find any differences in the progression of cognitive
impairment as measured by the MMSE [60].
Pathological tau proteins are biochemical markers found
in various degenerative dementias, including several subtypes of FTD. Tau mutations, though, have only been discovered in autosomal dominant FTDP-17. Novel
therapeutics will likely focus on targets linked to disease
pathogenesis, which are likely to be different for each FTD
subtype. Agents that prevent the expression or accumulation of tau represent a future direction of therapy. So far,
lithium has been shown to decrease tau phosphorylation
and aggregation in transgenic mice [61], but lithium is
generally poorly tolerated in the elderly.

FTD is a common and severe neurodegenerative disorder,
which has drawn a lot of attention among the medical
community in the last decade. FTD is estimated to account
for 20% of cases of degenerative dementia with presenile
onset [12], and post-mortem investigations have reported
a relative frequency of FTD of 3–10% [44]. Its pathophysiology is still unclear, and further research should be
directed at understanding and developing new diagnostic
and therapeutic modalities to improve patients' prognosis
and quality of life.
