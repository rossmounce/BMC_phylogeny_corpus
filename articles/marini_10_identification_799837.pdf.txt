Abstract
Background: Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Eukaryota, Fungi, Ascomycota) is a thermodimorphic fungus, the
etiological agent of paracoccidioidomycosis, the most important systemic mycoses in Latin America. Three isolates
corresponding to distinct phylogenetic lineages of the Paracoccidioides species complex had their genomes
sequenced. In this study the identification and characterization of class II transposable elements in the genomes of
these fungi was carried out.
Results: A genomic survey for DNA transposons in the sequence assemblies of Paracoccidioides, a genus recently
proposed to encompass species P. brasiliensis (harboring phylogenetic lineages S1, PS2, PS3) and P. lutzii (Pb01-like
isolates), has been completed. Eight new Tc1/mariner families, referred to as Trem (Transposable element mariner),
labeled A through H were identified. Elements from each family have 65-80% sequence similarity with other Tc1/
mariner elements. They are flanked by 2-bp TA target site duplications and different termini. Encoded DDDtransposases, some of which have complete ORFs, indicated that they could be functionally active. The distribution
of Trem elements varied between the genomic sequences characterized as belonging to P. brasiliensis (S1 and PS2)
and P. lutzii. TremC and H elements would have been present in a hypothetical ancestor common to P. brasiliensis
and P. lutzii, while TremA, B and F elements were either acquired by P. brasiliensis or lost by P. lutzii after speciation.
Although TremD and TremE share about 70% similarity, they are specific to P. brasiliensis and P. lutzii, respectively.
This suggests that these elements could either have been present in a hypothetical common ancestor and have
evolved divergently after the split between P. brasiliensis and P. Lutzii, or have been independently acquired by
horizontal transfer.
Conclusions: New families of Tc1/mariner DNA transposons in the genomic assemblies of the Paracoccidioides
species complex are described. Families were distinguished based on significant BLAST identities between
transposases and/or TIRs. The expansion of Trem in a putative ancestor common to the species P. brasiliensis and P.
lutzii would have given origin to TremC and TremH, while other elements could have been acquired or lost after
speciation had occurred. The results may contribute to our understanding of the organization and architecture of
genomes in the genus Paracoccidioides.

Background
The thermodimorphic fungus Paracoccidioides brasiliensis is the etiological agent of paracoccidioidomycosis, a
systemic endemic disease that affects at least 10 million
people in Latin America [1]. Infection probably occurs
as a result of inhalation of conidia that subsequently
transform into yeast forms within the lung, resulting in
asymptomatic infection or infection that can progress to
acute (sub-acute) and chronic clinical forms of the disease [2]. Paracoccidioidomycosis is the 8th most common cause of death due to chronic/recurrent infections
and parasitic diseases in Brazil [3].
The teleomorph (sexual) stage of this fungus is
unknown, but analysis of the large rDNA subunit classified it as an Ascomycete, order Onygenales, family Onygenaceae, phylogenetically close to Ajellomyces, a genus
that harbors 2 other human dimorphic fungal pathogens, specifically Histoplasma capsulatum and Blastomyces dermatitidis [4]. Molecular analysis by random
amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) [5], restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) [6] and electrophoretic karyotyping showed extensive genetic
variability among distinct isolates [7,8].
RAPD, a technique popular for its simplicity, has been
useful in determining the existence of genetically distinct P. brasiliensis groups, their relationship with geographic distribution, and the similarity among clinical,
animal and environmental samples. However, the information has been difficult to compare. Gene polymorphism studies were pioneered by characterization of
PbGP43 polymorphism, a gene encoding the fungus
immunodominant antigen, in a sample of 17 isolates [9].
By comparing 2 sequenced PCR fragments from the
whole gene (exon 1, intron and exon 2) these authors
found 21 informative substitution sites, mostly in exon
2, which defined 5-6 genotypes. The maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree generated with these sequences
clearly reflected the presence of specific genetic groups
in the species. Subsequently, multilocus genealogy studies demonstrated evolutionary lineages identifying the
occurrence of cryptic phylogenetic species that were
morphologically indistinguishable by following the criteria of genealogical concordance and non-discordance
[10-12] which is used to identify the reduction of gene
flow between groups of individuals due to geographic or
reproductive isolation barriers. The PbGP43 locus,
whose characteristic genotypes have recently been
reviewed [13], was the most polymorphic and informative in these studies. Matute et al. [10] analyzed the
genetic structure of 65 P. brasiliensis isolates and concluded that they could be grouped into 3 distinct phylogenetic species: S1 (including isolate Pb18), PS2
(including isolate Pb03) and PS3 (composed exclusively

Page 2 of 20

of Colombian isolates). In a study of 21 P. brasiliensis
isolates, 14 of which had been included in the above
study, Carrero et al. [11] came to a similar conclusion
for all the isolates, with the exception of isolate Pb01,
which they suggested was a new phylogenetic species in
the genus Paracoccidioides. Recently, Teixeira et al. [12],
analyzing 88 isolates of the fungus, found that 17 of
them were genotypically similar, belonging to the Pb01like group. They estimated that the S1/PS2/PS3 species
clade and the Pb01-like new species, for which the name
Paracoccidioides lutzii was proposed, shared a common
ancestor approximately 32 million years ago. These studies suggested that the genus Paracoccidioides consists
of at least 4 different, previously unrecognized phylogenetic species: P. brasiliensis S1 (species), PS2 (phylogenetic species 2) and PS3 (phylogenetic species 3), and a
4th quite distinct lineage comprising fungal isolates formerly referred to as Pb01-like [11], now proposed to be
a new species, P. lutzii [12]. The multilocus sequence
analysis also supported recombination in nature in P.
brasiliensis (S1) [10] and P. lutzii [11,12], indicating the
presence of sexual reproduction. Thanks to The Broad
Institute Fungal Genome Initiative (FGI) Project, the
complete genome of representative isolates from P. brasiliensis S1 (Pb18), PS2 (Pb03) and Pb01 like (Pb01)
have recently been made available at the site: http://
www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/paracoccidioides_brasiliensis thus allowing further and specific comparisons among isolates. Previous local projects,
however, contributed to the construction of large
expressed sequence tag databases of Pb18 [14] and Pb01
[15,16].
Transposable elements (TEs) represent a substantial
fraction of eukaryotic genomes that have been found in
virtually all species investigated to date. They are abundant in fungi and represent 3-20% of the genomes of
many filamentous fungi [17,18]. TEs can produce a variety of effects in genomes, such as gene inactivation or
modification, chromosome breakage, and genome
recombination or rearrangement, thereby generating
plasticity [19]. Karyotyping and gene mapping indicated
the occurrence of chromosomal rearrangements [8],
which are associated with the presence of repetition and
TE in fungal genomes [17].
TEs can be grouped into 2 classes according to their
transposition mechanism. Class I consists of retrotransposons that transpose via an RNA intermediate that is
reverse-transcribed into DNA by a TE-encoded reverse
transcriptase. Class II elements, also called DNA transposons, move via a DNA intermediate. Because of the
abundance and diversity of TEs described in the eukaryotic genomes, a unified classification system for eukaryotic TEs has been proposed by different groups [20,21].

Marini et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:130

DNA transposons can be divided into 3 subclasses: the
first comprises the elements that transpose via the classical “cut-and-paste” mechanism; the second comprises
elements that transpose by replication involving the displacement of only one strand; and in the third, transposons move by a mechanism called “rolling-circle”
[20,21].
Subclass 1 DNA transposons require the cleavage of
both DNA strands for the transposition and have 2
orders - TIR and Crypton. Six superfamilies of the order
TIR from subclass 1 have been identified in fungi: Tc1/
mariner, hAT, Mutator, Transib, PIF-Harbinger and
CACTA. TIR transposases contain a signature active site
motif that consists of 3 acidic amino-acids (DDE or
DDD) and forms the catalytic pocket of the enzyme
responsible for cleaving DNA strands. Crypton, the only
superfamily representative of the second order, has only
been found to date in fungi and, unlike any previously
described transposons, encodes a putative tyrosine
recombinase instead of a classical transposase. This
recombinase lacks an RT domain, which suggests that
transposition occurs via a DNA intermediate. It does
not contain long repeat sequences, but is bordered by
short direct repeats that may have been generated by its
insertion into the host genome by recombination. Cryptons may be excised from the host genome by tyrosine
recombinase, generating a circular, extrachromosomal,
double-stranded DNA molecule, for which cleavage of
both DNA strands is required. Elements from subclasses
2 (Helitrons) and 3 (Maverick) have only one strand
cleaved during transposition and have also been identified in fungi, but the Tc1/mariner superfamily is probably the most prevalent in these organisms [20-22].
Transposons contain terminal inverted repeats (TIRs),
which are recognized by the pipsqueak helix-turn-helix
(HTH) motif in the transposase domain. Each subclass 1
DNA transposon superfamily is characterized by a specific transposase core that is different from those of other
superfamilies. Upon insertion, DNA transposons generate target site duplications (TSD) with lengths that are
relatively well conserved among superfamily members
[20,21].
TEs have been poorly characterized in P. brasiliensis.
Transcriptome analysis indicated that Ty-like retroelements were among the most abundant ESTs in P. brasiliensis [15]. Nascimento et al. [23], searching for
microsatellites that could be potentially useful as molecular markers, reported that a small number of them
were located in transposons. The focus of our work has
been the characterization of DNA transposons and their
derivatives in the genus Paracoccidioides. To this end
we searched for DNA transposons in the Paracoccidioides genomic sequence database http://www.broad.
mit.edu/annotation/genome/

paracoccidioides_brasiliensis. We have discovered 7 new
families of DNA transposons and one new subfamily of
Mariner-1_AF belonging to the Tc1/mariner superfamily. Remarkably, some Trem (Transposable element mariner) elements appear that may be active in the genomes
of representative isolates of 2 different Paracoccidioides
phylogenetic lineages. The finding of active autonomous
DNA transposons in P. brasiliensis may have implications for an understanding of the evolutionary processes
underlying the diversification of this group. Furthermore, transposons are efficient vectors for introducing
foreign DNA into cells.

Results
Occurrence of DNA transposons in the genus
Paracoccidioides

A survey of the P. brasiliensis Pb01 Functional and Differential Genome Project annotated EST database
(PbDBEST) [24] for sequences similar to transposase
sequences found 2 contigs (530 and 1938, with 673 and
637 bp respectively) that contain open reading frames
(ORF) encoding proteins of 155 and 71 amino acids,
respectively, with similarity to the conserved HTH DNA
binding domain of the transposase of the Aft1 DNA transposon in Aspergillus fumigatus. These sequences were
amplified from P. brasiliensis genomic DNA, their identities confirmed by sequence analysis, and then used as
probes in Southern blot hybridization with genomic DNA
of different P. brasiliensis isolates. This revealed the presence of multiple copies of DNA transposons dispersed
throughout the genome of different isolates. RT-PCR analysis of total RNA of the isolates Pb01 (recently proposed
to be a new species, P. lutzii) [12], Pb03 and Pb18 (P. brasiliensis, corresponding to distinct phylogenetic lineages
known, respectively, as S1 and PS2) [10] confirmed transcription of the putative elements (data not shown).
The transposon sequence from each EST contig was
used as a query in a modified BLASTN search (see
Methods section for details) against the whole genome
sequence assemblies of all 3 Paracoccidioides genomes
(Pb01, Pb03 and Pb18) and combined with the strategy
for identification of TIRs, what allowed the Artemis
annotation tool to be used to identify transposons.
Table 1 shows the number of sequence copies with
similarity to transposases identified in the genome of
each isolate sequenced. In total, 1332 hits were unambiguously identified in the genomes of Pb01 (n = 384),
Pb03 (n = 475) and Pb18 (n = 473). They were predicted
to have features that allowed them to be classified in the
Tc1/mariner superfamily. A significant number of the
hits found (n = 868; 65.2%) corresponded to highly defective elements, with lower conservation of the typical
transposase domains (HTH, CENPB and/or DDE), which
have still to be analyzed for classification (Table 1).

We also searched the Paracoccidioides genomes for
Cryptons, rolling-circle DNA transposons (Helitrons)
and self-synthesizing DNA transposons (Polintons)
[20,21], using consensus sequences for these elements
(tyrosine recombinase, helicase, replication protein A
and DNA polymerase B), no significant matches were
found.
In the genomic sequence of Pb01 (P. lutzii), only 3
DNA transposon families have been classified, corresponding to 102 (26.6%) of the 384 hits found in this
isolate (Table 1). In the set of elements for Pb03, 6 fulllength potentially functional autonomous elements coding for putative transposases with well-defined TIRs
were classified. The copies of the 6 elements found in
Pb03 totaled 177 hits, or 37.3% of the 475 hits, similar
to DNA transposons in this isolate (Table 1). Of the 473
hits registered in Pb18, 185 (39.1%) were identified and
correlated with Tc1/mariner elements.
Tc1/mariner superfamily in the genus Paracoccidioides

We identified 8 DNA transposon elements in Paracoccidioides that share 65-80% identity at the nucleotide level
with Tc1/mariner transposons deposited in Repbase [25]
(details in Additional file 1) at the Genetic Information
Research Institute (GIRI). Like the Tc1/mariner transposons, 6 of these elements are flanked by TA dinucleotide
(Figure 1). Because of their similarity to the Tc1/mariner
superfamily and the fact that most of them (61.6%) insert
specifically in TA target sites, these elements were given
the name Trem (an abbreviation for Transposable element mariner). The completeness of transposons was
confirmed by the presence of TIRs at both ends, followed
by multiple sequence alignment to well-studied examples
(Table 2, Figure 2). Incomplete sequences were not
included in the comparative analyses shown in Figure 2.
We examined 464 insertion loci of Trem elements (Table
2), of which 321 (69.2%) are flanked by well-defined
TIRs, while the remaining sequences, including all 17
TremG elements, are not flanked by TIRs.

respectively. The red boxes represent the Helix-Turn-Helix_pipsqueak

yellow triangles the terminal inverted repeats (TIRs).

There are 7 copies of TremA in the Pb03 isolate, 5
which contain a full-length ORF and 2 which are truncated, and 11 copies in the Pb18 isolate, 5 which have
an intact ORF (Figure 1, Table 2). TremA sequences
were aligned to build an 1850 bp consensus containing
a single ORF (nt 85-1728) that encodes a 547 amino
acid protein with 3 conserved domains characteristic of
transposases - HTH, CENPB and DDE (Figure 1). The
TremA TIRs are 49 bp long and have a 17 bp internal
direct repeat (Figure 2). Analysis of TremA with the
RepeatMasker script in the Girinst database http://www.
girinst.org/repbase revealed a similarity of only 66% with
the A. fumigatus Mariner-1_AF transposon, suggesting
that it may be a new DNA transposon family [20].

Tc1/mariner transposons (Aft1 from Aspergillus fumigatus, Tan1 from Aspergillus nidulans, Pot2 from Magnaporthe grisea and Fot1 from Fusarium
oxysporum). The boxes are the internal direct repeats, and the asterisks indicate the mismatches.

We found 36 copies of TremB, 15 in the genome of the
Pb03 isolate and 21 in Pb18 (Table 2). However, only 2
copies showed intact ORFs, which were used to generate
a 1857 bp consensus sequence flanked by 45 bp TIRs
(Table 2, Figures 1 and 2). This ORF (nt 130-1764)
encodes a 544 aa transposase with 3 conserved domains
(HTH, CENPB and DDE; Figure 1). Analysis using
RepeatMasker gave an index of 65% similarity with the
Mariner-1_AF. It is interesting that 25 TremB sequences
carrying truncated ORFs are flanked by intact TIRs.
TremC is the most abundant DNA transposon, having
165 truncated copies dispersed throughout the genomes.

The 32 longest sequences were aligned to generate a
1869 bp consensus flanked by 49 bp TIRs (Table 2, Figures 1 and 2). It contains 3 short ORFs, 2 which encode
the HTH and DDE domains (Figure 1). The central
region of the element shows similarity with A. fumigatus
transposases, and analysis by RepeatMasker revealed
66% similarity with Mariner-2_AO in Aspergillus oryzae.
The TremC shown in Figure 1 is based on the element’s
most conserved sequences.
TremD is present in a small number of copies (n = 5),
exclusively in the Pb18 isolate (Table 2). The consensus
sequence has 1891 bp and harbors a 1680 bp ORF

Marini et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:130

(nt 95-1774) flanked by 45 bp TIRs (Figures 1 and 2).
The ORF codes for a 559 aa transposase carrying the
HTH and DDE domains (Figure 1). RepeatMasker analysis showed 68% similarity with Mariner-1_AF in the
central region, and 80% similarity with the TIRs, suggesting that TremD is related to or belongs to this
family [20].
The consensus sequence for the TremE transposon,
found exclusively in the Pb01 isolate, is 1883 bp long,
flanked by 42 bp TIRs (Table 2, Figures 1 and 2). It
includes 2 ORFs: one has 1008 bp (nt 78-1085) and codes
for a 335 aa transposase with the HTH and DDE domains;
and the second (654 bp long, nt 1113-1766) encodes a 217
aa protein similar to a hypothetical protein (1e-47) from
Ajellomyces capsulatum (Figure 1). TremE showed a 65%
similarity with the Mariner-1_AF transposon.
With its 2329 bp consensus sequence, TremF is the
longest of the elements described in this study and the
third most abundant (n = 37) (Table 2, Figure 1). The consensus sequence is flanked by 43 bp TIRs and contains 2
ORFs: the first is 432 bp long (nt 89-520) and codes for a
143 aa protein harboring the conserved domain CENPB;
the second extends from position nt 650 to 2167
(1518 bp) and codes for a 505 aa DDE-domain-harboring
protein (Figures 1 and 2). The results of RepeatMasker
analysis revealed a 67% similarity with Mariner-9_AN in
Emericella nidulans, which is a non-autonomous DNA
transposon belonging to the pogo clade. Thus, TremF
could represent a new transposon family [20].
TremG, the 7th Tc1/mariner element we identified,
has 6 copies in Pb03 and 11 in Pb18 (Figure 1, Table 2).
All copies are truncated, flanked by highly divergent and
irregular sequences (35-124 bp). The central core of
some elements has an ORF coding for a 460 aa protein
carrying the DDE domain. Unfortunately, it was not
possible to determine the precise boundary of this element because of the divergence among the flanking
sequences. RepeatMasker analysis showed a 66% similarity with the Mariner-5_AF in A .fumigatus, a DNA
transposon of the Tc1 clade. For this reason, this element was classified as a Tc1/mariner transposon.
TremH is present in the 3 isolates, with 29 copies in
Pb01, 70 in Pb03 and 62 in Pb18 (Figure 1, Table 2). Of
the 161 copies of this element, 120 (74.5%) are flanked
by 42 bp TIRs; however, it was not possible to define its
target site. We used 6 copies that had the best sequence
conservation (94% identity among them) and encoded
the DDE motif to rebuild the 1882 bp consensus
sequence (including two 42 bp flanking TIRs). RepeatMasker analysis showed a 66% similarity with the Mariner3_AO in A .oryzae. The element copy contains an
ORF coding for a 525 aa protein carrying the DDE
motif (Figure 1), similar to that in the transposon in
Talaromyces stipitatus (2e-102) (Table 2). In this region,

Page 6 of 20

3 strictly conserved acidic amino acids - D(176), D(289)
and D(325) (positions relative to the transposase
sequence) - were found, and these probably constitute
the DDE catalytic motif in TremH. Since the transposase activity in many DNA transposons relies upon the
catalytic activity of the DDE domain, we suggest that
TremH is a Tc1/mariner-like transposon.
Phylogenetic analysis

The alignment of the predicted sequences corresponding
to each of the conserved transposase domains found in
8 DNA transposons in Paracoccidioides, with the
sequences of well-characterized DNA transposons of the
Tc1/mariner superfamily (Figure 3) from other species,
allows the identification of motifs considered essential
for active transposition (Figure 3). Some of the Paracoccidioides transposases are interrupted by stop codons,
minor indels or the absence of a translation initiation
codon (Table 2, Figure 1 and Additional file 2). The
complete catalytic triad DDE occurred in 6 of the elements (TremA, B, D, E, G and H) and was characterized
by the substitution of the glutamate residue by aspartate
to form a D, D(35 residues), D motif, as previously
observed in other fungal transposases. The triad signatures (the triad residues and the distances between
them) are very similar and can be represented by D10(111 residues)-D122-(35 residues)-D158 in the elements
TremA, B, D and E; D10-(109 residues)-D120-(35 residues)-D156 in the element TremG; and D7-(111 residues)-D119-(35 residues)-D155 in the element TremH.
In TremF, the first aspartic residue was deleted, but the
distance between the second and third aspartate residues was maintained (-D89-(35 residues)-D125). In
TremC, all 3 aspartic residues were absent.
In addition to the conserved catalytic triad DDD, transposases contain a number of other highly conserved,
group-specific amino acids, such as the HTH and
CENPB domains. The HTH domain was found in 5
Trem elements (TremA, B, C, D and E) with varying
degrees of conservation - 58% identity between the pairs
TremA/TremB, TremB/TremC and TremD/TremE, and
53% identity between TremA/TremC. The identities
between TremE/TremA and TremE/TremB were lower
than 40%. Alignment of the DNA-binding domains of
the transposases revealed a distinction between Trem
elements, which may be functionally connected to the
TIRs of these elements.
When the HTH domain was compared with that of
other fungal transposases, the highest identity index
(60%) was found between TremD and the Tan1 transposon of Aspergillus niger. The CENPB domain was present
in 3 of the Paracoccidioides transposons (TremA, B and
F). The identity between TremA and TremB was 65.6%,
and between these elements and Trem F less than 36%.

and Pot2 from Magnaporthe grisea. The Pogo element from Drosophila is also included to illustrate the conservation between kingdoms.
Sequences corresponding to the conserved residues are shaded in black (100% conservation), dark ash (80% conservation) and ash (60%
conservation). The DDD motif, characteristic of the catalytic domain of transposases, is highlighted in blue. Numbers indicate distance along
TremA.

It was also observed that 3 elements (TremA, TremB
and TremD) presented conserved Cx2Cx4Hx4C zinc
finger domains in the C-terminal ends of their transposases corresponding, respectively, to amino acid residues
531-544, 528-541 and 540-553. In TremC and TremE,
similar but non-canonical motifs were present at the Cterminal regions corresponding, respectively, to the residues 290-315 (CCx18Cx4H) and residues 404-419
(Cx2Cx2Hx8G).
Phylogenetic analysis using amino acid sequences clustered the transposases of Paracoccidioides into 2 major
groups, one carrying TremA, B, C, D, E and F elements,
and the other harboring TremH and G elements (Figure
4). This analysis confirms the proximity between TremA,
TremB and TremC elements (95% bootstrap) and
TremD and TremE elements (99% bootstrap). TremF elements, although clustered with the Trem elements above,
are divergent and located in a distinct branch. Based on
phylogenetic reconstructions (Figure 4), TremG and

TremH seem to form a cluster completely separated
from other Trem elements. Both groups contain Tc1/
mariner transposases that are also present in other fungi,
e.g. A. nidulans, A. fumigatus and A. oryzae.
Our analysis suggests that Trem elements of the different Paracoccidioides genomes were derived from a
single ancestral sequence present before they diverged
from one another. At a later point in the evolution of
this fungus, transposases split into 2 separate lineages,
giving rise to the family composed of TremA, B, C, D, E
and F and the other consisting of TremH and G.
Distribution and genomic environment of Trem elements

To characterize the insertion target sites and preferences
in Paracoccidioides genomes in more detail, junction
fragments between the transposon and the genome were
analyzed. Trem elements, like other Tc1/mariner transposons, integrate into a TA dinucleotide, causing targetsite duplication of the TA sequence at the TIR

boundary. Additional file 2 lists 321 independent insertion events identified in the 3 Paracoccidioides genomes,
demonstrating integration of the transposon into a TA
dinucleotide within the fungal genome and validating
genuine transposition.
Analysis of the genomic location of each Trem element insertion showed that they were dispersed across
the genomes. They did not, however, appear to be completely random (additional file 3). Genome sequences
from isolate Pb03 (29.05 Mb) were assembled in 65
supercontigs (scaffolds). The 475 hits similar to DNA

transposons (Table 1) were found along 53 of the 65
supercontigs of Pb03. Of these 53, 39 contain Trem elements (n = 177), which account for 1.14% of the genome of isolate Pb03 (additional file 4). In the genome of
Pb18 (29.95 Mb), there are 473 hits similar to DNA
transposons (Table 1) distributed in 44 of the 57 supercontigs, and Trem elements (n = 185) were found in 36
supercontigs of this isolate (additional file 5), covering
1.11% of the genome. In isolate Pb01 (genome size
32.94 Mb, 111 supercontigs), the 384 hits showing similarity to TEs (Table 1) were distributed along 87

Marini et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:130
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/130

supercontigs (approximately one element each 85 kb),
and Trem elements accounted for 0.58% of the genome
(additional file 6).
The above results suggest that Trem elements do not
integrate in a completely random fashion. In an
extended survey, the genomic context in which Trem
elements were inserted was examined in 100 kb region
of supercontigs 1 (length 3.65 Mb) and 18 (length 304
kb) of isolate Pb03 (Figure 5). In supercontig 1, this particular region has a high density of DNA transposons (7
hits), 6 of which belong to the Trem family (3 TremC, 2
TremH and 1 TremB) (Figure 5). In addition to the 6
Trem elements, 10 genes (including those coding for
thioesterase, lanthionine synthetase and hypothetical
proteins) and 12 pseudogenes are present. Among the
pseudogenes there is an unclassified pogo-like putative
DNA transposon. In supercontig 18, we found 5 Trem
elements (2 TremH, 1 TremA, 1 TremB and 1 TremC),
3 genes (cAMP kinase dependent protein, MSH2 and
hypothetical protein) and 17 pseudogenes. The analysis
showed that Trem elements target a wide variety of
chromosomal positions and some appearing to be clustered in several regions of the genome.
Southern blot and chromoblot hybridization analyses

Southern blot hybridization of Paracoccidioides genomic
DNA with TremA, TremB and TremE probes revealed
multiple bands, suggesting that multiple copies were
inserted with polymorphic distribution (Figure 6A). Differences between the hybridization profiles obtained
with the same Trem probe confirm the existence of different copy numbers and distribution of the element in
the isolates. No hybridization signal was observed in isolate Pb01 (P. lutzii) with probes TremA or TremB.
TremE probe hybridized with 10 well-defined bands in
Pb01 isolate, and weakly with a 1.0 kb band in Pb18 isolate (P. brasiliensis; Figure 6A). Probe TremA hybridized
with 3 of the 4 chromosomal bands observed in Pb03
and with 4 of the 5 in Pb18. Chromoblot hybridization
also confirmed the absence of TremA and TremB in
isolate Pb01 (Figure 6B). The P. brasiliensis synteny map
shows the location of 17 scaffolds in the 5 chromosomes
of isolate Pb18: http://www.broadinstitute.org/annotation/genome/paracoccidioides_brasiliensis/Chromomap.
html. TremA and TremB elements are present in 4
chromosomes, but are not found in chromosome 5, in
accordance with their karyotype profiles (Figure 6B).
PCR amplification of Trem elements in Paracoccidioides
isolates of distinct phylogenetic origin

TIRs of Trem elements consist of two 17 bp direct
repeats similar to those found in DNA transposons of
other fungi, namely Aft1 and Tan1 (Figure 2). The
repeats are completely conserved except for the TIRs of

Page 9 of 20

the elements TremB and TremH, in which one substitution was detected (Figure 2). PCR screening using primers derived from TIRs of each Trem element was
performed on genomic DNA from 17 clinical isolates,
including those from the FGI genome project, and one
environmental isolate (Table 3).
Of the 18 isolates, 15 had been previously genotyped
by sequencing and their phylogenetic relatedness was
known; the phylogenetic relatedness of the remaining 3
isolates - 2 Brazilian (Ed01, 1578) and one Argentinean
(utero) which had not been included in previous
sequencing and multi-locus studies - was unknown
(Table 3). Previous work using RAPD for typing P. brasiliensis indicated that the employment of certain primers and conditions allowed discrimination of isolates
with very low genetic similarity and clustering of the
most similar ones [5,6,26,27]. We considered that performing RAPD with these highly discriminatory primers
would allow us to build a dendrogram in which the
genetically most distant branches would correspond to
the species level, P. brasiliensis and P. lutzii (Pb01-like),
clustering isolates corresponding to the phylogenetic
species S1 and PS2, an assumption that would uncover
the phylogenetic relatedness of the 3 unknown isolates
(Ed01, 1578 and utero). The 18 isolates submitted to
RAPD analysis were classified as belonging to 3 of the 4
known phylogenetic lineages: S1 and PS2 (P. brasiliensis)
or Pb01-like (P.lutzii) [10-12] (Figure 7). Analysis of the
dendrogram showed 2 major clusters with a low coefficient of similarity (approximately 6%), the first corresponding to P. lutzii (Pb01, Ed01 and 1578). The second
branch comprised all 15 P. brasiliensis isolates showing
2 internal clusters (80% similarity), the first including 10
S1 and the second clustering 3 PS2 isolates (Pb2, Pb03
and Pb4; Table 3) [10-12]. The P. brasiliensis isolates
Penguin and Pb12, although previously defined as S1
(Table 3), did not group with the S1 isolates but appear
as 2 branches each with only one strain. It is interesting
that the isolates Penguin and Pb12 are from Uruguay
and Argentina, while the majority of the other isolates
are Brazilian (13, one Venezuelan - Pb2- and one Peruvian - Pb10). A fungal associated feature that has been
reported to correlate by RAPD branching or clustering
of Paracoccidioides isolates refers to the isolate’s geographic origin [6].
PCR analysis performed with primers corresponding
to the TIRs produced amplicons with sizes compatible
with the Trem elements described above, confirming the
results obtained in the genomic analysis (Figure 8). To
confirm the PCR specificity, the amplicons were hybridized with probes containing internal regions of each
Trem element (Figure 8). As expected, TremA was
amplified in Pb03 and Pb18 (P. brasiliensis, phylogenetic
species PS2 and S1, respectively) as well as in other

isolates phylogenetically related to them, except for Penguin and Pb06 isolates. A similar amplification pattern
was found for TremB in all PS2 and S1 isolates, except
for isolate Pb14. TremA and TremB were not found in
Pb01-like isolates. TremC was found in all isolates. A
strong hybridizing 1.9 kb band was detected in the
Pb01-like isolates. Two bands (1.9 and 1.8 kb) were
amplified in the PS2 and S1 isolates; however, only the
largest ones hybridized to the TremC probe. TremD

was detected in all S1 isolates but not in the Pb01-like
ones. TremE was amplified in Pb01-like isolates but not
in S1 or PS2 isolates. A 2.3 kb TremF amplicon was
detected in PS2 and S1 isolates. An additional hybridizing band of ~2.0 kb was detected in 7 S1 isolates, suggesting the presence of degenerate copies of TremF. In
the Pb01-like isolates, a smaller PCR product was
observed, but it did not hybridize with the TremF
probe. The element TremH was amplified in all isolates
we analyzed. Because of low copy-number of TremH in
Pb01-like isolates, a longer exposure of the autoradiogram was needed to visualize the hybridizing bands. A
strong hybridizing 2.0 kb band was seen in PS2 and S1
isolates. An additional hybridizing band of ~2.0 kb was
detected in 9 S1 isolates, suggesting the presence of
degenerate copies of TremH.
Transcription of TremA and B elements

were synthesized by RT-PCR using primers from
TremA and TremB shown in Additional file 7. The

Figure 7 Dendrogram of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis of 18 P. brasiliensis isolates. Dendrogram built from the
results of RAPD analysis of genomic DNA of 18 P. brasiliensis isolates using 6 random primers (see Methods). The RAPD analysis allowed clear
differentiation of the 18 isolates into 3 distinct groups Pb01-like, S1 and PS2. The Pb01-like isolates are highlighted in salmon, the S1 isolates in
lilac and the PS2 isolates in light blue

RT-PCR products were separated by electrophoresis
(Additional file 8), purified from the agarose gel and
cloned into TA-vectors for sequencing. Transcripts of
length corresponding to the unit size of the elements
were amplified for Pb03 and Pb18 (P. brasiliensis, phylogenetic species PS2 and S1, respectively), but not for
Pb01 (P. lutzii). Recombinant cDNA clones from isolate
Pb03 were sequenced and found to be homologous to
TremA (99.6% identity, NCBI accession number FJ886812) and TremB (99.3% identity, NCBI accession
number - FJ886813), confirming that these elements are
transcribed. In conclusion, Trem elements are not silent
in the genome.

Discussion
We have carried out the first systematic search for DNA
transposons in the genomic sequence of the dimorphic
pathogenic fungus Paracoccidioides, isolates Pb01 (P.
lutzii), Pb03 and Pb18 (P. brasiliensis, phylogenetic
lineages PS2 and S1, respectively) (Assembly 1). The
computational search strategy identified approximately
1300 putative transposon sequences (Table 1) in the
genome of the 3 isolates, signaling the occurrence of
class II TEs in the genus Paracoccidioides. We identified
8 families of transposons of the Tc1/mariner superfamily, based on the analysis of transposases and their associated TIRs and TSDs [20]. With the exception of
TremG, in which the TIRs could not be defined, Trem
elements are typical Tc1/mariner transposons exhibiting
the TIR-transposase-TIR structure. Tc1/mariner

superfamily is probably the most widely distributed
transposon family in nature, being frequently found in
the genomes of filamentous fungi [17,28]. However,
there have to date been no descriptions of DNA transposons in dimorphic fungi. However, DNA transposons
in the genus Aspergillus (subclass Eurotiomycetidae NCBI, “taxonomy browser”), phylogenetically related to
the dimorphic fungi, have already been identified
[29,30].
Trem elements represent a significant proportion of
the genome - around 1% of the genome of P. brasiliensis
(isolates Pb03 and Pb18) and 0.6% of P. lutzii (Pb01) indicating their successful proliferation in the genome.
It is noteworthy that the majority (60-70%) of putative
Paracoccidioides DNA transposons correspond to
degenerated sequences (probably older insertions) that
are difficult to classify; and were not included in this
description. Among the remaining sequences, it may be
possible to find elements belonging to the MITEs ("Miniature Inverted-repeat Transposable Elements”), a category of small, nonautonomous DNA transposons (100500 bp) carrying preserved TIRs found in various organisms, including fungi [31].
Of the 464 Trem copies, 16 (3.5%) may be potentially
autonomous active elements, as judged by the presence
of intact TIRs and ORFs coding for transposases. Copies
with truncated ORFs but preserved TIRs may be mobilized in trans by the enzyme coded by an intact copy
[20]. HTH and DDE domains were preserved in the
potentially active Trem elements. As previously observed

analysis of a phylogenetically diverse panel of P. brasiliensis isolates. Oligonucleotide primer pairs are given in Additional File 7. PCR amplification

indicated. Asterisks (*) indicate the P. brasiliensis isolates sequenced in the FGI of Broad Institute. Right: PCR amplicons were blotted onto nylon
membranes and hybridized with Trem probes. Because the copy-number of each element differs among the P. brasiliensis isolates, exposure
times for autoradiograms were not equivalent. They were: 20 h for TremD; 1 h for TremC and TremF; 10 min for TremA, TremB and TremE. Two
different exposition times were used for TremH: 20 h (boxed area) and 10 min.

in fungi, the glutamyl residue of the DDE domain was
substituted by an aspartyl residue (DDD) [29,30]. The
currently most known eukaryotic cut-and-paste transposons are DDE-superfamilies, PiggyBac and Tc1/Mariner
being the only 2 superfamilies encoding DDD-transposases. Conservation of the triad signature (DDD) in Tc1/
mariner transposons may reflect a catalytic mechanism
similar to that described for the DDE motif, which probably coordinate divalent metal ions to promote catalysis
of DNA cleavage and ligation.

The CENPB domain was found in TremA, TremB and
TremF elements. This domain has been identified in
mammalian centromeric proteins and eukaryotic transposases, but not in any archaeal, bacterial or plant proteins. It may be implicated in the recognition of the
terminal inverted repeats of transposons. The functional
similarity between CENPB domains could be the result
of domestication of transposons by the host genome to
act as its own genes or regulatory elements [29,32-34].
The N-terminal HTH domain, also found in the

Marini et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:130
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/130

truncated elements TremC and TremE, has similarity
with the “pipsqueak” DNA-binding domain of Drosophila, a family of eukaryotic proteins that recognize and
bind to DNA sequences [35]. The terminal inverted
repeats were identified in 7 of the 8 Trem elements.
The inverted regions had sizes compatible with those of
other elements belonging to the Tc1/mariner superfamily described in fungi, and also had a 17 bp internal
direct repeat, as previously reported [17,29,36]. It was
suggested that this direct repetition could be the recognition and binding of the HTH and CENPB transposase
domains [37].
An interesting finding was the presence of conserved
Cx2Cx4Hx4C (CCHC) motifs indicating zinc finger (ZF)
domains in the C-terminal ends of transposases of at
least 3 Trem elements (TremA, TremB and TremD).
The ZF, which is present in a wide range of proteins,
forms a structure stabilized by co-ordination of a divalent zinc cation [Zn (II)], with cysteine or histidine residues as ligands. ZF are structurally diverse and present
among proteins with a broad range of cellular functions,
such as replication and repair, transcription and translation, metabolism and signaling, cell proliferation and
apoptosis. Krishna et al. [38], who described 8 fold
groups of ZF, discussed their similarities and differences
with functional implications. The fold group 1 consists
of 2 families: C2H2 fingers and IAP (inhibitor of apoptosis) domains. IAP contains a CCHC pattern that coordinates a zinc ion, a pattern similar to that found at the
C-terminal region of Trem elements transposases. The
ZF is responsible for binding to DNA or RNA in some
proteins, or for the protein-protein interaction in others.
Ohta et al. [39] described transposases encoded by
transposable elements of the Insertion Sequences 1 (IS1
family) of Escherichia coli as having N-terminal regions
containing a C2C2 ZF motif. They showed that the ZF
motif, as well as the HTH motif, is essential for transposition promoted by IS1transposase because of their
involvement in binding specifically to TIRs. IS1 transposases with an amino acid substitution in the HTH or ZF
motif lose the ability to promote transposition, indicating that 2 domains are responsible for TIR-specific
DNA binding in promoting transposition. It is likely
that the 2-domain structure is required for binding to
TIRs, not only in IS1transposase, but also in transposases encoded by some other transposable elements, in
order to place a catalytic domain of transposases in a
region near the TIR end, where strand transfer reactions
occur in transpososomes. These observations suggest
the possibility that transposases encoded by some elements have 2 domains involved in the TIR-specific
DNA-binding. In eukaryotes, a Drosophila transposable
element P encodes a transposition inhibitor that has a
CCHC region forming a ZF that plays an important role

Page 14 of 20

in the binding to the TIR sequences at the termini of
the P element [38,39].
When transposons move along the genome, footprints
known as TSDs ("Target Site Duplications”) can be
formed that flank the element. Most transposon superfamilies may have a characteristic TSD with a specific size
and sequence [20]. TSDs were found in 6 out of the 8
Trem elements. It was not possible to determine the
TIRs in TremG and consequently find the flanking TSD.
The copies of TremH are truncated and probably inactivated, resulting in loss or alteration of the TSD, consequently preventing its identification.
As the DNA transposons of the Tc1/mariner superfamily have the dinucleotide TA as their insertion site,
they can be inserted within virtually any genomic region.
However, regional preferences have been observed for
many elements which are inserted in specific regions of
the genome [40]. The comparison of the number and
identity of nested insertions within individual transposons has been used to estimate the relative ages of
transposons. It is reasonable to assume that the older
elements are subjected to interruptions by more recently
active elements. Older elements should therefore have
higher proportions of nested insertions than younger
elements. Assuming that DNA transposon insertions
occur randomly throughout the genome, there should
be a higher proportion of nested insertions for older
Trem elements than for younger ones. The following
evidence could support the hypothesis of recent transposition and expansion of Trem elements in the genome: (a) the absence of nested Trem copies inside other
transposons; (b) the presence of intact open reading
frames; and (c) the presence of highly similar copies in
some Trem elements. Analysis of Southern blots and
chromoblots of genomic DNA from isolates from 2 different species, P. lutzii (Pb01) and P. brasiliensis (Pb03
and Pb18), corroborates the in silico data in relation to
the presence and distribution of Trem elements in these
genomes.
Trem elements do not appear to have been acquired
simultaneously by the Paracoccidioides sequenced genomes, as indicated by finding of different copy-numbers
among Trem families. The elements TremC and TremH
are present in a large number of copies, most of which
are truncated elements with stop codons. Unlike TremC
and TremH, TremD is only present in 5 copies, 4 of
which have integral ORFs, just in isolate Pb18 (P. brasiliensis, phylogenetic species S1). This pattern is compatible with a recent insertion in the genome, as TremD
would not yet have been inactivated by the genome
defense system.
Several recent studies have proposed the existence of
different phylogenetic species in the taxon P. brasiliensis. Matute et al. [10] analyzed the genetic structure of

Marini et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:130
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/130

65 P. brasiliensis isolates, concluding that they can be
grouped into 3 distinct phylogenetic species: S1 (including isolate Pb18), PS2 (including isolate Pb03) and PS3
(composed exclusively of Colombian isolates). In a study
of 21 P. brasiliensis isolates, 14 of which had been
included in the above study, Carrero et al. [11] reached
a similar conclusion for all the isolates except isolate
Pb01, which they suggested was a new phylogenetic species in the genus Paracoccidioides. Recently, Teixeira et
al. [12], analyzing 88 isolates of the fungus, found that
17 were genotypically similar, belonging to the Pb01-like
group. They estimated that the S1/PS2/PS3 species
clade and the Pb01-like new species, for which the name
P. lutzii was proposed, shared a common ancestor
approximately 32 million years ago.
We used PCR to analyze the distribution of Trem elements in 17 clinical isolates and one environmental isolate formerly known as P. brasiliensis. Previous reports
using RAPD for typing P. brasiliensis indicated that the
use of certain primers and conditions allowed the discrimination of isolates with very low genetic similarity
clustering the most similar ones. The primers chosen
discriminated of P. brasiliensis isolates into groups with
very low genetic similarity indexes (17-35% when the
Pb01 isolate was included or at least 50-60% when it
was not) [5,26,41]. Probably for this reason our RAPD
analysis resulted in the clustering of isolates previously
known to belong to a certain phylogenetic species
(Pb01-like, S1 and/or PS2), which could be a reference
for the characterization of those of unknown genetic
relatedness (Table 3, see isolates Ed01, 1578 and utero).
The 18 isolates consisted of the sequenced Pb01 and 2
Pb01-like isolates (P. lutzii) [12]; 3 isolates previously
classified as PS2 (including isolate Pb03); and 12 isolates
identified as S1 (including Pb18). PS3, the fourth known
phylogenetic species reported to be exclusively in
Colombia was not represented [10]. The isolates were
grouped in accordance with Matute et al.[10], Carrero
et al. [11], Teixeira et al. [12] and the results of RAPD
analysis (Figure 7) [27]. Isolates Penguin and Pb12 are
known to be P. brasiliensis (S1) but do not cluster with
the other S1 isolates (Figure 7). These isolates come
from different geographic regions, Uruguay and Argentina, while the majority is Brazilian (13 isolates, Table
3). It is interesting that a fungal associated feature that
has been reported to correlate by RAPD branching or
clustering of Paracoccidioides refers to the isolate’s geographic origin [13]. The non-grouping of all S1 isolates
would be explained by the fact that multilocus sequencing studies employ nuclear genes while RAPD would
arbitrarily reveal polymorphic regions along the genomes, including intergenic and/or repetitive sequence.
The DNA transposons TremC and TremH were identified in all the isolates tested, indicating that these

Page 15 of 20

elements would have already been present in a hypothetical common ancestor rather than have been acquired
horizontally after the 3 phylogenetic species diverged
from one another. In contrast, TremE was only found in
Pb01 and Pb01-like isolates, and TremA, TremB, and
TremF were found in the S1 and PS2 isolates, while the
element TremD was almost exclusively found in S1 isolates, suggesting that these DNA transposons could have
been acquired horizontally after separation of the 3 phylogenetic species. Although TremD and TremE share
approx 70% similarity at the amino acid level, they were
found exclusively in the S1 and Pb01-like isolates,
respectively, which are phylogenetically distant. This
suggests that these elements would have been acquired
by horizontal transfer after the split between S1/PS2 (P.
brasiliensis) and Pb01-like species (P. lutzii). This
hypothesis is supported by the finding of hypothetical
protein sequences of A. capsulatum in GenBank (accession numbers XM 001537507 and XM 001543155) that
yielded an e-value of 0.0 for the elements TremD and
TremE, respectively (i.e. their sequences are identical or
have at least 80% identity). However, the absence of
TremD and TremE could also be explained by the loss
of these elements in some strains.
Transcription of TremA and TremB suggests that they
could be active elements. When transposing, the elements generate double-strand DNA breaks, which are
repaired by the cellular machinery [42]. Hence, in addition to the direct effects of transposition, such as gene
inactivation, recombination events promoted by repair
of the double strand would also take place. Transposition of these elements could be a factor involved in the
genetic variability observed in the P. brasiliensis species
complex. The identification of active elements would
serve as a basis for the development of mutational tools,
as transposons could be efficient vectors for
modifications.

Conclusions
The strategy developed in the present work proved
effective in identifying and characterizing DNA transposons in the newly generated sequence assemblies of isolates of 3 phylogenetic species of the P. brasiliensis
complex. The most intact insertions allowed the classification of 7 new families and a new subfamily of elements (TremA - H) that share identity with the Tc1/
mariner superfamily, distinct lineages not yet identified
in dimorphic fungi. Three full-length, potentially functional autonomous elements were characterized (Trem
A, B and D). Further studies to show their active transposition would be interesting. The phylogenetic analysis
supports the hypothesis that Trem families derived from
a single ancestral sequence and split into 2 lineages
(TremA - F; TremG - H). The occurrence of Trem

Marini et al. BMC Genomics 2010, 11:130
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/11/130

families is unequal in the genomic sequence of the isolates Pb01, Pb03 and Pb18 and experimental evidence
from the other 15 typed isolates indicated that some
Trem families (TremC and H) were shared while other
Trem families were harbored exclusively by Pb01-like
species (P. lutzii) (TremE) or S1/PS2 species (P. brasiliensis) (TremA, B, D, and F). It would be interesting to
verify the occurrence of distinct Trem families in a larger number of P. lutzii and P. brasiliensis isolates from
different origins (either clinical or environmental), and
from different geographic regions, also including the
phylogenetic species PS3, not represented here, in such
a way as to expand and explore the potential of these
newly presented genetic agents as sources of phylogenetic and epidemiological knowledge.

Methods
Bioinformatic analysis

A retrieval based on specific keywords (transposase,
transposons, transposable) was performed against the P.
brasiliensis Functional and Differential Genome Project
EST annotated database (PbDBEST) http://www.biomol.
unb.br/[15,24] to identify sequences containing particular annotation terms related to transposable elements.
At the time of writing, 2 contigs have been identified:
Contigs 530 (673 bp) and 1938 (637 bp), GenBank
accession numbers CN240498 and CN247880,
respectively.
These contigs were further used in similarity searches
using BLAST algorithm [38] (specifically blastn and
tblastx with default parameters) against the first draft of
the genomic sequence of P. brasiliensis isolates Pb03,
Pb01 and Pb18 released by the Fungal Genome Initiative
Project (FGI) of The Broad Institute http://www.broad.
mit.edu.

Page 16 of 20

This method takes into account the advantage of the
knowledge of particular genomic features characteristic
of specific classes of the elements to aid their
identification.
The homology-based method we developed identifies
transposable elements by comparing genomic query
sequences (Pb01, Pb03 and Pb18) against themselves.
Sequence comparison by BLAST algorithm took into
account query hits identified in a search using only the
top strand (-S 1 parameter) to search against database, a
word size of 7. To prevent long high-scoring segment
pairs (HSPs) being broken up into smaller ones because
of low-complexity segments and repeats, the default filter (DUST) was turned off. Specific databases containing
each genomic sequence of P. brasiliensis isolates were
built converting the DNA sequence into its reversecomplement counterpart. Similarity results that emerge
from this self comparison were parsed by 2 in-house
developed PERL (Practical Extraction and Report Language) scripts. These scripts specifically convert the
standard BLAST output into a tabular format and allow
the identification of pairs of inverted repeats at approximately 2.5 Kb from each other (i.e. the average distance
between TIRs of Tc1/mariner elements).
The sequence stretches containing flanking inverted
repeats identified using this initial criteria were finally
compared in terms of the putative gene products
encoded against NCBI nr protein database to identify
putative transposable elements.
Annotation

The P. brasiliensis genomic sequences of isolates Pb01,
Pb03 and Pb18 from the Fungal Genome Initiative Project (FGI) of The Broad Institute were downloaded
(Paracoccidioides brasiliensis Database) http://www.
broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/paracoccidioides_brasiliensis/Downloads.html and used in the in silico analysis described in this work. The locally compiled
database of P. brasiliensis sequences, built by parsing
sequences from the original database, was used for
sequence similarity searches, using the BLAST [43]
algorithm.

The annotation and graphical output of the supercontigs
were performed using ARTEMIS [44] software http://
www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Artemis/ and 4 in-house
developed PERL scripts to analyze and format the
results.
Classification of the DNA transposons follows the
nomenclature previously established, and families and subfamilies were disclosed according to the standard principles of TE classification [20,45-47]. In this report we
define the DNA transposon family by DNA sequence as
described by Wicker at al. [20]: 2 elements belong to the
same family if they share 80% (or more) sequence identity
in at least 80% of their coding region or internal domain
or within their terminal repeats (or both). All consensus
sequences (Additional file 9) were submitted to Repbase
using the Repeat Masking algorithm to identify related elements http://www.girinst.org/censor/index.php.

Transposon mapping and TIR identification

Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic inference

To identify and map transposable elements in the genomic sequences of P. brasiliensis isolates Pb03, Pb01 and
Pb18, an approach was developed that we called “ClassSpecific Method for transposable element identification”.

Global multiple sequence alignments using amino acid
sequences from identified transposases and nucleotide
sequences from identified transposons were performed
using the ClustalX algorithm [48], followed by visual

Databases

inspection and manual adjustment with SeaView [49]
http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/software/seaview.html and GeneDoc http://www.psc.edu/biomed/genedoc/.
Phylogenetic reconstruction of the sequences aligned by
ClustalW [48] were performed using Neighbor-joining
method implemented in MEGA 4 [50]. Trees were constructed using the equal-input model with 5000 bootstrap
replicates. Branch lengths reflect the sequence divergence
(see the scale bar). The amino acid sequences used in the
phylogenetic reconstruction are available at: http://www.
girinst.org/repbase/update/browse.php with the follow
locus names: Mariner-6_AN, Mariner-3_AF, Mariner7_AN, Mariner-1_AF, Mariner2_AO, Mariner3_AO, Mariner-5_AF, Mariner-7_AF, Mariner-3a_AN, Mariner3_AN, Mariner-1_AN, Mariner-4_AN, Mariner-5_AN,
Mariner5_AO. The amino acid sequences from pogo_
DM and Pot2_MG (NCBI accession number S20478 and
XP364943, respectively) were also used.
P. brasiliensis isolates and growth conditions

The characteristic P. brasiliensis isolates are listed in
Table 3. Fungal isolates were maintained by periodic
subculturing in PYG medium (yeast extract 5 g, bactopeptone 10 g, dextrose 15 g, and Agar 15 gl-1, pH 6.3)
at 35-37°C [8].
DNA and RNA extraction

Total DNA was extracted from the yeast culture following previously described protocols involving maceration
of frozen cells, with minor modifications [51]. Total
RNA was extracted from the yeast cultures as previously
reported [52].
PCR

PCR reactions were carried out on 10 ng of DNA in a
50 μL reaction mixture containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH
9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 100 mM of each dNTP,
100 pmol of each oligonucleotide and 1 unit of Taq
DNA Polymerase (Promega). Each PCR was carried out
in a programmable temperature controller (Eppendorf)
for 25 cycles. The cycling conditions were as follows:
denaturing at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at the Tm for
each primer for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 1 min.
At the end of the 25th cycle, the heat-denaturing step
was omitted and extension was allowed to proceed at
72°C for 5 min. The primers and respective Trem are
listed in Additional file 7.
RAPD analysis

RAPD analysis was performed as previously described
[5,26,41], using the primers OPG03 (GAGCCCTCCA),
OPG11 (TGCCCGTCGT), OPG15 (ACTGGGACTC),
OPG16 (AGCGTCCTCC), OPG18 (GGCTCATGTG)
and OPO06 (CCACGGGAAG).

Page 17 of 20

PCR reactions were carried out in 10 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 9, 2 mM MgCl 2 , 50 mM KCl, 200 mM of each
dNTP, and 0.25 mM of each oligonucleotide in a 20 μL
reaction mixture containing 1 unit of Taq DNA Polymerase (Phoneutria). The cycling conditions were as follows: denaturing at 94°C for 3 min followed by 40 cycles
of denaturing at 94°C for 45 s, annealing at 36°C for 45
s and extension at 72°C for 105 s. At the end of the 40th
cycle, the heat-denaturing step was omitted and extension was allowed to proceed at 72°C for 3 min. The products were separated by polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and silver stained (5% silver stain). Digitized gel images were analyzed by LabImage version
2.7.1, and dendrograms were generated by TFPGA software version 1.3.
Transcriptional analysis

First- and second-strand cDNAs were prepared using
SuperScript One-Step reverse transcriptase PCR (RTPCR) with Platinum Taq according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Life Technologies). Specific forward
or reverse primers based on the nucleotide sequences of
the elements TremA and TremB were used with oligo
(dT) to amplify sequences by PCR. Genomic DNA false
positive results were excluded by performing the reaction in the absence of reverse transcriptase, and with a
treatment of RNA samples, prior to the RT-PCR reaction, with DNase I, RNase free.
Cloning and sequencing

TremA and TremB genomic and cDNA amplicons were
then cloned into plasmid pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) and transformed into Escherichia coli DH5 a
competent cells. Nucleotide sequences of cDNA clones
were determined by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method, using BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing chemistry (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI PRISM
377 DNA sequencer.
Blotting analysis

For Southern blot analysis, PCR amplifications or DNA
samples digested with the restriction enzyme BglII,
were separated by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels
and stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 μg/mL). For
chromoblot analysis, the separation of chromosomesized P. brasiliensis DNA molecules by PFGE (pulsed
field gel electrophoresis) was performed as described
by Feitosa et al. [8]. The agarose gels were incubated
with 0.25 M HCl for 30 min, denatured with 0.5 M
NaOH/1 M NaCl for 30 min, neutralized with 1 M
Tris-base/0.5 M NaCl for 20 min and transferred onto
nylon membranes in 20 × SSC (0.15 M NaCl and
0.015 M sodium citrate). The membranes were prehybridized in a solution containing 50% formamide-5×, 5

× SSC, 0.5% Denhardt’s solution, 0.1 mg/mL salmon
sperm DNA and 0.1 mg/mL tRNA at 42°C for 1 h, and
then hybridized overnight at the same temperature
with a 32 P-labeled probe. The probes used in the
hybridization experiments were derived from the internal region of each element, including the ORF. Following hybridization, the membranes were washed 3 times
(30 min each) in 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS at
42°C, 1 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS and 0.1 × SSC
containing 0.1% SDS at 56°C, before being exposed to
X-ray film.
