Abstract
Background: The Dscam gene in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, contains twenty-four exons,
four of which are composed of tandem arrays that each undergo mutually exclusive alternative
splicing (4, 6, 9 and 17), potentially generating 38,016 protein isoforms. This degree of transcript
diversity has not been found in mammalian homologs of Dscam. We examined the molecular
evolution of exons within this gene family to locate the point of divergence for this alternative
splicing pattern.
Results: Using the fruit fly Dscam exons 4, 6, 9 and 17 as seed sequences, we iteratively searched
sixteen genomes for homologs, and then performed phylogenetic analyses of the resulting
sequences to examine their evolutionary history. We found homologs in the nematode, arthropod
and vertebrate genomes, including homologs in several vertebrates where Dscam had not been
previously annotated. Among these, only the arthropods contain homologs arranged in tandem
arrays indicative of mutually exclusive splicing. We found no homologs to these exons within the
Arabidopsis, yeast, tunicate or sea urchin genomes but homologs to several constitutive exons from
fly Dscam were present within tunicate and sea urchin. Comparing the rate of turnover within the
tandem arrays of the insect taxa (fruit fly, mosquito and honeybee), we found the variants within
exons 4 and 17 are well conserved in number and spatial arrangement despite 248–283 million
years of divergence. In contrast, the variants within exons 6 and 9 have undergone considerable
turnover since these taxa diverged, as indicated by deeply branching taxon-specific lineages.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that at least one Dscam exon array may be an ancient duplication
that predates the divergence of deuterostomes from protostomes but that there is no evidence
for the presence of arrays in the common ancestor of vertebrates. The different patterns of
conservation and turnover among the Dscam exon arrays provide a striking example of how a gene
can evolve in a modular fashion rather than as a single unit.

Background
Many genes containing tandem exon arrays undergo
mutually exclusive alternative splicing, in which only one
exon variant within a tandem array of related variants is
incorporated into the mature transcript [1,2]. In the fruit
fly, Drosophila melanogaster, this form of alternative splicing can potentially produce 38,016 distinct, mature RNAs
from a single gene, Down Syndrome Cell Adhesion Molecule (Dscam) [3-6]. Similar arrays of exon variants have
been reported in homologs of Dscam from other Diptera
(D. pseudoobscura and D. virilis and the mosquito Anopheles gambiae), the honeybee Apis mellifera (Hymenoptera)
[4,7,8], and most recently the flour beetle Tribolium castaneum (Coleoptera) and the silk moth Bombyx mori (Lepidoptera) [9].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/16

The fly Dscam gene encodes proteins that are members of
the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily of cell adhesion
molecules, and appears to be involved in neuronal axon
guidance and bifurcation [4,10-12]. It may also be
involved in adaptive immunity in insects [9]. The protein
is comprised of both an extracellular domain that is
highly conserved between insect and vertebrate species,
and an intracellular domain for which there is little
sequence similarity between the insects and vertebrates.
Nonetheless, it has been shown in both groups that the
intracellular domain activates Pak1 [13], though in the
insects this is an indirect interaction through the adaptor
protein Dock.

The name of the gene derives from the fact that one of the
designated human Dscam homologs maps to a Down syndrome-associated region on chromosome 21; Down syndrome is the most common inherited form of mental
retardation [14,15]. Another homolog, Dscam-like, maps
to a locus on chromosome 11 that is associated with the
neurological disorders Giles de la Tourette syndrome and
Jacobsen syndrome [16]. Though evidence indicates that
human Dscam may perform similar functions as its fly
homolog, the specific functional role(s) of the human
Dscam protein are still under investigation [13,14]. To
date, the human Dscam gene has been reported to produce
only three alternative transcripts [16], raising a question
about the extent to which transcriptional diversity is
found among members of the gene family as a whole.
To address this question, we first located then analyzed
the evolution of exons homologous to those within fly
Dscam that contain tandem arrays of alternative splice variants: exons 4 (12 variants), 6 (48 variants), 9 (33 variants), and 17 (2 variants) [4,5,17]. These exons code for
extracellular and transmembrane domains of the protein.
A tandem exon array consists of multiple variants, each of
which contains a unique alternative 5' (donor) and 3'
(acceptor) splice site. Only one variant from an array is
incorporated into each mature transcript, and different
transcripts may incorporate different variants. The variants in Dscam presumably arose through tandem exon
duplication, since they share similar sequences. Exon
arrays containing three or fewer variants have been
observed in humans [18,19], and few cases of large tandem arrays are known, such as Pcdh genes, some of which
have up to 22 variable exons in a tandem array [20]. Several other genes in vertebrates have also been found to
have variable first exons in tandem arrays which undergo
alternative splicing [21]. Notably, however, such exon
arrays appear to be absent from human Dscam and Dscamlike genes [16].
Because there is a striking difference in the levels of transcript diversity that can be generated among the homologs
of this gene [7,8,14], it is an intriguing system for studying
the evolution of mutually exclusive splicing. Here we
address a number of outstanding questions about this
gene family. Do tandem arrays of exons homologous to
those in fly Dscam exist elsewhere in non-insect genomes?
If not, were tandem arrays lost along the lineage leading
to mammals or gained along the lineage leading to
insects? Do the exon variants undergo turnover within the
array and, if so, how rapidly? Are the rate and mode of
evolution similar among the different exon arrays?
To answer these questions, we began with the Dscam exon
variants from each of the fly exon arrays 4, 6, 9 and 17,
performing searches for homologous exons amongst six-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/16

teen genomes (Figure 1) and filtering those matches by
criteria described in the methods. Once the sets of homologous exons were identified, we used Bayesian methods
to infer the phylogeny of each one.

Results
Homologous sequences are present only within the
Arthropoda, Nematoda, and Vertebrata
The phylogenetic relationships among the sixteen taxa
included in this study are shown in Figure 1. Collectively,
we identified a total of 13,107 exon sequences homologous to the fly exon arrays in the vertebrate, nematode and
insect genomes. Homologous sequences were not found
in the yeast, sea urchin, tunicate, or plant genomes.
Assuming that homologous sequences were most likely
present in the most recent common ancestor of vertebrates, nematodes, and insects rather than acquired via
horizontal transfer, the absence of homologous sequences
from sea urchins and tunicates suggests that they have
been lost from these genomes or have diverged beyond
recognition. We also searched for sequences homologous
to the constitutive exons that flank the tandem arrays
(exons 3, 5, 8 and 10) within the fly Dscam gene.
Homologs were not found in the yeast or plant genomes
but were found in the tunicate, sea urchin, nematode, vertebrate, and insect genomes. The fact that regions similar
to constitutive exons of Dscam were found within tunicate
and sea urchin but that the alternatively spliced exons
were not suggests unique selective pressures between the
two classes of exon.

The number and taxonomic distribution of homologs varies among the exons. Sets seeded with exons 4, 6, 9 and 17
of D. melanogaster contained 84, 130, 12,515 and 378
members, respectively. Each set contained all of the exons
in the corresponding D. melanogaster exon array. For exon
arrays 4, 9 and 17, each mammalian species possessed
only one homolog within an annotated Dscam gene
(human Dscam: [GenBank:NM_001389]; mouse Dscam:
and
rat
Dscam:
[Gen[GenBank:AF315558];
Bank:NM_133587]). Each also possesses a single
homolog to the Dscam-like gene (human DscamL: [GenBank:AF491813]; mouse DscamL: [GenBank:AF487345];
and rat DscamL: [GenBank:XM_236202]). Variants of the
fly exon 9 array are also homologous to over 100
sequences within the titin gene on human chromosome 2.
We have also found homologous sequences to exon arrays
4, 9 and 17 in zebrafish, tetraodon, fugu, frog, and dog
genomes where neither Dscam nor Dscam-like had been
annotated at the time of this study.
Each of the 130 sequences homologous to the exon 6
array were from the insect genomes studied (fly, mosquito
or honeybee). There do not appear to be any sequences
homologous to the exon 6 array within either of the mam-

respectively). Fly exon 9 variants are homologous to exon
10 variants in both mosquito and honeybee, where we
found the reported thirty-eight exon 10 splice variants in
mosquito and seventeen in honeybee. Fly exon 17 is
homologous to mosquito exon 14 and honeybee exon 22.
We found the two variants for each of these exons. Interestingly, we identified new homologs to fly exons 4 and 6
that were dispersed throughout the fly, mosquito and
honeybee genomes. These are shown as "homolog_ (suffix)" in figures 3 and 6, and their chromosomal locations
are listed in Additional file 5.
Tandem arrays are only present in the insect Dscam genes
None of the vertebrate exon homologs we found, including those in genomes where Dscam was unannotated,
were contained within tandem arrays, with the exception

of matches in the human titin gene. The new vertebrate
homologs appear to correspond to multiple genes in each
vertebrate genome examined, as evidenced by their physical locations [see Additional file 5]. Furthermore, the
newly identified homologs within fly, mosquito and honeybee were all found at unique positions, indicating that
none of these are situated in tandem arrays. We examined
the 183 homologs of fly exon 9 found within the human
titin gene, by searching these sequences against titin transcripts. The transcript CAD12456.1 had matches for 158
of the fly homologs with 100% identity, and
NP_596869.2 (titin variant N2A) had 156 perfect
matches. The simultaneous matching of a majority of
exons within individual transcripts strongly suggests that
these homologs do not undergo mutually exclusive splicing. Our result does not rule out other forms of splicing,

and in fact titin is known to undergo extensive splicing
that results in variable length transcripts due to exon-skipping (e.g. [22-25]).
Taken in sum, these results indicate that none of these
Dscam exon homologs undergo mutually exclusive splicing outside of the arthropods.
Vertebrate Dscam homologs can be distinguished by core
residues
We generated protein multiple sequence alignments
(MSAs) for the four sets of homologous sequences. There
are 47 residues in the edited alignment for exon 4, 27 for
exon 6, 53 for exon 9, and 41 for exon 17. The alignments
consist of homologs from the annotated Dscam genes and
the new homologs we found.

Analysis of the MSAs revealed that the sequences corresponding to the mammalian Dscam and Dscam-like genes
(which contain homologs to fly exons 4, 9 and 17) could
be distinguished using 5–10 specific residues from each
exon. Panels A, B and C within Figure 2 show a portion of
the MSA for fly exons 4, 6 and 9, respectively. The figure
shows all of the vertebrate Dscam homologs and a single
homolog from each of the three insects. The exon 4 MSA
contains diagnostic residues at five positions: 2, 27, 33, 37
and 48 (boxed in Figure 2A): the Dscam motif for these six
residues is LIETL while the Dscam-like motif is FLQSI.
Within the exon 9 MSA the sequences corresponding to
the mammalian Dscam and Dscam-like genes can be distinguished by residues at nine positions: 13, 18, 23, 26,
30, 42 47, 49 and 51 (boxed in Figure 2B): QDTRLRAEQ
in Dscam and REMQVSTSE in Dscam-like. The exon 17

MSA contains diagnostic residues at nine different positions: 5, 7, 12, 17, 23, 30, 38, 39, and 41 (boxed in Figure
2C): LKGVLFRRR and ISDFVVKKK in Dscam and Dscamlike, respectively. These diagnostic residues can be used to
infer whether unannotated sequences belong to the mammalian Dscam or Dscam-like lineages.
Phylogenetic relationships
We obtained unrooted phylogenetic trees by Bayesian
analysis of the nucleotide sequence alignments for each of
the four exons. In each case, the position of the root is
uncertain since there is no clear outgroup sequence. These
trees are shown in Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and discussed below.
Tandem arrays for exons 4 and 17 are highly conserved
among insects
Exons 4 and 17 share similar features, as shown in Figures
3 and 4, respectively. In both trees, there is a well-supported high-level clade (clade I – magenta) that includes
the annotated Dscam exon variants from fly, mosquito
and honeybee. The clade I sequences in the exon 4 tree
also include a single unannotated sequence from fly and
mosquito.

In both trees, Clade I can be subdivided into well-supported subclades, two in exon 17 (represented by orange
and black text labels in Figure 4) and at least five subclades in exon 4, as shown in Figure 5A. Though the definition of the subclades is somewhat arbitrary, most of the
subclades are represented by at least one variant in fly,
mosquito and honeybee. The substantial depth of each
subclade relative to the shallow divergence among
sequences from fly, mosquito and honeybee suggests that
the diversification of the variant lineages within the tandem array (and, by implication, the presence of mutually
exclusive alternative splicing) long predates the divergence of these three species.
For exon 4, the position of variants from each subclade
within the array is strikingly similar in the three species, as
shown in Figure 5B. This indicates that there has been very
little turnover of exon variants for at least 243–282 million years since these three species separated [26], and
judging by the branch lengths, probably considerably
longer. This conservation in the structure of the array
strongly suggests that the subclades of alternatively
spliced variants evolved specialized functions long prior
to divergence of the insect taxa under study.
The trees for exons 4 and 17 also contain a well supported
clade (clade II – cyan) that contains only vertebrate
sequences. In both cases, Clade II can be subdivided into
two subclades. Subclade A is comprised of sequences from
the Dscam lineage (blue) and subclade B is comprised of
sequences from the Dscam-like lineage (green). The verte-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/16

brate Dscam and Dscam-like sequences are more closely
related to each other than either is to the insect Dscam
genes.
Only the exon 4 tree contains Clade III (orange) and there
is strong support (1.0 posterior probability) for the monophyly of this small clade of unannotated insect sequences.
These three sequences lie outside the annotated Dscam
exons in fly (fly homolog 01), mosquito (mosquito
homolog 01) and honeybee (honeybee homolog 01). The
branch lengths separating the annotated insect Dscam
sequences (clade I) from clades II (vertebrate sequences)
and clade III (unannotated insect sequences) are roughly
comparable.
Only insects contain homologs to exon 6
Exon 6 presents a strong contrast to exon 4 and 17. The
phylogenetic tree for exon 6 is comprised of the annotated
Dscam exon variants from fly, mosquito and honeybee,
together with unannotated sequences from these same
genomes (Figure 6). No homologous sequences were
found within the vertebrates or other non-insect genomes.
Many of the variant lineages radiate from near the midpoint of the tree and have relatively weak support. The
clustering of variants from individual species suggests that
many of the present-day variants proliferated after divergence of the insect species, or that the variants have undergone recombination.
Exon 9 has experienced high turnover since divergence of
the insects
Exon 9 is similar to exons 4 and 17 in that there is relatively good resolution of the phylogeny (Figure 7), and
sequences from vertebrates are present. However, the
turnover within the insects is, at least superficially, more
similar to the pattern seen in exon 6. There are two wellsupported high-level clades. Clade I (magenta) contains
the annotated insect Dscam exon variants and also an
unannotated sequence from the nematode, while clade II
(cyan) contains the vertebrate sequences.

The monophyly of clade I is supported by a branch with a
posterior probability of 0.99, assuming that the root is
outside the group. The species-specific clusters of exon
variants in Clade I indicate that, like exon 6, exon 9 has
undergone substantial radiation after divergence of the
insect species or that there has been recombination
among the variants. The single nematode homolog
(worm_01, circled in Fig. 7) is nested among insect
sequences within Clade I. The position of the sequence
within the clade suggests that it diverged from its closest
insect homologs after the establishment of the tandem
array. This would imply that the array was present but lost
in the Nematoda (and possibly the Deuterostomia). However, the two branches supporting this derived position

have relatively low support (0.68 and 0.55), and so the
nematode sequence could plausibly branch from a node
at the base of this clade. This latter placement would be
consistent with the origin of the array after the divergence
of the Arthropoda from the Nematoda (and Deuterostoma).
Clade II of exon 9, containing the vertebrate sequences, is
supported by a posterior probability of 0.99. As in exon 4,
the vertebrate Dscam and Dscam-like sequences are much
more closely related to each other than either is to fly
Dscam. The annotated mammalian Dscam sequences and
Dscam-like sequences can also be divided into two wellsupported subclades A and B (colored blue and green,
respectively in Figure 7) with the exception of the two
rodent Dscam sequences. Subclade A (blue) contains the
annotated human Dscam sequence and single sequences
from dog, fugu and zebrafish. Subclade B (green) contains
the annotated human and rodent Dscam-like sequences, a
second sequence from both frog and dog, and the sole
sequence from tetraodon. There is strong support for the
divergence of the single fugu sequence (fugu_01) prior to
the split between subclades A and B. Curiously, the wellsupported relationships within clade II are not entirely
consistent with the phylogeny of the vertebrates. For
example, clades containing dog and fish sequences are sister to the other mammalian sequences in both Subclades
A and B. This suggests that either the phylogenetic topol-

ogy is incorrect or that there has been a complex history of
unobserved duplications and losses.
Conservation of exon-to-protein domain correspondence
between fly and human
We identified the exons and corresponding putative protein domains for fly Dscam, Human Dscam, and Human
Dscam-L, to examine the correspondence between the
variable exons and domains. These results are shown in
Figure 8. For the fly Dscam protein, InterProScan produced a structure very similar to that shown by Schmucker
et al. [4], with nine consecutive Ig domains (SM00409)
followed by six fibronectin domains (SM00060) with
another Ig between the fourth and fifth fibronectin. Exons
4 and 6 correspond to the first part of Ig domains 2 and 3,
respectively, and exon 9 covers all of Ig domain 7. This is
followed by the transmembrane domain, corresponding
to exon 17. Uniprot annotations for human Dscam and
Dscam-L showed a highly similar domain structure to that
obtained for fly. Interestingly, for each of the fly exons and
their human homologs in both genes, the locations are
nearly identical with respect to the protein domain structure.

Discussion
The extraordinary difference between the fly and human
Dscam homologs in the extent of potential transcript
diversity motivated us to investigate the phylogenetic ori-

sequence nested with low confidence within the clade of
insect variants (Figure 7, clade I).

The origins of mutually exclusive splicing in Dscam
Homologs to all four exons were present in tandem arrays
in the insect genomes, as previously reported [4,7,8].
Three of the four exons (4, 9 and 17) also had homologs
in vertebrates, and one (exon 9) had a homolog in nematode. However, outside of the three insects that we examined, no homologs were arranged in tandem arrays. This
includes the nematode homolog to exon 9 and all the
newly identified vertebrate sequences (from zebrafish,
tetraodon, fugu, frog, and dog) from exons 4, 9 and 17.
Thus, the absence of mutually exclusive alternative splicing in the human Dscam and Dscam-like genes [14,16,27]
represents either an innovation in the lineage leading to
insects, or one or more ancient losses from the common
ancestor of insects, nematodes and vertebrates, approximately a billion years ago [26]. The one exon for which
there is any evidence of loss in the lineage leading to vertebrates is exon 9, and this is due to a single worm

We found no homologs to the alternatively spliced fly
Dscam exons within the yeast, tunicate, sea urchin and
plant genomes. For the constitutive exons that we examined, no homologs were not found in yeast or plant
genomes. However, potential homologs to several of the
constitutive exons (3, 5, 8 and 10) were found within the
tunicate and sea urchin genomes. Since the phylogeny
indicates that homologs to the fly exon 9 group must have
existed in the common ancestor of nematodes, deuterostomes and arthropods, any exon 9 homologs must have
either been lost from the sea urchin and tunicate genomes
or have diverged beyond recognition.
Differential conservation of variants within tandem arrays
in the insects
The sequences and numbers of exon variants among the
insect Dscam tandem exon arrays are all surprisingly well
conserved [8], though we found that the arrays have expe-

Comparative protein domain structure of Human Dscam, Dscam-like and fly Dscam
Comparative protein domain structure of Human Dscam, Dscam-like and fly Dscam. Based on results from
Ensembl, UniProt, and InterProScan, the four exons in fly that undergo mutually-exclusive alternative splicing are marked above
the protein subdomains (exons 4 and 6) or domains (exons 9 and 17) that they encode. The homologous exons in human
Dscam and Dscam-L are marked above their corresponding domains in the encoded proteins, with the homologous fly exon for

rienced very different patterns of proliferation and turnover. In exons 4 and 17, the variants were apparently
established in an ancient burst of invention and have
undergone relatively little turnover since divergence of the
Diptera (fly and mosquito) and the Hymenoptera (honeybee). By contrast, exons 6 and 9 appear to have undergone substantial radiation even since the more recent
divergence of fly and mosquito. Many nodes in the phylogenies of exons 6 and 9 have weak support, particularly
for the basal branches. This suggests an early period of
rapid radiation in these arrays. Alternatively, there may
have been recombination among the variants early in the
history of these two arrays. The contrast among the four
different exons suggests that, as functional units within
the Dscam gene, they are evolving largely independently
of one another.
Implications for the functional divergence of vertebrate
and insect Dscam genes
The absence of tandem arrays in any of the vertebrate
Dscam homologs indicates that they do not participate in
mutually exclusive alternative splicing and therefore lack
the diversity of protein isoforms generated through this
form of splicing. We know that the intracellular domains
of the insect and vertebrate proteins both participate in
the same signaling pathway (Pak), but by different means
[13]. As well, our results indicate strong conservation of
the exon to protein domain correspondence between fly
and the human Dscam homologs. The similarity in protein sequence of the insect and vertebrate extracellular Ig

domains (three of which are encoded by the exon arrays),
combined with recent experimental evidence for specific
homophilic interactions [10,16] suggests that the
encoded protein domains are functionally homologous.
Furthermore, an Ig domain (homologous to fly exon 6) is
absent from the human Dscam protein. These points raise
the following question: is the functionality of the diverse
Dscam protein isoforms in insects not necessary in the vertebrate homologs, or is it achieved through other means,
possibly including other forms of post-transcriptional or
post-translational processing?
The recent paper by Watson et. al, demonstrates that in the
fruit fly and other insects, mutually exclusive alternative
splicing in Dscam appears to play a role in adaptive immunity [9]. While this finding has led to the suggestion that
mutually exclusive alternative splicing in the insect Dscam
gene is solely related to its role in immunity, and not in
axon guidance [28], there is a growing body of evidence
that the alternative isoforms do in fact play a role in axon
guidance [10,12,13]. Members of the immunoglobulin
family in vertebrates are also involved in adaptive immunity, but generate protein isoform diversity through
somatic gene rearrangements rather than alternative splicing at the RNA level. Since Dscam contains immunoglobulin domains, and is now shown to be involved in
adaptive immunity in insects, there is an intriguing possibility that, in vertebrates, a diversity of protein isoforms is
achieved through somatic rearrangement of the Dscam
and Dscam-like genes.

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2006, 6:16

Other cases of mutually exclusive alternative splicing
Though tandem arrays of Dscam homologs are absent outside the insects, many other genes exhibiting alternative
splicing have been found [1,2]. For example, in humans
the neurexin and titin genes have been shown to participate in mutually exclusive splicing, [6,18,29] and the
three neurexin genes can potentially generate more than
one thousand isoforms through this process [6,18,30].
This indicates that mutually exclusive alternative splicing
can generate diverse protein isoforms in humans as it does
within insects. However, the mutually exclusive splicing
in these genes involves tandem arrays of three or fewer
variants. Where larger arrays of exons undergoing this type
of splicing have been found in vertebrates, they appear to
be confined to the first exons of the gene [21].

Conclusion
Our findings illustrate a striking contrast between the conservation of several large exon arrays in insect Dscam and
the lack of any such arrays among vertebrates. Contrary to
previous reports of high turnover [8], we found evidence
for the maintenance of ancient structural patterns within
the arrays, especially within exon 4. The four tandem
arrays show different patterns of proliferation and conservation but the weight of evidence points to all four arrays
having evolved after the divergence of arthropods from
deuterostomes and nematodes. It remains to be determined whether the contrast between insect and vertebrate
Dscam reflects functional divergence between the genes, or
whether a distinct mechanism is acting to produce a similar diversity of transcripts in vertebrates.

Methods
Sources of data
Genomes from sixteen species were used in our analyses.
These included all species that were available within
Ensembl version 20 [7,31]: Homo sapiens (human), Mus
musculus (mouse), Rattus norvegicus (rat), Danio rerio
(zebrafish), Tetraodon nigroviridis (tetraodon pufferfish),
Takifugu rubripes (fugu pufferfish), Xenopus tropicalis
(frog), Canis familiaris (dog), Drosophila melanogaster (fruit
fly), Anopheles gambiae (mosquito), Apis mellifera (honeybee), Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode), Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (yeast) and Arabidopsis thaliana (plant). We supplemented these with genome data from the tunicate,
Ciona intestinalis [32], and the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus [8], two metazoan species that diverged
intermediate to the divergence of arthropods and vertebrates, as this proved to be a critical phylogenetic junction
in our initial analysis. We did not include any of the vertebrate genomes that have since been released (e.g.
chicken, gray short-tailed opossum), as our results suggested that these would not be informative about the gain
or loss of tandem exon arrays in Dscam. Figure 1 shows the

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/6/16

phylogenetic relationships among the taxa included in
this study [26].
Identification of homologous exons
We searched genomic sequences as opposed to annotated
gene or protein databases, for two reasons. First, this
allowed us to identify both annotated and unannotated
exons. Second, since protein databases usually contain
only a single isoform for each protein [2,3], they do not
allow direct identification of tandem arrays of alternatively spliced exons. These searches were performed using
two different methods: an iterative BLAST and PSI-BLAST.

The first search method entailed iterative searches of a
database containing all the genomes using tBLASTn [33].
The fly Dscam exon splice variants 4.1, 6.11, 9.9 and 17.1
were used to seed separate searches. These variants are the
representative exons contained within the fly Dscam isoform as annotated in Genbank entry AF260530, which
serves as our primary data source. Hits with E-values less
than or equal to 0.01 were used as query sequences in successive rounds of BLAST. This process was iterated until no
new hits were obtained.
The second method entailed an initial iterated PSI-BLAST
[34] search against the NCBI nonredundant protein database to construct a position-specific scoring matrix for
each exon variant. The PSI-BLAST searches were run for a
maximum of 20 iterations using a BLOSUM62 transition
weight matrix and the default gap opening and extension
penalties of 11 and 1, respectively. Hits with E-values of
less than or equal to 0.002 were included in subsequent
iterations. The resulting position-specific scoring matrices
were then used to perform PSI-TBLASTN searches against
each of the sixteen genomes under study using the same
search parameters as for the PSI-BLAST searches. All
searches were performed with version 2.2.10 of the NCBI
BLAST tools. Search results from the different variants of
each exon were pooled and overlapping sequences were
merged.
There were no substantive differences between the results
obtained using the two methods. Those from the PSIBLAST method are reported here unless otherwise indicated.
Alignment and phylogenetic analysis
Protein multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) were constructed using ClustalW [32] and edited manually.
Sequences were included in the analysis only if they created internal gaps of fewer than 10 consecutive residues
when aligned with the annotated Dscam sequences. Only
the most conserved regions were included the final alignments, and columns containing gaps were removed. For
the protein alignments used with exons 4, 6, 9 and 17, see

Additional files 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. See Additional
file 5 for the genomic locations of the exons used in the
alignment. The corresponding nucleotide alignments
were generated using the protein alignments as guides.
Phylogenetic trees were inferred using Mr. Bayes version
3.0 [35]. Nucleotides were partitioned into three sets
based on their position within the codon. Within each set,
sites were permitted to have independently varying rates
according to a discrete gamma distribution with four
states. Five independent Markov chains were initialized
with a random tree and run for 500,000 iterations, with
trees sampled every 100 iterations. Due to a longer convergence time, the exon 9 tree was run for one million iterations with sampling every 300 iterations. The first 100
sampled trees (10,000 iterations) for exons 4, 6 and 17
and the first 133 sampled trees (39,900 iterations) for
exon 9 were discarded as "burn-in". The final trees
included only branches with posterior probability greater
than 0.5.
Domain/Exon correspondence analysis
We performed a comparison of the putative protein
domain locations versus exon locations for each of the
human homologs to fly 4, 6, 9, and 17, as shown in Figure
8. [see Additional files 6 and 7 for the alignments].

The Human Dscam and Dscam-L domains were obtained
from UniProt entries O60469 and Q8TD84, respectively
[36,37], and the exon locations were obtained from the
Ensembl annotation of proteins ENSP00000302472
(Dscam) and ENSG00000177103 (Dscam-L) [38]. The
putative domain structure for fly was obtained by combining an InterProScan [39,40] on the translated Dscam
sequence (CG17800-PA) with the domain structures
reported by Schmucker et al. and Watson et al. [4,9]. We
also performed a Smith-Waterman alignment of fly
Dscam versus Human Dscam using EMBOSS (Gap open =
10.0, extension = 0.5) [41], and added annotation corresponding to the locations of these exons and putative
domains [see Additional file 6]. The same was done for a
comparison of fly Dscam versus Human Dscam-L [see
Additional file 7].

Authors' contributions
