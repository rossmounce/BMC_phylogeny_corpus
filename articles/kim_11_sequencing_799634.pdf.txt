Abstract
Background: Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) causes chickenpox in children and shingles in older people. Currently, live
attenuated vaccines based on the Oka strain are available worldwide. In Korea, an attenuated VZV vaccine has
been developed from a Korean isolate and has been commercially available since 1994. Despite this long history of
use, the mechanism for the attenuation of the vaccine strain is still elusive. We attempted to understand the
molecular basis of attenuation mechanism by full genome sequencing and comparative genomic analyses of the
Korean vaccine strain SuduVax.
Results: SuduVax was found to contain a genome that was 124,759 bp and possessed 74 open reading frames
(ORFs). SuduVax was genetically most close to Oka strains and these Korean-Japanese strains formed a strong clade
in phylogenetic trees. SuduVax, similar to the Oka vaccine strains, underwent T- > C substitution at the stop codon
of ORF0, resulting in a read-through mutation to code for an extended form of ORF0 protein. SuduVax also shared
certain deletion and insertion mutations in ORFs 17, 29, 56 and 60 with Oka vaccine strains and some clinical
strains.
Conclusions: The Korean VZV vaccine strain SuduVax is genetically similar to the Oka vaccine strains. Further
comparative genomic and bioinformatics analyses will help to elucidate the molecular basis of the attenuation of
the VZV vaccine strains.

Background
Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is an alpha-herpesvirus and
the cause of chickenpox (varicella) and shingles (zoster).
Chickenpox is characterized by fever and generalized rash,
and is most prevalent in children due to primary infection.
VZV can establish a latent infection in nerve cells of dorsal
root ganglia and its reactivation from latency causes shingles in older adults and in immunocompromised people.
Isolation and propagation of VZV in cell culture was
first reported in 1953 [1], and the first determination of
the complete nucleotide sequence was made from the
Dumas strain [2]. As of August 2010, complete nucleotide sequences had been determined and were available

from NCBI GenBank database from 23 VZV strains
including three vaccine strains derived from the Oka
strain. Comparison of the full nucleotide sequences of
clinical with vaccine strains has enabled researchers to
suggest putative regions that might be responsible for
attenuation in vaccine strains [3-6].
In Korea, the pharmaceutical company GCC has been
manufacturing an attenuated VZV vaccine for chickenpox
since 1994. The live-attenuated vaccine strain, SuduVax®,
was obtained through serial passage of wild-type virus in
cell culture. The original wild-type virus was isolated in
primary human embryonic lung (HEL) cell culture from a
33-month-old boy with chickenpox in 1989 in Seoul,
Korea [7]. The virus was attenuated by 10 passages in HEL
cells, 12 passages in guinea pig embryonic lung cells, and
passaged five times in HEL cells to prepare an attenuated
strain, designated MAV06, for vaccine production [8]. The

attenuated viruses were stored in liquid nitrogen (master
virus banks). Working virus banks are routinely produced
after five passages of master virus bank stocks in HEL
cells. The final vaccine (SuduVax) is manufactured after
passaging of the working virus bank five times in HEL
cells.
SuduVax has been marketed in Korea since 1994 and
internationally since 1998. Although the efficacy and
safety of SuduVax have been proved in the marketplace,
molecular studies explaining the mechanism of attenuation or the efficacy of the vaccine have not been available.
In this study, the complete nucleotide sequence of SuduVax was determined and compared with those of 23 VZV
strains whose full genomic sequences are registered in
the NCBI GenBank database.

Results
Overall genome structure of the Korean vaccine strain
SuduVax

The genome of the VZV strain SuduVax was determined
to be 124,759 bp. The architecture of the SuduVax genome is typical of VZV in that the genome could be divided
into TRL, UL, IRL, IRS, US and TRS (88, 104,799, 88,
7,276, 5,232, and 7276 bp, respectively). The G + C content of the SuduVax genome is approximately 46.1%. The
lengths of the genome, lengths of each region and the G +
C contents are very similar among the 24 VZV strains
analyzed in this study (Table 1). The SuduVax genome
contains 74 ORFs. Of these 64 are UL genes and four are
US genes. Three genes in IRS (ORFs 62-64) are inversely
repeated in TRS (ORFs 69-71). Of the 74 ORFs, 39 are in
the forward direction and 35 are in the reverse direction.
The directions of ORFs are 100% conserved among the
analyzed VZV strains. The ORF map of strain SuduVax is
presented in Figure 1.
Phylogenetic analysis

Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the full nucleotide sequences of SuduVax and 23 VZV strains whose full
genomic DNA sequences are known. As shown in an
unrooted tree generated by maximum-likelihood method,
SuduVax and four Oka strains (pOka, vOka, VarilRix, VariVax) formed a clade and strains M2DR and 8 formed an
adjacent clade (Figure 2a). These two clades were joined
with the clade whose member was the strain CA123 only.
Strains 11, 22, 03-500 and HJ0 formed another clade and
the rest of the clinical strains formed the last clade. Almost
identical topology was observed in a tree generated by
neighbour-joining method (data not shown) and Bayesian
method [9]. SuduVax together with Oka strains formed a
distinctive clade, corresponding to clade 2 proposed by the
VZV Nomenclature Meeting 2008 [10]. When trees were
constructed with concatenated coding nucleotide

Page 2 of 9

sequences (ORF) or amino acid sequences, similar tree
topologies were obtained (data not shown). Next, we tried
to build phylogenetic trees using non-coding sequences.
Again, SuduVax grouped with four Oka strains, forming
clade 2 (Figure 2b). One notable difference between the
trees built by full or coding sequences and the tree built
by non-coding sequences was the location of pOka, the
parental Oka strain from which vaccine strain vOka was
derived. While pOka was located between the four vaccine
strains and 19 clinical strains in the tree built by full or
coding sequences, pOka was buried among the vaccine
strains in tree built by non-coding sequences (compare
Figures 2a, b). In other words, four vaccine strains (vOka,
VarilRix, VariVax, and SuduVax) formed a subclade within
the clade 2 in the trees built by full or coding sequences
(bootstrap value = 1,000 in neighbour-joining trees), but
not in the tree built by non-coding sequences.
In order to find which ORFs are important in distinguishing vaccine strains from clinical strains, further phylogentic analyses using individual ORF were performed.
Of the 74 phylogenetic trees, 12 ORF trees exhibited
clear branches leading to a formation of clusters consisting of vaccine strains. These 12 ORFs included ORF 0, 1,
6, 18, 31, 35, 39, 59, 62, 64, 69 and 71 (Figure 2c). The
bootstrap values for vaccine clusters were greater than
640. In majority of ORF trees, vaccine clusters formed
subclades within clade 2. However, in phylogenetic trees
based on ORFs 1, 18, 39 and 59, branches leading to
clade 2 were not present or very short with low bootstrap
values (Figure 2d). Thus, the vaccine strains did not
always form a subclade within clade 2.
Evolutionary relationships between the Korean vaccine
strain SuduVax and other VZV strains were investigated
by calculating genetic distances among the 24 VZV strains.
As a whole, VZV genome sequences were highly conserved among the strains. At the level of full nucleotide
sequences, SuduVax was the most similar to VarilRix, followed by vOka, VariVax and pOka (Table 2). Similar
results were obtained when the genetic distances were calculated using concatenated non-coding nucleotide
sequences or amino acid sequences. The average distance
between SuduVax and three vaccine strains at the full
nucleotide level was calculated to be 0.20 ± 0.05 × 10-3,
which was < 10% of the average distance between SuduVax and 20 clinical strains (2.08 ± 0.39 × 10-3, Table 2).
Among the clinical strains except for pOka, strain 8 was
the most similar to SuduVax.
Mutations found in SuduVax ORFs

SuduVax ORF0 exists as longer form due to a readthrough mutation. The stop codon TGA (nucleotide
position 388-390) was mutated to CGA coding for Arg.
A putative stop codon TGA was found downstream and

overlapped with ORF1 (Figure 3). This extended ORF0
encoded a new protein with 221 amino acid residues.
The same read-through mutation was found in other vaccine strains, vOka, VarilRix and VariVax. All clinical
strains including pOka contained 390 bp-long ORF0 coding for 129 amino acids.
Compared to the reference strain Dumas, the lengths
of ORF17 and ORF56 of the strain SuduVax were 3 bp
short due to deletion of TCA at position 367 to 369 and
TCT at position 658 to 660, respectively. Both deletions
resulted in deletion of amino acid S residue. On the
other hand, insertion of three nucleotides ATG at position 27 was found in ORF60 of the strain SuduVax.
Interestingly, the aforementioned two deletions and one
insertion were also found in all Oka strains including
pOka. SuduVax as well as Oka strains were found to
have a15 bp (AACATTTCAGGGTCA) shorter ORF29
than most clinical isolates that contain two tandem
reiterations of this 15 bp sequence. Among the clinical
strains, M2DR, CA123 and 8 contained only one copy
of the 15 bp element in ORF29. Strains M2DR and 8
shared the same length for ORF60 with Oka and SuduVax strains. Table 3 summarizes the insertion and deletion mutations found in SuduVax.

Discussion
VZV strain SuduVax has been used by a Korean pharmaceutical company to produce live attenuated vaccine for
chickenpox since 1994. Although its efficacy and safety
have been proven in the marketplace, molecular characteristics of the vaccine strain have not been available. In
this study sequencing and analyses of the nucleotide
sequence of the Korean varicella vaccine strain SuduVax
were undertaken.
In the original paper on the first complete sequencing
of VZV strain Dumas [2], 71 ORFs were proposed. However, the information obtained from the NCBI GenBank
database for Dumas (NC_001348) identifies 73 ORF if
three ORFs located in TRS are counted as separate ORFs.
Sequencing of two Oka-derived vaccine strains, VarilRix
(DQ008354) and VariVax (DQ008355), identified 72
ORFs [5]. A Blast search using these three strains as
queries produced 74 possible ORFs for VZV. We were
presently able to locate ORF45 (position 81,523- 82,593)
to Dumas and ORF33.5 to VarilRix (position 60,257 61,165) and VariVax (60,254 - 61,162). Extended from of
ORF0 due to read-through mutation was identified in
SuduVax as well as in Oka vaccine strains (see below).
Using these reference strains Dumas and VarilRix as

queries, we were able to identify and locate 74 ORFs in
the genome of the strain SuduVax as well as in other 23
VZV strains analyzed in this study.
Phylogenetic analysis using the full nucleotide
sequences of 24 VZV strains identified five distinct

clades, consistent with previous findings [9,10]. Phylogenetic trees constructed with concatenated amino acid
sequences and coding nucleotide sequences also
revealed five clades with the same members. The tree
built using non-coding nucleotide sequences appeared

in Phylip package (version 3.69). (a) ML tree based on full nucleotide sequences. (b) ML tree based on non-coding sequences. (c) NJ tree based

similar to the other trees, except that the strains 8 and
M2DR did not form a clear clade as in other trees.
SuduVax co-clustered with Oka strains and this clade
consisted exclusively of isolates from Japan and Korea in
clade 2. SuduVax shares the minimum complement of
single nucleotide polymorphism at 27 positions [10]
with other members of the clade 2. Various genotyping
methods using limited genetic information of VZV
strains have been proved to represent genotyping using
full genome information [11-15]. Any genotyping
method unequivocally placed SuduVax to the same genogroup with Oka strains as in phylogenetic trees based
on full or near-full genetic information (data not
shown).
It is not presently certain, because of the lack of full
genome sequences from other Asian isolates, whether
this clade 2 could be extended to include isolates from
other Asian countries or whether it is confined to isolates
from Japan and Korea only. However, available data

based on partial nucleotide sequences or restriction fragment length polymorphism suggest that all Korean isolates and Chinese isolates form a clade with Japanese
isolates [16,17]. Thus, it is possible that the clade 2 could
be extended to include China, which is geographically
close to Japan and Korea.
Coding sequences occupy approximately 91% of the
VZV genome and reflect most of the sequence information of the whole genome. Thus, it was expected that the
phylogenetic trees based on the coding sequences are very
similar to the trees based on the full nucleotide sequences.
We found that the coding sequence trees and amino acid
trees were similar to the full nucleotide trees. Noncoding
sequences were found to be interspersed between coding
sequences or ORFs, accounting for approximately 9% of
the VZV genome. The phylogenetic trees based on VZV
noncoding sequences are not different from those based
on full or coding nucleotide sequences or amino acid
sequences. One notable difference is the location of pOka

within clade 2. In full or coding sequence trees, pOka was
separated from four vaccine strains to form two independent subclades within clade 2. On the contrary, pOka did
not form a subclade separated from vaccine strains in noncoding sequence trees. pOka is a clinical strain. Thus, coding sequences or amino acid sequences of VZV genome
may provide information distinguishing vaccine strains
from clinical strains, while noncoding sequences does not.
Phylogenetic analyses using the nucleotide sequences
of individual ORFs suggested 12 ORFs may be important in distinguishing vaccine strains from clinical
strains. Yamanish identified 23 ORFs that are different
between pOka and Oka vaccine [6], including 12 ORFs
identified in this study. Moreover, our preliminary studies of single nucleotide polymorphism among the full
genomic DNA sequences of the 24 VZV strains revealed
12 ORFs that may be characteristic for vaccine strains
and these 12 ORFs coincide with the above-mentioned
12 ORFs [manuscript in preparation].
ORF0, also known as ORFS/L, is thought to be essential for VZV growth and encodes a membrane protein
with 129 amino acid residues, which is possibly involved

in vesicular trafficking and altering cell adhesion molecules in infected cells [18,19]. ORF0 in SuduVax was
determined to possess an extended C-terminal sequence
due to a read-through mutation of its original stop
codon TGA to CGA coding for Arg. The nearest downstream stop codon TGA was found to overlap with
ORF1 and the extended ORF0 is expected to code for a
new protein with 221 amino acid residues. Interestingly,
this read-through mutation was also found in the three
Oka-derived vaccine strains, while the stop codons were
found to be unaltered in all of the clinical strains including the parent Oka strain. In cells infected with vOka,
the extended form of ORF0 protein with 221 amino
acid residues and its spliced form with 155 amino acid
residues are expressed [20]. Since other vaccine strains,
including SuduVax, share 100% identical nucleotide
sequences within and downstream of ORF0 up to the
new stop codon, both forms of the extended ORF0 proteins are expected to be expressed in permissive cells
infected with SuduVax. Thus, read-through mutation in
ORF0 might be an important feature distinguishing vaccine strains from clinical strains.
Besides the read-through mutation in ORF0, SuduVax
share same mutational events in ORFs 17, 29, 56 and 60
with Oka strains. ORF17 codes for an mRNA-specific
RNase [21] and ORF29 encodes single strand DNA
binding protein via its zinc-finger domain [22]. The
function of ORF56 has not been well characterized, but
its gene product is reported to co-localize with regulatory protein ICP22 and nuclear protein UL3 in small,
dense nuclear bodies (NCBI, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/pubmed?Db=gene&Cmd=retrieve&dopt=full_report&list_uids=1487683. The gene product of ORF60 is glycoprotein L, which acts as a chaperon for glycoprotein
H [23]. Three bp deletions were found in ORFs 17 and
56, and an insertion of 3-bp was found in ORF60. While
most of the clinical strains contain two tandem copies of
15 bp (AACATTTCAGGGTCA) elements in ORF29,
while the SuduVax and Oka strains contain only one
copy of this 15 bp element. Of these four deletion and
insertion events, two events (ORFs 29, 60) are shared
with the clinical strains 8 and M2DR, and one event
(ORF29) is also found in the strain CA123. Since these
deletion and insertion events are also found in some of
the clinical strains including pOka, they by themselves
may not be important in attenuation, although it is still
possible that they, in combination with other events
such as read-through mutation in ORF0, may play some
roles in attenuation of vaccine strains.

Conclusion
We obtained and analyzed full nucleotide sequence of
the Korean vaccine strain SuduVax. SuduVax was
shown to be genetically most similar to Oka-derived

vaccine strains. We are now comparing the SuduVax
nucleotide and amino acid sequences with those of
other vaccine and clinical strains. Further comparative
genomic and bioinformatics analyses will help to elucidate the molecular basis of the attenuation of the VZV
vaccine strains.

Materials and methods
Virus and DNA sequencing

DNA of the VZV strain SuduVax was extracted from
commercial vials of SuduVax™ with QIAamp DNA
Mini Kit (QIAGEN) at a concentration of 5.5 μg/100
μL. The DNA sequence was determined by the high

throughput sequencing method using a Genome
Sequencer FLX Titanium System of Roche Diagnostics,
serviced by Macrogen. Sequence fragments (n =
23,722) with an average length of approximately 400
bp were obtained and these were assembled and
viewed using the Consed program http://bozeman.mbt.
washington.edu/consed/consed.html. The average quality of the sequence fragments was more than 99.99%.
A total of 99.38% of the 124,759 sequences aligned
with the derived consensus sequence and the average
coverage was 83 reads per nucleotide. These were
aligned against reference strain Dumas (NC_001348)
and vaccine strain VarilRix (DQ008354). The gaps
between the contigs were filled by polymerase chain
reaction sequencing using primers whose sequences
were obtained from the adjacent contigs. The completed sequence was deposited into NCBI GenBank
(accession number JF306641).
Allocation of ORFs

ORFs of the strain SuduVax in the full genome
sequence was located by Blast search against two reference strains Dumas (NC_001348) and VarilRix
(DQ008354). Complementary determining sequences

(CDSs) of the reference strains were extracted using
FeatureExtract 1.2 Server program http://www.cbs.dtu.
dk/services/FeatureExtract/ and used as query. The
resulting data included the first and last nucleotide positions of the each ORF in the strain SuduVax genome
and direction of the ORFs. The ORF information was verified by ORF finding programs such as CLC Sequence
Viewer (version 6.4, http://www.clcbio.com/index.php)
and ORF Finder provided by NCBI. When the results of
Blast search did not coincide with those of ORF finding
programs, the nucleotide sequences of the corresponding
ORFs were examined with BioEdit Sequence Alignment
Editor (Department of Microbiology, North Carolina State
University, version 7.0.5.3, http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/
BioEdit/bioedit.html) and manually edited to locate the
position of the start and stop codons. Finally all the allocated ORFs were confirmed by identification of the translated amino acid sequences.
Phylogenetic analysis

Nucleotide sequences of the VZV full genome other than
SuduVax were obtained directly from GenBank database
(Table 1). For each VZV strain, all ORF sequences were
cut and pasted to generate a concatenated coding
sequence. Similarly, all inter-ORF sequences were cut and
pasted to build a concatenated noncoding sequence.
Amino acid sequences were obtained by translation of the
corresponding ORFs and pasted to generate a concatenated sequence harbouring all 74 ORFs. These full or concatenated nucleotide or concatenated amino acid
sequence of the 24 VZV strains were multiple-aligned
using the ClustalW program (ver 2.0.1) followed by manual editing. The resulting out-files were used to calculate
genetic distances using Dnadist (for nucleotide) or Protdist
(for amino acid) program included in Phylip package (version 3.69, http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.
html). Distance matrix was obtained by Kimura-2-parameter for nucleotide or Jones-Taylor-Thornton method
for amino acid. Cluster analysis was performed by neighbour-joining (NJ) and maximum-likelihood (ML) method
and resulting tree files were viewed by Treeview program
(version 1.6.6). The significance of the phylogenetic trees
was verified by bootstrap analysis. Phylogenetic trees were
constructed from 1,000 replicates generated by the Seqboot program and the consensus tree was identified by the
Consense program.
