Cloning and expression of SOLD1 in ovine and
caprine placenta, and their expected roles during
the development of placentomes

Abstract
Background: The Ly-6 (Ly-6/uPAR) superfamily members share the Ly-6 domain defined by distinct disulfide
bonding patterns between 8 or 10 cysteine residues. They comprise membrane- and secretory-type proteins. We
recently reported the gene and protein characterization of the bovine secreted protein of Ly-6 domain 1 (SOLD1).
Bovine SOLD1 is expressed in trophoblast mononucleate cells (TMCs) and is localized in the cotyledonary
mesenchyme. Here, we compared the expression and functionality of SOLD1 among the ruminants. We examined
mRNA expression by chorionic fibroblasts as a measure of one of the SOLD1 functions.
Results: Ovine and caprine SOLD1 mRNAs have 303 bp open reading frames and encode for deduced SOLD1
proteins with 100 amino acids, including a 22-aa-long signal peptide at the N-terminal. Both of the SOLD1 amino
acid sequences have high similarities with the bovine sequence. Both SOLD1 mRNAs were also expressed in TMCs
of cotyledons and intercotyledonary membranes. The mature SOLD1 proteins were localized in the mesenchymal
villi of cotyledons after secretion. Bovine, ovine and caprine SOLD1 affected gene expression in mesenchymal
fibroblasts in vitro; nucleoredoxin expression was upregulated and BCL2-like 13 was downregulated. Thus, we
suggest that SOLD1 acts as a modulator of cell proliferation and apoptosis.
Conclusion: Expressing cells and protein localization of SOLD1 coincided among the three ruminants. SOLD1
participated in regulating nucleoredoxin and BCL2-like 13 expression in chorionic fibroblasts. SOLD1 is produced
specifically in the cotyledons and intercotyledonary membranes in ruminants and appears to be involved in the
construction of the ruminant placenta.

Background
We recently reported bovine secreted protein of Ly-6
(lymphocyte antigen-6, Ly-6/urokinase-type plasminogen
activator receptor, uPAR) domain 1, SOLD1, as a lining
protein that might participate in the formation of cotyledonary villi [1]. Ruminants such as cattle, sheep and
goats, have a cotyledonary placenta. Here we aimed to
explore the expression of SOLD1 in sheep and goat placentas and to clarify its roles in the ruminant placenta.
We examined gene regulation of chorionic fibroblasts
cultured with SOLD1 in vitro. We also compared
SOLD1 protein characterization and roles among sheep,
goats and cattle.

The Ly-6 domain is a 70-100 amino acid (aa) long
protein characterized by a conserved pattern of 8-10
cysteine residues with a defined pattern of disulfide
bonding [2,3]. The Ly-6 superfamily comprises membrane type glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored
proteins and secreted proteins [2,4]. The secreted members lack a GPI-anchor, such as the secreted LY6/
PLAUR domain containing 1 (SLURP1) [4], Ly6/neurotoxin 1 (LYNX1, SLURP2) [5,6], acrosomal vesicle protein 1 (ACRV1, SP10) [7,8], protein expressed in
prostate and testis (PATE) [9-11] and secreted seminal
vesicle Ly6 protein (Sslp-1) [12]. Genes for these proteins are found mainly in male reproductive tissues,
such as the prostate, testis and spermatozoa. In contrast,
bovine SOLD1 is exclusively found in female reproductive tissues and was confirmed in the placenta and the
intercotyledonary membranes [1]. No expression of

SOLD1 orthologs has been reported in human or mouse
placentas. There appears to be a Ly-6 domain protein
that is essential for placental formation in the ruminant.

Results
Characterization of mRNA and deduced protein
sequences of ovine and caprine SOLD1

We cloned cDNA sequences for ovine (ov) and caprine
(ca) SOLD1 from placentomes and identified two 303bp open reading frame cDNA sequences as ovSOLD1
and caSOLD1, respectively. The sequence deduced from
SOLD1 cDNAs had 100 aa. The N-terminal 22-aa-long
regions of both SOLD1 proteins were rich in hydrophobic aa residues characteristic of a signal peptide (Figure
1A). The SOLD1 mRNA and deduced mature regions of
aa sequences in the three ruminants (ovine, caprine and
bovine) were highly homologous at 81-95% (Figure 1A,
Table 1). The sequences had 10 cysteines (Cys) and this
configuration was identified in all three proteins (Figure
1B). There was a range of 31-71% homology among
SOLD1s with rat urinary proteins (Rup-1, Rup-2, Rup3), rat spleen protein-1 (Rsp-1), porcine protein-1 (PIP1), mouse Sslp-1 and the C-terminal regions of ACRV1
from some species, using domain alignment on data
from the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) web site
http://clustalw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-e.html (Figure 1B and
Table 1). Although low homologies in the aa sequences
were demonstrated between the Ly-6 domains, the characteristic Cys configuration was intact among all Ly-6
domains in these proteins (Figure 1B). The numbers of
potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) of each
ruminant SOLD1 differed (Figure 1A). Thus, ovSOLD1
had two consensus sequences at positions 32-34 and 8183. By contrast, caSOLD1 had only one consensus
sequence at position 32-34 and bovine (bo) SOLD1 had
three consensus sequences at positions 32-34, 60-62 and
81-83. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the ovine,
caprine and bovine SOLD1 proteins and porcine PIP-1
were phylogenetic neighbors (Figure 1C). We have submitted these sequences to the DDBJ and the DDBJ/GenBank accession Nos. are AB297496 (sheep) and
AB297497 (goat).
SOLD1 gene expression

Figure 2A depicts the tissue distributions of ovine and
caprine SOLD1 amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The mRNA appeared
only in the placenta in both species. In the sheep, no
expression was detected in the heart, liver, lung, spleen,
kidney, ovary, oviduct, uterus, testis, seminal vesicle or
prostate. In the goat, no expression was detected in the
heart, liver, lung, spleen, kidney, ovary, or uterus. Quantification of ovSOLD1 expression is depicted in Figure
2B(i). In the placentome (PTM), the ovSOLD1 expression level on day 95 of gestation was higher than on day

Page 2 of 11

45 and the expression level on day 135 was higher than
on day 95. In the intercotyledonary membrane (ICOT),
the expression on day 95 was higher than on day 45 and
remained similar on day 135. There was higher
ovSOLD1 expression in the ICOT than at the PTM in
each stage of gestation (Figure 2B(i)). In the caprine
PTM, the caSOLD1 expression intensity was similar
during the early, middle and late stages of gestation. In
the caprine ICOT, the expression level on day 90 was
higher than on day 45 and remained similar on day 140.
Levels of caSOLD1 in the ICOT were much higher than
in the PTM at each stage of gestation (Figure 2B(ii)).
These patterns of expression were common to both
species.
We determined SOLD1 mRNA localization by in situ
hybridization in ovine and caprine placentomes at days
45 and 50 of gestation in sheep and goats, respectively
(Figure 3). Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled ovSOLD1 and
caSOLD1 anti-sense RNA specifically detected the
mRNA in each species in trophoblast mononucleate
cells (TMCs) in cotyledons and in intercotyledonary
membranes. There was no expression in giant binucleate
cells (BNCs). No SOLD1 mRNA was found in the
maternal tissues (caruncles and intercaruncular regions
in the endometrium). We detected no significant signal
with the all sense probes.
We confirmed that the anti-boSOLD1 antibody was
bound to purified recombinant ovSOLD1 and caSOLD1
using western blotting (Figure 4A). The results of
immunohistochemistry on ovine and caprine placentomes using the anti-boSOLD1 antibody are shown in
Figure 4. Intense staining for SOLD1 was observed in
the mesenchymal areas of stem (primary) and branch
(secondary) villi. TMCs, –the mRNA-producing cells–
were poorly stained. No specific staining was detected in
caruncular or intercaruncular endometrium. The staining characteristics were similar in both species (Figure
4).
Gene regulation of bovine chorionic fibroblasts (BCFs) by
SOLD1

We investigated differences in the expression patterns of
the genes for nucleoredoxin (NXN) and BCL2-like 13
(BCL-Rambo, BCL2L13), in BCFs following treatment
with ovSOLD1, caSOLD1 and boSOLD1 (Figure 5). NXN
expression was upregulated by SOLD1 treatment (1.6-fold,
P < 0.05 by ovSOLD1 treatment, 1.6-fold, P < 0.05 by
caSOLD1 treatment and 1.8-fold, P < 0.05 by boSOLD1
treatment). BCL2L13 expression was downregulated by
SOLD1 treatment (0.32-fold, P < 0.05 by ovSOLD1 treatment and 0.57-fold, P < 0.05 by boSOLD1 treatment).
ovSOLD1 and boSOLD1 significantly regulated the
expression levels of these genes. However, no significant
differences were detected in BCL2L13 expression levels in
case of the caSOLD1 treatment.

Discussion
The SOLD1 genes are highly homologous among sheep,
goats and cattle, showing the general similarity of the
Ly-6 domain superfamily (Figure 1). Although the overall cross-species homology was not high for multiply
aligned polypeptides, the characteristic Cys configuration was seen consistently. These genes also encode for
some potential N-glycosylation sites. We therefore predict that these molecules have evolved from a common
phylogenetic origin. Currently, it is hard to tell whether
these genes and their products have any common functions, because Ly-6 superfamily genes have been
detected in various tissues. ACRV1, which resembles
SOLD1 structurally, is a spermatid-specific gene in several species [7,8,13,14]. Mouse Sslp-1 is also a spermatid-specific gene [12]; rat Rup-1, Rup-2 and Rup-3 are
expressed in urinary organs and rat Rsp-1 is expressed
in the spleen [15]. SOLD1 was mainly expressed in placental tissues in these ruminants (Figure 2). Expression
of PATE-P and -Q have been reported in human placental tissue [11]. However, the aa sequences of these proteins do not show high homology with SOLD1
[1,7,8,11,12,15].
Although both ovSOLD1 and caSOLD1 mRNA were
expressed in TMCs (Figure 3), their encoded proteins
were detected in mesenchymal villi (Figure 4). These
expression features of the genes and proteins are identical to that found in the bovine [1]. We predict that
the SOLD1 protein must have specific functions for
ruminants, because no homologous protein has been
found in the human or mouse to date. The cotyledonary mesenchyme is mainly composed of extracellular
matrix, mesodermal fibroblasts and vascular

endothelial cells. We have reported that boSOLD1 is
secreted to the basolateral surface in trophoblast and
is mainly bound to a tetrapeptide of type I collagen
[1]. It has been suggested that SOLD1 is an essential
protein for cotyledonary formation. However, the physiological role of SOLD1 is still unknown. Here, we
investigated the effect of SOLD1 on gene expression in
BCFs. NXN is a thioredoxin (TRX) family protein and
mainly suppresses the Wnt-beta-catenin pathway [16].
Its effect is to suppress cell proliferation. BCL2L13 is a
pro-apoptotic BCL2 family member [17] and its
expression promotes apoptosis. We found here that
NXN expression was upregulated in BCFs by exposure
to ovSOLD1, caSOLD1 or boSOLD1 and this is likely
to suppress their proliferation. In contrast, BCL2L13
was downregulated in BCFs by exposure to ovSOLD1
or boSOLD1 and this is likely to suppress apoptosis.
We suggest that SOLD1 acts as a modulator of proliferation and apoptosis in chorionic fibroblasts. We also
expect that SOLD1 will show a similar role among the
ruminants. It is known that Lypd6, SLURP1, LYNX1
and the PATE family are ligands of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) in the secreted Ly-6 family
of several tissues [6,11,18,19]. This receptor regulates
sodium and calcium ion channels. If SOLD1 acts as a
ligand of nAChR it is likely that the expression levels
of NXN and BCL2L13 are regulated via such ion channel pathways.
The trophoblast cells of the ruminant placenta are
divided into BNCs and TMCs [20]. BNCs account for
approximately 20% of the total trophoblast cell population [20]. They are directly involved in modification of
the uterine epithelium beginning at implantation and
continuing until term. BNC products, such as placental
lactogen, pregnancy-associated glycoproteins and steroid hormones, are not restricted in terms of their
direction of secretion [21-23]. Hence, the BNCs play a
pivotal role in fetal-maternal communication in ruminants. TMCs are a source of interferon-tau (IFNT),
which participates in the recognition of gestation during the peri-implantation period in ruminants. Thus
the production of IFNT is a specific role of TMCs.
However, other roles of placental TMCs are obscure.
One function might be the production of SOLD1 proteins to develop villi. The matrix metalloproteinases,
MMP2 and MMP9, are also produced by ruminant
TMCs [24]. In the human syncytiotrophoblast, MMP2
and MMP9 are secreted to the basolateral surface of
the cells and modify the basement membrane [25].
This is similar to the secretion property of SOLD1 [1].
TMCs have polarity and this might be related to the
production of a protein involved in determining the
direction of secretion.

Conclusion
In conclusion, we have identified two sheep and goat
secreted proteins, ovSOLD1 and caSOLD1, each composed only of the Ly-6 domain and a signal peptide.
Both types of SOLD1 mRNA appeared in TMCs
throughout gestation and their proteins were localized
in the mesenchyme of primary and secondary placental
villi. Phylogenetic configuration, expression and protein
localization were similar among the ruminant SOLD1
proteins and bovine SOLD1 orthologs are found in the
sheep and goat. As for the physiological role of SOLD1,
which is unknown for cattle, we examined the effects of
SOLD1 on BCFs. SOLD1 might be one of the main factors for modulating and establishing the villous
mesenchyme in ruminants through the regulation of
NXN and BCL2L13 expression in chorionic fibroblasts.
Methods
Animals and tissue collection

Placental tissues for cDNA cloning, mRNA quantitative
expression,
in
situ
hybridization
and

immunohistochemistry were collected from Corriedale
sheep and Japanese Saanen goats. The animals were
maintained in the ranch of our laboratory. For sheep,
PTM and ICOT tissues were collected on days 45 (n =
3 animals), 95 (n = 3) and 135 (n = 3) of gestation after
natural mating (designated as day 1 of pregnancy). For
the goats, placental tissues were collected on days 50 to
52 (n = 4 animals), 86 to 92 (n = 4) and 135 to 139 (n =
3) after artificial insemination (designated as day 1 of
pregnancy). These tissues were also divided into PTM
and ICOT portions. Heart, liver, lung, spleen, kidney,
ovary, oviduct and uterus tissues were collected from a
non-pregnant ewe as reference material. Testis, seminal
vesicle and prostate tissues were collected from a ram.
Heart, liver, lung, spleen, kidney, ovary and uterus tissues were collected from a non-pregnant goat.
Samples were stored at -80°C before RNA extraction.
Some placentomes were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4, embedded in
paraffin wax and stored at 4°C for in situ hybridization
and immunohistochemistry. All procedures were carried

by the Animal Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences for the use of animals.
Cloning of the coding sequence region of SOLD1 cDNA

The coding sequence regions of ovSOLD1 and caSOLD
cDNAs were isolated from cotyledonary tissues using
RT-PCR amplification. In brief, total RNA was isolated
from sheep or goat placentomes using ISOGEN (Nippon
Gene, Toyama, Japan). DNase treatment for the genomic DNA removal was performed using TURBO DNAfree kits (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). The total RNA in
a reaction mixture was used for RT and template cDNA
synthesis using oligo(dT) primers and Superscript III
reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at

50°C for 50 min. We performed PCR with common
SOLD1-specific primers used for ruminants (Table 2).
The SOLD1 primers were designed based on the
hypothetical bovine protein LOC100125878 sequences
(GenBank reference accession number NM_001105478).
The products were sequenced using an ABI Prism 370
automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA, USA) after cloning into a pGEM-T Easy vector
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
Multiple alignment of the deduced protein sequences

The deduced ovSOLD1, caSOLD1 and boSOLD1 protein sequences were aligned using the multiple alignment software ClustalW 1.83 on the DDBJ web site
http://clustalw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/top-j.html using the

neighbor-joining (NJ) method with Kimura distance
[26,27]. Domain retrieval of the SOLD1 protein was performed using the ProDom web site http://prodomweb.
univ-lyon1.fr/prodom/current/html/home.php. Ruminant
SOLD1 and some secreted Ly-6 domain sequences were
also aligned using ClustalW 1.83. TreeView software
was used to display the phylogenetic tree [28]. The
values represent bootstrap scores for 10,000 trials, indicating the credibility of each branch.
RT-PCR

The tissue distributions of ovSOLD1 and caSOLD1
mRNA expression were studied using RT-PCR with
GAPDH as a positive control [29,30]. The total RNA in
a reaction mixture was used for reverse transcription
and template cDNA synthesis using oligo(dT) primers
(Table 2) and Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 50°C for 50 min. Each PCR contained the
cDNA template, primers, autoclaved MilliQ water and
AmpliTaq Gold PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems).
Amplification conditions were an initial denaturation
step at 95°C for 10 min, 26 cycles of denaturation at 95°
C for 30 sec, annealing at 57°C for 30 sec, extension at
72°C for 1 min and a final extension step at 72°C for 10
min. The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel
electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide
staining. The same primers encoding the SOLD1
sequence were used for cDNA cloning (Table 2; Tsukuba Oligo Service, Tsukuba, Japan).
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)

bovine chorionic fibroblasts (BCFs) treated with and without
SOLD1. Expression levels were measured by real-time quantitative
RT–PCR. (A) Nucleoredoxin (NXN) expression. (B) BCL2-like 13
(BCL2L13) expression. Expression levels of these mRNAs were
normalized to that of GAPDH measured in the corresponding RNA
preparation. Values are shown as the mean ± SEM; *P < 0.05.

Expression levels of ovSOLD1 and caSOLD1 were confirmed quantitatively at each stage of gestation by qRTPCR using the Power SYBR Green PCR master mix
(Applied Biosystems). Fifty nanogram aliquots of total
RNA were reverse-transcribed into cDNA for 30 min at
48°C using MultiScribe reverse transcriptase with a random primer, dNTP mixture, MgCl2 and RNase inhibitor
followed by heat inactivation of the reverse transcriptase
for 5 min at 95°C. In the SYBR Green assay, primer
pairs were designed using the Primer Express software
program (Applied Biosystems). The primers for each
gene are listed in Table 3. Cycling conditions included
initial incubation at 50°C for 2 min and 95°C for 10
min, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for

1 min. The resulting relative increase in reporter fluorescent dye emission was monitored in real time using
an Mx3000P QPCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA,
USA). The relative differences in the initial amounts of
each cDNA species were determined by comparing the
threshold cycle (C T ) values. Standard curves for each
gene were generated by serial dilution of each plasmid
containing the corresponding cDNA to quantify the
mRNA concentrations. We confirmed the dissociation
curve for detecting the SYBR Green-based objective
amplicon, because SYBR Green also detects any doublestranded DNA including primer dimers, contaminating
DNA and PCR products from misannealed primers.
Thus, contaminating DNA or primer dimers would
show up as a peak separate from the desired amplicon
peak. The expression ratio of each gene to GAPDH
mRNA was calculated to adjust for variations in the
qRT-PCR reaction. All values are presented as the mean
± SEM. Replications of qRT-PCR data were performed
on samples from three or four animals and technical
duplicates were done from each animal sample (six or
eight data points in total). Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA followed by the TukeyKramer multiple-comparison test. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05.
In situ hybridization

ovSOLD1 and caSOLD1 cDNA were used as templates
for hybridization probe synthesis. DIG-labeled antisenseand sense-complementary RNA probes were prepared
using DIG RNA labeling kits (Roche Diagnostics, Basel,
Switzerland) and the cloned coding sequence region of
ovSOLD1 or caSOLD1 cDNA in plasmids as described
[29,30]. Placentomes were sectioned at 7 μm and in situ
hybridization was performed using an automated Ventana HX System Discovery with a RiboMapKit and

Page 9 of 11

BlueMapKit (Ventana, Tucson, AZ, USA). Briefly, ovine
and caprine sections were hybridized with DIG-labeled
probes in RiboHybe (Ventana) hybridization solution at
68°C (for ovSOLD1) or 61°C (for caSOLD1), for 6 h. The
sections were washed three times in RiboWash (Ventana) (68°C for ovSOLD1 or 61°C for caSOLD1, 6 min
each) after hybridization and fixed in RiboFix (Ventana)
(37°C, 10 min). The hybridization signals were then
detected using anti-digoxin monoclonal antibody-biotin
conjugates (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). Counterstaining was done with nuclear fast red (Ventana).
The hybridized slides were observed using a Leica
DMRE HC microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar,
Germany) equipped with a DS-Fi1 digital camera and a
DS-L2 control unit (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).
Production and purification of recombinant proteins

The ovSOLD1, caSOLD1 and boSOLD1 sequences
encoding the mature protein region (aa 23-100), which
included the FLAG and 6× His epitope tag sequences,
were inserted into a pFLAG-CMV-3 vector (SigmaAldrich). The constructed plasmid was transfected into
HEK 293 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche). Stably transfected HEK 293 cells were adapted to suspension culture
in a spinner flask using 293 SFM II medium (Gibco,
Invitrogen) and cultured in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in
air at 37°C for three days. The medium was separated
from cells by centrifugation.
Recombinant FLAG-tag and 6× His-tag fusion proteins were purified using the 6× His-tag portion.
Approximately 1 l of conditioned medium was processed at a time. Medium to which 1 ml Ni Sepharose 6
Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire,
UK) was added was mixed and equilibrated with 20 mM
sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 300 mM
NaCl and 20 mM imidazole. Only the 6× His-tag

proteins bind to the Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow carrier.
The medium with carrier was chromatographed on a
PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The fractions
with carrier were washed with 20 mM imidazole. The
fractions were eluted with 250 mM imidazole.
Immunohistochemistry

Immunohistochemistry was performed using an automated Ventana HX System Discovery with DabMapKit
reagents (Ventana). Custom-made anti-bovine SOLD1
(anti-boSOLD1) antibody was used for immunohistochemistry. The mature boSOLD1 region (aa 23-100)
involving the epitope was used for raising antigen in
rabbits (Operon Biotechnology, Tokyo, Japan) [1]. The
antibody’s quality and specificity was confirmed with the
purified recombinant ovine and caprine SOLD1 protein,
respectively, using western blotting analysis. For immunohistochemistry, the sections were incubated with antiboSOLD1 antibody and preimmune serum (negative
control) at a dilution of 1:100 in Ab Diluent (Ventana)
for 4 h. The sections were then washed and incubated
with an anti-rabbit IgG-Biotin conjugate at a dilution of
1:500 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h. Immunoreactive signals
were detected using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) and diaminobenzidine (DabMapKit, Ventana).
Counterstaining was done with hematoxylin and bluing
reagent (saturated lithium carbonate solution). After
treatment, the sections were observed using a Nikon
Eclipse E800 photomicroscope equipped with a DS-Fi1
digital camera and a DS-L2 control unit (Nikon, Tokyo,
Japan).
SOLD1 treatment of bovine chorionic fibroblasts (BCFs)
and gene expression analysis

BCFs were prepared as follows. Bovine cotyledons were
collected from a pregnant cow (Japanese Black) at day
64 after insemination. The cotyledonary tissues were
dissected aseptically from the surrounding tissues. Small
pieces of tissues were incubated for 1 h at 37°C in an
atmosphere of 5% CO 2 in air in Dulbecco’s Modified
Eagle Medium (DMEM)/Ham’s Nutrient Mixture F12
(F12) 1:1 medium mixture supplemented with 20% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (DFF20 medium) containing 0.1%
collagenase (Wako, Osaka, Japan). The cell suspension
was centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min and washed twice
with DFF20 medium. The cells were incubated in T-25
flasks (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) for 1 h
at 37°C in DFF20 The cell suspension was moved to
type-I collagen coated T-25 flasks (BD Biosciences) and
incubated for 10 days at 37°C in DFF20. The medium
was replaced twice during this period. The medium was
removed and the cells were washed with PBS. The cells
were then treated with trypsin-EDTA (0.05% trypsin and
0.53 mM EDTA; Gibco, Invitrogen). The suspended
fibroblasts were cultured and the remaining adhesive

Page 10 of 11

epithelial cells were discarded. The fibroblasts were
established based on trypsin sensitivity over twelve
passages.
Cell synchronization of the BCFs was performed
prior to ovSOLD1, caSOLD1 or boSOLD1 treatment.
Thymidine (2 mM final concentration) was added to
the cell suspension (density 2 × 10 5 ) in DMEM/F12
1:1 supplemented with 10% FBS (DFF10 medium) and
the cells were incubated for 12 h at 37°C under 5%
CO 2 in air. The cells were placed in thymidine-free
DFF10 with the same atmosphere to exit from the S
phase after being washed with FBS free DMEM/F12
medium. Mimosine (400 μM final concentration) was
added to the cell suspension in DFF10 medium and
the cells were incubated for 12 h further at 37°C under
5% CO2 in air. The cells were arrested at the G1/S cell
cycle boundary prior to each SOLD1 treatment [31].
Eight T-25 flasks containing the synchronized cells
were prepared for each SOLD1 treatment and negative
controls. The ovSOLD1, caSOLD1 or boSOLD1 (final
concentration 10 ng/ml in DMEM/F12) was added to
six of the flasks and incubated for 2 d at 37°C under
5% CO2 in air. Negative controls were incubated without SOLD1 in the same conditions. RNA was isolated
from all cells using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene). Expression levels of NXN and BCL2L13 were confirmed
quantitatively by qRT-PCR as above. Primer sequences
for bovine NXN, BCL2L13, and GAPDH are listed in
Table 3. Statistical analysis was performed using Student’s t-tests and differences were considered significant at P < 0.05.
