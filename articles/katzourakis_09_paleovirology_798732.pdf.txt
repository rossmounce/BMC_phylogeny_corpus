Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) result from permanent
germline insertion of exogenous retroviruses within host
genomes, and are abundant within mammalian genomes.
The overwhelming majority of ERVs possess a relatively
simple genomic organisation, lacking many of the accessory genes found in the more complex retroviruses. Furthermore, insertions prior to the radiation of mammalian
orders lack closely related present day circulating exogenous counterparts. Foamy viruses (also termed Spumaviruses) are a superfamily of complex retroviruses that
possess distinctive replication features, and are of great
interest as both biological markers of zoonotic exposure
risk and as candidate vectors for stem cell gene therapy.
Despite a long evolutionary association with mammals,
endogenous counterparts of infectious foamy viruses have
been notably absent from mammalian genomes. We have
discovered the first endogenous foamy virus (SloEFV) in
the genomes of sloths (superorder: Xenarthra). SloEFV
represents the first complex retrovirus to be described
from the basal Xenarthran mammalian group. By determining the taxonomic distribution of related viruses in
other Xenarthrans, and using bioinformatic approaches,
we establish that SloEFV invaded sloth genomes prior to
the colonization of continental South America by
Boreoeutherian mammals. This observation, combined
with exact congruence of branching order and statistically
significant association of divergence between foamy virus
and mammalian phylogenies, supports an extended
cospeciation scenario under which foamy viruses remarkably similar to contemporary strains circulated in ancestral mammals >100 million years ago and diverged in

concert with their hosts throughout the Cenozoic Era. Our
discovery provides the first direct evidence for ancient and
mammalian-wide origins of complex retroviruses, highlighting the role of evolutionary constraint in maintaining
viral genome structure. We propose that the evolution of
retroviral accessory genes and mammalian mechanisms of
innate immunity are the products of a macroevolutionary
conflict played out over a geological timescale. Furthermore, the extended coevolutionary relationship revealed
by our analysis has implications for models of viral crossspecies transmission and emergence.
