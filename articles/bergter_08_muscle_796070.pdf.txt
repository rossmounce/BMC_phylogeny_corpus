Abstract
Background: The standard textbook information that annelid musculature consists of
oligochaete-like outer circular and inner longitudinal muscle-layers has recently been called into
question by observations of a variety of complex muscle systems in numerous polychaete taxa. To
clarify the ancestral muscle arrangement in this taxon, we compared myogenetic patterns during
embryogenesis of Ophryotrocha diadema with available data on oligochaete and polychaete
myogenesis. This work addresses the conflicting views on the ground pattern of annelids, and adds
to our knowledge of the evolution of lophotrochozoan taxa.
Results: Somatic musculature in Ophryotrocha diadema can be classified into the trunk, prostomial/
peristomial, and parapodial muscle complexes. The trunk muscles comprise strong bilateral pairs
of distinct dorsal and ventral longitudinal strands. The latter are the first to differentiate during
myogenesis. They originate within the peristomium and grow posteriorly through the continuous
addition of myocytes. Later, the longitudinal muscles also expand anteriorly and form a complex
arrangement of prostomial muscles. Four embryonic parapodia differentiate in an anterior-toposterior progression, significantly contributing to the somatic musculature. Several diagonal and
transverse muscles are present dorsally. Some of the latter are situated external to the longitudinal
muscles, which implies they are homologous to the circular muscles of oligochaetes. These circular
fibers are only weakly developed, and do not appear to form complete muscle circles.
Conclusion: Comparison of embryonic muscle patterns showed distinct similarities between
myogenetic processes in Ophryotrocha diadema and those of oligochaete species, which allows us
to relate the diverse adult muscle arrangements of these annelid taxa to each other. These findings
provide significant clues for the interpretation of evolutionary changes in annelid musculature.

Background
Recent molecular and morphological studies have dramatically changed our understanding of the phylogenetic

relationships between major taxonomic divisions of bilaterally symmetrical animals (Bilateria). Most bilaterian
taxa are now grouped into three major clades: deuteros-

tomes, ecdysozoans and lophotrochozoans [1,2]. This
phylogenetic rearrangement has stimulated new scientific
interest in lophotrochozoan taxa in particular, as this
group of phyla has lacked well-studied model organisms.
In order to address general evolutionary questions about
Bilateria, we need to better understand the morphology
and embryonic development of lophotrochozoan taxa,
such as annelids [3-12].
Our work focuses on the comparative analysis of annelid
muscle formation during embryogenesis, in order to
expand the developmental and morphological knowledge
base for annelids, and consequently, for Lophotrochozoa
in general [6-8]. We studied myogenesis using cLSM (confocal laser scanning microscopy) analysis of fluorescently
labeled phalloidin, which binds to F-actin of muscles.
This approach has proved to be a powerful method to
study muscular arrangements in many soft-bodied taxa
[13-18].
The ground pattern of the annelid musculature is generally assumed to comprise an outer layer of homogeneous
circular and an inner layer of longitudinal muscles, as is
characteristic for oligochaete annelids. This model was
originally developed in the 19th century, and has become
well-established textbook information [19-23]. A corollary of this model is the theory that the ancestral annelid
stem species was a soil-dwelling animal in which such
muscles, along with other morphological characteristics,
would have facilitated burrowing into the soil by peristaltic movement [24-27]. This view of the basal annelid has,
however, been recently challenged by proposals that the
ancestral annelid was an aquatic, epibenthic animal, bearing parapodia – that is, polychaete-like [28,29].
Recent cLSM analyses, particularly of polychaete muscle
patterns, have attempted to resolve these contradictory
understandings of the evolutionary history of annelids.
This work has clearly revealed that the homogenous circular and longitudinal muscle layers characteristic of oligochaetes are rarely found in polychaetes. Instead, a variety
of other muscles exist in polychaetes in addition to longitudinal and circular fibers, including parapodial, diagonal, dorsoventral, chaetal, bracing and oblique muscles
(the latter passing through the body cavity) [30-33]. Longitudinal muscles in polychaetes are arranged in distinct
bands separated by considerable lateral gaps. Ventrally,
they comprise two prominent ventrolateral muscle bands,
plus a thin medial band just dorsal to the ventral nerve
cord [33]. The number of dorsal longitudinal muscles is
more variable, but one bilateral pair seems to be the most
common pattern [34]. Complete circular muscles can be
found in species of Glyceridae, Capitellidae, Maldanidae,
and Arenicolidae [33,34], but circular muscles bands are
incomplete in Nereididae and even absent in species of

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/1

Aphroditidae, Chrysopetalidae, Nerillidae, Pisionidae,
Spionidae and Opheliidae [32,33]. In Dorvillea kastjani
(Dorvilleidae) the circular muscles are restricted to the
spaces between the parapodia [31].
The complex muscle patterns of polychaetes and the uniform muscle layers present in oligochaetes apparently
bear little resemblance to each other, which hampers
direct comparison of these muscle systems. However, our
studies on myogenesis in the oligochaetes Enchytraeus coronatus (Enchytraeidae) and Limnodrilus sp. (Tubificidae),
revealed some similarities between muscle patterns in oligochaete embryos and those of adult polychaetes [6,7].
Both oligochaete species displayed distinct dorsal and
ventral bilateral pairs of muscle strands at the onset of
muscle formation, similar to the longitudinal muscles
characteristic of polychaetes. The characteristic complete
layer of longitudinal muscles in adults of these two species forms later during development, by addition of secondary strands. Initially, circular muscles form
ventrolaterally in a repetitive pattern at the posterior margin of posterior body segments.
It is therefore apparent that comparative studies of muscle
development in annelids (rather than adult musculature
alone) may identify characteristic features of oligochaetes
and polychaetes that could significantly improve our
understanding of muscle arrangement in annelids, and
annelid evolution [7,34]. Current annelid phylogeny
remains poorly resolved, which considerably hampers our
ability to draw conclusions about potential plesiomorphic states in annelids [2,21,28,29,35-39]. A solid knowledge of morphology and development from a diverse
sampling of annelid taxa will deepen our knowledge of
plesiomorphic or apomorphic characteristics. This new
information, in combination with a reliable annelid phylogeny, will enable us to interpret and determine the
direction of evolutionary events in this important group.
Ophryotrocha diadema
The primary aim of this work is to compare patterns of
myogenesis in a polychaete species with those known to
occur in oligochaetes, in order to help clarify the ancestral
muscle pattern of annelids. The morphology and life history of Ophryotrocha diadema (Dorvilleidae), previously
described by Bertil Åkesson [40], resembles the postulated
polychaete-like stem species described above. These are
small, interstitial worms that inhabit shallow marine
environments. Adults of this species grow to a maximum
length of 4–5 mm, generally with fewer than 25 segments.
The head is flattened and bears one dorsal pair of small
antennae. Two ciliary bands, the acrotroch and prototroch, mark the prostomium. Posterior to the stomodeum are two additional rings of cilia belonging to the
peristomium, the anterior one the metatroch. The second

ring encircles a segment-like annulus of the peristomium,
which lacks parapodia (unlike a "true" segment), and is
characteristic of Ophryotrocha [41,42]. Each chaetae-bearing body segment, (chaetiger), is surrounded by a ciliary
band, which persist throughout life and are used for
swimming. The parapodia are uniramous and simple,
without any lobes or cirri. They possess aciculae (specialized internal chaetae) and a small number of chaetae (Fig.
1D,F). The pygidium bears a pair of cirri and the dorsally
situated anus.
Embryos of O. diadema are lecithotrophic, and develop
within an egg case, lacking a free-swimming larval stage.
Although embryos of O. diadema pass through a stage similar to the trochophore larva characteristic of polychaetes,
this is not a free-living stage, nor do a number of chaetigerous segments arise simultaneously through metamorphosis, as in polychaetes with free-living trochophores
[3,43]. Instead, development within the egg case proceeds
with the formation of four chaetigerous segments one by
one, prior to hatching. Thus, O. diadema undergoes direct
development, and lacks a need for special larval musculature. This trait facilitates comparison with patterns of
muscle development in the investigated oligochaetes,
which likewise develop directly within a cocoon, and lack
a free-living larval stage.

muscle strand runs straight from the anterior pole to the
posterior pole, decreasing in thickness, and terminating
within the cirri or the pygidium. An additional, considerably thinner longitudinal muscle (mVLM) runs down the
midline, just dorsal to the ventral nerve cord (vnc) (Fig.
1B,C,G and Fig. 2A). Transverse (tm) and diagonal muscles (dm) are evenly distributed over the dorsal side, running either below or above the longitudinal muscles (Fig.
1A,E–G). Some of these dorsal diagonal muscles are part
of the parapodial muscle complex (Fig. 1G, adPM, pdPM,
described below); others span the body laterally from the
dorsal towards the ventral longitudinal muscle either
anterior or posterior to the parapodia. On the ventral side,
diagonal muscles are absent and transverse muscles are
only weakly developed (Fig. 3D, tm). The only transverse
fibers found here are present in the anterior portion of a
body-segment. Three small muscles stretch from each of
the ventral longitudinal muscles (VLM, mVLM) toward
the anterior ventral region of each body-segment (Fig.
3A,C–D, asterisk).
Prostomial and peristomial musculature
The peristomium is dominated by strongly developed
pharyngeal muscles (phar). They form a ventrally situated
basket-like structure consisting of several layers in which
the muscle fibers run in various directions, the outermost
layer consisting of longitudinal fibers (Fig. 1A and 2A).

Results
Adult musculature
Embryos were classified into developmental stages
according to the number of ciliary bands and chaetigers
rather than time post-fertilization, as the timing of developmental events can vary considerably with environmental conditions and parental brooding (own observation).
To provide information about the 3-dimensional arrangement of the musculature, we used depth-coded false-color
cLSM projections.
Trunk musculature
The prominent musculature of the trunk in Ophryotrocha
diadema comprises two bilateral sets of longitudinal muscles, the dorsal longitudinal muscles (DLM) and the ventral longitudinal muscles (VLM) (Fig 1A,B,DF and Fig.
2A). The dorsal longitudinal muscle is composed of distinguishable muscle strands. Of these, the innermost
strand runs diagonally towards the dorsal midline where
it crosses its bilateral counterpart (Fig. 1A, circle). This pattern is repeated posterior from the second chaetiger
onwards. The longest longitudinal muscle strands reach as
far as a transverse muscle anterior of the dorsally situated
anus (Fig. 1A, tagged arrow).

The ventral longitudinal muscles (VLM) are formed by a
thick assemblage of muscle fibers ventrolaterally, separated by a medial gap (Fig. 1D,F–G and Fig. 2A). Each

Most prostomial muscles arise from anterior elongations
of the dorsal and ventral longitudinal muscles, forming a
complex network in the head of the worm. All muscles
described here are bilaterally paired unless otherwise
noted, and are depicted in Figure 2B–E. The ventral portion of the ventral longitudinal muscles (VLM) extends
straight toward the anterior pole of the prostomium;
therefore we have termed these the straight ventral longitudinal muscles (sVLM). At the anterior, they separate into
several flattened bands, each connecting with its bilateral
partner. The dorsal portions of each ventral longitudinal
muscle (VLM) separate at the anterior border of the peristomium and run diagonally (dVLM), crossing each other
midway to the anterior pole. Here they connect with the
straight ventral longitudinal muscles (sVLM). A pair of
delicate longitudinal muscles originates from the diagonal ventral longitudinal muscles (dVLM) at their intersection point. These small muscles project ventrally towards
the anterior pole, branching repeatedly along the way
(Fig. 2B–D, circles).
Just anterior to the pharyngeal muscle complex, the dorsal
longitudinal muscle (DLM) separates into four main
strands. The three outer strands extend directly to the
anterior. Of these three, the outer dorsal strand (oDLM)
reaches the farthest and connects with the straight ventral
longitudinal muscles (sVLM) and the diagonal ventral

The dorsal longitudinal muscle (DLM) and the anterior (adPM) and posterior dorsal parapodial muscles (pdPM) have been removed from the reconstruction of the right side of the body, to expose underlying muscles. Chaetal
(chm) and acicular muscles (am) form the center of the parapodium. The outer anterior parapodial muscle (oaPM) stretches
anteriorly, terminating in the vicinity of the VLM. The inner anterior parapodial muscle crosses the body-cavity and ends at the
opposite side (iaPM). Both posterior parapodial muscles (ipPM, opPM) terminate at the midline in close proximity to the
median ventral longitudinal muscle (mVLM). Here, the ipPM, opPM, iaPM of two adjoining pairs of parapodial muscle complexes

longitudinal muscles (dVLM), forming an anterior muscle
cap (Fig. 2D). The middle dorsal longitudinal muscle
(mDLM) is shorter and ends three-quarters of the way
into the prostomium, while the inner muscle strand
(iDLM) terminates about one-third of the way into the
prostomium. The innermost (central) dorsal strand
(cDLM) crosses toward the opposite side, intersecting
with its bilateral counterpart.
One major prostomial transverse muscle (PStm1) crosses
just anterior to the intersecting central dorsal longitudinal
muscles (cDLM), running between the dorsal and ventral
longitudinal muscles. One branch of this transverse muscle ends within the antennae. A second transverse muscle
(PStm2) is thinner than the first prostomial transverse
muscle (PStm1), and is situated dorsal to the dorsal longitudinal muscles.
Parapodial musculature
The majority of muscles present within the body segments
belong to the parapodial muscle complexes. One such
muscle complex is depicted in Figure 3. In the distal part
of the parapodium, the chaetae are surrounded by chaetal
muscles (chm), which form a long and slender crown of
numerous thin muscle strands. A similar muscle crown
encloses the aciculae. These special bristles do not penetrate the body wall, but support the chaetae. The acicular
muscles (am) are strongly developed, originating from the
base of the aciculae near the midline, and reaching into
the proximal portion of the parapodium. There, the muscles divide into several filiform strands. The chaetal and
the acicular muscles do not appear to have direct contact
with each other.

The muscles responsible for the movement of the parapodia are the outer anterior and posterior parapodial muscles (oaPM and opPM, respectively) as well as the inner
anterior and posterior parapodial muscles (iaPM and
ipPM). These muscles terminate at the distalmost region
of the parapodium. The outer anterior muscle (oaPM) is
the shortest. It originates in the region of the ventral longitudinal muscle, whereas the inner anterior muscle
(iaPM) crosses the ventral midline, having its origin at the
opposite ventral longitudinal muscle. Both anterior muscles branch at the base of the parapodium. These secondary branches run diagonally – ventrally, distally and
posteriorly from the chaetal muscles.
The posterior parapodial muscles both proceed straight to
the ventral midline of the body, where they terminate. The
posterior parapodial muscles intersect with the inner anterior muscle of the subsequent segment at a single point on
the ventral midline, along with the median ventral longitudinal muscle (Fig. 3A,B, circle). Less prominent are a set
of anterior and posterior dorsal parapodial muscles

(adPM, pdPM) which enter the parapodium from the dorsal side (Fig. 3B and Fig. 1G). They do not reach the distal
tip of the parapodium but end halfway down its length.
Muscle formation during embryogenesis
Onset of muscle formation
The first discernable muscle fibers become apparent after
gastrulation has taken place, during a stage that appears
very similar to a trochophore larva, despite the fact that O.
diadema has no free-living larval stage. At this point, the
major landmarks on the embryo are the ciliary bands and
developing nervous system. From anterior to posterior, 4
ciliary bands are clearly visible: the prototroch (prot),
metatroch (met), an additional peristomial ciliary band
(pcb) and the telotroch (tel) of the pygidium. The first ciliary band (1BS) of the anteriormost body segment is
present, but only weakly developed (Fig. 4A). Posterior to
the metatroch, a longitudinally directed ciliary band –
known as the neurotroch or gastrotroch – extends along
the ventral midline of the embryo. The anlage of the brain
(Fig. 4A, arrow), with its circumoesophageal connectives
and the first commissure, form a circle around the mouth
opening (stom) (Fig. 4A). Adjacent to the lateral margins
of the mouth opening, the first fibers of the ventral longitudinal muscles (VLM) become visible (Fig. 4A–C).
One chaetigerous ciliary band
With time, the embryo lengthens and the mandibles of
the jaw apparatus (ja) become discernable due to weak
autofluorescence (Fig 5E). The dorsal and ventral longitudinal muscle strands (DLM, VLM) elongate towards the
posterior, reaching the pygidium at the end of this developmental stage (Fig. 5B,E,H). They consist of distinct fiber
bundles, which decrease in thickness from anterior-toposterior. The pair of ventral longitudinal muscles forms
an anterior loop, with three terminal spikes at the ventral
midline in front of the mouth opening (Fig. 5E). These
represent the first muscles of the protostome, which correspond with the diagonally running ventral longitudinal
muscles (dVLM) mentioned above (Fig. 2B–D).

At this stage, the first transverse muscles of the body segments begin to differentiate ventrally, in close proximity
to the ventral longitudinal muscles (Fig. 5E,H, arrows).
They extend towards the dorsal longitudinal muscles and
the ventral midline, and are situated in a sublongitudinal
position, i.e. deep to the longitudinal muscles (Fig. 6B)
and are the anlage of the anterior and posterior parapodial muscles (pma). These muscles display a repetitive
pattern with respect to the primordial body segments,
such that a transverse fiber is always present directly anterior and another directly posterior to a ciliary band (Fig.
5B–H and Fig. 6A–E, arrows). Early signs of (autofluorescent) chaetae are already visible in what will become first
three body segments. These emerge just anterior to chaeti-

gerous ciliary bands, which mark the posterior margins of
body segments at this developmental stage (Fig. 5H).
Chaetae develop in an anterior to posterior progression,
so the more posterior ones represent an earlier stage of
development than those in anterior segments.
Two chaetigerous ciliary bands
As the body of the embryo continues to elongate, the ciliary band of the second body segment becomes recognizable (Fig. 6A). A fully circular muscle also forms within the
pygidium at this time (Fig. 6C, tagged arrow), which
marks the posteriormost extent of the dorsal and ventral
longitudinal muscles.

The median ventral longitudinal muscle (mVLM) differentiates along the ventral midline. Unlike the lateral ventral longitudinal muscles (VLMs), the median ventral
longitudinal muscle (mVLM) appears not to grow from
anterior to posterior, but instead coalesces from primor-

dia at various points along the AP axis (Fig. 6C). Anteriorly, its muscle fibers form a V that laterally encloses the
mouth opening, and interlaces with the muscle fibers of
the pharyngeal muscle complex (phar).
The initial thin fibers of the pharyngeal muscles already
display the basketlike shape of the adult and range from
the mouth opening to the anterior border of the first
body-segment (Fig. 6E). The diagonal ventral longitudinal
muscles of the prostomium (dVLM) have elongated farther to the anterior (Fig. 6C). Additionally, the straightrunning ventral longitudinal muscles (sVLM) elongate
from the ventral longitudinal muscles in the trunk
towards the anterior pole, entering the prostomium on
each side (Fig. 6C).
Three to four chaetigerous ciliary bands
From here, the main events in myogenesis prior to hatching are the continued development of the prostomial

muscles and the formation of the parapodial muscles in
the first four chaetigers. The most prominent muscles of
the prostomium are still the diagonal ventral longitudinal
muscles (dVLM) (Fig. 7A–B and Fig. 8A). The middle
branch of this muscle remains relatively thin, while the
outer branches increase in thickness. They have already
formed the connection with the straight ventral and the
outer dorsal longitudinal muscles (Fig. 8D). However, the
latter are only weakly developed at this stage, and the
anterior muscle cap is not completely developed before
hatching.
As all four embryonic chaetigers develop in an anterior-toposterior progression, it is possible to examine different
stages of parapodial development in one specimen. Initially, the anlage of the parapodia can be distinguished by
the presence of autofluorescent chaetae and aciculae (Fig.
7A,B). The first parapodial muscles are the inner anterior
and posterior muscles (iaPM, ipPM). Together with the
outer and dorsal parapodial muscles (oaPM, opPM,
adPM, pdPM) these muscles elongate into the distal tip of
the parapodium, forming a conical array. Aciculae and
chaetae are closely apposed within the proximal portion
of the parapodium. Here, the chaetal and acicular muscles
begin their development in direct contact with both types
of bristles. During further parapodial development, the
different bristle types are pulled apart as the acicular muscles shift toward the ventral midline.

Discussion
This work is part of a series investigating annelid myogenesis with respect to its implications for the ground pattern
of annelid musculature [6,7]. While a variety of patterns
in adult polychaete musculature have been described elsewhere [30-34,37,44], the emphasis of the present analysis
is on polychaete myogenesis, as polychaete and clitellate
musculatures become more readily comparable when
examined in a developmental context.
Longitudinal and Prostomial Muscles
Ophryotrocha diadema's adult musculature displays several
features that have been described previously for many
polychaete families, reviewed in [33]. The presence of one
prominent pair of ventral longitudinal muscles plus a
smaller longitudinal muscle situated just dorsally of the
ventral nerve cord is common in investigated polychaete
species. Conversely, the number and size of dorsal longitudinal muscles is more variable among taxa. In O. diadema, the dorsal longitudinal muscles comprise two
dorsolateral bands separated by a considerable dorsomedian gap. The innermost fibers of each dorsal longitudinal
muscle (DLM) repeatedly cross over each other at the dorsal midline along the anterioposterior axis, forming a regular pattern of intersecting dorsal longitudinal muscles
distinct from the dorsal diagonal muscles (Fig. 1A, DLM,

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/1

dm). To our knowledge, this muscle pattern has not yet
been described in any other polychaete species, although
it does appear in other members of the genus, such as
Ophryotrocha labronica (J. Brubacher, unpublished observations).
These dorsal and ventral longitudinal muscles, together
with a muscle ring surrounding the mouth opening, are
the first muscles to differentiate during embryogenesis of
O. diadema. Their formation starts within the peristomium, adjacent to the stomodeum. They gradually elongate towards the posterior by the addition of muscle fibers
at their posterior end – a posterior growth zone. During
this process, the longitudinal muscle strands do not display any sign of a repetitive pattern with respect to the
body-segments.
Early events in the formation of longitudinal muscles
have been also described in the polychaete Capitella sp. I
[45]. Like O. diadema, Capitella sp. I lacks a free-living trochophore larva [40,46,47]. The onset of muscle formation
in this species is characterized by the appearance of one
pair of ventrolateral and four dorsal longitudinal muscles,
which, as in O. diadema, elongate at their posterior ends.
In Capitella, additional (secondary) longitudinal muscles
are added after differentiation of these primary longitudinal muscles, forming an almost complete longitudinal
muscle layer.
Although adult oligochaetes possess a homogeneous
inner layer of longitudinal muscles, without distinct muscle bands [34,37] the formation of longitudinal muscles
in oligochaetes parallels the patterns described above in
important ways [6,7]. For example, myogenesis in
Enchytraeus coronatus (Enchytraeidae) and Limnodrilus sp.
(Tubificidae) begins with the formation of dorsal and
ventral bilateral pairs of primary longitudinal muscles
[6,7]. The ventral muscles arise adjacent to the developing
ventral nerve cord – the same position occupied by the
ventral longitudinal muscle bands in polychaetes [33]. As
in O. diadema and Capitella sp. I, longitudinal muscles in
these oligochaetes elongate from a posterior growth zone.
During a second step in muscle differentiation, additional
longitudinal muscle fiber strands are added dorsally and
laterally (and ventrally in Limnodrilus sp.), completing the
longitudinal muscle layer. The secondary longitudinal
strands are always formed adjacent to an already-present
primary or secondary longitudinal muscle and display the
same mode of elongation towards posterior as described
for the primary longitudinal muscles. By the end of
embryogenesis, the initial primary muscles strands cannot
be distinguished from the secondarily formed ones. This
second step in development of the longitudinal muscle
layer resembles the events during late myogenesis in
Capitella sp. I, which possesses an oligochaete-like near-

homogenous layer of longitudinal muscles [45]. This
stage of secondary muscle formation is missing in O. diadema. Here, the initial ventral muscles retain their status as
distinct muscle strands, and remain completely separated.
The medially crossing strands of the dorsal longitudinal
muscles (DLM, Fig. 1A) reflect a modification of the primary muscle growth pattern. However, we do not interpret this crossing as secondary muscle growth, as these
strands form by branching of the primary dorsal muscle
bands during their growth, rather than by formation of
new, distinct muscle strands after the primary musculature has been laid down, as in oligochaetes.
While the number of primary dorsal longitudinal muscles
varies among analyzed species (Capitella sp. I has four dorsal muscle strands, while O. diadema, E. coronatus, and
Limnodrilus sp. each have only two) the presence of a pair
of primary ventral longitudinal strands seems to be a common pattern among polychaetes and oligochaetes, irrespective of the adult musculature [34].
While the process of longitudinal muscle formation is
similar in polychaetes and oligochaetes, leeches
(Hirudinea), however, have their own characteristic pattern of embryonic muscle development. During myogenesis
in
the
hirudinean
Erpobdella
octoculata
(Erpobdellidae) no distinct primary longitudinal muscle
bands are formed [6]. In this case, primary longitudinal
muscles consist of thick bundles that branch at both ends.
These primary muscles are scattered over the flanks of the
embryo in an irregular manner, rather than in a stereotypical pattern of a set number of dorsal and ventral bands.
Later, secondary longitudinal muscle strands emerge and
grow in a gradual ventral-to-dorsal and anterior-to-posterior progression. The primary muscles are incorporated
into the expanding lattice of secondary muscles to form
the longitudinal muscle layer thereby. However, leeches
deviate morphologically from other annelid groups in
many ways, and are considered to represent a derived
annelid taxon [35,48-51]. Therefore, the differences in
their muscle formation relative to oligochaetes and polychaetes may also be a derived feature of this group [6].
Another feature of the ventral longitudinal muscles shared
by polychaetes and oligochaetes is their major contribution to the musculature of the prostomium, which has
been documented in a variety of annelid taxa. In the polychaetes Nerilla antennata, Nerillidium sp. and Trochonerilla
mobilis (Nerillidae), the ventral longitudinal muscles
extend into the prostomium, where they project into the
median antennae [32]. For some polychaetes – i.e.,
Magelona cf. mirabilis (Magelonidae) and Prionospio cirrifera (Spionidae) – these ventral muscles are the only longitudinal strands that contribute to the prostomial
musculature [30]. In E. coronatus and Limnodrilus sp. the

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/1

ventral longitudinal muscles also elongate into the prostomium, where they each branch into two strands, and
surround the anterior pole in a simple loop [6,7].
The dorsal longitudinal strands generally play a lesser part
in the prostomial musculature, stretching straight anteriorly if they extend into the prostomium at all. During
myogenesis in E. coronatus and Limnodrilus sp., the longitudinal muscles only grow into the prostomium after they
are well-established within the trunk [6,7]. In O. diadema,
the ventral muscles form three small projections that lie
anterior to the mouth opening. They are the anlage of the
diagonally running ventral prostomial muscles (dVLM),
which expand towards the anterior pole during embryogenesis (Fig 6C), and persist after hatching (Fig 2C). The
straight ventral prostomial muscles (sVLM) form later
during embryogenesis. At first, these remain in a lateral
position, but later develop anterior connections to the
diagonally running ventral prostomial muscles (dVLMs)
(Fig 7A,B).
The early state of prostomial muscle arrangement
observed here for O. diadema is very similar to the one
described for the adult muscle pattern in Dorvillea kastjani
(Dorvilleidae, Polychaeta) [31]. In this species the three
projections of the diagonal ventral longitudinal muscles
(dVLM) (named by Filippova et al. pr/cr: prostomial cross
and pr/r: prostomial rostral) are well developed but have
no obvious anterior connection to the straight ventral longitudinal muscles (sVLM) (called pr/l: prostomium longitudinal by Filippova et al). In post-hatch O. diadema,
however, the prostomial musculature continues to
develop, such that the anterior connections between the
dVLMs and sVLMs strengthen, and merge with the outer
dorsal longitudinal muscle (oDLM) to form an anterior
muscle cap. Development of the medial projection of the
diagonal ventral longitudinal muscle (dVLM) is difficult
to follow but it likely becomes the ventrally situated elongation of the dVLM depicted in Figure 2C (circle).
Our findings, combined with previous studies, suggest
that a bilateral pair of ventral longitudinal muscles contributing to the prostomial musculature is a common feature in polychaetes and oligochaetes. The precise number
of dorsal longitudinal strands included in this general
muscle arrangement has yet to be determined; however
two dorsal muscles seem to represent the most common
pattern [34].
Parapodial muscles
The majority of the body musculature, aside from the longitudinal muscles, is contained within the parapodial
muscle complexes. The parapodial muscles in O. diadema
are almost identical to those described for Dorvillea kastjani (Dorvilleidae) [31]. Interestingly, several investiga-

tions of polychaete parapodial muscles indicate that
parapodial muscles of greatest complexity are found in
species that do not use their appendages for locomotion
[33,52]. In these species, the parapodia bear dorsally
directed chaetae and likely function as defensive equipment. O. diadema, on the other hand, uses its uniramous,
unornamented parapodia for locomotion in a walkinglike manner, consistent with the relatively simple parapodial musculature described here. The four anteriormost
parapodia are formed during embryogenesis in an anterior-to-posterior sequence, before the worm hatches from
its egg case. After hatching, additional parapodia-bearing
body segments are added through the activity of a proliferative zone just anterior to the pygidium, as in other
annelids [53,54]. Although O. diadema lacks a trochophore larva, the timing of myogenic events in the trunk
and parapodia during development resemble that of indirectly developing polychaetes with a free-living trochophore larva. These polychaetes, such as Platynereis
dumerilii (Nereididae) and Pomatoceros lamarckii (Serpulidae), exhibit an early development of synchronously
formed three bilateral pairs of parapodia, defining the
metatrochophoral state [3,43]. Initially, both of these species have three parapodial segments. P. lamarckii undergoes metamorphosis to a sessile lifestyle, retaining the
musculature of the larval parapods, whereas P. dumerilii,
adapting the benthic lifestyle of the adult, grows by segment proliferation. Conversely, the temporal pattern in
parapodial muscle differentiation is quite different in
Capitella sp. I [45,46,55]. Chaetal, oblique and intrasegmental muscles are added during metamorphosis, after
embryogenesis and the formation of the circular and longitudinal muscles of the body. This kind of change in the
relative timing of developmental events in related taxa
(heterochrony) is widely held to be an important mechanism underlying morphological change during evolution
[43,56].
The earliest signs of parapodia in O. diadema are the chaetae, which lie just below the body-wall, roughly marking
the middle of each body-segment. The first muscles of the
parapodial complex to appear are the posterior parapodial muscles (pPM). These muscles occupy the same position as the transverse muscles (tm) anterior and posterior
to the ciliary bands described for earlier stages Fig. 5E,H).
Transverse muscles can easily be mistaken for true circular
muscles at first glance. But since they lie below the longitudinal muscles, they do not possess the characteristic
supralongitudinal position of true circular fibers, which
always lie just below the epidermis (Fig. 6B). So it is possible that these transverse muscles are the anlage of the
posterior parapodial muscles (pma). It might also be that
the parapodial muscles cover the transverse muscles during their enhanced development. But this seems rather
unlikely, because the close inspection of the adult parapo-

http://www.frontiersinzoology.com/content/5/1/1

dial muscle complex through 3D reconstruction did not
reveal any other transverse muscles at this position, aside
from inner and outer posterior parapodial muscles. The
only other transverse muscles found on the ventral side
are situated within the anterior halves of the body segment, without any connection to the posteriorly situated
ciliary bands.
Chaetal and acicular muscles begin to appear only after
the outer parapodial muscles started to form. Both the
chaetal (chm) and acicular muscles (am) differentiate in
direct contact with the chaetal types they support. It seems
that the chaetae move into the distal portion of the growing parapodia and the aciculae migrate towards the midline, as their associated muscles lengthen (am and chm).
Circular muscles
The segmentally arranged parapodial muscle anlagen
(pma) that run in a transverse manner in close proximity
to the ciliary bands do not represent true circular muscles,
due to their position below of the longitudinal muscles.
There are numerous transverse muscles present at the dorsal side of O. diadema. Some of these muscles belong to
the parapodial muscle complex (adPM, pdPM) and lie
below the dorsal longitudinal muscles. However, there are
also transverse muscles in a supralongitudinal position,
which could be clearly identified in histological sections
(Fig. 1E). These fibers are only weakly developed, and we
could not determine whether they form complete circles
surrounding the whole body of O. diadema. Complete circular muscles must be rare, if present at all, as only a few
ventral transverse muscles could be found, whereas there
are plentiful transverse muscles present dorsally and laterally. This discrepancy implies that many incomplete circular muscles exist, spanning the dorsal side but terminating
at the laterally in chaetigerous segments. Such a patterns
corresponds with the findings in Dorvillea kastjani, where
true circular fibers were only present in the intersegmental
furrows [31]. Interestingly, several complete rings of transverse muscles exist in the zone of segment proliferation,
just anterior to the pygidium, in juvenile O. diadema (Fig.
1A and 8D), some of which are true circular muscles (i.e.,
external to the longitudinal muscles). This pattern resembles that described for regenerating fragments in Dorvillea
bermudensis [34]. In D. bermudensis, closed circles of transverse fibers are established initially in the regenerating
region, but are later disrupted by formation of parapodia.
This pattern observed in regenerating specimens may
therefore represent a juvenile character.

Conclusion
Recent studies of polychaetes have revealed a great variety
of adult muscle patterns, unlike the closed, homogeneous
muscle layers present in oligochaete taxa. These obviously
different arrangements have considerably hampered

attempts to directly correlate the musculatures of these
groups with each other, in the ongoing discussion concerning the ground pattern of annelids. However, developmental data from various annelid taxa has revealed
common characters evident during myogenesis in these
species. Here, we have shown that Ophryotrocha diadema
shares with the oligochaetes Enchytraeus coronatus and
Limnodrilus sp. distinct ventral longitudinal muscle bands
that are almost identically established during ontogenesis.
We consider it very likely that these muscular structures
are homologous, and that the primary formation of a
bilateral pair of ventral longitudinal muscles is an ancestral character of annelids.
Unfortunately, due to the lack of a reliable annelid phylogeny, we can only speculate about the direction of evolutionary change in annelid musculature. Taking the
presence of a bilateral pair of ventral longitudinal muscles
in early development as an ancestral character, it follows
that the oligochaete-like musculature and embryonic formation of secondary longitudinal muscles is either an
evolutionary novelty (and therefore derived) or a character that has been lost in polychaetes. In the latter case, the
loss of secondary muscle formation in polychaetes would
be the derived condition.

Methods
Worm culture
Cultures of Ophryotrocha diadema (a gift from Bertil Åkesson, Göteborg University) were maintained in glass dishes
at room temperature, in artificial sea water (Crystal Sea
Marinemix, Marine Enterprises Intl., Baltimore, MD) with
a specific gravity of 1.021 g·ml-1. Each week, half the seawater in the dishes was refreshed, and worms were fed
spinach finely chopped with a Waring blender.
Fixation
Unless otherwise noted, all chemicals used in fixation
were from Sigma, Oakville, Canada. O. diadema brood
their embryos in transparent, gelatinous tubes. Worm
embryos and larvae were removed from brood tubes using
0.1 mm minuten pins mounted on applicator sticks. We
fixed them in seawater + 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde
(Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA), for either 3
h at room temperature, or overnight at 4°C. Larvae
mature enough to show evidence of muscle activity were
anaesthetized for 10 min in a 1:1 mixture of seawater and
370 mM MgCl2 prior to fixation. After fixation, we washed
worms several times in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4
(PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.4
mM KH2PO4) plus 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 (PBT). Prior to
use, worms were stored at 4°C in PBT + 0.05% (w/v)
sodium azide.

3D modeling of musculature from serially sectioned,
epoxy-embedded material
For histological analysis, worms were anaesthetized in a
mixture of equal parts sea water and 370 mM MgCl2, then
fixed for 2 days at 4°C in 3% (w/v) glutaraldehyde + 0.5%
(w/v) paraformaldehyde, in a buffer containing 100 mM
PIPES, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4, and 200 mM sucrose,
pH 6.9. After primary fixation, worms were washed in 0.1
M sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2, then further fixed for 90
min in 1% (w/v) OsO4 in washing buffer, on ice. Specimens were dehydrated through graded ethanol into acetone, and embedded in a 4:5:12 mixture of Araldite 502,
EMbed 812 and dodecenyl succinic anhydride, catalyzed
with 1.5% (v/v) DMP-30. (Fixatives and resin components from Electron Microscopy Sciences, buffering agents
and salts from Sigma).

Serial 1 µm transverse sections were cut from tissue blocks
on a Porter-Blum MT-2B ultramicrotome, and stained
with a mixture of methylene blue and azure B, followed
by basic fuchsine [57]. Grayscale images of sections illuminated with red, green and blue light were captured and
merged to generate color images, using an AxioImager Z.1
microscope equipped with an AxioCam MRm camera and
AxioVision 4.6 software (Zeiss). To align images, trace features of interest, and construct 3D models from serial sections, we used IMOD software, v. 3.5.3 [58].
Immunostaining
For immunostaining, a protocol previously described for
Enchytraeus japanoensis was adapted [59]. Incubation
times within the described buffers were reduced to two to
three hours each, depending on embryonic stage of the
specimens. A monoclonal anti-acetylated tubulin antibody (Sigma, T-6793) was used at 1:500 dilution in 1 ×
PBS (140 mM NaCl, 6.5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM Na2HPO4, 1.5
mM KH2PO4, pH 7.5) at 4°C for 12 to 48 hours. After several washes in PBT (PBS + 0,1% (v/v) Tween-20), the secondary antibody (anti-mouse Cy2 conjugated; Dianova,
Hamburg, Germany) was applied diluted 1:150 in PBS for
12 to 48 hours at 4°C. Unbound antibody was removed
by several washes with PBT.
Phalloidin staining
After immunostaining, the embryos were transferred into
a freshly made solution of TRITC-conjugated phalloidin
(Sigma, P1951) prepared by evaporating 5 µl of a stock
solution (3.3 µM in ethanol) and reconstituting in 250 µl
of PBS. Embryos were stained in this solution for 1–3 h,
in the dark. The phalloidin solution was then removed
and the embryos were washed several times with PBT.
Nuclear staining
We used Draq5™ (Alexis Biochemicals, Germany) to label
nuclei. After immuno – and phalloidin staining of O. dia-

dema embryos, this dye solution was applied at a 1:500
dilution in PBS. After incubation for 30 minutes in the
dark, the dye was removed, the embryos were washed several times in PBT, and mounted in Fluoromount-G
(Southern Biotech, USA) before microscopic inspection.

cLSM and 3D-Reconstruction
All fluorescence pictures were captured with a Pascal 5
Laser Scanning Microscope (Zeiss, Germany) using a HeNe laser for TRITC and Draq5™ (543 nm and 633 nm,
respectively) and an argon laser (488 nm) for Cy2 documentation. When multi-colored picture stacks were taken,
the same plane thickness and distance were used for all
staining conjugates to minimize optical shift. Digital pictures were edited with Adobe PhotoShop (San Jose, CA,
USA) to adjust brightness and contrast. The same software
was used to combine projections to generate complete
montages of large embryos.

3D-reconstructions were carried out using amira™ 3.0
(Mercury Computer Systems, USA) using the label-field
tool to individually label single muscles in each cLSM produced picture stack. 3D-Figures were obtained with the
surface-generating algorithm of the software.
