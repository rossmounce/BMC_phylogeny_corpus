Abstract
Background: Diarrhea is the third leading infectious cause of death worldwide and is estimated
to be responsible for approximately 2 million deaths a year. While many infectious causes of
diarrhea have been established, approximately 40% of all diarrhea cases are of unknown etiology.
In an effort to identify novel viruses that may be causal agents of diarrhea, we used high throughput
mass sequencing to analyze stool samples collected from patients with acute diarrhea.
Results: Sequences with limited similarity to known picornaviruses were detected in a stool
sample collected in Australia from a child with acute diarrhea. Using a combination of mass
sequencing, RT-PCR, 5' RACE and 3' RACE, a 6383 bp fragment of the viral genome was sequenced.
Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this virus was highly divergent from, but most closely
related to, members of the genus Kobuvirus. We have tentatively named this novel virus klassevirus
1. We also detected klassevirus 1 by RT-PCR in a diarrhea specimen collected from a patient in St.
Louis, United States as well as in untreated sewage collected in Barcelona, Spain.
Conclusion: Klassevirus 1 is a previously undescribed picornavirus that is globally widespread and
present on at least three continents. Further investigations to determine whether klassevirus 1 is
a human pathogen are needed.

Background
The impact of diarrhea is primarily felt in the developing
world, where approximately 2 million deaths result from
diarrhea annually [1-3]. In developed countries, where
diarrhea related mortality is relatively rare, there is still
nonetheless a tremendous disease burden. For example,

in the United States, approximately 9% of all hospitalizations for children under age 5 years are due to diarrhea
episodes [4]. While rotaviruses, caliciviruses, adenoviruses, and astroviruses are responsible for the greatest proportion of cases [5-8], approximately 40% of diarrhea
cases are of unknown etiology [9-11].

Many picornaviruses can be detected in human stool such
as enteroviruses, polio, Aichi virus, and cardioviruses [1215]. Some of these viruses, such as Aichi virus, are associated with diarrheal disease [13] while others such as polio
are shed fecally, but manifest pathogenicity in other organ
systems. Picornaviruses are non-enveloped viruses with a
single stranded positive-sense RNA genome that encodes
a single polyprotein [12]. The picornavirus family currently consists of 14 proposed genera http://www.picor
naviridae.com associated with a diverse range of diseases.
Viruses in six of these genera potentially infect humans
(Enterovirus, Hepatovirus, Parechovirus, Kobuvirus, Cosavirus,
and Cardiovirus). With the advent of culture independent
molecular methods, many diverse new members of the
picornavirus family have been identified in recent years.
These include novel cardioviruses [14-17], rhinoviruses
[18-20], parechoviruses [21,22] and the novel genus of
cosaviruses [23,24]. These studies have demonstrated that
significant viral diversity exists in the human gut that
remains unexplored.
We have previously described a mass sequencing strategy
based on high throughput Sanger sequencing to analyze
human stool for previously undescribed viruses [25]. In
this study, we used a similar strategy but incorporated a
next-generation pyrosequencing platform (Roche
Genome Sequencer) in place of traditional Sanger
sequencing. This resulted in the identification of a highly
divergent picornavirus in a stool sample collected in 1984
from a child in Australia with acute diarrhea. Sequencing
and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that this virus is
a novel member of the family Picornaviridae. We propose
that this virus be named klassevirus 1 (kobu-like virus
associated with stool and sewage).

Results
Identification and sequencing of klassevirus 1
Extracted nucleic acid from a stool specimen collected in
1984 from a child with acute diarrhea was subjected to
high throughput mass sequencing using 454 pyroseqencing technology. From the resulting reads, two sequences
were identified by BLAST that had only limited sequence
identity to known viruses. One was a 217 bp fragment
that upon translation to amino acid sequence had 42%
identity to its closest relative, Aichi virus (2B/2C region).
The second sequence read of 443 bp had 40% amino acid
identity to the VP0 region of Aichi virus. From these two
initial sequences, a 6383 bp contig (klasse-mel1) was generated by RT-PCR and multiple 3' and 5' random amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) reactions. The 5' end of this
contig aligned to the predicted VP0 protein at the N-terminus of the polyprotein and extended past the predicted 3D
protein at the C-terminus of the polyprotein to the poly-A
tail. The initial assembly was confirmed by sequencing
multiple overlapping RT-products spanning the length of

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/86

the contig to give 3.3X coverage. We were not able to
extend the contig further in the 5' direction despite performing multiple 5' RACE reactions using different primers with multiple high temperature (70°C) reverse
transcriptases (rTth [Applied Biosystems] and Thermoscript [Invitrogen]).
The klassevirus 1 contig had a genomic organization similar to other picornaviruses (Figure 1A–C). Conserved
Pfam [26] motifs characteristic of picornaviruses were
present including two picornavirus capsid proteins, RNA
helicase, 3C cysteine protease, and RNA dependent RNA
polymerase.
Phylogenetic analysis of klassevirus 1
Phylogenetic analysis of the VP3/VP1, P2, and P3 regions
of the genome demonstrated that this virus sequence is
highly divergent from all previously described picornaviruses (Figure 2A–C). The closest relatives of klassevirus 1
appeared to be members of the genus Kobuvirus, which
includes Aichi virus, bovine kobuvirus and porcine kobuvirus.
Epidemiological survey for klassevirus 1
In order to determine the prevalence of klassevirus 1, two
patient cohorts were examined by RT-PCR. In the first
cohort, 340 pediatric stool specimens sent to the clinical
microbiology lab for bacterial culture at the St. Louis Children's Hospital in St. Louis MO, USA were tested. One
sample from this cohort was positive by RT-PCR. The
amplicon from this patient's virus (designated klasse-stl1)
was found to have 92% identity at the amino acid level
and 88% nucleotide identity to the original klasse-mel1
contig. Screening of 143 stool samples from children with
acute diarrhea collected from the Royal Children's Hospital (Melbourne, Australia) did not yield any additional
positive samples. In addition, RT-PCR was performed on
concentrated raw sewage collected in Barcelona, Spain. A
PCR product of the expected size was obtained and

directly sequenced. This fragment (klasse-bar1) shared
85% amino acid identity and 84% nucleotide identity to
the original klasse-mel1 sequence (Table 1).
To further compare the divergence between the three positive samples of klassevirus 1, RT-PCR was performed
using primers that target the polymerase region (3D) of
the genome and the VP0/VP3 region. Approximately one
kb of additional sequence was generated from klasse-bar1
and klasse-stl1 in both of these regions (see methods).
Pair-wise amino acid identities ranged from 85%–97%,
with the greatest degree of sequence conservation in the
3D region (Table 1).

Discussion
In this study, we identified a previously undescribed
picornavirus present in stool and sewage. Phylogenetic
analysis demonstrated that this virus is most closely
related to other picornaviruses in the genus Kobuvirus.
Based on the criteria established by the picornavirus study
group, members of a genus should share > 40%, > 40%
and > 50% amino acid identity in P1, P2 and P3 genome
regions respectively [27]. Klassevirus 1 shared only 43%
amino acid identity in the P3 region and 33% amino acid
identity in the P2 region to its closest relative, Aichi virus.
Given these observations, and using strictly the percent
identity definitions, klassevirus 1 may represent the first
member of new picornavirus genus. However, we note
that at all loci, bootstrap analysis suggests that klassevirus
1 diverged from an ancestor common to all of the known
kobuviruses. Thus the formal classification of klassevirus
1 at the genus level is currently uncertain and subject to
further discussion per the ICTV.

Whether klassevirus 1 represents a true human pathogen
remains to be determined. It is possible that klassevirus 1
is a human pathogen that causes gastroenteritis. It is also
possible that klassevirus 1 injures other organs but is
excreted through the intestinal tract like poliovirus.
Another possibility is that klassevirus 1 is a human commensal virus. Alternatively, klassevirus 1 could represent a
non-human virus acquired from dietary exposure. Further
investigations are needed to determine if klassevirus 1 is a
causal agent of human disease(s). To begin addressing
this question, epidemiologic studies including case-control and seroprevalence analyses are needed.

Subsequent screening by RT-PCR using primers targeting
the 2C region of the genome established that klassevirus
1-like sequences were present not only in Australia, but
also in North America and Europe. The presence of klassevirus 1 in the United States was determined by the traditional strategy of screening of individual stool samples. In
addition, we also examined raw sewage collected in Barcelona to see if we could detect klassevirus 1. Sewage represents a pooled meta-sample of literally thousands of
individual specimens. Known enteric viruses such as adenoviruses [28,29], noroviruses [30] astroviruses [31], and
hepatitis A [32] have frequently been tested for and
detected in sewage by PCR and RT-PCR. We reasoned that
detection of klassevirus 1 in raw sewage would serve as a
proxy for its presence in human stool in the population
that generated the sewage. Since the exact history of the
sewage is poorly defined, it is possible that other waste
products, such as animal feces could contribute to the raw
sewage meta-genome. Nonetheless, we propose that raw
sewage screening from a diversity of sites can serve to rapidly define the geographic distribution of a given virus.
The detection of klassevirus 1 in stool and sewage from
Melbourne, Barcelona and St. Louis, demonstrates that
klassevirus 1 is globally distributed. Moreover, since both
the Barcelona sewage and St. Louis stool specimens were
collected in 2008, we conclude that klassevirus 1 is currently circulating in the human population.

Primary Stool Specimen
This stool was collected in 1984 from a 38 month old
child presenting to the emergency department of the
Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia with
acute diarrhea and stored at -80°C. Previous testing of this
diarrhea specimen for known enteric pathogens using
routine enzyme immunoassays (EIA) and culture assays
for rotaviruses, adenoviruses, and common bacterial and
parasitic pathogens was negative [6]. Additionally, RTPCR assays for caliciviruses and astroviruses were also
negative [6,33].

Sample preparation for 454 sequencing
120 mg of frozen stool was chipped and then resuspended
in 6 volumes of PBS [25]. The sample was centrifuged to
pellet particulate matter and the supernatant was then
passed through a 0.45 μm filter. Total nucleic acid was isolated from 100 μL primary stool filtrate using QiAmp
DNA extraction kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's
instructions. Total nucleic acid was randomly amplified
using the Round AB protocol as previously described [34].
This was then pyrosequenced on a Roche FLX Genome
sequencer (Roche) according to manufacturer's protocol.
To eliminate sequence redundancy in each library
sequences were clustered using BLASTCLUST from the
2.2.17 version of NCBI BLAST. Sequences were clustered
based on 98% identity over 98% sequence length and the
longest sequence from each cluster was chosen as the representative sequence of the cluster. Unique sequences
were filtered for repetitive sequences and then compared
with the GenBank nr database by BLASTN and TBLASTX.
Sequencing of klassevirus 1
For sequencing experiments, the stool filtrate was proteinase K treated prior to RNA extraction. RNA was isolated
from primary stool filtrate using RNA-Bee (Tel-Test, Inc.)
according to manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR and
3'RACE reactions were performed using SuperScript III
and Platinum Taq (Invitrogen One-Step RT-PCR). For
5'RACE reactions cDNA was generated with Themoscript
(Invitrogen) and amplified with Accuprime Taq (Invitrogen). Amplicons were either cloned into pCR4 (Invitrogen) or sequenced directly.
Phylogenetic Analysis
Protein sequences associated with the following reference
virus genomes were obtained from GenBank: Equine
Rhinitis A virus (NP_653075.1), Foot-and-mouth-type-O
(NP_658990.1), Equine Rhinitis B virus (NP_653077.1),

(NP_740257.1), Porcine kobuvirus (YP_002456506.1),
Human coxsackievirus A2 (AAR38840.1), Porcine enterovirus A (NC_003987), Human poliovirus 2 (M12197),
Avian encephalomyelitis virus (NC_003990), Duck hepatitis virus 1 (ABI23434), Seal picornavirus type 1
(NC_009891), Human Cosavirus A1 (FJ438902), and
Human parechovirus 1 (AAA72291.1). Multiple sequence
alignments were performed using ClustalX (1.83). The
amino acid alignments generated by ClustalX were input
into PAUP [35], and maximum parsimony analysis was
performed using the default settings with 1,000 replicates.

Epidemiological survey for klassevirus 1
Melbourne Cohort
Stool samples were collected from children under the age
of 5 who were admitted to the Royal Children's Hospital,
Melbourne, Victoria, Australia with acute diarrhea
between 1978 and 1999. For a portion of these samples
(70), RNA was extracted in the same manner as the primary sample. For the remaining specimens (73), chips of
frozen fecal specimens (~30–150 mg) were resuspended
in 6 volumes of PBS. Total nucleic acid was extracted from
200 μL of each stool suspension using a MagnaPure LC
instrument (Roche). 200 μL of water was used to elute the
total nucleic acid from each sample.
St. Louis Cohort
Leftover material from 340 stool specimens that were routinely submitted to the St. Louis Children's Hospital Lab
for bacterial culture were collected from January 2008–
July 2008. For these specimens total nucleic acid was
extracted as described above. This study was approved by
the Human Research Protection Office of Washington
University.
Raw sewage
One 10 L-sample of raw sewage was collected in an urban
wastewater treatment plant in the area of Barcelona,
Spain. The sample was collected in a sterile container and
stored for up to 2 hours at 4°C before being processed.
The viruses present in the sample were concentrated in 30
mL of phosphate buffer by organic flocculation based on
the procedure previously described by Calgua et al., 2008
[36]. A second concentration step with elution of the viral
particles was performed. Briefly, 10 mL of the viral concentrate were eluted with 40 mL of 0.25 M glycine buffer
(pH 9,5) at 4°C, suspended solids were separated by low
speed centrifugation at 7500 × g for 30 min at 4°C and the
viruses present in the supernatant were finally concentrated in 1 mL of PBS by ultracentrifugation at 87500 × g
for 1 h at 4°C. This was then DNase treated, and then total
nucleic acid was extracted.
RT-PCR for detection of klassevirus 1
Primers expected to generate a 345 bp product were
designed to the 2C region of klassevirus 1 (LG0098: 5'CGTCAGGGTGTTCGTGATTA-3' and LG0093: 5'-AGAGAGAGCTGTGGAGTAATTAGTA-3'). RT-PCR reactions were
performed using Qiagen one-step kit under the following
conditions: 30 min RT step, 94°C hold for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 56°C for 30 s, and
72°C for 60 s. In order to further compare strain divergence, primers expected to produce amplicons of 1001 bp
and 1025 bp based on the klasse-mel1 sequence were
designed targeting the 3D and VP0/VP3 regions, respectively: (LG0118: 5'-ATGGCAACCCTGTCCCTGAG-3' and
LG0117
5'-GGAAACCCAACCACGCTGTA-3')
and

(LG0119:
5'-GCTAACTCTAATGCTGCCACC-3'
and
LG0136: 5'-GCTAGGTCAGTGGAAGGATCA-3'). These
RT-PCR reactions were performed using the Invitrogen
One-Step RT-PCR kit with the following conditions: 30
min RT step at 60°C, 94°C hold for 2 min, followed by 40
cycles of 94°C for 15 s, 56°C for 30 s, 68°C for 90 s.
Whenever possible, amplicons were cloned into pCR4
(Invitrogen) and sequenced using standard Sanger
sequencing technology. In some instances, PCR products
were directly sequenced and only high quality sequence
from those samples were included in analysis. All klassevirus 1 sequences have been deposited in Genbank
(GQ253930-GQ253936).
