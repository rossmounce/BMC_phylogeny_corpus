Abstract
Background: Lysozymes are important model enzymes in biomedical research with a ubiquitous
taxonomic distribution ranging from phages up to plants and animals. Their main function appears
to be defence against pathogens, although some of them have also been implicated in digestion.
Whereas most organisms have only few lysozyme genes, nematodes of the genus Caenorhabditis
possess a surprisingly large repertoire of up to 15 genes.
Results: We used phylogenetic inference and sequence analysis tools to assess the evolution of
lysozymes from three congeneric nematode species, Caenorhabditis elegans, C. briggsae, and C.
remanei. Their lysozymes fall into three distinct clades, one belonging to the invertebrate-type and
the other two to the protist-type lysozymes. Their diversification is characterised by (i) ancestral
gene duplications preceding species separation followed by maintenance of genes, (ii) ancestral
duplications followed by gene loss in some of the species, and (iii) recent duplications after
divergence of species. Both ancestral and recent gene duplications are associated in several cases
with signatures of adaptive sequence evolution, indicating that diversifying selection contributed to
lysozyme differentiation. Current data strongly suggests that genetic diversity translates into
functional diversity.
Conclusion: Gene duplications are a major source of evolutionary innovation. Our analysis
provides an evolutionary framework for understanding the diversification of lysozymes through
gene duplication and subsequent differentiation. This information is expected to be of major value
in future analysis of lysozyme function and in studies of the dynamics of evolution by gene
duplication.

Background
Since their discovery by Ian Fleming, lysozymes have
become an important model system in molecular biology,
biochemistry, and structural biology with major biomedical importance [1]. They are ubiquitous enzymes known
from almost all groups of organisms including phages,
bacteria, protists, fungi, animals, and plants [2-7]. Several

distinct lysozyme types are recognised, including the
chicken-type, goose-type, invertebrate-type, or amoeba
lysozymes [2,7,8]. Because of their ability to break up peptidoglycan (an important component of bacterial cell
walls) and their induced expression upon pathogen exposure, their original function was suggested to be defence
against bacterial infections. At the same time, some lysPage 1 of 19

ozymes are involved in digestion. This function is found
in vertebrate and insect taxa, which obtain nutrition from
microorganisms involved in decomposing organic matter,
e.g. the vertebrate foregut fermenters like ruminant artiodactyls, leaf-eating monkeys, the bird hoatzin, and the
Drosophila and Musca flies [5,9-11].
Lysozymes have additionally become an important model
in studies of molecular evolution. The origin of a digestive
function in the leaf-eating monkeys was found to show
the characteristic signature of adaptive sequence evolution, i.e. the non-synonymous substitution rate was significantly larger than the synonymous substitution rate,
strongly indicating that amino acid-changing mutations
were favoured by natural selection [12,13]. Gene duplication appears to play an important role in lysozyme evolution. Impressive examples include the ruminant
artiodactyls with at least seven genes per genome [10],
Drosophila fruitlies with at least eleven loci [5,14], and the
mosquito Anopheles gambiae with at least nine lysozymes
[15]. In these examples, some lysozymes have a digestive
function. Functional diversification is further indicated by
variation in gene expression pattern (e.g., timing, tissue,
expression level) and several biochemical characteristics.
For instance, the digestive lysozymes differ from the antimicrobial lysozymes by an increased expression in the
gut, their resistance to protease degradation, an acidic isoelectric point and pH optimum [5,9]. Taken together,
these patterns are consistent with the specific role of gene
duplication as a source of evolutionary innovation [16],
as known for diverse gene families like the animal hox
and the vertebrate MHC genes [17,18].
An unexpected diversity of lysozymes is found in nematodes of the genus Caenorhabditis. They contain up to 15
different lysozymes of two distinct types [19,20]: the
invertebrate-type and another distinct type that is charac-

terized by lysozymes from various protist taxa (hereafter
termed protist-type lysozymes). Although the exact function of these enzymes has not as yet been assessed systematically, some of them are involved in pathogen defence
[19-21]. In the current paper, we provide a framework for
understanding diversification of the Caenorhabditis lysozymes. In particular, we explore the lysozyme genealogy
and test the hypothesis that gene duplications associate
with diversifying selection, as expected for a role in immunity against the usually rapidly evolving repertoire of
pathogens. Lysozyme sequences are considered from the
three Caenorhabditis species with completely sequenced
genomes, i.e. C. elegans, C. briggsae, and C. remanei [22].
Their genealogies are reconstructed at both protein and
DNA sequence level with the help of maximum likelihood (ML) tree inference methods [23]. Signatures of positive selection are assessed across branches of the inferred
genealogy and across the aligned sequences with the help
of the maximum likelihood approach developed by
Ziheng Yang and co-workers [24,25]. The results are
related to the current data on lysozyme function.

Results
Overview and general phylogenetic position of the
Caenorhabditis lysozymes
The lysozymes from the three Caenorhabditis species are
listed in Table 1 and 2. The genomic distribution of clustered genes is illustrated in Fig. 1. As a first step, we compared all complete lysozyme protein sequences from C.
elegans with those from various vertebrates, invertebrates,
protists, and one phage. For this purpose, a multiple
sequence alignment was generated based on a hierarchical
method, i.e. similar sequences are aligned first, followed
by alignment of less similar sequences (see methods). We
noted that the resulting alignment almost exclusively contained variable positions. Moreover, if we varied the settings of the alignment algorithm (e.g. gap opening, gap

extension, or gap distance penalties), only few regions
could be recovered in identical form. Therefore, positional homology may not be entirely reliable. Since the
alignment was inferred from the hierarchical algorithm, it
should still be informative as to the general phylogenetic
position of the nematode lysozymes. In fact, its phylogenetic analysis highlighted that the nematode possesses
two distinct lysozyme types (Fig. 2; inferred from the
alignment obtained using default settings of the alignment programme), thus confirming previous observations. In particular, five C. elegans lysozymes group with
the invertebrate-type lysozymes. These lysozyme genes are
thus labelled Cel-ilys-1 up to Cel-ilys-5. The remaining ten
C. elegans lysozymes are the previously labelled genes lys1 up to lys-10. They fall into two separate lineages within
the distinct clade of protist lysozymes.
For the more detailed phylogenetic analyses, we examined
the two lysozyme types separately. For this purpose, we
generated two new alignments and several subsets of these
(see methods and below).
Evolution of invertebrate-type lysozymes
The genomes of C. briggsae and C. remanei contain two
and three invertebrate-type lysozyme genes, respectively.

They were named in consideration of their similarity and
phylogenetic affinity to the C. elegans lysozymes (see
below; Table 1). Three of the five invertebrate-type lysozymes from C. elegans are found in a single cluster and
with the same orientation on chromosome IV (Fig. 1A).
None of the other genes are present in clusters (Table 1).
All invertebrate-type lysozymes could be reliably aligned
to each other at both protein (alignment 2; Fig. 3) and
DNA sequence level (alignment 3; position of indels is
identical between the two alignments). Two genes show
unusual properties in comparison to the others and thus
they may be non-functional (i.e. they are pseudogenes).
In particular, the gene Cbr-ilys-4 possesses an unusual
amino terminus and it lacks a signal peptide. Cel-ilys-1
contains a large insertion, it shows many nucleotide differences to the other sequences, and it also lacks a signal
peptide.
Phylogenetic analysis of protein and DNA sequences
yielded essentially identical tree topologies (Fig. 4A). The
only two differences refer to (i) the exact position of Celilys-1, Cel-ilys-2, and Cel-ilys-3 in relation to each other,
and (ii) the position of Cel-ilys-4 and Cbr-ilys-4 in relation
to the monophylum of Cre-ilys-4.1 and Cre-ilys-4.2. These
discrepancies are reflected by low bootstrap support for

indicating lack of sufficient unambiguous phylogenetic
information in the sequences. Otherwise, the inferred
genealogy identifies two distinct clades, one with the ilys4 genes and the other with all remaining genes. Both
clades contain genes from all three taxa.
Our analysis did not reveal any indication for adaptive
sequence evolution across sequences (likelihood ratio test
[LRT] comparison between model M8 with either model
M7 or M8a, P â¥ 0.5). However, we consistently identified
two episodes of positive selection along the phylogeny,
regardless of the analysis method (Table 3; Fig. 4). In both
cases, adaptive sequence evolution associates with incidences of intra-lineage lysozyme radiations (in one case

within the C. remanei and the other case within the C. elegans lineage; Fig. 4A). Most of the remaining branches
have a dN/dS rate ratio well below 1, suggesting purifying
selection (i.e. amino acid changes are selectively disfavoured).
Evolution of protist-type lysozymes
The protist-type lysozymes are present with either seven
(both C. briggsae and C. remanei) or ten genes (C. elegans;
Table 2). Synteny is found for the genes lys-1, lys-2, and lys3, which are clustered in all three species â in both C. elegans and C. briggsae on chromosome V and in C. remanei
on supercontig 13 (Table 2; Fig. 1B). The gene lys-1 is
always found in opposite orientation to the other two. In
C. remanei, the lys-3 homologue is separated from the

(and four open-reading frames) in contrast to both C. elegans and C. briggsae, where the three genes are directly
adjacent to each other. In C. elegans, the lys-7 gene is additionally found on chromosome V, but in a different location than the three clustered genes (Fig. 1B). C. elegans
contains a second well-defined cluster of protist-type lysozymes on chromosome IV, including Cel-lys-4, Cel-lys-5,
and Cel-lys-6. In this case, there is no synteny in the other
species. Interestingly, however, the C. briggsae chromosome IV contains a cluster that combines genes from the
above C. elegans cluster (in this case the C. briggsae genes
Cbr-lys-6.1 and Cbr-lys-6.2) with the gene Cbr-lys-10. The
C. elegans orthologue of the latter gene, Cel-lys-10, is similarly present on chromosome IV but in a different location
than the cluster (Fig. 1A). In C. remanei, two additional
genes are found in relatively close physical proximity to
each other: Cre-lys-8.1 and Cre-lys-8.2 are located on

supercontig 9 (Table 2) separated by approximately
200,000 nucleotides and 56 open-reading frames.
The overall phylogeny of the protist-type lysozymes from
nematodes and one outgroup taxon (Dictyestelium discoideum) was assessed with an alignment of the complete
protein sequences (alignment 4; Fig. 5 and Additional file
1). This alignment was robust to variations of the settings
of the alignment programme. In contrast, for the corresponding DNA sequences, several regions could not be
recovered in identical form under similar variations.
Therefore, it cannot be entirely excluded that these regions
bear an increased risk of homoplasy. To reduce this risk
for the detailed analysis of lysozyme evolution (i.e. inference of non-synonymous and synonymous substitution
rates), we extracted five subsets from alignment 4. Of
these, alignment 5 consists of the alignable part of all protist-type lysozyme DNA sequences from the Caenorhabdi-

Branch names are as depicted in Fig. 4B. For the first comparison, dN/
dS rate ratios were inferred for individual branches with the free-ratio
model, in which all branches were allowed to vary; the optimal model
had a likelihood of ln L = -2871.29; the significance of individual
branches having a dN/dS rate ratios above 1 or below 1 was assessed
with non-parametric bootstrapping using 100 replicates; dN/dS rate
ratios larger than 1 and with bootstrap support of more than 50 are
given in bold. For the second comparison, dN/dS rate ratios were
repeatedly inferred with the 2-ratio model, in which only the branch
of interest was allowed to differ from the remaining branches; the
significance of the individual branches to be different from the
remaining branches was assessed via a likelihood ratio test
comparison to the null model, in which all branches of the tree were
assumed to have identical dN/dS rate ratios; the null model had a
likelihood score of ln L = -2895.56; the probability P was calculated
from twice the likelihood difference 2ÎL between null model and
tested model; significance is indicated by * and ** for Î± = 0.1 and 0.05
according to the sequential Bonferroni procedure, respectively, and
by # and ## for Î± = 0.1 and 0.05 according to the false discovery rate,
respectively; bold dN/dS rate ratios indicate those that are significantly

the alignment in Fig. 5/Additional file 1). Since alignment
5 considered only a comparatively short part of the genes,
we additionally analyzed the clade 1 and 2 protist-type
lysozymes separately. These separate analyses allowed us
to include complete or almost complete genes and thus
additional phylogenetic information as contained in the
regions excluded in alignment 5. Here, analysis of clade 1
lysozymes was based on the alignable part of the genes
(see vertical black lines with arrows above alignment in
Fig. 5/Additional file 1; alignments 6 and 7 for protein
and DNA sequences, respectively), while that of the clade
2 lysozymes included the complete protein or DNA
sequences (alignments 8 and 9, respectively; Fig. 5/Additional file 1). We would like to emphasize that alignments

5â9 are subsets of alignment 4 as indicated in Fig. 5 and
Additional file 1 (i.e. position of indels is identical
between alignments). Cel-lys-9 was always excluded
because it did not permit reliable alignment to the other
lysozymes.
For all data sets, protein and DNA sequence alignments
yielded essentially identical tree topologies. The only differences referred to (i) the exact position of Cel-lys-7, Cellys-8, Cbr-lys-8, and the clade containing Cre-lys-8.1 and
Cre-lys-8.2 in relation to each other (alignments 4â7; Figs.
6 and 7), and (ii) the exact position of Cel-lys-5, Cel-lys-6,
Cbr-lys-6.1, Cbr-lys-6.2, and Cre-lys-6 in relation to each
other (alignments 4, 5, 8, 9; Fig. 6 and 8). Almost all of
these differences are again associated with low bootstrap
support, suggesting that the available sequences lack sufficient unambiguous phylogenetic information at these
two levels. All other relationships were consistently identified, irrespective of the alignment used, indicating the
availability of robust phylogenetic information in these
cases. The phylogenetic analysis yielded the following
information.
(i) The protist-type lysozymes fall into two distinct clades
(clade 1 and 2), which diverged before separation of the
three species (Fig. 6A).
(ii) Within clade 1, four distinct phylogenetic groups are
identified (Fig. 7A). Three of them contain one orthologue per species, indicating duplication of genes before
species separation. The fourth group includes one gene for
C. briggsae, two monophyletic genes for C. elegans, and
two monophyletic genes for C. remanei.
(iii) The inferred clade 2 topology shows less hierarchical
structure than the clade 1 topology (Fig. 8A). Here, the lys10 orthologues form a monophyletic group, which is
most closely related to Cel-lys-4. The remainder of this
clade shows a single gene from C. remanei, two monophyletic genes from C. elegans, and two monophyletic
genes from C. briggsae.
The analysis of positive selection across sequence alignments yielded a single significant result. In particular, for
the aligned clade 1 coding sequences (alignment 7, see
methods and Fig. 5) model M8 differed significantly from
both model 7 (LRT, 2ÎL = 8.786, P = 0.012) and model
8a (LRT, 2ÎL = 6.589, adjusted P = 0.005). A single alignment position was found to be subject to adaptive
sequence evolution according to the Bayes empirical
Bayes method (P = 0.99). The alignment position is found
in the middle of the genes and it is highlighted in Fig. 5.
For the other data sets, the comparisons were all insignificant

Alignment of the Caenorhabditis protist-type lysozyme amino acid sequences. The figure only shows the top quarter of the alignment. The complete alignment is given in Additional file 1. In both cases, black lines at the beginning of the alignment denote the inferred signal peptides. Alignment 4 (see methods and results) includes all taxa and the entire protein
sequences. Vertical black lines with arrows below the alignment indicate the regions used for specific DNA sequence analysis
of all protist-type lysozymes (alignment 5). Vertical black lines with arrows above the alignment indicate those regions analyzed
for the clade 1 lysozymes (alignments 6 and 7 for protein and DNA sequences, respectively). Clade 2 lysozyme analysis was
based on complete sequences (alignments 8 and 9 for protein and DNA sequences, respectively). Note that all alignments are
subsets of alignment 4, i.e. the position of indels is identical. The red box and arrow indicate the sequence position, which was
inferred to be under positive selection for the clade 1 lysozymes.

During assessment of adaptive sequence evolution along
branches, the different data sets and the two methods for
inference of statistical significance produced slightly different results. For instance for the clade 1 sequences, only
a single branch was inferred to have a dN/dS rate ratio significantly above 1 by both methods (the branch leading to
the lys-1 orthologues). In the analysis of the complete data
set (including both clade 1 and 2), the same branch was
found to be significant by only one of the two approaches.
In spite of these variations, the results from all data sets
and methods, taken together, consistently point to two
main tree regions that are likely to be subject to positive

selection: (i) the branch leading to the lys-10 orthologues
(Tables 4 and 6; Figs. 6 and 8), and (ii) the branches associated with the early radiation of the lys-1, lys-2, and lys-7/
8 orthologues (Tables 4 and 5; Figs. 6 and 7). The majority
of the remaining branches yielded a dN/dS rate ratio that
was clearly below 1, indicating purifying selection.
Characteristics and function of the different lysozymes

weight, isoelectric point, charge, and the grand average

significantly in all of these traits with the exception of
charge (Table 7). The most pronounced differences are
found between the clade 1 protist-type lysozymes and the
invertebrate-type lysozymes (posthoc tests in Table 7).
Although the two protist-type lysozyme clades are generally more similar to each other, they do show some variation, especially regarding length and weight.
For the C. elegans lysozymes the current knowledge on the
site of gene expression and the role in immune defence is
summarized in Table 8. All genes, for which data is available, appear to be expressed in the intestines. Some are
additionally expressed in neurons (Cel-lys-1), larval muscles (Cel-lys-7), or the pharynx (Cel-lys-8). The data on
immune function highlights clear differences between the
three clades. The most pronounced effect is seen for pathogen-induced gene expression. It was reported for all of
the clade 1 protist-type genes. Within this clade, individual genes vary as to their response to different pathogens
(Table 8). In contrast, both the clade 2 protist-type and
the invertebrate-type genes show considerably fewer cases
of pathogen-activation, and at the same time, several cases

of pathogen-suppression (Table 8). The above pattern is
generally confirmed by the current data on lysozyme regulation through known components of the C. elegans
immune system (Table 8). The clade 1 protist-type genes
generally appear to be under positive control of the
immune system. At the same time, they show variation as
to the importance of different regulatory factors. In contrast, the other two clades rather appear to be under negative influence of immunity pathways (Table 8).

Discussion
Evolution of Caenorhabditis lysozymes
Caenorhabditis nematodes are among the organisms with
the highest number and the most extreme diversity of lysozyme genes. Their lysozymes fall into three distinct
clades, one being part of the invertebrate-type and the
other two of the evolutionary very distant protist-type lysozymes. Moreover, the Cel-lys-9 gene from C. elegans,
which undoubtedly belongs to the protist-type lysozymes
(Fig. 2), shows only limited similarities to the other nematode genes and it may thus represent a class of its own.
To date, it is impossible to say whether the invertebrate-

type and the protist-type lysozymes evolved from a common ancestor or not. In the latter case, their general similarity as lysozymes would be a consequence of convergent
evolution towards a similar function in defence or digestion. Additional data from more basal nematode as well
as metazoan taxa (e.g. cnidarians, poriferans, platyhelminths) is required to distinguish between these alternatives.
Some of the Caenorhabditis lysozyme genes are found in
clusters within the genome, as known for about one fifth
of the protein-coding genes of C. elegans and apparently
characteristic for genes involved in interactions with the
environment [26]. Thus, lysozymes may be subject to similar evolutionary dynamics recently described for several
of the clustered gene families [27]. These clustered gene
families are most likely shaped by concerted molecular
evolution. They are characterized by species-specific
clades of the gene clusters, the presence of inverted genes
that have been proposed to stabilize concerted evolution
of clusters over time, and strong purifying selection [27].
However, the inferred evolutionary history of lysozyme
clearly contrasts with such patterns. Genes in close
genomic proximity do not form species-specific phylogenetic clades. None of the genomic lysozyme clusters con-

tain "stabilizing" genes with inverted orientation in the
middle of the cluster. Furthermore, although the majority
of genes appears to be subject to purifying selection, we
did obtain a strong indication for several episodes of
diversifying selection.
We conclude that the lysozymes follow a different evolutionary trajectory. Our analysis reveals three main patterns.
(i) Gene duplication prior to species separation and maintenance of the duplicated genes. This scenario is most evident where lysozyme orthologues are monophyletic and
distributed in synteny across genomes in all three taxa, e.g.
the protist-type lys-1, lys-2, and lys-3 genes. Other likely
cases are the protist-type lys-6, lys-8, lys-10, and the invertebrate-type ilys-4 and ilys-5 genes, for which corresponding orthologues fall into monophyletic clades. In all these
cases, the orthologous genes must have an age of at least
three million years, which is the minimum time since the
last most common ancestor of the three Caenorhabditis
species [28]. Their maintenance across time suggests an
important conserved biological role for each group of
orthologues. In this case, their original divergence after
gene duplication may have been favoured by diversifying

selection and thus, it may associate with signatures of
adaptive sequence evolution. Such a signature is indeed
found for the clade 1 protist-type lysozymes (including
lys-1 to lys-3, lys-8, and orthologues).
(ii) Recent gene duplication and diversification. Phylogenetic analysis revealed five cases of lineage-specific duplication events (Figs. 4, 7, and 8). One of these cases (Creilys-4.1 and Cre-ilys4.2) is associated with a significant signature of adaptive sequence evolution, suggesting that
diversifying selection favoured lysozyme differentiation
upon duplication. The other four cases (Cre-lys-8.1 and
Cre-lys-8.2; Cbr-lys-6.1 and Cbr-lys-6.2; Cel-lys-5 and Cellys-6; Cel-lys-7 and Cel-lys-8) appear to be subject to purifying selection. This pattern indicates strong selection for
maintenance of gene function after the duplication event.
(iii) Gene duplication prior to species separation followed
by differential gene loss. This scenario appears to apply to
the Cel-ilys-1, Cel-ilys-2, Cel-ilys-3, and Cel-lys-4 genes,
which are each present in only one of the species and
diverge from internal nodes, some of them along long
branches indicative of old evolutionary age. Loss of genes

after duplication events in the other Caenorhabditis species may then suggest redundant functions of lysozymes
in these taxa. As above under (i), their original diversification may have been driven by diversifying selection.
Indeed, two episodes of adaptive sequence evolution were
found to associate with these genes (Figs. 4A, 8A).
Phylogenetic inferences can only yield an approximation
of the past and thus come with some uncertainty. Considering that the inferred relationships are generally supported by high bootstrap values and that they are based
on the maximum likelihood approach, which was shown
in the past to be less susceptible to biases (e.g. longbranch attraction) than other tree reconstruction methods
[29], our results should provide a realistic image of
Caenorhabditis lysozyme evolution. Taken together, their
lysozyme repertoire is shaped by both ancestral and recent
gene duplications. Sequence evolution is to a large extent
determined by purifying selection. Yet, it also includes
several episodes of diversifying selection, which associate
with ancient as well as recent duplications. To our knowledge, similar evolutionary dynamics have not as yet been
inferred for the lysozymes from other taxa.

It is worth noting that we did not find an indication for
adaptive sequence evolution between the two main protist-type clades (Fig. 6, Table 4). Two explanations are conceivable. On the one hand, differentiation of the two
clades was not subject to diversifying selection. On the
other hand, diversifying selection was important but
could not be detected due to a lack of power of the analy-

sis, which had to be based on a reduced data set including
only the conserved sequence regions that could be reliably
aligned across the different genes and taxa. At the same
time, this specific result (as well as all other cases of comparatively long branches with dN/dS rate ratios below 1)
strongly suggests that our analysis is not compromised by
a possible saturation of synonymous substitutions along
long branches, which could have led to underestimated dS
rates and thus artificially high dN/dS rate ratios. It is also
worth noting that only a single alignment site was inferred
to be under positive selection in our analyses. This is unusual because in most immunity gene data sets associated
with adaptive sequence evolution a larger number of positively selected sites is identified, e.g. in MHC class I receptors [30,31]. A possible reason is that the different
evolutionary lineages vary as to the position of the positively selected sites or that only few lineages are subject to
positive selection on specific sites. In both cases, the
method employed would hinder detection of these positively selected sites because it assumes the same pattern of
selection across all lineages [25]. We did not attempt to
perform an analysis, in which dN/dS ratios are allowed to

vary simultaneously across sites and lineages, because
these types of analyses may be liable to higher error rates
[32,33]. The single site, which we identified to be under
positive selection, is thus predicted to be of main â albeit
currently unknown â functional importance.
Functional diversification
Gene duplications are likely to be one of the main sources
of evolutionary innovation [16]. The duplicated genes
may acquire new functions (neo-functionalisation) or
they may partition the multiple functions of the ancestral
gene (sub-functionalisation) [17]. The relevance of either

alternative as well as additional scenarios is a topic of
intense current debate [34-38]. Importantly, in all cases
the genetic diversity of duplicates is predicted to translate
into functional diversity. Such a pattern is found in the
ruminantia, which possess at least five different lysozyme
types: the stomach, tracheal, intestinal, kidney, and milk
lysozymes [10]. The first type is involved in digestion,
whereas the others may function as antibacterial enzymes
in immunity [10]. A similar pattern is observed for the at
least eleven different Drosophila lysozymes. Most of them
have a digestive role and show specialisation as to their
time and site of expression [5,14]. A recent study additionally suggested an anti-fungal immune function for
some of the genes (Lys B, C, D, E and CG16756) [39]. A
further example includes the nine lysozymes of the mosquito Anopheles gambiae, which vary as to their role in
immunity and digestion and also as to their time and
location of expression [15].
The Caenorhabditis lysozymes show clear signatures of
functional diversification. Pronounced differences
between the three main clades and also within each of the
clades are observed for molecular characteristics of the
genes, their pathogen-induced expression, and also their
regulation by the immune system. Based on the current
data, it appears that the protist-type clade 1 lysozymes
play an important role in immunity: They are all induced
upon pathogen exposure. Most of them are under positive
control of immunity pathways, including components of
the insulin-like signalling cascade (DAF-16) [40-42], the
p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway
(SEK-1 and PMK-1) [43], the TGF-Î² pathway (DBL-1,
SMA-2) [44], or the GATA transcription factor ELT-2 [45].
Most interestingly, the different genes from this clade vary
in their response to pathogens and immunity pathways.
This variation may contribute to high immune specificity,
as has recently been identified phenomenologically for

invertebrates [46-48] and which is consistent with highly
specific C. elegans-pathogen interactions [49]. Although
the underlying molecular mechanisms are currently
unknown, they are likely to be based on the genetic diversification of pathogen recognition receptors and/or
immune effectors such as the lysozymes [21,50,51]. They
may also include the synergistic interaction between different components of the immune system [51], as generally known for lysozymes and antimicrobial peptides
[5,7,52,53]. In C. elegans, the immune function has been
tested for two genes of the clade 1 protist-type lysozymes.
Overexpression of Cel-lys-1 enhances resistance against S.
marcescens [20], whereas silencing of Cel-lys-7 increases
susceptibility to M. nematophilum [19]. The importance of
lysozyme diversification for immunity in general and also
for immune specificity clearly warrants further investigation.
The role of the invertebrate-type and also the clade 2 protist-type lysozymes is as yet unclear. The only exception
may be Cel-ilys-3. Its silencing enhances susceptibility to
M. nematophilum [19]. In the same study, no effect was
observed after Cel-ilys-2 knock-down [19]. In general,
both invertebrate-type and clade 2 protist-type lysozymes
are less often activated by pathogens than the clade 1 protist-type lysozymes. At the same time, several of the genes

are downregulated by pathogens and by known immunity
pathways. The latter observation may suggest that their
main function somehow interferes with the immune
response. A similar finding was made for some of the
digestive lysozymes from D. melanogaster, which are also
downregulated upon immune challenge [5]. This particular similarity may indicate that the primary function of
these nematode lysozymes is also digestion. The information on their molecular characteristics (e.g. isoelectric
point) or the localization of gene expression is consistent
with a role in both immunity and digestion. Unfortunately, the nematode's intestines are the main location for
bacterial digestion and at the same time immune defence
against pathogens that are easily taken up during feeding
[54]. Therefore, lysozymes are expected to have similar
characteristics (e.g. regarding pH optimum) even if they
vary in function. Future analyses should thus be performed with either exclusive food bacteria or exclusive
pathogens, in order to distinguish between the alternative
functions.

Conclusion
Our study provides an evolutionary framework for understanding lysozyme diversification in Caenorhabditis nematodes. The comprehensive lysozyme repertoire falls into
three distinct clades and it is shaped by both purifying

selection and several episodes of adaptive sequence evolution. The genetic diversification appears to translate into
functional differentiation. The information obtained
should prove useful as a primer for future analysis of lysozyme function in digestion and immunity. The
Caenorhabditis lysozymes may further serve as an example
of the importance of evolution by gene duplication in
invertebrate immune systems.

Methods
Sequence alignments
For the three considered Caenorhabditis species, protein
and DNA sequences of annotated genes with similarities
to known lysozymes were obtained from wormbase [55].
Three main alignments were generated (alignments 1, 2,
and 4; see below). The first one of these, alignment 1,
served to infer the general phylogenetic relationship of the
C. elegans lysozymes to those from other taxa. We specifically considered taxa, which were included in similar lysozyme phylogenetic analyses in the past [8,56,57], thus
allowing comparison between our results and those from
previous studies. The alignment was produced with the
hierarchical method, implemented in the programme
CLUSTALW [58] and using the default settings. The resulting alignment contained substantial sequence variation.
Moreover, variations of the programme settings (gap
open, gap extension, and gap distance penalties) resulted
in differences among generated alignments. Therefore,
positional homology across alignment 1 may not be
entirely reliable. Since it is based on the hierarchical alignment method (i.e. similar sequences are aligned first, followed by subsequent addition of less similar sequences),
it should still be informative as to the general phylogenetic position of the Caenorhabditis lysozymes in comparison to those from other taxa.

The more detailed analysis of Caenorhabditis lysozyme
evolution was based on the main alignments 2 and 4. Six
additional alignments were extracted from these two
alignments (see below, alignments 3, 5â9). In particular,
alignments 2 and 3 served to analyse the invertebrate-type
lysozymes. The overall phylogeny of the protist-type lysozymes from nematodes and one outgroup taxon was
examined with alignment 4. Five additional alignments
were extracted from alignment 4 for the detailed analysis
of lysozyme evolution (alignments 5â9). Here, we
excluded highly variable sequence regions from alignments, if these could not be recovered in identical form
under alternative settings of the alignment programme
(only relevant for alignments 5â7), in order to ensure a
high likelihood of positional homology and thus a
reduced risk of homoplasy. Alignments 4â9 are subsets of
each other with identical position of indels as indicated in
Fig. 5.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/114

(i) Alignment 1 included protein sequences of all lysozyme genes from C. elegans but none of the other
Caenorhabditis species. The C. elegans genes were combined with lysozymes from various taxa that have previously been considered in similar phylogenetic analyses
[8,56,57], including the chicken-type lysozyme from
chicken (Gallus gallus, accession number CAA23711), one
of the chicken-type lysozymes from mice (Mus musculus,
AAA39473), the goose-type lysozyme from chicken
(NP_001001470), two chicken-type and one invertebratetype lysozymes from D. melanogaster (NP_523882 [previously AAF47448], NP_476828 [previously AAF47452],
and CAA21317), one chicken-type and one invertebratetype lysozyme from the mosquito Anopheles gambiae
(AAC47326, AAT51799), the invertebrate-type lysozymes
from the cestode Tapes japonica (BAB33389), the molluscs
Mytilus
edulis
(AAN16207),
Chlamys
islandica
(CAB63451), and Calyptogena sp. 1 (AF334666), the leech
Hirudo medicinalis (AAA96144) and the sea star Asterias
rubens (AAR29291), and four protist-type lysozymes from
Dictyestelium discoideum (XP_644284, AAM08434,
AAB06786, XP_643993), two from Entamoeba histolytica
(AAC67235, Q27650), and one from Tetrahymena thermophila (XP_001008528), and one lysozyme from a T4
entobacteria phage (1LYD).
(ii) Alignment 2 contained protein sequences of all invertebrate-type lysozymes from the three Caenorhabditis species (Fig. 3).
(iii) Alignment 3 is the DNA version of alignment 2.
(iv) Alignment 4 has all protein sequences of the
Caenorhabditis protist-type lysozymes and also one from
D. discoideum (XP_644284).
(v) Alignment 5 is the modified DNA version of alignment 4. Here, we excluded the taxon D. discoideum and
additionally one 5' and one 3' end region, which could
not be aligned reliably at the DNA sequence level. The
excluded region at the 5' end corresponds to positions 1
to 149 and that at the 3' end to positions 301 to 345 of the
protein sequence alignment (see Fig. 5).
(vi) Alignment 6 represents a subset of alignment 4. It
contains the Caenorhabditis protein sequences of the clade
1 protist-type lysozymes, whereby we excluded a fragment
at the 5' end (positions 1 to 67; Fig. 5), another fragment
towards the 3' end (positions 314 to 331; Fig. 5), and a
small region at the 3' end (positions 339 to 345; Fig. 5).
(vii) Alignment 7 is the DNA version of alignment 6.

(viii) Alignment 8 is again a subset of alignment 4. It
includes all complete Caenorhabditis protein sequences of
the clade 2 protist-type lysozymes (Fig. 5).
(ix) Alignment 9 is the DNA version of alignment 8.
Sequence characteristics
General properties of the different lysozymes were
inferred with the help of the ProtParam tool of the ExPASy
server [59,60], including protein length, molecular
weight, isoelectric point (pI), charge, and also the grand
average of hydrophobicity. Differences in these traits
between lysozyme clades were assessed with an analysis of
variance (ANOVA) and posthoc Tukey-Kramer comparisons, using the program JMP IN 5.1.2 (SAS Institute Inc.).
The presence and position of a signal peptide was inferred
with the SIGNALP 3.0 server [61]. Further information on
the genomic location, the function and also regulation of
the C. elegans lysozymes were taken from wormbase [55]
and the current literature.
Phylogenetic tree inference
Phylogenies were reconstructed using the maximum likelihood (ML) optimality criterium [23]. For protein
sequence alignments, the optimal substitution model was
first inferred using the program ProtTest version 1.3 [62]
and the Akaike information criterion, following the recommended approach [63,64]. The optimal substitution
model was employed for a heuristic tree search with the
help of the program PhyML [65,66] using default settings.
The robustness of the inferred tree topology was evaluated
via non-parametric bootstrapping [67] based on 200 replicate data sets.

For DNA sequence alignments, the optimal substitution
model was found using the same strategy as above and as
implemented in the program ModelTest version 3.7
[63,64,68]. The phylogenetic tree was then inferred with
the help of the ML option of the program PAUP* 4.0b10
[69], using the optimal substitution model, a heuristic
tree search based on branch-swapping by tree bisection
and reconnection (TBR), the random addition of
sequences, which was repeated ten times, and otherwise
default settings. The robustness of the tree topology was
assessed with non-parametric bootstrapping using 500
replicates.
Analysis of adaptive sequence evolution
The presence of positive selection (i.e. a dN/dS rate ratio
larger than 1) along branches of the different tree topologies or along the sequence alignments was assessed using
the ML approach implemented in the program CODEML
of the PAML package version 3.15 [70]. DNA sequences of
the coding regions were used as input data files (alignments 3, 5, 7, and 9) and the inferred unrooted ML tree

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/114

topologies as input tree files. Positive selection along
sequence alignments was inferred following recommendations [71,72]. In particular, likelihood ratio tests (LRT)
were used to compare the NS sites model 8 (8 rate categories across sequences, one of which was allowed to have a
dN/dS rate ratio larger than 1) with either NS sites model 7
(8 rate categories, none above 1) or NS sites model 8a (8
rate categories, whereby one was set to exactly 1). The significance of the comparison between models 8 and 8a was
assessed by dividing the inferred LRT probability by 2, as
recommended previously [72]. If both comparisons were
significant, then individual sites under positive selection
were identified using the Bayes empirical Bayes method
[71].
The presence of positive selection along branches was
assessed using two approaches. On the one hand, we compared a model, in which all branches were forced to have
the same dN/dS rate ratio (1-ratio model), with a model, in
which one branch was allowed to differ whereas all others
were forced to be identical (2-ratio model). Using this
approach, we tested each individual branch of a given tree
topology. The significance of the comparison was evaluated with a likelihood ratio test [13]. We corrected for
multiple testing by adjusting the significance level according to Bonferroni [73] and the false discovery rate (FDR)
[74,75]. If a particular comparison was significant and if
the individual branch, which was allowed to differ, had a
dN/dS rate ratio larger than 1, then this was taken as an
indication for positive selection along this branch.
On the other hand, we assessed the significance of positive selection along branches using non-parametric bootstrapping. In particular, we first used the free-ratio model,
in which all branches were allowed to vary, in order to calculate dN/dS rate ratios for each individual branch of the
topology. The significance of a value either above or
below 1 was tested by repeating the calculations on 100
bootstrapped data sets. Non-parametric bootstrapping of
the data was performed in consideration of the coding
structure of the genes using the program CODEML of the
PAML package [70]. If a specific branch had a dN/dS rate
ratio larger 1 and bootstrap support of more than 50, then
this was taken as an indication of positive selection.
