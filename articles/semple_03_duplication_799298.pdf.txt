Abstract

The vertebrate innate immune system provides protection
against a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms, and
defensins are an important component of this response as
well as having a role in adaptive immunity. In mammals, the
defensins can be divided into the ␣- and ␤-defensin subfamilies on the basis of differences in the spacing of six, conserved

cysteine residues. The ␣-defensins are produced by neutrophils and intestinal Paneth cells, whereas the ␤-defensins
are mainly produced by epithelial cells in contact with the
environment. The functions of human ␤-defensins seem to
be disrupted in cystic fibrosis and inflammatory skin lesions
such as psoriasis [1,2]. A fuller knowledge of the human
complement of ␤-defensins may therefore be useful in

interactions

Conclusions: We conclude that the 8p22-p23 locus has evolved by successive rounds of
duplication followed by substantial divergence involving positive selection, to produce a diverse
cluster of paralogous genes established before the human-baboon divergence more than 23
million years ago. Positive selection, disproportionately favoring alterations in the charge of
amino-acid residues, is implicated as driving second exon divergence in these genes.

refereed research

Results: In addition to known genes in the region we report the genomic structures and
expression patterns of four novel human ␤-defensin genes and a related pseudogene. These genes
show an unusual pattern of evolution, with rapid divergence between second exon sequences
that encode the mature ␤-defensin peptides matched by relative stasis in first exons that encode
signal peptides.

Background: Innate immunity is the first line of defense against microorganisms in vertebrates
and acts by providing an initial barrier to microorganisms and triggering adaptive immune
responses. Peptides such as ␤-defensins are an important component of this defense, providing a
broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria and several
enveloped viruses. ␤-defensins are small cationic peptides that vary in their expression patterns
and spectrum of pathogen specificity. Disruptions in ␤-defensin function have been implicated in
human diseases, including cystic fibrosis, and a fuller understanding of the variety, function and
evolution of human ␤-defensins might form the basis for novel therapies. Here we use a
combination of laboratory and computational techniques to characterize the main human
␤-defensin locus on chromosome 8p22-p23.

understanding human disease as well as in the design of
novel, synthetic antimicrobial peptides.
The known human ␤-defensin genes show a conserved twoexon structure: the first exon encodes a signal peptide
whereas the second exon encodes a short propiece and the
mature defensin peptide with a characteristic six-cysteine
motif and many basic amino-acid residues [3]. The
␤-defensin genes are present at five syntenic loci in the
human and mouse genomes, with the main locus on human
chromosome 8p22-23 and mouse chromosome 8A3 [4]. All
four, full-length, human ␤-defensins that are present in the
public databases are from 8p22-23 (GenBank sequence
accession numbers are human ␤-defensin 1 or DEFB1,
Q09753; DEFB4 (formerly DEFB2), O15263; DEFB103 (formerly DEFB3), NP_061131; DEFB104 (formerly DEFB4),
CAC85520), but there are substantial differences in their
coding sequences, expression patterns and antimicrobial
activities. DEFB1 is constitutively expressed in many tissues
(respiratory tract, kidney, urogenital and oral cavity epithelia) whereas DEFB4 is expressed in response to bacterial
infection or proinflammatory agonists in respiratory tract
epithelial cells, and epidermal and gingival keratinocytes.
Both DEFB1 and DEFB4 proteins have salt-sensitive, bactericidal activity against a spectrum of Gram-positive and
Gram-negative enteric, urinary tract, and respiratory bacteria in vitro [5]. DEFB103 is expressed in epithelial cells,
adult heart, skeletal muscle, placenta and fetal thymus, it has
broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity under conditions of
low salt and (unusually among ␤-defensins) it retains activity against Staphylococcus aureus even in physiological
saline. DEFB104 achieves highest expression in the testis
(with lower levels in gastric antrum, neutrophils, uterus,
thyroid, lung and kidney) and was found to be inducible in
the respiratory epithelium upon exposure to Pseudomonas
aeruginosa or Streptococcus pneumoniae [3].
The evolution of various genes involved in the vertebrate
immune system has involved duplication followed by selection to provide responses to a wide range of pathogens, with
well documented examples in immunoglobulin [6] and
major histocompatibility complex genes [7]. Hughes and
Yeager [8] studied the evolution of ␣-defensins and found
evidence for duplication followed by diversification driven
by positive selection. Similar phenomena were also implicated in the evolution of bovine ␤-defensins [9] and amphibian antimicrobial peptides [10]. In contrast, DEFB1 was
found not to vary significantly across primates [11].
Here we describe a combined strategy to identify further
␤-defensin genes in the draft human genome sequence using
computational techniques and verification using reverse
transcription-PCR. Four full-length, novel genes (DEFB105,
DEFB106, DEFB107, DEFB108) and a related pseudogene
DEFB109p are reported, as well as their expression patterns and
evidence for their evolution by duplication and positive selection.

Results
All TBLASTX [12] matches to human bacterial artificial
chromosome (BAC) clone sequences were in the 8p22-p23
region in a subsection of FPC contig ctg45 (1 April freeze
WashU Accession Map Layout Files [13]) bounded by the
BAC clones RP11-161B1 (AC079018) and SCb-177K12
(AF252831) and consisting of 53 BACs in total. These 53
BACs were deemed to represent the human ␤-defensin gene
family locus and were masked for repetitive sequences using
RepeatMasker [14]. This locus was the subject of a more sensitive search for the presence of novel human ␤-defensins,
using a hidden Markov model constructed from an alignment of the GenBank ␤-defensin sequences mentioned
above. As well as the known, full-length human ␤-defensins
and the related epididymis-specific SPAG11 (formerly EP2)
gene [15], two novel ␤-defensin genes, DEFB105 and
DEFB106, were identified in this search and were then
incorporated into the previous hidden Markov model.
Further searches with this revised model identified a further
three genes: DEFB107, DEFB108 and DEFB109p. None of
these five genes was found in the EMBL sequence database
(24 June 2002 release) or in the Ensembl genomic annotation database (version 6.28.1 [16]). The novel gene
DEFB109p appears to be a pseudogene as it contains a premature stop codon within its first exon, as observed in three
independently sequenced, overlapping 8p22-p23 BAC
sequences (accession numbers AC068974, AC087203 and
AF252830). Given the absence of premature stop codons in
the other four genes, despite considerable divergence among
them (they encode only 18-28% identical amino-acid
residues), it is unlikely that they too are pseudogenes.
Many putative final exon fragments from novel mouse
␤-defensins were recently reported by Schutte et al. [4].
However, their data were incomplete and were not supported by experimental verification. They used computational techniques to identify sequences matching a central
portion of the mature defensin peptide including the six-cysteine motif characteristic of ␤-defensins. At best, this
method could only identify incomplete final exons encoding
this region of the peptide. No attempt was made to delineate
precisely the boundaries of final exons or to identify first
exons by these authors. In the present study we restrict our
attention to complete genes, present in a BAC-clone-based
map of the region and verified as encoding real transcripts
by RT-PCR. Our full-length novel genes correspond to five
final exon fragments (DEFB5, DEFB6, DEFB7, DEFB8 and
DEFB9) reported by Schutte et al. [4] and we have adopted
the official HUGO Human Gene Nomenclature Committee
[17] names for these fragments: DEFB105, DEFB106,
DEFB107, DEFB108 and DEFB109p (amended from
DEFB109) respectively.
RT-PCR amplification confirmed the presence of the computationally predicted, functional genes, but sequencing of
these products and subsequent alignment to genomic

of DEFB107 and DEFB108 are 6.74 and 6.89 respectively,
whereas all other ␤-defensins described to date are cationic.
This relative increase in anionic residues is expected to affect
function, as the action of defensins initially involves interactions between the cationic mature defensin peptides and
anionic membrane lipids [19]. Expression analysis for the
novel, functional human genes was carried out by RT-PCR
on a panel of human RNA samples and the novel gene PCR
products were confirmed by hybridization to an internal
probe (Figure 3). Expression of all four novel genes was
readily detected in testis. A longer exposure period revealed
low levels of expression of DEFB108 in the liver (Figure 3,
left-hand panel of DEFB108). Expression was not detected
in any of the other tissues analyzed.

Figure 4 shows dN (number of nonsynonymous substitutions
per nonsynonymous site) plotted against dS (number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site) for comparisons between the first exon (which encodes the signal
peptide) and second exon (which encodes the mature
defensin) from all human and baboon genes (the full dN, dS
and dN - dS estimates for all first and second exon comparisons are available in Additional data file 7). Two major
trends are observable. In the vast majority of first exon comparisons dS exceeds dN (Figure 4a) and this excess is statistically significant in almost every case according to two-tailed
Z-test results for all human and baboon genes, but there
were no significant excesses of dS according to the more rigorous Fisher’s exact test (data not shown). Thus the rates of
substitution in first exons indicate that they are evolving
approximately neutrally, perhaps under weak purifying
selection. The pattern seen in the second exon comparisons
is quite different (Figure 4b). In the second exons dN often
exceeds dS, and even in these short sequences, for certain
comparisons this excess reaches statistical significance. Significant excesses of dN over dS are seen between DEFB1 and

reports

Six genes highly similar (85-98% identical at the amino-acid
level) to three of the novel human ␤-defensins (DEFB105,
DEFB106 and DEFB107) as well as to DEFB4, DEFB103 and
DEFB104, were found within two olive baboon (Papio cynocephalus anubis) draft genomic sequences (GenBank accession numbers AC116558 and AC116559) using BLAST.
Full-length sequences were obtained for each baboon gene
except the putative DEFB4 ortholog (which lacks a first exon
because of gaps in the draft genomic sequences); in all other
cases the exonic structure of the putative baboon ortholog
was identical to that of the human gene (Figure 2). It is very
likely that these sequences originate from the baboon locus
orthologous to the human region under study, but without
more complete sequence or mapping data for the baboon
genome it is impossible to be certain. These novel baboon
gene sequences (see Additional data files for the accession
numbers), together with the published sequence for olive
baboon ␤-defensin 1 (AAK61474) and the full-length human
␤-defensins formed the basis for our evolutionary analyses.

reviews

Figure 1a depicts the relative positions and orientations of
the four novel genes, the novel pseudogene DEFB109p and
four known genes in the vicinity: DEFB2-4 and the related
epididymis-specific SPAG11. This cluster is about 350 kilobases (kb) centromeric of the DEFB1 gene. A phylogenetic
tree relating functional human ␤-defensins (Figure 1b)
reflects the spatial distribution of these genes, with the
cluster of genes in Figure 1a appearing to form a clade separate from DEFB1. The simplest explanation for the origin of
this cluster is a series of local duplication events followed by
substantial divergence. In addition it seems that the four
novel functional genes are more closely related to DEFB104
than to DEFB4 or DEFB103. Three of these genes, DEFB106,
DEFB105 and DEFB108, encode mature peptides exhibiting
the same spacing of conserved cysteine residues as seen in
DEFB104, although in DEFB105 there is an extra cysteine
residue (amino acid 43) towards the amino-terminal end of
the mature peptide. DEFB105 also encodes an unusually
long propiece peptide region in the second of its three exons.
Strikingly, the DEFB107 protein lacks the first canonical
␤-defensin cysteine altogether and instead has a serine
residue at the same position (Figure 2). The changes in the
number of cysteine residues seen in DEFB105 and DEFB107
are likely to have important functional consequences. The
predicted mature peptides for the four novel, functional
␤-defensins presented here have a similar proportion of
cationic residues to human DEFB104, with higher proportions of anionic residues (10-13%) than are seen in human
DEFB1, DEFB4 and DEFB103 (less than 4%). Indeed the pI

sequence also uncovered several instances where the actual
gene structures differed from those that were predicted. In
two cases, DEFB106 and DEFB107, splice sites other than
those predicted were used and it was found that the predicted coding sequences had been respectively 36 base-pairs
(bp) longer and 9 bp shorter than the actual coding
sequences. In the case of DEFB105 RT-PCR verified the two
predicted exons but also uncovered an additional, 42-bp
intervening exon. The RT-PCR analysis also produced interesting results with respect to the coding sequence of
DEFB108. In four independent, sequenced RT-PCR products from one mRNA sample, the amplified DEFB108
sequence was consistently found to differ from the computationally predicted sequence from the human public draft
sequence at three nucleotide sites, but was otherwise identical. The three differences observed between predicted and
amplified sequences respectively were an A to G at
nucleotide 62 (which causes a conservative amino-acid
change from lysine to arginine), a T to C at nucleotide 111
(which is a synonymous change) and a C to T at nucleotide
120 (also synonymous). This indicates novel human polymorphisms in DEFB108 and is consistent with observations
of high degrees of polymorphism for other human ␤defensins [18] (see also Additional data files 1-6 for the novel
gene sequences confirmed by RT-PCR and the computationally predicted sequence of DEFB109p).

effects seen among the second exons of orthologous baboon
genes (Table 1) using the method of Nei and Gojobori [20].
Moreover, in these comparisons dS tends to be rather low
relative to the rest of the data set (mean dS = 0.464).
Similar results are obtained using this method either modified to take account of the transition-to-transversion ratio R
[21] or using the Jukes-Cantor correction, although the
unmodified method is thought to be a more reliable basis

for the detection of positive selection [22]. If we assume
that synonymous substitutions (which are selectively
neutral or nearly so) have accumulated regularly with time,
such a pattern of substitution suggests that duplication was
followed by rapid nonsynonymous change that subsequently decelerated. Most comparisons involving the
second exons of DEFB103, DEFB104 and DEFB107 with the
second exons of other genes in the dataset show excesses of
dN over dS, but these excesses fail to reach significance by
either of the tests used (data not shown). Although some of

sequence is available (DEFB103, DEFB104, DEFB105,
DEFB106 and DEFB107): each pair shares 74-91% identity
over 80-99% of their lengths in spite of many small indel
events. In every case these pairs of orthologous introns show a
substitution rate that is not significantly different from the
value of dS obtained for the coding sequences. In particular, the
orthologous intron sequence comparisons for DEFB103,
DEFB104 and DEFB107 give substitution-rate estimates of
0.106Ϯ0.010, 0.081Ϯ0.005 and 0.066Ϯ0.004 respectively,
which are consistent with the dS estimates for the coding
sequences of these pairs: 0.166Ϯ0.077, 0.085Ϯ0.058 and
0.053Ϯ0.049. Thus, the excess of nonsynonymous substitutions observed for the second exons of these genes is not attributable to artificially low dS estimates as a result of sampling
error, but is caused by a real increase in dN relative to dS, which
is the pattern expected to be generated by positive selection.
Averages for the ratio of radical to conservative amino-acid
changes, pR/pC calculated over 47 mammalian genes were
reported as 0.81 and 0.49 for charge and the Miyata-Yasunaga

equivalent values from Table 1, for comparisons between the
second exons of genes showing evidence of positive selection,
are all greater than these averages. Furthermore Table 1

shows that there has been a higher rate of change with
respect to charge than with respect to polarity and volume
(Miyata-Yasunaga amino-acid classification). That is, where
there is evidence of positive selection, most nonsynonymous
changes have tended to change the charges of the residues
encoded but have tended to conserve the polarities and
volumes of those residues.
Likelihood ratio tests (LRTs), as implemented by the PAML
package [24] also indicate the operation of positive selection

essentially a test of variability in the ␻ ratio among sites and
does not constitute a rigorous test of positive selection.
Model M1 (neutral) assumes two site classes with ␻ = 0 and
␻1 = 1 fixed and with the proportions p and p1 estimated.
Model M2 (selection) adds a third site class with the ratio ␻2
estimated, it suggests that about 47% of sites are under positive selection with ␻2 = 53.17 and identified 12 amino-acid
sites under positive selection at the 95% cutoff. The two
models can be compared using an LRT as follows, 2⌬l =
-1030.51 -(-1022.03) = 16.97; p < 0.001 with 2 df. So model
M2 is significantly better than M1. Model M7 (beta) assumes
a beta distribution for ␻ over sites. The beta distribution is
limited to values between 0 and 1, providing the most flexible null hypothesis for testing positive selection. Model M8
(beta+␻) adds another site class to M7 (beta), with the ␻
ratio estimated from the data. However, the difference
between M7 and M8 is not statistically significant, as indicated by the LRT: 2⌬l = -1006.44 -(-1006.44) = 0. Nine particular sites were implicated (in both M2 and M3 models) as
being under positive selection with greater than 95% confidence: positions 43, 44, 48, 52, 56, 57, 69, 70 and 73 in

at sites within second exons. These tests indicate whether
data (the substitutions inferred from an alignment) are best
explained by one of two models of ␻ = dN/dS. Since ␻ is a
measure of selective pressure on proteins, these models can
be used to assess the evidence for variable selective pressures among sites. In a test for positive selection (the presence of sites at which ␻ > 1) two statistical distributions are
compared: a null model that uses a distribution that does not
allow for sites with ␻ > 1 and another model which does
allow such sites. Three pairs of site-specific likelihood
models were compared that assume variable selective pressure (as determined by the value of ␻) among sites but no
variation among sequences in the dataset: M0 (one-ratio)
and M3 (discrete), M1 (neutral) and M2 (selection), and M7
(beta) and M8 (beta+␻) [25]. The second exon of the
pseudogene DEFB109p was omitted from the analysis. The
discrete model (M3) with two site classes suggested that 41%
of second-exon sites are under positive selection with ␻ =
1.67 and identified nine amino-acid sites under positive
selection at the 95% cutoff. M3 was a significantly better fit
to the data than the one-ratio model M0; the LRT statistic is
2⌬l = -1061.79-(-1004.12) = 115.32, and p < 0.001 with two

in determining ␤-defensin structure. In summary, the PAML
analysis indicates that ␻ varies significantly between sites, and
in two separate LRTs the parameters estimated suggest a substantial proportion of sites are under positive selection. In
spite of this, the most stringent test (M7 versus M8) does not
indicate a significant difference from neutrality. This result
may be attributable to the extremely short lengths (33 codons
aligned omitting positions with gaps) of the sequences
aligned, such an effect was seen when analyzing short (130
codons) lysozyme sequences in the same way [25].

In this study the computationally predicted gene structures
were found by laboratory work to deviate from the actual
structures in three out of five novel genes. These errors in
the predictions arose in spite of the fact that the predictions
were based on all the ␤-defensin protein-sequence data
available and involved three completed BAC sequences
rather than unfinished, gapped sequence. This has implications for purely computational approaches to novel gene discovery such as that of Schutte et al. [4].

duplication since the divergence of rodents and primates;
alternatively, there could have been a loss of these genes in
the rodent lineage. They are also the best candidates for
primate-specific ␤-defensins as they lack orthologs within all
other known mammalian defensins, although our knowledge
of mammalian defensins is currently incomplete. As we have
shown, the evolution of the DEFB104 mature peptide has
been driven by positive selection since its emergence, which
is consistent with its novel antimicrobial properties [26]. All
defensins were thought to exist as monomers stabilized by
three disulfide bridges between their three pairs of conserved cysteines [19]. However, when compared with other
known human ␤-defensins (DEFB1, DEFB4 and DEFB103),
DEFB104 was found to have a different number of residues
between its second and third, and between its fourth and
fifth cysteine residues. Furthermore, DEFB104 was found to
have bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa
that was more than sixfold stronger than for any other
␤-defensin [26]. Three of the novel genes described here
(DEFB105, DEFB106 and DEFB108) encode mature peptides exhibiting the same spacing of conserved cysteine
residues as seen in DEFB104 as well as sharing similar
expression patterns, with highest expression in the testes.
The functional divergence of ␤-defensin genes appears to
have continued following human-baboon divergence, as
exemplified by DEFB107 which displays a serine residue
instead of the first canonical cysteine seen in the baboon
ortholog. It is notable that a novel mouse ␤-defensin gene
(Defr1), which also lacks the first canonical cysteine, has
potent antimicrobial activity against a spectrum of pathogens
[27]. In addition a polymorphism in the DEFB1 gene which
alters the first canonical cysteine to a serine residue has been
shown to produce a peptide which is as active against the
microorganisms tested as the usual form [28]. The unusual
amino-acid composition of the proteins encoded by the novel
genes presented here suggests that they may possess novel
functions, indeed the cationic nature of ␤-defensins is lost in
DEFB107 and DEFB108. As shown recently, there may be
more subtle consequences of variation in ␤-defensin protein
sequences, affecting dimerization as well as net charge and
disulfide bridges [29]. It is worth noting that recent research
has identified additional functions for ␤-defensins that link
the innate and adaptive immune response. Both human and
mouse ␤-defensins have been shown to be chemotactic for
immature dendritic cells and memory T cells via the CCR6
chemokine receptor [30]. The mouse ␤-defensin Defb2 has
been shown to act directly on immature dendritic cells as an
endogenous ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4), inducing
upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules and dendritic cell
maturation. These events, in turn, trigger robust, type-1
polarized adaptive immune responses in vivo, which suggests
that ␤-defensins may have an important role in immunosurveillance against pathogens [31].

DEFB104 and DEFB108 have no detectable orthologs in
the mouse genome and therefore appear to have arisen by

The expression of the novel antimicrobial peptides reported
here in the human male reproductive tract is also of interest.

Discussion
This study represents the most detailed study of a human
␤-defensin cluster to date, including the full-length sequences of
four novel genes (DEFB105, DEFB106, DEFB107, DEFB108),
and a novel pseudogene (DEFB109p), their expression patterns and sequences for the baboon orthologs of six genes
from this cluster. The 8p22-23 defensin locus appears to have
evolved by successive rounds of duplication followed by substantial divergence, to produce a diverse cluster of paralogous
genes defined by these four novel genes and four known
␤-defensin genes (DEFB4, DEFB103 and DEFB104). Divergence has been most rapid within the second exons of these
genes, which encode the mature ␤-defensin peptide, with
many comparisons between paralogous genes showing an
excess of nonsynonymous over synonymous substitutions.
Statistically significant evidence of elevated nonsynonymous
change is seen by two methods in the second exons, indicating
the action of positive selection. By contrast, comparisons
between the first exons of genes from this cluster, which
encode a signal peptide, show an excess of synonymous substitutions consistent with neutral evolution or weak purifying
selection. The duplication and subsequent positive selection of
these genes predates human-baboon divergence more than 23
million years ago and is consistent with observations that
DEFB1 has undergone very little change during the evolution
of primates [11]. The positive selection observed has tended to
change the charges of residues encoded more than other qualities such as residue polarity or volume. As seems to be the case
with other antimicrobial peptides, such as MHC receptors,
immunoglobulins and ␣-defensins [6-8], this selection may be
a response to the rapid evolution of pathogens.

All phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbourjoining method [36] based on the proportion of amino-acid
sites at which sequences compared were different and omitting alignment gaps. The trees constructed were rooted with
chicken gallinacin 1 (GGGAL1; P46156) and the reliability of
each branch was assessed using 1,000 bootstrap replications. In pairwise comparisons between nucleotide
sequences, the number of synonymous substitutions per
synonymous site (dS) and the number of nonsynonymous
substitutions per nonsynonymous site (dN) were estimated
using the method of Nei and Gojobori [20], modified to take
account of the transition-to-transversion ratio R [21]. R was
estimated using the method of Kumar and Nei [22]. In addition, the Jukes-Cantor correction [37] was applied to
account for multiple substitutions at the same site. Two
codon-based tests of selection were used. Both tests are
based on estimates of dS and dN. Standard errors for dS and
dN were calculated using 1,000 bootstrap replicates. In the
first test dS and dN and their respective variances are used in
a two-tailed Z-test to test the null hypothesis that dN - dS = 0
[21]. In the second test, Fisher’s exact test is used to test the
null hypothesis that the proportions of synonymous and
non-synonymous differences are the same [38]. Additional
tests for the presence of sites under positive selection were
carried out using the PAML package [24], which uses likelihood ratio tests (LRT) to compare models of the variation in
dN/dS ratio between sites. The six models recommended by
Anisimova et al. [39] were tested: M0 (one-ratio), M1
(neutral), M2 (selection), M3 (discrete), M7 (beta), and M8
(beta+␻). Intron sequences were aligned using DIALIGN
(version 2.1 [40]) and the numbers of substitutions between
them were estimated using Kimura’s two-parameter method
[41]. All phylogenetic trees, distance calculations and codonbased tests of selection were carried out using MEGA2 [42].
Estimates of the proportions of radical and conservative
nonsynonymous substitutions, along with their standard
errors, were made using the HON-NEW program [23] in an
extension of earlier methods for the measurement of conservative and radical substitution rates [43]. The radical or conservative nature of nonsynonymous substitutions was
assessed with respect to charge and to the polarity and
volume of the amino acids (the Miyata-Yasunaga amino-acid
classification [44]).

The 8p22-23 ␤-defensin locus has evolved by duplication and
subsequent divergence, to produce a diverse cluster of paralogous genes defined by four novel genes (DEFB105, DEFB106,
DEFB107, DEFB108), a novel pseudogene (DEFB109p), and
three known genes (DEFB4, DEFB103 and DEFB104). We
present full-length sequences for the four novel genes, their
expression patterns and the predicted sequences for the
baboon orthologs of six genes from this cluster. Although
comparisons among first-exon sequences of these human
genes show little variation, the second-exon sequences that
encode the mature ␤-defensin peptides show substantial
divergence. Evolutionary analyses suggest that the divergence seen in second exons has involved positive selection
disproportionately favoring alterations in the charge of
amino-acid residues.

comment

Recent work has shown that the male urogenital tracts in
mammals express a broad range of ␣- and ␤-defensins, with
human DEFB1 expressed in testicular biopsies, seminal
plasma and ejaculated spermatozoa [32]. Together with our
results demonstrating that DEFB105, DEFB106, DEFB107
and DEFB108 are predominantly expressed in the testes,
these data suggest that the male reproductive tract has a
complex innate defense mechanism.

RT-PCR analysis of gene expression
A range of human RNA samples was purchased from Stratagene (Amsterdam, The Netherlands) (stomach, vulva, ovary,
kidney, placenta, thyroid, lung, skeletal, uterus, breast, liver,
skin, colon, heart and cervix) and human testis RNA (BD
Biosciences Clontech, Oxford). cDNA synthesis was carried
out using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Roche, Lewes,
UK) according to the instructions, using random hexameric
oligonucleotides. PCRs were carried out, using 5 ␮l of the
resultant cDNA according to the following procedures: 94°C
for 1 min followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 sec, 55°C for
30 sec and 72°C for 1 min, and a final round of extension for 5
min. Products were analyzed on a 4% NuSIEVE agarose gel
(FMC BioProducts, Rockland, ME, USA) by electrophoresis
and also cloned using pGEM-T Easy Vector System I
(Promega, Southampton). Amplification of glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was carried out in parallel with conditions as for the other amplifications, but with an
annealing temperature of 56°C. Reactions were verified for
RNA amplification by including controls without reverse transcriptase. RT-PCR products were hybridized with a radiolabeled, internal oligonucleotide probe designed to each novel
sequence to confirm the presence of the correctly amplified
product. Purified plasmid DNA was sequenced from both
strands with ABI Prism dRhodamine Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (PE Applied Biosystems, Warrington). Primers and internal probes were designed using the
Primer3 primer design program from the Whitehead Institute,
Center for Genome Research [45]. The sequences for the
primers and internal probes used were as follows: DEFB105:
5؅ primer: TCTATTTGCTATGTTCTTCATTTTGG, internal
oligo: TTCAACTGCCATCAGGTGAG, 3؅ primer: GCAGCAGAGAAAGTTCAGCC; DEFB106: 5؅ primer: CGTGCTCTTCTTTCTGACCC, internal oligo: TACAGGGAAGGTGATCGGAG, 3؅ primer: GTTCTTCATTTTTCCCGCAA; DEFB107: 5؅
