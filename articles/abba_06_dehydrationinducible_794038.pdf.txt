Abstract
Background: The expressed sequence tag M6G10 was originally isolated from a screening for
differentially expressed transcripts during the reproductive stage of the white truffle Tuber borchii.
mRNA levels for M6G10 increased dramatically during fruiting body maturation compared to the
vegetative mycelial stage.
Results: Bioinformatics tools, phylogenetic analysis and expression studies were used to support
the hypothesis that this sequence, named TbDHN1, is the first dehydrin (DHN)-like coding gene
isolated in fungi. Homologs of this gene, all defined as "coding for hypothetical proteins" in public
databases, were exclusively found in ascomycetous fungi and in plants. Although complete (or
almost complete) fungal genomes and EST collections of some Basidiomycota and Glomeromycota
are already available, DHN-like proteins appear to be represented only in Ascomycota. A new and
previously uncharacterized conserved signature pattern was identified and proposed to Uniprot
database as the main distinguishing feature of this new group of DHNs. Expression studies provide
experimental evidence of a transcript induction of TbDHN1 during cellular dehydration.
Conclusion: Expression pattern and sequence similarities to known plant DHNs indicate that
TbDHN1 is the first characterized DHN-like protein in fungi. The high similarity of TbDHN1 with
homolog coding sequences implies the existence of a novel fungal/plant group of LEA Class II
proteins characterized by a previously undescribed signature pattern.

Background
Hyperosmotic conditions and low temperatures cause cellular dehydration, i.e. removal of water from the cytoplasm into the extracellular space, resulting in the
reduction of cytosolic volumes and the alteration of cellular mechanisms. Dehydrins (DHNs) are a group of heatstable plant proteins believed to play a protective role during cellular dehydration [1,2]. They accumulate during
dehydrative stress caused by or associated with low or
freezing temperatures, drought, salinity, embryo desicca-

tion and abscissic acid synthesis. Dehydrins are very rich
in glycine residues, while cysteine and tryptophane are
lacking or under-represented [3]. They are characterized
by highly conserved 15-mer lysin rich sequences, called Ksegments, which may be present one or several times, one
or more Y-segments (DEYGNP) and/or S-segments (serine cluster) [2]. The K-segment can form a putative
amphipathic α-helix structure, with the potential for both
hydrophilic and hydrophobic interaction [4]. Due to this
property, dehydrins potentially have a chaperone-like

function in stabilizing partially denatured proteins or
membranes, coating them with a cohesive water layer and
preventing their coagulation during desiccation [3]. Rinne
et al [5] demonstrated that dehydrins could help hydrolytic enzymes maintain their activity even in desiccating
environmental conditions, such as freezing. This result
confirms the general belief that dehydrins help the cell to
survive desiccation, probably creating local pools of water
that are required for survival and re-growth.
Dehydrins were initially found in flowering plants, but
immunological studies and screenings of cDNA and
genome libraries revealed that dehydrins are widely distributed in the plant kingdom [6]. In fact, they were found
in the brown algae Fucus spiralis, F. vesciculosus, and F. evanescens [7], in the lichen Selaginella lepidophylla [3] as well
as in the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. [8]. Dehydrinhomolog sequences are also present in Escherichia coli [6]
and Chlamidia trachomatis [9], and even in Drosophila melanogaster [10]. To our knowledge, dehydrins have never
been reported in fungi, even if some fungal proteins are
classified as late embryogenesis- abundant' (LEA) or LEAlike proteins. Dehydrins belong in fact to this larger protein family. The LEA protein classification proposed by
Dure [4] and Bray [11] was recently revised by Wise [12]
on the basis of the Kyte and Doolitle hydrophobicity metric, predicted secondary structures, expression patterns
and sequence features. Dehydrins are now classified in
Class IIa and Class IIb of LEA proteins, corresponding to
the previous D11 family or Group 2.
LEA proteins belonging to different classes do not share
any evident sequence similarity, even if Garay-Arroyo et
al. [13] found that they are characterized by high
hydrophilicity and high percentage of glycines, leading to
their denomination as "hydrophilins". They are synthesised in the later stages of plant embryogenesis, when
seeds are maturing and their water content is decreasing
and, in vegetative tissues, in response to water stress [14].
Their precise function is still unknown, but it has been
suggested that they are involved in protecting cellular or
molecular structures from the damaging effects of water
loss by sequestration of ions, replacement of hydrogen
bonding function of water or renaturation of unfolded
proteins [11,15]. Although primarily found in plants, a
number of putative LEA genes have been found in nonplant species, including bacteria [16,17], nematodes [18]
and fungi. The first study on a LEA-like protein in fungi
was carried out by Mtwisha et al. [14] who suggested that
HSP12 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae should be considered
as a LEA-like protein on the basis of its expression pattern
and amino acid composition. Also GRE1 from S. cerevisiae
[19] and CON6 from Neurospora crassa [20] can be
ascribed to the family of LEA proteins, because they
exhibit a high content of hydrophilic amino acids and

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/39

their corresponding transcripts accumulate respectively in
response to hyperosmosis and desiccation. Moreover, 12
fungal proteins are already classified as 'LEA 4' (named as
LEA Class III proteins by Wise [12]) under the Pfam
domain family PF02987 on the basis of the presence of at
least one IPR004238 (InterPro ID) domain.
In the framework of an expressed sequence tag project
aimed at identifying key regulators and master genes controlling the fruiting body formation in the white truffle
Tuber borchii Vittad. [21], we found that the EST called
M6G10 was the most up-regulated gene of the reproductive stage compared to the vegetative stage. Truffles are
ectomycorrhizal fungi, producing ascocarps which are
highly appreciated and commercialised for their organoleptic properties [22]. Since truffle fruiting bodies cannot yet be obtained under controlled conditions, most
studies on truffle primary and secondary metabolism are
based on vegetative mycelium cultivated in axenic conditions.
In this study, bioinformatics tools and expression studies
were used to support the hypothesis that M6G10 can be
considered not only as a LEA protein coding gene, but as
the first DHN-like coding gene isolated in fungi. In addition, homologs of this gene, all still defined as "coding for
hypothetical proteins" in public databases, were found in
other fungal ascomycetous and plant genomes. On the
basis of some physiochemical similarities to known plant
dehydrins, the identification of a new conserved signature
pattern and the expression profile in osmotic and cold
stress, we support the classification of these "hypothetical
proteins" as dehydrins belonging to Class II LEA proteins.

Results
Sequence analyses
The
771-bp-long
M6G10
fragment
[GenBank:DN601500] was one of the fruiting body-regulated
Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) retrieved from a gene
expression profiling study conducted in the ascomycetous
truffle T. borchii [21]. A blastx search against NCBI
(National Center for Biotechnology Information, NIH,
Bethesda) databases [23] using as a query the M6G10 EST
revealed the existence of a conserved, previously uncharacterised group of DHN proteins. This result was then
confirmed by using the complete TbDHN1 mRNA
sequence. Significant similarities (E-value < e-10) to other
proteins (Table 1), including a plant dehydrin from Hordeum vulgare ([GenBank: AAD02257]; blastx E = 4e-25)
(Fig. 1), were found only by masking off repeated or low
complexity regions. Dehydrins, like the majority of LEA
proteins, are low complexity proteins; in fact, applications
masking low complexity regions, like SEG [24], masked
between 30% and 71% of the amino acids of a LEA protein [12]. Since the main effect of masking low complexity

regions is to reduce the number of amino acids available
for alignment, blast searches were all performed with the
filter for low complexity regions switched off.
A blastp search on Stagonospora nodorum protein database
characterized the predicted protein SNU00161 (The
Broad Institute Accession Number) as another possible
fungal homolog of TbDHN1. A tblastx search was performed querying all those genomic projects in which a
proteomic annotation was not yet available. Other possible fungal homologs were thus identified in Botrytis cinerea
[The

Institute
Accession
Number:00133947_B.cinerea_19866915837883], Fusarium verticillioides [The Broad Institute Accession

Chetomium globosum [GenBank:AAFU01000048], Coccidioides immitis [GenBank:AAEC01000142] and C. posadisii
[TIGR
Accession
Number:gnl|TIGR_222929|contig:3250:c_posadasii]. A search in the EST databases
showed that most of these fungal proteins are present as
expressed sequences. Additionally, other DHN-like members were found within cDNA sequences of the fungi Verticillium dahliae [GenBank:BQ110173] and Trichoderma
reseii [GenBank:CF872473], and the plants Tortula ruralis
[GenBank:CN2013881], Picea engelmannii x Picea sitchensis [GenBank:DR464575], Malus x domestica [GenBank:CV091950], Oryza sativa [GenBank:CA765427] and
Saccharum officinarum [GenBank:CA105075]. For each
different species we reported only one entry, because
sequences from unfinished/unannotated genome projects
and from EST databases are always redundant. Although
blast searches were performed also on sequences from
Basidiomycota and Glomeromycota, all the retrieved fungal sequences belong exclusively to ascomycetous fungi.

Only DHN-like proteins from T. borchii, Gibberella zeae,
Neurospora crassa, Magnaporthe grisea, Aspergillus nidulans,
A. fumigatus, S. nodorum and Candida albicans were further
analysed. All the other potential fungal and plant DHN
proteins were excluded because of poor sequence quality
(especially for ESTs), i.e. high percentage of Ns or too
short fragments, and because all tblastx searches were performed on an unfinished genome project.
Besides sequence similarities, additional evidences supported the relatedness between TbDHN1, the twelve fungal uncharacterized proteins and the big family of LEA
proteins (Table 2): a) the amino acid composition
(Pepinfo analysis), e.g. richness in Gly and polar amino
acids such as Thr and Ser and lack of both Cys and Trp; b)
the high percentages of low complexity regions (SEG analysis); c) more than 50% of the polypeptide is predicted to
be structured as a random coil (Predictprotein analysis);
d) the high hydrophilicity (ProtScale analysis), e.g. maximum hydrophobicity for all sequences is 0.7 in GenBank:EAL87020 from A. fumigatus. GenBank:EAA54716
from M. grisea is the sole sequence in which cysteine and
tryptophan are present, although in a very low percentage.
Low complexity regions represented a high percentage of
each protein, with 7 sequences showing more than 30%
of their amino acids masked by SEG. The exceptions are
Swiss-Prot:Q7S6B0 from N. crassa (0%) and GenBank:EAL87020 from A. fumigatus (5%) which also
shared the lowest sequence similarity with TbDHN1.
On the basis of these physiochemical characteristics,
TbDHN1 and its fungal homologs can be assigned to the
large family of LEA.

Classification according to Wise's rules
The next step in the characterization of TbDHN1 and its
homologs was their classification within the big family of
LEA proteins. TbDHN1 and the other twelve fungal proteins were classified according to a set of rules defined by
Wise [12]. Each LEA Class is defined by a range of percentages for all the physicochemical features which usually
characterize LEA proteins: hydrophilicity, predicted secondary structure and amino acid composition. According
to this rule set, G. zeae, A. nidulans, A. fumigatus and C.

albicans proteins were placed into Class II; while the aromatic amino acid percentage of N. crassa and M. grisea
proteins and the values of minimum hydrophobicity for
T. borchii and S. nodorum proteins were out of the established ranges for this Class. It is important to point out
that, especially for N. crassa, M. grisea and T. borchii proteins, values of aromatic amino acid percentage and minimum hydrophobicity are very close to the limit of Class
II. The six fungal proteins not assigned to Class II clustered
with Class IV, but Wise concluded that members of Class

IV should be more appropriately housed in Class II and
Class III. According to Wise's analysis of LEA amino acid
composition, glycine is highly represented in Class II,
while in Class III glycine is found only marginally more
than expected by chance. Moreover, Class III LEA proteins
have high helix content. On the basis of a high percentage
of glycines in the six proteins and/or a lower percentage of
helix content than the expected one for Class III, also proteins from N. crassa, M. grisea, T. borchii and S. nodorum
can be assigned to Class II, the group of plant dehydrins.
Furthermore, blastp results obtained with TbDHN1 as
query against the nr protein database shared no common
hits with the ones obtained using as queries the fungal
proteins already classified in Class III (Pfam PF02987).
A new common signature pattern
Members of plant DHN family are characterized by the
presence of two PROSITE signature patterns: the S-segment S(5)-[DE]-x-[DE]-G-x(1,2)-G-x(0,1)-[KR](4) (with
the exception of pea dehydrins, Arabidopsis thaliana
COR47 and XERO2 and wheat cold-shock proteins) and
the K-segment [KR]-[LIM]-K-[DE]-K-[LIM]-P-G. These
common signature patterns are not present in the fungal
sequences. However, another new repeated conserved signature pattern (CSP) was identified in sequences from filamentous fungi: [GRK]-[PV]-H-x-[ST]-x-x-x-N-[nonpolar
amino acid]-[nonpolar amino acid]-D-P-[RTP]-V-D-[SN].
This deduced signature pattern identified at the C-terminal represents the first block of amino acids aligned by TCoffee [25] and it is repeated from one to nine times
within each sequence with slight variations (Fig. 2). The
different number of repetitions of the CSP poses a challenging problem to the alignment of these regions, but TCoffee aligned all the first and the last repetitions
together, because further conserved residues flank these
two repetitions. Not only TbDHN1 and the analysed fungal proteins, but all the previously cited fungal and plant
sequences retrieved from blast searches show this CSP. It
has to be underlined that sequences from C. albicans do
not show this CSP but, in any case, they do share common
physicochemical features with the other fungal sequences
(Table 2).

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/39

and fungal Class III proteins (Table 3) generated by T-coffee was used to infer the phylogenetic relationship. NJ
(data not shown) and Bayesian posterior probability analyses (Fig. 3) showed a congruent tree topology. Bayesian
analyses yielded a phylogenetic tree in which clades corresponding to LEA Class I, Class II, Class III proteins are recognizable, although the LEA Class III sequence group is
not well defined. A first clade, supported by a posterior
probability value of 0.74, comprises all LEA Class I proteins and a Class III protein from P. sativum. A second
clade, supported by a posterior probability value of 0.63,
includes all LEA 2 proteins from plant, TbDHN1 and its
fungal homologs. Fungal LEA Class II proteins clustered
together with a posterior probability value of 0.78 and
61% NJ bootstrap value. Despite the lack of CSP, also C.
albicans proteins are included in the same cluster. Notably, Swiss-Prot:Q9ZTR5_HORVU, the best hit of known
function provided by blastx searches, falls in this clade.
Plant and fungal Class III proteins clustered together but
did not form a well separated clade supported by posterior
probability and MP bootstrap values higher than 50%.
A multiple alignment among TbDHN1 and its fungal
homologs were generated with T-coffee and used to build
a Hidden Markov Model profile. This was used to query
Swiss-Prot and Pfam databases, but no hit with a significant score was retrieved: the first hit was an Ice nucleation
protein (Swiss-Prot:P09815), E-value = 0.076, from Pseudomonas fluorescens.
WoLF PSORTII predicted for TbDHN1 and the other
twelve fungal proteins a probable nuclear/cytoplasmic
localization, but no nuclear localization signals were
found by PredictNLS program.

As in plant DHNs, in TbDHN1, GenBank:EAA55454 from
M. grisea, GenBank:EAA70367 from G. zeae, SNU00161
from S. nodorum, GenBank:CAD70810 from N. crassa and
both proteins from C. albicans, there are repetitions of
amino acid strings which are identical within the same
sequence but different from one sequence to the other
(data not shown).

The case study of TbDHN1: gene structure
The entire sequence of TbDHN1 gene was obtained from
a T. borchii cDNA and genomic library screening. TbDHN1
mRNA was a 2300-bp-long open reading frame coding for
a predicted 351 amino acid long polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 34,8 kDa. The genomic
sequence revealed the presence of a 79-bp-long intron
after 178 nucleotides from the translation initiator ATG
and a putative TATA-box located at position -35 nt from
the transcription start site (Fig. 4). Besides the presence of
4 repetitions of the CSP, another peculiar feature has to be
pointed out: a block of 46 amino acids is repeated within
the sequence, separated only by a glutamic acid residue.
The corresponding nucleotide sequences are almost identical with slight variations only in the third nucleotide of
some codons (Fig. 4).

Figure 2
Distribution of the conserved signature pattern (CSP) within TbDHN1 and its homolog sequences
Distribution of the conserved signature pattern (CSP) within TbDHN1 and its homolog sequences. CSP is indicated with red boxes.

Figure 5A, a single-band pattern was produced by hybridization of the TbDHN1 probe to genomic DNA digested
with HindIII and SmaI and a double-band was produced
by KpnI, thus indicating that TbDHN1 is encoded by a single copy gene in T. borchii genome.
Stress-regulated expression of TbDHN1
Previous experiments showed that TbDHN1 transcript
was strongly upregulated in T. borchii fruiting bodies compared to vegetative mycelium grown on control medium
[21], but, since fruit bodies can be collected only in field,
we chose to further investigate TbDHN1 expression using
vegetative mycelium grown in axenic conditions.

RNA gel-blot experiments were conducted to determine
whether TbDHN1 transcription levels increase in the same
conditions affecting plant DHNs transcription, e.g. low
temperature stress and salinity stress. The RNA gel-blot
data reported in Figure 5B showed that the TbDHN1 messenger increased immediately following transfer on NaCl
medium for 30 min and such up-regulation is still evident
in a NaCl treatment prolonged to 24 h. The same strong

up-regulation response is also evident after a 48 h-long
cold treatment. TbDHN1 messenger rapidly returned to
basal levels when mycelia cultivated for 24 h on NaCl
medium were shifted for 5 h on control medium, while in
mycelia continually cultivated for 29 h on NaCl medium
the up-regulation was still evident.

Discussion
Almost 40 genomes of fungi have been completely
sequenced or are currently in the pipeline according to the
NCBI website. In any newly sequenced eukaryotic
genome, more than 30–40% of the genes usually do not
have an assigned function [26]. Remarkably, a relatively
small fraction of the uncharacterized genes is species- or
genus-specific; the majority of such "hypothetical" genes
have a wider phyletic distribution and therefore are usually referred to as "conserved hypothetical" genes [27,28].
Although it appears that the central pathways of information processing and metabolism are already known,
important signalling and stress response mechanisms
remain to be studied [29].

is DHN6 from Hordeum vulgare (corresponding to GenBank:
AAD02257) which represents the first hit of known biological role
found by blastx using TbDHN1 as query sequence.

In our previous work on key regulators and master genes
controlling the morphogenetic events of truffle fruiting
body formation, 16 out of the 55 transcripts preferentially
expressed in fruit bodies showed significant homology to
other fungal hypothetical proteins of unknown function
[21]. The availability of experimental data on the upregulation of TbDHN1 (M6G10 EST) in T. borchii reproductive
stage, the presence of TbDHN1 homologs in other ascomycetous fungi and the absence in other fungal lineages
(especially in Basidiomycota and Glomeromycota) made
this gene a priority target for investigations on ascomycetous fruiting body formation. Conserved genes having a
patchy phyletic distribution could be functional determinants of particular phenotypes and let us hypothesize that
this DHN-like gene may have been acquired by some
organisms after the separation of the main fungal evolutionary lineages which was estimated at 1400 Myr [30].
On the other hand, TbDHN1 and its homologs are supposed to be a part of the larger family of LEA proteins, so
we can assess that this protein family has a nearly ubiquitous phyletic distribution: they were already found in
plants, algae, invertebrates, bacteria and in ascomycetous
fungi. Significant positive correlation between the
phyletic spread of a gene and the likelihood that it is
essential for cell growth has been demonstrated [31].
Since LEA proteins belonging to different classes have no
evident sequence similarity but only common structural
and physicochemical characteristics, the hypothesis of an
independent evolution in different organisms under
dehydration conditions is more likely than the hypothesis
that they share a common ancestor [13]. Defence against
water deficit caused by low temperature, salinity stress or
drought is, in fact, a crucial point in preventing cell damage, especially for those organisms, like plants and microrganisms, that are unable to escape from critical
environmental conditions.
Another point of interest raised by TbDHN1 and its
homologs bears upon the presence of a repeated conserved signature pattern (CSP) which groups together all
the sequences found in filamentous fungi and plants. We
supposed that the two proteins from C. albicans do not
show this CSP because they are from a lievitoid Ascomycete, but we do not exclude that they could share a not-yet
identified CSP with other Saccharomycetales.
The different number of repetitions of the common signature pattern in various organisms could be explained as a
possible consequence of multiple events of internal duplication. Repetitions of the CSP within the same sequence
are not exactly identical; therefore, after an initial event of
internal duplication, a differentiation of the CSP may
have occurred. The fungal CSP, as well as other repeated
modules of proteins [32], could be a structural/functional
domain.

stress responses and vegetative desiccation tolerance. The
second sequence was isolated from an O. sativa cDNA
library constructed from drought stress panicle. Therefore,
the presence of the new CSP in these transcripts suggests
that it is associated with transcripts involved in responses
to cellular dehydration.
Why consider TbDHN1 and its homologs as DHN-like
proteins?
In silico and experimental analyses suggest that TbDHN1
and its homologs should be classified as dehydrins. There
is much evidence to support this claim. Firstly, all the protein sequences shared the typical physiochemical properties of the large family of LEA proteins. More precisely,
they fitted the set of rules defined by Wise to define Class
II, the group of all plant dehydrins, although Wise trained
his application with plant proteins exclusively. Class II of
plant LEA proteins is also characterized by the presence of
two conserved signature patterns. TbDHN1 and its
homologs do not have any of the already identified conserved signature patterns, but those proteins from filamentous fungi and plants show a new, previously
uncharacterized CSP. This pattern is variously repeated in
the fungal sequences: from the single repetition in N.
crassa Q7S6B0 to the nine repetitions in A. nidulans GenBank:EAA62484 and A. fumigatus GenBank:EAL89059.
Except for the border-line case of N. crassa Q7S6B0, the
last repetition of CSP at the C-terminal of all the
sequences is the most conserved one. The absence of the
conserved signature patterns typical of plant dehydrins is
not sufficient to exclude a protein from Class II of LEA
proteins; in fact Wise includes Swiss-Prot:O22623 from
Vaccinium corymbosum in Class II, although the sequence
lacks both conserved signature patterns.

The presence of the newly identified CSP in the ESTs
CN2013881 from T. ruralis and CA765427 from O. sativa
is very intriguing. The first sequence was in fact isolated
during a study on the rehydration transcriptome of T.
ruralis [33], an important plant model for studying plant

All this evidence is further supported by the phylogenetic
inference: the tree topology shows how TbDHN1 and its
fungal homologs cluster together with LEA Class II proteins. C. albicans proteins too fall in the same clade,
although they lack the fungal CSP.
We can thus determine that TbDHN1 and its homologs
are dehydrin-like proteins. EAK94850 (NCBI Protein
Database Accession Number) and EAK94909 (NCBI Protein Database Accession Number) from C. albicans were
already recorded in the protein database at NCBI as
"dehydrins", but exclusively on the basis of their homology with DHN6 from H. vulgare, the same protein which
represents the best hit of the known biological role for
TbDHN1. Here, our physiochemical and structural analyses provide further substantial elements to their assignment as dehydrins.

24 h; Lane 3); treated for 48 h at 4°C (cold shock 48 h; Lane 4). Repression (right): mRNA extracted from mycelia grown for
30 days on CM (CM; Lane 1), treated for 29 h in NaCl 0.4 M (NaCl 29 h; Lane 2); treated for 24 h in NaCl 0.4 M and then
transferred on CM for 5 h (NaCl 24 h→ CM 5h; Lane 3). Signals obtained by 32P -labeled TbDHN1 probe (top) were normalized using the rRNA 28 S probe as internal standard (bottom).

TbDHN1 gene structure and expression pattern
In silico analyses on fungal dehydrin-like proteins were
followed by an extensive study on TbDHN1 gene structure
and expression pattern in stress vs. control conditions.
Southern blot analysis showed that TbDHN1 is a single
copy gene but, in the absence of complete T. borchii
genome sequence data, we cannot exclude the presence of
other DHN-like coding genes in T. borchii. Since a number
of DHN-like genes from the same genome (e.g. N. crassa,
M. grisea, C. albicans and A. fumigatus) are very different in
nucleotide sequence, the TbDHN1 probe could be
expected to fail to match other DHN-like genes. The presence of multiple DHN-like proteins in a single proteome
leads to the hypothesis that they represent a multigenic
family; in fact, concerning A. fumigatus genome, the three
identified DHN-like proteins are localized on three different chromosomes: EAL89059 on chromosome 6,
EAL84332 (NCBI Protein Database Accession Number)
on chromosome 4 and EAL87020 on chromosome 7.

RNA gel-blot experiments determined that TbDHN1 transcription levels increase in the same conditions affecting
plant DHNs transcription, e.g. low temperature stress and
salinity stress. This strong upregulatory response is fully

reversible, since basal levels of the TbDHN1 transcript
were recovered following additional five-hour incubation
on control medium.
The upregulation of M6G10 EST in fruiting body compared to vegetative mycelium [21] is probably strictly
linked to the exposure of fruiting bodies to low temperatures during the autumn/winter season. T. borchii
ascomata develop from November to April and the best
harvests generally result from a period of poor growing
conditions, such as drought and low temperature, immediately followed by optimal conditions of warmth and
moisture [34]. Fruiting bodies analyzed in our previous
work were in fact sampled in a natural truffle ground near
Alba in Piedmont (Italy) during the December 1999 –
March 2000 and December 2000 – March 2001 production seasons, when the average registered temperatures
were 5.7°C and 6.3°C, respectively. This may explain why
M6G10 EST was the most expressed transcript in fruiting
bodies compared to vegetative mycelium grown at 24°C.
The high up-regulation of TbDHN1 transcript in waterlimiting conditions could represent one of the molecular
mechanisms to face the threat of desiccation. Many other
genes encoding for stress proteins were up-regulated dur-

ing the reproductive stage [21], including a putative hsp12
[GenBank:CN488002] which shares 31% identity with
hsp12 from S. cerevisiae. The latter is also supposed to be
a LEA-like protein because it is highly expressed when
there is an increased osmolality within the cell, such as
during spore maturation [14]. It thus seems that in T.
borchii there is a molecular mechanism involving a set of
genes specifically induced in response to cellular dehydration resulting from developmental events like fruiting
body formation/maturation or environmental stimuli
such as osmotic stress and low temperature. Although a
transient transformation of T. borchii mycelium has
already been obtained [35], stable transformants cannot
be exploited to provide a direct functional evidence to
support this hypothesis.

Conclusion
Expression pattern and sequence similarities to known
plant DHNs indicate that TbDHN1 is the first characterized DHN-like protein in fungi. The high similarity of
TbDHN1 with homolog coding sequences implies the
existence of a novel fungal/plant group of LEA Class II
proteins. Since most of the DHNs reported so far are from
plants, it is not surprising that TbDHN1 displays a conserved repeated signature pattern that distinguishes it
from other DHNs. This new signature pattern will be proposed to Prosite as the main feature of this new DHN-like
group of proteins and all the new dehydrins could be
grouped in the ProDom uncharacterized protein family
PD844692, which was so far populated only by the
sequence CAD70810 from N. crassa.
Another remarkable feature of these DHN-like proteins is
their peculiar distribution. In fact, even though complete
(or almost complete) genomes and EST collections of
some Basidiomycota, Glomeromycota and Viridiplantae
are already available, they appear to be represented only
in Ascomycota and in a limited number of plant families.
In any case it is possible that other homologs of TbDHN1
will be soon identified in other fungi or plants that have
only partial genome coverage.
This is not the first time that a new protein has been characterized using bioinformatic and biological investigation
of genes/peptides isolated from T. borchii. TbSP1 identified a novel family of fungal/bacterial PLA2s [36] and,
more recently, a T. borchii EST was characterized as the first
member of the new family of Cyanovirin-N Homology
[37]. Taken on the whole, these data suggest that the T.
borchii genome is a potential goldmine of uncharacterized
genes for understanding new aspects of microbial biology.

Methods
Sequence isolation
The 771-bp-long M6G10 EST was isolated from an expression library constructed from a mature fruiting body
(CF70) of Tuber borchii [21]. cDNA array hybridizations
showed that this clone was the highest upregulated gene
(163.7-fold) between the reproductive and vegetative
stage.

Two
specific
oligonucleotides
(DHNf:
5'GGTACTCGCGAAACACACTCTG-3');
DHNr:
5'TGGCCTTCTAGAATTAACTCG-3') were used as PCR
primers to amplify the corresponding region on M6G10
EST. PCR reaction was performed in a 30 μl volume reaction which consists of 80 μM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 50 pmol of each primer, 1 U of REDTaq DNA
polymerase (Sigma), and the buffer supplied by the manufacturer of the REDTaq DNA polymerase. The PCR
parameters were as follows: 94°C for 3 min; 94°C for 45
sec, 60°C for 45 sec, and 72°C for 1 min for 35 cycles; and
a final cycle at 72°C for 10 min. The resulting DNA fragment was purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit
(Qiagen) and utilized as a probe for plaque hybridization
analysis of two T. borchii libraries: a cDNA library of vegetative mycelium grown for 30 days on MMN liquid
medium, constructed in the phage vector Uni-Zap XR, and
a DNA library constructed in the phage vector EMBL4
(kindly provided by B. Lazzari and A. Viotti, Istituto Biosintesi Vegetali, CNR, Milano). Phage DNA extracted from
hybridization-positive plaques of both screenings was
sequenced by Genome Express (Meylan – France). The
full-length cDNA and the corresponding genomic
sequence were thus obtained and deposited to GenBank
database [GenBank:DQ308610]. Hereafter we refer to
M6G10 complete genomic and mRNA sequence as
TbDHN1.
Homology search
Initial homology searches were conducted with M6G10
sequence against the non-redundant (nr) protein
sequence and the Swiss-Prot databases at the NCBI by
using blastx program [38]. To identify homologs within
Expressed Sequence Tags collections, blastn and tblastn
searches were run against the EST database at NCBI and
the fungal plant pathogen database [39].

Genome and protein sequences (2005-06-31 release)
from fungi and plants available at NCBI, the Broad Institute [40] and TIGR [41] were downloaded to a local database and formatted to be used with a local BLAST
installation. The complete nucleotide sequence of
TbDHN1 was used to query public databases using blastx
and blastp programs. All blast results were loaded into a
MySQL [42] database for further analyses and data mining.

On the basis of sequence similarities, other twelve, previously uncharacterised, fungal TbDHN1 homologs were
identified (Table 1). All twelve fungal proteins derived
from a conceptual translation of their genome. The following in silico analyses were performed on TbDHN1 and
these twelve fungal hypothetical proteins.
Secondary and tertiary structure predictions
Secondary structure percentage composition was
obtained by a four-state prediction for each amino acid
using PHDsec from ProteinPredict server [43]. The fourstate predictions were converted to percentage composition values in order to minimize the effects due to differences in length across the sequences as suggested by Wise
[12].

The program T-Coffee [25] was used to build a multiple
alignment with TbDHN1 and the hits obtained by homology searches (Table 1). The alignment was slightly manually optimized with GeneDoc [44]. Based on the
multiple fungal alignment, a profile hidden Markov
model (HMM) was built using HMMER [45] in order to
search Swiss-Prot and Pfam for a sequence family's consensus.
Phylogenetic analysis
T-Coffee was used to build a multiple alignment among
the TbDHN1 fungal homologs, plant LEA proteins
recently classified by Wise [12] in Class I, Class II and
Class III and fungal sequences previously reported as LEA
proteins by Pfam database (Pfam Database Accession
Number PF02987) (Table 3). Among all plant LEAs,
twelve proteins were chosen from each LEA class to represent the highest number of different plant species. Only
LEA Class I, II and III were considered because they are the
only three groups in which conserved consensus sequence
motifs were identified. The alignment was slightly manually optimized with GeneDoc.

The Neighbour-joining (NJ) was performed using PAUP*
4.0b10 [46]. Robustness of the internal branches was
assayed by bootstrap analysis (1000 runs). Bayesian inference based upon posterior probability distribution of
trees was performed with MrBayes [47] with the following
settings: seed and swapseed = 1, generations = 1,000,000,
runs = 2, chains = 4, sampling every 100th generation,
starting trees = random, other settings = default. Phylogenetic trees were rendered with TreeViewX [48].
Amino acid composition
The EMBOSS application Pepinfo [49] was used to calculate amino acid class (Aliphatic, Aromatic, Non-polar,
Polar, Charged, Basic and Acidic) percentage compositions and hydrophobicity values based on the method of
Kyte and Doolittle. As regards the determination of hydro-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/39

phobicity, a 21 aa window was used as suggested by Wise
[12]. Three values were considered for each sequence: the
minimum, the maximum and the average hydrophobicity; negative hydrophobicity values indicate hydrophilicity.
Subcellular localization prediction
Subcellular protein localization and cleavage sites predictions were made with the WoLF PSORTII web server [50]
selecting "fungi" as organism type; nuclear localization
signals were predicted with the PredictNLS program [51].
Expression and DNA analyses
Expression studies were performed to characterize only
TbDHN1 gene. T. borchii Vittad. mycelia (isolate ATCC
95640) were grown in the dark at 24°C on a synthetic
solid medium (control medium, CM) containing CaCl2·
2H2O (66 mg/L), NaCl (25 mg/L), KH2PO4 (500 mg/L),
(NH4)2HPO4 (250 mg/L), MgSO4· 7H2O (150 mg/L),
FeNa-EDTA (20 mg/L), and thiamine hydrochloride (1
mg/L), plus agar (15 g/L) and glucose (5 g/L). To allow
easy medium replacement, myceliar cultures were grown
on semipermeable cellophane membranes. To determine
whether TbDHN1 transcription levels increase in the same
conditions affecting plant dehydrin transcription, mycelia
were first cultured on control medium at 24°C and then
transferred to either a single component-changed media
at 24°C in which NaCl was 1000-fold more concentrated
than in CM (hereafter designated as NaCl treatment) or to
the same control medium at 4°C (hereafter designated as
cold shock treatment). NaCl treatments were performed
using three periods of exposure to high salt concentration:
30 min, 24 h and 29 h. On the other hand, the cold shock
treatment consisted of a 48 h-cold exposure. For "switchoff" experiments, 24 h-NaCl treated mycelia were
returned for 5 h to control medium (hereafter designated
as NaCl→CM). All treated and untreated mycelia were
harvested after 30-days' growth.

Total RNA for Northern Blot analysis was extracted with a
LiCl method [52] from T. borchii mycelia grown for: a) 30
min, 24 h and 29 h or under of NaCl treatment; b) 48 h
of cold treatment; c) 5 h on CM after 24 h of NaCl treatment and d) 30 days at 24°C on CM.
Heat-denatured total RNAs (10 μg for each sample) were
fractionated on 1.8% formaldehyde-agarose gels and
transferred onto a Hybond membrane (Amersham) by
capillary elution. A TbDHN1 cDNA probe was obtained
by PCR amplification on M6G10 EST as previously
described and hybridized to RNA blots containing sizefractionated RNA.
The random-priming labelling of 30 ng DNA probe was
carried out in the presence of [32P]dCTP. Stringent washes

were performed at 65°C with 0.5X SSC and 0.1% (w/v)
SDS. Each filter was then de-hybridized and probed with
T. borchii 28S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) to estimate the level
of total RNA loaded in each lane. Dried filters were
exposed to the phosphor screen for 24 hours. Signals were
quantified with a Personal Imager FX using Quantity One
(Version 4.5.0) software (Biorad). Normalization for differences in loading, labelling and hybridisation were
made based on the 28S ribosomal signal. Normalized signals of all treatments were compared with the control signals. Expression data are representative of three
independent experiments.
Genomic DNA samples for gel blot analysis (10 μg each)
were obtained from mycelia, according to Henrion et al.
[53], digested with HindIII, KpnI and SmaI and size fractionated on a 0.8% agarose gel. A chemiluminescent
labelling kit (ECL direct nucleic acids labelling and detection system, Amersham) was used for labelling TbDHN1
genomic probe; blotting onto Hybond-N (Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech), pre-hybridization, hybridisation and
stringent washing were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.
