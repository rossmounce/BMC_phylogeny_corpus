Abstract
Background: The Programmed Ribosomal Frameshift Database (PRFdb) provides an interface to
help researchers identify potential programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) signals in
eukaryotic genes or sequences of interest.
Results: To identify putative -1 PRF signals, sequences are first imported from whole genomes or
datasets, e.g. the yeast genome project and mammalian gene collection. They are then filtered
through multiple algorithms to identify potential -1 PRF signals as defined by a heptameric slippery
site followed by an mRNA pseudoknot. The significance of each candidate -1 PRF signal is evaluated
by comparing the predicted thermodynamic stability (ΔG°) of the native mRNA sequence against
a distribution of ΔG° values of a pool of randomized sequences derived from the original. The data
have been compiled in a user-friendly, easily searchable relational database.
Conclusion: The PRFdB enables members of the research community to determine whether
genes that they are investigating contain potential -1 PRF signals, and can be used as a metasource
of information for cross referencing with other databases. It is available on the web at http://
dinmanlab.umd.edu/prfdb.

Background
Canonical decoding of the genetic code requires translating ribosomes to convert triplets of bases (codons) into
amino acid sequences. Although this is algorithm is
employed for translation of the vast majority of mRNA
sequences, in some special cases cis-acting mRNA elements direct ribosomes into alternative reading frames,
dynamically "recoding" their sequence information
(reviewed in [1]). Programmed -1 Ribosomal Frameshifting (-1 PRF) was first discovered in RNA viruses where it

enables viral genomes to encode multiple peptides from a
single mRNA [2]. An individual -1 PRF signal consists of a
heptameric 'slippery site' usually followed by an mRNA
pseudoknot secondary structure separated by a suitable
spacer region (reviewed in [3-5]). Unlike their viral counterparts, eukaryotic genome-encoded -1 PRF signals are
predicted to direct elongating ribosomes into premature
termination codons (reviewed in [6]). Such events have
been shown to initiate rapid mRNA degradation in yeast
through the Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD) pathway

[7]. As such, -1 PRF is hypothesized to add a novel modality for regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.
There are currently three databases serving the translational recoding community. RECODE (please see Availability and requirements for more information) is a
browsable collection of all the published translational
recoding signals [8,9]. RECODE's strength is as central
repository of all empirically proven translational recoding
signals. FSDB (please see Availability and requirements
for more information) contains a compilation of a handful of known and predicted viral, prokaryotic and eukaryotic -1 and +1 PRF signals, and also allows users to input
their own sequences to search for frameshift signals using
a program called FSFinder [10]. Although incomplete, this
site provides tools not available through RECODE, in particular it integration of PseudoViewer, a powerful graphics
tool that simplifies visualization of H-type pseudoknots
[11]. MLOGD (please see Availability and requirements
for more information) is a suite of software that allows
detection of new protein-coding sequences by identifying
overlapping open reading frames [12]. While all three of
these sites have their strengths, a common weakness it
that they do not provide well catalogued, searchable databases of all potential recoding signals of any one kind. To
fill this gap, we have created PRFdb as a database of predicted -1 PRF signals in eukaryotic genomes. The methods
used to search for predicted -1 PRF signals have been previously described, and importantly, we have empirically
demonstrated that a significant number of -1 PRF signals
so identified actually promote significant levels of
frameshifting [13]. The strength of the PRFdb is that it
provides a tool for researchers outside of the translational
recoding field to use to quickly search for and identify
potential -1 PRF signals in genes in which they are interested.

Construction and content
In the PRFdb, the predicted -1 PRF signals are represented
by: 1) the genes in which they reside; 2) the identity and
location of their slippery sites; 3) graphical representations of their predicted secondary structures; 4) computationally identified minimum free energies (MFE); and 5)
the thermodynamic significance of these mRNA structures
as compared to randomized variants. Currently completed genomes in the PRFdb are Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(88,683 sequences windows from 4,238 of 6,352 genes);
Homo sapiens (24,104 sequence windows from 6826 of
17,891 genes); Mus musculus (19,313 windows from
6,053 of 15,620 genes); Rattus norvegicus (5924 sequence
windows comprising 1982 of 5341 genes); Bos Taurus
(10,690 windows from comprising 3349 of 9187 genes);
Danio rerio (7640 sequence windows comprising 2618 of
6197 genes); and Xenopus tropicalis (9776 sequence win-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/9/339

dows comprising 2712 of 5126 genes). As of this writing,
sequences from Xenopus laevis are being evaluated and
entered into the database. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome
is queued next in the pipeline.
Researchers can access data in the PRFdb through four
means: (i) Search (Figure 1) provides a way to query a
gene of interest using the specific gene name or description from the yeast genome project or mammalian gene
collection. The search interface also provides a means to
use BLAST to search for genes in the PRFdb similar to a
query sequence. ii) Distribution (Figure 2) enables browsing for sequences containing statistically significant putative -1 PRF signals through a graphical representation of
computed minimum free energies with respect to randomized z scores for all sequence windows. It is also possible to limit this distribution to sequences that are
preceded by a specific slippery site. iii) Filter prints
sequences from a given genome that meet specific criteria
including: species, pseudoknotted sequence, sequences
with a specific number of base pairs and/or MFE. iv)
Download provides a format suitable for parsing all
sequences of a given genome/sequence dataset.
The search, distribution, and filter interfaces lead to a
detailed description of individual putative PRF signals
(Figure 3). This provides a summary of all data gathered
for a given sequence including: background information
on the gene and location of the -1 PRF signal, information
regarding the program used to perform the MFE prediction, multiple methods to view the secondary structure,
and a comparison of the distribution of randomized
sequences to the MFE of the folded sequence.
If a sequence of interest is not currently in the PRFdb, it
can be imported via its NCBI accession number.
Sequences added in this manner will be filtered within
hours of import. Sequences imported into the PRFdb are
also folded using sequential windows across the entire
sequence in order to create a graphical minimum free
energy 'landscape.' This enables users to submit longer or
shorter sequence strings for computational folding, a particularly useful feature e.g. for eliminating extraneous
sequence that may not be involved in actual RNA folding.
For example, the computational analysis of the 100 nucleotide sequence downstream of the slippery site of the
mouse Ma3 -1 PRF signal provided by the PRFdb predicts
tandem stem loop structures. However, when only 55 nt
of downstream sequence are provided, PRFdB predicts the
empirically documented pseudoknot structure [14].
Sequences to be analyzed by the PRFdb are imported into
the database, filtered using RNAMotif [15], folded with
secondary structure prediction algorithms, randomized
using one or more randomization methods, and refolded.

The detailed interface
The detailed interface. This demonstrates that pknots was used to compute an MFE of -23.7 kcal/mol for the 100 bases following the AAAAAU slippery site at position 1653 of the EST2 gene. When randomized 100 times using Fisher-Yates shuffling,
a mean MFE of -17.4 kcal/mol was computed for a normal distribution of correlation coefficient 0.9627. The MFE distribution
of the randomized sequences is on the right; with the idealized normal distribution in red. The black vertical line marks the
mean MFE of the randomized sequences, and the green vertical line marks the MFE of the native sequence. This secondary
structure is significantly more stable than random (z score = -2.10). The predicted mRNA secondary structure of this
sequence is shown below using both bracket notation, and using a Feynman diagram.

To avoid complications of untranslated intronic
sequences, the PRFdb contains only mature mRNA
sequences (cDNA sequences primarily).
Sequences are imported into the PRFdb from a web interface using Genbank accession numbers, yeast genome
accessions, or raw sequences. Each new sequence is first
passed through a simple text filter that searches for slippery sites following the International Union of Pure and
Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) pattern 'N NNW WWH' (or X
XXY YYZ), where N (X) denotes any three identical bases,
W (Y) denotes AAA or UUU, H (Z) ≠ G, and spaces indicate the incoming (zero) reading frame. Since the distance
between the end of the slippery site and the downstream
stimulatory sequence is important, a spacer of 1 to 8 nt
was incorporated into the algorithm. Downstream
sequences (100, 75 and 50 nt) are passed to RNAMotif
with a descriptor looking for the potential to form an
mRNA pseudoknot. Sequence windows passing this min-

imal test are passed to multiple pseudoknot predicting
mRNA secondary structure prediction algorithms, including Pknots [16], Nupack [17], and HotKnots [18]. Mfold [19]
and the Iterative Loop Matching algorithm are not used
because Mfold does not predict pseudoknots and ILM does
not provide the minimum free energy values for predicted
secondary structures. After folding, every sequence is randomized using one or more algorithms including: FisherYates shuffling to maintain dinucleotide frequencies,
codon frequencies, or nucleotide frequencies. The resulting random sequence windows are then refolded without
searching for pseudoknots. This process is repeated a fixed
number of times (100 by default) to create a distribution
of sequence specific randomized MFEs. These resulting
distribution of randomized MFEs is then compared the
MFE of the original sequence window. These values are
used to compute a z score, thus providing a measurement
of the significance of the native sequence.

Utility

Availability and requirements

As with most bioinformatics projects, the generation of
the PRFdB engenders more questions than answers. Most
importantly, why is this database of useful to anyone outside of the frameshifting community? The response is that
-1 PRF represents fundamental mechanism for the regulation of gene expression at post-transcriptional gene with
far-reaching and broad impact. Thus, the PRFdB represents a resource that is useful and available to any
researcher interested in how their gene or pathway of
interest might be regulated at this level. Here, we have
sought to simplify such inquiries by constructing a userfriendly web-based interface. The other major question
concerns what the user might do following identification
of a potential -1 PRF signal in a gene of interest. The classical "bench-based" approach that we are currently following is to clone the element into reporters and
quantitatively determine whether it actually promotes -1
PRF (we typically use a cutoff level of ≥ 0.5% of a
readthrough control), and whether it can function as an
mRNA destabilizing element. Computational followup
strategies include cross database referencing (e.g. assessing how -1 PRF in an mRNA or set of mRNAs might affect
the transcriptome as monitored by microarray analysis),
and phylogenetic analyses. In sum, the PRFdB provides
yet another set of information for deep, one gene at a time
mining, as well as for the broader approaches typified by
the rapidly developing field of systematic biology.

The PRFdb is freely available on the web at http://dinman
lab.umd.edu/prfdb and can be accessed though any
standard web browser. Access and data downloading
require no special requirements.

Discussion and conclusion
With regard to future development, the PRFdb is currently
processing the Xenopus laevis genome. The Arabidopsis thaliana and Caenorabditis elegans genomes are currently in the
queue, and additional genomes will be processed in the
near future. In addition, the BLAST interface to the PRFdb
has been used to discover Genbank sequences similar to
the most statistically significant sequences in the database, thus providing a means to expand the PRFdb in a
depth first manner. As more similar sequences are completed, comparative genomics studies using sequence
and/or mRNA structure alignments will be incorporated
to enable identification of conserved -1 PRF signals across
species and/or genes. As time progresses, additional computational and empirical information will allow for
improved scoring, helping to increase the statistical relevance of the predicted secondary mRNA structures. These
improvements will continue to make the PRFdb more
useful and accessible to the research community, providing a resource allowing individual users to identify -1 PRF
signals in genes of interest, and as a metasource of information for cross referencing with other databases, e.g.
genomes and DNA microarray databases.
