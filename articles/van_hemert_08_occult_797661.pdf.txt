Abstract
Background: Occult or latent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is defined as infection with
detectable HBV DNA and undetectable surface antigen (HBsAg) in patients' blood. The cause of an
overt HBV infection becoming an occult one is unknown. To gain insight into the mechanism of the
development of occult infection, we compared the full-length HBV genome from a blood donor
carrying an occult infection (d4) with global genotype D genomes.
Results: The phylogenetic analysis of polymerase, core and X protein sequences did not
distinguish d4 from other genotype D strains. Yet, d4 surface protein formed the evolutionary
outgroup relative to all other genotype D strains. Its evolutionary branch was the only one where
accumulation of substitutions suggests positive selection (dN/dS = 1.3787). Many of these
substitutiions accumulated specifically in regions encoding the core/surface protein interface, as
revealed in a 3D-modeled protein complex. We identified a novel RNA splicing event (deleting
nucleotides 2986-202) that abolishes surface protein gene expression without affecting polymerase,
core and X-protein related functions. Genotype D strains differ in their ability to perform this
2986-202 splicing. Strains prone to 2986-202 splicing constitute a separate clade in a phylogenetic
tree of genotype D HBVs. A single substitution (G173T) that is associated with clade membership
alters the local RNA secondary structure and is proposed to affect splicing efficiency at the 202
acceptor site.
Conclusion: We propose an evolutionary scenario for occult HBV infection, in which 2986-202
splicing generates intracellular virus particles devoid of surface protein, which subsequently
accumulates mutations due to relaxation of coding constraints. Such viruses are deficient of
autonomous propagation and cannot leave the host cell until it is lysed.

Background
Occult HBV infections are defined as the presence of HBV
DNA and the absence of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg

encoded by the S gene) in plasma or serum of HBVinfected patients [1]. This infection may persist in individuals for years without emerging symptoms of overt HBV

infection. Co-infection [2], drug abuse [3] or immunosuppression [4] can trigger an enhancement of HBV DNA
levels without an increase of HBsAg. Transmission of HBV
from individuals with occult HBV infection may occur via
organ transplantation or blood transfusion [5]. It is presently unclear to what extent occult HBV infection represents a risk factor for the community other than for the
infected individual [6].
In HBV sequences obtained from serum samples of HBsAg
seronegative carriers, a plethora of mutations has been
observed [7-10]. Point mutations, deletions and splicing
alternatives have been associated with occult HBV, but it
is unclear whether these mutations are a cause or a consequence of an occult HBV infection. Many of these occult
infection associated mutations reside in the S gene and/or
regions governing the regulation of S gene expression, but
they have also been documented for the core (C) and
polymerase (P) genes.
Replication-defective mutants of HBV have been detected
in the circulation of symptom-free individuals as early as
1987, and a notable example showed a deletion in to the
pre-S region [11], which mediates cellular receptor binding [12]. Subsequently, splicing of viral RNA has been
identified as a major cause of HBV genome and particle
heterogeneity [13-16]. Spliced viral mRNA may become
translated into aberrant HBV proteins with unknown
function [17]. The existence of a potential splice site does
not necessarily mean that it is constitutively used. A region
called PRE (Posttranscriptional Regulatory Element) has
been identified in the HBV genome. The PRE facilitates
the export of PRE-containing transcripts from the nucleus
to the cytoplasm [18-20]. Consequently, viral transcripts
reach the cellular translational machinery along two competing pathways: either being promoted by PRE before
splicing occurs or via the regular export route of spliced
cellular mRNAs. More recently, Hass and coworkers
referred to this competitive feature to demonstrate that
integrity of the 458/459 exon/intron transition is required
for the accumulation of pre-S2/S mRNA ([21] see also editorial). Posttranscriptional reduction of surface protein
and mRNA expression to a background level was due to a
single G458A substitution [21] and could also be caused
by deletion of 30 nucleotides immediately downstream of
this site [22].
Recently, we obtained sequence information for HBV
strains present in occult infections [7]. Based on its analysis, we here propose a novel splicing event of HBV RNA
(deleting the nucleotides from 2986 to 202) that abolishes surface protein expression without affecting other
functions encoded in the virus genome (P, C and X). HBV
strains prone to this splicing opportunity constitute a separate clade in a phylogenetic tree of the genotype D

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/146

polymerase sequences. In this clade, a T-to-G mutation at
position 173 truncates a splice-promoting polypyrimidine tract [23] and also affects the local secondary structure of the viral RNA [24]. As a result, the splicing activity
at the neighboring 202 splice acceptor site may be downregulated. The splicing possibility (2986-202) based on
NetGene2 predictions presently awaits further experimental support by analysis of liver samples, which are much
more complicated to obtain from healthy occult HBV carriers than blood samples.

Results
Mutations in occult EU155893 HBV DNA
HBV surface protein of donor 4 with an occult HBV infection (EU155893, d4) takes the outgroup position in a
bootstrapped phylogenetic tree based on JTT-estimates of
amino acid replacements in genotype D surface proteins
(Fig 1, left panel). The lengths of the branches of the available surface protein sequences from the other donors with
occult HBV infection (1a, 1b, 2, 3, 5a and 5b) were similar
or even larger than the d4 branch length leading to severe
tree compression and were therefore excluded from the
tree. PAML analysis allowing dN/dS values of clades and
branches to exceed the value of 1 generated a dN/dS value
of 1.3787 for the branch of d4 surface protein gene,
almost a fourfold of the average value of 0.3579 ± 0.1831
(range 0.1450–0.7455) of the other clades and branches
(Fig 1, right panel, S). A likelihood ratio comparison with
a similar analysis limiting dN/dS values to maximally 1
provided statistical support (p < 0.001). In the other HBV
genes, the dN/dS values of d4 DNA were close to the average values (Fig 1, right panel, P, C and X) – P: 0.3162 ±
0.0656 (range 0.2102–0.3840), C: 0.2180 ± 0.1733
(range 0.0653–0.5765) and X: 0.5136 ± 0.1490 (range
0.3318–0.7376). These data indicate the presence of positive selection or relaxed selective constraints as a characteristic property of the surface protein gene in this case of
occult infection. During evolution from an overt to the
present occult infection, the surface protein gene of d4
HBV accumulated non-synonymous and synonymous
nucleotide substitutions to approximately equal proportions.

The HBV genome of d4 contains 42 unique nucleotide
substitutions that are not observed in a collection of 89
genotype D HBV species (DQ series [8] were not included,
see below). In control strain AB205128 from a patient
with overt HBV infection, only 16 characteristic mutations
had accumulated in the genome. In order to pinpoint
clusters of d4-specific substitution, we awarded each of
these mutations a value of 1 and plotted the mutational
hits cumulatively along the genome (Fig 2). Steep
increases of the plot indicate regions of enhanced divergence, which is prominent in d4 HBV DNA at the a-determinant region (10/42 substitutions), the oligonucleotide

grey line, occult infection) and in control AB205128 HBV DNA (thick black line, overt infection) are compared with 89 HBV
DNAs of genotype D and plotted cumulatively along the HBV genome. Steep slopes at the a-determinant (1), the oligonucleotide 895–909 (2) and the central part of C (3) indicate the relatively high divergence of these regions in d4 HBV. Thin grey

895–909 (4/42) and the central part of the core protein
(5/42). As far as sequences are available, accumulation of
nucleotide substitutions specifically at the a-determinant
region is also prominent in strains from other donors with
occult HBV infection (Fig 2, thin lines: 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 5a and
5b). Conservation prevails in X protein, the N-terminal
part of S and in the remaining parts of core and polymer-

ase. S1, S2, and C-terminal parts of S display an intermediate degree of variation. In the control strain AB205128,
local accumulation of mutations can hardly be observed
and slopes are similar to those of HBV d4 DNA in the conserved regions. Enhanced mutational rates at sites are usually associated with a relaxation of functional constraints
of the regions involved and may indicate a contribution of

these regions to the evolutionary transition from an overt
into an occult HBV infection. A diminished interaction
between core and surface proteins due to the mutations
introduced at the regions 1 and 3 of HBV d4 DNA (Fig 2)
may provide a substantiation of this process, rendering
the transition irreversible.
We have previously studied the amino acid composition
of interfaces between 3D-structured domains or proteins
of HBV [25] by means of computational alanine replacement scanning [26]. The docking procedure [27] of monomeric HBsAg with tetrameric core protein (PBD entry
1qgt) followed by ALASCAN-directed selection among the
alternative structures resulted in the complex with a yellow-colored interface region as shown in Fig 3. A PDB formatted data file carrying the coordinates of the complex is

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/146

provided online as Additional File 1. The corresponding
output of the ALASCAN server shows that the central part
of core protein (amino acid residues 67–96), the N-terminal half of the a-determinant region (96–122) and the Cterminal part of surface protein (169–195) participate in
the interface between core and surface proteins (Table 1)
in order to promote the formation of an infectious virus
particle. In d4 DNA, these regions display the d4-characteristic feature of enhanced sequence divergence. Not all
of these nucleotide substitutions translate into amino acid
replacements. Replacements typical for d4 HBV are G74V,
I80A and Y100C in core and P111S, T123P, T125I, L175S
and M197T in surface protein, respectively. These results
indicate the evolutionary loss of the ability for S/C interface formation during the development from a "wild
type" genotype D ancestor to the occult d4 phenotype. It

should be kept in mind that gene overlapping constraints
does not preclude the independent evolution of genes in
HBV [28].
Altered RNA splicing in occult d4 HBV
Splicing of HBV RNA is considered not to be essential for
HBV propagation. Intriguingly, an association was
reported between RNA splicing and the generation of replication-defective HBV variants [13-17]. We applied the
NetGene2 prediction server in search of characteristic differences between the patterns of donor and acceptor splice
sites in the HBV genomes of d4 and X02496 as genotype
D reference strain (Table 2). In many aspects (position,
phase and confidence), the splicing possibilities are quite
similar for these strains, except for the presence of an extra
acceptor site at position 202 in the DNA of d4 HBV. Interestingly, a splicing event between the acceptor site 202
and the donor splice site at position 2986 preserves the
original reading frame, but deletes almost the entire
spacer region from the viral polymerase and – in the overlapping S gene – the S-promoter region and the 5'untranslated leader together with 16 N-terminal codons
of preS2/S mRNA (Fig 4, case 1). Consequently, the
polymerase-dependent functions in virus replication (terminal protein – tp, reverse transcriptase – rt and RNAse H
– rh) remain unaffected, while sequences for large, middle

and small surface protein gene expression in the overlapping reading frame are deleted. As a result of this posttranscriptional event, a virus genome may regularly replicate and be encapsidated inside the host cell, but cannot
be enveloped and hence has lost the ability to exit the host
cell and to enter new cells. These molecular properties
match the characteristics of occult HBV infection.
Notably, the splice 2986 to 202 is rather unique in this
virus-inactivation aspect. Other splice opportunities may
not occur due to proximity (459 to 488), may induce a
frame-shift (2986 to 488 or 734) or may affect essential
viral functions (459, 2472 or 2986 to 707–1384). As
shown by zu Putlitz and coworkers [22], deletion of
nucleotides 459–488 (Fig 4, case 2) caused a >99% reduction in the level of preS2/S mRNA without affecting the
transcriptional rate of this mRNA and the replication
competence of the mutant HBV. It may be expected that
every splicing event that induces this deletion (Fig 4, cases
3, 5, 6 and 7) similarly affects surface protein expression.
Also, it should be noted that the deletion spans the amino
acid residues 102–111 in the surface protein frame. This
region constitutes the N-terminal domain of the a-determinant and participates in the interface between core and
surface protein region (previous section, Table 1). Splicing
between 459 and 734 (Fig 4, case 3) also preserves the
original reading frame, but the intron/exon boundary
resides just at the YMDD motif of polymerase yielding an
inactive polymerase. Similarly, splicing between 2472 and
202 (Fig 4, case 4) retains the reading frame, but abolishes
– in addition to the spacer region – a majority of the tp
domain of polymerase.
Splice prediction in human mRNA by means of NetGene2
is a joint assignment method combining consensus
sequence information with parameters of coding/noncoding transitions. It could be argued that an overlapping
gene structure may interfere with these criteria. However,
NetGene2 performs reliably in the prediction of splicing
events that have been described to occur (Fig 4). For
instance, Hass and coworkers [21] observed that a single
G458A mutation prevented splicing from 459 to 1304 or
1384 (Fig. 4, cases 6 and 7). The donor sites 2088, 2448,
2472 and acceptor sites 2351, 2901, 283, 488 have also
been identified as contributing to the splicing of HBV
RNAs (i.e. Fig 4, case 5), some in genotypes other than D
[13-17].
RNA splicing predictions for HBV genotype D
representatives
The ability to promote 2986-202 RNA splicing may not be
a special property of d4 HBV. In a collection of 104 HBV
genotype D representatives, NetGene2 reported another
32 cases. Remarkably, 29 of these strains constitute a separate clade in a phylogenetic tree based on amino acid

replacements in the polymerase protein of these viruses
(Fig 5). A tree based on amino acid replacements in the
large surface protein (not shown) generated a similar
result with (A/D recombinant) strain AF297620 at the
core of the clade as a neighbor of d4. Genotype D representatives outside this clade (referred to as the "black collection") may differ from the true clade members ("grey
clade") by a diminished tendency to develop the occult
phenotype by means of 2986-202 RNA splicing as marked
by clade member d4 HBV. The consensus sequences of the
2986 donor and 202 acceptor sites are present almost
ubiquitously among the entire collection and hence, the
enhanced scores of the proposed intron sequences may be

a distinctive property of the clade members. To explore
the proposed intron sequence in more detail, we compared a consensus polymerase sequence from the "grey"
clade with that of the "black" collection and found 7
nucleotide differences between the proposed intron
regions of these two sequences. Solely, the 7th mutation
T173G displayed the ability of changing a grey phenotype
(T) into a black one (G) and vice versa. This mutation is
synonymous in the reading frame for surface protein
(13Leu) and replaces a Ser (T) for an Ala (G) at the
polymerase frame. The nucleotides A (Thr) and C (Pro)
have not been found in this position. The T-to-G mutation interrupts a polypyrimidine tract that is likely to pro-

mote RNA splicing at the neighboring 202 splice acceptor
site [23,29]. Also, the mutation appeared to change the
local secondary structure of the RNA (Fig 6). The polypyrimidine tract required for appropriate splicing at the 202
acceptor site is either exposed in a loop structure (grey
clade) or buried in a base-paired stem (black collection).
It has been reported that changes in local RNA structure
can modulate the splicing efficiency [24].
In conclusion, a single nucleotide substitution brings on a
bipartition among the genotype D HBVs causing a difference in tendency for 2986-202 RNA splicing and hence for
the development of an overt into an occult HBV infection.

Discussion
We describe a thusfar unrevealed RNA splicing alternative
(2986-202) that is prominent in a subset of genotype D
HBV strains. Splicing of HBV RNA according to this scenario will suppress the expression of surface proteins and

spares the functions dedicated to the core and X proteins
and to the functional domains (terminal protein, reverse
transcriptase and RNAse H) of the viral polymerase. Consequently, virus genomes do replicate and are being
encapsidated properly, but the virions are defective due to
the absence of surface protein. These virus particles
remain captured intracellularly and their propagation
becomes dependent on liver cell division. Their release
(without immune-reactive surface protein) to an individual's circulation and immune system depends on the turnover of the infected liver cells. These properties are typical
for HBV variants in blood samples of individuals with
occult infection [1] like the HBV strains from the donors
1–5 [7]. Moreover, we observed enhanced accumulation
of mutations in the d4 variant compared to "wild-type"

protein. Increased rates of mutation and locally diminished protein functionality correlate with the long lasting
period since the d4 individual has cleared an overt HBV
infection [7].
Experimental evidence for a causal connection of 2986202 RNA splicing with occult HBV infection is currently

lacking, which is mainly due to the fact that collecting
liver biopsies from healthy volunteers with occult HBV
infection is much more complicated than obtaining
blood samples. When analyzing occult HBV in blood
samples, selection is inevitably in favor of HBV variants
that have reached the patient's circulation. The results of
splice prediction in HBV of frozen liver specimens (DQ

series, [8]) indicate that a relation of 2986-202 RNA splicing with occult HBV infection is not based solely on the
analysis of HBV in blood samples. Also, HBV variants
without cell-leaving capabilities may gradually induce
symptoms of chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis as long as
HBV gene expression remains detectable [30]. Co-infection [2], drug abuse [3] or immunosuppression [4] may
cause the appearance of HBV DNA in blood without
detectable HBsAg, due to enhanced turn-over rate of liver
cells.
Our observation that genotype D variants susceptible to
2986-202 splicing constitute a clade in the phylogenetic
tree derived from 3/4 of the complete genome sequence
indicates that minor sequence variations may affect regulators of splicing events in individual HBV strains. We
show that a single nucleotide mutation is able to activate
in cis a previously inactive splice acceptor site. mRNA
splicing is a classic example of virus-host interaction and
thereby depends on the condition of the infected cell,
which worsens by cirrhosis, necrosis or apoptosis. On the
other hand, many splicing events interfere with virus
genome replication by the deletion of vital polymerase
protein domains and/or by a shift in the original reading
frame at the donor/acceptor junction. Splicing of the
sequence 2986-202 is rather unique in that the viral reading frames as well as essential polymerase functions
remain unaffected. The PRE sequence, which overlaps
with sequences encoding the RNAse H domain of
polymerase, is too far downstream to interfere with the
splicing event and remains available for transport of the
spliced transcript. From the evolutionary point of view,
the purifying selective pressure, which intracellularly
guards viral genome replication and its encapsidation to
prevent degradation, operates properly in the absence of
surface proteins. Amino acid sites prone to relaxation of
selective constraints tend to display an enhanced rate of
replacement as observed for surface protein in the case of
an occult HBV infection, particularly in the a-determinant
region overlapping the polymerase sequence, which is
absent in reverse transcriptases of other viruses (i.e. avian
HBV, [25]). The C-gene region involved in the formation
of the core/surface protein interface is not protected by the
extra constraints of an overlapping reading frame. In conclusion, there is no selective pressure preventing the formation and intracellular accumulation of encapsidated
HBV particles. Hence, the splicing event 2986-202 generates infectivity-deficient virus particles with a life-span as
long as that of the infected host cell.
May some of these surface protein deficient HBV variants
reacquire the ability to initiate productive infection after a
prolonged period of occult infection? Relevant scenarios
must include a restoration of virus functionality damaged
during the period of latency. From the evolutionary point

http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/146

of view, it is beyond expectation that these deficient
viruses are able to achieve this solely by means of random
mutation and natural selection within the duration of an
individual's life, particularly because virus propagation
approaches the zero level. Other options of the virus to
regain infectivity and propagation are complementation
and/or recombination catalyzed by superinfection of the
host cell with another HBV strain. Also, it is likely that a
single individual with occult HBV infection may carry
quasi-species with different causes of latency waiting for
superinfection or other triggers to become reactivated.
This scenario gains improbability with time as inactivating mutations will accumulate in the surface protein
genes. Finally, a small fraction of the liver cells may escape
the scenario towards occult infection and may still continue to produce small amounts of infectious virions,
which are effectively scavenged by the immune system of
an alert host. These cells may induce a reactivation
towards overt HBV infection under conditions of immunosuppression. The duration of occult HBV infection – in
particular the impact of accumulated mutations – might
be an important parameter in order to discern a superinfection from a reactivated existing HBV infection.

Conclusion
A novel splicing opportunity of HBV mRNA prevents surface protein expression in HBV genotype D without affecting other gene functions (polymerase, capsid and Xprotein). This splicing event may become dominant by
intracellular evolution and selection. In this case, S-antigen is no longer produced and E-antigen is still secreted.
A minute amount of HBV DNA can be detected in the
patient's blood due to regular turn-over of infected cells.
These criteria match the definition of an occult HBV infection.

Methods
Recently, we obtained HBV sequences from five donors
with occult HBV infection (donors 1–5, GenBank accession numbers EU155889–EU155895), including a fulllength genome (EU155893, d4) and six shorter sequences
[7]. All of them belong to genotype D as shown by STAR
[31] and NCBI [32] analyses. We compared d4 HBV DNA
with other human HBV genotype D full-length genomes
that were annotated previously [28]. X02496 was used as
a reference sequence for HBV genotype D [33]. HBV numbering starts conventionally at the EcoR1 restriction site.
ClustalW [34] was used for alignment purposes. Neighbor-joining trees (500 bootstrap replicates) were built in
MEGA3.1 [35] applying pairwise deletion and JTT [36] or
Poisson-corrected models of amino acid replacement.
Phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood (PAML
3.15, [37]) was employed to investigate adaptive evolution in d4 branches among the other genotype D branches
in S, P, C and X trees. The free-ratios model 1 of PAML,

assuming an independent dN/dS ratio (non-synonymous/synonymous nucleotide substitutions) for each
branch, turned out to be too parameter-rich. Therefore,
clade and branch labels were introduced in newick-formatted trees and upon analysis by means of model 2, dN/
dS ratios of clades and branches were presented as branch
labels in compressed versions of topology trees. Procedures on the generation of 3D-structures of proteins
[38,39] and the application of computational alanine
replacement scanning [26] in order to elucidate the interface composition between surface and core proteins have
been described previously [25]. The PDB entry 1qgt [40]
was the source of the crystal structure of HBV core protein
[41]. Docking two protein structures into a single 3Dcomplex was attained by applying ClusPro [27]. Prediction of RNA splicing was performed by means of the
NetGene2 server [42,43]. Cutoff values for confidence
were 50% and 20% for the "nearly all true" qualification
of donor and acceptor sites, respectively. BioEdit [44] was
used for the construction of consensus sequences. RNA
secondary structure predictions were obtained by means
of the Mfold algorithm [45].
