Abstract
Background: Leishmania (Leishmania) major, one of the agents causing cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in
humans, is widely distributed in the Old World where different species of wild rodent and phlebotomine
sand fly serve as animal reservoir hosts and vectors, respectively. Despite this, strains of L. (L.) major
isolated from many different sources over many years have proved to be relatively uniform. To investigate
the population structure of the species highly polymorphic microsatellite markers were employed for
greater discrimination among it's otherwise closely related strains, an approach applied successfully to
other species of Leishmania.
Results: Multilocus Microsatellite Typing (MLMT) based on 10 different microsatellite markers was
applied to 106 strains of L. (L.) major from different regions where it is endemic. On applying a Bayesian
model-based approach, three main populations were identified, corresponding to three separate
geographical regions: Central Asia (CA); the Middle East (ME); and Africa (AF). This was congruent with
phylogenetic reconstructions based on genetic distances. Re-analysis separated each of the populations
into two sub-populations. The two African sub-populations did not correlate well with strains'
geographical origin. Strains falling into the sub-populations CA and ME did mostly group according to their
place of isolation although some anomalies were seen, probably, owing to human migration.
Conclusion: The model- and distance-based analyses of the microsatellite data exposed three main
populations of L. (L.) major, Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa, each of which separated into two subpopulations. This probably correlates with the different species of rodent host.

Background
Leishmania (Leishmania) major is one of the agents causing
Old World cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in humans,
which, in the case of L. (L.) major, is a rural, zoonotic, vector-borne disease, involving different species of wild
rodents as animal reservoir hosts and different species of
phlebotomine sand flies as vectors, depending on the geographical location where it occurs (reviewed, [1].
Humans, though infected in large numbers, are considered to be incidental hosts not directly implicated in the
transmission cycle [2].
The parasite and, thus, the disease are geographically
widely distributed in the arid and semi-arid areas of:
North-West, North, Central sub-Saharan and East Africa;
the Near and Middle East; Central Asia; and Rajasthan,
India. Despite the very broad geographical distribution
and large variety of types of wild animal host and sand fly
vector, the different strains of L. (L.) major isolated from
many sources over many years have proved to be relatively
uniform when studied by most of the classical and more
modern methods used for characterizing leishmanial
strains. Serological tests like excreted factor (EF) serotyping and the application of Leishmania species-specific
monoclonal antibodies have shown that antigenic differences exist among different strains of L. (L.) major [3].
Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (MLEE) exposed some
enzyme electrophoretic variation with some isoenzyme
variant profiles showing a degree of geographical subdivision within a general enzyme electrophoretic uniformity [4-6].
The more recent application of various molecular biological methods revealed geographically distributed genetic
polymorphism among different strains of L. (L.) major.
Analysis of sequence polymorphisms in seven coding,
non-coding and anonymous nuclear DNA sequences [1]
as well as a partial sequence from the kinetoplast DNA
maxicircle divergent region [7] of strains of L. (L.) major
showed that the strains from Central Asia and the Middle
East were genetically distinct. None to very little variation
was seen among the Central Asian strains and somewhat
more among the Middle Eastern ones. Only a few East
African strains of L. (L.) major were included in these studies, which tended to be genetically closer to the Middle
Eastern than to the Central Asian ones. Different patterns
in the most variable sequence were attributed to variations in complex microsatellite repeats. This prompted a
search for highly polymorphic microsatellite markers that
would allow greater discrimination of otherwise closely
related strains of L. (L.) major.
Microsatellites are repeated simple motifs of a few nucleotides (<6) flanked by unique sequences. They are ubiquitous in prokaryotes and eukaryotes and have been shown

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/183

to exhibit a substantial level of polymorphism in a
number of eukaryotic genomes [8,9]. They are becoming
one of the principal genetic marker systems in phylogenetic, population genetic and molecular epidemiological
studies. The leishmanial genome is relatively rich in microsatellite sequences, about 600 (CA)n loci per haploid
genome, with CA being the most abundant dinucleotide
repeat as in all vertebrates and fungi investigated so far [911]. Microsatellite markers have been used successfully for
characterizing and detecting genetic variation in other Old
World leishmanial strains and species, i. e., L. (Leishmania) donovani and L. (Leishmania) infantum [12-14] and L.
(Leishmania) tropica [15].
This study adds the species L. (L.) major. Ten informative
microsatellite loci based on nucleotide sequence information of L. (L.) major obtained from the Leishmania genome
project were used to determine polymorphism and microheterogeneity, and their geographical and epidemiological distribution.

Results
Microsatellite analysis
Twenty-three sequences located on chromosomes 1, 3, 5,
21 and 35 that contained nucleotide repeats such as
(AT)n, (GC)n, (CA)n, (GTG)n, and (GACA)n were
selected from the genome sequence of L. (L.) major published by the European Bioinformatics Institute. PCR
primers were designed for microsatellite loci that contained at least 6 repeats in the reference strain L. (L.) major
MHOM/IL/1980/Friedlin and were located on different
chromosomes or, if located on the same chromosome,
were at least distant enough to be considered unlinked
(Table 1). Fifteen of the 23 primer pairs yielded a single
PCR fragment for the majority of the strains tested. Ten of
these 15 primer pairs amplified polymorphic fragments of
different size in different strains of L. (L.) major (Table 1).

Only 4 out of 45 pair-wise combinations (9%) were in significant linkage disequilibrium (P < 0.05) when GENEPOP was used. No linkage was observed using the
Bonferroni corrections implemented in FSTAT.
The 10 polymorphic loci were used to perform multilocus microsatellite typing (MLMT) on 106 strains of L.
(L.) major collected in 10 Asian and 9 African countries.
Four of the 10 loci showed only homozygous allele combinations. However, three GTG loci, two AT loci and the
GACA locus were heterozygous for one or more of the
strains (see Additional file 1). In some cases, no PCR
product could be obtained in repeated PCR runs, which
was treated as missing data for the statistical analyses.
Sixty-six differing MLMT profiles comprising the number
of repeats in each of the 10 markers were revealed among

the 106 strains (see Additional file 1). The MLMT profiles
were named Lmj, thus indicating that these microsatellite
profiles are unique to L. (L.) major, and numbered from 1
to 66. Figures 1 to 3 show their genetic inter-relationship.
Most profiles were represented by a single strain; eleven
were present in more than one strain. Nine microsatellite
variant profiles were exposed among the 23 strains in the
sub-population CA1; six among the 16 strains in the subpopulation CA2; thirteen among the 26 strains in the subpopulation ME1; fifteen among the 17 strains in the subpopulation ME2; eleven among the 11 strains in the subpopulation AF1; and twelve among the 13 strains in the
sub-population AF2 (see Table 2, and Figure 2 for origins
and geographical distributions).
Table 3 shows that the number of alleles varies between
loci, ranging from 3 to 10. An increased degree of inbreeding within loci (Fis) was detected, ranging from
0.874–1.00 (P < 0.05) with a mean of 0.976. Observed
heterozygosity (Ho) among loci was extremely low compared with the heterozygosity (He) expected under
assumption of the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. These
results clearly show that L. (L.) major is largely clonal and
that hybridization only occurs at very low frequencies.
Population structure
The population structure was investigated, using the Bayesian-model based clustering approach implemented in
the software STRUCTURE [16]. The most probable
number of populations in this data set by calculating ΔK
was three: Central Asia (CA, comprising strains from

Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan; the Middle
East (ME), comprising strains from Israel, The Palestinian
Authority, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and eastern Turkey; and Africa (AF), comprising strains from North, East
and West Africa, western Turkey, Iran and Iraq (Figure 1A
and Table 2).
STRUCTURE analyses were re-done with each of the three
main populations, CA, ME and AF, to expose further subdivision; and each main population did separate into two
sub-populations: CA1 and CA2; ME1 and ME2; AF1 and
AF2 (Figures 1B, C and 1D, Table 2). Although calculations of ΔK do not allow for differentiation between one
or two groups in the dataset, the strains' assignment
(Table 2) was most congruent with the existence of two
sub-populations. The distribution of the different subpopulations is shown in Figure 2.
On using a predefined clustering approach, the total area
from which the strains of L. (L.) major were collected was
divided into five geographical sectors: Central Asia (CA),
the Middle East (ME), North, West and East Africa with
the last three being referred to collectively as Africa (AF).
The boundaries between these sectors are mainly significant geographical barriers like seas and deserts. Each
strain was assigned to one of the sectors, according to its
place of collection without regard to underlying genetic
relationships (Figure 3). The Central Asian cluster was
highly homogenous, genetically and according to predefined geographical placement, with all the strains having
a very high membership coefficient of 0.999. The Middle

the exclusion of the two western Turkish and sole Iraqi

strains. The entire African cluster was very heterogeneous
regarding MLMT profiles and did not separate into dis-

envisaged by the predefined clustering approach.
Increasing values of K (2–6) were used to identify ancestral populations. At K = 2, the first split separated the population CA from other strains. At K = 3, three main

populations, CA, ME and AF were exposed. At K = 4, the
African strains split into two clusters. At K = 5, the Middle
Eastern cluster separated into two distinct sub-clusters,
ME1 and ME2 while at K = 6 the population CA split into
the sub-clusters CA1 and CA2.
Construction of distance trees
For the phylogenetic analyses of these strains of L. (L.)
major, the dataset was clone-corrected and presented 66
microsatellite genotypes. NJ and UPMGA trees were constructed from the different distance matrices obtained. All
phylograms displayed the same five clusters, albeit with
different bootstrap support values, as shown, for example,
in the unrooted NJ tree (Figure 4) that was based on a Dps
distance matrix and has: i) a Central Asian cluster; ii) two
clusters of strains from the Middle East, corresponding to

the sub-populations ME1 and ME2 as determined by
STRUCTURE, and iii) two clusters of strains from Africa,
which correlate perfectly with the sub-populations AF1
and AF2 as determined by STRUCTURE. The sub-division
seen in the Central Asian cluster is largely congruent with
the two sub-populations CA1 and CA2 identified by
STRUCTURE. As in the STRUCTURE analysis, the two
western Turkish strains (Lmj 36) grouped with the strains
in the sub-population AF2 while the eastern Turkish one
(Lmj 50) belonged to the sub-population ME 1. The two
strains from Saudi Arabia formed a unique branch in the
unrooted NJ tree, closer to the Central Asian cluster, however with only low bootstrap values.

Population genetic data
Fst, as a measure of genetic differentiation between populations, calculated in a pair-wise manner for the main
populations, revealed high genetic differentiation
between the populations CA and ME, and CA and AF.
Genetic isolation was less pronounced between the populations ME and AF. When Fst was calculated at a sub-population level, moderate (Fst = 0.05 – 0.15), high (Fst =
0.15 – 0.25) and very high (Fst > 0.25) genetic differentiation was observed for the pairs AF1/AF2, ME1/ME2 and
CA1/CA2, respectively (Table 4).

Genetic flow or migration rate, Nm, refers to the movement of strains between populations and sub-populations
and sets a limit as to how much genetic divergence can
occur. At the sub-population level, the genetic flow was

the highest between the two African sub-populations and
the least between the two Central Asian sub-populations
(Table 4). At the pre-defined population classification,
there was clear genetic flow (Nm) between the African
regions (1.4962 and 1.7216).
The numbers of alleles encompassed by geographical
groupings
To compare the number of alleles falling within the three
main geographical groupings, the MLMT profiles were
grouped according to their geographical origin as specified by their WHO codes: Central Asia (15 profiles); the
Middle East (27 profiles); and Africa (21 profiles). In
order to compare groups of equal size, a re-sampling procedure was used [15]. The African group had the highest

Discussion
Elfari et al. [1] showed that genetic and biological variation among strains of L. (L.) major tended to correspond
with their geographical origin. Among the several analytical techniques and methods developed in that study, only
two employed genetic markers that were polymorphic
enough to distinguish between closely related strains. For

The average sample size (N), average number of alleles per locus (A),
expected proportion of heterozygotes (He), observed proportion of
heterozygotes (Ho) (by Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium) and inbreeding
coefficient (Fis) were obtained using GDA software. LD was
calculated using GENEPOP and FSTAT software.

population genetic studies of L. (L.) major like this one,
highly discriminative markers had to be developed. Of the
microsatellite markers designed, ten, all based on
sequences published by the Leishmania Genome Project
[11], have proved to be suitable for multilocus microsatellite typing (MLMT). Microsatellite analysis of the 106
strains of L. (L.) major revealed 66 different microsatellite
profiles. These were unique to this species of Leishmania
and demonstrated substantial genetic micro-heterogeneity with regard to microsatellite profiles. In many cases in
this study, particular microsatellite profiles were found in
single strains. Had many more strains of L. (L.) major been
available, these profiles would, probably, have been associated with groups of strains as was seen with the strains
isolated at Mubarak and Termez, Uzbekistan, (Table 2
and Figure 3).
The model- and distance-based analyses of the microsatellite data exposed three main populations of L. (L.) major,
corresponding to three separate geographical regions,
Central Asia, the Middle East and Africa. When the data
were analyzed by STRUCTURE with an increase in the
number of populations from 2 to 6 in order to identify the
ancestral source population, the first split separated the
Central Asian strains of L. (L.) major from all the others,
suggesting, possibly, their older origin. The Bayesian algorithm implemented in STRUCTURE was more appropriate for characterizing population structure because it
identified distinct sub-populations based on patterns of
allele frequencies and, also, determined fractions of the
genotype that belong specifically to each sub-population.
STRUCTURE has been shown to accurately infer individ-

The presence of these three populations was supported by
the detection of genetic isolation among them, particularly between population CA and the two populations AF

and ME that were separate but genetically closer to one
another. This may reflect the geographical distance and
barriers between the three main clusters (data not shown).

Both types of analysis led to sub-division of the main clusters. Congruence of the results supported tripartite clustering despite the absence of strong bootstrap values on the
main branches of the distance tree (Figures 4 and 5). The
two sub-groups in each of the three main populations
were also supported by F-statistics, although the genetic
differentiation was less pronounced, especially between
the sub-populations AF1 and AF2, and between the subpopulations ME1 and ME2. Wright (1978) maintained
that even slight genetic differentiation among sub-populations is significant.
Within the context of this study, it seems that the populations AF and ME were more genetically diversified than
the population CA. This might be due to different sampling procedures in the three areas. The 22 strains from
Africa were collected between 1976 and 2004 in 16 separated locations. In contrast to that, the 37 ME strains were
collected between 1967 and 2003 from different foci
encompassed by the Eastern Mediterranean region and
Arabian peninsula, and the 39 strains from Central Asia
between 1973 and 2003 in only 3 countries. To correct, at
least partially, for this sampling bias mean number of alleles have been calculated based on the MLMT profiles
present in the three areas, e.g. by excluding profiles shared
by more than one strain. When corrected for Central Asia,
the smallest group, the lowest number of alleles was still
found in Central Asia followed by the Middle East and
then Africa. The sampling bias might still account for the
high heterogeneity of the African strains, but the differences in diversity for CA and ME strains cannot be
explained only by differences in sampling. Most of the ME
strains were collected in Israeli and Palestinian foci from
a territory much smaller than the Central Asian area. The
area from where the Central Asian strains of L. (L.) major
studied here came is a landlocked generally arid plateau.
The greater variation of habitats and biotopes within Middle Eastern environments seems to translate into a greater
variety of animal hosts and sand fly vectors compared to
Central Asia.
Where groups of strains with the same microsatellite profile were available, it was possible to make some assessment with regard to time and spatial distribution. For
example, the strains in the groups of strains with the microsatellite profiles Lmj 6, Lmj 15 and Lmj 40 were isolated
in a given area for each group at the same time or within
short periods of time. However, strains with the microsatellite profile Lmj 1, Lmj 39 and Lmj 53 were isolated in
several locations at different times. This, in addition to the
observed low heterozygosity at microsatellite loci, seems
to provide evidence against extensive and frequent genetic
exchange within L. (L.) major. That microsatellite variants
can persist for long periods of time and are restricted or
widely spread in their distribution, supposedly, results

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/183

from the effect of biotopic conditions on the animal hosts
and vectors of leishmanial parasites and much less so in
the case of the humans, who do alter the biotope by construction, agriculture and many of their other activities.
Most of the strains in the population ME came from Israel
and The Palestinian Authority and their separation into
the sub-populations ME1, Jordan Valley-Dead Sea area,
and ME2, the Negev-Sinai area, did seem to parallel geographical distribution but not entirely so. Most 'misplaced' strains were from human cases and could be
explained by travel and migration between these areas.
Several strains have membership coefficients for both subpopulations, indicating gene flow between them.
The two African sub-populations did not correlate well
with the geographical origin of the strains that fell into
them. Their analysis was hampered owing to the small
number of strains available and their very wide geographical dispersal. Unlike Dps-based phenetic analysis (NJ,
UPGMA), which is not affected by population size [18],
STRUCTURE improves with increasing sample size for
each population [16]. In this study, the results obtained
using STRUCTURE were consistent with those of the phenetic analysis. Nevertheless, more strains from different
African foci need to be analysed to really determine the
population structure of African strains of L. (L.) major.
Preferably, one should use strains isolated from sand fly
vectors and rodent hosts to avoid the effect of human
migration. Small sample size was also a problem in the
case of the two single strains from Iran and Iraq and the
two from western Turkey that grouped together with the
African strains and the eastern Turkish strain that grouped
with the Middle Eastern strains (Table 2 and Figure 3).
Waki et al. [19] hypothesized that adaptation to the
micro-environment in the macrophages of the mammalian hosts, the place of long-term residence of all leishmanial parasites, including L. (L.) major, is most significant
in the evolution of the genus Leishmania. They considered
adaptation to the sand fly vectors' gut, the place of shortterm residence, to be of lesser evolutionary importance.
That the three main populations of L. (L.) major identified
by this study exist in endemic foci that each have different
rodent species serving as the reservoir hosts [20] seems to
support this hypothesis. Variation among the strains of L.
(L.) major from the same endemic area leading to different
sub-populations could be attributed to differences in sand
fly vector populations. For instance, analysis of mitochondrial cytB haplotypes exposed two genetically distinct
populations of Ph. papatasi in the Middle East [21].

Conclusion
Multilocus Microsatellite Typing (MLMT) based on 10 different microsatellite markers and using a Bayesian model-

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:183

based analysis as well as phylogenetic reconstructions
based on genetic distances, identified three main populations, corresponding to three separate geographical
regions: Central Asia (CA); the Middle East (ME); and
Africa (AF). Each of them separated into two sub-populations which might reflect the existence of different species
of rodent host in these areas. The African and Middle Eastern populations seemed to be more genetically diversified
than the Central Asian population. Sampling bias might
account for the high heterogeneity of the African strains
but cannot explain the differences in diversity for Central
Asian and Middle Eastern strains.

Methods
The parasites
Table 2 lists the 106 strains of L. (L.) major used. They represented almost the whole geographical range of the species. No strains from Afghanistan and Rajasthan, India,
were available.

Most of them were from the collections kept in The
Department of Parasitology of Hebrew University Jerusalem, The Leishmania Research Unit, The Islah Clinic, Jericho, The Isaev Research Institute of Medical Parasitology
Samarkand, The Martsinovsky Institute of Medical Parasitology, Moscow, and The Leishmania Reference Centre,
CHU of Montpellier.
Cultivation of the parasites and extraction of DNA were
done according to [22]. DNA of MHOM/WA/87/NEL2, a
strain isolated from a patient who had travelled in North,
West and East Africa, was obtained from Dr. H. Schallig of
the Royal Tropical Institute Amsterdam, and DNA from
three Sudanese strains from Dr. M. Mukhtar of the Institute of Endemic Diseases, University of Khartoum. DNA
from the three Turkish strains [23] was provided by Dr.
K.P. Chang of the Department of Microbiology/Immunology, Chicago Medical School, Chicago, IL, USA.
Microsatellite loci
Microsatellite loci were identified by searching the nucleotide sequence information assembled by the 'Leishmania
major Friedlin Genome project [24]. PCR primers potentially suited for locus-specific amplification were designed
by deducing 20-nucleotide long primers from sequences
precisely 5 nucleotides upstream and downstream of the
repeat. The primer sequences and their annealing temperatures are listed in Table 1.

Amplification was performed in volumes of 50 μl. Twenty
ng DNA were added to a PCR mixture containing: 200 μM
of each dNTP; 1.5 mM MgCl2; 1 U Taq polymerase (Perkin-Elmer), and 20 pmol of forward primer and 15 pmol
of reverse primer. Samples were overlaid with sterile, light
mineral oil and amplified in a Robocycler Gradient 40

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/8/183

(Stratagene) with initial denaturation at 95°C for 6 min
followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 sec,
annealing at the specific primer annealing temperature
(Table 1) for 30 sec and extension at 72°C for 1 min. This
was followed by a final extension cycle at 72°C for 10
min. DNA of L. (L.) major MHOM/IL/1980/Friedlin was
amplified in each experiment as a positive control.
Microsatellite electrophoretic analysis
Amplification products were analyzed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), or MetaPhor agarose
(Cambrex Bio Science Rockland, Inc, Rockland ME, USA)
gel, or capillary electrophoresis. The strain L. (L.) major
MHOM/IL/1980/Friedlin was included in every experiment. For PAGE, 15–25 μl of the PCR product were mixed
with loading buffer and separated in 12% polyacrylamide
gel under non-denaturating conditions at a constant voltage of 1000 V for 4 h or at 8–10 W overnight. Gels were
silver-stained and dried as described by Lewin et al. [25].
Screening for microsatellite variation was also done using
3.5% MetaPhor agarose gels [13]. The lengths of PCR
products in PAGE and Metaphor agarose electrophoresis
were determined by comparing them with small-molecular-size markers (10-bp ladder; Invitrogen, Life Tech,
Carlsbad, CA USA). Fluorescent-labelled PCR products
were analyzed and measured for size with the fragment
analysis tool of the CEQ 8000 automated genetic analysis
system (Beckman Coulter, USA) as previously described
[13,26]. The fragment sizes estimated by the different
methods used were always compared to that of strain L.
(L.) major MHOM/IL/1980/Friedlin. Repeat numbers
were calculated based on the repeat numbers of the
respective marker in strain L. (L.) major MHOM/IL/1980/
Friedlin.
Data analysis
The software STRUCTURE Version 2 [16] was used to
reveal potential population structure in the data set. The
programme was run using an admixture model with a
burn-in period of 30,000 iterations, followed by
1,000,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) repeats.
Based on allele frequencies, this approach identifies
genetically distinct populations by estimating, for each
individual studied, in this case each leishmanial strain,
the fraction of the genotype belonging solely to it. Individuals can be assigned to multiple clusters with the membership coefficients of all those clusters summing up to one.
The most fitting number of populations was determined
by comparing log-likelihood values for K (number of
populations) between 1 and 10. These were plotted and
the value of K at the plateau (maximum) of the Gaussian
graph plotted indicated the most likely population structure. In order to quantify the degree of variation of the
likelihood for each K, ten runs were performed for each K.
In addition, ΔK was calculated based on the rate of change

Page 11 of 13
(page number not for citation purposes)

BMC Evolutionary Biology 2008, 8:183

in the log probability of data between successive K values
[27]. Moreover, runs were conducted with strains assigned
to 5 pre-defined populations (Central Asia, the Middle
East, North Africa, East Africa and West Africa), according
to the actual geographical origin of the CL isolates.
Different microsatellite genetic distance measurements
based on the infinite allele model (IAM) and on the stepwise mutation model (SMM) were used to construct phylogenetic trees. The proportion of shared alleles (Dps)
[28] calculates multilocus pairwise distance measurements as 1 – (the total number of shared alleles at all loci/
n), where n is the number of loci compared. Chord distance [29], Nei's standard genetic distance [30] and delta
mu squared (Dmu2) [31], were also calculated. The last is
based on the average squared difference in allele size.
Confidence intervals for all distance measurements were
calculated by bootstrapping over loci, using the program
MICROSAT [32]. Neighbor-joining (NJ) and Unweighted
Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) consensus trees of both distances were then constructed in
PAUP, version 4.0b8 [33] and PHYLIP version 3.6 [34].
The degree of genetic difference among populations was
estimated by Wright's F-statistics [35], calculated according to Weir and Cockerham [36]. FSTAT software version
2.9.3.2 [37] was used to calculate Fis and Fst values, numbers of alleles per locus and genetic flow or migration rate,
as Nm = 1-Fst/4Fst [38]. Average sample size (n), mean
number of alleles per locus (A), observed (Ho) and
expected (He) heterozygosity under Hardy-Weinberg
equilibrium were calculated using Gene Data Analysis
(GDA), version 1.0 (d16c) [39]. The calculation was based
on the permutation method [40], which is useful for
multiallelic microsatellite loci. Pair-wise linkage disequilibrium (D) was calculated using GENEPOP and FSTAT.
The former applies Fisher's exact test [41] to the allele
combinations between all pairs of loci in the whole population and in each population, while the latter uses loglikelihood ratio G-statistics [36] with Bonferroni corrections for multiple comparisons.
To compare the allelic abundance in different geographical regions, the MLMT profiles of L. (L.) major were
grouped according to their main geographical origin:
Africa, Central Asia and Middle East. Profiles shared by
more than one strain were excluded from this analysis. To
compare the different groups, all of them were reduced to
the size of the smallest group, which was Central Asia with
12 MLMT profiles. The groups of larger size were re-sampled and the number of alleles in each group was estimated, using 100 replicates of the re-sampled data [15].
