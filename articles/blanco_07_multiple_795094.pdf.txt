Abstract
Background: The analysis of the promoter sequence of genes with similar expression patterns is
a basic tool to annotate common regulatory elements. Multiple sequence alignments are on the
basis of most comparative approaches. The characterization of regulatory regions from coexpressed genes at the sequence level, however, does not yield satisfactory results in many
occasions as promoter regions of genes sharing similar expression programs often do not show
nucleotide sequence conservation.
Results: In a recent approach to circumvent this limitation, we proposed to align the maps of
predicted transcription factors (referred as TF-maps) instead of the nucleotide sequence of two
related promoters, taking into account the label of the corresponding factor and the position in the
primary sequence. We have now extended the basic algorithm to permit multiple promoter
comparisons using the progressive alignment paradigm. In addition, non-collinear conservation
blocks might now be identified in the resulting alignments. We have optimized the parameters of
the algorithm in a small, but well-characterized collection of human-mouse-chicken-zebrafish
orthologous gene promoters.
Conclusion: Results in this dataset indicate that TF-map alignments are able to detect high-level
regulatory conservation at the promoter and the 3'UTR gene regions, which cannot be detected
by the typical sequence alignments. Three particular examples are introduced here to illustrate the
power of the multiple TF-map alignments to characterize conserved regulatory elements in
absence of sequence similarity. We consider this kind of approach can be extremely useful in the
future to annotate potential transcription factor binding sites on sets of co-regulated genes from
high-throughput expression experiments.

Background
Sequence comparisons are one of the most important
computational tools in molecular biology. Sequences are
good symbolic representations of biological molecules
that encode relevant information about their structure,
function and history. From the analysis of functionally

related sequences, biologically significant facts can be
inferred. For instance, genomic sequence comparisons are
performed in order to identify genes or regulatory sites
across evolutionarily related genomes, as these functional
elements tend to exhibit conservational patterns different
from those observed in regions that are not functional.

In attempt to allow for multiple sequence comparisons,
the basic dynamic programming recurrences introduced
in the 1970s to align efficiently two sequences of n symbols in time proportional to the square of the length of the
sequences [1,2], can be naturally extended for k
sequences, with an exponential cost O(nk)[3]. As this cost
is unaffordable in practice, many heuristics have appeared
to provide acceptable solutions with a minor cost. The
most popular of them is the progressive alignment [4,5].
This procedure is a greedy algorithm that runs in O(k2n2)
time. In a first step, the progressive alignment performs all
of the pairwise alignments to build an evolutionary tree.
In a second step, an initial alignment is constructed from
the two closest sequences, incorporating then the rest to
the profile following the guide tree. Such a procedure does
not guarantee to find the optimal solution in mathematical terms. However, the results are generally meaningful
from the biological standpoint.
These comparisons at the sequence level have limitations
however. Although similar sequences do tend to play similar biological functions, the opposite is not necessarily
true. Often similar functions are encoded in higher order
sequence elements that are not necessarily conserved at
the sequence level. As a result, similar functions are frequently encoded by diverse sequences which are undetectable by conventional sequence alignment methods.
Gene promoter regions are a good example. The information that governs the RNA synthesis is mostly encoded in
the gene promoter, a region normally 200 to 2000 nucleotides long upstream of the transcription start site of the
gene (TSS). Transcription factors (TFs) bind to sequence
specific motifs (the TF binding sites, TFBSs) within the
promoters. TFBSs are 5–8 nucleotides long and one promoter region contains on the order of 10 to 50 of them
[6]. Such motifs appear to be arranged in specific configurations that define the temporal and spatial transcriptional program of each gene. Genes presenting similar
expression patterns are assumed to share similar configurations of TFBSs in their promoters [7,8].
However, TFBSs associated to the same TF show often little sequence conservation. Therefore, promoter regions of
genes with similar expression pattern may not be similar
at the sequence level.
In a previous work [9], we showed that pairwise alignments between sequences of labels representing TFs binding to sites predicted in promoter regions (TF-maps)
could often uncover high-level common regulatory patterns which could not be found by typical nucleotide
sequence comparisons.

Here, we present an efficient implementation of the multiple TF-map alignment based in the progressive alignment paradigm. We have introduced some modifications
in the pairwise global TF-map alignment algorithm to
allow the alignment of TF-map alignments. In addition,
we have extended the algorithm to allow for non-collinear
alignments, which are rarely considered in conventional
dynamic programming algorithms, being only partially
identified by combining global and local alignment strategies [10,11]. The ability to predict non-collinear alignments may be particularly relevant in the case of promoter
regions, where the linearity of TFBSs configurations can be
weakly conserved [12].
The structure of the paper is the following: first, we briefly
review the concept of TF-map and provide the formal definition of a multiple TF-map alignment. Then, we introduce the algorithm to compute the optimal pairwise
alignment of two alignments. Next, we describe the main
algorithm that performs the progressive alignment of
multiple TF-maps. Later, we define formally a non-collinear alignment, introducing some modifications in the
basic algorithm. Finally, we systematically estimate the
optimal parameters of the alignment to distinguish promoters from other gene regions in a set of well characterized human-rodent gene pairs extracted from the ABS
database [13] and their corresponding orthologs in
chicken and zebrafish. These results are compared to
those obtained by conventional sequence alignment
methods. Three particular examples are presented in
which multiple TF-map alignments characterize conserved regulatory elements that are otherwise imperceptible in sequence-level comparisons.
TF-maps

Let ∑DNA be the alphabet of four nucleotides. Let ∑H be the
alphabet of symbols corresponding to higher-order elements that can be annotated over a genomic sequence, for
instance TFs. We define a generic mapping function as a

tool that identifies a set of unknown motifs conserved in
several promoters (e.g. MEME [17]). In practice, for each

real example in Figure 1(B)). We refer to the resulting
sequence of TF-tuples M as a Transcription Factor Map, or
simply a TF-map.

In the implementation here, matches to PWMs are considered strandless, that is, they are annotated at a given location, irrespective of the orientation in which they occur.
While biological evidence suggests that some TFBSs are
functional only when present in a given strand, in other
cases TF activity appears to be independent of the orientation of the binding site [18,19]. Since in general, we do
not have information of the strand in which a binding site
may be functional, we have not considered strand in our
analysis.

Here, we propose to adapt the popular progressive alignment strategy to the TF-map alignment. The solutions
obtained by this method are not guaranteed to be optimal. However, multiple progressive alignments usually
capture the sequence features underlying the common
functionality shared by the aligned sequences [5]. We
have generalized the basic pairwise TF-map alignment
algorithm developed in [9] in order to allow the comparisons between two single TF-maps, a TF-map and a MMA,
and two MMAs.

tion of distance between the sites of every map in two consecutive columns (i, i') with at least two aligned elements
in the MMA. That is, the score of the alignment increases
with the score of the aligned elements (α), and decreases
with the number of gaps (γ), the number of unaligned elements (λ), and with the difference in the distance between
adjacent aligned elements (μ). See [9] for further details
about the TF-map alignment parameters.
The algorithms
There are many possible alignments among multiple TFmaps. The optimal alignment is the one scoring the maximum (that is, showing maximum similarity) among all
possible alignments. In a previous work [9], we implemented a dynamic programming algorithm to obtain
such an alignment efficiently for the case of two TF-maps.
The optimal multiple sequence alignment problem (and
therefore the multiple alignment of maps as well) is, however, much more difficult, being formally a NP-complete
problem [20].

i,

my, j) denotes the score of the best TF-map alignment of

the alignments Ax = mx, 1 ... mx, i and Ay = my, 1 ... my, j as
defined previously (Equation 2). The ComputePairwiseSimilarity algorithm shown below is a generalization of that
developed in [9] to align two TF-maps that computes the
optimal pairwise TF-map alignment between Ax and Ay.
This algorithm basically searches the maps of both alignments to find matches between one site in the first alignment and one site in the second one. Once a new match
is identified, the previous matches must be evaluated in
order to construct the optimal alignment with this new
one (see Figure 2). Because this class of scoring matrices
are highly sparse [9], we register the coordinates in S of the
matches computed previously. Thus, to compute the optimal score at the cell S(i, j), only the non-empty cells in S
that are visible for the current match need to be accessed.
In addition, we maintain the list sorted by optimal score,
so that the cell scoring the maximum value is at the beginning of the list and, in most cases, only a few nodes will
need to be accessed before a critical node is reached
beyond which the optimal score can not be improved [9].
The number of computations P(n) in this algorithm is
very similar to that obtained in the conventional pairwise
TF-map alignment algorithm [9]. The exact complexity of
this algorithm is difficult to be studied – depending
mostly on the size of the input maps and the sparsity of
the resulting matrix S. An expected time cost analysis
reveals that the cost function can be explained in terms of
(a) a first quadratic term derived from the necessary comparison between all of the TFBSs of both maps to detect
the match cells and (b) a second quadratic term necessary
to search for each match the best adjacent previous pair in
the optimal TF-map alignment. In [9], we studied the positive contribution of using a list of non-empty cells in S
that reduces the second component to an expected cost of
O(p·n2), where p is the percentage of the similarity matrix

that is occupied. In the case of pairwise TF-map promoter
comparisons, this value was estimated to be below 0.05
(less than 5% of occupancy).

ComputePairwiseSimilarity
Require: Ax, Ay: TF-map alignments, L: list
of <abscissa, ordinate>, L = ∅

Implementation
In the pseudocode below, the alignments Ax and Ay are
represented as two arrays of sites sorted by the position in
their promoters, where each site corresponds to an input
TFBS. The MMAs are internally encoded with pointers
among the sites that form each match. Gaps here are not
explicitly represented. Each site mx, i is a structure as
described above with the functions factor, pos1, pos2 and
score returning the values of the corresponding fields.

{Calculating the element i, j in S}

The variable maxSim stores the optimal score computed so
far. The sites in the optimal TF-map alignment can be easily retrieved using a supplementary structure path(i, j) that
points to the previous cell in the optimal path leading to
cell S(i, j). In addition, the function ComputeInitialSimilarity calculates for each match S(i, j) the initial score of a
hypothetical alignment that includes only the sites mx, i
and my, j. Once the match between two sites mx, i and my, j
has been identified, the best previous match between two
other sites mx, i' and my, j' is used to construct the new alignment (see the matches A and B in Figure 2). The list L is
used to locate the non-empty positions in S. Each node of
the list L is represented as structures p and n with the functions abscissa and ordinate returning the corresponding
coordinates in S of each previous match.
The score of the new match between mx, i and my, j is the
sum of the scores of the columns in which both elements
were aligned in their respective MMAs. Unaligned sites are
scored with the gap penalty γ . The function ComputeLambda counts the number of sites in each group that are not
included in the alignment, taking into account the size of
each individual MMA.

In practice, we do not allow overlap in the primary

D2 between any pair of consecutive matches in the maps
of each alignment, verifying the absence of physical overlap in their promoters. The function |D1 - D2| scores the
conservation of distance between the sites of every map in
two consecutive columns on each MMA (function f, see

Progressive MMA algorithm
Let (A1 ... Ak) be the initial list of k TF-map alignments,
where each alignment Ai contains a single TF-map. Let S
be the similarity matrix where S(Ai, Aj) denotes the similarity between two TF-map alignments Ai and Aj.

The progressive MMA algorithm shown below builds up a
multiple TF-map alignment in a stepwise manner. In a
first step, all pairwise TF-map alignments are performed.
The initial multiple alignment is created with the two
most similar ones. These maps are substituted for the
alignment of both. The similarity between this new alignment and the rest of the TF-maps is then estimated, updating the S matrix (see Implementation).
In a second step, an iterative procedure selects at each
round the pair of alignments that are more similar from
Ay
α
Ax

Implementation
In the progressive MMA algorithm shown below, the variable maxSim saves the maximum score so far computed
at each round. The identifiers of the alignments that produce such a score can easily be retrieved using a supplementary pair of variables iSim, jSim.

The function ComputePairwiseSimilarity is a generalization
of the TF-map alignment algorithm presented in [9], as
explained in the previous section. The optimal pairwise
alignments between the input TF-maps in the initial
round are saved, as they could be required during the iterative procedure.
Once a new TF-map alignment is created from the two
most similar ones, their binding sites must be merged
(function MergeAlignments). The order of the TFBSs in the
new alignment must take into account the position of the
binding sites in their primary promoter sequences. In the
approach here, we do not create a profile of each MMA.
Instead, all of the TFBSs of each alignment are always
available for subsequent TF-map alignments.

The cost of the progressive MMA can be expressed in terms
of the number of pairwise TF-map alignments that must
be computed. Let k be the number of maps to be aligned
and n be the length of each map. The initial round performs O(k2) pairwise alignments. Next, the progressive
rounds perform O(k) alignments involving two previous
alignments. Let P(n) be the cost of each pairwise operation (see previous section), then the cost of the progressive map alignment algorithm is O(k2 P(n)).

new match between sites from both alignments must preserve the previous internal alignment (matches in red). For
each new match (A), the best previous aligned match (B)

The alignments between this new TF-map alignment and
the others are not explicitly computed. The similarity of
them is instead estimated with the WPGMA method
(Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean
[21]), in which the similarity of the previous alignments
between AiSim and AjSim to the other alignments is weighted
according to the number of maps of each one. If an estimated alignment between two MMAs is identified as the
most similar one during the progressive step, then it must
be explicitly computed before merging both TF-map
alignments.

Definition
Let T be an alignment between two TF-maps M1 and M2
formally defined as a correspondence T = {(m1, 1, m2, 1), ...,
(m1, t, m2, t)} [9]. Let (m1, i, m2, j) and (m1, k, m2, l) be two
matches in T, not necessarily contiguous, with i <k. Then,
we define the collinearity or non-collinearity of T in terms
of the partial order between j and l, for all the match pairs
of T as:

1. If j <l then T is a collinear alignment
2. If j > l then T is a non-collinear alignment (see example
shown in Figure 3(A)).
The generalization of this definition for k > 2 TF-maps is
trivial (see the example of a non-collinear alignment for k
= 3 TF-maps in Figure 3(B)).

Algorithm
The non-collinear matches shown in Figure 3 can not be
detected in the basic pairwise TF-map alignment algorithm [9]. Let A and B be two TF-maps in which two
matches could form a non collinear alignment (represented as a circle and a square in Figure 4). The normal
implementation fills the matrix in row by row, from top
to bottom (or column by column, from left to right).

According to this, when the first match is being processed
(red square), the second one (red circle) is not yet available (the red circle is not in the green area). Conversely,
when the second match is processed, the first one is not
accessible as the basic algorithm only allows the search for
best previous aligned elements in the list of computed values that are in the area delimited by the current match
(area denoted by dotted lines).

To overcome such a limitation, we propose to compute
the optimal values of the matrix S following a different
order, to allow the second element (red circle) to be visible when the first one is being processed (red square). A
diagonal filling of the matrix calculates first the match
between circles (see Figure 4).
Thus, this element will be available to compute the best
alignment for the match between squares that is processed
later. While this strategy still produces the same alignments obtained with the ordinary implementation, non-

5(A)). Then, a second match between one element in A
and another one in B is being processed (represented as
two squares in Figure 5(A)). The dotted lines indicate that
such a site in B can be located either on the left or on the
right of the circle site in the same map. In the first case, a
non-collinear alignment is produced; in the second case,
a normal collinear alignment is constructed. The case in
which the non-collinear match occurs in A can be similarly defined.
The algorithm to align two MMAs must be slightly modified to accomodate the non-collinearity parameter c. The
variable z in the ComputePairwiseSimilarity is defined now
as:

(D2 < 0) → μ | D1 − c ⋅ D2 |, c ≥ 1
.
(D2 ≥ 0) → μ | D1 − D2 |

⎧ if
z=⎨
⎩ if

The optimal positional conservation between both
matches occurs when D1 = D2. However, the parameter c
is used in the μ, penalty to punish only those matches that
do not respect the collinearity of the current alignment

TF-maps. In (B), the resulting multiple alignment of three
maps contains a non-collinear block of three TFBSs.

Adjusting the non-collinearity
We have designed a simple mechanism to adjust the frequency of non-collinear aligned sites in the output. An
additional parameter c has been introduced in the basic
MMA algorithm to weight those alignments involving
non-collinearity.

With the diagonal filling, a previous match (denoted as a red

(the square site is on the left of the circle site in B, see Figure 5(A)).
Informally, if c = 1 then both collinear and non-colinear
matches are indistinctly combined into the resulting
MMA. High values of c, however, produce a higher
amount of collinear matches into the results. In order to
establish formally the behaviour of this parameter, we
have counted the number of non-collinear matches in the
TF-map alignment of the human and mouse promoters
(500 nucleotides) of the MMP13 gene (RefSeq:
NM_002427, NM_008607). In Figure 5(B), there is a clear
correspondence between the amount of inversions in the
MMA and the value of c. No inversions are produced for
large values of c. Identification of non-collinear configurations of TFBSs in regulatory regions is poorly known, and
only a few cases are documented [22]. We recommend,
therefore, to use this option very carefully. In addition, we
also suggest the use of a small set of matrices to perform
the mapping, which can reduce the number of artifacts in
the resulting non-collinear MMA (see Promoter characterization section, even-skipped stripe 2 enhancer).

Datasets and software availability
The datasets used in this paper are available at [23]. An
implementation of this algorithm has been written in C
and is publicly available at [24]. A web server that performs the mapping and the alignment of multiple promoter regions with such an algorithm is accessible at [25].

The input of the program consists of a file that contains
the TF-maps to be aligned. The file must be in General
Feature Format [26]. Options allow to control the values
of α, λ, μ, γ and c as well as to display the results in plain
format or GFF format. The output includes the score and
the length of the optimal MMA, and the matches in the
input TF-maps (see Figure 6 for an example). A graphical
representation of the MMA is also displayed using the program gff2ps [27].

Results
The optimal MMA of a set of TF-maps is obviously
dependant on the values of the α, λ, μ, γ and c parameters.
In addition, the optimal parameter configuration is likely
to depend on the particular problem to be addressed
(orthologous genes or co-regulated genes in microarray
experiments), and the particular protocol to map the
TFBSs on the sequences.

Results in a previous work [9] indicated that TF-maps
alignments are able to characterize promoter regions of
co-regulated genes even in absence of sequence similarity.
Thus, TF-map alignments were shown to detect highorder regulatory signals conserved in a collection of
related promoters that were undetectable with current
sequence alignment methods. It is important to mention
that two or more different TFBSs can be aligned if and
only if they correspond to the same TF, even though they
may not show sequence similarity.
Here we have conducted a similar systematic training over
an extended set of orthologous promoters to obtain the
optimal parameter configuration. In order to verify the
ability of MMA to identify regulatory elements that are
rarely detected in conventional comparisons, we have
compared the results to those obtained by several multiple sequence alignment methods. We have focused on
two specific examples to show the abilities of MMA in the
characterization of multiple collinear related promoters.
Finally, we have characterized non-collinear arrangements of TFBSs on an early developmental enhancer conserved in several species of Drosophila.

Multiple TF-map training
For the pairwise TF-map alignment, we estimated the optimal parameters in a set of experimentally characterized
human and rodent gene promoters [9,13]. Here we have
extended such a dataset by searching the corresponding
orthologs in chicken and zebrafish as well. Using the RefSeq [28] gene set as mapped into the UCSC genome
browser, we have correctly identified the ortholog in both
species, if available. We refer to the resulting set of
human-mouse-chicken-zebrafish homologous genes as
the HRCZ SET. This dataset contains 18 human-rodentchicken-zebrafish orthologs, 7 human-rodent-chicken
orthologs, 4 human-rodent-zebrafish orthologs, and 7
human-rodent orthologs.

The lack of available collections of experimentally verified
TFBSs is an important limitation for the evaluation and
the training of phylogenetic footprinting systems. Despite
several databases of annotations and promoter sequences
have recently appeared [13,29], there is not enough regulatory information conserved among species other than
human and mouse to train the MMA.
Thus, we can not repeat the training procedure used in [9]
to evaluate the ability of MMA to detect conserved regulatory elements at larger evolutionary distances – at which
the degree of conservation may be negligible. However,
we can use another method also presented in [9] to show
that MMAs are much more informative than primary multiple sequence alignments.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/138

We first have mapped the TFBSs occurrences in the promoter sequences using the collection of 50 most informatives matrices in JASPAR 1.0 [14]. In a previous work [9],
we observed a substantial gain of specificity in the detection of real TFBSs (without a significant loss of sensitivity)
when using such a subset of matrices instead of the entire
JASPAR collection. The original frequency coefficients of
the matrices were converted before into log-likelihood
ratios, to which we referred as JASPARTOP50 in [9], using
the random equiprobability distribution as a background
model. A prediction obtained with a given PWM from
JASPARTOP50 was accepted if it had a score above 50% of
the maximum possible score for such matrix [23].
Then, we have compared the MMAs obtained in the 200
nucleotides of the promoter region of the 36 gene pairs
from the HRCZ SET, with the MMAs obtained using the
same mapping function in fragments of 200 nucleotides
from intergenic (2000 nucleotides upstream of the TSS,
2000 nucleotides downstream the transcript), 5'UTR
(downstream of the TSS), 3'UTR (upstream the end of the
transcript), coding (downstream of the translation start
site and considering only coding DNA), intronic (downstream of the first intron junction), and downstream
(downstream of the transcription termination site)
sequences (see Figure 7 for a graphical representation of
the test).
We have computed the average score of the MMA on each
one of the genomic regions, identifying the alignment

that produces the highest score for each orthologous set.
We have repeated this test using different combinations of
parameters. Systematically, the parameters α, λ, and μ
were allowed to independently take values between 0.0
and 1.0, in incremental steps of 0.1. At the same time, the
parameter γ (gap penalty) was tested between 0 and -10
with a step of -1. The optimal parameter configuration is
considered to be that set of parameter values that better
discriminate between promoters and the rest of genomic
regions.
We have also performed the multiple sequence alignments of the same regions using the following programs
(see [30] for a comprehensive review on DNA sequence
alignment): CLUSTALW [5], MLAGAN [31] and FOOTPRINTER [32]. CLUSTALW and MLAGAN perform global
multiple sequence alignment.
FOOTPRINTER performs local multiple sequence alignment. The number of significant motifs (parsimony score
2) identified by FOOTPRINTER on each gene region was
used to rank the alignments of this program.
Results appear in Table 1. As expected, nucleotide
sequence alignments score the highest in the coding
regions (in 27 out of 36 cases for CLUSTALW, 26 and 23
cases for MLAGAN and FOOTPRINTER respectively), followed by the alignments in the 5'UTRs (4 out of 36 for
CLUSTALW, 4 and 3 for MLAGAN and FOOTPRINTER)
and in the promoters (4 out of 36 for CLUSTALW, 4 and
5 for MLAGAN and FOOTPRINTER). Only in one case,
the 3'UTR was the most conserved region among
orthologs (in three cases for FOOTPRINTER). The scores
of the sequence alignments indicate that promoter regions
are less conserved than coding regions.
Despite this, the optimal collinear MMA configuration [α
= 1, λ = 0.3, μ = 0.1, γ = -2] scores the highest in the promoter regions (in 18 out of 36, see Table 1). In addition,
the average score of map alignments is notably higher
than that of the coding regions (25.41 against 17.15).
Only in 6 out of 36 cases the TF-map alignments score the
highest in coding regions. Interestingly, while 3'UTR
sequences in the human-mouse-chicken-zebrafish
orthologs are much less conserved than coding regions or
5'UTRs, MMAs score the highest in them in 7 cases. This is
consistent with recent investigations about the existence
of regulatory motifs in the 3'UTR regions of the genes
[33]. A similar result is obtained in the case of introns:
intronic sequences are much less conserved than coding
and UTR sequences. However, MMAs score the highest in
intronic regions in 2 cases. This fact is noticeable as first
introns are also known to often contain regulatory motifs
[34,35].

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/138

We have also performed a complementary test to measure
the specificity of the TF-map alignments. As a negative
control, we have shuffled the orthologous associations in
the HRCZ SET to construct a pool of 36 unrelated humanmouse-chicken-zebrafish gene entries. Then, the corresponding multiple TF-map alignments of these nonorthologous paired promoters were obtained using the
parameters previously optimized. Results appear in Table
2. The TF-map alignments of unrelated promoters were
significantly worse with an average score more than 50%
smaller than TF-map alignments that involved "bona
fide" orthologous promoters. For instance, the average
score of the TF-map alignments among orthologous promoters when using the JASPARTOP50 collection was 25.41
(see Table 2). In contrast, the score of the TF-map alignments between non-related promoters was 9.91. The sites
in the alignments involving non-orthologous gene promoters may correspond to general regulatory elements
present in most core promoters of our dataset.
To validate this hypothesis, we have analyzed the composition of the TF-map alignments of non-orthologous gene
promoters. We have detected an enrichment in TATA and
CAAT boxes (20% and 10% of the aligned sites, respectively), which are well known to be part of core promoters. Such a bias is not observed in the composition of the
alignments of the coding sequences of unrelated genes.
These alignments are therefore partially capturing common regulatory elements present in unrelated gene promoters of our dataset. In addition, we also found an
overrepresentation (25% of the aligned sites) of TFs
mainly expressed in the liver (HNF3, COUP-TF, HNF1).
Such a trend is not detected in the composition of the
alignments of the coding sequences of non-related genes.
This enrichment correlates well with the composition of
the HRCZ SET, which contains experimental regulatory
annotations from liver-specific genes (e.g. [36] and [37];
see [9] for further details).
We have performed an additional test to assess the significance of the scores of the MMAs. The previous tests have
involved alignments of orthologous gene regions of the
same type (e.g. four promoters or four coding segments).
We have compared now the score of the MMAs among
orthologous promoters of the same gene in the HRCZ SET
with the scores of the alignments of the same maps in
which one TF-map was randomly substituted by the TFmap of another segment of the same gene (denoted in
Table 3 as PPPS, where P is a promoter map and S is any
gene region: Coding, Promoter, Intronic, 5'UTR, 3'UTR,
intergenic, downstream).
Results appear in Table 3. The average score of MMAs
exclusively constituted by promoter maps was 25.41 (PPP
+ Promoter in Table 3). Indeed, the average score of the

TF-map and sequence alignments (CLUSTALW [5], MLAGAN [31], FOOTPRINTER [32]) of different genomic regions between the human, mouse,
chicken and zebrafish orthologous promoters in the HRCZ SET. TOP1 is the number of genes in which the highest scoring alignment is found in a
given genomic region. The MMA results were obtained with the optimal configuration α = 1; λ = 0.3; μ = 0.1; γ = 2.

MMAs involving only promoter maps was more than 60%
higher than alignments in which one of them was substituted by another gene region map (e.g. 10.06 for PPP +
Coding in Table 3). The average score of such alignments
dropped even more when a second substitution was permitted (see Table 3).

above, to measure their accuracy to detect the TFBSs experimentally annotated on these promoters.
Actin α-cardiac gene
Actins are highly conserved proteins that are involved in
various types of cell motility. The alpha actins are found
in muscle tissues and are a major constituent of the contractile apparatus. The Actin α-cardiac gene has been identified in many kinds of cells including muscle, where it is
a major constituent of the thin filament, and platelets
[38].

Finally, we analyzed the scores of pairwise TF-map alignments between each human promoter in the HRCZ SET
(PH) and the corresponding orthologous gene regions (SR)
in mouse. The average score of the TF-map alignments
involving the two promoters was substantially higher
(42.00) than any other incorrect combination (e.g. 5.80
for human promoter-mouse coding region alignments).
These results show that orthologous promoter-promoter
TF-map alignments are more significant than alignments
of any other combination of gene region maps.

The promoter of the human and mouse Actin α-cardiac
genes (ACTC, GenBank: M13483, M26773) has been
extensively characterized by experimental means [39]. In
the ABS database [13], the entry A0028 includes the
known orthologous binding sites in the respective human
and mouse promoters (500 nucleotides, the position
+501 is the TSS). The human ACTC promoter is constituted of three SRF sites (+301, +352, +392), a SP1 site
(+418), and a TATA box (+469).

Promoter characterization
We have selected three particular examples that show the
ability of MMAs to characterize promoter regions in the
absence of sequence conservation. In all cases, we have
compared the multiple TF-map alignment to the corresponding multiple sequence alignments, as in the section

Using the RefSeq gene annotations [28], we have also
identified the corresponding orthologous promoters in

the four ACTC promoters (see the alignments in the Supplementary Information).

We have then aligned the four promoters and compared
the resulting MMA with the functional annotations in the
ABS database. In general, the multiple TF-map alignment
of the four orthologous promoters of ACTC contains
many of the known functional sites in human and mouse,
detecting as well the corresponding orthologs in the other
species.

Myoglobin gene
The Myoglobin gene is a member of the globin superfamily
and is expressed in skeletal and cardiac muscles. The
encoded protein is an haemoprotein contributing to intracellular oxygen storage and transcellular facilitated diffusion of oxygen [40].

The MMA of the ACTC promoters and the experimental
evidence are shown in Figure 8 (top). While the region
proximal to the TSS is not more dense in predicted TFBSs
than other regions, most of the aligned elements cluster
next to the near TSS. In addition, the alignment agrees
well with the functional annotation available in human
and mouse, providing novel orthologous sites in chicken
and zebrafish:
1. The second SRF binding site is correctly identified in
human, mouse and also in zebrafish.
2. A RREB-1 site that overlaps the SP-1 active site is identified in the MMA. RREB-1 and SP-1 are members of the
zinc finger protein family with different binding specificities. However, the consensus of both matrices in JASPAR
are very similar, being constituted of several occurrences
of the motif CCCC [14].
3. A SQUA site that overlaps the third SRF active site is
identified in the MMA. SQUA and SRF are both members
of the MADS family [14].

The promoter of the Myoglobin gene in human (MB, GenBank: X00371) and in mouse (RefSeq: NM_013593) has
been experimentally characterized [39,41]. In the ABS
database [13], the entry A0037 includes the known
orthologous binding sites in the respective human and
mouse promoters (500 nucleotides, the position +501 is
the TSS). The human MB promoter is constituted of a
CCAC box (+272), a MEF-2 site (+335) with two surrounding E-boxes (+326, +348) and a TATA box (+469).
Using the RefSeq gene annotations [28], we have also
identified the corresponding orthologous promoters in
chicken
and
zebrafish
(RefSeq:
NM_203377,
NM_200586).
We have then aligned the four promoters and compared
the resulting MMA with the functional annotations
detailed above. The multiple TF-map alignment of the
four orthologous promoters of MB contains several of the
functional sites in human and mouse, detecting some of
the orthologs in the other two species. The output coverage is again very small.

5. The TATA box is correctly detected in human, mouse
and zebrafish as well.

The MMA of the MB promoters and the experimental evidence are shown in Figure 8 (bottom). Most of the aligned
elements are present next to the TSS, while this spatial
trend is not observable in the predictions at each promoter. The alignment also contains several of the functional human and mouse sites, providing their
counterparts in chicken and zebrafish:

No significant conservation among the sequences was,

sus in JASPAR represents an A/C rich area that contains the
CCAC motif [14].
2. The TATA box is correctly detected in the four species.
The multiple sequence alignment of the four MP promoters did not reveal any significant conservation (see the
alignments in the Supplementary Information).
Even-skipped stripe 2 enhancer
Proximal promoters are adjacent to the gene. Enhancers,
however, are other type of regulatory regions (typically
500 – 1,000 nucleotides long) positioned several kilobases upstream or downstream of the regulated gene.
Such elements can function in either orientation, being
distance and position independent [42]. The regulatory
logic of enhancers is different from the promoters, allowing a great plasticity in the arrangement of the TFBSs (e.g.
non-collinearity [22]). Enhancers are constituted of multiple binding sites to recruit four or five different TFs that
define space and time specific aspects of gene expression
[43]).

The body patterning of early embryo in Drosophila is governed by a hierarchy of maternal and zygotic genes. In particular, maternal and gap gene factors together control
pair rule gene expression in 7 alternating stripes, which in
turn regulate segment polarity and homeotic gene expression in 14 stripes [44]. The stripe 2 enhancer of the pairrule gene Even-skipped has been experimentally characterized in several species of Drosophila, showing considerable
evolutionary change in the binding site composition and
spacing [45]. Such annotations have been extensively
used to train several computational regulatory module
prediction approaches [46-48].
The stripe 2 enhancer of the Even-skipped gene (EVE, GenBank: AF042709 (D. melanogaster), AF042710 (D.
yakuba), AF042711 (D. erecta), AF042712 (D. pseudoobscura)) is governed by 17 TFBSs of four TFs [45]: 2 activators (bicoid and hunchback) and 2 repressors (giant and
Kruppel). We have obtained from TRANSFAC 8.4 [16] the
PWMs to recognize bicoid (I$BCD_01), hunchback
(I$HB_01) and Kruppel sites (I$KR_01). We will focus
therefore only on the occurrences for these three TFs. The
positions of the experimentally verified binding sites in
the Drosophila melanogaster enhancer are [45]: bicoid
(+138, +159, +310, +403, +521), hunchback (+496, +578,
+661) and Kruppel (+3, +139, +327, +521, +571, +615).
We have obtained the TF-maps of bicoid, hunchback and
Kruppel in these enhancers (threshold score 50%). We
have then aligned the four enhancer maps allowing noncollinear rearrangement in the alignments (parameter c =
1, see Section Non-collinear TF-map alignments). We
have compared the resulting MMA with the available

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/138

functional annotations. Matches to one of the elements in
overlapping sites for activators/repressors are considered
to be correct. The MMA of the four orthologous enhancers
and the experimental evidence are shown in Figure 9.
Despite we trained our algorithm specifically on humanmouse-chicken-zebrafish genes (vertebrates), the MMA of
the four Drosophila enhancers still agrees well with the regulatory annotation available for Drosophila melanogaster,
providing the orthologous known sites in the other species and two additional putative non-collinear rearrangements (see Figure 9):
1. Five out of six known Kruppel sites are correctly identified in the four enhancers.
2. Three out of five known bicoid sites are identified in the
four enhancers.
3. Two out of the three hunchback sites are identified.
The MMA contains a non-collinear rearrangement
between the HB1 site and the KR1 site in D. erecta (see Figure 9). The HB1 site is not detected in D. erecta and D.
pseudoobscura in the conventional sequence alignment of
the four enhancers [45]. Non-collinearity is also observed
between the BC2 site and a hypothetical Kruppel site predicted in D. pseudoobscura.

Discussion
Among the many codes that shape the sequence of the
genomes, the one regulating their transcriptional activity
remains remarkably elusive. Indeed, it is usually impossible to infer the specific spatial and temporal expression
pattern of a given genomic locus simply from the analysis
of the sequences presumably involved in its regulation. It
is well known that the initiation of the transcription by
RNA Polymerase II requires the interaction between this
enzyme and a number of TFs that bind to the DNA
sequence in the promoter region upstream of the transcription initiation site. While transcription factors bind
short DNA motifs on the promoter region, these motifs
are often degenerated, and their effective recognition by
the factors is dependent on the structural conformation of
the region harboring them.
As a result of these and other circumstances, the relation
between primary sequence and regulatory code is far from
being trivial. Indeed, recent genome-wide studies based
on chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of DNA
bound by promoter-associated proteins, followed by
either direct sequencing of the bound region or hybridization in a tiling array (ChIP-chip [49-51]) underlined the
complexity of this relationship. Often no occupancy by a
given TF has been experimentally detected for many

genomic sites where binding motifs can be computationally predicted [52,53]. Therefore, promoter regions of
genes sharing similar expression programs often do not
show nucleotide sequence conservation.
To overcome this limitation, we introduced recently a
novel approach based on abstracting the nucleotide
sequence of gene promoters and replacing it by a
sequence of labels, each label denoting, at a specific location on the primary sequence, the TF for which a known
binding site has been predicted. We used the term TFmaps for denoting such sequences of labels [9]. Pairwise
alignments between TF-maps can occasionally reveal
underlying configurations of TFBSs shared by co-regu-

lated genes, which escape detection by typical nucleotide
sequence comparisons.
Here, we introduce the multiple TF-map alignments. Multiple comparisons increase the power to detect the underlying features common across the compared elements by
increasing the signal to noise ratio. Multiple sequence
comparisons, in particular, have been used to identify regulatory motifs and coding exons in genomic sequences
[54,55]. The rationale is that since the probability of
mutation is lower in functional than in non-functional
regions, by increasing the number of sequences in the
comparisons, nucleotide divergence increases in nonfunctional regions proportionally more than in functional
ones, producing a sharper contrast in the sequence conser-

BMC Bioinformatics 2007, 8:138

vation landscape [56,57]. A similar rationale can be
applied to the multiple-TF map alignments. TF-maps,
obtained usually through computational predictions of
binding sites, contain many non-functional elements (i.e.
false positive hits). One expects that, among multiple TFmaps corresponding to genes with similar expression patterns, only the functional elements (i.e. the "bona fide"
TFBSs) will be conserved.
Indeed, as we have shown, the main effect of the multiple
map alignments (MMA) is the dramatic reduction in the
number of predicted TFBSs that typically result after a
PWM-based search (see Figure 8). For instance, we aligned
157 human sites to 197 mouse sites, 229 chicken sites and
167 zebrafish sites mapped in the respective Actin α-cardiac gene promoter orthologs. The resulting multiple TFmap alignment included only 14 TFBSs, which approximately represents a 13-fold reduction. In addition, most
aligned sites in the MMAs are concentrated in the proximal promoter region of each gene (200 nucleotides
upstream of the TSS). This gain in specificity is not simply
due to the selection of an arbitrary set of non-overlapping
TFBSs, since many experimentally annotated TFBSs on
these promoters are successfully covered by the resulting
MMAs.
We have trained our approach on a human-mousechicken-zebrafish dataset mostly constituted of tissue-specific genes, because of the enrichment of such a promoter
class in the regulatory annotation literature [36,39]. A
recent study states, however, that the classical TATA-box
promoter architecture of such genes represents a minority
of the set of mammalian promoters in human and mouse
[58]. The structure of TATA-independent promoters
occurring within a CpG island is more flexible and evolvable. We consider, however, the evaluation of the MMA
presented here is still correct as our approach does not distinguish the TATA-box and the other core promoter elements from the rest of TFs during the alignment. MMAs
can therefore also deal with flexible regulatory rearrangements (see the TF-map characterization of the Even-skipped
stripe 2 enhancer). In addition, in a previous study the TFmap alignments showed to be also effective in more general regulatory datasets that contained both classes of promoters [9]. Map alignments were introduced in the early
1980s to compare restriction enzyme maps [59]. Several
improvements on the basic pairwise algorithm were
developed since then [60] but this is the first time a multiple alignment implementation is proposed. In practice,
guaranteeing the optimal solution to the multiple
sequence comparison problem is difficult. Our approach
is based on the progressive alignment paradigm, which
produces not necessarily optimal alignments despite the
results are biologically meaningful [4]. Here we have generalized the data structures and algorithms shown in a

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/8/138

previous work for the pairwise comparison [9], to deal
with multiple maps without adding supplementary complexity. Thus, the cost of the final implementation is proportional to the number of pairwise comparisons
performed by the progressive approach.
In addition, we have redefined the way in which the
dynamic programming matrix is processed in order to
capture non-collinear configurations in the maps of regulatory elements. We have shown an example in which
non-collinearity helps to find rearrangements of TFBSs
that can not be detected using a conventional linear
approach. Despite it is actually very difficult to train the
non-collinear algorithm due to the lack of abundant
experimental annotations, we believe this kind of
approach will be very important in the future as collinearity can not be always assumed in regulatory regions [12].
The TF-map alignments are able to unveil characteristic
regulatory patterns that are difficult to be detected at the
sequence level. To test this hypothesis, we have used collections of position weight matrices as external mapping
functions. However, the TF-map alignment algorithm can
also deal with other kind of regulatory maps as those produced by pattern discovery programs. For instance, we
have used the MEME program [17] to discover novel
motifs (number of motifs: 20, minimum site length: 6,
maximum site length:15) in the promoters of the Actin αcardiac and Myoglobin genes. We have then performed the
MMA of such patterns. The input motifs and the resulting
alignment in both cases are shown in Figure 10. Such an
approach can be useful to enrich the results obtained
when the same promoters are aligned using JASPAR (see
Figure 8).
While here we have focused on TF-maps, the algorithms
and software that we have developed can also be applied,
in principle, to any other problem in which the primary
sequence can be annotated with higher-order features
(that is, it can be mapped into a sequence of labels denoting these features). Thus, comparisons between the annotations (instead of primary sequences) can reveal more
biological clues. Examples could include comparisons
between exons/introns that have been annotated with
matches to binding motifs for splicing regulatory factors
[61]. The MMAs, in this case, could reveal classes of exons
whose splicing is regulated in a similar way. Or comparisons between protein sequences which have been annotated with functional (PFAM, [62]) or structural domains.
The MMAs could help here to infer functional super-families. Or comparisons between entire genomes, which
have been annotated with the biological functions (for
instance, using Gene Ontology (GO) terms [63] of the
genes across the genomes). The MMAs could help to

Conclusion
In general, as the functionality of the primary sequence
becomes better understood, more innovative alignment
techniques between higher-order representations of the
sequences, such as the approach we presented here, will
become increasingly useful to uncover the features that
underlie common functionality.
