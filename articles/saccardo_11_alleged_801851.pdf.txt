On the alleged origin of geminiviruses from
extrachromosomal DNAs of phytoplasmas
Federica Saccardo1, Emanuele Cettul1, Sabrina Palmano2, Emanuela Noris2 and Giuseppe Firrao1,3*

Abstract
Background: Several phytoplasmas, wall-less phloem limited plant pathogenic bacteria, have been shown to
contain extrachromosomal DNA (EcDNA) molecules encoding a replication associated protein (Rep) similar to that
of geminiviruses, a major group of single stranded (ss) DNA plant viruses. On the basis of that observation and of
structural similarities between the capsid proteins of geminiviruses and the Satellite tobacco necrosis virus, it has
been recently proposed that geminiviruses evolved from phytoplasmal EcDNAs by acquiring a capsid protein
coding gene from a co-invading plant RNA virus.
Results: Here we show that this hypothesis has to be rejected because (i) the EcDNA encoded Rep is not of
phytoplasmal origin but has been acquired by phytoplasmas through horizontal transfer from a geminivirus or its
ancestor; and (ii) the evolution of geminivirus capsid protein in land plants implies missing links, while the analysis
of metagenomic data suggests an alternative scenario implying a more ancient evolution in marine environments.
Conclusion: The hypothesis of geminiviruses evolving in plants from DNA molecules of phytoplasma origin
contrasts with other findings. An alternative scenario concerning the origin and spread of Rep coding
phytoplasmal EcDNA is presented and its implications on the epidemiology of phytoplasmas are discussed.

Background
Geminiviruses are a large group of plant viruses causing
several important diseases worldwide, characterized by a
nucleic acid genome encapsidated into twinned particles
formed by joining two incomplete icosahedra. Geminiviruses differ from most other plant viruses in the fact
that they are single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses that
multiply through rolling circle replication (RCR). They
constitute one of the three recognized groups of episomal replicons that use RCR, the other being circular
ssDNA bacteriophages, and plasmids of bacteria or
archaea [1]. In a seminal paper Koonin and Ilyina [2]
found weak similarities between the replication associated protein (Rep) of geminiviruses and that of the
pLS1 family of plasmids of Gram positive bacteria.
Despite the limited similarity, the conservation of motif
signatures and of the spacing between them led to the
conclusion that they constitute a distinct superfamily.
On this basis Koonin and Ilyina [2] advanced the

hypothesis that geminiviruses may have actually originated from bacterial plasmids.
In the late 1990s, sequences with a relatively high
similarity to Rep were found in some extrachromosomal
DNA molecules (EcDNA) borne by a group of phytoplasmas related to the Western-X disease phytoplasma
[3], and then in the EcDNAs of several other phytoplasmas [4-9]. Phytoplasmas are plant pathogenic Mollicutes, wall-less prokaryotes taxonomically related to the
Clostridium/Bacillus clade of low G+C Gram positive
bacteria. They share with geminiviruses the characteristic of inhabiting the plant phloem and being transmitted
from plant to plant by defined groups of insect vectors.
The similarity of replication associated protein of phytoplasma EcDNAs and geminiviruses has been a matter
for discussion among plant pathologists over the last ten
years [10,11].
On the basis of similarities among replication associated proteins and comparative homology-based structural modeling of viral capsid proteins, Krupovic and
coworkers [12] recently proposed “a plasmid-to-virus
transition scenario, where a phytoplasmal plasmid
acquired a capsid-coding gene from a plant RNA virus

to give rise to the ancestor of geminiviruses”. Here we
report some new experimental data, homology searches
and phylogenetic analysis that, together with the results
of previous research, conclusively show that this,
although fascinating, hypothesis is too simplistic and
other possible scenarios are more likely.

Methods
Plant sources

Phytoplasma strains were maintained in a greenhouse
by graft-transmission to healthy Catharanthus roseus.
The phytoplasma strains used in this work and their
origin are listed in Additional File 1. Nucleic acids
from healthy and infected periwinkle plants were isolated using a standard phytoplasma enrichment procedure [13].
DNA/Protein sequence sources and analysis

The sequence data used in this work relative to 16S
rDNA and single stranded DNA binding (SSB) proteins
of various bacteria, plasmid replication protein (rep),
phytoplasmal EcDNAs, virus capsid and replication
associated proteins, as well as environmental DNA were
retrieved from the EMBL database and the community
cyberinfrastructure for advanced marine microbial ecology research and analysis (CAMERA, http://camera.
calit2.net). The complete EcDNA sequence of New Jersey Aster Yellows (NJAY) phytoplasma was determined
in this study. Sequence accessions, genes, organism
names, reference databases and labels used in the figures
are listed in Additional File 2.
Multiple sequence alignments of 16S rRNA genes, rep
and SSB were performed separately using MEGA4 [14].
For rep, the helicase domain was excluded and the
alignment was restricted to the replication initiator
domain (N-terminal region of about 150-180 aa).
Phylogenetic analysis using parsimony was carried out
with the PHYLIP package using the programs SEQBOOT, PROTPAR, DNAPARS and CONSENSE[15].
Bootstrapping with 500 replicates was performed to estimate the stability and support for the interfered clades.
Percent identity and similarity of phytoplasmal
EcDNA borne proteins and capsid proteins with other
database accessions were calculated using NEEDLE[16],
launched recursively with a BIOPERL script when
needed. Principal coordinates analysis was carried out
with R [17]. The likelihood-ratio test for monophyly
[18] was carried out with a selection of 14 sequences
taking a null hypothesis that the Rep of type II EcDNAs,
the rep of type I EcDNA and RCR plasmids are a group
while the Rep of geminiviruses are another. Likelihoods
were estimated with PHANGRON[19]. The significance
of the likelihood ratio was estimated by parametric
bootstrap according to [18] by simulation of 1000

replicated datasets generated with INDEL-SEQ-GEN
[20]. Tetranucleotide usage patterns were compared
with the program TETRA[21].
NJAY phytoplasma EcDNA amplification and sequence
analysis

Degenerate primer sets (Additional File 3) were
designed on conserved EcDNA regions deduced from
sequences available from the EMBL database, to PCR
amplify the replication associated protein of the EcDNA
of “Candidatus Phytoplasma asteris” strain NJAY. Purified PCR products were sequenced and the entire
EcDNA of NJAY phytoplasma was sequenced by primer
walking using newly designed primers (see Additional
File 3).
Amplifications were performed in a 20-μl PCR reaction containing 100 ng of template DNA, 200 μM
dNTPs, 1 μM of each primer, 1 U of 5 PRIME DNA
polymerase with the recommended PCR buffer containing MgCl2 (5 PRIME, Hamburg, Germany). PCR was
carried out with an automated thermal cycler (T-Professional Basic, Biometra, Germany). The reactions
included an initial denaturation cycle at 94°C for 2 min,
then 30 cycles of 94°C for 20 sec, 53°C for 20 sec and
72°C for 3 min. At the end, the reaction mixtures were
incubated at 72°C for 10 min and then stored at 4°C.
The DNA fragments were sequenced by standard
methods and assembled manually using BIOEDIT 7.0.0
(Tom Hall, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Open reading frames
were predicted using ORF FINDER (NCBI, http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html), using the standard
genetic code. Homologous sequences were identified
from the GenBank database using the BLASTX programme (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi).

Results and Discussion
The origin of the phytoplasmal Rep is not bacterial

During the last 20 years, studies on phytoplasmal DNA
showed that there are 3 types of phytoplasmal EcDNAs,
according to DNA sequence similarity analysis. While in
the most recently discovered type of EcDNAs replication
is initiated by a DNA primase encoded by dnaG, type I
and type II EcDNAs replicate through an RCR mechanism assisted by an EcDNA encoded replication associate
protein. Type I molecules include a gene encoding a
protein that is phylogenetically related to the replication
associated protein (rep) of RCR plasmids of the pLS1
family [22]. Plasmids of this family (PFAM accession:
PF01719) have been found in a wide range of Gram
positive bacteria, including members of the class Mollicutes. Phytoplasma plasmids differ from other plasmids
of the pLS1 family in having a C-terminal region (100
aa) that was related to the reps of circoviruses and the
helicases of picorna-like viruses [23]. According to the

Saccardo et al. BMC Evolutionary Biology 2011, 11:185
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/185

analysis carried out by Gibbs and coworkers [24] this
feature is shared with rep encoded by genes belonging
to other RCR bacterial plasmids or integrated into the
genome of various organisms, such as Entamoeba histolytica and Lactobacillus acidophilus. A phylogenetic analysis of the replication associated domain of reps of

representatives of the known RCR plasmid families (Figure 1) shows that sequences from different “Candidatus
Phytoplasma” species are related among themselves and
also with sequences from organisms belonging to the
low GC branch of Gram positives bacteria, forming a
distinct branch of the pLS1 family.

Despite the fact that type II EcDNA also replicates
through a RCR mechanism [4,25], they encode a protein
which is not related to the rep of pLS1, but rather to
geminivirus replication associated protein Rep (PFAM
accession: PF00799). As noticed earlier, replication associated proteins of viral RCR replicons have no significant similarity with those encoded by plasmid RCR
replicons and, as shown in the principal coordinates
plot of the pairwise distances of Figure 2, they are a well
distinct group of proteins. The phytoplasmal Rep are
within the group of viral replicons in Figure 2 as they
share high similarity with viral Rep and low similarity
with plasmid rep. While there is a high degree of conservation among the replication associated proteins of
the same EcDNA type, the rep of type I EcDNA and the
Rep of type II EcDNA share modest sequence similarity.
To provide statistical evidence that the Rep of type II
EcDNA are not phylogenetically related with the rep of
the type I EcDNAs (the true plasmids of the phytoplasmas), we carried out a test for monophyly [18] that evaluated by parametric bootstrap the significance of the
likelihood ratio of a null hypothesis with the constraint
that Rep and rep are monophyletic relative to the
unconstrained maximum likelihood tree (Figure 3). The
log likelihoods of the null hypothesis and the unconstrained tree resulted -11327.01 and -11264.55,

respectively and their ratio (delta = 124.9270) was compared with the delta distribution in a set of alignments
of simulated sequences evolved in silico using the
unconstrained tree as guidance. The largest delta of a
set of 500 alignments was 68.13182 and therefore the
null hypothesis is to be rejected (P << 0.002). According
to a published phylogenetic analysis of phytoplasmal
Rep that placed them as a distinct group within the
geminivirus Rep clade [12] and due to the failure to find
any ancestor or relative for Rep among bacterial
sequences, we conclude that the Rep of type II EcDNA
of phytoplasmas are viral and not bacterial sequences,
despite the fact that they have been found associated
with bacterial organisms.
What then are type II EcDNA of phytoplasmas?

In order to clarify the origin of type II EcDNAs, we
investigated the additional sequences that are part of
these replicons. By reviewing the results of Southern
blot analyses carried out in our laboratories on DNA
extracted from our collection of phytoplasmas using Rep
sequences as probes, we identified a minimal-sized type
II EcDNA in “Ca. P. asteris”, strain New Jersey Aster
Yellows. This 2,400 bp-long EcDNA was cloned and
sequenced and was shown to include a Rep gene, a gene
encoding a ssDNA binding protein (SSB) and a non
coding region about 900 bp in length (Figure 4). Database analysis confirmed that a gene for a SSB protein is
encoded by all type I and type II phytoplasma EcDNAs
sequenced so far, with the exception of three EcDNAs
of “Candidatus Phytoplasma australiense” (that however
has some putative chromosome encoded phage derived
SSBs) and two EcDNAs that were isolated from strains
that contain multiple different EcDNAs. It is well
assessed that RCR replication needs the assistance of a
helicase and a SSB protein [1]. We tested whether or
not a common origin of the genes putatively necessary
for type II EcDNA replication, Rep and SSB, was supported by congruence in their phylogenies. The phylogeny of the SSB protein obtained for type II EcDNA
was not congruent with that of the Rep of type II
EcDNA, but rather with that of the rep of type I
EcDNA: as shown in Figure 5a, the SSB proteins of both
type I and type II EcDNAs are similar and related to the
orthologous proteins of bacteria belonging to the low
GC branch of Gram positives. Moreover the phylogeny
of the SSB coding gene in phytoplasmal EcDNAs is
similar to that of the 16S rDNA of phytoplasmas (Figure
5b). Most other ORFs borne by phytoplasmal EcDNAs
can also be phylogenetically tracked to Gram positive
bacteria and are highly similar between type I and type
II EcDNAs. Figure 6 illustrates the composition of four
EcDNAs, two of type I and two of type II, that are the
complete EcDNA set of “Ca. P. asteris” strain AYWB.

EcDNA sequenced in this study. The first nucleotide of Rep is
designated as position 1. The arrows indicate the putative ORFs
and their direction of transcription. The DNA region
corresponding to a remnant part of ORF3 in the non coding
region is delimited and expanded on the top of the figure
showing the potential translated sequence aligned to part of
ORF3 in the EcDNA of the Onion Yellows phytoplasma
(accession AB479514.1).

Each EcDNA encodes ORFs that are highly similar to
their homologs in all other EcDNAs, except for those
encoding the replication associated proteins; in fact the
EcDNAs AYWB-pI and AYWB-pIII encode Rep, while
AYWB-pII and AYWB-pIV encode rep. In synthesis, the
phylogenetic analysis of SSB and the comparisons
reported in figure 6 show that the phytoplasmal EcDNAs are strictly related replicons that share among each
other sequences typical of Gram positive bacteria, while
type II EcDNA have a replication associated protein that
is not typical of Gram positive bacteria. As DNA regions
with conflicting phylogenetic signals reflect incongruent
genes histories due to recombination [26], this observation suggests that type II EcDNAs acquired a Rep gene
through recombination. We then compared the tetranucleotide patterns used in the genes rep and Rep with
those of the other coding sequences in the four EcDNAs
of “Ca. P. asteris” strain AYWB. According to the
results shown in figure 7 there is no correlation between
the teranucleotide patterns used in Rep and the rest of
the DNA sequences of the type I or type II EcDNAs,
confirming that Rep did not co-evolve with the rest of
the EcDNA replicons, including rep. Thus, according to
the gene organization and nucleotide patterns, type II
EcDNAs appear to be plasmids that have lost their rep
and acquired an unrelated Rep, as a likely gain through
horizontal gene transfer. The high level of sequence

values.

conservation shared by ORFs of type I and type II EcDNAs suggests that this gain was a relatively recent event.
In conclusion, evidences from replication associated
protein similarity and EcDNA gene organization and
composition show that the sequence similarity between
the Rep genes of geminiviruses and phytoplasmas do
not link geminiviruses to RCR plasmids of Gram positive bacteria, rather they indicate the existence in phytoplasmas of recombinant replicons containing a Rep with
a different phylogenetic history from their host bacteria,
presumably horizontally acquired from geminiviruses, i.
e. viruses that share the same niche of phytoplasmas
being insect transmitted and inhabiting the plant
phloem.
The elusive donor of the coat protein genes

In an attempt to define the origin of the geminivirus
capsid, Krupovic and coworkers [12] hypothesized that

phytoplasmal “plasmids” released upon lysis of the bacterial cell in the cytoplasm of the host plant cell
obtained a coat protein (CP) coding gene from an
unknown plant virus. Through modeling of the geminiviral CP Krupovic and coworkers [12] found that it fits
the eight-stranded b-barrel folding model, like all isometric ssRNA plant viruses and several DNA viruses.
Among viruses for which a 3D structure is available, the
Satellite tobacco necrosis virus (STNV) was found, with
a significant score, to be a suitable template for structural modeling of geminiviral CPs, as was also earlier
reported in [27,28]. Krupovic and coworkers [12] constructed 3D models of geminiviral CPs and tested the
stereochemical quality along with the X-ray structure of
the STNV CP. In addition, they found similarity in the
primary amino acid sequence between geminiviruses
and STNV in a structure-based sequence alignment. On
this basis they hypothesized that a phytoplasma

AYWB. Genes with the same colour share more than 60% similarity in their putatively coded protein. EcDNA sequences were obtained in [4].

“plasmid” may have recruited, through RNA/DNA
recombination, the genetic information of a capsid protein from an icosahedral ssRNA virus similar to STNV
resulting in the development of virions composed of
two incomplete icosahedra large enough to accommodate its genome.
In assessing the strength of this hypothesis, it is
important to stress that the virus capsid not only has
the role of accommodating the viral genome, but also
determines characteristics of transmission and infection
of the virion. The Geminiviridae family is subdivided
into four genera on the basis of their infection and genome characteristics [29]. Mastreviruses are transmitted
by leafhoppers and have a single monopartite genome
component. Members of the genus Mastrevirus have
been found only in Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia
where they infect monocots. Also Curtoviruses have
monopartite genomes and are transmitted by leafhoppers, but they infect dicot plants. Begomoviruses, including the vast majority of geminiviruses, are transmitted
by whiteflies, infect only dicots, and include species with
a bipartite or a monopartite genome. The fourth genus,
Topocuvirus, contains a single monopartite virus

transmitted by treehoppers and appears to be a relatively recent result of a recombination between mastreviruses and begomoviruses [30]. The coat protein of
geminiviruses is a determinant of vector transmission by
either whiteflies or leafhoppers [31]. It has been shown
by mutational analysis that the ability to be transmitted
is determined by characteristics of the virion capsid
[32,33]. In the hypothesis of Krupovic and coworkers
[12], a parsimonious scenario should consider as suitable
CP gene donor candidates viruses that not only have the
same shape, but also share the same niche and confer
similar transmission characteristics. It is relevant to
mention that geminiviruses genome replicates in the
nucleus (as it would a putative DNA plasmid ancestor),
while most plant RNA viruses (including STNV) only
invade the cytoplasm; the presence of the putative CP
donor virus in a different cellular compartment would
not favor genome recombination, and particularly the
rare DNA-RNA recombination events. With regard to
infection characteristics, CP donor candidates could be
leafhopper- or whitefly- transmitted phloem-inhabiting
viruses. However, as illustrated in Table 1, none of the
known RNA virus families with members transmitted by

leafhoppers or whiteflies share the structural characteristics of geminivirus, an issue that was taken as an indication of relatedness of their CPs by Krupovic and
coworkers [12]. Viruses of the genera Marafivirus and
Waikavirus have round isometric virions of about 30
nm, but with a T = 3 symmetry, which implies different
protein-protein interactions than those occurring in virions with T = 1 symmetry, such as geminiviruses. In
fact, our attempts to use these CPs as templates for
structural modeling of the geminivirus CPs did not produce significant scores, according to the Structure Prediction MetaServer [34] (not shown). Moreover,
although Marafivirus and Waikavirus are leafhopper
transmitted they do not share the protein motif highly
conserved in Mastrevirus that was shown to be relevant
for transmission [28], suggesting that the ability of mastreviruses to be transmitted by leafhoppers has evolved
independently from that of Marafivirus and Waikavirus.
With no suitable donor candidates among the known
leafhopper-or whitefly-transmitted viruses, a less parsimonious scenario has to be postulated to accommodate
the hypothesis of Krupovic and coworkers [12]: the
recruited CP gene conferred transmission characteristics
that were different from those of geminiviruses, but in a
later time a virus line evolved with infection characteristics and a niche that were, by pure chance, similar to
those of the original donors of the Rep gene, i.e. the
leafhopper-transmitted and phloem inhabiting phytoplasmas. This scenario would fit with STNV, that was
indicated by Krupovic and coworkers [12] as the most
closely related virus acting as a potential ancestor donor
of capsid genes. However, if STNV, a virus transmitted
by a fungus, was a donor of CP to the nascent geminivirus, then ssDNA viruses with a replication associated
protein similar to geminivirus Rep but with transmission
characteristics different from those of the present geminiviruses should have formed, a notion that contrasts
with the present knowledge of plant virus diversity.
Despite the great diversity of known plant viruses, a
non-geminivirus with Rep-like replication associated

protein has never been found. Therefore, the less parsimonious version of the hypothesis of Krupovic and coworkers implies a Geminiviridae ancestral virus taxon that
disappeared leaving no trace. On a contrasting line of
evidence, a recently discovered geminivirus-related DNA
mycovirus from the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum
(named SsHADV-1) [35] greatly differs in its CP from
those of geminiviruses and from that of STNV as well.
Here, we question that a poorly parsimonious hypothesis that also implies unlikely RNA/DNA recombination
could be accepted. Indeed, data obtained from recent
metagenomic studies suggest alternative hypothesis.
We conducted a BLASTP search in the EMBL
sequence database for similarity to geminivirus CPs
excluding the family Geminiviridae. We retrieved a protein encoded by a viral genome reconstructed by
Rosario and coworkers [36] through data-mining of
public viral metagenomes of reclaimed water (accession
C6GIH8) that showed 29% identity and 39% similarity
with the coat protein of the begomovirus Crotalaria
juncea virus (accession A1EBG8). Recent metagenomic
studies provide evidence of the existence of previously
unknown viral genera [36-38]; some of these novel viral
genomes similar to ssDNA circoviruses (a group of animal viruses) were found to have predicted CPs different
from known circovirus and more similar to geminivirus
CPs [36]. Searching the sequences derived from marine
environment metagenomic studies in datasets available
from the community cyberinfrastructure for advanced
marine microbial ecology research and analysis (CAMERA, website http://camera.calit2.net) by BLASTP we
found several sequences of likely viral origin that
showed significant similarity to geminivirus CPs. Table
2 shows that the similarity of some of these entries
retrieved with selected Geminiviridae CPs are comparable with those calculated between CPs of begomoviruses and mastreviruses (that range from 16 to 27%
identity and 27 to 46% similarity). According to Table 2,
there are sequences from marine environments that
appear to be better candidates than STNV for being

be excluded that such viruses are derivative rather than
ancestors of geminiviruses, our analysis show that geminivirus ancestors could have evolved their CP in marine
environments before their adaptation as pathogens of
land plants, and therefore their origin could be
explained without having recourse to unlikely and
poorly parsimonious scenarios.
In conclusion, although the origin of the geminivirus
CP cannot be determined with certainty, the origin from
a ssRNA virus such as SNTV appears to be unlikely
compared to other hypotheses on the basis of similarity
analysis, the absence of any remnant of a non-leafhopper/whitefly-transmitted plant virus encoding Rep, and
the requirement of a DNA/RNA recombination event in
incongruent cell compartments.
Given the evidence of a distant relationship between
the CPs of geminiviruses and STNV, a common origin
for both spherical and geminate virions with T = 1 icosahedral symmetry remains an interesting hypothesis;
the information reported here only shows that the idea
that the evolution from the common ancestor to the
present virions occurred in land plants is not sufficiently
supported. Several lines of evidence further indicate that
geminiviruses evolved earlier, from remote ancestors
existing 450 million years ago [39], and there is molecular evidence that begomoviruses and mastreviruses were
already differentiated at the time of the Gondwana
separation [40], i.e. before the phytoplasma phylogenetic
branch arose from the insect colonizing AAP (Acholeplasma - Anaeroplasma - Phytoplasma) lineage of Mollicutes (estimated as 180 million years in [41]). This
course of evolutionary events is also compatible with a
common origin of ssDNA viruses of plants, in agreement with the results gathered by Gibbs and Weiler
[42] who detected several traits in common between
geminiviruses and nanoviruses strongly suggesting their
common origin, a notion consistent with both the transmission characteristics and type of replication.

It is tempting to conclude that the apparent evolutionary isolation of geminiviruses deduced by the analysis of
RCR replicons in plants is only due to the limitation of
our narrow view on life diversity.
Filling the gaps: a hypothesis on the origin and success
of phytoplasmal type II EcDNA

Our results from sequence data analysis are consistent
with a recombination event between phytoplasma plasmids (type I EcDNAs) and the geminivirus genome giving rise to type II EcDNAs in phytoplasmas. Krupovic
and coworkers [12] have discarded this hypothesis
because geminiviruses “maintained features of prokaryotic replicons, such as typical bacterial promoter
sequences” and “are in some instances still able to replicate their DNA in bacterial cells”. It may be useful to
stress that a remote bacterial origin is definitely not in
contrast with a hypothesis of a more recent recombination event. There are also reasons to question the putative origin of geminivirus Rep from bacterial plasmids.
Kapitonov and Jurka [1] suggested that geminiviruses
might have evolved from plant RC transposons rather
than from prokaryotic RC replicons. Plant RC transposons (helitrons) encode their own helicase and SSB.
Moreover, some geminiviruses can replicate in the
Gram negative Agrobacterium tumefaciens [43], while,
to our knowledge, no RCR plasmid of the pLS1 family
has been reported to replicate in Gram negatives. In
addition, there is no evidence that geminivirus Rep is
functional in a bacterial background that support replication of RCR plasmids. We have tested the ability of
different constructs containing phytoplasmal Rep to
replicate in Bacillus subtilis. We inserted the entire
NJAY EcDNA into pJM103 (a pUC18 derivative that
can replicate in E. coli but not in B. subtilis and contains
a chloramphenicol resistance that is expressed in B. subtilis [44]), but found no evidence of replication of the
construct in B. subtilis (results not shown). Thus, the
replication in A. tumefaciens does not appear to be

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2148/11/185

strong evidence of a geminivirus relationship with RCR
plasmids.
The sequence of the complete genome of several phytoplasmas showed that these organisms have incomplete
nucleotide synthesis pathways and therefore depend on
their host for nucleotides [8,45,46]. No transport system
for nucleosides or nucleotides has been identified yet in
the phytoplasma genomes, and, since no information on
how they obtain the necessary nucleotides for replication
is available, uptake and recycling of nucleic acids from
the host plant may play a prominent role. It has also
been shown that phytoplasmas have a highly active
recombination system. Indeed, sequences similar to truncated geminivirus Rep have been found in the chromosome of several phytoplasmas. Thus, geminivirus DNA in
the phloem may have been readily available for internalization and incorporation into the phytoplasma chromosomal or extrachromosomal DNA by recombination.
Once acquired by recombination, the survival and
sequence conservation [3] of Rep in phytoplasmas may
derive from its contribution to the propagation and
spread of plasmid borne functions. Namba and coworkers [47] have highlighted the possible implication of
the phytoplasma plasmid borne ORF3 in determining
insect transmissibility and showed that a non-insecttrasmissible variant of the same phytoplasma strains
lacked ORF3. Thus, a plasmid encoded sequence may
have a relevant role in phytoplasma epidemiology.
According to our Southern blot analyses (not shown)
and other studies [46] no EcDNA was detected in phytoplasmas such as “Ca. P. mali”, “Ca. P. pyri”, “Ca. P.
vitis”, “Ca. P. prunorum” that are monophagous and
have a narrow insect vector range. Conversely EcDNAs
have been reported in strains of the polyphagous species
“Ca. P. asteris”, “Ca. P. australiense”, “Ca. P. pruni” and
“Ca. P. trifolii”, that are transmitted by a wider range of
insect vector species [3,5-9]. There are several reports
over the last 15 years of molecular analysis of phytoplasma diversity that indicate that the infection by two
or more polyphagous phytoplasmas is a common event
in herbaceous plants; besides, transmission of phytoplasma strains by different insect species has been found
to be the basis of epidemics and outbreaks of new diseases [48]. In this context, an EcDNA carrying ORF3
and propagating among polyphagous phytoplasmas possibly contributed to widen the insect vector range. Our
analysis of the untranslated region of NJAY phytoplasma
EcDNA revealed that it includes a remnant of ORF3
(figure 4). Since NJAY phytoplasma EcDNA, like several
other EcDNA sequences in the database, has been
obtained from a phytoplasma strain isolated in an
experimental host and propagated for many years by
graft transmission rather than insect vectoring, the
NJAY EcDNA could have initiated a process of

Page 10 of 12

reductive evolution, as recently reported [49], loosing a
functional ORF3. A search among other phytoplasmal
EcDNA sequences revealed that functional or incomplete ORF3 homologs are present in 19 out of the 30
EcDNAs fully sequenced so far.
The potential contribution in broadening insect vector
specificity by propagating ORF3 horizontally among
phytoplasmas may be the cause of the conservation of
EcDNAs, including type II EcDNAs that may have originated by recombination. Although a search for the
canonical nonanucleotide sequence in the untranslated
region of NJAY type II EcDNA was unsuccessful, we
detected a variant with 8 conserved nts (not shown); the
recent report that high-affinity Rep-binding is not
required for the replication of a geminivirus DNA [50]
gives ground to the hypothesis that, upon recombination, a geminivirus Rep may have functionally substituted rep in catalyzing the replication of DNA
sequences, representing a selective advantage for the
host organism. We may speculate that the propagation
and spread of ORF3 may have granted conservation of
both EcDNA types.
Since phytoplasmas belonging to some phylogenetic
clades do not have remnants of Rep that are conversely
common in other strains, the phytoplasma type II
EcDNA should have appeared after the separation of the
major phytoplasma clades, well after the appearance on
earth of vascular plants and probably the origin of
geminiviruses.

Conclusion
The data presented here explain the origin of phytoplasmal type II EcDNAs and support the rejection of
the hypothesis that geminiviruses evolved from phytoplasma plasmids, even though the evolutionary history
of geminiviruses remains to be clarified. Nevertheless,
in agreement with recent reviews on this topic [39], a
more in depth investigations of environments different
from higher plants is expected to provide sound
answers.
