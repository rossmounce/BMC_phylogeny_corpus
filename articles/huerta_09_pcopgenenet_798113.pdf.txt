Abstract
Background: Microarray technology is so expensive and powerful that it is essential to extract
maximum value from microarray data, specially from large-sample-series microarrays. Our web
tools attempt to respond to these researchers' needs by facilitating the possibility to test and
formulate from a hypothesis to entire models under a holistic point of view.
Results: PCOPGene-Net is a web application for facilitating the study of the relationships among
gene expressions under microarray conditions, to classify these conditions and to study their effect
on expression relationships. Furthermore, the system guides the researcher in the navigation
through the microarray data by providing the most suitable genes and information for the
researcher's interests at each moment. We achieve all of these by means of the zoom-out
operation, the zoom-in operation, the non-continuous analysis and crossing the PCOPGene results
with external data-servers.
Conclusion: PCOPGene-Net helps to identify cellular states and the genes involved in these. All
of that is accomplished in a flexible way, guided by the researcher's interests and taking advantage
of the ability of our system to relate gene expressions, even when these relationships are noncontinuous and cannot be found using linear or non-linear analytical methods. Currently, our tools
are used for tumour-progression study from a holistic point of view.

Background
Current biological research, and specially transcriptomics,
generates large amounts of data which researchers need to
analyse in order to understand the underlying process.
DNA microarray technology power lies in its ability to
provide data of a great number of gene expressions
throughout different sample conditions. There are several

relevant web applications for microarray analysis, i.e.,
GEO [1], BIOREL [2], ArrayExpress [3], MicroGen [4] and
GEPAS [5]. Currently, most tools try to extract biological
information from such high-throughput expression data
combining information from co-expressed genes [6] as
well as additional annotations extracted from Gene
Ontology (ADGO) [7], phylogenetic information

(CLANS)[8] or pathway data (MAPMAN) [9]. In this
paper, a new approach incorporating the detailed analysis
of the experiments' effect on the fluctuations of geneexpression relationships to the network analysis is proposed.
The microarray data sets can be provided by: a) temporal
series, useful to study synchronous cellular events, and b)
serial analysis of gene-expression samples under different
conditions (i.e., chemotherapy, temperature, radiation,
starvation, etc.) which are more useful for studying asynchronous events. The progressive increase of microarray
sample-series [10] motivates a more thorough analysis of
expression relationships and gene dependencies throughout these large series, trying to extract global gene behaviours, cellular states and phenotypes. Furthermore, the
large number of microarray genes involves genes belonging to very different processes and functions, thus leading
to a holistic perspective.
Our strategy to achieve this holistic perspective is to
develop several tools which facilitate a progressive analysis of microarrays data with large sample series, leading
the researcher from known marker genes, and progressively widen his/her scope analysis towards the holistic
perspective. This progressive analysis is based on four
approaches:
1. Analysis of linear gene-expression relationships.
2. Analysis of non-linear gene-expression relationships
and study of the fluctuations of this non-linearity.
3. Analysis of non-continuous gene-expression relationships.
4. Facilitating the navigation through the microarray data
based on: researcher interests, the continuous and noncontinuous relationships among gene expressions, and
the links among genes supplied by external biomedical
databases.
In this way, the tools to enable the progressive analysis are
provided.
For this purpose, several methods and tools have been
designed [11-13] and integrated in to the four basic operations of the PCOPGene-Net detailed below.

Methods
PCOP
The mathematics behind this system makes use of the
Principal Curves of Oriented-Points calculation (PCOP)
[14,15]. The Principal Curves is a non-linear and nonhypothesis-driven pattern-analysis technique.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/138

PCOP is defined by the generalisation, at the local level,
of the next principal-component property, which is: for a
normal multivariable distribution X, if X is projected over
the hyperplane, the total variance of the projection is minimised when the hyperplane is orthogonal to the first
principal component. In this way, the Principal Oriented
Points (POP) are found for each local area, and these local
principal-components vectors will be the tangent vectors
of the PCOP, the curve which goes through all of the POP.
In a previous work [14], it was described how to accurately
define these local areas in the global space and the samples belonging to each one. One of the main advantages
of PCOP over other methods is the generalisation of the
principal-components variance. The PCOP method provides a good measure of the data dispersion around the
curve and the capability of a good definition of the local
areas, both being very significant for our applications
[14].
Clustering the samples of each POP (the 'hidden-variabledependent' clustering)
Using the 'hidden-variable-dependent' clustering operation
[12], the user can select the different discretised states (the
POPs) obtained in the PCOP calculus. With this action,
the samples belonging to the POP local area are selected.
In this way, the user can separate the sample data in term
of their belonging to the different local behaviours of gene
expression relationships. This new clustering approach,
then, permits one to differentiate the samples belonging
to a continuous dataset on the basis of the non-explicit
reason (or hidden-variable role) of these local tendencies
of expression relationships. For more details about this
clustering method based on the fluctuations of the inner
pattern, consult our work [12].

In the same interface where the PCOP is shown (see
detailed view, Fig. 1 and 2), the samples can be clustered to
define the classes. Previously-defined classes can be coloured in the same interface to study their influence on
gene-expression relationships (Fig. 2).
Gene network, gene clusters, minimum-spanning tree, and
graph layout
The PCOP calculus provides two variance values: the Generalized Total Variance (GTV) and the Residual Variance
(RV). The Generalized Total Variance (GTV) is the variance explained by the curve and permits one to know if
the Principal Curve is able to follow the sample-cloud tendency. The Residual Variance (RV) is the variance not
explained by the Curve and describes the degree of dispersion of the samples around the Principal Curve. The Generalized Total Variance (GTV) is the sum of these two
dispersion parameters, and the f factor is the RV divided
by the GTV [15].

the showing of the minimum-spanning path among any
set of microarray genes. The minimum-spanning path is
necessary for the zoom-in operation, as it will be immediately following detailed.
Gene selection algorithm using the minimum-spanning
path
Considering that a query set of microarray genes introduced by the researcher maintains a certain level of correlation as a set (correlation level which the researcher does
not wish to lose), the researcher expects to obtain the
maximum number of microarray genes which connect the
genes of the query set in expression terms, but conserving
the correlation level of the query set in the new queryplus-selected-genes set.

Figure 1
The Detailed View (parametric plot)
The Detailed View (parametric plot). In the display is
shown the dependence relationship among the selected
genes. The ordinate axis indicates the expression level while
the abscissa indicates the parameter of the function that
describes the relationship. The lines represent the expression level of the compared genes for each point of the relationship. Selecting any point of the relationship, a sample
class is defined with the samples belonging to this relationship stretch. In the display, it is shown that ENO2 has an
expression phase and a non-expression phase, with respect
to the rest of the analysed genes.

This f value supplied by the PCOP calculus provides the
non-correlation factor and is used to know how many,
not exclusively linearly, sampled gene-expressions are
related. Once a microarray is uploaded to the server, the
PCOP between each pair of microarray genes is calculated.
Based on this, a minimum-spanning tree and a complete
graph is defined where its edges are the relationships
between each pair of genes for the corresponding f value.
In a previous work [13] is shown the benefit of using the
f value versus other correlation measurements to construct the gene network.
The Java JUNG libraries for analysis and visualization of
network data by web [16] have been used to mount the
interactive graph of the global vision interface (Fig. 3). On
the graph layout, the genes are placed in the 2D space
based on the correlation degree of each gene with its
neighbours, grouping the genes in clusters and facilitating

The selection algorithm selects the genes (nodes) of the
minimum-spanning tree which connect the query genes,
conforming the minimum-spanning path among them.
When a hierarchical clustering is built using a single linkage, we obtain a minimum-spanning tree where each edge
of the tree represents the relationship used to add each
new gene or cluster to the tree [17]. In this way, we can
apply these clusters, their hierarchy and the properties of
the hierarchical clustering to their corresponding minimum-spanning tree. And that involves that the minimum-spanning path always converges towards the pair of
genes and clusters best correlated among them, maximising the correlation degree of the supplied set of genes [13].
The gene selection algorithm using the minimum-spanning
path will be used in the zoom-in operation explained in the
next section.

Results
The web application is composed of two main graphical
interfaces: The global network view (Fig. 3) and the detailed
view (Fig. 1 and 2), some PHPs and CGIs and several databases. The final application provides four basic operations:
1. the zoom-out operation gives a global vision of the
interdependence among analysed-microarray gene
expressions.
2. At a given moment, the researcher wants to focus his/
her research on a concrete, process or on apparently
unconnected processes, to know what genes are involved
in it and to study their expressions dependence in detail.
This task is provided by the zoom-in operation.
3. However, a lot of genes are not continuously correlated
for all of their expression ranges. To analyse this kind of
non-continuous relationships, the non-continuous analysis
is provided.

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:138

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/138

Then, the system supplies the genes which link these gene
markers in expression terms and throughout the expression range of the genes (continuously). As was seen in the
Methods section (Gene selection algorithm using the minimum-spanning path), the correlation degree of the query set
is conserved in the new query-plus-supplied-genes set. This is
relevant for the final-view step.
Finally, in the detailed view, the dependence among the
expressions of the query-plus-supplied-genes set can be analysed. The fluctuations of this mentioned dependence are
shown in the graphical interface (Fig. 1).
Non-continuous analysis
There are a lot of non-continuous gene-expression relationships impossible to analyse with linear or not linear
methods. But furthermore, it can be interesting for the
researcher to study only part of a relationship (for
instance, from a x = y2 relation, only the region where
both genes are underexpressed), it starts a non-continuous
analysis.
First step: Define the classes
The sample classes can be defined from three ways:

Figure 2
The Detailed View (geometric plot)
The Detailed View (geometric plot). The expressions of
two genes are being compared in the display. Each axis represents the expression level of each gene, the data cloud represents the values of the microarray experiments [32] for
the compared genes, and the line represents the dependence
relationship between the gene expressions. The samples
belonging to different sample classes previously defined are
painted with different colours.

4. The number of samples of the analysed microarray are
limited and in addition, there are many more links among
genes besides the expression links. Remote data-bases will
be consulted to elaborate on the information.
The four operations are illustrated in Fig. 4 and explained
in detail below.
Zoom-out operation
The provides a global network vision with: The graph of
continuous relationships among gene expressions (for all
of the expression range), the gene clusters with the nodes
coloured by the average correlation degree among the
cluster genes, the genes most correlated with a selected
gene, and the correlation degree of the most correlated
genes of a selected gene with the rest of the genes.
Zoom-in operation
The researcher begins selecting his/her genes of interest
from the microarray genes, usually gene markers of concrete processes or pathologies that the researcher wants to
relate.

Clustering the samples from a part of a gene-expression
range.
Clustering the samples from a part of a gene-expression
relationship (the hidden-variable-dependent clustering, see
methods section).
Sample clustering based on previous knowledge: The clusters comes from a) medical or biological origin, provided
for example by the microarray developers, or b) obtained
by different statistical methods such as k-nearest neighbor
[18], Self-organizing Maps [19], Principal Components,
Biclustering [20], Locally Linear Embedding [21] and so
on.
The advantage of defining the clusters from an expression
relationship instead of an expression range is that we are
selecting the samples by the tendency maintained by the
relationship among two or more genes. As a result, our
clustering from an expression relationship class definition
more accurately defines the boundaries of the cell state
that we wish to associate with the sample class [11]. In
contrast to the previous knowledge way using a statistical
method that clusters the sample conditions by geneexpression similarity using all of the genes (or some of
them in Biclustering [22]), in the clustering from an expression relationship way, the sample clustering uses only the
gene markers of the processes in which the researcher is
interested (and based on the tendency of their expression
relationship). One of the main features that distinguishes
our cluster and class definition tools from the global staPage 4 of 8

BMC Bioinformatics 2009, 10:138

tistic methods used in the current software or the sample
classes defined by the microarray authors used in GEO [1]
is the flexibility of our progressive class definitions.
Second step: Searching non-continuous relationships
Once the sample classes are defined, the next step is to
define a class distribution and search these genes that follow this distribution of classes along their expressions. For
instance, we can query the genes in whose expressions one
class is over-expressed, with respect another. The supplied
genes should maintain a non-continuous relationships
among their expressions, where these relationships will be
defined by the class distribution required in the search
[11].
Last step: Observing the classes in the detailed view
Finally, in the detailed view, the distribution of the sample
classes along a gene-expression relationship can be
observed (Fig 2). In this way, the effect of each class on the
fluctuations of the dependence relationship can be analysed.
Biomedical Database Remote access
The purpose is to supply complementary information
beyond expression relationships.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/138

The GEO Microarrays-database [1] would be accessed
attempting to know if the marker genes found for the analysed microarray (for instance, the genes supplied by the
search of the last section) are gene markers in any GEO
datasets.
The searches of the zoom-in operation and non-continuous analysis select new gene markers in expression terms.
However, the researcher cannot know much more about
these genes at first. Accessing the remote databases, the
researcher can contextualise these relationships with new
biological and medical information; for instance, observing their location in KEGG maps [23], their proteins'
interaction [24-26], PubMed [27] papers that talk about
their connection, etc.
There are gene relationships that cannot be found in
expression terms. Nevertheless, these relationships can be
found accessing the remote biomedical databases (for
instance, interaction at the protein level, activation by
means of phosphorylation, proteolytic inactivation, etc.).
In this way the researcher can extend his/her analysis to
new genes related with the current genes of interest but
not exclusively in expression terms. The scope of this newgenes search can be limited to the clusters of selected

genes or it can be limited by the level of correlation with
these selected genes.
Assigning attributes to the sample classes
Our main objective is the holistic study of cell behaviour
taking advantage of the high-throughput potential of
microarray data. The classes definition and the attributes
assignment to sample classes are the key points to achieve
this. In this way, the cellular states and processes should
be characterised, trying to associate them with a concrete
class or subclass.

The attributes should give biological meaning to the sample classes, helping to identify and describe the cell state
in its widest definition, which each class represents. The
assignment of attributes comes from the four operations
previously described: From the non-continuous analysis
comes the definition of sample classes, from the zoom-in
operation and non-continuous analysis comes the identification of gene markers of each class, and from the access
to remote databases come the attributes assigned to each
class on the basis of the gene markers of each one. It works
as follows.

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/10/138

Obtaining gene markers from continuous analysis
The dependence relationship among gene expressions can
be observed in continuous analysis (Fig. 1 and 2). Each
fluctuation of this dependence can be selected as a new
sample class. Then, the compared genes become gene
markers of the new sample class, giving new attribute to it
s. Note that the compared genes can be gene markers of
apparently unconnected processes.
Obtaining gene markers form non-continuous analysis
The genes supplied by the search will be the gene markers
for the classes used as search parameters. These gene
markers will give new attributes to the classes.
Defining subclasses and obtaining more gene markers
When a subclass is defined from a sample class selecting
only a part of the class samples, the subclass has got the
attributes of the original class plus the new and differentiated attributes. It is commonly performed when a previously defined class is observed in a new relationship
analysis, and the researcher wishes to define a new class
from this relationship while conserving the original class
discrimination (Fig. 2). The genes compared in the new

The four operations include a phase for user interaction where the researcher reflects his/her interests
a phase where the system supplies the new gene markers to extend his/her analysis
and a view phase

relationship analysis will be gene markers of the new subclass but not of the original one.

acterise the cellular state or phenotype that these classes
represent.

Obtaining attributes based on gene markers by accessing remote
databases
The attributes can come from two kinds of databases:
Ones about gene-expressions and others besides geneexpressions.

With this analysis of the microarray sample conditions
divided into classes, we deal with the principal objective
of our web application: "Studying the cell behaviour and
phenotype changes from a holistic point of view". Note
that gene markers of very different processes can be related
in all of the operations for extending the analysis (taking
advantage of the high-throughput capability of microarray technology). The web application is currently used for
tumour study from a holistic point of view, covering fields
like cellular stress, cell proliferation, tissue remodelling,
mitochondrial activity, oxygen and ROS/NOS levels, cell
differentiation and dedifferentiation, membrane polarity,
intracellular and extracellular pH levels, circadian
rhythms, the inference of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system, metastasis, or interaction with
viruses and bacteria.

Accessing the GEO microarray datasets [1] for class genemarker, the researcher obtains the microarrays for which
this gene is also a gene marker. The attributes of these
microarray sample series will be the new attributes of the
class.
Accessing the biomedical databases [1,23-31] for class
gene-markers, the researcher will obtain the attributes that
will give the biological and medical significance to sample
classes. Notice that in this way the information will not be
supplied for each gene separately but rather for all of the
gene markers as a whole, defining the cell state of the sample class.

Conclusion
Let us see now how the four described operations are
adjusted to the four approaches followed to achieve the
progressive analysis towards the holistic perspective.
Through the zoom-in and zoom-out operations, the analysis
of the linear and non-linear relationships among geneexpressions are made. With the zoom-in operation, the
detailed analysis of the expression-dependence fluctuations is also provided.
Through the non-continuous analysis, the non-continuous relationships among gene-expressions that cannot be
detected by linear and non-linear methods can be finally
analysed.
The progressive extension of the analysis scope based on
researcher's interests are present in all four operations: In
the zoom-in operation, the genes linking the query ones
are supplied. In the non-continuous analysis, the genes
whose expression follows the required class distribution
are also supplied and the classes are successively redefined
in to subclasses. The access to remote databases enables
expanding the analysis beyond the expression relationships.
All of the operations are highly flexible and complementary using the results of one as an input of the next one,
thus making the progressive analysis possible. The purpose is to obtain the sample classes and attributes that
characterise these classes and, in a roundabout way, char-
