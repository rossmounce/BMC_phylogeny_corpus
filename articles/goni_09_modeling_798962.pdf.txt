Abstract
Background: A sudden emergence of Influenza A Virus (IAV) infections with a new pandemic
H1N1 IAV is taking place since April of 2009. In order to gain insight into the mode of evolution
of these new H1N1 strains, we performed a Bayesian coalescent Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) analysis of full-length neuraminidase (NA) gene sequences of 62 H1N1 IAV strains
(isolated from March 30th to by July 28th, 2009).
Results: The results of these studies revealed that the expansion population growth model was
the best to fit the sequence data. A mean of evolutionary change of 7.84 × 10-3 nucleotide
substitutions per site per year (s/s/y) was obtained for the NA gene. A significant contribution of
first codon position to this mean rate was observed. Maximum clade credibility trees revealed a
rapid diversification of NA genes in different genetic lineages, all of them containing Oseltamivirresistant viruses of very recent emergence. Mapping of naturally occurring amino acid substitutions
in the NA protein from 2009 H1N1 IAV circulating in 62 different patients revealed that
substitutions are distributed all around the surface of the molecule, leaving the hydrophobic core
and the catalytic site essentially untouched.
Conclusion: High evolutionary rates and fast population growth have contributed to the initial
transmission dynamics of 2009 H1N1 IAV. Naturally occurring substitutions are preferentially
located at the protein surface and do not interfere with the NA active site. Antigenic regions
relevant for vaccine development can differ from previous vaccine strains and vary among patients.

Background
Influenza A virus (IAV) is a member of the family
Orthomyxoviridae and contains eight segments of a singlestranded RNA genome with negative polarity [1]. IAV
causes 300,000-500,000 deaths worldwide each year, and
in pandemic years, this number can increase to 1 million
(in 1957-1958) or as high as 50 million, as was seen in

1918-1919 [2]. Unlike most pathogens where exposure
leads to lasting immunity in the host, IAV presents a moving antigenic target [3], evading specific immunity triggered by previous infections. This process, called antigenic
drift, is the result of the selective fixation of mutations in
the gene encoding the hemagglutinin (HA) protein, the
major target for the host immune response [4]. Variants

that best escape the host immune response are thought to
have a significant reproductive advantage [5].
Another process, called antigenic shift, is also considered
a major force in the evolution of IAV [4,5]. Antigenic shift
occurs when the virus acquires an HA of a different IAV
subtype via reassortment of one or more gene segments
and is thought to be the basis for the more devastating
influenza pandemics that occurred several times in the
last century [6]. New IAV pandemics may emerge through
reassortation with strains from swine or avian reservoirs
[7].
There have been three pandemics in the last hundred
years: in 1918 (H1N1 subtype) [8], 1957 (H2N2 subtype)
[9], and in 1968 (H3N2 subtype) [10]. During each of
these pandemics, the new virus drove the previous pandemic subtype out of circulation [3]. In 1977, the H1N1
subtype reappeared, and has been co-circulating with
H3N2 since then [11,12].
IAV H3N2 viruses have been the predominant strains during the last 20 years, with the exception of the 1988-1989
and 2000-2001 seasons where H1N1 infections dominated [13].
A sudden emergence of IAV infections with new H1N1
strains of pandemic potential is taking place since April of
2009, starting in Mexico and spreading to several other
countries around the world [14]. The World Health
Organization (WHO) has raised the Influenza pandemic
alert to the maximum level 6 [15].
Oseltamivir phosphate is a prodrug of oseltamivir carboxylate, a highly specific inhibitor of IAV neuraminidases.
Oseltamivir carboxylate binds to highly conserved, essential amino acids in the catalytic site of neuraminidase
(NA), preventing virus release from infected cells and subsequent virus spread [16]. An amino acid substitution at
position 275 (H275Y) of the NA protein has been associated to resistance to Oseltamivir [17].
Initial testing of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 IAV strains
found the viruses to be susceptible to neuraminidase
inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir).
Detailed studies on the mode of evolution of these new
H1N1 IAV strains are extremely important for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the
emergence, spread and resistance of new H1N1 IAV
strains of pandemic potential. In order gain insight into
these matters, we have performed a Bayesian coalescent
Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of full-length NA gene
sequences of 62 emerging 2009 H1N1 IAV strains (isolated from March 30th to July 28th, 2009). The results of

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/215

these studies revealed high rate of evolutionary change of
NA genes, fast expansion of the H1N1 IAV populations
and emergence of anti-viral resistant viruses. Naturally
occurring amino acid substitutions in the NA of H1N1
IAV strains circulating in 62 different patients preferentially located at the protein surface and do not interfere
with the NA active site.

Methods
Neuraminidase sequences
Full-length NA sequences from the 2009 emerging H1N1
IAV strains, were obtained from The Influenza Virus
Resource at the National Center for Biotechnological
Information [18]. For strain names, dates of isolation and
accession numbers see Table S1, Additional file 1.
Sequence alignment
NA sequences were aligned using the MUSCLE program
[19].
Evolutionary Model analysis
Once aligned, the FindModel program [20] was used to
identify the optimal evolutionary model that best fitted
our sequence dataset. Akaike Information Criteria
revealed that the General Time Reversible (GTR) model
was the best fit to the data (Table S2, Additional file 2).
Recombination Detection Tests
To test whether a recombination event occurred on any of
the sequences included in these studies, two different
approaches implemented in the SimPlot program [21]
were used: (1) a sliding window analysis of distances and
(2) the bootscanning [22]. No recombinant strains were
found in the datasets (not shown).
Bayesian Coalescent Inference Studies
The evolutionary rate and mode of evolution of the newly
emerging 2009 H1N1 IAV strains were determined using
a coalescent Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) approach as implemented in the BEAST package
[23]. Sixty-two full-length NA gene sequences were
included in these analyses. For names, accession numbers
and date of isolation of strains included in these studies,
see Table S1, Additional file 1,. Using the GTR model, 60
million steps of MCMC and dates introduced by day of
isolation, different population dynamic models were
tested (constant population size, exponential population
growth, expansion population growth, logistic population growth and Bayesian Skyline). Statistical uncertainty
in the data was reflected by the 95% highest probability
density (HPD) values. Results were examined using the
TRACER program from the BEAST package [24]. Convergence was assessed with ESS (Effective Sample Size) values, after a burning of 6 million steps. Maximum clade
credibility trees were generated using Tree Annotator from

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/215

the BEAST package and the FigTree v1.2.2 (available at:
http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/) was used for the visualization of
the annotated trees.

Results
Modelling gene sequences changes over time in NA gene of
2009 H1N1 emerging strains
In order to gain insight into the evolutionary rate and
mode of evolution of 2009 H1N1 IAV strains, we used a
Bayesian Markov Chain Montecarlo (MCMC) approach
to analyze 62 full-length NA gene sequences from 2009
H1N1 IAV strains isolated from March 30th to July 28th,
2009 (for strains names, accession numbers and dates of
isolation, see Table S1, Additional file 1,).

Using the GTR model and 60 million steps of MCMC, different population dynamics models were tested (constant
population size, exponential population growth, expansion population growth, logistic population growth and
Bayesian skyline). Statistical uncertainty in the data was
reflected by the 95% highest probability density (HDP)
values. Convergence was assessed with Effective Sample
Size (ESS) values, after a burning of 6 million steps. Comparison of the values obtained for marginal likelihoods as
well as ESS of these models revealed that the Expansion
Population Growth model was the best to fit the data.
The results shown in Table 1 are the outcome of the analysis for 60 million steps of the MCMC, using the GTR
model, a relaxed clock [24] and the Expansion Population
Growth model [25].
As can be seen in Table 1, our results suggest that the NA
gene of the 2009 H1N1 emerging IAV strains evolved
from ancestors that existed around August 17th, 2008. This
is in agreement with previous results situating the most
recent common ancestor (MRCA) for the NA gene of 2009
H1N1 IAV around August 8th, 2008 [26].
When the GTR model is used, a mean of 7.84 × 10-3 nucleotide substitutions per site per year (s/s/y) was obtained

for the NA gene (Table 1). This rate is roughly comparable
to previous estimations of IAV NA evolutionary rates (3.6
× 10-3 s/s/y) [26]. Interestingly, a significant contribution
of the first codon position to the evolutionary rate was
also found (Table 1). Moreover, an important expansion
growth rate was observed (see Table 1).
Phylogenetic tree analysis of NA genes from 2009 H1N1
IAV strains
To study the phylogenetic relations among the NA genes
from the 62 H1N1 IAV strains enrolled in these studies,
maximum clade credibility trees were generated using
software from the BEAST package [23]. The results of these
studies are shown in Figure 1.

As it can be seen in the figure, different genetic subbranches can be observed. Interestingly, Oseltamivirresistant viruses can be observed in all main genetic subbranches. These viruses are situated on the tip of the trees
suggesting a recent emergence from the 2009 H1N1 IAV
populations (see Figure 1). This is in agreement with the
initial studies revealing that 2009 H1N1 IAV strains were
susceptible to Oseltamivir and the recent selection of
resistant viruses from these viral populations [17].
Mapping of positive-selected and co-evolving sites in a 3D
NA protein model
An homology-based 3D structure model of the NA protein of 2009 H1N1 IAV strains have been very recently
obtained [27] (available at http://mendel.bii.astar.edu.sg/SEQUENCES/H1N1/). In order to observe if
the amino acids substitutions naturally occurring in the
NA genes of the 62 H1N1 IAV studied were associated to
previously identified antigenic regions or the active site of
the NA protein (being the latter the binding cavity of Oseltamivir and other NA inhibitors drugs), we mapped all
substitutions found in NA proteins of all IAV enrolled in
these studies in a temporal order, according to the date of
isolation of each strain. The results of these studies are
shown in Figure 2.

Bayesian MCMC phylogenetic tree analysis of 62 NA genes from 2009 H1N1 IAV strains. A maximum credibility
clade obtained using the GTR model, the expansion population growth model and a relaxed clock (uncorrelated exponential) is
shown. Strains in the tree are shown by name. Main genetic sub-branches are indicated by capital letters (A through D). Node
ages are shown in days at the nodes of the tree. The tree is rooted to theirMRCA. Bar at the bottom of the tree show time in
days. Strains carrying the H275Y, that confers resistance to Oseltamivir, are shown in red.

As it can be seen in the figure, no substitution was found
to be related to the active site of the NA protein (see Figure
2). Importantly, none of the substitutions found in our
dataset appears sufficiently close to affect the drug binding pocket (see Figure 2).

Discussion
The antigenic variability of IAV is the basis for the recurring epidemics each year [28]. IAV presents a moving antigenic target, evading immunity triggered by previous
infections. For these reasons, efforts to characterize epidemic variants [29] are deemed important for improving

influenza vaccine formulation, since the closer the vaccine
strain is to the dominant variant, the more effective the
vaccine [30].
A sudden emergence of new H1N1 IAV of swine origin is
taking place since April of 2009 [15]. This pandemic
started in Mexico and it is currently spreading to all
regions of the world [14]. On June 11th, the WHO officially raised the phase of pandemic alert to level 6. As of
July 19th, 137,232 cases of the 2009 H1N1 IAV emerging
strains have been officially confirmed in 142 countries
[31].

Figure
Mapping2of naturally occurring amino acid substitutions in a NA protein 3D structure
Mapping of naturally occurring amino acid substitutions in a NA protein 3D structure. The 3D structure model of
the NA protein from 2009 H1N1 IAV shown in the figure was obtained by Mauer-Stroh et al. [27] (Bioinformatic Institute,
A*STAR's Biomedical Sciences Institutes, Singapore). Oseltamivir atoms are shown in red. Antibodies binding sites are shown
in green. Position 275, where substitution H275Y confers resistance to Oseltamivir, is shown in pink. The substitutions found
among strains isolated during 30, 60, 90 (where viruses with H275Y substitution also arise) and 119 days (from March 30th,
2009) are shown in yellow, blue, orange and white in A through D, respectively. Dotted white lines show distances in Å.
Different approaches have been extremely useful in
increasing our understanding of the spatial-temporal
transmission dynamics of influenza. They have also provided assistance in evaluating the potential severity of IAV
pandemics, where severity was defined by the value of the
Basic Reproduction Number (R0) [32].
The R0 for novel influenza A (H1N1) has recently been
estimated to be between 1.4 and 1.6 [33], revealing an
important expansion of this IAV population. Fortunately,
this value is below values of R0 estimated for the 19181919 pandemic strain (mean R0~2, range 1.4 to 2.8) [32].

These results are in agreement with the results found in
this work using a Bayesian coalescent MCMC approach
(see Table 1). A high expansion growth rate (66.43 new
infections/individual/year) was achieved, particularly
considering the short period of time studied (March 30th
to July 28th, 2009). These results suggest that the pandemic caused by the 2009 H1N1 IAV will continue its
expansion phase at a significant rate.
We estimated that the NA of the 2009 H1N1 IAV evolved
from ancestors that existed around August 17th, 2008
(Table 1). Interestingly, this date is in agreement with first

Virology Journal 2009, 6:215

estimations of the MRCA for that gene of these pandemic
strains (August 8th, 2008) [26]. This result suggests that
the NA gene segment of these viruses were presumably circulating in the swine reservoir before emerging into the
human population, in agreement with recent results [34].
The first estimation of evolutionary rate for the NA gene
of the 2009 H1N1 IAV strains established a rate of 3.65 ×
10-3 [26]. In this study, a mean evolutionary rate of 7.84 ×
10-3 s/s/y was obtained (see Table 1). Although not
entirely dissimilar rates are found, the possible differences
among the two estimations may be due to the fact that the
first estimations were carried out at the beginning of the
pandemic outbreak, where only 30 NA sequences isolated
over a shorter time span (from March to May) were available [26]. In this work, 62 full-length NA sequences, isolated from March to the end of July, were employed (see
Table S1, Additional file 1). Importantly, a contribution
of first codon position of 0.97 (from a total of 3.0) to the
mean evolutionary rate was found (Table 1). This speaks
of a comparatively higher contribution of non-synonymous substitutions to the mean substitution rate. This
result is in agreement with previous reports showing a
comparatively higher non-synonymous to synonymous
(dn/ds) substitution rate ratio in the 2009 H1N1 IAV
strains [26]. Moreover, a contribution of first codon position to main evolutionary rate like the one found in this
study is significantly higher than the ones previously
found in other RNA viruses, like Hepatitis A virus (0.33,
VP1 gene) [35] and Noroviruses (0.55, VP1 gene) [36].
Maximum clade credibility trees revealed a rapid diversification of NA genes in at least four main phylogenetic lineages (Figure 1). Nevertheless, due to the fact that the
degree of genetic variation among all strains included in
these analysis is roughly low (with a maximum degree of
variation of 0.64%), more studies will be needed to confirm these findings. Interestingly, Oseltamivir resistance
was found only in the more recent samples and two of
them, the A/Washington/28/2009 and the A/Washington/29/2009, appear to be phylogenetically and geographically linked (Figure 1). This finding also suggests
that anti-viral resistant viruses can emerge in any genetic
lineage, as a result of selection of mutant viruses from the
viral population. Oseltamivir-resistant viruses are situated
on the tips of the tree. This reveals a recent emergence
from previously susceptible viruses (Figure 1). This result
is in agreement with initial studies showing the susceptibility of the H1N1 IAV emerging strains to this drug and
its widespread use to combat the spread of these viruses
all around the world [17].
Mapping of substitutions found in the 62 NA proteins
during the four month period covered by this study
revealed that substitutions are distributed all around the

http://www.virologyj.com/content/6/1/215

surface of the molecule, leaving the hydrophobic core and
the catalytic site essentially untouched (see Fig. 2). Nevertheless, strains carrying the H275Y substitution were also
observed in these studies (see Figs 1 and 2). Very recent
studies on the structure of the NA of mutant IAV strains
carrying this substitution, revealed that the bulkier Tyr residue alters the orientation of the key Glu 277 residue [37].
On binding Oseltamivir, the conformation of the Glu 277
side chain of the wild type enzyme is altered such that it
exposes a hydrophobic site with which the pentyloxy
group of Oseltamivir interacts [37]. In the mutant
enzyme, the bulkier Tyr residue at position 275 displaces
the carboxyl group of Glu 277 into the binding site, such
that it disrupts the hydrophobic pocket and causes a
change in conformation of the pentyloxy substituent of
Oseltamivir, with consequent reduction in affinity of
binding of some 300-fold or greater [38].
Interestingly, this is not the case of Zanamivir, since the
H275Y substitution causes only a small shift in the position of Glu 277, without disrupting the H-bonds between
Glu 277 and the glycerol moiety of the drug [38]. This suggests that other NA inhibitors, like Zanamivir or Peramivir
should still be effective against this H1N1 IAV strains.
Importantly, substitutions observed in the 62 patients
enrolled in this study suggest that changes at possible antigenic sites at NA protein surface may indeed occur (see
Figure 2). For that reason, vaccines to previous strains or
acquired immunity from previous IAV infections are
expected to be less effective. More detailed studies on the
2009 H1N1 IAV evolution are extremely needed in order
to select appropriate IAV vaccine strains.

Conclusion
A coalescent Bayesian Markov Chain Montecarlo
(MCMC) approach was used to analyze 62 full-length NA
gene sequences from 2009 H1N1 IAV strains, isolated
from March 30th to July 28th, 2009. When the Expansion
Population Growth model was employed a high rate of
evolutionary change of 7.84 × 10-3 s/s/y was obtained for
the NA gene. Importantly, a significant contribution of
the first codon position to the mean evolutionary rate was
also found. Moreover, an important expansion growth
rate of 66.43 new infections/individual/year was also
observed. Taking these results together, high evolutionary
rates and fast population growth have contributed to the
initial transmission dynamics of 2009 H1N1 IAV. Naturally occurring substitutions are preferentially located at
the protein surface and do not interfere with the NA active
site. Antigenic regions relevant for vaccine development
can differ from previous vaccine strains and vary among
patients.
