Abstract
Background: Eukaryotic replication origins exhibit different initiation efficiencies and activation
times within S-phase. Although local chromatin structure and function influences origin activity, the
exact mechanisms remain poorly understood. A key to understanding the exact features of
chromatin that impinge on replication origin function is to define the precise locations of the DNA
sequences that control origin function. In S. cerevisiae, Autonomously Replicating Sequences (ARSs)
contain a consensus sequence (ACS) that binds the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) and is
essential for origin function. However, an ACS is not sufficient for origin function and the majority
of ACS matches do not function as ORC binding sites, complicating the specific identification of
these sites.
Results: To identify essential origin sequences genome-wide, we utilized a tiled oligonucleotide
array (NimbleGen) to map the ORC and Mcm2p binding sites at high resolution. These binding sites
define a set of potential Autonomously Replicating Sequences (ARSs), which we term nimARSs.
The nimARS set comprises 529 ORC and/or Mcm2p binding sites, which includes 95% of known
ARSs, and experimental verification demonstrates that 94% are functional. The resolution of the
analysis facilitated identification of potential ACSs (nimACSs) within 370 nimARSs. Cross-validation
shows that the nimACS predictions include 58% of known ACSs, and experimental verification
indicates that 82% are essential for ARS activity.
Conclusion: These findings provide the most comprehensive, accurate, and detailed mapping of
ORC binding sites to date, adding to the emerging picture of the chromatin organization of the
budding yeast genome.

Background
Eukaryotic chromosomal DNA replication initiates from
numerous loci, termed replication origins, distributed
along each chromosome. The selection of chromosomal
sites that will function as origins begins with the binding

to DNA of the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC) [1,2].
During late M and early G1 phases, ORC, together with
Cdc6 and Cdt1, directs the loading onto origin DNA of
MCM complexes to assemble pre-replicative complexes
(pre-RCs). Upon S-phase entry, activation of pre-RCs

leads to DNA unwinding and the assembly of replisomes
that carry out DNA synthesis [3,4]. Origins differ in their
timing of activation during S-phase and their frequency of
activation (maximum once per cell cycle). A clear understanding of factors that influence the efficiency and timing
of initiation is lacking, although histone modification,
nucleosome positioning, and transcription have been
implicated [5-11]. Chromatin structure also appears to
influence the selection of ORC binding sites [1,12,13].
In most eukaryotic cells, specific sequences do not appear
to be required for ORC binding [13-15]. For example, in
fission yeast, almost any highly A/T-rich sequence of sufficient length (~1 kb) can function as a replication origin.
In Xenopus egg extracts and Drosophila embryos, apparently random, closely spaced DNA sequences serve as replication origins to facilitate rapid cell (nuclear) division
cycles. During embryogenesis, the number of sites used as
origins decreases with the onset of transcription. This correlation suggests that the establishment of chromatin
domains related to transcription limits the number of
ORC binding sites in the chromatin. In mammalian cells,
transfection of almost any DNA fragment of sufficient
length can support replication, suggesting that ORC binding is generally stochastic but requires the presence of an
accessible region in the chromatin. Furthermore, the activity of certain sequences as replication origins in mammalian cells correlates with local differences in gene
expression in different cell types or lineages [16-19].
Saccharomyces cerevisiae differs somewhat in that specific
DNA loci that function as replication origins (termed
Autonomously Replicating Sequences or ARSs) contain a
consensus sequence (ARS Consensus Sequence or ACS)
that is essential for ORC binding and origin function
[1,20,21]. However, an ACS alone is not sufficient for origin function and this sequence is much more abundant
than the number of ORC binding sites or functional replication origins [20,22]. In addition to an ACS, ARSs contain at least one A/T-rich region of DNA thought to act as
a DNA unwinding element. Although an unwinding element is important for origin function, it is not required for
ORC binding [23]. Thus, despite its sequence preference,
it remains unclear exactly how ORC binding sites are
selected from the many potential sequences; however,
local chromatin structures and activities are probably
important factors. Indeed, the great majority of origins
locate to intergenic regions [24]. While this and other
studies suggest active transcription and origin function are
antagonistic [25,26], the effect of transcription factors on
local chromatin can also be important. Detailed analysis
of ARS1 suggests that factors that position nucleosomes
surrounding origins (including ORC itself) influence origin initiation efficiency [5,27-29]. Additional information
on the chromatin organization in relation to ORC at a

variety of origins exhibiting different characteristics (e.g.
timing, efficiency, chromosomal location) should yield
valuable insights into the mechanisms that regulate origin
function. A precise mapping of ORC binding sites
throughout the genome is an important step in this direction.
The advent of DNA microarrays has enabled the genomewide analysis of DNA replication dynamics and identification of replication origins in a number of eukaryotic
organisms [30,31]. In S. cerevisiae, various approaches
have been fruitful. Some studies have directly analyzed
replication timing by monitoring the time at which specific DNA sequences double in copy number or incorporate a chemically distinct precursor (e.g. densitysubstitution) [32,33]. A very recent study mapped the
presence of single-stranded DNA during replication,
which is expected to identify sites undergoing DNA synthesis [34]. These types of studies have provided valuable
data on the overall dynamics of genome duplication.
These studies also identified the positions of ~300 active
replication origins, typically to within several kilobases
(4–10 kb).
An alternative approach to identifying replication origins
used genome-wide location analysis to determine the
positions of ORC and MCM proteins [24]. This study
identified 429 sites predicted to have ARS function with a
resolution of ~1 kb. This level of resolution facilitated
experimental validation of the data set, demonstrating
79% positive predictive value (PPV, defined as the percentage of true sites among all called sites). Because this
particular study analyzed the position of static protein
complexes, it provided a more precise mapping than the
timing-based studies, but did not by itself characterize the
activity of the predicted sites. Thus, the replication
dynamics and protein location analyses provide complementary information to help create an accurate description of genome duplication. These studies did not attempt
to identify the exact DNA sequences (ACSs) bound by
ORC, which are essential for origin function. However,
one study has identified potential ACS using a purely
sequence-based search algorithm (Oriscan) [22]. Among
the top 350 Oriscan sites (which is similar to the total
number of origins predicted or inferred by other studies),
56% matched known ARS or proARS sequences.
To provide a more accurate and complete map of essential
origin sequences that bind ORC, we performed genomewide location analysis of ORC and Mcm2p with a highdensity, tiled oligonucleotide microarray. The 529 ORC
and/or Mcm2p binding sites revealed potential ARSs with
high accuracy. The resolution of this analysis allowed for
precise localization of hundreds of functional ACSs,

which serve as ORC binding sites, throughout the
genome.

Results
Genome-wide identification of ORC and Mcm2p binding
sites
Previously, we used genome-wide location analysis to
map chromosomal binding sites of ORC and MCM proteins to about 1 kb resolution using DNA microarrays
[21,24]. These microarrays contained about 12,000 cDNA
probes, typically one for each open reading frame (ORF)
and one for each intergenic region of the S. cerevisiae
genome, with an average probe size of 618 bp. To map
ORC and MCM binding sites with greater precision and
facilitate the identification of ACSs within the identified
binding regions, we performed genome-wide location
analysis of ORC and Mcm2p using tiled oligonucleotide
microarrays (NimbleGen) containing one 50mer oligonucleotide to represent each 80 bp segment of the genome,
in triplicate. DNA enriched for ORC and Mcm2p binding

sites was isolated by chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) of ORC from M-phase cells and Mcm2p from G1phase cells, respectively. Immunoprecipitated and total
genomic DNA from each sample was differentially labeled
and co-hybridized to the arrays.
Data were analyzed as outlined in Figure 1A (and see
Methods). Briefly, a two-state Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) with a mixture of Gaussian outputs was used to
model the data (Figure 1B and see Additional file 1). This
analysis identified 400 ORC-enriched regions and 634
MCM2-enriched regions. The ORC and MCM2 enriched
regions intersect at 353 sites. Because the ORC and MCM2
intersecting regions generally do not overlap exactly, the
union is used in defining a single site, resulting in 349 discrete (non-overlapping) regions that we refer to as ORCMCM2 sites. The HMM-called regions, a total of 677 discrete sites, are divided into three groups: 47 ORC-only
sites, 281 MCM2-only sites and 349 ORC-MCM2 sites
(see Additional files 2, 3, and 4, respectively).

On these tiled oligonucleotide arrays, the immunoprecipitated target DNA (average shear size of ~1 kb) is expected
to identify numerous probes for each binding site, with
the probes' standardized log2 signal intensities (Z) forming a peak centered very close to the actual protein binding site. To locate the peak probe more accurately, the Zvalues were smoothed using a moving average (see Methods). Within each HMM-called region, peaks of ORC and/
or MCM2 signal were identified based on a continuous
increase of the smoothed Z values (sZ) for at least five
probes followed by a continuous decrease of sZ for at least
five probes. A corresponding peak strength was calculated
as the average Z value (avgZ) (see Additional files 2, 3 and
4).
ARS prediction
We sought criteria to evaluate the merit of the three classes
of binding sites for ARS prediction. The ORC-MCM2 class
is anticipated to have the strongest predictive value
because two different pre-RC proteins co-localize at these
sites. Thus, we compared characteristics of the ORC-only
and MCM2-only sites to the ORC-MCM2 sites. Among
experimentally verified ARS sites, 95% are contained in
the HMM-called data set (see Additional file 5); of these,
77% are defined by ORC-MCM2 sites, 23% by MCM2only sites, and none by ORC-only sites. These results suggest that Mcm2p binding is a more sensitive predictor of
ARS location than ORC binding.

Examination of peak strength shows that true ARSs are
associated with robust signals. For the 89 known ARSs
identified in this analysis, 95% of the MCM2 peaks and
92% of the ORC peaks had avgZ ≥ 2.75. Comparison of
signal strength between the three classes of sites shows
that, on average, peaks of ORC-only sites are significantly
weaker than peaks of MCM2-only sites as well as peaks of
ORC or MCM2 in ORC-MCM2 sites (rank sum test pvalue < 0.001 for all cases). Furthermore, peaks of MCM2only sites are on average significantly weaker than peaks
of ORC or MCM2 in ORC-MCM2 sites (rank sum test pvalue < 0.001) (Figure 2). Combined with the proportions
of known ARSs associated with each of these classes, these
findings suggest that ORC-only sites have the lowest,
ORC-MCM2 sites the strongest, and MCM2-only sites an
intermediate predictive value.
A bona fide ARS is anticipated to contain an ACS that serves
as the ORC binding site. An objective search for a common motif in each group of binding sites using de novo
motif finding recovered the ACS motif from the ORCMCM2 sites (Figure 3). In fact, the recovered motif is very
similar to the extended ACS (EACS) described by Theis
and Newlon [21], and also 89% similar to the motif generated by alignment of 31 previously identified, functional ACSs (see Additional file 12). For the MCM2-only

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/276

group, a motif that is 70% similar to the EACS is recovered. No significant motif is recovered from the ORC-only
sites (Figure 3). (See Methods for a description of the calculation of inter-motif similarity.) These results further
support the idea that ORC-MCM2 sites are accurate predictors of origins whereas ORC-only sites appear to be
poor predictors. The MCM2-only group probably contains a greater proportion of non-ARS sequences than the
ORC-MCM2 group, complicating identification of the
ACS motif in this group.
As ORC-MCM2 sites have a stronger average MCM2 peak
signal than the average peak signal of the MCM2-only
class, a threshold peak signal (avgZ ≥ 2.75) was established to select MCM2-only and ORC-only regions with a
high probability of ARS activity. These were included in
the set of potential ARSs called "nimARS". In total, 529
nimARS sites are defined, including 349 ORC-MCM2
sites, 178 MCM2-only sites, and two ORC-only sites (see
Additional file 6). This data set includes 95% of experimentally confirmed ARSs (thus the sensitivity is 95%; sensitivity is defined as the percentage of sites that are called
among all true sites in the genome). The chromosomal
distribution of these sites is shown in Figure 4.
Validation of ARS predictions and comparison with
previous studies
Our analysis predicted 52 nimARS loci on chromosomes
I and II. We tested the ARS function of 46 of these loci
(five had been previously confirmed and one resisted
analysis), and found that all but two have ARS activity
(Table 1 and see Additional file 10). We also tested eight
sites on chromosome X that were not predicted in the previous pro-ARS data set [24]. ARS activity was confirmed
for six of these sites (3 strong, 2 weak and 1 very weak
activity), one lacked activity, and one resisted analysis. On
chromosomes III and VI, for which ARS activity has been
comprehensively tested [35-37], the nimARS set predicts
five new sites. Experimental analysis of these sites showed
weak ARS activity for three sites, and two lacked activity
(Table 1 and see Additional file 10). Comparing the
cumulative experimental results from chromosomes I, II,
III, VI, and X shows 94% PPV of the nimARS predictions
(Table 1 and see Additional file 10) [24,35-37].

Comparison of our data with previous array-based origin
predictions demonstrates considerable overlap. A Venn
diagram shows the intersection of four data sets, proARS
[24], timeARS [32], ssARS [34] and the current nimARS
(Figures 5A and 5B). The criterion used to define corresponding sites is overlap between the defined regions. For
the 332 timeARSs the region is defined as the 5 kb flanking each side of the peak. Of these timeARS regions, 231
(70%) intersect with 261 (49%) nimARS regions. For the
364 ssARS, the region is defined as the 4 kb flanking each

side of the average position of ssDNA peaks at three time
points. For this case, 301 (57%) nimARS regions intersect
with 303 (83%) ssARS. The high overlap of nimARS with
both timeARS and ssARS strongly suggests that nimARS
includes the majority of active ARSs. Among the proARS
sites, 342 (80%) overlap with 331 (63%) nimARS sites,
numbers that closely correspond to the expected number
of positives in the proARS data set (0.79 × 429 = 338). We
tested 22 proARSs that do not overlap with a nimARS site
and found that all 22 lack ARS activity (see Additional file
11). This finding underscores the greater accuracy of
nimARS data. Also notable is the detection of ARS304
(MCM2-32), ARS319 (ORCMCM2-41) and ARS604
(ORCMCM2-105), three known ARSs that are inactive as
chromosomal origins and have not been previously
detected using array methodologies [24,32-35,37]. In fact,
testing of 26 additional sites not identified by any previous array studies shows that 80% (21 of 26) have ARS
activity, although this activity is frequently weak (see
Additional file 10). The identification of numerous new
ARSs indicates that the current analysis has higher sensitivity than previous studies, and includes some sites that
have marginal activity.
ORC and Mcm2p binding within nimARS regions
Use of tiled oligonucleotide arrays yielded high-resolution data for which certain characteristics of ORC and

Mcm2p binding in vivo as analyzed by ChIP could be
examined. The mean lengths of individually defined ORC
and MCM2 regions within the set of ORC-MCM2 sites are
not significantly different (signed rank test of equality has
p-value = 0.89), suggesting that the ORC and MCM complexes associate with similar lengths of chromatin (Figure
6A). To assess the relative positions of ORC and Mcm2p,
we compared the distance between the ORC and MCM2
peaks within the ORC-MCM2 sites (Figure 6B). The peak
of the ORC or MCM2 signal within each binding site is
anticipated to identify the oligonucleotide probe closest
to the protein-binding site. Although there was a significant range to the data, the most common occurrence was
co-localization of the ORC and MCM2 peaks to the same
probe, which represents an 80 bp region. These data are
consistent with ORC and MCM proteins occupying similar locations within ARS chromatin.
ACS identification
Peak identification within the HMM-called regions provides a high-resolution map of ORC (and Mcm2p) binding that is expected to correspond to the location of an
ACS. For the 31 ACSs that have been experimentally verified, ORC peaks are found on average 236 bp (95% confidence interval is 0 – 474 bp) from the defined ACS while
MCM2 peaks average 222 bp (95% confidence interval is
0 – 525 bp) (Figure 7). A signed rank test shows no signif-

icant difference between the locations of the two distributions (p-value = 0.38). These distances are significantly
shorter than the average shear size of the target DNA, suggesting that the shear size does not strictly limit the resolution on the tiling array due to presence of signal peaks
in the data. The lack of a closer co-localization is at least
partly due to the fact that probes corresponding to the
exact ACS are frequently missing from the array due to the
AT richness of these sequences (for examples, see Fig 7B).
The resolution of the nimARS data provides an opportunity to precisely define essential ACSs by narrowing a
search to a relatively small region surrounding each
nimARS data peak. A Positional Weight Matrix (PWM)
generated from the 31 known ACSs yields a motif contain-

ing an EACS as well as three additional positions corresponding to the B1 element (of ARS1) (see Additional
files 7 and 12). Interestingly, two of these three nucleotide
positions had been previously mapped as sites of contact
with ORC at ARS1 [38], suggesting this interaction is conTable 1: Summary of ARS testing results and known ARSs for

served. This EACS+B1 PWM was used to search a 1 kb window centered on each ORC and MCM2 peak. A 1 kb
window was chosen because this roughly corresponds to
the 95% confidence interval window for the distance of
ORC and MCM peaks from known ACSs (see above). The
EACS+B1 identified within the nimARS set are called
nimACS (see Additional file 8). Using a p-value cutoff of
1.3 × 10-4, we identified 506 nimACS in 370 nimARS
(78% have single ACS, 22% have multiple ACSs, see Additional file 8). (In comparison, this method and p-value
identifies 3271 EACS+B1 sites within the entire genome.)
The percentage of nimARS with multiple nimACSs is close
to the proportion of known ARSs with multiple functional
ACSs (5/25). A three-fold cross-validation (see Methods)
shows that the nimACS includes 58% of known ACSs
(thus the sensitivity is 58%). The accuracy of the defined
nimACSs was tested by mutating 17 ACSs predicted
within 14 ARSs on chromosome X (see Additional file 9).
For 11 of these ARSs, mutation of the single predicted ACS
eliminated ARS function. For the remaining three ARSs in
which two ACSs were predicted in each, one of the two
sites was essential for ARS function while the other was
dispensable. These results indicate a PPV of 82%.

Discussion
ARS identification in S. cerevisiae by genome-wide motif
scanning has been hampered by the abundance of
sequences with high similarity to the ACS, combined with
the level of degeneracy of the ACS that supports function.

Potential solutions to this problem include: (1) building
larger motif models by including other concurrent motifs
[39] or compositional information [22,40]; (2) assuming
a specific motif distribution on chromosomes, e.g., a Hidden Markov Model [41,42]; and (3) narrowing down the
regions to be searched. The first two methods rely on
assumptions, which may introduce significant error. This
study took the third approach, using a high-resolution
array to map ORC and Mcm2p binding regions and confining the motif-search to this fraction (~5%) of the
genome. A very recently published study took a fourth
approach, analyzing phylogenetic conservation, in conjunction with motif searching and published microarray
data to predict ACS locations [43].
We defined 529 nimARS loci throughout the S. cerevisiae
genome that avidly bind ORC and/or Mcm2p. The vast
majority of known ARSs (95%) are contained in the
nimARS set and virtually all predicted sites exhibit ARS
activity when tested (94%). Comparison to a recently
determined set of chromosomally active replication origins (ssARS) shows that 83% are contained in the nimARS
set [34]. Together, these analyses confirm the high accuracy of the nimARS data. The HMM analysis is capable of
identifying even weak signals, while the target DNA identifies multiple probes on the tiled oligonucleotide array
for each binding site, a redundancy that enhances accuracy. We further defined this data set by determining the
signal peaks within the nimARS regions and constrained

ARS309 and ARS604 the ORC peaks are located close to the ACS, but the MCM2 peaks are quite far due to shifted signal;
ARS601/ARS602 and ARS310 have multiple proximate ACSs but do not confer multiple peaks in the data. Many ARSs show
missing probes in the ACS region (15 out of 31 known ACSs have missing probes corresponding to the ACS).

the motif search to a 1 kb segment centered on each peak.
Within 370 (70%) of the nimARS loci we identified at
least one nimACS, with an overall PPV of 82%.
Approximately one-third of the predicted nimARSs are
loci where only Mcm2p was detected. Of the nimARSs for
which ARS activity has been demonstrated (in this or previous studies), 34% (52/152; see Additional files 5 and
10) are MCM2-only sites. This observation suggests that
the majority of these sites will prove to possess ARS activity. Furthermore, ORC binding was not detected at 23% of
known ARSs, while nimACSs, which predict ORC binding, are found at 103 of 178 of the MCM2-only sites.
Finally, we have no evidence (such as a unique motif) suggesting that MCM2-only sites represent a distinct function
of Mcm2p, which might be independent of ORC.
As ORC is bound to chromatin throughout the cell cycle
in budding yeast and is required to "load" the MCM complex onto DNA, the detection of many MCM2-only sites
suggests that ORC is present but recalcitrant to detection
by ChIP, perhaps due to local chromatin differences.
Indeed, we analyzed ORC binding in G2/M-arrested cells
because pre-RC assembly is thought to occlude detection
of ORC in G1-arrested cells [44]. However, we have
recently found that ORC binding at some ARSs is more
strongly detectable by ChIP during G1- or S-phase (JGA
and OMA, unpublished). One possibility is that Cdc6 stabilizes binding of ORC to weaker sites during G1 to permit MCM loading [45,46]. This would explain the loading
of Mcm2p in G1-phase at sites where ORC failed detection in G2/M, and is consistent with the idea that ORC
occupancy and stability varies at different sites depending
on local chromatin features or DNA sequence variation.
Whereas ORC detection by ChIP may be context- or cell
cycle-dependent, Mcm2p seems to be more reliably
detected. This may reflect differences in the way the ORC
and MCM complexes interact with DNA. In contrast to
models of ORC-DNA binding along the A rich strand of
DNA [38], the MCM complex is thought to encircle one or
both strands of DNA [47,48]. Such a topology might
enhance cross-linking of MCM to chromatin or otherwise
stabilize these complexes for immunoprecipitation. A
greater stability of the MCM complex in pre-RCs is supported by in vitro data in which high salt extraction of preRCs removes ORC (and Cdc6) from DNA, but not the
MCM complex [49-52].
Significantly more pre-RCs are formed than are normally
utilized to replicate the genome. This work predicts about
500 pre-RCs are formed while other studies indicate that
about 260–360 of these are primarily responsible for replicating the genome [32-34]. Some inefficient pre-RCs
retain potential for activation but fail to initiate replica-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/276

tion because replication forks emanating from efficient,
nearby origins replicate through these sites, thereby eliminating their activation potential (presumably by dismantling the pre-RC) [53,54]. However, some sites at which
ORC and/or Mcm2p can be identified exhibit relatively
weak initiation potential. In some cases weak initiation is
due to local chromatin, such as at the mating-type silencer
ARSs, because these ARSs function efficiently when
removed from their normal chromatin context [55]. However, some ARSs function poorly in the plasmid context,
suggesting that sequence variation results in reduced ORC
binding or inefficient DNA unwinding [56]. Sequence
variation explains the failure to identify a robust ACS
(EACS+B1) within about 30% of the nimARS. Further
study will be required to determine how the sequence
composition of the ACS and the surrounding sequences,
as well as the presence of nearby motifs bound by other
DNA binding proteins, contribute to the differential efficiency of ARSs (although specific cases, such as the
silencer-associated with ARSs, have been identified
[9,57,58]).
The molecular evolution of sequence and activity among
different ORC binding sites (and related sequences)
occurs under different selective pressures than that of individual genes or unique sequences with defined functions,
as indicated by lower levels of phylogenetic conservation
of yeast origins compared to genes [43]. This is because
most individual ORC binding sites likely contribute little
or nothing to the organism's fitness. The main requirement is that a sufficient number of efficient origins be distributed along each chromosome to ensure rapid genome
duplication. Hence, sequence changes that increase the
origin efficiency of one ORC binding site may reduce
selective pressure on ORC binding sites on the same chromosome (especially nearby), resulting in weaker binding
sites or even sites with specialized function such as the
silencers. Origin sequence evolution also may derive from
selective pressures on local gene functions if these are
influenced by the presence of ORC. Nevertheless, the presence of excess ORC binding sites can help ensure efficient
genome duplication in case the normal origin initiation
program is disrupted [59], and hence, the ability of ORC
to bind sequence variants is functionally significant. The
ability of ORC to bind varied DNA sequences appears to
be particularly important in higher organisms where ORC
binding appears to conform to differential chromatin
contexts related to developmentally regulated gene
expression.

Conclusion
A central goal of current research in genomics is a precise
and comprehensive mapping of all the protein-protein
and protein-DNA associations that comprise the chromatin. Sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins such as ORC

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/7/276

are thought to play an important role in establishing the
local chromatin architecture by influencing the positioning (and possibly modifications) of histones, which bind
DNA independently of sequence. Conversely, histones
and other proteins likely influence ORC binding to DNA,
although the relevant mechanisms remain obscure. In this
study we used genome-wide location analysis to identify
with high accuracy about 500 loci that bind ORC and/or
Mcm2p proteins. Within ~70% of these sites we identified
DNA sequences that match the consensus for ORC binding, and confirmed that about 80% were required for ARS
function. Thus, we have defined the exact position of most
ORC binding sites throughout the genome. These findings
represents an important contribution that should facilitate future studies of how the interaction between ORC
and other chromatin components influences replication
origin function, as well as the possibility that ORC regulates chromatin structure or nuclear architecture.

HMM-MOG model
A Hidden Markov Model with Mixture of Gaussians
(HMM-MOG) was used to fit the data (Figure 1B). The
complete parameter set of the model can be described as
λ = (π, A, B, P). Let Q1 represent the non-enriched state
and Q2 represent the enriched state, π = (π1,π2) gives the
initial probability of the two states. A = {a11 a12; a21 a22}
denotes the transition probabilities between the two
states: aij is the probability of a transition from state Qi to
state Qj. B={Y1, Y2} is the emission distribution, with
Y1~N(μ1,σ12) describing M values of non-enriched probes
and Y2~N(μ2, σ22) describing those of enriched probes.
The emission distribution for each state is a mixture of
these two Gaussians, but with different mixture proportions described by P = {p11, p12; p21 p22}. The idea is essentially to allow a proportion p21 of non-enriched probes in
an enriched region and a proportion p12 of enriched
probes in a non-enriched region.

Methods

The purpose of including the mixture is to overcome two
typical types of error in a ChIP-chip experiment: (1) In
non-enriched regions, some probes might behave similar
to typical probes in enriched regions, due to possible
cross-hybridization; this behavior will cause spikes for a
small number of probes. (2) In enriched regions, some
probes have weak signals comparable to typical probes in
non-enriched regions, due to low hybridization efficiency,
non-specificity, etc. These two types of error will occasionally cause improper transitions in a standard HMM (without the mixture) that result in false positive predictions or
site breakage. Allowing some amount of false positive
probes and some amount of false negative probes makes
the HMM more robust to probe failures.

Genome-wide location analysis
ORC and MCM2 binding sites were identified using
genome wide location analysis [24,60]. Target DNA from
strain OAy470 was obtained by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) as described [44]. ORC-bound DNA was
isolated from cells arrested with nocodazole (10 μg/mL)
for 3 hours at 23°C using anti-ORC polyclonal antibody
(1:500) [61]. Mcm2p-bound DNA was isolated from cells
arrested in G1 phase with 8.3 ng/mL α-factor (Sigma) for
4 hours at 23°C using anti-Mcm2p antibody (1:50, Santa
Cruz). Immunoprecipitated DNA, as well as non-enriched
total DNA, was amplified using ligation-mediated-PCR
(LM-PCR). Enriched and total DNAs were end-labeled
with Cy5 and Cy3, respectively, and co-hybridized to an
array designed and synthesized by NimbleGen Systems,
Inc. This array contained 124,991 50 bp oligonucleotides
tiled every 80 bp across the S. cerevisiae genome, present
in triplicate. DNA end-labeling, hybridization, and scanning were performed at NimbleGen Systems, Inc., which
provided the final text file of foreground signal intensities.
Normalization
The Cy5 and Cy3 foreground signals were converted to log
ratio of enrichment defined as M = log2Cy5 - log2Cy3 and
log intensity defined as A = (log2Cy5 + log2Cy3)/2 for
each spot. Global loess normalization was applied to
remove the systematic effect seen at low intensities on
transformed data (see Additional file 13). The normalized
M values within the three replicated blocks are highly correlated (ρ ≈ 0.74) for both ORC and Mcm2p. For each
probe, the median of the three replicates was used for further analysis.

The HMM parameters can be given empirically or estimated from data using the well-known Baum-Welch algorithm for finding the maximum likelihood estimates
(MLE) (cf. Rabiner 1989)[62]. To better estimate (π, A, B),
we empirically set p12= 6% (false positive probes) and p21
= 1% (false negative probes). Experimental tests show that
small changes in p12 and p21 do not change the results significantly. A Viterbi algorithm is used to decode the most
probable state sequence to identify unique enriched
regions. Because the parameters estimated from the data
vary among different chromosomes (see Additional file
1), we standardized all M values to their corresponding Z
values to facilitate further comparison.
Peak identification
The Z values were smoothed using a three-probe window
over six rounds, which corresponds to a weighted average
of 13 probes (~1 kb, which corresponds to the average size
of ChIP DNA fragments). The weight distribution is
approximately 0.001 : 0.008 : 0.029: 0.069 : 0.123 : 0.173
: 0.193 : 0.173 : 0.123 : 0.069 : 0.029 : 0.008 : 0.001. A

peak is defined by a continuous increase in the smoothed
Z value (sZ) for at least five probes followed by a decrease
of sZ for another five probes. For each enriched region we
report only one peak (with the largest smoothed Z value)
every 3 kb. This length was empirically chosen based on
analysis of the length of peaks in enriched regions for
known ARSs. For long HMM-defined regions (6% of
total) multiple peaks were identified. The strength of each
peak is defined as the average Z-value (avgZ) for 13
probes, covering ~1 kb. Each HMM region is denoted by
the identifying protein(s) and a peak number (e.g. ORCMCM2-34). If multiple peaks were identified in a region,
an additional number is given (e.g. ORC-MCM2-33-1 and
ORC-MCM2-33-2).
Motif finding and building an EACS+B1 positional weight
matrix
De novo motif finding was carried out separately on ORCMCM2, ORC-only, and MCM2-only sites using BioProspector with the recommended significance level of p = 2.9
× 10-7 (Z value = 5) [63]. A motif length of 17 bp was chosen based on the following prior information: (1) A de
novo motif finding study on the pro-ARS data set [24]
tested a range of motif lengths and showed that 17 bp is
the optimum length for retrieving ACSs from the data
[22,40]; (2) A previous study also described a 17 bp ACS
motif [1,20,21]; (3) The alignment of 31 experimentally
verified ACSs shows that these 17 bp are above the 95%
quantile (0.17 bits) of the null distribution (estimated
from 31 random sequences of 10 kb). Interestingly, the
alignment also reveals that the 24th, 31st, 32nd and 33rd
positions are significant, where the 32nd and 33rd positions had been previously mapped as B1 element contacted by ORC in ARS1 [38]. Thus we chose to form a twoblock motif (named EACS+B1) composed of a 17 bp
EACS followed by a 3 bp B1 exactly 13 bp apart (omitting
24th position). A gapped PWM was built on the alignment. We used LOD score to measure the similarity of a
test sequence to EACS+B1. Suppose the sequence we are
examining is a1a2...a33. The likelihood of this sequence
under the PWM, assuming it is an independent trials
model, is

P(a1a2 ...a33 ) = f1,a1 f2,a2 ... f17,a17 f31,a31 f32,a32 f33,a33 ,
where fi ,ai is the probability of observing base ai in position i in the PWM. The corresponding probability under
the background model is

P(a1a2 ...a33 ) = qa1 qa2 ...qa17 qa31 qa32 qa33 ,
where qai is the genomic frequency of base ai. The loglikelihood is defined as

LOD =

∑

i =1,2...17,31,32,33

log

fi ,ai

.

The LOD score was converted to a p-value based on the
null distribution generated by scanning EACS+B1
throughout chromosome VI, excluding all identified
ARSs. Sensitivity was obtained by a three-fold cross-validation. Briefly, the 31 ACSs were divided randomly into
subgroups of 10, 10, and 11 ACSs, and each subgroup was
scored by the PWM with parameters estimated from the
other two subgroups. The number of ACSs with scores
above a chosen threshold divided by 31 indicates the sensitivity.
The inter motif similarity between motif A and B is
defined as

S( A, B) = 1 −

∑ ∑ fi, j − fiBj ,
,
2W i =1 j =1

where W is the motif length, fiAj and fiBj are the observed

,
frequency of base j at position i in motif A and B respectively. The similarity is between 0 and 1; multiplying by
100 gives the similarity as a percentage.
Determination of ARS and ACS function
ARS activity was determined by testing the ability of a
sequence of interest to confer replication to a plasmid otherwise lacking a functional yeast ARS as described by
Wyrick et al. [24], or by a co-transformation approach that
takes advantage of yeast's high frequency of homologous
recombination. For the latter method, the sequence of
interest was amplified from yeast genomic DNA using
primers that each contains 20 bp of homology to the
sequence of interest and 40 bp of homology to either end
of a gapped CEN4/URA3 vector lacking an ARS. The
amplified product was co-transformed into yeast (ura3-1)
with the gapped vector, and transformants were selected
on -URA. A high frequency of transformation depended
on the presence of an ARS sequence in the amplified DNA,
while colony size reflected the efficiency of ARS function.
For classification, ARS305 was used as the standard for
normal ARS function and ARS604 as representative of a
weak ARS. Weak ARSs exhibit a high frequency of transformation, but form smaller colonies than cells harboring
ARS305, requiring about three days, rather than two, to
form a colony ~3 mm in diameter. Very weak ARSs also
showed a high frequency of transformation, but colonies
were small after three days and grew slowly upon restreaking. These assays were performed in duplicate.

To test the requirement of potential ACSs for ARS function, PCR primers were designed to amplify the ARS

region in two fragments each of which has an endpoint in
the 11 bp ACS. The ACS was replaced with a restriction site
to allow ligation of the two fragments. The distal ends of
these two fragments also contained introduced restriction
sites for ligation into a vector lacking yeast ARS function.
If deletion of an ACS resulted in loss of the high transformation frequency of the ARS, the ACS was denoted as
functional.
