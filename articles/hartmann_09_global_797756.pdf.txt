Signaling and alternative splicing response to insulin and wingless activation using splicing-sensitive microarrays shows distinct but over-

Abstract
Background: Despite the prevalence and biological relevance of both signaling pathways and
alternative pre-mRNA splicing, our knowledge of how intracellular signaling impacts on alternative
splicing regulation remains fragmentary. We report a genome-wide analysis using splicing-sensitive
microarrays of changes in alternative splicing induced by activation of two distinct signaling
pathways, insulin and wingless, in Drosophila cells in culture.
Results: Alternative splicing changes induced by insulin affect more than 150 genes and more than
50 genes are regulated by wingless activation. About 40% of the genes showing changes in
alternative splicing also show regulation of mRNA levels, suggesting distinct but also significantly
overlapping programs of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Distinct functional sets
of genes are regulated by each pathway and, remarkably, a significant overlap is observed between
functional categories of genes regulated transcriptionally and at the level of alternative splicing.
Functions related to carbohydrate metabolism and cellular signaling are enriched among genes
regulated by insulin and wingless, respectively. Computational searches identify pathway-specific
sequence motifs enriched near regulated 5' splice sites.
Conclusions: Taken together, our data indicate that signaling cascades trigger pathway-specific
and biologically coherent regulatory programs of alternative splicing regulation. They also reveal
that alternative splicing can provide a novel molecular mechanism for crosstalk between different
signaling pathways.

Background

Signaling pathways present a major mechanism by which
cells communicate during development and as part of the

normal physiology of organisms. A relatively small number of
signaling pathways have been shown to regulate a large repertoire of developmental and cellular processes ranging from

axis formation in the early embryo to complex immune
responses. The major signaling pathways have been shown to
be remarkably conserved in their components and general
biological role from insects and worms to mammals [1-3]. To
exert their diverse functions, these pathways are used reiteratively, mainly by regulating different transcriptional programs depending on the cellular context. The mechanisms
underlying signal-regulated transcription often involve the
modification of signal-transducing molecules and downstream components, ultimately affecting the potency of transcriptional regulators. Positive- and negative-acting cisregulatory sequences influencing transcription have been
characterized in the promoters of target genes, with targets of
the same pathway sharing similar sequence motifs (reviewed
in [4-8]).
The process of alternative pre-mRNA splicing expands the
information content of higher eukaryotic genomes by generating multiple mature mRNAs from a single primary transcript, often with functional consequences [9-11]. It is
currently clear that alternative splicing affects more than 80%
of human and over 40% of Drosophila genes [12-14]. An
increasing number of diseases are linked to misregulation of
splicing or alternative splicing, emphasizing the importance
of this process in the development and homeostasis of organisms [15]. Alternative splicing can affect the 5' untranslated
region (UTR), open reading frame, or 3'UTR of the transcripts. Changes in the open-reading frame usually affect the
protein structure, but can also regulate mRNA and protein
abundance by including exons that contain premature-stop
codons, which can trigger nonsense-mediated decay [16-19].
Changes in the 3' and 5'UTRs have been associated with
translational efficiency and mRNA stability and can change
the accessibility of microRNAs to their target sites [20].
The splicing process is catalyzed by the complex molecular
machinery of the spliceosome, composed of uridine-rich
small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles and more than 100
additional proteins [21,22]. Splicing regulatory factors,
including members of the Serine and Arginine-rich (SR) and
heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particle (hnRNP) protein
families, modulate splice-site choice through their direct or
indirect association with RNA regulatory sequence elements
(splicing enhancers and silencers) present in introns and
exons and influence recognition of the splice sites by the spliceosome [10,23].
Compared with the widespread effects documented on transcriptional regulation, little is known about the global impact
of signaling cascades on alternative splicing (reviewed in [2426]). Only a handful of examples of signal-induced alternative
splicing have been identified and analyzed in detail. For
example, cell depolarization activates calcium/calmodulindependent protein kinase type IV (CaMK IV), which represses
a number of exons associated with a particular RNA sequence
known as CaRRE responsive element [27-29]. Phorbol ester

treatment of T cells promotes skipping of variable exons in
the CD45 tyrosine phosphatase and inclusion of exon v5 in
CD44 transcripts [30,31]. In both cases, exonic sequences
have been identified that mediate these effects. In the case of
CD45 exon 4, this element binds three hnRNP proteins (L, E2
and I) and acts by blocking the transition of pre-spliceosomes
to fully assembled spliceosomes [32,33]. In the case of CD44
exon v5, a composite enhancer/silencer sequence mediates
the repressive effects of hnRNP A1 and the activating effects
of the RNA binding protein Sam68 upon its phosphorylation
by ERK under conditions of T cell activation [34-36]. These
examples illustrate how activation of signaling pathways can
lead to a range of effects on alternative splicing regulation
through distinct molecular mechanisms, including posttranslational modifications of splicing factors that change
their RNA binding properties, activities or subcellular localization [25,35,37].
One outstanding question, however, is to what extent signaling pathways deploy coherent programs of post-transcriptional regulation that coordinate and specify cellular
phenotypes. T cell activation, for example, leads to changes in
10-15% of alternative splicing analyzed using splicing-sensitive microarrays, with the regulated genes representing a distinct set of genes and functions from those regulated at the
level of transcript abundance [38].
To address this question, this study focuses on how two very
different signaling pathways, the insulin and wingless pathways, affect alternative splicing regulation using a genomewide approach. In Drosophila, major signaling pathways
have been intensively studied and dissected both genetically
as well as molecularly using tissue culture and in vivo systems. The insulin pathway governs metabolic changes and
has been linked to growth and life span, whereas the canonical wingless pathway is involved in a diverse range of developmental decisions. While stimulation of cells with insulin
induces a widespread response mediated by a cascade of protein phosphorylation events, activation of the canonical wingless pathway triggers a more linear response focused on
transcriptional changes [39-44]. Our data document that
both insulin and wingless pathway activation induce multiple
changes in alternative splicing, affecting genes with functions
coherent with the distinct roles of these pathways in vivo.
Bioinformatic analyses of the target genes identified two
sequence motifs enriched near regulated 5' splice sites. Our
results illustrate how signaling pathways can trigger a coherent set of alternative splicing events relevant for cell growth
and differentiation of diverse cell types.

Dashed lines represent cell and nuclear membranes. C and N indicate cytoplasm and nucleus, respectively. Stimulation of insulin signaling from 0-8 h was
monitored by western blotting using an anti-phospho-Akt antibody (left panel). Activation of the wingless pathway, achieved through RNA interference
(RNAi)-mediated depletion of axin (axn), resulted in the nuclear accumulation of Armadillo (Arm) as assessed by western blot analysis and activation of a
known target gene, naked cuticle (nkd) monitored by RT-PCR (right lower panel). Amplification of tubulin (tub) transcripts served as loading control. The

in turn activates dAkt kinase, which triggers a wide variety of
responses and effects on other pathways (Figure 1a) [45,46].
Drosophila S2 cells were treated with 30 g/ml human insulin and pathway activation was monitored using a phosphoepitope specific antibody against phosphorylated dAKt
kinase. Phospho-dAKt was observed as soon as 20 minutes
after insulin treatment (not shown) and persisted for at least
8 hours, consistent with previous studies (Figure 1a, bottom
left) [47]. Guided by previous analysis of transcriptional targets [48,49], and to allow RNA turnover and minimize indirect effects after insulin activation, total RNA was isolated 5
hours after insulin treatment.
Activation of the canonical wingless pathway stabilizes Armadillo, the Drosophila beta-catenin homologue, preventing its
degradation by a multiprotein complex containing axin. This
results in the nuclear accumulation of Armadillo which,
together with LEF/TCF transcription factors, regulates transcription of target genes (Figure 1a) [8,50]. Efficient activation of the wingless pathway can be achieved by reducing the
levels of axin mRNA by RNA interference for 3-4 days [41].
Treatment of S2 cells with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
against axin for 4 days resulted in a significant increase in the
levels of Armadillo protein and of one of its regulated mRNA
targets (naked cuticle (nkd); Figure 1a, bottom right). For our
analysis, total RNA was isolated at this 4 day time point.
To monitor transcriptional and alternative splicing changes
induced by activation of the insulin and wingless pathways, a
custom-designed microarray platform was employed featuring probes for all Drosophila genes for which different mRNA
isoforms generated by alternative splicing have been
described [51]. Three biological replicates of total RNA isolated after pathway activation or controls (untreated cells for
insulin, control dsRNA for wingless) were purified, reverse
transcribed into cDNA and labeled with Cy5 or Cy3 fluorochromes; after hybridization of the cDNA to the microarray,
the ratio of fluorescence between the Cy5 and Cy3 signals was
measured, normalized and a Z-score (measuring the statistical confidence of the fold-change observed in the microarrays) was determined for the three biological replicates [51].
As expected, activation of either signaling pathway in S2 cells
led to a significant number of transcriptional changes (Figure
1b), with 149 genes affected by activation of the insulin pathway and 85 genes affected by wingless activation. The transcriptional effects detected by the microarray were
independently validated using quantitative real-time PCR for
eight genes of each pathway, with validation rates of over
90%. Figure 1c shows validation of predicted transcriptional
up- and down-regulation for three genes in each pathway.
Log2 ratios refer to the changes in mRNA abundance determined by real-time PCR. While some of the detected changes
had been reported previously (for example, notum, frizzled
2), the majority of the changes observed in our array experi-

ments represent novel target genes of the insulin and wingless pathways (Additional data file 1).

Numerous changes in alternative splicing patterns
upon insulin and wingless activation
To monitor changes in alternative splicing, the microarrays
contain probes covering each reported exon-exon junction
(splice-junction), both constitutive (present in all annotated
isoforms) or alternative (specific of only particular isoforms),
as well as exon-specific probes (Figure 2a) [51]. This design
allowed us to monitor a variety of alternative splicing events,
including cassette exons, alternative 5' and 3' splice sites,
alternative first exon usage (indicative of alternative promoters) and alternative 3' termination sites. An important issue
in splicing microarray analysis is to distinguish real splicing
changes from changes in transcripts caused by a quantitative
change in gene expression. We define a splicing change as a
replicated change in the relative signal associated with a
splice junction probe between two conditions, which is statistically distinguishable (through its Z score) from the signals
from other probes in the array and from the average change
of all other probes monitoring other splice junctions and exon
probes (constitutive or alternative) in the same transcript
(which we assume reflects overall expression levels). A significant number of changes in splice junction probes were
observed upon activation of either pathway and, as observed
for transcriptional changes, activation by insulin resulted in
more extensive changes than activation of the wingless pathway (Figure 2b). Over 150 genes showed changes in at least
one splice junction in insulin-treated cells and 54 genes
showed splice junction changes upon wingless pathway activation (Additional data file 2). Interestingly, a similar fraction
(around 40%) of the genes showing changes in alternative
junction probes also showed changes in general expression of
the gene (see below). In these cases, the fold differences
between probes monitoring transcriptional changes and
alternative splicing changes were, however, sufficiently significant as to document the occurrence of changes in splicing
patterns. To validate the changes in alternative splicing predicted by the microarray results, quantitative RT-PCR assays
were performed using two primer pairs, one monitoring
expression of constitutive exons (that is, general transcript
levels) and another pair measuring changes in exon-exon
junctions, to monitor expression of particular isoforms (see
Materials and methods). As for the microarray data, changes
in alternative splicing were scored as significant differences
between changes in gene expression and changes in particular isoforms. Quantitative RT-PCR assays were carried out for
15 different genes, of which 11 (70%) were validated. Figure 3
shows the results obtained for six of these genes and their
associated alternative splicing events.
The microarray contains approximately the same number of
constitutive and alternative splice junction probes. As
expected, a larger number of alternative splice junction
probes showed changes upon activation of the insulin and

wingless pathways compared with constitutive junction
probes. The number of constitutive probes showing changes
after gene expression normalization was, however, significant
(up to 30%, not included in our analysis), suggesting that
some of these junction probes may monitor non-annotated
alternative isoforms. Indeed, RNA analyses using semi-quantitative RT-PCR detected novel isoforms for 3 of the 15 genes
analyzed (data not shown).
Figure 2b shows the distribution of alternative splicing
classes among the changes observed upon activation of the
insulin and wingless pathways, as well as the distribution of
alternative splicing classes among the splicing events featured in the whole microarray. The overall distribution (total,
insulin, wingless) is similar for intron retention events (5%,
5%, 4%), exon skipping (11%, 13%, 14%), complex exon skipping events (14%, 13%, 16%) and a combination of alternative
3'- and 5'-splice-site events (2%, 2%, 4%). Changes in alternative splicing induced by these signaling pathways seem to
affect a lower proportion of alternative 3' splice sites (11%,
6%, 6%) and alternative terminal exons (5%, 2%, 3%) while
certain increases in alternative first exons is observed, at least
for insulin (33%, 39%, 35%) (Figure 2c). The latter could be
due to changes in promoter usage as a consequence of transcriptional changes induced by activation of these pathways.

Indeed, 40% of the genes showing changes in splice junction
also show changes at the transcriptional level, suggesting a
link between transcription and splicing in genes regulated by
these signaling pathways. Interestingly, however, the use of
alternative first exons is not systematically linked to transcriptional changes: only 30% of insulin genes or 36% of
wingless genes using alternative promoters also show overall
changes in transcript abundance (data not shown). This suggests that qualitative changes in transcript structure and
splicing patterns, rather than quantitative changes in transcript abundance, are a frequent regulatory outcome of activation of these pathways. For about 7% of the genes with
changes in alternative promoter usage, changes in alternative
splicing are observed that affect regions of the pre-mRNA
located at a significant distance from the promoters, suggesting the possibility that promoter choice can have durable consequences on splice site choices. Taken together, these
observations are consistent with the emerging concept that
coupling between transcription and splicing can influence
changes in alternative pre-mRNA processing [52,53] and suggest that co-transcriptional splicing can play a mechanistic
role in mediating the effects of insulin and wingless on alternative splicing.

Validation of microarray-predicted changes in splice junctions using quantitative RT-PCR
Validation of microarray-predicted changes in splice junctions using quantitative RT-PCR. Examples of alternative splicing patterns regulated by (a) insulin
and (b) wingless signaling are shown. For each gene, a primer pair was designed to amplify a constitutive part of the transcript, thus monitoring general
changes in transcription (exp). In addition, primer pair(s) in which one of the primers covers a splice junction were used to amplify and monitor changes in
expression of particular isoforms, as indicated. Changes in splice junctions were evaluated relative to the change in gene transcription. RT-PCR results are
presented as log2 ratio of eCp values obtained under conditions of pathway activation and controls. The corresponding Z-score values from the
microarray prediction are indicated below the graphs for each event. Various classes of alternative splicing events are detected, including alternative first
exons, alternative 5' or 3' splice sites, cassette and mutually exclusive exons and more complex patterns. In some cases, expression changes are not
significant and alternative splicing changes are detected in the absence of significant changes in expression (for example, wdb, cg2201, trx, stat92E). In
others, changes in splice junctions are clearly distinct from changes in expression (for example, cg14207) or even occur in the opposite direction (for
example, babo). In some instances, changes in one splice junction probe monitoring a particular spliced isoform are not reciprocated by converse changes
in probes monitoring the alternatively spliced product. This suggests the existence of additional processing pathways. Indeed, semi-quantitative RT-PCR
using primers external to some of the alternatively spliced regions frequently detects the existence of additional, non-annotated isoforms (data not
shown).

Functional overlap of genes regulated at the levels of
transcription and alternative splicing
In an attempt to address the functional relevance of the
observed changes in alternative splicing, gene ontology (GO)
overrepresentation analyses were carried out for the genes
that show transcriptional changes and changes inalternative
splicing and those showing exclusively changes in alternative
splicing, using as a reference the complete set of genes covered by the microarray. GO terms were subsequently grouped
in broad functional related categories and the proportion of
enriched GO terms compared to the overall number of
enriched terms for each pathway is represented in Tables 1
and 2. One first insight was that the two pathways showed
distinguishable profiles of GO categories, both for genes experiencing transcriptional changes and for those genes showing

changes in alternative splicing. These results suggest that, as
is the case for transcriptional regulation, alternative splicing
deploys a distinct regulatory program characteristic of each
signaling pathway. A second conclusion was that some of the
most populated functional categories of enriched GO terms
are shared between transcriptional and post-transcriptional
regulation, and these shared categories are characteristic for
each pathway. In the case of wingless-regulated genes, functions related to signal transduction (including lipid - for
example, phospholipid - metabolism) as well as learning,
memory and olfaction-related genes were among the
enriched categories, at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Consistent with one key function of
insulin signaling, genes with functions in carbohydrate,
amino acid and intermediary metabolism constitute a promi-

GO overrepresentation analysis of the function (biological process) of genes regulated transcriptionally and at the level of alternative splicing by
insulin. GO terms were grouped in broad functional categories and the number of enriched GO terms in each category is indicated. Also indicated is
the percentage that each number of enriched GO terms represents from the total number of enriched terms (indicated at the top) for the classes of

nent category of insulin-regulated genes, both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. Similar gene ontology
enrichment was observed when the analysis included genes
showing changes only in alternative splicing but not in transcript levels. The broad category of genes involved in developmental processes and decisions shows changes for both
pathways and regulatory mechanisms, although GO terms
characteristic of each pathway (for example, development of
the tracheal system for insulin) could be identified. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that the changes in alternative splicing triggered by insulin and wingless are
biologically meaningful and functionally coherent with the
well-studied transcriptional regulation programs deployed by
these signaling pathways (see Discussion).

Signal-regulated alternative splicing as another level of
pathway regulation and crosstalk between pathways
Signaling by the wingless pathway plays a role in diverse
developmental processes and frequently involves autoregulation and extensive crosstalk with other signaling pathways.
For example, patterning of the wing imaginal disc is achieved
mainly through the interplay of the transforming growth factor (TGF), Wingless, Notch and Hedgehog signaling pathways [39,54-56]. Therefore, we considered the possibility that
modulation of pathway activity through autoregulation, or
crosstalk between pathways could also be affected by changes
in alternative splicing of the genes involved. Indeed, signaling
genes were among the enriched categories of differentially
spliced genes upon activation of the wingless pathway (Table
1) and changes in alternative splicing of several key genes
involved in wingless signaling, including the wingless receptor frizzled2 (fz2) [57] and the wingless modifier rotund (rn),
were found [58] (Tables 3 and 4). Equally interesting,

changes in alternative splicing of genes important for TGF
and JAK-STAT signaling pathways were also detected (Tables
3 and 4), including an alternative splicing event in the activin
receptor baboon, which is predicted to affect ligand binding,
and another functionally important event in the Signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 92E (stat92E)
[59], which affects dimerization of the protein on its target
DNA (Figure 3b). Taken together, these results show that
activation of the wingless pathway results in alternative splicing changes that can mediate or modulate the wingless pathway itself or the crosstalk between pathways.

Pathway-specific enrichment of sequence motifs in the
vicinity of regulated junctions
A computational search for sequence motifs enriched near
splice junctions regulated by the insulin and wingless pathways was carried out. For each of the two sets of differentially
regulated junctions, intronic regions of 50 nucleotides flanking each junction were selected, together with the orthologous regions in the other 11 Drosophila species [60]. Motif
searches within each set of sequences were carried out using
MEME [61] and PHYLOGIBBS [62] software, aiming at identifying motifs enriched in each set of sequences for which

there is evidence of phylogenetic conservation. This generated a panel of putative motifs [63]. Two significant motifs
were identified, a uridine-rich motif associated with junctions
regulated by insulin (identified through PHYLOGIBBS; Figure 4a) and an adenosine-rich motif associated with junctions
regulated by the wingless pathway (identified through
MEME; Figure 4b). These motifs were significantly enriched
compared with their distribution in sets of control regions of
comparable size derived from either constitutive or non-constitutive junctions that did not show differential regulation by
the wingless or insulin pathways [63]. We propose that these
motifs are part of the cis-acting elements through which signaling pathways regulate alternative pre-mRNA splicing.

Discussion

High-throughput methods for gene expression analysis are
providing unprecedented opportunities to study cellular programs of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.
Although the detection of splicing variants requires an additional level of sophistication in data analysis, important new
insights into splicing regulation have been gathered through
the use of large scale sequence alignments, microarrays and

Overrepresented sequence motifs present at the 5' end of intronic regions associated with splice junctions regulated by the (a) wingless and (b) insulin
pathways. Motifs were derived from a dataset of sequences corresponding to the 50 nucleotides of introns flanking splice junctions that change upon
activation of a signaling pathway, as well as the corresponding regions in the same intron of the other 11 Drosophila species. Motifs were identified using
MEME and PHYLOGIBBS software and the specificity of the enrichment assessed with a set of control sequences derived from constitutive and alternative
splice junctions that do not change upon activation of the signaling pathway. A detailed account of motifs and statistical assessment of their significance can
be found in [63]. Represented are the relative frequencies of each nucleotide at each position in the nine nucleotide motifs. Genes containing the junctions

proteomics (reviewed in [9,10,64]). One common theme
emerging from these pioneering studies is that changes in
alternative splicing and changes in transcription affect largely
independent sets of genes [38,65,66]. For example, analysis
of pairs of major mouse tissues using genome-wide splicingsensitive microarrays concluded that only 15-20% of genes
regulated at the level of splicing were also regulated at the
level of transcript abundance, an overlap that may not differ
from statistical random sampling [65]. The same conclusion
was reached in a comparative analysis of human and chimpanzee tissues [64]. Similarly, the majority of genes showing
changes in alternative splicing in Jurkat cells activated by
phorbol esters do not show changes in transcript levels [38].
The implication of these results is that programs of gene regulation that induce transcriptional changes and those that
modulate the levels of splice variants are established independently, perhaps to coordinate different aspects of cell differentiation, response to environmental stimuli, and so on. In
contrast, a study using a splicing array design dedicated to
1,500 genes relevant for prostate cancer showed that 60-70%
of genes experiencing changes in splicing in prostate tumor
biopsies also showed changes in transcript levels [67,68].
These different figures may arise from differences in experimental setup or in the sensitivity of the analytical methods
utilized, but they may also reflect different extents of coupling

between transcription and RNA processing in different biological situations (for example, coupling may be more prominent in prostate gene regulation or in disease samples than in
terminally differentiated tissues).
Our results suggest an intermediate situation for the response
to signaling pathways in Drosophila cells. We find that 40%
of genes changing in alternative splicing also show changes in
transcript levels upon activation of the insulin pathway or the
wingless cascade (Figure 2b). Given the significant transcriptional effects of activation of these pathways, it is perhaps not
surprising that coupling between transcription and splicing
will be prominent in signaling responses. Coupling can reflect
effects on alternative splicing brought about by quantitative
changes in transcriptional level of a gene. In these cases,
changes in alternative splicing may be caused by titration of
limiting splicing factors, differences in splicing factors
recruited co-transcriptionally, or changes in transcription
elongation rates. Solid precedents exist for such forms of
transcriptional/post-transcriptional coupling (reviewed in
[53]). In addition, changes in spliced isoforms can be linked
to selection of alternative promoters and transcription start
sites. Our results suggest that coupling of transcription and
alternative splicing upon activation of signaling pathways in
Drosophila employ both changes in transcript structure

Genome Biology 2009,

(alternative promoter usage, which apparently can have longrange effects on downstream events) as well as changes in
transcript levels. The latter show also similar average fold
changes in transcript levels and in splice site selection. These
changes are relatively modest (around twofold) but consistent across experimental setups, timings and pathways [38].
Coordinated changes in transcription and alternative splicing
may be important to quickly deploy changes in gene expression that will help the cell to adapt to new functions induced
by insulin or wingless stimulation. Another mechanism by
which alternative splicing can influence transcript levels is
the generation of premature stop codon-containing transcripts through alternative splicing, which leads to RNA degradation through the Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD)
pathway [69]. This could affect 7-9% of alternative splicing
changes in our dataset, although evidence against widespread
coupling between alternative splicing and NMD has been
reported in mammalian cells [65].
A key question is the extent to which these changes in alternative splicing are biologically meaningful, an issue relevant for
alternatively spliced transcripts in general [9-11]. Previous
genome-wide studies stress the largely independent functions
of genes regulated at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels [38,64,65]. The implication of these results is
that different layers of gene regulation deploy different programs of functional activities. For example, in response to
phorbol ester-mediated T cell activation, transcriptional
changes target genes associated with immune response and
cytoskeletal architecture, while alternative splicing changes
are often associated with regulation of the cell cycle [38].
Our results on both signaling pathways indicate that some
categories of enriched GO terms are distinct for transcription
and splicing regulation, consistent with these previous observations. The majority of the most populated categories of
enriched GO terms, however, show a substantial coincidence
between transcription and/or alternative splicing (Tables 1
and 2). This convergence of gene functions is a common feature of both pathways analyzed, despite the fact that the categories of genes regulated by each pathway are significantly
different. Insulin targets various genes involved in carbohydrate, amino acid and intermediary metabolism, consistent
with known functions of this hormone in cellular homeostasis. Wingless targets genes relevant for long-term potentiation, memory formation and olfaction, which is intriguing
given the non-neural phenotype of S2 cells. Additional functions include components and regulators of signaling pathways as well as membrane lipid metabolism (for example,
phospholipid metabolism, relevant to activation of various
signaling routes), which would be consistent with the morphogenetic functions of the pathway and also suggests a novel
layer of mechanisms for crosstalk between pathways (see
below).

Hartmann et al. R11.10

Why should insulin and wingless signaling put together a
coherent transcriptional and post-transcriptional program of
gene regulation targeting similar classes of genes, while terminally differentiated tissues and phorbol ester-induced T
cells deploy distinct regulatory programs affecting different
classes of genes? One obvious contributor to this difference is
the larger overlap/coupling between transcription and splicing in insulin and wingless signaling discussed above. Coherent gene functions, however, are also generally observed
between the subsets of genes that show changes in just alternative splicing (fourth columns in Tables 1 and 2). Furthermore, substantial overlap in functions remains upon removal
of genes showing changes in alternative promoter usage
(about 20% of the genes for either pathway) from the GO
analyses (Additional data file 3). Fast responses to insulin and
wingless stimulation may require a focused response that
exploits the repertoire of gene regulation mechanisms available to the cell to build up a change in cell phenotype or homeostasis. While differences in the experimental protocols
utilized to activate each pathway could influence the outcome
of our experiments, the similarity of the overall conclusions
obtained for the two pathways, which differ both in biological
function and in the range of their molecular effects, suggests
that deploying coherent functions in transcriptional and posttranscriptional programs may be a general feature of signaling cascades. In any case, our observations argue that full
understanding of the response to these and other signaling
pathways will require exploring both transcriptional and
post-transcriptional regulation.
Another relevant case can be made for the alternative splicing
changes induced by wingless activation on components of its
own pathway as well as other pathways, suggesting feedback
control and crosstalk between signaling routes. It is well
established that signaling pathways interact extensively to
achieve growth, differentiation and developmental patterning events in which wingless plays a pivotal role. For example,
in the wing imaginal disc, Wingless, Hedgehog and Decapentaplegic act as morphogens specifying cell-fates along the
axes [39,54,55,70,71]. It was shown that an enhancer-region
in the gene vestigial (vg), a selector gene that defines the wing
primordium, combines inputs from short-range Notch signaling across the dorso-ventral compartment boundary and
signals from the long-range morphogens Wingless and
Decapentaplegic ([56] and references therein). Another
prominent example is the eye imaginal disc, the precursor of
the eye. Temporal coordination of inputs from the Hedgehog,
Wingless, Decapentaplegic, Notch, Receptor Tyrosine Kinase
(RTK) and JAK-STAT signaling pathways pattern the eye
(reviewed in [72]). Using Drosophila genetics, it was shown
that the JAK/STAT pathway promotes the formation of the
eye field through repression of the wingless gene and that this
depends on Stat92E [73]. Our observation that wingless activation causes changes in alternative splicing of stat92E suggests the interesting possibility that the two pathways
influence each other through transcriptional and post-tran-

scriptional effects. It will be of great interest to investigate the
underlying molecular mechanisms and, more generally,
address the impact of alternative splicing regulation in these
pathways.
What could be the molecular mechanisms that mediate the
changes in alternative splicing triggered by insulin and wingless? Changes in the levels of general factors are known to
modulate splice site choice [10,23]. No clear changes in
expression or alternative splicing of the 90 RNA binding proteins featured in the array were observed upon activation of
either pathway. It is possible, however, that changes in subcellular localization of splicing factors alter their functional
levels in the nucleus [37]. These or other changes in activity of
splicing regulators are likely to be brought about by posttranslational modifications induced by signaling cascades.
Indeed, previous data suggest that both signaling cascades
possess the ability to regulate alternative splicing changes
through interactions or modifications of splicing factors. For
example, insulin in vertebrates has been shown to regulate
alternative splicing of protein kinase C (PKC)-beta through
phosphorylation of the SR protein Srp40 [74,75]. There is
also evidence for a role of beta-catenin, a wingless pathway
effector, in alternative splicing regulation: changes in betacatenin levels lead to alternative splicing changes, which may
be mediated by splicing factors that have been reported to
interact with beta-catenin [76,77].
Similar mechanisms, involving modifications of splicing regulators and the cis-acting sequences from which they act (Figure 4), are likely to mediate the changes in alternative splicing
reported here. Identification of widespread splicing changes
affecting genes with functions coherent with the distinct roles
of these pathways in vivo is an important first step to unravel
these mechanisms.

Conclusion

The results presented in this study document numerous
changes in alternative splicing triggered by activation of the
insulin or wingless signal transduction pathways in Drosophila cells in culture. These changes are pathway-specific
and affect genes with functions coherent with the distinct
roles of each pathway in vivo. Thus, carbohydrate, amino acid
and intermediary metabolism genes are enriched among the
targets of insulin, while components and modulators of signal
transduction are enriched among wingless targets, which,
interestingly, include also genes important for memory and
olfaction. Forty percent of genes showing alternative splicing
changes also showed changes in transcription, suggesting a
significant overlap and potential coupling between the two
processes upon signal cascade activation. Bioinformatic analyses of the target genes identified sequence motifs enriched
near regulated 5' splice sites specific for each pathway. Our
results argue that signaling pathways can trigger a coherent

set of alternative splicing changes that are relevant for cell
growth and differentiation.

Materials and methods
Cell culture assays, western blotting and RNA isolation
For insulin pathway activation, S2 cells were grown to exponential phase and 30 g/ml human insulin (Actrapid 100 Ul/
ml, Novo Nordisk, Madrid, Spain) was added to the cell
medium. Cells were harvested after 5 hours. The wingless
pathway was activated by treatment of 1.5 × 106 S2 cells with
15 g of axin dsRNA for 4 days as described [78]. For western
blotting, samples were fractionated by electrophoresis on 8%
denaturing polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane (Schleicher and Schuell, Dassel Germany) and
probed with anti-phospho-Akt (Ser473) antibody (1:1000;
Cell Signaling, Boston, MA, USA) or anti-armadillo antibody
(1: 400; N2 7A1, Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA, USA). Antibody detection was carried out using the ECL-detection kit
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden).
Total RNA was isolated from cells following the RNeasy Miniprep protocol (QIAGEN, Venlo, Netherlands) including
DNase treatment. The integrity of the RNA was controlled
using a Bioanalyzer and only RNA preparations with undetectable degradation of ribosomal RNA peaks were utilized for
further analyses.

Microarray experiments
Microarray hybridization, data acquisition and analysis were
performed as previously described [51]. In brief, cDNA was
generated from 15 g of total RNA with the incorporation of
aminoallyl-dUTP (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). cDNA was
then conjugated with Cy3/Cy5 mono-functional dye (Amersham, Uppsala, Sweden) and hybridized to custom 44k Agilent oligonucleotide arrays. After hybridization, arrays were
washed, scanned and images analyzed following the manufacturer's recommendations. General gene expression values
represent the average of log2 ratios for all the probes of a
locus. The net expression of a splice junction was calculated
by subtracting the average log2 expression of all junctions of
an isoform from the log2 expression ratio of that particular
junction. A Z-score was computed for each value [51] and a Zscore cutoff of 2 was used to consider changes as significant.
We define a splicing change as a consistent change in the relative signal associated with a splice junction probe between
two conditions, whose Z score is statistically distinguishable
from the signals from other probes in the array and from the
average change of all other probes monitoring other splice
junctions and exon probes in the same transcript. The array
data have been deposited in the GEO database
[GEO:GSE14085].

Primer design and quantitative RT-PCR
The design of primers for validation was carried out using the
public software primer3 [79]. Amplicons were approximately

Genome Biology 2009,

100 base pairs. To assess the general transcription level, a
primer pair was designed on constitutive exons, while a
primer pair covering the splice-junction was designed to validate changes in that junction. cDNA was synthesized using a
mixture of oligoT and random hexamer primers from 1 g of
total RNA using Supercript II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. Real-time PCR
was performed for 45 cycles using Lightcycler DNA Master
SYBRgreen I (Roche Applied Science, Pensberg, Germany) in
384-well plates using Lightcycler 480 (Roche). Efficiencies of
primer pairs were experimentally calculated and specificity of
primers was controlled using a melting curve. The log2 ratios
were calculated as described [80]. Individual PCR amplifications were carried out in triplicates and analyses included at
least three biological replicas.

Motif discovery
We retrieved 50-nucleotide-long intronic regions proximal to
the splice sites of every regulated splice junction and the corresponding orthologous sequences in the other 11 Drosophila
species using sequence alignments generated by MAVID [81].
MEME [61] and PHYLOGIBBS [62] were used to search for
putative common motifs. The statistical significance of each
motif was assessed against a corresponding collection of
motifs found using the same methods for deriving motifs
enriched in sets of control regions. These control regions were
retrieved separately from constitutive and non-constitutive
junctions mimicking the sample size and phylogenetic coverage of the sequences associated with the regulated junctions
(for additional information and statistics, see [63]).

Gene Ontology analysis
We used the latest Drosophila GO annotations provided by
the Bioconductor project version 2.4 through the annotation
package Org.Dm.eg.db version 2.2.6. We used the GOstats
package from Bioconductor to calculate the enrichment of GO
terms using the conditional hyper-geometric test [82]. The
gene universe is composed of all the genes represented on the
array. Overrepresentation analyses were performed for genes
regulated at the level of transcription, alternative splicing and
those genes with splicing, but no transcriptional changes for
each signaling pathway. Only categories with a hypergeometric p-value lower than 0.05 were considered.
