Abstract
Background: The CSL (CBF1/RBP-Jκ/Suppressor of Hairless/LAG-1) transcription factor family
members are well-known components of the transmembrane receptor Notch signaling pathway,
which plays a critical role in metazoan development. They function as context-dependent activators
or repressors of transcription of their responsive genes, the promoters of which harbor the
GTG(G/A)GAA consensus elements. Recently, several studies described Notch-independent
activities of the CSL proteins.
Results: We have identified putative CSL genes in several fungal species, showing that this family
is not confined to metazoans. We have analyzed their sequence conservation and identified the
presence of well-defined domains typical of genuine CSL proteins. Furthermore, we have shown
that the candidate fungal protein sequences contain highly conserved regions known to be required
for sequence-specific DNA binding in their metazoan counterparts. The phylogenetic analysis of the
newly identified fungal CSL proteins revealed the existence of two distinct classes, both of which
are present in all the species studied.
Conclusion: Our findings support the evolutionary origin of the CSL transcription factor family in
the last common ancestor of fungi and metazoans. We hypothesize that the ancestral CSL function
involved DNA binding and Notch-independent regulation of transcription and that this function
may still be shared, to a certain degree, by the present CSL family members from both fungi and
metazoans.

Background
The CSL (CBF1/RBP-Jκ/Suppressor of Hairless/LAG-1)
proteins compose a family of transcription factors essential for metazoan development [1,2]. They are present in
all metazoan genomes studied and show remarkable
sequence conservation across phylogeny. They localize
predominantly or exclusively in the cell nucleus where
they can either repress or activate transcription depending
on the context and the presence of various coregulators.

CSL proteins recognize a very tightly defined consensus
sequence GTG(G/A)GAA in target promoters. Their best
characterized function relates to the signaling pathway of
the transmembrane receptor Notch where they mediate
the effector nuclear step – activation of Notch-responsive
genes. The Notch pathway regulates metazoan embryonic
development, cell fate decisions and tissue boundaries
specifications [2,3]. Its deregulation is implicated in several diseases including cancer [4] and, in addition, several

viruses encode factors that misuse this pathway via interaction with CSL proteins [5].
CSL proteins are essential for the development of the
organism as a whole, however, they are dispensable at the
cellular level, because CSL knock-out cell lines can be
established and do not show any obvious abnormalities.
The mutant phenotypes of Notch and CSL genes do not
fully overlap, as CSL mutants show more severe developmental perturbations [2,6]. Recently, several studies
reported Notch-independent activities of CSL proteins
indicative of their involvement in yet other signaling
pathways [7-10]. In addition to the Notch pathwaydependent CSL proteins of the RBP-Jκ type, at least in
some metazoan species, CSL transcription factors called
RBP-L can be found, which are only beginning to be characterized. They are highly similar to the RBP-Jκ group but
seem to act exclusively in a Notch-independent manner.
Unlike the ubiquitous RBP-Jκ type proteins the expression
of RBP-L is confined to only a few tissue types [11,12].
In contrast to the generally accepted view, the presence of
CSL proteins seems not to be confined to metazoan
organisms and the Notch pathway. They are indeed
absent from plants but there were indications of CSL proteins in one fungal species – the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe [13]. We have attempted to confirm the
identity of CSL proteins in S. pombe and to further explore
the distribution of this transcription factor family in fungi.
We have documented the existence of fungal CSL proteins, which indicates that this family originated much
earlier in evolution than previously appreciated. We hope
that these findings will help to elucidate the CSL family
ancestral function in cells and to better understand their
complex engagements in metazoans.

Results
Identification of CSL genes in fungi
CSL transcription factors are generally considered a key
part of the Notch signaling pathway and as such a hallmark of metazoan organisms [2]. However, it was noted
earlier in the literature that distant CSL homologs may
also be found in the genome of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, an organism that lacks the Notch pathway [13]. This raises interesting questions regarding the
evolutionary origin as well as the ancestral function of the
CSL family. We have therefore conducted exhaustive
BLAST searches of publicly available sequence data (see
Methods) to asses the presence and conservation of CSL
family members in fungi. The results of these searches are
summarized in Table 1 (the fungal taxonomical nomenclature used in this article was taken from [14]). Nineteen
putative CSL genes were found in seven organisms, with
S. pombe and S. japonicus belonging to the Taphrinomycotina basal subphylum of ascomycetes, Rhizopus oryzae

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/233

representing the zygomycetes and Coprinus cinereus, Cryptococcus neoformans, Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Ustilago maydis belonging to the basidiomycetes. Protein
products of these genes contain motifs typical of the CSL
family (see below). It is likely that more CSL genes will be
found in these taxonomical groups as more genome
sequences become available. In contrast, no CSL
homologs could be found in either Saccharomycotina
(including the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae) or
Pezizomycotina, the later branching subphyla of ascomycetes.
Most of the candidates are hypothetical proteins with little or no annotation in the databases. Therefore, we have
first verified the quality of each ORF prediction (see Methods). The confidence of exon-intron structure predictions
in these less studied organisms is rather limited. Another
obstacle is posed by the degree of divergence among the
sequences together with the presence of multiple speciesand protein-specific insertions. Nevertheless, we were able
to construct three completely new gene predictions (designated SjCSL1 and SjCSL2 in S. japonicus, and PcCSL2 in
P. chrysosporium) as well as to identify mispredictions and/
or possible sequencing errors in other four genes (see
Additional files 1 and 2 for a more detailed description).
Our corrections comprised of intron inclusion/exclusion,
different splice-site selection and exon addition. Some of
the intron positions displayed inter-species conservation
which supported our predictions (data not shown). We
have also identified a less usual intron with a GC-AG
boundary in the R. oryzae RO3G_07636.1 gene. Such
introns were found in other fungi as well [15] and are generally a problem for gene prediction algorithms.
Typically, there are two CSL paralogs per genome, differing considerably in length and each belonging to a different class (see below). A notable exception is the genome
of R. oryzae which harbors seven CSL genes, three of them
being class F1 and four of them belonging to class F2.
Most candidate CSL proteins are predicted to be nuclear
which supports their putative functioning as transcription
factors (see bellow). SPCC736.08 of S. pombe is the only
protein predicted to have exclusively non-nuclear subcellular localization but it was shown experimentally to be
nuclear [16].
Sequence conservation of fungal CSL proteins
According to the C. elegans LAG-1 protein crystal structure,
the CSL fold is related to Rel-domain proteins, but is
uniquely composed of three distinct domains [17]. The
amino-terminal RHR-N (Rel-homology region) and central BTD (beta-trefoil domain) domains are involved in
DNA-binding. BTD serves also as an interaction platform
for Notch/SMRT coregulators. The carboxy-terminal RHRC domain displays lower conservation in metazoans and

its function is not yet clear; one possibility is its participation in Notch-independent regulation of transcription
[18].
We have used the Pfam protein domains database [19] to
search for CSL-specific domains in all our candidate
sequences and to identify any other known domains
present. The results are schematized in Fig. 1. The RHR-N
[Pfam:PF09271] and BTD [Pfam:PF09270] domains were
identified in all fungal sequences with high significance,
supporting the identity of our candidates as CSL family
members. However, the RHR-C [Pfam:PF01833] domain
could only be identified in RO3G_11583 and
RO3G_14587 from R. oryzae. A rather divergent RHR-C
domain was also found in S. japonicus SjCSL2 and two
more R. oryzae proteins, RO3G_06481 and RO3G_07636.
The lower degree of sequence conservation of RHR-C
noted in metazoans is thus even more pronounced in
fungi. No other conserved domains could be found,
despite the fact that the putative fungal CSL proteins are
typically significantly larger than their metazoan counterparts. The overall domain organization of the fungal proteins is the same as in metazoans. The increased size of the

fungal candidates was found to be caused by two factors.
First, in some proteins, there are pronounced extensions
of the amino-terminal part preceding the RHR-N domain.
This region is about 200 amino acids long in C. elegans
and gets much shorter in metazoan evolution. Its crystal
structure is not known. Second, there are multiple amino
acid insertions of varying length throughout the candidate
sequences (see below).
To gain better insight into the specifics of the fungal CSL
proteins, we have produced a multiple sequence alignment of all newly identified fungal sequences and selected
metazoan family members (see Methods and Additional
file 3). There are two sub-types of metazoan CSL proteins;
one is represented by the Notch-pathway protein RBP-Jκ
(CBF1, SuH, RBPSUH) and the other by the much less
known transcription factor RBP-L, the function of which
seems to be Notch-independent [11,12]. Both subtypes'
representatives were included in the alignment. The most
prominent feature of the resulting alignment is the presence of several highly conserved blocks of amino acids
separated by species- and protein-specific insertions.
These insertions are of considerable length in some cases

and are more pronounced in the class F2 proteins. They
are rich in amino acids proline, glycine, serine/threonine
and lysine/arginine. Overall sequence conservation is
highest in the RHR-N and BTD domains, including the
immediately following long β-strand (βC4) that was
shown to bridge all three CSL domains in the C. elegans
LAG-1 [17]. The conservancy of the βC4 linker suggests
that the CSL-specific arrangement between RHR-N and
BTD is also likely preserved in fungi. The C-termini typically contain only 1–2 well-alignable stretches that can be
identified as fragments of the RHR-C domain. The aminoterminal extensions preceding the RHR-N domain show
little if any sequence conservation. As mentioned above,
there are several regions located mostly in the RHR-N and
BTD domains, that show very high or even absolute
sequence conservation (see Fig. 2 and 3). It is notable that,
according to the crystallography data, all these conserved
blocks are involved in binding of the strictly defined CSL
consensus site on DNA [17]. With the sole exception of
the S. japonicus SjCSL2 protein (Q567H substitution corresponding to Q401 in C. elegans LAG-1, see Fig. 2), all
residues required for sequence specific binding of the
GTG(G/A)GAA response element are absolutely conserved in all fungal proteins, which strongly supports their
inclusion in the CSL family. The interactions of CSL pro-

teins with their coactivators Notch/EBNA2 and corepressors SMRT/NCoR and CIR have been mapped to and
around a hydrophobic pocket on the surface of BTD
[17,20-22]. Not surprisingly, the residues mediating these
interactions are generally not conserved in fungi,
although some of them are found in class F2 fungal CSL
proteins. However, the potential to form a hydrophobic
pocket in BTD seems to be preserved (data not shown).
Phylogenetic analysis of the CSL protein family
As noted earlier, there are usually two fungal CSL paralogs
per genome. We wanted to see whether these paralogs
cluster to some well-defined groups and what their relationship to the metazoan CSL family members is. For this
purpose, we have constructed an unrooted phylogenetic
tree for the regions that could be aligned with confidence,
that is, the RHR-N and BTD domains (see Methods and
Fig. 4). As expected, the fungal CSL proteins form two distinct classes, designated class F1 and F2, with each class
being represented in all fungal taxons included in the
analysis. It should be noted at this point that the positions
of S. pombe SPCC1223.13 and S. japonicus SjCSL2 proteins
are slightly ambiguous, branching off either immediately
before or after the class F2 core (data not shown). The
intra-class branch topology roughly follows the taxonom-

ical relations [23] with the notable exception of the divergent C. neoformans CNA01890 and CNBD3370 proteins.
It can be inferred from the branch lengths that the rate of
divergence among the fungal protein sequences is much
higher than in metazoa. Metazoan CSL proteins (designated class M) form a very coherent group that can be
divided to RBP-Jκ and RBP-L subgroups. The RBP-Jκ subgroup displays an especially low extent of divergence,
which may be due to their involvement in the developmentally critical Notch pathway. Of the two fungal CSL
classes the class F2 proteins show higher similarity to the
metazoan class M.

Discussion
The CSL family origin and distribution
To the best of our knowledge, there were only two brief
notions of CSL proteins existence outside metazoans up
to now. One paper showed Southern blot cross-hybridization of murine RBP-Jκ cDNA probe with S. pombe DNA
[24]. The significance of these results is, however, questionable, as the hybridizing chromosomal DNA fragments had lengths differing from that expected for either
of S. pombe CSL genes, SPCC736.08 and SPCC1223.13.
Potential CSL homologs in S. pombe were also mentioned
in the review of Lai [13], although no supporting evidence
was presented.

We have rigorously searched for CSL proteins in eukaryotic genomes from all kingdoms of life to map their distribution. Apart from the known metazoan proteins, we
have found no homologs in either plants or protozoa
(data not shown), however, we have succeeded in finding
CSL family members in several fungal species of the ascomycetes (the basal subphylum Taphrinomycotina), zygomycetes and basidiomycetes groups. These organisms
range in complexity from the simple unicellular fission
yeast to the macroscopic multicellular and highly differentiated C. cinereus. It is of notion that the presence of CSL
homologs in fungi is not universal as there are no representatives found in either of the later branching ascomycetal groups, Saccharomycotina, including the important
model organism S. cerevisiae, and Pezizomycotina. Our
data support the idea that the ancestral CSL gene originated in the last common ancestor of animals and fungi,
thus much earlier than previously assumed. This is in
accord with the absence of CSL family in such large groups
as plants and mycetozoa, that branched off earlier in evolution [25,26]. We hypothesize that the first CSL gene
might have been created from a Rel-type transcription factor gene by the insertion of a beta-trefoil domain-encoding DNA sequence in between the amino- and carboxyterminal Rel domains. Subsequently, a duplication event
took place in the fungal lineage creating the two CSL
classes we see today, class F2 being more alike the metazoan CSL proteins and class F1 being more fungi-specific

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/233

(see Fig. 4). We consider such explanation more likely
than the alternative, where the ancestral CSL gene would
both originate and undergo duplication in the common
ancestor of metazoans and fungi and one copy would be
soon lost again in the metazoan lineage.
Nevertheless, there have been independent losses of CSL
genes in the fungal branch. First, we failed to find any CSL
homologs in Encephalitozoon cuniculi (data not shown), a
parasitic microsporidian and a representative of a group
that is sister to fungi [25]. This fact is probably due to the
parasitic lifestyle of these organisms, which often leads to
pronounced gene eliminations [27]. Second, we have
found no evidence of CSL genes in chytridiomycetes (data
not shown), a likely polyphyletic group also basal to the
fungal lineage [14]. Finally, the CSL family is apparently
missing in the later branching ascomycetal fungi of the
Saccharomycotina and Pezizomycotina groups [23], suggestive of another gene loss(es). The losses may have
occurred during the transitions between saprophytic and
parasitic nutritional modes [14], indicating that the CSL
genes code for functions in fungi that are not universally
required in their life cycles. On the other hand, there have
been clade specific CSL genes multiplications in fungi
illustrated by the three class F1 and four class F2 CSL genes
of Rhizopus oryzae. Evolutionary pressure could have
favored proliferation and diversification of the CSL family
in this branch of zygomycetes, similarly to the expansions
that were documented for other gene families and phyla,
such as, e.g., nuclear hormone receptors and nematodes,
or calmodulin-type proteins and dictyostelids, respectively [28,29]. A history of gene losses and duplications in
the fungal lineage has also been described for proteins
involved in various RNA silencing phenomena [30]. The
metazoan CSL genes (class M) obviously underwent
duplication too. It likely occurred in the common ancestor of all vertebrates and gave rise to the RBP-L type of proteins, in addition to the RBP-Jκ type universally present in
both vertebrate and invertebrate animals. It should be
noted in this regard, that the RBP-L type gene is present in
zebrafish, but so far no homologs have been reported in
the genetically rather complicated clawed frog Xenopus laevis. We have also failed to identify an RBP-L homolog in
the more tractable species X. tropicalis, thus amphibians
likely have developed ways to regulate all their CSLresponsive genes using the RBP-Jκ homolog only. In summary, we have found representatives of the important
transcription factor family CSL, up to now generally considered metazoan-only, in several groups of fungi and
showed that they are an ancient gene family that originated much earlier than their current metazoan affiliates
like Notch or Mastermind [13].

The conservation of fungal CSL proteins
The degree of conservation of CSL proteins across phylogeny is remarkable, given the evolutionary distances, and
points to an important role they likely play in cells [25].
The sequence similarity among metazoan CSL proteins is
extremely high and does not allow for finding functionally important regions directly from sequence comparison. On the other hand, the distant CSL homologs from
fungi may provide this information more readily. Indeed,
we have found that the most prominent conservation can
be found in the regions involved in DNA binding with the
critical residues and several motifs being invariant in all
proteins analyzed (see Fig. 2 and 3). As expected, when
compared to metazoans, the rate of divergence has been
much faster in fungi, especially in those having small
genomes, i.e. C. neoformans, S. pombe and S. japonicus [3133]. In fact, the C. neoformans CSL proteins are the most
divergent ones among fungi and their position in our phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4) differs from that expected by looking at the fungal tree of life [23]. Such discrepancy has also
been reported for other C. neoformans proteins [30] and it
has been demonstrated for S. pombe that various types of
proteins might produce inconsistent signals when used
for phylogenetic analyses [34].

There are numerous insertions separating the above-mentioned conserved sequence stretches, but these insertions
are often rich in amino acids that are likely to appear in
loops and solvent-exposed regions [35]. In addition, such
insertions are present, to a lesser degree, also in the C. elegans LAG-1, the most evolutionarily primitive CSL protein
studied so far [17]. It may be argued that the fungal insertions could be an artifact produced by ORF misprediction.
We cannot rule out this possibility completely as the tools
for identifying exon-intron boundaries optimized for
diverse fungal species are limited or lacking. However,
many of these insertions are conserved among the classes
of CSL proteins and their positions mostly correspond to
the LAG-1 loops and regions exposed on the surface of the
protein [17]. Thus the general CSL fold may be well preserved in fungi.
Furthermore, the splicing pattern of some fungal CSL
genes is partially conserved among species (data not
shown) and the ORF predictions used in this study are in
good agreement with the multiple sequence alignment of
the proteins they encode. Nevertheless, the prediction
reliability of the non-conserved amino-terminal extensions found in some fungal CSL proteins remains questionable. The sequence similarity in the parts of the fungal
proteins corresponding to known coregulator interaction
sites in metazoans seems not to be significantly preserved.
This is of no great surprise as these coregulators are frequently involved in the Notch signaling pathway, which is
lacking in fungi, or are encoded by mammalian viruses

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/233

[5,13]. Also, the less-conserved metazoan RHR-C domain
of yet unknown function is very loosely defined in fungi,
as it was identified with confidence only in several class F2
members. Taken together, our data suggest that the fungal
CSL proteins may adopt the CSL fold and we further show
that these proteins posses notably conserved regions of
functional significance related mostly to their ability to
bind DNA in a sequence-specific manner.
The ancestral role of the CSL transcription factor family
Our current knowledge of the CSL family derives exclusively from metazoan model organisms and is based
mostly on studies concerning development and the Notch
pathway [2,9,13]. It is now clear that this is not the whole
picture as we have presented evidence of CSL proteins in
several organisms that are evolutionarily distant to animals and lack the critical Notch pathway components.
Moreover, recent reports on metazoan model organisms
indicate, that there are yet unrecognized CSL activities in
animals as well [7,8,10,11]. It is tempting to speculate that
the CSL ancestral function is preserved in the fungal proteins of today and maybe even in metazoans, where it
might be responsible for some of the Notch-independent
activities observed. If this is the case we would have excellent models, e.g., the genetically tractable fission yeast S.
pombe, to study it.

We hypothesize that the ancestral function is likely the
regulation of gene expression, where other signals than
Notch receptor activation are interpreted. Our first clue
comes from the analysis of fungal CSL sequence conservation, which clearly indicates their potential to bind DNA.
This includes not only DNA binding in general, but goes
further to the ability to recognize the strict CSL consensus.
The second clue derives from the lack of conservation of
CSL interacting partners from metazoans. As stated above,
the Notch receptor, its ligands and coactivators are not
present in fungi. Finally, the metazoan CSL proteins are
essential for embryonic development but dispensable in
cultured cells [6]. Similarly, the deletion of either or both
S. pombe CSL genes is viable (MP et al., manuscript in
preparation; and [36,37]). This suggests, together with the
secondary loss of CSL genes in some fungi (see above),
that the proposed ancestral function in gene regulation is
not essential.
We also have to account for the existence of two CSL
classes in fungi. There is analogy to the metazoan class M
sub-groups, the RBP-Jκ and RBP-L CSL types. Both are
involved in transcription regulation, but differ in their
interacting partners, their responsiveness to various signals, their expression profiles and their in vivo DNA-binding preferences [11,12]. The similar may be true for class
F1 and class F2 fungal CSL proteins. They may all participate in transcription regulation, but have either distinct or

only partially overlapping target gene sets. Alternatively,
they may differentially regulate the same genes, with the
outcome depending on, e.g., environmental conditions. It
was indeed found by whole-genome microarray experiments, that the S. pombe CSL genes display differential
expression during sexual differentiation and under various stress conditions [38,39]. In conclusion, the CSL gene
family encodes proteins that are likely universally
involved in the regulation of transcription both in animals and fungi.

Conclusion
We have shown the existence of CSL transcription factor
family, known from studies of the metazoan Notch signaling pathway, in several fungal species. We have
described conserved features of the fungal proteins supporting their identity as true CSL family members. These
findings put the CSL family origin further back in evolution, deeper than currently understood. We have mapped
the history of CSL gene duplication and gene loss events
in the fungal lineage, showing the existence of two welldefined CSL classes, class F1 and class F2, respectively,
with the second class being more similar to the metazoan
class M proteins. We hypothesize that the ancestral CSL
function involved DNA binding and Notch-independent
regulation of transcription and that this function may still
be shared, to a certain degree, by the present CSL family
members from both fungi and metazoans. If true, that
would allow for exploiting the simple fungal models to
analyze this function. We are currently studying the CSL
proteins role in S. pombe and experiments are underway to
identify the sets of genes and processes they regulate.

Methods
Database searches for CSL genes
We have searched multiple publicly available fungal
genome and protein databases (including NCBI [40] and
UniProt [41]) using the appropriate BLAST algorithm
with default settings and with the mouse CBF1 protein
[GenBank:NP_033061] as a query. Candidate hits containing at least one of the conserved CSL motifs (see
Results) were considered and used for further analyses.
The BLAST searches were then repeated with all the newly
identified CSL sequences as queries until no more new
hits were found. In cases where two or more nearly-identical candidate sequences, coming from independent
sources and obviously representing a single gene, were
found, the sequence showing the highest degree of similarity to the fungal CSL consensus was chosen. The final
searches were performed between November 24, 2006
and November 30, 2006.
Gene models prediction and verification
All candidate fungal CSL proteins were checked for the
quality of their ORF prediction. We compared each data-

http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/8/233

base gene model with GenScan [42] and/or WebGene
[43] predictions. The models were also compared to a
multiple sequence alignment of other CSL proteins. In
some cases, the splicing pattern was corrected manually
using the Gene Runner 3.05 software (Hastings Software,
Inc.) in order to restore a highly conserved region (see
Results and Additional files 1 and 2).
Conserved domain search and protein localization
prediction
Known domains present in the fungal CSL proteins were
searched for by the Search Pfam server [19]. Subcellular
localization of each CSL protein was predicted by three
independent algorithms, namely SubLoc v1.0 [44],
CELLO v.2.5 [45] and PSORT II [46]. Each sequence
received score ranging from '-' to '+++' depending on the
number of times the protein was predicted to be nuclear
(see Table 1).
Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses
Alignments used during the sequence retrieval part of the
study were performed using ClustalW [47]. The final
alignment of all identified fungal and selected metazoan
CSL proteins was based on a ClustalX output (Blosum
matrix series) [48], which was then manually edited in
BioEdit 7.0.5.3 to correct some obvious alignment errors
and to account for the information from the C. elegans
CSL protein crystal structure [17]. See Additional file 3 for
the final alignment and the list of metazoan sequences
used.

For tree construction all positions containing gaps were
removed from the final sequence alignment. An unrooted
phylogenetic tree was then generated for the region corresponding to RHR-N and BTD domains (from helix α2 just
before the βC4 linker, residues 210–535 in the C. elegans
LAG-1 reference protein, see [17]) using the neighborjoining method in the MEGA 3.1 software package [49]
with 2000 bootstrap replicates.
